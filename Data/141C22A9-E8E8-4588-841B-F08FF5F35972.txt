Abstract
A metal/multi-insulator/metal waveguide plasmonic Bragg grating with a large dynamic range of index modu-
lation is investigated analytically and numerically. Theoretical formalism of the dispersion relation for the present
and general one-dimensional gratings is developed for TM waves in the vicinity of each stop band. Wide-band and
narrow-band designs with their respective FWHM bandwidths of 173.4 nm and < 3.4 nm in the 1550 nm band using
a grating length of < 16.0 µm are numerically demonstrated. Time-average power vortexes near the silica-silicon
interfaces are revealed in the stop band and are attributed to the contra-flow interaction and simultaneous satisfactions
of the Bragg condition for the incident and backward-diffracted waves. An enhanced forward-propagating power is
thus shown to occur over certain sections within one period due to the power coupling from the backward-diffracted
waves.

I. INTRODUCTION
NAnophotonics using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) that are light waves coupled to oscillationsof free elections in a metal [1] has been attracting much renewed attention worldwide in last
decade. The interest in nanophotonics using SPPs, also called plasmonics, stems from its nanometer-
scale confinement that overcomes the lower limit of the lateral mode size of a conventional dielectric
waveguide [2], [3]. This makes it possible in realizing optical nanocircuitry and in eventually bringing light
into nanoelectronics [4], all using mature semiconductor manufacturing technologies. The confinement and
guidance of electromagnetic energy in the sub-wavelength and even toward sub-100-nm scale structures
thus become fundamental yet paramount in further down scaling conventional photonic devices.
Among various plasmonic devices, plasmonic Bragg gratings/reflectors realized in metal heterostructures
[5], insulator-metal-insulator (IMI)[6], [7], [8], metal-insulator-metal (MIM) [9], [10], [11], [12], or metal-
dielectric-air [13] configurations have been drawing continuing interest in recent years. While ultra narrow
band (below 1 nm up to 5 nm) plasmonic Bragg gratings have been experimentally demonstrated using the
IMI configuration for long-range SPPs [6], [7], narrow band MIM-based structures seem less studied. In
[12], a 3rd-order waveguide Bragg grating in the MIM configuration was numerically demonstrated where
a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 61 nm was reported with a total grating length of
30.6 µm. More recently, we proposed a metal/multi-insulator/metal (MMIM) waveguide plasmonic grating
where design examples with the grating lengths of ≤ 6.8 µm and the FWHM bandwidths of approximately
9 nm in the 1310 nm band were numerically demonstrated [14].
In this paper, general formalism and transmission characteristics of the MMIM waveguide plasmonic
Bragg grating with sinusoidal periodic variations are developed and investigated. The present study starts
with the simplification of the two-dimensional (2-D) structure into one-dimensional (1-D) longitudinally-
modulated medium where the wave equation may be cast into the canonical form of Hill’s differential
equation for transverse magnetic (TM) waves. The dispersion relation and its properties are then derived
and discussed in section 3. The dynamic range of the complex effective permittivity with varying structure

Figure 2 illustrates the isometric plots of the real and imaginary parts of the Neff associated with the
fundamental odd vector parity mode for an unperturbed linear MMIM waveguide with varying wgap and
wSi at a free-space wavelength of λ0 = 1550 nm. The refractive indices nSi = 3.5 and nsilica = 1.46 were
assumed and the dielectric function of the silver was taken as a complex fit to the empirical data reported
in [16]. The Neff values were calculated based on the rigorous transmission-line network approach in
conjunction with the transverse resonance condition [17].
In general, for a fixed wgap, Re [Neff] increases and the magnitude of Im [Neff] (|Im [Neff]|) decreases
with the increase in wSi. This must be the case since the increase in wSi comes with the increasing
fractions of the total electromagnetic energy being confined in the Si stripe. On the other hand, for a
fixed wSi, the decrease in wgap would lead to larger Re [Neff] and |Im [Neff]|. This is due to increasing
fractions of the total electromagnetic energy entering into the metal upon decreasing wgap, resulting in
slightly larger Re [Neff] and higher |Im [Neff]| that accounts for the ohmic loss inside the metal. Hence
for a fixed wSi, MMIM configuration bears the same characteristic as that of conventional MIM plasmonic
waveguide where Re [Neff] and |Im [Neff]| increase with the decreasing dielectric thickness.
The presence of the high-index Si stripe adds another degree of freedom to the index modulation in
plasmonic grating designs. While the largest Re [Neff] difference for all fixed wSi values in Fig. 2(a) is
merely 0.1874 [2.6735 at (wgap, wSi) = (160, 100) to 2.8609 at (wgap, wSi) = (50, 100)], geometries with
a fixed wgap and varying wSi may offer a larger dynamic range of index modulation of up to 0.7692
[from 2.6735 at (wgap, wSi) = (160, 100) to 3.4427 at (wgap, wSi) = (160, 400)]. The rate of change of
Re [Neff] increases rapidly with wSi ≤ 200 nm while the magnitude of Im [Neff] remains < 5.042× 10−5
for wSi ≥ 200 nm.
To fully utilize the large dynamic range of the Neff over the spans of wgap and wSi shown in Fig. 2,
both wide-band and narrow-band designs operating in the 1550 nm band are numerically demonstrated.
The Bragg wavelength is estimated using Eq. (14) and the Neff calculations shown in Fig. 2, which will
be elaborated in detail later for the narrow-band designs. Figure 3 shows the transmission spectra of an
MMIM grating with Λ, A0, AM , and wgap being 950, 250, 90, and 130 nm, respectively, and different
numbers of periods. The transmission spectra were obtained based upon 2-D Finite Element Method
simulations (Comsol Multiphysics) with the maximum mesh size of 20 nm in the entire computational
domain so as to achieve the power convergence to the 4th decimal digit. The refractive indices of Si
and silica were assumed constant across the spectrum of interest. For the 9-period case, the stop band
is centered at λ0 = 1552.3 nm and the FWHM bandwidth is 173.4 nm. The pass band ripple becomes
smaller as the operating wavelength deviates further away from the stop band.

The Pnorm distributions inside the 6th unit cell of case 2 in Fig. 4 at λ0 = 1600 nm are shown in Fig. 5(a)
as a representative case. Power interchange between the Si stripe and the silica gap regions, as indicated
by the arrows in the figure, is observed and occurs repeatedly throughout the entire grating. A quantitative
description of the power interchange may be obtained through the calculation of the x-directed time-
average power in the Si stripe and the silica gap regions over the span of one period. Figure 5(b) depicts
the normalized x-component of the time-average power Px(x), where

Si stripe (Px, Si) has the minimum. Note that the Px, gap shown in Fig. 6 is the sum of the normalized x-

Px, Si (Px, gaps) and the negative (backward-propagating) Px, gaps (Px, Si) at the same x position indicates
the occurrence of contra-flow coupling, as has been suggested by the hyperbolic form of the dispersion
relation, Eq. (12). On the other hand, a one-to-one correspondence exists between the x positions at which
the Px, Si (Px, gaps) undergoes zero-crossing in Fig. 6(b) and the 4 power nulls along the center line of the
Si stripe (at the silver-silica interfaces) in Fig. 6(a). The zero crossings shown in Fig. 6(b) are formed due
to the cancellation of the forward- and backward-propagating Px at these x positions. Likewise, power
nulls found along the x axis in the Si stripe and at the silver-silica interfaces are where the cancellations
of x- and y-directed time-average power occur simultaneously.

in the y direction.
It is immediately apparent that Px, Si around x = 0.4Λ exceeds unity in Fig. 6(b). The physical
interpretation may be made in terms of the behavior of the backward-diffracted waves at the Bragg
wavelength. The plane-wave spectrum calculated at the end of the 6th unit cell as a representative case is
shown in Fig. 7. At this x position, the plane-wave component with ky = 0 is dominant whereas another
two components at ky/(k0
√
ǫ) = ±0.14324 are also appreciable. The diffracted angles θ associated with
these components are 0◦ and ±8.24◦ (measured from the −x axis), respectively. In other words, the
diffracted wave vectors are either parallel to or nearly parallel to the −x axis and are governed by
the Floquet condition. It is worth mentioning that the plane-wave spectrum varies with the x position.
Specifically, slight changes in the diffracted angles and the normalized intensity associated with each
plane-wave component were observed across one period. This is expected since the interference pattern
produced by all the Floquet waves has to be consistent with the sinusoidally-modulated index variation
that produces them in the first place.
Consider the backward-diffracted wave with ky = 0 (or equivalently θ = 0◦), its wave vector is found to
be σ = |βinc − 6K| = 1.33969×107 (rad/m), where βinc is the incident wave vector, and the corresponding
phase velocity refractive index is Nσ = 3.3057. Using these values and the fact that the grating slant angle
φ = 0◦ (seen by the backward-diffracted wave) measured from the −x axis, the backward-diffracted wave
is found to satisfy the general Bragg condition
cos(φ− θ)− mλ0
2NσΛ
= 0, (17)
in which λ0 = 1550.4 nm, Λ = 1405 nm, and m = 5.9914 ≈ 6. Note that the refractive index of the
backward-diffracted wave Nσ = 3.3057 is very close to the average effective refractive index of the grating,

IQEC/CLEO Pacific Rim – International Quantum Electronics Conference (IQEC) and 
Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO) Pacific Rim 
Aug. 28 – Sept. 1, 2011, Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, Sydney, Australia  
Notes by Dr. Yin-Jung Chang (yjchang@ncu.edu.tw) 
 
Sydney, one of the well-known mega cities in the world, is famous for its Sydney Opera House and 
Sydney Harbor Bridge, where the spectacular fireworks are set off at the turn of every New Year. Like 
the New York City, Sydney impresses me with its busy streets, cool people, nice architectures, quiet 
and sunshine afternoon along the seashore of Sydney Harbor, and, of course, the Royal Botanical 
Garden which I think may probably outshine the Central Park. And like most of the international cities, 
it seems to be a pretty liberal place. 
 
The IQEC/CLEO Pacific Rim was held in Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre this year. There 
were about 400 registered participants and it seems there were not many companies at the exhibition. 
This was no surprise as the world economy has been in downturn since late 2008 and European debt 
crisis has been continued to hit the headlines for months. My impression was that there were very 
limited signs of cautious optimism on both research grants and commercial markets in optics and 
photonics.  
 
Poster presentation: 
The poster session was attended by a rather larger crowd (about 150 attendees would be my guess), 
though there were not many people stopping by. Our poster is entitled “Broadband omnidirectional 
antireflection coatings for metal-backed CIGS solar cells optimized using simulated annealing 
algorithm incorporated with solar spectrum” which deals with the antireflection coating designs for a 
general metal-backed solar cell with finite absorption thickness, rather than being infinite in extent that 
has long been assumed in the literature. The work was well received by a few attendees, especially Prof. 
Jia-Han Li, who is an associate professor in the Department of Engineering Science and Ocean 
Engineering, National Taiwan University. He asked if we developed the codes or just used some 
commercial software and the reason for anomalous peaks around ¸0 = 400 nm in the angle-averaged 
reflectance spectrum calculations.   
 
I also had some nice discussions with Dr. Christopher Poulton (senior lecturer, School of Mathematical 
Sciences at Univ. of Technology Sydney) on his poster entitled “Radiation dynamics in a magneto-
dielectric metamaterial cylinder.” The work deals with the radiation dynamics of an electric line current 
source in a homogeneous, magneto-dielectric cylinder. The emission of a source placed in a magneto-
dielectric cylinder, whose magnetic properties are controlled by changing the permeability ¹ , is 
investigated. It is interesting to learn that the radiation by the source is most enhanced by maximizing 
the magnetic response of the cylinder. 
 
Regarding the research area which my poster could be fit into, my observation is that there were only a 
few publications (may be less than a dozen) on solar-cell-related research this year. And only two 
papers were produced by non-Taiwanese groups (one is from Japan and the other from Germany), both 
of which address organic solar cells. The explanation to this interesting situation could go either way: 
the research on solar cells in Taiwan may be in the forefront of this area or way behind!

A Plasmonic-Mode-Assisted Sharp Waveguide Bend
for Silicon Optical Nanocircuitry
Yin-Jung Chang, Member, IEEE, and You-Chang Liu
Abstract—A novel plasmonic-mode-assisted sharp waveguide
bend in a metal/multi-insulator configuration for transverse-mag-
netic (TM) polarization is proposed and investigated at the
operating wavelength of 1550 nm. The bending efficiency defined
as the normalized transmission with respect to the straight coun-
terpart of the bend could be larger than unity and is attributed to
the net power flow into the bend. An insertion loss of 0.14 dB has
been numerically shown to be attainable with the present sharp
bend.
Index Terms—Surface plasmons, waveguide bends, waveguides.
I. INTRODUCTION
S ILICON-BASED waveguide has been of great interestfor many years in the micro-photonics regime for its high
refractive-index contrast, low loss, and ease of fabrication
through mature semiconductor technologies. However, further
downscaling waveguiding structures is limited by the diffrac-
tion limit and strong subwavelength field confinement thus
becomes crucially important. Nanophotonics using surface
plasmon polaritons (SPPs), also termed plasmonics, has been
consequently considered as a potential solution in realizing
optical nanocircuitry.
Among various photonic devices, the waveguide bend is one
of the most important building blocks, regardless of the tech-
nology/material system upon which it is based. Silicon-based
sharp waveguide bends have been widely investigated and can
be implemented using a square resonator at the bend with a
45 -cut at its outer corner [1], air trenches [2], 50-nm-wide
silicon (Si) slot waveguide with a radius of curvature m
[3], or a corner mirror of about 2.25 m in area plus a reso-
nant cavity [4]. Plasmonics-based sharp bends have also been
reported in the literature, such as the one based on metal-dielec-
tric-metal waveguide [5] or the S-bend using dielectric-loaded
SPP waveguide[6]. However, the potential of combining Si- and
plasmonics-based waveguides in implementing sharp bends
seems less explored.
In this letter, a new sharp waveguide bend in metal/multi-
insulator configuration is proposed and investigated. The pro-
posed structure presents a radical departure from the classic res-
onant transmission effect and air trenches reported in the litera-

II. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS
The essence of using metallic material in a Si-based sharp
bend is to have the plasmonic mode carry a portion of trans-
verse magnetic (TM) modal power in the conventional Si wave-
guide. Fig. 1 depicts the two-dimensional (2-D) schematic of
the proposed sharp waveguide bend. It consists of a silica gap
region sandwiched by a 100-nm-wide silver strip and a Si wave-
guide core region, all surrounded by air. The refractive indexes
of silica, Si, and silver are assumed to be 1.46, 3.5, and
at a free-space wavelength nm.
The plasmonic eigenmode was first shown to exist in
3-D metal/multi-insulator configuration with a thickness of
300 nm by 3-D Finite-Element-Method computations. Further,
its excitation through the linear taper was also numerically
demonstrated by 3-D Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD)
method (FullWAVE, RSOFT Design Group). It is worth men-
tioning that when performing a -cut at the middle of the
composite waveguide, the field distributions (bird’s-eye view)
are very similar to those in 2-D FDTD simulations, except a
major difference in field periodicity due to different effective
mode indexes associated with the 2-D and 3-D structures.
Since the 3-D FDTD method is computationally intensive, the

power in the air region couples back into the Si core. This ap-
plies to all the cases presented and the 350-nm case draws in
10.3% more power when compared to the 290-nm one. On the
other hand, the straight structures for the bending efficiency
calculations are always lossy along the whole Si-air boundary.
Since the 290-nm case is lossier than its straight counterpart,
its bending efficiency is less than unity. For the 350-nm design,
there is a net power flowing into the joint boundary ,

of a straight, 450-nm-wide Si waveguide of identical length
is above 96.8%. Hence the insertion loss introduced by the
entire metal/multi-insulator structure is dB. The peak
plasmonic modal power throughout the bending section is
above 45.2% of the input power. The plasmonic mode thus
retains a large amount of power that would otherwise give up
from the sharp Si waveguide bend due to the frustrated total
internal reflection.
IV. SUMMARY
A plasmonic-mode-assisted sharp waveguide bend for
TM polarization is proposed, analyzed, and numerically
demonstrated. With the asymmetric metal/multi-insulator
configuration and appropriate designs, the plasmonic mode is
shown to carry more than 45.2% of the input power through
the bending section and an insertion loss of dB could
be achieved with a bending length of less than one-third of the
operating wavelength. This research may therefore be of real
value in a broad range of Si-based nanocircuity.

1. Introduction
High-index contrast dielectric waveguides have been in widespread use for many years as they
offer a strong mode confinement, dense integration, low propagation loss (if smooth sidewalls
are attainable), and the ease of fabrication through mature semiconductor technologies. How-
ever, further downscaling waveguiding structures for the realization of optical nanocircuitry
is hampered by the natural diffraction limit and strong sub-wavelength field confinement thus
becomes crucially important. Nanophotonics using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) that can
be guided by metallic subwavelength structures beyond diffraction limit is now considered as a
promising solution for the implementation of optical nanocircuitry [1, 2].
For either long-term developed dielectric- or emerging plasmonics-based photonic devices
and circuits, the waveguide bend is one of the most important building blocks and has been
attracted continued attention for the last 40 years [3–5]. Among various bend designs, air
trenches etched into the substrate have been extensively investigated in high- and low-index-
contrast material systems [6–13]. Corner mirrors formed by deeply-etched reflecting facets,
on the other hand, are often found in rib/ridge waveguides [14–16]. Alternatively, low-Q res-
onant cavity [14, 17] and the use of a photonic crystal region as a 90◦ corner [18] have also
been thoroughly studied. In contrast, plasmonics-based waveguide bends using a simple metal-
dielectric-metal waveguide [19], metal micrograting as Bragg mirrors [20], V-groove at 30◦ in
silver with a wedge pillar defect in the corner [21], dielectric-loaded SPP [22], and 3-D metallic
slot waveguides [5] have also been reported in the literature.
Over the years, the research and developments in sharp waveguide bends have long been
restricted exclusively to either dielectric- or plasmonic-based material systems. Because of
their ultrasmall footprints, low-Q resonant cavity [17] and some corer mirror designs [14] may
be most well-suited for high-density photonic integrations. However, they were investigated
strictly for TE polarization and according to our studies [3-nm grid size and a slab mode excita-
tion in two-dimensional (2-D) numerical simulations at λ0 = 1550 nm], the respective TE and

(FullWAVETM, RSOFT Design Group). Although being the most memory efficient numerical
method, the 3-D FDTD simulation is still computational costly; thus the proposed sharp bend
was investigated using 2-D FDTD with a minimum grid size of 3 nm in order for the conver-
gence of numerical results.
The concept of incorporating a metallic material in Si-based sharp waveguide bends orig-
inates from different modal characteristics associated with TE and TM modes at the metal-
dielectric boundary. The idea is to have the plasmonic mode carry a portion of the TM modal
energy that is initially confined in the Si core and to confine the TE mode by means of a
metal/low-index-dielectric boundary acting as a reflection plane. By investigating the structure
parameters analytically and numerically, including input taper length lin, lengths of linear sec-
tions l1 and l2, bending length lbend, bending width wbend, output taper length lout, and the
lateral offsets δoffset,in and δoffset,out associated with the respective input and output tapers,
we show that a polarization-insensitive subwavelength sharp waveguide bend could be imple-
mented with the present metal/multi-insulator configuration.
3. Dispersion relations of TE and TM eigenmodes
The TE and TM dispersion relations from which the effective mode indexes of guided modes
(Neff =√εeff) are obtained are the most important equations in describing the guidance char-
acteristics associated with the proposed waveguide. The 2-D schematic (top view) of a general
metal/multi-layer structure is depicted in Fig. 2. Each layer is characterized by its thickness hi
and relative permittivity εi, i = {m,1,2, · · · ,n}, where the subscript m stands for the metal. For
the case presented in Fig. 1, ε1, ε2, and ε3 correspond to the relative permittivities of silica, Si,
and air, respectively (ε1 = εsilica, ε2 = εSi, ε3 = 1.0). For simplicity, both metal (εm) and the
bottommost dielectric (εn) layers are assumed to be semi-infinite in extent.

The general dispersion relation can be obtained conveniently based upon the transmission-
line network approach incorporated with the transverse resonance condition

where Zup and Zdn denote the input impedance seen looking upward and downward from the
reference plane, respectively. The characteristic impedance Z0,i of the transmission line associ-
ated with the i-th layer is given by

P = (Z0 +Z2)+(Z0−Z2)e− j2κ2h2 (15)
Q = (Z0 +Z2)− (Z0−Z2)e− j2κ2h2 . (16)
Equations (9) and (10) can then be numerically solved for the complex effective refractive
index Neff using the complex Newton’s method [23]. The effective mode index will be used in
section 4 in developing the design rules for the proposed sharp bend.
4. Design and optimization
A systematic approach, starting with the input linearly-tapered section, was taken in the de-
sign and optimization of the proposed sharp bend. In this approach, the entire structure was
divided into several building blocks, each of which was successively optimized. The design,
optimization, and their physical reasonings are described below.
4.1. Input linearly-tapered section
The input taper is described by the taper length lin and the lateral offset δoffset,in defined as
δoffset,in ≡ x1 − xin, which is the x-position difference between the center line of the linear
section and that of the input waveguide (Fig. 1). Figure 3 shows the isometric plots of the
transmission (coefficient) as a function of lin and δoffset,in for both mode types. For the TE
mode, the silver-silica boundary effectively resembles a reflection plane with a minimal field
penetration. Accordingly, TE behaviors along the linear and linearly-tapered sections would
be very similar to that along an asymmetric, single-layer slab waveguide. Hence, as is seen in
Fig. 3(a), for all lin values under consideration, their respective transmissions are only slightly
skewed toward negative δoffset,in and are nearly identical at δoffset,in = −10 nm, which is
close to the zero-offset point. The highest TE transmission falls within δoffset,in = [10, 35]nm
for lin ≤ 900 nm.
A positive δoffset,in is required for the TM mode to compensate for a shorter lin in order to
maintain > 90% TM transmission at the end of input taper. However, its functionality becomes
minimum for lin ≥ 800 nm for both mode types. Further investigations show that, for lin > 700
nm, the TM power channeled in the silica gap varies merely within 2.79% over the span of
δoffset,in (not shown in the figure). This indicates that the phase matching condition is fulfilled
and is hardly altered with varying lin if lin is sufficiently large. The parameters lin and δin are
thus chosen to be 700 nm and 45 nm, respectively, for maintaining transmissions of 88.18% and
96.09% for the respective TE and TM modes at a position 300 nm away from the taper end.
It should be emphasized that, physically, δoffset,in is intended to adjust the equi-phase front
associated with the y-directed complex Poynting vector so that it is nearly in parallel to that
along the liner metal/multi-insulator waveguide section for minimizing the mode mismatch.
This can be also perceived in Fig. 4.
4.2. Linear metal/multi-insulator section
The functionality of linear metal/multi-insulator sections (l1 and l2) before and after the bending
section is to ensure the equi-phase front associated with the y-directed complex Poynting vector
Py is phase-matched (“well-aligned”) across each boundary and is (nearly) perpendicular to the
y axis, as shown in Fig. 4. The phase mismatch across each interface along the taper section is
clearly seen for the TM mode owing to the phase mismatch associated with the x-directed elec-
tric field. On the contrary, the TE phase front is always continuous across the boundaries and
is perpendicular to the y axis right after the input taper end. Compared to the TE case, the TM
mode requires approximately another 225 nm for its phase front to become well-aligned. Thus
both l1 and l2 were set to 364 nm, which is approximately one half the TM guided wavelength.

The dependency of the bending efficiency on wbend and lbend is illustrated in Fig. 5. Simula-
tions were conducted with varying bending length at a 10-nm step for differing bending widths.
Curves shown in Fig. 5 were obtained through curve fitting of the discrete data. To provide an
insight into this figure, it may be necessary to express the physical dimensions in terms of the
guided wavelength. Using the dispersion relations, Eqs. (9) and (10), the effective refractive
indexes (Neff) of the fundamental mode for wbend ranging from 290 nm to 350 nm and their
corresponding guided wavelengths at λ0 = 1550 nm were obtained (Table 1). Notice that with
the increase in wbend, the imaginary part of the effective index (Im [Neff]) decreases and the real
part (Re [Neff]) increases as more electromagnetic energy is confined within the Si core region.
These results are shown to be significant in understanding the transmission behaviors discussed
below.

For the TE mode, transmission valleys exist for wbend ≥ 310nm owing to the resonance-like
field behavior. The z-component of the electric field Ez is shown as an inset in Fig. 5(a) for
(wbend, lbend) = (350,250) nm as a representative case. It exhibits a standing-wave-like pattern
between the beginning of the input waveguide and the end of the bending section. However,

(C) 2011 OSA 14 February 2011 / Vol. 19,  No. 4 / OPTICS EXPRESS  3070
that, when wbend ≥ 330 nm, the bending efficiency is larger than unity for certain ranges of
lbend. Further investigations into the time-average Poynting vectors along the Si-air boundaries
reveal that this is determined by the combined net power flow across the boundaries AB, BC,
and CD [24]. In general, with the increase in wbend, a net power density is coupled across the
joint boundary ABCD into the Si core. The arguments also applies to those TE cases having
larger-than-unity bending efficiencies shown in Fig. 5(a).
4.4. Output linearly-tapered section
The output linearly-tapered section is equally important as the input one whenever the
plasmonic-to-photonic mode conversion is necessary in the photonic nanocircuitry. It is there-
fore described and optimized in a similar manner as is the input taper. The output lateral offset
defined as δoffset,out ≡ y2−yout is, like the input lateral offset, meant to reshape the equi-phase
front associated with the x-directed complex Poynting vector that would normally require a
longer taper length lout to “stabilize”. This is necessary since for both TE and TM modes the
metal/multi-insulator structure is asymmetric with respect to the direction of propagation as
opposed to the symmetric output Si waveguide. Thus the output taper serves as a transition
for minimizing mode mismatch due to structure variations. The optimum values for lout and
δoffset,in were found to be 660 nm and -85 nm, respectively.
5. Results and discussions
Figure 6 shows the time-average power flow for the optimized structure for TE and TM polar-
ization. The normalized end-to-end transmission to that of a straight, 450-nm-wide Si waveg-
uide of identical length is 98.07% for TE and 94.87% for TM, corresponding to the respective
insertion losses of < 0.085 dB and < 0.229 dB introduced by the entire metal/multi-insulator
structure. Also, it is worth mentioning that the insertion loss associated with the optimized
bend design without the silver region is found to be > 0.65 dB for TE and > 1.61 dB for TM.
This indicates that the metal/multi-insulator configuration can indeed significantly improve the
transmission efficiency, in particular for the TM mode.
The general design rules for the waveguide bend, in particular for the following five param-
eters
{
wgap, l1,wbend, lbend, l2
}
were derived from the 1550-nm case and are given in Table 2.
They were subsequently tested on the bend design at λ0 = 1310 nm and produced immediate re-
sult of > 90% end-to-end transmission for both mode types without further optimization. Note
that wbend expressed in terms of the free-space wavelength uniquely determines lbend through
the calculation of TE effective mode index.

As is shown in Fig. 6(b), time-average power varies within the Si core and silica gap in
the direction of propagation, suggesting power interchange exists between these two regions.
The investigation of power interchange (or photonic-plasmonic mode conversion in the case
presented) is therefore necessary in gaining physical insight into the waveguiding structures of
this kind. However, before further investigations could be made on the sharp waveguide bend,

critical angles for the two core-cladding interfaces are exceeded, the ray associated with the
radiation mode can be totally internally reflected at both interfaces and the guidance condition
is satisfied. In the present case, since the structure is asymmetric and the radiation modes are
incident from the lower-index region, it can be shown that if the total internal reflection (TIR)
condition is satisfied at the silica-Si interface, then the TIR condition at the Si-air interface will
also be satisfied. To have the TIR take place at the silica-Si interface, the following condition

(1.87%). However, the largest difference in Psilica from G′ to H ′ in Fig. 8(a) is 3.56%. Further
investigations show that the increase in Psilica is mainly supplied by the radiation from the air
region as the TIR at Si-silica interface is not attainable. Similar arguments are also applicable
to sections beyond C′-H and H-H ′ cuts as the structure is symmetric from A-E ′ to D-J′ cuts
with respect to the middle of the bending section.
For the TM mode, mode conversions in the form of the power transfer between PSi and
Psilica are clearly seen in Fig. 8(b). Before the A-E ′ cut, both PSi and Psilica curves are nearly
identical to those in the straight case. As the Si core width increases from B-F to B′-G cuts,
the power inside the core also increases while that in the silica gap decreases. Compared to
that along the linear taper, a relatively weaker power transfer is observed over the span of the
bending section. This is due to a larger phase mismatch as a direct consequence of a larger
core width. Likewise, the decrease in PSi and the increase in Psilica from C′-H to C-I cuts
stem from the decreasing Si core width. Hence the power interchange between PSi and Psilica
merely reflects the inevitable energy redistribution in order to fulfill the guidance condition for
the TM mode in each section. As a result, the structure-enabled successive mode conversions
in reality increase the modal power within the Si core and have the plasmonic mode carry up to
42.6% of the input power along the bending section.
6. Summary
A new polarization-insensitive sharp waveguide bend in asymmetric, 2-D metal/multi-insulator
configuration has been detailed. The transmission through the bending section is assisted to a
large extent by the plasmonic mode for the TM-polarized field and by the metal/low-index-
dielectric boundary that resembles a reflection plane for the TE. These could only be achieved
by introducing a low-index dielectric between the metal and high-index core regions. The dis-
persion relations governing the guided TE and TM modes in a general metal/multi-insulator
waveguide have been developed and subsequently used in seeking the design rules for the
waveguide bend in terms of the free-space/TE/TM guided wavelengths. The insertion loss of
the proposed sharp bend is shown to be < 0.085 dB for TE and < 0.229 dB for TM. Power
interchange study reveals that the combined TE modal and radiation power in the air region
can couple back to the conventional Si waveguide through the output taper section, leading to
a high end-to-end TE transmission. Photonic-plasmonic mode conversions are shown to occur
for the TM mode at each structure discontinuity along the bend, giving rise to an increase in the
photonic mode confinement while having the plasmonic mode carry the rest of the input power
that would otherwise give up in the absence of the metal.

1. Introduction
Designed to minimize light reflection at the refractive index discontinuity, antireflection (AR)
coating has long been a fundamental yet vital subject in various applications in optics. The most
well-known AR coating may be the quarter-wavelength film having a refractive index equal
to the geometric mean of the indices of two different materials between which the quarter-
wavelength film is applied. With the increasing demands in reducing green house gases, solar
cells have been gaining much renewed attention worldwide in recent years for one purpose only:
to cost-effectively enhance their efficiency. Depending on the materials used for the absorbing
layer(s) and the transparency regime of the conductive/buffer layers, the typical spectral range

the optimized results more practically applicable. A succinct description of SA applied to the
AR coating optimization is given below.
2.1. Simulated annealing optimization
SA is a global optimization algorithm that finds the global minimum of the cost function as-
sociated with the problem of interest through a number of function evaluations. It explores
the image of the cost function by performing random walks in m space, where m denotes the
number of parameters to be optimized. In the present work, the m variables are the physical
layer parameters, including the individual layer thickness t and the corresponding wavelength-
dependent permittivity ε(λ ). A parameter vector X = [x1,x2, · · · ,xm]T (the superscript T de-
notes transpose) may thus be defined with its elements being the physical parameters ti and
εi(λ ) associated with the i-th layer. The number m is then two times the number of layers
used in the AR coating. The lower and upper limits of xu (i.e. au ≤ xu ≤ bu, u = 1,2, · · · ,m)
correspond to the smallest and largest physically realizable values of the layer thickness or rela-
tive permittivity. Let C(X) be the cost function evaluating the average reflectance over certain
ranges of incident angles and wavelengths. The algorithm attempts to minimize C(X) that can
be analytically obtained through the formalism of a general scattering problem associated with
a multi-layer structure.
Starting from an arbitrary initial setting of X (i.e., the initial configuration of an AR coating)
which in turn initializes the performance parameter (i.e., the reflectance) by calculating C(X),
SA randomly generates new physical parameter vector Xk+1 by applying random moves along
each coordinate direction u
Xk+1 = Xk + rV eTu , (1)
where k is the iteration index, r a random number in the range of [−1,1], V the step vector in the
form of diagonal matrix, and eu a row vector so that {eu, u = 1,2, · · · ,m} forms the standard
ordered basis for Rm [16] [for instance, if m = 4, then e3 = (0,0,1,0)]. The change in xu is valid
only if it falls within the domain of C(X), namely au < xu < bu. The acceptance or rejection of
the newly-generated parameter vector Xk+1 is determined by the Metropolis criterion [17] in
which downhill moves
[
∆Ck,k+1 < 0, where ∆Ck,k+1 = C(Xk+1)−C(Xk)
]
are always accepted,
whereas uphill moves are allowed if a randomly-generated number p satisfies the expression
p < exp
(−∆Ck,k+1/T), where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and T is the temperature targeted for each individual
phase during the cooling process. Note that the exponential term is the Boltzmann distribution.
Performing the above steps for every element in the vector X (i.e. u from 1 to m) completes one
cycle of random moves and the optimum AR coating configuration is updated every time when
∆Ck,k+1 < 0 occurs.
To have the algorithm closely follow the “function behavior”, a 1 : 1 rate between accepted
and rejected random moves in each coordinate direction is preferred. To this end, a step vector
adjustment after every NS cycles of random moves is required and is suggested by [13]

κi =

λ
√
εi − εa sin2 θ , (5)
where λ is the free-space wavelength and θ the angle of incidence measured from the surface
normal. Note that κi is in the direction transverse to the layer interface.
The reflection coefficient at the air-AR coating interface can be conveniently obtained using
the following expression
Γ(λ ,θ) = ZL,0+ −Z0,a
ZL,0+ +Z0,a
, (6)
in which ZL,0+ is the load impedance seen looking downward from the position z = 0+ (see
Fig. 1) and Z0,a the characteristic impedance of the line associated with the input air region.
The load impedance ZL,0+ may be calculated successively, starting from the bottommost layer
with the following general equation [20]
Zin, i = Z0, i
(
1+Γi, i+1e− j2κiti
1−Γi, i+1e− j2κiti
)
, (7)
where Zin, i designates the input impedance seen looking toward the end of the i-th layer from
right below the (i−1)-i interface and Γi, i+1 the reflection coefficient at the i-(i+1) interface
Γi, i+1 =
Zin, i+1 −Z0, i
Zin, i+1 +Z0, i
. (8)
The expression for Zin, i+1 is the same as that of Zin, i, except that i is now replaced by i + 1.
Since the characteristic impedance Z0, i is both wavelength- and angle-of-incidence-dependent,
so is the reflection coefficient.
The cost function C (X) for the SA optimization is then defined as the normalized solar
spectral irradiance w(λ ) times the arithmetic average of TE and TM reflectance averaged over
the angular and wavelength spectra,

where Iλ represents the solar irradiance spectrum and ΓTE and ΓTM are the reflection coefficients

the unit of C (X) is irrelevant to the final optimization result since the SA algorithm finds the
global minimum in the image of C (X). As a result, the solar irradiance spectrum itself can also
be directly used as the weighting function in Eq. (9) without losing the generality.

3.2. Bulk crystalline silicon solar cells
Because of its low cost character, Si solar cells are the most widely used photovoltaic devices
in today’s renewable-energy market. While one- and two-layer AR coatings have long been
commonly used for reducing the reflection, often they are seldom optimized for broadband and
wide angle-of-incidence operations.
Using the SA algorithm incorporated with the solar spectrum at Earth’s surface (AM1.57
radiation) [22], AR coatings for bulk crystalline Si solar cells having back reflectors with up
to six layers were optimized. The Si layer is assumed to have a thickness of 300 µm. The
spectral range of interest is from 400 nm to 1100 nm. The index domain of the cost function
C(X) is defined by some practically realizable refractive indices ranging from 1.05 to 2.66
[8, 23], whereas the range of thickness needs to be judiciously chosen in order not to tightly
restrict the random moves during the SA optimization. Table 2 lists the SA-synthesized AR
coatings for angle of incidence from 0◦ to 80◦. Note that the refractive index of each layer is a
weighted average averaged over the polarization and the spectral range of interest. It is apparent
that the optimized index vs. cumulative layer thickness is not necessarily of graded index. For
AR coatings with layers less than five, the SA algorithm does produce a graded-index profile;
however, for the five- and six-layer coatings, alternating low-index and high-index layers with
differing thicknesses were generated by SA. Also, the average reflectance Rave converges as the
smallest and largest indices are close to the limits of index domain (i.e. 1.05 and 2.66). When
this occurs, adding more layers with indices between the upper and lower limits can hardly
improve the average reflectance.
To better visualize the AR coating performance reported in Table 2, the angle-averaged re-
flectance Rθ -ave(λ ) defined by

for each coating configuration is depicted in Fig. 3. Because of the small absorption coefficient
of the crystalline Si at longer wavelengths, the angle-averaged reflectance increases precipi-
tously beyond approximately λ = 1000 nm, regardless of the number of layers used in the AR
coating. The average reflectance Rave decreases drastically if the contributions from λ ≥ 1000

3.3. CIGS solar cells
A typical CIGS solar cell is composed of a transparent conductive ZnO layer followed by
a thin n-type CdS buffer layer for lattice matching to the molybdenum-backed CIGS ab-
sorber [25]. The structure considered in the rigorous electromagnetic model then consists of a
ZnO/CdS/CIGS stack terminated by a PEC boundary condition. The dielectric functions asso-
ciated with ZnO [26], CdS [27], and CuIn1−xGaxSe2 with x = 0.31 [28], as well as the AM1.57
solar spectrum, were all taken into account. The gallium composition ratio of 0.31 was chosen
since it is typical of most high-efficiency CIGS solar cells [29, 30]. In the SA optimization, the
CIGS layer was assumed 2 µm in thickness and the refractive index interval for all AR coating
layers was limited from 1.05 to 2.00. Since, in general, both the external quantum efficiency
and solar irradiance spectrum decrease precipitously for λ < 350 nm [31,32], the contributions
from λ = [300,350] nm may be insignificant and having the AR coating be optimized in favor
of the spectrum covering stronger external quantum efficiency and solar irradiance may be of
more practical importance.
As indicated in Eq. (6) and in Fig. 1, the reflectance at the top surface of solar cells is deter-
mined by the input impedance seen looking toward the bottom layer from the surface. Hence
every single layer above the backside molybdenum contributes to the reflection coefficient. In
other words, while the CIGS layer thickness is fixed, ZnO and CdS layers could serve as a con-
stituent part of the AR coating so long as the solar cell efficiency and the low-cost fabrication

every New Year. Like the New York City, Sydney impresses me with its busy streets, cool 
people, nice architectures, quiet and sunshine afternoon along the seashore of Sydney Harbor, 
and, of course, the Royal Botanical Garden which I think may probably outshine the Central 
Park. And like most of the international cities, it seems to be a pretty liberal place. 
 
The IQEC/CLEO Pacific Rim was held in Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre this 
year. There were about 400 registered participants and it seems there were not many 
companies at the exhibition. This was no surprise as the world economy has been in 
downturn since late 2008 and European debt crisis has been continued to hit the headlines for 
months. My impression was that there were very limited signs of cautious optimism on both 
research grants and commercial markets in optics and photonics.  
 
Poster presentation: 
The poster session was attended by a rather larger crowd (about 150 attendees would be my 
guess), though there were not many people stopping by. Our poster is entitled “Broadband 
omnidirectional antireflection coatings for metal-backed CIGS solar cells optimized using 
simulated annealing algorithm incorporated with solar spectrum” which deals with the 
antireflection coating designs for a general metal-backed solar cell with finite absorption 
thickness, rather than being infinite in extent that has long been assumed in the literature. The 
work was well received by a few attendees, especially Prof. Jia-Han Li, who is an associate 
professor in the Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan 
University. He asked if we developed the codes or just used some commercial software and 
the reason for anomalous peaks around ¸0 = 400  nm in the angle-averaged reflectance 
spectrum calculations.   
 
I also had some nice discussions with Dr. Christopher Poulton (senior lecturer, School of 
Mathematical Sciences at Univ. of Technology Sydney) on his poster entitled “Radiation 
dynamics in a magneto-dielectric metamaterial cylinder.” The work deals with the radiation 
dynamics of an electric line current source in a homogeneous, magneto-dielectric cylinder. 
The emission of a source placed in a magneto-dielectric cylinder, whose magnetic properties 
are controlled by changing the permeability ¹, is investigated. It is interesting to learn that the 
radiation by the source is most enhanced by maximizing the magnetic response of the 
cylinder. 
 
Regarding the research area which my poster could be fit into, my observation is that there 
were only a few publications (may be less than a dozen) on solar-cell-related research this 
year. And only two papers were produced by non-Taiwanese groups (one is from Japan and 
the other from Germany), both of which address organic solar cells. The explanation to this 
interesting situation could go either way: the research on solar cells in Taiwan may be in the 
forefront of this area or way behind! 
 
will be asked to sign a copyright agreement at a later date.

3.  Results and Discussions 
The structure considered in the rigorous electromagnetic model for a typical CIGS solar cell consists of a stack of 
ZnO/CdS/CIGS terminated by a PEC (perfect electric conductor) boundary condition, as shown in the inset of Fig. 
1(a). The PEC termination condition is used to model the backside metal and the CIGS layer is assumed to be 2 ¹m 
in thickness. The dielectric functions associated with ZnO [4], CdS [5], and CuIn1¡xGaxSe2 with x = 0:31  [6], as 
well as the AM1.57 solar spectrum [7], were all taken into account. Since every single layer above the backside 
metal contributes to the reflection coefficient, ZnO and CdS layers could serve as part of the AR coating and thus 
need to be incorporated in the SA optimization. The results are given in Table 1 where Rave is the angle- and 
wavelength-averaged reflectance averaged over TE and TM polarization, as defined in Eq. (3) except w(¸) = 1 is 
assumed in this calculation.

coatings for CuIn1¡xGaxSe2jx=0:31 solar cells. The CIGS structure under consideration is shown in the

¸ = [350; 1200] nm and μ = [0±; 80±].

for each coating configuration is depicted in Fig. 1(a). The rapidly-varying behavior of Rμ¡ave in the wavelength 
range from about 370 nm to 415 nm is attributed to the 3.37 eV direct bandgap energy of ZnO [4]. The solar 
spectrum is shown to minimize and flatten Rμ¡ave curves for ¸ = [350; 700] nm , corresponding to the spectral 
range with stronger solar irradiance, when compared to those without the solar spectrum consideration (not shown).
