an important issue in the design and optimization of MHRs [13,31,32]. (For obvious 
reason, metal hydrides also can be used in heat storage systems; see [33, 34] for 
example.) 
Clearly, the hydriding and dehydriding processes in MHRs are rather complex 
since simultaneous heat and mass transfers take place with chemical reaction. In 
addition, the gas flow through the metal hydride powder—which may be thought of as 
a porous material with changing thermophysical properties as the reaction 
proceeds—adds further complexity to the processes. Numerical simulations of the 
hydriding and dehydriding processes therefore play an important part in the design 
and optimization of MHRs. Indeed, several mathematical models [35-44] and related 
experimental data [45, 46] for such simulations are available in the literature. Due to 
the synergetic interactions of the aforementioned factors, the performance of an MHR 
is highly sensitive to its operating conditions (such as the heat-transfer fluid 
temperature [47-50] and reactor inlet/exit pressure [49, 51-53]).   
An important question is: Can one “optimize” the performance of an MHR by 
properly setting its operating conditions? This issue is addressed in the first part of 
this study. Specifically, on the basis of an existing model, with realistic parameter 
values appropriate for the hydrogen reaction kinetics of LaNi5 (as a specific particular 
example in this report), we shall examine the possibility of increasing the steadiness 
 8 
 
improving the MHR performance through heat conduction augmentation has been 
clearly demonstrated. However, it appears that such works did not examine the effects 
of the metal-foam volume fraction (denoted below by , which is the ratio of the 
net volume occupied by the metal material to the apparent volume of the foam as a 
whole) on the overall MHR performance. This issue is worth addressing for the 
reason that, while the presence of a metal foam improves heat conduction in an MHR, 
it also reduces the amount of metal hydride powder that can be sealed in the MHR to 
store hydrogen. So, for an MHR to achieve a certain hydrogen storage capacity, there 
may exist an “optimal” choice of  value, and here we wish to explore such a 
possibility. As explained above, the objective of this study is to address the two 
important issues, namely the operating conditions and thermal management using 
metal foam, on the performance optimization of MHRs. In the following two sections, 
further background information and related literature of these two issues will be 
reviewed. 
 
1.2 Heat and Mass Transfer Modeling for MHRs 
Through theoretical modeling and numerical calculations, the first part of this 
study aims to understand the effect of exit pressure of an MHR on the hydrogen 
discharge rate, and to increase the steadiness of the hydrogen discharge rate by 
 10 
 
model for the heat and mass transfer in axisymmetric MHRs. Following Mayer et al. 
[70], they used two different expressions to describe the LaNi5–hydrogen reaction 
kinetics: one for hydrogen absorption [72], and the other for desorption [73]. 
Meanwhile, in the model of Jemni and Ben Nasrallah [72, 73] (hereafter referred to as 
the JBN model for brevity), convective heat transport was taken into account, and the 
assumption of local thermal equilibrium was not made. Their numerical results 
suggested that convective heat transport generally is not important in MHRs. 
However, near the solid wall of an MHR, where the heat flux usually is larger, the 
temperature difference between the hydrogen and metal hydride may be significant. 
But as such regions only occupy a relatively small space in an MHR, the assumption 
of local thermal equilibrium still can be used to simplify the calculations, and supply 
accurate predictions for the overall hydrogen absorption/desopetion characteristics 
[74]. Similar conclusions were reached in a later study by Nakagawa et al. [75]. Also, 
the numerical predictions of the JBN model, and the assumptions of local thermal 
equilibrium and negligible convective heat transfer in an MHR, were validated 
experimentally by Jemni et al. [76]. In a series of follow-up works, Askri et al. [77-79] 
then used the JBN model to study the effects of various factors—such as radiative 
heat transfer and the presence of a hydrogen expansion volume—upon the hydrogen 
absorption/desopetion characteristics of MHRs. Broadly speaking, it was concluded

achieve a certain hydrogen storage capacity, there may exist an “optimal” choice of 
 value (metal foam volume fraction), and here we wish to explore such a 
possibility. To serve this purpose, however, a slightly more comprehensive theoretical 
model than that cited above is needed. Briefly, the spatial variation of hydrogen 
pressure in the MHR was taken into account by Mellouli et al. [80], but was neglected 
in the model of Laurencelle and Goyette [69]. Meanwhile, both models did not 
explicitly consider the dependence of the hydrogen flow resistance on the metal-foam 
volume fraction. As the spatial non-uniformity of hydrogen pressure distribution in 
larger MHRs may be significant enough to affect the hydriding/dehydriding kinetics, 
here we shall basically follow the model of Mellouli et al. [80], but attach to it certain 
additional components to allow for a tunable metal-foam volume fraction. Meanwhile, 
to expedite computations, we shall also make the 1-D approximation like that in 
Laurencelle and Goyette [69]. The modified model will be explained in Chapter 4, 
and the numerical results of this modified model will be described and discussed in 
Chapter 5. 
 
1.4 Outline of this Report 
As explained above, the objective of this study is to examine how the operating 
conditions and thermal management using metal foam affect the performance of an 
 16 
 
into the important issue of MHR performance optimization.  
The numerical results are discussed systematically in Chapter 3. Briefly, it is 
found that, for a prescribed , increasing  generally increases the mean 
hydrogen discharge rate. Moreover, there exists a particular  that minimizes the 
variance ( ) of the hydrogen discharge rate, without much sacrifice of the mean 
hydrogen discharge rate. The MHR exit-pressure variation therefore can be 
“optimized” to discharge hydrogen with maximized temporal steadiness. It is also 
found that, for a prescribed tolerance of , a particular combination of  and  
can be chosen to discharge hydrogen at a maximum possible flow rate. A few other 
strategies for improving the MHR performance will be discussed in Chapter 3, too. 
As mentioned in §1.3, the modified model to determine the hydriding time of an 
MHR with an aluminum foam installed in it will be explained in Chapter 4, and the 
numerical results will be discussed in Chapter 5. After validating our modified model 
by comparing its numerical results with the experimental data of Laurencelle and 
Goyette [69] in §5.1, we shall discuss a series of parameter studies for a cylindrical 
MHR containing an annular metal foam of fixed apparent outer diameter (which 
equals the MHR internal diameter). The apparent inner radius ( ) and volume 
fraction ( ) of the metal foam are the design parameters. 
First, keeping constant the amount of metal hydride powder sealed in the reactor, 
 18 
 
findings are expected to be useful for optimizing the selection of metal-foam volume 
fraction for MHRs. Finally, additional remarks will be given in Chapter 6 to conclude 
this report.

consumption rate for dehydriding reaction  = 1.5 × 104 kJ/kg (appropriate for 
LaNi5). 
Note that Equation (2.4) does not involve the hydrogen permeation velocity. In 
fact, Equation (2.3) also can be substituted into Equation (2.1) to derive an equivalent 
continuity equation for gaseous hydrogen that does not involve the hydrogen 
permeation velocity: 
While the gaseous hydrogen density  is a function of pressure  and temperature 
—and so is —here the kinematic viscosity  =  is taken to be 
constant (which is a good approximation; see [84, Figure B.2] for example). Also, 
following Ben Nasrallah and Jemni [74], here we set  = 1 μm2. 
 
2.3 Dehydriding Kinetics Model 
We now discuss the dehydriding kinetics model used in the JBN model, which 
relates the hydrogen desorption rate  to the density  of the metal hydride 
powder, and the hydrogen pressure  and temperature . In the JBN model, the 
hydrogen desorption rate is given by [73] 
where  = 9.57 sec-1 is a reaction rate constant and  = 8240 kJ/kg is the 
(2.5)

For the reference equilibrium pressure  = 1.01 × 105 Pa (= 1 bar) and reference 
temperature  = 303 K, the values of the coefficients  are listed in Table 
2.1. Note that enough significant digits of  have to be retained in order for 
Equation (2.9) to give accurate values of . Also, as shown in Figure 2.2, the 
value of  generally increases with . However, when LaNi5 undergoes 
a phase change,  would vary between about 1.5 to 5, while  stays constant at 
about 2 bar. 
 
2.4 Initial and Boundary Conditions 
In our computations, the initial temperature and pressure in the MHR are set at 
 = 300 K and  = 707 kPa (= 7 bar), respectively. Suppose also that, before 
discharging, the gaseous hydrogen is in equilibrium with the metal hydride. The 
corresponding equilibrium pressure  therefore is 707 kPa as well. Using then 
Equations (2.7) and (2.9), it is readily calculated that the hydrogen-to-metal atomic 
ratio has an initial value of  = 5.7 throughout the MHR (indicated by the point 
 in Figure 2.2). Moreover, Equation (2.8) gives the initial density of the metal 
hydride powder  = 8.41 × 103 kg/m3 (for ∀  0 ≤  ≤ , 0 ≤  ≤ ). 
Recall that here the metal hydride powder in the MHR has a porosity of  = 0.5, its 
(2.9)
 28 
 
mass without hydrogen absorption is calculated accordingly to be  
= 977.82 g, while that with the initially stored hydrogen is  
= 990.78 g. The weight percentage of the hydrogen initially stored in the MHR 
therefore is about 1.32%. 
As for thermal boundary conditions, axisymmetry implies that 
at  = 0. On the side wall of the MHR, where  = , the convective heat transfer 
with the ambient fluid is taken into account, so that the thermal boundary condition 
there is written as 
In our computations, the ambient fluid temperature is taken to be  = 333 K. Also, 
using the value determined in the experiments of Jemni et al. [76], the heat transfer 
coefficient is chosen to be  = 1652 W/m2-K (see Table 2.1). The same thermal 
boundary condition is used for the bottom wall of the MHR, where  = 0, and so we 
have 
Finally, on the top surface, where  =  and hydrogen is released, we shall neglect 
the heat exchange there with the outside of the MHR, and set

where the parameter  =  is the normalized (dimensionless) 
initial drop rate of the MHR exit pressure. Note that, when the parameter  = 1, 
Equation (2.17) reduces to a linear function of time. Also, to ensure that the exit 
pressure is not lower than the atmospheric pressure, it is required that 0 <  < 2. In 
the next chapter, we shall discuss the numerical results of a systematic parameter 
study, and examine the effects of varying the parameters  and  on the hydrogen 
supply characteristics of the MHR (such as the temporal mean and steadiness of the 
hydrogen discharge rate). 
Note also that other temporally decreasing functions, such as the exponential 
function, also can be used for the MHR exit-pressure variation. However, it was found 
in a previous work [86] that the MHR performance is somewhat more sensitive to the 
pressure-drop time ( ) and the initial pressure drop rate ( ) than other 
characteristics of the exit-pressure profile. So, for conciseness, other exit-pressure 
profiles are not considered here.

Chapter 3 
Effects of Exit-Pressure Variation on Hydrogen 
Discharge Characteristics 
 
In this chapter, we shall use the numerical model described in the last chapter to 
examine the particular case in which the exit pressure is decreased quadratically 
within an adjustable “pressure-drop time” from a prescribed initial value to another 
prescribed final value. Also, before doing so, in §3.1 the JBN model is validated by 
comparing its numerical results with some experimental data in the literature.  
 
3.1 Model Validation 
In order to validate the JBN model outlined in Chapter 2, here we compare its 
numerical results with the experimental data of Laurencelle and Goyette [69]. Note, 
however, that some parameter values for their experiments differ from that specified 
in Table 2.1. In particular, the “small” MHR they used had a radius of 3.175 mm. (A 
“large” MHR, within which a metal foam was installed to enhance heat conduction, 
was also used in their experiments. But since the present model does not consider the 
presence of a metal foam, the experimental results for the large MHR will not be 
compared.) With the specified mass of 1 g and porosity of 0.55, it is estimated that the

line. 
 44 
 
we now proceed to examine how such characteristics are affected by varying the exit 
pressure of the MHR with time. In particular, the special case of  = 1 (i.e., linear 
temporal decrease of the exit pressure) is considered first. Note also that, in order for 
the exit pressure variation to affect the hydrogen discharge from the MHR, the 
pressure-drop time  has to be on the same order of magnitude as the 
heat-penetration time scale . As a specific example, let us take  = 2000 sec, 
and plot the corresponding temporal variations of the hydrogen discharge rate ( ) 
and hydrogen desorption percentage ( ) in Figure 3.4. In addition, the corresponding 
curves in Figure 3.2 (for  = 0) also are duplicated here for comparison. 
    It is clearly seen that, since the initial pressure drop in the present case is much 
slower than that for  = 0, the initial value of  ≈ 0.2 g/sec (indicated by a dot 
at the initial point of the  curve in Figure 3.4) is smaller than that for  = 0 
(  ≈ 22 g/sec) by a factor of about 100. Meanwhile, since the exit pressure is kept 
at 1 bar in the case of  = 0, and the amount of hydrogen in the MHR decreases 
with time, the driving force for hydrogen desorption diminishes as time progresses. 
As a result, the hydrogen discharge rate  for  = 0 decreases monotonically 
with time, by a factor of about 105 within 4000 sec (see Figure 3.4). By contrast, 
although the initial value of  for  = 2000 sec and  = 1 is smaller than that 
for  = 0, the continuous exit-pressure drop ascertains that there always is a small  
 46 
 
driving force for further hydrogen discharge. This then results in a time period within 
which  is approximately constant (but has some small-scale oscillations) in the 
present case (of  = 2000 sec and  = 1), as shown in Figure 3.4. After  = , 
however, the exit pressure in the present case again is kept constant at 1 bar, and so 
the driving force of hydrogen discharge begins to diminish in strength. The  
curve for the case of  = 2000 sec and  = 1 in Figure 3.4 therefore shows a 
similar trend with that for the case of  = 0. 
To quantify the hydrogen desorption characteristics of the MHR, we evaluate the 
time it takes for the MHR to discharge 90% of the hydrogen initially stored in the 
MHR, hereafter referred to as the “depletion time” and denoted by . Also, the 
variance of the hydrogen discharge rate ( ) during  is calculated as follows: 
where 
is the temporal mean of  during . Clearly,    =  . 
In Table 3.1, the depletion time , mean flow rate , and variance  of 
hydrogen discharge are listed for various pressure-drop times . As is intuitively 
clear, the depletion time  increases with . (And of course, the mean discharge 
rate  decreases with increasing .) It is also seen in Table 3.1 that the  
(3.1)
(3.2)
 48 
 
variance  of the hydrogen discharge rate decreases with increasing . This means 
that decreasing the exit pressure of the MHR at a slower rate would produce a more 
steady hydrogen discharge rate, which is an advantage. On the other hand, from a 
practical standpoint, the reduced average discharge rate  is a disadvantage 
(resulting from the reduced strength of the instantaneous driving force for hydrogen 
desorption). 
However, in more quantitative terms, compared with the case of sudden 
exit-pressure drop (i.e.,  = 0), when  = 4000 sec the depletion time  = 
6000 sec is about 60% longer, but the variance  of the hydrogen discharge rate is 
reduced by a factor of about 50. It is also interesting to note that, if a shorter 
pressure-drop time is chosen, say  = 500 sec, then  will only be increased by 
5%, while  is substantially reduced by a factor of 15. So, a proper  can be 
chosen to reduce the variance of the hydrogen discharge rate without much sacrifice 
of the depletion time. The idea of decreasing the exit pressure of an MHR therefore 
appears to be useful. 
 
3.4 Effects of Parameter  on MHR Performance  
Let us now proceed to examine the effects of varying the initial drop rate of the 
exit pressure (characterized by the dimensionless parameter ) on the performance of

listed in Table 3.4, together with the corresponding mean hydrogen discharge rate 
, minimum variance , and the ratios of  and  to  and , 
respectively. It is seen that, similar to the results produced by linear exit-pressure 
drops (with  = 1 and various ; see Table 3.1), a substantial reduction in the 
variance of the hydrogen discharge rate can be obtained without much sacrifice of the 
mean discharge rate. And of course, since the results presented in Table 3.4 are 
produced by the “optimal” choices of  (rather than an arbitrarily specified unity 
value), for a same exit-pressure drop time , the values of the mean hydrogen 
discharge rates in Table 3.4 are slightly higher than that in Table 3.1. Similarly, the 
minimum variances of the hydrogen discharge rate in Table 3.4 also are slightly lower 
than that in Table 3.1 for a same . It is worth noting here that, if a decision is 
made for the trade-off between the mean discharge rate  and variance  of the 
hydrogen discharge rate, Table 3.4 would suggest the proper choice of the 
pressure-drop time  and the corresponding variance minimizing value of the 
parameter . 
Meanwhile, in some applications, instead of minimizing  for a prescribed , 
it may be more desirable to maximize  while keeping  within a tolerable limit. 
To demonstrate how our numerical results can help identify the “optimal” 
exit-pressure variation when this is the case, suppose that the maximum  
 54 
 
tolerance of  is set (arbitrarily) at 2.5 mg/sec. Then, the results shown in Table 3.3 
suggest that the pressure-drop time  has to exceed 500 sec. While more accurate 
predictions of the minimum  that would produce a satisfactorily low  can be 
found by carrying out more computations, for demonstration purpose only let us 
simply proceed with the discussion based upon the numerical results presented in 
Table 3.3. Accordingly, one has to choose  = 1000 sec (the next larger  in 
Table 3.3). Moreover, the initial pressure-drop rate parameter  has to be smaller 
than 1.8 to produce a satisfactorily low value of . However, since the mean 
hydrogen discharge rate  generally increases with increasing  for a prescribed 
 (see Table 3.2), the “optimal” choice of  would be about 1.8. (Of course, such 
an optimal value can be refined by carrying out more computations.) This example 
should have clearly demonstrated that the numerical results of the present model 
would remain useful irrespective of optimization rules. 
 
3.5 Effects of Reactor Size and Heat Transfer on MHR Performance 
Here we shall examine how the MHR size (characterized by its radius  and 
height ) and heat transfer condition (characterized by the effective heat transfer 
coefficient ) affect its performance. For that purpose, the case of  = 0 (i.e., 
sudden exit-pressure drop) will be considered first. It will then transpire that, to

12.60 mg/sec, while that of sixteen R1-reactors in parallel is  = 29.28 
mg/sec. So, to supply a given amount of hydrogen at a higher mass flow rate, it 
appears desirable to use a few smaller MHRs connected in parallel, instead of a single 
larger MHR. Note also that the same conclusion can be reached from a comparison of 
Cases 0, H1, and H2 in Table 3.5 (which differ in MHR height  only). But of 
course, cost and space considerations sometimes may require one to use a single 
MHR at any rate. We will have more to add on this issue later. 
An intuitive interpretation can be given for the above finding. Specifically, it is 
clear that the internal thermal resistance of an MHR generally decreases with its size. 
As a result, the temperature in a smaller MHR would be more uniformly distributed, 
and hence closer to the higher ambient fluid temperature. The elevated internal 
temperature then promotes the dehydriding reaction taking place in the MHR, 
resulting in the increased mean hydrogen discharge rate per reactor volume (which 
can be calculated by dividing the value of  in Table 3.5 by the reactor volume). 
To provide some support for this conjecture, let us also compare Cases 0, h1, and h2 
in Table 3.5, which have the same reactor size but differing heat transfer coefficients. 
It is clearly seen that, as  decreases (i.e., the heat transfer condition becomes worse), 
the MHR depletion time  increases, and the mean hydrogen discharge rate  
decreases, consistent with the above conjecture. 
 60 
 
As pointed out above, despite that it appears to be advisable to use a few smaller 
MHRs connected in parallel, cost and space limitations sometimes may require one to 
use a single larger MHR having the same total hydrogen storage capacity. So, in the 
following discussion comparisons will be made for single reactors. The purpose is to 
examine how the effectiveness of exit pressure variation in reducing the hydrogen 
discharge rate variance is affected by the MHR size (i.e., its radius  and height ) 
and heat transfer condition (i.e., the effective heat transfer coefficient ). Recall also 
that the case of  = 500 sec is considered here for demonstration purposes, and that 
other choices of  generally would not alter our conclusion qualitatively. Now, an 
immediate observation for all cases listed in Table 3.5 is that, by decreasing the MHR 
exit pressure with time, the hydrogen discharge rate variance  is substantially 
reduced, so that  becomes much smaller than , while the mean discharge rate 
 is only slightly smaller than . As this observation is similar to that 
already discussed in §3.3 and §3.4, the same interpretation remains applicable here. 
More importantly, this suggests that, regardless of the MHR size and heat transfer 
condition, one can always use a properly designed exit-pressure variation to reduce 
the hydrogen discharge rate variance without much sacrifice in the mean discharge 
rate. In fact, as can also be deduced from the data listed in Table 3.5, for MHRs 
having a larger size or smaller heat transfer coefficient, the  ratio generally 
 62 
 
temporally decreasing exit pressure would be very effective. And of course, if 
possible, one may connect a number of smaller parallel MHRs in parallel, and use a 
temporally decreasing exit pressure simultaneously, to produce the highest possible 
total mean flow rate and lowest possible normalize variance of hydrogen discharge. 
 
3.6 Summary and Additional Remarks 
In this chapter, using the JBN model that accounts for the mass and energy 
balance and the hydrogen desorption kinetics in a cylindrical MHR, we have 
calculated the temporal mean and variance of the hydrogen discharge rate when the 
exit pressure of the MHR is deceased with time. By studying the limiting case of 
sudden exit-pressure drop first, we observed that the resulting hydrogen discharge rate 
 decreases almost instantaneously from its maximum value at  = 0 to a much 
lower value, and then continues to decrease at a much lower rate as time progresses. 
This is because the endothermic dehydriding reaction rapidly decreases the 
temperature in the MHR, and lowers the equilibrium pressure of the metal hydride at 
the same time. Consequently, the dehydriding reaction in the MHR effectively is put 
to a halt, and resumes only when the heat transferred from the outside of the MHR 
reaches its interior and raises the temperature there. It is verified numerically in §3.2 
that the characteristic time scale for the slower reaction in the MHR indeed is 
 64 
 
to discharge hydrogen at a maximum possible flow rate. Moreover, we have also 
demonstrated in §3.5 that, when the MHR exit pressure is decreased with time, the 
reduction in the variance of the hydrogen discharge rate generally is more substantial 
for MHRs having a larger size or poorer heat transfer condition, while the mean 
hydrogen discharge rate appears to be relatively insensitive to such factors.

taken into account. Specifically, in terms of  and the permeability  of plain 
metal hydride powder (i.e., that without metal foam), we have 
provided that the ligament diameter  of the metal foam is sufficiently large such 
that    1 [87]. With the values of the metal hydride powder diameter ( ) 
and porosity ( ) specified in Table 4.1, the value of  is estimated from the 
Kozeny–Carman equation[88] to be  =  = 4.1 μm2, while  
usually is greater than 76.2 μm in practice [81]; hence the use of Equation (4.4) is 
justified. 
 
4.2 Energy Balance 
In the experiments of Jemni et al. [76], it was verified that convective heat 
transfer and the local temperature difference between the hydrogen and metal hydride 
powder in an MHR generally can be neglected. Intuitively, when a small volume 
fraction of the MHR is occupied by a metal foam having a somewhat higher thermal 
conductivity than that of the metal hydride powder, the assumptions of negligible 
convective heat transfer and local thermal equilibrium would still be valid. In fact, 
such assumptions were made in the numerical simulations of Laurencelle and Goyette 
[69] and Mellouli et al. [80], and will be used here as well. Accordingly, for the

desorption rate is given by 
where  is a reaction rate constant, and  is the activation energy (with values 
specified in Table 4.1). Meanwhile,  is the mass density of the metal hydride 
powder with saturated hydrogen absorption (to be explained below). Moreover, the 
equilibrium pressure  is given by 
where  is the hydrogen-to-metal atomic ratio, i.e., the number of adsorbed 
hydrogen atoms per metal molecule. With the constant volume approximation 
explained in §4.1, one has 
The function  will be specified below. In [72], the enthalpy difference  
associated with the hydrogen phase change is related to the ideal gas constant for 
hydrogen, , by  = −3594 K. 
Now, for LaNi5,  is a polynomial function obtained by fitting 
experimental data [85]:

central difference formulas are used to discretize the spatial derivatives of the state 
variables of the system, while first-order implicit difference formulas are used to 
discretize the temporal derivatives. As for the numerical solution procedure, which is 
shown in Figure 4.3 graphically, the initial metal-hydride density ( ), hydrogen 
pressure ( ) and temperature ( ) distributions (or that at the current time step) are 
used as a first estimate for that at the next time step. Based upon such an estimate, and 
the equilibrium pressure ( ) distribution calculated accordingly by use of Equations 
(4.7), (4.8) and (4.9), Equations (4.1) and (4.6) then give the corresponding 
distributions of the local hydrogen desorption rate  and updated metal-hydride 
density  at the next time step. Moreover, with the estimated  distribution, the 
discretized versions of Equations (4.3) and (4.5) are solved to update the pressure and 
temperature distributions at the next time step. The procedures then are repeated until 
the metal-hydride density, hydrogen pressure and temperature distributions converge. 
In our computations, uniform grid points are deployed in the interior of the MHR, 
with 50 points in the -direction (  = 50). The time step is taken to be 0.1 sec (  = 
0.1 sec) so that the fastest variation of the system state in the MHR can be well 
resolved. When the relative variations of all state variables between two consecutive 
time steps are less than 10−8 times their current values at all points in the 
computational domain, the solution is taken to be converged. As shown in Figure 4.4,

we took an MHR of outer radius  = 5 cm and inner radius  = 2 cm for example, 
the values of temperature and hydrogen-to-metal atomic ratio were computed at 
intermediate location in the -direction (  = 3.5 cm) of the MHR. By comparing the 
results shown in Figure 4.4 corresponding to different computational grid and

criterion specified above produce grid-independent numerical results.

5.1 Model Validation 
In order to validate the mathematical model outlined in Chapter 4, here we 
compare its numerical results with the experimental data of Laurencelle and Goyette 
[69]. Note, however, that some parameter values for their experiments differ from that 
specified in Table 4.1, and therefore are detailed below. Specifically, in their 
experiments two MHRs were tested. A metal foam having a volume fraction of  
= 0.09 was installed in the “large reactor” of radius  = 6.350 mm to enhance heat 
conduction, but not in the “small reactor” with  = 3.175 mm. Note that, since the 
metal foam filled up the whole internal volume of the large reactor in the experiments 
of Laurencelle and Goyette [69], its apparent outer diameter also was the internal 
diameter of the reactor, and its apparent inner diameter  = 0. Moreover, the large 
and small reactors were charged at  = 12.73 bar and 5.96 bar, respectively, while 
the ambient fluid (air) temperature was set at  = 298 K. Note also that the initial 
MHR temperature and pressure were not explicitly specified in [69], and in our 
computations the reasonably estimated values of  =  and  = 0.1 bar are 
chosen for both reactors. 
(5.5)

paper) are reproduced in Figures 5.1(a) and 5.1(b), respectively. (No error bars were 
included in the original figures, and therefore cannot be shown here.) It is seen in both 
figures that, with a properly tuned effective heat transfer coefficient of  = 500 
W/m2-K, the numerical results of the present model agree reasonably well with the 
experimental data. Of course, here the heat transfer coefficient has a somewhat lower 
value than that specified in Table 4.1 (1652 W/m2-K). This can be understood on 
physical grounds. Specifically, the higher value specified in Table 4.1 is a reasonable 
estimate when the MHR is heated in a water bath [76]. However, in the experiments 
of Laurencelle and Goyette [69], the MHR was heated in an oven through an air layer, 
and so the effective heat transfer coefficient would have a lower value. This also 
suggests that, as the heat transfer coefficient is readily tunable, variations in MHR 
heating condition would not be a threat for the applicability of the present model. 
An additional interesting observation can be made by comparing the charging 
times (or, hydriding times) of the two reactors. Specifically, while the large reactor 
has a larger hydrogen storage capacity than that of the small reactor (as calculated 
above), the charging time of the large reactor is about 2.5 minutes [see Figure 5.1(b)], 
which is much shorter than the charging time of about 7.5 minutes [see Figure 5.1(a)] 
of the small reactor. Of course, this substantial reduction in hydrogen charging time 
results from the enhanced heat conduction in the large reactor by use of the metal  
 86 
 
foam. However, as is intuitively clear, the presence of the metal foam to some extent 
would reduce the interior space available for the metal hydride powder that can 
absorb hydrogen. So, in the following sections, we shall carefully examine this effect 
(using the parameter values specified in Table 4.1), and see if the MHR and metal 
foam parameters can be optimized in certain ways. 
 
5.2 MHR Charging Time for a Specified Amount of Metal Hydride 
First, suppose that a prescribed amount of metal hydride powder is sealed in an 
MHR of fixed internal diameter (  = 5 cm). A metal foam will also be installed in 
the MHR, with its volume fraction  being the design parameter, and here we 
wish to examine how the hydrogen charging time of the MHR depends on  
(Recall that the porosity of the metal foam is 1 - ). It should be noted, however, 
that as  varies, the MHR internal space available for the metal hydride powder 
and hydrogen would vary accordingly. In order to accommodate the prescribed 
amount of metal hydride powder, the apparent inner radius of the metal foam, , 
would have to vary as well. Specifically, assuming that the porosity  of the metal 
hydride powder is independent of , for a given  the apparent inner radius of 
the metal foam is calculated from Equation (5.1) to be 
 88

(b)

 90 
 
 from that with  = 0 (i.e., without metal foam) by a factor of about six. For 
smaller values of  (say, 170 g/cm), which allow for larger values of , the 
hydrogen charging time can even be reduced by a factor of about forty! Of course, the 
substantial reduction in  results from the heat conduction augmentation by use of 
the metal foam. 
A somewhat more interesting use of the data presented in Figure 5.2(a) is 
explained as follows. Suppose that a certain space is allocated for an MHR to be 
installed on a hydrogen power system. The reactor radius  then is determined (say, 
at 5 cm as specified here). To seal in the MHR an amount of metal hydride powder 
that is close to the maximum admissible amount (  = 293.7 g/cm), say  = 
290 g/cm, it would take about 570 min to charge the MHR to 95% of its full capacity, 
as indicated by point “ ” in Figure 5.2(a). One way to reduce the charging time of the 
MHR is to sacrifice its hydrogen storage capacity to some extent, and seal less metal 
hydride powder in it. As an example, suppose that only  = 170 g/cm of metal 
hydride powder is sealed in the MHR, as indicated by point “ ” in Figure 5.2(a). 
Accordingly, the hydrogen charging time ( ) would be reduced to about 144 min. 
But then a significant internal space (about 40%) of the MHR would be wasted, and 
there is a better alternative for reducing . Specifically, without reducing the 
metal-hydride mass , one may install a metal foam of suitable volume fraction

matters here we consider steady heat conduction with uniform heat generation in the 
MHR. Accordingly, the temperature distribution in the MHR can be calculated from 
 +  = 0 [cf. Equation (4.5)], with  being the rate of 
heat generation per unit volume. Using also Equation (4.10), it can be readily 
calculated that the difference between the MHR interior temperature at  and the 
ambient fluid temperature  −  = , where the “thermal resistance”  
The definition of thermal resistance used here is different from general thermal 
resistance for conduction  and the relationship between  and  are 
. For the same parameter ranges as that shown in Figure 5.2(a), 
the thermal resistances  calculated from Equation (5.7) are plotted against  
in Figure 5.2(b). 
It is clearly seen that the curves in Figure 5.2(b) are highly correlated to the 
corresponding curves in Figure 5.2(a). In particular, for a given , the minimum of 
 occurs at a particular  value that is close to the maximum admissible value 
of  (corresponding to zero apparent inner radius of the metal foam,  = 0). 
The corresponding  curves in Figure 5.2(a) exhibit a similar trend, and so the 
interpretation given above for the existence of a minimum MHR charging time for a 
given  is justified.

the MHR, the apparent inner radius  of the metal foam also should exceed a 
certain minimum value. In view of these practical considerations, here we fix  at 2 
cm in our computations. Also, the time it takes for the MHR to reach the capacity of 
 is taken to be the hydrogen charging time . [Consistent with this definition, 
the charging time  for a given  defined in §5.2 is that for  = 0.95 ·  · 
.] 
First let us examine how  varies with  for various values of ; see 
Figure 5.3(a). To understand the basic trend of the curves there, note that for given 
 the amount of metal hydride powder sealed in the MHR, , is a function of the 
metal-foam volume fraction ; see Equation (5.1). Also, for a given  (and 
), it is impossible for  to exceed the corresponding maximum hydrogen 
storage capacity of the MHR, , which can be calculated from Equation (5.3). 
Accordingly, as is clearly seen in Figure 5.3(a), for each value of  there is an 
upper limit for . Of course, the truly maximum hydrogen storage capacity of the 
MHR is obtained when  = 0, with  = 3.14 g/cm for the present 
parameter setting. The specified values of  therefore could not exceed such a 
value. Also, here we do not choose  below one half of this maximum capacity, 
because in such cases the hydrogen storage capacity of the MHR clearly is highly 
under-exploited.

increase in  of similar magnitude, it suffices to move  slightly below its 
maximum admissible value to reach  for larger values of  (which have 
smaller maximum admissible values of ), while a more significant decrease in 
 would be necessary for smaller values of . This interpretation is consistent 
with the dependence of the  ratio on  observed in Table 5.1. 
The variations of the hydrogen-to-metal weight percentage, , with  for 
the same  values used in Figure 5.3(a) are plotted in Figure 5.3(c). It is seen that,

 increases, more and more of the lighter metal-foam material (aluminum here) 
replaces the heavier metal hydride powder (LaNi5) in the MHR of fixed internal 
volume. Meanwhile, as explained above, for a given  there exists a maximum 
admissible value of the metal-foam volume fraction , which gives the 
corresponding maximum , . In Figure 5.3(c),  is plotted

optimal value of  is closer to its maximum admissible value when the specified 
value of  is larger.

5.4 Summary and Additional Remarks 
In this chapter, using a 1-D modified theoretical model that accounts for the mass 
and energy balance and the hydrogen absorption kinetics in a cylindrical MHR, we 
have examined how the charging time ( ) and hydrogen-to-metal weight percentage 
( ) of an MHR are affected by the volume fraction ( ) of a metal foam 
installed in the MHR to enhance heat conduction. After validating the theoretical 
model by comparing its numerical results with existing experimental data, two cases 
were studied numerically. First, in §5.2, the amount of metal hydride powder 
contained in the MHR (  per unit reactor height) was specified, and it was found 
that the metal foam’s presence indeed can substantially reduce the time ( ) required 
to charge the MHR to 95% of its maximum hydrogen storage capacity, with relatively 
insignificant reduction in . It was also shown that the effective thermal 
resistance of the MHR, , is highly correlated with the hydrogen charging time of 
the MHR. Moreover, for a given  there exists a particular  value that would 
minimize , which is rather close to the value of  that minimizes . A 
specific example also was discussed in §5.2 to demonstrate how the numerical results 
of the present model can be used to help identify the design parameters of the MHR 
and metal foam that would meet the specified hydrogen storage capacity and charging 
time of the MHR. 
 104 
 
of installing a suitably designed metal foam in an MHR to minimize its hydrogen 
charging time, without necessarily sacrificing its hydrogen storage capacity. Also, the 
theoretical model and the computational and analysis methodologies proposed in this 
work are useful for providing important insights into the optimization of MHR and 
metal-foam parameter design.

always is a small and steady driving force for further hydrogen discharge. 
3. For a fixed exit-pressure drop rate , it is found that increasing the exit-pressure 
drop time  would produce a more steady hydrogen discharge rate, but reduce 
average discharge rate  at the same time. On the other hand, for a fixed , 
we can optimize the exit-pressure variation by finding the specific  so that the 
variance of the hydrogen discharging rate is minimized. 
4. To supply a prescribed total amount of hydrogen at a higher and more steady mass 
flow rate, one may use a few smaller MHRs connected in parallel, instead of a 
single larger MHR storing the same total amount of hydrogen. 
5. MHRs having a smaller size and/or better heat transfer condition would supply 
hydrogen at a more steady rate, and the total mean hydrogen discharge rate would 
also be higher. 
6. When the MHR exit pressure is decreased with time, the reduction in the variance 
of the hydrogen discharge rate generally is more substantial for MHRs having a 
larger size or poorer heat transfer condition, while the mean hydrogen discharge 
rate appears to be relatively insensitive to such factors. 
7. Regardless of the MHR size and heat transfer condition, one can always use a 
properly designed exit-pressure variation to reduce the hydrogen discharge rate 
variance without much sacrifice in the mean discharge rate.

and the thermal resistance of the MHR. 
3. With different definition of charging time, we find the charging time  would 
decrease with increasing  due to heat conduction augmentation for smaller 
, but  would increase dramatically with increasing  due to saturation 
effect for larger . There therefore exists an “optimal” value of  for a 
given storage capacity of hydrogen , which minimizes the hydrogen charging 
time . 
4. For a specified , the weight percentage  increases with increasing  
because that as  increases, more and more of the lighter metal-foam material 
(aluminum here) replaces the heavier metal hydride powder (LaNi5) in the MHR 
of fixed internal volume. 
Through the above-mentioned observations, we have seen the effectiveness of 
installing a suitably designed metal foam in an MHR to minimize its hydrogen 
charging time, without necessarily sacrificing its hydrogen storage capacity.  
 
6.3 General Guidelines for MHR Design 
    In this report, through a systematic analysis of the results, we found that the 
hydriding/dehydriding characteristics of an MHR were affected by its design 
parameters, such as MHR size, heat transfer conditions and operating pressure. When

6.5 Self-Evaluation of Project Accomplishment:  
This project report has been based upon the doctoral dissertation of Dr. 
Meng-Lung Tsai [90], who earned his PhD degree in 2011 at the National Cheng 
Kung University (NCKU).  To fulfill the degree requirements, the thesis work of Dr. 
Tsai also was published in two papers [52, 91] in the International Journal of 
Hydrogen Energy, which is one of the most prestigious and widely circulated journals 
on hydrogen energy research.  Meanwhile, during his residence at NCKU, Dr. Tsai 
also helped supervise a Master’s thesis [86], and coauthored a number of conference 
papers.   
All the aforementioned publications have been produced directly or indirectly in 
this project, and thus strongly certify that this project has been successfully carried out.  
Moreover, the success of the project not only helps deepen our understanding of the 
thermofluid processes in metal-hydride reactors, but also provides us with invaluable 
research experience in this exciting area.  In fact, on the basis of the experience, 
several research efforts have been planned (and some are actively ongoing), in order 
to further understand the important issue of metal-hydride reactor design optimization.  
So, we are confident to conclude that this project not only has been completed, it also 
opens up several important and interesting research directions for us to follow in the 
years to come.
