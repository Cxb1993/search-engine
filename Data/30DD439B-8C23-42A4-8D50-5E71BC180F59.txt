Partial volume effect for in vivo proton MRS 
has been studied for a long time, yet most of 
them were focused on the correction of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [3].  As the interest 
of absolute quantification using LCModel [4] 
has been arising, the accuracy of quantitative 
concentrations has been also studied, in which 
partial volume correction plays an important 
role to compensate the heterogeneity, e.g. gray 
matter (GM) or white matter (WM) within 
voxel [5].  On the other hand, LCModel 
provides two approaches for absolute 
quantification: water scaling and calibration 
phantom.  The usage of calibration phantom 
to calibrates metabolite concentrations is 
considered more accurate and reliable but only 
applicable to the acquisition with standard 
quadrature head coils.  Spectra acquired by 
phased array coil, which is getting more 
popular nowadays, can only be analyzed using 
water scaling method with LCModel.  The 
precise quantification relies on the water 
scaling factor: WCONC, by assuming known 
water concentration.  Thus, partial volume 
correction of spectra may also allow the 
detection of subtle abnormalities in brain 
metabolism; information on the amount of gray 
and white matter in each voxel allows for 
analysis of which tissue type is more severely 
affected, while prior knowledge about 
metabolite concentrations in normal white and 
gray matter can be included to estimate the 
probability that each spectrum is abnormal [6].  
Accurate tissue segmentation into gray matter, 
white matter, and CSF is important for 
quantification of metabolites in brain [6]. 
 
 
四、研究方法 
 
Experiments were performed on a 1.5T system 
(General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) using 
standard quadrature birdcage head coil. Four 
healthy volunteers (1 female and 3 male, 
23.5±0.5 y/o) were included in this study.  
Routine 3D T1 protocol was performed for 
voxel localization of MRS as well as 
segmentation process afterwards.  Three 
single voxel (SV) MR spectra located at 
temporal lobe were acquired using short TE 
PRESS sequence (TR/TE/ave = 
1600ms/35ms/128, voxel size = 
20x20x20mm3). Each of these spectra had 
different WM/GM ratio according to the spatial 
location. Segmentation process to the whole 
brain was applied to the 3D T1 MR images 
using algorithm proposed by Herndon et al [1], 
yet some parameters have been modified in 
order to fit our image characteristics.  Ratios 
of WM/GM within the voxel were 
subsequently calculated, which accounted for 
the control parameter of LCModel, ‘WCONC’, 
by the definition: [WCONCcorr = 35880x(WM%) 
+ 43300x(GM%)].  Two uncorrected values 
of WCONC (WCONCWM=35880, 
WCONCGM=43300) were also included for 
comparison. A total number of 12 SV spectra 
from four normal volunteers were analyzed.  
 
Metabolite concentrations (mM) were 
measured by LCModel using water scaling 
method with three WCONC defined the above 
(WCONCcorr, WCONCWM, WCONCGM), 
yielding three values of concentrations for 
identical voxel.  Concentrations of total NAA 
(tNAA, NAA+NAAG) were used to evaluate 
the degree of over/under-estimation.  Errors 
caused by the uncorrected water scaling factor 
were thus defined as: Error(%) = 
|([tNAAWM.GM]-[tNAAcorr])/[tNAAcorr] |x100% 
where [tNAAWM, GM] and [tNAAcorr] represent 
the concentrations obtained using three water 
scaling factors: WCONCWM , WCONCGM  as 
well as WCONCcorr  respectively. 
 
As for the implementation of the web-tool for 
analyzing MRS data with LCmodel, all scripts 
of the website were programmed in Expect, 
CSS, PHP, C++, JavaScript and HTML.  The 
 4 
more accurate absolute concentrations can be 
obtained.  Even though we applied SV spectra 
to illustrate the significance of partial volume 
correction, we believe that this study will 
contribute MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) 
more since the partial volume effect is more 
noticeable in that case [5].  With the 
enrollment of segmentation procedure, the 
accuracy of absolute concentrations of either 
SV or MRSI data quantified by LCModel can 
be improved and benefit the further 
investigation of MRS in clinical applications. 
 
 
六、計畫成果自評 
 
Our result regarding the web-tool of MRS data 
analysis with LCModel has been accepted and 
presented as poster at the 16th ISMRM in 
Toronto, CANADA.  And this tool has drawn 
attention from many international research 
institutes.  We shall continue developing and 
extending of the functionalities of this tool.  
The publication of this study is in preparation 
and will be submitted soon.   
 
The partial volume correction algorithm has 
been validated and is applied to some clinical 
application in some clinical site, e.g. Kaohsiung 
Veterans General Hospital. The importance of 
this technique has been recognized.   
 
The achievement of this project is very 
valuable and plays an important role for further 
investigation of MRS studies.  As the more 
newly developed techniques of MRS 
acquisition have been proposed, the more 
precise and reliable absolute quantification 
issues need to be investigated.
