英文摘要: All of our research results for the third year (2009/8/1~2010/7/31) are highly innovative cutting 
edge research contributions on advanced blind source separation (BSS) methods for both biomedical and 
hyperspectral image analysis and multiuser communications, including separation criterion design, algorithm 
development, and identifiability analysis. For biomedical and hyperspectral image analysis where the sources 
are usually statistically correlated, based on convex analysis and optimization theory, we have developed 
effective BSS algorithms without involving any source statistical assumption, and also devised their robust 
extensions to account for the presence of noise in the observations. For multiuser communications, we have 
developed a Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace approach by utilizing the local second-order statistics (SOSs) of 
quasi-stationary signals for estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) (applicable to the underdetermined 
systems) and blind channel identification. These research results partly have been published by IEEE Trans. 
Signal Processing and a book chapter (Cambridge University Press) or have been submitted to IEEE 
Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing – Special Issue on Spectral Unmixing of Remotely Sensed 
Data (under review), and partly have been presented at or submitted to major flagship international 
conferences.

analysis, the BSS methods developed for hyperspectral image analysis can also be applied to biomedical 
image analysis. Figure 2 illustrates conceptually that the hyperspectral sensor receives the electromagnetic 
(EM) scattering patterns reflected from the Earth surface, and that hyperspectral unmixing decomposes the 
measured image cube into the spectra of materials (or endmember signatures, i.e., spectral signatures of water, 
tree and land) and the associated mixing proportions (or abundance maps, i.e., distributions of different 
materials (water, tree and land)). The extracted endmember signatures and abundance maps can be used to 
identify what the materials are and how they are distributed in the scanned surface.

programming. In addition, we have also applied the chance constrained reformulation to alternating volume 
maximization (AVMAX) algorithm [8] (see Research Results in the First Two Years (2007/8/1~2009/7/31) at 
the end of this section) (based on the volume maximization of the simplex constructed by the extracted 
endmembers) for endmember extraction to mitigate the effect of noise, and the resultant robust AVMAX 
algorithm is implemented by second-order-cone programming (see #6 below). Furthermore, we have provided 
a convex optimization perspective to simplex volume maximization problem. Specifically, we have proved 
the endmember identifiability of the simplex volume maximization criterion, proposed two novel algorithms 
including their convergence analysis, and developed another robust extension of AVMAX using worst-case 
optimization (see #7 below). Since the amount of hyperspectral data may be quite large in practical 
applications, we proposed two effective and computationally efficient endmember extraction algorithms 
called simplex estimation by projection (SIMPLE-Pro) algorithm and p-norm based pure pixel identification 
(TRI-P) algorithm along with their endmember identifiability (see # 8 below).  
For direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of quasi-stationary signals in microphone array systems, we 
have developed a Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace approach by utilizing the local second-order statistics (SOSs) of 
quasi-stationary signals. It has been proven that the DOA identifiability still holds even when the number of 
sensors is about half of the number of sources, and the KR formulation provides a simple yet effective way of 
eliminating the unknown spatial noise covariance from the signal SOSs (see #9 below). Moreover, we have 
considered a more challenging case of blind channel identification where the channel matrix does not exhibit 
array response structure. We have proposed a channel column identification method using alternating 
projections (AP), and proved that in the absence of statistical modeling errors (due to finite-sample effects), 
the AP method (with prewhitening) almost surely converges to a true channel column in one iteration. A 
method that uses AP to effectively identify all the channel columns is also developed (see #10 below).

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in blind separation of non-negative sources, as 
simply non-negative blind source separation (nBSS). Potential applications of nBSS include biomedical 
imaging, multi/hyper-spectral imaging, and analytical chemistry. In this chapter, we describe a rather new 
endeavor of nBSS, where convex geometry is utilized to analyze the nBSS problem. Called convex analysis 
of mixtures of non-negative sources (CAMNS), the framework described here makes use of a very special 
assumption called local dominance, which is a reasonable assumption for source signals exhibiting sparsity or 
high contrast. Under the local dominant and some general nBSS assumptions, we show that the source signals 
can be perfectly identified by finding the extreme points of an observation-constructed polyhedral set. Two 
methods for practically locating the extreme points are also derived. One is analysis-based with some 
appealing theoretical guarantees, while the other is heuristic in comparison but is intuitively expected to 
provide better robustness against model mismatches. Both are based on linear programming and thus can be 
effectively implemented. Simulation results on several data sets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of 
9 
 
programming (SQP) solvers in an alternating fashion. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to demonstrate 
the efficacy of the proposed RMVES algorithm over several existing benchmark hyperspectral unmixing 
methods, including the original MVES algorithm.

Abstract: Effective unmixing of hyperspectral data cube under a noisy scenario has been a challenging 
research problem in remote sensing arena. A branch of existing hyperspectral unmixing algorithms is based 
on Craig’s criterion, which states that the vertices of the minimum volume simplex enclosing the 
hyperspectral data should yield high fidelity estimates of the endmember signatures associated with the data 
cloud. Recently, we have developed a minimum volume enclosing simplex (MVES) algorithm based on 
Craig’s criterion and validated that the MVES algorithm is very useful to unmix highly mixed hyperspectral 
data. However, the presence of noise in the observations expands the actual data cloud and as a consequence 
the endmember estimates obtained by applying the MVES algorithm to the noisy data may no longer be in 
close proximity to the true endmember signatures. In this work, we propose a robust minimum volume 
enclosing simplex (RMVES) algorithm that accounts for the noise effects in the observations by employing 
chance constraints. These chance constraints in turn control the volume of the resulting simplex. Under the 
Gaussian noise assumption, the chance constrained minimum volume enclosing simplex problem can be 
formulated into a deterministic non-linear program. The problem can then be conveniently handled by 
alternating optimization, in which each subproblem involved is handled by using sequential quadratic 
programming solvers. The proposed RMVES is compared with several existing benchmark algorithms 
including its predecessor, the MVES algorithm. Monte-Carlo simulations and real hyperspectral data 
experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed RMVES algorithm.

framework for hyperspectral endmember extraction,” submitted to IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote 
Sensing – Special Issue on Spectral Unmixing of Remotely Sensed Data, Sept. 2010.  
 
Abstract: In hyperspectral remote sensing, the spectra of materials (or endmember signatures) enable 
identification of the materials that make up a scanned scene of interest. However, the limited spatial resolution 
of the sensors usually makes each pixel spectrum a mixture of endmember signatures. The procedure of 
recovering the endmember signatures from the hyperspectral data is called endmember extraction. In the late 
90's, Winter proposed an endmember extraction belief, which states that the ground truth endmembers may be 
found by locating a collection of pixel vectors whose simplex volume is the maximum. Winter's belief has 
stimulated much attention, resulting in many different variations of Winter-based pixel search algorithms, 
widely known as N-FINDR, being proposed. In this work, we take on a continuous optimization perspective 
to revisit Winter's belief, where the aim is to provide an alternative framework of formulating and 
understanding Winter's belief in a systematic manner. We first prove that fundamentally, the existence of pure 
pixels is not only sufficient for the Winter problem to perfectly identify the ground truth endmembers, but 
also necessary. Then, under the umbrella of the Winter problem, we derive two endmember extraction 
methods using two different optimization methodologies. One is based on alternating optimization. The 
outcome turns out to be an N-FINDR variant, but the proposed formulation enables us to pin down some of its 
convergence characteristics. Another is based on successive optimization; coincidently it is found to be 
strikingly similar to the vertex component analysis (VCA) algorithm. The endmember identifiability of the 
two proposed methods is also proven. Furthermore, we propose a robust worst-case generalization of the 
Winter problem for accounting for the perturbed pixel effects in the noisy scenario. An algorithm combining 
alternating optimization and projected subgradients is devised to deal with the problem. Some simulation 
results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.

computationally efficient pure-pixel based algorithms for hyperspectral endmember extraction,” submitted to

Abstract: Endmember extraction is of prime importance in the process of hyperspectral unmixing so as to 
study the mineral composition of a landscape from its hyperspectral observations. Though, a whole bunch of 
pure-pixel based endmember extraction algorithms exists, the quest for a reliable, repeatable, and 
computationally efficient endmember extraction algorithm still prevails. In this work, we propose two 
pure-pixel based endmember extraction algorithms called simplex estimation by projection (SIMPLE-Pro)

handling those per-channel-column problems. Interestingly, we prove that under an ideal model condition, the 
proposed AP algorithm converges to a true channel column almost surely, and it does so within one iteration. 
Our simulation results show that the proposed method terminates in 3-4 iterations on average when noise is 
present, and that it achieves satisfactory channel estimation performance as compared to some other existing 
BCI-QSS methods.

Abstract: This dissertation deals with the topic of non-negative blind source separation (nBSS), a 
widely-applicable technique in many real-world applications, such as multichannel biomedical image analysis 
and hyperspectral image analysis. Fundamentally, unlike the skills involved in relevant existing frameworks, 
such as non-negative extension of independent component analysis (ICA) and non-negative matrix 
factorization (NMF), we exploit convex geometry to develop two nBSS frameworks without any source 
statistical independence/uncorrelatedness assumption. The first framework called convex analysis of mixtures 
of non-negative sources (CAMNS) makes use of an insightful and practical model assumption (called source 
local dominance) to connect nBSS and convex geometry. It leads to a deterministic, convex analysis based 
nBSS criterion that boils down nBSS problem to the problem of finding all the extreme points of an 
observation-constructed polyhedral set (or an extreme point enumeration problem). We derive two linear 
programming based methods for efficiently locating the extreme points. One is analytically based and 
provides some appealing theoretical guarantees, while the other is heuristic but provides better robustness 
when model assumptions are not perfectly satisfied. Simulation results for several data sets are presented to 
demonstrate the efficacy of the CAMNS-based methods over several existing benchmark nBSS methods. In 
addition, experimental results with real biomedical images are presented to evaluate the high practical 
applicability of CAMNS. 
    In hyperspectral remote sensing, unmixing a data cube into the spectral signatures (or endmenbers) and 
their corresponding mixing proportion (or abundance fractions) plays a crucial role in analyzing the 
mineralogical composition of a solid surface. Such an unmixing problem nature has a lot in common with 
nBSS problem. The second framework describes a new convex analysis and optimization perspective to 
hyperspectral unmixing. By the notion of convex analysis, we formulate two optimization problems for 
hyperspectral unmixing, which have intuitive ideas (or beliefs without any rigorous analysis and proof) that 
“the endmembers are determined by vertices of the maximum volume simplex within all the observed pixels” 
proposed by Winter in late 1990, and that “the endmembers are determined by the vertices of a minimum

unique decomposition can also be found in [20].
The nBSS based on the pure-source sample assumption
(where a pure-source sample means a data point that is fully
dominated by only one source) has been investigated for
separation of dependent sources in biomedical imaging [21],
[22], [23] and remote sensing applications [24], [25], [26]. In
[27], a neural network algorithm, searching for the edges of
data scatter plot, exploits the existence of pure-source
samples to iteratively update the unmixing matrix such that
the sum of all the off-diagonal entries of the angular
proximity matrix (analogous to the cross-correlation matrix)
of the extracted edges is minimum. A recently reported
nBSS method, convex analysis of mixtures of nonnegative
sources (CAMNS) [22], based on the pure-source sample
assumption, has been theoretically proven to achieve perfect
separation by searching for all the extreme points of an
observation-constructed polyhedral set. In remote sensing,
many spectral unmixing algorithms [24], [25], [26], also
based on the pure-source sample assumption, try to search
for the purest observed pixels from the spectral data set and
then identify the mixing matrix. The use of such spectral
unmixing methods is usually followed by an inversion
process, such as nonnegative least-squares method, to
recover the sources. Similar ideas for finding the mixing
matrix can be found in our recently reported nBSS method,
namely nLCA [23], which estimates the mixing matrix by an
algebraic edge search algorithm. Herein, we renamed the
nLCA reported in [23] nLCA-edge search (nLCA-ES) so as to
distinguish it from the one to be presented in this paper.
In this paper, we propose a joint correlation function of
multiple signals for the design of the demixing matrix. The
joint correlation function of the observations mixed by
nonnegative combinations of the sources would be higher
than that of the sources. Based on this idea and the
nonnegativity constraint of the sources, a novel nLCA is
proposed for which the nBSS problem is formulated into a
problem of minimizing the joint correlation function of all
the demixed sources under the nonnegativity constraint. A
closed-form solution for the case of two sources with two
observations is provided. For the general case of multiple
sources, the proposed nLCA can be fulfilled by an iterative
volume maximization algorithm (nLCA-IVM) using linear
program (LP), which finds the optimal demixing matrix by
maximizing the volume of a solid region formed by the
demixed source vectors regardless of whether the pure-
source sample assumption is valid or not. However, the
source identifiability of the nLCA can be proven under the
existence of pure-source samples. In contrast to other
spectral unmixing methods, the proposed nLCA-IVM,
which is never a pure-source sample criterion-based nBSS
algorithm, is able to separate all the (dependent or
independent) sources from the given mixtures without
involving any inversion process. Comparative experimental
results using synthetic data and real biomedical data are
presented to demonstrate the superior performance of
nLCA-IVM over several existing benchmark methods.
Section 2 presents the nBSS problem formulation and
the model assumptions. In Section 3, the novel nLCA is
presented followed by the closed-form solution of the
optimum demixing matrix for the two-source case, the
nLCA-IVM algorithm, and the source identifiability of the
nLCA under the existence of pure-source samples. For
real-world applications, where the number of mixtures is
larger than the number of sources, Section 4 presents noise
reduction and rank reduction prior to the nBSS processing
using the nLCA-IVM algorithm. In Section 5, simulation
results are presented with synthetic mixed human face
images, infrared spectral signals, and dual-energy X-ray
images to evaluate the performance of the proposed
nLCA-IVM algorithm. Then a real data analysis of
fluorescence microscopy imaging and that of dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)
using the proposed nLCA-IVM algorithm are presented to
show its effectiveness. Finally, some conclusions are drawn
in Section 6.

value of corrðx1; x2Þ, the smaller the area of solfx1; x2g. Since
the distance from the origin to the hyperplane passing
through x1 and x2 (i.e., affðx1; x2Þ) is fixed, the smaller the
area of solfx1; x2g, the smaller the value of ðx1; x2Þ. Hence,

which is a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem,
implying that finding a closed-form solution of (13) for any
M and N is almost formidable.
Next, let us present how to solve (13) for the case of
M ¼ N ¼ 2 and the case of M ¼ N  2, respectively,
followed by the associated source identifiability.
3.1 Case of M ¼ N ¼ 2: Closed-Form Solution
Although problem (13) is a nonconvex problem, fortunately
we can find a closed-form solution for the case of
M ¼ N ¼ 2, as stated in the following proposition:
Proposition 1. Under (A1) to (A4), problem (13) for M ¼
N ¼ 2 has the closed-form solution W?, where

; ð14bÞ
w?12 ¼ 1 w?11; w?22 ¼ 1 w?21: ð14cÞ
Proof. By (11), (12), and M ¼ N ¼ 2,
yi ¼ wi1x1 þ wi2x2 ¼ wi1ðx1  x2Þ þ x2; i ¼ 1; 2: ð15Þ
Thus, maximizing V ðsolfy1; y2gÞ (i.e., the shaded area in
Fig. 2) is equivalent to increasing jw11j and jw21j, where
w11 	 0 and w21  0. Therefore, problem (13) can be
decomposed into the following two subproblems:
w?11 ¼ minw w
s:t: w 	 0; wðx1  x2Þ þ x2  0;
ð16aÞ
w?21 ¼ maxw w
s:t: w  0; wðx1  x2Þ þ x2  0:
ð16bÞ
Note that the inequality wðx1  x2Þ þ x2  0 is equiva-
lent to wðx1½n  x2½nÞ þ x2½n  0 for n ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; L.
Therefore, the constraintwðx1  x2Þ þ x2  0 itself implies
w  x2½n=ðx1½n  x2½nÞ; for x1½n > x2½n; ð17Þ
w 	 x2½n=ðx1½n  x2½nÞ; for x1½n < x2½n; ð18Þ
which further lead to

where x½l1; . . . ;x½lr are the extreme points of the convex
hull and r 	 L is the total number of the extreme points.
Then, by (31) and (30), it follows that

where x½l1; . . . ;x½lr can be identified by using the quickhull
algorithm [34], a well-known extreme point search method.
Suppose that r extreme points, or equivalently resultant r
inequality constraints in (33), are found, the computational
complexity of the nLCA-IVM then becomes OðN2rÞ
instead of OðN2LÞ, where  is the number of iterations
involved. Due to the use of the quickhull algorithm, the
computational efficiency improvement of the proposed
nLCA-IVM can be measured by the constraint reduction
ratio, defined as
 ¼ L r
L
: ð34Þ
Surely, the larger the value of , the less the computational
complexity in solving (24).
Some BSS methods, nLCA-ES [23], CAMNS [22], nICA
[13], FastICA [12], NMF [14], quasi-Newton NMF (QNMF)
[18], and sparse NMF (sNMF) [17], can be easily verified to
have complexities (for the case ofM ¼ N) given by OðN3LÞ,
OððN  1Þ2LÞ, OðN2LÞ, OðN3LÞ, OðN2LÞ, and OðN2LÞ,
respectively. The complexity order comparison for the
above-mentioned BSS methods is listed in Table 2.
Obviously, the proposed nLCA-IVM has lower complexity
order than nICA, FastICA, NMF, QNMF, and sNMF.
A geometrical illustration of how the proposed
nLCA-IVM method works for the case of M ¼ N ¼ 3 is
shown in Fig. 3. For each row vector update of W, the
unmixed source, say y1, is moved to the boundary of the
feasible set, while fixing y2 and y3, such that V ðsolfy1; y2; y3gÞ
increases maximally (since the LP always yields the optimal
y1 on the boundary of the feasible set). By repeating the
procedure, the three sources will be literally identified.
Similarly, for the M ¼ N ¼ 2 case as shown in Fig. 2, the
nLCA-IVM algorithm involves only two row vector updates,
implying that the global optimal solution for W can be
obtained in only one iteration (in addition to one iteration for
the convergence check). Thus, we can conclude that the
proposed nLCA-IVM algorithm is able to provide the
globally optimal solution for M ¼ N ¼ 2 as given in
Proposition 1 above, but no guarantee of the global
optimality forM ¼ N > 2.
3.3 Source Identifiability of the nLCA
We address here the source identifiability problem of nLCA
concerning certain conditions (assumptions) under which
the N extracted sources are identical to all of the N true
sources. In many biomedical imaging [8], [21] and remote
sensing applications [24], [29], the sources meet the
assumption that pure-source samples exist:
. (A5) There exists at least one index set fl1; l2; . . . ; lNg
such that s½li ¼ si½liei, i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; N .
Note that the corresponding data points x½n for n 2
fl1; l2; . . . ; lNg become
x½li ¼ aisi½li; ð35Þ
where ai is the ith column vector of A. Namely, the data
point x½li is only contributed from source si. For investigat-
ing the source identifiability of the nLCA, the following
lemma is needed:
Lemma 1. Suppose that (A2), (A3), and (A4) hold and M ¼ N .
Then, jdetðAÞj 	 1, and the equality holds if and only ifA is a
permutation matrix.
The proof of Lemma 1 is given in Appendix B. Under
the existence of pure-source samples, the source identifia-
bility of the proposed nLCA is established in the
following theorem:
Theorem 2. (Source identifiability of nLCA). Suppose that
(A1)-(A5) hold. Then,
W?A ¼ P; ð36Þ
whereW? is the optimal solution of problem (24) and P is an
N N permutation matrix.
Proof. Substituting W? into the constraints of problem (24)
yields
W?1N ¼ 1N; ð37aÞ
W?x½n  0; n ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; L: ð37bÞ

iterations set to 2,000. The other two algorithms, nLCA-ES
and CAMNS, themselves are not iterative algorithms
(without involving convergence). For sNMF [17], the
regulation parameter controlling the sparseness constraint
was set to 0.6. Other parameter settings for QNMF are as
follows: At each iteration, the source matrix S is updated
using the fixed-point algorithm with regulation parameter

, where 0 ¼ 20, 	 ¼ 0:02, and 
 denotes the
iteration number, and the mixing matrixA is updated using
the quasi-Newton algorithm [18]. On the other hand, in the
last two experiments, the convergence tolerance was still set
to  ¼ 105 for the proposed nLCA-IVM.

sign (or the polarity) ambiguity between the extracted
source s^i and the true source si. The above performance
measure itself is an optimization problem to find the optimal
 and ci such that  is maximum, and it can be efficiently
solved by Kuhn-Munkres algorithm [37]. Note that the
larger the value of , the better the performance of the
associated algorithm under evaluation.
For the computational complexity comparison of the
proposed nLCA-IVM (including the use of the quickhull
algorithm) and the other seven algorithms, the computation
time (seconds) of each BSS algorithm (implemented with
Matlab 7.0) when executed using a Toshiba Satellite A100
laptop personal computer (equipped with Intel Centrino
Duo Processor T2050 CPU 1.6 GHz, 1 GB memory and
Microsoft windows XP home edition version 2002 with
service pack 2) was measured as the corresponding
computational complexity index.
5.1 Experiment 1: Human Face Image Separation
In this experiment, two test scenarios were considered. In the
first scenario, six 128 128 human face images (i.e.,
L ¼ 16;384) (shown in Fig. 4a) taken from [38] were used as
the source signals to generate six noise-free observations (i.e.,
M ¼ 6) and 20 noisy observations (i.e., M ¼ 20) with the
same signal-to-noise ratio (SNRi ¼ 25 dB, i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 20)
where SNRi ¼ kxi  ik2=ðL2i Þ and 2i is the variance of
independent and identically distributed zero-meanGaussian
noise components in i. In the second scenario, the same
simulation was performed except that only the first four
human face images in Fig. 4a were used. For the noise-free
case, apart from the mixtures of the original sources, we also
considered the case by artificially adding a set of pure-source
samples fs½li ¼ si½liei; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; Ng to the original
sources in order to verify the source identifiability of the
nLCA. For the noisy case, we applied the various BSS
methods to process the noise-reduced observations, i.e., xi,
i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; N , given by (46).
The values of averaged , denoted by ave, forN ¼ 6 in this
experiment are listed in Table 3. It is to bementioned that the
original six sources do not have pure-source samples. From
the table, one can observe that, for both the noise-free and
noisy cases, the proposed nLCA-IVM (with maximum ave)
outperforms all the other algorithms. For the case that pure-
source samples were artificially added in the original six
sources, nLCA-IVM, nLCA-ES, and CAMNS achieve perfect
separation (with ave ¼ 1), and hence, outperform all of the
other algorithms. These results indicate that the proposed
nLCA-IVM is less sensitive to the existence of pure-source
samples than nLCA-ES and CAMNS. In addition, it obtains
the global optimum solution for each realization when six
pure-source samples are artificially made existent in the
original sources, thus justifying the source identifiability of
thenLCA as stated inTheorem2 (despite noguarantee for the
global optimum solution when N > 2). One typical realiza-
tion among the 50 independent runs for the noiseless case is
shown in Fig. 4, where all of the separated images have been
properly ordered for ease of illustrative comparison among
all the BSS algorithms under test. One can see in Fig. 4 that the
separated images obtained by the nLCA-IVM match the

properly scaled and ordered for ease of illustrative
comparison among all the BSS algorithms under test. One
can see in this figure that the separated source spectra
obtained from nLCA-IVM; nLCA-ES, and CAMNS match
the original source spectra much better than those obtained
by the other algorithms.
5.3 Experiment 3: Dual-Energy X-Ray Image
Decomposition
Accurate detection of lung nodules (the early sign of lung
cancers) using dual-energy chest X-ray imaging is an
important diagnostic task. However, the presence of ribs
or clavicles overlapped with soft tissue presents significant
challenge to detect subtle nodules. Effective separation of
bone and soft tissues in dual-energy chest X-ray imaging is
highly desirable. In this experiment, we applied the
nLCA-IVM to process two mixed images of soft and bone
tissues (L ¼ 26;896) taken from [39] as shown in Fig. 6a. The
values of ave of all the BSS algorithms under test are also
given in Table 5. It is to be mentioned that two pure-source
samples exist in the original two sources. It can be seen
from the table that nLCA-IVM, nLCA-ES, and CAMNS all
perform perfectly (i.e., ave ¼ 1), justifying the source
identifiability of nLCA (as stated in Theorem 2) and the
global optimum solution achieved by the proposed
nLCA-IVM (see Proposition 1). On the other hand, the
value of Tave (0.46 second) associated with the proposed
nLCA-IVM is larger than that (0.06 second) associated with

as well as ai1 > 0, ai2 > 0, and ai1 þ ai2 ’ 1 for all i, which
are consistent with (A2) and (A4).
6 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a new nLCA method for the blind
separation of nonnegative and potentially correlated sources
with a given set of mixed observations. The optimum
unmixing matrix is obtained by minimizing the joint
correlation of all the separated source signals subject to the
nonnegativity constraint. A closed-form solution for the
unmixing matrix of the two-source case was provided. The
nLCA method is implemented by an iterative volume
maximization algorithm (i.e., nLCA-IVM) that uses compu-
tationally efficient LP solvers. We also proved the source
identifiability of the nLCA method under the existence of
pure-source samples (i.e., (A5)), and furthermore, it never
relies on (A5) and thus exhibits good performance even
when (A5) is not satisfied perfectly. Comparative experi-
mental results using simulated data were presented to
demonstrate the superior performance and computational
efficiency of the nLCA-IVM over several existing benchmark
methods. Evaluation of the proposed nLCA-IVM using real
biomedical data was also presented, which provides some
insights into the underlying biomedical relevant character-
istics and physiologies. Due to a variety of potential
biomedical imaging applications, nontrivial modifications
of this algorithm may be needed for specific applications,
and they are left as future research along with other
applications, where nBSS is needed.

4 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
BSS methods are ‘blind’ in the sense that the mixing process is not known,
at least not explicitly. But what is universally true for all BSS frameworks is
that we make certain presumptions on the source characteristics (and some-
times on the mixing characteristics as well), and then exploit such characteris-
tics during the blind separation process. For instance, independent component
analysis (ICA) [1, 2], a major and very representative BSS framework on which
many BSS methods are based, assumes that the sources are mutually uncorre-
lated/independent random processes possibly with non-Gaussian distributions.
There are many other possibilities one can consider; for example, using quasi-
stationarity [3, 4] (speech signals are quasi-stationary), and using boundness of
the source magnitudes [5, 6, 7] (suitable for digital signals). In choosing a right
BSS method for a particular application, it is important to examine whether the
underlying assumptions of the BSS method are a good match to the application.
For instance, statistical independence is a reasonable assumption in applications
such as speech signal separation, but it may be violated in certain imaging sce-
narios such as hyperspectral imaging [8].
This book chapter focuses on non-negative blind source separation (nBSS), in
which the source signals are assumed to take on non-negative values. Naturally,
images are non-negative signals. Potential applications of nBSS include biomed-
ical imaging [9], hyperspectral imaging [10], and analytical chemistry [11]. In
biomedical imaging, for instance, there are realistic, meaningful problems where
nBSS may serve as a powerful image analysis tool for practitioners. Such exam-
ples will be brieﬂy described in this book chapter.
In nBSS, how to cleverly utilize source non-negativity to achieve clean sepa-
ration has been an intriguing subject that has received much attention recently.
Presently available nBSS methods may be classiﬁed into two groups. One group
is similar to ICA: Assume that the sources are mutually uncorrelated or indepen-
dent, but with non-negative source distributions. Methods falling in this class
include non-negative ICA (nICA) [12], stochastic non-negative ICA (SNICA)
[13], and Bayesian positive source separation (BPSS) [14]. In particular, in nICA
the blind separation criterion can theoretically guarantee perfect separation of
sources [15], under an additional assumption where the source distributions are
non-vanishing around zero (this is called the well-grounded condition).
Another group of nBSS methods does not rely on statistical assumptions.
Roughly speaking, these methods explicitly exploit source non-negativity or even
mixing matrix non-negativity, with an attempt to achieve some kind of least
square ﬁtting criterion. Methods falling in this group are generally known as (or
may be vaguely recognized as) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [16, 17].
An advantage with NMF is that it does not operate on the premise of mutual
uncorrelatedness/independence as in the ﬁrst group of nBSS methods. NMF is a
nonconvex constrained optimization problem. A popular way of handling NMF
is to apply gradient descent [17], but it is known to be suboptimal and slowly
convergent. A projected quasi-Newton method has been incorporated in NMF
to speed up its convergence [18]. Alternatively, alternating least squares (ALS)

Example 1.2: Dynamic Fluorescent Imaging (DFI)
DFI exploits highly speciﬁc and biocompatible ﬂuorescent contrast agents to
interrogate small animals for drug development and disease research [29]. The
technique generates a time series of images acquired after injection of an inert
dye, where the dye’s diﬀerential biodistribution dynamics allow precise delin-
eation and identiﬁcation of major organs. However, spatial resolution and quan-
titation at depth is not one of the strengths of planar optical approaches, due
mainly to the malign eﬀects of light scatter and absorption.
The DFI data acquired in a mouse study, for instance, is shown in Figure
1.3, where each DFI image (observation) is delineated as a linear mixture of the
anatomical maps associated with diﬀerent organs. The BSS methods can be used
10 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
and a slow perfusion source images [9] can be higher than 95%. For high contrast
images such as human portraits, we found that (A2) would also be an appropriate
assumption.
We make two more assumptions
(A3) The mixing matrix has unit row sum; i.e., for all i = 1, . . . ,M ,
N∑
j=1
aij = 1. (1.3)
(A4) M ≥ N and A is of full column rank.
Assumption (A4) is rather standard in BSS. Assumption (A3) is essential to
CAMNS, but can be relaxed through a model reformulation [28]. Moreover, in
MRI (e.g., in Example 1.1), (A3) is automatically satisﬁed due to the so-called
partial volume eﬀect [28]. The following example shows how we can relax (A3):
Example 1.3: Suppose that the model in (1.2) does not satisfy (A3). For simplic-
ity of exposition of the idea, assume non-negative mixing; i.e., aij ≥ 0 for all (i, j)
(extension to aij ∈ R is possible). Under such circumstances, the observations are
all non-negative and we can assume that
xTi 1 = 0
for all i = 1, . . . ,M . Likewise, we can assume sTj 1 = 0 for all j. The idea is to
enforce (A3) by normalizing the observation vectors:
x¯i 
xi
xTi 1
=
N∑
j=1
(
aijs
T
j 1
xTi 1
)(
sj
sTj 1
)
. (1.4)
By letting a¯ij = aijsTj 1/x
T
i 1 and s¯j = sj/s
T
j 1, we obtain a model x¯i =∑N
j=1 a¯ij s¯j which is in the same form as the original signal model in (1.2). It is
easy to show that the new mixing matrix, denoted by A¯, has unit row sum [or
(A3)].
It should also be noted that the model reformulation above does not damage
the rank of the mixing matrix. Speciﬁcally, if the original mixing matrix A
satisﬁes (A4), then the new mixing matrix A¯ also satisﬁes (A4). To show this,
we notice that the relationship of A and A¯ can be expressed as
A¯ = D−11 AD2 (1.5)
where D1 = diag(xT1 1, ...,x
T
M1) and D2 = diag(s
T
1 1, ..., s
T
N1). Since D1 and D2
are of full rank, we have rank(A¯) =rank(A).
Throughout this chapter, we will assume that (A1)- (A4) are satisﬁed unless
speciﬁed.
12 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
The number P in (1.7) is called the aﬃne dimension, which characterizes the
eﬀective dimension of the aﬃne hull. The aﬃne dimension must satisfy P ≤
N − 1. Moreover,
Property 1.1. If {s1, . . . , sN} is an aﬃnely independent set (which means that
{s1 − sN , . . . , sN−1 − sN} is linearly independent), then the aﬃne dimension is
maximal; i.e., P = N − 1.
1.3.2 Convex Hull
Given a set of vectors {s1, . . . , sN} ⊂ RL, the convex hull is deﬁned as
conv{s1, . . . , sN} =
{
x =
N∑
i=1
θisi
∣∣∣∣ θ ∈ RN+ ,
N∑
i=1
θi = 1
}
. (1.8)
A convex hull would be a line segment for N = 2, a triangle for N = 3. This is
illustrated in Figure 1.5.

An important concept related to convex hull is that of extreme points, also
known as vertices. From a geometric perspective, extreme points are the ‘corner
points’ of the convex hull. A point x ∈ conv{s1, . . . , sN} is said to be an extreme
point of conv{s1, . . . , sN} if x can never be a convex combination of s1, . . . , sN
in a non-trivial manner; i.e.,
x =
N∑
i=1
θisi (1.9)
for all θ ∈ RN+ ,
∑N
i=1 θi = 1, and θ = ei for any i. Some basic properties about
extreme points are as follows:
Property 1.2. The set of extreme points of conv{s1, . . . , sN} must be either
the full set or a subset of {s1, . . . , sN}.

An illustration is shown in Figure 1.6(a) to pictorially demonstrate the aﬃne
hull equivalence in Lemma 1.1. Since Lemma 1.1 represents an essential part to
CAMNS, here we provide the proof to illustrate its idea.

Figure 1.6: A geometric illustration of the aﬃne hull equivalence in Lemma 1.1,
for the special case of N = 2, M = 3, and L = 3.
Proof of Lemma 1.1. Any x ∈ aﬀ{x1, ...,xM} can be represented by
x =
M∑
i=1
θixi, (1.12)
where θ ∈ RM , θT1 = 1. Substituting (1.2) into (1.12), we get
x =
N∑
j=1
βjsj , (1.13)
where βj =
∑M
i=1 θiaij for j = 1, ..., N , or equivalently
β = AT θ. (1.14)
Since A has unit row sum [(A3)], we have
βT1 = θT (A1) = θT1 = 1. (1.15)
This implies that βT1 = 1, and as a result it follows from (1.13) that x ∈
aﬀ{s1, ..., sN}.
On the other hand, any x ∈ aﬀ{s1, ..., sN} can be represented by (1.13) for
βT1 = 1. Since A has full column rank [(A4)], there always exist a θ such that
(1.14) holds. Substituting (1.14) into (1.13) yields (1.12). Since (1.15) implies
that θT1 = 1, we conclude that x ∈ aﬀ{x1, ...,xM}.
Thus, by constructing the observation aﬃne hull, the source aﬃne hull
will be obtained. Using the linear equality representation of an aﬃne hull,
16 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
Remember that we are dealing with non-negative sources. Hence, any source
vector si must lie in
S  aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} ∩ RL+
= A(C,d) ∩RL+
= {x | x = Cα + d, x  0, α ∈ RN−1}. (1.22)
Note that we have knowledge of S only through (1.22), a polyhedral set repre-
sentation. The following lemma plays an important role:
Lemma 1.3. The polyhedral set S is identical to the source convex hull; that is,
S = conv{s1, . . . , sN}. (1.23)
Following the illustration in Figure 1.6, in Figure 1.7 we geometrically demon-
strate the equivalence of S and conv{s1, . . . , sN}. This surprising result is due
mainly to the local dominance, and we include its proof here considering its
importance.
Proof of Lemma 1.3. Assume that z ∈ aﬀ{s1, ..., sN} ∩ RL+:
z =
N∑
i=1
θisi  0, 1T θ = 1.
From (A2), it follows that z[i] = θisi[i] ≥ 0, ∀i. Since si[i] > 0, we must have
θi ≥ 0, ∀i. Therefore, z lies in conv{s1, ..., sN}. On the other hand, assume that
z ∈ conv{s1, ..., sN}, i.e.,
z =
N∑
i=1
θisi, 1T θ = 1, θ  0
implying that z ∈ aﬀ{s1, ..., sN}. From (A1), we have si  0 ∀i and subsequently
z  0. This completes the proof for (1.23).
Furthermore, we can deduce from Lemma 1.2 and Property 1.3 that
Lemma 1.4. The set of extreme points of conv{s1, . . . , sN} is {s1, . . . , sN}.
Summarizing all the results above, we establish an nBSS criterion as follows:
18 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
special cases. It will also shed light into the volume maximization heuristics
considered in the later part of this chapter.
Consider the pre-image of the observation-constructed polyhedral set S, under
the mapping s = Cα + d:
F = {α ∈ RN−1 ∣∣ Cα + d  0 }
=
{
α ∈ RN−1 ∣∣ cTnα + dn ≥ 0, n = 1, . . . , L } (1.25)
where cTn is the nth row of C. There is a direct correspondence between the
extreme points of S and F [26]:
Lemma 1.5. The polyhedral set F in (1.25) is equivalent to a simplex
F = conv{α1, . . . ,αN} (1.26)
where each αi ∈ RN−1 satisﬁes
Cαi + d = si. (1.27)
The proof of Lemma 1.5 is given in Appendix 1.9.3. Since the set of extreme
points of a simplex conv{α1, . . . ,αN} is {α1, . . . ,αN} (Property 1.4), we have
the following alternative nBSS criterion:
Criterion 1.2 (Alternative form of Criterion 1.1). Use the aﬃne set ﬁtting
solution in Proposition 1.1 to compute (C,d). Then, ﬁnd all the extreme points
of the simplex
F = {α ∈ RN−1 ∣∣ Cα + d  0 } (1.28)
and denote the obtained set of extreme points by {αˆ1, . . . , αˆN}. Output
sˆi = Cαˆi + d, i = 1, . . . , N (1.29)
as the set of estimated source vectors.
It follows directly from Theorem 1.1 and Lemma 1.5 that
Theorem 1.2. The solution to Criterion 1.2 is uniquely given by the set of true
source vectors {s1, . . . , sN}, under the premises in (A1) to (A4).
In [26], we have used Criterion 1.2 to develop simple nBSS algorithms for
the cases of two and three sources. In the following we provide the solution
for the two-source case and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness using synthetic X-ray
observations:

1.5 Systematic Linear Programming Method for CAMNS
This section, as well as the next section are dedicated to the practical imple-
mentations of CAMNS. In this section, we propose an approach that uses linear
programs (LPs) to systematically fulﬁl the CAMNS criterion, speciﬁcally Crite-
rion 1.1. An appealing characteristic of this CAMNS-LP method is that Crite-
rion 1.1 does not appear to be related to convex optimization at ﬁrst look, and
yet it can be exactly solved by CAMNS-LP as long as the problem assumptions
(A1)-(A4) are valid.
Our problem as speciﬁed in Criterion 1.1 is to ﬁnd all the extreme points of the
polyhedral set S in (1.22). In the optimization literature this problem is known
as vertex enumeration; see [33, 34, 35] and the references therein. The available
extreme-point ﬁnding methods are sophisticated, requiring no assumption on
the extreme points. However, the complexity of those methods would increase
exponentially with the number of inequalities L (note that L is also the data
length in our problem, which is often large in practice). The notable diﬀerence of
the development here is that we exploit the characteristic that the extreme points
s1, ..., sN are linearly independent (Lemma 1.2). By doing so we will establish
an extreme-point ﬁnding method (for CAMNS) whose complexity is polynomial
in L.
Our approach is to identify one extreme point at one time. Consider the fol-
lowing linear minimization problem:
p = min
s
rT s
subject to (s.t.) s ∈ S
(1.35)
for some arbitrarily chosen direction r ∈ RL, where p denotes the optimal objec-
tive value of (1.35). By the polyhedral representation of S in (1.22), problem
(1.35) can be equivalently represented by an LP
p = min
α
rT (Cα + d)
s.t. Cα + d  0
(1.36)
which can be solved by readily available algorithms such as the polynomial-
time interior-point methods [36, 37]. Problem (1.36) is the problem we solve in
practice, but (1.35) leads to important implications to extreme-point search.
A fundamental result in LP theory is that rT s, the objective function of (1.35),
attains the minimum at a point of the boundary of S. To provide more insights,
some geometric illustrations are given in Figure 1.9. We can see that the solution
of (1.35) may be uniquely given by one of the extreme points si [Figure 1.9(a)],
or it may be any point on a face [Figure 1.9(b)]. The latter case poses a trouble to
our task of identifying si, but it is arguably not a usual situation. For instance,
in the illustration in Figure 1.9(b), r must be normal to s2 − s3 which may be
unlikely to happen for a randomly picked r. With this intuition in mind, we can
prove the following lemma:
22 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
that (1.36) and (1.37) should both lead to new extreme points. Interestingly, we
found theoretically that such an expectation is not true, but close. It can be
shown that (see Appendix 1.9.5)
Lemma 1.7. Suppose that r = Bw, where B ∈ RL×L is given by (1.39) and w
is randomly generated following a distribution N (0, IL). Then, with probability
1, at least one of the optimal solutions of (1.36) and (1.37) is a new extreme
point; i.e., si for some i ∈ {l + 1, ..., N}. The certiﬁcate of ﬁnding new extreme
points is indicated by |p| = 0 for the case of (1.36), and |q| = 0 for (1.37).
By repeating the above described procedures, we can identify all the extreme
points s1, ..., sN . The resultant CAMNS-LP method is summarized in Algorithm
1.1.

Step 4. If l = 0
Sˆ = [ Cα1 + d, Cα2 + d ]
else
If |p| = 0 then Sˆ := [ Sˆ Cα1 + d ].
If |q| = 0 then Sˆ := [ Sˆ Cα2 + d ].
Step 5. Update l to be the number of columns of Sˆ.
Step 6. Apply QR decomposition
Sˆ = Q1R1,
where Q1 ∈ RL×l and R1 ∈ Rl×l. Update B := IL −Q1QT1 .
Step 7. Repeat Step 2 to Step 6 until l = N .
The CAMNS-LP method in Algorithm 1.1 is not only systematically straight-
forward to apply, it is also eﬃcient due to the maturity of convex optimiza-
tion algorithms. Using a primal-dual interior-point method, each LP problem [or
the problem in (1.35) or (1.37)] can be solved with a worst-case complexity of
O(L0.5(L(N − 1) + (N − 1)3))  O(L1.5(N − 1)) for L N [37]. Since the algo-

Suppose that {β1, . . . ,βN} ⊂ F . As illustrated in the picture in Fig-
ure 1.10, the volume of conv{β1, . . . ,βN} should be no greater than that
of F = conv{α1, . . . ,αN}. Hence, by ﬁnding {β1, . . . ,βN} ⊂ F such that the
respective simplex volume is maximized, we would expect that {β1, . . . ,βN}
is exactly {α1, . . . ,αN}, the ground truth we are seeking. This leads to the

26 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
The objective function in (1.47) is still nonconvex, but (1.47) can be solved in a
globally optimal manner by breaking it into two LPs:

s.t. Cβj + d  0.
(1.49)
The optimal solution of (1.47), denoted by αˆj , is the optimal solution of (1.48) if
|p| > |q|, and the optimal solution of (1.49) if |q| > |p|. This partial maximiza-
tion is conducted alternately (i.e., j := (j modulo N) + 1) until some stopping
rule is satisﬁed.
The CAMNS alternating volume maximization heuristics, or simply CAMNS-
AVM, is summarized in Algorithm 1.2.

on a challenging scenario reminiscent of ghosting eﬀects in photography. Sec-
tion 1.7.3 considers a problem in which the sources are faces of ﬁve diﬀerent
persons. Section 1.7.4 uses Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance
of CAMNS-based algorithms under noisy condition. For performance compari-
son, we also test three existing nBSS algorithms, namely non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) [16], non-negative independent component analysis (nICA)
[12], and Ergodan’s algorithm (a BSS method that exploits magnitude bounds
of the sources) [6].
The performance measure used in this book chapter is described as follows. Let
S = [s1, . . . , sN ] be the true multi-source signal matrix, and Sˆ = [sˆ1, . . . , sˆN ] be
the multi-source output of a BSS algorithm. It is well known that a BSS algorithm
is inherently subject to permutation and scaling ambiguities. We propose a sum
square error (SSE) measure for S and Sˆ [40, 41], given as follows:

adjust the permutation π such that the best match between true and estimated
signals is yielded, while the factor ‖si‖/‖sˆπi‖ is to ﬁx the scaling ambiguity.
Problem (1.50) is the optimal assignment problem which can be eﬃciently solved

1252 = 15625). For the three source images, we found that the local dominance
assumption is not perfectly satisﬁed. To shed some light into this, we propose a
measure called the local dominance proximity factor (LDPF) of the ith source,
deﬁned as follows:
κi = max
n=1,...,L
si[n]∑
j =i sj [n]
. (1.51)
When κi =∞, we have the ith source satisfying the local dominance assumption
perfectly. The values of κi’s in this example are shown in Table 1.1, where we
see that the LDPFs of the three sources are strong but not inﬁnite.

1.8 Summary and Discussion
In this book chapter, we have shown how convex analysis provides a new avenue
to approaching non-negative blind source separation. Using convex geometry
concepts such as aﬃne hull and convex hull, an analysis was carried out to
show that under some appropriate assumptions nBSS can be boiled down to
a problem of ﬁnding extreme points of a polyhedral set. We have also shown
how this extreme point ﬁnding problem can be solved by convex optimization,
speciﬁcally by using LPs to systematically ﬁnd all the extreme points.
The key success of this new nBSS framework is based on a deterministic signal
assumption called local dominance. Local dominance is a good model assump-
tion for sparse or high-contrast images, but it may not be perfectly satisﬁed
36 Chapter 1. Convex Analysis for Non-negative Blind Source Separation with Application in Imaging
sometimes. We have developed an alternative to the systematic LP method that
is expected to yield better robustness against violation of local dominance. The
idea is to solve a volume maximization problem. Despite the fact that the pro-
posed algorithm uses heuristics to handle volume maximization (which is non-
convex), simulation results match with our intuitive expectation that volume
maximization (done by a heuristics) can exhibit better resistance against the
model mismatch.
We have carried out a number of simulations using diﬀerent sets of image
data, and have demonstrated that the proposed convex analysis based nBSS
methods are promising, both by visual inspection and by the sum-square-error
separation performance measure. Other methods such as nICA and NMF were
also compared to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed methods.

1.9.3 Proof of Lemma 1.5
Equation (1.25) can also be expressed as
F = { α ∈ RN−1 | Cα + d ∈ conv{s1, ..., sN} } .
Thus, every α ∈ F satisﬁes
Cα + d =
N∑
i=1
θisi (1.61)
for some θ  0, θT1 = 1. Since C has full column rank, (1.61) can be re-
expressed as
α =
N∑
i=1
θiαi, (1.62)
where αi = (CTC)−1CT (si − d) (or Cαi + d = si). Equation (1.62) implies
that F = conv{α1, ...,αN}.
We now show that F = conv{α1, ...,αN} is a simplex by contradiction. Sup-
pose that {α1, ...,αN} are not aﬃnely independent. This means that for some
γ1, . . . , γN−1,
∑N−1
i=1 γi = 1, αN =
∑N−1
i=1 γiαi can be satisﬁed. One then has
sN = CαN + d =
∑N−1
i=1 γisi, which is a contradiction to the property that
{s1, ..., sN} is linearly independent.
1.9.4 Proof of Lemma 1.6
Any point in S = conv{s1, ..., sN} can be equivalently represented by s =∑N
i=1 θisi, where θ  0 and θT1 = 1. Applying this result to (1.35), problem
(1.35) can be reformulated as
min
θ∈RN
∑N
i=1 θiρi
s.t. θT1 = 1, θ  0,
(1.63)
where ρi = rT si. We assume without loss of generality that ρ1 < ρ2 ≤ · · · ≤ ρN .
If ρ1 < ρ2 < · · · < ρN , then it is easy to verify that the optimal solution to (1.63)
is uniquely given by θ = e1. In its counterpart in (1.35), this translates into
s = s1. But when ρ1 = ρ2 = · · · = ρP and ρP < ρP+1 ≤ · · · ≤ ρN for some P ,
the solution of (1.63) is not unique. In essence, the latter case can be shown to
have a solution set
Θ = {θ | θT1 = 1, θ  0, θP+1 = ... = θN = 0}. (1.64)
We now prove that the non-unique solution case happens with probability
zero. Suppose that ρi = ρj for some i = j, which means that
(si − sj)T r = 0. (1.65)

1.9.6 Proof of Theorem 1.3
In problem (1.43), the constraints βi ∈ F = conv{α1, . . . ,αN} imply that
βi =
N∑
j=1
θijαj (1.71)
where
∑N
j=1 θij = 1 and θij ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , N . Hence we can write
Δ(β1, . . . ,βN ) = Δ(α1, . . . ,αN )ΘT , (1.72)
where Θ = [θij ] ∈ RN×N+ and Θ1 = 1. For such a structured Θ it was shown
that (Lemma 1 in [43])
|det (Θ)| ≤ 1 (1.73)
and that |det (Θ)| = 1 if and only if Θ is a permutation matrix. It follows from
(1.41), (1.72) and (1.73) that
V (β1, . . . ,βN ) =|det(Δ(α1, . . . ,αN )ΘT )|/(N − 1)!
= |det(Δ(α1, . . . ,αN ))||det(Θ)|/(N − 1)!
≤ V (α1, . . . ,αN ) (1.74)
and that the equality holds if and only if Θ is a permutation matrix, which
implies {β1, . . . ,βN} = {α1, . . . ,αN}. Hence we conclude that V (β1, . . . ,βN ) is
maximized if and only if {β1, . . . ,βN} = {α1, . . . ,αN}.

The goal of CAMNS-AVM is to estimate the sources s1, . . . , sN
from the given observations x1, . . . ,xM , assuming prior knowledge
of N . Moreover, CAMNS-AVM assumes that
(A1) For all j = 1, . . . , N , sj  0.
(A2) For each i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, there exists an (unknown) index `i
such that si[`i] > 0 and sj [`i] = 0, ∀j 6= i.
(A3) For all i = 1, . . . ,M ,∑Nj=1 aij = 1.
(A4) M ≥ N and A , [aij ]M×N is of full column rank.
Next, we will briefly review the CAMNS criterion [1, 8] and the
CAMNS-AVM [1].
2.1. CAMNS Criterion
We first define the polyhedral set S as follows:
S = { x | x = Cα+ d  0, α ∈ RN−1} (2)
where C and d are given by
d =
1
M
M∑
i=1
xi, C = [ q1(UU
T ), . . . , qN−1(UU
T ) ] (3)
in which U = [ x1 − d, . . . ,xM − d ] ∈ RL×M and qi(UUT )
denotes the unit-norm eigenvector associated with the ith principal
eigenvalue of UUT . Under assumptions (A1)-(A4), it has been
shown in [8] that S is equal to the source convex hull; i.e.,
S = conv{s1, . . . , sN} ,
{
x =
N∑
i=1
θisi
∣∣∣∣ θ  0, 1TLθ = 1
}
,
where θ = [θ1, . . . , θL]T , and that the extreme points of S are ex-
actly the true sources s1, . . . , sN . Then, consider the pre-image of
S under the affine mapping x = Cα+ d:
F =
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣Cα+ d  0 } (4a)
=
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ cTnα+ dn ≥ 0, n = 1, . . . , L }, (4b)
where cTn is the nth row vector of C and dn is the nth element of d.
It has been shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
extreme points of S and F , and that F is a simplex [1, 8], as stated
in CAMNS criterion:
CAMNS criterion [1]: Find all the extreme points of the polyhe-
dral set F given by (4a) and denote the obtained extreme points
by {α1, . . . ,αN}. Output
si = Cαi + d, i = 1, . . . , N, (5)
as the estimated sources.
2.2. Alternating Volume Maximization for CAMNS
To fulfill the CAMNS criterion, we consider the following simplex
volume maximization problem [1]:
{β?1 , . . . ,β
?
N} = arg max
β1,...,βN∈F
vol(β1, . . . ,βN ) (6)
= arg max
β1,...,βN∈F
|det (∆(β1, . . . ,βN ))| , (7)
where vol(β1, . . . ,βN) is the volume of conv{β1, . . . ,βN} [10]
and
∆(β1, . . . ,βN) =
[
β1 · · · βN

]

Fig. 1. A geometrical illustration of F and Problem (6) for N = 3.
A pictorial illustration of (7) for N = 3 is given in Figure 1. One
would expect that as |det (∆(β1, . . . ,βN))| reaches the maximum,
{β?1 , . . . ,β
?
N} = {α1, . . . ,αN}. This expectation has been theo-
retically proven in [1] under assumptions (A1)-(A4).
We handle Problem (7) by alternating optimization. Consider
the cofactor expansion for det(∆(β1, . . . ,βN)) along the jth col-
umn for any j ∈ {1, . . . , N}:
det(∆(β1, . . . ,βN)) = b
T
j βj + (−1)
N+jdet(BNj) (9)
where bj = [(−1)i+jdet(Bij)]N−1i=1 and Bij is the submatrix of
∆(β1, . . . ,βN) with ith row and jth column removed. The partial
maximization with respect to βj with all other βis fixed is expressed
as follows:
max
βj∈F
|bTj βj + (−1)
N+jdet(BNj)|. (10)
Such a partial maximization problem can be globally solved by the
following two LPs:
p? = max
βj∈F
b
T
j βj + (−1)
N+jdet(BNj), (11a)
q? = min
βj∈F
b
T
j βj + (−1)
N+jdet(BNj). (11b)
The optimal solution of (10) is chosen as the optimal solution of
(11a) if |p?| > |q?|, and is that of (11b) if |q?| > |p?|. Prob-
lem (11) can be implemented by available LP solvers, such as Se-
DuMi [11] and CVX [12]. The partial maximization problem (11)
is solved cyclically (i.e., j := (j modulo N ) +1) until some prede-
fined stopping rule is satisfied. Then, the sources can be estimated
by sˆj = Cβˆj+d, where {βˆ1, . . . , βˆN} is the outcome of the above
described alternating volume maximization process. The CAMNS-
AVM algorithm is summarized in Table 1.
3. FAST CAMNS-AVM ALGORITHM
In this section, we propose three complexity reduction methods for
CAMNS-AVM (respectively in each subsection) so that its compu-
tational efficiency can be significantly improved.
3.1. Volume maximization problem equivalence
Problem (7) can be simplified as stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. Consider the following problem:
max
β1,...,βN∈F
det(∆(β1, . . . ,βN)). (12)
The optimal solution of (12) is also optimal to (7).
The proof of Lemma 1 is given in Section 6.1. By the cofactor ex-
pansion for det(∆(β1, . . . ,βN)) given by (9), we can obtain the
jth partial maximization problem for (12) given by (11a) rather than
the two LPs given by both (11a) and (11b) in the original CAMNS-
AVM. Next, we will present how to reduce the computational com-
plexity in solving the LP in (11a).
thetically generated 7 mixtures from 7 human face images (M =
N = 7 and L = 76800). A sum square error (SSE) between sˆi and
si is used as the performance measure [1]. In addition, the compu-
tation time T (in secs) of the method (implemented in Mathworks
Matlab R2008a) running in a desktop computer equipped with Core
2 Duo CPU 2.33GHz, 4GB memory is used as our computational
complexity measure.
The average SSE and computation time T are shown in Table 4.
In Case A, the original CAMNS-AVM (in Table 1) is used. In Case
B, we consider the CAMNS-AVM with Steps 3 and 4 (in Table 1)
replaced by solving (11a) only. Case C is similar to Case B except
for F (in (11a)) replaced by (13). Finally, Case D is for the fast
CAMNS-AVM (given in Table 3). One can see that the average SSE
are the same for all the cases, and the computational efficiency im-
proves from Case A to Case D. In particular, the computation time T
in Case B is almost twice less than that in Case A. The computation
time T in Case C is significantly smaller than that in Case B, because
the redundant inequality constraints in F have been effectively re-
moved by Quickhull [9]. Furthermore, by using the customized LP
and the warm start mechanism, the computation time T in Case D is
less than that in Case C around 3 seconds. As a result, the computa-
tion time of the proposed fast CAMNS-AVM (Case D) is more than
ten times less than that of the original CAMNS-AVM (Case A).

Case B L =76800 27.19 224.94
Case C r =2186 27.19 41.02
Case D r =2186 27.19 38.08
In summary, the proposed fast CAMNS-AVM algorithm ob-
tained by the three computation reduction methods (as stated in
Lemma 1, Lemma 2, and the customized LP solver) has signifi-
cantly lower computational complexity than the original CAMNS-
AVM without any performance loss. The presented simulation re-
sults have shown that the computational efficiency of the proposed
fast CAMNS-AVM algorithm is much higher (one-order) than that
of the original CAMNS-AVM.
5. APPENDIX
6.1. Proof of Lemma 1. Since det(G) = −det(H) if H results
from G by interchanging any two column vectors, an optimal solu-
tion of (7) where det(∆(β?1 , . . . ,β?N)) ≥ 0 always exists. Hence,
Lemma 1 is proved. 
6.2. Proof of Lemma 2. Since xi  0, ∀i in image applications and
the data where xi[n] = 0 can be removed without loss of generality,
we have d  0 by (3). Then, an equivalent form of (4b) is derived
as follows:
F =
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ vTnα ≥ −1, n = 1, . . . , L } (16)
=
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ vTα ≥ −1,v ∈ conv{v1, . . . ,vL}}, (17)
where vn = cn/dn. The equivalence of (16) and (17) is proved
in Section 6.3 below. Moreover, any convex set can be rep-
resented by its extreme points [13], i.e., conv{v1, . . . ,vL} =
conv
{
vl1 , . . . ,vlr
}
, where vl1 , . . . ,vlr are the extreme points of
conv
{
v1, . . . ,vL
}
. Then, we have
F =
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ vTα ≥ −1,v ∈ conv{vl1 , . . . ,vlr}}
=
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ vnα ≥ −1, n = l1, . . . , lr }. (18)
Hence, (13) directly follows from (18). 
6.3. Proof of the equivalence between (16) and (17). Let
F1 =
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ vTnα ≥ −1, n = 1, . . . , L },
F2 =
{
α ∈ RN−1
∣∣ vTα ≥ −1,v ∈ conv{v1, . . . ,vL}}.
We first prove that F1 ⊆ F2. For any vector x ∈ F1 (i.e.,
v
T
nx ≥ −1, n = 1, . . . , L), it follows that θnvTnx ≥ −θn, n =
1, . . . , L for any θn ≥ 0 and
∑L
n=1
θn = 1. Then, we have
(
∑L
n=1 θnvn)
T
x ≥ −1. By letting v =
∑L
n=1 θnvn, it follows
that vTx ≥ −1, v ∈ conv
{
v1, . . . ,vL
}
, implying x ∈ F2.
Next, we prove F2 ⊆ F1. For any vector x ∈ F2, we have∑L
n=1
θnv
T
nx ≥ −1 for all θn ≥ 0 and
∑L
n=1
θn = 1. This
directly implies vTnx ≥ −1 by choosing θn = 1 and θi = 0 for any
n ∈ {1, . . . , L} and all i 6= n. Hence, x ∈ F1 is true. 

the endmember signature matrix whose ith column vector ai is the
ith endmember signature, s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T ∈ RN is the
nth abundance vector comprising N fractional abundances, w[n] =
[ w1[n], . . . , wM [n] ]
T is the zero-mean white Gaussian noise vector
(i.e.,N (0, σ2IM ), where σ2 is the noise variance) and L is the total
number of observed pixel vectors.
The goal of hyperspectral unmixing is to estimate the endmem-
ber signature matrix A and the abundances s[1], . . . , s[L] from the
noisy observed pixels y[1], . . . , y[L], assuming that the number of
endmembers N is known a priori.
We consider the following general assumptions that are applica-
ble to HU algorithms :
(A1) (Non-negativity condition) si[n] ≥ 0 ∀ i, n.
(A2) (Full additivity condition)   Ni=1 si[n] = 1 ∀ n.
(A3) min{L,M} ≥ N and A is of full column rank.
(A1) and (A2) are valid assumptions in hyperspectral imaging
because the abundances are fractional proportions [1–4]. In addition,
the number of pixels and that of spectral bands involved are larger
than the number of endmembers and each endmember has its unique
signature, which justifies (A3).
Before getting into the core of development, we need to describe
a basic, essential concept in MVES, namely convex hull and simplex
[9]. Given a set of vectors {a1, . . . , aN} ⊂ RM , the convex hull of
{a1, . . . , aN} is defined as

where θ = [ θ1, . . . , θN ]T ∈ RN . In addition, a convex
hull conv{a1, . . . , aN} is called a simplex if M = N − 1 and
a1, . . . , aN are affinely independent.
3. REVIEW OF MVES PROBLEM FORMULATION
The noise-free signal model given by (2) is considered here for re-
viewing the formulation and theory behind MVES problem [8]. Like
many other HU algorithms [1], we begin with dimension reduction
of the observed pixels by projecting them onto an observed-pixel-
constructed affine set [8, 10], as given in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. (Dimension reduction by affine set fitting [8]) Under
(A2) and (A3), the dimension-reduced pixel vector x˜[n] can be
obtained by an affine transformation of x[n]:
x˜[n] = CT (x[n]− d) ∈ RN−1, (4)
where (C,d) is the affine set fitting solution given by
d =
1
L


n=1
x[n], (5)
C = [ q1(UU
T ), q2(UU
T ), . . . , qN−1(UU
T ) ], (6)
whereU = [ x[1]−d, . . . ,x[L]−d ] ∈ RM×L, and qi(R) denotes
the eigenvector associated with the ith principal eigenvalue of R.
An important remark related to Lemma 1 is as follows:
(R1) The affine set fitting solution of the noisy observed pixels
(Cˆ, dˆ) (obtained from (5) and (6) by replacing x[n]withy[n])
gives a best approximation in the least-squares sense [10], and
it asymptotically approaches the true (C,d) for large L.
Since   Nj=1 sj [n] = 1 [(A2)], it follows by substituting the
noise-free signal model (2) into (4) that
x˜[n] =
N

j=1
sj [n]αj , (7)
where αj = CT (aj − d) ∈ RN−1 is the jth dimension-reduced
endmember signature. Moreover, due to si[n] ≥ 0 [(A1)], it has
been proven in [8] that
x˜[n] ∈ conv{α1, . . . ,αN} ⊂ RN−1, ∀n (8)
and conv{α1, . . . ,αN} is a simplex.
Based on Craig’s belief [4], the unmixing problem of finding a
minimum volume simplex enclosing all the dimension-reduced pix-
els can now be written as the following optimization problem [8]:
min
β1,...,βN∈R
N−1
V (β1, . . . ,βN)
s.t. x˜[n] ∈ conv{β1, . . . ,βN}, ∀ n,
(9)
where V (β1, . . . ,βN) is the volume of the simplex conv{β1, . . . ,
βN} given by [11]
V (β1, . . . ,βN) =
|det(B)|
(N − 1)! (10)
and B = [ β1 − βN , . . . ,βN−1 − βN ] ∈ R(N−1)×(N−1) . In
addition, by (3), we rewrite the constraint of (9) in terms of B as
x˜[n] = βN + Bθn, (11)
where θn  0 and 1TN−1θn ≤ 1. Hence, problem (9) can be equiv-
alently written as
min
B∈R(N−1)×(N−1),
βN ,θ1,...,θL∈R
N−1
|det(B)|
s.t. θn  0, 1TN−1θn ≤ 1,
x˜[n] = βN + Bθn, ∀ n.
(12)
By letting θn = Hx˜[n] − g for all n where H = B−1 and g =
B−1βN , one can eliminate the variables θn for all n in (12) and
come up with
max
H∈R(N−1)×(N−1), g∈RN−1
|det(H)|
s.t. 1TN−1(Hx˜[n]− g) ≤ 1,
Hx˜[n] − g  0, ∀ n.
(13)
Next, we will show how the MVES problem in (13) can be reformu-
lated for the noisy scenario.
4. ROBUST MVES PROBLEM AND ALGORITHM
Let us consider the noisy signal model given by (1). From (1), (4)
and (R1), we get
y˜[n]  CˆT (y[n]− dˆ) ∼= x˜[n] + CˆTw[n], (14)
where CˆTw[n] is a random vector following N (0, σ2IN−1) (since
CˆT is a semi-unitary matrix). Following the footsteps of the MVES
problem formulation, the robust MVES problem can be expressed
by replacing x˜[n] by y˜[n]− CˆTw[n] in (13):
max
H, g
|det(H)|
s.t. 1TN−1(Hy˜[n]−HCˆTw[n]− g) ≤ 1,
Hy˜[n]−HCˆTw[n]− g  0, ∀ n,
(15)
where 1TN−1HCˆ
Tw[n]  z[n] and HCˆTw[n]  u[n]
are a random variable and a random vector with distribu-
tionsN (0, σ21TN−1HHT1N−1) andN (0, σ2HHT ), respectively.
Since the constraints in (15) involve randomness, they can be man-
ifested as chance constraints so as to mitigate the noise effects in

for all n = 1, . . . , L. To ensure (A1), the negative values of  s[n] are
made zero. The above procedure is referred to as RMVES algorithm.
The proposed RMVES algorithm uses the well known VCA [3]
for the initialization of (24) [6]. The optimization problem in (24) is
then solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Moreover,
in each iteration of the RMVES algorithm (which involves N − 1
row updates of H), we use the solution of the previous iteration as
the initialization for the current iteration.
5. SIMULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
In this section, the efficacy of the proposed RMVES algorithm is
demonstrated using 50 Monte Carlo runs for various purity lev-
els and SNRs. In each run, 1000 noise-free observed pixel vec-
tors were synthetically generated following the signal model in (2),
where 6 endmembers (i.e., Alunite, Buddingtonite, Calcite, Copi-
apite, Kaolinite, and Muscovite) with 417 bands are selected from
USGS library [12], and the abundance vectors s[n] were generated
following Dirichlet distribution D(s[n], μ) with μ = 1
N
1N [3], for
different purity levels ρ = 0.7, 0.85, 1 [8]. The noisy data were
obtained by adding independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
zero-mean Gaussian noise to the noise-free data for different SNRs,
where SNR =  Ln=1 ‖x[n]‖22/σ2ML. To maintain non-negativity
of the noisy observed pixels, we artificially set the negative values of
the noisy pixels to zero. For performance comparison, we also tested
three existing algorithms, N-FINDR-FCLS [2,13] (where FCLS [13]
was used to find the associated abundances for the endmember esti-
mates of N-FINDR), MVSA [6], and the original MVES [8].
The root-mean-square (rms) spectral angle between the true one
and estimated one (which has been widely used in HU [1, 3, 8]) is
used as the performance index. We here denote rms spectral angle
between endmembers and their estimates as φen, and that between
abundance maps and their estimates as φab. By our extensive nu-
merical experience we found that η (which depends on ρ and SNR)
should be less than 0.5 (this can also be justified from Figure 1).
The average φen and φab of the unmixing algorithms over SNR
= 20, 25, ..., 40 dB and ρ = 0.7, 0.85, 1 are shown in Table 1,
where each bold-faced number denotes the minimum rms spectral
angle associated with a specific pair of (ρ,SNR) over all the algo-
rithms. Table 1 shows that the proposed RMVES algorithm yields
the best performance for ρ = 0.7 and 0.85. For all the values of
ρ, the RMVES algorithm is better than its predecessor, the MVES
algorithm. In addition, to investigate the problem natures of (22)
and (24), we simply performed Monte Carlo simulations by directly
solving (22) using SQP for ρ = 0.7 and SNR = 20 dB. The average
φen and φab were 9.04 and 24.73 degrees, respectively, which are
apparently much worse than those (1.69 and 9.21) of solving (24) in
an alternating fashion (RMVES algorithm). This may be attributed
to local optimality issues associated with the highly non-convex na-
ture of (22).
In conclusion, we have presented a robust hyperspectral unmix-
ing method, namely the RMVES algorithm which can effectively
unmix the highly mixed and noisy data. The RMVES algorithm ap-
plies chance constraints to accommodate the noise effects, and can
be suitably implemented using SQP solvers in an alternating fashion.
Simulation results showed that the RMVES algorithm outperforms
some existing benchmark algorithms and its predecessor MVES al-
gorithm. The application of RMVES algorithm to real hyperspectral
data would be our future direction.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Hyperspectral Imaging (HI) is a crucial technique to identify the materials and their composition
in an area by exploiting the spectral diversity of the observed hyperspectral data. Areas in which HI is
employed are diverse and they include mineral identification [1], space object identification [2], analytical
chemistry [3], retinal analysis [4], and many others. In this work we focus on HI for mineral identification
and quantification, wherein a hyperspectral sensor (usually located on an aircraft or satellite) records
the electromagnetic scattering patterns of materials present in an area, over hundreds of spectral bands
that range from visible to near-infrared wavelength region. The limited spatial resolution of the sensor
used for hyperspectral imaging demands an effective hyperspectral unmixing (HU) scheme to extract
the underlying endmember signatures (or simply endmembers) and the associated abundance maps (or
abundance fractions) distributed over a scene of interest. The endmember signature corresponds to the
reflection pattern of a mineral in different wavelengths and the abundance fraction is the fractional
distribution of a mineral over the given scene. The design of HU algorithms often (but not always) involves
dimension reduction as the preprocessing step. The dimension reduction algorithms are intended to reduce
the complexity of the unmixing algorithm that will be used in the sequel and they also aid in mitigating
the noise effects in the data cloud. Conventional dimension reduction algorithms for hyperspectral data
typically include principal component analysis (PCA) [5] and maximum noise fraction (MNF) [6]. A
detailed survey of various dimension reduction algorithms can be found in [7]. However, for these
algorithms (and also for the unmixing algorithms) the number of endmembers must be known a priori. A
Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based eigen thresholding method namely, virtual dimensionality (VD)
[8] is generally used for the estimation of number of endmembers from the hyperspectral observations.
Other algorithms that can be used to estimate the number of endmembers include Akaike information
criterion (AIC) [9] and minimum description length (MDL) [10]. Hyperspectral subspace identification
(HySiMe) [11] is a recently proposed dimension reduction algorithm, that can also estimate the number
of endmembers.
Conventional HU algorithms are based on linear mixing model (to be explained later) and can be
classified into two main categories. Algorithms in the first category are based on the existence of pure
pixels (pixels that are fully contributed by a single endmember) in the given hyperspectral observations,
and those in the second category are for mixed pixels without requiring the existence of pure pixels.
Figure 1 illustrates the notion of pure pixels and mixed pixels in a hyperspectral imaging scenario. The
red pixel corresponds to a mixed pixel (land, vegetation and water) and the blue pixel corresponds to a
October 22, 2010 DRAFT
4It should be mentioned that most non-pure pixel (mixed pixel) based algorithms are more computa-
tionally complicated than the pure pixel based algorithms, and are sensitive to initialization. On the other
hand, the presence of pure pixels cannot be guaranteed for hyperspectral data that are acquired under
poor spatial resolutions. Hence there exists a tradeoff between the two classes of algorithms, in terms
of computational tractability and accuracy. Nevertheless, the performance of the HU algorithms (both
pure-pixel based and non-pure-pixel based) degrades when the observations are noisy.
In recent years, several concurrent works on linear unmixing of noisy observations have also been
reported. Those works include joint Bayesian algorithm (JBA) [29] and simplex identification via split
augmented Lagrangian (SISAL) [30]. The JBA [29] is a statistical HU algorithm and assumes conju-
gate prior distributions for the abundances and endmember parameters. The endmember signatures are
estimated by using a hierarchical Bayesian model, which generates the posterior distributions of both
the abundances and the endmember parameters. The SISAL algorithm [30] is based on Craig’s criterion,
and it employs variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian approach to estimate the minimum volume
simplex. Further, it uses soft constraints to mitigate the effects of the outlier pixels.
In this work, we propose a robust minimum volume enclosing simplex (RMVES) algorithm for a
general case, where the pure-pixel assumption is no longer a necessity and the uniform/non-uniform
additive Gaussian noise is present in the observations. We begin with a linear mixing model and suitably
modify an existing dimension reduction method, called affine set fitting [25], so as to account for the
presence of noise. A toy example shown in Figure 2 demonstrates how Craig’s criterion may yield
inaccurate endmember estimates for the noisy observations (shown as dots).

6used in HU [1], [13], [17], [18], [32], [33]. We consider a scenario in which a hyperspectral sensor
measures solar electromagnetic radiation from N distinct substances. Owing to low spatial resolution,
each observed pixel vector represents a mixture of multiple distinct substances. Hence, each pixel vector
of the hyperspectral images measured over M spectral bands can be represented by the following M×N
linear mixing model
y[n] = x[n] +w[n], (1)
x[n] = As[n] =
N∑
i=1
si[n]ai, ∀ n = 1, . . . , L. (2)
In (1), y[n] = [ y1[n], . . . , yM [n] ]T represents the nth observed pixel vector comprising M spectral bands,
x[n] = [ x1[n], . . . , xM [n] ]
T corresponds to its noise-free counterpart, and w[n] = [ w1[n], . . . , wM [n] ]T
is the noise vector. In (2), A = [ a1, . . . ,aN ] ∈ RM×N denotes the endmember signature matrix with
the ith column vector ai being the ith endmember signature, s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T ∈ RN is the
nth abundance vector comprising N fractional abundances, and L is the total number of observed pixels.
The noise vector w[n] considered in the signal model (1) is zero-mean, uniform/non-uniform additive
Gaussian noise vector i.e., N (0,D), where D = diag(σ2i ) ∈ RM×M is a diagonal matrix and σ2i denotes
the noise variance in the ith spectral band. If σ2i = σ2j , ∀ i 6= j, then it is called uniform Gaussian noise,
else it is called non-uniform Gaussian noise. The additive Gaussian noise is a reasonable assumption and
is widely used in designing HU algorithms [1], [17], [29].
Assuming prior knowledge about the number of endmembers N , we aim to estimate the endmember
signature matrix A and the abundances s[1], . . . , s[L] from the noisy pixels y[1], . . . ,y[L], under the
following general assumptions [18], [32]:
(A1) Intensities of all the abundance vectors are non-negative, i.e., si[n] ≥ 0, for all i and n.
(A2) Abundance fractions are proportionally distributed in each observed pixel, i.e.,∑Ni=1 si[n] = 1, ∀ n.
(A3) min{L,M} ≥ N and the endmembers are linearly independent, i.e., A is of full column rank.
In the ensuing development, we employ two convex analysis concepts, namely, affine hull and convex
hull [31]. While the affine hull is employed for dimension reduction, the convex hull is used to infer the
geometry of the observations. For ease of later use, they are defined below:
• The affine hull of {a1, . . . ,aN} ⊂ RM is defined as

R.
It should be mentioned that under (A2) and (A3), the above dimension reduction procedure is a lossless
transformation in the absence of noise, and the dimension of the data is reduced from M to N − 1. An
illustration of dimension reduction via the affine set fitting procedure is given in Figure 3, where N = 3.

N−1, ∀ n (12)
and conv{α1, . . . ,αN} is a simplest simplex. This can be regarded as the outcome of the fact that the
affine transformation of a simplex is also a simplex, as one can infer from (2) that for all n, x[n] ∈
conv{a1, . . . ,aN}, and conv{a1, . . . ,aN} ⊂ RM is itself a simplex [by (A3)].
However, when the data are corrupted by noise, the observations can no longer lie in a single specific
affine set. Accordingly, for the noisy scenario, the approximate affine set fitting parameters (Ĉ and d̂)
can be obtained as explained below.

IV. BRIEF REVIEW OF MVES ALGORITHM
In this section, we briefly review the MVES formulation and algorithm [25]. The MVES algorithm is
based on Craig’s criterion [20] and it aims to solve the following optimization problem [18] [25]:
min
β1,...,βN∈RN−1
V (β1, . . . ,βN )
s.t. x˜[n] ∈ conv{β1, . . . ,βN}, ∀ n.
(20)
Here, x˜[n] is the dimension-reduced noise-free observation, β1, . . . ,βN correspond to the dimension
reduced endmember signatures, and V (β1, . . . ,βN ) is the volume of the simplex conv{β1, . . . , βN},
given by [35]
V (β1, . . . ,βN ) =
|det(B)|

where (N − 1)! represents factorial of N − 1 and
B = [ β1 − βN , . . . ,βN−1 − βN ] ∈ R
(N−1)×(N−1). (22)
By (5) and by (22), the constraints of (20) can be expressed as
x˜[n] =
N∑

Tw[n] is a random variable with the distribution
N (0, σ21TN−1HĈ

Qualitative discussion on η value: First and foremost, we notice that the random variables ui[n], i =
1, . . . , N −1, and z[n] are zero-mean Gaussian random variables. Next, we study the nature of the lower
bound on the abundance fractions, si[n], i = 1, . . . , N, for various ranges of η. To begin with, let us
consider a general chance constraint, Pr(a ≤ b) ≥ η, where a is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable
and b ∈ R is a constant. The probability density function f(a) of the random variable a is shown in
Figure 4, where the shaded region corresponds to Pr(a ≤ k) = η, for a fixed η value in a given range,
and k is the corresponding lower bound of b such that Pr(a ≤ b) ≥ η always holds. As one can observe,
for η < 0.5, η = 0.5, and η > 0.5, k will be non-positive, non-negative, and positive, respectively.
Applying these inferences to (30b) and (30c) of (30), we have the following observations:
• The case of η > 0.5: From (30b), the lower bound on the abundance fractions si[n] = hTi y˜[n] −
gi, i = 1, . . . , N − 1, must be positive. Further, from (27b), we have −sN [n] = 1TN−1Hy˜[n] −
1TN−1g − 1 (where the full additivity constraint is implicit here), by which (30c) can be written as
Pr(−z[n] ≤ sN [n]) ≥ η. Thus, for η > 0.5, it could be readily inferred that the lower bound on
sN [n] must be positive. These constraints on the abundances of problem (30) will result in a simplex
that will enclose all the data points. A larger η value (η ∈ (0.5, 1)) will make the lower bound on
the abundances more positive, and will result in a larger estimated simplex than the one estimated
under the constraints of (28) (i.e., [(A1)] and [(A2)]).
• The case of η = 0.5: By similar arguments, one can conclude from (30b) and (30c) that si[n] i =
1, . . . , N − 1 must be non-negative and −sN [n] must be non-positive, respectively. This along with
the full-additivity constraint (as implicit in (30c)) is exactly the constraints of (28) as dictated by
Craig’s criterion. Hence, when η = 0.5, the simplex estimated by (30) will exactly be the same as
the simplex estimated by (28).
• The case of η < 0.5: In this case, the abundance fractions si[n], i = 1, . . . , N (refer to (30b) and
(30c)) are allowed to take negative values (the negative lower bound on the abundances depends on
η value), which makes the simplex to leave some observations outside the estimated simplex. Thus
the estimated simplex will be smaller than (in fact, a subset of) the ones estimated for η ≥ 0.5, and
therefore is expected to be close to the true simplex.
The chance constraints in (30) can be further simplified by normalizing the random variables involved [31].

which is exactly the constraint set of (31). As Φ−1(η) and Φ−1(1 − η) are monotone increasing and
decreasing functions of η, respectively, one can infer that F(η1) ⊆ F(η2), ∀ η1 ≥ η2. Further, it could
be inferred that, when η = 0.5, the constraint set F(0.5) of (31) is the same as that of (28). Thus, the
optimal |det(H)| will be larger for smaller η. Also note from (26a) that an increased value of |det(H)|
corresponds to a decreased value of |det(B)| = 1/|det(H)| (i.e., a smaller simplex), which is what we
wish to achieve, so that the estimated simplex will be close to the true simplex. Thus, we can further
conclude that the apt range of η should be between 0 and 0.5. Finally, it is worthwhile to mention
that when η = 0, |det(H)| becomes unbounded as F(0) = R(N−1)×(N−1) × RN−1 and hence |det(B)|
becomes zero, and for the other extreme case of η = 1, problem (31) becomes infeasible (as could be
inferred from (32)), since F(1) = φ (empty set).
Figure 5 illustrates a scatter plot (for N = 3) of the dimension-reduced noisy observations and the
simplex, conv{α1,α2,α3} obtained by the RMVES algorithm (to be presented below) for different
values of η. As elaborately discussed above, one can see from Figure 5 that when η < 0.5, the solution
of RMVES problem approaches the true simplex (as some of the outlier pixels or possibly noisy pixels
are left outside the simplex). When η = 0.5 the minimum volume simplex tightly encloses all the
observations, and when η > 0.5, the simplex expands, but still encloses all the observations. Note that
for η ≥ 0.5, the estimated simplex is away from the true simplex.
While the feasible set of (31) could be convex or non-convex (depending on η), the objective function
of (31) is always non-convex. Inspired by our previous works [25] [34], we utilize the alternating
optimization methodology, by virtue of which we form subproblems that are hopefully “less non-convex”
than (31). We consider the cofactor expansion for det(H) along the ith row of H:
det(H) =
N−1∑
j=1
(−1)i+jhijdet(Hij), (33)
where Hij is the submatrix of H with the ith row and jth column removed. One can observe from (33)
that det(H) is linear in each hTi , which enables us to update hTi and gi while fixing the other rows of
H and the other entries of g. Then the partial maximization of (31) with respect to hTi and gi can be
October 22, 2010 DRAFT

solution of the maximization problem (35a) if |p?| > |q?|, and that of the minimization problem (35b)
if |q?| > |p?|. This row-wise maximization is conducted cyclically (i.e., i := (i modulo (N − 1)) + 1
via each row update of H). We define one iteration as one full update of the matrix H and the vector
g. At each iteration, if the relative change in |det(H)| between the current and the previous iterations
exceeds a given threshold, then we continue with the next updating iteration, else the updated H and g
are the obtained optimum estimates. It should be noted that though the sub-problems (35a) and (35b) are
non-convex, the objective functions are now linear (convex). From our simulation experience, we found
that this strategy substantially aids in mitigating the local optimality issue associated with the problem
(31) (this will be discussed in Section VI-C).
Suppose that a solution (H?, g?) is obtained by the above mentioned alternating maximization method.
From (11), (26a), (26b), the endmember signatures can then be recovered by âi = Cα̂i + d for i =
1, . . . , N , where

for all n = 1, . . . , L and [·]+ denotes element-wise non-negative projection, so as to ensure the non-
negativity of the abundance fractions (since the simplex estimated by RMVES will no longer enclose
all the dimension-reduced data completely). The above illustrated procedure is collectively termed as the
RMVES algorithm.
The proposed RMVES algorithm uses the well known VCA [17] for the initialization of (34) [32]. The
endmember estimates obtained by VCA are first expanded until all the dimension-reduced data are well
within the simplex formed by the expanded endmember estimates. The expanded endmember estimates
are then used to get the initial estimates of H (by (26a)) and g (by (26b)). The pseudo-code of the
expanded VCA, that is used for RMVES initialization [24] is given in Table I. The pseudo-code of the
proposed RMVES algorithm is given in Table II.

parameter ρn of the nth abundance vector s[n] is defined as ρn = ‖s[n]‖ (the Euclidean norm of that
abundance vector [25]), which indicates the quantitative dominance of an endmember ai in the observed
pixel vector x[n] =
∑N
i=1 si[n]ai. It should be clear that the purity of the observed pixel x[n] is higher
for larger ρn. In the simulations, we define a parameter ρ, which means that the ρn for all the abundance
vectors lies between ρ− 0.1 and ρ. In each simulation scenario a pool of 10, 000 pixels were generated
randomly by following the Dirichlet distribution and then 1000 vectors (L = 1000) with ρn ∈ [ρ−0.1, ρ]
are taken from the generated pool, for a given purity parameter ρ. The purity levels considered in our
simulations are ρ = 0.6, 0.8, 1. Choosing a best η value for a given data set is cumbersome, as the apt
η value is always data dependent. Therefore, here we discuss how to set the η value for the RMVES
algorithm. As previously inferred, the value of η (which depends on ρ and SNR) should be less than
0.5, and from our extensive simulation experience we found that η should lie in the range of 0.01 to
0.0001. Therefore, in each simulation and real data experiment (see Section VII), η value for the RMVES
algorithm is set to 0.001, and since (34) is non-convex, for each given data (under a given scenario),
the RMVES algorithm is executed 10 times with 10 different expanded VCA initializations (since each
time VCA yields different endmember estimates for noisy observations), and the endmember signature
and abundance fractions associated with the largest |det(H)| is chosen as the optimal endmember and
abundance estimates for the data under consideration. Such a technique has been applied before in
handling non-convex problems, e.g., [38].
A. Uniform Gaussian noise case
For uniform Gaussian noise case, the noisy data were obtained by adding independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean Gaussian noise vector to the noise-free data for different SNRs, where
SNR =
∑L
n=1 ‖x[n]‖
2
2/(σ
2ML). To maintain non-negativity of the observed pixels, we artificially set
the negative values of the noisy pixels to zero. Table IV shows the results (φen and φab) of all the
algorithms under test for observations corrupted by uniform Gaussian noise for SNRs between 15 dB
and 40 dB, and ρ = 0.6, 0.8, 1. For each scenario, the best (minimum φen and φab) out of all the algorithms
is highlighted as a bold-faced number. As one can infer from Table IV the proposed RMVES algorithm
yields the best performance for highly mixed case (ρ = 0.6) when SNR≥ 20 dB. For moderately mixed
case (ρ = 0.8) RMVES is the best when SNR≥ 30 dB and for other SNRs ICE is better. As expected,
when pure pixels exist in the data (ρ = 1), though SGA is better for SNR ranging from 20 dB to 30
dB, the performance of the other pure pixel based methods such as N-FINDR and VCA are comparable
with each other, and in few other scenarios ICE and APS fares well. However, for all the values of ρ,

initialization and with ten VCA initializations, and choosing the spectral angle associated with the maximum |det(H)|.
VII. REAL DATA EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed RMVES algorithm using the AVIRIS
data taken over the Cuprite Niveda site [39], as a good library of endmember signature is available [36],
[37] and thus can be used for performance evaluation. The AVIRIS data is challenging because of two
reasons. One reason is that the spatial resolution is not so high (about 17 m per pixel) and the other reason
is that the true total number of endmembers and the associated minerals are yet to be accurately identified.
While, initially it was concluded that there are about 13 minerals (endmembers) in the site, the number
kept increasing and later it was reported that there are around 70 mineral compounds (endmembers) [40]
present in the site and the number is still expected to rise. In our experiment we considered a 200× 200
sub-image of the hyperspectral data, with 224 spectral bands. The bands 1 − 2, 104 − 113, 148 − 167,
and 221− 224 are less significant (due to strong noise or dense water-vapor content) and were removed.
A total of 188 bands is therefore considered. Estimation of the number of endmembers present in a
given scene of interest is an important issue, because both the dimension reduction algorithm and the
HU algorithm are in need of this number. To begin with, the eigenvalue distribution (signal energies
distribution) of the data covariance matrix tells that the number of sources according to the principal
eigenvalues is approximately 4 (N = 4). Obviously, it is an under estimate of N , as the ground truth
[36] reports more than 4 endmembers in the selected region of interest (ROI). Applying HySiMe [11] to
the cropped data set yields N = 18. On the other hand, for a very similar region of interest, it is reported
in [17] and [25] that Virtual Dimensionality (VD) [8] estimates the number of endmembers as 14. Also

VIII. CONCLUSION
In this work, we have presented a robust HU algorithm, namely RMVES (as shown in Table II), for
effective unmixing of mixed hyperspectral data corrupted by uniform or non-uniform Gaussian noise. The
dimension reduction via affine set fitting procedure has been suitably modified for noisy hyperspectral
observations. The randomness caused by noise has been dealt by incorporating chance constraints in
the unmixing problem formulation with a design parameter η. A detailed analysis on the role of η has
been presented, and it was concluded that η must be less than 0.5, which along with the objective
function results in a non-convex optimization problem. To minimize the effect of non-convexity of
the objective function, an alternating optimization concept has been utilized. The partial maximization
problems involved are handled by using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solvers. Finally, Monte-
Carlo simulations and real data experiments presented in VI and Section VII, respectively, demonstrate

A and the abundances s[1], . . . , s[L] from the given noisy pixels
y[1], . . . ,y[L], under the following general assumptions [5, 6]:
(A1) (Non-negativity condition) si[n] ≥ 0 ∀ i, n.

3. REVIEW OF AVMAX ALGORITHM
As in many other HU algorithms, we begin with the dimension re-
duction of the observations. In our work, we employ the affine set
fitting procedure in [5] to perform dimension reduction. To begin
with, we start with the noise-free signal model, given by (2). The
affine set fitting procedure is summarized as follows:
Lemma 1. (Dimension reduction by affine set fitting [5, 6]) Under
(A2) and (A3), a dimension-reduced pixel vector x˜[n] can be ob-
tained by an affine transformation of x[n]:
x˜[n] = CT (x[n]− d) ∈ RN−1, (4)
where (C,d) is the affine set fitting solution given by
d =
1
L
L∑
n=1
x[n], (5)
C = [ q1(UU
T ), q2(UU
T ), . . . , qN−1(UU
T ) ], (6)
where U = [ x[1] − d, . . . ,x[L] − d ] ∈ RM×L, and qi(R) de-
notes the orthonormal eigenvector associated with the ith principal
eigenvalue ofR.
The affine set fitting solution (Cˆ, dˆ) for noisy observations is ob-
tained by replacing x[n] in (5) and (6) with y[n]. In the noisy case,
(Cˆ, dˆ) serves as a best least-squares approximation to true (C,d)
and the former asymptotically approaches the latter for large L. By
(2), (4) and under (A1)-(A3), it has been proved in [8] that
x˜[n] ∈ conv{γ1, . . . ,γN}, (7)
where γj = CT (aj − d) ∀j = 1, . . . , N correspond to dimension
reduced endmembers.
Now, the main problem is how we estimate γ1, . . . ,γN from
x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]. Winter [3] proposed a belief that under (A4) the ver-
tices of the maximum volume simplex inside the data cloud (obser-
vations) yield high fidelity estimates of the endmember signatures.
Based on that, the unmixing problem [5] can be written as:
max
ν1,...,νN∈R
N−1
V (ν1, . . . ,νN )
s.t. νi ∈ conv{x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]}, ∀ i,
(8)
where V (ν1, . . . ,νN ) is the volume of the (N − 1)-dimensional
simplex conv{ν1, . . . , νN} in RN−1 and is given by [9],
V (ν1, . . . ,νN ) =
|det (Δ(ν1, . . . ,νN ))|
(N − 1)!
, (9)
where
Δ(ν1, . . . ,νN ) =
[
ν1 · · · νN
1 · · · 1
]
.
By letting X˜ = [ x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L] ] ∈ R(N−1)×L and by (3), problem
(8) can be expressed as
max
νi∈R
N−1
θ1,...,θN∈R
L
|det(Δ(ν1, . . . ,νN ))|
s.t. νi = X˜θi, θi  0, 1
T
Lθi = 1 ∀ i.
(10)
Though the constraints of (10) are convex, the non-convexity of the
objective function makes the problem difficult to solve. The prob-
lem may be handled in a convenient manner by the idea of cofactor
expansion and alternating optimization. The cofactor expansion of
the objective function in (10) along the jth column is given by
det(Δ(ν1, . . . ,νN )) = b
T
j νj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj), (11)
where bj = [(−1)i+jdet(Vij)]N−1i=1 ∈ R
N−1 and the term Vij ∈
R
(N−1)×(N−1) is a submatrix of Δ(ν1, . . . , νN) with the ith row
and jth column removed. We then consider the partial maximization
of (10) with respect to νj and θj , while fixing νi and θi for all i = j.
The problem (10) then becomes
max
νj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
∣∣∣ bTj νj + (−1)N+jdet(VNj)
∣∣∣
s.t. νj = X˜θj , θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1.
(12)
The partial maximization problem (12) can be decomposed into the
following two linear programs:
p = max
νj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
b
T
j νj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t. νj = X˜θj , θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1,
(13)
q = min
νj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
b
T
j νj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t. νj = X˜θj , θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1.
(14)
The optimal solution of (12) is that of (13) if |p| > |q|, and that
of (14) if |q| > |p|. This procedure of alternating optimization
is performed for all the N columns (one iteration) and the relative
change in the volume of the updated Δ(ν1, . . . ,νN ) is compared
with a given threshold. If it exceeds the threshold, we continue with
the next updating iteration, else we conclude that the current updated
νjs are optimum. Once the optimal solution of (10), denoted by
ν1 , . . . ,ν

N is obtained, the endmember estimates can be recovered
by using, aˆi = Cνˆi + d (by virtue of (4)) for all i. Next, we aim to
make AVMAX more robust against noise effects.
4. ROBUST AVMAX FORMULATION AND ALGORITHM
In this section, we first do some reformulation to (13) and (14) so that
chance constraints can be incorporated into the unmixing problem.
Then, we move on to develop a robust version of AVMAX.
4.1. Restructuring the AVMAX algorithm
Now, let B = diag(sign(bj)) and G = −B. Then, we can have
GG = BB = IN−1, bTj B = |bj |T and bTj G = −|bj |T . The
subproblems (13) and (14) can then be equivalently written as:
p = max
νj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
b
T
j BBνj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t. Bνj = BX˜θj , θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1,

In all these algorithms, FCLS [10] is used to get the abundance
maps. The performance of the algorithms under test is evaluated
by performing 50 Monte Carlo runs for various purity levels (ρ)
and SNRs [8]. The simulation settings are L = 1000 (number of
pixels), N = 6 (number of endmembers) and M = 417 (number
of observations). In each run, 1000 noise-free observed pixel vec-
tors were synthetically generated following the signal model in (2),
and the 6 endmembers (i.e., Alunite, Buddingtonite, Calcite, Copi-
apite, Kaolinite, and Muscovite) with 417 bands are selected from
USGS library [11], and the abundance vectors s[n] were generated
following Dirichlet distribution D(s[n],μ) with μ = 1N/N [4],
for purity levels ρ = 0.7, 0.85, 1. The synthetic data for differ-
ent SNRs were obtained by adding independent and identically dis-
tributed zero-mean Gaussian noise to the noise-free data generated,
as per (1), and the SNR is defined as
∑L
n=1 ‖x[n]‖
2
2/σ
2ML. In
our simulations, the noise covariance matrix is estimated from the
observations, using the procedure elaborated in HySime [12]. The
performance index employed is the root-mean-square (rms) spectral
angle between the true one and estimated one [1,4,8]. The rms spec-
tral angles between endmembers and their estimates are denoted as
φen, and those between abundance maps and their estimates are de-
noted as φab. The average φen and φab of the unmixing algorithms
over SNR = 20, 25, ..., 40 dB and ρ = 0.7, 0.85, 1 are shown in
Table 1, where each bold-faced number denotes the minimum rms
spectral angle associated with a specific pair of (ρ,SNR) over all
the algorithms. One can readily infer from Table 1 that the proposed
RAVMAX algorithm generally yields the best performance for all
the values of ρ and SNRs.
6. CONCLUSION
To account for the noise effects in an HU framework, we have pre-
sented a robust HU algorithm, i.e., RAVMAX. Here, we reformu-
lated the original AVMAX problem with deterministic constraints
into the one with chance constraints. The RAVMAX problem can
be efficiently solved by using available second-order cone program
solvers. The simulation results demonstrate the superior perfor-
mance of RAVMAX over some existing benchmark HU algorithms
including the original AVMAX. The performance of RAVMAXwith
real hyperspectral data is currently under investigation.
7. APPENDIX
Proof of Lemma 2: Firstly, it is trivial to show that the objective
function of (19) is equivalent to that of (13) as αj = Bνj , bTj B =
|bj |
T and BB = I. Next, consider the subproblem (19) (after ig-
noring the constant term in the objective function) and let S denote
the constraint set of (19). Then we have
max
αj∈S
|bj |
T
αj = |bj |
T
kj ,
where kj = [maxSi [αj ]i]
N−1
i=1 in which Si = {[αj ]i ≤ [BX˜θj ]i},
implying that an optimal solution, denoted by (αj ,θj ) will make
the equality in αj  BX˜θj hold (i.e., the constraint will be ac-
tive). In other words, the optimal solution (αj , θj ) belongs to the
set {(αj ,θj) | αj = BX˜θj ,θj  0, 1TLθj = 1}, which is equiv-
alent to the constraint set of (13). Hence we can conclude that the
subproblems (19) and (13) are equivalent. By a similar argument the
equivalence of (20) and (14) can be proved.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Hyperspectral imaging devices with high spectral resolution utilize more than a hundred contiguous
spectral bands to produce a set of remotely sensed images, thereby facilitating identification of composi-
tion of disparate materials over the observed scene [1], [2]. Hyperspectral imaging techniques have been
applied to various fields, including space object detection and planet exploration in space [3], [4], as well
as environmental monitoring and military surveillance on the Earth [5], [6]. In these hyperspectral images,
each pixel physically represents a surface area and could cover more than one materials (depending
on the spatial resolution of the sensor), and hence each observed pixel spectrum usually comprises
multiple spectra of materials (or endmember signatures). How the endmember signatures can be accurately
recovered from the measured data, or namely the endmember extraction problem, has been a subject of
numerous investigations during the past decade [7], [8].
A major branch of algorithms for endmember extraction is based on Craig’s belief [9], which states that
the vertices of a minimum-volume simplex enclosing all the observed pixel vectors may serve as reliable
estimates of the endmembers. Algorithms that are based on Craig’s belief, either explicitly or implicitly,
include iterated constrained endmembers (ICE) [10], minimum volume constrained non-negative matrix
factorization (MVC-NMF) [11], minimum volume simplex analysis (MVSA) [12], and minimum-volume
enclosing simplex (MVES) [13], to name a few. In [13], we have shown that Craig’s belief yields the true
endmembers (or shortly the endmember identifiability) when there exist pure pixels (i.e., pixels composed
of a single endmember). Moreover, by empirical experience, these Craig’s belief based methods work
well even when the pure pixel assumption is violated to a certain extent. However, they can be expensive
to implement computationally, due mainly to the complexity of Craig’s problem.
Another branch of endmember extraction algorithms, which are generally simpler to implement, as-
sumes the existence of pure pixels and attempts to search for those pure pixels as endmember estimates.
The pure pixel assumption generally holds for cases where the remote sensing platforms (or aircrafts) fly
at a low altitude or perform small-area surveillance [14]. In the late 90’s, Winter proposed an endmember
extraction belief, which states that the volume of a simplex formed by the pure pixels is the maximum.
In that work Winter also developed an algorithm called N-finder (N-FINDR) [15], [16], which has
nowadays been widely used for real hyperspectral data analysis. N-FINDR examines individual pixels and
recalculates the simplex volume until it reaches the maximum. Winter’s idea has stimulated much interest,
and in recent years we have seen many different variants of N-FINDR, in which various pixel search
strategies are employed for efficient implementations of N-FINDR: [17]–[19] considered several types of

• We propose an alternating optimization-based algorithm for the Winter problem, called alternating
volume maximization (AVMAX). This algorithm can converge to a stationary point of the Winter
problem, by a result in alternating optimization. Its endmember identifiability is also proven.
• We propose a successive optimization-based algorithm for the Winter problem, called successive
volume maximization (SVMAX). The development there utilizes a special decomposition of the
simplex volume function (to be presented in Lemma 4), which will be derived in this paper. The
endmember identifiability of SVMAX is also proven.
• We formulate a robust worst-case Winter problem for accounting for the noise effects. The newly
formulated problem is in form of max-min optimization, and it is more difficult to handle than
the original Winter problem. An algorithm incorporating alternating optimization and projected
subgradients is proposed to tackle the robust Winter problem.
It is worthwhile to mention the relationship of this work and the other existing studies. Our AVMAX
method turns out to be very similar to NSS-N-FINDR [20] (an N-FINDR variant) algorithmically.
However, our work also touches on convergence issues. As another interesting coincidence, our SVMAX
method is strikingly similar to VCA. In fact, in a previous work [18], the possible connection of
VCA and Winter’s belief has been alluded to. Here, in order to consolidate the similarity claim, not
only the successive optimization concept is needed, but we also need to derive a special determinant
decomposition lemma (Lemma 4). Furthermore, we should mention concurrent works on dealing with
noise in endmember extraction: In the joint Bayesian algorithm (JBA) [26], a Bayesian estimation
framework accounting for the presence of noise explicitly was employed; in simplex identification by
split augmented Lagrangian (SISAL) [27], soft constraints are utilized to mitigate outlier pixel effects
caused by noise; in robust MVES (RMVES) [28] we apply chance constraints on the original MVES
constraints. Our worst-case optimization for handling the noise effects is nonetheless different from the
existing works in terms of the criterion (or belief).
B. Organization of the Paper and Notations
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the problem statement of endmember
extraction and its convex geometry. Section III presents the problem formulation for Winter’s belief.

6B. Convex Geometry Representation
In our previous works [13], [33], [34] (also [35], [36] for earlier attempts by others), we have developed
a convex geometry framework for analyzing hyperspectral mixing models, using the notion of convex
analysis [37]. Here, we follow this previous framework to formulate the problem herein.
In convex analysis, an affine hull of a set of vectors, say {a1, . . . ,aN}, is defined as
aff{a1, . . . ,aN} =
{
x =
N∑
i=1
θiai
∣∣∣∣ θi ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , N,
N∑
i=1
θi = 1
}
. (2)
The immediate implication to the hyperspectral mixing model (1) is that every observed pixel vector
x[n] lies in the endmember affine hull aff{a1, . . . ,aN}, due to (A2). The affine hull aff{a1, . . . ,aN}
can always be represented by
aff{a1, . . . ,aN} =
{
x = Cα+ d
∣∣ α ∈ RP} (3)
for some (C,d) ∈ RM×P × RM and rank(C) = P , where P is the affine dimension. Under (A3), the
affine dimension P is N − 1. We have shown [33], [34] that (C,d) in (3) can be identified from the
observed pixel vectors {x[1], . . . ,x[L]}, as stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. (Affine set fitting [33], [34]) Under (A2) and (A3), the affine set fitting parameter (C,d)
in (3) can be obtained from {x[1], . . . ,x[L]} by
d =
1
L
L∑
n=1
x[n], (4)
C = [ q1(HH
T ), q2(HH
T ), . . . , qN−1(HH
T ) ], (5)
where H = [ x[1]−d, . . . ,x[L]−d ] ∈ RM×L, and qi(R) denotes the unit-norm eigenvector associated
with the ith principal eigenvalue of R.
Affine set fitting in Lemma 1 provides a way of dimension reduction. Since x[n] ∈ {x = Cα+d ∣∣ α ∈
R
N−1
}
and C is semi-unitary, one can affinely transform each observed pixel vector x[n] by
x˜[n] = CT (x[n]− d) ∈ RN−1. (6)
Substituting (1) into (6), we get
x˜[n] =

III. FORMULATION OF WINTER’S ENDMEMBER EXTRACTION BELIEF
In 1999, Winter [15] proposed an endmember extraction belief that has now attracted much interest. In
that work, it was believed that the ground truth endmembers can be located by finding a collection of pixel
vectors whose simplex volume is the largest. Following the hyperspectral signal geometry derivations in
the last section, we herein formulate Winter’s belief in form of continuous optimization. As will be seen,
this endeavor will provide many implications. Our continuous optimization formulation of Winter’s belief
is as follows:
max
ν1,...,νN∈RN−1
vol(ν1, . . . ,νN )
s.t. νi ∈ conv{x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]}, i = 1, . . . , N.
(13)
Problem (13), which we will name the Winter problem in the sequel, is to find an N -tuple (ν1, . . . , νN )
from the pixel-constructed convex hull such that the associated simplex volume is maximized. A picture
is used to illustrate this in Figure 2. It should be noted that in Winter’s original work, each endmember
estimate νj is restricted to be any vector in {x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]}.
With the Winter criterion formulated in (13), the first question we wish to pin down is endmember
identifiability: Under the noiseless model, is the Winter problem (13) able to perfectly identify the ground
truth {α1, . . . ,αN}, and, if yes, what are the underlying conditions? This is addressed in the following
theorem:
Theorem 1. (Endmember identifiability for Winter’s belief) Suppose that noise is absent, and that
(A1) − (A3) hold. Then, the optimal solution of (13), denoted by {ν?1 , . . . ,ν?N}, is uniquely given by
{α1, . . . ,αN} if and only if (A4) is true.

output (νˆ1, . . . , νˆN ) as an approximate solution to (14).
There is a basic convergence result for alternating optimization [39]: Suppose that f is continuously
differentiable, that each Fi is a closed convex set, and that each partial maximization problem has a
unique solution. Then, (νˆ1, . . . , νˆN ) converges to a stationary point of Problem (14) for the number of
alternating cycles approaching infinity.
B. Alternating Optimization for the Winter Problem
Now, let us consider using alternating optimization to handle the Winter problem (13). By (9) and
(10), we can explicitly express Problem (13) as
max
ν1,...,νN∈RN−1
|det(∆(ν1, . . . ,νN ))|
s.t. νi ∈ F , i = 1, . . . , N,
(15)
where
F = {ν ∈ RN−1 | ν = X˜θ, θ  0, 1TLθ = 1} (16)
is the convex hull of x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L], and X˜ = [ x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L] ]. Notice that F is closed convex. Another
property of Problem (15) is that the optimal solutions of (15) are order invariant; i.e., if (ν?1 , . . . ,ν?N )
is an optimal solution of (15), then (ν?pi1 , . . . ,ν?piN ), for any permutation index set {pi1, . . . , piN}, is also
optimal to (15). Moreover, by the basic matrix result that det(E) = −det(B) if B results from E by
interchanging any two columns, an optimal solution of (15) in which det(∆(ν?1 , . . . ,ν?N )) ≥ 0 always

Step 3. calculate bj = [(−1)i+jdet(V ij)]N−1i=1 , where Vij is a submatrix of
∆(νˆ1, . . . , νˆN ) with the ith row and jth column removed.
Step 4. update νˆj := x˜[`] for any ` = argn=1,...,Lmax bTj x˜[n].
Step 5. if (j modulo N) 6= 0,
then j := j + 1 and go to Step 3,
else
update Nitr := Nitr + 1, and compute %¯ = det(∆(νˆ1, . . . , νˆN )).
if |%¯− %|/% > ε, then set % := %¯, j := 1, and go to Step 3.
Step 6. output (νˆ1, . . . , νˆN ) as an approximate solution to (15).
Remark 1. AVMAX turns out to have much in common with the N-FINDR algorithms [15], [18],
[20], in that both AVMAX and N-FINDR attempt to maximize the simplex volume by employing some
forms of one-at-a-time pixel search. AVMAX is particularly similar to one specific form of N-FINDR,
namely NSS-N-FINDR [20], where the pseudo code of AVMAX in Table I becomes that of NSS-N-
FINDR if we replace Step 4 by νˆj = x˜[`] for any ` = argmaxn=1,...,L |bTj x˜[n] + (−1)N+jdet(VNj)|
and restrict the total number of alternating cycles Nitr equal to one in Step 5.
Remark 2. While AVMAX turns out to be a pixel search method, it is a consequence of alternating
optimization for a continuously differentiable problem with a closed convex feasible set. By the
convergence result of alternating optimization [39] mentioned in the previous subsection, we come to
an interesting conclusion that the AVMAX method converges to a stationary point of Winter’s problem
(17) under the mild assumption of unique solution for each partial maximization problem (18).
In the previous section, we have proven the endmember identifiability of the Winter optimization
problem. However, it does not imply that an algorithm derived from the Winter problem can always
achieve that identifiability result, since the Winter problem may have local minima; in other words,
endmember identifiability of a Winter-based algorithm and that of the Winter problem can be two different
issues. For AVMAX, we show that the endmember identifiability is the same as that promised by the
problem itself (in Theorem 1).

where F = {w ∈ RN | w = [νT 1]T , ν ∈ F}, with F having been defined in (16). The set F can be
alternatively represented by
F = {w ∈ RN | w = Xθ, θ  0, 1TLθ = 1}, (27)
where x¯[n] = [x˜[n]T 1]T and X = [x¯[1], . . . , x¯[L]].
We can decompose the objective function of (26) in the successive form in (25). To do so, we derive
the following general matrix lemma:
Lemma 4. Let Y = [y1, . . . ,yN ] ∈ RM×N . It holds true that√
det(YTY) = ‖y1‖2
∥∥∥P⊥Y1:1y2∥∥∥2 · · ·
∥∥∥P⊥Y1:(N−1)yN∥∥∥2 , (28)
where Y1:j = [y1, . . . ,yj ], and P⊥Y1:j = IM − Y1:j(YT1:jY1:j)†YT1:j is the orthogonal complement
projector of Y1:j .
Proof: The proof of Lemma 4 is given in Appendix D.
Since |det(Y)| =
√
det(YTY) for square Y, Lemma 4 can be used to decompose the objective
function of Problem (26). Subsequently, we have the following successive optimization process for the
Winter problem:
wˆ1 =arg max

The successive maximizations above are nonconvex. Fortunately, we show that they can be easily solved:
Lemma 5. The partial maximizer in (29a) has an analytical solution wˆ1 = x¯[`] for any ` ∈ arg
maxn=1,...,L ‖x¯[n]‖2. Moreover, the partial maximizer in (29b) has an analytical solution wˆj = x¯[`] for
any ` ∈ arg maxn=1,...,L ‖P⊥
Wˆ1:(j−1)
x¯[n]‖2.
Proof: The proof of Lemma 5 is given in Appendix E.
We name the successive optimization procedure developed above the successive volume maximization
(SVMAX) method. Table II provides a summary of the SVMAX method in pseudo-code form. An
important remark is as follows:
Remark 3. As a surprising coincidence, SVMAX has striking similarities to the VCA algorithm [23].
The notably similar part lies in the result in Lemma 5: If we replace the index selection in Lemma 5 by

3(a) to illustrate such a possible instance. Our idea of mitigating such effects is to keep the endmember
estimates ν1, . . . ,νN away from the boundary of the pixel-constructed convex hull conv{x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]}
by some distance, thereby attempting to bring (ν1, . . . ,νN ) closer to the ground truth (α1, . . . ,αN ). A
picture illustrating this idea is shown in Figure 3(b); in the figure the circles located at the corners of
conv{x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]} represent the maximum backoff regions of ν1, . . . ,νN .
We formulate the above proposed belief as an optimization problem, given as follows:

(30)
where each ui ∈ RN−1, i = 1, . . . , N is an error vector that lies in a norm ball {u ∈ RN−1 | ‖u‖2 ≤ r},
with the given radius r. By letting (v?1, . . . ,v?N ,u?1, . . . ,u?N ) denote the outer-inner solution of (30), the
robust Winter endmember estimates are ν?i = v?i − u?i , i = 1, . . . , N .
Physically speaking, our formulated problem in (30) takes on a worst-case robust strategy. The newly
incorporated vectors u1, . . . ,uN are used to enforce the backoffs of ν1, . . . ,νN in a worst-case simplex
volume sense, while the radius r represents how much backoff of ν1, . . . ,νN is allowed. In other words,
the value r is also a sort of measure that quantifies the desired robustness against noise. As a rule of
thumb, one should increase r when the noise variance, or the magnitude of the noise perturbations,
increases.

ϕ(θj , Θˆj) is concave w.r.t. θj [37] due to the pointwise infimum property1. However, Problem (35) is still
difficult to handle due to the fact that ϕ(θj , Θˆj) does not have a closed form and is non-differentiable.
Next, we will concentrate on dealing with Problem (35).
2) Projected subgradient method for (35): In the optimization literature, there are methods available
for solving non-differentiable convex problems, and those include the subgradient methods, cutting plane
methods, and ellipsoid methods [39]. Here, we employ the projected subgradient method to deal with (35),
due to its relative implementation simplicity. The projected subgradient method for (35) is as follows.
The basic idea of the projected subgradient method is to generate a sequence of points according to
the following iteration
θ
(k+1)
j =
{
θ
(k)
j − γkg(k)
}
S
(36)
where g(k) is a subgradient of −ϕ(θj , Θˆj) at θ(k)j , γk is the step size, k is the current iteration number,
and {x}S = argminθ∈S ‖x−θ‖2 denotes the projection of x onto S . The projected subgradient method
keeps track of the best solution found; i.e., at each iteration we update
ϕ
(k+1)
best = max
{
ϕ
(k)
best, ϕ(θ
(k+1)
j , Θˆj)
}
(37)
and update θˆj = θ(k+1)j if ϕ
(k+1)
best = ϕ(θ
(k+1)
j , Θˆj). As a key property, the projected subgradient method
can converge to the optimal objective value for certain kinds of step size sequences; e.g., the diminishing
step size sequence γk = γ/
√
k for some γ > 0 [39].
The projection onto the simplex {x}S can be efficiently implemented by a waterfilling-type algorithm
[40]. The subgradients for −ϕ(θj , Θˆj) can be computed as follows. By Danskin’s theorem [39], a
subgradient of −ϕ(θj , Θˆj) at θj is given by
g = −X˜Tbj(U?), (38)
where U? = [u?1, . . . ,u?N ] is the optimal solution of the inner problem of (33) given by
(u?1, . . . ,u
?
N ) = arg min
‖ui‖2≤r,
i=1,...,N
det(∆(X˜θˆ1 − u1, . . . , X˜θˆN − uN )). (39)
The above problem is nonconvex, but can be approximated by alternating optimization in the same spirit
as AVMAX. The partial minimization problem of (39) w.r.t. uj can be expressed as
min
‖uj‖2≤r
kTj (X˜θˆj − uj) + (−1)N+jdet(UNj), (40)
1Let Y be a nonempty continuous set. The pointwise infimum property states that if f(x,y) is concave in x for any y ∈ Y ,
then g(x) = infy∈Y f(x,y) is concave in x.

B. Monte Carlo Simulations for Various Number of Pixels
The synthetic data were generated in the same manner as in Section VII-A, where the SNR fixed at 15
dB and the number of pixels varies from 250 to 8000. The average φ and T of the endmember extraction
methods for the synthetic data sets with different L are shown in Table VI. The error tolerance r for
WAVMAX is the same as that in Section VII-A for SNR=15 dB. One can see that for all the values of
L under test, WAVMAX outperforms all the other algorithms, and SVMAX spent less computation time
T than the others. Moreover, the number of iterations Nitr of N-FINDR slightly increases as L becomes
larger while that of AVMAX and WAVMAX seems independent of L.
C. Monte Carlo Simulations for Various Number of Endmembers
Again, the synthetic data were generated in the same manner as in Section VII-A, where SNR is set to
15 dB and the N endmembers varying from 4 to 14 are randomly picked from USGS library [42]. The

identifiability of AVMAX and SVMAX in the absence of noise, and the convergence of AVMAX to
a stationary point. In addition, we have also established a worst-case Winter’s endmember extraction
problem with the aim of accounting for the presence of noise in hyperspectral data, and have proposed a
worst-case AVMAX algorithm using a combination of alternating optimization and projected subgradients.
Some simulation results were presented to demonstrate the comparable performance of the AVMAX
and SVMAX algorithms with some existing benchmark endmember extraction algorithms, the superior
performance of the WAVMAX algorithm for finite SNRs, and the lower computational complexity of the
SVMAX algorithm than the benchmark methods.

C. Proof of Lemma 3.
Consider Step 4 in Table I for j = 1. Under the assumption that the solution of each alternating
maximizer is unique, we have
νˆ1 = x˜[`], ` = argn=1,...,Lmax b¯
T
1 x¯[n], (48)
where b¯1 = [bT1 (−1)N+jdet(VN1)]T and x¯[n] = [x˜[n]T 1]T . Recall that x¯[n] =
∑N
i=1 si[n]α¯i and
α¯i = [α
T
i 1]

. Then, we can infer from (48) and assumptions (A1) and (A2) that

n
N∑
i=1
si[n] b¯

1 α¯i ≤ max
i=1,...,N
b¯T1 α¯i. (49)
Assume w.l.o.g. that b¯T1 α¯1 = maxi=1,...,N b¯T1 α¯i. By the solution uniqueness in (48), it can be easily
verified that the equality in (49) holds if and only if νˆ1 = x˜[`] = α1. Next, consider j ≥ 2. Since b¯Tj is
the jth row vector of the adjoint matrix of ∆(α1, . . . ,αj−1, νˆj , . . . , νˆN ) [38], it satisfies
b¯Tj α¯i = 0, i = 1, . . . , j − 1, (50)
due to adj(B)B = det(B)I where adj(B) is the adjoint matrix of a square matrix B. Hence, it follows
from (50) and the assumptions (A1) and (A2) that

By employing the same proof above, we obtain, w.l.o.g., νˆj = x˜[`] = αj . The proof of Lemma 3 is
therefore complete. 
D. Proof of Lemma 4
To prove Lemma 4, we first provide the following lemma:
Lemma 7. Let A ∈ Rm×p, B ∈ Rm×q and C = [A B]. The orthogonal complement projector of C,
denoted by P⊥C, is identical to
P⊥C = P
⊥
B˜
P⊥A,
where B˜ = P⊥AB.
Proof: Let D = [A B˜]. As a basic result of matrix analysis, the range spaces of C and D are identical.
Thus, their orthogonal projectors are identical, i.e., PC = PD. Let us consider PD:
PD = D(D

It can be easily verified that the equality above is achieved if and only if θ = e` for any ` ∈
argmaxn=1,...,L ‖x¯[n]‖2. Hence, the solution wˆ1 = x¯[`] is arrived. The proof for (29b) is the same
as above, and hence is omitted for brevity. 
F. Proof of Lemma 6
Let α¯i = [αTi 1]T . By assumptions (A1) and (A2) and triangle inequality, we have

where the equality above holds if and only if n = ` such that x¯[`] = α¯i for any i ∈ argmaxk=1,...,N ‖α¯k‖2.
Assume w.l.o.g. that ‖α¯1‖ = maxi=1,...,N ‖α¯i‖2. Hence, we can obtain wˆ1 = α¯1. Next, consider j ≥ 2.
Suppose that Wˆ1:(j−1) = [α¯1, . . . , α¯j−1] are obtained. By ‖P⊥Wˆ1:(j−1) α¯i‖2 = 0 for all i < j, it holds that
‖P⊥
Wˆ1:(j−1)
x¯[n]‖2 ≤

where the equality holds if and only if n = ` such that x¯[`] = α¯i for any i ∈ argmaxk=j,...,N ‖P⊥
Wˆ1:(j−1)
α¯k‖2.
Using the same argument as above, we get wˆj = α¯j w.l.o.g. The proof of Lemma 6 is therefore complete.

N is the nth abundance vector comprising N fractional abundances
and L is the total number of observed pixel vectors.
EE algorithms aim to estimate the endmember signature matrix
A from the observed hyperspectral pixel vectors (or simply pixels)
x[1], . . . ,x[L], assuming that N is known a priori. The following
are the general assumptions in HU:
(A1) (Non-negativity condition) si[n] ≥ 0 ∀i, n.
(A2) (Full additivity condition) ∑N
i=1 si[n] = 1 ∀n.
(A3) min{L,M} ≥ N and A is of full column rank.
(A4) (Pure pixel assumption) There exists an index set
{l1, l2, . . . , lN}, such that x[li] = ai, for i = 1, . . . , N .
3. DIMENSION REDUCTION
Like many other HU algorithms [1], we begin with dimension reduc-
tion of the observed pixels. The affine set fitting procedure in [10] is
utilized for dimension reduction. The dimension-reduced pixel vec-
tors x˜[n] are obtained by the following affine transformation of x[n]:
x˜[n] = CT (x[n]− d) ∈ RN−1, (2)
where (C,d) is the affine set fitting solution given by
d =

C = [ q1(UU
T ), q2(UU
T ), . . . , qN−1(UU
T ) ], (4)
in which U = [ x[1]− d, . . . ,x[L]− d ] ∈ RM×L, and qi(UUT )
denotes the unit-norm eigenvector associated with the ith principal
eigenvalue of the matrix UUT . Further, due to (A2), and by substi-
tuting the signal model (1) into (2), we have
x˜[n] =
N∑
j=1
sj [n]αj , (5)
where
αj = C
T (aj − d) ∈ R
N−1 (6)
is the jth dimension-reduced endmember, by finding which, the cor-
responding aj can be obtained by aj = Cαj + d,∀j [10]. Also, it
follows from (5) that under (A4),
x˜[li] = αi, ∀i, (7)
and x˜[n] lies in the simplex [11] formed by α1, . . . ,αN [10].
4. SIMPLEX ESTIMATION BY PROJECTION
In this section, let us present the new EE algorithm, SIMPLE-Pro.
We begin by considering the p-norm of the dimension-reduced data
cloud X˜ = [ x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L] ]. By the triangle inequality, (A1), and
(A2), one can infer from (5) that for all n,
‖x˜[n]‖p ≤
N∑
i=1
si[n]‖αi‖p ≤ max
i=1,...,N
{‖αi‖p}, (8)
where p ≥ 1. The inequality in (8) holds with equality if and only if
n = li (a pure pixel index) for any i ∈ arg maxk=1,...,N{‖αk‖p}
(by (7)). Thus, a dimension-reduced endmember can be identified as
stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. Under (A1)-(A4), a dimension-reduced endmember can
be identified by
αi = x˜[li], (9)
for any li ∈ arg maxn=1,...,L{‖x˜[n]‖p}.

α3 = x˜[l3], l3 ∈ arg minn{x˜[n]
Td?}
Fig. 1. Illustration of SIMPLE-Pro for N = 3. Assume that α1 and
α2 have been found. The vector d? is orthogonal to the affine hull of
α1 and α2 and the third endmember is found as α3 = x˜[l3], where
l3 ∈ arg minn=1,...,L{x˜[n]
Td?}.
Now, suppose that the dimension-reduced endmembers
α1, . . . ,αk (where k < N ) are already identified. To find the other
endmembers, we consider the following optimization problem:
min
d∈RN−1
‖d‖22 (10)
s.t. d ∈ aff{α1, . . . ,αk},
where aff{α1, . . . ,αk} is the affine hull of {α1, . . . ,αk}, defined
as [11]
aff{α1, . . . ,αk} =
{
x =
k∑
i=1
θiαi
∣∣∣∣ 1Tk θ = 1, θ ∈ Rk
}
, (11)
in which θ = [θ1, . . . , θk]T . Note that (10) is a quadratic convex
problem, and it can be easily shown that its closed-form solution is:
d
? = (I−BB†)αk = P
⊥
Bαk, (12)
where B = [α1 −αk, . . . ,αk−1 −αk] ∈ R(N−1)×(k−1) and P⊥B
is the orthogonal complement projector of B. By projecting all the
dimension-reduced data onto d?, and by (A1) and (A2), we have
x˜[n]Td? =
N∑
i=1
si[n]α
T
i d
? ≥ min
i=1,...,N
{αTi d
?}, (13)
and the inequality in (13) holds with equality if and only if n = lz
for any z ∈ arg mini{αTi d?}. The (k + 1)th dimension-reduced
endmember can then be found as αk+1 = x˜[lz] where
lz ∈ arg min
n=1,...,L
{x˜[n]Td?}. (14)
The above procedure is illustrated in Figure 1, for the N = 3 case.
Next, in the following lemma we show that x˜[lz] is different from
those endmember estimates already found.
Lemma 2. Suppose that {α1, . . . ,αk} is the set of endmembers
already found and d? is obtained by (12). Then, under (A1)-(A4),
x˜[lz] ∈ {αk+1, ...,αN} for any lz ∈ arg minn=1,...,L{x˜[n]Td?}.
Proof: It is well known that the projector P⊥B satisfies P⊥BB = 0,
implying

B(αq −αk) = 0, q = 1, . . . , k − 1. (15)

6. SIMULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The performance evaluation of the proposed two EE algorithms,
SIMPLE-Pro and TRI-P (with p = 2), by simulation is presented
in this section. Other EE algorithms that are compared are N-
FINDR, VCA, and SGA. The root-mean-square (rms) spectral angle
φen [7,10] between the true and the estimated endmember signatures
is used as the performance index. In the simulations the number of
endmembers is 12 (N = 12) and the number of observed pixels is
1000 (L = 1000). The endmember signatures are chosen from the
USGS library [12], and it has 224 bands (M = 224). In each run,
1000 noise-free observed pixel vectors were synthetically generated
following the signal model in (1), and the abundance vectors s[n]
were generated following Dirichlet distribution (as in [7]), for dif-
ferent purity levels ρ [10]. The noisy data were generated by adding
independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise to
the noise-free data for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where
SNR=
∑L
n=1 ‖x[n]‖
2
2/MLσ
2 and σ2 is the noise variance. For
each scenario 100 independent runs are performed and the average
φen (over 100 runs) and the average computation time Tc (over all
the scenarios under consideration) of each algorithm (implemented
in Matlab R2008a and running in a desktop computer equipped with
Dual Core CPU 2.80 GHz, 2 GB memory) are calculated, for differ-
ent purity levels (ρ = 0.6, 0.8, 1) and SNRs ranging from 0 dB to
40 dB, in steps of 5 dB.
The obtained simulation results are shown in Table 3. The bold-
faced numbers in Table 3 correspond to the minimum rms spectral
angle for a specific pair of (ρ, SNR), over all the algorithms under
test. It can be observed from Table 3 that although the performances
of all the EE algorithms are competitive, SIMPLE-Pro and TRI-P
still outperform the other algorithms in most of the scenarios. On
the other hand, the average computation times (Tcs) for SIMPLE-
Pro and TRI-P are almost the same and they are about 17 times, 3
times and 1.5 times smaller than that of N-FINDR, VCA, and SGA,
respectively. These simulation results demonstrate the efficacy and
computational efficiency of the proposed two EE algorithms.
In summary, we have presented two effective and computation-

MA et al.: A KHATRI–RAO SUBSPACE APPROACH 2169
In this paper, we propose a subspace approach to DF-QSS.
Our work is based on the assumptions that:
i) the sources are mutually uncorrelated and wide-sense
quasi-stationary;
ii) the noise is wide-sense stationary, but with an unknown,
possibly nonwhite, spatial covariance; and
iii) the sensor array exhibits a uniform linear structure.
Our idea is to exploit the subspace characteristics of the
time-variant second-order statistics (SOSs) of the quasi-sta-
tionary source signals. Since this development involves
subspace formed by the self Khatri–Rao (KR) product of the
array response, we call the proposed approach the KR subspace
approach. We should point out that the established KR sub-
space approach has its criterion different from the LSF and JD
criteria used in BSS-QSS. A meaningful result with the KR
subspace formulation is that for a physically underdetermined
problem, the DOA estimation problem under the KR subspace
can be ‘virtually overdetermined’ under some conditions. In
essence, our identifiability analysis proves that for a sensor
array of elements, the degree of freedom under the KR sub-
space formulation is . This translates into an advantage
that a KR subspace method can unambiguously identify up to
sources. This is a significant improvement, compared
to the conventional subspace SOS-based approach where the
limit is sources. The KR subspace approach is also
convenient to implement, since available subspace algorithms
or concepts (e.g., MUSIC1) can be carried forward at a certain
point of the KR formulation. In addition, the KR subspace
formulation provides a convenient way of removing the spatial
noise covariance matrix from the received signal SOSs, without
knowing the noise covariance. Thus, the KR subspace approach
is effective against spatially colored noise with unknown spatial
covariance. Moreover, we will propose a novel idea where the
KR problem dimension is reduced prior to the subspace pro-
cessing. This dimension reduction idea helps save complexity
in implementations, and it does so without losing the effective
degree of freedom of the virtual array.
Since the proposed KR subspace approach enables underde-
termined DOA estimation of quasi-stationary signals, it would
be appropriate to mention other existing underdetermined DOA
estimation approaches. Underdetermined DOA estimation is
possible when the source signals are non-Gaussian stationary,
and that necessitates the use of higher order statistics (HOSs).
In the HOS-DF approach [21]–[24], it has been discovered
that the higher order cumulants of the observed signals provide
a virtual array structure that coincides with the one found in
this paper when such cumulants are of fourth order. Neverthe-
less, the DF-QSS and HOS-DF approaches follow different
formulations and they target different signals and applications.
For speech signals, our simulation results will show that the
proposed DF-QSS approach yields better DOA estimation ac-
curacies than the HOS-DF approach (though it is fair to say that
we would expect to see the opposite for strongly non-Gaussian,
weakly quasi-stationary signals).
The development in this paper concentrates on the narrow-
band DOA estimation scenario. Using the frequency-domain
1MUSIC stands for multiple signal classification.
signal subspace processing methods [3]–[5], one can readily ex-
tend the proposed KR subspace approach to the wideband DOA
estimation scenario. The wideband extension is also consid-
ered and tested, where the simulation results will illustrate that
the proposed wideband KR subspace algorithm is successful in
identifying DOAs of real speech signals under underdetermined
environments.

II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
We will first describe the signal model and assumptions of
the DOA estimation problem considered in this paper. Then, we
will study the second-order statistics model of the problem.
A. Signal Model and Assumptions
Consider a scenario in which a number of narrowband
far-field sources are observed by a sensor array of elements.
The array is assumed to have a uniform linear array (ULA)
structure. We denote by the observed signal of the th
sensor, and the signal emitted by the th source. By letting
and ,
the received signal is modeled as
(1)
Here, represents the spatial noise,
is the array response matrix
where is the direction of arrival (DOA) of
source , and
(2)
denotes the steering vector function with and being the in-
tersensor spacing and the signal wavelength, respectively. Some
common assumptions are made as follows:
A1) The source signals , are mutually
uncorrelated and have zero-mean.
A2) The source DOAs , are distinct to one
another, i.e., for all .

It is interesting to note from (10) or (11) that is reminiscent
of an array signal model where is virtually
the array response matrix and the source signal vector. The
virtual array dimension, given by , is greater than the phys-
ical array dimension for , and that essentially provides
us with the capability of processing cases where there are less
sensors than sources. This will be shown in the ensuing devel-
opment.
We should note that each column of in (12) describes the
powers of the respective source signal with respect to frames, or
simply speaking, the long-term power profile over time. Let us
assume the following:
A5) The matrix is of full column
rank.
Assumption A5) physically implies the followings: First, the
source power distributions over the time frames (or the columns
of ) are different so that can maintain a full column rank
condition. Second, any linear combination of the sources cannot
result in a WSS source (i.e., for any coefficients ,
the signal cannot be WSS), otherwise can
be a linear combination of the columns of which violates
A5). While the necessary condition for fulfilling A5) is to have
, in practice it would be desirable to use a much
larger so as to obtain sufficient long-term source power vari-
ations to well satisfy A5). Certainly, availability of large
depends on applications. For example, for speech applications
where is generally proportional to a physical time duration of
20 to 25 ms, we can obtain more than 40 frames (or )
in 1 s. Moreover, increasing the value of would generally
be useful in improving the conditioning of . Hence, in the
presence of estimation errors in the local covariances , em-
ploying a larger would be helpful in suppressing the subse-
quent error effects.
Under A5), we can eliminate the unknown noise covariance
effectively and easily. The noise covariance elimination is done
by denoting an orthogonal complement projector
, and then by performing a projection
(13)
Under A5), we have . In other
words, the noise covariance elimination operation does not
damage the rank condition of the covariance model.
Now consider the subspaces of . For ease of exposition
of idea, we assume for the time being that is of full
column rank. We will soon provide conditions under which this
assumption is valid. When both and in (13)
have full column rank, we can have [27]
(14)
Denote the singular value decomposition (SVD) of by
(15)
where and are the left and right
singular matrices associated with the nonzero singular values,
respectively, and are
the left and right singular matrices associated with the zero sin-
gular values, respectively, and is a diagonal matrix
whose diagonals contain the nonzero singular values. Based on
the standard SVD result that
(16)
we know that the source DOAs satisfy
(17)
for . We hence propose the following KR subspace
criterion for DOA estimation of quasi-stationary sources
(18)
To satisfy the KR subspace criterion in (18), we can use the
idea of MUSIC in the conventional subspace-based DOA esti-
mation approach. The further details will be considered in the
next subsection.
Like the development in the subspace discipline, it is crucial
to determine conditions under which (18) is satisfied only if
is a true DOA, viz., the identifiability conditions. The following
two propositions provide the key results of the theoretical iden-
tifiability of the KR subspace approach.
Proposition 1: Under A2), the sufficient and necessary con-
dition for the virtual array response matrix to yield
full column rank (or simply ) is when
Proposition 2: Assume that A1)–A5) hold. The KR subspace
criterion in (18) is achieved by any one of the true angles
, if and only if
(19)
The proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 are given in Appendix B.
Simply speaking, the idea behind the proofs is to use the KR
product krank property in Property 2, and to have explicit ex-
position of the structures of . Proposition 1 justifies our
assumption in the KR subspace development above, and Propo-
sition 2 provides the identifiability condition of the KR subspace
criterion. In particular, Proposition 2 gives the appealing impli-
cation that DOA estimation can be done for underdetermined
cases under the KR subspace framework.
C. KR-Based DOA Estimators With Dimension Reduction
We could develop a KR-based DOA estimator by directly ap-
plying a subspace method (say, MUSIC) to the KR subspace
criterion (18). But, prior to applying a subspace method, we can
reduce the problem dimension as hinted in the proof of Propo-
sitions 1 and 2 in Appendix B.

TABLE II
GENERATION OF SYNTHETIC QUASI-STATIONARY SIGNALS
where and denote the true and estimated DOAs, respec-
tively. The first three simulation examples are based on the stan-
dard narrowband scenario, where the performance of the KR
subspace methods is examined under various conditions. We
also compared the KR subspace methods with some other ex-
isting methods, such as the standard MUSIC algorithm, and
a fourth-order cumulant based HOS-MUSIC algorithm called
4-MUSIC [21]–[23].
In the first three narrowband simulation examples, the quasi-
stationary source signals were synthetically generated by
a random generation procedure given in Table II. This proce-
dure generates a locally stationary zero-mean complex Lapla-
cian process, with the variances randomly varying from one
frame to another. Moreover, the duration of each local time
frame is randomly drawn following a uniform distribution
on . The purpose of doing so is to simulate a more
realistic situation where the local stationary periods are uncer-
tain and varying; e.g., in speech. Strictly speaking, such signals
violate A4) which assumes all local stationary intervals to be the
same and known. Nevertheless, the simulation results to be pre-
sented soon will show that the KR subspace approach is not too
sensitive to the effects of uncertain local stationary intervals.
In the last simulation example, we simulate a realistic wide-
band microphone array processing system with real speech sig-
nals employed as the sources.
A. Simulation Example 1: Underdetermined Narrowband
DOA Estimation
We consider a narrowband, underdetermined case where
. The true DOAs are
. The sensor array is uni-
form linear with . The SNR is 10 dB. The spatial
noise is zero-mean, uniformly white complex Gaussian.
The synthetic signal generation procedure in Table II is used
to generate the source signals , with allowable range of
the frame periods . In Fig. 1 we
illustrate a segment of the synthetic quasi-stationary signals.
Notice that the dashed lines in the figure mark the actual local
stationary intervals of the signals. As we can see, the frame
intervals of the 6 source signals are not uniform and not syn-
chronized. We apply the KR subspace methods by choosing
a fixed frame period of , which is approximately the
mean of the actual frame periods. The number of frames is set
to . Fig. 2(a) shows one realization of the KR-MUSIC
DOA spectrum. As seen, the peaks of the spectra are in good
agreement with the true DOAs. This also demonstrates that the

sources are locally complex Gaussian.
in Fig. 3(a), we found that the RMS angle errors of KR-MUSIC
and KR-Capon do not change with the distributions. This veri-
fies the distribution insensitivity of the KR-based methods.
C. Simulation Example 3: Narrowband DOA Estimation in the
Presence of Spatially Nonuniform and Nonwhite Noise
This simulation example considers a narrowband overdeter-
mined case where , and
where the true DOAs are given by
. We tried two kinds of noise models. The first is a spatially
nonuniform white complex Gaussian noise with covariance
(26)
With the other simulation settings being the same as Simula-
tion Example 1, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation for
KR-MUSIC, 4-MUSIC, and the conventional MUSIC algorithm
which can be applied in this overdetermined example. Fig. 5(a)
shows the performance of the various algorithms. We observe
that at high SNRs where the noise covariance becomes neg-
ligible, it is the conventional MUSIC algorithm that prevails.
However, at low SNRs, KR-MUSIC gives lower RMS estimation
errors than the conventional MUSIC. This verifies that the pro-
posed KR subspace approach is immune to the unknown noise
covariance effects. In fact, the conventional MUSIC is known to
be sensitive to colored or nonuniform spatial noise covariance
effects [28]. Fig. 5(a) also shows that 4-MUSIC is robust against
Gaussian noise with unknown noise covariance.
The second noise model we tested is a uniform, spatially col-
ored complex Gaussian noise with the th entry of the co-
variance given by
(27)
The results are shown in Fig. 5(b). We see that the performance
behaviors are the same as those of the previous noise model.
D. Simulation Example 4: Narrowband DOA Estimation of
Two Closely Spaced Sources
This example examines the performance of KR-MUSIC
when dealing with two closely spaced sources. We set

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper has addressed the DOA estimation problem of mu-
tually uncorrelated wide-sense quasi-stationary signals in the
presence of wide-sense stationary noise and with uniform linear
arrays. We have established a KR subspace approach that ju-
diciously utilizes the long-term time-variant characteristics of
quasi-stationary SOSs to achieve two advantages. First, the KR
subspace approach can be applied to cases where there are less
sensors than sources. Our theoretical identifiability analysis has
revealed that the proposed KR subspace approach can uniquely
identify the source DOAs when
where and denote the numbers of sources and sensors, re-
spectively. In addition, the approach can effectively cope with
the effects of wide-sense stationary noise with unknown covari-
ance. We have used synthetic signals and real speech signals
to perform a number of simulations, where the effectiveness of
the KR subspace approach has been successfully demonstrated
under various problem settings.
In essence, this paper has revealed how quasi-stationarity can
be utilized to provide advantages in DOA estimation. As a future

direction, it would be interesting to study how quasi-stationarity
may bring a difference to DOA estimation performance limits;
e.g., by exploring the Cramér–Rao lower bound in the quasi-sta-
tionary case. In addition, it would be interesting to perform a
theoretical analysis on the error performance of the KR sub-
space methods.

ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose a fast convergent method for blind channel
identification of quasi-stationary signals (BCI-QSS), with an em-
phasis on overdetermined linear mixtures. The proposed method
is based on the Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace criterion; this criterion
enables us to decouple the BCI-QSS problem into a number of per-
channel-column identification problems that exhibit a problem struc-
ture less complex than a full BCI-QSS problem. We propose a spe-
cialized alternating projections (AP) algorithm for handling those
per-channel-column problems. Interestingly, we prove that under an
ideal model condition, the proposed AP algorithm converges to a
true channel column almost surely, and it does so within one itera-
tion. Our simulation results show that the proposed method termi-
nates in 3 − 4 iterations on average when noise is present, and that
it achieves satisfactory channel estimation performance as compared
to some other existing BCI-QSS methods.

1. INTRODUCTION
This paper considers the problem of blind channel identification
(BCI) of quasi-stationary signals (QSS), termed BCI-QSS here for
short. In this context, the source signals are assumed to be station-
ary within local time intervals, but have time-varying statistics in a
global time scale. BCI-QSS finds applications in blind separation of
speech and audio signals, and it has received much interest. The idea
behind BCI-QSS is to exploit the inherent time-varying statistics
(usually the second-order statistics [SOSs]) of the sources to identify
the channel. BCI-QSS can be formulated as a data fitting problem
involving three-way arrays, popularly known as parallel factor analy-
sis (PARAFAC) [1–3]. Alternatively, one can formulate BCI-QSS as
a problem of diagonalizing multiple matrices; i.e., the so-called joint
diagonalization (JD) [4–6]. In devising a BCI-QSS method, under
either PARAFAC or JD, we are generally required to deal with some
kinds of four-order optimization with respect to the channel matrix
(or its inverse), and such problems are challenging to solve. Rep-
resentative algorithms under the PARAFAC framework include tri-
linear alternating least squares (TALS) [2] and alternating-columns
diagonal-centers (AC-DC) [3], while those under JD include Pham’s
diagonalization [4], fast Frobenius diagonalization (FFDiag) [5], and
quadratic diagonalization (QDiag) [6].
This work was supported by a General Research Fund of Hong Kong
Research Grant Council (Project No. CUHK415908) and by the National
Science Council (R.O.C.) under Grants NSC 99-2221-E-007-003-MY3 and
NSC 96-2628-E-007-003-MY3.
In this paper we propose a BCI-QSS method based on the
Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace formulation [7]. KR subspace is an al-
ternative to the PARAFAC and JD framework; the former is differ-
ent in the sense that it advocates decoupled channel estimation on a
column-by-column basis. A potential advantage with this is that the
resulting per-channel-column identification problem exhibits a less
complex problem structure than a full BCI-QSS problem. In [7] we
have utilized such an advantage to develop simple, efficient DOA es-
timators for QSS. This paper deals with the more challenging case of
BCI, with an emphasis on overdetermined mixtures. To this end, we
will propose a channel column identification method using alternat-
ing projections (AP) [8]. It will be shown that the AP method, when
aided by the prewhitening procedure, yields appealing convergence
results. In particular, we will prove that in the absence of modeling
errors, the AP method (with prewhitening) almost surely converges
to a true channel column in one iteration. A method that uses AP to
effectively identify all the channel columns will also be developed.
Our simulation results will demonstrate that in the presence of noise,
the proposed KR subspace AP algorithm still exhibits fast conver-
gence (3-4 iterations on average), while providing competitive BCI
performance as compared to some other BCI-QSS algorithms.
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider an N -by-K linear mixing model as follows:
x(t) = As(t) + v(t), t = 0, 1, 2, . . . (1)
where x(t) = [x1(t), . . . , xN(t)]T is the received signal vector,
A = [a1, . . . ,aK ] ∈ C
N×K is the channel matrix, s(t) =
[s1(t), . . . , sK(t)]
T is the source signal vector, and v(t) represents
noise. Our model assumptions are as follows:
(A1) The source signals sk(t), k = 1, . . . ,K, are zero-mean and
statistically independent of each other.
(A2) N > K, and A ∈ CN×K is of full column rank.
(A3) The noise vector v(t) is wide-sense stationary with zero mean
and covariance σ2I, and it is statistically independent of the
source signals.
(A4) Each source signal sk(t) is wide-sense quasi-stationary with
frame length L; specifically, E{|sk(t)|2} = dmk, ∀t ∈
[(m− 1)L+ 1, mL].
Note that assumption (A4) is key to BCI-QSS techniques [2–6].
Physically, it means that the source SOSs are static within a short,
local period of time, but are time-variant over a global time scale.
Let us examine the local SOSs of the received signal x(t). Let
Rm = E{x(t)x(t)
H}, for any t ∈ [(m− 1)L+ 1,mL], (2)
It can be easily verified that the solution to (15) is h =
UsU
H
s (αa
∗ ⊗ a). Moreover, the partial minimization w.r.t. (α, a)
min
|α|=1,‖a‖2=1
‖αa∗ ⊗ a− h‖2 (16)
also has a closed form. To show this, consider the objective function
of (16). We have, for any |α| = 1, ‖a‖2 = 1,
‖αa∗ ⊗ a− h‖2 = |α|2‖a∗ ⊗ a‖2 − 2Re{α∗(a∗ ⊗ a)Hh}+ ‖h‖2
= 1− 2Re{α∗aHvec−1(h)a}+ ‖h‖2 (17)
≥ 1− 2|aHvec−1(h)a|+ ‖h‖2 (18)
where (17) is due to (8). Note that equality in (18) holds when
α = exp(jφ(aHvec−1(h)a)) where φ(x) is the phase of x. More-
over, (18) is minimized when a equals a unit-norm eigenvector of
vec−1(h) associated with the eigenvalue of largest absolute value,
which we will denote by qmax(vec−1(h)). In summary, a =
qmax(vec
−1(h)), α = exp(jφ(aHvec−1(h)a)) serve as a solution
to (16). We summarize the AP method as follows:

2×K
, and an
initial point h ∈ R(Us).

α := exp(jφ(aHvec−1(h)a)),

∗ ⊗ a),
until a stopping criterion is satisfied.
output the vector a.
For general applications, AP may exhibit slow convergence.
Rather unexpectedly, we find that for semi-unitary A (i.e.,AHA =
I), the convergence of AP becomes dramatically different:
Theorem 1. (Convergence of AP for semi-unitaryA) Suppose
that A is semi-unitary, that the initialization is generated by
h = Usζ where ζ ∼ CN (0, I) (i.e., i.i.d. zero-mean unit variance
complex Gaussian), and that there is no modeling error in (4).
Then, with probability one and in one iteration, the AP algorithm
converges to any one of a1, . . . ,aK up to a scale factor.
Proof: It can be verified that for a semi-unitaryA, (A∗A) is also
semi-unitary. With this property, we can show that
Us = (A
∗ A)Γ (19)
for some unitary Γ ∈ CK×K . Let η = Γζ. Then, we have η ∼
CN (0, I). Subsequently, the initialization can be expressed as
h = Usζ = (A
∗ A)η. (20)
Let us consider the devectorization of h. Applying (7) to (20) yields
vec−1(h) = ADiag(η)AH (21)
Since A is semi-unitary, the right hand side of (21) is in fact an
eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of vec−1(h). The remaining ques-
tion is whether (21) is the unique EVD. If it does, then the AP
step a := qmax(vec−1(h)) will pick up a principal eigenvector of
vec−1(h), which is one of the ak up to a scale factor. It is known
that if the eigenvalues η1, . . . , ηK are distinct, then the respective
EVD is unique. As ηi = ηj holds with probability zero for any
i 6= j, we assert that the AP algorithm almost surely converges to a
true channel column in its first iteration. 
5. KR SUBSPACE AP-BASED ALGORITHM
We now consider building a complete BCI-QSS algorithm, by taking
advantage of rapid convergence of AP shown in Theorem 1. Theo-
rem 1 applies to semi-unitary A only. While the channel matrix A
is not semi-unitary in general, we can enforce that by prewhitening.
The prewhitening process is as follows. Let
R¯ ,
1
M
M∑
m=1
Rm = AD¯A
H (22)
be the time-average covariance matrix, where D¯ = 1
M
∑M
m=1Dm.
We perform a square root factorization on R¯ (e.g., EVD) to obtain
R¯ = BBH , where B ∈ CN×K . Then, we carry out the following
prewhitening procedure on R1, . . . ,RM :
R˜m = B
†
Rm(B
†)H , m = 1, . . . ,M. (23)
where B† is the pseudo-inverse of B. Then, it can be shown that
R˜m = GD˜mG
H , m = 1, . . . ,M, (24)
where D˜m = D¯−1Dm, and G ∈ CK×K is unitary and satisfies
G = B†AD¯1/2. (25)
Hence, we can apply AP on R˜1, . . . , R˜M to obtain the columns of
G. Once the wholeG is identified, we estimate the original channel
matrix by BG; cf., (25).
As a side product of prewhitening, we can efficiently iden-
tify all the columns of G by exploiting its column orthogo-
nality. Suppose that we have identified gr . Let G−r =
[g1, . . . , gr−1,gr+1, . . . ,gK ]. It can be easily shown that
R(G∗−r G−r) = R
(
P
⊥
g∗
r
⊗gr (G
∗ G)
)
= R
(
P

r
⊗grUs
)
whereP⊥g∗
r
⊗gr = I− (g
∗
r ⊗ gr)(g
∗
r ⊗ gr)
H is the orthogonal com-
plement projector of g∗r ⊗ gr . By applying AP on P⊥g∗
r
⊗grUs, we
can identify another gi, i 6= r.
We finish this section by providing the complete pseudo-code of
the proposed KR subspace algorithm in Table 1.

Talk A: A Linear Fractional Semidefinite Relaxation Approach to 
Maximum-Likelihood Detection of Higher Order QAM OSTBC in Unknown Channels  
 
Abstract: While the blind maximum-likelihood (ML) detection problem in multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) flat-fading channels for general space-time codes is difficult to solve, it has 
been shown that for orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) with constant modulus 
constellations, this problem can be formulated as a discrete quadratic program, and then handled by a 
powerful convex approximation technique known as semidefinite relaxation (SDR). In this talk, we 
turn our attention to the case of higher order QAM OSTBCs. Due to the nonconstant modulus nature 
of higher order QAM signals, the blind ML detection problem turns out to be a discrete Rayleigh 
quotient maximization problem, and as a result the current SDR technique is no longer directly 
applicable. We present a linear fractional SDR (LFSDR) approach to this problem. This approach 
first relaxes the higher order QAM blind ML detection problem into a quasiconvex problem, 
followed by a simple solution approximation procedure. In general, quasiconvex problems are 
computationally more complex to solve than convex problems, but we show that an optimum 
solution of our quasiconvex problem can be efficiently obtained by solving a convex semidefinite 
program.

transmitter, a legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR), we present a multi-stage 
training-based discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme that aims to optimize the channel 
estimation performance of the LR while limiting the channel estimation performance of the UR. The 
key idea is to exploit the channel estimate fed back from the LR at the beginning of each stage to 
enable the judicious use of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal. Specifically, with knowledge of 
the LR’s channel, AN can be properly superimposed with the training data to degrade the UR’s 
channel without causing strong interference on the LR. The channel estimation performance of the 
LR in earlier stages may not be satisfactory due to the inaccuracy of the channel estimate and 
constraints on the UR’s estimation performance, but can improve rapidly in later stages as the quality 
of channel estimate improves. The training data power and AN power are optimally allocated by 
minimizing the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of the LR subject to a lower limit constraint 
on the NMSE of the UR. The presented DCE scheme is then extended to the case with multiple LRs 
and multiple URs. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
DCE scheme.

题目 2：Training Sequence Design for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in 
Wireless MIMO Systems （无线MIMO系统差异信道估计中的训练序列设计） 
报告人：Chong-Yung Chi (祁忠勇)教授 
This talk presents a training-based channel estimation scheme for achieving quality-of-service discrimination 
between legitimate and unauthorized receivers in wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. This 
scheme has applications ranging from user discrimination in wireless TV broadcast systems to the prevention of 
eavesdropping in secret communications. By considering a wireless MIMO system that consists of a 
multiple-antenna transmitter, a legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR), we present a 
multi-stage training-based discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme that aims to optimize the channel 
estimation performance of the LR while limiting the channel estimation performance of the UR. The key idea is to 
exploit the channel estimate fed back from the LR at the beginning of each stage to enable the judicious use of 
artificial noise (AN) in the training signal. Specifically, with knowledge of the LR’s channel, AN can be properly 
superimposed with the training data to degrade the UR’s channel without causing strong interference on the LR. 
The channel estimation performance of the LR in earlier stages may not be satisfactory due to the inaccuracy of the 
channel estimate and constraints on the UR’s estimation performance, but can improve rapidly in later stages as 
the quality of channel estimate improves. The training data power and AN power are optimally allocated by 
minimizing the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of the LR subject to a lower limit constraint on the NMSE 
of the UR. The presented DCE scheme is then extended to the case with multiple LRs and multiple URs. 
Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCE scheme.

more power efficient than that without AN, in discriminating Bob
and Eves’ reception performances.
2. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider a wireless downlink system that consists of a transmitter
(Alice), a legitimate receiver (Bob) and 𝑀 unauthorized receivers
(Eves). We assume that Alice is equipped with𝑁𝑡 transmit antennas,
and both Bob and Eves are equipped with only one receive antenna.
Let x(𝑡) ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 denote the signal vector transmitted from Alice, and
let h ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 and 𝒈𝑚 ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 denote the channel vectors from Alice
to Bob and from Alice to the 𝑚th Eve, respectively. The received
signals at Bob and Eves can be expressed as
𝑦𝑏(𝑡) = h
𝐻
x(𝑡) + 𝑛(𝑡), (1)
𝑦𝑒,𝑚(𝑡) = 𝒈
𝐻
𝑚x(𝑡) + 𝑣𝑚(𝑡), 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀, (2)
where 𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑣𝑚(𝑡) are the additive noise at Bob and Eve 𝑚,
respectively. They are assumed to be independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean, complex Gaussian random variables
with variances equal to 𝜎2𝑛 and 𝜎
2
𝑣,𝑚, respectively.
The aim of Alice is to design the transmit signal vector x(𝑡) ∈
ℂ𝑁𝑡 such that Bob can retrieve the information signal with a desired
quality of service (QoS) while all Eves can only have limited recep-
tion performance. Taking the received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
(or the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) if
interference are also present) as the QoS measure, QoS discrimina-
tion can be achieved via transmit beamforming [9], that is, by letting
x(𝑡) = 𝒘𝑠(𝑡) where 𝒘 ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 is the beamforming vector and 𝑠(𝑡)
is the information signal. Assuming that 𝑠(𝑡) has unit variance, one
can show by (1) and (2) that the SNRs at Bob and Eves are respec-
tively given by
SNR𝑏 = 𝒘
𝐻
Rℎ𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑛, SNR𝑒,𝑚 = 𝒘
𝐻
R𝑔,𝑚𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑣,𝑚, (3)
whereRℎ = hh𝐻 andR𝑔,𝑚 = 𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚 if the instantaneous CSIs of
Bob and Eves are available to Alice; whileRℎ = E{hh𝐻} ર 0 and
R𝑔,𝑚 = E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} ર 0 (here𝑿 ર 0 means that𝑿 is Hermitian
positive semidefinite (PSD)) if only the channel correlation matrices
are known to Alice. Hence, with target SNR values 𝛾𝑏 for Bob and
𝛾𝑒 for Eves (𝛾𝑏 > 𝛾𝑒), one can design the beamforming vector𝒘 by
considering the following optimization problem
𝑃 ★ = min
𝒘∈ℂ𝑁𝑡
∥𝒘∥2 (4a)
subject to (s.t.) 𝒘𝐻Rℎ𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑛 ≥ 𝛾𝑏, (4b)
𝒘
𝐻
R𝑔,𝑚𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑣,𝑚 ≤ 𝛾𝑒, 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀. (4c)
We should mention that the same design formulation as in (4) has
been used in transmit beamforming for spectrum sharing in cogni-
tive radios [9], a different application. Problem (4) is in general
a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, but interestingly when
Rℎ = hh
𝐻 (i.e., Alice perfectly knows Bob’s CSI) problem (4) can
be recast as a convex quadratic program as follows (see, e.g., [10]):
min
𝒘∈ℂ𝑁𝑡
∥𝒘∥2 (5a)
s.t. Real{h𝐻𝒘} ≥
√
𝛾𝑏 𝜎2𝑛, Im{h𝐻𝒘} = 0, (5b)
𝒘
𝐻
R𝑔,𝑚𝒘 ≤ 𝛾𝑒𝜎2𝑣,𝑚, 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀, (5c)
where Real{h𝐻𝒘} and Im{h𝐻𝒘} denote the real and imaginary
parts of h𝐻𝒘.
The design formulation in (4) depends on the degree of freedoms
(DOFs) of multiple antennas (which is 𝑁𝑡) in discriminating Bob
and Eves’ SNRs. Therefore, when 𝑀 is comparable to 𝑁𝑡 or when
the target SNR ratio 𝛾𝑏/𝛾𝑒 is set too high, the beamformer 𝒘 has
to spend most of its DOFs in fulfilling (4c), but leaves very limited
number of DOFs for directing the main beam power toward Bob. In
that case, the optimum𝒘★ of problem (4) inevitably require to scale
up the transmit power ∥𝒘★∥2 in order to meet Bob’s SNR demand
in (4b).
3. PROPOSED TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING USING
ARTIFICIAL NOISE
In the section, we propose a new transmit beamforming strategy by
incorporating artificial noise (AN) into signal transmission design.
We will show how the associated beamforming problem can be effi-
ciently handled by the SDP relaxation method [7].
3.1. Proposed Beamforming Strategy Using AN
We propose to increase the interference level at Eves by incorporat-
ing AN [5] in the transmit beamforming design. In the AN-aided
approach, the transmit signal x(𝑡) is modified as
x(𝑡) = 𝒘𝑠(𝑡) + z(𝑡), (6)
where
z(𝑡) ∼ 𝒞𝒩 (0,Σ), (7)
that is, z(𝑡) follows the zero-mean complex Gaussian distribution
with covariance matrix Σ ર 0. Under the AN-aided setting in (6),
we can deduce from the models in (1) and (2) that the SINRs at Bob
and Eves are
SINR𝑏=
𝒘𝐻Rℎ𝒘
Tr(RℎΣ) + 𝜎2𝑛
, SINR𝑒,𝑚=
𝒘𝐻R𝑔,𝑚𝒘
Tr(R𝑔,𝑚Σ) + 𝜎2𝑣,𝑚
, (8)
respectively, and the average transmit power is given by
E{∥x(𝑡)∥2} = ∥𝒘∥2 + Tr(Σ), (9)
where Tr(⋅) denotes the trace of a matrix. While the SINR𝑏 in (8)
seems degraded compared to the SNRs in (3) due to the added AN,
by joint design of the beamforming vector 𝒘 and AN covariance
matrix Σ, we shall be able to alleviate the degradation and in the
meantime effectively enhance the performance discrimination be-
tween Bob and Eves. Following the power minimization criterion
in (4), the design formulation for the AN-aided case is as follows:
𝑃 ★AN = min
𝒘,Σ
∥𝒘∥2 +Tr(Σ) (10a)
s.t.
𝒘𝐻Rℎ𝒘
Tr(RℎΣ) + 𝜎2𝑛
≥ 𝛾𝑏, (10b)
𝒘𝐻R𝑔,𝑚𝒘
Tr(R𝑔,𝑚Σ) + 𝜎2𝑣,𝑚
≤ 𝛾𝑒, 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀, (10c)
Σ ર 0. (10d)
A benefit that we can immediately see from (10) is that 𝑃 ★AN ≤
𝑃 ★; i.e., the proposed formulation (10) is more power efficient than
its no-AN counterpart (4), given the same specifications of 𝛾𝑏 and
𝛾𝑒. The reason for this is that the feasible set of problem (4), together
with Σ = 0, is merely a subset of the feasible set of (10). Problem
(10) is more difficult to handle than (4), however. In particular, one
can check that, unlike problem (4), problem (10) does not admit a
convex reformulation as in (5) whenRℎ = hh𝐻 . However, we will
present next that problem (10) can be efficiently handled by the SDP
relaxation technique [7].

𝐻 and R𝑔,𝑚 =
𝒈𝑚𝒈
𝐻
𝑚 for all 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3.
As the final simulation example, we considered problems (4) and
(10) withRℎ = hh𝐻 andR𝑔,𝑚 = E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} for 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3; i.e.,
Alice has the perfect Alice-to-Bob CSI but only knows the correla-
tion matrices of Alice-to-Eves channels. The channel vector h was
complex Gaussian distributed 𝒞𝒩 (0, I𝑁𝑡/𝑁𝑡) and the covariance
matrices E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} were given by
E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} = 𝛼 ¯𝑚¯
𝐻
𝑚
∣∣¯𝑚∣∣2 + (1− 𝛼)Λ, 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3, (16)
where ¯𝑚 ∼ 𝒞𝒩 (0, I𝑁𝑡 ), [Λ]𝑖,𝑗 = 0.1∣𝑖−𝑗∣/𝑁𝑡 specifies the de-
gree of correlation between transmit antennas, and 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1] was
used to control the level of uncertainty of channel coefficients. In
this particular example, we found that problem (4) or problem (10)
may be infeasible (or have no solution) sometimes, especially if the
given problem instances Rℎ,R𝑔,1, . . .R𝑔,𝑀 are harsh. In Fig. 3,
we present the percentage of infeasibility (%) of problems (4) and
(10) out of 1000 simulation trials for 𝛾𝑒 = 3 dB. One can see from
the figure that for 𝛼 = 0.8 and 1/𝜎2𝑣 ≥ 10 dB problem (4) has
about 30% infeasibility rate, and it can increase to about 55% for
𝛼 = 0.6. The proposed problem (10) by contrast is always feasible
for both 𝛼 = 0.6 and 𝛼 = 0.8. The presented simulation results well
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming strategy
in power consumption as well as in feasibility.

the endmember signature matrix whose ith column vector ai is the
ith endmember signature, s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T ∈ RN is the
nth abundance vector comprising N fractional abundances, w[n] =
[ w1[n], . . . , wM [n] ]
T is the zero-mean white Gaussian noise vector
(i.e.,N (0, σ2IM ), where σ2 is the noise variance) and L is the total
number of observed pixel vectors.
The goal of hyperspectral unmixing is to estimate the endmem-
ber signature matrix A and the abundances s[1], . . . , s[L] from the
noisy observed pixels y[1], . . . ,y[L], assuming that the number of
endmembers N is known a priori.
We consider the following general assumptions that are applica-
ble to HU algorithms :
(A1) (Non-negativity condition) si[n] ≥ 0 ∀ i, n.
(A2) (Full additivity condition)   Ni=1 si[n] = 1 ∀ n.
(A3) min{L,M} ≥ N and A is of full column rank.
(A1) and (A2) are valid assumptions in hyperspectral imaging
because the abundances are fractional proportions [1–4]. In addition,
the number of pixels and that of spectral bands involved are larger
than the number of endmembers and each endmember has its unique
signature, which justifies (A3).
Before getting into the core of development, we need to describe
a basic, essential concept in MVES, namely convex hull and simplex
[9]. Given a set of vectors {a1, . . . , aN} ⊂ RM , the convex hull of
{a1, . . . , aN} is defined as
conv{a1, . . . , aN} =  x =
N

Nθ = 1, θ  0  , (3)
where θ = [ θ1, . . . , θN ]T ∈ RN . In addition, a convex
hull conv{a1, . . . , aN} is called a simplex if M = N − 1 and
a1, . . . , aN are affinely independent.
3. REVIEW OF MVES PROBLEM FORMULATION
The noise-free signal model given by (2) is considered here for re-
viewing the formulation and theory behind MVES problem [8]. Like
many other HU algorithms [1], we begin with dimension reduction
of the observed pixels by projecting them onto an observed-pixel-
constructed affine set [8, 10], as given in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. (Dimension reduction by affine set fitting [8]) Under
(A2) and (A3), the dimension-reduced pixel vector x˜[n] can be
obtained by an affine transformation of x[n]:
x˜[n] = CT (x[n]− d) ∈ RN−1, (4)
where (C,d) is the affine set fitting solution given by
d =
1
L
L

n=1
x[n], (5)
C = [ q1(UU
T ), q2(UU
T ), . . . , qN−1(UU
T ) ], (6)
where U = [ x[1]−d, . . . ,x[L]−d ] ∈ RM×L, and qi(R) denotes
the eigenvector associated with the ith principal eigenvalue of R.
An important remark related to Lemma 1 is as follows:
(R1) The affine set fitting solution of the noisy observed pixels
(Cˆ, dˆ) (obtained from (5) and (6) by replacing x[n] withy[n])
gives a best approximation in the least-squares sense [10], and
it asymptotically approaches the true (C,d) for large L.
Since   Nj=1 sj [n] = 1 [(A2)], it follows by substituting the
noise-free signal model (2) into (4) that
x˜[n] =
N

j=1
sj [n]αj , (7)
where αj = CT (aj − d) ∈ RN−1 is the jth dimension-reduced
endmember signature. Moreover, due to si[n] ≥ 0 [(A1)], it has
been proven in [8] that
x˜[n] ∈ conv{α1, . . . ,αN} ⊂ RN−1, ∀n (8)
and conv{α1, . . . ,αN} is a simplex.
Based on Craig’s belief [4], the unmixing problem of finding a
minimum volume simplex enclosing all the dimension-reduced pix-
els can now be written as the following optimization problem [8]:
min
β1,...,βN∈R
N−1
V (β1, . . . ,βN)
s.t. x˜[n] ∈ conv{β1, . . . ,βN}, ∀ n,
(9)
where V (β1, . . . ,βN) is the volume of the simplex conv{β1, . . . ,
βN} given by [11]
V (β1, . . . ,βN) =
|det(B)|
(N − 1)! (10)
and B = [ β1 − βN , . . . ,βN−1 − βN ] ∈ R(N−1)×(N−1) . In
addition, by (3), we rewrite the constraint of (9) in terms of B as
x˜[n] = βN + Bθn, (11)
where θn  0 and 1TN−1θn ≤ 1. Hence, problem (9) can be equiv-
alently written as
min
B∈R(N−1)×(N−1),
βN ,θ1,...,θL∈R
N−1
|det(B)|
s.t. θn  0, 1TN−1θn ≤ 1,
x˜[n] = βN + Bθn, ∀ n.
(12)
By letting θn = Hx˜[n] − g for all n where H = B−1 and g =
B−1βN , one can eliminate the variables θn for all n in (12) and
come up with
max
H∈R(N−1)×(N−1), g∈RN−1
|det(H)|
s.t. 1TN−1(Hx˜[n]− g) ≤ 1,
Hx˜[n] − g  0, ∀ n.
(13)
Next, we will show how the MVES problem in (13) can be reformu-
lated for the noisy scenario.
4. ROBUST MVES PROBLEM AND ALGORITHM
Let us consider the noisy signal model given by (1). From (1), (4)
and (R1), we get
y˜[n]  CˆT (y[n]− dˆ) ∼= x˜[n] + CˆTw[n], (14)
where CˆTw[n] is a random vector following N (0, σ2IN−1) (since
CˆT is a semi-unitary matrix). Following the footsteps of the MVES
problem formulation, the robust MVES problem can be expressed
by replacing x˜[n] by y˜[n]− CˆTw[n] in (13):
max
H, g
|det(H)|
s.t. 1TN−1(Hy˜[n]−HCˆTw[n]− g) ≤ 1,
Hy˜[n]−HCˆTw[n]− g  0, ∀ n,
(15)
where 1TN−1HCˆ
Tw[n]  z[n] and HCˆTw[n]  u[n]
are a random variable and a random vector with distribu-
tionsN (0, σ21TN−1HHT1N−1) and N (0, σ2HHT ), respectively.
Since the constraints in (15) involve randomness, they can be man-
ifested as chance constraints so as to mitigate the noise effects in

for all n = 1, . . . , L. To ensure (A1), the negative values of  s[n] are
made zero. The above procedure is referred to as RMVES algorithm.
The proposed RMVES algorithm uses the well known VCA [3]
for the initialization of (24) [6]. The optimization problem in (24) is
then solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Moreover,
in each iteration of the RMVES algorithm (which involves N − 1
row updates of H), we use the solution of the previous iteration as
the initialization for the current iteration.
5. SIMULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
In this section, the efficacy of the proposed RMVES algorithm is
demonstrated using 50 Monte Carlo runs for various purity lev-
els and SNRs. In each run, 1000 noise-free observed pixel vec-
tors were synthetically generated following the signal model in (2),
where 6 endmembers (i.e., Alunite, Buddingtonite, Calcite, Copi-
apite, Kaolinite, and Muscovite) with 417 bands are selected from
USGS library [12], and the abundance vectors s[n] were generated
following Dirichlet distribution D(s[n], μ) with μ = 1
N
1N [3], for
different purity levels ρ = 0.7, 0.85, 1 [8]. The noisy data were
obtained by adding independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
zero-mean Gaussian noise to the noise-free data for different SNRs,
where SNR =  Ln=1 ‖x[n]‖22/σ2ML. To maintain non-negativity
of the noisy observed pixels, we artificially set the negative values of
the noisy pixels to zero. For performance comparison, we also tested
three existing algorithms, N-FINDR-FCLS [2,13] (where FCLS [13]
was used to find the associated abundances for the endmember esti-
mates of N-FINDR), MVSA [6], and the original MVES [8].
The root-mean-square (rms) spectral angle between the true one
and estimated one (which has been widely used in HU [1, 3, 8]) is
used as the performance index. We here denote rms spectral angle
between endmembers and their estimates as φen, and that between
abundance maps and their estimates as φab. By our extensive nu-
merical experience we found that η (which depends on ρ and SNR)
should be less than 0.5 (this can also be justified from Figure 1).
The average φen and φab of the unmixing algorithms over SNR
= 20, 25, ..., 40 dB and ρ = 0.7, 0.85, 1 are shown in Table 1,
where each bold-faced number denotes the minimum rms spectral
angle associated with a specific pair of (ρ,SNR) over all the algo-
rithms. Table 1 shows that the proposed RMVES algorithm yields
the best performance for ρ = 0.7 and 0.85. For all the values of
ρ, the RMVES algorithm is better than its predecessor, the MVES
algorithm. In addition, to investigate the problem natures of (22)
and (24), we simply performed Monte Carlo simulations by directly
solving (22) using SQP for ρ = 0.7 and SNR = 20 dB. The average
φen and φab were 9.04 and 24.73 degrees, respectively, which are
apparently much worse than those (1.69 and 9.21) of solving (24) in
an alternating fashion (RMVES algorithm). This may be attributed
to local optimality issues associated with the highly non-convex na-
ture of (22).
In conclusion, we have presented a robust hyperspectral unmix-
ing method, namely the RMVES algorithm which can effectively
unmix the highly mixed and noisy data. The RMVES algorithm ap-
plies chance constraints to accommodate the noise effects, and can
be suitably implemented using SQP solvers in an alternating fashion.
Simulation results showed that the RMVES algorithm outperforms
some existing benchmark algorithms and its predecessor MVES al-
gorithm. The application of RMVES algorithm to real hyperspectral
data would be our future direction.

more power efficient than that without AN, in discriminating Bob

2. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider a wireless downlink system that consists of a transmitter
(Alice), a legitimate receiver (Bob) and 𝑀 unauthorized receivers
(Eves). We assume that Alice is equipped with𝑁𝑡 transmit antennas,
and both Bob and Eves are equipped with only one receive antenna.
Let x(𝑡) ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 denote the signal vector transmitted from Alice, and
let h ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 and 𝒈𝑚 ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 denote the channel vectors from Alice
to Bob and from Alice to the 𝑚th Eve, respectively. The received
signals at Bob and Eves can be expressed as
𝑦𝑏(𝑡) = h
𝐻
x(𝑡) + 𝑛(𝑡), (1)
𝑦𝑒,𝑚(𝑡) = 𝒈
𝐻
𝑚x(𝑡) + 𝑣𝑚(𝑡), 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀, (2)
where 𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑣𝑚(𝑡) are the additive noise at Bob and Eve 𝑚,
respectively. They are assumed to be independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean, complex Gaussian random variables
with variances equal to 𝜎2𝑛 and 𝜎
2
𝑣,𝑚, respectively.
The aim of Alice is to design the transmit signal vector x(𝑡) ∈
ℂ𝑁𝑡 such that Bob can retrieve the information signal with a desired
quality of service (QoS) while all Eves can only have limited recep-
tion performance. Taking the received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
(or the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) if
interference are also present) as the QoS measure, QoS discrimina-
tion can be achieved via transmit beamforming [9], that is, by letting
x(𝑡) = 𝒘𝑠(𝑡) where 𝒘 ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑡 is the beamforming vector and 𝑠(𝑡)
is the information signal. Assuming that 𝑠(𝑡) has unit variance, one
can show by (1) and (2) that the SNRs at Bob and Eves are respec-
tively given by
SNR𝑏 = 𝒘
𝐻
Rℎ𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑛, SNR𝑒,𝑚 = 𝒘
𝐻
R𝑔,𝑚𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑣,𝑚, (3)
whereRℎ = hh𝐻 andR𝑔,𝑚 = 𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚 if the instantaneous CSIs of
Bob and Eves are available to Alice; whileRℎ = E{hh𝐻} ર 0 and
R𝑔,𝑚 = E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} ર 0 (here𝑿 ર 0 means that𝑿 is Hermitian
positive semidefinite (PSD)) if only the channel correlation matrices
are known to Alice. Hence, with target SNR values 𝛾𝑏 for Bob and
𝛾𝑒 for Eves (𝛾𝑏 > 𝛾𝑒), one can design the beamforming vector𝒘 by
considering the following optimization problem
𝑃 ★ = min
𝒘∈ℂ𝑁𝑡
∥𝒘∥2 (4a)
subject to (s.t.) 𝒘𝐻Rℎ𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑛 ≥ 𝛾𝑏, (4b)
𝒘
𝐻
R𝑔,𝑚𝒘/𝜎
2
𝑣,𝑚 ≤ 𝛾𝑒, 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀. (4c)
We should mention that the same design formulation as in (4) has
been used in transmit beamforming for spectrum sharing in cogni-
tive radios [9], a different application. Problem (4) is in general
a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, but interestingly when
Rℎ = hh
𝐻 (i.e., Alice perfectly knows Bob’s CSI) problem (4) can
be recast as a convex quadratic program as follows (see, e.g., [10]):
min
𝒘∈ℂ𝑁𝑡
∥𝒘∥2 (5a)
s.t. Real{h𝐻𝒘} ≥
√
𝛾𝑏 𝜎2𝑛, Im{h𝐻𝒘} = 0, (5b)
𝒘
𝐻
R𝑔,𝑚𝒘 ≤ 𝛾𝑒𝜎2𝑣,𝑚, 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀, (5c)
where Real{h𝐻𝒘} and Im{h𝐻𝒘} denote the real and imaginary
parts of h𝐻𝒘.
The design formulation in (4) depends on the degree of freedoms
(DOFs) of multiple antennas (which is 𝑁𝑡) in discriminating Bob
and Eves’ SNRs. Therefore, when 𝑀 is comparable to 𝑁𝑡 or when
the target SNR ratio 𝛾𝑏/𝛾𝑒 is set too high, the beamformer 𝒘 has
to spend most of its DOFs in fulfilling (4c), but leaves very limited
number of DOFs for directing the main beam power toward Bob. In
that case, the optimum𝒘★ of problem (4) inevitably require to scale
up the transmit power ∥𝒘★∥2 in order to meet Bob’s SNR demand
in (4b).
3. PROPOSED TRANSMIT BEAMFORMING USING
ARTIFICIAL NOISE
In the section, we propose a new transmit beamforming strategy by
incorporating artificial noise (AN) into signal transmission design.
We will show how the associated beamforming problem can be effi-
ciently handled by the SDP relaxation method [7].
3.1. Proposed Beamforming Strategy Using AN
We propose to increase the interference level at Eves by incorporat-
ing AN [5] in the transmit beamforming design. In the AN-aided
approach, the transmit signal x(𝑡) is modified as
x(𝑡) = 𝒘𝑠(𝑡) + z(𝑡), (6)
where
z(𝑡) ∼ 𝒞𝒩 (0,Σ), (7)
that is, z(𝑡) follows the zero-mean complex Gaussian distribution
with covariance matrix Σ ર 0. Under the AN-aided setting in (6),
we can deduce from the models in (1) and (2) that the SINRs at Bob
and Eves are
SINR𝑏=
𝒘𝐻Rℎ𝒘
Tr(RℎΣ) + 𝜎2𝑛
, SINR𝑒,𝑚=
𝒘𝐻R𝑔,𝑚𝒘
Tr(R𝑔,𝑚Σ) + 𝜎2𝑣,𝑚
, (8)
respectively, and the average transmit power is given by
E{∥x(𝑡)∥2} = ∥𝒘∥2 + Tr(Σ), (9)
where Tr(⋅) denotes the trace of a matrix. While the SINR𝑏 in (8)
seems degraded compared to the SNRs in (3) due to the added AN,
by joint design of the beamforming vector 𝒘 and AN covariance
matrix Σ, we shall be able to alleviate the degradation and in the
meantime effectively enhance the performance discrimination be-
tween Bob and Eves. Following the power minimization criterion
in (4), the design formulation for the AN-aided case is as follows:
𝑃 ★AN = min
𝒘,Σ
∥𝒘∥2 +Tr(Σ) (10a)
s.t.
𝒘𝐻Rℎ𝒘
Tr(RℎΣ) + 𝜎2𝑛
≥ 𝛾𝑏, (10b)
𝒘𝐻R𝑔,𝑚𝒘
Tr(R𝑔,𝑚Σ) + 𝜎2𝑣,𝑚
≤ 𝛾𝑒, 𝑚 = 1, . . . ,𝑀, (10c)
Σ ર 0. (10d)
A benefit that we can immediately see from (10) is that 𝑃 ★AN ≤
𝑃 ★; i.e., the proposed formulation (10) is more power efficient than
its no-AN counterpart (4), given the same specifications of 𝛾𝑏 and
𝛾𝑒. The reason for this is that the feasible set of problem (4), together
with Σ = 0, is merely a subset of the feasible set of (10). Problem
(10) is more difficult to handle than (4), however. In particular, one
can check that, unlike problem (4), problem (10) does not admit a
convex reformulation as in (5) whenRℎ = hh𝐻 . However, we will
present next that problem (10) can be efficiently handled by the SDP
relaxation technique [7].

𝐻 and R𝑔,𝑚 =

𝐻
𝑚 for all 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3.
As the final simulation example, we considered problems (4) and
(10) withRℎ = hh𝐻 andR𝑔,𝑚 = E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} for 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3; i.e.,
Alice has the perfect Alice-to-Bob CSI but only knows the correla-
tion matrices of Alice-to-Eves channels. The channel vector h was
complex Gaussian distributed 𝒞𝒩 (0, I𝑁𝑡/𝑁𝑡) and the covariance
matrices E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} were given by
E{𝒈𝑚𝒈𝐻𝑚} = 𝛼 ¯𝑚¯
𝐻
𝑚
∣∣¯𝑚∣∣2 + (1− 𝛼)Λ, 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3, (16)
where ¯𝑚 ∼ 𝒞𝒩 (0, I𝑁𝑡 ), [Λ]𝑖,𝑗 = 0.1∣𝑖−𝑗∣/𝑁𝑡 specifies the de-
gree of correlation between transmit antennas, and 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1] was
used to control the level of uncertainty of channel coefficients. In
this particular example, we found that problem (4) or problem (10)
may be infeasible (or have no solution) sometimes, especially if the
given problem instances Rℎ,R𝑔,1, . . .R𝑔,𝑀 are harsh. In Fig. 3,
we present the percentage of infeasibility (%) of problems (4) and
(10) out of 1000 simulation trials for 𝛾𝑒 = 3 dB. One can see from
the figure that for 𝛼 = 0.8 and 1/𝜎2𝑣 ≥ 10 dB problem (4) has
about 30% infeasibility rate, and it can increase to about 55% for
𝛼 = 0.6. The proposed problem (10) by contrast is always feasible
for both 𝛼 = 0.6 and 𝛼 = 0.8. The presented simulation results well
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming strategy
in power consumption as well as in feasibility.

ABSTRACT
Accurate estimation of endmember signatures and the associated
abundances of a scene from its hyperspectral observations is at
present, a challenging research area. Many of the existing hyper-
spectral unmixing algorithms are based on Winter’s belief, which
states that the vertices of the maximum volume simplex inside
the data cloud (observations) will yield high fidelity estimates of
the endmember signatures if pure-pixels exist. Based on Winter’s
belief, we recently proposed a convex analysis based alternating vol-
ume maximization (AVMAX) algorithm. In this paper we develop
a robust version of the AVMAX algorithm. Here, the presence of
noise in the hyperspectral observations is taken into consideration
with the original deterministic constraints suitably reformulated as
probabilistic constraints. The subproblems involved are convex
problems and they can be effectively solved using available convex
optimization solvers. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed RAVMAX algorithm over
several existing pure-pixel based hyperspectral unmixing methods,
including its predecessor, the AVMAX algorithm.

A hyperspectral sensor records the electromagnetic scattering pat-
terns of distinct materials over hundreds of spectral bands that range
from visible to near-infrared wavelength region. The limited spatial
resolution of the sensor used for hyperspectral imaging demands an
effective hyperspectral unmixing (HU) scheme to extract the under-
lying endmember signatures (or simply endmembers) and the asso-
ciated abundance maps distributed over a scene of interest [1]. Con-
ventional HU algorithms based on a linear mixing model (to be ex-
plained later) are based on the assumption that in a given set of hy-
perspectral observations, there exists a pure-pixel for each endmem-
ber, namely, pixels that are fully contributed by a single endmember.
HU algorithms based on the pure-pixel assumption includes pixel
purity index (PPI) [2], N-finder (N-FINDR) [3] and vertex compo-
nent analysis (VCA) [4]. A recent addition to this group is the AV-
MAX [5] algorithm, which is a convex analysis based optimization
algorithm based on Winter’s belief. It employs an alternating linear
programming approach to solve the optimization problem. Never-
theless, the performance of the above mentioned algorithms is de-
graded when the observations are corrupted by noise.
This work was supported by the National Science Council (R.O.C.) un-
der Grant NSC 96-2628-E-007-003-MY3, and by General Research Funds
of Hong Kong Research Grant Council (Project Nos. CUHK415509,
CUHK415908).
In this paper, we extend our AVMAX [5] algorithm to a ro-
bust AVMAX (RAVMAX) algorithm that accounts for the noise ef-
fects by employing chance constraints. We first reformulate the AV-
MAX subproblems into equivalent problems to which the chance
constraint can be suitably applied, and then reformulate them as
second-order cone problems. Hence, the chance constrained prob-
lem can be efficiently solved by any convex optimization solvers in
an alternating fashion. We finally show some Monte-Carlo simula-
tions to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed RAVMAX algo-
rithm, in comparison with the conventional pure-pixel based algo-
rithms, including its predecessor.
In the remainder of the paper, the following notations are em-
ployed. RM and RM×N represent the sets of all real M × 1 vectors
and M ×N matrices, respectively. The symbol  denotes compo-
nentwise inequality. 1N , IM and 0 respectively represent the N × 1
all one vector, the M ×M identity matrix and an all-zero vector of
proper dimension. A Gaussian distribution with mean vector µ and
covariance matrix Σ is denoted as N (µ,Σ). The notation sign(b)
denotes a vector whose elements are the signs of the elements in the
vector b, |b| denotes a column vector whose elements are the ab-
solute values of the individual elements in b, and diag(b) denotes
a diagonal matrix with the elements of b as its diagonal elements.
The symbol [a]i and Aij denote the ith element of the vector a and
(i, j)th element of matrixA, respectively. Finally, the symbol [A]i,:
corresponds to the ith row vector of A.
2. SIGNAL MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
Consider a scenario in which a hyperspectral sensor measures solar
electromagnetic radiation from N distinct substances. Each pixel of
the hyperspectral images measured over M spectral bands can be
represented by the following M ×N linear mixing model [1, 3–6]
y[n] = x[n] +w[n], (1)
x[n] = As[n] =
N∑
i=1
si[n]ai, ∀n = 1, . . . , L. (2)
In (1), y[n] = [ y1[n], . . . , yM [n] ]T represents the nth ob-
served pixel vector comprising M spectral bands and x[n] =
[ x1[n], . . . , xM [n] ]
T corresponds to its noise-free counterpart.
The noise vector, w[n] = [ w1[n], . . . , wM [n] ]T in (1), is zero-
mean, uniform white Gaussian noise vector (i.e., N (0,D), where
D = σ2IM and σ denotes the standard deviation of the noise). In
(2), A = [ a1, . . . ,aN ] ∈ RM×N denotes the endmember signa-
ture matrix with the ith column vector ai being the ith endmember
signature, s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T ∈ RN is the nth abundance
vector comprising N fractional abundances and L is the total num-
ber of observed pixels. Assuming prior knowledge of the number of
q? = min

j GGνj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t. Gνj = GX˜θj , θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1.
(16)
Then, by change of variables, we let
αj = Bνj (17)
and
βj = Gνj . (18)
To facilitate the application of chance constraints to the AVMAX
problem, we relax the first equality constraints of (15) and (16) and
thus the corresponding subproblems are given as below:
p? = max
αj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
|bj |
T
αj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t. αj  BX˜θj , θj  0, 1

Lθj = 1,

T
βj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t. βj  GX˜θj , θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1.
(20)
Although we relax the first constraints of the subproblems, we still
can show that the optimal solutions of (19) and (20) are equivalent to
that of (13) and (14), respectively, as proved in the following lemma:
Lemma 2. (Equivalence of subproblems) The subproblems (19)
and (20) are equivalent to (13) and (14), respectively.
The proof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix.
4.2. Robust AVMAX Algorithm
Now we consider the unmixing problem with noisy observations
given by (1). Substituting (1) into (4), we get the following dimen-
sion reduced observations
y˜[n] , CˆT (y[n]− dˆ) ∼= x˜[n] + Cˆ
T
w[n], (21)
where CˆTw[n] is a random vector followingN (0, CˆTDCˆ). In ma-
trix form (considering all the pixels, n = 1, . . . , L), we can write the
above equation as: Y˜ = X˜+ CˆTW, where Y˜ = [y˜[1], . . . , y˜[L]],
X˜ = [x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]], and W = [w[1], . . . ,w[L]]. The first in-
equality constraint in (19) now becomes:
αj  B(Y˜ − Cˆ
T
W)θj = BY˜θj + zj , (22)
where zj , −BCˆTWθj ∼ N (0,BCˆTDCˆBT ‖θj‖22).
Since the noise-induced vector zj is random and unknown, our
approach is to replace (22) with chance constraints, as shown below
Pr{[αj ]i − [B]i,:Y˜θj ≤ [zj ]i} ≥ η,∀ i = 1, . . . , N − 1, (23)
where 0 < η < 1 is a design parameter. A similar equation can be
written for the first inequality constraint of (20), i.e.,
Pr{[βj ]i − [G]i,:Y˜θj ≤ [zj ]i} ≥ η,∀ i = 1, . . . , N − 1. (24)
The second-order cone equivalence of a chance constraint
has been discussed in [7]. Specifically, for a random variable
ε ∼ N (µ, δ2) and t ∈ R, one can show that Pr(ε ≤ t) ≥ η is true
as t ≥ δΦ−1(η) + µ, where Φ−1 is the inverse of the cumulative
distribution function of the standard normal random variable.
By letting Q = BCˆTDCˆBT ∈ R(N−1)×(N−1) and applying
the above mentioned chance constraint procedure to (23) and (24),
we have √
Qii‖θj‖2Φ
−1(1− η) ≥ [αj ]i − [B]i,:Y˜θj , (25)
and √
Qii‖θj‖2Φ
−1(1− η) ≥ [βj ]i − [G]i,:Y˜θj . (26)
for all i = 1, . . . , N−1. By replacing the first constraints of (19) and
(20) with (25) and (26), respectively, the robust AVMAX problem
can then be written as:
p? = max
αj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
|bTj |αj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t.
√
Qii‖θj‖2Φ
−1(1− η) ≥ [αj ]i − [B]i,:Y˜θj ,
θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1, ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1.
(27)
q? = min
βj∈R
N−1,θj∈R
L
− |bTj |βj + (−1)
N+jdet(VNj)
s.t.
√
Qii‖θj‖2Φ
−1(1− η) ≥ [βj ]i − [G]i,:Y˜θj ,
θj  0, 1
T
Lθj = 1, ∀ i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1.
(28)
The values of η affect the feasible sets of (27) and (28); specif-
ically, their convexity. The following are the three possible cases:
When η > 0.5 (i.e., Φ−1(1 − η) < 0), the first constraints of both
subproblems are second-order cone constraints and hence subprob-
lems (27) and (28) are convex. If η = 0.5 (i.e., Φ−1(1−η) = 0), the
first constraints of both subproblems reduce to those of the original
AVMAX problem (as in (13) and (14)), i.e., the constraints become
linear (convex). Finally, if η < 0.5 (i.e., Φ−1(1 − η) > 0), the
constraints become non-convex. The effect of η is illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. From our extensive numerical experiences we found that for
satisfactory performance, the η value should lie between 0.9 and 1,
in which case the subproblems (27) and (28) are convex.

η > 0.5
η = 0.5
η < 0.5
Fig. 1. Illustration of the effect of η in RAVMAX for N = 3.
Some more technical aspects are discussed as follows. The sub-
problems (27) and (28) are solved in an alternating fashion, simi-
lar to the original AVMAX explained in Section 3, except for the
following difference: after each execution of the subproblems, the
corresponding νj = Bαj (by (17)) is obtained if |p?| > |q?|, else
νj = Gβj (by (18)) is obtained. The proposed RAVMAX algo-
rithm uses any N pixel vectors in X˜ for its initialization. As the
subproblems are convex (for our desired choice, η > 0.5), they can
be solved effectively by using available convex optimization solvers.
5. SIMULATIONS
This section demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RAVMAX
through comparison with other pure-pixel based HU algorithms. The
algorithms considered are N-FINDR [3], VCA [4] and AVMAX [5].

Talk 1: Non-negative Least-correlated Component Analysis for Separation of 
Dependent Sources by Volume Maximization  
Abstract: Although significant efforts have been made in developing non-negative blind source 
separation techniques, accurate separation of positive yet dependent sources remains a challenging 
task. In this talk, a joint correlation function of multiple signals is proposed to reveal and confirm that 
the observations after non-negative mixing would have higher joint correlation than the original 
unknown sources. Accordingly, a new non-negative least-correlated component analysis (nLCA) 
method is presented to design the unmixing matrix by minimizing the joint correlation function 
among the estimated nonnegative sources. In addition to a closed-form solution for unmixing two 
mixtures of two sources, the general algorithm of nLCA for the multi-source case is developed based 
on an iterative volume maximization (IVM) principle and linear programming. The source 
identifiability and required conditions are discussed and proved. The proposed nLCA algorithm, 
denoted as nLCA-IVM, is evaluated with both simulation data and real biomedical data to 
demonstrate its superior performance over several existing benchmark methods.

Introduction
Some recent nBSS developments do not require sources to be
statistically independent (or uncorrelated).
NMF4 [Lee99] and CAMNS5 [Chan07].
Non-negative least-correlated component analysis (nLCA)
Assume non-negativity for sources and mixing matrix, without requiring
any statistical dependence/independence assumptions or conditions on
sources.
Minimize a joint correlation function (not in any statistical sense) of all
the separated sources for the design of the demixing matrix.
The nLCA to be presented is fulfilled by an iterative volume maximization
(IVM) algorithm, denoted as nLCA-IVM, which shows better
performance than some existing benchmark methods.
A closed-form solution is available for unmixing two mixtures of two
sources.

Problem Formulation
Our goal is to design a demixing matrix W = [wij ] ∈ RN×M such
that
y[n] =Wx[n] = (WA)s[n] = Ps[n], (2)
where
y[n] = (y1[n], y2[n], . . . , yN [n])T is the extracted (unmixed)
source point,
P =WA ∈ RN×N is a permutation matrix.
Define

si = (si[1], si[2], . . . , si[L])T , i = 1, ..., N, (ith source)
yi = (yi[1], yi[2], . . . , yi[L])T , i = 1, ..., N, (ith extracted source)
8 / 51
Assumptions
The nLCA-IVM to be presented is based on the following
non-statistical assumptions:
(A1) (Non-negative sources) For each j, sj ∈ RL+.
(A2) (Non-negative mixing matrix) A ∈ RM×N+ .
(A3) M ≥ N and A is of full column rank, i.e., rank(A) = N .
(A4) (Unit row sum) A1N = 1M .
(A1) and (A2) are usually true in imaging analysis.
(A3) is generally true in nBSS problems.
(A4) is satisfied in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to
the partial volume effect [Wang06], in contrast to the full
additivity condition on the sources (i.e., sT [n]1N = 1, ∀n) in
hyperspectral imaging [Stein02].

nLCA: Geometric Insights
For the case of M = 2, the conventional pair-wise correlation
coefficient between x1 and x2 is widely known as
ρ(x1,x2) =
xT1 x2
‖x1‖ · ‖x2‖ = cos(θ(x1,x2)),
where 0 ≤ θ(x1,x2) ≤ pi/2 is the angle between the vectors
x1  0 and x2  0. It is straightforward to see
min ρ(x1,x2) ⇔ max θ(x1,x2).
14 / 51
nLCA: Joint Correlation Function of Multiple Signals
We propose a joint correlation function of M ≥ 2 signal vectors
defined as the inverse of the volume of the solid region formed by
these signal vectors, i.e.,
corr(x1,x2, . . . ,xM ) =
1
V (sol{x1,x2, . . . ,xM})
where
V (sol{x1,x2, . . . ,xM}) =
∫
sol{x1,x2,...,xM}
dξ,
namely, the multiple integral over sol{x1,x2, . . . ,xM}.
16 / 51
nLCA: nBSS problem
Owing to one-to-one mapping between corr(·) and V (sol{·}), the
nBSS problem can be reformulated as
max

V (sol{y1, . . . ,yN})
s.t. W1M = 1N , yi = Σ

j=1wijxj  0, ∀i = 1, . . . , N.
(6)
Case of M = N : the IVM algorithm for solving (6) will be
presented next, which is applicable only for M = N .
Case of M > N : the principal component analysis (PCA)
[Hastie02] is considered to obtain best N noise-reduced and
rank-reduced observations to be processed by the IVM
algorithm.
18 / 51
nLCA: IVM Algorithm (M = N)
The nBSS problem (7) can be decomposed into the following
two optimization subproblems:
p? = max

The optimal solution of (7), denoted by W?, is chosen as the
optimal solution of (8a) if |p?| > |q?| or the optimal solution
of (8b) if |q?| > |p?|.

nLCA-IVM: Closed-form Solution for M = N = 2
Proposition 1
Under (A1) to (A4), problem (7) has a closed-form solution W? where
w?11 = max

,
and w?12 = 1− w?11 and w?22 = 1− w?21.
Remarks:
nLCA-ES also has the same solution for W? above for the case of
M = N = 2.
The nLCA-IVM obtains W? in one iteration (besides one iteration for
convergence check) for the case of M = N = 2.
28 / 51
Dimension and Noise Reduction by PCA
By the rank inequality [Horn85],
rank(S)+rank(A)−N ≤ rank(SAT ) ≤ min{rank(S), rank(A)},
one can see, from rank(A) = N and rank(S) = N , that
rank(SAT ) = N < M.
However,
N ≤ rank(X) ≤M, as Ψ 6= 0,
implying that usually rank(X) = M as Ψ 6= 0 while rank(X) = N
ideally (as Ψ = 0).
=⇒ Use PCA for simultaneous noise reduction and rank reduction.

λ?i = (V
?)T (xi − µ?),
and V? is a matrix comprising (N − 1) principal left singular
vectors of [x1 − µ?, . . . ,xM − µ?] ∈ RL×M .
Selection of N Noise-reduced Observations
The selected N noise-reduced (rank-reduced) observations x?i ∈ RL+ to be
processed by the IVM algorithm are the ones with the smallest approximation
errors ‖x?i − xi‖2, and meanwhile all the negative components of the selected
x?i are replaced by zero.

Real Data Experiment: Fluorescence microscopy signals
Fluorescence microscopy produces multispectral images by staining the
components of a specimen with different fluorescence biomarkers, and
captures fluorescence images by an optical sensor array (e.g. CCD
camera).
In the investigation of the multiple labeled fluorescent specimen, two or
more emission signals are often overlapped in the measured images since
the spatial positions of the labeled components are very close. This is
so-called crosstalk, which can be modeled as an nBSS problem.

Real Data Experiment: DCE-MRI
Dynamic Contrast Enhancement-MRI (DCE-MRI) can distinguish
vascular heterogeneity and elucidate features that characterize angiogenic
blood vessels from their normal counterparts.
DCE-MRI also has potential utility in measuring the efficacy of
angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer treatment in vivo.
Nineteen breast DCE-MRI images (observations) (M = 19 and N = 2) at
different time points provided from Prof. Yue Wang, Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, USA, were used in the experiment.
Each column of the mixing matrix A = [aij ]19×2 is so-called “Time
Activity Curve” (TAC) of one source. Non-negative least squares estimate
of TACs can be obtained from X (= SAT +Ψ) and Sˆ.

TACs can show the metabolism variations of the injected contrast agent
for different physiologies.
The descending curve (dashed line) shows the fast contrast agent
perfusion, a phenotype of cancer tumors in metabolism. The ascending

tissues.

Existing Algorithms for Hyperspectral Unmixing
Endmember extraction algorithms based on the pure pixel
assumption [(A4)] that only estimate endmembers (A); e.g.,
pixel purity index (PPI) [Boardman’95],
n-finder (N-FINDR) [Winter’99],
vertex component analysis (VCA) [Nascimento’05],
convex cone analysis (CCA) [Ifarraguerri’99].
Endmember estimation is usually followed by abundance
estimation using, for instance, fully constrained least squares
(FCLS) [Heinz’01].
Unmixing algorithms that estimate endmembers (A) and
abundances s[n] simultaneously; e.g.,
alternating projected subgradients (APS) [Zymnis’07],
iterated constrained endmembers (ICE) [Berman’04],
minimum volume transform (MVT) [Craig’94],
minimum volume constrained non-negative matrix factorization
(MVC-NMF) [Miao’07],
minimum volume simplex analysis (MVSA) [Li’08].
9 / 62
Our Contributions
It can be proven by convex analysis that both Winter’s and
Craig’s unmixing criteria yield the same N true endmembers
when N pure pixels exist.
We illustrate how the two (non-convex) optimization problems
can be efficiently solved by alternating linear programming,
leading to AVMAX algorithm (by Winter’s criterion) and
AVMIN algorithm (by Craig’s criterion).
Simulation results show their superior performance over some
existing benchmark unmixing methods for synthetic data, and
the AVMIN algorithm also works well for real hyperspectral
image data (Cuprite mining site, Nevada, 1997).

Affine Hull
An affine hull can always be represented by:
aff{a1, . . . ,aN} =
{
x = Cα+ d
∣∣ α ∈ RP }
for some (non-unique) d ∈ RM and C ∈ RM×P , where
P ≤ N − 1 is the affine dimension.
If {a1, . . . ,aN} is an affinely independent set (or
{a1 − aN , . . . ,aN−1 − aN} is linearly independent), then the
affine dimension P is maximal; i.e., P = N − 1.
13 / 62
A point x ∈ conv{a1, . . . ,aN} is an extreme point (or
vertex) of conv{a1, . . . ,aN} if x is not any nontrivial convex
combination of {a1, . . . ,aN}. Intuitively, the extreme points
of conv{a1, . . . ,aN} are its corner points.
If {a1, . . . ,aN} is affinely independent, then
conv{a1, . . . ,aN} is called a simplex and its extreme points
(or vertices) are a1, . . . ,aN .
A simplex is called simplest simplex if M = N − 1. For
instance, point (N = 1), line segment (N = 2), triangle and
its interior (N = 3).
In the following presentation, we use the term ’simplex’
instead of ’simplest simplex’ for the sake of simplicity.
15 / 62
A. Dimension Reduction:
Under (A2) and (A3), one can readily infer from (1) that
x[n] =
N∑
i=1
si[n]ai ∈ aff{a1, . . . ,aN} = A(C,d), ∀ n
for some (C,d) ∈ RM×(N−1) × RM and rank(C) = N − 1.
Lemma 1 (Endmember affine set construction)
Let d = 1L
∑L
n=1 x[n] and U = [ x[1]− d, . . . ,x[L]− d ] ∈ RM×L.
Suppose that (A2) and (A3) are true. Then
A(C,d) = aff{x[1], . . . ,x[L]},
where
C = [q1(UUT ), q2(UUT ), . . . , qN−1(UUT )],
in which qi(R) denotes the unit-norm eigenvector associated with the ith
principal eigenvalue of R.

Alternating LP Approach to Volume Maximization
Theorem 1 (Endmember identifiability of Winter’s criterion)
The optimal solution of (3) is uniquely given by α1, . . . ,αN if and
only if (A1)− (A4) hold. Each αi corresponds to an endmember
ai = Cαi + d, where (C,d) is given in Lemma 1.
An equivalent form of (3) is given by
Maximum volume simplex fitting problem
max
νi∈RN−1
θ1,...,θN∈RL
|det(∆(ν1, . . . ,νN ))|
s.t. νi = X˜θi, θi  0, 1TLθi = 1 ∀ i,
(4)
where X˜ = [ x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L] ] ∈ R(N−1)×L.
It is a nonconvex problem, since the objective function is
nonconvex.

Pseudo-code of the AVMAX method
Given A convergence tolerance ε > 0, an endmember affine set
characterization (C,d), the dimension-reduced pixels x˜[n] for
all n, and the number of endmembers N .
Step 1. Obtain some feasible initial ν1, . . . ,νN by randomly selecting
any N dimension-reduced pixels from x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L].
Step 2. Set j := 1 and % := |det(∆(ν1, . . . ,νN ))|.
Step 3. Solve the LPs (4p) and (4p+),and obtain their optimal
solutions, denoted by (ν¯j , θ¯j) and (νj ,θj), respectively.
Step 4. If |p?| > |q?|, then update (νj ,θj) := (ν¯j , θ¯j). Otherwise,
update (νj ,θj) := (νj ,θj).
Step 5. If (j modulo N) 6= 0, then j := j + 1, and goto Step 3,
else
If |max{|p?|, |q?|} − %|/% < ε, then ν?j = νj for all j.
Otherwise, set % := max{|p?|, |q?|}, j := 1, and goto Step 3.

Problem Formulation by Craig’s Criterion
Based on the belief of Craig’s unmixing criterion, we have
Minimum volume simplex fitting problem
min
β1,...,βN
V (β1, . . . ,βN )
s.t. x˜[n] ∈ conv{β1, . . . ,βN}, ∀ n.
(5)
Theorem 2 (Endmember identifiability of Craig’s criterion)
Under (A1) through (A4), the optimal solution of (5) is uniquely
given by α1, . . . ,αN . Each αi corresponds to a true endmember
ai = Cαi + d, where (C,d) is given in Lemma 1.
Theorem 2 provides a sufficient identifiability condition (i.e.,
(A4)). Accurate endmember identification could still be
possible even as pure pixels are not existent by our experience.

Initialization of AVMIN
To initialize (7p), a feasible (H,g) is needed.
We can find a feasible (H,g) by solving the following
feasibility problem:
find (H,g)
s.t. Hx˜[n]− g  0,
1TN−1(Hx˜[n]− g) ≤ 1, ∀ n = 1, . . . , L,
(9)
which can also be implemented by LP.
This approach is referred to as alternating volume
minimization (AVMIN), which simultaneously estimates
endmembers and abundances.
35 / 62
Step 5. Calculate α̂N = (H?)−1g? and
[α̂1, ..., α̂N−1] = α̂N1TN−1 + (H
?)−1.
Step 6. Obtain endmember estimates âi = Cα̂i + d for i = 1, ..., N .
Step 7. Recover the abundance vectors
ŝ[n] = [ (H?x˜[n]− g?)T 1− 1TN−1(H?x˜[n]− g?) ]T
for n = 1, ..., L.
Following the same complexity evaluation as in AVMAX, the
proposed AVMIN has a worst-case computational complexity
of O(N2L1.5) per iteration.
37 / 62
4. Computer Simulations
100 Monte Carlo runs were performed, and 1000 synthetic
pixels x[n] (L = 1000) were generated in each run.
The endmembers A with 417 spectral bands (M = 417) were
selected from U.S. geological survey (USGS) library [Clark’93].
The abundance vectors s[n] were generated following Dirichlet
distribution D(s[n],µ) with µ = 1N 1N , which automatically
enforces (A1) and (A3) [Nascimento’05].

5. Real Data Experiments
Algorithms under test include VCA-FCLS, MVC-NMF, and the
proposed AVMIN.
Real data were captured by Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging
Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight over the Cuprite mining site, Nevada,
in 19971.
The subimage (200× 200,
L = 40000) comprises 224
bands over wavelength from
0.4 to 2.5 µm.
The bands 1-2, 104-113,
148-167, and 221-224 were
removed due to the low SNR
as well as the water-vapor
absorption. (M = 188)

AVMIN identifies 14 minerals that contain less prevalent minerals, i.e.,
Goethite and Halloysite, but MVC-NMF and VCA only identifies 12
minerals.

Some simulation results demonstrated the same performance
of AVMAX and AVMIN when pure pixels exist, and the
superior performance of the latter (AVMIN) over some existing
benchmark algorithms, especially for highly mixed data.
Experimental results with real hyperspectral image data
showed that AVMIN can estimate endmembers and
abundances in high agreement with the reported ground truth.
Besides Winter’s and Craig’s criteria, it may well be
worthwhile to analyze other hyperspectral unmixing
criteria/beliefs (by convex analysis) for devising new effective
algorithms.
Hyperspectral unmixing with noise effects (not seriously
considered in this presentation) taken into account is currently
under investigation.
