Abstract 
 
A complicated decision-making problem such as environmental impact assessment usually requires 
both quantitative and qualitative decision support tools to collaborate for reaping their benefits 
concurrently. Although the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been widely used in EIA, it is hardly to 
address the dependence issue among environmental factors and reflect the subjectivity between science 
and societal values and beliefs. This paper proposes an integrated model to incorporate fuzzy analytic 
network process (quantitative decision support) with fuzzy logic (qualitative decision support) for 
managing environmental impact assessment. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to the EIEs of 
construction projects, exemplified in a case study of the Taiwan High-Speed Rail project.  
 
 
1. Introduction 
In decision theory, there are three types of decision-making: (1) structured, (2) unstructured and (3) semi-structured 
[24]. Structured decision-making is well defined, clearly understood and routine in nature, and can be addressed by 
following a set of standard operating procedures, data processing and management-science models. Structured 
decision-making can be handled by means of quantitative decision support tools such as analytic hierarchy process 
(AHP) [18] or analytic network process (ANP) [19]. On the other hand, unstructured decision-makings cannot be 
addressed by using standard operating procedures because it often has its basis in human intuition, judgment, 
knowledge, and adaptive problem-solving behavior. Qualitative decision support methods such as fuzzy logic [26] 
appear more suitable for dealing with unstructured decision-making. Semi-structured decision-making, having both 
structured and unstructured elements, is a combination of both standard solution procedures and human judgment. 
Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is such a complex semi-structured decision-making because it should not only 
consider the scientific aspect (quantitative decision-making) but also reflect political values and social acceptability 
(qualitative decision-making). Therefore, integrating quantitative and qualitative decision support tools for EIA is the 
focus of this paper. 
 
EIA can be defined as the systematic identification and evaluation of the potential impacts (effects) of proposed 
projects, plans, programs, or legislative actions relative to the physical-chemical, biological, cultural, and 
socioeconomic components of the total environment [4]. The EIA process essentially involves scoping, studying 
baseline conditions, identifying potential impacts, predicting significant impacts, and evaluating them. Scoping 
determines which components are to be included in the EIA and alternatives to be considered. A baseline condition, 
namely the existing environment, is recognized as a benchmark by which the future conditions of project alternatives 
are compared. Historically, several methodologies have been developed for the identification of impacts on the baseline 
condition, including the ad hoc, overlay, checklist, matrix, and networks methods. The purpose of impact prediction is 
to forecast the effects of an identified impact through methods such as subjective judgment, case studies, quantitative 
mathematical models, statistical models, pilot models and experiments. Once an impact has been forecasted, it is 
necessary to evaluate it.  
 
Traditionally, the use of AHP has become a significant trend in EIA due to its capability for facilitating multi-criteria 
 
3
hybrid framework for evaluating environmental impacts. More specifically, this study sought to fulfil environmental 
impact evaluations by using fuzzy-set theory to model the fuzziness of the subjectivity, fuzzy analytic network process 
to manage the dependences among environmental factors and fuzzy logic to manipulate the subjectivity as experts do in 
an synthesized manner.  
 
2. Evaluation Methodologies 
 
2.1 Overall Evaluation Framework 
An evaluation framework for the environmental impact of public infrastructure projects during construction is depicted in 
Fig. 1. This framework considers the overall impact determined by three major clusters: environmental pollution, ecological 
alteration and socioeconomic disturbance. The environmental pollution contains five indicators: air (I1), water (I2), soil 
(I3), noise (I4), solid waste (I5); the ecological alteration contains two indicators: terrestrial (I6), aquatic (I7); the 
socioeconomic disturbance includes three indicators: economics (I8), society (I9) and culture (I10). When assessing these 
ten indicators, the concept of ‘acceptability’ is employed because it can appropriately reflect the confluence between science 
and societal values and beliefs, which is a subjective and qualitative judgment. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), fuzzy logic is applied to 
infer the acceptabilities because it can bridge the gap between scientific measurement and the fulfilment of social objectives 
and provide a way to translate a wide variety of information - objective data, qualitative information, subjective opinions, and 
social needs - into a common language for characterising environmental effects (Silvert, 2000). The evaluation of 
acceptabilities of impacts related to these indicators is based on their respective sub-indicators. Air pollution evaluation refers 
to the appraisal of emission of carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and total suspended 
particulates (TSP); water pollution evaluation involves the conditions of dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD), suspended solids (SS) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) in surface and ground water; soil pollution evaluation denotes 
liquid and gaseous chemical residues in soil; noise pollution evaluation indicates noise and vibration induced by construction 
equipment; solid waste evaluation implies rubbish and industrial waste from construction sites. The evaluation of threats to 
terrestrial species considers the threatened percentages of terrestrial animals, plants and endangered species; moreover, a 
similar evaluation focusing on aquatic species examines the threatened percentages of aquatic animals, plants and endangered 
species. Economic evaluation encompasses disturbances in land-use and development, life quality and economic activities. 
Societal evaluation considers inaccessibilities in public facilities and transportation, and disconnection in communities. 
Cultural evaluation encompasses destroyed cultural heritage and landscapes. The use of fuzzy logic to estimate the indicators 
is outlined in section 2.2. 
 
An evaluation of the overall acceptability of the environmental impact based on these ten indicators involves three 
properties. First, the ten indicators crossing three clusters exist dependences to a certain extent. For example, a lower 
acceptability of water pollution can directly threaten terrestrial and aquatic habitats and somewhat restrain economic 
development, resulting in lower acceptabilities of ecological and economic conditions. Conversely, unacceptable economic 
developments usually cause more water pollution, which in turn leads to threatening natural habitats. Second, due to a lack of 
complete understanding of the interaction between indicators, it is difficult to accurately formulate the mechanism of 
dependence; therefore, expert subjectivity plays a significant role in assessing dependences among indicators. Third, fuzziness 
originates from the qualitative nature of human thinking. The degrees of dependences among indicators are usually expressed 
as in linguistic terms that are inherently fuzzy. To consider these three properties, this study utilised the fuzzy analytic network 
process [14] to evaluate the environmental impact on the basis of the ten indicators shown in Fig. 1 (b) and discussed in 
section 2.3. 
 
2.2 Fuzzy Logic  
Fuzzy logic [27] can be treated as a tool having the ability to compute with words for modeling qualitative human thought 
processes in the analysis of complex systems and decisions. In fuzzy logic, qualitative perception-based reasoning is 
represented by ‘IF-THEN’ fuzzy rules. The rule set concerning the acceptability of air pollution can be exemplified as  
 
Rule 1: IF CO concentration is high AND SO2 concentration is high AND NO2 concentration is high AND TSP 
concentration is high THEN acceptability of I1 is very unacceptable. 
Rule 2: IF CO concentration is high AND SO2 concentration is high AND NO2 concentration is high AND TSP 
concentration is medium THEN acceptability of I1 is unacceptable. 
….. 
Rule 80: IF CO concentration is low AND SO2 concentration is low AND NO2 concentration is low AND TSP 
concentration is medium THEN acceptability of I1 is acceptable.

Step 3: Aggregating truncated conclusions. Several inferred conclusions having the same linguistic variable should be 
aggregated. Aggregation is the process by which the fuzzy sets representing the truncated conclusions of triggered rules are 
combined into a single fuzzy set. In Fig. 3, the final conclusion is aggregated by using the union of all truncated conclusions.

Step 5: Constructing a supermatrix. By reiterating step 4, all influence weights can be acquired to ultimately form an 
unweighted supermatrix, as presented in Table 3. The weighted supermatrix is produced by adjusting the unweighted 
supermatrix so that the sum of the entries in each column is equal to one. In this study, the unweighted and weighted 
supermatrices are identical.  
 
Step 6: Extracting global weights. To elicit the global weights wi, the weighted supermatrix is limited by raising it to a 
sufficiently large power so that it converges into a stable supermatrix (all columns being identical), also called a limiting 
supermatrix. Table 4 constitutes the limiting supermatrix after the power of 19, showing that the global weights from w1 
to w10 are 0.077, 0.109, 0.107, 0.107, 0.275, 0.029, 0.025, 0.086, 0.108 and 0.077, respectively, being the results of 
considering dependences and influences among indicators. Solid waste (I5), especially referring to construction waste,

3. Application to Taiwan High-Speed Rail POroject) 
 
3.1 Case Description 
Taiwan, located 160-km southeast of Mainland China, is in a subtropical island with beautiful and splendid natural scenery. 
Its total area is 35,961 km2, more than 70% of which is mountainous terrain, more than half having an altitude above 1000 
meters. The population is 21.3 million, 95% of which inhabits the Western Corridor. The major metropolises are Taipei in the 
north, with a population of 6.15 million, and Kaoshiung in the south, with a population of 2.71 million. Other cities along the 
Western Corridor are Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan. In 1987, in view of the deteriorating quality and saturation of 
transportation in the Western Corridor, the Taiwan Transportation Bureau was appointed by the Executive Yuan to undertake a 
‘Feasibility Study for a High-Speed Rail System in the Western Corridor.’ The aim of this study was to improve the 
transportation service in this area and coordinate with the metropolitan rapid transport system plan for constructing a complete 
transportation network.  
 
After almost 13 years of preparation and planning, the construction work on the Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) system 
began on March 27, 2000. The THSR project, the route of which is mapped in Fig. 5, is not only one of the most challenging 
infrastructure projects in the world to date but also the largest private-sector-invested public construction project concurrently. 
The total construction investment needed is approximately USD 15 billion. The planned system is 344.68 kms in length, 
including 252 kms of overpasses and 48 kms of tunnels, for which revenue service is projected to commence by the end of 
2006. The THSR line runs from Taipei to Kaohsiung, passing 14 major cities and counties and 77 townships and regions. In 
the earliest phase, eight stations located in Taipei, Banciao, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung, will 
be operational. Four additional stations (Nangang, Miaoli, Changhua, and Yunlin Stations) will be built in a later phase.  
 
For preventing a lateral impact on the adjacent environment along the THSR line within the construction and operation 
stages, the Taiwan Transportation Bureau conducted an environmental impact assessment report concerning the natural, 
biological, social and economical impacts, including 20 subjects within the years from 1990 to 1994. The Environmental

(2) Overall Eevaluation via FANP 
The acceptabilities for the other eight indicators are also inferred through respective sets of fuzzy rules. Table 7 (middle 10 
columns) shows the outcomes of fuzzy reasoning. In the northern section, water (I2), noise (I4), terrestrial (I6) and aquatic (I7) 
did not reach minimum acceptance, even when the mitigation measures were performed. In central section, water (I2), noise 
(I4) and aquatic (I7) were below minimum acceptance, despite the application of certain mitigation measures. The southern  
section had results similar to those of the central section except for much less construction waste. Moreover, the consequences 
of the entire line sums weighted the inferred conclusions for the three sections in light of the rail-length proportion. It should 
be noted that a comprehensive plan for construction-waste management, including 29 landfills, can successfully solve the 
problem of 18.62 million m^3 and transform the unacceptable PIWOM situation into an acceptable PIWM condition.   
 
Finally, the overall evaluation results of the FANP are shown in the last column in Table 7. In the construction phase 
without mitigation measures, the acceptabilities are all below the minimum, ranging from 50.62 to 58.63; however, these
