Introduction 
Measurement of the quality characteristic in the semiconductor manufacturing has become very 
expansive and taken time when the technology of semiconductor products is driving into nano scale (Su et al 
(2011)). Metrology delay problem makes the real-time SPC unrealistic and effective in-situ Run-to-Run 
feedback adjustment disabled. Tracking process performance depends solely on monitoring sensor data of the 
equipment. Sensor variables are collected per second during the course of each runs, known as "profiles". 
Data in the form of profile presented special opportunities and challenges for statistical monitoring and recipe 
adjustment.  Profile monitoring has attracted much scholarly attention (e.g., Kang and Albin (2000), Kim et 
al. (2003), Chang and Gan (2006), Zou et al. (2006), Zhu and Lin (2010), Mahmoud et al. (2007), Zou et al. 
(2007)). Noorossana, Amiri,  and Soleimani (2008) showed significant impact on the performance of the 
process monitoring when the profiles are sample-to-sample correlated. Jensen, Birch and Woodall (2008) 
proposed a mixed linear model to describe sample-to-sample correlation and within profile variation was 
described by an AR(1)-type correlation matrix. Lee et al. (2011) demonstrated the profile monitoring by an 
etching process in semiconductor manufacturing. They pointed out that the profile variations are not only 
coming from “pure” noise, but also caused by “intrinsic” causes.  They proposed the level-shift model to 
describe the sample-to-sample (profile-to-profile) correlation by parting the intrinsic causes from the profile 
variations.  
Most of these researches about the profile monitoring are in the statistical view. The profile data how to 
be generated from the process is less considered. In practice, the profile of semiconductor manufacturing 
process is generating by an automatic controller for a desired target. Hence, in this article, the profiles are 
described by a PI controller. The parameters of the controller are used to identify the long-term aging and 
short-term effect; and residuals of the proposal model  
 
Motivating Example 
 
The motivating example of an industrial etching process contained 364 wafers from 16 lots is first 
presented in Lee et al. (2011). Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) show the profile plots of variable V3 at step 9 for 
all 364 wafers and 25 wafers of a specific lot, respectively. The x-axis represents the synchronized profile 
points in the duration of the step 9. Figure 1(c) shows the mean centered profiles, which are the deviations of 
individual profiles from the mean profile, of V3 at step 9. It seems that there are two kinds of system variation 
in profiles variations: sample-to-sample variation and with-in profile variation. Lee et al. (2011) regarded that 
the sample-to-sample variation is caused the long-term aging showed in Figure 1(a) and the ``first wafer" 
effect showed in Figure 1(b). Moreover, the ``on-off" action causes the with-in profile correlation showed in 
Figure 1(c), there are up-down or down-up signatures at the beginning periods of each wafer at this step. Lee 
et al. (2011) proposed the level-shift method to describe the system variation, and provided a health index 
based on the residuals of their proposed model to detect faulty wafers. However, their approach was derived 
only based on the signatures of the profiles. they didn't consider the mechanism of the process operating to 
generate those profiles. Although the level-shift model has successfully identified the sample to sample

Base on (3), the first term on the right-hand side is to describe the system variation of a profile due to the 
feedback control action. And, the second term on the right-hand side is due to the process disturbances. In 
semiconductor manufacturing process, the recipe control is very complicate and different in every steps and 
for every sensor variables. Hence, the forms of    H B C B in (3) are hard to manage in a foundry or an 
OEM company. For simplicity, we use the well-known and very popular PI (proportional (P) and integral (I)) 
controller to approximate the feedback controller (2) by taking

Figure 3: The framework of profiles analysis 
 
Figure 3 shows the framework of analysis of profile data. Since lengths of the original profiles vary from 
wafer to wafer, they were synchronized by Akima splines (Akima (1970)). In this paper, we focus on the 
variations decomposition by the PI approximation formula. The profile variations can separate into the system 
variations and process disturbances. The system variations will be described by the parameters of PI equation

(b) Within Profile Correlation,

(d) Disturbances.  
The recipe effect can be expressed by the mean profile of each variable. PI formula are used to describe 
the within profile correlation and process deterministic effect. After eliminating the intrinsic causes of a 
profile variation, the reminder variation will be coming from unknown process disturbances without any 
specific patterns against the time points. Hence, the conventional multivariate process monitoring statistics, 
Hotelling's 2T is suggested by the residuals.  The proposed model can provide immediate comprehensive 
information of the process; it is useful to adjust the recipe by R2R without metrology delay.

題目為 “Profile Monitoring of Batch Processes with PI Controllers in

利用空檔逛了一下。 
 
二、與會心得 
這是第二次出席國際會議，這種面對面的研究交流比用報告方式更容易產生互動，
增進與國際學者研究交流的機會。第一次用 oral present的方式並沒有得到聽者任
何回應，感到相當挫折，有兩個原因: 投影片準備不夠好以及英語表達的能力差。
所以這次改用 poster方式報告我的研究內容，直接有興趣的研究人員討論，並將
poster的內容作有系統的編排。但是海報在紐約機場被同行的朋友弄丟了，所幸，
會場備有簡易的影印設備，大致解決了這個問題, 其他都算是順利的。這次一共算

論文摘要 
Title: Profile Monitoring of Batch Processes with PI Controllers in Semiconductor Manufacturing 
 
Abstract: A modern semiconductor manufacturing line contains hundreds of sequential batch processing 
stages. Each of these operation stages consists of many steps carried out by expensive tools with several PI 
controllers to adjust the recipes, which are monitored by numerous sensors capable of sampling at intervals of 
seconds. The heterogeneous variations at different profile points are mainly due to on-off recipe actions of the 
PI controllers at specific points. In addition, the analysis of these profiles is further complicated by long-term 
trends due to tool aging and short-term effects specific to the first wafer in a lot-cycle. Statistical process 
control methods that fail to take these effects into consideration will lead to frequent false alarms. A 
systematic method is proposed to address these challenges. At first, each of these PI controllers is described 
by a state space model, its output matrix is used to capture and remove intrinsic variations due to long-term 
aging trends and the short-term first-wafer effects. The residuals are used to formulate a health index, and this 
index can be used to monitor the health of the equipment and detect faulty wafers efficiently.
