and more realistic dam-breach experiments similar to

instrumentation techniques that will allow us to 
resolve the internal flow dynamics in even greater

1. Background and objectives 
The long term objective of the proposed work is to better understand the geomorphic events 
which episodically deliver massive amounts of granular material into Taiwan rivers. 
Commonly triggered by typhoon storms, such events typically take the form of shallow 
landslides along upper slopes, debris flow surges down steep tributaries, then lateral influx 
into torrential rivers. At each stage of this transformation, the flow behavior depends on the 
availability of water and granular material, the slope and erodibility of the bed and banks, as 
well as the properties of the liquid and solid materials, in ways that are incompletely 
understood.  
 
A major difficulty is that, unlike Newtonian or standard non-Newtonian homogeneous fluids, 
the shear rate response of liquid-granular mixtures does not depend solely on the applied 
shear stress, but also on normal stresses and internal density gradients. Via Terzaghi’s 
effective stress principle, the normal stress and pore water pressure exert a major influence on 
the resistance to deformation of liquid-granular mixtures. Depending on the effective stress 
and rate of deformation, in particular, sheared granular materials can exhibit either slowly 
evolving networks of contact forces spanning multiple grains, or rapid binary collisions 
between individual grains.  
 
By limiting the development of turbulent eddies, on the other hand, internal density gradients 
due to variations in flow composition exert another major influence. Due to these peculiar 
features, liquid-granular mixtures are able to flow over their own loose deposits, which they 
can erode, accrete, or find equilibrium with, over a large range of slopes. Although they are 
known to be important, such features are currently not included in models used to estimate 
upland hazards from shallow landslides, debris surges and torrential flows, limiting their 
predictive ability. 
 
To address these issues, the three-year research combined mathematical modeling, laboratory 
experiments, and field application. Mathematical modeling is used to link the global dynamics 
of geomorphic flows to their local rheological behavior. Laboratory experiments are used to 
inform and check models, using imaging measurements of liquid-granular mixtures flowing 
over their own deposits. To check the applicability of the resulting models, finally, they are 
applied to simple field cases of practical interest, including flows past natural dams.

For the second year, we focused on the development of internal imaging techniques aimed at 
resolving granular and fluid motions inside liquid-granular flows. Results include detailed 
maps of granular concentration, granular velocity, and liquid velocity over transverse 
cross-sections across three-dimensional liquid-granular flows (Figure 3).

the near‐wall grains by a transverse laser light sheet (see
Figure 1). About 106 velocity vectors and 105 laser hits
were acquired for each run, and collected into grids of
non‐overlapping bins to obtain distributions of velocity and
distance to wall (Figures 2b–2d). Contrasting with the sta-
tionary bed, the bed‐load layer is characterized by very high
velocity gradients du/dz (Figure 2b), up to 50 s−1. At the base
of the bed‐load layer, we observe a distinct transition across
which slowly sheared, densely packed grains become highly
agitated and loosely dispersed. This is manifested by a
marked increase in spread of the normal‐to‐bed velocity
distribution (Figure 2c), and a jump in the number of laser
hits detected away from the side wall (Figure 2d).
[5] The frequency of recorded laser hits in relation to
distance from the wall is used to estimate granular con-
centration, following the measurement principle proposed
by Spinewine et al. [2011]. The idea is that laser hits away
from the wall become more frequent when the concentration
decreases. More precisely, the granular concentration can be
related to the mean free path m of light rays in the dispersion
using the formula [Fraccarollo and Marion, 1995]

where particles are approximated by spheres of diameter D
(see auxiliary material for an analysis of shape and orien-
tation effects). In Spinewine et al. [2011], the mean free path
m was determined from the mean distance to wall of
observed laser hits, an approach well suited for moderate to
high concentrations. For low concentrations, however, light
attenuation in the liquid starts to affect the mean distance to
wall. In that case, a better indicator is provided by the fre-
quency m/n of laser hits per image frames detected within a
certain distance ymax from the wall. To combine the ranges
of both indicators, we estimate the concentration c as the
value maximizing the likelihood of jointly observing mean
y (restricted to data y < ymax) and frequency m/n (see
auxiliary material for details). The resulting concentration
profiles c(z) cover both the dilute upper part and dense lower
part of the transport layer. Only in the underlying bed do
statistics become poor: there the stationary laser sheet illu-
minates motionless particles instead of averaging over
multiple configurations of moving particles.
[6] We present in Figure 3 the measured profiles of mean
longitudinal velocity u(z) and volumetric granular concen-
tration c(z) for a series of 11 runs conducted at width W2
and target discharge Q2. Profile data were obtained from
non‐overlapping bins of thickness Dz = 3.5 mm. Estimated
from three repeat runs conducted under identical conditions,
root‐mean‐square errors on velocity and concentration are
eu = 0.019 m/s and ec = 0.060 m
3/m3 respectively. For

and recirculation system; (b) measurement section showing
the laser‐illuminated slice (in red, located 1.7 m upstream of
the flume outlet) and synchronized orthogonal and oblique
cameras. Complementing the imaging measurements, a
point gauge was used to measure the water level at the sec-
tion centerline, and a periscope was inserted through floor
openings at the section centerline and at 16 mm from both
walls to ascertain the highest levels at which grains
remained stationary inside the bulk. Bed levels ascertained
in this way near the walls and at the centre were found to
differ by less than one grain diameter D, indicating a high
degree of bed thickness uniformity over width. An incli-
nometer, an electromagnetic flowmeter, and an outlet trap
were used to measure the channel inclination b, total flow
rate Q, and solid transport QS.

particle configurations. Consistent with recent measurements
by Matoušek [2009], the granular concentration slightly
above the bed is less than the bed concentration value. It
also varies systematically from run to run, increasing with
the Shields stress ^ . Measured profiles for the other series
(see auxiliary material) exhibit similar trends.
[9] To examine these trends in a quantitative way, we
introduce the following set of layer structure parameters
(Figures 5a and 5b). Following Hsu et al. [2004], we define
the top of the bed‐load transport layer as the elevation ~z
where the granular concentration drops to value c = 0.08, at
which particle interdistance becomes equal to the particle
diameter. The velocity at the top of the bed‐load layer
is then obtained by interpolating measured profile u(z) at
elevation ~z. The thickness of the bed‐load transport layer
is defined as d = ~z − z0. Distinct from bed level z0, we define
the elevation z of the base of the transport layer as the zero
intercept of a linear fit to the velocity profile in the range
0.1 < u(z)/~u < 0.9. The difference " = z − z0 is the thickness
of the gradual ramp transition connecting the linear part of
the velocity profile to the motionless bed. Finally, the basal
granular concentration c is obtained by extrapolating to level
z a linear fit to the concentration profile c(z) in the range
0.08 < c < 0.4. Together with bed level z0, the structure
variables ", ~u, c and d capture the main features of our
measured profiles. In Figures 5c–5f, we plot the four
structure variables against Shields stress for all 48 experi-
mental runs.
3. Constitutive Relations
[10] We now attempt to derive constitutive relations
accounting for the above layer structure observations. As
suspected by Hanes and Inman [1985], a transitional sub‐
layer of small thickness " = z − z0 appears to form between
the rigid bed and the region where dispersed grains ran-
domly collide. Invoking dense granular rheology [Jop et al.,
2006], the dependence of thickness " on Shields stress ^ can
be approximated by (see Figure 5c)
"
D
 tan∞  tan0
c0 tan0 tan∞
^ : ð4Þ
Here tana0 and tana∞ are internal friction coefficients at
zero and high shear rates, respectively, for which dry
granular flow experiments [Jop et al., 2006] indicate tana∞ /
tana0 ≈ 1.7. Thickness " increases linearly with Shields
stress ^ . It can thus be expected to become more important
at steeper slopes, as debris flow conditions are approached.
In the present experiments, it already accounts for up to 20%
of the transport layer thickness. To obtain simple constitu-
tive relations, however, we now assume that the concen-
tration drops from bed value c0 to basal value c across a
sharp interface. We thus neglect thickness " and approxi-
mate z ≈ z0. Likewise, we suppose that velocity and con-
centration profiles in the layer are linear, and neglect the
elevation difference needed for the concentration to drop
from 0.08 to 0 at the top of the bed‐load layer.
[11] We make the following physical hypotheses (see
auxiliary material for a more detailed derivation): 1) Through-
out the bed‐load layer, the collisional normal stress s′ balances
the submerged weight of overlying grains [Bagnold, 1956].
At the base, therefore, ′ = 12 c(rS − rW)gd cosb. 2) Fluid tur-
bulence contributes to shear stresses elsewhere in the layer.
At the base, however, collisions alone transmit the total shear
stress  = (rWH + 12 c(rS − rW)d)g sinb to the bed [Berzi and
Jenkins, 2008]. From kinetic theory [Savage and Jeffrey,
1981; Jenkins and Hanes, 1998], therefore,

p c(2 − c)1/2/(1 − c)3/2 represents the influence
of granular concentration on the frequency of collisions. The
influence of liquid inertia on immersed collisions is introduced
via added mass a(c) = 12(1 + 2c)/(1 − c) [Armanini et al., 2005].
3) At the bed, entrainment of static grains into the bed‐load
layer is controlled by the Coulomb yield criterion  = R′,
where R = tana0 [Hanes and Bowen, 1985]. 4) Within the bed‐
load layer, density and velocity gradients adjust to an equilib-
rium state, characterized by a definite value of the gradient
Richardson number [Turner, 1973; Pugh and Wilson, 1999]

Turner [1973] proposed that gravity‐driven stratified shear
flows self‐adjust in this way near the threshold of instability,
and obtained value G ≈ 0.058 (adopted hereafter) from density
current experiments [Ellison and Turner, 1959]. Similar values
of the gradient Richardson number were later measured in sheet
flow experiments [Pugh and Wilson, 1999].
[12] Together, these assumptions suffice to derive consti-
tutive relations for intense bed‐load. Introducing dimension-
less thickness

The bed‐load layer thickness, top velocity, and Shields stress
^ can thus be calculated explicitly from parameter c, the
basal granular concentration. Conversely, one can deduce
c from ^ by finding the root of an implicit equation. The
resulting theoretical curves for u^, c, and 
^ are plotted in
Figures 5d–5f, together with the experimental data. For the
top velocity (Figure 5d), we obtain from (8) and (9) the
relation u^ =

hand, are not expressible in power law form. Only for mod-
erate Shields stresses do they approximate scalings 
^ / ^1/2
and c / ^1/2. For more intense bed‐load, the relations for
c and 
^ deviate inward and outward, respectively. We empha-
size that the curves represent predictions, not fits, since the
constitutive relations include no tuning coefficient. For all three
variables u^, c, and 
^, calculated curves are in good agreement
with the experimental data. For thickness 
^ (Figure 5f), the
predicted curve also concurs with previous experiments
[Sumer et al., 1996] and with results from numerical simu-
lations [Hsu et al., 2004].
[13] Finally, integrating the product of linear profiles
c(z) and u(z) over layer thickness d yields result q^S = 16 cu^

downstream of the dam occurs in a valley of ﬁxed geome-
try. Exceptions occur when ﬂoods reach such magnitude
that they become valley-forming ﬂoods. A well-documented
example is the Ha! Ha! Lake breakout ﬂood of 1996, which
caused channel avulsion and extreme valley widening far
downstream of the dam breach [Lapointe et al., 1998;
Brooks and Lawrence, 1999; Capart et al., 2007b]. Few
cases, however, feature such extreme geomorphic changes
away from the dam breach itself, and the assumption that
the downstream valley is rigid typically constitutes a good
ﬁrst approximation. The breaching and routing problems
can therefore be addressed in turn.
[4] Floods produced by breaching can reach peak dis-
charges well in excess of the rate of water inﬂow into the
lake. They tend however to develop more gradually than
ﬂoods produced by instantaneous dam removal. Breaching
may also stop before complete drainage of the impounded
lake, even in the absence of nonerodible controls constrain-
ing breach incision at the base of the dam. During incision,
the breaching channel simultaneously increases in depth,
width, and length. The required transport of dam material
by ﬂowing water then limits the pace and ultimate depth of
incision. Among other factors, the lakeward migration of
the breach crest along the upstream face of the dam can
contribute signiﬁcantly to lengthening the breaching chan-
nel and pacing the breaching process. A difﬁculty associ-
ated with these mechanisms is that neither the pace, width,
or ultimate depth of incision, nor the corresponding outﬂow
hydrograph, are known in advance. They are instead out-
comes of the breaching process, which must be related to
the geometrical and material properties of the dam and to
the storage characteristics of the lake.
[5] Various approaches to the breaching problem have
been proposed [for a recent review, see Wu et al., 2011b].
Partial solutions can be obtained by assuming that at least
one of the variables governing breach incision is known.
Variables assumed known by previous researchers have
included the ultimate depth of incision (related to dam
height in the case of a nonerodible base), incision rate, and/
or duration of incision [Wetmore and Fread, 1981; Froeh-
lich, 1995; Walder and O’Connor, 1997]. The remaining
variables can then be determined based on empirical or
physical laws. The alternative is to set up a more complete
model in which all variables evolve from prescribed geo-
metrical and material initial conditions. Models of this type
include the well-known BREACH model developed by
Fread [1988, 1998]. The models by Fread [1988], Walder
and O’Connor [1997], Macchione [2008], and Hou [2009]
solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time. More
complex models solving partial differential equations have
also been proposed [Tingsanchali and Chinnarasri, 2001;
Liu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012]. So far, however, models
of this type have required numerical solutions implemented
as computer codes. An advantage of such codes is that they
can accommodate ﬂexible assumptions regarding geometry
and material transport. On the downside, they constitute
black box models that must be run multiple times to gain a
sense of how model outcomes depend on the problem data.
[6] The principal aim of the present work is to construct
a breach evolution model that can predict the key variables
from initial conditions, yet remains simple enough to be
solved analytically. The required idealizations, motivated
in greater detail below, are illustrated in Figure 2. An erodi-
ble dam of triangular shape is assumed, with upstream and
Figure 1. Aerial view of the Namaxia debris-dammed lake, Southern Taiwan, formed during Typhoon
Morakot in August 2009 (source: Taiwan Forestry Bureau).
CAPART: GRADUAL DAM BREACHING
2
[9] It turns out that the hydrograph of special form
obtained as solution to the breaching problem is ideally
suited for kinematic wave routing. Using the method of
characteristics [Whitham, 1974; Hunt, 1984a, 1984b], the
ﬂood wave proﬁle can be calculated in a straightforward
way. The main difﬁculty concerns the wave front at the
downstream edge of the wave. The path of this moving
front must be found as part of the solution, making this
another moving boundary problem. In this case, the prob-
lem can be solved by applying the Gauss theorem to the
x; tð Þ plane. In contrast with the dam break solution
obtained earlier by Hunt [1984a], the new solution features
an upstream hydrograph that attains its peak discharge
gradually instead of instantaneously. This has a substantial
inﬂuence on peak attenuation (or lack thereof) downstream
of the dam.
[10] For both the dam breaching and ﬂood routing prob-
lems, explicit analytical solutions can be derived. These
solutions complement numerical models by being more
transparent to interpret, and could be used to validate nu-
merical algorithms. They are also easy to compute, with
minimal data requirements. It must be checked, however,
that the results obtained are reasonable and approximate
well actual breaching events. In what follows, governing
equations and the adopted simplifying assumptions are ﬁrst
presented (section 2). Next, solutions for dam breaching
(section 3) and ﬂood routing (section 4) are derived. For
testing, the solutions are applied to an exceptionally well-
documented case: the breaching of the Tangjiashan land-
slide dam, in Sichuan, in June 2008 (section 5). For this
event, both the breaching behavior of the dam and the
downstream propagation of the ﬂood can be examined,
thanks to measured data documented in two papers by Liu
et al. [2009, 2010]. Further comparisons are then made
with a broader variety of reported ﬁeld cases (section 6). A
synthesis is proposed in the conclusions (section 7).

where zL tð Þ is the evolving lake water level, AL the surface

breaching outﬂow dominates, we further neglect lake
inﬂow and assume QU ¼ 0. Assuming outﬂow through a
rectangular breaching channel of width bB and crest level
zC tð Þ, the outﬂow discharge through the breach is assumed
governed by the broad-crested weir equation [Henderson,
1966]

[12] Although in practice the breach width is expected to
evolve as incision proceeds [Fread, 1988; Coleman et al.,
2002], we assume for simplicity a constant effective width
bB during the process. We will further assume that breach-
ing starts (deﬁning time t¼ 0) when the lake level zL rises
just above the initial dam crest level zC 0ð Þ ¼ zD.
[13] Before incision, the dam is assumed triangular in
shape, with upstream and downstream faces of inclina-
tions RD and SD, respectively, and initial dam elevation
zD. Incision is assumed unconstrained by the presence of
any nonerodible substrate at the base of the dam. The
time and space-varying bottom elevation z x; tð Þ of the
breaching channel is assumed governed by the Exner
equation for sediment mass balance [see e.g., Paola and
Voller, 2005]

upstream discharge hydrograph. The shape, magnitude and
time scale of this hydrograph, however, control the behav-
ior of the downstream ﬂood wave. Like the dam breaching
problem, the ﬂood routing problem involves a moving
boundary, hence both problems constitute moving boundary
problems [Crank, 1987]. Explicit analytical solutions for
such problems can only be expected in special circumstances.
Fortunately, the above equations and simplifying assump-
tions deﬁne circumstances for which solutions do indeed
exist. In the next sections, these solutions will be derived sep-
arately for the dam breaching and ﬂood routing problems.

[22] Typically, such a transformation is used to deal with
a time-varying diffusion coefﬁcient of know time depend-

long proﬁle z x; ð Þ of the outﬂow channel without yet
knowing how the breaching discharge QB tð Þ varies in time.
For the case of a triangular dam, the solution of the steady
rate diffusion equation with moving upstream boundary
was derived earlier in Capart et al. [2007a]. The solution
for the time-evolving long proﬁle of the breaching channel

monotonous decrease of sigmoidal shape is obtained for
both variables, with the lake level drawdown lagging
behind the crest elevation drop. Initially, the breaching pro-
cess is self-accelerating: a drop in crest level increases the
available head, which increases the discharge and further
accelerates crest incision. Eventually, however, the process
becomes self-limiting as incision and drawdown approach
the asymptote z ¼ zD  dB, where the ultimate breach drop
dB is given by equation (59). This occurs without needing to
enforce any external constraint on erosion at the base of the
dam. Instead, lengthening of the breaching channel causes
any further incision to require more water ﬂow past the crest
than lake drawdown can provide. In between, the head dif-
ference between lake level and crest elevation attains its
maximum at time t ¼ TP given by equation (58). The breach
crest at that point has reached half its ultimate drop, and the
lake water level one quarter of its ultimate drawdown dB.
[44] The corresponding discharge hydrograph and cumu-
lative outﬂow curve are shown in Figure 6b. The discharge
through the breach QB tð Þ follows a sigmoidal rising limb to
its peak value QP, then a sigmoidal receding limb tending
asymptotically to zero. The peak is rounded and the hydro-
graph asymmetric, rising more rapidly than it wanes. The
associated cumulative outﬂow V tð Þ ¼ R t0 QB t0ð Þdt0 is a mir-
ror image of the lake level drawdown curve of Figure 6a.
When the peak discharge is reached, at time t ¼ TP, only
one quarter of the eventual water volume VB released by
the breach has exited the lake.
[45] The time evolution of the breach proﬁle is obtained
by substituting crest drop evolution
 tð Þ ¼ dB t=TPð Þ
2
1þ t=TPð Þ2
; (61)
into equation (34). Figure 6c shows the resulting long pro-
ﬁles, plotted at equally spaced time intervals. Here the dam
chosen is a symmetric dam of equal upstream and down-
stream dam face inclinations ( ¼ SD=RD ¼ 1), yielding
crest migration coefﬁcient  ¼ 0:63425. Although the ini-
tial dam shape is symmetric, the breach long proﬁle is not,
with the upstream dam face left untouched until reached by
the retrograding breach crest. The proﬁles take self-similar
shapes, with invariant inclinations along any given ray
originating from the dam apex. In particular, a horizontal
channel slope is maintained at the upstream end of the
incising channel as it retreats lakeward along the adversely
sloping upstream face of the dam. Although the proﬁles are
self-similar in space, their evolution is nonuniform in time.
The pace of incision accelerates at ﬁrst, then gradually slows,
converging asymptotically towards a proﬁle of maximum
incision. The process stops on its own without requiring com-
plete drainage of the lake. Since no additional approximation
was made during the solution process, it can be checked that
the above curves and proﬁles are exact solutions of the sim-
pliﬁed partial and ODEs assumed earlier in section 2.

also be checked that the resulting front velocity does indeed
satisfy shock condition (67), which was implicitly taken
into account by integrating the divergence form of the gov-
erning equation around the shock. Together, results (74)
and (82) provide a complete solution to the dimensionless
mathematical problem (64)–(67). For applications, conver-
sion to dimensional variables must be done using formulas
(62) and (63).
[59] The analytical solutions obtained for the wave rout-
ing problem are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9. Wave pro-
ﬁles and hydrographs at equally spaced times and distances
down valley are shown in dimensionless form in Figure 8.
The evolving long proﬁle (Figure 8a) features a discontinu-
ous jump at the wavefront, with a front amplitude that ini-
tially increases, then decreases as the front propagates
downstream. It takes a ﬁnite time for the peak discharge to
enter the domain at the upstream end (at dimensionless
time t^ ¼ 1), then for this wave peak to catch up with the
wavefront (at dimensionless time t^ ¼ 2). The peak is there-
after absorbed into the front shock. It is after this occurs
that the front amplitude starts to decrease. Discharge hydro-
graphs at successive stations downstream of the dam are
illustrated in Figure 8b. The discharge at the upstream end
(x^ ¼ 0) is given by the breaching hydrograph derived in
section 3. At stations downstream, some time must elapse
before wave arrival. Due to the discontinuous wavefront, a
sharp rise occurs when the wave arrives. At stations sufﬁ-
ciently close to the dam, the wave peak lags behind the

[69] Peak arrival times can therefore be matched by
choosing as effective rating curve coefﬁcient mV for the
valley the average value
mV ¼ b1m1 þ b2m2 þ b3m3
b1 þ b2 þ b3 : (90)
[70] Based on equation (10), ﬁnally, this calibrated rating
curve coefﬁcient is used to calculate the friction coefﬁcient
f for the valley using the formula
f ¼ 8gb2VSVm3V : (91)
[71] Although different widths are taken at different
downstream cross sections, the same slope and friction
coefﬁcient are assumed everywhere down the valley. Table
2 lists the parameter values at each cross section, estimated
from Liu et al. [2009], as well as the composite values for
the valley obtained by the above formulas.
[72] Results for the ﬂood routing problem are presented in
Figures 13 and 14. Figure 13a shows the predicted and meas-
ured discharge hydrographs at the three gauging stations.
Calculations of the transition distance xT using formula (85)
yields the result xT ¼ 133 km. Since all three stations are
located upstream of this point (the last station, at Mianyang,
is at position x3 ¼ 74.9 km), the theory predicts that no peak
attenuation should yet occur. This is consistent with the
measurements, which indicate peak discharges of 6540,
6210, and 6100 m3/s at the three stations. Wave arrival times
are also well predicted. At Tongkou and Mianyang, how-
ever, the observed lag between wave arrival and ﬂood peak
is longer than predicted by the kinematic wave solution.
[73] Measured and predicted depth hydrographs at the
three gauging stations are presented in Figure 13b. To
account for the inﬂuence of local valley widening and nar-
rowing on stage variations, depth at each station is calcu-
lated using the local width of the river channel, i.e.,

but the other variables are those obtained assuming a uni-
form valley. The same principle allows practitioners to
forecast downstream stage rise from measurements at
upstream gauging stations [Piesold, 1991]. Using equation
(92), the depth magniﬁcation observed in the relatively nar-
row gorge at Tongkou station (see Figure 10d) is well cap-
tured in spite of having routed the ﬂood discharge down a
uniform valley. The shape of the arriving front, however, is
less well described. The discontinuous jump resulting from
the kinematic wave approximation is replaced in reality by
a more gradual rise. A more complete description account-
ing for the diffusive inﬂuence of depth gradients would
round off the shock, and bring the solution closer to the
measurements. This could possibly be done using the
method of matched asymptotic expansions proposed by
Hunt [1984b].
[74] Figure 14 depicts the predicted and measured ﬂood
propagation in the x; tð Þ plane. Predictions for ﬂood front
and ﬂood peak arrival times are in good agreement with the
observations at the three gauging stations (where the ﬂood
front is taken to arrive when discharges ﬁrst exceed 20 %
of the peak). For the ﬂood peak, the present kinematic
wave calculations also agree with the dynamic wave calcu-
lations reported by Tang [2012], performed using the
SOBEK software. Those calculations, however, predict

reasonable values for each of the parameters are provided in
Table 3, to allow an assessment of the uncertainties surround-
ing their determination. Comparison between the Ha! Ha!
case (Table 3) and the Tangjiashan case (Table 1) indicates
similar areas for the two lakes. In both cases, the dams had
steeper faces downstream than upstream. The Tangjiashan
dam was considerably steeper, however, and this is the princi-
pal reason why it released a much higher peak discharge.

drainage ended when the lake level and breach crest
dropped to elevation z ¼ 370 m, close to the predicted ulti-
mate breach level zD  dB. For the breaching discharge
(Figure 15c), the time to peak of approximately 12 h is well
predicted, but the observed hydrograph is narrower than the
predicted one. The peak discharge value, of course, is pre-
cisely but unsurprisingly matched, because it was used to
calibrate transport coefﬁcient K. Although no hydrographs
were recorded in the downstream Ha! Ha! river valley,
Brooks and Lawrence [1999] estimated a peak discharge in
the range 1080–1260 m3/s at a cross section 27 km down-
stream of the dam. This is close to the peak value 1010 m3/s
at the breach resulting from lake drainage and upstream
inﬂow, augmented by contributions from a few minor tribu-
taries between km 0 and km 27 [Capart et al., 2007b]. This
again underscores that little to no ﬂood peak attenuation
should be expected for conﬁned valleys, unless one consid-
ers stations very far downstream of the breached dam.
6.2. Other Field Events
[78] Data for additional ﬁeld events are provided in
Costa [1988], Walder and O’Connor [1997], and Peng and
Zhang [2012]. For most of these events, however, the data
available are not sufﬁciently complete to allow compari-
sons with the present model. Among all documented dam
breaches, only six events were identiﬁed for which dis-
charge hydrographs at the breach or sufﬁciently close
downstream were recorded. In addition to the Tangjiashan
and Ha! Ha! cases, hydrographs were recorded for the
1974 Mayunmarca landslide dam breach, Montaro River,
Peru [Lee and Duncan, 1975], and for three lahar dam
breaches from Mapanuepe Lake, the Philippines, following
the 1991 Pinatubo volcano eruption [Umbal and Rodolfo,
1996]. Parameter values and sources for the six events are
listed in Table 4.
[79] For comparisons with this broader dataset, it is con-
venient to make relations independent of the transport coef-
ﬁcient K and dam face inclinations, by eliminating product
K1=2SD between equations (57), (58), and (59). This yields
the following equations for the time to peak and ultimate
breach drop as functions of peak discharge QP, lake surface
area AL, and breach width bB :

where tP is the observed time at which peak discharge was
attained. In Figure 16, the six recorded discharge hydro-
graphs are plotted together in the reduced form (95). Plotted
in this way, the hydrographs for the different ﬁeld events
collapse reasonably close to each other, and to the predicted
analytical hydrograph of equation (53). Recorded rates of
variation, however, do not precisely match the predicted
ones. The rising limb of the Mayunmarca hydrograph, in
particular, is signiﬁcantly slower than expected. For most of
the other ﬁeld events, by contrast, the observed hydrographs
are narrower than predicted. As discussed earlier for the
Tangjiashan case, factors which could explain this discrep-
ancy include variations of lake area with lake level, and lim-
its on dam incision due to coarsening or base level control.

CAPART: GRADUAL DAM BREACHING

580 B. Spinewine and H. Capart
measured by Capart & Fraccarollo (2011) in intense bed-load experiments. These
data were found to be consistent with three mechanisms: Coulomb yield at the bed,
as proposed by Bagnold (1956) and Hanes & Bowen (1985); immersed granular
collisions at the base, governed by the theories of Savage & Jeffrey (1981) and Jenkins
& Hanes (1998); and equilibration between shear rate and density stratiﬁcation, as
hypothesized by Turner (1973) and observed by Pugh & Wilson (1999).
The above and other studies devoted to the internal dynamics of intense bed-
load layers have so far been limited to steady uniform ﬂows in closed ducts and
open channels (Sumer et al. 1996; Capart & Fraccarollo 2011), or oscillatory ﬂows
in U-shaped ducts (Asano 1995). In the present work, we turn our attention to
prototypical examples of unsteady non-uniform ﬂow: dam-break water waves released
over erodible granular beds. Such ﬂows have been investigated experimentally by a
number of authors (Capart & Young 1998; Fraccarollo & Capart 2002; Spinewine
2005; Leal, Ferreira & Cardoso 2006, 2009; Spinewine & Zech 2007; Carrivick,
Jones & Keevil 2011; Goutie`re, Soares-Fraza˜o & Zech 2011), and have emerged as
benchmark cases to test models of severe geomorphic ﬂows (Fraccarollo, Capart &
Zech 2003; Cao et al. 2004; Wu & Wang 2007; Leal, Ferreira & Cardoso 2010; El
Kadi Abderrezzak & Paquier 2011; Li & Duffy 2011; Zhang & Duan 2011; Greco
et al. 2012; Postacchini et al. 2012; Serrano-Pacheco, Murillo & Garcia-Navarro 2012;
Zhang, Duan & Strelkoff 2013). So far, however, these models and their comparison
with experiments have been restricted to the depth-averaged dynamics of the ﬂows,
without resolving detailed proﬁles of velocity and granular concentration over depth.
Moreover, the models proposed have had to rely on adjustable coefﬁcients to match
the experimentally observed behaviours.
In the present work, we aim to address the above limitations by combining
experiment and theory. First, we acquire detailed proﬁles of velocity and granular
concentration from laboratory dam-break experiments. The set-up used for this purpose
(Spinewine 2005; Spinewine & Zech 2007) improves on prior experimental efforts
(Capart & Young 1998; Fraccarollo & Capart 2002) by using a longer ﬂume
and adopting a fast gate-lowering mechanism that produces sharply deﬁned initial
conditions. In addition to wave proﬁle data reported in previous work (Spinewine &
Zech 2007), we perform a re-analysis of archived video footage to obtain velocity
maps of increased resolution. Moreover, we use the new laser technique of Spinewine
et al. (2011) to acquire the ﬁrst detailed measurements of evolving concentration
proﬁles at selected cross-sections. Some intermediate results of this effort have been
reported in Spinewine, Aleixo & Capart (2011a,b). Next, we develop a shallow
ﬂow theory that matches the level of detail achieved in the experiments. Extending
the descriptions of Fraccarollo & Capart (2002) and Capart & Fraccarollo (2011),
the theory produces detailed predictions of wave elevation, velocity and granular
concentration during the development of the dam-break waves. For the calculations,
we opt for the numerical approach of Fraccarollo et al. (2003) instead of the
analytical approach of Fraccarollo & Capart (2002), in order to capture the signiﬁcant
inﬂuence of frictional momentum losses on the development of the wavefront. Without
any parameter adjustment, we then compare the theoretical predictions with the
experimental measurements.
The paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, § 2 describes the
experiments and imaging measurement methods used. Section 3 presents the theory
and the numerical methods used to calculate solutions. Detailed comparisons between
the theory and the experiments are implemented in § 4, before conclusions are
proposed in § 5.

Coarse, lightweight PVC grains are used for most experiments. The particles are
white in colour, cylindrical in shape with approximately equal height and base
diameter, and an equivalent spherical diameter D = 3.9 mm, measured from the bulk
volume of 1000 particles. The grains have density ρS = 1580 kg m−3 and their friction
angle is ϕ = 38◦, as estimated from the critical repose angle of a dry granular heap.
They are poured in place at loose packing to produce a bed of granular concentration
c0 ≈ 0.58. For a single experiment reported in § 4.3, the sediment bed was composed
of coarse uniform sand of grain size D = 1.8 mm, density ρS = 2680 kg m−3 and
friction angle ϕ = 30◦, packed at a bed concentration of c0 ≈ 0.53. The parameter
values are summarized in table 1.
Video footage is acquired through the ﬂume side wall using high-speed digital
cameras, then processed using special-purpose imaging algorithms. Two sets of
experiments were conducted, under the two distinct imaging conﬁgurations illustrated
in ﬁgure 1. In the ﬁrst set, a variety of ﬂow conﬁgurations were imaged from the side
under even illumination (ﬁgure 1a). In the second set, laser-illuminated cross-sections
(ﬁgure 1b) were imaged at oblique angles (ﬁgure 1c) to obtain measurements of
granular concentration and nearby velocity. The imaging methods used in each case
are described in the next section.
2.2. Imaging methods
The ﬁrst set of experiments, previously reported by Spinewine & Zech (2007), was
re-analysed for the purposes of the present work. The footage for this set was acquired
at different stations along the ﬂume, using a Dalsa DS-21-001M0150 camera oriented
normal to the side wall (ﬁgure 1a). The camera acquired 8-bit grey-level images at
a rate of 200 frames per second and a resolution of 1024 × 512 pixels. The ﬁeld
of view for each acquisition was limited to a length of 80 cm along the ﬂume.
To assemble mosaics of the ﬂow, overlapping footage was obtained from repeat
experiments conducted under identical conditions, with the camera displaced 75 cm
downstream for each experiment. Individual image sequences were then corrected for
scale and assembled into global image mosaics with a pixel resolution of ∼0.8 mm.
Their coverage goes from 1 m upstream of the gate to 3 m downstream, where the
ﬂume ends. Based on the 5 cm overlap bands, and on repeat tests conducted with

interface (short dashes), ascertained from the absolute value of the difference image between
two successive frames; (c) the same interfaces together with the velocity vectors captured by
PTV.
Finally, particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) was used to capture the motions of PVC
grains and Pliolite tracers. The adopted algorithms, described in Huang et al. (2009),
constitute improved and accelerated versions of methods originally proposed by Capart,
Young & Zech (2002). A Laplacian-of-Gaussian ﬁlter is used to highlight the particle
positions, and a path coherence criterion is used to match particles on successive
frames. The result is a large set of irregularly positioned velocity vectors (ﬁgure 3c),
with very few mismatches. The data are then distributed into non-overlapping bins to
obtain averaged velocities on a Cartesian mesh. Whereas interface capture was applied
to all the runs reported by Spinewine & Zech (2007), particle tracking was applied
only to the footage acquired in the reference ﬂat-bed conﬁguration.
For the same ﬂat-bed conﬁguration, the second set of experiments used a different
ﬂume instrumentation to acquire concentration measurements in addition to velocity
measurements. Instead of the stereo approach described in Spinewine et al. (2003), the
more recent laser-based approach of Spinewine et al. (2011) was adopted. At selected
cross-sections, a laser light sheet normal to the side wall (ﬁgure 1b) was used to
project a thin vertical stripe of bright light on to near-wall grains. The penetration
depth of this stripe was recorded during ﬂow using an oblique camera (ﬁgure 1c). The
granular concentration can then be deduced from the statistics of the laser penetration
depth. The laser used for that purpose was a 40 mW Flexpoint red diode laser, with
a fan angle of 45◦. The camera was a Photron Fastcam, acquiring 8-bit grey-level
images at a rate of 2000 frames per second and a resolution of 256 × 1024 pixels.
It was positioned at an angle of approximately 30◦ relative to the wall normal.
At each station, the corresponding camera viewpoint was calibrated by imaging a
target immersed along the ﬂume side wall. To acquire simultaneous measurements
of granular velocities, a low level of even illumination was also provided, allowing
velocity vectors to be harvested from the footage away from the laser stripe. To
avoid perturbing the concentration measurements, however, no neutrally buoyant tracer
particles were added to the clear water column.
The imaging steps applied to this set of experiments are illustrated in ﬁgure 4. The
raw image fragment of ﬁgure 4(a) shows a close-up view of the near-bed region,
imaged at an oblique angle. Near-wall grains are illuminated by the laser light sheet to

dashes) and the bed interface (short dashes), as ascertained from the video footage, are shown
as horizontal lines.
as spheres of diameter D, this length is equal to the ratio of the particle volume to
the projected particle area, dS = (2/3)D. On the other hand, dW is the mean distance
travelled through pore water before hitting the next solid particle. In ideal conditions,
this would be equal to the mean laser penetration depth. In practice, however, one
must take into account occlusion along the return path to the camera, and the possible
loss of data due to light attenuation in water when travel distances become large.
The latter effect becomes important for dilute concentrations, as encountered at the
top of bed-load layers. Occlusion is taken into account using the model described
in Spinewine et al. (2011). Light attenuation, on the other hand, is dealt with by
censoring data beyond a certain distance (ymax = 0.02 m, the dashed line in ﬁgure 4b),
then taking this censoring into account using the approach of Capart & Fraccarollo
(2011). In the auxiliary material to that paper, the resulting conversion model was
checked against Monte Carlo simulations and against the ﬂuidization cell experiments
with PVC particles conducted by Spinewine et al. (2011). The concentration proﬁle
deduced in this way from the binning map of ﬁgure 4(c) is plotted as a grey line in
ﬁgure 4(e).
In ﬁgure 5, measured proﬁles from different experiments are compared with each

conﬁned. Most important is the assumption made at the base of the bed-load layer.
Previous researchers (Wilson 1987, 2005; Berzi 2011) have assumed linear proﬁles
pivoting around a ﬁxed basal value, set equal or close to the bed concentration c0.
The measurements of Capart & Fraccarollo (2011), however, have shown that the basal
concentration can be signiﬁcantly lower than the bed concentration (as also observed
by Matousˇek (2009)), and varies in a systematic way with changes in ﬂow conditions.
In this work, a basal concentration c distinct from the bed concentration c0 is therefore
assumed, and taken not as a constant parameter but as a variable of the problem.
Experimentally, the transition from bed to basal concentration occurs over a small
but ﬁnite vertical distance. Following Capart & Fraccarollo (2011), nevertheless, we

Note that, in general, the depth-averaged concentration c¯ does not coincide with the
ﬂux-averaged concentration cu/u¯.
The relationship between concentration, density and normal stress is illustrated in
ﬁgure 7. Assuming incompressible water and granular phases, the local mass density
of the mixture ρ is related to the local granular concentration c via
ρ = ρW + (ρS − ρW)c, (3.8)
where ρW and ρS are, respectively, the mass densities of the pure water and sediment
grains. Using the shallow ﬂow approximation, the normal stress σ at a given elevation
z is assumed to balance the weight of the overlying column of liquid and grains, i.e.
σ(z) =
∫ z˜
z
ρ(ζ )g dζ, (3.9)
where ζ is a variable of integration and g is the gravitational acceleration. In particular,
the basal normal stress is obtained from
σ =

A second integration over depth can then be performed to obtain the depth-averaged
normal stress:

As illustrated in ﬁgure 7(c,d), the normal stress exerted within the transport layer
can contribute signiﬁcantly to the total forward thrust hσ¯ that drives the wavefront.
This includes a contribution of the horizontal pressure gradient to setting bed-load
in motion (Calantoni & Puleo 2006). Using these results, a longitudinal momentum

3.3. Constitutive relations
Following Capart & Fraccarollo (2011), we consider two major ways in which the
presence of a granular phase affects the behaviour of the ﬂow. First, grains contribute
to shear and normal stresses via granular contacts. Secondly, vertical gradients of
granular concentration affect turbulence via density stratiﬁcation effects. Consider
ﬁrst granular contacts, including both short-lived immersed granular collisions and
sustained contact networks. Following Bagnold (1956), we assume for bed-load
that granular contacts support the full submerged weight of the granular phase. In
accordance with Terzaghi’s effective stress principle, the granular contribution to the
normal stress is given by
σ ′ = σ − p, (3.23)
where σ is the total normal stress introduced previously, p is the water pressure, and
σ ′ the effective stress (see ﬁgure 7c). At the base of the bed-load layer, in particular,
σ ′ = 12(c + c˜)(ρS − ρW)gδ. (3.24)
In the motionless bed, grains form a quasi-static assembly spanned by long-range
networks of sustained contacts. At the top of the bed (coinciding with the base of the
bed-load layer), the onset of shear is assumed to be controlled by the Coulomb yield
criterion (Hanes & Bowen 1985)
τ = Rσ ′ = 12(c + c˜)(ρS − ρW)Rgδ, (3.25)
where τ is the basal shear stress and R = tanϕ is the tangent of the internal angle
of friction. Equation (3.25) links the basal shear stress τ to the state of the overlying
layer, and is adopted as a ﬁrst closure relation for the model.
Although turbulence can contribute to shear stresses elsewhere in the ﬂowing layer,
we assume, following Berzi & Jenkins (2008), that turbulence intensity vanishes at
the bed. The basal shear stress exerted by bed-load grains on to the bed is therefore
assumed to be entirely due to granular collisions. Invoking kinetic theory applied
to liquid–granular ﬂows (Jenkins & Hanes 1998), the collisional normal and shear
stresses can be expressed as follows:
σ ′ = (ρS + a(c)ρW)fσ (c)T, (3.26)
τ = (ρS + a(c)ρW)fτ (c)T1/2γ˙D. (3.27)
Here, T is the granular temperature, a measure of the intensity of the granular velocity
ﬂuctuations, γ˙ = du/dz is the shear rate and D the grain diameter. Functions a(c),
fσ (c) and fτ (c) represent the inﬂuence of granular concentration c on the added mass,
normal and shear stresses, respectively. From inviscid ﬂow theory, the added mass
function is given by (Batchelor 1988)
a(c) = 1 + 2c
2(1 − c) . (3.28)
On the basis of the kinetic theory of dense granular ﬂow (Savage & Jeffrey 1981), on
the other hand, the collisional stress functions can be expressed as follows:
fσ (c) = 4c2g0, (3.29)
fτ (c) = 125√πc
2g0, (3.30)
594 B. Spinewine and H. Capart
Turning to density stratiﬁcation effects, Pugh & Wilson (1999) found in sheet-ﬂow
experiments that the gradient Richardson number
G = −g dρ/dz
ρW γ˙ 2
(3.35)
maintains an approximately constant value of G ≈ 0.035 at the top of liquid–granular
shear layers. This observation suggests that density stratiﬁcation plays a key role
in controlling momentum mixing in liquid–granular layers, as it does in other
environmental ﬂows. Earlier, Turner (1973) observed that mixing between a gravity
current and its ambient typically leads to the formation of an equilibrated outer layer,
with linear density and velocity proﬁles, characterized by a well-deﬁned gradient
Richardson number G. This represents an upside-down analogue of the present case,
where instead of entraining a mixture of grains and liquid from the underlying bed,
the gravity currents entrain ﬂuid from the overlying ambient. Turner further derived,
from the gravity current experiments of Ellison & Turner (1959), the empirical value
G = 0.058, adopted in the present work. Assuming linear proﬁles of velocity and
concentration, relation (3.35) can be applied to intense bed-load layers to obtain
G = (ρS − ρW)(c − c˜)gδ
ρWu˜2
, (3.36)
where the concentration varies between c˜ at the top and c at the base, and the velocity
from u˜ at the top to zero at the base. Equation (3.36) provides the third constitutive
relation needed to close our system of equations.
Specialized to the free-water case (δ < h, c˜ = 0), relations (3.25), (3.34) and (3.36)
coincide with relations proposed by Capart & Fraccarollo (2011) for steady uniform
intense bed-load down inclined channels. For further background and references, the
reader is referred to that paper’s auxiliary material, which is available online. Here, the
relations are extended to the surface-conﬁned case (δ = h, c˜ > 0), and applied to ﬂows
over nearly horizontal beds.
Using the three constitutive assumptions (3.25), (3.34) and (3.36), supplemented by
the complementarity relations (3.3), all seven variables z, δ, h, u˜, c, c˜ and τ can
be derived from a reduced set of three primitive variables. Although other choices
are possible, we select z, h and c as primitive variables because they are sensitive
to changes in ﬂow conditions in both the free-water and surface-conﬁned cases, and
because they lead to simpler algebraic expressions. Provided that z, h and c are given,
the other variables can be computed as follows. It is not known in advance whether
free-water or surface-conﬁned conditions hold. If a free-water layer is assumed (c˜ = 0),
the thickness of the bed-load layer is given by
δ = f D
R
√
2(s + a)
G
, (3.37)
where for brevity we use the compact notations s = ρS/ρW , f = f (c) and a = a(c). It is
correct to assume free-water conditions if δ  h. If this inequality is not met, however,
then the bed-load layer is in fact conﬁned by the ﬂow free surface. In that case, we set
δ = h, and the granular concentration at the top of the bed-load layer is given by

FIGURE 9. Local equilibrium relations compared with data from dam-break (black dots)
and stationary bed-load experiments (open symbols): (a) the observed variation of the
dimensionless transport layer thickness δ/D with the local mobility number Θ , compared
with (3.43) (solid line) and (3.44) (dashed line); (b) the observed variation of the
dimensionless granular transport rate Φ with the local mobility number Θ , compared with
(3.47) (solid line). The dam-break data were acquired at laser-instrumented cross-sections,
and the stationary data come from the intense bed-load experiments of Capart & Fraccarollo
(2011).
Based on dam-break experiments with lightweight material, Fraccarollo & Capart
(2002) obtained the calibrated relation
δ
D
= 0.18Θ. (3.44)
Instead of the linear dependence on mobility number assumed in (3.44), (3.43) predicts
a nonlinear dependence whereby the relative layer thickness grows more slowly with
Θ as Θ increases. In ﬁgure 9(a), relations (3.43) and (3.44) are compared with two
sets of measurements: the present dam-break ﬂow measurements, at laser-instrumented
cross-sections, and the measurements of Capart & Fraccarollo (2011) for stationary
inclined ﬂows. It can be seen that, without adjustment, the new relation (3.43) agrees
well with both the dam-break and stationary ﬂow measurements. Relation (3.44), by
contrast, underestimates the thickness of the transport layer for low Θ values. For
low values of the mobility number, bed-load layers are thicker but more dilute than
assumed in earlier work. Both sets of experiments cover approximately the same range
of mobility numbers, from Θ = 0 to Θ = 100. For this range, the maximum Shields
number is approximately 3, and the ratio of fall velocity to shear velocity does not
drop below 0.8 (see Capart & Fraccarollo 2011).
For the free-water case, another consequence of the assumed constitutive relations is
a simple equation for the bed-load transport rate. When c˜ = 0, (3.20) for the granular
ﬂux j becomes
j = 16cδu˜, (3.45)
which is a direct consequence of the shapes assumed for the granular concentration
and velocity proﬁles. Following Einstein (1950), the granular ﬂux j (the volumetric

plotted against the Froude number Fr = u˜/√gh. For a given type of granular material,
the dimensionless numbers h/D and Fr sufﬁce to characterize the local ﬂow, save for
the extra degree of freedom associated with the bed elevation above an arbitrary datum.

where h0 is the liquid depth that would result from the settling of all sediment
in the column. The strategy we adopt is to express all variables in terms of basal
concentration c, then set up a root-ﬁnding step. Assuming that a free-water layer is

h = h0 + 12δc/c0, (3.64)
z = z˜ − h, (3.65)
and we can determine if the correct case was chosen by checking that h  δ. If this
condition is not met, then the bed-load layer is conﬁned by the free surface. In that
case, δ = h, and thus
h = h0 c0c0 − c¯ , (3.66)
where c¯ = (c + c˜)/2. On the other hand,
h = f D

Combining the two equations to eliminate h, we obtain a cubic equation in c¯,
c¯3 − (c + 2c0)c¯2 + (k + 2c0c + c20)c¯ − c20c = 0, (3.68)
where k = GR2h20c20/(2f 2D2(s + a)), from which root c¯ can be determined. We can then
calculate h from (3.67), and z = z˜ − h. In both the free and conﬁned cases, we can
obtain velocity u˜ from (3.39), and the remaining condition to be satisﬁed is
ρW(h − 12δ)u˜ + (ρS − ρW)δu˜( 16c + 13 c˜) = μ. (3.69)
For known balance variables z˜ and z0c0, it is thus possible to express the momentum
density μ in terms of only one unknown, the basal concentration c. The resulting
curve is well-behaved, passing through the origin and increasing monotonously as the
basal concentration rises. The curve also passes continuously through the transition
between unconﬁned and conﬁned sheet ﬂow. As a result, the basal concentration c
can be determined from a known momentum density μ using a numerical root-ﬁnding
step. The other primitive variables can then be calculated and the numerical scheme is
complete.
4. Results and comparison
The shallow ﬂow theory outlined in § 3 can now be applied to the conditions of the
laboratory experiments of § 2. For convenience, we summarize in table 1 the physical
constants, material properties and numerical parameters used in the calculations. Note
that there remain no free parameters to be calibrated from the experiments. All values
are known from generic physical observations (gradient Richardson number), material
characterization tests or good computational practice. In most of this section, we will
focus on the ﬂat-bed conﬁguration described in § 3. For this reference case, dam-break
waves are released over an initially horizontal bed of water-saturated PVC granules,
and the initial water depth is h = H0 = 0.35 m upstream of the dam. This is the case
represented by the experimental photo-mosaics of ﬁgure 2. It is also the case for
which experimental measurements are most complete, having been collected from a

wave, approximately ﬂat states are observed for all three interfaces. Downstream, a
positive wave overruns the initially ﬂat bed, with a rapidly varied erosional bore at the
wavefront. From upstream to downstream, the total ﬂow depth decreases approximately
monotonously. The thickness of the bed-load layer, by contrast, continuously increases
until it invades the entire ﬂow depth at the front.
Figure 11(b) shows the calculated longitudinal variation of the surface velocity
u˜(x, t) at the same times t1, t2, t3. Except for short segments of mildly decreasing
velocity at the centre and near the front of the wave, the longitudinal velocity increases
monotonously from upstream to downstream. The fastest surface velocity is observed
at the transition between conﬁned and unconﬁned bed-load, near the front of the
dam-break wave. Finally, ﬁgure 11(c) shows proﬁles of concentrations c(x, t) (thin
line) and c˜(x, t) (thick line), at the base and top of the transport layer, respectively.
The basal concentration c(x, t) increases from zero upstream, up to a maximum at
the downstream wavefront. Close to the wavefront, the modelled concentration values
slightly exceed the bed concentration, an artefact indicating that the theory reaches
the limits of its validity in that region. The concentration c˜(x, t) at the top of the

predicted interfaces z (short dashes), z + δ (long dashes) and z˜ = z + h (solid lines).
As assumed in the theory and observed earlier by Spinewine & Zech (2007),
measured velocity proﬁles away from the wavefront are well-approximated by
piecewise linear proﬁles featuring vertical segments of constant velocity in the free-
water layer, inclined segments of rapid shear in the bed-load layer and zero velocity
in the bed. Furthermore, the predicted locations of the proﬁle breaks (coinciding in
the theory with interfaces z and z + δ) match very well those observed in the data.
As in the steady uniform ﬂow experiments of Capart & Fraccarollo (2011), however,
proﬁle breaks in the measured data are more gradual than the sharp angles assumed
in the theory. Agreement becomes less good near the front of the wave, where the
bed-load layer invades the whole ﬂow depth and becomes conﬁned by the ﬂow free
surface. There, the linear velocity proﬁles assumed in the theory differ more markedly
from the more rounded S shape of the measured proﬁles. In the measurements near
the front, high rates of shear are localized in a narrow horizontal band around
elevation z = 0, whereas the regions of constant shear rate of the calculated linear
proﬁles extend further up and down. At the wavefront, the observed base of the
transport layer does not reach as deep into the bed as predicted by the theory. These
discrepancies may be due to various factors. First, velocities in the bed-load layer may
no longer be well-represented by linear proﬁles when the bed-load layer thickens and
becomes conﬁned by the free surface. Secondly, the assumed constitutive relations for
stratiﬁed, collisional liquid–granular ﬂow may no longer be appropriate when granular
concentrations become high, and the ﬂow there may transition to a different, dense
granular ﬂow rheology (Jop, Forterre & Pouliquen 2006). It is also possible that non-
equilibrium pore pressure effects play a role. Near the front, pore water must percolate
down through a thick granular layer to compensate for dilatation of the granular phase

local bed elevations, and variations in velocity gradients. These differences may be
attributed partly to slight differences in experimental conditions (e.g. how the granular
bed was levelled before each run). Most probably, however, they can be ascribed to the
instability-generated, large-scale coherent vortices produced by the shear ﬂow, which
vary in phase and degree of development from run to run. In light of this variability in
the measurements, reasonable agreement is observed between calculated and measured
proﬁles, even in this close-up view. As observed earlier in ﬁgure 13, agreement is
good away from the wavefront (except for an anomalous cross-section at x = 0.25 m),
but poorer near the wavefront (ﬁgure 14a, cross-sections xj = 0.875, 1 and 1.125 m),
since the measured velocities there differ from the assumed linear proﬁle. Fortunately,
such errors in the detailed shape of the velocity proﬁle do not prevent the calculated
solution from reproducing the correct height and celerity of the front, presumably
because depth averages remain accurate in the aggregate.
Proﬁles of granular concentration acquired using the laser-based technique are
presented in ﬁgure 15, at the same times and cross-sections. The ﬁgure uses the same
plot conventions as before, although the proﬁles are now anchored at the top instead
of the bottom, since that is where zero concentrations are attained. Like the velocity
proﬁles, repeat measurements of the granular concentration proﬁles exhibit vertical
shifts. Concentration gradients, however, are more consistent from run to run than the
velocity gradients of ﬁgure 14. On the downside, the concentration data points for each
proﬁle exhibit a greater degree of scatter, especially near the bed, where the statistics
become poor. In spite of these limitations, a clear and consistent picture emerges from
the data. As observed earlier by Capart & Fraccarollo (2011) for steady uniform ﬂows,

each other when taking the product, good overall agreement is obtained between the
calculated and measured cu proﬁles.
4.3. Comparison with interface data for multiple test conditions
Having made detailed comparisons for one reference case, we now test the theory in a
wider range of experimental conditions. The conditions selected, from the experiments
of Spinewine & Zech (2007), include tests with PVC grains in a variety of geometrical
conﬁgurations, as well as experiments with sand grains (for the corresponding material
properties, see table 1). All tests start with layers of water and water-saturated grains
at rest on both sides of the thin vertical gate, positioned at x = 0. The initial conditions
at t = 0 are speciﬁed by

The bed and free surface are initially horizontal on both sides of the gate, but levels
z L, z R, z˜L and z˜R on the left and right sides differ from test to test, as listed in table 2.
In ﬁgure 17, the calculated interface proﬁles for the different conditions (solid lines)
are compared with the experimental data (dots). As before, calculations are performed
without any parameter adjustment. For all experiments, longitudinal proﬁles of the bed
z (short dashes), the top of the bed-load layer z + δ (long dashes) and the ﬂow free
surface z˜ = z + h (solid line) were acquired by visual inspection from calibrated image
frames, as explained in § 2. These data were made available earlier in an electronic
supplement to the paper by Spinewine & Zech (2007). Although measured proﬁles at
multiple times are available, we have selected for comparison those acquired at time
t = 1.25 s.
The results for the reference case (ﬂat bed, PVC grains and upstream ﬂow depth
H0 = 0.35 m) are shown in ﬁgure 17(a). For this case, which was examined earlier in
great detail, excellent agreement is obtained between the calculated and measured
interface proﬁles. The eroded bed level (short dashes), the top of the bed-load
layer (long dashes) and the ﬂow free surface (solid line) are all well-predicted
by the theory. Only at the wavefront does the agreement become less satisfactory.
Immediately upstream of the steep propagating front, the calculations place the bed
level too low and the ﬂow free surface too high, over-predicting the ﬂow thickness.
The likely reason, noted earlier, is that the actual velocities in that region are poorly
approximated by the assumed linear proﬁle.
Cases otherwise identical to the reference case, but with step-like discontinuities
in the initial bed level on both sides of the gate, are presented in ﬁgure 17(b–d).
Figure 15(b) features a 5 cm rise in bed level, while ﬁgure 17(c,d) feature bed level
drops of 5 and 10 cm, respectively. For all three cases, local differences between
the predicted and measured interfaces are observed where the bed proﬁle varies most
rapidly. This occurs at downstream location x ≈ 0.5 m for the upward step case
(ﬁgure 17b), and upstream location x ≈ −0.25 m for the two downward step cases
(ﬁgure 17c,d). The measured free-surface curvatures tend to be stronger than predicted
across an upward step (ﬁgure 17b), but milder across a downward step (ﬁgure 17c,d).

TABLE 2. The experimental conditions for the different test cases of Spinewine & Zech
(2007) examined in ﬁgure 17.
agreement is also registered near the wavefront. Nevertheless, these local discrepancies
do not compromise the global behaviour of the calculated solutions, and good overall
agreement is maintained between the calculated and measured proﬁles.
As a further variation in initial conditions, ﬁgure 17(e) presents a test case identical
to case (d) (ﬁgure 17d), but with the downstream bed initially covered by a
layer of water that is 10 cm deep. In this case, the longitudinal wave structure is
qualitatively different from that exhibited in cases (a–d). Whereas cases (a–d) feature
two rarefactions and a shock (Fraccarollo & Capart 2002), the upstream to downstream
sequence in case (e) features a rarefaction and two shocks. Instead of a gradually
thinning ﬂow proﬁle, a rapidly varied hydraulic jump followed by a long constant state
and a propagating bore is observed downstream of the gate (Spinewine & Zech 2007).
As shown in ﬁgure 17(e), this major change in wave response resulting from a minor
change to the initial conditions is well-reproduced by the calculated solutions. In both
the experiments and the calculations, signiﬁcant bed-load transport is restricted to a
shallow throat-like region of the ﬂow, observed around the initial position of the gate
(near x = 0).
Figure 17(f ) presents results for conditions identical to case (a) (ﬁgure 17a), save
for a reduction of the initial upstream water depth from H0 = 0.35 m to H0 = 0.25 m.
This represents a scaled-down version of the ﬂow, with a corresponding decrease in
depth relative to grain diameter D (kept constant since the same PVC material is
used). For this case, the same level of agreement is obtained as for the reference
case (ﬁgure 17a), indicating that the theory and constitutive relations respond well to
changes in initial depth H0 and depth-to-diameter ratio H0/D.
Finally, tests conducted with natural sand instead of PVC are presented in
ﬁgure 17(g). The corresponding grains are smaller (D = 1.8 mm instead of 3.9 mm)
and heavier s = ρS/ρW = 2.68 instead of 1.58) than the PVC granules (see table 1).
Because heavier grains have reduced mobility, the bed-load layer for sand grains
is signiﬁcantly thinner than for PVC. Consequently, the gradually thinning ﬂow
downstream of the gate is able to extend further downstream, with a corresponding
decrease in ﬂow depth at the wavefront. At the wavefront, a further qualitative
difference is observed when the material is changed from PVC (ﬁgure 17a) to sand
(ﬁgure 17g). Whereas the bed-load layer at the front invades the whole ﬂow depth in
the case of PVC, for sand the bed-load layer remains thinner than the ﬂow thickness
even very near the front. These features of the observed wave are captured well by the
predicted proﬁles. Nevertheless, the calculations for sand tend to slightly overestimate
the bed-load layer thickness, and to slightly underestimate the propagation speed of the
wavefront.

Secondly, it is found that the constitutive relations governing the equilibrated ﬂow
state match those governing intense bed-load in steady uniform ﬂow down inclined
beds. The physical assumptions found to carry over from steady uniform to unsteady
varied ﬂows include: Coulomb yield at the bed, equilibration of shear rate and density
stratiﬁcation within the bed-load layer, and collisional stresses at the base of the
bed-load layer. One difference is that, for unsteady varied ﬂow, one can no longer
assume that the bed shear stress equilibrates the inclined weight of the overlying ﬂow
layer. Conversely, the velocity proﬁle in the water layer is not expected to remain
ﬂat for steady uniform of gradually varied ﬂows down long inclined beds. Finally,
the results obtained highlight the importance of detailed experimental measurements
for the pursuit of modelling efforts. Newly available measurements were crucial in
this case to make progress with respect to earlier work. These measurements were
exploited to inform our choice of constitutive and proﬁle assumptions, and then to
check the calculated proﬁles in detail.
Further work is needed to address the limitations of the present theory and
assumptions, and to apply newly available measurement tools to a wider range of
experimental conditions. Signiﬁcant efforts will be required to extend the proposed
theory to more realistic conditions, including multidirectional ﬂows and surges over
long inclined beds. Finally, phenomena outside the scope of the present approach
include bed-load transport near the threshold of motion, the transition to debris
ﬂows, and the transport of ﬁne sediment instead of coarse grains. For of all these
phenomena, going beyond the presently available level of detail is likely to require
new experimental information as well as novel modelling ideas.
