(一) 中文摘要 
在評估一個連結網路(interconnection network)的效能中，有一個重要的議題是圖
形嵌入(graph embedding)。尤其，迴圈嵌入(或路徑嵌入)的問題，就是討論原圖是否
含有子圖為特定長度的迴圈(或路徑)。一個連結網路通常以無向簡單圖形(undirected 
simple graph) G=(V,E)表示，其中點集合 V(G) 代表處理單元(processing element)而邊
集合 E(G)代表通訊管道(communication channel)。一條連接 u 和 v 兩點的路徑之中最
短的，我們稱之為 u-v 最短路徑(u-v geodesic)。在一圖形 G 中 uv 兩點之間的最短距
離代表 u-v 最短路徑上的邊個數，表示成 dG(u,v)。一圖形 G 若有一迴圈包含所有點
則為漢米爾頓圖。邊泛圈性與泛連通性都是漢米爾頓性質的延伸。一個有 n 個點的
圖形 G，假如每一個邊都落在一個長度從 3 到 n 的迴圈之中，則 G 被稱為邊泛圈
(edge-pancyclic)圖。在一個圖形 G 中，假如對任兩點而言，都有長度從 dG(u,v)到 n−1
的路徑連接這兩點，則 G 被稱為泛連通(panconnected)圖。明顯地，所有泛連通圖都
是邊泛圈圖。源自邊泛圈圖的特性，我們提出最短路徑泛圈圖。 
在一個有 n 個點的圖形 G 中，對任兩點 u 和 v 而言，假如每一條 u-v 最短路徑
都落在長度從 max{2dG(u,v),3}到 n 之間的迴圈上，則稱 G 為最短路徑泛圈
(geodesic-pancyclic)圖。因為雙分圖(bipartite graph)沒有長度為奇數的迴圈，所以我
們提出最短路徑泛偶圈(geodesic-bipancyclicity)的性質。在一個有 n 個點的雙分圖 G
中，對任兩點 u和 v而言，假如每一條 u-v最短路徑都落在偶數長度從max{2dG(u,v),4}
到 n 之間的迴圈上，則稱 G 為最短路徑泛偶圈圖。 
超立方體是一種最普遍、多用途且有效率的連結網路的拓樸結構。許多學者已
經投入在超立方體與其他類似超立方體網路的漢米爾頓性質研究。我們觀察一個具
有最短路徑泛圈性質的連結網路會擁有迴圈嵌入與容錯路徑嵌入的優點。在本計畫
中，我們將研究超立方體與其他類似超立方體網路的最短路徑泛圈性。此外，我們
探討一些類似超立方體網路的容錯泛連通性與容錯最短路徑泛圈性。

Choudum and Sunitha [S.A. Choudum, V. Sunitha, Augmented cubes, Networks 40 (2002)
71–84] proposed the class of augmented cubes as a variation of hypercubes and showed
that augmented cubes possess several embedding properties that the hypercubes and
other variations do not possess. Recently, Hsu et al. [H.-C. Hsu, P.-L. Lai, C.-H. Tsai, Geode-
sic-pancyclicity and balanced pancyclicity of augmented cubes, Information Processing
Letters 101 (2007) 227–232] showed that the n-dimensional augmented cube AQn,
nP 2, is weakly geodesic-pancyclic, i.e., for each pair of vertices u;v 2 AQn and for each
integer ‘ satisfying maxf2dðu;vÞ;3g 6 ‘ 6 2n where d(u,v) denotes the distance between
u and v in AQn, there is a cycle of length ‘ that contains a u-v geodesic. In this paper, we
obtain a stronger result by proving that AQn , nP 2, is indeed geodesic-pancyclic, i.e., for
each pair of vertices u;v 2 AQn and for each integer ‘ satisfying maxf2dðu;vÞ;3g
6 ‘ 6 2n, every u-v geodesic lies on a cycle of length ‘. To achieve the result, we ﬁrst show
that AQn  f , nP 3, remains panconnected (and thus is also edge-pancyclic) if f 2 AQn is
any faulty vertex. The result of fault-tolerant panconnectivity is the best possible in the
sense that the number of faulty vertices in AQn , nP 3, cannot be increased.

1. Introduction
An interconnection network is usually modeled as an undirected simple graph G = (V,E), where the vertex set V = V(G)
denotes the set of processing elements and the edge set E = E(G) denotes the set of communication channels, respec-
tively. For interconnection networks, nicely topological properties enable them to support efﬁcient and robust commu-
nication algorithms. Especially, properties related to cycle embedding have attracted a burst of studies in the literature
(see, for example, [1,7–9,12,19]) because networks with cycle topology are suitable for designing simple algorithms with
low communication costs. Moreover, cycle embeddings are also concerned extensively in many diverse interconnection
networks with faulty elements [4,13–17,20,21]. For more information about the interconnection networks, the reader
can refer to [10,18].
Let G be a graph and u; v 2 VðGÞ be any two vertices. A path (respectively, shortest path) connecting u and v is called
a u-v path (respectively, u-v geodesic). The distance between u and v, denoted by dGðu;vÞ, is the number of edges in a u-v
geodesic. A path (respectively, cycle) that contains every vertex of a graph exactly once is called a hamiltonian path

Accordingly, we use u½qiv (also, v ¼ u½qi  or u ¼ v ½qi ) to mean that both u and v are connected by a hypercube edge with
the complement only at the i-th bit for 2 6 i 6 n. By contrast, we use u½civ (also, v ¼ u½ci  or u ¼ v ½ci ) to mean that both u and
v are connected by a complement edge with the complement at all the ﬁrst i bits for 1 6 i 6 n.
For example, the graphs shown in Fig. 2 are augmented cubes AQ1, AQ2 and AQ3, respectively. It was proved in [6] that
AQn is vertex transitive, (2n-1)-regular, and has diameter dn=2e. Let Ln ¼ f½q2; ½q3; . . . ; ½qn; ½c1; ½c2; . . . ; ½cng denote the set
consisting of 2n-1 links outgoing from a vertex in AQn. The elements of Ln can be used to represent a path in AQn explicitly.
For instance, we write 000½q2½c3½c2110 to denote the path 000 ! 010 ! 101 ! 110 in AQ3.
For convenience, if no ambiguity arises, we write u 2 AQn instead of u 2 VðAQnÞ when u is a vertex of AQn. In the follow-
ing, several properties of AQn are provided without giving the proof because they can be easily derived from the deﬁnition.
Proposition 1. If two vertices u;v 2 AQn are joined by a hypercube edge u½qiv for 2 6 i 6 n, then u and v are also connected by
two paths u½ci½ci1v and u½ci1½civ of length 2. Similarly, if u and v are joined by a complement edge u½civ for 2 6 i 6 n
(respectively, for 1 6 i 6 n 1), then u and v are also connected by two paths u½ci1½qiv , and u½qi½ci1v (respectively,
u½ciþ1½qiþ1v and u½qiþ1½ciþ1v) of length 2.
From above, we can see that for each vertex u 2 AQn and 2 6 i 6 n (respectively, 1 6 i 6 n 1), the four vertices u, u½ci ,
u½qi , and u½ci1  (respectively, u, u½ci , u½ciþ1 , and u½qiþ1 ) form a complete subgraph K4 in AQn (see Fig. 3). Thus, every edge of
AQn is contained in both of a 3-cycle and a 4-cycle for nP 2.
Proposition 2 shows that more than one 4-cycle can pass through an edge of AQn for nP 2. Proposition 5 reveals the com-
mutativity of Ln on a u-v geodesic.
Proposition 2. For ½x; ½y 2 Ln with ½x–½y, if two vertices u;v 2 AQn are joined by an edge u½xv , then u and v are also connected
by the path u½y½x½yv of length 3.
Proposition 3. For 2 6 i 6 n, if P is a geodesic in AQn, then P cannot contain the following pairs of links: f½qi; ½cig, f½qi; ½ci1g and
f½ci; ½ci1g.
Proposition 4. For ½x 2 Ln, if P is a geodesic in AQn, then [x] appears in P at most once.
Proposition 5. For u;v 2 AQn and ½x; ½y 2 Ln, if u    ½x½y   v is a u-v geodesic in AQn, then so is u    ½y½x   v .
Proposition 6 is a consequence of Proposition 4. Also, by repeatedly applying Proposition 5 on a u-v geodesic, we can ob-
tain Proposition 7.
Proposition 6. For u;v 2 AQkn1 where k 2 f0;1g, if P is a u-v geodesic in AQn, then every vertex of P must be contained in the
same AQkn1.

The result of Theorem 2 is the best possible because augmented cubes cannot preserve the panconnectivity if one more
faulty vertex is included. For instance, consider a K4 structure with vertices x, y ¼ x½c1 , z ¼ x½c2 , and w ¼ x½q2  in AQn. Since
NðxÞ \ NðyÞ ¼ fz;wg, if both z and w fault in AQn, then no path of length 2 joins x and y.
4. Geodesic-pancyclicity
The following is the main theorem of this paper.
Theorem 3. The augmented cube AQn, nP 2, is geodesic-pancyclic.
Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on n. Since AQ2 is a complete graph, the theorem holds when n = 2. Suppose that
nP 3 and the theorem is true for all augmented cubes of dimension less than n. Let u;v 2 AQn be any two vertices and
d ¼ dAQn ðu;vÞ. We will show that hu;vi is geodesic-pancyclic in AQn. Since AQn is panconnected, if d = 1 then there exists
a u-v path of length ‘ for each ‘ with 2 6 ‘ 6 2n  1 in AQn. This shows that hu;vi is geodesic-pancyclic for d = 1. We now
consider dP 2. Let P be any u-v geodesic in AQn and H ¼ AQn  ðP  fu;vgÞ. Then, we will show the existence of u-v paths
of length from d to 2n  d in H. By symmetry, we may consider the following two cases.
Case 1. u; v 2 AQ0n1. By Proposition 6, every vertex of P is contained in AQ0n1. From the induction hypothesis, there exists
a u-v path, say Q(u,v), of length ‘ for each ‘ with d 6 ‘ 6 2n1  d in AQ0n1  ðP  fu;vgÞ. By Proposition 1 and the K4
structure, there exist two adjacent vertices x; y 2 Qðu;vÞ and two vertices x0 ¼ x½a and y0 ¼ y½a in AQ1n1 for ½a 2 f½qn; ½cng
such that xx0y0y forms a path of length 3. Thus, if Q(u,v) is a path of length 2n1  d 1 (respectively, 2n1  d), then removing
the edge xy from Q(u,v) and adding the path xx0y0y result in a u-v path of length 2n1  dþ 1 (respectively, 2n1  dþ 2) in H.
Let bQ ðu;vÞ be such a path of length 2n1  dþ 2. Since AQ1n1 is panconnected and x0; y0 2 AQ1n1 are two adjacent vertices,
there exists an x0-y0 path, say Qðx0; y0Þ, of length h for each hwith 1 6 h 6 2n1  1 in AQ1n1. Therefore, combining bQ ðu;vÞ and
Qðx0; y0Þ and removing edge x0y0, we obtain a u-v path of length ‘ ¼ ð2n1  dþ 2Þ þ h 1 for each ‘ with
2n1  dþ 2 6 ‘ 6 2n  d in H.
Case 2. u 2 AQ0n1 and v 2 AQ1n1. By Propositions 3 and 4, either ½qn or ½cn appears in P exactly once. Let x 2 AQ0n1 and
y 2 AQ1n1 be such two adjacent vertices in P. Let d1 ¼ dAQ0n1 ðu; xÞ ¼ dAQn ðu; xÞ and d2 ¼ dAQn ðy;vÞ ¼ dAQ1n1 ðy;vÞ. Without loss
of generality, we assume d1 6 d2. Since dP 2, we consider the following cases.
Case 2.1. d1 ¼ 0 (i.e., u = x) and d2 ¼ 1. In this case, d = 2 and H ¼ AQn  y. By Theorem 2, there exists a u-v path of length ‘
for each ‘ with 2 6 ‘ 6 2n  2 in H.
Case 2.2. d1 ¼ 0 (i.e., u = x) and d2 P 2. In this case, d ¼ d1 þ d2 þ 1P 3. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a y-v
path, say Q(y,v), of length k for each kwith d2 6 k 6 2n1  d2 in AQ1n1  ðP  fu; y;vgÞ. Let y0 2 Qðy;vÞ be the vertex adjacent
to y. Then, for each y-v path Q(y,v), there is a corresponding y0-v path, say Qðy0;vÞ, of length k0 ¼ k 1 for each k0 with
d2  1 6 k0 6 2n1  d in AQ1n1  ðP  fu;vgÞ. Clearly, u ¼ y½a for ½a 2 f½qn; ½cng and y0 ¼ y½b for ½b 2 Ln1. By Proposition 2,
there is a vertex u0 ¼ u½b ¼ y0½a such that uu0y0y ¼ u½b½a½by forms a path of length 3. Clearly, u0 2 AQ0n1. Since AQ0n1 is
