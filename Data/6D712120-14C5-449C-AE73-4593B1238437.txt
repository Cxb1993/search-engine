中文摘要：
填角銲(fillet weld)經常用在金屬結構中以連結各種形式的構件，當這些銲接接頭受到疲勞載重
或超載時，填角銲接頭常在填角銲的趾部或根部產生裂縫，甚至斷裂；因此，如何正確地評估這些
銲接接頭處的應力集中係數(stress intensity factor)也就變得至為重要，而這些應力集中係數
的正確與否，也就直接影響到接頭構件後續的疲勞與斷裂評估之準確與否；通常，對於複雜構件的
應力集中係數常藉由數值方法(如：有限元素法或邊界元素法)來求得，然而，這些數值方法的計算
常是基於許多理想的假設，如：理想的材料性質、理想的幾何形狀、理想的應力與邊界條件…等等，
因此，藉由這些數值方法計算而來的結果，也許並不能真正反映出這些複雜構件在現地(in-situ)
的應力集中係數值；本研究利用 CCD 相機成功量測一些複雜構件如：十字銲接接頭和搭接接頭的應
力集中係數，本研究亦證明此種利用 CCD 相機的實驗方法，可被應用來量測任何具有表面裂縫的銲
接接頭(假設接頭分別能滿足 Irwin 的位移場解)，更重要的是，此種 CCD 相機實驗簡單不複雜且實
驗器材攜帶方便，這些優點將使得在現地量測銲接構件的應力集中係數變為可能，吾人將可以直接
在現地直接量測構件的真實應力集中係數，這對許多重要的結構如鋼橋、鑽油平台的疲勞評估有重

The objective of this two-year research project is to determine/measure the stress intensity factors of
the common fillet and butt welded joints in metallic structures by a least-squares procedure combined
with a proposed CCD camera experiment method. In the first year, the project applicant is studying the
mixed-mode behavior of stress intensity factors (KI and KII) for the fillet welded cruciform joints and lap
joints numerically and experimentally. In this second year continuing research proposal, the applicant
hopes to investigate the mixed-mode stress intensity factors (KI and KII) for the notch problems in the
butt-welded notched joints using the CCD camera experiment combined with the more advanced image
correlation method and the least-squares procedure. The progress report of the first year NSC project is
described as follows:
I. SIF Calculation Using Least-Squares Method
Fig. 1 Sharp Crack in an Infinite Plate
Least-squares method has been successfully employed in finite element methods as a useful means
for computing stress intensity factors of sharp cracks in isotropic standard specimens (Ju (1996) and Ju et
al. (1997)). A least-squares method combining the measurement of the displacement field near a crack
tip with a CCD camera was applied in this study to calculate the stress intensity factors for fillet welded
cruciform joints and lap joints. The main idea of this method is to obtain the stress intensity factors of
the cracked detail by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals that are the differences between the
theoretical point displacements and the measured point displacements by the CCD camera.
For a linear-elastic and isotropic plate with a sharp crack (see Fig. 1), the in-plane displacement
fields near the crack tip can be shown in the form of a series expansion (Irwin, 1957) as follows:

r andare located on the non-negative-y-coordinate region.
In the experiment of this study, y in Fig. 1 (i.e. the shortest distance from the center of a square
symbol to the crack surface) is controlled to be very small, so values for the top and bottom square
symbols in Eq. (9) and (10) are very close to . As a result, the even terms for Un and Vn are
approximately zero. In order to reduce the errors in the proposed least squares method, one can
disregard the even terms in Eq. (7) and (8) as follows:

Suppose the CODs of m pairs of top and bottom square symbols near the crack tip are considered.
The sum of error squares of these CODs resulted from experimental measurement or numerical
simulation can be expressed as follows:

from experimental measurement or numerical simulation for the ith pair of square symbols; [U]i and [V]i
are [U] and [V] matrixes in Eq. (7) and (8) for the ith pair of square symbols.
To perform least squares method, the sum of error squares  can be minimized by letting

II. Fabrication of the Fillet Welded Cruciform and Lap Joint Specimen
Fillet Welded Cruciform Joint Specimens:
The cruciform joint specimens (see Fig. 2) tested in this study were made of three A36 steel
rectangular plates (width = 15mm and thickness = 15mm) and were fillet welded at the four corners using
manual tungsten inert gas (TIG) arc welding by the ER70S-G filler metal which conforms to AWS A5.18
specifications. A total of fifteen fillet welded cruciform joint specimens were fabricated by the
combination of five fillet weld leg sizes (w = 3mm, 7.5mm, 9mm, 12mm and 15mm) and three types of
edge preparations, which could result in three center crack sizes (2a = 15mm, 12mm and 9mm) in the
un-penetrated region due to lack of penetration after TIG welding. The fifteen specimens were then
classified into three groups (A, B and C) by the three center crack sizes in the un-penetrated region of the
specimens, and each group had five specimens of different fillet weld leg sizes. In order to ensure the
specified uniform center crack size through the thickness in the cruciform joint specimen, the two center
cracks in the un-penetrated regions of the cruciform joint were re-cut by the wire electrical discharge
machining (EDM) process to remove any irregular weld penetration occurred at the weld roots through
the thickness. Table 1 shows the fillet welded portions of the fifteen cruciform joint specimens after
fabrication and wire EDM process, and Table 2 lists the design and measured dimensions of the fifteen
specimens.

To measure the CODs near the crack tip (weld root), a piece of paper with two parallel rows of tiny
black square symbols printed on it was attached on the specimen. The size of a square symbol was
around 0.16 mm, and the center-to-center length of the black square symbols was 0.25 mm. Fig. 4
shows the A15 and DA3 specimens prepared for the experiment.
position change of each symbol can be seen clearly in Fig. 5(c). For each specified tensile load, the
measured CODs near the crack tip can be substituted into the proposed least squares method as described
in Eq. (13)-(15) to derive the stress intensity factor of the cruciform or lap joint specimens.

Abstract
A least-squares procedure to determine the stress intensity factors (SIFs) of fillet-welded lap joints
numerically and experimentally is demonstrated in this paper. The crack opening displacements (CODs)
near the weld root region of fillet welded lap joint details can be numerically computed from ordinary finite
element scheme or be experimentally measured by a commercial digital camera. The obtained CODs are
then employed in the suggested least-squares procedure for the following SIF evaluation. For numerical
analysis, the finite element analysis combined with the least-squares procedure was employed to compute
the shear mode (mode II) stress intensity factors (KII) of the fillet welded single lap joints. A non-contact
COD measurement system using a commercial digital camera and the least-squares procedure was utilized
to determine the shear mode stress intensity factors of the fabricated lap joint specimens as well. The test
results from experiments were in good agreement with the results from numerical analysis. In summary,
the suggested least-squares procedure can be numerically or experimentally applied to any detail with a
surface crack where the Irwin’s series solution for crack-tip displacement fields is valid. Moreover, the
portability of the demonstrated experimental method makes it possible for field measurement of SIFs
directly from the details of interest at the site.
Introduction
Fillet weld roots and weld toes usually result in high stress concentration and initiate
cracks in steel structures. Hence, evaluating the stress intensity factors (SIFs) of the fillet
weld roots and toes accurately is very important. Numerical evaluations of the SIFs at
the fillet weld roots and weld toes of many details in steel structures have been studied by
many scholars such as Frank (1971), Maddox (1975), Hobbacher (1993), Bowness and
Lee (1996) and Lie and Bian (1997)…etc. The fillet welded lap joint details are
frequently applied in steel structures for connecting plates. The lap portion of the two
connecting plates forms an inherent crack and the crack size is almost the same as the lap
length. When the lapped plates are subjected to tension, the fillet welds in the lap joint
detail are subjected to shear and the weld root will result in shear mode (mode II) stress
intensity factor. In fact, the weld root in the lap joint has mixed-mode (mode I and mode
II) stress intensity factors, but the mode I stress intensity factor is always negative
(Murakami (1987)). Murakami (1980) employed the body force method to study the
mixed-mode stress intensity factors of the lap joint details as shown in Figure 1 with the
limitation of L/H=4, and the mode I and mode II stress intensity factors (KI and KII) were
normalized as follows:

r and are located on the non-negative-y-coordinate region. u and v are the crack

polar coordinates; =shear modulus; =for plane stress and =for
plane strain;= Poisson’s ratio. Inc and IInc are coefficients to be determined. It is noted
that the first terms of Inc and
II
nc are related to the mode I and mode II stress intensity
factors respectively (i.e. 2II1 Kc  and 2IIII1 Kc  ). Once the coefficients, Inc
and IInc , are determined, the mixed-mode stress intensity factors of a crack tip can be
obtained. In numerical analysis, the CODs near the crack tip were obtained by the
relative displacements of pairs of node points on the top and bottom crack surfaces
computed from the finite element analysis. In the experiment, two rows of evenly spaced
square symbols printed on the paper are glued on the specimen with the crack in the
middle as shown in Figure 2. The CODs of the crack are measured by the relative
displacements between the top and bottom rows of square symbols. Suppose the CODs
of m pairs of top and bottom square symbols near the crack tip are considered. The sum
of error squares of these CODs resulted from the numerical simulation or the
experimental measurement can be expressed as follows:

Table 1. Comparison of MkII Factor for the Three Specimens
From Table 1, it can be seen that the numerical and experimental MKII results of the three
lap joint specimens agree well with the numerical results obtained by Murakami (1987).
The influences of the crack size due to the lap length (2a) on the lap joint details can be
observed and verified in the three specimens tested in this study. The longer the lap
length (2a), the greater the value of MKII. The increment of lap length can essentially
increase the stress intensity factor of the weld root in a fillet welded lap joint detail under
the boundary and load conditions shown in Figure 1.
Conclusion
This paper demonstrates the numerical and experimental applications of using the least-
squares method to evaluate the SIFs of fillet welded lap joints. Three lap joint specimens
of different lap lengths were carefully tested and analyzed. The numerical and
experimental shear mode SIF results of the three lap joint specimens agree well with the
corresponding SIF values analyzed by Murakami (1987). The least-squares procedure for
determining SIFs can be applied on any homogenous and isotropic detail/member with a
surface crack where the Irwin’s equation (1957) can be employed. The simplicity of the
digital camera experiment and the portability of the experimental instrumentation make
the field measurement of SIF possible and provide a good means to acquire SIFs directly
from details at the site, which is very useful for fatigue evaluation of details in structures
like steel bridges and offshore structures.
