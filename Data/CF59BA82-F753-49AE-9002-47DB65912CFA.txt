Abstract 
Base isolation has been popularly implemented in civil engineering. However, 
conventional isolation system possessing linear restoring force may be invalid under a 
near-fault earthquake which possesses low-frequency content and may induce 
resonance. Therefore, the eccentric rolling isolation system (ERIS) possessing 
nonlinear restoring is proposed. The base, which can be mounted on a structure or 
equipment, is eccentrically pinned on a circular isolator; and friction damping, which 
can be tuned by bolts, is considered.  
In passive case, the ERIS performs as good as conventional linear isolation 
system under far-field earthquake. Subjected to near-fault earthquake, the ERIS shows 
better reduction in acceleration than the corresponding linear one. The ERIS also 
reduced the amplification under resonant sinusoidal excitation due to nonlinearity. 
However, the passive isolation case under non-design earthquake may not perform as 
well as itself subjected to design earthquake. Thus, semi-active control is considered 
to improve the performances of ERIS. Several switch control laws with low and high 
gain are investigated. The gain mode is switched by appropriate switch logic. When 
the system is subjected to a small earthquake, the low gain mode is taken to make sure 
that the system is effective. When the system is subjected to a large earthquake, the 
high gain mode is taken to reduce the base displacement and provide more energy 
dissipation. Moreover, the continuous type switch control law can mitigate the chatter 
and jerk which may occur for some discontinuous switch control law.

damping may increase the interstory drift for an isolated RC building under far-field 
earthquake. Besides, supplemental damping is effective in the absolute floor 
accelerations for both LRB and FPS under near-fault earthquake, but may increase the 
absolute floor accelerations under far-field earthquake. To reduce the base 
displacement without significantly increasing the potentially damaging isolation 
base-top floor drift response, a supplemental viscous damping isolation system may 
be provided but, at the same time, this supplemental damping must be carefully 
controlled to be limited to specific rages (e.g. 20% at most) to avoid the increase of 
drifts under near-fault earthquakes. Mazza and Volcano [30] investigated the 
nonlinear response of isolated RC building with supplemental damping under 
near-fault earthquake. It indicated that appropriate supplemental damping can 
effectively reduce base displacement but it cannot guarantee a better performance of 
superstructure. It depends on the frequency content of a near-fault earthquake. The 
Too high or too low damping ratio of the supplemental damping should be avoided. 
20% to 30% is a reasonable range for the supplemental damping ratio for the isolation 
system subjected to near-fault earthquake. Thus, these systems may not perform well 
when it is subjected to a seismic load that is significantly different from the design 
loads. 
Alternatively, in order to attenuate the low-frequency resonance-like problem 
mentioned above, some researchers have suggested using nonlinear isolation systems, 
whose isolation periods are not constants [18,31]. In literature, several types of 
nonlinear isolation systems have been proposed. Sliding isolators with variable 
curvature were proposed by Murnal and Sinha [18] and Lu [31,32]. It was observed in 
their studies that by using a variable curvature for the sliding surface of the isolators, 
the isolation frequency becomes a function of the isolator drift rather than a constant; 
therefore, the resonance-like effect, that the conventional seismic isolation (such as 
FPS) may encounter, can be mitigated. An FPS-like sliding isolator with variable 
curvature (SIVC) for the sliding surface was proposed by Lu et al [33]. The variable 
curvature is defined by a sixth-order polynomial function. Thus, the restoring force of 
the isolator is nonlinear due to the variable curvature of sliding surface. The hysteretic 
loop of the SIVC isolator possessed a softening-then-hardening behavior when the 
isolator is moved from the lowest position. Three design parameters including initial 
stiffness, critical displacement and stiffness at critical displacement are needed for 
defining the polynomial function. From the experimental and numerical results, the 
SIVC with third-order polynomial with frequency same as FPS may be an alternative 
choice. Jangid [17] proposed a nonlinear elliptical rolling isolation system, by which 
the seismic responses of a multistory building supported on elliptical rods were 
effectively reduced. Elliptical rolling rods were found to be better than the circular 
 4 
 
offer an alternative strategy [42-46]. Recently, by consensus effort of the ASCE 
structural control committee, well-defined analytical benchmark problems have been 
developed for studying the seismic performance of various smart base-isolated 
buildings structures [47-55]. Symans and co-workers [56] proposed a review study of 
comparisons between passive, active and semi-active structural control. In that 
research, it clearly demonstrates that semi-active control devices have a good 
potential for improving the seismic behavior of structures. Several familiar 
semi-active control devices are demonstrated and compared in that research: stiffness 
control device, electrorheological (ER) damper, magnetorheological (MR) damper, 
friction control device, fluid viscous damper and tuned mass damper. These 
semi-active devices in structural control are also applicable to isolation system and the 
effectiveness of these semi-active isolation systems has been proved by many 
researches [8,57-61]. Most popular semi-active control device is variable stiffness 
[43,44,62-64]. In semi-active control system, a control law to drive those control 
devices should be designed. Modulated homogeneous friction (MHF) [65], fuzzy 
[53,66-68], sliding mode [67,69] and neural control [53] are proposed and 
investigated in many researches. Comparing to the active isolation system, the 
semi-active cost less in control energy, and stability of the semi-active control system 
may be neglected.  
1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE THESIS 
In this study, a passive nonlinear isolation system called eccentric rolling 
isolation system (ERIS) is proposed. In this system, a mass block (representing 
structure or equipment) is pin connected to a set of circular rolling isolators, where 
each of the frictionless pin is connected eccentrically to the center of the isolator. In 
addition, it is assumed that the friction between the isolator and the ground is large 
enough so that no sliding but rolling will occur. The nonlinear governing equation of 
motion for the eccentric rolling isolation system is derived based on Lagrange’s 
equation. The variation of the linearized isolation frequency as a function of the 
eccentricity and initial angle will be investigated through free vibration analysis. The 
isolation performance of the system due to harmonic and seismic excitations will also 
be demonstrated and investigated in this study. Besides, the ERIS with semi-active 
control is also considered to improve the performances of the isolation system under 
non-design earthquakes. Several semi-active control laws including viscous damping 
(VD), discontinuous switch viscous damping (DSVD), continuous switch viscous 
damping (CSVD), window discontinuous switch viscous damping (WDSVD) and 
window continuous switch viscous damping (WCSVD) are verified the feasibility for 
the ERIS. In this study, four earthquakes are considered, far-field El Centro and Kobe, 
 6 
 
non-design earthquakes including different intensity and waveform. First, a 
semi-active control law, which is similar to nonlinear viscous damping, with a fixed 
gain is considered. However, a fixed gain cannot satisfy the different requirement of 
the isolation system under different excitations. Thus, a discontinuous switch viscous 
damping control law is used. Moreover, three modification of this switch control law 
including window discontinuous switch, continuous switch and window continuous 
switch viscous damping are also simulated and compared.  
Based on the simulation results for the ERIS in passive and semi-active mode, 
some conclusions are made. The feasibility and feature of the ERIS in passive are 
verified. The sensitivity of various structural parameters due to construction 
imperfection is also checked. Finally, semi-active control for the ERIS is also 
proposed to enhance the reliability and feasibility under non-design earthquakes.

so the mass of base (or platform) can be thought as a lumped mass at the pin. In this 
study, the rolling angle   and structural displacement sx  are the two degrees of 
freedom to describe the system motion and the 
gX  is the displacement of ground. 
Thus, the position vector 
iX  of the base is expressed as follows:

For the degree of freedom of rolling angle  , the corresponding 
non-conservative force should be a moment. In Figure 2.4, the normal force 
vN  from 
the ground is the vertical reaction force and the horizontal friction force 
gf  between 
the isolator is assumed to be large enough to guarantee that the only rolling behavior 
will occur. If the rolling acceleration of the isolator is in the clockwise direction, the 
friction force,
gf , is applied to the left to provide a clockwise moment to the isolator. 
When the reference point is considered as the center of circular isolator, the trajectory 
of the friction damper forms a quarter-cycle on the isolator with rolling angle equal to 
90 degrees. When the ERIS is in motion, the circular isolator can be considered as 
rotating around the pin and the rigid link keeps vertical during the motion. Therefore, 
the velocity of the friction damper relative to the isolator at the contact point keeps 
horizontal and the friction force of the damper, rf , remains horizontal (Appendix 2). 
Consequently, the energy is dissipated due to the non-conservative moment which is 
equal to the friction force ( rf ) multiplying the moment arm ( R ). The work done by

2.2 SIMPLIFICATION TO SINGLE-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM 
 SYSTEM 
 Once, the superstructure is considered as a rigid body, the whole system becomes 
a system with only one degree of freedom. Then, the Equation (22) can be reduced to 
single degree of freedom. Because there is no degree of freedom in structural 
displacement anymore, Equation (22a) is eliminated. And substituting 0s m  into 
Equation (22b), it gives

Equation (23) represents the dynamics of the ERIS when the isolation or

balance is used to simulate this kind of nonlinear systems [70,71]. In a dynamic 
system with friction, the motion of the system is in either slip or stick state. The 
system is assumed in stick state at the ( 1k )-st time step and the rolling velocity is 
zero at this moment. Adopting the first order Euler formula, the rolling velocity at the 
( 1k )-st step can be approximated by the rolling velocity and the rolling acceleration 
of the previous step as: 
      0
!1
1
1  ktkk    (25) 
 The rolling acceleration at the k -th step can be obtained by rewriting Equation 
(22a) and (22b) as: 
 14 
 
the k -th step can be calculated by Equation (27). Second, the real friction force can 
be determined by checking Equation (30). Third, the state of the system at the 
( 1k )-st step can be solved by Equation (22) after the real friction force is obtained. 
These procedures can be executed repeatedly until the whole time history is obtained. 
The ODE45 function in MATLAB software is adopted to solve this nonlinear 
numerical integration of Equation (22).

(Table 3.1). While the initial angle ( 0 ) equals 45 and 90 degrees, the corresponding 
responses are shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3, respectively. From the time histories of 
rolling angle (Figures 3.2(a) and 3.3(a)), they are close to cosine waves and the 
fundamental frequencies for the two cases are almost the same since the eccentricity 
1.0  is small. The nonlinear behavior is more evident in rolling acceleration, 
phase diagram and base shear - displacement relationship as initial angle ( 0 ) 
increases. When the initial angle ( 0 ) is 90 degrees, the rolling acceleration (Figure 
3.3(b)), the phase diagram (Figure 3.3(c)) and the base shear - displacement curve 
(Figure 3.3(d)) are no longer a cosine wave, an ellipse and a straight line, respectively.  
When the eccentricity ( ) is 0.5, the fundamental frequency of the system varies 
from 0.702(Hz) to 0.345(Hz) as the initial angle ( 0 ) increases from 5 to 90 degrees 
(Table 3.1). While the initial angle ( 0 ) equals 45 and 90 degrees, the responses are 
shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. From the time histories of rolling angle (Figures 3.4(a) 
and 3.5(a)), it is very clear that the fundamental frequency of the system decreases as 
the initial angle ( 0 ) becomes larger. When the initial angle ( 0 ) changes from 45 to 
90 degrees, the nonlinear behavior of the system becomes more and more evident as 
observed from the time histories of rolling acceleration (Figures 3.4(b) and 3.5(b)).  
As the initial angle ( 0 ) increases, the phase diagram transforms from ellipse into 
diamond (Figures 3.4(c) and 3.5(c)), and the relationship between base shear and 
horizontal displacement changes from a straight into a curved line (Figures 3.4(d) and 
3.5(d)). The degree of nonlinearity increases with the initial angle. In Figure 3.5(d), 
the tangent stiffness may be negative, but the secant stiffness is always positive. So, 
the system is stable (Appendix 3). 
All the peak values of rolling angle, rolling velocity and rolling acceleration are 
listed in Table 3.2. Under the same initial angle ( 0 ), the peak rolling velocity and 
acceleration increase with the eccentricity ( ). When the initial angle ( 0 ) is fixed at 
5 degrees, the peak values in rolling velocity increases from 5.50 (degree/sec) for 
eccentricity (  ) 0.1 to 22.1 (degree/sec) for eccentricity (  ) 0.5 and 148.5 
(degree/sec) for eccentricity ( ) 0.9, and the peak values in rolling acceleration 
increases from 6.04 (degree/sec2) for eccentricity ( ) 0.1 to 96.5 (degree/sec2) for 
eccentricity ( ) 0.5 and 2920 (degree/sec2) for eccentricity ( ) 0.9. Under free 
vibration, the response of the system is periodic where the fundamental frequency 
varies with the initial angle ( 0 ) and eccentricity ( ). Since the system is nonlinear, 
the vibration frequency changes with the rolling angle.

 20 
 
3.3 SYSTEM PARAMETERS OF ECCENTRICITY ROLLING  
ISOLATION SYSTEM 
The parameters of the ERIS are: m =1 ton, R =1 m and d =0.1. When the 
eccentricity ( ) equals 0.3, the linearized frequency ( 0f ) (Equation (24)) is 0.39 Hz. 
This linearized frequency belongs to the range from 0.33 to 0.5 Hz which is converted 
from the familiar isolation periods in the range from 2 to 3 seconds [1,3]. Therefore 
the eccentricity equal to 0.3 is selected. The undamped free vibration of the ERIS with 
different initial angles is simulated first by using Equation (23) and setting the friction 
force ( rf ) to be zero.  The fundamental frequency of the ERIS varies with the initial 
angle (Figure 3.1). When the initial angle increases from 5 to 90 degrees the 
fundamental frequency decreases from 0.389 to 0.258 Hz. The restoring force is 
provided by the eccentricity and the mass block. The system is stable as long as the 
rolling angle is within 180 degrees. Consequently, the ERIS is quite different from the 
linear system which the frequency of the system is fixed. 
The original far-field El Centro earthquake with PGA equal to 3.42 m/sec
2
 is 
selected to be the design earthquake. The normal force N  is optimized by 
minimizing the peak absolute acceleration of the mass block under the design 
earthquake (Figure 3.7(a)). When the normal force N  equals zero, the maximum 
absolute acceleration and maximum displacement of the ERIS are 2.49 m/sec
2
 and 
0.583 m, respectively. The ERIS without friction already shows some effectiveness 
from the acceleration ratio which is 0.727. The minimal absolute acceleration of the 
mass block occurs at the optimal normal force ( N ) equal to 12.15 kN. According to 
this optimal point, the maximum absolute acceleration and maximum displacement 
are 0.898 m/sec
2
 and 0.0647 m (Figure 3.7). The acceleration ratio is 0.263 due to the 
optimal normal force. From the results, the ERIS with friction damping is more 
effective in reducing displacement and acceleration responses than the one without 
damping. Besides, in practical application, the normal force can be reduced by 
implementing a material with higher friction coefficient (e.g. steel (mild) to steel 
(mild), friction coefficient: 0.5~0.6; steel (mild) to brass, friction coefficient: 0.4~0.5). 
3.4 SYSTEM PARAMETERS OF CORRESPONDING  
LINEAR ISOLATION SYSTEM 
In this corresponding linear system, the mass equals 1 ton which is the same as 
the ERIS. Its stiffness is converted from the linearized frequency of the ERIS as 
2
0 )2( fmk  . The rate of energy dissipation is controlled by the friction coefficient 
( i ) multiplied by the weight of the mass block, and this coefficient should be 
 22 
 
Obviously, the responses of the ERIS are smaller than the linear system. The 
frequency of the first cycle for the linear system and the ERIS are 0.3906 and 0.3636 
Hz. In Figure 3.9(b), the linear system is stick with residual displacement equal to 
0.0539 m after t =3.85 sec. For the ERIS, the system is stick with residual 
displacement equal to 0.0166 m after t =4.05 sec. 
From the results of free vibration, the responses of displacement and acceleration 
of the ERIS are smaller than the linear system when the friction parameters of the two 
systems are optimally designed. And the responses of the ERIS decay a little bit faster 
than the linear system. In hysteretic loops (Figure 3.9(c)), the absolute value of base 
shear of the ERIS is smaller than the linear system after half cycle due to nonlinearity, 
and the absolute value of displacement of the ERIS is also smaller at this moment.  
3.6 COMPARISONS OF TWO ISOLATION SYSTEMS  
UNDER FORCED VIBRATION: SINE WAVE 
The sine wave excitation is assigned with amplitude 0.981 m/sec
2
 (0.1 g) and 
duration 23 cycles. The amplitude increases gradually in the first three cycles until the 
desired amplitude 0.981 m/sec
2
 (0.1 g) is reached. Three excitation frequencies ( extf ), 
which are 0ext 5.0 ff  , 0ext ff   and 0ext 2 ff  , are considered to simulate the 
responses of the isolation system subjected to disturbances of low frequency, resonant 
and high frequency.  
In the case of 05.0 ffext  , total simulation time is 102.6 seconds. In 
acceleration, 1.82 and 1.79 (m/sec
2
) are the maximum absolute accelerations for the 
linear system and the ERIS, respectively (Table 3.5). The maximum displacements of 
the linear system and the ERIS are 0.217 and 0.226 m, respectively. From these 
results, the responses of the two isolation system are similar and both of the two 
systems are ineffective under this specific sine wave with lower frequency. 
In the case of 0ext ff  , total simulation time is 51.3 seconds. The absolute 
acceleration histories are shown in Figure 3.10(a), the maximum absolute 
accelerations of the linear system and the ERIS are 18.1 and 2.98 m/sec
2
, respectively 
(Table 3.5). These two maximum values are both larger than the excitation amplitude 
0.981 m/sec
2
 (0.1 g), so both of the two isolation systems are ineffective under this 
excitation. Figure 3.10(b) shows the displacement histories, the maximum 
displacement of the ERIS is 0.668 (m) (Table 3.5), which is 22.8% of the linear 
system. From the time histories of both displacement and acceleration, it is clear that 
the responses of the linear system increase rapidly and divergently due to the 
resonance [72]. However, the responses for the ERIS are magnified but bounded 
under this resonance case. The nonlinear behavior in the ERIS can be clearly observed 
 24 
 
the PGA of the far-field El Centro earthquake is extended from 0.491 to 7.85 m/sec
2
 
(0.05 to 0.8 g). The performances of the two systems are quite similar in both 
displacement and acceleration when the amplitude of the earthquake excitation is 
smaller than the design one (PGA: 3.42 m/sec
2
) (Figure 3.13). However, compared 
with the linear system, the isolation effect of the ERIS becomes better and better as 
the PGA of the excitation is getting larger and larger (Figure 3.13(a)). The higher the 
excitation intensity, the greater is the degree of the nonlinear behavior of the ERIS. 
Nonlinearity makes the ERIS more effective in reduction in absolute acceleration. 
The performances of the two systems are further investigated by using seismic 
excitation with different waveform, the near-fault Chi-Chi (TCU102) earthquake. The 
PGA of the excitation is scaled to 5.89 m/sec
2
 (0.6 g) (Figure 3.14(a)). The maximum 
absolute horizontal acceleration and acceleration ratio for the linear system are 9.85 
m/sec
2
 and 1.67, respectively. The maximum absolute horizontal acceleration and 
vertical acceleration for the ERIS are 3.32 m/sec
2
 and 3.38 m/sec
2
, respectively, and 
the horizontal acceleration ratio is 0.565 (Figure 3.14(b),(c) and Table 3.6). It is 
obvious that the linear system is ineffective but the ERIS is effective. Compared with 
the linear system, the absolute acceleration of the ERIS is not only much less in 
maximum value but also convergent in much faster rate (Figure 3.14(b)). The 
maximum displacement and velocity for the linear system are 1.55 m and 4.50 m/sec, 
respectively (Figure 3.14(d) and Table 3.6). For the ERIS, the maximum displacement 
and velocity are 1.47 m and 2.37 m/sec, respectively. Although the maximum 
displacements of the two systems are close, the vibration of the ERIS decays much 
faster than the linear system (Figure 3.14(d)). Unlike the situation under El Centro 
earthquake with the same PGA (Figure 3.12(e)), the nonlinear behavior of the ERIS 
under Chi-Chi earthquake is fully developed (Figure 3.14(e)).  The stiffness 
softening is very evident. Moreover, it is obvious that the hysteretic loops are not 
overlapped, this is mainly induced by the high order term (i.e. 22i sin 
Rm ) 
(Equation 23). Nonlinearity makes the ERIS superior to the linear one under 
near-fault earthquake.  
Similarly, the robustness of the two systems under the variation of intensity of 
the near-fault Chi-Chi earthquake is also studied. In Figure 3.15(a), the linear system 
is ineffective when the PGA is larger than 3.43 m/sec
2
 (0.35 g) and may be slightly 
effective when the PGA is smaller than 3.43 m/sec
2
 (0.35 g). Compared to the linear 
system, the effectiveness of the ERIS is much better than the linear system and it 
becomes better and better when the PGA increases. Observing the maximum absolute 
acceleration in Figure 3.15(b), the maximum absolute acceleration of the two system

4.2 IMPULSE RESPONSE 
 Free vibration can clearly demonstrate the dynamic behavior without involved 
by the influence of excitation. However, it is difficult to initial the state of the 
structure without isolation and with isolation due to the different degree of freedom 
for the two cases. Therefore, in this section, performances of structural isolation by 
linear system and the proposed ERIS are discussed and compared to the structure 
without isolation through impulse response. Due to the characteristics of 
nonlinearities in friction and eccentricity, appropriate amplitude of impulse should be 
considered to make sure that the nonlinear behavior of the ERIS can be observed. In 
Figure 4.3 shows the time history of the impulse excitation with amplitude equal to 40 
g at first time step. The sampling period equal to 0.005 sec and total time equal to 25 
seconds are taken. 
 Time history comparisons for the two systems are demonstrated in Figure 4.4. 
Figure 4.4a and b show the time histories of structural absolute acceleration. The peak 
value of structural absolute acceleration without isolation is 18.65 m/sec
2
; it is 
reduced to 4.75 and 3.30 m/sec
2
 with linear isolation and ERIS, respectively (Figure 
4.4). Thus, the two isolation systems are effective to reduce the structural absolute 
acceleration. Besides, the three root mean square of structural absolute acceleration 
for the structure without isolation, with linear isolation and with ERIS are 307.3, 
111.7 and 105.6 m/sec
2
, respectively. The peak value of the structural deformation 
without isolation is 0.194 m; it is reduced to 0.0494 and 0.0343 m for the linear 
isolation and ERIS, respectively (Table 4.2 and Figure 4.5). The root mean square of 
the structural deformation is also reduced from 3.20 m without isolation to 1.16 and 
1.10 with linear isolation and ERIS, respectively. Figure 4.6 shows the relationship of 
structural shear and structural deformation. It is clear that both of the shear and 
deformation for the structure isolated by ERIS are smaller than the one isolated by the 
linear isolation system. The time histories of base displacement are shown in Figure 
4.7. Comparing the two isolation systems, the peak value and root mean square of the 
base displacement for the linear isolation system are 0.75 and 19.26 m, respectively. 
Similarly, the peak and root mean square of the base displacement for the ERIS are 
0.878 and 23.42 m. Observing Figure 4.8, the nonlinear behavior of the structure 
isolated by the ERIS is evident. Due to this nonlinear characteristic of the ERIS, the 
maximum total base shear for the ERIS is smaller than the linear isolation system. 
Figure 4.9 shows the time histories of the friction force for the two isolation systems. 
In this figure, the linear isolation system is stick after roughly 16.25 sec, and the ERIS 
is stick after 20 sec. Thus, in this impulse case, the larger base displacement for the 
ERIS may induce the lower structural absolute acceleration. Figures 4.10 and 4.11 
show the hysteretic loop of friction damping for the linear system and ERIS, 
respectively. The area of the rectangular in Figures 4.10 and 4.11 are 0.5633 and 
0.5168 kN-m, respectively. Thus, the energy dissipations for the two systems under 
this impulse excitation are similar.  
4.3 SEISMIC EXCITATION 
 In this section, after the two structural isolation systems are designed by El 
Centro earthquake, the performances of the two systems are compared under four 
earthquakes with various intensities. The acceleration ratio is defined as a ratio of 
maximum structural absolute acceleration with isolation and without isolation (fixed 
on the ground). Therefore, a lower value of acceleration ratio represents better 
 46 
 
range for the ERIS. The acceleration ratio for the ERIS is much smaller than the linear 
isolation system especially when the PGA is larger. Different from the performances 
of the two systems under El Centro and Kobe earthquake, the best reduction of 
acceleration is close to 0.4 which is almost double of the best reduction under 
previous two earthquakes. In Figure 4.14b, the original performances of maximum 
structural absolute accelerations are compared. In this figure, generally, the maximum 
structural absolute accelerations for the three cases increase with the increasing of 
PGA, and it is clear that the maximum structural absolute acceleration for the 
structure without isolation is largest one of the three cases under any PGA. In other 
words, the two systems are effective with different level to reduce the structural 
acceleration response. When the PGA is smaller than 0.25 g, the performances of the 
two isolation system are similar. When the PGA increases from 0.25 to 0.6 g, the 
maximum structural absolute acceleration of the ERIS is much smaller than the liner 
isolation system. The maximum base displacements for the two systems are shown in 
Figure 4.14c. The maximum base displacements for the two system increase with the 
increasing of PGA. However, the maximum base displacement for the ERIS is larger 
than the linear isolation system especially when the PGA becomes larger and larger. 
The extreme maximum base displacement for the linear system equal to 1.3 m occurs 
when the PGA equals 0.6 g; but it is 2.6 m for the ERIS under the same PGA. 
 Chi-Chi earthquake is also considered, and the simulation results are shown in 
Figure 4.15. In Figure 4.15a, generally, the acceleration ratio for the linear isolation 
system increases with the increasing of the PGA. When the PGA is smaller than or 
equal to 0.15 g, the acceleration ratios for the two systems are close. However, the 
acceleration ratio decreases with the increasing of PGA; and it is much smaller than 
the linear isolation system when the PGA is larger than 0.15 g. These results can also 
be observed from Figure 4.15b which demonstrates the maximum structural absolute 
acceleration for the structure without isolation, with linear isolation and with ERIS. In 
this figure, the maximum structural absolute acceleration for the structure without 
isolation linearly increases with increasing of PGA; for the three cases, the structure 
without isolation has largest acceleration response when the PGA varies from 0.05 to 
0.65 g. After isolated by linear isolation system, the acceleration response is 
effectively reduced. While comparing the performance in acceleration for the two 
isolation systems, the ERIS possessing smallest maximum structural absolute 
acceleration is significantly better than the linear isolation system. Comparing the 
performance in base displacement for the two isolation systems in Figure 4.15c, the 
maximum base displacements increase with the increasing of PGA. When the PGA is 
smaller than or equal to 0.25 g, the maximum base displacements for the two systems 
are similar and not over 0.75 m. When the PGA is larger than 0.25 g, the maximum 
base displacement for the ERIS is smaller than the linear isolation system. As the 
PGA increases to 0.65 g, the maximum base displacements for the linear system and 
ERIS are 2.6 and 2.1 m, respectively. Therefore, when the Chi-Chi earthquake with 
PGA smaller than 0.65 g is considered, the ERIS performs better than the linear 
isolation system in both structural acceleration and base displacement. 
 Based on the simulation results and the comparisons of the two isolation systems, 
the ERIS may perform better in reduction of structural acceleration due to 
nonlinearity; however, this characteristic of the ERIS appears more evidently under 
larger displacement response. Thus, relative larger base displacement for the ERIS 
should be carefully designed before real application.  
 48 
 
Thus, after the two important quantities of structural isolation, maximum and RMS of 
structural acceleration, the structural displacement relative to the base is also 
discussed (Figures 4.16d and e). The structural deformations for the three cases 
generally decrease with the increasing of frequency ratio. The structural deformations 
for structure without isolation (fixed end) are much larger than the other two isolated 
cases. For maximum base displacement (Figure 4.16f), no matter what frequency ratio 
is, the maximum base displacement for the two isolation systems are not exceed 0.4 m; 
and ERIS is larger than the linear isolation system. Similarly, the RMSs of the base 
displacement are also compared in Figure 4.16g. The RMSs for the two isolation 
cases are very close when the frequency ratio is larger than or equal to 4. For the 
range of frequency ratio between 1 and 4, the RMS for the ERIS is slightly larger than 
the linear isolation system. The performances for the two isolation systems are very 
close in both maximum values and RMSs. Consequently, subjected to Kobe 
earthquake, the structural responses including acceleration and deformation are 
effectively reduced by the two isolation systems; the base displacements for the two 
isolation systems are similar; and the two isolation system are not sensitive to the 
structural frequency when the frequency ratio is larger than 4. 
 For the three cases subjected to Imperial Valley earthquake, the simulation of 
sensitivity to the frequency ratio is demonstrated in Figure 4.17. The ratios of 
structural absolute acceleration for the two systems increase then decrease with the 
increasing of frequency ratio. Generally, the two isolation system may reduce more 
acceleration response than the structure without isolation if the frequency ratio 
becomes larger. The ERIS system shows better reduction in acceleration than the 
linear system (Figure 4.17a). Comparing the maximum structural absolute 
accelerations for the three cases in Figure 4.17b, both of the two isolation cases are 
not sensitivity to the frequency ratio; and the ERIS possesses lower acceleration 
response than the linear isolation system. When the frequency ratio is small, the 
maximum structural absolute acceleration for the structure without isolation system 
may be similar to the two isolated structures; however, with increasing of frequency 
ratio, the maximum structural absolute acceleration for the structure without isolation 
becomes larger than the two isolated cases. In Figure 4.17c, root-mean-square 
structural absolute accelerations for the three cases are different from the performance 
of maximum structural absolute acceleration shown in Figure 4.17b. In this figure, the 
root mean square of structural absolute acceleration without isolation may be smaller 
than the two isolation cases with different level especially when the frequency ratio 
varies from 2 to 4. Thus, when the frequency ratio varies from 2 to 4, the two 
isolation systems reduce more peak value in acceleration response, but structure 
without isolation possessing 2% damping ratio performs well in root-mean-square of 
structural acceleration response. The maximum structural displacements relative to 
the base (structural deformation) and its root mean squares for the three cases are 
demonstrated in Figures 4.17d and e. From these two figures, the maximum 
deformation and its root mean squares for the three cases all decrease with the 
increasing of the frequency ratio, and they are very close under the specific range of 
frequency ratio. The maximum structural deformation for the structure without 
isolation is larger than the two isolated cases when the frequency ratio is larger than 3. 
However, in root-mean-square structural deformation, three cases are almost the same 
when the frequency ratio is larger than or equal to 5. In Figure 4.17f, it is obvious that 
the maximum base displacement for the ERIS is much larger than the linear isolation 
system to exchange lower acceleration response under Imperial Valley earthquake. 
Moreover, the maximum base displacements for the two isolation system are not 
 50 
 
shows that the two isolation systems can reduce structural absolute acceleration 
relative to the structure without isolation because the ratios are smaller than 1. The 
ERIS is better than the linear isolation system due to its smaller ratio of structural 
acceleration. The linear isolation system is not sensitive to the mass ratio because the 
ratio for the linear isolation system is roughly 0.8 no matter what mass ratio is. 
However, the ERIS is a little bit sensitive to the mass ratio when the mass ratio is 
small. If the mass ratio is larger than or equal to 3, the ERIS is also not sensitive to the 
mass ratio. Similar results can be observed in Figure 4.19b. The maximum structural 
absolute acceleration for the structure without isolation system is not sensitive to the 
mass ratio and larger than other two isolated structures. Then, the linear isolation 
system is secondary because the performance for the linear isolation system locates 
between the structure without isolation system and ERIS; and the linear isolation 
system is also not sensitive to the masse ratio. The ERIS shows best effectiveness 
which possesses smallest maximum acceleration under the specific range of mass 
ratio. Observing the relationship between root-mean-square structural absolute 
acceleration and mass ratio in Figure 4.19c, all of three cases are not sensitive to the 
mass ratio. Moreover, different results in Figure 4.19b can be seen in which the 
root-mean-square structural absolute accelerations for the structure without isolation 
system are all smaller than the other two isolated structures. The linear isolation 
system possesses largest root mean squares, then, the ERIS is secondary. Comparing 
Figures 4.19b and c, it shows that the two isolation systems perform better in 
reduction of maximum structural absolute acceleration but worse in root-mean-square 
of structural absolute acceleration. This result may be caused by Imperial Valley 
earthquake which is a long-period seismic excitation. The long-period Imperial Valley 
earthquake may amplify the response of the two isolation systems also possessing 
long period. However, the structure without isolation system is assumed that the 
fundamental frequency of structure is 4 times the isolation frequency, thus this 
structure without isolation may not be amplified due to the Imperial Valley earthquake. 
The maximum and root-mean-square structural deformations for the three cases are 
shown in Figures 4.19d and e. From these two figures, similar result, which is 
concluded from Figures 4.19b and c, can be observed. The structure without isolation 
system possesses largest maximum structural deformation but it also possesses 
smallest root-mean-square structural deformation. Comparing the two isolation 
systems, the ERIS is better than the linear isolation system in both maximum and 
root-mean-square structural deformation. The better performance in acceleration for 
the ERIS may be exchanged by the larger base displacement (Figure 4.19f). In Figure 
4.19f, the base displacement for ERIS is much larger than the linear isolation system; 
and both of the two isolation systems are not sensitive to the mass ratio under the 
specific range of mass ratio. The difference of maximum base displacement between 
the linear isolation system and ERIS is roughly equal to 0.4 m. In Figure 4.19g, the 
root-mean-square base displacement for the ERIS is larger than the linear isolation 
system, and both of the two systems are not sensitive to the mass ratio.  
4.4.3 Sensitivity of structural damping ratio 
 In this subsection, structural damping ratio varying from 0 to 5% is considered to 
verify the sensitivity of structural damping for the three cases. Subjected to Kobe 
earthquake, the simulation results are shown in Figure 4.20. In Figure 4.20a, the 
relationship between the ratio of maximum structural absolute acceleration and 
structural damping ratio shows that the ratio of structural acceleration increases with 
 52 
 
both maximum and root-mean-square structural absolute acceleration. The maximum 
and root-mean-square structural deformations are shown in Figures 4.21d and e, 
respectively. In Figure 4.21d, the maximum structural deformations for the structures 
without isolation system are larger than other two isolated structures. The ERIS is 
most effective to reduce the maximum structural deformation than the linear isolation 
system. However, again, the structure without isolation system may possess smallest 
root-mean-square structural deformation if the structural damping ratio becomes 
larger. The reason is the same as mentioned earlier in description about structural 
acceleration. The two isolation systems are also not sensitive to the structural 
damping ratio in responses of structural deformation. The sensitivities of base 
displacement to the structural damping ratio are shown in Figures 4.21f and g. In 
these two figures, both of two isolation systems are not sensitive to the structural 
damping ratio. The ERIS is larger than the linear isolation system in both maximum 
and root-mean-square base displacement. Consequently, subjected to Imperial Valley 
earthquake, the ERIS performs better than the linear isolation system in response of 
structural acceleration but larger base displacement response in return when 
comparing the performances of the two isolation systems. Moreover, the structure 
without isolation systems may perform better than the two isolation systems in root 
mean square of structural acceleration and structural deformation if the structural 
damping ratio is large enough. This result can be explained by the amplification of 
two isolation systems due to Imperial Valley earthquake. 
4.5 SUMMARY 
 Based on the simulation results in Chapter 4, some summaries for the ERIS 
implemented in structural isolation can be made. The advantages in ERIS 
implemented in equipment isolation are still remained in structural isolation. Both of 
the ERIS and corresponding linear isolation system in structural isolation perform 
well in structural acceleration and base displacement under El Centro and Kobe 
earthquakes. When the two systems are subjected to Imperial Valley and Chi-Chi 
earthquakes, the response of structural acceleration for the ERIS is much smaller than 
the corresponding linear isolation system due to nonlinearity of the ERIS. This 
advantage of the ERIS due to nonlinearity is triggered when the base displacement is 
large enough. Thus, the maximum base displacement for the ERIS is larger than the 
corresponding linear isolation system under these two near-fault earthquakes.  
 In sensitivity study, three structural parameters including frequency ratio, mass 
ratio and structural damping ratio are considered. From the simulation results, 
generally, the ERIS and linear isolation system are not sensitive to the frequency ratio, 
mass ratio and structural damping ratio, and their performances are similar under 
Kobe and Imperial Valley earthquakes. However, the effectiveness of the ERIS is still  
better than the linear isolation system under Imperial Valley earthquake even if any 
one of the three parameters is not the same as the expected one.

by a control law which the control force from the control law is proportional to the 
displacement. This kind of control law may induce that the isolation frequency is 
raised due to this displacement type of semi-active control law. On the other hand, the 
isolation frequency may be just a little bit influenced by the viscous type of control 
law. For a simple linear mass-spring system, the absolute acceleration is calculated 
from the combination of restoring force and damping force. The displacement and 
velocity will not reach the maximum value at the same time. In other words, the 
viscous type of damping force may not increase the absolute acceleration of system 
while the system possesses maximum restoring force. Thus, a control law similar to 
viscous damping (VD) is considered in this part. Moreover, more sensors bring more 
expense, thus, only rolling velocity of ERIS is measured. The first simple type of 
control law is expressed as: 

 )()( tGtN   (32) 
where G  is the gain;   is the exponent for nonlinearity. The exponent with range 
from 0.35 to 1 is considered in practical application [74]. The larger gain is needed if 
the isolation system is subjected to an earthquake with low-frequency content. To 
design the gain with the specific range of exponent, two design earthquakes, the El 
Centro and Imperial Valley, are considered. Based on the minimization of peak 
structural absolute acceleration under these two design earthquakes, the optimal gains 
of each exponent are designed and shown in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Subjected to far-field 
El Centro earthquake, the optimal gain increases from 13.3 to 23  rad/seckN  with 
increasing of the exponent from 0.3 to 1. At the same time, the acceleration ratio 
varies from 0.112 to 0.129 which means the isolation system is quite effective due to 
these optimal gains. For the maximum base displacement, the case with exponent 
equal to 1 possesses largest maximum base displacement equal to 0.116 m, and other 
exponent cases are all smaller than 0.116 m. Generally, for these exponent cases, the 
isolation systems are effective and the performances are close under this specific 
design earthquake, El Centro earthquake. 
 Three exponent cases including 0.3, 0.6 and 1 are selected to simulate and 
compare their robustness under different excitations. The simulation results of the 
three exponents with corresponding gains designed by El Centro but subjected to 
Kobe earthquake are shown in Figure 5.1. In Figure 5.1a, the acceleration ratios show 
that the three exponent cases perform well because the maximum structural absolute 
accelerations are reduced to roughly 10% of those without isolation. The three cases 
are very close to each other when the PGA is larger than 0.4 g. When the PGA is 
smaller than 0.4 g, the acceleration ratios for the two cases with exponent equal to 0.3 
and 0.6 decrease with increasing of PGA, and the two cases are larger than the case 
with exponent equal to 1. Figure 5.1b shows the relationships between the maximum 
structural absolute acceleration and PGA. The maximum structural absolute 
accelerations for the three cases increase with increasing of PGA. The maximum 
structural absolute accelerations are not over 2.25 m/sec
2
 when the PGA is 1 g. In 
Figure 5.1c, the maximum base displacements for the three cases also increase with 
increasing of PGA, and their performances are very close. The extreme value of 
maximum base displacement is not over 0.35 m under Kobe earthquake with 
amplitude equal to 1 g. Figure 5.1d demonstrates the relationships between the 
maximum normal force and PGA. It can be realized that the maximum normal force 
increases with increasing of PGA. The maximum normal forces for the three cases are 
not quite different when the PGA is smaller than 0.35 g. Nevertheless, the difference 
becomes larger when the PGA increases.   
 86 
 
the case with exponent equal to 1 is not over 4.25 m/sec
2
 under 1-g Kobe earthquake. 
Figure 5.3c shows the relationships between the maximum base displacement and 
PGA. The maximum base displacements for the three cases increase with increasing 
of intensity. The performances for the three exponent cases in maximum base 
displacement are close. The maximum base displacements for the three cases are not 
over 0.14 m when the PGA is 1 g. The performances of normal force for the three 
cases are shown in Figure 5.3d. Basically, with different level of performances, the 
normal forces for the three exponent cases increase with the increasing of intensity. 
The extreme value of maximum normal force is not over 80 kN for the case with 
exponent equal to 1 when the PGA is 1 g.  
 Similarly, after the three cases designed by Imperial Valley and subjected to 
Kobe earthquake are simulated. The excitation is replaced by Chi-Chi earthquake, and 
the simulation results are shown in Figure 5.4. In Figure 5.4a, the acceleration ratios 
for the three cases generally locate between 0.2 and 0.3. But the acceleration ratios for 
these two cases with exponent equal to 0.3 and 0.6 are relative large when the PGA is 
small. Thus, the case with exponent equal to 1 may be more robust than the other two 
cases in acceleration reduction. The relationships of maximum structural absolute 
acceleration and PGA show that the performances for the three cases are not quite 
different (Figure 5.4b). They all increase with increasing of PGA. If the PGA is larger 
than 0.5 g, the maximum structural absolute accelerations for the case with exponent 
equal to 1 are a little bit larger than the other two exponent cases. When the PGA is 1 
g, the maximum structural absolute accelerations are not over 8 m/sec
2
. In Figure 5.4c, 
the maximum base displacements for the three cases increase with increasing of PGA. 
When the PGA is smaller than or equal to 0.4 g, the three cases are very close. But, 
when the PGA is larger than 0.4 g, the case with exponent equal to 0.3 possesses the 
largest maximum base displacements. At the same time, the case with exponent equal 
to 1 possesses the smallest base displacements. This result can be linked to how large 
the damping force is. Observing Figure 5.4d, when the PGA is larger than 0.3 g, the 
case with exponent equal to 1 provides the largest normal force, and the case with 
exponent equal to 0.3 provides the smallest normal force. Therefore, the difference of 
base displacement between the cases with exponent equal to 0.3 and 1 can be 
explained.  
 From the simulation results above, the nonlinear viscous type semi-active control 
law is a possible choice to implement for the ERIS. The performances are different 
due to the two different design earthquakes, El Centro and Imperial Valley. Based on 
the simulation result, generally speaking, the semi-active isolation with exponent 
equal to 1 is more robust than the other two exponents. For the case with exponent 
equal to 1, the behavior of the semi-active isolation system is very close to the linear 
system under Kobe earthquake, because the damping force is linear, and the restoring 
force is also very close to linear for the ERIS due to small displacement response. 
However, if a semi-active case with exponent smaller than 1 is considered and 
designed by El Centro earthquake, the performance of the maximum structural 
absolute acceleration is not so well under Chi-Chi earthquake with large intensity. On 
the other hand, if a semi-active case with exponent smaller than 1 is considered and 
designed by Imperial Valley earthquake, the performance of the acceleration ratio is 
not so well under both Kobe and Chi-Chi earthquakes with small intensity. Thus, a 
fixed gain for the nonlinear viscous type semi-active control law designed by a 
specific design earthquake may not satisfy the requirement of effectiveness under an 
unpredictable seismic excitation including different frequency content and intensity.  
 88 
 
5.5d. It is clear that the maximum normal forces for the high gain case are much 
larger than the other two cases. On the contrary, the low gain case possesses the 
smallest maximum normal forces no matter what PGA is. For the DSVD case, it is the 
same as the low gain case when the PGA is smaller than or equal to 0.35 g; and close 
to the high gain case when the PGA is larger than 0.35 g.  
 Similarly, the three cases subjected to Chi-Chi earthquake are also investigated. 
Figure 5.6a shows the performances of the three cases in acceleration ratio. In this 
figure, the three semi-active cases are effective, and the acceleration ratios for the 
high gain case are larger than the ones for the low gain case under the specific range 
of intensities especially when the PGA is small. For the DSVD case, it is the same as 
the low gain case when the PGA is small, and close to the high gain case when the 
PGA becomes large. Therefore, the DSVD can improve the isolation performance 
under seismic excitation with small intensity. In Figure 5.6b, the maximum structural 
absolute accelerations for the three cases increase with increasing of intensity. The 
maximum structural absolute accelerations for the high gain case are larger than the 
low gain case when the intensity varies from 0.05 to 1 g. The DSVD case is a 
compromise between the low and high gain cases; it is the same as the low gain case 
under small PGA and close to the high gain case under large PGA. Although the low 
gain case performs better than the other two cases when the PGA is from 0.3 to 0.9 g, 
the corresponding maximum base displacements for the low gain case are much larger 
than the other two cases (Figure 5.6c). Generally, the maximum base displacements 
for the low gain case are larger than the high gain case no matter what PGA is. For the 
DSVD case, it is the same as the low gain case when the PGA is smaller than or equal 
to 0.2 g. Once the intensity becomes larger than 0.2 g, the maximum base 
displacements for the DSVD case are close to the high gain case. The performances 
for the three cases in maximum normal force are shown in Figure 5.6d. The maximum 
normal forces for the high gain case are much larger than the ones for the low gain 
case. The DSVD case is the same as the low gain case under smaller PGA, and then it 
is similar to the high gain case when the PGA becomes larger and larger. 
Consequently, the discontinuous switch viscous damping control law improves the 
effectiveness when the PGA is small, and it also performs not bad in acceleration with 
good reduction of base displacement when the PGA is large. This result is what the 
nonlinear viscous damping control law with one fixed gain cannot reach.  
 After the performances for the DSVD control law are simulated and compared 
under Kobe and Chi-Chi earthquake with various intensities, the time history analysis 
is also demonstrated. Kobe earthquake with amplitude equal to 0.8 g is considered. 
Total simulation time is 40.1 seconds, and only first 30 seconds are demonstrated. 
Figure 5.7 shows the time history of structural absolute acceleration. In this figure, the 
maximum structural absolute acceleration for the fixed end case and the isolated case 
are 22.56 m/sec
2
 and 2.86 m/sec
2
, respectively.
 
Similarly, the root mean square of 
acceleration is reduced from 4.66 to 0.449 m/sec
2
 after isolated. Thus, the structure 
isolated by ERIS with DSVD control law is effective. The maximum structural 
displacement relative to the base (structural deformation) is reduced from 0.235 to 
0.030 m (Figure 5.8). For the root mean square of structural deformations for the 
structure with and without isolation are 0.0485 and 0.0047 m, respectively. The 
relationship between the shear of structure and structural deformation is shown in 
Figure 5.9. In this figure, it tells that, after isolated, the superstructure is safer than the 
one without isolation due to smaller hysteretic loop. The time history of base 
displacement is shown in Figure 5.10. The maximum and root-mean-square values are 
0.157 and 0.029 m, respectively. The relationship between the total base shear and 
 90 
 
5.18). The sigmoid function is used to switch the two gains, 1G  and 2G , 
continuously. In Equation (34), the sigmoid function is also a functional of rolling 
velocity; therefore, no more sensors are required. Besides, the switch behavior is 
controlled by two parameters:   is an offset to determine the rolling velocity at 
which   221 GG   will occur.   is a scaling factor to normalize the rolling 
velocity into appropriate range for the sigmoid function input. Based on this 
continuous switch viscous damping control law, engineer can design two different 
gains and one exponent to satisfy two objectives, effectiveness of far-field and 
near-fault earthquakes, in real application. To determine the scaling factor  , an 
indirect way is used by introducing a parameter  . This parameter   is also a shift 
of rolling velocity. Substituting the switching point   into the sigmoid function, it 
outputs 0.5 (i.e. 5.0)( f ). If substituting   and   into the sigmoid 
function, it outputs 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. In other words,   determines that the 
transition of the sigmoid function is steep or gently. Therefore, the scaling factor can 
be calculated after the parameter   is decided. Taking )( f  as example:

For the switch point of rolling velocity  , same design procedures in DSVD are used. 
The mean of the two averages equal to 0.66 rad/se, the differences equal to 0.1 
between the this mean value and two averages are assigned to  . Substituting   
equal to 0.1 into Equation (36), it gives the scaling factor   equal to 22, and   
equal to 20 is implemented in the following numerical simulation. For the two gains 
1G  and 2G  which represent the low and high gains, respectively. The two optimal 
gains for the case with exponent equal to 0.3 designed by El Centro and Imperial 
Valley earthquakes are chosen for the 1G  and 2G , respectively. Thus, the proposed 
semi-active control law shown in Equation (34) is ready to simulate the isolation 
performances.  
 After those control parameters for the proposed switch semi-active control law 
are designed. The control performances of the semi-active isolation system are 
investigated under Kobe earthquake with various intensities (Figure 5.19). In Figure 
5.19a, the performances of the acceleration ratio under various intensities show that 
the three cases including the low gain, high gain and CSVD are effective to reduce the 
acceleration response. For the low and high gain cases, the acceleration ratios 
decrease with increasing of intensity. The low gain case is better than the high gain 
case due to smaller acceleration ratio. For the CSVD case, the acceleration ratios are 
the same as the low gain case when the intensity is smaller than or equal to 0.35 g. 
Figure 5.19b shows the relationships between the maximum structural absolute 
acceleration and intensity. In this figure, the maximum structural absolute 
accelerations for the three cases generally increase with increasing of PGA. Under the 
specific range of intensities, the high gain case possesses the largest maximum 
structural absolute accelerations; and the low gain case possesses the smallest 
maximum structural absolute accelerations. For the CSVD case, it is very close to the 
low gain case when the PGA is smaller than or equal to 0.35 g; when the PGA is 
 92 
 
are compared. The time histories of structural absolute acceleration of the two cases 
are shown in Figure 5.21. The peak values for the DSVD and CSVD are both 4.58 
m/sec
2
. Similarly, the root mean squares of structural absolute acceleration for the two 
cases are 0.784 and 0.780 m/sec
2
, respectively. The time histories of structural 
displacement relative to the base (deformation) are shown in Figure 5.22. The 
maximum and root-mean-square values of structural displacement relative to the base 
(deformation) for the DSVD are 0.0476 and 0.0082, and similarly, 0.0477 and 0.0081 
for the CSVD case. The performances of the superstructure isolated by the two cases 
are very close which can also be observed from Figure 5.23. The time histories of 
base displacements are shown in Figure 5.24. The maximum and root-mean-square 
values of base displacement for the DSVD case are 0.65 and 0.10 m, respectively. For 
the CSVD case, the root-mean-square of base displacement is the same as DSVD case 
and the maximum base displacement equal to 0.658 m is slightly larger than the 
DSVD case. The best improvement from DSVD to CSVD can be observed in Figure 
5.25 whish shows the hysteretic loops for the two cases. In this figure, chatter and jerk 
for the DSVD case are serious. However, chatter and jerk are both greatly mitigated 
by CSVD case. Because the exponent equal to 0.3 is close to zero which is a passive 
isolation case for the ERIS, the loop forms a parallelogram when the response is small. 
However, as responses become larger and larger, high gain mode is turned on to 
provide more energy dissipation. The gain mode is determined by the rolling velocity, 
thus the time history of rolling velocity is shown in Figure 5.26. From this figure, the 
maximum rolling velocities for the DSVD and CSVD cases are 1.87 and 1.88 rad/sec, 
respectively. The high gain mode is reached under just several large oscillations due 
to the switch velocity equal to 0.65 rad/sec. For the time histories of normal force 
shown in Figure 5.27, the peak value and root mean square for the DSVD are 54.8 
and 13.0 kN, respectively; similarly, 54.9 and 12.8 kN for the CSVD case. The 
dominated time of normal forces concentrate on 10 to 25 seconds. The time histories 
of variable gain are demonstrated in Figure 5.28. Similar to the normal force, the 
switching occurs at 10 to 25 seconds which is also the dominated range of the ground 
motion. The relationships between the normal force and rolling velocity are shown in 
Figure 5.29. In this figure, for the CSVD case, the normal force is controlled by the 
low gain when the rolling velocity is smaller than 0.55 rad/sec. When the rolling 
velocity is in the range from 0.55 to 0.75, the normal force is controlled by the 
transition part of sigmoid function. After rolling velocity is larger than 0.75 rad/sec, 
the high gain mode is taken to provide larger normal force. For the DSVD case, the 
outputting of normal force is definitely separated by the switch point equal to 0.65 
rad/sec. Similarly, the relationships between the variable gain and rolling velocity are 
shown in Figure 5.30. The concept of the proposed switch semi-active control law can 
be verified by this figure. The low gain mode is taken when the rolling velocity is 
small, then high gain mode is turned on when the rolling velocity is large enough.  
5.3.2 Smooth by time window 
 In last subsection, the advantage of continuous switch viscous damping control 
law (CSVD) shows its worth to improve the chatter and jerk. However, the variable 
gain in CSVD are adjusted instantaneously. In a cyclic oscillation, the high gain mode 
may be implemented just for a very short time then changed to the low gain case due 
to the varying of rolling velocity. This may also induce insufficient energy dissipation 
in each cyclic oscillation. Thus, the DSVD and CSVD are both modified by a time 
window which can make a gain mode implementing for a specific time interval.  
 The modification for the DSVD is shown as follows: 
 94 
 
close to 0.4 g, the acceleration suddenly becomes very large for the WDSVD case, but 
it smoothly becomes higher for the WCSVD case. The variations of maximum base 
displacement versus PGA are shown in Figure 5.31c. The maximum base 
displacements for the two cases are similar. The maximum base displacements 
generally increase from 0.01 m to 0.15 m for the two cases under the specific range of 
PGAs. For the maximum normal forces shown in Figure 5.31d, the variation with 
intensity in the two cases is similar to that for the maximum structural absolute 
accelerations shown in Figure 5.31b. When the PGA is larger than 0.35 g, the high 
gain mode for the two cases are switched on. Thus, the maximum structural absolute 
accelerations for the two cases become worse to get smaller base displacements. 
 After the performances for the two cases are compared under Kobe earthquake, 
the earthquake is replaced by Chi-Chi earthquake. The simulation results are shown in 
Figure 5.32. Figure 5.32a shows that the two semi-active cases are effective to reduce 
acceleration responses relative to the structure without isolation. Most of the 
acceleration ratios for the two cases are generally locates between 0.2 to 0.3. The 
acceleration ratio for the WDSVD suddenly increases to 0.5 when the PGA is 0.2 g. 
Same results can also be observed from Figure 5.32b which shows the variations of 
maximum structural absolute acceleration under various intensities. Generally, the 
maximum structural absolute accelerations for the two cases increase from 0.5 to 6.6 
m/sec
2
 when the PGA increases from 0.05 to 1 g. Different from the performances for 
the two cases under Kobe earthquake, the maximum base displacements for the two 
cases are much larger under Chi-Chi earthquake. The maximum bases displacements 
for the two cases are similar. It increases from 0.02 m to 1.7 m under the specific 
range of intensity (Figure 5.32c). Observing the performances in maximum normal 
force for the two cases in Figure 5.32d, the switch occurs when the PGA falls between 
0.15 and 0.3 g. Comparing the WDSVD and WCSVD cases, the WCSVD is more 
smooth than the WDSVD case.  
5.4 SUMMARY 
 From the simulation for the ERIS with several proposed semi-active control laws, 
the isolation performances are improved so that the isolation system may perform 
better when the system is disturbed by a non-design earthquake. For the semi-active 
control in VD case, the performances are quite similar no matter what exponent is 
used under design earthquake. If the VD is designed by far-field El Centro earthquake 
(low gain) and subjected to Chi-Chi earthquake, the base displacement is large. On 
the other hand, if the ERIS with VD is designed by near-fault Imperial Valley 
earthquake (high gain), the effectiveness in reduction of acceleration may not so well 
under an earthquake with small intensity. Basically, the VD with exponent equal to 1 
designed by Imperial Valley shows good performance and better robustness under 
both Kobe and Chi-Chi earthquakes.  
 The switch control law including DSVD, CSVD, WDSVD and WCSVD all not 
only improve the effectiveness under small PGA but also reduce the base 
displacement under large PGA of earthquake. Moreover, the disadvantages, chatter 
and jerk, in discontinuous switch control are significantly mitigated by the proposed 
continuous switch control law. The continuous type control laws are also more robust 
than the passive ERIS. Therefore, the proposed CSVD and WCSVD are possible 
choices to improve the performances for the ERIS.

Based on the simulation results above, some conclusions can be summarized. Generally, 
the proposed eccentric rolling isolation system (ERIS) is effective with appropriate design. 
The passive case of ERIS already shows its characteristics due to nonlinearity of restoring 
force especially when the system is subjected a resonant excitation or near-fault earthquake. 
The feasibility of the ERIS with semi-active control is verified. The semi-active ERIS with 
appropriate control law shows that the effectiveness is improved under small intensity and the 
base displacement is significant reduced under large intensity. Besides, the continuous type of 
switch control law is much better than the discontinuous switch control because the chatter 
and jerk can be obviously mitigated.  
1. Passive equipment isolation by ERIS without damping 
For un-damped equipment isolation by ERIS, in free vibration, it shows the variation of 
frequency of isolator. The fundamental frequency of the system changes with eccentricity ( ) 
and initial angle ( 0 ). If the oscillating angle is large, the fundamental frequency of the 
system is lower. In other words, the fundamental frequency of the system is higher if the 
oscillating angle is small. When the eccentricity ( ) equals zero, the weight of the mass 
block applies at the center of the isolator. The frequency of the system is zero, and it is pure 
rolling behavior. If the eccentricity ( ) is larger, the nonlinear behavior is more evident. It is 
a periodic motion but the frequency is not fixed when eccentricity ( ) is greater than 0 and 
less than 1 ( 10  ). In each period, the frequency of isolator is changing with time. The 
choice of eccentricity ( ) affects the responses of displacement, velocity and acceleration. 
When the eccentricity ( ) is larger, the frequency of the system is higher. Smaller amplitude 
in the displacement response and larger amplitude in acceleration response are resulted. On 
the contrary, if the eccentricity ( ) is smaller and the pin is closer to the center of the isolator, 
the frequency of the system is lower and better effect can be achieved in acceleration but 
worse effect in displacement. From this outcome, the choice of eccentricity ( ) is the 
compromise between the amplitudes of acceleration and displacement. A good choice of 
eccentricity ( ) is that both the reduction in acceleration and amplitude in displacement are 
acceptable. 
2. Passive isolation by ERIS with friction damping 
A well-designed isolation system should possess damping to dissipate energy from 
external disturbance. Thus, friction damping, which is tuned by normal force, is considered. 
For equipment isolation case by ERIS with damping, the feasibility and the robustness of the 
proposed eccentric rolling isolation system (ERIS) with additional friction damping is verified 
successfully through simulations with different types of non-design excitations. The ERIS 
with friction damping shows that it is superior to the corresponding linear isolation system. 
The friction parameters for the two systems are designed by minimizing the absolute 
acceleration of the mass block under 100% El Centro earthquake. The performances of the 
two systems are very close under the design earthquake. In free vibration, the simulation 
results show that the response of the ERIS decays a little bit faster than the linear system. If 
the excitation changes to sinusoidal excitation with amplitude equal to 0.981 m/sec
2
 (0.1 g), 
the responses are divergent for the linear system but convergent for the ERIS under resonance.

exponent with corresponding low gain case may require larger normal force when the 
intensity is large. Moreover, subjected to Chi-Chi earthquake, low gain cases are also 
effective but much large base displacements are required. For high gain cases, they are also 
effective under both El Centro and Chi-Chi earthquake with various intensities. These high 
gain cases also perform well in reduction of base displacement. However, the performance in 
acceleration under small intensities for these high gain cases may perform worse than the ones 
under high intensities, especially when the small exponent is used.  
 Therefore, the semi-active control law with switching gain is considered. For the 
discontinuous switch viscous damping (DSVD), it improves the effectiveness under small 
earthquake and also performs well under large earthquake. However, the chatter and jerk, 
which may induce worse acceleration reduction, may occur under seismic excitation. Thus, 
the continuous switch viscous damping control law (CSVD) is used to mitigate the chatter and 
jerk. The transition part of switching is controlled by a sigmoid function. From time history 
analysis, the chatter and jerk are both significantly reduced due to the continuous switch 
behavior. Finally, the DSVD and CSVD control laws with time window are also investigated. 
Basically, the time window can keep a gain mode for a fixed and specific time interval. Thus, 
the control law may keep a high gain mode to provide more damping force. From the 
simulation results, the WDSVD and WCSVD perform well under both Kobe and Chi-Chi 
earthquakes, but the WCSVD is smoother than the WDSVD due to continuous switch 
behavior.    
6.2 SUGGESTION OF ADVANCED RESEARCH 
Base isolation system has been studied and made into practical application in civil and 
mechanical engineering. In civil engineering, time history analysis under a specific design 
earthquake is basic for engineer to design an isolation system. However, this isolation system 
may perform well under that design earthquake, but worse or invalid under a non-design 
earthquake which is significantly different from the design one. In this paper, a non-design 
earthquake in different intensity and waveform for far-field and near-fault earthquake has 
been considered to show the influence of the performance for an isolation system designed by 
a specific design earthquake. The isolation system may not always perform well and satisfy 
the requirement under a seismic loading with various intensities or different waveform. Thus, 
any procedure which can improve the performance of isolation system to satisfy multi 
objectives should be studied and proposed.  
Benefit of a passive isolation system possessing some kind of nonlinearity including 
nonlinear restoring force and damping has been proved. Source of nonlinearity for restoring 
force and damping force can be roughly separated into nonlinearity of geometry and material. 
New material can be implemented for practical application in civil engineering and new 
geometry of mechanism can also be considered in design procedures.  
For semi-active isolation system, many novel semi-active control laws for a common 
isolation system with linear restoring force have been proposed and investigated. However, 
for an isolation system with nonlinear restoring force, semi-active control law should be 
addressed. Moreover, different semi-active isolation mechanisms are popular in academic 
research and some real applications including variable friction, damping and stiffness. 
Therefore, innovative mechanism for semi-active isolation system is also valuable to develop.  
For ERIS, different combinations of radius and eccentricity can be further discussed. 
Besides, experimental verification is also needed. Both of different sigmoid function and size 
of time window should be investigated and compared for the smooth in control force.

In Equation (a3), the denominator is always positive, but numerator is positive only 
when  1cos .  Therefore, the tangent stiffness is negative when  1cos . 
As a whole, the tangent stiffness of the system may be negative but the secant

the restoring force of the isolator will be positive. As a result, the isolation system will

Given the structural mass ratio, structural frequency ratio and structural damping ratio, the optimization, eq. (6), becomes a 
polynomial equation of degree four in isolation damping ratio. The optimal isolation damping ratio can be solved by using the 
command ‘solve’ in MATLAB software. Taking the frequency ratio 0.4f R  as an example, variation of the optimal 
isolation damping ratio with the structural mass ratio and the structural damping ratio is shown in Fig. 1. 
If there is no damping in the structure, 0s  , eq. (6) can be reduced to a polynomial equation of degree two and the 
optimal isolation damping ratio is solved as:

CASE STUDY 
 
A structure is reduced to single degree of freedom with natural frequency  Hz6.1s f  and damping ratio %2s  . When 
isolation system with frequency  Hz4.0i f  is implemented, the structural mass ratio is 7.0m R  and the structural 
frequency ratio is 0.44.06.1f R . If the ground acceleration is assumed to be white noise, solved from eq. (6), the optimal
