Figure 1. Time courses of visual stimulations in (a) MEG and (b) fMRI measurements. 
 
Data acquisition: Visual evoked fields were recorded with a whole-head 160-channel coaxial gradiometer 
(PQ1160C, Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo, Japan). The magnetic responses were digitized at a sampling rate of 
1000 Hz and filtered by a bandpass filter from 0.1 to 200 Hz. For off-line analysis, the nonperiodic 
low-frequency noise in the MEG raw data was reduced using a continuously adjusted least-squares method 
[16]. About 100 epochs obtained 600 ms before and 500 ms after the motion start were picked for averaging 
after removing artifacts with amplitudes exceeding 3000 fT/cm in the MEG signals. The resulting data were 
then filtered by a bandpass filter from 1 to 40 Hz.  
Anatomic image data was acquired from human subjects using a GE Healthcare Signa 1.5-T Excite scanner 
(General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) with an eight-channel head coil. The imaging parameters were as follows: 
TR = 8.548 ms, TE = 1.836 ms, TI = 400 ms, flip angle = 15°, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm2, matrix 
size = 256 × 256, no gaps; to give an in-plane resolution of 1 mm2 and a slice thickness of 1.5 mm. 
BOLD (blood-oxygenation-level-dependent) signals were measured using a gradient echo-planar imaging 
(EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 3 s, TE = 50 ms, FOV = 192 mm, flip angle = 88°, 64 × 
64 matrix, 33 slices/slab, slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm, and voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm. Along the 
anterior-posterior commissural plane, a total of 128 EPI volume images were acquired. 
The subject’s head shape and position relative to the MEG sensor were measured using a three-dimensional 
digitizer and five markers. Three predetermined landmarks (nasion and bilateral preauricular points) on the 
scalp were also used to match and coregister MEG source signals on the anatomic MRI scans to ensure 
realistic source reconstruction according to the coordinate systems.  
Data analysis: BrainVoyager QX software (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) was utilized to 
localize activity areas related to visual motion in the functional imaging scans. The effects of the experimental 
paradigm were estimated on a voxel-by-voxel basis using the principles of the general linear model extended 
to allow the analysis of fMRI data as a time series. Active regions were identified and visualized on the 
anatomic MRI scans with significant values thresholded at p<0.005. These fMRI foci, corresponding to mean 
positions of major clusters, were taken as the initial values in the MEG source analysis. The equivalent current 
dipole (ECD) model in a spherical volume was used to estimate the cortical sources of the measured magnetic

mode, information was conveyed from V3A about 50–75 ms after motion onset, feedforward to V5, followed 
by feedback after a latency of 100 ms (from V5 to V3A at about 100 ms, from V5 to V1 at about 50 ms, or 
from V3A to V1 at about 25 ms). All of these interactions happened within 250 ms. In contrast, in the 
contraction mode, information was conveyed to V5 followed by feedback (similar to that for the expansion) 
all after a latency of 250 ms. Although these interactions were delayed by about 250 ms, they were completed 
within 500 ms.

Knowledge of the functional roles of brain areas and associated connections is important to understanding brain 
processing. To our knowledge, this was the first internal study to apply combined high-temporal-resolution mag-
netoencephalography and high-spatial-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. This multi-
modality technique is useful for determining whether tractographic paths actually convey functional information 
and whether the locations of magnetoencephalography dipoles have anatomic correlates. Applying our technique 
to the visual pathway indicated that fibers generated from an equivalent current dipole near the calcarine fissure 
could be successfully tracked to the lateral geniculate nucleus and corpus callosum. The obtained results indicate 
that combining different imaging techniques might open a new window for studying various lesions in the visual 
pathway.

INTRODUCTION 
Many recent studies have explored anatomical and 
functional connections in the brain [1–4]. Recent ad-
vances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods 
have given new opportunities for combining these two 
types of brain information [5–7]. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), 
which is based on anisotropic water diffusion within 
brain tissue, has an important application in anatomic 
fiber tracking. In contrast, magnetoencephalography 
(MEG) allows functional brain imaging in real time, pro-
viding an almost undistorted view of the magnetic fields 
induced by neuronal activity. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to combine these two complementary noninva-
sive approaches as detecting visual evoked dipole sources 
by MEG and q-ball tracking fibers by dMRI to facilitate 
an in-depth exploration of neuroscience mechanisms. 
This combined mapping technique is useful for deter-
mining whether tractographic paths actually convey func-
tional information and whether the locations of MEG 
dipoles have anatomic correlates. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
To check that the tracks were identified exactly, the 
conventional early visual pathway was used due to it be-
ing well understood. Human brain q-ball imaging (QBI) 
was performed in vivo by a GE Healthcare Signa 1.5-T 
Excite scanner at Taipei Veterans General Hospital using 
a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with 162 ico-
sahedral diffusion-encoding directions, matrix size = 128 
× 128, slice number = 46, voxel size = 2.0 × 2.0× 2.2 
mm3, TR/TE = 13600/91.2 ms, and bmax = 3000 s mm–2. 
For each MRI voxel, the orientation distribution function 
(ODF) was reconstructed by the Funk-Radon transforma-
tion [8]. The tracking algorithm applied in this research 
was MFACT (multiple fiber assignment by continuous 
tracking), which is similar to FACT proposed by Mori 
and van Zijl [9] but can be applied to the propagating 
fiber spread for diffusion data with a high angular resolu-
tion. Tracking terminated when the local maximum of the 
ODF was lower than 0.7 or when the diffusion direction 
in consecutive steps differed by more than 50 degrees. 
Reconstruction techniques for QBI, fiber tracking, and 
visualization were developed in-house using Borland 
C++ Builder 6 and OpenGL API. 
For the visual stimulation, a single wedge-shaped 
checkerboard pattern was presented binocularly in the 
right hemifield in an “on” and “off” mode. Subjects were 
instructed to fixate on a small red cross presented in the 
central field so as to minimize eye movements during the 
experiment whilst not performing other tasks. Visual 
evoked fields were recorded with a whole-head 
160-channel coaxial gradiometer (PQ1160C, Yokogawa 
Electric, Tokyo, Japan). One hundred epochs of 200-ms

with the study of Pascual-Leone and Walsh (2001). However, in the contraction, V5 was the first area to 
mediate information at the coincident time series in the expansion condition without any interactions (feed-
forward/feedback) within 250 ms. The connective paths went back to the early stages after 250 ms with a 
similar pattern as that in the expansion condition. According to other researches (Delon-Martin et al., 2006; 
Koyama et al., 2005), areas involved in contraction and expansion do not respond in the same way. And the 
time delay interactions could be explained as insensitivity to object motion-in-depth away from the observer.
