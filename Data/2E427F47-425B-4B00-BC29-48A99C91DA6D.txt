ABSTRACT 
In a fractured rock mass, a slope failure often happens along the discontinuities during the 
heavy rain period, which causes roads and passersby serious damage.  Because of variability in 
the parameters of geotechnical materials, a probabilistic slope stability method for evaluating the 
slope stability is desirable.  The purpose in this study is to develop a probabilistic slope stability 
approach based on the reliability theory to calculate the reliability index and the probability 
failure.  A rock wedge slope is taken as a case study. A knowledge-based clustered partitioning 
technique is developed for determining reliability index and failure probability of rock wedge.   
For checking the accuracy of the proposed approach, the reliability index computed with this 
KCP technique is compared with those using other approaches such as the Excel Solver-based 
method by Low and his colleagues.  The new technique is found proper, effective and efficient.  
Reliability analysis with this technique is then used to examine the influence of parameter 
uncertainties and correlations among the parameters on the failure probability of rock wedges.  
Significant findings are derived from the sensitivity and parametric analysis.  The findings show 
that the probability of failure of rock wedge is especially affected by the rock strength and water 
pressure and their uncertainty levels.  Furthermore, it is also important to properly evaluate the 
possible correlations among the input parameters.  Computed failure probability could be 
misleading if significant correlations exist but are not included in the reliability analysis.  The 
analysis results can be a reference for the landslide risk issue.  
Keywords：Slope; Uncertainty; Reliability index; Knowledge-based clustered partitioning.   
1. Introduction 
Variability in the parameters of geo materials has long been recognized (e.g., Harr, 1987; 
Baecher and Christian 2003).  The variability in the geotechnical parameters can lead to various 
degrees of uncertainty in the results of an engineering analysis.  Many investigators (e.g., Oka 
and Wu 1990; Christian et al. 1994) have argued that the concept of probability of failure or 
length, and (4) backtracking.  These steps are followed by the computation of the reliability 
index and probability of failure.  The KCP-based reliability method is summarized in a 
step-by-step procedure shown in Fig. 1.  
4. Results and discussions 
4.1.Stability of Rock Wedges – A Case Study with the KCP-Based Reliability Method 
As an example to verify the KCP-based reliability method, a rock wedge failure case taken 
from Hoek and Bray (1981) and Low (1997) is analyzed.  Considering the mean values only, the 
deterministic analysis yields a central factor of safety CFS = 1.324.  By applying the KCP-based 
reliability method, the reliability index and the probability of failure are determined for each of 
the four failure modes.  The results are shown in Table 1. An excellent agreement between the 
two solutions as presented in Table 1 supports the validity of the KCP-based reliability method. 
4.2.Sensitivity and Parametric Analysis 
Fig. 2 shows the relation between the change of rock strength parameters (φ , c) and the 
failure probability ( ) under the scenario of full water level.  Here, the x-axis represents the 
strength reduction factor (λ).  If λ = 1, the original mean values of 
fp
φ  and c are used for the 
analysis; similarly, one half of the original mean values of the strength parameters ( 1tanφ , 2tanφ , 
c1/γh and c2/γh ) is used for the analysis if λ = 0.5.  As shown in Fig. 1, when λ = 0.77, the 
failure probability  equals 0.5 and its corresponding CFS = 1, which suggests that the slope 
is in the critical state.  
fp
Fig. 3 shows a plot of  versus  at different λ levels.  For a given λ, the failure 
probabilityincreases as the normalized water pressure parameter  increases.  At the same 
 level, however, the failure probability also increases as the reduction factor λ decreases.  
Thus, in case that the duration of a rainfall lengthens,  will increase and λ will decrease, and 
thusly, both parameters will have an adverse effect on the stability of rock wedges.   Fig. 3 also 
shows that the failure mode of this rock wedge depends on the magnitude of the normalized water 
pressure parameter: when  < 0.8, the critical failure mode is the BiPlane mode; and when 
 ≥ 0.8, the critical failure mode is the Plane1 mode.

Fig. 4 shows the relation between CFS and  at different λ levels.  At the same λ level, 
CFS decreases as  increases regardless of the type of the critical failure mode.  Of course, at 
the same  level, CFS decreases as λ decreases.  The behaviors of rock wedge (in terms of 
either failure probability or central factor of safety) as affected by rock strength and water 
pressure observed from the results of the analysis are consistent with the principles of rock 
mechanics.

 and c) on the failure 
probability ( ) are examined. As shown in Fig. 5. the effect of fp γσ  on the resulting − fp

uncertainties can result in different probabilities of failure.  Thus, it is useful to evaluate the 
safety of rock wedge with a reliability-based method that can incorporate parameter uncertainties 
(and the model uncertainty too, if present) in the analysis.  The probability of failure derived 
from the computed reliability index can complement the traditional factor of safety for a more 
complete measure of the safety level.     
The proposed knowledge-based clustered partitioning (KCP) technique is shown to be an 
effective algorithm for searching for the design point and reliability index.  Its validity is 
demonstrated through a case study and a series of sensitivity analysis.  This KCP-based 
reliability method is especially efficient for dealing with a performance function (or limit state) 
that involves a larger number of random variables.   Greater efficiency of the KCP technique 
comes from its systematic partitioning and sampling mechanism.   
The probability of failure of rock wedge is especially affected by the rock strength and water 
pressure and their uncertainty levels.  Thus, it is essential to make a concerted effort to reduce 
the uncertainty in the estimated rock strength and water pressure parameters in the field and 
laboratory investigation.  Furthermore, it is also important to properly evaluate the possible 
correlations among the input parameters.  Computed failure probability could be misleading if 
significant correlations exist but are not included in the reliability analysis.

ABSTRACT 
 
Based on the reliability theory, liquefaction probability calculation 
involving inequality and/or equality constraints becomes a constrained 
optimization problem. The genetic algorithms (GAs) are popular 
approaches to solve constrained optimization because of their 
simplicity and ease of implementation. This paper aims to develop an 
evaluation method of liquefaction probability (PL) via GAs. The total 
226 CPT-based case histories of liquefaction and non-liquefaction are 
collected from Juang et al. (2003) to calculate the PL. The analysis 
results show the GAs model is suitable for liquefaction probability 
problem. The relation between factor of safety (FS) and PL based on 
the cases studied is obtained: PL = 1/(1 + FS9.117).  
 
KEY WORDS:  Liquefaction probability; reliability index, CPT-
based data; genetic algorithms. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Earthquake-induced soil liquefaction in loose sand layers often causes 
settlement and tilting of buildings. Structural failure caused by 
liquefaction has been observed in many earthquakes (e.g., the 1964 
Niigata, Japan earthquake, the 1995 Hyogoken-Nambu, Japan 
earthquake, the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey earthquake, and the 1999 Chi-
Chi, Taiwan earthquake) (Ishihara, 1993; Earthquake Engineering 
Research Institute, 2000; Ku et al., 2004). Many empirical methods for 
assessing liquefaction hazard have been developed based on analysis of 
case histories of liquefaction and non-liquefaction around the world. 
The probabilistic evaluation of liquefaction is desirable because many 
key influence factors and environmental statues, such as earthquake 
force, soil properties and groundwater for earthquake-induced soil 
liquefaction are variability. Several approaches based on Hasofer-Lind 
reliability method are available for evaluating liquefaction probability 
(e.g. Haldar and Tang, 1979; Juang et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2007).  In 
the Hasofer - Lind method, generally known as the advanced first order 
second moment (AFOSM) method, the reliability index RI is defined as 
the minimum distance from mean values of variables to the boundary 
of the failure region, in the vector direction of directional standard 
deviations (σ ) (Low, 1997). The AFOSM relies on a constrained 
optimization scheme to determine the reliability index involving 
inequality and/or equality constraints. In solving constrained 
optimization problems, genetic algorithms (GAs) or classical 
optimization methods have been the most popular approach, because of 
their simplicity and ease of implementation.  
The genetic algorithms methods (GAs), which are the best known 
optimization techniques, are generic search methods based on the 
mechanics of natural genetics and natural selection. GAs are 
computationally easy and provide robust optimization search in 
complex space. Most applications of GAs work well to solve the 
constraint handing optimization problems (i.g. Kalyanmoy, 2000; Sun 
et al., 2008; Nedim, 2009; Subbaraj and Rajnarayanan, 2009)  
This paper aims to develop an evaluation method of liquefaction 
probability via GAs proposed by Kalyanmoy(2000). The 226 case 
histories of liquefaction and non-liquefaction are collected from the 
document of Juang et al. (2003) to calculate the liquefaction probability. 
For checking the implementation of GAs in liquefaction probability 
evaluation, the analysis results of  GAs are also compared with the 
knowledge-based clustered partitioning method (KCPM) reported by 
Lee et al.(2007). 
 
AN OVERVIEW OF ELEMENTS RELATED TO PROPOSED 
MODELS 
 
Hasofer–Lind reliability index 
 
Low (1997) interpreted the Hasofer–Lind reliability index, RI, as the 
ratio of the size of the dispersion ellipsoid that touches the failure 
surface to the size of 1-σ dispersion ellipsoid. The solution of RI, the 
minimum distance search, is obviously an optimization problem. Low 
(1997) and Low and Tang (1997) demonstrated this solution approach 
using the Excel Solver. As noted previously, several other algorithms 
such as Lagrange's multiplier (Shinozuka, 1983), polynomial technique 
(Chowdhury and Xu, 1995) and KCPM (Lee et al., 2007) are also 
available. The Hasofer–Lind second moment reliability index RI is 
defined as (Hasofer and Lind, 1974; Ditlevsen, 1981):

7. determination of RI 
The previous steps are repeated until the number of generation is met. 
We set number of generation=500~4000 for generation evolutions. 
Finally the optimum RI can be determined. By Eq.(3), the PL is 
calculated as well. 
 
DISCRIPTIONS OF CASES 
 
The 226 CPT-based case histories are collected from the document of 
Juang et al. (2004) which includes 133 liquefied cases and 93 non-
liquefied cases. The ratio of the liquefied to the non-liquefied is 4 to 3. 
These cases come from four America earthquake events (San Fernando 
Valley earthquake in 1971, Imperial Valley earthquakes in 1979 and 
1981, and Loma Prieta Valley earthquake in 1989), one China 
earthquake event (Heicheng earthquake in 1975), and one Taiwan 
earthquake event (921 earthquakes in 1999).  In the cases, M ranges 
from 6 to 7.6; 
maxa
 ranges from 0.07 to 0.8;  
wtH  ranges form 0 to 8.5m; 
cq  ranges form 0.3 to 26.6 Mpa; sf  range form 0.4 to 557.2kPa and 
γ ranges form 1.5 to 20.5 3/ mkN .  Fig. 1 is the plot of 
sNca )( 1  versus 
5.7CRR  of 226 data. The sNca )( 1  is the clean-sand cone penetration 
resistance normalized to approximately 100 kPa and the 
5.7CRR  is the 
cyclic resistance ratio for magnitude 7.5 earthquake. As to the detail ed

ANALYSIS RESULTS 
 
Fixing the correct population size and generation number in a problem 
are important factors for proper working of GAs. In order to investigate 
the influence on the performance of GAs model by population size and 
generation number, several scenarios (set number of generation = 
500~4000, and number of population size = 10~190) are calculated and 
the results are shown in Fig.2. Here, we define error= (RI – 
RImin)/(RImax – RImin). The bubble size increases with the value of error 
in Fig.2. The proper population size and generation number are larger 
than 70 and 1500, respectively. Plots of RI against generation number 
for different population size scenarios are shown in Fig.3. Here, these 
different curves of population size approach to the minimum value of 
RI = -1.058. Notice that the result is better than RI= -1.194 by the 
KCPM. However, we have used population size= 70 and generation 
number= 2000 later analysis in this paper. 
The RI is calculated by the proposed GAs and KCPM (Lee, 2007) 
models, respectively, for the case histories are compared and shown in 
Fig.4. The results obtained from the two models are shown to agree 
well with each other, as the coefficient of correlation of the RI 
calculated with the two models is quite high (ρ=0.99). Considering that 
the two models, GAs and KCPM, are very different in their approach 
technique, the GAs model is sometime better then the KCPM, but 
sometime not. However, the GAs model is available to confirm the 
validity of RI for liquefaction. 
The reliability index RI of each cases history is calculated from the 
GAs model and the probability of liquefaction from Eq.(3). As most 
geotechnical engineers still prefer to use a factor of safety in their 
practice, it is of interest to attempt to calibrate the factor of safety (FS)
