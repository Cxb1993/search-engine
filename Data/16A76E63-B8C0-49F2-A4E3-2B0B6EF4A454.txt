nonbiofouling level for human blood plasma protein repulsion. These results also support the 
hypothesis that copolymers containing hydrophilic PEO units can greatly improve the blood 
compatibility of hydrophobic surfaces and therefore enhance the ability of protein resistance when 
surface packing (size, density, and coverage) of copolymer surfaces with bounded PEO chains are well 
designed and controlled.  
Keywords: hydrophobic-hydrophilic triblock copolymers, protein adsorption, nonfouling surface,

一、前言及文獻探討    
  To control the nonspecific protein 
adsorption onto a solid substrate coating with 
nonbiofouling interface is crucial for the design 
of biocompatible materials for biomedical 
devices that come in contact with blood.1-3 
Protein adsorption is an early event in the 
blood-material interactions. Even a small amount 
of proteins on a surface can lead to the 
propagation of unwanted biofouling reaction.1 
For example, even 10 ng/cm2 of adsorbed 
fibrinogen on the implanted devices may 
introduce a full-scale blood platelet adhesion, 
and then lead to thrombosis and embolism at the 
blood contact side of the implant devices.4 
Moreover, stability of antifouling characteristics 
is another key issue needed to be considered for 
the performance of nonbiofouling surfaces in the 
human body. 
Recently, the integration of self-assembled 
monolayers (SAMs) and surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) spectroscopy into a system has 
become a powerful platform to rapidly screen a 
large number of functional groups for their 
ability to resist the adsorption of single purified 
protein or multiple mixed proteins.5-10 This 
approach provides molecular scale insights into 
the correlation of chemical structures on surfaces 
with the adsorption of protein molecules in 
various controlled media. In general, biofouling 
surfaces with hydrophobic moieties will lead to 
the nonspecific adsorption of protein in aqueous 
buffers or cell-containing solutions.1 It is 
believed that the increase of hydrophilic moieties 
on a hydrophobic material surface can 
effectively reduce its biofouling ability due to the 
reduced hydrophobic interactions between the 
biomolecules and the hydrophobic surface. 
Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based materials are 
the most commonly used antifouling materials.11 
Many hydrophobic surfaces modified with 
PEG-based materials can greatly reduce protein 
adsorption. Several previous works proposed that 
the distribution density and chain length of PEG 
on the surfaces were two key parameters in 
determining protein repelling behavior.10-12 The 
adsorption of proteins on the surfaces are 
associated with copolymer compositions in 
single purified protein solutions to various 
hydrophobic-hydrophilic PEG-containing 
copolymers. One of the most commonly and 
widely used biocompatible PEG-based block 
surfactants is the triblock copolymer of 
poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene 
oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO, 
Pluronics).13, 14 Pluronic modified surface 
provides good stem cell preservation, while PEG 
does not, indicating molecular structure of 
Pluronics on the surface with different 
interactions and biofouling behaviors.15 
Therefore, despite the low biofouling property of 
 4 
 
thiols for 24 h to form SAMs on the gold surface, 
and the chip was rinsed in sequence with ethanol 
and water, and then dried in a stream of N2. For 
the preparation of self-assembled Plurionic 
surface, the gold-coated glass substrate modified 
with CH3-terminated SAMs was mounted in the 
SPR sensor. PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO triblock 
copolymer solution was then flowed into the 
SPR cell for 20 min, followed by flushing with 
10 mM PBS solution for 30 min to remove 
loosely adsorbed copolymers. To avoid the 
copolymer aggregation in solution during the 
self-assembly adsorption on the CH3-terminated 
SAMs, the solution concentration of 
PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO was controlled under its 
critical micelle concentration for all Pluronic 
samples. 
 
Protein Adsorption Measurements by a 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Sensor. In 
this work, a custom-built surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) biosensor based on wavelength 
interrogation with a four-channel Teflon flow 
cell was used to monitor protein adsorption on 
the coated substrates. SPR chips were attached to 
the base of the prism and optical contact was 
established using refractive index matching fluid 
(Cargille). Protein solutions of 1.0 mg/mL 
human fibrinogen, or BSA in phosphate buffer 
saline (PBS, 0.01M, pH 7.4) were delivered to 
the surfaces at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min. 
Furthermore, platelet poor plasma (PPP) solution 
containing plasma proteins was also tested on the 
coated substrates. A surface-sensitive SPR 
detector was used to monitor the protein–surface 
interactions in real time. The wavelength shift 
was used to measure the change in surface 
adsorption amount (mass per unit area). The 
calibration of the wavelength shift from SPR 
data associated with the amount of adsorbed 
protein was calculated based on the quantitative 
mathematical formalism established by 
Campbell and co-workers.19 Following the 
standard calculation for the same custom-built 
SPR system, a 1 nm wavelength shift in the SPR 
response is calibrated to be equivalent to about 
15 ng/cm2 of adsorbed proteins.19, 20 
 
三、結果與討論    
In the present work, biofouling property of 
self-assembled Pluronic PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO 
surfaces was systematically studied using SPR 
for their resistance to plasma protein adsorption. 
As shown in Figure 1, PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO 
copolymers were first physically adsorbed onto 
the SPR sensor surfaces covered by 
CH3-terminated SAMs, followed by the in situ 
evaluation of plasma protein adsorption on the 
surfaces with self-assembled Pluronic 
copolymers.

of Pluronic copolymers onto the CH3-terminated 
SAM surface followed by the in situ evaluation 
of plasma protein adsorption on the surface with 
self-assembled PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO copolymers. 
 
 
For the measurements of protein adsorption, 
Figure 2 shows a typical SPR sensorgram for the 
adsorption of Pluronic F108, followed by the in 
situ evaluation of human fibrinogen adsorption. 
In the first stage for the self-assembled Pluronic 
surface formation, the amount of copolymer 
adsorption is defined as the SPR wavelength 
 6 
 
three Pluronic copolymers, L62, L64 and F68, 
were compared, with the PPO chain length of all 
three copolymers kept constant. SPR 
measurements showed that the adsorption 
amount of these Pluronic copolymers increased 
with increasing PEO contents and CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO. 
This observation indicates the surface-bound 
PEO density on the surfaces covered with 
physically adsorbed copolymer of F68 is higher 
than that of L62 and L64. Second, the effect of 
Pluronic copolymer size on the formation of the 
adsorbed Pluronic layer was also investigated. 
Pluronic copolymers of F68, F88 and F108 with 
different molecular weights but a constant 
PEO/PPO ratio (~80/20, w/w) were used in this 
study. Figure 3 showed that the adsorption of 
copolymer F108 on the CH3-SAM surface 
approached to a nearly saturated amount at a 
very low CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO (0.1 mg/mL).

terminated SAM surfaces as a function of 
Pluronic concentration in solution 
(CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO) for five copolymers (Pluronic 
L62, L64, F68, F88, and F108) at 23 oC from 
SPR measurements. 
 
This might be due to the strong 
hydrophobic interaction between the CH3-SAM 
surface and the F108 copolymer, which is 
contributed from the high molecular weight of 
PPO blocks. This observation also indicates that 
the strong hydrophobic interaction might provide 
a driving force to form a highly well-packed 
structure of the surface-bound F108 copolymers, 
which can be supported from the following 
discussion of protein adsorption.  
 
Protein adsorption on various Pluronic 
surfaces was measured by SPR at room 
temperature (23oC). One of the major plasma 
proteins, human fibrinogen, was selected for the 
testing in this study. SPR results for the model 
protein adsorption on Plurionic surfaces with 
different macromolecular hydrophobic- 
hydrophilic structures are shown in Figure 4. We 
observed that the protein adsorption depended on 
the PEO/PPO ratio and the PEO surface density. 
In general, hydrophobic CH3-SAMs show high 
protein adsorption, especially for fibrinogen, 
with a SPR wavelength shift of about 20 nm (~ 
300 ng/cm2) at 23oC according to our previous 
study.23 There was almost no reduction of 
protein adsorption observed on Pluronic L62 
surfaces at low CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO (<0.01 mg/mL). It 
was found that the protein adsorption was lower 
for copolymers with higher PEO/PPO ratio and 
longer PEO chain due to the higher surface PEO 
coverage. For copolymer F108, which has a 
higher molecular weight than other copolymers, 
protein adsorption was extremely low (<3ng/cm2) 
when CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO was controlled above 0.01 
mg/mL. In contrast, for other copolymers, 
protein adsorption remained at a higher level 
(>20 ng/cm2) over a wide range of 
CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO. This is because the PEO chains 
can not fully cover the surfaces, leading to the 
exposure of some hydrophobic structures and

Figure 5. Adsorption of fibrinogen or BSA on 
Pluronic surfaces of F68, F88 and F108 as a 
function of surface packing density of PEO 
chains (number of chains per 100nm2) at 23oC 
from SPR measurements. 
 
In general, the packing density of 
surface-bound PEO chains on Pluronic surfaces 
increases with increasing CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO of 
copolymers in the prepared solutions.25, 26 In this 
study, SPR measurements showed that the 
amount of adsorbed proteins decreased with 
increasing ΓPEO. For the Pluronic surfaces of F68 
and F88, even those with ΓPEO approaching as 
high as 7 PEO chains per 100nm2 still lost their 
protein repulsive properties and the protein 
adsorption remained at a level above 20 ng/cm2, 
which may introduce a full-scale blood platelet 
adhesion, and then lead to thrombosis and 
embolism reaction. In contrast, it was found that 
the well-packed Pluronic F108 surfaces with 
ΓPEO above 6 PEO chains per 100nm2 were 
highly resistant to nonspecific adsorption for 
both model proteins with different sizes, near to 
nonbiofouling level, at 23oC. The significant 
improvement of the nonbiofouling property 
might be due to the higher molecular weight of 
PEO in F108, which led to an increased coverage 
of PEO chains on the surfaces. The results also 
indicate that a full coverage of PEO chains on 
the Pluronic surface with an optimized protein 
repulsive property can be obtained from the 
copolymers with PEO/PPO ratio of 80/20 (w/w), 
PEO molecular weight of 11.6 KD, and PEO 
packing density above 6 PEO chains/100nm2. 
 
Plasma Protein Adsorption on Well-packed 
Pluronic Surfaces 
Numerous reports have shown that the 
nonbiofouling property of an implant surface is 
crucial to its blood compatibility for preventing 
thrombosis and embolism from the blood 
stream.2, 3 Horbett et al. showed that the 
adsorption of plasma proteins, especially 
fibrinogen, onto a surface was a key determinant 
in the subsequent formation of blood platelet 
adhesion and activation.4 Real-time adsorption of 
human plasma proteins onto Pluronic F108 
surfaces with low packing density of 
surface-bound PEO chains (Plurionc F108-L, 
with ΓPEO of 2 PEO chains/100nm2) and high 
packing density of surface-bound PEO chains 
(Plurionc F108-H, with ΓPEO of about 8 PEO 
chains/100nm2) was monitored using SPR at the 
human body temperature, 37oC. For comparison, 
self-assembly method was also used to create 
two well-packed surfaces with CH3- and 
OEG-SAMs as references. A diluted solution 
containing 20% (v/v, in PBS) plasma proteins 
from platelet poor plasma was used in this 
measurement to reduce the effects of plasma 
viscosity in the laminar flow channel. SPR

the prepared Pluronic F108 surfaces

and stability from cyclic fibrinogen adsorption

Figure 7. Cycling adsorption of fibrinogen on the 
Pluronic F108 surface prepared by 
CPEO-b-PPO-b-PEO at 1.0 mg/mL. SPR 
measurements were operated at 23oC. A 1 nm 
wavelength shift in the SPR response is 
approximately equivalent to 15 ng/cm2 of 
adsorbed proteins.  
 
Three types of ionic salts (NaCl, KCl and 
NH4Cl) were used and their corresponding ionic 
strengths of buffer medium were adjusted by 
dissolving salts into PBS buffer (0.01 M and pH 
7.4) with the appropriate concentrations from 
0.1M to 1.0M. Figure 8 compares the amounts of 
fibrinogen that adsorbed to Pluronic F108 
surfaces at three different ionic strengths with 
cyclic tests. Human fibrinogen solutions of 1.0 
mg/mL in PBS buffer medium with various 
types of salts and ionic strengths were delivered 
in sequence to Pluronic F108 surfaces at a flow 
rate of 0.05 mL/min and at 23oC. During the 
process of SPR measurements for the flowing of 
protein solutions, the remarkable changes of SPR 
wavelength shift were mainly attributed to the 
refractive index changes of the bulk solutions 
with salts. However, the surface characteristics 
of the reversible/irreversible adsorption behavior 
of protein are crucial property needed to be 
understood for the development of the 
nonbiofouling materials. Based on the SPR 
measurements, the amount of the irreversibly 
adsorbed protein can be revealed by the 
differences between the two baselines 
established before and after protein adsorption 
for each cycle.
