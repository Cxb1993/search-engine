英文摘要 
The coverage provided by sensor networks is 
very crucial to their effectiveness. The 
maintenance of both coverage and connectivity 
arises when sensor nodes die due to battery drain 
or environmental causes. The area which was 
covered by the dead node may be left uncovered, 
which is a potential point of vulnerability in the 
field. Hence, coverage maintenance is required 
to compensate for the death of the node. Sensing 
coverage maintenance is concerned with 
providing coverage to a targeted region with 
prolonged system lifetime by utilizing redundant 
deployment of sensor nodes. Most existing 
approaches to coverage maintenance require 
knowledge of accurate location information and 
consider that communication range is twice of 
the sensing range. Since, sensor nodes are low 
powered, and short-lived, one of the main design 
challenges is to obtain long system lifetime, as 
well as maintain sufficient sensing coverage and 
reliability. Hence, we have designed coverage 
and connectivity maintenance protocols for the 
wireless sensor networks that consider sensing 
range is equal to communication range. Besides, 
we have analyzed problems of estimating 
redundant sensing areas among neighboring 
wireless sensors and the redundant nodes. We 
have developed node-scheduling schemes, 
which can reduce overall energy consumption of 
the system, therefore increasing system lifetime 
of the network.  
  
      
 Fig. 1: Communication and sensing range. 
 
      The whole network is divided into grid and 
the grid length is calculated based on the sensing 
and communication range of the node, as shown 
in Figure 2.  
 
Fig. 2: Grid length based on communication and 
sensing range of a node. 
 
     As soon as the nodes are deployed over the 
monitoring region, each node starts estimating 
its grid id from its location information. Then, 
nodes flood beacon packets with their location 
information and grid id to estimate the critical 
sensing points (CSP), disjoint transmission set 
(DTS) and selects the head nodes in each of its 
DTS. Example of finding CSP is shown in 
Figure 3. 
 
Fig. 3: Example of finding CSP. 
Taking Rc = Rs or Rc < 2Rs, distance between 
any two connecting neighbors must be ≤ Rc. 
Then we have developed algorithms how to find 
the disjoint transmission set (DTS) of any node 
of the network. An example of DTS is shown in 
Figure 4. 
 
 
Fig. 4: Example of DTS. 
 
Using the concept of CSP and DTS, we have 
developed algorithms, where the one hop 
neighbors of a dead node can move based on its 
Available Mobility Distance (AMD), which is 
defined as the maximum distance that a node can 
move without affecting existing coverage and 
connectivity and is estimated as the minimum

  Fig. 7: Example of mono-grid node scheduling. 
 
      In the mono-grid node scheduling algorithm, 
we consider the redundant node in the single grid. 
However, there still exist some redundant nodes 
between each subset whose native grids are 
different. For this reason, we implement a node 
scheduling algorithm for multi-grid. In the 
beginning, the multi-grid algorithm uses the 
location of the target vertex to find the reference 
vertices. Using the reference vertex, algorithm 
decides the native grid of the target vertex, and 
the corresponding grid number. For different 
types of target vertices, it has different number of 
corresponding grids. If minimum number of 
coverage degree of the node is more than one, 
that’s mean the sensing range of the node is fully 
covered by other nodes and therefore, that node 
is redundant, which should be turned off. An 
example of the multi-grid node scheduling is 
shown in Figure 8.

四、計畫實現成果  
       Since, the work in our project is totally 
theoretical, we have analyzed our proposed 
models through rigorous simulations and have 
compared them with the theoretical results. 
Hence, implementation of the project is mainly 
focused on to simulation results.  
A. Results of Coverage and 
Connectivity Maintenance 
      In order to evaluate performance of our 
coverage and connectivity maintenance 
algorithms, we have simulated our protocols 
using ns-2.29. In our simulations, 1000 sensors 
are deployed randomly over an area of 250m X 
250m. A multi-hop and fully connected wireless 
sensor network is considered, in which all nodes 
of the network use the IEEE 802.15.4 
CSMA-CA mechanism to access the channel. 
The simulations are setup according to IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC/PHY specification and radio 
characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 compliant 
product CC2420 along with AODV routing 
protocol and TwoRayGround propagation 
model.  
      Since, MICAz is a hardware representative 
of IEEE 802.15.4 platform for TinyOS and 
widely used today, the packet length is set as a 
constant length of 36 bytes with reference to the 
maximum packet length of MICAz specification. 
Initially, each node is assumed to have fixed
