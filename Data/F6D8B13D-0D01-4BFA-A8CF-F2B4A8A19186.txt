二、英文摘要 
Ni and nano-sized Ni3Sn4 powders were incorporated into Sn and Ag powders to form 
95.5Sn-3.5Ag-1.0Ni solders by mechanical alloying. The morphologies of IMC at Ni-doped and 
Ni3Sn4-doped solders/Cu interfaces after reflows at 240˚C were observed. (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC in 
Ni3Sn4-doped solder appeared pebble-shape, while scallop-shape (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was revealed in 
Ni-doped solder. Due to the difference in thickness of IMC, the reaction was much rapid in the 
Ni3Sn4-doped solder. By quantitative analysis, The variations of Ni concentration in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 
were evaluated. The elemental redistributions of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 were discussed and correlated to 
Ni-Cu-Sn ternary equilibrium.

at room temperature. 18 By adding various powders and high-energy ball milling, solder powders 
with specific compositions can be fabricated. Betrabet et al. used mechanical alloying to mix 
SnPb solder powder and Ni3Sn4 intermetallic compound particles together to form composite 
solders. 19 
In this study, it was aimed to investigate the detailed elemental distribution in IMC between 
nanopowders modified solders and metallized Cu layer. The difference of interfacial reaction 
between Ni-doped solder/Cu and Ni3Sn4-doped solder/Cu interfaces was studied. The elemental 
distributions in the interfacial microstructure for both Ni-doped and Ni3Sn4-doped solders was 
also evaluated with the aid of color mapping technique and quantitative analysis by the electron 
probe microanalyzer.

The interfacial morphologies of the solders and UBM were observed with a field emission 
scanning electron microscope. The compositions of phases in the solder joints and elemental 
distribution across the joint interface were quantitatively measured with an field-emission 
electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL, Tokyo) with the aid of a ZAF 
program. 19The X-ray color mapping images of the solder joints were further carried out to 
investigate the detailed elemental redistributions of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC in Ni-doped and 
Ni3Sn4-doped solders.

pure Ni element, as shown in Fig. 4. 
The average thickness of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC at the interface of Ni-doped solder/Cu was 
measured around 2.7 μm, while at the interface of Ni3Sn4-doped solder/Cu it was around 4.6 μm 
after 3 times reflow at 240oC. Because the particle size of Ni3Sn4 powders was 20～30 nm, while 
that of Ni particles was about 5μm, as shown in Fig. 1, the interfacial reaction could be much 
more rapid in the Ni3Sn4-doped case due to the enhancement in the surface area of the nano-sized 
Ni3Sn4 particles, as compared to the micro-sized pure Ni powders. 
 10
The detail variations of elemental redistribution are indicated in Figs. 6 (d), (e), (h) and (i). To 
elucidate more detailed distribution of Ni concentration, an electron nanoprobe trace was drawn 
across the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 interface of the Ni-doped solder/Cu joint. The trace started at the Cu side 
and ended in the solder side, as shown in Fig. 7 (a). Results of the composition profile are shown 
in Fig. 7 (b).  
Only one layers was found between the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC and electroplated Cu layer. It was 
detected as Cu3Sn with a thickness of 0.2~ 0.5μm in the Ni-doped solder. (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 pillar IMC 
was formed at the interface, with Cu contents from 47.5 to 52.3 at. %, and Ni contents from 0 to 
6.0 at. %, respectively. Along the trace line, the Cu contents decreased from 51.1 to 47.7 at.% at 
the base of the pillar and then increased slowly to 52.3 at.%, as exhibited in Fig. 7 (c). On the 
other hand, the Ni content declined from the maximum value, which was 5.9 at.% at the base of 
the pillar, to 0.1 at.%.  
It should be noticed that the amount of Ni maintained around 3.7 at.% in the middle of 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 pillar, while decreased to nearly zero in the terminal of pillar-type (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC, 
as indicated in Fig. 7 (d). The variation of elemental contents can also be evidenced with respect 
to Fig. 6 (c) and (e). The solubility of Ni at the terminal of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 pillar was only 0.2 at.% as 
low as that in solder. It is argued that Ni, Cu and Sn tended to form (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, while Cu and Sn 
composed Cu3Sn at the solders/Cu interface during reflow process. Most (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC 
appeared to form at the interface, whereas few (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 particles were found in solders near 
the solder/Cu interface.  
Figure (c) indicates that little amount of Ni was detected in Cu6Sn5 particles far away from

pure Sn apex. A composition, such as (Cu0.93, Ni0.07)6Sn5, which was point C in Table II, was 
observed in the middle of Cu6Sn5 pillar in Ni-doped solder. Nevertheless, IMC of thus 
composition was not found in Cu6Sn5 pillar in Ni3Sn4-doped solder, as indicated in Fig. 10 (c). Ni 
was only observed in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer in the Ni3Sn4-doped solder. Nevertheless, it appeared that 
few Ni diffused along Cu6Sn5 pillar in the Ni3Sn4-doped solder, as compared to that in the 
Ni-doped solder. During reflow process, it can be argued that nano-sized Ni3Sn4 particles in 
solders provide heterogeneous nucleation sites for (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC. Therefore, the pebble-shape 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC was formed. The addition of nano-sized Ni3Sn4 particles can alter the 
morphology and elemental redistributions of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 IMC. It seems that all Ni in 
Ni3Sn4-doped solder was retained in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer and few Ni diffused through the Cu6Sn5 
pillar. 
It should be noted that higher Ni content was detected at the root of Cu6Sn5 pillars in both 
Ni-doped and Ni3Sn4-doped solders. Ni content in (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer increased as close to the 
solder side was also demonstrated. Nevertheless, according to Figs. 7 (c) and Fig. 9 (c), it 
appeared that the distribution of Ni between the Ni-doped solder/Cu and Ni3Sn4-doped solder/Cu 
interfaces was different and no Ni was detected on the top of Cu6Sn5 pillars at both Ni-doped and 
Ni3Sn4-doped solders/Cu interfaces. That is to say, only Cu6Sn5 without Ni was formed on the top 
of Cu6Sn5 pillars, which means Cu diffused faster than Ni in both Ni-doped and Ni3Sn4-doped 
solders.
