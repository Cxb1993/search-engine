commercial products, such as traffic light, 
outdoor display, and general lighting [1-3]. 
Especially, the blue LED has attracted much 
attention in the development of white LED for 
use in lighting to replace conventional 
incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps. 
Currently, the most commonly used method to 
fabricate white LED is to utilize the blue LED 
chip coated with yellow phosphor. In order to 
achieve the applications of high-brightness white 
LEDs, it is clearly necessary to improve the 
output power of the blue LEDs since they are the 
excitation light source. GaN films are usually 
grown on sapphire substrate, because no suitable 
substrates can be used for GaN-based LEDs. Due 
to the large differences in the lattice-mismatch 
and thermal expansion between GaN films and 
sapphire substrate, a large number of threading 
dislocations (~1010 cm-2 ) are induced in the GaN 
films which can result in a significant 
degradation in brightness and anti-electrostatic 
properties of LEDs [4,5].  
 
四、文獻探討 
There are several techniques available to 
reduce the threading dislocations [6-9], epitaxial 
lateral overgrowth (ELOG) is a commonly 
employed technique. In this method, a GaN 
epilayer is first grown with a few microns in 
thickness. A SiO2 or SiNX mask is subsequently 
produced in a stripe array, followed by further 
epitaxial growth. Although ELOG technique can 
dramatically reduce the threading dislocations, 
the requirement of a complex re-growth process 
is time-consuming and easily introduced 
contamination. Recently, a single growth method 
by using patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) 
without any interruption of the growth process 
has been proposed for threading dislocation 
reduction [10-14]. Besides, the geometrical shape 
of the substrate patterns can also effectively 
enhance light scattering from GaN/PSS interface. 
On the other hand, it is well known that carriers 
tend to escape from the multiple-quantum well 
(MQW) active layer of LED into the 
confinement layers for the structure of 
conventional LEDs because of a low barrier 
height at the active-confinement interface. The 
phenomenon will lead to the reduction of the 
recombination between electrons and holes at 
MQW region and to diminish the luminescence 
efficiency of LEDs. Furthermore, high 
temperatures promote carrier loss out of the 
active region resulting in reverse leakage current. 
These problems can be overcome by growing 
carrier blocking layer located at MQW/p-GaN 
interface in LED structures. In particular, 
electron blocking layer (EBL) can effectively 
reduce electron escape out of the active region 
owing to a larger diffusion constant of electrons 
compared with holes. Such EBL creates a barrier 
in the conduction band so that there are no 
electrons directly flow into p-GaN layer. 
 
五、研究目的 
The aim of this study is the investigation of 
high-brightness blue LEDs with EBL structure 
grown on PSS. Here, we use AlGaN as EBL and 
fabricate a PSS with periodic trapezoid 
column-shaped patterns. It can be expected to 
fabricate high-brightness blue LEDs using a 
combination of PSS and EBL techniques. 
 
六、研究方法 
The PSS used in this study is fabricated by 
standard photolithography and subsequent 
inductive couple plasma (ICP) etching along the 
sapphire〈 0211 〉direction. For fabricating PSS, a 
photoresist layer is deposited by spin coater on 
top of the sapphire substrate as the mask. The 
photoresist layer is prepared to be a periodic 
column pattern, where the depth and diameter of 
column pattern are 2 and 2.8 µm, respectively. 
The column array with a spacing of 3.5 µm is 
  4
using simulative datum of XRD.  
Figure 7 shows the light output power versus 
injection current (L-I) characteristics of both 
LED samples. It can be observed that the output 
power of both LEDs is linearly increased until 
saturated and then decreased with increase of the 
injection forward current owing to the thermal 
heating effect. Under a 20 mA forward injection 
current, the output powers of PSS-EBL and CSS 
LEDs without molded by epoxy resin are 
estimated to be 6.5 and 2.1 mW, respectively. A 
209% enhancement in output power can be 
achieved in PSS-EBL LED as compared with 
that of PSS LED. In addition, the maximum 
output powers of PSS-EBL and CSS LEDs are 
estimated to be 34.6 mW at 240 mA, and 12.3 
mW at 180 mA, respectively. 
We attributed the improved EL intensity and 
output power to a combination of enhanced light 
scattering at GaN/PSS interface, the reduction in 
dislocation density (by PSS) and the better 
carrier confinement which leads to a larger 
number of electrons come back MQW and then 
increased the recombination between electrons 
and holes (by EBL). 
In summary, InGaN-based high-brightness 
blue LEDs have been fabricated using a 
combination of PSS and EBL techniques. 
Experimental results indicate that PSS-EBL LED 
have a smaller forward voltage and reverse 
leakage current, a stronger EL intensity, and a 
209% enhancement in light output power as 
compared with that of the CSS LED. The 
improvement can be attributed to the reduction in 
dislocation density, the enhancement of light 
scattering at GaN/PSS interface and the better 
carrier confinement from EBL.  
For the future prospects, GaN grown on PSS 
fabricated in this study is proven to reduce 
effectively dislocation density and achieve a high 
quality of GaN. Therefore, this PSS also can use 
to grown high quality of nitride epilayers (InGaN, 
AlGaN, AlN and InN) and to substitute the 
usually used complex ELOG technique. In 
addition, This PSS fabrication technique and 
know-how obtained in this study makes it 
possible to fabricate a various shapes of PSS. 
The various shapes of PSS will be investigated 
and utilized to grown higher quality of nitride 
epilayers. On the other hand, EBL structure has 
been proven as an effective method to improve 
output power and reverse leakage current of LED 
in this study. The further research can find an 
optimum parameter of thickness and Al mole 
ratio of EBL, which can farther reduce electron 
escape out of the active region. Using a 
combination of PSS and EBL techniques can be 
expected to explore fully applications of 
GaN-based device, such as ultraviolet (UV) LED 
and green LED.
