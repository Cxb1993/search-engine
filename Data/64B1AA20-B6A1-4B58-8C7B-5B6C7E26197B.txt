Abstract 
We are concerned with a theoretical analysis of the quantum stream cipher by Yuen 
2000 (Y-00) protocol [1]. We first treat a problem on the optimal modulation scheme 
for the quantum stream cipher, using a basic model which has no additional 
randomization scheme. In the basic model of the quantum stream cipher, the error 
performance of eavesdropper is determined by the installed signal modulation scheme 
in the system. So far, Phase Shift Keying (PSK)–based [1], Intensity Modulation 
(IM)–based [4], and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)–based [5] systems 
have been proposed. However theoretical comparison of the error performances of 
them is still remaining. Fortunately it has been clarified that the PSK-based quantum 
stream cipher exhibits better performance than the Intensity Modulation-based 
quantum stream cipher under the power constraint when the average probability of 
error of Eve is used as evaluation criteria. Therefore we compare the PSK-based, the 
QAM-based quantum stream ciphers and their modified versions by numerical 
simulation under the same constraint as the case of IM versus PSK. From this 
comparison, the best modulation among the proposed systems will be clarified. Second, 
we consider a problem on a randomization technique for the quantum stream cipher. To 
improve the security level of the quantum stream cipher by Y-00 protocol, various 
randomization techniques are applicable to the basic model of the quantum stream 
cipher. The Deliberate Error Randomization (DER) is one of such randomization 
techniques. In a quantum stream cipher with the DER scheme, error bits are 
deliberately inserted to the transmission data at the encryption process and a classical 
error correcting code is used for removing such deliberately inserted bit errors. 
Although the abstract idea has been proposed by the inventor of Y-00 [1], there is no 
detailed study on the DER. Hence we propose a concrete model of the deliberate error 
randomization in this project.

I. Basics of the quantum stream cipher system by Yuen 2000 protocol 
Yuen 2000 (Y-00) protocol [1] is one of quantum cryptographic protocols and the 
cryptosystem based on Y-00 protocol for optical fiber communications is referred to as 
a quantum stream cipher. In the basic model of a quantum stream cipher, the 
transmitter consists of a pseudorandom number generator and multilevel signal 
4 
she must use a multilevel detector like a heterodyne. Due to the effect of quantum 
noise of light and the lack of knowledge on the secret key, her obtained data contains 
the enormous numbers of error bits even if she uses an optimum quantum receiver [3]. 
Thus this system works as a cryptosystem.  
 
II. Main Results 
 
(1) Finding the optimal modulation scheme for the quantum stream cipher [P-1] 
  FIG 1 shows the typical signal constellations that are used in our comparison. In this 
comparison, we evaluated the error probability of Eve for the cases of (i) ciphertext 
only attack on Key, (ii) ciphertext only attack on Key and Data, and (iii) known 
plaintext attack by supposing that the square-root measurement is used by Eve.  We 
also evaluated the amount of the accessible information which is the maximum of the 
information leaking from Alice to Eve by using its upper bound (so-called Holevo 
bound). From these comparisons, we clarified that PSK-based quantum stream cipher 
is better than the other modulations that we treated in this comparison. Although it is 
not the optimal in the strict sense, we can conclude that at least PSK is the best 
modulation among the modulations that has been proposed so far. 
 
(2) Proposal of a new randomization technique [P-2] 
FIG 2 and 3 (in Appendix) show the quantum stream cipher that includes the 
deliberate error randomization. The transmitter of this system consists of (i) (classical) 
encoder, (ii) pseudorandom number generator, (iii) error pattern generator, (iv) two 
Deliberate Signal Randomizer (DSR), (v) switching circuit for DSRs, and (vi) optical 
PSK modulator, and the receiver consists of (i) pseudorandom number generator, (ii) 
homodyne measurement, and (iii) (classical) decoder. This system works as follows. 
[Encoding procedure] 
Let L)1()1()1( aaaA = be a binary plaintext to be transmitted from Alice to Bob. 
Each part of the plaintext is encoded into a (classical) codeword by using (23,12,7) 
Golay code. Then Alice has an encoded sequence L)3()2()1( xxxX = , where 
}1,0{)( ∈tx .Let L)3()2()1( zzzZ =  be a running key sequence generated by her 
pseudorandom number generator with the secret key K , where }1,,1,0{)( −∈ Mz t K  
and we have assumed that M  is an odd number. Thus Alice has a pair ),( )()( tt xz  in 
each time slot. To randomize each pair, Alice uses two types of deliberate signal 
randomizer, DSR-I and DSR-II. They are defined by

Therefore this error pattern generator is controlled by 22 true random bit generators. 
Let L)3()2()1( eee  denote the sequence of error patterns, where }1,0{)( ∈te . If 
0)( =te , then Alice uses DSR-I for this time slot t , and if 1)( =te , then Alice uses 
DSR-II. As a result, Alice obtains a pair ),( )()( tt xz ′′  that is randomized by DSR-I or II. 
Using this pair, optical PSK modulator emits a coherent state signal

where 0>α  and 1−=j , and where { }2/))1(1()/(),( xzzMxz +−−+= ππθ . 
  [Decoding procedure] 
Bob performs a homodyne measurement for each signal with measurement angle  
)()( )/()( tt zMz πφ = . 
According to quantum signal detection theory, this measurement process can be 
expressed by a positive operator-valued measure 
{ }1ˆd||),,(0|||:| )()()()()()()()( )()()()()()()()( ∫ =〉〈∞−∞∈∀≥〉〈〉〈 tttttttt zzzzzzzz yyyyyyyy φφφφφφφφ  
where 1ˆ is the identity operator on the signal Hilbert space, and 〉)( )(| tzyφ  is the 
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 
)( )( tzyφ  of the observable  
{ } 2/)](exp[ˆ)(exp[ˆˆ )()()( )( ttz zazaY t φφφ jj −+−= ∗ , 
where aˆ  and ∗aˆ  are the annihilation and creation operators of photon, respectively. 
Furthermore, Bob’s decision rule is given as follows: 
[rule 1] Suppose that )(tz  is an even number. Let y  be the measurement outcome. 
If ),2/[ ∞∈ αy , then the plaintext bit of this signal is 0. 
If )2/,2/( αα−∈y , then the plaintext bit of this signal is unknown.  
(ÎIt means that DSR-II was used by Alice) 
If ]2/,( α−−∞∈y , then the plaintext bit of this signal is 1. 
[rule 2] Suppose that )(tz  is an odd number. Let y  be the measurement outcome. 
If ),2/[ ∞∈ αy , then the plaintext bit of this signal is 1. 
If )2/,2/( αα−∈y , then the plaintext bit of this signal is unknown.  
(ÎIt means that DSR-II was used by Alice) 
If ]2/,( α−−∞∈y , then the plaintext bit of this signal is 0.
