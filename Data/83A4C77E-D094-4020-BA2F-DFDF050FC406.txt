to an elemental analyzer (Perkin-Elmer 2400 
CHN). 
 The supernatant of sludge after 30-min 
settling was the testing sample. Most flocs were 
removed to highlight the contribution of 
colloidal fractions in supernatant to fouling 
layer resistance. Dead-end membrane filtration 
tests on collected supernatant samples were 
conducted at 30 cm-Hg vacuum using a 
0.45-µm mixed cellulose ester membrane 
(Advantec MFS Inc., CA, USA). The 
membrane together with the fouling layer was 
carefully removed from the filtration chamber 
under fully hydrated condition for further 
processing. 
 Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) was used to 
stain the amine-reactive compounds like 
proteins and amino-sugars. Fluorescently 
labelled lectins Concanavalin A (Con A, 
Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) conjugated 
with tetramethylrhodamine were used to bind 
the α-mannopyranosyl and α-glucopyranosyl 
sugar residues. Calcofluor white (Sigma) was 
used to stain the β-linked D-glucopyranose 
polysaccharides. Since Con A can also bind 
with proteins and glycoconjugate groups 
associated with cell walls, SYTO 63 
(Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA), which 
is a cell-permeative nucleic acid stain, was 
utilized to distinguish EPS from cells. 
The SYTO 63 (20 µM) was firstly dripped 
on the membrane sample and was placed on a 
shaker table for 30 min. Next, 0.1 M sodium 
bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample to 
keep the amine group in non-protonated form; 
then, the FITC solution (10 g l-1) was added to 
the sample for 1 h at room temperature. 
Subsequently, the Con A solution (0.2 g l-1) 
was added to the sample, and incubated for 
another 30 mins. Finally, calcofluor white 
(Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was used to stain the 
β-linked D-glucopyranose polysaccharides. 
After each of the four staining stages described 
above, the sample was washed twice by 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove 
excess stain. 
 Some stained membranes were froze at 
-20°C and cut into specimens of 40-µm 
thickness using a cryomicrotome for imaging 
from side. 
Confocal laser scanning microscopy 
(CLSM; Leica TCS SP2 Confocal Spectral 
Microscope Imaging System, Gmbh, Germany) 
was employed to probe the internal structure of 
fouling layer. The fluorescence of calcofluor 
white was detected by excitation at 400 nm and 
from the emission width at 410-480 nm (blue). 
The FITC probe was detected by excitation at 
488 nm and emission 500-540 nm (green). 
Excitation at 543 nm and emission at 550-600 
nm (red) were used to detect Con A conjugates. 
The fluorescence of SYTO 63 was determined 
from excitation at 633 nm and emission at 
650-700 nm. 
 
結果與討論 
Figures 1a-d show the CLSM image 
scanned at 1 µm above the membrane surface, 
representing the first deposited layer on 
membrane surface. In this initial “compact” (as 
called by Koenders and Wakeman (1996)), the 
β-polysaccharides formed a continuous layer 
(Fig. 1a); the cells were distributed in dispersed 
form (Fig. 1b); the proteins had been 
aggregated into clusters (Fig. 1c); while the 
α-polysaccharides appeared only in some spots 
(Fig. 1d). The abundance of β-polysaccharides 
in the initial layer might be attributable to their 
neutral surface charges for minimizing the 
possible electrostatic repulsion effect. Since 
this substance forms a continuous layer, the 
permeability of b-polysaccharides may 
significantly contribute to the filtration 
resistance in this initial compact. 
Figures 2a-d show the CLSM image 
scanned at 10 µm above the membrane surface, 
representing a “developed” layer. Like those in 
initial compact, the proteins still appeared in 
clusters (Fig. 2c) and the α-polysaccharides has 
not appeared in a large amount (Fig. 2d). On 
the contrary, both the β-polysaccharides (Fig. 
2a) and the cells (Fig. 2b) were noted to 
distribute largely in clusters forms. Clearly how 
proteins were initially deposited (Fig. 1c) 
affected the subsequent packing of EPS thus 
built above (Fig. 2b). Big pores were 
noticeable in this thin layer. Hence, not as 
noted in Fig. 1, most water may flow through 
these big pores while the permeability of 
β-polysaccharide layer may not significantly 
affect the filtration resistance. 
Figure 3 shows a typical side view of 
CLSM images of microtome of fouling layer 
together with underneath membrane body of 15 
was estimated. The permeability of the fouling 
layer was 2.65x10-12 m2. 
 
結論 
This study investigated how the main 
components in excellular polymeric substances 
(EPS), polysaccharide and protein, formed 
fouling layer on a mixed cellulose ester 
membrane. Fluorescently labeled lectin 
Concanavalin A (Con A) and Calcofluor white, 
and the Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were 
used in combination with confocal laser 
scanning microscopy to quantitatively describe 
the compositional distributions of 
α-polysaccharide, β-polysaccharide, and 
protein in the formed fouling layer. This result 
is essential to the improvement of MBR fouling 
for further study. 
The CLSM study conducted was 
accomplished at University of Tokyo.
