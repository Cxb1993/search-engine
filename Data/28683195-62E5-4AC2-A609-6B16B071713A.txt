中文摘要
解像度增進技術一般可分為偏軸發光、相
移圖罩與表層成像三種。偏軸發光已屬微影機
台基本配備；表層成像製程複雜，業界接受度
不高；相移圖罩則仍有廣大之研究空間。193奈
米濕浸式微影，搭配橫電偏振光光源，為目前
顯學，將主導全球未來數年光學微影之研發。
高透射率嵌附層材料除可應用於嵌附式減
光型相移圖罩外，亦可應用為光學鄰近效應修
正用之散條，因此，其重要性無庸置疑。嵌附
層正規透射率T%~6%，高透射率通常定義
T%~15-35。
本計畫分為二部份，一為 193 奈米微影高
透射率嵌附層材料之研製；二為模擬探討應用
193 濕浸式微影光學鄰近效應修正用之散條之
性質。第二部份重點在探討散條之透射率、相
對相位差對線幅、焦深、禁止間距等之影響，
尋求散條之寬度、透射率、相對相位差之最適
化參數。探討以位於中央之單一散條為主。
以PROLITH模擬結果顯示，高透射率嵌附
層作為散條，如寬度、透射率與相位差控制得
宜，確實可改善禁止間距之焦深。嵌附層材質
組成經以美國RIT之B. W. Smith教授網站模擬

英文摘要
In general, resolution enhancement
techniques consist of three methods, off axis
illumination, phase shift mask and top surface
imaging. Off axis illumination became basic for
exposurer, top surface imaging is complicate,
hardly accepted by industry, phase shift mask still
has vast space for research. 193 nm immersion
lithography using TE polarization light is the
current hot research issue and will dominate the
global research on optical lithography in the near
future.
The high T% embedded layers, besides the
use for the embedded attenuated phase shifting
mask (EAPSM), can also use as scattering bar for
optical proximity correction, therefore, the
importance is of no doubt. The normal
transmittance T often used is 6%, high
transmittance is generally defined as 15-35%.
The investigation items in this proposal have
two parts. First part is the studies on the
fabrications of high transmittance embedded
layers in 193 nm lithography. Second part is
simulations of its application as scattering bar for
optical proximity correction of 193 nm immersion
litho. The major items of the second part are the
effects of T%, phase angle on the line width, depth
of focus and forbidden pitches, and the optimized
parameters of bar width, T% and phase angle.
Studies will focus on centered single scattering bar
mainly.
Simulation studies by PROLITH have shown
that the DOF of forbidden pitch can be improved
if width, transmittance and phase change of high
transmittance embedded layer were well
controlled. The material compositions which

III. Results and Discussion
There are many optical combinations as
shown in Table 1, and each combination has many
optical parameters needed to be tested, such as
sigma radius and sigma center (offset) for dipole,
NA for immersion (range 1.0 to 1.44),
transmittance for AttPSM, width, location,
transmittance and relative phase change for ASB.
It is impossible to test all the combinations and
parameters thoroughly and is also unrealistic to
write down all the parameters used in this brief
report. After some preliminary simulation
studies with the help of Taguchi DOE,
Combination was focused on C4 for vertical line
pattern. 3 ASB parameters needed are linewidth,
transmittance, and phase change relative to quartz
substrate. Location (position) is not a parameter
because of centered position is used for single
ASB (smaller pitch), equal distance is used for 2
or 3 ASBs (larger pitch).
Hundreds of simulations were completed, for
simplification, only two figures were reported here.
As shown in figure 2, with the addition of ASB,
DOF of forbidden pitches can certainly be
increased. The parameters used are not
optimized parameters even with the help of DOE
model L9 (4 factors, 3 levels). As mentioned
above, the total parameters used are just too many.
Linewidth of 100 nm is easy to simulate, data
obtained are more reliable. As shown in figure 3,
for linewidth of 45 nm, with the addition of ASB,
DOF can be increased for certain pitch range.
However, the data obtained may not be very
reliable. The bottom data of right hand side from
figure 3 are explained as follows, 0.65/0.20 stand
for dipole sigma center 0.6 and sigma radius 0.2,
T=20 for transmittance 20%, 30 for phase change
angle, 30*2 for 2 equally distanced ASB with 30
nm width. Besides, NA is 1.12, AttPSM is 6 %,
exposure latitude (EL) is 6%. The measurement
of DOF at pitch around 190 nm in figure 3 was
difficult to obtain and not reliable.
Process windows are too small to be practically
used. Simulation limitation of PROLITH of this
version is probably at the linewidth of 45 nm.
According to the calculations from Prof.
Smith’s website, several film compositions can
meet the required properties for one specific ASB,
but not for all ASBs, for example, SiXNYOZ.is one
of the suitable compositions. The fabrication of
SiXNYOZ films were tried, the properties are close
to calculated properties. The element analysis of
SiXNYOZ film was not yet completed so far.
IV. Conclusions
The advantage of ASB is that wider linewidth
can be used if compared to chromium SB
(transmittance=0, no phase change), however,
disadvantage of ASB is that optimization of
linewidth, transmittance and phase change is
difficult. For 32 nm technical node and beyond,
the importance of ASB is clear. Further work is
needed.
