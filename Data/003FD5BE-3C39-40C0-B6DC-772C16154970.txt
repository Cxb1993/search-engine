Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are studied extensively owing to their simple 
cell configuration, high volume energy density, short start-up time and operation 
reliability. However, the major drawbacks include high production cost, catalyst and 
methanol crossover poisoning [1-3]. This study presents a simple method for Pt-M/C 
catalyst preparation using a magnetron sputtering (MS) and metal-plasma ion 
implantation (MPII) technique. The Pt catalysts were sputtered onto a gas diffusion 
layer (GDL), followed by implanting Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo catalysts using MPII 
(accelerating voltage is 20 kV and implantation fluence is 1x1016 ions/cm2). The 
crystallinity and microstructure of the catalyst films were analyzed using x-ray 
diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electronic 
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The cell 
performance was tested using potential stat/galvano station. The results indicate that 
the membrane electrode assembly for Pt-Ni/C, Pt-Fe/C and Pt-Cr/C catalysts can 
enhance DMFC cell performance, compared with traditional Pt/C and Pt-Ru/C. The 
maximum Pt-Ni/C power density is 2.4 mW/cm2 with an open circuit voltage (OCV) 
0.334 V when tested at a methanol concentration of 1M. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
The DMFC (direct methanol fuel 
cell) is one of several low-temperature 
fuel cells including PEMFC (polymer 
electrolyte membrane fuelCell) and 
DMFC, is an environmentally friendly 
technology that has attracted 
considerable interest. However, severe 
shortcomings in the present technology 
must be overcome to make the DMFC 
more economically viable. These issues 
include the cost, and reliability.  
This study presents a novel 
technique for preparing cheaper Pt-M/C 
catalysts using a hybrid deposition 
system, which includes magnetron 
sputtering (MS) and metal-plasma ion 
implantation (MPII). This investigation 
focuses on the Pt-M alloy, crystallinity 
and structures on Pt-M/C activation to 
determine which species of transition 
metal should replace the noble Ru and 
optimum surface microstructure for 
high-efficiency DMFCs. The Pt-M alloy 
formation effects, crystallinity, surface 
particle size and the fraction of Pt0 on Pt 
anti-oxide poisoning and the 
improvement in cell performance with 
the deposition parameters are examined. 
2. Experimental Details 
A series of Pt-M/C (M indicated Cr, 
Fe, Ni, Mo) binary alloy catalysts were 
synthesized using a multi-functional 
hybrid PVD system, as presented in Fig. 
1.  This system contained a magnetron 
sputter source and a metal plasma ion 
implanter. Using a MPII source can 
solve the deposition difficulty of Ni and 
Fe resulting in permeability and 
introducing a second element into the 
Pt/C catalyst easily and accurately. The 
membrane was Nafion® 117 and the gas 
diffusion layers were a carbon-coated 
teflonized carbon cloth with a Pt-M/C 
binary catalyst, which was uniformly 
deposited onto the carbon cloth. A Pt 
angular position of Pt (220) peak 
maxima resulting from the Pt (220) peak 
isolated from the diffraction peaks of the 
supporting carbon cloths. The mean Pt 
crystal sizes grew slightly after the 
second element was implanted. The 
lattice parameters were slightly smaller 
when Cr, Fe, Mo, Ni and Ru were added, 
resulting from the atomic size 
divergence between Pt and MPII atoms, 
distorting the Pt lattice. All of the fcc 
peaks of Pt-M/C are shifted to higher 
values indicating Pt alloying with Cr, Fe 
and Ni except Mo. According to the 
substitution structure, if the solvent 
atomic size is larger than the solute 
atoms, the matrix lattice will be 
extended. The Pt lattice parameter is not 
transferred to a higher value (table 2) 
after Mo, the atomic radius is larger 
compared with Pt, implanted into the 
Pt-Mo/C catalyst. This may result in 
some non-alloyed Mo existing in the 
Pt/C.

Figure 3 presents the SEM surface 
images of porous Pt/C and Pt-M/C 
catalysts at an accelerating voltage of 20 
kV and a moderate implantation fluence 
of 1×10 16 atoms/cm2. The surface 
clusters were transformed from looser to 
porous and spherical-like as the second 
elements Cr, Fe, Mo, Ni and Ru were 
implanted. This resulted from the higher 
bombardment energy of MPII atoms and 
improved the crystallinity of Pt-M/C. 
The surface particles tended to aggregate 
and the size of the catalyst particles 
decreased from 360 nm in the Pt/C 
catalyst to 300, 330, 340, 295 and 270 
nm respectively in Pt-Cr/C, Pt-Fe/C, 
Pt-Mo/C, Pt-Ni/C, Pt-Ru/C catalyst, as 
shown in Fig 3.  Figure 4 shows the 
bright field TEM micrograph and SAD 
patterns of Pt/C catalysts and binary 
Pt–M/C catalysts, respectively. SAD 
pattern observations show that all 
Pt-based catalysts possess the Pt fcc 
structure and the intensity of diffraction 
rings with MPII treatment are stronger 
in comparison with the Pt/C catalyst. 
This means that an increase in 
crystallinity in these Pt-M/C samples 
during MPII treatment results from the 
moderate bombardment energy leading 
to reorganized atoms and grain growth. 
This is a benefit for methanol 
decomposition [5]. The results are 
consistent with the XRD measurements. 
From the bright field images a uniform 
catalyst particle distribution with a 
predominant and regular spherical shape 
can be observed in all samples with and 
without MPII treatment. But the Pt /C 
catalyst has a mean particle size of 3 nm, 
which is larger than that of Pt–Cr/C (2.5 
nm), Pt–Fe/C (2.4 nm), Pt–Ni/C (2.9 nm) 
and Pt–Ni/C (2.7 nm) except the 
Pt–Mo/C (4.5 nm). The chemical surface 
area of Pt-based catalysts can also be 
calculated using equation and the 
particle size in TEM [6]. The particle 
size and specific area results measured

78.2 eV, associated with Pt0, Pt2+ and 
Pt4+ respectively [4]. Table 3 presents 
the relative intensities of Pt0, Pt2+ and 
Pt4+ after the activation reactions, which 
were estimated from their peak surface 
area. Pt0 is the predominant species in 
all of the catalysts with high catalytic 
activity. The relative intensities of Pt0 in 
Pt/C and Pt-M/C catalysts were 52.3% 
(Pt/C), 69.3% (Pt-Cr/C), 90.3% 
(Pt-Fe/C), 86.7% (Pt-Mo/C), 92.8% 
(Pt-Ni/C) and 74.3% (Pt-Ru/C), 
increasing in all of Pt-M/C catalyst. This 
resulted from the transition metals Cr, 
Fe, and Ni, in Pt-M/C easily adsorbing 
H2O molecules. When the transition 
metal M is doped with Pt, Pt–COabs., 
which is a partial oxidation product of 
methanol on platinum, it reacts with 
M–OH and the CO was desorbed from 
Pt, preventing or reducing the formation 
of Pt-COabs.

Figure 6 plots the I-V curves and 
measured DMFC power density with 
Pt/C, Pt-Ru/C and Pt-M/C catalysts at 
methanol concentrations of 1M. At all 
methanol concentrations (1M, 2M and 
3M), the current densities and power 
densities of the DMFC with Pt-Ni/C, 
Pt-Fe/C and Pt-Cr/C catalysts exceeded 
those with the Pt/C and Pt-Ru/C catalyst 
except Pt-Mo/C. At an operating voltage 
of 0.2 V and a methanol concentration of 
1M, the DMFC based on Pt-Ni/C 
catalysts had the highest current density 
of 28 mA/cm2. In particular, the DMFC 
based on Pt-Ni/C catalyst had the 
highest power density of approximately 
2.4mW/cm2 with 1M methanol fuel. The 
cell performance, in terms of current and 
power densities, is related to the Pt load, 
the fraction of Pt0, specific area, 
crystallinity, formation Pt-M alloy and 
catalytic species. Prior spectral analyses 
and micro structural observations 
demonstrate that the catalyst crystallinity, 
extent of alloying and the fraction of Pt0 
after activity reaction increased 
significantly with the MPII treatment. 
Hence, all of the DMFCs with a Pt-M/C 
catalyst, except Pt-Mo/C, exhibited 
much better cell performance than 
DMFCs with Pt/C and Pt-Ru/C catalysts. 
However, the cell performance decline 
using Pt-Mo/C catalyst may be 
attributed to particle condensation, 
denser structure and lower specific area. 
The TEM image in Fig. 4(b) reveals 
metal particle accumulations, 
heterogeneous dispersion and a denser 
surface structure with Pt-Mo/C catalyst. 
The specific area is only 63 m2/g that 
resulting in a less activated area, 
inhibiting the poor cell performance.

1. Introduction 
 
Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films 
have been studied extensively in recent years 
because of their application as a photovoltaic 
material [1, 2]. There have been many studies and 
conjectures regarding the gas and surface processes 
leading to film production. An improved 
understanding of these processes is desired for 
improving film semiconductor quality, as well as for 
understanding basic surface and gas chemistry. It has 
become widely accepted that neutral radical species 
are responsible for most of the a-Si:H  deposition 
from discharges, and thus several groups with 
varying approaches have been studying the neutral 
radicals. It is well known that the electron impact 
excitation processes that determine the light 
emission through the subsequent radiative decay of 
electronic excited species. The pioneering work of 
SiH4 plasma revealed that the processes directly 
product SiH* and Si* excited species [3]. 
SiH4 + e → SiH* + H2 + H + e 
       → Si* + 2H2 + e 
Their radiative decays can be expressed by  
SiH* → SiH + hν (3 eV) 
Si* → Si + hν (4.9-5.1 eV) 
  Optical methods have been used to verily the 
presence of some of the individual radicals. Optical 
emission spectroscopy (OES) has been used to study 
the excited radicals SiH, Si and H [4-5]. OES 
measurement is a simple and widely utilized plasma 
diagnostic technique, but the equivalent SiH3 and 
SiH2 species are not detectable with this OES 
technique. In this paper we present results on a-Si:H 
deposition in rf discharge at 27.1 MHz fed with pure 
SiH4 gas , obtained by changing rf power.  
 
2. Experimental detail   
The experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1(a). 
The stainless-steel plasma chamber has inner 
diameter of 40 cm and a height of 30 cm. The 
diameter of the parallel-plate electrodes is 25 cm and 
they are 0.7- 3 cm apart. RF power (at 27.1 MHz) is 
applied to the upper electrode through an 
impedance-matching network.

In recent years, Hydrogenated amorphous silicon films (a-Si:H) show considerable promise for the 
fabrication of thin-film solar cells. The a-Si:H thin films have been deposited in a parallel-plate rf plasma 
reactor fed with pure SiH4. The plasma phase characterization has been performed by optical emission 
spectrometry (OES) for the analysis of the emitting species (SiH*, Si*, H*). The effect of the rf power on 
the plasma phase composition and on the film growth rate has been investigated in this research. The 
plasma diagnostics were performed simultaneously during the a-Si thin film solar cells deposition process 
using OES in order to study their correlations with thickness and property of the films. We present results 
on amorphous silicon deposition in rf discharges at 27.1 MHz and obtained by changing rf power between 
10 and 40 W. The results show the deposition rate and property of a-Si:H films as a function of SiH radical 
intensity. The OES analysis of the plasma characterization data on the growth mechanism supports a 
chemisorptions-based deposition model. After optimizing the deposition parameters, the amorphous silicon 
thin film silicon solar cell with efficiency of 7.6 % have been fabricated by high frequency plasma 
enhanced chemical vapor deposition (HF-PECVD).

rf power. A series of information has emerged by 
comparison of these profiles to the equivalent 
emission profiles. It can be observed that the 
displacement of the emission curve increased when 
the rf power increased. Fig. 4 presents the 
time-average axial emission profiles resulting from 
one electron impact dissociation of SiH4 towards 
SiH (3 eV). As one can observe this distribution is 
strongly affected by the increase of the rf power. For 
rf power of 50 W the profiles show a rather sharp 
maximum of intensity located closer to the rf 
electrode (0.8 cm) whereas a further increase of rf 
power in a relative enhancement of the production of 
excited species in the bulk of the plasma and 
consequently closer to the grounded electrode. The 
results indicate that the change of the distribution of 
electrons having enough energy to dissociate SiH4 
will certainly affect the film growth since it will 
shorten the distance between the growing film 
surface and the point where film precursors are 
initially produced. This will result in a modification 
of the relative flux of species reaching the surface, 
because of the different gas phase reactivity of each 
species, thus modifying their probability to 
participate in surface reactions. 
  Fig. 5 shows SiH emission at 414 nm during p-i-n 
thin film solar cell deposition. One can see that the 
consequence of increasing the rf power in silane 
plasma is the enhancement of the SiH intensity. The 
real time monitoring of Si, SiH and H intensities 
could be applied to the in situ control of film quality 
during the a-Si:H growth by PECVD system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5. Temporal evolution of the SiH emission 
intensity during deposited p-i-n solar cell. The 
i-layer was deposited using by different power from 
10 to 40 w. 
 
The effects of the rf power on (a) SiH emission 
intensity, (b) deposition rate of absorber i-layer and 
(c) efficiency of p-i-n thin film solar cell are shown 
in Fig. 6. It has been measured a linear increase of 
the SiH emission intensity, and hence, of the total 
electron density, as a function of rf power. The fact 
that electron density linearly increases with rf power 
has to be invoked in explaining the observed 
increase of the emitting species. Fig. 6(b) shows the 
deposition rate of a-Si i-layer as a function of rf 
power. The deposition rate increases when the rf 
power increased. The increase is consistent with the 
increase in the concentration of various active 
species in the plasma. It is observed from Fig. 6(a) 
that the deposition rate is a sensitive function of the 
intensity of the SiH intensity. Therefore, the 
intensity of the SiH peak could be used to monitor 
the deposition rate of the i-layer silicon films. Fig. 
6(c) shows the initial efficiency of the p-i-n thin film 
solar cells deposited on SnO2 coated glass substrate.
