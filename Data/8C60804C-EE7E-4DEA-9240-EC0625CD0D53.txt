power dividers. The proposed antenna system 
associated with feeding network and antenna 
elements can be integrated on a single substrate, 
offering lower fabrication and assembly cost and 
more compact size than the conventional 
solutions. A wideband antenna array with 
bandwidth from 2.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz and main 
beam pointing to 20 degrees is designed and 
measured as an example. 
 
II. Design Concept 
The structure of the proposed system is 
depicted in Fig. 1. The phase shifters are 
designed to position the main beam to a specific 
direction. The use of the diplexers is to switch 
the two arrays as frequency sweeps. Assume that 
f1 and f2 are the lowest and the highest 
frequencies of the desired band, choose  
 21 fffc =  (1) 
 ( )
2
1 c
LO
fff +=  (2) 
 ( )
2
2 c
HI
fff +=  (3) 
Such a choice makes the low- and high-bands 
of the diplexer have the same fractional 
bandwidth. The frequency response of the 
diplexer is plotted in Fig. 2. The delay lines in 
Fig.1 are designed so that the outputs of the 
diplexer are with the same phase at fc. Finally, 
the diplexers are fed using wideband power 
dividers.

CLO and CHI are similar to the responses of 
bandpass filters with center frequencies at fLO 
and fHI, respectively. The array with spacing d 
works as frequency being around fLO , and the 
array with spacing s works as frequency being 
around fHI . By introducing the diplexers, the 
deformation of the main beam due to frequency 
sweep can be relieved. 
 
III. Simulation and Measurement Results 
A. Simulation Results 
A 2.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz wideband antenna 
array with mainbeam pointing to 20 degrees is 
designed to validate the proposed concept.  
According to the equations in Section II, ?=61 
degrees, fc=3.46 GHz, fLO=2.73 GHz and 
fHI=4.73 GHz. The spacings d and s are 54.9 mm 
and 31.7 mm, respectively. The minimal spacing 
between two antenna elements is 11.6 mm, 
corresponding to 0.13λ0 at fc. Assume that the 
mutual couplings between antenna elements can 
be neglected, the simulated array factors are 
plotted in Fig. 3, and the side lobe level against 
frequency and the 3dB beamwidth against 
frequency are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that the 
main beam points to 20 degrees over 2.0 GHz to 
6.0 GHz, the 3dB beamwidth is between 22o and 
38o, and the side lobe level is larger than 10 dB 
from 2.0 GHz to 5.7 GHz. 
B. Components Design 
The substrate used is an RO4003 with 
Fig.1. Proposed System Architecture. 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Specification of the diplexer. 
insertion losses at the output ports are -6dB. The 
additional losses at 2.0 GHz and 6.0GHz are 0.5 
dB and 1.5dB, respectively, which are 
contributed by the 4-Way power divider and 
diplexers. 
Table I summaries the measured phases at the 
output ports and phase differences between 
output ports at frequencies 2.73 GHz, 3.45 GHz, 
and 4.73 GHz. The numbers in brackets 
represent the ideal value. At the column of 3.45 
GHz, the ideal phase shift between Ports Li and 
Hi can be determined by Eq. (7). It can be seen 
that the measured phase shifts agree well with 
the designed ones.

D. Antenna Array 
Figure 10 shows the radiation patterns in the 
xy-plane at different frequencies. The radiation 
patterns below 3.0 GHz deform dramatically, 
suffering from mutual couplings between 
antenna elements. 
V. Conclusions 
A new wideband planar antenna array has 
been proposed in this paper. This antenna system 
associated with feeding network and antenna 
elements can be integrated in a single substrate. 
Consequently, such a design is with low 
fabrication and assembly cost and compact size. 
So far, the prototype of the array antenna has 
been completed. Suffering from the strong 
mutual coupling between antenna elements, the 
radiation patterns below 3 GHz deform 
dramatically. The overall system will be 
improved in the future.
