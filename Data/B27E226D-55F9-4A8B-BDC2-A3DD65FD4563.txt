90-degree uniplanar synthesized coplanar waveguide (USCPW) is less than one-twentieth 
of a guided wavelength. A lumped equivalent circuit model is proposed to explain the 
complicated behavior of the synthesized line. The design concept, propagation 
characteristics, equivalent circuit model, and simulated and measured results are carefully 
studied. Based on the new synthesized coplanar waveguide, a novel miniaturized rat-race 
coupler is demonstrated. The proposed design is merely 7.2% the size of a conventional 
coupler, which is the smallest one ever reported in coplanar waveguide form using 
printed circuit board technology. The response of the miniaturized coupler is 
experimentally verified in Chapter 3. 
In Chapter 4, a novel slow-wave synthesized coplanar waveguide, namely the 
uniplanar synthesized coplanar waveguide, is investigated. Quasi-lumped coplanar 
waveguide inductors and capacitors are used in synthesizing the new slow-wave structure. 
The synthesis method, lumped equivalent circuit model, and simulated and experimental 
results are discussed. The synthesized line, featuring excellent miniaturization capabilities, 
has a moderate quality factor. The slow wave factor is 7.5, while the unloaded quality 
factor is 30-60. By utilizing the synthesized coplanar waveguide, three novel miniaturized 
coupled-line directional couplers are proposed and experimentally verified. With the help 
of even odd mode analysis, design charts are summarized for understanding of the 
developed miniaturized couplers. When compared with previous designs, the 
miniaturized couplers show comparable performance, but significantly reduced sizes. 
Additionally, they have quasi-square appearances, which are suitable for circuit 
integration in cascade connection. 
A novel miniaturized dual-mode ring bandpass filter is proposed in Chapter 5. The 
miniaturization is accomplished by slow-wave synthesized microstrip lines in an 
asymmetrical form. At the input/output ports, two saw-toothed coupling structures with 
quarter-wavelength open-circuited stubs are used to provide tight coupling. The 
configuration, modulation scheme, and system performance of the front-end module are 
discussed thoroughly. The tradeoff for increasing the data rate is discussed at the end of 
this chapter as well. 
In the final chapter, Chapter 8, we will conclude this project with a summary. 
 
1.2  Self evaluation 
In this project, six international SCI papers in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and 
Propagation [J-1], IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques [J-2], IEEE 
Microwave and Wireless Components letters [J-3]-[J-4], Electronic Letters [J-5], and 
Progress In Electromagnetics Research [J-6] were published. Three conference papers 
were presented in 2008/2010 IEEE MTT International Microwave Symposiums (IMSs) 
[C-1]-[C-3]. Two additional journal papers are currently under review by IEEE 
Microwave and Wireless Components letters and IEEE Transactions on Microwave 
Theory and Techniques [J-7]-[J-8]. Seven graduate students, receiving their master 
degrees within these two years, were involved in this project. The achievement of this 
two-year project is fruitful. 
By utilizing quasi-lumped elements fabricated on double-layer or six-layer printed 
circuit board fabrication process, novel artificial transmission lines in microstrip, stripline 
and coplanar waveguide (CPW) forms have been developed and investigated thoroughly. 
The new designs are applied to the development of miniaturized quadrature hybrid 
couplers, rat-race couplers, backward/forward-wave directional coupler, Marchand baluns, 
six-port junction, dual-mode ring bandpass filters, CPS-to-microstrip transition, and etc. 
All designs give rise to very compact sizes, which are commonly less than one-half the 
sizes of the second smallest ones ever reported in literature using printed circuit board 
technology. At the meantime, an impulse-radio-based RF front-end module for 
ultra-wideband communication was developed in this project, as well. By utilizing the 
Chapter 2  A Miniaturized Multilayer Marchand 
Balun Using Coupled Artificial Transmission Lines 
2.1  Introduction 
Recently, the ever increasing demands for miniaturized microwave components 
have imposed new design challenges to circuit engineers. The Marchand balun, a core 
component in microwave circuits with balanced signals, generally occupies a bulky size 
owing to the two quarter-wavelength coupled lines. Various advanced designs have been 
proposed in the literatures [2.1]-[2.7]. 
The goal of this chapter is to develop a new miniaturized Marchand balun using 
multilayer printed circuit board fabrication process. By utilizing two coupled artificial 
transmission lines (ATLs), the proposed balun demonstrates a very compact size of 0.218 
ǘ 0.44 g2. The artificial transmission line used is a modification of the design in 
[2.8]-[2.9]. As compared with a conventional stripline structure, the required physical 
length of an artificial line can be substantially reduced whereas its electrical properties 
remain the same. In Section 2.2, the circuit configuration of the novel miniaturized balun 
is introduced. By means of the even odd mode analysis, the coupled artificial line is 
investigated in detail in Section 2.3. The simulated and experimental results are discussed 
in Section 2.4. A comparison between the proposed design and previous works is 
tabulated as well. This chapter is concluded with a brief summary in Section 2.5. 
 
2.2  Circuit configuration 
Figure 2.1 illustrates the circuit layout of the miniaturized Marchand balun. The 
balun was fabricated on a six-layer printed circuit board with Rogers RO4003C substrates. 
compensated line is physically realized by an artificial transmission line using the 
synthesis procedure given in [2.8]-[2.9]. A post-integration tuning process is inevitably 
necessary to account for the parasitic coupling. According to the simulation, the 
compensated line has a characteristic impedance of 45 ohms and a phase delay of 40 
degrees at the center operating frequency. Three stripline-to-conductor-backed coplanar 
waveguide transitions are connected to the input/output ports for measuring purpose. In a 
back-to-back configuration, the insertion loss of the transition is less than 1 dB over the 
band of concern. The vias around the ports are used to suppress higher order modes. 
Although not shown in Fig. 2.1, the Marchand balun is surrounded by a row of vias to 
prevent potential exterior interference during measurement. 
 
2.3  Analysis of the coupled artificial line section 
The electrical parameters of a coupled artificial transmission line can be analyzed 
with the help of even odd mode analysis. The plane of symmetry lies in the middle plane 
between metal layers M3 and M4. In the analysis, it can be replaced by either a magnetic 
or an electric wall, which corresponds to the even and odd modes, respectively, of the 
coupled line section. The simulated two-port S-parameters of both modes can be readily 
achieved and converted into ABCD matrices with a system impedance Z0. Meanwhile, 
the ABCD matrix of an ideal lossless transmission line with a physical length L is well 
known [2.10, chap 4]. It is therefore routine to verify that the even- and odd-mode 
propagation constants and characteristic impedances of the coupled artificial line can be 
easily derived by equating each entry in the ABCD matrices representing the even- and 
odd-mode circuits to the corresponding entry in the ABCD matrix for an ideal lossless 
transmission line. Table I summarizes the calculated electrical parameters of the coupled 
artificial line used in the proposed balun. The simulator is Ansoft HFSS 10.1. Although 
the losses are taken into account in the full-wave simulation, for simplicity they have 
component in the coupled artificial lines becomes apparent and eventually deteriorates 
the balanced response for frequencies beyond 3 GHz. As compared with previous works, 
the proposed balun has the smallest occupied size. In addition, it features excellent 
in-band amplitude and phase balance, and a comparable 10 dB return loss bandwidth. The 
superiority of the proposed design over previous works is clearly verified. 
The dimensions of the proposed miniaturized balun were determined using Ansoft 
HFSS. In the simulation the conductors were modeled by infinitely thin perfect 
conductors due to insufficient computing resource. The parameters associated with the 
coupled line sections are lATL = 4.3, ll1 = 1.6, ll2 = 0.5, ll3 = 1.225, lc1 = 1.15, lc2 = 1, wC1 = 
0.6, wd = 0.2, and gd = 0.2. The parameters related to the compensated line are lcomp = 4, ll4 
= 1.6, lc3 = 2, lc4 = 1.4, wC2 = 1.6, and wC3 = 0.4. The feeding structure has dimensions of 
lcpw = 1.15, wcpw = 1.2, and ls = 0.65. All units are in millimeters. The widths of both line 
inductors and interdigital fingers are 0.2 mm. The spacing between the fingers is 0.2 mm 
as well. The balun features a very compact size of 18.725 ǘ 3.8 mm2, or equivalently, 
0.218 ǘ 0.044 g2. Here g is referred to as the guided wavelength of a 50 ohm stripline in 
the same substrate. 
Figure 2.3 illustrates the simulated and measured S-parameters of the Marchand 
balun at all ports. The simulation was completed by HFSS while the measurement was 
performed using an Agilent performance network analyzer E8362B along with a probe 
station. The 40A-GSG-400-DP-W probe heads from Picoprobe® are used for 
measurement. A full two-port SOLT calibration was carried out to shift the reference 
planes to the probe tips. During the measurement the non-contacted ports are terminated 
by two 100 ohm chip resistors in parallel for impedance matching. The measured 10 dB 
return loss (RL) bandwidth is 1.43 – 2.58 GHz, i.e., a fractional bandwidth of 60 %. The 
maximum return loss is 24.5 dB, and the minimum insertion loss is 3.4 dB. The insertion 
loss deviates from the ideal value only by 0.4 dB. The measured amplitude and phase

Chapter 3  Novel Uniplanar Synthesized Coplanar 
Waveguide and the Application to Miniaturized 
Rat-race Coupler 
3.1  Introduction 
The coplanar waveguide (CPW), which was first introduced in 1969, has become 
one of the most reliable planar transmission lines in microwave and millimeter wave 
applications. The coplanar waveguide features a simple fabrication process with scalable 
dimensions, wide attainable characteristic impedances, and realizable series/shunt stubs. 
The surface mounted devices can be easily mounted on a coplanar waveguide as well.  
Recently, due to the urgent demands of highly integrated systems, circuit 
miniaturization with slow-wave synthesized or artificial transmission lines has drawn 
intensive attention in the microwave community. Miniaturized microwave components 
can improve the utilization of resources and reduce the fabrication cost. Many researchers 
have been devoted themselves to investigating the miniaturization techniques for 
transmission lines [3.1]-[3.6]. In [3.1], periodic loaded stubs were applied to develop 
artificial transmission lines in microstrip form. The LC ladder network [3.2] and the 
complementary-conducting-strip (CCS) [3.3] are the common ways to realize synthesized 
lines in MMIC process. Artificial transmission lines based on quasi-lumped microstrip 
inductors and capacitors were introduced and studied in [3.4]. Synthesized transmission 
lines in coplanar waveguide form have been realized by series and shunt stubs in 
[3.5]-[3.6]. 
In this subproject, a novel synthesized coplanar waveguide, namely the uniplanar 
synthesized coplanar waveguide (USCPW), is proposed and investigated. The new design, 
which is composed of quasi-lumped meander line inductors and interdigital capacitors in 
50-ohm coplanar waveguides are attached to each side of the unit cell for phase 
adjustment between the actual phase of the unit cell and the targeted value. 
To simplify the analysis, the lumped equivalent circuit model in Fig. 3.2 can be 
rearranged as a simple L-section with an equivalent series inductance Ls and a 
shunt-to-ground capacitance Cp, where 
                       2 2s ul ucL L L                          (3.1) 
and         2 8 .p uc ulC C C                        (3.2) 
With (1) and (2), the characteristic impedance Zc and guided wavenumber g of the 
unit cell can be derived by [3.4] 
/c s pZ L C                        (3.3) 
and         8/ .g s p uL C l                        (3.4) 
Here, lu8 is the physical length of the unit cell. It is routine to verify that as Ls and Cp 
rise proportionally, the guided wavenumber in (3.4) can be dramatically raised whereas 
the characteristic impedance in (3.3) keeps unchanged. The required physical length of 
the synthesized coplanar waveguide is, in turn, significantly reduced. On the other hand, 
the electrical properties of the synthesized line remain principally the same as its 
conventional counterpart. The approximate equations (3.1)-(3.4) provide very accurate 
results as long as the unit cell is electrically small when compared with the guided 
wavelength. 
The 50-ohm 90-degree unit cell was designed on a 0.508-mm RO4003C substrate. 
The relative dielectric constant is 3.55 and the loss tangent is 0.0027. Air bridges are 
attached to suppress the unwanted slotline mode. At the center frequency, 915 MHz, the 
occupied area of the unit cell is merely 10.6 mmġ× 12.75 mm, or equivalently, 0.041 gġ× 
0.05 g. Here g is referred to as the guided wavelength of a 50-ohm coplanar waveguide 
on the same substrate at 915 MHz. The dimensions of the unit cell are wcpw = 3 mm, scpw 
circuit model are therefore verified. 
By applying the same design procedure, an additional 90-degree uniplanar 
synthesized coplanar waveguide (USCPW) was designed, simulated and measured, as 
shown in the inset of Fig. 3.4. The characteristic impedance is 70.7 ohms at 915 MHz. 
The dimension of the 70-ohm unit cell is 0.043 gġ × 0.043 g. The simulated and 
measured characteristic impedances and phase delays are shown in Fig. 3.4. Excellent 
agreement between the results is observed as well. At 915 MHz, the measured 
characteristic impedance and phase delay are 73.1 ohms and -89.9 degrees, respectively. 
The slow wave factors of the unit cells reach up to 7.5, while the quality factors are 
around 30. The 70-ohm unit cell will be applied to the miniaturized rat-race coupler in the 
following section.
 
3.3  Miniaturized Rat-race Coupler 
To demonstrate the miniaturization capability of the proposed uniplanar synthesized 
coplanar waveguide (USCPW), a novel miniaturized rat-race coupler was developed and 
experimentally verified on a 0.508-mm RO4003C substrate. The center frequency is 915 
MHz. The design procedure is simple. By replacing the conventional 90-degree 
transmission lines in a rat-race coupler with the 70-ohm uniplanar synthesized coplanar 
waveguides (USCPWs), a miniaturized rat-race coupler can be readily achieved. The 
circuit layout is illustrated in Fig. 3.5, which is a directly scaled version of the developed 
coupler. Additional air bridges are applied to suppress the higher order modes. In the 
proposed design, the 3g/4 line is realized by three cascaded 70-ohm unit cells. To 
minimize the occupied area, the three cascaded unit cells for the 3g/4 line are arranged in 
parallel with the remaining three synthesized unit cells. All unit cells are in the same form, 
and their electrical lengths are a little bit less than 90 degrees to account for the 
interconnection effects. The ports are inserted in-between the unit cells, and two 
3.4  Conclusion 
By utilizing quasi-lumped coplanar waveguide components, a novel slow-wave 
synthesized coplanar waveguide, namely the uniplanar synthesized coplanar waveguide 
(USCPW), has been proposed and investigated in this paper. The occupied size of a 
90-degree unit cell is merely 0.002 g2. A lumped equivalent circuit model, which is 
capable of explaining the complicated behavior of the uniplanar synthesized coplanar 
waveguide (USCPW), has been proposed and discussed. The lumped equivalents are 
given as well. Based on the new synthesized coplanar waveguide, a novel uniplanar 
miniaturized rat-race coupler has been developed and experimentally verified. The 
proposed coupler is merely 7.2% the size of a conventional design. The circuit response, 
on the other hand, is comparable to the conventional one. To the authors’ knowledge, the 
proposed rat-race coupler is the smallest design in coplanar waveguide form using printed 
circuit board technology. The promising potential of the proposed uniplanar synthesized 
coplanar waveguide (USPCW) for circuit miniaturization is clearly unveiled.

Chapter 4  Miniaturized Coupled-line Couplers 
Using Uniplanar Synthesized Coplanar Waveguides 
4.1  Introduction 
Passive microwave components, principally developed by transmission lines, are 
large in size and have become the major bottleneck in realizing highly integrated systems. 
To tackle this problem, slow-wave artificial transmission lines have drawn a great deal of 
attention in the microwave community, because of their capability of miniaturization and 
cost reduction. In literature, the artificial transmission line is also known as the 
synthesized transmission line. Investigations on the miniaturizations of transmission lines, 
based on slow wave structures, have been found in [4.1]-[4.8]. When compared with 
other size reduction techniques [4.9]-[4.11], the slow-wave artificial transmission line 
provides a simple and systematic way to synthesize miniaturized components without the 
need of surface mounted devices, via holes, or photonic bandgap structures. 
Meanwhile, the coupled-line couplers, an important building block in microwave 
systems, have been investigated intensively in past decades [4.12]. Advanced directional 
couplers in CPW form have been reported in both edge-coupled and broadside-coupled 
configurations. Edge-coupled CPW couplers with interdigital capacitor loading, floating 
finite-extent backed conductor, and composite right/left-handed lines have been reported 
in [4.7], [4.13], and [4.14], respectively. Broadside-coupled CPW couplers with defected 
ground structure, dielectric overlay, and hexagonal slot were investigated in [4.15]-[4.17]. 
These advanced designs are capable of improving the coupling strength, reducing the 
occupied size, or widening the operating bandwidth. Nevertheless, except for [4.7], the 
physical lengths of the previously reported couplers are all one-quarter wavelength long. 
This is unacceptable in modern applications and further miniaturization is required. 
other hand, remain almost unaltered. The design methodology, even odd mode analysis, 
design charts, and experimental results will be investigated thoroughly. 
 
4.2  Uniplanar Synthesized Coplanar Waveguide 
A. Circuit Configuration and Synthesis Procedure 
The circuit layout and equivalent lumped circuit model of the uniplanar synthesized 
coplanar waveguide are shown in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Here, a 50-ohm 
90-degree synthesized line, which will be referred to as a unit cell in the following 
discussion, is demonstrated as an example.  
As shown in Fig. 4.1, the meander line inductors for replacing the series inductance 
in a conventional CPW are arranged symmetrically, with respect to the center of the unit 
cell. In the first order approximation, each of the meander line inductors can be 
represented by a network consisting of a series lumped inductor Lul and four parasitic 
shunt capacitors Cul, as indicated in Fig. 4.2. The interdigital capacitors on each side of 
the meander line inductors can be summed up as a shunt capacitor Cuc. Two series 
lumped inductors Luc are then added to the model to account for the additional current 
paths flowing through the connection lines of the interdigital capacitors. The short 
conventional 50-ohm CPWs on each side of the unit cell are used for phase adjustment 
between the actual phase of the unit cell and the targeted value.  
The lumped circuit model in Fig. 4.2 is too difficult to analyze directly due to the 
complicated interconnections. To simplify the analysis, the circuit model can be 
approximately rearranged as a simple L-section with an equivalent per-unit-cell series 
inductance Ls and per-unit-cell shunt-to-ground capacitance Cp, where 
         2 2s ul ucL L L                          (4.1) 
and        2 8p uc ulC C C  .                       (4.2) 
                            8g ul  .                        (4.5) 
By repeating the extraction procedure, a set of design curves versus the dimensions of the 
meander line inductors and interdigital capacitors could be retrieved. This, in turn, helps 
determine the dimensions of a unit cell with specific electrical properties. A 
post-integration tuning process might be required to account for the parasitic coupling 
effects of the closely arranged quasi-lumped elements. These design curves are easy to 
build and similar to Fig. 4.2 in [4.4]. They will not be repeated for brevity. 
B. Experimental Results and Discussion 
The 50-ohm 90-degree unit cell was developed on a 0.508-mm RO4003C substrate. 
The relative dielectric constant is 3.55 and the loss tangent is 0.0027. Air bridges are used 
to suppress the unwanted slotline mode. For easy mounting of SMA adapters, two 
additional 5-mm CPWs are connected to each side of the unit cell. The additional lines 
are de-embedded using the Thru-Reflect-Line (TRL) calibration technique in the 
measurement. The dimensions of the unit cell are summarized in Table I for easy 
reference. The subscript “u” represents the parameters associated with the unit cells. At a 
center frequency of 915 MHz, the occupied size of the unit cell, including the 
finite-extent ground plane, is merely 10.6 mmġ× 12.75 mm, or equivalently, 0.041 g × 
0.05 g. It is only one-sixth the length of a conventional CPW with the same electric 
length. Here, g is the guided wavelength of a 50-ohm CPW on the same substrate at 915 
MHz. The finite-extent ground plane, whose width is set equal to that of the signal trace 
of a 50-ohm CPW, accounts for the return current path on the ground plane. 
The simulated, measured, and calculated S-parameters of the unit cell are shown in 
Fig. 4.3(a). The full-wave simulation was carried out by the Ansoft HFSS, while the 
measurement was taken by an Agilent E8363B network analyzer. The calculation, on the 
other side, was completed by the Agilent ADS, using the equivalent circuit model in Fig. 
4.2. The extracted element values are Lul = 5.58 nH, Cul = 0.095 pF, Cuc = 1.73 pF, and Luc 
Two additional 90-degree unit cells were obtained using the same synthesis 
procedure. At 915 MHz, the characteristic impedances of the additional cells are 35.4 and 
70.7 ohms. The geometric parameters are also summarized in Table I. The sizes of the 
35-ohm and 70-ohm unit cells are 0.042 g × 0.06 g and 0.043 g × 0.043 g, respectively. 
For the 35-ohm synthesized line, the meander line inductors are replaced by straight line 
inductors, as the required series inductance is relatively low.  
The attenuation constants, g, and guided wavenumbers, g, of the 35-, 50-, and 
70-ohm unit cells can be determined by [4.18]

In Fig. 4.5, the normalized attenuation constants, (dB/g), and normalized guided 
wavenumbers, (g/k0), of the unit cells are compared to those of a conventional 50-ohm 
CPW. The results are simulated by Ansoft HFSS. The normalized guided wavenumber 
(g/k0) is known as the slow wave factor of a transmission line. At the center frequency, 
the slow wave factors of the synthesized lines are 7.5, five times higher than that of a 
conventional CPW.  
The attenuation constant in Fig. 4.5, on the other side, is normalized by the guided 
wavelength. This represents the power dissipated by a transmission line in one guided 
wavelength. The power dissipation of the synthesized line, though higher than that of a 
conventional CPW, is still in an acceptable range if its promising miniaturization 
capability is simultaneously taken into consideration. The unloaded quality factors, 
g/2
g, show similar results. At the center frequency, the unloaded quality factors of the 
35-, 50-, and 70-ohm unit cells are 66, 31 and 27, respectively; this is good enough for 
components developed for circuit miniaturization.

To determine the even/odd-mode electrical parameters, including the characteristic 
impedances, effective dielectric constants, coupling coefficient, and lumped equivalents, 
the synthesized edge coupler is first treated as a full four-port network in a full-wave 
simulator. The simulated four-port S-parameters are then imported into the Agilent ADS. 
With the excitation arrangements shown in Fig. 4.7, the even odd mode analysis is 
completed, and the four-port S-parameters are converted into a pair of two-port 
S-parameters representing the even- and odd-mode half circuits. By substituting the 
two-port S-parameters into (4.6), the impedances Zi can be derived by

A miniaturized 10-dB edge coupler was developed as a demonstration. The design 
begins with two uncoupled 50-ohm synthesized lines. From the design charts, the initial 
lengths of the interdigital fingers are leo = 2.5 mm and lee = 4 mm, which corresponds to a 
coupling coefficient of 9.75 dB. A post-integration iterative process is required to 
minimize the parasitic coupling between the connecting lines, to optimize the impedance 
matching, as well as to adjust the overall electrical length. The final dimensions are leo = 
2.6 mm and lee = 4.1 mm. The dimensions of the unit cells are: lu1 = 0.45 mm, lu2 = 0.2 
mm, lu3 = 0.6 mm, lu4 = 0 mm, lu5 = 0.4 mm, lu6 = 0.25 mm, wu1 = 0.2 mm, wu3 = 1.6 mm, 
wu4 = 0.5 mm, wu5 = 0.4 mm, le1 = 11 mm, le2 = 1.1 mm, and we1 = 16.2 mm. The 
geometric parameters associated with the interconnections are le3 = 13 mm, we2 = 9.2 mm 
andġe1 = 106.5°. The subscript “e” represents the parameters associated with the edge 
coupler. The calculated even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances are 73 and 37.1 
ohms, while the even- and odd-mode guided wavenumbers are 144.6 and 158 rad/m, 
respectively, at the center frequency. The extracted lumped equivalents using (4.19)-(4.22) 
are Ls = 7.854 nH, Cp = 1.898 pF, Lm = 2.246 nH, and Cm = 1.089 pF.  
The occupied size of the synthesized edge coupler, including the finite-extent 
ground plane, is 11 mm × 19.2 mm, or equivalently, 0.043 g × 0.075 g. Instead of a long 
between the lines. Four conductor-backed coplanar waveguides are used to connect the 
coupled synthesized lines to SMA adapters. Additional bond wires can suppress the 
higher order modes. The vias around the coupler keep the ground planes in equal 
potential. 
With the same extraction procedure, the design charts for the synthesized broadside 
coupler are shown in Fig. 4.11. The coupled lines are investigated in terms of two 
variables, lbo and lbe. The length, lbo, determines the mutual capacitances between the 
synthesized lines on the top and bottom layers. This, in turn, controls the odd-mode 
characteristic impedance and effective dielectric constant. On the other hand, the 
even-mode parameters are adjusted by the length, lbe, which determines the 
shunt-to-ground capacitances of the lines. Differing from the edge-coupled coupler, here 
lbo also affects the even-mode effective dielectric constant, whereas lbe has a negligible 
effect on the odd-mode parameters. 
Based on the even-/odd-mode characteristic impedances, Fig. 4.11(c) shows the 
calculated coupling coefficient of the synthesized broadside coupler. The maximum 
attainable coupling is around 3.2 dB, significantly larger than that achieved by the edge 
coupler. The maximum achievable coupling coefficient is principally limited by the 
degraded directivity when the difference between the even- and odd-mode phase 
velocities becomes large. This can be observed when lbo > 5 mm and lbe < 0.6 mm. For 
tighter coupling, e.g. a coupling coefficient greater than 3 dB, the substrate could be 
replaced by one with thinner thickness or higher dielectric constant. Additionally, since 
the broadside coupler is fully symmetric with respect to the middle plane of the substrate, 
the design charts in Fig. 4.11 are expected to have better accuracy than those in Fig. 4.8. 
For demonstration purpose, a miniaturized 6-dB broadside coupler was developed 
and experimentally verified. The initial dimensions of the interdigital fingers from the 
design charts are lbo = 3 mm and lbe = 1.6 mm. To compensate for the parasitic coupling 
comparison of the performances of the miniaturized broadside coupler and the design in 
[4.15] is shown in Table III. Although the coupler in [4.15] shows a very wide operation 
bandwidth and negligible in-band loss, it is 5.8 times the size of a conventional CPW 
design. 
C. 3-dB forward-wave edge-coupled coupler 
The last example is a 3-dB forward-wave edge-coupled directional coupler. A 
conventional forward-wave coupler generally requires a coupling length of several 
wavelengths. An alternative approach, resulting in compact size, was presented in [4.19] 
with microstrip technology. In this approach, the requirement of S11e = S11o = 0 for a 3-dB 
forward-wave directional coupler is satisfied with 
                          0 0eZ Z                          (4.23) 
             and  2o el l    ,                       (4.24) 
where l is the coupling length of the coupler. With (4.23) and (4.24), the coupler is 
perfectly matched and isolated, respectively, at ports 1 and 3 at the center frequency. 
Meanwhile, at ports 2 and 4, the input power is equally split and the phases are in 
quadrature, 
                  21 ( 1 ) 2S j   ,                    (4.25)

This alternate forward-wave coupler is inherently a narrowband design. 
Fig. 4.13 shows the circuit layout of the miniaturized 3-dB forward-wave directional 
coupler using uniplanar synthesized coplanar waveguides. The proposed design adopts an 
edge-coupled configuration, as well. To satisfy the criterion (4.23), the even-mode 
characteristic impedance,  
                    0 / ( ) /e e e s m pZ L C L L C   ,              (4.27) 
should be lowered down by replacing the meander line inductors by straight line ones to 
measured |S21| and |S41| are both -3.6 dB. The phase difference between the output ports is 
90.1°. The additional loss at the output ports can also be attributed to the extra long 
fingers. The forward-wave coupler is narrowband, as expected. From 909 to 942 MHz, 
i.e., a fractional bandwidth of 3.6%, the miniaturized coupler meets the following 
specifications: the variation of coupling coefficient C < 1 dB, the phase imbalance < 2 
degrees, and the return loss and isolation > 15 dB. Table IV compares the performances 
of the miniaturized forward-wave coupler with those of the design in [4.19]. The 
proposed coupler features a more compact size, at the expanse of a narrower bandwidth 
and slightly higher in-band power dissipation. 
 
4.4  Conclusion 
A novel slow-wave synthesized coplanar waveguide, namely the uniplanar 
synthesized coplanar waveguide, has been proposed and comprehensively discussed in 
this paper. The unit cell is realized by direct integration of quasi-lumped coplanar 
waveguide components. It features outstanding size reduction capability with a moderate 
quality factor. The physical length of a 90-degree synthesized line is less than 
one-twentieth of a guided wavelength. 
By utilizing the uniplanar synthesized coplanar waveguides, three miniaturized 
CPW directional couplers with coupling coefficients of 3, 6, and 10 dB have been 
designed and experimentally verified. Benefitting from the synthesized coplanar 
waveguides, the proposed directional couplers feature remarkable reductions in both sizes 
and coupling lengths. The proposed backward-wave couplers are only one-third the size 
of the conventional designs. To the authors’ knowledge, the miniaturized couplers are the 
smallest designs ever reported using printed circuit board technology. The electrical 
properties, on the other hand, are comparable to those in literature. The proposed 
miniaturized couplers are especially suitable for circuit integration, owing to their

Chapter 5  A Miniaturized Dual-mode Ring 
Bandpass Filter 
5.1  Introduction 
Microwave bandpass filters are indispensable components in the RF front-ends of 
modern wireless communication systems. Among the filter designs, the dual-mode ring 
bandpass filter based on the ring resonator is simple in configuration and easy to build, 
and is especially suitable for narrowband applications [5.1]. Advanced compact 
dual-mode ring bandpass filters have been reported in [5.2]-[5.5]. In this letter, we 
investigate a novel dual-mode bandpass filter, having a very compact size using the ring 
topology. The design is accomplished by utilizing the slow-wave synthesized microstrip 
lines in [5.6] in an asymmetrical form to miniaturize the area of the ring resonator. By 
utilizing the LC tanks in the synthesized microstrip lines and the additional 
open-circuited stubs in the saw-toothed coupling structures, multiple transmission zeros 
can be created and individually controlled in the upper stopband. The proposed filter 
shows good signal attenuations at the second (2f0), third (3f0) and fourth (4f0) harmonics 
of the passband frequency (f0). 
 
5.2  Miniaturized Dual-mode Ring Bandpass Filter 
The synthesized microstrip line in Fig. 5.1(a) is the basic building block in realizing the 
miniaturized dual-mode ring bandpass filter. It is composed of quasi-lumped microstrip 
meander line inductors, parallel plate capacitors, and an interdigital capacitor. The 
synthesis procedure, including the determination of the characteristic impedance and 
electrical length of the line, the extraction of the value of each individual quasi-lumped 
element, the control of the transmission zero generated by the LC tank, and etc. have been 
due to the mode coupling introduced by the perturbation. Two transmission zeros, located 
opposite each other with respect to the unperturbed resonance frequency, can be observed. 
Moreover, the transmission zeros disappear as the perturbation is removed (Zp/Zs=1), an 
important characteristic of a ring resonator having the degenerate modes be successfully 
split.  
Owing to its extraordinarily compact size, the input/output coupling structures of the 
filter should be designed with care to provide an adequate amount of coupling. To this 
end, the input/output microstrip lines are interdigitally coupled to the ring resonator with 
saw-toothed coupling structures, as shown in Fig. 5.1(c). The saw-toothed coupling 
structure increases the coupling at the feed port, but does not affect the mode splitting of 
the ring resonator. Fig. 5.3 shows the external quality factor versus the number of teeth 
and the width of the gap (sf1) of the saw-toothed coupling structure. The tighter the 
coupling is, the lower the external quality factor becomes. Considering 28 teeth and a gap 
width of 0.1 mm, the external quality factor is 34, approximately equal to the unloaded 
quality factor of the synthesized microstrip lines. It effectively reduces the in-band 
insertion loss. 
At the meantime, spurious passbands occur as the electrical length of the ring 
resonator becomes an integer multiple of the guided wavelength, i.e., ring = 2t+s+p = 
2n. Differing from a ring resonator using uniform lines, due to the rapid and nonlinear 
phase responses of the synthesized lines around the resonance of the LC tanks (Ll//Cd), 
the miniaturized filter shows two spurious passbands at 1.5 and 2.04 GHz, that is, ring = 
4at1.7f0 and 6at2.3f0; they are much lower than the regular second and third 
harmonics, 2f0 and 3f0, of the passband (f0).  
To suppress the first spurious passband at 1.5 GHz (1.7f0), two quarter-wavelength 
open-circuited stubs are introduced to the saw-toothed coupling structures. The feed point 
is virtually shorted out at the frequency when the electric length of the coupling arm 
complexity and measuring uncertainty, and a trade-off must be made. Developing a new 
unit cell having a higher quality factor is another way to improve the filter responses. The 
measured return loss (RL) is better than 10 dB within the passband. The transmission 
zeros are indicated in the figures. The zeros TZa and TZb are generated by the coupled 
degenerate modes of the ring resonator, and TZb shifts to a higher frequency due to the 
loading effects of the stubs. While the open-circuited stubs generate the transmission 
zeros TZoc1 and TZoc2, the zero TZATL is introduced by the LC tanks of the synthesized 
lines. These three transmission zeros can be controlled independently. 
Figure 5.5 illustrates the wideband responses from 0.3 to 4.5 GHz. The transmission 
response without the open-circuited stubs is depicted for comparison purpose. The 
fluctuation in the transmission response from 1.5-2 GHz is a result of the superposition of 
the spurious passbands and transmission zeros (TZoc1, TZoc2, TZATL). The transmission 
zeros are inherently narrowband, incapable of completely suppressing the spurious 
response. At the harmonics of the passband frequency, i.e. 1.7 (2f0), 2.55 (3f0) and 3.4 
GHz (4f0), the measured attenuations are -31, -39, and -28 dB, respectively, while in the 
simulation they are -32, -25, and -32 dB. According to HFSS simulation, the radiation 
loss around 3.4 GHz is less than 4% of the input power. The drop in |S11| is mainly a 
result of the power dissipation due to parasitic resonances in the synthesized lines. 
Table I compares the in-band responses of the miniaturized ring filter with those 
compact dual-mode ring filters in [5.2]-[5.5]. The proposed filter shows comparable 
in-band performances including return loss, insertion loss, and fractional bandwidth. 
However, it has a remarkable reduction in size, which is about one-half the sizes of the 
previous designs.

provide excellent signal suppression at higher-order harmonic frequencies. In Section 6.2, 
the design concept, circuit layout, electrical characteristics, and lumped equivalent circuit 
model of the new synthesized microstrip line are studied in detail. The simulated and 
measured results will be discussed in Section 6.3. For demonstration purpose, a compact 
quadrature hybrid coupler, integrated by the proposed lines, will be introduced as well. A 
brief summary will be concluded in Section 6.4. 
 
6.2  Design Concept and Analysis 
A section of conventional microstrip line can be approximately modeled by a 
number of alternatively connected series inductance and shunt capacitance. By replacing 
the series inductance and shunt capacitance with quasi-lumped components, a synthesized 
microstrip line can be developed with significantly shortened physical length. The circuit 
layouts of the proposed 50-ohm and 35-ohm synthesized microstrip lines are shown in 
Figs. 6.1(a) and (b). Here, the synthesized microstrip lines have an electrical length of 90 
degrees, and will be referred to as unit cells in the following discussion. The 
corresponding lumped equivalent circuit model is described in Fig. 6.2. 
Referring to Fig. 6.1, the unit cells are composed of three cascaded LC tanks in 
asymmetrical configurations along with two short microstrip lines for phase 
compensation. The quasi-lumped line inductors provide the required series inductance, 
while the necessary shunt-to-ground capacitance is mainly contributed by the parasitic 
capacitance of the interdigital capacitors. The 35-ohm unit cell adopts meandered line 
inductors, which can improve the area utilization in the development of the miniaturized 
quadrature hybrid. In the equivalent circuit model, the quasi-lumped line inductor is 
represented by a series inductor Ls and two parasitic shunt capacitors Cl. The capacitors 
Cs and Cm indicate, respectively, the series capacitance of the interdigital capacitors at the 
first and second stages of the line, and their fringing fields are accounted for by the 
The dimensions of the 50-ohm unit cell in Fig. 6.1(a) are l1 = 1.8 mm, l2 = 2.3 mm, l3 = 
1.6 mm, w1 = 0.15 mm, w2 = 3.5 mm, w3 = 1.1 mm, and s1 = 0.15 mm. At the meantime, 
the dimensions of the 35-ohm line in Fig. 6.1(b) are l4 = 0.65 mm, l5 = 3.4 mm, l6 = 0.2 
mm, w4 = 0.15 mm, w5 = 9.5 mm, w6 = 1.9 mm, w7 = 1.1 mm, and s2 = 0.15 mm. The 
sizes of 50- and 35-ohm unit cells are, respectively, 3.5 × 9.8 mm2 and 8.9 × 9.5 mm2, or 
equivalently, 0.045 × 0.127 g2 and 0.118 × 0.126 g2. The 50-ohm unit cell is one-fifth 
the length of its conventional counterpart. Here, g is the guided wavelength of a 50-ohm 
microstrip line on the same substrate at 2.4 GHz. The approximate lumped values of each 
quasi-lumped component can be readily extracted [6.5]. For the 50-ohm 90-degree unit 
cell, the extracted values are Ls = 1.44 nH, Cs = 0.48 pF, Cm = 0.39 pF, Cl = 0.05 pF, and

The electrical characteristics of the 50-ohm unit cell are discussed in this section. In 
Fig. 6.3, the simulated, measured and calculated characteristic impedances and phase 
delays of the 50-ohm unit cell are illustrated. The simulation was performed by the EM 
full-wave simulator Ansoft HFSS, while the measurement was taken by an Agilent 
E8363B network analyzer with the TRL calibration included. Meanwhile, the calculation 
was achieved by the Agilent ADS using the lumped equivalent circuit model shown in 
Fig. 6.2 along with the extracted element values. By utilizing the simulated, measured or 
calculated S-parameters, the characteristic impedance of the 50-ohm unit cell can be 
evaluated by [6.5],

According to Fig. 6.3, excellent agreement between the simulated, measured and 
design procedure is straightforward. By replacing the conventional quarter-wavelength 
lines with the proposed synthesized microstrip lines, a miniaturized quadrature hybrid is 
realized. To take into account the parasitic coupling and discontinuities at the junctions, 
the coupler is optimized using Ansoft HFSS. The final circuit layout is shown in Fig. 6.6. 
The geometric parameters are lq1 = 17.3, lq2 = 10.3, lq3 = 5, lq4 = 22.5, wq1 = 12.75, wq2 = 
8.95, wq3 = 1.1, wq4 = 1.9, and wq5 = 23.2. All units are in millimeters. The miniaturized 
hybrid only occupies a circuit area of 12.75 × 17.3 mm2, or equivalently, 0.166 × 0.226 
g2. When compared with a conventional design, the size reduction percentage is 50%. 
The simulated and measured S-parameters are described in Fig. 6.7, while the wideband 
responses are depicted in Fig. 6.8. At the center frequency, the measured return loss and 
isolation are 24.0 and 20.7 dB, respectively. The measured insertion losses at the output 
ports, i.e. ports 2 and 3, are 3.33 and 3.55 dB. The measured phase difference between the 
output ports, which is also not shown owing to insufficient space, is 90.3 degrees at 2.4 
GHz. Except for a small amount of frequency offset and slightly higher insertion losses, 
the measured results agree reasonably well with the simulated ones. The discrepancy can 
be accounted for by the fabrication tolerance and imperfect modeling of the conductors in 
the simulation. In addition, according to Fig. 8, at the second harmonic frequency, the 
signal rejections are 31.5 and 21.6 dB at the output ports. Meanwhile, the third harmonic 
can be suppressed by at least 40 dB. The isolations at the harmonic frequencies are better 
than 30 dB as well. With the demonstration, the outstanding performance of the proposed 
synthesized microstrip line is clearly manifested. 
 
6.4  Miniaturized six-port junctions with harmonic suppressions 
A. Design concept and circuit configuration 
In the development of the six-port junction, three different configurations, namely 
the types I, II, and III, can be adopted, as illustrated in Figs. 6.9 to 6.11. The type I design 
process involving full wave simulation is necessary to account for the junction effects. 
The geometric parameters associated with the interconnections are lp1 = lp2 = lp3 = lp4 = lp5 
= lp6 = lp7 = 5 mm, lm1 = 8.4 mm, lm2 = lm3 = 2.9 mm, lb = 1.3 mm, lt = 38.85 mm, wt = 
47.25 mm and wm = 1.1 mm. The detailed parameters of the unit cells are illustrate in 
Figs. 6.12. The size of the miniaturized six-port junction is 38.85 × 47.25 mm2, or 
equivalently 0.51 × 0.62 Ȫg2. As compared with a conventional design, the proposed 
six-port junction features a size reduction percentage of 51 %. Here g is also the guided 
wavelength of a conventional 50-ohm microstrip line on the same substrate at 2.4 GHz. 
This novel six-port junction is referred to as the case I design. 
Two additional six-port junctions, denoted as the cases II and III, are developed and 
shown in Figs. 6.13 and 6.14, respectively. Like the case I design, both six-port junctions 
consist of a Wilkinson power divider and three quadrature hybrids. However, the 
arrangements of the components are a little bit different. In the case II design, all hybrids 
are arranged in parallel while the power divider is placed opposite to the output ports. On 
the contrary, in the case III design all output ports are in parallel with the power divider 
while the port 2, as shown in Fig. 6.14, is placed on the opposite side. The geometric 
parameters of the interconnections for the case II design are lp1 = lp2 = lp4 = lp6 = 5 mm, lm1 
= 27 mm, lm2 = 7 mm, lm3 = 10 mm, lm4 = 2.9 mm, lt = 39.45 mm, wt = 67.55 mm, wb = 1.3 
mm and wm = 1.1 mm. For the Case III design, they are given by lp1 = lp2 = lp3 = lp6 = 5 
mm, lm1 = 9.7 mm, lm2 = 1.9 mm, lm3 = 6 mm, lm4 = 15.65 mm, lm5 = 2.9 mm, lt = 45 mm, 
wt = 57.55 mm, wb = 1.3 mm and wm = 1.1 mm. The dimensions of the case II and case III 
designs are 31.3 × 58.25 mm2 and 38.7 × 46.6 mm2, respectively, or equivalently 0.41 × 
0.76 Ȫg2 and 0.50 × 0.61 Ȫg2. The size reduction percentages of the two designs are the 
same as 52 %. The photographs of the fabricated samples of the three cases are shown in 
Figs. 6.15 to 6.17. 
B. Simulation and measurement 
in the signal path from port 2 to the output ports. Referring to Fig. 6.12, as the signal 
propagates from port 1 to the output ports, only one miniaturized quadrature hybrid is 
involved. On the other hand, two hybrids are included in the transmission path if the input 
signal is excited at port 2. The bandwidth simultaneously satisfying all specification 
reveals from 2.22 to 2.51 GHz, or equivalently, a fractional bandwidth of 12 %. 
For the case II design, Figs. 6.26 to 6.28 illustrate the simulated and measured return 
losses, isolations and insertion losses. The measured return losses at ports 1 and 2 are 
17.9 and 21.3 dB at 2.4 GHz while the isolation between them is 23.3 dB. As an incident 
wave is excited at port 1, the measured insertion losses are 6.60, 7.13, 6.61 and 7.07 dB at 
the center frequency. At the meantime, they are 6.70, 6.88, 6.75 and 6.85 dB as the port 2 
is excited. As illustrate in Fig. 6.29, the measured phase differences are 90.2, 90.7 and 0.9 
degrees when the excitation is at port 1. On the other hand, as the port 2 is served as the 
input, as described in Fig. 6.30, they are 90.4, 0.33 and -89.6 degrees, respectively. The 
measured wideband responses are shown in Figs. 6.31 to 6.33. Referring to the figures, at 
the second harmonic frequency the average attenuation levels with the port 2 being 
excited are 24 dB higher than those achieved as the port 1 is served as the input port. It 
can be explained by the same reason as discussed previously in the case I design. All 
simulated and measured results of the case III design, are shown in Figs. 6.34 to 6.41. 
According to the above discussions, all three designs show a comparable size reduction 
percentage and excellent harmonic suppression properties. However, the case I six-port 
junction reveals better performances than the other two cases do. 
 
6.5  Conclusion 
A novel synthesized microstrip line with harmonic suppression capability have been 
proposed and investigated in this paper. The proposed synthesized line demonstrates 
quasi-elliptic response, and is capable of synthesizing microstrip lines with a variety of

Chapter 7  An Impulse-radio Ultrawideband RF 
Front-end Module with A New Multilayer Microwave 
Sampler
7.1  Introduction 
Since the regulations by Federal Communication Committee (FCC) in United States 
in 2002, the ultrawideband (UWB) system has experienced a blooming growth in both 
industrial and academic fields. By dividing the allocated spectrum into sub-frequency 
bands, the ultrawideband system for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) provides 
high speed data transmission rate up to hundreds of Mbps in a 10-meter area. Meanwhile, 
the impulse-radio-based ultrawideband system, which transmits and receives baseband 
pulses without a carrier, is still very attractive to a variety of applications owing to its low 
circuit complexity, no need of mixing circuit, undetectable power spectral density, and 
high immunity against multi-path interference. In an impulse-radio-based ultrawideband 
system, subnanosecond impulses are used not only for transmitting the data streams but 
also for downsampling the received pulses in the receiver. It features various advantages 
over conventional communication radios [7.1]-[7.3]. The aim of this paper is to 
investigate a new impulse-radio-based ultrawideband RF front-end module for in-vehicle 
communication. A prototype module is realized with the help of a new multilayer 
magic-T [7.4]. The magic-T features a wide bandwidth and compact size. The design 
concept, methodology and simulated and experimental results will be discussed in 
Section II of this paper. 
The magic-T in Section 7.2 was optimized for microwave sampler application. A 
microwave sampler is an essential component in an impulse-radio-based ultrawideband 
communication system. Essentially, a microwave sampler can be viewed as a 
pulse generator along with low-frequency excitation circuit and an active lowpass filter. 
The performance of the transceiving module is demonstrated and discussed by both 
transmission links over coaxial cable and air interface. This chapter is concluded with a 
brief summary in Section 7.5. 
 
7.2 Design of the New Magic-T 
The magic-T, or the 180Ʊ hybrid coupler, is known as one of the core components in 
various microwave circuits [7.13]-[7.20]. Conventional magic-Ts are commonly designed 
with double-sided printed circuit broads by utilizing quarter-wavelength lines in either 
microstrip form [7.13], stripline form [7.14], microstrip/slotline hybrid form [7.15]-[7.16], 
coplanar waveguide (CPW)/slotline hybrid form [7.17], or waveguide form [7.18]. The 
sizes of these designs, nonetheless, are inevitably large due to the existence of multiple 
quarter-wavelength lines. To tackle this problem, an aperture coupled magic-T is 
proposed in [7.19] on a three-layer circuit board with a high dielectric constant (r=10.2). 
The operation bandwidth, however, is limited to several percentages. A multilayer 
magic-T with a significantly improved bandwidth of 78 % has also been demonstrated on 
a low-loss Rogers RT-5880 substrate (r=2.2) [7.20]. 
To design a compact multilayer magic-T with an even wider bandwidth, recently we 
discussed a new aperture coupled microstrip magic-T with a wideband 
microstrip-to-slotline Marchand balun [7.4]. The proposed design was fabricated on a low 
cost FR4 epoxy substrate to fulfill the cost reduction requirement. The circuit layout of 
the proposed magic-T is illustrated in Fig. 7.1(a). The proposed design consists of three 
metal layers. On the top layer (Layer 1), the microstrip line connected to port 1 is 
terminated with an open-circuited radial stub. A chip resistor is connected to the open end 
of the stub and provides the necessary current return path and resistive loading for the 
pulse generator attached to port 1. The resistor also minimizes the multi-reflections 
1, i.e. S12, is 4.41 GHz. It corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 94.2 %. The minimum 
insertion loss observed is 5 dB, which is 2 dB apart from the ideal value. The slightly 
higher insertion loss in the proposed design can be attributed to the lossy nature of the 
FR4 substrate used. The transmission coefficient at the sum port, i.e. S42 or S43, reveals a 
lower insertion loss of 3.7 dB. It also features a wider 3-dB insertion loss bandwidth from 
0.5 to 8 GHz. The isolation between the sum and difference ports is better than 35 dB 
over the frequency range of concern. Shown in Fig. 7.3(d) is the phase difference 
between the two output ports as the sum and difference ports are driven alternatively. 
Well-behaved phase response can be observed throughout the whole band. 
 
7.3  The Microwave Sampler 
By utilizing the proposed magic-T, we demonstrate a multilayer microwave sampler 
in this section. The configuration of the proposed microwave sampler is shown in Fig. 
7.1(b) along with the geometric parameters. Figure 7.4 illustrates the schematic diagram 
of the microwave sampler together with the pulse generators, sampling bridge, and IF 
lowpass filter. As shown in the figure, the pulse generator at the LO port periodically 
sends strobe signals for sampling the RF waveform. A pair of Schottky diodes with the 
same polarity is connected to the output ports, i.e. ports 2 and 3, of the magic-T. It forms 
a balanced sampling bridge. The sampling diode used is a low-barrier, low junction 
capacitance Schottky diode from M/A-COM® with part number MA4E2054-1141T. The 
IF signal is extracted in between the diode pair, and is terminated by a shunted RC tank. 
In practical application, the input impedance of the next stage can serve as the RC 
loadings. 
The strobe signals at the sampling bridge can be realized in several ways [7.21], 
[7.22]. In this paper, the strobes are enabled by a shunt-mode pulse generator [7.22]. The 
pulse generator consists of a series inductor L1, a series resistor R1 and a shunt-to-ground 
frequency is 500 kHz. Additionally, it is worthwhile to mention that owing to the nonzero 
reverse-biased junction capacitance of the sampling diode, the RF signals may AC couple 
to the IF port even when the sampling diodes are turned off. It gives rise to the RF 
leakage shown in Fig. 7.5(c). To filter out the high frequency components arisen from 
both the sampling strobes and RF leakage, we implement an active filter at the output of 
the microwave sampler, as illustrated in Fig. 7.4. The operational amplifier used is from 
TI Corporation with part number OPA695. The cutoff frequency is 8 MHz and the DC 
gain is 2.2. The filtered-out signal is shown in Fig. 7.5(d). The peak voltage is -0.4 V and 
the pulse repetition frequency is also 500 kHz. It is evident that the sampled waveform at 
the IF port is quite similar to the RF input except that the time scale has been downscaled 
to the microsecond (#s) order. Finally, it should be emphasized that in theory the RF 
waveform in the proposed microwave sampler could be an arbitrary periodical signal as 
long as the difference between the periods of the RF and LO signals is small enough to 
provide an adequate amount of sampling points. 
 
7.4  Ultrawideband RF Front-end module 
In this section, an impulse-radio-based ultrawideband transceiving module is 
demonstrated by implementing the multilayer microwave sampler. The proposed 
transceiving module aims at implementing in the RF front-end of a variety of 
ultrawideband systems such as in-vehicle communications, surveillance systems, and etc.  
The schematic circuit diagrams of the transmitting and receiving modules are shown in 
Fig. 7.6(a) and (b), respectively. In the transmitting module, the CITIZEN® crystal 
oscillator CSX-750FC generates a clock signal with a clock rate of 32.768 MHz and 
peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.6 V. A TI® frequency multiplier SN65LVDS150 multiplies 
the clock frequency by a factor of 9. The multiplier is followed by a differential line 
driver SN65LVDT2DBVR to convert the differential signal at the output of the multiplier 
The overall antenna size including the finite size ground plane is 60*60 mm2. The 
geometric parameters are La = 22.4 mm, Lb = 12 mm, r1 = 22 mm, r2 = 20 mm, and LGND 
= 20 mm. The simulated and measured return losses are shown in Fig. 7.8(b). The 
agreement between the results is very well. The operating bandwidth with return loss 
better than 10 dB is from 2 to more than 11 GHz. The simulated and measured radiation 
patterns at 4 GHz, i.e. the center frequency of the pulse spectrum, are illustrated in Fig. 
7.8(c). For simplicity here only the co-polarized component, E, in the xy-plane is shown. 
Referring to the figure, the antenna demonstrates quite omnidirectional pattern at the 
principal plane. The measured antenna peak gain, which occurs at the broadside direction, 
is 2.7 dBi. 
The receiving module consists of a template pulse generator, a microwave sampler, 
and an active lowpass filter. In Fig. 7.6(b) the multilayer microwave sampler has been 
represented by its equivalent circuit model. The template pulse generator has a similar 
configuration to the shunt-mode pulse generator used in the transmitting module except 
that the frequency of the crystal oscillator is now 24.5536 MHz. By a multiplier factor of 
12, the output clock rate is 294.6432 MHz. Unlike the transmitting module, however, 
here a pulse generator alone is adequate enough for generating LO strobes for sampling 
the received waveform. The strobe impulse converts into a pair of monocycle pulses with 
reverse polarity in the microwave sampler, as has been demonstrated in Fig. 7.5(b). The 
RF waveform received by the ultrawideband antenna is first divided into two branches by 
the T-junction of the sampler. It is then periodically sampled by the strobe impulses at the 
balanced sampling bridge. According to the equivalent time sampling theory [7.6], the 
equivalent sampling interval between two consecutive samples can be evaluated by 
              |1 1 | 3.093 .LO RFt f f ps                 (7.1) 
In other words, if the pulse width of the RF signal is 500 ps, every single pulse 
reconstructed at the IF output will consist of more than 160 samples. Accordingly, the 
circuit. Figure 7.11 shows experimental setup for validating the transceiving module over 
air interface. The experiment was completed in an anechoic chamber at National Taiwan 
University of Science and Technology. Two abovementioned ultrawideband antennas 
were mounted on the bakelite supporters to transmit and receive the modulated pulse train. 
The separation distance between the antennas was 2.3 m. The instruments including the 
power supply, oscilloscope, arbitrary waveform generator, and etc. were carefully shield 
by electromagnetic wave absorber to reduce multipath interference. The antenna arm in 
the background of the measurement setup, however, can be hardly shielded since the 
chamber is originally design for near-field measurement. Throughout the measurement 
the data rate is set to 270 kbps, which in turn implies that each filtered-out bit contains 
only one downsampled pulse.  Four repeated bit patterns, including 0101, 0111, 0001, 
and 0011, were fed into the transmitting module. The waveforms at the filter output are 
illustrated in Fig. 7.12. Due to the limited space, the waveforms are offset by 0, 50, 100, 
and 150 mV to facilitate the plot in the same figure. Referring to the figure, the outputs 
clearly demonstrate the desired bit patterns which can be readily demodulated by a 
baseband processor. Figure 7.13 illustrates the received amplitude versus the separation 
distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas. Both data rates are evaluated at 
four different separations, i.e. 0.35, 1.0, 1.65, and 2.3 m. Referring to the figure, the 
output waveform roughly follows the 1/R fading. The maximum transmitting distance is 
estimated to be 4.5 m since the minimum detectable threshold is 5 mV above the average 
value of the bit streams, as has been illustrated in Fig. 7.12. Finally, it should be 
emphasized that further increasing the transmission data rate can be accomplished in two 
ways. Firstly, at the expense of a lower sampling accuracy, the data rate can be 
significantly improved by increasing the frequency difference between the RF and LO 
signals. For example, a transmission data rate of 2 Mbps is possible if the LO frequency 
is retuned to 292.912 MHz. However, the sampling points per reconstructed pulse drop

Chapter 8  Conclusion 
In this project, novel artificial transmission lines in microstrip/stripline/coplanar 
waveguide (CPW) forms with double-layer or multi-layer fabrication process have been 
proposed and experimentally verified. Lumped equivalent circuit models, which are 
capable of explaining the complicated behavior of the proposed artificial lines have been 
introduced and discussed carefully. Two artificial lines in microstrip form are realized 
using double layer fabrication process. The first one is applied to the design of dual-mode 
ring bandpass filters, and the other one is applied to the development of miniaturized 
quadrature hybrid couplers and six-port junctions with harmonic suppression capability.  
Two novel synthesized lines in CPW form are utilized to the development of the 
miniaturized backward-wave edge-coupled directional coupler, backward-wave 
broadside-coupled directional coupler, forward-wave edge-coupled directional coupler, 
rat-race couplers, and dual-mode bandpass filters, all rendering very compact sizes. The 
artificial line in stripline form is developed using a six-layer printed circuit board 
fabrication process. Various miniaturized designs including broadside couplers and 
broadside Marchand balun are demonstrated using the artificial stripline. The sizes of all 
designs are very compact when compared with the designs reported in literatures using 
similar PCB fabrication process.  
On the other hand, an impulse-radio-based RF front-end module for ultra-wideband 
communication has been proposed and demonstrated. It is designed based a novel 
compact microwave sampler. The transmitting module consists of a low-frequency 
excitation circuit, a modulator, an impulse generator, and a power amplifier. The 
modulator is realized by a single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) switch. The receiving 
module, on the other hand, is composed of a microwave sampler, a template pulse
