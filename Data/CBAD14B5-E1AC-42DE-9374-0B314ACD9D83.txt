None of them consider the factor of deterioration. 
  Since retailer is mostly managed by small business, the limited resource of working 
capital is a factor worth considering. In this study, a deteriorated multi-item for a retailer 
with restricted resources is considered for an integrated warehouse-retailer inventory 
system to develop an optimal integrated inventory system. An example to illustrate the 
benefits of the model is given. 
 
2. Mathematical modeling and analysis 
 
  The mathematical model is developed on the basis of the following assumptions: 
(a) A single-vendor and single-buyer system with multi-items is considered. 
(b) Deterioration of the units is considered only after they have been received into 
inventory.  
(c) The deterioration rate is the same at both the buyer and the vendor; and the 
deterioration rate is proportional to on-hand stock for each item. 
(d) The demand rate is constant. 
(e) The buyer is restricted by working capital. 
 
  The following notation is used: 
     θ i   The deterioration rate for item i, i=1, 2…k 
     k     Number of items considered 
     Imbi   Buyer’s delivery lot size for item i, i=1,2,…k

The annual buyer’s total cost, TCb is the sum of (18), (20) and (22). The annual vendor 
total cost, TCv is the sum of (19), (21) and (23). The integrated annual total cost, TC of 
the buyer and the vendor is the sum of TCb and TCv. The TC is a function of a set of 
variables: Ti and ni, where i=1, 2…k. 
Since a retailer is always a small scale of business, the working capital is so tight as to 
decrease the order quantity. The above problem becomes as a constrained nonlinear 
programming shown as follows:

  The optimal lot size of the retailer and warehouse are (12) and (13) respectively. 
 
4. Numerical example 
 
  The preceding theory can be illustrated by the following numerical example. To 
simplify computation, two items are considered. The annual demand for item 1 and 2 is 
40,000 and 10,000 units respectively. The respective unit cost at warehouse for item 1 
and 2 is $10 and $100. The unit cost at retailer for item 1 and 2 is $12 and $130. The 
ordering cost at distribution center for item 1 and 2 is $4,000 and $5,000. The ordering 
cost at retailer for item 1 and 2 is $300 and $500. The percentage of holding cost at 
warehouse for item 1 and 2 is 8% and 10% per unit per year. The percentage of holding 
cost at retailer for item 1 and 2 is 25% and 35%. The yearly deterioration rate for item 1 
and 2 is 8% and 10% respectively. 
  If the retailer’s working capital is an abundant resource, the optimal solution set, { , 
,  and } can be obtained by (36)-(38). By (12) and (13), the optimal quantities

5. Comment on the numerical example 
 
  It is seen from Table 2 that the percentage of cost reduction for the integrated system is 
approximately 10%. From Table 3, the cost of TCr is not sensitive to the ordering policy, 
while the cost of TCw is highly sensitive to the ordering policy. It is evident that the 
decision made by considering the integrated view of both the retailer and the warehouse 
is better.

7. Comment on the sensitivity analysis 
 
  The main conclusions drawn from the sensitivity analysis are as follows: 
(1) The PICR value is more sensitive to the changes in working capital constraints 
and the demand, less sensitive to the other parameters. The range of PICR 
values is from 1.94% to 26.86%. The average value of PICR from above 
sensitivity analysis is 10% approximately.  
(2) From Table 5, when the working capital decreases, the PICR value increases 
from 1.94% to 26.86%. The relationship between PICR and working capital is 
depicted in Figure 3. Hence, for a low working capital, there is a greater need to 
apply the integrated policy. 
(3) From Table 4, when the demand changes, the PICR value is in the range of 
8%-12% approximately. If the demand rate is changed, the lot-size of 
warehouse is affected more than that of retailer.  
(4) From Table 6-7, when the holding cost decreases, the PICR value increases 
from 8.37% to 12.21%. The lot-size of warehouse is changed more seriously 
than that of retailer.  
(5) From Table 8, when the deterioration rate decreases, the PICR value increases 
from 8.29% to 12.32% approximately. The lot-size of warehouse is influenced 
more than that of retailer by deterioration rate change. 
(6) From Table 9-10, when the ordering cost or unit cost increases, the PICR value 
increases from 6.17% to 17.20% approximately. 
(7) It is logical that the lot-size of distribution center is more vulnerable to be 
influenced by each parameter than that of retailer because the average 
inventory level of warehouse is much more than that of retailer. 
 
8. Conclusion 
   
  In this paper, a mathematical model of limited resources for deteriorating items with 
constant demand rate is developed to derive an optimal ordering policy. It has been 
shown through the example that the optimal policy using the integrated approach has 
reduced the total joint cost for both the retailer and warehouse. However, the retailer’s 
cost is a slightly higher using the integrated approach than the independent decision 
without considering the perspective of the warehouse. To motivate their cooperation, an 
incentive in the form of quantity discount or cost reduction for the retailer to cooperate 
must be incorporated into the system to make it more realistic. This will be done in 
further research.

Since Cr1 and Cr21 is larger than Cw1 and Cw21 respectively, one can assume:

Since (A6) is greater than zero, the convexity of the integrated total cost is proved. The 
function in (28) is the sum of k convex functions; therefore the total cost is a convex

Abstract 
 
This study develops an optimal pricing and replenishment policy in an arborescent 
(tree-like) supply chain system. Since it benefits the up-streams more than the 
down-streams when a producer, a distributor and multiple retailers are integrated, a 
pricing strategy with price reduction is derived to entice the down-streams to accept the 
incentive system with minimum total cost. Negotiation factors are incorporated to 
balance the cost saving between the players. Two numerical examples solved by heuristic 
technique and GA (genetic algorithm) respectively are provided to illustrate the theory 
and the two problem-solving tools. The result shows that the percentage of total cost 
reduction incurred from the integration is quite impressive.

1. Introduction 
 
The term leagile has been used by Naylor et al. [14] to include two important 
concepts: leanness and agility. Leanness emphasizes cost reduction with total waste 
removal to maximize profits and providing service through a level schedule. Agility 
requires design of total flexibility to maximize profits through providing exactly what the 
customer requires at minimum cost. Finch [3] has studied the relationship between the 
JIT concept and quality improvement. Through information technology, each player 
receives the marketplace data directly to reduce lead times and avoid bullwhip effect. 
They concluded that lot-size reduction could improve quality due to less scrap and 
quicker response time. 
Recently, much attention has been focused on the integration of vendor and buyer. 
Since the vendor has greater benefits than the buyer does, the buyer may not have much 
motivation to cooperate. To entice the buyer to cooperate and order more quantity, some

percentage total cost reduction and the demand coefficient of variation. 
 
2. Mathematical modeling and analysis 
 
Three scenarios are discussed. The first scenario neglects integration and price 
reduction. The second scenario considers the integration of all the players without 
considering price reduction. The last scenario considers integration and price reduction of 
all players simultaneously. 
The mathematical model in this study is developed on the basis of the following 
assumptions: 
(a) The replenishment rates of the distributor and the retailers are instantaneous, 
while the producer’s replenishment rate is finite. 
(b) Each retailer has constant demand rate. 
(c) All-unit price reduction is considered. 
(d) All players have complete knowledge of each other’s information. 
(e) A producer, a distributor and multiple retailers are considered. 
(f) Shortage is not allowed. 
(g) Unit purchase price is assumed to be the same for all retailers in scenario 1 and 2

When each negotiation factor is zero, it means all saving are accrued to the retailers; 
when 1=β  and 1=α , it implies that the total cost saving is equally distributed between 
the producer, the distributor, and the retailers. A large β  means that benefit is accrued 
mainly to the producer. A large α  means that benefit is accrued mainly to the distributor.

From (26), (27) and (28), by means of the Variable-Reduction Method, each Pr3j and Pd3 
can be derived as a function of variables, np3, n3j and Tr3j. Therefore, the integrated total 
cost, TC3 is a function of variables, np3, n3j and Tr3j. 
 
3. Heuristic solution procedure  
 
For scenario 1 in buyer’s market, there are three-step procedures as follows: 
(1a) Each buyer made his first-step decision of Tr1j by taking the first derivative of TCr1j 
from (6) with respect to Tr1j to zero and solving Tr1j.  
(1b) After substituting (9) into (8), the distributor’s total cost (8) has N variables: n11, 
n12…n1N, whose optimal values (denoted by n11*, n12*…n1N*) must satisfy the 
following condition:

   This study derives the number of deliveries per period to minimize the total cost. The 
objective function is  with decision variables T),,( ijpiriji nnTTC rij, npi and nij. GA deals 
with a chromosome of the problem instead of decision variables. The values of Trij, npi 
and nij can be determined by the following GA procedure: 
(a) Representation: Chromosome encoding is the first problem that must be considered in 
applying GA to solve an optimization problem. Phenotype could represent a real 
numbers and an integer numbers here. For each chromosome, real numbers and 
integer numbers representation are used as follows: 
         )...,,,...,(),,( 2121 iNiipiriNririijpirij nnnnTTTnnTx ==
(b) Initialization: Generate a random population of n chromosomes (which are suitable 
solutions for the problem) 
(c) Evaluation: Assess the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population. The 
fitness value fk = f(xk) = TCi( xk) where k= 1, 2…n 
(d) Selection schemes: Select two parent chromosomes from a population based on their 
fitness using a roulette wheel selection technique, thus ensuring high quality have a 
higher chance of becoming parents than low quality individuals. 
(e) Crossover: Approximately 50%-75% crossover probability exists, indicating the 
probability that the parents will cross over to form new offspring. If no crossover 
occurs, the offspring are an exact copy of the parents. 
(f) Mutation: About 0.5%-1.0% of population mutation rate mutate new offspring at each 
locus (position in the chromosome). Accordingly, the offspring might have genetic 
material information not inherited from either parent, thus avoiding falling into the 
local optimum. 
(g) Replacement: An elitist strategy and a steady-state evolution are used to generate a 
new population, which can be used for an additional algorithm run.

$20,106. Since the producer benefits $10,728, the distributor benefits $12,297 and the 
retailers lose $2,919, the retailers will resist integrating in such condition. 
   To entice the retailers to cooperate in implementing the integrated system, the 
upstream offers some discount to the downstream in the selling price or permissible delay 
in payment. Subject to the negotiation factors β =1/4, α =1/4, 7/31 =γ and 7/42 =γ , 
the optimal retailers’ replenishment intervals are = 0.4094 years and = 0.2047 
years. The reduction of the total annual cost from scenario 1 to scenario 3 is $20,656. The 
reduced transaction prices for retailer 1, retailer 2 and the distributor are $23.425 (6.30% 
price discount), $23.817 (4.73% price discount) and $19.480 (2.60% price discount) 
respectively.

In the condition of the same total demand, the relationship between PTCR3 and the 
demand coefficient of variation is given in Table 2 and Figure 4. If demand coefficient of 
variation remains unchanged, the relationship between PTCR3 and the demand average is 
given in Table 3 and Figure 5.  
The PTCR3 value is more sensitive to the demand rate, and less sensitive to the 
negotiation factors. From Table 2 and Figure 4, the PTCR3 value increases when 
demand’s coefficient of variation decreases. Therefore, the integration effect is better for 
retailers’ cluster with similar demand level. From Table 3 and Figure 5, the PTCR3 values 
decrease with demand average due to smaller replenishment interval. 
The sensitivity analysis of the two negotiation factors is shown in Table 4. When the 
values of β  and α  become larger, the integrated total cost increases. The minimum 
integrated total cost occurs when all benefits are accrued to the retailers: β  and α  
equal to zero (Table 4).

6.  Concluding remark 
 
   Using heuristic technique and GA (genetic algorithm), an optimal pricing and 
replenishment strategy is derived in an arborescent supply chain system. This paper 
shows that the integration effect results in an impressive percentage total cost reduction, 
and the price reduction provides an incentive system to entice the retailers to order more 
quantity for mutual benefits. Negotiation factors are incorporated to share the cost saving 
benefits. The minimum integrated total cost is when the negotiation factors equal to zero. 
If the negotiation factors decrease, the integrated total cost decreases. The sacrifice of the 
producer’s and the distributor’s benefits result in less total cost and more percentage total 
cost reduction. 
   In the condition of the same total demand, the percentage of total cost reduction 
increases with the smaller demand coefficient of variation. It is proper to integrate the 
retailers’ cluster with similar demand level due to better integration effect. In the 
condition of the same demand coefficient of variation, the percentage total cost reduction 
decreases with total demand due to smaller replenishment interval. It is proper to make 
the replenishment interval larger when the demand rate becomes less.
