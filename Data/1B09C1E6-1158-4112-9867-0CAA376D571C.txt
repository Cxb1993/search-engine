1 Introduction
More recently, IPTV services have been increasing
rapidly due to the significant growth of bandwidth in
wired and wireless access networks. Particularly, with
the explosive growth of the amount of wireless end de-
vices such as laptops, smart phones and mobile TV sets,
the demand on IPTV service delivery over wireless net-
works [1, 2, 3] such as WLAN, 3G/4G, and WiMAX has
been growing tremendously. However, to support IPTV
services over wireless networks is still a challenging task
due to a higher packet error rate in the wireless chan-
nel. To provide the QoS guarantee for IPTV services
over wireless networks, several cross-layer designs were
presented in recent literature [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. These cross-
layer designs aim to enable interactions between several
protocol layers for achieving better performance. For
example, according to the results in [9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
the QoS of video transmission over a wireless network
was demonstrated to be further improved based on the
cross-layer information.
The authors of [9] proposed an adaptive cross-layer
protection strategy for enhancing the robustness and
efficiency of scalable video transmission. Their scheme
is based on evaluating different error control and adap-
tation mechanisms available in the different layers for
robust transmission of video, namely MAC retrans-
mission strategy, application-layer FEC, bandwidth-
adaptive compression using scalable coding, and adap-
tive packetization strategies. In [10], an adaptive cross-
layer fragmentation scheme was proposed to provide
a reliable and QoS-based IPTV service delivery over
802.11 WLAN. Their fragmentation approach consid-
ers both the loss ratio and MAC overhead ratio. But
it does not take the random backoff effect in IEEE
802.11 WLAN into consideration. Additionally, based
on the observation of RTT (Round-Trip Time) vari-
ability, the work in [11] proposed adaptive cross-layer
schemes for multimedia delivery over the time-varying
wireless channels, including the MAC layer retry limit,
the application layer FEC control, and selecting a frag-
ment size.
It is well-known that the timing or timestamp in-
formation is mandatory for video streaming services.
Thus, the study [12] presented a deadline-aware schedul-
ing algorithm for video streaming applications over a
wireless shared channel. The presented method adopts
the Decoding Timestamp (DTS) for calculating the
deadline and slows down the transmission of streams
to users with favorite channel conditions until their
deadline is approaching. In [13], the authors pro-
posed a time-based adaptive retry (TAR) mechanism
for MPEG-like video streaming over 802.11 wireless net-
works. TAR dynamically determines whether to send
or discard a packet based on its retransmission deadline
instead of adopting a static retry limit. The retrans-
mission deadline for each video packet is determined
based on the temporal relationship and error propaga-
tion characteristics of different video frames.
Based on the researches mentioned above, it is ex-
tremely necessary to adapt the MAC fragment size to
the time-varying wireless channel conditions. In addi-
tion, for IPTV service delivery over the wireless net-
works the stringent delay and jitter constraints should
be met, since the video frames violating their presen-
tation deadlines will be dropped (i.e., lateness loss) at
the receiver. Undoubtedly, the presentation deadlines
of all video frames must be considered in the cross-layer
design for improving the video playout quality. Con-
sequently, in this project we will propose a cross-layer
design which takes both the MAC fragment size and the
presentation deadline into consideration. Numerical re-
sults will show that our cross-layer design can improve
the goodput of the wireless channel and avoid a waste
of wireless channel bandwidth on serving useless MAC
frames which are late for playout at the receiver.
The rest of this study is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, the proposed cross-layer design is delineated. In
Section 3, the MAC layer throughput is derived in terms
of the channel bit error rate and the fragment size. Sev-
eral experimental examples will be demonstrated in Sec-
tion 4. Finally, in Section 5, we make our concluding
remarks.
2 Cross-Layer Design for IPTV
Services Over WLANs
For IPTV services, RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)
[14] and MPEG TS (Transport Stream) [15] are usually
used. For these two application (APP) protocols, pre-
sentation timestamps (PTS) and decoding timestamps
(DTS) are employed for the video synchronization pur-
pose. For example, a 32-bit timestamp field is allocated
in the RTP protocol header. The timestamps of RTP
packets can be utilized to calculate the jitter encoun-
tered in the network. In addition, these timestamps
can be used for determining the presentation times of
video frames at the receiver. With the help of presenta-
tion timestamps, the video playout quality can be main-
tained. However, in the wireless network packet retrans-
missions due to the higher channel error rate can result
in extra packet delay. The video packet with a longer
delay will be discarded at the receiver if it misses the
presentation deadline. The packet loss due to missing
its presentation deadline is named the lateness loss.
To improve the lateness loss rate of video frames, in
this study we propose a cross-layer design based on the
1
3 Throughput Analysis for IEEE
802.11 WLAN
In the following, we will focus on the last-hop wireless
network within a home. Since the minimum contention
window size CWmin is 32 and the number of users
within a home is usually small, the collisions among
stations can be usually ignored. And the WLAN per-
formance will be dominated by the transmission error
due to the multipath problem encountered in a room.
As a result, the simplified WLAN model assumed in
this section will consist of a wireless AP and a mobile
station. The DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)
access mode is also assumed in the WLAN model. The
purpose of this section is to understand how the wireless
channel throughput reacts to the channel bit error rate
and the fragment size. We assume that video streaming
packets are transmitted from the AP to the mobile sta-
tion. The mobile station receives the video packets and
replies acknowledgements (ACKs) only if the packets re-
ceived are correct. Other uplink traffic from the mobile
station to the AP is assumed to be negligible when a
streaming service is undertaking. Based on this simple
model, we will derive the relationship among the MAC
layer throughput S, the channel bit error rate e and the
MAC fragment size L under the full load assumption at
the AP.
In the following analysis, the channel bit error rate e
is assumed to be fixed. Each IP packet coming from the
wired network is assumed to be 1500 bytes. The (i+1)-
st MAC fragment size Li (in bytes), not including the
MAC layer header, in an IP packet is represented by
Li =
{
L, 0 ≤ i < ⌊1500/L⌋ = n0,
1500 mod L, i = n0.
(5)
That is, the total number of fragments in each IP packet
equals n0+1. Denote the MAC header length byH bits,
then the frame error rate of the (i+1)-st MAC fragment,
pi, can be given by
pi = 1− (1− e)
H+8Li . (6)
If the retry limit is NR, the probability of a success-
ful transmission for the (i+ 1)-st MAC fragment, PS,i,
equals
PS,i =
NR∑
j=0
(1− pi)p
j
i . (7)
And the probability of a failed transmission for the (i+
1)-st MAC fragment is denoted by PF,i = 1− PS,i.
Subsequently, denote the transmission time of the (i+
1)-st MAC frame by TD,i. Then we have TD,i = (H +
8Li)/R, where R is the transmission rate of the WLAN.
And denote the required cycle times for each successful
and each failed MAC frame transmissions by TS,i and
TF,i, respectively. We have
TS,i = Tφ + TD,i + SIFS + Tφ + TA, (8)
TF,i = DIFS + Tφ + TD,i + TO, (9)
where Tφ and TA are the transmission times for the
physical header and the acknowledgement frame, re-
spectively. SIFS and DIFS are the Short IFS (Inter
Frame Space) and DCF IFS, respectively. TO is the
timeout duration for retransmission.
In our analysis, the propagation delay in the wire-
less network is ignored. The minimum stage of the
contention window (CW) is set to be 5, and the maxi-
mum stage is 10. For the exponential backoff algorithm,
whenever a frame transmission is successful, the back-
off stage will be reset to 5. If a transmission fails, the
backoff stage will be increased by 1 and will remain un-
changed when it reaches 10. In the following, we first
consider the case that the retry limit NR is not less
than 4. For each IP packet, the first MAC fragment al-
ways requires a random backoff time. And this backoff
time depends on the condition that whether the previ-
ous MAC frame transmission is successful. Hence, the
average backoff time of the first fragment in an IP packet
at its j-th retransmission can be represented by
b0,j =
(
PS,n0 ×
min(25+j , 210)− 1
2
+PF,n0 ×
210 − 1
2
)
× slot time. (10)
The first and the second terms in (10) are the required
backoff times when the last fragment of the previous
IP packet is transmitted successfully and unsuccessfully,
respectively. Since the retry limit satisfies NR ≥ 4, an
unsuccessful frame transmission means that the backoff
stage will be increased to 10 at the moment of the next
MAC frame transmission. So the average backoff time
will be (210 − 1)× slot time/2, given that the previous
MAC frame is corrupted. Subsequently, the average
throughput (excluding the MAC header) for the first
fragment of an IP packet can be written as
S0 =
PS,0 × 8L0/R
NR∑
j=0
[B0,j + jTF,0 +DIFS + TS,0] (1− p0)p
j
0
,
(11)
where B0,j =
∑j
k=0 b0,k. The denominator of (11) can
be regarded as the mean time required for the first
MAC frame of an IP packet to be transmitted, given
it is transmitted successfully. Figure 3 illustrates the
required time for the first MAC frame (i = 0) of an IP
packet to be transmitted successfully.

4.1 Throughput Versus the Fragment
Size
The relationship between the fragment size L and the
MAC layer throughput S has been analyzed in the pre-
vious section. Here, we use simulations to verify our
analytical results in Section 3. In the first simulation
scenario, the WLAN consists of a streaming agent and
a mobile station. We assume that the streaming agent
is fully loaded and always has IP packets for transmis-
sion. The length of each IP packet is assumed to be
1500 bytes. Other related simulation parameters for
802.11 WLAN are listed in Table 1. Figure 5 shows the
normalized throughput versus the fragment size under
different bit error rates, including both the analysis and
simulation results. According to Fig. 5, the analytical
results are very close to the simulation results. Addi-
tionally, we observe that if the fragment size is small,
such as less than 200 bytes, the MAC protocol over-
head ratio will be large so that the throughput becomes
low. When the bit error rate e is 10−5, the throughput
increases with the fragment size initially and then be-
comes almost saturated. However, if the bit error rate e
is greater than 5×10−5, the throughput may degrade at
larger fragment sizes. Therefore, under a low bit error
rate channel condition, it is not necessary to fragment
an IP packet. But under a high bit error rate channel
condition, the IP packets are required to be fragmented,
e.g., the optimal fragment size is about 200 bytes when
the bit error rate is 10−4 according to Fig. 5. Con-
sequently, the optimal fragment sizes for MAC frames
under different channel error rates can be found based
on our analysis presented in Section 3.
4.2 Evaluation of the Proposed Cross-
Layer Design
Next, we will evaluate the performance of our proposed
cross-layer design over IEEE 802.11 WLAN. In our sim-
ulations, we use the MPEG-4 encoded video, Jurassic
Park I [18], as the video streaming source. This MPEG-
4 video is VBR and has average bit rate 770 kbps, and
the frame rate of this MPEG-4 video is 25 fps. That

Figure 5: Normalized throughput versus the fragment
size under various bit error rates. (NR = 4)
is, the presentation timestamps are evenly spaced by 40
ms. In the following, all video frames are transmitted
from the video server to the streaming agent, and are
jittered by the cross-traffic when they traverse the wired
network depicted in Fig. 1. Pareto ON-OFF traffic pat-
tern with parameters (burst time, idle time) = (400 ms,
600 ms) is chosen as the cross-traffic in our simulations.
The cross-traffic load in the wired network is denoted
by ρ. Different ρ’s will result in different network jitters
for video packets. Then the streaming agent will for-
ward the video packets to the mobile station according
to our cross-layer design described in Section 2. Other
simulation parameters for IEEE 802.11 are listed in Ta-
ble 1. Here, the constant transmission rate 11 Mbps is
assumed in our simulations. The proposed cross-layer
design uses inequality (4) and the number of retries to
determine whether a MAC frame need be sent or not,
while in the conventional scheme all MAC frames will be
always transmitted unless the number of retries exceeds
the retry limit. Both our proposed mechanism and the
conventional scheme can fragment an IP packet based
on the channel conditions.
In the second simulation scenario, the cross-traffic
load ρ in the wired network is set to 0.6. Only a stream-
ing agent and a mobile station exists in the WLAN. And
in the WLAN, no background traffic exists except the
considered streaming video traffic. The bit error rate
of the wireless channel is fixed at 10−4 and the playout
delay at the mobile station is set to 5 seconds. The late-
ness loss rate of APP video frames is presented in Fig.
6. Notably, the lateness losses can only occur at the mo-
bile station for the conventional scheme. While for our
proposed cross-layer design, the lateness losses can only
occur at the streaming agent. Because a larger frag-
ment size leads to a larger frame error rate, more frame
retransmissions may be required. As a result, the larger

Figure 9: Lateness loss rate of video frames at the APP
layer under ρ = 0.6 and ρw = 0.5.
WLAN is heavy, such as ρw = 0.5, the lateness loss rate
will grow significantly when the fragment size is less
than about 300 bytes, even though the bit error rate is
low (e = 10−5). This is because that the overhead ratio
will become large if the fragment size is too small. So the
traffic load in the WLAN grows significantly and yields
a large delay. Consequently, the lateness loss rate in-
creases significantly. Similarly, our proposed cross-layer
design performs better than the conventional scheme
in terms of the lateness loss rate. And at the small
fragment size, owing to the high lateness loss rate the
corresponding goodput degrades seriously, as shown in
Fig. 10. According to the results in Figs. 6 and 9, the
fragment size must not be chosen large when the bit er-
ror rate is high, such as e = 10−4. That is, an IP packet
need be fragmented under a high channel error rate con-
dition. When the bit error rate is low, e.g., e = 10−5,
a larger fragment size will have a better performance.
Hence, it is not necessary to fragment an IP packet if
the channel has a low bit error rate. This conclusion is
consistent with that in Fig. 5.
Subsequently, the wireless channel is assumed to be
time-varying and is modeled by a two-state Markov
chain [16] given by Fig. 2. The transition rates α and β
in Fig. 2 are set to 30 sec−1 and 10 sec−1 [16], respec-
tively. The bit error rate in State G is assumed to be
10−5, while it equals 10−4 in State B. According to Fig.
5, the optimal fragment sizes in States G and B can be
set to 1500 bytes and 200 bytes, respectively.
In the fourth simulation scenario, the network con-
figuration is the same as the previous example. The
cross-traffic load in the wired network is ρ = 0.3 and
the playout delay is set to 5 seconds at the mobile sta-
tion. Figures 11 and 12 show the lateness loss rate and
the goodput of video frames, respectively, under various
background traffic loads in the WLAN. One can observe

論文
摘要
Recently, IPTV services over Internet and wireless networks have been
increasing rapidly. Hence, in this paper we introduce a presentation
deadline-based cross-layer design for improving the QoS of IPTV services over
wireless networks. Our cross-layer design uses the presentation timestamp in the
RTP packet header to derive a presentation deadline for each MAC frame. In
our design, the wireless Access Point (AP) uses the presentation deadline and
the number of retries to determine whether a MAC frame can be sent or not.
Moreover, the MAC fragment size can adapt to the wireless channel conditions.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed cross-layer design can avoid a
waste of wireless channel resources on serving useless MAC frames which will
be dropped at the receiver due to missing their presentation deadlines. In
addition, the proposed cross-layer design can achieve a lower lateness loss rate
and a better application layer goodput for IPTV services.

Abstract
Recently, IPTV services over Internet and wireless networks
have been increasing rapidly. Hence, in this paper we
introduce a presentation deadline-based cross-layer design for
improving the QoS of IPTV services over wireless networks.
Our cross-layer design uses the presentation timestamp in the
RTP packet header to derive a presentation deadline for each
MAC frame. In our design, the wireless Access Point (AP)
uses the presentation deadline and the number of retrys to
determine whether a MAC frame can be sent or not.
Moreover, the MAC fragment size can adapt to the wireless
channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed cross-layer design can avoid a waste of wireless
channel resources on serving useless MAC frames which will
be dropped at the receiver due to missing their presentation
deadlines. In addition, the proposed cross-layer design can
achieve a lower lateness loss rate and a better application
layer goodput for IPTV services.
1 Introduction
More recently, IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) services
have been increasing rapidly due to the significant growth of
bandwidth in wired and wireless access networks. Particularly,
with the explosive growth of the amount of wireless end
devices such as laptops, smart phones and mobile TV sets, the
demand on IPTV service delivery over wireless networks
[6,10] such as WLAN, 3G/4G, and WiMAX has been
growing tremendously. However, to support IPTV services
over the wireless network is still a challenging task due to the
higher packet error rate in the wireless channel. To provide
the QoS guarantee for IPTV services over wireless networks,
several cross-layer designs were presented [4,11,13,14,15].
These cross-layer designs aim to enable interactions between
several protocol layers for achieving better performance. For
example, according to the results in [1,3,7,8,9], the QoS of
video transmission over a wireless network was shown to be
further improved based on the cross-layer information.
The authors of [7] proposed an adaptive cross-layer protection
strategy for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of
scalable video transmission. Their scheme is based on
evaluating different error control and adaptation mechanisms
available in the different layers for robust transmission of
video, namely MAC retransmission strategy, application-
layer FEC, bandwidth-adaptive compression using scalable
coding, and adaptive packetization strategies. In [3], an
adaptive cross-layer fragmentation scheme was proposed to
provide a reliable and QoS-based IPTV service delivery over
802.11 WLAN. Their fragmentation approach considers both
the loss ratio and MAC overhead ratio. But it does not take
the random backoff time in IEEE 802.11 WLAN into
consideration. Additionally, based on the observation of RTT
variability, the work in [1] proposed effective adaptive cross-
layer schemes for multimedia delivery over the time-varying
wireless channels, including the MAC layer retry limit, the
application layer FEC control, and selecting a fragment size.
It is well-known that the timing or timestamp information is
mandatory for video streaming services. Thus, the study [8]
presented a deadline-aware scheduling algorithm for video
streaming applications over a wireless shared channel. The
presented method adopts the Decoding Timestamp (DTS) for
calculating the deadline and slows down the transmission of
streams to users with favorate channel conditions until their
deadline is approaching. In [9], the authors proposed a time-
based adaptive retry (TAR) mechanism for MPEG-like video
streaming over 802.11 wireless networks. TAR dynamically
determines whether to send or discard a packet based on its
retransmission deadline instead of adopting a static retry limit.
The retransmission deadline for each video packet is
determined based on the temporal relationship and error
propagation characteristics of different video frames.
Based on the researches mentioned above, it is extremely
necessary to adapt the MAC fragment size to the time-varying
wireless channel conditions. In addition, for IPTV service
delivery over the wireless networks the stringent delay and
jitter constraints should be met, since the video frames
violating their presentation deadlines will be dropped (i.e.,
lateness loss) at the receiver. Undoubtedly, the presentation
deadlines of all video frames must be considered in the cross-
layer design for improving the video playout quality.
Consequently, in this paper we will propose a cross-layer
design which takes both the MAC fragment size and the
presentation deadline into consideration.

channel.

3 Numerical results
In this section, we employ computer simulations to verify the
proposed cross-layer design. We use network simulator 2
(NS2) [16] to conduct the simulations for the wired network
from the video server to the streaming agent, as shown in Fig.
1. The wired network topology in Fig. 3 is adopted for our
simulations. In Fig. 3, nodes 1 to 4 denote the routers, while
node 0 and node 5 are the video server and the streaming
agent, respectively. The wired network simulations are to
generate various network jitters for the video packets. As to
the wireless network, we implement the IEEE 802.11 MAC
protocol by using the C++ program. And we restrict our study
to the DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) access mode
in this paper. In addition, all wireless traffic is in the
downlink path, i.e., from the streaming agent to the wireless
receiver, and no other uplink traffic exists in our simulations
except the ACK frames. Furthermore, we will ignore the
effects of FEC, either in the APP layer or in the MAC layer.
At first, we use simulations to find the optimal fragment sizes
for MAC frames under different channel bit error rates. We
intend to find the relationship between the fragment size and
the normalized throughput at the MAC layer (not including
the MAC header) under various bit error rates. Hence, we
assume that the streaming agent is fully loaded and always
has IP packets for transmission. The length of each IP packet
is assumed to be 1500 bytes. The other related simulation
parameters used for 802.11 WLAN are listed in Table 1. Fig.
4 shows the normalized throughput versus the fragment size
under different bit error rates. From Fig. 4, one can observe
that if the fragment size is small, e.g., less than 200 bytes, the
MAC protocol overhead ratio will be large so that the
throughput becomes low. When the bit error rate e is 510 ,
the throughput increases with the fragment size initially and
then becomes almost saturated. But if the bit error rate e is
greater than 5105  , the throughput may degrade at larger
fragment sizes. Therefore, under a low bit error rate channel
condition, it is not necessary to fragment an IP packet. But
under a high bit error rate channel condition, the IP packets
are required to be fragmented, e.g., the optimal fragment size
is about 200 bytes when the bit error rate is 410 according to
Fig. 4.
Table 1: Simulation parameters for IEEE 802.11 WLAN
Figure 4: The behavior of the normalized throughput versus
the fragment size under various bit error rates.
Next, we will evaluate the performance of our proposed
cross-layer design in IEEE 802.11 WLAN. The wireless
channel is assumed to be time-varying and is modelled by a
two-state Markov chain [2] given by Fig. 2. The bit error rate
in the G state is assumed to be 510 , while it equals 410 in
the B state. According to Fig. 4, the optimal fragment sizes in
the G and B states can be set to be 1500 bytes and 200 bytes,
respectively. The transition rates and in Fig. 2 are set to
30 1sec and 10 1sec [2], respectively. In our simulations, we
use the MPEG-4 encoded video, Jurassic Park I [17], as the
video streaming source. This MPEG-4 video is VBR and has
average bit rate 770 kbps, and the frame rate of this MPEG-4
video is 25 fps. That is, the PTSs are evenly spaced by 40 ms.
All video frames are transmitted from the video server (node
0) to the streaming agent (node 5), and are jittered by the
cross-traffic when they traverse the wired network. The
Pareto ON-OFF traffic type with parameters (burst time, idle
time) = (400 ms, 600 ms) is chosen as the cross-traffic. In our
8. Again, the performance of our proposed cross-layer design
is much better than that of the conventional scheme in terms
of the APP layer goodput, as described in the first scenario.
Thus, we conclude that our proposed cross-layer scheme
based on the presentation deadline is an outstanding design.

4 Conclusions
This article introduces a cross-layer design which uses the
PTSs of RTP packets to decide whether to send a MAC frame
over the WLAN or not. At the streaming agent, each MAC
frame can be sent over the wireless network only when the
presentation deadline can be met and the number of
retransmissions is not over the retry limit. In addition, the
optimal fragment sizes for MAC frames under different
channel error rates are studied by simulations. Based on the
results, in our cross-layer design different MAC frame sizes
are adopted under different channel conditions. Numerical
results show that the proposed cross-layer design can achieve
a better APP layer goodput for IPTV services. In addition, our
proposed cross-layer design can avoid a waste of wireless
channel resources on serving useless MAC frames which will
be dropped at the receiver due to missing their presentation
deadlines.
