1. Introduction 
A thulium fiber laser, pumped near 790 nm and populated at the 3F4 level by cross relaxation 
to lase at 1.8-2.1 m is known to have excellent slope efficiency with respect to the pump 
power. In addition to the well-focused Yb3+ fiber laser at 1-1.1 m, the Tm3+-doped fiber laser 
has shown potential as an alternative for high-power fiber lasers that approach kilowatt levels. 
Despite the relatively small output power to date as compared to the ytterbium fiber laser, the 
Tm3+ fiber laser emits in the eye-safe wavelength range that is more preferable for pulsing 
operations. Most pulsed thulium fiber lasers reported in the literature to date were mode-
locked lasers using semiconductor saturable-absorber mirrors (SESAM) [1-4]. The mode-
locked pulses generally had a pulse energy of 0.5 to 4 nJ and a pulse duration of hundreds of 
femtoseconds. Higher pulse energy at lower pulse repetition rates could be achieved via use of 
Q-switching technology. Bulk Tm-doped YLF and YAG lasers were Q-switched at 2 m with 
active acousto-optic modulators (AOM) [5-7] and passive saturable absorbers such as 
Ho:YLF, Ho:CaF2, and Cr:ZnSe [8-10]. Although these bulk Q-switches could also be 
employed in a thulium fiber resonator, the alignment of the bulk components with the fiber is 
relatively sophisticated and usually results in large coupling losses. Recently, Q-switching in 
the Tm all-fiber laser near 2 m was achieved through polarization modulation using PZT-
induced stress on a thulium fiber [11], and by use of a Ho3+ doped saturable-absorber fiber 
[12]. The holmium-doped fiber is currently the only fiber-type saturable absorber Q-switch 
(SAQS) for the thulium fiber laser. Although Q-switching in an all-fiber laser using a SAQS 
fiber is a direct, most economic and compact approach, an efficient SAQS fiber is difficult to 
find and is generally restricted to a certain laser medium that operates within a narrow 
wavelength range. 
An attractive alternative approach for producing 2-m laser pulses is to gain-switch a 
thulium fiber resonator by pulsed pump. The energy transition between the levels 3H6 and 3F4 
of Tm3+ provides a broad emission band from 1.6 to 2 m and an absorption band from 1.5 to 
1.9 m. Ideally, a gain-switched thulium laser could emit pulses within a very broad favorable 
band from 1.75 to 2 m where the emission strength is larger than the absorption strength. 
Thulium fiber lasers were gain-switched at 2 m using external pulsed pump of a 1064-nm 
Nd:YAG laser [13,14] and a 1914-nm Tm:YLF crystal laser [15]. Although gain-switching 
seemed to be a convenient method, an obvious drawback is the need of an efficient pulsed 
pump source that is usually a Q-switched laser. In addition, due to the close energy gaps and 
complex cross relaxations between the multiple excited states of Tm3+ involved in 1064-nm 
pumping, the gain-switched pulse shapes were chaotic and non-reproducible. 
Recently, we have demonstrated an erbium all-fiber laser that is passively Q-switched 
with a thulium fiber at 1570 nm [16]. The laser was soon realized in a cladding-pumped large-
core erbium fiber system by Kurkov et al. to achieve a higher average output power [17]. It is 
interesting to notice that the transition between 3H6 and 3F4 of Tm3+ has a negligible emission 
cross section below 1.57 m and a negligible absorption cross section above 1.95 m. 
Therefore, an efficient Q-switching operation (i.e., full absorption saturation) by thulium at 
The pulsing characteristics were detected by a biased InGaAs photodetector, i.e., ET5000 
manufactured by Electro-Optics Tech., and monitored by an Agilent Infiniium 1-GHz 
oscilloscope, as shown in Fig. 2. The rise times of the photo-detector and the oscilloscope 
were about 35 and 350 ps, respectively. The spectral response of the photo-detector at 1.95 
m was 1.6 times the response at 1.57 m. The pulse duration of the 1570-nm Q-switched 
pulse was about 70 ns, which indicated an efficient Q-switching and full populating of Tm3+ 
onto the excited state 3F4 after each Q-switched pulse. The subsequent gain-switched envelope 
contained tens of mode-locked pulses with about 100% modulation depth and a period of 102 
ns which was consistent with the roundtrip time of the 10-m resonator length. Specifically, 
one main pulse and 3 to 5 satellite pulses occurred in one round trip. As indicated in Fig. 2(b), 
in a scale of 10 ns, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main pulse was about 2 ns. 
The spectrum of the output pulses was measured via an Oriel Cornerstone monochromator 
and a Thorlab PbS pre-amplified detector. The data was calibrated according to the spectral 
response of the PbS detector and normalized as shown in Fig. 3. The two signal peaks 
occurred at the designated central wavelengths of the FBGs, i.e., 1570 and 1950 nm. By 
removing the 1950-nm FBG coupler of 30%R, the 1950-nm signal in the spectrum and the 
gain-switched envelope on the oscilloscope were no longer observed and the system became a 
simple passively Q-switched 1570-nm erbium laser.

thulium laser was self mode-locked at 1950 nm with full modulation depth and a constant pulse 
period of 102 ns that was consistent with the roundtrip time of a 10-meter resonator.

bandwidths of 1 nm.  
3. Conclusion 
This paper demonstrates a novel passively gain-switched and self mode-locked thulium 
all-fiber laser at 1950 nm. In this design, the Tm3+-doped fiber in a gain-switched fiber laser 
also acted as the Q-switch in a coupled erbium fiber resonator pumped with a 980-nm 
continuous-wave laser diode. Self mode-locked pulses in a 1950-nm gain-switched envelope 
with 100% modulation depth were observed for the first time. The physics was attributed to 
the ESA and instant full populating of Tm3+ on the excited state 3F4 after a 1570-nm Q-
switched pulse. When using two HR FBGs of 1-nm reflection bandwidths, a mode-locked 
pulse with pulse duration of 720 ps and peak power of 430 W was achieved.
