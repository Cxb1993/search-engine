1. Introduction 
 Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS’s) represent an alternative technology 
to traditional crane-based systems for automated unit load storage and retrieval (S/R) operations. In place 
of aisle-captive storage cranes, these systems rely on autonomously operating vehicles that can move 
between any pair of storage rack addresses. Subject to vehicles’ reliance on slow moving lifts for vertical 
transport, this feature enables designers to control system throughput capacity within a fixed storage rack 
by adjusting the number of vehicles. Like other automation technologies for unit load S/R operations, 
AVS/RS’s have relatively high capital costs favoring the use of space conserving policies such as random 
storage which minimizes total space requirements by enabling different loads to occupy the same storage 
address at different times. However, the cycle time inflation effects of vertical movement in AVS/RS’s 
makes the tradeoffs associated with class-based versus random storage more attractive relative to other 
automation technologies for unit load systems. This follows from the fact that class-based policies can 
retain much of the space efficiency of random storage while eliminating and/or reducing the vertical 
travel component of cycle times for the highest turnover loads in a system. These considerations suggest 
the need for analytical tools capable of modeling the influence of alternative class-based storage policies 
on AVS/RS cycle times. 
 The purpose of the current study is to propose computationally efficient, accurate and flexible 
procedures for cycle time modeling in AVS/RS’s using class-based storage. These procedures must be 
computationally efficient to assist the creative search process by enabling easy evaluation of diverse 
combinations of system design profiles and operating scenarios in an application where decision making 
costs and risks are likely to warrant broad and extensive enumeration of the problem design space. They 
must be accurate enough to justify the narrowing of this design space to identify a reduced subset of 
design profiles worthy of more detailed and costly simulation-based validation. They must be flexible 
enough to facilitate “what-if” analyses where perturbations in class storage schemes can be evaluated to 
help make intelligent tradeoffs between storage policies. To attain these attributes, a network queuing 
approach is proposed that is capable of enumerative evaluation of AVS/RS design alternatives using 
class-based storage. 
 In the next section, background information on AVS/RS’s and class-based storage policies is 
provided. Building on these ideas, the third section presents a network queuing approach for predicting 
cycle times and resource utilization levels in AVS/RS’s as a function of total storage capacity 
requirements, the storage rack configuration, and the transactions demand level. A simulation-based 
validation study of the model is presented in the fourth section along with an application of the model 
illustrating the AVS/RS system conceptualization process. The final section offers a summary and 
conclusions. 
2. Background Information 
 AVS/R is a relatively new technology for automated unit load storage systems where S/R operations 
are performed by autonomously operating vehicles capable of accessing any storage address in a system, 
[Zizzi 2000]. Vehicles move in rectilinear flow paths on rail guides built into each tier of a storage rack. 
Vertical movement is facilitated by lifts mounted along the periphery of the rack. The basic design 
features of AVS/RS technology are detailed in, [Malmborg 2002, 2003]. Illustrations of major system 
components are summarized in Figure 1. The dominant cost associated with AVS/RS technology is 
3 
tiers 5-10 define class 3, etc. This approach reduces average cycle times versus random storage by 
eliminating and/or reducing the level of vertical movement in the most active loads. It conserves storage 
space relative to dedicated policies since random storage is used within classes. The degree to which 
cycle times are reduced depends on the “skew” of the load turnover distribution which can be 
conveniently described using a fit parameter, (denoted s, 0≤s≤1), defining the cumulative percentage of 
flow for all loads in an AVS/RS. This procedure is analogous to an “ABC” curve in an inventory system. 
For example, if storage class 1 represents 10% of all loads in a system and explains 90% of the total 
transactions demand, the corresponding fit parameter for this “10/90 ABC curve” would be given by 
solving the equation G(j)=js or 0.9 = 0.1s, yielding s=0.0458. Smaller values of s correspond to higher 
skews and relatively greater cycle time reductions for class-based storage policies relative to pure random 
storage. 
The use of a single parameter to estimate the load turnover distribution in an AVS/RS can be 
useful in the process of system conceptualization where designers attempt to predict key aspects of 
AVS/RS performance including expected cycle time, storage space requirements, throughput capacity and 
S/R device response time. A typical conceptualization scenario involves preliminary information 
gathering followed by the evaluation of a wide range of design profiles specifying major system features 
including the storage rack configuration, (number of storage aisles, columns and tiers), and the vehicle 
and lift fleet sizes. The ability to efficiently and accurately predict the performance of AVS/RS’s is a 
major technical challenge and business requirement for system suppliers. 
Expected cycle time is perhaps the single most important measure of system performance. Cycle 
times directly influence vehicle response time and resource utilization levels. Cycle time is distinct from 
throughput capacity which is based on the number of vehicles and lifts, and the average time required for 
the most efficient type of S/R cycle. Vehicle utilization is a particularly useful performance measure in 
the conceptualization process for guiding designers in identifying cost effective system profiles. It is a 
measure that can readily identify system profiles having adequate operating capacity and slack for a given 
level of S/R transactions demand and total storage capacity, [Malmborg 2001]. Since AVS/RS’s of 
practical size can store up to 50,000 individual loads, the number of design profiles examined in a 
conceptualization study aimed narrowing the solution space to a relatively small set of design profiles 
worthy of detailed simulation-based validation can easily reach several hundred thousand. Therefore, 
there exists a need for computationally efficient analytical tools capable of accurately predicting expected 
cycle times and resource utilization levels in AVS/RS’s as a function of the variables defining a design 
profile, i.e., the number of storage aisles, columns and tiers, and the vehicle and lift fleet sizes. The next 
section proposes a cycle time model for AVS/RS conceptualization designed to have these attributes. 
 
 
3. An AVS/RS Cycle Time Model for Class-Based Storage Systems 
 As described in the previous section, class boundaries in AVS/RS’s are likely to be defined as 
individual storage tiers or groups of storage tiers. In this section, a cycle time model is proposed for such 
systems based on the following assumptions: 
1. Combination of complete storage tiers are used in defining storage classes and random storage is used 
within classes. 
5 
(α,β,γ)  Probability: 
S,I,t  PSIt = [λR/(λR+λS)] [λS/(λR+λS)] pi, t=1…T 
S,F,t  PSFt = [(λS/(λR+λS))p1] [(λS/(λR+λS))pi], t=1…T 
S,N,t  PSFt = [(λS/(λR+λS))(1-p1)] [(λS/(λR+λS))pi], t=1…T 
R,I,t  PRIt = [λR/(λR+λS)] [λS/(λR+λS)] pi, t=1…T 
R,S,t PRSt = [(λS/(λR+λS))pi] [(λS/(λR+λS))pi], t=1…T 
R,N,t  PRNt = [(λS/(λR+λS))(1-pi)] [(λS/(λR+λS))pi], t=1…T 
 
These probabilities are based on the control sequences associated with each transaction type and the 
class-based, random-within-class storage policy. For example: 
PRSt = (prob. of vehicle seizure in the tier t rack) x (prob. of retrieval address on tier t). 
Given the probability distribution of these travel scenarios, corresponding travel times can be applied to 
obtain the expected lift cycle time. To do this, it is necessary to apply expected values of lift travel 
distances based on the transaction type. For travel scenarios (S,I,t=2…T) and (S,F,t=2…T), a lift travels 
from the tier of the last service completion to the I/O point and then transports a vehicle to the destination 
tier with a corresponding travel distance of: 
E(D1) = Σt=2…T(t-1)ptY/(1-p1), 
where the probabilities are normalized by (1-p1) to exclude cases of vehicles located on the first tier. 
Using similar reasoning, for travel scenario (S,N,1), the corresponding expected lift travel distance 
between tiers is given by: 
E(DBS)= Σs=2…TΣt=2…T│s-t│ps ptY/(1-p1), 
where s indicates the lift tier position, and t indicates the vehicle tier position. Given these movement 
elements, the lift service times associated with the various classes of storage transactions can be obtained 
by adding the distance for travel to the final destination tier (t-1)Y where applicable, and then applying 
the vertical travel velocity as follows: 
 (α,β,γ)   Expected Travel Time(ELαβγ): 
SI1, SF1  0 – no lift service 
SIt for t=2…T  [E(D1)+(t-1)z]/vv
SFt for t=2…T [E(D1)+(t-1)z]/vv
SN1   [E(DBS)+E(D1)]vv
SNt for t=2…T [E(DBS)+E(D1)+(t-1)z]/vv 
 
With retrieval transactions, lift distances between any pair of tiers can be described using: 
E(DBR)= Σs=2…TΣt=2…T│s-t│ps ptz, 
with the expected distance from tier t to any tier in the system given by: 
E(DBt)= Σs=2…T│s-t│psz/(1-pt), 
where probabilities are normalized by (1-pt) to exclude cases where lifts are located on the same tier as 
the requesting vehicle. Subsequently, lift service times associated with various classes of retrieval 
transactions can be formulated by adding vertical movement components and the waiting time for 
vehicles to complete retrieval operations, and then applying the travel velocity parameters to obtain: 
(α,β,γ)   Expected Travel Time (ELαβγ): 
7 
associated with using mean value analysis to compute W(V) by enabling the p(j,V-1) probabilities to be 
defined as p(j) steady state probabilities and calculated by solving: 
p(j)= [(λRPRV+λSPSV)/(φ(j)μL]p(j-1) for j=1,…,V-1 with Σj=0…V-1p(j)=1, 
 
where φ(j)=j if j<l and L if j≥L. This yields: 
 
p(0)=[1 + Σi=1…L-1{λi/Πj=1…i φ(j)μL + λL/Πj=1…i φ(j)μL(1-(λ/LμL)V-L)/(1-(λ/LμL))}]-1, 
 
where λ is equal to λRPRV+λSPSV. 
 Given the approximation of W(V) noted above, it follows that the vehicle waiting time for a lift can 
be approximated using WqL=W(V)-1/μL. This estimate from the vehicle/lift queuing system can be 
applied in the analysis of the transaction/vehicle queuing system where the arrival rate is simply λT=λS+λR. 
The service rate is based on a total of 6T transaction scenarios where service times can be formulated as 
follows: 
(α,β,γ)   Expected Travel Time (EVαβγ): 
SI1    (D/2+W/2)/vh
SIt for t=2…T  WqL+[E(D1)+(t-1)z]/vv+(D/2+W/2)/vh
SF1    2(D/2+W/2)/vh
SFt for t=2…T WqL+[E(D1)+(t-1)z]/vv+2(D/2+W/2)/vh
SN1    WqL+E(D1)/vv+2(D/2+W/2)/vh
SNt for t=2…T WqL+[E(D1)+(t-1)z]/vv+2(D/2+W/2)/vh
 
Applying these values with the corresponding probability distribution and ignoring load transfer times 
yields the expected transaction service time as E(T) = ΣαΣβΣγ PαβγEVαβγ and transaction service rate 
μT=1/E(T). Subsequently, the transaction-vehicle queuing system can be modeled as an M/G/V with 
estimates of transaction waiting times obtainable through the application of Whitt’s approximation, 
[Whitt 1983], for non-Poisson service times where the above probability distribution of service times is 
applied to compute the squared coefficient of variation. The next section reports on empirical validation 
studies aimed at testing the cycle time model for AVS/RS’s using class-based storage policies. 
4. Empirical Studies Using the Class Storage Cycle Time Model 
 To assess the accuracy with which the model described in the previous section estimates cycle times 
in class-based storage systems, a simulation model of an AVS/RS is programmed in C and used to 
simulate a wide range of operating scenarios and design profiles differentiated by the storage rack 
configuration, the number of storage classes, the vehicle and lift fleet sizes, the transaction demand rate, 
and the transactions demand skew. A total of 49,920 scenarios are simulated based on the variable and 
parameter ranges defined by: 
Variable/Parameter:   Values Simulated: 
 T 4 (K=2,4), 6 (K=2,4,8), 12 (K=2,3,4,6,12), 16 (K=2,4,8) tiers/classes, 
 A 5,10,15,20 aisles, 
 C 25,50,75,100 storage columns, 
 L 1,2,3,4,5 lifts, 
9 
relatively more transactions are completed without lift service since they tend to be concentrated in 
storage class 1 on the first tier.  Results in Figure 4 illustrate that 90% of the percentage differences 
observed in vehicle utilization between the model-generated and simulation-generated results vary from 
approximately -1.5% to +3.0% for the 20/80 demand skew, and -3.0% to +3.0% for the 5/95 demand 
skew. Analogous results for transaction cycle times from Figure 5 are -2.0% to +2.0% for the 20/80 
demand skew, and -3.0% to 0% for the 5/95 demand skew. Earlier studies have argued that errors of this 
magnitude are generally acceptable for design conceptualization purposes with automated unit load 
storage systems, [Eldemir et al., 2003, Bozer and Cho 2005]. Overall, the results in Figures 3-5 strongly 
suggest that the network queuing model produces sufficiently accurate estimates of system performance 
measures for AVS/RS design conceptualization. 
 To illustrate the application of the model in a design conceptualization context, a problem of realistic 
size in terms of total storage capacity is analyzed in detail. Specifically, alternative system configurations 
for AVS/RS’s designed to accommodate N=2ACT=30,720 loads are examined by computing system 
performance measures for 17 alternative system configurations including: 
{A=16, C=60, T=16, K=1,2,4,8,16} 
{A=20, C=64, T=12, K=1,2,4,6,12} 
{A=24, C=80, T=8, K=1,2,4,8} 
{A=32, C=120, T=4, K=1,2,4}. 
 
Setting L=4, V=8, λS=λR=1.0/minute, and holding the remaining parameter values at their levels from the 
previous study, the model outputs for the four system configurations under demand skews of 50/50, 20/80 
and 5/95 are presented in Table 2 with respect to the key system conceptualization measures of 
transaction cycle time (E(T)), vehicle utilization (UV), and transaction waiting time (Wq). As expected, 
cycle times and vehicle utilization levels remain fixed under each storage rack configuration for the 50/50 
demand skew, (s=1), reflecting the fact that class-based storage has no cycle time advantage over random 
storage when loads have identical turnover distributions.  Similarly, cycle times and corresponding 
vehicle utilization values are reduced as the number of storage classes increases within each rack 
configuration for the 20/80 and 5/95 demand skews with the magnitude of this effect greatest under the 
5/95 scenario. The results in Table 2 also illustrate the effect of the “square-in-time” design principle in 
automated unit load storage systems, [Bozer and White, 1984]. That is, travel efficiencies are greatest 
when the shape of the storage rack is such that the maximum travel times in each dimension are roughly 
equal. This is evident from the fact that storage configurations with very deep aisles, i.e., C=120, are the 
least efficient with respect to vehicle travel. In practice, design conceptualization results similar to those 
in Table 2 might be applied to identify the most cost-efficient design profiles that are site-feasible for a 
given application and yield acceptable resource utilization levels under all plausible operating scenarios. 
5. Summary and Conclusions 
  A cycle time model is proposed for AVS/RS applications where class-based storage policies may be 
used to mitigate the cycle time inflation effects of vertical storage while maintaining most of the space 
efficiency of random storage. The model is designed specifically for the practice of AVS/RS design 
conceptualization by utilizing a network queuing approach capable of efficiently generating estimates of 
AVS/RS resource utilization based on alternative class-based storage schemes and the key decision
