the pre-charge stage the input voltage will cause the power 
MOS transistor Q1 to turn-on. The presence of small turn-on 
resistance (Rds-on) inside power MOS transistor Q1 draws 
significant amount of current through the inductor. This large 
amount of current can cause damage to the internal circuitry. 
To alleviate this problem, pre-charge function must be 
included to condition the current. The pre-charge circuit 
(highlighted in red) enables the power MOS transistor Q2 to 
stabilize the charge current to the output terminal. When the 
output voltage is approximately 3.6V the switch will turn on to 
the second stage and the soft start function is performed. At 
this stage the large current through the power MOS is reduced.

(2)Soft start circuit: When the circuit is switch to the second 
stage the soft-start function is performed. The supply voltage, 
VBAT, charges the capacitor, C1, through MSW1 and MP1. 
Capacitor C1 produces a ramp signal which is compared to a 
sawtooth waveform to generate a gradually increasing pulse 
width signal that will drive the power MOS transistor Q1. 
With this generated pulse width modulated signal the output 
voltage rises to the desired value gradually. In this paper the 
soft-start circuit is controlled by power MOS transistor with a 
limited current of 450mA.

B. Voltage mode pulse width modulation technology 
The pulse width modulation signal, which controls the gate 
voltage of the power MOS is taken from the output voltage 
through a feedback network. The feedback signal is compared 
to the reference voltage which produces an error signal. The 
error signal is then compared to a sawtooth waveform. The 
error signal changes when there is a presence of instability in 
the input voltage as well as change in output voltage. The 
PWM modulation uses fixed frequency to improve power 
conversion efficiency. Below show in Figure 5 is voltage mode 
pulse width modulation diagram. 
 
 
Fig.  5.  Voltage mode pulse width modulation diagram. 
C. Current-limited pulse frequency modulation technology 
  Pulse frequency modulation signal draws part of its signal 
from the output terminal through the voltage feedback. The 
feedback signal is compared to a reference voltage which will 
produce an error signal. The error signal is feed into the 
hysteresis comparator generation output signal. During pulse 
frequency modulation, when the power MOS transistor Q1 
turns on inductor current charges. Due to the small on-
resistance of the power MOS transistor Q1, it allows a large 
inductor current to flow through the transistor which causes 
damage to it. Therefore, the need of the detection circuit to 
limit the inductor current is important [4] [5].  
In PFM mode operation, as the load changes due to different 
operating frequency changes the inductor energy storage will 
also vary. Hence, the need for a fixed closing time method to 
transfer all the energy storage of inductor to output terminal is 
highly important. 
In PWM mode fixed switching frequency operation, the 
presence of light load demands relatively low current and will 
increase the number of additional switches thus reduce the 
conversion efficiency. While in PFM mode of operation, light 
loads increases the whole conversion efficiency. Figure 6 
below shows the current-limiting pulse frequency modulation 
diagram.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a synchronous boost regulator with 
PWM/PFM mode operation is presented. This boost regulator 
improves the efficiency of non-synchronous regulator. One of 
its features present is the two-level soft-start circuit. The soft-
start circuit can effectively limit the start-up large inrush 
current during start-up. Also, this paper utilizes current-
limiting circuit technology to effectively limit the current, 
when operating in PFM mode. Finally, the efficiency of the 
boost regulator is more than 90%.

II. CIRCUIT STRUCTURE 
Figure 4 shows the whole circuit structure of the system. It 
is basically composed of integrator, inverter (digital), resistors 
and power MOS. It can be subdivided into two parts; upper 
and lower part. As shown in Fig. 4, the above portion of the 
dotted red line is called the upper part while below it is the 
lower part. Both the upper and lower part utilizes an integrator 
which acts as an input error amplifier. The output waveform of 
the integrator is a triangle signal mix with input audio signal 
from the output of PWM inverter.

FIG. 4. WHOLE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM. 
 
A. Integrator Amplifier 
Figure 5 shows the circuit diagram of the integrator. It is 
composed of operational amplifier, capacitor, and resistors. Its 
function is to transfer the input signals to output triangular 
signal combined with the input audio signal. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Upper and Lower Integrator. 
 
The output signal of the whole class-D system is passed to 
the integrator through a resistor to create a negative feedback 
loop. These integrators also play a pre-amplifier role to get 
enough gain to be used for the whole class-D system. 
The total output transfer function of integrator is defined as:

As can be seen in Fig. 4, the upper part clock signal shows 
inverse relationship relative to lower part clock signal. The 
purpose of this is to make the integrators output triangular 
signal inverse with each other. 
B. PWM Inverter 
The output signal of the integrator is feed to the input node 
of PWM inverter. For instance, when the input signal of the 
PWM inverter in dotted blue line of Fig. 4 is higher than VTH 
the output voltage is zero. When the input signal is lower than 
VTH the output voltage is VDD. Fig. 6 shows the DC transfer 
characteristics of the upper and lower PWM inverter. Base 
from this, we can get the PWM signal from the output of 
PWM inverter.

The PWM inverter on the upper part of Fig. 4 contains more 
than one inverter circuit compare to the lower part. This is to 
ensure the PWM signal of the two PWM inverters to get in-
phase behavior when the input audio signal is zero. Moreover, 
figure 10 shows the triangle and PWM waveform when input 
audio signal is zero. This can be seen in Fig. 10. Fig. 8 and 9 
shows the behavior of the differential triangle signal with 
increasing audio & PWM signal. Furthermore, as the input 
audio signal increases the upper PWM signal’s pulse width 
will increase while the lower PWM’s pulse width decreases.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
We utilized H-spice software tool to prove the circuit. The 
circuit is implemented through TSMC’s 2P4M 0.35μm CMOS 
process. We used a simple resistor and inductor in series to 
model a sample speaker and measure the current flow. The 
speaker resistance value is typically 8 Ω, and the inductance 
value is around 15uH. Fig. 13 shows the simulation result of 
an output current with 10 KHz sine waveform through H-spice. 
Fig. 14 shows the output node signal of upper and lower part 
integrators. It is a triangle signal mixed with sine wave. Fig. 
15 shows the upper and lower output PWM signal of whole 
class-D when the upper part pulse width is increasing then the 
lower part is decreasing to achieve the modulation scheme. 
Fig. 16 shows the efficiency versus the output power with 10 
KHz input sine wave signal. Fig. 17. shows the total harmonic 
distortion versus input audio frequency band signal.

CONCLUSIONS 
A class D audio power amplifier with filter-less output 
using ternary pulse width modulation is presented in this paper. 
Elimination of the output filter can relax the PCB area, and 
reduce the phase delay in the output filter. This modulation 
scheme has the advantages of having high power-conversion 
efficiency, and low output dc static current.
