2. Introduction 
Cobalt base superalloy is well suitable 
materials for use in dramatic temperature 
change and corrosion environments, and is 
therefore widely used in such applications as 
the International Space Station, turbine 
blades, combustor lines in gas turbine 
engines, and nuclear reactors equipment[1, 
2]. The strengthening mechanism of Cobalt 
base superalloys are mainly by utilizing the 
carbide precipitates, such as M6C and M23C6, 
and solid solution strengthening elements, 
such as W, Mo, and Ta [3]. However, the 
high temperature strength and ductility of 
these Cobalt base superalloys are inferior to 
those of nickel base superalloys. Recently, 
the literatures [4] reported that a ternary 
compound Co3Al, Co3Ta and Co3Ti with L12 
structure was developed. The novel cobalt 
base superalloys strengthened by high 
volume fractions of the L12 compound leads 
high mechanical properties, superior 
hot-corrosion and wear resistance compared 
with nickel base superalloys for the 
applications in severe environments. In 
general, the flow stress in engineering 
materials increases with increasing strain 
rate, but decreases with increasing 
temperature. The effects of strain rate or 
temperature the particular material are 
important. Previous literatures have shown 
that the rate of dislocation multiplication and 
the dislocation structures themselves are 
highly sensitive not only to the deformation 
temperature and strain rate, but also to the 
original crystal structure of the material [5, 
6]. In general, the rate of dislocation 
multiplication increases with increasing 
strain rate or reducing temperature and leads 
to an improved material strength [7]. This 
study investigates the effects of the addition 
of titanium and aluminum on the mechanical 
properties and microstructural evolution of 
cobalt base superalloy and the flow stress 
behaviors of the superalloy at different 
temperatures. The microstructures of the 
tested specimens are examined using 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
The stress-strain relation and the evolution 
of the microstructure are discussed for each 
of the considered test conditions  
3. Experimental Procedure and 
Material Preparation 
　 The cobalt base superalloys were 
prepared in a vacuum arc melted furnace. 
The mass chemical composition of the 
cobalt base superalloy (as measured by a 
glow discharge spectrometer (GDS)) are 17 
Cr, 9 Ni, 13 W, 1.2 Mn, 0.04 C, and the 
balance Co, with different contents of Ti and 
Al,  and it was shown in Table 1. The 
solution heat treatment of the ingots was 
carried out at 1300℃ for 2 h in a vacuum 
furnace. Then they were then aged at 680℃ 
for 4 h and at 850℃ for 20 h and poured 
into a heated permanent metal mold. Then 
an indirect extrusion machine forms bars 
with dimensions of 13 mm x 700 mm 
(diameter x length). Finally, these bars were 
machined into cylindrical specimens with a 
length and diameter of 9.7 mm and the ends 
 3
Since the flow stress of cobalt base 
superalloy is dependent on the strain rate, 
the variation of the flow stress with strain 
rate is dominated by the specific 
rate-controlling deformation mechanism. If 
the strain rate is controlled by a thermally 
activated process with a free energy of 
activation G  , the relationship between 
the flow stress and the strain rate can be 
described by the Arrhenius type equation, 
i.e. 
the semi-logarithmic strain rate at a constant 
true strain. Figures 2(a) show that the 
Co-0.9Ti-0.9Al superalloy for true strains of 
0.1 and 0.2, the flow stress increases with 
increasing strain rates and strain, but 
decreases with increasing temperature. It 
also can be seen the similar results at the 
Co-0.9Ti-0.3Al and Co-0Ti-0Al superalloy 
as shown in Fig.2 (b) and 2(c), respectively. 
However, it also reveals that the cobalt base 
superalloy contains Ti and Al contents has a 
higher value of flow stress for a similarly 
strain rate. It is seen that the flow stress of 
the three cobalt superalloys increase with 
increasing strain rate. The effect of the strain 
rate on the stress can be quantified via the 
strain rate sensitivity parameter β. The strain 
rate sensitivity, β, of the cobalt superalloy 
can be calculated from the experimental data 
presented in Figs. 2(a)-2(c), and the equation 
as showing in following [8]:

where   is the deformation strain rate,  
G  is the activation free energy, k is the 
Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute 
temperature, and the activation volume * . 
The activation volume index provides an 
indication of the evolution of dislocations 
during a plastic deformation process. Using 
the relationship presented in Eq. 2, the 
activation volume, normalized with respect 
to b3 (where b is the Burger vector of cobalt 
superalloy, i.e. 2.5×10-10 m), can be 
presented as a function of the strain, as 
shown in Figs. 4(a)-4(c), respectively. The 
results show that the activation volume 
decreases with increasing strain but 
increases with increasing temperature at the 
similar strain.

where the flow stresses  and 2 1  are

of  and ,respectively, and are 
calculated at the same value of plastic strain. 
Figs. 3(a)-3(c) present the strain rate 
sensitivity of the cobalt base superalloy as a 
function of strain. It can be seen that the 
strain rate sensitivity of the three cobalt base 
superalloys increases with strain rate, but 
decreases with increasing temperature. 
Furthermore, it is also evident that the cobalt 
base superalloy contains Ti and Al contents 
have a higher value of β for a similarly 
deformed temperature and strain rate.

The results suggest that the thermal 
activation effect, which assists dislocations

are higher than cobalt base alloys without Ti 
and Al additions. These observations are 
also consistent with the strain rate and 
temperature effect on the Figs. 1(a)-1(c). 
Furthermore, it is known that cobalt base 
superalloy contains Ti and Al contents, 
which can formation the coherent precipitate 
of Co3(Ti,Al) compound also can enhance 
the strength of the cobalt base superalloy

This study has investigated the quasi-static 
mechanical behaviour and microstructural 
evolution of three cobalt base superalloys at 
strain rates ranging from 10-3 s-1 to 10-1 s-1 
and temperatures of 25~700 ℃ with and 
without Ti and Al contents. The results have 
shown that the flow stress increase with 
increasing strain rate, but decrease with 
increasing temperature. Moreover, it has 
been revealed that under the same 
deformation condition, the cobalt base 
superalloy contains Ti and Al contents has 
high strength than without Ti and Al content. 
As the deformation temperature increases, 
the strain rate sensitivity decreases, but the 
activation volume increases. TEM 
observations have shown that the dislocation 
density increases with increasing strain rate, 
but decreases with increasing temperature. 
The high dislocation density and small 
dislocation cell size result in an increased 
flow stress. Furthermore, the cobalt base 
superalloy has the Ti and Al contents, which 
can formation the coherent compound of 
Co3(Ti,Al) also can enhance the strength of 
the cobalt base superalloy.
