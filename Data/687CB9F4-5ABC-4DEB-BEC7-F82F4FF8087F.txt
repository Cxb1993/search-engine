ABSTRACT 
 
  Two novel waveguide photodiodes (WGPD) 
with absorption layer sandwiched 
symmetrically between Double-Step Double 
Heterojunctions (DSDH, InP-InGaAsP-InGaAs 
-InGaAsP-InP) and between Graded Index 
Separate Confinement Heterostructures 
(GRINSCH, InP- 
In1-xGaxAsyP1-y-InGaAs-In1-xGaxAsyP1-y -InP) 
have been theoretically designed, simulated and 
compared with traditional Single Step Double 
Heterojunction (SSDH) WGPD. As the  
refractive indexes of such heterojunctions is 
between the absorbing layer and InP cap layer, 
the incident light could hence be confined more 
effectively in absorption layer through the 
additional total internal reflection. Furthermore, 
the smoother barriers between InP material and 
InGaAs absorption layer of novel structures at 
the conduction and valance band could lower 
the effective barrier high. As a result, the novel 
WGPDs achieve characteristics of high 
bandwidth and responsivity product at lower 
operating bias. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
  To develop a long-wavelength 
photodiode that simultaneously possesses 
higher quantum efficiency, higher operating 
bandwidth, and higher output current and lower 
noise has been the objective of all R&D staff in 
the fiber-optic communication field for decades. 
According to corresponding literature of 
photodiode [1-3] and in consideration of the 
cost of epitaxy and process, the one that 
simultaneously possesses high quantum 
responsivity and high speed operation potential 
resides in the WGPD. This type of device 
provides reciprocally vertical light absorbing 
path and carrier migration path to overcome the 
trade-off of the frequency and responsivity. 
Furthermore, while the edge-coupled 
photodiode is integrated with the edge emission 
laser or waveguide, the integration and package 
are easier than traditional surface-coupled 
photodiode, and hence the overall cost could be 
further decreased.  
In most literatures until now, in order to 
obtain higher photo responsivity, the waveguide 
and photodiode are integrated to achieve better 
optical fiber coupling efficiency.  The butt 
coupling WGPD [4] that requires secondary 
epitaxy and the evanescent vertical coupling 
WGPD [5] with longer light absorbing layer are 
the most common ones.  The improvement is 
proceeded from the “external” of the 
photodiode in both methods that result in 
epitaxy cost increase, processes complication, 
leakage current and bandwidth property 
deterioration. 
 
Principles of Waveguide Design: 
 
This study aims at developing an 
InP/InGaAs PIN WGPD for communication 
with high responsivity and bandwidth product 
at low voltage.  The MOCVD is used to grow

WGPDs 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The main difference consists in the above 
and below the InGaAs light absorbing layer 
which are respectively clipped by N and P 
Single-Step heterointerfaces (SHIFP and SHIFN) 
in traditional SSDH-WGPD; by N and P 
Double-Step heterointerfaces (DHIFP and 
DHIFN) in DSDH-WGPD; and by N and P 
Graded Index Separate Confinement 
Heterostructure (GRINSCHP and GRINSCHN) 
in GRINSCH-WGPD.  As the energy band 
gap of InP is different from the one of InGaAs 
that leads to the discontinuity of energy band. 
The abrupt heterobarriers will be generated 
between the junctions of traditional 
SSDH-WGPD which result in further 
heterojunction resistance that affects greatly the 
performance of WGPD, especially at low 
operating voltage and high operating current.  
The change on the heterojunction of these two 
new WGPD will smoothen the discontinuity of 
the energy band and further elevate the 
frequency responsivity of the device at low 
bias.  
 
II. Verification of Waveguide Properties 
Simulation:   
 
The OptiBPM software is used 
thereinafter to simulate the waveguide 
properties of the epitaxy structure of these three 
WGPDs in order to confirm that both new 
designed heterointerfaces can effectively 
increase the photo responsivity of WGPD.  
Except for the refractive index generated by 
heterojunction epitaxy structures (Y axis such 
as epitaxy thickness design), all of the 
propagation conditions are the same for these 
three WGPDs, including: propagation depth (Z 
axis) of 10µm, light input facet width (X axis) 
of 5µm, incident wavelength of 1.31µm and the 
spot size at 2.5µm Gaussian wave. The 
simulation results about the wave-guiding 
designs are shown in figure 7.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the incidence beams at the 
absorbing layer (InGaAs) (< 2µm), the 
simulation results show that the relative power 
loss from large to small is traditional 
SSDH-WGPD, DSDH-WGPD and 
GRINSCH-WGPD. This proves that both new 
designed heterointerfaces can effectively 
provide the additional total internal reflection 
(TIR) in the traditional InP cladding layer, then 
reflect back to the absorbing layer and the 
intensity of waveguide propagation is relatively 
increased in the InGaAs absorbing layer.  If 
the absorbing factor (α) of the InGaAs 
absorbing layer is taken into consideration, both 
new heterointerfaces can achieve relatively 
larger photo responsivity under same incident 
conditions.

圖十三主要顯示 GRINSCH-WGPD在不
同光強度下的光響應並與 DSDH-、SSDH- 
WGPDs 相互比較。與 DSDH-WGPD 比較可
發現 GRINSCH-WGPD 在高功率照射之下，
其載子遮蔽效應並不嚴重且即使入射較高功
率的光也不會有入射至吸光區後散一出去而
造成光損失的現象。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
為獲得更佳波導效果，我們利用
OptiBPM軟體模擬 40-120nm間格 10nm厚度
的 GRINSCH。由圖 14 波導糢擬結果可發現
GRINSCH 越厚則波導效果越佳。但是圖 15
的順向電流特性卻發現當 120nm 厚的
GRINSCH-WGPD 卻有較大的切入電壓與較
大的順向電阻。可推測為 GRINSCH 太厚而
造成能帶隙差變化形成不連續而造成。 
圖 16 的漏電流特性可發現 GRINSCH 
120nm厚的 GRINSCH-WGPD 具有較大的漏
電流。可推估為形成 P型的擴散的 GRINSCH
層(濃度約 1.42*1019 cm-3)當太厚時而造成極
多的空乏區離子在與吸收層的界面上，進而
形成內部較高的內建電場。而 GRINSCH 
40nm 厚的 GRINSCH-WGPD 具有近似圖 10
的 DSDH-WGPD的暗電流特性。
