Abstract 
     Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) is electrically conducting in the vertical direction (Z-axis) and 
insulating in the horizontal. ACF looks like paper and consists of thermosetting adhesive, conductive 
particles, and release. The particles are randomly distributed in the compound before processing, forced 
flow in the squeeze flowing during thermo-compression forming processing, and fixed between the bumps 
and pads. The major motive in this research is for the bonding demands of the LCD and soft electrics in the 
fine-pitch, high I/Os, high anti-tensile, high anti-shear, high anti-bending, high anti-fatigue, and high 
reliability. The traditional ACF cannot satisfy these critical requirements. Hence, we will try to design, 
develop and manufacture the multi-layered composite Anisotropic Conductive Film in this project. The 
theoretical, numerical, experiment and processing analysis will be carried out in the scheme. The theoretical 
results will show the formulations of the flowing model and compound prediction system. The numerical 
results will present the yield of multilayer ACF. The experimental results will give the data of compound 
volume fraction. The results of the processing analysis will provide the utilization of the the compound 
prediction system, the reliability analysis, and the failure estimation. The major goal is to enhance the 
performances of the ACF, to increase the life of the production, to characterize the compound of the 
multi-layered composite ACF, and to improve the reliability of the ACF processing. 
Index terms: anisotropic conductive film (ACF), non-conductive adhesive (NCA), multilayer, V-shaped 
curve, failure probability.

A bridging failure occurs when a continuous chain of conductive particles is formed between 
neighboring pads. Mannan et al. [9] proposed a simple box model for estimating the bridging probability 
between neighboring pads. Lin et al. [4] modified this model to take account of the possibility of bridging in 
multiple directions. The bridging model was further enhanced by Lin et al. [12]. According to this enhanced 
model, the bridging failure probability is given by

In the opening analysis, the multilayered ACF is compressed as one layered ACF with the diameter

the bridging analysis, the various layers ACFs (from 1 layer to 6 layers) shown in

particles with the volume fraction f, and the total thickness of the multilayer ACF is fixed in 120 microns. 
Hence, the thickness of the sub-layered ACF can be listed as (1-layer, 120 microns; 2-layers, 60 microns; 
3-layers, 40 microns; 4-layers, 30 microns; 5-layers, 24 microns; 6-layers, 20 microns).

Fig. 2. Illustrative V-shaped curve for ACF probability failure estimation.
that the more realistic treatment of bridging effects in the
enhanced box model improved the yield of the minimum failure
probability and optimal volume fraction estimates compared to
those obtained using the original V-shaped curve method.
Recently, Lin et al. [10] analyzed the effect of the upper-
to-lower-pad-height ratio on the global failure probability of
IC/substrate assemblies packaged using ACF, and they found
that the package yield could be improved by reducing the total
height of the two pad arrays or by utilizing pad arrays with
an equal height. Furthermore, it was shown that the V-shaped
curve method provides an effective means of predicting the
influence of an asymmetrical pad-height distribution on the
yield of the IC/substrate package. In addition to pad-height
asymmetries, the failure probability of ACF packages is also
increased by the presence of misalignments between the upper
and lower pad arrays. However, to the best of the current
authors’ knowledge, the literature lacks any formal investi-
gation into the correlation between the degree of the pack-
age misalignment and the corresponding failure probability.
Accordingly, this paper modifies the original V-shaped curve
method to take account of misalignment effects on the effective
conductive area between opposing pads and the length of
the bridging paths between neighboring upper/lower pad pairs
when computing the opening and bridging failure probabilities,
respectively. It is shown that the modified V-shaped curve
method enables not only the failure probability of the ACF
package to be reliably predicted for any given value of the
pad-array misalignment but also an estimate to be made of the
corresponding optimal ACF volume fraction.
II. FAILURE PREDICTION THEORY
A. Probability Analysis of Local IC/Substrate
Assembly Failure
As described earlier, ACF-packaged IC/substrate assemblies
are liable to two different types of failure, namely, opening
and bridging failures. An opening failure occurs when the
gap between the pads of the IC/substrate assembly contains
an insufficient number of particles to form a conductive path
between them (see Fig. 1). The probability of having n particles
between the pads can be described by the following Poisson
distribution:
PO (n = 0, μo(f)) =
μn0 e
−μ0
n!
∣∣∣∣
n=0
= e−
6l∗2f
π (1)
where μo is the average number of particles between the pads
in the vertical direction, f is the volume fraction of particles
within the ACF resin, l is the side length of the square pads, r is
the radius of the conductive particles, and l∗ is a dimensionless
integer defined as l∗ = [l/2r] (where [ ] is a Gaussian function).
In a previous study by the current group, it was shown that a
density of more than five particles per pad is required to ensure
a reliable electrical contact between the IC and the substrate [3],
[4]. Hence, for a given IC/substrate assembly, the probability of
maintaining an effective electrical contact between the upper
and lower pads can be ensured by specifying the volume
fraction of the ACF compound such that the following condition
is satisfied:
PO(n≤5, μo(f))=

A bridging failure occurs when a continuous chain of conduc-
tive particles is formed between neighboring pads (see Fig. 1).

ing probability between neighboring pads in accordance with

particles.
Lin et al. [3] modified (3) to take account of the possibility
of bridging in multipl directions and showed that the bridging
probability could be more accurately estimated as (4), shown
at the bottom of the page, where μb is the average number of
particles between the pads in the pitch direction; i1, i2, j1, and
j2 are calculation indices; l∗ is a dimensionless integer given by

From an inspection of (14), it can be seen that the global failure
probability of the ACF package varies as a function of the local
particle volume fraction following compression, the conductive
particle size, the pad dimensions, the pad pitch, and the number
of pads in each array.
III. ANALYSIS OF MISALIGNMENT EFFECTS ON
FAILURE PROBABILITY OF ACF PACKAGE
A. Opening Analysis
In evaluating the opening failure probability for the case
where misalignments exist in the X- and Y -directions between
the upper and lower pad arrays in the IC/substrate assembly, it
is necessary to determine the effective conductive area between
the pads in the two arrays (see Fig. 3). Having determined the
effective conductive area, the local and global probabilities of
an opening failure can then be computed using a modified form
of (2) and (10), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, misalignments
in the IC/substrate assembly reduce the effective conductive
area between opposing pads from l2 to (l −Δx)(l −Δy). The
dimensionless effective conductive area can be expressed as
A∗eﬀ =

where Δx and Δy are the misalignment offsets in the X- and
Y -directions, respectively; Δx∗ and Δy∗ are the dimension-
less offsets in the X- and Y -directions, respectively; Aeﬀ is
the effective conductive area; A∗eﬀ is the dimensionless effec-
tive conductive area; and Ex(= (Δx/l) · 100% = (Δx∗/l∗) ·
100%) and Ey(= (Δy/l) · 100% = (Δy∗/l∗) · 100%) are the
offset percentages in the X- and Y -directions, respectively.
To analyze the effects of misalignments in the X- and
Y -directions on the local opening failure probability, (2) is
reformulated as follows:
P
(Ex,Ey)
O (n ≤ 5, μo(f)) =

. (16)
Having computed the local opening probability using (16),
the global opening probability can then be calculated us-
ing (10).
B. Bridging Analysis
Fig. 5 shows the effects of misalignments in the X- and
Y -directions on the four possible bridging paths between neigh-
boring pairs of opposing pads. Clearly, path 1 (UA ↔ UB) and
path 4 (LA ↔ LB) are unaffected by the misalignment between
the upper and lower pads, and thus, the probability of a local
bridging failure along these two paths can be computed using
(5). However, path 2 (UA ↔ LB) is shortened while path 3
(LA ↔ UB) is lengthened as a result of the misalignment, and
thus, (5) no longer applies. The probability of a local bridging
failure in any direction, given a misalignment of the upper and
lower pads in the X-direction, is given by (17), shown at the
bottom of the next page. Note that (17) is derived from (5)
utilizing the horizontal pad separation distance parameter R
(see Fig. 5), which is defined as
R = d±Δx. (18)

package, it is necessary to consider not only the volume fraction
of the ACF compound (f) and the pad-array parameters, i.e.,
l∗, h∗, and d∗, but also the misalignment offsets Ex and Ey .
As discussed in Section IV-A, the opening failure probability is
dominated by the effective conductive area between the oppos-
ing pads in each array, while the bridging failure probability
is dominated by the lengths of the potential bridging paths
between neighboring pairs of opposing pads. Fig. 6 shows
the V-shaped curves for a typical ACF package (see Fig. 7)
subject to various degrees of unidirectional misalignment in the
Y -direction. As discussed earlier in relation to Fig. 2, the
portion of each curve to the left of the turning point represents
the opening probability of the ACF package, while that on the
right of the turning point represents the bridging probability. It
is observed that the optimal volume fraction (i.e., the volume
fraction that yields the minimum failure probability) increases
with an increasing misalignment in the Y -direction. Thus, it
can be inferred that, for a unidirectional misalignment of the
ACF package, misalignments between the upper and lower pad
arrays have a greater effect on the opening failure probability
than on the bridging failure probability. It is observed that, for
values of the misalignment offset Ey that are less than 10%,
the minimum failure probability of the ACF package remains

increased incrementally from 20% to 30%, 40%, and 50%, re-
spectively, the minimum failure probability increases by around
one order (ten times) each time. In other words, the V-shaped
curves move toward the right and in the upward direction as the
degree of unidirectional misalignment is increased.
Fig. 8 shows the V-shaped curves for the ACF package
shown in Fig. 7 for various degrees of misalignment in both
the X- and Y -directions. Comparing the results shown in
Fig. 8 with those in Fig. 6, it is evident that the opening
failure probability increases significantly with an increasing
misalignment, whereas the bridging failure probability remains
relatively unchanged for a given misalignment condition. This
result is to be expected since the offsets of the upper/lower
pads in the bidirectional misalignment are included in the X-
and Y -direction offsets (see Fig. 5). The misalignment in the
bridging circuit causes the upper/lower pads to close (path 2:
R = d−Δx or d−Δy) and separate (path 3: R = d + Δx
or d + Δy) simultaneously. Hence, the effects of bidirectional
misalignments on the bridging probability are qualitatively
similar to those of unidirectional misalignments and should
be considered as synergistic and complementary results in the
failure probabilities of paths 2 and 3.
Fig. 9 shows the turning-point values of the V-shaped curves
shown in Figs. 6 and 8 for uni- and bidirectional misalign-
ments, respectively. Note that the turning points associated with
misalignment conditions other than those shown in the figure
can be determined via a process of linear interpolation. As
discussed previously, the turning point of the V-shaped curve
associated with a specified misalignment condition (Ex, Ey)
represents the optimal design point for the ACF package, i.e.,
the minimum failure probability and the corresponding ACF
volume fraction. It is observed in Fig. 9 that both the failure
probability and the optimal volume fraction increase more
significantly with an increasing bidirectional misalignment

0.15, respectively. Overall, the results show that, even for a per-
fect alignment of the ACF package, i.e., (Ex, Ey) = (0%, 0%),
the failure probability cannot be reduced below a value of
2× 10−3 for a volume fraction of Vf = 0.05 or below 4× 10−6
for a volume fraction of Vf = 0.15.
C. ACF Compound Designation: Volume Fraction Ranges for
Specified Failure Probability
For any given value of the misalignment offset (Ex, Ey), the
V-shaped curve indicates the range of volume fraction which

 10−8, respectively, for different X- and Y -direction misalignment offsets.
limits the failure probability to a value that is less than a
certain predefined value. For example, in Fig. 14, horizontal
line A corresponds to a failure probability of 10−5, and the
corresponding volume fraction ranges that ensure a failure
probability that is lower than this value are indicated in labels
a1−a7 for various values of the ACF package misalignment.
(Note that the V-shaped curves corresponding to misalignments
of (Ex, Ey) = (30%, 30%), (40%, 40%), and (50%, 50%) are
omitted here since their turning points correspond to a failure
probability that is higher than 10−5. In other words, irrespective
of the value assigned to the volume fraction, misalignments of
(Ex, Ey) = (30%, 30%), (40%, 40%), and (50%, 50%) always
exceed the target failure probability value of 10−5 and are
therefore excluded from the figure.) Similarly, dashed line B
corresponds to a failure probability of 10−8. The volume frac-
tion ranges that limit the failure probability to a value that is less
than this target value are indicated in labels b1−b5 for various
values of (Ex, Ey). (Note that offset values of (Ex, Ey) =
(10%, 10%), and (20%, 20%) result in a failure probability that
is greater than 10−8 and are therefore omitted in labels b1−b5.)
As expected, a comparison of the ranges given in a1−a7 with
those given in b1−b5 shows that the degree of latitude in
assigning the volume fraction reduces as the failure probability
requirement becomes more stringent. In practice, the V-shaped
curves have a near-symmetrical form, and thus, in specifying
the ACF volume fraction required to satisfy the specified failure
probability for a given misalignment offset, the midrange value
represents a suitable value since it most closely approximates
the turning point in the curve. In general, misalignments of the
ACF package may arise as a result of machine vibration, an
incorrect positioning of the IC chip relative to the substrate,

I. INTRODUCTION 
Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) has been widely 
used over the past decade for the packaging of Flat Panel 
Displays (FPD), such as Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD), 
and for attaching bare chips to both flexible and rigid 
substrates. ACF consisting of an insulating adhesive matrix 
with a fine dispersion of conductive particles, is used in a 
variety of fine-pitch interconnection methods, including 
Outer Lead Bonding (OLB), flex to PCB bonding (PCB), 
Chip-On-Glass (COG) and Chip-On-Film (COF). In general, 
ACF packages are designed to provide unidirectional 
conductivity in the vertical direction and electrical 
insulation in the pitch direction [1, 2]. Figure 1 presents a 
schematic illustration showing the cross-section of a typical 
IC / substrate assembly packaged using ACF. However, the 
inappropriate package geometry or composition of the ACF 
may result in opening and bridging failures in the vertical 
and pitch direction, respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To analyze and predict the failure probability of 
ACF-packaged assemblies, Lin et al. [3-6] presented a 
series methods designated as the V-shaped curve method. 
As shown in Figure 2, the V-shaped curve is obtained by 
plotting the opening and bridging probabilities against the 
ACF volume fraction as a function of the pad array 
parameters. The V-shaped curve enables an estimate to be 
made of the optimal volume fraction. Recently, Lin et al. 
analyzed the some specified effects including the 
processing prediction system [7], the systematic and 
stochastic errors [8], the upper-to-lower pad height ratio [9], 
and the misalignment [10]. Above results was shown that 
the V-shaped curve method can provide an effective means 
of predicting the influence of specified effects on the failure 
probability of the ACF IC / substrate package.  
Accordingly, the present study employs the developed 
V-shaped curve method to take account of nxn array effect 
on the different pad array dimension under the specified pad 
geometry parameters for calculating the whole failure 
probability.

III. ANALYSIS OF PADS ARRAY DIMENSION EFFECTS ON 
FAILURE PROBABILITY OF ACF PACKAGE 
 The analyzed cases in this paper considering the square 
pads array numbers (see the fig. 3) including 2x2, 5x5, 
10x10, 20x20, 50x50, and 100x100 under the two sets of 
geometry parameters (d, l, h, and r μm)=A(200, 200, 20, 
and 5 μm) and B(200, 200, 40, and 5 μm).  In calculating 
the global opening probability using Eq. (9), it is first 
necessary to find all of the possible intersections of opening 
events from O1, O2, …, On  and to calculate their 
respective probabilities.  In such pads array analysis, the 
global opening failure probability is computed using the 
following four-event formulation:

Having computed the probability of these four opening 
events, P(O5), P(O6), and P(O7), are combined with the 
result of Eq.(10) and their unions are calculated. The global 
opening failure probability of the assembly is calculated by 
repeating this process iteratively until the opening 
probability at each of the pads within the assembly has been 
considered.  Similarly, the global bridging calculation can 
be carried out by using the above method. 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The yield of electronic products is fundamentally 
dependent upon the quality of the packaging process and 
the designation of the assembly package.  Two sets 
geometry parameters A and B are used to construct this 
analysis under the different volume fraction.  In the case A 
(see fig. 4), the lowest failure probability Pf=7x10-15(2x2) 
and the highest failure probability Pf=3x10-11(100x100) are 
about in the volume fraction Vf =0.062, and it provides the 
optimal designed point of the volume fraction for ACF 
packaging under different pads array dimensions from 2x2 
to 100x100. In the case B (see fig. 5), the lowest failure 
probability Pf=10-14(2x2) and the highest failure probability 
Pf=8x10-11(100x100) are about in the volume fraction Vf 
=0.062, and it provides the optimal designed point of the 
volume fraction for ACF packaging under different pads 
array dimensions from 2x2 to 100x100. The pad height in 
the case A and case B are 20 and 40 μm, respectively. 
Hence, Case B has larger failure probability than case A 
under specified pads dimensions.  The results show the 
smaller pad height can reduce the failure probability.  It is 
presented in the fig. 2 that changing l, d, and h will lead to 
change the failure probability.  However, the method for 
increasing l and d will cause to form a larger IC assembly 
area, and it is not an economy solution. Overall, the results 
presented in this study suggest that the yield of the ACF 
package under great pads array number can be improved by 
decreasing the pad height or choosing the tip volume 
fraction.

(英文) Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) is electrically conducting in the vertical direction (Z-

insulating in the horizontal. ACF looks like paper and consists of thermosetting adhesive, 
conductive particles, and release. The major motive in this research is for the bonding 
demands of the LCD and soft electrics in the fine-pitch, high I/Os, high anti-tensile, high 
anti-shear, high anti-bending, high anti-fatigue, and high reliability. The traditional ACF 
cannot satisfy these critical requirements. Hence, we will try to design, develop and 
manufacture the multi-layered composite Anisotropic Conductive Film in this project.The 
V-shaped curve method (including Poisson function in the vertical direction and Box 
model in the horizontal direction) is used to calculate the packaging yield of the
