Abstract 
 A low-fire Ni-Cu-Zn ferrite+dielectric ceramic composite and its multilayer 
integrated laminate, which can be densified at temperatures below 900℃, is prepared. 
To densify Ni-Cu-Zn ferrite at low temperatures, the dielectric needs to contain an 
effective sintering flux of Bi2O3 or PbO to the Ni-Cu-Zn ferrite. This enables to 
densify the resulting ceramic composite or multilayer integrated dielectric/ferrite 
laminate at temperatures close to those of pure ferrite and dielectric. The dielectric 
constant decreases but the initial permittivity increases with increasing the amount of 
ferrite existing in the ferrite+dielectric ceramic composite.  
Introduction 
 Low-temperature-cofired ceramic (LTCC) with mixed dielectrics or integrated 
dielectric/magnetic materials has been identified to be an enabling solution to 
fabricate miniature filter or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) devices. Undesirable 
cofiring defects including de-densification, de-bonding, cracks and camber [1-3] are 
always found when different materials are cofired to fabricate monolithic ceramic 
components. Major root causes to the formation of above cofiring defects are mainly 
attributed to sintering incompatibility, and densification rate mismatch between 
different materials [4,5]. The former is mainly chemical, which can be solved by 
adding common sintering flux, low-softening-point glass or liquid-phase-sintering aid 
into dielectric and magnetic ceramics. By controlling the amount of sintering fluxes, 
particle sizes of dielectric and magnetic materials, heating rate or packing density of 
green tapes, the level of densification rate mismatch could be minimized to reduce the 
magnitude of tensile stress generated during cofiring. Another approach to solve the 
cofiring issue of densification rate mismatch is to use ceramic powder mixture, which 
contains dielectric and magnetic powders. The ceramic mixture is then fired to form 
dielectric+magnetic composite, which exhibits dielectric and magnetic characteristics 
in one phase. Although this method can avoid the problem of densification rate 
mismatch between different ceramic layers, excellent sintering compatibility between 
dielectric and magnetic powders during cofiring is still required to densify the ceramic 
composite at temperatures close to those of pure dielectric and magnetic materials. 
The objective of this study to develop low-fire dielectric+magnetic composite systems,

sintering compatibility between BZN and ferrite because Bi2O3 was reported to be an 
effective sintering flux to Ni-Cu-Zn ferrite [7]. This in turn promotes the densification 
of BZN+ferrite ceramic composite and its multilayer integrated laminate at 
temperatures required for those of pure BZN and ferrite.  
 Results in Fig. 3 summarize the dielectric constant and initial permeability at 1 
MHz for the composites with different ferrite contents. The dielectric constant 
initially increases when the ferrite content is less than 30 vol%, but decreases with 
increasing ferrite content when the ferrite content is above it. This is due to the 
formation of a new crystalline phase of Bi1.5ZnNb1.5O7, which has a dielectric 
constant (ε) of 170 [9] much larger than those of Bi2Zn0.67Nb1.33O7 (ε=85) and ferrite 
(ε=20). At ferrite contents less than 30 vol%, both BZN phases co-exist. However, 
only the high-dielectric-constant Bi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 phase is formed when the ferrite 
content is greater than 30 vol%, and that the amount decreases with increasing ferrite 
content, in agreement with XRD results in Fig. 2. Results in Fig. 3 also show the 
initial permeability increasing with increasing ferrite content in the BZN+ferrite 
composite.  
Conclusions 
 A binary Ni-Cu-Zn ferrite+dielectric powder composite and its multilayer 
ceramic laminate, which can be densified at temperatures below 900℃, is developed. 
One of critical factors in designing ferrite+dielectric powder composite or multilayer 
laminate cofirable at temperatures close to those of pure ferrite and dielectric is to 
have an effective sintering flux in the ceramic dielectric, such as Bi2O3 or PbO, to 
Ni-Cu-Zn ferrite. The dielectric and magnetic properties of the resulting 
ferrite+dielectric ceramic composite can be fine-tuned by changing the relative 
composition ratio of ferrite to dielectric powder.
