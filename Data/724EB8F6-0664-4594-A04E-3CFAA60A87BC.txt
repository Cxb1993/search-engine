1. Introduction
Corundum–type A4Nb2O9 (A=Mg, Co, Ni,
Zn) ceramics have been studied for microwave
dielectric and magnetic applications.
Mg4Nb2O9 has attracted interest due to its low
dielectric loss and high dielectric constant
[1–7]. Ogawa et al. found Mg4Nb2O9 with
dielectric properties: εr=11, Qf =210,000
GHz and f = –70 ppm/°C [5]. With the
addition of perovskite CaTiO3 showingεr ~170,
Qf ~3600 GHz (at 7 GHz) and f ~800
ppm/°C [8], Huang et al. [9] obtained
0.5Mg4Nb2O9–0.5CaTiO3 ceramics with εr
~24.8, Qf ~82,000 GHz (at 9.1 GHz) and f
~–0.3 ppm/°C. They also reported
0.6Mg4Nb2O9–0.4SrTiO3 ceramics withεr ~21,
Qf ~112,000 GHz (at 9.7 GHz) and f ~1.6
ppm/°C [10] as perovskite SrTiO3 (εr ~205,
Qf ~4200 GHz and f ~1700 ppm/°C) [11]
was added into Mg4Nb2O9. Ogawa et al.
obtained Co4Nb2O9 with dielectric properties:
εr=16, Qf=5,000 GHz and f = –10 ppm/°C
[5]. Yoshida et al. found that only solid
solutions Mg4-xNixNb2O9 (x=0–2) based on the
Mg4Nb2O9 structure type could be formed in
the Mg4Nb2O9–Ni4Nb2O9 system. Qf values
decrease from 192,268 to 28,440 GHz with
increasing nickel content [3]. Tarakina et al.
[12] investigated crystal structure and
magnetic properties of complex oxides
Mg4–xNixNb2O9 (0≤x≤4). They found two
ranges of solid solution in the system
Mg4Nb2O9–Ni4Nb2O9. Solid solutions
Mg4-xNixNb2O9 with a structure based on the
corundum-related phase Mg4Nb2O9 are formed
at 0≤x≤2.75 and a solid solution
Mg4-xNixNb2O9 with a structure based on the
II–Ni4Nb2O9 structure is formed at 2.75≤x≤4.
Khamman et al. [13] prepared Ni4Nb2O9
powders using a rapid vibro-milling technique
and found minor phases of unreacted NiO and
Nb2O5 precursors and NiNb2O6 phase tend to
form together with the Ni4Nb2O9 phase,
depending on calcination conditions.
Single-phase of corundum Ni4Nb2O9 powders
4sintering pellets. It decreased to ~56% at
1300°C/2 h sintering and 48% at 1300°C/4–6 h
sintering. Ni4Nb2O9 content were found >96%
in 1350°C/2 h sintering pellets. This implies
that formation of Ni4Nb2O9 phase is more
difficult than Mg4Nb2O9 phase when the
reaction–sintering process was used.
Figure 7 illustrates the linear shrinkage of the
NN ceramics sintered at various temperatures.
Shrinkage values 11.8–15.2% are found at
1170–1350°C. A similar trend was observed
for the density values as shown in Fig. 8. A
density of 5.71 g/cm3 was obtained for pellets
sintered at 1350°C for 2 h. This reaches 96.5%
of the theoretical density 5.915 g/cm3 of NN
ceramic. The reaction–sintering process is
proven a simple and effective process to obtain
dense NN ceramics. Densification in Ni4Nb2O9
ceramic is more difficult than NiNb2O6 and
Mg4Nb2O9 when the reaction–sintering process
was used.
SEM photographs of as-fired NN ceramics
sintered at 1170–1300°C for 2 h are presented
in Fig. 9. Porous pellet with grains < 2 μm is
observed for 1170°C sintering. Pores decreased
and grain size increased as sintering
temperature increased. Grains > 6μmcould be
found in pellets sintered at 1300°C. This shows
a good agreement with the results of density in
Fig. 8. Grain size increased in NN pellets
sintered for 4 h as shown in Fig. 10. The
average grain sizes for NN ceramics in Figs. 9
and 10 are listed in Table 3. As the sintering
temperature increased to 1350°C, an abnormal
grain growth occurred and grains >100 μm
could be found in Fig. 11.
εr and Qf of NN ceramics sintered at
various temperatures for 2 h are listed in Table
4. εr of 15.4–16.9 are found in pellets sintered
at 1200–1300°C and decreases to 13.2 in
pellets sintered at 1350°C. Qf increased from
9380 GHz in pellets sintered at 1200°C to
14650 GHz in pellets sintered at 1250°C
mainly resulted from the increased density.
Qf decreased to 11650 GHz in pellets sintered
at 1300°C due to the formation of Ni4Nb2O9
phase (shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2) and the
inhomogeneous microstructure (shown in Fig.
9).
4. Conclusions
The reaction–sintering process proved to be a
simple and effective method for obtaining
Mg4Nb2O9 and Ni4Nb2O9 ceramics. Mg4Nb2O9
formed as the major phase. For 2 h sintering,
Mg4Nb2O9 content reached 94–97%. MgNb2O6
content decreased from 4.3% at 1100°C to
0.5% at 1300°C and Mg0.652Nb0.598O2.25
increased from 0.8% at 1100°C to 3.9% at
1300°C. Maximum density 4.26 g/cm3 (97.2%
of the theoretical density) was obtained for
pellets sintered at 1300°C/6 h. Grain size of
5–8 μm formed in pellets sintered at 1150°C
for 2 h. As the sintering temperature increased,
an abnormal grain growth occurred and grains
became >100 μm.
Ni4Nb2O9 phase appeared at 1300°C and
increased with increasing soak time. Ni4Nb2O9
content were found >96% in 1350°C/2 h
sintering pellets. Shrinkage values 11.8–15.2%
are found at 1170–1350°C. A density of 5.71
g/cm3 was obtained for pellets sintered at
1350°C for 2 h. This reaches 96.5% of the
theoretical density. Densification in Ni4Nb2O9
ceramic is more difficult than NiNb2O6 and
Mg4Nb2O9 when the reaction–sintering process
was used. Porous pellet with grains < 2 μm is
observed for 1170°C sintering. Grains > 6 μm
could be found in pellets sintered at 1300°C.
As the sintering temperature increased to
1350°C, an abnormal grain growth occurred
and grains >100 μm could be found. εr of
15.4–16.9 are found in pellets sintered at
1200–1300°C and decreases to 13.2 in pellets
sintered at 1350°C. Qf increased from 9380
GHz in pellets sintered at 1200°C to 14650
GHz in pellets sintered at 1250°C.
