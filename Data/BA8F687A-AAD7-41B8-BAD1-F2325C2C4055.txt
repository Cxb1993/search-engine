dikes, in case they were not failure during a tsunami 
attack, they are able to reduce about 20% the maximum 
run-up heights as the approaching solitary wave 
heights are the same order to the sea-dike crest 
height (the distance from the still water level to 
the crown top). The relationship between the overflow 
height and the overtopping per unit width was found 
to have a good agreement with an empirical formula 
suggested by other researcher. Solitary waves passing 
over a submerged barrier or a sea-dike would induce 
vortexes that are harmful to the onshore face, of 
which design criteria are normally relatively lower 
than that of the offshore face, of the structure.

al. (1994) carried out numerical and 
experimental investigations with a similar 
boundary setup to those of Cooker et. al. 
(1990), except that the cylinders was 
replaced by trapezoid breakwaters. In fact, 
the both papers conducted their experiments 
in the same wave flume. The surface profile 
changes behind the submerged trapezoid 
breakwater were classified into three types 
by the relative height of the breakwater and 
the wave height. The backward breaker was 
also reported in their paper.  
While most studies on the interaction 
between a solitary wave and a structure were 
focused on the surface profile before 1990s, 
there were some laboratory experiments 
looked into the velocity fields afterward (e.g. 
[5], [13], [14], [25]). Among them, Ting and 
Kim (1994) examined the flow separation 
induced by periodic waves propagating over 
a rectangular obstacle of aspect ratio 2.0 
(w=60.96 cm, d=30.48 cm). The velocities 
were measured elaborately by a LDV and 
they concluded that the formation and growth 
of separation region respond directly to the 
surface wave transformation above the 
obstacle. Under a similar flume and obstacle 
arrangement, Chang et. al. (2001) studied 
this subject with an obstacle of aspect ratio 
5.0 (w=40 cm, d=8 cm) under solitary waves. 
By employing PIV, the velocity fields around 
an obstacle were revealed in detail. However, 
due to the size limit of the field of view 
(FOV), they had to repeat the same test 
condition many times, moving the camera 
from one corner to another then integrated 
the pictures which were taken in different 
runs. It is important to indicate that the 
velocity measurement either by using a LDV 
or a PIV that has to integrate pictures taken 
in different runs, the well experimental 
reparability become the minimum 
requirement that has to fulfill. This means 
that the experiments should be carefully 
carried out under a very fine control 
environment to get a high quality data. To 
get rid of those compulsory repeating test 
runs, an alternative to obtain the image with 
a single FOV is to reduce the model scale. 
For example, Lin et. al. (2005) and Lin et. al. 
(2006) studied vortex shedding by a solitary 
wave propagating over a vertical plate and a 
rectangular dike of aspect ratio 2.0 (w=6.0 
cm, d=3.0 cm) respectively. Using a particle 
tracing technique, a laser induced 
fluorescence technique and a PIV, they 
visualized the flow patterns qualitatively and 
quantitatively that their high quality images 
have provided much phenomenological 
insight into the complicated flow field. 
However, their experiments were conducted 
under a relatively lower Reynolds number 
that may ambiguously describe the 
turbulence of the flow field.  
This report describes experiments and 
numerical modelings aimed at improving the 
understanding of hydrodynamic forces and 
the overflows by solitary waves acting upon 
a trapezoidal sea-dike which located on a 
beach slope and a submerged rectangular 
barrier in the water. The behaviors of solitary 
wave evolution, the wave pressure upon the 
sea-dike surface, the overtopping flow rates 
and the flow fields behind the structures were 
measured and reported. 
  
2. Methodologies 
   
2.1 the experiments 
 
The experiments were conducted in two 
wave flumes at Tainan Hydraulics 
Laboratory (THL).  The first wave flume is 
22.0 m long, 0.50 m wide and 0.76 m deep.  
The side walls and part of the bottom were 
made of transparent glass to facilitate 
observation of flow patterns. At one end of 
the flume, solitary waves were generated by 
a digital servo-controlled piston-type 
wavemaker. The second wave flume is the 
Super Tank of THL, which is 300 m long, 5 
m wide and 5.2 m deep To generate a clean 
solitary wave, Goring’s procedure, which 
based on the solution given by Boussinesq 
(1872), was applied in both flumes.

2.1.2 a rectangular barrier in a constant 
water depth  
The experimental facilities and setup 
for a rectangular barrier in a constant water 
depth is schematically shown in Fig. 3. The 
rectangular barrier with a height of d=10 
cm and a thickness of w=2 cm was mounted 
on the bottom of the flume. The distance 
from its top to the still water level are 4 cm 
and 8 cm  (0.29 h , 0.44 h)as the water 
depth were 14 cm and 18 cm respectively, 
i.e., the relative barrier height, d/h, is 0.71 
and 0.56 for the two water depths.  Under 
these condition, the minimum Reynolds 
number is 1.5×105. The origin of the 
coordinate system is defined at the 
intersection of the bottom and the left 
vertical boundary of the barrier. 
Streamwise and vertical fluid velocities 
were measured by a dual cameras PIV 
system.  The CCD camera has a maximum 
30 frames per second (fps), a resolution of 
1600×1200 pixels, and a dynamic range of 
10 bits.  The spatial resolution of the 
camera is 0.124 mm/pixel and the size of 
the FOV of each camera was 
198.76×149.07 mm2.  Two identical 
cameras were lined up vertically and 
mounted at a rigid structure on a 
three-dimensional traverse controlled by 
digital servo-motors with a precision of 
0.02 mm.  Instantaneous particle images 
were captured simultaneously by the two 
synchronized cameras to mosaic a larger 
FOV.  A dual-head Nd:YAG laser system 
was used to illuminate the measuring 
section. It has a wavelength of 532 nm, a 
maximum energy output of 120 mJ/pulse 
and a repetition rate of 30 Hz.  The light 
sheet with a thickness about 1 mm was 
formed with 6.5 cm away from the side wall 
using a cylindrical lens (focal length -15.0 
mm) and a spherical lens (focal length 1 m).  
The water in the wave tank was seeded with 
uncoated hollow-glass spherical particles 
that have a mean diameter of 10 μm and a 
specific gravity of 1.05 g/cm3.  The tracer 
particles were carefully mixed in the water 
of the flume near the measuring area before 
each test run. 
The surface wave profiles were 
measured by six capacitance-type wave 
gauges. To integrate the dual camera PIV, 
the surface wave sensors and the wave 
board motion, high accurate and 
synchronized TTL triggers were used to 
control the camera exposure and laser 
pulses.  The DAQ system was 
synchronized with the triggering signals of 
the PIV system.  The start of the analog 
measurements was triggered by an external 
TTL trigger generated by the DAQ system 
of the wavemaker (Fig. 3).  The PIV 
measurements were started with a 
prescribed time delay behind the analog 
measurements to skip useless data 
recording.  The time interval between two 
successive laser pulses in the PIV system 
was set at 1 ms.  The camera framing rate 
was set at 30 Hz, yielding a temporal 
resolution of 15 phases per second.  The 
same experiments were repeated 35 times 
with durations of surface elevation and PIV 
measurements of 30 and 15 seconds in each 
test run. 
In addition, a particle tracing technique 
was used for the qualitative flow 
visualization.  The seeding particles were

2.1.3 a sea-dike model on a 1:20 slopping 
beach in the Super Tank of THL 
The experimental setup for a sea-dike 
model on a 1:20 slopping beach in the Super 
Tank is similar to that of in the smaller flume, 
as described in 2.1.1, but with a 10 times  
scale up (Fig. 4). The waves were generated 
by a hydraulically driven, dry back, piston 
type wave-maker with a maximum stroke of 
2.0 meter. Time series of local water surface 
elevation were recorded by capacitance-type 
wave gages distributed at 16 stations along 
the tank. Each sensor of the gages was 
mounted at 0.4 m away from the sidewall. 
The resolution of the gages is 12 bits on a 
dynamic range of 1.0 m. Among the 16 wave 
gages, there were 10 gages located beyond 
the initial shoreline. As these gages were 
entirely out of water before the wave passing 
by, their outputs were carefully examined to 
avoid wrong signals. The shoreline motion 
was monitored by a special run-up gage. 
From this gage, the maximum run-up heights 
can be determined and these were compared 
to those which by direct visual observations. 
The dynamic wave pressure was measured 
by pressure transducers with a diameter of 10 
mm at 10 locations on the sea-dike (Fig. 5, 
sensors were installed on the black bar in the 
center of the sea-dike). The surface 
displacement were recorded simultaneously 
with 50 Hz sampling rate through the 
Microsoft NT based Multi –Nodes –Data 
-Acquisition -System (MNDAS), developed 
by THL. The pressure data were acquired 
with 200 Hz, also by the MANDAS. 
In the Super Tank, only the cases with 
H/h=0.1 under h=1.8 m, 2.0 m and 2.56 m 
were conducted.

2.2 the numerical modeling 
The SPH method is a Lagrangian 
description of flow field coordinates and 
mesh free approach.  
2.2.1 governing equations 
The 2-D governing equations include 
the mass and the momentum conservation 
equations, written in Lagrangian form as: 
1 0D u
Dt
ρ
ρ + ∇ ⋅ =   (1) 
21Du P g u
Dt
υρ= − ∇ + + ∇   (2)  
where ρ, the fluid particle density;  t, the 
time; u, the particle velocity; P, the pressure; 
g, the gravitational acceleration and ν, the 
dynamic viscosity coefficient.  
2.2.2 kernel approximation 
The two key steps in SPH are the 
“kernel approximation” and the particle 
approximation. A kernel function can be 
obtained by integrating a function and a 
smoothing kernel function as: 
1

where ( ', )W x x h− is a kernel function, h is the 
smoothing length or width of the kernel

very similar to the Dirac delta function.

2.2.3 particle approximation 
The difference between SPH method 
and other traditional numerical methods is 
that a function is approximated by a set of 
disordered particles instead of grid or mesh 
points. Assuming that ΔVj is a tiny particle 
volume in calculating domain, the mass of a 
particle in j can be expressed as:  
j j jm V ρ= Δ  (6) 
where ρj is the density of particle j. Here 
1,2....j N= , and N is the total particle number in 
calculating domain. Then, the integral 
interplant eq.(5) can be expressed in terms of 
discrete particles as:

sea-dike. The wave front then entrained a 
large quantum of air, splashed-up and 
rushed up the slope. The overtopping wave 
of Type A is relatively weak and almost 
propagating over the sea-dike along the 
object surface. It was noticed that the 
overtopping flows of Types A would result 
in overturning flow similar to a spray jet 
(Fig 3-a3). In the meantime, there also 
formed a reflected wave travelling offshore 
(Fig. 6-a3~3-a6). In Type B case, the wave 
directly plunging on the seaward slope of 
the sea-dike and then a stronger overtopping 
flow is observed to spill on the landward 
slope (Fig. 6-b4). The overturning tip hit on 
the dry bed that could result in a sharp 
impact force around the struck area. As for 
Type C, the wave directly collapses on the 
landward side of the sea-dike. An interesting 
phenomenon as the flow just separated is 
that a strong vortex was generated, initially 
climbing toward the crown then spreading 
downstream subsequently. This can also be 
popularly found in studies about solitary 
waves interacting with submerged structures, 
ex. Lin et. al. (2006). It should be addressed 
that the presence of vortex would capture 
significant air-bubbles, which could 
contribute to the damping of wave acting 
pressure. On the other hand, the existence of 
vortex means a stronger shear stress that 
may cause scouring problems. 
 
 
Fig.6 The three types of solitary waves (left column: h=20.0 cm, H=6.4 cm; middle column: 
h=22.0 cm, H=4.8 cm; right column: h=25.6 cm, H=5.9 cm) 
 
Fig. 7 shows SPH model verification 
with theoretical result by Su and Mirie 
(1980). It clear shows that the model works 
very well, especial for those of non-linearity 
smaller than 0.3.  Fig. 8 shows an SPH 
simulated example of surface wave profile 
evolution as a solitary wave of which 
H/h=0.2 propagates along a slopping beach 
and overflows a sea-dike. Some closer views 
of the surface profile and the velocity field 
near the sea-dike are displayed in Fig. 9. 
Tongue-like wave front just as a wave 
overtopping the sea-dike as observed from 
the flow visualization can also be seen from 
the SPH model result (Fig. 10).

short duration in Type A, there exhibits a 
clear first peak then the mentioned second 
peak in Type B case (Fig. 11(b)-p1, p5 & p7). 
Kirkgöz (1995) also indicated that the first 
peak which is mainly caused by the impact 
force is generally much larger than the 
second one. While in present results, it 
seemed that the two are almost the same 
order. This might because of the insufficient 
sampling rate. Another reason may be due 
the relatively mild seaward slope we used. 
The sampling rate of pressure transducers 
had been tested from 0.5K~ 2 K Hz, and 
finally 1 K Hz was used. While Kato et. al. 
(2006) indicated that 0.5 K Hz should be 
enough. For Type C case, the pressure signal 
on the seaward slope seem to be hydrostatic, 
while the pressure signal on the landward 
side (Fig. 11(c)-p12 & p14) exhibit a 
“sub-atmosphere pressure” phenomenon, as 
reported by Bredmose et. al. (2003) and in 
Bullock et al. (2007). According to their 
studies, these are generated when the 
aeration level is high. Under this 
circumstance, a large amount of air is 
entrained, causing a longer duration of 
air–fluid interaction.  
Figure 12 shows the maximum 
dynamic wave impinging pressure 
distributions along the sea-dike. It is found 
that the larger impinging pressures of Types 
A occurred near the toe of the sea-dike, 
which is close to the initial shore line. In 
addition, another larger dynamic pressure 
region was found around p5 and p6. As for 
Types B and Types C cases, note that the 
maximum pressure on top of the dike and on 
the upper levels of the landward slope are 
relatively small. And it increases with the 
decreases of transducer elevation on the 
landward slope (p11~p14 in Fig. 12b & Fig. 
12c), which similar trend can also be found 
in Kato et. al. (2006).

with it’s center almost down to half of the 
water depth (Fig. 16(f)). The primary vortex 
was seen to transport downstream all the 
way in previous moments, yet it was seen to 
move back toward the barrier in this figure. 
Besides, another counterclockwise vortex 
generated among the primary vortex, the 
barrier and the bottom was noticed. 
Although it is not clearly revealed in Fig. 
16(f), the PIV measurement will show this. 
Fig. 4. and Fig. 18 display the mean 
velocity vectors and the calculated vorticity 
measured by PIV at the six phases 
corresponding to those in Fig. 16. The 
evolution of the vortexes can be seen clearly 
through these figures, where their rotation 
directions, the variation of centre locations 
and strengths were revealed. The flow 
pattern at t=9.2 sec, which has been shown 
qualitatively in Fig 3(a), was again 
displayed in the PIV vectors map. While the 
PIV vectors of the separated shear layers 
originated from the leading edges are not as 
clear as those recognized by the particle 
tracing technique, the vorticity figure, on the 
other hand, clearly confirm the existing of 
strong shear layers around the barrier edges 
(Fig. 17(a), Fig. 18(a)).  Looking more 
detail into the velocity vectors in Fig. 17(a), 
it shows that all the velocity vectors close to 
the free surface have positive vertical 
component. This agrees with the 
characteristic of a solitary wave propagation 
that the particles located ahead of the wave 
crest are lifted. When the wave crest reaches 
the barrier, it shows that all the ambient 
velocity vectors right above the barrier have 
only horizontal component, though the 
velocity vectors located in the upper zone 
away from the barrier still point upper right 
to the figure (Fig. 17(b)). 
As the backward breaker plunging on 
the free surface, the water particles in the 
overturning part rotate counterclockwise 
(Fig. 17(c), Fig. 18(c)). The changing of size 
and center location of the primary vortex 
can also be seen in these two figures: it 
clearly has a scale of about half of the 
barrier height and its center is located away 
from the barrier about the distance of a 
barrier height. Moreover, since the wave 
crest has passed the barrier, the ambient 
velocity vectors have negative vertical 
component, even for those located in the 
right hand side. And this is reasonable that 
during the short interval of about 0.39 s, the 
solitary wave crest, theoretically propagates 
at 1.44 m/s, has totally traveled out of the 
figure boundary. That is, in contrast to those 
in Fig. 17(a), the particles located behind a 
solitary wave crest are pulled down. Fig. 
17(d) shows the velocity just post breaking. 
The mentioned air-entrained roller 
obviously rotate counterclockwise, while the 
spilling jet ahead of the breaker also looks 
rotating counterclockwise. The vorticity 
figure, Fig. 18(d) further confirms this.  
The solitary wave recorded by gage No. 
3 is almost gone at t=9.8 s and the free 
surface seems to has returned to its leveled 
stage at t=10.2 s however, the primary 
vortex and the two secondary vortexes are 
still evolving energetically under water. 
induced by the backward breaking have 
started dissipating after t=9.6 s, when the 
solitary wave is about to gone (Fig. 17(e), 
Fig. 17(f)). The air-entrained roller, of 
which size becoming larger, was pulled 
down as the primary moving toward the 
barrier. At the mean time, the both velocity 
and vorticity figures show that there forms 
another counterclockwise, from the bottom, 
between the primary vortex and the barrier 
(Fig. 18(e), Fig. 18(f)).  
Conditions to generate a backward 
breaker when a solitary propagates over a 
submerged structure can be found in the 
Figure 2 of [6] and the Fig. 2(a) of [7].  If 
we assume the relative barrier height in our 
study d/h to be the relative radius R in [6] or 
the relative breakwater height h1’ in [7], it is 
found that our test condition lies on the 
border of the B-B (backward breaker) zone 
and the F-B (forward breaker) zone of [6], 
but it falls in the FB (forward breaking) 
zone of [7]. The discrepancy may be due to 
the different submerged structure shapes.  
Regardless of solitary waves, steady flows 
over submerged obstacles have been 
extensively studied. Using the upstream

國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                     日期：100 年 6 月 20 日 
一、前言 
可視化（visualization）係一種科技整合的影像科學和技術，可以應用在各種
不同的研究領域中，以協助觀察分析欲探討的變化特性，而能逐步取代利用量測
儀器的功能，因此逐漸受到學術研究，甚至工程應用者之重視。有鑑於此，於 1988
年乃在中國北京成立亞洲可視化學會（Asian Society of Visualization），同時舉辦第
1 屆亞洲可視化研討會，第 2 屆（1992）在中國杭州、第 3 屆（1994）日本千葉
（Chiba）、第 4 屆（1996）中國北京、第 5 屆（1999）印尼巴里（Bali）、第 6 屆
（2001）韓國八松（Basan）、第 7 屆（2003）新加坡、第 8 屆（2005）泰國清邁
（Chiangmai）、第 9 屆（2007）香港、第 10 屆（2010）印度清奈（Chennai）、第
11 屆（2011）日本新潟（Niigata）。由於本人在 2007 年帶領台灣教授團參加並提
出口頭申辦 2013 年在台灣舉行第 12 屆亞洲可視化研討會，當時即由該學會的國
際委員原則同意接受申請，但需正式在印度、清邁會議期間提出申請，並報告台
灣相關的舉辦狀況，因此 2011 年本人乃帶著成大水工所黃國書博士、中興大學林
計畫編號 NSC-97-2221-E-006-259-MY3 
計畫名稱 海嘯波作用於海岸及陸上結構物之互制影響 
出國人員
姓名 黃煌煇 
服務機構
及職稱 
國立國立成功大學水利及海洋工程
學系教授、校長 
會議時間 100年 6月 5日至 100 年 6 月 9 日 會議地點 日本新潟(Niigata) 
會議名稱 
(中文)第 11 屆亞洲可視化國際研討會 
(英文)The 11th Asian Symposium in Visualization 
發表論文
題目 
(中文) 
(英文)詳如「參加會議經過」段落所列 4 篇論文 
 3
同完成之 Effects of Non-Uniform Cleanness of Water Screens on Pump Intake 
Flows 亦獲獎，不但是國立國立成功大學的光榮，亦是台灣在可視化研究之優異
表現。6 月 9 日一天係安排工程參觀，由於本人在國內尚有多事需處理，因此乃
於 6 月 9日當天搭機返台，結束此次行程。 
三、與會心得 
此次會議中國大陸亦有多人參加，為出席人數第 2 多的國家，而台灣因為要
舉辦第 12 屆亞洲可視化會議，因此在本人用心的邀請下亦有 12 篇論文、15 個人
參加，為與會第 3 多的國家。然在此次會議中不論論文之撰寫或發表，我們都以
Taiwan 或 R.O.C.稱呼，中國方面並無任何不友善的舉動，因此雙方就有很熱絡的
交流，由此可見日後在許多國際學術活動的場合，應將學術與政治分開處理，而
且以平和、友善的態度交流，應可得到其他國家的支持。 
另外學術靠的是實力，有關可視化研究的能量與水準，台灣遠比中國大陸優
異，因而能受到世界各國的重視，也因此有較大的活動力與發言權，此乃國內參
與國際活動時應特別重視之處，此次能爭取到第 12 屆亞洲可視化研討會主辦權，
除有真正的實力外，本人亦曾邀請日本此次大會主席前來成大參觀訪問，讓他們
瞭解台灣的實力，自然就會獲得其他國家從旁支持、完成任務。 
四、結論 
欲在國際學術領域有影響力，必需在國內學者共同努力合作並事前有組織性
的規劃，才能展現台灣的實力。此次能順利達成任務即為明證，同時為了辦好國
際會議，躍上國際學術舞台，主辦單位應事前做好各種完善規劃及準備工作。因
此返台後本人即已訂定時間召集此次會議之執行秘書、副執行秘書進行規劃會
議，希望兩年後，能舉辦一次令世界各國驚嘆的一次國際會議。
