Abstract 
The current study synthesizes amphiphilic thermally/pH- sensitive block copolymers PNiPAAm-b-PHpr by 
condensation polymerization of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hpr) initiated from hydroxy-terminated 
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) as the macroinitiator in the presence of SnOct2 as the catalyst. 
These copolymers are characterized by 1H NMR, FTIR, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Their 
solutions show reversible changes in optical properties: transparent below a lower critical solution 
temperature (LCST) and opaque above the LCST. The LCST values depend on the polymer composition and 
the media. Owing to their amphiphilic characteristics, the block copolymers form micelle in the aqueous 
phase with critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) in the range of 1.23 – 3.73 mg L-1. Increased hydrophobic 
segment length or decreased hydrophilic segment length in an amphiphilic diblock copolymer produces lower 
CMC values. The current work proves the core-shell structure of micelles by 1H NMR analyses of the 
micelles in D2O. Transmission electron microscopy analyzes micelle morphology, showing a spherical 
structure. The micelles have an average size below 100 nm. Observations show high drug entrapment 
efficiency and drug loading content for the drug micelles.

Trans-4-hydroxy-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proline (NZHpr) and Indomethacin were purchased from the Fluka 
Chemical Co. (Buchs SGI, Switzerland). Stannous octoate (SnOct2) was purchased from the Strem Chemical 
Co. (Newburyport, MA). Organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol, chloroform, 
N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and n-hexane with a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade 
were purchased from the Merck Chemical (Darmstad, Germany). Ultrapure water was used by purification 
with a Milli-Q Plus (Waters, Milford, MA). 
Synthesis of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr 
The block copolymers with different contents and compositions were synthesized according to the method 
reported previously (Scheme 1).26 Briefly, a hydroxy-terminated PNiPAAm precursor polymer was prepared 
by radical copolymerization using BPO as an initiator and 2-hydroxyethanethiol as a chain transfer agent 
(CTA). For instance, N-isopropylacrylamide (4.2 g, 37.1 mmol), 2-hydroxyethanethiol (0.29 g, 3.71 mmol) 
and BPO (83.4 mg, 2 wt %) were dissolved in 15 mL of THF. The solution was degassed by bubbling with 
nitrogen for 20 min. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 h under nitrogen. Upon completion, the product 
was precipitated out by adding diethyl ether. The block copolymers of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr were synthesized 
by condensation polymerization of NZHpr with the hydroxy-terminated precursor in chlorobenzene using 
SnOct2 as the catalyst. All monomers and the precursor polymer were dried in a vacuum oven before reaction. 
The reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 h under nitrogen. Table 1 lists the properties of the resultant block 
copolymers. Figures 1(A) and 2(B) show the representative 1H NMR and FTIR of PNiPAAm36-b-PNZHpr78. 
Deprotection of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr 
PNiPAAm-b-PHpr was prepared by deprotection of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr using HBr/CH3CO2H. Typically, 
PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr (1.04 g, 0.043 mmol) was dissolved in 6.0 mL of trifluoroacetic acid. Then, 4 equiv of 
33 % HBr/AcOH with respect to the benzyl carbamate (Z) group was added, the solution was stirred for 1 h at 
room temperature. To precipitate the polymer, the solution was slowly poured into an excess of diethyl ether 
under vigorous stirring. Then the product was washed with diethyl ether 4 times, and the polymer was isolated 
and dried at 50 ℃ . Figures 1(C) and 2(C) show the representative 1H NMR and FTIR of 
PNiPAAm36-b-PHpr81. 
Characterization 
1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz (with a Bruker WB/DMX-500 spectrometer, Ettlingen, Germany) 
with chloroform (δ = 7.24 ppm) as an internal standard in chloroform-d (CDCl3). IR spectra were measured 
on a Bruker TENSOR 27 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Bruker, Germany). Samples 
were either neatly placed on NaCl plates or pressed into KBr pellets. Number and weight-average molecular 
weights (Mn and Mw, respectively) of the polymer were determined by a GPC system, carried out on a Jasco 
HPLC system equipped with a model PU-2031 refractive-index detector (Tokyo, Japan), and Jordi Gel 
polydivinyl benzene (DVB) columns with pore sizes of 100, 500, and 1000 Å. Chloroform was used as the 
 8
solution (C = 0.3 g L-1, no containing stain agent) were placed on a carbon film coated on a copper grid, and 
then dried at room temperature. The observation was conducted at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. 
Drug-loading content and drug entrapment efficiency determinants 
Using oil-in-water solvent evaporation, PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr (50-fold CMC value) was dissolved in 6 mL of 
methylene chloride followed by adding the anti-inflammatory drug  indomethacin (IMC) with various weight 
ratios to the polymer (0.1/1~2/1) serving as a model drug. The solution was added dropwise to 150 mL of 
distilled water containing 1 wt % poly(vinyl alcohol) under vigorous stirring. Poly(vinyl alcohol) was used as 
a surfactant to reduce micelle aggregation. Sonication reduced droplet size at ambient temperature for 60 min. 
The emulsion was stirred at ambient temperature overnight to evaporate the methylene chloride. The unloaded 
residue of IMC was removed by filtration using a Teflon filter (Whatman) with an average pore size of 0.45 
μm. Vacuum drying obtained the micelles. A weighed amount of micelle was disrupted by adding a ten-fold 
excess volume of DMF. Drug content was assayed spectrophotometrically at 320 nm using a Diode Array 
UV-vis Spectrophotometer. Equations (1) and (2) calculate the drug-loading content and drug entrapment 
efficiency, respectively:  
Drug-loading content (%)  
= (weight of drug in micelles / weight of micelles) × 100   (1) 
Drug entrapment efficiency (%) 
= (weight of drug in micelles / weight of drug fed initially) × 100     (2) 
In Vitro Degradation 
In vitro degradation of about 50 mg of copolymer thin pellets was performed in 5 mL of PBS (0.067 M, pH 
7.4) at 37 ℃, and the buffer solution was changed every 2 days. At time intervals, the specimen was removed, 
washed with distilled water, lyophilized, and weighed. The degree of degradation (%) was equal to 100(D0－
D)/D0, where D0 is the weight of the copolymer before degradation and D is the weight of the copolymer after 
degradation for a certain period. 
Results and discussion 
Synthesis and characterization of PNiPAAm-b-PHpr block copolymers 
The preparation of hydroxyl-terminated PNiPAAm has been reported for a long time. Its molecular weight can 
be controlled by the ratio of NiPAAm to chain transfer reagent. The Mn,NMR of PNiPAAm was 870, 2340, and 
4152 g mol-1 with DP = 7, 20, and 36, respectively. These polymers were soluble in aqueous media at 
temperatures below their lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Findings show the LCSTs of these 
polymers depend on their molecular weights and the media. The LCST increased from 34.5 to 47.6 ℃ in DI 
water, and increased from 31.9 to 41.3 ℃ in PBS when the molecular weight of PNiPAAm decreased from 
4152 to 870 g mol-1. The PNiPAAm polymers with lower molecular weights demonstrate higher LCST values. 
This is considered to result from hydrating contributions from polar terminal hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in 
 10
The absorption bands at 1705 (νcarbonyl of urethane) and 698 cm-1 (νC-H out-of-plane bending of aromatic) 
disappeared completely upon deprotection 
LCST behavior 
PNiPAAm is one of the most widely invested thermo-sensitive polymers with a highly hydrated extended coil 
to globule transition upon heating. The transition results in precipitation of the sol to gel transformation of 
PNiPAAm or related copolymers. This work characterizes LCST behaviors of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr 
copolymers solutions by measuring their cloud points. The LCSTs were determined at a temperature with half 
of the optical transmittance change between below and above the transition. Table 2 summarizes the results. 
The LCST values of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr copolymer solution in DI water were higher than in PBS. Figure 
3(A) shows the transmittance changes in PNiPAAm36-b-PNZHpr78 in DI water and PBS solution. It was 
found that the cloud points and phase-transition curve of copolymer solutions shifted to a higher temperature 
and become broader in DI water solution. Findings show that the LCSTs of PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr copolymers 
were higher than that of homo-PNiPAAm when using the longer PNiPAAm (PNiPAAm20 and PNiPAAm36). 
For the PNiPAAm20-b-PNZHpr series of copolymers, the LCST values increased when the length of PNZHpr 
block increased. However, no transition behaviors were observed when using the shorter PNiPAAm 
(PNiPAAm7, 0.2 wt %), due to the easily soluble of PNiPAAm7-b-PNZHPr series of copolymers in DI water 
and PBS solution. These outcomes indicate that hydrophilicity of the PNiPAAm block significantly affects the 
transition temperature of the corresponding copolymer, and the chain length of the PNZHpr block did not 
notably influence the transition temperature. This may be attributed to hydrophobic interaction and 
hydrophobicity do not show any significant change.30 
Figure 3(B) shows the transmittance changes in deprotection PNiPAAm-b-PHPr at different temperatures. It 
was found that the cloud points of copolymer solutions shifted to a lower temperature with the increasing 
PHpr content at pH 7.4. The LCST increase from 33.7 to 50.5 ℃ when the weight fraction of PHpr (WPHpr) 
increase from 58 to 89% in the PNiPAAm-b-PHPr copolymers. Furthermore, when the PHpr block was long 
enough, the transition was very weak even in a higher temperature range. The lowest transmittance for 
PNiPAAm17-b-PHpr24 was much higher than that of PNiPAAm7-b-PHpr62 which reached 60%. It can be 
anticipated that the LCST behavior of copolymers can even be lost as the length increase of the PHpr block. 
This suggests that the hydrophilicity of the PHpr block affects significantly the solution behavior of the 
corresponding copolymer. The temperature is higher than the LCST of PNiPAAm (32 ℃) due to the reason 
that the soluble PHpr blocks enhanced the hydrophilic property of the copolymer. 
The temperature-dependent phase-transition curves of the 0.2 wt% PNiPAAm36-b-(PHpr34/PNZHpr44) PBS 
solutions at different pHs are shown in Figure 4. As the pH decrease from 8.2 to 4.2, the copolymer shows 
similar phase-transition curves, and the LCSTs only slightly increase. When the pH is lowered to 2.2, the 
curve exhibited a broader transformation and the LCST markedly increases. That was because PHPr was 
 12
originated from selective solvation of the exterior hydrophilic PNiPAAm shell through hydrogen bond 
formation with D2O (Fig. 1(B)). The results reveal that the PNZHpr blocks in PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr block 
copolymers formed a hydrophobic domain in the nanoparticles and remained in a solid and/or semi-solid state, 
resulting in the disappearance of PNZHpr characteristic peaks in D2O. Similar trends of 1H NMR spectra are 
consistent with other amphiphilic block copolymer systems.33 
Evaluation of drug loading content and drug entrapment efficiency 
This research measured drug-loading content and entrapment efficiency of polymeric micelles fabricated by 
an oil-in-water solvent evaporation method with various IMC-to-polymer feed ratios by UV-vis absorption 
spectroscopy. IMC had a maximum absorption peak at 320 nm, proportional to concentration. After 
eliminating the unloaded precipitates of IMC, the amount of loaded IMC was determined by absorbance at 
320 nm. Table 2 shows the calculated drug-loading content and entrapment efficiency values. The amount of 
IMC introduced into the micelle was controlled by the weight ratio between the drug and polymer. For 
example, in the PNiPAAm36-b-PNZHpr78 series, drug entrapment efficiency and drug-loading content 
increased when the weight ratio of drug to polymer increased. At the constant feed weight ratio (1/1), the 
drug-loading content and entrapment efficiency showed a general trend of increasing these efficiencies (up to 
48.2 %, and 96.3 %) with PNZHpr block length increment. Observations show a similar increased tendency in 
drug-loading content and entrapment efficiency for PNIPA20-b-PNZHpr copolymers with different lengths of 
PNZHpr. These values strongly relate to the interaction parameter between the hydrophobic segment of the 
micelle and drug. A hydrophobic block approximately the same length showed decreased drug-loading 
content and entrapment efficiency when hydrophilic segment length increased. During drug loading, the 
PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr block copolymers showed excellent characteristics as drug carriers owing to their high 
drug loading efficiencies and drug contents.  
Preliminary in vitro Degradation Study 
As a model of biodegradation, the in vitro degradation of the PNiPAAm-b-PNZHpr was evaluated from the 
weight loss of the sample in the film. The degradation profiles of PNiPAAm7-b-PNZHpr32, 
PNiPAAm20-b-PNiPAAm53 and PNiPAAm20-b-PNZHpr29 with the WPNiPAAm 11, 16, and 23%, respectively, 
at 37 ℃ under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) are portrayed in Figure 8. The results indicated that the 
weight loss of PNiPAAm20-b-PNZHpr29 with the highest WPNiPAAm was the fastest, up to 15% weight loss 
after immersion for 30 days. The easier degradation of PNiPAAm20-b-PNZHpr29 is due to the longer length 
of the hydrophilic PNiPAAm block and the shorter length of the hydrophobic PNZHpr block. Increased 
PNiPAAm contents in the copolymers increased their hydrophilicity and thus resulted in larger weight losses. 
In vitro release of IMC 
Hydrophobic drugs could be loaded into the micelles due to the hydrophobic core of the micelles. 
Indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug with a very low solubility in water, was used as a model drug. The
