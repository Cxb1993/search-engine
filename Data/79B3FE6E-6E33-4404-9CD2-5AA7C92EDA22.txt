1.  Introduction 
 
The eutectic (63Sn-37Pb) or near-eutectic (60Sn-40Pb) tin-lead alloys are widely used in 
the electronics industry due to their lower melting temperature, good wetting ability and 
mechanical integrity.  Nevertheless, because of the concern of human health and 
environments, several countries such as U.S.A., European Union (EU) and Japan, have made 
legislation to limit the use of lead [1].  This makes new lead-free solders being intensely 
developed to replace traditional Pb-containing ones.   
Many studies on lead-free solders have been focused on Sn-based alloys.  In 
particular, Sn-Ag alloys are expected to replace the eutectic Sn-37Pb solder due to their better 
mechanical properties (ductility, creep resistance and thermal resistance) [2].  Although the 
melting temperature and wetting ability of Sn-Ag alloy systems are poorer than the traditional 
Pb-containing solders, it is the first commercial lead-free solder in the world.  In electronic 
packages, TMF and creep could cause failure of solder joints in service.  Creep rupture of 
solder joints is likely to take place at the typical service temperature range (25oC ~ 100oC).  
In addition, because the solder is softer than other surrounding materials, the thermally 
induced cyclic loading in the solder joints can be described as strain-controlled LCF.  
Therefore, it is very important to characterize the creep and LCF behavior of the newly 
developed lead-free solders for better reliability analysis. 
Initial microstructures and mechanical properties of solder joints can be affected by 
several processing variables such as solder reflow time, cooling rate, temperatures, aging time, 
etc.  As solder joints are used at high homologous temperature, coarsening of microstructure 
might occur during thermo-mechanical cycling resulting from temperature fluctuations.  
There were a few studies [3-6] on the relationship between thermo-mechanical cycling 
behavior and microstructure of solder alloys in recent years.  In those studies [3-6], 
microstructural coarsening during thermo-mechanical cycling was observed.  Therefore, 
microstructural coarsening is an important issue for studying the long-term mechanical failure 
mechanisms in solder alloys.   
Although there have been some studies on the relationship between the mechanical 
properties and microstructural coarsening in Sn-Ag solder alloys, research on the variation of 
creep and LCF behavior in these alloys with microstructural factors is still limited.  In 
particular, effects of microstructural coarsening on the creep and LCF properties of the most 
promising lead-free solder, Sn-3.5Ag alloy, is still absent.  The objective of this study is 
therefore to characterize the microstructural coarsening effects on the creep and LCF behavior 
of Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy through systematic experiments with various aging treatments. 
 
2. Experimental procedures 
 
2.1.  Creep Test 
 
The eutectic Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy used in creep test was supplied by the vendor in the 
form of extruder round bars.  The chemical composition of this material is given in Table 1.  
Axial smooth-surface specimens with a uniform cylindrical gage section of 8 mm in diameter 
and 48 mm in length were used in creep tests.  Before creep testing, each specimen was aged 
at one of the following conditions: (1) natural aging at RT for 30 days (designated as RT-30), 
(2) natural aging at RT for 600 days (designated as RT-600), (3) RT-600 followed by artificial 
aging at 120oC for 3 days (designated as 120-3), and (4) RT-600 followed by artificial aging at 
150oC for 3 days (designated as 150-3).  Creep testing results from these four sets of 
specimens will be made a comparison to study the aging effect on the microstructural change 
and creep behavior for the given lead-free solder. 
3 
 SEM micrographs of microstructure in the given extruded Sn-3.5Ag alloy are shown in 
Fig. 1.  The dark areas are the primary β-Sn phases and the light areas are the eutectic phases.  
Ag3Sn IMCs can be observed in the eutectic phases as shown in Fig. 1.  Fig. 1(a) shows the 
microstructure in the alloy after aging of RT-30.  By means of a linear-intercept method, the 
average size of β-Sn phase is determined as approximately 10 μm.  Fig. 1(b) shows the 
microstructure after aging of RT-600 and the average size of β-Sn phase is about 12 μm.  
Figs. 1(c) and (d) show the microstructures after aging of RT-600 followed by aging of 120-3 
and 150-3, respectively.  The average sizes of β-Sn phase in 120-3 and 150-3 aging 
conditions are approximately 14 μm and 15 μm, respectively.  Comparison of these figures 
indicated that coarsening of β-Sn phases and Ag3Sn IMCs indeed occurred in the specimens 
aged at a longer time (RT-600) or high temperatures (120-3 and 150-3) with respect to those 
aged at a short time at RT (RT-30). 
Tensile properties for the given extruded alloy under differently aged conditions are 
summarized in Table 3.  As seen in Table 3, the elastic modului in such aged conditions are 
of little difference.  However, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in aging conditions of 
RT-600, 120-3, and 150-3 was each much smaller than that in RT-30.  The reduction of UTS 
can be attributed to presence of larger β-Sn phases in the microstructure, as shown in Fig. 1.  
In addition, the coarser Ag3Sn IMCs observed in Figs. 1(b)-1(d) can reduce the strength of 
Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy as well.  It is clearly seen in Table 3 that the UTS of Sn-3.5Ag alloy 
after aging of 150-3 is smaller than that after aging of 120-3.  As shown in Figs. 1(c) and 
1(d), there is no significant difference in the size of β-Sn phases between these two aging 
conditions.  However, it can be clearly observed that coarser Ag3Sn IMCs were present after 
aging of 150-3 (Fig. 2(b)).  Such larger IMC particles are the main reason to cause a smaller 
UTS of Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy after aging of 150-3 compared to that after aging of 120-3.  
Although fine Ag3Sn IMCs can improve the strength of lead-free solder, the coarsening of 
Ag3Sn IMCs can cause the degradation of strength.  Similar results have been found in other 
studies [9-11].  
 
3.1.2.  Creep Curves and Resistance 
 
Typical creep curves of the extruded Sn-3.5Ag alloy at four differently aged conditions 
are presented in Fig. 3.  These curves show characteristics of secondary creep right after 
loading with very little primary creep.  This indicates that the strain hardening in the primary 
creep was rapidly recovered at such a high homologous temperature (> 0.5 Tm), which made 
the hardening and recovery rate equal to each other immediately.  Minimum creep strain rate 
is plotted as a function of applied stress for the Sn-3.5Ag alloy at the given four aged 
conditions in Fig. 4.  The stress exponent of minimum creep strain rate was calculated 
according to Norton’s power law [12]:   
 
min
nAε σ=&  (1) 
 
where A is a material constant, σ is applied stress, and n is the stress exponent and slope of 
each curve-fitted straight line in Fig. 12.  It has been recognized that the value of n is an 
index of creep deformation mechanism.  The stress exponent values for the given aged 
conditions are n = 7 for RT-30, n = 6 for RT-600, and n = 8 for both artificial aging of 120-3 
and 150-3.  According to the deformation mechanism map [13,14], the corresponding 
deformation mechanism for n from 6 to 8 was a type of dislocation creep.  However, 
compared with the stress exponent of pure Sn [15], the stress exponents of Sn-3.5Ag solder 
alloys in the given aged conditions are higher.  It can be attributed to the strengthening effect 
5 
condition and for all given aged conditions together. 
 
3.1.4.  Fractography Analysis 
 
Fractography analysis of the broken specimens indicated the final fracture was a ductile 
type and accompanied by considerable necking.  Examples of SEM micrograph of creep 
fracture surface for the given Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy at variously aged conditions under 
different constant loads are presented in Fig. 8.  A typical ductile-material type of microvoid 
coalescence feature was observed in these micrographs.  Figs. 8(a) and (b), respectively, 
show the creep fracture surface of samples after aging of RT-600 and aging of 150-3 under a 
lower applied stress.  It can be found that there is no significant difference in fracture surface 
between these two aged conditions.  However, in comparison of Figs. 8(c) and (d), the 
number of larger and deeper microvoids was greater for specimens aged at 150oC, 3 days 
under a higher applied stress. 
It was reported that the microvoids were usually formed at grain boundaries and 
matrix/intermetallic interfaces (MIIs) [18].  The nucleation of microvoids at MIIs was 
caused by an incompatibility of creep flow between the matrix and IMC [18].  Igoshev et al. 
[19] indicated that microvoids could be formed at the early stage of creep deformation and 
then lasting for a long period of time until the final fracture.  Under a higher constant load, 
formation of microvoids was easier such that growth and linkage of microvoids to become a 
critical crack was the life-determining process.  In this regard, larger microvoids were easily 
formed at the coarser Ag3Sn IMCs in the two given high-temperature aged conditions and 
took a shorter time to link up with each other and form a critical crack under a higher creep 
load.  As a result, the creep rupture times at high stress region for the cases of aging at 120oC, 
3 days and 150oC, 3 days were much shorter than that for the case of RT-600 aging, as shown 
in Fig. 5.  This might explain why fewer but larger/deeper microvoids were observed on the 
fracture surface of the case of 150-3 aging (Fig. 8(d)), compared to the case of RT-600 aging 
(Fig. 8(c)).  In other words, a higher applied stress would make the readily formed 
microvoids in the high-temperature-aged microstructure grow and coalesce faster than those 
in the naturally aged microstructure, as a larger highly-stressed area would be generated 
around the larger microvoids at coarser IMCs due to a stress concentration effect.  On other 
hand, under a lower creep load such as the lowest stress 11.6 MPa applied in the current study, 
the driving force for the microvoids to grow and link up with each other was smaller so that 
most of the creep lifetime was spent at the nucleation and early growth of microvoids at IMCs.  
In this regard, lots of small-sized microvoids were formed as compared to a smaller quantity 
of microvoids of larger sizes present in the specimens subjected to a higher creep load.  This 
can be seen by comparing Fig. 8(a) with 8(c) or Fig. 8(b) with Fig. 8(d) for a given aged 
condition.  As shown in Fig. 5, under a lower applied stress of 11.6 MPa, the difference in 
creep rupture time for each given aged condition became smaller.  Apparently, the IMC size 
generated a smaller extent of influence on the nucleation and early growth of microvoids for 
the given Sn-3.5Ag lead-free solder subjected to a small creep load.  Examples of the 
microvoids present on the circumferential surface of specimen for the given lead-free solder 
at differently aged conditions are shown in Fig. 9.  The existence of such microvoids 
provided evidence for the creep damage.

where D is the true fracture ductility.  As shown in Tables 4 and 5, it can be found that 
RA and D of the cast Sn-3.5Ag were increased in the high-temperature-aged conditions as 
well as under high-temperature tensile testing.  It indicated that the cast Sn-3.5Ag solder 
alloy had a better ductility under an artificially aged condition or high-temperature tensile 
testing. 
 
3.2.2.  Cyclic Stress-Strain Behavior 
 
Variation of tensile peak stress in each cycle with number of cycles under strain 
amplitudes of 1% and 0.2% are shown in Fig. 13 as examples of the RT LCF behavior for the 
given RT-300 lead-free solder.  In Fig. 13, each curve can be divided into three stages.  In 
the first stage, the tensile peak stress was rapidly decreased from the start of the test.  The 
first stage includes initiation and coalescence of microcracks as well as cyclic softening.  A 
steady reduction in tensile peak stress with cycles, indicating a stable fatigue crack 
propagation process [20], was present at the second stage in each curve of Fig. 13.  The final 
stage shows another rapid reduction of tensile peak stress due to formation and propagation of 
larger cracks to final failure.  In this study, the corresponding number of cycles for a 50% 
load drop from the initial tensile peak stress was defined as the fatigue life, as shown in Fig. 
13. 
The corresponding cyclic stress-strain hysteresis loops of the three aforementioned 
strain amplitudes at RT are shown in Fig. 14 for the given RT-300 lead free solder.  Plots like 
these were used to calculate the plastic strain range (Δεp) by subtracting the elastic strain (Δεe) 
range from the total strain range (Δεt) for each given strain amplitude.  The plastic strain 
range is equivalent to the width of hysteresis loop and was constant during the fatigue test 
until failure.  In this study, Δεp was determined from the hysteresis loop at half-life cycle and 
used in the following lifetime analysis. 
 
3.2.3.  Strain-Life Curve 
 
Fig. 15 shows the relationship between strain amplitude and reversals to failure at RT 
for the given RT-300 specimens.  Three types of strain amplitude were included in this plot: 
total, elastic, and plastic strain amplitudes.  It can be found that the plastic strain amplitudes 
are very close to the total ones except at the smallest strain amplitude.  It indicates that the 
LCF behavior was dominated by plastic strain.  Therefore, the Coffin-Manson relationship 
[21, 22] was applied for describing the LCF behavior in this study.  Fig. 16 shows the 
relationship between the plastic strain range and life at RT for RT-300 specimens.  In this 
plot, the LCF life can be well described by the Coffin-Manson relationship expressed by the 
fitted straight line.  By linear regression analysis, this fitted curve can be expressed by the 
following simple power law: 
 
0.85 10.16p fNεΔ =     for RT-300 at RT                                     (5) 
 
where the fatigue ductility exponent (α) is 0.85, the fatigue ductility coefficient (θ) is 10.16, 
and Nf is the number of cycles to failure.  The coefficient of correlation for this fitted curve 
is R2 = 0.98.  It is concluded that the Coffin-Manson relationship is quite applicable to the 
LCF behavior of RT-300 specimen. 
9 
were formed under cyclic loading.  These surface microcracks grew with increasing number 
of cycles and linked up to form large surface cracks.  When the large surface cracks were 
formed and started to propagate into the specimen, the required force under strain control was 
decreased due to a reduction of cross-sectional area of specimen.  The loading was steadily 
reduced during the crack propagating stage until final failure.    Figs. 19 and 20 indicated 
that the surface microcracks were initiated at the phase boundaries between β-Sn dendrite and 
eutectic phase.  Boundary steps due to difference in strength between β-Sn phase and 
eutectic phase could cause stress concentration and would be the reason for initiation of 
cracks in these sites.  In addition, at a high homologous temperature (0.6 Tm for the given 
lead-free solder at RT), the phase boundaries become weaker and boundary sliding can occur 
and provide a path for the growth of microcracks.  After a certain number of cycles, 
propagating microcracks linked up to form larger cracks mainly in a mixed mode of 
intergranular manner along boundaries between β-Sn phases and eutectic phases and 
transgranular manner through β-Sn phases or eutectic phases, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20.  
It can also be found that the difference in number of surface cracks observed between the two 
aged conditions (RT-300 and 120-3) was smaller for a strain amplitude of 0.2% (Fig. 28), 
compared to that for a strain amplitude of 1% (Fig. 20).  This might explain why the LCF 
life difference between the naturally aged condition and two artificially aged conditions was 
greater at a higher strain amplitude. 
 
3.2.5.  Temperature Effect 
 
The Coffin-Manson relationship of LCF life for the aging condition of RT-300 tested at 
RT, 60oC, 90oC, and 120oC is shown in Fig. 21.  The fitted curves for 60oC, 90oC, and 120oC 
can be expressed by the following equations: 
 
0.94 19.40p fNεΔ =    for RT-300 at 60oC                                     (8) 
0.99 19.55p fNεΔ =    for RT-300 at 90oC                                     (9) 
0.96 7.16p fNεΔ =     for RT-300 at 120oC                                   (10)   
 
where the values of R2 are 0.98, 0.96, and 0.96 for 60oC, 90oC, and 120oC, respectively.  
Apparently, the experimental data show an excellent agreement with the Coffin-Manson 
relation for each testing temperature.  Comparison of Eqs. (5) and (8) to (10) indicates that 
α values for LCF testing at high temperatures were greater than that at RT.  As shown in Fig. 
21, for a given plastic strain range, the LCF life was remarkably reduced at 90oC and 120oC, 
as compared to RT.  However, only a slight reduction in LCF life was observed at 60oC, as 
compared to RT.  It indicated that the two higher testing temperatures, 90oC and 120oC, had 
a greater effect on the LCF strength of the given Sn-3.5Ag than did the case of 60oC.  In 
general, the LCF life for the given lead-free solder was decreased with an increase in testing 
temperature. 
For the RT-300 specimens subjected to fatigue loading at 60oC, 90oC and 120oC, it has 
been shown in Figs. 11 and 12 that an in-situ aging effect did take place during LCF testing 
leading to the coarsening of β-Sn phases.  It is worthwhile to discuss how much this in-situ 
aging and coarsening effect contributed to the degradation of LCF strength at high 
temperatures for the given lead-free solder.  This can be found out by comparing the LCF 
testing results for the following three testing conditions: RT-300 specimens tested at RT and 
120oC, and 120-3 specimens tested at RT.  Note that the 120-3 specimens were prepared by 
artificially aging a set of RT-300 specimens at 120oC for 3 days before LCF testing at RT.  It 
can be seen that the difference in LCF life between RT-300 and 120-3 specimens tested at RT 
11 
dispersion-particle-strengthening mechanism (n = 6 - 8).   The creep strength for 
aging at 150oC, 3 days was lower than that for aging at 120oC, 3 days due to coarser 
IMCs even though the stress exponents in both cases were similar. 
(4) The experimental data showed an excellent agreement with the Monkman-Grant 
relation.  A unified Monkman-Grant equation was obtained to well describe the 
relationship between minimum creep rate and creep rupture time for all given aged 
conditions. 
(5) Coarsening of IMCs in high-temperature-aged microstructures can accelerate growth of 
creep microvoids under a higher applied stress.  However, the size of IMC had a 
smaller influence on the creep rupture time under a small creep load. 
(6) The tensile strength of a cast Sn-3.5Ag was reduced in high-temperature-aged 
conditions due to coarsening of β-Sn phases and IMCs.  The tensile strength was also 
decreased with increasing temperature due to a thermally activated softening process. 
(7) The LCF behavior of the given Sn-3.5Ag solder alloy at variously aged conditions or 
different testing temperatures could be well described by the Coffin-Manson relation. 
(8) Coarsening of β-Sn phases and IMCs in the high-temperature-aged microstructures can 
accelerate growth of microvoids at a higher strain amplitude.  However, the size of 
β-Sn phase and IMC had a smaller influence on the LCF life at a low strain amplitude. 
(9) For high-temperature LCF tests, the in-situ aging and coarsening effect was not the 
primary reason for the reduction of LCF strength.  A thermally activated process such 
as softening of the phase boundaries is likely to promote the fatigue crack initiation and 
propagation and reduce the LCF life at high temperatures.
