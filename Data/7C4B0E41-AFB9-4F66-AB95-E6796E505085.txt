Abstract 
Building renovations are usually performed as required based on inconvenience or damage that has already 
taken place. Construction practitioners are seldom aware of the relationships between all the related factors 
and their corresponding costs. The purpose of this study is to apply the self-organizing feature map (SOM) 
optimization based clustering (SOMOC) algorithm to building renovations so as to evaluate its feasibility and 
provide solutions. We collected 1056 sets of building renovation data sampled from 102 buildings. The 
SOMOC algorithm is utilized to expose the tendency in view of basic building features. The results suggest 
that the SOMOC method is feasible and effectively divides the data into 8 clusters for cluster analysis. In the 
subsequent discussion, findings imply that: (1) all clusters have similar distributions in terms of proportion of 
building age and building size, and thus, no rule can be formed for renovation practice; and (2) location, 
structure type, renovation frequency and cost are all related to each other. The benefits of the study not only 
prove the practicability of SOMOC but help the construction practitioners to learn from the past. 
Keywords: SOM, clustering, building renovation, construction management.

The self-organizing feature map algorithm was originally developed to model the brains’ computational 
maps [19]. The concept has been successfully applied in the engineering fields such as machine perception, 
controllers, communications, vector quantization, and cluster analysis [20]. Recently, scholars have modified 
SOM to deal with continuous optimization problems after which a new optimization algorithm named SOMO 
was proposed. To perform SOMO one follows four basic steps: initialization, winner finding, weight updating, 
and iteration [21]. In SOMO algorithm, after randomly initializing the weight vectors, it is assumed that each 
weight vector jw  represents a possible answer to the optimization problem. With the selection of the values 
for the initial weight vectors, )0(jw , the winning neuron 
*j  is found at time k using either the maximum 
output criterion or the minimum-distance Euclidean criterion. Therefore,

defined as a noise vector for the new weight vector. The last step involves iteration, which requires repetition 
of the winner finding and weight updating steps until pre-specified epochs are reached.  
 
2.2. Point Symmetry Measure 
It has been found in a previous study that point symmetry is not only feasible but effective for clustering 
[22]. Assuming that there are N patterns Nixi ,,1, L= ; a reference vector, or so-called cluster center, v , the 
point symmetry distance between jx and v can be defined as

However, a limitation, for example, to Equation (4) occurs when original data clusters themselves are 
symmetric. In other words, the PS measure is unable to cope with symmetric data clusters. A modification of 
the PS measure based on the fuzzy c-means (FCM) is proposed, and is named PSFCM [23]. In PSFCM, 
during the initialization process, c cluster centers cvvv ,, 21 K  are randomly selected using the FCM algorithm. 
Through the measure of the Euclidean distance, the centers are updated and data points are distributed to their 
nearest centers. We then use Equation (5) to locate the centers as follows:

item lists, we especially consider water linking and drainage as important here, since the climate in Taiwan is 
usually rainy and humid. This leaves us with 7 renovation items included in the following data sampling. 
The data sampled contain basic building information related to the afore-mentioned renovation items. 
Table 1 demonstrates the format for data collection which contains four types of basic building information 
and three types of specific renovation information. According to the principles of statistical data sampling, 96 
or more renovation samples are required to satisfy the assumptions of 95% confidence level and 10% limit 
error in a 50-50 category proportion [29]. Since the climate differs from place to place in Taiwan, we select 
data from the area with similar weather conditions.There are two counties and one city located in the 
investigation area. A total of 3240 sets of renovation data from 102 residential buildings located in the 
investigation area were sampled and collected. After deleting incomplete data points, we are left with 1056 
sets of renovation data for these 102 buildings. The sample size of 1056 collected data not only exceeds the 
aforesaid sampling principle in number but upgrades the limit error from 10% to near 5% [29].

In these 1056 sets of renovation records, the building age ranges from 1 to 15 years. Each renovation 
item makes up a proportion between 10% and 20% of the total. There is no single item that significantly 
dominates the others. However, 89% of the buildings are of the reinforced concrete (RC) type of structure. 
This type dominates all others in the building market, as is represented in the data samples. Investigated 
buildings are mostly located in either Taipei city or county, due to the population distribution. The most 
frequent renovation items involve water linking, HVAC, tile and wall, and hardware. These comprise the 
major items making up 87% of the total renovation costs. Figure 1 shows 6 charts of the aforementioned 
characteristics.

buildings located in Taipei City. Over one-third of renovation cost was spent on hardware. Construction 
practitioners might attach importance to different items because of different locations.  
With the comparison to the entire samples whose renovation items are approximately equally distributed, 
Cluster 1, 2, 3, and 6 clusters have their corresponding trends. We found that these trends to be associated 
with the costs. For Clusters 1, 2 and 3, each has a particular renovation item with significant high costs, 
greater than one third of the total. In Cluster 6, renovation costs for water linking dominated making up nearly 
half of the total although its renovation frequency is less than the average. It is not typical for construction 
practitioners and may be linked to the structure type, since the renovations all took place in RC or SRC types 
of buildings. These findings may assist renovation contractors in establishing a priority sequence and in 
budgeting for building renovations. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this work we examine the practicality of the SOMOC algorithm for use with construction renovation 
data. Data sampling over a wide area of northern Taiwan has satisfied statistical assumption at the 95% 
confidence level with a 10% limit error in the 50-50 category proportion. We sample 1056 sets of renovation 
records from 102 residential buildings. After incorporating the descriptions and implementing the steps of the 
SOMOC algorithm, the sampled data are subsequently assigned to 8 clusters. Basic analysis of the clusters 
leads to two major findings. First, building age and building size are irrelevant for building renovation. Based 
on comparison to the entire sampled data there is no particular rule related to building renovation. Second, 
location, structure type, renovation items, renovation frequency, and renovation costs are somehow tied to 
each other. Clusters 1, 2, 3 and 6 have high renovation costs for particular items. In Cluster 4 it is deduced that 
non-RC type buildings may have more problems with ceiling and painting. Analysis of Clusters 7 and 8 
reveals that location and structure type influence renovation items and costs. These findings are valuable 
indicators for practitioners conducting building renovations. In addition, the results indicate that the 
application of SOMOC to building renovation, a part of construction management field, is feasible. 
The proposed model is a tool for construction practitioners with restricted knowledge of the past in the 
building renovation industry. However, we present a few suggestions that may improve the current work. 
Other methods may be adopted for cluster analysis such as regression and data mining to formulate more rules. 
It should be possible to develop a hybrid model which would lead to a fully automatic model that could deal 
with the further needs of renovation practitioners. Currently the data sampling is limited to northern Taiwan 
but sampling throughout the country with the exploration of more detailed renovation factors is anticipated. 
Future studies are also suggested to apply SOMOC to other construction management related issues so as to 
benefit the practitioners.
