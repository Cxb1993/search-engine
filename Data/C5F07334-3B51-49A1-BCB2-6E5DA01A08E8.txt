1. Introduction 
High quality processes attract significant attention in the electronics industry 
today. In high-technology manufacturing, the nonconforming fraction p can be as low 
as several part per million. Traditional attribute charts such as the p chart and np chart 
are no longer suitable in automated high yield manufacturing. Chan et al. (2003) 
pointed out that the traditional p chart and np chart have four drawbacks. First, the 
binomial distribution cannot be approximated by the normal distribution. The false 
alarm probability will increase if the traditional three-sigma chart is used. Second, the 
calculated lower control limit (LCL) may be negative. Without a positive LCL, it is 
not possible to detect downward shift. Thirdly, the calculated upper control limit 
(UCL) of the np chart may be less than one, and that of the p chart is less than 1/n. In 
both cases, the occurrence of every single nonconforming item is a signal for 
out-of-control. This is clearly an over-reaction to noise. Finally, the signals for 
out-of-control from the p chart and np chart depend heavily on the choice of sample 
size. Thus, the monitoring and control of high yield processes are of growing 
importance. 
Calvin (1983) proposed plotting the cumulative counts of conforming units 
(CCC) control chart to deal with the zero defects problem. Goh (1987), Kaminsky et 
al. (1992), Glushkovsky (1994), Xie and Goh (1995) recommended a control chart 
that uses a cumulative count of conforming items to decide upon an out of control 
situation. This has been shown to be useful in high-quality manufacturing processes 
for monitoring the nonconforming faction. 
Xie et al. (2000) found that the average run length may increase at the beginning 
when the process has deteriorated (i.e. the nonconforming fraction p increases) when 
implementing the CCC chart. Normally, the values of ARL should decrease as p 
increases. Therefore, a longer time is required for an alarm to be raised when the 
nonconforming fraction increases. They proposed an adjustment factor to the CCC 
chart so that the control limits could be modified. Kuralmani et al. (2002) proposed a 
conditional decision procedure for the traditional CCC chart. Unlike the traditional 
CCC chart, which relies on a single run, this procedure considered previously 
successful sample runs to monitor the process changes. They proposed a conditional 
control procedure for the CCC chart to obtain a narrower control limit than the 
traditional CCC chart so that the small process shift can be identified more quickly. 
Noorossana et al. (2007) indicated that the run lengths in traditional CCC charts are 
independent Geometric distributions. However, the independence assumption does 
not satisfy the conditional procedure. The conditional procedure considers a certain 
number of previous observations. Hence, they proposed the modified ARL for the 
conditional procedure. Their method could estimate the ARL more precisely. 
2. Review of the CCC chart and conditional decision procedure 
2.1 The CCC chart 
The cumulative count of conforming units (CCC) chart was first introduced by 
Calvin (1983). Goh (1987) developed the CCC chart into a practical charting 
technique for high yield processes. The idea of the CCC chart is to plot and count the 
number of consecutive conforming items. The cumulative number is plotted against 
the sample sequence until a new nonconforming item is detected. We let X be the 
cumulative number of conforming items until the first nonconforming item occurs. 
Thus, X follows a Geometric distribution with a nonconforming fraction p and control 
limits can be set according to this probability. 
Since X belongs to a Geometric distribution with a nonconforming fraction p, its 
probability distribution function is 
                       f(x)= p (1-p)
x-1
,   x=1,2,... .                     (1) 
Its expected value, E(x)=1/p and cumulative distribution function is

Since the geometric distribution is skewed, the probability control limits are used. For 
a fixed α, the upper control limit (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) of CCC chart 
are:

In the CCC chart, when a count value is outside the UCL, the process might improve; 
when a count value is lower than LCL, the process might deteriorate. Xie et al. (2000) 
pointed out that the control limits of the CCC chart are highly asymmetric, and 
suggested taking the log-scale of the control limits for the CCC chart. 
By taking p=50 ppm and α=0.01 for example, the control limits of CCC chart are

Fig. 1 illustrates the plot of the CCC chart for the above example with simulated data. 
Each time, the cumulative number is plotted when a new nonconforming item is 
detected. All plotted points lie within the control limits. This represents that the 
process is in a controlled situation. 
By solving equation (7), we obtain the p value, where the ARL reaches the maximum, 
is

Equations (9) and (10) do not have a direct probability interpretation. However, the 
new control limits can be derived by multiplying the probability limits by a constant 
αγ (adjustment factor). Since the adjustment factor αγ  is purely a function of false 
alarm probability, the original process average remains unchanged for the new limits. 
 
2.3 The conditional decision procedure 
Kuralmani et al. (2002) pointed out that the CCC chart has been shown to be 
useful in manufacturing involving high quality processes. However, it relies on a 
single count value. A single value is not sufficient for detecting process shift. 
Moreover, the CCC chart is not sensitive to small process shifts. Therefore, it was 
proposed that some run rules can be incorporated into the traditional CCC chart 
procedure. The results of previously successful sample runs are considered to monitor 
the process changes. They proposed a conditional control procedure of the CCC chart 
to obtain narrower control limits than traditional CCC charts so that the small process 
shift can be identified quickly. To implement the conditional decision procedure, 
Kuralmani et al. (2002) firstly chose a fixed previous run s and a prescribed false 
alarm probability α and then derived the conditional limits in the following manner: 
2.4 Modified ARL equations 
Noorossana et al. (2007) indicated that the run lengths in traditional CCC chart 
are independent Geometric distributions. However, the independence assumption is 
not satisfied for the ARLcond in the conditional procedure. Conditional procedure 
considers a certain number of previous observations. Hence, Noorossana et al. (2007) 
derived conditional mathematical expectations incorporating pervious information 
and proposed the modified ARL for the conditional procedure as follows:

Comparing the modified ARL and conditional ARL for the conditional CCC chart 
reveals that the conditional ARL underestimated the true value of ARL. The modified 
ARL is more appropriate for the conditional CCC chart. 
Shu et al. (2007) mentioned that one-sided control charts would be more 
appropriate when the quality characteristic is asymmetric. We let X be the cumulative 
number of conforming items until the first nonconforming item occurs. Thus, X 
follows a Geometric distribution with a nonconforming fraction p. A geometric 
probability distribution is not symmetric with low p. Thus, we propose the design of a 
one-sided CCC chart and evaluate its performance. Other than that, the conditional 
decision procedure and the modification of ARL for the conditional one-sided CCC 
chart are also discussed. 
ARL1 is expected to be smaller for quick detection of the out-of-control situation. In 
this section, ARL is used to investigate the performance of the one-sided CCC chart. 
For the one-sided CCC chart, the ARL0 is set to be 1/α when the process is in 
control. The nonconforming fraction shifts from p0 to p1, when the process is 
out-of-control. We can calculate the type Ⅱ error, β, to obtain ARL1 of the one-sided 
CCC chart as follows: 
                      β=Pr(x>LCL)=(1-p1)

Xie et al. (2000) found that the ARL of a traditional CCC chart may increase at 
the beginning when the process has deteriorated. It takes longer for an alarm to be 
raised when the nonconforming fraction increases. In a one-sided CCC chart, the 
values of ARL decrease at the beginning when p increases. Thus, a one-sided CCC 
chart can immediately detect the shift of the nonconforming fraction as shown in Fig. 
4. For α=0.0027, 0.005 and 0.010, Table 2 shows the performance of ARL for various 
p. The process is considered in control for p=50 ppm. From Table 2, when p is greater 
than 50 ppm, the values of ARL are observed to decrease, regardless of the value of α. 
This appearance is more obvious for larger α in Fig. 4.

< Insert Fig. 4.> 
 
3.2 Design of conditional decision procedure for one-side CCC chart 
3.2.1 Conditional decision procedure for one-side CCC chart 
Kuralmani et al. (2002) proposed conditional decision procedures to incorporate 
previous runs into traditional CCC charts for quick identification of the small shift 
and to reduce type I errors. Thus, the conditional decision procedure is also 
considered for the proposed one-sided CCC chart. We let X be the cumulative number 
of conforming items until the first nonconforming item occurs. Thus, X follows a 
Geometric distribution with a nonconforming fraction p0. The cumulative distribution 
function can be found to be F(x)=1-(1-p0)
x
 . We let δ* be the probability that the 
process is in control, and (1-δ*) be the probability of out-of-control shown in 
following. 
                        Pinc=Pr(X≧LCL)=δ
*
                        (22)

*
                       (23) 
Based on the conditional decision procedure, the current observation run is 
considered in control if the previous s runs were inside the control limit even if the 
current run is outside the control limit. Fig. 5 shows that the current run is below LCL

For α=0.0027, 0.005 and 0.010, Fig. 6 shows the performance of ARL for 
various p when the previous run is 1 (s=1). The values of ARL decrease at the 
beginning when p increases in the conditional procedure of a one-sided CCC chart. 
Thus, the conditional procedure of a one-sided CCC chart can immediately detect the 
shift of the nonconforming fraction. 
 
< Insert Fig. 6.> 
 
The comparison of the ARL for a one-sided CCC with the conditional procedure 
of a one-sided CCC chart is shown in Fig. 7 when the previous run is 1 (s=1). The 
process is considered in control if the nonconforming fraction p is 50 ppm. From Fig. 
8, the ARL0 are seen to be both 370 for the two control charts. ARL1 for the 
conditional procedure (a dotted line) appears to decrease more rapidly as the 
nonconforming fraction p increases. Therefore, the conditional procedure of a 
one-sided CCC chart could detect the process shift more quickly. 
 
< Insert Fig. 7.> 
 
3.2.3 Modified ARL for one-sided CCC chart 
According to the study by Noorossana et al. (2007), the run lengths in the 
conditional procedure do not satisfy the independence assumption because previous 
observations are considered to determine the state of the process. They discovered 
that the ARL proposed by Kuralmani et al. (2002) always underestimates its true 
value.  
 Hence, we derive the modified ARL for the conditional one-sided CCC chart 
according to the methods of Noorossana et al. (2007). Since the modified ARL for the 
conditional two-sided CCC chart is 
4. The performance of the proposed methods 
4.1 Performance of one-sided CCC chart and its conditional procedures 
ARL is used as a measure for the performance of the conditional one-sided CCC 
chart. The nonconforming fraction p starts from 200 ppm to 500 ppm and the process 
is considered in control if the nonconforming fraction p is 200 ppm. The false alarm 
probability is 0.0027. The comparison between one-sided and conditional one-sided 
CCC charts is provided in Table 5 and Fig. 11. The modified ARL is used for the 
conditional procedure. 
From Table 4 and Fig. 10, ARL1 is seen to decrease as the nonconforming 
fraction p increases for both charts. The ARL of the conditional procedure decreases 
more rapidly than the ARL of a one-sided CCC chart. This means the conditional 
one-sided CCC chart is more sensitive than the one-side CCC chart. The conditional 
one-sided CCC chart is also found to be relatively useful in detecting process shift. 
 
< Insert Table 4> 
 
< Insert Fig. 10.> 
 
4.2 A numerical example 
To illustrate the use of a one-sided CCC chart and the conditional procedure, a 
set of simulated data, which record the cumulative number of items inspected until a 
nonconforming one, is observed, and is presented in Table 5. The first 15 data points 
are generated based on a nonconforming fraction p of 200 ppm. The next 15 points 
data are based on p= 400 ppm.   
 
< Insert Table 5> 
 
We can calculate the LCL of the one-sided CCC chart using equation (19). We 
obtain the LCL of conditional one-sided CCC chart using s=3 using equation (26).

The charts are plotted in Fig. 11. When the process nonconforming fraction has 
shifted to 400ppm, the conditional procedure can detect the shift quickly at the 5

5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have proposed a one-sided CCC chart and conditional decision 
procedure of a one-sided CCC chart for high quality processes. By using a one-sided 
CCC chart, the false alarm probability could be reduced, which was not possible using 
a two-sided CCC chart. A two-sided CCC chart results in an increase in ARL at the 
beginning even when the process has deteriorated. The ARL values of the proposed 
one-sided CCC chart decrease at once when the nonconforming fraction p increases. 
To detect the process shift more quickly, the conditional procedure of a one sided 
CCC chart is proposed. The results show that the ARL1 for a conditional procedure of 
a one sided CCC chart is smaller than those for a one-sided CCC chart. This means 
that the proposed conditional procedure methods could detect the shift more quickly 
than a one-sided CCC chart.  The ARL1 of conditional procedure is found to be 
slightly underestimated. Thus, the modified ARL for the conditional procedure is 
considered for the proposed methods. Finally, our conditional one-sided CCC 
procedure is simple to implement in manufacturing involving high yield processes.

一、 參加會議經過 
本次研討會由 Singapore Institute of Electronics舉辦之國際學術研討會，為
2012 科學與工程國際研討會（ 2012 World Conference on Science and 
Engineering）。該研討會主要以工程科學為主軸，於 2012年八月三日至四日於香
港富豪酒店（Regal Hotels）舉行。 
本次的國際研討會以工程科學相關的議題，大會提供一研究發表的平台，以
供各領域學者分享與研討工程科學的研究成果。在該學術會議中，更邀請美國、
馬來西亞、台灣等國際學者進行學術演講，針對工程與科學領域闡述目前的研究
範疇的發展。在本次國際研討會議中，於該會議中發表” A Fuzzy System for VSI 
X-bar Control Chart”，發表於” Industrial Engineering”研討議題中，本篇論文探討
以模糊系統建構 X 管制圖的變動抽樣方法，以模糊理論所建構的管制圖，能夠
有效的輔助製程的品質監控，該研究結合模糊系統於傳統的 X 管制圖，在模擬
的結果顯示以模糊系統為架構的 X 變動抽樣管制圖能有效的偵測製程變異，更
相較於傳統的管制圖有較佳的監控能力。此外，和參與國際研討會上與學者進行
詳細的討論，並共同交換學術研究意見。
