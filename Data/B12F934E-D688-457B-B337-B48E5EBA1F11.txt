 Developing a Customer-Oriented Organizational Diagnostic Model  
by Using Customer Complaint Database 
 
 
 
Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to develop a customer-oriented organizational diagnostic model by 
using the customer complaint database. Through reviewing the past literature on organizational diagnostic 
models, it was found that most researches were based on either consultants’ or organizational managers’ 
points of view to diagnose the service of organizations. Among the existing literature in the organizational 
diagnosis field, very few researches on diagnostic analysis of service systems were found with the basis of a 
comprehensive customer-oriented point of view. In order to fulfill the research goal, an organizational 
diagnostic model focusing on analyzing the customer complaints data in customer complaints databases is 
developed. The proposed model is titled as the “PARA model” and includes four diagnostic analytic stages. 
The four stages are: the ‘primary diagnosis’, the ‘advanced diagnosis’, the ‘review diagnosis’ and the ‘action 
diagnosis’. In the primary diagnostic stage, the customers complaint database is comprehensively analyzed. 
In the advanced diagnostic stage, a data mining technique is employed to investigate the cause-effect 
relationship between customers’ complaints and the deficiencies of the service system. In the review 
diagnostic stage, the weaknesses of the organization are reviewed. In addition, the awareness of weaknesses 
by the whole organization’s employee is examined. In the action plan diagnostic stage, the strategies and 
action plans for organizational improvements are developed. An empirical case study is conducted to 
demonstrate how the PARA model works and its implications.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In the highly competitive business environment, both 
manufacturing and service industries have paid much 
attention on meeting their customers’ needs in their products 
or services. Customer satisfaction is always one of the most 
important key performance indicators to judge the degree of 
an organization or an enterprise’s success. However, 
regardless of the enormous improvement efforts made, 
organizations always find it challenging to achieve high 
customer satisfaction rates, and it is always hard to eliminate 
all the defects or shortcomings that cause or may cause 
customer dissatisfactions and complaints. As we know, 
customer satisfaction could be influenced by many factors, 
such as the functions of a product, the diversity of service 
itself, customer’s individual needs, and the service quality 
from service personnel, etc. In particular, even a fully 
customer-focused service program cannot eliminate product 
or service failures completely during the delivery process. 
Most organizations are aware that it is a serious issue if 
service failures are handled inappropriately. In such cases, 
there are further harms on the organization’s goodwill and 
profits (Hart et al., 1990). In order to remedy the service 
failures in the service delivery process, organizations usually 
take certain action for service recovery to prevent from the 
loss of customers (Blodgett, 1977; Kelley and Davis, 1994; 
Sparks and McColl-Kennedy, 2001). ‘Service recovery’ refers 
to an organization taking compensation strategies and actions 
timely to regain customers’ satisfaction when product or 
service failure has happened during the delivery process 
(Zemke and Bell, 1990). An appropriate service recovering 
action could bring help for the organizational service 
 improvements. Consultants seek to clarify the nature of 
service failures in the organization and to develop a 
preliminary view on the organizational strengths and 
weaknesses. In the second diagnostic step, investigators use 
the theoretical frames to organize core problems or challenges 
and use the result as a reference to examine other parts of the 
organization. In the third diagnostic step, consultants develop 
one or more focused models from the conditions sustaining 
ineffective outcomes or shaping the organization’s ability to 
meet critical challenges. In the fourth diagnostic step, 
consultants provide clients with their feedback, which is cast 
in terms of the emergent diagnostic model. The diagnostic 
model needs to be formed while considering the following 
factors: time, resources, reward, and information feedback to 
the organization. Authors hold that sharp-image diagnosis 
intends to bridge theory and practice by drawing a broad 
spectrum of organizational theory and research, yet also by 
responding directly to the distinctive conditions shaping 
organizational operations and options for changes. The 
outcome of sharp-image diagnosis is a model that provides 
clients with a highly focused, multi-dimensional image of 
conditions underlying basic problems and critical challenges. 
The second aspect of organizational diagnostic model is 
to view organization as an open system. According to the 
open system perspective, any group or organization can be 
viewed as a system obtaining inputs from its environment, 
processing these inputs, and producing output. Open system 
theory posits that systems have certain common operating 
principles, including their tendencies to run down if not 
provided with additional resources from the environment and 
their tendencies to retain a state of equilibrium if not 
disturbed (Ashmos and Huber, 1987). The open system 
framework consists of seven system components: inputs 
(investments and resources), output (production), system 
processing (technology and transformations), environment 
(the task environment), structure, culture, and system 
dynamics. The open system framework can contribute to 
diagnosis in several important ways. First, the open system 
framework is widely applicable because it is possible to 
analyze any focal organization, subunit, or set of 
organizations in terms of the flows of inputs, the processing 
of these inputs, and the creation of output. Second, it leads 
consultants and managers to adopt a holistic approach by 
examining the overall environmental and organizational 
contexts within which problems arise and within which steps 
toward organizational improvement are enacted (Jackson, 
1992). Third, it can help consultants and clients deal with the 
complexity of organizational performance and change and 
thereby resist the temptation of management fads. Fourth, 
system-based diagnosis can help consultants and clients 
distinguish symptoms of ineffectiveness from underlying, 
systematic causes. Fifth, it alerts consultants and their clients 
to look for possible side effects of actions-unanticipated and 
hard-to-diagnose consequences that can alter the status quo 
within the system (Senge, 1990). There are also significant 
limitations on the use of the open system frame in diagnosis 
and in management development. For example, some of the 
system laws and principles are too abstract to be useful in 
research and consultation, which might lead the investegators 
to make some underlying assumptions that bias the 
investigator toward a particular view of organizational 
conditions before these conditions have been investigated 
empirically. A further limitation of the open system frame is 
that its very universality and abstractness can lead researchers 
and consultants to adopt a superficial approach that overlooks 
important details of organizational operations and ignores 
significant differences among organizations and among 
organizational contexts. 
The third aspect of organizational diagnostic model is to 
treat an organization as political arenas in which bargaining 
and exchange take place among internal and external 
stakeholders. Political frame regards an organization as an 
arena in which competitive, non-competitive, internal and 
external stakeholder associations coexist. These stakeholder 
associations harbor the special benefit or goal (Bolman and 
Deal, 1991; Hall, 1987; Morgan, 1986). The stakeholders’ 
involvement in the activities of organization could result in 
harm or benefit either for themselves or the organization 
(Donaldson and Preston, 1995). The main stakeholder and the 
organization maintain official contract relation and have 
direct economical influence on the organization. The 
secondary stakeholder includes all parties who will influence 
the organization and be influenced by the organization 
(Savage et al., 1991). Stakeholder analysis can balance the 
authority distribution between the internal and external 
stakeholder associations to prevent the authority of 
stakeholder association from influencing diagnosis result. 
This stakeholder association includes shareholder, staff, 
customer, and manager etc. The stakeholder is analyzed 
according to the following steps (Savage, 1991): (1) confirm 
main stakeholder; (2) inspect each stakeholder's position; (3) 
examine stakeholder's power; (4) examine each individual 
stakeholder’s capacity for action; (5) appraises different 
stakeholder's impact and so on. Political frame emphasizes 
interpersonal relationship within organization and the 
possible conflicts among stakeholders. The stakeholder's 
activity usually affects decision with regard to budget or other 
forms of resource distributions (Bartunek, 1993). Although 
this model has considered customer's authority, it lacks an 
operational model with concrete procedures and it is hard to 
consider all stakeholders’ opinions from different 
perspectives. 
The fourth aspect of organizational diagnostic model is 
to use the customer complaints as the driven force for 
organizational improvement. Bosch and Enriquez (2005) 
developed a customer-oriented diagnostic analysis model. 
 
 will result in some action rather than be intimidated by the 
experience of complaining. (2) Processing - the organization 
must have systems and procedures in place to deal with 
people and their expressions of dissatisfaction. These systems 
include seamless transfer between functions and levels within 
the organization as well as the appropriate resources to ensure 
the systems are capable of delivering to specified standards. 
(3) Outcome - the quality improvement imperative which 
underlies the capture and processing of complaints data is to 
ensure that lessons are learned and improvements may be 
identified in the design and delivery of services. 
Getting along with this line of thinking, the present 
authors hold that a further proactive approach needs to be 
adopted in dealing with the VOC. A customer-oriented 
organizational diagnostic model focusing on comprehensive 
analysis of customer complaint database is then developed in 
this study. The proposed model, which is called the “PARA 
model”, divides the diagnostic procedure into four stages 
including the ‘primary diagnosis’, the ‘advanced diagnosis’, 
the ‘review diagnosis’, and the ‘action diagnosis’. In the first 
stage, the “primary diagnosis” executes data classification 
and frequency analysis on original customer complaints. In 
the second stage, based on the data classification done in the 
primary diagnosis, the “advanced diagnosis” adopts the data 
mining technique and develops strategies for improvement 
and action plans. The third stage, the “review diagnosis”, is to 
review the organization’s weaknesses found in the first two 
stages and the organization’s employees’ awareness on the 
weaknesses is examined. In the fourth stage, which is the 
“action diagnosis” stage, strategies and action plans for 
improvement are developed. Figure 1 represents the 
conceptual framework of the PARA model. The details of 
each stage of PARA model is described as follows.

 4.2.1 Primary diagnostic analysis 
  
In the part of diagnosis analysis, the attention was 
centered on the dimensions of service quality measurement in 
which service failure was seen most often. We extracted 497 
themes from customers’ complaint database of the agency by 
utilizing content analysis. Then those themes were classified 
into five dimensions of service quality measurement. To 
ensure the reliability of classification, 20% of the themes 
were randomly sampled. It is found that the indices of the 
degree of mutual agreement between the researcher and each 
of the two coders are 0.864 and 0.771. The reliability is 0.92. 
According to the research of Kassarjian (1977), if the 
reliability of context analysis was greater than 0.70, the result 
of the analysis would be highly reliable. The reliability of this 
study is 0.9, which is acceptable. 
Based on Table1, the service failure on the dimension of 
tangibles accounts for 40.44%, which is the largest; the 
dimension of empathy is 23.54%; the dimension of assurance 
is 20.12%; the dimension of responsiveness is 11.07%. 
In terms of the dimensions of tangibles, empathy, 
assurance, and responsiveness, customers’ complaint 
categories were researched. Table1 shows the result of the 
analysis of customers’ complaint categories. First, the 
dimension of tangibles shows that most of the customers’ 
complaint could be classified into the following four 
categories: environmental safety (28.4%), maintenance of 
public facilities (18.9%), environmental hygiene (16.4%), 
viatical bottleneck (14.9%); Next, the dimension of empathy 
shows that most of the customers’ complaint could be 
classified into the following two categories: lack of a 
customer-oriented service (72.6%) and failure to provide 
personalize service for customers (18.8%); furthermore, the 
dimension of assurance shows that most of the customers’ 
complaint could be classified into the following two 
categories: unfriendly attitude of staff (66%) and social right 
and public welfare (27%); finally, the dimension of 
responsiveness showed that most customers’ complaint could 
be classified into the category, delayed response (98%). 
In terms of the total number of complaints received, 
Table 1 shows that lack of customer-oriented service account 
for 17.1%, which is the largest; next, unfriendly attitude of 
staff is 13.28%; furthermore, the environmental safety is 
11.47%; finally, delayed response is 10.87%. Therefore, from 
the information above, it could be seen that service failure 
deserves the most attention.

In addition, unfriendly attitude of staff and traffic 
violation appeal statement each have appeared four times in 
all rules. Although these categories do not have the highest 
confidence, they are repeatedly shown in service failure, 
which need attention. Therefore, focusing on these rules, this 
study aims to implement review diagnosis and develop 
strategies for improvement and action plan.

4.2.3 Review diagnostic analysis 
  
In terms of review diagnosis, this study used the result of 
advanced diagnosis to develop strategies for improvement 
and action plan and reviewed employees’ awareness of 
weakness in the organization. For improving efficiency of 
service system, how to utilize customers’ complaint and 
further developing strategies and action plans for 
improvement of appropriate to customers’ needs is an 
important issue for organization. In order to fulfill this 
purpose, the philosophy of this study is based on the aprior 
analysis results of Table 2 and Table 3, the 13 strategies for 
improvement and action plan was developed through what 
researcher discussed with staff of the agency in Table 4 shows. 
Next, the sectors from which most of the customers’ 
complaint came from were chosen, which were engineering 
sector and cleaning sectors in the public agency. We focused 
on 13 strategies for improvement and action plan in the 
discussion with the high level managers, the mid level 
managers, and the base level staff. This discussion can help 
us understand employees’ awareness of weakness in the 
organization. Meanwhile, we could increase face validity and 
construct validity to make up the deficiency of 13 strategies 
for improvement and action plan.  
The result of Table 4 shows that employees of the two 
sectors agree with 1 to 12 strategies for improvement and 
action plan, which can help employees to establish awareness 
of weakness. In the case of survey customers’ needs 
periodically cannot achieve more than half, it was chosen by 
three employees. Therefore, this strategy was eliminated. This 
result shows that this research has adequate face validity and 
constructing validity, which present these 12 strategies can 
help organization to improve efficiency of service system. 
  
4.2.4 Action diagnostic analysis 
  
In terms of action diagnosis, this study used the result of 
the Table 3 and 13 strategies for improvement and action plan 
to implement relationship matrix calculating. 
The relationship matrix calculating used the equation (2) 
to calculate importance weight, and the different relationships 
between the subject of customers’ complaints and strategies 
for improvement and action plan are coded by the researcher 
and other two coders, and that we got indices of the degree of 
mutual agreement between the researcher and each of the two 
coders are 0.9 and 0.9. The reliability is 0.9. Next, we make 
use of the codes to calculate importance weight (e.g. 9, 3, 1, 
and 0) in Table 5. For instance, the benchmark learning and 
rule A-3 with a-b-c code show that present benchmark 
learning can eliminate service failure seen in the dimensions 
of responsiveness, tangible, and empathy.

holder relationships. Bryson (2004) has indicated that there is relatively little in the public and nonprofit literatures on exactly how to 
systematically identify and analyze stakeholders.  
In order to resolve this dilemma, a public policy analytic model is developed in this paper by using Mitchell’s theory as the 
conceptual framework. Mitchell et al. (1997) proposed a theory of stakeholder identification and salience which intended to generate a 
typology of stakeholders from three relationship attributes: power, legitimacy, and urgency. However, Mitchell et al. and other scholars 
only proposed the conceptual definition and classification of stakeholder and didn’t develop an operational analytic procedure on the 
public policy. The model proposed in this paper is involved a two-stage and two-layer analytic procedure and can clarify the point and 
degree of conflict among multiple stakeholders. Finally, in order to demonstrate the procedures of the proposed analytic model, an 
empirical case study which involves the decision of the no. 5 national highway construction in Taiwan is conducted. 
 
2. CONCEPTS AND MODELS OF STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT 
Since Freeman published his landmark book in 1984, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, the concept of “stakeholders” has 
become embedded in management scholarship and in managers’ thinking. Hence, for more than a decade the stakeholder approach to 
understanding the firm in its environment has been a powerful heuristic device, intended to broaden management’s vision of its roles and 
responsibilities beyond the profit maximization function to include interests and claims of non-stockholding groups (Mitchell et al., 
1997). There is not much disagreement on what kind of entity can be a stakeholder. Persons, groups, neighborhoods, organizations, 
institutions, societies, and even the natural environment are generally thought to qualify as actual or potential stakeholders (Mitchell et 
al., 1997). Freeman’s definition stakeholder is this: “A stakeholder in an organization is any group or individual who can affect or is 
affected by the achievement of the organization’s objectives.” Thompson et al. (1991) define stakeholders as groups “in relationship with 
an organization.” Windsor (1992) correctly points out that stakeholder theorists differ considerably on whether they take a broad or nar-
row view of a firm’s stakeholder universe. Hill and Jones (1992) speak of stakeholders as contractors or participants in exchange 
relationships. 
A review of the literature of the past decade reveals three major models for delivering stakeholder management: (i) the conceptual 
model; (ii) the social–network model; and (iii) the cause–effect model. Each of these is discussed below. 
2.1 The Conceptual Model 
This model attempts to develop a conceptual framework to deliver stakeholder management. For example, Donaldson and Preston (1995) 
present the three aspects of stakeholder theory—descriptive/empirical, instrumental, and normative— found in the literature and clarify 
the critical differences among them. Descriptive/empirical theory is used to describe, and sometimes to explain, specific-corporate 
characteristics and behaviors. For example, stakeholder theory has been used to describe the nature of the firm (Brenner, 1991), and the 
way managers think about managing (Brenner, 1977). Instrumental theory, in conjunction with descriptive/empirical data where 
available, is used to identify the connections, or lack of connections, between stakeholder management and the achievement of traditional 
corporate objectives (e.g., profitability, growth). Normative theory is used to interpret the function of the corporation, including the 
identification of moral or philosophical guidelines for the operation and management of corporations.  
Mitchell et al. (1997) proposed a theory of stakeholder identification and salience based on stakeholders possessing one or more of 
three relationship attributes. They lay out the stakeholder types that emerge from various combinations of the attributes: power,

2.4 Summary of the literature 
According to the past literature reviewed above, it is found that the term stakeholder has assumed a prominent place in public and 
non-profit management theory and practice in the last 20 years, and more especially so in the last decade. As Bryson (1995) 
acknowledges, attention to stakeholders is important throughout any strategic management process because “success” for public 
organizations depends on satisfying key stakeholders according to their definition of what is valuable. Similarity, as Rainey (1997) 
argues, “Public agencies are born of and live by satisfying interests that are sufficiently influential to maintain the agencies’ political 
legitimacy and the resources that come with it”. If key stakeholders are not satisfied, at least minimally, according to their criteria for 
satisfaction, the normal expectation should be that something will change — for example, budgets will be cut, elected or appointed 
officials will lose their job, new initiatives will be undermined, and so on (Bryson, 2004). However, until relatively recently the question 
of what the public sector added for the benefit of the variety of stakeholders was largely ignored (Ferlie et al., 2003). Consequently, 
Bryson (2004), citing the work of Nutt (2002), explains that failure to attend carefully to stakeholder interests and information can easily 
lead to disaster. More specifically, there is still a paucity of research that clearly articulates how to systematically identify and analyze 
stakeholders, or how to manage the various complex and often competing stakeholder relationships (McAdam et al., 2005). Hillman and 
Keim (2001) also suggest that the “processes by which stakeholder relations are managed and the balancing of diverse demands of 
stakeholder groups are ripe areas for further inquiry”. Although Mitchell et al. (1997) proposed a theory of stakeholder identification and 
salience, but it only offers a conceptual analysis model. An analytic operational model needs to be developed for the purpose of practical 
use. This study therefore attempts to develop a public policy analytic model to identify the degree of conflict dilemma of a public policy 
by using Mitchell’s theory as the conceptual framework. In order to demonstrate how the proposed model works, a policy analysis for the 
no.5 national highway construction in Taiwan is chosen as the subject of the empirical case study. 
 
3. RESEARCH FRAMEWORK 
The present study used the theory of stakeholder identification and salience which was proposed by Mitchell et al. (1997) to develop a 
public policy analytic model. This model employs a two-stage and two-layer analytic procedure. The framework of the model is shown 
in Figure 2. The first stage is the attribute analysis of stakeholders, which is from the viewpoint of stakeholders possessing attributes 
(power, legitimacy, or urgency) to analyze stakeholders’ attitude and opinion (support, neutrality or opposition) with regard to the public 
policy and the issues they concerned. The second stage is the salience analysis of stakeholders, which analyzes the public policy and 
issues they concerned from the viewpoint of stakeholder salience (latent, expectant or definitive stakeholder). 
In the two-layer of this model, first layer is the main part of the model which contains stage 1 and stage 2, which was mentioned 
above. The second layer is the stakeholder type analysis, which is the auxiliary part of this model. Layer 2 mainly conducts an analysis 
on the attitude and concerned issues of the seven types of stakeholders based on the attribute and salience of stakeholder analysis. 
The public policy analytic model proposed in this study could help public managers to identify multiple stakeholders of the public 
policy, and to understand their attitudes, concerned issues, and conflict points. Due to the attitudes of stakeholders may be different and 
their concerned issues may be distinct too, there are 14 possible conflict points in this model. In regard to the definition of conflict point, 
please refer to section 3.6. Finally, based on the amount of conflict point, this study divides the conflict degree into five levels including 
high conflict, middle and high conflict, middle conflict, middle and low conflict, and low conflict. The main content of the research

category by acquiring just one of the missing attributes. If the stakeholder is particularly clever, for example, at coalition building, po-
litical action, or social construction of reality, that stakeholder can move into the “definitive stakeholder” category (characterized by high 
salience to managers), starting from any position—latent, expectant, or potential. 
3.3 Stakeholder Type 
There are seven stakeholder types that emerge from various combinations of the attributes: power, legitimacy, and urgency. The seven 
stakeholder types indicate (Mitchell et al., 1997): (i) dormant- the relevant attribute of a dormant stakeholder is power. Dormant 
stakeholders possess power to impose their will on a firm, but by not having a legitimate relationship or an urgent claim, their power 
remains unused; (ii) discretionary- discretionary stakeholders possess the attribute of legitimacy, but they have no power to influence the 
firm and no urgent claims; (iii) demanding- demanding stakeholders, those with urgent claims but having neither power nor legitimacy, 
are the “mosquitoes buzzing in the ears” of managers: irksome but not dangerous, bothersome but not warranting more than passing 
management attention, if any at all; (iv) dominant- in the situation where stakeholders are both powerful and legitimate, their influence in 
the firm is assured, since by possessing power with legitimacy, they form the “dominant coalition” in the enterprise (Cyert and March, 
1963); (v) dependent- stakeholders who lack power but who have urgent legitimate claims as “dependent,” because these stakeholders 
depend upon others (other stakeholders or the firm’s managers) for the power necessary to carry out their will; (vi) dangerous- Mitchell 
et al. (1997) suggest that where urgency and power characterize a stakeholder who lacks legitimacy, that stakeholder will be coercive and 
possibly violent, making the stakeholder “dangerous,” literally, to the firm; and (vii) definitive- stakeholder salience will be high where 
all three of the stakeholder attributes—power, legitimacy, and urgency—are perceived by managers to be present. 
3.4 Stakeholder Attitude 
Stakeholder attitude mainly explores the attitude and opinion of stakeholder to the public policy, which can be divided into: (i) Support: 
stakeholders keep a supporting, approval or positive attitude for a public policy; (ii) Neutrality: stakeholders keep a neutral attitude for a 
public policy. Their attitude doesn’t clearly present nor have any inclining on approval or opposition; (iii) Opposition: stakeholders hold 
an opposition attitude on a public policy. They present the disapproval or negative attitude for a public policy’s execution. 
3.5 Concerned Issue of Stakeholder 
This part lays stress on understanding the public issues stakeholders are concerned about. In the public policy analytic model of this 
study, relevant pubic issues can be set in accordance with the researcher’s choice on the public policy. For instance: a budget issue or 
armament replacement issue can be set for the public policy of national defense; as for the traffic public policy, issues related with 
economic development can be set. And then Issue A, Issue B, and Issue C will be taken as cases in this research framework. 
3.6 Stakeholder Conflict Level 
This part aims to make a quantity analysis on the conflict phenomena in the stakeholder attribute analysis, stakeholder salience analysis 
and stakeholder type analysis so as to understand the overall conflict degree of a public policy. The conflict degree of this study can fall 
into five levels: (i) high conflict: overall stakeholder conflict point is from 12 to 14; (ii) middle and high conflict: stakeholder conflict 
point is from 9 to 11; (iii) middle conflict: stakeholder conflict point is from 6 to 8; (iv) middle and Low conflict: stakeholder conflict 
point is from 3 to 5; (v) low conflict: stakeholder conflict point is equal to or less than 2. 
The study defines stakeholder conflict point as: when stakeholders have different attitude to a public policy or concern about 
different issues, the conflict point will be generated accordingly. For example, there will be no conflict point if various stakeholders

5.2 Reliability Analysis 
Considering the preciseness of research result, at first the researcher and two additional coders conducted the reliability test of content 
analysis aiming at stakeholder type classification, concerned issues classification and stakeholder attitude classification before analyzing 
the data. Since the indices of the degree of mutual agreement1 between the researcher and two coders, and the reliability index2 are all 
more than 0.7 in Table 2, it presents the classification result of content analysis in this study is reliable.

5.3 Stakeholder Attribute Analysis 
Stakeholder attribute analysis of stage 1 mainly explores attitudes and concerned issues on the no. 5 national highway construction of 
stakeholders of different relationship attributes. In Table 3, this study found the attribute and attitude of stakeholders have no significant 
conflict phenomena.

Table 4 is the concerned issues analysis of stakeholders of different attributes. This study found concerned issues of stakeholder of 
different attributes give priority to the decision making process, and there is no significant variance on other issues. In summary, 
stakeholder’s attribute doesn’t generate significant conflict phenomena on attitude and concerned issues.

Table 9 is the cross analysis of type and attitude of stakeholder with legitimate attribute. It presents the discretionary and definitive 
stakeholders mostly keep a neutral attitude, but dominant and dependent stakeholders mainly hold a supporting attitude; therefore there is 
a conflict phenomenon on attitude to the no. 5 national highway construction among all stakeholders with the legitimate attribute.

Table 10 shows a cross analysis aiming at legitimate attribute and concerned issue of stakeholder further. Stakeholders with 
legitimate attribute have different attitudes on concerned issues. For example, discretionary and definitive stakeholders are concerned 
about issues on ecological environment protection more than the other two types of stakeholders.

In Table 11, stakeholders with urgent attribute have different attitudes and opinions on the no. 5 national highway construction. For 
example, definitive and demanding stakeholders have a similar attitude, and dangerous stakeholders support the highway construction 
least, but dependent stakeholders support the construction most.

Table 12 presents a cross analysis on type and concerned issue of stakeholder with urgent attribute. Stakeholders with urgency 
attribute don’t have the same kind of concerned issues on the no. 5 national highway construction. For example, demanding stakeholders 
only concern about issues of decision making process, but dangerous stakeholders are concerned about issues on ecological environment 
protection, dependent stakeholders pay attention to economic development issues, and definitive stakeholders care for issues of decision 
making process.

Table 16 presents a cross analysis on type and concerned issues of expectant stakeholder further. As Table 16 shows, dangerous 
stakeholders lay emphasis on issues of ecological environment protection, however, dominant and dependent stakeholders pay less 
attention to this issues, and they are concerned about issues of decision making process and economic development respectively. In brief, 
expectant stakeholders of different types have conflict phenomena on their concerned issues.

6. ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF STAKEHOLDER CONFLICT  
Through several decades of endeavor, Taiwan’s democracy degree has made much progress and development, arising of local public 
opinion also shows the voice of local public has got closer to the central core power of decision making gradually. When government 
agencies are establishing public polices, not only issues on policy formulation (such as time limitation, necessity etc. of a policy) should 
be taken into consideration, but also demands and voices of different stakeholder groups must be known and noticed, and requirements of 
multiple stakeholders should be satisfied in a fair and reasonable principle. 
The public policy analytic model established in this study can detect totally 14 conflict points of stakeholder demand from the 
viewpoints of relationship attribute (power, legitimacy, and urgency) owned by stakeholder and stakeholder salience class (dormant, 
expectant, and definitive stakeholder). With regard to the definition of conflict point, please see Section 3.6. According to the data 
analysis, there are 12 conflict points in the case of the no. 5 national highway construction. Based on the public policy analytic model 
proposed in this study, the construction project belongs to the pubic policy of high conflict (please see Table 17). Since the conflict 
phenomena of the no. 5 national highway construction project have accumulated for a long time and haven’t attracted attention and been 
dealt with, it should solve the stakeholders’ conflicts phenomenon immediately. In addition, definitive stakeholders will produce an 
immediate influence on an organization for they have all three stakeholder attributes (Mitchell et al., 1997). In this empirical case study, 
definitive stakeholders (such as central government agencies, directors of the central ministries) have the direct power to decide 
establishment of public policies, since people also endow the public policy with legitimacy, establishment of public policy will affect 
rights of people, this type of stakeholders have quite a lot urgency attribute. So their demand should be concerned immediately. 
Expectant stakeholders are the stakeholder who has two attributes. According to opinions of Mitchell et al. (1997), since this type of 
stakeholders have two kinds of stakeholder attribute, they will turn to be the definitive stakeholders and produce a great influence on an 
organization as long as they own the third attribute further. Therefore they suggested activity of this type of stakeholders must be 
concerned carefully. Expectant stakeholders in this empirical case study include dangerous stakeholders (such as environment protection 
groups), dependent stakeholders (such as local tourism associations and syndicate), and dominant stakeholders (such as local government 
agencies). 
At last, latent stakeholders are the stakeholder who has only one attribute, although they won’t have an instant effect on an 
organization, their demand still needs continuous attention. In this empirical case study, this type of stakeholders involves dormant 
stakeholders (such as scholars), discretionary stakeholders (such as the local citizens) and demanding stakeholders (such as construction
