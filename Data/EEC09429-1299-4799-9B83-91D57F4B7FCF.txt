ABSTRACT 
Smooth steel bar is the mostly used material type as dowels. However, corrosion is a 
significant problem for the steel bars in wet or alkaline environments. Once the steel bars in 
concrete corrode, the volumes of steel expand and would cause damage to the adjacent concrete 
slab. Therefore, alternative dowel materials have been introduced in recent years. The major 
objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) 
dowels for load transfer in jointed concrete pavements. Several types of GFRP dowel sections 
are considered: concrete or cement grout-filled, round and elliptical tubes in addition to solid bar. 
Material tests will be first conducted to determine the material properties, shear strength and 
bending strength of GFRP material. Then specimens contain two dowel bars and two jointed 
concrete slabs in each one will be made and tested under static loading in order to evaluate the 
performance and effectiveness of pavement joints with different dowel sections.  It is found that 
both concrete and cement grout as the filling materials can increase the lateral stiffness of GFRP 
tubes.  Besides, performance of pavement joints with GFRP dowels is good, and the joint 
effectiveness can reach 97% and higher.

一、前言 
根據估計設有綴縫筋的接縫式混凝土路面的使用年限可達未設有綴縫筋的接縫式混
凝土路面的 2.5 倍【1】，然而傳統的鋼筋綴縫筋因為有發生鏽蝕而加速混凝土路面破壞之
疑慮，因此尋求合適的綴縫筋替代材料是一個值得研究的課題。由相關研究文獻中已知玻
纖複材因其有耐腐蝕、高強度、材料穩定性高、種類繁多而且在混凝土中的拉拔力低等優
點，所以是混凝土路面綴縫筋的可能替代材料。但是玻纖複材的彈性模數低、材料價格較
鋼筋昂貴且材料本身韌性不如鋼材，是否真正合適用來取代鋼筋綴縫筋仍是一個問題。因

實驗；第三類實驗則是路面版實驗。各類實驗的項目與條件如表 2 所示。 
路面版實驗是本年度計畫最重要的實驗。一共製作了六組路面版試體，分別採用實心
鋼棒、實心玻纖複材棒、內部灌漿玻纖複材圓管（灌混凝土及水泥砂漿）以及內部灌漿玻
纖複材橢圓管（灌混凝土及水泥砂漿）等作為綴縫筋，綴縫筋的長度均為 50cm。每組試體
包含兩塊混凝土路面版，中間以兩根綴縫筋作為剪力傳遞裝置，綴縫筋的間距採用一般常
用的 30cm，混凝土版厚度參考國道設計採用 30cm【6】。因為受實驗儀器及實驗室各項配
合條件之限制，混凝土路面版寬度以 60cm 為限，兩塊混凝土路面版中的施力版設計為僅
有 20cm 的長度，而傳力版的長度為 60cm，路面版用的混凝土設計抗壓強度僅 280 kg/cm2，
比實際路面版強度略低。此外，以鋼製彈簧模擬路基支承，每根彈簧的彈簧常數為 890 
kN/m，此彈簧支承的強度不及實際之碎石級配料，所能提供的路基反應係數（回彈模數）
經估計約為 60 MN/m3【7】。路面版試體尺寸及彈簧支承配置如圖 1 及圖 2 所示。載重以
靜態漸增方式施加於試體中的施力版鄰近接縫處，載重以每根綴縫筋承受約 12kN 為基準
（施加在施力版上的總力為 24kN），以模擬 80 kN 等值單車軸輪重施給一根綴縫筋的力
【5】；最大載重則為每根綴縫筋承受 30kN（總力 60kN），估計約為最大可能輪重【3】。
實驗時同時量測兩塊路面版的表面位移。 
四、試驗結果與討論 
4.1 材料實驗 
(a)玻纖複材的實驗結果 
玻纖複材的抗拉強度及抗壓強度如表 3 所示，而實驗試體破壞情形如圖 3 所示。由試
驗結果可知玻纖複材的抗拉強度比抗壓強度高，拉力彈性模數也比壓力彈性模數高。實驗
過程中發現即使抗壓試體發生嚴重破壞而有很大的變形，在壓力去除後試體幾乎是立即彈
回原先的長度。 
(b)填充材的抗壓實驗結果 
填充材分為混凝土及水泥砂漿，兩者的抗壓強度均超過 330 kgf/cm2（4700psi）（表 4）。
由試驗結果可知配比良好的砂漿抗壓強度很高，而混凝土因玻纖管材內徑不大，所以採用
較小粒徑之粗骨材，強度僅比水泥砂漿強度略高一點。 
(c)路面版混凝土的抗壓實驗結果 
一組路面版試體有兩塊混凝土版，長度較長的版上承受模擬車輪重的壓力，本研究稱
之為施力版，而較短的版的力則是經由綴縫筋將施力版上的力傳遞過來，此版稱為傳力版。
為方便模版之釘製及拆除，兩塊版分兩批灌製，兩批混凝土的抗壓強度相差不大，都有 310 
kgf/cm2（4400psi）以上（表 5），且都高於設計值。 
4.2 綴縫筋的剪力及彎矩實驗 
 5
1. 玻纖複材的抗拉強度很高，抗壓、抗剪和抗彎的能力也不錯。但是因為勁度較低，所以
受力後會產生較大的變形。但是一旦將外力卸除，變形就會立即回復。 
2. 由於玻纖複材的勁度較低，因此以玻纖複材作為綴縫筋的路面版會有比採用鋼筋綴縫筋
的路面版更大的變形，但是變形量應在可接受的範圍。以本研究計畫所採用的最大載重
60kN 為例，即使路面版下方是較軟弱的路基支承（彈簧支承），變形最大的路面（採
用實心玻纖複材桿綴縫筋）也僅有最大 7.5mm 左右的撓度。 
3. 以混凝土或水泥砂漿作為管型材的填充材料皆有良好的效果，但是混凝土填充較為不
易。建議後續可以嘗試其他填充材料，或選用較低強度的混凝土或水泥砂漿，評估不同
強度的填充材料對內部灌漿的複材綴縫筋傳力效率的影響。 
4. 在靜態荷重作用下，本研究計畫選用的實心或內部灌漿的空心玻纖複材綴縫筋都有極佳
的傳力效率，E 值幾乎都能達到 97%以上，其中尤以空心複材圓管內填砂漿的效果最
佳。建議後續繼續反覆荷重實驗，更進一步評估玻纖複材綴縫筋的適用性。 
5. 以彈簧支承取代碎石級配路基乃因實驗室條件限制所採用的替代方式，若是實驗室或儀
器設備並無限制，仍應以碎石級配作為路基材料才能更正確的模擬實際情形。

ABSTRACT 
This paper presents a nonlinear finite element model developed by ABAQUS for the 
analysis of steel-concrete composite beams.  The concrete slab and steel beam are modeled by 
layered shell elements so that various geometry of composite beams can be effectively account 
for.  The verification of the analysis model is conducted by comparing the predicted results by 
the proposed model with the well-chosen experimental/analytical results obtained from other 
researches.  Four influence factors, including amount of shear connectors, compressive 
strength of concrete, amount of rebar, and load-support distance, are under consideration in two 
series of composite beam analysis.  The analysis results show that the amount of shear studs 
and the strength of concrete significantly influence the capacity of composite beams under 
positive bending moment, while the amount of rebar influences the capacity of composite beams 
under negative moment evidently.  Different load-support distances may cause different failure 
types of the composite beams.

Simulation of Contact Interface 
The contact conditions between elements of same material (concrete to concrete or steel to 
steel) or of different materials (concrete to steel) are dealt with by different ways.  The 
displacements of nodes belonging to adjacent layers of elements with the same material must be 
compatible.  In this case, the *MPC option is used to impose constraints between nodes.  
Because the friction between steel and concrete interface is not under consideration in the 
analysis model, slightly slip occurring between layer surfaces is allowed.  However, the surface 
of any steel element or concrete element can not penetrate each other, so the *CONTACT 
PAIRS option must be implemented.  Each shear stud is represented by applying a connector 
element to join a node of concrete element to the adjacent node of steel element. 
Boundary Conditions 
After several tries of analysis, it is evident that in order to get reasonable analysis, vertical 
supports of a beam must be assigned at the neutral plane.  Figure 1 illustrates a simply 
supported steel beam modeled by three layers of shell element.  If the supports allocate at 
neutral plane, the predicted results of both reactions and maximum stress coincide with the 
theoretical values, and the difference between predicted maximum deflection and the theoretical 
one is 3.2% only.  However, if the beam is supported at the bottom layer, analysis results differ 
from the theoretical values by a significant deviation (Table 1).  The same situation can be 
found for a composite beam (Figure 2).  The result analyzed by the proposed model and the 
data obtained from other research differ with each other by 20% if the composite beam is 
supported at the bottom.  But they are quite similar for the composite beam supported near the 
neutral plane.  In addition, the failure pattern at maximum load as shown in Figure 2 (b) 
contains very limited area with concrete cracks and steel yielding.  Once the supports are 
moved to locations close to the neutral plane of the composite beam, the error reduces to -2.3%, 
and the failure pattern becomes reasonable (Figure 2 (c)). 
VERIFICATION OF ANALYSIS MODEL 
Four cases were chosen from four previous papers by other researchers (Sebastian 2000, 
Nie and Xiao 2004, Liang 2004, Nie and Fan 2004) to verify the accuracy of the developed 
analysis model. Case I and Case II are simply supported composite beams, while Case III and 
Case IV are three-span continuous beams (Figure 3).  The section properties and material 
properties of all cases are listed in Table 3 and Table 4.  Since the composite beams of all four 
cases are symmetrical in both longitudinal and lateral directions, one quarter of each of the 
structures was analyzed.  In order to investigate the influence of post-crack behavior of 
concrete as mentioned earlier, four values of ε

, 8 × 10

each analysis case.  The analysis results are summarized in Table 5.  Data in Table 5 show 
that for all cases except Case I, the predicted values vary significantly as the value of ε
t
u
 is 
changed.  The deviation between predicted values analyzed by the proposed model and results 
from other researches could be minimized if ε
t

.  Case I is the one composite beam with 
the entire beam under positive bending moment, and the other cases all encounter negative 
bending moment in some region or even the entire beam.  Therefore, the analysis results of 
composite beams under negative bending is definitely more sensitive to the value of ε
t
u
.  In 
general, the degree of accuracy of the proposed analysis model is acceptable if a value of ε

why higher compressive of concrete make no improvement in the ultimate strength of composite 
beams under negative bending. 
Influence of Amount of Rebar 
As seen in Figure 8, more rebar does not increase the ultimate strength of the cases in 
Series I because concrete itself can provide high resistance to compression resulting from 
positive bending moment.  However, the more rebar is applied, the higher ultimate strength can 
a composite beam resist for cases under negative bending since rebar plays the main role to 
provide tension capacity in a reinforced concrete slab. 
Influence of Load-Support Distance 
Bending moment becomes larger with the increase of load-support distance.  Therefore, 
load-support distance is an importance factor influencing the capacity of both series of analysis 
(Figure 9).  When the load-support distance is large, failure of the composite beam would be 
moment controlled, otherwise, the beam is shear controlled.  Some research has indicated that 
if load-support distance is less than twice of the depth of composite section, the beam fails in a 
brittle way controlled by shear (Nie and Xiao 2004).  By examining the results listed in Table 7, 
it can be found that if load-support distance is only 360mm, the predicted bending moment 
capacity is only 72% of the nominal moment and the predicted shear force is more than twice of 
the nominal shear strength.  This composite beam obviously fails by excessive shear before the 
nominal bending moment is reached.  The situations of cases with load-support distances of 
480mm and 600mm are similar.  That is to say, these beam are also shear controlled.  The 
overall depth of the composite section analyzed in Series I is 320mm, therefore, load-support 
distance less than twice of the overall beam depth would cause composite beams fail by shear.  
This results coincides the findings illustrated by the above-mentioned research.  On the other 
hand, only Case I-O and Case I-D9/8 fail at bending moments similar to the design strength, and 
the shear forces of both cases do not exceed the design shear strength.  Therefore, these cases 
with load-support distance larger than three times of the overall depth of composite section are 
bending controlled. 
It can be also seen from Table 7 that most cases of Series I display larger shear strength 
than the design shear strength calculated by design formula.  This result suggests that the 
design formula specified in steel design specimen, neglecting he concrete shear strength, seems 
to under-estimate the actual shear strength of composite beam. 
All cases in Series II display a similar value of ultimate bending moment, which is about 
13% greater than the design bending moment calculated according to design specification 
(Table 7).  Besides, almost all cases except for case II-D2/7 (the load-support distance is 
relatively small) undergo smaller shear forces than the nominal shear strength at failure, which 
implies that most of the composite beams under negative bending are bending moment 
controlled.  Because concrete slabs lose their resistance due to tensile stresses due to negative 
bending, the bending moments of all cases are provided mainly by the same steel section and the 
same amount of rebar.  That explains why the ultimate bending moments for all cases approach 
a certain value.  Moreover, the larger bending moment suggests that totally neglecting concrete 
tensile strength in determining bending moment of a composite beam under negative bending, as 
specified by design specification, leads to a over-conservative design.

(Fischer, 2006; Hilti, 2000).  The strength of most commonly used adhesives is relatively high 
and they often provide excellent bonding effect.  However, the quality of commercial products 
and the capacity of workers might result in different performance of post-installed rebar.  
Furthermore, unlike the studies on the behavior of adhesive anchor bolts or the cast-in place 
rebars, researches focused on post-installed rebar setting are relatively limited in number. 
There are several typical failure modes that may occur when adhesive rebars in concrete 
are subjected to tension: bond failure, concrete spalling failure, and steel fracture failure (Cook  
2002).  Rebar systems exhibit different failure modes show different levels of capacity.  
Among the many influencing factors of failure modes and capacity, the effects of embedment 
length, edge distance, concrete strength and adhesive mortar are more significant (Chen 2001).  
This study was carried out by means of pull-out test of rebars to: 
y determine the embedment length required to achieve ultimate strength of rebar system; 
y understand the effect of edge distance, concrete strength of rebar system; 
y observe the variations between the rebars fastened by different adhesives; 
y evaluate the acceptance of two design approaches. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
96 adhesive bonded rebars which were divided into 32 sets were tested.  The parameters 
of experimental test are summarized as follows: 
Loading type: monotonically static tension 
Diameter of rebar (d): 9.5 mm (#3 deformed steel bars) 
Compressive strength of concrete (f ’c): 20.7 MPa (3000 psi) and 27.6 MPa (4000 psi) 
Embedment length (hef): 120 mm, 90 mm, and 60 mm  
(about 12 d, 9 d, and 6 d, respectively) 
Edge distance (c): 1.0 hef, 0.75 hef, 0.5 hef
Test Materials 
Based on the limited capacity of the testing equipment, only #3 steel deformed reinforcing 
bars were used.   The nominal diameter is 9.5 mm, which gives a nominal cross-sectional area 
of 71.33 mm
2
.  Two orders of ready-mix concrete with design compressive strength of 20.7 
MPa and 27.6 MPa were cast in-situ as the base material.  Two brands of adhesives (so called 
Adhesive I and Adhesive II herein) were selected as the bonding material.  These adhesives are 
both two-component injection type with epoxy resin and hardening agent. These materials need 
to be extruded with the aid of a mixing gun.  All the above-mentioned materials used to 
prepare the test specimens were obtained from the same batch to minimize variations between 
samples. 
Specimens 
There were four blocks of concrete cast in-situ.  Each two of them were made by the same 
order of concrete.  The size of each concrete blocks as shown in Figure 1 is 2000 mm long 
1800 mm wide  400 mm deep.  These molds for the concrete blocks were made by wood 
formwork.  Two special design boards (1800 mm long × 200 mm deep, with a thickness of 80 
mm) were inserted and fixed at the locations 600 mm and 700 mm away from the longitudinal 
附件二
desired tensile force which is then applied to the test specimen.  The reading of force is 
indicated with a dial gauge to an accuracy of 1.0 kN.  
Testing Procedure 
8 to 12 hours after rebars were setting into concrete by the adhesive, pull-out tests were 
carried out (ASTM 2003, EOTA 2001).  The extraction tester must be centered over the bars 
and the supporting posts of the machine must be uniformly contact the concrete surface.  In 
case that the bar to be tested was very close to an edge, some extra metal pieces were used to 
provide surface for the supporting posts (Figure 5).  Static tests were conducted by a loading 
rate about 8 kN/min (25% of estimated ultimate capacity of rebar per minute) (ASTM 2003) 
until failure occurred.  Maximum load and failure mode were recorded for each testing bar, and 
radius of concrete cone projection was measured if the failure contained a concrete stress cone. 
TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Ninety-six specimens were divided into two series of tests.  Series I used Adhesive I and 
Series II used Adhesive II.  Each series contains two groups since there are two batches of 
concrete.  Table 3 and Table 4 indicate the test results of series I and series II, respectively. 
Investigation of Failure Types 
There were six different failure types observed in the experimental program (Figure 6). 
Among them, steel fracture failure happened most frequently (figure 7).  Near half of the 96 
specimens display such failure mode, and the percentage raised to 62.5% for the specimens with 
embedment length not less than 90 mm, and to 75% for those with hef = 120 mm.  Another 
more frequent failure mode is combined concrete cone-bond failure (Figure 8): 27% among all 
specimens and 66.7% among specimens with hef = 60 mm. 
Only 3% of specimens failed by displaying full depth concrete cone (Figure 9), these rebars 
were either installed with shallow depth or with small edge distance.  Concrete spalling (Figure 
10) is another failure mode seldom occurred in this program.  It is a failure type for small edge 
distance only, and the proportion is only 16.7% even among the specimens installed within a 
distance of 45 mm to one edge of concrete. 
Bonding effect of both adhesives seemed very good because only about 15% of the 
specimens induced bond failure (Figure 11).  Thread damage failure (Figure 12), strictly 
speaking, is a man-made defect rather than regular rebar failure. 
Influence of Concrete Strength on the Capacity of Rebar System 
Theoretically, if the strength of rebar system is controlled by concrete, higher concrete 
strength causes higher capacity.  Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not obvious in this 
experimental program except for the specimens with smaller embedment length and edge 
distance (Table3 and Table 4).  There are two reasons: one is that the actual strengths of two 
orders of ready-mix concrete did not differ from each other as expected, and the other one is that 
most specimens with larger embedment length and edge distance failed by steel fracture. 
附件二
The difference between the predicted values and the test results becomes obvious when the 
edge distance is small.

INTRODUCTION
When concrete is subjected to elevated temperatures, concrete undergoes a series of 
changes in its chemical composition and physical structure.  These changes can be visually seen 
in the form of surface cracks, spalling, and even disintegration.  As a result, concrete gradually 
loses its mechanical strength and durability, and even more the concrete structure would become 
unserviceable (Ellingwood 1991, Bazant 1996).  During last 30 years, some studies of concrete 
with post-fire-curing had already been reported in the literatures.  It was reported that 
fire-damaged concretes could regain its strength if they are properly re-cured.  Crook and 
Murray (Crook 1970) first found the strength of concrete after fire was substantially reduced, but 
when concrete blocks were soaked in water for a short time, the original strength was regained.  
The strength regain was mainly due to re-hydration process reducing the porosity of concrete. 
These phenomena of strength regain and re-hydration had already been confirmed by some 
researchers (Harada 1972, Khoury 1992, Sarshar 1993, Lin 1996).  In a recently study, Chi-Sun 
Poon, Salman Azhar, Mike Anson and Yuk-Lung Wong (Poon 2001) indicated that the effect of 
water-curing was more pronounced than that of air-curing.  The re-hydration rate for 
water-curing was rapid during the first 7 days and then slowed down but the re-hydration rate for 
air-curing was slow and gradual.  Besides, they observed that concrete specimen exposed to 
600°C could acquire a better strength and durability recovery than that exposed to 800°C.  They 
further mentioned that concrete could recover its strength and durability with proper re-curing 
alone without the need of special rehabilitation if the temperature of the concrete was kept below 
600°C.  
However, these past studies were mostly conducted on concrete cylindrical specimens and 
could not be generalized for reinforced concrete beams.  It was shown (Chen 1998) that the 
flexural strength, flexural stiffness, and shear strength of RC beams are reduced considerably 
after exposure of fire.  In many worse cases, fire-damaged concrete structure may become 
unserviceable or sharply loses its mechanical strength and durability.  There is a need to 
conduct a comprehensive investigation to understand the effects of re-hydration on the strength 
and stiffness recovery of fire-damaged concretes beam.  Although the fire-damaged concrete 
beam may regain its strength if it is properly re-cured, concrete beam may not completely 
recover its original strength or it may usually take too long to wait the strength recover to 
original strength.  Thus, except post-fire-curing, repairing or rehabilitation may still be required 
for some circumstances such that concrete structure can earlier recover its original strength and 
functions.  Recently, there is great potential for strengthening concrete structures with external 
bonded carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The main reasons of CFRP prevalence lie in 
the superior and unique physical property such as high strength, high stiffness to weight ratio, 
anticorrosive, easy for tailoring and suitable for bonding to the surface with more complicated 
geometry.  Some researchers (Saadatmanedh 1991, Ritchie 1991, Al-Sulaimani 1994, 
Alfarabi 1994) had already investigated the behaviors of reinforced concrete 
beams strengthened with FRP plates.  These studies all indicated that FRP retrofitting 
can significantly increase both the strength and ductility of damaged concrete structures.  
Consequently, a parametric study was carried out in this paper to investigate the behaviors of 
fire-damaged reinforced concrete beams with post-fire-curing and CFRP retrofitting.  
附件三
beams with post-fire–curing but without CFRP retrofitting under flexural loading test.  The 
curves in both figures showed a similar trend.  As the load began to act on the specimen, the 
curve was roughly going up with certain slope, then the curve turns into that of more slower 
slope after the load reached to the first peakWhen the load exceeded about half of maximum 
load, the tension cracks first appeared in two sides and near the soffit of beam, thereafter the 
cracks grew up continuously.  While the load was reaching up to the supreme, inclined cracks 
of 45 degrees developed at the supports of beam.  As the deflection of beam was increasing to 
its maximum, these cracks continued and extended further into the top of beam in the middle of 
span, which resulted in crushing of concrete beam and failure of beam finally.

Figure 2  Load versus deflection diagram of fire-damaged RC beams with water curing 
附件三
Besides, the initial slope of load - deflection curve is proportional to the flexural stiffness 
of beam.  It was observed in Figure 1 and Figure 3 that the initial slopes of all beams cured in 
air were not obviously increased, which means air curing would not result in a substantial
stiffness recovery.  Whereas Figure 2 and Figure 4 showed that flexural stiffnesses of all beams 
cured in water were recovered gradually with curing age, but they were not significant as 
compared to the recovery of flexural loads.
Pre-study of Post-fire-curing and Retrofitting Effects 
This section mainly discusses the post-fire-curing and retrofitting effects of fire-damaged 
RC beam exposed to 600ഒ environment for 30 minutes.  First, different curing processes were 
described and the comparison was made to know the curinginfluence on the ultimate flexural 
load regain of beam.  Two kinds of CFRP retrofitting schemes, which included soffit and 
U-jacket retrofitting, were subsequently considered to upgrade the loading capacity of beam after 
beams were post-fire-cured.  The effects of different CFRP retrofitting schemes were 
investigated to determine the optimal retrofitting scheme.  Besides, different periods of water 
sprinkling would be tested to determine the optimal period of water sprinkling. 
The ultimate flexural loads of fire-damaged beams before heating, immediately after 
cooling, and after 7, 30, and 90 days of curing were shown in Table 1.  The test results clearly 
indicated that the ultimate flexural load of fire-damaged beam cured in air rose first at 7 days of 
curing, decreased at 30 days of curing and gradually resumed going up.  On the other hand, all
the beams cured in water showed a substantial ultimate load recovery after recurring and the load 
recovery rose up gradually with curing age.

It was found that the decrease in the ultimate load of beam with 30 minutes of fire 
exposure time was notapparent and thus the curing effects were not very obvious no matter what 
curing process.  It was concluded that the recovery of strength and stiffness would be more 
pronounced if period of fire exposure time or curing age increased.  Consequently, period of 
fire exposure time would increase to 120 minutes, water sprinkling was suggested to be seven 
days, curing age would also be increasing and retrofitting scheme would be U jackets in the 
subsequent main study. 
Post-fire-curing Effects on RC beam Without Retrofitting 
This section mainly focuses on the post-fire-curing effects of fire-damaged RC beam 
exposed to 600ഒ environment for 120 minutes.  It was first found that the reduction in loading 
capacity of fire-damaged beam was from 84.8% (Table 1) down to 64.7% (Table 2), which 
means more substantial reduction in loading capacity was observed when RC beam exposed to 
fire environment for longer period.  Besides, the results of different curing process were 
described in the following and the comparison between two processes is made to know the 
post-fire-curing effect. 
Table 4 showed the ultimate flexural load of fire-damaged beam cured in air kept 
decreasing for first 30 days and then gradually going up with curing age.  The percentage of 
load increase due to air curing for 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 270 days of curing was 0.2%, 
8.4%, 22.5%, 23.1% respectively.  The increase in ultimate load was slow and gradual.  Table 
4 also showed the ultimate flexural load of fire-damaged beam cured in water rose up with 
curing age.  The percentage of load increase due to water curing for 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 
270days of curing was 37.8%, 49.7%, 52.6%, 51.6% respectively.  The rate of load increase 
was rapid during the first month and then continued at a slower rate.  Besides, Table 4 showed 
that the initial slope of curves increased gradually for all beams with curing age. Thus, the 
stiffness recovery was increasing with curing age, which was more obvious for water curing.

curing and not related to curing ages.  It was also found that the increase percentage in ultimate 
load of beam with CFRP retrofitting was decreasing as curing age was increasing. 
Table 5 also showed that the initial slopes of curves increased gradually for all beams with 
curing age, which indicated curing resulted in a substantial stiffness recovery.  The stiffness 
recovery was also better for water curing.  Thus, the effect of water curing was more 
pronounced and much better than that of air curing when CFRP retrofitting was considered.  It 
was suggested that the fire-damaged beam had better be cured in advance by way of sprinkling 
waterbefore CFRP retrofitting was made.
CONCLUSIONS 
A number of experimental studies had already been organized to analyze the retrofitting 
behaviors of fire-damaged reinforced concrete beams strengthened by post-fire-curing and 
CFRP.  The experimental results from both of fire exposure time all indicated that the ultimate 
flexural load of fire-damaged beam cured in air kept decreasing for first 30 days and then 
gradually raised up, while that of beam cured in water rose up gradually with curing age.  The 
rate of load increase for water-curing was rapid during the first month and then continued at a 
slower rate while the rate of load increase for air-curing was slow and gradual.  All beams 
cured in water had better performance in strength and stiffness recovery than those cured in air.  
The flexural load of fire-damaged beam cured in air could not reach 80% of original beam 
capacity until 270 days of curing, but that of beam cured in water already approached the 
original beam capacity after 90 days of curing.  Besides, CFRP retrofitting could significantly 
increase the strength of fire-damaged concrete beams.  The effect of water curing was more 
pronounced and much better than that of air curing when CFRP retrofitting was considered.  
The ultimate loads of fire-damaged beams cured in water and strengthened by CFRP all 
approached the ultimate load of unfired beam with CFRP retrofitting, no matter what curing 
ages are.  It is suggested that fire-damaged beam can recover its original loading capacity if it 
was cured in water with at least 3 months curing age.  In addition, fire-damaged beam can 
recover and exceed its original loading capacity if it was cured in advance by way of sprinkling 
water before CFRP retrofitting is made.
