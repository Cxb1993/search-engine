should relentlessly improve the processes 
and products by various methods and tools 
(Kondo, 2001; Chen et al., 2004). Quality 
function deployment (QFD) is one of the 
very effective quality systems tools typically 
applied to fulfill customer requirements and, 
more importantly, improve customer 
satisfaction (Chan and Wu, 2002; Wu, 2002, 
2002-03; Kuo and Wu, 2003). For most 
organizations, HOQ, depicted in Figure 1, is 
typically used instead of the entire four 
phases of QFD since it links the voice of the 
customer to technical measures through 
which detailed processes and production 
plans can be developed in the other phases 
of QFD (Chan and Wu, 2002-03). The 
foundation of HOQ is that products should 
be designed to meet customer needs so the 
marketing department, design engineers, and 
manufacturing staffs should work closely 
together from the time the product is first 
conceived (Tan and Shen, 2000; Hauser and 
Clausing, 1988). The procedures of HOQ 
implementation include (1) customer needs 
(WHATs), (2) planning matrix, (3) technical 
measures (HOWs), (4) relationship matrix 
between WHATs and HOWs, (5) technical 
correlation matrix, and (6) technical matrix.

Fuzzy Preference Relation 
Li (1999) has proposed an improved 
fuzzy preference relation to solve the 
previous drawback, and a fuzzy model 
associated with the solution algorithm is 
suggested on the basis of an α-level 
weighted. Finally, a stepwise-described 
algorithm of the fuzzy model is presented 
simply as the following (Li, 1999): 
Step 1: Define the linguistic terms as 
triangular fuzzy numbers. 
Step 2: Aggregate fuzzy weights through all 
judges by means of extended 
addition and scalar multiplication to 
form comprehensive weight vector 
W, in which weight

{VW, W, M, S, VS} for the relationship between 
CR and TM. 
In Step 2, aggregate fuzzy importance 
weights for each CR through five customers 
by applying Equation (1). The fuzzy 
importance weights of these three customer 
requirements are provided in Table 1. Step 3 
is to aggregate fuzzy relationship between 
CR and TM, applying Equation (2), through 
the cross-functional team members, and the 
fuzzy relationship is obtained. In Step 4, a 
weighted and comprehensive decision 
matrix, depicted in Table 2, can be 
established by applying extended 
multiplication discussed in Equation (3), 
where qmf denotes quadratic membership 
function listed as follows:

Step 5 is to define each technical 
measure as a fuzzy number iTM  with i = 1, 
2, 3, 4, and 5 by Equation (4). The 
mathematical computations of these five 
technical measures are in the followings. 
1TM =3.143qmf=(0.324, 1.433, 1.386 /3.143/
