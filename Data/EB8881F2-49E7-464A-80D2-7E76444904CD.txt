2. Abstract—This paper proposes a wide-locking range divide-by-3 
injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) fabricated in the 90nm 
1P9M CMOS technology. The divider consists of an nMOS 
cross-coupled LC oscillator and two injection MOSFETs in series 
with the cross-coupled nMOSFETs. The ILFD is formed with two 
linear mixers which share the same dc current so that a low power 
ILFD can be designed. At the supply voltage of 0.7 V, the 
free-running frequency is from 10.18 to 11.56 GHz, the current and 
power consumption of the divider without buffers are 2.8 mA and 
1.96 mW, respectively. At the incident power of 0 dBm, the total 
operational locking range is 4.74 GHz, from the incident frequency 
29.96 to 34.70 GHz. 
Keywords: CMOS, VCO, divide-by-3 injection-locked frequency 
divider, wide locking range, transformer. 
 
3. Introduction 
Injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFDs) are widely used as 
the sub-blocks of phase locked loop (PLL) and carrier recovery 
blocks. A popular ILFD is the LC resonator based circuit because the 
operating frequency can be very high and it consumes low power, 
and the center operation frequency of LC-tank ILFD is less sensitive 
to process variations than the inductor-less ILFDs. The 
even-modulus ILFDs include divide-by-2 [1-2] and divide-by-4 [3-4] 
circuits and the odd-modulus ILFDs include divide-by-3 circuits

is applied to one port of the first mixer, and the output of the second 
mixer is fed back to the other input port of the first mixer through a 
filter. The input/output frequency relation is given by ωRF − 2ωo=ωo 
for the divide-by-3 function. Using this approach might lead to a 
large locking range because of linear mixer. The use of two mixers 
can increase the dc power so the second mixer is stacked in series on 
the first mixer in the proposed circuit, so that dc current can be 
reused and a lower power ILFD can be implemented. 
 
4. Circuit Design 
Figure 2 shows the circuit for CMOS divide-by-3 ILFD used in 
this work. The circuit consists of a cross-coupled pair Mn1 and Mn2, 
which provide negative transconductance to compensate for the tank

consumption. An external balun T1 is used to convert a single-ended 
input from a signal source to differential signal. The injection signal 
is applied to the gate of injection MOSFET with dc gate bias Vg. In 
the free running operation where no injection is applied, the ILFD is 
a VCO with a fundamental oscillation frequency fo. The varactors 
are used for frequency tuning. The voltage Vtune is used to tune the 
capacitance of varactors and the oscillation frequency. 
 
5. Measurement Results 
The proposed circuit has been implemented in the retrograde 
twin-well UMC 90nm 1P9M CMOS technology and the chip photo

1.0 V, and VDD= 0.7 V, with a total locking range is 3.45 GHz, from 
9.15 to 12.6 GHz. Figure 9 shows the measured relationship between 
input sensitivity and operating frequency for the proposed circuit 
used as a divide-by-5 ILFD under the condition of Vtune=0.0 V, 1.0 V 
and VDD = 0.7 V, with a total locking range is 6.96 GHz, from 50.68 
to 57.64 GHz. The function of 1st ILO can be described using the 
schematic shown in Fig. 1(b) which can not be used to describe the 
function of divide-by-5 ILFD. The mixers in the ÷5 ILFD are 
nonlinear. 
 
6. Conclusion 
  This paper proposes a wide operation and wide-locking range ÷3 
ILFD employing two transformers, and the injection MOSFETs are 
used as mixers, in which one input signal is transformer-coupled 
from the ILFD output and applied to the source and the other input 
signal is applied to the gate. The ILFD circuit has been successfully 
implemented in the UMC 90nm 1P9M CMOS technology and has a 
good performance of lower power, and large locking range. In the 
ILFD the switching transistors are used as linear mixers. The 
varactor tuning is also used to extend the operation range of the 
ILFD. The die area is 0.4374 mm2. The implemented ÷3 ILFD core 
consumes power of 1.96 mW at the supply voltage of 0.7V, and the 
operation range is 4.74 GHz, from 29.96 to 34.70 GHz.

second inductor is laid out with the 3, 2 and 1 metal 
layers. The transformer is laid out so that the 
secondary coil lies inside the primary coil. The metal 
trace-to-trace parasitic capacitance is minimized to 
maximize the operation frequency. Symmetric layout 
of the primary and secondary inductors is required for 
the differential operation, and it is not necessary for 
the primary to be symmetric with respect to the 
secondary. Port 1/Port2 is placed at the top metal 
(metal 6), Port3 is at the metal 4, while Port 4/Port5 is 
located in the metal 3 and Port6 is at the metal 1. The 
transformer is simulated by using the simulation 
tool-ADS Momentum and Spectre RF to get its related 
model parameters. The simulated Q-factor and 
inductance of the primary transformer at 5 GHz are 
about 4.762 and 1.723 nH, respectively. The Q-factor 
and inductance of the secondary transformer at 5 GHz 
are about 3.936 and 1.276 nH, respectively. The 
primary transformer has an inner length of 115-μm, 
metal width of 10-μm, and secondary transformer has 
an inner length of 88-μm, metal width of 10-μm. The 
proposed 3-D stacked transformer used 6 metal layers. 
This work uses the 3D transformer to gain a low Q, so 
as to the ILFD has a larger locking range and reduce 
the chip-size. Therefore, the 3-D stacked transformer 
suitably is applied in ILFD.

mixer MOS M3 is connected between the VCO output 
nodes for coupling an external signal to the resonator. 
Two varactors connected in back-to-back are used for 
frequency tuning and extending the ILFD operational 
locking range. 
   The operation principle of the circuit is as follows. 
When the ILFD operates as a free-running oscillator, 
no injection signal is applied to the ILFD, the 
injection mixer M3 becomes a resonator load. The 
drain output voltage vds of M3 can be written as 
Vdscos(ωot), where ωo is the radian oscillation 
frequency and Vds is the amplitude of oscillation. 
Upon applying an injection signal to the ILFD, the 
transistor M3 is used as a nonlinear mixer. The drain 
current iDS of FET M3 is modulated by the injection
