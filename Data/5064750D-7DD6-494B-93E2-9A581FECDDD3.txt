Abstract 
Equal weights of cuttlebone chitosan and activated clay were well mixed and prepared as the wet (without 
drying) and dried (with freeze-drying) beads. The resulting composite beads were then cross-linked with 
glutaraldehyde as the supports for β-glucosidase immobilization. It was shown that the storage stability of 
immobilized enzyme was higher than that of free enzyme. The activity of immobilized enzyme on dried 
composite was higher those on wet chitosan beads and wet composite after being repeatedly used for 50 
times. The thermal deactivation energies of free and immobilized enzymes were also evaluated. For a given 
enzymatic reaction, the Michaelis constant and maximum rate of reaction using dried-composite 
immobilized enzyme were larger than those using both free and wet-composite immobilized enzymes. 
 
 
Introduction 
 Chitosan is cheap, non-toxic, and not harmful support to the enzymes. It has many advantages such as 
excellent hydrophilicity, high porosity and large adhesion area. Chitosan possesses hydroxyl and amino 
(-NH2) groups, which link with enzymes [1] and, can be cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to prevent 
dissolution in acidic solutions (pH < 2). When chitosan is prepared in the bead form, it can entrap twice as 
much of enzyme, estimated based on the mass transported and the volume of reactive dyes sorbed onto 
internal pores [11]. Cetinus and Oztop [2] found that catalase immobilized on chitosan beads exhibits better 
thermal and pH stabilities than free one, and that there are high activities and long lifetimes when tyrosinase, 
β-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase are immobilized on chitosan beads [3,4]. Although the cross-linked 
chitosan beads have greater mechanical strength and are more applicable in biochemical engineering, there 
are operational defects; for example, the density is similar to that of water (causing it to float easily) and the 
texture is too soft. This limits industrial applications of chitosan. 
 The problems of chitosan beads outlined above may be solved when the bead is prepared by mixing 
with some powders such as clays and activated carbons to increase their densities and mechanical strengths, 
thereby extending application possibilities [5,6]. Lai and Shin [6] have immobilized acid phosphatase on 
montmorillonite and chitosan to improve phosphorus content of soil. In this work, activated clay powders 
were added to chitosan/acetic acid slurry to prepare the composite beads, in either wet (without freeze-drying) 
or dried (with freeze-drying) manner, to improve the properties of chitosan beads. These beads were then 
cross-linked with glutaraldehyde for β-glucosidase immobilization. The optimal immobilization conditions 
(enzyme loading, immobilization time, cross-linking time, amount of glutaraldehye, etc.) and operation 
stability when used repeatedly of immobilized enzymes were studied and compared with corresponding 
properties of free enzyme. Thermal deactivation and catalytic kinetics of such immobilized enzymes were 
finally examined. This is of practical importance for further applications. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Preparation of cross-linked composite beads 
 Chitosan and activated clay were prepared following the methods described earlier [5]. Chitosan flakes 
(1 g) and activated clay (1 g) were dissolved in 1 M of acetic acid (100 mL) and were agitated with a 
disperser (IKA, Ultra-Turrax T25 basic) at 24,000 rpm for 10 min. The yielded viscous solution was placed

Effect of added amount of glutaraldehyde on enzyme activity 
 Fig. 1 shows the activity (U) of immobilized enzyme at different amounts of glutaradehyde and 
different cross-linking durations during the immobilization process. Under the ranges studied, the activities 
of dried- and wet-composite immobilized enzymes are maximized at a glutaraldehyde concentration of 1 and 
4 g/L, respectively. The activity of the former enzyme is 1.1-2.4 times higher than that of the latter one. A 
larger amount of glutaradehyde may cause some enzyme denaturation. Jiang et al. [7] have stated that the 
activity of immobilized laccase reaches its maximum when 8% cross-linked magnetic chitosan microspheres 
are used as carrier. As glutaraldehyde concentration exceeds 8%, extensive interaction of enzymes with 
aldehyde groups on the surface of microspheres changes enzyme conformation and cause the drop of enzyme 
activity.

Fig. 1. Effect of amount of glutaraldehyde and cross-linking time on enzyme immobilization 
 
 The effect of cross-linking duration on enzyme activity is shown in Fig. 1b. During the period of 
30-210 min, the activity of dried-composite immobilized enzyme deteriorates as cross-linking time increases 
but the activity of wet-composite immobilized enzyme reaches a maximum at 120 min. Thus, the 
glutaradehyde concentration and cross-linking time are selected to be 5 g/L and 120 min, respectively. 
Effect of pH and temperature on enzyme activity 
 It is observed from Fig. 2 that the relative activity of free enzyme increases when pH is increased up to 
6.0. As expected, the immobilized enzymes have either the same or a broader pH range with high activity 
than free enzymes. The optimal pH for wet- and dried composite immobilized enzymes is 4.5, and 5.5, 
respectively. The activity of wet- and dried-composite immobilized enzymes is comparable at pH 2.5-4.5, but 
the latter enzyme exhibits higher activity than the former one at pH 5.0-6.0. For instance, the relative activity 
of dried-composite immobilized enzyme is over 91.5% in the pH range 4.5-6.0. It has been actually reported 
that the immobilized α-amylase on wet composite has almost no activity variation (relative activity > 93%) 
in the pH range 5.8-8.0, but free α-amylase deteriorates when pH is increased [5]. 
 Fig. 3 show that the immobilized enzymes have a broader tolerance range to heat than free enzymes. 
The relative activities of free, wet- and dried-composite immobilized enzymes remain over 30.1%, 81.1%, 
and 65.5%, respectively, in the temperature range 25-75°C. Evidently, the optimal temperature of free and 
immobilized enzymes is located between 55 and 65°C. In a series of studies, the relative activities of acid 
phosphatase at 27-87°C, and α-amylase, β-amylase, and glucoamylase at 15-85°C immobilized on wet 
composite were found to remain over 45%, 71%, 63%, and 74%, respectively [5]. The optimal temperature 
was shifted from 60°C for free glucoamylase to 50°C for immobilized enzyme; however, the temperature 
them more rigid and indissoluble. 
pH stability of free and immobilized enzymes 
 The pH stabilities of free and immobilized β-glucosidase are compared by immersing them in a 0.1 M 
of sodium acetate buffer in the pH range 2.5-6 for 1 h at 25oC. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Free enzyme 
has almost no activity variation (relative activity > 98.6%) at pH 3-6. The pH stability of free enzyme is 
higher than those of immobilized enzymes; in addition, the dried composite immobilized enzyme exhibits 
slightly lower pH stability than the wet one, but it still maintains over 76.7% of the original activity at pH 
2.5-6. In examining the residual activities of free and immobilized laccase on magnetic chitosan 
microspheres, Jiang et al. [7] found that immobilized laccase is stable in the pH 5-6 while free laccase is 
stable in the pH range 7-9. This indicates that immobilization appreciably improves the stability of laccase in 
acidic region. 
Thermal deactivation of immobilized enzymes 
 Fig. 6 shows time changes of the activities of free and immobilized enzymes at different temperatures. 
Thermal deactivation of free and immobilized enzymes is described by the pseudo-first-order equation [10]:

where A0 and A are the activities of enzyme at t = 0 and time t, respectively, kd is the first-order rate constant, 
and C1 is a constant. The linear fitting is reasonably acceptable (correlation coefficient, R2 > 0.9151). 
According to these plots, the half-lives for free and immobilized enzymes are evaluated and also compiled in 
Table 3. The half-lives for the wet- and dried-composites immobilized enzymes are much longer than that of 
free enzyme in the range of 50-70oC as also shown in Fig. 7.

the immobilized enzyme has an apparently lower affinity for its substrate than a free enzyme does, which 
may be caused by steric hindrance of the active site by the support, the loss of enzyme flexibility necessary

 Cetinus and Oztop [2] have found that the KM value of immobilized catalase is larger than that of free 
enzyme but the immobilization decreases the Vmax value. This is because in their study the chitosan beads are 
further treated by glutaraldehyde, which reduces enzyme activity and may prohibit substrate diffusion to the 
enzyme. The change in affinity of the enzyme to its substrate is probably caused by structural changes in the 
enzyme due to immobilization procedure or by the lower accessibility of the substrate to the active site of 
immobilized enzymes. The Vmax value of immobilized enzyme is therefore smaller than that of free enzyme. 
 
Conclusions 
 The composite beads prepared by mixing equal weights of activated clay and chitosan, in wet or dried 
manner, and cross-linking with glutaraldehyde were used as the immobilization support for β-glucosidase. 
The activity of β-glucosidase immobilized on dried composite was significantly higher than that on wet 
composite at pH 5-6, and the activities for both immobilized enzymes were the same at 45-75oC. The activity 
of β-glucosidase immobilized on dried composite was 1.8 times higher than that on pure chitosan after 
50-times reuse. Thermal deactivation analysis showed that the deactivation energies for immobilized enzyme 
on wet (111.4 kJ/mol) and dried composites (143.7 kJ/mol) were smaller than that of free enzyme (190.7 
kJ/mol), indicating that immobilized β-glucosidase was more temperature insensitive. The half-life of 
immobilized β-glucosidase was 3~10 times longer than that of free enzyme at 50-70oC. The maximum rate 
of the given catalytic reaction (Vmax) using dried-composite immobilized enzyme were 8.2 and 1.2 times 
larger than those for wet immobilized and free enzymes, respectively. The present work demonstrated a 
promising application potential of such chitosan-clay composite beads for enzyme immobilization.
