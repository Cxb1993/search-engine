Abstract 
The oxidation resistance of metal alloy coatings becomes a critical issue on the high 
temperature application, such as a protective hard coating on glass molding die. The current 
project evaluates the performance of sputtered Cr–Ta or Ta–Zr coatings. The amorphous or 
nanocrystalline Cr–Ta coatings were deposited at 550 °C, which revealed single phase for the 
Ta-rich coatings and two phases for the Cr-rich coatings. The Ta–Zr coatings deposited at 400 °C 
possessed an amorphous states for the Ta-rich coatings or a crystalline β–Zr and an amorphous 
phase for the Zr-rich ones. The annealing treatments were conducted at 600 oC under various 
oxygen containing atmospheres. After annealing treatment, the variations in crystalline structure, 
hardness, surface roughness and chemical composition profiles in depth were investigated.

1. Introduction  
Protective coatings to be used under severe environmental conditions, such as elevated 
temperatures, high working stress and controlled atmosphere, are of high interest in versatile 
industrial applications. To extend lifetime and enhance the properties of the molding dies for 
glass molding, functional protective coatings have been applied on the core material with cost 
effectiveness during mass-production. During the molding process, the molding dies need to 
endure a thermal cycle of the temperature range from room temperature to around 600 °C. In our 
previous studies, concrete solutions were proposed by utilizing refractory metal alloy coatings, 
Mo–Ru [1] and Ta–Ru [2], to replace the use of precious metal alloy films, such as Pt–Ir [3] and 
Ir–Re [4] coatings, as the protective coatings for glass molding dies. Both Mo–Ru and Ta–Ru 
coatings, after annealing at 600 °C under a high vacuum, showed nanohardness, roughness and 
phase stability comparable to those of as-deposited ones [5,2]. However, in a typical molding 
atmosphere (~12 ppm oxygen and balanced nitrogen), the formation and volatility of MoO3 
 3 
characteristics after heat treating, Ta–Zr coatings were further annealed at 600 °C for 30 min in 
50 ppm O2-N2 or 1% O2-Ar atmospheres, respectively.  
A conventional X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X’Pert PRO MPD, PANalytical, Netherlands) 
with Cu Kα radiation was adopted to identify the phases. The surface hardness values were 
measured with a nanoindentation tester (TriboScope, Hysitron, USA) for Cr-Ta coatings or a 
nanoindentation tester (Nano Hardness Tester, CSM, Switzerland) for Ta-Zr coatings. The surface 
roughness values, Ra and Rq, of the coatings were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, 
Dimension 3100 SPM, NanoScope IIIa, Veeco, USA). The surface morphologies of the coatings 
were evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S4800, Hitachi, Japan). 
The chemical compositions were evaluated with the field-emission electron probe microanalyzer 
(FE-EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL, Japan). The nanostructure was examined by transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010F, JEOL, Japan). The chemical states of the constitute 
elements were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 1600, PHI, Japan). The 
chemical composition depth profiles were evaluated by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES, 
PHI700, ULVAC-PHI, Japan).

Table 1 lists the chemical compositions of the Cr–Ta coatings prepared with various input 
powers and a total power of 730W. As the input power of Cr target increased from 265 to 465 W, 
the atomic ratio of Cr/(Cr+Ta) linearly increased from 0.37 to 0.71.

Fig.1a shows the XRD spectra of as-deposited Cr–Ta coatings. We identified the primary 
wide reflection at the two theta angles around 40 degrees to an amorphous or a nanocrysyalline 
structure. Moreover, a second nanocrysyalline reflection at the two theta angles around 43.8 
degrees was identified for the Cr-rich coatings. From the FWHM analysis on the primary 
reflection by the Scherrer's formula [14], the apparent grain sizes were calculated to be 1.8, 1.9 
and 1.9 nm for the as-deposited Cr0.37Ta0.63, Cr0.44Ta0.56 and Cr0.53Ta0.47 coatings, respectively. 
Regenbrecht et al. defined a grain size criterion of 2.5 nm calculated from the half-width value of 
a reflection for the upper limit of amorphous state [15]. Besides the wide amorphous reflection,

3.1.2 Cr–Ta coatings annealed in a 12 ppm O2-N2 atmosphere 
The atomic ratios of Cr/(Cr+Ta) sustained original levels for each coating after annealing as 
listed in Table 1. The volatility of Cr2O3 and Ta2O5 will not occur at 600 oC. After annealing, the 
O/(Cr+Ta) ratio increases from 0.11 to 0.62 as the Ta/(Cr+Ta) ratio increases from 0.28 to 0.62.  
Though oxygen was introduced into all the Cr–Ta coatings during annealing, the XRD 
spectra revealed similar reflections comparable to those of the as-deposited ones, besides for the 
tiny Cr2O3 and Ta2O5 reflections, as Fig.1b shows. From the FWHM analysis of the reflection at 
2θ~40o, the apparent grain size was 1.7 nm for the annealed Cr0.53Ta0.47 coating. While the 
annealed Cr0.71Ta0.29 coating consisted of bimodal grain distribution, 1.9 and 5.5 nm related to 
amorphous Cr2Ta and nanocrystalline Cr phase, respectively, which were comparable to the 
as-deposited ones. Since the formation Gibbs free energies of Cr2O3 and Ta2O5 at 600 °C are 
−605,585 and −663,572 J/(mole of O2) [20], respectively, Ta2O5 should form preferentially. 
However, Ta2O5 reflections were not but Cr2O3 (104) and (116) reflections were present in the 
XRD spectra of the annealed Cr0.62Ta0.38 and Cr0.71Ta0.29 coatings.  
Fig.3 shows the AES depth profiles of the 600 oC annealed Cr0.71Ta0.29 coatings. Three zones 
were defined from the inner part outwardly. The atomic ratio of Cr/(Cr+Ta) sustained at 
0.69±0.01 in the unoxidized region, zone III. The appearance of zone II, a Cr-depleted region, 
implied that Cr outwardly diffused and reacted with oxygen on the free surface to form the Cr 
and O dominative oxide scale, zone I. Habazaki et al. reported the oxidation behavior of 
sputter-deposited Cr–Ta alloys at 1073–1273 K [21]. An outer protective Cr2O3 layer, responsible

Fig.7a shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Ta–Zr coatings. A broad refection at 2θ~38o, 
implying a near amorphous state, was revealed for the as-deposited Ta67Zr33 and Ta76Zr24 coatings. 
In the work of Hecht et al. [22], the cocondensed Zr–Ta films prepared by electron-beam 
evaporation at room temperature with Zr content of 20–70 at.% showed amorphous. In this study, 
grain sizes of the as-deposited Ta67Zr33 and Ta76Zr24 coatings were calculated to be 1.8 and 2.4 
nm, respectively. For the Ta55Zr45 coating, the second broad reflection around 2θ~64o exhibited 
comparable intensity related to the primary reflection at 2θ~38o. The Ta33Zr67 and Ta49Zr51 
coatings, Zr-rich coatings, showed a strong bcc β-Zr (110) texture at 2θ~36o overlapped with the

Ta–Zr coatings were annealed in a 1% O2-Ar atmosphere, all the oxygen contents increased to 
higher levels than those of coatings annealed in 50 ppm O2–N2.. All the Ta–Zr coatings annealed 
in 1% O2-Ar formed crystallized ZrO2 except for the Ta76Zr24 coating. The Ta76Zr24 coating 
absorbed 44.5 and 50.7 at.% O after annealing in 50 ppm O2–N2 and 1% O2-Ar, respectively, but 
sustained the near amorphous structure. 
The Gibbs free energies of metal oxide formation of ZrO2 and Ta2O5 at 600oC are -931,249 
and -663,572 Joules per mole of oxygen molecules [20], respectively, ZrO2 forms preferentially. 
From the analysis of XPS profiles for the 1% O2–Ar annealed Ta49Zr51 coating, 183.40 eV for 
Zr4+ 3d5/2 and 27.42 for Ta5+ 4f7/2 were examined on the surface. In the interior part, with 
presence of oxygen, the Zr4+ 3d5/2 sustained at 183.44±0.02 eV but the Ta profiles were split to a 
mixture of Ta0(22.56±0.02 eV), Ta2+(24.30±0.03 eV) and Ta5+(27.50±0.08 eV) for 4f7/2 peaks, 
where the intensity of Ta0 exceeded 50%. The Zr4+ 3d5/2 of 183.40–183.46 eV was comparable to 
reported values of 183.3 eV [24]. 
The hardness values of annealed Ta–Zr coatings increased due to the formation of ZrO2. The 
50 ppm O2–N2 annealed Ta–Zr coatings revealed hardness values of 6 and 14 GPa with 9.0 and 
64.7 at.% O, respectively. A 1% O2–Ar annealed Ta49Zr51 coating with 28.6 at.% O showed 11 
GPa in hardness. All the Ta–Zr coating surfaces sustained surface roughness in nano-scale after 
annealing 
 
4. Conclusions 
Through X-ray diffraction technique, an amorphous or a nanocrystalline structure was 
observed for the as-deposited Cr–Ta coatings. After annealing at 600 oC for 4 h in a glass 
molding atmosphere, 12 ppm O2-N2, a protective Cr2O3 film formed on the surface of Cr–rich 
Cr–Ta coatings due to the outward diffusion of Cr, which resulted into the progress of surface 
hardness to 12-16 GPa and the in-diffusion of oxygen is restricted. An increase in alloy tantalum 
content resulted in the increase in the oxidation rate. The AFM survey indicated that the surface 
morphology of annealed Cr-rich Cr–Ta coatings exhibited a nano scale surface profile. The 
Cr-rich Cr-Ta coatings with the Ti interlayer achieved satisfactory thermal stability with respect 
to phase evolution and surface characteristics including roughness and hardness. 
The Ta-rich Ta–Zr coatings revealed an amorphous structure, while the Zr-rich ones present 
a mixture of a crystalline β-Zr phase and an amorphous phase. The as-deposited coatings 
possessed a hardness of 4–5 GPa. As annealed in an oxygen containing atmosphere, Zr oxidized 
preferentially. After annealing in 50 ppm O2-N2, the amorphous Ta67Zr33 coating transformed into 
crystalline tetragonal ZrO2 phase, accompanied with a high hardness of 14 GPa due to the high 
oxygen dissolution solubility. Contrary, the crystallized Zr-rich coatings formed a thin protective 
oxide scale but restricted the hardening. All the annealed coatings sustained a nanoscale surface 
roughness. We propose an appropriate pre-treatment, such as annealed in a 50 ppm O2-N2 
atmosphere, make the Ta-rich Ta–Zr coatings achieve satisfactory mechanical characteristics 
including roughness and hardness, becoming an appropriate protective coating for the die 
material.
