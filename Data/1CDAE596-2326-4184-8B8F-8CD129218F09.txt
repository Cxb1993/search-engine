operation, such as easy to lose, difficult to filter. . .etc. . .
Additionally, some other application of Fe–Ni nanoparticles
deposited on Al2O3 have been researched and published by us
[27,28].
2. Experimental
2.1. Deposition of Fe–Ni nanoparticles on Al2O3
microparticles
Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) particles of micrometer size are
used as carrier on which Fe–Ni nanoparticles are deposited. The
Al2O3 microparticles were first cleaned in acetone solution by
ultrasonic vibration, then sensitized in SnCl2 + HCl solution
and activated in of PdCl2 + HCl solution, last deposited with
Fe–Ni nanoparticles in plating bath.
The deposition parameters and composition of electroless
Fe–Ni plating bath are listed in Table 1.
The total quantity of Fe2+ and Ni2+ in plating bath is kept at
0.076 mol and the Fe2+/Ni2+ molar ratio is changed from 0.33 to
2.5 in respective plating process. When Fe2+/Ni2+ molar ratio is
3.0, the plating bath would degenerate due to the oxidation of
Fe2+ and the sedimentation of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, the plating
bath is covered by a film of xylene to separate solution from air
and the Fe2+/Ni2+ molar ratio can be increased to 10.0 before
degeneration of the plating bath occurs.
The weight of Al2O3 particles added in plating bath is 1 g/
100 ml of plating solution.
A JEOL-2010EX transmission electron microscope (TEM)
operating at 200 kV and a JEOL JSM-6700F field emission
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) were used for EM
examination. The chemical composition of the deposited Fe–Ni
particles was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectro-
scopy (EDS) equipped with a microscope and a single crystal
X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Surface areas of both Al2O3
particles and Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles were measured by nitrogen
adsorption method (BET area). The Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles after
acid digestion/filtration were analyzed by a GBC inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) to
get the respective weight percent of Fe, Ni in Fe–Ni
nanoparticles.
2.2. Dechlorination of chloroform and trichloroethylene
The decomposition of chloroform and trichloroethylene by
Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles was investigated by batch experiments.
In the chloroform (CF) batch test, 20 ml of aqueous solution
with 2 mg/L CF and 5 g/L of Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles was put in a
20-ml serum bottle capped with a Teflon Mininert valve. The
aqueous solutions were mixed on a rotary shaker (with 60 and
130 rpm, respectively) at ambient temperature (30  1 8C) for
various times and the variation of CF concentration with time
was analyzed by a Hewlett–Packard model 6890 GC equipped
with an micron electron capture detector (mECD). In the
trichloroethylene (TCE) batch test, 20 ml of aqueous solution
with 2 mg/L TCE and 5 g/L Fe–Ni/ Al2O3 particles was put in a
20-ml serum bottle capped with a Teflon Mininert valve. The
aqueous solutions were mixed on a rotary shaker (with 60 rpm)
at ambient temperature (30  1 8C) for various times and the
variation of TCE concentration with time was analyzed by a HP
6890 GC–mECD. Parallel experiments without Fe–Ni particles
in the aqueous solutions were also performed as laboratory
blanks. The CF and TCE concentration were analyzed on the
headspace gas by using HP 6890C GC–mECD and
30 m  0.32 mm  0.25 mm HP-5 column with 2.5 ml min1
nitrogen flow rate after equilibrating over 1 h. For the head-
space sampling, 50 ml headspace gas sample was introduced by
splitless injection into to GC–ECD at a 200 8C injector
temperature, the program was 50 8C for 1 min, followed by a
ramp at 25 8C/min and finally kept at 150 8C for 3 min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles
The Al2O3 particles as carriers have irregular shape with size
in the range of 0.1–5 mm, shown in the FESEM image of Fig. 1,
and have a-phase crystal structure, determined by XRD with
nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation (=0.15416 nm). The TEM
image of Al2O3 particles after electroless Fe–Ni plating in bath
with Fe2+/Ni2+ molar molar ratio of 1.0 for 30 min are shown in
Fig. 2(a) and (b), the latter is the magnification of the former.
On the surface of the Al2O3 particles there are many about
40 nm size of Fe–Ni particles with composition of 90 at.% Ni
and 10 at.% Fe, which were determined by TEM/EDS. The
phases in Fe–Ni nanoparticle contain Fe, Ni, FeNi and FeNi3,

clear that the iron content in the Fe–Ni particle is increased by
increasing the Fe2+/Ni2+ molar ratio in the plating bath with a
covered film of xylene and can reach to 60 at.%, but the iron
content in the Fe–Ni nanoparticles is around 10 at.% and
almost independent of the Fe2+/Ni2+ molar ratio in the plating
bath without a covered film of xylene.
3.2. Dechlorination of chloroform and trichloroethylene
Fig. 6 shows the variation of C/C0 ratio, C and C0 are the
concentration (mg/L) of chloroform at a given time and initial
time, respectively, with the reaction time in the aqueous
solution containing 2 mg/L CF initially and 5 g/L of Fe–Ni/
Al2O3 particles with 9 at.% of Fe. The chloroform can be
decomposed to half concentration in 0.7 h by Fe–Ni/Al2O3.
From the linear regression, the reaction mechanism of
dechlorination of chloroform by Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles appears
to be pseudo first order. The half life of 0.7 h is rather short.
Additionally, the trichloroethylene with initial concentration
of 2 mg/L was dechlorinated by Fe–Ni/ Al2O3 particles with
concentration of 5 g/L, the latter contains 9 at.% of Fe and has
been kept in atmosphere dryer for 1 year. The result shows that
the trichloroethylene can be reduced 50.0% in 0.25 h and
62.2% in 0.5 h. This also manifests the Fe–Ni/Al2O3 particles
of this research is rather effective reducing substance for
dechlorination of Trichloroethylene even it having been
exposed to dry air for 1 year.
Liu et al. [21] had demonstrated that almost complete
dechlorination of chlorophenols by Pd/Fe was achieved within
5 h. The study of Kim et al. [25] showed that the half life of
dechlorination of pentachlorophenol by zero valence iron was
approximately 7.4 days and the dechlorination rate by Pd/Fe,
Pt/Fe, Ni/Fe and Cu/Fe were much slower (estimated half lives
of 36–43 days). In an investigation [29] complete dechlorina-
tion of 5.0 ml of 2.48 mM pentachlorophenol was observed for
1.0 g of 2659 ppm Pd/Mg (20 mesh) after 48 h.
