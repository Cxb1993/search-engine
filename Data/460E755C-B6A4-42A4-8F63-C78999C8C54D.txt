Abstract 
  
An Al-15 wt% Zn alloy was processed by friction stir processing (FSP) to produce 
grain sizes of ~0.5um, ~1 um and ~2 um. A simple and effective method is developed 
to determine the true strain by scribing marker lines with scaled division using 
focused ion beam (FIB) micromachining prior to deformation. The “microscopic” 
grain boundary sliding with displacements of adjacent grains of the order of a 
nanometer can easily be detected by the technique, providing a surface analysis with a 
high accuracy that allowed us to observe the changes in relief with increasing strains. 
Moreover, the occurrence of GBS at room temperature was considered to be a major 
reason for an higher strain rate sensitivity (SRS) in fine-grained Al-Zn alloys.  
 
Keywords: Friction stir processing (FSP); Focused ion beam (FIB); Grain boundary

also stabilize the fine structure at elevated temperatures. In this work, the Al-TM 
systems studied include Al-Fe and Al-Mo, in which the major reinforcing phases 
formed are Al13Fe4 and Al12Mo, respectively. The Al-MO systems studied include 
Al-Fe2O3, Al-SiO2 and Al-CeO2. In the Al-MO systems, the major reinforcing phase is 
the nanometer sized Al2O3 particles produced by the FSP. In addition, the metal (M) in 
MO reduced by Al would further react with Al to form intermetallic compounds, such 
as Al13Fe4 and Al11Ce3. The important results of this study will be summarized in the 
following. 
(1) Al-Fe 
In this study, billet of a binary Al-10 at% Fe alloy was prepared from pure Al and Fe 
powders by the use of conventional press and sinter route. The sintered billet was then 
subjected to multiple passages of friction stir processing (FSP). A rapid in-situ 
reaction between Al and Fe had occurred in FSP, and Al-Fe second phase particles 
were formed. The Al-Fe intermetallic particles (Al13Fe4) with mean size ~100 nm 
were distributed uniformly in the aluminum matrix, which had ultrafine-grained 
structure (~1 m). The composites produced are fully dense with high modulus (91 
GPa) and high tensile strength (217 MPa). The effect of FSP processing parameters 
was also investigated in this work. It was found that a low traveling speed (45 
mm/min) could produce larger amount of Al13Fe4 particles and higher strength, which 
might be attributed to longer reaction time and higher temperature associated with low 
traveling speed. 
(2) Al-Mo 
Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to produce fine dispersion of Al-Mo 
intermetallic particles in aluminum. In this process, the hot working nature of FSP 
could effectively promote the exothermic reaction between Al and Mo and produce 
fine Al-Mo intermetallic dispersoid with an average size of ~200 nm. The Al-Mo 
intermetallic particles formed during FSP were identified mainly as Al12Mo with 
minor amount of Al5Mo. From the study of post-FSP heat treatment at 873 K, one 
could find that the Al5Mo phase was formed between Mo and Al12Mo. The Al-Mo 
reaction in heat treatment without the help of concurrent shear deformation was rather 
slow, because it is controlled by the interdiffusion through Al12Mo phase. It is 
suggested that the critical mechanism responsible for the rapid reaction and the 
formation of nanometer sized particles in FSP is the effective removal of the Al12Mo 
phase from the Al-Mo interface by the severe strain imposed in FSP. 
(3) Al-Fe2O3 and Al-SiO2 
Aluminum matrix composites reinforced with nanometer sized Al2O3 particles were 
produced by the use of friction stir processing (FSP). In the composites, Al2O3 
particles were produced in situ by oxide-aluminum displacement reaction. This 
approach has combined hot working nature of FSP and exothermic reaction between 
Al and oxide. To investigate the effect of heat release in the displacement reaction, 
both Al-SiO2 and Al-Fe2O3 powder mixtures were used as starting materials in this 
work. Billet of Al-oxide powder mixture was prepared from by the use of 
conventional press and sinter route. The sintered billet was then subjected to multiple 
passages of friction stir processing (FSP). A rapid in-situ reaction between Al and 
Fe2O3 had occurred in FSP. After 4 FSP passes, Fe2O3 had reacted completely with Al 
in Al-2Fe2O3, the major second phases produced by FSP are γ-Al2O3 and Al13Fe4. 
The microstructure of Al-Fe2O3 after FSP can be characterized as nanometer sized 
particles uniformly distributed in the aluminum matrix, which had ultrafine-grained 
structure (~1 m). In general, there are two types of particles in morphology: (1) 
particles of ~200 nm in size and mostly with elliptical shape were identified as 
VIII 
 
  The starting materials used were commercially pure Al powders (99.7% purity, 325 
mesh) and Zn powders (99.5% purity, 325 mesh). The premixed alloy powders, with 
Zn content of 15 wt%, were cold compacted into 12×20×80 mm billets in a steel die 
set, under a pressure of 225 MPa. First, large pin (the diameters of the shoulder and 
probe of the tool were 16 and 6 mm, respectively) and high spindle rotation speed 
(1500 rpm) were employed to produce dense large cross section bulk material. Then, 
the smaller diameters of the shoulder and probe of the tool and lower spindle rotation 
speed were used to produce refined grain size (~500 nm ~ 1m and ~2 m) [9]. 
Importantly, the processed samples and fixture have to be cooled down to room 
temperature when one processing operation parameter is changed to another in order 
to avoid accumulative heating during pass of FSP. The tilt angle was maintained 
at approximately 3o. The detailed description of the FSP set-up can be found in some 
published papers [9,14]. As shown in Fig. 1, the oxygen content of starting powders 
and FSPed Al-15Zn samples (Al-15Zn-1, Al-15Zn-2 and Al-15Zn-3) was determined 
using an oxygen-nitrogen analyzer (HORIBA, EMGA-620W). It was also observed 
that the oxygen contents of all the Al-15Zn samples and starting powder were 
negligible small. The tensile specimen was machined from the FSP billet with the 
tensile axis parallel to the FSP traveling direction. Multiple dog-bone shaped tensile 
specimens with a 6 mm gauge length, a 1.5 mm width, and 1.5 mm thickness were 
electro-discharge machined from the stir zone. The dog-bone samples were first 
surface polished to a mirror finish using silicon oxide of 20 nm particles, and then the 
surfaces were polished by Argon ions (Gatan Mode 683 Met-Etch Ion-Polisher) to 
remove the surface defects, such as scratches, embedded polishing grit, and oxide 
layers. Then, the marker line and crossing line were scribed using FIB (Fig. 2). The 
width and depth of the scribed fine line were 50 nm and 60 nm, respectively, much 
finer than the mechanical scratches [15-17] and the distance between two crossing 
lines was 25 m as a reference . Measuring the true local strains and the offsets of 
marker lines on the surfaces of deformed specimen are crucial to estimate the 
contribution of GBS. Based on the definition of strain, the true local strains at 
different locations of specimen after deformation were obtained by taking the distance 
between the selected crossing lines along the appropriate direction. With the 
assumption that the deformation along the thickness direction is the same as along 
transverse direction. In each case six 6×6 m area s at least were analyzed and 
determination of the GBS component perpendicular to the specimen surface (the u 
component in Fig. 3) was made on these areas. For the observation of grain size, the 
grain boundary was etched by GATAN Model 683 Met-Etch Ion-Polisher and then 
examined by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6330TF). A computer program 
(Optimas-6.1) was used to determine the grain size and size distribution. The tensile 
tests were conducted using an Instron 5582 universal testing machine with initial 
strain rates of 1×10-3 s-1 at room temperature. For each specimen, more than 500 
grains were measured. XRD was performed with a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer 
operating with CuK radiation (=0.15406 nm). Samples were scanned between 20

3. Results and discussion 
The plots of XRD patterns of the FSPed ufg Al-15Zn and Al + Zn powder samples 
are shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly shown that peaks in the pattern of the FSPed Al-15Zn 
sample are related to aluminum single FCC phase. Such a result also indicates that all 
of the Zn added into the green sample has been dissolved into aluminum matrix after 
FSP. The inset of Fig. 4 show the (420) peaks of Al peaks in the patterns of the ufg

position where true strains were measured for the Al-15Zn-1, Al-15Zn-2 and 
Al-15Zn-3 pulled at a strain rate of 1x10-3 s-1. Typical offsets of marker lines of the 
local regions marked by the white rectangles on the deformed specimen in Al-15Zn-1 
and their true strains of 5%, 13%, 21%, 40%, and 60%, respectively are shown in Fig 
9(a)(b)(c)(d)(e). The grains were remained equiaxed in shape during deformation. A 
closer inspection revealed that the marker lines were sharply defined and exhibited 
apparent sliding offsets at many grain boundaries. The sliding offsets tended to 
increase with the elongation. Focused on the region of small strains (5% and 13%), 
the occurrence of numerous small offsets, which took place when tiny marker lines 
were used, would not obscure the general trend in grain displacement. These results 
indicate that the method is capable of differentiating relatively small displacements 
and providing a quantitative measurement of the total sliding displacement. In the past, 
conventional methods [2-3] would be more difficult to analyze sliding displacement at 
lower strains or non-uniform regimes on such fine grained materials. Similar 
measurement for Al-15Zn-2 and Al-15Zn-3 from Fig 10 and Fig 11 are summaried in 
Table 1. The strain caused by GBS, gbs as characterized by Eq. 2 can be 
determined by measuring the sliding offset (u) combined with measurements of the 
mean linear intercept grain size (L) [23].

where is the average value of u, is the mean linear intercept grain size, and is 
a geometrical constant, which is taken as 0.8 [29]. Finally, the GBS 
contribution,is determined in Eq. 3 [30]: 
   ,

where is the total strain of the specimen. The above data for deformed specimens 
are summaried in Table 1.  
Figure 12(a) shows the measured GBS contribution to the true strain at different 
strains regions. The GBS contribution increased from ~4% for Al-15Zn-3 to ~18% for 
Al-15Zn-1. During the initial deformation stage, the GBS contribution increased with 
increasing strain and reach a saturation value when strain is higher than 20%. The 
saturation of GBS contribution at higher strain is consistent with the previous report 
[30-32]. Furthermore, while the GBS contribution is plotted as a function d-1/2, where 
d is the average grain size as shown in Fig. 12(b), it is apparent that the GBS 
contribution increases to a greater extent as grain size decreases, which is consistent 
with our present result of m-value. It is interesting to note that the values of strain rate 
sensitivity and GBS contribution are within the range of similar order of magnitude 
regardless of grain sizes. 
The Al-15Zn, as demonstrated in the present study, have some unique features 
different from the typical superplastic metallic alloys. They are follows: (1) the 
increase in the m-value with decrease in grain size and (2) the occurrence of grain 
boundary sliding after deformation. In the following, the mechansim of flow for 
current Al-15Zn will be explored through the comparision of the experimental data 
with those anticipated from available deformation-mechanism models.  
Several deformation mechanisms have been proposed to describe GBS. Among 
the currently available theoretical models based on GBS accommodated by diffusion 
[33] and slip [34-36], the model proposed by Ashby and Verrall (called A-V model) is 
in best agreement with the experimental results of Al-Zn alloy. Ashby and Verrall [33]

but also for determination of the small contribution of GBS in conventional grains. 
Therefore, we also conclude that GBS is a viable deformation process in 
ultrafine-grained and conventional grained Al-Zn materials processed by FSP.
