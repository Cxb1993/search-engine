中文摘要 
在平行計算或通訊上連結網路都扮演著重要的角色。通常我們都用一個無向圖型來表示
網路結構，此圖型中的節點表示網路中的處理器，圖型中的連線表示處理器之間的連接
網路線。在評估網路結構的優缺點時，漢彌爾頓性質和連通度這二個參數，是非常重要
的評估要項。現在我們設圖型，  u 和v 分別是 G 中的兩個節點。節點 u 和v 的
k
*
-container，我們定義成 k 條內部節點無交集的路徑的集合，其中的節點的聯集就等
於 V(G)。對任意相異二節點 u 、v 和任意介於 1 和 k 的整數 w，都存在一個介於節
點 u 和 v 的 k*-container，那我們就稱這個圖型 G 為-連通。同樣的，一個有二部份
節點集合和的雙邊圖 G，我們稱 G 是 k*-可蕾絲的條件是：對任意中的節點 u 和中的
節點  v，和任意介於  1 和  k 的整數  w ，都存在一個介於節點  u 和  v 的 
k
*
-container。k*-連通和 k*-可蕾絲這二個概念是由本計畫的主持人及其共同作著所提
出。很明顯的，圖型 G 中介於 u 和 v 的 k*-container 就是 G 中的漢彌爾頓路徑，
而 k*-container 就是漢彌爾頓迴圈。因此，我們可以把 k*-連通和 k*-可蕾絲看成是漢彌
爾頓性質和連通度的綜合觀念。也就是這樣，k*-連通和 k*-可蕾絲的重要性可想而知。
在本計畫中，我們將分成六大主題來討論：(1) 連結網路中生成連通度和生成蕾絲度性
質的研究；(2) 任意圖型中生成連通度和生成蕾絲度性質的研究；(3) 有些節點或連線
已損毀後的連結網路中生成連通度和生成蕾絲度性質的研究；(4) 容錯漢彌爾頓圖和生
成連通度的關係；(5) 連結網路中生成直徑的研究及(6) 連結網路中生成扇形度的研究。

一、 前言、研究目的、文獻探討 
Interconnection networks play an important role in parallel computing/communication 
systems. Usually, a network is represented as a loopless undirected graph with the vertices 
corresponding the the processors and the edges corresponding the the links between 
processors. The hamiltonian property and connectivity are two major issues for evaluating 
interconnection networks. 
 
 is a graph if  is a finite set and  is a subset of  is an 
unordered pair of . We say that  is the vertex set and  is the edge set. A graph 
 is bipartite if  is the union of two disjoint sets  and  such 
that every edge joins  to . Two vertices u and v are adjacent if . A path is a 
sequence of adjacent vertices, written as , in which all the vertices 
 are distinct except that possibly . We also write the path , 
where . The length of a path , denoted by , is the number of 
edges in . Let u and v be two vertices of G.  The distance between u and v denoted by 
 is the length of the shortest path of G joining u and v. A cycle is a path with at least 
three vertices such that the first vertex is the same as the last one. A hamiltonian cycle is a 
cycle of length . A hamiltonian path is a path of length . 
 
Assume that G is a k-connected graph. It follows from Menger's Theorem that there are k 
internally vertex-disjoint (abbreviated as disjoint) paths joining any two distinct vertices u 
and v. A k-container C(u,v) of G is a set of k disjoint paths joining u to v. In this project, we 
discuss another type of container, called spanning container. A spanning k-container, 
(abbreviated as  -container), C(u,v) is a k-container such that it contains all vertices of G. 
A graph G is -connected if there exists a -container between any two distinct vertices. 
In particular, a graph G is -connected if and only if it is hamiltonian connected, and a 
graph G is -connected if and only if it is hamiltonian. All -connected graphs except that 
 and  are -connected. Thus, we defined the spanning connectivity of a graph G, 
, to be the largest integer k such that G is -connected for all  if G is a 
-connected graph. Obviously, spanning connectivity is a hybrid concept of hamiltonicity 
and connectivity. A graph G is super spanning connected if . Obviously, the 
complete graph  is super spanning connected if . 
 
A graph G is bipartite if its vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets  and  such 
that every edge joins vertices between  and . Let G be a k-connected bipartite graph 
 6 
interconnection networks. We can also study the spanning connectivity of of a faulty 
graph. For example, the following theorem is proved by Lin, Huang, and me [9]. 
 
(2-2) the relationship between the spanning connectivity and fault-tolerant 
hamil-tonian graphs. A graph G is k-fault-tolerant hamiltonian graph if  is 
hamiltonian for any  and . From our observation, super k-spanning 
connected graphs is closely related to -fault tolerant hamiltonian graphs. Several 
questions can be asked. First, we are wondering whether every super k-spanning connected 
graph is -fault-tolerant hamiltonian because all examples we have indicate that the 
statement is true. Moreover, Lin, Huang, and me [9] proved that the Harary graph  is 
super spanning connected. However, we have difficult in proving every  is super 
fault-tolerant hamiltonian. Another interesting question is the existence of any graph that is 
-connected but not -connected for some . Up to now, we have 
several results [5,13]. We will continue our work on this direction. 
 
(3-1) the spanning diameter of some interconnection networks. Let u and v be two 
distinct vertices in G, and let . Let  denote the set of all  
internally-disjoint paths between u and v. Each element  of  consists of  
internally-disjoint paths, and the longest length among these  paths is denoted by . 
The element of  is called a container. The number of elements in  is 
denoted by . We define  as the minimum over all , i.e., 
. We write  as , which means the 
shortest distance between u and v.  is called the -diameter of G and is given by 
. By Menger Theorem,  if . We 
usually write  as  and call  simply the diameter of G. In particular, the  
wide diameter of G is defined as . The wide diameter, proposed by Professor Frank 
Hsu, measures the performance of multipath communication. 
 
(3-2) the spanning fan connectivity. There are other form for spanning problems. For 
example, let G be a graph. Let u be a node of G and  be a subset of 
 not including u. An -fan is a set of disjoint paths  of G such 
that  joins u and . It is proved by Dirac that a graph G is k-connected if and only if 
there exists an -fan between any node u and any k-subset of  such that . 
With this observation, we define a spanning fan is a fan that spans G. Naturally, we can 
study  as the largest integer k such that there exists a spanning -fan between 
any node u and any k-node subset  with . Such concept is used in our recent paper 
[10]. Thus, we can work on  or other variations.

Abstract A k-container C(u,v) of a graph G is a set of k disjoint paths between u
and v. A k-container C(u,v) of G is a k∗-container if it contains all vertices of G.
A graph G is k∗-connected if there exists a k∗-container between any two distinct
vertices of G. Therefore, a graph is 1∗-connected (respectively, 2∗-connected) if and
only if it is Hamiltonian connected (respectively, Hamiltonian). A graph G is super
spanning connected if there exists a k∗-container between any two distinct vertices
of G for every k with 1 ≤ k ≤ κ(G) where κ(G) is the connectivity of G. A bipartite
graph G is k∗-laceable if there exists a k∗-container between any two vertices from
different partite set of G. A bipartite graph G is super spanning laceable if there
exists a k∗-container between any two vertices from different partite set of G for
every k with 1 ≤ k ≤ κ(G). In this paper, we prove that the enhanced hypercube
Qn,m is super spanning laceable if m is an odd integer and super spanning connected
if otherwise.

v from a partite set, say V0, there is a Hamiltonian path of G − {v} joining any two
vertices in the other partite set V1. If G is a 1∗-laceable graph, we define the spanning
laceablility of a bipartite graph G, κ∗(G), to be the largest integer k such that G
is w∗-laceable for all 1 ≤ w ≤ k. A bipartite graph G is super spanning laceable
if κ∗(G) = κ(G). Recently, Chang et al. [4] proved that the hypercube graph Qn
is super spanning laceable. All bipartite hypercube-like graphs are super spanning
laceable [14]. The n-dimensional star graph Sn is super spanning laceable if and only
if n = 3 [12].
Graph containers do exist in engineering designed information and telecommuni-
cation networks or in biological and neural systems ([1, 9] and their references). The
study of w-container and their w∗-container plays a pivotal role in the design and the
implementation of parallel routing and efficient information transmission in a large
scale networking systems. In biological informatics and neural informatics, the exis-
tence of a w∗-container signifies the effects on the signal transduction system and the
reactions in metabolic pathways.
Among all interconnection networks proposed in the literature, the hypercubes Qn
is one of the most popular topologies [10]. Let u = u1u2 · · ·un−1un be an n-bit binary
strings. The hamming weight of u, denoted by w(u), is defined to be the number of
i such that ui = 1. The n-dimensional hypercube Qn consists of all n-bit binary
strings as its vertices and two vertices u = u1u2 · · ·un−1un and v = v1v2 · · ·vn−1vn
are adjacent if and only if u and v differ by exactly one bit, i.e., ∑ni=1 |ui − vi | = 1.
Obviously, Qn is a bipartite graph with bipartition W = {u | w(u) is even} and B =
{u | w(u) is odd}. For convenience, the vertices in W are referred as even vertices
and the vertices in B are referred as odd vertices.
Some variations of hypercubes structures have been reported in the literature, for
instance, the folded hypercubes FQn by El-Amawy and Latifi [6] and enhanced
hypercubes Qn,m (2 ≤ m ≤ n) by Tzeng NF and Wei S [19]. The folded hyper-
cubes FQn is obtained from a hypercubes Qn with add on edges defined by join-
ing any vertex u = u1u2 · · ·un−1un to u¯ = u¯1u¯2 · · · u¯n−1u¯n, where u¯i = 1 − ui is
the complement of ui . The enhanced hypercube Qn,m is obtained from a hyper-
cubes Qn with add on edges defined by joining any vertex u = u1u2 · · ·un−1un to
(u)c = u¯1u¯2 · · · u¯mum+1um+2 · · ·un−1un. Obviously, FQn = Qn,n and FQn and Qn,m
are (n + 1)-regular. Moreover, FQn is a bipartite graph if and only if n is odd and
Qn,m is a bipartite graph if and only if m is odd.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we prove some
new spanning properties of the hypercubes Qn. In Sect. 3, we prove that the folded
hypercubes FQn is super spanning laceable if n is an odd integer and super span-
ning connected if otherwise. In Sect. 4, we prove that the enhanced hypercubes Qn,m
is super spanning laceable if m is an odd integer and super spanning connected if
otherwise. In the final section, we give our concluding remark.
2 The super spanning laceability of hypercubes
In this section, we review some known results and prove a new theorem. Let u =
u1u2 · · ·un be a vertex of Qn. We use (u)k = u1 · · ·uk−1u¯kuk+1 · · ·un−1un to denote

Fig. 1 Illustration for Theorem 1
Case 1: (yk)i = 0 for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Since Qn is edge transitive, we assume that
(yk)n = 0. Thus, yk ∈ Q0n−1. For 0 ≤ j ≤ 1, we set Uj = {yi | yi ∈ Qjn−1 for 1 ≤
i ≤ k}. Without loss of generality, we assume that U0 = {ym+1,ym+2, . . . ,yk} ⊆
Q0n−1 and U1 = {y1,y2, . . . ,ym} ⊆ Q1n−1 for some 0 ≤ m ≤ k − 1.
Subcase 1.1: m = 0. Let U˜ = U0 − {yk−1}. Obviously, |U˜ | = k − 1. By induc-
tion, there is a spanning (x, U˜ )-fan, {R1,R2, . . . ,Rk−1}, of Q0n−1. Without loss of
generality, we assume that yk−1 ∈ Rk−1 where Rk−1 is joining x to yt for some
t ∈ {1,2, . . . , k − 2, k}. We can write Rk−1 as 〈x,H1,yk−1, z,H2,yt 〉. (Note that z
= yk if l(H2) = 0.) By Lemma 2, there is a Hamiltonian path W of Q1n−1 joining
(x)n to (z)n. We set Pi = Ri for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2, Pk−1 = 〈x,H1,yk−1〉, and
Pk = 〈x, (x)n,W, (z)n, z,H2,yt 〉. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk} forms a set of required paths
of Qn. See Fig. 1(a) for an illustration for k = 6 and t = 6.
Subcase 1.2: m = 1. Thus, y1 ∈ Q1n−1. By induction, there is a spanning (x,U0)-fan,
{R1,R2, . . . ,Rk−1}, in Q0n−1 such that Ri joins x to yi+1 for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. By
Lemma 2, there is a Hamiltonian path W of Q1n−1 joining (x)n to y1. We set P1 =〈x, (x)n,W,y1〉 and Pi = Ri−1 for every 2 ≤ i ≤ k. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk} forms a
spanning (x,U)-fan of Qn. See Fig. 1(b) for an illustration for k = 6.
72 C.-H. Chang et al.
(x)n is an odd vertex, u is an even vertex and (u)n is an odd vertex in Q0n−1.
(Note that yk−1 = u if l(H1) = 0 or (x)n = yk if l(H2) = 0.) By induction, there
is a spanning (x,U0 ∪ {(u)n})-fan, {R1,R2, . . . ,Rk−1} in Q0n−1 such that (1) Rijoins x to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2 and (2) Rk−1 joins x to (u)n. We set Pi = Ri for
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2, Pk−1 = 〈x,Rk−1, (u)n,u,H−11 ,yk−1〉, and Pk = 〈x, (x)n,H2,yk〉.
Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk} forms a spanning (x,U)-fan of Qn. See Fig. 1(f) for an il-
lustration for k = 6.
Subcase 2.2: m = k−3. We have n ≥ 5 and {yk−2,yk−1,yk} ⊆ Q1n−1. Since m+1 ≤
n− 2 < 2n−2, we can pick an even vertex z ∈ Q0n−1 − ({yi | 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 3} ∪ {x}). By
Lemma 3, there exist two disjoint paths S1 and S2 of Q1n−1 such that (1) S1 joins (z)n
to yk−2, (2) S2 joins (x)n to yk−1, and (3) S1 ∪S2 spans Q1n−1. Obviously, yk ∈ Si for
some 1 ≤ i ≤ 2.
Subcase 2.2.1: yk ∈ S1. We write S1 as 〈(z)n,H1,yk,u,H2,yk−2〉. Obviously, u is an
even vertex and (u)n is an odd vertex in Q0n−1. Let U˜0 = U0 ∪ {z, (u)n}. Obviously,
|U˜0| = k − 1. By induction, there is a spanning (x, U˜0)-fan, {R1,R2, . . . ,Rk−1},
in Q0n−1 such that (1) Ri joins x to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 3, (2) Rk−2 joins x
to z, and (3) Rk−1 joins x to (u)n. We set Pi = Ri for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 3, Pk−2 =
〈x,Rk−1, (u)n,u,H2,yk−2〉, Pk−1 = 〈x, (x)n, S2,yk−1〉, and Pk = 〈x,Rk−2, z, (z)n,
H1,yk〉. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk} forms a spanning (x,U)-fan of Qn. See Fig. 1(g) for
an illustration for k = 6.
Subcase 2.2.2: yk ∈ S2. Similar to Subcase 2.2.1, there is a spanning (x,U)-fan
of Qn.
Subcase 2.3: 1 ≤ m ≤ k − 4. We have k ≥ 5. Moreover, n ≥ 5. Since m ≤ k − 4 and
k ≤ n, |U0| = m ≤ k − 4 ≤ n − 4.
We claim that there exists an even vertex u in Q1n−1 − U1 such that (yi )n /∈
NQ1n−1
(u) for every 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Such claim holds because (n−1)|U0|+ |U1 −{yk}| =
(n− 1)m+ (k −m)− 1 = (n− 2)m+ k − 1 ≤ (n− 2)(n− 4)+n− 1 = (n− 1)(n−
4) + 3 < 2n−2 for all n ≥ 5.
Let U˜1 = (U1 − {yk}) ∪ {(x)n}. Obviously, |U˜1| = k − m. By induction, there is
a spanning (u, U˜1)-fan, {Wm+1,Wm+2, . . . ,Wk}, in Q1n−1 joining u to U˜1 such that
(1) Wi joins u to yi for every m + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and (2) Wk joins u to (x)n. We
write Wi as 〈u,vi ,W ′i ,yi〉 for every m + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Since u is an even vertex
in Q1n−1, vi is an odd vertex in Q1n−1 and (vi )n is an even vertex in Q
0
n−1 for every
m + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2.
Subcase 2.3.1: yk ∈ Wk . We write Wk as 〈u,H1, z,yk,H2, (x)n〉. Since yk is an
odd vertex in Q1n−1, z is an even vertex in Q1n−1, and (z)n is an odd vertex
in Q0n−1. Let U˜0 = U0 ∪ {(vi )n|m + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2} ∪ {(z)n}. Obviously, |U˜0| =
m + (k − m − 2) + 1 = k − 1. By induction, there is a spanning (x, U˜0)-fan,
{R1,R2, . . . ,Rk−1}, in Q0n−1 such that (1) Ri joins x to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, (2) Ri joins
x to (vi )n for every m + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2, and (3) Rk−1 joins x to (z)n. We set Pi = Ri
for every 1 ≤ i ≤ m, Pi = 〈x,Ri, (vi )n,vi ,W ′i ,yi〉 for every m + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2,
Pk−1 = 〈x,Rk−1, (z)n, z,H−11 ,u,vk−1,W ′k−1,yk−1〉, and Pk = 〈x, (x)n,H−12 ,yk〉.

Fig. 2 Illustration for Lemma 5
Subcase 1.2: n ≥ 4. Since FQ0n−1 is isomorphic to Qn−1, by Lemma 2, there is an
(n − 1)∗-container {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn−1} of FQ0n−1 between x and y.
Subcase 1.2.1: (x)c = (y)n. Obviously, (x)c and (y)c are of different parity. Since
FQ1n−1 is isomorphic to Qn−1, by Lemma 3, there exist two disjoint paths S1 and S2
of FQ1n−1 such that (1) S1 joins (x)n to (y)n, (2) S2 joins (x)c to (y)c , and (3) S1 ∪
S2 spans FQ1n−1. We set Pn = 〈x, (x)n, S1, (y)n,y〉 and Pn+1 = 〈x, (x)c, S2, (y)c,y〉.
Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn+1} forms an (n + 1)∗-container of FQn between x and y. See
Fig. 2(a) for illustration for n = 5.
Subcase 1.2.2: (x)c = (y)n. Then (y)c = (x)n and n is even.
Suppose that n = 4. We have x = 0000 and y = 1110. We set P1 = 〈0000,0001,
1110〉, P2 = 〈0000,0010,0110,1110〉, P3 = 〈0000,0100,0101,0111,0011,1011,
1001,1101,1100,1110〉, P4 = 〈0000,1000, 1010,1110〉, and P5 = 〈0000,1111,
1110〉. Then {P1,P2,P3,P4,P5} forms a 5∗-container of FQ4 between x and y.
Since 2n−1 − 2 ≥ 3(n − 1) for n ≥ 6, there is one path Pi in {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn−1}
such that I (Pi) ≥ 3. Without loss of generality, we may assume that I (Pn−1) ≥ 3.
We write Pn−1 as 〈x,u,v,H,y〉 where u is an odd vertex and v is an even ver-
tex. By Lemma 4, there is a Hamiltonian path W of Q1n−1 − {(x)n, (y)n} joining
(u)n to (v)n. We set P ′n−1 = 〈x,u, (u)n,W, (v)n,v,H,y〉, Pn = 〈x, (x)n = (y)c,y〉,
and Pn+1 = 〈x, (x)c = (y)n,y〉. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn−2,P ′n−1,Pn,Pn+1} forms an
(n + 1)∗-container of FQn between x and y. See Fig. 2(b) for illustration for n = 6.
Case 2: y ∈ FQ1n−1. We have the following cases:
Subcase 2.1: n is odd and y ∈ {(x)n, (x)c}. By Theorem 2, we only consider that
y = (x)c . By Lemma 2, there is an n∗-container {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn} of Qn between x
and y. We set Pn+1 = 〈x,y〉. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn+1} forms an (n+ 1)∗-container of
FQn between x and y.
76 C.-H. Chang et al.
words, we still get FQn if we relabel all the vertices u with f (u). However, f (x) = x
is an even vertex and f (y) = ((y)c)n is an odd vertex. By Lemma 5, there exists a
k∗-container of FQn between f (x) and f (y) for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Thus, there
exists a k∗-container of FQn between x and y for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1. This theorem
is proved. 

Let u = u1u2 · · ·un−1un be a vertex of Qn,m. Similar to before, c-neighbor of u
in Qn,m, (u)c , is u¯1u¯2 · · · u¯mum+1um+2 · · ·un−1un. Note that (u)c and u are of the
same parity if and only if m is even. Let Ec = {(u1u2 · · ·un, u¯1u¯2 · · · u¯mum+1um+2 · · ·
un−1un)|u1u2 · · ·un ∈ V (Qn,m)}. By definition, the n-dimensional enhanced hyper-
cube Qn,m is obtained from Qn by adding Ec. Obviously, Qn,m is FQn if m = n.
We use Qjn,m to denote the subgraph of Qn,m induced by {v ∈ V (Qn,m) | (v)n = j}
for 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. Moreover, we use Qijn,m to denote the subgraph of Qn,m induced by
{v ∈ V (Qn,m)|(v)n−1 = i and (v)n = j} for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 1.
Lemma 6 Let x and y be any two distinct vertices of Qjn,m with n − m ≥ 1 for
some j . Suppose that there is a k∗-container of Qjn,m between x and y and there is
an 1∗-container of Q1−jn,m between (x)n and (y)n. Then there is a (k + 1)∗-container
of Qn,m between x and y.
Proof Let {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk} be a k∗-container of Qjn,m between x and y and W be
a Hamiltonian path of Q1−jn,m joining (x)n to (y)n. Set Pk+1 = 〈x, (x)n,W, (y)n,y〉.
Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk+1} forms a (k + 1)∗-container of Qn,m between x and y. 
Lemma 7 Let x be an even vertex and y be an odd vertex of Qn,n−1 for any positive
integer n ≥ 3. Then there exists a k∗-container of Qn,n−1 between x and y for every
1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1.
Proof Since Qn is a spanning subgraph of Qn,n−1, by Lemma 2, there exists a k∗-
container of Qn,n−1 between x and y for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Thus, we only need to
construct an (n + 1)∗-container of Qn,n−1 between x and y. Without loss of general-
ity, we assume that x ∈ Q00n,n−1. We have the following cases:
Case 1: y ∈ Q00n,n−1 ∪ Q10n,n−1. Since Q00n,n−1 ∪ Q10n,n−1 = Q0n,n−1 is isomorphic to
FQn−1, by Lemma 5, there exists an n∗-container of Q0n,n−1 between x and y. Since
Q01n,n−1 ∪ Q11n,n−1 = Q1n,n−1 is isomorphic to FQn−1, by Lemma 5, there exists a
Hamiltonian path of Q1n,n−1 joining (x)n to (y)n. By Lemma 6, there exists an
(n + 1)∗-container of Qn,n−1 between x and y.
Case 2: y ∈ Q01n,n−1. Suppose that n = 3. We have x = 000 and y = 001. We set
P1 = 〈000,001〉, P2 = 〈000,010,011,001〉, P3 = 〈000,100,101,001〉, and P4 =
〈000,110,111,001〉. Then {P1,P2,P3,P4} forms a 4∗-container of Q3,2 between
x and y.

Lemma 8 Let x be an even vertex and y be an odd vertex of Qn,m for any two
positive integers n ≥ m ≥ 2. Then there exists a k∗-container of Qn,m between x and
y for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1.
Proof Since Q2,2 is isomorphic to complete graph K4, this statement holds for n = 2.
Suppose that n ≥ 3.
Since Qn is a spanning subgraph of Qn,m, by Lemma 2, there exists a k∗-container
of Qn,m between x and y for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Thus, we only need to construct an
(n + 1)∗-container of Qn,m between x and y. Without loss of generality, we assume
that x ∈ Q00n,m. We prove our claim by induction on t = n − m. The induction bases
are t = 0 and 1. By Lemma 5, our claim holds for t = 0. With Lemma 7, our claim
holds for t = 1. Consider t ≥ 2 and assume that our claim holds for (t − 1). We have
the following cases:
Case 1: y ∈ Q00n,m ∪Q10n,m. Since Q00n,m ∪Q10n,m is isomorphic to Qn−1,m, by induction,
there exists an n∗-container of Q00n,m ∪ Q10n,m between x and y. Since Q01n,m ∪ Q11n,m
is isomorphic to Qn−1,m, by induction, there is a Hamiltonian path of Q01n,m ∪ Q11n,m
joining (x)n to (y)n. Thus, by Lemma 6, there exists an (n + 1)∗-container of Qn,m
between x and y.

Theorem 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path R in Q0n,n−1 joining x to z and there exists
a Hamiltonian path H in Q1n,n−1 joining (z)n to y. Set P = 〈x,R, z, (z)n,H,y〉. Thus,
P forms a Hamiltonian path in Qn,n−1 joining x to y. See Fig. 5(b) for illustration. 
Lemma 10 Q3,2 is super spanning connected.
Proof Let x and y be any two different vertices of Q3,2. By Lemma 9, Q3,2 is
1∗-connected and 2∗-connected. Hence, we need to construct a 3∗-container and a
4∗-container between x and y. Without loss of generality, we assume that x = 000.
By Lemma 7, this statement holds if y is an odd vertex. Thus, we assume that y is an
even vertex. We list all possible cases as follows:

Lemma 11 Suppose that n ≥ 3 is an odd integer. Let x and y be any two different
even vertices of Qn,n−1. Then there exists a k∗-container of Qn,n−1 between x and y
for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1.
Proof By Lemma 10, this statement holds for Q3,2. Thus, we assume that n ≥ 5. By
Lemma 9, Qn,n−1 is 1∗-connected and 2∗-connected. Thus, we need to construct a
k∗-container between x and y for every 3 ≤ k ≤ n+ 1. Without loss of generality, we
assume that x ∈ Q00n,n−1.

Lemma 11
by Theorem 3, there exists a k∗-container {R1,R2, . . . ,Rk} of Q00n,n−1 ∪ Q10n,n−1 be-
tween x and v. We write Ri = 〈x,R′i ,ui ,v〉 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Let A = {u1,u2, . . . ,uk}.
Since k ≥ 3, at most one vertex of A is an even vertex. Without loss of general-
ity, we assume that {u1,u2, . . . ,uk−1} is a set of (k − 1) odd vertices. Obviously,
{(ui )n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} is a set of (k − 1) even vertices of Q01n,n−1 ∪ Q11n,n−1. Since
Qn−1 is a spanning subgraph of Q01n,n−1 ∪Q11n,n−1, by Theorem 1, there is a spanning
(y, {(ui )n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} ∪ {(v)n})-fan, {H1,H2, . . . ,Hk}, of Q01n,n−1 ∪Q11n,n−1 such
that (1) Hi joins (ui )n to y for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and (2) Hk joins (v)n to y. We set
Pi = 〈x,R′i ,ui , (ui )n,Hi,y〉 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and Pk = 〈x,R′k,uk,v, (v)n,Hk,y〉.
Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pk} forms a k∗-container of Qn,n−1 between x and y. See Fig. 6(d)
for illustration. 
Lemma 12 Suppose that n ≥ 3 and m is even. Let x and y be any two different even
vertices of Qn,m. Then there exists a Hamiltonian path P of Qn,m between x and y.
Proof For the fixed number m, we prove this statement by induction on t = n − m.
Suppose that x and y be any two different even vertices of Qn,m. By Lemma 10, this
statement holds for t = 1. Consider t ≥ 2 and assume that our claim holds for (t −1).
Without loss of generality, we assume that x ∈ Q0n,m.
Suppose that y ∈ Q0n,m. Since Q0n,m is isomorphic to Qn−1,m, by induction, there
exists a Hamiltonian path R = 〈x,v,R′,y〉 in Q0n,m joining x to y and there exists a
Hamiltonian path H in Q1n,m joining (x)n to (v)n. Set P = 〈x, (x)n,H, (v)n,v,R′,y〉.
Thus, P forms a Hamiltonian path in Qn,m joining x to y.

Lemma 13
1 ≤ i ≤ n− 3, write Rn−2 as 〈x,R′n−2, (v)c,v〉, write Rn−1 as 〈x,R′n−1, (y)n,v〉, and
write Rn as 〈x,R′n, (v)n−1,v〉. Let A = {(ui )n | 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3}. Obviously, A is a set
of (n − 3) even vertices of Q11n,m.
By Lemma 2, there exists an (n − 2)∗-container {H1,H2, . . . ,Hn−2} of Q11n,m be-
tween z and y. Since y is adjacent to (n − 1) vertices in Q11n,m and (z,y) ∈ E(Q11n,m),
one of these paths is 〈z,y〉 and (y)c ∈ Hi for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2. Without loss of
generality, we assume that (y)c ∈ Hn−3. We can write Hi as 〈z, (ui )n,H ′i ,y〉 for
1 ≤ i ≤ n−4, write Hn−3 as 〈z, (un−3)n,H ′n−3, (y)c,w,H ′′n−3,y〉, and write Hn−2 as〈z,y〉. Obviously, w is an odd vertex. We set Pi = 〈x,R′i ,ui , (ui )n,H ′i ,y〉 for 1 ≤ i ≤
n − 4, Pn−3 = 〈x,R′n−3,un−3, (un−3)n,H ′n−3, (y)c,y〉, Pn−2 = 〈x,R′n−2, (v)c,v, z,
Hn−2,y〉, and Pn−1 = 〈x, R′n−1, (y)n,y〉.
Suppose that (y)n−1 = (x)n. By Lemma 1, there exists a Hamiltonian path S of
Q01n,m − {(x)n} joining ((v)n−1)n to (w)n−1. Set Pn = 〈x,R′n, (v)n−1, ((v)n−1)n, S,
(w)n−1,w,H ′′n−3,y〉 and Pn+1 = 〈x, (x)n = (y)n−1,y〉. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn+1}
forms an (n + 1)∗-container of Qn,m between x and y. See Fig. 7(a) for illustration.
Now, we consider (y)n−1 = (x)n. By Lemma 3, there exist two disjoint paths S1
and S2 of Q11m,n such that (1) S1 joins ((v)n−1)n to (y)n−1, (2) S2 joins (x)n to (w)n−1,
and (3) S1 ∪ S2 spans Q01n,n−1. Set Pn = 〈x,R′n, (v)n−1, ((v)n−1)n, S1, (y)n−1,y〉
and Pn+1 = 〈x, (x)n, S2, (w)n−1,w,H ′′n−3,y〉. Then {P1,P2, . . . ,Pn+1} forms an
(n + 1)∗-container of Qn,m between x and y. See Fig. 7(b) for illustration. 
With Lemma 8 and Lemma 13, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4 The enhanced hypercube Qn,m is super spanning laceable if m is an odd
integer and Qn,m is super spanning connected if m is an even integer.
Proof Since Q2,2 is isomorphic to complete graph K4. Obviously, this theorem holds
for n = 2. By Lemma 8, this theorem holds if n ≥ 3 and m is an odd integer. Thus,
we suppose that n ≥ 3 and m is an even integer. Let x and y be any two different

SUMMARY Let u and v be any two distinct vertices of an undirected
graph G, which is k-connected. For 1 ≤ w ≤ k, a w-container C(u, v) of
a k-connected graph G is a set of w-disjoint paths joining u and v. A w-
container C(u, v) of G is a w∗-container if it contains all the vertices of G.
A graph G is w∗-connected if there exists a w∗-container between any two
distinct vertices. Let κ(G) be the connectivity of G. A graph G is super
spanning connected if G is i∗-connected for 1 ≤ i ≤ κ(G). In this paper,
we prove that the n-dimensional burnt pancake graph Bn is super spanning
connected if and only if n  2.

1. Introduction
The architecture of an interconnection network is usually
represented as a graph where the vertices represent the pro-
cessor and the edges represent the links between processors.
For the graph definitions and notations, we follow [12]. Let
G = (V, E) be a graph if V is a finite set and E is a subset
of {(a, b) | (a, b) is an unordered pair of V}. We say that
V is the vertex set and E is the edge set. Two vertices u
and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E. We use NbdG(u) to de-
note the set {v | (u, v) ∈ E(G)}. The degree of a vertex
u in G, denoted by degG(u), is |NbdG(u)|. We use δ(G) to
denote min{degG(u) | u ∈ V(G)}. A graph is k-regular if
degG(u) = k for every vertex u in G. A path is a sequence
of adjacent vertices written as 〈v0, v1, . . . , vm〉, in which all
the vertices v0, v1, . . . , vm are distinct except for the possi-
bly that v0 = vm. We also write the path 〈v0, P, vm〉, where
P = 〈v0, v1, . . . , vm〉. The length of a path P, denoted by
l(P), is the number of edges in P. Let u and v be two ver-
tices of G. The distance between u and v denoted by d(u, v)
is the length of the shortest path of G joining u and v. A
cycle is a path with at least three vertices such that the first
vertex is the same as the last one. A hamiltonian cycle is a
cycle of length V(G). A hamiltonian path is a path of length

V(G) − 1.
Connectivity is an important issue for interconnection
networks. The connectivity of a graph G, κ(G), is the mini-
mum number of vertices whose removal leaves the remain-
ing graph disconnected or trivial. Assume that G is a k-
connected graph. It follows from Menger’s Theorem that
there are k internally vertex-disjoint (abbreviated as disjoint)
paths joining any two distinct vertices u and v [22]. A k-
container C(u, v) of G is a set of k disjoint paths joining u to
v. In this paper, we discuss another type of container, called
spanning container. A spanning k-container, (abbreviated
as k∗-container), C(u, v) is a k-container such that it contains
all vertices of G. A graph G is k∗-connected if there exists
a k∗-container between any two distinct vertices. In particu-
lar, a graph G is 1∗-connected if and only if it is hamiltonian
connected, and a graph G is 2∗-connected if and only if it
is hamiltonian. All 1∗-connected graphs except K1 and K2
are 2∗-connected. Thus, we define the spanning connectiv-
ity of a graph G, κ∗(G), to be the largest integer k such that
G is w∗-connected for all 1 ≤ w ≤ k if G is a 1∗-connected
graph. Obviously, spanning connectivity is a hybrid concept
of hamiltonicity and connectivity. A graph G is super span-
ning connected if κ∗(G) = κ(G). Obviously, the complete
graph Kn is super spanning connected if n ≥ 2.
A lot of interconnection networks are proved to be su-
per spanning connected [16], [19], [24]. The spanning con-
nectivity for general graphs are discussed in [17], [18]. The
corresponding concept of spanning connectivity in bipar-
tite graphs is spanning laceability. A lot of interconnec-
tion networks are proved to be super spanning laceable [2],
[3], [11], [15], [16], [19], [21], [23], [24]. The burnt pancake
graphs Bn was proposed by Gates and Papadimitriou [6].
Since then, many interesting properties of the burnt pan-
cake graphs have been studied [5], [9], [13], [14]. In particu-
lar, the burnt pancake graph can be used for genome analy-
sis [7]. In this paper, we prove that the n-dimensional burnt
pancake graph Bn is super spanning connected if and only if
n  2.
2. The Burnt Pancake Graph and Its Properties
Let n be a positive integer. We use 〈n〉 to denote the set
{1, 2, . . . , n}. To save space, the negative sign may be placed
on the top of an expression. Thus, u¯1 = −u1. We use [n] to
denote the set 〈n〉∪ {¯i | i ∈ 〈n〉}. A signed permutation of 〈n〉
is an n-permutation u1u2 . . . un of [n] such that |u1||u2| . . . |un|,

3. Basic Lemmas
The following lemma is a well-known result that gives a
necessary and suﬃcient condition for a system of distinct
representative.
Lemma 7. [8] Let A = {A1, A2, . . . , Am} be a collection
of sets. There exists {x1, x2, . . . , xm} such that xi ∈ Ai for
1 ≤ i ≤ m and xi  x j if i  j if and only if | ∪i∈J Ai| ≥ |J| for
all J ⊆ {1, 2, . . . ,m}.
Lemma 8. Assume that n and k are positive integers with
n ≥ 4 and 3 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Let s and t be two diﬀerent
elements in [n]. Let x1, x2, . . . , xk be k diﬀerent vertices in
Bn with (xi)1 = s¯, (xi)n  t for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, (xi)n  (x1)n
for 2 ≤ i ≤ k, and |(xi)n|  |(xj)n| for 2 ≤ i  j ≤ k.
Let y1, y2, . . . , yk be k diﬀerent vertices in Bn with (yi)1 = ¯t,
(yi)n  s for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, (yi)n  (y1)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ k, and
|(yi)n|  |(yj)n| for 2 ≤ i  j ≤ k. Suppose that {(xi)n | 1 ≤
i ≤ k}  {(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}. Then there exist k disjoint
paths P1, P2, . . . , Pk such that (1) Pi joining xi to yπ(i) for
some permutation π from the set {1, 2, . . . , k} into itself and
(2) ∪ki=1Pi spans B[n]−{s,t}n .
Proof. Since (xi)1 = s¯, (xi)n ∈ V(B{s}n ) and xi  V(B{s}n ).
Since (xi)n  (x1)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ k, and |(xi)n|  |(xj)n| for
2 ≤ i  j ≤ k, xi  V(B{t}n ). Similarly, yi  V(B{s,t}n ) and
(yi)n ∈ V(B{t}n ). Let I be the set {(xi)n | (xi)n = (yj)n for some
1 ≤ i, j ≤ k}. We can reorder the indices of {1, 2, . . . , k} so
that (xi)n = (yi)n for 1 ≤ i ≤ |I|. By Lemma 3, there exists a
hamiltonian path Pi of B{(xi)n}n joining xi to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ |I|.
Since {(xi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}  {(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, |I| < k.
For |I| + 1 ≤ i ≤ k, let Ai = {yj | |I| + 1 ≤ j ≤ k
with (xi)n  −(yj)n}. Obviously, |Ai| ≥ k − 1 − |I|. Thus,
| ∪i∈J Ai| ≥ k − 1 − |I| ≥ |J| if ∅  J ⊂ {|I| + 1, |I| + 2, . . . , k}.
Since {(xi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}  {(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, | ∪ki=|I|+1 Ai| =
k − |I|. By Lemma 7, there exists {yi | |I| + 1 ≤ i ≤ k}
such that (xi)n  −(yi)n and yi  yj for i  j. Let X be
{(xi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} ∪ {(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1} ∪ {s, t}.
Suppose that D([n] − X)  1. By Lemma 3, there ex-
ists a hamiltonian path Pi of B{(xi)n,(yi)n}n joining xi to yi for
|I| + 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. By Lemma 4 and Lemma 5, there
exists a hamiltonian path Pk of B[n]−Xn joining xk to yk. Ob-
viously, {P1, P2, . . . , Pk} forms a set of the required paths.
See Fig. 3 (a) for illustration.
Suppose that D([n]− X) = 1. We claim that |I| < k − 1.
Suppose not. Then {(xk)n,−(xk)n, (yk)n,−(yk)n} ⊂ ([n] − X)
Fig. 3 Illustration for Lemma 8.
and D([n] − X) ≥ 2. We get a contradiction. Let m be the
only positive integer such that {m, m¯} ⊂ [n] − X. Then there
exists a hamiltonian path Pi of B{(xi)n,(yi)n}n joining xi to yi for
|I|+ 1 ≤ i ≤ k− 2. Moreover, there exists a hamiltonian path
Pk−1 of B{(xk−1)n,m,(yk−1)n}n joining xk−1 to yk−1. Furthermore,
there exists a hamiltonian path Pk of B([n]−X)−{m}n joining xk
to yk. Obviously, {P1, P2, . . . , Pk} forms a set of the required
paths. See Fig. 3 (b) for illustration. The lemma is proved.

Lemma 9. Let n ≥ 4 and k be any positive integer with
3 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Let u be any vertex in B{s}n and v be any
vertex in B{t}n such that s  t. Suppose that x1, x2, . . . , xk are
k vertices in Bn with (xi)1 = s¯ and (xi)n  t for 1 ≤ i ≤ k;
and y1, y2, . . . , yk are k vertices in Bn with (yi)1 = ¯t and
(yi)n  s for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Suppose that there exists a permu-
tation π on {1, 2, . . . , k} and k disjoint paths, P1, P2, . . . , Pk,
such that Pi is a path joining xi to yπ(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and
∪ki=1Pi spans B[n]−{s,t}n . Moreover, there are k internal disjoint
paths, S 1, S 2, . . . , S k, of B{s}n such that S i is a path joining u
to (xi)n and ∪ki=1S i spans B{s}n . Furthermore, there are k in-
ternal disjoint paths, T1,T2, . . . ,Tk, of B{t}n such that Ti is
a path joining v to (yi)n and ∪ki=1Ti spans B{t}n . Then there
exists a k∗-container of Bn joining u to v. Moreover, this k∗-
container does not contain the edge (u, v) if (u, v) ∈ E(Bn).
Proof. We set Qi as 〈u, S i, (xi)n, xi, Pi, yπ(i), (yπ(i))n,Tπ(i), v〉
for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Obviously, {Q1,Q2, . . ., Qk} forms the required

Lemma 2, |(zi)1|  |(zj)1| for 1 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 1. Again,
there exists an (n − 1)∗-container of B{t}n , {H1,H2, . . . ,Hn−1},
joining (u)n to v. We write Hi = 〈(u)n,wi,H′i , v〉. (Note that
wi = v if l(Hi) = 1.) Again, (wi)1  {s, t} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
and |(wi)1|  |(wj)1| for 1 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 1. We can reorder
the indices of {1, 2, . . . , n−1} so that {(zi)1 | 1 ≤ i ≤ n−2} 
{(wi)1 | 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2}.
Let xi = (zi)n for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2 and yi = (wi)n for
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2. Obviously, (xi)1 = s, (xi)n  t for 1 ≤ i ≤
n − 2, |(xi)n|  |(xj)n| for 1 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 2. Moreover,
(yi)1 = t, (yi)n  s for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, and |(yi)n|  |(yj)n|
for 1 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 2. Furthermore, {(xi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤
n − 2}  {(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2}. By Lemma 8, there exist a
permutation π on {1, 2, . . . , n − 2} and (n − 2) disjoint paths,
P1, P2, . . . , Pn−2, such that Pi joining xi to yπ(i) and ∪n−2i=1 Pi
spans B[n]−{s,t}n . By assumption, there exist (n − 1) internal
disjoint paths, S 1, S 2, . . . , S n−1, such that S i is a path joining
u to (xi)n for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, S n−1 is a path joining u to (v)n,
and ∪n−1i=1 S i spans B{s}n . Similarly, there exist (n − 1) internal
disjoint paths, T1,T2, . . . ,Tn−1, such that Ti is a path joining
(yi)n to v for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, Tn−1 is a path joining (u)n to
v, and ∪n−1i=1 Ti spans B{t}n . By Lemma 11, there exists an n∗-
container between u and v. See Fig. 7 for illustration. The
lemma is proved. 
Lemma 13. Assume that n ≥ 4. Let u be any vertex in B{s}n
with (u)n ∈ V(B{t}n ) and v be any vertex in B{t}n with v  (u)n
and (v)n  V(B{s}n ). Suppose that x1, x2, . . . , xn−1 are (n − 1)
vertices in Bn with (xi)1 = s¯ and (xi)n  t for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1;
and y1, y2, . . . , yn−1 are (n − 1) vertices in Bn with (yi)1 = ¯t
and (yi)n  s for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Moreover, (v)n = yn−1.
Suppose that there exist a permutation π on {1, 2, . . . , n − 1}
and (n − 1) disjoint paths, P1, P2, . . . , Pn−1, such that Pi is a
path joining xi to yπ(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and ∪n−1i=1 Pi spans
B[n]−{s,t}n . Moreover, there are (n − 1) internal disjoint paths,
S 1, S 2, . . . , S n−1, of B{s}n such that S i is a path joining u to
(xi)n for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and ∪n−1i=1 S i spans B{s}n . Furthermore,
there are (n − 1) internal disjoint paths, T1,T2, . . . ,Tn−1, of
B{t}n such that Ti is a path joining v to (yi)n for 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 2,
Tn−1 is a path joining (u)n to v, and ∪n−1i=1 Ti spans B{t}n . Then
there exists an n∗-container of Bn joining u to v.
Fig. 7 Illustration for Lemma 12.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that π(n −
1) = n − 1. Let Qi = 〈u, S i, (xi)n, xi, Pi, yπ(i), (yπ(i))n,Tπ(i), v〉
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, Qn−1 = 〈u, S n−1, (xn−1)n, xn−1,
Pn−1, yn−1 = (v)n, v〉, and Qn = 〈u, (u)n,Tn−1, v〉. Then
{Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qn} forms an n∗-container between u and v.
See Fig. 8 for illustration. The lemma is proved. 
Lemma 14. Assume that n ≥ 4. Let u be any vertex in B{s}n
with (u)n ∈ V(B{t}n ) and v be any vertex in B{t}n with v  (u)n
and (v)n  V(B{s}n ). Suppose that Bn−1 is (n − 1)∗-connected.
Then there is an n∗-container of Bn between u and v.
Proof. Since (u)n ∈ V(B{t}n ), |s|  |t| and (u)1 = ¯t. We set
z be the vertex with (z)1 = t and (z)i = (u)i for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Thus, z ∈ V(B{s}n ).
By assumption, there exists an (n−1)∗-container of B{s}n ,
{R1,R2, . . . ,Rn−1}, joining u to z. We write Ri = 〈u,R′i , zi, z〉.
(Note that zi = u if l(Ri) = 1.) Obviously, (zi)1  {s, t}
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. By Lemma 2, |(zi)1|  |(zj)1| for 1 ≤
i  j ≤ n − 1. Again, there exists an (n − 1)∗-container of
B{t}n , {H1,H2, . . . ,Hn−1}, joining (u)n to v. We write Hi =
〈(u)n,wi,H′i , v〉. (Note that wi = v if l(Hi) = 1.) Again,
(wi)1  {s, t} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and |(wi)1|  |(wj)1| for 1 ≤
i  j ≤ n − 1. We can reorder the indices of {1, 2, . . . , n − 1}
so that {(zi)1 | 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}  {(wi)1 | 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}.
Let x1 = (z)n and xi = (zi)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1. Similarly,
y1 = (v)n and yi = (wi)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Obviously,
(xi)1 = s, (xi)n  t for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, (xi)n  (x1)n for
2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and |(xi)n|  |(xj)n| for 2 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 1.
Moreover, (yi)1 = t, (yi)n  s for 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1, (yi)n  (y1)n
for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and |(yi)n|  |(yj)n| for 2 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 1.
Furthermore, (x1)n = (y1)n = ¯t, and {(xi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} 
{(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}.
By Lemma 8, there exist a permutation π on
{1, 2, . . . , n − 1} and (n − 1) disjoint paths, P1, P2, . . . , Pn−1,
such that Pi joining xi to yπ(i) and ∪ni=1Pi spans B[n]−{s,t}n .
By assumption, there exist (n − 1) internal disjoint paths,
S 1, S 2, . . . , S n−1, such that S i is a path joining u to (xi)n for
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and ∪n−1i=1 S i spans B{s}n . Similarly, there exist(n − 1) internal disjoint paths, T1,T2, . . . ,Tn−1, such that Ti
is a path joining (yi)n to v for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 and ∪n−1i=1 Ti spans
B{t}n . By Lemma 13, there exists an n∗-container between u
and v. See Fig. 9 for illustration. The lemma is proved. 

Fig. 12 Illustration for Lemma 17.
Similarly, y1 = (w)n, yi = (wi)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and
yn = (v)n. Obviously, (xi)1 = s, (xi)n  t for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
(xi)n  (x1)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ n, and |(xi)n|  |(xj)n| for 2 ≤
i  j ≤ n. Moreover, (yi)1 = t, (yi)n  s for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
(yi)n  (y1)n for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and |(yi)n|  |(yj)n| for
2 ≤ i  j ≤ n − 1. Note that (x1)n = ¯t and (y1)n = s¯ if
s  t; and (x1)n = r¯ and (y1)n = r if s = t. Thus, {(xi)n |
1 ≤ i ≤ n}  {(yi)n | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Moreover, {|(xi)n| | 1 ≤
i ≤ n} = 〈n〉 − {|s|} and {|(yi)n| | 1 ≤ i ≤ n} = 〈n〉 − {|t|}.
By Lemma 16, there exist a permutation π on {1, 2, . . . , n}
and n disjoint paths, P1, P2, . . . , Pn, such that Pi joining xi
to yπ(i) and ∪ni=1Pi spans B[n]−{s,t}n . By assumption, there exist(n − 1) internal disjoint paths, S 1, S 2, . . . , S n−1, such that S i
is a path joining u to (xi)n for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and ∪n−1i=1 S i
spans B{s}n . Similarly, there exist (n − 1) internal disjoint
paths, T1,T2, . . . ,Tn−1, such that Ti is a path joining (yi)n to
v for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and ∪n−1i=1 Ti spans B{t}n . By Lemma 15,
there exists an n∗-container between u and v. See Fig. 12 for
illustration. The lemma is proved. 
4. Main Result
Theorem 2. Bn is n∗-connected for any positive integer n.
Proof. We prove this theorem by induction. It is easy to
see that B1 is 1∗-connected and B2 is 2∗-connected. Since
the B3 is vertex transitive, by brute force, we have checked
that B3 is 3∗-connected. We list the result in the appendix.
Assume that Bk is k∗-connected for every 3 ≤ k ≤ n −
1. Let u and v be any two distinct vertices of Bn with u ∈
V(B{s}n ) and v ∈ V(B{t}n ). We need to find an n∗-container
between u and v of Bn. Suppose that s = t. By induction,
there exists an (n − 1)∗-container of B{s}n joining u to v. By
Lemma 6, there is an n∗-container of Bn joining u to v. Thus,
we assume that s  t.
Case 1: (u)n ∈ V(B{t}n ) and (v)n ∈ V(B{s}n ).
Suppose that u = (v)n. By Lemma 10, there is an
(n − 1)∗-container {Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qn−1} of Bn joining u to
v not using the edge (u, v). We set Qn as 〈u, v〉. Then
{Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qn} forms an n∗-container of Bn joining u to
v. Suppose that u  (v)n. By Lemma 12, there is an n∗-
container of Bn joining u to v.
Case 2: ((u)n ∈ V(B{t}n ) and (v)n  V(B{s}n )) or ((u)n  V(B{t}n )
and (v)n ∈ V(B{s}n )). Without loss of generality, we assume
that (u)n ∈ V(B{t}n ) and (v)n  V(B{s}n ). By Lemma 14, there
is an n∗-container of Bn joining u to v.
Case 3: (u)n  V(B{t}n ) and (v)n  V(B{s}n ). By Lemma 17,
there is an n∗-container of Bn joining u to v.
The theorem is proved. 
Theorem 3. Bn is super spanning connected if and only if
n  2.
Proof. We prove this theorem by induction. Obviously,
this theorem is true for B1. Since P2 is isomorphic to a cycle
with eight vertices, B2 is not 1∗-connected. Thus, B2 is not
super spanning connected. By Theorem 1 and Theorem 2,
this theorem holds on B3. Assume that Bk is super spanning
connected for every 3 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. By Theorem 1 and
Theorem 2, Bn is k∗-connected for any k ∈ {1, 2, n}. Thus,
we still need to construct a k∗-container of Bn between any
two distinct vertices u ∈ V(B{s}n ) and v ∈ V(B{t}n ) for every
3 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
Suppose that s = t. By induction, Bn−1 is (k − 1)∗-
connected. By Lemma 6, there is a k∗-container of Bn join-
ing u to v. Suppose that s  t. By induction, Bn−1 is k∗-
connected. By Lemma 10, there is a k∗-container of Bn join-
ing u to v.
Hence, the theorem is proved. 
5. Conclusion
Graph containers do exist in engineering designed informa-
tion and telecommunication networks and in biological neu-
ral systems. See [1], [12] and their references. The study of
w-container and their w∗-versions plays a pivotal role in de-
sign and implementation of parallel routing and eﬃcient in-
formation transmission in large-scale network system. In bi-
ological informatics and neuroinformatics, the existence and
structure of a w∗-container signifies the cascade eﬀect in sig-
nal transduction system and the reaction in a metabolic path-
way. Recently, there are a lot studies on w∗-container [2],
[3], [11], [16], [19], [21], [24]. In this paper, we prove that
the burnt pancake graph Bn is super connected for n  2.
Assume that G is k∗-connected.We may also define the
k∗-connected distance between any two vertices u and v, de-
noted by dsk(u, v), which is the minimum length among all
k∗- containers between u and v. The k∗-diameter of G, de-
note by Dsk(G), is max{dsk(u, v) | u and v are two diﬀerent
vertices of G}. In particular, we are intrigued in Dsκ(G)(G)
and Ds2(G). There are some studies on the k∗-diameter
of some interconnection networks [4], [20]. Later, we will
study Dsn(Bn) and Ds2(Bn).

Let G be a graph. The connectivity of G, κ(G), is the maximum integer k such that there
exists a k-container between any two different vertices. A k-container of G between u and
v, Ck(u, v), is a set of k-internally-disjoint paths between u and v. A spanning container is a
container that spans V (G). A graph G is k∗-connected if there exists a spanning k-container
between any two different vertices. The spanning connectivity of G, κ∗(G), is the maximum
integer k such that G isw∗-connected for 1 ≤ w ≤ k if G is 1∗-connected.
Let x be a vertex inG and letU = {y1, y2, . . . , yk} be a subset of V (G)where x is not inU .
A spanning k− (x,U)-fan, Fk(x,U), is a set of internally-disjoint paths {P1, P2, . . . , Pk} such
that Pi is a path connecting x to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and∪ki=1 V (Pi) = V (G). A graph G is k∗-fan-
connected (or k∗f -connected) if there exists a spanning Fk(x,U)-fan for every choice of x and
U with |U| = k and x 6∈ U . The spanning fan-connectivity of a graph G, κ∗f (G), is defined as
the largest integer k such that G isw∗f -connected for 1 ≤ w ≤ k if G is 1∗f -connected.
In this paper, some relationship between κ(G), κ∗(G), and κ∗f (G) are discussed.
Moreover, some sufficient conditions for a graph to be k∗f -connected are presented.
Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a spanning pipeline-connectivity and discuss
some sufficient conditions for a graph to be k∗-pipeline-connected.

1. Introduction
For graph definitions and notations, we follow [1]. A graph G = (V , E) consists of a finite set V (=(V (G))) and a subset
E (=(E(G))) of {(u, v) | u 6= v and (u, v) is an unordered pair of elements of V }. We say that V is the vertex set and E is the
edge set of G. We use n(G) to denote |V (G)|. Two vertices u and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E. A graph H is a subgraph of graph
G if V (H) ⊆ V (G) and E(H) ⊆ E(G). Let S be a subset of V (G). The subgraph of G induced by S, denoted G[S], is the graph
with the vertex set S and the edge set {(u, v) | (u, v) ∈ E(G) and u, v ∈ S}. We use G− S to denote the graph G[V (G)− S].
A vertex cut is a set S ⊆ V (G) such that G− S has more than one component. A graph is k-connected if every vertex cut has
at least k vertices. The connectivity of G, κ(G), is the minimum size of a vertex cut. In other words, κ(G) is the maximum k
such that G is k-connected. A complete graph has no cut set. We adopt the convention that κ(Kn) = n − 1 where Kn is the
complete graph with n vertices. A path is a sequence of vertices represented by 〈v0, v1, . . . , vk〉with no repeated vertex and
(vi, vi+1) is an edge of G for 0 ≤ i ≤ k− 1. We also write the path 〈v0, v1, . . . , vk〉 as 〈v0, . . . , vi,Q , vj, . . . , vk〉where Q is
a subpath from vi to vj. A hamiltonian path of a graph G is a path that contains all vertices of V (G). A graph G is hamiltonian
connected if there is a hamiltonian path between every two different vertices. A cycle is a path with at least three vertices

{(yi, y) | yi ∈ U ′} to obtain a k∗-container between x to y. Hence, G is k∗-connected. Therefore, κ∗f (G) ≤ κ∗(G) for every
1∗f -connected graph.
Suppose that G is not a complete graph. There exists a vertex cut S of size κ(G). Let x and y be any two vertices in different
connected components of G− S. Obviously, y is not in any (x, S)-fan of G. Thus, κ∗f (G) < κ(G). 
3. Some sufficient conditions for a graph to be k∗f -connected
Since the concept of spanning fan-connectivity is a generalization of hamiltonicity, we review some previews results
concerning hamiltonian graphs and hamiltonian connected graphs.
Lemma 2 ([12]). Every graph G with at least three vertices and δ(G) ≥ n(G)2 is 2∗-connected. Moreover, every graph G with at
least four vertices and δ(G) ≥ n(G)2 + 1 is 1∗-connected.
Lemma 3 ([13,14]). Let u and v be two non-adjacent vertices of G with dG(u) + dG(v) ≥ n(G). Then G is 2∗-connected if and
only if G + (u, v) is 2∗-connected. Moreover, suppose that dG(u) + dG(v) ≥ n(G) + 1, then G is 1∗-connected if and only if
G+ (u, v) is 1∗-connected.
Lemma 4 ([15]). A graph G is 2∗-connected if dG(u)+ dG(v) ≥ n(G) for all non-adjacent vertices u and v. Moreover, a graph G
is 1∗-connected if dG(u)+ dG(v) ≥ n(G)+ 1 for all non-adjacent vertices u and v.
For comparison, we list the preview results concerning spanning connectivity.
Lemma 5 ([8]). κ∗(G) ≥ 2δ(G)− n(G)+ 2 if n(G)2 + 1 ≤ δ(G) ≤ n(G)− 2.
Lemma 6 ([9]). Let k be a positive integer. Suppose that u and v are twonon-adjacent vertices of Gwith dG(u)+dG(v) ≥ n(G)+k.
Then κ∗(G) ≥ k+ 2 if and only if κ∗(G+ (u, v)) ≥ k+ 2.
Lemma 7 ([9]). Let k be a positive integer. Then κ∗(G) ≥ k + 2 if dG(u) + dG(v) ≥ n(G) + k for all non-adjacent vertices u
and v.
Note that Lemma 5 (Lemmas 6 and 7, respectively) generalizes the result of Lemma 2, (Lemmas 3 and 4, respectively) in
spanning connectivity. The following theorem on spanning fan-connectivity is analogous to that on spanning connectivity
in Lemma 6 [9].
Lemma 8. Let u and v be two non-adjacent vertices of G with dG(u) + dG(v) ≥ n(G) + 1, and let x and y be any two distinct
vertices of G. Then G has a hamiltonian path joining x to y if and only if G+ (u, v) has a hamiltonian path joining x to y.
Proof. Since every path inG is a path inG+(u, v), there is a hamiltonian path ofG+(u, v) joining x to y ifG has a hamiltonian
path joining x to y.
Suppose that there is a hamiltonian path P of G + (u, v) joining x to y. We need to show that there is a hamiltonian
path of G between x and y. If (u, v) 6∈ E(P), then P is a hamiltonian path of G between x and y. Thus, we consider that
(u, v) ∈ E(P). Without loss of generality, we write P as 〈z1, z2, . . . , zi, zi+1, . . . , zn(G)〉 where z1 = x, zi = u, zi+1 = v,
and zn(G) = y. Since dG(u) + dG(v) ≥ n(G) + 1, there is an index k in {1, 2, . . . , n(G)} − {i − 1, i, i + 1} such that
(zi, zk) ∈ E(G) and (zi+1, zk+1) ∈ E(G).We set R = 〈z1, z2, . . . , zk, zi, zi−1, . . . , zk+1, zi+1, zi+2, . . . , zn(G)〉 if 1 ≤ k ≤ i−2 and
R = 〈z1, z2, . . . , zi, zk, zk−1, . . . , zi+1, zk+1, zk+2, . . . , zn(G)〉 if i+ 2 ≤ k ≤ n(G). Then R is a hamiltonian path of G between x
and y. 
Theorem 2. Assume that k is a positive integer. Let u and v be two non-adjacent vertices of G with dG(u)+ dG(v) ≥ n(G)+ k.
Then κ∗f (G) ≥ k+ 1 if and only if κ∗f (G+ (u, v)) ≥ k+ 1.
Proof. Obviously, κ∗f (G + (u, v)) ≥ k + 1 if κ∗f (G) ≥ k + 1. Suppose that κ∗f (G + (u, v)) ≥ k + 1. Let x be any vertex of G
and U = {y1, y2, . . . , yt} be any subset of V (G) such that x 6∈ U and t ≤ k+ 1. We need to find a spanning t-(x,U)-fan of G.
Since G+ (u, v) is (k+ 1)∗f -connected, there exists a spanning t-(x,U)-fan {P1, P2, . . . , Pt} of G+ (u, v)with Pi joining x
to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ t . Obviously, {P1, P2, . . . , Pt} is a spanning t-(x,U)-fan of G if (u, v) is not in ∪ti=1 E(Pi). Thus, we consider
(u, v) ∈ ∪ti=1 E(Pi). By Lemma 3, we can find a spanning (x,U)-fan of G if t = 1, 2. Thus, we consider the case t ≥ 3.Without
loss of generality, we may assume that (u, v) ∈ P1. Therefore, we can write P1 as 〈x,H1, u, v,H2, y1〉. Let P ′i = 〈wi, P ′i , yi〉 be
the path obtained from Pi by deleting x. Thus, we can write Pi as 〈x, wi, P ′i , yi〉 for 1 ≤ i ≤ t . Note that x 6= wi and Pi = 〈yi〉
ifwi = yi for every 2 ≤ i ≤ t .
Case 1: dP ′i (u)+ dP ′i (v) ≥ n(P ′i )+ 2 for some 2 ≤ i ≤ t . Without loss of generality, we may assume that dP ′2(u)+ dP ′2(v) ≥
n(P ′2) + 2. Obviously, n(P ′2) ≥ 2. We write P ′2 = 〈w2 = z1, z2, . . . , zr = y2〉. We claim that there exists an index j in{1, 2, . . . , r − 1} such that (zj, v) ∈ E(G) and (zj+1, u) ∈ E(G). Suppose that this is not the case. Then dP ′2(u) + dP ′2(v) ≤
r + r − (r − 1) = r + 1 = n(P ′2)+ 1. We get a contradiction.

Let R = 〈y1,H−12 , v, u,H−11 , x, w2, P ′2, y2〉. Then
dR(u)+ dR(v) = dP1(u)+ dP1(v)+ dP ′2(u)+ dP ′2(v)
≥ n(P1)+ n(P ′2)+ 1
= n(R)+ 1.
By Lemma 8, there is a hamiltonian pathW of G[R] joining y1 to y2. Thus,W can be written as 〈y1,W1, x,W2, y2〉. We set
Q1 = 〈x,W−11 , y1〉, Q2 = 〈x,W2, y2〉, and Qi = Pi for 3 ≤ i ≤ t . Then {Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qt} forms a spanning (x,U)-fan of G. 
We note that Theorem 2 analogizes the result of Lemma 3 in spanning fan-connectivity. By Theorem 2, we can obtain the
following theorem.
Theorem 3. Let k be a positive integer. Then κ∗f (G) ≥ k + 1 if G is not the complete graph and dG(u) + dG(v) ≥ n(G) + k for
all non-adjacent vertices u and v.
Proof. Let Ec(G) be the set {e | e 6∈ E(G)}. Without loss of generality, we write Ec = {e1, e2, . . . , em}. We set H0 = G and
Hi being the graph with V (Hi) = V (Hi−1) and E(Hi) = E(Hi−1) ∪ {ei} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Since Hm is isomorphic to the
complete graph with n(G) vertices, κ∗f (Hm) ≥ k+ 1. By Theorem 2, κ∗f (G) = κ∗f (H0) ≥ k+ 1. 
Note that Theorem 3 is an analogous result of Lemma 4 in spanning fan-connectivity.
Theorem 4. κ∗f (G) ≥ 2δ(G)− n(G)+ 1 if n(G)2 + 1 ≤ δ(G).
Proof. Suppose that n(G)2 + 1 ≤ δ(G). Obviously, δ(G) ≤ n(G)− 1 and n(G) ≥ 4. Suppose that n(G) = 2m for some integer
m ≥ 2. Then δ(G) = m+ k for some integer kwith 1 ≤ k ≤ m− 1. Obviously, dG(u)+ dG(v) ≥ 2δ(G) = 2m+ 2k for all two
distinct vertices u and v in G. By Theorem 3, κ∗f (G) ≥ 2k + 1 = 2δ(G) − n(G) + 1. Suppose that n(G) = 2m + 1 for some
integerm ≥ 2. Then δ(G) = m+ k+ 1 for some integer kwith 1 ≤ k ≤ m− 1, and dG(u)+ dG(v) ≥ 2δ(G) = 2m+ 2k+ 2
for all two distinct vertices u and v in G. By Theorem 3, κ∗f (G) ≥ 2k+ 2 = 2δ(G)− n(G)+ 1 and the theorem follows. 
Theorem 4 analogizes the result of Lemma 2 in spanning fan-connectivity. Moreover, when δ(G) = n(G) − 2, we have
the following corollary.
Corollary 1. κ∗f (G) = n(G)− 3 if δ(G) = n(G)− 2 and n(G) ≥ 5.
Proof. By Lemma 5, κ∗(G) ≥ n(G)−2. Since n(G)−2 ≤ κ∗(G) ≤ κ(G) ≤ δ(G) = n(G)−2, κ(G) = n(G)−2. By Theorem 4,
κ∗f (G) ≥ n(G)− 3. By Theorem 1, κ∗f (G) < κ(G). Thus, κ∗f (G) = n(G)− 3. 
4. Spanning pipeline-connectivity
Similar to some recentworks on the spanning connectivity [4–10] and the spanning fan-connectivity, studied in Section 2,
we study spanning pipeline-connectivity in this section. Lemma 9 and Theorem 5 are analogous to Lemma 1 and Theorem 1
respectively.
Lemma 9. Every 1∗-connected graph is 1∗p-connected.
Theorem 5. κ∗p (G) ≤ κ∗f (G) ≤ κ∗(G) ≤ κ(G) for any 1∗p-connected graph. Moreover, κ∗p (G) = κ∗f (G) = κ∗(G) = κ(G) if and
only if G is a complete graph.
Theorem 6. Assume that k is a positive integer. Let u and v be two non-adjacent vertices of G. Suppose that dG(u) + dG(v) ≥
n(G)+ k. Then κ∗p (G) ≥ k if and only if κ∗p (G+ (u, v)) ≥ k.
Proof. Obviously, κ∗p (G + (u, v)) ≥ k if κ∗p (G) ≥ k. Suppose that κ∗p (G + (u, v)) ≥ k. Let U = {x1, x2, . . . , xt} and
W = {y1, y2, . . . , yt} be any two subsets of G such that U 6= W and t ≤ k. We need to find a spanning (U,W )-pipeline of G.
Since G+ (u, v) is k∗p-connected, there exists a spanning (U,W )-pipeline of G+ (u, v). Let {P1, P2, . . . , Pt} be a spanning
(U,W )-pipeline with Pi joining xi to ypi(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ t . Without loss of generality, we assume that pi(i) = i. Obviously,
{P1, P2, . . . , Pt} is a spanning (U,W )-pipeline of G if (u, v) is not in P . Thus, we consider the case that (u, v) is in P . By
Lemma 3, we can find a spanning (U,W )-pipeline of G if t = 1. Thus, we consider the case t ≥ 2.
Case 1:U∩W = ∅.Without loss of generality, wemay assume that (u, v) ∈ P1. Thus, we canwrite P1 as 〈x1,H1, u, v,H2, y1〉.
(Note that H1 = 〈x〉 if x = u, and H2 = 〈y〉 if y = v.) Let P ′i be the path obtained from Pi by deleting x and yi. Thus, we can
write Pi as 〈xi, P ′i , yi〉 for 1 ≤ i ≤ t .
Case 1.1: dP1(u)+ dP1(v) ≥ n(P1)+ 1. With Lemma 8, there is a hamiltonian path Q1 of G[P1] joining x1 to y1. We set Qi = Pi
for 2 ≤ i ≤ t . Then {Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qt} forms a spanning (U,W )-pipeline of G. See Fig. 3 for illustration.
Case 1.2: dP1(u)+ dP1(v) ≤ n(P1). We claim that dPi(u)+ dPi(v) ≥ n(Pi)+ 2 for some 2 ≤ i ≤ t .
1348 C.-K. Lin et al. / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 (2009) 1342–1348
δ(G) = m+ k+ 1 for some integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ m− 1, and dG(u)+ dG(v) ≥ 2δ(G) = 2m+ 2k+ 2 for all two distinct
vertices u and v in G. By Theorem 3, κ∗f (G) ≥ 2k+ 1 = 2δ(G)− n(G) and the theorem follows. 
Corollary 2. κ∗p (G) = n(G)− 4 if δ(G) = n(G)− 2 and n(G) ≥ 5.
Proof. By Theorem 8, κ∗p (G) ≥ n(G)−4. Let V (G) = {x1, x2, . . . , xn(G)}. Without loss of generality, we assume that (x1, x2) 6∈
E(G). We set U = {x3, x5, x6, . . . , xn(G)} andW = {x4, x5, x6. . . . , xn(G)}. Obviously, U 6= W and |U| = |W | = n(G)− 3.
Since there is no hamiltonian path of G[V (G)− {x5, x6, . . . , xn(G)}] joining x3 to x4, there is no spanning (U,W )-pipeline
of G. Thus, κ∗p (G) = n(G)− 4. 
5. An example
Weuse the following example to illustrate that κ(G), κ∗(G), κ∗f (G), and κ∗p (G) are really different concepts and, in general,
have different values.
Example 1. Suppose that n is a positive integer with n ≥ 2. Let H(n) be the complete 3-partite graph K2n,2n,n−1 with vertex
partite sets V1 = {x1, x2, . . . , x2n}, V2 = {y1, y2, . . . , y2n}, and V3 = {z1, z2, . . . , zn−1}. Let G(n) be the graph obtained from
H(n) by adding the edge set {(zi, zj) | 1 ≤ i 6= j < n}. Thus, G[V3] is the complete graph Kn−1. Obviously, n(G(n)) = 5n− 1,
δ(G(n)) = 2n+(n−1) = 3n−1, and κ(G(n)) = δ(G(n)). In the following,wewill show that κ∗(G(n)) = n+1, κ∗f (G(n)) = n,
and κ∗p (G(n)) = n− 1.
By Lemma 5, κ∗(G(n)) ≥ 2δ(G(n)) − n(G(n)) + 2 = n + 1. To show κ∗(G(n)) = n + 1, we claim that there is no
(n + 2)∗-container of G(n) between x1 and x2. Suppose this is not the case. Let {P1, P2, . . . , Pn+2} be an (n + 2)∗-container
of G(n) between x1 and x2. Obviously, |V (Pi) ∩ (V1 − {x1, x2})| ≤ |V (Pi) ∩ (V2 ∪ V3)| − 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 2. Thus,∑n+2
i=1 |V (Pi) ∩ (V1 − {x1, x2})| = (
∑n+2
i=1 |(V2 ∪ V3) ∩ V (Pi)|) − (n + 2). Therefore, |V1 − {x, y}| ≤ |V2 ∪ V3| − (n + 2).
However, |V1 − {x, y}| = 2n− 2 but |V2 ∪ V3| − (n+ 2) = 2n− 3. This leads to a contradiction.
By Theorem 4, κ∗f (G(n)) ≥ 2δ(G(n)) − n(G(n)) + 1 = n. To show κ∗f (G(n)) = n, we claim that there is no spanning
(x1,U)-fan of G(n)where U = {y1, y2, . . . , yn+1}. Suppose this is not the case. Let {P1, P2, . . . , Pn+1} be a spanning (x1,U)-
fan of G(n). Without loss of generality, we assume that Pi is a path joining x1 to yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1. Obviously,
|(V1 − {x1}) ∩ V (Pi)| ≤ |((V2 ∪ V3)− {yi}) ∩ V (Pi)|. Thus,∑n+1i=1 |(V1 − {x1}) ∩ V (Pi)| ≤∑n+1i=1 |((V2 ∪ V3)− {yi}) ∩ V (Pi)|.
Therefore, |V1−{x1}| ≤ |(V2∪V3)−U|. However, |V1−{x1}| = 2n−1 but |(V2∪V3)−U| = 2n−2.We get a contradiction.
By Theorem 8, κ∗p (G(n)) ≥ 2δ(G(n))− n(G(n)) = n− 1. To prove κ∗p (G(n)) = n− 1, we claim that there is no spanning
(U,W )-pipeline where U = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} andW = {xn+1, xn+2, . . . , x2n}. Suppose that there exists a spanning (U,W )-
pipeline {P1, P2, . . . , Pn}. Obviously, |V2 ∩ V (Pi)| − 1 ≤ |V3 ∩ V (Pi)| for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then∑ni=1(|V2 ∩ V (Pi)| − 1) ≤∑n
i=1 |V3∩V (Pi)|. Therefore, (
∑n
i=1 |V2∩V (Pi)|)−n ≤
∑n
i=1 |V3∩V (Pi)|. However, (
∑n
i=1 |V2∩V (Pi)|)−n = |V2|−n = n
but
∑n
i=1 |V3 ∩ V (Pi)| = |V3| = n− 1. We get a contradiction.

that every vertex of G is on some path in Ck(u, v). A graph G is k∗-connected if there exists a k∗-container between any two
distinct vertices in G. Obviously, a graph G is 1∗-connected if and only if it is Hamiltonian connected. Moreover, a graph G
is 2∗-connected if it is Hamiltonian. The study of k∗-connected graph is motivated by the 3∗-connected graphs proposed by
Albert et al. [13]. A graph G is superconnected if it is i∗-connected for all 1 ≤ i ≤ κ(G). Some related works have appeared
in [14–16].
In [17], Cao et al. proved that the connectivity of a pyramid network is three. Based on Menger’s Theorem, the 3-
connected property of a pyramid network can be derived. Sarbazi-Azad et al. andWu et al. studied the Hamiltonicity and the
Hamiltonian connectivity of pyramid networks in [10,11]. Thus a pyramid network is 1∗-connected and 2∗-connected. In
this paper, we study the 3∗-connected property of a pyramid network.We prove that any pyramid network is 3∗-connected.
Consequently, a pyramid network is superconnected.
2. The pyramid networks
A mesh network M(m, n) is defined as the Cartesian product Pm × Pn, where Pm and Pn are undirected paths withm and
n vertices, respectively. An n-dimensional pyramid network PM[n] is a hierarchy structure based on mesh networks. The
subgraph induced by all vertices in the i-th layer of a PM[n] is a mesh network M(2i, 2i). The vertex set of an n-dimensional
pyramid network PM[n], V (PM[n]) = {(k; x, y) | 0 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ x ≤ 2k, 1 ≤ y ≤ 2k}. Two vertices (k1; x1, y1) and
(k2; x2, y2) in PM[n] are adjacent if they satisfy one of the following conditions:
1. k1 = k2, x1 = x2, and |y1 − y2| = 1;
2. k1 = k2, y1 = y2, and |x1 − x2| = 1; and
3. k2 = k1 + 1, x1 = ⌊x2/2⌋, and y1 = ⌊y2/2⌋.
Fig. 1 illustrates the pyramid network PM[2].
Some studies on the Hamiltonian connectivity and fault Hamiltonicity of pyramid networks have been proposed in [10,
11]. The results are listed as follows.
Lemma 1 ([10,11]). A pyramid network PM[n] is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 1.
Lemma 2 ([11]). A pyramid network PM[n] is Hamiltonian connected for n ≥ 1.
Lemma 3 ([11]). Let F ⊂ V (PM[n]) ∪ E(PM[n]) with |F | = 1. Then PM[n] − F is Hamiltonian for n ≥ 1.
The following lemmas consider the Hamiltonicity of mesh networks.
Lemma 4 ([18]). A mesh network M(m, n) is Hamiltonian laceable except (1) when m = 2 and n ≠ 2, and (2) when m = 3
and n is an even integer.
Lemma 5. A mesh networkM(m, n) is Hamiltonian for m = n.

Case 4: Suppose that s = (k; x, y) and t ∈ {(n; 1, 1), (n; 1, 2n), (n; 2n, 1), (n; 2n, 2n)} with 1 ≤ k ≤ n− 1. Without loss
of generality, we assume that t = (n; 1, 1). Let t ′ = (n− 1; 1, 1). Consider the following subcases.
Subcase 4.1: Suppose that s ≠ t ′. For the first (n − 1)-layer pyramid network PM[n − 1], we have degPM[n−1](t ′) = 3.
Let t ′1 = (n − 2; 1, 1), t ′2 = (n − 1; 2, 1), and t ′3 = (n − 1; 1, 2) be the three neighbors of t ′ in PM[n − 1]. By
hypothesis, there exists a 3∗-container C3∗(s, t ′) in PM[n − 1]. Thus there exist three disjoint paths P ′1, P ′2, and P ′3, such
that P ′1 joins s to t ′, P
′
2 joins s to t
′
2, and P
′
3 joins s to t
′
3. Let P
′′
2 = ⟨(n − 1; 2, 1), (n; 3, 2), (n; 4, 2), (n; 5, 2)
Q2,2n (n;5,2,2n,1)−→
(n; 2n, 1), (n; 2n − 1, 1), (n; 2n − 2, 1), (n; 2n − 3, 1), . . . , (n; 1, 1)⟩. Let P ′′3 = ⟨(n − 1; 1, 2), (n; 1, 3)
Q4,2n (n;1,3,4,3)−→
(n; 4, 3), (n; 3, 3), (n; 2, 3), (n; 2, 2), (n; 1, 2), (n; 1, 1)⟩. Thus P1 = ⟨s, P ′1, t ′, t⟩, P2 = ⟨s, P ′2, t ′2, P ′′2 , t⟩, and P3 = ⟨s, P ′3,
t ′3, P
′′
3 , t⟩ form the 3∗-container C3∗(s, t) of PM[n].
Subcase 4.2: Suppose that s = t ′. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle HC = ⟨s,HC1, t,HC2, s⟩ in PM[n]−{(s, t)}.
Thus P1 = ⟨s, t⟩, P2 = ⟨s,HC1, t⟩, and P3 = ⟨s,HC2, t⟩ form the 3∗-container C3∗(s, t) of PM[n]. 
We have proved that a pyramid network is 3∗-connected in Theorem 1. By Lemmas 1 and 2, a pyramid network is
2∗-connected and 1∗-connected, respectively. Thus we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1. The pyramid network PM[n] is superconnected for n ≥ 1.

The spanning connectivity of G, κ∗(G), is defined to be the largest integer k such that G
is w∗-connected for all 1 ≤ w ≤ k if G is a 1∗-connected graph and undefined otherwise.
A graph G is super spanning connected if κ∗(G) = κ(G). In this paper, we prove that the
n-dimensional fully connected cubic network FCCNn is super spanning connected.

1. Introduction
As is customary in structure studies of parallel architectures, we focus on a set of
identical processors and view the architectures of the underlying interconnection
networks as graphs. The vertices of a graph represent the processors of the archi-
tecture, and the edges of the graph represent the communication links between the
processors. Network topology is a crucial factor for interconnection networks since it
determines the performance of the networks. Many interconnection network topolo-
gies have been proposed in the literature for the purpose of connecting thousands
of processing elements. The hypercube networks have received much attention over
the past few years because they offer an interconnection network with large band-
width, logarithmic diameter and high degree of fault tolerance. Thus, the hypercube
network has been chosen as the interconnection topology in several commercially
available parallel computers.11 However, the hypercube networks are not truly ex-
pandable because we have to change the hardware configuration of all the vertices
whenever the number of vertices grows exponentially, as the vertices have to be
provided with additional ports. Fortunately, hierarchical interconnection networks
(HINs) provide excellent expandability to meet this need.
For decades, two kinds of HINs were proposed addressing the issue of construct-
ing hierarchical interconnection networks. One is the HINs consisting of exactly
two levels,3,4,8,12,13,15 and another is recursively defined HIN.2,16,18,19 Moreover, the
fully connected cubic networks (FCCNs) proposed in16 are defined recursively by
taking the 3-dimensional cube as the basis graph. It indicates that fully connected
cube networks are a class of newly proposed hierarchical networks for multisystems,
which enjoy the strengths of constant vertex degree and good expandability. Some
interesting properties about FCCNs are discussed in.16 In particular, Yang et al.17
presented the shortest-path routing algorithm, Ho et al.5 find the values of fault-
tolerant hamiltonian connectivity and fault-tolerant hamiltonicity. Super spanning
connectivity is an important issue in the design and the analysis of interconnection
networks.7,9,14 In this paper, we discuss this parameter for FCCNs.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the formal
definition of FCCNs and some preliminaries. In Section 3, we give our main result.
2. Preliminaries
An interconnection network is represented by a graph G = (V,E) with vertices
and edges symbolizing the processors and communication links between processors,
respectively. For the graph definitions and notations we follow.1 G = (V,E) is a

For n ≥ 1, the n-level FCCN , FCCNn, is the graph defined recursively as
follows:
(1) FCCN1 is the graph with V (FCCN1) = Z8 and E(FCCN1) = {(0, 1), (0, 2),
(1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7)}. Obviously, FCCN1
is isomorphic to Q3.
(2) When n ≥ 2, FCCNn is built from eight vertex-disjoint copies of FCCNn−1
by adding 28 edges. For 0 ≤ k ≤ 7, we let kFCCNn−1 denote a copy of FCCNn−1
with each vertex being prefixed with k, then FCCNn is defined by
V (FCCNn) =
7⋃
k=0
V (kFCCNn−1),
E(FCCNn) = (
7⋃
k=0
E(kFCCNn−1)) ∪ {(pq
n−1, qpn−1) | 0 ≤ p < q ≤ 7}.
Let n ≥ 2. A vertex v in FCCNn is a boundary vertex if it is of the form p
n and
v is an intercubic vertex if it is of the form pqn−1 with p 6= q. An intercubic edge is
an edge joining two intercubic vertices.
Figure 1(a), (b), and (c) show FCCN1, FCCN2 and FCCN3. In essence, each
vertex of an FCCN has four links, with each boundary vertex having one I/O
channel link that is not counted in the vertex degree. Obviously, kFCCNn−1 have
7 intercubic vertices and 1 boundary vertex for 0 ≤ k ≤ 7 and n ≥ 2. It is easy
to check that if we shrink each FCCNn−1 in FCCNn to a vertex, we will get a
complete graph K8. We call it the complete property.
In order to discuss the super spanning connectivity of fully connected cubic
networks, we need to introduce the extended fully connected cubic networks. For
every t ∈ Z8, the extended fully connected cubic network FCCN
r,s,t
n is the graph
obtained from FCCNn by joining the vertices in the set {p
n | p ∈ {r, s, t}} to
an extra vertex w. For example, FCCN 1,3,42 is illustrated in Figure 1(d). By the
complete property, we only discuss FCCN 0,1,2n .
The following theorem is proved in.5
Theorem 2.1.
5 FCCNn is hamiltonian and hamiltonian connected for n ≥ 2.
Theorem 2.2. FCCN 0,1,2n is hamiltonian and hamiltonian connected for n ≥ 2.

Lemma 3.1. FCCNn, FCCN
0,1,2
n are 3∗-connected for n ≥ 2.
Proof. We prove the statement by induction. Since FCCN2 has 64 vertices,
FCCN0,1,22 has 65 vertices, we can check that FCCN2, FCCN
0,1,2
2 are 3
∗-connected
by brute force. Our experiments for brute force enumeration indicate that FCCN2,
FCCN0,1,22 are 3
∗-connected.
We assume the statement holds for FCCNl and FCCN
0,1,2
l with 2 ≤ l ≤ n.

Second, we prove that FCCN 0,1,2n+1 is 3

Let u and v be any two distinct vertices in FCCN 0,1,2n+1 . We need to find a 3

container C∗(u, v) of FCCN 0,1,2n+1 joining u to v.
Suppose that u ∈ bFCCNn and v is the extra vertex w. If b ∈ {0, 1, 2},
then without loss of generality, we assume that b = 0. By induction, there exists
a 3∗-container C∗0 (u,w) = {〈u, P01, 00

1. Introduction
In this paper, a network is represented as a loopless undirected graph. For the
graph definition and notation, we follow Bondy and Murty1 and Hsu et al.5
The G = (V,E) is a graph if V is a finite set and E is a subset of {(a, b) |
(a, b) is an unordered pair of V }. We say that V is the vertex set and E is the edge
set. Two vertices u and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E. A graph G = (V0 ∪ V1, E) is
bipartite if V (G) is the union of two disjoint sets V0 and V1 such that every edge joins
a vertex of V0 and a vertex of V1. A path is a sequence of adjacent vertices, written
as 〈v0, v1, . . . , vm〉, in which all the vertices v0, v1, . . . , vm are distinct except possibly
v0 = vm. A path can also be written as 〈v0, P, vm〉, where P = 〈v0, v1, . . . , vm〉, and
we use P−1 to denote the inverse path 〈vm, vm−1, . . . , v0〉. The length of a path P ,
denoted by l(P ), is the number of edges in P . Let u and v be two vertices of G. The
distance between u and v, denoted by dG(u, v), is the length of the shortest path
of G joining u and v. The diameter of G is max{dG(u, v) | u, v ∈ V (G)}. A cycle
is a path with at least three vertices such that the first vertex is the same as the
last one. A hamiltonian cycle is a cycle of length |V (G)|, and a hamiltonian path is
a path of length |V (G)| − 1. A graph is hamiltonian if it has a hamiltonian cycle.
It is easy to check that a hamiltonian bipartite graph G = (V0 ∪ V1, E) satisfies
|V0| = |V1| ≥ 2.
Let u = un−1un−2 . . . u1u0 be an n-bit binary string. We use (u)i to denote ui for
0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. The Hamming weight w(u) of u is |{i | (u)i = 1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}|.
Let u and v be two n-bit binary strings. The Hamming distance h(u,v) between u
and v is the number of different bits in the corresponding strings. The n-dimensional
hypercube, denoted by Qn, consists of all n-bit binary strings as its vertices, and two
vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if h(u,v) = 1. The hypercube is one of the
most popular interconnection networks for parallel computer/communication sys-
tem, see Leighton.9 This is partly due to its attractive properties such as regularity,
recursive structure, vertex and edge symmetry, maximum connectivity, as well as
effective routing and broadcasting algorithm.
It is known that dQn(u,v) = h(u,v). Moreover, Qn is a bipartite graph with
bipartition V0 = {u | w(u) is even} and V1 = {u | w(u) is odd}. A vertex u of
Qn is white if w(u) is even, otherwise u is black. For 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, we use u
k
to denote the vertex v with (v)k = 1 − (u)k and (v)i = (u)i if i 6= k. An edge is
a k-dimensional edge if it joins a vertex u to uk. We use Ek to denote the set of
all k-dimensional edges of Qn. For i = 0, 1, let Q
i
n−1 denote the subgraph of Qn
induced by {u | (u)0 = i}. Obviously, Q
i
n−1 is isomorphic to Qn−1.
Assume that n is any positive integer with n ≥ 2. Let u and x (respectively, v
and y) be two distinct white (respectively, black) vertices of Qn. It has been proven

A hamiltonian laceable graph G = (V0 ∪ V1, E) is hyper-hamiltonian laceable if
for any vertex v ∈ Vi, i = 0, 1, there is a hamiltonian path of G − {v} between any
two vertices of V1−i. A hyper-hamiltonian laceable graph G is k-edge fault-tolerant
hyper-hamiltonian laceable if G − F remains hyper-hamiltonian laceable for every
F ⊂ E(G) with |F | ≤ k.
Lemma 2.2. (Tsai et al.15) Qn is (n − 3)-edge fault-tolerant hyper hamiltonian
laceable if n ≥ 3.
We can discuss the hamiltonian laceability for hypercubes that contain faulty
vertices. However, this problem seems very difficult. It is conjectured that Qn − F
is hamiltonian if F consists of a faulty vertex set FV and a faulty edge set Fe with
|FV ∩V0| = |FV ∩V1| = r and r+ |Fe| ≤ n−2, see Sun et al.
14 Sun et al.14 restricted
the study by assuming that the faulty vertices are only on disjoint adjacent pairs.
Lemma 2.3. (Sun et al.14) Let F be a subset of V (Qn)∪E(Qn) such that F can be
decomposed into two parts Fav and Fe, where Fav is a union of fav disjoint adjacent
pairs of Qn and Fe consists of fe edges. Then Qn − F is hamiltonian laceable if
|F | = fav + fe ≤ n − 2.
Lemma 2.4. (Sun et al.14) Let F be a subset of V (Qn)∪E(Qn) such that F can be
decomposed into two parts Fav and Fe, where Fav is a union of fav disjoint adjacent
pairs of Qn and Fe consists of fe edges. Then Qn −F is hyper hamiltonian laceable
if |F | = fav + fe ≤ n − 3.
Assume that x and y are two different vertices in the n-dimensional hypercube.
Saad and Shultz13 constructed n internally disjoint paths joining x and y by the
following manner: Let {αi}
h(x,y)−1
i=0 be the increasing sequence of indices such that
(x)αi 6= (y)αi , and let {αj}
n−1
j=h(x,y) be the increasing sequence of indices such that
(x)αj = (y)αj . For 0 ≤ i ≤ h(x,y) − 1, we set Pi = 〈zi,0 = x, zi,1 = z
α0+i
i,0 ,
zi,2 = z

i,1 , . . . , zi,h(x,y) = z
αh(x,y)−1+i
i,h(x,y)−1 = y〉 with the addition of superscripts per-
formed under modulo h(x,y). For h(x,y) ≤ j ≤ n − 1, we set Pj = 〈x, x

Then P1 = 〈00000, 00010, 00110, 01110〉, P2 = 〈00000, 00100, 01100, 01110〉, P3 =
〈00000, 01000, 01010, 01110〉, P4 = 〈00000, 00001, 00011, 00111, 01111, 01110〉, and
P5 = 〈00000, 10000, 10010, 10110, 11110, 01110〉.
Theorem 2.1. (Saad and Shultz13) Let x and y be two different vertices of Qn.
Then there exist n internally disjoint paths P0, P1, . . . , Pn−1 of Qn joining x to y,
where l(Pi) = h(x,y) if 0 ≤ i ≤ h(x,y) − 1 and l(Pi) = h(x,y) + 2 if h(x,y) ≤ i ≤
n − 1. Furthermore, each Pi, 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, uses exactly one j-dimensional edge if
(x)j 6= (y)j .
Lemma 2.5. Suppose that n ≥ 4. Let x and y be two different vertices of Qn, and
let F be a subset of E(Qn) with |F | ≤ n − 4. Then dQn−F (x,y) is either h(x,y)

1} − {j, k, 0}}. Then A ∪ B forms a set of 2n − 6 edge-disjoint paths of length 3.
Since n ≥ 5, (2n − 6) − |F | ≥ 3. There exists one path T
′
in A ∪ B not passing u
nor v. Suppose that T
′
is of the form 〈x,xt, (xt)i,xi〉. Then 〈x,xt, (xt)i,xi,yj ,y〉 is
a path T in Qn − F such that l(T ) = 5 and {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅. Suppose that T
′
is of the form 〈yj , (yt)j ,yt,y〉. Then 〈x,xi,yj , (yt)j ,yt,y〉 is a path T in Qn − F
such that l(T ) = 5 and {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅. Thus, there exists a path T in Qn − F
joining x to y such that l(T ) = 5 and {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅ that contains exactly one
0-dimensional edge.
Case 4: h(x, y) > 3. Without loss of generality, we can assume that y =
((((x0)1)2)...)h(x,y)−1. By Theorem 2.1, l(Pi) = h(x,y) if i < h(x,y) and l(Pi) =
h(x,y) + 2 otherwise. Since |F | ≤ n − 4, at least one of Pr is in Qn − F − {u,v}.
Suppose that r ≥ h(x,y). Obviously, Pr is a path of length h(x,y)+2 joining x to y
not passing u nor v that contains exactly one 0-dimensional edge. Thus, we assume
that r < h(x,y). Thus, Pr can be written as 〈x,x
i, (xi)j , P
′
i , (y
p)q,yp,y〉 where
{i, j, p, q} are four distinct element of {0, 1, . . . , h(x,y)}. Let A = {〈x,xt, (xt)i,xi〉 |
t ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1} − {i, j, 0}} and B = {〈yp, (yt)p,yt,y〉 | t ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , n −
1}−{p, q, 0}}. Then A∪B forms a set of 2n−6 edge-disjoint paths of length 3, and
there exists one path T
′
in A∪B not passing u nor v. Suppose that T
′
is of the form
〈x,xt, (xt)i,xi〉. Then 〈x,xt, (xt)i,xi, (xi)j, P
′
i , (y
p)q,yp,y〉 is a path T in Qn − F
such that l(T ) = h(x,y) + 2 and {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅. Suppose that T
′
is of the form
〈yp, (yt)p,yt,y〉. Then 〈x,xi, (xi)j , P
′
i , (y
p)q,yp, (yt)p,yt,y〉 is a path T in Qn − F
such that l(T ) = h(x,y) + 2 and {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅. Thus, there exists a path T
in Qn − F joining x to y such that l(T ) = h(x,y) + 2 and {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅ that
contains exactly one 0-dimensional edge.
From the above proof, there exists a shortest path P of Qn − F joining x to y
such that {u,v} ∩ V (P ) = ∅ and |E(P ) ∩ E0| = 1. 
For a vertex w, let the set of its neighbors in graph G be denoted by NbdG(w).
For some neighbor vertex wi of w in Q0n−1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, we define its reduced
edge set REw(w
i) as {(wi, (wi)0)} ∪ {((wi)0, ((wi)0)j) | 1 ≤ j ≤ n− 1 with i 6= j}.
Then we have the following obvious lemma.
Lemma 2.7. REw(w
i)∩REw(w
k) = ∅ if i 6= k. Moreover, 〈(wi)0, ((wi)0)k, (wk)0〉
is a path in Qn − F , and {(w
i, (wi)0), (wk, (wk)0)} ∩ F = ∅ if REw(w
i) ∩ F = ∅
and REw(w
k) ∩ F = ∅.
3. Two disjoint spanning paths
Theorem 3.1. Assume that n is a positive integer with n ≥ 4 and F is a subset
of E(Qn) with |F | ≤ n − 4. Let u and x be two distinct white vertices of Qn and
let v and y be two distinct black vertices of Qn. Let l1 and l2 be odd integers with
l1 ≥ dQn−F (u,v), l2 ≥ dQn−F (x,y), and l1 + l2 = 2
n − 2. Moreover, let l3 and l4
be even integers with l3 ≥ dQn−F (u,x), l4 ≥ dQn−F (v,y), and l3 + l4 = 2
n − 2.
There are two disjoint paths P1 and P2 such that (1) P1 is a path joining u to v

n−1 − F1
joining x to y. Obviously, P1 and P2 are the required paths. See Figure 1(b) for
illustration.
Case 2: {x,y} ⊂ V (Q0n−1) and v ∈ V (Q

p ∈ NbdQ0n−1−F0(u) − {y} such that (p,p

Suppose that l2 < 2

S2 such that (1) S1 is a path joining u to p with l(S1) = 2

Lemma 2.1, there exists a hamiltonian path R of Q1n−1 − F1 joining p

set P1 as 〈u, S1,p,p

paths. See Figure 2(a) for illustration.

R1 is a path joining p

The theorem is proved. 
4. Applications
Lai and Hsu7 began the study of two equal disjoint path cover for an interconnection
network. Let G be a graph with four vertices u, v, x, and y. We say G is (u, v, x, y)-
two-equal-disjoint path coverable if there are two spanning disjoint paths P and Q
such that P is a path joining u to v, Q is a path joining x to y, and l(P ) = l(Q).
With Theorem 3.1, Qn −F for any F ⊂ E(Qn) with |F | ≤ n− 4 is (u,v,x,y)-two-
equal-disjoint path coverable if (1) u and v are white vertices whereas x and y are
black vertices or (2) u and x are white vertices whereas v and y are black vertices.
The path embedding problem, which deals with all possible length of the paths
between given two vertices in a given graph, is investigated in a lot of interconnection
networks, see Chang et al.,2 Fan et al.,3,4 and Ma and Xu.12 In particular, Li et al.10
proved that Qn is bipanconnected. A bipartite graph G is bipanconnected if there
exists a path Pl(x, y) of length l joining any two different vertices x and y with
dG(x, y) ≤ l ≤ |V (G)| − 1 such that 2 | (l − dG(x, y)). Later, we prove that Qn − F
remains bipanconnected for any F ⊂ E(Qn) with |F | ≤ n − 4. Yet, we expect such
path Pl(x,y) can be further extended by including the vertices not in Pl(x,y) into
a hamiltonian path from x to a fixed vertex z or a hamiltonian cycle.
Theorem 4.1. Assume that n is any positive integer with n ≥ 2 and F is a subset
of E(Qn) with |F | ≤ n − 4. Let x and z be two vertices from different partite
sets of Qn and y be a vertex of Qn that is not in {x, z}. For any integer l with
dQn−F (x,y) ≤ l ≤ 2
n − 1 − dQn−F (y, z) and 2 | (l − dQn−F (x,y)), there exists
a hamiltonian path R(x,y, z; l) of Qn−F from x to z such that dR(x,y,z;l)(x,y) = l.
Proof. By brute force, we can check the theorem holds for n = 2, 3. Now, we consider
n ≥ 4. Without loss of generality, we assume that x is a white vertex and z is a black
vertex.
Suppose that y is a black vertex. Obviously, dQn−F (y, z) ≥ 2. There exists
a neighbor w of y such that w 6= x and dQn−F (w, z) = dQn−F (y, z)− 1. Obviously,
w is a white vertex. By Theorem 3.1, there exist two disjoint paths R1 and R2 such
that (1) R1 is a path joining x to y with l(R1) = l, (2) R2 is a path joining w to z
with l(R2) = 2
n−l−2, and (3) R1∪R2 spans Qn−F . We set R as 〈x, R1,y,w, R2, z〉.

Appendix A: Proof of Cases 5–8 in Theorem 3.1
Case 5: y ∈ V (Q0n−1) and {x,v} ⊂ V (Q
1
n−1). By Lemma 2.6, there exists a shortest
path T of Qn − F joining x to y such that {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅. Moreover, l(T ) is
either h(x,y) or h(x,y) + 2 and |E(T ) ∩ E0| = 1. Thus, T can be written as
〈y, T1, z, z
0, T2,x〉 such that (z, z
0) is the only 0-dimensional edge. (Note that y = z
if l(T1) = 0 and z
0 = x if l(T2) = 0.)
(i) l(T1) 6= 0 and l(T2) = 0. Obviously, z is a black vertex. Since |F | ≤
n − 4, there exists a vertex p in V (Q0n−1) − {v
0} such that (p,p0) /∈ F and
dQ0n−1−F0−{y,z}(p,u) = 2.
Suppose that l2 < 2

S2 such that (1) S1 is a path joining u to p with l(S1) = 2

a path joining z to y with l(S2) = l2 − 1, and (3) S1 ∪ S2 spans Q
0
n−1 − F0. By
Lemma 2.2, there exists a hamiltonian path R of (Q1n−1−F1)−{x} joining p
0 to v.
We set P1 as 〈u, S1,p,p
0, R,v〉 and set P2 as 〈x = z

Now we consider l2 ≤ h(x,y) + 2. Thus, l2 ≤ n + 2. By Lemma 2.6, there
exists a shortest path T of Qn − F joining x to y such that {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅.
Moreover, |E(T )∩E0| = 1 and l(T ) ∈ {h(x,y), h(x,y)+ 2}. Thus T can be written

that (1) R1 is a path joining r
0 to s0 with l(R1) = 2
n−1 − l2 + l(T1) − 1, (2) R2 is
a path joining x to z0 with l(R2) = l2 − l(T1)− 1, and (3) R1 ∪R2 spans Q
1
n−1 −F .
We set P1 as 〈u, S1, r, r
0, R1, s
0, s, (S2)
−1,v〉 and set P2 as 〈x, R2, z
0, z, (T1)
−1,y〉.
Obviously, P1 and P2 are the required paths. See Figure 6(e) for illustration.
Suppose that
l(T1)
2 + |F
′
0| > n − 4. We claim that {(wl(T1)−1,w
0
l(T1)−1
), (w0
l(T1)−1
, z0)} ∩ F 6= ∅.
If not, then 〈y = w0, w1, . . . ,wl(T1)−1, w
0
l(T1)−1
, z0, Q2,x〉 is a shortest path of
Qn − F joining y to x such that the only 0-dimensional edge joins a white vertex
wl(T1)−1 in Q
0
n−1 to a black vertex w
0
l(T1)−1
in Q1n−1, contradicting the choice of z.
Obviously, z1 = (z0)
k. We claim that {(z, zk), (zk, z1)} ∩ F 6= ∅. If not, then
similarly 〈y, T1, z, (z)
k , z1, T
′
2,x〉 is a shortest path of Qn − F joining y to x such
that the only 0-dimensional edge joining a white vertex (z)k in Q0n−1 to a black
vertex z1 in Q
1
n−1, contradicting the choice of z.
Let F ∗0 = F0 ∪ {(z, z
i) | zi 6= v, REz(z
i) ∩ F 6= ∅}. Obviously, |F ∗0 | ≤ n − 5 and
(z, zk) ∈ F ∗0 . By induction, there exist two disjoint paths S1 and S2 such that (1)
S1 is a path joining u to v with l(S1) = 2
n−1 − l(T1) − 1, (2) S2 is a path joining
wl(T1)−1 to y with l(S2) = l(T1)− 1, and (3) S1 ∪S2 spans Q
0
n−1 −F
∗
0 . Since z can’t
be on S2, the path S1 can be written as 〈u, S
1
1 , z
i, z, zj , S21 ,v〉 such that k /∈ {i, j}.
In Q1n−1 − F1 we have the path Z = 〈z
0 = z0, z1, . . . , zl2−l(T1)−1 = x〉 where
l2 − l(T1) − 1 is an even integer. Note that l(T1) + (l2 − l(T1) − 1) = l2 − 1 ≤ n + 1
and |F ′0| + |F1| ≤ n − 4. Since
l(T1)
2 + |F

0| > n − 4,
l2−l(T1)−1
2 + |F1| < b
n+1
2 c.
We set Fav as {{z
0, (zi)0} ∪ {(zj)0, ((zi)0)j}} ∪ {{z2i−1, z2i} | 1 ≤ i ≤
l2−l(T1)−1
2 }.
Obviously, |F1| + |Fav | ≤ b
n+1
2 c − 1 + 2 ≤ (n − 3) for n ≥ 8. Consider first the
case when n ≥ 8. Obviously, there exists an edge (r, s) in S11 or S
2
1 such that
{r0, s0} ∩ ({(zi)0, (zj)0, ((zi)0)j}} ∪ {{zi | 0 ≤ i ≤ l2 − l(T1) − 1}) = ∅. Without
loss of generality, (r, s) is in S21 and S
2
1 can be written as 〈z
j , S2,11 , r, s, S
2,2
1 ,v〉. By
Lemma 2.3, there exists a hamiltonian path R of Q1n−1−F1−Fav joining r
0 to s0. We
set P1 as 〈u, S
1
1 , z
i, (zi)0, ((zi)0)j , (zj)0, zj , S2,11 , r, r
0, R, s0, s, S2,21 ,v〉 and set P2 as
〈x, (Z)−1, z0, z, T1,y〉. Obviously, P1 and P2 are the required paths. See Figure 6(f)
for illustration.
Finally, consider when n < 8. If l2 = 3, we can do what we did in subcase (i),
so we can assume l2 ≥ 5. We will show that we can always choose T such that z
is a white vertex. Let n = 5, thus |F | = 1. Then h(y,x) = 3 or h(y,x) = 5. In
either case, consider the four paths of length 2 starting from y, going to a neighbor
in Q0n−1, then using the 0-dimensional edge to Q
1
n−1. These are all edge-disjoint, so
only one of these paths can have an edge of F , and only one of them can contain u,
while none can contain v, since it is a black vertex in Q0n−1. Let 〈y, z, z
0〉 be one of
the remaining paths. Since there is no fault in Q1n−1, and u and v are both in Q
0
n−1,
we can easily extend this path to a shortest path T of Qn − F joining y to x such
that {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅. The cases n = 6 and n = 7 can be handled similarly.
(iii) l(T2) = 0.

88 C.-K. Lin et al.
{u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅ and l(T ) = l2. Suppose that h(z
0,y) > 1. By Theorem 2.1, there
exists (n − 4) internally disjoint paths of Q1n−1 joining z
0 to y such that each path
is of length h(z0,y). Since |F1| ≤ n− 4, there exists a path T
′′ of Q1n−1 −F1 joining
z
0 to y such that v /∈ V (T ′′) and l(T ′′) = h(z0,y). We reset T as 〈x, z, z0, T ′′,y〉.
Obviously, T is a path of Qn − F joining x to y such that {u,v} ∩ V (T ) = ∅ and
l(T ) = l2.
Since |F | ≤ n − 4, there exists a vertex p0 in NbdQ1n−1(v) − {z
0} such that
(p,p0) /∈ F . By induction, there exist two disjoint paths S1 and S2 such that (1) S1
is a path joining u to p with l(S1) = 2
n−1 − 3, (2) S2 is a path joining x to z with
l(S2) = 1, and (3) S1 ∪ S2 spans Q
0
n−1 − F0. Again, there exist two disjoint paths
R1 and R2 such that (1) R1 is a path joining p
0 to v with l(R1) = 2
n−1 − l2, (2) R2
is a path joining z0 to y with l(R2) = l2 − 2, and (3) R1 ∪R2 spans Q
1
n−1 − F1. We
set P1 as 〈u, S1,p,p
0, R1,v〉 and set P2 as 〈x, S2, z, z
0, R2,y〉. Obviously, P1 and P2
are the required paths. See Figure 7(a) for illustration.

Next, we consider l2 = h(x,y) with l2 ≤ n− 3. In this case, there exists a short-
est path T of length of l2 in Qn − F joining x to y. Thus, T can be written as
〈x, T1, z, z
0, T2,y〉 such that (z, z
0) is the only 0-dimensional edge. (Note that x = z
if l(T1) = 0 and z
0 = y if l(T2) = 0.)
Suppose that there exists a shortest path T of Qn − F joining x to y such that
the only 0-dimensional edge (z, z0) joins a black vertex z to a white vertex z0. Since
|F | ≤ n−4, there exists a vertex p0 in NbdQ1n−1(v)−{z
0} such that (p,p0) /∈ F . By
November 3, 2010 16:14
90 C.-K. Lin et al.
(iii) l(T1) ≥ 4. Thus, T1 can be written as 〈x, s, T
′
1,q, z〉 and T2 can be written
as 〈z0 = w0,w1, . . . ,w2r = y〉 for some positive integer r ≤ b
n−8
2 c. Obviously,
w1 = (w0)
k for some index k. Suppose that {(q,q0), (q0,w1)} ∩ F = ∅. Obviously,
〈x, s, T ′1,q,q
0,w1, . . . ,w2r = y〉 is a shortest path of Qn−F joining x to y such that
the only 0-dimensional edge joining a black vertex q in Q0n−1 to a white vertex q
0
in Q1n−1, so we get a contradiction. Thus, {(q,q
0), (q0,w1)} ∩ F 6= ∅. Suppose that
{(z, zk), (zk ,w1)} ∩ F = ∅. Obviously, 〈x,q, z, (z)
k ,w1, . . . ,w2r = y〉 is a shortest
path of Qn −F joining x to y such that the only 0-dimensional edge joining a black
vertex (z)k in Q0n−1 to a white vertex w1 in Q
1
n−1, so we get a contradiction. Thus,
{(z, zk), (zk ,w1)} ∩ F 6= ∅. Let F

0 = F0 ∪ {(z, z
i) | zi 6= q, REz(z
i) ∩ F 6= ∅}.
Obviously, |F ∗0 | ≤ n − 5 and (z, z
k) ∈ F ∗0 . Let p be a vertex in NbdQ0n−1(x) − {q}
such that (p,p0) /∈ F . By induction, there exist two disjoint paths S1 and S2 such
that (1) S1 is a path joining u to p with l(S1) = 2

x to q with l(S2) = l(T1)−2, and (3) S1∪S2 spans Q

Suppose that l(T1) = 0. By Lemma 2.2, there exist a hamiltonian path S of

In this paper, we are interested in the spanning connectivity of line graphs. The line graphs are defined on multigraphs.
A multigraph is a graph with multiedges. LetM be a multigraph. The line graph L(M) ofM is the graph with all the edges of
M as its vertex set and two vertices e and f are adjacent in L(M) if and only if e and f share at least one common vertex inM .
A disconnecting set of edges in a multigraph M is a set F ⊆ E(M) such that M − F has more than one component.
A multigraph graph is k-edge-connected if every disconnecting set has at least k edges. The edge-connectivity of M , written
κ ′(M), is theminimum size of a disconnecting set. In otherwords, κ ′(M) is themaximum k such thatM is k-edge-connected.
Obviously, κ ′(M) ≤ δ(M).
There are some studies on the Hamiltonian property and the Hamiltonian connected property for line graphs [8–12].
Thomassen conjectured that every 4-connected line graph is Hamiltonian [13]. By Ryjác˘ek [14], this conjecture is equivalent
to the conjecture of Matthews and Sumner stating that every 4-connected claw free graph is Hamiltonian [15]. Some
sufficient conditions for a line graph G = L(M) to be Hamiltonian connected are proposed as follow: κ ′(M) ≥ 4 [11],
κ(G) ≥ 7 [12], and M is K1,3-free with κ(G) ≥ 4 [8]. In this paper, we generalize the result in [11] by proving G = L(M) is
k∗-connected if κ ′(M) ≥ 2k ≥ 4. We also generalize our result into spanning fan-connectivity.
2. Preliminaries
AmultigraphM is Eulerian if it has a closed trail that traverses all edges ofM . A subgraphN ofM is dominating inM if every
edge of M has at least one vertex on N . Harary [16] observed that we can delete some edges of the pseudo trail of M that
corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle of L(M) to obtain a closed trail ofM . Moreover, such a closed trail induces a dominating
Eulerian subgraphM ′ ofM . In other words, a Hamiltonian cycle of L(M) can be obtained by merging all the edges ofM −M ′
into the Euler trail ofM ′. Thus, the following theorem is obtained.
Theorem 2.1. Let M be a multigraph with |E(M)| ≥ 3. Then L(M) is Hamiltonian if and only if M has a dominating Eulerian
subgraph.
A k-edge-container of M between two edges e and f is a set of k internal edge-disjoint trails between e and f . Using the
idea behind Theorem 2.1, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 2.2. Assume that G = L(M) for some multigraph M and k is an integer with k ≥ 2. Let e and f be two different edges
of M such that there are no common endvertices between e and f . Then G has a k∗-container C(e, f ) between e and f if M has a
dominating k-edge-container between e and f .
Proof. Suppose that M has a dominating k-edge-container between e and f . Then there exist k internal disjoint trails
P1, P2, . . . , Pk of M such that any edge of M − ∪ki=1 Pi is incident at some vertex in ∪ki=1 Pi. Thus, we can merge all edges
of M − ∪ki=1 Pi into P1, P2, . . . , Pk to obtain k internal disjoint pseudo trails P ′1, P ′2, . . . , P ′k of M . Obviously, {P ′1, P ′2, . . . , P ′k}
forms a k∗-container between e and f in G. 
Let τ(M) denote themaximumnumber of edge-disjoint spanning trees inmultigraphM . The following theoremwas first
introduced by a survey paper [17] with a reference later on [22,18]. However, the formal proof is given in [19].
Theorem 2.3. Assume that M is a connectedmultigraph and k is a positive integer. Then κ ′(M) ≥ 2k if and only if τ(M−X) ≥ k
for any X ⊂ E(M) with |X | ≤ k.
3. Spanning connectivity
Lemma 3.1. Let M be a multigraph with τ(M) ≥ k ≥ 2. For any two vertices x1 and x2 of M, there exists a spanning subgraph
H of M that satisfies
1. κ ′(H) ≥ k− 1,
2. degH(x) is even for all x ∈ V (M)− {x1, x2}, and
3. degH(xi)− k is even for i = 1, 2.
Proof. Let {T1, T2, . . . , Tk} be a set of edge-disjoint spanning trees ofM . Let S be the subgraph ofM generated by∪k−1i=1 E(Ti).
Obviously, κ ′(S) ≥ k − 1. Let X = {x | degS(x) is odd and x ∈ V (M) − {x1, x2}} ∪ {xi | i ∈ {1, 2} and degS(xi) − k is odd}.
Obviously, |X | is even. Let X = {u1, u2, . . . , u2l}. Let Pi be the unique path in Tk joining u2i−1 to u2i. Let H be the subgraph of
M generated by E(S)⊕ E(P1)⊕ E(P2)⊕ · · · ⊕ E(Pl)where⊕ is the set symmetric difference operation. It is easy to see that
H is the required subgraph. 
A k-edge-container ofM between two vertices x and y is a set of k edge-disjoint trails between x and y.
Theorem 3.1. Let M be a multigraph with τ(M) ≥ k ≥ 2. Then there exists a spanning k-edge-container between any two
vertices x1 and x2 of M.
Proof. By Lemma 3.1, there exists a spanning subgraph H ofM that satisfies
1. κ ′(H) ≥ k− 1,
2. degH(x) is even for all x ∈ V (M)− {x1, x2}, and
3. degH(xi)− k is even for i = 1, 2.
P.-Y. Huang, L.-H. Hsu / Applied Mathematics Letters 24 (2011) 1614–1617 1617
1. τ(H) ≥ k− 1,
2. degH(x) is even for all x ∈ V (M)− R, and
3. degH(x) is odd for all x ∈ R.
Since τ(H) ≥ k − 1, there exists (k − 1) edge-disjoint trails ∪r−1i=1 {Qij | 1 ≤ j ≤ ni} ∪ {Qrj | 1 ≤ j ≤ nr − 1} where Qij
is a trail joining x to yi. Let K be the subgraph H − ∪E(Qij). Obviously, degK (x) and degK (yr) are odd and degK (u) is even
for any u ∈ V (M) − {x, yr}. Thus, x and yr are in the same component of K . Hence, there is a trail Qrnr of K joining x to yr .
Let T be the subgraph ofM generated by the edge set E(K)− E(Qk). Obviously, degT (u) is even for any vertex of u ∈ V (M).
Thus, T can be decomposed into a set of cycles. Since H is connected, we can merge these cycles, one by one, with some
trails in {Qij | 1 ≤ i ≤ r and 1 ≤ j ≤ ni} to obtain a set of trails {Pij | 1 ≤ i ≤ r and 1 ≤ j ≤ ni} of M . Obviously,{Pij | 1 ≤ i ≤ r and 1 ≤ j ≤ ni} satisfies the condition. 
Theorem 4.3. L(M) is k∗-fan-connected if M is a multigraph with κ ′(M) ≥ 2k ≥ 4. Thus, κ∗f (L(M)) ≥ k if κ ′(M) ≥ 2k ≥ 4.
Proof. Assume that U = {f1, f2, . . . , fk} ⊂ E(M) and e ∈ E(M) − U . Let e = (u, v) and vi be an endvertex of fi such that
vi ≠ u for all i. LetM ′ = M − U . By Theorem 2.3, τ(M ′) ≥ k. From Lemma 4.1,M ′ is (k− 1)-collapsible. With Theorem 4.2,
M ′ has k edge-disjoint spanning trails P1, P2, . . . , Pk such that Pi is a trail joining u to vi.
Case 1. e ∉ ∪kj=1 E(Pj). We set Qi as ⟨e, Pi, fi⟩ for every i. Obviously, {Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qk} forms a spanning k-(e,U)-edge-fan.
Case 2. e ∈ ∪kj=1 E(Pj). Without loss of generality, we assume that e ∈ E(P1). Depending on whether the occurrence of e is of
(u, v) or (v, u) in P1, we have the following two cases.
Subcase 2.1. P1 can be written as ⟨u, J1, v, e, u, J2, v1⟩. We set Q1 as ⟨e, v, J−11 , u, J2, v1, f1⟩ and Qi = ⟨e, Pi, fi⟩ for 2 ≤ i ≤ k.
Subcase 2.2. P1 can be written as ⟨u, J1, u, e, v, J2, v1⟩. We set Q1 = ⟨e, v, J2, v1, f1⟩, Q2 = ⟨e, u, J1, P2, f2⟩, and Qi = ⟨e, Pi, fi⟩
for 3 ≤ i ≤ k.
Obviously, {Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qk} forms a spanning k-(e,U)-edge-fan. By Theorem 4.1, L(M) has a spanning k-(e,U)-fan
Fk(e,U). 
Since κ∗f (G) ≤ κ∗(G) if G is 1∗-connected, Theorem 3.2 is a consequence of Theorem 4.3. However, we still present
Theorem 3.2 first to improve the readability of this paper.
