I. 研究目標
In wireless links, local oscillator instabilities, transmitter/receiver mobility, and various other
factors induce time-varying carrier phase rotations. When the carrier phase cannot be tracked,
then the channel can be modeled as noncoherent additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel
[1]. The associated signal and code designs have received significant attention [2]-[6]. For signal
vectors using M-ary phase-shift keying (M-PSK) symbols, the maximum-likelihood (ML) based
noncoherent distance defined in [1] plays an important role in constructing block codes in [1]
and [2]. For signal vectors considering amplitude/phase modulation (APM) symbols, a spectral-
efficient differential APM scheme was studied in [7], where the authors derived a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector and the corresponding distance measure. From a different
perspective, the noncoherent modulation schemes devised in [2]-[7] can also be regarded as the
inner modulation codes, and powerful channel codes, such as Turbo and low-density parity-check
(LDPC) algorithms, are used as the outer channel codes. In this report, we call this concatenated
approach a noncoherent coded scheme, where several of them can be found in [8]-[10].
However, in addition to the phase rotations, the amplitude of the channel coefficients also
suffers from attenuation due to the fading effect. The noncoherent block fading channel, in
which both the amplitude and the phase variations change independently from block to block,
is a widely-used model. For M-PSK signal vectors, the pair-wise error probability (PEP), as
well as the distance measure, can be obtained from [11]. For APM signal vectors, in [12], the
closed-form PEP using a GLRT detector was investigated for slow time-varying Rayleigh fading
channels. The GLRT detector does not require the knowledge of the channel statistics, and is
robust to different channel statistics [12]. In contrast, if the channel statistics are available, an

43) A coded differential APM scheme is constructed using a codeword-interleaving strategy.
At the transmitter, the design criteria for the bit labelling and the codeword interleaving
rules are investigated. At the receiver, not only the iterative noncoherent detection and
decoding algorithm between the channel decoder and the detector is executed, but also
the extrinsic information is exchanged between adjacent codewords.
4) Compared to the scheme described in [15], the constructed noncoherent coded schemes
are capable of providing a significant improvement, either in the error-floor or the
waterfall region.

A. 非同調區塊衰退通道
Let X denote the set of all the L possible length-T transmit signal vectors x, and ρ represent
the averaged SNR factor. The power constraint of the transmitted signal vector is given by
E[‖x‖2] = T , x ∈ X . If we let n, which has CN (0, 1) distributed entries, denote a length-T
noise vector, then the length-T receive signal vector y can be written as y =
√
ρhx+n, where
the channel coefficient h = Ahejθh , which is unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver,
is a CN (0, 1) distributed random variable. As a result, the amplitude of h, i.e., Ah, is Rayleigh
distributed, and the phase of h, i.e., θh, is uniformly distributed over [0, 2π]. Ah and θh are
independent of each other. h is assumed to be constant within one coherence interval (block),
and changes independently from block to block. Let Λ ≡ IT +ρxx† denote the T×T covariance
matrix of y. The channel is memoryless and specified by its transition probability [11]

Example of Differential Encoding Rules for 16-APSK and 16-QAM Signals: Let (b0, b1, b2, b3)
denote the data bits carried between two adjacent symbols xt and xt+1, where bi ∈ {0, 1} for
i = 0, 1, 2, 3. For differential 16-APSK, which is illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the first labelling bit
b0 controls the change in amplitude between xt and xt+1, while the last three bits (b1, b2, b3)
decide the phase rotation, which can be represented by a mapping rule ξp(b1, b2, b3), in the given
PSK ring. For example, when the Ungerboeck mapping rule is considered, the mapping rule
ξp(b1, b2, b3) = b1 + 2b2 + 4b3. If we let η = AO/AI denote the ratio of the radii for the two
PSK rings shown in Fig. 1(a), the differential encoding rules can be mathematically written as
xt+1 = xte
j 2π

ξp(b1,b2,b3)ηb0κ, where κ = AO+AI−2At
AO−AI .
For differential 16-QAM, the entire signal constellation can be divided into four PSK rings
based on the quadrants. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the four signal points in the first
quadrant form a PSK ring with the center point (+u,+u). The four center points corresponding
to the four PSK rings also form a PSK ring with a radius of
√
2u. The first two labelling bits
(b0, b1) decide the quadrant of xt+1, while the last two bits (b2, b3) decide the relative position
of xt+1 to the center point of the associated PSK ring. Firstly, if we let ξu(b0, b1) represent the
mapping rule from the data bits (b0, b1) to the phase shift between the center points Ut and Ut+1,
where Ui = sgn[Re(xi)] · u + jsgn[Im(xi)] · u, and j =

of the theoretical PEP curves is verified through the simulated PEP curves (Curves A and D).
Moreover, it is also shown that the PEP curves based on high-SNR approximation are close to
the actual PEP curves in the high-SNR region for both cases. 
It is notable that in addition to Example 1, Theorems 1 and 2 can also be applied to other
cases using arbitrary noncoherent signal sets. Fig. 3 shows the word error rate (WER) of the
considered differential 16-QAM and 16-APSK signals, where T = 5. In Curves B and D, the
WER performance is estimated by averaging the summation of the high-SNR approximated PEP
values from their nearest neighbors for each possible transmitted signal vector.

‖x‖‖y‖ and ζ is regarded as the angle between x and y. The GLRT detector is
intended to calculate the projection of y onto S, where S denotes the one-dimensional space
spanned by x. For two possible transmit signal vectors xa and xb where Pa < Pb, let Sa (Sb)
denote the one-dimensional space spanned by xa (xb), and ζa (ζb) denote the angle between y
and xa (xb). For a specific receive signal vector y˜ given in Fig. 4(a), ‖y˜‖ cos ζa = |y˜†xa|√Pa =

= ‖y˜‖ cos ζb and, thus, the projections of y˜ onto Sa and Sb are the same. In other words,
ζa = ζb and the decision boundary lies in the middle of the angle between xa and xb.

Fig. 5 depicts the transceiver of a noncoherent coded scheme. At the transmitter, a codeword
c is interleaved and divided into several bit vectors, which are used to label multiple differential
APM signal vectors. As a demonstration, we consider an (nc, kc) convolutional code.

L = |X | = 2TRm and Rm denotes the modulation rate considering a single coherence block,
 is called the index of x() in X . We further let ξ(, k) denote the function which yields the
index of the signal point in X whose labelling bits differ only in the k-th position to those of
x(). In this subsection, we derive Criteria 1 and 2 using an analysis procedure similar to that

define the corresponding two sequences as x = [x1,x2, · · · ,xd] and xˆ = [xˆ1, xˆ2, · · · , xˆd], where
all xi, xˆi ∈ X and xi 	= xˆi for i = 1, 2, · · · , d. It is notable that x is only part of the entire
transmitted sequence. Let yi denote the receive signal block corresponding to xi. Then we have

However, it is difficult to obtain a closed form for (10) by following derivations similar to
those given in Appendix A. In [11] and [20], for the case using a unitary space-time signal
constellation, a Chernoff upper bound was used to obtain a simpler expression. However, since
the signal vectors considered in this project have non-uniform powers, this simplification is no
longer applicable. Hence, in order to obtain the design metric, we first estimate the average error
probability of each different bit in the error event, and then apply the calculation method of the
event-error probability in the binary symmetric channel [21]. Under the assumption that perfect
a priori information of the labelling bits is available at the detector, when considering a code bit
in an error event, which is interleaved to the k-th position of the labelling bits for a coherence
block, the error occurs only in the condition where the labelling bits of xi and xˆi differ only in
the k-th bit position [20][22][23]. We thus define Δ(0,X , ξ) as the averaged error probability
with a single bit error, conditioned on the fact that x(0) is transmitted.

ulated from the all-zero codeword c(0), xi(0) = x(0) for i = 0, 1, · · · , d− 1. When considering
the condition where x(0) is transmitted, the error probability of Pr(x(0) → xˆ(w′)|w′ 	= 0) can

Hence, the design parameter Υ(X , ξ), which is given in (8), can be obtained.
If we use the term δ · [1 − λ2(, ′)] as the distance measure for x() and xˆ(′), by following
an analysis procedure similar to that from (9) to (17), we have

bits which differ at the k-th bit position compared to those of x(). 
In general, |X k | > 1, which means that the labelling bits of the signal vectors in X k may
differ in position other than the k-th bit compared to those of x(). In addition, the calculation
of PEP in Criterion 2 is dominated by the transmitted x() and its “nearest” signal vectors xˆ(′)
in X [19][20].

For the receiver illustrated in Fig. 5, in order to avoid the high complexity of the exhaustive-
search-based noncoherent MAP detector used in [16], we consider the detection method intro-
duced in [15], in which the entire procedure was divided into two steps: the amplitude estimation
for the channel coefficient, and detection based on phase quantization of the channel coefficient.

C. 模擬結果分析
We first consider the systems that do not include channel amplitude re-estimation. Curves A
and B in Fig. 6 show the BER results for the differential schemes provided in [15] using 16-
QAM and 16-APSK signal constellations, respectively, in which Gray labelling is considered.
Curves A and B reveal that a high error floor exists for the system. In order to improve the
performance in the error-floor region, we search for the labelling rule based on Criterion 1. Since
there exists 16! possible labelling rules in total, it is difficult to try these rules one by one. Hence,
we use a modified binary switching algorithm (BSA), which is capable of determining a locally
optimal labelling rule [24]. For the case using the 16-QAM, the resultant labelling rule is the
Ungerboeck labelling (Curve C), while for the case using the 16-APSK, the resultant labelling
rule lacks any structure (Curve E). It is shown that the improvement in the error-floor region over
the scheme presented in [15] is significant, especially for the system using 16-APSK signals. We
then consider the systems with channel amplitude re-estimation. Curves D and F respectively
demonstrate the error performance of 16-QAM and 16-APSK, when using the proposed iterative
channel amplitude estimator. Performance gains of about 0.25 dB and 0.1 dB can be respectively
observed at the BER of 10−4 for the cases using the 16-QAM (Curves C and D) and 16-APSK
(Curves E and F).

performance was also observed. Based on the mathematical results provided in Sections II-III,
this section describes how codeword-interleaving criteria are obtained for the noncoherent coded
APM signals transmitted through the Rayleigh block fading channel.
A. 系統描述
The transmitter considered here is obtained by inserting a codeword interleaver between the
bit interleaver and the differential APM modulator illustrated in Fig. 5. As a result, the output
of the bit interleaver is re-denoted as v. Thus, v and b are the input and output of the bit-wise
codeword interleaver, respectively. Let vt = [v
H
t ,v
T
t ] denote the t-th bit-interleaved codeword,
where two equal-sized vectors vHt and v
T
t denote the first and the second half of vt, respectively.
An example of the uniform codeword interleaving for the differential APM signals is illustrated
in Fig. 8, where the bit labelling vector of the modulator for Ns coherence intervals, bt, is
obtained by uniformly interleaving vHt with v
T
t−1.
For the convenience of describing the codeword-interleaving rule, we define a length-(TRm−1)
interleaving position vector Γ. For the modulation blocks labeled bt, Γ(r) yields a value of 1 if the
r-th labelling bit within a coherence interval is from vHt . In contrast, Γ(r) yields a value of 0 if the
r-th labelling bit within a coherence interval is from vTt−1. For example, for the bit-wise uniform
codeword-interleaving rule illustrated in Fig. 8, Γ = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. More

When considering the t-th codeword vt, for each different code bit within a distance-d error
event, the bit may be interleaved to different coherence intervals, which contain labelling bits
from not only vt, but also v
T
t−1 or v
H
t+1, according to the labelling bit positions defined by Γ.
Hence, Γ should be taken into consideration in Criteria 3 and 4, which are used to design the
proposed coded schemes with codeword interleaving for better error performance.

x(′)∈X˜k [δ · [1− λ

. (24)
The set X˜ k is defined for the signal vectors which satisfy the constraint that its labelling bit at
the r-th bit position is the same as that of x(), if Γ(r) = 0, ∀r 	= k, while its labelling bit at
the k-th bit position is different from that of x(). Among these vectors, the set that includes the
vectors nearest to x() is denoted as X˜ k . 
The basic concept of Criterion 3 is explained as follows. When we focus on the k-th labelling
bit within a coherence block and assume that it comes from the codeword vt, Γ(k) = 0 implies
that this labelling bit comes from vTt , and is interleaved with other labelling bits from v
T
t and
vHt+1. Following an analysis procedure similar to that given in Section III-A, we assume that the
a priori information for other labelling bits from vTt within the same coherence block is perfectly
obtained from the channel decoder. However, the next codeword vt+1 has not been decoded (and
detected). Hence, for the labelling bits from vHt+1, we assume that their a priori information is
not yet available for the detection. In this case, (X , ξ,Γ(k)) is calculated from the signal set
X˜ k . In contrast, Γ(k) = 1 indicates that this labelling bit comes from vHt , and is interleaved
with other labelling bits from vHt and v
T
t−1. Since the detection and decoding process for vt−1
has been accomplished, we assume that the a priori information for all the other labelling bits,
either from vHt or v
T
t−1, is available. Hence, in this case, (X , ξ,Γ(k)) is calculated from only
one signal vector x(ξ(, k)).

considers neither codeword-interleaving nor channel amplitude re-estimation (Curve C) at a BER
of 10−4. Moreover, it was also verified that the proposed codeword-interleaving strategy, as well

high-SNR approximation of the PEP was formulated. The asymmetric property of the PEP
performance was examined. In the second, a noncoherent coded scheme based on a codeword-
interleaving strategy was investigated, and the design criteria for the labelling/codeword-interleaving
rules have been derived. Simulation results show that a significant improvement can be achieved
for both turbo-coded and convolutional-coded schemes, when compared to the schemes reported
in the previous literature.

THEOREM 1 的證明
For the simplicity of presentation, we write λ(a, b) as λab in the Appendices. We first re-
formulate (3) as follows
Pr(xa → xb) = Pr
{
ρPa
1 + ρPa
[
1
ρPa
+ 1
1
ρPb
+ 1
· tr(y†sbs†by)− tr(y†sas†ay)
]
> ln
(
1 + ρPb
1 + ρPa
)}
.
(A-1)
Write s†bsa = λab · ν, where λab is a real and nonnegative value and ν is a complex number with
|ν|2 = 1. The power of the inner product guarantees 0 ≤ λ2ab ≤ 1. We first define
r ≡
⎡
⎣ r1
r2

⎦ =

ρPa
1 + ρPa
⎡
⎢⎣ ν
∗s†ay√
1+ 1
ρPa
1+ 1
ρPb
s†by
⎤
⎥⎦ . (A-2)
(A-1) can thus be rewritten as
Pr(xa → xb) = Pr
{[
ρPa
1 + ρPa
·
1
ρPa
+ 1
1
ρPb
+ 1
· tr{y†sbs†by}
− ρPa
1 + ρPa
· tr{y†saνν∗s†ay}
]
> ln{1 + ρPb
1 + ρPa
}
}
(A-3)
= Pr
{
r∗2r2 − r∗1r1 > ln{
1 + ρPb
1 + ρPa
}
}
. (A-4)
By defining a random variable z = r∗2r2− r∗1r1 and qm = ln
(
1+ρPb
1+ρPa
)
, (A-4) can be written as
Pr(xa → xb) = Pr{z > qm} =

φz(−w) = E

When Pa = Pb = P , we have km = 12 , which is positive, and qm = 0. It can be derived from
(A-13) that
Pr(xa → xb) = 1

THEOREM 2 的證明
In the following, we derive the high-SNR approximation for the PEP by considering two

Since 0 < 1

When the value of ρ is large, we have km → 12 and qm → ln(PbPa ), and obtain
Pr(xa → xb) ≈
[
ρ · eln( PbPa )Pa · (1− λ2ab)
]−1
=
[
ρ · Pb · (1− λ2ab)

Case 2, qm < 0 (Pa > Pb) : It can be derived from (A-13) that
