mance is ”robust” with respect to external disturbances.
The robustness issue of nonlinear observer against dis-
turbance is rarely studied in the literature [18]-[20]. Pre-
vious nonlinear observer designs [18]-[20] ensure only
bounded-input bounded-state stability, while the new
observer in this project ensures practical stability. In
other words, when the system is subject to a large dis-
turbance, previous observers result in a bounded but
large state estimation error, while the new observer in
this paper results in almost zero estimation error in the
face of large disturbances.
2. Nonlinear Observer
Consider the state estimation problem for a non-
linear system
x˙ = Ax+Bu+G1f(x), (1)
y = Cx
where x ∈ Rn is the unknown system state, u ∈ Rm
the control input, y ∈ Rp the measured system output,
and f(x) ∈ Rq is a nonlinearity satisfying the Lipschitz
condition:
‖f(x)− f(xˆ)‖ ≤ γ‖x− xˆ‖, (2)
for some Lipschitz constant γ > 0. It is assumed that
dim(y) ≥ dim(f(x)). (3)
However, without loss of generality it is assumed in the
sequel that dim(y) = dim(f(x)); the case dim(y) >
dim(f(x)) can be treated similarly by artificially ex-
panding the dimension of f(x). Further, it is assumed
that (A,C) is observable, (A,G1) controllable, and the
square system (A + αI,G1, C) has only stable zeros
(minimum-phase), where α > 0 is a design parameter
to be specified later. Notice that one does not require
the boundedness assumption of the control input in the
analysis of the proposed observer in this project.
The proposed nonlinear observer for the system (1) is
of the following structure,
˙ˆx = Axˆ+Bu+ L(y − Cxˆ) +G1f(xˆ), (4)
where the output injection gain L ∈ Rn×p is designed
as in the linear LTR observer [16, 17],
L =
1
µ
QCT , µ = 1,
Q(A+ αI)T + (A+ αI)Q − QC
TC
µ
Q+ piG1GT1 = 0.(5)
In References [7], [8], [10], their nonlinear observers use
an H∞ Riccati equation [21], which contains the Lips-
chitz constant γ. In order for their Riccati equation to
have a positive definite solution matrix, the Lipschitz
constant γ is constrained to be small. In contrast, this
project uses the LQ (H2) Riccati equation (5), which is
γ independent. The existence and positive definiteness
of the solution matrix of (5) is always guaranteed [21] if
(A,C) is observable and (A,G1) controllable.
Note that the solution matrix Q ∈ Rn×n depends on
the design parameter pi in (5). The relationship between
Q(pi) and pi satisfies the following theorem.
Theorem 1 [22] : If the system (A + αI,G1, C)
is minimum-phase, C and G1 are full rank, and
rank(CT ) = rank(G1), the solution Q(pi) of the ob-
server Riccati equation (5) satisfies
lim
pi→∞
Q(pi)
pi
= 0.
The state estimation error x˜ = x − xˆ resulting from
the above nonlinear observer satisfies
˙˜x = (A− LC)x˜+G1(f(x)− f(xˆ)). (6)
The goal of this section is to prove that even for large
Lipschitz constant in (2), the error dynamics (6) is glob-
ally exponentially stable if pi in (5) is sufficiently large.
This is the purpose of Theorem 2 below.
Theorem 2 : Consider the nonlinear system (1) with
C and G1 both full rank, rank(CT ) = rank(G1), and
(A + αI,G1, C) minimum-phase. For whatever large
Lipschitz constant γ in (2), if the design parameter pi >
0 in the Riccati equation (5) is sufficiently large, the
state estimate xˆ of the nonlinear observer (4) approaches
the true state x exponentially fast.
Proof: omitted.
Remark 1: The proposed nonlinear observer (4) has
three design parameters: pi, α, and µ in (5). Normally,
pi > 0 must be sufficiently large to ensure the observer
stability, and α > 0 is to specify the estimation error
convergence rate. Finally, µ is usually chosen to be one.
Remark 2: The proof of Theorem 2 mandates that the
observer design parameter pi must satisfy
σ¯(
Q(pi)
pi
) <
2α
γ2
(7)
to ensure the observer stability. If the Lipschitz constant
γ is known, and α has been chosen, one can determine
a stabilizing pi by referring to a figure that depicts the
value of σ¯(Q)/pi versus pi. Figure 1 shows such a figure
for the system (A, [G1, G2], C) in the simulation example
in the next section.

Proof: omitted.
Remark 4: Theorem 4 shows that the nonlinear ob-
server (4) and (5) in the previous section is robust
against disturbance that comes into the system equation
in the same direction as the nonlinearity. However, as
shown in Theorem 3, when the disturbance comes into
the system equation in a direction different from that of
the nonlinearity, the Riccati equation in the nonlinear
observer must be modified according to (12) so that the
disturbance’s effect on the observer can be reduced.
Remark 5: One should be aware that applying high
gain (using large design parameter pi in the observer
Riccati equation) may not always increase the robust-
ness of the observer if the linear part of the nonlinear
system is not minimum-phase. Hence, as shown in The-
orems 3 and 4, high gain design is feasible only under
the minimum-phase condition.
Example: Consider a flexible joint robot [24], whose
governing equation is as in (8) with
A =


u(t) = 0, and nonlinearity f(x) = −10sin(x1). Note
that the nonlinearity f(x) is globally Lipschitz, and the
large Lipschitz constant λ = 10 implies a long or heavy
robot arm. Note also that the system is subject to a
bounded disturbance d(t) = 2.
The initial conditions are xT (0) = [1, 1, 1, 1] for the
robot, and xˆT (0) = [−1,−1,−1,−1] for the observer
(11). The modified Riccati equation (12) has design
parameters µ = 1, α = 1, and pi(t) scheduled stepwisely
from 1 to 1012 within 8 seconds according to the formula
pi(t) = 103k, t ∈ [2k, 2k + 2), k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
Figure 2 shows the state estimation error ‖x˜(t)‖ ver-
sus time. The estimation error decays to almost zero
(‖x˜(t)‖ ≈ 10−3), confirming that the proposed robust
nonlinear observer design is successful in the face of
disturbances and large-Lipschitz-constant nonlinearity.
Note that if one uses pi = 1012 right from the beginning
of observation, there will be substantial peaking phe-
nomenon. The proposed stepwise scheduling of pi(t) has
effectively reduced the peaking phenomenon.
1 Conclusions
This project proposes a new robust nonlinear ob-
server for systems subject to Lipschitz nonlinearity and
bounded external disturbances. The linear part of the
observer, like the linear LTR observer, is based on an
LQ Riccati equation design. Robustness of the proposed
observer is achieved by asymptotic tuning of the design
parameter in the Riccati equation. It is proved that
the proposed nonlinear observer ensures that the esti-
mation error can decay to arbitrarily small values in the
face of large Lipschitz nonlinearity and large external
disturbances.
