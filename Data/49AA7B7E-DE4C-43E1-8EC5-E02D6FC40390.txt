英文摘要 
This is a three-year project devoted to investigating 
the nanometer scale trap physics as well as reliability 
physics in nonvolatile memory. In the first year, the 
energy system associated with the nanoscale trap in 
tunnel oxide of 0.15 um Flash memory will be 
experimentally established on the basis of our 2005 
Physical Review –B article addressing the underlying 
trap physics. Flash memory test-key will be provided 
from such collaborators as Silicon Storage Technology 
(in Taiwan and the US) and the colleagues in certain 
universities. Meanwhile, electrical characterizations as 
well as long-term accelerated degradation experiment 
(refer to our 2005 IEEE TED Flash memory paper) will 
be carried out such as to accommodate study on 
reliability physics. The reliability physics here is 
involved with our series of publications over many years 
on the oxide trap mechanism and Flash memory related 
issues. The published 2005 Physical Review-B paper is 
also included as well. Furthermore, we want to extend 
the nanoscale trap physics by building up a 
comprehensive wavefunction based quantum mechanical 
numerical model. Then under the same energy system, 
we can consistently deal with quantum dot or nanocrystal 
physics in the oxide.  In the second year, we continue 
the way but on the next-generation 0.13 um Flash 
memory. More test-key will be possible from more 
colleague collaborators. Also conducted are Hall effect

We observe a sequence of two-level random telegraph signals RTSs in the drain/source current of
a 1.7 nm gate oxide silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. The RTS magnitude is
transformed into the apparent Debye length around a negatively charged oxide trap. We achieve
excellent reproduction of the Debye data 40 down to 5 nm. This leads to the quantified area
spanned by the dominant conductive percolation paths in the underlying two-dimensional electron
gas 2DEG. We find that most of the 2DEG in inversion is recovered in a largest threshold voltage
sample 0.35 V, while for the lowest threshold 0.15 V, a certain conductive filament is likely
to occur. The gate direct tunneling current further corroborates the percolation picture. © 2008

I. INTRODUCTION
Silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transis-
tors MOSFETs have been widely utilized as a test vehicle
of random telegraph signals RTSs.1–14 In the presence of a
certain oxide trap with the energetic level in the proximity of
silicon Fermi level, the on and off of the local conduction in
a two-dimensional electron gas 2DEG due to the fluctuat-
ing occupancy of the trap give rise to RTS in the drain/source
current. This well-known two-level RTS can be characterized
by three key factors in terms of the mean capture time, the
mean emission time, and the relative amplitude. So far, mea-
surements of the former two switching time constants have
exhibited potential applications, such as determination of the
energetic level of the trap and its depth into the
oxide1,3,5,7–9,11,14,15 identification of the neutral or attractive-
type trap,7,8 and construction of a configuration coordinate
diagram for the electron-lattice system.2,9,14,15 In addition,
analyses of capture/emission time constants obtained at very
low temperatures have produced important findings, such as
the trapping statistics change due to the interaction between
the trap and the 2DEG Ref. 10 and the electron spin proper-
ties of the oxide trap.12,13 The RTS time constant based elec-
tron spin resonance has also been experimentally
demonstrated.13 On the other hand, the remaining RTS coun-
terpart, namely, the relative amplitude, can be well described
by a screened Debye length model,6 valid only for the uni-
form channel case. Owing to the manufacturing process
variations, however, the nonuniformity or percolation nature
may prevail in the 2DEG beneath the gate oxide and,
thereby, affect the RTS magnitude.3,4,6,16–18 Thus, if the RTS
magnitude deviates from that of the screened Debye length
model,6 then the created errors should reflect the relevant
information about the dominant conductive percolation paths
in the underlying 2DEG. However, little work has been per-
formed in this direction.
In this work, we elaborate on the extraction of the 2DEG
percolation area from the MOSFET RTS amplitude. A link-
age with the threshold voltage is established. Also presented
are the gate direct tunneling current data that can corroborate
the percolation picture built in this work.
II. RTS MEASUREMENT
The device under study was n-channel MOSFET fabri-
cated in a state-of-the-art manufacturing process. The follow-
ing key process parameters were obtained through the
capacitance-voltage fitting: n+ polysilicon doping concentra-
tion of 1.31020 cm−3, gate oxide thickness of 1.7 nm, and
channel doping concentration of 81017 cm−3. A semicon-
ductor parameter analyzer HP4156 was utilized with the
source and bulk tied to the ground and the drain connected to
a bias of 10 mV. The measurement temperature was 297 K.
The probability of finding RTS events across the whole wa-
fer was extremely low. Only a few devices were eventually
identified with two-level RTS, as displayed in Fig. 1 for a
certain sample. As shown in Fig. 1, the same RTS events in
the source current also simultaneously occurred in the drain
current. No noticeable change in the gate current was de-
tected, meaning that the trap responsible for the RTS is an
atomic-sized trap relative to the 1.7 nm gate oxide used. This
trap should be naturally created during the manufacturing
process, rather than caused by the electrical stressing in the
long-term RTS measurement. On the other hand, the well
recognized trap assisted tunneling component was difficult to
distinguish in the measured gate current i.e., high level cor-
responding to the empty trap state since the trap itself occu-
pies a very small part of the gate oxide area.
The measured capture time c associated with the high
current level and the measured emission time e associated
with the low current level each was found to be exponen-
tially distributed. The ratio of the mean capture time c and
the mean emission time e is shown in Fig. 2 for several
samples labeled as traps A, B, C, and D versus the gate
overdrive voltage that is, gate voltage minus threshold volt-
age. The zero gate overdrive voltage represents the classical
onset of the inversion. From the aspect of electrostatics, theaElectronic mail: chenmj@faculty.nctu.edu.tw.

2, as well as the derivation and validity of Eqs. 1 and 2,
will be interpreted later. In Eq. 2, LS is a double of the
critical distance from the trapped electron where the Cou-
lomb potential energy is equal to the carrier average kinetic
energy kT in 2DEG Ref. 6 and can be written as LS
=q2 /2effkT. Here, eff is the effective permittivity and
should be a function of both the silicon permittivity Si and
the SiO2 permittivity ox. One of the expressions, eff= Si
+ox /2, whose validity can be testified by comparing the
existing sophisticated device simulation results,18 was
adopted here. As for LC, it is the screening length by the
2DEG, and in the quantum limit, it can be written as LC
=21.5 SikT /q2NS.19 With eff→Si, 1→1, and 2→1, the
case of uniform channel, Eqs. 1 and 2 both exactly reduce
to those of the existing screened Debye length model.6 As
shown in Fig. 4 for the samples of traps B and D, an excel-
lent reproduction of Lt is achieved over the subthreshold and
inversion regimes, leading to the values of 1 and 2. Al-
though the observed RTS of traps A and C is limited to the
inversion regime, the subthreshold 1, in addition to inver-
sion 2, can be reasonably obtained through the best fitting
technique.
To testify the validity of the above percolation extraction
process, the underlying trap must be first identified. It is
known that the mean capture time to mean emission time
ratio can read as7,8
c
e
= eET−EF+E/kBT. 3
Here, the trap level ET relative to the channel quasi-Fermi
level EF can be readily quantified by the same self-consistent
Schrödinger-Poisson equation solving. The Coulomb energy
E required in the charging of the oxide trap can be written
as
7,8
E = QGqVG + QdepEF − Evo + Qinv − 1EF − E0 , 4
where QG, Qinv, and Qdep are the normalized image polar-
ized charges induced on the gate, the inversion layer, and
the silicon depletion region, respectively, E0 is the lowest
subband level, and Evo is the valence band edge in the silicon
substrate. These fractional charges can be calculated using a
trap depth dependent capacitance model.14 Best fitting was
achieved in a wide range of gate overdrive voltage, as shown
in Fig. 2, yielding the values of the trap depth zT and the
energetic level EOX−ET EOX denotes the oxide conduction-
band edge. It can be inferred that an interfacelike neutral
trap exists in devices of traps A, C, and D, while a deep
neutral trap in oxide prevails in trap B. Therefore, the afore-
mentioned percolation extraction process is validated.
IV. INTERPRETATIONS AND PERCOLATION PICTURE
Equations 1 and 2 can be derived from the two ex-
treme cases: the subthreshold and the strong inversion. In the
former limit, the area of the dominant percolation regime can
be approximated as the gate area WL times the square of 1.
Uniform conductivity6 is assumed across the percolation area
as implicitly included in 1. Under such situations, one can
draw ID / IDLS
2 /1
2WL accordingly.6 Another limiting
case can apply similarly but with LS replaced by LC and 1
by 2. The arrangement of the different percolation coeffi-
cients is reasonable since the different operating conditions
can encounter different percolation paths, as revealed by the
sophisticated device simulations.16–18 As for the transition
regime between the lower and upper limits, it can be readily
treated by using one of the expressions such as Eq. 2 as
originally cited elsewhere.6 Therefore, the experimentally de-
termined Lt on the basis of Eq. 1 is able to provide the
picture of the nonuniformities, depending on the extracted 1
and 2 through Eq. 2.
Some issues of relevance must be addressed prior to
dealing with the extracted percolation quantities. Firstly, if
the gate-to-diffusion overlap size is around 6 nm,20 then the
channel length deviates less from the gate length used. In
other words, the error due to the direct use of the gate area in
Eq. 1, rather than the active channel area, is insignificant.
Secondly, the existing device simulations4 point out that a
significant change in the relative amplitude can be seen only
for the trap depth critically exceeding around 10 nm, much
larger than that 0.65 nm of the deep trap in our work.
Therefore, the trap depth effect on the RTS relative magni-
tude is negligible for the samples studied. Finally, the device
performance parameters such as the carrier mobility in Table
I are comparable between the samples, except the threshold
voltage that varies in a wide range of 0.15–0.35 V.
