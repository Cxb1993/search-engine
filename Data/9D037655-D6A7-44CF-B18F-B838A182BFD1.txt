system, interferometer, will be added into current optical tweezers system at
Professor Su, Fong-Chin’s (蘇芳慶) laboratory. The interferometer with new
vibration isolation system will dramatically increase the accuracy and stability
of the current optical tweezers system.
文獻探討:
Recent studies have shown that the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
bound to decorin act like bridges between contiguous fibrils connecting adjacent
fibril every 64-68 nm; this architecture would suggest their possible role in
providing the mechanical integrity of the tendon structure.(Redaelli et al. 2003)
Concerning the matrix stiffness, shear stresses alone are not sufficient to explain
the tendon stress-strain relationship if no linkage is taken into account between
the fibrils and the matrix.
Decorin links non-covalently to the collagen fibril at the fibril gap
regions every 68 nm (Cribb and Scott 1995;Scott 1992); the binding occurs
between one triple helix of collagen and the decorin concave surface.(Scott
1996). Only one GAG chain is attached covalently to the decorin protein and is
mainly aligned orthogonally to the major axis of the collagen fibril (Scott et al.
1981), its length ranges between 60 and 160 nm.(Pins et al. 1997;Raspanti et al.
1997)
Optical tweezers had been used several fields like DNA
mechanics(Bryant et al. 2003;Nishimura et al. 1999;Arai et al.
1999;Sakata-Sogawa et al. 1998), molecular mechanics,(Liu et al. 2004;Liu et al.
2003;Mehta et al. 1998;Sun et al. 2001) protein unfolding,(Kellermayer et al.
1997;Kellermayer et al. 1998) cell manipulation, (Walker et al. 1999;Wu et al.
2005) membrane mechanics (Bar-Ziv et al. 1998;Henon et al. 1999;Sleep et al.
1999) Only few studies used optical tweezers to determine the binding between
two molecules. (Sun et al. 2004;Luo et al. 2004) However, in Taiwan, this
approach has not been used in biomechanics. This project using this new cutting
edge technology could bring biomechanics in Taiwan into molecular level.
研究方法:
The force calculation system of current optical tweezers system at
Professor Fong-Chin Su’s (蘇芳慶) laboratory used directly imaging processing.
The force value relies on the accurate imaging of bead and laser. It is more time
consuming and less accurate. A new optic sensing system, interferometer, will
