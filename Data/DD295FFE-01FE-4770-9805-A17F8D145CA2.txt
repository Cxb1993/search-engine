First Year Report: 
Transient dislocation emission from a crack tip in an anisotropic 
elastic material  
 
Abstract 
 
     The emission of a dislocation with a general Burgers vector from the tip of a 
stationary semi-infinite crack in an anisotropic elastic material is examined. The dislocation 
is assumed to leave the crack tip along the crack extension plane at constant speed. Explicit 
expressions for the transient shielding stress intensity factors at the crack tip and the drag 
forces on the dislocations are derived. Numerical results for a class of cubic materials are 
given. 
      
2、INTRODUCTION 
 
    The problem of dislocation emission from a crack tip has been extensively studied due 
to its importance in understanding brittle-to-ductile transition of materials. Most of the 
studies on the facture-dislocation interaction have been largely quasi-static and cannot 
provide information about rate effects of dislocation emission or stress wave effects of 
dynamic loading. The relatively few transient analyses were made by Brock and coworkers 
(Brock and Jolles, 1987; Brock, 1989; Brock and Wu, 1990a, b) for screw dislocations, by 
Yang et al. (2001) for edge and climb dislocations. However, in these works the materials 
are assumed isotropic while most crystals are anisotropic. The objective of this paper is to 
provide the solution of transient emission for general anisotropic materials, which is still 
lacking in the literature.  
Although the glide planes of dislocations are usually inclined to the crack extension 
plane (Chiao and Clark, 1989), they are assumed to coincide for simplicity in the present 
work. The problem considered is as follows. A pair of dislocations with opposite Burgers 
vectors ±β is located at the tip of a semi-infinite crack coinciding with the negative 1x  axis 
for t < 0 in an infinite anisotropic elastic medium. The medium is stress-free and at rest 
for 0t  . At t = 0 the dislocation with β begins to move with a constant subsonic velocity c 
along the positive 1x  axis and the dislocation with -β remains at the origin. A schematic 
diagram of the problem is given in Fig. 1. 
   The customary approach to the analysis of the transient motion is based on integral 
transform methods and inversion by the Cagniard-de Hoop (1962) technique. Recently a 
sextic formalism for self-similar dynamic problems was proposed by Wu (2000). In the 
proposed formalism the general solution is directly expressed in terms of the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors of a six-dimensional eigenvalue problem. A major advantage of the

5. MOVING DISLOCATION IN AN INFINITE SOLID WITH A SEMI-INFINITE 
CRACK 
 
 If the dislocation considered in the previous section is now moving in the presence of a 
semi-infinite crack coinciding with the negative x₁-axis, the stress given by (38) must be 
negated to satisfy the traction-free conditions on the crack faces. The pair of concentrated 
forces, dF and - dF, that must be applied at a fixed time t to remove the stress over an 
infinitesimal portion of the upper and lower crack faces, respectively, is given by

where v = -y₁, v ≥ 0. It may be observed that the opposite pair of forces moves along the 
upper and lower crack faces at a constant speed v from the crack tip. The stress dt₂ due to the 
moving forces for x₁	> 0 and x₂	= 0 is given by (Wu, 2004)

6. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES 
 
Consider cubic materials with the elastic constants characterized by the following two 
dimensionless parameters A and B:  
 66 12
11 12 66
2 ,
2
C CA B
C C C
   (53) 
where A > 0 and B > -1/(3A). The parameter A is Zener’s anisotropy factor. It may be shown 
that the slower shear wave exists only if A > 1.  The shielding stress intensity factors and the 
drag forces were calculated for A = .5, 1, 2, 10 and B = 1. The material with A = 1 is isotropic 
with the Poisson ratio ν = 1/3. The slower shear wave speed sc  for A = 2 and 10 are, 
respectively, 20.90c and 20.44c . The Rayleigh surface wave speed Rc  for A = .5, 1, 2 and 10 
are, respectively, 20.98c , 20.93c , 20.81c and 20.43c . 
    The variation of the shielding stress intensity factors IK  and IIK , normalized by 
44 2 / 2C ct   and 44 1 / 2C ct  , respectively, with respect to the dislocation speed, 
normalized by 2c , is shown in Fig.2. It is observed that IK  is greater than IIK  for a 
given A and the difference increases with c but decreases with A. Either IK  or IIK  
increases with c for a given A and decreases with A for a given c.  
The variation of the forces on the dislocation 1F  and 2F , normalized by 
2
44 / 4C ct   is shown in Fig.3. It is seen that 2F  is greater than 1F  for a given A and the 
difference increases with c but decreases with A. Either 2F  or 1F  increases with c for a 
given A. In particular the forces increase significantly as c approaches Rc  for A = 10. 
 
7. CONCLUSION 
     An analysis of the transient problem of a dislocation with a general Burgers vector 
emitted from the crack tip with a subsonic speed has been presented. Explicit solutions for the 
transient shielding stress intensity factors at the crack tip and the drag forces on the 
dislocations are derived. The solutions contain Wiener-Hopf factorization of a matrix for 
general anisotropic materials. At present, however, no systematic method is available for 
matrix factorization except for orthotropic materials, for which the corresponding matrix is

A symmetric matrix function L(v) plays an important role in constructing the solution. 
The matrix L(v) is one of the matrices introduced by Barnett and Lothe (1973) for a steady 
state motion with a constant speed v. It appears in many problems in dynamic fracture 
mechanics. Indeed, for a crack extending steadily at speed v, the energy release rate is related 
to L(v) (Wu, 1989). The SIFs for a crack expanding self-similarly at speed v under uniform 
stress are expressed in terms of a certain integral containing L(v) (Wu, 2000b). The SIFs of a 
semi-infinite crack loaded by an obliquely incident plane stress wave depend on a 
Wiener-Hopf factorization of L(v) (Wu, 2004), as in the present problem.  
    The plan of the paper is as follows. First the basic formalism of Wu (2000a) is outlined. 
Next the solution of a moving dislocation from the crack tip derived recently by Wu (2011) 
is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4 explicit expressions for the SIFs are derived. Finally 
numerical examples are given for isotropic, cubic and orthotropic materials.

    The dynamic stress intensity factors due to a concentrated force suddenly applied to one 
of the faces of a semi-infinite crack in a general anisotropic material have been derived and 
given by Eq.(28). For orthotropic materials 11k  and 22k  exhibit a square root singularity at 
/ Rt c  and then take on their corresponding static values, which are independent of the 
material constants. Similarly as soon as the shear wave arrives, 33k assumes its static value. 
For 12k  and 21k the values are finite for
*
1Rc v c  . A square root singularity occurs at the 
arrival of the surface wave. Thereafter the values decrease to zero as 1/ t  when 
t  .The expressions for the stress intensity factors require Wiener-Hopf factorization of a 
matrix for general anisotropic materials. At present, however, no systematic method is 
available for matrix factorization except for orthotropic materials, for which the 
corresponding matrix is diagonal.

1 Introduction
In this paper the problem of a semi-innite crack propagating with constant
speed in an elastic solid under a uniform stress wave loading is studied. The
crack is initially at rest. A uniform plane stress wave propagates toward the
crack at an angle  with respect to the crack line. The stress wave impinges
the crack tip at t = 0. At some later time t =  ; the crack begins to extend
in its own plane with constant speed v: The conguration is shown in Fig.1.
Baker (1962) rst considered the special case where a tensile wave is
incident at  = =2 and the crack propagates immediately after the crack tip
is loaded, i.e.,  = 0. Freund (1973) treated the Baker problem but assumed
that the onset of crack extension occurs at a nite delay time  > 0: In a
subsequent paper Freund (1974) further generalized the problem by allowing
arbitrary incident angle . The aforementioned works are all for isotropic
materials. The Baker problem was extended to orthotropic materials under
mode I and mode II loading by Rubio-Gonzalez and Mason (2001). The
derived dynamic stress intensity factors, however, do not reduce to the results
for isotropic materials obtained by Freund (1973). It is the objective of
this paper to further generalize Freunds result (Freund, 1974) by including
material anisotropy.
The customary approach to the analysis of transient motion is based on
integral transform methods and inversion by the Cagniard (1962) technique.
In this paper, however, a sextic formalism for elastodynamic problems for
2
equation of motion is
t1;1 + t2;2 = u (1)
where t1 = (11; 21; 31)T; t2 = (12; 22; 32)T, u is the acceleration,  is
the density, a subscript comma denotes partial di¤erentiation with respect to
coordinates and an overhead dot designates derivative with respect to time
t. The stress-strain laws are
t1 = Qu;1 +Ru;2 (2)
t2 = R
Tu;1 +Tu;2 (3)
where the matrices Q, R; and T are related to the elastic constants Cijks by
Qik = Ci1k1; Rik = Ci1k2; Tik = Ci2k2
The equations of motion expressed in terms of the displacements are obtained
by substituting (2) and (3) into (1) as

For two-dimensional deformation in which the displacement u is a homoge-
neous functions of order 0, let (Wu, 2000)
u = F (w) ;F0 (w) = f (w) a (w) ; (5)

where Re stands for the real part of. The eigenvalues pk (!) ; k = 1; 2; 3;

or p0k (!) > 0 when it is real. The corresponding stress vectors t2 can be
expressed as

The matrix L (y1) is real and positive denite for jy1j < cR; where cR is the
Rayleigh surface wave speed determined by jL(cR)j = 0 . It is assumed that
L (z) ; z being a complex variable, is analytic in the strip + < Re (z) <  ;
where + < 0 and   > 0. Furthermore we shall assume that L (z) admits a
Wiener-Hopf type factorization as (Wu, 2004)
L (z) = L  (z)L+ (z) (23)
Since L (0) is real, L  (0) and L+ (0) are also real. By analytic continuation
Im [L  (y1)] = 0; y1 <  ; Im [L+ (y1)] = 0; y1 > +: (24)

and, Y (c4) = 0, if such a real root exists, otherwise c4 = c2. The wave
speed c4 corresponds to a slower in-plane shear wave traveling along the
x1-direction, in addition to the faster shear wave with c2.

For q0 = 1; q1 = 0 (28), (29) and (30) are in the same forms as those for
a pair of concentrated forces p travelling on the faces of a stationary crack
(Wu, 2004). Thus the stress intensity factor is given by

The case q0 = 0; q1 = 1 is the same as the previous case except that
the magnitude of the concentrated forces increases linearly with t. It can be

The traction t0 on the planes normal to n is given by

Thus the plane wave of (40) represents a uniform stress wave that carries a
jump in the traction on the wavefront from zero to  0d: In general there

the di¤racted stress eld of (47) as well as the uniform stress of (45) must be
removed at the interval 0  x1  v (t  ) ; x2 = 0 for t >  . The element
of negating force, dP = t (p (u) + t) du; begins to act on each crack face
as the crack tip passes its point of application. The encounter time t0 is
determined from ut0 = v (t0   ) and is given by
t0 = v=u: (49)
where u is dened by (31). The force element continues to act on each crack
face and it continues to move along the crack line at speed u: If the force
element is rewritten as
dP = [t0du+ (t  t0) du] (p (u) + t) ;
the solution due to the force element can be obtained from the fundamental
solution discussed in the preceding section by setting q0 = t0du and q1 = du
and by replacing t with t  t0: In paticular, the corresponding stress intensity

Transient analysis of collinear cracks under anti-plane 
dynamic loading 
K. C. Wu* and J. C. Chen
Institute of Applied Mechanics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan 
Abstract 
The problem of a homogeneous linear elastic body containing multiple collinear cracks under anti-plane dynamic 
load is considered in this work. The cracks are simulated by distributions of dislocations and an integral equation 
relating tractions on the crack planes and the dislocation densities is derived. The integral equation in the Laplace 
transform domain is solved by Gaussian-Chebyshev integration quadrature.  The dynamic stress intensity factor 
associated with each crack tip is calculated by a numerical inverse Laplace scheme. 
The proposed method was applied to calculate the stress intensity factors for M equally spaced cracks of identical 
length subject to impact loading with M =1～4. Comparison of the numerical result for a single crack with the 
analytic solution shows that the present method is highly accurate.

1. Introduction 
When a linear elastic solid containing cracks is subject to applied loads, the stress field near the crack 
tips exhibits a square-root singularity. The amplitudes of the singular stress field are characterized by the 
stress intensity factors, which are used as the parameters governing crack propagation. The stress intensity 
factors depend on applied loading, geometry, and applied loading. Because of the difficulties in satisfying

3. Fundamental Solution 
Consider a screw dislocation of Burgers vector , which suddenly appears at t = 0 at the origin in an 
infinite body that is initially at rest and stress-free. The slip plane is assumed to coincide with the negative 
x1-axis. From the jump condition for u and continuity condition for 2  at x2 = 0, (4) and (6) yield, for t

6. Examples
Consider M equally spaced cracks of length 2a subject to  2 0H t   , where 0 is a constant. The 
distance between the centers of the cracks is assumed to be 3a. The stress intensity factors for M =1～4,
were computed and the numerical results are shown, respectively, in Fig1.～Fig.4.
