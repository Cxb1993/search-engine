二、英文摘要 
In this study, we develop a novel nanocarrier for the delivery of photosenstizers and 
chemotherapeutic drugs for the combination of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. This 
study involves synthesis of new amphiphilic copolymer-porphyrin conjugates, 
monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-porphyrin,. It is amphiphilic and can 
form micelles in an aqueous system with hydrophobic porphyrin and PCL block in the core and 
MPEG in the shell. As some water-insoluble chemotherapeutic drug, Camptothecin (CPT), 
could be encapsulated in porphyrin-centered PCL-PEG micelles. The characterization, the 
intracellular distribution, and in vitro release studies of porphyrin-centered micelles f were 
investigated. In addition, we had investigated the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) 
combined with low-dose chemotherapy by the CPT-loaded porphyrin-centered PCL-PEG 
micelles on cervical cancer cells (Hela), colon cancer cells (HT29).

三、前言、文獻探討 
 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the accumulation of a photosensitizer (PS) in 
malignant tissues followed by illumination with light at an appropriate wavelength inducing 
photochemical reactions that result in tissue destruction. However, high partition coefficient 
values (increased hydrophobicity) are related to PS insolubility, with the drawback of 
impeding the use of physiologically acceptable aqueous vehicles for intravenous 
administration. In recent years, the development of delivery systems allowing the intravenous 
administration of hydrophobic PS has received increasing attention. Several research 
strategies such as chemical conjugation with various water-soluble polymers [1] and 
encapsulation into colloidal carriers, including liposomes [2], emulsions [3], polymeric 
micelles [4] and nanoparticles [5], have been considered for the parenteral administration of 
hydrophobic PS with the additional aim of enhancing their selectivity. 
In many cases, tumor tissues are supplied by a leaky neovasculature with an incomplete 
endothelial barrier and have a poor lymphatic drainage. This phenomenon is known as an 
enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) [6,7]. These tumor characteristics provide 
an opportunity for the colloidal carriers to reach their target site by diffusion (passive 
targeting) [8]. It has been demonstrated that passive targeting is limited to carrierswith a size 
of around 100 nm [9]. Conjugation of PS to macromolecular delivery vehicles may improve 
their performance in PDT by increasing specificity and/or uptake in tumors, favorably altering 
 
 
 
 
五、實驗方法 
2.1. Synthesis of hydroxyl-terminated MPEG-PCL 
Hydroxy-terminated MPEG/PCL amphiphilic block copolymers (MEP) were synthesized 
by a ring-opening polymerization ofε-caprolactone in the presence of MPEG homopolymer 
(MW =5000) as an iniciator with a trace amount of SnOct as catalyst, and the sealed flask was 
maintained at 140  ℃ for 24 h. The synthesized polymer was recovered by dissolving in 
methylene chloride followed by precipitation in ice-cooled diethyl ether. The resultant 
precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuum. The target molecular weights of PCL blocks 
were 2000, 8000. 
2.2. Synthesis of the porphyrin-conjugated MPEG/PCL block copolymer 
Hydroxy-terminated MPEG/PCL amphiphilic block copolymer (1mmol) was dissolved in 
5-25mL of dry dioxane by heating in a water bath. The clear solution was brought to room 
temperature, and N,N’-disuccinimidyl carbonate (5-7mmol dissovied in 10mL of acetone) 
was added. 4-(Dimetylamino)pyridine (5-7mmol in 10mL of dry acetone) was added slowly 
under magnetic stirring. Activation proceeded for 6h , the actived PCL-PEG was precipitated 
by diethyl ether. Removal of the staring materials in the actived PCL-PEG were followed by 
chromatography on TLC in chloroform-methanol (5:1) system. Tetra(4-aminoophenyl) 
porphyrin were conjugated with SC-PCL-PEG in chloroform for overnight(see Fig. 1). The 
mixture was dialyzed against chloroform-methanol (5:1) using a MWCO of 25000 or 50000 
for 72 h in the dark. Nonreacting SC-PCL-PEG and porphyrin were removed.

poly(ethylene glycol) Copolymers. 
 
2.3 Micelle Preparation and Drug loading 
The THF solution of the block copolymer was added dropwise into doubly distilled water 
to achieve the copolymer concentration from 1 mg/mL to 10-5mg/L, and then the THF was 
removed by evaporating under reduced pressure and dialysis against water for 72 h using 
Spectra/Por 4 Dialysis Membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 12000-14000 (Spectrum 
Laboratories Inc.; Rancho Cominquez, CA).  
The camptothecin (CPT) were incorporated into porphyrin centered PCL-PEG micelles. 
Briefly, a block copolymer and CPT were dissolved in THF and was added dropwise into

3.4 Cytotoxicity and Phototoxicity  
The concentration-dependent dark cytotoxicity was investigated in Hela and HT29 cells 
exposed to various concentrations of porphyrin-centered PCL-PEG micelles (0.125~2µg/ml) 
loading with low concentration of CPT for 24h in the dark (Table 1.). Following to the 
increase of porphyrins and CPT concentration, the phototoxicity increased upon exposure to 
low light dose (2.7J/cm2), as showed in Fig.7. The combinative therapy of CPT loaded 
porphyrin-centered PCL-PEG micelles is taken up to higher cytotoxicities in HT29 and Hela 
(Fig. 8.).

七、討論 
In this study, we had prepared new copolymer-porphyrin conjugates, monomethoxy-
poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-porphyrin, in which porphyrin is covalently 
connected to block copolymer MPEG-PCL. It is amphiphilic and can form micelles in an 
aqueous system with hydrophobic porphyrin and PCL block in the core and MPEG in the 
shell. As some water-insoluble chemotherapeutic drug, such as Camptothecin (CPT), could be 
encapsulated in porphyrin-centered PCL-PEG micelles. 
Furthermore, owing to the biodegradability of PEG-PCL, the release of CPT will be caused 
not only by the biodegradation of PEG-PCL, but also by the generation of free radicals and 
singlet oxygen during the light-irradiation of the core porphyrin, possibly. This porphyrin 
conjugated micellar system could be sensitive to light (PDT), and then release the 
encapsulated drugs. The free radicals and singlet oxygen maybe enhance the collapse the 
micelles structure. The combinative therapy of CPT loaded porphyrin-centered PCL-PEG 
micelles is taken up to higher cytotoxicities in HT29 and Hela.
