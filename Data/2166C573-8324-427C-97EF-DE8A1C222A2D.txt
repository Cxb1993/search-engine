Abstract 
The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been widely 
applied to the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation 
processing and GPS/INS (inertial navigation system) 
integrated systems as the navigation state estimator. The EKF 
uses first order Taylor series expansion, which can be 
improved by higher order approximations at the expense of 
computational burden. There are several alternatives for the 
classical EKF that can be employed. Recently, there has been 
an increasing interest in the development of techniques for 
nonlinear estimation. The IMM algorithm can be employed 
for dynamically adjusting the process noise by defining 
different models according to the situation in which the 
vehicle is involved, and hence further enhancing the 
estimation accuracy. The objective is to design the nonlinear 
filter for high dynamic or curvilinear motions in an IMM 
algorithm to navigate a maneuvering vehicle for the driving 
of a vehicle.  
The second part of the report presents the design of 
GPS receiver tracking loop using the UKF. The EKF can 
suitably combine multiple correlator branches for better code 
tracking as well as the other signal parameters, so as to 
estimate the multipath components for mitigating the 
multipath errors. The paper presented by Jee, et al was to 
design the GPS receiver tracking loop using the EKF, 
extracting and estimates parameters of the direct satellite 
signal component from the multipath corrupted signal for the 
lose lock problem in receiver tracking loop. The in-phase and 
quadrature (I&Q) correlator accumulator outputs are used as 
measurements in the filter estimation process. Selected 
results presented in this report confirm the improvements.

一、前言 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) (Brown and 
Hwang 1997; Farrell and Barth 1999) has been widely used 
in navigation and commercial products to provide location 
information. GPS and inertial navigation system (INS) have 
complementary operational characteristics and the synergy of 
both systems has been widely explored. The GPS/INS 
integrated navigation system, typically carried out through 
the extended Kalman filter (EKF), is the adequate solution to 
provide a navigation system that has superior performance in 
comparison with either GPS or INS stand-alone system.  
One of the most important issues in GPS system 
performance improvement is the interference suppression 
techniques. Most of the conventional approach for code 
synchronization process employs the delay-locked-loop 
(DLL) structure. The conventional DLL loop uses a 
discriminator function constructed with a specific 
combination of its early, prompt, and late correlator to detect 
code tracking error. 
The Kalman filter (Brown and Hwang, 1997; Gelb, 
1974; Grewal and Andrews, 2001; Lewis, 1986) is the most 
well known sequential data assimilation scheme for solving 
the Wiener problem in a generally easier way. It has been 
applied in the areas as diverse as aerospace, marine 
navigation, radar target tracking, control systems, 
manufacturing, and many others. A navigation filter is 
commonly designed by use of a Kalman filter to estimate the 
vehicle state variables and suppress the navigation 
measurement noise. The Kalman filter not only works well in 
 3
local linearization of the state vector by the EKF or UKF. 
Particle filter is a probability-based estimator. The Bayesian 
estimation is the foundation for particle filters.  Some 
versions of the PF proposed in the literature can be regarded 
as special case of the general SIS algorithm. If the true 
density is non-Gaussian, particle filters, may yield better 
performances in comparison to that of EKF or UKF. To 
improve the estimate accuracy, the EKF or UKF can be used 
to generate the true mean and covariance of the proposal 
distribution. 
The nonlinear filters naturally suffer the same problem 
as the EKF. The uncertainty of the process noise and 
measurement noise will degrade the performance. An 
adaptive mechanism which dynamically identifies 
uncertainties or modeling errors can be adopted. The 
so-called adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) approach (Mehra, 
1970, 1972; Mohamed and Schwarz, 1999; Hide et al., 2003) 
has been one of the promising strategies and has been widely 
explored for dynamically adjusting the parameters of the 
supposedly optimum filter based on the estimates of the 
unknown parameters for on-line estimation of motion as well 
as the signal and noise statistics available data. The AKF can 
be utilized as the noise-adaptive filter for tuning the noise 
covariance matrices. Adaptive filters are based on 
dynamically adjusting the parameters of the supposedly 
optimum filter based on the estimates of the unknown 
parameters. Adaptive Kalman filters can be based on an 
on-line estimation of motion as well as the signal and noise 
statistics available data. The two major approaches that have 
been proposed for AKF are multiple model adaptive estimate 
(MMAE) and innovation adaptive estimation (IAE). The 
innovation sequences have been utilized by the correlation 
and covariance-matching techniques to estimate the noise 
covariances. The basic idea behind the covariance-matching 
approach is to make the actual value of the covariance of the 
residual consistent with its theoretical value.  
The IMM estimator is proposed by Bar-Shalom and Blom. 
The interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm (Li and 
Bar-shalom 1993a; 1993b) has the configuration that runs in 
parallel several model-matched state estimation filters, which 
exchange information (interact) at each sampling time. The 
IMM algorithm has been originally applied to target tracking 
(Kim and Hong 2004; Lee, et al. 2005; Li and Bar-shalom 
1993c), and recently extended to GPS navigation (Chen and 
Harigae 2001; Lin, et al. 2001). A model probability 
evaluator calculates the current probability of the vehicle 
being in each of the possible modes. A global estimate of the 
vehicle’s state is computed using the latest mode probabilities. 
This algorithm carries out a soft-switching between the 
various modes by adjusting the probabilities of each mode, 
which are used as weightings in the combined global state 
estimate. The covariance matrix associated with this 
combined estimate takes into account the covariances of the 
mode-conditioned estimates as well as the differences 
between these estimates. The AKF approach is based on 
parametric adaptation, while the IMM approach is based on 
filter structural adaptation (model switching). In the IMM 
approach, multiple models are developed to describe various 
dynamic behaviors. In each model a filter is running, and the 
IMM algorithm makes uses of model probabilities to weight 
the inputs and output of a bank of parallel filters at each time 
instant. 
The interacting multiple model (IMM) nonlinear filters 
with application to navigation sensor fusion has been 
conducted. Performance evaluation for various single-model 
nonlinear filters as well as nonlinear filters with IMM 
framework is carried out. The example on loosely-coupled 
GPS/INS integrated navigation processing based on the 
IMM-nonlinear filters will be presented. Performance 
improvement will be assessed using the IMM-nonlinear filter 
methods as compared to the single filter approaches.

where ),|( 1 kkkq zxx − is the importance density function, 
1−kw  are the importance weights of the previous epoch 
particles and kw  are the importance weights of the current 
epoch. This use of transition prior distribution as the 
importance distribution greatly simplifies weight calculations, 
which makes it an attractive choice. However in doing so, the 
weights depend only on the current state vector and the 
observation, i.e. the likelihood function. After a few iterations, 
most samples have negligible weights as information coming 
from the latest measurement is completely ignored. In order 
to reduce this problem, a resampling step is incorporated into 
the SIS PF, leading to the formation of the SIR PF. 
Nevertheless, the resampling step at every time epoch can 
easily lead to sample impoverishment.  
 
D. The extended Kalman particle filter and unscented 
particle filter. In the extended particle filter (EPF), the other 
filter is used for the importance proposal generation. The 
extended Kalman particle filtering (EKPF) is formed when 
the UKF is used for the importance proposal generation; the 
unscented particle filter (UPF) is formed when the UKF is 
used for the importance proposal generation. To improve the 
estimate accuracy, the EKF or UKF can be used to generate 
the true mean and covariance of the proposal distribution. In 
a local linearization technique, such as the EKPF and UPF, 
each particle is drawn from the local Gaussian approximation 
of the optimal importance distribution ),|( 1 kkkp zxx −  that is 
conditioned on the current state and the latest measurement, 
as given in equation: 
)|(),|( Optimal1 kkNkkk qzq Zxxx =−       (29) 
where Nq  denotes the Gaussian approximation of 
importance density and is obtained from EKF/UKF.  
An improvement in the choice of proposal distribution 
over the simple transition prior, which also the problem of 
sample depletion, can be accomplished by moving particles 
towards the regions of high likelihood, based on the most 
recent measurement. An effective approach to accomplish 
this, is to use an EKF or UKF generated Gaussian 
approximation optimal proposal by Julier and Uhlmann(1996) 
et al. (1995, 2000). That is,

k Nq Pxzxxx ≅−          (30) 
where ikx and ikP  are the mean and covariance of the ith 
particle generated by the EKF/UKF, respectively. This is 
accomplished by using a separated EKF or UKF to generate 
and propagate a Gaussian proposal distribution for each 
particle. At time k one uses the EKF/UKF equations to 
compute the mean and covariance of the importance 
distribution for each particle from the just previous time step. 
Next, we redraw the i th particle (at time step k) from this 
new updated distribution. While still making a Gaussian 
assumption, the approach provides a better approximation to 
the optimal conditional proposal distribution. A large number 
of samples are effectively removed from the sample set 
because their importance weights become numerically 
insignificant by residual resampling (Rudolph van der Merwe 
2000). 
One cycle of the EKPF/UPF (use EKF/UKF as 
proposal distribution) algorithm can be summarized as 
follows.

2. 採用交互多模型非線性濾波器於 GPS/INS 導航系統之
設計  
The relation between various nonlinear filters and the 
IMM nonlinear filters is shown in Figure 2. To deal with 
noise uncertainty and system nonlinearity simultaneously, the 
IMM-nonlinear filters can be introduced. Figure 3 describes 
the basis structure of the IMM estimator for an r model case. 
The estimator carries out a ‘soft switching’ among various 
modes by the mode probability of every mode. The 
measurements could be obtained from one or more sensors, 
and the mode-matched filters rjjM 1}{ =  could be linear or 
nonlinear. The overall estimates is obtained by a combination 
of the estimates from the filters running in parallel based on 
the individual models that match the system modes. In each

Suppose the mean x  and covariance P  of vector x  
are known, a set of deterministic vector called sigma points 
can then be found. The ensemble mean and covariance of the 
sigma points are equal to x  and P . The nonlinear function 
)(xy f=  is applied to each deterministic vector to obtain 
transformed vectors. The ensemble mean and covariance of 
the transformed vectors will give a good estimate of the true 
mean and covariance of y , which is the key to the 
unscented transformation. The UKF approach estimates are 
expected to be closer to the true values than the EKF 
approach. One cycle of the IMM-UKF are similar to that of 
the IMM-EKF except that Stage 2 are replaced by

C. IMM-EPF. The extended particle filter with IMM 
framework yields the IMM-EPF. Two architectures 
MM-EKPF and IMM-UPF are presented. The IMM-PF is a 
combination of the traditional IMM estimator and a particle 
filter. Integrating a bank of extended Kalman particle filters 
with the IMM method, an IMM-EKPF is obtained, while 
integrating a bank of unscented particle filters with the IMM 
method, an IMM-UPF is obtained. One cycle of the IMM-PF 
(either MM-EKPF or IMM-UPF) is similar to that of the 
IMM-EKF or IMM-UKF except that Stage 2 is replaced by 
the particle filters (EKPF or UPF). 
 
3. 非線性濾波器於 GPS 接收機電碼追蹤迴路之設計 
 
Typical GPS receivers use an omni-directional antenna 
to receive the right-hand polarized, circular GPS signals. 
These are passed through a band-pass filter and low noise 
amplifier before being down-converted to an intermediate 
frequency (IF) by a mixer. Many GPS receivers use two 
down-conversions to reach baseband, where the analog signal 
is sampled and converted into digital in-phase and quadrature 
channels by multiplication by sine and cosine versions of the 
local oscillator (mixing) frequency.  As receiver technology 
improves, fewer down-conversions will be required. Some 
receivers sample at an intermediate frequency, before 
down-converting to baseband, as shown in Figure 4.

The purpose of code tracking loop is to estimate the 
delay time between satellite and user, it is usually referred to 
as the delay lock loop (DLL). The DLL compares the 
incoming spreading code with three different phase versions 
of the code (early, prompt, and late). Multipath is one of the 
dominant error sources in the GPS positioning. The tracking 
loop using the extended Kalman filter with multiple 
correlator structure has been proposed by Jee et al. In the 
research, the dynamics of the signal parameters is assumed to 
take a linear system model, while the correlator accumulator 
measurements are nonlinear in the signal parameters, 
therefore a nonlinear filter needs to be employed. The EKF 
based DLL tracking loop with multipath mitigation capability 
was presented. The filter, which can separate LOS 
components from the multipath components by modeling and 
estimating the parameters of each signal component, is 
employed to estimate both the LOS and multipath signal 
components. The structure of the tracking loop is comprised 
of several branches of correlators followed by accumulator. 
These branch outputs are fed into an estimator, which jointly 
estimates the various signal parameters: amplitude, phase and 
delays.  
The outputs of these correlator branches are samples of 
the autocorrelation function of the spreading pseudorandom 
noise sequence and sinc function of Doppler frequency and 
phase error. The structure resembles the classical DLL in that

Assume that the differential GPS (DGPS) mode is used 
and most of the errors can be corrected, but the multipath and 
receiver thermal noise cannot be eliminated. The

spectral amplitudes that drive the random walk position states

trajectory.. The trajectory can be divided mainly into six 
intervals (or segments) according their dynamic 
characteristics. The six segments which represent the 
trajectories in the six intervals are indicated on the figure. 
The simulation scenario and design parameters are given as 
follows. 100 particles were used whenever the particle filter 
(either EKPF or UPF) is used. In most of the real driving 
situations, it is not possible to know in advance which kind of 
maneuvers will be performed. Therefore, for the two models

Simulation tests have been carried out to evaluate the 
estimation performance for the UKF approach in comparison 
with the EKF approach. The amplitude, delay and phase of 
the direct and the reflected signal components are estimated 
by the filter. The initial state for the signal is given by 
[ ]Tk ππ 5.05.025.015.02 −≡x . The parameters for 
the UKF are given by: 31 −= eα ; 2=β ; 0=γ . Comparison 
of the estimation results for the LOS signal components 0A , 
0τ , f  and 0φ , using the EKF and UKF is shown in Figure 
11; Comparison of the estimation results for the multipath 
components 1A , α  and 1φ , using the EKF and UKF is 
shown in Figure 12. The results show that the UKF approach 
can substantially improve the tracking performance as 
compared to that of conventional EKF method. To provide 
further information, some gain trajectories for EKF and UKF 
are shown in Figure 13. Only the gains iiK , 41K=i , are 
illustrated to show the tracking capability for the code 
tracking loop based on the EKF and UKF designs.

五、計畫成果自評 
本年度規劃自適應非線性濾波理論之探討及其於導
航系統之設計，應用了整合式 GPS/INS 導航系統非線性濾
波器及交互多模型非線性濾波器之探討及設計以及非線
性濾波器於 GPS 接收機電碼追蹤迴路之設計。本研究之
方法，採用非線性濾波，並配合交互多模型理論架構之實
現。計畫之成果，涵蓋了實現(1) 交互多模型非線性濾波
器於 GPS/INS 導航系統之設計，及(2) 非線性濾波器於
GPS 接收機電碼追蹤迴路之設計，有助於系統性能之提
昇。 
參與工作人員利用了整合導航擴展型卡爾曼濾波器
(EKF)，分析了交互多模型(IMM)非線性濾波器在整合導
航之解算之優勢。藉由非線性濾波器可有效地處理導航之
非線性問題，由於無需對系統模型進行線性化的動作，避
免了傳統 EKF 線性化之後引入的誤差。利用交互多模型
估測架構，可進一步地解決系統動態之不確定性。非線性
濾波器之選擇，除了擴展型卡爾曼濾波器之外，亦包含了
無跡卡爾曼濾波器(UKF)，卡爾曼粒子濾波器(EKPF)，以
及無跡粒子濾波器(UPF)。在幾種 GPS/INS 整合導航濾波
器中，無跡粒子濾波器在交互多模型的架構下，對於載體
動態之追蹤能力與導航狀態估測之準確度，有良好之性能
表現。 
其次，多路徑效應就是 GPS 接收訊號中最主要的誤
差來源之ㄧ，對於一般接收機傳統電碼同步化的過程中，
最常使用的方法是延時鎖定迴路(DLL)的架構，而傳統延
時鎖定迴路當中之電碼時間差偵測器，是由本地端所產生
的領先、準時及落後之電碼，再與接收訊號做積分相關運
算所得到電碼時間的偏移量，以方便電碼之追蹤。本研究
以無跡卡爾曼濾波器設計 GPS 接收機電碼追蹤迴路，比
較了擴展型卡爾曼濾波器與無跡卡爾曼濾波器於接收機
追蹤迴路中估測訊號之參數值、誤差量以及多路徑項，進
而減緩嚴重的多路徑效應時所造成的追蹤迴路失鎖問題。 
參與工作人員掌握了更深入之濾波理論及導航相關
議題設計之可行性與優勢，強化了多感測器導航系統設計
之基礎。研究成果對於未來從事各類導航系統之開發與設

非線性濾波器於 GPS 接收機電碼追蹤迴路之設計，有助於系統性能之提

技術(1)說明:應用擴展型卡爾曼濾波器於導航訊息處理已受到普遍之採
用。傳統之擴展型卡爾曼濾波器之求取系統方程式與量測方程式之
Jacobian 矩陣，使其成為一次佳(suboptimal)之濾波器。本技術採用非線
性濾波，以及交互多模型非線性濾波器理論於導航之系統之設計。採用
非線性濾波器，由於無需對系統模型進行線性化的動作，避免了傳統擴
展型卡爾曼濾波器線性化之後引入的誤差，可提升進一步之性能。採用
交互多模型(interacting multiple model，IMM)非線性濾波器，即時估計並
調整濾波器內部之系統數學模型與雜訊強度，可進一步地解決系統動態
之不確定性，有效地處理導航之非線性問題。非線性濾波器之選擇，除
了擴展型卡爾曼濾波器之外，亦包含了無跡卡爾曼濾波器(unscented 
Kalman filter，UKF)，卡爾曼粒子濾波器(extended Kalman particle filters，
EKPF)，以及無跡粒子濾波器(unscented particle filters，UPF)。 
 
技術(2) 說明:多路徑效應是 GPS 接收訊號中最主要的誤差來源之ㄧ。對
於一般接收機傳統電碼同步化的過程中，最常使用的方法是延時鎖定迴
路(DLL)的架構。而傳統延時鎖定迴路當中之電碼時間差偵測器，是由本
地端所產生的領先、準時及落後之電碼，再與接收訊號做積分相關運算
所得到電碼時間的偏移量，以方便電碼之追蹤。本技術以非線性濾波器
設計 GPS 接收機電碼追蹤迴路，比較了擴展型卡爾曼濾波器與無跡卡爾
曼濾波器於接收機追蹤迴路中估測訊號之參數值、誤差量以及多路徑
項，進而減緩嚴重的多路徑效應時所造成的追蹤迴路失鎖問題。
