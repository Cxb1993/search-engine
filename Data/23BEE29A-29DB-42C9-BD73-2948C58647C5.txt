stem cells on these polymer substrates.
However, in vitro cell culture system, several substances
ARTICLE IN PRESS
iomhave been used as either soluble factors or coated
substrates, which might exert different inﬂuences on the
behavior of cultured cells. For example, poly-D-lysine, the
most common coating substrate used for culture of CNS
neurons, had been demonstrated not only to enhance
neurite growth but also to improve better cell viability
[13–15]. But, when poly-D-lysine was suspended in the
medium, it was toxic and might result in cell death [16].
Moreover, J1/tenascin-C in substrate-bound or soluble
form displays contrary effects on neurite outgrowth of
hippocampal neurons [17]. J1/tenascin promotes neurite
outgrowth and elongation when used as substrates, but
that it inhibits neurite extension when added to the culture
medium in soluble form. Hence, the aim of this study is to
investigate the effects of FBS in either substrate-coated or
soluble form on the morphological differentiation and fate
determination of embryonic rat cerebral cortical stem cells
on EVAL and PVA polymer substrates at neurosphere
level. It was found that not only the properties of
substrates could exert different effects on the fate of
neurospheres but also the FBS in substrate-coated and/or
soluble form acting in different fashions could profoundly
inﬂuence the morphological differentiation and fate deter-
mination of CNS neural stem cells on EVAL and PVA
substrates. This information should be useful for the
development of biomaterials and characterization of the
roles of serum to regulate the proliferation and differentia-
tion of neural stem cells and their eventual manipulation to
replace lost or dysfunctional neurons following trauma or
disease.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of membranes
EVAL (E105A, Kuraray, Japan, containing ca. 56mole% vinyl
alcohol) and PVA (BF-17, Chang Chun, Taiwan) membranes were
prepared by using the dry process of the phase inversion method [18].
Circular membranes (1.5 cm in diameter) suitably sized for cell culture
wells were cut from the prepared membranes, sterilized with 70% alcohol
under ultraviolet light overnight and then rinsed extensively with
phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Subsequently, membranes were placed
in 24-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates (Corning, New York,ﬂuoride) (PVDF), and lysine-alanine sequential (LAS)
polymer substrates, they all displayed very low viability
under serum-free conditions [11,12]. Hence, in this study,
fetal bovine serum (FBS) was initially conducted to the
culture system to improve better viability of differentiated
neural stem cells on EVAL or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
polymer substrates. However, although the viability of
cortical neurospheres on EVAL or PVA substrates was
improved, it is found that FBS in soluble form has a
distinctive effect on the differentiation of cortical neural

Cortical neural stem cells were prepared from pregnant Wistar rat
embryos on day 14–15 according to a protocol detailed previously [8,9].
Brieﬂy, rat embryonic cerebral cortices were dissected, cut into small
pieces and mechanically triturated in cold Hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS) containing 0.4 g/l KCl, 0.09 g/l Na2HPO4  7H2O, 0.06 g/l
KH2PO4, 0.35 g/l NaHCO3, 0.14 g/l CaCl2, 0.10 g/l MgCl2  6H2O,
0.10 g/l MgSO4  7H2O, 8.0 g/l NaCl, and 1.0 g/l D-glucose in deionized
water. The dissociated cells were collected by centrifugation and were
resuspended in a serum-free medium (SFM) containing DMEM-F12,
8mM glucose, glutamine, 20mM sodium bicarbonate, 15mM HEPES and
N2 supplement (25mg/ml insulin, 100mg/ml human apotransferri, 20 nM
progesterone, 30 nM sodium selenite, pH 7.2) [19]. The number of live cells
was counted by trypan blue exclusion assay in a hemocytometer.
Cerebral cortical neural stem cells were puriﬁed and cultured in T25
culture ﬂasks (Corning, New York, USA) at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in
the above culture medium in the presence of bFGF at a concentration of
20ng/ml. Cultures were maintained at 37 1C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of
95% air/5%CO2. After 1–3 days in vitro, cells were undergoing cell division
and the proliferating cells formed clusters of cells, termed neurospheres,
which were suspended in the medium. Subsequently, adherent cells were
discarded and suspended neurospheres were collected by centrifugation,
mechanically dissociated and subcultured as single cells in a new T25 culture
ﬂask at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in the fresh culture medium containing
the same concentration of bFGF. These cells grew into new spheres in the
subsequent 2–3 days, that is, single cells proliferated and formed new
neurospheres. The procedure of subculture was repeated again to achieve
the puriﬁed cortical neural stem cells and proliferating neurospheres. The
plasticity of these puriﬁed cortical neural stem cells was identiﬁed by the
method of immunocytochemistry with anti-nestin, anti-NSE, and anti-
GFAP, which has been reported in a previous publication [10].
2.3. Preparation of FBS-coated substrates
Before neurospheres were seeded, sterile EVAL and PVA substrates
were precoated with 1ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated
for 24 h, after which time excess solution was removed by suction and the
substrates were dried for another hour.
2.4. Immunocytochemistry
For immunocytochemical characterization, cultured cells were ﬁxed in
ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20min and washed three times
in PBS at indicated time points. After ﬁxing, cells were incubated with
primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.3% triton-X-100 and 10%
bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 1C. The primary antibodies and their
dilution used in this study were mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein
2 polyclonal antibody (anti-MAP2; 1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA),
rabbit anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein polyclonal antibody (anti-GFAP;
1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) [20–22]. FITC- and Rhodamine-
conjugated secondary antibodies were used to visualize the signal by
reacting with cells for 30min at room temperature. The secondary
antibodies and their dilution were FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
IgG (preabsorbed with rabbit and rat serum protein; 1:100; Chemicon,
Temecula, CA) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (pre-
absorbed with rabbit and rat serum protein; 1:100; Chemicon, Temecula,
CA). Cells were also counterstained with DAPI. These immunostained
cells were visualized by indirect ﬂuorescence under the ﬂuorescent
microscope (Axiovert 100TV, Germany).

ﬁbrous astrocytes on FC PVA substrates (94.6%).
However, only a small proportion of the cells were not
stained by any of the used markers.
3.3. Behavior of neurospheres on EVAL and PVA substrates
in the medium containing 10% FBS
Subsequently, neurospheres were cultured on EVAL and
PVA substrates at the same neurosphere density in the
medium containing 10% FBS (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the
morphology of these differentiated cells grown on EVAL
and PVA substrates in the presence of soluble FBS was
dramatically different from that grown in the SFM. It is
found that, after 3 d of incubation, neurospheres have also
attached onto EVAL substrates and several cells have
migrated out far away from the neurospheres (Fig. 3(a)).
The neurosphere-forming cells on EVAL substrates were
induced into typically an extensive cellular substratum of
protoplasmic cells upon which few process-bearing cells
spread. The protoplasmic cells, exhibiting large, ﬂat cell
bodies with very few processes, would migrate far away
from the neurospheres and were characterized as MAP2/

examined. Fig. 4 shows that when soluble FBS was present,
neurospheres displayed similar morphological differentia-
tion and showed no signiﬁcant difference in differentiated
cell phenotypes on these two FC substrates. It can be
observed that, after 3 d of incubation, the original
boundary of neurospheres could not be clearly delineated
on both FC EVAL and PVA substrates (Fig. 4(a) and (e)).

4. Discussion
The factors responsible for proliferation and differentia-
tion of neural stem cells include extrinsic signals coming
from culture substrates [2,25], soluble factors [4–8,26], and
several complex interactions among cells [9,10]. The results
of this study show that the combinations of EVAL and
PVA substrates with substrate-coated and/or soluble serum
components have different effects on the morphological
differentiation, fate determination and migration patterns
of neural stem cells. About the effects of substrates,
substrate-coated and soluble serum components on the
differentiation potential of neural stem cells, four models
of regulatory mechanism were proposed and schemed in
Fig. 6.
For the ﬁrst case shown in Fig. 6(a), when both
substrate-coated and soluble FBS were not present in the
culture system, the fate and behavior of neurospheres were
mediated mainly by the substrates used. It is reasonable to
assume that neural stem cells may respond to differentsubstrates, and their fate determination depends on the
surface properties of the substrates [10,12]. In this study,
due to the distinctive nature properties of EVAL and PVA
substrates, EVAL substrates contain both hydrophilic
vinyl alcohol segments and hydrophobic ethylene segments
while PVA substrates have only hydrophilic segments,
different fate determinations of neurospheres were ob-
served on these two substrates. Additionally, our previous
published results have also suggested that, under the same
culture conditions, poly-D-lysine and LAS polymer sub-
strates exert different inﬂuences on the behavior and fate
determination of cortical neurospheres [12]. These results
indicating that neural stem cells would choice their fate
based on different substrates.
However, when FBS was introduced to the above culture
system in either substrate-coated or soluble form, different
differentiation outcomes of neurospheres were observed on
EVAL and PVA substrates. As shown in Fig. 6(b), when
the serum components were present in substrate-coated

aterials 27 (2006) 5901–5908form, the determinants of the behavior of neural stem cells
are substrate-coated serum combined with the substrates
used. Under the activation triggered by the substrate-
coated FBS, neurosphere-forming cells were induced to
differentiate into process-bearing cells predominantly.
Previous studies have demonstrates that substrate-coated
ECM could improve better neuronal adherence and
process outgrowth [17,27,28], and since the complicated
components of serum include adhesion factors, peptides,
essential nutrients, and hormones [29,30]; hence, we
proposed that these substrate-coated FBS components
above EVAL and PVA substrates might support as an
architecture layer for neurosphere adhesion and process
outgrowth. Nevertheless, the differentiated cell phenotypes
were dissimilar on EVAL and PVA substrates. While the
neurosphere-forming cells were differentiated into both
neurons and astrocytes on FC EVAL substrates, most of
neurosphere-forming cells (94.6%) were induced to
differentiate into ﬁbrous astrocytes on FC PVA substrates.
Indeed, our previous studies have demonstrated that PVA
