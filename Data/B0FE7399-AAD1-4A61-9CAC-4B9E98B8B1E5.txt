to other electric machines, switched-reluctance machine 
(SRM) can also be operated as a generator with suited 
commutation instant setting. And compared to the existing 
commonly used generators, the SRG has the potential to 
serve as a wind or micro-turbine driven power source. 
Hence, this project is motivated to develop a SRG with 
robust generated voltage characteristics, and to explore its 
application occasions, especially the distributed power and 
micro-grid systems.  
1.2 Survey of Fundamental Affairs 
A. Fundamentals of Switched-Reluctance Machines 
Each type of electric machine can be operated as a 
motor or a generator via proper operation control. For 
switched-reluctance machine [1-6] shown in Fig. 1, it can 
be operated as a motor and a generator by setting the 
winding current at suited rotor position in accordance with 
the winding inductance profile. Among the commonly 
used machines, the switched-reluctance machine possesses 
many comparative merits [1-6], such as: (i) No conductors 
and permanent-magnets are equipped on rotor, this makes 
it have rigid structure and high efficiency, easy to start for 
the absence of cogging torque, suitable applications in 
high temperature demanding environment and high speed 
driving, etc.; (ii) The concentrated stator windings are easy 
to form, having less copper loss and thermal resistance; 
and (iii) Its converter is simple and free from leg 
feed-through short. Hence the application capability of 
SRM has been gradually increased. As indicated in Fig. 2, 
the typical applications include electric vehicles [7-9], 
integrated starter/generators [10-12], micro-turbine driven 
generator [13], flywheel driven motor/generator [14], 
wind generator for autonomous loads [15-17] and 
grid-connected systems [19-20], etc. Specifically speaking, 
the cogging torque free and robust mechanically structural 
features make SRG be suited to serve as a variable wind 
generator, particularly for the offshore wind farm 
applications.  
However, the doubly-salient machine structure renders 
switched-reluctance machine to have the major drawbacks 
of higher torque ripple, higher generating voltage and 
power ripples [17], vibration and acoustic noise. Moreover, 
the nonlinear inductance profile leads to the nonlinear 
developed torque and the difficulty in making dynamic 
control. As for a SRG, its winding current control behavior 
is significantly affected by the effects of back-EMF. 
During the past decades, a lot of researches have been 
conducted from various aspects to enhance the driving 
performances of SRM operated as a motor and a generator. 
As far as the machine design is concerned, some 
researches have been conducted for motors [21-23] and 
generators [13,24-26]. In [25,26], the low speed SRGs are 
developed and used as a direct-driven wind generator.

The converter with proper switching control is the key 
constituted component for a switched-reluctance machine. 
There have been many existing SRM converters, the 
typical ones can be found in [27-32]. Their classifications 
can be made according to the switch number, operating 
quadrant and PWM switching control flexibility. Roughly 
speaking, the commonly used SRM converters can be 
classified as: (i) Standard asymmetric half-bridge 
converter [1-3,27,28] with N2  ( =N phase number) 
switches, which possesses the most PWM switching 
control flexibility; (ii) Modified Miller converters 
[1,2,29-31] with 2( 1+n ) ( 2/Nn = , N = even = phase 
number) switches, it has the best compromised features in 
switch number and PWM function; (iii) Miller converter, 
it is the simplest one, since only ( 1+N ) switches are 
employed. However, the PWM switching ability is limited 
under higher speed; (iv) Converters with energy recovery 
capability, such as the one in [30], and the C-dump 
converters and their modifications [31-32]; (v) Converter 
with boostable DC-link voltage; and (vi) Soft-switching 
converters. The proper choice is dependent on the specific 
applications.  
The most commonly used converter for switched 
reluctance machine is the classical half-bridge converter 
shown in Fig. 3(a), particularly for generation applications, 
This circuit possesses the most flexible PWM switching 
ability subject to having more circuit components, i.e., two 
power switches and two diodes per phase. In normal 
motor driving application, the lower switch is in charge of 
commutation, and the upper one is used to perform PWM 
switching control. The schematic and current paths 
corresponding to three operation modes are indicated in 
4 
employed for conditioning the feedback signal to lessen 
the effects of voltage ripples. In winding current control, 
many researches have been conducted. Roughly speaking, 
while the current regulation control is achievable below 
base speed [64,69], the commutation shift approach should 
be employed under higher speeds and heavier loads 
[64,70-73]. In [66], the turn-on and turn-off angles are 
continuously adjusted to successfully regulate the 
generator output voltage under varying loads. However, no 
dynamic performance is observed. In the study of [70], the 
turn-on and conduction angles under all speeds are 
determined based on finite element simulation results. 
Obviously, the control results will be sensitive to the 
variations of operating conditions and system parameters.  
In order to reduce the effects of parameter variations, 
some researches [71,72] are emphasized on the use of 
fuzzy control to determine the control angles. In [71], the 
dwell angle is determined using fuzzy algorithm to make 
voltage regulation. As to [72], under fixed optimal turn-off 
angle, the generator output power is controlled by 
regulating the turn-on angle using fuzzy control. In the 
recent research presented in [73], the turn-on and turn-off 
angles are online determined using the experimentally 
determined controller parameter without requiring the 
SRG magnetization curves. The pursued performances are 
maximum efficiency and reduced torque ripples under 
single-pulse mode. In [74], the optimal turn-off angle is 
first determined from the fitted curve expressed as a 
function of power and speed, then the turn-on angle is 
controlled to regulate the generating power. In [75], under 
chopping current mode with delta PWM control, the 
optimal turn-on and turn-off angles are on-line determined 
using simple formulas to yield compromised performance 
in high-efficiency and low torque ripple. However, the 
control for single-pulse mode is not considered. In [76], an 
iterative search for characterizing SRG in terms of design 
parameters and control variables is proposed. Specifically, 
the researches indicate that at each DC-link voltage level 
and speed, a pair of turn-on and turn-off angles can be 
found. Similarly, no dynamic control and performance are 
presented. The system modeling and control schemes of a 
SRG followed by three-phase inverter under varying speed 
driven by wind turbine are presented in [84]. Its power 
tracking capability under varying wind speeds is verified. 
Moreover, it is also proved that the tripping of SRG during 
system fault is not required via the proposed fault 
hysteresis control scheme. In [85], the system parameters, 
such as speed and excitation voltage, affecting the SRG 
output power and voltage are explored. Experimental and 
simulation results are shown to demonstrate the suitable 
excitation control for a wind powered SRG. Recently, the 
position sensorless control of a variable speed SRG is 
studied in [79]. The rotor position is obtained from the 
estimated unsaturated instantaneous inductance by using 
reduced size neural network.  
The major contribution of this project is to develop a 
SRG with robust and well-regulated output voltage [80]. 
For convenience of conducting experimental work in an 
academic laboratory, the prime mover of SRG is replaced 
by an inverter-fed induction motor drive. 
C. Micro-Grid System 
Micro-grid [81-93] belongs to a small power system 
constructed by distributed and renewable generators, it can 
be operated independently from or connected to the 
conventional bulk power system. As known that the use of 
micro-grid may have many advantages, such as lower 
energy cost, higher reliability and power quality, improved 
energy utilization efficiency, and reducing emissions, etc. 
And recently, the studies [81-93] concerning micro-grid 
system have received much attention world wide. In [86], 
the micro-grid demonstration projects in Japan are 
introduced and overviewed. These practical projects can 
offer the experimental experiences for the countries which 
are willing to construct new energy system. 
Micro-grid can be classified into common AC bus, 
common DC bus and high- frequency AC bus types. For 
any type of micro-grid, it can be paralleled to the utility 
grid by suited interface converter or inverter through 
synchronization process. For the first type, the AC loads 
can be directly linked to the micro-grid without interface 
inverters. Conversely, in DC micro-grid [84-87], various 
DC generating sources and storage sources are easily 
connected to the common DC bus using DC/DC 
converters. Fig. 4 shows the typical configuration of a 
micro-grid system with common DC bus.

common DC bus. 
 
Having established a micro-grid system, the energy 
management control and fault protection will be the major 
issues in running operation. Some researches [90-93] are 
focused on the control affairs and the stability analysis for 
micro-grid systems. The systematic approach for the 
design and analysis of a supervisory hybrid control 
scheme is proposed in [90]. Both grid-connected and 
isolated modes are treated, and the supervisory hybrid 
controls for wind energy conversion and storage system 
are presented. In [91], a micro-grid with three wire DC 
distribution line is devised, and the proper DC voltage 
control is made to obtain balanced voltage and high 
supplying power quality. In [92], the specific voltage 
source converters for micro-grid are developed. The 
balanced current control is treated in addition to real and 
reactive power control. For the micro-grid system with 
wind power generation, its stability analyses under both 
small and large disturbances are studied in [93]. The 
fluctuation of wind speed is modeled using Weibull 
distribution, and the effectiveness is verified by simulation 
using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. 
Wind generator [94-99] is one of the most important 
energy sources in a micro-grid. Typically, the wind 
generator systems can be classified into three categories 
according to generator shaft speed: (i) fixed-speed; (ii) 
limited variable speed; and (iii) variable speed. Depending 
on the allowed shaft speed feature, the wind turbine type 
should be properly chosen, and the suited interface 
converters should be chosen and controlled [95,96].

2. Research Content (研究內容) 
In this project, an experimental DSP-based SRG drive 
is established. The necessary sensing schemes, interfacing 
circuits and digital control environment are properly 
constructed. The proper control considering the adverse 
effects is made. Some experimental results are provided to 
verify the correct operation of the established SRG system. 
Generally, the generated voltage of a SRG is not directly 
applicable for micro-grid system. Hence a suited followed 
boost DC/DC converter is needed. In addition, the 
galvanic isolation is required from the grid to the 
generator system. Hence, the CFPP converter is adopted 
here to establish a 400V DC common grid. Good voltage 
regulation performance is demonstrated experimentally. 
2.1. Governing Equations and Operation of SRG 
2.1.1 Structure and Operation of SRG 
Fig. 7(a) shows the configuration of a SRG drive, 
wherein the SRG is 4-phase with 8/6 teeth. Similar to a 
variable-reluctance stepping motor, SRG possesses the 
structure of doubly-salient and singly-excited structure. Its 
stator windings are excited by the converter with suitable 
commutation according to the sensed rotor absolute 
position. The winding currents are regulated via various 
kinds of PWM control approaches to yield the desired 
output voltage response. Owing to fluctuated winding 
current waveforms under varying operating conditions, the 
DC-linkage current will contain large spikes. Suitable 
design of output filtering capacitor is an effective means to 
reduce the voltage ripple components. 
2.1.2 Governing Equations 
In the derivation, some assumptions are given: (i) the 
SRG has been successfully excited and entered generation 
process with ideal square-wave winding current waveform; 
(ii) the nonlinear magnetic saturation and the inter-phase 
mutual coupling are neglected; (iii) the mechanical system 
losses and machine core losses are neglected. The air-gap 
power established by the prime mover and the phase 
winding current can be written from Fig. 7(b) as:

is a negative value for SRG, rrrre iLR ωθθω )/),(()( ∂∂Δ = 
equivalent energy conversion resistance. Obviously from 
(2), the back-EMF of a SRG is dependent on rotor speed 
as well as winding current like a series DC generator. 
According to (2), the per-phase equivalent circuit of a 
SRG can be drawn in Fig. 7(b). 
  In measuring the SRG winding inductance, the rotor of 
SRG is locked precisely at a specific position by a 
positioner. The phase winding is excited using constant 
current at Hzf 100= , by measuring the winding terminal 
voltage V and reactive power Q, and using E=0, one can 
obtain the estimated inductance )2/(),( 2 fQViL r πθ = . For 
the SRG employed in this project, its measured winding 
inductances at different current levels are plotted in Fig. 
7(c). From the measured winding inductance profiles, one 
can obtain the estimates of )( reR ω and back-EMF: 
Ω= 0.58 eR , Vie r 03.29),( =ω at( rpm6000=rω , Ai 50= )

(3) Mode 3 ( 43 ttt ≤< ): 
  ( 3Q , 4Q ) are turned off and ( 3D , 4D ) are conducted by 
hysteresis CCPWM control. It follows that 02 >= iid . 
The voltage equation is the same as (5) with 1i  being 
replaced by 2i .  
(4) Mode 4 ( 54 ttt ≤< ): 
  ( 3Q , 4Q ) are turned on again ( 3D , 4D  are off) to let 
02 <−= iid . The voltage equation is identical to (6). 
  In the remaining time interval ( 5tTst − ), the modes 3 
and 4 are repeatedly operated. 
Comments: 
(i)  Eqs. (5) and (6) show that the back-EMF ),( rie ω  
assists the increase of winding current during both 
magnetization and demagnetization periods.  
(ii)  If ),( rd iev ω> , the chopping current PWM control 
can be achievable via hard freewheeling. For the 
employed SRG, Vvd 42= and VrpmAe 03.29)6000,50( ≈ , 
the chopping control condition is met at this 
condition. Contrarily, the condition of ),( rd iev ω≤  
and the soft freewheeling may lead to single-pulse 
current mode without current regulating capability. 
(iii) Even the chopping control condition is satisfied, the 
stable current PWM switching control is still rather 
difficult to achieve owing to the nonlinear effects of 
back-EMF and winding inductance, and also the 
variations of operating condition and system 
parameters. The development of more robust current 
control is indispensable.  
(iv) In the waveform of di  shown in Fig. 8(a), the 
positive portions represent generation, while the 
negative ones denote winding excitation from 
DC-link. The form factor will be significantly larger 
than one for a given average DC-link current dI . 
Thus one must be careful in the choice of power 
converter devices. The large current ripples may also 
lead to the large DC-link voltage ripples. In this 
project, the design of power circuit components and 
the voltage feedback control considering the effects 
of DC-link ripple are studied. 
B. Single-Pulse Mode 
  In this case, 0=cT  and thus sst TT = . The waveform 
during cT  in Fig. 8(a) is absent to let the winding current 
become single-pulse mode. Some facts are worth noting: (i) 
the current may be fluctuated significantly with large 
peaks, and this is harmful for converter power 
semiconductor devices and motor windings; (ii) the 
frequencies of DC-link current and voltage ripples become 
lower (stoke frequency), and their magnitudes will be 
much higher; (iii) the voltage or power control can only be 
conducted via suitable commutation instant shift. The 
satisfactory control is difficult to achieve and the dynamic 
response will be sluggish. 
2.4. The Established SRG System 
The established experimental DSP-based SRG drive is 
shown in Fig. 9(a). It mainly consists of the following key 
components:  
y Switched-reluctance machine: 4-phase, 8/6, 48V, 2.3kW, 
6000rpm, manufactured by DENSI Company. The 
developed torque and power characteristics provided 
by the vendor are shown in the Appendix. 
y Converter: The classical asymmetric bridge converter 
is employed. The switches used in the converter are 
one of two transistors in the IGBT modules 
(Mitsubishi Electric CM100DU-12F, 600V, 100A 
continuous, 200A pulsed). And the freewheeling 
diodes are the anti-parallel diodes of another transistor 
in the same module. 
y Prime mover: An inverter-fed induction motor is 
utilized, whose ratings are: (i) three-phase squirrel  
cage induction motor: 220V, 3.7kW, 1500rpm (maximum 
speed = 8000rpm); (ii) inverter: three-phase input with 
AC 200-240V, 50/60Hz; three-phase output with 240V, 
0-400Hz, 6.9kVA. 
y Excitation source: eV =12V. 
y Control scheme: The control scheme shown in Fig. 
9(b) consists of an outer-loop voltage controller and 
an inner-loop current-controlled PWM scheme. The 
voltage loop and current command generator are 
realized using the DSP ADMC401 manufactured by 
Analog Devices. The hysteresis current control 
schemes are realized using analog circuits to yield 
satisfactory winding current tracking control under 
the adverse effects of back-EMF. The sampling rates 
are chosen to be 20kHz for current command 
generating mechanism and 5kHz for voltage control 
loop. And the redesign digital control is employed 
using bilinear transformation method. 
y The SRG converter commutation signals 41 ~ SS  are 
generated from the sensed Hall signals. As to the rotor 
absolute position detection, the sensed Hall signals 
),( BA HH  and the encoder signal EC are directly 
connected to the encoder interface in the ADMC401 
evaluation board. The encoder interface section 
consists of a 16-bit quadrature up/down counter and a 
16-bit EIUCNT register. The resolution of the 
employed encoder is 1024 pulses/rev, its resolution is 
increased by 4 times up to 4096 pulses/rev. 
Accordingly, the commutation shift count osN =1 
corresponds to the shift angle of 1/4096 degrees.

a load resistance change Ω→Ω= 13.16.1dR  at the condition of 
( WWPd 14941088 →= , VVd 42= ).  
 
(b) Dynamic Commutation Shift Control 
As the chopping PWM current control is failed to 
achieve at lower speed and/or heavier load, the voltage 
tracking error vε  can not be regulated to zero via 
voltage feedback control. In this case, commutation instant 
shift is the only way to make the voltage control. However, 
the existing commutation shift approaches are rather 
difficult to achieve satisfactory dynamic response. In this 
project, a dynamic shift controller (DSC) shown in Fig. 
9(b) is devised. The average value vε is obtained by a low 
pass filter )(sH LP . Then a dynamic commutation shift 
vPsos KN εδ =  is generated and employed for shifting the 
turn-on and turn-off angles simultaneously. The shift count 
osN =1 corresponds to the shift angle of 1/4096 degrees. 
The P-type dynamic control is adopted here to avoid the 
control effort saturation caused by the remaining tracking 
error, which can be eliminated by the feedback controller 
)(sGcv . The key parameters of the proposed DSC are set 
as: 
006.0)( == Pscs KsG , ssH sLP τ+= 1
1)( , 008.0
202
1 =×= πτ s  
(15) 
And a hysteresis comparator with a band of 0.2V is 
used for avoiding the spurious operation. It is worth noting 
that the proposed control scheme and methodology 
including DSC are all applicable to the SRGs with 
different number of phase. 
(c) Static Commutation Shift 
Under steady-state condition, a static shift scheme 
shown in Fig. 9(b) is utilized to adjust the commutation 
instant with an amount of osNΔ  for pursuing higher 
energy conversion efficiency. The experimental 
performance evaluation in this aspect will be presented in 
the next section. 
2.6. Performance Evaluation 
To let the SRG be more stably operated under varying 
driving speed, load and back-EMF, the turn-on and 
turn-off angles are preset at °−= 5onθ  and °=15offθ , 
respectively. The effectiveness and performance of the 
established SRG system controlled by the proposed 
approach are evaluated experimentally. The SRG 
efficiency is defined here as: 
4321 PPPP
Pd
+++=
Δη                         (16) 
where dP = generator output power, iP , 4,,1K=i = ith 
phase winding power. All these powers are measured 
using the digital power meter WT1030M manufactured by 
YOKOGAWA, Japan. 
At rotor speed rpmr 6000=ω  and Vvd 42=∗ , the 
measured output voltage dv  due to a step load power 
change of Ω→= 13.167.2dR  ( W1474W638 →=dP ) by 
the feedback controller without and with the augmentation 
of DSC are plotted in Fig. 12(a), and the measured 
steady-state dv , 1i  and ∗1i  at Ω= 13.1dR  ( WPd 1474= ) 
by these two control cases are shown in Fig. 12(b) 
( %7.77=η ) and 12(c) ( %0.78=η ). The results indicate 
that the voltage tracking errors can all be regulated to zero. 
The addition of DSC can yield better voltage regulation 
response with smaller dip and faster restoration, more 
steady output voltage waveform with smaller voltage 
ripple, and a slightly higher efficiency. These 
improvements are mainly due to the improved winding 
current waveform tracking control by applying the 
proposed DSC.

2.7 Redesign of the Developed SRG for Micro-Grid 
Application 
The established SRG presented in the previous section 
is emphasized on the feasibility study, and the output 
voltage VVd 42=  is set mainly for electric vehicle driving 
applications. For being a generating source in a micro-grid, 
the following system parameters are specified and the 
redesign is made accordingly: (i) output voltage VVd 48= , 
and (ii) filtering capacitor FCd μ51700= , which is larger 
than those adopted previously. This capacitor is formed by 
the parallel connection of two capacitors 1dC =47000 Fμ  
and 2dC =4700 Fμ with the following measured ESR: 
FCCC ddd μ51700// 21 ==  
=sR 15.58 Ωm /120Hz,14.26 Ωm /1kHz, 
13.43 Ωm /2.4kHz,13.26 Ωm /10kHz            (17) 
The output voltage ripple at the operating condition 
( rpmr 6000=ω , kHzfst 4.2= , VVd 48= , Ω= 8dR , WPd 291= , 
AId 4.6= ) can be found as:

The smaller ripple voltage may reduce its effects on the 
SRG generating power quality, and also the followed 
converter operations. More specifically, the higher 
controller gains can be set to yield improved dynamic 
responses.  
Following the same procedure presented previously, the 
dynamic model estimation of the redesigned SRG system 
with FCCC ddd μ51700// 21 ==  are made at the conditions: (i) 
rpmr 6000=ω , Ω= 67.2dR ; (ii) DSC is disabled; (iii) 
Vvd 48=∗ ; and (iv) ssKKsG IvPvcv 301)( +=+=  (temporarily 
set). The measured output voltage response due to a load 
resistance change Ω= 67.2dR  to Ω14.1  ( WPd 857= to 
W1890 ) is plotted in Fig. 16(a) (upper). By choosing three 
typical response points ( V0.3− , ms5.10 ), ( V0.6− , ms37 ) 
and ( V6.0− , ms170 ), the dynamic model parameters are 
estimated following the above procedure to be: 
plK =0.000599733, 113.33=a , 564.30=b         (19) 
 
The simulated voltage response at the same case is also 
plotted in the lower part of Fig. 16(a), which is very close 
to the measured one. 
 At the given operating point ( rpmr 6000=ω , Ω= 67.2dR , 
VVd 48= ), the regulation control specifications are 
defined as: dmvΔ =4.0V, ret =0.15s for a step load power 
change of WPd 1000=Δ . Following the proposed design 
process one can find the controller parameters are: 
PvK =2.11, IvK =52.00                     (20) 
The measured (upper) and simulated (lower) dv  due to a 
step load power change WPd 1033=Δ ( Ω= 67.2dR  to 
Ω14.1 , 48V, i.e., WPd 857=  to W1890 ) are compared in 
Fig. 16(b). The results indicate they are very close.

Having redesigned the proposed SRG system, its 
generating capability under varying driven speeds are 
further assessed. At the speed rpmr 6000=ω and Vvd 48=∗ , 
the measured output voltage dv  due to a step load 
resistance change Ω→= 14.167.2dR ( W1890W857 →=dP )  
by the feedback controller with the augmentation of DSC 
are plotted in Fig. 17(a), and the measured steady-state 
dv  and 1i  at Ω= 14.1dR  ( WPd 1890= ) are shown in 
Fig. 17(b) ( %8.73=η ).  
As the driven speed is reduced, from (2) one can be 
aware that the generated voltage will be decreased. Hence 
by setting Vvd 42=∗  at rpmr 4500=ω , the measured dv  
due to step load resistance change of ( Ω→= 14.16.1dR , 
W1399W1115 →=dP ) and steady-state characteristics at 
( Ω= 14.1dR , %7.64=η ) are respectively plotted in Figs. 
18(a) and 18(b). Now let the driving speed be further 
lowered to rpmr 3000=ω , and the voltage command is set 
as Vvd 32=∗ . The measured dv  due to a step load 
resistance change of ( Ω→= 24dR , W501W253 →=dP ) 
at ( rpmr 3000=ω , Vvd 32=∗ ) is shown in Fig. 19(a), and 
Fig. 19(b) depicts the measured steady-state dv  and 1i  
at ( Ω= 2dR , %4.71=η ). From the results in Figs. 17 to 19, 
one can observe the satisfactory generating performance 
of the developed SRG system under wide speed range by 
the designed )(sGcv  and DSC.

2.8.1 Operation Modes and Governing Equations 
The current-fed push-pull DC/DC converter is operated 
by the two main switches ),( 21 TT  being overlapped by 
sT5.0 , where sT  is the switching period. The duty ratio 
of each switch is set to be 5.0>D . By neglecting the two 
auxiliary switches ),( 43 TT  for active clamping, the 
current paths and equivalent circuits under two operating 
modes are shown in Fig. 24 (a) and (b). And the sketched 
key waveforms are shown in Fig. 25. Assumed that all 
circuit components are ideal, and the average values of 
dd Vv =  and dcdc Vv =  are used. The governing equations 
in DC analysis are derived as follows: 
(i) Magnetization mode: Two switches are ON 
When the main switches of the CFPP converter are 
both turned on, the energy storage inductor is magnetized 
from the source dv  as shown in Fig. 24(a): 
dt
diLVv LdL == , sTDt )5.0(0 −≤≤             (22) 
(ii) De-magnetization mode: One switch is OFF 
One of the main switches is turned off to let the 
inductor stored energy be transferred to output load. From 
Fig. 24(b), the circuit equation can be written as: 
dt

VVv LdcdL =−= , ss TtTD 5.0)5.0( ≤≤−     (23) 
where ps NNn /Δ  is the turn ratio of transformer. 
Using the voltage-time equal area property for a stable 
converter, the input-output voltage transfer ratio of the 
CFPP converter can be obtained from Fig. 25, (22) and (23)

AMOSENSE Cooperation is chosen. From its datasheet 
one can obtain 2320mmAe =  and T7.0T35.02 =×=ΔB , 
and then from (41):

According to (42) and avoiding the saturation of 
transformer flux, 6=pN and 24=sN are set. The AWG #12 
and AWG#18 wires are chosen for the two primary 
windings and the single secondary winding, respectively. 
2.8.3 Voltage Spike Reduction 
Although the CFPP converter is a better choice of 
isolated boost DC/DC converters, its switches suffer from 
large voltage spike problem due to the energy stored in the 
leakage inductance of push-pull transformer. To solve this 
problem, some improved circuits [109-110,114] and 
transformer winding method [109] have been proposed. 
A. Transformer Winding Method 
Since the leakage inductance of push-pull transformer 
will cause voltage spike over main switches, the improved 
transformer winding scheme is essential to the protection 
of over-voltage. First, the transformer is formed using 
traditional winding method shown in Fig. 26(a), its 
leakage inductance is measured to be kHz30/7.2 HLls μ= . 
Next, the sandwich winding strategy proposed in [109] is 
applied to wind the transformer with the configuration 
shown in Fig. 26(b). The measured leakage inductance 
becomes kHz30/565.0 HLls μ= , which is much more 
smaller than those of Fig. 26(a). 
B. Active Clamp Circuit 
To further reduce the voltage spike caused by the 
transformer leakage inductance, the active clamp circuit 
consisting of 3T , 4T  and aC shown in Fig. 23 is adopted 
in this project. The switching schemes of the active clamp 
switches 3T  and 4T  are simply set to be the 
complement of the main switches with dead-time std μ1= . 
The active clamp capacitor is chosen as V630/1.0 FCa μ= . 
C. Voltage Control Scheme and PWM Modulator 
(a) Voltage control scheme 
The voltage feedback controller shown in Fig. 23 is 
chosen to be the PI-type: 
ss
KKsG IPcv
2.205.1)( +=+=                 (43) 
which is implemented by OP amplifier based analog 
circuit. For reducing the switching ripples on the feedback 
control, the sensing scheme is set as )1()( sKsK vvv τ+= , 
with V/V0091.0=vK , =×= )16002/(1 πτv 0.0001. 
(b) PWM modulator 
As to the current-fed push-pull PWM switching scheme, 
the Motorola TL494 PWM IC is applied here. Naturally, 
the switching signals of the two main switches are 
overlapped by sT2/1  with the duty ratio being 5.0>D . 
And the active clamp switches are simply set to be the 
complement of the main switches.

with large leakage inductance; (b) improved method with small

2.8.4 Experimental Results 
A. CFPP Converter Stage 
The operating performance of the independent CFPP 
converter stage is first assessed. In making experiments, 
the commercialized DC source is employed and the 
resistive load is applied. The input voltage V48=dV  and 
output voltage V400=dcV  are set. The measured switch 
voltage 1Tv , DC-link voltage dcv  and inductor current 
Li  of the established CFPP DC/DC boost converter at 
Ω=156dcR  are shown in Fig. 27. The measured inductor 
ripple A4≈Δ Li , which is close to those listed in (37). The 
input power dP  and output power dcP  are measured by 
WT500 power analyzer (Yokogawa) to be W1085=dP , 
W1016=dcP , %63.93/ == ddc PPη . The results indicate 
that high efficiency and lower switch voltage spikes are 
obtained by the designed converter.

followed current-fed push-pull (CFPP) DC-DC converter 
and the battery energy storage system are drawn in Fig. 
34(a), and the ones for the 1P3W inverter are depicted in 
Fig. 34(b).  
In the proposed micro-grid system shown in Fig. 34(a), 
the SRG establishes a 48V DC-link (d1-d2) with good 
voltage regulation. A SRG with higher rated speed can be 
directly driven by micro-turbine, ISG or flywheel system. 
For low speed prime mover such as wind turbine, a 
speeding up gear box is normally equipped. Due to 
limitation of experimental conditions, an inverter-fed 
induction motor drive is employed as an alternative of 
prime mover. The SRG shaft driving speed can easily be 
adjusted from the inverter setting. However, faithful 
imitation of wind dynamic behavior for pursuing 
maximum power tracking should be considered in future 
research. Then a common 400V DC-grid (D1-D2) is 
formed from the SRG output using a compact CFPP 
DC-DC converter. It naturally possesses the capabilities of 
voltage boosting and galvanic isolation. As to the power 
quality control of the micro-grid system, the battery 
energy storage system is established to maintain the 
common DC bus voltage.  
As to the battery energy storage system shown in Fig. 
34(a), a battery bank (48V) is interfaced to the common 
400V DC-grid (D1-D2) by a bidirectional buck-boost 
converter. The battery bank can also be charged from the 
utility grid under long-term micro-grid system fault by an 
auxiliary charger constructed using the flyback SMR [123] 
with paralleled transformer for rating enlargement.  
For clear reference the variables of two DC-links are 
further summarized as: (i) 48V link: d1-d2, dd vC , ; (ii) 
400V link: D1-D2, dcdc vC , .

2.10.2 Battery Energy Storage System 
The proposed battery energy storage system is shown 
in Fig. 34(a), it consists of a battery bank with four serially 
connected batteries U1-36E-12 (12V, 36Ah, YUASA 
Company), a followed bidirectional buck-boost DC-DC 
converter, and a flyback SMR based auxiliary charger.  
A. Bidirectional Buck-Boost DC-DC Converter 
The power circuit and the control scheme of the 
proposed battery followed bidirectional buck-boost 
DC-DC converter are shown in Fig. 34(a). The two 
switches and two diodes in the proposed converter are 
realized using one IGBT module CM100DY-12H 
(Mitsubishi Company). Both buck-boost converter are 
designed to operate under CCM. The control scheme in 
both discharging and charging modes are all realized 
digitally using the DSP ADMC401, which is the same as 
those used in the SRG.  
The control schemes are arranged as: (i) discharging 
mode: outer voltage loop and inner current loop with 
ramp-comparison current-controlled PWM; and (ii) 
charging mode: the battery is initially charged under 
constant current mode with the charging current being set 
by the command ∗Lci  ( A6.10=∗Lci  for charging current 
of 9.5A). As the battery voltage is raised to 52V, the 
charging is changed to constant voltage floating charging 
mode. The analyses and designs of these two buck-boost 
converters employed in discharging and charging modes 
are presented as follows. 
(a) Discharging mode 
The buck-boost converter during discharging mode control 
is formed by the switch 1S  and the diode 2D  in Fig. 
34(a) and Fig. 35(a). For avoiding the contradicted 
operation between the two buck-boost converters, the 
switching signals 11 SCS ′=  is set with C  being a 
control signal ( C = “1” for discharging; C = “0” for 
charging). Some key waveforms under CCM are sketched 
in Fig. 35(b). Basic operation and analytic characteristics 
can be comprehended from the literatures, only specific 
features of this converter in the developed micro-grid are 
summarized here. The ideal circuit components are 
assumed in the following governing equations

Obviously, the chosen IGBT module is also appropriate 
for constructing the buck-boost converter in charging 
mode. 
 
y Control schemes: 
The control structure and the procedure for determining 
controller parameters are similar to those of discharging 
mode described above. The chosen voltage and current 
feedback controllers are listed below:

(c) Performance evaluation 
(i) Charging mode 
Let the battery bank be charged from the common 
DC-grid with A6.10=∗Lci  for the constant charging 
current of A5.9=bI , under a particular charging status, 
Fig. 36(a) shows the measured DC-link voltage dv  and 
phase-1 winding current 1i  of the SRG, and Fig. 36(b) 
depicts the measured switch voltage 2Sv , inductor current 
Li , battery charging current bi  and battery voltage bv . 
The measured key system variables at steady state are: (i) 
CFPP converter: V75.47=dV , W51.598=dP , V6.405=dcV , 
W52.533=dcP , %14.89/ == ddc PPη ; (ii) bidirectional 
buck-boost converter: W34.491=bP , V56.51=bV , 
A51.9=bI , %09.92/ == dcb PPη . The results of Figs. 36(a) 
and 36(b) indicate the normal charging operation of the 
developed energy storage system. 
(ii) Discharging mode 
As the fault of main power source occurs, the energy 
storage system can support the common DC bus voltage. 
The measured switch voltage 1Sv , diode voltage 2Dv  
and inductor current Li  of the buck-boost DC-DC 
converter when the battery bank discharge to the common 
DC-grid at ( V400=dcV , Ω= 160dcR ) are shown in Fig. 
37. The measured key system variables at steady-state are: 
kW153.1=bP , V16.49=bV , A45.23=bI , V86.392=dcV , 
W2.953=dcP , %67.82/ == bdc PPη . The measured steady- 
state characteristics of the buck-boost converter in 
discharging mode at different loads are listed in Table 1. 
As to the dynamic response, the measured common 
DC-grid voltage response due to a step load resistance 
change of Ω→Ω= 230280dcR ( W6.679W2.580 →=dcP ) 
is plotted in Fig. 38. From the experimental results in Fig. 
37, Fig. 38 and Table 1, one can be aware that the 
common DC bus is successfully supported with good 
voltage regulation by the energy storage system via the 
bidirectional buck-boost converter.

110V-voltage outputs. A master and a slave control 
schemes are respectively to handle the 220V and 110V 
output waveform controls.

The major system variables and components are listed 
as follows: 
y System voltages: the input and output voltages are set 
as: V,400=dcV Hz,60/V220=ABV Hz60/V110== BA VV . y Inverter output: totally 1000W. 
y Inverter circuit: it is constructed using the three-phase 
IGBT modules CM100RL-12NF (Mitsubishi Electric) 
( V,600 A(peak)200,A(DC)100 , Tj = 25°C). 
y Output filter: (i) inductor: it is wound on a toroidal 
core Micrometals T250-26 using the wireAWG#12. 
The measured inductances are ,Hz60/86.483 HLo μ=  
/18.481 Hμ ,1kHz kHz30/28.478 Hμ ; (ii) capacitor: 
VAC400/10 FCo μ= , the low-pass cutoff frequency 
can be found as == )2/(1 ooc CLf π Hz33.2301 , <Hz60 )Hz33.2301( =cf Hz30k< . y Isolated output voltage sensing scheme: the isolation 
amplifier AD202 (Analog Devices) is employed. 
y PWM modulator and control schemes: the 
voltage-mode bipolar sine PWM scheme with 
switching frequency kHz30=sf  is adopted. All the 
PWM and control schemes are realized in a DSP 
TMS320F28335 (Texas Instruments). The voltage loop 
control sampling rate is set as kHz30=vsf . y Loads: as shown in Fig. 34(b), linear load: resistor; 
nonlinear load: rectified and capacitive filtered resistor 
( V400/4700 FCL μ= ). 
B. Voltage Control Scheme 
As generally recognized, to yield high performance of 
an inverter-fed plant, the cascade control structure with 
inner current loop and outer voltage loop is usually 
adopted [113,114]. For simplifying the control mechanism, 
a robust voltage waveform control scheme for the 
developed inverter system without current loop is 
proposed as shown in Fig. 34(b). Its major features are 
introduced below: 
(a) Master DM control scheme 
The waveform control of ABv  generated by the outer 
two legs of IGBT module is handled by the master 
differential mode (DM) control scheme.  
(b) Slave CM control scheme 
The balance between the two voltages Av  and Bv  is 
regulated via the PWM switching for the center-leg IGBTs 
by the proposed master common mode (CM) control 
scheme indicated in Fig. 34(b). For saving the sensors, the 
physical voltage Bv′  is synthesized from the sensed ABv′  
and Av′  ( AABB vvv ′−′=′ ). Then AB vv ′=*  is used as a 
reference, and the voltage Bv′  is forced to follow its 
command AB vv ′=*  closely using the developed simple 
robust control approach. 
(c) Design of controller parameters 
The parameters of the proposed inverter DM and CM 
control schemes shown in Fig. 34(b) are determined in 
similar fashion, only the design of master DM control 
scheme is described below: 
y Removing )(swvd  in Fig. 34(b) and letting only the 
PI feedback controller )(sGcv  be added, the 
developed micro-grid system is normally operated at 
( Ω= 400ABR ; Ω= 100AR ; Ω= 100BR , V48=dV ,
V400=dcV ). The parameters of )(sGcv are determined 
experimentally as follows: (i) The proportional gain is 
first set to reduce the tracking error vdε  as far as 
possible without causing abnormal operation due to the 
contaminated feedback noises; Then (ii) the integral 
term is added and determined to further reduce the 
steady-state error. Obviously, the zero steady-state 
error of sine voltage waveform cannot be achieved by 
applying PI feedback control only.

steady-state performances at various load power levels are 
satisfactory.

2.11 Redesign of the SRG-Based Common DC     
Micro-grid  
The schematics and control schemes of the redesigned 
SRG-based micro-grid system is shown in Fig. 42. 
Compared with the system established previously, the 
modifications of this system are summarized as: (i) The 
DSP TMS32028335 is employed to replace the DSP 
ADMC 401. Owing to the more powerful execution 
capability, the hysteresis current control schemes are 
realized digitally in the DSP; (ii) The control scheme of 
the CFPP converter is realized using the DSP 
TMS320F2812. The modified control schemes possess 
more flexible control capability and performances. 
Let ( V48=∗dv , V400=∗dcv , Ω= 536dcR ) and the prime 
mover driven speed be rpm600050006000 →→=rω , Fig.
