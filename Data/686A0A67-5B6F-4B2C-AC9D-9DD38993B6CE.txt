摘要 
 由於內螺紋(Internal Thread)特殊的結構與空間位置的限制，目前尚未發現以機器視覺為
基礎的內螺紋檢測機台。本研究發展一套光學螺紋塞規(Optical Thread Plug Gauge，OTPG)，
可對內螺紋工件進行非接觸式的自動化檢測。OTPG 乃以硬式工業內視鏡(Rigid Industrial 
Endoscope)及電荷耦合元件(Charge Coupled Device，CCD)組成取像光學模組，並透過觸發器
(Trigger)與兩組馬達控制單元(Motion Control Unit)搭配，逐步拼貼連續拍攝到的部分螺紋影
像，以重建出 360 度內螺紋壁的二維全周影像圖(Unwrapped Image)，接著，運用影像處理技
術、快速傅立葉轉換法(Fast Fourier Transform，FFT)將影像還原，並配合統計管制圖之二值
化法來突顯依附在內螺紋上的瑕疵。OTPG可偵測出螺紋坡(Flank)上击起狀的刮痕(Scratch)，
以及螺峰(Crest)或螺谷(Root)上凹陷狀的崩塌(Collapse)或裂痕(Flaw)。

Abstract 
 This project is to design and develop a novel optical thread plug gauge (OTPG) for internal 
thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG is composed of a rigid industrial endoscope, a 
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A 
sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 
two-dimensional unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure 
is used to normalize, segment, and determine the quality of the internal thread. The proposed 
OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, 
collapses, and flaws in an internal thread.

Especially, the most common defects in internal thread are collapse on the crest, scratch on 
the flank and flaw on the root as shown in Figure 3. Among these defects, the scratch usually 
appears as a bulge that will cause an internal thread to seize with an external one; while the 
collapse or flaw appears as a cave that will decrease the fitting-in ability of a thread. In this year, 
we focus on developing an auto-inspection system to detect those defects that embedded on the 
homogeneous thread patterns. An implicit qualitative inspection algorithm [Newman and Jain 
(1995)] is adopted to reveal the embedded defects. The software algorithm of OTPG will include 
four major operators: unwrapped image normalization, normalized image segmentation, thread 
patterns blurring and defect extraction. These are discussed in section 2.

2.  Literature reviews 
2.1 Non-contact internal thread inspection systems 
 Some promising new techniques for non-contact internal thread inspection have been 
developed in recent two decades. Four types of test are briefly described below. 
(1) Reflected light test {Hassel [1, 2], Gore [3], Tu et al. [4], Zhao et al. [5], Zhao and Liao [6, 7]}: 
As show in Figure 4, the mechanism is equipped with a transmitter/receiver probe arranged 
perpendicular to the thread surface. The transmitter sends a light beam towards the thread, and 
the reflection goes back to the receiver. The reflectivity is used as a quantifiable feature for 
defect determination. Field [8] summarized two drawbacks of the reflected light test. First, 
when thread has been polluted by fluid or oil, varying levels of reflectivity can degrade the 
detection capability. Second, this technique senses only a small portion of the threaded hole 
due to the low scanning speed. 
 
Figure 4: Reflected light test system [7] 
(2) Magnetic flux leakage test {Wang et al. [9], He et al. [10]}: As shown in Figure 5, a magnetizer 
magnetizes a part of the internal thread to generate a magnetic leakage field. A detector detects 
the magnetic leakage field and transforms it into defect signals that can be used to identify 
defects in threads and mark their positions and ranges. The magnetic flux leakage test, however, 
can only be used on metal parts. 
8 
 
(4) Industrial computed tomography test {Liu et al. [12]}: As shown in Figure 7, the tomography 
of a part is retrieved from multiple directions and the system uses image processing to detect 
inner faults and measure their geometrical size. As with the reflected light test, this system only 
scans a small portion of the thread. Moreover, the computed tomography equipment is very 
expensive. 
 
Figure 7: Industrial computed tomography test system (depicted through the descriptions of [12]) 
 
2.2 Applications of rigid industrial endoscope 
    It is impossible for an ordinary detector to look inside small-diameter holes to evaluate 
internal conditions. George Sumner Crampton developed the first rigid endoscope in 1921 to check 
for possible flaws inside the rotor of a steam turbine {Lang [13]}. The distinct characteristics of 
the endoscope are that it can extend the range of vision and change the angle of view to see what 
could not otherwise be seen. Modern endoscopes are complex, vital non-contact inspection 
instruments that include an optical-mechatronic sensor and an auto-control scheme. In the past two 
decades, endoscopes have been used in a wide range of industrial applications. Parenti et al. [14] 
used them to analyze the combustion in a burner. Tsushima et al. [15] employed them to inspect 
the inner walls of steel tubes for corrosion. Boudjahi et al. [16] developed an integrated system for 
detecting micorcacks in pipes. Gu [17] used a video-endoscope in civil aviation maintenance.

pixel-by-pixel or sub-pixel-by-sub-pixel basis so that the maximum matching score can be found 
and the corresponding alignment coordinate can be determined {Perng et al. [22, 23, 27]}. 
Although the registration image of the former method may be rougher than the latter one, it is 
highly computationally efficient and so was used in this dissertation. 
 
2.4 Surface inspection for directional textures 
    Directional textures arise mainly in machined surfaces and textile fabrics. These consist of 
repetitive and periodic line primitives on the texture surface. Detecting local anomalies embedded 
in a directional texture surface is one of the important research problems in machine vision and can 
be broadly applied to surface quality control. Numerous approaches to the problem have been 
proposed: statistical, structural, spatial domain filtering, spectral domain filtering, and model-based 
approaches [30, 31]. Among the spectral approaches, the Fourier transform [32, 33], the wavelet 
transform [34–36], and the Gabor filter [37, 38] have been widely used in texture defect detection. 
An image processing method based on Fourier-based restoration was used in this project.

be the initial root. 
Figure 9 shows an initial reconstructed unwrapped image of an internal thread. We first apply 
the grayscale closing operator with k1 × k1 mask size (k1 is larger than one and is an odd integer) 
to fix the interspaces and fill up the holes; the result is shown in Figure 9(a). We then convert the 
grayscale image of Figure 9(a) to a binary image using a threshold value calculated with Equation 
(1) to separate the crests and roots from the flanks, 
  k2max  valuethreshold  G                     (1) 
where G is the universal set of gray values of Figure 9(a) and k2∈[1, max(G) – 1] is an offset 
constant. This produces the binary image of Figure 9(b). In Figure 9(b), we regard each 
eight-connected foreground element as a blob and apply a row-by-row labeling algorithm from left 
to right and top to bottom. The row-by-row labeling algorithm is guaranteed to find the initial root 
of an internal thread because it is the first one to be produced in the tapping process. The blob of 
the initial root is labeled as the index one and its corresponding right-bottom coordinate (x*, y*), 
the start point of the tapping process, is recorded. Then we map (x*, y*) onto the unwrapped image 
of Figure 9 and divide this image into left and right sub-images, as shown in Figure 9(c), based on 
the x* coordinate. The unwrapped image can be rounded arbitrarily due to the intrinsic cylindrical 
structure of the internal thread. We can obtain a normalized image by rounding the coordinate of 
the start point to the right-hand side, as shown in Figure 9(d). Note that this normalization 
operation can assure the repeatability of the unwrapped image; this will be discussed further in the 
following year. 
14

where the blob with index one is regarded as the initial root of the thread and its corresponding 
right-bottom coordinate (x*, y*) is the start point of the tapping process, (c) division of the 
unwrapped image into left and right sub-images based on the (x*, y*) coordinate, and (d) 
normalized image generated from rounding the coordinate of the start point in Figure 9(c) to the 
right-hand side 
3.2 Normalized image segmentation 
Note that the first two and the last thread patterns of an internal thread can be ignored because 
the beginning and ending stages of the tapping process form relatively unstable and abnormal 
patterns. Moreover, these thread patterns are not important in the interaction with an external 
thread for creating a firm fastening. We focus only on the remaining thread patterns, named the 
inspected image, in the normalized image and so develop an automatic segmentation process. The 
normalized image segmentation procedure is explained below and illustrated in Figure 10. 
The inner surface of an internal thread comprises repetitive and periodic thread patterns. A 
scan along the line that extends from the top to the bottom in the vertical direction of (x*, y*) in 
Figure 9(b) will touch on the initial root first, followed by the initial crest, followed by the second 
root and then the second crest, etc. This is the ideal case, however, because some noise blobs may 
interrupt the regularity. Thus an efficient sub-operation for eliminating the noise blobs is necessary. 
Based on the results of Figure 9(b), we obtain a binary image where each blob has a unique 
labeling index. However, there are still some noise blobs in Figure 9(b) especially distributed at the 
start and end of the crest. To eliminate them, we examine two properties of each blob: the area and 
the angle. The noise blobs with a small area or irregular angle relative to the angle of the crests and 
roots are eliminated. After applying this blob elimination sub-operation on Figure 9(b), we obtain 
the clear labeled image shown in Figure 10(a). Then by scanning along a line that stretches from 
the top to bottom of the image in the vertical direction of (x*, y*), we can record the top 
coordinates of the third- and second-last roots. Based on the coordinates of the third- and 
second-last roots, we can determine upper and lower segmented bounds along the horizontal

for frequency variables u = 0, 1, 2, ..., m - 1 and v = 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1. Notice that we have 
multiplied f(x, y) by (-1)
x+y
 and shifted the origin of F(u, v) to the frequency coordinates (m / 2, n / 
2). As shown in Figure 11(a), the global thread patterns are easily distinguishable as a 
concentration of high-energy lines in the spectrum that are orthogonal to the direction of thread 
pattern in Figure 10(c). 
3.3.2 Eliminating high-energy frequency components elimination by notch-rejected filters 
Since thread patterns and scratch defects are oriented in the same direction in the inspected 
image, the thread patterns are mixed together with the orthogonal lines in the spectrum. Since 
orthogonal lines may be due to both thread patterns and scratches, using a band-rejected filter to 
eliminate the orthogonal, as reported by Tsai and Hsieh [32], is not an appropriate approach. In this 
project, we map the wide dynamic range of F(u, v) in Figure 11(a) into a narrow range of P(u, v) 
by a logarithm transformation and scale its intensity into an eight-bit gray level using, 
     vu,F1logSvu,P                         (3) 
where S(․) is a scaling sub-operation. Some high-energy frequency components in the spectrum 
image can then be determined in terms of a high-energy threshold, and are set to zero by the 
notch-rejected filters described in,

3.3.3 Image restoration using inverse Fourier transformation (IFT) 
After eliminating the specific high-energy frequency components with notch-rejected filters, 
we back transform the spectrum image into the spatial domain using the IFT,

lower limits, it is shown as white and is considered to be a thread element that should be removed. 
Otherwise, it is shown as black and is considered to be a defective element that should be 
preserved. The result of applying the SPC binarization method on Figure 11(c) is shown in Figure 
12 where the eight-connected component labeling procedure had applied to remove small-area 
noise blobs. The threshold for small-area noise blobs can be set in terms of the specification of 
requirement.

4.2 Sensitivity analysis of parameter settings  
As implemented, the OTPG algorithm described in Section 3.3 has four major parameters that 
influence the inspection outcome: the mask size of grayscale closing operator k1, the offset 
constant k2, the high-energy threshold k3, and the control constant k4. 
4.2.1 Effects of the mask size of grayscale closing operator k1 and the offset constant k2 
 The parameter k1 is the rectangular size of the mask of grayscale closing operator that can 
mend the interrupted crests or roots in the internal thread image. The parameter k2 is an offset 
constant that can adjust the binary threshold value in Eq. 1 to enable the user to reveal the pixels 
with gray levels between max(G)−k2 and max(G) in Figure 9a. The bright bands (crests or roots) 
and gray bands (flanks) in the morphological image of the internal thread can be well mended and 
totally separated if both k1 and k2 are selected properly. That permits the analysis of the 
normalization and segmentation procedures in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 to proceed successfully. In 
general, as the value of k1 or k2 increases, there are more and more crests and roots will join into 
the connected blobs. On the contrary, as the value of k1 or k2 decreases, neither the crest nor the 
root will be well shaped or well mended. Those blobs will appear as false crests or roots so that the 
22

4.2.2 Effect of the high-energy threshold k3 
The high-energy threshold of Eq. 4 assists in producing notch-rejected filters to eliminate the 
high-energy frequency components in the spectrum. In general, a large value of k3 was used so 
that only one notch-rejected filter was generated at the center of the spectrum. The overall 
structure was retained in the corresponding restored image. An appropriate value of k3 was used to 
remove the periodic directional texture of the thread pattern while preserving the defects. Note that 
the notch-rejected filters were allocated in a direction orthogonal to the thread pattern spread range 
near the center of the spectrum image only. A smaller value of k3 was selected to generate too 
many unnecessary notch rejected filters so that the global structure and defects were all removed, 
leaving nothing meaningful.  
Twenty-two samples were used to calculate the corresponding average angle of the notch 
filters in the Fourier domain. The included angles between the angle of thread pattern in the spatial 
domain and the angle of the notch filters in the Fourier domain are shown as functions of k3 in 
Figure 16. The average included angles increased gradually when k3 was in the range of 1–168. 
When k3 was in the range of 168–220, the average included angles were approximately orthogonal. 
When k3 was greater than 220, only one notch filter was produced in the Fourier domain so that 
the corresponding average included angle could not be computed. Experience from the training

4.3 Experimental results 
In this section, we present some experimental results of internal thread inspection to confirm 
the function of the proposed OTPG. Figure 18a1–a5 shows inspected images of good or defective 
internal threads. The parameters generated from 22 training samples were k1=9, k2=7, k3=194, 
and k4=5.8 (to take the middle values of these corresponding recommended intervals). Figure 
18b1–b5 shows the corresponding inspection results. A non-defective internal thread image 
resulted in a clear response; otherwise, defects were clearly indicated in their actual locations. As 
previously mentioned, a scratch will cause an internal thread to bind with an external one, and a 
collapse or flaw will decrease the tight fit. The pixels of a scratch were relatively bright and the 
pixels of a collapse or flaw were relatively dark compared to the blurred thread patterns in the 
restored image.  
Forty-four testing samples (23 non-defective and 21 defective) were tested for evaluating the 
inspection rate of proposed method. After applying the proposed OTPG algorithm, we had no any 
false alarm but only one miss detection; this meant that the inspection rate was up to 97.72%. The 
only miss-detection was due to the scratches on the flanks that were small and non continuous, so 
they were miss-regarded as small-area noise blobs to be miss-removed.  
For quality assurance purposes, we classified the internal threads into four categories. First,

Abstract—In this paper, we developed a robust machine vision system for backlit mouse defect inspection. The defects 
might include incorrect illuminating area, incorrect LED color saturation, fragment or crack lighting pattern on the backlit 
mouse. A set of machine vision algorithms were designed to segment the inspection regions (IRs) and extract three features of 
the segmented IRs. These features were area of illuminating region, mean red value, and shape similarity. Two modes based 
machine vision system, engineer mode for testing-phase and operator mode for inspection-phase were used to inspect the 
mentioned defect. Some experiments were given to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed backlit mouse defect 
vision inspection system.
