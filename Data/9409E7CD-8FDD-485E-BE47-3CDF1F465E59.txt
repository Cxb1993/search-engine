The spherical mechanism is a particular type of spatial mechanism.  Due to the orientation of its 
joint axes and the curvature of its links, the workspaces of spherical mechanisms (whether line 
segments, closed loops or area regions) are spherical in curvature.   This characteristic of spherical 
mechanisms makes them quite effective and practical in motion path and function generation 
applications requiring spherical rigid body kinematics. 
Although there are design methods available for spherical mechanisms, most of these methods 
do not consider the design of a single adjustable spherical mechanism.  With an adjustable spherical 
mechanism, the user could for example, relocate the fixed or moving pivots of the spherical 
mechanism to achieve a greater range of rigid body locations and orientations.    Having 
adjustability would make a single mechanism effective for multiple design applications. 
Numerous methods have been published for the design of adjustable planar mechanisms.   
Unfortunately, the number of design methods for adjustable spherical mechanisms, in comparison, is 
extremely modest.  This research bridges the gap between the need for adjustable spherical 
mechanism design methods and the design methods available for adjustable planar mechanisms. 
This research look for a new method for synthesizing adjustable spherical four and five-bar path 
generators using planar path generation methods.  The benefits of the method are twofold.   One 
benefit is that the user can design spherical mechanisms to approximate multiple phases of prescribed 
rigid-body path points.  Another benefit is that the user can design spherical path generators using 
synthesis methods for planar path generators.  By projecting the coordinates of a given spherical 
mechanism on a plane or the coordinates of a given planar mechanism on a sphere, the user may 
design both planar and spherical mechanisms respectively. The research will look for sphere-to-plane 
and plane-to-sphere projection methods with optimization methods to minimize the structural error 
between the prescribed performance of the adjustable spherical mechanism and the performance 
achieved by the synthesized adjustable spherical mechanism.

Multi-phase Planar mechanism 
The objective in path generation is to synthesize a mechanism to achieve a series of prescribed 
rigid-body points.  For the five-bar mechanism illustrated in, Figure 1, the rigid body is a machining 
tool and the rigid body points are various locations of the tool tip.  The objective in multi-phase path 
generation is to design an adjustable mechanism to achieve multiple series of prescribed rigid-body 
points.  The advantage of multi-phase path generation is that the user can design a path generator to 
achieve multiple series (or phases) of prescribed rigid-body points using essentially the same hardware.  
Rigid body points p1, p2, and p3 are achieved when the five-bar mechanism illustrated in Figure 2(b) 
incorporates the moving pivots a1 and c1, and rigid body points p1, p4, and p5 are achieved when 
mechanism incorporates moving pivots a1n and c1n.

Spherical Mechanism and its Applications 
Due to the link geometry and joint orientation of the four revolute spherical mechanisms (Figure 
3), its workspace would exist on a sphere as opposed to the planar workspaces produced by planar 
mechanisms.  The capacity for spherical manipulation of rigid bodies in a mechanism has been 
proven to be quite advantageous when the rigid body is a camera (Figure 4) or a fan (Figure 5).  In 
Figure 4, a camera is mounted on a 3-DOF spherical mechanism.  This mechanism is called the 
“Agile Eye” and its responsiveness is comparable to that of the human eye.  In Figure 5, a fan is 
mounted to a four revolute spherical mechanism.  This mechanism is called “The Infinity Fan” and is 
capable of thoroughly circulating air in a room even when facing a corner.  If one can design such

The function for the plane is given in equation 1.  The projection length “d” is the distance 
between the center of the sphere and the plane.  The center of the sphere is coincident with global 
origin and the surface of the sphere is represented by the equation 2 where variable “r” is the radius of 
the sphere.  The projection line from the point on the plane (xp,yp,zp) to center of the sphere is 
represented by equation 3.  The point of intersection between the projection line and the surface of 
the sphere (xs,ys,zs) is expressed in equation 4.

Figure 9. Planar five-bar path generator with driving link angles θ and φ 
In Figure 9, there are five of the six unknowns in a0, a1 and a1n.  The variable a0x and the link length 
R1 were specified (a0x = 0 and R1 = 1).  Using the following initial guesses: 
 a0y = 0.01,  a1=(0.1, 0.9),  a1n=(-0.1,0.9), 
the planar five-bar mechanism solutions converged to 
 a0y = 0.0004,  a1=(0.1219, 0.9930), and a1n=(-0.1344, 0.9913). 
     Using displacement analysis, these displacement angles (δθ) are -10°, -20°, and -30° for phase 1 
and -10° and -20° for phase 2.  The displacements for angle φ were calculated using the relationship 
of δφ = f (δθ) = 0.5*δθ.  This relationship produced the displacement δφ angles of -5°, -10° and -15° 
for phase 1 and -5° and -10° for phase 2. 
     In Figure 9, there are five of the five unknowns in b1, c1 and c1n.  The variable b0 and the link 
R4 were specified (b0 = (1.25, 0), R4 = 1, φ1 = 45°).  Using the following initial guesses:  
 c1=( 0.9, 1.5), c1n=(1.2, 1.8), R3=1.3, 
the planar five-bar mechanism solutions converged to 
 c1=( 0.8913, 1.4542), c1n=( 1.2167, 1.7775), and R3=1.3016. 
     The rigid body points generated by the synthesized planar five-bar mechanism (see Figure 10) 
are given in Table 2.  A gear train was incorporated in the synthesized five-bar mechanism.  Since 
the prescribed relationship between the driving link displacement angles was δφ = f(δθ) = 0.5*δθ, a 
2:1 gear ratio between both driving links is required.

計畫成果自評 
The research developed the new technique for synthesizing multi-phase four-bar and five-bar spherical 
path generator according to the research plan.  The result of the research completely satisfies the 
original research plan and schedule.  In the future, the research could be written as journal paper or 
conference paper for publication and the new technique could be applied to the design of multi-phase 
spherical path generators in industry.  The benefits of the new technique are twofold; it’s a simple 
way to deign the spherical mechanisms, and the spherical mechanisms could have more work space 
and adjustable functions.  Moreover, the new technique could be applied to the spherical motion 
generators and the research can be used as the base of the synthesis for multi-phase spherical 
mechanisms with tolerance.  In the future, the two topics would be the important issues for the 
research of the authors.
