how pilot whales follow ISWs in the SCS [27]. The mixing and dissipation generated by
internal waves also have important effects on cross slope exchange processes, enhancement
of bottom stress, and generation of nepheloid layers.
It has recently been proposed that internal waves may also make a significant contribution
to internal oceanic mixing and hence have an important influence on climate change. Given
the afore-mentioned reasons, it is clear why it is important to scrutinize the interaction of
nonlinear internal solitary waves (ISWs) with the seabed topography [5–7,4,15,16,21,23,24,
26,33]. However, it should also be noted that since energy dissipation plays such an important
and varied role in the movement of water and sediment in coastal seas [3], we need to include
this when developing a better fitting and more appropriate model for predicting ISW prop-
agation and the breaking criterion. A statistics-based methodology based on internal wave
data is earnestly needed. Zheng et al. [34] utilized data collected from the years 1995 to 2001
for their pioneering statistical analysis of IW occurrence. They made field measurements of
sea surface wind, sea state and vertical temperature profiles which were used for analyzing
IW generation and for generating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging conditions.
Soon after this, the effects of weighted parameters on the amplitude and reflection of
energy-based ISWs from uniform slopes in a two layered fluid system were investigated
[8]. The results of that study were quite consistent with other experimental results, and are
applicable to the naturally occurring reflection of ISWs from sloping bottoms. More recently,
Chen et al. [12] concluded that the goodness-of-fit and predictive ability of the cumulative
logistic regression models make them better than binary logistic regression models for the
modeling of the ISW-ridge interaction. After removing outliers and influential observations
from the data, the remaining observations are refitted to find the goodness-of-fit of the revised
model [13]. However, the data in these cases are so small that some observations have pro-
portions close to zero or one; furthermore, inferences based on the asymptotic distribution
of the change in deviance must also be taken into account [14].
Researchers have classified the level of wave-ridge interaction by means of visual descrip-
tion based on previous experience [9]. The traditional method calls for further improvement
by statistical manipulation. This study is primarily aimed at making improvements using
data collected from the Ref. [9]. The existing strategy for classification of wave-ridge inter-
actions into three degrees of magnitude is reviewed and a statistical classification scheme
is outlined which might provide a frame-of-reference for future endeavors. The rest of this
paper is organized the paper as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the experimental set-up and
theoretical background needed to understand the hydrodynamic interaction. We also dis-
cuss the physical parameters utilized in the study. Section 3 is devoted to the derivation of
a mathematical model and the attempt to adapt a system model for data analysis using this
statistical method. In Sect. 4, some results are stated and illustrated. The methodology is
obviously efficient and significant. Finally, some conclusions are offered and extensions for
future research highlighted.
2 Experiments and physical system
The data are obtained from experimental measurement. Some physical parameters are
acquired via sequential analyses of digital signal processing and mathematical manipulation.
2.1 Setup
The experiments were conducted in a 12 m (l) × 0.5 m (w) × 0.7 m (h) wave flume with a
vertically removable sluice gate mounted on the right hand side. This gate could be opened

B > 1, the tip reaches into the interface. It was found that for very high blocking, say B ≥ 1.2,
virtually no signal was transmitted and the entire wave train was reflected [33]. On the other
hand, for small B, the entire wave was transmitted and there was virtually no reflection.
3 Discriminant analysis
Discriminant analysis (DA) is suitable for the classification and grouping of large data sets
for various experiments. Prior studies indicate that DA is suitable when a high classification
rate is needed; see references [19,18,20]. DA is a multivariate statistical method and group-
ing technique used to find the linear combination of ratios which best discriminate between
the groups which are being classified. The difference between two or more groups is the
discriminant function; only one discriminant function is required for two groups. When there
are more than two groups, one uses the minimum number of discriminant function(s) needed
to best represent the difference between them [29]. DA is the appropriate statistical technique
for estimating both categorical and metric variables attributed to dependent and independent
variables. The DA function can be written as [22]
Z jk = b + ai Xik, (4)
where ∀Z jk is the Z score of discriminant function j for object k; b is the intercept; ai is
the weight of independent variable I; Xik is the independent variable i for object k. Like in a
regression model, ai is the discriminant coefficient for maximizing the discriminant criterion
λ, in which λ = a′ Aa
a′W a ; ∀A is among the group consisting of the sums of the square and
cross products matrix (SSCP); W is pooled within the group SSCP matrix. To establish the
DA function one also has to focus on the max λ (see Appendix I).
The discriminant rule is also used to predict the classification of the variables as in the
following function (for a two group example):
c = N2 Z1 + N1 Z2
N1 + N2 , (5)
where N is the variable amount; Zi is the average value of the DA score.
If Zi < c, then it is classified as part of Group 1.
Zi > c, it can be classified as part of Group 2.

4.2 Three classifications of the degree of blocking
We next investigate the degree of blocking versus dimensionless wave amplitude. There are
three obvious group centers located at 0.1205, 0.1238 and 0.1470, as shown in Table 3. An
F-value of 5.791 is significant (p < .0000), indicating that equality of groups means statis-
tical significance. The canonical discriminant function is Z = 0.756 B + 0.102ai/H2 and its
eigenvalue is 3.924. Table 4 presents a summary of the classification results giving an overall
classification rate of 98.7%.
Figure 4 shows a plot of the scattering of the degree of blocking versus dimensionless wave
amplitude. There are three obvious categories divided by the two linear functions. From the
clustering of the DA, we find that the previous data points a and b (see the figure) should
be categorized in opposite zones. The two parallel lines (with linearity) indicate the zone of
moderate interaction. When the ridge is short, e.g., B < 0.4, or when the wave is small in
123
584 Environ Fluid Mech (2010) 10:577–586
amplitude, there is no effect on the internal solitary wave. The encounter between wave and
ridge can be regarded as a weak interaction. On the other hand, for a large blockage, e.g.,
B > 0.6, the ridge can block the propagation of the incident wave to cause vortex induced
wave breaking. The experimental results show that although the amplitude of the ISW in the
wave tank is small (e.g., ai/H2 of about 0.06), the waveform is still affected by the topography
of the seabed and results in breaking.
5 Conclusions
We demonstrate the successful application of a multivariate statistical method for classify-
ing the evolution of an ISW over a submarine ridge in a stratified two-layer fluid system.
Although classification by visual examination may be more convenient, this method lacks
a mathematical basis and scientific reproducibility. Statistical data analysis techniques can
improve method validation and ease of interpretation. Multivariate functions are more suit-
able for discriminating among groups in large sample sets than is visual assessment. The
results of this study are a reminder to researchers that DA is a better choice to check or
classify exact experimental data experimental.
The ideal rate for classifying the relationship between a dimensionless wave speed and the
blockage parameter is 100%; the rate is 98.7% (one exception) for the relationship between
the degree of blocking versus dimensionless wave amplitude. Accuracy of classification is
rather high for ISW evolution over a submarine ridge in a stratified two-layer fluid system. The
recommended cut-off points for the classification criterion for discriminating between “weak
interaction”, “moderate interaction” and “wave breaking” are 0.5 and 0.78 and are obtained
using a single experimental measurement of the blockage parameter. Another method for
stationary estimation is to look at the relationship between the degree of blocking and dimen-
sionless wave amplitude. We utilize two empirical functions to classify data into three groups.
The functions are self-parallel and linear. The results of the study should also be of benefit in
the fields of ocean engineering and oceanography for the examination of a stratified two-layer
fluid system.
The main objective of the present study is to classify the flow regimes associated with
the submarine ridge encounter. Statistical methods are used to investigate and classify the
degree of ISW-ridge interaction. The results clearly indicate that DA plays a role in estimating
degrees of ISW-ridge interaction events. Because of the complex nature of the physical obser-
vation process, neither numerical analyses nor laboratory experiments in nature seem enough
clearly describe the wave features. Rather than assuming classification efficiency based on the
visible mechanism, specific effort is needed to directly estimate the classification efficiency
of such ISW-ridge interaction events.
Further challenges suggested by this current work include extending the data obtained in
the field to cover the full range of natural phenomenon. Also, the effects of breaking ISWs
on the energy spectrum need to be addressed; this could potentially help clarify and identify
which slope areas are likely to yield significant mixing due to breaking waves.
