values. The oscillation amplitudes (OAs) and
the cuff pressure are then used to determine the
mean arterial, systolic and diastolic pressures.
Many researchers used the mathematical model
of oscillometry, which contained arterial model,
tissue characteristic and cuff mechanism, to
study the inaccuracy of oscillometry. They
found that the vascular hydrodynamic
parameters including blood pressure, heart rate,
arterial compliance, vascular resistance, etc.,
would affect the accuracy of the measured
blood pressure [3]. But, in our studies, the
oscillometric model was used to reconstruct the
arterial model that is the dynamic compliance
with the system identify theorem. In the
arterial model, the arterial volume change is
response to the transmural pressure. Thus, the
oscillation patterns will imply the arterial
Pressure-Volume (P-V) relationship.
Therefore, we designed a new device based on
the microcontroller that could simultaneously
detect the oscillations of the cuff pressure and
the cuff volume during the cuff deflation
duration. According the oscillometric model,
the brachial arterial model was constructed.
2. Measuring the Dynamic Compliance
Because the cuff outside tightly closes the
tissue during the cuff deflation duration, the
tissue characteristic and the cuff mechanism
can be considered the cuff model. Therefore,
if we can identify the cuff model, the arterial
model will be reconstructed.
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the
proposed measurement system. We used the
cuff volume and cuff pressure to make the cuff
model, and OAs and cuff pressure to make the
oscillometric model. Then, the brachial
arterial model was constructed with the cuff
model and oscillometric model. The
oscillometric mechanism contains a cuff,
pressure transducer, a mass-flow meter, a
pumping air motor, and a releaser valve to
detect the cuff pressure, volume and OAs in
each heart beat. The fuzzy logic
discrimination and recursive weighting
regression approach methods had been
described in the Lin et al. [4] were used to
extract the systolic and diastolic pressures and
the oscillometric model. The measured cuff
pressure and volume in each heart beat are also
used to construct the compliance of cuff with a
recursive regression approach. Thus, the
dynamic vessel arterial P-C curve can be
identified with the cuff and oscillometric
models.
The occlusive cuff affords the opportunity
to vary the arterial transmural pressure while
recording the segmental vessel volume. The
transmural pressure, Pt, is the difference
between the arterial pressure, Pa, and cuff
pressure, CP. Since the cuff is elastic and
contains compressed air, it is possessed of
compliance. If the cuff compliance is known,
it can be used to find the arterial volume pulse
( arterypulseV _ ) from
oscpulsecuffarterypulse PCPCCPV __ )()(  , (1)
where Ccuff is cuff compliance; Ppulse_osc is cuff
pressure pulse. The volume pulse is defined
here as the instantaneous vascular area changes
in the arterial volume segment under the cuff.
In order to find the arterial vessel compliance,
the volume pulse is divided by the pulse
pressure, pulseP , (the difference between the
systolic and diastolic pressures),

statement, a mass-flow meter is connected to a
releasing air valve. It can continuously record
the change flow rate of cuff, when the cuff is in
a deflating process. Because the flow meter
catches the cuff pumping flow rate (CF), the
cuff volume (CV) is evaluated by integrating
the cuff pumping flow rate. From the
previous investigation, we could find that the
normal cuff model was close to an exponential
shape, so the recursive regression approach was
used to fit the model.
