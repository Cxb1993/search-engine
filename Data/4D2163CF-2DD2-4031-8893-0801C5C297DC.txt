limit their applicability and especially increase the 
higher cost of feedstock recycling for waste plastic 
treatment. Therefore, catalytic degradation 
provides a means to address these problems [5]. 
The addition of catalyst is expected to reduce 
decomposition temperature, to promote 
decomposition speed, and to modify the products. 
The catalytic degradation of polymeric materials 
has been reported for a range of model catalysts 
centred around the active components in a range 
of different model catalysts, including amorphous 
silica-aluminas, zeolites Y, mordinite and ZSM-5  
and the family of mesoporous MCM-41 materials. 
However, these catalysts have been used that 
even if performing well, they can be unfeasible 
from the point of view of practical use due to the 
cost of manufacturing and the high sensitivity of 
the process to the cost of the catalyst. Another 
option for the chemical recycling of polymer 
wastes by using fluidized catalytic cracking 
catalysts is attractive. Therefore, an alternative 
improvement of processing the recycling via 
catalytic cracking would operate in mixing the 
polymer waste with fluid catalytic cracking 
commercial catalysts.  
Moreover, there are problems with the use of 
this kind of cracking catalysts; in particular, coke 
formation occurs during the reaction and the 
catalysts gradually deactivate. Considering that 
the FCC process follows an operation based on 
the equilibrium between the coke combustion and 
its consumption by cracking reactions, the yield of 
coke from the polymers deserves special 
consideration, since it is significant and could 
govern the implementation of this option. The 
objective of this work is to explore the capabilities 
of TGA system in the catalytic degradation of 
polypropylene for the development of several 
concepts intended to investigate the spent FCC 
catalyst for its activity, deactivation behaviour and 
regenerability, and specifically for the comparison 
of other commercial cracking catalysts involved to 
enhance the potential benefit of catalytic polymer 
recycling. In addition, a more interesting approach 
is that of adding polymer waste into the FCC 
process, under suitable process conditions with 
the use of zero value of spent FCC catalysts, a 
large number of waste plastics can be 
economically converted into valuable 
hydrocarbons. The objective of this work is to 
explore the capabilities of a catalytic fluidised bed 
reaction system using various cracking and FCC 
catalysts for the study of product distribution and 
selectivity on the catalytic degradation of a 
post-consumer polyolefin waste (polymer waste  
mixture), and specifically for identification of 
suitable reaction conditions for enhancing the 
potential benefits of catalytic polymer recycling.  
 
2.  Experimental 
Various waste  mixture were pyrolysed over 
various catalysts. High purity nitrogen was used 
as the fluidizing gas and the flow was controlled 
by a needle valve and preheated in the bottom 
section of the reactor tube. Flowmeters were used 
to measure the full range of gas velocities from the 
incipient to fast fluidization. Before catalytic 
pyrolysis experiments were started, several 
fluidization runs were performed at ambient 
temperature and pressure to select: (i) suitable 
particle sizes (both catalyst and polymer waste) 
and (ii) optimize the fluidizing gas flow rates to be 
used in the reaction. The particle size of both 
catalyst (75-180 µm) and polymer (75-250 µm) 
were chosen to be large enough to avoid 
entrainment but not too large as to be 
inadequately fluidized. An excessive flow rate 
could cause imperfect fluidization and entrainment 
of fines Gaseous products were analysed using a 
gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal 
conductivity detector and a flame ionization 
detector (FID). The products are divided into 4 
polymer was completely decomposed. In Fig. 2, 
the differences in deviation from TG curves for the 
degradation of waste mixture is associated with 
both the nature of reaction mechanism and the 
use of different heating rates used in this study. 
The latter is a general characteristic of dynamic 
reaction. The former leads to production of a 
variety of volatile products. It is seem that the 
activation energy increases with the degree of 
conversion within the range of 10% to 90% weight 
loss curves calculated by the iso-conversion plot 
and the values as presented in Table 2.

Fig. 2. Weight loss curves for waste mixture 
degradation in the present of spent equilibrium 
fluidized catalytic cracking commercial catalyst.  
 
This effect could be ascribed to the nature of 
scission degradation in the presence of various 
cracking catalysts and the differences in 
deviations from the effect of volatile fragment 
diffusion at different level of coke content, as well 
as the relation of transient change in catalytic 
activity to catalyst deactivation. Although the 
process of catalytic degradation of waste mixture 
is far from an elementary reaction, kinetic 
information derived from thermogravimetric 
analysis, such as apparent activation energies, 
can be used for internal comparisons of catalysts. 
As can be seen in Table 1, the average activation 
energy for the thermal degradation of waste 
mixture was in agreement with previous literature 
values, while silicalite catalysts gave only a slight 
reduction in the activation energy (143.4 kJ mol-1) 
compared with thermal experiments (147.5 kJ 
mol-1). The value of activation energy for waste 
mixture decomposition at different fraction residual 
weights showed relatively comparable deviation 
among each other may be associated with the 
reaction mechanism occurring at a temperature 
with each degree of thermal conversion.

thermal and catalytic degradation of waste mixture

The activation energies determined by 
Ozawa’s method at different levels of conversion 
from 10-90% were in the 80.7 ~ 91.5 kJ mol-1 
range, with a mean value of 87.1 kJ mol-1. The 
apparent reaction order was 2. In this study, much 
lower apparent activation energy values were 
observed for FCC-s1 catalysts compared to 
silicalite catalysts. This indicates that the presence 
of spent FCC catalyst may allow the primary 
converted polymer to diffuse to the majority of the 
active sites, and consequently lead to the 
relatively low apparent activation energy. A fuller 
paper is being developed from the mass and heat 
transfer effects on different reaction conditions 
and the behaviors of catalyst deactivation as 
related to the structure of catalysts and their acid 
sites. Coked catalyst was regenerated and cooled, 
Although a slight difference was observed in 
the activation energy for the zeolite catalysts 
(ZSM-5 and HUSY), the much higher coke level 
for HUSY catalyst (Table 4) reflects the larger pore 
opening of zeolite Y (0.74 nm) and the presence of 
supercages within the structure of 1.3 nm 
diameter. The relatively low coke content in 
FCC-s1 (5.6-5.7 % w/w) than with HUSY catalysts 
(7.7-8.2 % w/w) may indicate possible constraints 
on the diffusion of liquid polymer into the pores, 
although the differences in the nature of the sites 
may also be relevant. However, ZSM-5 with 
narrower pore openings (0.55 x 0.51 nm) and no 
supercages, the bulky feed molecules have 
restricted access to the internal active catalytic 
sites and special restrictions within the pore 
system tend to inhibit the bimolecular processes 
leading to coke production (= 0.1 % w/w). The 
amount of coke obtained from TG reactions for 
waste mixture degradation over various cracking 
catalysts was typically HUSY ＞  FCC-s1 ＞ 
SAHA ＞ ZSM-5 ≈ Silicalite (Table 4).

coke content determined from TG weight curves.

HAHA 91.7 0.6 
Silicalite 143.4 0.2 
 
Although the comparison is not 
straightforward as reaction conditions are not 
matched, the results obtained in TGA runs can be 
compared with the amount of coke given in Table 
5, where it can be seen that the yield of coke 
content is observed with a similar trend to with the 
coke selectivity for the fluidise-bed reactions. The 
bulk of the products observed with these acidic 
cracking catalysts (FCC-s1, ZSM-5, HUSY and 
SAHA) were in the gas phase with less than 5 wt% 
liquid collected (Table 5). Also, the differences in 
the product distributions between those catalysts 
can be seen with ZSM-5 producing a much more 
C1-C4 hydrocarbon gases (56 wt%) than FCC-s1, 
HUSY and SAHA catalysts. Some similarities were 
observed between FCC-s1 and SAHA with C1-C4 
and C5-C9 yields, which were approximately 27-30 
wt% and 53-54 wt%, respectively. Due to the long 
chain dimensions of the polymer and its high 
viscosity, it seems logical to assume that the 
polymer macromolecules break down first on the 
external catalytic surface and only small 
fragments can enter the catalyst pore structure to 
undergo further reactions. This is consistent with 
the selectivity results reported previously involving 
the catalytic conversion of post-consumer polymer 
waste into hydrocarbons over fluidised cracking 
catalysts in a fluidised-bed reactor.

As also can be seen in Table 5, the yield of 
volatile hydrocarbons and the selectivity to gases 
reaction rate with reaction time over the course of 
the reaction. Both acidity and diffusion constraints 
within individual surface areas of each catalyst 
may play significant roles in the apparent rate 
constant and product selectivity.

Moreover, the value of the k3/k0 (coke 
selectivity) in FCC-s1 (3.3 %) than with ASA 
catalyst (2.2 %) may indicate possible constraints 
on the diffusion of liquid polymer into the pores, 
although the differences in the nature of the sites 
may also be relevant. However, ZSM-5 with 
narrower pore openings (0.55 x 0.51 nm) and no 
supercages, the bulky feed molecules have 
restricted access to the internal active catalytic 
sites and special restrictions within the pore 
system tend to inhibit the bimolecular processes 
leading to coke production (0.6 %). The rate 
constants for the catalytic degradation of 
commingled polymer waste over FCC-s1 with 
particle sizes of 125-180 µm and 75-120 µm at 
five different temperatures (330-450°C) are listed 
in Table 7. It could be the case that selectivity 
products of light gases increased with increasing 
reaction temperature and gasoline decreased with 
an increase in temperature below 430°C [8]. But at 
higher temperature (450°C), the degradation of 
commingled polymer waste to volatile products 
may precede both by catalytic and thermal 
reactions leading to the variation of product 
distributions. In Table 7, selectivity products of 
light gases increased with increasing reaction 
temperature and gasoline decreased with an 
increase in temperature. This product deviation 
could be ascribed to the nature of scission 
degradation in the presence of each catalyst and 
the differences in product selectivity from transient 
change in volatile fragment diffusion to the effect 
of different level of reaction temperature. The 
external surface of the catalysts is an important 
factor controlling activity and selectivity. From 
values of k11/k0 and k3/k0, the smaller particle 
FCC-s1-S catalyst (75-120 µm) shows a higher 
selectivity for gasoline (56.5~66.2 % vs. 54.1~63.5 
%) and a lower selectivity for coke (2.3~3.0 % vs. 
2.7~3.4 %) than the larger particle FCC-s1-L 
catalyst (125-180 µm). The FCC-s1 catalyst 
containing cracking activity with bimodal pore 
structures, which is composed of both the 
micropore of zeolite and the mesopore of 
silica-alumina used in the FCC catalyst matrix, can 
provide the cracking ability when they are enough 
accessible to the reactant and may allow bulky 
reactions to occur, ultimately leading to the 
generation of hydrocarbon products with some 
coke content deposited on the catalyst. The result 
appears that the feed can be cracked at or close 
to the external surface of the catalysts and 
therefore, the controlling catalytic parameters will 
be not only the total number of acid sites but also 
the number of accessible ones related to the 
particle size selected.
