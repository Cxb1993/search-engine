2The very recently reported analytical synthesis method
(ASM) [5-10] has been illustrated to be very helpful to
simultaneously achieve the three important criteria [4]:
(i) all single-ended-input OTAs (overcoming the
feed-through effects), (ii) all grounded capacitors
(absorbing shunt parasitic capacitances), and (iii) the
minimum number of active and passive component
counts (reducing power consumption, chip area, and
noise), for reducing the parasitics of OTA-C filters.
The new ASM exhibits that the complicated nth-order
trans-impedance transfer function is manipulated and
decomposed by a succession of innovative algebra
operations until a set of simple equations are produced
which are then realized using n integrators and a
constraint circuitry. As the cases shown before [5-10],
the new versatile-mode nth-order OTA-C universal
filter structure, obtained from the fundamental trans-
impedance mode one, achieves the above three
important criteria simultaneously as well.
II. VERSATILE-MODE ASM
As we would like to construct a versatile mode
(including voltage, current, trans-admittance, and
trans-impedance modes) OTA-C filter structure with
the minimum number of active and passive
components, first, we need to notice that the output
(resp. input) signal of an OTA is a current (resp.
voltage) signal. Then, the minimum component
versatile mode OTA-C filter structure must utilize the
voltage input and the current output of the OTA at the
input (resp. output) port to act as the voltage input
(resp. output) and the current input (resp. output) of the
whole structure, respectively. In addition to these, the
trans-impedance mode (having Vout and Iin) OTA-C
filter structure, belonging to the centre part from the
output of the OTA at the input port to the input of the
OTA at the output port, need have the minimum
number of active and passive components, i.e., one
more OTA than the nth-order current-mode OTA-C
universal filter structure whose minimum number of
both single-ended-input OTAs and grounded
capacitors is n [5].
In this section, the author would like to present a new
analytical synthesis method (ASM) which can realize a
trans-impedance-mode high-order single-ended- input
OTA and equal-C universal (low-pass, band-pass,
high-pass, band-reject, and all-pass) filter structure
which has the minimum number of active and passive
components leading to the minimum parasitics and
then the most precise output response. Equal
capacitance type filter structure is used in the design
for avoiding from the difficulty to fabricate several
capacitors without fixed-ratio capacitances in an
integrated circuit. The given trans-impedance-mode
nth-order all-pass filter transfer function is shown as
below.

(6) can be equal to (7) shown as below.
4putting an additional OTA at the input port of the
current and trans-impedance-mode one to do the
voltage-to-current transformation and shown in Figs. 3
and 4. We have seen that there are n+1 switches, S0, S1,
S2,…, Sn, existed in Figs. 3 and 4, each switch controls
one special order signal. It means that the new
versatile-mode nth-order OTA-C universal filter
structure is digitally programmable like [8].
The filter structures shown in Figs. 3 and 4 can be a
voltage, current, trans-impedance, and trans-
admittance mode, namely, versatile-mode, one, in
which there are high input impedance for a voltage
input and high output impedance for a current output
cascadabilities. Moreover, the gains of the voltage,
trans-impedance, and trans-admittance modes except
the current-mode one are adjustable.

filter structure
III. HSPICE SIMULATIONS
To validate the theoretical predictions, H-spice
simulations with TSMC 0.18µm process are used. We
employ the CMOS implementation of a trans-
conductor reported in [11], with ±0.9 V supply
voltages and W/L=5µ/1µ and 10µ/1µ for NMOS and
PMOS transistors, respectively. The component values
for the sixth-order universal Butterworth filter
structure derived from Figs. 3 and 4 are given by
C1=C2=C3= C4=C5=C6=2pF, and ga1=32µS, ga2=66µS,
ga3=102.5µS, ga4=153µS, ga5=243µS, ga6=485µS, ga7=
485µS (for CM and TI modes) or 456µS (for VM and
TA modes), and ga7=456µS (for VM and TA modes
only) for the theoretical fo=10M Hz. The simulation
results for the current (all-pass phase- frequency
response shown in Fig. 5), trans-impedance, voltage
(all-pass phase-frequency response shown in Fig. 6),
and trans-admittance modes have the different errors,
shown in Table 1, compared to the theoretical fo=10M
Hz. As can be seen, the current-mode one has the most
precise response which is better than its voltage-mode
counterpart and other two modes, namely,
trans-impedance and trans-admittance modes. Note
that the operational frequency has been extended to
10M Hz from the previous 1M Hz and still has rather
good precision.

Moreover, the sensitivity simulations, shown in Fig. 7,
with tolerances of -10% for C1, -10% for C2, -10% for
g1, and -10% for g2, show that the simulated 3dB
frequencies and errors are (i) 10.46M Hz (5.30% error),
(ii) 9.92M Hz (0.126% error), (iii) 9.40M Hz (5.40%
error), and (iv) 9.925M Hz (0.07% error), respectively,
for the current-mode second-order OTA-C low-pass
filter with C1=C2=4pF, g1=177µS, and g2=355µS,
having the 3dB nominal frequency at 9.933M Hz. The
above sensitivity simulation results demonstrate low
sensitivity performance.
IV CONCLUSIONS
None of the previous papers have reported such a
versatile-mode (including voltage, current, trans-
impedance, and trans-admittance modes) high-order
OTA-C universal filter structure using the recently
reported analytical synthesis method (ASM). The new
filter structure employs the minimum number of active
and passive components, i.e., n+2 single-ended- input
OTAs and n grounded capacitors which can
simultaneously realize versatile-mode nth-order
low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, notch, and all-pass
responses from the same configuration. The new filter
structure enjoys nearly all of the main advantages: (i)
utilizing the single-ended-input OTAs overcoming the
feed-through effects, (ii) employing grounded
capacitors attractive for integration and absorbing
shunt parasitic capacitance, (iii) using the minimum
number of active and passive components, (all of the
above three advantages lead to the minimum total
parasitics and have the most precise output responses),
(iv) digital programmability, (v) both high input
impedance of the voltage input and high output
impedance of the current output good for cascadability,
(vi) orthogonally controllable filtering parameters, (vii)
no need for changing the filter topology, (viii) no
component-value constraints, (ix) no need for inverting
amplifiers or double current input signals for special
input requirements, (x) a controllable gain except the
current-mode one, (xi) low sensitivity performance,
and (xii) precise operation at 10M Hz. H-Spice
simulations with TSMC018 process and ±0.9V supply
voltages are included and confirm the theoretical
predictions.

Abstract: - The realization of the second-order universal (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass) active current filter using a single second-generation current controlled conveyor (CCCII), two
grounded capacitors, and one resistor is proposed in this paper. Three input signals and the bias current of the
active element determine the filtering type of the output signals. H-Spice simulations with 0.35μm process are
used to validate the theoretical predictions of the filtering signal, very low sensitivities, and the correction for the

1 Introduction
In 1989, it was presented that circuits based on current
amplifiers operate at higher signal bandwidths, greater
linearity and larger dynamic range, than their
voltage-based circuit counter-parts [1]. Current-mode
circuits have emerged over the last two decades as an
important class of analogue circuits. A universal
(low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass) current-mode (current input and current
output) biquad which employs seven second-
generation current conveyors (CCIIs) in addition to
two grounded capacitors and three grounded resistors
was presented [2]. This biquad suffers from the
following two disadvantages: requirement of one
matching condition to realize an all-pass signal, and no
orthogonal control of 0  and Q. The improved
universal filter does not need any component matching
conditions and enjoys the orthogonal control of 0
and Q although with the same structure complexity [3].
The condensed universal filter employs only five CCIIs
in addition to two grounded capacitors and three
grounded resistors [4] was proposed which enjoys the
advantageous features: (i) no component matching, and
(ii) the independent control of 0  and Q. The active
component count of the universal filter was reduced to
four but with the addition of one more grounded
capacitor [5, 6], or using two floating capacitors and
two floating resistors [7], or employing two grounded
capacitors and two grounded resistors [8]. Then, a high
output impedance multifunction filter employing three
CCIIs, two grounded/floating capacitors and three
grounded/ floating resistors was presented [9] which
cannot enjoy low active sensitivities as high quality
factor is necessary. And then, a versatile
multi-input-multi-output universal biquad structure
was supplied using three current conveyors, two
grounded capacitors, and two grounded resistors,
which still has the two advantages: no orthogonal
control of 0  and Q and the limitation for high
frequency operation [10]. The last universal filter was
improved to be an insensitive one using three dual
output current conveyors, two grounded capacitors,
and three grounded resistors which, again, suffered
from the limitation for high frequency operation [11].
The current-mode universal biquad without any
matching conditions was condensed to the three-input
and three-output  structure with the minimum number
of components, two plus type CCIIs, two grounded
capacitors, and two grounded resistors [12]. The
single-current conveyor-based universal biquads with
low quality factor [13] or high quality factor [14] were
proposed using three capacitors and four/five resistors.
The five generic filter (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass,
band-reject, and all-pass) signals are obtained by
adjusting the values of one grounded capacitor and one
grounded resistor appropriately. In this paper, a new
current-mode universal biquad employing a single
second-generation current controlled conveyor (CCCII)
[15], whose internal resistance, denoted by Rx, at the
input terminal X can be varied by tuning its bias current,
two grounded capacitors, and one floating resistor is
presented whose structure is much simpler than the
previous two single-current conveyor-based universal
biquads [13, 14]. Three input signals and the variable
Rx determine the five different generic filtering signals
33 H-spice Simulations
The filtering performance of the new universal active
current filter shown in Fig. 1 is shown in Figs. 3 to 7
by the TSMC035 level-49 H-Spice simulation (using
the CMOS implementation of the CCCII [15], shown
in Fig. 2, with the supply voltages VBDD B=1.65V,
VBSSB=-1.65V, and W/L=5μ/1μ and 10μ/1μ for NMOS
and PMOS transistors, respectively), and with
element values RB1B11=9kΩ, GB2 B=222.14μS (for al-pass,
GB2=444.28μm), and CB1B=50 pF, CB2B= 50 pF for the
3dB frequency at 500kHz and CB1B=25 pF, CB2B=25 pF
for the 3dB frequency at 1MHz, respectively. The
simulation results of the 3dB frequency of the
low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass output signals are 544.6kHz (error 8.91%)
and 1.0924MHz (error 9.24%); 524.8kHz (error
4.96%) and 1.0471MHz (error 4.71%); 498.6kHz
(error -0.28%) and 0.9855MHz (error -1.45%);
524.8kHz (error 4.96%) and 1.0471MHz (error
4.71%); And 716.1kHz (error 43.23%) and
1.4372MHz (error 43.72%), respective- ly. As we
increase (resp. Decrease) the capacitance value, the
resonant frequency is lower (resp. higher). The
low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass responses are shown in Figs. 8 to 12 with the
frequency range from 10Hz to 302MHz (low-pass),
10Hz to 110MHz (band-pass), 10Hz to 66MHz
(high-pass), 10Hz to 77.6MHz (band-reject), and
10Hz to 237MHz (all-pass). The higher the operation
frequency, the larger the distortion (such as the
higher the peak) due to the parasitic effect.

4. Conclusion
The single current conveyor based universal active
current-mode filter using one fewer capacitor and
three/four fewer resistors than the previous ones is
proposed. Due to the controllability of the finite input
resistance at the X terminal of a second- generation
current controlled conveyor (CCCII) by its bias
current, the five generic filtering (low-pass band-pass,
high-pass, band-reject, and all-pass) signals can be
obtained by proper choice of the three input current
signals. TSMC 0.35 μ m process H-Spice
simulations are included to validate the theoretical
predictions of the filtering performance component
sensitivities, and the technique to correct the
deviation

1 Introduction
In 1989, it was presented that circuits based on current
amplifiers operate at higher signal bandwidths, greater
linearity and larger dynamic range, than their
voltage-based circuit counter-parts [1]. Current-mode
circuits have emerged over the last two decades as an
important class of analogue circuits. A universal
(low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass) current-mode (current input and current
output) biquad which employs seven second-
generation current conveyors (CCIIs) in addition to
two grounded capacitors and three grounded resistors
was presented [2]. This biquad suffers from the
following two disadvantages: requirement of one
matching condition to realize an all-pass signal, and no
orthogonal control of 0  and Q. The improved
universal filter does not need any component matching
conditions and enjoys the orthogonal control of 0
and Q although with the same structure complexity [3].
The condensed universal filter employs only five CCIIs
in addition to two grounded capacitors and three
grounded resistors [4] was proposed which enjoys the
advantageous features: (i) no component matching, and
(ii) the independent control of 0  and Q. The active
component count of the universal filter was reduced to
four but with the addition of one more grounded
capacitor [5, 6], or using two floating capacitors and
two floating resistors [7], or employing two grounded
capacitors and two grounded resistors [8]. Then, a high
output impedance multifunction filter employing three
CCIIs, two grounded/floating capacitors and three
grounded/ floating resistors was presented [9] which
cannot enjoy low active sensitivities as high quality
factor is necessary. And then, a versatile
multi-input-multi-output universal biquad structure
was supplied using three current conveyors, two
grounded capacitors, and two grounded resistors,
which still has the two advantages: no orthogonal
control of 0  and Q and the limitation for high
frequency operation [10]. The last universal filter was
improved to be an insensitive one using three dual
output current conveyors, two grounded capacitors,
and three grounded resistors which, again, suffered
from the limitation for high frequency operation [11].
The current-mode universal biquad without any
matching conditions was condensed to the three-input
and three-output  structure with the minimum number
of components, two plus type CCIIs, two grounded
capacitors, and two grounded resistors [12]. The
single-current conveyor-based universal biquads with
low quality factor [13] or high quality factor [14] were
proposed using three capacitors and four/five resistors.
The five generic filter (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass,
band-reject, and all-pass) signals are obtained by
adjusting the values of one grounded capacitor and one
grounded resistor appropriately. In this paper, a new
current-mode universal biquad employing a single
third-generation current conveyor (CCIII) [15], two
grounded capacitors, and two grounded/floating
resistors is presented whose structure is much simpler
than the previous two single-current conveyor-based
universal biquads [13, 14]. Three input signals and the
variable grounded R2 determine the five different
generic filtering signals obtained from the output
terminal. H-Spice simulation using 0.35μm process is
used to validate the theoretical predictions of the new
simple universal biquad including its five generic
filtering output signals, low individual component
sensitivities, and show the sensitivity frequency
3component, C1, C2, G1, G2, and the active parameter
v are lower than 0.5, very small value, but the
sensitivity of Q to the active parameters, iy and iz ,
depends on the magnitudes of the numerator and the
denominator of (12) and (13). The universal active
current filter shown in Fig. 1 is then insensitive to the
passive component.
3 H-spice Simulations
The filtering performance of the new universal active
current filter shown in Fig. 1 is shown in Figs. 3 to 7
by the TSMC035 level-49 H-Spice simulation (using
the CMOS implementation of the CCIII [15], shown
in Fig. 2, with the supply voltages VBdd=1.65V, and
VBss=-1.65V, and W/L=5μ/1μ and 10μ/1μ for NMOS
and PMOS transistors, respectively), and with
element values RB1B11=9kΩ , RB2B121=9kΩ , and CB1B=25
pF(but 12.5pF for all-pass realization), CB2 B= 50 pF for
the 3dB frequency at 500kHz and CB1B=12.5 pF(but
6.25pF for all-pass realization), CB2B=25 pF for the
3dB frequency at 1MHz, respectively. The
simulation results of the 3dB frequency of the
low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass output signals are 567kHz (error 13.5%) and
1.107MHz (error 10.7%); 513kHz (error 2.57%) and
1.023MHz (error 2.3%); 462kHz (error -7.6%) and
0.956MHz (error -4.41%); 513kHz (error 2.57%) and
1.047MHz (error 4.7%); and 733kHz (error 46.6%)
and 1.46MHz (error 46%), respectively. As we
increase (resp. decrease) the capacitance value, the
resonant frequency is lower (resp. higher). The
low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass responses are shown in Figs. 8 to 12 with the
frequency range from 10Hz to 51MHz (low-pass),
10Hz to 151MHz (band-pass), 10Hz to 127MHz
(high-pass), 10Hz to 115MHz (band-reject), and
10Hz to 15MHz (all-pass). The higher the operation
frequency, the larger the distortion (such as the
higher the peak) due to the parasitic effect.

The sensitivity simulations of the resonant-frequency
to each passive component for low-pass, band-pass,
high-pass, band-reject, and all-pass output signals are
shown in Figs. 13 to 17, respectively. The sensitivity
frequency responses of the 3dB or central frequency
of the low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject,
and all-pass output signals are shown in Figs. 18 to
22. As can be seen, the sensitivities of the low-pass,
band-pass, band-reject, and all-pass signals are very
low (lower than 0.5), and only the high-pass (resp.
low-pass) sensitivity of the 3dB frequency to the
capacitance C2 (resp. C1) is a little bit larger (the
absolute value is about 0.95 and 0.8, respectively).
Moreover, the component sensitivities are nearly
fixed at a constant from 10Hz to 100kHz, and varied
as the operating frequency is higher than 100kHz.

1 Introduction
In 1991, a current-feedback amplifier (CFA), which is
equivalent to a plus-type second generation current
conveyor (CCII) following a voltage buffer [1], was
proposed. In 1994, Chang  et al. [2] presented a
voltage-mode notch, low-pass, and band-pass filter
using three CFAs, which are equivalent to three
plus-type second-generation current conveyors and
three voltage buffers, six active elements in total. In
1994 and 1995, Soliman [3] and Senani et al. [4]
proposed two different types of Kerwin-Huelsman-
Newcomb equivalent biquads. Each realizes low-pass,
band-pass, and high-pass filter transfer functions, using
five plus/minus-type second-generation current
conveyors (CCIIs), two capacitors and six or seven
resistors, respectively. In 1995, Celma et al. Presented
a voltage-mode universal biquad using three CCIIs,
and three voltage followers [5], still six active elements
in total. Therefore, before 1996, voltage-mode
CCII-based biquads were realized by employing five to
six active elements. In 1997, Horng et al. [6] proposed
a voltage-mod multifunction filter, using four CCIIs,
but three capacitors, and five resistors. In the same year,
Chang [7] presented five voltage-mode multifunction
biquadratic filters, each of which employs four CCIIs,
two grounded capacitors, and three to five resistors. In
1999, Chang and Lee [8] proposed a simpler
voltage-mode low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filter.
This filter employed only two compound current
conveyors, two grounded capacitors, and three
floating/grounded resistors. Recently, a  low-pass,
band-pasas, high-pass, and band-reject biquad filter
was presented using one fully differential current
conveyor (FDCCII), which is a very big active element,
two grounded capacitors, and two grounded resistors
[9]. The first universal (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass,
band-reject, and all-pass, simultaneously)
voltage-mode biquad was realized using two
differential difference current conveyor (DDCCs), two
grounded capacitors, and two resistors [10]. As to
high-order current conveyor-based fulters, in 1995, Gü
nes and Anday employed 3n+2 CCIIs, n+1 grounded
capacitors and 3n-1 grounded resistors to realize an
nth-order voltage-mode general filters structure [11].
In [12], it was shown that n+1 CCIIs, n grounded
capacitors and resistors are needed to realize an
nth-order current-mode low-pass filter structure. In
1996, Acar replaced grounded passive elements with
floating passive elements to reduce the number of
active elements (CCIIs) for realizing voltage transfer
functions [13-16]. Firstly, Acar employed n grounded
or floating capacitors, n floating resistors, and n CCIIs
to realize an nth-order voltage0mode low-pass transfer
function [13]. Secondly, Acar employed n grounded or
floating capacitors, 2n+1 floating resistors, 2 grounded
resistors, and n+1 CCIIs to realize an nth-order
voltage-mode all-pass transfer function [14]. The same
author also showed that the CFA could be used in place
of the CCII to realize an nth-order voltage-mde general
transfer function [15]. Finally, Acar and Özoguz
employed n grounded capacitors, 2n+2 floating and
one grounded resistors, and n+2 CCIIs to realize an
nth-order voltage-mode general transfer function [16].
Therefore, none of the single-current conveyor-based
universal voltage filter is proposed since the recently
reported one [9] cannot realize all-pass output signal
and the other one [10] uses two active elements, i.e.,
two DDCCs, although it can simultaneously realize all
3band-reject, and all-pass responses are shown in Figs.
8 to 12 with the frequency range from 100Hz to
49MHz (low-pass), 100Hz to 18MHz (band-pass),
100Hz to 28.6MHz (high-pass), 100Hz to 93.3MHz
(band-reject), and 100Hz to 33.4MHz (all-pass). The
higher the operation frequency, the larger the
distortion (such as the higher the peak) due to the
parasitic effect.

the 3dB or central frequency of the low-pass,
band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and all-pass output
signals are shown in Figs. 18 to 22. As can be seen,
the sensitivities of the all-pass and band-reject output
signals are very low (lower than 0.5), and the others
(low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass) have low
sensitivities (lower than 1.0)

The single current feedback amplifier (CFA) based
universal active voltage-mode filter using two
capacitors and two resistors, unlike the recently
reported two biquads, one of which cannot
synthesize the all-pass output signal and the other of
which employs two active DDCCs, is proposed. The
five generic filtering (low-pass band-pass, high-pass,
band-reject, and all-pass) signals can be obtained by
proper choice of the three input voltage signals.
TSMC 0.35 μm process H-Spice simulations are

output filtering signals, and show the low component
sensitivities and the sensitivity frequency responses.

linearity and larger dynamic range, than their

circuits have emerged over the last two decades as an

active elements, the current conveyors (CC) and the
operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), are
used in the active filter design, especially in the design
of universal active current filters, in the past two
decades.
A universal (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass,
band-reject, and all-pass) current-mode (current input
and current output) biquad which employs seven
second- generation current conveyors (CCIIs) in
addition to two grounded capacitors and three

suffers from the following two disadvantages:

output impedance multifunction filter employing three
CCIIs, two grounded/floating capacitors and three
grounded/ floating resistors was presented [9] which
cannot enjoy low active sensitivities as high quality
factor is necessary. And then, a versatile multi-input-
multi-output universal biquad structure was supplied
using three current conveyors, two grounded capacitors,
and two grounded resistors, which still has the two
advantages: no orthogonal control of 0  and Q and the
limitation for high frequency operation [10]. The last
universal filter was improved to be an insensitive one
using three dual output current conveyors, two
grounded capacitors, and three grounded resistors
which, again, suffered from the limitation for high
frequency operation [11]. The current-mode universal
biquad without any matching conditions was
condensed to the three-input and three-output  structure
with the minimum number of components, two plus
type CCIIs, two grounded capacitors, and two
grounded resistors [12]. The single-current conveyor-
based universal biquads with low quality factor [13] or
high quality factor [14] were proposed using three
capacitors and four/five resistors. The five generic
filter (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass) signals are obtained by adjusting the values of
one grounded capacitor and one grounded resistor
appropriately.
A second-order current-mode filter using four
operational tansconductanceamplifiers (OTAs) and
two grounded capacitors was presented in 1996 [15]. It
can realize low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, and
band-reject filtering functions but without all-pass
filtering function unless component matching

3 H-spice Simulations
The filtering performance of the new universal active
current filter shown in Fig. 1 is shown in Figs. 3 to 7
by the TSMC035 level-49 H-Spice simulation (using
the CMOS implementation of the OTA [21], shown
in Fig. 2, with the supply voltages VBdd=1.65V, and
VBss=-1.65V, and W/L=5μ/0.35μ and 10μ/0.35μ for
NMOS and PMOS transistors, respectively), and
with element values RB1B11=9kΩ, gB2B121=222.14μS, (but
gB2B121=444.28μS, for al-pass only)and CB1B=50 pF,
CB2 B=50 pF for the 3dB frequency at 500kHz and
CB1B=25pF, CB2B=25pF for the 3dB frequency at 1MHz,
respectively. The simulation results of the 3dB
frequency of the low-pass, band-pass, high-pass,
band-reject, and all-pass output signals are 499.6kHz
(error -0.09%) and 1.0007MHz (error 0.07%);
501.2kHz (error 0.24%) and 1.000MHz (error
0.00%); 497.6kHz (error -0.47%) and 0.991MHz
(error -0.95%); 501.2kHz (error 0.24%) and
1.000MHz (error 0.00%); and 699.8kHz (error
40.0%) and 1.396MHz (error 39.6%), respectively.
As we increase (resp. decrease) the capacitance value,
the resonant frequency is lower (resp. higher). The
low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and
all-pass responses are shown in Figs. 8 to 12 with the
frequency range from 10Hz to 233MHz (low-pass),
10Hz to 589MHz (band-pass), 10Hz to 248MHz
(high-pass), 10Hz to 115MHz (band-reject), and
10Hz to 113MHz (all-pass). The higher the operation
frequency, the larger the distortion (such as the
higher the peak) due to the parasitic effect.

The sensitivity simulations of the resonant-frequency
to each passive component for low-pass, band-pass,
high-pass, band-reject, and all-pass output signals are
shown in Figs. 13 to 17, respectively. The sensitivity
frequency responses of the 3dB or central frequency
of the low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-reject,
and all-pass output signals are shown in Figs. 18 to
22. As can be seen, the sensitivities of the low-pass,
band-pass, high-pass, and all-pass signals are low
(lower than 1.0), and only the band-reject (or notch)
sensitivity of the central frequency to the resistance
R1 is a little bit larger as the operating frequency is
higher than 200MHz (see Fig. 21).

2 Universal Active Current Biquad
The universal active current filter with a single
differential voltage current conveyor (DVCC), two
grounded capacitors, and two resistors is shown in
Fig.1.

The new single-current conveyor-based universal
active current filter is shown in Fig. 1 using one fewer
capacitor and two/three fewer resistors than the
previous ones [13, 14]. Circuit analysis for Fig. 1

The specifications of (2) give the following five
generic filtering signals.
(i) Low-pass: Iin3=Iin2=0, and Iin1=Iin;
(ii) Band-pass: Iin3=0, and Iin2=-Iin1=Iin or
Iin2=-Iin1=-Iin;
(iii) High-pass: Iin1=0, Iin3=Iin2=Iin, and
(C1+C2)G2=C1G1;

(C1+C2)G2=C1G1;

small value, but the sensitivity of Q to the active

64. Conclusion
The single current conveyor based universal active
current-mode filter using one fewer capacitor and
two/three fewer resistors than the previous ones is
proposed. The five generic filtering (low-pass
band-pass, high-pass, band-reject, and all-pass)
signals can be obtained by proper choice of the three
input current signals and the adjustment of one of the
two resistances. TSMC 0.35 μm process H-Spice
simulations are included to validate the theoretical
predictions of filtering signals, component
sensitivities, and sensitivity frequency responses..
