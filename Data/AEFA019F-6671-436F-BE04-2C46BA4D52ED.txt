modifying the structures of coaxial connectors or microstrip lines for better
matching of the electromagnetic field distributions at the transitions. One
technique is to create a hole on the ground plane of the microstrip line and
then to place this hole above another bigger hole in the supporting base-
plate underneath the ground plane [6]. This arrangement is located near the
transition to reduce the inherent capacitance of the transition to minimize
the influence of the discontinuity. However, the size of the hole varies for
different coaxial connectors and substrates selected for the microstrip line.
A connector designed by Eisenhart lowered its center pin gradually to trans-
form a coaxial field distribution to a microstrip field distribution [7]. The size
of the center pin was also tapered to maintain 50 Ω for impedance matching.
The problem with this technique is the cost of the mechanical fabrication
involved. Another technique featured a tapered region at the launcher end
of the connector [8]. In this region, the distance between conductors de-
creases linearly while maintaining an outer to inner conductor diameter ratio
constant and corresponding to a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. This con-
figuration can perform the field transformation between a coaxial line and
a microstrip line as well, but it still suffers from the fabrication cost of the
connector. Coaxial step-transitions filled with dielectric or air are common in
commercial products [9] to provide a smooth transition from a bigger coaxial
connector to a thinner substrate. However, these transition structures are
complicated and require higher precision to manufacture, adding up to their
cost.
In this report, a design for coaxial-to-microstrip transitions is presented.

Figure 3: Comparison on the simulation results of the conventional design
and the proposed design for SMA-to-microstrip transitions.
A metallic ring is introduced between a coaxial cable/connector and a mi-
crostrip line to serve as a buffer for the transformation of the electromagnetic
field distributions of the two transmission lines. An SMA connector is em-
ployed for a practical design example of coaxial-to-microstrip transitions.
Optimization of the design parameters of the metallic ring is performed to
maximize the 1-dB passband of the transition. It is shown that the passband
is increased by more than 60% for this example. Further study on the tran-
sitions between different coaxial cables/connectors and planar transmissions,
such as microstrip lines and coplanar waveguides (CPW), on different sub-
strates is conducted. The influence of the fabrication and assembly errors of
the transitions on their performance in terms of the 1-dB passband is also
examined. The simulation results indicate that the proposed design serves
equivalently well for the aforementioned transitions. The performance is not
susceptible to any reasonable fabrication and assembly errors of the transi-
tions. A finite element method-based commercial CAD package – Ansoft’s
HFSS1 – is selected to conduct all the required simulations because of its ac-
curacy in the computation involving 3-D structures. Some of the simulation
results are verified experimentally for their validity.

upper limit of the 1-dB passband achieved by the proposed design. Thus,

line does not exist. The cutoff frequency of the first higher-order mode of

3.1 Variations in Ring Dimensions
Two most critical design parameters of the proposed ring structure are its
thickness and the diameter of its through hole. Fig. 7 shows that the thick-
ness of the ring ranging from 2 mm to 6 mm gives nearly the same 1-dB
passband, which is the advantage of the proposed design in terms of the fab-
rication errors in ring thickness. A ring thinner than 2 mm would reduce the
1-dB passband because of less region for electromagnetic field transformation.
A thicker ring is not suitable for the design of a commercial connector. Fig.
8 indicates that the inner diameter of the ring within the range from 3.51
mm to 4.71 mm can provide acceptable frequency responses of the transition,
another advantage of the proposed design regarding the possible fabrication
errors in the size of the through hole. The ring with a larger through hole
would deteriorate the performance of the transition compared to the one with
a smaller through hole. However, a small through hole is very likely to short
the strip inside to the ring. This part of study indicates that the proposed
design allows more tolerances for the metallic ring in its fabrication process.
3.2 Variations in PCB Properties
The applications of the proposed transitions to microstrip lines on substrates
of different thickness and dielectric constant are examined here. A thinner
substrate is chosen for this study since thicker substrates are normally not
considered for higher-frequency applications. The proposed SMA connec-
tor is connected to a microstrip line on a 0.3 mm thick RO4003 substrate
with the same ring structure. Fig. 17 demonstrates that, compared to the
conventional design, the proposed design can improve the high-frequency
performance of the transition significantly. The application of the proposed
transition to a microstrip line on a substrate with a higher dielectric constant
is examined next. A substrate with a dielectric constant of 10.2 is chosen for
this study. Fig. 18 shows the comparison between the proposed design and
the conventional design for the transition to a microstrip line on a 0.81 mm
thick substrate of ǫ
r
= 10.2. The 1-dB passband is improved from 14.5 GHz
to 22.3 GHz, a more than 50% increase. Contribution of the higher-order
modes of the microstrip line to the passband responses of the transition is
excluded since the cutoff frequencies of the first higher-order mode of the
microstrip lines in these two examples are much higher than the upper limit
of the passband according to (1). This part of study is to demonstrate that
the proposed design can apply to the transitions between SMA connectors
and microstrip lines on various substrates.

quency responses of the proposed transition subjected to a 25% under-etching
and a 10% over-etching errors, respectively. As can be seen from the figure,
the 25% under-etching error has a negligible impact on the performance of
the transition in contrast to the severe passband insertion loss caused by the
10% over-etching. This problem caused by the over-etching errors can be
solved by taping conductive foil on the over-etched part of the ground plane,
as shown in Fig. 21. Under the simulation environment of the selected 3-D
EM simulator, HFSS, the results of the transition after taping conductive
foil on the over-etched portions are identical to the results of a faultless one.
To verify this solution for the over-etching problems, a back-to-back con-
nection of two proposed transitions subjected to a 10% over-etching error
is prepared. This back-to-back connection is measured after taping copper
foil on the over-etched area; and the results are compared to the measured
data of the back-to-back connected faultless transitions. Fig. 22 shows that
the repaired transition has almost the same performance as the faultless one
does.
The influence of the transverse shift of the two slots with respect to the
microstrip line on the performance of the transition is investigated next.
The misalignment percentage is defined as the amount of the transverse shift
of the two slots divided by the maximum allowed misalignment, which is
the distance when the center pin is about to lose contact with the strip.
This maximum allowed misalignment is 0.938 mm for this design example,
half of the strip width. Variation of the characteristic impedance of the

Contribution from the higher-order modes of both transmission lines to
the 1-dB passband responses of the transition does not exist since the cut-
off frequencies of the first higher-order modes of the .141 semi-rigid cable
and the microstrip line are 33.7 GHz and 74 GHz, respectively. Other semi-
rigid cables of different diameters were also examined for the 1-dB passband
enhancement of their transitions to microstrip lines. Simulation results indi-
cate that the proposed design can significantly improve the 1-dB passband
of the transitions between microstrip lines and smaller-diameter semi-rigid
cables, such as .047 and .085. These are the semi-rigid cables mainly used
for high-frequency applications.
4.3 SMA-to-CPW Transitions
For the past few decades, CPW have been extensively used in many high-
frequency planar circuit designs because of their easy integration with active
components and surface mount devices, no need to drill holes through the
substrate to reach the ground plane. Another advantage of this transmis-
sion line is its ease to work with probe stations during measurements. The
performance of CPW is comparable to or sometimes even better than that
of microstrip lines in terms of dispersion and losses. The proposed design is
applied to SMA-to-CPW transitions, as shown in Fig. 27, to enhance their 1-
dB passband. A flange-mount SMA connector attached with a metallic ring

suitable for transitions between various coaxial cables/connectors and planar
transmission lines. Its performance is not susceptible to any reasonable fab-
rication or assembly errors of the transitions. In addition, the design can be
packaged into a commercial product for many high-frequency applications.
