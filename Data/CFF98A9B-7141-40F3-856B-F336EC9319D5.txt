Abstract 
 
In  the  first  Mozart  Effect  study,  Rauscher,  Shaw,  and  Ky  (1993)  found  that  
exposure to a Mozart sonata enhanced performance on visuo-spatial tasks. In this 
study, we sought to examine whether there was such an effect on three spatial ability 
sub-factors, namely spatial visualization factor (the paper folding test), spatial relation 
factor  (card  rotation  test),  and  perceptual  speed  factor  (hidden  pattern  test).  In  a  
between-subject design, 90 participants were exposed to 10 minutes periods of Mozart 
Sonata, Bach, or silence. After listening to a music stimulus or silence period, 
participants  completed  three  spatial  tests.  The  treatment  conditions  did  not  yield  
significant difference between groups. Results from all three spatial tests did not 
support the Mozart effect.  
 
Keywords: Mozart effect, background music, spatial ability, design performance

1.1   Spatial ability  
It is said that spatial ability is important in designers. However, what is spatial ability? 
Spatial ability may be defined as the ability to generate, retain, retrieve and transform 
well-structured visual images [7]. Halpern [8] states that the term “visual-spatial 
abilities” it is not an easy term to define, because it is not a unitary concept. McGee [9] 
proposed that there are two factors of spatial ability: spatial visualization and spatial 
orientation. Spatial visualization refers to the ability to manipulate, rotate, change the 
position in mind of an object depicted as a picture. Spatial orientation is proposed to 
measure someone’s ability to image the appearance of objects from different 
perspectives. Thurstone [10] suggested three space factors named mental rotation(S1), 
spatial visualization(S2), and spatial perception(S3). Mental rotation was described as 
the process of recognizing an object from different angles. Spatial visualization was 
imagining the movement of parts of a configuration. Spatial perception emerged as 
having to do with body orientation. Lohman [7] argues that there are three factors for 
spatial ability: spatial visualization, spatial orientation, and speeded rotation. Spatial 
visualization is the ability to manipulate objects in imagination or the ability to 
comprehend imaginary movements in a three dimensional space. Spatial orientation 
requires only a mental rotation of configuration. Speeded rotation is the ability by the 
speed in manipulating simple visual patterns such as mental rotations. According to 
Carroll [11], the spatial ability sub-factors include: spatial visualization, spatial 
relation, closure speed, closure flexibility and perceptual speed. Spatial visualization, 
spatial relation and perceptual speed are frequently mentioned sub-factors.  
The most extensively studied factor is the spatial visualization factor [12]. Tests 
that identify this factor involve “processes of apprehending, encoding, and mentally 
manipulating spatial forms” ( as cited in [13] ). The spatial relation factor is similar to 
spatial visualization. It also requires mental transformations but differ in that it 
involves manipulations of two-dimensional objects that can be completed in a single 
step. This factor tends to emphasize speed. Perceptual speed involves no spatial 
transformations and primarily requires rapid matching of visual patterns. 
Psychometric tests that identify this factor assess individual differences in the speed 
or efficiency with which one can make relatively simple perceptual judgments [11]. 
These three factors are moderately correlated with one another. In fact, depending on 
the tasks included in the analysis, some factor analysis studies have failed to find a 
clear distinction between the Spatial Visualization and Spatial Relations factors 
(Lohman, 1988; Carroll, 1993) (cited in [13]). 
 
1.2   Associations between musical and spatial ability  
A number of studies have suggested that listening to Mozart’s work may temporarily 
increase spatial abilities. There have been several studies that replicated the Mozart 
effect study [14] [15] [16]. For example, Rideout and Taylor [15] used the same 
Mozart sonata and a relaxation instruction. They found that performance on paper 
folding test and cutting test were significant higher for the Mozart group than for the 
relaxation group. Rideout, Dougherty, and Wernert [16] compared Mozart sonata to 
2.2   Materials  
Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos, K.448 and Bach BWV 916 were used in the 
experimental condition. The musical excerpts consisted of 10 minutes from Mozart 
sonata K.448, or from Bach BWV 916. For the Mozart sonata, we recorded the entire 
first section (8 minutes and 24 seconds) and replayed it until 10 minutes were 
accumulated. The Bach BWV 916 was built in the same way. 
Three spatial ability tests were used in this study. The spatial visualization factor 
was evaluated using a paper folding test. The spatial relation factor was evaluated 
using the card rotation test. The perceptual speed factor was evaluated using the 
hidden patterns test [25]. 
Paper folding test: This test consisted of two parts, each of which has 10 items. 
Participants were required to mentally fold a piece of paper and punch a hole in it. 
Participants were asked to determine the position of the hole when the paper is 
unfolded. For each part the participants were given 2.5 minutes to complete the task. 
The score was the result of the total number of correct answers minus the number of 
incorrect answers. 
Card rotation test: A 2D mental rotation test in which participants were required to 
determine whether rotated figures were identical to the original figure or were a 
mirror image. This test consisted of two parts, each of which had 10 rows of eight test 
figures. The participants were given 2 minutes to complete each part of the test. The 
score was the result of the total number of correct answers minus the number of 
incorrect answers. 
Hidden patterns test: This test also consists of two parts, with each part containing 
200 figures composed of line drawings. Participants were asked to identify whether 
the model pattern was embedded in each test figure. The participants were given 1.5 
minutes to complete each part of the test, and were asked to respond as quickly and as 
accurately as possible. The test was scored using the total number of correct answers 
minus the number of incorrect answers.  
2.3   Procedure  
Following completion of consent procedures, the procedure and the purpose of the 
study were explained to the participants. 
In the Mozart and Bach groups, experimenter told participants that they would hear 
a music piece for approximately 10 minutes, and while the music played, participants 
should sit  quietly and listen to the music. In the silence group, they sat in silence for 
10 minutes. A computer with windows media player was used to play the music for 
the  Mozart  Sonata  and  Bach  BWV  916.  The  music’s  volume  was  adjusted  for  
comfortable listening. After listening or silence period, participants completed the 
paper folding test, card rotation test, and hidden patterns test. Before taking the three 
tests, each participant was instructed to take a tutorial followed by test. There was a 
time limit of 5 minutes for paper folding test, 4 minutes for card rotation test, and 3 
minutes for hidden patterns test. The experiment took an average of 15-20 minutes to 
complete. 
4   Discussion 
The treatment conditions (Mozart Sonata, Bach BWV 916, and silence) did not yield 
significant difference between groups. This is inconsistent with the finding of Rauscer 
et al. [1]. But, it is consistent with reports from several studies ( e.g. [19] [20] [21] ). 
One explanation for not finding a Mozart effect could be related to the use of different 
dependent measures. The paper fording and cutting tasks used by Rauscher et al. [1] 
in their study were the “Visualization” tests [19]. The most employed test to measure 
spatial visualization task is paper folding test. In this study, the paper folding test did 
not found a significant difference between groups. In conclusion, this study found no 
evidence to support the Mozart effect. Listening to Mozart’s music does not enhance 
spatial ability.

The concept of universal design is to design products that are usable by and effective for a 
broad spectrum of users. Previous universal design studies have focused on the products 
themselves, thus there has been relatively little research into the emotional response. The 
purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between the principles of universal 
design and user emotions (pleasure, arousal and dominance). After viewing the Universal 
Design Award-winning products, participants completed the Consumer Product Universal 
Design Scales (Beecher & Paquet, 2005) and their emotional response was assessed using 
the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM, Lang, 1980). The structural equation modeling 
analysis revealed that “Flexibility in Use” has a positive effect on pleasure and arousal 
scales, and “Adaptability to the User's Pace” has a positive effect on the arousal scale. 
Therefore designers should consider the “Flexibility in Use” factor to elicit pleasure and 
arousal responses; similarly, providing “Adaptability to the User's Pace” can enhance 
dominance-inducing design.  
 
Introduction 
In recent years, several concepts of design share the fundamental philosophy of 
human-centred design, such as universal design and emotional design. Universal design is defined 
as “the design of products and environments to be usable to the greatest extent possible by people of 
all ages and abilities”(Story, Mueller, & Mace, 1998). Universal Design focuses on usability with an 
emphasis on the need and interest of all users. This approach, however, does not take into 
consideration the users' emotional value. This research aimed at studying relationships between 
universal design and universal, extending universal design from focusing on the product itself to 
users’ emotional responses. 
Previous studies suggested a positive correlation between aesthetics and usability. Kurosu and 
Kashimura(1995) conducted an experiment on the aesthetics and apparent usability of an ATM user 
students from the National Kaohsiung Normal University. There were 133 from the department of 
industrial design and 68 from other non-design departments. 
Materials: Three award-winning products were chosen as stimuli from the Universal Design 
Award of Free Universe Education Foundation, Taipei. The Consumer Product Universal Design 
Scales was employed as the measure of universal design. The scales consist of 44 Likert-type items, 
ranging from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) 
was used to measure emotional responses in present study. 
Procedure: The experiments were conducted in small groups of 5-6 in classrooms. After the 
purpose and the procedure of the experiment were explained, each subject was given a handout. 
Subjects were asked to filled in general demographic information. Subjects then viewed each 
stimulus and evaluated with the Consumer Product Universal Design Scales and the SAM scales. 
The experiment took 40-50 minutes to complete. 
 
Results 
A two-step approach (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988) to SEM was used, and a confirmatory 
factor  analyses  was  carried  out  using  LISREL8.8.  In  the  first  step,  CFA was  performed to  test  the  
reliability and construct validity of the proposed model. In the second step, structural equation 
modeling (SEM) with latent variables was tested to examine the correlation between the factors of 
universal design and the three dimensions of the PADˤ  
Based on the results of the CFA, the overall model fit was evaluated statistically by the 
chi-square test and heuristically using a number of model-fit-indices. The chi-square test of 
measurement model was significant, Ȥ2Ȑ806, N = 201ȑ= 2212.7, p < .001, which indicated that the 
model did not fit the data. However, because the chi-square statistic is very sensitive to sample size, 
therefore, alternative fit indices should also be considered (Bearden, Sharma, & Teel, 1982; Hair, 
Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998). As indicated by other model-fit-indices (CFI = .96, NNFI = .96, 
RMSEA = .238, SRMR = .095) the measurement model did not fit the data well. 
Because of the results of the CFA indicated that the initial model was unsatisfactory, and 
model modification was required. As the “Consumer Product Universal Design Scales”, some of the 
factors include a lot of items. For example, there are 11 items in low physical effort factor. Noar 
(2003) suggested that 4 to 6 good items would be enough to measure a construct robustly. Therefore, 
these items were deleted to improve validity. Based on the results of the first CFA, six items were 
deleted because of their low factor loadings and high suggestion of modification indices provided 
by LISREL. When six items were deleted, CFA was conducted again. The chi-square was 
carried out as the same factor. 
For the structure model of pleasure, based on model-fit-indices (Ȥ2炷576, N = 201炸= 1294.09, 
p < .001, CFI = .97, NNFI = .97, RMSEA = .079, SRMR = .066), the estimated model provided a 
good fit to the data. Factor loading of the structure model are summarized in Table 2. As the table 2 
clearly shows, only factor 3(flexibility in use) and pleasure, there is a significant factor loading. For 
the structure model of arousal, the fit indices for this model were all quite good (Ȥ2炷576, N = 201炸
= 1264.01, p < .001, CFI = .97, NNFI = .97, RMSEA = .077, SRMR = .067). Only factor 
3(flexibility in use) and arousal, there is a significant factor loading. For the structure model of 
dominance, the fit indices for this model were all quite good (Ȥ2炷576, N = 201炸= 1256.05, p < .001, 
CFI = .97, NNFI = .97, RMSEA = .077, SRMR = .066). Only factor 4(adaptability to user pace) and 
dominance, there is a significant factor loading.

Conclusions 
The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between the principles of universal 
design and user emotions. Results of structural equation modeling showed that ‘Flexibility in use’ 
has a positive effect on pleasure and arousal scales; and “Adaptability to the User's Pace” has a 
positive effect on the arousal scale.  
Designers should consider the “Flexibility in Use” factor to elicit pleasurable and arousing 
responses. There are four items associated with ‘Flexibility in use’: 1. I can use this product in 
whatever way(s) are efficient for me. 2. I can use this product in whatever way(s) are effective for 
me.  3.  I  think  this  product  looks  attractive.  4.  I  have  choices  in  the  way  I  can  use  this  product.  
Therefore, in order to elicit pleasurable and arousal responses, design should be efficient, effective 
attractive and allows multiple ways of use.  
Designers should consider the “Adaptability to the User's Pace” factor to elicit dominant 
responses. The four items associated with ‘Adaptability to the User's Pace are: 1. I have a choice in 
the speed of use of this product. 2. I can use this product as slowly as I want. 3. This product works
