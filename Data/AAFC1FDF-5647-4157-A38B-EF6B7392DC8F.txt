Abstract － In the SS/TDMA systems, the total duration of transmission time in a TDMA 
frame suffers degradation under heterogeneous traffic matrices. A station-grouping algorithm 
is proposed for the SS/TDMA system with contiguous beams. The algorithm aims to 
decrease the heterogeneity of the traffic matrix. After reorganizing the traffic matrix, the 
earth stations are assigned to the proper beams by their tunable transmitters and receivers. As 
shown in the simulations, the proposed algorithm offers a prominent performance on both 
switching mode and transmission time. It is an efficient solution to improve the system 
performance under heterogeneous traffic matrices. Especially, it could provide a superior 
performance as the number of transponders gets large. 
Key words: SS/TDMA, contiguous beams, traffic matrix 
 
I. Introduction 
Satellite systems have been rediscovered to complement terrestrial networks to provide a 
worldwide access to handle highly bursty internet and multimedia services [1]-[5]. In this 
application, the satellite system must support not only the circuit switched traffic but also the 
packet services with highly bursty traffic patterns. For such services, the system is feasible to 
operate with the on-demand assignment control to provide efficient transponder utilization [6, 
7]. In the demand assignment schemes, it requires an advanced switching technology and a 
signal processing in the satellite on-board. However, it directly impacts the cost, availability, 
and time-to- market [5]. 
demand from uplink beam i to downlink beam j, measured in units of time slot. Typically, a 
time slot is designed to encompass a number of message packets. The traffic scheduling 
problem then reduces to depict a way to decompose the traffic matrix D into distinct 
matrices, i.e. D = D1 + D2 +…+ DL, in such a way that each Di is called a switching matrix 
with at most one positive entry in each row and each column for avoiding conflict. Such a 
matrix represents a particular switching mode and the corresponding traffic being switched. 
The largest entry in a switching matrix Di dictates the duration of the switching mode and is 
called the switching duration of Di, denoted by Di .
 To maximize transponder utilization, 
one must minimize the total switching duration of switching matrices,

, also called 
transmission time [10]. Meanwhile, the number of switching modes, L, should be kept small 
because delay is caused during the change from one switching mode to the next one. The 
total duration of transmission time, F, in each TDMA frame can be written as LFF D  
, 
where L  represents the time spent in reconfiguring the switch with  representing the 
time spent per switching. 
The design of scheduling algorithms is the main concern to minimize the total duration of 
transmission time F. As mentioned in [13], minimizing F is a complex work that puts two 
interdependent parameters FD and L into account. Most previous studies, as [8]-[12], assume 
that τ is negligibly small in comparison with a slot time. Those algorithms for a given traffic 
matrix D aim to minimize the transmission time FD and, then, to reduce the number of 
switching modes L possibly. In such studies, it has been shown the transmission time for any 
feasible decomposition can always approach to the lower bond S, where

entries in column j of D, T is the total traffic in D and  x  means the smaller integer  x [10]. 
However, when the sum of entries in each row and column is the same (i.e. the uniform 
traffic pattern), the bound reaches to

condition of the uniform traffic pattern. 
On the other hand, the number of switching modes is bounded up to  for 
. The number of switching modes is with a least value of  when the 
condition M = N = K is held. In this paper, a system with K contiguous spot beams is 
considered to obtain the lowest switching number. In order to propose a station-grouping 
algorithm for the traffic matrix, in the system configuration, the contiguous beams are 
designed to overlap each other. In such consideration, the dominate purpose is to reduce the

Step 2: Rank the row (column) sums of the K rows (columns) in descending order, 
i.e.  (  where i(x) (j(x)) indicates the row 
(column) number in D with x representing the ordinal number in the rank. If more than two 
row (column) sums are with the same value, rank these row (column) sums according to the 
order of row (column) number. In the rank of the row (column) sums, orderly list the 
corresponding row (column) numbers as , called the beam 
number list.

The station grouping procedure with uplink (or downlink) beams is given in the following 
steps. 
Step 3: In the beam number list, choose the first row i(1) and, then, choose its adjacent 
row with a small row sum between row i(1)-1 and row i(1)+1. Assume  and 
therefore row i(1) and row i(1)+1 are chosen to do the next step. 
 RR
In other words, the zone overlapped with uplink beam i(1) and beam i(1)+1 has been 
chosen to do the next step. 
Step 4: In this overlap zone, try to exchange one station from beam i(1) and one station 
from beam i(1)+1. Then, count the difference of the two row sums in row i(1) and row 
i(1)+1, denoted

. There are earth stations covered with beam i(1) and with 
beam i(1)+1 in the overlap zone. It needs  times to exchange all stations between 
these two beams. Then, select the two stations that are with the least difference of  and 
 in all exchanges. Also, the difference should be smaller than the difference between

. Exchange the two rows corresponding with 
the two selected stations in 
D  and then re-count the two row sums in D. Then, go to Step 7. 
If it fails the station exchange, go to Step 5. 
Step 5: Choose the other adjacent row i(1)-1 instead of row i(1)+1 and Redo Step 4. If it 
fails the station exchange again, go to Step 6. 
Step 6: According to the beam number list shown in Step 2, orderly choose the next row 
i(x) instead of the first row i(1) and redo Step 3 until two stations are successfully exchanged 
in Step 4. If it fails the station exchange as the last row i(K) is chosen, end this algorithm.

V. Conclusion 
The number of switching modes and the transmission time suffer degradation in the 
SS/TDMA systems under the heterogeneous traffic patterns. In this paper, the main effort is 
to construct a best possible traffic matrix. In the studied system, the earth station is equipped 
with both tunable transmitter and receiver in the contiguous beams. The spot beam number is 
assumed to be equal to the transponder number. The assumption benefits with a least number 
of switching modes. The station-grouping algorithm is proposed to decrease the 
heterogeneity of traffic matrices. The algorithm reforms the traffic matrix by the way of 
tuning the transmitters/receivers in the earth stations. The reformed traffic matrix can 
approach the uniform traffic pattern. The simulation results show the performance 
comparison between the systems without/with the proposed algorithm. The main concerns 
on the system performance are the switching modes and transmission time. Although the 
proposed algorithm could not obviously provide a better performance on the switching 
modes when the number of transponder is less, it provides a superior performance when the 
transponder number gets larger. Moreover, it offers a prominent performance on 
transmission time.
