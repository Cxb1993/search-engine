Abstract 
 
 Isolation of fungal chitosan from waste mycelia of fermentation increases the value of 
fermentation byproduct. Three fungal strains, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus oryzae, and A. 
japonicus, were cultured in fermentor to produce gluconic acid, L-lactic acid and 
fructosytransferase, respectively. The waste mycelia were collected and used for chitosn 
extraction. After the completion of fermentation, 153 g/L of gluconic acid with a yield of 
102% (mass ratio of product to consumed substrate by %), 95 g/L of L-lactic acid with a yield 
of 79% and 4.72×105 unit/L of fructosyltransferase were obtained, respectively. The yield of 
chitosan is from 2.9 to 22.8 mg/L. The average number molecular weight of the fungal 
chitosan ranged from 25.1 kDa to 50.7 kDa with the polydisperity of 1.17-1.73 and the degree 
of deacetylation of 85.2-87.1%.

1. Introduction 
 
Chitosan, a linear polysaccharide, is composed of mainly β-D-glucosamine and smaller 
fraction of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine. Chitosan was used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, 
agricultural and food industries due to its physiochemical, bioactive and biocompatible 
properties (Kurita, 1998). Chitosan can be produced by deacetylation of chitin isolated from 
the shells of crustaceans such as crab and shrimp. However, the deacetylation of chitin at high 
temperature causes variability in properties of chitosan, such as the change of molecular 
weight and the wider degree of deacetylation, which are unfavored in many applications.  
An alternative source of chitosan is fugus. Chitosan has been isolated from cell walls of 
fungi such as Absidia coerulea (Wu et al., 2001), Absidia orchidis (Jaworska and Konieczna, 
2001), Aspergillus niger (Pochanavanich and Suntornsuk, 2002), Gongronella butleri (Nwe et 
al., 2002 ), Mucor rouxii (Synowiecki and Al-Khateeb, 1997) and Rhizupus oryzae (Tan et al., 
1996). There are advantages of fungal chitosan. The molecular weight and degree of 
deacetylation can be controlled by selecting fungal strains or varying the fermentation 
conditions. Production of fungal chitosan can be carried out by solid or submerged 
fermentation using agricultural wastes. The yield of chitosan can be enhanced by optimizing 
the fermentation conditions to increase the concentration of mycelia in culture or the content

2.3. L-Lactic acid fermentation 
For L-lactic acid production by R. oryzae, the seed culture medium was composed of 
(g/L): glucose 50, (NH4)2SO4 5, KH2PO4 0.5, MgSO4•7H2O 0.25, ZnSO4•7H2O 0.04 (pH 6) 
plus 5 % volume of 10 % (w/v) CaCO3 suspension. The production medium used in fermentor 
consisted of (g/L): glucose 120, Urea 2.5, KH2PO4 0.3, MgSO4•7H2O 0.25, ZnSO4•7H2O 0.04 
(pH 6). The fermentation was performed at 35˚C, 300 rpm and 2 vvm. During the 
fermentation, the pH of the culture decreased due to the production of lactic acid. A 30 % 
(w/w) CaCO3 slurry was automatically added into the fermentor to control the pH of the 
culture around 5. The fermentation was carried out until glucose in the culture broth had been 
depleted. 
 
2.4. Fructosyltransferase fermentation 
For fructosyltransferase production by A. japonicus, the seed culture medium was 
composed of (g/L): sucrose 50, yeast extract 20, K2HPO4 5. The production medium in 
fermentor was of the same composition as the seed culture medium except that sucrose 
concentration was increased to 200 g/L. The fermentation was performed at 30˚C, 400 rpm 
and 1 vvm and the pH was controlled around 6 by automatically adding 5 M NaOH. The 
fermentation was carried out until a maximal fructosyltransferase had been determined. 
 
2.5 Preparation of fructosyltransferase 
The fructosyltransferase of A. japonicus is a membrane-bound protein (Duan et al., 1993). 
After mycelia of A. japonicus were broken and the debris was recovered using a filter paper as 
previously described. The mycelial debris was suspended with 0.5% Triton X-114 in 0.1 M 
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) of a volume similar to culture in fermentor. The cell lysate 
containing fructosyltransferase was obtained with Cell Disruption Systems (Constant). After 
centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min, the supernatant fraction was collected and further 
concentrated using a hollow fiber filter module (Spectrum Laboratories) with a pore size of 50 
kDa. This concentrate was then lyophilized to obtain crude fructosyltransferase. 
 
2.6. Chitosan isolation 
After completion of fermentation, fungal mycelia were recovered by filtration using a 
150-mesh stainless sieve, and washed with water until a clear filtrate was obtained. The 
mycelia were resuspended in water and homogenized by a homogenizer (IKA) for 20 min. 
The mycelial debris was collected using a filter paper (Whatman 1) under suction. 
Chitosan was extracted with a method modified from Pochanavanich and Suntornsuk 
(2002) and Nwe and Stevens (2002). Mycelial debris was suspended with 30 folds 
(volume/dry cell weight) of 1 M NaOH. After autoclave at 121˚C for 15 min, the 
alkali-insoluble fraction was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min, washed 
with water to neutral (pH 7). The precipate was suspended with 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer 
 6
55˚C for 30 min. The enzyme reaction was terminated by heating the reaction mixture in 
boiling water for 15 min. The carbohydrate in the mixture was analyzed by HPLC. One unit 
of fructosyltransferase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce one 
micromole of 1-kestose per min. 
Molecular weight of chitosan was determined by GPC with a SB-804 HQ (8 × 300 mm) 
column (Shodex). The mobile phase was 0.5 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.7) at 0.3 mL/min. 
Pullulans (Shodex) with molecular weights in the range of 5.90 × 103 - 4.04 × 105 kDa were 
used as standards. The degree of deacetylation was determined by the modified 
first-derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry method (Muzzarelli and Rocchetti, 1985; Tan et 
al., 1998). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1. Gluconic acid fermentation 
Figure 1 showed the time course of gluconic acid fermentation by the culture of A. niger. 
The fermentation was carried out with an initial pH at 7. After 4.5 hours of fermentation the 
pH of the culture decreased to 5.5 due to the production of gluconic acid and the fermentation 
was switched to the pH-stat process by automatically pulsed addition of Ca(OH)2 suspension. 
The mycelia exhibited pellet-form morphology throughout the pH-stat fermentation process. 
The fermentation completed in 32 hours. The final concentrations of gluconic acid and 
biomass were 153 g/L and 4.35 g/L, respectively. The yield of gluconic acid from glucose was 
102%. 
 
3.2. L-Lactic acid fermentation 
Figure 2 showed the time course of lactic acid fermentation by culture of R. oryzae. The 
initial pH was 7. After 6 hours of fermentation, the pH of the culture dropped to 5 due to the 
production of lactic acid. The culture was then controlled at pH 5 by automatically adding 
CaCO3 slurry. The fermentation completed in 28 hours. The final concentration of lactic acid 
and biomass was 95 g/L and 4.40 g/L, respectively. The yield of lactic acid from glucose was 
79%. 
 
3.3. Fructosyltransferase fermentation 
Figure 3 showed the time course of fructosyltransferase fermentation by A. japonicus and 
the variation in carbohydrate composition during the fermentation. In the first 8 hours of 
fermentation, most sucrose was converted into FOS. As the fermentation progressed, the FOS 
was subjected to hydrolysis and was depleted at hour 26. Either the formation or the 
hydrolysis of FOS is catalyzed by fructosyltransferase, which was present in the mycelia 
(Duan et al., 1993). Hydrolysis of FOS took place when large amount of fructosyltransferase 
and only negligible sucrose were present, where FOS served as substrates for the enzyme 
reaction. The final hydrolytic products of FOS were glucose and fructose. However, glucose
