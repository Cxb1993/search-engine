Introduction
Exchange bias refers to the field-shift of a magnetic hysteresis loop when a ferromagnet (FM)/
antiferromagnet (AF) bilayer film is field-cooled below the Nèel temperature (TN) [1,2]. This
phenomenon is interesting from a technological perspective because it provides a route to
manipulate magnetic properties down to nanometer length-scales. However, attempts to produce a
universal model to quantitatively predict the strength of the exchange bias field have been
challenging because the effect emerges in both itinerant (metallic) and non-itinerant(oxides,
fluorides) magnetic thin films with a range of crystalline orientations [3,4], grain sizes [5,6],
thicknesses [7] and interfacial roughness’ [8,9]. The choice of diferent substrates for film
deposition provides one technique to control some of these parameters, particularly the crystalline
orientation of the resulting film [3,4]. A second technique to modify the properties of thin film
systems is ion-beam bombardment [10-12] which can directly alter the microstructure [12] by
grain size modification, introduction of oxygen [13], creation of site-defects [7], and modifying the
interface roughness and changing the crystalline texture [14][15]. However, the optimum
bombardment conditions, energies and bombardment times vary for different thin film materials,
and for this reason are the subject of intensive research [10,11]. In this work, we report the effect
of ion-beam bombardment on the room and low temperature magnetic properties of
CoFe/(Co,Fe)O bilayer thin films. Previously, we studied the changes in the exchange bias fields
for similar compounds with different oxygen stoichiometry [1]. Here, we extend this study to a
different oxygen concentration and investigate how the choice of substrate and ion-beam
bombardment conditions modified the magnetic properties of these thin films.
Experimental Methods
A dual ion-beam deposition technique [10] was used to prepare the ferromagnetic CoFe (6
nm)/antiferromagnetic (Co,Fe)O (18 nm) bilayers on amorphous SiO2, MgO(100) and MgO (110)
substrates. The SiO2 substrate was a Si(001) substrate pre-annealed to produce a thick SiO2 (~95
nm) amorphous surface layer. The MgO substrates were purchased from Opetech Materials. The
Kaufman ion source (800 V, 7.5 mA, Ar flow rate: 3 sccm) was used to focus an argon ion-beam
onto a commercial Co90Fe10 (at%) target surface while the End-Hall ion source (100 V, 0.4 A)
was used to in situ bombard the film during deposition with a mixture of Ar and oxygen gas flow
at a fixed ratio (21% O2/Ar). No external magnetic field was applied to the films during deposition.
The surface of the underlying (Co,Fe)O layers were bombarded with a pure Ar ion-beam (VEH=
130 V, Ar flow rate: 2.3 sccm) for five minutes to modify the interfacial microstructure, and
then capped with the top CoFe layer. A JEOL (JEM-2010) transmission electron microscope (TEM)
operating at 200 kV was used for microstructural analysis. Magnetic measurements were
performed in a commercial VSM (ADE-DMS) or SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design,
MPMS) where the thin film was in-plane field cooled (FC) in 12 kOe from 300 K down to 50 K (5
K for MPMS). In these measurements, the exchange bias field, Hex, was defined as the shift in the
hysteresis loop along the field axis with respect to zero field using the well-known equation, Hex =
(Hc1+Hc2)/2, where Hc1 and Hc2 are the zero-crossing points (coercive fields) on the left and
right hand side of the magnetic hysteresis, respectively.
Results and Discussion
A high resolution cross-sectional TEM image of the CoFe/(Co,Fe)O bilayer deposited on an
amorphous SiO2 substrate is shown in Figure 1(a). A well-separated bilayer structure is evident
with a relatively smooth interface (roughness < 2 nm) between the top CoFe layer and the bottom
(Co,Fe)O layer. The contrast variation within the two layers indicates a varying degree of strain
within the thin film. The electron diffraction patterns for the as-prepared CoFe/(Co,Fe)O bilayer is
shown in Figure 1(b). The presence of broad diffraction rings suggests a polycrystalline grain
structure consisting of small randomly orientated grains. The d-spacing of the diffraction rings in

For the CoFe/(Co,Fe)O/MgO(100) bilayers, the magnitude of exchange bias was slightly
decreased due to bombardment whereas for the CoFe/(Co,Fe)O/MgO(110) bilayers, the magnitude
of the exchange bias field at 50 K was dramatically lowered after ion-beam bombardment. The
sign of exchange bias remained negative in all cases. Our results imply a sensitive interplay
between the exchange bias strength, choice of single crystalline substrates and ion-beam
bombardment. The film grown on MgO(110) appears to be the most amenable to ion-beam
modification at the oxygen stoichiometry studied here.

To better understand the effect of the exchange coupling of the ferromagnetic CoFe metal to the
two different oxides (Co,Fe)O or (Co,Fe)3O4, we investigated the effect of annealing on the
anomalously shaped hysteresis loop found for the CoFe/(Co,Fe)O/SiO2 films. Figure 5 (a) and
(b) compare the hysteresis loops (field cooled at 20 kOe from 300 K to 5 K) for a CoFe
(8nm)/(Co,Fe)O (10 nm) bilayer with and without post-annealing of the bottom (Co,Fe)O layer at
700 K. A shifted asymmetric double-step hysteresis is seen for the as-prepared sample but after
annealing the loop becomes symmetric, and exchange bias vanishes. From the diffraction patterns
in Figures 1(b) and 1(c), we note that two distinct nanocrystalline phases, (Co,Fe)O and
(Co,Fe)3O4 , coexist in the as-prepared state, and annealing the bottom nanocomposite oxide layer
results in a transition to a single-phase layer of the spinel (Co,Fe)3O4 . The coexistence of two
different antiferromagnet oxide phases in the as-prepared state is thought to explain the asymmetric
double-step reversal seen since a mixture of phases could lead to unequal exchange coupling of the
ferromagnetic (Co,Fe) metal to the two different antiferromagnetic oxides. The rock-salt to spinel
transition resulted in a symmetric hysteresis loop with zero exchange bias at 5 K and a lower
coercivity. This result may also explain the origin of the double-hysteresis loops observed
elsewhere [1] and implies that the lower magnetocrystalline anisotropy present in the
antiferromagnetic spinel (Co,Fe)3O4 (KCo3O4~9 104 J/m3 [20]) compared with the rock -salt
antiferromagnet (KCoO~ 2.7 107 J/m3 [19]) ) may prevent the formation of irreversible
moments within the antiferromagnet that are a prerequisite for exchange bias [17,18].

Conclusion
This study shows that the exchange bias strength is strongly influenced by the different types of
substrate and the ion-beam modification procedure that is used. It also highlights the importance of
selecting appropriate ion-beam conditions specific to the substrate to achieve the desired magnetic
properties. In addition, the exchange bias magnitude was generally reduced upon ion-beam
bombardment, suggesting that the role of the ion-beam bombardment is to introduce defects,
interface roughness [21] or spin misalignments at the (Co,Fe)O surface and thus reduce Hex in
these bilayers. We find that the most likely source of the double-stepped hysteresis loops that we
observe is the occurrence of mixed phases within the oxide. We note that this magnetic feature
does not appear for the films deposited on the MgO substrates but is restricted to those deposited
on SiO2. Post-annealing of (Co,Fe)O thin films results in a sudden drop in both Hc and Hex, and
this is ascribed to the formation of spinel ferrimagnetic (Co,Fe)3O4. Future work is in progress to
better understand the crystalline phases, microstructure and interface roughness of the thin films
prepared on the MgO substrates, and also to better investigate the angular-dependence of the
magnetic coercitivity and exchange bias field with and without bombardment.
