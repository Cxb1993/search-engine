Abstract 
 
Independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely used to alleviate interference caused by 
noise components from the electromagnetic recordings of brain activity. Each independent 
component includes a temporal waveform and its scalp topography. The temporal waveforms 
decomposed from electromagnatic signals by ICA are independent. The scalp distribution is the 
strength of the temporal waveform on each sensor location. In other words, an independent 
component may be constituted by multiple sources in different brain areas with the same source 
activity. Thus the independent component can provide the information for estimating brain network. 
In this project, we proposed to develop a method to estimate the cortical mapping of an independent 
component, which is then used to statistically guide the selection of cortical brain areas with highly 
similar temporal activity and the estimation of brain functional network. Until now, we have 
developed an algorithm to calculate the cortical source distribution of an independent component. 
Moreover, we have evaluated the accuracy of the proposed method by using simulation studies. In 
the second half year, we will focus on developing the algorithm of functional  neural network 
estimation. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, it will be applied to the 
magnetoencephalography data acquired in the gender experiment.

parameters. Furthermore, using the proposed cortical mapping approach to estimate the cortical 
activation topography is more flexible because different kinds of ICA methods can be engaged to 
disentangle MEG/EEG signals according to their characteristics (Kachenoura et al., 2008). 
 
Related Works 
 
The source information of an IC can be calculated by estimating the associated brain activity from 
the scalp topography of the IC. Dipole fitting (Scherg and Von Cramon, 1985) is a widely used 
method for source localization (Cao et al., 2002; Debener et al., 2005a; Debener et al., 2005b; 
Makeig et al., 2004a; Makeig et al., 2004b; Onton et al., 2005; Sercheli et al., 2009). However, this 
method requires a fixed number of dipoles and initial guesses of dipole parameters to be made in 
advance (Michel et al., 2004). The simple assumption that there is only one dipole source associated 
with every IC (Cao et al., 2002; Latif et al., 2007; Zhukov et al., 2000) is generally not true, 
particularly when an IC is associated with synchronized activity among multiple regions of the brain 
(Tang et al., 2005). Furthermore, it has been reported that estimation results are heavily influenced by 
the initial guesses regarding the parameters in the dipole source model (Cuffin, 1998; Grech et al., 
2008). 
 
EMSICA (Tsai et al., 2006) is another way to calculate the source information for each IC. The 
conventional ICA method is modified to simultaneously estimate the independent temporal dynamics 
and their corresponding cortical activation topographies. This method utilizes the Bayesian statistical 
framework for imaging independent brain activity using implicit and explicit constraints. Compared 
to the temporal ICs obtained by the conventional ICA method, EMSICA estimates the spatiotemporal 
ICs at the expense of other unknown parameters, and thus may increase the risk of instability in the 
estimation of the unmixing matrix. 
 
Method 
 
The estimation method consists of a forward model, which represents the relationship between 
sources of brain activity and MEG measurements, a general linear model, which relates the cortical 
activation topography to the scalp topography, and the minimum norm solution to this linear model. 
 
Forward model 
In the MEG forward model, the lead field vector  indicates how the unit dipole with 
parameters θ = {r, q} contributes to the measurements of the MEG sensor array:   
  (1) 
where  is the gain matrix describing the sensitivity of C MEG sensors to the current 
dipole source located at , and  is a unit vector representing the dipole orientation 
(Baillet et al., 2001; Mosher et al., 1999; Sekihara and Nagarajan, 2008).  
 
MEG measurements are induced by an ensemble of neuronal activity throughout the entire brain, 
which can be represented by a distributed source model. Assume that there are P vertices on the 
6 
measurements  contributed by the noise components   (Tsai et al., 2006). 
 
Let vector  represent the cortical activation topography of the k-th 
signal component, , . The dipole activity  and the signal component 
 can be related by (Tsai et al., 2006):  
  (5) 
By substituting Eq. (5) into the forward model, Eq. (4) becomes  
  (6) 
where . According to Eqs. (4) and (6), the relationship between cortical 
activation topographic matrix B and scalp topographic matrix As of signal components  can be 
expressed as the linear equation  
  (7) 
 
When the data acquisition period is long enough, we can assume that the set of signals  at 
every time point span the space of . Eq. (7) can thus be expressed as   
  
  (8) 
or 
  (9) 
 
To obtain a unique and stable solution, the Tikhonov regularization term (Tikhonov, 1977) is added 
to the linear model in Eq. (9) to impose the minimum norm constraint on cortical activation 
topography . This regularization term can avoid the overfitting problem and provide a solution to 
the estimation of cortical activation topography  according to the design of the Tikhonov matrix 
T, which is expressed as 
  (10) 
where  is the noise covariance matrix and λ is a hyperparameter for balancing the different scales 
between the fitting residual  and the regularization term . In the present 
study, we make no prior assumptions in the estimation of cortical activity, and thus the identity 
matrix, I, is adopted as the Tikhonov matrix (Hämäläinen and Ilmoniemi, 1994; Hauk, 2004). Finally, 
the cortical activation topography  can be calculated by  
  (11) 
According to the matrix inversion lemma, we can derive another form of the solution:  
  (12) 
Eq. (12) is preferable for estimating  because the dimension of , , is usually much 
smaller than that of , which is .

To simulate the background activity of the brain, 3,000 additional dipoles were randomly deployed 
within a sphere with a radius of 7 cm centered in the middle of the brain. The amplitude of each 
random dipole was drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.1 
nAm. The spherical model was adopted as the head model in the calculation of the gain matrix. Ten 
concatenated trials, each with 1000-ms data, were generated in this study.  
 
In each simulation study, we first performed FastICA (Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000) to alleviate 
interference in the simulated MEG data by removing noise components and then mixing the 
remaining components. Next, the de-noised measurements were again decomposed into ICs using 
FastICA. The proposed method was then performed to estimate the cortical activation topographies 
of these newly obtained ICs. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
In each simulation, the de-noised measurements were decomposed into two ICs: IC1 and IC2. Figs. 
2 and 3 illustrates the temporal waveforms and scalp topographies of the ICs as well as the 
corresponding cortical activation topographies. To evaluate the goodness of data fit in our simulation 
results, the scalp topography of the k-th IC, , was compared with its scalp projection  
of the estimated cortical activation topography , k = 1 and 2, using the absolute correlation 
coefficient (ACC), . In these two studies,  and , k = 1 and 2, had 
the maximum activations located at the same channel and their ACCs were all higher than 0.98, 
indicating that the estimated cortical activation topographies had scalp projections highly similar to 
the scalp topographies of the associated ICs.

Fig. 2: Results of simulation study 1. The temporal waveforms and scalp topographies of IC1 and IC2 
decomposed from the first simulation data set as well as their corresponding cortical activation topographies 
are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. The ACC between the scalp topography of the k-th IC, , and the 
scalp projection of the estimated cortical activation topography, , is shown in the bracket as well as the 
ACC between the temporal waveform of IC and its corresponding source activity.

The framework of the proposed method for estimating cortical activation topography is based on 
the l2-norm with only one constraint, that is, the minimum norm constraint on the cortical activation 
topography. However, the framework can be extended to a general form based on the lp-norm. When 
p is large, the estimated cortical activation topographies tend to be smooth. On the other hand, the 
l1-norm is suitable for locating focal sources (Uutela et al., 1999). When prior information or 
assumptions about sources (for example, statistical maps estimated from fMRI data) are incorporated, 
additional constraints can be included in this framework to improve estimation accuracy. Moreover, 
the spatial Laplacian operator can be imposed to obtain smooth cortical activation topographies 
(Pascualmarqui et al., 1994). Instead of the identity matrix used in this study, a weighting matrix can 
be used as the Tikhonov matrix in Eq. (10) (Michel et al., 2004) to alleviate the tendency of 
superficial sources caused by the minimum norm constraint. For example, one can use a 
depth-related weighting matrix based on the norms of lead field vectors (Fuchs et al., 1999). 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that solving the linear model with multiple constraints or based on 
lp-norm with p 2 is more difficult than solving the linear model proposed in this study. 
 
The proposed cortical activation topography estimation method can also be used to calculate the 
tomographic activity distribution throughout the entire brain volume, including the subcortical areas. 
However, the large number of free variables would cause instability in estimation as well as high cost 
of memory space and computational time. Therefore, this study calculated the cortical activation 
topography of source distributions only on the cortical surface. 
 
In addition to FastICA, the proposed method can also use other kinds of temporal ICA algorithms 
to decompose electromagnetic recordings, such as COM2 (Comon, 1994), ICAR (Albera et al., 2005), 
infomax (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995; Lee et al., 1999), JADE (Cardoso and Souloumiac, 1993), 
RobustICA (Zarzoso and Comon, 2010), and SOBI (Belouchrani et al., 1997). In this study, FastICA 
was used to decompose the measurements because of its high computational efficiency. However, the 
characteristics of brain activity may influence the performance of ICA (Delorme and Makeig, 2004; 
Kachenoura et al., 2008; Makeig et al., 2004a) and our method provides the flexibility to choose the 
most appropriate ICA algorithm.
