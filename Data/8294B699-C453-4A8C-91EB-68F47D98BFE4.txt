electrolyte fuel cells.  The hydrophobic property 
of PtRu/dodecylamine- carbon was expected to 
supply the reactant gases and expel the produced 
water from the gas network [14].  
 
2. Experiment 
 
2-1. Surface modification of Carbon (Vulcan 
XC-72) 
 
In order to clean the carbon surface, the raw 
carbon [Carbon(raw)] was pretreated in 
concentrated HCl (37% Scharlau) at 700C for 12hr 
[(Carbon(HCl)). 
The raw carbon [Carbon(raw)] was modified 
by organic synthetic method based on the formation 
of an amide bond [15].  Purified carbon were 
stirred in concentrated HNO3 (65% Scharlau) at to 
form carboxyl group.  Then the carboxyl- 
functionalized carbon was chlorinated by refluxing 
in SOCl2.  After removal of the residual SOCl2 
(Aldrich 98%) by distillation, the acyl 
chloride-functionalized carbon were reacted with 
excess dodecylamine (ACROS) in dehydrated 
toluene to obtain the desired C(HN(CH2)11CH3). 
 
2-2. Electrocatalyst preparation 
 
In order to prepare well-dispersed platinum 
colloids on the modified-carbons, impregnation 
method was applied with methanol reduction [16].  
H2PtCl6 (ACROS), RuCl3 (Strem) and carbon 
supports were mixed in distilled water for 3hr.  
The molar ratio of Pt and Ru was 1:1.  
Subsequently, methanol was then added into the 
Pt-Ru solution for reduction.  Afterward it was 
cooled, filtered, and then washed by distilled water 
several times. After drying, three kinds of 
electrocatalysts was obtained: PtRu/C (raw), 
PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) and PtRu/C(HCl). 
 
2-3. Preparation of 3E-MEAs 
 
The standard catalytic ink was obtained by 
mixing Pt-Ru/C(raw) catalyst, Nafion solution (5%, 
Aldrich) and D.I. water at a carbon/Nafion (dry) 
ratio of 7:3 and a Nafion solution/water ratio of 1:1.  
Different ratio of PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) and 
PtRu/C(HCl) catalysts were employed in  the 
alternative catalytic ink.  The ratio of carbon : 
Nafion : solvent was the same with the standard 
catalytic ink.  The process of the catalytic ink is 
represented in Fig 1. 
The standard electrode (SE-0) was prepared by 
brushing the standard catalytic ink onto a 
wet-proofed carbon paper (Toray TGPH060).  The 
preparing procedure for the alternative electrode 
(AE-1), (AE-2), (AE-3), (AE-4) and (AE-5) 
followed that for standard electrode by using 
alternative catalytic ink with 20%, 30%, 40%, 80%, 
100% of PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) in PtRu/C(HCl) 
catalyst mixture.  All electrodes were prepared 
with a Pt loading of 0.8 mg/cm2.  The exposure 
area of the electrodes was 2.5 x 2.5 cm2.

Catalytic ink 
 
A platinum coating of 1.0 x 2.5 cm2 was 
deposited on a Nafion 117 membrane (Dupont) as a 
pseudo-reference electrode [17].  A three electrode 
membrane electrode assembly (3E-MEA) was made 
by hot pressing two prepared electrodes on the 
reference-deposited membrane at 1350C under 30 
kg/cm2 for 1.5min. 
 
2-4. Electrochemical characterizations 
 
The 3E-MEA was installed as a single cell. 
The reaction gases (hydrogen/oxygen) were fed to 
the cell at a flow rate of 100 ml/min.  The cell 
temperature was held at 700C throughout the 
experiment.  The gases for anode and cathode 
were held at 950C and 600C, respectively. 
The polarization curves of the cell at steady 
state were collected using an electronic load (model 
63010 from Chroma), and the anode and cathode 
polarization curves were measured against a 
pseudo-reference electrode using a multimeter 
(model 803 from Prova) at the same time.

linear decrease was mainly due to the resistance of 
electrolyte between cathode and reference 
electrode.  The behavior of cell polarization curve 
is similar to the cathode, because the anode

overpotential) for fuel cell system.  The Tafel 
slope is 30.5 mV/decade for 20% PtRu/ 
C(HN(CH2)11CH3), lower than 38.2 mV/decade for 
0% PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3).  This enhanced 
activity of PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) was believed 
due to the increased surface area created by high 
dispersion.  Fig. 8 illustrates the effect of PtRu/C 
(HN(CH2)11CH3) content in catalytic layer on Tafel 
slope and ohmic resistance.  The PtRu/C 
(HN(CH2)11CH3) content in the range of 20-40% 
gave a maximum activity.  The ohmic resistance 
gradually increased with the increase of the 
PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) content.  From those 
results dodecylamine group is expected to have 
higher ohmic resistance on electron transfer. 
 
3-3. Effect of the PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) content 
in the catalytic layer on the polarization 
curves. 
 
The polarization curve with the PtRu/C 
(HN(CH2)11CH3) content from 0 to 100 wt% in the 
cathode catalytic layer and PtRu/C(HCl) in the 
anode catalytic layer are shown in Fig. 6.  In the 
cathode side, the best performance was obtained 
with the catalytic layer containing PtRu/C 
(HN(CH2)11CH3) between 20 and 40 wt%.  When 
the content of PtRu/C(HN(CH2)11CH3) in the 
catalytic layer was 80%, the potential decreased 
sharply at current density higher than 30 mA/cm2.  
Possibly, it was due to that dodecylamine on the 
carbon surface had higher ohmic resistance.  The 
phenomenon was also revealed in the polarization 
curve data of 0 wt% (AE-0).  AE-0 electrode 
shows a rapid decrease at low current density and 
has a higher performance at low current density.    
That means the carbon has lower ohmic resistance 
after cleaned with HCl.  However, the 
dodecylamine-modified carbon shows higher 
ohmic resistance.  The result was concluded in 
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.  Fig. 7 shows the cathode 
performance on the Tafel plots of the cathode for 
AE-0 and AE-1 electrodes.  Lower Tafel slope 
means higher activity (charge-transfer

polarization curves. 
 
Fig. 9 shows the cathode and anode 
polarization curves for cathode with AE-0, AE-3, 
E-TEK, SE-0 and anode with AE-0.  The 
electrode (AE-3) made by mixing PtRu/C 
(HN(CH2)11CH3) with PtRu/C(HCl) shows nearly 
37.5% and 44.7% increase in cathode current 
density at 0.6V compared to AE-0 (without PtRu/C 
(HN(CH2)11CH3)) electrode and  E-TEK electrode.  
The performance of this type of electrode was also 
better than that of the commercial electrcatalysts 
(E-TEK, 20wt% PtRu/Vulcan XC-72) or standard 
electrode (SE-0) whole the current density.  The 
enhanced performance of AE-3 electrode is
