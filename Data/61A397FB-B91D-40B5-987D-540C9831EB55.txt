Chen and Mei (1974), and Tsay and Liu (1983), etc. 
Nevertheless, in all earlier researches, the boundary condition 
applied on the surfaces of porous structures is still the strict 
slipping condition, which induces an unreasonable inference 
that the wave will always permeate through the porous wall in 
normal direction regardless what the incident angle is. By this 
inference, even though the wave field seems reasonable in most 
of the physical domain in the harbor, the paradoxical 
phenomenon that the wave permeates through the porous wall 
completely must appear when the incoming wave is parallel to 
the porous wall. 
For the purpose of eliminating the above paradoxical 
phenomenon, a new partial-slipping boundary condition on the 
thin porous wall is derived from the concept similar to that in 
Beavers and Joseph (1967). Moreover, in order to apply this 
boundary condition when analyzing of wave field in the harbor 
with porous walls inside, the analytical solution of oblique 
waves impacting on a thin porous wall with a vertical 
impermeable bank behind is thus obtained in the present study. 
A simplified reflection coefficient and the boundary 
condition applicable for porous breakwaters inside the harbor 
are further found. And the boundary element method (BEM) is 
adopted to analyze the wave field of the harbor in which porous 
breakwaters are arranged alongside the inner walls.  
By applying our partial-slipping boundary condition 
including undetermined incident angles, the iteration method is 
used in the BEM model to find out the most appropriate 
incident angle for each boundary element, and the wave field of 
the harbor with porous breakwaters inside is well investigated 
and proven more reasonable than the earlier investigations. 
 
2. OBLIQUE WAVE ANALYSIS OF THIN POROUS 
WALL WITH AN IMPERMEABLE BANK BEHIND 
 
2.1 Governing Equations 
The physical domain including 3 flow regions is shown in 
Figure 1. 
The fluid is divided into regions (1) and (2) by a thin porous 
wall (region (3)) while the water wave propagates from the 
unbounded far field of region (1), acting on the porous wall 
with an impermeable vertical bank behind it. For a linear water 
wave problem investigated in the present study, the fluid is 
assumed to be inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational. 
For region (1) and region (2), we have 
,2,1, =Φ∇= jV jj                       (1) 
where jV  and jΦ  are velocity vectors and velocity 
potentials of fluid, respectively; and the subscript j  denotes 
the flow regions (see Figure 1). And the continuity equation 
and linear momentum equation are

when it is on the surface of seepage, where jp  is the pressure 
of the fluid and ρ  is the density of the fluid. 
For region (3) that is within the porous wall, we have 
,33 Φ∇=V                                     (6) 
where 3V  and 3Φ  are velocity vector and velocity potential 
of fluid inside the porous wall, respectively (see Figure 1). And, 
referring to Huang (1991), the continuity equation and linear 
momentum equation are

3. NUMERICAL APPROACH FOR HARBOR 
ANALYSIS – BOUNDARY ELEMENT METHOD 
 
In the present study, the partial-slipping boundary condition 
is applied on the surfaces of porous walls inside the harbor, 
investigating the wave field and physical properties by using 
proper numerical approaches for simulation. 
From (39), the simplified reflection coefficient of the thin 
porous wall and a vertical bank impacted by oblique waves is 
found. Moreover, the boundary condition applicable for 
surfaces of porous walls inside the harbor is thus obtained from 
(41) and (42). 
 
3.1 Governing Equations 
The schematic diagram of a harbor with porous walls inside 
is shown in Figure 3. The x and y axes lie on the plane of the 
still water level with the origin at the middle point of the harbor 
entrance. And the physical domain is divided into two regions 
with constant water depth, where the far region 1 is a 
semi-unbounded region with constant water depth, and the near 
region 2 is the harbor region.  
Under the assumption that the homogeneous fluid is inviscid, 
incompressible, and the flow motion is irrotational, there exists 
a velocity potential ( )tzyx ,,,Φ  which satisfies the 
following Laplace equation 
1,2,j,02 ==Φ∇ 　　　　　j                    (43) 
where 1Φ  and 2Φ  are velocity potential of the region 1 and 
region 2, respectively. 
The velocity potential ( )tzyx ,,,1Φ  in region 1 can be 
expressed as

where h  is the water depth, g  is the gravitational

wave potential function. 
By substituting (44) into (43), it can be obtained that

Assume that the velocity potential 1f  in region 1 can be 
expressed as a linear combination of incident and scattered 
wave potentials (i.e. 
si fff +=1 ). By substituting 1f  into 
(45), the governing equation for the scattering wave potential 
sf  in semi-unbounded region 1 can be obtained as

applying our partial-slipping boundary condition including 
undetermined incident angles, the iteration method is used in 
the present BEM model to find out the most appropriate 
incident angle for each boundary element, and thus investigate 
the more reasonable harbor wave field. 
Figure 6 represents R  and θ  versus L  divided by the 
wave length λ  at the middle of the backwall of the 
rectangular harbor, on which the normal and oblique incoming 
waves impact. The case of the harbor without porous walls 
inside is indicated by the dashed curve, the case of the 
completely slipping condition applied on each boundary 
element is shown as the dash-dotted curve, and the case 
applying our proposed partial-slipping boundary condition is 
illustrated by the solid curve. It is clearly observed that the 
porous walls inside the harbor significantly reduce the 
amplification factor at the peak of the resonance, and the 
incident angle varies gradually with the increase of λL . 
Furthermore, it can be seen that as 2λ=L , a little 
perturbation occurs in the wave field with porous walls inside 
the harbor, inducing a discontinuity on the curve of the incident 
angle. However, it seems from the figure that the effect of the 
partial-slipping boundary condition is indistinct on the 
backwall of the harbor. In addition, due to the long and narrow 
shape of the harbor in which incident and reflective waves 
repeatedly act and come to a consistent state eventually, it can 
be obtained that regardless of the incoming wave direction, the 
wave still shows similar trends on the backwall of the harbor, 
as shown in Figure 6 (a) and (b). 
Figure 7 indicates R  and θ  at the middle of the sidewall 
of the rectangular harbor for different incoming wave 
directions. With similar trend of Figure 6, a little perturbation 
reveals on the curve of the amplification factor for 2λ=L , 
and the curve of the incident angle has a discontinuity at the 
same point. And a little different from the wave field of the 
backwall, some visible variations of amplification factors 
indeed appear between the cases of the conventional slipping 
condition and our partial-slipping condition for smaller λL  
values.  
From Figure 6 and Figure 7, it can be confirmed that the 
slight perturbation appearing at 2λ=L  indeed alters the 
pattern of the smoothly-varied θ  curve. And it may well be 
concluded that the variable incident angles corresponding to 
different boundary points and wave conditions are reasonably 
in more agreement with the real wave field with porous walls in 
the harbor. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
By adopting the partial-slipping boundary condition derived 
from the concept similar to that in Beavers and Joseph (1967), 
the analytical solution of oblique impact water waves on a thin 
porous wall with a vertical bank behind is obtained in the 
present study.  
Furthermore, according to the result of this designed problem, 
the present study finds out the simplified reflection coefficient 
and boundary condition applicable on the surfaces of porous 
walls arranged along the inner side of the harbor.  
The boundary element method (BEM) is designated for the 
analysis of wave fields in the harbor with porous walls inside. 
And by applying our partial-slipping boundary condition with 
iterative manipulations operated on the present model, the most 
appropriate incident angle for each boundary element is found, 
and the harbor wave field in reasonable agreement with 
physical expectation is well investigated. 
It can be concluded that the slight perturbation appearing at 
2λ=L  may alters the pattern of the incident angle curve. 
And the variable incident angles corresponding to different 
boundary points and wave conditions indeed agree with the real 
wave field with porous walls in the harbor. The result is also 
expected to be the theoretical basis for optimization of harbor 
oscillation and elimination of wave energy.
