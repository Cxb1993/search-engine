the resulting ST-OFDM and SF-OFDM systems
have a much better performance than the con-
ventional OFDM system.
In this report, we will study linearly pre-
coded ST-OFDM and SF-OFDM systems. Lin-
ear precoding technique has been applied to
SISO OFDM system and it was demonstrated
that by carefully designing the precoding ma-
trix, the performance of OFDM system can be
substantially improved [5] [6] [7]. In particular,
the class of precoding matrices known as APU
matrices was shown to be able to average the
noise power over both time and frequency do-
mains [7]. APU precoded OFDM systems were
shown to be robust to both time and frequency
selective channels. In this report, we will apply
the APU precoding matrices to both ST-OFDM
and SF-OFDM systems. The complexity of APU
matrices is low, only addition is needed in the
implementation. Moreover the precoding matrix
does not depend on the channel and hence chan-
nel knowledge is not needed at the transmitter.
We will analyze the performance of these pre-
coded systems and demonstrate that substantial
gain of several dBs can be obtained.

Fig. 1 shows the block diagram for a linearly pre-
coded MIMO OFDM system. For simplicity, we
focus our discussion on the 2-Tx 1-Rx antenna
case and the Alamouti code is employed [2]. We
will derive the results for ST-OFDM systems.
The results can easily be extended to SF-OFDM
system, the more general case of m-Tx n-Rx an-
tennas or other orthogonal codes. At block index
n, the transmitted vector containing QAM sym-
bols is Si(n) = [si(Nn) si(Nn‚àí 1) . . . Si(Nn‚àí
N + 1)]T , for i = 1, 2. We assume that the pre-
coding matrix T(z) is N by N and it is an APU
matrix of order P . Hence we have
Xi(n) =
P‚àë
k=0
TkSi(n‚àí k).
The transmission belongs to the class of over-
lapped block transmission as Xi(n) contains
(P + 1) information vectors Si(n ‚àí k). Let Ts
be the time taken for the transmission of one
OFDM block. At the output of the Alamouti
encoding, we get
Y1(t, n) = X1(n), Y1(t+ Ts, n) = ‚àíX‚àó2(n),
Y2(t, n) = X2(n), Y2(t+ Ts, n) = X1(n).
IFFT operations are applied to the vectors Yi.
Cyclic prefix (CP) is added before the IFFT out-
puts are transmitted. We assume that the CP
length is long enough and the transmission chan-
nels are invariant for a period of 2T so that there
is no interference. The channel impulse response

‚àí1(n+ k)ŒΩi(n+ k).
Define the vector Œ≤i(n) = D‚àí1(n)ŒΩi(n). Then
œÅi(n) is simply the output of TÀú(z) when the in-
put is Œ≤i(n). It is easy to see that the autocor-
relation matrices of Œ≤i(n) satisfy the condition
given in (??). Since the inverse of an APU ma-
trix is also APU, we can prove that the noise
variance of the lth component of SÃÇi(n) is
œÉ2l,i(n) =

|H1(j, n+ k)|2 + |H2(j, n+ k)|2 , (1)
which is independent on both l and i. All the
components have the same noise variance. It has
an averaging effect over both the frequency index
j and the block index k.
Comparison With the Conventional ST-
OFDM System: In the conventional ST-
OFDM system, there is no linear precoder. The
corresponding results can be obtained by setting
T(z) = I. It can be verified that in this case, the
noise variance of lth component of SÃÇi(n) is
œÉ2l,i(n) =
N0
|H1(l, n)|2 + |H2(l, n)|2 .
When both the channels encounter deep fading
at the same frequency bin, say l0, then the SNR
for the l0th component will be low and the per-
formance of the ST-OFDM system will be lim-
ited by these bad frequency bins. On the other
hand, for linearly precoded ST-OFDM system,
the receiver outputs at all the frequency bins
have the same noise variance and it is given by
(1). Note that since TÀú(z) is APU, the total
noise variances of the precoded ST-OFDM sys-
tem and the conventional ST-OFDM system are
the same. The APU decoding matrix simply re-
distributes the noise power so that all frequency
bins have the same noise power.
Cases When Both Channels Have the
Same Spectral Nulls: When both channels
have the same spectral null, say at frequency
bin l0, then from (1) we see that the variance
of all the noise components will becomes very
large. To solve this noise amplification problem,
we need an MMSE decoding matrix.
MMSE decoding matrix: In the derivation
below, we assume that the transmitted QAM
symbols are uncorrelated and have the same sig-
nal power. That is,
E{Si(n)SHj (n‚àí l)} = Œ¥(j ‚àí i)Œ¥(l)

I.
Given output of the space-time decoder Zi(n),
we want to find an MMSE decoding matrix for
the detection of Si(n). We consider only the
case of detecting S1 as the MMSE decoding ma-
trix for the case of detecting S2 is identical. We
consider an P th-order MMSE decoding matrix.
Hence the output of this system is given by2
SÃÇ1(n) =
P‚àë
k=0
Wk(n)Z1(n+ k).
Define the error vector as e(n) = SÃÇ1(n)‚àíS1(n).
Our goal is to find Wk(n) such that the mean

MMSE receiver is employed. The performance
of 2-Tx 1-Rx antenna ST-OFDM system with-
out any precoding matrix is comparable to that
of the Hadamard precoded SISO-OFDM system.
When a Hadamard precoding matrix is applied
to the ST-OFDM scheme, we can further im-
prove the BER performance. At a BER of 10‚àí3,
we can have an additional gain of about 3 and
4 dB for the zero-forcing and the MMSE case
decoding matrices respectively. Moreover if an
first order APU matrix of is used, we are able to
further improve the gain by 1 dB. Also observe
these gains increase when BER decreases.
We have also carried out Monte-Carlo exper-
iments for the SF-OFDM case. The experiment
settings are the same as those in the ST-OFDM
case. In the SF-OFDM case, the system is free
from ISI only when the channel has the same
gain for two successive frequency bins. As the
channel length is much smaller than the FFT
size, the ISI effect will be small. The BER re-
sults are shown in Fig. 3. Comparing the results
for different systems, we see the same trend as
in the ST-OFDM case. APU precoding matrices
can also substantially improve the performance
of the SF-OFDM system. Note that without any
precoding matrix, there is performance flooring
for the 2Tx1Rx OFDM system due to the ISI ef-
fect mentioned earlier. It can be shown [9] that
the precoding matrix can mitigate the ISI effect
and performance flooring occurs at a much lower
BER.
