Abstract
This research targets at designing and implementing an experimental Differentiated Service (DS)
experimental backbone network to provide high priority application flows with special DS treatments,
including Expedited Forwarding (EF) for real-time/interactive applications and Assured Forwarding (AF) for
bulk data transfer applications. The DS backbone system can be implemented on 533 MHz Intel XScale
IXP-425 network processor based target boards, empowered by SnapGear Linux, with the Netlink kernel
framework for highly flexible and advanced traffic engineering. The DS edge routers can perform packet MF
(Multi-Field) or DSCP (DS Code Point) classification, conditioning (policing/shaping/dropping) of ingress
traffic, DS marking or remarking for EF/AF/BE behavior aggregations to decide per-hop system resources
allocation (PHB), while the DS core routers perform only the corresponding PHB to achieve fast-routing. We
have successfully conducted a wide range of tests and data analyses for this system and its subsystems,
including the DS edge routers and core routers. The results show that our DS domain at the proposed topology
scale can correctly allocate the required bandwidth according to the DS mark, and greatly improve the latency
of EF under BE traffic congestion (around 7 ms), compared to that of BE under the same congestion condition
(around 80 ms), say packet size at 128 bytes, which is typical for most real-time/interactive applications.
There is about 7 ms latency growth as the packet size increases for both EF and BE packets under BE traffic
congestion, but less than 1.1 ms latency growth when no traffic congestion. The overall topology scaling
effect on the latency increase is small, only around or less than 1 ms at our proposed DS domain topology.

The DEGEB system contains two subsystems performing different functions, as depicted in Figure 1
and described below:
 DSER (DS Edge Router)
As denoted as ‘E’in Figure 1, this type of member routers are located at the edge of the DS
backbone as the gateways, by manipulating the ingress traffic to the DS backbone domain, including
ingress packet classification, traffic conditioning (policing/shaping/dropping), and packet DSCP (DS
Code Point) marking/remarking to decide an appropriate PHB (Per Hop Behavior) for a specific BA.
 DSCR (DS Core Router)
As denoted as ‘C’in Figure 1, this type of member routers are located within the DS backbone
domain, and can perform fast routing according to the corresponding PHB (Per Hop Behavior).
As mentioned above, the DSER and DSCR perform differently. The DSER subsystem can play
as the ingress or egress edge routers, where the ingress traffics from other DS or non-DS domains
can be manipulated to comply with the Service Level Agreement (SLA). In other words, ingress
traffics are classified, policed/shaped or dropped, and marked/remarked with different DS marks to
assign various PHBs such as EF-PHB, AF-PHB, or BE-PHB according to the fact that their
application requirements are latency-intensive, throughput-intensive, or don’t-care-anyway
respectively. Subsequently, these DS-marked traffics, admitted by the ingress router to enter the DS
domain, will be fast routed through the DS domain by the DS core routers with respect to their
desired DS quality, and finally the egress DS edge router will determine if dropping the DS-mark is
necessary depending on whether the next domain is DS based or not.
2.2 Hardware Platform
Each member router in both subsystems is implemented on the Intel IXP-425 network processor
platform [5], also known as IXDPG-425, as shown in Figure 2. This embedded platform has the
following major components:
 CPU: Intel XScale IXP-425 network processor @ 533 MHz
 ROM: 2 MB Flash ROM
 RAM: 32MB SDRAM
 Ethernet: 4x switched 10/100 Mbps LAN ports and 1x 10/100 WAN port
 RS-232: for system monitoring console
and other peripheral interfaces not used in this research.
2.3 Software Framework
In order to implement the embedded design of each member router, we adopted SnapGear Linux 3.3
[6] (Linux kernel 2.4.31) as the embedded OS kernel so that many nice software features are
available from the Linux OS kernel-space and user-space.
 Kernel space:
 Networking core: NET4.
 Packet filtering framework: Netfilter [7].
 Advanced traffic control framework: Netlink [8].
 T2: Subsystem Tests of the DSCR (DS Core Router Test)
 T2-001: DSCP-Reader Test
 T2-002: PHB-Handler Test
 T3: Internal Interface Test between the DSER and DSCR Subsystems
 DSCP-Marked Flow Exchange Test
 T4: System Integration Tests of the DEGEB system
 DS Backbone Integration Test
More details of the system and these test procedures can be found elsewhere [12-15]. This
report will only describe and analyze the major results of these tests.
4. Test Results and Analyses
This section describes and analyzes the major results of the subsystem-level tests (T1 and T2) and
system-level tests (T3 and T4).
4.1 The DSER Subsystem Integration Test Results and Analyses (T1)
A successfully test shell script based on Ingress/DSMARK qdiscs for T1 can be found in [15]. The
integration test results are summarized in Table 4-1, where the first two columns describe the
bandwidth policing rules according to the shaping and remarking rules, and the measured bandwidth
and packet loss rate are given in the last two columns, assuming a 100 Mbps constant bit rate of
traffic congestion generated by iperf with the desired DSCP values.
DS Class Shaped Total Bandwidth Measured Bandwidth Packet Loss Rate
EF 10 Mbps 10.2 Mbps 89%
AF11 76 Mbps 75.7 Mbps 22%
AF12 46 Mbps 45.3 Mbps 52%
AF13 21 Mbps 20.7 Mbps 78%
AF21 46 Mbps 46.5 Mbps 51%
AF22 26 Mbps 25.7 Mbps 72%
AF23 11 Mbps 10.9 Mbps 88%
AF31 16 Mbps 15.9 Mbps 83%
AF32 6 Mbps 6.01 Mbps 94%
AF33 1 Mbps 1.03 Mbps 99%
BE 30 Mbps 29.6 Mbps 68%
Table 4-1 Bandwidth Integrated Test of the DSER.
The results of measured bandwidth are well expected considering some burst flow allowance
over the bandwidth limits, and one should note that the bandwidth limits for those six classes (AF11,
AF12, AF21, AF22, AF31, AF31) allowing for further shaping are additive, with bandwidth limit
contribution from their lower–precedence classes. In addition, testing with a constant UDP bit rate at
100 Mbps make it easier to measure the packet loss rates with respect to different measured
bandwidths. The results of packet loss rate are also well expected.

4.4 The DEGEB System Integration Tests (T4)
This test adopted a DS domain topology configuration as shown in the upper half of Table 4-4. Such
a DS domain topology is used as a simple example to understand how a small-scale DS domain
performs in terms of latency and throughput. For simplicity, the longest routing path is 5 hops (Ei
+C1+C2+C3+Ee), where Ei and Ee are defined as the ingress and egress DS edge routers depending
on the direction of the service application flow. This topology contains two edge routers and three
core routers, and all the possible routing paths. The equivalent number of hops are summarized in the
lower half of Table 4-4.
As a first test, the DSCP marked flow exchange has been checked along all possible paths to
ensure that the DSER and DSCR configurations on all Ethernet ports be correct to exchange the
DSCP marked flows. The results show that all the routing paths can function normally.
Next, the bandwidth sharing situations of the DS backbone among DSCP marks are also as
expected and similar to the case of (Ei + C).
The final question to ask is whether the DS domain does help to improve the latency for
real-time/interactive applications? The answer is positive, and the results of the round-trip latency
measurements for EF and BE packets, routed through multiple hops under BE traffic congestion, are
summarized in Figure 4. From bottom up, Figure 4 illustrates the round-trip latency effects of three
test conditions:
(1) the lowest family curves for conditions that a BE or EF packet is routed through 3, 4, 5 hops
when no traffic congestion;
(2) the middle family curves for conditions that a EF packet is routed through 3, 4, 5 hops under BE
traffic congestion;
(3) the highest family curves for conditions that a BE packet is routed through 3, 4, 5 hops under BE

congestion.
5. Conclusion
We have successfully conducted a wide range of tests and data analyses for the DEGEB system and
its subsystems DSER and DSCR, through test cases T1~ T4. The DS mechanisms of both edge and
core routers are tested in T1 and T2 respectively, whereas T3 is for the internal interface test at the
system level, and T4 for the system function/performance tests.
The function issues are related to whether the DS marked flows can be treated correctly among
the DS member routers, as well as between the DS backbone and the environment. The performance
issues are more related to the correctness of the per-hop system resource allocation, including the
results of latency and bandwidth competition between DS classes. Especially, the packet size effect
on the latency measurement is also given and discussed.
Thus far, all the test results are satisfactory and can meet our design goal, both for bulk data
transfer and for small packet size real-time/interactive applications. From these test results, it is
clearly seen that our DS domain at the proposed topology scale can correctly allocate the required
bandwidth according to the DS marks, and greatly improve the latency of EF under BE traffic
congestion, compared to that of BE under the same congestion condition. The packet size effect and
the topology scaling effect are both small, compared to the above latency improvement of EF under
BE traffic congestion.
