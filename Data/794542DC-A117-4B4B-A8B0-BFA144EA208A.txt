1. Introduction
Ultrafiltration is primarily a siz-exclusion-based pressure-driven membrane
separation process, the pressure applied to the working fluid provides the driving
potential to force the solvent to flow through the membrane. Although, separation by
ultrafiltration is mainly based on relative molecular sizes, the chemistry of the solute
membrane interaction is also important. The molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of any
given membrane can vary with changing feed chemistries as well as with factors such
as molecular orientation, molecular configuration, operation conditions. etc.[1].
Ultrafiltration of macromolecular solutions has become an increasingly
important separation process. Today, the following applications have been proven to
be economically attractive and useful [2,3]: industrial effluents, oil emulsions,
wastewater, biological macromolecules, colloidal paint suspensions and medical
therapeutics. The transmembrane pressure applied is usually in the range of 69 to 690
kPa. The rapid development of this process was made possible by the advent of
anisotropic, high-flux membranes capable of distinguishing among molecular and
colloidal species in the 0.001 to 10μm size range.
The advantage of ultrafiltration as compared to other dewatering processes, such
as evaporation and freezing, is the absence of a change in phase or state of the solvent.
Evaporation requires the input of about 2326 kJ/kg of water evaporated while freezing
requires about 335 kJ/kg of water frozen, merely to effect the change of water from
liquid to vapor and liquid to solid, respectively. A less obvious advantage is the fact
that no complicated heat-transfer or heat-generating equipment is needed, only
electrical energy to drive the pump motor is required.
In cross-flow ultrafiltration the permeate flux generally declines with filtration
time due to the phenomenon of concentration polarization by the rejected particles
[4-6]. Several hydraulic approaches developed for reducing the effects of
permeation due to concentration polarization while still preserving an effective
transmembrane pressure, and thereby lead to improved permeate recoveries.
Consider a modified tubular-membrane module of radius mr  inserted
concentrically with a steel rod of radius mkr , on which a tight fitting wire spiral of
varied angle, having a diameter nearly equal to the annular spacing, is wrapped
entirely on the steel rod as a spacer, as shown in Fig. 1. Acutally, the modified module
shown in Fig. 1 is exactly the same as that employed in previous works [18], except
that the wire angle, instead of being unchanged, varies at an uniform rate along the
flow channel. In present study, we will investigate the effect of wire-angle variation,
either increasing or decreasing along the flow channel, on the reduction of
concentration– polarization resistance and transmembrane pressure.
3. Resistance-in-series model
Recently, new theoretical modeling was carried out in detail at the University of
Bath, UK [19,20]. Further, Song and Elimelech [21] developed the fundamental
theory and methodology providing a solid basis for the study of limiting flux in
ultrafiltration. Later, a mechanistic model for predicting the limiting flux in
ultrafiltration was also developed [22].
However, membrane ultrafiltration of macromolecular solutions is usually
analyzed by the following models: (1) the gel polarization model [23-29], (2) the
osmotic pressure model [30-38], and the resistance-in-series model [39-41]. In the gel
polarization model, permeate flux is reduced by the hydraulic resistance of gel layer.
In the osmotic pressure model, permeate flux reduction results from the decrease in
effective transmembrane pressure that occurs as the osmotic pressure of the retentate
increases. In resistance-in series model, permeate flux decreases due to the resistances
caused by fouling or solute adsorption and concentration polarization. Among them
proportional to the applied pressure. However, as the pressure is increased,
the flux begins to drop below that which would result from a linear
flux-pressure behavior. Eventually, a limiting flux is reached where any
further pressure increase no longer results in any increase in flux. Accordingly,
the following conditions are reached:
for 0P , 0J ; (5)
for small P , PconstJ  )( ; (6)
as P (or large enough), limJJ   (limiting flux) (7)
It is easy to show that Eqs. (5)-(7) satisfy Eq. (4), and that resistance-in-series
model is not only easy to describle the phenomenon of ultrafiltration in the membrane
module but also meets the required conditions during operation.
4. Experimental
The experimental apparatus, materials and procedure were exactly the same as
those in previous work [18], except that the spiral wires with angle varied at an
uniform rate along the flow channel were employed, as shown in Fig. 1. The
membrane medium used in the wired module was mainly a 150 kDa MWCO tubular
ceramic membrane (M2 type, Techsep, France; length L= 0.4m, i.d. 2rm= 6mm) with a
steel rod of radius, krm= 2mm (k=2/3), inserted concentrically. A tight fitting wire
spiral having the diameter nearly equal to, but still less than, the annular spacing,
(1-k)rm= 1mm, was wrapped with the wire angle varied at an uniform rate on the
entire steel rod as a spacer in the annulus.
Economically, since the best inclined angle of wire spiral was 30o for the system
of present interest [18], the following variation manners of wire angle   were
employed in present study: 30o→20o, 30o→10o, 30o→0o, 0o→30o, 10o→30o, 20o→30o.
5.1. Permeate fluxes
Many experimental results of average permeate fluxes, J , were obtained [42],
and some of them are plotted in Figs. 3-6, It is seen from these figures that the order
of magnitude for averaged permeate flux obtained in the following devices is
wire-rod module (k > 0, θ > 0) > wire-free rod module (k > 0, θ = 0) > rod-free
module (k = 0, θ = 0)         (8)
Further, among the wire-rod modules
(0o→30o) module >(30o→0o) module >(10o→30o) module >(30o→10o) module
>(20o→30o) module >(30o→20o) module >(30o→30o) module        (9)
5.2. Effect of steel rod and wire spiral on permeate flux
The validation of Eq.(8) was already done in previous works [17, 18]. It was
reported in these studies that increasing fluid velocity in the tubular-membrane
ultrafiltration module by inserting concentrically a steel rod could reduce the
concentration-polarization layer, resulting in improved performance. Further, when
the steel was wrapped entirely with a tight fitting wire spiral, having a dimeter nearly
equal to the annular spacing, the flow section was further reduced, resulting in larger
increase of flow velocity as well as permeate flux.
5.3. Effect of the variation of wire angle on permeate flux
Actually, increasing fluid velocity in the cross-flow type membrane modules has
two conflict effects on ultrafiltration. One, the decrease in resistance to permeation
due to reduction in concentration polarization, is good for ultrafiltration, while the
other, the decrease in average transmembrane pressure due to increase in frictional
pressure loss, is bad for ultrafiltration. Therefore, proper adjustment of the variation
(30o→10o) module >(20o→30o) module                             (16)
(30o→20o) module >(30o→30o) module                             (17)
This result indicates that the order of performance in wire-rod tubular
membranes with wire angle varied at an uniform rate is illustrated with
the averaged wire angles as
module with  =15o > module with  =20o > module with  =25o
> module with  =30o
(18)
5.4. Effect of the variation of wire angle on resistances
If experimental data obtained in membrane ultrafiltration is applied to Eq. (4),
then the following relation of the average experimental values is reached
     expexpexp PRR

fm 
                                       (19)
or
   expexp1 P
RR


 (20)
Therefore, from a straight line plot of  exp/1 J  versus  exp/1 P  under certain
operating conditions, iQ  and iC , the values of   (the intersection at ordinate) and
 fm RR  (the slope) may be determined experimentally [15-18]. With the use of
experimental data and Eq.(20) the intersection at ordinate,  , and the slope of this
straight line,  fm RR  , were determined [42].
Some values of   and  fm RR   determined are listed in Tables 1 and 2. It is
found from these tables that the validity of the result of Sections 5.1-5.3 is readly
confirmed because the orders of magnitude for the resistance of permeation,   and
 fm RR  , are in the opposite directions to those for permeate flux in Eqs. (8)-(18).
