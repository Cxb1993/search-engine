一、前言 
 在世界工業及科技文明高度發展之下，
目前人們所主要依賴的化石能源逐漸枯竭，
人類開始積極尋找他新能源去取代石化能源
應用，來解決未來石化能源量的需求以及石
化能源燃燒後所帶來的溫室效應問題。因為
不會污染環境、也不會有耗盡的問題，再加
上取得容易、不需生產成本、不會受到區域
的限制、而且源源不絕等等的優點，太陽能
成為眾多替代新能源中最受到大家重視的再
生能源，也使得各國的政府機構、私人企業
以及學術研究單位紛紛投注心力積極地研究
發展。目前已開發太陽能電池以使用的材料
分類，大致上可分為矽質、化合物與其他三
大種類 [1,2]，而各其共通的缺點為透光性
差、材料成本高、單片大面積化製程困難且
製程成本高、製程溫度高、製程時間長等。
其中因為可見光透光差的原因，使得目前太
陽能電池電板僅能架設在不影響採光之建築
物屋頂及空曠地區，大幅限制太陽能電池架
設的面積與發電量。因此，若能開發出可見
光穿透性佳的太陽能電池，則其可見光可穿
透的特性使得架設面積大幅提昇，因而可實
際增加太陽能電池之總發電量是具極有經濟
效益。在一些可能的組合中，以透明導電氧
化物(transparent conductive oxide, TCO)薄膜
形成透明之TCO p-n薄膜二極體之太陽能電
池[3]是最具有實踐上述具高可見光穿透性之
太陽能電池優勢的最新型太陽能電池。 
理論上TCO太陽能電池光電功率轉換效
率為6%，但目前所找到之日本研究所做出來
的雛形之TCO 太陽能電池的效率初步只能
達到約3％左右[4]。由於TCO太陽能電池的研
究尚未有大量資源投入，元件及電池的細部
設計、p-type及n-type TCO材料組合選擇，甚
至製程方法的發展都在萌芽的階段，使得目
前TCO 太陽能電池之光電功率轉換效率較
低，但也因此仍有極大的改善空間。最後，
目前p-type TCO薄膜[5-7]材料的研發遠較
n-type TCO薄膜落後，不僅文獻的探討，連
材料的選擇也不若n-type TCO薄膜多，因此
p-type TCO薄膜材料，也仍有許多可以突破
及改善的地方。 
二、研究目的 
    本研究之目的為以溶液法及濺鍍法製作
不同成份及類型之透明導電氧化物(TCO)薄
膜，並將其組合製備成TCO薄膜太陽能電
池，並且利用材料組合、元件設計及製程變
化，來探討上述條件的改變對TCO薄膜太陽
能電池特性的影響，藉以改善TCO薄膜太陽
電池的性能。第一年計畫的目標為製備不同
成份之n-type及p-type的TCO薄膜，並探討薄
膜製程條件對p及n-type的TCO薄膜光電性質
之影響。

濺鍍壓力為 6 mtorr，改變基板溫度由室溫、
100、200 至 300℃所鍍製之 AZO 薄膜之 XRD
圖譜。由圖可以發現鍍製出的 AZO 薄膜，不
論基板溫度為何，所形成的薄膜經與 JCPDS
的繞射標準圖譜比對，其薄膜皆為具 wurtzite
結構之 ZnO，同時薄膜均朝(002)的方向成
長，且繞射峰強度隨基板溫度越高而越強；
觀察不同的基板溫度下鍍製出的 AZO 薄膜
(002)繞射峰角度的變化，可以發現隨著基板
溫的上升，(002)繞射峰的角度也往高角度位
移，這是由於基板溫度越高，反應性增加與
鋁的取代效應也增加，所以造成繞射峰角度
就會往高角度位移。圖二為在不同的基板溫

AZO 薄膜的載子移動率與載子濃度也都上
升，所以電阻係數隨之下降，這是由於隨著
基板溫度的上升，AZO 薄膜的結晶性越好，
因而載子移動率與載子濃度就會上升，就會
使得 AZO 薄膜的電阻係數下降。

AZO 薄膜(002)繞射峰角度的變化，卻可以看
出濺鍍壓力對(002)繞射峰造成的偏移量甚
小，顯然濺鍍壓力對於氧空缺與離子摻雜效
應沒有太大的影響，所以(002)繞射峰的角度
較不會偏移。圖四為在不同的濺鍍壓力下鍍
製出的 AZO 薄膜的電學性質分析結果。由圖
似可看出，隨著濺鍍壓力由 3 mtorr 上升到 6 
mtorr 時，電阻係數有下降的趨勢，這是由於
濺鍍壓力上升的同時載子移動率與載子濃度
皆上升所導致；但濺鍍壓力由 6 mtorr 上升到
9 mtorr 時，電阻係數有上升的趨勢，這是由
於載子移動率與載子濃度皆下降所導致。

五、結論 
本研究可以自製的多成份金屬氧化物靶
材，配合RF磁控濺鍍法及濺鍍條件的控制製
備n-type ITO、IZO、AZO薄膜。而p-type的
氧化亞銅及AZO薄膜則可以利用金屬及AZO
靶材，在控制的氣氛下以RF反應性磁控濺鍍
進行鍍製。以AZO薄膜為例，以AZO (2 wt% 
Al)氧化物靶材及氬氣為工作氣體，在基板與
靶材之間的距離為5公分，基板溫度為
300℃，濺鍍壓力為6 mtorr，濺鍍功率為80 W
的濺鍍條件下，所得的AZO薄膜為n-type，且
其電阻係數為1.92×10-3 Ω-cm，可見光穿透率
為85%。以相同的靶材並在相同的濺鍍條件
下，改以氬氣和笑氣做為反應氣體鍍製AZO
薄膜，發現當通入的笑氣比例介於10%~30%
之間，AZO薄膜經由霍爾效應分析儀測試為
p-type，而其電阻係數由1.8 Ω-cm 增加至 
157 Ω-cm。 
六、計畫成果自評內容 
    本計畫已達成第一年度預定之目標，且
於本年度完成以濺鍍法製備 n-type ITO、IZO
及 AZO 薄膜及 p-type 氧化亞銅與 AZO 透明
導電薄膜的製備，並探討濺鍍與溶液法之製
程條件對薄膜性質的影響。未來將於後續計
畫中，利用本計劃所合成之靶材及獲得的薄
膜製程條件，來進行 TCO 太陽能元件的製
備，並探討材料組合、元件設計及製程條件
的改變對 TCO 太陽能元件光電轉換特性的
影響，以作為後續開發及改良 TCO 太陽能電
池元件之參考。第一年度研究成果，已陸續

一、參加會議經過 
此次研討會會議是在中國大陸上海市張江高科技園區之 Riverfront Business Hotel 舉行，會議名
稱為 IEEE International Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC 2008)，而此會議主要在討論奈米材料相關
的應用，會議的時間是在 2008 年 3 月 24 日至 3 月 27 日期間展開，在會議第二天本人搭乘中華航空
CI641 航班由桃園國際機場飛往中國大陸上海浦東機場。此次會議由 IEEE 新加坡的分會(Singapore 
Section 之 Laser Electro-optics 及 Nanotechnology Chapters 主辦，每兩年舉辦一次。本次會議共發表
497 篇 paper，共分為 40 個 technical sessions 來發表研究成果，共有來自美國、歐洲、日本、韓國、
中國及台灣等 30 國家的學者參與。 
 此次的會議內容涵蓋了 Nanomaterials and Nanostructures、Nanowires and Nanotubes、
Nanomagnetics and Spintronics、Nanoscale Modeling & Simulation、Nanophotonics、
Nano-devices/Nano-systems and reliability、Nanometrology/Nanomanipulation/Nanofabrication、Carbon 
Nanotubes(CNT)、Molecular Electronics、Nano-Bio Systems、Nanotechnology Ventures，在會議期間由
的許多學者專家報告其研究成果或是在相關領域新的發展趨勢。本人除分別在 3 月 26 日下午（研討

 另外，FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc. 的 Dr. Jan Sumerel 在其受邀在 Nanomaterials and Nanostructures 演
講中談論到如何利用噴墨裝置之噴墨孔表面的膜層塗佈處理，來避免奈米塗料在經過噴墨孔時液滴
的聚集，而影響噴墨列印的解析度及品質，以排除日後以噴墨列印取代目前現行以昂貴且複雜微影
及蝕刻步驟，來半導體及光電裝置之電路圖案路的障礙。因本人目前正著手開發以奈米透明導電氧
化物(transparent conductive oxide, TCO)粉體製備之透明導電塗料及製程的開發，也嘗試開發透明導電
塗料在軟性基板上製程。藉由與 Dr. Sumerel 討論所獲得的構思及啟發，將在相關的製程上進行改進，
以作為透明討電塗料以噴墨列方式在軟性基板上鍍膜之參考。同時也邀請 Dr. Sumerel 於 2008 年 9 月
至台灣業務考察時，在進行後續討論。 
    此次會議本人最大的感觸乃在於目賭中國在經濟實力強大後，其在奈米及光電科技相關的學術
研究的資源及成果也迅速累積的狀況。相對於以中國十幾幾億的人口及全世界最多的外匯存底做為
經濟、科技及學術發展的雄厚後盾，台灣如何在後續的科技、學術上能集中精力發展並保留自己的
競爭優勢，是值得政府、產業界及學術界來多加思考的!

Fig.1 Experimental flowchart for the preparation and characterization of CAO 
nano-powders 
 
III. RESULTS DISCUSSION 
A. Effect of Calcination Temperature 
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the powders produced 
by calcining the dried co-precipitate precursors of CAO with 
molar ratio Cu/Al=1 in air for 4 hours at different temperatures. 
For the co-precipitates calcined at 1000℃, only diffraction 
peaks of CuO and CuAl2O4 could be identified in the 
diffraction pattern (Fig. 2a). However, when the calcination 
temperature was raised to 1100℃, diffraction peaks of CuAlO2 
can also be found in the diffraction pattern (Fig. 2b) in addition 
to those of CuO and CuAl2O4. Finally, when the calcination 
temperature was raised to 1200℃, almost all the diffraction 
peaks from CuO and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CuAl2O4 are disappeared and only those of CuAlO2 can be 
identified in the diffraction pattern (Fig. 2c). Experimental 
results of Park et. al. [11] indicated that when the mixture of 
CuO and Al2O3 was heated between 1069℃and 1095℃, the 
mixture transformed into CuAlO2 powders with Rhombohedral 
structure. However, when the mixture was heated above 
1300℃, significant weight loss and phase separation were 
observed. From the literature and the experimental results 
shown above, it can be inferred that when the dried 
co-precipitates were calcined below 1100℃, the amorphous 
precursors first transformed into CuO and CuAl2O4. The 
absence of CuAlO2 from the calcined powders indicates that 
there was not enough energy to transform CuO and CuAl2O4 
into CuAlO2 according to the following reactions:  
CuO  +  CuAl2O4    <--->     CuAlO2 + 1/2 O2           
(1) 
However, when the calcination temperature was raised 
above 1100℃, there was enough energy for CuO and CuAl2O4 
to react and to transform into CuAlO2 according to (1). When 
calcined at 1200 for 4 hours in air, almost all the CuO and 
CuAl2O4 in the calcined powders were transformed into 
CuAlO2. 
Table 1 shows the results of EDS determination of Cu/Al 
molar ratio and crystallite size estimation of the powders 
shown in Fig. 2 as well as the resistance measurements of the 
pellets prepared form these powders. It can be observed from 
Table 1 that both the Cu/Al molar ratio of the calcined powders 
and the resistance of the sintered pellet decreased as the 
calcination temperature increased while the crystallite size 
increased with the calcination temperature. Because CuO 
gradually decomposes to Cu2O when heated above 1000℃ and 
the melting point of Cu2O is 1232℃, the Cu/Al molar ratio of 
the calcined powders decreased when the calcination 
temperature increased

Fig.4 XRD patterns of the nano-powders prepared from calcination of the 
dried co-precipitates at 1200℃ for for 4 hours under different atmospheric 
conditions: (a) Ar, (b) N2, and (c) air. 
 
to crystalline transformation and the CuAlO2 formation will be 
slow compared to those in air. These probably lead to the 
observed decrease in both the intensities of the diffraction 
peaks and the crystallite size of CuAlO2 for the powders 
calcined in N2 or Ar. From the resistance measurements of the 
pressed and the sintered pellets, it is obvious that pellets made 
from the CAO powders calcined in air possess the lowest 
resistance. This can again be attributed to the fact that this 
pellet possesses the exact stoichiometry of CuAlO2 with the 
molar ratio of Cu/Al=1. 
 
IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
From the experiment results, it is evident that 
nano-powders of p-type transparent conductive copper 
aluminum oxide can be synthesized by co-precipitation method. 
By calcining the dried co-precipitate precursors at temperature 
above 1100℃, nano-powders of CuAlO2 were produced. After 
calcining at 1200℃ in air for 4 hours, the CAO co-precipitate 
precursors totally transformed into nano-powders of CuAlO2 
with crystal size around 64 nm. Continued calcining at 1200℃ 
above 4 hours led to the decomposition of CuAlO2 into 
nano-powders of CuAl2O4 and volatile CuO with no significant 
change in crystal size. Finally, it was found that by calcining 
under inert atmosphere, the decomposition of CuAlO2 could be 
suppressed at the expense of decreasing its crystallinity.

amount of aluminum nitrate was dissolved in water and then 
added to above zinc nitrate solution. The mixed solution was 
continuously stirred for at least one hour to prepare the 
precursor solution with Zn/Al = 98/2 for subsequent 
co-precipitation. The co-precipitation process was carried out 
in two steps: the solution pH was first adjusted to 5.0 by adding 
adequate amount of ammonium hydroxide and the solution was 
allowed to age for 3 hours; the solution pH was then adjusted 
again to the final pH value by adding ammonium hydroxide to 
obtain the co-precipitate precursors of AZO. The 
co-precipitates were repeatedly washed and filtered several 
times before being dried. The dried co-precipitate precursors 
were then calcined under different conditions. 
The morphology and the compositions of the 
co-precipitate precursors and the calcined powders were 
analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi 
S-3000) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) 
(Hitachi S-3000/Oxford EX-200). The structure and the crystal 
size of the calcined powders were characterized by X-ray 
diffractometry (Bruker’s XAS D5005, Cu K).

III. RESULTS DISCUSSION 
In this work, zinc metals were electrolyzed and dissolved 
in ammonium nitrate solution to produce zinc nitrate solutions 
at three different pH values: 1, 2, and 3.(Table 1) Fig. 2 shows 
the SEM micrographs of the dried co-precipitates prepared 
from the precursor solutions that were made from these three 
different zinc nitrate solutions. From these SEM micrographs, 
it is obvious that the co-precipitate particles are of uniform size 
and shape and are all nano-sized (between 30 to 60 nm). In 
addition, the particle size of the co-precipitates decreases as the 
pH of the electrolyte solution increases. Figure 3 shows the 
XRD patterns of the powders produced by calcining the dried 
co-precipitate precursors prepared from AZO1 precursor 
solution in air for 2 hours at different temperatures. For the 
co-precipitates calcined above 800℃, single phase AZO with 
wurtzite structure could be identified in the diffraction patterns 
and the intensities of the diffraction peaks of AZO increase as 
the calcination temperature increases. However, when the 
calcination temperature was raised above 1000 ℃ , the 
intensities of the AZO diffraction peaks decreases. This might 
be resulted from the fact that Al+3 will have enough energy to 
diffuse into ZnO lattice and to replace Zn+2 when heated above 
1000℃, which leads to the less ordered wurtzite structure and 
the decrease in both crystallite size and diffraction peak 
intensity of AZO. 
Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of the powders 
produced by calcining the dried co-precipitate precursors 
prepared three different precursor solutions at 1000℃ in air 
for 2 hours. It is obvious from the XRD patterns that the 
intensities of the diffraction peaks of AZO decrease as the pH 
of the electrolyte solution increases. This indicates that both the 
crystal size and the crystallinity of the AZO powders decrease 
as the pH of the electrolyte solution increases. This inference 
can be verified by the SEM micrographs (Fig. 5) of these 
calcined powders. As the pH of the electrolyte solution 
decreases, the average particle size of the calcined powders 
becomes larger (from 200 nm to 500 nm). In addition, both the 
particle shape and the particle size distribution of the calcined 
powders become non-uniform with particle size ranging from 
less than 100 nm to larger than 1 micrometer. From the EDS 
determination of Zn/Al in the calcined co-precipitates, the 
Zn/Al ratios remain the almost same throughout the synthesis 
with slight decrease in zinc content as the pH of the electrolyte 
solution increases. When calcining the co-precipitates prepared 
from higher pH electrolyte solutions at high temperature, zinc 
oxide might tend to decompose and become volatile as 
compared to the refractory aluminum oxide, due to the fact that 
the particle size of the co-precipitates become ssmaller and the 
specific area of co-precipitates becomes larger. This might lead 
to the observed decrease in both the intensities and the Zn/Al 
ratios of the AZO powders prepared from higher pH electrolyte 
solutions.

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
From the experiment results, it is evident that 
nano-powders of aluminum-doped zinc oxide can be 
synthesized by electrolysis-modified co-precipitation method. 
By calcining the dried co-precipitate precursors at temperature 
above 800℃, crystalline AZO nano-powders were produced. 
After calcining at 1000℃  in air for 2 hours, nano-sized 
powders of AZO with ZnO wurtzite structure and particle size 
between 200 to 500 nm were synthesized. Finally, it was found 
that both the particle sizes of co-precipitate precursors and 
calcined nano-powders of AZO could be decreased by 
increasing the pH of the electrolyte solution for electrolytic 
dissolution.

III. RESULTS DISCUSSION 
A. Effect of Calcination Temperature 
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the powders produced 
by calcining the dried co-precipitate precursors of CAO with 
molar ratio Cu/Al=1 in air for 4 hours at different temperatures. 
For the co-precipitates calcined at 1000℃, only diffraction 
peaks of CuO and CuAl2O4 could be identified in the 
diffraction pattern (Fig. 2a). However, when the calcination 
temperature was raised to 1100℃, diffraction peaks of CuAlO2 
can also be found in the diffraction pattern (Fig. 2b) in addition 
to those of CuO and CuAl2O4. Finally, when the calcination 
temperature was raised to 1200℃, almost all the diffraction 
peaks from CuO and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CuAl2O4 are disappeared and only those of CuAlO2 can be 
identified in the diffraction pattern (Fig. 2c). Experimental 
results of Park et. al. [11] indicated that when the mixture of 
CuO and Al2O3 was heated between 1069℃and 1095℃, the 
mixture transformed into CuAlO2 powders with Rhombohedral 
structure. However, when the mixture was heated above 
1300℃, significant weight loss and phase separation were 
observed. From the literature and the experimental results 
shown above, it can be inferred that when the dried 
co-precipitates were calcined below 1100℃, the amorphous 
precursors first transformed into CuO and CuAl2O4. The 
absence of CuAlO2 from the calcined powders indicates that 
there was not enough energy to transform CuO and CuAl2O4 
into CuAlO2 according to the following reactions:  
CuO  +  CuAl2O4    <--->     CuAlO2 + 1/2 O2           
(1) 
However, when the calcination temperature was raised 
above 1100℃, there was enough energy for CuO and CuAl2O4 
to react and to transform into CuAlO2 according to (1). When 
calcined at 1200 for 4 hours in air, almost all the CuO and 
CuAl2O4 in the calcined powders were transformed into 
CuAlO2. 
Table 1 shows the results of EDS determination of Cu/Al 
molar ratio and crystallite size estimation of the powders 
shown in Fig. 2 as well as the resistance measurements of the 
pellets prepared form these powders. It can be observed from 
Table 1 that both the Cu/Al molar ratio of the calcined powders 
and the resistance of the sintered pellet decreased as the 
calcination temperature increased while the crystallite size 
increased with the calcination temperature. Because CuO 
gradually decomposes to Cu2O when heated above 1000℃ and 
the melting point of Cu2O is 1232℃, the Cu/Al molar ratio of 
the calcined powders decreased when the calcination 
temperature increased

to crystalline transformation and the CuAlO2 formation will be 
slow compared to those in air. These probably lead to the 
observed decrease in both the intensities of the diffraction 
peaks and the crystallite size of CuAlO2 for the powders 
calcined in N2 or Ar. From the resistance measurements of the 
pressed and the sintered pellets, it is obvious that pellets made 
from the CAO powders calcined in air possess the lowest 
resistance. This can again be attributed to the fact that this 
pellet possesses the exact stoichiometry of CuAlO2 with the 
molar ratio of Cu/Al=1. 
 
IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
From the experiment results, it is evident that 
nano-powders of p-type transparent conductive copper 
aluminum oxide can be synthesized by co-precipitation method. 
By calcining the dried co-precipitate precursors at temperature 
above 1100℃, nano-powders of CuAlO2 were produced. After 
calcining at 1200℃ in air for 4 hours, the CAO co-precipitate 
precursors totally transformed into nano-powders of CuAlO2 
with crystal size around 64 nm. Continued calcining at 1200℃ 
above 4 hours led to the decomposition of CuAlO2 into 
nano-powders of CuAl2O4 and volatile CuO with no significant 
change in crystal size. Finally, it was found that by calcining 
under inert atmosphere, the decomposition of CuAlO2 could be 
suppressed at the expense of decreasing its crystallinity.
