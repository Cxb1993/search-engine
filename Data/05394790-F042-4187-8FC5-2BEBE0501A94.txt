process (AHP) in the perspective of fourth-party logistics to build a model for 3PL 
provider selection. In their model, decision-makers select the most suitable 3PL 
provider by the weights generated by AHP. Aguezzoul et al. (2006) used the 
ELECTER approach to build a 3PL selection system. Min and Joo (2006) evaluated 
the operation efficiency of 3PL providers using five quantitative indexes, including 
operating income, accounts receivable, salaries and wages, operating expenses, 
property and equipment. They adopted the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method 
to select decision-making units that have higher efficiency. Zhao et al. (2006) 
established a 3PL provider selection approach from fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. 
Jharkharia and Shankar (2007) proposed a method that involves the analytic network 
process (ANP). Their study offered decision-makers a procedure for selecting a 
proper 3PL provider. Their proposed method begins first with an initial evaluation of 
3PL providers, followed by the final evaluation using ANP. They suggested that the 
suitable number of providers that enter the second process should be between 3 and 
5. 
 
However, the MADM approach has a fatal problem: the 3PL provider selection 
problem considers limited resources (e.g., capacity constraints and budget 
constraints), and makes it difficult for decision-makers to judge a feasible solution 
domain. Previous research was also on 3PL provider selection methods that involve 
mathematical programming. Tyan et al. (2003) solved a freight consolidation 
problem in a global 3PL distribution alliance. They minimized the freight 
consolidation operation cost and capacity loss cost by integer programming. Ko et al. 
(2006) developed a mixed integer programming for 3PL distribution network 
problem, and solved the problem using genetic algorithms. Moreover, their work 
also evaluated capacity planning of the warehouses by simulation tools under the 
uncertainty of service time. The mathematical approaches possess a critical 
insufficiency. For 3PL provider selection, mathematical programming cannot 
incorporate decision-makers’ scores for qualitative evaluation. Decision-makers are 
sure about objective functions and constraints only, but they do not know the 
selection process. Table 1 summarizes the difference between this research and 
similar studies. As can be seen, under the global supply chain situation, it is clear 
that previous studies do not take into consideration flexible resource constraints, and 
do not have a multi-criteria 3PL provider selection system with providers’ interaction 
incorporated. Moreover, Araz et al. (2007) developed a logistic outsourcing provider 
selection methodology that integrated PROMETHEE and fuzzy goal programming 
(FGP). In the first phase, PROMETHEE is employed to decide providers’ weights 
for constructing a FGP model. This approach incorporates experts’ evaluation into 
mathematical models. However, the approach from Araz et al. (2007) did not 
consider interactions among criteria or among 3PL providers. In practice, 3PL 
providers may have interactions due to alliance. This paper proposes using 
3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP to improve the insufficiencies above. 
 
2.2  Fuzzy analytic network process 
Analytic hierarchy process, proposed by Saaty (Saaty, 1980), is a multi-criteria 
decision-making method. This method is widely applied in various domains. The 
main function of AHP is to transform a complex problem into a hierarchical model. 
AHP is generally composed of three parts: goal, criteria and alternatives. In some 
situations, the criteria may include several sub-criteria. This model is a linear 
top-to-bottom form, and each element in the model is independent of each other. The  
 4
 
main processes of AHP are: (1) constructing hierarchy architectures, (2) constructing 
pair-wise comparison matrixes of the hierarchy, (3) calculating criteria’s weights and 
testing their consistency, and (4) calculating alternatives’ priority weight. 
 
When there exist interactions among the clusters of the decision problem, or 
among the elements, AHP is not applicable. Analytic network process (ANP) extends 
AHP and incorporates a feedback mechanism. ANP is a nonlinear system (i.e., 
network model) (Saaty, 1996). In the ANP process, problems are divided into clusters, 
which include elements. Then, the comparison matrixes are built. ANP employs a 
super-matrix to evaluate outer dependence, inner dependence and the relative weights 
of the elements. The outer dependence is the interaction among clusters, and the inner 
dependence is the interaction among elements within a cluster. However, both AHP 
and ANP require a consistency test for each comparison matrix during the calculation. 
When the consistency ratio is larger than 0.1, decision-makers are not consistent in 
their decisions concerning the comparison matrix. As a result, decision-makers must 
make trivial corrections to those inconsistent matrixes, and evaluate again the weights 
of the elements. Mikhailov (2003) proposed an AHP approach, based on fuzzy 
preference programming (FPP), which averts the correction processes due to 
inconsistent comparison matrixes. The FPP approach calculates effectively 
comparison matrixes that possess crisp, interval and fuzzy judgments. FPP resolves 
this problem of inconsistent judgments by decision-makers using the concepts of 
tolerance parameters. This approach originates from the preference programming 
method proposed by Arbel (1989),and Arbel and Vargas (1993). However, Arbel’s 
method may yield a result without a feasible solution. FPP transforms the weight 
calculation method into a fuzzy programming problem. Mikhailov and Tsvetinov 
(2004) utilized the non-linear programming FPP method and proposed a fuzzy AHP 
(FAHP). In the FPP method, there are fewer execution steps in non-linear 
programming than in linear programming. In this paper, the non-linear FPP method is 
utilized to construct the FANP. An example is also provided to demonstrate the 
implementation process. In practice, 3PL providers may cooperate with each other, 
and those evaluation criteria possess interactions. Therefore, FANP is suitable for 
developing the methodology in this paper. 
 
3. FANP&PFIGP development 
The method in this paper is suitable for enterprises that decide to outsource 
partial or whole logistics operations. Different from previous studies, this paper 
proposes FANP&PFIGP which focuses on integrating experts’ scores into 
mathematical programming. Moreover, in the MADM model, FANP considers the 
interactions among criteria and among 3PL providers. Decision variables for 
3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP are 0-1 integers. Flexible resource constraints are also 
considered. Therefore, PFIGP is utilized to construct a decision problem of job 
assignment. 
 
3.1 Framework of selection method 
This paper aims to develop a decision support system, FANP&PFIGP, which 
considers both qualitative and quantitative criteria, for selecting 3PL providers. First, 
during execution, the decision-makers must identify the logistics operations that need 
 6
 
3.2 Evaluation criteria 
Selection of a suitable strategic partner requires the consideration of several 
qualitative and quantitative criteria. Enterprises should select their own focused 
criteria for 3PL provider selection. In this paper, 128 sub-criteria are summarized for 
enterprises to evaluate 3PL providers under a global supply chain environment. 
Global supply chain management is a technique, used for global enterprise 
management and planning among enterprises, customers and collaborators. Through 
information transparency, the goals of increasing customer satisfaction and lowering 
overall supply chain stock level are achieved (Meixell and Gargeya, 2005). In an 
environment of market globalization, transportation cost increases. The differences in 
culture, language and business units’ policy execution among different areas makes 
global supply chain more difficult to manage. 3PL provider selection under 
globalization includes six selection criteria: globalization considerations, relationship 
building and integration competencies, operational performance, quality, finance, and 
information technology, which are shown in appendix A. 
 
3.3 3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP formulation 
The purpose of this PFIGP is to conduct a job assignment by providing a 
satisfying solution. GP was first proposed by Charnes and Cooper (1955). To make a 
solution achieve the target of the decision-maker means minimizing the overall 
deviations. In GP problems, fuzzy objective function or constraints shift the feasible 
area. This is fuzzy goal programming (FGP). The decision problem of flexible 
resource limitation is often seen in practice. Kumar et al. (2004) solved the vendor 
selection problem with fuzzy mixed integer goal programming. This problem 
considers multiple objectives decision planning, and is suitable when goals are not 
clearly stated. Furthermore, Kumar et al. (2006) proposed a vendor selection problem 
that considers both fuzzy objective function and fuzzy limitation function. However, 
these methods cannot guarantee that a feasible solution domain exists under 
designated fuzzy resources. Fabian and Stoical (1984) proposed a method that 
implements penalty function and transforms the fuzzy integer programming problem 
into a nonlinear integer programming problem. This transformation increases the 
number of decision variables. This proposed PFIGP considers a two-phase penalty 
function. In this paper, fuzzy resource is used to demonstrate the flexibility of 
resource, and the model of Fabian and Stoical is extended to develop a preemptive 
fuzzy integer goal programming problem. The proposed model does not increase the 
number of decision variables. 
 
3.3.1 Assumptions and notations 
In this paper, supply chain members include a manufacturer (i.e., upstream 
member), multiple 3PL providers and multiple wholesalers (i.e., downstream 
member). The main decision point of 3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP is to select a suitable 
3PL provider and to transport the jobs to the wholesaler. The assumptions of this 
problem include the following: (1) jobs are certain and known, (2) each assignment 
cannot be separated, and (3) logistic outsourcing cost of enterprises is calculated 
according to number of jobs. In the following section, legends of 
3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP are defined as follows:

tolerance. However, the deviation falling within the tolerance may cause varying 
degrees of penalty. The proposed PFIGP does not cause deviation within the tolerance 
range, but it cause penalties. If it deviates outside the tolerance, both deviation and 
penalties are generated. This paper considers flexible resources, such as budget 
resources, 3PL providers’ load capacity and delivery time. The mathematical 
programming model of the proposed 3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP is given as follows: 
 
(1) Objective function 
The purpose of the PFIGP is to minimize overall deviation. The objective 
function includes deviations of selecting FANP weighted providers, capacity and 
delivery times, as shown in equation (1).

where lexmin represents lexicographically minimizing the deviational variables. 
 
(2) Goal constraints 
Goal 1: FANP score maximization 
Equation (2) selects FANP weights of 3PL providers. The objective function of 
goal constraint is for the under-achievement (negative) deviation. For instance, 
when 1 1x  , 11Vd  =0. In equation (1), it is clear that if iw is larger, its decision for 1Vid  is 
0, which means the decision for ix is 1.

Goal 2: Not to exceed available budget resources 
Equation (3) is the budget resource constraint. Under this constraint, the solution 
should not exceed the budget that enterprises are willing to invest in logistic 
operations, and the budget resources are flexible. The objective function of goal 
constraint is the over-achievement (positive) deviation, which means minimizing the 
exceeded amount of investment.

Goal 3: Not to exceed load capacity 
Equation (4) is the capacity constraint. Under this constraint, the solution should 
not exceed the load capacity of 3PL providers. The objective function of goal 
constraint is the positive deviation, which means minimizing the exceeded load 
capacity.

Goal 4: Delivery time limit 
In the proposed problem, when products are delivered to the wholesaler, time 
constraints should be considered. The 3PL delivery time cannot exceed the time 
window set by wholesalers, as shown in equation (5). The constraint equation can be 
further transformed into equations (6) and (7). Equation (6) is the wholesalers’ lower 
time constraint for product delivery, and the objective function of constraints is for 
negative deviation. Equation (7) is wholesalers’ upper time constraint for product

3.4 Genetic algorithms in 3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP 
Genetic algorithm (GA) is seen as a global search approach. During calculation, 
each solution is called a chromosome, and each generation’s population is assembled 
with chromosomes. Each generation generates new chromosomes, which are called 
offspring, by mutation and crossover. Then, chromosomes that sustain to the next 
generation are picked according to their fitness value. Chromosomes with higher 
fitness values are more likely to be picked. Genetic algorithm facilitates such 
evolutionary process to increase the probability of discovering the best global 
solutions. Some decision problems consider multiple objective programming. Such 
problems help decision-makers find a non-dominated solution (i.e., Pareto optimal 
solution) under limited resources, and try to achieve every goal. In practice, it is 
sometimes difficult for decision-makers to define useable resources. Improper 
resource configurations may not yield any feasible solution. To avoid a situation 
where there is no feasible domain, this paper uses GP to solve the decision problem. 
The purpose of GP is to minimize achieved deviations for each goal. Gen et al. (1997) 
proposed a real coded GA approach to solve non-preemptive fuzzy nonlinear goal 
programming, and proved that it is a powerful method. This paper solved the 
3PLPSPWFRC_PFIGP using this real coded GA approach. The problem proposed is a 
preemptive goal programming problem. Such a problem is different from multiple 
objective programming. Objectives that are more important (i.e., of the upper level) 
are optimized before lower-level goals for their higher priorities. The procedure of GA 
is shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2. Pseudo-code for GA. 
 
3.4.1 Solution code and initialization 
For the algorithm proposed in this paper, only key deviational variables ijkx have 
to be determined, and then ix can then be observed. When the 3PL provider i does not 
any designated jobs, ix =0; otherwise, ix =1. DefineV = 
[ jkg | j =1,2,…, 1n ; k =1,2,…, 2n ] is a chromosome in a population. jkg denotes a 3PL 
supplier, which is jkg Î3PL supplier i, assigned by wholesaler j for job k. For

In the same priority level, each goal has the same importance. Therefore, the 
goals possess additivity. 
Step 2 Sort chromosomes on the value of the 1p objective. If some chromosomes have 
the same objective value, this paper sort them, based on the value of 
the 2p objective. dp denotes the priority level d ( dp >> 1dp  d .) 
Steps 3 In Step 2, chromosomes are sorted in ascending order by the overall objective 
value. Therefore, the fitness value of order 1’s chromosome is the largest. In 
this algorism, fitness values of chromosomes are calculated according to their 
rank. The calculation of the fitness function is shown in equation (20).

where kw  is the rank of chromosome kV  ,e.g., 1w , which shows that 1V  is the best 
chromosome. a is a parameter in [0, 1]. 
 
The selection process determines the probability for each chromosome to sustain 
the next generation according to its fitness value. This GA uses the following roulette 
wheel method to generate new generations.

4. Numerical analysis 
This paper presents an illustrative example to demonstrate the FANP&PFIGP 
approach. In this example, a manufacturer dispatches a suitable 3PL provider to 
deliver the job to global wholesalers. First, the 3PL provider weight of qualitative 
criteria is generated through FANP. PFIGP is used for job assigning. 
 
4.1. Establishing weight using FANP 
Before operating this proposed system, preceding logistics outsourcing 
procedures must be accomplished, including the gathering of 3PL provider 
information, evaluating if the logistics operation requires outsourcing, and deciding 
the 3PL provider candidate list. This illustrative example includes three candidate 3PL 
providers { 1P , 2P , 3P }. First, in Step 0, suitable evaluation criteria are determined. 3PL 
selection criteria vary among industries, and even among enterprises. Therefore, it is 
suggested that enterprises’ decision-makers and professionals should select candidate 
criteria according to appendix A in this paper. The remaining procedures of the 
illustrative example’s application of FANP are shown as follows: 
Step 1 Construct network structures: network structures are constructed according to

The matrixes of Table 3 compare sub-criteria weight at the second level, with 
respect to the GC and QU. The matrixes of Table 4 compare 3PL provider weight at 
the third level with respect to criteria NT, GS, RD, and QS. Table 5 shows the 
matrixes among interdependent 3PL provider’s degree of relative impact for each 
provider individually.

Step 6 Output: Obtain the final priority weights from steady-state super-matrix. In the 
ready-state super-matrix, it is clear that the final weights of 1P , 2P , and 3P are 0.35, 0.2, 
and 0.45, respectively. Provider 2P has a higher weight in global criteria, however, 
FANP in this example considers the providers’ interdependence relationship, and 
renders the weight of provider 3P the highest. In Table 6, the interdependent provider’s 
degree of relative impact of 2P is the lowest. On the contrary, its final weight is the 
lowest.

Furthermore, this paper considers three additional interdependent provider’s 
degrees of relative impact, including AHP, FANP 1 and FANP 2. AHP is a linear 
model that does not consider 3PL providers’ interaction. FANP 1 and FANP2’s 
interdependence weight matrix of 3PL provider is shown in Table 8, and their 
remaining sub-matrix in steady-state super-matrix is shown in Table 7. The model in 
the original illustrative example is called FANP3.

Furthermore, Figure 5 shows the comparison of some 3PL providers’ normalized 
parameters, including iw , iFC , iU , and 2

ip . The parameters of the three 3PL providers 
are normalized to sum up to one. Although the FANP weight of 3PL provider 2P  in 
this paper is the lowest, its capacity is the highest. The GA parameter configuration 
refers to the results of Gen et al. (1997).The parameter configuration includes: H = 
10000, _pop size = 30, pm = 0.1, pc = 0.4, 1λ = 0.45, 2λ = 0.55, b = 0.4 and a = 
0.1. Figure 6 demonstrates the optimal solution for each generation during

consider fuzzy resource limitation and professionals’ evaluation. It varies from 
traditional GP, because the proposed approach helps decision-makers understand the 
planning result and the importance of criteria. However, the MADM approach 
possesses a fatal problem: the 3PL provider selection problem considers limited 
resources (e.g., capacity constraints and budget constraints), and makes it difficult for 
the decision-maker to judge a feasible solution domain. In the proposed method, the 
3PL provider scores of professionals are first generated by FANP. In this part, the 
interactions among criteria and among providers are considered. Then, these FANP 
weights are integrated into preemptive fuzzy integer goal programming proposed and 
a real coded GA is used to solve the problem. This PFIGP considers the penalty value 
of two phases according to the tolerance of resource limitation. In practice, enterprises 
face the global market and the supply chain members must cooperate with each other. 
Therefore, it is important for decision-makers to have a critical approach to consider 
provider interactions and flexible resource limitations. 
 
The experiment in the illustrative example shows that different provider 
interactions cause varying final FANP weights. If decision-makers do not consider the 
relationship of interactions, the result varies. According to the proposed approach, 
even a provider with higher FANP may not be selected because it exceeds too much 
the resource limitation. In particular, when the penalty is higher, the provider that 
exceeds resource tolerance will be less acceptable. For proposed method, it is easier to 
know if the degree of a provider’s deviation is acceptable. It is harder for traditional 
MADM to make similar evaluation. The proposed method also prevents 
decision-makers from setting improper resource configuration, which yields no 
feasible solution domain. To deal with the issues of future research, this paper 
suggests the following. (1) The methodology in this paper can be further applied in 
specific practical industry (i.e., semiconductor or textile processing industries). Such 
research tries to discover key criteria of provider selection for the industry, and how to 
apply the approach in specific area. (2) Under the framework of this paper’s method, 
PFIGP is employed to solve the 3PL selection problem with asymmetric information, 
which is common in practice. (3) The decision support system can be further extended 
and developed into intelligent software to illustrate the practical application 
performance.

1. Introduction 
Determining proper production and replenishment quantity is one of the critical and 
active research topics of supply chains. To increase competitiveness and efficiency, upstream 
and downstream members of the packing industry usually integrate as a supply chain. 
Because of weather conditions, the acquired quantity of industrial raw materials tends to be 
non-deterministic and uncontrollable during the farming process. Such raw materials also 
deteriorate easily. Therefore, in this complex environment, decision makers need a decision 
support system to determine a proper budget and reduce the raw material deterioration. In 
previous studies, replenishment problems seldom considered non-deterministic raw material 
and demand. Vidal and Goetschalckx (1997) reviewed some important works about 
production and distribution models. This paper adopted a decision support system, based on 
artificial intelligence to solve a stochastic replenishment problem. 
This paper proposes a bi-level programming problem. The upper level problem is 
stochastic. This section determines the budget to reduce raw materials’ deterioration rate. The 
lower level problem is a replenishment problem during simulation. For non-deterministic 
problems, simulation methods are usually adopted to evaluate inventory policy performance. 
To evaluate the impact of electronic data interchange on the bullwhip effect, Machuca and 
Barajas (2004) used the simulation model to measure inventory costs, orders placed and the 
cumulative cost in supply chain. Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) adopted simulation models to 
examine the impact of inventory inaccuracy on performance in the supply chain. By 
reviewing these works, it’s clear that past studies adopted simulation methods to evaluate 
inventory policy performance for replenishment problems. Ravichandran (2007) proposed a 
simulation method to optimize the joint ordering policy for stochastic demand in the supply 
chain. In his model, strategy choices include a periodic review policy, a reorder point, 
economic an order quantity and Newsboy approximation. However, his decision system is 
not for bi-level programming. The problem proposed in this paper is a stochastic bi-level 
programming problem, and the simulation process includes a replenishment problem. The 
replenishment problem is NP-hard. This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic lot-sizing 
problem with asymmetric deteriorating commodity (SDLSPADC). Artificial intelligence 
techniques are becoming more and more advanced and widely implemented. This paper 
adopts an intelligent decision system based on artificial neural network, data mining and ant 
colony optimization (neuro-DM&ACO) to solve the proposed bi-level programming. During 
the simulation process, this simulation-based optimization system includes an NP-hard 
replenishment problem (i.e., lower level problem). 
 
2. SDLSPADC description 
The stochastic dynamic lot-sizing problem in this paper is a replenishment planning 
problem that takes asymmetric deteriorating commodity into account. In this proposed

The larger the decision variable 2o  is, the smaller the raw material deterioration rate will be.

3. Neuro-DM&ACO for SDLSPADC 
Wong et al. (2007) proposed an intelligent system to determine the semiconductor’s 
process parameters. However, their work did not compare the performance between the 
proposed method and RSM. This paper applies their method to find the near-optimal decision 
variables 1o and 2o .  
3.1. Framework of Decision Support System 
This methodology is a system based on ACO, the C5.0 data mining algorithm, and 
back-propagation network (BPN). First, the RSM is used to determine the adequate range of 
training data. Second, this system applies BPN to construct the relationship between the 
decision variables and the expected total cost. Third, the C5.0 data mining algorithm is used 
to extract the classification rules in the BPN model. Finally, the extracted classification rules 
are used to develop a real-valued ACO, to find the optimal decision variables. The structure 
of this system is shown in figure 1. During the simulation process, this paper applies the 
modified ACO approach to solve lower level problems.

where kijP is the probability of ant k choosing interval j in the decision variable i. 
Parameters α and β are used to vary the relative importance of the trail intensity ( )ij t and the 
heuristic measure (i.e., visibility) ij , respectively. τij is the intensity of the pheromone trail of 
the interval j in the decision variable i. ηij is the heuristic measure of the interval j in the 
decision variable i (ηij = 1/dij). dij is the average weight of the interval j in the decision 
variable i. This average weight is constructed in accordance with the classification rules of 
C5.0 data mining algorithm. G(i) is the set of intervals existing in the decision variable i. 
The mutation conditions of this algorithm are identical to those of Wong et al. (2009b). 
When the conditions are satisfied, a new interval is selected randomly in the interval chosen 
by the solution. This paper calculates the amount of pheromone trails set by the ant k as

The parameters of the SDLSPADC used to carry out neuro-DM&ACO are set as 2th = 
0.05, 1th = 0.6, 1tK = 170, 2tp = 1, 1tp = 0.8, and 1ts = 3, for t = 1, 2,..., 15. 1 = 0.2, 2 = 0.3, 1 = 
0.2, and 2 = 0.4. tb  is the discrete uniform distribution between 19 and 21 and td  between 
9 and 11. This paper uses a three-layer back-propagation neural network (BPN) to construct 
the simulation model. The BPN construction is completed through the trainbpx function of 
MATLAB. The BPN parameters are momentum = 0.9 and the number of hidden nodes = 2. 
In figure 4 is the comparison between the BPN output Y  and test data of this model. 
 
Figure 4. Comparison of the fact values and BPN output values: Test data (normalize) 
 
Respectively, o1 and o2 generate 81 sums of data (normalize) based on the 9 levels of 0, 
0.125, 0.25,..., 1 and generate 19 sums of data randomly for training data of C5.0 data mining 
algorithm. Categorize BPN output data into 3 groups: class-a, class-b, and class-c, as in table
