提出 RBDO 演算法，其細節略述如下。 
A stable Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) algorithm is proposed to 
produce an optimal design with a desired reliability. The main idea behind the 
proposed approach is to use a set of deterministic variables, called auxiliary design 
points, to replace the random parameters (RPs). Thus, the reliability analysis (RA) in 
the inner loop of an RBDO problem is relaxed. To find the auxiliary design points, an 
optimization problem (called the-problem in this study) in which the goal is to 
locate the position of the probabilistic constraints of an RBDO problem is solved. The 
locations of the probabilistic constraints vary depending on the values of the RPs and 
the design variables (DVs). By assuming that the locations of probabilistic constraints 
are fixed for a given set of design variables, the goal of the -problem is changed to 
finding the locations of the mean values of the "pseudo" random parameters. The 
auxiliary design points are updated using the sums of the auxiliary design points and 
the differences between the mean values of the "pseudo" and actual random 
parameters in the previous step. The auxiliary design points determined above force 
the iteration of deterministic optimization (DO, called the -problem in this study) to 
the vicinity of the probabilistic boundary. Note that in the proposed method, the 
coupled RA and DO are decomposed to form a weakly coupled system with 
sub-systems of the - and -problems. The stability and accuracy of the proposed 
method were investigated through linear and nonlinear numerical problems.

which a surrogate model is built using a Taylor series to approximate the reliability of 
each design trial. The necessary sensitivity information in the Taylor series is 
calculated through a simulation-based RA method, such as Monte-Carlo simulation 
(MCS), to prevent inaccurate probability estimations if the reliability constraints are 
highly nonlinear and to extend the applicability of the RBDO algorithm to an RBDO 
problem involving system reliability.  
Liang et al. (2008) proposed a single-loop RBDO algorithm to lessen the 
computational burden of a traditional RBDO approach. In their proposed method, the 
nested optimization loops are collapsed, and an equivalent single-loop optimization 
process is formulated using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of 
the inner reliability loops in the outer design optimization loop. The accuracy of the 
proposed algorithm is ensured by comparing the optimal designs with results obtained 
from the double-loop approach. Shan and Wang (2008) proposed another single-loop 
approach in which the deterministic feasible domain is replaced by the reliable design 
space (RDS) based on probabilistic requirements. An RBDO problem becomes a 
simple, deterministic optimization problem constrained by the RDS. The RDS is 
found using the partial derivatives at the current design point as an approximation of 
the derivatives at its corresponding most probable point (MPP) on the limit state 
function. Wu (2001) and Qu and Haftka (2002) incorporated the concept of a 
safety-factor with the RBDO problem and proposed another single-loop algorithm.  
These approaches focus on decoupling the double-loop calculation to simplify the 
optimization procedure. Another common remedy is to use a surrogate model (e.g., 
response surface) to take advantage of the computational efficiency of a lower order 
polynomial function (Myers and Montgomery 2002; Youn and Choi 2004). In this 
case, an RBDO problem is replaced by a surrogate model and is conducted through a 
double-loop procedure.  
For practical engineers, in addition to the computational cost consideration, the 
accuracy of the derived optimum design also needs to be ensured. Many factors have 
influences on optimization results, for example, the nonlinearity of the constraints and 
the locations of the starting points. For industrial applications, the optimization must 
be a stable algorithm in which a design is optimized for real world conditions and not 
just for one particular set of idealized nominal conditions. In real world situations, 
sometimes people do not know where to initiate an optimization. Thus, an RBDO 
algorithm should consistently deliver a promising optimum design under different 
circumstances (e.g., different starting points). Based on a review of the literature, this 
subject has received little attention. In light of this, this study proposes an alternative 
approach, in which the stability of the optimization algorithm is considered. The 
sensitivity of the proposed method to the starting point is examined and validated via 
  6
In a DO, the variabilities and uncertainties in RPs and random DVs are ignored. 
RPs/random DVs remain constant during optimization, and the constraint function is 
defined as Gi = (D, X, P) ≤ 0. In this case, the reliability of an optimal design is often 
low due to its failure to capture the variability/uncertainty in RPs/random DVs. Here, 
variability refers to randomness caused by the inherent property of the subjects of 
interest. Meanwhile, uncertainty refers to randomness caused by the lack of 
information on the subjects of interest. This study only considers variability in 
RPs/random DVs in an RBDO problem. 
Eqn 1 is a nested double-loop calculation. The outer loop conducts optimization, and 
the inner loop deals with probabilistic analysis. The computational cost for this 
double-loop procedure is prohibitive for most practical problems. As mentioned 
earlier, many researchers have proposed other algorithms to overcome this issue. This 
study proposes an approach that focuses on the stability and accuracy of the 
optimization algorithm. 
研究方法: 
The step-by-step procedure of the proposed approach is as follows. 
1. The values of the auxiliary design points for given starting DVs (-problem) are 
determined. 
2. The RBDO problem is reformulated into a DO problem (-problem) by replacing 
the RPs with the auxiliary design points determined in Step 1. 
3. The revised DO problem (-problem) formulated in Step 2 is solved. 
4. The values of the auxiliary design points with the DVs obtained in Step 3 
(-problem) are determined. 
5. Steps 2 through 4 are repeated until the calculated auxiliary design points in Step 4 
converge. 
6. An RA for the converged optimal design point is performed to ensure that the 
required probabilistic constraints are satisfied 
A cantilevered beam is used here to illustrate the solution procedure of the proposed 
approach. The optimization target in this problem is to find the minimum volume of 
the beam; the constraint is that the maximum stress (in Eqn 2) in the structure must 
be less than the yielding stress, and the probability of constraint satisfaction should be 
larger than 0.99. The structure is shown in Figure 1. The width and depth of the beam 
(i.e., b and h) are DVs ranging from 2 cm to 10 cm. The loading (P, ton) at the end of 
the beam is a RP with N (0.5, 0.052). Another RP is the allowable yielding stress (fy, 
ton/cm2), with a distribution of N (2.5, 0.252). The length of the beam (L) is 100 cm. 
The mathematical formulation of this example is given as follows.

search paths. In the example problem of a cantilevered beam, if the second auxiliary 
design point is chosen as P=1.645 tons and fy=-1.645 tons/cm2 (in reduced space), 
which is x5 in Figure 2, then three loops are needed to obtain a converged RBDO 
design.  
Figure 3 shows the complete process when x5 is used. Note that the x5 in Figure 2 is 
the same as x1 in Figure 3. The line of g1 represents the location of the probabilistic 
constraint (limit state function) at the optimal point that is derived by using the mean 
values to designate the auxiliary design point (denoted as x0). Similarly, g2 and g3 
represent the locations of the limit state functions at the optimal points when using x1 
and x2 as the auxiliary design points. Here, xj and gj represent the auxiliary design 
point and the location of the probabilistic constraint in the jth loop, respectively. Note 
that the MPP obtained from the IRA is located on the converged limit state function 
(g3). Its value is (1.3521, -1.8931), which is different than the converged auxiliary 
design point (x3, i.e., 1.664, -1.6708).  
Figure 4 shows another RBDO process using x4 (2.645, -0.645) in Figure 2 as the 
second auxiliary design point (x1 in Figure 4). Five loops are needed in this case. 
Again, x5 (2.832, -0.836) is not equal to the MPP (1.3521, -1.8931) but has the 
capability of creating an optimal design with a satisfactory reliability. Note that x5 is 
also not equal to x3 (1.664, -1.6708), the point obtained in the previous trial. This 
shows that the MPP is not the only deterministic number that can produce an optimal 
design corresponding to the target reliability for a DO problem. In fact, there are 
many other design points that can also produce a satisfied design as demonstrated.  
Three things are evident from Figures 3 and 4. The first is that the auxiliary design 
points and the locations of probabilistic constraints always occur in pairs, denoted as 
(xi, gi), in the optimization process. To be specific, gi results from using xi-1 in a 
revised DO problem (-problem).  
The second observation is that the search for an optimal design of an RBDO problem 
may be considered as the search for a converged pair of (xi, gi). Once the converged 
probabilistic constraint position (or the converged auxiliary design point) is found, the 
answer to an RBDO problem is solved. Thus, this study proposes a method to solve 
an RBDO problem via a search for a converged auxiliary design point. The problem 
of searching for auxiliary design points with given DVs is named as the -problem 
here. The details of solving a -problem are described in the following section. 
The third observation is that all potential points (x1 – x9) can be used as auxiliary 
design points. That is, there are a variety of choices for the auxiliary design point, and 
this may prevent the solution from becoming trapped at the local optimal point.

Note that the current reliability depends on D and SP. That is, given different values 
of D or SP, the calculated auxiliary design points are different. Thus, one needs to use 
an iterative process (usually, several loops are needed) to find the converged 
reliability/auxiliary design points. Further details are given in the following section. 
 
2. Geometric interpretation of the auxiliary design points 
Figure 5 depicts the iteration process for determining auxiliary design points by using 
a geometric demonstration. For simplicity, but without sacrificing generality, an 
RBDO problem with one RP is considered here. Note that Figure 5 is plotted in RP 
space. The mean value of the actual RP (denoted as × in Figure 5(a)) is chosen to be 
the first auxiliary design point (x0, denoted as □ in Figure 5(a)). With this choice, the 
first location of the limit state function (g1) passes through the position of the mean 
value of the actual RP denoted as | in Figure 5(a). As mentioned earlier, an RBDO 
problem can be considered as a search process that finds the locations of the required 
probabilistic constraints. Also, the auxiliary design points and the locations of the 
probabilistic constraints are found in pairs. Thus, if g1 in Figure 5(a) is the desired 
limit state function, there must exist a RP for which the failure probability (denoted as 
Pf in Figure 5(b)) is equal to the target value. Such a RP is called the pseudo-RP and is 
plotted in blue in Figure 5(b). Apparently, the first pseudo-RP does not stay at the 
same location as that of the actual RP. This is confirmed by using Eqn 6 to calculate c1, 
as indicated in Figure 5(c), and it is not equal to zero. Based on Eqn 5, the second 
auxiliary design point, x1, can be calculated, and it is also displayed in Figure 5(c). By 
using x1, one can solve the -problem to obtain the location of the second limit state 
function (g2) shown in Figure 5(c). Similarly, assuming g2 is the desired limit state 
function, one can solve the -problem to find the location of sp2 shown in Figure 5(d). 
Here, sp2 denotes the mean value of the pseudo-RP in the second loop. Using sp2 and 
Eqn 6, one can compute the value of c2 as indicated in Figure 5(d). If c2 is not equal to 
zero, as displayed in Figure 5(d), one should use Eqn 5 to obtain the third auxiliary 
design point (x2) until ci converges to zero.

estimation of the reliability of a given design. 
The results of Case 2 for the proposed algorithm and the double-loop approach are 
shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. The reliability analysis used in Case 2 was 
the same as in Case 1 (FOSM). It is known that the limit state function of Case 2 is 
nonlinear for all three RPs. In such a situation, FOSM may not be able to provide an 
accurate reliability evaluation. For this reason, the deviation of the optimal designs 
among the different sub-cases was much bigger than that in Case 1. Some of them 
(sub-cases a – d) even provided a better optimum design point compared to the one 
obtained from the double-loop approach. However, sub-cases with only one RP 
(sub-cases e, f and g) did not consistently provide a promising result. Two out of three 
failed to find the optimal point. Hence, one should carefully choose the reduced 
number of auxiliary design points. 
Based on results of the first example, a simulation-based algorithm may be a better 
tool for reliability evaluations if the limit states are nonlinear. Also, to ensure that the 
proposed approach can consistently provide an optimal design, the number of RPs 
analyzed in the 　-problem is equal to the number of RPs in the following examples. 
 
(2) a 25-bar spatial truss  
This example was adopted from the study of Kaveh and Talatahari (2009, 2009). The 
variability in design parameters, including RPs and DVs, is not considered in their 
study. Here, three optimizations (Case 1 – Case 3) were performed for this 25-bar 
spatial truss. The structure of the truss is displayed in Figure 7. The three cases were 
DO, DO with factored loadings and RBDO. In DO (Case 1), the design target was to 
find the minimum weight of the structure when subjected to two deterministic loading 
combinations as indicated in Table 6. The structural members of this truss were 
arranged into eight groups, and all of the members in a group shared the same 
material and cross-sectional properties. Table 7 defines each group and their 
corresponding end nodes, respectively. The elasticity modulus of this structure was 
68,971 MPa (10,000 ksi). Displacement limitations of ±8.89 mm (±0.35 in.) were 
imposed on each node in three translational directions. The axial stress constraints 
varied for each group as shown in Table 8. The mathematical formulation of the DO is 
described as follows.

in which W is the total weight of the truss structure;  is the material density 
(2767.990 kg/m3 or 0.1 lb/in3); Li is the length of the ith truss member, which is a 
  14
approach. This is because in Case 2, each loading was multiplied by a uniform factor 
(1.88). Therefore, each loading (11 of them, including both loading combinations) 
played an identical role in the design process, which is not true in most cases. The 
factor used for each loading in Case 3 was calculated by dividing the auxiliary design 
points by their corresponding mean values, as indicated in Table 11. The results show 
that the assumption of a uniform factor (Case 2) was not realistic and loading number 
3 played the most important role in the design process.  
Note that in our proposed method, the RBDO is conducted by a sequence of 
calculations of the - and -problems. Although we do not perform the traditional 
double-loop RBDO here, the results of the proposed approach (Case 3) are very 
promising compared to the methodology engineers often use (Case 2). 
(3) a mathematical problem with multiple limit states   
A classical problem in RBDO literature aims to find the optimal mean of random DVs, 
and it was adopted here to demonstrate our proposed RBDO algorithm, especially for 
the consideration of the stability of the RBDO algorithm. This problem was analyzed 
by Youn and Choi (2004), Yang and Gu (2004) and Cheng et al. (2006). The 
optimization problem has the following mathematical description:

The DVs (D) are the mean values of the random DVs (X). For the current study, the 
random DV had a normal probability distribution with a standard deviation of 0.3. 
The target reliability was 99.87% for all three constraints. Note that each probabilistic 
constraint must satisfy the target reliabilities. 
The optimal designs are described in Table 12. Table 12 also displays the results from 
existing approximate RBDO approaches, such as the double-loop approach, the 
sequential approximate programming method (Cheng et al. 2006) and the single loop 
single variable approach (SLSV, Chen et al. 1997). The proposed approach did not 
deliver the minimum value of the objective function among the four approaches. 
However, the maximum difference between the literature and this study is only 0.12%. 
Thus, it is reasonable to claim that the proposed method is able to provide an accurate 
result.  
To further examine the capability of the proposed RBDO algorithm to deliver an 
  16
solution with a higher SOV compared to optimizations started from a feasible domain. 
However, the trend is not as obvious as in the case of 　. 
From Figures 8 – Figure 11, it is clear that implementation of the proposed algorithm 
to solve an RBDO problem is fairly robust with respect to starting points. This is in 
contrast to the traditional double-loop approach for which the starting point can have 
a more dramatic effect on the optimization results. In addition, in this example, the 
limit state functions are highly nonlinear. It is seen that the proposed algorithm is 
suitable for both linear and nonlinear RBDO problems 
(4) a mathematical problem of system reliability 
A mathematical problem that considers system reliability, in which the multiple 
nonlinear constraints are non-monotonic functions, was used to investigate the 
accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Optimization results obtained from 
different algorithms were compared via a performance measure, as defined later in the 
manuscript. The optimization problem is described by Eqn 14.

where, D is a vector of DVs, and P is a vector of RP. The vector P had a normal 
probability distribution with a mean value of 4 and a cov of 0.25. The target system 
reliability was 95%. 
This problem was solved by three different methods: the double-loop approach using 
FOSM for reliability analysis (Approach A), the double-loop approach with a 
simulation-based reliability analysis (Approach B) and the proposed algorithm with a 
simulation-based reliability analysis (Approach C, the proposed method). In Approach 
A, system reliability was determined by averaging the Ditlevsen’s first-order upper 
and lower bounds. The simulation-based reliability analysis used in Approaches B and 
C was the radial-based importance sampling (RBIS) method with a sample size of 105. 
The reliabilities of three optimum points found by each method were evaluated by 
MCS with a sample size of 108. 
Because the constraints in this example were highly nonlinear, it was expected that 
Approach A may not be able to provide a design that satisfied the probabilistic 
requirements or have the capability of finding the "true" optimum design. Thus, a 
comprehensive comparison in terms of accuracy and stability was only investigated 
between Approaches B and C. A performance measure (T) for an RBDO algorithm 
  18
functions for each case are shown in Figure 12. It is evident that the initial design is 
far away from the constraint boundary, and as a result, its failure probability is as low 
as 0.0061 (Table 16). For Case 4, as shown in Table 16, the optimal point was feasible. 
However, the design was trapped in a local optimum, thus the value of its objective 
function was much larger than other feasible designs. Figure 12 also confirms this 
observation. The distance from the optimal design to the constraints for Case 4 
compared to those of other feasible designs (Case 5 and Case 6) was a little too far. 
The proposed algorithm solves the RBDO problem by searching a set of converged 
auxiliary design points, in which the locations of the limit state functions are 
implicitly designated. That is, the proposed algorithm stops when the locations of 
limit state functions converge. The convergence of the constraints is shown to be more 
accurate and robust than the convergence of a single design point, which is adopted in 
the traditional double-loop approach. In addition, in this example, the limit state 
functions were highly nonlinear. It is seen that the proposed algorithm is suitable for 
both linear and nonlinear RBDO problems 
(5) an engine connecting rod 
1. Background 
A one-cylinder engine has four basic parts: cylinder, piston, connecting rod and 
crankshaft. The cylinder, a tall metal can, is closed at one end. The piston, inside the 
cylinder, is a movable metal plug. The connecting rod, analyzed in this example, 
connects the reciprocating piston and the rotating crankshaft, transmitting axial 
compressive and tensile loads during the combustion and the suction cycles of the 
exhaust stroke, respectively. The dynamic behavior of the connecting rod is 
complicated and to model of it would not be an easy task. To focus on the 
demonstration of the stability of the proposed RBDO algorithm, an idealized model of 
a connecting rod, in which the momentum and gravity are ignored, was used in this 
example.  
The finite element model of the connecting rod considered here is shown in Figure 13. 
This ABAQUS model has 420 solid elements (C3D8R). Each element has eight nodes. 
For each node, three translational degrees of freedom were considered. The hole of 
the piston pin (right hole in Figure 13), which connects to the piston, was fixed to 
eliminate rigid body motion. The material properties were considered as follows. The 
Young’s modulus was 1 x 104 MPa, the Poisson's ratio was 0.3, the allowable Von 
Mises stress limit was 5 x 104 MPa.  
Analyses used in computer aided engineering (CAE) often require considerable 
simulation times, making the use of full analyses for iterative design optimization 
computationally prohibitive, particularly when reliability assessments are involved. 
Taking Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) as an example, it usually requires thousands or 
  20
for constructing an RS. A gradient-based optimizer from the MATLAB toolbox was 
used to perform the 　- and 　-problem and completed the RBDO task. Note that in 
solving 　-problem, one needs to acquire the reliability of a design which was 
executed by calling NESSUS, a general-purpose probabilistic analysis program 
developed by southwest research institute. Details of this procedure are displayed in 
Figure 14. As one can see that, for this particular industrial application, several 
software were used to accomplish the optimization. This is the usual way for practical 
engineers to finish their tasks. Thus, the proposed method is applicable to the 
industrial problem. 
3. Statement of problem 
The design objective was to minimize the volume of the connecting rod subjected to 
constraints on the Von Mises stress, with 95% reliability. The mathematical 
description of this problem is given in Equation 17.

The DVs (D) were the mean values of the random DVs (X), and their corresponding 
ranges are given in Table 17. The random DVs (X) consisted of the eight variables 
shown in Figure 15. The cov of X were 0.05 as shown in Table 18. The RP (P) was 
the pressure with a mean value of 1.8 x 103 MPa and a cov of 0.2 (Table 18), applying 
at the inside of the left hole, with an angle varying from 0° to 180°. The max stands for 
the maximum stress among all elements. The value of a was 5 x 104 MPa. The target 
reliability was 95%. 
4. Results 
For example 2, only a single starting point was used to evaluate the accuracy and 
stability of different algorithms. In this example, the accuracy and stability of 
different optimization algorithms were compared with results from different starting 
points, as described in the following manuscript. 
Two RBDO algorithms, the double-loop approach and the proposed approach, were 
used to solve this problem. The results of two approaches are provided in Table 19. 
Comparing with the design domain (Table 17), it is found that D4 and D7 are the only 
"interior optima". Note that Table 19 gives the results from performing the RBDOs 
with a single starting point. It is of interest to investigate the accuracy and stability of 
the two RBDO algorithms for different starting points. For this reason, 441 starting 
points were created, for which 21 different values of D4 and D7 were assigned and the 
rest of the DVs remained constant. The values of D4 and D7 were equally divided 
between -6 – 12 and 22 – 37, respectively. A performance measure () with respect to 
  22
MPa (from 4.577 x 104 MPa) in the RBDO design. The RBDO design tended to 
increase the size of the rod, especially in the area near the crankshaft hole. This result 
is reasonable because this is an area that resists the loading and transmits it to the rest 
of the connecting rod. Also, the RBDO design tended to reduce the volume of both 
the crankshaft and the pinhole. This RBDO solution possessed a smaller volume 
compared to the initial design but with a better reliability.

結論: 
This study proposes a new approach to solve the RBDO problem and compares it with 
the traditional double-loop RBDO approach, emphasizing the accuracy and stability 
of the approach. The proposed RBDO algorithm utilizes the concept of decomposing 
technique to solve an RBDO problem via a sequence of solving - and - problems. 
The key point is the search for the auxiliary design point, which forces the optimal 
design to the boundary of the probabilistic constraints. Several important conclusions 
are drawn from the results, and they are described as follows: 
1. By decomposing an RBDO, an RBDO is solved sequentially, which is easier for 
engineers. Also, there is more than one value for each RP to decompose the RBDO. 
This prevents the solution from becoming trapped in the local optima. 
2. The number of RPs used in solving an RBDO can be less than the number stated in 
a problem. This provides a chance to reduce the computational cost and, also, to 
simplify the solution procedure.  
3. Besides finding a better stress distribution of a structure compared to that of a DO, 
the proposed method further provides a way to calculate the weight factor for each 
RP. 
4. The proposed method is accurate and stable for problems with nonlinear constraints, 
and system reliability due to the lack of need for simplification or linearization is 
assumed. 
5. For linear problems, the reliability index is suitable as a measurement of the 
reliability performance for a given design. For nonlinear problems, however, it is 
suggested that the probability of failure/success be used as a measurement of
