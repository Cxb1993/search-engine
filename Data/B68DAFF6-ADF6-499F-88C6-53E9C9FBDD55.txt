 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The experimental setup is shown in Fig 2, a beam from He-Ne laser with wavelength of 632.8nm is incident into 
an isolator, a beam expander, and a polarizer (P(0°)). The isolator is used to prevent the light from the optical 
system back into the laser. To use the polarizer (P(0°)) is to acquire the P-polarized beam. Then the beam passing 
through a quarter-waveplate twice, the polarization of the beam reflected from a specimen is changed to 
S-polarized light, and then it is reflected by the polarized beam-splitter (PBS) and is incident into an angular 
sensor (a parallelogram prism with refractive index of 1.51509) at the critical angle nearby. The sensor 
transforms the deflection angle (due to the gradient of test surface) into the reflectance. The purpose for using 
S-polarized light to be incident into the sensor is that the reflectance slope of S-polarization is more identical 
than P-polarization’s. It is convenient to calculate the slope of reflectance. The lens configuration of Objective 2 
and Lens3 is an optical imaging system, and CCD is located at the imaging plane for catching the 3D surface 
profile. We used two incident angles of the sensor, the critical angle and the total internal reflection angle, to 
measure and obtain the reflectance profile. The reflectance profile measurement can be

used to identify our results. The experimental results were shown in Fig.3, where Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c) were our 
results and Fig. 3(d) was the result from AFM. Fig.3(a) is total 3D pattern of a test area of 400×300(μm2), Fig.

part of Fig. 3(a) for comparing with AFM’s result. The average roughnesses from the results of ours and ATM’s 
were 6 and 10 nm, respectively. The root-mean-square roughnesses from the results of ours and AFM’s were 7 
and 13 nm, respectively. They were very close to each other. If we let the results from AFM be a standard, the 
difference between them may be looked like as the system error. In another case, a grating with 20lines/mm 
grooves was tested. Three- and two-dimensional profiles are shown in Fig 4 (a) and (b). These results are very 
close to the 2D result from the surface profiler Dektak-6M which is shown in Fig.4.

ABSTRACT 
Transmission-type laser scanning angle deviation microscopy (TADM) with NA=0.65 for three dimension (3D) 
measurement is presented. It is based on the theorems of geometrical angular deviation and surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) and the use of the common-path heterodyne interferometry. When a laser beam defocuses on the surface of a 
transparent sample, the transmission light will be deviated a small angle from the optical axis and the deviation angle is 
proportional to the defocus length and the square of the numerical aperture. We used a SPR angular sensor and the 
common-path heterodyne interferometry to measure this deviation angle. Scanning the sample, the phase profile was 
measured and transferred to surface height pattern, the 3D surface profile was obtained in real-time. The results showed 
that the dynamic range and lateral and axial resolutions were equal to ±5.6 μm, 0.3 μm, and 3 nm, respectively. 
Keywords: angle deviation microscopy (ADM), heterodyne interferometry, surface plasmon resonance, 3D 
measurement 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Optical microscopy enables examination of intact samples and living cells in real time better than other microscopy 
methods (e.g., electron microscopy). In recent years, optical microscopy for both two-dimensional (2D) and three 
dimensional (3D) measurements became available. 2D profile methods include techniques such as NSOM [1–3], TIRFM 
[4], and SPR [5–6]. 3D profile methods include conventional (e.g., multiphoton [7–8], reversible saturation [9], 
interference [10–12], deconvolution [13]), confocal [12, 14], and angle deviation microscopy [15–16]. In conventional 
optical microscopes, the lateral resolution is generally determined by the Rayleigh criterion. Thus, it is limited and 
depends on the numerical aperture (NA) value, wavelength, and resolution of the detector. The axial resolution could be 
in the region from several microns to nanometers. In 2007, we proposed angle deviation microscopy (ADM) [15] to 
measure a reflective sample, and in 2008, a transmission type of ADM with NA=0.4 [16] was born with improved lateral 
and axial resolutions. To enhance its lateral and axial resolutions continuously, we increased the NA value of the 
objective lens and used a Zeeman laser as a light source to decrease noise due to low-frequency interference. 
Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of this method. 
 
2. PRINCIPLES: 
A parallel beam is incident into a confocal system. The output beam is also parallel. If a transparent specimen is inserted 
between the two objective lenses of the confocal system, the output beam will diverge or converge unless the system has 
been adjusted again. From Fig.1, when the focus point is inside (or outside) the test surface, the output beam diverges (or 
converges). The angle of divergence is written as

From Fig.2, the setup of TADM, the beam from the confocal system is incident into a SPR sensor at the resonant angle 
and then reflected to an analyzer (ANt). The resonant angle depends on the permittivities of the metal layer and air, and 
the refractive index of prism in the SPR sensor and is given as [17]

where 1n  is the refractive index of the prism, and m  and a  are the permittivities of metal and air, respectively. 
Because the sensor has high phase sensitivity at the resonant angle, selecting two marginal rays from the beam is the best 
approach, because these rays have the largest angular and phase sensitivities relative to others.  
The beam from a heterodyne light source with two orthogonal polarizations has a beat frequency. The phase difference 
between S- and P-polarizations from the output of the SPR sensor could be obtained by using common-path heterodyne 
interferometry [18]. After the SPR sensor, the transmission axis of an analyzer (ANt) is located between these two 
polarizations to acquire the interference signals. The two marginal rays have their own interference signals, which are 
converted to electrical signals by two photodetector elements (Dt). The signals are AC signals with the same beat 
frequency. Each phase of optical interference is transferred to the phase of each AC signal. By connecting two AC signals 
with a lock-in amplifier, the phase difference is measured. For symmetrical rays, the deviation angles of the two rays 
have the same value but opposite signs. If we name the phases of Ray A and Ray B A and B , the curve of the phase 
difference BAAB    versus the deviation angle is also symmetric, as shown in Fig.3. In the region of ±100 degrees 
of AB , the region of the deviation angle is ±80 arcsec. The slope of phase AB  is determined by the refractive indices 
of the prism, the metal, and the thickness of all the layers [17]. As mentioned above, the phase difference AB  is also 
proportional to the surface height. 
 
3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS 
The experimental setup is shown in Fig.2. A beam from a heterodyne light source (a Zeeman laser) with a wavelength of 
632.8 nm, a diameter of 4 mm, and a beat frequency of 2.7 MHz was incident into a beam splitter (BS). The reflected 
light from the BS was passed through an analyzer (ANr) whose transmission axis was at 45 relative to the x-axis and 
detected by a photodetector (Dr); the signal is a reference signal for system alignment calibration. The transmission beam 
from the BS was incident into a confocal system composed of two objective lenses. The test specimen, a plate with a 
ZnO layer and with periodical grooves, was located at the confocal plane. The beam passing through the specimen and 
two objective lenses was incident into a SPR sensor at the resonant angle. Then, surface plasmon resonance occurred and 
induced a large phase between the S- and P-polarizations. To make these two polarizations interfere, we used another 
analyzer (ANt) besides the SPR sensor to take out the partial component of polarizations to interfere. The transmission 
axis of analyzer ANt was tilted about 10 relative to the x-axis for higher visibility. We used two elements of a linear 
photodetector (Dt), which had several segments, to detect the interference of two marginal rays. We filtered and 
amplified these two AC signals and connected them to a lock-in amplifier to obtain the phase difference AB .  
Areas 5 μm × 5 μm were scanned with different NA values using a 3-axis translator in the x and y directions with each 
step of 1 and 0.1 μm, respectively. The phase difference BAAB    of every point was recorded using a personal 
computer (PC). The phase profile was converted to a 3D profile by using the PC to calculate the transfer function from 
phase to surface height. In the parameters of the SPR sensor, the permittivities of the prism, Au, and air are 251509.1 , 
-12+1.26i, and 20003.1 (F/m), respectively. The effective NA values of the lenses marked NA=0.25, 0.4, and 0.65 are 
0.12, 0.23, and 0.41, respectively. These values are smaller than those marked because we use a smaller beam size in the 
experiments. Dynamic range simulations of these real NA values for the same phase range of ±100 degrees were 
performed; the curves are shown in Fig.4. The curve of NA=0.41 has the largest phase slope, but the dynamic range 
( 6.5 μm) of measurement is the smallest. From Fig.5, the dynamic response of phase measurement showed that the 
standard deviation was about 0.059. Therefore, by substituting it into the equation of AB  versus   and Equation 
(1), we find that the surface height resolutions of NA=0.12, 0.23, and 0.41 were about 38, 10, and 3 nm, respectively. 
Their maximum dynamic ranges were about 76 , 20 , and 6.5 μm, respectively, without translating the sample in the 
z direction.
