Abstract 
An optically transparent p-NiO/i-ZnO nanorods/n-ZnO heterojunction device was been successfully 
constructed to be ultraviolet (UV) photodiodes by r.f. magnetron sputtering system. The ZnO nanorods 
with well-defined hexagonal facets (0 0 2) were grown almost vertically over the ZnO films. The 
current-voltage curves of p-i-n heterojunction devices exhibited a diode-like rectifying behavior. The 
forward threshold and reverse current for p-NiO/n-ZnO heterojunction are about 0.53V and 3.03x10-8 
A/cm2 at −1V, respectively. Introduction the ZnO nanorods as intrinsic layer, the forward threshold and 
reverse breakdown voltages obtained are 1.79V and 1.01 x10-9A/cm2 at −1V. The lower dark current and 
higher photosensitivity of p-NiO/i-ZnO nanorods/n-ZnO heterojunction device may attribute to the high 
surface to volume ratio of ZnO nanorods. The results indicate that such a structure is suitable for 
ultraviolet detection application.

1. Introduction 
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetector has drawn a great deal of interest in recent years, due to their potential 
application such as solar astronomy, missile plume detection, space-to-space transmission, fire alarm and 
combustion monitoring[1-2]. Currently, light detection in the UV spectral range still uses Si-based optical 
photodiodes. Although, Si-based photodiodes are sensitive to visible and infrared radiation, the 
responsivity in the UV region is low since the room temperature bandgap energy of Si is only of 1.2 eV. 
In recent years, much research has been focused on high performance solid state ultraviolet (UV) 
photodetectors [3].The ZnO thin film has been the subject of much research in recent years due to its 
varied potential applications for optoelectronic devices [4].The p–n junction is widely-adopted structures 
for UV photodetector [5]. Till now, besides seeking an effective method to prepare p-type ZnO, another

arrays. The inset shows the XRD pattern of the NiO thin films deposition on glass substrates. The 
diffraction peaks were identified and compared with those of the standard two theta peaks of a JCPDS 
card (Bunsenite, NaCl-type structure, 2003 JCPDS database No: 89-7130).It can be seen that the film is 
polycrystalline. Ryu et al. have observed that the development of preferred orientation in NiO film is 
primarily governed by surface energy [10].As growing NiO films in an oxygen rich environment, the (111) 
planes were well developed and beneficially reduced the total surface free energy. On the contrary, in an 
deficient oxygen ambiance, the (200) planes were developed and was unfavorable to decrease the surface 
energy[11]. Wei-Luen et al. claimed that NiO films with (111) preferred orientation has lower electrical 
resivity and well chemical stability[12].Hence the NiO films with predominantly (111) preferred 
orientation is beneficial for the heterojunction device in this study.  
 
The field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) image of ZnO nanorods was shown in the 
Fig.3. Large scale densely packed and vertically oriented ZnO nanorod arrays were grown on ZnO thin 
film through a simple hydrothermal synthesis process. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the cross section of ZnO 
nanorods. It can be seen that the ZnO nanorods with hexagonal structure were vertically aligned on the 
substrate. The average length of the nanorods is about 560nm with a density of 30 nanorods per μm2. 
 
Both I-V curves of p-NiO/n-ZnO and p-NiO/i-ZnO nanorods/n-ZnO heterojunction were shown in Fig. 
4. in comparison. It exhibited a rectifying, diode-like behavior. For p-NiO/n-ZnO heterojunction, the 
turn-on voltages are about 0.53V under forward bias. This value is smaller than the barrier potentials 
(0.7V) calculated from theoretical energy-band analysis using the energy gapes of ZnO(3.2eV) and 
NiO(4.0eV)[13]. The leakage current of p-NiO/n-ZnO and p-NiO/i-ZnO nanorods/n-ZnO heterojunction 
devices was 3.03x10-8A and 1.01x10-9A at −1V, respectively. The inset in Fig. 4 shows a straight line 
imply that the contacts between Al/NiO film and Al/ZnO film are all ohmic. This suggests that the 
rectifying behavior is dependent on p-n junction character. The built-in voltage under forward bias of the 
p-i-n heterojunction was larger than that of p-n heterojunction devices, due to the existence of the i-ZnO 
nanorods, which is because of the higher interface resistivity due to adding the mid-layer of intrinsic ZnO 
nanorods[14]. 
 
In order to verify the feasibility of p-NiO/i-ZnO nanorods/n-ZnO heterojunction is suitable to serve as a 
UV photodetector, the I–V measurements for this heterojunction were performed under illumination with 
a wavelength of 365 nm and 0.3mW/cm2. The results are shown in Fig. 5. When 3V bias was applied, it 
was found that the dark current was 7.65×10-9 A and the photocurrent was 9.95×10-6 A. It means that the 
photocurrent was much larger than the dark current in three orders. It is well known that the defects at the

Transparent electronics is an advanced technology concerning the realization of invisible electronic
circuits. The p-type doping in ZnO wide band gap semiconductor has been a challenge for research for
many years. In this work, Lithium-doped ZnO ﬁlms were deposited by the RF magnetron sputtering
method. The inﬂuence of post-annealing temperature on the electrical, structural and optical properties
of ZnO:Li ﬁlms were investigated. The results show that the ZnO:Li ﬁlms show (0 0 2) preferred
orientation and high average transmittance about 85% in the visible region after annealing temperature
of about 550 1C. The optimal p-type conduction of ZnO:Li ﬁlm is achieved at the post-annealing
temperature of 450 1C with a resistivity of 0.22 O cm, hole carrier concentration of 2.471018 cm3
and mobility of 0.22 cm2/V s. Finally, p–n homojunction based on transparent semiconducting oxides is
fabricated.

1. Introduction
In the past decades, researches on wide band gap semiconduc-
tors have led to the commercialization of photoelectric devices.
Zinc oxide is a wide band gap semiconductor material, which can
be used in gas sensors [1], solar cells [2], catalysts [3] and light-
emitting devices [4]. Because ZnO has a wide direct band gap of
3.3 eV, a large excitonic binding energy of 60 meV, and stability in
a hydrogen plasma atmosphere and its low price, there are many
reports on the applications of ZnO in ultraviolet light-emitting
diodes (LED) [5]. In general, for the development of optical devices
based on ZnO, it is necessary to obtain n- and p-type ZnO ﬁlms.
ZnO occurs naturally as n-type conduction due to its intrinsic
donor defects, such as zinc interstitials or oxygen vacancies.
However, due to the low solubility of the dopant and high self-
compensation, ZnO has difﬁculty in obtaining good, reproducible
p-type material [6]. The p-type ZnO is achieved by doping of
elements of group-I (Li, Na, K). The group-I species substituting for
Zn, such as LiZn, theoretically possess shallower acceptor levels.
However, interstitial group-I impurities (such as Lii) are likely to
be shallow donors, and their incorporation would have to be
suppressed to avoid self-compensation of the substitutional
acceptors [7–10]. In this study, we report the inﬂuence of post-
annealing temperature on the electrical, structural and optical
properties of ZnO:Li thin ﬁlms. To investigate the formation of the
p-type ZnO ﬁlms, the p–n homojunction structure of ZnO ﬁlms
was fabricated and the I–V characteristics were measured. Then,
the effect of post-annealing process on I–V characteristics of the
fabricated p–n transparent junctions was studied.
2. Experimental method
ZnO ﬁlms were deposited on Corning 1737 glass by RF magne-
tron sputtering using Zn target (99.99% purity) with several Li2CO3
(99.99% purity) piece meals on it. At high temperature, Li2CO3 can
be decomposed into Li2O [11,12]. The glass substrates were
cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with organic solvents and dried with
dry nitrogen before loading in the sputtering system. The deposi-
tion chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 103 Pa. The Ar
(99.995%) and O2 (99.99%) with the ratio of 10:1 (in volume) were
introduced as the sputtering gases at a total pressure of 1.33 Pa.
Before deposition, the target was pre-sputtered for 10 min to
remove possible contaminant on the surface. All samples were
analyzed in the same thickness of about 200 nm. The compositions
of the doped ZnO ﬁlms were determined by WDS and ICP-MS. We
dissolved the ZnO:Li sample in the aqua regia (HCl:HNO3, 3:1), and
then it was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectro-
metry (ICP-MS). The Li concentration obtained in this study was
7.4 at%. After deposition, the ﬁlms were annealed at various
substrate temperatures from 350 to 550 1C in Ar ambient for 3 h
with heating and cooling rates of 3 and 2 1C/min, respectively.
The crystalline structure of the ﬁlms was conﬁrmed by the
Glancing incident angle XRD (GIAXRD) using a CuKa radiation

larger [14]. The two theta value of ZnO:Li thin ﬁlms increases
with the increase in the annealing temperature up to 450 1C, and
then steeply decreases at 550 1C. These results indicate that the
lattice constants of ZnO crystals are gradually decreased as the
radius of Li+ (0.60 A˚) ions is smaller than that of Zn2+ (0.74 A˚),
and the substitution mechanism is executed.
Fig. 2 shows SEM morphology of ZnO:Li thin ﬁlms annealing at
450 1C for 3 h. It shows that the surface morphology of the
deposited ﬁlms has the smooth surface without any voids and
crack. Fig. 2(b) shows a cross sectional SEaM image of ZnO:Li thin
ﬁlms annealing at 450 1C for 3 h. The ﬁlms are vertically aligned
and grow along the (0 0 1) direction. The ZnO:Li ﬁlm has a
thickness of about 200 nm.
3.2. Electrical properties
Fig. 3 shows the Hall mobility and hole concentration of the
as-grown Li-doped ZnO ﬁlms and post-annealing at different
temperatures. The resistivity decreased with increasing annealing
temperature. When the annealing temperature increases to
450 1C, more Li atoms substitute for Zn, which act as an effective
acceptor, and thus the optimized p-type conduction is achieved.
The carrier concentration increased with increasing annealing
temperatures. This behavior could be ascribed to higher annealing
temperatures, and the atoms have enough activation energy to
occupy the proper sites in the crystal lattice. As the annealing
temperature further increases up to 550 1C, the ZnO:Li thin ﬁlms
conduction converts from p-type to n-type. Above 550 1C, the
carrier density of the ﬁlms increases and the mobility decreases
with the annealing temperature. With regard to the conversion of
the conducting type at a higher annealing temperature (550 1C), it
may be caused by the outdiffusion of Li impurities acceptors out
of the ZnO ﬁlms. It is the possible Lii or LiZn–Lii defects acting as
‘‘hole killer’’ and scattering center that reduce the hole concen-
tration and Hall mobility evidently [15], which act as an ineffec-
tive acceptor and thus the n-type conduction formed. In addition,
the outdiffusion of oxygen and/or segregation of zinc may also
occur at high annealing temperatures producing native defects
such as oxygen vacancy (VO), zinc interstitial (Zni), and zinc
antisite (ZnO), which are believed to act as donors [16]. Therefore,
we found that the optimal p-type conduction is achieved at the
annealing temperature of 450 1C with a resistivity of 0.22 O cm,
hole carrier concentration of 2.471018 cm3 and mobility of
0.22 cm2/V s.

the substitution of Li on Zn site, which may be the main reason of
p-type behavior of Lithium-doped ZnO ﬁlms.
3.4. I–V characteristics
To conﬁrm the p-type conductivity of ZnO:Li thin ﬁlms, the
ZnO-based p–n homojunction was fabricated by deposition of a
p-type ZnO:Li ﬁlm on an un-doped n-type ZnO ﬁlm on glass
substrate. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the
homojunction is shown in Fig. 5. The current increases non-
linearly with the forward bias, which indicates a p–n junction
characteristic behavior. The homojunction device exhibits typical
rectifying character of the diode. The forward threshold voltage is
0.6 V, and the reverse breakdown voltage is about 0.4 V. The
I–V characteristics of the Al/p-ZnO:Li ﬁlm contacts are shown in
inset of Fig. 5. It is linear, showing the electrode has Ohmic
contacts in nature. It is supposed that the Al electrode would
passivate the ZnO:Li ﬁlm, and likely contribute to the stability.
We have fabricated over 30 devices, and 90% of them showed
good rectifying behavior. Such behavior remained after the
devices were exposed to the atmosphere for more than two
months, indicating good device stability.
4. Conclusions
We have systematically studied the properties of ZnO:Li ﬁlms
in annealing processes, with temperatures ranged from 350 to
550 1C. The p-type conductivity of ZnO could be obtained under
appropriate annealing conditions. Only one peak corresponding to
ZnO (0 0 2) plane was observed for all the samples, and no
diffraction from other phases such as Li2O is detected, suggesting
good crystallinity with a high preferential c-axis orientation. The
ZnO ﬁlms show the increase in transmittance with annealing
temperature up to 550 1C to about 87% in the visible region. The
optimal p-type conduction is achieved at the annealing tempera-
ture of 450 1C with a resistivity of 0.22 O cm, hole carrier
concentration of 2.471018 cm3 and mobility of 0.22 cm2/V s.
A conversion from p-type conduction to n-type at annealing
temperature above 550 1C was also conﬁrmed by the Hall mea-
surement. Finally, I–V measurements conﬁrmed that the homo-
junction structure showed excellent rectiﬁcation behavior.

(λ = 0.15406 nm). The Zn K-edge (9659 eV) XAS spectra were
recorded on a wiggler C (BL-17C) beamline at the National
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) of Taiwan.
The XAS data analyses were performed using standard methods
and WinXAS software. The ﬁttings of the EXAFS were per-
formed using least-squared ﬁttings from outputs from FEFF8.0
software. General EXAFS data analysis has been described in
the literature.1719 The parameters calculated from the ﬁttings
were the interatomic distances, coordination numbers, and the
DebyeWaller factors. The resistivity and carrier concentrations
of the ZnO:Li thin ﬁlm at room temperature were measured by a
Hall-eﬀect measurement system (Lake Shore, model 7662) using
the van der Pauw method.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of ZnO thin ﬁlms with
diﬀerent Li-doping contents on glass substrates prepared by an rf
magnetron sputtering method. The compositions of the doped
ZnO ﬁlms were determined by both WDS and ICP-MS. The
O/Zn atomic ratios were obtained from WDS, and the Li/Zn
atomic ratios were measured by ICP-MS. The Li content in the
ﬁlms increased with an increasing number of Li2CO3 disks
mounted on the Zn target surface. The maximum Li content
obtained in this study was approximately 10 at. %. A similar
content has been reported by Wang.2022The solubility of Li in
single-crystal ZnO is very high, with up to around 30% of the Zn
sites being occupied by Li has been reported by Onodera et al.23
Only one peak corresponding to a (002) plane was observed for
all the samples, and no diﬀraction peaks reﬂected from other
crystalline phases was seen, suggesting good crystallinity with a
high preferential c-axis orientation and formation of LiZn in the
ﬁlms.With the Li-doped content increasing, the full width at half-
maximum (fwhm) became weak and broad, and the diﬀraction
angle shifted toward the high angle direction, as shown in
Figure 1b. It is known generally that dopants can be substituted
or inserted, depending on the doping ions' size. Yamamoto24 and
Onodera22 reported that most doping ions substituted for Zn ion
sites in the doping case due to a decrease in theMadelung energy.
If Liþ ions interstitial to Zn2þ ions, the lattice parameter of the
ZnO crystal increases and the (0 0 2) peak should shift to low
angle. In addition, Li at a substitutional site creates an energy
level at 0.09 eV. However, Li at an interstitial site creates an
energy level at 1.58 eV, and it is more stable, according to Park
et al. According to their result, the XRD peak shifts toward high
angle, which implies that the highly incorporated Liþ ions exist in
the substitutional sites, not in the interstitial sites.
The electrical resistivity values of ZnO:Li ﬁlms with diﬀerent
Li dopant contents can be seen in Figure 2. The Hall coeﬃcient
and hot probe measurements method were employed to identify
the type of conduction in these ﬁlms. The p-type conductivity
behavior could be achieved only in the Li content from 1 to 5 at. %.
As is well-known, in Li-doped ZnO specimens, Li doping mainly
occurs as follows25

where LiZn represents lithium on the zinc lattice site, Lii lithium
in an interstitial position, and Oo oxygen on the lattice site of
itself. Signiﬁcantly, LiZn is theoretically predicted to have a
shallow acceptor level.10 For the 1 at. % Li-doped ZnO ﬁlms,
weak p-type conduction was found to have high resistivity
and low carrier concentration due to the fact that holes may
be compensated for by n-type native defects. For the 3 at. %
Li-doped ZnO ﬁlm, more Li atoms substituted for Zn, which
acted as an eﬀective acceptor, thus achieving optimized p-type
conduction. By doping a I group impurity into the IIVI
semiconductor of ZnO, the impurity became the acceptor, and
the electrons decreased, thus transforming the ﬁlm from an
n-type to a p-type conductive behavior. In a certain amount of
doping, the electronic holes increased with doping Li concentra-
tions. The optimized doping amount obtained in this study is at
3 at. % Li-doped ZnO thin ﬁlms with 0.11 Ω 3 cm in electrical

length of RLiO in ZnO is 1.661 Å, and the RZnLi bond length
is 2.703 Å,28 which is much diﬀerent than the bond length of
RZnO, excluding the possibility that the interstitial mechanism
was executed. For the 3 at. % Li-doped ZnO ﬁlms, only the
coordination number and interatomic distance of the second
shell decreased, whereas that of the ﬁrst shell was similar to the
undoped ZnO thin ﬁlms. The second shell interatomic distance
RZnZn of 3 at. % Li-doped ZnO decreased from 3.270 to 3.211
Å, which implied a decreased lattice parameter for the Li-doped
ZnO ﬁlms. These results indicate that the substitution of Li
atoms for parts of Zn atoms in the ZnO lattice leads to a decrease
in the nearest-neighbor bond length between the Zn and Zn
atoms of Li-doped ZnO ﬁlms. For the second coordination shell,
it can be seen that the DebyeWaller factor (σ2) is larger for the
3 at. % Li-doped ZnO as compared with the undoped one. This
result is also consistent with the XRDmeasurement because local
structure distortions may occur as a consequence of a lattice
mismatch induced at a higher doping amount.
4. CONCLUSIONS
The XRD results indicated that all of the ZnO:Li ﬁlms had
(002) preferred orientations with hexagonal wurtzite structures.
The electrical measurements by hot probe and the Hall coeﬃ-
cient showed that the lithium-doped ZnO thin ﬁlms had a p-type
conductive behavior. The optimized doping amount obtained in
this study is at 3 at. % Li-doped ZnO thin ﬁlms with 0.11Ω 3 cm in
electrical resistivity, 0.22 cm2/V 3 s in Hall mobility, and 3.13 
1018 cm3 in carrier concentration. The XANES and EXAFS
analyses indicate that the Li substituted for Zn2þ without
changing the crystalline structure of ZnO. From the EXAFS
results, it indicates that decreases in the second shell of the
ZnZn coordination number are caused by incorporation of
lithium in the substitutional sites rather than in the interstitial
sites in p-type ZnO sputtering ﬁlm.

 Pa The r.f. power was set in the 200 Watts range, the ratio of oxygen to argon for the deposited ZnO 
and NiO films was set at 6% and 100%, respectively. Both all the thickness of films was controlled by 
sputtering time at approximate100nm.The XRD patterns of the films were determined with a 
Shimadzu XD-1 diffractometer using monochromatic high-intensity CuKa radiation (λ=1.51418Å ). 
The optical transmittance of the thin films was measured by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer 
measurements. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were measured by a HP 4156 
semiconductor parameter analyzer in both the darkness and illumination at 365 nm. 
Results and Discussion 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of ZnO and NiO thin films deposited on glass substrate by rf magnetron 
sputtering. The ZnO thin films corresponded to the wurtzite-type ZnO structure and only the (0 0 2) 
diffraction peak at about 34.41. The XRD spectrum of NiO films shows the film was polycrystalline 
with (111) and (222) orientations are observed in the pattern. Ryu et al. have observed that the 
development of preferred orientation in NiO film is primarily governed by surface energy [9].

The electrical parameters of p-NiO and n-ZnO were listed in Table 1. The nonstochiometric 
undoped ZnO films usually exhibit n-type conductivity due to the native donor such as oxygen 
vacancies and zinc interstitials. During n-ZnO deposition, the film was grown in an oxygen deficiency 
ambiance, which effectively increased the native donor, thus, resulting in high carrier concentration. 
The ZnO film has the lowest resistivity of 2.35x10-2ohm-cm, carrier concentration of 4.29×1019 cm-3 
and Hall mobility of 6.02cm2/V-sec.The electrical conductivity of NiO has a strong dependence on 
the formation of point defects, such as nickel vacancy or interstitial oxygen. [10-11]. Wei-Luen et al. 
claimed that the (111) orientation of NiO films deposited in an oxygen rich environment and the (200) 
orientation deposited in an oxygen deficiency ambiance [12].Compared with our data, the (111) 
preferred orientation were observed for the NiO films deposited in an oxygen-rich ambiance. The 
p-type NiO film has the lowest resistivity of 0.19 ohm-cm, carrier concentration of 7.52×1018 cm-3 and 
Hall mobility of 2.26cm2/V-sec.

 Another important figure of merit for photoconductive detectors is its photoresponse speed. Fig. 4 
shows measured photoresponse as a function of time as we switched the UV lamp (0.3 mW /cm2, 365 
nm) on and off. The 10–90% rise and fall time are 27.9 ms and 62.8 ms, respectively. The 
photo-generated holes oxidize the adsorbed negatively charged oxygen ions on the surface while the 
remaining electrons in the conduction band increase the conductivity. Thus, the photoresponse of 
oxide semiconductor including the adsorption and photodesorption of oxygen on the surface give rise 
to the very rapid change in conductivity that was caused by photogenerated hole–electron pairs and 
their extinction. The fall time is relatively long, but it is still much shorter than that had been reported 
on un-doped ZnO films.

Conclusion 
We have successfully fabricated a heterojunction of n-type ZnO and p-type NiO to demonstrate its 
applications in UV photodiodes. The XRD shows that ZnO films are highly crystalline in nature with 
preferred orientation along the (0 0 2) direction. The optical transmittances of ZnO and NiO films are 
87% and 80%, respectively. With 1V applied bias, it was found that dark current and photocurrent of 
our photodetector were 7.73x10−8 and 1.66x10-4 A/cm2, respectively. In other words, we achieved a 
ratio between photocurrent and dark current contrast about 3 orders of magnitude. It was also found 
that the corresponding time constant for turn-on transient was τon = 27.9 ms while that for turn-off 
transient was τoff= 62.8 ms.

 of 3.6–4.0eV at room temperature [8].It is known that nickel oxide (NiO) is an 
example of a material that is easily fabricated and is usually p-type semiconductor.  
In this paper, we report the fabrication and the properties of an optically 
transparent p-n heterojunction photodiode consisting of p-NiO and n-ZnO thin films. 
The structural and optical properties of the n-ZnO/p-NiO heterojunction were 
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–visible spectroscopy, Hall 
measurement, and I-V photocurrent measurements. 
 
2. Experiments 
The heterojunction having the structure of n-ZnO/p-NiO were fabricated by rf 
magnetron sputtering with a ZnO and NiO ceramics target of 99.99% purity. 
Ar(99.995%) and O2 (99.99%) were controlled by the electronic mass flow controller 
was introduced as the sputtering gases at a total pressure of 1.33 Pa The r.f. power 
was set in the 200 Watts range, the ratio of oxygen to argon for the deposited ZnO and 
NiO films was set at 6% and 100%, respectively. Both all the thickness of films was 
controlled by sputtering time at approximate100nm.The XRD patterns of the films 
were determined with a Shimadzu XD-1 diffractometer using monochromatic 
high-intensity CuKa radiation (λ=1.51418Å ). The optical transmittance of the thin 
films was measured by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer measurements. The 
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were measured by a HP 4156 
semiconductor parameter analyzer in both the darkness and illumination at 365 nm. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of ZnO and NiO thin films deposited on glass 
substrate by rf magnetron sputtering. The ZnO thin films corresponded to the 
wurtzite-type ZnO structure and only the (0 0 2) diffraction peak at about 34.41. The 
XRD spectrum of NiO films shows the film was polycrystalline with (111) and (222) 
orientations are observed in the pattern. Ryu et al. have observed that the development 
of preferred orientation in NiO film is primarily governed by surface energy [9].

In order to evaluate the feasibility of n-ZnO/p-NiO heterojunction as a UV 
photodetector, I–V measurements for this heterojunction were performed under 
illumination with a wavelength of 365 nm and 0.3mW/cm2, and the results shown in 
Fig. 3. The curve shows nonlinear and rectifying I-V characteristics, confirming the 
proper formation of the p-n junction. The lowest of leakage current is 7.73x10−8 
A/cm2 for n-ZnO/p-NiO heterojunction device. Moreover, the leakage current level 
was very low up to 2 V under the reverse bias. However, during I–V measurements, 
no luminescence was observed under the forward bias because of the high density of 
interface traps between n-ZnO and p-NiO film [14]. Furthermore, photocurrent to 
dark current contrast ratios for n-ZnO/p-NiO heterojunction can be determined from 
the measured dark currents and photocurrents. With 1V applied reverse bias, it was 
found that photocurrent to dark current contrast ratios of the n-ZnO/p-NiO 
heterojunction device was 3 orders. A low current contrast ratio is possibly due to 
imperfection of the heterojunction interface traps between ZnO and NiO films, which 
provide current tunneling paths under reverse current.

UV illumination. 
 
Another important figure of merit for photoconductive detectors is its 
photoresponse speed. Fig. 5 shows measured photoresponse as a function of time as 
we switched the UV lamp (0.3 mW /cm2, 365 nm) on and off. The 10–90% rise and 
fall time are 27.9 ms and 62.8 ms, respectively. The photo-generated holes oxidize the 
adsorbed negatively charged oxygen ions on the surface while the remaining electrons 
in the conduction band increase the conductivity. Thus, the photoresponse of oxide 
semiconductor including the adsorption and photodesorption of oxygen on the surface 
give rise to the very rapid change in conductivity that was caused by photogenerated 
hole–electron pairs and their extinction. The fall time is relatively long, but it is still 
much shorter than that had been reported on un-doped ZnO films

Transparent p–n heterojunction diodes consisting of n-type ZnO and p-type NiO 
thin films on glass substrates by r.f. magnetron sputtering. The structural and 
optical properties of the n-ZnO/p-NiO heterojunction were characterized by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), UV–visible spectroscopy, Hall measurement, and I-V 
photocurrent measurements. 
The XRD shows that ZnO films are highly crystalline in nature with preferred 
orientation along the (0 0 2) orientation. The optical transmittances of ZnO and 
NiO films are 87% and 80%, respectively. The current–voltage curve of the 
heterojunction demonstrates obvious rectifying diode behavior in a dark 
environment. The lowest of leakage current is 7.73x10− A/cm2 for n-ZnO/p-NiO 
heterojunction diode. Upon UV irradiation, it was found that the detector current 
was increased by more than one order of magnitude. It was also found that the 
corresponding time constant for turn-on transient was τon = 27.9 ms while that 
for turn-off transient was τoff= 62.8 ms.Transparent and thin film circuit is 
a future trend in the electronic field.The UV dector is important for us to avoid 
exporing under the sunlight too much.The heterojunction made by transparent is 
new and worth lots further studies.From the result of the project,this topic is 
valuable both in academic and industrial application.
