摘要  
本研究以脈衝直流磁控濺鍍法於矽晶片基材鍍製八種氮化鉻/氮化矽奈米多層薄膜，並藉
著改變試片於鉻/矽靶電漿區的停留時間來控制薄膜的雙層周期厚度。由實驗結果發現，八種
奈米多層薄膜都有極佳的週期規律性，具有 CrN單相結構與非晶質之 Si3N4相。當 CrN層與
a-Si3N4層的厚度比為 5:3時，薄膜機械性質達到最大值的雙層週期厚度臨界值為 10nm，其硬
度、彈性係數與破斷韌性分別達到 22GPa、303GPa與 2.3 MPa m。若是提高厚度比為 9:1時，
薄膜硬度可達 26.7GPa，不過其韌性卻大幅下降。然而由於純鉻中間層厚度達 200nm而生成
柱狀晶結構導致波浪狀界面，以及 CrN層與 a-Si3N4層的厚度太過接近，因此使得編號M1~M7
的 CrN/a-Si3N4奈米多層薄膜的強化效果有限。

Abstract 
Eight nanostructured CrN/amorphous-Si3N4 multilayer coatings were deposited periodically by 
the bipolar asymmetric pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering technique. Bilayer periods ranging 
from 5 nm to 40 nm were obtained successfully. It was observed that very good periodicity was 
found for each multilayered coating. The crystalline CrN and amorphous Si3N4 phase were found in 
each coating. The critical bilayer period of 10 nm was found to achieve an optimal 
hardness/toughness/adhesion combination including 22GPa in hardness, 303GPa in elastic modulus 
and 2.3 MPa m  in fracture toughness when the thickness ratio of CrN/Si3N4 reached 5:3. When the 
thickness ratio of CrN/Si3N4 reached 9:1, a higher hardness, 26.7 GPa and a lower fracture 
toughness were achieved. It is suggested that the 200nm thick Cr interlayer and close CrN/Si3N4 
layer thickness ratio are possible reasons for the low hardening effect of the number M1~M7 
CrN/amorphous-Si3N4 multilayer coatings in this work. 
Keywords: Nanostructured multilayer coatings, pulsed DC magnetron sputtering, bilayer period,

1.前言 
奈米薄膜可應用於機械工業、航太工業、模具工業、半導體工業、光電產業等等，可做
為切削刀具與精密模具表面改質材料、過濾器材料、微機電感測器材料、高密度磁記錄材料、
光敏材料、光電材料、平面顯示器材料、超導材料等等。其應用範圍極為廣泛、對於相關業
界的核心技術提升有極大的影響力。  
依據 Matthews 之報導[1]，目前硬質薄膜的研究與應用以超晶格薄膜(Superlattice thin 
film，亦稱為奈米多層薄膜 nano scale multilayer thin film) [2,3] 與奈米複合薄膜(nano 
composite thin film)[4,5]兩種薄膜材料為主。奈米多層薄膜是利用物理氣相沉積、化學氣相沉
積、電鍍法或化學法在材料表面披覆數層至數百層不同材質的薄膜，而單層薄膜厚度為數奈
米至上百奈米，奈米多層薄膜的總厚度可達到數百奈米至數微米的等級。由於奈米多層薄膜
的晶界總面積非常大，造成晶粒細化強化的效果非常優異，因此奈米多層薄膜材料的強度極
高、耐磨耗性極佳。 
 
2.文獻探討 
奈米多層薄膜可以分成相同結晶結構 (isostructural)多層薄膜與相異結晶結構
(non-isostructural)多層薄膜兩大類[6]，前者是指各薄膜具有相同的結構，因此通常都具有相同
 4
根據實驗證明，目前僅(1)差排之鏡像力(image force)與(2)Hall-Petch晶粒細化強化理論對多層
薄膜強化有直接之影響力，另外兩個強化機制的效果則非常微不足道[6]。 
 
2.4奈米多層薄膜之韌性提升機制 
根據Zhang等人的研究[24]，奈米多層薄膜的韌性提升機制可以用圖1表示，第一種為「裂
縫偏折機制」，由於裂縫自多層薄膜表面向內延伸過程會遇到延展性與脆硬性兩種薄膜組合，
最後會被延展性薄膜所偏折阻擋。第二種則為「裂縫連接機制」，延展性薄膜會像繃帶一般將
裂縫連接。第三種機制則是由於薄膜界面之奈米塑性而使裂縫尖端鈍化，因而阻撓裂縫繼續
延伸的破壞行為。 
 
3.研究目的 
自從 1987年 Helmersson等人發表[7]硬度可高達 50 GPa 的 TiN基質奈米多層薄膜之後，
有關高硬度、高韌性與極佳耐磨特性的奈米多層薄膜的研究已愈來愈受到重視。由於氮化鉻
薄膜具有優異的機械性質與良好的耐腐蝕特性，因而廣泛的受到工業界與學術界的重視與應
用[25,26]，於氮化鉻薄膜當中添加矽所形成的 Cr-Si-N 奈米複合薄膜具有更優異的機械性質
[22, 27,28]，有關氮化鉻/非晶質氮化矽的奈米多層薄膜的研究就相對較少[21,22,28]，而雙層
周期厚度(Λ)對此奈米多層薄膜系統的韌性影響性則尚未有相關文獻進行探討。 
本論文將針對氮化鉻/非晶質氮化矽的奈米多層薄膜進行研究，改變試片於鉻/矽靶電漿區
的停留時間，以獲得七種不同雙層周期厚度的多層薄膜，並探討雙層周期厚度對於奈米多層
薄膜的晶相、微結構與機械性質的影響。 
 
4.實驗步驟 
本實驗採用脈衝直流磁控濺鍍法於P型(100)單晶矽晶片與熱處理硬化至HRC52且拋光之
SKD61模具鋼表面鍍製氮化鉻/氮化矽奈米多層薄膜。此濺鍍系統具有兩個直流電源供應器，
並與一具脈衝產生器(SPIK 2000A, Shen Chang Electric Co., Taiwan)並聯，以分別供應3吋的鉻
靶與矽靶(純度均為99.99%)電源。靶材脈衝頻率20 kHz，具有100%反向電壓和80%的負荷週
期。基材並另外施以-200V之脈衝偏壓，此脈衝產生器(Sparc-le V, Advanced Energies Industries, 
USA)之頻率為50kHz，具有15%反向電壓和60%負荷週期。鍍製時試片置於腔體中央，鉻靶
與矽靶分別置於腔體左右兩側，藉著控制試片在鉻靶或矽靶之前電漿區停留時間來濺鍍不同
周期厚度(Λ)之奈米多層薄膜試片，濺鍍製程參數列於表1。其中鍍製編號M1~M7薄膜的Cr/Si
靶都使用相同(200W)的功率；為了改變氮化鉻/非晶質氮化矽的雙層薄膜厚度比例，鍍製T3
薄膜的Cr/Si靶則分別使用300W與30W的功率。 
本 實 驗 所 沉 積 之 氮 化 鉻 / 氮 化 矽 奈 米 多 層 薄 膜 使 用 場 發 射 電 子 微 探 儀
(FE-EPMA,JXA-8500F, JEOL, Japan)做成分分析。薄膜截面形態使用場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡
及場發射穿透式電子顯微鏡觀察，薄膜表面以原子力顯微鏡測量其表面粗糙度。本研究並使
用X光繞射儀(XRD,Rigaku, DMAX-B,)進行晶相結構分析，並藉由小角度X光繞射之X光反射
(XRR)圖與下列公式[6]計算氮化鉻/氮化矽奈米多層薄膜之雙層周期厚度，Λ。式中的θ為繞射
角，m為波峰數，λ為X光波長(0.15405nm)，δ為X光在此薄膜的平均反射係數。 
sin2θ = (mλ/2Λ)2 + 2δ……………………………..…...(1) 
薄膜使用奈米壓痕儀(Triboscope, Hysitron, USA)測量薄膜之硬度與彈性係數，以刮痕是驗
 6
的厚度約為 7.1nm 厚，比例約為 5:3，雙層週期實際總厚度約為 19.4nm，與當初實驗規劃所
預期之 20nm誤差僅 3 %，並且與前述小角度 XRD之計算結果 19.22nm相近。 
 
5.2機械性質分析 
編號 M1~M7奈米多層薄膜的雙層週期厚度與硬度、彈性係數與破斷韌性之關係如圖 11
所示，可發現當薄膜雙層週期厚度為 10nm時(M3試片)，其硬度、彈性係數與破斷韌性均為
最大值，分別達到 22GPa、303GPa與 2.3 MPa m，而當雙層週期厚度小於或大於 10nm時，
薄膜的相關機械性質都呈現下降的趨勢，而 T3 薄膜的硬度、彈性係數與破斷韌性分別為
26.7GPa、281GPa與 1.38 MPa m，可發現將 CrN層與 Si3N4層的厚度比由 5:3縮小至 9:1時，
其硬度值增加了 21%，不過彈性係數與破斷韌性卻明顯下降。圖 12為編號M1~M7奈米多層
薄膜的雙層週期厚度與臨界刮痕附著荷重之關係圖，同樣的從圖中可以發現 M3 試片具有最
大的上臨界刮痕附著荷重(Lc2)，且其趨勢與圖 11者相同，而當雙層週期厚度小於或大於 10nm
時，其薄膜附著性質都呈現下降的趨勢。 
在 CrN/a-Si3N4多層薄膜[21]與 CVD 鍍製的奈米晶 TiN/SixN 多層薄膜系統[30]都有類似
的結果。根據報導[24,31]，多層薄膜的韌性可以藉著控制其雙層週期厚度、層數與各層厚度
比而有增強的效果，在本研究則發現，CrN層與 Si3N4層的厚度比為 5:3，雙層週期厚度 10nm
的薄膜具有最佳之韌性。 
奈米多層薄膜的機械性質隨著雙層週期厚度降低而達到某一極大值，然後再下降的現象
是多層薄膜的典型特徵[7]，目前有數種理論來描述此一現象，包括 Koehler 強化機制 [32]、
Hall-Petch強化機制[33,34]、整合應力強化機制[35]與 Orowan強化機制[36]等。根據 Koehler
的研究 [32]，多層薄膜的強化是由於雙層材料的彈性係數差異所致，差排滑移可被雙層材料
之間的明確界面所阻擋，當Λ達到臨界值的時候，移動差排所需之應力為極大值。Hall-Petch
強化機制也有類似的關係式：薄膜硬度正比於 Λ-n [37]。然而，此關係式的Λ值最低限為 20-50 
nm [38].當晶粒尺寸小於此臨界值時，奈米材料的晶界滑動反而造成材料軟化，稱為反
Hall-Petch現象[39, 40]；在多層薄膜的反 Hall-Petch現象是由於鏡向力的相互抵銷[41] 以及差
排滑動過程的交互擴散所造成的界面粗糙化[42]。 
一般而言，除了 M1與 M2試片之外，其他多層薄膜的機械性質都優於純 CrN或是非晶
質 Si3N4者，而相較於 TiN/VN [7]或是 TiN/a-Si3N4[43,44]多層薄膜系統，本研究之 CrN/a-Si3N4
多層薄膜的強化效果非常有限，可能原因包括以下數點，首先是 CrN與 a-Si3N4的彈性係數差
異不大[21]，其次在 CrN層與 a-Si3N4層的界面晶格不匹配，無法產生 Cahn整合應變[45] 。
再者 Xu 等人[21] 亦認為 CrN 與 a-Si3N4的熱膨脹係數差異不大，因此不會產生較大熱應力
來強化多層薄膜。除此之外，CrN層與 a-Si3N4層的波浪狀界面，如圖 9(c)所示，亦會使強化
效果不彰。M1與 M2試片具有較大的粗糙度(如表 1 所列)，代表 CrN層與 a-Si3N4層之間的
波浪狀界面使得這兩個試片的強化效果變差，因此本研究之純鉻中間層厚度太厚所產生的波
浪狀界面是硬度不高的主因，而由 T3薄膜的高硬度亦可發現，當 CrN層與 a-Si3N4層的厚度
比太過接近(5:3)，也是硬度不高的原因之一。

二、與會心得 
本會議「ThinFilms 2008」的全名是「The 4th international conference on technological 
advances of thin films and surface coatings」，上一屆會議(第三屆)在民國 95年 11月於新加
坡舉辦的時候是由敝人自費資助碩士班學生參加。 
這次會議參加人員主要來自亞洲為主，包括新加坡本地的新加坡大學、南洋理工大
學、韓國、泰國、馬來西亞、印度、印尼、中國與台灣等地的教授與學生，來自歐美國
家的參加者較少。由於敝人每年固定參加 5 月於美國舉辦的國際冶金暨薄膜會議
(ICMCTF)，因此參加亞洲地區的國際會議次數較少；這次參加 ThinFilms 2008會議發現，
在歐美舉辦與在亞洲舉辦的薄膜國際會議，有以下兩點的明顯差異：1.亞洲舉辦的薄膜
國際會議，業界廠商參與發表論文的數量極少，可能是因為歐美相關業界在薄膜科技具
有領先地位有關，而在亞洲地區的業界廠商則相對薄弱，或是沒有意願將相關技術作公
開。2. 亞洲舉辦的薄膜國際會議，臨時棄權不參加口頭報告的人數眾多，在敝人歷年出
國參加美國舉辦的薄膜國際會議經驗中，這是很少發生的現象，而此次會議卻多的有點
離譜，尤其來自韓國、大陸以及印尼、印度、馬來西亞等南亞國家參加者的缺席數量偏
高，這點不知是否因為新加坡很好玩有關? 還是因為這些國家的薄膜研究相關學者的實
力較不佳?不過相對而言，台灣地區的教授與學生的表現都相當規矩，應出席、應發表的
時間都會準時出現，相當敬業! 
雖然本次會議臨時棄權不參加口頭報告的人數眾多，原本已規劃好幾場要去聆聽演
講者報告的場次都缺席，因而無法進一步了解其研究內容，實在很可惜，不過還好這次
大會安排的邀請演講內容精采，讓敝人收穫豐富，也是值得。 
也由於這次會議在新加坡舉辦，距離台灣較近，因此吸引許多來自台灣的教授與研
究生來參加。平時雖然大家都在台灣，卻難有機會碰面，這次來到新加坡，大家就有許
多機會共聚午/晚餐，可以好好聊一聊彼此的研究內容，交換研究心得、帶領學生進行研
究的方法與教學經驗，同時增加彼此的認識與友情，實在是敝人每次出國參加會議的重
要收穫，尤其可以從國內大老級學者學習到治學的理念與方法就實在令人感動。 
綜合觀之，薄膜研究已從單純的二元合金系統進入到複雜的三元、四元甚至多元合
金系統，其微結構的控制也從單一的奈米結晶型態進展到奈米複合與奈米多層之型態，
從控制每個微結構特徵的尺度變化，進而改變薄膜材料的各種特質，例如硬度、韌性、
耐磨性質等等，因此在薄膜材料的研究當中，微結構分析實在是非常重要。依據敝人的
經驗，現在幾乎每篇論文都需要有 TEM照片去詮釋薄膜之微結構，因此製作薄膜材料的
製程控制、薄膜性質測試方法與微結構分析已是三大重要課題。而微結構分析是最關鍵
的部分，也由於微結構分析才能讓我們對製程參數與材料特性的關聯性有進一步的認
知。因此我們必須搭配相當好的 TEM試片製作技術與觀察分析能力，才能得到具有相當

Abstract 
Taguchi method is widely applied to analysis the influence of deposition parameters on 
characteristics of thin films due to its efficiency and easy to operate. In this work, chromium nitride 
thin films were prepared by a bipolar symmetric pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering system. 
Deposition parameters including the power of targets, pulse frequency of target power and substrate 
bias voltage were selected as variables. The Taguchi method was used to develop experimental 
arrays for each coating. The electrochemical test in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution was conducted 
to evaluate the corrosion performance of coatings. The structures of chromium nitride films were 
characterized by an XRD. The surface and cross sectional morphologies of thin films were 
examined by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface roughness of thin films was 
explored by an atomic force microscopy (AFM). A number of trends were identified using Taguchi 
analysis method. The influences of deposition parameters on the texture, deposition rate and surface 
roughness were also investigated. It is observed that a chromium nitride coating with sufficient 
corrosion resistance and high deposition rate can be achieved through the following deposition 
parameters: target power of 300W, 2 kHz in target power frequency and under no substrate bias.

USA) with 50 kHz frequency, 15% reversing and 80% duty cycle. The target-to-substrate distance 
and substrate temperature were kept at 100 mm and 300oC, respectively. Different deposition time, 
5800s, 3200s and 1960s were selected for coatings deposited at 100W, 300W and 500W target 
power, respectively, to achieve a similar thin film thickness. 
The phases of each coating were investigated with a grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer 
(XRD, PANalytical, X’Pert PRO MPD, Netherlands) using the Cu Kα radiation generated from a 
Cu target at 40 kV and 30 mA. The cross sectional morphologies and chemical compositions were 
examined with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6500, JEOL, Japan) 
equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The nanoscale surface morphologies of 
thin films were examined by an atomic force microscopy (AFM, DI3100, Veeco, USA) using a 
Si3N4 tip. The surface roughness values were calculated from the AFM images. The corrosion 
resistance of each coating was studied by potentiodynamic polarization tests in 3.5 wt.% NaCl 
aqueous solution. A potentiostat, a standard calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference, and a Pt plate 
as the auxiliary electrode were employed. Potentiodynamic polarization tests were executed with an 
applied voltage from -300 mV to +800 mV vs. open circuit potential (OCP) and a sweep rate of 0.5 
mV/s. Three tests were conducted on each coating. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Composition and phase characterizations of CrN thin films 
 The chemical compositions of thin films are shown in Table 1. The Cr/N ratio ranges from 
0.83 to 1.29. For coatings at the same target power, for example, CrN#4, #5 and #6, the Cr/N ratio 
increases with increasing the negative bias voltage, which was caused by the increase of ion 
impingement energy and the preferential sputtering of N atoms [10]. It is also noticeable that the 
Cr/N ratio increases with increasing target power of Cr. It is suggested that more Cr atoms were 
sputtered into the plasma when the pulsing target power increased. Since the working pressure and 
Ar/N2 gas ratio were kept constant, the Cr/N ratio increased with increasing target power. The argon

its roughness [11,14]. The thickness of coating is revealed by FE-SEM, which ranges from 1.5 to 
2.0 µm. Typical columnar structure is observed on each coating. Cross-sectional morphologies of 
CrN#1 and CrN#5 are shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. For the CrN#1 coating, coarse 
columnar grains can be observed clearly. A rough surface morphology is also revealed. On the 
contrary, a rather dense and fine columnar structure can be recognized on CrN#5. It is also obvious 
that a thin pure Cr interlayer around 200 nm thick can be found between the Si substrate and CrN 
coating in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. In addition, the cross-sectional morphologies of CrN# 6 
and #8, which were deposited without substrate bias and with higher target power frequency, are 
denser and finer than CrN#1. The degree of structure modification increased with increasing target 
power frequency is responsible for the microstructure evolution [11]. The average deposition rate, 
in the unit of nm/W/min, of each coating was further calculated and listed in Table 1. It is obvious 
that the deposition rate decreases with increasing substrate bias. The increasing ion impingement 
and channeling/resputtering effects on growing films with increasing substrate bias are responsible 
for the decrease of deposition rate [14]. 
3.2 Corrosion resistance of CrN thin films 
 A family of polarization curves of CrN coatings deposited on SKD61 tool steels and uncoated 
SKD61 substrate in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 3. Electrochemical 
parameters of tested specimens are listed in Table 1. The calculated porosity, F, of each coating 
according to the following equation is determined [15].

where RP(coating) and RP(substrate) are polarization resistance of coating and SKD61 substrate, 
respectively. ∆Ecorr is the corrosion potential difference between coating and SKD61, and βa is the 
anodic Tafel slope of SKD61 substrate. It is obvious that a nobler corrosion potential, higher 
polarization resistance and lower corrosion current density is observed on each coating except 
CrN#2, which a rather high porosity is observed. Apparently, the corrosion resistance of the SKD61

The substrate bias is also found to be the most effective parameter on the surface roughness. 
The minimum surface roughness was observed on the CrN coating with 500 W target power, 10 
kHz target power frequency and -100V substrate bias. On the other hand, the target power is the 
most effective parameter on the calculated porosity. The minimum porosity was observed on the 
CrN coating with 300 W target power, 2 kHz target power frequency and 0V substrate bias. Same 
results were also observed for the most effective parameter on the polarization resistance and 
corrosion potential of coatings.  
According to the optimization parameters obtained in this work, it can be concluded that the 
deposition parameters including 300 W target power, 2 kHz target power frequency and 0 V 
substrate bias can be employed to produce the CrN coating with good corrosion resistance and high 
deposition rate in the same time. 
4. Conclusions: 
A series of CrN thin films have been prepared by the pulsed DC magnetron sputtering system 
based on the Taguchi experiment design method. The texture evolution of CrN from (111) to (200) 
and the refinement of grain size were observed due to the application of pulsing bias. The Ar 
content in the coating increased with increasing target power frequency. The -300V substrate bias is 
also responsible for the impingement of Ar. It is concluded that the substrate bias is the most 
effective parameters on the deposition rate and surface roughness. An optimized process parameter 
to deposit CrN coating with good corrosion resistance and high deposition rate is proposed in this 
work.

Multicomponent coatings based on different metallic and non-metallic elements 
possess the combined benefit of individual components leading to further improvement of 
coating properties. In this study, monolayered Ti-Al-N, multilayered Ti-Al-N/TiN, gradient 
Ti-Al-Si-N, and multilayered Ti-Al-Si-N/TiN coatings were synthesized by using a 
cathodic-arc evaporation (CAE) system. In addition to Ti, Ti33Al67 and Al88Si12 cathodes were 
used for the deposition of Ti-Al-N, and Ti-Al-Si-N coatings, respectively. The gradient 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N, and multilayered Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN possessed dense structure with 
nanograins separated by disordered grain boundaries. Those coatings possessed lower 
residual stress (-2.8~4.8 GPa) than that of monolayered Ti-Al-N (-6.8 GPa) and multilayered 
Ti-Al-N/TiN coatings (-5.7 GPa). The highest hardness was obtained for the gradient 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N (38±2 GPa) with Ti/(Ti+Al+Si) content ratio being 0.5. The multilayered 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN possessed the highest H3/E*2 ratio of 0.182±0.003 GPa, indicating the 
best resistance to plastic deformation, among the studied coatings.

Ti-Al-N and Ti-Al-Si-N coatings were studied.  
 
2. Experimental details 
Monolayered Ti-Al-N (TiAlN-SL), multilayered Ti-Al-N/TiN (TiAlN-ML), gradient 
Ti-Al-Si-N (TiAlSiN-GL), and multilayered Ti-Al-Si-N/TiN (TiAlSiN-ML) coatings were 
deposited on polished silicon by using a cathodic arc evaporation system [11]. Titanium, 
Ti33Al67 (33 at.% of Ti and 67 at.% of Al), Al88Si12 (88 at.% of Al and 12 at.% of Si) alloy 
targets were arranged on the chamber wall to deposit the coatings. In addition to Ti, Ti33Al67 
and Al88Si12 cathodes were used for the deposition of Ti-Al-N, and Ti-Al-Si-N coatings, 
respectively. A base pressure prior to deposition was less than 1 x 10-3 Pa. The samples were 
mounted on a rotational substrate holder for deposition of the coatings. The Ti-Al-N and 
Ti-Al-Si-N coatings were deposited at a N2 pressure of 2.0 Pa and substrate bias voltage of 
-80 V. The coating thickness of the deposited coatings was controlled at 1.3±0.2 μm. The 
cathode current (80-120 A) of Ti, Ti33Al67 and Al88Si12 cathodes was used to control the 
composition of the deposited coatings. The chemical content ratios of Ti/(Ti+Al) and 
Ti/(Ti+Al+Si) were controlled to be 0.4~0.5 for optimum mechanical properties.  
The deposited monolayered Ti-Al-N (TiAlN-SL), multilayered Ti-Al-N/TiN 
(TiAlN-ML), gradient Ti-Al-Si-N (TiAlSiN-GL), and multilayered Ti-Al-Si-N/TiN 
(TiAlSiN-ML) coatings were examined in a Jeol JSM-6700F high resolution field emission 
 3
respectively. By controlling the cathode current of Ti and Al88Si12 targets, the chemical 
composition varied from Ti0.67Al0.28Si0.05N (near the substrate) to Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N (top layer) 
in the gradient Ti-Al-Si-N (TiAlSiN-GL) coating. X-ray diffraction spectra from the 
deposited coatings were obtained (not shown here). All the deposited coatings showed 
B1-NaCl crystal structure and have multiple orientations of (111), (200), and (220). A 
preferred (111) orientation was shown in the monolayered Ti0.42Al0.58N and multilayered 
Ti0.42Al0.58N/TiN, and no softer hcp-AlN phase was observed [14]. Similar results were also 
found in previous studies [4, 15]. For the deposited Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N, the gradient 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N and multilayered Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN coatings also exhibited the 
B1-NaCl crystal structure. However, the preferred orientation was changed from (111) in 
Ti0.42Al0.58N to (200) plane in Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N. This indicated that the chemical composition 
would influence the development of the {200} texture in the Ti-Al-Si-N coatings deposited 
from different alloy cathode materials. Besides, the texture development of Ti-Al-N and 
Ti-Al-Si-N may change with different deposition parameters, such as bias voltage, nitrogen 
pressure, and cathode current [16, 17]. The stress-free lattice parameters of the 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N calculated from XRD pattern were 0.420 nm. In comparison with intrinsic 
lattice parameters of TiN(0.424 nm) and Ti0.42Al0.58N(0.421 nm), The lower lattice parameters 
of the deposited Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N coatings indicated a solid solution in these coatings [18].  
Fig. 1 shows cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the deposited monolayered 
 5
layers. Fig. 3 shows bright-field TEM and HRTEM micrographs of the multilayered 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN. The Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N layer possessed much denser structure than TiN 
due to the presence of Al and Si to form nanocomposite structure. The left HRTEM 
micrograph with corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern at area “A” 
demonstrated crystalline nanograins separated by disordered grain boundaries. M. P. Wojtan 
et al. [20] showed Si forms an amorphous SiNx in Ti-Al-Si-N coatings with only 6.5 at% of 
Si deposited by cathodic arc evaporation. Similar results were also found in Ti-Si-N coatings 
with 7.0 at% of Si [21].  In this study, it is the most probable that the Si forms an amorphous 
matrix being SiNx, which surrounds crystalline nanograins in the Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N layer.  
 
3.2  Mechanical properties  
Previous studies showed that the multilayered structure of Ti-Al-N/TiN and 
Ti-Al-Si-N/SiNx can reduce residual stress and improve adhesion [4, 22]. In this study, the 
residual stresses of monolayered Ti0.42Al0.58N (TiAlN-SL), multilayered Ti0.42Al0.58N/TiN 
(TiAlN-ML), gradient Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N (TiAlSiN-GL), and multilayered 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN (TiAlSiN-ML), those were determined by the sin2ψ method, are 
revealed in Table 1. The difference in magnitude was related to the residual stress which 
composed of an intrinsic component resulted from the growth process and an extrinsic 
component (thermal stress) due to the presence of different thermal expansion coefficients 
 7
elastic modulus values. With higher hardness and lower elastic modulus, the plastic 
deformation is lower, because the external load is distributed over a larger area and the stress 
distribution is more uniform. This behavior is then expressed by the H3/E*2 ratio, where H 
and E* are the hardness and effective modulus of the coating. E* could be further expressed as 
E*=E/(1-v2), where E is the Young’s modulus, and v is the Poisson ratio (~0.25) [23, 24]. The 
gradient Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N (TiAlSiN-GL), multilayered Ti0.42Al0.58N/TiN (TiAlN-ML) and 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN (TiAlSiN-ML) coatings exhibited higher H3/E*2 ratio than that of 
monolayered Ti0.42Al0.58N(TiAlN-SL) (0.140±0.003 GPa). The H3/E*2 ratio showed the 
highest value of 0.182±0.003 GPa for the multilayered Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN (TiAlSiN-ML) 
coating among the studied coatings. The H3/E*2 ratio was enhanced by the interface 
contribution of the multilayered Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N/TiN.  
 
4.  Conclusions  
1. In this study, monolayered Ti-Al-N, multilayered Ti-Al-N/TiN, gradient Ti-Al-Si-N, and 
multilayered Ti-Al-Si-N/TiN were synthesized by cathodic-arc evaporation. The WDS 
analysis showed atomic stoichiometries of Ti0.42Al0.58N, and Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N for the 
deposited Ti-Al-N and Ti-Al-Si-N coatings, respectively. All the Ti0.42Al0.58N and 
Ti0.50Al0.43Si0.07N coatings exhibited B1-NaCl crystal structure and have multiple 
orientations of (111), (200), and (220). Due to the addition of Si, the gradient

Abstract 
In this study, the Hastelloy-X superalloy samples were overlaid by a CoNiCrAlY bond coating 
using a high pressure high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray process. A thin platinum film around 
7.5 μm thick was further applied to the surface of CoNiCrAlY coating by a magnetron sputtering 
deposition process. Then the superalloys coupons with bare bond coat and Pt deposited bond coat 
were pack aluminized at 850oC for 4 hours to produce respectively (Ni,Co)Al and PtAl2 phases on 
surfaces. All specimens were subjected to a thermal cycling test at 1100oC. The effects of 
aluminizing, Pt-aluminizing on the cyclic oxidation behavior and the microstructure evolution of 
the coatings were evaluated. The microstructures analysis of the as-processed and tested coatings 
were carried out by using electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and electron 
probe microanalyser (EPMA) in an effort to relate the coating structure to performance and 
degradation mechanisms. Results confirmed that the roughness of the CoNiCrAlY coating did not 
change after aluminizing or the Pt-aluminizing process. The oxide scale spalled after 50 and 100 
hours oxidation for sprayed sample and aluminized sample respectively, while the oxide scale 
attached well to the substrate for the Pt-aluminized sample after testing for 150 hours. The 
Pt-aluminizing process significantly improved oxidation resistance of HVOF sprayed coating, while 
the aluminizing process had negligible effects.

and corrosion resistance [26] than single aluminized coatings. Most Pt aluminized coating studies 
relate to bare superalloys [21-28] and are rarely adapted to sprayed coatings [29, 30]. Recently, high 
velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying processes have drawn attention for preparing MCrAlY 
coatings. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the microstructures and oxidation behavior of 
aluminized, Pt-aluminized HVOF sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings. 
2. Experimental Procedure 
Hastelloy-X superalloy coupons with dimensions of 100mm×25mm×2mm were chosen as 
substrates. The substrates were abraded with # 800 SiC paper to remove the outer layer, then 
washed in distilled water and ultrasonically degreased in acetone. After that, both sides of the 
samples were grit-blasted with alumina powder to increase adherence between the CoNiCrAlY 
coating and the substrate. The samples were then sprayed with a Co-32.6Ni-21.1Cr-8.3Al-0.6Y (in 
wt. %) bond coat using a high pressure high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray system (Praxair 
Tafa JP8000) with a spraying distance of 30 cm and kerosene ( C7H16) was utilized as spray fuel. 
Oxygen flow rate, fuel flow rate and powder feed rate were respectively 56.7 SCMH, 4.8 GPH and 
82 g/min. The coating thickness was about 250 μm. A platinum thin film around 7.5 μm in thickness 
was further deposited on the surface of CoNiCrAlY coating by a magnetron sputtering process. The 
superalloy coupons with bare bond coat and Pt deposited bond coat were pack aluminized at 850oC 
for 4 hours to produce (Co,Ni)Al and PtAl2 phases on the surfaces, respectively. Two coatings were 
identified in this procedure as “aluminized” and “Pt-aluminized” coatings. Details of the pack 
aluminizing process were revealed in the previous study [2] except the Al-30 wt. % Co aluminizing 
powder was adopted in the experiments under review. Then, all specimens were subjected to a 
thermal cyclic test at 1100oC. Each testing cycle included a 60 min. exposure at 1100oC, followed 
by ambient air cooling for 10 min. Changes in mass were recorded every 2 cycles (except for the 
first cycle) utilizing a precision electronic balance with 0.1 mg accuracy.  Surface roughness of all 
as-processed samples were measured by profilometer (KOSAKA, SE 3500K) with a 4 mm travel 
length of and using a cut-off of 0.8 mm.

3.2 Oxidation behavior  
Figure 3 shows cyclic test results for all samples. The weight gain of a Pt-aluminized sample 
continued to increase after 150 cycles while the HVOF-sprayed and aluminized samples reached the 
maximum weight gain at 40 and 60 cycles, respectively, and then they dramatically lost weight. 
Weight gains of the aluminized and Pt-aluminized samples were similar at the outset, but weight 
gain of the HVOF-sprayed sample was significantly higher than that of the other two samples. 
Weight gains of all samples were lower than the plasma sprayed bare Ni-22Cr-10Al-1Y coating in 
previous studies [14, 15]. All curves in Fig. 3 present an uneven appearance which can be clarified 
as follows: the coatings are top coat-free and consist of protrusions, splats on their surfaces, once 
oxides grow in these sites, partial spallation of the above oxide layer could easily occur. Despite the 
unevenness, it can be concluded that Pt-aluminizing treatment significantly improves the oxidation 
resistance of the HVOF-sprayed Co-32.6Ni-21.1Cr-8.3Al-0.6Y coating.  
Figure 4 shows XRD results of the as-processed and the cyclicly tested sample of all samples. 
Results of HVOF-sprayed coatings are shown in Fig. 4 (a). The as-sprayed sample consists of 
γ-CoNiCrAl phase and a γ’-Ni3Al phase which were consistent with X-ray mapping results of 
EPMA analysis as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Diffraction patterns of samples were about the same after 
100 and 150 cycle tests, in which the Al2O3 and (Co,Ni)Al2O4 oxides were detected. The 
γ-CoNiCrAl phase also presented in the 100 cycleand 150 cycle patterns as an Al-depleted zone will 
be discussed in Fig. 5 (a). X-ray diffraction results of the aluminized coatings are shown in Fig. 4 
(b). The as-aluminized sample consists of a (Co,Ni)Al phase. Additional peaks of α-Al2O3 and 
γ-CoNiCrAl phases were observed after 100 cycles, which indicates part of the β-(Co,Ni)Al phase 
had transformed to Al-depleted γ-CoNiCrAl phase brought about by outward and inward diffusion 
of Al. Similar observations were reported on the pack aluminized Co-base [1], Ni-base [2] 
superalloys and HVOF sprayed coating [8] after cyclic oxidation tests. Additional peaks of 
(Co,Ni)Al2O4 oxide were detected after 150 cycles. These resulted in a dramatic weight loss in 
aluminized coating at the final stage as shown in Fig 3. The XRD patterns of Pt-aluminized coatings

5 wt. %, which is lower than the original level of 8.3 wt. %. An interdiffusion zone with 
β-(Co,Ni)Al phase precipitated from the coating was found in the center region of the coating. The 
EPMA cross-sectional microstructure and the X-ray mapping of the aluminized sample after150 
cycles are shown in Fig. 6 (b). Result show that a major β-(Co,Ni)Al phase and γ-CoNiCrAl phase 
were observed in the outer region. The Al-depleted γ-CoNiCrAl phase is identified near the surface 
due to the outward diffusion of Al to form α-Al2O3 oxide causing further severe oxidation of the 
coating. Fig. 6 (c) depicts the EPMA cross-sectional microstructure the X-ray mapping of the 
Pt-aluminized coating after150 cycles. The α-Al2O3 scale was found to attach firmly to the 
β-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase. Beneath the β-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase, was a mixed zone of a β-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al 
phase and a γ-CoNiCrAl phase in the center of the coating. The absence of a PtAl2 phase and the 
presence of a β-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase in Fig. 6 (c) confirms that the former phase had transformed to 
the β-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase due to oxidation of the coating and elemental interdiffusion. The EPMA 
and X-ray mapping results of tested samples are also consistent with the X-ray diffraction analysis 
of Fig. 4. It should be noted that the thickness of the β-(Co,Ni,Pt)Al phase layer is about 80 μm 
even after 150 cyclic oxidation tests.  
4. Conclusions  
 The results of this study showed that roughness of the CoNiCrAlY coating did not change 
after aluminizing or Pt-aluminizing. The Pt-aluminizing process improved the oxidation resistance 
of HVOF sprayed coatings significantly while the aluminizing process had negligible effects.  
For HVOF sprayed coating, the XRD and EPMA results showed that thermal growth oxides 
were similar and consisted of Al2O3 and (Co,Ni)Al2O4 on the surface of γ-CoNiCrAl phase. For 
aluminized coating, the α-Al2O3 and (Co,Ni)Al2O4 oxides were detected after 100 and 150 cycles. 
The EPMA analysis showed that the outer region consisted of a major β-(Co,Ni)Al phase and 
γ-CoNiCrAl phase after testing for 150 cycles. The Al-depleted γ-CoNiCrAl phase existed 
preferentially near the surface due to the growth of α-Al2O3 and thus caused a lower cyclic 
oxidation resistance. For Pt-aluminized coating, even after 150 cycles, only α-Al2O3 scale was
