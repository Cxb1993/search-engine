Abstract
The single-symplectic framework of dynamics of structures of multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF) and the
multi-symplectic framework of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional elastic continua are ad-
dressed in this report. Via the similarity of the rigid body motion and the dynamics of MDOF structures, we cast the
latter into a Hamiltonian system and develop a method of symplectic modal analysis under the single-symplectic
framework. By extending the symplectic framework from a single independent variable to multiple independent
variables, we establish the multi-symplectic framework of elastostatic and elastodynamic problems of different
dimensions. Under the multi-symplectic framework, the methodologies of solving different problems of elasticity
are built and investigated.
Keywords: Hamiltonian system, symplectic group, multi-symplectic framework, structural dynamics, damping,
modal analysis, anisotropic elasticity.
1 Introduction
The mechanical framework of Newton is the foundation of analysis, design and calculation in the arena of civil and
mechanical engineering for a long time. Most of theories such as engineering mechanics: statics and dynamics,
mechanics of materials, mechanics of structures, elasticity have adopted the Newtonian framework.
The Hamiltonian framework is another framework which was proposed much later than the Newtonian one in
classical mechanics. Basically the Newtonian and Hamiltonian frameworks are no discrimination between better
and worse. However, we should note that a series of important theories and analysis methods have been constructed
based on the Hamiltonian; especially, it plays a decisive role in the development of quantum mechanics.
Initially, problems which are treated under the Hamiltonian framework are those that can each be written as a
conservative system that consists of one independent variable and an even number of dependent variables. This
system possesses a variety of rich properties [36, 49, 57]. In order to tackle more and more problems, different ex-
tensions of the Hamiltonian system, such as the generalized Hamiltonian system, dissipative Hamiltonian, pseudo
Hamiltonian system, Birkhoff system were proposed. Recently, the effects of further extensions, applications, and
calculations for the Hamiltonian system have been published [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, 37, 38,
44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 54, 59, 65].

The matrix J is
J = −JT = −J−1 =
[
0n In
−In 0n
]
, (3)
where In ∈ Rn×n is an n × n identity matrix. Here and after 0n and 0n×m denote the n × n and n × m zero
matrix, respectively. For some problems of classical mechanics, the state z can be decomposed into the generalized
coordinates q ∈ Rn and the dual variable—the generalized momentum p ∈ Rn, i.e.
z =
[
p
q
]
.
It should be noted the matrix J of Eq.(2) is a full-rank square matrix with even dimension. If the state z with even
dimension consists of the equal-dimensional dual vectors p and q, Eq.(2) is called a canonical formulation of the
Hamiltonian system. Multiplying both sides of Eq.(2) by J, we obtain
J
d
dt
z =
∂
∂z
H. (4)
This equation is the keystone of extending a Hamiltonian system from a single independent variable to multiple
independent variables.
The Hamiltonian system (2) possesses two characterizing properties, namely the conservation of area and the
conservation of Hamiltonian:
1. The conservation of area
∂
∂t
(
vT1 Jv2
)
= 0, ∀v1,v2 ∈ P, (5)
where P ⊂ R2n, and v1 and v2 are two solutions of the following equation,
J
∂
∂t
Y = − ∂
2H
∂z∂zT
Y. (6)
2. The conservation of Hamiltonian
∂
∂t
H(z(t)) = 0. (7)
4 Dynamics of structures of multiple degrees of freedom
Consider the equation of motion of a structure of multiple degrees of freedom,
Mq¨ + f(q, q˙) = F, (8)
where q ∈ Rn denotes the generalized displacement which is the coordinates of the configuration space, M the
mass matrix, f the constitutive force, and F the external force. If we focus on a conservative system of linear
elasticity subjected to no external force (f = Kq,F = 0n), Eq.(8) may be written as a Hamiltonian system as
follows:
d
dt
[
p
q
]
=
[
0n −K
M−1 0n
][
p
q
]
=: Az = −J ∂
∂z
H, (9)
3
where the symplectic spectral matrix S and the symplectic modal matrix V can be written in terms of the eigen-
values and eigenvectors of Problem (14).
S =
[
ΣH 0
0 ΣH¯
]
, ΣH = diag(iω1, · · · , iωn), ΣH¯ = diag(−iω1, · · · ,−iωn),
V =
[
MΦNΣH MΦNΣH¯
ΦN ΦN
]
.
Since the symplectic modal matrix V is symplectically orthogonal, VTJV = J, the matrix N satisfies
ΣTHN
TmN−NTmNΣH = 0n,
ΣTH¯N
TmN−NTmNΣH¯ = 0n, (16)
ΣTHN
TmN−NTmNΣH¯ = I.
Now, we are going to construct the damping matrix in the symplectic space. Similar to the construction of the
modal damping matrix in the configuration space, we alter the symplectic spectral matrix to release the relation
ΣH = diag(iω1, · · · , iωn) and ΣH¯ = diag(−iω1, · · · ,−iωn), i.e. Σ2H 6= Σλ and Σ2H¯ 6= Σλ and thus define the
damping matrix to be
C = MΦN(Σ2H¯ − Σ2H)NTΦTM.
For example, we define symplectic spectral matrix as
S =
[
ΣH 0
0 ΣH¯
]
, ΣH = diag(µ1, · · · , µn), ΣH¯ = diag(µ¯1, · · · , µ¯n),
and obtain, according to Eq.(16)3,
N = diag([(µ1 − µ¯1)m1]−1/2, · · · , [(µn − µ¯n)mn]−1/2).
Hence, we construct the damping matrix in the symplectic space as follows.
C = −MΦdiag((µ1 + µ¯1)/m1, · · · , (µn + µ¯n)/mn)ΦTM.
5 Multi-symplectic framework in Structural mechanics
The Hamiltonian framework of ordinary differential equations is extended to the generalized Hamiltonian frame-
work of partial differential equations [62, 63, 64]. The governing equations of state z = z(x0, x1, · · · , xn) is
n∑
i=0
Ji
∂
∂xi
z =
∂
∂z
H. (17)
The square matrix Ji is merely antisymmetric and does not need to be of full rank. The dimensions of the gener-
alized coordinates q ∈ Rdq and their dual variables p ∈ Rdp are not required to be equal, so that the dimension of
state z can be even or odd. The formulation of Eq.(17) allows part of differential equations degenerate to algebraic
equations. When n = 0, x0 = t,J0 = J, z ∈ R2n, Eq.(17) returns to Eq.(4).
5
where Φ(x0, x1, x2, · · · , xn) satisfies
n∑
i=0
Ji
∂
∂xi
Φ =
∂2H
∂z∂zT
Φ,
and c is a constant vector. According to the area-preserving property, the matrix Φ obeys the rule
n∑
i=0
∂
∂xi
{ΦT (x0, x1, x2, · · · , xn)JiΦ(x0, x1, x2, · · · , xn)} = 0. (22)
In order to obtain a familiar formulation from Eq.(22), the Stokes’ theorem of matrix-valued m-form is used.
Theorem 1. If ω is a matrix-valued m-form on a manifoldM and c is an m+1-chain, then∫
c
dω =
∫
∂c
ω.
where d denotes the exterior derivative
Hence, we can find an n-form
ω =
n∑
j=0
ωjdx
?
j .
where
dx?j = (−1)jdx0dx1 · · · dxj−1dxj+1 · · · dxn,
and its exterior derivative is
dω =
n∑
j=0
∂
∂xj
ωjdx0dx1 · · · dxn.
On the basis of the Stokes’ theorem, we deduces from Eq.(22) that∫
∂D
{ΦT (x0, x1, x2, · · · , xn)JiΦ(x0, x1, x2, · · · , xn)}dx?j = 0, (23)
where D is an n+2-chain. It should be noted that Eqs.(22) and (23) are indeed the extensions of Eqs.(12) and (13),
respectively.
There is another solution assumed in the form
z(x0, x1, x2 · · · , xn) = f(p0x0 + p1x1 + · · · pmxm)d,
where f is a scalar function and d a vector. Substituting the assumed solution form into the governing equation,
we obtain[
n∑
i=0
pif
′Ji − fS
]
d = 0. (24)
After requesting the vector d to be independent of the field variables x0, x1, x2 · · · , xn, this equation reduces to a
differential equation
f = f ′,
and an eigenvalue problem[
n∑
i=0
piJi − S
]
d = 0. (25)

7 Multi-symplectic framework of 3D anisotropic elasticity
The governing equations of anisotropic elasticity are separated into the kinematic Eq.(26), equilibrium Eq.(27) and
constitutive Eq.(28) as follows.

(ui,j + uj,i) = ij , u˙i = vi, (26)
− σij,j + p˙i = bi, (27)
ij = Dijklσkl or σkl = Cklijij , ρvi = pi. (28)
Here an overdot denotes a material time derivative; ρ is mass density; Cijkl is the elasticity tensor with major
symmetry Cijkl = Cklij and minor symmetry Cijkl = Cjikl; DijklCklrs = δirδjs; and ui, ij , vi, σij , pi, bi are the
displacement, strain, velocity, stress, momentum, body force per unit volume, respectively. After rearrangement of
Eqs.(26)-(28), we write the governing equations in the form of Eq.(17) as follows.(

Now we move our attention to the static problem of anisotropic elasticity. In this case, the generalized coordi-
nates and the dual variables become u and σ, respectively. Using the state variables z =
[
σT uT
]T
, Stroh [53]
advocated an approach, which now is termed the Stroh formalism, to solving the boundary value problem of elas-
tostatics for media with material symmetries (anisotropic, monotropic, orthotropic, transversely isotrpoic, cubic,
isotropic) or crystal systems (triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal, cubic). The ap-
proach is so powerful and systematical for the two-dimensional problem. We re-explore this problem and refine the
properties of the solution. The relation between the solution of the two-dimensional problem of anisotropic elastic-
ity and the holomorphic function of complex analysis were constructed. We detailed the findings in Supplement 1.
We further tackled the three-dimensional problem of anisotropic elasticity by using commutative quaternions. The
results are referred to Supplement 2. However, there are many points should be illustrated by using commutative
quaternions or Clifford algebra to solve 3D anisotropic elasticity. Hence, we also study the function theory of
commutative quaternions (Supplement 3) and Clifford-valued boundary integral equations and boundary element
methods (Supplement 4).
8 The dynamics of linear-elastic rod in the multi-symplectic frame-
work
Consider a rod subjected to a distributed load f(t, x) with fixed-free boundary conditions. The kinematics, equi-
librium and constitution are
∂u
∂x
= ,
∂u
∂t
= v,
− ∂σ
∂x
+ p˙ = f, (30)
E = σ, ρv = p,
where u, , v, σ, p, f, E, ρ are the displacement, strain, velocity, stress, momentum, load per unit length, Young’s
modulus, and mass density, respectively. If we set x0 := t, x1 := x as space and time variables and define
H = 12z

then the governing equations (30) of rod are rewritten as

where J0 and J1 are antisymmetric.

gives three terms
−ρc2rf ′′1 + Ef ′′1 , ρc2rf ′′2 + Ef ′′2 , ρc2rf1f ′′2 + Ef1f ′′2 − ρc2rf ′′1 f2 + Ef ′′1 f2.
Since c2r = E/ρ, these three terms are always zero. This derivation demonstrates the area-preserving property
(12).
In the following, we move our attention to Eq.(23). Consider the rectangular zone D on the x0-x1 plane with
four vertices (0, 0), (r0, 0), (r0, r1), and (0, r1). The integral in Eq.(23) with n = 1 becomes∫ r1

(ξ1J1 − S)−1 J0 − ηI
]
d = 0, (39)
where η = −1/ξ0. After the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained, the solution can be constructed as the way
we have shown in Section 8.
10 The multi-symplectic framework of 1D continuum
In this section, we study the multi-symplectic framework of 1D continuum, or bar. The so-called “1D continuum”
is the combination of rod, shaft, and beam. In general, the models of rod, shaft, and beam describe the mecha-
nism of axial deformation, torsional-shear deformation, and the flexural deformation, respectively. Besides these
deformation mechanisms, we address the 1D continuum with the mechanism of shear deformation and warping
deformation.
In the following, we consider the multi-symplectic framework of 1D continuum with the mechanism of axial
deformation, torsional-shear deformation, the flexural deformation, shear deformation, and warping deformation.
Denoting x = x1, y = x2, z = x3, σxx = σ11, σyy = σ22, σzz = σ33, σyz = σ23, σxz = σ13, σxy = σ12, the
displacement field can be expressed as
ux = u(x) + zφy(x)− yφz(x) + uM (x, y, z)− ωθ(x),
uy = v(x)− (z − ez)φx(x),
uz = w(x) + (y − ey)φx(x),
where u, v, w are the average displacement in x, y, z-direction on the y-z plane, respectively, θ the unit twist angle
in x-direction, ω the sectorial coordinate, φx the rotation angle in the x-direction, φy and φz are the rotation angles
of the cross-section line in the y- and z- direction, respectively, ey and ez are the distance between shear center and
centroid projected on the y- and z-direction, respectively,
In the above equation, uM is the warping quantity in the x-direction,

This gives us the relations
(pJ1 − ipJ2 − S)X2 = 0,
(pJ1 − ipJ2 − S)X3 = −ip(pJ1 − S)X2, (52)
(pJ1 + ipJ2 − S)X2 = 0,
(pJ1 + ipJ2 − S)X3 = ip(pJ1 − S)X2.
Hence, the solution can be expressed as
z = c1 exp(px1 − ipx2)X2 + c2 exp(px1 + ipx2)X2,
where c1 and c2 are complex constants.
If p is a real parameter and c1 = c2 (resp. c1 = −c2), then
c1 exp(px1 − ipx2)X2 + c2 exp(px1 + ipx2)X2
= 2Re{c2 exp(px1 + ipx2)X2} (resp. = 2Im{c2 exp(px1 + ipx2)X2}).
Otherwise, the solution c1 exp(px1 − ipx2)X2 + c2 exp(px1 + ipx2)X2 is complex.
In addition, if selecting q as the parameter, the generalized eigenvalue problem
[J1 − λ (qJ2 − S)] b = 0
1For some cases with singular pJ1−S, a direct treatment of a generalized eigenvalue problem might not be avoided and the Kronecker’s
canonical form of matrix pencil J2 − λ (pJ1 − S) or (pJ1 − S)− qJ2 should be adopted.

where b is the eigenvector of the eigenvalue problem
[pJ1 + qJ2 − S] b = 0, (53)
whose the characteristic equation is(

There is an interesting point that the characteristic equation of both the eigenvalue problems
[J1 + ξJ2 − S] b = 0 and [ξJ1 + J2 − S] b = 0
are the same(

Solution properties of two dimensional problems of
anisotropic elasticity
Hong-Ki Hong and Li-Wei Liu
Abstract
The two-dimensional problems of anisotropic elasticity were re-explored and refined in this article.
Using the coordinate transformation we converted the governing equations with partial differentiation
into an eigenvalue problem with real-valued matrix. Three different ways were shown in this article. By
virtue of the classification of the solutions, we refined the formulation of solutions. Three formulations
were proposed and their relations were constructed. Furthermore we showed the connection between
the anti-holomorphic functions and the solution of anisotropic elasticity.
1 Introduction
The two dimensional problem of anisotropic elasticity attracts attention of scholars and engineers more
and more recently due to the developments of composite materials and smart materials. Among the
numerous methods for solving the problem, Lekhnitskii [7] and Stroh [12] proposed two different ap-
proaches, which we term respectively the Lekhnitskii formalism and Stroh formalism in this article, to
solving material symmetries (anisotropic, orthotropic, transversely isotrpoic, cubic, isotropic) or crys-
tal systems (triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal, cubic) systematically.
Both approaches convert a problem of finding solution for partial differential equations into an eigen-
value value problem with a sixth order characteristic equation. Although, the Lekhnitskii formalism
which starts at equilibrium conditions is different from Stroh formalism, the solutions of both approaches
reduce to the solution of the Kolosoff-Muskhelishvili approach [9], which only needs to solve a char-
acteristic equation of sixth order for an isotropic material. Both the Lekhnitskii formalism and Stroh
formalism can be recognized as certain methods of coordinate transformation in two dimensions.
Complex analysis is a power tool for solving two-dimensional problems of elasticity not only for
isotropic materials but also anisotropic materials. In the function theory of complex analysis, the holo-
morphic function is the most important kind of functions. A holomorphic function is exactly an ana-
lytic function and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. An anti-holomorphic function is the func-
tion whose conjugate function is holomorphic. In this article, we attempted to connect the solution of
anisotropic elasticity and the anti-holomorphic function.
The classification and completeness of the solution is demonstrated based on the theory of Jordan
block [3]. By virtue of the classification, we refine the formulation of solutions.

This is a characteristic equation of sixth order for the unknowns P11 and P12 corresponding to the second
order eigenvalue of Eq.(6). For the sake of clarity, we rewrite the eigenvalue problem to the compact
form as follows.(

where
(C11)ik = Ci1k1, (C12)ik = Ci1k2,
(C21)ik = Ci2k1, (C22)ik = Ci2k2.
4 The first order eigenvalue problem
In the previous sections, we proposed the method and derived a second order eigenvalue problem for
solving the problem of anisotropic elasticity. In the following, we will derive the first order eigenvalue
problem to overcome the issues. If we introduce
b =
(
C21 +
P12
P11
C22
)
a,
and divide by P 211 Eq.(6), the first order eigenvalue problem is derived as([
C11 0
C21 −I

P11
[
C12 I

C21 −I
]
+ P12
[
C12 I
C22 0
])[
a
b
]
= 0. (9)
This eigenvalue problem plays the key role of solving the two dimensional problem of anisotropic elas-
ticity. If we can handle this eigenvalue problem, the general solution of the two dimensional problem of
anisotropic elasticity can be found. In the following two sections, we demonstrate two other approaches
to deriving this eigenvalue problem.

This equation is exactly the same equation of Eq(9).

In section 4, we reduced the second order eigenvalue problem into the first order one. For a 6 × 6 real
matrix, its complex eigenvalues must be complex conjugate pairs and its Jordan form has 3 possible

8 The formulations and the properties of the solutions
In this section we attempt to write down the form of solutions and find its relations with holomorphic
functions. Firstly we partition the matrices ΦI and ΦII into three parts as follows.
Φ =

where the matrix Σ is in the form of Eq.(15), (16) and (17) for the cases of six, four, and two independent
eigenvectors, respectively. We also write the solutions as[

For the case Σ belongs to the form of Eq.(15), we further set α = iqj and ψj = ( ∂∂y1 + i
∂
∂y2
)wj , then
the j-th component of the above

becomes
(

+
∂2
∂y22
)wj(y1, y2) = 0.
The function wj satisfies the Laplace equation in the domain (y1, y2), hence it has the form
wj(y1, y2) =
1
2
wˆj(y1 + iy2) +
1
2
wˇj(y1 − iy2),
where wˆj(y1 + iy2) and wˇj(y1 − iy2) are holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions in the domain
(y1, y2), respectively. Hence,
ψj = wˇ

j(y1 − iy2). (23)
According to the coordinate transformation, we further write ψj in the coordinate (x1, x2) as follows:
ψj = wˇ

j(x1 + qjx2).
Now, we are going to discuss the properties of solutions for the case Σ belongs to the form in Eq.(16).
We specify α = iq1 and write the first two equations of Eq.(22)1 as follows.
−q1( ∂∂y1 − i ∂∂y2 )ψ1 = 0,
− ∂∂y1ψ1 − q1( ∂∂y1 − i ∂∂y2 )ψ2 = 0.
The solution of ψ1 was shown in Eq.(23)1 for j = 1 and the solution of ψ2 is
ψ2 = wˇ

(y1 + iy2)

wˇ′′1(y1 − iy2). (24)
In terms of the coordinate x1, x2, x3, we rewrite the solution ψ2 as
ψ2 = wˇ
′
2(x1 + q1x2)−
(x1 − q1x2)
2q1
wˇ′′1(x1 + q1x2).
If the matrix Σ is in the form of Eq.(17), we specify α = iq1 and write the first three equations of
Eq.(22)1 as
−q1( ∂∂y1 − i ∂∂y2 )ψ1 = 0,
− ∂∂y1ψ1 − q1( ∂∂y1 − i ∂∂y2 )ψ2 = 0,
− ∂∂y1ψ2 − q1( ∂∂y1 − i ∂∂y2 )ψ3 = 0.
The solution of ψ1 and ψ2 were shown in Eq.(23)1 for j = 1 and Eq.(24). The solution of ψ3 is
ψ3 = wˇ

If we substitute Eq.(20) into the above equation, the relation between the function ϕ and the function ψ
are derived,
ϕ = ΦITL N2Φψ.
Besides the connection of ϕ and ψ, the relations between functions fi and ωˇi are written as in the
following.

dimensional problem. As shown in [11], there exists an arbitrary factor t ∈ (0, 2pi] in the argument of biharmonic
function f(ix1+cos tx2+sin tx3) where i2 = −1. In this article, we extended complex analysis to the commutative
quaternions analysis for solving three dimensional problem of generally anisotropic material. We searched the roots
of characteristic equation of three dimensional problem in the field of commutative quaternions instead of the field
of complex number. We use the notations R, C, Hc to denote real number, complex number, and commutative
quaternion number, respectively.
2 Clifford algebra and Clifford analysis in C`n
Consider n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn with orthonormal base vectors e1, e2, . . ., en, and further define the
multiplication rule of the base vectors:
ekel + elek = 2δkl, k, l = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The definition of Clifford conjugate (·) is
uv = v¯u¯, u, v ∈ C`n,
e¯k = −ek, k = 1, 2, · · · , n.
On the basis of the aforementioned base vectors, one can construct the basis {eα} of Clifford algebra C`n as
follows:
eα = eα1α2...αk = eα1eα2 . . . eαk , 1 ≤ α1 < α2 < . . . < αk ≤ n, α ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}.
One further define a unit element eφ = e0 ≡ 1, then any element a of real Clifford algebra C`n(R) can be
represented in terms of basis {eα} as
a =
∑
α
eαaα,
where aα ∈ R. a is termed a Clifford number or a multivector. Similarly, the element of complex Clifford algebra
C`n(C) is
a =
∑
α
eαaα, aα ∈ C.
The notation C`+n denotes the even subalgebra of C`n and the notation C`
k
n denotes the k-vector part of C`n.
The function which is defined in domain Ω ⊂ Rn with range C`n(R) can be represented as
f(x) =
∑
α
eαfα(x).
Now we consider a two-dimensional example. Let e1 and e2 be orthonormal base vectors and define the
multiplication rule of base vectors
e21 = e
2
2 = 1, e1e2 = −e2e1.
2
Jordan block of the most size q. In fact, there are a lot of definitions of matrix function in literature [12]. Similarly,
the definition of chain rules for the matrix function is not unique [4]. We adopt the development of Mathias [9]
and introduce it as following. If a function f is (2p− 1)-differentiable over Ω, the derivative of f(A(t)) is
d
dt
f(A(t)) =
{
f
([
A(t) A′(t)
0 A(t)
])}
1,2
where {}1,2 denotes ”taking the value of the 1,2 block of the matrix”. Furthermore, if the matrix A(t) commutes
with its derivative A′(t), the function f is analytic, and its Maclaurin series converges over Ω, the chain rules of
matrix function
d
dt
f(A(t)) = A′(t) f ′(ξ)
∣∣
ξ=A(t)
,
must hold.
2.2 Differentiability and derivability
In this section, we discuss the differentiability and derivability of Clifford-valued function. Consider a Clifford-
valued function f : Ω→ C`n where Ω ⊂ RN , i.e. the functions of the form
f(x) =
∑
α
fα(x)eα
in which x =
∑n
i=1 xiei and fα(z) are real valued. The increment of f(x) is
df(x) =
∂f
∂x1
dx1 +
∂f
∂x2
dx2 + · · ·+ ∂f
∂xn
dxn
=
∂f
∂x1
dx1 +
∂f
∂x2
dx2 + · · ·+ ∂f
∂xn−1
dxn−1 (3)
+ dxn
(
en∇f − ene1 ∂f
∂x1
− ene2 ∂f
∂x2
− · · · − enen−1 ∂f
∂xn−1
)
= dxnen∇f + (dx1 − ene1dxn) ∂f
∂x1
+ (dx2 − ene2dxn) ∂f
∂x2
+ · · ·
+ (dxn−1 − enen−1dxn) ∂f
∂xn−1
.
We introduce another variable zk = xk − xnenek and then rewrite the above equation as following:
df = dz1
∂f
∂x1
+ dz2
∂f
∂x2
+ · · ·+ dzn−1 ∂f
∂xn−1
.
Obviously, this equation implies the function f is left differentiable if and only if f is left monogenic in Ω, i.e.
∇f = 0.
Now we want to show the derivative of a left monogenic function f(z) could be defined as the left differential
coefficient between two differential (n − 1)-forms. We introduce the Hodge star operator ? and apply it to the
one-form dz to obtain
dω(n−1) := ?dz = dxˆ1e1 − dxˆ2e2 + · · ·+ (−1)n−1dxˆnen,

Commutative quaternions or so called generalized Serge quaternions or reduced biquaternions is constructed
by the bases “1”, “e”, “i”, “ei”. The multiplication table of the bases is shown in Table 1. In fact, the basis “i”
is the pseudo-scalar “e1e3e3” and the basis “1” is the scalar “1” in C`3. The basis “e” is the one of base vectors
e1, e2, e3, hence remaining basis ei = e1e2 is 2-vecto. For example, if one select e = e3, the remaining basis
ei = e1e2.
An element of commutative quaternion is the number of the form
y = a1 + a2e+ a3i+ a4ie, a1, a2, a3, a4 ∈ R, y ∈ Hc.
Besides the (1, e, i, ei)-representation of commutative quaternions, the idempotent representation (1, i, ζ1, ζ2) is
the second option to define a number of Hc as follows.
y = (b1 + ib2)ζ1 + (b3 + ib4)ζ2, b1, b2, b3, b4 ∈ R, y ∈ Hc.
It is easy to find the relation between these two representations as follows,
a1 =
1
2
(b1 + b3), a2 =
1
2
(b1 − b3), a3 = 1
2
(b2 + b4), a4 =
1
2
(b2 − b4),
or
b1 = a1 + a2, b2 = a1 − a2, b3 = a3 + a4, b4 = a3 − a4.
There is a representation for someone familiar with matrix algebra. If we select the basis e = e3, the bases 1,
e, i and ie are isomorphic to the matrices[
1 0
0 1
]
,
[
1 0
0 −1
]
,
[
i 0
0 i
]
, and
[
i 0
0 −i
]
,
respectively.
In fact, the matrix representation is the best way to build the function theory of commutative quaternions. We
define a function f with commutative quaternionic value whose domain Ω ⊂ Hc, f : Ω→ Hc, is
f(y) = f
([
a1 + a2 + i(a3 + a4) 0
0 a1 − a2 + i(a3 − a4)
])
, y = a0 + a1e+ a2i+ a3ie ∈ Ω.
Obviously, the function theory of commutative quaternion is the function theory of the matrix algebra. For a 2× 2
diagonal matrix A = diag [A11, A22], the function f(A) of the matrix A is defined as [6]
f(A) = diag [f(A11), f(A22)] .
Hence, we can define a function of commutative quaternion as
f(y) =
[
f(a1 + a2 + i(a3 + a4)) 0
0 f(a1 − a2 + i(a3 − a4))
]
, y = a0 + a1e+ a2i+ a3ie ∈ Ω.
Furthermore, we will use a convenient from for the function of commutative quaternions in terms of idempotent
representation as follows,
f(y) = f(b1 + ib2)ζ1 + f(b3 + ib4)ζ2.
6
Using Eq.(5) and f = ρ/2c2
∑3
i=1 biei, Eq.(7) is rewritten as follows:
∇
[
7c1 − 12c2 − 6c3
2c2
(∇u+ u∇) + 5c1 − 9c2 − 5c3
2c2
(∇u− u∇)
]
+
c1 − 2c2 − c3
c2
3∑
i=1
(ei∇ei∇eiui)+f = 0.
If we introduce the operators E and ∇ˆ where
E : v0 + v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3 + v12e12 + v23e23 + v13e13
−→ 7c1 − 12c2 − 6c3
c2
v0 +
c1 − 2c2 − c3
c2
(v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3)
+
5c1 − 9c2 − 5c3
c2
(v12e12 + v23e23 + v13e13),
∇ˆ : a1u1 + a2u2 + a3u3 −→ e1∇a1u1 + e2∇a2u2 + e3∇a3u3, a1, a2, a3 ∈ C`13,∇∇ˆ = 0,
the governing equation (7) becomes
(∇+ ∇ˆ)E((∇+ ∇ˆ)u) + f = 0. (8)
There is another way to apply the Clifford analysis into the isotropic material of elasticity. We detialed the
findings in [8].
4 Anisotropic elasticity
The three dimensional problems of anisotropic elasticity is the theme of this article. The preparation is made by
introducing Clifford algebra and its subalgebra and the corresponding theory of analysis. In the following, we start
to tackle this subject. The displacement ui and the strain ij satisfy the kinematic relations as follows.
ij =

(
∂
∂xj
ui +
∂
∂xi

, i.j = 1, 2, 3. (9)
The stress is requested to satisfy equilibrium conditions.
∂
∂xj
σij = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, (10)
For anisotropic material, the constitutive law of the stress and strain are
σij = Cijklkl, i.j = 1, 2, 3, (11)
where the elasticity tensor Cijkl satisfies the symmetry conditions Cijkl = Cklij , and Cijkl = Cjikl. According to
the material symmetry (anisotropic, orthotropic, transversely isotrpoic, cubic, isotropic) or crystal system (triclinic,
monoclinic, orthorhombic, trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal, cubic), the independent material parameters are shown
in Table 2.
In there and following, dummy index obeys the summation convention. If we combine Eqs.(9), (10) and (11),
the governing equation of anisotropic elasticity is derived

4.2 The first order eigenvalue problem
In previous sections, we proposed the method and derived a second order eigenvalue problem for solving the
problems of anisotropic elasticity. The second order eigenvalue problem is hardly handle and not easy to extract
the framework of anisotropic elasticity. Following, we will derive the first order eigenvalue problem to overcome
the issues. If we set P11 = 1 and introduce the vectors
b = (C21 + P12C22 + P13C23)a,
c = (C31 + P12C32 + P13C33)a,
Eq.(13) reduce to the 1st order eigenvalue problem as follows:

This eigenvalue problem is a key point to solve three dimensional problem of anisotropic elasticity. If we can
handle this eigenvalue problem, the general solution of three dimensional problem of anisotropic elasticity can be
found. In the following two sections, we demonstrate two other approaches to derive this eigenvalue problem.
4.3 The second approach to derive first order eigenvalue problem
The first order eigenvalue problem of Eq.(16) is derived in last section. This section address second approach to
derive Eq.(16). Introducing 6 stress functions gi, hi, i = 1, 2, 3, such that σi1 = − ∂∂x2hi − ∂∂x3 gi, σi2 = ∂∂x1hi,
and σi3 = ∂∂x1 gi, the constitutive equations σij = Cijkl

4.5 Solving eigenvalue problems
In the previous sections, we proposed the first order eigenvalue problem (16). The is a eigenvalue problem with two
parameters P12 and P13. We extended the field of eigenvalues from complex numberC to commutative quaternions
Hc. Hence the eigenvalue problem can be rewritten as follows.
((ζI + ζII)N1 + (ζI + ζII)P12N2 + (ζI + ζII)P13N3) (ζI + ζII)d = 0
Since the idempotent property, ζIζI = ζI, ζIIζII = ζII, and orthogonal properties, ζIζII = 0, the eigenvalue
problem becomes(
N1 + q
IN2 + r
IN3
)
dIζI +
(
N1 + q
IIN2 + r
IIN3
)
dIIζII = 0,
where qI := ζIP12, r
I := ζIP13, p
II := ζIIP12, r
II := ζIIP13, and d
I := ζId, d
II := ζIId. For specified the value
of P12 (the values of qI and qII), we obtain the following equations
N1Φ + P12N2Φ +N3ΦΣ = 0.
The matrix Φ consists of the eigenvectors and the generalized eigenvectors of eigenvalue problem (16) and the
matrix Σ is diagonal or Jordan form if there exists nine independent eigenvectors or not, respectively. The choice
of the value of P12 depends on the boundary conditions of the problem. It should be noted that the matrices Φ and
Σ and the parameter P12 are commutative quaternionic valued.

a subalgebra of Clifford algebra C`3(R) [12] in Section 2. The isomorphism of
C2×2 matrix and Clifford algebra C`3(R) enabled us to develop the function
theory of commutative quaternion via the theory of matrix function in Sec-
tion 3. In Section 4, we defined polygenic and monogenic functions using the
way of differential quotient which is similar to the Cauchy approach for intro-
ducing holomorphic functions in complex analysis. Then we discussed their
derivatives and pointed out the same classification of functions in complex
analysis proposed in [13].
2. Algebraic structure and arithmetic of commutative
quaternion
A commutative quaternion x is a number with four component as
x = x0k0 + x1k1 + x2k2 + x3k3, x0, x1, x2, x3 ∈ R,
and can be regraded as vector part Vec(x) = x1k1 + x2k2 + x3k3 and scalar
part Sc(x) = x0 with further definition of basis k0 = 1. The rule of addition
of two commutative quaternions x and y = y0 + y1k1 + y2k2 + y3k3 is as
four-vector as follows:
x+ y = (x0 + y0) + (x1 + y1)k1 + (x2 + y2)k2 + (x3 + y3)k3.
The multiplication rule of the bases k1, k2, and k3 is
k1k2 = k2k1 = k3,k1k1 = 1,k2k2 = k3k3 = −1. (2.1)
It should be noted k1 6= 1 although k1k1 = 1. The multiplication of bases
was summarized as following.
k1 k2 k3
k1 1 k3 k2
k2 k3 −1 −k1
k3 k2 −k1 −1
Hence, the multiplication of any two commutative quaternions x and y is
xy = yx = (x0y0 + x1y1 − x2y2 − x3y3) + (x0y1 + x1y0 − x2y3 − x3y2)k1
+(x0y2 + x1y3 + x2y0 + x3y1)k2 + (x0y3 + x1y2 + x2y1 + x3y0)k3.
We use the symbol Hc to denote the algebra of commutative quaternions.
The multiplication rule of bases defined in Eq.(2.1) is easy to find the
idempotent property
1 + k1
2
1 + k1
2
=
1 + k1

1− k1
2
=
1− k1
2
,
1 + k1

= 0.
If we defined the idempotent bases e+ :=
1+k1
2 and e− :=
1−k1
2 , a commuta-
tive quaternion x can be represented by
x = x+e+ + x−e−, (2.2)
where x+ = (x0 + x1) + (x2 + x3)k3 and x− = (x0 − x1) + (x3 − x2)k3 were
termed idempotent components. Since the basis k3 is commutative with other
4 Hong-Ki Hong and Li-Wei Liu
Actually, commutative quaternion can be recognized as a subalgebra of
Clifford algebra C`3 by identifying
k1 = e3, k2 = e1e2, k3 = e123, (2.4)
where the bases of C`3 obey
eiej + ejei = 2δij , i, j = 1, 2, 3.
Hence, three involutions of the commutative quaternion x, xˆ, x˜ and x are
grade involution, reversion, and conjugation in C`3 [12]. Besides, isomorphism
of the 2 × 2 complex matrix and Clifford algebra C`3 enable us to represent
the bases of Hc by using four matrices as follows:
k0
iso
=
[
1 0
0 1
]
, k1
iso
=
[
1 0
0 −1
]
, k2
iso
=
[
i 0
0 −i
]
, k3
iso
=
[
i 0
0 i
]
.
(2.5)
Hence, the idempotent bases e+ and e− are represented by
e+
iso
=
[
1 0
0 0
]
, e−
iso
=
[
0 0
0 1
]
,
and Hc
iso
= C⊕ C where C denotes complex algebra.
3. Function theory of commutative quaternion
Matrix computation is familiar with scientists and engineers. In last section,
we indicated four bases of commutative quaternion is isomorphic to four C2×2
diagonal matrices. Hence, subtraction, addition, multiplication, and division
of commutative quaternion can be computed via matric computation. Fur-
thermore, the isomorphism enabled us to recognize the function of commuta-
tive quaternion as the function of matrix and construct the function theory
of commutative quaternion. We were going to demonstrate this argument in
this section.
The definition of the matrix function roots in the function of complex
variable. For example of the most simple case, if f(z), z ∈ C is a polynomial
such as f(z) = a0 + a1z + a2z
2 + · · · + amzm, where a0, a1, a2, · · · , am ∈ C,
then the corresponding matrix function is defined by replacing the complex
variable z with matrix A as f(A) := a0 + a1A + a2A
2 + · · · + amAm. The
theory of matrix function regulates what the function of matrix is meaningful
and is the core of our method to building the function theory of commutative
quaternion. In the literature, there exists many kinds of the theory of matrix
function and the equivalence had been study [15]. Among the matrix function
theories, the function theory of the diagonalizable matrices was our concerned
and was stated it following.
Theorem 3.1. If a matrix A ∈ Cn×n is diagonalizable, it can be represented
as
A = SΛS−1,

4. Derivatives and monogenic functions in Hc
The function theory was developed via the theory of matrix function in last
section. In this section, we further studied the polygenic and monogenic func-
tions of commutative quaternion. In order to construct the theory of poly-
genic function, the proposition of polar representation (Proposition 4.1) and
its inverse proposition (Proposition 4.3) were proposed firstly.
Proposition 4.1. For every commutative quaternion x = x0 + x1k1 + x2k2 +
x3k3 ∈ H×c , it can be written as polar form as follows:
x = r exp(θ1k1 + θ2k2 + θ3k3). (4.1)
In this formulation, the parameters r, θ1, θ2, and θ3 are determined by
r exp(θ1) = r1, r exp(−θ1) = r2,
cos(θ3 + θ2) =
x0 + x1
r1
, sin(θ3 + θ2) =
x3 + x2
r2
, (4.2)
cos(θ3 − θ2) = x0 − x1
r1
, sin(θ3 − θ2) = x3 − x2
r2
,
where r21 = (x0 + x1)
2 + (x3 + x2)
2 and r22 = (x0 − x1)2 + (x3 − x2)2.
Proof. A commutative quaternion x = x0 +x1k1 +x2k2 +x3k3 as we shown
in Eq.(2.2) can be represented as idempotent form
x = [(x0 + x1) + k3(x3 + x2)]e+ + [(x0 − x1) + k3(x3 − x2)]e−.
Since the basis is identified with the complex unit, the coefficients of idem-
potent bases e+ and e− can be written as polar forms
x = r1(cosα+ k3 sinα)e+ + r2(cosβ + k3 sinβ)e−,
in which cosα = x0+x1r1 , sinα =
x3+x2
r1
, cosβ = x0−x1r2 , and sinβ =
x3−x2
r2
, for
the case of r1 6= 0, and r2 6= 0.
A commutative quaternion y = r exp(θ1k1+θ2k2+θ3k3) is an exponen-
tial function of the computative quaternion θ1k1+θ2k2+θ3k3. Furthermore,
according to the idempotent form of the argument,
[θ1k1 + k3(θ3 + θ2)]e+ + [θ1k1 + k3(θ3 − θ2)]e−,
and the statement proposed in Eq.(3.3), y can be reformulated as
y = r exp(θ1) exp[(θ3 + θ2)k3]e+ + exp(−θ1) exp[(θ3 − θ2)k3]e−.
If we required x = y, Eq.(4.2) was obtained. 
In this proposition, there is an interesting discovery
r2 = r1r2 = [(x0 + x1)
2 + (x3 + x2)
2]1/2[(x0 − x1)2 + (x3 − x2)2]1/2 = |x|2.
Hence, the absolute of x is an index of whether or not x ∈ H×c .
Corollary 4.2.
|x| 6= 0,∀x ∈ H×c ,
|x| = 0,∀x ∈ Hc \H×c

Proof. Since partial derivatives of f exist, its differential df is

∂x2

dx3.
According to Proposition 4.1, the differential of the identity function, x 7→ x,
is dx = dx0 + dx1k1 + dx2k2 + dx3k3 and can be written as
dx = dr exp(θ1k1 + θ2k2 + θ1k3),
where
dr exp(θ1) = dr1, dr exp(−θ1) = dr2,
cos(θ3 + θ2) =
dx0 + dx1
dr1
, sin(θ3 + θ2) =
dx3 + dx2
dr2
,
cos(θ3 − θ2) = dx0 − dx1
dr1
, sin(θ3 − θ2) = dx3 − dx2
dr2
,
dr21 = (dx0 + dx1)
2 + (dx3 + dx2)
2, dr22 = (dx0 − dx1)2 + (dx3 − dx2)2.
We write the inversion of dx, as dx−1 = 1dx = dr
−1 exp(−θ1k1−θ2k2−θ1k3)
or furthermore in terms of the idempotent form,
dx−1 = dr−1 exp(−θ1 − (θ3 + θ2)k3)e+ + dr−1 exp(−θ1 − (θ3 − θ2)k3)e−.
Therefore

tive clock or Kasner clock in [13]. For the monogenic (holomorphic) function,

5. Conclusion
Two topics in the analysis of commutative quaternion was studied in this
article. After pointing out that commutative quaternion is a subalgebra of
Clifford algebra C`3, the isomorphism between Clifford algebra C`3 and C2×2
matrix enabled us to reconstruct the function theory of commutative quater-
nion. Any function which exists in complex analysis was be extended into a
function of commutative quaternion and has the idempotent representation.
We further explored the differentiability of commutative quaternion in
the different way of Price. For the polygenic function f(x) whose partial
derivatives with xi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 exist, its derivative at x = x0 has infinity
values which depends not only on the point x0 but also on the direction
which x approaches x0. The monogenic function has single-valued derivative
and satisfies the set of partial differential equations (4.7) as well as the Price’s
result.

Abstract
The three-dimensional (3D) displacement field in elastic body subjected to body force usually governed by the Navier-Cauchy
equation is here formulated in the language of Clifford valued functions and the Dirac operator. Using Clifford analysis and
considering arbitrary body force, we solve the problem, expressing the displacement field in terms of one harmonic function and
one monogenic function.

1. Introduction
The theory of complex algebra and complex variable has been used to solve two-dimensional (2D) problems of
elasticity for a long time. For the problems without body force, Kolosoff and Muskhelishvili [18,22] successfully
used two holomorphic functions to solve a biharmonic equation on a 2D domain. Considering the problems with
body force, Stevenson [26] used a displacement potential which consists of two holomorphic functions. Without the
displacement potential, England [10] adopted one harmonic function and one holomorphic function to represent the
displacement directly. Both England’s and Stevenson’s approaches deal only with conservative body forces.
In the above-mentioned approaches, the theory of complex analysis provides a powerful tool and enables one
to attack the 2D problems. However, it is not comfortable for complex analysis to treat a three-dimensional (3D)
problem. Piltner [23] extended the Kolosoff-Muskhelishvili approach to find six functions which satisfy the 3D
biharmonic equation and then construct from the six functions the solutions to the 3D problems of elasticity. In the
approach, there exists an arbitrary factor t ∈ (0, 2pi] in the argument of the biharmonic function f (ix1+cos tx2+sin tx3)
where i2 = −1.
Clifford algebra was introduced by Clifford in 1878 [1,21]. The elements of Clifford algebra are called Clifford
numbers or multivectors which are allowed to do addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. Hestenes et
al. [7,8,13–17] advocated the application of Clifford algebra in 1960s and achieved the usage of one general lan-
guage — Clifford’s geometric algebra — in physics and mathematics [19,20]. Clifford algebra provides a complete

with the coefficients aα ∈ R (resp. C). a is termed a Clifford number or a multivector. The terms a0, e1a1+e2a2+e3a3,
e12a12 + e13a13 + e23a23, and e123a123 are respectively the scalar, vector, bivector, and pseudo-scalar parts of Clifford
number a. Since in the present article we do not use Cℓ3(C), we will use Cℓ3 in the following to denote Cℓ3(R) without
extra notification.
The definition of Clifford conjugate (·) is
ac = c¯a¯, a, c ∈ Cℓ3,
e¯k = −ek, k = 1, 2, 3.
The notation Cℓ+3 denotes the even subalgebra of Cℓ3. Any element a of Cℓ
+
3 is expressed as
a = e0a0 + e12a12 + e13a13 + e23a23.
Quaternion algebra is isomorphic to the algebra Cℓ+3 . Hence, the outcomes of Tsalik [27] and Bock and Gu¨rlebeck
[3] can be easily translated into the version of Cℓ+3 . In addition, complex algebra is also a subalgebra of Cℓ3 whose
element is written as
a = a0 + e123a123,
where a0, a123 ∈ R.
A function defined in domain Ω ⊂ R3 with range Cℓ3 can be represented as
f (x) = e0 f0(x) + e1 f1(x) + e2 f2(x) + e3 f3(x) + e12 f12(x) + e13 f13(x) + e23 f23(x) + e123 f123(x).
Using the basis vectors, one can define a first order vector differential operator
D := e1
∂
∂x1
+ e2
∂
∂x2
+ e3
∂
∂x3
.
It is often called the Dirac operator. A Clifford valued function f : Ω ⊂ R3 → Cℓ3 satisfying
Df = 0, (resp. f D = 0)
is said to be left-monogenic (resp. right-monogenic). According to the multiplication rule of the basis vectors, the 3D
Laplace operator △ can be decomposed as
∂2
∂x21
+
∂2
∂x22
+
∂2
∂x23
=: △ = DD = D2. (1)
A function which satisfies the Laplace equation is said to be harmonic. A monogenic function is exactly a harmonic
function, but a harmonic function could not be monogenic.
3. Application of Clifford analysis to 3D problems of elasticity
The displacement field u j in elastic body subjected to body force bi is governed by the Navier-Cauchy equation,
3∑
j=1
(λ + µ)
∂2
∂xi∂x j
u j +
3∑
j=1
µ
∂2
∂x j∂x j
ui + ρbi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3. (2)
In this section we rewrite the Navier-Cauchy equation using Clifford valued functions and the Dirac operator. First, we
introduce the Clifford valued displacement u = e1u1 + e2u2 + e3u3 ∈ Cℓ3 and body force b = e1b1 + e2b2 + e3b3 ∈ Cℓ3.
Further, pre-multiplying the i = 1, i = 2, and i = 3 components of Eq. (2) by the basis vectors e1, e2, and e3,
respectively, and summing them up, we obtain

(λ + µ)D(Du + Du) + µDDu + ρb = 0. (3)
