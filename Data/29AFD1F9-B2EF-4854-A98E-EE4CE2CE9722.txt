In this report, we study the impact of quantized CDI on the secrecy rate achievable by 
AN-assisted beamforming. Although the optimal signaling scheme is unknown for channels 
without knowledge of the eavesdropper’s channel, AN-assisted beamforming has been shown to 
be optimal in the high SNR regime when the transmitter has full knowledge of the legitimate 
receiver’s channel and is equipped with a large number of antennas [2]. This scheme is also 
optimal when the transmitter perfectly knows both the legitimate receiver’s and the 
eavesdropper’s channels [6]. When only quantized CDI is available at the transmitter, the AN 
that was originally intended to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception may now leak into the 
legitimate channel, causing degradation in the achievable secrecy rate. We refer to this as the AN 
leakage problem, which will be the main focus of our works. 
 
II. MAIN OBJECTIVES 
In this project, we first examine the optimal power allocation between the message-bearing 
signal and the AN for a given number of feedback bits . We show that, when  is sufficiently 
large (good CDI quality), the power should be allocated evenly among the message-bearing 
signal and the AN; whereas, when  is small (poor CDI quality), the power allocated to the AN 
must be more conservative in order to limit the effects of AN leakage. Moreover, when  is 
fixed, we observe that in contrast to the perfect CDI case, the achievable secrecy rate will be 
upper-bounded by a constant regardless of the transmission power. Therefore, to maintain a 
constant secrecy rate loss (compared to the perfect CDI case), we show that  must scale 
logarithmically with the transmission power . In this project, the channel quality information 
(CQI) is assumed to be unknown at the transmitter. However, we are able to show that, in the 
case of quantized CDI, additional CQI at the transmitter provides little performance gains when 
 is sufficiently large, which justifies our interest at the CDI only.  
The results of this project are first examined for the multiple-input single-output 
single-antenna eavesdropper (MISOSE) case, where the transmitter has multiple antennas and 
both the receiver and the eavesdropper have only a single antenna. The results are later extended 
to the multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) scenario, 
where both the receiver and the eavesdropper are assumed to have multiple antennas. The results 
of this project have been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications and are 
currently under second-round revision. 
III. LITERATURE REVIEW 
The concept of secret communication in the physical layer and the notion of secrecy 
capacity was first introduced by Wyner in his pioneering work on wiretap channels [1]. Basic 
extensions of this work to non-degraded discrete memoryless broadcast channels and basic 
Gaussian channels were given in [7] and [8], respectively. The notion of physical-layer secrecy is 
different from the common approach adopted in modern communication systems that are based 
on application-layer cryptography [9]. The latter often involves the exchange and distribution of 
4 
codeword  and a decoder  at the legitimate receiver that maps the received 
sequence  to an estimated message . Define the error event as . 
Perfect secrecy and secrecy capacity are defined as follows. 
Definition 1 (Secrecy Capacity): Perfect secrecy is achievable with rate  if, for any 
, there exists a sequence of -codes and an integer  such that, for any 
, 
 
where  is the secret message,  and  are the collections of  and  over code 
length , respectively. The secrecy capacity is the supremum of all achievable secrecy rates. 
In this report, we consider the case where the eavesdropper’s channel  and noise 
variance  are unknown to the transmitter. In this case, the optimal signaling for the MISOSE 
channel is unknown (except for special cases given in [2] [10]). To guarantee secrecy, Goel and 
Negi proposed in [3] the use of artificial noise (AN) to disrupt the reception of eavesdropper 
while beamforming the message towards the legitimate receiver. The transmitted signal is given 
by 
                                 (1) 
where  is the message-bearing signal with ,  is the normalized 
beamforming vector for ,  is a matrix with columns that form an 
orthonormal basis for the AN subspace, and  is the AN vector which is a random Gaussian 
vector with distribution . Here  and  are assumed to be independent. 
 
MISOSE Secrecy Rate with Quantized CDI 
 
Following the studies on quantized channel feedback in [12], [13], we assume that the receiver is 
able to obtain perfect knowledge of , but can send back only a quantized version of the CDI, 
i.e., , to the transmitter due to limited feedback channel bandwidth. The CQI, i.e., 
, is assumed unknown at the transmitter. However, as we show later in Section V, lack of 
such information under the quantized feedback scenario has little impact on the secrecy rate 
when the transmission power  is large. 
Suppose that the CDI  is quantized into one of  unit-norm channel vectors in the 
codebook  according to the minimum distance criterion [12], and the 
corresponding index, denoted by , is sent back to the transmitter. 
Let  be the corresponding quantized CDI vector. The quantization cell associated with 
 is given by 
                                              (3) 
To gain analytical insights on the impact of quantized CDI, we adopt the random vector 
quantization (RVQ) codebook [12], [13], where each codeword is a randomly and independently 
6 
                  (10) 
In fact, this secrecy rate is bounded even for arbitrary distributions of  and with the CQI at 
the transmitter, as we will show later in Section V. 
In contrast, in the perfect CDI case where  is perfectly known at the transmitter, one can 
impose AN perfectly in the null space of  (i.e., choosing ) so that there is no noise 
leakage, that is,  (or ). The resultant secrecy rate in (9) is given by 
                   (11) 
which obviously can be made arbitrarily large by increasing . 
In this project, we will examine the optimal power allocation between the message-bearing 
signal and the AN for the MISOSE case. The MISOSE feedback bit scaling law and and 
discussions on the impact of CQI are also provided. Then we will extend the bit scaling law to 
the MIMOME scenario. Finally, we will present our simulation results. The detailed proofs and 
derivations can be found in our publications attached in the Appendix A and also in [17]. 
 
V. SUMMARY OF RESEARCH RESULTS 
Power Allocation of Signal and Artificial Noise under Quantized CDI 
 
 We first study the power allocation between message-bearing signal  and AN  for a 
given number of feedback bits . To this end, we first present a useful lemma which shows that 
for  large, the second term inside  in (9) will converge to a fixed value. 
Lemma 1: Let  be the exponential integral, it follows that 
       (12) 
In this case, for  sufficiently large, the achievable secrecy rate in (9) can be expressed 
approximately as 
                       (13) 
where 
                              (14) 
 
are the squared channel gains of  that fall, respectively, in the direction of  and in the 
orthogonal subspace of  (while normalized by their respective dimensions). Let us define 
8 
channel quantization is coarse, i.e.,  is not large enough, one should allocate less power for the 
AN simply owing to the severe AN leakage. While we have examined the optimal power 
allocation strategy under quantized CDI, this is not yet sufficient to guarantee a bounded secrecy 
rate loss compared to the perfect CDI case, as we will present in the following. 
 
Scaling of the Number of Feedback Bits in the MISOSE Case 
We have shown the optimal power allocation between the message-bearing signal and the 
AN has been presented to reduce the secrecy rate loss under a given transmission power . 
However, as  increases, the secrecy rate loss compared to the perfect CDI case will become 
arbitrarily large for a fixed  since the achievable secrecy rate under perfect CDI (c.f. (11)) 
increases without bound while that under quantized CDI (cf. (9)) is bounded for any value of . 
To resolve this problem, we derive in this section the value of  that is needed for maintaining 
a constant secrecy rate loss.  
Let us define the secrecy rate loss as 
                               (17) 
where . The bound follows since the secrecy rate under quantized CDI is 
generally not maximized with . Note, by Proposition 1, that  when  is large.  
Recalling (9) and (11), and the worst-case assumption of , we have 
              (18) 
and 
      (19) 
As noted in [12], for any two independent and isotropically distributed unit-norm vectors 
, their squared inner product will be Beta-distributed with parameters 
, i.e., . Applying this result to  and , one 
can have . This implies that the second term inside  in (18) 
can be written as 
           
where we have used the fact that . The same argument also applies 
to the second term inside  in (19) since  and  are also independent and isotropically 
distributed under RVQ. Therefore, the second terms inside  in both (18) and (19) yield the 
same value, and thus the secrecy rate loss in (17) can be bounded as 
   (20) 
10 
The proof of Corollary 1 is given in [17]. It is worthwhile to note that, with  fixed, the 
upper bound given in (23) can increase without bound by increasing the ratio  since 
 will go to zero in this case. Therefore, by Corollary 1, the ratio between the achievable 
secrecy rate in (9) and the upper bound in (23) will approach , when  is fixed and when  
and  are sufficiently large. That is, the secrecy rate loss will become negligible compared to 
the achievable secrecy rate. Since the bound in (23) holds for arbitrary distributions of  and 
for full CQI at the transmitter, Corollary 1 further implies that Gaussian  is nearly optimal 
and the CQI at the transmitter does not provide much gain for the achievable secrecy rate in (9). 
 
Extensions to the MIMOME Scenario 
Now we extend our studies to the MIMOME scenario where , , and derive the 
scaling of the number of feedback bits  under this scenario. The received signals at the 
receiver and the eavesdropper can be expressed as 
                                        (24) 
where we have assumed that the eavesdropper does not suffer from noise. As in the MISOSE 
case, the channel matrices  and  are assumed to be ergodic block 
faded, with each entry being i.i.d. complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance. 
Assume that . Let  be the singular value decomposition of 
, where  is a unitary matrix,  is a diagonal matrix with the 
singular values of  being the diagonal elements, and  is a semi-unitary matrix. 
The transmitter knows a quantized version of the CDI, i.e., . Let 
 be a matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the null space of 
, the transmitted signal is given by , where  is the message-bearing 
signal with distribution , and  is the imposed AN with distribution 
. We let  and  where , in 
order to constrain the transmission power within . Substituting  and 
 into (24) yields 
                (25) 
Since , the legitimate receiver will experience AN leakage, resulting in the 
following achievable secrecy rate [3] 
        (26) 
Similar to the MISOSE case, the secrecy rate due to imperfect CDI also converges to a constant 
as  goes to infinity. For the case where perfect CDI is available at the transmitter, the transmit 
signal is given by . Since  and , the achievable 
MIMOME secrecy rate with perfect CDI is given by 
  (27) 
12 
  (31) 
where , , , 
in which . By Lemma 2, we have that  
 
Since  and  are statistically independent (by Lemma 2), it follows with probability one 
that  is full rank [21]. Hence, the secrecy rate loss  can be further bounded by 
  (32) 
where the second inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality, the statistical independence 
between  and  [21], and Lemma 2. For the first term in (32), since 
 [21], we have 
   
where the first inequality is due to the fact that  for any  
Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix . For the second term in (32), by Lemma 2 and the fact 
that  [21], one can show that  
       (33) 
The third term  in (32) is, however, difficult to evaluate. By applying Jensen’s 
inequality and Lemma 2, we have 
. We note that (by (29)) the 
right-hand side (RHS) of this inequality approaches zero for  sufficiently large; while the 
term  is also close to zero with high probability for  
sufficiently large due to random quantization codebook. We therefore make the approximation 
 for  sufficiently large. By substituting these 
results into (32), we obtain 
 
 (34) 
By (34), to maintain a constant secrecy rate loss of , i.e., , it suffices to have 
 
 (35) 
where . Note that the  in (35) scales as  for fixed  and .

bound in (22). 
In Fig. 4, we also verify the MISOSE secrecy rate in (9) versus  under  = 25 dB 
using (22). Again, the results meet our theoretical developments. In Fig. 5, we show the 
simulation results of the MISOSE secrecy rate in (9) versus  for  = 0.9 and  = 10 and  
= 32, respectively. The secrecy rate upper bound in (23) [see Theorem 2] is also simulated. As 
expected, the secrecy rate with quantized CDI is upper bounded, in sharp contrast to that with 
perfect CDI. Also, for large , one can observe that the secrecy rate with quantized CDI in (9) 
approaches the upper bound in (23) (for both cases of  = 10 and  = 32), which coincides 
with our discussions before and demonstrates that additional CQI at the transmitter only

VI. SELF EVALUATION 
 In this project, the impact of quantized CDI on the achievable secrecy rate was studied for 
multiple antenna wiretap channels. By assuming that the eavesdropper’s channel was unknown at 
the transmitter, we adopted the transmission scheme where AN was imposed in the null space of 
the legitimate receiver’s channel to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception. It has been shown that, 
in the ideal case where perfect CDI was available at the transmitter, the achievable secrecy rate 
could be made arbitrarily large by increasing the transmission power. However, when only 
quantized CDI is available, the AN that was originally intended to jam the eavesdropper may 
now leak into the legitimate receiver’s channel, causing significant secrecy rate loss. For a given 
number of feedback bits  and transmission power , we derived the optimal power allocation 
among the message-bearing signal and the AN to maximize the secrecy rate under AN leakage.

1constraint where the eavesdropper is not allowed to infer any information from its received
signal, a non-zero secrecy capacity in a static channel can only be achieved when the legitimate
receiver has a better channel condition than the eavesdropper. Yet, this can be overcome in
wireless environments by exploiting the time-varying characteristic of fading channels [2], [3].
Further enhancements are attainable by employing multiple antennas at the transceivers, e.g., in
[4]–[6]. However, most of these works rely on perfect knowledge of the legitimate receiver’s and
the eavesdropper’s channels. To guarantee secrecy without knowing the eavesdropper channel,
the work in [5] proposed the use of artificial noise (AN) in the null space of the legitimate
channel to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception. The secret message is then beamformed towards
the legitimate receiver on top of the AN. With perfect knowledge of the legitimate receiver’s
channel direction information (CDI) at the transmitter, it has been shown that the secrecy rate
achievable by using AN can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the transmission power.
However, this may not be the case in practice since in general only quantized CDI is available
at the transmitter due to rate-limitations on the feedback channel.
The main contribution of this paper is to study the impact of quantized CDI on the secrecy
rate achievable by AN-assisted beamforming. Although the optimal signaling scheme is unknown
for cases without knowledge of the eavesdropper’s channel, AN-assisted beamforming has been
shown to be optimal in the high SNR regime when the transmitter has full knowledge of the
legitimate receiver’s channel and is equipped with a large number of antennas [4]. This scheme
is also optimal when the transmitter perfectly knows both the legitimate receiver’s and the
eavesdropper’s channels [6]. When only quantized CDI is available at the transmitter, the AN
that was originally intended to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception may now leak into the
legitimate channel, causing degradation in the achievable secrecy rate. We refer to this as the
AN leakage problem.
In this work, we first examine the optimal power allocation between the message-bearing
signal and the AN for a given number of feedback bits B. We show that, when B is sufficiently
large (good CDI quality), the power should be allocated evenly among the message-bearing
signal and the AN; whereas, when B is small (poor CDI quality), the power allocated to the
AN must be more conservative in order to limit the effects of AN leakage. Moreover, when B
is fixed, we observe that in contrast to the perfect CDI case, the achievable secrecy rate will

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND BACKGROUND
Let us consider a wireless system that consists of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, and an
eavesdropper with Mt, Mr, and Me antennas, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. The system
model presented in this section is focused only on the MISOSE case where Mt > Me = Mr = 1;
while extensions to the MIMOME case (where Me ≥ 1 and Mr ≥ 1) will be presented in Section
VI. Let x[i] ∈ CMt×1 be the symbol vector transmitted in the ith time slot under the average
power constraint E [‖x[i]‖2] ≤ P . The signals received at the receiver and the eavesdropper are
yr[i] = hrx[i] + zr[i] and ye[i] = hex[i] + ze[i], (1)
respectively, where hr,he ∈ C1×Mt are channel vectors of the receiver and the eavesdropper,
respectively, with the same distribution CN (0, IMt), and zr[i] ∼ CN (0, 1), ze[i] ∼ CN (0, σ2e)
are the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Note that, in this case, the channel directions
gr = hr/‖hr‖ and ge = he/‖he‖ are isotropically distributed on the unit sphere [12]. In this
paper, we will assume that hr and he are ergodic block-fading channels that remain constant
over a sufficient amount of time for signal transmission and feedback, and the messages are
coded across multiple fading blocks (c.f. (9) below). Our results can be readily extended to the
case with ergodic fast-fading channels [3].
Most works on physical-layer secrecy consider the problem of reliably communicating a secret
message from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver subject to a constraint on the information
attainable by the eavesdropper. Consider a (2nR, n)-code with an encoder μn : Wn → CMt×n
that maps the message w ∈ Wn = {1, 2, . . . , 2nR} into a length-n codeword {x[i]}ni=1 and a
decoder νn at the legitimate receiver that maps the received sequence {yr[i]}ni=1 to an estimated
message wˆ ∈ Wn. Define the error event as En = {wˆ = w}. Perfect secrecy and secrecy capacity
are defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Secrecy Capacity [2] [4]): Perfect secrecy is achievable with rate R if, for any
ε′ > 0, there exists a sequence of (2nR, n)-codes and an integer n0 such that, for any n > n0,
Pr(En) ≤ ε′, and H(w|{ye[i]}ni=1,hnr ,hne )/n > R− ε′,

5To gain analytical insights on the impact of quantized CDI, we adopt the random vector quantiza-
tion (RVQ) codebook [7], [8], where each codeword is a randomly and independently generated
Mt-dimensional unit-norm complex Gaussian vector and, thus, is isotropically distributed in
C
1×Mt [12]. Moreover, we will also utilize the quantization cell approximation (QCA) model
[7], [14], where each quantization cell V is approximated by a Voronoi region of a spherical cap
with the surface area approximately equal to 2−B of the total surface area of the Mt-dimensional
unit sphere. It has been shown in [7], [8] that the behavior of RVQ can be closely approximated
by this model, even for small B. Specifically, the quantization cell V in (3) is approximated by
V ≈ {g| |gcH |2 ≥ 1− δ}, δ = 2−
B
Mt−1 . (4)
Define |grgˆHr |2 = |grcH |2  cos2 θ ≥ 1 − δ. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
sin2 θ is [7]
Pr(sin2 θ ≤ x) =
⎧⎨⎩ 2BxMt−1, for 0 ≤ x ≤ δ1, otherwise. (5)
When only the quantized CDI gˆr is available at the transmitter, the beamforming vector p
and the matrix Q in (2) are set to gˆHr and Ngˆr , respectively, where Ngˆr has columns that form
an orthonormal basis for the null space of gˆr. Therefore, the transmitted signal is given by
x[i] = gˆHr s[i] +Ngˆra[i]. (6)
Note that finding the optimal p and Q under quantized CDI is in general difficult due to AN
leakage. Our choice of using p = gˆr is motivated by [7] [9] where the multi-user interference
in their case has a similar effect as the AN leakage in our case. To satisfy the power constraint
E[‖x[i]‖2]=σ2s+(Mt−1)σ2a≤P , we set σ2s =αP and σ2a= (1−α)PMt−1 , where α ∈ [0, 1] denotes the
fraction of power allocation. Since the eavesdropper’s noise variance σ2e is assumed unknown
to the transmitter, we shall consider throughout the rest of this paper the worst-case scenario
where σ2e = 0. By (1), the received signals of the receiver and the eavesdropper are given by
yˆr[i] = ‖hr‖(grgˆHr )s[i] + ‖hr‖(grNgˆr)a[i] + zr[i], (7)
and yˆe[i] = hegˆHr s[i] + heNgˆra[i], (8)
respectively. One can observe from (7) that, due to imperfect CDI, the AN that was originally
intended for the eavesdropper also interferes with the legitimate receiver. By assuming that s[i]

such that Rˆ(α) ∼= (F (α))+. By taking the derivative of F (α) and setting it to zero, i.e., ∂F (α)∂α = 0,
it follows that the optimal α, denoted by α, must satisfy the necessary condition

Although a closed-form solution of α is not easily computable due to the intractability of
the expectation term in (15), explicit results can be obtained for two interesting special cases,
namely, the case of weak AN leakage and the case of strong AN leakage. In the case of weak
AN leakage, B is assumed sufficiently large such that AN leakage is much smaller than AWGN,
i.e. γgˆ⊥r (1 − α)P  1. On the other hand, in the case of strong AN leakage, B is assumed to
be small such that γgˆ⊥r (1− α)P  1. For the former case, we have the following proposition:
Proposition 1 (Weak AN Leakage): Let αw be the value that satisfies 1−αwαw = d(αw), where

. Then, for B > (Mt − 1) log(P/) and any  such that
1−αw
αw
>  > 0, the optimal power allocation fraction α of Rˆ(α) in (13) satisfies αw− l < α <
αw + u for Mt sufficiently large, where both u, l > 0 and will approach 0 as  approaches 0.
The proof is provided in Appendix B. Note that d(α) comes from (15). Numerically, we
can show that αw ≈ 0.554. The fact that α is close to one half can also be roughly observed
from (9). Specifically, with B sufficiently large, AN leakage will be negligible and the first
term in (9) will be proportional to logα when Mt is large. Also, by applying the approximation

|w1wH2 |2 ∼ β(1,Mt−1). Applying this result to ge = he/‖he‖ and gr, one can have |hegHr |2 =
‖he‖2β(1,Mt − 1). This implies that the second term inside (·)+ in (18) can be written as

where we have used the fact that ‖heNgr‖2 = ‖he‖2−|hegHr |2. The same argument also applies
to the second term inside (·)+ in (19) since ge and gˆr are also independent and isotropically
distributed under RVQ. Therefore, the second terms inside (·)+ in both (18) and (19) yield the
same value, and thus the secrecy rate loss in (17) can be bounded as
ΔR ≤ E[log(1+ ‖hr‖2 ·αpP )]−E

By further evaluating the expectation and by applying Jensen’s inequality [16], we show in
Appendix D the following theorem:

be chosen such that

proaches to 0 as Mt or P increases. Hence, to guarantee a constant secrecy rate loss, B must
scale linearly with Mt or logarithmically with P , i.e., B = Ω(Mt logP ) in big-Ω notation [17].

VI. EXTENSIONS TO THE MIMOME SCENARIO
In this section, we extend our studies to the MIMOME scenario where Mr, Me ≥ 1, and
derive the scaling of the number of feedback bits B under this scenario. The received signals at
the receiver and the eavesdropper can be expressed as
yr = Hrx+ zr and ye = Hex, (24)
where we have assumed that the eavesdropper does not suffer from noise. As in the MISOSE
case, the channel matrices Hr ∈ CMr×Mt and He ∈ CMe×Mt are assumed to be ergodic block
faded, with each entry being i.i.d. complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.
Assume that Mt ≥ Mr +Me. Let Hr = VΣUH be the singular value decomposition of Hr,
where V ∈ CMr×Mr is a unitary matrix, Σ ∈ CMr×Mr is a diagonal matrix with the singular
values of Hr being the diagonal elements, and U ∈ CMt×Mr is a semi-unitary matrix. The
transmitter knows a quantized version of the CDI, i.e., Uˆ ∈ CMt×Mr . Let NUˆ ∈ CMt×(Mt−Mr)
be a matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the null space of UˆH , the transmitted
signal is given by x = Uˆs+NUˆa, where s ∈ CMr is the message-bearing signal with distribution
CN (0, σ2sIMr), and a ∈ CMt−Mr is the imposed AN with distribution CN (0, σ2aIMt−Mr). We let
σ2s = αP/Mr and σ2a = (1− α)P/(Mt −Mr) where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, in order to constrain the
transmission power within P . Substituting x = Uˆs+NUˆa and Hr = VΣUH into (24) yields
yr = VΣU
HUˆs+VΣUHNUˆa+ zr and ye = HeUˆs+HeNUˆa. (25)
Since UHNUˆ = 0, the legitimate receiver will experience AN leakage, resulting in the following
achievable secrecy rate [5]
RˆM(α) =
(
E
[
log
∣∣∣IMr + σ2sUˆHUΣ (IMr + σ2aΣUHNUˆNHUˆUΣ)−1ΣUHUˆ∣∣∣ ]
− E
[
log
∣∣∣IMr + σ2sUˆHHHe (σ2aHeNUˆNHUˆHHe )−1HeUˆ∣∣∣ ])+. (26)
Similar to the MISOSE case, the secrecy rate due to imperfect CDI also converges to a constant
as P goes to infinity. For the case where perfect CDI is available at the transmitter, the transmit
signal is given by x = Us+NUa. Since UHU = IMr and UHNU = 0, the achievable MIMOME
secrecy rate with perfect CDI is given by
RM(α) =
(
E
[
log
∣∣IMr+Σ2σ2s ∣∣]−E [log ∣∣∣IMr + σ2sUHHHe (σ2aHeNUNHUHHe )−1HeU∣∣∣])+. (27)

arguments as in the MISOSE case and by the fact that NUNHU = IMr −UUH and NUˆNHUˆ =
IMr − UˆUˆ
H
, the second terms inside (.)+ of (27) and (26) turn out to be identical. Hence the
MIMOME secrecy rate loss ΔRM  maxαRM(α)−maxα RˆM(α) can be upper bounded as
ΔRM ≤ E
(
log
∣∣IMr +Σ2σ2s ∣∣)− E(log ∣∣∣IMr + σ2s UˆHUΣΩ−1ΣUHUˆ∣∣∣)
≤ E (log ∣∣IMr +Σ2σ2s ∣∣)− E(log ∣∣∣σ2s UˆHUΣΩ−1ΣUHUˆ∣∣∣) , (31)
where Ω  IMr +σ2a ΣUHNUˆNHUˆUΣ, and σ

s = α

p,MP/Mr , σ
2
a = (1− αp,M)P/(Mt −Mr)
in which αp,M = argmaxαRM(α). By Lemma 2, we have that UˆHU = UˆHUˆXY+ UˆH SˆR =
XY. Since X and Y are statistically independent (by Lemma 2), it follows with probability one
that UˆHU is full rank [19]. Hence, the secrecy rate loss ΔRM can be further bounded by
ΔRM ≤E
[
log
∣∣IMr +Σ−2/σ2s ∣∣]+ E [log |Ω|]− E [log ∣∣∣UHUˆUˆHU∣∣∣]
≤ log ∣∣IMr + E [Σ−2] /σ2s ∣∣+ log ∣∣IMr + σ2a E[Σ2]E[RHR]∣∣− E[log ∣∣YHY∣∣] , (32)
where the second inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality, the statistical independence be-
tween Σ and UHUˆUˆHU [19], and Lemma 2.
For the first term in (32), since E [Tr ((HrHHr )−1)] = E [Tr(Σ−2)] = Mr/(Mt −Mr) [19],
log
∣∣∣∣IMr + E [Σ−2] 1σ2s
∣∣∣∣ ≤ Mr log(Tr (IMr + E [Σ−2])Mrσ2s
)
= Mr log
(
1 +
1/σ2s
Mt −Mr
)
,
where the first inequality is due to the fact that |A| 1Mr ≤ Tr(A)/Mr for any Mr×Mr Hermitian
positive semidefinite matrix A. For the second term in (32), by Lemma 2 and the fact that
E [Σ2] = MtIMr [19], one can show that
log
∣∣IMr + σ2a E[Σ2]E[RHR]∣∣ = Mr log (1 + σ2a MtD/Mr) . (33)
The third term −E (log ∣∣YHY∣∣) in (32) is, however, difficult to evaluate. By applying Jensen’s in-
equality and Lemma 2, we have −E [log ∣∣YHY∣∣] ≥ − log ∣∣E [YHY]∣∣ = −Mr log (1−D/Mr).
We note that (by (29)) the right-hand side (RHS) of this inequality approaches zero for B
sufficiently large; while the term log
∣∣YHY∣∣ = log ∣∣∣UHUˆUˆHU∣∣∣ is also close to zero with
high probability for B sufficiently large due to random quantization codebook. We therefore
make the approximation −E [log ∣∣YHY∣∣] ≈ −Mr log (1−D/Mr) for B sufficiently large. By
substituting these results into (32), we obtain

large P , one can observe that the secrecy rate with quantized CDI in (9) approaches the upper
bound in (23) (for both cases of B = 10 and B = 32), which coincides with our discussions in
Section V and demonstrates that additional CQI at the transmitter only provides little gain on
the achievable secrecy rate as P is large.
We show in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 the MIMOME secrecy rate in (26) versus α and P , respectively.
The numbers of antennas of the receiver and the eavesdropper are set as 2 (Mr = Me = 2).
Similar observations as in the MISOSE case can be seen from the two figures, that is, the
optimum α decreases to around 0.5 when B increases, and the secrecy rate is upper bounded
for finite B. The MIMOME bit scaling law in (35) is also examined, and the results are shown
in Fig. 8. Although the lower bound in (35) is derived through some approximations, one can
see from Fig. 8 that constant secrecy rate loss can still be maintained using this bit scaling law.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
We have examined the impact of quantized CDI on the secrecy rate achievable with AN-
assisted beamforming. In view of the AN leakage problem, we have analyzed the optimal power
allocation strategy to maximize the achievable secrecy rate under quantized CDI. Moreover, to
maintain a constant secrecy rate loss compared to the perfect CDI case, we have shown that the
number of feedback bits B must be scaled logarithmically with the transmission power P for
both the MISOSE and the MIMOME cases. The presented simulation results have confirmed
our analytical results.

Since he ∼ CN (0, IMt), from [20, Chapter 5] we know that |hegˆr|2 and ‖heNgˆr‖2 are
independent and distributed as v2 and v2Mt−2, respectively, where vk is chi-square distributed
with degree of freedom k. Hence, it follows that

where the last equality follows by v2Mt−2/(2(Mt − 1)) a.s.→ 1 as Mt → ∞ from the law of large
numbers (LLN). Then, eq. (12) follows by evaluating the expectation over v2. 

where (a) follows from the fact that 0 ≤ γgˆ⊥r P <  under event A and that 1 − α < 1, (b)

that |grgˆHr |2 = cos2 θ ≥ 1 − δ = 1 − 2−
B
Mt−1 (which follows from the QCA model in (4)).
Moreover, with the fact that ‖hr‖2/Mt a.s.−→ 1 as Mt → ∞ (which follows by the LLN), we
also have from (14) that γgˆ⊥r = ‖hr‖

1/Mt approaches 0. Then (39) becomes

Now, let us prove that α < αw + u. Similarly, by (15), we can write
d(α) = E
[
γgˆrP (γgˆ⊥r P + 1)(1− α)

where the last inequality comes from the fact that α > αw − l proven previously. Since
Pr (A) → 1 as Mt → ∞, the second term in (41) can be made arbitrarily small for Mt
sufficiently large. Hence, it follows that, for Mt sufficiently large,
d(α) < E

inequality into (46) gives rise to (21). Theorem 1 is then proved. 
E. Proof of Theorem 2
Basically, we modify [2, Appendix B] to reach (49) and derive new results based on (49).
First, let us define yˆnr ={yˆr[i]}ni=1, yˆne ={yˆe[i]}ni=1 and sn={s[i]}ni=1. By Definition 1, for any ε′ > 0
and n > n0, the achievable secrecy rate Rˆ can be upper bounded as
nRˆ− nε′ < H(w|yˆne ,hnr ,hne )
(a)
≤ I(w; yˆnr |yˆne ,hnr ,hne ) + nε1
(b)
≤ I(sn; yˆnr |yˆne ,hnr ,hne ) + nε1, (47)
where (a) follows from Fano’s inequality for any ε1 > 0 and sufficiently large n [2], and (b)
follows from the Markov relation w ↔ sn ↔ (yˆnr , yˆne ). According to the channel model in (7)
and (8), it can be shown [2] that
I(s; yˆr|yˆe,hr = h˜r,he = h˜e) = [I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)− I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+ (48)
for a certain fading state (h˜r, h˜e). With (47) and (48), and by following [2] we have
Rˆ ≤
∫ ∫
[I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)−I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+N(h˜r, h˜e)
n
dh˜rdh˜e+ε2, (49)
where ε2 = ε1+ ε′ and N(h˜r, h˜e) denotes the number of times for which the channel (hr,he) is
in fading state (h˜r, h˜e) over the n channel uses. Notice that, for a given channel state (h˜r, h˜e), (7)
and (8) is equivalent to a scalar Gaussian wiretap channel, and therefore [I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he =
h˜e) − I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+ in (49) is maximum with Gaussian s (see [21]). Then, as
[2], we denote the average power of s[i] and a[i] over the channels (hr[i],he[i]) = (h˜r, h˜e) in
n channel uses as P ns and P na , respectively. It is easy to see that
[I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)− I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+

For Mt and P sufficiently large and by applying the inequality E1(x)ex < ln(1+xx ) [15] along
with (12), the achievable secrecy rate in (9) can be lower-bounded by
Rˆ(α)>E

where ε′2 > 0 goes to zero when Mt goes to infinity. The last inequality of (57) come as follows.
Apply the LLN on |hr‖

Mt−1 , we know that event A happens when {cot2 θ < (1 − α)P − 1} for
Mt large enough. If we choose P satisfying (1− α)P > 2/δ, from the PDF of cot2 θ [7]

.
With large Mt and fixed η  B/Mt, the RHS of the above inequality can be made arbitrary
small. Moreover, using the methods under (44), Pr(A) ≥ 1− (1/2)Mt−1, then
E

With large Mt, the second term in the RHS of (59) approaches to zero. Then from (58) and
(59), we can prove the final inequality of (57).

遇到許多國內和國外的友人，例如：University of Southern California的 Prof. C.-C. Jay
Kuo、KAIST University的 Prof. Youngchul Sung、台灣大學的陳光禎教授、鍾嘉德教授和
蘇炫榮教授等，期待未來能有更進一步的互訪或者是合作的機會。本次會議的主題包含
非常的廣，在參與會議的過程中，有機會對於非自己專長的其他領域有更多的認識，也
有機會與許多國際學者面對面的接觸。這次的會議以亞洲的學者為主，台灣參加的人數
很多，讓在亞洲從事相關領域研究的人員有互相交流的平台，也更增加區域性的凝聚力。
本次在會議中發表的論文名為“Channel-Aware Reservation-Based MAC Protocol for
Cognitive Radio Networks”。在此論文中，我們考量一個具有通道感知能力的系統，探討
使用者如何利用通道狀態資訊來做通道使用預約，並分析系統整體傳輸效能。在場的鍾
嘉德教授並提出有關 multichannel系統的延伸研究，是我們未來將持續探討的議題。
這次的學術會議是啟動 APSIPA這個新學會的活動。雖然是此學會第一次舉辦的會
議，但是因為有很多亞洲重要人士的參與，使得此次會議籌辦的很成功，也相信未來將
更加茁壯。建議台灣學者未來都能熱心的參與。
