Application of Dynamic Neural Network Model for Nonlinear System 
Identification and Control 
 
Abstract 
The Hopfield neural network (HNN) has been widely discussed for controlling a 
nonlinear dynamical system. The weighting factors in HNN will be tuned via the 
Lyapunov stability criterion to guarantee the convergence performance. The proposed 
architecture in this paper is high-order Hopfield-based neural network (HOHNN), in 
which additional inputs from functional link net for each neuron are considered. 
Compared to HNN, the HOHNN performs faster convergence rate. The simulation 
results for both HNN and HOHNN show the effectiveness of HOHNN controller for 
affine nonlinear system. It is obvious from the simulation results that the performance 
for HOHNN controller is better than HNN controller. 
 
1. Introduction 
The Hopfield neural network (HNN) consists of a set of neuron and a corresponding 
set of unit delays forming a multiple-loop feedback system where the number of 
feedback loops is equal to the number of neurons. The HNN proposed in 1982 [1] has 
been adopted for pattern recognition [2], and image processing [3] in recent years. 
Neural networks, like HNNs, are suitable for controlling nonlinear dynamical systems 
due to their learning and memorizing capabilities. 
Functional link net methodology was first proposed in 1989 [4, 5] which have been 
combined with the neural network to create the high-order neural networks (HONNs). 
The input pattern of a functional link net an expansion of original input variables in 
HNN. There have been many considerable interests in exploring the applications of 
functional link model to deal with nonlinearity and uncertainties. The advantages of 
high-order functional link net have been shown in [6], in which the efficiency of 
supervised learning is not only greatly improved, but a flat net without hidden layer is 
also capable enough of doing the same job. However the functional link neural 
networks in [7] does not include the Hopfield neural network (HNN), and the 
weighting factors tuned via back-propagation algorithm can not guarantee the 
convergence of the nonlinear dynamical systems, especially in the real-time 
applications. 
In this paper, a new high-order Hopfield-based neural network (HOHNN) is proposed. 
It is basically a HNN with the compact functional link net and its exact analytical 
expression is also proposed. The application of HOHNN controller is explored in this 
paper to show the advantages of extra inputs for each neuron in HOHNN. A 
Lyapunov-based tuning algorithm is then proposed to find the optimal weighting 
matrix of HOHNN controller to achieve favorable approximation error. Furthermore, 
the convergence analysis with tuning weighting factors in the HOHNN controller is

The stability analysis of the above HNN has been proved in [8], in which an energy 
function was defined and it derivative function can be shown to be negative to yield 
an asymptotical stable system. 
 
3. The Compact Functional Link Net with HNN 
The functional link net is a single layer structure in which the hidden layer is removed. 
However, such functional transforms greatly increases the dimensions of input vector. 
Hence, it was suggested in [4] that high-order terms beyond the second-order term are 
not required in the enhanced patterns of input vector and the terms with two or more 
equal indices are also omitted. Therefore, a compact functional link net can be defined 
with rigorous formulae as shown in the following Fig. 2 and equations. The input 
pattern vector Z in Fig. 2 can be defined precisely as follows:
