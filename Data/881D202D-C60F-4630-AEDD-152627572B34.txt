22. Experimental
TiO2 nanotube was fabricated on ITO
glass by electrochemistry method. For all
samples discussed here we used ITO coated
glass substrates with a resistivity of 30Ti
film was deposited on ITO glass by RF
sputtering with titanium target. These Ti thin
films were anodized by a regulated dc power
supply with a mixed solution of 0.5% HF acid
and 3.5 % acetic acid. In the process of anode,
it is controlled at 50 °C, 20V, and 30mA to
make Ti films forming TiO2 nanotube under
electrolyte reaction for 10 minutes. Then the
TiO2 nanotube was annealed at 400°C ~ 700 °C
for 30 minutes in air. The experimental
flowchart for TiO2 nanotube is shown in Fig.1.
Structural analysis was carried out by X-ray
diffraction (XRD). The morphology and
microstructure of TiO2 nanotube was
characterized using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM). UV/vis absorption and
transmittance spectra were recorded on a UV
3310 spectrophotometer. Because ruthenium
complex sensitizers are very expensive, we
used a free-base porphyrin with carboxyl group,
5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl)
porphyrin (TCPP) as the sensitizer of solar cell.
The price of TCPP is about 1/50 of the
ruthenium-base sensitizers. TCPP was
purchased from porphyrin products (Logan, UT)
and used without further purification. All of the
organic materials were burned off during this
treatment and the electrode appeared pure
white. To adsorb TCPP onto the TiO2 electrode,
we soaked TiO2 nanotube in 2.5 ml of ethanolic
TCPP solution for 6 hr and baked in oven at
100 °C for 10 mins. The dye-sensitized solar
cell used for photovoltaic measurements
consisted of a dye-coated TiO2 electrode, a
counter electrode, and an organic liquid
electrolyte. The counter electrode was a Pt film
sputtered on an ITO-coated glass plate. The
I
-
/I3
-
electrolyte consisted of a mixture of
iodides and I2 (Wako Chemical) in acetonitrile
(AN, Kanto Chemical) with and without 0.5M
4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Aldrich). The two
electrodes were clipped together and a
cyanoacrylate adhesive was used as sealant to
prevent the electrolyte solution from leaking.
The current-voltage characteristics of samples
were measured by Keithley 2400 source meter
and determined under simulated sunlight with
white light intensity PL = 25 mW/cm2.
3. Results and discussion
Figure 2 shows X-ray diffraction patterns
of TiO2 nanotube sintered at various
temperatures. It is found that the TiO2 anatase
phase forms while the film is deposited. As
increasing the sintering temperature to 600 oC
(Fig. 2(d)), a small (110) peak of rutile phase
can be observed at 2~ 27.2o. If we increase the
sintering temperature to 700 oC, the TiO2
nanotube will turn to rutile phase completely.
The best anatase phase of TiO2 nanotube can be
observed in Fig. 2(c). It indicates that the best
sintering temperature of TiO2 nanotube is 500
oC. SEM images of the TiO2 nanotube annealed
at 500 oC are shown in Fig. 3. The diameter and
height of TiO2 nanotube are 70 nm and 230 nm,
respectively. The arrangement of TiO2 nanotube
is irregular, and the shape is also different.
Figure 4 is the transmittance of ITO glass
and TiO2 nanotube. It is found that the
transmittance of ITO glass is about 80%~90%
at 400~800 nm, while the non-annealed and
annealed TiO2 nanotube are 40% and
60%~70%. Figure 5 is the absorption spectra of
the non-annealed and annealed TiO2 nanotube.

 gaunidinium thiocyanate as self-assembly facilitating agent leading to improving in efficiency 
[8-11]. Some of the cheaper dyes have also been used as sensitizers. Porphyrin species, such as 
the chlorophyll derivatives and zinc porphyrin complex, have been investigated. These dyes show 
an efficient sensitive effect due to their strong absorption in the visible region [12-14]. In this 
research, a pillar titanium microstructure with controlled pillar size was formed by wet etching an 
titanium layer sputter-deposited on a ITO glass substrate in an acid solution [14,15].  After 
suitable annealing, TiO2 micro-pillars were fabricated and investigated by X-ray diffraction, 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, and current-voltage 
characteristics analyses to study the effects of TiO2 micro-pillars on the electrode of 
dye-sensitized solar cell.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
 
TiO2 thin films were deposited on ITO glass substrates about 80 nm thick by a RF sputter 
deposition system with a high purity (99.99%) titanium target. The films were deposited for 30 
minutes in a 200W power radio frequency discharge under an Ar (20 sccm) gas at the pressure of 
1.2×10-6 Torr. Then the TiO2 films was annealed at 500°C for 30 minutes in air. The TiO2 film 
was then photolithography processed using a designed pattern mask according to the following 
steps: high resolution positive photoresist was evenly coated onto the thin film using a spin coater 
at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds. The film was baked for half hour under 90°C followed by cleaning 
the residual solvent in the photoresist to increase adhesion. A mask was used to transfer the 
pattern design on the mask to the photoresist. Then the samples were etched in solutions 
containing HF, nitric acid and DI water  (1:1:2) for 50 seconds. After the etching process, the 
samples were rinsed with acetone and then dried in oven at 30°C. The morphology, structure, and 
optical properties of micro-pillars were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), and Ultraviolet-Visible spectrophotometer (UV/Vis spectrophotometer). The 
current-voltage characteristics of samples were measured by Keithley 2400 source meter and 
determined under simulated sunlight with white light intensity PL = 25 mW/cm2. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of TiO2 micro-pillar sintered at various 
temperatures. It is found that the peaks of TiO2 anatase are formed while the annealing 
temperature is 300°, and the best anatase phase can be observed while the annealing temperature 
is 500°C. If we increase the sintering temperature to 600 °C, the phase of TiO2 will turn to rutile. 
SEM image of the micro-pillar is shown in Fig. 2. It is reveals that the pillar structure is 
obviously observed and the average diameter size of micro-pillar is about 3 μm. 
 Figure 3 shows the absorption spectra of the TiO2 micro-pillar. It is revealed that annealed 
micro-pillars absorb well then non-annealed sample at ultraviolet region. The absorption band of 
annealed TiO2 micro-pillar shifts to a short wavelength, and the best absorption is at 370 nm. The 
TCPP absorbed micro- pillar has the best absorption spectrum then the others.

micro-pillar electrode. 
 
The current-voltage characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells with TiO2 film and TiO2 
micro-pillar electrodes are shown in Fig. 4 and listed in Table 1. We can observe that the short 
circuit current density (Isc) is 0.66 mA, the open circuit potential (Voc) is 0.54 V, the fill factor is 
42%, and the efficiency η is 0.6 % for the dye-sensitized solar cell with TCPP/TiO2 micro-pillar 
electrode. These values are obviously higher than those of TiO2 film electrode. These results 
reveal that the annealed TiO2 micro-pillar can be applied on the electrode of dye-sensitized solar 
cell to increase the contact area between TiO2 and dye, resulting in the enhancement of efficiency 
for dye-sensitized solar cell.

2個時段，在這裡卻是可以一直到會議結束。除了發表時間的長短不同之外，門禁
也是超深嚴的，凡是沒有註冊領名牌的人都會被兩個高大管門禁的義大利人給攔
下來，這跟我們台灣熱熱鬧鬧辦研討會的景象大不相同，至少會場外的地方是可
以讓沒註冊的人看看，也許是因為研討會的註冊費收得較高所致。
二、與會心得
這次到義大利參加第二屆國際陶瓷(international conference on ceramic)
研討會，和台灣相比其時差有六小時，而且飛行時間高達14 小時，去回坐飛機
的時間都覺得像是在熬夜一天一樣。研討會的地點在義大利偏北部的城市
Verona(唯農那)，它是一座古城，也是浪漫愛情故事羅密歐與朱麗葉的家鄉，事
實上義大利的城市大都是歷史悠久的古城，而且都在我們的教科書歷史課本中學
過、看過，像是羅馬(Roma)—經典名句是：『羅馬不是一天造成的』，有水都之
稱的威尼斯(Venice)，國際流行時尚的代表米蘭(milan)，建築界的傳奇—比薩
(pisa)斜塔等。
這次在我們參加研討會的時間，正是義大利人放假一個月的時間，讓我們覺
得驚訝的是，為何可以放假一個月好好休息一番，而且還是義大利政府法令規定
的，這義大利人的福利可真是讓我們羨慕不已。和台灣人比起來，擁有歷史悠久、
文化遺產資源豐富的義大利人，因重視休閒所以工作效率不是很好，開車也是亂
按喇叭！耐心也許也不太夠，在工作態度上台灣人還是較積極進取，換一個角度
想，也許我們命比較不好。
每次出國，身在不是故鄉的地方，我都深深感受到語文的重要，當然到任何
國家英文不見得都可以萬用，但多少總是在國際場合上適用，所以呢？好好加強
英文會話能力是出國參加研討會必須的，否則會寸步難行，而且碰到不是很有耐
心外國人更常常會發生誤會。

ABSTRACT 
 
In this research, TiO2 micro-pillars are fabricated on ITO glass by wet etching technology to 
be used as an electrode of dye-sensitized solar cell, and investigated by X-ray diffraction, 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, and current-voltage 
characteristics analyses. X-ray diffraction shows the best TiO2 anatase phase forms while 
sintering at 500° C for 30 min. SEM image reveals that the diameter and height of TiO2 pillars is 
3μ and 1μ, respectively. The absorption band of TiO2 micro-pillar shifts to a short wavelength, 
and the best absorption is at 370 nm. The results of ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and 
current-voltage characteristics reveal that this TiO2 micro-pillars electrode can increase the 
contact area between TiO2 and dye, resulting in the enhancement of efficiency for dye-sensitized 
solar cell. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Recently, a new type of solar cell based on dye-sensitized nano-crystalline titanium dioxide 
has been developed by Grätzel and coworkers [1]. Dye-sensitized solar cells based on 
nano-crystalline TiO2 electrodes are currently attracting widespread attention as a low cost 
alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices [2-6]. The function of such devices is 
based upon the injection of an electron from a photo-excited state of the sensitizer dye into the 
conduction band of the semiconductor. Using the ruthenium bipyridyl complex as a sensitizer, 
high quantum efficiencies have been obtained and overall energy conversion efficiencies have 
been increased to 11% [7]. In addition, Gratzel et al. used DSSC sensitized with N3 using
