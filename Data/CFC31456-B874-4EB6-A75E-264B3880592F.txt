1. Introduction
In the last few decades, the microwave-based wireless communications industry has been
revolutionized by using the ceramic dielectric materials to reduce the size and the cost of
components in circuit systems due to their unique electrical properties. In particular, size reduction
is mainly a result from the use of high-dielectric-constant material since the wavelength () in
dielectrics is inversely proportional to r according to the relation ro  , where o is the
wavelength in vacuum. However, as the frequency of interest is extended from ISM (industrial,
scientific and medical) bands to millimeter wave range, materials with high dielectric constant tend
to become a less of interest.1 Consequently, high quality factor together with low dielectric constant
would play a more prominent role instead, since high quality factor can significantly reduce the
dielectric loss and low dielectric constant which allows a fast time for electronic signal transition at
ultra high frequencies. Zero f is also one of the major requirements for dielectric materials to be
utilized as a frequency-stable passive component. The most convenient and promising way to
achieve a zero f is to combine two compounds having negative and positive f values to form
a solid solution or mixed phases.2-3 However, high dielectric constant materials exhibit high
dielectric loss (low Qu×f value) and large positive f 4-5, while low loss ceramics are usually
accompanied by low r value and negative f 4, 6-7. Consequently, it becomes a trade off problem
when mixing two compounds having opposite f values. For instance, mixing MgTiO3 ( r = 17,
Qu×f ~160,000 GHz, f ~ -50 ppm/oC) and CaTiO3 ( r = 170, Qu×f ~3,600 GHz, f ~ 800
ppm/oC) would lead to a compromised combination of dielectric properties ( r = 21, Qu×f ~56,000
2. Experimental procedure
The starting materials were high-purity oxide powders (>99.9%): Al2O3, ZnO and TiO2. The
powders were prepared with the desired stoichiometry (1-x)ZnAl2O4–xTiO2 and the mixtures were
ground in distilled water for 6 h in a ball mill with agate balls. The powders were dried and calcined
at 1100oC for 4 h in air. Prepared powders were re-milled for 12 h, together with 5 wt% of a 10%
PVA solution as a binder (Polyvinyl alcohol 500, Showa, made in Japan), and pressed into pellets
with 11mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness. All samples were prepared by using an automatic
uniaxial hydraulic press at 200 MPa. These pellets were sintered at 1270 ~ 1510oC for 4 h in air.
The crystalline phases of the sintered ceramics were identified by XRD using Cu Kα(λ=
0.15406 nm) radiation with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Munich, Germany) operated at 40 KV
and 40 mA. The microstructural observation and analysis of sintered surface were performed using
a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Philips XL_40FEG, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) and an
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The apparent densities of the sintered pellets were
measured by the Archimedes method. The dielectric constant ( r) and the quality factor values (Q)
at microwave frequencies were measured using the Hakki-Coleman dielectric resonator method.17-18
A system combining a HP8757D network analyzer and a HP8350B sweep oscillator (Palo Alto, CA)
was employed in the measurement. For temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ), the
technique is the same as that of quality factor measurement. The temperature coefficient of resonant
frequency (f) at microwave frequencies was measured in the temperature range from 25 to 80oC
and is defined by:
can be grouped into two types; larger grains (Spot A) are identified as TiO2 and smaller ones (Spot
B) are represented as ZnAl2O4 phase (Table 1). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the result indicates that the
specimen does not appear dense and the grain is not grown at 1330C. In addition, the grain size
increases as the sintering temperature increases. The pores are almost eliminated for specimen
sintered at 1360C, and a noticeable grain growth and a relatively uniform surface morphology are
observed at 1390C. However, inhomogeneous grain growth is monitored at temperatures higher
than 1390C, which might degrade the microwave dielectric properties of the ceramics. The melting
points of TiO2 and ZnAl2O4 are 1830C and 1980C, respectively. Sintering temperature of a
ceramic is normally 75% of its melting point.19 According to this rule, the sintering temperatures of
TiO2 and ZnAl2O4 should be around 1373C and 1485C, respectively. Either way, a lower firing
temperature for TiO2 is demonstrated. It implies that over heating the specimen may lead to an
over-grown TiO2 grain, which would result in an abnormal grain growth. Moreover, by taking the
apparent size difference in grains into consideration, a mixture of two phases along with an
appropriate ratio could effectively hold back the abnormal grain growth as result of a rapid grain
growth.20-21 These explained the average grain size of TiO2 in our experiment was smaller than that
reported by Lei et al.10 under similar conditions. The micrographs of the specimens using
(1-x)ZnAl2O4–xTiO2 ceramics at 1390C/4 h are illustrated in Fig. 4. The introduction of ZnAl2O4
does inhibit the grain growth of TiO2. With the ratio of ZnAl2O4:TiO2 = 1:1, a relative uniform grain
growth could be achieved for specimen sintered at 1390C.
Fig. 5 demonstrates the relative density of the (1-x)ZnAl2O4–xTiO2 ceramics as a function of
divalent and trivalent dopant ions only, with an ionic radius in the range of 0.5–0.95 Å, resulted in a
TiO2 ceramic with an increased Q value.22 As indicated previously, Zn (radius of Zn2+ =0.74 Å) and
Al (radius of Al3+ =0.535 Å) were both detected in the TiO2 grains, implying the forming of high-Q
doped TiO2. Its Qu×f value could become as high as 50,000 GHz. Consequently, ZnAl2O4 and
high-Q TiO2 have comparable Qu×f values. Still, all of the compositions in the (1-x)ZnAl2O4–xTiO2
system have higher quality factors than those of the end members. Similar results were reported by
Surendran et al. and Lei et al. 9-10 In comparison with their results, compatible Qu×f values were
obtained for specimens with x= 0.1 and 0.3 at 1480–1510C. For x= 0.5 and 0.7, however, a
relatively high Qu×f was attained at 1390C due to a higher density as well as a more uniform
surface morphology, although it might also fall back to a lower Qu×f by increasing the sintering
temperature to 1480–1510C through interpolation. The maximum Qu×f value of 277,000 GHz was
obtained for 0.5ZnAl2O4–0.5TiO2 ceramics sintered at 1390C for 4 h. Densification of the
ceramics plays an important role in controlling the dielectric loss and same phenomenon has also
been shown for other microwave dielectric materials. The decrease in Qu×f at high temperatures is
mainly due to the low density. In conclusion, the Qu×f value of the (1-x)ZnAl2O4–xTiO2 ceramics is
mainly dominated by the density and the surface morphology.
Fig. 8 demonstrates the temperature coefficients of resonant frequency ( f ) of the
(1-x)ZnAl2O4–xTiO2 ceramics as a function of its sintering temperature for 4 h. The f is almost
independent of sintering temperature since there is no significant compositional change observed.
By increasing TiO2, the f value becomes linearly varied in a positive direction owing to a large
value of 277,000 GHz and a large f of 177 ppm/oC can be obtained for 0.5ZnAl2O4–0.5TiO2
ceramics sintered at 1390oC for 4 h. It can be employed as an appropriate f compensator for
dielectrics that require a low r, a high Qu×f, and a nearly zero f . By individually adding
MgTiO3 and Mg4Nb2O9 to the proposed f compensator, dielectrics with a Qu×f of as high as
210,000 GHz could be achieved. In comparison with FR4 and alumina, the filter using the
compensated dielectric not only shows a tremendous reduction in the insertion loss but also
demonstrates a significant reduction in its size.

二、與會心得
(1)晶體成長為電子與光電產業之上游，影響產業鍊之發展甚鉅；而磊晶、薄膜成長和化
學法成長等晶體成長技術也是電子或光電元件開發之必備工具。國內產業在原物料取
得上一直受制於國外廠商，例如多晶矽太陽能電池之矽基板；而晶體成長之機台設備
也多仰望國外設備商，常常以整廠(turn-key)的方式取得，在這方面的技術較缺乏。
國內的學術界過度追求所謂具有高深學術價值的論文，而在基礎工業應用的開發上較
少著墨；而業界過度短視近利，常常只希望直接取得現成的技術。因此，我們在這個
領域仍然落後許多。參與本會獲得相當多資訊，包括三五族半導體、二六族半導體、
氧化物等單晶基板之大尺寸製造與品質提升的方法等。其中部分日本廠商展示之
HVPE GaN/sapphire、ZnO，都是未來極具潛力之單晶基板。
(2)奈米晶體之合成與成長亦是本會議重要之主題，其中尤以氧化物之奈米結構為主，例
如氧化鋅和氧化鈦重奈米晶體之應用， 因此與會獲得之晶體成長方法與技術對未來
研究幫助頗大。
