ABSTRACT 
 
This research aims to characterize the 
nonlinear rate-dependent behaviors of 
graphite/epoxy composites using 
micromechanical analysis.  In the analysis, 
the graphite fibers were considered as elastic 
solids, while the surrounding epoxy matrix 
exhibiting rate sensitivities was described 
using the three-parameter viscoplasticity 
model.  By using Aboudi’s generalized 
method of cells (GMC), the incremental 
form of the constitutive relations of the 
composites was expressed in terms of the 
constituent properties as well as the 
geometry parameters of the representative 
volume element (RVE).  After a numerical 
iteration, the corresponding stress and strain 
relations of composites at different strain 
rates were generated.  In order to verify the 
model predictions, off-axis graphite/epoxy 
composite specimens were tested at strain 
rates from 10-4/s to 550/s.  For strain rates 
less than 1/s, the experiments were 
conducted using a hydraulic MTS machine 
while high strain rate tests were carried out 
using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar.  
Experimental results indicate that the stress 
and strain curves are quite sensitive to the 
strain rate; moreover, when the strain rates 
increase, the material stiffens.  A 
comparison of model predictions with 
experimental results indicates that the 
rate-dependent behaviors of composites can 
be characterized effectively with the GMC 
model in conjunction with the viscoplastic 
properties of epoxy.   
 
Keywords: strain rate, graphite/epoxy 
composites, viscoplasticity, micro- 
mechanical analysis, generalized method of 
cell (GMC). 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Composite materials, because of their 
high strength-to-weight ratio, have been 
extensively used not only in aerospace 
industries but also in marine and automotive 
industries.  In some applications, such as 
blast loading of a submarine hull and bird 
 3
conditions at a strain rate up to 0.01/min.  
The PEEK matrix is described by the 
Chaboche model, and the composite 
behaviors are predicted using GMC.  
Nevertheless, the corresponding strain rates 
in their investigations are not high enough 
for engineering applications. 
The objective of this study is to propose 
a systematic characterization of the high 
strain rate responses of graphite/epoxy 
composites using the micromechanical 
approach in conjunction with the 
rate-dependent behaviors of the epoxy 
matrix.  The rate sensitivities of the epoxy 
phase is described by a simple constitutive 
model proposed based on low strain rate 
tests.  In addition, the graphite fiber is 
assumed to be a transverse isotropic solid 
[13].  With the corresponding ingredient 
properties, the constitutive behaviors of 
graphite/epoxy composites at various strain 
rate ranges were generated using the GMC 
micromechanical model.  In order to verify 
the model predictions, off-axis 
graphite/epoxy composites were tested at 
strain rates that range from 10-4/s to 550/s.   
 
MICROMECHANICAL ANALYSIS 
 
In the micromechanical analysis, a 
RVE suitable for representing the overall 
microstructures of the composites has to be 
selected initially.  In the first year report, 
two different RVEs as shown in Figure 1 
and Figure 2, respectively were proposed to 
denote the mechanical behaviors of the fiber 
composites.  One is the square fiber 
enclosed with coarse meshes, on the other 
hand, the other is the round fiber included 
with fine meshes.  In the GMC analysis, the 
more subcells is accounted for, the more 
computation time is required.  If the round 
fiber in the composites can be approximated 
by a square one with a cross-section equal to 
that of the circular fiber, the computations 
necessary can be dramatically reduced.  To 
validate this approximation, the stress and 
strain curves generated based on the two 
RVEs using GMC analysis will be compared 
in the following section. 
GMC Micromechanical Model 
 
When a RVE is selected in GMC 
analysis, it is usually divided into γβ NN ×  
subcells as shown in Figure 3.  Based on 
the displacement continuity as well as the 
traction continuity on the interface of the 
adjacent subcells in conjunction with the 
periodicity condition of the RVE, the 
relation between overall strain rates and the 
subcell strain rates is expressed as [7] 
 
ηAη VPs =            (1) 
 
where ( ) ( ) ( ){ } η,,η,η η γβNN1211s L=  
represents the collections of the strain rates 
for all subcells, and ( )121323332211 η2,η2,η2,η,η,ηη =  
indicates the overall strain rates of the RVE.  
It is noted that VPA  is a 6 γβNN ×6 matrix 
containing the geometry parameters of the 
RVE and the associated subcells.  The 
VPA  matrix can be partitioned into the 
γβNN  entries, and each entry represents a 
6×6 square matrix as

OFF-AXIS COMPRESSION TESTS 
 
In an effort to verify the model 
predictions, off-axis block PPG 
graphite/epoxy composite specimens were 
tested at various strain rates.  For high 
strain rate tests, experiments were conducted 
using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar.  
Alternatively, lower strain rate experiments 
were performed using the hydraulic MTS 
machine. 
 
Preparation of Graphite/Epoxy 
Composite Specimens 
 
Off-axis block specimens of 0.6 x 0.6 x 1 cm 
with fiber orientations of 15, 30, 45 and 60 
degrees were cut from a 45-ply 
unidirectional PPG graphite/epoxy laminate 
using a diamond wheel.  The PPG 
graphite/epoxy composites consisting of 
HTA-12K fiber (Toho, Japan) were provided 
by Ad-group, Taiwan.  In order to reduce 
contact friction between the specimen and 
the loading frame, the block specimens were 
lapped on a lapping machine with 14.5 μm 
abrasive slurry and also lubricated during the 
tests.  In general, the lapping and 
lubricating process work well for 
glass/epoxy composites to reduce contact 
friction.  However, for graphite/epoxy 
composites, because of the stiffer graphite 
fiber, contact friction is difficult to be 
reduced effectively by the lapping process, 
resulting in non-homogeneous deformation 
during off-axis compression tests.  In order 
to significantly diminish the contact friction, 
more surface treatments on the loading faces 
are required for the graphite/epoxy 
composites.  Bing and Sun [15] suggest 
that in addition to lapping and lubricating, 
surface coating with a thin titanium film on 
graphite/epoxy specimens may be effective 
in lessening friction.  Therefore, all off-axis 
graphite/epoxy specimens were coated with 
approximately 1.2 μm titanium film on the 
loading surfaces using sputtering 
technology. 
 
Low Strain Rate Tests 
 
Low strain rate testes were conducted 
on the off-axis block specimens using the 
stroke control mode on a servo-hydraulic 
MTS machine (MTS 810 system).  
Basically, the experimental setup is the same 
as that used for testing epoxy specimens.  
Three different nominal strain rates of 10-4/s, 
10-2/s and 1/s were implemented for testing 
the off-axis graphite/epoxy composite 
specimens.  The corresponding true strain 
histories were measured by strain gages 
which were adhered back to back to the 
specimens; concurrently, the applied load 
histories were evaluated through load cells 
mounted onto the loading frame.  Stress 
and strain signals were recorded both by 
LabView and personal computer. 
 
High Strain Rate Tests 
 
The high strain rate compression tests 
were performed on the off-axis block 
specimens using a Split Hopkinson Pressure 
Bar (SHPB), a simple and effective 
apparatus for dynamic testing.  Figure 6 
shows the schematic of a conventional 
SHPB setup made of hardened steel bars 13 
mm in diameter.  The striker bar was 9.2 
cm long, and the incident bar and 
transmission bar were 92 cm and 58 cm long, 
respectively.  A pair of diametrically 
opposite gages (gage A) was mounted on the 
incident bar to measure both the incident and 
reflection signals.  On the transmission bar, 
strain gages (gage B) were mounted about 
29 cm from the specimen interface to 
measure the transmitted pulse.  The 
dimensions of the composite specimens for 
SHPB tests were the same as those used in 
low strain rate tests.  The strain-gaged 
block specimens were sandwiched between 
the incident bar and the transmission bar, 
and the strain history of the specimen was 
obtained directly from the strain gages 
mounted on the specimen.  The strain gages 
which were adhered to the specimen and 
bars, respectively, were connected to 
Wheatstone circuits and then amplified.  A 
 7
the epoxy changed as a result of the 
interaction of the fibers and the polymer 
molecules.  Although the implementation 
of the bulk epoxy properties may result in 
some deviations, this investigation can 
provide an indication of how rate-dependent 
behaviors of epoxy resin influence the 
mechanical responses of fiber composites, 
especially at high strain rate ranges. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The behaviors of graphite/epoxy 
composites were characterized using the 
GMC micromechanical model together with 
the rate-dependent behaviors of epoxy.  
The rate sensitivities of the epoxy resin were 
described using a three-parameter 
viscoplasticity model written in the form of 
power law.  In the GMC analysis, it was 
found that the representative volume 
elements containing square fibers in square 
array exhibit the same constitutive relations 
as that with round fibers.  To validate the 
model predictions, off-axis graphite epoxy 
composites were tested in compression at 
various strain rates using a conventional 
hydraulic MTS machine as well as the split 
Hopkinson Pressure Bar.  Although some 
discrepancies existed between the model 
predictions and experimental data, it was 
concluded that the micromechanical 
approach developed is applicable to the 
establishment of a constitutive relation of 
graphite/epoxy composites at a strain rate up 
to 550/s.

Effect of Organoclay on Mechanical Properties of Glass/Epoxy Nanocomposites: 
Tensile, Flexure and Interlaminar Fracture Properties 
 
 
 
Jia-Lin Tsai and Ming-Dow Wu 
 
 
 
organoclay platelet is an ultra thin (1 nm) silicate film with lateral dimensions up to 
1μ m.  Through the ion exchange process, the sodium ions attracted on the surfaces of 
the platelets were replaced with organic cations which can not only improve the 
interfacial adhesion between the polymer and the platelet but also facilitate the 
exfoliation of the organoclay.  After an appropriate fabrication process, such as melt 
compounding [5], in situ polymerization [6, 7] and solution method [8], the aggregated 
platelets can be exfoliated and dispersed uniformly in the polymer.  Depending on the 
degree of exfoliation, three categories of nanocomposites, i.e., tactoid, intercalated and 
exfoliated, were produced [9].  Experimental observations show that the stiffness of 
nanocomposites will be enhanced appreciably if the platelets are well dispersed and 
exfoliated in the nanocomposites [5, 10].   
Although the mechanical behaviors of nanocomposites can be increased by 
organoclay, as compared to the conventional fiber composites, the amount of 
enhancement is still limited.  To be applicable for structural applications, the hybrid 
fiber/organoclay nanocomposites, combining the characteristics of the long fiber 
composites and the organoclay nanocomposites, were then synthesized.  Haque et al. 
[11] fabricated the glass/epoxy composites and glass/epoxy nanocomposites with low 
loading of organoclay.  They pointed out that dispersion of 1 wt% organoclay could 
improve the interlaminar shear strength of glass/epoxy nanocomposites up to 44%.  
Similar positive tendency on the flexure properties of the laminates with organoclay 
were also observed by Kornmann et al [12].  Chowdhury et al [13] studied the flexural 
and thermo-mechanical properties of woven carbon carbon/nanoclay epoxy laminates 
pointing out that the maximum flexural strength and modulus as well as the highest Tg 
value appear at the samples with 2wt% nanoclay loading.  Miyagawa et al [14] 
investigated the organoclay effect on flexural properties and the interlaminar shear 
strength (ILSS) of bio-based epoxy carbon fiber composites.  It was found that the 
flexural strength and the modulus are not influenced substantially by the organoclay.  In 
addition, little improvement on the ILSS was observed on the 5wt% organoclay 
samples.  Vlasveld et al. [15] conducted single fiber fragmentation test to evaluate the 
fiber-matrix interfacial bonding properties of the glass fiber reinforced polymide-6 
silicate nanocomposites.  It was revealed that the interfacial bonding decreases with the 
inclusion of silicate into the matrix materials, which deviates from the early 
investigations provided by other researches [11-13].  This discrepancy could be due to 
the processing effect resulting in the changes of the microstructures of the 
nanocomposites.  So far, the information related to the effect of organoclay on the 
mechanical responses of fiber/epoxy composites is still lacking. 
In this study, a systematic investigation was carried out to understand the 
organoclay effect on the tensile, flexural and fracture behavior of glass fiber reinforced 
nanocomposites.  Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observations were conducted 
on the failure surfaces to determine the failure mechanism.

[0]5 tension 
 
The tensile strength and the Young’s modulus of the nanocomposites with 
different organoclay loading were evaluated from the peak values and the initial slope 
(0.1% strain) of the stress-strain curves of the [0]5 specimens, respectively.  Since it is 
fiber dominated properties, the stress-strain curve is linear and the sudden failure occurs 
as the ultimate strength is reached.  Figures 1 and 2 illustrate Young’s modulus and 
longitudinal tensile strength with respective to different organoclay loadings. At least 
five specimens were tested for each case.  It is found that the Young’s modulus is not 
affected significantly by the organoclay; however, the failure stresses are declining as 
the organoclay loading increases.  In general, the tensile strength is fiber dominant 
property and should not be influenced by the matrix.  It is noted that the fibers adopted 
for the study are stitched together by means of the woven threads which may cause the 
wavy fibers to occur in the nanocomposites.  When the samples with the wavy fibers are 
tested in the fiber direction, the failure mechanism may not be dominated by the fiber 
breakages.  Apparently, for the nanocomposites, the fiber brooming instead of 
breakages was found on the failure [0]5 specimens.  In addition, when the epoxy matrix 
is modified with the organoclay, the mechanical response become brittle and the 
fracture toughness decreases accordingly [16].  As a result, the effect of wavy fibers in 
conjunction with the brittle behaviors of the matrix should be responsible for the 
decreases of the tensile strength of nanocomposites.

[10]5 tension 
 
In view of the forgoing, the interfacial adhesion between the glass fibers and the 
surrounding matrix could be improved by the organoclay.  This implies that the in-plane 
shear strength of nanocomposites which is dominated by the interfacial properties could 
also be enhanced accordingly.  To validate the organoclay effect, the in-plane shear 
strength of fiber composites were measured from off-axis 10o specimens and the 
[ 45± ]s laminates as well [18].   The 10o specimens will be introduced in this section 
and the [ 45± ]s laminates  will be presented in the next section.   It is noted that in the 
10o specimens, the tensile stress is always accompanied with the in-plane shear stress on 
the failure plane resulting in that the in-plane shear strength measured from 10o 
specimens is relatively low as compared to that obtained from [ 45± ]s. and considered 
as the lower bound solution.  The in-plane shear strength obtained from the off-axis 10o 
specimens are plotted in Figure 6 corresponding to different organoclay loadings.  It is 
 
 
 
Moreover, it is found that the in-plane shear strength obtained from [ 45± ]s  laminate 
increases as the organoclay contents increase, which is consistent with that measured in 
[10]5 specimens.  It should be noted that in the failure mechanism of the [ 45± ]s  
laminate is matrix failure which can be verified by the failure specimens as shown in 
Figure 9.

Three Point Bending Flexure Tests 
 
The effect of organoclay on the flexural properties of the glass fiber reinforced 
composites was determined from the three point bending test in accordance with ASTM 
standard D790 [19].   During the tests, the crosshead is under stroke control and the 
corresponding speed is set to be 0.07mm min-1.   The flexural strength of the specimens 
is calculated from the following formulation

Mode I Fracture Test 
 
In addition to the tensile and flexural properties presented earlier, the effect of 
organoclay on the interlaminate fracture toughness of glass/epoxy nanocomposites was 
determined from double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens.  The DCB specimens were 
12-ply unidirectional laminates with a porous film inserted in the mid-plane during the 
lay-up process for creating the pre-crack.  The dimension of specimen is 230mm long, 
20mm wide and 3.3mm in thickness.  Symmetric loadings applied in the opposite 
directions were transferred into the cracked end of the specimens through a pair of 
hinge bonded on the specimen surfaces resulting in the Mode I crack extension.  During 
the tests, the crosshead speed is set to be 0.5 mm/min.  All specimen preparations and 
experimental procedure were performed based on ASTM standard D5528-01 [20].  The 
fracture toughness was calculated using the modified beam theory [21]

where P is the load when crack begin to propagate and δ is the displacement associated 
with the load P, B is the width and a is the initial crack length of the specimen.   In the 
conventional beam theory, the fracture toughness was calculated based on the 
assumption that the specimen is clamped at the delamination crack front.  However, in 
reality, the DCB specimen is not a perfectly built-in cantilever but exhibits rotation and 
deformation around the crack tip.  To compensate the deformation and ration effect, the 
beam theory was modified with a slightly longer crack length Δ+a , where Δ  can be 
evaluated experimentally from the plot of the cube root of compliance with respect to 
the crack length [21].  The interlaminar mode I fracture toughness of the 
nanocomposites calculated from the modified beam theory are plotted versus the 
organoclay loading in Figure 12.  In contrast to the in-plane shear strength and 
transverse tensile strength, the interlaminar fracture toughness of the nanocomposites
