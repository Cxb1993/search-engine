Abstract--- A new approach to determine the strain from fringe patterns by the 
implementation of optical Radon-Wigner display is proposed. The information of 
strain can be extracted from the space-frequency representation of the fringe 
patterns by locating the instantaneous frequency of the spectral energy maxima 
density. The performance of optical Radon-Wigner display as an excellent tool to 
obtain the space location of the strains is also presented. 
 
 
Keywords: Radon-Wigner display, fractional Fourier transform, strain 
 
 
 
The strains information can be extracted from the instantaneous frequency of the 
spectral energy maxima density by analyzing of fringe pattern in the space-frequency 
domain. Several techniques of fringe pattern analysis have been developed in literatures 
[1-6]. However, most of them have a common feature that analyzing of fringe pattern are 
based on the computer-assisted methodology. It is inconvenient to illustrate the 
information of strains directly. Motivated by this reason, we develop an optical 
implementation of the Radon-Wigner display to depict the information of strains 
promptly. To simplify the presentation, we use a 1-D description and assume the 
displacement information encoded in the fringe pattern is the displacement 
component )(xu . Following is the representation of the model [7]: 
 
)].(cos1[)( 0 xmIxI φ+=   (1) 
 
)(xI  denotes the intensity of a fringe for the point of coordinate x , 0I  is the 
illumination of background, and m  is the visibility of fringe. The relationship between 
the argument )(xφ  and the displacement field is,

where λ  is wavelength, z  is the distance between object and image plane, 
[ ] ααπ sin)24(exp −−= jA , 2pπα = , p  denotes the fractional order of the 
FrFT, and [ ]⋅pF  is the operation of fractional Fourier transform with fractional order p . 
For 1=p , the FrFT becomes the conventional Fourier transform, and for 0=p , the 
fractional domain is the input domain. The effect of FrFT is most easily seen in the 
time-frequency plane. Here, we use the Wigner distribution to illustrate the effect of the 
FrFT on a signal since it is one of the most popular time-frequency distributions and has 
many useful properties [9-14]. It is defined as

where u  denotes the frequency variable, and x  is the time or space variable. The 
Wigner distribution gives an idea of how the energy of a signal is distributed in time and 
frequency. The effect of the FrFT on the Wigner distribution of a signal is simply a 
clockwise rotation by an angle α  in the time-frequency. Another transform is also 
relative to the Wigner distribution called the Radon-Wigner transform (RWT) that is 
defined as the projection of the Wigner distribution function of signal at an arbitrary 
angle in phase space. The Radon-Wigner display (RWD) is a continuous two-dimensional 
display of the RWT for all the projection angles for one-dimensional signal. Hence, the 
RWD can be regarded as square modulus of a FrFT for all the fractional order p .  
If we can setup an optical implementation to perform the RWD then we could depict 
the information of strains promptly by analyzing of fringe pattern without 
computer-assisted methodology. We design an optical setup to perform the RWD based 
on Eqs. (3) and (4), as shown in Fig. 2. The authors may compare it with other setups 
proposed by previous literatures and then found to understand the foundation of RWD 
easily [9-16]. We do not try to mention it too much here. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed 
optical setup for implementation of the RWD.
