Abstract 
The α-β and α-β-γ filters based on the Kalman-like estimation scheme has been recognized as a outstanding 
tool for estimating the position, velocity and acceleration signals of moving objects. Nevertheless, the 
performance of estimation heavily depends on the parameters α, β and γ. In general, the choice of parameters 
is a trade-off optimization problem between the tracking accuracy and noise reduction capability. In order to 
obtain the suitable design of α-β and α-β-γ filters for some specifications, a combined fuzzy logic system and 
evolutionary optimization method is proposed for determining the decisive parameters. In addition, a new 
integral-type α-β-γ filter is proposed to provide the velocity signal based on the measured acceleration signal. 
The simulation results are employed to illustrate that the developed optimal filters are capable of tracking the 
desired signals accurately, and at the same time reducing the noise disturbance remarkably.

1. Introduction 
Motion control is a popular research topic during this notable decade of years. Various feedback control 
schemes have been proposed for linear and nonlinear systems. When practically implementing these control 
schemes, the exact and complete knowledge of system states is necessary. Unfortunately, not all the states can 
be measured due to the restricted sensors or the considerable cost. Therefore, various discrete-time estimation 
schemes have been devised for motion control in practical applications. 
Kalman filter is one of well-known and efficient methods for estimating the states of dynamic system from 
an incomplete and noisy measurement. Because its recursive algorithm, only the one-sample preceding data 
will be sufficient in the calculation. Nevertheless, the computation load is an excessive cost for practical 
implementation. For this reason, some simpler Kalman-like filters, namely α-β filter and α-β-γ filter, are 
usually considered when applied to the Newtonian systems. In literature, Sklansky [1], Benedict [2], Simpson 
[3], Neal [4], Kalata [5], Gray [6], Tenne [7] et al. published some of the earlier work on tracking filters for 
pointing commands in tracking radar.  
Even though there are many discussions about generalized parameters for α-β and α-β-γ filters, most 
developed schemes involve assuming known noise variance to formulate the optimal criteria. Little effort has 
been made about finding the optimal parameters under the condition of unknown noise variance. Therefore, 
the main aim of this study is to search the optimal parameters with the unknown noise variance, and devise a 
tuning strategy for α-β and α-β-γ filters possessing the adaptation capability. On the other hands, an α-β filter 
based integration algorithm is developed for providing velocity-type signals from acceleration-type 
measurements.

with zero mean and variance 2vσ . Once α-β filter is optimally designed to effectively reduce the covariance of 
estimation, which means the effect of the noise on the measurement is made less significant. Several criteria 
have been proposed as performance indices for the design of optimal fixed-gain filters. The most commonly 
used technique is to calculate the Variance Reduction Ratio (VRR). The VRR is defined as the ratio of output 
variance to input variance in steady-state when no input signals are fed into the estimation algorithm

2.2  α-β-γ filters 
Further, the α-β filter algorithm can be extended to a three-dimension estimation scheme which is called 
α-β-γ filter. The estimation processing of α-β-γ filters is related with fixed Kalman gains α, β, and γ. The

3. Fuzzy Gain Scheduled Optimization Method 
In light of the formulas of α-β and α-β-γ filters, we know that the maneuverability performance of filters 
depend on the values of parameters α, β and γ. Furthermore, the reductions of measurement noise determined 
by VRRs are also the functions of α, β and γ. We can conclude that the parameters of α-β and α-β-γ filters 
have opposite effects on the maneuverability performance and the noise variance reduction. This means we 
have to consider the determination of these parameters as a multi-objective optimization problem [9]-[14]. In 
this study, a fuzzy gain scheduled optimization method is proposed to provide a favorable alternative in search 
of optimal parameters. A further develop procedure is introduced in the next paragraph. 
As was shown in Fig. 1, there are four steps including in the fuzzy-based optimization method for the 
optimal design of α-β and α-β-γ filters. The detail of each steps have been enumerated as follows: 
Step 1. According to the optimization criteria introduced in [15], the dimension of multi-objective 
optimization problem for α-β and α-β-γ filters can be reduced via the parameter ζ, which is related to the 
fixed-gains α, β, and γ. For α-β and α-β-γ filters, the relationship functions of α, β, γ, and ζ are given by 
( )22 1,1 ξβξα −=−=  (9)
and  
( )( ) ( )323 1,115.1,1 ξγξξβξα −=−−=−=  (10)
respectively. The optimal design of ζ is equivalent to that of α, β, and γ. 
Step 2. In order to reduce the complexity of the optimization procedure, a weighted objective vector is 
utilized to transfer the multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective one. The weighted 
objective vector is defined as 
FFw W=  (11)
for the optimization procedure of α-β and α-β-γ filters, in which weighting coefficients are related to the 
sampling interval T. For α-β-γ filters, the weighted matrix W  and objective vector F are given by 
 
 8
where dξˆ  is the modified optimum parameter index for α-β and α-β-γ filters, and the increment ξΔ  is 
provided by fuzzy system. 
The structure of the developed fuzzy system is represented in Fig. 2. In the design procedure, we have to 
determine the relating and meaningful input variables, output values and inference rules for fuzzy systems to 
achieve the expectation. In addition to the filtering capability, the tracking accuracy has to be maintained in 
the optimal design of filters. First, we consider the estimation error and sampling interval as variables to 
decide the tracking performance, and then utilize VRR to indicate the noise reduction capability. The 
v_NVRRαβ  ( normalization of v_VRRαβ ) and x_x VRRERR αβ  are determined as two fuzzy input 
variables for α-β filters. The a_NVRRαβγ  ( normalization of a_VRRαβγ ) and x_x VRRERR αβγ  are the 
two fuzzy input variables for α-β-γ filters. The normalization equations are formulated as

optimal design of α-β and α-β-γ filters are, respectively, established in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

applications. These results indicate that the parameters for α-β filter need to be adjusted for fitting the specific 
situation. By the developed optimization method, the parameters α, and β are real-time adapted to provide 
better estimation results. With the average values of optimum parameters, 2832.0=α  and 0235.0=β , the 
improved estimation results depicted in the last 4 second responses of Figs. 9-10 seem to be smooth and be 
capable to follow the desired signals. 
After the simulation test of the α-β filters, we exam the fuzzy gain scheduled optimization method for α-β-γ 
filters. With the assumption as previous, the estimation results of optimal designed α-β-γ filter are illustrated 
in Figs. 11-13. The average values of optimum parameters are 2849.0=α , 0318.0=β , and 0012.0=γ . 
Although the provided velocity and acceleration possess a little distortion and delay phenomenon, the 
estimated signals can be taken out from the high-interference signals is a rather complicated task. 
In order to demonstrate the developed optimization method is flexible and effective for α-β and α-β-γ filters 
within different situations. We do kinds of tests with SNR = 5, 15, 25 in the each case of T = 0.02, 0.05, and 
0.08. The simulation results of α-β filters and α-β-γ filters are collected in Tab. I and Tab. II, respectively. 
These results indicate that the proposed fuzzy based optimization method is indeed competent for providing 
the optimum parameters for α-β and α-β-γ filters. These optimal filters provide available estimation 
performances which achieve the largest noise reduction within an acceptable tracking effect. 
In addition, we make a comparison study between the proposed optimal designed α-β filter and fuzzy-gain 
filter which was proposed by Chan.[16]. In one comparison example, we define the desired signal as Eq. (18), 
T = 0.02, and SNR = 25. The error responses of the estimated position and velocity are depicted in Fig. 14 and 
Fig. 15, respectively. In the figures, the real-lines were provided by the developed optimal α-β filter, and 
dotted-lines were provided by fuzzy-gain filter. The relating average absolute error (AEE) of estimated signals 
are concluded in Tab. III. We can note that the designed optimal α-β filter by proposed fuzzy gain scheduled 
method demonstrated 36.52% improvement of velocity estimation compared to that using fuzzy-gain filter, in 
addition to the 4.72% improvement of position estimation. As shown in Figs. 16-17, the moving 
root-mean-square error (RMSE) responses with data length 10 are easy to perceive the contrast between the 
proposed method and fuzzy-gain filter. In order to verify the proposed optimal α-β filter is also superior in the 
simulation of low SNR, we do the compared examples with SNR = 15 and SNR =5. The comparison results 
are concluded in Tab. IV and Tab. V. Compared with the fuzzy-gain filter, the developed optimal α-β filter 
demonstrated 67.88% and 81.83% improvements of velocity estimation within SNR = 15 and SNR = 5, 
respectively, in addition to the 19.35% and 29.99% improvements of position estimation. With the statistics as 
illustrated in Fig. 18, we can notice that the estimation performance of proposed fuzz gain scheduled α-β filter 
has an obviously improvement as compared with the fuzzy-gain filter, especially in velocity signal. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, we have successfully designed optimal α-β and α-β-γ filters for the motion control. The 
designed filters based on the proposed fuzzy gain scheduled optimization method could be utilized to provide 
the unmeasured kinematic states which are necessary in the implementation of state feedback controllers. 
Unlike the derivative-based optimization methods, the proposed optimization algorithm is performed without 
a smooth objective function which is advantageous in the hardware realization. From the simulation results, 
we can find that the estimated signals are indeed smooth and available for the practical applications. By 
compare with fuzzy-gain filter proposed by Chan, the presented method provides the high improvement.
