high-end models. According to the estimation of 
DisplaySearch, for the entire 2010, 90% of LED 
backlight LCD TV will adopt edge type LED technology. 
The main reason for this is certainly the consideration of 
balance between the product price, and thinness and 
brightness requirements.  
But for product differentiation, many companies begin 
to adopt both edge type and direct type LEDs on their 
products from 2010. More specifically, basic LED 
backlight LCD TVs will use the edge type LED; the 
direct type LED, on the other hand, will be used on 
high-end models. However, it is expected that the direct 
type LED, due to its cost, is hard to become mainstream 
in short term, but it can be necessary for companies to 
arrange for high-end market.  
 
1.3 White LED and RGB LED Light Source 
LED backlights are currently being largely introduced 
to IT monitor products, and also have increasing quantity 
on the adoption of LED backlight for NB. It is mainly 
because of the energy-saving and mercury-free 
advantages of the LED. However, applying LED 
backlight on LCD TV was rarely referred to energy 
saving in the past, instead LED backlights were 
considered to consume much more power than CCFL 
type. The reason is that previous designs mostly adopted 
the less luminous efficient R, G, B tricolor LED with 
light sources all lit, plus over 2,000 LED chips are used 
in each design. Therefore the power consumption of this 
kind of designs is nearly 100W higher than CCFL type 
(using 40-inch level as an example).  
Current high efficiency LED backlight module designs 
adopt the more luminous efficient white LED (The 
luminous efficiency of the white LED is generally 80 
lm/W, but the efficiencies of R, G, and B are different. 
They are 40, 80, and 10 lm/W each.), and the number of 
LEDs used on the 40-inch LCD panel is half of the 
number when RGB LEDs were adopted. More 
importantly, because of the local dimming technology, 
the average power consumption of large-scale LCD 
panels could substantially reduce more than 50%.  
 
1.4 LED 2D Local Dimming Technology 
The so-called local dimming technology is the 
technology which lets the LCD backlight attain different 
brightness levels in each area of an LCD. Broadly 
speaking, local dimming can be divided into three types: 
0-dimension (0D), 1-dimension (1D), 2-dimension (2D) 
dimming; the corresponding backlights are in turn flat 
light (FFL and OLED), linear light CCFL (or EEFL 
which is similar to CCFL), and dot light LED. Among 
the three types of local dimming above, 2D dimming 
produces the best result of local dimming. 
Why does LED produce the best result of local 
dimming of all current backlights? Because the flat light 
either lights up or darken the entire panel, it cannot attain 
different levels of brightness on each small area of an 
LCD panel; the CCFL or EEFL are linear lights, a 
32-inch LCD panel for TV, for example, usually uses 12 
CCFL tubes, and can only be divided into 12 areas if 
implementing local dimming technology. Moreover, the 
biggest problem of the CCFL light is the insufficient 
switching off speed, and strongly driving up its switching 
on and off speed will impair the lifetime of the CCFL.  
On the contrary, direct type LED backlights, especially 
low-power LEDs, due to using more LEDs (for example: 
Samsung 46-inch LCD TV uses 1,500 white LEDs as 
backlight), and the matrix array, every LED can be 
treated as a single unit of local dimming theoretically. 
Hence, currently the best backlight is none other than the 
direct type low-power LED.  
 
1.5 Methods of Lowering the Power 
Consumption of the LCD Monitor 
While LCD TVs keep stepping toward large scale, 
high definition, and multiple functions, the cost, power 
consumption, is raising as well. Currently, LCD camps 
lower the power consumption of LED backlight mainly 
through the following methods: developing high 
efficiency LED backlight modules, increasing the 
aperture ratio of LCD panels, new type optical 
membrane development, and reducing the number of 
circuits used. The advantage of increasing the aperture 
ratio of LCD panels is that due to the increased backlight 
penetration, the brightness of the backlight may be 
lowered, resulting in less power consumption of the LCD 
panel. Other ways to reduce the power consumption 
include adopting new type optical membrane. This kind 
of membrane can increase the brightness of the LCD, or 
recover the previously lost light and reuse it; besides, 
reducing the usage of circuits and components also has 
significant effect on lowering the power consumption.

the transient current could raise light flux to reach the 
same level of luminous intensity with traditional local 
dimming. The benefits of increasing scan lines are that 
LED would have more time in non-consumption of 
power, the time in which no current passed through LED 
will be more, the time in which the temperature of LED 
is reducing is longer and the frequency of LED overheat 
will be reduced.   
Obviously, the advantages brought by using scan 
matrix to do local dimming are the less current drivers, 
simpler circuit connections that the driving cost could be 
effectively reduced, particularly when the local dimming 
is for each LED whereas the disadvantages are that the 
each scan cycle will be shorter and the luminous 
intensity of LED will be darker with more numbers of 
scan.  
Table 1 is the comparisons between the size of LED 
series areas and related connections. Originally, it was 
composed of 15 scan signal lines and 24 groups of 
constant current drivers, so it needed 39 connections. 
However, for enhancing LED luminous intensity, the 
scan signal lines were re-divided into five parts. Thus the 
five-fold current drivers were needed. After improving 
scan circuit, it needed 123 connections to control three 
scan signal lines and 120 groups of constant current 
drivers (Table 2). Comparing with the traditional LED, it 
reduced 237 connections and original 30 IC were 
dramatically reduced to 10 that would in turn reduce 
much cost.

Summing up above-mentioned, under the premise of 
not changing the total number of LED (1440), in order to 
enhance the backlight resolution and the luminous 
intensity of LED, we adopted the form of 4 LED series 
as single local dimming that would raise the LED 
backlight resolution to 360 blocks. If we use traditional 
local dimming to drive, it will need 30 driving ICs 
(AS3694A) to implement the driving work, If we use 
scan to drive, it will need only 10 driving ICs plus three 
scan switches (three scan lines) to implement driving 
work. But in order to enhance the resolution, simplify the 
design of power adapter and reduce signal interference, 
we conducted the modification of scan circuit by 
multiplying the number of switches and increasing 30 
sets of scan switches but comparing with the traditional 
scan circuit, less 210 connection lines and 20 driving ICs 
(still there were three scan line signals but the 10 sets 
have the same time sequence).   
As the Fig. 4 shows, in the framework of LED 
backlight modules of 42-inch local dimming scan matrix, 
LCM represents high-resolution LC panel driving and 
the part of liquid crystal, BLM represents low-resolution 
LED backlight driving circuit and luminous back panel. 
The hardware of designs realized by the research 
includes DC/DC Converter, Scan Switch, Driving circuit 
for LED Driver and Backlight Panel Local Dimming

dimming for any point under the scan mode. The words

4.4 The Static Image Input by Dynamic Data  
The following pictures are the static images displayed 
by the backlight modules (120 Hz) of 42-inch white light 
LED. We could see the that the luminance of LED 
backlight panel will change with input DVI-D digital 
signals and comparing with the liquid crystal signal, we 
could obtain the result that the shape of light generated at 
the resolution (360 blocks) is closer to that displayed by 
the liquid crystal.
