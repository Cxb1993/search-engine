 Abstract 
 
In the present years, with 
nanotechnology rapidly developed, the 
research has been paid much attention to the 
fundamental work especially in the vibrations 
of mechanical structures. From this trend, the 
nonlinear analysis of beams starts running 
from the region of academia to the realm of 
engineering. The investigation of nonlinear 
contact and nonlinear pull-in of micro beams 
is a fairly typical example. Most of solution 
methods of the nonlinear problems are based 
on the simplified models and the 
approximate methods, but they are not 
suitable for the micro systems that requires of 
higher precision. Consequently, this project 
is to analyze the nonlinear behavior of beams 
and to provides a simple, high-accuracy and 
systematic solution method, which is not 
only purposed to analyze the generalized 
nonlinear problem and to excavate 
thoroughly the nonlinear behaviors of beams, 
but also satisfied the demand of 
high-accuracy micro systems. The 
representation of the solution method will 
have a concrete contribution over the science 
and the engineering application.

ABSTRACT 
A wind power turbine blade is modeled as a rotating 
beam with flapping angles and setting angles. Based on 
the Bernoulli Euler beam theory, without considering the 
axial extension deformation and the Coriolis forces effect,     
the coupled governing differential equations and the 
associated boundary conditions are derived by using  
Hamilton's principle. It is shown that if the geometric and 
material properties of the beam are in polynomial forms, 
then the exact solution for the problem can be obtained. 
Finally, the influences of the flapping angle and other 
physic parameters on the natural frequencies are 
investigated. 
 
KEY WORDS 
rotating beams, flapping angle, vibrations 
 
1 Introduction 
Due to the increasing demand on the clean energy, 
wind power turbines, in especial the horizontal-axis wind 
turbines (HAWTs) [1], are widely installed around the 
world. In the dynamic analysis of the wind turbine blade, 
it can be modeled as a rotating non-uniform beam with 
flapping angles and setting angles.    
Rotating beams are importance in many practical 
applications such as turbine blades, helicopter rotor blades, 
airplane propellers, and robot manipulators. The problems 
have been studied for a long time. An interesting review 
of the subject can be found in the papers by Leissa [2], 
Ramamurti and Balasubramanian [3], Rosen [4] and Lin 
[5].  
Based on the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory, the 
governing characteristic differential equation for bending 
vibrations of rotating non-uniform beams is a fourth-order 
ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients 
expressed in terms of the flexural displacement (Lo et al. 
[6]). Carlson and Wang [7] obtained an exact solution for 
the static bending of a rotating uniform Bernoulli-Euler 
beam. Rao and Carnegie [8] and Hodges [9] studied the 
steady response of a rotating cantilever nonuniform 
Bernoulli-Euler beam by using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. 
Ko [10] studied the flexural behavior of rotating sandwich 
tapered beams with linearly distributed loads by using the 
finite difference technique. Hernried [11] determined the 
in-plane (lag) and out-of-plane (flap) dynamic deflections 
of a flexible twisted nonuniform rotating blade through a 
mode superposition approach. 
The influence of tip mass, rotating speed , hub radius, 
setting angle, taper ratio, and elastic root restraints on the 
natural frequencies of transverse vibrations of a rotating 
beam were investigated by many investigators (Pnueli 
[12]; Hodges and Rutkowshi [13]; Wright et al. [14]; Liu 
and Yeh [15]; Storti and Aboelnaga [16]; Lee and Kuo 
[17], [18]). 
From the existing literature, it can be found that no 
analytical solution for the vibration of a rotating beam 
with a flapping angle had been presented. In addition, 
little attention has been focused on the investigation of the 
mechanism of rotating instability. In this paper, the 
analytical method given by Lin [5] will be used to solve 
the vibration problem of a rotating non-uniform 
Bernoulli-Euler beam with flapping and setting angles. 
Moreover, the influence of the coupling effect of the 
flapping angle and the setting angle, the rotating speed, 
the taper ratio ,and hub radius on the natural frequencies 
will be investigated. 
 
2 Governing equations and boundary conditions 
 Consider the flexural and the axial motions of a 
rotating Bernoulli-Euler beam. The beam is elastically 
mounted with setting angleθ and flapping angle φ  on a 
hub and rotates with constant angular velocity, as shown 
in Figure 1.  
The displacement fields of the beam in the x, y, and z-
directions are 
 
 It should be noted that ‘ 2 2cos φΩ ’ is the coefficient of 
axial centrifugal force. If the flapping angle is zero, the 
coefficient becomes the same as that of a conventional 
rotating beam (Lee and Lin [20]). If the flapping angle is 
increased, the axial centrifugal force decreases. It is 
concluded that the increasing of the flapping angle usually 
decreases the natural frequencies. In terms of the 
dimensionless quantities listed in the nomenclature, the 
dimensionless governing differential equations and the 
boundary conditions are obtained as follows:

If the flapping angle φ  is zero, Eqs. (14) is exactly 
the same as those given by Lee and Lin [20]. 
3.2  Frequency equation 
One can derive the frequency equations of the system 
in terms of W by using the following method. For the 
system in terms of W, there exist four fundamental 
solutions of the governing characteristic equations (22). 
The four linearly independent fundamental solutions 
( )jV ξ , j = 1, 2, 3, 4, can be chosen such that they satisfy 
the following normalization conditions at the origin of the 
coordinate system:  
1 2 3 4

,   (19) 
where primes indicate differentiation with respect to 
dimensionless spatial variable ξ. If the coefficients of the 
differential equation are in polynomial forms, then the 
closed-form power series solutions can be obtained by 
following the algorithm developed by Lee and Lin [21]. 
       Substituting the homogeneous solution which is a 
linear combination of the four fundamental solutions into 
the four boundary conditions in terms of W, the frequency 
equation for the decoupled system is obtained, 
0π =    (20) 
The frequency equations in terms of W for the 
rotating Bernoulli-Euler beam with a general elastically 
restrained is derived and tabulated in Appendix I. One can 
determine the natural frequencies via the frequency 
equation. 
 
4 Numerical Results 
To illustrate the previous analysis and investigate the 
influence of the parameters on the natural frequencies of a 
rotating nonuniform Bernoulli-Euler beam, several 
numerical results are presented and discussed. In the 
following numerical analysis, the material properties and 
the width of the beam are assumed to be constants and the 
depth of the beam varied linearly with the taper ratio λ . 
Consequently, ( ) ( )31 , 1m bλξ λξ= + = + . 
Table 1 shows the first four natural frequencies of a 
nonuniform cantilever beam. It is observed that the 
natural frequencies are determined by employing via the 
frequency equation in the dimensionless flexural 
displacement W, given in Appendix. While comparing the 
natural frequencies of the Bernoulli-Euler beams with 
those given by Hodges and Rutkowski [13], by Lee and 
Kuo [18], and by Lee and Lin [20], it shows that the 
results are very consistent. 
Figure 2 shows the influence of the flapping angle, 
the setting angle and the rotating speed on the first natural 
frequency of the cantilever beam. It can be found that: 
 (1) When the flapping angle or the setting angle is 
increased, the axial centrifugal force decreases. 
Consequently, the associated natural frequencies 
decrease.  
(2) The influence of the flapping angle on the natural 
frequencies of a beam with high rotating speed is 
greater than that of the beam with low rotating speed. 
(3) With the same setting angle, when the flapping angle 
is less than a critical number, the natural frequencies 
of a beam with high rotating speed are greater than 
those with low rotating speed. However, when the 
flapping angle is greater than the critical number, the 
natural frequencies of a beam with high rotating 
speed will be less than those with low rotating speed.  
(4)  When the flapping angle φ = 900, there is no axial 
centrifugal force. In this case, the setting angle θ  
will have no influence on the natural frequencies of 
the beam. This conclusion as indicated in this Figure 
is consistent with our common physic sense.  
(5)  When the dimensionless rotating speed is 5 and the 
flapping angle is increased to be greater than 550, the 
natural frequency becomes imaginary. It implies that 
the divergent instability phenomenon may occur 
In this paper, a wind power turbine blade is modeled 
as a rotating beam with flapping angles and setting angles. 
Based on the Bernoulli Euler beam theory, without 
considering the axial extension deformation and the 
Coriolis forces effect, the governing differential equations 
for the pure bending vibrations of a rotating non-uniform 
Bernoulli-Euler beam with flapping and setting angles is 
derived and reduced into one complete fourth-order 
ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients 
in the dimensionless flexural displacement, respectively.  
It is shown that 
(1) When the flapping angle or the setting angle is 
increased, the associated natural frequencies decrease.  
(2) The influence of the flapping angle on the natural 
frequencies of a beam with high rotating speed is 
greater than that of the beam with low rotating speed. 
(3) With the same setting angle, when the flapping angle 
is less than a critical number, the natural frequencies 
of a beam with high rotating speed are greater than 
those with low rotating speed. However, when the 
flapping angle is greater than the critical number, the 
natural frequencies of a beam with high rotating 
speed will be less than those with low rotating speed.  
(4)  The divergent instability phenomenon may occur 
when the rotating speed and the flapping angle are 
greater than the critical values. 
(5)   At the same rotating speed, the critical flapping angle 
that associate to the happening of phenomenon of 
divergence instability will decrease, as the 
translational spring constant 11γ is decreased.
