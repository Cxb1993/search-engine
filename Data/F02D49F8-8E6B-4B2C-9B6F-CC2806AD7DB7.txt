英文摘要
Keywords: Trigger digits, Finger and thumb function, kinematics, functional outcomes
assessment, SAPR, Hand VR system
The purpose of this project in the first year was to investigate the kinematical performance
of a common hand disorder, the trigger digit, by using the objective motion analysis technique.
This study provides quantitative evidence of kinematics and functional outcomes of different
graded trigger fingers based on Froimson’s classification. Forty-seven patients with fifty-five
trigger fingers and graded twenty-three, eleven, and twenty-one fingers as grade II, III, and IV,
respectively were recruited in the experiment. The QuickDASH questionnaire evaluated the
subject’s self-perception of hand symptoms and functions. The study measured maximal
workspace of the fingertip motion and range of motion (ROM) of the finger joints during an
assigned tendon gliding task using an electromagnetic tracking device. The results quantitatively
showed that trigger fingers in different impairment levels have different kinematics and
functional performances. The study could provide an objective method for assisting clinical
diagnosis and investigation, and the use of the biomechanical and ergonomic approaches to
analyze the mechanism of injury is practical and valuable.
The research aim of the second year is to investigate the treatment outcome after the ”
Sonographically Assisted Percutaneous Release (SAPR)”method to the trigger digits by using
the kinematical model and three-dimensional imaging model of the hand which was developed in
our integrated research project in the first year. The SAPR surgical method was advocated by
Professor Jou I-Ming in the Department of Orthopedics of National Cheng Kung University to
deal with the triggering and pain problems of the digits. Twenty-two patients with idiopathic
trigger digits who received the surgery were recruited. A motion tracking system was used to
measure the assigned kinematical parameters at the pre-surgical visit, and at one week, four
weeks and twelve weeks after surgery. The hand strength and functional outcome were also
obtained using dynamometer and self-report questionnaire assessments. The results showed that
the painful movement or insufficient tendon excursion of the trigger digit might elicit the
movement and strength loss, as well as the interference in functional performance. After the
disappearance of the pain and triggering by the SAPR, the kinematical and functional
improvements could be tested via objectively quantitative assessments which are described in this
study. The objective and precise methods was developed to assess the surgical outcome of this

2Grade I -- Pre-triggering-pain; tenderness over the A1 pulley; history of catching by not
demonstrable on physical examination.
Grade II -- Triggering, active; demonstrable catching, patient can actively extend
Grade III -- Triggering, passive; demonstrable catching requiring passive extension or
inability to actively flex.
Grade IV -- Contracture; demonstrable catching, with a fixed flexion PIP joint contracture.
Although the grading methods have been widely used, applying these methods is not
without limitations. Mechanical symptoms in certain trigger digit patients are not as typical as
the taxonomic criteria, so physicians might have difficulty judging the grade of severity.
Furthermore, patients diagnosed within the same grade can exhibit a large variation of
movement patterns or symptoms among each other. Some clinicians might also receive
complaints (e.g. pain, rough movements or weakness) from post-operative patients; however,
clinical grade findings show no mechanical problem or abnormal movement. Researchers also
use clinical observations of abnormal movement, and rate pain according to the classified
standard and patient satisfaction questionnaires to measure outcomes before and after treating
trigger digit. Quantitative evidence that investigates using classification methods is critically
lacking, giving rise to problems of diagnostic difficulty and symptomatic interpretation.
Clinical Approaches for Trigger Digits
Non-invasive Treatment
Resting is a simple strategy for the mild cases of the trigger digits. Occupational therapists
often build a splint for clients to hold and rest the inflamed area or digit. Sometimes, special
exercises to promote tendon gliding are encouraged. Since a large proportion of the trigger digits
result from repetitive trauma during task performance, the ways to protect and change activities
to prevent triggering and to give the inflamed area a chance to heal are important. This type of
treatment should be instituted as soon after the occurrence of the symptoms as possible. Besides
protective resting, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also can be combined with
massage, ultrasound or ice therapy to reduce the symptoms of patients.
Invasive Treatment (non-operative approach)
A cortisone injection into the tendon sheath is a rapid way to decrease the inflammation and
shrink the nodule. The injection helps relieve the triggering problems, but the effects may be
short-term. Consequently, a resting splint may be used after the injection to help decrease the
4motion analysis techniques. Thus, to assess the outcomes of the patients with trigger digits after
the SAPR intervention based on objective and accurate methods is feasible and meaningful for
the clinical uses.
Applications of Motion Analysis Techniques in Hand Evaluations
Computer-aided motion analysis technique has widely been used as objective spatial and
temporal tools to assess movements of body segments. In the past decade, motion analysis
systems were begun applying on the investigation of movements of upper extremity. The
Hand Group in National Cheng Kung University and Hospital have developed and
accomplished several projects to use the motion analysis system in assessing the finger and
thumb motion. We have used the motion analysis system to develop a normal database of the
maximal fingertip motion area in young adult based on Chiu’s method(Chiu, 1995; Chiu and
Su, 1996; Chiu et al., 1998a). The fingertip motion area has a linear correlation with the square
of finger length, therefore, the normal value of the fingertip motion area of an injured finger
can be calculated from the finger length. This method has been further modified to record
simultaneously the dynamic angular changes in each finger joint during the fingertip motion
area study (Chiu et al., 2000; Chiu et al., 1998b) (Su et al., 2002). With these evaluations, the
fingertip motion area and the active range of motion of each finger joint can be measured and
compared in serial examinations. The functional loss of each injured finger can be calculated
either from the fingertip motion area or from the active range of motion of each finger joint.
This technique has been shown to provide reliable and objective measurements for
assessing motor function of the fingers. Our team extended the success of the previous work to
automatic video evaluation of thumb function (Kuo et al., 2002; Su et al., 2003). The thumb
kinematical model for measuring the motor function of the thumb combines all planar
movements of the thumb in a 3D space, providing a quantitative value indicative of the total
functional workspace of the thumb-tip motion and goniometry.
The kinematical model of finger and thumb incorporating with the motion analysis
system provides a repeatable single quantitative value which combines all movements of the
finger and thumb in 3D space, replacing the complicated representations of angular and linear
measurements of different joints and different movement planes. This technique has been used
to evaluate mechanical abnormalities and deformities of the finger and thumb, as well as
motor function and neural function, with static and kinetic graphic displays available to aid in
diagnosis and treatment.
6environment with precise control over a large number of variables which might exist in a real
world to construct a proper situation for physiological and kinematical performances. In addition
to creating a therapeutic VR setting, virtual environments also provide the means to better assess
and evaluate the patient's functional performance. Sensors can be attached to the patient's body to
measure the motions, and the sensor readings can be transparently stored and evaluated by the
system.
Motivations
Hand research from a biomechanical perspective has grown the past two decades. The
motion analysis technique has increasingly been the objective method in studies of hand
kinematics and functional performance. Research verifies computer-aided motion analysis
methods as a feasible quantitative method to evaluate hand movements and functional
performances. Researchers have used various modern video capture and electromagnetic tracking
systems to investigate joint kinematics of the in vitro and in vivo hand studies. The advantage of
using the motion analysis technique is to provide objective spatial and temporal assessment rather
than subjective conventional observation by physicians. This study characterizes quantitative
motion of each patient according to the corresponding grade of trigger digit classification via
objective movement analysis and patient-based perception of functional outcome. This work
assumes that significant differences in kinematics and functional outcomes can be explored
among different graded trigger fingers, possibly leading to a better understanding of precise
kinematics and functions of trigger digit patients. This study demonstrates practicality of the
proposed methodology and factors which assist clinicians in diagnosing and comprehending the
mechanism of this disease.
In prior studies, researchers usually used simple physical examinations, such as clinical
observations of range of motion (ROM) or movement abnormality, pain rating and self-reported
satisfaction questionnaires, to evaluate the outcomes before and after the treatment of trigger
digits. With these methods, clinicians can easily and conveniently collect the outcomes of
treatment; however, little research has focused on objectively assessing the efficacy of surgical
release based on scientifically quantitative measures. In order to thoroughly describe hand
movements, uses of three-dimensional and dynamic goniometric measures to represent the ROM
of the thumb and fingers based on computer-aided motion analysis techniques have been reported
recently. The strength of using the method is to provide objectively spatial and temporal
assessment rather than the static indication using conventional goniometric measurements. To
8step to process. Afterwards, the motion data of the trigger digits which were collected in the
previous two years were recruited in the system. The short term goal of this system was only
applied for the evaluation of the trigger digits. The long term purpose of this system will be
anticipated to widely use in assessing more types of the hand conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Apparatuses
The First Year
The disability/symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5) of Hand functional outcome assessment
tool (QuickDASH), which is a simple questionnaire, was used to evaluate the subject
self-assessment of hand problem. The QuickDASH is a simple, reliable and valid questionnaire
for evaluating subject self-assessment of hand problems. This questionnaire was developed by
shortening the full, thirty-item DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Outcome
Measure used in previous studies for evaluating upper extremity function improvement (Lifchez
et al., 2005; Amadio, 1997; Amadio, 2001; Hudak et al., 1996). The main part of QuickDASH is
a disability/symptom section (eleven items, scored 1-5) of hand function assessment tools. After
completing the questionnaire, this study used the scores for all items to calculate a QuickDASH
score ranging from 0 to 100, indicating the severity from “no disability” to “most severe 
disability”, respectively.
The kinematical data were measured using a
miniBirdTM electromagnetic tracking system (Ascension
Technology Corporation, Burlington, VT, USA.)
incorporated with the MotionMonitorTM Version 6
(Innovative Sports Training, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA)
(Figure 1) and then stored to the computer. This system
has advantages of portability, brief capturing time and
real time measurement for finger function using
magnetic field technology to measure the position and
orientation of sensors in relation to a magnetic source.
The small sensor size, 8 mm wide, is appropriate to apply on finger phalanxes. In an ideal
environment without metal interference, this magnetic tracking system achieves position
accuracy up to 1.8 mm and 0.5 degrees at a 76.2 cm range. This research recorded finger

A reference hand model which was conducted by Professor Sun in the Department of
Computer Science and Information Engineering of National Cheng Kung University was also
used to simulate the motion data collecting from the motion analysis system. This reference hand
model semi-automatically constructed from utilizing MR images to obtain hand bone structures
and proposing a model-based method to segment hand bones from five sequentially discrete
postures of a grasping motion. The model is drivable and with an articulated structure. Then, the
reference model can be driven to the desired position on the other postural images for automatic
registration. The optimal solution of registration is based on the constraints on intensity, texture
and hand geometry.
Subjects
The First Year
Forty-seven patients, twelve males (average age: 59.64±15.24years) and thirty-five females
(average age: 60.76±11.06 years), with fifty-five trigger fingers participated in this study. All
subjects were outpatients recruited from the Department of Orthopedics at National Cheng Kung
University Hospital during the period from September, 2006 to September, 2007. Two males and
six females exhibited multiple trigger fingers. Figure 3 shows age and gender distribution of these
patients. Idiopathic trigger fingers formed the entry criterion for including patients in this study.
We assume the multiple fingers within the same patient are independent for analysis purposes.
This study excluded patients with rheumatoid arthritis and previous traumatic injuries of the hand.
All patients displayed typical painful triggering symptoms for at least three months. This research
informed subjects of the experimental purposes and procedures prior to participation and asked
them to sign a consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board at National Cheng Kung
University Hospital. Trigger digit symptoms were graded by an experienced hand surgeon using
Froimson’s classification.

Figure 4-- The sensor set for trigger finger
injuries to fingers and thumb were asked to participate in this experiment. The motion data of
the twenty patients with trigger finger in the previous two year studies was used to assist in the
development of the animation model and to validate the feasibility of the model.
Experimental Procedures
The First Year
The participants were asked to position the
elbow joint in 90 degree and wrist joint in neutral
position using a jig. The motion data of the trigger
digits of both hands were recorded by the four
sensors attached on the dorsal aspect of the digital
phalanx bone, middle phalanx bone, proximal
phalanx bone and the metacarpal bone (Figure 4).
As for the trigger thumb, the four sensors were
attached on the dorsal aspect of the digital phalanx
bone, proximal phalanx bone, metacarpal bone and
styloid process of radius. The subject was asked to
perform three times tendon gliding and
fist-extension exercises which are often used for
hand treatment and rehabilitation and allow the
flexor tendons to glide to their maximum movement range. The program includes six discrete
positions: straight, metacarpal joints flexion, straight fist, fist, hook, and then straight (Figure 5).
Since the experimental task was not a common movement for subjects, the study required
subjects to practice the exercise before formal data collection. After demonstrating the task to
the subject, the subject practiced the movement until he or she performed as smoothly as
possible, and then the researcher started collecting the data. If pain during the movement
became unendurable, the experiment stopped.
The Second Year
Each participant was requested to visit and return to our hospital in accordance with the
following timetable: pre-surgical visit, and at one week, four weeks and twelve weeks after
surgery. The participants received thorough evaluations which consisted of clinical examinations
(wound healing, pain rating by a numerical pain rating scale, triggering, neurological conditions

fingers, respectively. The movement of each bone segment could be specified based on the 3D
positions of markers.
Since the finger joints are highly articulated and their motions are constrained by certain
degrees of freedom (DOF), the motion of each finger bone segment was supposed to be
characterized by rotational motion. With the proposed reference hand model, the rotational
motion in a finger joint could be conveniently controlled by utilizing the corresponding motion
parameters (MP), which include a rotation center and rotation axis. Therefore, given rotation
angle of joint motion, the reference model could be driven to any specific posture. The rotation
angle of each finger joint was given by the included angle between the adjacent bone segments:
With the rotation angle and rotation axis, a transformation matrix was computed for
determining the movement of bone segment using the Rodrigues' rotation formula (Hill and
Kelley, 2007). The motion of each finger bone segment with respect to its proximally adjacent
bone (PAB) could thus be simulated. Motion animation of trigger-finger patient was
demonstrated in our experiment, and moreover, the behavior difference of finger motion between
the trigger-finger patients and normal subjects could be easily observed.
Each subject was asked to adopt six discrete positions in a continuous series. The program
includes straight, metacarpal joints flexion, straight fist, fist, hook, and then straight (Figure 5).
Through this motion sequences, the maximal range of motion of each joint in different motion
planes of normal subjects and trigger digits patients were built up as the maximal range of motion
database. Otherwise, the selected functional prehensile and grip tasks were asked to perform by
the subject to establish the functional database. In conjunction with the kinetic model in the other
project of our integrated research project, a biomechanical model, including kinematics and
kinetics database, of the fingers were developed for further evaluation and investigation.

images by matching the texture template of bone model and the texture of corresponding image
region. In the second one, a refinement for those bones which were not influenced by image
artifacts was performed by optimizing the intensity homogeneity of bone. Therefore, we used the
texture matching, which considered the intensities distributed within the bone and its vicinity, to
overcome the problem of large intensity variation. This two-stage strategy was thus more reliable
in registration of MR hand images.
The penalty energy prevented the solution deviating from the real ones by using constraints on
bone geometry. Due to the use of penalty energy, those infeasible solutions, which made a bone
model intersect with its PAB or correspond to a wrong finger, were avoided such that the registration
results are more stable.
Data Analysis
The First and Second Year
During the thumb and finger movements, the maximal finger workspace and angular
acceleration of thumb and finger joints, the range of motion (ROM) of each finger joint, and
angular acceleration (Rα) of each digit joints were calculated. The description of each parameter
was showed as follows:
(1) Maximal workspace of the thumb or finger motions. The maximal workspace determines the
motion ranges created by the extreme movements of the thumb or finger joints. That is, there are
no additional movements of the thumb or finger that can exceed this described workspace, so we
used the term“maximalworkspace”to indicate the maximal motion range capacity of the thumb
and fingers. In order to obtain the maximal workspace of the thumb, two assigned movements
which consisted of a maximal circumduction of the thumb with the interphangeal (IP) joint in an
extended position (the trajectory “a” in Figure 6A ) and with the thumb kept in a position of
maximum flexion and rotated maximally (the curve “b” in Figure 6A), were required. The
maximal workspace of the thumb-tip motion was defined as the surface area of the side of this
irregular cone space enveloped by these two thumb-tip paths (Su et al., 2003).
(2) Dynamic goniometry of the thumb or finger joints. Conventional goniometric measure is a
static representation of a joint ROM without considering any of the time-related factors. The
maximal joint ROM of each digit, which is commonly represented by the total active motion
(TAM), could be achieved through the above-mentioned dynamic movement of each joint of the
thumb or fingers. The maximal workspace and dynamic goniometry provided quantitative
18
software. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare the mean of variables
among three impairment grades, followed by post hoc analysis with least significant difference
(LSD) for individual comparisons. These variables included means of QuickDASH scores,
workspace, range of motion (ROM) and Rα in the interphalangeal (IP) joint,
metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint, and carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of trigger thumbs, in the
distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and metacarpophalangeal
(MP) joint of trigger fingers. The mean difference was significant at the 0.05 level.
The Second Year
Statistical analyses for the experimental parameters, including maximal workspace,
goniometry, Ra, hand strength and QuickDASH score, were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The paired t-test was used to compare the measured variables in
the pre-surgical condition between the involved and the corresponding finger in the contralateral
intact hand. In order to evaluate the performance of the involved digit of each subject under four
different follow-up conditions (pre-surgery, 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-surgery), the
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was executed. The post hoc test for multiple
comparisons was performed based on the Bonferroni method to indicate the difference between
different follow-up examinations. The significance level was set at 0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The First Year
Results graded twenty-three digits as grade II, eleven digits as grade III, and the others as
grade IV with a total of fourteen index, twenty-five long, thirteen ring and three little fingers.
Table 1 showed the outcome measures of dependent variables. The mean score of QuickDASH
for each grade showed that functional outcomes among impairment grades had significant
differences (p < 0.05). Post hoc analysis indicated a smaller QuickDASH score for the grade II
group than for scores in the grade III and grade IV groups (p < 0.05). The mean workspace also
showed significant performance differences for the grade II group compared with the other two
groups (p < 0.05). Figure 4 showed representative fingertip motion trajectories which delegate
workspace for three patients in each different grade II, III and IV. The result represented
diagnosis of the more severe symptomatic grade, showing smaller workspace. The ROM of the
PIP joint was also significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.05). Follow-up post hoc
testing revealed that the ROM of PIP joint in grade II group is significantly greater than that in

Several previous studies reported that the high incidence of trigger digit falls into the
middle and young elderly age group, especially in the female gender (Bonnici et al., 2004;
Nimigan et al., 2006; Fahey, et al., 1954). Our study in the first year revealed similar results that
76.35% of recruited subjects were in their fourth to sixth decades. Several of them (15%) suffer
multiple trigger digits, influencing hand movement in functional manipulation. This study
provided objective kinematic information relating to trigger digit severity. The mean
QuickDASH scores showed significant difference among patients in three grades. Post hoc
comparisons revealed that the mean QuickDASH of grade II groups was significantly smaller
than that of grade III and IV. However, findings showed no significant difference in scores
between patients in grade III and IV. One possible explanation for this result could be that grade
22
trials still show the locking effect. The grade III patients (grade III) showed highly obvious
snapping during finger extension. It was because they executed vigorous extension force to
overcome the opposite catching resistance of the flexor tendon. Thus, an extremely high joint
angular acceleration during finger extension occurred when the A1 pulley released the tightly
caught tendon. The findings of Rα of each joint in Table 1 provide quantitative information
depicting the specific triggering property of the trigger digit.
This study contains several limitations. First, it did not recruit trigger fingers in grade I.
Since grade I patients sustain minor symptoms which do not affect daily hand functioning, they
seldom visit the clinic. Most trigger finger patients are above grade II. Second, the heterogeneity
of subjects with factors such as gender, age, occupation, hand size, and extend period limit the
generalization of findings. However, using the quantitative technique in motion analysis could
play a complementary role in clinical assessments, provide kinematic descriptions of trigger
fingers, and assist in understanding performances following the experimental task. Future studies
could use kinetic parameters, such as resistance forces of the trigger fingertip, to qualify trigger
finger performance. Biomechanical evaluations contribute to a more complete understanding of
trigger fingers.
The Second Year
The clinical examinations showed no evidence of residual triggering or locking, and all had
an improved ROM. The puncture wound for the percutaneous release became almost invisible
within an average five days after surgery. In comparison with the pre-surgical pain (2 to 3 points
on the numerical pain scale) around the released A1 area, sixteen patients (72%) complained of a
3 to 4 rating of pain, and the rest reported a 0 to 1 rating on the pain scale in the first postsurgical
visit. Twenty-two patients expressed a 0 to 1 pain rating in the fourth-week visit, postoperatively.
The results showed obviously different kinematical performances between the intact and
injured hand of the patient (Figure 9). Table 2 showed the differences in the experimental
parameters between the intact and involved digits before surgery, and the consequential outcomes
in the follow-up examinations. The hand strength results indicated that the involved hand
produced significantly less grip, pinch and three-jaw pinch strengths (p<0.001) than those
generated by the intact hand. Although the statistical findings revealed that the hand strength in
the first postoperative follow-up did not show significant improvement, and was even worse than
the pre-surgical condition, the outcomes showed significant improvement in the following
examinations.

In terms of the kinematical parameters, the maximal workspace of the affected digit in both
the thumb and finger was significantly smaller than that of the intact one (p<0.001) before
surgery. Although there was no significant improvement of the workspace at the first postsurgical
follow-up examination in comparison with the pre-surgical condition, significant increases were
found in the consequential assessments, using the post hoc test (Figure 10). The TAM in the
dynamic motion, showed a significant difference between the intact and involved finger before
the surgery (Table 2). The repeated measures indicated that the TAMs of the involved hand had
improved significantly (p<0.01) between each of the follow-up examinations, except the test
between the pre-surgical and the first follow-up evaluations. In surveying the data of each joint
ROM in the pre-surgical condition, the PIP and DIP joints were found to have statistical
significance between the intact and involved hand (PIP: 95.05o vs. 74.47o, p<0.001; DIP: 83.79o
vs. 60.21o, p=0.001). No significant difference in the range of motion between the intact and
involved hand (59.43o vs. 54.54o, p=0.06) was found in the MP joint.

Other than our prior limited experiment, this study was the first in the English literature that
we know, to investigate the kinematical changes and correlate them with the functional changes
of trigger digits that had undergone surgical release. Most hand clinicians described the
characteristics of the trigger digit based on clinical observations and experiences. The triggering
or catching property during the movement of the involved digit is easily determined. However,
the clinicians may not describe this phenomenon quantitatively, so the literature generally
presents the effectiveness of intervention using simple and convenient physical examinations by
physicians, as well as patients' self-reported satisfaction questionnaires (Eastwood et al., 1992;
Benson et al., 1997; Benson and Ptaszek., 1997; Fu et al., 2006; Ha et al., 2001; Jou and Chern.,
2006; Kazuki et al., 2006; Lim et al., 2007; Maneerit et al., 2003; Patel and Moradia., 1997; Pope
and Wolfe., 1995)
Kinematical investigations which have been widely used to assist in orthopedic diagnoses and
treatment may provide a new concept for quantifying the inappropriate movements of the trigger
digit. For example, clinical experience judging the severity of the trigger digit is usually based on
a four- or five-grade taxonomy (Eastwood et al., 1992; Froimson., 1993; Newport et al., 1992;
Quinnell., 1980). This study found that the kinematical characteristics of patients are varied, as
shown in figure three, perhaps due to variations in the severity grade.
This research work used the workspace, joint ROM and TAM as kinematical factors to
investigate the relevance of the capability of joint movement between the intact and involved
finger, as well as the pre- and post-operative conditions. Although most clinical experiences
indicated that only the severest grade of the trigger digit has joint mobility problems such as a
fixed or contracted joint (Froimson., 1993; Quinnell., 1980), the findings in this study showed
that the maximal workspace as well as the joint ROM of the digits might be influenced due to
symptomatic locking or pain among most of the participants in different grades. The PIP and DIP
joints of the affected digit showed a significant decrease of the ROM, which reflects the
possibility that the excursions of the flexor tendon might be restrained owing to the change of
anatomical structures or the resultant pain. Neither the workspace nor TAM in the first
post-surgical examination revealed significant improvement because of the post-operative pain,
tenderness or swelling around the wound. Similar results have been reported in previous studies
using clinical observations or telephone interviews (Fu et al., 2006; Jou and Chern., 2006; Lim et
al., 2007; Nimigan et al., 2006; Park et al., 2004; Patel and Moradia., 1997; Turowski et al.,
1997). Subsequent to the period of soft tissue recovery from the acute inflammation due to
30
occupational and daily living activities. After the disappearance of the pain and triggering
phenomenon, hand strength and functional performance, from the patients’perspective, gradually
improve, even if the outcomes do not improve immediately after the surgical release.
Although this study does not focus on emphasizing the advantage of using the
sonographically-assisted percutaneous release to deal with the trigger digit, both objective
kinematical measures and the clients’self-perception show that the effectiveness of this technique
is satisfactory. Though this study seems to focus on developing a kinematical model to assess the
movement features of the trigger digit in a presently experimental stage, some benefits and future
applications could be addressed from this study. And a complete kinematical and functional
assessment, including data analysis and report, might be accomplished within fifteen minutes and
implemented in a consulting room, and may provide clinicians convenient evaluation to the
patients’ condition on each visit.
The Third Year
The proposed approach was applied to the MRI volumes of different postures in the
experiments. Here, the results showed only the posture 3. In Figure 12, the boundaries (the
colored contours) of the segmented bones were overlaid onto the MR images. It clearly reveals
that they are very close to the real bone boundaries, even for the tough regions which were with
non-uniform intensity distribution, fuzzy bone boundary or nearby the tendons that have similar
intensity as bones. Above all, this method was highly automatic, manual intervention was few in
segmenting hand bones for all intermediate postures.
As the proposed method especially took the hand geometry into the penalty constraint, the
result of optimization was thus enhanced. Figure 13 shows the effects of the penalty constraint for
better stability of segmentation. In Figure 13b, the target bone, indicated by an arrow, intersects
with its PAB since the solution is trapped in a local minimum. In Figure 13c, the proposed
method achieved a more desirable result. All demonstrations of the current available data show
high agreement between manual and automatic segmentation results.
The motion of each finger bone segment with respect to its proximally adjacent bone can
thus be simulated. Motion animation of trigger-finger patient is demonstrated in our experiment
(Fig. 12), and moreover, the behavior difference of finger motion between the trigger-finger
patients and normal subjects can be easily observed. In addition, the quantitative kinematics
information of each joint during whole motion period was shown in the system (Fig. 13).

CONCLUSIONS
Using the concept of biomechanical perspective to assess the finger joint motion could
measure the finger function more scientifically and describe it in a quantitative way. There are
few literatures which investigate trigger fingers from biomechanical point of view. This study
provided a biomechanical insight into trigger fingers. The subjects’affected thumbs or fingers in
different impairment grade have different performances. The biomechanical method is a good
way to investigate trigger fingers.
The study in the first year assessed kinematics and functional performances in trigger
fingers among impairment grade II, III and IV. The database also builded a more specific and
standard classification for trigger digits. Although workspace and ROM of PIP joint revealed the
same results as QuickDASH scores that grade II patients experience less impairment than
patients in grade III and IV,Rα ofDIP and PIP joint do showed differences between patients in
grade III and IV. This study suggested that using the biomechanical method to investigate
trigger digits is an innovative idea and the results could also serve as evidence-based knowledge
for clinics. The workspace, ROM andRαcould be used for indices to evaluate impairment grade
of trigger digits, and assess new treatment outcome on trigger fingers.
In the second year, through this quantitative assessment instead of conventionally clinical
observation, the experimental factors of this study might be seen as useful indicators which
provide more detail and precise information to assist in clinical diagnoses of the severity of the
trigger digit. In addition, the motion analysis of trigger digits allows clinicians to determine
movement deficiencies using temporal and spatial kinematics data, whether in real-time or
off-line movement examinations. The precise kinematics model might be thought to be an
objective as well as sensitive method to the further investigation of the outcomes between
different interventions, such as conventional vs. surgical approach or sonographically-assisted
percutaneous release vs. open release.
In the third year, a new model-based approach for hand bones segmentation from MRI volume
images of different postures has been presented. At first, an articulated reference model was
constructed from the MR image of first posture. Then, the reference model was automatically
driven to the position each bone. The two-stage registration was then performed based on the
information of intensity, texture and hand geometry. The registration-based segmentation results
were delineated. The proposed automatic method was not only more convenient than the existing
