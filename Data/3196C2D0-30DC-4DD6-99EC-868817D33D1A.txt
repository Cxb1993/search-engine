1. Introduction 
Known human carcinogens, disinfection by-products (DBPs) must be removed from 
drinking water to protect public health. According to Disinfectants/DBP (D/DBP) rule by 
the USEPA (1998), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) should be removed from water by 
means to reduce DBP precursors using enhanced coagulation treatment processes. However, 
the removal of DOC by coagulation alone may not be adequate to meet the D/DBP rule at 
certain water treatment plants. Distribution of DOC in NOM can provide the guideline 
information on the tendency of DBP formation.  
Ozone has the capacity to oxidize DBPs precursors and subsequently helps to reduce 
trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids formation in water (Reckhow et al., 1984). 
Pre-ozonation and coagulation has already been proven to effective for the elimination of 
color, odor and taste-forming chemicals and natural organic matter (NOM) existing in 
water. 
Recently, several studies have reported the effect of ozonation on coagulation process. 
Bourbigot (1984) reported that a low ozone dose of 0.5 to 1 g/m3 was sufficient to enhance 
the coagulation-flocculation process. According to Singer (1990), ozone dosage between 
0.4 and 0.8 mg O3/mg DOC could be viable for the removal of turbidity and the coagulation 
of NOM. Bekbolet et al. (2005) suggested that pre-ozonation is very efficient for 
coagulation and removal of contaminant by achieving 50% of UV254. Orren et al. (2000) 
hypothesized that pre-ozonation reduced the surface charge of particulates which led to 
better coagulation by charge neutralization. Presence of acidic functional groups in NOM 
upon pre-ozonation led to increase the adsorption between NOM and coagulant during 
coagulation (Harrington et al., 1989; Edwards and Benjamin, 1992).  
On the contrary, several researchers have tried to find out the pre-ozonation detrimental 
for coagulation process performance. For instance, Becker and O’Melia (1996) have noted a 
significant reduction in molecular weight distribution of DOC upon ozonation thereby 
increasing the optimal coagulant dose for turbidity and DOC removal. NOM with 
intermediate molecular weight hydrophobic fraction having neutral properties are 
effectively removed by coagulation process with a lower ozone dosage. At higher ozone 
dosages, NOM becomes more hydrophilic and its molecular weight becomes smaller and 
hence, removal efficiency suppressed (Yan et al., 2007). 
Tai-hu lake, one of the major water sources of Kin-men Island, Taiwan, has high organic 
precursors which in turn produces a large amount of chlorinated by-products (e.g. 
trihalomethanes (THMs). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of 
I-5 
(2) Determination of THMFP 
THMFP of water sample (before and after treatment) was determined by following the 
Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). In absence of light, all water samples (300 mL each) 
were chlorinated using free chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) followed by the addition of 
buffer solution (pH 7.0 ± 0.2) at 25 ± 2 oC for 168 h. The residual chlorine was quenched by 
ascorbic acid, and then the water samples were collected for the determination of THMs 
immediately. 
2.3 Treatment schemes  
(1) Coagulation experiments 
A series of jar tests were carried out. The water samples were introduced into each of 
five 800-mL beakers. Keeping pH constant for each solutions (using 1 M NaOH and 1 M 
H2SO4), alum was added. The mixtures were then allowed to rapid mixing for 1.5 min at 
100 rpm followed by a slow mixing at 30 rpm for 15 minutes, and then were allowed to 
settle for 1 h on the bench top before sampling the supernatants for DOC, turbidity and 
UV254, SUVA and THMs measurements. Generally, at a pH of 5 and an alum dosage of 20 
to 100 mg/L are sufficient to remove DOC (White et al., 1997).  
(2) Ozonation experiments 
Gaseous ozone was generated by an ozone generator (Ozone System Model RXO-15S, 
Ozonair) and introduced immediately into de-ionized water using a diffuser at the bottom of 
the reactor until reaching its equilibrium aqueous concentration in the range of 20-23 mg/L 
at 4 oC. The ozone dosage between 0.4 and 0.8 mg O3/mg DOC were introduced to aid the 
coagulation in NOM and turbidity removal (Singer, 1990). The ozone-saturated solution 
was then introduced into the pre-pH (5, 7, and 9) adjusted source water samples separately 
in 5 L volumetric flasks. After ozonation for 40 min, the residual DOC, UV254, and turbidity 
were measured. 
2.4 Model development for DOC reduction via coagulation 
To understand the characteristics effects of NOM on DOC reduction via coagulation 
process, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of NOM contains in Tai-hu lake water 
were separated by DAX-8 resin. Adsorption of various fractions, namely hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic, of NOM onto aluminum hydroxide during coagulation was studied. Results 
were analyzed based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model with following the 
assumptions bellow (Kastl et al., 2004): 
(1) DOC removal is mainly due to adsorption onto metal hydroxide producing flocs during 
coagulation. 
(2) DOC consists of three fractions viz., humic acid (adsorption associated with pH), 
nonpolar (adsorption irrespective with pH), and nonsorbable (not removed during 
I-7 
reach the optimum pH than lower alkalinity water (White et al., 1997). After separation of 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions from NOM using resin column, characterization viz., 
pH, turbidity, and alkalinity was done for every different water samples. The hydrophilic 
(~25-35％) and the hydrophobic (~65-75％) fractions of the NOM in the lake water sample 
were analyzed and tabulated in Table 3-1. Analyzed data provide a very important feature to 
explain the NOM reduction by coagulation.

3.2 Pre-ozonation/coagulation 
Table 3-2 summarizes the effect of pre-ozonation on turbidity removal by coagulation at 
different pH and ozone dosage. Note that τo is the turbidity after ozonation and prior to 
coagulation. The residual turbidity was less than 2.0 NTU in most cases, except at τo of 16.8 
NTU treated by pre-ozonation (O3/DOC = 0.15 mg/mg) at pH 5. It is also noticeable that 
turbidity removal efficiency was found be ~ 75% when τo was less than 5 NTU. Results 
clearly showed that the residual turbidity decreased significantly after ozonation followed 
by 1 h post-coagulation especially at pH 5 and at low ozone concentration. Ozone dosage 
and pH could also be effective for turbidity removal by coagulation. 
Figure 3-1 shows the DOC removal efficiency by alum coagulation as affected by 
pre-ozonation at three different pH values viz., 5, 7 and 9 and at various ozone dosages viz., 
0.15-0.85 mg O3/mg DOC, respectively. Low DOC removal was observed at low pH (~5). 
No significant difference in DOC removal was observed when Al/DOC ratio was less than 
0.6 mg/mg but DOC removal was remarkably affected when Al/DOC ratio was greater than 
0.6 mg/mg. For instance, when the coagulant dose was increased from 0.2 to 0.9 
mg-Al/mg-DOC, the DOC removal efficiency was increased from ~9 to ~14% at pH 5, ~7 
to ~30% at pH 7 and ~6 to ~34% at pH 9 ( Fig. 3-1c).  
DOC removal efficiency was suppressed at pH 5, when O3/DOC ratio was increased as 
shown in Figure 3-1. At high Al/DOC ratio, e.g. > 0.6 mg/mg and pH 5, DOC removal 
without pre-ozonated media was found to be significantly higher than that of pre-ozonated 
media at 0.45 and 0.85 mg O3/mg DOC. Results also indicated that there was no significant

3.3 Effects of pre-ozonation on hydrophobic/hydrophilic NOM reduction via coagulation 
Figure 3-3 shows the results of DOC removal by coagulation as a function of alum 
(coagulant) dose due to the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fraction in NOM. 
Obtained result suggested that DOC removal due to hydrophobic fraction was in the range 
of ~27 to ~41% when the Al/DOC ratio was increased from 0.41 to 1.65 mg/mg. In contrast, 
DOC removal was low for the hydrophilic fraction and increased from ~2.5 to ~22.7% 
when Al/DOC ratio was increased from 0.58 to 2.93 mg/mg, respectively. It was observed 
that DOC removal was also slightly increased by coagulation for both forms of hydrophobic 
and hydrophilic fractions of NOM when the media was pre-ozonated with an ozone dosage 
of 0.45 mg O3/mg DOC and at pH 9. The difference in DOC removal between hydrophilic 
and hydrophobic NOM was noticed as much as ~18%, which implies that the hydrophobic 
organic fractions are more easily removed than the hydrophilic organics by coagulation 
process (Yan et al., 2007). 
Figures 3-4 and 3-5 show the FTIR spectra of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of 
NOM before and after ozonation, respectively. The major absorption peaks and the 
corresponding functional groups as shown in Fig. 3-4 appeared at 3455 (-OH stretch 
from –COOH and -COH) and 1635 nm (-C=C, -C=O, -COO), and 1600 nm region of the 
spectrum suggests the aromatic carbon adsorption on sorbent (Eltantawy and Baverez, 1978; 
MacCarthy and Rice, 1985; Lobartini, and Tan, 1988; Davis et al., 1999) which in turn 
indicates the hydrophobic organics mainly composed of humic acids. After ozonation, the 
peaks of -OH and –C=C, -C=O were enlarged. Results clearly showed the effect of 
ozonation on oxidative cleavage of large molecules with increase in polar and acidic 
functional groups. The increase of DOC removal during coagulation with pre-ozonation 
could be attributed to enhancement in coordination between the carboxylic group and the 
aluminum nuclei (Lu et al., 1999). 
Figure 3-5 shows the main peaks of hydrophilic fractions of NOM exists in water 
sample and appeared at the wavelength of 3432, 1633, 1477, 1152 and 601 nm with the 
corresponding functional groups of -OH, -C=C, -C=O, -CH in alkanes, -C-O and carboxylic 
group, respectively. Peaks at wavelength of 1100 and 620 nm were likely to be small 
organic molecules. As shown in Fig. 3-5, the hydrophilic functional groups after ozonation 
remained nearly unchanged which suggests that ozonation should not alter the chemical 
characteristics of the hydrophilic fractions of NOM. As a result, coagulation with and 
without pre-ozonation had an insignificant influence on the removal of hydrophilic fraction 
of NOM (Fig. 3-3)

Chemical characteristics of NOM in the lake water samples might have changed due to 
pre-ozonation producing the nonpolar groups and is shown in Table 3-3. Results in Table 3-3 
shows the adsorption variables a and b which indicated that “a” values were evaluated during 
coagulation process after pre-ozonation, because ozonation helps to increase the acidic functional 
groups of NOM and favors the adsorption by coagulant. In comparison of hydrophobic fraction 
and total water samples, the hydrophilic fraction posses the lowest value of “a” (0.48 mg 
DOC/meq alum) which is inversely proportional to the nonsorbable group. Since the hydrophobic 
fraction of NOM can approach ~70% in Tai-hu lake water, the model parameters associated with 
the raw water are very similar to the hydrophobic component of NOM as shown in Table 3-3.  
In order to compare the obtained model parameters of Tai-hu lake water sample with the 
Thomas Lake (in the U.S.) water sample, the Thomas Lake water parameters were evaluated 
(Table 3-3). The lowering value of “a” (Langmuir isotherm constant) for the Thomas Lake water 
sample suggested that removal efficiency of DOC is low during coagulation process. It may be 
due to the having of similar characteristics viz., lowest humic acid group and the highest 
nonsorbable group as they were in the Tai-hu lake water sample. Results in Table 3 suggested that 
the Houston Lake water characteristics were also similar to that of raw water from Tai-hu lake, 
because they have the same levels of “f” and adsorption capacity. This evidence is very important 
to understand the nature of water samples, i.e., the SUVA (1.88) and alkalinity (64 mg/L as 
CaCO3) in Houston Lake are very close to the SUVA (1.84) and alkanility (67.2 mg/L as CaCO3) 
of raw water from Tai-hu lake (Shankar et al., 2001). 
The obtained experimental data of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of Tai-hu lake water 
and synthetic water (humic acid, tannic acid, resorcinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid) were utilized 
to fit in Kastl’s model and were compared as shown in Table 3-3. It was noted that the fnonsorb 
increased as the MW of the target compound decreased, which suggests that NOM with lower 
MW should be hard to remove during coagulation. The “fnonsorb” in resorcinol and 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid samples are similar to that in hydrophilic fractions which indicates that 
the resorcinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid samples are relatively hydrophilic (Chang et al., 2007). 
Table 3-3 compares the parameters in Kastl’s model fitted by the experimental data 
determined for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of Tai-hu lake and synthetic waters 
(e.g., humic acid, tannic acid). It was also noted that the fnonsorb increased as the MW (molecular 
weight) of the target compound decreased, which suggests that NOM with lower MW should be 
hard to remove during coagulation. The “fnonsorb” in resorcinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid 
samples are similar to that in hydrophilic fractions which indicates that the resorcinol and 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid samples are relatively hydrophilic (Chang et al., 2007). 
In general, the adsorption behavior between DOC and hydroxide of coagulant can be described 
by the Langmuir isotherm model. In this research, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic organics were 
separated and considered as two different distinct groups of organics exist in water samples. The 
data were obtained by first isolating the NOM into hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions which 
were then treated by the coagulation process. The parameters “a” and “b” for Tai-hu lake water 
and hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of Tai-hu water shown in Table 3-3 were utilized to 
develop the non-competition model (Eq. (3)) for predicting DOC removal during coagulation.

Table 3-6 gives the results of residual DOC and THMFP before and after coagulation with 
pre-ozonation. The residual DOCs of two different treatments at various alum dosages were 
almost similar to each other, but the specific THMFP was reduced significantly. Results indicated 
that the major factor affecting THMs formation was not only due to the concentration of DOC 
that remained after pre-ozonation, but also the SUVA. Results also indicated the reduction of 
THMFP from 467 to 244 µg/L at 100 mg/L alum dosage was due to treatment of raw water by 
coagulation without pre-ozonation. The removal of THMFP and DOC was ~48 and ~48%, 
respectively, without pre-ozonation. However, it was observed that pre-ozonation DOC removal 
decreased slightly by ~4% (e.g., 44 versus 48%), and THMFP removal was increased 
significantly by ~16% (e.g., 48 versus 64%) at a coagulant dose of 100 mg/L.

THMFP removal with and without pre-ozonation of the coagulant (100 mg/L) was observed 
as ~44 and ~63% which was an increase of ~16% due to pre-ozonation. As coagulation of 
hydrophilic fraction of NOM affected by pre-ozonation, a little difference in THMFP reduction 
was observed. Pre-ozonation has already been proven to be effective in degrading the 
hydrophobic fractions of NOM including aromatic compounds with respect to the formation of 
THMs (Marhaba et al., 2000). However, aliphatic carbons in hydrophilic organics can also be 
reacting with chlorine and bromide for the generation of aliphatic bromo- and chloro-compounds, 
which cannot be easily removed by ozonation. It was thus concluded that pre-ozonation removed 
the THM precursors from the hydrophobic fraction more effectively than the hydrophilic groups.

observed that pre-ozonated media is very affective and efficient for the remediation of 
hydrophobic (THMFP, decreased by ~20%) species than hydrophilic one (~10%). It was 
concluded that pre-ozonation improved the removal of THMs by coagulation most favorably via 
the hydrophobic fraction of NOM.

high ozone dose of 25.0 mg O3 min-1, the formation of DCAN and BCAN can be reduced 
significantly. Moreover, the formation of HKs and TCNM changed due to ozonation prior to 
chlorination. Chlorination of ozonated water formed high concentration of HKs (e.g., the 
maximum concentration of 1, 1-DCP and 1, 1, 1-TCP were 8-10 and 31-48 µg L-1, respectively); 
however, continuous hydrolysis at longer reaction time decreased the formation of HKs rapidly. 
Ozonation prior to chlorination increased the TCNM formation significantly (e.g., 30-50 µg L-1 
after 168 h reaction); there was a good correlation between TCNM formation and ozone dosage, 
indicating that TCNM formation increased with increasing ozone dosage. The result implied that 
the formation of TCNM and HKs formation in the combined ozonation and chlorination 
processes should be of great concern.

1. Introduction   
 Low cost and high disinfection efficiency for eliminating pathogenic microorganisms in the 
raw water chlorine has been widely used as disinfectant in the conventional water treatment 
plants. However, it has been reported that chlorine can react with organic matters in the raw water 
to form halogenated disinfection by-products (DBPs). There has much attention on the formation 
and control of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation and control due 
to the high concentration presented in the chlorinated water (Chiang et al., 2002; Chang et al., 
2004; Bekbolet et al., 2005). 
Haloacetonitriles (HANs), halonitromethanes (HNMs) and haloketones (HKs) have also 
been found in the chlorinated water. HANs and HNMs were two typical nitrogenous DBPs 
(N-DBPs). Even though these DBPs were present at low concentrations, they are also more 
carcinogenic and mutagenic than the regulated DBPs, THMs and HAAs being regulated widely 
around the world (Plewa et al., 2004; Muellner et al., 2007). HKs have also been found to be 
carcinogenic and mutagenic to mice (Bull and Robinson, 1986). Among HNMs, 
trichloronitromethane (TCNM) was commonly investigated previously (Jacangelo et al., 1989; 
Lee et al., 2001; Hua and Reckhow, 2007; Yang et al., 2008). Regulatory limits, based on health 
risk, of HANs, HKs, and TCNM have not been established globally due to lack of toxicity data, 
and potential human health effects of these DBPs. Krasner et al. (1989) investigated the effluents 
of 35 water utilities of United State, and found that there was a high correlation between TTHM 
and the sum of halogenated DBPs (r2 = 0.92). However, the correlation between TTHM and 
non-TTHM DBPs was lower (r2 = 0.58). Oliver (1983) showed the results that the average molar 
concentration of DHANs (the sum of DCAN and BCAN) was about 10% of the average molar 
concentration of THM. Lee et al. (2001) investigated chlorinated DBPs including THMs, HAAs, 
HANs, and HKs etc. from 35 water treatment plants in Korea, and the results showed that the 
portions of DBPs in the investigation were THMs of 40-50%, HAAs of 28-35% and HANs of 
9-15%, respectively, and the strong correlation between HANs and HKs were also found. 
There are several factors affecting DBPs formation during chlorination or chloramination 
including chlorine doses, reaction time, pH, temperature, aqueous nitrogen concentration, 
bromide concentration etc. The influences of the water treatment efficiencies and water qualities

The DOC concentration was much higher than the water quality standard of 4 mg L-1 for drinking 
water source in Taiwan. Due to high concentration of organic precursors in Tai Lake, it is 
expected that the source water will yield high DBPs formation potential (DBPFP) would be 
occurred during chlorination process. Furthermore, the presence of nitrogenous compounds 
would cause the formation of DBPs (e.g. HANs, TCNM).

2.2 Chlorination process 
Chlorination of the water sample was conducted to evaluate the DBPs formation potential 
for Tai Lake raw water in this study. The major chlorinated DBPs investigated in this study 
include THMs, HANs, HKs and TCNM. The baseline chlorination experiment was conducted in 
accordance with the procedures specified in the Standard Method 5710 B (APHA, 2005). 
Samples (300 mL for each) were chlorinated by free chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) stock 
solution with chlorine dose of 5 mg Cl2 (mg DOC)-1, e.g. 40 mg L-1 as Cl2 of raw water 
chlorination. The chlorination process used in this study was similar to Reckhow et al. (1990). 
The chlorinated samples were buffered by phosphate buffer (pH 7.0 ± 0.2) and kept headspace 
free in the dark at 20 ± 2 oC for appropriate reaction time. After chlorination, the residual chlorine 
was quenched by ammonium chloride, and then the samples were collected to measure the DBPs 
concentration. 
The orthogonal matrix experiment design for investigating the factors affecting DBPs 
formation was used. The factors include reaction time, chlorine dosage, pH, ammonium and 
organic nitrogen concentration. The factors include reaction time, chlorine dosage, pH, 
ammonium and organic nitrogen concentration. In the experiment, while one factor was varied to 
evaluate its effect on chlorination, the other factors were kept at constant. The range of variation 
for various factors are: reaction time (1-168 h), chlorine dosage (10-40 mg L-1 as Cl2), pH (6-9), 
ammonium concentration (1-3 mg L-1 as N) and organic nitrogen (1-3 mg L-1 as N). Glycine was 
used as the mainly additive organic nitrogen because glycine contained the simplest structure of 
amino acids and widely presented in natural water as well as in cellular materials (Shang et al., 
2000).

process to form the corresponding PFBHA-oximes in accordance with Standard Method 6252 
(APHA, 2005). After derivatization, the derivatives were extracted by n-hexane with internal 
standard (1, 2-dibromopropane of 20 mg L-1). The GC (Varian 3000) coupled with EI-MS (Varian 
2100) was used to determine the PFBHA-oximes. The sample volume of 1 µL was injected into 
the capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm VF-5ms, Varian, USA). The temperature 
program included initial 35 oC for 4 min, ramping to 101 oC at 9 oC min-1 for 5 min, ramping to 
221 oC for 5 min, and finally to 250 oC at 15 oC min-1. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Factors affecting chlorinated DBPs formation during chlorination 
3.1.1 Time dependent chlorinated DBPs formation during chlorination 
Chlorinated DBPs include THMs, HANs, HKs and TCNM. A long-term chlorination 
experiment was conducted to show the formation of DBPs as a function of reaction time. The 
chlorine dose of 40 mg L-1 as Cl2 (Cl2/DOC = 5) was applied to the Tai Lake source water 
buffered at pH 7. 
Figure 3-1 shows the formation of THM during the 7-day chlorination period. A fast 
formation of THM was observed during the first 24 h followed by a second stage of slow 
formation. The formation of DCBM and DBCM followed similar trend as that of chloroform at 
the end of the first 24 h but the reaction rate were slower than TCM and remained constant after 
24 h. TCM was a predominant THM species, and had a concentration as high as 430 µg L-1 after 
168-h of chlorination. DCAN and BCAN are the main HANs studied. There was no detection of 
the TCAN during the chlorination of the Tai Lake raw water. Figure 3-2 shows that DCAN and 
BCAN reached the maximum concentration within the first day before undergoing hydrolysis as 
the reaction time was extended. Results agreed with what was reported by Zhang et al. (2009). 
The decay rate of DCAN was low as reported by Yang et al. (2007) because the disinfectant used 
in their study was chloramine which oxidant capacity was lower than that of free chlorine. 
However, the DCAN decay rate was also low in Korshin et al. (2002) study. The formation of 
TCNM during chlorination of Tai Lake raw water was quite low with a formation concentration 
of < 5 µg L-1 during the entire reaction period of 168 h. Joo and Mitch (2007) indicated that the 
TCNM formation was minor comparing with other DBPs during chlorination. 1, 1- DCP and 1, 1, 
1-TCP were the HKs investigated. The trend of HKs formation was similar to HAN. Figure 4-2-3 
shows that the formation of 1, 1-DCP and 1, 1, 1-TCP reached their maximum levels at 24-hr 
before both species began to undergo hydrolysis and oxidation reaction when the reaction time 
was prolonged. Reckhow and Singer (1985) reported that the chlorination of fulvic acid could 
lead to the formation of intermediate by-products such as 1, 1-DCP, and 1, 1, 1-TCP. These 
by-products could be further oxidized by chlorine to 1, 1, 1-TCP, of which chloroform would be 
one of the hydrolysis products. Nikoloau et al. (2001) investigated the decomposition of HKs in 
waters, and the result showed that the decomposition of 1, 1, 1-TCP were higher than that of 1, 
1-DCP in both ultrapure and drinking water. Chloroform was also found, and the formation was 
higher in ultrapure than in drinking water. The results suggest that the decomposition of HKs in 
drinking water media lead to formation of chloroform (Nikoloau et al., 2001), additionally.

Figure 3-3 Time-dependent HKs formation during chlorination for Tai Lake raw water. 
Experimental condition: DOC: 8 mg L-1, pH: 7 and chlorine dose: 40 mg L-1 as Cl2. 
3.1.2 Factors affecting HANs, HKs and TCNM formation 
Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of chlorine dosage, pH, ammonia, and 
organic nitrogen concentrations. 
Figure 3-4 shows the formation of HANs, TCNM and HKs as a function of chlorine dosages 
in Tai Lake source water buffered at pH 7. TCAN was not detected under all four chlorine 
dosages. The formation of DCAN peaked at chlorine dosage of 20 mg L-1 as Cl2, but the 
formation of BCAN increased with increase in chlorine dosage. Yang et al. (2007) investigated 
the formation of DCAN and found that DCAN formation increased linearly with increase in 
monochloramine doses. This is because DCAN, in the presence of mono-chloramine, was more 
stable than in free chlorine solutions (Yang et al., 2007). It appears that higher chlorine dosages 
brought about higher formation of TCNM. The formation of 1, 1-DCP was erratic with chlorine 
dosage, and the formation of 1, 1, 1-TCP increased monotonously with increase in chlorine dose 
from 10 to 30 mg L-1 as Cl2.

Figure 3-6 The zones for the predominant pathway and half-lives for DCAN decomposition at 20 
oC (Reckhow et al., 2001). 
Figure 3-7 shows the trend of the formation of HANs at various ammonia concentrations. The 
formation of DCAN increased with increasing ammonia concentration from 1 to 3 mg L-1 as N, 
but decreased when the ammonia concentration was higher than 3 mg L-1 as N. The maximum 
concentration of BCAN occurred at the ammonia concentration of 2.1 mg L-1 as N. The 
formation of chloramines caused by chlorine reaction with ammonia could be expressed as the 
following stages (Snoeyink and Jenkins, 1982): 
OHClNHHOClNH aq 22)(3 +→+                                           Eq. (4-2-1) 
OHNHClHOClClNH 222 +→+                                           Eq. (4-2-2) 
OHNClHOClNHCl 232 +→+                                             Eq. (4-2-3) 
According to the proposed pathway for the formation of DBPs during chloramination 
studied by Yang et al. (2008), the structure of RCOCH2COR’ (R, R’ = functional group) of NOM 
would react with mono-chloroamine to form ClNHCCl2COR’ and then the DCAN would be 
further produced through this pathway. Because the chlorine consumption increased rapidly with 
increasing ammonia concentration due to the fast reaction of ammonia and chlorine (the apparent 
rate constant at pH 7 was 1.3 × 104 M-1 s-1 (Deborde and Gunten, 2008)). The increase of 
ammonia concentration led to a lower residual chlorine after chlorination. The formation of 
chloramines from ammonia nitrogen presented in the raw water also provided nitrogen necessary 
for the formation of HANs. However, when ammonia concentration was higher than 3 mg L-1 as 
N, the decline of HANs was observed. The formation of TCNM decreased with increasing 
ammonia concentration. The formations of HKs remained relatively unchanged when ammonia 
concentration increased from 0.8 to 3.1 mg L-1 as N. When the ammonia concentration was 
higher than 3.1 mg L-1 as N, the decline of 1, 1, 1-TCP was also observed.

3.2 Effects of pre-ozonation on the control of NOM and DBPs formation 
3.2.1 NOM reduction with pre-ozonation 
Table 3-1 shows the results of NOM reduction during pre-ozonation. The reduction of DOC 
was lower when ozone doses were low. Even at high ozone dose, e.g. 25 mg O3 min-1, DOC 
reduction was just around 70%. UV254 is a surrogate organic matter with aromatic structures or 
conjugated double bonds. In general, ozonation resulted in a higher reduction efficiency of UV254. 
The higher reduction in UV254 and the comparatively lower reduction in DOC suggest that the 
chemical structure of NOM changed by ozonation. But, the mineralization of the organic matters 
proceeded at a lower rate (Chin and Bérubé, 2005). Furthermore, the SUVA value was defined as 
the ratio of UV254 to DOC in the raw water. Decrease in SUVA means changes of NOM structure 
from aromatic or conjugated double bond to the non-aromatic or polar ones.

3.3.3 Chlorinated DBPs formation during pre-ozonation/chlorination processes 
Pre-ozonation prior to chlorination could reduce the chlorine demand. The chlorine demand 
after 168-h chlorination of raw water and ozonated water for ozone dose of 9.5, 12.5 and 31.1 mg 
Lg-1 were 26.2, 16.4, 17.1 and 13.1 mg L-1 as Cl2, respectively. Figure 3-10 shows the effects of 
pre-ozonation on the formation of TTHMs during chlorination. Pre-ozonation could reduce the 
THMs formation potential (THMFP). The reduction of TTHMFP was 37, 48 and 77%, 
respectively, for the applied ozone of 8.0, 10.0 and 25.0 mg O3 min-1. Figure 4-3-3 shows the 
specific TTHM formation, and results indicated slightly higher TTHM formation in the ozonated 
water especially at low ozone dose. This suggests that the ozonaiton will change the 
characteristics of NOM and form the precursors that are easier to form TTHMs at low ozone 
doses; whereas, a further increase in ozone dose could destroy the organic matters to form 
TTHMs. The specific TTHMs formation could be increased by pre-ozonation process at low 
ozone doses. 
Figure 3-12 shows the effects of pre-ozonation on the formation of HANs (DCAN + BCAN) 
during chlorination. After pre-ozonation at low applied ozone dose, i.e., 8.0 and 10.0 mg O3 min-1, 
the formation of HANs is lower than that without pre-ozonation at the first 24 h. There was little 
decrease in HANs during chlorination following pre-ozonation at low ozone dosages, however. 
The result indicates that there was higher concentration of HANs after 168 h of chlorination. The 
first-order rate constants of HAN decay during chlorination following pre-ozonation at low 
applied ozone dose of 8.0 and 10.0 mg O3 min-1 was both 0.004 h-1 which were lower than that of 
raw water chlorination (0.019 h-1). At high applied ozone dose of 25.0 mg O3 min-1, a significant 
decline of the HANs formation was observed. The specific HANs formation, shown in Fig. 4-3-4, 
indicates that a significant increase in the formation of HANs after a longer chlorination process 
of the ozonated water at low ozone doses. Figure 3-12 also shows that at high applied ozone dose

Figure 3-13 Comparison of the specific HANs formation between without and with pre-ozonation. 
(Chlorine doses for raw water and ozonated water were 40 and 20 mg L-1 as Cl2, 
respectively). 
The TCNM formation increased significantly during chlorination following pre-ozonation 
and the formation increased with increase in ozone doses as shown in Fig. 3-14. The TCNM 
formation was low during the chlorination of raw water without pre-ozonation (below 5 µg L-1). 
However, the formation concentration of TCNM increased from 26.5 to 52.6 µg L-1 with 
increasing applied ozone doses from 8.0 to 25.0 mg O3 min-1. The formation potential of TCNM 
is a function of O3 doses as shown in Fig. 3-15. TCNM formation had little difference on the 
THM formation. TCNM formation reaches its maximum concentration around 48 h reaction time 
and then tends to be stabilized at longer reaction time as shown in Figs. 3-14 and 3-15. The 
evidence shows that TCNM formation was limited to the situation there were supplies of nitrous 
 II-19  
 
Figure 3-16 Comparison of specific TCNM formation between without and with pre-ozonation. 
(Chlorine doses for raw water and ozonated water were 40 and 20 mg L-1 as Cl2, 
respectively). 
Pre-ozonation had significant impact on the formation of HKs also (Fig. 3-17). The amount 
of HKs formation was much higher at initial reaction time of chlorination following 
pre-ozonation than that without pre-ozonation due to the formation of ketones during ozonation 
(Xie, 2004). The convex shape of the 1, 1, 1-TCP formation curve at the first 2 h chlorination is 
shown in Fig. 3-18. The Figure also shows that the relationship between 1, 1-DCP formation and 
ozone doses insignificant. This observation may indicate that the HK precursors, e.g. ketones, 
could lead to the formation of 1, 1-DCP which would further be converted to 1, 1, 1-TCP rapidly. 
At high applied ozone dose of 25.0 mg O3 min-1, the formation of HKs at first reaction decreased 
due to the decrease in propanone formation during pre-ozonation.  The formation potential is 
further reduced due to the hydrolysis or oxidation reaction. In spite of high formation of HKs at 
beginning chlorination time, further hydrolysis or oxidation occurred at longer reaction time. As 
shown in Fig. 3-17, formation of HKs after 168 h chlorination was insignificant regardless 
witothout or with pre-ozonation at low ozone doses. According to Fig. 3-17, the degradation rates 
of HKs during chlorination following pre-ozonation were higher than that without pre-ozonation. 
The analysis of the first-order reaction kinetics was performed to evaluate the hydrolysis behavior 
or further oxidation of HKs. The first-order decay constant of HKs were 0.006, 0.013, 0.014, and 
0.018 h-1, respectively, during chlorination without and with pre-ozonation for the applied ozone 
doses of 8.0, 10.0 and 25.0 mg O3 min-1.

Figure 3-19 Comparison of specific HKs formation between without and with pre-ozonation. 
(Chlorine doses for raw water and ozonated water were 40 and 20 mg L-1 as Cl2, 
respectively). 
According to the results mentioned above, the formation of DBPs was affected by 
chlorination following pre-ozonation. Under chlorination at pH 7, the chlorine contact time 
should be properly determined to evaluate the effect of pre-ozonation on the formation of DBPs. 
Table 4-3-4 shows the DBPs formation at various chlorine contact time following the 
pre-ozonation. Ozonation could reduce the formation of THMs but enhance HANs and TCNM at 
the low ozone doses. The reduction of HKFP was insignificant at low ozone doses. At high ozone 
dosage, chlorinated DBPs studied include THMs HANs and HKs which were decreased 
significantly except for TCNM. Enhancement of the formation of HKs was observed at 1 and 24 
h reaction time due to the formation of high HKs precursor by ozonation. Enhancement of TCNM 
formation was observed at 1, 24 and 168 h reaction time, however. It should be noted that the 
TCNM formation varied with ozone dosage which increased with increase in ozone dosages. 
Although pre-ozonation could destroy the DBPFP, i.e., THMFP, it would also enhance other 
by-products formation, e.g. TCNM, during chlorination. The high formation of TCNM causes 
human health concern regarding the safety of drinking water.

4 Conclusion 
The formation of HANs, TCNM and HKs during the chlorination process of the Tai Lake raw 
water were investigated. It was observed that formation of HANs, and HKs with during a long 
chlorine time process reach the maximum concentration before undergoing hydrolysis. However, 
the formation of TCNM was insignificant with a fairly low concentration (< 5 µg L-1) measured 
within the whole chlorination process. Chlorine dose and pH affect the formations of HANs, 
TCNM and HKs. A formation curve of DCAN with a convex shape was observed with different 
chlorine doses. It was observed that the formation of 1, 1, 1-TCP increased with increasing 
chlorine doses. The formation of DCAN, BCAN and 1, 1, 1-TCP decreased exponentially with 
increasing pHs. Contrarily, TCNM formation increased when pH increased. Moreover, the 
concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and DON also affect the HANs, HKs and TCNM formation.  
The high UV254 reduction and relatively low DOC reduction by ozonation suggested that 
ozone could significantly change the chemical properties from humic to non-humic or polar 
substances. However, the undesired ozonation by-products were also formed during the ozonation 
process such as aldehydes and ketones. The ozonated by-products found in this study include 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, methyl-glyoxal and propanone. The formation of ozonation 
by-products increased with the increase of ozone doses from 8.0 to 10.0 mg O3 min-1. However, a 
further increase in ozone dose to 25.0 mg O3 min-1 decreased the formations of aldehydes and 
ketone significantly. 
Ozonation prior to chlorination could change the reactions of HANs, TCNM and HKs during 
chlorination significantly. The DCAN and BCAN formations in the ozonated water (at low ozone 
doses, 8.0 and 10.0 mg O3 min-1) were reduced, but the low hydrolysis rate of HANs caused 
higher residual concentrations of DCAN and BCAN than that of raw water after the 168 h 
chlorination process. At high ozone dose of 25.0 mg O3 min-1, the formation of HANs was 
insignificant. The formations of HKs and TCNM were greatly affected by the pre-ozonation prior 
to the the chlorination process. The combination of ozonation and chlorination processes is 
important to the HKs and TCNM formations due to the ozonated precursors formation. Although 
there were high formation concentrations of HKs within six hours reaction, hydrolysis behaviors 
at longer reaction time reduced their concentrations. Ozonation prior to chlorination caused high 
TCNM formation greatly. The good correlation between TCNM formation and ozone dosage 
suggests that TCNM formation increased with increasing ozone dosages.  
Although the combination of pre-ozonation and chlorination reduce the formations of THMs 
and HAAs which are regulated DBPs with drinking water standards, these two processes enhance 
the formations of HKs and TCNM which may cause other health concern.
