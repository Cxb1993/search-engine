carbon sequestration potential of
municipal wastewater treatment using
aerobic processes. Use of anaerobic
processes for extracting carbon
pollutants in wastewater to biofuel
energy clearly better fit this need
(Greenfield and Batstone, 2005, Hartley
and Lant, 2006, Urban et al., 2007).
Anaerobic processes have been
employed over the last few decades in
industrial wastewater treatment. The
processes have attracted increasing
attention owing to their capability of
energy production in the form of biogas.
Many systems have been developed to
treat a variety of wastewaters. The
systems which base on anaerobic
granular sludge appear to be the most
promising, especially in treating high
strength wastewaters. These reactor
systems provide efficient and stable
operational performance, attributable to
its effective retention of the fast settling
granules associated with high biomass
concentration and rich microbial
diversity. Anaerobic granular systems
are designed in wastewater treatment to
maximize biomass retention and
methane yield. Methane - a greenhouse
gas, can be effectively captured and
reused rendering great potential for the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
initiatives under Kyoto Protocol. Under
CDM project implementation, ‘Carbon 
Credit’ represents the amount of 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
from an emission source (Fig. 1). To
improve treatment efficiency and to
claim carbon credits, many existing
aerobic and low-rate anaerobic treatment
such as those pond systems have been
upgraded to anaerobic granular-sludge
systems.
Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are
major intermediate products in
acidogenesis and acetogenesis stages of
anaerobic biochemical degradation.
Main VFA components in anaerobic
digestion are acetate, propionate and
butyrate. The stability of overall
biochemical reactions relied on the
degradation of VFA by the anaerobes to
the final gaseous products. Under
favourable condition, more than 75% of
acetate can be converted to methane
(Mountfort and Asher, 1978; Gujer and
Zehnder, 1983; Zinder, 1993). Butyrate
degradation differs from that with acetate
as it includes acetogenesis step in the
biochemical reactions. Conversion of
butyrate to acetate is not
thermodynamically favorable unless the
acetate and hydrogen produced by the
acetogens can be readily removed by
acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic
bacteria respectively (Gujer & Zehnder,
1983).
NTUINCENTIVE: CARBON CREDIT GAIN
Incentive
Figure 1 Illustrative abatement
for incentive for carbon credits for
low-cost treatment processes.
In UASB reactor, bacteria
aggregate to form biogranules which
have high microbial activity. However,
formation of granules relies on the
syntrophic association of various bacteria
groups (Fang et al., 1994). Samsoon, et
al. (1987, 1991) also speculated that
granulation was much depends on
hydrogenotrophic bacteria. Thus,
butyrate may become a preferable
substrate compared with acetate for
anaerobic sludge to form granule, since
the hydrogen formed via degradation can
be further utilized by hydrogenotrophic
bacteria.
the Standard Methods (APHA, 1998)
Section 2540D and 2540E. COD
measurements were carried out
according to the Standard Methods
(APHA, 1998) Section 5220 D. pH was
measured by a pH meter (WTW pH
meter pH-315). Biogas production was
recorded daily by water displacement
method. The biogas composition was
determined using a gas chromatography
(Shimadzu, GC-9A) equipped with a
thermal conductivity detector and
column packed with Molecular sieve 5A
80/100 mesh. The oven temperature was
set at 70°C and helium was used as
carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min-1.
Gas composition was calibrated by
standard gas (methane, nitrogen and
carbon dioxide) and calculated according
to the area recorded on the chromatropic
integrator (Shimadzu C-R3A).
Compositions of VFAs were determined
using a High Performance Liquid
Chromatograph System (Ecom LCP
4100 Pump, LCD 2083 Detector) with
auto sampler (hta HT3000L). Detector
wavelength was set at 210nm and the
mobile phase was set at pH 2.5. Each
sample was tested in triplicate.
Outcome
1. UASB Reactor Performance
We will monitor the biogas
production rates, COD removal rates,
pH and alkalinity, and VFA and alcohol
contents in the liquors. Both the
steady-state and unsteady-state
performances of UASB reactors treating
acetate and butyrate as sole carbon
source.
2 Carbon Balance of Acetate and
Butyrate-fed Reactors
Carbon in the substrate is
converted into methane and carbon
dioxide in the biogas, TOC, TIC in the
effluent and biomass. The total feed
carbon will be calculated from the carbon
fraction of acetate or butyrate feeding per
day, whereas this carbon released daily in
the biogas, effluent TOC and TIC will be
calculated according. The biomass
generated may be washed out in the
effluent daily or accumulated in the
reactor. The biomass washout will be
measured as VSS. The accumulated
biomass will be calculated by the
subtraction of total outlet carbon from
inlet carbon. The carbon content in the
biomass was calculated by assuming the
empirical formula of microbial cell
C5H7O2, which one gram VSS contains
0.53 gram carbon.
3 Estimation of Net Sludge Yield of
Acetogenic and Methanogenic Bacteria
Degradation of butyrate involved
acetogenesis, aceticlastic
methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic
methanogenesis, as shown in reaction 1,
2 and 3 but degradation of acetate only
involved in reaction 2. By using the mass
balance result shown above, the net
sludge yield of each type of bacteria
involved in the reaction thus can be
estimated.
Butyrate acetogenesis
Aceticlastic methanogenesis
                                                                       …………………………………………………(2)
Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis
                                      ……………………………………………(3)
Daily net sludge yield of acetate-
and butyrate-fed reactor, which equal to
the sums of effluent biomass and
estimated accumulated biomass, will be
45 mg VSS/g acetate COD and 85 mg
VSS/g butyrate COD, respectively.
4. Carbon Credit and Emission Trading
Emission trading is a regulatory
program that allows firms the flexibility
to select cost effective solutions to
achieve established environmental goals,
which are required to reduce worldwide
greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990
levels. Solutions can be achieved by
reducing emissions from a discrete
