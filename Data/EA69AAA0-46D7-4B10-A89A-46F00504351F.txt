the performance was further improved by properly and gradually decreasing the baffled-ring 
distance along the cross-flow channel coupled with properly adjusting the number of baffled 
rings. This theoretical analysis is based on the mass and momentum balances as well as the 
application of the resistance-in-series model. The correlation predictions are confirmed with 
the experimental results for dextran T500 aqueous solution ultrafiltration.

Introduction 
    In cross-flow ultrafiltration, the permeate flux generally declines along the flow channel 
due to the concentration polarization phenomenon by the rejected particles (Nokao et al.,1979; 
Clifton et al., 1984). Recently, several technical approaches developed for reducing the effects 
of concentration polarization and progressive fouling to enhance the permeate flux have been 
thoroughly discussed (Costa et al., 2006; Bhattacharjee and Bhattacharya, 2006; Ghidossi et 
al., 2006; Barbot and Moulin, 2008; Susanto et al., 2008). It was reported that gradually 
increasing the turbulent strength along the flow channel might suitably suppress the 
increasing resistance to permeation due to concentration polarization while properly 
maintaining the decreasing transmembrane pressure (Fontes, 2005; Yeh and Chen, 2006, 2009; 
Elarbi, 2009; Yeh, 2010). The purpose of this study is to investigate the ultrafiltration 
permeate flux improvement in a tubular membrane by inserting a concentric wrapped steel 
rod with baffled rings to enhance the turbulent behavior and, thus, to reduce the ultrafiltration

concentration polarization/gel layer, which will be proportional to the amount and specific 
hydraulic resistance of the compressible layer deposited and may be assumed to be a linear 
function of the transmembrane pressure with   as a proportional constant. The values of 
mR , fR  and   value will be determined experimentally. The local permeate flux J(z)  is 
readily calculated numerically by substituting Eq.(5) and (11) into Eq.(12). The average 
permeate is estimated by Eq.(3) using the iteration method. 
 
Experiment 
Experimental conditions 
 
The experimental apparatus (Fig. 2), materials and procedure were exactly the same as 
those in the previous work (Yeh and Chen, 2000), except that the membrane tube with radius 
mr  of 3 mm and length L of 0.4 mm was inserted with a solid rod of radius )21(krk m  , 
wrapped with (N-1) ring wires of 1 mm diameter. Accordingly, there were N (=1, 5, 10, and 
20) sections between the ring wires, as shown in Fig. 1. The distance between two rings dj at 
the jth section decreases along the steel rod using an arithmetic series with constant difference

the intersection of ordinate ( ) and the slope ( mR + fR ) were determined as function of iu  
and iC .  The correlation equations for   and ( mR + fR ) were constructed using the least 
squares method as a function of iu , iC , N and a/(L/N) with L=0.4 m and N=1, 5, 10, 15, 20,

slightly while, actually, the concentration polarization resistance experimental value obviously 
increases. The average permeate flux increases with the inlet volume flow rate iQ  and 
transmembrane pressure iP , but decreases when the inlet concentration iC  increases. 
 
Effect of (a/L) on concentration-polarization resistance 
 
     At the inlet, the concentration polarization layer thickness is smaller and then increases 
along the flow channel. Therefore, a larger entrance ring-distance (d1/L) for producing smaller 
turbulent strength around the inlet region of a ring-baffle device, is sufficient enough to 
reduce the lower concentration polarization resistance there. In the meantime, a smaller ring 
distance, as well as stronger turbulent behavior, around the outlet region is required for 
suppressing the higher concentration polarization resistance. In this study, we are concerned 
with a device that gradually increases the turbulent behavior along the flow channel by 
gradually decreasing the N ring-baffle distances di using an arithmetic series of constant 
difference a, as defined by Eq.(1). Therefore, the higher concentration polarization resistance 
in the near end of the flow channel will decrease more rapidly by increasing (a/L) to make 
(d1/L) larger and (dN/L) smaller, as indicated by Eqs.(14) and (15). However, for the case of 
larger N and lower iP , the small driving force )P( i  will further decrease when N and 
(a/L) increase, leading to a decrease in the averaged permeate flux, as shown in Figs.5 and 6 
for N=15 and kPa30Pi  , as well as Figs. 8 and 10 for 
210667.1(a/L)   and

transmembrane pressure due to the increase in friction loss. This is bad for ultrafiltration. It 
appears, therefore, that proper turbulent strength adjustment along the flow channel with  
specified operating conditions ,)ΔPandQ,(C iii might effectively suppress any undesirable 
resistance to permeation due to concentration polarization while still preserving an effective 
transmembrane pressure, thereby leading to improved permeate recovery. 
     As seen in Figs.3-6 for higher transmembrane pressure (say kPa)140ΔPi  , the 
average permeate flux J  increases when the baffle-ring distance dj gradually decreases more 
rapidly along the flow channel, as well as when the dimensionless difference in the arithmetic 
series, (a/L), increases. Moreover, J  also increases as N increases. This is because that for 
high transmembrane-pressure operation, either by increasing (a/L) or increasing N, the 
decrease in the resistance to permeation can still compensate for the decrease in 
transmembrane pressure. On the other hand, for operation under lower transmembrane 
pressure (say , the desirable effect no longer compensates for the undesirable 
effect and the permeate flux  decreases when (a/L) or N is larger, especially for lower 
volumetric flow rate, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Accordingly, for specified operating 
conditions , there may exist optimal values for N and/or (a/L) for better permeate 
flux, especially when  are small. 
 
Improvement in performance

Therefore, the increase in operating cost due to the increase in power consumption may be 
ignored. 
Conclusion 
 
     Ultrafiltration in a ring-rod tubular membrane with the proper ring number and properly 
decreasing baffled-ring distance along the tube membrane, was investigated both theoretically 
and experimentally. The ring-rod tubular membrane module was modified from a tubular 
membrane by inserting a steel rod concentrically wrapped with (N-1) baffled rings of 
gradually decreasing ring distance along the module. Ultrafiltration of an aqueous dextrane 
T500 solution in the baffled-ring membrane tube of 0.4 m length (L), with the diameters of 
tube (2rm= 0.006 m), rod (2krm= 0.003 m) and ring wire (0.001 m), was carried out for various 
transmembrane pressures )P( i , feed concentrations (Ci), feed flow rates (Qi), ring number 
(N-1) and ring distances (dj). The total number of baffled rings were fixed at 0, 4, 9, 14 and 19 
(i.e. numbers of the sections between two baffled rings are N=1, 5, 10, 15 and 20) and their 
distances decreased gradually along the module, as indicated by Eqs. (14) and (16). The 
present theoretical analysis is based on the mass and momentum balances coupled with 
resistance-in-series model application. The correlation predictions are scarcely higher than the 
experimental results.                                     
Ultrafiltration in the module of same size inserted with a steal rod but without the 
baffled ring (k=1/2, N=1, a=0), was also carried out for comparison. In general, improvement

Abstract 
     The expressions of heat- and mass-transfer rates in the multipass heat- and mass-exchangers 
derived by the conventional correction-factor analysis are implicit and the results should be 
calculated using try-and-error method. In present study, the modified correction-factor analysis was 
introduced, and the expressions of mass-transfer rate and modified correction-factor charts for 
membrane extraction in parallel-flow multipass rectangular devices thus derived, are explicit. The 
results can be readily calculated without using try-and-error method. The correction factors for 
multipass operations are plotted in the modified correction-factor charts, they are function of flow 
rate, mass-transfer-area, distribution coefficient and overall mass-transfer coefficient. Experimental 
results confirm the predicted values for the extraction of acetic acid from aqueous solution by 
methyl isobutyl ketone in the double-pass device.

2. Theory  
      When solvent extraction is carried out in a microporous membrane device, the membrane is 
generally in contact with two kinds of fluid at two sides (phases a and b) and if fluids a and b are 
miscible, then in the pores of the membrane are filled with another fluid (phase c) which is 
immiscible with these two fluids. The solute is extracted from phase a to c and then to phase b, or 
vice versa [7]. 
2.1. Mass-transfer rate 
      The extraction rate in a rectangular membrane module with length L and width B may be 
expressed from the mass-transfer point of view as  
KBLW  (average concentration difference)                                          (1) 
where K denotes the overall mass-transfer coefficient, while the averaged concentration differences 
between the raffinate (fluid a) and extract (fluid b) phases are varied with the flow patterns and 
membrane systems. For convenience, we may taken the logarithmic mean,  lmC , coupled with 
the correction factor, analogous to heat-transfer in heat exchangers [2,6] as

employed in the conventional correction-factor analysis because there exist the unknown solute 
outlet concentrations in the conventional correction-factor charts. Therefore, the calculation 
procedure for mass-transfer rate in multipass membrane extractors is improved in present study. 
 
3. Experimental performance for double-pass operation 
    The double-pass experiments were carried out with the use of a membrane sheet ( L=B=0.165 
m) made of microporous polypropylene ( Gelman science, average pore size of m2.0 , porosity of 
70% and thickness of m178 ) as a permeable barrier to extract acetic acid (reagent ACS grade, 
Fisher) aqueous solution by methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK, reagent grade, Fisher). The membrane 
sheet was inserted between two horizontal parallel plates of stainless steel, with same distance from 
them to divide the conduit into two channels (channels a and b, or phase a and b) of same height 
) 109.1( 3 mh  . For double-pass membrane extraction, an impermeable plate was placed 
additionally vertical to the upper plate and the membrane sheet at the centerline of channel a to 
divide channel a into two subchannels (subchannels 1a  and 2a ) of height h and width (B/2). Fig. 
8 illustrates the experimental apparatus and operation. 
    The experimental conditions were as follows. Aqueous solution: 
./  2  5.0  ;/ 32.1  88.0 ,44.0 ,22.010 3,
36 mmolkgandCsmandq iaa   Organic solution: 
.0 ;/ 25.010 ,
36  ibb Csmq  Since acetic acid aqueous solution (phase a) and MIBK organic 
solution (phase b) are immiscible, it is not necessary to fill another fluid (phase c) in the membrane 
 12
use the of modified correction chart, Fig. 5 for the comparison with the experimental results. The 
experimental results confirms well with the theoretical prediction for smaller feed 
concentration, 3, / 5.0 mmolkgC ia  , while for larger feed concentration, 3, / kg 2 mmolC ia  , the 
prediction values are rather higher than the experimental results. 
4.2. Advantage of modified correction-factor analysis 
    It is shown in Eq. (69) that for single-pass operation, the logarithmic mean of concentration 
difference defined by Eq. (3) is exactly the average concentration difference, and thus, F=1. 
However, if we still follow the conventional method [1,6] for estimating the overall mass-transfer 
rate W with the use of Eqs. (2) and (3), the try-and-error method should be employed because that 
the outlet solute concentrations, eaC ,  and ebC , , in Eq. (3) are unknown. Nevertheless, there do not 
exist eaC ,  and ebC ,  in the modified equation, Eq. (9), and the values of W for single-pass 
operations are directly calculated merely setting F=1. 
    For the mass-transfer rate in multupass membrane extractors, one maybe better also employing 
the modified equation, Eq. (9), instead of using the conventional equation, Eq. (2). However, if the 
values of F still are determined from the conventional correction-factor charts [1,6], the 
try-and-error method has to be performed because there are the unknown outlet solute 
concentrations, eaC ,  and ebC , , in these conventional charts. Alternately, one may employ the 
modified correction-factor charts, Figs. 5-7, constructed in present works, in which neither eaC ,  
nor ebC ,  exists, and the calculation for mass-transfer rate is easy and direct.

operating with multipass flow, the hydraulic-dissipated energy due to the friction loss of fluid flow 
should be also discussed. The hydraulic-dissipated power in a parallel-plate channel may be 
estimated by   
H=( volumetric flow rate) P                                                  
If laminar flow in the flow channel is assumed, the pressure drop through the flow channel is [9]:

aq , bq  and N, while NE  increases rapidly with N. Nevertheless, the hydraulic-dissipated power 
still are too small to be concerned about.
