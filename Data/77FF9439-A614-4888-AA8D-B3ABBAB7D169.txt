態電阻與崩潰電壓間做取捨。為了解決此一
問題，許多新的製程技術已陸續被提出
(4)-(7)。然而，縱觀目前的文獻，大部分的解
決方法為更改製程參數或材料，如此將間接
改變其他步驟的製程參數導致複雜度增加。 
因此，本實驗室著手 RF LDMOS之技
術開發，僅利用佈局設計方法來實現同時具
有高崩潰電壓及低開啟態電阻的元件。我們
設計兩種不同佈局結構的 LDMOS(如圖一
所示)，其中 fishbone 結構為高頻功率元件
常用之結構，經過量測結果比較，發現我們
所新設計的 ring 結構可以大幅降低開啟態
電阻，並改善截止頻率與最大震盪頻率(8)。
本計畫除了最佳化 LDMOS佈局設計，以提
高元件的應用頻段之外，亦深入研究
LDMOS 的溫度效應與自我加熱效應
(self-heating effect)對元件特性的影響。

三、研究方法 
 
本計畫藉由設計不同的 LDMOS 元件
佈局，來開發適用於功率放大器的射頻
LDMOS技術，接著分析 LDMOS的各項微
波特性與熱特性。 
 
A. 元件佈局結構設計 
首先我們設計出一套具有不同閘極長
度、drift region長度、閘極指根數目與 cell
數目的 LDMOS元件之光罩，方便各項參數
之萃取與比較以及等效電路模型之建立，此
種多重 cell並聯的方式，可以提升速度和散
熱效率。同時將特殊結構之元件佈局加入，
例如：可將四邊形之 ring結構改為八邊形或
是圓形等，以研究不同的元件佈局結構對微
波特性之改善情形。另外，基於以 on-wafer 
probing 技術進行高頻測試之方便與準確
性，元件的 metal pad之設計規範尚需符合
微波量測探針之規格。此處我們還將加上各
種校準圖型，方便扣除 metal pad 所造成的
寄生電感與電容。除了元件之外，測試鍵
（Test key）的各項功能也是我們注意的重
點，除了可就各層光罩之間的對準情形進行
監控外，並賦予測量接觸電阻、閘極片電
阻、源/汲極片電阻、接面漏電、及閘極電
容的能力，以提高對製程監控的能力，並協
助等效電路模型參數的萃取。 
 
B. 微波特性測試與分析 
元件製作完成後，首先進行直流電性量
測，以提供元件特性評估及高頻量測之偏壓
條件參考，接著利用 on-wafer 高頻量測模
組來對元件進行各種偏壓條件下之高頻特
性量測。在此我們利用 IC-CAP軟體控制高
頻測試儀器進行元件的 S參數量測。在量測
之前，先運用 SOLT方法進行系統的校正，
然後進行 S-parameter 的量測。但此時所得
之結果仍包含metal pads所形成寄生元件的
效應，最後，還要利用已建立的 de-embedded
技術，將 metal pad的寄生元件效應除去，
即可求得 intrinsic device的 S-parameters，利
用測量出 S-parameters，即可描述元件的高
頻特性。根據量測結果，我們可以萃取各項
元件參數，以建立元件佈局參數與各項電性
參數之關係。 
元件的微波功率參數，如：輸入功率
(Pin)、輸出功率(Pout)、功率增益(G)、功率效
能 (η)、與三次諧波 (IM3)…等，由 LP1 
Load-Pull 功率測試系統量測。另外，由於
元件的非線性效應使其在高輸入功率時，輸
出功率無法再被線性地放大，而呈現壓縮現
象；當功率增益由小信號的線性增益下降
1dB時，定義為1dB壓縮點。我們萃取1dB壓
縮點之功率，來評估元件可操作的功率範

output resistance in the high-current region. It 
indicated the self-heating effect in the ring 
structure was significant due to the compact 
layout area. The device self-heating could be 
improved by increasing the distance between 
rings. 
The drain-source on-resistance is an 
important parameter for describing the 
performance of LDMOS transistors. The 
on-resistance (Ron) was extracted from the 
linear forward I–V characteristics at gate 
voltage VGS = 2 V, since it was predominated 
by the drift region under such a condition. The 
extracted Ron was plotted against the drift 
length in Fig. 4. As the drift length increased, 
the on-resistance increased in both structures 
due to a high drain parasitic resistance. In 
addition, Ron was lower in the ring structure 
than that in the fishbone structure and was 
interpreted as being due to a lower drain 
resistance.

B. 元件高頻特性 
The dependences of the cutoff frequency 
(fT) and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) 
on the drift length for the LDMOS with 
different layout structures are compared in Fig. 
5. The transistors were biased at VGS=2 V and 
VDS=28 V to obtain the maximum value of fT. 
It was observed that fT and fmax both 
decreasedwith increasing LDrift because the gm 
decreased and both Cin and drain resistance 
increased with increasing LDrift. In Fig. 5, we 
also found that fT and fmax for the ring structure 
had higher values than those for the fishbone 
structure. This might be attributed to the 
reduction of drain parasitic resistance. In 
addition, the difference in fmax between the 
fishbone and ring structures was larger than 
the difference in fT. 
By analyzing a MOSFET small-signal 
equivalent circuit, we can determine the effect 
of device parameters on high-frequency 
characteristics more clearly. Using extracted 
parameters from the existing device and 
altering one parameter at the time, the effect 
of model parameters on the cutoff frequency 
and maximum oscillation frequency can be 
visualized. The influences of model 
parameters on fT and fmax are shown in Fig. 6. 
The x-axis showed the parameter value 
departure from the initial value in percent. The 
y-axis showed the change in frequency in 
percent. Parameters not shown in the figure 
had approximately the same value for the ring 
and fishbone structures or had a minor 
influence on fT and fmax.

Figure 7 shows the extracted drain 
parasitic resistance versus the drift length for 
LDMOS transistors. As LDrift increased, the 
drain parasitic resistance increased. Note that 
for higher breakdown voltages, LDrift needed 
to be longer, resulting in poor on-resistance, fT, 
and fmax. Nevertheless, Ron and fmax for the 
ring structure appeared superior to those for 
the fishbone structure. The improvements of 
DC and RF characteristics were attributed to 
the minor drain resistance. The drain region of 
the ring structure had extra areas (the shaded 
regions) compared with the fishbone structure, 
and the extra areas would have lowered the 
drain parasitic resistance, as shown in the inset 
of Fig. 7. 
 
C. 元件功率特性 
Figure 8 shows the output power, power 
gain and power added efficiency (PAE) with 
different drift lengths. The input was 
terminated to 50 ohms and the load 
impedances were tuning for maximum output 
power. The devices were measured at 900 
MHz with gate bias VGS=2 V and drain bias 
VDS=28 V. In Fig. 8, the power characteristics 
were similar among these two transistors at 
low input power and showed discrepancy 
when input power was larger than 1-dB 
compression point (P1db). The main reason for 
gain compression was attributed to the 
clipping effect. As the drift length increased, 
larger on-resistance decreased the drain 
current which makes the negative duty cycle 
of output waveform enter the cutoff region 
earlier. This indicates that the average drain 
current started to increase earlier and the gain 
compression occurs prior. Consequently, the 
transistor with longer drift length showed 
lower P1db. 
Figure 9 shows the RF power 
characteristics for different layout structures. 
The ring structure exhibits a better 
performance than the fishbone.

In LDMOS, however, the effect of drain 
parasitic resistance was also important, which 
was ignored in eq. (2). Tasker and Hughes 
reported a more rigorous derivation for 
short-circuit current gain of a FET that takes 
source and drain resistance into account: (10) 
[ ]{ }2 ( ) 1 ( ) / ( )mT gs gd S d ds gd m S d
gf
C C R R R C g R Rπ= + ⋅ + + + ⋅ ⋅ +
                          (3) 
According to eq. (3), the sign of the term 
related to the gm in the denominator was 
positive, making the slope of the fT variation 
versus the intrinsic gm variation smaller than 1. 
In Fig. 13(a), the extrinsic fT included the 
effects of source and drain resistances and the 
values of the curve slope were smaller than 1. 
This might be attributed to the effect of 
(Rs+Rd) being more prominent than the effect 
of Rgs. Furthermore, the fishbone and ring 
structures we studied here had difference drain 
resistances, resulting in the distinct values of 
the curve slopes in Fig. 13(a). To eliminate the 
effect of parasitic resistance, the intrinsic fT 
was extrapolated after de-embedding the 
effect of the parasitic resistors from the 
measured S-parameters. As shown in Fig. 
13(b), the curve slopes of the intrinsic fT 
variation versus the intrinsic gm variation for 
the fishbone and ring structures are quite 
similar (0.95 for fishbone and 0.94 for ring) 
and approach 1. 
To study the self-heating effect on the 
performance of an LDMOS, we measured its 
I-V and RF characteristics under a pulsed 
condition. The quiescent biases for gate and 
drain were set to 0. The typical duration of the 
pulses was 5 µs with a period of 1 ms. These 
values allow the devices to cool sufficiently 
during the off time of the pulse period. The 
measured data was sampled for a short delay 
time (tp=1.5 µs) to eliminate the self-heating 
effect. Figure 14 shows typical output 
characteristics of an LDMOS under static- and 
pulsed-mode measurements. At low gate 
voltages (VGS<2 V), the measured static 
current of the LDMOS was similar to the 
pulsed current. However, the measured static 
current was lower than the pulsed current at 
high gate voltages due to higher thermal 
heating in the steady state. In an LDMOS, the 
channel temperature rises because of the 
power dissipation, and the carrier phonon 
scattering rate increases, which degrades the 
carrier mobility. At high gate biases, the 
self-heating effect was shown to be significant 
due to increased power dissipation.
