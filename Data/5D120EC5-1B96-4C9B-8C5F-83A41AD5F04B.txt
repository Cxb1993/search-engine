2.3 文獻探討 
In USA, Canada, and Japan, there is 
7-GHz-wide unlicensed band around 60 GHz 
for wireless personal area network (WPAN) 
system applications [1]. A 60 GHz WPAN 
system can provide short-range (<10 m) and 
high-speed (>2 Gb/s) multi-media data access 
to nearby consumer appliances and computer 
terminals. In the past, III-V semiconductor 
technologies were adopted in most of the 
applications for frequencies around 60 GHz 
and above. Recently, thanks to the rapid 
development of CMOS/BiCMOS processes, it 
has become possible to use them to implement 
60 GHz WPAN system and even 77 GHz radar 
system. 
In transceiver design, receiver front-end 
(which includes LNA [2]-[3] and mixer [4]-[5], 
etc.) is a critical block that receives small 
signals from antenna over the whole band of 
interest and amplifies and down-converts them 
with a good signal-to-noise ratio property. The 
basic requirements of a receiver front-end 
include good input impedance matching, good 
port-to-port isolation, low noise, and high gain 
over the whole band of interest. Recently, 
several excellent 60 GHz CMOS receivers 
front-end have been reported [6]-[7]. For 
example, in [6], a 60-65 GHz CMOS receiver 
front-end with 25-30 dB power gain in 0.13 μm 
CMOS process was demonstrated. However, its 
4 GHz 3-dB bandwidth (ω3dB) and 10-12 dB 
noise figure (NF) were not satisfactory. In [7], 
a 57-63 GHz CMOS receiver front-end in 0.13 
μm CMOS process was reported. However, its 
power gain of 11.8 dB and NF of 10.4 dB was 
not good enough. In this work, a 60 GHz 
CMOS receiver front-end with excellent 3-dB 
bandwidth (ω3dB) and noise figure properties 
using standard 0.13 μm CMOS technology is 
reported. The receiver front-end comprises a 
wideband low-noise amplifier (LNA), a 
current-reused bleeding mixer, a baseband (BB) 
amplifier, and a Wilkinson-power-divider- 
based 180o splitter. The receiver front-end 
consumed 50.2 mW and achieved high 
conversion gain of 18.7 dB, wide ω3dB of 9.8 
GHz, and low NF of 9 dB. Besides, excellent 
LO-RF, RF-IF, and LO-IF isolations were also 
achieved. 
 
2.4 研究方法 
The 60-GHz receiver front-end was 
designed and implemented by a standard 0.13 
μm CMOS process (on a p-type silicon 
substrate with thickness of 300 μm and 
resistivity of 8-12 Ω⋅cm) provided by a 
commercial foundry. This technology offers 8 
metal layers, named M1 to M8 from bottom to 
top. The thickness of M8 is 3.35 μm, and that of 
M7, M6-M2, and M1 is 0.83 μm, 0.37 μm, and 
0.26 μm, respectively. The IMD (inter-metal 
dielectric) thickness is 0.695 μm between M8 
and M7, 0.67 μm between M7 and M6, 0.45 μm 
between other adjacent metal layers, and 0.49 
μm between M1 and the silicon substrate. The 
interconnection lines as well as the microstrip- 
line (MSL) inductors are formed with the 3.35- 
μm-thick topmost metal to minimize the 
resistive loss. Fig. 1 shows the adopted receiver 
front-end architecture. Fig. 2 shows the 
schematic of the 60 GHz CMOS receiver front- 
end. The receiver front-end comprises a 
wideband LNA, a current-reused bleeding 
mixer, a baseband amplifier, and a 180o out-of- 
phase Wilkinson power divider. The design of 
the LNA, mixer, baseband amplifier, and 
divider are described in the following.

T-type input network. Besides, compared to the 
traditional single-balanced mixer topology, the 
bias current of the LO input transistors M7/M8 
is relatively smaller, so the voltage drop of the 
loads (R9 and R10) is smaller and hence M7/M8 
can be kept in the saturation region even for 
small supply voltage (Vd2 in Fig. 2) of 1 V. 
This in turn results in better linearity. Moreover, 
the baseband amplifier is used for single-end 
-to-differential conversion and providing 
additional gain. The NMOS transistors M10 and 
M11 form the input differential pair, while the 
PMOS current-mirror transistors M12 and M13 
provide the bias current for M10/M11 and act as 
the active load. 
 
2.4.3 180o 威爾金森功率等分器 
As shown in Fig. 2, the 180o out-of-phase 
Wilkinson power divider comprises a 
traditional Wilkinson power divider with two 
in-phase outputs, a right-hand π network (RHπ) 
at port-2 (i.e. port LOout+) for positive phase

shift, and a left-hand π network (LHπ) at port-3 
(i.e. port LOout-) for negative phase shift. The 
180o out-of-phase Wilkinson power divider 
can convert the single-ended LO input signal 
(LOin) into differential LO signals (LOout+ and 
LOout-) to provide the needed differential LO 
inputs of the mixer. 
Fig. 3(a) shows the simulated transmission 
gains S21 and S31 versus frequency 
characteristics of the 180o out-of-phase 
Wilkinson power divider. S21 and S31 is −5.05 
dB and −5.04 dB, respectively, at 59 GHz. In 
addition, the variation of S21 and S31 is only 
±0.13 dB and ±0.43 dB, respectively, for 
frequencies from 50 GHz to 64 GHz. It is 
interesting to note that S21 decreases with the 
increase of frequency, while S31 increases with 
the increase of frequency. This is reasonable 
since port-2 is close to short at very high 
frequencies due to the RHπ network, while 
port-3 loads a resistance close to maximum 
value of 50 Ω at very high frequencies due to 
the LHπ network.

physically impossible to be larger than 1. The 
reason why some of the “equivalent” magnetic 
coupling factor kIm in Fig. 6(b) are greater than 
1 is its definition.  
Fig. 6(c) shows the measured GAmax versus 
frequency characteristics of transformers TF-1 
and TF-2. High GAmax of 0.832, and 0.964 (i.e. 
NFmin of 0.799 dB, and 0.159 dB) are achieved 
at 60 and 80 GHz, respectively, for TF-1. In 
addition, high GAmax of 0.711, 0.925, and ~1 
(i.e. low NFmin of 1.481 dB, 0.339 dB and ~0 
dB) are achieved at 60, 80 and 100 GHz, 
respectively, for transformer TF-2. This means 
that simply by varying the metal width used 
from 10 μm to 5 μm, the operation 
frequency-band of the transformers can be 
varied from 48.1~84.4 GHz to 59.6~101.8 GHz 
if GAmax ≥ 0.7 is required.  
Fig. 6(d) shows the measured Q1 and GAmax 
versus frequency characteristics of transformer 
TF-1. A 242.8% (from 5.98 to 20.5) and a 
1004.9% (from 1.43 to 15.8) increase in 
Q-factor, a 7.3% (from 0.832 to 0.893) and a 
3.7% (from 0.964 to ~1) increase in GAmax, and 
a 0.308 dB (from 0.799 dB to 0.491 dB) and a 
0.159 dB (from 0.159 dB to ~0 dB) decrease in 
NFmin are achieved at 60 and 80 GHz, 
respectively, for TF-1 after the ICP etching. 
This means the backside ICP etching is 
effective to improve the Q-factor, GAmax, and 
NFmin performances of STIS transformers on 
normal silicon substrate.

a set of TL inductors (IND) with length of 200

parameters are labeled. The pad size is 
100×100 μm2, and the pad-to-pad spacing is 50 
μm. The width of TL-IND1, TL-IND2, and 
TL-IND3 is 20, 10, and 5 μm, respectively. The 
spacing between the ground (GND) lines 
(formed by M1) is fixed at 220 μm, so the 
spacing from TL-IND1, TL-IND2, and 
TL-IND3 to GND lines is 100, 105, and 107.5 
μm, respectively. A dummy open device, 
whose signal-pad spacing is 200 μm and 
GND-line spacing is 220 μm, is used for pad

the signal lines (TLs). Only M1, which is 
connected to the M6 pads through vias, is used 
as the GND lines encircling the TLs (see the

gain (S21) of STD TL-IND1, ICP TL-IND1,

(from 0.924 to 0.955) and a 1.8% (from 0.789 
to 0.803) increase in S21 was achieved at 30 
GHz and 60 GHz, respectively, for TL-IND1 
after the backside ICP etching. This is mainly 
attributed to the reduction of silicon substrate 
related losses, i.e. the reduction of Reff of the 
inductor. Besides, the phenomenon that the 
measured S21 of the ICP TL inductors increases 
with the increase of metal width can be 
explained by the reduction of both Leff and Reff 
mainly due to the reduction of Ls1 and Rs1.

NFmin versus frequency characteristics of STD 
TL-IND1, STD TL-IND3, ICP TL-IND1, and

the 48 GHz VCO by two twice. Recently, 
several CMOS VCOs with operation frequency 
around 48 GHz have been reported [14]-[18]. 
In [14], it has been demonstrated that a low- 
power of 1 mW can be achieved for a 51.6- 
GHz VCO. However, the corresponding phase 
noise of −85 dBc/Hz (at 1 MHz offset) is not 
low enough. On the other hand, it has been 
demonstrated that low-phase-noise of −99 
dBc/Hz (at 1 MHz offset) can be achieved for a 
50 GHz VCO [15]. However, the 
corresponding power dissipation of 13 mW is 
not satisfactory. To demonstrate that both low- 
power and low-phase-noise can be achieved for 
a CMOS VCO for 60-GHz radio, in this work, 
we present the design and implementation of a 
5.556 mW, 48-GHz VCO with excellent phase

LNA. Fig. 16(c) shows the backside chip 
micrograph of the LNA after the backside ICP 
dry etching (ICP LNA). As can be seen, the M1 
patterns of the ICP LNA are clearly visible. 
This means the silicon underneath the ICP 
LNA is indeed fully dry-etched away. 
On-wafer measurement was performed by 
an Agilent’s 67 GHz RFIC measurement 
system, including Agilent’s E8361A network 
analyzer, Agilent’s E8257D signal generator, 
and Agilent’s N8975A noise figure analyzer, 
etc.. The LNA is biased at Vdd1 = Vdd2 = Vdd3 = 
1.5 V, Vg1 = 0.72 V, and Vg2 = Vg3 = 0.75 V. 
The total drain current is 19.37 mA, that is, the 
LNA only consumes 29.1 mW power, a 
relatively low value for a CMOS LNA operated 
in the 60-GHz band.  
Fig. 17(a) shows the measured input-return- 
loss (S11) versus frequency characteristics of 
the STD LNA and the ICP LNA. The −10 dB 
input matching bandwidth of the ICP LNA is 
10.3 GHz (51.9~62.2 GHz), a little higher than 
that (10.1 GHz (52.2~62.3 GHz)) of the STD 
LNA. What is also shown in Fig. 3(a) is the

GHz (52.1~66.2 GHz)) of the STD LNA.  
Fig. 17(b) shows the measured forward 
gain (S21) versus frequency characteristics of 
the STD LNA and the ICP LNA. S21 of 12.2 dB 
is achieved for the ICP LNA at 60 GHz, 1.8 dB 
higher than that (10.4 dB) of the STD LNA at

This FOM includes the most relevant 
parameters for evaluating a UWB LNA for 
low-cost and low-power applications. Table II 
is a summary of the implemented STD LNA 
and ICP LNA in this work, and the recently 
reported state-of-the-art 60-GHz band CMOS 
LNAs. As can be seen, excellent input- 
impedance and output-impedance matching is 
achieved in this work. Besides, compared with 
other works, our ICP LNA exhibits the lowest 
NF and power consumption, and the highest 
FOM. The results indicate that the proposed 
LNA architecture in conjunction with the 
backside ICP deep-trench technology is very 
promising for high-performance 60-GHz-band 
RFIC applications.

The V-band sub-harmonic mixer was 
designed and implemented by a standard 0.13 
μm CMOS process provided by a commercial 
foundry. This technology offers 8 metal layers, 
named M1 to M8 from bottom to top. The 
interconnection lines as well as the microstrip- 
line (MSL) inductors are formed with the 3.35- 
μm-thick topmost metal to minimize the 
resistive loss. Fig. 20 shows the adopted sub- 
harmonic mixer architecture. Fig. 21 shows the 
schematic of the V-band CMOS sub-harmonic 
mixer, with the important device parameters 
labeled. The single-balanced sub-harmonic 
mixer comprises a current-reused bleeding 
mixer, a baseband amplifier, a 180o (Wilkinson

-power-divider-based) out-of-phase splitter, 
and a frequency doubler. The other component 
parameters adopted are as follows: The gate- 
length of transistors M1~M5 and M7~M10 is 
0.13 μm, and that of transistor M6 is 0.3 μm. 
The gate-width-per-finger of M1 to M10 is 5.3, 
5.3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 5, 5, 8 and 8 μm, respectively. 
The finger-number of transistors M1 to M10 is 
10, 6, 11, 15, 15, 6, 10, 10, 50 and 50, 
respectively. In the bias condition of Vd1 = Vd2 
= 1.5 V, Vg1 = 0.65 V, Vg2 = 1V, Vgp = 0.55V, 
VRF = 0.6V, and VLO = 0.35 V, the simulated 
power consumption of the sub-harmonic mixer 
is 31.25 mW. In addition, the simulated cut-off 
frequency (fT) and maximum oscillation 
frequency (fmax) of the RF-port input transistor 
M3 are 80.5 GHz and 109 GHz, respectively. 
The good fT and fmax performances indicate that

Fig. 26 Measured input third-order inter-modulation 
point (IIP3) at RF of 60 GHz of the V-band CMOS 
sub-harmonic mixer. 
 
 
bandwidth (ω3dB) of RF is 9.6 GHz (48.4 ~ 58 
GHz), a little lower than that (14.3 GHz, from 
48.6 to 62.9 GHz) of the simulation result. This 
is mainly because the LO-port matching 
frequency range shifts to lower frequencies, 
due to the inaccuracy of the spiral inductor 
model provided by the foundry. 
Fig. 24(a) shows the measured conversion 
gain versus RFin characteristics of the CMOS 
sub-harmonic mixer at RF of 60 GHz, LO of 
59.98 GHz and LOin of 8 dBm. As can be seen, 
at RFin of −20 dBm, the mixer achieves 
conversion gain of 4.3 dB. The corresponding 
P1dB is −8 dBm. Fig. 24(b) shows the measured 
conversion gain versus LOin characteristics of 
the CMOS sub-harmonic mixer at RF of 60 
GHz, RFin of −20 dBm, and LO of 59.98 GHz. 
For LOin smaller than 6 dBm, conversion gain 
increased linearly with the increase of LOin 
since the signal distortion is not significant. 
The conversion gain keeps roughly a constant 
(4 ~ 4.6 dBm) for LOin greater than or equal to 
7 dBm. Therefore, LOin of 8 dBm is used in 
this work, the corresponding conversion gain is 
4.3 dB. Fig. 24(c) shows the measured 
baseband output spectrum of the CMOS 
sub-harmonic mixer at RF of 60 GHz, RFin of 
−20 dBm, LO of 59.98 GHz, and LOin of 8 
dBm. As can been seen, the mixer achieves 
output power of −15.82 dBm at IF of 20 MHz. 
Fig. 25(a) shows the measured LO-to-RF 
and LO-to-IF isolation versus LOin 
characteristics of the CMOS sub-harmonic 
mixer at LO frequency of 29.99 GHz and RFin 
of −20 dBm. LO-to-RF and LO-to-IF isolation 
better than −51.8 dB and −50.9 dB, 
respectively, is achieved for LOin range of 0 ~ 
10 dBm. Fig. 25(b) shows the measured 
RF-to-IF isolation versus RFin characteristics of 
the CMOS sub-harmonic mixer at RF 
frequency of 60 GHz and LOin of 8 dBm. 
RF-to-IF isolation better than −32.5 dB is 
achieved for RFin range of −30 ~ −11 dBm. 
To characterize the non-linear behavior, 
two-tone signals with equal power levels and 
frequency difference of 1 MHz were applied to 
the mixer. Fig. 26 shows the measured 
fundamental and 3-order inter-modulation (IM3) 
output power versus input power characteristics 
of the mixer at IF frequency of 20 MHz and 
two-tone RF frequencies of 60 GHz and 60.001 
GHz. The measured input 3-order intercept 
point (IIP3) is 2 dBm.  
Table III is a summary of the implemented 
V-band CMOS sub-harmonic mixer, and the 
recently reported state-of-the-art CMOS mixers. 
As can be seen, the mixer achieves LO-to-RF 
isolation of −53 dB (at LO frequency of 29.99

return-loss smaller than −10 dB for frequencies 
from 27.2 GHz to 54.5 GHz.  
Fig. 28(b) shows the measured conversion 
gain and NF versus RF frequency 
characteristics of the receiver front-end at LO 
input power (LOin) of 2 dBm. At IF of 20 MHz, 
the receiver front-end achieves maximum 
conversion gain of 18 dB at 57 GHz. The 
corresponding ω3dB is 9.8 GHz, from 50.8 GHz 
to 60.6 GHz. Besides, at IF of 100 MHz, the 
measured minimum NF is 9 dB at 58 GHz, an 
excellent result for a 60-GHz-band CMOS 
receiver front-end. 
Fig. 29(a) shows the measured conversion 
gain versus RF input power (RFin) 
characteristics of the receiver front-end at LOin 
of 2 dBm. As can be seen, at RFin of −40 dBm, 
the receiver front-end achieves conversion gain 
of 18.5 dB and 16.5 dB, respectively, at RF 
frequency of 56 GHz and 60 GHz. The
