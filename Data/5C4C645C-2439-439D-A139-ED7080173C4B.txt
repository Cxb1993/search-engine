摘要 
本研究將針對非即時退化的物品，在供應商提供允許延遲付款優惠下，建立
一個適當的存貨模式，並找出使存貨相關總成本為最小的最適補貨策略。我們將
發展一些理論結果，且提出一個簡單容易使用的方法，以方便得到在不同情況下
的最適補貨週期。我們也將舉一些數值範例說明求解過程，並做敏感度分析。 
 
關鍵詞：存貨、非即時退化、允許延遲付款、財務

researchers assume that the deterioration of the items in inventory starts from the 
instant of their arrival in stock. In fact, most goods would have a span of maintaining 
quality or original condition, namely, during that period, there is no deterioration 
occurring. Wu et al. (2006) defined the phenomenon as “non-instantaneous 
deterioration”. In the real world, this type of phenomenon exists commonly such as 
firsthand vegetables and fruits have a short span of maintaining fresh quality, in which 
there is almost no spoilage. Afterward, some of the items will start to decay. For this 
kind of items, the assumption that the deterioration starts from the instant of arrival in 
stock may cause retailers to make inappropriate replenishment policies due to 
overvalue the total annual relevant inventory cost. Therefore, in the field of inventory 
management, it is necessary to consider the inventory problems for non-instantaneous 
deteriorating items. 
Furthermore, in deriving the traditional EOQ inventory model, it was tacitly 
assumed that the payment must be made to the supplier for the items immediately 
after receiving the consignment. However, in practice, for encouraging the retailer to 
buy more, the supplier allows a certain fixed period for settling the account and 
doesn’t charge any interest from the retailer on the amount owed during this period. 
Goyal (1985) first derived an EOQ model under the conditions of permissible delay in 
payments. It was assumed that the unit purchase cost is the same as the selling price 
per unit. Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) then extended Goyal’s (1985) model to consider 
the deteriorating items. Next, Jamal et al. (1997) generalized the model to allow for 
shortages. Recently, Teng (2002) amended Goyal’s (1985) model by considering the 
difference between unit price and unit cost, and found that it makes economic sense 
for a well-established buyer to order less quantity and take the benefits of permissible 
delay more frequently. There were several interesting and relevant papers related to 
the trade credits such as Davis and Gaither (1985), Shah (1993), Arcelus and 
 5
is, the longer the replenishment cycle time and the greater the order quantity will be. 
Finally, we provide several numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical results, 
and obtain some managerial phenomena. The outcome shows that the retailer can 
reduce total annual relevant inventory cost by ordering lower quantity when the 
supplier provides a permissible delay in payments, raising the length of time in which 
the product has no deterioration, or improving storage conditions for non- 
instantaneous deteriorating items.
