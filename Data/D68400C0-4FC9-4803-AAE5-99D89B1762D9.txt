Abstract
Vegetable oil methyl ester (VOME) is produced through the transesterification of vegetable
oil and can be used as biodiesel in diesel engines as a renewable, nontoxic, and potentially
environmentally friendly fossil fuel alternative in light of growing concerns regarding global
warming and increasing oil prices. This study used VOME fuel produced from eight different
oil bases to conduct a series of engine tests to investigate the effects of VOME on the engine
performance, exhaust emissions, and combustion characteristics at three different engine speeds
and at various gradational engine load conditions of a diesel engine. The experimental results
showed that using VOME in an unmodified direct injection (DI) diesel engine yielded a higher
brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) due to the VOME fuel’s lower calorific value. The
high cetane number of VOME also imparted a better ignition quality and the high intrinsic oxy-
gen content advanced the finish time of the heat release rate (HRR) during the ignition delay
period. The earlier start of combustion and the rapid combustion rate led to a drastic increase
in the HRR and the in-cylinder combustion pressure (ICCP) during the premixed combustion
phase. A greater extent of combustion resulted in higher peaks of HRR and ICCP as well as
near the top dead center (TDC) position. Thus, it was found that a diesel engine fueled with
VOME could potentially produce the same engine power as one fueled with petroleum diesel
(PD), but with a reduction in the exhaust gas temperature (EGT), smoke and total hydrocarbon
(THC) emissions, albeit with a slight increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. In addition,
VOME possesses shorter carbon chains, more saturated bonds, and a higher oxygen content
which also yields a lower EGT as well as reduced smoke, THC, and NOx emissions. However,
this is obtained at the detriment of an increased BSFC.

1. Introduction
Currently, the major source of energy
used across the globe is still obtained from
fossil fuels in the form of oil, coal, and natu-
ral gas. However, these fossil fuels are non-
renewable, disproportionately distributed in
certain regions of the world, and are likely
to be exhausted in the near future. In recent
years, the demands for energy have grown
very quickly due to the rapid development of
certain growing economies, especially in Asia
and the Middle East. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) has forewarned of an oil short-
age due to the imbalance between oil supply
and demand [1]. This supply deficit will have
serious implications for many non-oil produc-
ing countries which are dependent on oil im-
ports. Furthermore, the extensive use of fossil
fuels has increased the production of green-
house gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2),
thus exacerbating the greenhouse effect. In
- 1 -
as the heat release rate and the in-cylinder
combustion pressure were measured to gauge
the effects of VOME fuel on DI diesel engine
performance and exhaust emissions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Experimental apparatus
This study used a single cylinder, four-
stroke, water-cooled, direct injection diesel
engine (YANMAR TF110-F) to conduct a
series of engine tests. Table 2 shows the
engine specifications, whilst Fig. 1 shows
a schematic diagram of the engine set-up
and its instrumentation. The diesel en-
gine was coupled to a hydraulic dynamome-
ter, control equipment, and various measur-
ing instruments. The hydraulic dynamome-
ter (SCHENCK D230-1e) and a digital con-
troller (x-actD) were connected to the engine
to control the engine torque. A burette and
stopwatch were used to record the volume and
rate of fuel consumption for BSFC calcula-
tion. A three-way valve was used to introduce
the test fuel into the burette. For combustion
analysis, a quartz pressure transducer (AVL
QC43D) was mounted on the cylinder head
and a rotary encoder (BEI H25) was attached
directly to the crankshaft to measure the in-
cylinder combustion pressure and correspond-
ing crankshaft angles during the tests. These
two signals were delivered to the combustion
analyzer (AVL 620 Indiset) which was linked
to a personal computer running the IndiWin
2.0 software, plotting the heat release rate and
the in-cylinder combustion pressure. In addi-
tion, three thermocouples (INS S-512) were
installed on the exhaust gas outlet, and the in-
let and outlet of the water cooling system to
measure the engine exhaust gas temperature,
and the inlet and outlet cooling water tempera-
tures, respectively. Prior to the engine tests the
engine was warmed up after which the engine
temperature was maintained using a radiator.
Three sampling probes - a diesel smoke meter
(IYASAKA GSM-2) and two exhaust emis-
sion analyzers (HORIBA MEXA-1160CLT-
HA, and CAI Model 300 HFID); were inserted
into the exhaust gas tank to record the re-
spective smoke, NOx and THC emissions dur-
ing the tests. Furthermore, a pressure gauge,
humidity gauge, and dry and wet bulb ther-
mometers were utilized to record the atmo-
spheric pressure, relative humidity, and dry
and wet bulb temperatures. These variables
were used to calculate the correction factor
used in minimizing the background effects of
climate on each test. Finally, all experimental
data and related parameters were recorded in
a personal computer for data processing.
2.2 Test fuels
Soybean oil, peanut oil, corn oil, sun-
flower oil, rapeseed oil, palm oil, palm ker-
nel oil, and waste fried oil (vegetable oil ba-
sis) were used as raw materials to produce the
various VOME fuels used in the tests. The
vegetable oil and methanol were used as the
reactants in the transesterification reaction to
produce the VOME derivatives. In the pro-
cess of transesterification, sodium methoxide
(CH3NaO) was added as a catalyst to acceler-
ate the reaction rate. The PD used in the tests
was purchased from the Chinese Petroleum
Corporation in Taiwan and all VOME fuels
tested were supplied by Chant Oil Co., Ltd.,
Taiwan. In addition, the PD and each VOME
fuel tested were examined by Formosa Petro-
chemical Corporation, Taiwan, in accordance
with the standards of the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) for advanced
data analysis. The main physical and chemi-
cal fuel properties of all the test fuels are pre-
sented in Table 3. Furthermore, the fatty acid
compositions of all the VOME fuel samples
supplied by Chant Oil Co., Ltd., Taiwan, are
listed in Table 4.
2.3 Test procedures
PD and eight kinds of VOME (listed in
section 2.2) were used as test fuels in an un-
modified DI diesel engine with PD being first
- 3 -
caused by a peak in the in-cylinder combus-
tion pressure closer to the TDC position. As
shown in Fig. 3b, the maximum and minimum
differences in engine power at full load condi-
tions of three engine speeds between all the
VOME test fuels and the PD are just 1.41%
and -1.23%, respectively. This indicates that
using VOME yields the same engine power as
PD at full load conditions as well as at aver-
age load conditions for various engine speeds.
This is due to the higher BSFC, increased oxy-
gen content, and greater degree of combus-
tion.
3.2 Exhaust emissions
As described above, when fueled with
VOME, the diesel engine demonstrates better
combustion due to the uniform air-fuel mixing
and the extra oxygen available in the combus-
tion process. In addition, Table 3 shows that
all the VOME test fuels have less carbon con-
tent than that of PD. Therefore, when using
the VOME test fuels, a significant reduction in
the smoke emissions (ranging from decreases
of 49.96% to 72.7%) was observed when com-
pared to PD, as shown in Fig. 4. The fatty acid
composition of the VOME fuels also affects
the formation of exhaust emissions. As de-
scribed in the previous section, PKOME and
POME have shorter fatty acid carbon chain
lengths, thus improving the ignition quality.
Therefore, PKOME and POME are particu-
larly effective in reducing smoke emission (by
72.7% and 60.8%, respectively).
Fig. 5 shows that the use of VOME in
the diesel engine yielded higher NOx emis-
sions, ranging from an increase of 5.66% to
an increase of 26.06%, when compared to PD.
Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that whilst improved
combustion results in a significant reduction in
smoke emission, the higher combustion pres-
sure and temperature results in an increase of
NOx emission [9, 24, 43, 44]. These results il-
lustrate the tradeoff relationship between NOx
and smoke emissions for the various VOME
fuels [45-48]. However, PKOME and POME
are an exception in that they significantly re-
duce smoke emission, whilst only causing a
slight increase in NOx emission. The main
reason is that PKOME and POME have less
total heat release due to their lower energy
content when compared to the other VOME
test fuels. Therefore, a lower combustion tem-
perature in the combustion chamber results in
reduced formation of NOx emission. PKOME
and POME have shorter carbon chain lengths
whilst also having more saturated bonds. Fu-
els with more saturated bonds have superior
ignition quality [29, 48], allowing a lower
combustion temperature. Therefore, NOx for-
mation is reduced for PKOME and POME.
Conversely, SFOME, ROME, SOME, and
COME have higher volumetric calorific val-
ues, longer carbon chain lengths, and more un-
saturated bonds which require higher combus-
tion temperatures, yielding higher NOx emis-
sions than the other VOME fuels.
Fig. 6 shows that the VOME fuels re-
duced the THC emissions in the range of
22.5% to 32.71% due to the lower carbon
and hydrogen content relative to PD. In ad-
dition, the higher viscosity of VOME yields
stronger fuel spray penetration, as described
above. Superior air-fuel mixing and higher
oxygen content result in an improved combus-
tion process. Therefore, using VOME results
in a significant reduction in THC and smoke
emission. Again, the shorter carbon chain
lengths and higher oxygen content of PKOME
and POME results in a better combustion pro-
cess, further reducing the THC emission.
Fig. 7 shows that a VOME fueled diesel
engine has lower EGTs in the range of 0.52%
to 4.45% relative to PD. The lower energy
content of VOME results in a reduction in the
total heat release. Therefore, the combustion
temperature is reduced and a lower EGT is
observed [13, 28-30]. The lower volumetric
calorific value of PKOME and POME results
in lower total heat release. In addition, the
shorter carbon chain lengths of PKOME and
POME results in better ignition quality which
tends to reduce the combustion temperature.
Thus, lower EGTs are observed for PKOME
and POME.
- 5 -
lier starts of combustion, rapid rises of heat
release rate in the initial premixed combustion
phase, and higher peaks of heat release rate as
well as closer TDC position compared to PD
combustion due to superior ignition quality,
higher oxygen content, a better air-fuel mix-
ing, and improved combustion. All these re-
sults in a significant improvement in engine
power as well as a reduction in smoke and
THC emissions, as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and
6. In addition, the improved and faster com-
bustion of the VOME test fuels as a result
of the total fuel energy to be released during
the premixed combustion phase and mixing-
controlled combustion phase, also caused ear-
lier combustion finish, and lower values of
HRR during the late combustion phase, as
shown in Fig. 15. It was demonstrated that
combustion of the VOME test fuels yielded
lower EGTs, as shown in Fig. 7.
4. Conclusions
PD and eight kinds of VOME fuels were
used as test fuels in an unmodified DI diesel
engine to conduct a series of engine tests to
investigate the effects of VOME on the engine
performance, exhaust emissions, and combus-
tion characteristics in a diesel engine. A total
of twenty two operating conditions with vary-
ing engine speed and gradational load were
used to test each fuel.
Although the use of VOME fuel in a diesel
engine can achieve the same engine power
output as an engine run on PD, the lower volu-
metric calorific value of VOME fuels results in
an increase in the BSFC relative to PD. VOME
fuels have higher cetane number and thus can
provide better ignition quality. The higher vis-
cosity and higher oxygen content of VOME
fuels also yield better air-fuel mixing. Further-
more, increased oxygen available during com-
bustion improves the extent of combustion.
Therefore, it was found that the use of VOME
fuel in a diesel engine can reduce EGT whilst
also reducing smoke and THC emissions, al-
beit with a slight increase in NOx emission.
VOME fuels such as PKOME and POME,
which have shorter carbon chain lengths and
more saturated bonds, have superior ignition
quality. The superior ignition quality and the
higher oxygen content of these VOME fuels
tend to allow better combustion at a lower
temperature. Therefore, significant reductions
in EGT, smoke and THC emissions are ob-
served. A lower combustion temperature also
suppresses the formation of NOx emission.
However, a further increase in BSFC is ob-
served when compared to the other VOME fu-
els.
Certain combustion characteristics such
as the heat release rate and the in-cylinder
combustion pressure were also measured dur-
ing the tests. VOME fuels have better igni-
tion quality and higher oxygen content, result-
ing in earlier starts of combustion. Further-
more, the superior air-fuel mixing and higher
oxygen content available for combustion re-
sults in a rapid rise of the heat release rate and
the in-cylinder combustion pressure. There-
fore, higher peaks of heat release rate and
in-cylinder combustion pressures as well as
closer TDC positions are observed. For these
reasons, VOME fuels can potentially improve
the engine power whilst reducing the EGT, as
well as reducing smoke and THC emissions,
albeit at the detriment of a slight increase in
NOx emissions.
The experimental results demonstrated
that the physical and chemical fuel proper-
ties of VOME fuels have a significant ef-
fect on the combustion timing, combustion
rate, and combustion efficiency. These im-
pact on the engine performance, exhaust emis-
sions and combustion characteristics. Addi-
tionally, VOME fuels can be a good substitute
for a petroleum diesel engine due to its poten-
tial sustainability and environmental benefits
in the form of reduced emissions.
