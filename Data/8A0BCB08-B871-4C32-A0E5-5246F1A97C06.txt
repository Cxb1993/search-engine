of organic contamination with different forms of 
carbohydrates. The presently determined Kch values of 
13 PAHs are substantially lower than the literature 
data； the latter are highly suspect as they were 
obtained with (i) presumably impure carbohydrate 
samples or (ii) indirectly measured equilibrium 
solute concentrations in carbohydrate and water 
phases. Estimated partition coefficients for 
compounds with the amorphous starch (Kstarch) via 
SPARC from other study are considerably higher than 
our experimental Kch values. However, that the SPARC-
estimated Kstarch of compounds with the amorphous 
starch are essentially the same in magnitude as the 
respective partition coefficients with the amorphous 
soil organic matter (Kom). The soil organic matter is 
known to be much less polar than the carbohydrate 
and, as expected, the Kom values for the low-polarity 
compounds are considerably higher than the respective 
Kch values with strongly hydrophilic carbohydrates. 
With the close relationship of the solute partition 
coefficient with the solvent polarity, this view is 
in keeping with the observed close similarity of the 
measured Kch values with both cellulose and starch 
samples used in this study. 
Although the Kch values are generally considerably 
lower than the respective Kow (octanol-water) or 
Klipid (lipid-water), accurate Kch data are duly 
required to accurately estimate the contamination of 
carbohydrates by organic compounds because of the 
abundance of carbohydrates over lipids in crops and 
plants. To overcome the current lack of reliable Kch 
data for organic compounds, a close correlation of 
log Kch with log Kow has been established for 
predicting the unavailable Kch data for low-polarity 
compounds.

Abstract 
In view of the current lack of reliable 
partition coefficients for organic compounds 
with carbohydrates (Kch), carefully 
measured values with cellulose and starch, 
the two major forms of carbohydrates, are 
provided for a wide range of compounds: 
short-chain chlorinated hydrocarbons, 
halogenated benzenes, alkyl benzenes, 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
polychlorinated biphenyls, and 
organochlorine pesticides. To ensure the 
accuracy of the Kch data, solute 
concentrations in both water and 
carbohydrate phases are measured by direct 
extraction of the samples. For a given 
compound, the observed partition coefficient 
with cellulose (Kcl) is virtually the same as 
that with starch (Kst). This finding expedites 
the evaluation of organic contamination with 
different forms of carbohydrates. The 
presently determined Kch values of 13 PAHs 
are substantially lower (by 3-66 times) than 
the literature data; the latter are highly 
suspect as they were obtained with (i) 
presumably impure carbohydrate samples or 
(ii) indirectly measured equilibrium solute 
concentrations in carbohydrate and water 
phases. Estimated partition coefficients for 
compounds with the amorphous starch 
(Kstarch) via SPARC from other study are 
considerably higher than our experimental 
Kch values and that the estimated Kstarch 
could be made to fall close to the 
experimental Kch for most (but not all) 
compounds by lowering the former by 1.38

據的有機物而言，通常藉由已知的辛醇-
水 分 配 係 數 (octanol-water partition

數據。然而，實驗數據不一致的 Kcl 值會
導致化合物的 Kcl 與 Kow 相關性混亂，而
無法從現有已知的 Kow 數據去預測未知有

實驗所量測的 PAHs 的 Kcl 值均低於各自
的 Kow值約 400 倍，而根據 Zhang and Zhu 
(2009)的報告則顯示，有機物的 Kch 的數值
僅比該化合物的 Kow值低 26-41 倍。如此
不一致的 Kch 測量值，會導致不相同的 Kch
和 Kow迴歸式，使得有機化合物分配在碳
水化合物的預測結果產生很大的差異。因
此，有必要針對不同有機物，進行精確的
Kch 數據量測，以修正目前文獻上所看到
的數據不確定性與不一致性狀況。 
由於有機物的 Kch 值非常小，精準地
地測定有機化合物的 Kch 值必須非常小，
以確保測量數值的可靠性。鑑於缺乏有機
污染物對糧食作物或一般碳水化合物一

包 括 halogenated benzenes 、 alkyl 
benzenes、aniline derivatives、short-chain

polychlorinated biphenyls、organochlorine 
pesticides 及 phthalate esters 等。除了比較
量測 Kch 的一致性，本研究亦探討澱粉(Kst)
與纖維素(Kcl)的 Kch 值是否有顯著差異。
澱粉和纖維素具有相同的分子組成
(C6H10O5)n，但是澱粉中的葡萄糖單位分子

2.1 分配理論 
考慮溶質在兩個部分相溶的溶劑系
統（以辛醇水系統為例），溶質在辛醇和
水溶劑之間達到平衡的條件是溶質在兩
相的活性（activity）必須相同。溶質在辛
醇-水系統的分配係數可定義為： 
 Kow = oC / wC  
其中 oC 和 wC 分別是溶質在水飽和之辛醇
相和辛醇飽和之水相的莫耳濃度。如果系
統的溶質莫耳數遠低於溶劑的莫耳數，方
程式(1)可轉換為 (Chiou et al., 1982)： 
log Kow =  log Sw  log oV   log o  
log( w / *w ) 
其中Sw是液體或 supercooled liquid的莫耳
水溶解度。 o 項代表溶質和水飽和之辛醇
的相容程度； w / *w 則是修正辛醇水系統
中，溶解到水相的辛醇所造成的溶質水溶

就是以溶質在兩相的活性皆是以莫耳濃
度為基準來表示，並沒有考慮到溶質和溶
劑之間的分子大小效應  (molecular-size 
disparity)。 
當考量溶質分配到 macromolecular 
solvent phase，溶質和溶劑的莫耳體積差距
太大時，上述以 Raoult’s law 為表示的方
程式會造成溶質莫耳分率和溶質溶解度
的低估。藉由 FloryHuggins theory 可以合
理地描述溶質在 macromolecular solvent 
phase 的化學活性(chemical activity, a)，如
下所示： 
ln a = ln   (1V / pV ) p  p2 
其中和p 分別是溶質和溶劑的體積分
率；V 和 pV 是溶質和溶劑的莫耳體積；
是 FloryHuggins 的作用常數。當兩相系
統中的溶質是低濃度時，Chiou (1985)提出
以Flory-Huggins theory為基礎的溶質在兩
相之分配係數和水溶解度關係： 
log K =  log SwV   [(1V / pV ) ]/2.303 
 log( w / *w ) (4)

的化合物的 log Kow和其水溶解度(log Sw)
負相關關係(Chiou et al., 2005; Chiou et al, 
1982)，也會存在於非極性溶質的 log Kch
和 log Sw。除了 ANDVs 化合物外，迴歸
表 1 至表 3 非極性化合物的 log Kch 和 log

 log Kch = – 0.595 log Sw – 1.21

中 Sw(mol/L)濃度範圍跨 5.4 個數量級；而
Kch (L/kg)範圍跨 3.2 個數量級。由於溶質

benzene(0.56)和 CT(1.75)在纖維素的 Kch 
(Rutherford et al., 1992)與本實驗測得數據
0.60 和 1.70 具有很好的一致性。考慮到包

資料的一致性和使用審慎測量 Kch 的方法
能夠說明所獲得 Kch 資料具有極大的可信
性。 
表 3 的資料顯示，PAHs 之 Kch 文獻值
(Zhang and Zhu, 2009; Jonker, 2008)均高於
本實驗的 Kch 值 3 至 66 倍。考慮到非極性
溶質(例如 PAHs)和極性碳水化合物的極
性差異(Rutherford et al., 1992)，文獻中如
此高的 Kch 值是值得懷疑的。根據相對較
高的五種 PAHs 之 Kch 值研究，Zhang and 
Zhu (2009)認為植物(ryegrass roots)的碳水
化合物比脂質吸收更多的 PAHs，因為一
般作物和植物的碳水化合物含量高於脂
質。由於研究所獲得的 Kch 值明顯低於
Zhang and Zhu (2009)報導值 12 至 66 倍。
從 Zhang and Zhu (2009)測量 Kch 的實驗步
驟，我們推測他們由 ryegrass roots 萃取的
碳水化合物(纖維素)樣品不夠純淨；或樣
品對水之比例(1:400 至 1:2000)太少，溶質
液相濃度減少不夠顯著，導致無法準確量
測溶質的濃度減少量。樣品純度和樣品對
水比例對溶質濃度減少的影響可以用
phenanthrene (PHN)作為代表性溶質、碳水
化合物對水的比例=1:2000(如用於 PHN)
和 Kch (PHN) = 25 作說明。相對於沒添加
碳水化合物的對照組，經由質量平衡計
算，上述比例添加碳水化合物之水中 PHN
於平衡後只有減少 1.25％。因此，如果
Zhang and Zhu (2009)使用的碳水化合物
樣本為高純度，PHN 在水中濃度的減少將
太小而無法準確量化，造成更大的分析誤
差。 
Jonker (2008)測量同樣的 PAHs 對纖
維素之 Kcl 值，其分配係數遠低於 Zhang 
and Zhu (2009) (例如 PHN低 6.5倍，pyrene
低 21 倍)，但 Jonker (2008)的實驗數據仍
然高於本研究獲得之 Kch(高 3-15 倍)。
Jonker (2008)使用的纖維素為造紙工廠提
煉自橡木之無氯樣品，並以正己烷萃取純
化去除污染物。這些樣品可能含有殘留木
質素(比纖維素更低極性的物質)而影響化
合物的分配作用。研究所獲得的 Kch 是使
用高純度澱粉與纖維素且對於固相與液

為解釋研究)所報導PAHs對碳水化合
物的分配係數和文獻的明顯差異，Hale et 
al. (4) 認為其中一個可能的原因是由於使

較為適當的水合樣本(hydrated samples)進

值明顯地比本研究高。Hale et al.認為修正
纖維素的結晶效應後，也就是 SPARC 預
測 Kstarch 的數值降低 1.38 log units(大約 24
倍)時，大部分實驗的 Kch 會和預測值接
近。然而，SPARC 估算 Kstarch 的數值和非
定形土壤有機質(soil organic matter)的分
配係數(Kom)落在同一個數量級(Chiou et 
al., 1983)。相對高極性的碳水化合物(纖維

也就是低極性化合物的 Kom數值明顯地會
比Kch高。 由於溶質的分配係數和溶劑(或
介質)極性具有密切關係存在，碳水化合物
結晶對分配係數的差異應該不會有強烈
的影響。藉由多醣 (polysaccharide)在水中

最後，相對於低極性化合物的 Kch 和

Abstract 
The sorption of phenanthrene (PHN) to relatively pure soil humic acids (HAs) was 
investigated to assess the suitability of the soil HA as a surrogate sorbent for the soil organic 
matter (SOM). The HAs were prepared in both freeze-dried and air-dried forms. The two 
forms of HAs from the same source are similar in composition but the freeze-dried HAs 
exhibit a significantly higher initial surface area (SA) (3.86-4.59 m2/g); the SAs of air-dried 
HAs are below 0.1 m2/g. However, the SAs of freeze-dried HAs are not stable upon contact 
with water; the samples lose practically all the SA after 4 days of immersion in water. The 
PHN sorption to both forms of HAs is practically linear, whether a co-solute is present or not. 
The sorption linearity observed with the present freeze-dried HAs is in sharp contrast with the 
allegedly nonlinear PHN sorption on similar freeze-dried HAs as presented by others. 
 
Capsule: 
This study shows no alleged nonlinear sorption of a nonpolar organic pollutant from water to 
solid humic acids extracted from soils 
 
Keywords: 
Soil organic matter; Soil humic acid; Freeze-drying; Sorption linearity; Phenanthrene

whether the observed nonlinear sorption with a freeze-dried HA stems from unique HA 
surface properties is important because it affects the estimation of contaminant sorption by a 
soil by using the isolated HA as a surrogate for SOM. 
 In light that the freeze-drying of a dissolved or suspended substance could significantly 
increase the specific surface area of the solid sample, the noted sorption nonlinearity with a 
freeze-dried HA might well result from its increased surface area. Since freeze-drying is not a 
natural process, it is vital to verify if a significantly greater SA occurs to a freeze-dried HA 
that leads to a nonlinear solute uptake. With this in mind, this study compares the measured 
BET surface areas of several freeze-dried and air-dried HAs and the associated sorption 
isotherms of a model organic solute (PHN) with these HAs. The influences of a co-solute on 
the linearity and magnitude of the nominal solute sorption with both HA samples are also 
investigated to supplement the account of the contaminant sorption behavior. 
 
2. Experimental Section 
2.1. Materials 
The organic compounds used as solutes in this study, i.e., naphthalene (NAP) (99%+ in 
purity) and phenanthrene (PHN) (98%), were all purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and 
used without further purification. Two types of sorbents were employed for solute sorption: 
whole peat soils (from Florida, USA and Nantou, Taiwan) and their isolated humic acids 
(HAs). The Florida peat (short as the FL peat) is a reference sample of the International 
Humic Substances Society (IHSS), collected from Everglades, Florida, USA. The Nantou peat 
(short as the NT peat) is a woody peat obtained from Puli, Nantou, Taiwan. Samples of the 
peats were ground to pass a 35-mesh sieve, mixed and oven-dried overnight at 90C prior to 
the sorption experiment. Relatively pure HAs were extracted from these soils. The BET 
surface areas (SA) of studied sorbents were measured using the N2 adsorption data achieved 
 21
freeze-dried HA was obtained by freeze-drying the solution in a freeze drier (Ilshin Lab Co., 
Ltd., Korea). The air-dried or freeze-dried HA samples prepared from replicate experiments 
were uniformly mixed. 
 
2.3. Sorption experiments 
Procedures for the sorption of single solutes have been described elsewhere (Chiou et al., 
1983). A total of 0.02–0.2 g of peat soil or HA was added to 30 mL screw-capped centrifuge 
tubes with 0.05 M CaCl2 water solution to which different amounts of a test solute were added. 
The solid-water ratio was adjusted so that the concentration in water showed a 30-70% 
reduction after equilibrium. The initial PHN concentrations were in the range of 0.077 to 
0.774 mg/L (i.e., 6 to 60% of the PHN water solubility). No adjustment of pH was made for 
the solute sorption by whole peats; the water solution pH stayed around 5.3–6.3 in the 
experiments. With the isolated HAs as sorbents, the water solution pH was controlled at 2.0 
by adding 0.1 M HCl. The target solute in methanol was added to the peat-water or HA-water 
mixture, with the added methanol being less than 0.2% (v/v) in solution. 
 Procedures for the binary-solute sorption experiment were the same as described except 
that a co-solute was added to the system. In this study, naphthalene (NAP) was used as the 
co-solute with an initial concentration of 6.3 mg/L (i.e., about 20% of the NAP solubility in 
water). As a co-solute, the NAP concentration was kept constant when the target solute 
concentration varied. All samples were equilibrated for 3–4 days on a rotary mixer at 
temperature of 251C. Preliminary tests indicated that the solute sorption reached 
equilibrium within 3 days. After equilibrium, the solid and solution phases were separated by 
centrifugation at 2460 g (3500 rpm) for 1 hour. The solute in water was extracted by hexane 
and analyzed using a Varian 4000 GC/MS system comprised of a CP3800 GC and a 4000 
 23
analysis (Karapanagioti et al., 2001), which exceeds the concurrent solute partition into the 
peat humic matter. At higher concentrations, the solute adsorption approaches saturation 
quickly with increasing concentration while the partition increases linearly, such that the 
isotherm becomes virtually linear. 
It is noted that the NT peat exhibits a lower nonlinear sorption than the FL peat for PHN 
from water while the former peat has a much higher SA (4.28 m2/g) than the latter peat (1.26 
m2/g). This suggests that the large SA of the NT peat comes mainly from its mineral surfaces 
(see Table 1), which are ineffective to the organic solutes when saturated by water. Here the 
nonlinear sorption capacities of PHN with FL and NT peats, obtained by extrapolating the 
upper linear isotherm to the ordinate axis, are about 200 and 90 mg/kg, respectively. Since the 
nonlinear uptake of a nonpolar solute by the FL peat is known to result essentially from 
adsorption on charcoal-like substances in the peat, the above data suggest that there is a less 
PHN uptake by the charcoal-like substances in NT peat than in FL peat. In present HA 
samples, the charcoal-like substances should have been mostly removed after a series of 
dissolution-precipitation steps applied to the HA isolation and purification (Chiou et al., 2000). 
It has also been demonstrated that the nonlinear uptake of a nonpolar solute by a soil is 
sharply attenuated by other co-existing solutes as a result of adsorptive competition (Chiou et 
al., 2000), with the net sorption of a solute being mediated primarily by noncompetitive 
partition into SOM to give a relatively linear isotherm. The latter effect is consistent with the 
result in Figure 1 that the slopes of the upper linear PHN sorption to both peats when 
normalized to respective SOM contents (ca. 83% and 63% for FL and NT peats, respectively) 
are fairly comparable because of the predominant PHN partition into SOM and comparable 
SOM compositions between soils (Kile et al., 1995). 
 We now consider the SAs of the isolated HAs. As indicated, the SAs of all air-dried HAs 
are below detection (i.e., <0.1 m2/g). This suggests that the air-dried HAs contain insignificant 
 25
Kile, 1998). Moreover, the similar PHN linear sorption coefficients with both air-dried and 
freeze-dried HAs from the same source are in accord with their comparable elemental 
compositions shown in Table 1. The noted sorption coefficient of PHN with a HA (air-dried or 
freeze-dried) is about the same as that of the corresponding SOM-normalized linear PHN 
sorption by the peat (see Table 3). Thus, the extracted HA appears to serve as a reasonable 
model for SOM on estimating the contaminant sorption coefficient. 
In addition to the single-PHN sorption to various HAs, the sorption data of PHN as the 
target solute with NAP as a co-solute are also listed in Table 2 for comparison. With either the 
freeze-dried or the air-dried HAs, the PHN isotherms are all essentially linear (n = 1.00) in all 
binary-solute systems. As the sorption capacities of PHN in binary-solute systems are largely 
the same as those in single-solute systems (i.e., no significant solute competition) and all 
isotherms are virtually linear, the results are indicative of the solute uptake by a partition 
process. Whereas the high sorption linearity of PHN with the air-dried HAs that exhibit 
insignificant SAs is well anticipated on this basis, the observed high sorption linearity with 
the freeze-dried HAs is not anticipated a priori on the basis of their measured SAs prior to the 
sorption experiments. The latter system will be further elaborated. 
The present finding with the freeze-dried HAs is in sharp contrast with the allegedly 
nonlinear sorption of nonpolar solutes (e.g., PHN and pyrene) on a series of freeze-dried HA 
samples reported by Pignatello et al. (2006a). These authors argued that the SOM or the 
isolated solid HA consists of both a glassy and a rubbery domains, where the glassy domain 
acts as an adsorbent and the rubbery domain as a partition phase, and thus the uptake by a HA 
sample free of high-surface-area charcoal-like materials and/or black carbon (BC) may 
produce a sorption nonlinearity. A major problem with the glass-rubbery model is the lack of 
evidence for a large, N2-accessible SA that is needed to accommodate the assumed adsorbed 
solutes on the glassy SOM or HA (Chiou and Kile, 1998; Chiou et al., 2000). 
 27
the SA of a freeze-dried amorphous Al-oxide (Goldberg et al., 2001), due likely to a similar 
attack of moisture on the reactive surface sites of the oxide. 
In light of the observed linear PHN sorption effects with both air-dried and freeze-dried 
HAs that are supported by the observed SAs and the influence of water on the measured SAs, 
we are puzzled by the alleged sorption nonlinearity of PHN and other nonpolar solutes with 
many freeze-dried HAs as reported by others. It would seem that if a nonlinear effect is to 
exist in the solute sorption to a freeze-dried HA, the SA of the HA sample should not only be 
significantly large but also be stable against water. Unfortunately, with little information 
provided by these authors on the SAs, compositions, and stabilities of the freeze-dried HAs, 
no definitive view could be reached on the general validity of the alleged nonlinear uptake of 
nonpolar contaminants by the isolated, freeze-dried HAs. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, solid humic-acid sorbents (HAs) were isolated from two soils (FL and NT 
peats) in either the air-dried or the freeze-dried form for investigation as surrogates for the 
SOM in contaminant sorption. Whereas the elemental compositions for the air-dried and 
freeze-dried HAs derived from the same source are practically the same, the measured SAs of 
the freeze-dried samples (3.86-4.59 m2/g) are significantly higher than for the air-dried 
samples. The present study shows however that the sorption isotherms of a contaminant (PHN) 
onto the isolated HAs derived from all sources are practically linear over a wide range of 
relative solute concentrations, much independent of whether the HA is obtained in an air-dried 
or freeze-dried form. The observed PHN sorption coefficients with HAs are comparable to 
those with the SOM. The present finding on the linear PHN sorption to a freeze-dried HA is 
contrary to the reports by others that the sorption of nonpolar solutes with a freeze-dried HA 
displays a significant nonlinearity. The high isotherm linearity and no competitive effect as

Abstract   
Whereas Raoult’s law is commonly used to estimate the activities of solutes and solvents of 
comparable molecular sizes and the Flory-Huggins (F-H) model for small liquids in high 
polymers, there has been no confirmed choice of a solution model when the solute and solvent 
differ only moderately in size (e.g., by 4-10 times); examples of the latter are the solutions of 
numerous organic compounds in liquid triolein (MW = 885.4) and poly(propylene glycol) 
(PPG) (MW = ~1000). The observed near-athermal solubilities of many nonpolar organic 
solids in these solvents provide unique experimental data to critically test the merits of 
various solution models. As illustrated, Raoult’s law underestimates widely, while the F-H 
model underestimates slightly, the solid solubilities with both triolein and PPG because of the 
underestimation of the entropy of solution. To solve the problem, it is assumed that the 
segments (or fragments) of a large-sized liquid solvent (e.g., triolein) act as independent 
mixing units to raise the entropy of solution. This postulate leads to a modified F-H model, in 
which a solid’s “ideal” or “athermal” solubility in volume fraction at a temperature is 
numerically equal to the solid’s activity at that temperature. Results from other studies show 
further supports for a volume-fraction-based solution model over Raoult’s law to interpret the 
solubility and partition data of compounds with many organic phases. 
 
 41
the situation has not been resolved for systems where the solute and solvent differ only 
moderately in molecular size, as compared to typical polymer-liquid systems. A good example 
of such a system is the solution formed by an organic compound with lipid triolein, the latter 
being a liquid at room temperature with a molar volume (0.976 L/mol) about 4-10 times those 
of most organic compounds.8 In this case, whereas the F-H model accounts far more closely 
than Raoult’s law for the solubility of nonpolar solids in triolein 8, the observed solubilities of 
some solids (e.g., naphthalene) fall very close to or even slightly above the athermal 
(solubility) limits of the F-H model. This suggests that the activity of an organic solute in 
triolein estimated with the F-H model is only approximately accurate despite its superiority 
over Raoult’s law to reconcile the solubility data.   
Up to now, no other model has been ratified to account satisfactorily for the solute 
solubility in triolein or other large-molecular liquids. Resolution of this issue is important 
because accurate predictions of the solubilities or partition coefficients of organic 
contaminants with many organic phases depend critically on properly defined contaminant 
activity coefficients and related parameters.9 An analysis on the model applicability involving 
a significant solute-solvent size disparity was given earlier by Shinoda and Hildebrand10,11 
utilizing the solubility data of iodine (solute) in solvents of varying molecular sizes. In that 
study, the authors asserted that the entropies of solution of iodine with relatively nonpolar 
quasi-spherical solvents follow closely the ideal-solution law (i.e., Raoult’s law), much 
independent of the solvent-solute size ratio.  
With above contrasting findings, this study examines an extensive set of the solubility 
data with the aim of finding an effective solution model for the stated size-disparate solution 
system. The solubilities of a wide variety of organic solids at room temperature in two liquid 
solvents of large molecular sizes, triolein and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG), have been 
carefully measured to augment the analysis of the model applicability.   
 43
a mass or molar unit must decrease with increasing molecular weight (or molar volume) of 
the solvent, if the model is to hold.  
In systems where the solvent is an amorphous polymer, the athermal solubility of a solid 
compound, expressed as the volume fraction of the dissolved solid in solution ( oat ), may be 
similarly derived by equating the solute activity in a polymer solution2,4 with that of the pure 
solid 8 to give    
                              ln oat + φp[1 – (V / pV )]  + χs φp2 = – (Δ fH /R) [(Tm – 
T)/TTm]             (2) 
where V  (L/mol) is the molar volume of the small-sized solute and pV  (L/mol) is the 
molar volume of the polymer, φp (= 1- oat ) is the volume fraction of the polymer, and χs is an 
empirical parameter correcting for the excess entropic reduction in a solute-polymer solution 
due to a specific nonlinear polymer structure. For a highly flexible linear polymer, χs = 0. 
Again, if the solution of a solid in a polymer is less than “perfect”, called “athermal” in this 
case, the deviation may also be conveniently quantified by an activity coefficient (γfh), i.e., γfh 
= oat / oob , where oob  is the observed solute volume-fraction solubility. As noted with eq 2, 
if the molar volume of a relatively linear (amorphous) polymer is very large, i.e., V / pV ≈ 0, 
the oat  value of a solid compound at a temperature in any linear polymer is largely 
independent of the molecular sizes of the solid (solute) and polymer.   
For a small-molecular solute in solution with an amorphous polymer or a macromolecular 
solvent, Raoult’s law (eq 1) predicts a sharply higher solute activity than the F-H model (eq 2). 
Therefore, the ideal solubility of a small-sized solid compound by Raoult’s law is sharply 
lower than the corresponding athermal solubility by the F-H model. In this study, we 
compared first the efficiencies of eq 1 and eq 2 to accommodate the observed solubilities of 
solid organic compounds in both (liquid) triolein and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG). An

Solubility Measurements. The solubilities of selected organic solids in triolein and PPG 
were measured in an air-conditioned room maintained at 261C. To determine the solubility, 
an excess amount of a test solid (solute) was added to 0.501.0 mL of the solvent in a 2.0-mL 
glass vial to saturate the solute in solution. Samples were prepared in triplicate for each test 
solid and equilibrated for 34 days on a rotary mixer. After the solution appeared to have 
reached the point of saturation, i.e., when an excess solid phase was visible after the 
equilibration, the solid and solution phases were separated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm 
(2460 g) for 2 minutes. To obtain the solid solubility at a constant temperature, the 
equilibrated sample was kept in the temperature-controlled room overnight. An aliquot of the 
supernatant was then withdrawn and diluted with hexane for subsequent analyses of the solute 
concentration by a gas chromatograph (GC) from the Thermo Finnigan Trace GC System 
(Thermo Electron Corp., Italy) equipped with a flame ionization detector. A DB-5MS 
capillary column (30 m long x 0.25 mm inner diameter with a 0.25 m film thickness) from 
Agilent Technologies, Inc. was used for the solute separation.  The GC carrier gas used was 
high-purity helium (Jing-Shang Corp., Kaohsiung, Taiwan) maintained at a constant flow rate 
of 1 mL/min.  
 
Data Manipulation and Handling. For all solid solutes, the measured solubility values and 
their standard deviations, in grams of the solid per 100 grams of the solvent, from triplicate 
samples were averaged and reported. The observed solid solubilities in triolein (Sgt) and PPG 
(Sppg) were converted to respective solute mole fractions ( oobx ) and volume fractions (
o
ob ) 
using the moles of solutes dissolved and the molar volumes (V ) of solutes and solvents. The 
molar volume of a dissolved solid (solute) used in this conversion is that based on the 
estimated liquid-solute density, which is assumed to equal the solid-solute density if the solid 
 47
Sppg are moderately greater than the respective Sgt; for the two more polar solids (carbaryl and 
aldicarb), the Sppg values are sharply higher than the respective Sgt values. The observed solid 
solubilities are intrinsically consistent with the polarities of triolein and PPG as the solvents.  
We examine next the measured mole-fraction solubilites ( oobx ) in both triolein and PPG 
and the respective Raoult’s ideal solubilities ( oidx = a
s) of the studied solids, as listed in Tables 
1-3. The data show clearly that, even with the triolein-solute (or PPG-solute) size disparity as 
small as about 4:1, as with p,p’-DDT, the observed oobx  values of all nonpolar solids exceed 
unequivocally the ideal-solubility limits, oidx ; i.e., the solutions show negative deviations 
from Raoult’s law. Thus, the activity coefficients by Raoult’s law, i.e., γmf = oidx  / oobx , 
become less than 1, ranging between 0.47 and 0.70, for the nonpolar solutes. In principle, the 
fractional solute activity coefficients are physically justifiable only for rare cases where the 
solute and solvent are associated to each other via specific molecular forces.  Since there are 
no active polar or ionic groups in these solutes and solvents (triolein and PPG) to promote 
specific interactions, the results manifest merely the failure of Raoult’s law to account for the 
solute activities or solid solubilities because of the solute-solvent size disparity, even though 
the size disparity in this case is only moderate.  
As seen, the observed solubility data of weakly polar (dibenzothiophene and benzil) and 
moderately polar (carbaryl and aldicarb) solids in triolein differ from those of the nonpolar 
solids in that the γmf values for the former are ≥ 1, ranging between 1 and 4, in conciliation 
with Raoult’s law.  With the recognized failure of Raoult’s law for nonpolar solids in triolein, 
the apparent fit of the polar-solid solubility data with Raoult’s law is essentially an artifact of 
the result that the large solute-solvent incompatibility equals or exceeds the counter 
size-disparity effect on the solid solubility. Hence, not knowing the solubility data of nonpolar 
solids, the solubility data of polar solids in triolein, or the respective γmf values, might well be 
 49
the inadequacy of the F-H model for the present solution system. Again, for some polar solids, 
e.g., dibenzothiophene, carbaryl, and aldicarb, in triolein, the higher-than-1 γfh values as 
calculated may be attributed to the enhanced solute-solvent incompatibility that outweighs the 
size-disparity effect to give a superficial confirmation of the F-H model.  
To explain why the F-H model may underestimate the solid solubility in liquid triolein or 
PPG, one recalls that the F-H model is intended for solutions of liquids in high amorphous 
polymers, where the configuration of sequential segments of a polymer molecule in space is 
subject to a significant restriction.  This limitation is ascribed to the fact that an amorphous 
polymer exhibits little molecular (translational and rotational) motion. Compared with 
amorphous polymers, triolein and PPG are liquids with unrestricted molecular motion that 
enables their flexible, solute-accessible segments (or fragments) to behave as if they were 
totally dissociated (or independent) units to enhance the entropy of solution with a solute. As 
such, the conventional F-H model would underestimate the solid solubilities in large-sized 
liquid triolein and PPG, or other large-sized liquid solvents.  
Following the preceding analysis, we now seek an alternative solution model that 
provides a higher solubility limit than given by the F-H model (eq 2) so that the resulting 
solute activity coefficients will be ≥1 for all solids. Since, as mentioned, the high molecular 
motion of a large-sized liquid solvent (over that of an amorphous polymer) enables its 
segments to act as n independent mixing units (where n is the solvent-to-solute size ratio), the 
“ideal” or “athermal” solubility of a solid with the solvent, shown in eq 3 below, should be 
higher than that given by eq 2 with the polymer. With the above postulate for a large-sized 
liquid solvent, one arrives at a simple volume-fraction solution model, which may be viewed 
as a limiting or modified F-H model, in which a solid’s “ideal” or “athermal” solubility is 
given by 
                    ln os  = ln as = – (Δ H f /R) [(Tm – T)/TTm]            
 51
solutions deviate from the “ideal “or “athermal” state with γ > 2 for the solute.  
We now consider other solubility or related data involving a similar solute-solvent size 
disparity. As indicated earlier, Shinoda and Hildebrand10,11 asserted that iodine forms “regular 
solutions”1 with relatively nonpolar compact-shaped solvents in that the mixing entropies of 
iodine with these solvents conform to those given by Raoult’s law.  The solvents claimed to 
form “regular solutions” with iodine span a large range of molecular sizes.  The data with 
two of these solvents, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, or (CH3)8Si4O4, and tetraperfluorobutyric 
ester of pentaerythritol, i.e., (C3F7COOCH2)4C, are of special interest for scrutiny because the 
ratios of their molar volumes (312 and 540 mL/mol, respectively) to the molar volume of 
liquid (dissolved) iodine (59 mL/mol) are relatively high (5.3 and 9.1, respectively) to render 
significantly different estimates of the mixing entropies by Raoult’s law (eq 1) and the 
modified volume-fraction model (eq 3).  Here, as the measured solubilities of solid iodine in 
most low-polarity solvents at room temperature are substantially below the ideal-solubility or 
athermal-solubility limits, the solubility data alone are not sufficient for judging the model 
performance. Thus, following the approach taken by Shinoda and Hildebrand, we here 
compare the measured entropies of solution of iodine against those estimated by the existing 
models.  
In a regular solution, where the deviation from ideality is caused exclusively by a thermal 
effect, the (partial) molar entropy of solution for the solute according to Raoult’s law is given 
by 
 lS  = – R ln oobx                                       
(4) 
where R is the gas constant and oobx is the solute mole-fraction solubility, as defined, at T. 
 53
solvents are very low, one finds  sS = R (dln oobx /dlnT) = R (dln oob /dlnT). 
Inspecting the data in Table 4, one finds that the measured  lS  values for dissolved 
iodine agree remarkably better with those estimated by the modified F-H model (eq 6) than by 
Raoult’s law (eq 4).  Although the conventional F-H model (eq 5) also shows an 
improvement over Raoult’s law in the prediction, the result is not as sharp as achieved with eq 
6. This observation contrasts the assertion by Shinoda and Hildebrand that the entropic effects 
of iodine in large compact solvents comply with the ideal-solution law (i.e., Raoult’s law). 
The present analysis reveals to the contrary that the molecular fragments in these large-sized 
compact solvents are quite accessible to iodine molecules, and thus a large excess in entropy 
of mixing is gained over that estimated by the iodine mole fraction. This finding is 
enlightening in that the deviation from ideality of a solution caused by a size disparity usually 
occurs in systems where either the solvent or the solute is of a large-sized linear molecule. 
The entropic data here manifest that a similar deviation occurs even with a large-sized 
compact molecule so long as its fragments are accessible to other components (solute or 
solvent). Hence, the entropy of mixing for a component in a regular solution should generally 
be more accurately estimated by use of its volume fraction instead of the mole fraction. 
From the illustrated data, the two volume-fraction-based activity models (eqs 2 and 3) are 
clearly superior to the mole-fraction-based activity model (eq 1) to describe the solute 
solubility (or activity) in systems that exhibit a significant component-size disparity and no 
molecular association. This viewpoint is substantiated by other observations, such as: (i) the 
success of the F-H model over Raoult’s law to describe the solubility and partitioning of 
compounds with the soil organic matter,16-18 and (ii) the similar partition coefficients for given 
organic solutes in octanol-water and triolein-water mixtures, where the two organic solvents 
exhibit sharply different molecular sizes but comparable polarities, in agreement with the 
modified volume-fraction model (eq 3).9  The relative applicability of eq 2 versus eq 3 is
