optical design. The optical design proposed in this paper employs four lens groups to lay out the 2X zoom with 
liquid optics, of which the overall length must be under 20mm. In addition, liquid optics will mostly control the 
optical power of the zoom in such a way as to replace traditional zoom cams.  
The liquid lenses named ARCTIC 416 of the simulation are produced by Varioptic SA [4].  Figure 1 
shows a chart of the prototype. The specifications of liquid optics ARCTIC 416 are shown in Tables 1 and 2. 
The optical design layout in this research for a 2X optical zoom module with liquid lens elements is shown in 
Table 3, inclusive of the specifications of lens optics. Figures 2 and 3 show the two dimensional (2D) plots and 
modulation transform function (MTF) diagram in each zoom, optimized by Code V software. Finally, Table 4 
lists the lens prescription.

In order to eliminate aberrations, such as the large aberrations caused by the vast bending of the chief rays, 
added thicknesses must be added to the lens in the front element and the element between the liquid optics, not 
only because of the need to eliminate the incident angle of the chief rays between the front elements but also 
because of the need to minimize the front diameter of the front groups. According to optical design experience, 
a slight negative power behind a group of liquid optics is set in order to eliminate the aberration when the first 
liquid optics delivers strong positive power. From point view of optical zoom, liquid lenses inherently prefer to 
behave as positive rather than negative lenses, although they may have slight negative power. Therefore, it 
complicates optical design if we force the liquid optics group, composed of both liquid optics, to take over most 
zoom jobs. To attain this goal, a strong negative lens must be added after the liquid optics module (that is, S6, 
S9, S10 and S13) in order to achieve sufficient optical power variation between the two sets of liquid optics to 
produce the best zoom effect. In the optical design, the work of zoom variation during the optimization of the 
two liquid optics employed in this lens is restricted by constraints in the settings. It is estimated that, in this 
research, the liquid optics contribute up to 80% of the zoom variation. The last group is used as a compensator 
handled by a precise step motor.  
With regard to the inherent problem of liquid optics, it is understood that the aspheric surface coefficients of 
both surfaces of liquid optics vary non-linearly with the optical power of liquid optics, thus complicating the 
optimization with DLS. In this research, a new method is proposed, that of digitalizing each zoom of the 2X 
zoom optics, which indicate that it works only if defined as an “effective zoom ratio” of zoom optics such as 
1.0X, 1.05X, 1.1X, etc. This allows the aspheric coefficient of the liquid optics to be measured, because its 
optical power is precisely defined. Then the traditional DLS method will work well for optimizing the zoom 
optics with a digitalized zoom ratio with aspheric coefficients. However, there will be no function of the zoom 
optics between the digitalized zoom ratios.  
In this optical design, a digitalized zoom ratio is defined as gradually increasing by 0.125X on each step up 
to 2X. In total, nine degrees of zoom are optimized by CODE V from the initial layout.  
where the max is a fitness value of the worst individual and the sum is the sum of the fitness values in each 
generation.

(3). Crossover and mutation operation  
First, if two chromosomes x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) and y = (y1, y2, ..., yn) from the population are selected randomly 
according the roulette wheel method, then the crossover operation can be determined on the basis of the 
crossover rate pc in the next step. In this case, a multi-point crossover method is used for crossover strategy. 
The  is a random number from 0 to 1. If  ≧ 0.5, then the chromosomes xi and yi interchange, but otherwise 
they do not. Figure 5 shows the multi-point crossover operation.  
After the crossover operation, a multi-point mutation method is used for the mutation strategy. The  is a 
random number from 0 to 1. If  ≦ pm, then execute:

where  is a random number from 0 to 1, and ui and li are the upper and lower boundaries of xi.   
A GA program is employed in this research not only to eliminate chromatic aberrations and field curves 
during optimization but also to find the best solution for a discrete zoom set to minimize the aberration. The 
wavelength setting of the ray is determined according to the visible light, as shown in Table 5. Table 6 gives the 
weight setting of Fit(n) (Equation 1 above the paragraph), and Table 7 gives the parameter setting, Figure 6 
gives the gene mapping in the GA program. The multi-point crossover method is used for each gene in the 
crossover operation. The multi-point mutation method (Equation 3) is used for each curvature and thickness 
gene and the glass gene is chosen randomly from the glass database in the mutation operation.

optimization, in which S15 is the 15th lens surface in the lens design. Figure 12 contains the MTF diagrams 
after extended optimization via the modified GA program.  
From the result of the simulation, it is concluded that CODE V with a modified GA more successfully 
extended the optimization of this zoom optics with liquid optics than the traditional DLS method did. The MTF 
of optics averagely reaches the optical diffraction limit except in the 1.0 field without the assistance of an 
aspheric surface.

it is shown in the results that AX of the zoom optics with liquid lens has been improved by 39.68%, compared 
to the initial system and that the LAT is 77.02%, sagittal field curves are 84.97%, tangential field curves are 
75.92% and finally the  spot size is minimized up to 48.86% under at least 85% relative illumination, while the 
MTF almost reaches the optical diffraction limit except at the extreme edge of the image circle, unlike the 
traditional DLS method.  
The aspheric surface of liquid optics, if it could be precisely measured by an advanced interferometer, 
significantly improves the final performance of this zoom optics.
