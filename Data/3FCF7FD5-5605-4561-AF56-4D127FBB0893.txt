監視器經常安裝於道路上，以協助監視行人與駕駛人的安全。在台灣，警方使用所謂的
「e-巡邏」系統來協助警員巡邏的任務，藉由e-巡邏系統的協助，警方已多次破獲不少犯罪案
件。所謂的e-巡邏系統，即是利用馬路與街頭巷尾上的24小時監視器畫面，來協助巡邏。過去
多年來，e-巡邏系統的監視器畫面除了協助破獲犯罪案件、維護社區的安全外，亦廣泛地被用
來協助交通意外事故的責任判定，以及提供保險公司的理賠重要參考。眾所周知，道路上不

Surveillance cameras are usually set on lanes to improve the safety of drivers and walkers. In
Taiwan, the so-caled “E-Patrol”system is used to support policemen for providing patrol services.
The policemen have also solved several criminal cases with the use of surveillance cameras of
“E-Patrol”system. Surveillance cameras are operative 24 hours per day. The films by the surveil-
lance cameras would be useful to judge the responsibility of drivers and walkers for insurance com-
panies and to improve the security of communities. It is well known that inappropriate settings of
surveillance cameras will result in some dead angles and dead space. On the other hand, oversetting
of surveillance cameras will waste limited resources. Therefore, the setting of surveillance cameras is
an important issue. In this research, (i) we introduce the new surveillance camera location problem,
(ii) derive the exact closed forms of optimal locations for single-type surveillance cameras on straight
lanes, (iii) apply a PSO algorithm for the optimal locations of multiple-type surveillance cameras on
straight lanes, and (iv) propose a new hybrid IA-PSO approach which combines both the immune
based algorithm and a PSO based algorithm to obtain the optimal design of multi-type surveillance
cameras. Numerical results are reported and compared with those by well known software LINGO.
Limited numerical results show the excellent performance of proposed PSO and IA-PSO approaches.
1. Introduction
It is known that surveillance cameras are usually set on lanes to improve the safety of drivers and
walkers. In Taiwan, the so-caled “E-Patrol”system is used to support policemen for providing patrol
services. The policemen have also solved several criminal cases with the use of surveillance cameras
of “E-Patrol”system. Surveillance cameras are operative 24 hours per day. The films by the surveil-
lance cameras would be useful to judge the responsibility of drivers and walkers for insurance com-
panies and to improve the security of communities. It is well known that inappropriate settings of
surveillance cameras will result in some dead angles and dead space. On the other hand, oversetting
of surveillance cameras will waste limited resources. Therefore, the setting of surveillance cameras
is an important issue and a complex location problem.
There are at least three main issues usually considered for the location of surveillance camera
system, namely:
(a) Coverage.
Erdem and Sclaroff [1] converted a continuous domain of a plane into a discrete domain (with grids)
and proposed a 0-1 integer programming to solve for the optimal locations of cameras such that all
discrete grid-points in the specific areas are monitored by at least one camera. Their objective func-
tion is to minimize the total cost of cameras. Clearly, it is a typical set covering problem. The main
drawback of their approach is time consuming, especially when the number of grids is large.
(b) Resolution.

Assumptions.
(a) The surveillance cameras are statistically independent (s-independent).
(b) Due to limited budget in most real cases, assume that, for any point XΩ, there are at most two
adjacent surveillance cameras to monitor the point (see Fig. 1).
(c) The detection failure probability of point XΩ to the surveillance camera located at xij, R (X,xij),
is a monotonically increasing function of d(X,xij). In this paper, we consider in particular the
following function.

Mathematical Model.
The problem can be formulated as the following nonlinear mixed-integer programming.
5Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 ([9]). As known, PSO is similar to the other evolutionary computa-
tion techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) etc. However, unlike GA, PSO has no evolution
operators such as crossover and mutation (Michalewicz [10]). PSO is attractive because that there
are very few parameters to be adjusted, and it can achieve the optimal or near-optimal solutions in a
rather short timewithout enormous iterative computations in digital implementation. Therefore, in
the past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in several research and application areas,
e.g., Zhang et al. [11] and Onwubolu and Celerc [12] etc.
In PSO, particles move toward the pbest position and gbest position with each iteration in which
the pbest position is the best position found by each particle so far and the gbest position is the best
position found by the swarm so far. Each particle moves according to its velocity and the velocity is
randomly generated toward pbest and gbest positions. For each particle k and dimension j, the veloc-
ity and position of particles are updated by the following equations.
  kjkjoldkjnewkj xpbestrandcwvv 11  kjj xgbestrandc  22 (8)
kjkjkj vxx  (9)
where vkj is the velocity of particle k on dimension j, and xkj is the position of particle k on dimension
j. The pbestkj is the pbest position of particle k on dimension j, and gbestj is the gbest position of the
swarm on dimension j. We refer the interested readers to the excellent webpage at
http://www.swarmintelligence.org/ for more details and related articles of PSO.
PSO Algorithm.
The main steps of PSO algorithm include:
Step 1. Initialize population, velocity and position.
Step 2. Evaluation fitness based upon Eq. (4).
Step 3. Find the pbest and the gbest.
Step 4. Update the velocity and position based upon Eq. (8) and Eq. (9).
Step 5. Go to Step 2 until the stopping criterion is satisfied.
Step 6. Output the optimal or near-optimal solution.
Numerical Results.
To investigate the performance of the proposed PSO approach for multiple-type surveillance
cameras on straight lanes, we assume that the total budget (TB) varies from 100 to 450 with the in-
crease of 50. Without loss of generality, we assume that |L|=1 and the exponentλ=4 for all test prob-
lems. For convenience, we set the maximal number of surveillance cameras be twelve for each lane.
The values of parameters of test problems are shown in Table 1.
In this paper, we discretize the lane into 100 points. And then evaluate the detection failure
probability of each point by Eq. (3) to all surveillance cameras. Note that the locations of surveil-
lance cameras are real numbers in (0,1). The original values of types of surveillance cameras are all
also real numbers in (0,1), and we use the mapping: [0.75,1)Type A, [0.5,0.75)Type B,
[0.25,0.5)Type C, (0,0.25)Type D, to obtain the discrete types of surveillance cameras. In addi-
tion, for simplicity, we let N=min{TB/10, 12} for all test problems. For each test problem, we test 20
trials by the proposed PSO approach. Numerical results are reported in Table 2 and compared with
those by the well known software LINGO ([8]). All results are computed by Intel-Pentium IV 3.0
GHz PC and programs are coded in MATLAB 2006.
75. IA-PSO Approach for Multiple-Type Surveillance Cameras
In this first stage of IA-PSO approach, we will use the so-called immune based algorithm to
approximate the number, types, and locations of surveillance cameras. In the second stage, we will
fix the numbers of surveillance cameras, and then propose a PSO based algorithm to improve the
approximations of types and locations of surveillance cameras.
Immune System
The natural immune system of all animals is a very complex system for defense against patho-
genic organisms. A two-tier line of defense in the system includes the innate immune system and the
adaptive immune system. The basic components are lymphocytes and antibodies [13]. The cells of
the innate immune system are immediately available to combat against a wide variety of antigen
without previous exposure to them. The antibody production in response to a determined infectious
agent (antigen) is the adaptive immune response mediated by lymphocytes which are responsible for
recognition and elimination of the pathogenic agents [14]. The cells in the adaptive system are able
to develop an immune memory so that they can recognize the same antigenic stimulus when it is
presented to the organism again. Also, all the antibodies are produced only in response to specific
infections. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes (B-cells) and T-lymphocytes
(C-cells). B-cells and T-cells carry surface receptor molecules capable of recognizing antigens. The
B-cells produced by the bone marrow show a distinct chemical structure and can be programmed to
make only one antibody that is placed on the outer surface of the lymphocyte to act as a receptor.
The antigens will only bind to these receptors with which it makes a good fit [15].
To distinguish and eliminate the intruders of the organism is the main task of the immune system
so that it must has the capability of self/non-self discrimination. As mentioned previously, various
antibodies can be produced and then can recognize the specific antigens. The portion of antigen rec-
ognized by antibody is called epitope which acts as an antigen determinant. Every type of antibody
has its own specific antigen determinant which is called idiotope. Moreover, in order to produce
enough specific effector cells to against an infection, and activated lymphocyte has to proliferate and
then differentiate into these effector cells. This process is called clonal selection ([16]) and followed
by the genetic operations such that a large clone of plasma cell is formed. Therefore, the antibodies
can be secreted and ready to bind antigens. According to above facts, Jerne [17] proposed an
idio-type network hypothesis which is based on the clonal selection theory. In his hypothesis, some
types of recognizing sets are activated by some antigens and produce an antibody which will then
activate other types of recognizing sets. By this way, the activation is propagated through entire
network of recognizing sets via antigen-antibody reactions. It is noted that the antigen identification
is not done by a single or multiple recognizing sets but by antigen-antibody interactions. From this
point of view, for solving the optimization problems, the antibody and antigen can be treated as the
solution and objective function, respectively. More details are referred to Huang [15, 18].
IA-PSO Approach
Stage-I：Immune Based Algorithm
The main steps of the proposed immune based algorithm are as follows:
Step 1.Generate an initial population of strings randomly.
Step 2.Evaluate each individual in current population and calculate the corresponding fitness value
for each individual.
Step 3.Select the best n individuals with highest fitness values.
Step 4.Clone the best n individuals (antibodies) selected on Step 3. Note that the clone size for each
select individual is an increasing function of the affinity with the antigen.

Numerical results
To investigate the performance of our proposed two-phase approach, we test the following vari-
ous traffic systems, including straight lanes, circles and the combinations which are listed in Table 3
and Fig. 5. Note that for the test problem of Combination-II, we assume that the maximal allowable
failure detection probabilities for lane A to lane G are 0.001, 0.007, 0.008, 0.007, 0.007, 0.009, 0.001,
respectively. For convenience, we set the maximal number of surveillance cameras be twelve for
each lane/circle. The parameters of IA are set as population=100, generation=2000, affinity=0.25,
crossover=0.89, mutation=0.02. The values of parameters of test problems are shown in Table 3.
Note that without loss of generality, we set the exponent λ=4 for al test problems. Programs are
coded in MATLAB 2006 and all results are computed by Intel-Pentium IV 3.0GHz PC.
11
for the circle test problems in Table 5 when TB=200, the failure detection probability is 0.000530,
and when TB=300, the failure detection probability is 0.000278. The main reason is that it tends
to use more and higher types of cameras when there are more budgets.
(d) When the budget is high enough, then the effect of increasing budget will decrease. For example,
in the Combination-I test problem in Table 6, when TB=400 the failure detection probability is
0.012975, and when TB=500 it is 0.007477, but when TB=600, it is only 0.007476.
(e) Table 7 shows that the proposed IA-PSO approach can effectively find a pretty good solution
under hybrid probability-constraints for Combination-II test problem. For example, for road B
the failure detection probability constraint is subject to 0.0070 and the obtained failure detection
probability for this road is 0.006904, and for road D the probability constraint is subject to
0.0070 and the obtained failure detection probability for this road is 0.006374. The maximal
failure detection probability for the Combination-II test problem is 0.008335 on road F. Fig. 6
depicts the types and locations of all surveillance cameras.

論文摘要
Optimizing the Patrol Routing Problem with Multiple Cars : An Effective
Evolutionary Approach
ABSTRACT. In this paper, we investigate a new patrol routing problem (PRP) in
which the policemen have to patrol several nodes with specific multiple times during
a certain planning horizon. The PRP is a practical problem in Taiwan and an NP-hard
problem. In this paper, we develop an immune based evolutionary approach for
solving the considered problem. In addition, an efficient coding scheme is proposed
to tackle both the combination and the permutation of nodes simultaneously. A
practical example with multiple cars is solved to illustrate the performance of the
approach.
Keywords: Optimization, Immune algorithm, Multiple cars

論文摘要
An Effective Immune Based Approach for the No-Wait Flow Shop
Scheduling Problems with Multiple Machines
Abstract. For scheduling problems, no-wait constraint is an important requirement
for many industries. As known, the no-wait scheduling problem is NP-hard and has
several practical applications. This paper applies an immune algorithm to solve the
multiple-machine no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with minimizing the
makespan. Twenty-three benchmark problems on the OR-Library are solved by the
immune algorithm. Limited numerical results show that the immune algorithm
performs better than the other typical approaches in the literature for most of
instances.
Keywords: Flow shop scheduling, No-wait, Immune algorithm.

四、建議
最後將心得整理如下，供參考。
1. 此次會議中，除了本身發表論文外，本人亦參加聽取幾場發表會，其中較為深刻
的是，以 Broderick Crawford等學者以混合人工智慧方法探討人事規劃問題 (題
目：Hybrid Approach to Crew Pairing Optimization) 及 Hamid Parvin等學者以基因
演算法於分類最佳化問題之應用(題目：Classification and Optimization by Genetic
Algorithm)。出席此二場會議，使我對混合資訊技術的應用面有更深一層的啟法。
2. 眾多釜山鄰近大學之博士班研究生亦參與此國際研討會，其強烈的求知欲與主動
令人印象深刻，國內博士班、碩士班研究生更應積極參與國際研討會以增廣見聞
與擴大國際視野。

論文摘要
A Genetic Based Algorithm to a Dynamic Logistics Problem
Abstract. Topics on reverse logistics have been discussed over the years. Most of
them are dealt with by assuming that facilities are kept open once they are established,
and no inventory is stocked at intermediate recycling stations. By simultaneously
relaxing these two assumptions, this paper studies a reverse logistics system with
multiple items of which each consists of some components among a variety of spare
parts. The purpose is to maximize the total profit by establishing a production
schedule and reverse logistics framework over a finite time periods for a logistics
system. The mathematic model established in this research is a constrained non-linear
integer programming problem. A genetic based algorithm with the help of linear
programming is developed to find solutions to this problem. Computational
experiments show that the proposed approach is superior to the well-known CPLEX
software in terms of both solution quality and computational effectiveness.
Keywords: Reverse Logistics, Genetic Algorithm, Integer Programming.
