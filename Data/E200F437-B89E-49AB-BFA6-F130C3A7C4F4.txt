counter rotating vortices can be clearly observed, where
the high momentum fluid in the central core is trans-
ported to the corner region by the secondary flow. The
presence of the moving wall does influence the patterns
of the secondary flow, where the two clockwise rotating
vortices gradually merge in tandem with speed of the
moving wall. In the CP2 and 3 cases, the top counter-
clockwise vortex resides in the top corner, thus blocking
the momentum transfer to the wall. By measuring the
angle between the top two vortices relative to the hori-
zontal x axis, it is interesting to note that a linear relation
exits between the angle and the parameter r, as shown in
Figure 2, between CP1 to CP3 cases. Distance between
the vortex cores of each vortex pair is also observed to
remain approximately constant.
Local wall stress distributions along the top moving
and bottom stationary walls are shown in Figure 3. For
all the cases considered in Table I, the distributions at
the stationary wall follow that of a turbulent Poiseuille
flow. On the other hand, wall stresses along the moving
wall show dramatic different profiles. The zero wall stress

4ishes. The angle between the two top vortices is found to
correlate with the ratio of the speed of the moving wall
and the duct bulk velocity. At the bottom half of the duct
near the stationary wall, turbulence intensities are sim-
ilar of all cases considered, indicating that the moving
wall influence is not significant. On the contrary, near
the top moving wall, gradual reductions of turbulence
are predicted in tandem with the increase of the speed
of the wall. Along the wall-bisector, the turbulence dis-
tribution is similar to the plane Couette-Poiseuille flow.
However, this similarity breaks down in locations close
to the side wall. Also, the anisotropy invariant analysis
indicate that along the wall bisector at the top half of
the duct, turbulence structure gradually moves towards
a rod-like axi-symmetric state as the speed of the moving
wall increases.

turbulence modeling. There are approximately 140 participants and about 80 
presentations. Since there is only one session, therefore the presenter has ample 
time to present his work. In the meeting, there are five participants from Taiwan 
and three of them presented papers. I presented my paper entitled “Boundary 
conditions for flows with complex geometry” on Friday afternoon 20th July. 
Although it was near the end of the conference, the number of attending physicians 
is still substantial. There were two questions raised regarding the content of the 
presentation. One was the numerical accuracy of our proposed method and the 
other one was related to the bench mark solutions. After my presentations several 
delegates came forward to request copies of my presented material. 
二、 與會心得 
Since this conference deals with emerging computing technologies, there are many 
new developments in different related field. I am pleased to attend the meeting and 
had a broad discussion with colleagues around the globe and exchanged results of 
the research outcomes. This helps our progress in this area and expands our view of 
research in the related fields using this new technology.

along the curved boundary. The difficulties encountered are two folds. Firstly
the representation of the complex geometry, since the Cartesian grid does
not conform with the curved boundary. Secondly the correct implementation
of the boundary conditions, where unknown distribution functions originated
from the undefined solid nodes external to the flow domain are encountered
during the streaming operation.
Various methodologies have been put forward to tackle the LBM simulation
of complex geometry flows. For example, Chen et al. [5] extended the “ex-
trapolation scheme” to curved boundary, where The boundary is represented
by the lattice nodes closest to the curved surface using castellated approach.
The adjacent nodes whose distribution functions streaming to the castellated
boundary nodes are inside the solid domain, and the distribution functions at
these solid nodes are calculated using a second order extrapolation. Filippova
and Hanel[6] proposed a method using a simple linear interpolation between
a fictitious equilibrium distribution function and a well-chosen near-boundary
distribution function. The weighting factor of the interpolation is determined
by the distance between the boundary and the near-boundary lattice. Mei
et al.[7] further improved its numerical stability. Lallemand and Luo[8] com-
bined the bounce-back scheme and interpolation scheme to treat a moving
curved boundary by the lattice Boltzmann method. The bounce-back scheme
simulates a stationary boundary, and an additional term is added to imple-
ment a moving boundary. This treatment is an extension of that proposed by
Bouzidi et al.[9]. One point boundary condition was proposed by Junk and
Yang[10], where a correction to the bounce back boundary condition improves
the accuracy of pressure and velocity.
Alternatively, the immersed boundary method (IBM) is another convenient
approach to treat fluid flows involving complex boundary, though it was for-
mulated mostly within the Navier-Stkes equation framework. The complex
geometry within the Cartesian grid can be simulated by generating exter-
nal force field to mimic the immersed boundary. IBM can be categorized as
feedback forcing[11,12] and direct forcing[13] approaches. However, the major
drawback of the existing feedback forcing is the restriction of small CFL num-
ber. Aiming at improving the CFL number restriction, Su et al.[14] proposed
a new immersed boundary (IB) technique for the simulation of flows interact-
ing with solid boundary. In Chen et al.[15], the lattice Boltzmann method is
combined with the immersed boundary technique of Su et al.[14] to simulate
flows with complex boundary.
In the present study, the curved boundary is represented by a series of La-
grangian markers. The fluid velocity of node adjacent to the solid boundary
is obtained by linear interpolation between the Lagrangian marker and the
second fluid node further away. Then distribution functions originates from
the solid domain at the nodes adjacent to the immersed curved boundary are

and the weighting factors are ω0 = 4/9, ωi=1,2,3,4 = 1/9, and ωi=5,6,7,8 = 1/36.
Moreover, the speed of sound is Cs = c/
√
3 and the corresponding kinematic
viscosity is ν = (τ − 0.5)C2sdt in the simulation.
2.2 The curved boundary technique
Along the boundary, fi(~x, t) due to the inward streaming operations may
originate from the solid nodes external to the flow domain, therefore measures
have to be taken to prescribe these unknown particle distribution functions,
which are denoted as fi=p(~x, t). Obviously, fi 6=p(~x, t) = f+i 6=p(~x − ~eidt, t − dt),
as shown in equation 2.
The unknown particle distribution functions at these nodes are expressed as[1],
fp(~x, t) = f
∗
p (~x, t) +
αp
c
~ep · ~Q (8)
where the formulation of f ∗p is denoted as,
f ∗p (~x, t) = fp(~x, t− dt) (9)
It can be seen that Eq. (9) involves the previous nodal value and a correction.
This can be applied along the boundary of the computational domain, where
no inward streaming node is available. However, if the boundary is immersed
in the flow domain, then for simplicity f ∗p can be adopted as,
f ∗p (~x, t) = f
+(~x− ~epdt, t− dt) (10)
which is the distribution function streaming from the solid domain, which is
of course not correct and needs to be corrected. Correction ~Q is determined
by the prescribed velocity boundary conditions. Also, αp = ωp. Therefore, the
general form of the macroscopic velocity and density along the boundary using
Eq. (3), in conjunction with Eqs. (2) and (8), can be expressed as,
ρ = ρ∗ + βdxQx + βdyQy (11)
ρu = ρ∗u∗ + βuxQx + βuyQy (12)
ρv = ρ∗v∗ + βvxQx + βvyQy (13)

In this test, the computational domain is chosen as [-L,L]x[-L,L] where L=1.
The dimensionless relaxation time is τ = 0.65, the Reynolds number is UL/ν=10,
and the computations are all up to time Ut/L = 1. Four different uniform grids
(N × N,N = 41, 81, 161, 321) are used in the simulations. The Eulerian grid
spacing is ∆x = ∆y = 2/(N − 1), the time step size is ∆t = ∆x.
The exact time varying conditions are imposed along the nodes external to the
circular immersed boundary, where the radius is 0.5. The predicted velocity
vector and the immersed circular boundary are shown in Fig. 4, where the ve-
locity vector is clearly not influenced by the presence of the circular boundary.
Fig. 5 shows the maximum (or L∞) errors for the solutions at time Ut/L = 1,
where the errors for the Eulerian grid velocity component u are listed. The
rate of convergence is computed by taking logarithmic for the ratio of the two
successive errors as Rate = log2

, where EN denotes the error of the grid

accurate.
3.2 Flow over an asymmetrically placed cylinder in a channel
The flow past a stationary circular cylinder is a typical problem and has
been widely investigated[14,15,17,18]. For Reynolds number below 47, the
flow structure remains steady with stationary recirculating vortices behind the
cylinder. As the Reynolds number is elevated, the steadiness breaks down and
the vortex starts to shed up and down alternatively. This shedding frequency
and the intensity of the vortex also increase in tandem with the elevated level
of the Reynolds number.
Schafer and Turek[17] reported a set of 2D and 3D benchmark results for lam-
inar flows over a circular cylinder of radius r that is asymmetrically placed
inside a channel. The distances from the center of the cylinder to the upper
wall and lower wall are 4.2r and 4.0r, respectively. The 2D geometric layout
is shown in Fig. 6. The inlet boundary is placed at 4 radii upstream of the
cylinder center, l+ = 4.0r, and the exit boundary is located 40 radii down-
stream of the cylinder center. In the present study, r = 30∆x is used. The

vortex shedding is observed. The drag and lift coefficient have a periodic fluctu-
ation, as shown in Fig. 7 and 8. Two peaks in the drag coefficients correspond
to the existence of a weaker vortex and a stronger vortex alternately shed
behind the cylinder. This phenomenon is due to the cylinder is asymmetry
placed in the channel. Instantaneous vorticity contour at Re = 100 is shown
in Fig. 9. Table 2 lists the maximum of CD, CL and the Strouhal number of
the simulation. The present results are shown to be compatible with previous
numerical methods. The predicted Strouhal number St = 2r/UaveT is 0.3002.
This agrees very well with the range of Strouhal number (0.2950-0.3050) given
in Ref.[17].
4 Conclusion
In this paper, boundary condition using lattice Boltzmann method to simu-
late flows with curved geometry is proposed. The curved boundary is repre-
sented by a series of Lagrangian markers and the closest nodes adjacent to the
boundary in the fluid domain are used as boundary nodes of the flow domain.
The fluid velocity of the boundary node is obtained by linear interpolation
between the velocities of the Lagrangian marker and the second fluid node
further away. Then the distribution functions originates from the solid do-
main at the boundary nodes are modified using known distribution functions
and correctors to satisfy the momentum. This boundary technique is an ex-
tended form of a method proposed by Hou et al. [1] for plane wall and corner.
The technique is examined by simulating decaying vortex and 2D flow over
an asymmetrically placed cylinder. Numerical simulations indicate that this
method is second order accurate, and all the numerical results are compatible
with the benchmark solutions.
