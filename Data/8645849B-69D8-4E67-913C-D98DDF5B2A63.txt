III. REVIEW OF QRM-MLD ALGORITHM
A. ML Detection via QR Decomposition and Tree Search
Consider the QR decomposition of the channel matrix H,
H = QR where Q is an nr-by-nt matrix with orthonormal
columns, and R is an upper-triangular matrix of size nt-by-nt.
and with real diagonal elements. Left multiplying the received
signal vector y by QH , we obtain
z
∆
=QHy = Rx + w (2)
where w ∆=QHn can be shown to have the same distribution
as n, and the superscript H denotes the complex conjugation
operator. It can be shown that the ML solution is
xˆML = arg min
x∈Cnt
‖z−Rx‖2 (3)
where ‖·‖ is the Euclidean norm. Denoting the (i, j)-th ele-
ment of R as Ri,j , the squared Euclidean distance between z
and Rx, denoted by ξ(x), can be expressed as
ξ(x) =

. (4)
With the following definitions and mappings, xˆML can
be obtained via searching for the path with the minimum
Euclidean distance in a tree diagram. Figure 1 shows the
corresponding tree diagram for a 3-by-3 MIMO system with
BPSK modulation. Observe that the depth of the tree is nt, i.e.,
the tree consists of (nt + 1) levels with level 0 corresponding
to the root node. Extending out of each node are |C| branches;
the end of each branch is then attached with a child node. The
entire tree is formed by iterating from level 0 (i.e., the root
node) to level nt − 1; in each iteration, branch extension is
done for all the nodes at the tip of the current tree.
For each node at level i (i ∈ {0, · · · , nt − 1}), the j-th
outgoing branch (with the index j ∈ {0, · · · , |C| − 1} labeled
from top to bottom) represents the hypothesized transmitted
symbol xnt−i = cj where cj is the j-th point of C (refer
to Figure 1). Traversing from the root node to a given node
at level i (i ∈ {1, · · · , nt}), the visited branches constitute
a path which determines a particular symbol vector xi by
concatenating along the way the symbol associated with each
constituent branch. Specifically,
xi
∆
= [xnt , · · · , xnt−i+1] (5)
where the subscript of xi denotes that the ending node of this
path is at level i, and the underline notation signifies a row
vector. For notational convenience, we say that the state of
the ending node of this path is xi. At level nt of the tree,
hence, there are a total of |C|nt nt-branch paths, representing
all the possible transmitted symbol vectors x. For example,
the path highlighted in Figure 1 corresponds to the sequence
xnt = [x3 = −1, x2 = 1, x1 = 1].
The squared Euclidean distance ξ(x) defined in (4) is
associated with each nt-branch path in the tree diagram based
on the following rules. The j-th branch of a path xi (i.e., the
one connecting between levels j− 1 and j) is associated with
a branch metric (BM)

where x(1:j)i
∆
= [xnt , · · · , xnt−j+1] is the subpath of xi, con-
sisting of the first j branches of xi. Note that x
(1:i)
i = xi.
Here the inclusion of x(1:j)i in the notation of λj stresses
the dependence on the hypothesized modulation symbols
xnt , · · · , xnt−j+1 only, due to the upper triangular structure of
R. Furthermore, each path xi is associated with a path metric
(PM) ξi(xi), defined as the sum of the BMs of its constituent
branches:
ξi(xi)
∆
=
i∑
k=1
λk(x

i )
= ξi−1(x
(1:i−1)
i ) + λi(xi). (7)
Comparing (4) and (7), it follows that ξ(x) = ξnt(xnt). Thus,
it is clear that, at level nt, the path with the minimum path
metric gives xˆML .
BMs among the |C| outgoing branches, and are thus what
should be retained.
As long as the constellation exhibits sufficient symmetry (as
is the case for the modulation schemes used in practice), set
partitioning enables an efficient two-step procedure of finding
these S closest points without explicitly computing BMs: (a)
For each signal subset defined by the S-subset partitioning,
perform a slicing operation on zˆnt−i+1(x
(1:i−1)
i ). This yields
the winning constellation point that gives the minimum BM
within each subset. (b) Collect the winning constellation point
from each of the S subsets.
It should be noted that, for the proposed algorithm, only
after the decisions of branch selection are made is computing
BMs required – for the purpose of obtaining the PMs of the
newly extended paths (refer to (7)). However, only S BMs
(instead of |C| BMs) per node are required for computing
PMs, which leads to complexity reduction. Although the value
of S is restricted to be an integer power of 2, the simulation
results shown in Section V-A suggest that little complexity
increase is incurred by such a quantization operation.
C. Adaptive Set Partitioning (ASP)
In time-varying channels typically encountered in wireless
communication applications, a larger value of S should be
used in anticipation of deep fades in order to minimize the
chances of the correct hypothesis being eliminated prema-
turely. Thus, it is advantageous to adapt S based on the channel
condition experienced by each transmitted stream in order to
achieve a better tradeoff between error-rate performance and
complexity. Below, we formulate the criterion that is used to
adapt S when the approach outlined in Section IV-B is used
for branch selection.
1) Motivation: Denote Si as the number of retained
branches that leave a given node at level i − 1. We would
like to choose the value of Si based on the following crite-
rion. For each node, the probability that the outgoing branch
corresponding to the correct symbol hypothesis is excluded in
the branch selection process can not exceed a pre-specified
target level Pt. From the discussion in section IV-B, this is
equivalent to requiring the probability that the correct hypoth-
esis falls within the most likely Si branches (or equivalently,
the probability that the BM of the correct hypothesis is ranked
among the Si smallest ones) to be above 1 − Pt. It follows
from (9) that Si should be set to be the minimum integer that
satisfies

where γi
∆
=Rnt−i+1,nt−i+1, the superscript ∗ denotes the true
hypothesis, and x<m>nt−i+1 corresponds to the outgoing branch
with the m-th smallest BM. However, the exact solution to (12)
requires computation of BMs (i.e., (9)) for all |C| branches,
which again defeats the purpose of complexity savings. We
use the following approach to get around such a dilemma.

2) Determination of the Number of Subsets: The probabil-
ity that the BM of the correct symbol hypothesis x∗nt−i+1 is
not ranked among the smallest Si BMs can be approximated
by the probability of event A that the correct hypothesis falls
outside of the square box that centers at z˜nt−i+1(x
(1:i−1)
i ) and
encloses Si constellation points (as illustrated in Figure 3).
Assuming the constellation is sufficiently large such that
the continuous approximation [9] holds and the effects of
points at the edge of constellation are negligible, the side
of such a box is 2

are the minimum distances of the transmitted and received

the specified performance level and using the assumption that
each entry of w is an i.i.d. Gaussian r.v. with zero mean and
variance σ2n, we have

be ignored. Furthermore, let Smax denote the largest allowable
value of Si that is set by the implementation constraints and
the size of constellation, i.e., Smax ≤ |C|. It follows that
the minimum integer value for Si that satisfies (13) and the
constraints in complexity and constellation size is found to be

same level, Si obtained from (15) takes on a common value,

setting Pt = 1 × 10−4 gives a performance that is essentially
the same as that of the ML detector.
C. Complexity
We focus on the two measures: number of real multiplica-
tions and comparisons that are required to perform detection
of nt symbols (i.e., nt parallel streams) in one symbol period.
The results shown in Figure 5 (a) and (b), respectively, are
obtained with the same simulation scenario in Figure 4. The
approach of [4] is used as a reference because it is a reduced-
complexity version of [6]. At the SNRs of interest (i.e., at
an SER of 1 × 10−3 and 1 × 10−4), it can be seen that the
number of comparison operations required by the proposed
algorithm is about an order of magnitude smaller than that
of [4], and that there is about 25% saving in multiplication
operations. Figure 6 shows the distributions of the values of
Si estimated by the proposed algorithm across different tree
levels in the same scenario as Figure 5 2. Together with the
closeness of the SER to that of the ML detector, we see that
in most cases, a relatively small Si is sufficient to cover the
correct hypothesis in branch extension, thus leading to the
complexity reduction. This also explains why the quantization
of the number of subsets into an integer power of 2 to exploit
the nice structure of Ungerboeck’s set partitioning incurs little
complexity increase, as indicated by the results in Table I.
Finally, observed that the value of Si tends to concentrate
even more on the lower side at the deeper tree level, due to
the distribution of γi.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an algorithm that reduces the
number of multiplications and comparisons of the QRM-MLD
