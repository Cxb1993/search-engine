aia )1(9 CC   
and 2pip )(1 CC   can be established.  The advantage of using ppC  over pmC  is that the estimator of the former 
has better statistical properties than that of the latter, as the former does not involve a reciprocal transformation of the 
process mean and variance.  Lin (2006) recommended some ppC  values as capability requirements in most industry 
applications.  A process is normally called inadequate if ,00.1pp C  called capable if ,00.156.0 pp C  called 
marginally capable if ,56.044.0 pp C  called satisfactory if ,44.036.0 pp C  called excellent if 
,36.025.0 pp C  and is called super if .25.0pp C  
    It is known that process capability indices are the functions of process mean and process standard deviation.  
Several quality and statistics literatures discussed the estimations of process capability indices for assessing process 
quality based on one single sample (Kane, 1986; Chan et al., 1988; Pearn et al., 1992; Pearn et al., 2004 and Parchami 
and Mashinchi, 2007).  In practice, process information about process measurements is often derived from multiple 
samples rather than from one single sample, particularly, when a daily-based production control plan is implemented for 
monitoring process stability.  For process information came from multiple samples, particularly, came from variable 
control chart samples, Li et al. (1990) gave tables of lower confidence bounds on pC  and pkC  where the sample 
range was substituted for the population standard deviation in the definition formula.  Pearn et al. (2005) 
considered the problem of estimating and testing process precision based on X  and R  control chart and X  and 
S  control chart samples.  They provided the statistical properties of the natural estimator of pC  and implement the 
hypothesis testing procedure. 
Although X  and R  control chart is widely used in practical applications of process control (calculating sample 
range is easier than calculating sample standard deviation), X  and S  control chart is preferable to its more familiar 
counterparts, X  and R  control chart, since the range method for estimating   loses more statistical efficiency than 
that standard deviation method (Montgomery, 2005).  In this paper, we investigate the performance of the estimator of 
ppC  index based on the α-level confidence relative error when using control chart samples.  The results obtained for 
the accuracy of the measured process expected loss which is widely used in the manufacturing industry, relative to the 
control chart samples, is useful to the practitioner in determining the combination of sample size required in his 
application for its estimation good to the desired accuracy. 
 
2. Estimating Process Incapability 
 
For the case when the studied characteristic of the process is normally distributed and we have g  subsamples 
where the sample size of the ith subsample is .n   We denote this sequence of independent samples as 
}, , , ,{ 21 inii XXX   , , ,2 ,1 gi   be the characteristic value of the gnN   samples with mean   and standard 
deviation .   Assume that the process is in statistical control during the time period that the subsamples are taken.  
Consider the process is monitored using X  and S  control chart.  Then, for each subsample, let nXX gj iji  1  
and )1()(1
2    nXXS
n
j iiji  be the ith subsample mean and the ith subsample standard deviation, 
respectively.  gXX gi i 1  and gRR
g
i i 1  are the overall sample mean and the average of sample standard 
deviations, respectively.  It notes that the mean and variance of the statistic R  are respectively given as

Jahr-Schaffrath [2] introduced the process incapability index ppC  which transformed the index pmC  
to provide an uncontaminated separation between information concerning the process precision and 
the process accuracy.  The index ppC  is defined as:

If we define the first term 2* )( d  as ipC  (is called process imprecision index) and the second 
term 2* ))(( dT  as iaC  (is called process inaccuracy index), then ppC  can be rewritten as 
iaippp CCC   to provide an uncontaminated separation between information concerning process

using ppC  over pmC  is that the estimator of the former has better statistical properties than that of 
the latter, as the former does not involve a reciprocal transformation of the process mean and variance.  
Lin [6] recommended some ppC  values as capability requirements in most industry applications.  A 
process is normally called inadequate if ,00.1ppC  called capable if ,00.156.0  ppC  called 
marginally capable if ,56.044.0  ppC  called satisfactory if ,44.036.0  ppC  called 
excellent if ,36.025.0  ppC  and is called super if .25.0ppC  
    Recently, the quality and statistics literatures [3, 4, 7, 9, 12], discussed the statistical properties of 
those capability indices based on a single sample.  In practice, process information about process 
characteristics is often derived from multiple samples rather than from one single sample, particularly, 
when a daily-based production control plan is implemented for monitoring process stability.  For 
process information comes from multiple samples, Kirmani et al. [5] developed a test of hypothesis 
and a confidence bound for pC  index.  Pearn and Yang [11] considered an unbiased estimator of 
pC  index for multiple samples.  They showed that the unbiased estimator is the uniformly 
minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of pC  index, which is asymptotically efficient.  
Based on the Bayesian procedure, Wu and Pearn [13] proposed a procedure for testing capability 
index pmC  based on multiple samples.  In this paper, the accuracy of the natural estimator of 
process incapability index ppC  based on α-level confidence relative error for various combinations 
of sample size, when sample information comes from multiple samples are proposed and the process 
variance is estimated by the pooled sample variance.  This paper investigates the accuracy of the 
natural estimator of index ppC  based on α-level confidence relative error for various combinations 
of sample size.  The technique provided in this paper will be applicable when the process 
measurements are taken from control chart samples. 
 
 
2.  ESTIMATING PROCESS INCAPABILITY INDEX 
We consider the sample information comes from multiple samples of m  subgroups each of with 
4  
 
and 0.25.  The plots of probability density function of ,ˆ ppC  for other combinations of sample size 
are available from the authors.  We observe that for small N  or m  the distributions are skew and 
have large spread.  As N  or m  increases the spread decreases and so does the skewness.  We 
also observe that the estimator ppCˆ  is approximately unbiased for increasing N  or .m  
 
 
3.  ACCURACY ANALYSIS 
To evaluate the accuracy of the estimator ,ˆ ppC  we consider the measurement criteria called the 
α-level confidence relative error [8].  Pearn and Lin [8] pointed that the α-level confidence relative 
error, which is obtained from the same approach as used for finding the confidence interval, provides 
the practitioners with more direct and easily understood information than the confidence interval 
approach regarding the accuracy of their estimations and suggests a clear range on the true value of 
the process performance measure using the index .ppC   The α-level confidence relative error of 
ppCˆ  is defined as

5.  CONCLUSIONS 
Process incapability index, ,ppC  provide measures to determine the quality performance of a 
process.  In fact, ,iaippp CCC   ipC  denotes the potential relative expected loss, iaC  is the 
elative off-target squared.  In real situations where the actual value of ppC  is unknown one may 
estimate them by its corresponding sample counterparts.  Most of the results obtained regarding the 
distributional and inferential properties of estimated incapability index were based on one single 
sample.  In practice, however, process information is often derived from multiple samples rather than 
from one single sample.  In this paper, we investigated the accuracy of the estimator of ppC  based 
on theα-level confidence relative error for various combinations of sample size.  The results obtained 
for the accuracy of the estimated process incapability index which is widely used in the 
manufacturing industry, relative to the control chart samples, is useful to the practitioner in
