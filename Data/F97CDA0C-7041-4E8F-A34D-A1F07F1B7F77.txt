40-60% CO2, which could be trapped 90 and 95% (in the form of carbonate or 
bicarbonate) by washing with 1 M NaOH at a liquid/gas ratio of 100 and 200 mL/L, 
respectively. In a continuous culture, the TCL-1 strain could utilize bicarbonate as 
carbon source to produce biomass consisting of lipids and carbohydrates, which could 
be further converted to biofuels. When the nitrogen source in the influent was 
increased to 5.8 mM, the cyanobacterium could fix CO2 at a rate of 2.7 g/L/d, while 
the biomass produced from CO2 fixation could produce 44.1 KJ/L/d of heat value 
when co-combustion with coal. 
Finally, life-cycle analysis based on energy balance and CO2 emission was 
conducted by separating the entire process system into two subsystems: (1) biological 
hydrogen/methane production, and (2) biological carbon fixation using microalgae 
followed by biofuel production from the resulting microalgal biomass. The two case 
studies successfully demonstrated how the LCA be conducted, pointed out what kind 
of data are required in evaluation, and provided tentative results on how the two 
microalgae and their cultivation conditions compare to make each of them preferable 
to each other. The analyses provide the researchers of respective technologies with 
directions of further development and optimization of conditions.  The outcome of 
this work successfully shows how a zero-CO2 bioenergy process is established by 
properly integrating the subsystems of cellulosic feedstock saccharification, dark H2 
fermentation, photo-H2 fermentation, methane fermentation, and microalgal CO2 
fixation.

hydrogen producing pathways during dark fermentation processes. For example, 
Clostridial species are known as classical acid producers and usually ferment glucose 
to butyrate, acetate, CO2 and H2. The produced byproducts in the form of volatile 
fatty acid can be further converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide through 
photofermentation processes by purple nonsulfur bacteria using solar or light energy 
as the energy source. Through the combination of dark and photo fermentation 
processes, organic feedstock materials are fully converted into gaseous products of H2 
and CO2 and solid products of cellular biomass. The produced gaseous carbon 
dioxide can be further utilized by microalgae and cyanobacteria through 
photosynthesis processes to produce high carbohydrate- and lipid-containing biomass 
as additional sources for biofuels production. As for the produced cellular biomass 
during fermentation processes, all of those solid byproducts can be pretreated and 
reutilized in this breakthrough biotechnology system. It demonstrates that biomass 
feedstock is essentially converted into biohydrogen and biofuels with zero carbon 
dioxide emission. With this breakthrough bioenergy generation system, we believe 
that we can provide a dual solution to the two most critical problems encountered in 
the 21th century - global warming and energy crisis. Development of the platform 
technology resolving those two global problems requires a diversified portfolio of 
collaborators. This research team comprises both senior and junior faculty/research 
members from Departments of Life Science, Environmental Engineering, Chemical 
Engineering, and Sustainable Environment Research Center at NCKU, representing 
the goal of multidiscipline training and collaboration. In summary, the short-term goal 
of this project is to develop an efficient system to enhance cellulosic biomass 
feedstock hydrolysis during bioenergy recovery processes. The mid-term goal of this 
project is to develop a more integrated system to better recover energy from 
bio-wastes. Finally, the long-term goal is to develop a commercially viable

2.2 Cellulosic pretreatment/hydrolysis 
Biofuel production using lignocellulose by an integrated process involving 
basically three steps: pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation (Cara et al., 2007; 
Moxley et al., 2008). The final objective of both the pretreatment and hydrolysis steps 
is to break down carbohydrate polymers present in plant cell walls into 
low-molecular-weight sugar after that biofuel producing microorganisms can ferment 
them to biofuel. Pretreatment is specially targeted to improve the digestibility of the 
cellulose fraction in the hydrolysis step, by removing lignin and hemicellulose (Cara 
et al., 2007). Hydrolysis is the key step in the bioconversion process because (1) 
cellulose is the most abundant sugar polymer in lignocellulosic residues and (2) 
microorganisms performance on glucose-to-hydrogen conversion is easy relative to 
any other simple sugar. 
 
2.2.1 Physical pretreatment 
Physical pretreatment was included mechanical comminution and pyrolysis. 
The mechamical comminution of lignocellulosic materials through a combination of 
chipping, grinding, and/or milling could be applied to reduce cellulose crustaiiinity. 
Pyrolysis has also been used for the pretreatment of lignocelluloses materials. 
Cellulose rapidly decomposes to gaseous production and residual char when biomass 
is treated at temperature greater than 300oC. It found to be effective in breaking down 
cellulose crystallinity but requires more cost for power and gives all the three major 
compounds in one product streams (Cadoche and López, 1989). 
 
2.2.2 Chemical pretreatment 
     Chemical pretreatment was included ozonlysis, acid hydrolysis, alkaline 
hydrolysis, solvent extraction (Siver and Zacchi, 1995). Ozonlysis was a one way of 
 11 
and the effect of alkaline pretreatment depends on the lignin content of the materials. 
Alkali pretreatment processes utilize lower temperatures and pressures than other 
pretreatment technologies. Alkali pretreatment can be carried out at ambient 
conditions, but pretreatment times are on the order of hours or days rather than 
minutes or seconds. Compared with acid processes, alkaline processes cause less 
sugar degradation, and many of the caustic salts can be recovered and/or regenerated. 
Sodium, potassium, calcium, and ammonium hydroxides are suitable alkaline 
pretreatment agents. Of these four, sodium hydroxide has been mostly studied. 
     The enzymatic hydrolysis of lime-treated biomass is affected by structural 
features resulting from the treatment. These are the extents of acetylation, 
lignification, and crystallization. Lime pretreatment removes amorphous substances, 
which increases the crystallinity index. Chang et al. (2000) reported correlations 
between enzymatic digestibility and three structural factors: lignin content, 
crystallinity, and acetyl content. They concluded that (1) extensive delignification is 
sufficient to obtain high digestibility regardless of acetyl content and crystallinity, (2) 
delignification and deacetylation remove parallel barriers to enzymatic hydrolysis; 
and (3) crystallinity significantly affects initial hydrolysis rates but has less of an 
effect on ultimate sugar yields (Chang et al., 2000). These results indicate that an 
effective lignocellulose treatment process should remove all of the acetyl groups and 
reduce the lignin content to about 10% in the treated biomass. Therefore, alkaline 
pretreatment can play a significant role in exposing the cellulose to enzyme hydrolysis. 
Lignin removal increases enzyme effectiveness by eliminating nonproductive 
adsorption sites and by increasing access to cellulose and hemicellulose. 
 
2.2.3 Physicochemical pretreatment 
    Physicochemical pretreatment was included steam explosion, ammonia fiber 
 13 
progressing (Jørgensen et al., 2007). Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass 
to monosaccharide or other sugars is carried out by cellulase and hemicellulase 
enzyme systems that are highly specific catalysts. This group includes at least 15 
protein families and some subfamilies (Rabinovich et al., 2002). Enzymatic 
hydrolysis of cellulose consists of the cellulose adsorption onto the surface of the 
cellulose, the biodegradation of cellulose to fermentable sugars, and desorption of the 
cellulose. Enzymatic degradation of cellulose to glucose is generally accomplished by 
synergistic action of at least three major classes of enzymes: endo-glucanases, 
exo-glucanases, and β-glucosidases. These enzymes are usually called together as 
cellulases or cellulolytic enzymes. 
Efficient hydrolysis of cellulose requires a number of enzymes. According to the 
traditional enzyme classification system, the celluloytic enzymes are divided into 
three classes: (1) endo-β-1,4-glucanase, which also known as 
β-1,4-D-glucanhydrolase or carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) (E.C.3.2.1.4). The 
endo-glucanases cut at random at internal amorphous sites of the cellulose 
polysaccharide chain, generating oligosaccharides of various lengths and 
consequently new chain ends. (2) The exo-glucanase, including 1,4-β-D-glucan 
glucanohydrolases (also known as cellodextrinases) (EC 3.2.1.74) and 1,4-β-Dglucan 
cellobiohydrolases (cellobiohydrolases) (EC 3.2.1.91) which act in a processive 
manner on the reducing or non-reducing ends of cellulose polysaccharide chains, 
liberating either glucose (glucanohydrolases) or cellobiose (cellobiohydrolase) as 
major products. Exoglucanases can also act on microcrystalline cellulose, presumably 
peeling cellulose chains from the microcrystalline structure. (3) 1,4-β-D-glucosidases 
(E.C.3.2.1.21), which hydrolyze solube cellobiose and cellodextrins to glucose . 
Cellulases are distinguished from other glycoside hydrolases by their ability to

enzymes (Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008).

electron into hydrogen as intermediate. Nevertheless, in order to accumulate hydrogen 
in biohydrogen system, a screen procedure of seeding source always adopted to 
eradicate the interference of methanogens, which disrupted the syntrophic population 
(Sen et al. 2008; Skjanes et al. 2008). On the other hand, carbohydrates are believed 
-oxidation. As 
a result, many of the researches focus on the carbohydrates degradation only, and 
overlook the importance of protein for microbial propagation. All of these reasons 
make the hydrogen recovery percentage lower than that predicted in anaerobic model 
No. 1. 
Recent reports pointed out that Clostridium species were the dominant 
microorganisms in anaerobic hydrogen fermentation processes. The biochemical 
hydrogen potential (BHP) tests were conducted to investigate the metabolism and 
hydrogen production performance of various Clostridium species, including 
Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Clostridium beijerinckii 
isolated from hydrogen fermentation processes. 
The genus Clostridium was first proposed by Prazmowski in 1880. Since that 
time more than 100 bacterial species have been assigned to it. Now it represents one 
of the largest genera of the prokaryotes (Hippe, et al.). There are four criteria in order 
to be classified as a Clostridium species: (1) the ability to form endospores; (2) 
restriction to an anaerobic energy metabolism; (3) the inability to carry out a 
dissimilatory reduction of sulfate; and (4) the possession of a gram-positive cell wall, 
which may react gram-negative (Andressen, et al.). The major role of clostridia in 
nature is degradating organic material to acids, alcohol, CO2, H2, and minerals. 
 19 
Hydrogen-producing bacteria can grow in wide range of pH, however, it prefer 
neutral condition. Variation in pH can affect cell morphology, cell structure, efficiency 
of substrate degradation, synthesis of proteins, hydrogenase activity, and release of 
metabolic products from cells (metabolic pathway shifts) (Gottschalk, 1986, James 
and Ollis, 1986). Ginkel et al. (Ginkel, et al., 2001) concluded that initial pH did not 
have as profound effect on hydrogen production rate as it had on specific hydrogen 
production potential.  
    In continuous culture, C. acetobutylicum can maintain three stable metabolic 
states: (1) acidogenic (acetate and butyrate as products) when grown at neutral pH on 
glucose; (2) solventogenic (formation of acetone, butanol and ethanol) when grown at 
low pH on glucose; (3) alcohologenic (production of butanol and ethanol but not 
acetone) when grown at neutral pH under conditions of high NAD(P)H availability 
(Girbal and Soucaille, 1998). In steady-state acidogenic, solventogenic or 
alcohologenic continuous culture, the levels of mRNA or enzyme from the 
corresponding genes have been followed during metabolic shift from acidogenesis to 
solventogenesis or alcohologenesis.

2.5 Bio-fixation of CO2 
The Kyoto protocol was based on the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
especially at lowering the amount of carbon dioxide released. Technologies on the 
mitigation of carbon dioxide emission have been developed (Kawa, 1995), and CO2 
removal from a gas mixture by washing with alkaline solutions is one of the most 
widely practiced industrial gas-absorption processes (Yeh and Bai, 1999; Lin et al., 
2003; Diao et al., 2004). However, absorbed absorbents are always wasted or need to 
be regenerated (Yeh and Pennline, 2001; Bonenfant et al., 2003), thus consuming 
energy. Therefore, the path of carbon in the photosynthesis (Calvin and Benson, 
1948), a biological mechanism with sun light as its energy source, has been 
considered as a tool to fix carbon dioxide. For example, CO2 removal by the culture 
of a marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. using an improved photo-bioreactor 
employing light-diffusing optical fibers was studied (Takano et al., 1992). Based on 
the initial cell concentration of 6.76 g L
-1
 and CO2 concentration of 0.55%, an 
optimum CO2 removal rate of 4.44 g L
-1
 d
-1
 could be obtained. 
Carbon dioxide mass transfer is a key factor in cultivating photosynthetic 
microorganisms due to the low mass transfer coefficient between carbon dioxide and 
water (Eckert et al., 1967). For example, the relationship between the aeration speed 
and the CO2 increment in the Nannochloropsis sp. culture medium was not linear; the 
increment of CO2 per unit volume was reduced with the increase of aeration speed 
(Carvalho and Malcata, 2001). At higher pHs, the solubility of CO2 increases 
significantly, thus providing adequate carbon availability. Therefore, to enhance the 
performance of photosynthesis, a cyanobacterium species, isolated from hot spring, 
was used to utilize CO2 under alkaline pH conditions (pH over 12) (Hsueh et al., 
2007a). CO2 removal efficiency in the packed tower was about 5-fold higher at pH = 
12.2 compared to that without adding any sodium hydroxide (pH = 8.9). The hot

2.6 Life cycle assessment (LCA) for zero-carbon process 
Evaluation of zero-carbon process is in progress by separating the entire process 
system into two subsystems; 1) biological hydrogen production, and 2) biological 
carbon fixation using microalgae followed by biofuel production. Because biological 
hydrogen production would entail carbon dioxide (CO2) emission directly and 
indirectly, we would need to study the carbon footprints of the processes. The first 
part is expected to have a positive emission, while the second part hopefully makes it 
approach towards a break-even by absorption of the carbon dioxide, and by cutting 
down the needs of fossil fuels by the biofuels (bio-ethanol and bio-diesel) produced 
from the algae. Life cycle assessment (LCA) would clarify whether the process being 
developed can achieve zero carbon emission with foreseen technological progresses, 
if not yet done so.  
For the first subsystem, Materials and energy in an integrated biological 
hydrogen production and purification system, including hydrolysis, dark fermentation, 
photo fermentation, CO2 fixation and anaerobic digestion, are balanced by integrating 
experiments from multiple experiments, simulations, database for life cycle 
assessment and literatures. Second, greenhouse gas emission is evaluated adopting 
various options. The results were comparable with emission inventory of electricity 
from fossil fuels. NEB and NER under zero carbon emission constraint were 
discussed in detail to completely understand the implication of energy and material 
balance on greenhouse gas emissions. 
For the second subsystem, estimation of carbon footprint of the biological carbon 
dioxide fixation and biofuels production was conducted.CO2 emission rate from a 
general industrial process and choice of microalgal species, choice of cultivation 
method and its application were made as an assumption to complete an analysis from 
a life-cycle point of view.

3.1.1 Cellulase-producing bacteria and culture medium 
    Thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic Clostidium sp. TCW1 was isolated from cow 
dung (Lo et al., 2009). The Clostridium sp. TCW1 (EU916270) was grown with 
anaerobic medium using filter-paper as substrate. The thermophilic bacterium was 
cultivated at 60
o
C and 200 rpm anaerobically for 3 day to prepare the cellulosic 
enzyme. The initial pH value of medium was adjusted to 7.5. Argon gas was used to 
enhance anaerobic condition. The pure strain was pre-culture under anaerobic 
conditions on the medium consisted of  (g/l): filter paper, 5.0; NH4HCO3, 6.72; 
NaHCO3, 5.24; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2.6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4.6H2O, 0.015;

acid, 1.0. 
 
3.1.2 Biochemical hydrogen producing bacteria and culture medium 
The pure culture of C. butyricum ATCC19398 was obtained from the ATCC.  
The isolates of C. acetobutylicum M121 and C. tyrobutyricum FYa102 were obtained 
from Dr. I. C. Tseng of Department of Life Science at the National Cheng Kung 
University, while the C. beijerinckii L9 strain was provided by Dr. C. C. Huang of 
Department of Life Science at the National Chung Hsing University.  The pure 
strains of C. acetobutylicum M121 and C. tyrobutyricum FYa102 were isolated from a 
lab-scale continuous flow anaerobic hydrogen fermentor (2 l) fed with glucose and 
peptone.  These strains were identified based on 16S rDNA sequencing analysis.  
The pure culture of C. beijerinckii L9 was isolated from a pilot-scale semi-continuous 
 27 
that of Thermosynechococcus elongtus BP-1 and Synechococcus elongatus, with a 
shared identity of 99% (Hsueh et al., 2007). The Fitzgerald medium with some 
modification (Takeuchi et al., 1992) was adopted to cultivate TCL-1 in both batch and 
chemostat system. The ingredients of Fitzgerald medium are shown in Table 3.1.
 29 
3.2 Molecular and traditional microbiological tools 
3.2.1 Isolation and identification of the cellulolytic bacteria 
     The enrichment sample diluted serially in broth media was used to screen the 
best H2 production sample as an isolation strategy. Then, spread the broth over the 
same medium agar solidified by 1.5% agar and incubated in anaerobic jar (Oxoid, 
England) with anaeroGen
TM  
(Oxoid, England) in thermophilc condition. After 
several days, pick up the colony and transferred into the Hungate tube for further 
activation, then spreaded again for purification and repeated the processes for several 
times. Finally, the pure colonies were obtained from the streak plates. The pure strain 
was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Genomic DNA from the isolated 
strains were extracted by modified Miller’s Method and amplified by PCR primer 8f 
and 1492r. According to the result of sequencing the amplified 16S rRNA genes were 
compared with the similar sequences in NCBI database for identification of the pure 
strains. 
 
3.2.2 DNA extraction and PCR amplification 
     Total DNA of samples were extracted by modified Miller method (Miller et al., 
1999) and freeze-thaw (Liu et al., 1997) method. Each PCR reaction contained 1 to 50 
ng of genomic DNA with 1x buffer , 0.8 mM of dNTP, 0.5 μM of primer and 2.5U of 
DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). PCR amplification primers were 8f 
(5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) (Amann, et al., 1995) and 1492r 
(5’-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACCACTT-3’) (Kane, et al ,1993), 8f and 1512r 
(5’-GGY(T/C)TACCTTGTTACGAC-3’) (Amann, et al., 1995). PCR was performed 
in a Thermocycler (TProfessional Standard Grandient 96, Biometra, Germany) and 
the following program: a 10-min hot start at 95 ℃, followed by 20~25 cycles 
consisting of denaturation ( 60 sec at 95℃), annealing ( 60 sec at 52 ℃), extension 
 31 
1.5μM of each unlabeled primers, 5~30 fmol of purified PCR amplicons, and 2.5μl of 
premix from the SNaPshot multiplex kit (Applied Biosystems, CA). The premix 
consisted of AmpliTag polymerase, salt buffer and fluorescently labeled 
dideoxynucleotides ,ddNTP (ddNTPdROX-ddUTP, dTAMRA-ddCTP, dR110-ddGTP, 
dR6G-ddATP).The single-base extension reaction of multiple primers was conducted 
with the optimized protocol, which consisted of 20 cycles of 96℃ for 10s, 56℃ for 
30s and 72℃ for 20s in a Thermal Cycler (Biometra). After the primer extension 
reaction, the unincorporated ddNTP were digested with shrimp alkaline phosphatase 
(Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) to minimize the fluorescence 
background noise. The HOPE products analyzed by using ABI PRISM 3130 genetic 
analyzer, and subsequent data processing was performed according to the protocol 
described previously (Hong et al., 2008). After which, the optimized HOPE technique 
was application to study the population dynamics of various by inoculating the 
enrichment sample of bagasse compost and co-clutures of cellulolytic bacteria and 
saccharolytic bacteria in the hydrolysis of different carbon source. 
 
3.2.5 Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism(T-RFLP) analysis 
   The DNA from the enrichment sample was amplified by primer sets 8f and 1492r 
labeled 5-tetrachloroflurescein. PCR product was digested with MseI at 37℃ for 14 
hours, and terminated reaction for 15 mins at 75℃, finally analyzed by using ABI 
PRISM 3130 genetic analyzer. 
 
3.3 Enzyme characterization and activity assay  
3.3.1 Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrlamid gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 
Zymograhy 
Clostridium sp. TCW1 was grown in 500 ml of anaerobic medium at 60°C. Cell 
 33 
3.3.2 Enzyme activity 
Endoglucanase activity was determined by inoculating the strain (C. sp. TCW1) 
in the cellulase production medium, carrying out shaking cultivation at 60
o
C, 
subjecting the culture broth to centrifugation and analyzing the supernatant obtained. 
The hydrolytic activity of endoglucanase was measured by using CMC as the 
substrate. Endoglucanase activity was determined by incubating 1 ml of supernatant 
with 1 ml of 1 % CMC in McIlvaine’s buffer (pH 5) and incubated at 40oC for 30 min 
(Nitisinprasert and Temmes, 1991). The amount of generated reducing sugar was 
measured by the spectrophotometer at 540 nm with DNS agent as a color indicator. 
One unit of endoglucanase activity was defined by the amount of enzyme, which 
produced 1.0 μg of reducing sugar from the substrate per minute. The hydrolytic 
activity of exoglucanase was measured by using avicel as the substrate. Exoglucanase 
activity was determined by incubating 2 ml of supernatant with 1 ml of 1 % CMC in 
McIlvaine’s buffer (pH 5) and incubated at 40oC for 2 h (Nitisinprasert and Temmes, 
1991). The amount of generated reducing sugar was measured by the 
spectrophotometer at 540 nm with DNS agent as a color indicator. One unit of 
exoglucanase activity was defined by the amount of enzyme, which produced 1.0 μg 
of reducing sugar from the substrate per minute. The hydrolytic activity of xylanase 
was measured by using xylan as the substrate. xylanase activity was determined by 
incubating 1 ml of supernatant with 1 ml of 1 % xylan in McIlvaine’s buffer (pH 5) 
and incubated at 55
o
C for 10 min (Nitisinprasert and Temmes, 1991). The amount of 
generated reducing sugar was measured by the spectrophotometer at 540 nm with 
DNS agent as a color indicator. One unit of xylanase activity was defined by the 
amount of enzyme, which produced 1.0 μg of reducing sugar from the substrate per 
-glucosidase was measured by using cellobiose 
-glucosidase activity was determined by incubating 1 ml of 
 35 
according to standard methods. 
 
3.4.2 Mathematical model simulation 
In addition to biomass growth, glucose fermentation by many Clostridium species 
can result in production of a mixture of major fermentation products including acetate, 
butyrate, and ethanol.  Among these major metabolites, formation of acetate and 
butyrate accompanies with net production of hydrogen gas, whereas production of 
ethanol does not.  Equations (1) to (3) summarize the stoichiometric relations 
between glucose and products formed during clostridial fermentation.   
 
C6H12O6 → 2CH3COOH + 4H2 + 2CO2       (1) 
C6H12O6 → C3H7COOH + 2H2 + 2CO2        (2) 
C6H12O6 → 2C2H5OH + 2CO2                (3) 
 
The International Water Association (IWA) task group for mathematical modeling 
of anaerobic digestion processes developed the anaerobic digestion model No. 1 
(ADM1) to describe the stoichiometry and kinetics of reactions occurred in anaerobic 
processes.  In this study, the model structure of ADM1 was adopted and modified to 
apply in mathematical model simulations for clostridial glucose fermentation 
processes.  For model simulations, glucose consumption by Clostridium species was 
calculated directly, and the corresponding changes in biomass, acetate, butyrate, 
ethanol, and hydrogen were calculated using the stoichiometric relationships shown in 
Table 1.  For the rate of glucose consumption (rGlu), a Monod-type kinetic expression, 
incorporating the empirical lower pH inhibition, was used and can be defined as

On the other hand, napiergrass can be grown on all kinds of terrain in Taiwan and 
the abundant rainfall and sunshine make it suitable for the development of bioenergy 
technologies using natural grass as substrates. Consequently, if this waste biomass can 
be extracted as energy source, it can help to supply part of the urban energy demand 
in our country. The characteristics of napiergrass(NG) were illustrated in Figure 3.2 In 
this subproject we demonstrate a two-phase biohydrogen/methane process to recover 
hydrogen and methane through the waste biomass fermentation. This process fit to the 
integration project to achieve a zero-CO2 emission society. The most potential

DNS reagent (containing 1% (w/v) dinitrosalicylic acid, 20% Rochelle salts, 0.2% 
phenol, 0.05% Na2S, and 1% NaOH were included), and was heated to 95
o
C and kept 
at that temperature for five minutes. After cooling, the absorbance was measured 
under a wave length of 575 nm. This method is modified from Dygert (1965)(Dygert 
et al. 1965). The pH, NH4+-N, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, oil and grease, and volatile 
suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to Standard Methods(APHA 1998). 
 
3.5.2 Operation of Anaerobic fluidized bed reactor for the cultivation of 
Clostridium sp. TCW1 
The merit of AnFB was able to maintain high organic concentration by fluid 
mechanics controlling, it kept suspended solid (substrate and biomass) react for a long 
time in reactor. Fluidized bed reactor was most supported on industrial waste water 
treatment (Holst et al. 1997), but there were less studies of fluidized bed running with 
solid content substrates. This study would do the cellulose hydrolyzing and hydrogen 
production process of cellulosic feedstock. In order to promote the hydrogen 
production activity in the reactor, high organic loading was necessary(王郁萱 2008; 
林建勝 2007), however, some operating problems may occur when the solid loading 
rate increased. Recirculation pump was the power origin to sustain the solid in the 
reaction zone making the solid in fluidized condition, no axis seal centrifugal pump 
used in the first year(李澤坤 2008) was often blocked by short fibers and lipid clog. 
As a result, axis seal separation pumps were adopted to improve this block problem as 
tissue cellulose was fed into the reactor in this year. Figure 3.3 was the flowing chart 
of AnFB reactor.

time (HRT) was 15 days, was controlled pH on 6.2±0.1, temperature was on 60±0.5 
O
C. The recirculation flow rate was controlled at 35 L/min for the fluidization of 
suspended solid in the reacting zone.

3.6 Methodology for CO2 fixation 
3.6.1 Alkaline solution absorbs the CO2 emitted from the fermentation process in 
a packed tower under various inlet CO2 levels 
A packed tower was used as the chemical wet scrubber in this study. The 
rasching rings, I.D. of 5.0 mm, O.D. of 7.6 mm, and height of 8.3 mm, were arranged 
randomly in the reaction area of the packing tower. The reaction height and I.D. were 
220 and 49 mm, respectively.  
The simulated inlet gas components were 40 and 60% CO2 with hydrogen 
balanced. The inlet and outlet concentrations of CO2 within the packed tower were 
monitored by NDIR (Nondispersive Infrared). The L/G ratios were set as 50, 100 and 
200 mL L
-1
; the liquid flow rates were 150 and 188 mL min
-1
; the gas flow rates were 
0.9, 1.9 and 3 L min
-1
; and the three sets of retention time were 6, 9.6 and 19.2 
seconds in this study. 
 
3.6.2 The Chemostat system 
In chemostat, TCL-1 was cultivated in a tubular bioreactor with a diameter of 5.9 
cm and a height of 37 cm that was held at 50°C inside an incubator (HIPOINT, 
FH-130). A valve was located at the bottom of bioreactor for taking a sample for 
analysis each day. The bioreactor was aerated with N2 to prevent the accumulation of 
O2 that would otherwise inhibit the photosynthesis; the bioreactor was illuminated by 
white fluorescent lamps continuously with a light intensity of 10,000~15,000 Lux (42 
~65 W/m
2
). The influent medium, i.e., the Fitzgerald medium with some modification 
(Takeuchi et al., 1992), was adopted to cultivate TCL-1; it was pumped into the 
bioreactor by a Peristaltic pump with a rate of 1 mL min
-1
. The chemicals used in the 
cultural medium were of analytical grades. 
Sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate (from Merck) were prepared for 
 47 
methanol/chloroform 1:2 (v/v) were added to extract the crude lipid. The Insonator 
were adopted to destroy the cell membrane for 10 minutes. After destroying the cell 
membrane, the liquid and solid were separated by 3,000 g in the centrifuge (BOECO, 
U-32R). The liquid was draw by a pipette and then dropped on aluminum plates. The 
3 mL methanol/chloroform 1:2 (v/v) was added and the procedure was repeated again. 
After the plate drying, the weight of lipid on aluminum plates was determined by a 
laboratory balance. 
The method of carbohydrate determination was followed Kochert (Kochert, 
1978). The residues were collected in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. The 5 mL 1 N NaOH 
was added to the centrifuge tube and put it into a water-bath which was maintained 
100°C for 10 minutes. The solution was quantified to 20 mL by adding deionized 
water. Drawing 20 μL to Test tubes and quantified the solutions to 2 mL. The 50 μL 
phenol was added and the tubes were mixed. The 5 mL 97% sulfuric acid was added 
rapidly, and mixed. After cooling down the solution to room temperature, the optical 
density was determined by a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 35) at 485 nm. 
The calibration curve was determined by following step: 25 mg glucose was measured 
and added to the centrifuge tube. The glucose was quantified by deionized water to 50 
mL. 20 μL to 140 μL of the solution was taken and quantified to 2 mL by deionized 
water. The optical density was determined by spectrophotometer at 485 nm. 
 
3.6.4 The various dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen levels in chemostat 
To evaluate the microbial performance under a given loading in the chemostat, 
various experimental conditions for the influent medium were set, as shown in Table 
3.6. The dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen level in the influent were 
abbreviated as DICin (as CO3
-2
) and DINin (as NO3
-
), respectively. The phosphorous 
level was fixed at 0.2 mM among all experiments. The bioreactor was operated under 
-49-

reagent method (Miller, 1959). The amount of the hydrolysate includes added water, 
chemicals dissolved in water and water content in rice straw. Water consumption in 
hydrolysis is also considered (1 mol of water will be consumed to generate 1 mol of 
reducing sugar) in the material balances.  
 
3.7.4 Hydrogen production by two-stage dark and photo fermentations 
Process inventory items directly related with the reactions in dark and photo 
fermentation are obtained from experiments of the two-stage hydrogen production. 
The items that are related to operation of the reactor (i.e. mixing) was estimated from 
a reactor with similar type and size, which is 15,000 L with 15 kW (3Di Equipment 
Ltd., 2010). Difference in power consumption due to variations in reactor volume is 
adjusted by an empirical equation (equation 1) (Einsele, 1976), where (P/V)i is the 
power consumption per volume of the reactors i, and Vi is the volume of reactor i.

Based on the experiments, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of dark and photo 
fermentation is set as 12 and 96 hours, respectively. A buffer tank is needed to adjust 
the difference in HRT of two reactors. In this study, it is assumed that this buffer tank 
does not entail additional energy consumption or GHG emission. In photo 
fermentation, because of the complicated composition of the influent (i.e. the effluent 
from dark fermentation), gas production was determined by yield per gram of COD. 
Energy consumption in photo fermentation includes lighting in addition to mixing. 
Light intensity at 95 W/m

 is applied in the experiment, and the light source of 12,000

operation of anaerobic digestion. 
 
3.7.7 Indirect GHG emissions 
Minimization of direct emissions in the focal system might not result in 
minimization of system-wide net emissions. Therefore, indirect emissions from 
outside of the integrated biological hydrogen production and purification system are 
accounted for in this study. The products used in the system that are emitting GHGs in 
the cradle-to-gate of its product life cycle include: electricity, chemicals, and water.  
For electricity, the GHG emission associated with electricity generation at power 
plant is calculated using the emission factor and energy conversion efficiency for 
coal-fired electricity used in Taiwan (Taiwan power company, 2010). Emissions from 
upstream of the fuel life cycle, including resource extraction and transportation of 
coal from resource extraction site, are calculated considering conditions in Taiwan’s 
source of the coal. Emissions associated with construction of equipments are not 
accounted for due to lack of reliable data. Among various choices, electricity from 
coal-fired power plant is chosen because of its high direct GHG emission per 
electricity generated: if the system can achieve carbon neutral by using coal-fired 
electricity, then it can achieve carbon neutral by using the electricity from other power 
generation methods. The GHG emission associated with water usage is calculated 
using data provided from Taiwan Water Corporation (0.195 kg 
CO2-equiv./ton)(Taiwan Water Coperation, 2010). Emissions from wastewater 
treatment are excluded because the process systems are designed so that the COD of 
all the effluents are below standards of Taiwan. The GHG emission associated with 
chemicals usage is calculated using data from Ecoinvent Database (Ecoinvent Centre, 
2010) and GEMIS(GEMIS, 2010).

conversion rate at 30% (Hirano et al., 1997). The technologies (ex. chemicals and 
energy consumption, and GHGs emission) for producing bio-ethanol from microalgal 
carbohydrate (polysaccharide) are missing so far. To estimate the missing data for 
ethanol fermentation, sugarcane molasses (Ohara & Fukushima, 2008)- and 
switchgrass (cellulose)-derived (Pimentel & Patzek, 2005) bio-ethanol are used as 
maximum and minimum bounds. Assumption behind is that the efficiency of 
technique for production of microalgae-derived bio-ethanol could be considered as 
somewhere between that of molasses- and cellulose-derived ethanol. In addition to 
simulating the inventories of microalgae-derived bio-fuel production process, 
opportunities in enhancement of GHGs emission reduction potential is highlighted. 
Namely, a shift from lipid extraction using conventional squeezing into solvent 
extraction is evaluated.

3.8 Gas/liquid phase analysis 
The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) were analyzed by gas chromatography 
(Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity 
detector. The carrier gas was argon. The column (inner diameter= 2.159 mm; height= 
4 m) was packed with Porapak Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) (Lo et al., 
2010). The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC).  HPLC equipped with a refraction index detection 
(RID-10A, Waters, USA) was also used to detect sucrose, volatile fatty acid and 
ethanol in the filtered (0.2 mm) supernatant of culture broth during bioH2 production. 
The column used in HPLC analysis was an ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 column 
(Transgenomic, USA). The mobile phase was 0.008 N H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.4 
ml/min. The injection sample volume was 20 ml and the column temperature was 
controlled at 70
o
C. The OD values were then converted to dry cell weight 
concentration via proper calibration (Lo et al., 2010). The soluble protein was 
measured by the dry binding method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad dye reagent 
concentrate in microtiter plates. Absorbances were measured at 595 nm (i.e., OD595) 
after 20 min of incubation at room temperature (Lo et al., 2009).  
 
3.9 Scanning electron microscope 
     The culture solution was filtered by 0.2μm membrane, washed by phosphate 
buffer, and fixed in a solution of 4% glutaradehyde for 12 hours at 4℃ and washed by 
phosphate buffer again. Dehydration was carried out with a series of gradually 
increasing ethanol concentrations: 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99.8, 100. The hydrodrated 
sample was dried by using the critical point drier (HITACHI HCP-2) and then coated 
with gold by an ion sputter (HITACHI E-1010). Finally, the pretreatment sample was 
observed by SEM (FEI Quanta, Czech Republic).

4.2 Identification of cellulolytic enzymes production location 
Locations of enzyme production were an important for collection enzymes what 
we want. The locations of enzyme production were included extracellular, 
intracellular, and cell-bound. When Clostridium. sp. TCW1 cultured at temperature 
60
o
C, initial pH 7.5, and agitation rate 200 rpm in cellulase production medium, the 
enzymes were produced from filter paper (5.0 g/L) after 3 days of culture time. From 
total enzyme activity (Fig. 4.5a) and specific enzyme activity (Fig. 4.5b), the enzyme 
activity in extracellular compartment was higher than in intracellular and cell-bound. 
The maximum total enzyme activity in extracellular were 86.011 U/ml for 
endoglucanase, 5.592 U/ml for exoglucanase, 288.506 U/ml for xylanase, and 0.802 
U/ml for beta-glucosidase (Fig. 4.5a). Clostridium sp. TCW1 could produce lower 
total enzyme activity, and higher specific enzyme activity. The maximum specific 
enzyme activity in extracellular was also higher than in intracellular and cell-bound.

4.3 Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 
Zymography 
For the determination of homogeneity and molecular weight, the enzyme 
preparations and known molecular weight markers were subjected to electrophoresis 
with use of 12.0% polyacrylamide gel. When Clostridium sp. TCW1 was grown at 
60
o
C for 3 day, cell biomass was removed by centrifugation and the extracellular 
supernatant was concentrated, and by more intense and greater number of bands on 
the Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE gel as can be seen (Fig. 4.6). Lane 1 and 
Lane 2 in SDS-PAGE were marker and sample of Clostridium sp. TCW1, 
respectively. The endoglucanase (Lane 3)/exoglucanase (Lane 4)/xylanase (Lane 5)/ 
beta-glucosidase (Lane 6) zymogram activity gels were showed multiple clearing 
bands. Clostridium sp. TCW1 produced 2 wide bright clearing band, 1 finer paler 
bands in endoglucanase activity; Clostridium sp. TCW1 produced 1 wide bright 
clearing band in exoglucanase activity; Clostridium sp. TCW1 produced 2 wide bright 
clearing band in xylanase activity; Clostridium sp. TCW1 produced 1 wide bright 
clearing band in beta-glucosidase activity;. The molecular weight of these 
endoglucanase bands were estimated to be about 45, 53, 70 kDa, respectively, the 
molecular weight of exoglucanase band was estimated to be about 70 kDa, The 
molecular weight of these xylanase bands were estimated to be about 53, 60 kDa, 
respectively, The molecular weight of these beta-glucosidase band was estimated to 
be about 45 kDa, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
71 
 
endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and beta-glucosidase were produced at 
temperature range from 50
o
C to 65
o
C, and then optimal temperature was also 
controlled at 60
o
C when maximum enzyme (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, 
and beta-glucosidase) yield and enzyme production rate were produced with 
Clostridium sp. TCW1. For enzyme yield were 12029.22 U/g filter paper 
(endoglucanase), 222.56 U/g filter paper (exoglucanase), 45310.96 U/g filter paper 
(xylanase), and 164.46 U/g filter paper (beta-glucosidase) (Fig. 4.7), respectively. For 
enzyme production rate were 1.836 U/ml/h (endoglucanase), 0.033 U/ml/h 
(exoglucanase), 7.080 U/ml/h (xylanase), and 0.028 U/ml/h (beta-glucosidase) (Fig. 
4.7), respectiviely.  
73 
 
Figure 4.7 Effect of temperature on enzyme production with Clostridium sp. 
TCW1 
 
Cells of Clostridium sp. TCW1 were grown at different initial pH (5-9) (other 
condition: optimal temperature: 60
o
C, agitation rate: 0 rpm) on enzyme production 
medium amended by 5.0 g/L concentration of whatman No. 1 filter paper (sole carbon 
source) to observe the dependence of H2 production and enzyme production on 
cultivation condition.  
For enzyme production at different initial pH, Clostridium sp. TCW1 could 
produce endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and beta-glucosidase. The 
endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and glucosidase were produced at initial 
range from 6 to 8, and then optimal initial pH was also controlled at 7 when 
maximum enzyme (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and glucosidase) yield 
and enzyme production rate were produced with Clostridium sp. TCW1. For enzyme 
yield were 23772.77 U/g filter paper (endoglucanase), 511.87 U/g filter paper 
(exoglucanase), 56346.32 U/g filter paper (xylanase), and 325.01 U/g filter paper 
(beta-glucosidase) (Fig. 4.8), respectively. For enzyme production rate were 1.748 
U/ml/h (endoglucanase), 0.074 U/ml/h (exoglucanase), 9.378 U/ml/h (xylanase), and 
0.027 U/ml/h (beta-glucosidase) (Fig. 4.8), respectiviely.

Identification of optimal agitation rate is important in increasing enzyme 
production. For this purpose, cells of Clostridium sp. TCW1 were grown at different 
agitation rate (0-200 rpm) (other condition: optimal temperature: 60
o
C, initial pH: 7) 
on enzyme production medium amended by 5.0 g/L concentration of whatman No. 1 
filter paper (sole carbon source) to observe the dependence of enzyme production on 
cultivation condition.  
For enzyme production at different agitation rate, Clostridium sp. TCW1 could 
produce endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and beta-glucosidase. The 
endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and glucosidase were produced at agitation 
rate range 0 to 200 rpm, and then optimal agitation rate was also controlled at 200 
rpm when maximum enzyme (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, and 
glucosidase) yield and enzyme production rate were produced with Clostridium sp. 
TCW1. This indicates the importance and necessity of employing mechanical shaking 
to enhance mass transfer efficiency. For enzyme yield were 25018.66 U/g filter paper 
(endoglucanase), 647.72 U/g filter paper (exoglucanase), 66664.30 U/g filter paper 
(xylanase), and 684.08 U/g filter paper (beta-glucosidase) (Fig. 4.9), respectively. For 
enzyme production rate were 3.887 U/ml/h (endoglucanase), 0.143 U/ml/h 
(exoglucanase), 11.336 U/ml/h (xylanase), and 0.118 U/ml/h (beta-glucosidase) (Fig. 
4.9), respectiviely.

After several generation of incubation byα-cellulose, the enrichment sample 
from bagasse and cattle manure had a ability to hydrolyze filter paper as shown in Fig 
5.1 and Fig 5.2 . It was found that yellow affinity substance was produced in the 
hydrolysis process inoculating by cattle manure.

CDF-19 having 99% similarity close to the cellulolytic bacteria C. clariflavum with 
the relative abundance at 30.8%, and the CDF-124, CDF-138 with 99% similarity 
close to the saccharolytic bacteria C. thermosuccinogenes with the relative abundance 
at 2.1%. Moreover, the CDF-01 has 99% similarity close to the saccharolytic bacteria 
C. thermopalmarium with the relative abundance at 6.4%. The CDF-16 has 98% 
similarity close to Tepidimicrobium sp. HUT8119 and the CDF-119 has 99% 
similarity close to the bacteria Symbiobacterium sp. KA13. According to paper’s data, 
the two bacteria were not related to hydrolysis of polysaccharides. Based on the 
current classification of Clostridial clustering system, the most number was belonging 
to cluster III as 89.3% of clones were placed in this cluster. Next was cluster I (6.4% 
of total clones), and cluster XII (3.2%) and cluster XVIII (1.1%). As the result, only 
one cellulolytic bacteria C. clariflavum existed in cattle manure. It was reported that 
the new bacteria isolated from an anaerobic thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor 
treating the utilization of municipal solid wastes, which formed the yellow round 
colonies on solid agar containing cellulose or cellobiose (Shiratori et al., 2009).

5.3 Isolation, identification and characterization of cellulolytic bacteria strains. 
    According to the result of 16S rRNA clone library, the selected different carbon 
substrates were used to isolate the cellulolytic bacteria and the saccharolytic bacteria. 
In this enrichment sample of bagasse, we succeeded in isolating the dominant 
cellulolytic bacteria Clostridium cellulosi A4, and the other cellulolytic bacteria like 
Thermoanaerobactericum saccharolyticun RCA, Thermoanaerobactericum 
thermosaccharolyticum RCB by utilizing α-cellulose as substrate, and the 
saccharolytic bacteria Clostridium thermopalmarium A1 by utilizing glucose as 
substrate as shown in Table. 5.1. Because of the low relative abundance, the strains 
like Clostridum thermocellum and Clostridum stercorarium were not isolated 
successfully. Besides, Clostridium clariflavum H1 utilizing cellobiose as substrate and 
Tepidimicrobium Jia 1 utilizing xylan were isolated from cattle manure as shown in 
Table. 5.1. When the strain A4 grew on solid agar containing α-cellulose could form 
clear zone and the strain H1 grew on solid agar containing cellobiose could form 
yellow colony, as shown in Fig.5.4. 
     As shown in Tab. 5.2, substrate spectrum for these isolated strains was tested. 
Except for strain A1 unable utilize cellulose, the other five strains could utilize 
cellulose or xylan for growth and production of H2. As shown in Fig.5.5, the 
morphology of strain H1 was straight or slight curve (0.3-0.6×1.5-5μm), had 
subterminal oval spores in poor environmental condition and also likely hydrolyze 
filter paper by binding cellulosome. Moreover, the strain H1 has a strong ability to 
hydrolyze the cellulose and xylan, producing the reducing sugar, ethanol, and acetate, 
which were associated with the high enzyme activity of xylanase (7.45 ±0.73 U/mg). 
However, concentrations of the oligosaccharides and monosaccharide from cellulose 
hydrolysis were low, as shown Fig. 5.6. On the contrary, the strain RCB was in the 
morphology of  straight or slight curve (0.4-0.6×1.4-5.7μm), as shown in Fig. 5.7,

total bacterial population in primer design. One is the cluster-specific primers which 
detect clostridial cluster I, III and VII. The other one is species-specific primers which 
detect Clostridium thermobutyricum, Clostridium cellulosi, Clostridium thermocellum 
and Clostridium stercorarium. Primers are designed for different length, allowing 
them to be effectively separated and detected in capillary electrophoresis. The

substrate, 21 ml for Avicel substrate and 19 ml for cellobiose substrate. Comparing 
with other co-cultures which included ABCD, BCD and AB, the biogas production 
from filter paper was 25 ml to 27 ml, 21 ml to 25 ml for the co-culture degrading 
Avicel as carbon sources and 22 ml to 33 ml for the co-culture degrading the 
α-cellulose substrate. The same phenomenon was observed in the production of 
hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas produced by the ACD co-culture from filter paper, Avicel 
and α-cellulose was 3.75 ml, 4.2 ml and 5.7 ml, respectively. Hydrogen gas produced 
by ABCD co-culture was 6.75 ml from filter paper, 4.6 ml from Avicel and 6.6 ml 
from α-cellulose as the carbon source. Hydrogen gas production by the BCD 
co-culture was 6.25 ml from filter paper, 5 ml from Avicel and 9.9 ml from α-cellulose. 
For the AB co-culture, 6.25 ml of hydrogen gas was produced with filter paper as 
energy source, 4.2 ml gas was produced when α-cellulose as the substrate and 6.6 ml 
hydrogen gas was detected with the α-cellulose as substrate.  
     In this experiment, the HOPE technique was used to monitor the population 
dynamic of defined co-cultures during the degradation progress of cellulose substrates. 
In this study, the primers CL-I, CL-IIIb, CL-cel and CL-VII were used to determine 
relative abundance of four different defined strains in the total population represented 
by the primer 338f. As shown in Fig, 5.14, in the ABCD co-culture with different 
carbon sources, the relative abundance of SC-A1 and C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 
were decreased from a quarter to 7-9% in different substrates after 28 days. The 
dominated population was SC-A4. Relative abundance of SC-A4 was 52.4%, 56.4% 
and 57.4% in filter paper, Avicel and α-cellulose. The relative abundance of SC-RCA 
had a minute change between 23.2% and 25.8% in three different carbon sources. 
     In the ACD co-cultures with different carbon sources, the relative abundance of 
SC-A1 was decreased to 9.6 -11.1% in different substrates. The predominant 
population was SC-A4 with relative abundances at 65.7%, 62.5% and 64.3% for filter 
95 
 
became increasing in all different mixture groups and carbon sources. This suggests 
that the C. thermocellum can have a better capability for the degradation of celluloses 
but Clostridium cellulosi can have a better ecological competition.

5.5 Summary 
  So far, the cellulolytic bacteria of Clostridium species have been found widely in 
the different environments such as soil, agricultural waste, sediment, termites, 
herbivores in the rumen and feces, and anaerobic methanogentic bioreactors treating 
municipal solid waste and wastewater. Therefore, the cellulolytic bacteria had a high 
adaptation to the reactor system, and the important features included the endospore 
formation in poor environmental, obligate anaerobic growth, fermentation product 
about H2, CO2, ethanol, butanol, acetate, butyrate. Besides, a few strains had the 
cellulosome system hat can bind on surface of cellulose solid. The cellulosome  
contained multi-function cellulose, and can produce the yellow affinity substance to 
enhance cellulase hydrolyzing ability. Some evidence suggests that specific hydrolysis 
rates on model cellulosic substrates are higher for the cellulosome system of C. 
thermocellum than for the free cellulase system of Trichoderma reesi (Ding et al., 
2008). In this study, the strain H1 isolated from cattle manure also had the same 
characterization of cellulosome and YAS, too. Compared with the closely strain, it 
was similar to the one from an anaerobic thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor 
digesting municipal solid wastes (Shiratori et al., 2006), and after testing 
physiological and biochemical characteristics in 2009 (Shiratori et al., 2009), the 
strain was confirmed a new strain and named C. clariflavum. However, C. clariflavum 
could utilize cellulose and cellobiose as carbon and energy source, but not glucose, 
sucrose, xylose and arabinose. These characterizations are different from C. 
thermocellum and strain H1 that could hydrolyze cellulose, ferment extensively 
oligosaccharide and monosaccharide, as shown the Table. 5.4. Despite the strain H1 
with an advantage of wide carbon utilization, there were some disadvantages such as 
low growth yield and poor hydrogen production. In contrast, although the strain RCB 
isolated from bagasse had a poor ability to hydrolyze cellulose, the niche is good at

examined microorganisms fermented glucose to produce new biomass, with major 
SEPs including acetate and butyrate.  Production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
that accompanies the formation of acetate and butyrate is a typical metabolic path 
during the fermentative hydrogen production by clostridial species.  Once the 
glucose is depleted, the biomass growth, the product formation, and the gas 
production also cease.  The patterns of glucose fermentation for other reported 
fermentative biohydrogen tests were similar to those shown in Fig. 6.5, but differed in 
the quantities of fermentation products.   
Tables 6.1 to 6.3 summarize the yields of glucose fermentation products in 
fermentative biohydrogen tests conducted with the three cultures under different pH 
conditions.  The hydrogen yield with C. butyricum CGS2 was maximized at pH 6 
with a value of 1.77 mmol/mmol glucose, while those with C. beijerinckii L9, and C. 
tyrobutyricum FYa102 without pH control reached a maximum of 1.72 and 1.83 
mmol/mmol glucose, respectively.  At pH 4, no glucose fermentation activity was 
observed for C. butyricum CGS2 and C. beijerinckii L9, except that C. tyrobutyricum 
FYa102 was able to ferment about 50% of the fed glucose and attain a relatively low 
hydrogen yield of 0.6 mmol/mmol glucose.  Without any observed adverse effects on 
the microbial activity (such as glucose fermentation and biomass growth), the 
hydrogen yields at pH 7 with the three cultures were, however, surprisingly low 
compared to those observed under other conditions (except for pH 4).   
The calculated fractions of end-product electron-equivalent distributions (in 
percentage) in fermentative biohydrogen tests at different pH conditions are also 
summarized in Tables 2-4.  In all the experiments, except that at pH 4, biomass e
-
 
equiv ranged between 20-30%, which was higher than those reported elsewhere 
(Nandi and Sengupta, 1998; Lee et al., 2008).  The higher e
-
 equiv distributions into 
the biomass observed in this study may be attributed to the addition of peptone to the

favor the production at pH 5, 6, and uncontrolled pH used in this study, presumably 
because of insufficient ATP levels generated (Lee et al., 2008). In addition to butyrate, 
acetate with e
-
 equiv fractions of 10 to 20% was the second dominant SEP found at 
pH 5, 6, and uncontrolled pH for all three cultures examined.  The 
thermodynamically favored acetate-forming reaction is not superior to the formation 
of other SEPs, such as lactate and ethanol.  However, a net production of ATP and 
reducing equivalent needed for biomass growth, which is accompanied by the acetate 
formation, may be the main reason for the acetate accumulation at pH 5, 6, and 
uncontrolled pH.     
Compared to pH 5, 6, and uncontrolled pH, substantially decreased levels of 
butyrate and increased levels of acetate, lactate, and propionate production were 
observed at pH 7 with C. beijerinckii L9 and C. tyrobutyricum FYa102.  In the 
presence of C. butyricum CGS2, slightly reduced levels of butyrate and increased 
levels of formate and propionate were found at pH 7.  Although acetate- and 
butyrate-forming reactions were thermodynamically comparable at pH 7, it was 
difficult to fully explain, by thermodynamic analyses alone, the dramatic drop in 
butyrate yield with the use of C. beijerinckii L9 and C. tyrobutyricum FYa102.  In 
addition, thermodynamic analyses did not provide a satisfactory explanation for 
increased lactate and formate yields at pH 7, since their formation was not 
thermodynamically favored.   
The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA tends to reduce the level of Fd that 
can be used for producing NADH and/or H2.  As shown in Figure 8, the generation 
of NADH from reduced Fd is thermodynamically more favorable than the generation 
of H2, and this advantage increases with an increase in pH.  The observed hydrogen 
yields from experiments conducted at pH 5, 7, and uncontrolled pH (final pH between 
4 and 4.5) seemed to follow the thermodynamic trend, while the results obtained at

acetate, butyrate, and lactate, respectively (Zhu and Yang, 2004). Their results showed 
that the relative activity of PTA and LDH substantially increased while the level of 
PTB decreased with increasing pH from 5 to 7.  For C. beijerinckii L9 and C. 
tyrobutyricum FYa102, the substantially reduced butyrate production and increased 
acetate production observed at pH 7 may be attributed to the decreased PTB and 
increased PTA activity.  The observed high acetate and low butyrate production may 
result in an accumulation of e
- 
equiv, since the production of butyrate consumes 
NADH, while the production of acetate does not.  In order to balance the production 
and consumption of NADH, C. beijerinckii L9 and C. tyrobutyricum FYa102 
produced substantial amounts of lactate and propionate at pH 7, which prevented the 
formation of reduced Fd and led to a considerably lower H2 yield.  Despite that the 
production of H2 can consume electron equivalents, a significant decrease in 
hydrogenase II activity as pH increases from 6 to 7 (Adams and Mortenson, 1984), 
thus disfavoring the H2 formation, is also likely attributed to the considerably reduced 
H2 formation at pH 7, in addition to thermodynamic disfavor for H2 formation as pH 
increases.   
In addition to lactate and propionate, an increased formate production was 
observed at pH 7, especially with C. butyricum CGS2.  During the glucose 
fermentation, the formate production can take place via two different metabolic 
pathways, i.e., the pyruvate-formate-lyase reaction (Thauer et al., 1972) and the 
Fd-dependent CO2 reductase reaction (Jungermann et al., 1970).  Although it is not 
clear in this study which pathway contributed to the increased formate production for 
the cultures at pH 7, the formate formation would reduce the hydrogen production 
(Lee et al., 2009; Temudo et al., 2007; Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Heyndrickx et al., 
1987), presumably by decreasing the level of reduced Fd (Thauer et al., 1972; 
Jungermann et al., 1970).  
117 
 
(Jungermann et al., 1973).  Theoretically, the ratio of  HBuHAc
H
YY
Y
(2
2  should be equal 
to 1 regardless of the hydrogen production during a glucose fermentation.  When 
determining the fermentation balance of acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen using the 
ratio of  HBuHAc
H
YY
Y
(2
2  (Jungermann et al., 1973), it is assumed that e
-
 equiv generated 
from fermenting one mole of glucose for producing either 2 moles of acetate (4 moles 
of e
-
 equiv) or one mole of butyrate (2 moles of e
-
 equiv) would be entirely used for 
hydrogen production.  A  HBuHAc
H
YY
Y
(2
2  value lower than 1 indicates that the e
-
 equiv 
generated in glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation would be used not only for 
hydrogen production but also for other SEPs such as lactate, propinotae, and formate 
that would compete for the e
-
 equiv.  Combination of e
-
 equiv transfer reactions 
facilitated by enzymes such as Fd-NAD reductase, hydrogenase, and NADH-Fd 
reductase would allow this to happen (Girbal and Soucaille, 1994; Girbal and 
Soucaille, 1998; Petitdemange et al., 1976).  In contrast, a  HBuHAc
H
YY
Y
(2
2  value much 
higher than 1 suggests that different metabolisms and stoichiometries among 
hydrogen, acetate, and butyrate may be involved, although this postulation requires 
further validation. 
In our study, the calculated values of the  HBuHAc

6.3.3 Effect of HRT on fermentation end products and hydrogen production 
The soluble metabolites produced in both bioreactors at different HRT conditions are 
summarized in Tables 6.5 and 6.6.  Among these metabolites, acetate, butyrate, and 
lactate were major soluble end products found in both bioreactors.  During anaerobic 
fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose, several VFAs and alcohols are 
produced as major primary metabolites, depending on microorganisms and 
environments present in the bioreactor (Gottschalk, 1986; Andreesen et al., 1989; 
McInerney, 1988).  According to metabolic pathways and stoichiometric 
relationships proposed for anaerobic glucose fermentation, hydrogen production is 
accompanied with the production of acetate and butyrate, but not with production of 
formate, propionate, and lactate (Ljungdahl et al., 1989).  As illustrated in Fig. 6.11(a) 
and (b), hydrogen yields showed a positive correlation with acetate or butyrate yields, 
but this correlation seemed to be more obvious with butyrate as all data collected from 
both bioreactors were evaluated.  The molar ratio of YHBu to YHAc (B/A ratio) has 
been used as indicator for evaluating the efficiency of biohydrogen production (YH2) 
(Lin et al., 2007; Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Liu et al., 2010).  Fig. 6.11(c) presents the 
correlation between the YH2 and the B/A ratio observed in both bioreactors.  A 
satisfactory correlation coefficient (0.76) was obtained for the GP bioreactor, but this 
correlation was weak for the GA bioreactor (r=0.24), presumably due to an outlier 
observed (with a relatively high B/A ratio of 8.6), resulting in a low correlation 
coefficient (0.14) for all data collected.

butyrate produced according to the stoichiometric correlation, the ratio of  HBuHAc

(2

is introduced to determine the fermentation balance of acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen 
(Jungermann et al., 1973, Liu et al., 2010).  In theory, the ratio of  HBuHAc
H
YY
Y
(2

should be equal to 1 regardless of the hydrogen production during a glucose 
fermentation.  In Fig. 6.11 (d), despite that a positive correlation between hydrogen 
yield and the  HBuHAc

values lower than 1 suggest that the e
-
 equiv generated in glycolysis and pyruvate 
decarboxylation would be used not only for hydrogen production but also for other 
SEPs such as lactate, propinotae, and formate that would compete for the e
-
 equiv (Liu 
et al., 2010).  In fact, the results shown in Fig. 6.12 confirmed the robust negative 
correlation between the lactate yield (YHLa) and the hydrogen yield observed in both 
bioreactors.   
Fig. 6.13 summarizes the impacts of HRT on the B/A ratio and the lactate yield 
observed in both bioreactors.  In general, decreasing the HRT tended to decrease the 
B/A ratio but increase lactate yield.  Michel-Savin et al. (1990) evaluated the 
selectivity of butyrate production with Clostridium tyrobutyricum and demonstrated 
that the ratio of butyrate to total acids was strongly influenced by the growth state of 
the bacteria.  Their results indicate that acetate being produced along with butyrate 
when exponential growth was taking place and butyrate alone being formed when the 
growth rate was declining.  van Andel et al. (1985) grew Clostridium butyricum in a 
chemostat and observed that the B/A ratio decreased from 17.8 to 1.5 with an 
decrease in HRT from 50 to 3.5 hours.  The production of acetate at a high growth 
state can be interpreted as aimed at fulfilling the energy requirements of the cell 
(Thauer et al. 1977) since acetate production yields more ATP than butyrate 
production and is, as a consequence, better suited to meet the energy demands of rapid 
growth.  The efficiency of ATP generation can therefore be regulated through 
control of product selectivity (Meyer and Papoutsakis, 1989).  The production of 
lactate at a lower HRT, however, may involve another issue regarding the distribution 
of electron equivalents produced by glycolysis (Thauer et al. 1977).  Metabolic 
regulation of carbon and electron flow has been extensively studied with 
solventogenic C. acetobutylicum using hexoses and pentoses as the substrates (Girbal 
and Soucaille, 1998).  One of the approaches for sustained alcohol production is to

6.3.4 Effect of peptone addition on ATP production and hydrogenation 
performance  
The availability of both ATP and NADH has a significant impact on end product 
selectivity during fermentation (Meyer and Papoutsakis, 1989; Lee et al., 2008).  
Papoutsakis (1984) presented stoichiometric equations and calculations for 
fermentations of butyric-acid bacteria based on the basis of the fermentation 
biochemistry, an assumed ATP yield and biological regularities.  The ATP yield was 
estimated by using the following assumptions: (1) 2 mol ATP/mol glucose are 
synthesized in glycolysis, and (2) 1 mol ATP/mol of acetate or butyrate is produced 
from acetyl CoA.  Therefore, the total ATP production can be estimated from the 
yields of end products and their associated ATP production.  It is assumed that the 
generated ATP is mainly used for fulfilling the energy requirements of the biomass 
synthesis (Thauer et al. 1977).  In this study, a value of 2.475 
mmol-ATP/mmol-C-biomass was employed for estimating energy requirements of the 
biomass synthesis (Papoutsakis, 1984).  Finally, the ATP shortage can be calculated 
by the differences between the ATP production and the ATP consumption by cell 
synthesis.  Fig. 6.14 presents the relationship between the hydrogen yield and the 
calculated ATP shortage for both bioreactors.  For both bioreactors, the hydrogen

6.4 Summary 
   The BHP tests conducted for C. acetobutylicum M121, C. butyricum 
ATCC19398, C. tyrobutyricum FYa102, and C. beijerinckii L9 showed that clostridial 
glucose fermentation produced mainly butyrate (0.37~0.67 mmol/mmol glucose) and 
acetate (0.34~0.42 mmol/mmol glucose).  A significant amount of hydrogen evolved 
accompanied with glucose degradation and acid production.  Among the four 
cultures tested, C. beijerinckii L9 attained the highest hydrogen yield of 2.81 
mmol/mmol-glucose.  The kinetic model and estimated parameters applied in this 
study were able to accurately describe the degradation of glucose and production of 
biomass, butyrate, acetate, ethanol, and hydrogen observed in the batch tests, whereas 
the trend of product formation was considerably different for different Clostridium 
species.  The estimated kinetic parameters for different Clostridium species suggest 
that C. beijerinckii L9 was kinetically favorable in competing glucose with the other 
three strains because of its highest qG
max
 and relatively low KGlu values.  Results from 
glucose re-feeding experiments showed that C. tyrobutyricum FYa102 and C. 
beijerinckii L9 could utilize additional glucose to produce more hydrogen.  The C. 
butyricum ATCC19398 was not able to produce hydrogen once the pH decreased to 
below 4.5 although additional glucose was available, presumably due to its metabolic 
shift from acetate/butyrate to lactate/ethanol production.

7. Cellulosic bioenergy production with modified bioreactors 
7.1 Clostridium sp. TCW1 cultivation in AnFB reactor 
 From the last two years of research, though a biohydrogen fermentor can 
produce hydrogen continuously in 1.72 m

-d 
with 20 g/L Napiergrass and kitchen waste sieved liquid as feeding substrates. The 
hydrogen yield of 97 L H2/kg-COD was achieved.(陳怡傑 2009) However, the 
contribution of napiergrass was limited only with hemicelluloses/xylan degradation 
contributing little hydrogen promotion. As a result, this year a cellulolytic microbe 
was adopted as enhanced culture for cellulose degradation. In order to enhance the 
cellulolytic ability of C. sp. TCW1, tissue cellulose was used as the major organic 
carbon source in the influent. The operational parameters were listed in Table7.1. The 
hydraulic retention time was controlled at 15 days, which was long enough to make 
cellulose be hydrolyzed in the batch test. The pH and temperature were set at 6.2~7.0 
and 60
o
C respectively. Tissue cellulose was prepared as 15 g/L in the influent and 
about 1 g/L yeast extract was added for the supplement of microbial growth. The 
organic loading rate was calculated as 0.94~1.11 kg-COD/m
3
-d. Fig. 7.1 illustrated 
the biogas production in the AnFB reactor, at day 40, methane gas was observed in the 
biogas, which resulting in decrease of hydrogen content. Therefore, pH was slightly 
adjusted to 6.2 from day 50. After the pH adjustment, the methane gas content 
decreased and relative stable hydrogen content about 15% was achieved. The 
hydrogen yield was only about 0.75 mole-H2/ kg-COD. Though the hydrogen yield 
was low, high liquefaction of cellulose was achieved. Fig. 7.2 illustrated the electron 
distribution in terms of COD basis, which can elucidate that 94% electron was 
cellulose in the influent. However, in the effluent, only 2% cellulose was observed in 
the effluent. The dissolved portion in the effluent counts for 61% of influent COD. 
Nevertheless, 33% of influent COD was disappeared and may be trapped in the AnFB 
reactor. Because the feature of fluidized bed reactor was to retain suspend solid in the 
reaction zone with three-phase separator, undegraded cellulose stayed in the reactor 
for longer retention time than 15 days. Under this consequence, methanogens can 
easily accumulated in the reactor, which caused the methane production during day 
50~65.

7.2 Operation of two-phase dark fermentation biohydrogen reactor and 
anaerobic digestion for hydrogen/methane recovery 
 
7.2.1 biohydrogen reactor fed with napiergrass and kitchen waste. 
3 I-CSTR biohydrogen reactors were operated at different organic loading rate. 
The influent was Tainan city kitchen waste and napiergrass mixture with 4:1 in terms 
of COD basis. 3 different organic loading rates were chosen as 10, 15, and 20 
kg-COD/m
3
-d to investigate the role that napiergrass played in the biodegradation and 
biohydrogen process. The hydrogen production performance was shown in Fig. 7.4, 
the biogas constitution were almost the same under different organic loading rate. 
Hydrogen content is about 40~50, and under the OLR of 15 kg-COD/m
3
-d, the 
hydrogen production rate around 640 L/m
3
-d was the highest. As for hydrogen yield, 
the highest was 1.49 mmole H2/kg-CODapplied also under the OLR of 15 
kg-COD/m
3
-d. The volatile fatty acids in the influent and effluent were shown in Fig. 
7.5. It is reported that lactate was common in the kitchen waste and can be degraded 
in the biohydrogen reactor(陳怡傑 2009).

Accordingly, a series of batch test were conducted to get a wholesome understanding 
of the biohydrogen and biomethane potential of different cellulosic substrates. Rice 
straw, napiergrass, and bagasse were used as feeding substrate for BHP subsequently 
for BMP test. The experimental design was list in Table 7.4. In the BHP test, enhanced 
cellulolytic consortia were adopted as seeding from an anaerobic digester (AD) of

8. Development of a feasible technology of CO2 fixation by microalgae 
8.1 The CO2 chemical absorption which sprayed NaOH solution in a packed 
tower 
To evaluate the CO2 removal efficiency of chemical absorption via the spray of 
NaOH solution in a packed tower, various NaOH and L/G ratio levels were set. In 
addition, the CO2 and H2 contents in the flue gases emitted from dark/photo 
fermentation were ranged from 40 to 60% (v/v). Two levels of CO2 and H2, i.e., 40% 
CO2 + 60% H2 and 60% CO2 + 40% H2 were adopted as mixed-gases to simulate the 
flue gases. The mixed-gases were aerated into the packed tower from the bottom, the 
NaOH solutions were sprayed on the top of the tower.  
The results are revealed in Tables 8.1 and 8.2. As described in Table 8.1, the 
maximum CO2 removal efficiency was 58.9% as the inlet mixed-gases were 40% CO2 
+ 60% H2, the L/G ratio 50 mL/L, and the retention time 6 seconds. It suggested that 
higher retention time must be achieved as the CO2 removal efficiency expected to be 
improved.  
The improvement of obtaining higher CO2 removal efficiency can be achieved 
by enhancing the L/G ratio or the NaOH level too. Table 4 shows that the NaOH level 
should be 1 M and the L/G ratio should be greater than 100 mL/L to obtain the 
efficiency about 90% when the inlet gases were 40% CO2 + 60% H2. In addition, the 
CO2 removal efficiency would be above 95% as L/G ratio equaled to 200 mL/L and 
the NaOH concentration equaled to 1M under both 40% CO2 + 60% H2 or 60% CO2 + 
40% H2 mixed-gases.  
151 
 
8.2 The evaluation of the CO2 removal and bioenergy production for TCL-1 
For the removal of CO2 and the production of bioenergy, a isolated microalgal 
strain TCL-1 was cultivated in three sets of chemostat, i.e., enhancing DICin level, 
decreasing DINin level, and increasing DINin level.  
8.2.1 The effect of DICin level on the CO2 removal, biomass and bioenergy 
production 
To evaluate the effect of DICin level on C:N ratio and cell mass production, the 
first sets of runs in chemostat were operated under constant DINin level, i.e., 5.8 mM. 
The results are shown in Fig 8.1 and 8.2 With enhancing the DICin level under the 
continuous operation in chemostat, the cell mass production showed a great linearity 
with DICin. The R-square value of the regression was 0.96; the formula of the 
regression was that the cell mass production (mg L
-1
 d

 d

per 
increasing mM DICin. Based on the experimental data, the maximum cell mass 
production was reached to 1,055 mg L

 d
-1
. The C:N ratio in biomass increased 
dramatically from 5.23 to 6.48 while only DICin level increased from 9.4 to 28.3 mM. 
However, increasing DICin further could increase C:N ratio in the biomass slightly. 
The EA analysis of C, N, H and S contents of TCL-1 in Fig. 8.2 indicated that the 
sharply increasing of C:N ratio might be caused by the decreasing content of N. The 
biomass cultivated in the DICin levels higher than 56.6 mM with a fixed DINin level, 
i.e., 5.8 mM, maintained a fixed N content. The C and N contents ranged from 39.2 to 
44.8% and 7.17 to 8.75%, respectively. The H and S contents in TCL-1 was about 7 
and 0.6%, respectively. 
153 
 
The CO2 removal rate is an indictor of CO2 bio-fixation for TCL-1. The results in 
Fig 8.3 and 8.4 indicated that the CO2 removal rate was as high as about 80% when 
DICin level was 9.4 mM. However, the CO2 uptake rate was about 470 mg L
-1
 d
-1 
under the same level. The maximum CO2 uptake rate was about 2,800 mg L
-1
 d
-1
 (as 
DICin level = 113.2 mM).  
To evaluate the potential of TCL-1 on the production of bioenergy, the lipid and 
carbohydrate contents and calorific value for TCL-1 under various DICin levels were 
analyzed. The lipid content in TCL-1 was around 20%; however, the carbohydrate 
content increased from 6 to 19% under 9.4 to 28.3 mM DICin and maintained about 
20% under higher DICin levels. The calorific values of TCL-1 were about 2.1×10
4
 kJ 
per kg biomass.  
The productivity of lipid, carbohydrate and heat with DICin also showed great 
linearity, indicated that the bioenergy production via the increasing of DICin operation 
could be predicted by the formula. The R-square and formula for lipid, carbohydrate, 
heat, and biomass productivity, and CO2 uptake rate are shown in Table8.3.

8.2.2 The effect of the decreasing DINin level on the CO2 removal, biomass and 
bioenergy production 
Under N deficient conditions, the content of byproducts, e.g., lipid and 
carbohydrate which can be utilized as bioenergy, could be enhanced in the biomass. 
To confirm the accumulation of lipid and carbohydrate in TCL-1 under N deficient 
conditions, five levels of DINin were operated in chemostat without the reset of 
bioreactor under the DICin level 113.2 mM. In this section, the operation of DINin was 
from a higher level to a lower one, i.e., from 5.8 mM to 0.73 mM. The results are 
displayed in Fig 8.5 and 8.6. Decreasing the DINin level from 5.8 to 4.4 mM caused 
slightly increasing of cell mass productivity; however, persisting in diminishing the 
DINin level to 2.9 mM induced the cell mass productivity to a peak value, 1,500 mg 
L
-1
 d
-1
. The cell mass productivity of TCL-1 dropped as DINin level lower than 2.9 
mM.  
As the DICin : DINin ratio increased, the C:N ratio raised. It is demonstrated that 
the C:N ratio in TCL-1 increased when N was no longer sufficient. The EA analysis 
suggested that the C, H, and S contents of TCL-1 diminished apparently as the DINin 
level was lower than 2.9 mM. However, the N content dropped obviously as DINin 
decreased from the begining.

9.1 Integrated biological hydrogen production and purification system Material 
balances 
    Using the process inventories calculated as summarized in Table3.7, the material 
balance was illustrated as in Fig 9.1. Use of water and discharge of effluents from 
CO2 fixation and anaerobic digestion are significantly greater than other flows. 
Recycling of those effluents should be seriously considered to reduce the water 
footprint of operation of this system.

Figure 9.3 Breakdown of energy production (left) and consumption (right) of the 
integrated system by process 
 
9.4 Exploring different process options 
Analysis of the integrated system presented above inspired the experimental 
researchers in the team. As a result, various process options were generated. Almost 
90% of the energy consumption occurs in photo fermentation process whereas only 
around 55% of the hydrogen was produced in the same process. Furthermore, over 
70% of the product is methane from anaerobic digestion. Therefore among many, 
more attention was paid to options related to photo fermentation. Table 9.1 
summarizes the system performances of cases that adopt such options. 
Due to the COD constraint on effluents, photo fermentation and anaerobic 
digestion cannot be eliminated at the same time as long as dark fermentation is 
operated. Therefore, cases 1 and 2 are designed by eliminating photo fermentation and 
anaerobic digestion from the reference case (case 0), respectively. In case 2 the dried 
algae produced in carbon dioxide fixation is burnt and the heat value is accounted for 
as a part of the energy output. To understand how reductions in energy consumption in 
photo fermentation influence the system-wide performances, cases 3 and 4 disregard 
the electricity consumptions used for mixing and lighting, respectively. In case 5, 
hydrolysis, dark fermentation and photo fermentation processes were eliminated from 
case 0. Rice straw is burnt and the flue gas is introduced to carbon dioxide fixation. 
The algal biomass is utilized in anaerobic digestion to produce methane. This case 
helps us understanding the performance of biological hydrogen production in relation 
to that of anaerobic fermentation and carbon dioxide fixation.  
Finally in case 6, we imposed to case 0 a zero-carbon-emission (ZCE) constraint 
167 
 
constant values that convert CO2 emissions associated with electricity and material 
consumptions all the way into energy output via carbon dioxide fixation and 
anaerobic digestion. The equation elucidates that:  
1) when increase in indirect CO2 emission is due to increase in chemicals and water 
usage (i.e. denominator in the second term of right hand side increases without 
changing other terms), the system NER would always show an improvement because 
it increase methane output while it results in only very small increase in electricity 
input,  
2) when emission inventory of electricity increases, NER increases, and 
3) when increase in indirect CO2 emission is due to increase in electricity usage, NER 
decreases because the second term in the equation 5 decreases, independent to the 
value of emission inventory of electricity. 
To summarize, when a carbon dioxide fixation process that generate additional 
energy resource is used to achieve carbon neutrality, use of NEB and NER does not 
present well the energy productivity and production efficiency as it did for a more 
simple renewable energy production system.

Study on Tofu Wastewater”(and other two papers).
this conference, because it is a research outcome from close collaboration with
other groups involved in this project, therefore, the depth of the technological
insights are outstanding. Many LCA practitioners only rely on data from
interviews and questionnaires, while she really take samples from factories,
measure them by herself, and use the data in the evaluation, together with the
original data obtained in the experiments conducted by the project partners.
Therefore, it attracted a lot of attentions, and received several critical and
important comments for further studies. Most of the comments were made
regarding the incompleteness in the scope of evaluation, therefore, we wish to
make it more complete and eventually submit as a journal paper.
In the field of LCA, agricultural products and food products are attracting
attentions. However, advanced and integrated bioenergy processes such as in our
project are rarely found in other studies. There are several reasons for this,
including the difficulty of evaluation of emerging technologies. The research
of this NSC project is an interdisciplinary one, and therefore, I believe there is an
opportunity to overcome the hurdles that other research groups rarely succeed.
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略)
Other business trips were made, but supported by other project.
四、建議
It is necessary to re-organize the scope of the project, so that what it means by
“zero-carbon emission bioenergy” in the title of this project is made clearer.

六日註冊開始，二十七日開幕典禮與整天的專題報告，二十八日至三十日
的論文發表，至十月一日當地水處理廠與污水處理廠參觀結束。
此次同行的台灣學者來自台大、交大、成大、中興、嘉義大學、嘉南
科大、崑山科大、雲林科大、朝陽科大等校，約有二十五位教授與研究人
員參與。過程中我與其中幾位博士生成為熟識，包括台大的蔡宇庭、余宗
賢，雲林科大的陳堯森、張玄芳及中興大學的吳向宸等學長姐，並在與他
們討論的過程中，學習如何在發表論文時能更流暢地報告，也從他們身上
瞭解研究的路途上該如何決定自己的方向，並得到許多寶貴的經驗。
我的論文於二十九日進行發表，題目是 Evaluation of Bioenergy
Recovery Processes Treating Organic Residues from Ethanol Fermentation，內
容主要是探討利用氫發酵槽與甲烷發酵槽處理生質酒精殘渣，並回收其中
能源轉化為氫氣與甲烷；會中來自台灣與中國等學者的提問，皆能讓我有
許多的不同的想法與深刻的印象，也給了我在研究方向上更多的意見。二
十八日，學者 Kulchaya Tanong 發表了與我的論文相似的內容，唯一不同
的是反應器的設計應用，然而，在會中的討論讓我更進一步的瞭解我以往
不能解答的問題，使我獲益良多，並對自己的研究有了更大的肯定。
除了口頭發表的論文外，海報發表也是另一值得重視的部分，其中，
伊朗學者 Hanieh Aboutalebi利用Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs)進行脫
硝反應的研究最令我感興趣，在利用MECs產氫與脫硝兩者之間何者較有
價值的爭辯中，我們深入探討MECs之應用，令我大開眼界，接觸到更廣
泛的資訊。
會議中，來自台灣、中國與印度等地的學者最讓我覺得敬佩，雖然並
非來自英語系國家，然而卻勇於發問，在與會的各國學者中，最受到注目。
建議事項
永續環境與能源是近年來最受到重視的國際問題之一，這次的研討會
很感謝有嘉南科大張家源老師的組織規劃，讓台灣的學者能夠共同前往；
我相信台灣在這方面研究的重視不亞於其他國家，從同行的教授們身上也
不難發現熱忱，所以建議能建立一個組織，每當有相關會議時，便能夠扮
演策劃的角色，不僅能減少教授們勞心廢力於規劃行程，更能替台灣爭取
在國際上發聲的機會。
攜回資料名稱及內容
此次研討會尚未整理所有論文於集，故只攜回大會手冊與論文摘要集，
會場亦提供許多資料可供拿取，其中包括一本澳洲政府與民間組織共同編
輯的 ”Nutrients, Catchments and Reefs”，主要描寫Nutrients對環境的影響，
更進一步探討對大堡礁這個世界遺產的影響，內容生動豐富。
