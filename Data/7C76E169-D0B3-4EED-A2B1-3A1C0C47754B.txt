Abstract 
In this report, a timing synchronization 
algorithm is proposed for time-hopping pulse 
position modulation ultra wideband (TH-PPM- 
UWB) systems to detect the first symbol arrival 
time. The transmission signals of UWB systems 
usually utilize baseband pulses with very short 
duration to obtain extremely wide bandwidth. 
This report would present an overview of the 
principles of UWB impulse signals, and focus 
on the synchronization technique with known 
time-hopping code for the estimation of symbol 
arrival time. The system performance would be 
illustrated and investigated over AWGN and 
multipath channels. 
Keywords: UWB, timing synchronization, 
AWGN, multipath 
二、緣由與目的 
During the last decades, the prevalence of 
multimedia applications and network usage has 
grown up rapidly. The desire of new 
information and the urgent needs of broader 
bandwidth make the wireless communication 
techniques macro-improved. Hence, wireless 
communication systems which acquire high data 
transmission rate and broader bandwidth 
become the basic requirement in the next 
generation communication systems. Ultra 
wideband (UWB) systems base on ultra-short 
waveforms and UWB systems do not need to 
use carriers. As information-bearing pulses with 
ultra-short duration have UWB spectral 
occupancy. UWB radios have unique 
advantages on the radar and communications 
communities, for example: 1) ultra high 
precision ranging; 2) potentially small circuit 
size and processing power; and 3) potential for 
very high data rates in ten meters. The UWB 
systems open the door for an unprecedented 
number of bandwidth-demanding position- 
critical low-power applications in wireless 
communications, networking, radar imaging, 
and localization system. So far, the UWB 
communication technique has attracted 
considerable interest in recent years. 
UWB is based on the relation of pulse 
waveforms, which are characterized by 
fractional bandwidth greater than about 0.20- 
0.25 [1]. In a recent release of UWB emission 
masks in the United States (Federal 
Communications Commission [FCC], 2002) if 
its bandwidth at -10 dB emission points is larger 
than 500 MHz, a signal is assumed to be UWB. 
The signal consists of extremely narrow pulses, 
usually transmitted once per frame, with 
multiple frames per symbol [2]. Each symbol 
carries one information bit in binary 
transmissions. The frame duration is much 
larger than the pulse duration [3]. The UWB 
channel is resulting in a large number of 
resolvable multipath components [4-6]. Such 
resolvability offers the potential for multipath 
energy combining, which is important for 
power-limited UWB systems [7,8]. FCC

Fig. 3: Transmission signal （Bit = 1）. 
For example, the transmitting bit repeats 
five times without coding shown in Fig. 2 and 
Fig. 3. Fig. 2 shows that the transmitting bit is 0 
and Fig. 3 shows that the transmitting bit is 1. 
The pulses of Fig. 3 are later than the pulses of 
Fig. 2. This is the BPPM that the pulses' 
position corresponds the transmitting bit. 
Ignoring nonlinear distortions on the transmitted 
signal due to reflections, diffractions and 
scattering, the channel can be described by the 
following tapped-delay-line model: 
 ∑
=

L
l
ll tAth

)()( τδ           (2) 
where L  is the path number, lA  is the path 
attenuation, lτ  is the delay of path l , and 
)(⋅δ  is the Dirac delta function. Weak 
multipath components, whose power is more 
than 10 dB below that of the strongest path, are 
not counted in our channel model. We also 
assume that the multipath channel has no 
inter-frame and inter-symbol interference. 
The received signal passes through the 
transmitter and receiver antennas and 
propagation channel. After that, the received 
signal is

where )(tn  is additive white Gaussian noise 
(AWGN) with zero mean and two-sided power 
spectral density 20N . 
 Accurate TOE imposes major challenges 
to pulsed UWB systems in realizing their 
potential bit error rate (BER) performance. In a 
UWB impulse radio (IR), every symbol is 
repeatedly transmitted with a low duty cycle 
over a large number of frames with one pulse 
per frame to gather adequate symbol energy 
while maintaining low power density. Such a 
transmission structure entails a threefold TOE 
task: one is symbol-level acquisition to make 
sure the symbol starts, another is a coarse 
frame-level acquisition to identify when the first 
frame in each symbol starts and the other is a 
fine pulse-level tracking to find the location of a 
pulse within frame. 
In traditional radar and ranging 
applications, UWB signals typically propagate 
through direct-path or sparse-multipath channels. 
Tracking accuracy is critical under such 
scenarios to capture those ultra-short pulses 
arriving at the receiver with a low duty cycle. 
Fine-scale tracking of sparse-multipath channels 
faces major challenges in complexity because 
exhaustive search over thousands of fine-scale 
bins is required. A bin is combined with several 
paths. Recent efforts in the quest for fast 
tracking include a coarse bin search for 
direct-path AWGN channel. 
If we assume that the channel is a 
direct-path AWGN channel (i.e., 1=L ) and 
without any timing delay (assume that 0=lτ ). 
Therefore, the received signal in (3) can be 
rewritten as follows: 
)()()( tntsAtr l +=           (4) 
In order to calculate the error probability, the 
transmitted signal )(ts  in (1) can be 
represented as the following energy and pulse 
shape combining:

The estimation value of lτˆ  is determined when 
SLlSLJ ητ ≥)( , where SLη  is a threshold. 
The objective function )( lSLJ τ  involves a 
noise-square term that may raise the noise floor. 
To alleviate this problem, we may adopt a 
cross-correlation (CC) detector that correlates 
)(tr  with its own shift copy. The detection rule 
can be determined by

We decide the lτˆ  when CClCCJ ητ ≥)( , where 
CCη  is a threshold. Notice that )( lCCJ τ  has a 
noise-noise term, )()( sTtntn + , inside the 
integral, which causes little increase in the noise 
floor because of the independence between 
shifted noise terms. The cross-correlation based 
signal detection requires a lower threshold 
SLCC ηη < , thus resulting in a better probability 
of detection. 
In addition, we would use TH code for 
timing acquisition. Our goal is to estimate where 
the time of maximum energy is. This method is 
like bit decision. It uses the known TH code to 
estimate the time delay, but we do not know the 
bit exactly. We use binary bit to be the 
transmitted data, so we have to estimate two 
times. In the meantime, we would decide the 
estimated time that has the biggest correlation 
value, that is

timing error is obtained by 
))(),((maxargˆ 10 lll JJ
l
τττ
τ
=      (18) 
This implies that we choose the time which 
has the maximum value. We decide the lτˆ  and 
get the time error. Generally, the proposed 
scheme is the action of decision bit. We use this 
scheme to estimate the time delay which has 
maximum energy. When we can get the 
maximum energy path, the system would be 
improved. This scheme has bandwidth 
efficiency. We also do not need the additional 
circuit to do time synchronization. We just use 
the original bit decision circuit, and can get the 
more correct time error. 
The BER performance is investigated by 
simulation for the previous mentioned three 
detection schemes. The channel model is similar 
to IEEE standard UWB channel model CM1 
would be used. CM1 channel model is indoor 
multi-path environment and has 0-4 m distances. 
Figs. 4-6 show the performance with 
different synchronization schemes over the 
channel of various paths. It has better 
performance with high SNR and more paths. We 
show that the TH code scheme has better 
performance than CC and SL schemes. Because 
of the multipath diversity, we can see that the 
performance becomes better when the number 
of paths is increasing. In Fig. 4, the CC 
algorithm has bad result, because it has no 
multipath diversity. When the path is increasing, 
the BER performance is close to the theoretical 
value. 
四、計畫成果自評 
The proposed synchronization scheme has 
been developed based on the TH code technique. 
The multipath diversity helps the improvement 
of performance. When the number of paths is 
increasing, the performance is also improved. 
The computation complexity of the proposed 
method is low. Simulation results show that the 
proposed scheme has better performance than 
other two schemes. Our proposed timing 
synchronization algorithm is a semi-blind 
estimation. We use the code which is inserted in 
transmitting data, but do not need to use the data 
space. We do not need to reduce the 
transmission data rate and can also have better 
system performance.

ABSTRACT
In OFDM systems, channel estimation is a crucial considera-
tion for improving system performance. The channel fading
effects are eliminated by the equalization of received signal,
and the equalizer coefficients are determined according to
the results of channel estimation. In this paper, the chan-
nel estimation of OFDM systems in time domain for fast
fading channel is investigated and developed. The time-
domain channel estimation scheme is achieved by inserting
pseudo-noise (PN) sequences in the prefix of each OFDM
symbol, and therefore the channel impulse response can be
estimated. These proposed algorithms include both least-
squares and maximum-likelihood estimation techniques. The
proposed techniques can perform better than the conven-
tional channel estimation with correlators. Some compara-
tive simulations are given to illustrate the superior perfor-
mance of the proposed channel estimation techniques.

has been successfully applied for both digital audio broad-
casting (DAB) and digital video broadcasting (DVB) sys-
tems [1, 2] in Europe. DAB is expected to be fully launched
during 1998-2000 and has already broadcast on a trial ba-
sis in many countries. It has received much attention and
has been proposed for many other applications, including
local area networks and personal communication systems.
In addition to these radio systems, multicarrier techniques
have also been used for broadband wired application. In
wired network, OFDM, with a different name called as dis-
crete multitone (DMT), has also gained a great deal of at-
tention due to its effectiveness for high-speed transmission
on the existing telephone network [3]. OFDM transmission
technique has also been applied to wireless local area net-
works (WLAN) [4] and wireless metropolitan area networks
(WMAN). The existing standards include high performance
local area network type 2 (HIPERLAN/2) [5] in Europe
and 802.11 standard extension 802.11a in American. In the
near future, OFDM technique will also be applied to fourth-
generation (4G) communication widely.
In OFDM baseband, complex-value data symbols are mod-
ulated by a large number of tightly-grouped carrier wave-
forms. The transmitted OFDM signal is multiplexed with a
number of lower rate streams (each data stream is associated
with a given subcarrier). The main advantage of this con-
cept in a radio environment is that each of the data streams
experiences an almost flat fading channel. The modulation
and demodulation of an OFDM system can be performed
by taking advantage of the inverse discrete Fourier transform
(IDFT) operation and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
operation, respectively. Moreover, IDFT and DFT can be
achieved with low-complexity circuitry by means of the in-
verse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operation and the fast
Fourier transform (FFT) [6] operation. The inter-symbol in-
terference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) within an
OFDM symbol can be avoided completely with a small loss
of transmission energy using the concept of a cyclic prefix.
The next generation mobile communication systems are
expected to provide mobile multimedia transmission with
high quality and high data rate. However, in order to achieve
this objective, there are still various technical challenges
must be overcome in advance. For example, the deployment
of broadband wireless access systems would require a trans-
mission technique which can mitigate the detrimental effects
of the inter-symbol interference caused by the multipath fad-
ing channels. In order to enhance system performance, chan-

gains can be estimated by COR, so the initial channel infor-
mation in time domain can be obtained. Next, the system
performance can be improved by average way in frequency
domain. The main concept is that the range of frequen-
cies and its neighbor frequency components have a strong
correlation, if it is considered that the neighbor channel re-
sponses are similar. The correlation of channel is regarded
as the key point, and the coherence bandwidth is treated as
basic reference. Hence, the performance of correlator can be
enhanced by averaging method.
The average of the tap gain at index “k” is equal to the
one-third of the sum of the three terms, the prior “k − 1”,
the present “k” and the posterior “k + 1”, so the ACOR is
computed as
Hˆ

k =
Hˆk−1 + Hˆk + Hˆk+1

(8)
where Hˆk is channel response in frequency domain.
3.3 Least-squares Estimation (LS)
The channel estimation algorithm based on the method
of least-squares is proposed for the correction of channel tap
gain. The received signal in (4) with observation window
2L− 1 can be rewritten in the following matrix form:
Y = CH+W (9)

The LS estimation solution [12] of (9) is given by:
Hˆ = (CHC)−1CHY. (10)
where (·)H denotes Hermitian.
This algorithm consists of three steps. Firstly, the trans-
mitted signal xn is necessary to be determined, and the
transmitted signal xn is from the preceding symbol. There-
fore, the first time channel tap gain can be estimated by LS
estimation as follows:
Hˆ0 = (C¯
HC¯)−1C¯HY (11)
where C¯ is a (2L − 1) × L circulant matrix with the first
column denoted as [p0, . . . , pL−1, 0, . . . , 0]
T . Secondly, using
Hˆ0 to demodulate and decide the original transmitted signal
xn, and next symbol will use preceding channel estimation
result to obtain xˆn. Finally, the channel tap gains can be
estimated by LS estimation, so (10) can be rewritten as
HˆLS = (CˆHCˆ)−1CˆHY (12)

3.4 Simplified Least-squares Estimation (SLS)
In order to reduce the computational complexity of chan-
nel estimation algorithm, the effect of transmitted signal xn
can be ignored. The received signal can be rewritten in the
following:
Y = C¯H+W (13)
where C¯ is defined in (11). The LS estimation solution of
(13) is
HˆSLS = (C¯T C¯)−1C¯TY. (14)
3.5 Hybrid Least-squares Estimation (HLS)
A hybrid least-squares channel estimation algorithm based
on the method of COR and LS is proposed for the correction
of channel tap gain. The first time channel tap gain can be
estimated by correlator estimation shown in (7), so we can
get the channel tap gain HˆCOR0 , that is
HˆCOR0 =


And, using HˆCOR0 to demodulate and decide the original
transmitted signal xn. Secondly, the channel tap gains can
be estimated by LS estimation as follows:
HˆHLS = (CˆHCˆ)−1CˆHY (15)

From (21), the first tap gain “α0” can be estimated by cor-
relator. The following estimation results can be estimated
by using the previously estimated ones. For example, when
i=2, the information of “αˆ0” and “αˆ1” is used to estimate
“α2”. Therefore, the ML estimator has a better performance
than that of COR estimation.
Once the channel response has been estimated, in order
to detect the transmitted symbols, the following two steps
should be performed. By assuming
hˆ(t) =
{
αˆt, t = 0, · · ·L− 1

then Hˆk can be obtained by means of FFT{hˆ(t)}. The
transmitted signal Xk can eventually be estimated by

4. COMPARATIVE SIMULATIONS
In the performance analysis, the parameters used in sim-
ulations are based on 4MORE OFDM system. The system
parameters are described in Table 1. The profiles of two
channel models, including both 4MORE rural area (RA)
and urban area (UA) environments are given in Table 2 and
Table 3, respectively.
In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the BER performance of various es-
timation schemes under 4MORE RA are illustrated. The
LS estimator is superior to the other estimators because of
the contribution of the estimated information, and the per-
formance of conventional method “COR” is the worst of all.
The ACOR estimator gets better performance than the cor-
relator by averaging method, especially in averaging succes-
sive seven channel impulse responses. Although the perfor-
mances of HLS and LS estimators are similar, but the HLS
estimator can reduce system complexity. The SLS estimator
has also excellent performance even if its complexity is lower.
In addition, the ML estimator has better performance than
that of COR, since it can estimate the next channel tap gain
by using the previously estimated ones.
When channel environment changes faster, the perfor-
mance of SLS and LS are close to each other, shown in Fig. 5.
Because the variation of channel is vary fast, the preceding

symbol is polluted, and then, the information provided by
the preceding symbol is erroneous. In this figure, it can be
observed that the performance curves of SLS and LS are
much closer when the velocity is increasing. Thus, we can
just use the SLS estimator under faster variation environ-
ments for lower complexity.
For further comparison, the performance of BER under
4MORE UA environment is investigated in Fig. 6 to Fig. 7.
The performance is slightly degraded under UA environ-
ments due to it is more complicated with larger path number
compared to rural environment. In comparison to RA envi-
ronment, the performance of convention method “COR” is
the worst one under UA environment, and that of LS esti-
mator is still excellent. In addition, the ML estimator has
also remarkable performance, but its complexity is just close
to that of COR. The performance of LS estimator in both
RA and UA environments is the best, but those of the other
estimators have an obvious degradation at lower speed.
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, the channel estimation of OFDM system
with PN sequence insertion in time domain has been inves-
tigated and developed. The main advantage of the proposed
techniques is that they can provide more accurate channel
information to equalizer even though under higher mobile
speed. From all of the numerical simulations, we conclude
that all the proposed channel estimation techniques have ex-
cellent performance compared to conventional COR method
in the 4MORE environments, so they have the potentials
to track the channel variation, especially when the LS is
employed. If the computational complexity is also with con-
sideration, SLS should be a better choice.

ABSTRACT
With equipping multiple antennas at both transmitter and
receiver ends, the desired signals in the OFDM wireless com-
munications could be transmitted and received through mul-
tiple uncorrelated channels for achieving twofold benefits
and high flexibility. For this kind of MIMO-OFDM sys-
tems, if the assistance of channel estimation is under con-
sideration, the overall system performance is able to be fur-
ther enhanced. This paper proposed a pilot-symbol-assisted
channel estimation technique for MIMO architecture by as-
signing known pilot symbols orthogonally between different
transmitting antennas. The mixed transmitted signals could
be completely separated at the receiver end due to the or-
thogonal property of pilot blocks. Some simulation results
are given to illustrate the superior overall performance that
can be achieved by the proposed channel estimation algo-
rithm in MIMO-OFDM systems under COST 207 mobile
wireless environments.

many advantages instead of conventional single-carrier cases.
The optimal schemes of MCM techniques are orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [1, 2] transmis-
sion techniques which have widely attracted for research
and application nowadays. OFDM systems could cope with
frequency-selective fading effect caused by multipath prop-
agation delay spread through dividing available bandwidth
into many sub-bands to create a frequency-flat fading chan-
nel condition. Then, each portion of data is carried through
each subcarrier for signals transmission. Therefore, the band-
width could be saved quite a little due to orthogonally over-
lapped subcarriers. In addition, OFDM could be easily im-
plemented by manipulating fast Fourier transform (FFT)
algorithm with an acceptable cost.
Multiple man-made uncorrelated or independent wireless
propagation channels could be achieved by equipping mul-
tiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver ends with
an appropriate separation distance. The advantage of using
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) [3, 4, 5] architec-
ture is to provide more opportunities to transmit and re-
ceive replicas of same signals for ensuring high bit error rate
(BER) performance, that is, achieving high linkage qual-
ity of service (QoS). It is exactly the concept of spatial di-
versity (SD) techniques. Here, Alamouti’s space-time block
coding (STBC) [6, 7] SD criterion is utilized for combining
with OFDM schemes to construct the so-called STBC-based
wireless MIMO-OFDM systems which are expected to ob-
tain twofold benefits.
Pilot-symbol-assisted channel estimation (PSACE) tech-
niques have been successfully applied to OFDM systems for
obtaining a remarkable enhancement. In [8] and [9], they
had provided the performance comparison among various
designs of pilot assignments using different kinds of mod-
ulation schemes and interpolation techniques. For MIMO-
OFDM systems, PSACE methods based on least squares
(LS) and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) algorithms
had been investigated in [10, 11, 12]. In [10], the advan-
tages of adopting MIMO-configured structures for OFDM
had been demonstrated. In [11], the difference between zero-
form and nonzero-form pilot assignments was analyzed for
the design criterion. Another investigation for adopting dif-
ferent antenna configurations had been illustrated in [12] for
general extension cases.
In addition, the arrangement and properties of pilots for
multi-antenna structures are certainly different from that of
single-antenna cases. Therefore, some modifications must
be considered for extending PSACE techniques in MIMO-

After linear interpolation, the estimated CFR’s on all data
positions are gotten. The mixed data blocks now can be sep-
arated completely by a liner combination procedure, that is
actually for STBC decoding, after removing the part of pi-
lot symbols. Finally, the most likely results are chosen by
maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) and the QPSK de-
modulator would recover the bit streams from the detected
results.
3. CHANNEL ESTIMATION ALGORITHM
In order to utilize the advantages of PSACE techniques for
2ISO-OFDM systems, some modifications must be consid-
ered in the following: First of all, the amount of total pilot
symbols will be multiplied by the number of transmitting an-
tennas, it means that more pilots are necessary for MIMO
architecture. Secondly, pilot blocks transmitted on different
antennas must be orthogonal to each other to facilitate the
decoupling of multiple mixed data blocks by utilizing the
estimated CFR’s after STBC decoding, then the separated
symbols could be correctly detected by MLD individually to
recover the original transmitted signals. Thirdly, how to as-
sign the pilot blocks on two transmitting branches while the
inter-transmitter-antenna-interference (ITAI) between each
other could be completely avoided is also discussed in detail
here.
In this paper, comb-type pilot patterns are adopted for
channel estimation in STBC-based wireless 2ISO-OFDM sys-
tems to provide good QoS in high-speed mobile communi-
cation environments. For achieving the purpose, pilot as-
signment fashions would be adjusted to satisfy the follow-
ing criterions: The allocation of pilot symbols should be
equal-spaced and equal-powered with orthogonality prop-
erty, moreover, the minimal number of used pilot symbols
must be greater than or at least equal to the total tap num-
ber of channel models [11, 12, 13, 14]. The proper pilot as-
signment between two transmitting branches has been well
designed in Fig. 3.
The orthogonal comb-type pilot pattern on two transmit-
ting antennas is fully assigned at all OFDM symbol index
n with a repeated period 2Nr between OFDM subcarrier
index k. Two successive pilot symbols are assigned together
to form a pilot block and the spacing between blocks is dis-
tributed equally in frequency grids. Due to the unity trans-
mission power constraint, halved-power for each pilot sym-
bol in 2ISO configurations is very suitable. In addition, the
orthogonality property is indeed essential to facilitate sepa-
rating of the mixed transmitted pilot symbols from different
branches. With the assignment, the CFR’s on pilot posi-
tions of two uncorrelated wireless channels could be able to
estimate correctly.
The mathematical definition of orthogonality between pi-
lot blocks is given as follows. For instance, if the received
pilot block transmitted from branch one is operated with the
conjugate version of itself, the result will be the power sum of
these two pilot symbols which is called block power P
(β)
block.
However, the result will be always zero while pilot blocks
from different transmitting antennas are operated crosswise
to each other. The operations of pilot blocks at indices kp
and kp + 1 on the β-th antenna are presented as follows:

There are two groups of pilot assignment both can satisfy
the previous orthogonal property. They are called “nonzero”
and “zero” pilot forms [11], respectively, as well as the ma-
jor difference between them is also analyzed as follows: For
nonzero-form cases, the pilot symbols are simultaneously
transmitted from two branches during every symbol inter-
val. For zero-form cases, the specific pilot blocks are al-
ternatively sent through two transmitting antennas, that is,
antenna one is consecutively transmitting two pilots at first
block while antenna two keeps silence, and the situation will
be contrary during next block period.
Due to the alternately transmitted pilot symbols, the fash-
ion of zero-form assignment can utilize full unity power for
transmission while the ITAI terms would never be occurred.
However, less channel information of CFR’s is collected than
that of nonzero-form cases because half the chances of chan-
nel estimation are performed. In other words, the pilot spac-
ing here is enlarged equal to 4Nr and the degraded estima-
tion performance could be expected at the same time.
Although both of them can hold the orthogonality prop-
erty shown as (5) and (6), we still should not waste all the
available pilot tones for achieving superior channel estima-
tion results. On the contrary, the patterns of pilot assign-
ment without orthogonal properties are definitely unable to
be adopted. In addition, the performance resulting from
the pilot assignments which own same properties is almost
identical in spite of the setting of complex pilot values. Fi-
nally, the orthogonal nonzero-form pilot assignments will be
adopted in this paper.
After accomplishing the pilot assignments on two branches,

accelerated to 120 km/h, the BER level could still achieve
about 10−4 as SNR is in excess of 30 dB. Furthermore, the
PDR could be again increased to 1/4 for more observation
in the same channel model. As the result shown in Fig. 5,
the BER levels are all slightly improved while velocity is
under 80 km/h, especially for the situations around middle
mobile speed. However, the performance of low-speed cases
only raises little, this is due to that the PDR at 1/32 is
already enough for performing channel estimation well in 4-
path RA. Some concluding remarks are recorded: For 4-path
RA environments, the most proper amount of PDR would
be 1/32. Pilots are merely occupied a very little portion
of usable subcarriers. It implies that the estimation results
are very efficient as well as the proposed channel estimation
algorithm could perform very well.
The amount of needed pilots would be further increased
again due to that the multipath effect in 6-path TU chan-
nel environments must be heavier than that of 4-path RA
cases. The most proper PDR selection for channel estima-
tion under 6-path TU is equal to 1/4. As the PDR is fur-
ther increased, the improvement could be probably inferred
very little, however, the transmission data rate would be
significantly decreased. Hence, we really suggest that the
PDR would not be larger than 1/4 for achieving an efficient
data transmission in all kinds of channel environments. The
BER performance resulting from the proposed channel es-
timation algorithm in 6-path TU channel conditions with
1/4-PDR at different mobile speed is around over the range
of 10−4 ∼ 10−6 BER level. The results displayed in Fig. 6
are still very good.
Another comparison between Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 is illus-
trated. Under the same 1/4-PDR, BER performance in 4-
path RA and 6-path TU environments is compared as fol-
lows: Due to the multipath effect of TU is severer than that
of RA, the BER levels under RA channel conditions are all
expected better than that under TU cases at the same mo-
bile velocity. Especially, the difference is so obvious while
the speed is under 40 km/h, on the contrary, the BER levels
in RA and TU cases are both very close to 10−4 while the
speed is increased to 80 km/h.
More frequency-selective fading channel environments as
6-path BU are presented for the examination of the proposed

multipath effect than that of TU, the PDR must be highly
increased to 1/2 for achieving acceptable BER performance.
However, the performance is again more degraded around
10−4 at all speeds than the results under TU situations.
Maybe this case is a good reference for investigating the
limitation of the proposed channel estimation algorithm.
For the proposed channel estimation algorithm adopting
orthogonal comb-type pilot assignments, STBC-based wire-
less 2ISO-OFDM transceivers could be well handled in both
4-path RA and 6-path TU mobile wireless channel environ-
ments to achieve superior BER performance. The appropri-
ate number of pilot symbols for COST 207 RA, TU and BU
is suggested to be 32, 256 and 512, can the equivalent per-
centage of transmission data rate corresponding to the three
scenarios can achieve 96.875%, 75% and 50%, respectively.
The realization of PSACE techniques for MIMO-configured
schemes has been well modified as well as the simulation re-
sults have demonstrated that BER performance can be dra-
matically improved by STBC-based wireless 2ISO-OFDM
transmission systems with an acceptable cost.
