Abstract- In this project, the development and control for a switched-
reluctance motor (SRM) drive with front-end switch-mode rectifier 
(SMR) are presented. In the SMR, the DC-link voltage spikes caused 
by periodic pulse-type motor currents are eliminated using high-
frequency small capacitor. And the bulky capacitor is designed 
according to the specified double-frequency voltage ripple. Then, the 
robust voltage and current schemes are developed to yield excellent 
and robust SMR control performance. Having well-regulated and 
adjustable DC-link voltage source, the performance enhancements of 
SRM in vibration as well as current and speed dynamic responses are 
performed and evaluated. The robust current and speed control 
schemes are designed to yield improved driving performance. In 
addition to voltage boosting, the commutation advanced shift is 
applied to reduce the effects of winding inductance and back-EMF 
such that further improvements of current and speed dynamic 
responses are obtained, and the torque generating capability 
enhancement and vibration reduction are also achieved. Finally, the 
recent progress made in the power modularization and integration for 
SRM drive is explored.  
 
Key words-- switched-reluctance motor, converter, PWM, field-
weakening, commutation tuning, dynamic control, switch-mode 
rectifier, DC-link voltage control, DC-link voltage ripple, power

1. 研究動機及目的 
As generally recognized, the performances of a motor 
drive, such as torque ripple, vibration, acoustic noise, etc., are 
significantly affected by the DC-link ripple [1-6] and level [7]. 
For a motor drive drawn power from utility, a SMR can be 
                                                          
 
designed to establish its DC-link voltage with regulated control 
capability [8-10]. However, the sophisticated control for 
yielding both better input and output operating performances is 
rarely performed till now.  
Switched reluctance motor (SRM) [2] inherently possesses 
the disadvantages of having nonlinear torque and dynamic 
behavior, high torque ripple, high vibration and acoustic noise, 
etc. In vibration and acoustic noise issues [2,11,12], there are 
three converter control parameters, namely turn-on angle, turn-
off angle and winding current waveform. In addition, DC-link 
voltage ripple reduction also can yield reduced torque ripple 
and vibration. For a SMR-fed SRM, this task can be achieved 
by regulating its DC-link voltage. 
Till now, there have been many types of SMRs [13] and 
many researches [14-17] to improve their performances 
However, there still exist some key problems having not been 
totally solved till now for a SMR-fed SRM drive: (i) the SRM 
load actively draws highly fluctuated current from DC-link, 
which in turn leads to large DC-link voltage ripple; (ii) the 
effects of DC-link voltage ripple on the SRM and SMR 
operation behaviors are rarely analyzed, and the quantitative 
and robust controls for SMR-fed SRM drive are not conducted; 
and (iii) the vibration and acoustic noise reductions of a SRM 
with SMR front-end are not studied in detail. 
In this project, the modeling, design and control of a DSP-
based SRM drive with SMR front-end are studied. First, the 
SRM load model for its SMR front-end is established. Then 
the performance improvements for SRM drive by circuit and 
control are proposed. Thanks to the adjustable DC-link voltage 
provided by SMR, the DC-link voltage boosting is applicable 
to enhance the SRM driving performance in high speeds. 
Additionally, the effects of commutation advanced shift [18] 
on the SRM driving characteristics are analyzed. And it is 
applied to improve the performances of SRM in vibration 
reduction, current and speed dynamic responses and torque 
generating ability. Finally, the power integration for SRM 
converter circuit is studied.

control schemes of SRM drive are shown in Fig. 1(a). The 
current and voltage control structures of front-end SMR are

Fig. 2. Models and typical waveforms: (a) sketched di and ;dv  (b) equivalent 
SRM load model for SMR. 
 
If the current-controlled PWM with soft chopping mode is 
adopted, the typical key waveforms of di and dv  at medium 
speed of a SRM are sketched in Fig. 2(a). It can be seen that 
the DC-link current is highly fluctuated with negative peaks at 
commutation instants, and thus the DC-link voltage will be 
contaminated with high spikes in addition to the double-
frequency ripple. 
    The per-phase developed torque eiT  can be derived from the 
winding energy or coenergy )( rcW θ  as follows:

Due to the nonlinear inductance and back-EMF, the torque 
generating characteristic of a SRM is quite nonlinear to the 
current command generated from the speed loop.  
B.  Equivalent SRM Load Model for SMR 
From the above analysis and observation one can find that 
the active motor drawn current di  from the DC-link is highly 
variant in waveshapes. Basically, di  in Fig. 2(a) can be 
roughly expressed as:

with dI = average current, dsi = negative pulse type current 
strokes at commutation frequency, dhi = dominant PWM 
harmonic currents, 2di = double line frequency component. 
Due to the finite value of capacitance and non-zero 
equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the DC-link capacitor, it 
will lead to the waveforms of dv  and di  sketched in Fig. 2(a). 
By neglecting the switching frequency component, dv  can be 
approximately expressed in (6), wherein the effects and 
countermeasures of its components are indicated.

Irreducible double-frequency ripple, its effects on SMR 
control will be reduced via the proposed robust disturbance 
cancellation technique. 
 
Average value, its tracking and regulation controls are made via the 
developed robust approaches. The boosted voltage setting will be 
made to yield improved high-speed driving performance. The 
developed robust voltage regulation control is also beneficial in 
motor vibration and acoustic noise reductions. 
Accordingly, an equivalent load model is proposed in Fig. 
2(b), wherein

with dP = average DC-link power, diδ = all AC current 
components in DC-link current excluding dI . The equivalent 
load resistance is varying with motor drawn power level. For 
the nominal DC-link voltage ,400VVd = Ω= 80deR  and Ω40  
corresponding to kWPd 2=  and kW4  can be found. 
Control strategy: 
In this project, the power circuit components and the 
nominal controller parameters of the SMR are first designed 
according to a chosen nominal value of .deR  Then the effects 
of diδ  and variation of deR  on the SMR and SRM operating 
performances are handled via robust control. 
2.2 SMR ESTABLISHED DC-LINK 
A. Power Circuit 
The specifications of the single-phase boost-type SMR 
circuit shown in Fig. 1(a) are given as: /%10220 rmsac VV ±=  
;60Hz );34221.1220(400 VVVd =××≥=  Output power: kWPd 2= ; 
Efficiency: ;85.0≥η Power factor: 95.0≥PF ; Switching 
frequency: .30kHzf s =  The ramp-comparison current-
controlled PWM (RC CCPWM) scheme is employed. 
(a) Energy storage inductor 
The inductor is designed to let the SMR be operated in 
continuous conduction mode. The measured inductance of the 
designed inductor is mHLL 184.1== (at 30kHz) using 
HP4194A Impedance/ Gain-Phase Analyzer. 
(b) DC-link filtering capacitor

This capacitor is in charge of double-frequency voltage 
ripple filtering. By specifying the desired peak-to-peak double 
frequency voltage ripple )(1604.04002 Vvd =×= and neglecting

is employed to obtain the estimated ripple 'dδv . And then it is 
applied to perform the robust cancellation via modifying the 
command *dV  to 
*
1dV . Through careful derivation, one can find 
the error signal after employing robust control:

where vv WsW ≈)(  is assumed for the major ripple signals and 
dynamic response under reasonably chosen value of

cancellation can be obtained by letting 1=vW , it will lead to 
the control saturation and instability. Here 99.0=vW  is set. 
With the double-frequency ripple contaminated in vε  being 
greatly reduced, the current magnitude command *ˆLbI  
generated by VBC will become much cleaner. In Fig. 1(c), 
*ˆδ LI  is used to represent the small ripple due to non-ideal 
robust cancellation control. 
(ii) Voltage feedback controller (VBC) 
Since the voltage dynamic response of a SMR is rather 
slow (the bandwidth is normally <<120Hz), the design of 
feedback controller is emphasized on loop stability 
preservation and voltage regulation control. The DC-link SRM 
load is replaced by a resistor Ω101=dR (i.e., 
kWPVV dd 57.1,400 == ). And the step response estimation 
method [20] is applied to obtain the plant dynamic model. The 
voltage regulation control specifications are defined by the 
response parameters due to a step load power change of 
WPo 200=∆ : (i) no steady-state error; (ii) no overshoot; (iii) 
maximum voltage dip = Vvom 6=∆  ( VKv vom 0075.06 =×=′∆ );

With the addition of VRDFC, the maximum dip omv∆  and 
the effects of system parameter changes can be greatly reduced 
by a factor of ))(1( sWv−  [19]. This fact will be aware from 
the experimental results presented in latter paragraphs. 
2.3  SWITCHED-RELUCTANCE MOTOR DRIVE 
A.  Power Circuit 
In the SRM drive and its control scheme shown in Fig. 1(a), 
the SRM windings are excited by a Miller’s converter from 
SMR established DC-link voltage. The SRM employed in this 
paper is manufactured by TASC Drives Ltd., which is 4-phase 
8/6 pole with the ratings of 400V, 1500rpm, 4kW. A 
permanent-magnet synchronous generator with resistive load 
LR  is served as the dynamic load of the SRM. The DSP 
ADMC401 manufactured by Analog Devices Company is 
employed to build up the digital control environment. The RC-
CCPWM with switching frequency 10=sf kHz is employed 
for winding excitation control.  
B. Control Schemes 
The proposed SRM control scheme is shown in Fig. 1(a), 
which is realized fully digitally with the sampling intervals of 
current and speed loops be msTi 1.0=  and .5.0 msT =ω  
(a) Current loop

current controller is designed as:

The design approach presented in the previous section is also 
employed here. However, the least upper limit of P-gain PiK  
in the current loop of SRM drive is determined by letting the 
parameters in (2) to be: 0=R , 0ω =eR , == )0( oLL .14mH   
(ii) Current robust disturbance feedforward controller (CRDFC) 
A simple CRDFC shown in Fig. 1(a) is applied to yield 
better and robust winding current tracking response. The 
weight function )1/()( sWsW iii τ+= , 10 ≤≤ iW , is set with 
)3774/(1 ×=iτ , 99.0=iW . Similar to (16), the winding current 
tracking performance can also be enhanced. 
(b) Speed loop 
Configuration of the proposed SRM speed control scheme 
is shown in Fig. 3. Wherein )sec/(/0076.0 radVK =ω , )(•  and )(•δ  being the nominal value and uncertain part of )•( , 
respectively, n  denotes measurement noise. At a chosen 
operating point ( ,400VVd = ,700rpmr =ω =LR Ω95.14 ), by 
applying the step-response parameter estimation technique 
[20], the estimated dynamic model parameters are: 36.14=tK , 
026.0=J , 055.0=B , 11.2=a , 59.38=b .  
(i) Speed feedback controller (SBC) 
The feedback speed controller is set as:

which is designed at nominal case to meet the given load 
regulation control specifications [19]: (i) maximum dip due to 
a step load torque change mNTL −= 2  is rpmrm 30=∆ω ; (ii) 
restore time stre 65.0= . The designed controller parameters 
are: 78.3=ωPK , 97.18=ωIK . 
(ii) Speed robust disturbance feedforward controller (SRDFC) 
In the SRDFC shown in Fig. 3, the weighting function is 
chosen as =+= )1/()( sWsW ωωω τ ))3774/(11/(9.0 s×+ .

Hence the original tracking error has been greatly reduced.  
(iii) DC-link voltage boosting 
DC-link voltage boosting is an efficient method to reduce 
the effects of back-EMF at higher speeds. Thanks to the 
voltage adjustable capability, this task can be achieved by the 
designed SMR front-end. 
C. Field-Weakening and Vibration Reduction via Commutation 
Advanced Shifting 
Field-weakening is another effective approach to reduce the 
effect of Back-EMF, and the field-weakening of a SRM can be 
equivalently achieved via commutation advanced shift. From 
(1), one can find the winding current changing rate:

by an accelerometer being mounted on the midway of stator 
frame. One can be aware from Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) that the DC-
link voltage ripple and thus the stator vibration are greatly 
reduced by the proposed robust voltage control scheme. 
(b) DC-link voltage regulation characteristics 
Let ,400VVd =  the voltage controller of SMR be PI-
control only and the proposed control, the measured rotor 
speeds rω  and corresponding DC-link voltages dv  due to a 
step command change (1200rpm to 1500rpm, Ω= 22LR ) are 
depicted in Fig. 8. The results show that better DC-link voltage 
regulation and hence faster speed tracking response are 
obtained by the proposed SMR voltage control. 
(c) Motor winding current and speed responses 
Under ),22,1400( Ω=LR rpm the measured speed responses 
due to a step command change from rpmrpm 1500   to1400  of 
the SRM drive equipped with different configured AC/DC 
front-end converters are shown in Fig. 9(a), and the winding 
current response waveforms at steady-state ,1500( rpm  
)22Ω=LR  are compared in Fig. 9(b). The results indicate the 
facts: (i) with the higher and more stable DC-link voltage 
established by the developed SMR front-end, the faster current 
and speed response are yielded; (ii) through applying 
commutation advanced shift, the equivalent reduction of back-
EMF leads to the further improvements in winding current and 
speed dynamic responses; (iii) with higher DC-link voltage 
and field-weakening via advanced shift, the winding current 
magnitude is reduced to yield equivalently improved torque 
generating capability, i.e., better torque-per-ampere 
characteristic. 
The measured rotor speeds rω  of the SMR-fed SRM drive 
at VVd 400=  due to a step command change from 1400rpm to 
1500rpm ( Ω= 42LR  and Ω= 22LR ) by the PI and the 
proposed speed controllers are compared in Fig.10(a), wherein 
the reference speed response *rmω  is also shown. Due to the 
proposed SRDFC, the closer and robust model following 
responses are obtained. At ( Ω== 42 rpm,1500 Lr Rω ),  the 
measured speeds due to a step load resistance change 
ΩΩ= 22   to42LR  by PI and the proposed speed controls are 
shown in Fig. 10(b). One can observe that less speed dip and 
faster restore response are yielded by the proposed control.
