In order to provide quality delivery to delay-sensitive applications such as voice and video in the 
next generation wireless networks, it is imperative that mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have 
to support quality-of-service (QoS) so that bandwidth and delay requirements can be guaranteed. 
Thus far, providing QoS in MANETs is still a challenge, because dynamic topology and shared 
wireless medium should be taken into account, in addition to QoS constraints. They will bring 
about the following problems to be resolved.  
(P1) An estimation method that can calculate the available bandwidth in a shared wireless 
channel environment and the end-to-end delay in an unsynchronized environment, accurately. 
(P2) A distributed routing algorithm that can adapt to dynamic environments. 
(P3) A resource reservation mechanism that can guarantee required resources. 
(P4) An efficient and effective route recovery method. 
The objective of this project is to develop MAC layer and network layer protocols that can 
support QoS transmissions in MANETs. For the MAC layer, some tasks need to be performed. 
The first task is to develop an analytical model that can estimate the available bandwidth and 
end-to-end delay for CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance). 
Accurate estimation of available bandwidth is a trivial task in wired networks because the 
underlying medium is a dedicated point-to- point link with fixed capability.  
However, it becomes rather difficult in wireless networks even if the MANETs are static. This is 
because the radio channel of each node is shared with all its neighbors. We shall further 
6前言 
An ad hoc network is formed by a collection of mobile nodes without any centralized access 
point or existing infrastructure. Communications between mobile nodes require routing over 
multiple-hop wireless paths. Since mobile nodes could be of high mobility, an effective and 
adaptive routing protocol must have ongoing details of the topology information. However, it 
wastes limited bandwidth to keep routing information up-to-date and reliable. Thus, one of 
crucial design objectives to achieve routing responsiveness and updating efficiency is the 
minimization of reaction to mobility. Specifically, a scalable and QoS guaranteed routing protocol 
is desired for novel multimedia applications in mobile ad hoc networks. 
In this paper, we propose an efficiently repairable routing protocol, called gravitational cluster 
routing (GCR) protocol. It contains a stable cluster structure to cover dense areas and avoid 
articulation nodes. The reaction to mobility can be reduced significantly by unicast. Active 
routing paths can be maintained locally in each cluster. Besides, repairable levels of active 
routing paths, which rank their stabilities, are evaluated. By their aid, the proposed GCR can find 
routing paths that satisfy different parameters of QoS. These mechanisms can improve the 
stability of active connections. 
研究目的 
In recent years, the rapid growth of wireless communications has offered various services 
and conveniences to many people. Plenty of these modern services could be relied on fixed 
networks as their backbones. However, there are several applications such as disaster rescues, 
tactical communications for military usages, and wireless conferences for large-scale meetings, in 
which a fixed communication infrastructure is hard to establish. Instead, an ad hoc network can 
serve for these situations. An ad hoc network is cooperated by a collection of mobile nodes 
without any centralized access point or existing infrastructure.  
Communications in an ad hoc network require routing over multiple-hop wireless paths due 
to the restricted range of wireless transmission. Different from traditional wired networks, link 
failures may occur more frequently in an ad hoc network as a consequence of mobililty. This 
causes the need of an effective and adaptive routing protocol. Furthermore, the progress in 
electronic integration and wireless communication has greatly reduced cost, size and power 
requirement of mobile computing devices. Large-scale and dense wireless mobile networks such 
as wireless sensor networks are expected to find a variety of applications. Therefore, a novel 
scalable and QoS guaranteed routing protocol is necessary for multimedia applications in such 
wireless networks. 
Many routing protocols have been developed for ad hoc networks. The evolution of routing 
protocols contains three stages. In the first stage, wireless-oriented routing protocols are desired, 
because traditional routing protocols for wired networks such as distance Bellman-ford [1] or link 
state [2] are not suitable for wireless and mobile environment. Many table-driven and on- demand 
8cover dense areas to increase stability, and avoid articulation nodes [24] in the cluster to assure 
robust connection.  
Previous hierarchical routing protocols change their hierarchical structures to react any 
topology changes by locally broadcasting even though some topology changes might not alter the 
hierarchical structures. Instead, GCR utilizes unicast to minimize reaction to mobility. Although 
the cluster scheme of GCR can reduce the maintenance cost, it may result in higher mobility of 
clusters at the same time. Hence, the concept of repairable level is introduced. GCR quantifies the 
repairable level of a route and selects routes with proper repariable levels to satisfy different 
demands of end-to-end perceived quality of the application specifically. 
In the simulation experiments, we demonstrate that GCR is an efficient and inexpensive 
routing protocol and is more suitable for large-scale and dense ad hoc networks than the zone 
routing protocol [21]. The proposed GCR protocol carries the following advantages. 
 Providing end-to-end perceived QoS guarantee.  
 Constructing a QoS aware cluster backbone to support upper layer protocols. 
 Suitable for large-scale and dense ad hoc networks. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes some related 
assumptions of link protocol. Section 3 describes the GCR protocol in detail. Section 4 provides 
some numerical analyses and simulation results. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper with 
some future works.. 
文獻探討 
In a MANET, nodes may move, join, or leave at any time and any location. Existing wireless links 
may disappear and new wireless links may be formed. In consequence of dynamic topology, QoS 
routing protocols are responsible for maintaining QoS routes. However, the expected number of 
hops in each route approaches O(n1/2), where n is the number of nodes in the MANET. 
Performing route maintenance in large-scale MANETs is difficult for a flat QoS routing protocol 
due to the long path length. Instead, hierarchical QoS routing protocols which provide routes 
passing through stable backbones are more appropriate for providing reliable data transmission. 
In this chapter, a stable two-tier infrastructure, named Gravitational Cluster (GC), for the 
purpose of fast route recovery is introduced. In order to increase the stability of each GC, the 
construction of each GC is to cover dense areas and avoid articulation nodes [79]. Beside, in 
order to reduce the maintenance cost of each GC, no duplicate topology information is 
maintained in each GC. With the help of GC, active routes can be maintained locally and 
efficiently in each passing GC. Finally, a stability- aware QoS routing protocol, named GC-based 
QoS Routing (GCQR) protocol, is proposed. GCQR quantifies the repairable degrees of routes to 
rank their stabilities, and selects routes with proper repariable degrees. It can improve the 
end-to-end perceived quality of applications by increasing the stability of active connections. In 
the simulation experiments, we demonstrate that GCQR is an efficient and inexpensive QoS 
routing protocol and is more suitable for large-scale and dense MANETs than the zone routing 
protocol [25].  
be the cluster head. Each node in the MANET is dominated by a cluster head. Moreover, each 
node is associated with a unique identifier, denoted by ID. For a node u, we use N(u) to denote 
the set of neighboring nodes of u, i.e., those nodes located in the transmitting range of u. Each 
node maintains a table, called Link Information Table (refer to Figure 4.1) to record some state 
information of its neighboring nodes. Link Information Tables can be updated by Beacons (refer 
to Figure 4.2) which are signals periodically broadcast by each node. The following notations are 
necessary when we describe the details of the GC structures in the rest of this section. 
• deg(u): the size of N(u).  
• Cid(u): the ID of the cluster head that dominates u.  
• STid(u): the ID of the node that is neighboring to Cid(u) and lies on the shortest path p(u) 
(p(u) will be defined in Section 4.1.3). 
• l(u): the minimum hop count from u to its cluster head. 
Recall that two crucial design objectives of GC structures are to minimize the reaction to 
topology changes and increase the stability of GCs. In order to minimize the reaction to topology 
changes, no duplicate topology information is maintained in each GC. The structure of a GC is 
designed as a gravitational area. Each node u only knows its potential (i.e., l(u)) of the 
gravitational area, and only cluster heads maintain the up-to-date topology of their clusters. GCs 
can reduce the number of control packets for cluster maintenance. On the other hand, in order to 
increase the stability of GCs, the construction of each GC is to avoid articulation nodes inside GC. 
Moreover, nodes that have “local maximum degree” [84] are elected as cluster heads and initiate 
the GC_Construction_Procedure (see Section 4.1.2) to construct clusters. The construted GCs 
have stronger connectivity because they cover the dense areas of the MANET. The active routes 
can be repaired efficiently in the dense areas because relaying nodes of routing paths can always 
bypass link failures in their neighborhood. The relation between above strategies and their 
advantages are shown in Figure 4.3.

GC Head Election 
When the Cid(u) of a node u is null, and for all v∈N(u), the ClusterId field in node v’s entry of 
the link information table maintained by u (“ClusterId of v“ for short) is null over a particular 
periodic time, node u broadcasts degree information deg(u) to all of its neighboring nodes. When 
a node v receives deg(u), it updates the Degree field in node u’s entry of the link information 
table maintained by v (“Degree of u“ for short) and will further broadcast deg(v) to all of its 
neighboring nodes if Cid(v) is null. If a node u whose deg(u) is greater than the Degree of v for 
all v∈N(u), u is elected as a cluster head and then initiates the GC_Construction_Procedure.

In the second part, each node that has received the gravitation packet decides if it is jointless 
or not. A node u is jointless if STid(v) is not equal to STid(w), for some v, w ∈ N(u) and 
Cid(v)=Cid(w)=Cid(u). Otherwise u is not jointless. Moreover, a node u is a leaf node, if l(u)≥l(v) 
for all v ∈ N(u), Cid(v)=Cid(u) and v has not been admitted to join the cluster. If a leaf node u is 
jointless, it joins the cluster and sends the join packet which includes the link information table 
maintained by u through path p(u) to the cluster head. Otherwise, u gives up joining the cluster, 
and assigns l(u)=0, Cid(u)=null, and STid(u)=null. A node v is called the up-level neighboring 
node of u if l(v)=l(u)−1 and v ∈ N(u). When a node u gives up to join a cluster, some up-level 
neighboring nodes of u may become leaf nodes and continuously decide to join the cluster or not.  
Figure 4.3. The relation between strategies of GC and their advantages. 
When a node u receives the join packet, it can join the cluster. The node appends its link 
information table to the join packet and forward this join packet to its up-level neighboring node 
lied on p(u). Similar procedures will be triggered until the cluster head receives join packets. So, 
the cluster head knows the topology of the cluster and each cluster member knows its potential of 
the gravitational area after the GC_Construction_ Procedure is performed. Figure 4.6 to 4.9 show 
an example for the construction of GCs. We prove that GCs can tolerate one node failure unless 
the faulty node is GC head in the following theorem.

GC Maintenance 
In a MANET, the network topology is changed frequently by some events among mobile nodes, 
such as the mobility and switching. In order to reduce the cost of cluster maintenance, the 
frequent change of cluster structures to react the change of network topology is not necessary. So 
all GCs does not maintain the fault tolerance feature of clusters expressly in 
GC_Maintenance_Procedure (refer to Figure 4.11). It only guarantees that all nodes in the 
MANET are stable. A node u is stable if u is dominated by a cluster head, and there is a node w 
neighboring to u with Cid(w) = Cid(u) and l(w) = l(u)−1. In GC_Maintenance_Procedure, it also

does not take extra maintenance cost to handle the cluster head failure. It takes some strategies to

non-overlapping GCs. The GC head maintains the topology of the GC and the link in
between itself and its neighboring GCs. Other nodes do not maintain any routing table. Based on
the GC structure, a stability-aware QoS routing protocol, named GCQR, is proposed as follows. 
When a node tends to communicate with other nodes in a MANET, it will send route request 
packet (RREQ) to the up-level neighboring node and the RREQ packet will be forwarded to th
cluster head step by step. When the cluster head receives the RREQ packet, it will broadcast the 
RREQ packet in super node (cluster) level. The inter-cluster communication can be described as 
follows. First a cluster head transmits packets to its border nodes by unicast. Second the 
particular border node of another cluster receives the packets and then forwards them to i
cluster head according to the potential of each node step by step. After the cluster head that 
dominates the destination node receiving the RREQ, it will reply route reply packet (RREP)
the source node and the route from source to destination is constructed. 
When two mobile nodes communicate to each other, we denote pas
stination as C1, C2, …, Ct, and two border node sets of Ci which are connected with Ci-1 
(upstream cluster) and Ci+1 (downstream cluster) as Uci and Dci. If the communication is 
disconnected due to node moving, the Route_Maintenance_ Procedure can be described in
cases. In the first case, the disconnection is due to a inter-cluster link between Ci and Ci+1 failure
If there are other inter-cluster links between Ci and Ci+1, the cluster head of Ci will reconstruct the 
path through them. Else, each cluster can be regarded as a super node and the strategy of 
reconstruction is similar to AODV [9]. In the second case, the disconnection is due to a 
intra-cluster link of Ci failure. According to the description of Section 4.1.4, the GC_ 
Maintenance_Procedure will be executed. After the intra-cluster link failure, if the Ci-
are also neighbors of Ci , the path is maintained automatically. Else, the strategy of reconstruction
is similar to AODV in super node level. 
The GC structure has high stability 
bone for QoS routing. Routing paths that are formed by above may not be shortest path
GCQR can reduce the length of them with partial optimization inside clusters. Since the cluster 
head maintains the topology of the cluster, GCQR can optimize the intra-cluster paths from Uci t
Dci by any known shortest path algorithm. Furthermore, GCQR quantifies the repairable degrees 
of routes to rank their stabilities, and selects routes with proper repariable degrees. It can improve 
the end-to-end perceived quality of applications by increasing the stability of active connections.

The GCR Protocol 
The goal of this approach is to construct a quickly repairable routing path with light cost in 
maintenance. In order to achieve this goal, we divide the network into several non-overlapping 
clusters. Proactive routing protocol has been adopted inside the clusters and reactive routing 
protocol outside the clusters. When two mobile nodes communicate to each other, the routing 
path connecting these two mobile nodes may be through several intermediate clusters. Therefore, 
maintenance efforts of the entire routing path can be distributed into these intermediate clusters. 
The proposed GCR avoids articulation nodes in clusters on the cluster construction phase to 
reduce clustering maintenance cost and connect strongly. Nodes that have “local maximum 
degree” are elected to be cluster heads and initiate the Cluster Construction Procedure to 
construct clusters. Those constructed clusters are stable since they cover the dense area of the 
network. Besides, the cluster structure is designed as a gravitational area. It can reduce the 
number of control packets which are broadcast locally for cluster maintenance. Each node of 
cluster knows its potential of the gravitational area, and only the cluster head maintains the 
topological status of its cluster. The active connection can be repaired efficiently and locally by 
light maintenance cost and stable clusters. In order to achieve global repair efficiently, GCR 
quantifies the repairable level of a route. By its aid, GCR can find a route passing through 
clusters that have stronger connectivity between each other to overcome the high mobility of 
clusters. The relation between above strategies and their advantages are in Figure 3. 
3.1. Cluster head selection 
When the ClusterId of a node u is null and the ClusterId of a node v is null for all v　N(u) over a 
particular periodic time, node u broadcasts degree information deg(u) to all its neighboring nodes. 
When node v receives deg(u), it will further broadcast deg(v) to all its neighboring nodes 
provided Cid(v) is null. Similar procedure will be triggered until all nodes broadcast their degree 
information once. After this procedure, nodes whose degree are greater than all their neighbors 
will be cluster heads. The detailed procedure is as follows.

node w whose l(w) is equal to l(u)-1 and these two nodes are in the same cluster. The node w is

3.3. Cluster Maintenance 
In an ad hoc network, the network topology is changed frequently by some events among mobile 
nodes, such as the mobility and switching. In order to reduce the cost of cluster maintenance, the

change packet to notify the cluster head. Node v will change l(v) to l(u) plus one if l(v) is greater 
than l(u) plus one. Similarly this change may propagate until all nodes of the cluster are stable. As 
a new node switches on, it will wait a chance to join a most suitable cluster or initiate to construct 
a new cluster. The most suitable cluster can be determined according to the level that will be 
obtained from this joining node and the connectivity between this node and this cluster. 
THEOREM 2. The ratio of influential links to total links is at most “2/Average Degree”. 
Proof. Node u updates its l(u) only if it has no neighbors in l(u)-1 level. Therefore, we consider 
that tree T(C) is a spanning tree of cluster C defined as before. Links of T(C) are called tree links 
and other links of C are called non-tree links. If a non-tree link (u,v) is failure and l(u) is greater 
than l(v), node u would not update its l(u) because there is a tree link (u,v’) and l(v’) is l(u)-1. 
Thus only tree link failure may cause many nodes to change their levels. Some inequalities can be 
derived as follows. 
　 “The number of influential links＂ < “The number of tree links＂  …a 
　 “The number of tree links＂  = “The number of nodes＂  –  “The number of 
clusters＂  …b 
　 “The number of total links＂  = “The number of nodes＂  ×  “Average Degree 
/2＂  …c 
　 From b, c 
The ratio of tree links to total links (denoted by rT) < “2/Average Degree”  …d 
　 From a, d 
The ratio of influential links to total links (denoted by rI) < “2/Average Degree”  # 
3.4. Routing 
After the cluster construction in section 3.2, the network is partitioned into a set of 
non-overlapping clusters. The cluster head maintains the topological status of the cluster and the

　 Bci,ci+1 is a set of bordering nodes of Ci connected to Ci+1 
　 MCS(s,t) is a number of links in minimum cut set from s to t, s and t are sets of nodes 
Then:  
RL(P) = MIN{ MIN{ #L(Ci,Ci+1), i = 1~ t-1 }  
,MCS( source , Bc1,c2 )  
,MIN{ MCS( Bci,ci-1 , Bci,ci+1), i = 2~ t-1}  
,MCS( Bct,ct-1 , destination ) } 
So GCR can obtain a routing path to satisfy the different demand parameters of QoS by using 
RL(P) in route discovery phase. 
shows the successful rates of different QoS requirements with different average degrees. We 
define that the inter-cluster link connectivity of Ci and Cj is the number of links in L(Ci,Cj). The 
average inter-cluster link connectivity is the number of total inter-cluster links divided by the 
number of total super links (regarded clusters as super nodes). In Figure 14, we get that the 
successful rate of the QoS requirement i is increasing quickly after the average inter-cluster link 
connectivity is over i. Since the connectivity inside clusters is stronger than the inter-cluster link 
connectivity, the inter-cluster link connectivity becomes the main factor in RL(P).

討論 
Cluster heads failure or migration will result in heavy maintenance cost to reconstruct or 
maintain clusters in GCR. Two strategies mentioned in section 3.3 reduce the probability of the 
cluster head migration and failure greatly in our simulation study in Figure 15 and Figure16. In 
Figure 15, we denote influential links between cluster heads and all their neighbors as level 1 
influential links. The Athreshold is defined in ABR [22]. The beacon interval is 1 second in our

計畫自評 
In the third stage of this project, we have studied the related two-tier infrastructures of MANET 
in (T5). We designed a cluser construction method that can cover dense areas and avoid 
articulation nodes, a method to rank ongoing routes according to stability, and a distributed data 
structure to represent clusters which can minimize control overheads due to mobility. Than we 
simulate those solutions with NS-2 simulator. For (T6), We build an efficient and reliable 
cluster-based QoS routing protocol, and confirm it’s performance with NS-2 simulator. 
In this project, we have proposed an efficiently repairable routing protocol, called gravitational 
cluster routing (GCR) protocol. The major difference between GCR and previous clustering routing 
protocols is that the cluster structure in GCR has two special features, fault tolerance and no 
duplicate topology information. Therefore, such a cluster structure can be maintained efficiently 
and be a QoS aware backbone for upper-layer protocols. On the other hand, in order to enhance the 
endto- end perceived QoS, we exploit the above QoS aware backbone to reduce the routing path 
length and quantify repairable levels of routing paths to satisfy the higher requirement of QoS. In 
order to demonstrate the feasibility of our work, we propose two theorems and depict simulation 
results to prove that the cluster structures of GCR are stable and inexpensive. We compare the 
repair cost and repair time of GCR and routing zone–based route maintenance techniques by 
simulation. GCR is more suitable for large-scale and dense ad hoc networks than ZRP by the 
simulation results. For future work, we will consider more features of clusters, such as higher 
connectivity, to construct stronger (stable) cluster structures. More different demands of QoS will 
be considered for the cluster backbone. Furthermore, our work could be integrated with other 
heterogeneous networks.

一、參加會議經過 
 
這是一個和演算法，計算理論，圖論與組合學等領域相關的Theoretical 
Computer Science與Discrete Mathematics會議，今年是第18屆，以往的名稱是
AWOCA (Australian Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms)。由於歷年會議
名聲甚佳，參與的各國學者越來越多，今年起遂擴大舉辦，將名稱由AWOCA 改成
IWOCA。此次會議仍在澳洲舉行，但明年起開始由各國輪流舉辦，目前已經安排
明年(2008年)在日本舉行，後年(2009年)在中國大陸舉行，2010年則在東歐的捷
克舉行。 
此次會議在Lake Macquarie舉行。這是在New South Wales州Newcastle市郊
的一個湖泊，風景優美。我搭機抵達雪梨(Sydney)後，從中央車站搭上向北開往
Newcastle的火車，於中間的Wyee站下車，然後主辦單位(Newcastle大學)再派人
開車來接我們到開會地點。 
 
此次會期一共有五天。頭三天的早上各有兩場演講，中午午餐後也有一場演
講，這些均是請世界各地的知名學者來介紹他們目前的研究問題與研究成果。這
三天都是在演講結束後，下午安排兩個session的時間，由此次投稿的人員上台
報告。我是被安排在第二天的下午報告。第四天和第五天的上午則都是由投稿的
人上台。另外第四天還安排了一個小型旅遊，帶大家到附近的知名釀酒地—獵人
谷(Hunter Valley)參觀。 
 
另外這個會議比較特殊的地方是特地安排了open problem session，時間在
頭三天議程的最後一個小時。在這個session中，一共收集提出了七個目前尚未
解開的open problem，將其介紹給所有與會人員，提供大家未來作研究的一個可
能方向。
