1313 Horng et al.: Pulsatile blood flow 1313blood flow inside and its surrounding tissue is ever reported,
and the whole physics remains poorly understood. Craciu-
nescu and Clegg15 numerically solved the axis-symmetric
Navier-Stokes equations to obtain the pulsatile velocity pro-
file and then computed the energy transport equation to ob-
tain the temperature distribution of pulsating blood flow in a
blood vessel with sizes of aorta, large arteries, terminal arte-
rial branches, and arterioles. Some cases of their simulation
have pulsation of large amplitude such that reversal of blood
flow occurs in large vessels i.e., 3 mm in diameter and
larger. However, they only focused on the temperature dis-
tribution within a blood vessel and did not consider that for
its surrounding tissue. Shih et al.8 computed the coupled heat
transfer problem of both a large blood vessel and its sur-
rounding tissue. However, they only assumed the velocity
profile of the blood flow inside the vessel to be simply steady
and uniform. They found that the thermal dose would be
insufficient for treatment in the region near blood vessel
when the radius and flow rate are large. Shih et al.9 extended
Shih et al.8 to investigate the influence of various heating
speeds with the total heat applied held equal and found the
thermal dose deficit in the region near blood vessel is less
severe when the heating speed is large. Here we studied this
coupled heat transfer problem between a thermally signifi-
cant blood vessel and its surrounding tissue during heat treat-
ment by considering the velocity profile of the blood flow
being uniform, parabolic, and pulsatile under various radii of
vessel, pulsating frequencies and amplitudes in the case of
pulsatile velocity profile, and heating speeds. The main ob-
ject is to realize the effects of flow velocity profile, size of
vessel, flow arte, and heating speed on thermal dose distri-
bution of the surrounding tissue during heat treatment.
Though many factors about blood vessels have been brought
into consideration in the current study compared with exist-
ing literatures, it is still far from being complete. Many other
factors such as vessel wall elasticity, porosity, rheology of
blood, realistic shape of blood pressure wave, possible
counter current flow, and even turbulence in pulsatile blood
flow are either ignored or simplified in the current
study.11,12,29 Here the whole paper is organized as follows:
the mathematical model and its governing equations fol-
lowed by its numerical method are described in the section
of mathematical model and numerical method. The numeri-
cal results are presented in the section of results and discus-
sions with the effects of flow velocity profile, size of vessel,
flow rate, and heating speed on thermal dose distribution
discussed. The final section is conclusion to summarize all
key physics in this study.
II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND NUMERICAL
METHOD
A. Velocity profile of pulsatile blood flow in a circular
blood vessel
Besides being simply steady uniform or parabolic, the
pulsation of blood flow is considered here and its velocity
profile is derived as follows. Here, we assume the blood flow
to be incompressible, laminar and Newtonian obeyingMedical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2007Navier-Stokes equations in a cylindrical impermeable blood
vessel with rigid wall of radius r0. The axial Hagen-

For pulsatile flows, the pressure gradient above is no more a
constant, and is in fact periodic in time due to the rhythmic
nature of beating heart. To mimic the realistic shape of pres-
sure gradient in time, it requests at least 11 harmonics,29 and
here we simply consider the fundamental one only for the
feasibility of analysis. With this additional sinusoidal com-
ponent in time, the corresponding pressure gradient, without
loss of major physics, along the z-axis of blood vessel can be
assumed periodically as

1317 Horng et al.: Pulsatile blood flow 1317C. Calculation of thermal dose
The accumulated thermal dose to tissue is a function of
heating duration and the temperature level. The estimate of
tissue damage is based on the thermal dose of which the
formula was proposed by Sapareto and Dewey.31 The ther-
mal dose or equivalent minutes at 43 °C EM43 is shown as
follows:

RT−43dt , 16
where R=2 for T
43 °C, R=4 for 37 °CT43 °C, and
tf =90 s or 120 s in current simulation. The threshold dose
for necrosis is EM43=240 min for muscle tissue.32 Therefore,
the region encircled by the level curve EM43=240 min is
taken as the thermal lesion region in this study. Covering
tumor tissue but not normal tissue by thermal lesion region
as full as possible is most desired in the thermal treatment,Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2007and the deficit would serve as an evaluation of the effective-
ness of the treatment. This region is greatly influenced by
size of blood vessel31 and the heating speed.32 Here three
different heating schemes characterizing different heating
speeds under the same amount of heat added 100 J cm−3
from preliminary energy analysis in lump33 are depicted in
Table II.
D. Numerical method
Here we used method of lines MOL to solve Eqs.
8–15. First, we employed multi-block Chebyshev pseu-
dospectral method to discretize governing equations 8 and
9, boundary and interface conditions 10–15 in space
into a semi-discrete system in time. This coupled system
consists of ordinary differential equations in time, mainly
from Eqs. 8 and 9, and algebraic equations, chiefly from
boundary and interface conditions 10–15. We can then

1319 Horng et al.: Pulsatile blood flow 1319interface due to the characteristics of Chebyshev collocation
points.34–36 This feature makes the computational accuracy
and efficiency far better than the one without any decompo-
sition. In short, owing to the intrinsic high order of accuracy
of pseudospectral methods, grid size is not that restricted as
finite difference/element methods and, hence, the overall
computation is very efficient.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Figure 4 compares the effects of steady uniform and para-
bolic velocity profiles for blood flow on thermal lesion re-
gion with heating scheme I in Table II, which has the least
thermal dose deficit as described in Shih et al.9 Likewise,
Fig. 5 compares the effects of pulsatile blood flow with vari-
ous pulsatile frequencies 1, 1.5, and 2 Hz with the relative
intensity of pulsation fac=0.2 on thermal lesion region with
heating Scheme I in Table II. Figures 4 and 5 generally show
that there is almost no difference in thermal lesion region
among all these velocity profiles under the same size of
blood vessel. Only minor difference of thermal lesion region
in blood vessel is observed in middle-sized blood vessels
with diameter 0.6 and 1 mm. This minor difference is most
pronounced for blood vessel of diameter 1 mm and is par-
ticularly shown in Fig. 6. It shows that the length of thermal
lesion region in blood vessel is longest for uniform velocity
profile, shortest for parabolic and 1.5 Hz pulsatile ones, and
in between for 1 and 2 Hz pulsatile flows.
While the thermal lesion region is rather insensitive to the
velocity profile of blood flow, it is deeply influenced by the
size of blood vessel since the heat convection by the blood
flow in a blood vessel usually serves as a stronger heat sink
than the blood perfusion in tissue. That means temperature
would drop faster in a blood vessel than its surrounding tis-
sue. This may cause deficit of thermal lesion region in blood
vessel and tissue nearby, which can be easily observed from
Figs. 4 and 5. Generally the deficit of thermal lesion region is
less for smaller vessels. In the case of smallest vessel here
with diameter 0.2 mm, thermal lesion region almost covers
the whole blood vessel inside the tumor and the deficit is
naturally the least. For middle-sized vessels here with diam-
eter 0.6 and 1 mm, the thermal lesion region in blood vessel
becomes smaller and shifted downstream. For large vessels
here with diameter 1.4 and 2 mm, there is a total deficit of
thermal lesion region in blood vessel, and this would cause
deficit in tumor tissue right near the blood vessel especially
at the upstream.
Besides diameters of blood vessel, the thermal lesion re-
gion is also very sensitive to the heating speed. Figure 7
generally shows larger thermal lesion region for faster heat-
ing, and the heating speed affects more pronouncedly when
the blood vessel is larger. As shown in Fig. 7b, there exists
an obvious shift of thermal lesion region to the downstream
of blood vessel for the blood vessel with diameter 1 mm
when heating is fast, and this may cause unwanted thermal
injury in normal tissue nearby. Figure 8 particularly shows
the temperature contours for the case of blood vessel diam-
eter of 1 mm under heating Scheme I in Fig. 7 at the time ofMedical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2007power off t=2 s. Notice that the highest temperature occurs
right at the downstream of blood vessel. This causes the
thermal damage of the normal tissue nearby.
The effect of pulsation amplitude, in terms of relative in-
tensity fac, of pulsatile blood flow on the thermal lesion
region generally has little difference among various fac’s,
except minor difference for middle-sized blood vessels. Fig-
ures 9–11 depicts this effect for a middle-sized blood vessel
of diameter 1 mm with fac=0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1 and fre-
quency being at 1 Hz Fig. 9, 1.5 Hz Fig. 10, and 2 Hz
Fig. 11, respectively. When fac increases, the blood flows
more in a stick-slip fashion, and this may considerably influ-
ence the heat convection when incorporated with pulsation
frequency. Figures 9, 10, 11c, and 11d, with fac=0.8 and
1, respectively, show obviously two-peak behavior in ther-
mal dose contour at the downstream of blood vessel, which
is chiefly because of large pulsation amplitude.
IV. CONCLUSION
The current investigation shows that the effect of velocity
profile of blood flow, ranging from uniform, parabolic, to
pusatile ones, has almost no difference in thermal lesion re-
gion on tumor region and minor difference only on blood
vessel when the blood vessel is of middle size. This result
suggests that we might just as well use the simplest steady
uniform velocity profile to do the simulation without signifi-
cant difference in thermal lesion region of tumor. In fact, the
thermal lesion region is much more sensitive to heating
speed and size of blood vessel. Some studies8,9,26,33 show
that faster heating would form a much better thermal lesion
