considered. The results obtained with the receptance 
method are compared with the available analytical and 
numerical solutions. 
The primary objective of the present study is to 
illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in solving 
a general eigenvalue problem. Besides, certain 
approach similar to Lagrange Multiplier or Penalty 
Function used in the finite element method will be 
developed. Without re-meshing, only by processing 
the original finite element mesh with this approach, 
the engineers are able to compute buckling 
characteristics of beam stiffened shells. Hope to help 
FEM people to save enormous time and effort. 
2. Solution approach 
When a sub-structure is added to a major 
structure, the receptance method is applied by adding 
the point receptances of the sub-structure to those of 
the major structure at the interface. For instance, a 
simply supported cylindrical shell subjected to an 
axial compressive force P and stiffened by k parallel 
beams, as illustrated in Figure 1, or by k parallel rings, 
as illustrated in Figure 2, can be viewed as the case 
where the beams or the rings (the sub-structures) are 
added to the shell (the major structure). At the 
interface of each shell-beam pair, in general, there are 
the axial and the transverse displacements and the 
axial slope, together with appropriate point force or 
point moment connections could be considered. 
However, the receptances due to the axial 
displacement of the shell and the axial displacement 
of the beam may be neglected since they are much less 
in order of magnitude. Only the transverse 
displacement and the axial slope change need to be 
concerned. The relevant loading connection at the 
interface of each shell-beam pair (Figure 3) or each 
shell-ring pair (Figure 4) is simplified to a point force 
connection coupled with a point moment connection. 
The point force and point moment at the interface 
result in displacement and slope, respectively. The 
displacement (or slope), u
iAX (u=1-n, i =1-2), as 
functions of force (or moment), v
jAF (v =1-n, j =1-2), 
are { } [ ] { }v jATvjuiu iA FX α=  (1), where the vjuiα  are the 
receptances of the major system (the shell); the 
superscript u indicates the order number of n interface 
points between the shell and each beam; the 
superscript v indicates the order number of n 
interactive loads for each shell-beam pair. The 
subscript i represents the type of movement, namely, 1 
for the linear displacement and 2 for the slope. The 
subscript j represents the type of load, namely, 1 for 
the force and 2 for the moment. Similarly, 
{ } [ ] { }v jBTvjruiuiB FX β=  (2), where vjrui β  (r=1-k) are 
receptances of the sub-system (the beam). When the 
receptances are applied to add a sub-system to a major 
system, with no external forces (or moments) applied 
to the two systems, it is required that }{}{ v jBv jA FF −= , 
due to the force (or moment) equilibrium, and 
}{}{ uiB
u
iA XX = , due to the displacement (or slope) 
compatibility. Combining Equations (1) and (2), and 
applying the above equalities gives

4. Results and discussion 
The beam stiffened shell is considered for two 
eccentric beam stiffener configurations, containing 
two longitudinal stiffening beams which are 180 
degrees apart, and four longitudinal stiffening beams 
which are 90 degrees apart. The shell length to 
thickness ratio is kept at 30 for all cases. The ratio of 
the critical buckling loads is denoted as P ,
cr
s PPP /1= , 
where sP1 is the critical buckling load of a shell with 
stiffener, while crP  is the critical buckling load of a 
shell without stiffener. Figure 5 shows variation of 
percentage difference between results obtained by 
using FEM and receptance method with sb th ratio 
for the cylindrical shell stiffened with either beams or 
rings, where bh  is depth of the beam or the ring, st  
is the thickness of the shell. It is seen the results 
obtained by the receptance method agree well with the 
FEM results. 
Figure 6 shows variation of ratio of the critical 
buckling load, P , with sb th ratio for a cylindrical 
shell stiffened by two and four longitudinal beams. It 
is seen, with two longitudinal beams, P converges to 
5 as the flexural rigidity of the beam rises. If the shell 
is stiffened by four longitudinal beams, P converges

研究計畫之背景及目的 
原本航空工業使用的重量輕及強度高的輕重量結
構(light-weight structure)，如今幾乎應用在所有工業
上，工業界在設計輕重量機件結構時，為了防止板
與殼受力後產生挫曲(buckling)變形，通常會用加強
肋、加強樑、加強環等 stiffener，以增強結構之剛
性，使強度及穩定性符合需要。但是在造形複雜的
主結構上添加一些 stiffener，其位置為何？尺寸多
少？數量若干？就要靠嘗試的方法來尋求最佳解。 
工業界在作有限元素分析時，將一個複雜構形的網
格做好後，若因為每一個設計上的小改變都要重新
建網格，是很麻煩而且費時的，有時由於耦合作用
而在技術上不可行。因此工業界常使用「次結構法」
(sub-structuring method)，加一些樑元素或板元素到
要補強的主結構元素群上，使其剛性增加，但維持
原有主結構之網格不變。譬如在設計大的 roof panel
時，先建好基本構形網格，再嘗試往上加肋、加樑、
加板予以強化。這種次結構法當然會有誤差，但是
可以看出小的次結構加在大的主結構之上的效
應，因而可作為設計的參考。 
次結構法雖然在 FEM 中用得很多，但只是一些程
序步驟，並沒有一個標準的方法。在理論方面，若
是將不同的結構相互連接，接納法 (receptance 
method)可算是一個有理論基礎的次結構法，在振
動領域之應用，已見諸甚多文獻。因此，本研究旨
在以接納法的觀念，分析在板殼結構上加肋、加
樑、加環後，對原結構強度及穩定性之影響，並研
究：此種「添加型」接納法對於次結構的形狀、大
小和數量，加在主結構的位置，主結構的負荷條件
及邊界條件等之適用性如何？這些參數之變化會
如何影響所算結果之精確度？誤差會如何變化？
當結構為非對稱時，此種方法是否仍然適用？...
等等，以期建立一套理論。 
學界對板殼結構穩定性之研究進行了一個世紀，以
圓柱殼為例，其受到軸向壓力之理論解最早由
Lorenz 在 1911年提出。Southwell 在 1913年，Von 
Mises在1914年分別提出圓柱殼受到均勻側向壓力
而挫曲的理論解。1932年 Flugge 提出圓柱殼受到
聯合負荷而挫曲之理論解。Schwerin 在 1925 年，
Donnel 在 1933年分別提出圓柱殼受到扭轉負荷時
之穩定性的報告[1]。數十年來在這方面的研究甚
多，全盛期是由於 1950年代以降的 NASA 太空計
劃，促成數以千計關於板殼結構振動、靜態與動態
穩定性的論文產生。以目前 Compendex 所能查詢
的 1969年至 2003年期間發表的有關板結構挫曲的
論文共 4200 篇，其中 662 篇是關於 stiffened plate
挫曲的論文，stiffener 包括了 rib、beam、girder、
stringer 等類，在這其中有 193 篇是關於具加強樑之
板(beam stiffened plate)挫曲的論文。同一時期有關
殼結構挫曲的論文共 3506 篇，其中 514 篇是關於
stiffened shell 挫曲的論文，在這其中有 212 篇是關
於具加強環之殼(ring stiffened shell)挫曲的論文。 
回顧這些研究具加強樑或加強環之板殼結構穩定

[2-3]，Hatzidakis 等[4]使用有限元素法分析具加強
