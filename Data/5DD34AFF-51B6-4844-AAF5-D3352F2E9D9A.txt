I. Introduction, Motivation, and Literature review 
Nowadays the convenience of data transmission creates an information explosion 
era. As receiving more and more information in our daily life, the desire for storing 
the interested information easily and cheaply is no more under the table. Until now, 
there are many storage devices trying to satisfy the requirement for data storage. 
Among those devices, magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) provide the largest storage 
capacity as well as the lowest cost. From the personal computer to the Cloud 
technique, all these ideas are realized through HDDs. Therefore, HDDs play an 
important role and make our life much easier than before. 
 
Perpendicular recording technique, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), is the technique 
mainly utilized to store information in a HDD. In this technique, each single bit is 
composed of the magnetization pointed either upward or downward, and the 
information is read or written through the magnetic head. The corresponding 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-sectional and plan-view images are 
shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. We use yellow both lines and arrows to 
represent each bit. There are many grains in a single bit, and since each grain is 
partially separated by nonmagnetic grain boundaries, we can define different bits. The 
structure of this morphology is known as a granular structure. Since positions of 
grains are randomly distributed, the transition region between bit-to-bit is not smooth. 
The transition roughness is the main source of noise in the granular perpendicular 
recording media. 
 
 
 
While we increase the recording density, we decrease the bit sizes of bits. The 
noise generated by the transition roughness between bit-to-bit becomes more and 
more serious. One promising way to smooth the transition region is to reduce grain 
sizes of grains. However, in a small grain, thermal energy may randomize the 
direction of magnetization and eventually leads to recording errors. This problem is 
known as the superparamagnetic limit. The thermal stability can be estimated by the 
thermal stability factor of KuV/kBT, where Ku is the crystalline anisotropy constant, V 
is the effective volume, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T represents the 
Fig. 1 (a) Schematic diagram for perpendicular recording media. The corresponding 
TEM plane-view and cross-sectional images are shown in (b) and (c). We use yellow 
both lines and arrows to represent each bit. 
 3 
By combing L10 FePt, which possesses a high Ku value, with the bit patterned 
technique, it is expected to realize the ultra-high density recording media. Figure 3 
illustrates a typical fabrication process for a L10 FePt dot array. After obtaining a thin 
and continuous L10 FePt film by using a heat treatment, we then perform the 
patterning process to transfer films into dot arrays. However, there are usually voids 
accompanying with the ordering process in FePt films during the heat treatment. 
These voids then inhibit us to further pattern films into dots. This void generation 
process is known as agglomeration.2 TEM plan-view images of agglomerated L10 
FePt films grown on a Si||SiO2 substrate after annealing at varied temperature are 
illustrated in Fig. 3.3 Agglomeration is a dewetting process of an initially continuous 
film during the annealing process and is thermodynamically driven by the reduction 
of total surface free energy in the film-substrate system.2 During the agglomeration in 
thin films, voids initially nucleate at grooves of grain boundaries and growth of voids 
eventually leads to the formation of islands. Kinetically, agglomeration is 
accomplished by a mass transport, which is mainly dominated by the surface diffusion. 
Agglomeration of annealed bare FePt films on MgO underlayers,4 MgO or SiO2 
substrates3,5 has been observed and is attributed to the large difference in the surface 
energy of crystalline FePt (~ 2100 ergs/cm2)6 and that of amorphous SiO2 (~ 300 
ergs/cm2)7 and crystallized MgO (~ 1500 ergs/cm2).7 To utilize thin L10 FePt films for 
bit patterned media, we need to suppress the agglomeration during high temperature 
processes.

II. Experiment 
 
i. Thin, continuous L10 FePt film 
The fabrication procedure for FePt films is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5. All 
samples were deposited using dc magnetron sputtering system at ambient temperature 
with a base pressure lower than 8x10-8 Torr. The layer structure of samples is Si || 
SiO2 (200 nm) substrates/ FePt (4 nm)/ FeOx (Y nm), where Y ranges from 0 to 1.3 
nm. The FePt layer was co-sputtered from elemental targets at 3mTorr of Ar. 
Chemical compositions of as-deposited samples were confirmed as Fe52Pt48 by using 
inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. After deposition of FePt, the oxygen 
plasma treatment was performed to obtain the oxide cap layer. The oxygen plasma 
was produced by using 3 mTorr of Ar and O2 (Ar:O2 = 4:1) on the area of 4-inch 
diameter with a power of 30 watts. Oxide cap layers with varied layer thickness were 
achieved by controlling the plasma treatment time. We adjusted the initial FePt layer 
thickness and the plasma oxidation time to obtain the nearly constant thickness of the 
FePt layer (4 nm). The thickness of FePt and oxide layers was measured from TEM 
cross-sectional images. All samples were then annealed at 500 0C for 10 seconds in a 
vacuum of 5x10-5 Torr by a rapid thermal annealing system. 
 
 
 
ii. Magnetization reversal behavior in shaped L10 FePt films 
Fig. 6 shows the fabrication procedure for FePt films with varied morphologies. 
All samples were deposited at room temperature by using an ultra-high vacuum 
sputtering system. The layer structure of samples is Si || SiO2 substrates/ (FePt 5 nm). 
The FePt layer was co-sputtered from elemental targets at 3 mTorr of Ar. Samples 
were then annealed at 350 0C for 10 seconds in a rapid thermal annealing system. 
After annealing, we deposited Ti and Al layers with a layer thickness of 5 and 100 nm, 
respectively, on top of the FePt layer. We then performed the anodization process to 
obtain the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template on top of FePt and Ti layers. 
During the anodization process, the sample was anodized at 25 V in 0.3 M H2SO4 at 1 
0C, followed by widening the pores in the template by using 3 wt% phosphoric acid at 
Fig. 5 Schematic representation of the fabrication procedure of L10 FePt films. 
 7 
In all experiments, structure and chemical analyses were performed by x-ray 
diffraction (XRD), grazing incident x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with an incident angle 
of 0.40, x-ray absorption spectrum (XAS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 
TEM. The x-ray source for x-ray diffractions was a Cu Kα radiation source, and the 
XAS measurements were executed at the Dragon beam line 11A at the National 
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan. Magnetic properties were obtained 
using both a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and a physical property 
measurement system (PPMS).

thickness from 0 to 0.9 nm, suggesting an eliminated (111) texture and a well-aligned 
(001) easy axis. The anisotropy field of sample with a 0.9-nm-thick cap layer is 7 
Tesla, as revealed in the in-plane hysteresis loop (not shown) measured by PPMS. 
Further increase in the cap-layer-thickness from 0.9 to 1.3 nm decreases all out-of-
plane coercivity, squareness of out-of-plane loops, and anisotropy fields. 
 
Figs. 10(a) to 10(c) illustrate the TEM plan-view images of annealed samples with 
a cap layer thickness of 0, 0.9, and 1.3 nm, respectively. While significant 
agglomeration is observed in the bare FePt film [Fig. 10(a)], the agglomeration is 
significantly suppressed by introducing a cap layer. A continuous FePt layer is 
achieved by using a 0.9-nm-thick oxide layer [Fig. 10(b)]. TEM cross-sectional 
images of annealed samples with a cap layer thickness of 0, 0.9, and 1.3 nm are 
shown in Figs. 11(a) to 11(c), respectively. While a discontinuous bare FePt film with 
a rough surface is observed [Fig. 11(a)], the discontinuity and surface roughness is 
effectively reduced by introducing a cap layer. We can obtain a continuous FePt layer 
with a flat film surface by using a 0.9-nm-thick oxide layer [Fig. 11(b)]. Combining 
with the plan-view and cross-sectional TEM images, the continuous FePt film with a 
flat surface is the consequence of the inhibited agglomeration due to the introduction 
of a cap layer. The corresponding high-resolution TEM cross-sectional images are 
shown in Figs. 11(d) to 11(f). We use white arrows to denote the normal of both (001) 
and (111) planes in FePt films and the crossed dashed lines to represent the substrate 
plane and the substrate plane normal. While a broad (001)-orientation angular 
distribution is observed in the bare FePt film [Fig. 11(d)], it is significantly narrowed 
in the FePt film with 0.9-nm-thick cap layer [Fig. 11(e)]. Furthermore, a (111)-
textured grain is observed in the film with a 1.3-nm-thick cap layer [Fig. 11(f)]. These 
results are in accordance with XRD scans [Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)].

formation of (001) texture, leading to a continuous film with a well-aligned c-axis. 
The changes of film morphology and distributions of c-axis also reflect on the 
observed hysteresis loops (Fig. 9). A continuous film with narrow FWHM for the 
sample with a 0.9 nm cap layer reveals a nearly hysteresis-free hard-axis loop with a 
high anisotropy field (7 T) and a quite square easy-axis loop. 
 
In addition of change of film morphologies, we also notice that it is very difficult 
to identify the presence of the oxide layer after annealing in the cross-sectional TEM 
images. To further probe the change of the oxide layer during annealing, we 
performed the XAS experiment to investigate the chemical state of Fe. The photon 
energy ranges from 10 eV to 1700 eV, and the energy resolution is ~ 36 meV. The 
corresponding XAS spectra, collected by total electron yield (TEY) mode, of Fe L2,3-
edge of samples with varied oxide layer thickness before and after annealing are 
shown in Figs. 12(a) to 12(c), respectively. Since the probing depth of TEY mode is 
around 5 nm, the signal is mainly contributed from the FePt and oxide layers. While 
the Fe L2,3-edge of as-deposited bare FePt layer shows a single peak, there are 
shoulders beside the Fe L2,3-edge for samples with an oxide cap layer before 
annealing, and intensities of shoulders increase with increasing the cap layer thickness. 
After annealing, the intensity of shoulder significantly drops in the samples with 
oxide layers, indicating the reduction of Fe oxides to Fe. It has been previously 
demonstrated that in the case of FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell nanoparticles, the 
transformation of Pt-rich FePt to Fe3Pt nanoparticles is catalyzed by the reduction of 
Fe3O4 shell during annealing, which facilitates the interdiffusion of Fe and Pt.18 In the 
present work, the reduction of Fe oxides in the cap layer could thus accelerate the 
interdiffusion of Fe and Pt, which promotes the L10 ordering. Consequently, we can 
suppress the agglomeration and maintain the highly (001) L10 phase in FePt films by 
using an Fe-oxide cap layer. 
 
 
 
 
The activation energy for L10 ordering is related to the composition of FePt 
films.13 Since we obtain the FeOx layer by purposely oxidizing Fe in FePt films, the 
reduction of Fe oxides into Fe during the post-annealing process not only promotes 
the L10 ordering but manipulates the composition of FePt films back to the nearly 
equal-atomic composition. As we increase the cap layer thickness to 1.3 nm, the Fe 
oxides are not totally reduced during the annealing process, as illustrated by the 
Fig. 12 XAS spectra of samples with oxide layers of varied cap layer thickness (a) 
before and (b) after annealing. 
 13 
ii. Magnetization reversal behavior in shaped L10 FePt films 
After fabrication of a thin and continuous L10 FePt film, we patterned the film by 
utilizing the AAO template. Figures 14(a) and 14(b) show the SEM image and the 
corresponding schematic illustration of AAO template after the pore widening process, 
respectively. By controlling the wet etching time, we can obtain the AAO template 
directly grown on the FePt and Ti layers with pores of an average diameter of 40 nm. 
The SEM image of the patterned FePt dots is illustrated in Fig.	  14(c), and Fig.	  14(d) 
shows the corresponding schematic representation. By introducing the AAO template, 
we successfully fabricate the FePt isolate dots with an average diameter of 40 nm, and 
the mean center-to-center distance is 80 nm. 
 
 
 
As pattern transfer continuous, 5-nm-thick films were first patterned into films 
with bump dots on top, then eventually isolated dots, as illustrated in Fig. 15(a). We 
define the thickness of bump dots as X nm. With increasing the etching time, the 
thickness of bump dots increases from 0 (continuous layer) to 5 nm (isolated dots). 
Fig. 15(b) shows the hysteresis loops of sample with varied thickness of bump dots, 
and the corresponding thickness-dependence of coercivity is illustrated in Fig. 15(c). 
The coercivity suddenly increases with increasing the dot thickness from 0 to 1 nm. 
For dots with 1-3 nm thickness, the decreased thickness of the etched film reduces the 
coercivity. As the dot thickness is increased from 3 to 5 nm, the coercivity increases. 
Fig. 14 SEM images of (a) the AAO template directly grown on the FePt and Ti 
layers after the pore widening process and (c) FePt dots after the whole patterning 
procedure. The corresponding schematic representations are shown in (b) and (d). 
 15 
 
To further understand the discrepancy between the experimental and simulated 
coercivity with increasing the dot thickness from 0 to 1 nm, we performed the etching 
process directly on FePt films without any mask on surfaces. Hysteresis loops of FePt 
bare films before and after the etching process are shown in Fig. 18. The coercivity of 
bare FePt film increases after the etching process. In the simulated cases of bare FePt 
films (not shown), the coercivity continuous decreases with increasing the etching 
time. The decreased coercivity values of simulated bare FePt films are mainly 
contributed from the reduced total volume of films as etching process continues. The 
increased coercivity value in the experiment suggests that the etching process could 
produce defects, which are not considered in the simulation. Those defects could act 
as domain wall pinning sites during magnetization reversal. As a result, the 
experimental coercivity of film with 1-nm-thick bump dots on surfaces as a whole 
increases, while the simulated one slightly decreases.  
 
Fig. 17 (a) Simulated hysteresis loops of samples with bump dots of varied thickness. 
Both simulated and experimental thickness-dependence of coercivity is shown in (b). 
 17 
 
In the sample with 4.5-nm-thick bump dots on surfaces, we can observe a two-
step magnetization reversal in the simulated hysteresis loop [Fig. 17(a)]. Figures 20(a) 
to 20(c) illustrate the simulated domain configurations of sample with 4.5-nm-thick 
bump dots on surfaces during the magnetization reversal, and the corresponding 
schematic representations are shown in Figs. 20(d) to 20(f). With increasing the 
applied field, the etched film acts as a magnetically soft region and starts to reverse. 
However, as we increase the thickness of bump dots, we decrease the contact area 
between the etched film and the unetched dots. The reduced contact area between the 
soft and hard regions decrease the exchange coupling in between. Therefore, as the 
thickness of the etched film is only 0.5 nm, the decreased exchange coupling between 
the etched film and unetched dots results in the separated reversals of these two 
regions. The separated reversals then yield a two-step reversal in the hysteresis loop, 
as illustrated in Fig. 17(b). The first step magnetization reversal represents the reverse 
of the etched film, and the subsequent reverse of unetched dots results in the second 
step reversal. Owing to the two-step reversal, the coercivity as a whole increases. 
 
Finally the pattern transfers into isolated dots, and the simulated domain 
configurations while magnetization reversals are shown in Fig. 21. During the 
reversal process, the centered dot reverses first owing to the strongest dipolar field 
contributed from surrounded dots. After the centered dot reverses, the rest of dots then 
randomly reverse with further increasing the applied field. In addition to the different 
dipolar fields, the varied of switching fields of dots are contributed from the vanished 
exchange coupling between dots, since we totally remove the etched film. Therefore, 
we can observe several reversal steps, which yield the highest coercivity, in the 
hysteresis loop [Fig. 17]. 
Fig. 19 Simulated domain configurations of samples with 4-nm-thick bump dots on 
surfaces during the magnetization reversal process are shown in (a) to (c). The orange 
and green colors represent the magnetization pointing up and down. The 
corresponding schematic illustrations are shown in (d) to (f). 
 19 
iii. Ultra-high density L10 FePt dots 
We have fabricated L10 FePt dot arrays with dots of an averaged diameter of 40 
nm by introducing an AAO template. We also established the corresponding 
simulation to study the magnetization reversal behaviours in shaped FePt films during 
the etching process. To meet the requirement of ultra-high density L10 FePt dot arrays, 
we applied the di-block copolymer as the template and then performed the etching. 
Out-of-plane hysteresis loops of samples before (continuous films) and after the 
etching process (isolated dots) is illustrated in Fig. 22(a). Before etching, we can 
observe a square loop, representing a continuous film with less domain wall pinning 
site. The coercivity increases from 3000 Oe to 7841 Oe after etching. The increased 
coercivity, which is mainly contributed from the decreased slope at coercivity in the 
hysteresis loop, suggests that the film morphology turns into isolated dots after the 
etching process. The corresponding SEM image after the etching process is shown in 
Fig. 22(b). The average diameter of dots is around 25 nm.

dots. The corresponding SEM image of dots is shown in (b). 
 21 
we transfer the time into frequency domains in a power spectrum through the fast 
Fourier transformation [Fig. 25(b)], followed by integration of the spectrum to obtain 
the signal of first harmonic peak. By comparing to the noise extracting from a 
demagnetization state, we can obtain the signal to noise ratio (SNR), which is defined 
as  𝑆𝑁𝑅 = 20 log!"(!!"#!"#$!!"#! ),  
where Vrmsfund and Vrmsn are the square root of the read back signal and that of the 
noise measured from a demagnetization state, respectively.

transformation during a read-write test.

loop taken at Co L3 edge only shows the hysteresis loop of
Co-marker. Since the Co-marker is strongly coupled to the
local FePt, the perpendicular loops of the Co-marker can be
used as the indicator of local magnetization reversal in
FePt.10 By varying the position of the Co-marker, we can get
the anisotropy profile of the FePt along the depth direction.
We prepared three samples of FePt (25 nm)/PtMn (50 nm)//
MgO in which Co was co-sputtered with FePt at the desig-
nated depth, away from the most top surface, of 21 nm (bot-
tom), 14 nm (middle), and 5 nm (top), respectively. The
schematic diagram of the sample structure is shown in the
inset of Fig. 3(b). The nominal thickness of the Co-marker
was 1 nm and the estimated composition, based on the depo-
sition rate, was (Fe80Co20)0.52Pt0.48. Since the thickness of
the Co-marker is thin and Co-marker is strongly coupled to
the adjacent FePt layer, the effect of Co doping on the mag-
netic properties of FePt is almost negligible. The hysteresis
loops of the samples with or without the Co-marker, meas-
ured by VSM, indeed do not show observable differences.
Fig. 3 shows hysteresis loops for the samples with a Co-
marker at different depth measured by VSM and XMCD.
The VSM loops, which give the total magnetic signal from
the sample, for three samples are almost the same. Although
XMCD loops from the Co-marker only are relatively noisy
due to quite limited amount of Co, they reveal that the mid-
dle FePt shows the lowest coercivity rather than the bottom
FePt in which more Mn atoms existed. On the other hand,
the reference samples without the PtMn underlayer (FePt
(25 nm)//MgO) showed identical Co loops measured by
XMCD regardless of the positions of the Co-marker. Two
effects from the PtMn layer have to be taken into considera-
tion. The diffusion of Mn, confirmed by AES profile (Fig. 2),
may lead to the formation of the (Fe1xMnx)Pt alloy. The
more the Mn composition is, the smaller the anisotropy of
the ferromagnetic (Fe1xMnx)Pt is.
6 Another effect is the
presence of antiferromagnetic layer, which can provide an
extra exchange coupling to stabilize the ferromagnetic
layer.9,11,12 Although the interdiffusion exists in the region
near the interface of FePt/PtMn, the Mn content is high
enough to form antiferromagnetic (Mn1xFex)Pt
13; conse-
quently, exchange coupling still exists. Notice that the
exchange coupling is an interfacial phenomenon so its
strength decreases with increasing the distance away from
the interface of FePt/PtMn.
To further confirm the existence of the exchange cou-
pling between PtMn and FePt, we fabricated samples with a
structure of PtMn (x nm)/FePt (25 nm)//MgO. We on pur-
pose put PtMn on the top of FePt to assure the properties of
FePt are not changed by varying the thickness of PtMn. All
the samples with PtMn layers show enhanced coercivity
compared to the sample without PtMn. The dependence of
FePt coercivity on the PtMn thickness, shown in Fig. 4, is
quite similar to the thickness dependence reported in the

magnetic properties and angular dependence of remnant
coercivity were investigated by vibrating sample magnetom-
eter (VSM). The domain size was observed by using mag-
netic force microscopy (MFM).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The anodization reaches the steady state when the for-
mation rate and dissolution rate of the oxide are comparable.
The Ti under-layer is commonly used as the bottom elec-
trode for fabricating AAO templates. Ti is also oxidized dur-
ing anodization, which maintains the anodization at a mild
rate and leads to well-ordered pore arrays. However, when
we use FePt as the bottom electrode, because it is hard to be
oxidized, the dissolution rate at the Al/FePt interface during
anodization is enhanced, leading to abrupt current increase.
The high current and violent dissolution reaction may
destroy the pore structures of AAO during anodization. In
addition to influencing the morphology of AAO, the anodiza-
tion time determined the height of the pores and, hence, the
aspect ratio (R¼ height/pore size) of pores. After anodiza-
tion, the chemical etching was used to not only remove the
side product, Al(OH)3, on the top part of AAO, but enlarge
the pore diameter and reduce the barrier layer thickness.
Both the side product on the top and the barrier layer at the
bottom of AAO may obstruct the RIE process. To optimize
the anodization time of 200 s and pore-widening time of
14min, we can obtain an ordered AAO mask grown on FePt
films shown in Fig. 2(a). The pore density is 4 1010 cm2,
with the pore size of 30 nm and the aspect ratio of 2. The
AAO masks with different R values were used for etching
FePt films, and the SEM images of FePt after RIE are shown
in Fig. 2. It reveals that the aspect ratio (R) of the AAO
mask plays an important role for the formation of the net-
work by using the RIE process. The pore size of the AAO
masks is kept about 30 nm by fixing pore-widening time, and
R is determined by the anodization time. If R is too large,
the plasma is hard to go through the pores to etch FePt, as
shown in Fig. 2(b) for R¼ 5 (anodization time¼ 300 s); on
the other hand, if R is too small, that is, the AAO mask is too
thin to protect FePt from being etched, the network struc-
tures are damaged, as shown in Fig. 2(d) for R¼ 0.5

國科會補助專題研究計畫出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                     日期：   年   月   日 
 
                                
一、參加會議經過 
 志煌於台灣時間 5 月 6 日的飛機飛往溫哥華參與會議，於溫哥華當日時間 5 月
5 日到達，下飛機後前往會議附近的旅館稍作休息，即前往會場，進行註冊動作。 
 志煌在會議過程中不但藉由聆聽報告得到了許多實驗上的啓發，同時也和許多
國際知名的學者交換研究心得，藉由與國際學者的直接討論，獲得了許多難能可貴
的第一手資訊，見識了許多非凡的創舉，對於目前國際上磁性的潮流有最新的掌握。 
  
二、與會心得 
 目前磁記錄媒體已發展到圖樣化磁記錄媒體，許多國際學者皆在研發非黃光微
影的製程方式。電子束微影可以製備小的奈米點陣列，但其製成昂貴且費時，無法
應用於真正的產品。共聚物模板可以便宜且快速地製備奈米點陣列，為這次會議上
熱門討論的話題之一。另外如何有效地製備鐵鉑合金，在低溫即可獲得高序化度的
鐵鉑薄膜仍然為一研究熱題。 
 在寫入資訊的議題上，由於序化鐵鉑合金的翻轉磁場過高，利用其他能源來幫
助其翻轉為目前的趨勢。熱輔助磁記錄媒體，其利用雷射光源加熱欲寫入的磁區來
降低其翻轉磁場，為目前利用磁場翻轉的主要方向之一。在高溫下磁矩如何隨著磁
場做翻轉的動作也在這次會議被廣泛的討論，唯有深入瞭解其翻轉機制才可真正地
將熱輔助寫入應用於產品上，更加提高記錄密度。 
 另外，除了傳統用磁場翻轉磁矩的方式外，利用飛秒極光翻轉磁矩廣泛地在這
次會議被討論。利用極光翻轉磁矩可以打破利用磁場翻轉的時間限制，讓磁矩翻轉
所需時間降低至原本的十萬分之一，若可更深入瞭解且應用於產品上，將可大幅的
降低我們寫入資訊所需的時間，讓磁儲存媒體邁入新的境界。 
 最後，藉由電場改變磁性也廣泛的被大家所研究和報告。原本被大家認為是本
質的磁性質除了換材料外還可藉由電場來調變，可說是在提供了一斬新的研究方向，
讓未來產品上的發展空間有無限的可能性。
