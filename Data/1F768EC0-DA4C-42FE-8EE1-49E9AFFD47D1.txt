Abstract 
Fatigue crack growth experiments tested under 
constant-amplitude loadings have been carried 
out for a considerable amount of specimens 
made of 2024 T-351 aluminum alloy. In total, 
there are three data sets obtained. The results 
reported are specially emphasized on the scatter 
and statistical aspect of these data sets. In 
consideration of the scatters of crack initiation 
life, crack propagation life, and specimen life, it 
is found that the means and standard deviations 
of initiation, propagation, and specimen lives all 
increase as stress ratio R increases. Moreover, 
the coefficient of variation of initiation life is the 
largest and coefficient of variation of specimen 
life is the smallest for all three data sets. Besides, 
the negative linear correlation between median 
value of specimen life and stress amplitude is 
found also, where the specimen life can be best 
fitted by lognormal distribution for all three data 
sets. Finally, the mean of m  and mean of C  
in Paris law obtained from linear regression of 
crack growth rate versus stress intensity factor 
range both increase as stress ratio R increases.

1. Introduction 
Metal fatigue is a process that causes failure or 
damage of components or structures subjected 
to time-varying loadings. It is a very complicated 
metallurgical process and is difficult to describe 
and model accurately. In spite of its complexities, 
fatigue damage assessment for the design of 
components or structures still has to be made. 
As a result, fatigue analysis methods have been 
developed in the past decades. Based on the 
engineering and macroscopic viewpoints, the 
mechanical properties of material are often 
considered homogeneous. However, fatigue 
experimental data tested even under the same 
loading and environmental conditions with 
specimens cut from the same sheet show 
considerable amount of statistical variability. The 
scattered result is attributed to the 
inhomogeneous material microstructure itself. 
Therefore, such a scatter should be taken into 
account appropriately in the analysis and design 
of fatigue-critical components or structures. So 
far, many researchers have carried out studies in 
this aspect [1-8]. This scatter of fatigue data is 
now commonly regarded as an inherent feature 
of fatigue process in materials and rises 
conviction that deterministic methods cannot be 
adequately used in describing the fatigue 
behavior. Consequently, probabilistic approaches 
for the fatigue of material have received great 
attention and different stochastic fatigue crack 
growth models have been proposed to 
characterize the scatter of fatigue [9-15]. 
However, many of the proposed stochastic crack 
growth models are either lack of experimental 
verification or just verified by only one data set 
probably because there are only a few data sets 
available in the literature and it is rather 
time-consuming to carry out statistically 
meaningful experimental fatigue crack growth 
data sets. Moreover, experimental data obtained 
from testing specimens under various loading 
conditions constitute the main source of 
information about fatigue of materials. It seems 
 4
3.3 Comparison of coefficient of variation 
The coefficients of variation (COV) of initiation 
life, propagation life, and specimen life for all 
three data sets can be easily obtained from data 
described in section 3.1 and section 3.2. It is 
found that the coefficient of variation of 
initiation life is the largest and coefficient of 
variation of specimen life is the smallest for all 
three data sets. The results are demonstrated in 
Fig. 7. 
 
3.4 NS −  curve 
The nominal stresses applied to fatigue crack 
growth experiments are sinusoidal stress of 
4082.70peak =σ  MPa and 1226.21trough =σ  
MPa, 4082.70peak =σ MPa and 
0408.7trough =σ MPa, and 4082.70peak =σ  
MPa and 0.0trough =σ  MPa for stress ratio 
R=0.3, R=0.1, and R=0.0, respectively. In terms 
of amplitude, the stress amplitudes are 
6428.24amp =σ  MPa, 6837.31amp =σ  MPa, 
and 2041.35amp =σ  MPa for R=0.3, R=0.1, 
and R=0.0, respectively. By using the data of 
specimen lives and stress amplitudes, the NS −  
curve can be constructed and the result is shown 
in Fig. 8. It is noted that the data was depicted 
on a log-log scale and the larger circle marks 
represent the median values of specimen lives. 
The negative linear correlation between median 
value of specimen life and stress amplitude can 
be seen from Fig. 8. The distribution of specimen 
life was also investigated by using both 
chi-square goodness-of -fit and probability 
plotting. It is found that the specimen life is best 
fitted by lognormal distribution for all three data 
sets and the results of lognormal probability 
paper for three data sets are shown in Fig. 9. 
 
3.5 Crack growth rate vs. stress intensity 
factor range 
The experimental fatigue crack growth data 
shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3 provide the 
source to calculate the crack growth rate 
dN
da and stress intensity factor range dK . The 
results of crack growth rate versus stress 
intensity factor range for three data sets are 
demonstrated in Fig. 10, where the crack growth 
rates were calculated by the seven-point 
incremental polynomial method as suggested by 
ASTM standard E647-91 [16]. The solid lines in 
Fig. 10 indicate the results of linear regression of 
dN
da
 versus dK , where the slope and 
intercept of regression line represent the mean 
value of exponent m and the mean value of log 
of coefficient C  in Paris law, respectively. It is 
found that the fitted regression line moves from 
lower right to upper left as stress ratio R 
increases. The correlations between stress ratio 
R and mean of m , and stress ratio R and mean 
of C  are shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, 
respectively. From Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, it is 
found that the mean of m  and mean of C  
both increase as stress ratio R increases. The 
correlation coefficient between stress ratio R and 
mean of m  is 0.94200, and correlation 
coefficient between stress ratio R and mean of 
C  is 0.99177. 
 
4. Concluding Remarks 
Three fatigue crack growth data sets of 
2024-T351 aluminum-alloy specimens are 
presented in the present paper. Statistical 
analysis is performed on those data sets. With 
regard to the statistical nature of fatigue, the 
following comments are made. 
1. The inhomogeneity of material does cause 
the scatter of fatigue crack growth, and the 
degree of scatter may be considerably large. 
2. The mean and standard deviation of crack 
initiation life both increase as stress ratio R 
increases. 
3. The means and standard deviations of both 
propagation life and specimen life increase 
as stress ration R increases. 
4. Among initiation life, propagation life, and 
specimen life, the coefficient of variation of 
initiation life is the largest and coefficient of 
variation of specimen life is the smallest for 
all three data sets. 
5. The median value of specimen life and 
stress amplitude is negative linear
