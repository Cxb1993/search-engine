The polar transmitter architecture is more suitable for implementing a multi-standard transmitter 
than the conventional Cartesian transmitter architecture. Many attempts have been made in the past to 
develop multi-standard transmitters using this architecture. However, the bandwidths of those 
implementations have been limited. Another major bottleneck for the polar transmitter has been its 
limited dynamic range. For modern cell phone standards that utilize a wide dynamic power control range 
to maintain high spectral efficiency and a wide bandwidth to achieve high data throughput, the polar 
transmitter architecture has to be improved to support those standards. We propose a modified polar 
transmitter architecture using a multi-bit, multi-phase switching mechanism at the input of the power 
amplifier to address this problem. Using this modified architecture, the low-pass filter in the envelope 
path can be eliminated and make it easier to achieve a wider bandwidth. Moreover, by moving the polar 
modulation mechanism from the drain or collector of the power amplifier to its input, a low-frequency 
DC-DC converter can be placed there to control the average output power, which may increase the 
dynamic range. This new polar transmitter architecture will make it possible to implement a 
multi-standard wide dynamic range radio-frequency transmitter.  
The proposed research first developed a simulation platform and then implemented a board-level 
system prototype such that a thorough understanding of the proposed architecture can be gained. The 
research next designed the major components of the dynamic power control system using TSMC 0.18um 
CMOS process. Finally, the implemented module was evaluated with the other sub-projects for the 2nd 
and 3rd generation cellular phone standards. The overall system was able to pass the required spectral 
specifications and had significant efficiency enhancements.

 
Modern wireless communication standards often employ power control methods to improve spectral 
efficiency. With power control, the PA is often backed-off from its peak power level. To make things 
worse, communication standards utilizing complex modulation schemes with varying envelope requires 
the PA to be backed off even further by its peak-to-average ratio (PAR). These scenarios make designing 
power efficient PAs even harder since efficiency is not only important at peak power, but also at 
backed-off power levels. Several methods have been proposed over the years to improve PA efficiency 
[1]. The proposed research seeks to develop a modified EER-based polar transmitter architecture, which 
uses a multi-bit, multi-phase oversampling technique shown in Fig. 1. This research seeks to combine the 
benefits of removing the envelope path low-pass filter shown in [2-3] and use a multi-bit, multi-phase 
technique shown by the authors in [4] to greatly widen the bandwidth. The first part of this sub-project 
seeks to evaluate the proposed architecture‚Äôs performance by means of system simulation. This is a 
preliminary step in implementing an actual multi-standard polar transmitter chip. The result will lead to 
the specification definition of each block that comprises the polar modulator and greatly reduce the 
overall design time. The defined specifications will be used by the other sub-projects for actual circuit 
design and implementation. This simulation platform will also be used later by the designer of each block 
to verify its performance and its implication to the overall system behavior. The second part of this 
sub-project seeks to solve the aforementioned dynamic range problem widely seen in EER-based polar 
transmitter architectures. Conventional EER-based polar transmitter architectures use the dynamic power 
supply circuit or envelope amplifier to control both the instantaneous power (envelope) and average 
power. The average power range of CDMA and W-CDMA standards can be as high as 80 dB, which 
cannot be achieved with conventional polar transmitters. The proposed architecture moved the 
instantaneous power control to the input of the RF PA and freed up the drain or collector of the PA. This 
modification makes this architecture compatible with power-level tracking power amplifiers. Therefore, a 
high-efficiency DC-DC converter can be used to control the average output power of the power amplifier. 
To further increase the usable dynamic range, a VGA can be added in front of the mixers. The block 
diagram of the proposed polar transmitter with the improved average power control block is shown in Fig. 
1. 
The proposed research targets the construction of a complete highly-efficient multi-standard polar 
transmitter system that can support most of the widely used mobile wireless communication standards 
such as GSM, EDGE, CDMA, W-CDMA, and HSPA. A mobile wireless communication device utilizing 
this transmitter should have much longer battery life and significantly lower cost than conventional ones. 
It would also be more convenient for the device user since it would not require the user to change devices

Multi-Standard Cell Phones 
Current cell phones on the market that support tri-mode (GSM/EDGE/W-CDMA) and quad-band 
(850/900/1800/1900) can require as many as seven power amplifiers and transmit chains if conventional 
IQ-modulation, shown in Fig. 2, is used. Such requirement is mainly because of the vast difference in 
baseband bandwidths between standards and vast difference in carrier frequencies. The difference in 
baseband bandwidths can require multiple baseband anti-aliasing filters after the digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC). Whereas the difference in carrier frequencies leads to the requirement of different 
mixers, frequency synthesizers, variable gain amplifiers (VGA) and RF power amplifiers. The 
requirement of multiple power amplifiers and transmit chains is a major obstacle for reducing the cost and 
increasing the efficiency of multi-standard cell phones.

Recent improvements in power amplifier design made it possible to integrate the GSM and the 
EDGE power amplifiers. Such improvement reduced the number of power amplifiers to five [1]. 
However, for cell phones that require IS-95 CDMA standard to be supported along with GSM, the 
number of power amplifiers and transmit chains would need to increase again. To make things even 
worse, power amplifiers and transmitters that support current communication standards are not 
compatible with the fourth generation (4G) mobile wireless communication standards such as Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) and WiMax. To support all of the widely used communication standards and implement 
a true ‚Äúworld phone‚Äù is highly challenging. To this date, such kind of ‚Äúworld phone‚Äù still does not exist 
and frequent travelers around the world must carry multiple cell phones while travelling, which is highly 
inconvenient. 
Polar Transmitter as a Solution for Multi-Standard Operation 
The EDGE standard started to gain popularity in the past few years when the GSM/GPRS standard 
was not able to quench the thirst for higher data rates. The EDGE standard utilized 3√£/8-shifted 8-PSK, 
which is a non-constant envelope modulation. Unlike GMSK used in GSM/GPRS standard, 3√£/8-shifted

Modified polar transmitter techniques try to eliminate the low-pass filter in the envelope path to 
reduce the delay mismatch between the phase and the envelope path as in [13-14]. The removal of the 
low-pass filter in the envelope path can eliminate the frequency dependent gain problem seen in wideband 
supply modulators. Moreover, it can also greatly reduce the component size of the envelope path since the 
passive inductor and capacitor take up a significant portion of the PCB area. 
The implementation in [13] used a mixer in front a class-E PA to combine the envelope information 
and the phase information. A modulator in the form of PWM or SDM is used to digitize the envelope data 
to be combined with the phase data using a switch-mode mixer. The non-linear RF PA will either be on or 
off depending on the digital output of the modulator, which makes the operation very power-efficient. 
Since this implementation does not use a low-pass filter in the envelope path, aliasing components having 
integer multiples of the sampling frequency away from the carrier has to be filtered by a band-pass filter 
after the RF PA. For standards such as IS-95 CDMA and W-CDMA, such filter is already available in the 
form of a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) filter-based duplexer. SAW filters are known to have very good 
frequency selectivity and is able to remove such components easily [12]. This implementation solved the 
problem of delay mismatch between the phase and the envelope paths. However, the usable modulation 
bandwidth and dynamic range has a lot of room for improvements.

Development of Simulation Platform for Modified Polar Transmitters 
The proposed modified polar transmitter architecture is a mixed-signal system. A mixed-signal 
simulation platform has to be developed to simulate the proposed architecture in order to efficiently 
evaluate the overall system performance for various standards. Such platform must first be able to 
generate input signal for all the standards. Second, it must be able to pass such signal to various 
analog/RF blocks for time-domain simulation under SPICE. Then it must be able to take the time-domain 
simulation results and analyze the signal‚Äôs spectral content and demodulate it to measure the modulation 
accuracy. Conventional SPICE-like simulators like HSPICE, PSPICE, and Spectre are not suitable for 
generating modulated signals. Even if the modulated signals can be generated externally, the simulation 
results cannot be processed. Simulation results must be post-processed by software such as Matlab to 
evaluate the spectral contents and further demodulated for measurements of modulation accuracy. Matlab 
and other system level simulation software can generate the complex modulated signals and analyze the 
simulation results easily, but it is hard to accurately model circuit imperfections using Matlab and not a 
SPICE-like simulator. 
The first step of the proposed research is to set up a mixed-signal simulation platform for all of the 
previously mentioned standards using mixed-signal simulation software such as Mentor Graphics ADMS 
or Cadence AMS. The platform will first use ideal macro-model components, but will have the capability 
to switch in transistor-level blocks in the future. The platform will simplify the task of verifying 
transistor-level blocks designed by all sub-project participants in the future. After development of the 
platform, it will be used to simulate and evaluate the performance of the proposed modified polar 
transmitter architecture. Analog/RF macro-models will be used to model various analog/RF blocks in the 
transmitter chain. Physical imperfections, such as delay and mismatch, will be added to evaluate their 
effects to the overall transmitter performance. Spectral purity and modulation accuracy will be evaluated 
for all previously mentioned standards. Using the simulation results, performance specifications of each 
circuit block can be derived and passed on to all designers of each sub-project. 
Dynamic Range Improvement for Modified Polar Transmitters 
Dynamic range has always been an unsolved problem for EER-based polar transmitters. To maintain 
high spectral efficiency, cell phone power control is required so all data transmitted to the base station 
have approximately the same power level. For wireless standards such as IS-95 CDMA and W-CDMA, 
the dynamic power control range is required to be as much as 80 dB. However, conventional EER-based

Development of Simulation Platform for Modified Polar Transmitters 
To evaluate the overall system performance for various standards, a mixed-signal simulation 
platform is needed to be developed. In this project, the authors use Cadence AMS software for this 
purpose. The Cadence AMS software provides a hierarchy view that is able to link both the analog and 
the digital simulation seamlessly and also has the capability to exchange different views such as verilog, 
verilog-ams, calibre, and schematic for system evaluation. An 836.5 MHz W-CDMA signal is used to test 
the simulation platform. The proposed polar transmitter hierarchy view is depicted in Fig. 8. The main 
advantages of using the Cadence AMS are that the designer can obtain a balance between speed and 
accuracy and reduce the design cycle obviously. 
 
Fig. 8.  Block diagram of the simulation environment used in this work. 
Another benefit of the proposed polar transmitter is that the new architecture can use DACs with 
lower resolution rather than the conventional RF transmitter (approximately 14 bits), which significantly 
reduces chip area and cost. Simulations are performed using the implemented simulation platform with 
various standards. The resolution of DACs required for a transmitter used for a specific communication 
standard is normally limited by noise. Noise that leaks into channels next to the channel being used has 
the same effect as nonlinearity and is usually quantified using the adjacent channel power ratio. The

Multi-Level PWM for Pulse-Modulated Polar Transmitters 
To implement a wide dynamic range polar transmitter, the pulse-modulated polar transmitter 
architecture is chosen. However, the limited resolution may lead to unwanted spectral emission out of the 
desired transmission bandwidth. A multi-level PWM scheme is proposed to increase the resolution of 
pulse-modulated polar transmitters by implementing the polar transmitters as a DAC-like structure. The 
basic block diagram is shown in Fig. 9. Measurement results are shown in Fig. 10. This architecture is 
reported in [16].

Multi-Phase PWM for Pulse-Modulated Polar Transmitters 
Multi-phase PWM pulse-modulated polar transmitter was proposed as an improvement over 
multi-level PWM. Multi-phase PWM had the same benefit of increasing the resolution, but had a very 
useful feature of cancelling the nearby harmonics. The basic block diagram of the proposed architecture is 
shown in Fig. 11. Simulation of the multi-phase PWM with various numbers of phases is shown in Fig.

Wide Dynamic Range Polar Transmitters 
In order for a polar transmitter to achieve an 80-dB dynamic range, the architecture in Fig. 15 is 
proposed. The proposed polar transmitter uses a dc-dc converter to back-off at high power levels. Since a 
pulse modulated polar transmitter is used, the gate and drain power control can be separated and provide a 
higher degree of freedom. Thus a VGA can be used to adjust the output power levels when the power 
levels are low. Therefore, an 80-dB dynamic range can be achieved.

To show the benefits in linearity for the proposed architecture, the spectrum at peak output power 
level for both the proposed polar transmitter and a commercial PA are shown in Fig. 19. It can be seen 
that the polar transmitter is much more linear than a conventional linearly biased PA. Fig. 20 shows the 
wideband output spectrum of the pulse modulated polar transmitter. It can be seen that the harmonics 
from pulsing the signal can be filtered out by an external SAW filter already used in cell phones 
nowadays. This part of the work is reported in [18] and [19].

the mixers to mimic a VGA. Finally, a switch controlled by a pre-calculated envelope signal is used after 
the VGA to generate an RF pulse signal. In this IC, a digital gain/attenuation block is added to reduce the 
required dynamic range for the VGA and ease the design requirements. The block diagram of the overall 
polar transmitter is shown in Fig. 22.

The polar transmitter IC was implemented using TSMC 0.18 um process. The chip micrograph is 
shown in Fig. 23. The chip was packaged in a plastic QFN44 package. A printed circuit board (PCB) was 
implemented to interface the polar transmitter chip with the FPGA board and external PAs. To test the 
implemented system, the test vectors of the phase signal and pulsed envelope signal were loaded into the 
FPGA memory and then sent to the DAC inputs and switch inputs of the implemented chip. A 
programmable linear power supply was used to mimic a dc-dc converter to implement the power-level 
tracking PA. The overall transmitter was then evaluated with a spectrum analyzer. The measurement

the CDMA2000 standard can be met. The margin is less than expected compared to the results of the 
previous subsection. The degradation comes from the inadequate isolation provided by a two-layer PCB 
for measuring the polar transmitter IC. This part of the project is reported in [20].

A Multi-Level Pulse Modulated Polar Transmitter
Using Digital Pulse-Width Modulation
Jau-Horng Chen, Member, IEEE, Hao-Shun Yang, Student Member, IEEE, and
Yi-Jan Emery Chen, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract‚ÄîThis letter presents a multi-level pulse modulated
polar transmitter architecture. Compared to a conventional
gate-modulated envelope elimination and restoration trans-
mitter, the use of the proposed technique is capable of reducing
the in-band quantization noise level. Moreover, the proposed
technique can increase the pulse-width modulation sampling
frequency by relaxing its resolution requirement, which eases
the filtering requirement at the output. A prototype transmitter
system is constructed using commercially available components.

I. INTRODUCTION
T HE envelope elimination and restoration (EER) techniqueis a method that uses highly nonlinear, but highly efficient
radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) as a modulator to
restore the amplitude on a phase modulated input signal [1].
The basic block diagram of a conventional EER transmitter is
shown in Fig. 1. Conventional EER transmitters use highly effi-
cient switched-mode amplifiers, or envelope amplifiers, to mod-
ulate the collector or drain of a nonlinear RF PA. Recently, a
modified EER architecture has been reported in [2]‚Äì[4], which
uses a switch or mixer to modulate the input signal of the RF
PA. The main benefit of this approach is the removal of the en-
velope amplifier, which is hard to design with wide bandwidth
and high output power level. However, a high-quality band-pass
filter (BPF) is required at the output of the RF PA to suppress the
out-of-band emissions created by the modulator. A basic block
diagram of the modified EER architecture is shown in Fig. 2.
In this letter, we demonstrate the use of multi-level pulse
modulation for polar transmitters. By using multi-levels in con-
junction with digital pulse-width modulation (DPWM), the ef-
fective resolution of the envelope signal can be increased. The

increase of the PWM resolution makes it possible to increase
the switching frequency of the DPWM for a fixed clock rate,
which makes it easier for the output BPF to remove the un-
wanted out-of-band emissions.
II. MULTI-LEVEL DIGITAL PULSE-WIDTH MODULATION
The pulse modulation of the input signal of a polar transmitter
can be realized using pulse-width modulation (PWM). Because
of the sampling nature of PWM, the signal reconstructed by the
pulse modulated polar transmitter may have unwanted out-of-
band emissions at multiples of the PWM switching frequencies
away from the carrier frequency. The characteristics of the har-
monics have been discussed in detail in [3].
For wide bandwidth applications, conventional analog PWM
may not be sufficiently linear such that additional pre-distor-
tion may be required for implementing the polar transmitter.
With the advancement of modern digital CMOS technology,
it is now possible to implement DPWM using high clock rate
digital counters. If a digital counter runs at a clock rate of
and counts to a maximum of , the counter can then generate
a PWM signal with sampling frequency, , of ,
which has different pulse widths. For pulse modulated
polar transmitters, it is desirable to have a high such
that out-of-band emissions can be sufficiently filtered by ex-
ternal BPF at the output of the RF PA. For a constant , a
higher leads to a lower and effectively reduces the
resolution of the envelope signal. A lower resolution will lead
to a higher noise level, which may cause the polar transmitter to
fail certain spurious emission requirements.

require long delays in the phase path using digital memory or a
linear-phase filter, the implementation of the pulse modulated
polar transmitter is less complex.
To assess the benefit of improved out-of-band emission by
using the proposed technique to increase the PWM sampling
frequency and to increase effective resolution, the wideband
spectrums of the unfiltered and the filtered signals are shown and
compared in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the surface-acoustic-wave
(SAW) filter widely used in cellular phone transmitters does not
have high attenuation within 20 MHz of the carrier frequency.
With the use of the proposed technique, it was possible to have a
PWM sampling frequency of 37.5 MHz. The high sampling fre-
quency made it possible for the SAW BPF to sufficiently reduce
the largest out-of-band emission components that are 37.5 MHz
away from the carrier frequency. The filtered spectrum was able
to pass the spurious emission requirement for band class 0 (cel-
lular band) of the CDMA2000 standard defined in [6].
V. CONCLUSION
A multi-level pulse modulated polar transmitter is proposed.
To verify the proposed architecture, a highly efficient and
highly linear polar transmitter using a dual-level DPWM ar-
chitecture for CDMA2000 1X applications was designed and
implemented. Using an 836.5 MHz CDMA2000 1X signal, the
proposed polar transmitter system was able to pass the stringent
ACPR requirements for both the adjacent and alternate chan-
nels of the CDMA2000 standard with an output power level
of 24.5 dBm while achieving a PAE of 40.2%. With the use of
a commercially available SAW BPF, the polar transmitter was
able to pass the spurious emission requirement for band class
0 of the CDMA2000 standard.

in [21] due to the loss incurred from using a linear PA and a
wideband envelope amplifier.
II. THEORY OF OPERATION
The EER technique has been a proven technique that is ca-
pable of improving the efficiency of the PA at power levels close
to the maximum output power. Demonstrations for various stan-
dards with efficiencies in the 50% region have been reported in
[7]‚Äì[10]. However, when operating under back off, the envelope
amplifier must still operate under full speed, which degrades the
overall efficiency. As a result, the efficiency of a conventional
EER transmitter for wide bandwidth applications may drop al-
most as much as a linear PA under back off. The PAs for modern
communication standards rarely operate close to the maximum
output power level. Therefore, to achieve high peak efficiency
and high average efficiency at the same time, a polar transmitter
using concurrent dynamic supply modulation and input pulse
modulation is proposed. The proposed transmitter seeks to com-
bine the benefits of both a conventional EER transmitter and a
PT PA.
For a conventional EER transmitter, the output signal
can be expressed as
(1)
where is the envelope signal, is the
up-converted RF phase signal, is the gain of the RF PA
that is dependent on the envelope signal, and is the mag-
nitude of the RF phase signal. For an ideal EER transmitter,
is completely linear. However, in an actual implemen-
tation, becomes highly nonlinear when approaches
the knee voltage of the RF power transistor. As a result, con-
ventional EER transmitters may require digital pre-distortion or
calibration for communication standards with zero-crossing sig-
nals or when highly backed off.
For the modified EER transmitter used in this work, the output
signal after filtering can be expressed as
(2)
where is the gain of the RF PA that is dependent on
the supply voltage from the dc‚Äìdc converter, and ,
the magnitude of the RF phase signal. Unlike a conventional
EER transmitter, the supply voltage does not change with re-
spect to the instantaneous power level of the signal being trans-
mitted. Therefore, the proposed transmitter does not have lin-
earity concerns even when the supply voltage drops below the
knee voltage. However, it is still desirable to keep the supply
voltage over the knee voltage to ensure a positive PA power
gain. Equation (2) also suggests that the average power level
control using and can be completely separated from
the instantaneous power control using , as proposed in this
paper.
III. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
The proposed polar transmitter uses an on‚Äìoff modulator to
generate a pulse-modulated constant-envelope RF signal, which
is phase modulated by the polar phase of the in-phase/quadra-
ture (IQ) signals, to control the instantaneous output power with
Fig. 3. Block diagram of the proposed wide dynamic-range pulse-modulated
polar transmitter.
high efficiency. The on‚Äìoff modulator is controlled by a digital
pulsewidth modulator (DPWM). The duty cycle of the DPWM
signal is generated by the polar magnitude or envelope of the
IQ signals. Therefore, the pulse-modulated constant-envelope
RF signal can be amplified by a highly efficient PA. The de-
sired RF signal is restored by filtering out the harmonics of the
pulse-modulated signal coming out of the RF PA using a BPF.
Since the drain of the PA is freed from using the pulse-mod-
ulated architecture, the supply can then be adjusted according
to the average power level like a PT PA using a conventional
highly efficient dc‚Äìdc converter. The block diagram of the pro-
posed transmitter architecture is shown in Fig. 3.
The dynamic range of the pulse-modulated polar transmitter
achieved by adjusting the supply voltage can be predicted as
dB (3)
where and are the maximum and minimum
supply voltages applied to the RF PA, respectively. For this im-
plementation, V and V; there-
fore, the power control of the pulse-modulated polar transmitter
is about 11 dB. To meet the 80-dB power control requirement
of the CDMA2000 or W-CDMA standards, the magnitude of
the constant-envelope RF signal is controlled by a variable gain
amplifier (VGA) before entering the on‚Äìoff modulator.
A detailed schematic of the RF PA, the dc‚Äìdc converter, and
the RF switch in Fig. 3 is shown in Fig. 4. The input RF phase
signal is first split by a power splitter before entering a pair of RF
switches. The pair of commercially available switches [22] is in-
ternally matched to 50 , is connected to the input of a pair of
two-stage PAs, and is used to modulate the constant envelope RF
input signal. The pair of two-stage PAs uses commercially avail-
able cascaded enhancement-mode pseudomorphic high electron
mobility transistors (PHEMTs) [23] biased slightly above the
threshold voltage to operate under class AB. The output power
of the pair of two-stage PAs was then combined using a power
combiner. When close to the peak power level, the RF PAs are
highly overdriven such that the PAs are switching to increase ef-
ficiency. Using a single-tone signal at 836.5 MHz, the two-stage
PA delivered over 29 dBm of output power with over 20 dB of
gain and 74% power-added efficiency (PAE). The dc‚Äìdc con-
verter is constructed using a commercially available high-ef-
ficiency synchronous Buck converter operating with a 1-MHz

V. CONCLUSIONS
A technique for implementing wide dynamic-range polar
transmitters has been proposed. Using the technique, a highly
efficient wide dynamic-range polar transmitter for cellular-band
CDMA2000 1 application is designed and implemented.
Using a pulse-modulated polar transmitter architecture and
dynamic drain biasing concurrently, wide dynamic range for
a polar transmitter can be achieved without compromising
efficiency and linearity. The proposed polar transmitter system
is experimentally verified to pass the stringent ACPR re-
quirements for both the adjacent and alternate channels of
the CDMA2000 standard for the entire 80-dB power control
range at 836.5 MHz. Measurement results have also shown the
proposed transmitter to be more than five times better than a
fixed bias commercial linear PA in average efficiency.

An Efficiency-Improved Outphasing Power
Amplifier Using RF Pulse Modulation
Jau-Horng Chen, Member, IEEE
Abstract‚ÄîThis letter presents a method for improving the
efficiency of an outphasing amplifier by pulse modulating the
input signals. By pulse modulating the two input signals to the
outphasing amplifier, the outphasing angle can be kept small
and hence attain higher efficiency. Whereas, compared to a
pulse modulated polar transmitter, the need for high resolution
pulsewidth modulation is reduced. To validate the proposed
technique, a prototype transmitter system is constructed using
commercially available components. Using a CDMA2000 1X
signal at 836.5 MHz, the proposed technique achieved a 26%
improvement in power-added efficiency compared to a conven-
tional outphasing amplifier at 25.2 dBm output power level while
passing the adjacent and alternate channel power ratios for the
CDMA2000 standard.

I. INTRODUCTION
T HE outphasing power amplifier (PA) is capable of linearpower amplification using highly efficient nonlinear PAs
[1], [2]. Several recent works on the outphasing PA have been
focused on improving its power efficiency using a multilevel ar-
chitecture such as [3]‚Äì[5]. Through the use of multiple levels of
constant envelope signals by using dc-dc converters, the out-
phasing angle of the outphasing PA can be kept small such
that the power efficiency can be increased. The envelope elim-
ination and restoration (EER) technique is also a method that
uses highly nonlinear, but highly efficient PAs to perform linear
power amplification. Recently, a modified EER architecture has
been reported in [6], [7], which used a switch to modulate the
input signal of the RF PA to create RF pulses such that the im-
plementation of an EER PA can be simplified.
In this letter, the use of RF pulse modulation shown in [6], [7]
to improve the efficiency of the outphasing PA is demonstrated.
The concurrent use of both the modified EER technique using
RF pulse modulation and the outphasing technique can also re-
duce the resolution requirement of the RF pulses discussed in
[7]. The reduction of the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) reso-
lution requirements makes it possible to increase the switching

makes it easier for the output band-pass filter (BPF) to remove

II. HYBRID OUTPHASING/MODIFIED EER
Any complex modulated signal can be written in the polar
form of
(1)
where is the envelope information, is the carrier fre-
quency, and is the phase information. For an EER PA, the
envelope and the RF phase can be amplified separately with effi-
cient components for high overall efficiency. For an outphasing
PA, the complex modulated signal is separated into
(2)
(3)
The two signals are first amplified separately and then com-
bined through a power combiner. In this work, a hybrid out-
phasing/modified EER is proposed for improving the efficiency
of a conventional outphasing PA. The envelope information,
, is first processed such that

where is a parameter used to control the amount of envelope
information to be processed by outphasing or EER. The input
signals to be amplified by the two paths of the outphasing PA
are then calculated as

the spectral mask defined in [10] are compared in Fig. 6. The
measurement results show that the proposed method improves
the overall efficiency at the expense of less ACPR margin. The
matching characteristics of the RF PAs used to construct the
efficiency-improved outphasing PA were sufficient. Therefore,
digital calibration and pre-distortion were not necessary. The
proposed architecture is also compatible with other efficiency
improvement schemes for the outphasing PA, such as the use of
a Chiereix power combiner in [11] or the power reuse technique
proposed in [12].
One of the major drawbacks of introducing switching to RF
circuits is the potential of creating undesirable spurious emis-
sions. However, all current cell phones have surface-acoustic-
wave (SAW) filters between the PAs and the antennas to pass
the receive band noise requirements defined by various commu-
nication standards. In this work, with the switching frequency
sufficiently high, the spur can be adequately filtered with com-
mercially available SAW filters. The wideband spectrums of the
unfiltered and the filtered signals are shown and compared in
Fig. 7. It can be seen that the spurs created by the 30 MHz
PWM sampling frequency was possible for the SAW BPF to
sufficiently suppress. The filtered spectrum was able to pass the
spurious emission requirement for the CDMA2000 standard.
Compared to the work in [6], [7], the envelope information is
not processed solely by the switches, which made it possible to
increase the PWM sampling frequency and ease the filtering re-
quirements. If pure RF pulse modulation was used as in the case
of , the low resolution provided by the PWM would not
be sufficient to pass the ACPR spectral requirements.
V. CONCLUSION
A method for improving the efficiency of outphasing am-
plifier with little added circuitry is proposed. To verify the
proposed architecture, a prototype system using commercially
available components was designed and implemented. Using
an 836.5 MHz CDMA2000 1X signal with 4.5 dB PAPR, the
proposed polar transmitter system was able to pass the stringent
ACPR requirements for both the adjacent and alternate chan-
nels of the CDMA2000 standard with an output power level of
25.2 dBm. Through the use of the proposed method, the PAE
is improved from 24.2% to 30.6%, which is an improvement
of 26% over the conventional outphasing PA. The proposed
method is also compatible with previously reported efficient
power combining technique and power reuse technique, which
can further improve the efficiency of outphasing PAs. With the
use of a commercially available SAW BPF, the polar trans-
mitter was able to pass the spurious emission requirement for
the CDMA2000 standard.

iters to separate the RF phase signal. Owing to the advancement
of modern digital-signal-processor technology, it is now pos-
sible to directly generate the envelope and phase signals digi-
tally to implement a polar transmitter, which significantly eases
the implementation. These EER-based polar transmitters have
been demonstrated in [17]‚Äì[20]. To further simplify the digital
polar-transmitter architecture, the previously mentioned pulse
modulation can be used on the RF phase signal of the trans-
mitter. This paper presents a multiphase pulse-modulated dig-
ital polar transmitter, as shown in Fig. 3, which addresses the
aforementioned problems in the EER architecture. By utilizing
the pulse-modulation technique, the delay in the digital polar
transmitter based on the Kahn EER technique can be easily syn-
chronized. Moreover, the use of a multiphase pulsewidth mod-
ulation (PWM) technique increases the effective sampling fre-
quency, which removes the nearby unwanted out-of-band spu-
rious emissions, and has the potential of eliminating the BPF at
the output with little added circuit complexity.
II. MULTIPHASE PWM
The multiphase PWM technique is used in conjunction with
pulse-modulated polar transmitters to reduce spurious noise. An
example of a multiphase PWM signal is shown in Fig. 4. For
a conventional symmetric PWM, it was shown in [28] that a
single-phase PWM pulse train with duty cycle of can be ex-
pressed using Fourier series as
(1)
where is the PWM sampling frequency and
(2)
Fig. 4. Example of multiphase PWM showing the increased effective sampling
rate.
Using the previous information, a multiphase system with
phases and normalized output power can then be expressed
using the average of equally delayed single-phase pulse
trains as
(3)
where
(4)
which can be simplified as
(5)
The detailed derivation of (5) is described in the Appendix.
With the use of the multiphase technique, the nearby har-
monic components ( to ) resulting from the sam-
pling of the PWM can be removed and ease the filtering require-
ments. Therefore, for an -phase pulse-modulated polar trans-
mitter with each phase properly matched, only the th har-
monics will remain, where is an integer. The th harmonic
is located at
(6)
where is the carrier frequency. Pulse modulation of the input
signal using PWM was mentioned in [23] but was concluded as
unattractive since the intermodulation terms and spurious emis-
sions were too high. With the use of the multiphase technique
in this paper, such unwanted spurious emissions can be greatly
reduced. The authors have recently reported a multilevel PWM
approach for implementing a pulse-modulated EER transmitter
in [29]. The use of multiple levels increases the effective resolu-
tion of the PWM, whereas the use of multiphase PWM increases
not only the effective resolution through oversampling but also
reduces the harmonic components. Moreover, implementation
of an -level PWM system and an -phase PWM system have
similar complexity. Therefore, the multiphase PWM approach
can be viewed as an improvement over the multilevel PWM ap-
proach.
The derivations leading to (5) assume the duty cycle to
be constant for simplicity. However, for a time-dependent
duty cycle , the previous conclusions are seen to be
also valid and are validated through computer simulations.

The case of is different when all switches are off, since
the transmitter delivers zero RF power while consuming zero
dc power. Two examples of the efficiency calculation for a two-
phase system are also shown in Figs. 7 and 8 to validate
the derivation of (15) and (16), where and are the two
outputs of two PAs and is the output of the power combiner.
To calculate the overall efficiency, the probability density
function of the envelope signal is required. The average drain
efficiency can then be defined as
(17)
where is the probability of the PWM duty cycle . For
this work, a CDMA2000 1X signal was used, and the histogram
of the signal is shown in Fig. 9.
In the previous section, it was shown that the pulsed-modu-
lated polar transmitter creates unwanted out-of-band emissions
at multiples of away from the carrier frequency. The
efficiency estimated previously used the total output power
for calculation, which is inaccurate since it includes unwanted
out-of-band emissions. To estimate the actual efficiency, the
unwanted harmonics must then be removed using the data in

was measured by tying all four class-C PAs together. Using this
method, the three signals can be fairly compared at the same
output power level.
To validate the cancellation of harmonics in multiphase
pulse-modulated polar transmitters, the wideband spectra with
a frequency span of 200 MHz was measured and compared in
Figs. 14 and 15. The comparisons show that the harmonics does
reduce with the use of the multiphase technique. However, the
reduction is unlike the simulated results shown previously in
Fig. 5. The discrepancy is mainly because of the mismatch be-
tween the phases. Better suppression can be achieved with better
matching within the circuit. Even without perfect matching, the
suppression will significantly ease the requirements of the BPF
used at the output of the pulse-modulated polar transmitter.
To show the benefits of using the proposed architecture
as opposed to a conventional linear PA, the efficiency of the
proposed four-phase transmitter was measured and compared
with a commercially available CDMA2000 PA for a range
of power levels. The comparison is shown in Fig. 16. The
measurement results show significant advantage in efficiency
when backed off, as in the conventional EER transmitters
previously reported. Table III summarizes the drain efficiency,
PAE, and error-vector magnitude performances of the prototype
transmitter. Measurements were performed at the output of the
power combiner using a CDMA2000 1X signal. The measured

phase pulse-modulated polar transmitters with a center frequency of 836.5 MHz.

phase pulse-modulated polar transmitters with a center frequency of 836.5 MHz.
PAE is approximately equal to the simulated results. The small
difference between the measured efficiency and the simulated
efficiency is caused by the narrow bandwidth of the PA itself,
which actually suppresses some unwanted harmonics such
that less power is wasted. Therefore, the measured efficiency
can be greater than the overly pessimistic estimated efficiency,
particularly for lower number of phases. An example showing
the suppression from an actual PA can be seen in Fig. 17.
The downward trend of the measured efficiency shown in
Table III is also a result of the narrow bandwidth of the PA.
With fewer phases, more power would have been wasted from
the harmonics if the PA was wideband.
VI. CONCLUSION
A multiphase pulse-modulated polar transmitter based on the
Kahn EER technique has been demonstrated. The combination
of the pulse-modulation technique and the multiphase PWM
technique enables the transmitter to have less out-of-band emis-
sion without the use of digital predistortion. A four-phase pro-
totype implementation was constructed to evaluate the perfor-

Abstract‚ÄîThis paper presents a highly efficient polar trans-
mitter using interleaving pulse modulation for multiple com-
munication standards. Using the proposed interleaving pulse
modulation technique, a polar transmitter can suppress the
odd-order output spurs deeply with a feasible value of essential
sampling frequency and keep the residual spurs from falling into
the receive bands. To validate the proposed technique, a prototype
polar transmitter was constructed and evaluated. Using global
system for mobile communications, enhanced data rates for GSM
evolution, and wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA)
signals at 836.5 MHz, the polar transmitter achieved 68%, 45.5%,
and 41.2% power-added efficiency at output power levels of 28, 26,
and 25 dBm, respectively. The measurement results were able to
pass the spectral requirements defined by the respective standards
without the use of any pre-distortion or calibration techniques.
Moreover, the polar transmitter was able to achieve an output
dynamic range of 80 dB required by the WCDMA standard.

I. INTRODUCTION
T HE CELLULAR phones that support multiple com-munication standards such as global system for mobile
communications (GSM), enhanced data rates for GSM evo-
lution (EDGE), and wideband code division multiple access
(WCDMA) require different power amplifier (PA) modules for
each standard [1]. The GSM/EDGE combo PA module devel-
oped in [2] enabled dual-standard operation, but at the expense
of low EDGE mode efficiency to meet linearity requirements.
The stringent linearity requirement of EDGE results from
the use of a nonconstant envelope modulation unlike the
constant-envelope modulation used in GSM. In recent years,
WCDMA has started to gain popularity because of the need of

higher data-rate transmission. The WCDMA standard also uses
a nonconstant envelope modulation similar to EDGE, but with
a much wider bandwidth, which leads to yet another PA if the
WCDMA standard is to be supported by the cellular phone.
To reduce the overall cost of multimode cellular phones, it
is highly desirable to have PAs that support multiple communi-
cation standards while maintaining high efficiency at the same
time. Digital pre-distortion for the linear PAs that supported
EDGE and WCDMA was successfully demonstrated in [3].
However, pre-distortion normally leads to increased power
consumption and circuit complexity while suffering from the
inherent low efficiency of linear PAs. The envelope elimination
and restoration (EER) technique proposed by Kahn is capable
of high-efficiency linear amplification [4]. Its adaptations
for highly efficient multimode PAs have been demonstrated in
[5]‚Äì[7], but require the use of feedback, digital pre-distortion, or
calibration. Moreover, the separation of the phase and envelope
signals in the EER technique required accurate synchronization
to avoid unwanted out-of-band emission, as shown in [8]. The
envelope-tracking (ET) technique demonstrated in [9] and
[10] has potential for multimode operation, but requires wide
bandwidth supply circuits as in EER and has lower efficiency
because of the use of linear PAs.
The pulse-modulated polar transmitter (PMPT), a modifica-
tion of EER, demonstrated in [11]‚Äì[15], has shown the fol-
lowing advantages over conventional EER:
1) easy synchronization of envelope and phase paths;
2) supply voltage does not need to track the instantaneous
envelope of the complex-modulated signal;
3) wide output power range.
This paper presents a PMPT using interleaving pulsewidth mod-
ulation (PWM) with a well-chosen PWM sampling frequency
for GSM/EDGE/WCDMA multimode cellular applications to
keep the spurs from falling into the receive bands. Through in-
terleaving pulse modulation, the odd harmonics of the inherent
pulse spurs can be cancelled to ease the filtering requirements
for signal restoration. To validate the proposed techniques, a
prototype system was constructed and evaluated. The measure-
ment results show that the proposed PMPT can attain excel-
lent power-added efficiency (PAE) for all supported standards
at peak power and under back off while meeting spectral re-
quirements. In addition, the PMPT can achieve an output power
dynamic range of 80 dB using the technique previously reported
in [14], which is required for the WCDMA application [16].

mitter, and its block diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The digital

The advantage of interleaving pulse modulation becomes ob-
vious by examining (9). The pulse spurs associated with the
pulse modulation happen only at the even multiples of the PWM
sampling frequency. The closest spurs to the carrier are pushed
away so the spur filtering becomes easier and more effective.
In addition, the spur amplitude, , decreases rapidly as in-
creases, as shown in (7).
The vector diagrams of the intermodulation of the interleaved
PWM signals and carrier are shown in Fig. 5. The second-order
intermodulation products will disappear because they are 180
out-of-phase. The third-order intermodulation products will re-
main because they are rotated to align in-phase. Similarly, the
fourth intermodulation products will disappear because they are
rotated to be 180 out-of-phase again. Therefore, the pulse mod-
ulation spurs appear only at the even multiples of the PWM sam-
pling frequency offset from the transmitting carrier for the polar
transmitter using two-way interleaving pulse modulation.
Unlike the interleaving pulse modulation technique, the
previously reported multilevel pulse modulation technique in-
creases the effective PWM modulation resolution by doubling
signal levels through power combining [12]. Although the two
PWM signals, and , used in [12], have different
duty cycles, they are in-phase instead of 180 time-interleaving.

and carrier.

Therefore, the pulse spurs associated with the multilevel pulse
modulation happen at both odd and even multiples of the PWM
sampling frequency.
IV. TRANSMITTER IMPLEMENTATION
The schematic diagram of the polar transmitter using in-
terleaving pulse modulation is shown in Fig. 6. The two-way
lumped-element Wilkinson 3-dB power splitter and combiner
are used to split and combine the RF signals, and their measured
return loss and isolation are better than 20 dB at the desired
transmit band of 824‚Äì849 MHz shown in Fig. 7.
The class-C PAs and their pre-amplifiers are developed
using commercially available enhancement-mode pseudo-
morphic high electron-mobility transistors (pHEMTs) [19],
surface-mount inductors ( nH), and surface-mount
capacitors ( pF and pF). Operating at a
supply voltage of 3.6 V and using a continuous-wave (CW) test
signal of 836.5 MHz, the two-stage RF PAs are able to deliver
an output power of over 27 dBm with the gain and PAE being
over 25 dB and 70%, respectively. With the lumped-element
Wilkinson power splitter and combiner, the RF PAs can achieve
a peak output power of over 30 dBm.
A pair of commercially available single-pole single-throw
(SPST) RF switches is used for pulse modulation on the mod-
ulated constant-envelope signal [20]. The CMOS RF switches
provide an isolation of 40 dB with an insertion loss of 0.8 dB
and require 5 ns to switch on or off. When the switches are open,
both ports of the switches are connected to 50- terminations,

V. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
A. GSM
Since the Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modu-
lation used for GSM is a constant-envelope modulation, there
is no need to pulse modulate the constant-envelope RF signal.
Therefore, the RF switches are turned on all the time to just
simply pass through the complex-modulated signal to RF PAs.
The measured transmitter output spectrum using a GSM test
signal at 28 dBm is shown in Fig. 10, and the output spectrum
is seen to pass the GSM spectral requirements [23].

YANG et al.: POLAR TRANSMITTER USING INTERLEAVING PULSE MODULATION FOR MULTIMODE HANDSETS 2089
Most linear high-efficiency transmitters can achieve excel-
lent PAE at peak output power, but their efficiency degrades
rapidly under back off [6], [10], [24]. Unfortunately, cellular
handsets transmit signals at a power level around 0 dBm most
of the time according to the probability density function of
transmitted power reported in [25]. Therefore, it is crucial for
a cellular phone transmitter to maintain high efficiency under
back off. The measured PAE of the proposed polar transmitter
for a back-off range of 40 dB from peak power is shown in
Fig. 17. The peak PAE of the polar transmitter for the EDGE
and WCDMA signals are 45.5% and 41.2%, respectively. The
PAE at 12-dB back off from peak power for the EDGE and
WCDMA signals are 33.5% and 32.4%, respectively. The PAE
of a commercial linear PA is also measured with the EDGE and
WCDMA signals. The PAE of the proposed transmitter is more
than three times better than that of the commercial PA at 12-dB
back off from peak output power.
The performance of the polar transmitter using interleaving
pulse modulation tested with GSM, EDGE, and WCDMA sig-
nals at 836.5 MHz is summarized in Table I. Table II shows the
recently published high-efficiency transmitters for single and
multiple cellular phone standards [26]‚Äì[31]. The proposed mul-
timode polar transmitter achieves excellent peak PAE, back-off
PAE, and output dynamic range without the need of pre-distor-
tion or calibration.
VI. CONCLUSION
A polar transmitter using interleaving pulse modulation has
been demonstrated for linear power amplification with high
efficiency for multiple cellular phone standards. By using
interleaving pulse modulation, the odd output modulation spurs
of the transmitter can be cancelled, which eases spur filtering
and signal restoring. The output power of the transmitter tested
with the GSM, EDGE, and WCDMA signals at 836.5 MHz is
28, 26, and 25 dBm, respectively. The delivered output power
conforms to GSM class 5, EDGE class E2, and WCDMA class
3 standards. In addition, the transmitter can pass the stringent
WCDMA ACLR and EDGE ORFS with plenty of margin
without the need of pre-distortion. Moreover, up to 80 dB of
output dynamic range can be achieved by the proposed polar
transmitter, while exhibiting excellent PAE and slow efficiency
degradation resulted from output power back off.

A Power-Recycling Technique for Improving Power
Amplifier Efficiency Under Load Mismatch
Chun-Wei Chang, Yi-Jan Emery Chen, Senior Member, IEEE, and Jau-Horng Chen, Member, IEEE
Abstract‚ÄîThis letter presents a method for improving the effi-
ciency of a power amplifier (PA) under load mismatch by recycling
the reflected power. By configuring the PA as a balanced PA, the
reflected power will be directed to the isolation port of a 90 hy-
brid coupler. The reflected power can then by rectified and con-
verted back to dc power to assist in supplying the PA. A prototype
system was built to validate the concept and tested under various
load phase angles with 2:1 and 4:1 VSWR using a W-CDMA voice
signal at 836.5 MHz. Measurement results show that the power re-
cycling technique improves the overall efficiency by as much as
22.1% when the output power level is 25 dBm. Under load con-
ditions and power levels where the rectifier cannot provide suffi-
cient output voltage level to supply the PA, the proposed technique
simply maintains the original PA efficiency with no degradation.

crowave amplifiers.
I. INTRODUCTION
T HE load of the radio-frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA)in a mobile device is constantly changing and is rarely
at a 50 matched condition. Unlike base stations, mobile de-
vices are rarely stationary and depending on the habits of the
user and the location of usage, the range of load conditions
may vary widely. PAs nowadays are specified to operate under
a load mismatch as high as 4:1 and are required to withstand
a 10:1 VSWR without damage. The first effect from load mis-
match is the degradation of linearity, which may cause the PA
to fail certain spectral requirements defined by various com-
munication standards. Such degradation can be overcome by
backing-off or overdesigning the PA, but at the expense of lower
efficiency. With the development of low-power adaptive digital
pre-distortion techniques for mobile devices, it is now possible
to achieve high linearity under mismatch without the need of
significant overdesign [1], [2]. However, digital pre-distortion
as in [2] only maintains constant incident power. The power re-
flected from the load mismatch cannot be reduced and is dis-
sipated in the form of heat. In [3], supply voltage adaption is
used to prevent clipping and improve linearity, but it does not

reduce the power lost from reflection as in [1], [2]. In [4] a
Wilkinson power combiner is used to implement a balanced PA,
which makes the overall amplifier less sensitive to load mis-
match. However, power from reflection is simply dissipated as
in [3]. It would be highly desirable if the reflected power from
load mismatch can be recycled such that the overall efficiency
of the PA can be increased.
In this letter, a power-recycling technique is proposed to op-
erate in conjunction with the balanced amplifier architecture to
form a power-recycling balanced PA. An RF-DC rectifier cir-
cuit is inserted at the isolation port of a balanced PA and the
dc output is connected back to the battery terminal. When the
reflected power is high enough such that the RF-DC rectifier is
functional, the current drained from the battery is reduced and
thus the overall efficiency is improved. The basic block diagram
of the proposed architecture is shown in Fig. 1.
II. THEORY OF OPERATION
The balanced PA architecture is a well-known method that
improves the input and output matching over a wide bandwidth
[5]. The balanced amplifier uses two 90 hybrid couplers to
cancel the input and output reflections of two identical PAs.
For a mobile device, the input is normally well matched and
hence a compact poly-phase filter can be used in an integrated
implementation. However, the output load may be constantly
changing and under load mismatch, the reflected power will ap-
pear at the isolation port of the output 90 hybrid coupler and
be dissipated in the termination resistor [5]. Most importantly,
this architecture does not degrade the output power or the effi-
ciency of the individual PAs, making it highly suitable for im-
plementing high-efficiency PAs. The use of the balanced ampli-
fier architecture makes it possible to construct a load-insensitive
PA.

all load phase angles at 25 dBm, the proposed technique was
able to improve the overall efficiency. To show the benefit of
the proposed technique, measurements over the complete cel-
lular band at 4:1 VSWR and -degree load phase angle
were performed using the Wilkinson power combiner proposed
in [4], and the balanced amplifier architecture with and without
the proposed power recycling technique. The measurement re-
sults are compared in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the efficiency of
the balanced amplifier is approximately equal to the usage of the
Wilkinson power combiner while the proposed technique shows
significant improvement in efficiency. Linearity measurements
were also performed and shown in Fig. 8. For both cases, the lin-
earity can be greatly improved using the techniques proposed in
[1]‚Äì[3], while the proposed technique will demonstrate higher
efficiency than the conventional implementations.
V. CONCLUSION
A method for improving the efficiency of PAs under load mis-
match with little added circuitry is proposed. By constructing a
PA as a balanced PA and adding a simple RF-DC rectifier cir-
cuit, part of the reflected power as a result of load mismatch
can be recycled to improve the overall efficiency. To verify the
proposed architecture, a prototype system using commercially
available components was designed and implemented. Using an
836.5-MHz W-CDMA voice signal, the efficiency of the pro-
posed system was able to achieve a maximum increase of 22.1%
with no degradation to the PA efficiency at all operating condi-
tions.
