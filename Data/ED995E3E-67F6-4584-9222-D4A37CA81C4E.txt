metals/brazes and ceramics/brazes still were not 
elucidated. However, finer details of joint 
microstructure at greater resolution could not be 
revealed with these techniques. Thus, the project 
will engage in using analytical transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) to perform the microstructures 
characterization on the interfaces of steel/YSZ 
joints with various commercial brazes, such as Ag-, 
Cu-, Au-, Pd-, Ti-based brazes. From TEM analysis, 
the microstructures and its formation mechanism will 
be clarified.  
 
The next part is the preparation of in-house 
synthesized braze powders using powder metallurgy. 
The two primary challenges with metallic seals are 
cost (i.e., noble metals, such as Ag-, Pt-, and Au-
base brazes) and wetting of the ceramic components. 
Copper is cheap and has a high thermal conductivity 
and electrical conductivity which allow for quick 
heat dissipation at the SOFC joint and meet the basic 
electrical conductivity requirements. The large 
ductility in copper can help accommodate the thermal 
stresses due to the CTE mismatch of steel, YSZ, and 
brazes. The chemical inertness of copper allows for 
copper to be utilized at high operating temperature 
while exhibiting good oxidation resistance through 
the addition of parabolic oxide forming additives. In 
order to strengthen the oxidation resistance and 
wetting of ceramics, Ti, Al, Ni, and Sn additives 
will be added into the Cu-based braze. In this 
project, we would find out the best Cu-based braze 
for steel/YSZ joint of SOFC applications.

Abstract 
 
Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/stainless steel joints made using two commercial silver-base 
interlayers containing palladium (58Ag-32Cu-10Pd and 65Ag-20Cu-15Pd), were systematically 
analyzed for the microstructures of the interlayer matrices, interlayer–steel interface, and 
interlayer–YSZ interface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron 
microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM/EDS). In the interlayer matrix, a 
face-centered cubic (FCC) Cu-rich phase formed in the vicinity of the YSZ and dissolved a 
significant amount of Zr from the ZrO2 and minor amounts of Fe and Cr from the steel. The Cu-rich 
phase in the interlayer matrix in the vicinity of the steel substrate was the ordered phase Cu3Pd with 
antiphase boundaries (APBs) and the L12 crystal structure. Silver particles precipitated within the 
Cu3Pd phase in 58Ag-32Cu-10Pd; a Fe(Cr) needle-like phase, instead of Ag particles, precipitated 
within the Cu3Pd phase in 65Ag-20Cu-15Pd. Although no reaction products at the interlayer–steel 
interface were found, dislocations appeared within the Ag- and Cu-rich phases. At the interlayer–YSZ 
interface, two reaction products, SiO2 (impurity in YSZ) and Ti3O5 (from the reaction of YSZ with Ti 
impurities in the steel) were observed. Diffusion and chemical reactions led to compositional changes 
and interface reconstruction, thereby yielding metallurgically sound YSZ/steel joints.

above the braze liquidus), held isothermally at the brazing temperature for 5 min, and then cooled to 
room temperature at a controlled rate. The cross-sectional TEM specimens of YSZ/interlayer/steel 
joints were cut, ground, polished and then ion milled by standard procedures. The microstructures 
were characterized using a JSM-6330F scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and a 
JEM 2010Fx transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an ISIS300 
energy dispersive spectrometer (Oxford Instrument, London, UK). Quantitative composition analyses 
were performed based on the principles of the Cliff–Lorimer12 standardless method. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 SEM analysis  
Figure 1(a) displays a backscattered electron image (BEI) of the steel/58Ag-32Cu-10Pd/YSZ 
joint. Two main phases, dark and white areas, within the 58Ag-32Cu-10Pd interlayer were observed. 
In the Ag-Cu system,13 after cooling, the dark area was a Cu-rich phase and the light area was a 
Ag-rich phase. Small spherical particles (marked with arrows in Fig. 1) formed in both the Cu- and 
Ag-rich matrices. In the Cu-rich areas, white spherical particles formed near the steel; their 
abundance gradually decreased upon approaching the YSZ. In contrast, dark spherical particles 
formed in the Ag-rich areas. In the steel/65Ag-20Cu-15Pd/YSZ joint [Fig. 1(b)], needle-like 
precipitates formed in the Cu-rich areas, in contrast to the white spherical particles that had formed in 
the steel/58Ag-32Cu-10Pd/YSZ joint [Fig. 1(a)]; the dark spherical particles formed in the Ag-rich 
matrices of both joints. The abundance of the needle-like precipitates in the Cu-rich areas gradually 
decreased upon progressing away from the steel toward the YSZ; these precipitates formed due to 
elemental dissolution of the steel constituents (e.g., Fe and Cr) in the interlayer. Different variants of 
the needle-like precipitates formed within the matrix, as indicated by the arrows in an enlarged image 
in the inset to Fig. 1(b). At the steel–interlayer and interlayer–YSZ interfaces, no obvious reaction 
layer formation occurred, as evidenced by the SEM images in Figs. 1(a) and (b). 
 
 
3.2 TEM analysis  
3.2.1 Ag-rich matrix in interlayer 
Figure 2(a) presents a BFI (bright-field image) of a Cu particle within the Ag-rich matrix in the 
steel/58Ag-32Cu-10Pd/YSZ joint, corresponding to the dark spherical particles in the Ag-rich regions 
of Fig. 1(a). From the EDS analysis in Fig. 2(b), the spherical particle is Cu-rich and the matrix is 
Ag-rich. Figures 2 (c) and (d) display the superimposed SADPs of the Cu-rich particle and the 
Ag-rich matrix with zone axes of [ 1 12]Cu-particle//[ 1 12]Ag-rich and [ 1 11] Cu-particle//[ 1 11]Ag-rich, 
respectively. The crystal structures of the Cu particle and Ag-rich matrix are face-centered cubic 
(FCC) and their orientation relationship is cube-on-cube. The lattice parameters of pure Cu and Ag 
are 0.362 and 0.408 nm, respectively; for the Cu particle and Ag-rich matrix in our joints, the values 
were calculated as 0.374 and 0.418 nm, respectively. Obviously, the lattice parameters of the Cu-rich 
 4
superlattice spots (100) and (0 1 1) appear in the diffraction pattern of the Cu-rich matrix. The Cu-rich 
matrix near the steel had the Cu3Pd phase and the orientation relationship between the Ag particles 
and the Cu3Pd phase was cube-on-cube, similar to that of the Cu or Cu3Pd particles in the Ag-rich 
matrix [Figs. 2(c), 2(d), and 3(c)]. The lattice parameters of the Ag particles and the Cu3Pd phase 
were 0.430 and 0.390 nm, respectively. An APB appeared in the Cu3Pd phase, as evidenced in Fig. 
4(d) by a dark-field image along the [0 1 1] reflection of Fig. 4(c). 
Figure 5(a) presents the BFI of the Cu-rich matrix within the 65Ag-20Cu-15Pd interlayer; it 
reveals needle-like Fe(Cr) phase precipitates (with three variants marked by arrows in Fig. 5a) 
corresponding to the Cu-rich regions in the SEM image of Fig. 1(b). Large amounts of Fe and Cr had 
dissolved in the Cu-rich matrix, resulting in a supersaturated Cu-rich matrix from which the Fe(Cr) 
phase precipitated upon cooling. Figure 5(b) reveals the composition of the Fe(Cr) needle-like phase 
and the Cu-rich matrix. Figures 5(c)–(e) present the SADPs of the Fe(Cr) phase and the Cu-rich 
(Cu3Pd) phase, along with zone axes of [10 1 ]Fe(cr)//[001]Cu-rich, [1 1 0]Fe(cr)//[010]Cu-rich, and 
[110]Fe(cr)//[100]Cu-rich, respectively. The Cu-rich phase was Cu3Pd, as evidenced by the large degree of 
Pd dissolution (35 at.%) and the appearance of superlattice spots in the SADPs of the Cu-rich 
matrices. From the SADP and EDS data, the Fe(Cr) phase was body-centered cubic (BCC) and the 
Cu-rich phase was Cu3Pd with an L12 crystal structure. In addition, the orientation of the Fe(Cr) and 
Cu-rich phases had a Bain relationship. Figures 6 (a)–(c) display schematic representations of the 
Fe(Cr) and Cu-rich (Cu3Pd) phases with three variants: [10 1 ]Fe(cr)//[001]Cu-rich, [1 1 0]Fe(cr)//[010]Cu-rich, 
and [110]Fe(cr)//[100]Cu-rich according to the SADPs of Figs. 5(c)–(e). The Bain relationship of the FCC 
to BCC transformation with three types of Bain variants has been proposed in the corresponding iron 
system.17, 18 They indicate that the FCC to BCC Bain transformation is a martensitic phase 
transformation that accompanies crystal structure distortion or a rigid body rotation. From the SADPs 
in Figs. 5(d) and (e), the angle between the (002) planes of the Fe(Cr) and Cu-rich phases was rotated 
approximately 9.7°, suggesting that the Fe(Cr) crystal structure formed in the Cu3Pd phase was 
accompanied by either rotation or distortion. 
The Cu-rich phases in the 58Ag-32Cu-10Pd and 65Ag-20Cu-15Pd interlayers near the steel had 
different microstructures. According to the Cu-Ag phase diagram, Ag particles precipitated with a 
cube-on-cube relationship in the Cu-rich regions of the 58Ag-32Cu-10Pd interlayer because of a 
decrease in the solubility of Ag in Cu during cooling.19 Upon increasing the Pd content to 15 wt% in 
65Ag-20Cu-15Pd, however, large amounts of Fe and Cr dissolved in the Cu-rich matrix, resulting in 
the precipitation of the Fe(Cr) phase in the Cu-rich matrix with three variants and the orientation 
relationship similar to that of the Bain transformation. The EDS data in Figs. 4(b) and 5(b) revealed 
that approximately 10 wt% of Pd effectively inhibited the diffusion of Fe (6.3 at.%) and Cr (1.0 at.%) 
into the Cu-rich matrix of 58Ag-32Cu-10Pd, thereby suppressing the formation of the needle-like 
Fe(Cr) phase. In contrast, the higher (15 wt%) Pd content in 65Ag-20Cu-15Pd aided the diffusion and 
redistribution of Fe (24.8 at.%) and Cr (4.4 at.%) in the Cu-rich matrix of the interlayer, leading to the 
formation of needle-like Fe(Cr) phases within the Cu-rich matrix. Here, the Cu-rich phase dissolved a 
large amount of Pd (18–35 at.%) and underwent transformation into the ordered L12-type Cu3Pd 
phase with APBs upon cooling.

high-resolution image of amorphous SiO2. Silica is the most common impurity present in YSZ, along 
with alumina and alkali metal oxides.21 Thus, it was possible that amorphous SiO2 gathered at the 
interface between the interlayer and the YSZ. Another reaction product was Ti3O5, identified in the 
digital diffractogram of Fig. 9(f). 
The EDS data in Fig. 9(b) revealed that 13 at.% of Al arose from an impurity of alumina in the 
YSZ, and that it diffused into Ti3O5. We believe that the source of Ti arose from the minor alloying 
constituents (e.g., Ti, P, Si, Ni) found in steel, because no Ti exists in the commercial Ag-Cu-Pd braze 
58Ag-32Cu-10Pd. Owing to its higher affinity for oxygen, Ti atoms will diffuse across the interlayer 
and react with the YSZ to form Ti3O5 at the interface. From JCPDS (#82-1138), Ti3O5 is monoclinic 
with lattice parameters a, b, c, and β of 9.8 Å, 3.8 Å, 9.5 Å, and 93°, respectively; in 
58Ag-32Cu-10Pd, however, these lattice parameters for Ti3O5 were 9.3 Å, 8.8 Å, 3.3 Å, and 97°, 
respectively. Residual stresses from the CTE mismatch between the YSZ and the interlayer would 
cause the Ti3O5 crystal structure to slightly deform, leading to differences in the lattice parameters. 
The Gibbs free energies (∆G) for Ti oxide formation have been proposed for the reactions of Ti with 
ZrO2.4, 8 Singh et al. indicated that the values of ∆G for oxide formation in the brazing temperature 
range 1193–1253 K for the various oxides of Ti (in kJ) were as follows: TiO2 (–706.9 to –724.7), TiO 
(–417.5 to –428.5), Ti4O7 (–2590.7 to –2662.9), and Ti3O5 (–1878.9 to –1929.7). These negative 
values reveal that formation of titanium oxides is probable. In our present system, however, we 
observed evidence for the presence of Ti3O5, but not other Ti oxides. Although compounds such as 
Pd3Zr, Pd2Zr, PdZr, PdZr2, Pd3Y, Pd2Y, Pd3Y2, and PdY can also form at relatively low (1073–1473 K) 
temperatures in Pd-Zr and Pd-Y systems, we found no evidence for any of these phases. 
Figure 10(a) displays a BFI of the interlayer–YSZ interface in a steel/65Ag-20Cu-15Pd/YSZ 
joint; dislocation substructures appeared in the Cu-rich phase and Ti3O5 and SiO2 in the 
interlayer–YSZ interface were observed. The EDS data in Fig. 10(b) reveals that the Ti3O5 contained 
11 at.% Al and the Cu-rich phase dissolved 16.4 at.% Zr, but the content of Pd was very low (0.2 
at.%). Thus, the Cu-rich phase was FCC Cu and not Cu3Pd. Figures 10(c) and (d) present the SADPs 
of the Cu-rich phase with a zone axis of [001] and of the t-ZrO2 with a zone axis of [011], 
respectively. A digital diffractogram obtained from a high-resolution image of SiO2 [Fig. 10(e)] 
reveals that the crystal structure was amorphous. Figure 10(f) provides a digital diffractogram 
obtained from a high-resolution image of the Ti3O5 with a [010] zone axis; from it, the lattice 
parameters were calculated as a, b, c, and β of 9.1 Å, 8.5 Å, 3.1 Å, and 93°, respectively. 
 
4. Conclusions  
Two commercial Ag-based interlayers containing Pd as an alloying element (58Ag-32Cu-10Pd and 
65Ag-20Cu-15Pd) were used to join YSZ to a corrosion-resistant ferritic stainless steel. The SEM and 
TEM coupled with EDS to characterize the microstructures of the interlayer matrix and the 
interlayer–steel and interlayer–YSZ interfaces. In the interlayer matrix, the Cu-rich phase near the 
YSZ was FCC Cu; it dissolved a significant amount of Zr from ZrO2 and minor amounts of Fe and Cr 
from the steel. The Cu-rich phase in the interlayer matrix near the steel was the ordered phase Cu3Pd 
with APBs and an L12 crystal structure. Silver particles precipitated within the Cu3Pd phase in the

1. Introduction   
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on ionic oxide electrolytes are attractive for the electrochemical 
generation of electrical energy [1, 2]. Among the robust integration technologies available to join 
oxides to metals, the most common method is active metal brazing [3-8]. Studies on the joining of 
ceramics to metals for SOFC applications using active brazes such as Ag-based [3-5], Cu-based [3, 6], 
Au-based [7], and Pd-based [8] metal fillers have been conducted. High operating temperatures in air 
and fuel environments can lead to increased material degradation for SOFCs, especially in metal and 
ceramic joints [9]. Before joining, the oxidation behavior of a given active metal braze used at high 
temperatures in air must be thoroughly characterized. Several studies have investigated the oxidation 
behavior of Ag-Cu and Au-based active metallic interlayers [10-16]. These studies indicated that 
oxides form at the surface of interlayers, oxides such as CuO, Cu2O, TiO2, and Ti2O3 in Ag-Cu–based 
interlayers [11, 12], NiO in gold ABA (Au-2Ni-0.6Ti in wt.%) interlayers [10], and NiO and V2O5 in 
Nioro gold-ABA (Au-l6Ni-1.25V-0.75Mo in wt.%) interlayers. Gold-based interlayers are commonly 
used in metal and ceramic joints in SOFCs [7, 10, 16]. Although gold is noble and highly resistant to 
oxidation, the alloying elements Ti, V, and Ni possess affinity toward oxygen and will form oxides 
via diffusion and chemical reactions. Prior published studies [8,10-16] have utilized techniques such 
as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy to characterize the alloy structure following 
oxidation, or utilized the free energy considerations to analyze the oxidation behavior. The preceding 
analytical techniques, however, are inadequate for detecting and analyzing critical oxidized products 
at the surface of active metallic interlayers [10-16]. In this study, transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to 
analyze the reaction products on two commercial Au-based reactive metallic interlayers oxidized at 
850ºC for 200 min. Selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) and EDS of TEM were used to 
characterize the crystal structure and the compositions of the oxidized products. The Inorganic 
Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and crystallographic software (Diamond version 3.0 and CaRine 
Crystallography 3.1) were used to identify the crystal structures of the chemical phases.  
 
2. Experimental Procedure 
The 96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti interlayer (0.1 mm thick) and the 97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V interlayer (0.12 mm 
thick) were obtained from Morgan Advanced Ceramics (Hayward, CA). In order to characterize the 
alloy oxidation behavior, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air on both types of 
interlayers at 850ºC for 200 min. The microstructure of the oxidized products on the interlayer 
surface was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (Model JEM 2010Fx, JEOL Ltd., 
Tokyo, Japan) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (Mode ISIS300, Oxford Instrument Inc., 
London, U.K.). For the cross-sectional TEM specimens, oxidized interlayers were cut, ground, 
polished and then ion-milled by standard procedures. The quantitative composition analyses were 
performed based on the principle of the Cliff–Lorimer [17] standardless method.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Figure 1(a) shows a transmission electron micrograph (bright-field image, BFI) of the 
96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti interlayer before oxidation. It shows a rod-like Au-rich phase accompanied with 
parameters of NiTiO3 were calculated to be a = 5.43 Å and λ = 54.30º, which corresponds with the 
values of NiTiO3 of ICSD # 15988 (a = 5.45 Å and λ = 55.13º).   
 
In our study, no titanium oxides were found in the oxidized 96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti interlayer, even though 
Ti exhibits a strong thermodynamic affinity toward oxygen [7]. It is quite probable that the absence of 
titanium oxides at the oxidized braze surface was due to the small amounts of Ti in the alloy. For 
instance, no titanium oxides were found at the oxidized interlayer surfaces in Ag-37.4Cu-10.8In-1.4Ti 
and Ag-44.4Cu-8.4Sn-0.9Ti alloys that contained small amounts of Ti [13]. However, titanium oxides 
(TiO2 and Ti2O3) formed in Ag-37.6Cu-5.5Ti and Ag-36.3Cu-9.0Ti alloys [11], and TiO2 formed in 
Ag-41.6Cu-9.7Sn-5.0Ti alloy [13]. These alloys contained Ti in excess of a specific amount (>5 wt. 
%). Therefore, it is believed that Ti reacts with Ni and O to form nickel titanate (NiTiO3) instead of 
titanium oxide in the 96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti interlayer after oxidation at 850ºC for 200 min.  
 
Figure 5 (a) shows a BFI of the 97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V interlayer following oxidation at 850ºC for 200 
min. This figure reveals a Au-rich phase and loose vanadium oxide (V2O5) accompanied with cracks. 
The composition of V2O5 is 41.5 at. % V, 57.0 at.% O, and 1.5 at.% Au. Figures 5(c) to (e) display the 
SADPs of V2O5 along with the zone axes of [ 1 1 1 ], [100], and [130], respectively. The lattice 
parameters of orthorhombic V2O5 were calculated to be a = 11.80 Å, b = 4.12 Å, c = 3.58 Å and λ = β 
= γ = 90º, corresponding with the values of V2O5 of ICSD # 15798 (a = 11.51 Å, b = 4.37 Å, c = 3.56 
Å and λ = β = γ = 90º). Figure 6 (a) shows a BFI of the 97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V interlayer oxidized at 
850ºC for 200 min. This figure shows that a Au-rich phase and a nickel vanadate (Ni2V2O7) phase 
formed at the surface of the interlayer. Figure 6(b) shows the EDS spectrum of Ni2V2O7, containing 
23.0 at.% Ni, 19.2 at. % V, and 57.8 at.% O. The SADPs of Ni2V2O7, along with the zone axes of 
[10 1 ], [111], and [211], respectively, are shown in Figs. 6(c) to (e). The lattice parameters of 
monoclinic Ni2V2O7 were calculated to be a = 6.65 Å, b = 8.27 Å, c = 9.25 Å and β = 99.66º, 
corresponding with a = 6.52 Å, b = 8.30 Å, c = 9.35 Å and β = 99.86º of monoclinic Ni2V2O7 in 
ICSD # 2358.   
 
A Au interlayer alloyed with V and Ni in the commercial braze alloy Nioro-ABA 
(Au-16Ni-1.25V-0.75Mo) has been evaluated following oxidation, and it was found that the 
area-specific weight of the samples increased appreciably after high-temperature annealing [16]. It 
was concluded that the weight gain increase corresponded directly with the oxidation of the Ni, V, 
and Mo alloying elements in the interlayers. The NiO scale that formed at the interlayer surface was 
observed by SEM and was assumed to contain minor amounts of vanadium oxide (V2O5) and 
molybdenum oxide (MoO3) [16]. However, the authors in [16] did not directly observe the vanadium 
oxide, molybdenum oxide, and other oxidized products. Here, in the oxidized 97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V 
interlayer, vanadium oxide (V2O5) and nickel vanadate (Ni2V2O7) are found, but no NiO phase was 
observed. It is believed that less Ni alloying is insufficient for NiO phase formation in the oxidized 
97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V interlayer.  
 
To summarize, a dense oxide scale composed of NiO and NiTiO3 phases [Fig. 4(a)] at the surface of

摘  要 
 
Robust sealing technology is extremely important to meet the hermeticity 
requirement of SOFC stacks due to their operating conditions. Metallic 
interlayer sealants can provide robust sealing and appropriate stress 
accommodation. Many studies have been conducted on the joining of 
zirconia to steels using Ag, Cu, Au, and Pd-based metallic interlayers. 
Among them, gold-based interlayers possess higher resistance to 
oxidation, close CTE to yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), and excellent 
thermal conductivity. In this study, YSZ/stainless steel joints using two 
commercial gold-based interlayers, 96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti and 
97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V (in wt.%), were analyzed for the microstructure of 
interlayer matrix, interlayer/steel interface, and interlayer/YSZ interface 
by SEM and TEM/EDS.  
In the 96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti/steel interface, Au3Mn precipitated in the steel 
and a dense Au-rich layer was found between steel and interlayer. 
However, Au-rich layer was not observed at the 
97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V/steel interface. Needle-like Fe(Cr) precipitates 
within the Au-matrix were observed in both gold-based interlayers. At the 
96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti/YSZ interface, a Ti2O3 layer and a small amount of 
Ni3Si2 were found. However, at the 97.5Au-0.75Ni-1.75V/YSZ interface, 
no interfacial layer of vanadium oxide was observed, except a large 
amount of Au in the grain boundaries of zirconia. The 96.4Au-3Ni-0.6Ti 
interlayer appears to be a better choice for joining of YSZ to steel. The 
effect of thermal cycling on the interfacial microstructure has been 
discussed.

目前 SOFC 密封材料分為剛性密封材料(rigid seals)，如玻璃、玻璃陶瓷。而壓縮密封材
料(compressive seals)，如金屬及雲母(mica)兩種為主。玻璃及玻璃陶本質上較硬脆，
目前也不斷地被開發添加不同添加劑改善此缺點。為了達到具有剛性及壓縮密封的兩種特

多，與接合元件之間的擴散造成接合強劣化是一直再探討的課題。
