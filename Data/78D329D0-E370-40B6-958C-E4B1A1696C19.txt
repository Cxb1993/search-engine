Impedimetric approach may be the method of 
choice to monitor the process and eventually 
quantify the extent of cell attachment. 
In this study, an impedimetric system and 
a cell cultivation chamber with 
microfabricated interdigitated electrodes were 
used to monitor the impedance response 
during the cell attachment process of 
Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells 
on the electrodes. Chambers embedded with 
RGD-C peptide (a peptide containing 
cellulose binding domain rich in 
arginine-glycine-aspartate sequence) coated 
electrode was also studied. Conductance 
change at lower frequency was found to be 
useful in quantifying the extent (cells/cm2) of 
cell attachment, in determining the timing of 
intial and final state of the process and also in 
investigating the biocompatibility of materials 
for cell attachment. 
2. Material and Methods 
2.1 Impedimetric Measuring Chamber with 
Microelectrodes 
Interdigitated microelectrode plate (IMP) 
was made on a glass slide (26 × 76 mm) by a 
wet-etching process.  The slide (26 × 76 mm) 
was ultrasonically cleaned for 30 min in a 
cleaning solution (JTB-100, Mallinckrodt 
Baker, Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ) and dried in 
nitrogen atmosphere.  Onto the surface, 20 
nm of titanium film and then 50 nm of gold 
film were sputtered at a pressure of 10-7 torr.  
Positive photoresist (S1818S, Shipley Inc., 
Marlborough, MA) was spin-coated on the 
Au-coated surface to form a uniform film of 5 
μm in thickness.  The pattern of 
interdigitated electrodes was developed by 
after UV exposure (λ = 380 nm for 20 sec).  
The unmasked layers of Ti and Au were 
removed by their respective etching solutions, 
and S1818 removing agent was used to 
eliminate the residual photoresist.  All the 
procedures were conducted in an 
air-conditioned clean room at 28oC. Cell 
chamber for impedimetric measurement was 
constructed by mounting and fixing a section 
of glass tube (12 mm i.d. × 6 cm height) on 
the IMP plate using epoxy resin.  In some 
cases, the microelectrodes were dipped-coated 
with 1 mg/cm2 of RGD-C peptide.  RGD-C 
peptide was donated by Dr. Chen, National 
Chung-Hsing University [11, 22]. 
2.2 Culturing cells in the measuring chamber 
MDCK cells (ATCC CCL-34, passages 
50-90) were cultured in Dulbeco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO, Grand 
Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (GIBCO) and 5% gentamicin at 
37oC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 
and 95% air.  Cell suspension was obtained 
by a standard trypsinization procedure, and 
the suspension was refreshed and diluted to a 
suitable extent by centrifugation/resuspension 
procedures. Four ml of cell suspension was 
added into the measuring chamber sterilized 
with 75% ethanol.  
2.3 Impedance analyzing system  
Time-resolved admittance spectra were 
obtained with a commercialized impedance 
analyzer (hp4194A, Agilent Technology Inc., 
Lake Mary, FL).  The operating frequency 
was scanned from 1 kHz to 1 MHz by 10 kHz 
increment, and the sampling interval was 1 
min.  The system was software-controlled 
under LabVIEW 5.01 environment (National 
Instruments Co., Austin, TX).  Fig. 1a shows 
the schematic diagram of the system. 
3. Result and Discussion 
3.1 Cell cultivation on the Interdigitated 
Microelectrode 
 Fig. 1b is the schematic diagram of the 
IMP, and the photograph of the micro-pattern 
was shown in Fig. 1c.  The interdigitated 
pattern of electrode pair is high in cell 
constant (3.2 cm), which enhanced the 
impedance responses [21].  The apparent 
electrode surface area within the chamber was 
calculated to be about 0.55 cm2.  As shown 
by Fig. 1c, MDCK cells can be cultivated on 
the electrode surface during the admittance 
measurement.

4. Conclusions 
The on-line admittance monitoring 
system was proven to be useful in studying 
the dynamic processes occurred in the 
interface between the microelectrodes and the 
cells.  Data obtained with the impedimetric 
system were informative for cell physiology 
and biomaterial studies. Cell 
attaching/detaching process, formation of 
confluent layer, apoptosis and even migration 
phenomena may be resolved and quantified 
by the proposed system.  The study provided 
also a reliable protocol to determine the cell 
density attached onto the surface interested 
and also the timing of the attach process.
