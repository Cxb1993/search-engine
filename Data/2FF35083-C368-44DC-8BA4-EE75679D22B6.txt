  
networks usually need many high-speed 
lightpaths for connecting computer servers in 
diverse enterprise campuses. A major feature 
of such applications is that traffic demands 
are requested to the network in advance 
before the connections are set up [1,2,3,4]. 
The Advance Lightpath Reservation 
problem is in short referred to as ALR in this 
report. One major challenge arising in ALR 
has been to jointly determine call admission 
control, scheduling, and Routing and 
Wavelength Assignment (RWA) [6]. 
Particularly, for optical network without 
wavelength conversion capability, the 
problem deals with RWA between source 
and destination nodes subject to the 
wavelength-continuity constraint [7]. It has 
been shown that RWA is an NP-complete 
problem [7]. Therefore, the ALR problem is 
also NP-complete since an RWA problem is 
a special case of the ALR problem.  
Several algorithms for resolving the ALR 
problem have been proposed in the literature. 
In [1], the authors present a basic framework 
for automated provisioning of advance 
reservation service based on GMPLS 
protocol suites. In [5], the ALR problem is 
classified into several types depending on the 
flexibility of call arrival time and call 
duration. Heuristic RWA algorithms are also 
demonstrated for the problems. In [2], a 
simulated annealing based algorithm is 
proposed to find a solution on predetermined 
k-shortest paths. For lambda grid networks, 
Miyagi et al. consider how to reserve a 
wavelength for deadline-aware application 
[3]. Performance for blocking probability is 
evaluated under greedy based and deadline 
first based heuristic algorithms. 
Lagrangean Relaxation (LGR) based 
method has been shown to be an effective 
method in solving WDM network problems, 
for instance in [8]. In this project, we 
propose a new LGR algorithm, which is used 
the first time to our best knowledge to 
precisely and efficiently solve the advance 
lightpath reservation problem. In this project, 
ALR is first formulated as a combinatorial 
optimization problem in which the revenue 
from admitting call requests is maximized. 
The LGR approach performs constraint 
relaxation and derives an upper-bound 
solution according to a set of Lagrangean 
multipliers generated through 
subgradient-based iterations. In parallel, 
using the generated Lagrangean multipliers, 
the LGR approach employs a new primal 
heuristic algorithm to arrive at a 
near-optimal solution. By upper bounds, we 
delineate the performance of LGR with 
respect to accuracy and convergence speed 
under different parameter settings and 
termination criteria. We further draw 
comparisons between LGR and a set of 
heuristic approaches via experiments over 
the widely-used NSFNET network. 
Numerical results demonstrate that LGR 
outperforms the other heuristic approaches in 
both accuracy and call blocking probability. 
The remainder of this report is organized as 
follows. In Section 2, we first give the ALR 
problem formulation. In Section 3, we 
present the LGR approach and its primal 
heuristic algorithm. In Section 4, we 
demonstrate numerical results of the 
performance study and comparisons under 
benchmark of the NSFNET network. Finally, 
concluding remarks are made in Section 5. 
 
II. Problem Formulation 
We consider a WDM network where each 
WDM link consists of a pair of 
unidirectional fiber links with a number of 
wavelengths on each fiber. The network is 
under centralized control. There is a central 
controller responsible for call admission 
control, routing and wavelength assignment 
so as to establish lightpaths for all 
connection requests on behalf of all network 
nodes. 
The ALR problem is formulated as an 
integer linear programming problem stated 
as follows. Given a physical topology and 
each call information (start time, end time, 
revenue), determine the scheduling of routes 
and wavelengths of lightpaths, such that the 
total revenue from admitting calls is 
maximized under the wavelength continuity 
constraint. The bandwidth demand is one 
wavelength in the context of this report. 
  
mathematical problems by means of 
constraint relaxation and problem 
decomposition. Particularly for solving a 
linear integer problem, unlike the traditional 
linear programming approach that relaxes 
integer into non-integer constraints, the 
Lagrangean-based method generally leaves 
the integer constraints in the constraint sets 
while relaxing complex constraints such that 
the relaxed problem can be decomposed into 
independent manageable subproblems. 
Through such a relaxation and 
decomposition, the Lagrangean relaxation 
method is shown to provide tighter bounds 
and shorter computation time on the optimal 
values of objective functions than those 
provided by the linear programming 
relaxation approach in many instances [9]. 
Essentially, the original primal problem is 
first simplified and transformed into a dual 
problem after some constraints are relaxed. 
If the objective of the primal problem is a 
maximization or minimization function, the 
solution to the dual problem is a respective 
upper or lower bound to the original problem. 
Such Lagrangean bound is a useful 
by-product in resolving the Lagrangean 
relaxation problem. Next, due to constraint 
relaxation, the upper bound solutions 
generated during the computation might be 
infeasible for the original primal problem. 
However, these solutions and the generated 
Lagrangean multipliers can serve as a base to 
develop efficient primal heuristic algorithms 
for achieving a near-optimal solution to the 
original problem. 
3.1 Dual Problem and Upper Bound  
In the relaxation process, constraint (3) is 
first relaxed from the constraint set. The 
expression corresponding to the constraints, 
is multiplied by Lagrangean multipliers uwlt , 
and then summed with the original objective 
function. Problem (P) is thus transformed 
into a dual problem, called Dual_P, given as 
follows:

bound is designated as the LB. 
To obtain a near-optimal solution that is 
the highest lower bound, at the end of a 
subgradient iteration, the LGR solution is 
verified whether or not it satisfies those 
relaxed constraints. If it does, the solution is 
feasible and is thus used to calculate a lower 
bound of the primal problem (P). If the 
solution is infeasible, we employ the 
following LGR-based heuristic algorithm, 
which takes advantage of Lagrangean 
multipliers. As shown in Fig. 3, the LGR 
algorithm sequentially accepts connections 
based on the rk ck values. Calls with higher 
rk ck hold higher priority in the sequence. 
The routing is determined by Dijkstra’s 
shortest path algorithm based on the link cost,

, as those used in the previous section 
except that those links cost are set to infinite 
for wavelengths are taken by previous calls. 
It prevents those calls with lower priority to 
use the wavelength channel taken by 
previous high priority one. If there are not 
enough resources for the request, the call is 
rejected. The algorithm run repeatedly until 
all requests are satisfied or rejected.  
 
IV. Experimental Results 
We have carried out a performance study on 
the LGR approach, and drawn comparisons 
between LGR and some heuristic algorithms 
via experiments over the well-known 
NSFNET Network. In the simulations, the 
start time and end time of call requests are 
generated randomly following uniform 
distribution in one day. Consequently, the 
mean call duration is 450 minutes. The call 
revenue rk is set exactly equal to the call 
duration. Therefore, a call with longer 
duration receives more revenue than those 
with shorter durations.  
In the computation using our LGR 
approach, we adopted Iteration_Number = 
3000 and Quiescence_Threshold = 50. The 
LGR algorithm can obtain near optimal 
results within 10 minutes of computation 
time operated on a PC running Windows XP 
with a 2 GHz CPU power. 
Three other heuristics are also considered 
in the study. The Greedy method 
sequentially allocates lightpaths according to 
connection’s rk value. Calls with larger 
revenues hold higher priority in call setup

Sorting )(uZ subk for all calls k and put their index in

英文：Advance lightpath reservation is a new research topic for 
connecting high-speed computer servers in lambda grid applications 
and for dynamic lightpath provisioning in the future optical internet. In 
such networks, users make call requests in advance to reserve network 
resources for communications. The challenge of the problem comes 
from how to jointly determine call admission control, lightpath routing, 
and wavelength assignment. In this project, we propose an efficient 
Lagrangean Relaxation (LGR) approach to resolve advance lightpath 
reservation for multi-wavelength optical networks. The task is first 
formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem in which the 
revenue from accepting call requests is to be maximized. The LGR 
approach performs constraint relaxation and derives an upper-bound 
solution index according to a set of Lagrangean multipliers generated 
through subgradient-based iterations. In parallel, using the generated 
Lagrangean multipliers, the LGR approach employs a new heuristic 
algorithm to arrive at a near-optimal solution. By upper bounds, we 
assess the performance of LGR with respect to solution accuracy. We 
further draw comparisons between LGR and three heuristic algorithms-
Greedy, First Come First Serve, and Deadline First, via experiments 
over the widely-used NSFNET network. Numerical results demonstrate 
that LGR outperforms the other three heuristic approaches in gaining 
more revenue by receiving more call requests.
