英文摘要 
Key words: Groundwater, release history, simulated annealing, function fitting, optimization 
 
An approach using function fitting technique and simulated annealing (SA) incorporated 
with a two-dimensional fundamental solution of transport equation is developed to reconstruct the 
release history for a groundwater contamination problem.  The fundamental solutions describing 
the contaminant released from an area source into a homogeneous aquifer in two dimensions for 
two different aquifer configurations are considered.  The first configuration considers that the 
aquifer has infinite width while the second considers the width of the aquifer is finite.  A 
scenario of groundwater contamination with a hypothetical release function is designed to 
examine the applicability of the developed approach.  The sampling concentrations at the 
monitoring wells are calculated based on the fundamental solution with the hypothetical release 
function.  For source release history recovery problem, the release history at a known source 
location is usually unknown and can be estimated by the function-fitting technique.  The 
unknown source release history is assumed as a combination of several exponential functions.  
The SA generates trial parameter values for the assumed release function.  The simulated 
concentrations are then derived from the fundamental solution with the trial release function.  
While minimizing the sum of square errors between the simulated and sampling concentrations, 
the SA could determine the optimal parameters of the assumed release function.  Finally, the 
curve of the source release history could be observed after plotting the determined function. 
INTRODUCTION 
Recently, many soil and groundwater pollution events have been reported in Taiwan.  
These reports reveal that people’s health may be impaired if living near the contaminated sites.  
 Analytical model is one of useful tools in predicting groundwater contaminant transport for 
a field problem.  The analytical solutions of ADE given in AT123D by Yeh [6] can be used to 
simulate the transport of contaminant in a groundwater aquifer system.  Assume the aquifer is 
homogeneous, isotropic and the flow is steady and uniform, the plume concentration may then be 
written as [6]:

Cin(τ) is the contaminant source release function [ML-3] and ),,( τ−TyxF  is fundamental 
solution of ADE, or called kernel function [T-1].  Two aquifer configurations are considered, one 
has an infinite width while the other has a finite width.  Equations (2) and (3) are the kernel 
function of an area source when the aquifer has an infinite width (case A) and a finite width (case 
B) in y direction, respectively,

where B is the width of the aquifer [L], L1, B1 and L2, B2 are the beginning x, y and the end x, y 
coordinates of the source [L], Dx and Dy are the component of the retarded dispersion tensor in x 
and y directions respectively [L2T-1], and v is the average linear velocity in x direction [LT-1].  In 
AT123D, the kernel function depends on the source geometry and aquifer condition.  Since F(x, 
y, z, T-τ) is selected, the spatial and temporal distribution of a groundwater plume concentration 
can be simulated by applying Gaussian quadrature to estimate Eq. (1) with given Cin(τ) and the 
sampling time.  Note that the left-hand side concentration of Eq. (1) may be dimensionless if 
Cin(τ) is represented by a dimensionless source release function.   
II. Simulated Annealing 
This section illustrates how SA determines the parameter values of the assumed function.  
The SA is a heuristic search method, and the algorithm of SA is in analogy to thermodynamics of 
liquids freezing and crystallizing.  If a hot liquid is cooled slowly, a pure crystal can be formed.  
This crystal is in the state of minimum energy for the system.  However, if the liquid is cooled 
quickly, the pure crystal may not be formed, and the system may then be in the state of a local 
minimum energy.  The energy probabilistic distribution of a system is expressed by Boltzmann 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
I. Sampling Concentrations 
The source release history is reconstructed through a two-step process.  The first step is to 
create the sampling concentrations at monitoring wells.  A scenario of groundwater 
contamination is employed to test the performance of the proposed approach.  A hypothetical 
release function of a nonreactive contaminant source is assumed as [1-3]

where 130, 150, and 190 are the source release times; 5, 10, and 7 are a measure of the spread of 
the release function; 1, 0.3, and 0.5 are the release strength of source.   
The dimensions of an area source are assumed as 5m × 5m.  The fundamental 
solution, ),,( τ−TyxF , is chosen based on source geometry and aquifer configuration.  The 
distribution of plume concentration can be computed based on Eqs. (1) and (6) with v = 1 m/day, 
Dx = 0.5 m2/day, and Dy = 0.05 m2/day; thus, the sampling concentration data are acquired.  
Figure 1 shows the spatial concentration distribution at 225 days along x axis for cases A (with 
infinite width) and case B for an aquifer width of 100 m.  The measurement points are assumed 
to taken from x = 0 m to x = 160 m with a uniform interval of 10m along the x axis.  Thus, 
totally 17 sampling concentration data are available for the reconstruction of the source release 
history.   
II. Two-Dimensional Plume Source Reconstruction 
The function-fitting technique is utilized to recover the release history with known source 
location.  Lin [11] mentioned that any continuous function on a closed and bounded interval can 
be closely approximated on that interval by exponential functions or polynomials to any degree of 
accuracy.  Therefore, the assumptive release function of the unknown sources can be expressed 
as [12]:

where k represents the number of source release waves, aj is the release strength of the source, tj 
is the release times of the source, and σj is the release width parameters of source.   
SA produces the trial values for parameters in Eq. (7), i.e., aj, tj, and σj.  The simulated 
concentrations are calculated by Eqs. (1) and (7) with those trial parameter values.  If 
minimizing the objective function, the optimal parameter values can be determined.  The 
objective function in SA is expressed as

CTi,sam is the sampling concentration measured at ith monitoring well at sampling time T, and n is 
 functions can be determined by the proposed approach based on the calculated value of the 
objective function.  The estimated results for cases A and B indicate that the proposed approach 
can accurately reconstruct the release history when compared with the hypothetic release function.  
In addition, the applications of the proposed method to two different aquifer configurations are 
also demonstrated.
