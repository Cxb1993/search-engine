        Figure 1.   Timing-driven X-based routing with obstacles.  
II.  PRELIMINARY 
A.  Motivation  
We observe that the X-based routing method will 
abridge the total wirelength (abbreviated as talL ) than the 
M-based routing method. However, no existing X-based 
method can construct the routing tree among obstacles. If 
we apply the sequential method, which first constructs 
routing tree without the obstacles and then removes the 
invalid edges, the final routing result will be limited by 
an initial routing tree. This is because we do not consider 
the obstacles advisably during the Steiner tree 
construction. Hence, we should consider the routing tree 
construction and the issue for obstacles simultaneously. 
Furthermore, previous X-based methods, which do not 
consider the timing issue, result in a serious detour 
routing. Hence, we apply the rerouting, which labels the 
critical nets and connects these critical nodes to source, 
to minimize the maximum source-to-terminal delay 
(abbreviated as maxD ). In fact, the rerouting will not 
result in that the rerouted terminals connect to the source 
directly because there are many existing edges and 
obstacles. By [1], we can improve the chip performance 
if the maxD is minimized. 
To simplify, we take the maximum 
source-to-terminal length (abbreviated as maxL ) to show 
the advantages of our proposed method. In Fig. 1(a) and 
(b), maxL of the sequential-based method and a spanning 
graph-based method are 33um and 29um. maxL of Fig. 
1(c) is 22.6 um but the detour routing is serious. Fig. 1(d) 
will result in additional wirelength but the maxL is 
reduced to 17.8 um. From the comparison, we can 
observe that the X-based rerouting method will minimize 
the maxD with considering the detour routing.  
B.  Modified X-based Elmore Delay Model 
 For a RC tree with a driver s , signal delay at node jt  is relative to wirelength and is figured as follows [16].

where P(s, tj) denotes the path from source s to terminal 
tj. ur and uc denote the resistance and capacitance of the 
edge between node u and its immediate predecessor. uC is 
the downstream capacitance of the tree at node u.  
 The delay for X-architecture is computed as follows,  
   j jdx dmα= ×                  (2) 
where jdx and jdm  denote the X-based and M-based 
delay, respectively. It is apparently that 0 1α≤ ≤  and we 
set α =1 in the paper. 
C.  Problem Definition  
Different from the traditional X-based algorithms 
[6][8][10] cannot handle the routing with obstacles, we 
propose the timing-driven routing tree construction 
which minimizes the maxD among the obstacles. Because 
we have no timing constraints of the benchmarks, the 
delay threshold (abbreviated as thd ) is taken as the 
constraints and described as follows, 
 
max   thd D r= ×                       (3) 
where maxD and r denote the maximum source-to-terminal 
and delay ratio ( 0 1r≤ ≤ ), respectively. For the critical 
nodes which their delays are over the thd , we reroute 
them to further reduce the maxD . The more descriptions 
for rerouting will be explained in Section III.   
According to the above discussion, the TOA-XSMT 
problem in this paper is defined as, 
   Given a set of obstacles and the terminals with a 
source position under the user-defined delay ratio r, the 
objective is to construct the TOA-XSMT which minimizes 
the maxD among the obstacles. 
III.  TIMING-DRIVEN X-ARCHITECTURE ROUTING TREE 
In this section, a timing-driven X-based routing tree 
construction is discussed and an example is utilized to 
explain this algorithm. Unlike a partition-based 
technique [17] is used to efficiently get the routing result, 
we explore a rerouting method for the critical terminals 
with the additional talL . To minimize the maxD , each 
critical sub-tree will be connected to the terminal near 
the source position. Our X-based routing tree 
construction is as follows.  
In first step, an initial X-based routing tree is 
constructed. A spanning graph is constructed according 
to the terminals and obstacles. For more details, please 
refer the [7]. The Kruskal-like algorithm is used to 
obtain the minimal spanning tree in a spanning graph. 
We further transform a spanning tree into an X-based 
routing tree. We estimate the delay of each node by the 
delay model mentioned in Section II-B. In second step, a 
rerouting algorithm is applied to minimize the maxD . We 
use a modified X-based Elmore model to estimate the 
arrival time for all nodes which contains the Steiner 
points and terminals. According to the user-defined thd , 
the critical nodes, which their delays are over thd , are 
rerouted. A proper edge is removed and we obtain the 
two disjoin sub-trees. One sub-tree includes a source and 
the non-critical nodes and the other sub-tree contains 
some critical nodes. Furthermore, a shortest path 
connecting two sub-trees is constructed. The rerouting 
algorithm iteratively splits and merges until all critical 
nodes are visited once.
