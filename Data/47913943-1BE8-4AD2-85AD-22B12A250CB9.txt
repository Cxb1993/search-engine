Abstract- In this paper, we compare deterministic  
Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) and 
Gold-code-based Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 
IDMA is a system that uses different interleavers to 
separate different users, but previously the interleaver is 
generated randomly and it is only compared to random 
sequences CDMA. Simulation results show that the 
deterministic–interleavers-based IDMA performance is as 
good as or better than Gold-code-based CDMA.  
Keywords: interleaver, CDMA, IDMA. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
CDMA is mainly limited by Multiple Access 
Interference (MAI), but the iterative decoding and the 
symbol-by-symbol PIC/MMSE Multi-User Detection 
(MUD) scheme that used in [1] helps CDMA mitigates 
MAI. 
Recently, an attractive multiple access system was 
proposed, so called IDMA [2]-[3]. An objective 
comparison of random-interleaver-based IDMA and 
random-sequence CDMA is made in [5]. Unlike 
CDMA system, IDMA uses different interleavers to 
distinguish each user’s signal. The MUD of IDMA 
only applies soft interference cancellation without 
MMSE instantaneous filter and is achieved by 
chip-by-chip (CBC) estimation algorithm, which 
requires significantly less complexity than CDMA, is a 
very low-cost detection scheme, because its MUD 
estimation’s complexity for each user is independent of 
the user number and this good property also remains in

multi-path environments because it only relates with 
channel taps. However, recently proposed schemes for 
IDMA uses randomly and independently generated 
interleaver to separate different user, thus the entire 
interleaving matrix has to be transmitted to the receiver 
which may seen to be infeasible and costly for 
implementation. 
A user-specific interleaver [6] was 
proposed for IDMA system, which use a 
master interleaver and by so called “power 
interleaver generation” method that 
accomplish by using master interleaver φ  to 
produce each users interleaver, for example, 
3( ) ( ( ( )))c cφ φ φ φ=  which has the same 
performance as random interleaver based 
IDMA, but in this paper, this master 
interleaver is still randomly generated and 
also the “power interleaver generation” 
method uses power method to produce other 
user’s interleaver index, which may cause 
time delay due to the increasing of user 
number while generating this kind of 
interleavers. 
In this paper, we employ deterministic interleaver 
[4] into IDMA to separate different user’s signal. By 
using this deterministic interleaver, the simulation 
results show that the deterministic interleaver based 
IDMA system outperforms or performs the same as 
CDMA in multi-path fading environment. 
The remainder of this letter is presented as follows. 
Section II presents the system model of 
deterministic-interleaver-based IDMA. Then the 
applied deterministic interleaver generation used in this 
letter is briefly summarized in section III. The BER 
performance comparison is presented in section IV, and 
we conclude this letter in section V. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
We briefly summarize the system model 
in [5] in this section. Previous IDMA papers 
[2]-[3] didn’t write IDMA system model in 
matrix form. Thus we use the system model in 
[5] to compare IDMA and CDMA in unified 
matrix form. 
We consider the baseband discrete-time system 
model in Fig. 1. 
kb  is the information bit of user k, 
k=1,…,K, where K is the number of users. 
kb  is

k is an odd arbitrarily integer, then we have D 
index sequence for a integer k. 
Step3: the index mapping function d is given 
by circularly right shift the D index sequence 
as follows:  
1(mod ): ,0m m Nd c c m N+ < <a , 
The last element must be mapped back to the 
first element. 
Step 4: maps D into d as the interleaver index 
D’ for each user by setting an odd arbitrarily 
integer k in (4). 
Example:  
Step 1: 0c =0. 
Step 2: D = ).4,5,7,2,6,3,1,0(),...,,( 710 =ccc  
Step 3: d = (4,0,1,3,6,2,7,5). 
Step 4: D’ = (1,3,7,6,0,4,2,5).The 0-th element 
of D is 0 and the 0-the element of D is 4, so 0 
is the 4-th element of D. 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In the following simulations, we will illustrate the 
performance of deterministic interleaver based IDMA 
and CDMA in Rayleigh fading channel. Block of 32 
information bits are encoded by rate 1/2 and memory 2 
convolutional code with generator polynomial [7, 
5]8 ,the trellis for this convolutional encoder is 
terminated by 2 zero bits to return to all zero states, and 
thus resulting 68 coded bits. For deterministic 
interleaver based IDMA the coded bits are then spread 
by the length 8 spreading code, each user uses the same 
spreading code. Therefore, the interleaver size of πk is 
68x8=544. The spreading code for CDMA is length 7 
Gold codes that used in [1] for K=4 and the interleaver 
is generated randomly and independently for each user. 
The simulation parameters for random interleaver 
based IDMA and random sequence CDMA are the 
same as deterministic interleaver based IDMA and 
Gold code CDMA, respectively, except that the 
interleavers and spreading sequences are generated 
randomly and independently. 
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show that the BER performance of 
deterministic interleaver based IDMA and random 
interleaver based IDMA and Gold code CDMA in 
Rayleigh fading channel at the same condition except 
that Fig. 4 uses  path=3 and Fig. 5 uses path=1, 
respectively. We can see that our proposed system 
performance is almost the same with random 
interleaver based IDMA, and the performance is 
extremely better than Gold code CDMA in Fig. 5 
because the reason of path-diversity.
