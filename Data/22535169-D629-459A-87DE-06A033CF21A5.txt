Abstract
Let D = (V,A) be a digraph. A set S of vertices is a kernel if S is independent and
every vertex in V \ S has an out-neighbor in S. The kernel problem is to find a kernel of
D of minimum cardinality. The concept of kernels in digraphs can be applied to numerous
fields of research such as logic, game theory, computational complexity, artificial intelligence,
graph theory, combinatorics, and code theory. Recently a new interest for the study of kernels
emerged from the applications to counterexamples to the zero-one laws in fragments of monadic
second-order logic.
In this project, we study the kernel problem and its variations such as k-kernel, {k}-kernel,
signed kernel, and minus kernel problems for some classes of digraphs. We also study the
k-fold independent, {k}-independent, signed independent and minus independent domination
problems for some classes of undirected graphs. The goals set to be achieved by the project are
as follows:
1. Develop polynomial-time algorithms for the kernel problem on the following 9 classes of
digraphs: asteroidal triple-free digraphs, block digraphs, interval digraphs, chordal di-
graphs, permutation digraphs, distance-hereditary digraphs, Helly circular-arc digraphs,
superorientations of graphs of bounded branchwidth k, and superorientations of graphs of
bounded cliquewidth k.
2. Investigate the relationship between the kernel number of directed n-paths (respectively,
n-cycles, n-cliques, n-wheels, n-fans, n-pans, and n-suns) and the domination number of
the corresponding underlying graphs.
During the period from August 1st, 2010 to July 31st, 2011, we have achieved all goals men-
tioned above for the project. The achievements lead to four papers. Among them, one has been
published in Ars Combinatora (SCI-indexed Journal Paper). Recently, one of the other papers
has been accepted by Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing
(EI-indexed Journal Paper).

1 前言介紹與文獻探討
We start by introducing the fundamental terminology and notation for undirected and directed
graphs. Unless stated otherwise, all undirected (respectively, directed) graphs considered in
this project are finite, without self-loops, and parallel edges(respectively, arcs). Besides, it is
understood that an undirected graph (respectively, a directed graph) has n vertices and m edges
(respectively, arcs) if nothing else is stated. For definitions of graph classes or their properties
not given in this project we refer to [16].
1.1 Undirected Graphs
We use G = (V,E) to denote an undirected graph with vertex set V and edge set E. The
elements v ∈ V are called vertices of G, whereas the elements e ∈ E are referred to as edges of
G. Each edge is an unordered pair of vertices. For an edge e = (v, w), v and w are said the
endvertices of e. We also use V (G) and E(G) to denote the vertex set and the edge set of G,
respectively. Two edges are parallel if they have the same endvertices. We use G[W ] to denote a
subgraph of G induced by a subsetW of V . For any vertex v ∈ V, the open neighborhood of v in
G is NG(v) = {u ∈ V | (u, v) ∈ E} and the closed neighborhood of v in G is NG[v] = N(v)∪{v}.
The degree of a vertex v in G, denoted by degG(v), is the number of edges incident with v. If
degG(v) = 0, then v is an isolated vertex of G. The minimum degree of G, denoted by δ(G),
is the minimum degree of a vertex of G. A clique is a subset of pairwise adjacent vertices of
V . A maximal clique is a clique that is not a proper subset of any other clique. We use C(G)
to denote the collection of all maximal cliques of G. A clique is maximum if there is no clique
of G of larger cardinality. The clique number of G, denoted by ω(G), is the cardinality of a
maximum clique of G.
1.2 Directed Graphs
A directed graph (or just digraph) D = (V,A) is a pair consisting of vertex set V and arc set A.
The vertex set and arc set of D are also denoted by V (D) and A(D), respectively. For an arc
〈u, v〉 in D, the first vertex u is its tail and the second vertex v is its head ; v is an out-neighbor
of u and u is an in-neighbor of v; u and v are adjacent . The set of out-neighbors of a vertex v
in D is denoted by N+D (v) and the set of in-neighbors of v in D by N
−
D (v). The set of neighbors
of v is defined as ND(v) = N
+
D (v)∪N−D (v). The in-degree (respectively, out-degree) of v in D is
1
the token to a position outside the kernel. For more information on important applications of
kernels in game theory, refer to [39, 40, 79].
Besides game theory, the concept of kernels can be applied to numerous fields of research
such as logic, computational complexity, artificial intelligence, graph theory, combinatorics, and
code theory [7, 10]. For example, sets of coherent arguments in multi-agents systems [19, 30]
and semantics (or a system of rules) in default logic [24] can be expressed as kernels or their
variations in digraphs. Few years ago, a new interest for the study of kernels emerged from the
applications in finite model theory. The core topics of finite model theory include expressive
power, descriptive complexity, and zero-one laws. Goranko and Kapron [44] showed that frame
satisfiability of propositional modal logic can be expressed as some variations of kernels. Le
Bars [68] proved that the zero-one law fails for this logic. For more information on recent
applications to counterexamples to the zero-one laws in fragments of monadic second-order
logic, see, e.g., [67, 68].
1.4 Concepts related to Kernels: Domination and Independent
Domination
The concept of independent dominating sets in undirected graphs is similar to that of kernels in
digraphs. Let G = (V,E) be a finite, simple, undirected graph. A subset S of V is a dominating
set of G if any vertex in V − S has a neighbor in S. If S is also an independent set, then S is
called an independent dominating set of G. The independent domination problem is to find an
independent dominating set of G of minimum cardinality. The independent domination number
of G, denoted by γi(G), is the minimum cardinality of an independent dominating set of G. It
is clear that an independent dominating set of an undirected graph G is a kernel of the digraph
D obtained from G by replacing every edge (x, y) by the pair 〈x, y〉, 〈y, x〉 of arcs. Therefore, a
minimum kernel of D corresponds to a minimum independent dominating set of G.
Independent domination is a variant of domination. Domination is a fundamental concept
in graph theory. It plays an important role as an often studied graph optimization problem.
In algorithmic graph theory, a huge number of efficient algorithms has been developed for the
computation of various types of dominating sets. In 1990, a special issue of Discrete Mathemat-
ics was entirely devoted to domination [51]. In 1998, two books dedicated to domination were
published [49, 50]. The study of domination on graphs has extensively grown partly because its
3
problem, {k}-domination problem, the signed domination problem, and the minus domination
problem are the most studied ones.

Definition 1. For a fixed positive integer k, a k-tuple dominating set of a graph G = (V,E)
is a subset D of V such that |NG[v] ∩ D| ≥ k for all vertices v ∈ V . The k-tuple domination
number of G, denoted by γ×k(G), is the minimum cardinality of a k-tuple dominating set of G.
Definition 2. A signed dominating function of a graph G = (V,E) is a function f : V →
{−1, 1} such that f(NG[v]) ≥ 1 for all vertices v ∈ V . The signed domination number of G is
γs(G) = min{f(V ) | f is a signed dominating function of G}.
Definition 3. A minus dominating function of a graph G = (V,E) is a function f : V →
{−1, 0, 1} such that f(NG[v]) ≥ 1 for all vertices v ∈ V . The minus domination number of G is
γ−(G) = min{f(V ) | f is a minus dominating function of G}.

order n has a kernel with at most k vertices. Moreover, if D has a kernel of size at most k,
the algorithms can find a minimum kernel of D. Manuel et al. [71] introduced a variation of
the kernel problem called strong kernel problem in 2009. They showed that the strong kernel
problem is polynomial-time solvable for oriented circulant graphs. Kernels in some classes of
planar digraphs were investigated in [5].
Other than the above-mentioned results, very few algorithms results exist concerning kernels
or the kernel number of a digraph. Most papers deal with the existence of a kernel. Richardson
stated [75] that every digraph without a directed odd cycle has a kernel, and the proof led to an
algorithm to find one. Chva´tal proved (see [43]) that the problem of deciding whether a digraph
has a kernel is NP-complete. Fraenkel [39] showed that the kernel problem remains NP-complete
even for planar digraphs D with degree constraints d+D(x) ≤ 2, d−D(x) ≤ 2 and dD(x) ≤ 3 for
7
Assume that x and y are two distinct vertices in S. If x and y were adjacent, they would be
included in some maximal clique C and thus f(C) ≥ 2, contradicting the assumption that f is
a Y -independent dominating function of G. Therefore, x and y are not adjacent. Then, the set
S is an independent set of G.
Following the discussion above, the minimum weight of a Y -independent dominating function
of G with Y = {0, 1} is equal to the independent domination number of G. 
Following Lemma 1, an independent dominating set of an undirected graph G can be viewed
as a Y -independent dominating function f with Y = {0, 1}. In this case, the function f is
called an independent dominating function of G. Then, the independent dominating number of
G is equal to the minimum weight of an independent dominating function of G. The concept is
similar to [1]. It motivates us to study the following variations of the independent domination
problem.
Definition 6. For a fixed positive integer k, a k-fold independent dominating function of a
graph G = (V,E) is a function f : V → {0, 1} such that f(NG[v]) ≥ k for all vertices v ∈ V ,
and f(C) ≤ k for every C ∈ C(G). The k-fold independent domination number of G, denoted
by γi,k(G), is the minimum weight of a k-fold independent dominating function of G.
Definition 7. A signed independent dominating function of a graph G = (V,E) is a func-
tion f : V → {−1, 1} such that f(NG[v]) ≥ 1 for all vertices v ∈ V , and f(C) ≤ 1 for
every C ∈ C(G). The signed independent domination number of G is γsi (G) = min{f(V ) |
f is a signed independent dominating function of G}.
Definition 8. A minus independent dominating function of a graph G = (V,E) is a func-
tion f : V → {−1, 0, 1} such that f(NG[v]) ≥ 1 for all vertices v ∈ V , and f(C) ≤ 1 for
every C ∈ C(G). The minus independent domination number of G is γ−i (G) = min{f(V ) |
f is a minus independent dominating function of G}.
Definition 9. For a fixed nonnegative integer k, a {k}-independent dominating function of a
graph G = (V,E) is a function f : V → {0, 1, 2, . . . , k} such that f(NG[v]) ≥ k for all vertices
v ∈ V , and f(C) ≤ k for every C ∈ C(G). The {k}-independent domination number of G is
γi,{k}(G) = min{f(V ) | f is a {k}-independent dominating function of G}.
Definition 10. The k-fold independent domination (respectively, {k}-independent domination,
signed independent domination, and minus independent domination) problem is to find a k-fold
9
Definition 14. For a fixed nonnegative integer k, a {k}-kernel function of a graph D = (V,A)
is a function f : V → {0, 1, 2, . . . , k} such that f(N+D (v) ∪ {v}) ≥ k for all vertices v ∈ V , and
f(C) ≤ k for every C ∈ C(D). The {k}-kernel number of D is κ{k}(G) = min{f(V ) | f is a
{k}-kernel function of D}.
Definition 15. The k-kernel problem is to find a k-kernel of a graph G of minimum cardinality.
The {k}-kernel (respectively, signed kernel and minus kernel) problem is to find a {k}-kernel
(respectively, signed kernel and minus kernel) function of a graph D of minimum weight.
Definition 16. The k-kernel problem is to find a k-kernel function of a digraph D of minimum
cardinality. The {k}-independent domination (respectively, signed independent domination and
minus independent domination) problem is to find a {k}-independent dominating (respectively,
signed independent dominating and minus independent dominating) function of a graph G of
minimum weight.
It is clear that κi(G) = κi,1(G) = κi,{1}(G) for a graph G.
