various strategies have been employed to deal 
with the time-delay problem in the 
temperature loop. The Smith predictor (Smith 
1957) has been perhaps the most widely used 
technique for a long period of time. The basic 
idea for the Smith predictor is to take the 
time-delay term out of the temperature loop so 
that it can be ignored in the controller design. 
However, application of the Smith predictor 
needs to know precise system model. Once the 
system parameters contain uncertainties, the 
performance of the controller might become 
unsatisfactory. In practical applications, in 
addition to the parameter uncertainties, the 
system may have external disturbances which 
further deteriorate the performance. Some 
researches gave improvements to the Smith 
predictor design. Tien (2000) proposed to 
combine the Smith predictor with the 
repetitive controller to overcome the 
time-delay effect as well as the periodic 
disturbance. Logemann and Townley (1997) 
suggested to update the gain for the integral 
term using some adaptive strategy such that 
the performance of the Smith predictor can be 
improved. However, it still needs the 
knowledge of the system parameters. Chen 
and Yang (2007) proposed a fuzzy-Smith 
controller to have better performance in the 
temperature loop. 
PID controllers are widely used in the 
temperature applications. It needs no 
information of the system parameters, but with 
3 parameters to be tuned. The famous 
Ziegler-Nichols (1942) method can give 
acceptable controller parameters after some 
simple experiments. Yusof (1994) proposed a 
self-tuner for temperature systems based on 
PID control which can switch to proper 
controller gains under different operation 
conditions. Moon (2007) realized a multi-loop 
PID design for a temperature control system. 
A new gain tuning law was proposed by Ahn 
et al (2008) for temperature control system to 
give improved performance. Moon and Lee 
(2000) integrated the fuzzy reasoning and PID 
law so that the nonlinearities are taken care of 
by the fuzzy design while the linear dynamics 
is regulated by the PID control. Zeng et al 
(2008) also used fuzzy-PID controller to 
control the temperature variable to have proper 
robustness. Lopez et al (2009) developed a PI 
controller incorporated with the high-order 
sliding dynamics to prevent possible 
temperature fluctuation near the setpoint. Lin et 
al (1999) designed an ANN+Fuzzy control 
architecture for a water bath system to reduce 
the learning time. Khalid and Omatu (1991) 
integrated ANN and MRAC to tolerate large 
variations on system parameters. Lu and Tsai 
(2008) used recurrent ANN to implement an 
adaptive predictive controller to deal with 
external disturbance problem in a temperature 
loop. 
 Some auto-tuning controllers are avilable in 
the market. Most of them are based on adaptive 
strategies under various limitations such as 
limited system order, time invariance in system 
parameters, and limited allowable delay time. 
Other set of auto-tuning controllers are based on 
the intelligent control theory, and hence, a 
significant learning time is a must before any 
actual on-line control. A common problem for 
these controllers is their lack of rigorous proof 
in closed loop stability.  
 In this project, we propose a function 
approximation based adaptive controller to 
tolerate various uncertainties and disturbances in 
the temperature control system such that good 
performance can be obtained. No learning phase 
is needed in our design before the on-line 
operation. The closed loop stability is proved by 
using Lyapunov’s stability theory. Justifications 
are done with computer simulations as well as 
experimental verifications. 
 
2. Modeling of Temperature Systems  
 The dynamics of a temperature system in a 
control volume can be described by a first order 
system as 
 )( outin QQCT −=&  
where Qin is the input of the thermal energy,  
Qout is the output of the thermal energy, and C is 
a constant. This equation says that the variation 
of the temperature inside the control volume is 
proportional to the difference between the input 
and output of the thermal energy. This 
relationship can also be written in a formal 
transfer function like

This is exactly the bound for the tracking error 
which can be regarded as the transient 
performance analysis for the control system. It 
can be observed that the tracking error is 
exactly exponentially convergent to the ultimate 
bound in the steady state we have proved before. 
This completes the derivation of the controller 
as well as the analysis of the closed-loop 
stability and the performance.  
 
4. Experimental Study 
 An experimental setup is designed to have 
a temperature system whose time-delay is 16 
seconds which is defined as the time when the 
thermal couple gets temperature variation after 
the heater activation. An IBM-PC compatible is 
used as the controller under the DOS 
environment to ensure the hard real-time 
performance. The controller sends the control 
input via a D/A converter so that a SCR is able 
to regulate the current to the heater. The SCR is 
a product of Maxthermo Inc. with the part 
number MPS0202. A bridge circuit is designed 
to connect the thermal couple to the A/D 
converter.  
 Two temperature regulation cases are 
tested. One is for Co200  regulation and the 
other for Co50  regulation. The former is easier 
to control, because the large temperature gradient 
between the system and the ambient enables fast 
cooling when the actual temperature is over the 
setpoint. This largely alleviates the asymmetric 
property inherent in the system. The PID control 
result is shown in Figure 1 which gives about 5% 
overshoot and a 4% steady state error. The steady 
state error seems to be decreasing, but the 
converging rate is far too slow. It is noted that the 
PID gains are tuned to give the best performance 
we can have and which is a painstaking task. On 
the other hand, the regulation result with the 
proposed controller is shown in Figure 2. It is 
seen that there is almost no overshoot in the 
transient and the steady state error is not obvious. 
For the low temperature regulation case, since the 
temperature gradient is small, the control in not 
easy. The PID result is shown in Figure 3. A 12% 
overshoot is present and the output is zigzagging 
around the setpoint with large amplitude after 
900 seconds which is not shown here. Again, this 
is the best performance we can have by simply 
tuning the gains. The control performance of the 
proposed controller is presented in Figure 4. 
There is only a 6% overshoot can be observed 
and the trajectory converges to the setpoint 
gradually. The slow convergent is coming from 
the asymmetry and large time-delay inherent in 
the system dynamics.  
 
5. Conclusions  
In this project, we have designed an adaptive 
controller to learn the dynamics of a temperature 
system which contains various uncertainties, 
external disturbances, large time-delay and 
asymmetric behavior. The on-line learning 
capability enables the proposed controller to be 
ready to face the fast deploy requirement in the 
industrial applications. The rigorous 
mathematical derivation proves the closed loop 
stability and boundedness of the internal 
variables. The experimental studies justify the 
efficacy of the proposed scheme.
