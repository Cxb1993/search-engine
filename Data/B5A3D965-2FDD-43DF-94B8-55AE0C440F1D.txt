Abstract 
     Personal Communication Network (PCN) is an emerging wireless network 
that promises many new services for the telecommunication industry. The high 
speed backbone network (ATM or WDM) is one possible approach to provide 
broadband wireless transmission with PCN’s using the ATM switching networks 
for interconnection of PCN cells. The wireless ATM backbone network design 
problem is that of allocating backbone links among ATM switches to reduce the 
effects of terminal mobility on the performance of ATM-based PCN’s. In this 
project, the wireless ATM backbone network design 
(WABND) problem is formulated and studied. The goal of the WABND is to 
minimize the location update cost under constraints. Since WABND is NP-hard, 
several heuristic algorithms, a genetic algorithm, and a simulated annealing 
algorithm are proposed to solve it. These algorithms are used to find the 
close-to-optimal solution. Simulated results show that the proposed algorithms are 
able to achieve good performance. 
 
 
1.導論 
    個人通訊網路(Personal Communication Network, PCN)是
一個提供許多新型態服務且即時的無線通訊網路。使用者透過
個人通訊網路，即使在行動中仍然能夠透過無線的連結來存取
網路所提供資訊交換的相關服務。而這些資訊交換的服務包含
視訊、音訊、資料與影像的傳送均可以做即時且雙向的傳輸
[1][2][3][4]。 
    近來，數位無線通訊服務的快速成長刺激了新一代行動交
換網路骨幹架構的提升與整合。要使無線通訊(包含無線區域網
路、個人通訊服務等)的通訊品質提升，除了無線傳輸技術、無
線傳輸協定、與傳輸設備在功能與速度的不斷提升與創新外，
提供高頻寬的骨幹網路是一個極為重要的因素。先前，許多研
究者擴充非同步傳輸模式的技術，以便能應用於無線通訊 
(wireless communication) 環境，建置所謂 wireless-ATM(WATM)
環境，在 WATM 上的許多議題已引起廣泛的興趣與研究[5]。
而其主要的動機與目的是：在無線通訊網路與非同步傳輸模式
網路之間，設計一個完整無接縫的(seamless)連結；及提升在實
際生活中對於行動多媒體之服務的品質。在[5]中所提出的
WATM 架構中(如圖一)，其中傳統個人通訊網路的基地台控制
器(Base station controller, BSC)被省略而基地台(Base Station, 
BS or Cell)直接連接至 ATM 骨幹網路的交換器上。原本應由
BSC 提供的行動控制與管理功能則移至 BS 且/或 ATM 的交換
器上。但因為此兩種網路在先天本質上的差異，此兩種網路的
整合有許多的挑戰要面對。包含在 ATM 網路上，於使用者行
動同時要能建立使用者間點對點的連線（connection），要能夠
處理無線連結通訊時較高錯誤率（error rate），配置基地台的位
置，決定基地台到交換器（switch）上的連結、行動管理、流
量控制等問題。 
 
圖一. 以 ATM 為骨幹網路的 PCN 架構。 
在設計 PCN 網路時，一般電話公司會先決定所要提供服
務的覆蓋範圍(Coverage Area)，再依據覆蓋範圍內行動通訊者
的使用量與分配的通訊頻道，決定如何將整體的服務區域
(global service area)切割成較小的覆蓋區域(coverage area)，其
中每一個覆蓋區域稱為一個細胞(cell)由一個基地台與使用者
間透過無線訊號的傳送來提供服務。因為使用者所持用之手持
裝置(手機、個人數位助理等設備)的傳輸功率有限，使用者僅
能與部分的基地台做通訊。接著，建置蜂巢式系統與基地台，
並將數個相鄰基地台的覆蓋區域組成一個位置區域(location 
area, LA)。配置骨幹網路、配置交換器、連結骨幹網路。最後
再將基地台指派與連接到交換器完成 wireless ATM 的網路架
構。 
一個建置於 ATM 骨幹網路之上典型的 PCN 架構如圖
（二）所示，整個覆蓋的區域被分割成一些不相交(disjoint)的
叢集(cluster)或位置區域(LA)。每一個叢集中會配置一個 ATM
的交換器，在此叢集中的所有基地台便以光纖連至 ATM 交換
器上，此交換器負責此叢集中使用者需求之頻道的建立或釋
放。負責連接基地台與交換器間的光纖為區域連結 (local 
link)；而交換器與交換器兼了連結則稱為骨幹連結(backbone 
link)[3]。骨幹網路(backbone network)包含區域連結與骨幹連
結，而骨幹網路的設計良窳攸關整體的傳輸效能。

定性日亦受到重視。基於以上討論，骨幹網路的設計良窳影響
到無線環境的通訊品質，是值得重視的議題。本計畫的第一部
份中首先考量無線與有線網路整合時網路骨幹設計的問題。所
討論的骨幹網路並不限於 ATM，亦可以適用於 WDM 等其他
更先進之網路。給定一個 PCN、每一個基地台與基地台間的單
位時間換手的頻率、基地台與交換器間的連結、每一個交換器
於設計骨幹網路時的最大分之度限制，與骨幹連結的總個數；
如何利用給定的骨幹連結數設計一個互連的(connected)骨幹網
路，在交換器分支度的限制下，使得網路通訊成本最小。定義
此問題為無線非同步傳輸網路骨幹網路設計問題。 
     
2.問題定義

1. Introduction
Personal Communication Network (PCN) [1]–[3] is an
emerging wireless network that promises many new ser-
vices. Users may move from one place to another and
can maintain transparent network access through wireless
links. Information exchanging between users, may be bidi-
rectional, which includes voice, data, and image.
In a PCN, the covered geographical area is typically
partitioned into a set of cells. Each cell has a base sta-
tion(BS) to exchange radio signals with mobile terminals.
Due to the limited power of wireless transceivers, mobile
users can communicate only with base stations that reside
within the same cell. Moreover, several coverage areas of
cells are grouped and formed a location area(LA). That is,
an LA consists of an aggregation of coverage areas of cells
forming a contiguous geographical region.
A typical PCN architecture based on ATM switches is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The covered geographical area is parti-
tioned into a set P = {P1, P2, ..., Pm} of m disjoint clusters
(or LAs). An ATM switch is allocated within each cluster
and each BS in this cluster is connected to one of the ports of
this ATM switch. The ATM switch oﬀers the services of es-
tablishing/releasing channels for the mobile terminals in the
cluster. Two neighboring clusters can be interconnected via

the associated ATM switches. The links between the ATM
switches are called backbone links, and the links between
ATM switches and BSs are called local links [3].
When a subscriber enters a cell that belongs to a dif-
ferent LA, a location update (LU) or handoﬀ procedure
that informs the network about the subscriber’s new location
is performed. This will generate network traﬃc overhead
in PCN and consume scarce radio resources. Moreover,
LU also increases the load on distributed location databases
and, thus, increases the complexity of implementing the
databases [4], [5].
During the wireless environment, two types of hand-
oﬀs should be considered in the designing of the network,
they are inter-switch handoﬀ and intra-switch handoﬀ . The
intra-switch handoﬀ involves only one switch and the inter-
switch handoﬀ involves two switches. The inter-switch
handoﬀs that occur between two cells, which connected to
diﬀerent switches, consume much more network resources
(therefore, are much more costly) than the intra-switch
handoﬀ that occur between cells, which connected to the
same switch [6]–[9]. Thus, the cost of intra-switch hand-
oﬀs involving only one switch is negligible in designing the
two-level wireless ATM network.
Consider the example shown in Fig. 1, where cells A
and B are connected to switch s1, and cells C and D are
connected to switch s2. If the subscriber moves from cell
B to cell A, switch s1 will perform a handoﬀ for this call.
This intra-switch handoﬀ is relatively simple and does not
involve any location update in the databases that record the
position of the subscriber. The handoﬀ also does not in-
volve any network entity other than switch s1. Now imagine
that the subscriber moves from cell B to cell C. Then the
inter-switch handoﬀ involves the execution of a fairly com-
plicated protocol between switches s1 and s2 [6]–[9].

In this paper, the designing problem of allocating the
backbone links among the ATM switches with the objective
that minimizes the cost of location update under the degree
constraint is studied. With the above definition, the wire-
less ATM backbone network design(WABND) problem can
be formally defined as follows:

m×m matrix LUS S , and positive integers deg and p, deg 
|S | and |S | − 1  p  |F |, the WABND problem is to find
a connected subgraph G(S , E, z) of H with |E| = p, such
that the location update cost ∑mk=1
∑m
l=1 LUS S (k, l) × dkl is
minimized and satisfies the constraint deg(G)  deg, where
dkl is the minimal communication cost between sk and sl on
G(S , E, z).
2.3 ILP Formulation
The WABND problem can be formulated as integer pro-
gram. Define Fi j=1, if the link (i, j) between switches
si and s j is in graph H; Fi j=0, otherwise. Note that,∑m
i=1
∑m
j=1 Fi j = |F |, and the value Fi j is known and fixed.
Let xi j=1, if the link (i, j) between switches si and s j is se-
lected as a backbone link; xi j=0, otherwise. Let ci j be the
cost of the link (i, j) in F. Let ykli j = 1, if the shortest path
between switches sk and sl pass the link (i, j); ykli j = 0, oth-
erwise.
The following is an integer programming formulation
of the problem:

The backbone network must be a connected graph, the
reachability from one switch to any switch is ensured this
way. The graph G is partitioned into two connected parts, X
and Y . It can be observed that there must be at least an edge
going from X to Y for each feasible solution. Otherwise, the
switches in Y cannot be reached. The reachability of graph
G is stated as
∑
i∈X, j∈Y
xi j  1,∀ partition X and Y of G. (13)
There are 2m ways to partition a graph, so the number
of constraints is in the order of 2m. Constraint (13) is sat-
isfied by all feasible solutions, and vice versa, any solution
in which there exist unreachable switch must violate at least
one of them.
2.4 Related Works
Given the PCN, handoﬀ frequencies of cells in PCN, the
connected ATM backbone network, and the capacities of
switches, Merchant and Sengupta [6] formulated the cell as-
signment problem and considered the problem of assigning
cells to switches (determined local links) in wireless ATM
network and several extended studies has been explored [7]–
[9].
Huang and Wang [3] investigated the design problem
of allocating the backbone links among the ATM switches
with the objective of reducing the eﬀect of terminal mobility
on the performance of wireless PCN’s. The problem, which
is called the Link Allocation Problem (LAP) on ATM-based
PCN, is known NP-complete [3]. Formally, given a graph
H(S , F, z = 1) and positive integers deg and p, deg  |S | and
|S | − 1  p  |F |, the LAP is to find a connected subgraph
G = (S , E) of H with |E| = p, such that the diameter(=
max∀sk ,sl∈S {dkl}) of the graph G is minimized and deg(G) 
deg. Two eﬃcient heuristic algorithms were proposed in
[3], [10] to solve the LAP.
The Optimal Communication spanning Tree (OCT)
problem [11] is similar to LAP problem and defined as
follows. Let H(S , F, z) be an undirected graph with non-
negative edge length function z. Given the requirements
λ(sk, sl) for each pair of nodes sk and sl. For any span-
ning tree T of H, the communication cost of T is defined
as
∑
∀sk ,sl λ(sk, sl) × dkl. The goal of OCT is to construct a
spanning tree T with the minimal communication cost. Like
other constrained spanning tree problem, OCT problem is
NP-hard [12]. The current best approximation ratio for the
OCT problem is due to Yair Bartal’s algorithms which ap-
proximate arbitrary metrics by tree metrics [13]. Recently,
in [14], genetic algorithm with tree chromosome was devel-
oped to find the near-optimal solution.
The Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree
(DCMST) on a graph is the problem of generating a min-
imum cost spanning tree with degree constraints. By reduc-
ing it to an equivalent symmetric TSP, Garey and Johnson
[12] showed that the DCMST is NP-hard. Several stud-
ies about DCMST on complexity, performance of approx-
imation algorithms and worst case performance guarantees
were described in [15]–[17]. In [16], three heuristics for the
DCMST, including simulated annealing, a genetic algorithm
and a method based on problem space search were proposed.

Fig. 3 Topology chromosome: (a) degree-tree gene (DTG) and augment-
edge gene (AEG). (b) Chromosomal coding of Fig. 2(b).
• With the help of appropriate data structures, the en-
coding and decoding can be carried out eﬃciently in
O(n log n) operations.
• Each tree has a unique Pru¨fer number and hence a
unique encoding.
In WABND, the backbone network can be divided into
two parts, a spanning tree and a set of the augmented edges.
Because the advantages on structure feasibility and degree-
constrained of the Pru¨fer number, it is suited to be used
to encode the spanning tree of the WABND problem. To
solve the WABND problem, the backbone network is en-
coded into a topology chromosome which consists of two
types of genes: degree-tree gene and augment-edge gene.
• degree-tree gene (DTG): The DTG is an array of inte-
gers in {1, 2, ..., m} with size m− 2 denoted as DTG[i],
i=1, 2, ..., m−2, which is used to represent the spanning
tree in H.
• augment-edge gene (AEG): The AEG is an array of
pairs of nodes (or edge) in {1, 2, ..., m} with size
2 × (p − m + 1) which denoted as AEG[i][ j], i=1,
2, ..., p − m + 1; j=1 or 2. Each pair of integers
(AEG[i][1], AEG[i][2]) is used to represent the two
endpoints of the selected augmented edge.
The structure of the degree-tree gene and the augment-
edge gene are explained in Fig. 3(a). A possible encoding of
the example shown in Fig. 2(b) is showed in Fig. 3(b). The
Pru¨fer decoding and encoding algorithms are used to trans-
fer the DTG to a spanning tree and transfer the spanning tree
to a DTG, respectively. Obviously, DTG be the high-level
gene; that is, the content of DTG does eﬀect the contents
of the augment-edge gene (AEG). Once the spanning tree
represented by the DTG is changed, the AEG should be up-
dated according to the content of DTG.
4.2 Initial Population
By using the DTG and AEG to represent the backbone
topology, it can be ensured that there is no structural in-
feasibleness in the topology chromosome of the proposed
GA. In other words, all representations are always candi-
date connected subgraphs. However, if the contents of the
DTG and AEG are randomly generated, then the topology
chromosome may be infeasible with respect to the degree
constraints. A possible way to tackle this problem is that a
testing algorithm should be developed to examine the degree
of each switch in the topology chromosome. Because the
number of generated topology chromosomes may be very
large, the usage of testing method will increase the run-
ning time. Another way is that only constraint-satisfy topol-
ogy chromosome is generated. If the topology chromosome
generated by system is constraint-satisfied then the perfor-
mance of GA can be improved. Thus, in this paper, only the
topology chromosomes which represented connected net-
works and satisfied the degree-constraint are generated by
performing the ICG (Initial chromosome generation) algo-
rithm. The ICG algorithm is described as follows.
ICG: Initial Chromosome Generation
set degree(sk)=1, ∀k;
for i = 1 to m-2 begin
random select a switch s j;
while (degree(s j)  deg) random select a switch s j;
set DTG[i] = s j; degree(s j)++;
end
call decode algorithm to transfer DTG to a tree T ;
A = H − T ; k = 1;
while (A  ∅ ) and (k  p − m + 1) begin
random select an edge e = (si, s j) in A;
while (degree(s j) = deg) or (degree(si) = deg)
begin
A = A − e; random select an edge e = (si, s j) in A;
end
set AEG[k][1] = si; AEG[k][2] = s j;
degree(si)++; degree(s j)++;
A = A − e; T = T ∪ e; k++;
end
Obviously, the topology chromosome generated by
the ICG algorithm represents a candidate solution for the
WABND problem, since it guarantees to be a degree-
constrained connected subnetwork with |T | = p.
4.3 Genetic Crossover Operator
Five types of crossover operators are considered in this pa-
per:
(1) Single point crossover on DTG (SPC DTG): Two
DTG (say DTG1 and DTG2) are randomly selected for
crossover from previous generation and then a random in-
teger i is generated in the range [1,m − 2]. This number is
used as the crossover point. To create new oﬀspring, first,
all elements between i and m − 2 in these genes of two par-
ents are swapped and children C1 and C2 are generated (as
shown in Fig. 4(a)).
(2) Two points crossover on DTG (TPC DTG): The op-
eration is the same as the SPC DTG except two crossover
points i and j are selected in the range [1,m − 2] (as shown
in Fig. 4(b)).
(3) Path-crossover [16], [26], [27] on DTG: For a set of
parents, DTG1 and DTG2, consider every possible single-
point crossovers, thus 2 × (m − 3) oﬀspring are constructed.
After performing CAA for each oﬀspring, the best oﬀspring

where Cmax denotes the maximum value observed, so
far, of the cost function in the population. Let cost is the
value of the cost function for the chromosome; Cmax can
be calculated by the following iterative equation: Cmax =
max{Cmax, cost}, where Cmax is initialized to zero.
4.7 Replacement Strategy
Initially, assume Npopulation be the number chromosomes to
be generated and Nparent topology chromosomes are ran-
domly constructed. In the process of selection, Npopulation/2
pairs of connections are randomly selected for crossover
to generate the new generation of chromosomes. After
crossover, chromosomes are sorted according to the fit-
ness function in increasing order, Nparent chromosomes with
smaller fitness is selected to construct the new generation.
The values of Npopulation and Nparent will be determined
through experiments.
4.8 Termination Rules
Execution of GA can be terminated when the number of
generations exceeds an upper bound specified by the user.
5. Experimental Results
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algo-
rithms, these algorithms have been implemented and applied
to solve several examples that were randomly generated.
The results of these experiments are reported below. For
all experiments, the implementation was used in C, and all
experiments conducted on a personal computer (PC) with
Pentium IV 2.8 Hz CPU and 512 MB RAM. A hexagonal
system in which the cells were configured as an H-mesh was
used for simulation. Assume the antenna for each cell was
at the center of the cells, and were also assumed to be at
the center of the cells. Switches are located at the same po-
sition of cells which are randomly selected from the cells.
The cabling cost between a switch and a cell was taken to
Fig. 6 Experiments on set of examples with m =20, (a) diﬀerent values of p, (b) diﬀerent values of deg.
be proportional to the geometric distance between the two.
The communication cost between two switches is assumed
to be proportional to the geometric distance. The handoﬀ
frequency fi j for each border was generated from a normal
random number with mean 100 and variance 20.
First, the parameters of the genetic algorithm (GA)
were determined by experiments. The crossover probabil-
ity is 1.0, mutation probability is 0.3, the population size is
5 × (m + p), and the number generations of the GA is 500.
Second, several examples were used to test the eﬃ-
ciency of the proposed algorithms. The mean result obtained
by running ten times of genetic algorithm (GA) and the re-
sult obtained by performing heuristic algorithm (HA) were
examined. For the set of examples: (1) m = 20, deg = 5, p
is in {25, 30, 35, 40, 45}. The result is showed in Fig. 6(a).
For the set of examples: (2) m = 20, deg is in {5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12}, p=25. The result is showed in Fig. 6(b). For
the set of examples: (3) m = 30, deg = 10, p is in {40, 50,
60, 70, 80, 90}. The result is showed in Fig. 7(a). For the
set of examples: (4) m = 30, deg is in {5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30}, p=40. The result is showed in Fig. 7(b). For the set of
examples: (5) m = 100, deg = 10, p is in {150, 200, 250,
300, 350, 400}. The result is showed in Fig. 8(a). For the set
of examples: (6) m = 100, deg is in {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
70, 80, 90}, p=400. The result is showed in Fig. 8(b).
To know the eﬃciency of the proposed methods, the
ILP optimum finding package CPLEX was used to find the
optimal solution of each example. In the “CPLEX(CP)” col-
umn of Table 1 shows CPLEX failed to find optimum in
cases m = 30 and m = 100. The “cost” columns show the
final result of the example and the “time” columns show the
CPU time in second performed by the method on that ex-
ample. If p = |F |, then result backbone network G(S , E)
should be H(S , F). Let “LB” represent the cost obtained on
the topology H, which is the lower bound of the WABNED
problem.
Observe from the Table 1, for these cases, GA gets bet-
ter result than the HA. Moreover, GA finds the optimum
over the examples in case m = 20. Take the result of CPLEX
method as a reference, the columns “HA/CP” and “GA/CP”
in Table 1 represented the values of (other/CPLEX×100%).
Obviously, the “GA” gets the average ratio 100% to the op-

6. Conclusions
In this paper, the problem of optimum design of the two-
level wireless ATM network is investigated. Given PCN
network, handoﬀ frequencies between cells, locations of
switches on an ATM network, the number of backbone
links, the communication cost between switches, and the
degree constraint of switch, the problem is to determine the
topology of the backbone network in an optimum manner
and named as the wireless ATM backbone network design
problem (WABND).
First, the formulation of the WABND problem is given,
since the optimal communication spanning tree (OCT) prob-
lem is a special case of WABND which is NP-hard, thus the
WABND is NP-hard. Thus finding an optimal solution of
this problem in reasonable time is impractical. In this paper,
a heuristic algorithm (HA) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are
proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results showed
that genetic algorithms are robust for this problem.
In the GA method, Pru¨fer number encoding combines
an augment-edge gene is used to represent the topology
of the backbone network. In the design encoding method,
the chromosome represents a connected graph witch is a
constraint-satisfied one. Thus there is no need for penalty
function and thus the performance of genetic algorithm can
be improved. Experimental results indicate that the pro-
posed GA runs eﬃciently. The total cost of GA gets better
performance than HA algorithm.

1 Introduction
Personal Communication Network (PCN )[1, 2, 3] is an emerging wireless network that promises
many new services. Users may move from one place to another and can maintain transparent net-
work access through wireless links. Information exchanging between users, may be bidirectional,
which includes voice, data, and image.
In a PCN, the covered geographical area is typically partitioned into a set of cells . Each cell
has a base station(BS ) used for exchanging radio signals with mobile terminals. Due to the limited
power of wireless transceivers, mobile users can communicate only with base stations that reside
within the same cell. Moreover, several coverage areas of cells are grouped and formed a location
area(LA). That is, an LA consists of an aggregation of coverage areas of cells forming a contiguous
geographical region.
A typical PCN architecture based on ATM switches is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The covered
geographical area is partitioned into a set P = {P1, P2, ..., Pm} of m disjoint clusters (or LAs).
An ATM switch is allocated within each cluster and each BS in this cluster is connected to the
ATM switch. The ATM switch offers the services of establishing/releasing channels for the mobile
terminals in the cluster. Two neighboring clusters can be interconnected via the associated ATM
switches. The links between the ATM switches are called backbone links , and the links between
ATM switches and BSs are called local links [3].
When a subscriber enters a cell that belongs to a different LA, a location update (LU) or handoff
procedure that informs the network about the subscriber’s new location is performed. This will
generate network traffic overhead in PCN and consume scarce radio resources. Moreover, LU
also increases the load on distributed location databases and, thus, increases the complexity of
implementing the databases [4][5].
During the wireless environment, two types of handoffs should be considered in the designing
of the network, they are inter-switch handoff and intra-switch handoff . The intra-switch handoff
involves only one switch and the inter-switch handoff involves two switches. The inter-switch
handoffs that occur between two cells, which connected to different switches, consume much more
network resources (therefore, are much more costly) than the intra-switch handoff that occur
2
between cells, which connected to the same switch[6, 7, 8, 9]. Thus, the cost of intra-switch
handoffs involving only one switch is negligible in designing the two-level wireless ATM network.
Consider the example shown in Fig. 1, where cells A and B are connected to switch s1, and
cells C and D are connected to switch s2. If the subscriber moves from cell B to cell A, switch
s1 will perform a handoff for this call. This intra-switch handoff is relatively simple and does
not involve any location update in the databases that record the position of the subscriber. The
handoff also does not involve any network entity other than switch s1. Now imagine that the
subscriber moves from cell B to cell C. Then the inter-switch handoff involves the execution of a
fairly complicated protocol between switches s1 and s2[6, 7, 8, 9].
In this paper, the wireless ATM network design (WABND) problem is studied. Given the
PCN network, the handoff frequencies between cells, the local links between cells and switches,
the degree constraint, and the number of backbone links, the WABND problem is to find a set of
backbone links which forms a connected network such that the total cost is minimized under the
degree constraint. In [10], the WABND problem is studied and formulated, a heuristic algorithm
and a genetic algorithm have proposed to find the sub-optimal solution. Due to the complexity of
the WABND problem in a wireless ATM network, the provision of an optimal solution in reasonable
time is not guaranteed. In this respect, the usual step is to devise an approximate algorithm for
solving this problem. Simulated annealing (SA) is a stochastic computational technique derived
from statistical mechanics for finding near globally-minimum-cost solutions to large optimization
problems. Kirkpatrick et al [11] were the first to propose and demonstrate the application of
simulation techniques from statistical physics to problem of combinatorial optimization. In this
paper, two heuristic algorithms and a simulated annealing algorithm are proposed to solve it.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a formal description of the WABND
problem. Section 3 describes the proposed heuristic algorithms. In Section 4, the details of the
proposed simulated annealing algorithm are presented. Simulation results are presented in Section
5, and some concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

network is built by utilizing the available edges in graph H. Typically, some limitation is placed
on the number of links that could to be laid in the backbone network as the cost of the network
is proportional to the number of links that are to be set up in the network. The objective is to
determine the link between switches so as to minimize the handoff costs per unit time under the
degree constraint. Let deg(s) denote the degree of switch s and deg(G) denote the degree of graph
G which is the maximum degree of the switches in G. Thus deg(G) = max {deg(s)|s ∈ S }.
For example, given the graph shown in Fig. 1(b), the corresponding graph of a possible backbone
network with 10 links and deg(G) = 3 is shown in Fig. 1(c).
2.2 Problem Formulation
To formulate the location update (or handoff) cost, variables hij i, j =1, 2, ..., n takes a value of
1, if both cells ci and cj are connected to a common switch; 0, otherwise. That is, hij=1 if and
only if sid(ci) = sid(cj). With this definition, it is easy to see that the cost of handoffs per unit
time is given by
n∑
i=1
n∑
j=1
(1− hij)wij × dsid(ci),sid(cj). (1)
Given m nonempty sets of cells P={P1, P2, ..., Pm}, P is called a m–way cell partition of CG,
if P1∪P2∪ ...∪Pm=CG and Pk
⋂
Pl= ∅, where k 6= l, k, l=1, 2, ..., m. Without loss of generality,
assume the cells in set Pk are assigned to switch sk, j=1, 2, ..., m. Let LUCS(i, l) =
∑
cj∈Pl wij,
if ci not in Pl; LUCS(i, l)=0, otherwise. Then for a given m-way cell partition P , the location
update cost of the partition can be represented as
∑
ci∈CG
∑
sl∈S
LUCS(i, l)× dsid(ci),l. (2)
Because the assignments of cells to switches are fixed and known, the location update cost
between switches is also fixed. Let LUSS(k, l) =
∑
ci∈Pk LUCS(i, l), if k 6= l; LUSS(k, l) =0,
otherwise. Then the location update cost can be represented as
m∑
k=1
m∑
l=1
LUSS(k, l)× dkl. (3)
In this paper, the designing problem of allocating the backbone links among the ATM switches
with the objective that minimizes the cost of location update under the degree constraint is studied.

xij ≤ Fij,∀i, j = 1, 2, ...,m; (11)
xij ∈ {0, 1},∀i, j = 1, 2, ...,m; (12)
The backbone network must be a connected graph, the reachability from one switch to any
switch is ensured this way. The graph G is partitioned into two connected parts, X and Y .
Obviously there must be at least an edge going from X to Y for each feasible solution. Otherwise,
the switches in Y cannot be reached. The reachability of graph G is stated as
∑
i∈X,j∈Y
xij ≥ 1,∀ partition X and Y of G. (13)
There are 2m ways to partition a graph, so the number of constraints is in the order of 2m.
Constraint (13) is satisfied by all feasible solutions, and vice versa, any solution in which there
exist unreachable switch must violate at least one of them.
2.4 Related Works
Given the PCN, handoff frequencies of cells in PCN, the connected ATM backbone network, and
the capacities of switches, Merchant and Sengupta[6] formulated the cell assignment problem and
considered the problem of assigning cells to switches (determined local links) in wireless ATM
network and several extended studies has been explored[7, 8, 9].
Huang and Wang[3] investigated the design problem of allocating the backbone links among the
ATM switches with the objective of reducing the effect of terminal mobility on the performance of
wireless PCN’s. The problem, which is called the Link Allocation Problem (LAP) on ATM-based
PCN, is known NP-complete [3]. Formally, given a graph H(S, F, z = 1) and positive integers deg
and p, deg ≤ |S| and |S| − 1 ≤ p ≤ |F |, the LAP is to find a connected subgraph G = (S,E) of

3 Heuristic Algorithm for WABND
In this section, two heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the WABND problem, they are
remove-based heuristic (RBH) and weight-median-based heuristic (WMBH) algorithms.
3.1 Remove-based Heuristic(RBH)
Given network H(S, F ), since p ≤ |F |, |F |−p edges should be removed from H(S, F ) to construct
the backbone network G(S,E). Define bridge edge be an edge whose remove disconnected H(S, F ).
After removing edges from H(S, F ), the graph G(S,E) should be a connected and constraint-
satisfied (degree-constraint and edge-constraint) graph. Obviously, bridge edges in H(S, F ) can
not be removed. Moreover, if the connected components of graph H(S, F ) are given, bridge edge
be the edge which connects different components. Obviously, the connected-component finding
algorithm (in O(|F |+ |V |) time) and a sequential testing procedure (in O(|F |) time) can be used
to find the set BEH of bridge edges in H(S, F ). Let CCH = {CC1, CC2, ..., CCq} be the set of
the connected components of the H(S, F ).
Let degreeH(sk) be the degree of switch sk in H(S, F ). For each switch sk, define CONH(sk)=1,
if degreeH(sk) > deg; CONH(sk)=0, otherwise. For each edge e = (sk, sl) in CCH , define
CONH(e) = CONH(sk) + CONH(sl). Moreover, edges in F − BEH are partitioned into three
groups FREEH , CON1H , CON2H according to the CONH value of edges. That is, FREEH ,
CON1H , and CON2H be the set of edges in CCH , whose CONH value is equal to 0, 1, and 2,
respectively.
Initially, let H
′
(S, F
′
) be the same as H(S, F ). A non-bridge edge e = (sk, sl) is found in
(CON2H′ , CON1H′ or FREEH′ ) which minimize ∆ = opt(H
′
− e) − opt(H
′
−),∀e ∈ CON2H′ .
That is, if CON2H′ is nonempty, find an edge e = (sk, sl) in CON2H′ ; otherwise if CON1H′ is
nonempty find an edge e = (sk, sl) in CON1H′ ; otherwise find an edge e = (sk, sl) in FREEH′ .
Then, remove e from H
′
. Since edge e should be in CCi ⊆ CCH′ for some i, remove e from
H
′
may make the CCi change. The component CCi may be divided into serval smaller connected
components and some new bridge edges may be generated. These may change BEH′ and CCH′ ;
moreover, the sets FREEH′ , CON1H′ and CON2H′ should be updated. The edge-removing

Find the node sx which minimizes sumx.
Then, the famous Dijkstra’s algorithm is modified to find shortest-path based degree-constrained
spanning tree. The details of algorithm is shown as follows:
Degree-constrained-tree (source s)
V ={s}, N = S − V , T = ∅ ;
while (S − V 6= ∅) begin
for all links (u, v), u ∈ V and v ∈ S − V begin
find the link (k, l) such that deg(T ∪ (k, l)) ≤ deg and with smallest cost zkl ≤ min∀u∈V,v∈S−V {zuv}
if (found)
then { T = T ∪ (k, l); V = V ∪ {l}; N = S − V ;}
else return notfound;
end
end
return T ;
Final, The shortest-path based degree-constrained spanning trees Tx of H(S, F, z) with 1-
weight-median sx as root is found by performing the degree-constrained algorithm[10](as shown
above). Define opt(T ) be the object cost of the spanning tree T , that is, opt(T ) =

dkl, where dkl be the shortest distance between switches sk and sl in T . Let Tx = (S,E1). Finally, a
set of p−|Tx| edges are added in phase two to form the graph G; where |Tx| is the number of edges
in Tx and p is the total number of edges to be included in G. The order of edges to be added to G,

4 Simulated Annealing Algorithm for WABND
Simulated annealing is a stochastic computational technique derived from statistical mechanics
for finding near globally-minimum-cost solutions to large optimization problems. Kirkpatrick et
al [11] were the first to propose and demonstrate the application of simulation techniques from
statistical physics to problem of combinatorial optimization.
Due to the complexity of the WABND problem, the provision of an optimal solution in reason-
able time is not guaranteed. In this respect, the usual step is to devise an approximate algorithm
for solving this problem. The simulated annealing (SA) technique is applied to solve the WABND
problem in this section.
In this section, the details of simulated annealing algorithm developed to solve the WABND
problem is present. The key elements in a simulated annealing algorithm are: (1) a configuration
space, (2) a cost function, (3) a perturbation mechanism, and (4) a cooling schedule. The solution
methods are shown in following subsections.
4.1 Configuration Space
The objective of WABND problem is to find an optimal topology so that the object function value
is minimized under the connected and degree-constraint. To do this, the configuration space is
designed to be the set of possible solutions. Each configuration is defined as a topology network
which is represented by adjacency matrix .
4.2 Initial Configuration Generation
The initial configuration of the simulated annealing algorithm is generated by performing one of
the heuristic algorithms described in Section 3.
4.3 Cost Function
Generally, simulated annealing algorithms use costs function to achieve the goal of finding op-
timally assignments. The goal is to minimize the total cost of the wireless ATM network. For
the given network topology, the all-pair shortest path algorithm is used to find the distance dkl
14
edges in F − E, whose CONG value is equal to 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
If edge e in N CON2G is selected and added into G(S,E). Then after removing an arbitrary
edge other than e, the resulted configuration will not be a constraint-satisfied one. Thus, only
those edges in N FREEG or N CON1G can be selected and added to G(S,E). Let G
′
(S,E
′
) =
G(S,E) ∪ e.
To remove an edges from G
′
(S,E
′
), the resulted graph should be connected and constraint-
satisfied. Thus bridge edges in G
′
(S,E
′
) can not be removed. Let BEG′ be the set of bridge
edges in G
′
(S,E
′
). Edges in G
′
− BEG′ are partitioned into two groups FREEG′ and CON1G′
according to the CONG′ value of edges. That is, FREEG′ and CON1G′ be the set of edges in
G
′
(S,E
′
), whose CONG′ value is equal to 0 and 1, respectively.
Eight types of perturbations are introduced into the simulated annealing algorithm and shown
as follows. The following perturbation schemes are: first added an edge into G(S,E), then deleted
an edge to construct the new configuration.
• P1: random add random delete (RARD): Randomly select an edge ein in N FREEG ∪
N CON1G and add to G(S,E). If ein ∈ N FREEG then random select an edge eout in
FREEG′ and delete. If ein ∈ N CON1G and sk be the switch with degree(sk)G′ > deg then
random select an edge eout, one of the endpoint of eout is sk and eout in CON1G′ . Delete the
edge eout form G
′
(S,E
′
) to generate the new configuration.
• P2: random add best delete (RABD): Randomly select an edge ein in N FREEG∪N CON1G
and add to G(S,E). If ein ∈ N FREEG then find the edge eout which minimizes opt(G
′
(S,E
′
)−
eout) − opt(G
′
(S,E
′
)); if tie, random select one of them. If ein ∈ N CON1G and sk be
the switch with degreeG′ (sk) > deg then find the edge eout in CON1G′ which minimizes
opt(G
′
(S,E
′
) − eout) − opt(G
′
(S,E
′
)). Delete the edge eout form G
′
(S,E
′
) to generate the
new configuration.
• P3: best add random delete (BARD): Select an edge ein in N FREEG ∪N CON1G which
maximizes opt(G(S,E)) − opt(G(S,E) ∪ ein); if tie, random select one of them and add
to G(S,E). If ein ∈ N FREEG then random select an edge eout in FREEG′ . If ein ∈
16
• P7: best delete random add (BDRA): Select an edge eout in E − BEG which minimizes
opt(G(S,E) − eout) − opt(G(S,E)); if tie, random select one of them and delete. Random
select an edge ein in FREEG′′ and add.
• P8: best delete best add (BDBA): Select an edge eout in E−BEG which minimizes opt(G(S,E)−
eout) − opt(G(S,E)); if tie, random select one of them and delete. Find the edge ein in
FREEG′′ which minimizes opt(G
′′
(S,E
′
)) - opt(G
′′
(S,E
′
)∪ ein); if tie, random select one of
them and add.
Let pi be the probability of transforming current configuration to a new one by applying the
perturbation Pi, i=1,2,...,8, respectively. Assume that Σ8i=1pi = 1. Let AP0 = 0 and APi = Σ
i
j=1pj
be the accumulated probability of pi, i=1, 2, ..., 8.
4.5 Cooling Schedule
One of the most important problems involved in the simulated annealing algorithm implementa-
tion is the definition of a proper cooling schedule, which is based on the choice of the following
parameters: starting temperature, final temperature, length of Markov chains , the way of decreas-
ing temperature. A correct choice of these parameters is crucial because the performances of the
algorithm strongly depend on it. These parameters are described as follows.
(1) Initial value of the control parameter : The rule used in SA that the starting temperature
c0 is determined by calculating the average increasing in cost, ∆C
+
, for 50 random transitions
and solve c0 from c0 = ∆C
+
/ln(χ−10 ), where accepted ratio χ0 defined as the number of accepted
transitions divided by the number of proposed transitions. In this paper, the accepted ratio χ0 is
empirically set to 0.55.
(2) Decrement of the control parameter : The decreasing rate of the temperature needs to be
small enough to reach thermal equilibrium for each temperature value. As the temperature is
decreased, the accepted ratio is lowered. When no solution that increases the objective function
can be found, the system is ‘frozen’ and converged to a certain solution. The speed of coverage
of the simulated annealing algorithm depended on the decreasing rate of the temperature and the
length of the Markov chain. As mentioned in [27], the decrement is chosen such that small Markov

5 Experimental Results
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, these algorithms have been
implemented and applied to solve several randomly generated examples. The results of these
experiments are reported below. All the algorithms were implemented by C, and all experiments
conducted on a personal computer (PC) with Pentium IV 2.8 HZ CPU and 512MB RAM. A
hexagonal system in which the cells were configured as an H-mesh was used for simulation. Assume
the antenna for each cell was at the center of the cells, and were also assumed to be at the center
of the cells. Switches are located at the same position of cells which are randomly selected from
the cells. The cabling cost between a switch and a cell was taken to be proportional to the
geometric distance between the two. The communication cost between two switches is assumed
to be proportional to the geometric distance. The handoff frequency fij for each border was
generated from a normal random number with mean 100 and variance 20.
Several examples were used to test the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. The mean result
obtained by running ten times of simulated annealing algorithm(SA), genetic algorithm (GA)[10],
and the result obtained by performing the heuristic algorithms RBH, WMBH, and HA (proposed
in [10]) were examined. The parameters of the GA[10] were: crossover probability is 1.0, mutation
probability is 0.3, the population size is 5 × (m + p), and the number generations of the GA is
500.
For the set of examples: m = 20, deg = 5, p is in {25, 30, 35, 40, 45}, the result is showed
in Fig. 2(a). For the set of examples: m = 20, deg is in {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, p=25, the
result is showed in Fig. 2(b). For the set of examples: m = 30, deg = 10, p is in {40, 50, 60, 70,
80, 90}, the result is showed in Fig. 3(a). For the set of examples: m = 30, deg is in {5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30}, p=40, the result is showed in Fig. 3(b). The proposed simulated annealing algorithm
can get the best result as the same obtained by the genetic algorithm (GA) as indicated from the
experimental results. Moreover, the proposed heuristic algorithms RBH and WMBH get better
results than HA.
