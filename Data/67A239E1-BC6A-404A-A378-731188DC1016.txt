Abstract - This project proposes a design 
method of ∞H  control performance for 
structural systems using the Tagagi-Sugeno 
(T-S) fuzzy model. The structural system with 
tuned mass damper is modeled by T-S type 
fuzzy model. Through using the parallel 
distributed compensation (PDC) scheme, we 
design a nonlinear fuzzy controller for the 
tuned mass damper system. According to the 
control system, a sufficient stability condition 
is derived in terms of Lyapunov theory and this 
control problem is reformulated into solving 
the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) problem. 
Furthermore, the tuned mass damper is 
designed according to the first mode of 
frequency of the control system and then the 
fuzzy controller is found via Matlab LMI 
toolbox to stabilize the structural system. A 
simulation example is given to show the 
feasibility of the proposed fuzzy controller 
design method.  
Keywords: ∞H control, linear matrix 
inequality. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
In civil engineering, the disturbances such 
as earthquake excitations, wind loadings, and 
system parameters etc. are always unknown. 
However, in the seismic design field of 
structure systems, researchers always considers 
the past representative earthquake records as an 
input of controlled systems to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed control methods 
(for example, see [1-6] and the references 
therein). These representative disturbances 
included El Centro, Tabas, and Taft earthquake 
etc. The peak ground acceleration recorded by 
wave profiles almost exceeds the design 
standard that structures can bear. Some of the 
above papers placed emphasis on a predictive 
active control for structural systems. Most of 
them proposed and demonstrated the 
effectiveness of their controller design for 
reducing the response of structures with the 
representative disturbances. According to the 
previous reports, if the proposed controller can 
readily reduce the structure response subjected 
to strong earthquake via the demonstration with 
numerical simulations, the control methods 
were regarded quite robust and remarkable. 
Fuzzy control recently has increasingly 
attracted attention because it has been applied 
successfully to various nonlinear applications. 
Among them, the famous T-S fuzzy model was

By using the fuzzy inference method with a 
singleton fuzzifier, product inference, and 
center average defuzzifier, the dynamic fuzzy

where ft  denotes the terminal time of the 
control, P  are some positive definite matrices, 
η  is a prescribed value which denotes the 
effect of )(tφ  on )(tX , and Q  is a positive 
definite weighting matrix. 
A stability condition is derived below to 
guarantee the stability and control performance 
of the closed-loop control system (9). 
Theorem 1: The equilibrium point of fuzzy 
control system (9) is stable in the large if there 
exist a common positive definite matrix P such 
that the following inequality is satisfied:

III. A SIMULATION EXAMPLE 
    
 The applications of the model-based fuzzy 
control methods presented in this paper are 
illustrated in this section. The complete design 
procedure of the real structural system is 
described below. First, the four-story building of 
real structural system is considered. The mass, 
stiffness of each floor mass is 345600kg, 
3.1*108 nt/m, and damping ratio is 0.02. 
According to the above system parameters, we 
assume mass and stiffness of TMD are 
20736=dm  kg, 2240000=dk  N/m, and we will 
have damping ratio of TMD = 0.02, the nature 
frequency of the 4-story building,

The E-W component of the Taiwan Chi Chi 
earthquake record in 1999 scaled to a maximum 
ground acceleration of 1g is used as input 
excitation shown in Fig. 2, and its duration is 35 
seconds.  
The structural systems are represented by the 
above proposed fuzzy model    
In order to guarantee the H infinity control 
performance, the optimal values η  and Q  
should be suitably selected in Theorem 1.  
Therefore, based on Theorem 1, the 
structural system with the TMD equipped under 
a disturbance is guaranteed to be stabilized by 
the proposed T-S fuzzy controllers. The 
displacement time histories of the 1th, 2th, 3th, 
and 4th floor with and without model-based 
control are presented in Figs. 3-6.  
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
    The objective of this paper is to develop an 
efficient fuzzy control algorithm on stability 
problems of the structural systems presented by 
T-S type fuzzy model. The effectiveness and the 
feasibility of the proposed controller design 
method is demonstrated through numerical 
simulations on the four-story shear building 
under a seismic excitation, Taiwan Chi Chi 
earthquake occurred in 1999.
