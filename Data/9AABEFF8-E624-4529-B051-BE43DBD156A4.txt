ABSTRACT
This study is aimed to treat in great detail the problem of convective heat transfer introduced
by combined electrokinetic and pressure forces in micro- and nano-channels. Analytical solutions
are presented for a slit microchannel and a microtube with constant surface heat flux, taking into
account the effect of Joule heating within the fluid. Representative results for the velocity and
temperature distributions, the friction factor, as well as the Nusselt number are presented over a
wide range of operating conditions. The present problem is governed by two scale ratios and the
dimensionless source term. The two important ratios are the length scale ratio (the ratio of
Debye lengthD to half channel height or tube radius H, i.e.D/H) and the velocity scale ratio
(the ratio of the pressure-driven velocity scale for Poiseuille flow to Helmholtz-Smoluchowski
velocity for electroosmotic flow i.e. HSPD uu ).
For mixed electro-osmotic and pressure-driven flow, the resulting velocity profile is the
superimposed effect of both electro-osmotic and Poiseuille flow phenomena. The velocity
profiles in parallel-plate microchannel exhibit similar trends to those in a circular microtube, i.e.
the velocity profile decrease as the length scale ratio increases. The normalized temperature
profiles across the channel increases monotonously form the channel core to the wall. The
maximum dimensionless temperature is observed at the wall and the wall temperature increases
with increasing Joule heating parameter G. Also, the temperature is increased with increasing the
value offor given values ofand G. The fully developed Nusselt number takes the maximum
value at this limiting case of 0 , and then decreases with increasing. Moreover, the Nusselt
number decreases with and then goes asymptotically to the limit of Poiseuille flow as  ,
where the flow is dominated by the pressure force.

pressure and electroosmotically driven flow. An analysis for fully-developed thermal transport
was carried out by Maynes and Webb [14] for electroosmotically driven flow in a microchannel.
They presented analytical results for the for fully-developed Nusselt number. They also
investigated the effect of viscous dissipation effect on the heat transfer of purely electroosmotic
flow in microchannels [15] and reported that viscous dissipation effect is only important at low
values of the relative duct radius, and thus concluded that the influence of viscous dissipation is
negligible for most practical electro-osmotic flow applications. Very recently, Das and
Chakraborty [16] have presented analytical solutions for the transport characteristics of a
non-Newtonian power-law fluid through a parallel plate microchannel. As an illustrative case
study, they analyzed the flow behavior of a blood sample. In the present proposal, we attempt to
deal with the problem of convective heat transfer for mixed electroosmotic and pressure-driven
flow in a parallel plate microchannel and in a microtube. The governing system of equations
consists of the electric potential field, flow field, and energy equations. Well-known solutions to
the Poisson-Boltzmann equation give the electrical potential distribution, the net electric charge
density, and subsequently the body force due to an externally applied field. Similarly the
solutions to the momentum equation with an electrokinetic body force yield the velocity
distribution of the fluid flow. Finally the associated thermal transport problem is solved to obtain
the temperature distribution and thus the Nusselt number. As will be seen in the next section, the
present problem is governed by two scale ratios and the dimensionless source term. The two
important ratios are the length scale ratio(i.e., the ratio of Debye lengthD to half channel height
H, or D/H) and the velocity scale ratio (i.e., the ratio of the pressure-driven velocity scale
for Poiseuille flow to Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity for electroosmotic flow, or
 HSPD uu . It is noted from the definition of the length scale ratio that the case of << 1
corresponds to a microchannel, while it may be the case for a nano-channel when is finite.
Nano-channel arrays have potential applications in bio-molecular separators, drug delivery devices,
and bio-encapsulation. Natural nano-channels exist in cells for the purpose of providing nutrients
and discarding waste. It is noted that the velocity scale ratio can take on positive or negative
values, depending on the signs of the streamwise potential and pressure gradients imposed.
Representative results for the velocity and temperature profiles, the flow rate, the friction factor, as
well as the Nusselt number will be presented and discussed for a range of the governing
dimensionless parameters.
Problem Formulation
Consider a steady, incompressible flow in a micro-duct (slit microchannel or circular
microcapillary) where the flow is driven by mixed electroosmotic and pressure forces with
coordinates as shown in Fig. 1. When the solid surface is in contact with an aqueous (polar)
solution, the surface usually attains a relative electric charge, which influences the charge
distribution in the solution. For instance, glass and fused silica capillaries carry dissociable
silanol groups on the surface, and are therefore negatively charged when adjacent to polar liquids.
Due to electrostatic interactions, both co-ions and counter-ions are preferentially redistributed near
the charged surface, leading to the formation of an electrical double layer (EDL).

Flow field and scaling
It is known that microchannel electroosmotic flow is generally very slow in nature with very
low Reynolds number, and thus the inertial term is negligible compared to viscous term. Thus,
we can assume that the flow is hydrodynamically developed flow and the momentum equation is
given by

Results and Discussion
The dimensionless velocity profiles represented by equations (9) and (10) reveal that the
momentum transport is dominated by electrokinetic effect as 0 , and thus the velocity profile
is dependent solely on the length scale ratio. For= 0 and 0 , the velocity profile reduces
to the classical Helmoltz-Smoluchowski velocity, i.e. 1HSuu . It is also noted that the
momentum transport is governed by the pressure forcesas  (for any value of ), and a
parabolic velocity profile of the classical Poiseuille flow can be retrieved from equations (9) and
(10) by rescaling the velocity based on the pressure-driven velocity scale. The velocity profiles
for purely electro-osmotic flow (= 0) can be found in the open literature, and hence they are not
presented here for the sake of brevity. It can be summarized that the slug-like velocity
distribution is justified across the channel with a very thin boundary layer near the wall when
1 (microchannel). On the other hand, at finie (nanochannel), say 1O~ , the velocity
distribution approximates the parabolic profile of classical pressure-driven channel flow. At
intermediate values of, where the electrokinetic effect on momentum transport varies from a
