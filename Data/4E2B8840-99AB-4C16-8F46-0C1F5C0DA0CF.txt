Abstract
Large Scale Production of Silica Nano/Micro- Hollow Spheres by
Bacterial Templates
Nano- or micro- particles are a small-size material receiving wide attention. Normally the particles
are solid rather than hollow. The spheres could be either inorganic such as silica, or organic such as
polystyrene. Latest approaches in the laboratory to making nano-hollow spheres mainly utilize
a“template”, namely making nano-“core-shel” particles first and then removing the core to get the 
hollow shell. However, this method is not ready yet for commercialization. This project follows the
research in the previous two years, from making small amounts of hollow spheres to producing a
large quantity of nano/micro- spheres using bacteria or bacteriophages as templates. In the first year,
the project inspector proposed a novel way of making inorganic nano-hollow spheres by
polymerizing, in sol-gel method, the glass monomer-rich shell formed in bubbled surfactant
micelles. The process was proved to be useful except that it needs improvements for mass
production. In the second year, bubbling micelles was combined with monomer polymerization of
organic polymers, which showed that the bubbled micelle polymerization was applicable to both
organic and inorganic materials. However, to expedite the manufacture of hollow spheres, the
project inspector considers, in the third year, to adopt the template method to achieve large scale
production. In order to match the synthetic conditions such as high concentration and good
dispersion in the liquid phase, micro-scale bacteria and nano-scale phages are chosen as low cost
templates. Moreover, with the various shapes of the microbes such as sphere or rods, hollow

Introduction
Electrically conducting polymers bring a new era of novel devices and applications emerging gradually in the
market. Decades of revolutionary research has not only discovered exciting science but also led to plastic
electronics. Due to its high electrical conductivities, poly(3-hexylthiophene) or P3HT behaves like
semiconductors. It is normally used as the hole transport layer (HTL) in an electroluminescent device, and the
conductive components in coatings and plastic composites [1,2]. P3HT was reported spun cast on a substrate at
8 g P3HT/l chloroform, to form a film 35 nm thick. P3HT films have a wider light absorption band and a more
orderly packing in polymer chains, which results in better charge transport properties [3]. In application, thinner
P3HT layers are expected to give a higher electrical conductance in the direction of the basal plane so as to
increase the on/off current ratio in P3HT-based organic thin film transistors (OTFT).
Experiments performed in the study are to measure the electrical currents of P3HT thin films deposited on
insulating mica, by spin-coating from P3HT droplets with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. To study the effects
of droplet concentration on the film quality, morphological imaging using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
conductance measurements by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter were performed.
Experimental
Materials
P3HT (Fig. 1) were synthesized in our lab with THF (95%, Aldrich) as solvent; mica plates as substrate and
cleaned with DI water before use.
Figure 1. Chemical structure of P3HT
Equipment
The P3HT thin films were formed on mica by a spin coater (Pentad Scientific, PM490). Film morphologies
were obtained using AC mode or semi-contact AFM (Angscope SPM-A-100) from AngsNanoTek, Taiwan. I-V
data were obtained by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter (Model 6430) from Keithley. The probe has a tip diameter
of 5.0μm (Koo-17618) and is from American Probe and Technologies. The distance between the two probes is
5.0 mm. The bias potential scanned was from -20 V to +20 V.
Method
A scheme of the film deposition process is shown in Fig. 2. P3HT was dissolved in THF at various
concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 mg/l). Next 5μl of the P3HT solution was loaded
onto freshly cleaved and cleaned mica surface by spin-coating at successive 1500 and 2000 rpm at room
temperature. After dried in ambient air, the sample was rinsed by DI water and then sent for analyses.

Introduction
Poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ehtyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene), MEH-PPV, is one important kind of
optoelectronic polymer. It could be applied to polymer light emitting diode (PLED) in flat panel displays (FPD).
MEH-PPV has the advantages of low driving voltage and high luminescent efficiency, and could exist in
polymer form which dissolves in general organic solvent. The experiments we performed are to deposit
MEH-PPV thin films on insulating mica by spin-coating, from MEH-PPV droplets with toluene as solvent. In
order to study the effects of droplet concentration on the film quality, morphology imaging using atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and conductance measurements by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter were performed. The
current-voltage (I-V) curves were obtained at several different concentrations, showing that a higher
conductance is attained for MEH-PPV thin films as the concentration increases. Meanwhile, AFM images also
showed a more compact film morphology with nano-metric thickness.
PLED was firstly reported in 1982 by Patridge et al., using spin-coated poly(vinylcarbazole) or PVK to emit
light [1]. Later in 1990, the Cavendish Lab of the University of Cambridge developed the ITO/PPV/Al PLED
which emits yellowish-green light [2,3]. Soon in 1991, Heeger et al. developed soluble PPV with grafted side
chains, i.e., MEH-PPV [4]. MEH-PPV has a bandgap of 2.1 eV and emits orange-red light at 610 nm. A lot of
work has been done to enhance the life and efficiency of PLED. However, for commercialization the film
morphology after being spun on the substrate still needs deeper investigation.
Experimental
Materials
MEH-PPV (Fig. 1) were synthesized in our lab with toluene (C7H8, HPLC grade, TEDIA) as solvent; mica
plates as substrate and cleaned with DI water before use.
Figure 1. Chemical structure of MEH-PPV
Equipment
The MEH-PPV thin films were formed on mica by a spin coater (Pentad Scientific, PM490). Film
morphologies were obtained using AC mode or semi-contact AFM (Angscope SPM-A-100) from AngsNanoTek,
Taiwan. I-V data were obtained by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter (Model 6430) from Keithley. The probe has a
tip diameter of 5.0 μm (Koo-17618) and is from American Probe and Technologies. The distance between the
two probes is 5.0 mm. The bias potential scanned was from -20 V to +20 V. In this study, the two-line probe
method was used to calculate the conductance from the I-V curves. Two lines of silver glue were drawn
carefully with 5.0 mm spacing or else on the MEH-PPV surface before engaging the metal probes onto them,
separately.
Method
A scheme of the film deposition process is shown in Fig. 2. MEH-PPV was dissolved in toluene at various
concentrations (0.375, 0.750, 0.938, 1.12, 1.31, 1.50, and 3.00 g/l). Next 250 µl of the MEH-PPV solution was
loaded onto freshly cleaved and ethanol/water cleaned mica surface by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s under
ambient conditions. After dried in air, the sample was rinsed by DI water and then sent for analyses.

Introduction
The indium tin oxide film deposited on PET plastic substrate (ITO-PET), has several advantages such as low
cost, good mechanical durability, low surface resistance, and high absorbency to ultraviolet radiation. It is
widely used in making touch screen panels, flat panel displays, and smart windows. In a light-emitting diode
(LED), the photo-active, semi-conducting polymer could be sandwiched in between a transparent hole-injecting
ITO electrode and a low work function, electron-injecting metal contact such as aluminum, magnesium or
calcium. Given a proper bias, electrons and holes are injected and will meet within polymer. As a result,
emission of light occurs due to the irradiative charge carrier recombination inside the polymer film [1]. In most
cases, patterned ITO is needed for making pixels [2]. As the ITO film gets thinner, it becomes more difficult to
measure the conductance and conductivity due to the very low currents passing through. The work reports the
etching of flexible ITO-PET substrates using hydrochloric acid (HCl) for different periods of time. In order to
understand the etching effects on the film, morphological studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
conductance measurements by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter were performed.
Experimental
Materials
HCl (95%, Aldrich) was diluted to 10% as the etching solvent. ITO-PET plates (Sheldah) were cleaned with
deionized (DI) water before use and cut into pieces of 2 × 3 cm2. Adhesive tape was used to mask parts of the
ITO surface.
Equipment
The ITO thin film morphologies were obtained using AC mode or semi-contact AFM (Angscope SPM-A-100)
from AngsNanoTek, Taiwan. I-V data were obtained by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter (Model 6430) from
Keithley. The probe has a tip diameter of 5.0 μm (Koo-17618) and is from American Probe and Technologies.
The distance between the two probes is 5.0 mm. The bias potential scanned was from -20 V to +20 V.
Two-point probe method was used to calculate the conductance from the I-V curves.
Method
A scheme of the film etching process is shown in Fig. 1. ITO-PET plates were masked firstly in parts by
adhesive tapes. The masked parts will be protected from etching. Next the masked samples were immerged in a
10% HCl solution for different periods of etching times (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 s). The concentration of
HCl will affect the etching speed a lot. After etching the samples were quickly put to rinse in DI water for 1 min.
Finally, the samples were dried in ambient air and then sent for analyses.
Figure 1. Scheme for etching ITO stripes on an ITO-PET substrate using HCl.
Results and discussion
The I-V curves were obtained by a sub-femto-amp SourceMeter and the two-point probe method was used to
calculate the conductance. The probe tip diameter is 5.0 μmand the probe distance is 5.0 mm. Fig. 2 gives a
curve of ITO film conductance against the HCl etching time. Note that the PET layer supporting the ITO layer is
Measurement of Surfactant Critical Micelle Concentration Using UV-VIS Spectroscopy

Introduction
When small amounts are added into water, the surfactant will dissolve and disperse as individual
molecules. As the added surfactant reaches a certain value (i.e., CMC), about 50 ~ 200 (or more)
surfactant molecules will form aggregates of either spheres, cylinders, or lamellar forms, mainly
owing to concentration and different size ratios of the hydrophilic head group to the hydrophobic tail
group of the surfactant [1]. For most unitary component surfactant solutions, spherical micelles occur
near the CMC point [2]. When the concentration goes up to about ten times CMC or more, the
surfactant would be regarded as an emulsifier in oil-water mixtures [3]. Micelles in this condition
become more asymmetric in shape [4].
The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of a surfactant is a very important parameter in making
and designing materials with micro- and nano-scale structures. Methods for measuring the CMC
include electroconductivity, surface tension, light scattering, HPLC (high performance liquid
chromatography), etc. Among the above methods, “precision”or “reproducibility”is the key to
success. In current study, the UV-VIS method, without the help of additives such as pyrene, was taken
to measure the CMC of the SDS system (aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate) and compared to the
common electroconductivity approach. Statistical analyses were applied to the UV-VIS spectroscopic
results to examine the confidence level. Reproducibility was also checked by extrapolation of the
regressions. UV-VIS spectroscopy proves in this work an efficient tool to measure CMC, especially in
the deep ultraviolet region from 190 ~ 300 nm. The technique is expected to help understand the
nano-structural changes of surfactant micelles.
Experimental
Preparation of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution
SDS (from Merk, Fig. 1) of various amounts is mixed with deionized water to give aqueous
solutions 100 ml each. Next samples were put to ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. After that the samples
were held still for 10 minutes to stabilize and form nanostructures. The prepared samples were then
sent to UV-VIS spectroscopy.

Formation of Silica Hollow Capsules on Biotemplates

Introduction
Using yeast as template to produce ink capsules has been commercialized. However, making smaller
sized capsules via biotemplate is still a challenge and under vigorous investigation. Although coiled
proteins have also been used as template to make nano-scale hollow spheres, it is not easy to obtain
special shapes [1].
Template-based synthesis is a common approach to form orderly nanostructures or patterns. It is a
stimulus or promoter for self-assembling. Template could be either hard (like solid spheres) or soft (e.g.,
droplets and bubbles). Among them the solid template, especially the polymer nanoparticles, is the most
popular. Polystyrene (PS) spheres could be made at various diameters for the deposition of silica
nanoparticles or sols from the alkoxide sol-gel precursors. Upon sintering, the adsorbed nanoparticles
would melt, link, and form a shell of silica. The PS template is normally removed by heat or solvent. The
shell is distinguishable under TEM from its solid or empty core. For example, R. A. Caruso et al. prepared
hollow SiO2 spheres using PS as template [2]. A. Imhof also used PS as template to make TiO2 hollow
spheres [3]. Kai Zhang et al. used PMMA as template to make SiO2 –PMMA core-shell particles with
TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate or tetraethoxysilane) as the shell precursor [5]. Non-polymeric materials
such as gold nanoparticles were used as template by A. Ostafin et al. to make mesoporous SiO2 hollow
spheres [5].
In this report, we prepared silica hollow capsules using rod-like clostridium and its spherical spores as
template. The silica shells were formed via the sol-gel method while the 1 µm clostridium spores were
formed by putting the 3 µm long clostridium in a basic solution. The core-shell particles of spores coated
with silica nanoparticles were observed under TEM, indicating the possibility to use even smaller
biotemplates of various forms to produce hollow capsules for novel applications.
Experimental
Materials
Clostridium bacteria were given by courtesy of Dr. Shu-Yii Wu, director ofthe bio-hydrogen laboratory
of Feng Chia University. Ammonia (NH3, 28%, SHOWA) was used as received. Tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS, 98%, ACROS) and ethanol (95%, SHOWA) were both used without further purification.
Equipment
High-speed centrifuge (Mikro 22) is from Hettich, German, and was used to separate the bacteria from
the suspension to be rinsed away. Whittmann heating magnetic-agitator is from Heraeus, German, and
was used to disperse the bacteria and chemicals. Transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL II
1200EX) is from Jeol, Japan, and was used to image the bacteria and silica capsules. Variable vacuum
scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM & EDX, S3000) is from Hitachi,
Japan, and was used to image the bacteria and silica capsules.
Preparation of biotemplates
The given bacteria were firstly separated as precipitate from the medium by putting 30 ml solution in
the centrifuge for a while. Secondly the bacterial precipitate was added by water and sent to
centrifugation for 2 times. To induce the formation of Clostridium spores, a 30 ml bacterial solution was
added by 5 ml of NH3 and left still for 3 d at pH = 10. The other approach is to add drops of concentrated
HCl to the 30 ml bacterial solution and leave intact for 3 d at pH = 1. At the same time, 1 ml TEOS and 1
ml ethanol were mixed together for 1 h. To deposit silica onto the spores by the sol-gel reactions, 3 ml of
ammonia bacterial solution was added dropwise into the 2 ml TEOS ethanol mixture with vigorous
stirring. After 1 h, the sample was washed for 2 times by centrifugation and sent to microscopy.
