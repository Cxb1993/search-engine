equations and the idea of mechanism inversion to find
the instant centres, centrodes, inflection circles, and
centres of curvature of planar linkages.Yan and Hsu [7]
have also utilized the velocity matrix to determine
the location of unknown instant centres of com-
plex mechanisms. These methods do not rely on the
Aronhold–Kennedy theorem, and they are applicable
to any planar mechanism including the indeterminate
ones, but they require the evaluation of the derivatives
of the vector loop closure equations of the mecha-
nism to obtain the relative instant centre of each pair
of the movable links. Therefore, it would be elaborate
if the mechanism contains several coupled kinematic
loops, or only the locations of certain set of instant
centres are required to be evaluated.
Based on the fact that the location of the instant
centres of a single-DOF planar linkage is independent
of the selection of the input joint and its velocity, a
new analytical method is developed for locating the
instant centres of indeterminate linkages, which does
not rely on velocity information or graphical tech-
niques. The proposed method consists of two parts.
In the first part, the SICs of a given linkage are initially
classified into three classes according to the level of
their geometric dependencies. Based on this classifi-
cation and the use of the circle diagram, a directed
graph referred to as the instant-centre digraph is
introduced to discriminate the recursive relationships
between the SICs. The breadth-first search algorithm
is then applied to the graph for finding the occur-
rence sequences, referred to as the instant-centrewalk,
of these instant-centres. In addition, a recursive for-
mula is established for successively computing the
coordinates of the instant centres in an instant-centre
walk.
The second part of the proposed method shows
that if one of the instant-centre walks is closed to
form an instant-centre circuit, then the location of one
of the undetermined SICs in the circuit can be ana-
lytically evaluated by solving a quadratic polynomial
equation, based on the recursive formula developed
in the first part. Consequently the positions of all the
other SICs in the circuit can be located recursively. In
addition, it is shown that by combining the recurrence
conditions of several related instant-centre walks, the
location of certain SICs, which is not contained in
any of the instant-centre circuits, can also be evalu-
ated analytically by solving a fourth-order polynomial
equation.
The proposed method is novel in the sense that it is
derived on the basis of topological information of the
linkage alone, and it can be systematically applied to
all types of indeterminate linkages, regardless of the
complexity of the coupled kinematic loops. Therefore,
it can be easily implemented on a digital computer
for automated analysis. Three numerical examples are
presented in this article to demonstrate the usage of
this method.
2 CLASSIFICATIONOFTHE SICS
As defined by Foster and Pennock [5], a primary
instant centre (PIC) of a linkage is referred as the
one which can be directly located by inspecting the
kinematic structure of the linkage, such as those asso-
ciated with permanent connections between the links.
Those of which cannot be directly located by inspec-
tion but should be deduced from the knowledge of
other instant centres are referred as the SIC of the
linkage.
It is well known that a general method for locating
the SICs of a given linkage is to use the circle diagram
for bookkeeping and the Aronhold–Kennedy theorem
to recursively evaluate these instant centres one by one
by finding the intersection point of the two pole-lines
(i.e. the straight line that constitutes the three instant
centres of three links moving relative to one another),
which contains the instant centre in question. How-
ever, for indeterminate linkages, this method would
be stalled at a point where no two related pole-lines
can be found for an undetermined SIC, and hence
cannot be carried out further. To discriminate this sit-
uation the SICs are further classified into three classes,
according to their level of dependencies.
To facilitate the follow-up presentations, a PIC
between links i and j is denoted as Ji,j and a SIC as
Ii,j . The first class of SIC of a given linkage is defined as
the ones for which at least two independent pole-lines
corresponding to them can be obtained from the PICs
of the linkage, and hence their location is indepen-
dent of other SICs and can be readily evaluated. For
example, the initial state of the circle diagram of the
single-flier eight-bar linkage shown in Fig. 1 is given in
Fig. 2, from which it can be observed that the SICs I1,3
and I2,4 are of this class.

Fig. 4 Instant-centre digraph of the double butterfly linkage
for the edges incident with a third-class SIC can only
point outward from it. In addition, a closed instant-
centre walk in which the starting and ending SICs are
the same is referred to as an instant-centre circuit, and
it follows that it is not possible to form such a circuit
for a third-class SIC.
The instant-centre walk gives a directed relationship
between the two end vertices; as will be shown in the
next section, it is useful for establishing a recursive
computational scheme to evaluate the coordinates
of the unknown instant centres. It should, however,
be noted that the instant-centre walk between two
given vertices may not be defined uniquely. Never-
theless, to save computational time, it is desirable
to find the walk that consists of the least amount of
the intermediate vertices. This is known as the short-
est path problem in the graph theory, which can be
solved by several existing graph-theoretic algorithms.
In this article, the breadth-first search algorithm is
employed to determine the shortest instant-centre
walks [8].
4 RECURSIVE COMPUTATIONAL SCHEME FOR
INSTANT-CENTREWALK
The instant-centre walk between two SICs, Ii,j and
Ik,l , is denoted as {S1, S2, . . . , Si−1, Si, Si+1, . . . , Sn}, where
S1 = Ii,j and Sn = Ik,l . Since S2 must be a second-class
SIC, one of its pole-line is known and can be written
into the point–slope form as
S2,y = m1S2,x + c1 (1)
where
m1 = p1,y − p2,yp1,x − p2,x (2)
and
c1 = −p2,xp1,y + p1,xp2,yp1,x − p2,x (3)
where (p1,x ,p1,y) and (p2,x ,p2,y) are the coordinates of
the two PICs, P1 and P2, respectively, associated with
the known pole-line of S2, as shown in Fig. 5. In addi-
tion, according to the property of the instant-centre
walk, S2 must also lies on a pole-line defined by S1 and
another PIC, P3, as shown in the figure, which can also
be written the point–slope form as
S2,y = m2S2,x + c2 (4)
where
m2 = S1,y − p3,yS1,x − p3,x (5)
and
c2 = −p3,xS1,y + S1,xp3,yS1,x − p3,x (6)
where (S1,x , S1,y) denotes the coordinates of S1. By
simultaneously solving equations (1) and (4), it follows

496 C-MKung and L-CTWang
at infinity along line L, which is perpendicular to the
sliding direction of the slider, and the pole-line defined
by S1, S2, and P3 should be parallel to L. Therefore, by
using the two-point form, equation (4), in this case,
can be modified to
S2y − S1y
S2x − S1x = mL
where mL is the slope of line L. Again, if mL = ∞, then
the equation would be reduced to
S2x = S1x
Moreover, it should be pointed out that if the two pole-
lines coincide with each other, then equations (1) and
(4) would become linear dependent and, therefore, no
unique intersection point of the two lines can be deter-
mined. For example, the four PICs, J1,2, J2,3, J3,4, and J1,4,
of the four-bar linkage at the configuration illustrated
in Fig. 7 lie on the same straight line, thus the SICs
I1,3 and I2,4 cannot be uniquely located without know-
ing the speed ratio of the input and the output link at
the instance. As this situation would only occur under
certain singular configurations of the linkages having
special link dimensions and can only be handled by
specifying additional velocity information of the link-
age, therefore, it is not dealt with in this article and only
the more general non-singular cases are considered.
By using the same procedure, the coordinates of the
third-class SIC in the given walk, S3 can be written as
functions of that of S2 as
S3,x = A3,2S2,x + A3,1S2,y + A3,0B3,2S2,x + B3,1S2,y + B3,0 (9)
S3,y = D3,2S2,x +D3,1S2,y +D3,0B3,2S2,x + B3,1S2,y + B3,0 (10)
where
A3,2 = (−p5,xp4,y + p4,xp5,y) − p6,y(p4,x − p5,x)
A3,1 = p6,x(p4,x − p5,x)
A3,0 = −p6,x(−p5,xp4,y + p4,xp5,y)
B3,2 = −(p4,y − p5,y)
B2,1 = (p4,x − p5,x)
B2,0 = p6,x(p4,y − p5,y) − p6,y(p4,x − p5,x)
D3,2 = −p6,y(p4,y − p5,y)
D3,1 = (−p5,xp4,y + p4,xp5,y) + p6,x(p4,y − p5,y)
D3,0 = −p6,y(−p5,xp4,y + p4,xp5,y)
Fig. 7 Singular configuration of a four-bar linkage
where (p4,x ,p4,y), (p5,x ,p5,y), and (p6,x ,p6,y) are the coor-
dinates of the PICs P4,P5, and P6, corresponding to the
known pole-lines of S2 and S3, as shown in Fig. 5.
Consequently, the functional relationship between
the coordinates of two successive SICs, Si and Si−1, i =
2–n, in the given walk, can be written in the general
form as
Si,x = Ai,2Si−1,x + Ai,1Si−1,y + Ai,0Bi,2Si−1,x + Bi,1Si−1,y + Bi,0 (11)
Si,y = Di,2Si−1,x +Di,1Si−1,y +Di,0Bi,2Si−1,x + Bi,1Si−1,y + Bi,0 (12)
where
Ai,2 = (−p3i−4,xp3i−5,y + p3i−5,xp3i−4,y)
− p3i−3,y(p3i−5,x − p3i−4,x)
Ai,1 = p3i−3,x(p3i−5,x − p3i−4,x)
Ai,0 = −p3i−3,x(−p3i−4,xp3i−5,y + p3i−5,xp3i−4,y)
Bi,2 = −(p3i−5,y − p3i−4,y)
Bi,1 = (p3i−5,x − p3i−4,x)
Bi,0 = p3i−3,x(p3i−5,y−p3i−4,y)−p3i−3,y(p3i−5,x − p3i−4,x)
Di,2 = −p3i−3,y(p3i−5,y − p3i−4,y)
Di,1 = (−p3i−4,xp3i−5,y + p3i−5,xp3i−4,y)
+ p3i−3,x(p3i−5,y − p3i−4,y)
Di,0 = −p3i−3,y(−p3i−4,xp3i−5,y + p3i−5,xp3i−4,y)
are constant coefficients in terms of the coordinates of
the PICs P3i−5,P3i−4, and P3i−3 shown in Fig. 5.
Equations (11) and (12) give the basic recursive
relationship between two successive SICs in a given
instant-centre walk; by recursively applying these
equations from the first SIC to the ith SIC, the coordi-
nates of any SIC in the walk can be expressed in terms
of that of the first one as
Si,x = Ui,2S1,x +Ui,1S1,y +Ui,0Vi,2S1,x + Vi,1S1,y + Vi,0 (13)
Si,y = Wi,2S1,x +Wi,1S1,y +Wi,0Vi,2S1,x + Vi,1S1,y + Vi,0 (14)
where
Ui,2 = Ai,2Ai−1,2 + Ai,1Di−1,2 + Ai,0Bi−1,2
Ui,1 = Ai,2Ai−1,1 + Ai,1Di−1,1 + Ai,0Bi−1,1
Ui,0 = Ai,2Ai−1,0 + Ai,1Di−1,0 + Ai,0Bi−1,0
Vi,2 = Bi,2Ai−1,2 + Bi,1Di−1,2 + Bi,0Bi−1,2
Vi,1 = Bi,2Ai−1,1 + Bi,1Di−1,1 + Bi,0Bi−1,1
Vi,0 = Bi,2Ai−1,0 + Bi,1Di−1,0 + Bi,0Bi−1,0
Wi,2 = Di,2Ai−1,2 +Di,1Di−1,2 +Di,0Bi−1,2

method described in this section, as they are not
contained within any instant-centre circuit. The pro-
cedure for resolving these difficulties is presented in
section 6.
6 LOCATING SICS NOTWITHIN AN
INSTANT-CENTRE CIRCUIT
As illustrated in Fig. 8, Ii,k is a second-class SIC that lies
on a known pole-line L defined by the two PICs,P1 and
P2, but it is not contained in any instant-centre circuit.
Ii,j , Ij,k , Ii,l , and Il,k are four second-class SICs, which are
implicitly related to Ii,k , and the instant-centre walks of
them from a common second-class SIC, S1, are known.
Therefore, by using equations (16) and (17), the coor-
dinates of Ii,j and Ij,k can be expressed in terms of that
of S1 as
Iij,x = Ei,1S1,x + Ei,0Gi,1S1,x + Gi,0 (21)
Iij,y = Hi,1S1,x +Hi,0Gi,1S1,x + Gi,0 (22)
and
Ijk,x = Ej,1S1,x + Ej,0Gj,1S1,x + Gj,0 (23)
Ijk,y = Hj,1S1,x +Hj,0Gj,1S1,x + Gj,0 (24)
According to the Aronhold–Kennedy theorem, Ii,k
must be located at the intersection point of the pole-
line defined by Ii,j and Ij,k and line L. By substituting
equations (21) to (24) into the two-point form of the
equation of the pole-line and then solving for the
Fig. 8 Locating a SIC which is outside of an instant-
centre circuit
intersection point of the two lines, one obtains
Iik,x = M2S

1,x +M1S1,x +M0
N2S21,x +N1S1,x +N0
(25)
Iik,y = Q2S
2
1,x +Q1S1,x +Q0
N2S21,x +N1S1,x +N0
(26)
where Mi,Ni, and Qi (i = 0, 1, 2) are constant coeffi-
cients.
Based on the same approach, the coordinates of Ii,k
can also be derived in the same form as equations
(25) and (26) as the intersection point of the pole-
line defined by Ii,l and Il,k and line L. Consequently,
by equating the x-component of Ii,k obtained from the
two sides and rearranging a fourth-order polynomial
equation in terms of S1,x can be derived as
R4S41,x + R3S31,x + R2S21,x + R1S1,x + R0 = 0 (27)
where Ri (i = 0 − 4) are constant coefficients.
At most four real solutions of S1,x can be obtained
from equation (27), and each can be substituted into
equations (25) and (26) to obtain the coordinates of Ii,k .
However, it should be noted that only the one which is
consistent with the given configuration of the mech-
anism is the true solution. It should also be pointed
out that this method can only be applied to the SICs
of the second class. Nevertheless, once the locations of
these SICs are evaluated, they can be upgraded to PICs,
and accordingly, some of the third-class SICs can then
be upgraded to the second class and the evaluation
process can be continued.
7 NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
Based on the methods presented in the preceding
sections, a computer program written in MATLAB is
developed for locating the SICs of indeterminate pla-
nar linkages. This program has been extensively tested
on a variety of eight-link and ten-link indeterminate
linkages and has found no difficulty in identifying and
locating all of the SICs of these linkages (the posi-
tion analysis of these linkages is performed separately
by using the Working Model two-dimensional soft-
ware package). Three examples are presented in this
section to demonstrate the usage and effectiveness of
the program.
The linkage used for the first example is the double
butterfly eight-link linkage shown in Fig. 3. For com-
parison purposes, the dimension and configuration of
the linkage are specified the same as in the example
presented by Foster and Pennock [4]. The coordinates
of the ten PICs with respect to the given configuration
are listed in Table 1. A total of 17 instant-centre cir-
cuits are found, as listed in Table 2, by applying the
breadth-first search algorithm to the instant-centre
digraph of the linkage as shown in Fig. 4. The first

of which 23 are of the second class and nine are of the
third class; the instant-centre digraph of these SICs is
given in Fig. 11. For this linkage, four instant-centre cir-
cuits have been found from the instant-centre digraph,
as listed in Table 6. However, it turned out that none
of the circuits is non-trivial, and hence the SICs of this
linkage cannot be analysed in the same way as the per-
vious two examples. Instead, the method presented in
section 6 must be employed.
