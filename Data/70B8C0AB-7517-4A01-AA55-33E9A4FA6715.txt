 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was originally proposed in 1995 [5]. Unlike ML approach exhaustively finding 
all possible solutions in the solution space, PSO is a kind of evolutionary computation techniques like genetic algorithm (GA). It 
can estimate all CFOs at a time. PSO randomly generates some particles (candidate solutions), which fly in the space to find the 
best solution according to individual and whole experiences. Recently, a CFO estimation approach based on PSO [6] demonstrates 
that it can achieve performance close to ML scheme with much less computational complexity. However, its performance is still 
unacceptable as systems loading increases. 
To address the issues mentioned above, an enhanced PSO-based CFOs estimator by employing mutation and repulsion 
operations is proposed in this paper. Also, compensation technique for MAI will be developed to improve the estimation accuracy. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II derives an objective function based on log-likelihood function for 
estimation of CFOs occurred in the uplink OFDMA systems. Also, MAI compensation scheme for improving the estimated CFOs 
is introduced. Then a mutation and repulsion-based PSO (MRPSO) is presented in Section III to optimize the derived objective 
function. Simulation results are presented in Section IV and finally the conclusions are drawn in Section V. 
II. ESTIMATION AND COMPENSATION OF CFOS IN UPLINK OFDMA SYSTEMS 
Fig. 1 shows systems diagram of a uplink OFDMA systems where K  active users communicate with the base station (BS) 
simultaneously. We assume the following conditions:  
1) The total number of subcarriers is N .  
2) Each user occupies /N K  subcarriers to transmit individual data. 
3) Ideal timing synchronization.

III. PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION 
A. Fundamental of PSO algorithm  
PSO algorithm [6] is a kind of evolutionary computation techniques with the concept of swarm intelligence. Like genetic 
algorithm (GA), PSO algorithm is also an evolutionary searching scheme. The same part of these two algorithms is that both the 
initial populations are randomly generated, and both search for the optimum value by evolution. However, instead of using 
crossover and mutation to evolve, PSO algorithm evolves by following the best particle of the swarm in the searching space, 
which is different from GA.  
The original PSO (OPSO) algorithm [5] updates position and velocity of particles (candidate solutions) for next generation 
with the following rule:

where giv  is the i-th particle’s K-dimensional velocity in the g-th generation, 1gi v  is the i-th particle’s velocity in the (g+1)-th 
generation, 1c  and 2c  are learning factors where 1c  is called individual factor and 2c  is called social factor which indicate that 
each particle cooperates and shares information with others, and usually 1 2 2c c  . ,1 ,2 ,[ , ,..., ]g g g gi i i i Kb b bb  is the i-th particle in the g-th 
generation whose dimension is K . pbestib  is the best position of the i-th particle recorded in its individual memory. gbestb  is the 
best particle in the swarm. ()rand  is a random variables generator for generating K-dimensional random variables uniformly 
distributed over [0, 1]. The value of v  is limited with the upper bound of maxv ; larger maxv  helps global search and smaller maxv  
helps local search. Notably, maxv  determines the convergent speed of PSO. 
The work in [8] exploited inertia weight to improve the convergent feature of PSO algorithm. giv  is multiplied by a inertia 
weight w to compromise the global search and local search. The renewed formulas are:

diversity is smaller than 
lowD . The search mechanism of ARPSO is similar to that of LPSO before repulsive operation is 
performed. As the performance of LPSO is inferior to the LPSO_Mut, ARPSO requires to perform attractive operation after 
repulsive operation for searching better solution. However, this results in a longer convergent time. Though LPSO_Mut has higher 
particles diversity [6] than LPSO, in high-dimensional solution space, one-dimensional mutation for particles being gathered in 
the converging stage will be insufficient for searching the best solution. In order to improve the shortcomings of slow 
convergence in ARPSO and insufficient diversity in LSPO_Mut, a new scheme called Mutated_Repulsive_PSO (MRPSO) is 
proposed in this work by combining mutation and repulsive operations. The execution steps of the proposed MRPSO are given in 
Eq. (24)-(26), where   and G  represent repulsion probability and number of repulsion generations, respectively.

In other words, MRPSO performs (24) to separate particles if (0,  1) rand   and g G  for each generation. Otherwise 
performs (25) to move particles toward gbest . In the early-intermediate stage, MRPSO executes repulsion operation with certain 
probability to allow particles to escape from local optimum. Then part of the particles will be selected to perform mutation in 
order to increase diversity until G  is reached. Notably, G  determines the convergence rate of MRPSO. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Assume that the number of subcarriers N is 128. A series of simulations was conducted under multipath Rayleigh fading 
channel. The channel delay spread is less than the length of CP ( 32GN  ), and CFO is distributed over [-0.5, 0.5]. In the 
simulations, the number of particles (M) is set to 60. Table I shows simulation parameters of MRPSO for various user numbers. 
Notably, the repulsive probability  , the number of repulsive generation G , and thresholds of lowD
 and highD ,  are 
empirically determined.

A. Convergences of various PSO schemes  
Table II illustrates the generations required for convergence corresponding to each schemes. As given in Table II, all three 
schemes require similar generations for convergence when K=2 and 4. However, for K=8, 16 and 32, ARPSO needs the longest 
generations for convergence while LPSO_Mut is the shortest.

where maxw  and minw  are respectively the initial and final 
values of inertia weight. G  is the maximum number of 
generations (or iterations), and g  is the present number of 
iteration. In this method, particles move toward the target at 
a fast speed in the beginning. As the number of generation 
increases, particles are closer to the target, the velocity will 
be decreased to avoid larger moving distance such that 
particles would not leave away from the target. This 
modified PSO is termed LPSO in this study for convenience. 
B. Measurement of diversity of particles 
To evaluate search capability and convergence property 
of PSO, a diversity measurement for particles [6] is adopted 
as below: 
2

M

Diversity

m
M
==
∑b
b
                                 (21) 
where M is the number of particles (candidate solutions), 
L  is the longest distance of the solution space, mb  is 
position of m-th particle, b  is average position of the M 
particles. A higher diversity represents a higher variance of 
position distribution of particles. Contrarily, a lower 
diversity indicates that PSO particles are converging toward 
a promising area. In other words, diversity can be used as an 
index to determine if the PSO is under the exploration 
(global search) or exploitation (local search) stages. 
C. Attractive and repulsive PSO  
Insufficient diversity is a main shortcoming of common 
original PSO algorithms. To overcome this difficulty, a 
mutation scheme has been proposed to be introduced into 
LPSO to increase the diversity of particles [6]. Operation of 
this scheme is as follows. In the first stage, 1 Mα ×  particles 
are selected. In the second stage, one mutation point for 
each selected particle is randomly chosen, and then is 
mutated with a rate of 2α . That is, the sign of each selected 
point is changed from positive (negative) to negative 
(positive) if a uniformly generated random number γ  is 
smaller than 2α . The second stage aims to increase particle 
diversity meanwhile prevent the population from being 
randomized. In other words, 2α  compromises the diversity 
and convergence of the PSO algorithm. The values of 1α  
and 2α  are suggested to be 0.1 and 0.65, respectively [6]. 
Attractive and repulsive PSO (ARPSO) is a diversity-
guided particle swarm optimizer [9] where attractive 
operation makes particles to come close while repulsive 
operation separates particles from each other. As given in 
(22), ARPSO performs the attractive operation as direction 
is positive ( 1dir = ); otherwise, performs repulsive 
operation ( -1dir = ). The sign of dir is determined based on 
the rule of (23), where thresholds of lowD  and highD  are 
suggested to be the converged diversity of LPSO and a half 
of the maximum diversity [9].

D. Mutation and repulsion-based PSO (MRPSO) 
While PSO has the potential in finding global optimum 
( gbest ) via gradual convergence of particles, it may only 
find a local optimum due to insufficient diversity. Therefore, 
ARPSO executes repulsive operation to escape from local 
optimum when diversity is smaller than lowD . The search 
mechanism of ARPSO is similar to that of LPSO before 
repulsive operation is performed. As the performance of 
LPSO is inferior to the LPSO_Mut, ARPSO requires to 
perform attractive operation after repulsive operation for 
searching better solution. However, this results in a longer 
convergent time. Though LPSO_Mut has higher particles 
diversity [6] than LPSO, in high-dimensional solution space, 
one-dimensional mutation for particles being gathered in the 
converging stage will be insufficient for searching the best 
solution. In order to improve the shortcomings of slow 
convergence in ARPSO and insufficient diversity in 
LSPO_Mut, a new scheme called Mutated_Repulsive_PSO 
(MRPSO) is proposed in this work by combining mutation 
and repulsive operations. The execution steps of the 
proposed MRPSO are given in Eq. (24)-(26), where γ  and 
Gγ  represent repulsion probability and number of repulsion 
generations, respectively.
