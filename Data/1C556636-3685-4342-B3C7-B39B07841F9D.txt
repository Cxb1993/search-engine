Abstract 
This research focuses on both the order 
batching problem and arrangement of the 
pick routings within aisles. A mathematical 
model is developed to minimize the system 
picking time which is represented by the 
longest time of picking orders. A heuristic 
solution algorithm is then developed to solve 
the order batching problem and the in-aisle 
routing problem. The solution algorithm for 
the in-aisle picking routes is constructed by 
using the logic of simulated annealing. The 
results of illustration problems indicate the 
proposed solution algorithm can increase the 
overall efficiency for the warehouse of 
distribution center. 
Keywords: Distribution Center, In-aisle 
Routing Problem, Order 
Batching Problems.

closed-loop track in either clockwise direction or counterclockwise direction. On each floor, the 
location of elevator, i.e. the decision variable, is the only one point for materials exit and entrance 
for vertical transportation. In addition, all P/D points on each floor are given, fixed, and known. For 
simplification purpose, it is also assumed that the moving track on all floors have the same 
configuration and length as indicated in Figure 1. Since one elevator performs all vertical 
movements and the moving track has the same pattern on each floor, therefore, this elevator will be 
located at the same coordinates of loop on each floor. The optimal location of elevator is the major 
problem area to be investigated in this research. Based on the assumptions and analysis mentioned 
above, the location problem of this research can be further defined in a mathematical model which 
will be presented in section 2.

The problem discussed in this research is similar to the problems of tandem AGV system, 
especially for the problems of zone configuration and zone transfer point in the tandem AGV 
system. On previous researches, Chen(1995) and Huang(1997) proposed a solution concept and 
procedure for finding a better transfer location on each zone in a tandem AGV system. This research 
assumed unique moving direction on each zone and one single transfer point for each zone. 
For the problems assuming bi-directional movement, Chen(1997) and Huang(2001) proposed 
a similar solution procedure to find the optimal transportation center on each zone in a tandem AGV 
system. This research will extend this solution concept to solving the problem of elevator location 
in the multi-floor layout environment. 
2. The Model and Solution Approach 
This section will clearly define the problem and the necessary assumptions in subsection 2.1. 
A comprehensive objective function and a simplified objective function are described and analyzed 
in subsection 2.2. Since the solution concept of this research is based on a previous problem of 
tandem AGV system, therefore, the subsection 2.3 will first describes how to find the optimal 
location of transfer point for a single zone in a tandem AGV system. The solution concept of this 
research problem is then developed by extending the transfer point location to the elevator location 
in multi-floor environment. This solution concept is further proved in subsection 3.2 by using 
exhaustive search on a numerical example.

workstation i belong to and ending at the elevator point of the floor which the workstation j 
belong to. 
 
On a system view point, the objective function should minimize the total moving distance 
including the horizontal movements and the vertical movements, as indicated in equation (1). In 
equation (1), the first three terms involve all horizontal movements, which are: (i)the moves 
between workstations on the same floors, (ii)the moves from workstations to the elevator on the 
same floors, and (iii)the moves from the elevator to workstations on the same floors. The fourth 
term in equation (1) includes all vertical transportations performed by the elevator.

Based on the problem statement and assumptions in this study, the location of each 
workstation is fixed and given, therefore, the value of the first term in equation (1) becomes a 
constant. Since each workstation has been assigned to an appropriate floor, all the vertical moving 
distances i.e. the fourth term of equation (1), become a constant either. Equation (1) can be 
simplified to equation (2).

By observing equation (2), the optimal location of the elevator can be selected on the basis of 
horizontal flow distances. In addition, the location which generates the minimal total flow distance

Dummy Floor 
This research extends this concept to solve the optimal location of elevator on the multi-floor 
environment, as shown in Figure 3 (A) and (B). By applying the solution concept indicated in 
Figure 2, on each floor, the optimal location of elevator can be found from one of the following 
locations: the locations of workstation and the locations of opposite workstation. From Figure 3 (A), 
the optimal location of the second floor can be selected from the following points: 4, 5, 6, 4+, 5+, 6+. 
From Figure 3 (B), the optimal location of the first floor can be selected from the following points: 
1, 2, 3, 1+, 2+, 3+. 
Since (i) the cost on each floor has a linear relationship between two neighborhood points and 
(ii) the cost of one floor is independent with other floors, it is possible to derive the relationships of 
the total cost, i.e. sum of all costs. Several phenomena of total cost can be summarized as follows. 
(a)  A linear total flow cost relationship can be concluded between any two neighborhood points. 
(b)  The optimal location of elevator can be selected from the location set with limited points.  
(c)  This location set is consisting of (i) locations of existing workstations on all floors, and (ii) 
locations of opposite workstation on all floors.  
For better explanation the above phenomena (b) and (c), a dummy floor is presented in Figure 
3 (C). The moving track in Figure 3 (C) has the same configuration and closed-loop length as 
shown in Figure 3 (A) and Figure 3 (B). The workstations plotted in Figure 3 (C) are projected from 
both the first floor and the second floor. In addition, the opposite workstations are also projected 
from the first and the second floor. Therefore, location set in this case includes the following 12

Based on the objective function presented in equation (2), only the horizontal flow quantities 
between different floors are critical for the decision of elevator location. The detailed horizontal 
flow quantities in this example can be calculated as follows.

The coordinates of the elevator on the closed-loop track is x which is also a decision variable

3.3 Solution procedure 
Based on the common phenomena presented in section 3.2, a solution procedure for the 
elevator location can be summarized in the following steps. 
Step 0:  Consolidate the coordinates system in each floor including the original point and 
coordinates direction (i.e. coordinates based on clockwise direction or counterclockwise 
direction). 
Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the P/D (Pick-up and Drop-off) points on the moving track for 
all workstations on all floors. Identify the coordinates of the opposite P/D points on the 
moving track for all workstations on all floors. 
Step 2: Project all the P/D points and the opposite P/D points to a dummy floor. Obtain coordinates 
of all points on the dummy floor. 
Step 3: Calculate horizontal flow-in and flow-out quantity for each workstation on the dummy 
floor, i.e. all flow quantities between the workstation and the elevator. 
Step 4: Calculate total moving distance for all candidate points on the dummy floor.  
Step 5: The optimal location of the elevator can be selected from one of the candidate points. The 
point with the minimal total moving distance is the optimal location for the elevator. 
 
3.4 One possible application 
It is interesting to further investigate the flow distance variation on the first floor and on the 
second floor separately, as indicated in Figure 7. In this example, the flow distance on each floor 
has different variation and trend. The optimal location (i.e. the location with the minimal flow 
distance) on each floor may not be the same coordinates. However, if some restriction can be 
reduced or some assumption can be modified, it is possible to further reduce the total floor distance 
(objective function value).  
On the same floor, if the moving track can be rotated with workstations on either clockwise or 
counterclockwise direction, the distance between two workstations are kept the same. In this 
situation, it is possible to consolidate the optimal location on different floor into one single 
coordinates (point). Consequently, the total flow distance is equal to sum of the optimal flow 
distance on each floor. Usually, the “new” total flow distance will be better than the “original” total 
flow distance. Based on this concept and using the data presented in Figure 7, the optimal location 
for the first floor, i.e. W2, and the optimal location for the second floor, i.e. W6, can be rotated to 
same point (i.e. same coordinates). By observing points in Figure 7, the “new” objective function

closed-loop track in either clockwise direction or counterclockwise direction. On each floor, the 
location of elevator, i.e. the decision variable, is the only one point for materials exit and entrance 
for vertical transportation. In addition, all P/D points on each floor are given, fixed, and known. For 
simplification purpose, it is also assumed that the moving track on all floors have the same 
configuration and length as indicated in Figure 1. Since one elevator performs all vertical 
movements and the moving track has the same pattern on each floor, therefore, this elevator will be 
located at the same coordinates of loop on each floor. The optimal location of elevator is the major 
problem area to be investigated in this research. Based on the assumptions and analysis mentioned 
above, the location problem of this research can be further defined in a mathematical model which 
will be presented in section 2.

The problem discussed in this research is similar to the problems of tandem AGV system, 
especially for the problems of zone configuration and zone transfer point in the tandem AGV 
system. On previous researches, Chen(1995) and Huang(1997) proposed a solution concept and 
procedure for finding a better transfer location on each zone in a tandem AGV system. This research 
assumed unique moving direction on each zone and one single transfer point for each zone. 
For the problems assuming bi-directional movement, Chen(1997) and Huang(2001) proposed 
a similar solution procedure to find the optimal transportation center on each zone in a tandem AGV 
system. This research will extend this solution concept to solving the problem of elevator location 
in the multi-floor layout environment. 
2. The Model and Solution Approach 
This section will clearly define the problem and the necessary assumptions in subsection 2.1. 
A comprehensive objective function and a simplified objective function are described and analyzed 
in subsection 2.2. Since the solution concept of this research is based on a previous problem of 
tandem AGV system, therefore, the subsection 2.3 will first describes how to find the optimal 
location of transfer point for a single zone in a tandem AGV system. The solution concept of this 
research problem is then developed by extending the transfer point location to the elevator location 
in multi-floor environment. This solution concept is further proved in subsection 3.2 by using 
exhaustive search on a numerical example.

On a system view point, the objective function should minimize the total moving distance 
including the horizontal movements and the vertical movements, as indicated in equation (1). In 
equation (1), the first three terms involve all horizontal movements, which are: (i)the moves 
between workstations on the same floors, (ii)the moves from workstations to the elevator on the 
same floors, and (iii)the moves from the elevator to workstations on the same floors. The fourth 
term in equation (1) includes all vertical transportations performed by the elevator.

Based on the problem statement and assumptions in this study, the location of each 
workstation is fixed and given, therefore, the value of the first term in equation (1) becomes a 
constant. Since each workstation has been assigned to an appropriate floor, all the vertical moving 
distances i.e. the fourth term of equation (1), become a constant either. Equation (1) can be 
simplified to equation (2).

By observing equation (2), the optimal location of the elevator can be selected on the basis of

This research extends this concept to solve the optimal location of elevator on the multi-floor 
environment, as shown in Figure 3 (A) and (B). By applying the solution concept indicated in 
Figure 2, on each floor, the optimal location of elevator can be found from one of the following 
locations: the locations of workstation and the locations of opposite workstation. From Figure 3 (A), 
the optimal location of the second floor can be selected from the following points: 4, 5, 6, 4+, 5+, 6+. 
From Figure 3 (B), the optimal location of the first floor can be selected from the following points: 
1, 2, 3, 1+, 2+, 3+. 
Since (i) the cost on each floor has a linear relationship between two neighborhood points and 
(ii) the cost of one floor is independent with other floors, it is possible to derive the relationships of 
the total cost, i.e. sum of all costs. Several phenomena of total cost can be summarized as follows. 
(a)  A linear total flow cost relationship can be concluded between any two neighborhood points. 
(b)  The optimal location of elevator can be selected from the location set with limited points.  
(c)  This location set is consisting of (i) locations of existing workstations on all floors, and (ii) 
locations of opposite workstation on all floors.  
For better explanation the above phenomena (b) and (c), a dummy floor is presented in Figure 
3 (C). The moving track in Figure 3 (C) has the same configuration and closed-loop length as 
shown in Figure 3 (A) and Figure 3 (B). The workstations plotted in Figure 3 (C) are projected from 
both the first floor and the second floor. In addition, the opposite workstations are also projected 
from the first and the second floor. Therefore, location set in this case includes the following 12 
points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+, 6+. The optimal location of should be one of these 12 points. 
Section 3.2 presents an exhaustive search based on a numerical example. The searching results can 
confirm three phenomena described in this subsection.

3.3 Solution procedure 
Based on the common phenomena presented in section 3.2, a solution procedure for the 
elevator location can be summarized in the following steps. 
Step 0:  Consolidate the coordinates system in each floor including the original point and 
coordinates direction (i.e. coordinates based on clockwise direction or counterclockwise 
direction). 
Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the P/D (Pick-up and Drop-off) points on the moving track for 
all workstations on all floors. Identify the coordinates of the opposite P/D points on the 
moving track for all workstations on all floors. 
Step 2: Project all the P/D points and the opposite P/D points to a dummy floor. Obtain coordinates 
of all points on the dummy floor. 
Step 3: Calculate horizontal flow-in and flow-out quantity for each workstation on the dummy 
floor, i.e. all flow quantities between the workstation and the elevator. 
Step 4: Calculate total moving distance for all candidate points on the dummy floor.  
Step 5: The optimal location of the elevator can be selected from one of the candidate points. The 
point with the minimal total moving distance is the optimal location for the elevator. 
 
3.4 One possible application 
It is interesting to further investigate the flow distance variation on the first floor and on the 
second floor separately, as indicated in Figure 7. In this example, the flow distance on each floor 
has different variation and trend. The optimal location (i.e. the location with the minimal flow 
distance) on each floor may not be the same coordinates. However, if some restriction can be 
reduced or some assumption can be modified, it is possible to further reduce the total floor distance 
(objective function value).  
On the same floor, if the moving track can be rotated with workstations on either clockwise or 
counterclockwise direction, the distance between two workstations are kept the same. In this 
situation, it is possible to consolidate the optimal location on different floor into one single 
coordinates (point). Consequently, the total flow distance is equal to sum of the optimal flow 
distance on each floor. Usually, the “new” total flow distance will be better than the “original” total 
flow distance. Based on this concept and using the data presented in Figure 7, the optimal location 
for the first floor, i.e. W2, and the optimal location for the second floor, i.e. W6, can be rotated to 
same point (i.e. same coordinates). By observing points in Figure 7, the “new” objective function
