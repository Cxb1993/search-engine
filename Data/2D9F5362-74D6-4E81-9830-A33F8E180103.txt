1. Introduction
Photocatalysis is a promising technique valuable for environ-
mental and renewable energy applications. Among various
semiconductor photocatalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is espe-
cially attractive for their non-toxic, clean and safe properties as
well as their thermal stability and the abundance in the earth [1,2].
It has become one of the most suitable for widespread environ-
mental applications, such as dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical
(PEC) cells [3], gas sensors [4], self-cleaning surfaces, water
splitting for hydrogen evolution, etc. [1,5]. Great efforts have been
employed to facilitate charge transport and charge separation
efﬁciency of TiO2 thin ﬁlm coupled with a large bandgap
semiconductor, such as SnO2 [6], amorphous WO3 [7,8] and
indium tin oxide (ITO) [9,10], or a high work functionmetal, e.g. Al,
Ti, Fe, Pd [11], Pt [12,13] and carbon nanotube [10,14–15] as
heterostructured ﬁlm electrodes. Layered TiO2/ITO ﬁlm is gen-
erally accepted to be a efﬁcient heterostructure and provide a
potential driving force for the separation of photogenerated charge
carriers [9,16].
Recently, Dai et al. have reported that the layered TiO2/ITO
catalyst can beneﬁt the photocatalytic (PC) reactions mainly
inducing by the photogenerated holes rather than by the electrons
[9]. This is because that ITO has a higher work function than TiO2
and a depletion layer can form at the TiO2/ITO interface, where the
ITO thin ﬁlm accepts electrons. The Schottky barrier height can
enhance the photogenerated electron transfer from the TiO2 ﬁlm to
the ITO substrate, leading a higher photocatalytic degradation rate
over aqueous oleic acid solution. However, according to their X-ray
photoelectron spectroscope tests, no reaction occurs between TiO2
and ITO substrate, which is prepared by dip coating route.
A TiO2 ﬁlm deposited on ITO substrate has a more crystalline
structure than one deposited on other substrates, such as Si, glass,
quartz or Al2O3 [16,17]. Anatase TiO2 nanocrystalline ﬁlms that
were grown with a thickness of 5mm on as-received ITO (aITO)

This study elucidates how indium tin oxide (ITO) thin ﬁlm affects themicrostructural and photocatalytic
properties of layered TiO2/ITO ﬁlms prepared by DC magnetron sputtering. Two ITO substrates, as-
received ITO (aITO) and in situ sputtered ITO (sITO), are adopted herein. Photocatalytic measurements of
methylene blue and dimethyl sulfoxide indicate that the layered TiO2/sITO ﬁlm has greater
photocatalytic oxidation than the TiO2/aITO catalyst. According to photoelectrochemical tests, the
latter exhibits a completely opposite activity to that of the former. Secondary ion mass spectrometry
elemental depth proﬁles reveal that tin atoms in the sITO ﬁlm really permeate into the growing TiO2 ﬁlm
and promote the formation of the crystalline Ti1xSnxO2 layer. Additionally, cross-sectional transmission
electron microscopy images and the selective area diffraction patterns show the difference between the
diffusion of tin in the two catalysts. The photocatalytic oxidation capability is further enhanced in the
layered TiO2/sITO ﬁlm because of an increase in the bandgap energy and a positive shift in the Fermi level
energy of the Ti1xSnxO2 layer. Conversely, tin diffusion is limited in the aITO substrate under controlled
conditions, in such a manner that a Schottky barrier can form at the TiO2/aITO interface. Therefore,
photogenerated electrons can be efﬁciently transferred from the overlaid TiO2 ﬁlm to the aITO substrate,
producing a remarkable photocurrent density under UV illumination. Microstructural measurements
reveal that the growth of the reactive {0 0 1} facets and columnar porous structure are favored by the
synergetic effect of ITO substrate and an extended period of deposition. Accordingly, the photocatalytic
capabilities are further raised.

were used for least-squares reﬁnement of the lattice parameters to
analyze ion different effect.
2.3. Evaluation of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activities
The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by
immersing samples with a size of 25 mm  65 mm into 30 mL
aqueous methylene blue (MB) solution pH (6.8) with an initial
concentration of 10 mg/L (C0). Prior to the PC test, the samples
were soaked in the aqueous MB solution in darkness for
equilibrium surface adsorption. The transmittance of the degraded
MB solution was measured by a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrometer
at a wavelength of 664 nm. All experiments without stirring were
performed under UV-light irradiation (UV-365, 3.5 mW/cm2) at
about 25 8C. The blank experiments were performed under the
identical conditions, but a glass slide or ITO glass substrate was
used instead of a TiO2/ITO ﬁlm. The reaction rate constant was
determined from the linear ﬁtting of ln(C/C0) as a function of
reaction time (t), where C is the residual concentration ofMB in the
degraded MB solution. The reaction times were set at 1 h intervals
from 1 to 5 h.
Forming OHonphotocatalyst surfaces has been considered as a
main reaction mechanism for fast decomposition of various
organic compounds in PC oxidation reactions [1]. Accordingly,
the formation concentrations of these radicals can indicate the
activities of catalyst in PC reactions. A convent technique in terms
of a radical scavengingmethodwhich uses radical sensitive species
as radical captures was applied in this research for quantifying
radical formation concentrations [17]. As an efﬁcient scavenger for
OH, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to react with the
radicals forming the TiO2 ﬁlms. DMSO can react with hydroxyl
radicals to generate formaldehyde (HCHO) as a major reaction
intermediate before complete mineralization. As a result, HCHO
initial formation rates were measured for further determining
radical formation concentrations on the TiO2 catalysts. The HCHO
initial formation rate is proportional to the radical formation
concentration as DMSO can react with most of the radicals,
theoretically. To determine HCHO concentration in solution in the
study, a high performance liquid-phase chromatography (HPLC,
Hitachi Inc., L-7455) with a ﬂuorescent detector was applied.
Before quantifying HCHO concentration with the HPLC, these
HCHO-containing samples (2 mL) were mixed with 2.0-mL NH3
and 0.5-mL 1,3-cyclohexanedione (CHD, 0.46 mM) in tubes to form
ﬂuoresce sensitive mixtures. These mixtures were further ana-
lyzed with the HPLC after being heated for 60 min. The operating
conditions of the HPLC for HCHO quantiﬁcation were summarized
as follows: separation column was Mightysil RP-18 (Supelco,
25 cm  4.6 mm, particle size 5mm), liquid phase (methanol:-
water = 60:40 (v/v)), ﬂow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min isocratic, and
measurement wavelength of the ﬂuoresce detector was set at 400
and 452 nm, respectively. HCHO calibration standards were
purchased from Supelco.
The PEC tests were carried out with a standard PEC three-cell
system that included a sample ﬁlm anode with a working area of
20 mm  50 mm, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference
electrode and a Ptwire counter electrode in a 4.0NNa2CO3 solution
(pH  11) via a potentiostat (CHI 610C, CH Instruments, Inc.). The
Na2CO3 solutionwas purgedwith pure N2 gas for 10 min to remove
dissolved oxygen from the solution before testing, and was
continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer during the tests. The
photocurrent was monitored as the catalyst anode was irradiated
by UV lamps (2.7 mW/cm2). All of the chemicals were of analytical
grade and the electrolyte was prepared with deionized distilled
water. Hydrogen yield rates were determined by analyzing the gas
that was liberated over the Pt cathode using gas chromatography
(GC/TCD, HP4890).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Qualitative SIMS elemental depth proﬁles
The diffusion of substrate species, such as Na and Si in the glass
substrate, into the lattice of the growing TiO2 ﬁlm is a well-known
phenomenon in the deposition of TiO2 ﬁlms. Since the exact nature
of the ﬁnal interface was dominated by the energy that was
deposited by the ions and the chemical interaction between the
affected elements, SIMS depth proﬁles were obtained to determine
the qualitative composition of the layered TiO2/ITO ﬁlms. Figs. 1
and 2 present representative SIMS elemental depth proﬁles of the
multi-stacked mT(6)/sI and T(6)/aI catalysts, respectively. The
mT(6)/sI interface between the sITO and the TiO2 ﬁlms was not
sharp, indicating that substantial ionic diffusion occurred between
layers.More tin diffused into the ﬁrst grown TiO2 ﬁlm from the ﬁrst
sITO thin ﬁlm (measured from the substrate) than into the second
grown TiO2 ﬁlm from the second sITO thin ﬁlm during deposition.
Additionally, the tin intensity in the ﬁrst layer of TiO2 markedly
exceeded that in the third layer, while indium intensity was about
the same magnitude in the two layers. The tin intensity in the ﬁrst
sITO thin ﬁlm was clearly lower than that in the second and third
sITO layers. The tin intensity proﬁle in the third layer was skewed
toward the ﬁlm surface, indicating thatmore tin diffusion occurred
there, which situation contrasts with the approximately uniform
tin intensity across the entire thickness of the T(6)/aI sample in
Fig. 2. Notably, tin permeated into the overlaying TiO2 layer, but
indium diffusion seemed to be negligible.

7.3 and 7.1 at.%, respectively. Positions I2 and i2 close to the TiO2/
sITO interface had a smaller Sn/In ratio of 5.3 and 6.4 at.%,
respectively. At positions T1 and t1 in the TiO2 ﬁlm, the Sn
contents were relatively high (4.7 and 5.7 at.%), whereas at
positions T2 and t2, tin was entirely undetectable. When a high
sputtering power was maintained for a long period, the decline in
the tin concentration as the substrate temperature increased was
considered to increase the segregation of tin at the surface of the
ITO lattices [34]. These results verify that tin in the sITO really
diffused into the growing TiO2 ﬁlm during the deposition
process. Tin diffusion was weaker at the second and the third
TiO2/sITO interfaces in sample mT(6)/sI (not shown). This result
is explained by the fact that the second and third TiO2 ﬁlms were
deposited with a shorter deposition period.
At the corresponding positions on sample T(6)/aI, marked in
Fig. 4, the aITO thin ﬁlm had a typical Sn/In ratio (11.9–12.1 at.%)
and the overlaying TiO2 ﬁlm had an undetectable Sn concentration.
Barely any diffusion was observed at the TiO2/aITO interface in
sample T(6)/aI. These ﬁndings are consistent with the qualitative
SIMS analyses in Section 3.1.
These ﬁndings were further analyzed by measuring the d-
spacings of the ﬁrst TiO2/sITO interfaces of sample mT(6)/sI via
HRTEM images and SAED patterns. Fig. 5 shows a characteristic
HRTEM lattice image of the ﬁrst TiO2/sITO interface along with the
Fourier transform and reconstructed images corresponding to the
microstructures marked with squares (I), (II) and (III). Interplanar
spacings and angles observed in Fig. 5(b) correspond to a
microstructure with anatase phase oriented along the [1 0 0] zone
axis of the Sn-doped anatase TiO2 layer. The reconstructed image
displayed in Fig. 5(c) could be interpreted as a defect-free anatase
TiO2. The least-squares reﬁnement of the d-spacing of the Sn-
doped TiO2 indicated that the dissolution of large-sized Sn cation
caused minor change of the anatase lattice parameters
(a = 3.789 A˚, c = 9.609 A˚, and cell volume = 137.95 A˚3) in compar-
ison with the undoped anatase TiO2 (a = 3.7852 A˚, c = 9.5139 A˚ and
cell volume = 136.31 A˚3 JCPDS ﬁle 21-1272). Fourier transform and
reconstructed image of the amorphous TiO2 layer in the marked
square (II) was displayed in Fig. 5(d) and (e), respectively.
Moreover, Fig. 5(f) and (g) shows the Fourier transform and
reconstructed image of the ﬁrst sITO matrix in the marked square
(III), respectively. The ITO matrix has facet parallel to (2 2 2) as

over an extended period. The formation of the Ti1xSnxO2 layer can
be tailored by, for example, adjusting the position of multi-stacked
sITO thin ﬁlms. As displayed in Table 3, a noticeable expansion of
cell volume of 137.68 A˚3, compared with a typical value of
136.31 A˚3 [2], was obtained for sample mT(6)/sI. This has been
observed for the Ti1xSnxO2 particles with a tin content of about 5-
7 wt.% [25,27]. This indicated that the tin diffusion could substitute
for Ti ions in the TiO2 lattice, forming Ti1xSnxO2 solid solution. The
fact that no segregated SnO2 phase was found at the diffraction
peaks of 278, 348 and 528 also conformed this ﬁnding [27]. The SIMS
depth proﬁles in Fig. 1 also indicated that tin diffused from the sITO
thin ﬁlm into the growing TiO2 ﬁlm. Sample T(6)/sI also exhibited a
slight expansion of cell volume of 137.10 A˚3, as listed in Table 3,
implying a signiﬁcant Sn-doping effect upon the growing TiO2 ﬁlm.
A signiﬁcant increase in both (0 0 4)/(1 0 1) and (2 1 1)/(1 0 1)
intensity ratios of samples T(6)/sI and T(6)/aI may have been
caused by crystal coarsening induced by the synergetic effect of
the ITO substrate and an extended deposition period. Crystal
coarsening, and the consequent growth of large grains, was driven
by a drop in the surface energy under hydrothermal conditions
[38,39]. Therefore, the percentage of reactive {0 0 1} facets
increased, favoring the photoactivity of the TiO2 ﬁlms–in a
manner consistent with the ﬁndings of Deng et al. [18]. This
synergetic effect was not observed either on the glass substrate or
in the carbon-free environment in a relative short period (data not
shown). Restated, the ITO substrate was critical to the formation
of a highly photocatalytic TiO2 ﬁlm under the prescribed
conditions.
It is known that thicker ﬁlms, subjected to longer heat
treatment by repeated heating cycle or extended deposition
duration, have relatively larger anatase crystallites and this causes
the onset of absorption to shift to the red part of the spectrum
[10,40]. Additionally, the porous-structured ﬁlms become highly
light scattering [41,42]. Fig. 8 exhibits the UV–vis absorption
spectra of all the six TiO2 ﬁlms. The variation between simplex
samples, T(3)/aI and T(3)/sI, and other four duplex samples, i.e. T(3/
3)/sI, T(6)/sI, T(6)/aI and mT(6)/sI, in UV–vis absorption spectra
was mainly due to particle growth under extended deposition
period. The visualized evidence for the particle growth of the ﬁlms
under extended deposition duration was obtained from SEM
measurements which are illustrated in Fig. 9. Sample mT(6)/sI
exhibited the least UV–vis absorption among four duplex samples
whose TiO2 thickness was the second largest at 2.8mm, as shown
in Table 1. The blue shift of bandgap energy could happen in
sample mT(6)/sI due to possibly the formation of Ti1xSnxO2 layer
and the rutile phase. Ti1xSnxO2 that exhibited cell volume
expansion has been reported to have a red shift of bandgap
energy of 0.1–0.2 eV [25,27]. This indicated that Sn-doping could
slightly increase the bandgap energy of the TiO2 layer. Conversely,
sample T(3)/sI and T(3)/aI exhibited the same UV–vis absorption
spectra, indicating no thick enough Ti1xSnxO2 layer was formed in
both samples. Note thatmost of the red shift of the bandgap energy
and visible-light absorption of sample T(6)/sI could be ascribed, in
part, to the light scattering effect [42,43]. The light scattering effect
induced by the inherently columnar porous structure (TEM ﬁgure
not shown) of DC magnetron sputtering technique reportedly
beneﬁts the light collection [10,19]. The photocatalytic activity
could be enhanced [42].
Fig. 9 presents SEM surface morphologies of all six samples.
Samples T(3)/sI, T(3)/aI and T(3/3)/sI exhibited similar morpho-
logical patterns with dense, ﬂat surfaces, although T(3/3)/sI had a
slightly rougher surface than the other two, as shown in Fig. 9(a)–
(c), respectively. Both samples T(6)/aI and T(6)/sI had distinct
morphological features with more nanoporous surfaces, as shown
in Fig. 9(d) and (e). The nanoporous surface structures of these
ﬁlms, consistent with the AFM measurements that will be
discussed in the next section, make them potentially effective
catalysts. The multi-stacked mT(6)/sI ﬁlm, presented in Fig. 9(f),
had the most roughest surface of any of the six samples with
symmetrical particles. Typical polygon-shaped rutile TiO2 particles
along with pyramidal particles of the anatase phase on the surface
indicated the effects of sITO thin ﬁlm on the formation of the TiO2
microstructure and, thereby, the PC properties.
Table 3 presents the surface properties of the samples,
estimated from AFM measurements. Samples mT(6)/sI, T(6)/aI
and mT(6)/sI had the highest speciﬁc surface area ratios of about
1.24 and an RMS of 18.5–21.5 nm. Accordingly, these ﬁlms could
absorb more incident photon energy and so exhibited greater PC
activity. Declines in the surface roughness and speciﬁc surface area
ratio were mostly associated with the decrease in the grain size
caused by reducing the deposition period, as evidenced by the fact
that samples T(3)/aI and T(3)/sI had the lowest such values. The
less porous morphology and smaller columnar crystals were
observed in sample T(3/3)/sI because of the formation of an
additional amorphous TiO2 layer or third phase formed when the
second-step deposition resumed.

Ti1xSnxO2 layer formed in both samples. The highest rate constant
of the former was beneﬁcial more from the reactive sites of the
(0 0 1) plane since both samples had nearly the same morpholo-
gical and dimensional properties. Sample T(3/3)/sI had the lowest
k = 0.11 h1 which was reportedly resulted from the fast recombi-
nation of electron–hole pairs in the amorphous TiO2 zone [33].
Sample T(6)/aI had a slightly lower k = 0.18 h1 than sample T(3)/
sI, k = 0.20 h1, although it contained a highly crystalline anatase
TiO2 phase with reactive sites of the (0 0 1) plane. This may have
resulted partially from the formation of the Schottky barrier
without an oxidation–rich Ti1xSnxO2 layer in sample T(6)/aI.
In general, photocatalytic activity is closely related with the
lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes. A Schottky
barrier can form at the TiO2/ITO interface since ITO has a higher
work function than TiO2.The height of the Schottky barrier,Fb, is
related to the work function (Fm) of ITO, which is given by
Fb =Fm  Ex, where Ex is the electron afﬁnity, measured from
the conduction band edge to the vacuum level of TiO2 catalyst
[9]. The work function of Ti1xSnxO2 is presumably a bit higher
than that of the host TiO2 but lower than that of the ITO
substrate, provided that the bandgap energy is slightly increased
due to Sn-doping [25,27]. The Schottky barrier remained
effectively. Thus, the photogenerated electrons could continu-
ously transfer across the TiO2/Ti1xSnxO2/ITO interface to ITO
substrate and thus recombination was effectively suppressed. A
decrease in the electrical conductivity of the Ti1xSnxO2 and ITO
would not affect the PC activity in absence of an applied
potential. However, under an anodic potential, it might have
certain effect on photoelectrocatalytic activity [15]. The further
investigation is needed.
3.5. Photocurrent measurements
In an irradiated TiO2/ITO electrode under an applied potential,
the photogenerated holes are separated from the electrons. Holes
move to the semiconductor surface, where they are trapped or
captured by the reduced species in the electrolyte. And, the
electrons are transported to the high electrical conductivity ITO
substrate where a Schottky barrier can form at the TiO2/ITO
interface. Since this process must overcome the internal resistance
of the electrode, the higher the electrical conductivity the lower is
the photocurrent loss is obtained. A lower sheet resistance
substrate reportedly improves the photocurrent response of
dye-sensitized solar cells [48]. Yu et al. have reported on the
striking increase in photocurrent obtained from a TiO2 electrode
where a conductive TiC interlayer exists between TiO2 and carbon
nanotube. They have attributed the phenomenon to the conductive
TiC which can facilitate electrons transport more freely to an
external circuit and obtain an excess of photogenerated holes in
the TiO2 migrating to the surface [14]. Conversely, a drastic
decrease in photocurrent has reported on the Cr-doped TiO2
electrode due to its lower electrical conductivity [5].
The magnitude of the generated anodic photocurrent upon
irradiation of the electrodes in the PEC cell corresponds to the
charge separation efﬁciency of the electrode. Fig. 10 plots the I–V
characteristics of T(3)/sI, T(6)/aI and T(6)/sI ﬁlm electrodes in 4N
Na2CO3 electrolyte under UV-365 irradiation. The photocurrent
density of sample T(6)/aI increased bilinearly with the applied
potential—more steeply at the negative potential and more slowly
at positive. The ﬁrst fast increase in photocurrent density was
associated with the formation of the Schottky barrier at the TiO2/
aITO interface, because the Schottky barrier enhanced the transfer
of photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 ﬁlm to the aITO
substrate, promoting the generation of photocurrent [9]. Further
increasing the applied potential reduced the driving force of the
separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons by thinning
the space charge layer in sample T(6)/aI. However, the Schottky
barrier may have disappeared because of the formation of a
Ti1xSnxO2 layer at the TiO2/sITO interface of sample T(6)/sI.
Therefore, the photocurrent density of sample T(6)/sI increased
linearly until reaching its plateau of 269mA/cm2 at +0.15 V vs. SCE.
The photocurrent density of sample T(3)/sI increased linearly
throughout the range of applied potentials, but with the lowest
gradient, at least in part because of thinness of the ﬁlm and the
existence of a thin Schottky barrier. A thin ﬁlm of various catalysts
was not sufﬁciently thick to absorb the entire incident light
[45,49,50]. A thin Schottky barrier weakly drives the separation of
the photogenerated holes and electrons. As presented in Table 4,
sample T(6)/sI, with about the same thickness, 2.3 mm, as T(6)/aI,
had the second highest photocurrent density of the six electrodes,
269mA/cm2, but only 56% of that of the T(6)/aI electrode (482 mA/
cm2) at an applied potential of +0.5 V vs. SCE. Electron transport in
sample T(6)/aI was easily facilitated using an aITO thin ﬁlm in
which no tin diffusion was expected.
A rather poor photocurrent response and the low density in
sample T(6)/sI may have resulted from the Ti1xSnxO2 layer, in
which a decline in the electrical conductivity for x < 0.1 has been
reported upon [51]. More importantly, the resistivity can be
increased by a factor of eight by reducing the Sn content in the sITO
thin ﬁlm [52]. High electrical conductivity facilitates the separa-
tion of photogenerated electrons and holes, preserving the
photocurrents of the electrodes [53,54]. Therefore, the increase
in electrical resistance can adversely affect the photogenerated
electrons in the PEC cell, reducing the photocurrent, because a PEC
electrode should be barrier free, enabling electrons to be transport
rapidly without loss of energy. The photocurrent densities of
samples T(3/3)/sI and T(3)/sI were the lowest, perhaps in part

introduction of N species by setting the process conditions has been
experimentally demonstrated to be critical to the optimization of photo-
catalytic performance [8,12].
Among various semiconductor oxides, ITO is an importantmaterial
that has been extensively used in various applications [10,13,14]. ITO,
an n-type semiconductor, exhibits excellent electrical conductivity
and stability in aqueous solution, but its use in splitting water is
excluded by its large bandgap ~3.8 eV. Functionally analogous to N-
doped TiO2 or In2O3, the photocatalyst formed by doping ITO with N
ions is potentially versatile in sputtering because of material avail-
ability and process controllability [13,15].
In this work, ITO ﬁlms were doped with nitrogen, N-ITO, in an
argon/oxygen gas mixture by direct current sputtering. N-ITO ﬁlms
were prepared as alternative visible-light photocatalysts for splitting
water to produce hydrogen.
2. Experimental procedure
N-ITO ﬁlms were deposited on unheated ITO glass substrates using
two ITO targets in a closed-ﬁeld unbalanced magnetron sputtering
system (MIRDC, Taiwan). The ITO glass substrate had a resistivity of
1.9×10−6Ω m. All other parameters were held constant while the O2
and N2 gas proportionswere varied from 14.5% to 20.0% in an Ar/O2/N2
gasmixture,whichhad a totalﬂow rate of 55 sccm. All N-ITOﬁlms had a
thickness between the ranges of 900–1250 nm, as shown in Table 1.
Undoped ITO and TiO2 ﬁlms, of thicknesses 180 and 1800 nm,
respectively, were used for comparison. The samples were denoted as
Ni-ITO, with i=1–4. No post treatment of the samples was performed.
The crystalline structures of the samples were analyzed using a high
resolution X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku ATX-E) and Micro-PL/
Raman spectroscope (Jobin-Yvon T64000). The microstructure of the
ﬁlms was investigated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL
JSM-6700F). The bandgap energy was estimated from the optical
transmittance and reﬂectance coefﬁcients of the samples using the
built-in proprietary algorithms in an n & k analyzer (n & k Analyzer
1280) [16]. The resistivity of the sampleswasobtainedby using the four-
point probe method, details of which were reported elsewhere [15].
The standard photoelectrochemical three-cell system included a
sample ﬁlm anode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference
electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode in 4.0 N Na2CO3 solution
(pH~11) which was controlled using a potentiostat (CHI 610C). A
working area of 20×50 mm2 of the sample ﬁlm was exposed to the
Na2CO3 solution. The electrolyte was purged using N2 gas to remove the
dissolved oxygen before each photocurrent experiment was carried. All
the experiments were performed at 22–25 °C under laboratory condi-
tions. Two types of sources, UV lamps (UV365, λ=365 nm) and blue-
light-emitting diodes (BLED, 420<λ<530 nm), were chosen to provide
irradiated light intensities of 2.7 and 12.5 mW/cm2, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructural properties
As presented in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of all the Ni-ITO ﬁlms were
mostly characteristic of the polycrystalline cubic bixbyite In2O3 phase,
but a weak pattern was observed in the N1-ITO ﬁlm. The surface
morphology of the thin ﬁlm is known to be governed by the nature of
the substrate [17]. Therefore, the conducting ITO substrate enhanced
the crystallinity of the growing Ni-ITO ﬁlms without additional
substrate heating in this work. The Ni-ITO samples revealed an In2O3
cubic phase with preferential peaks of (222), (400) and (440) shifted
to lower diffraction angles, but the N1-ITO ﬁlm revealed the most
shifted angle from a typical 2θ=30.65° to 30.10° of the (222) In2O3
peak. It is known that the lattice parameters of ITO ﬁlms are typically
inﬂuenced by any increase of internal or thermal stress, interstitial
lattice defects, or the incorporation of argon or tin atoms in the In2O3
lattice. The XRD diffraction peaks shifted downwards was due to, in
part, the low deposition temperature as well as the Sn- and N-doping
[18,19]. N1-ITO ﬁlms that were prepared in 20% N2 yielded a broader
XRD peak at 2θ=33–34°. This peak was probably related to the
substitution of nitrogen since the peak intensity decreased with the
N-concentration. Additionally, a very weak peak at about 2θ=31.6°
was detected. Thus, these two peaks fromN1-ITO ﬁlmwere intuitively
assigned to the (101) and (002) planes of the InN phase. Analogous to
the formation of the heterogeneous titanium nitride phase, which
always detrimentally affected the photocatalytic activity of N-doped
TiO2 prepared at a high N2 concentration, the heterogeneous phase,
InN, possibly formed within the ITO lattice. On the other hand, the
peaks related to InN phases were undetectable in samples N3- and
N4-ITO. This possibility was demonstrated by Raman and optical
measurements in the following sections.
While XRD patterns reveal the general crystal properties in the
ﬁlm, Raman spectra are very sensitive to local crystallinity and
microstructures near the ﬁlm surface. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra
of the Ni-ITO ﬁlms grown with different N2 ratios, where the
sputtered ITO ﬁlm was presented for comparison. There were two
additional broad peaks on the Raman spectra of the N1-ITO ﬁlms
centered at about 240 and 490 cm−1, respectively, as compared with
the sputtered ITO ﬁlm. The former was an unspeciﬁed peak observed
in all four Ni-ITO ﬁlms, but neither the pure ITO nor the In2O3 ﬁlms
