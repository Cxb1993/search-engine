high computing power [8].  For example, Liao et. 
al. [8] showed a simple image secure 
communication scheme based on the chaotic 
Chebyshev map and chaos synchronization.  A 
discrete-time chaotic Chebyshev sequence which 
is different from a random binary one is employed 
for digital image encryptions.  Simulation results 
reveal that the transmitted source image can be 
correctly recovered by the proposed method.  In 
[9], the authors proposed a novel chaotic system 
where variables are treated as encryption keys to 
achieve secure transmission of digital color images 
by means of computer internet communications.  
If the encrypted image signals are caught in the 
communication channel, the source images are 
still not able to be decrypted because of the lack 
of adequate encryption keys.  Based on the 
utilization of the chaotic theory, Chen and Leung 
[10] presented a novel technique for image 
watermarking.  In this work, chaotic parameter 
modulation is employed to modulate the copyright 
information into the bifurcating parameter of a 
chaotic system.  In the detection, a novel method 
using the ergodic property of chaotic signal is 
developed to demodulate the embedded copyright 
information.  Furthermore, the authors in [11] 
proposed a novel chaos-based image technique.  
The proposed schemes have a good range-
Doppler resolution and excellent side lobe 
suppression characteristics that promise immense 
potential for high-resolution imaging application.  
Simulation results for through-the-wall radar 
imaging are demonstrated to verify the efficiency 
of the proposed method.   
In this project, we present another novel chaos-
based digital image communication. In the 
proposed scheme, the binary source image codes 
are first changed to be a continuous modulation 
signal using the modulator.  This modulated signal 
is taken as a parameter of a unified chaotic system 
and further transmitted by means of three chaotic 
state variables to the receiver terminal through a 
noisy channel.  In the chaotic receiver, an 
adequate adaptation law for decrypting the 
received state variables is proposed to obtain the 
original modulated continuous signal.  Finally, a 
simple demodulation formula is used to recover 
the modulated signal as the binary source image 
codes.  The rest of this project is organized as 
follows.  A complete problem formulation for a 
unified chaotic system is described in Section 2.  
In Section 3, we investigate in detail the digital 
image secure communication based on the unified 
chaotic system.  In Section 4, some numerical 
simulations are made to verify the validity of the 
proposed method.  A brief conclusion is finally 
addressed in Section 5.   
 
II.  UNIFIED CHAOTIC SYSTEM 
A unified chaotic system with three state 
differential equations in an autonomous form is 
given by [2][15] 
( )( )xysx −+= 1025& ,  (1a) 
( ) ( )ysxzxsy 1293528 −+−−=& ,  (1b) 
( )zsxyz 8
3
1
+−=& , (1c) 
where x, y, and z are the state variables of the 
chaotic system, and [ ]10,s ∈  is a chaotic 
parameter.  It should be noted that for such a 
unified chaotic system different values of s will 
result in different chaotic behaviors.  For example, 
the system (1) is the Lorenz system for 
)8.0,0[∈s , however, it belongs to the Lü system 
and Chen’s system for 8.0=s  and ]1,8.0(∈s , 
respectively.  As a result, the chaotic behavior still 
holds when parameter s varies within the interval 
[ ]1,0 .   
 
Unified Chaotic Transmitter and Receiver  
 In this project, the unified chaotic system of (1) 
is taken as a chaotic transmitter and the useful 
information is placed on the chaotic parameter s.  
Only three chaotic state signals x, y, and z are 
delivered through the public channel where noises 
are added.  The security can be guaranteed 
because it is hard to decrypt these three state 
signals to the useful information s without a 
decryption key (adaptation law).  
In the receiver terminal, the following 
decryption adaptation laws are adopted to recover 
the original information s [2]

where r is a positive constant and sˆ  is the 
recovered information for s.

where ( )NTktkNT 1+<≤ , for L,2,1,0=k , 
and T is a modulation period of carrier.  This 
carrier is then secretly delivered via three unified 
chaotic states.   
 
B.  Modified Unified Chaotic Transmitter and 
Receiver 
Some explanations for the chaotic transmitter and 
receiver have been investigated in Section 2.  
Nevertheless, it is undoubted that a carrier signal 
passing a public channel may be affected by 
channel noises ( )tw .  In the receiver terminal, the 
received chaotic signals indeed are states of ( )txˆ , 
( )tyˆ , and ( )tzˆ .  As a result, the following 
modified adaptation laws instead of (2) is 
proposed for decrypting s

C.  Demodulation 
After a decrypted signal ( )tsˆ  is obtained by the 
proposed adaptation law (8), some demodulation 
mechanism is performed to recover the source 
digital image.  Let ( ) t

reference carrier signal.  If the error between the 
reference signal ( )tc  and decrypted signal ( )tsˆ  
relatively approximates to zero, it means that 
( ) 1ˆ =kb ; conversely, if the error approximates to 
t
T
pi2
cos , then ( ) 0ˆ =kb .  Therefore, we adopt the 
following demodulation mechanism to recover the 
digital image information

IV.  A LENA DIGITAL IMAGE 
SIMULATION 
To verify the correction of the proposed 
method, we illustrate the digital image secure 
communication with a 128128×  Lena bitmap 
image.  The first binary sequence for the digital 
Lena image is listed as follows 
( ) { }L10110000111100001=kb .   
In the following simulations, the software of 
Borland C++ is used to program the above 
numerical algorithms.  The sampling time is set to 
be 0.001 for simulating the differential equations 
of unified chaotic system, and initial chaotic states 
are given by ( ) ( ) ( ) 1000 === zyx .  In addition, 
the related variables used in a carrier signal (7) are 
chosen as pi=T  and 1=N  for simplification, and 
the constant r in the adaptation laws (8a) and (8b) 
is given by 10.  Some simulation results are shown 
in Figs. 2-4.  The trajectories of three chaotic 
states of ( )tx , ( )ty , and ( )tz  are shown in Fig. 2 
during image communications.  It is obvious from 
Fig. 2 that the dynamics with three different kind 
of chaos always holds, and accordingly the useful 
information s is difficult to be decrypted from the 
signals ( )tx , ( )ty , and ( )tz  without an adequate 
decryption key.  Figs. 3 and 4 display comparisons 
between the useful signal ( )ts  and decrypted 
signal ( )tsˆ  without and with channel noises, 
respectively.  Finally, Figs. 5(a)(b)(c) then exhibit 
the source Lena image and the recovered ones 
without and with channel noises, respectively.  
Both recovered digital binary sequences are the 
same as the original, i.e.,  
 ( ) { }L10110000111100001ˆ =kb .   
From these simulation results, one can be easily
