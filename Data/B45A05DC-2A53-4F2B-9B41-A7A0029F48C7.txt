the CRLH CPW short-circuited and open-circuited stubs are also 
presented.  
stub is also incorporated into Fig. 1(c) due to the established 
equivalent circuit similar to Fig. 1(b). Notably, the stub 
lengths of the CRLH short-circuited and open-circuited 
structures are 51.4% and 65.67% more compact than those 
of the conventional ones, respectively. 
III. CHARACTERISTICS OF EBG CPW STUBS 
The equivalent circuit of the composite right/left-handed 
CPW short-circuited stub shown in Fig. 1(a) is established 
by using the effective medium concept [2], and the input 
admittance (Fig. 1(b)) can thus be determined by

which is due to the parasitic elements of the DPBRs beyond 
the frequencies of interest. 
The physical dimensions of the DPBF are presented in 
Fig. 4(b). Moreover, Fig. 5 depicts the dual-passband 
response of DPBF, which shows a good agreement among 
the full-wave simulated, equivalent-circuit modelled, and 
measured results. The measured operating frequencies are 
observed as  GHz,  GHz, L1 3.17f = H1 3.45f = L2 4.04f =  
GHz, and  GHz. Additionally, the area of the 
DPBF is 46% smaller than that of [Fig. 9(a), 3]. The 
measured insertion losses at the in-band central frequencies, 
i.e., 3.3 GHz and 4.3 GHz, are better than 2.3 dB and 1.5 dB, 
respectively. The additional pole located at 5.2 GHz is 
caused by the infinite input susceptance of the DPBRs. 
Notably, the measured result is shifted to lower frequency, 
which may due to the manufacturing tolerance in physical 
dimensions and bound wires.

V. CONCLUSION 
The CRLH open-circuited stub and the EBG short-
circuited stub have been studied by full-wave simulation, 
equivalent-circuit model, and measurement. The CRLH and 
EBG CPW short-circuited and open-circuited stubs have the 
same reflection characteristics as the conventional half-
wavelength and quarter-wavelength short-circuited and 
open-circuited stubs, respectively. These results demonstrate 
that the advantage of size reduction of the CRLH and EBG 
CPWs can be obtained. Furthermore, the combination of the 
CRLH open-circuited and Type-I CPW stubs is successfully 
used to implement the DPBF. The proposed DPBF has the 
advantages of compact size, the eliminated DC signal, and a 
deep rejection between two passbands. Some potential 
applications of the proposed stubs, such as the multiple 
passband filters, are currently under investigation.
