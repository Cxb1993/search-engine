Abstract
The sum-rate capacity of a noncoherent multiple-access Rician fading chan-
nel is investigated under three different categories of power constraints: in-
dividual per user peak-power constraints, individual per user average-power
constraints, or a global power-sharing average-power constraint. Upper and
lower bounds on the sum-rate capacity are derived and it is shown that at high
signal-to-noise ratio the sum-rate capacity only grows double-logarithmically in
the available power. The asymptotic behavior of capacity is then analyzed in
detail and the exact asymptotic expansion is derived including its second term,
the so called fading number. It is shown that the fading number is identical
to the fading number of the single-user Rician fading channel that is obtained
when only the user seeing the best channel is transmitting and all other users
are switched off at all times. This pessimistic result holds independently of the
type of power constraint that is imposed.

1 Introduction
In a noncoherent fading channel where neither transmitter nor receiver know the
fading realization, it has been shown in [1] that the capacity at high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) behaves fundamentally different from the usual asymptotics seen in
Gaussian channels or in coherent fading channels: instead of a logarithmic growth
in the SNR, the capacity only grows double-logarithmically. To be precise, if the
fading process is stationary, ergodic, and has a finite differential entropy rate and a
finite expected second moment, then we have
C(snr) = log(1 + log(1 + snr)) + χ+ o(1) (1)
where o(1) denotes terms that tend to zero as the SNR tends to infinity; and where
χ is a constant independent of the SNR that is called fading number. The value
of χ depends on the exact specifications of the fading law. In the situation of a
general memoryless fading process, i.e., a fading process that is independent and
identically distributed (IID) over time and of a general law, the fading number has
been derived for a single-input single-output (SISO) channel, a single-input multiple-
output (SIMO) channel, and a multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel in [1],
and the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel was solved in [2]. The more
general setup of a stationary, ergodic and regular fading process has been analyzed
in [1] for the SISO case, [3] solved the SIMO case, and the most general MIMO case
was addressed in [4].
Note that even though the fading number is defined only in the limit when the
available SNR tends to infinity, it has practical relevance also for finite SNR: it
is a good estimator for the threshold where the capacity changes from the normal
logarithmic growth to the highly inefficient double-logarithmic growth. For more
details we refer to the discussion in Section 3.3 and to the introduction section in
[4].
All the above mentioned results are restricted to the situation of a single trans-
mitter (possibly with several antennas) and a single receiver. The present work is
a first step towards generalizing the setup to a multiple-user situation. Concretely,
we include m transmitters, each having a certain number ni of antennas and trying
to communicate to a common receiver with only one antenna. The fading law is
assumed to be memoryless both over time and space and Gaussian distributed with
line-of-sight (LOS) components. We will propose upper and lower bounds on the
sum-rate capacity of this channel and derive the exact asymptotic expansion of the
sum-rate capacity for the SNR tending to infinity. It will turn out that the asymp-
totic capacity corresponds to the single-user capacity for the case when all but one
user are switched off at all times.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. After some short remarks
about notation we will introduce the multiple-access (MAC) Rician fading channel
and three different power constraints in Section 2. In Section 3 we will derive upper
and lower bounds on the sum-rate capacity of this model that are valid for all SNR.
These bounds are based on new bounds for the single-user MISO Rician fading
channel. We will see there that in contrast to the low-SNR regime, at high SNR the
capacity only grows double-logarithmically in the power.
To investigate the threshold between these two regimes, in Sections 4 and 5 the
asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate capacity will be analyzed and stated exactly.
The proof of the main result can be found in Section 6, while the derivations of some
intermediate steps have been moved to the appendix. We conclude in Section 7.
3
and Z ∼ NC
(
0, σ2
)
denotes additive, zero-mean, circularly symmetric Gaussian
noise, independent from the fading (H1, . . . ,Hm).
We assume a noncoherent situation, i.e., neither transmitters nor receiver have
knowledge of the current fading realization, they only know the fading distributions.1
Note that we do not restrict the receiver and/or transmitters to try to gain such
knowledge. Any power or bandwidth used for such estimation schemes, however,
are taken into account for the capacity analysis and are not given for free as in a
coherent setup. Neither will it be possible for the receiver to gain perfect channel
knowledge.
We do not allow cooperation between the users, i.e., we assume that the input
vectors of the different users are statistically independent:
Xi ⊥Xj , i 6= j. (7)
For completeness we also mention that the users’ input vectors are assumed to be
independent from fading and noise.
For simplicity of notation we will sometimes collect all LOS vectors di into one
nT-vector d:
d , (dT1, . . . ,d
T
m)
T (8)
the fading vectors Hi into one fading vector H of length nT:
H , (HT1, . . . ,H
T
m)
T (9)
and the input vectors Xi of all users into one nT-vector X:
X , (XT1, . . . ,X
T
m)
T. (10)
In the given setup we can consider several possible constraints on the power. We
will analyze three different scenarios:
• Peak-Power Constraint: At every time-step every user i is allowed to use
a power of at most κimE :
Pr
[
‖Xi‖2 > κi
m
E
]
= 0 (11)
for some fixed number κi > 0.
• Average-Power Constraint: Averaged over the length of a codeword, every
user i is allowed to use a power of at most κimE :
E
[‖Xi‖2] ≤ κi
m
E (12)
for some fixed number κi > 0.
• Power-Sharing Average-Power Constraint: Averaged over the length of
a codeword all users together are allowed to use a power of at most κ¯E :
E
[
m∑
i=1
‖Xi‖2
]
≤ κ¯E (13)
for some fixed number κ¯ > 0.
1Note that the constant LOS vectors di are part of the distributions and are therefore known
everywhere!

= CMISO,av,nT(κ¯E). (19)
Here CMISO,av,nT(Υ) denotes the (single-user) capacity of the MISO Rician fading
channel with nT transmitter antennas (and one receiver antenna)
Y = dTx+HTx+ Z (20)
(where d, H, and x are defined in (8), (9), and (10), respectively) under the average-
power constraint
E
[‖X‖2] ≤ Υ. (21)
On the other hand, obviously the sum rate cannot be smaller than the single-user
rate that can be achieved if all but one user are switched off, assuming the most
stringent type of power constraint (11), and assuming the minimal amount of power
among all users. I.e., for an arbitrary i ∈ {1, . . . ,m},
CMAC(E) = sup

Here, CMISO,pp,ni(Υ) denotes the (single-user) capacity of the MISO Rician fading
channel with ni transmitter antennas (and one receiver antenna)

under the peak-power constraint
Pr
[‖Xi‖2 > Υ] = 0 (27)
and we define
κmin , min

κi. (28)
Hence, we have the following first important result.
Theorem 1. The sum-rate capacity (15) of the multiple-access Rician fading chan-
nel (3) under one of the three power constraints (11), (12), or (13) is bounded as
follows:

3.2 Bounds on MISO Rician Fading Channel
In order to be able derive more explicit bounds on the MAC sum-rate capacity, we
make a small detour and develop some bounds on the MISO Rician fading channel.
We start with an upper bound, which is a generalization of a bound from [1], based
on a dual expression of mutual information.

noise channel with equivalent received SNR. The red horizontal line corresponds
to the fading number χ as derived in Section 5, and the dashed red line is the
approximate threshold χ + 2 nats between the efficient low-SNR and the highly
inefficient high-SNR behavior.
3.3 Discussion
Proposition 2 and 3 can be applied directly to Theorem 1 to get bounds on the
sum-rate capacity. Figure 1 depicts an example with two users m = 2, each of them
having the same power constraint, i.e., κ1 = κ2 = κ¯ = 1. The LOS components are
assumed to be ‖d1‖ = 6 and ‖d2‖ = 8, such that ‖d‖ = 10. Note that the exact
choice of the vectors d1 and d2 including their dimensions n1 and n2 is irrelevant
for the given bounds. The LOS components influence the expressions only via their
magnitudes.
We clearly see that there exist two distinct regimes: for SNR values below around
10 dB (or a rate of about CMAC ≈ 5 nats) the sum-rate capacity grows logarithmi-
cally in the SNR, while above the threshold the growth changes dramatically and
becomes very slowly growing. We will show in the next section that this high-SNR
growth is double-logarithmic.
We conclude that one should not use this channel at high SNR, and we ask for
more insight about this threshold between the efficient low-SNR regime and the
highly inefficient high-SNR regime. As described in [4, Sec. I.B] it turns out that an
asymptotic capacity analysis is the clue to such an investigation. This might seem
strange at first sight as we just have concluded that we are not interested in this
channel at high SNR. However, it is important to realize that around the threshold,
the sum-rate capacity is dominated by the second (constant) term of the asymptotic
9
A priori χMAC depends on the type of power constraint (11), (12), or (13) that
is imposed on the input. However, it will turn out that the value of the MAC fading
number is identical for all three cases. We therefore take the liberty to use a slightly
sloppy notation that does not specify the used power constraint.
From (29), (38), and (40) we realize that
max
i
χMISO,di ≤ χMAC ≤ χMISO,d (43)
or explicitly (by (39))
max
i
{
log
(‖di‖2)− Ei (−‖di‖2)− 1} ≤ χMAC ≤ log (‖d‖2)− Ei (−‖d‖2)− 1 (44)
where we remind the reader that di is the LOS vector of user i and d , (d
T
1, . . . ,d
T
m)
T
is the stacked LOS vector of all users.
Using the monotonicity of ξ 7→ log(ξ)−Ei(−ξ)−1 we now define dMAC ≥ 0 such
that
χMAC = log
(
d2MAC
)− Ei (−d2MAC)− 1. (45)
From (44) we know that
max
{‖d1‖2, . . . , ‖dm‖2} ≤ d2MAC ≤ ‖d‖2 = ‖d1‖2 + · · ·+ ‖dm‖2. (46)
In the remainder we will derive the exact value of dMAC.
We would like to point out that in [5] it has been proven that for the two-user
case m = 2 with n1 = n2 = 1 (and with κ1 = κ2 = 1) the upper bound in (46)
cannot be achieved, i.e.,
d2MAC < ‖d‖2 (47)
with strict inequality.
5 Main Result: The MAC Fading Number
Theorem 6. Consider a multiple-access Rician fading channel as defined in (3).
Then, irrespective of which power constraint (11), (12), or (13) is imposed on the
input and irrespective of the values of κ1, . . . , κm, the MAC fading number χMAC
(42) is given by
χMAC = log
(
d2MAC
)− Ei (−d2MAC)− 1 (48)
with
d2MAC , max
{‖d1‖2, . . . , ‖dm‖2} . (49)
This shows that the lower bound in (46) is tight, which is a rather pessimistic
result. It means that if the magnitude of the LOS vector of one user is strictly larger
than the LOS vectors of the other users, then the asymptotic sum-rate capacity can
only be achieved if all but this strongest user are switched off at all times. If there are
several users with LOS vectors of identical largest magnitude, the sum-rate capacity
can also be achieved by time sharing among those best users.
Note that the result holds even if we allow for power sharing among the users.
11
Proof. See Appendix D.
Noting that ξ 7→ log(ξ)−Ei (−ξ)− 1 is a monotonically increasing function and
using our definition of dMAC in (45) we hence conclude that
d2MAC ≤ lim
E↑∞

[ |dTX|2

. (54)
We would like to point out that without the constraint (51) the right-hand side
(RHS) of (54) actually equals to ‖d‖2, i.e., to the RHS of (46), from which we
already know that it is (at least in some cases) strictly loose. So we see that the
presented generalization of the concept of input distributions that escape to infinity
(Proposition 7) is crucial to this proof.
We now continue as follows:

where in (56) we split the supremum into many separate suprema, and where (57)
follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
|dTiXi|2 ≤ ‖di‖2‖Xi‖2. (58)
We next upper-bound the first term in (57) as follows:

where we have defined the vector r , (r1, . . . , rm)
T and the matrix
D˜ , diag
(‖d1‖2, . . . , ‖dm‖2) . (63)
The equality (61) follows from the Rayleigh-Ritz Theorem [6, Theorem 4.2.2].
To address the remaining terms in (57) we note that by definition of A in (52)
at least one user’s input must escape to infinity. Without loss of generality assume
13
property that the supremum of a sum is always upper-bounded by the sum of the
suprema.
Next, let’s look at the first term in (74) and use (70):

Here, (75) follows from (70); the subsequent inequality (76) follows by taking the
supremum into the first integral which can only enlarge the expression; in (77) we
exchange limit and integration which needs justification: define
gE1(xi) , sup

and then note that ∫
gupper(xi) dQXi(xi) =

dQXi(xi) =

(83)
i.e., gupper(·) is independent of E1 and integrable. Thus, by the Dominated Conver-
gence Theorem [7] we are allowed to swap limit and integration.
Finally, (79) follows from Proposition 7 because QX1 escapes to infinity.

7 Conclusions
In this paper we have derived a new upper and lower bound on the sum-rate ca-
pacity of a noncoherent memoryless multiple-access Rician fading channel with m
transmitters (with a different number of antennas each) and one receiver (with only
one antenna). We have shown that while the sum-rate capacity at low SNR behaves
normally with a logarithmic growth in the available power, at high SNR it is highly
power-inefficient and only grows double-logarithmically. It is therefore advisable not
to operate such a channel at high SNR. These bounds rely on novel bounds on the
capacity of a single-user MISO Rician fading channel that are valid for any SNR.
In a second step we then derived the exact asymptotic high-SNR expansion of
the sum-rate capacity, which has the form
CMAC = log log
( E
σ2
)
+ χMAC + o(1). (101)
We have shown that this asymptotic sum-rate capacity is limited by the asymptotic
capacity of the user seeing the best channel and can only be achieved if all users
with a channel that is strictly worse than the best channel are always switched off
and cannot communicate. Note that this should not be confused with the idea of
time sharing where at any given time only one user is allowed to communicate. In
the presented setup, as long as the channel model does not change, the best user
will remain the best user, i.e., all other users can never communicate.3 This very
pessimistic result fits to the already rather pessimistic double-logarithmic behavior
and strengthen the conviction that these channels should not be used at high SNR,
but only at low SNR where the channel will behave normally like a coherent fading
channel.
At first sight our results seems very similar to a result by Knopp and Humblet
[8] [9] [10], who showed that the strategy of one user at a time also is optimal for
the MAC with full channel state information both at the transmitter and receiver
side. In [8] a continuous-time system is considered and it is shown that if the
transmitter and receiver have full knowledge of the fading, then it is best if the
3The only exception is if there are several users having the same best channel. In this case these
equivalent best users can use time sharing to alternatively communicate.
17
stated this concept here specifically for the multiple-access Rician fading channel at
hand, it can be further extended to more general multiple-user channels.
A Upper Bound on MISO Rician Fading Capacity
The upper bound (30) on the MISO Rician fading channel (20) is a generalization
of an upper bound on the SISO Rician fading channel presented in [1, Eq. (166)]. It
is based on a duality-based upper bound on the mutual information taken from [1,
Eq. (25)]:
I(X;Y ) ≤ −h(Y |X) + log pi + α log β + log Γ
(
α,
ν
β
)
+ (1− α)E[log (|Y |2 + ν)]+ 1
β
E
[|Y |2]+ ν
β
(102)
where α, β > 0 and ν ≥ 0 are free parameters.
We start with an upper bound on the fifth term on the RHS of (102). To that
goal we assume 0 < α < 1 such that 1− α > 0 and define
ν , sup
x
{
E
[
log
(|Y |2 + ν) ∣∣ X = x]− E[ log |Y |2 ∣∣ X = x] } (103)
such that
(1− α)E[log (|Y |2 + ν)]
= (1− α)E[log |Y |2]+ (1− α) (E[log (|Y |2 + ν)]− E[log |Y |2]) (104)
≤ (1− α)E[log |Y |2]
+ (1− α) sup

{

= (1− α)E[log |Y |2]+ (1− α)ν . (106)
Next we apply (102) to the MISO Rician fading channel (20). We note that

Here, in (110) we evaluate the expected logarithm of a noncentral chi-square random
variable as derived in [11], [1, Lemma 10.1], [12, Lemma A.6]; and (112) follows
19
where Φ and R are statistically independent, Φ is uniform between 0 and 2pi, Φ ∼
U([0, 2pi)), and R is such that
logR2 ∼ U([logΥ0, logΥ]) (120)
for some fixed Υ0. This choice satisfies the peak-power constraint (27) and also
Pr
[‖Xi‖2 ≥ Υ0] = 1. (121)
Hence by Lemma 10, we get
CMISO,pp,ni(Υ) ≥ I(Xi;dTiXi +HTiXi + Z) (122)
≥ I(Xi;dTiXi +HTiXi)
− sup
‖xˆ‖=1
{
h
(
dTi xˆ+H
T
i xˆ+
Z√
Υ0
)
− h(dTi xˆ+HTi xˆ)
}
(123)
= I(Xi;d
T
iXi +H
T
iXi)− log
(
1 +
σ2
Υ0
)
. (124)
We introduce a random variable
H˜ , HTi ·
di
‖di‖e
iΦ ∼ NC(0, 1) (125)
and rewrite the first term on the RHS of (124) as follows:
I(Xi;d
T
iXi +H
T
iXi)
= h(dTiXi +H
T
iXi)− h(dTiXi +HTiXi|Xi) (126)
= h(‖di‖eiΦR+ H˜R)− E
[
log
(
pie‖Xi‖2
)]
(127)
= h
(∣∣‖di‖eiΦR+ H˜R∣∣2)− 1− E[logR2] (128)
≥ h
(
R2 · ∣∣‖di‖eiΦ + H˜∣∣2 ∣∣∣Φ, H˜)− 1− E[logR2] (129)
= h
(
R2
)
+ E
[
log
∣∣‖di‖eiΦ + H˜∣∣2]− 1− E[logR2] . (130)
Here, (128) follows from the fact that for a circularly symmetric random variable U
we have [1, Lemma 6.16]
h(U) = h
(|U |2)+ log pi. (131)
In (129) we condition the differential entropy which cannot increase its value; and
(130) follows from the scaling property of differential entropy [13, Th. 8.6.4].
Next, we again evaluate the expected logarithm of a noncentral chi-square ran-
dom variable [11], [1, Lemma 10.1], [12, Lemma A.6]:
E
[
log
(∣∣‖di‖eiΦ + H˜∣∣2)] = E[log (∣∣‖di‖+ H˜∣∣2)] (132)
= log
(‖di‖2)− Ei (−‖di‖2) (133)
(where the first equality follows because H˜ is circularly symmetric) and use the
following identity [1, Lemma 6.15]:
h
(
logR2
)
= h
(
R2
)− E[logR2] . (134)
The lower bound (34) now follows by plugging (130), (133), and (134) into (124)
and noting that because of (120)
h
(
logR2
)
= log log
(
Υ
Υ0
)
. (135)
21
we can upper-bound the MAC situation by full-cooperation MISO:
I(X1, . . . ,Xm;Y |U = 0) ≤ CMISO,av,nT(E0). (152)
Moreover, by total expectation,
E
[
m∑
i=1
‖Xi‖2
]
= µE
[
m∑
i=1
‖Xi‖2
∣∣∣∣∣ U = 1
]
+ (1− µ)E
[
m∑
i=1
‖Xi‖2
∣∣∣∣∣ U = 0
]
︸ ︷︷ ︸
≥0
(153)
≥ µE
[
m∑
i=1
‖Xi‖2
∣∣∣∣∣ U = 1
]
(154)
from which follows that
E
[
m∑
i=1
‖Xi‖2
∣∣∣∣∣ U = 1
]
≤ E
[∑m
i=1 ‖Xi‖2
]
µ
≤ E
µ
(155)
and hence, again allowing full-cooperation,
I(X1, . . . ,Xm;Y |U = 1) ≤ CMISO,av,nT
(E
µ
)
. (156)
Next, let En be a sequence with En ↑ ∞, let {QEn}n be a family of joint input
distributions for the multiple-access Rician fading channel (3) such that
lim
n↑∞
I(QEn)
log log En = 1 (157)
and define
µn , QEn
({
‖X1‖2 ≥ E0
m
}
∪ · · · ∪
{
‖Xm‖2 ≥ E0
m
})
.
(158)
By contradiction, assume µn → µ∗ < 1. Then there must exist some µ0 < 1 such
that
µn < µ0, n sufficiently large. (159)
From (150) we have
I(QEn)
log log En︸ ︷︷ ︸
→1
≤ log 2 + CMISO,av,nT(E0)
log log En︸ ︷︷ ︸
→0
+
CMISO,av,nT

(
En
µn
)
︸ ︷︷ ︸
→1
·
µn log log
(
En
µn
)
log log En . (160)
Here the limiting behavior of the left-hand side (LHS) follows from (157); the limiting
behavior of the first term on the RHS is because CMISO,av,nT(E0) < ∞; the second
term on the RHS tends to one because En ↑ ∞ implies En/µn ↑ ∞ and because of
(38). Hence, when n ↑ ∞ we obtain
1 ≤ lim
n↑∞
µn log log
(
En
µn
)
log log En (161)

(Compare with [1, Appendix VII], [12, Sec. B.5.9].)
Hence, using the definition of the MAC fading number (42) and the definition of
the sum-rate capacity (15), we have derived the following upper bound on the MAC
fading number:
χMAC = lim
E↑∞
{
CMAC(E)− log

}
+ ν + ν + log

1− e−ν)− log ν. (179)
Here, in (177) we make use of Proposition 7; (178) follows from (168); and the last
equality is due to (171)–(174).
By letting ν tend to zero which makes sure that ν → 0 (as can be seen from
(103) and (113)) the claim follows.

會議 
名稱 
 (中文) 2010 年，國際消息理論會議 
 (英文) 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2010)
發表 
論文 
題目 
 (中文)  
 (英文)  
報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
這個 ISIT 會議主要是由做 information theory, I.T. (消息理論) 以及 coding theory (編
碼理論)的研究人員所合辦的國際型 A 級會議，這兩個領域都是通訊電信領域中較理論的領域，
也是相當重要的理論基礎，因為我們實驗室做消息理論相關的。 
第一天到了會議會場，早上就只有等著領東西與包包而已，下午看了有些演講與我做的東西
並沒有與我學過以及與研究相關的東西相關就沒有前去聽了。 
第二天早上八點到會場，聽了一場 Plenary Session，演講者叫 Michale Jordan，演講的主
題是 Completely Random Measures for Bayesian Nonparametrices，這個主題算是比較新的東
西，也沒有與我做的研究有所相關。但就如來過 ISIT 會議的學長說過的一樣，這種的 talk 通常
都學不到東西，因為這種演講都很多人，而且還要考驗演講者的演說實力，如果一次講太多的話，
反而會讓人不易吸收，真的學不到什麼新的東西，所以也吸收得不多。接下來就有正常的一場一
場可以由自己選擇的小型演講，第一場我聽的演講是 Interference Channels session 中的 Sum 
Capacity of General Deterministic Interference Channel with Channel Output Feedback，
這一場 talk 曾經得過 Shannon Award (在我們 information theory 的領域中算是最知名的獎項)
的得主，同時在 information theory 界中有頗有名的 Mr. S. Verdu 也有來聽，剛好那演講者也
是 reference 到很多他的東西，所以他一講完，馬上 Mr. Verdu 就問問題了，在這個地方我發現
外國人最大的優點就是超有自信的，也超級不怕問，不管面對的人是知名學者還是尚未出名的
人，都可以應答如流，而且問的人也是一樣，不會在乎他們自己的身份而問問題，到底是外國人
有自信？還是其實他們只是不怕問錯也不怕回答錯，勇氣很大，光是這一點，我就覺得大大贏過
亞洲人了，至少他們不怕害羞，不怕面子掛不住，這點是我們台灣研究人員所需要學習的。而且
國外人也較無面子問題吧！英文就算講的有口音一堆也依然照講。更甚者，其實在他們的心中重
點就是在於與人討論，因為有討論才會有火花，不用在乎個人的觀點是對是錯。個人認為在這些
會議中，能聽到難得的 good presentation 也是很幸運的。另一場去聽的演講是 Spatial Network
session 中的 Fractional Brownian Models for Vector Field Data，其演講者是來自 EPFL 的
學生，他做的東西雖然也是與我做的研究無關，但真的超有趣的，把 channel 一分再分，另外重
點是，他的 slides 也做得超好的，由簡單的東西去證明一個難的定理，就是去證一個以前很複
研究的主題內容我就比較聽不懂了，基本上，大部份也是因為跟我做的東西一點都沒有關係吧！
第四天一大早起來，因為今早是 poster session，接著下午就去了 ISIT 今年辦的 local tour，
沿途風景還不錯，就結束了這一天。 
第五天一大早聽完ISIT會議提供的Shannon lecture，這個lecture是專門給當年度的Shannon 
award 得獎者所給的演講，聽完後，覺得 Mr. Te San Han 算是在講一個 talk，而且是一個完全"
玩數學"的 talk，根本就是在想辦法創造一個新的數學工具，然後去驗證或證明一些以前的定理，
個人認為只能說是有趣，但實際的應用卻似乎不大，題目是 Musing upon Information Theory，
把 spectrum 的概念也融入到 information theory 裡，然後探討其可應用的性質，也許真的是要
像他們那種學過很多東西的人，才有辦法對一些事物產生 musing 吧！雖然清楚他大概想要講的
東西與內容，但就我的知識，實在找不到其他的應用就是了。 
 
二、與會心得： 
這一次的 ISIT 會議，是我第一次出國參加的國際會議，在會議上遇見很多國際上有名的人，以
及很多認真在做研究的人，覺得這真的是一件很令人感到興奮的事，可以激發很多新的想法，並
且更加地專注在自己的研究中，可惜的是，雖然我聽了很多的 talk 在這個會議中，但還是沒有
聽到太多與我的東西相關的研究主題，我的東西也許真的沒有太多人在做吧！但換個角度想，這
也許也是件不錯的事，代表我做的東西還可以有所發展，這也是參加會議的其中一個好處，可以
明白同個領域的人，做的研究是否有重疊，這樣子便可以再適時調整自己的研究方向。另外參加
完會議後，只會想要好好回台灣做研究，希望有一天自己也可以早日在台上發表並演說自己的研
究主題，我想這對於讓台灣學生多多參與國際會議也有所幫助，可以激厲學生的鬥志，讓台灣學
生明白國際上有多少厲害的人。最後還是覺得英文能力真的是很重要的一件事，需要長時間的磨
練才可以與一般人對答如流，還需要懂得英文語系的用法及簡短回應方式，才可以不致於誤解對
方的意思，雖然看到很多亞洲國家，如日本、韓國等的來的人，講的英文也是口音相當地重，但
他們的基本音節尚足以讓別人聽懂他們的英文是大概在講什麼，雖然還是有些人是都聽不懂的，
但是我們應該向可以把研究主題把英文表達得清楚的不同外國人學習，以達到可以將演說表達清
楚，讓別人明白我們在做什麼的研究之目的。
