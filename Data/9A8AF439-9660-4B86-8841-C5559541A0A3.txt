1. Motivation and purpose (研究動機及目的) 
Inverter [1-6] is an essential power unit of many power 
electronic equipments to provide variable voltage and/or 
variable frequency source with necessary dynamic control. 
Obviously, adequate PWM switching control is the first 
step to yield a high-performance inverter. And the 
sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) [1-4] is the simplest one in 
analysis, design and implementation. To meet some 
specific application requirements, there are still many 
modified SPWM schemes [1-4,7,8], such as optimal PWM 
[7], regular sampled PWM, selective harmonic elimination 
PWM, zero-sequence injection PWM [8], space-vector 
PWM [1,8], etc. In addition, some new PWM control 
methods are proposed recently [9-11]. If more stringent 
output performance is required, suitable current-controlled 
PWM (CCPWM) schemes [1-4,12-16] should further be 
adopted. Basically, there are three types of CCPWM 
schemes, namely ramp-comparison [1-4,12-14], hysteresis 
[1-4,15] and predictive control schemes [1-4,16]. As to the 
inverter controls made in [13,14], the close waveform 
tracking is achieved by using simple robust control 
technique. And also in [15], a robust varying-band control 
is developed to let the hysteresis CCPWM inverter have 
constant switching frequency, and it is successfully 
applied to an electromagnetic shaker. 
For a high-performance inverter, the sophisticated 
dynamic control is indispensible to yield the desired 
waveforms under unknown, changing and nonlinear loads. 
During the past decades, there were a lot of studies 
[5,17-25] being devoted to yield improved inverter output 
characteristics to meet specific load requirements. In [21], 
the neural network adaptive control is employed to let the 
single-phase inverter possess fast transient response with 
low total harmonic distortion (THD). This can make the 
resulted inverter be suitable in some critical applications, 
such as dynamic voltage restorer and UPS. In [22], a 
computer-controlled three-phase AC power source was 
developed, and the multivariable repetitive robust model

2.1.1. 3P1SW SMR 
In the inverter system shown in Fig. 2, a 3P1SW SMR 
is used as the front-end to establish the DC-link voltage 
from utility. By operating it in DCM, the PFC function is 
naturally preserved without applying current-controlled 
PWM switching. Hence it belongs to a simple voltage 
follower controlled SMR. However, it possesses the 
disadvantages of: (i) Having higher input peak current and 
switch stress; (ii) Input line current contains significant 
lower-frequency harmonics with the orders of 6n ± 1, n=1, 
2, …, and the dominant ones are the 5th and 7th harmonics. 
Thus suitable AC-side low-pass filter is required to yield 
satisfactory power quality; (iii) Line drawn power quality 
is limited. To improve the input power quality of this 
SMR, many researches have been conducted, for example: 
(i) Fifth-order harmonic band-stop filtering; (ii) Harmonic 
injection approach; (iii) Variable switching frequency 
controls; (iv) Passive filtering and input current steering; 
(v) Optimum PWM pattern.  
A. Design of System Components 
The analysis and design of this SMR can be conducted 
using the single-phase equivalent circuit. The details can 
be referred to the existing literatures [37,53], and only a 
brief description is given: (i) the single-phase equivalent 
output voltage is 3/dcoe VV = ; (ii) to ensure the DCM 
operation under all possible conditions, the energy storage 
inductor is designed to yield boundary condition at the 
peak of line voltage cycle under worst cases.  
The SMR specifications are given as: (i) three-phase 
AC input source: HzV 60/220 , hence V220=LV , and 
V63.1793/2202 =×=mV ; (ii) DC output: V350=dcV , 
kW3=dcP ( Ω= 83.40LR ); (iii) PWM switching frequency 
kHz20=sf .

The inductor is wound on the toroidal core APH47P60 
manufactured by AMOSENSE company using 13 turns of 
AWG #10 wire. The calculated designed inductance is 
,46.15 HLb µ=  and the measured inductances of three 
inductors 1bL , 2bL  and 3bL  using HIOKI 3532-50 LCR 
meter are: (i) 60Hz: HLb µ147.151 = , HLb µ257.162 = ,

toroidal core T250-26 and AWG #10 wire with 25 turns. 
The measured inductances of three inductors are: (i)

Design of Inductor: 
(a) Wire gauge 
Under rated resistive load, the inductor rms current is 
A09.9V110W1000 = . However, the current will be 
much larger under highly nonlinear loads. Hence the 
AWG #10 wire with average current 20A is chosen. 
(b) Core and turns 
(i) Core: The toroidal core CH57125 manufactured by 
Changsung Corporation is chosen here.  
(ii) Winding: Using LA , the turns number N can be

The output filter inductor L  shown in Fig. 2 is 
divided into two parts, and each ( L /2) is placed on one 
individual line. The inductor with 2L = 0.079mH  is 
designed as followed. From the known value of LA = 
)(0.156 2NnH , N ≈ 23 is obtained.  
The measured inductances of the wound inductor ( L /2)

C. The Proposed Robust Waveform Control Scheme 
The proposed robust waveform control scheme for the 
developed single-phase inverter is shown in Fig. 2. Both 
voltage and current control loops possess the same robust 
two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) structure. And the 
ramp-comparison current-controlled PWM (RC-CCPWM) 
switching scheme is employed. In each control loop, the 
feedback controller is augmented with a command 
feedforward controller and a robust voltage error 
cancellation controller to yield good waveform tracking 
control. As generally recognized, the load of an inverter is 
usually nonlinear, varying and unknown, its accurate 
dynamic model is difficult to obtain. It follows that the 
intuitive approach is utilized here to determine the 
parameters of the constituted controllers. And the robust 
control is applied to enhance the control robustness.  
Design Methodology: 
Taking the voltage loop as an example, the design 
methodology of the proposed control scheme is as follows: 
(i) the feedback controller is designed at nominal case 
applying possible practical approach; (ii) the command 
feedforward controller is set as )1/()( 10 ssccsGcfv τ
∆
++= , 
and first tuned on-line at nominal case to yield the best 
waveform tracking control; (iii) to reduce the tracking 
error caused by system parameter and operation changes 
and also the effects of system disturbances, a robust 
tracking error controller is further added. The original 
command *av  is augmented by a robust compensation 
control command to yield the modified command 
vvaa
swvv ε)(**1 +=  for obtaining the improved and robust 
waveform tracking control. The weighting function 
)(swv is employed to make the compromise between the 
control performance, the system stability and the required 
control effort.   
Under highly nonlinear load conditions, the output 
voltage waveform may be distorted due to the following 
reasons: (i) ferroresonance effects caused by the output 
transformer and the capacitors placed on the primary and 
secondary sides; (ii) the flux imbalance of transformer 
inverter DC output component caused by imbalance PWM 
switching. Adding a series capacitor in the inverter output 
is a traditional remedy approach. In this research, the 
robust compensation approach is proposed. Hence, to 
further enhance the waveform quality, a voltage error 
feedforward compensator (VEFC) and a flux imbalance 
compensator (FIC) are added to yield the additional 
compensation signals contev and contdv , which are 
injected into the PWM control scheme. 
In performing digital control realization, the sampling 
rates of all control loops are chosen to be: (i) current loop: 
it is set the same as PWM switching frequency, i.e., 
kHz15== ssi ff ; (ii) voltage-loop: since the instantaneous 
voltage waveform control is made, the voltage loop 
sampling rate is also chosen to be kHz15=svf . The 
feedback current and voltage sensing scaling factors are 
set as AV1.0=iK and .VV005.0=vK The constituted 
components of the proposed inverter control scheme are 
designed below. 
 
D. Design of Robust RC-CCPWM Scheme 
(a) Current feedback controller (CFBC) 
The current feedback controller is chosen to be PI type:   
s
KKsG IiPicbi +=)(                        (9) 
The parameters are determined at the chosen nominal 
condition ( V350=dcV , Hz60V220=ov , Ω5.53=LR , 
W67.904=oP ), where the DC-link voltage dcV V350=  is 
established by the developed SMR. 
The proportional gain PIK  is first determined based 
on the large signal stability criterion of a RC-CCPWM 
mechanism, which is required that the time rate of control 
voltage is smaller than those of triangular carrier, i.e., 
)/()/( dtdvdtdv tricont < . Using the set system parameters, 
it is found that that 
375.0<⇒< Pitricont Kdt

              (10) 
Accordingly, 25.0=PiK  is chosen. Finally, the integral 
gain IiK is designed via trial-and-error approach to yield:

(b) Current command feedforward controller (CCFC) 
Basically, the current command feedforward controller 
)(sGcfi  should be set equal to the inverse model of the 
controlled plant. However, the exact inverse model is 
difficult to obtain for the varying plant model. In this 
project, the parameters of )(sGcfi  are determined by 
on-line adjusting to obtain closer current tracking 
performance under nominal case as:

waveform can be observed from the results. The power 
quality parameters of the related variables are labeled in 
Figs. 5(a) and 5(d). However, some extent of output 
voltage waveform is also seen. This is caused by the 
ferro-resonance formed by the LF output transformer and 
the load capacitor, and this will be improved by the 
proposed HF isolated inverter introduced later.

B. Transient Waveform Tracking Characteristics 
(a) Step magnitude change 
Te voltage magnitude change response is very 
important for a universal AC power source, which is 
usually employed for making the line regulation test of 
various power supplies. Let the proposed complete voltage 
control scheme be operated, Fig. 6 shows the measured ov′  
and *ov  due to a 10% step change of voltage magnitude 
( HzV 60/220  to HzV 60/242 ) at linear load case 2. Fast 
line regulation is obtained by the developed inverter.

(c) Programmable waveform 
For making the performance evaluation of some 
specific equipments, the AC voltage source containing 
some programmed harmonic components is required. 
Hence a voltage command containing fundamental and six 
lower order harmonics is defined as:

where N  denotes the number of constituted frequency

designed control scheme are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Close 
waveform tracking characteristics can also be seen from 
the results.

A. Circuit Analysis 
In making analytic derivations, it is assumed that: (i) all 
constituted components are ideal; and (ii) dV =constant. 
Let this converter be operated under CCM with os ωω > , 
the sketched Li  and cv  are shown in Fig. 12(a). Within 
one switching period, the operation can be divided into 
four modes with their circuits being drawn in Fig. 12(b) to 
Fig. 12(e). In the established resonant converter, the duty 
ratio sson TttTtd )( 12 −==
∆
, ( 5.00 ≤≤ d ) is kept constant 
( 45.0=d  here), and accordingly the dead-time becomes

in Fig. 12(c), and from which one can find that the circuit 
equations are the same as in (21)-(24). From (25) one can

At sTtt 5.02 == , the other switch pair ),( −+ BA TT  
are turn-off to yield the circuit schematic shown in Fig.

following the ones made in Mode 1. The waveforms of 
Li  and cv  are asymmetrical to those of Mode1 around 
the time axis. 
(d) Mode 4, 43 ttt ≤<  
The circuit is shown in Fig. 12(e) with its solutions 
being asymmetrical to those of Mode 2 around time axis.  
The voltage transfer ratios dcdv VVA = simulated from 
Fig. 11 under different switching frequencies at Ω100=oR  
are plotted in Fig. 12(f). The control characteristics from 
sf  ( os ff > ) to vA  can be aware from the results.  
B. Transformer Design 
  In performing the design of high-frequency power 
transformer used in the converter shown in Fig. 11, the 
specifications are given as: (i) V,360~340=dcV V400=dV ; 
(ii) output: kW2=dP , A5=dI ; (iii) duty 45.0=D ; (iv) 
nominal switching frequency kHz50=sf ; (v) efficiency 
9.0=η . The wire AWG#14 is chosen to wind the 
windings on the core AMCU-32. The turns of primary and 
secondary are found to be 14 and 18 turns, respectively. 
The key parameters are measured by HIOKI 3532-50 LCR 
meter to be: =sL primary leakage inductance Hµ78.50= (at 
50kHz), HLm µ02.135= (at 50kHz).

2.3. Single-Module Three-Phase LF-Isolated Inverter  
Undoubtedly, the three-phase inverters should be used 
to power large capacity equipments. Basically, three-phase 
inverters can be constructed using single power 
semiconductor module with six switches or via proper 
connection of multiple single-phase inverter modules. For 
the former type, a LF-isolated and a HF-isolated 
three-phase inverters are established in this project. The 
LF-isolated one is first presented as followed.    
2.3.1. System Configuration 
The developed DSP-based single module three-phase 
LF-isolated inverter and its control scheme are shown in 
Fig. 14. The 3P1SW SMR is used to establish 
well-regulated DC-link voltage for the inverter. The 
galvanic isolation is provided by a Y- ∆  connected three 
phase line-frequency power transformer. By sensing the 
primary phase voltage 
av
, bv  and cv , the voltage 
controls for this three-phase inverter can be treated as 
three independent single-phase inverters. The detailed 
control system configuration of a-phase is shown in Fig. 
14, which is identical to those introduced previously. The 
control algorithms of all power stages are realized in a 
common DSP. The constituted system components and 
their ratings are listed as follows: 
(i) AC input: φ3 AC, Hz60V220 . 
(ii) AC output: oV = Hz60V220 (nominal), kW1 , 
programmable voltage and frequency. 
(iii) DC-link: VVdc 350= , FCdc µ3760= / V800 . (iv) Output transformer: 63.5V/220V (1/3.5), line 
frequency power transformer with laminated core. 
(v) Output filter: L=0.158mH / 20A, C=10 Fµ /1000V.  
(vi) Inverter: Which is implemented using the IGBT 
module PS21265-P/AP ( V600=CESV / 20A=CI  (continuous), 40A=CI (pulsed)) manufactured by 
Mitsubishi Semiconductor. 
(vii) PWM schemes: RC-CCPWM switching scheme     
with switching frequency kHz15=sf . (viii)Sensing factors: V/01.0 Vkv = , AVkv /1.0= . 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 14. Single-module three-phase LF-isolated inverter system configuration and its control scheme. 
 
2.3.2. Output Filter 
The cut-off frequency of output filter is also set as 
kHz4=cf , and thus similarly, C= Fµ10 / 450V and 
L=0.158mH. The inductor is wound using AWG #10 wire 
on a toroidal core T250-26 (Micrometal Cooperation). 
From the know parameters L=0.158mH, the turn number 
is found to be 26=N . The measured inductances of the 
three wound inductors by LCR meter HIOKI 3532-50 are 
listed as follows: 100Hz =f : ,18.7mESR/81.154 Ωµ == HLA      
,17.91mESR/36.151 Ωµ == HLB .16.74mESR/34.152 Ωµ == HLC  
15kHz =f  : Ωµ m16.185ESR/48.153 == HLA ,
,m44.168ESR/10.150 Ωµ == HLB .m83.661ESR/10.151 Ωµ == HLC

2.4. Single-Module Three-Phase HF-Isolated Inverter  
2.4.1. System Configuration 
The developed DSP-based single module three-phase 
HF-isolated inverter and its control scheme are shown in 
Fig. 19. The isolation is provided by the series resonant 
DC/DC converter, which has been established previously. 
Similarly, the control algorithms of all power stages are 
realized in a common DSP. The system parameters are the 
same as those of LF-isolated inverter except that:  
 DC-links: V350=dcV , FCdc µ5600= , V400=dV , 
FCd µ3760= / V800 . dcV  and dV  are respectively   
regulated by the SMR front-end and the series resonant 
DC/DC converter. 
 Sensing factors: V/01.0 Vkv = , AVkv /35.0= . 
2.4.2.
 
Control Schemes  
The set parameter of all control schemes shown in Fig. 
19 are listed as follows: 
• ,/25.001.1)( ssGcbv += )0451/(048.055.0)( sssGcfv ++=

• ),1031.51/(015.0)( 4 sswe −×+= )01.01/(05.0)( sswd +=  
 
2.4.3. Performance Evaluation 
  Fig. 20 shows the measured inverter output three phase 
voltages, filter currents and their commands under 
unbalanced linear load case 3. And the ones at nonlinear 
load case 4 are plotted in Fig. 21. The related power 
quality parameters are labeled in Figs. 20 and 21. Fig. 22 
shows the measured load line voltage abv , dv and 
dcv waveform due to sudden load change from case 1 to case 2. 
Good regulation response is observed. Compared to the 
LF-isolated inverter, the HF-isolated inverter possesses less 
voltage distortion in nonlinear load.

2.6.2. Performance Evaluation 
A. ∆ -Connected 
Fig. 27 shows the measured inverter output three phase 
voltages, filter currents and their commands under 
unbalanced linear load case 3. And the ones at nonlinear 
load case 4 are plotted in Fig. 28.  
 
B. V-Connected 
  Now let one module shown in Fig. 26 is removed, Fig. 
29 and Fig, 30 show the measured results at the same 
conditions as those of Fig. 27 and Fig. 28. The results of 
−∆ and V-connected inverters indicate that: (i) 
V-connected inverter still can provide three-phase voltage 
outputs with good performances; but (ii) the voltage 
distortion of V-connected are slightly higher, particularly 
for the third phase ( cav ), since it is synthesized via 
natural circuit connection.
