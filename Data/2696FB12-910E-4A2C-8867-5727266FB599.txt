Abstract－We present a wavelength switching 
scheme with three overlapped erbium-doped fiber 
laser (EDFL) cavities. To the best of our 
knowledge, the design issue on obtaining 
switching among different wavelengths has not 
been fully discussed yet. In this study, we give a   
discussion on the effect of external optical 
injection power on the wavelength switching 
among three wavelengths. We also show that the 
side-mode-suppression ratio achievable in the 
laser scheme is dependent on the light power 
injected into the fiber laser cavity and the 
wavelength of the injection light. The EDFL 
designed here lases at the wavelengths 1545.3 nm, 
1550.2 nm and 1555.2 nm with achievable 
side-mode-suppression ratios of 27.5 dB, 34.4 dB 
and 34.8 dB, respectively.

I. Introduction 
Recently, many kinds of tunable 
erbium-doped fiber lasers (EDFLs) have 
been proposed and demonstrated. A few 
examples of EDFLs are the wide-band 
tunable fiber ring laser employing an 
intracavity fiber Fabry-Pérot filter [1], 
the single-wavelength and 
multiwavelength fiber laser with 
changing pumping power in an 
overlapped fiber Bragg grating (FBG) 
structure [2], the tunable lasers 
employing  tunable bandpass filters and 
Fabry-Pérot laser diodes (FPLD) within 
the laser cavities [3-5] , the tunable laser 
combining two fiber Bragg gratings, a

long period grating and a linear polarizer 
to control polarizer-dependent loss [6], 
the tunable L-band fiber ring laser 
through cavity loss control via fiber 
bending in the fiber laser loop[7], the 
multiwavelength tunable fiber ring laser 
based on a sampled chirped FBG [8], and 
the S-band tunable laser by bending a 
section of depressed-cladding 
erbium-doped fiber (EDF) to suppress 
the lasing of wavelengths in C-band [9] .  
Alternatively, to obtain a fast 
wavelength switching, external optical 
injection into the laser cavity has been 
suggested and demonstrated. Optical 
spectral bistability of a fiber loop with a 
semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) 
being as a gain medium was utilized to 
switch between two wavelengths by 
using external optical injection into the 
fiber loop [10]. Such wavelength 
switching results from mode competition 
through gain saturation in SOA. On the 
other hand, an EDFL with two 
overlapped cavities also showed the gain 
saturation effect with external optical 
injection, as indicated by [11]. However, 
the overlapped fiber cavity configuration 
did not provide wavelength switching 
between the two wavelengths as planned. 
Furthermore, the design issue on 
obtaining switching among different 
wavelengths has not been fully discussed 
yet. 
In this paper, we present a 
wavelength switching scheme with three 
overlapped EDFL cavities, to address the 
effect of the external optical injection 
power on the wavelength switching 
among the three wavelengths. The rest of 
this paper is organized as follows. In 
section two, the experimental setup for 
the wavelength switching is outlined. 
Experimental results and discussions are 
given in section three. Then section four 
 
Fig.2  Output powers of the EDFL shown in Fig.1 at 
the Bragg wavelengths of the three FBGs as a function 
of the pump power when there is no external optical 
injection.  
 
 
As can be seen from Fig.2, for a 
pump power of 65 mW, the lasing power 
at λ= 1555.2 nm is -5.2 dBm in contrast 
with -40 dBm, the power at the 
neighboring wavelength 1550.2 nm. The 
side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) is 
thus 34.8 dB for this lasing wavelength 
in this case. That is, the as-designed 
EDFL without external optical injection 
would lase atλ= 1555.2 nm with an 
SMSR of 34.8 dB for a pump power of 
65 mW. We then fixed the pump power 
for the optically injected EDFL under 
study. Meanwhile, we chose the 
wavelength of the tunable laser to be 
1560 nm. By changing the power of the 
tunable laser, we observed the results of 
wavelength switching. Figure 3 shows 
the output powers of the 
wavelength-switchable EDFL at the three 
wavelengths 1545.3 nm, 1550.2 nm and 
1555.2nm, versus the injection source 
power. As can be seen from this figure, 
when little power, say at the level of 
-12.5 dBm, is injected, the laser lases 
preferentially at 1555.2 nm, i.e., at the 
Bragg wavelength of FBG3, as shown in 
Fig.4. This is consistent with the result 
shown in Fig.2.  
 
 
Fig.3 Output powers of the proposed 
wavelength-switchable EDFL at the Bragg 
wavelengths of the three FBGs, as a function of optical 
injection power. The pump power is 65 mW and the 
wavelength of the tunable laser is 1560 nm.     
 
 
 
Fig 4 Output spectrum of the proposed 
wavelength-switchable EDFL for an injection power of 
-12.5 dBm. The pump power is 65 mW and the 
wavelength of the tunable laser is 1560 nm. 
 
As the optical injection power of the 
proposed EDFL is increased, the lasing 
power at λ = 1550.2 nm increased. 
When the optical injection power is 
increased to -2 dBm, the laser would 
cease lasing at λ = 1555.2 nm because 
the injected light gets amplified by the 
combined lengths of EDF1+EDF2+EDF3 
and depletes the inverted population for 
that wavelength. Meanwhile, the laser 
begins to support a gain only at λ
=1550.2 nm, i.e., at the Bragg 
wavelength of FBG2, because the 
combined lengths of EDF1+EDF2 is too 
short to get the injected light strong 
enough for competing against the lasing 
system of Fig.1 and measured the 
resultant SMSR. Figure 8 shows the 
SMSRs as a function of injection power 
for various wavelengths of the tunable 
laser ( i.e., for 1560 nm, 1562.5 nm, 1565 
nm and 1567.5 nm) when the pump 
power is fixed at 65 mW. The SMSRs for 
the lasing wavelengths 1545.3 nm, 
1550.2 nm and 1555.2 nm are shown in 
Figs.8(a), (b) and (c), respectively. For 
the lasing wavelength 1545.3 nm, the 
highest SMSR, 27.5 dB, occurs at an 
optical injection power of 3.5 dBm and 
an optical injection wavelength of 1560 
nm, as shown in Fig. 8(a) (see the curve 
with filled squares). Nevertheless, as Fig. 
8(b) indicates, the highest SMSR, 36.2 
dB, occurs at an optical injection power 
of -0.5 dBm and an optical injection 
wavelength of 1565 nm for the lasing at 
1550.2 nm (see the curve with up-sided 
triangles). However, if we choose the 
optical injection wavelength 1565 nm for 
the lasing at 1545.3 nm, then the 
resultant SMSR would be reduced to 
25.7 dB for the best case, i.e., at an 
optical injection power of 5 dBm (see the 
curve with up-sided triangles). For the 
reason of maintaining a high SMSR as 
possible, i.e., 27.5 dB, for the lasing 
wavelength 1545.3 nm, we suggest using 
the optical injection wavelength 1560 nm 
in the case under study. Meanwhile, Fig. 
8(c) shows that there is no much 
difference in SMSR among the four 
optical injection wavelengths for the 
lasing at 1555.2 nm when the optical 
injection power is very low, say at -12.5 
dBm.

fixed at 65 mW. The SMSRs for the lasing wavelengths 
1545.3 nm, 1550.2 nm and 1555.2 nm are shown in (a),
