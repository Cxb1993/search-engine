一、Abstract 
 
Bio-materials under consideration consist of 
soft and hard components, such as protein and 
mineral crystals. The analytical solutions 
provided demonstrate an effect of the 
concentration of protein on the response of 
the material to compressive loading parallel to 
the direction of mineral crystals. The 
solutions may also serve as benchmark 
problems for verifying numerical codes. 
 
Keywords ： viscoelasticity, protein, mineral 
crystal, qualitative effects, analytical solution 
 
二、緣由與目的 
1. Two point forces applied to the 
surface of half-space. 
 
Assume that two point forces 2p  are applied 
to half-space of viscoelastic material as 
shown in Figure 1. Choose a Cartesian 
coordinate system xy such that its x-axis is 
directed into the material. The distance from 
this axis and each of the forces is a. The 
forces act along the x-direction. The 
dependence between the deviator stress and 
strain components is given by the following 
alternative equations 
 
     
0

or 
 
     

,
t
ij ije t C t s d s             (2) 
 
 
where ij  are the deviatoric stress components, 
ije  are the deviator strain components, t is the 
time,   is the function of relaxation, C  is the 
function of creep. Also, the relation between 
the hydrostatic stress,  , and the volumetric 
strain,  , is 
 
   t K t               (3) 
 
where K is the bulk modulus. 
 
The starting point is the linear elastic solution. 
It can be found by the superposition method 
having the solution for the single point force.

direction. The corresponding displacement is 
denoted by v. A cylindrical coordinate system 
rz is chosen such that its axis of symmetry 
coincides with the axis of the fiber (Figure 2). 
 
  
 
The concentration of the protein is 
characterizing by the ratio b a . The solution 
is independent of  and z. The boundary 
conditions are 
 
0zu                 (9) 
 
at r b  and  
 
zu v              (10) 
 
at r a . Here zu  is the axial displacement. 
Obviously that v is a function of the time, t. It 
is assumed that 
 
 sinv A t             (11) 
 
where A and  are constant. Since the process 
of loading is studied, the time interval under 
consideration is 0 2t   .  
 
The starting point is the linear elastic solution. 
The only non-trivial equilibrium equation is 
 
0rz rz

 
              (12) 
 
Here rz  is the shear stress in the cylindrical 
coordinate system. The general solution to 
equation (12) is 
 
0
rz

              (13) 
 
It follows from the Hooke’s law that 
 
2rz rz              (14) 
 
Here  is the shear modulus and rz  is the 
shear strain in the cylindrical coordinate 
system. Since the solution is independent of z 
and the radial velocity vanishes, the shear 
strain is given by

一、參加會議經過 
The conference was organized by the Department of Mathematics of the University of 
Chemical Technology and Metallurgy. The previous four International Conferences on Applied 
Mathematics and Computing were held in Plovdiv in 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004. The fifth 
conference was held from August 12, 2008 to August 18, 2009 in Plovdiv (Bulgaria). The 
topics of the conference covered many aspects of the applied mathematics and its application 
to computing. For the research conducted at Yung-Ta Institute of Technology and Commerce, 
the most important of these topics were that related to fundamental and applied aspects of 
plasticity theory and its applications to metal forming processes and structural design. Many 
distinguished researchers and scientists were invited to give talks at the conference. The title of 
my presentation was: An exact solution in strain gradient plasticity. My paper dealt with 
distinguished mathematical qualitative features solutions based on gradient theories of 
plasticity and focused on new ideas related to the solution behaviour in the vicinity of stress 
concentrators.  
 
二、心得 ： 
The conference was very useful for understanding numerical methods to deal with singular 
solutions for a number of material models. I had several discussions on the applicability of numerical 
methods to describing singular behaviour of solutions in the vicinity of frictional interfaces with 
researchers from several European countries.
