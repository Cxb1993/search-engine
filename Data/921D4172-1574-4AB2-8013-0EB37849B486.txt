multi-variable and multi-modal space. 
However, when the dimension is high and 
there are numerous local optima, the particular 
challenge has shown that the TGA does not 
only have the premature convergence, but 
may also be trapped in the local optima and 
also produces different values in each run. In 
order to prevent the premature convergence of 
the TGA, the clonal proliferation within 
hypermutation in the immune algorithm (IA) 
is used to provide the several chromosome 
diversifications. Besides, in order to promote 
the capability of robustness for a TGA, the 
experimental design method, a robust design 
approach, is used as an unified-evolution 
strategy to intelligently build combinatorial 
steps. In comparison to the random search of a 
TGA, the systematic reasoning ability of the 
experimental design method may enhance the 
abilities of the robust local search and quick 
convergence. In a word, the research project is 
to integrate the TGA, the IA, and the 
experimental design method to generate a new 
robust intelligent optimization algorithm that 
has the robust and quickly convergent abilities. 
In addition, the algorithm is applied to solve 
many different optimization problems and the 
optimal fuzzy time-delay control problems, 
and to show its capability and feasibility. 
Finally, the proposed algorithm is shown to be 
the best approach to solve the optimization 
problems.

前言與研究目的 
最佳化技術在現代工程設計與系統操
作參數設計上，扮演相當重要的角色，並廣
泛應用於不同的工程領域，如系統控制、人
工智能、模式識別、排程規劃、VLSI 設計
、計算機工程、…等等。由以上所述之應用
領域整理歸納，最佳化問題包含數學函數優
化、參數(含控制器參數)設計最佳化、與組
合最佳化等問題，這些問題包含了解空間是
連續變量與離散狀態。因此，發展一套最佳
化演算法可有效的解決最佳化問題成為一
大重要課題。 
一種新演算法的提出，並不是為解決特
定問題，而應是可廣泛解決不同領域的不同
問題，如此才可驗證所提出的演算法確實有
效。本計畫案係依據本計畫案主持人執行
2004 年至 2006 年國科會計畫案之研究經驗
，以及依據本計畫案主持人與其學生過去幾
年來在最佳化演算法的研究經驗（Chou et 
al., 2000; Hsieh et al., 2000, 2001, 2002; Tsai 
et al., 2004, 2006; Ho and Chou, 2005; Liu et

新穎的最佳智能演算法，進而解決以上所述
之問題，更進一步提供成為解決最佳化問題
之更新穎的最佳演算法。本計畫案主持人在
幾年前是靠調整選擇基因演算法中之操作
參數來提升演算法之效益(Chou et al., 2000; 
Hsieh et al., 2000, 2001, 2002)，但是成效有
限。因此，在近些年來(2004~2006 年)，本
計畫案主持人在執行其國科會計畫案中，係
從基因演算法的內部繁殖（breeding）機制
作改進，達成更有效率地提升演算法的成效
（Tsai et al., 2004, 2006; Ho and Chou, 2005; 
Liu et al., 2006）。在該研究中係從結合傳統
之基因演算法與強健設計之田口品質工程
法出發，利用此兩種方法的優點(如：全域
搜尋能力與系統性推算能力)，提出一個以
田口品質工程法為基礎來建構演化式策略

也有多位學者專家提出混合免疫基因演算
法的概念來改進基因演算法之成效，詳細的
文獻回顧及討論，可參考 Jiao 等人的專著
(Jiao et al., 2006)。這些學者專家提出之混合
免疫基因演算法是採用加入免疫疫苗於基
因演算法中，其構想與方法完全不同於本計
畫案提出之構想與方法。而且目前文獻中被
提出之混合免疫基因演算法，仍然採用隨機
交配操作機制，因此運算結果無法獲得強健
的且良好的成效。另外，本計畫案主持人近
年來之國科會計畫案中是採用田口品質工
程法的直交表，來建構系統化的交配推理能
力。當參數因子間有交互作用影響時，實驗
設計法之部份因子規劃表比田口法之直交
表，能有更良好的組合成效(Bhote, 1991; 
Montgomery, 2005)。因此，從上述的分析與
說明，顯示值得引進結合免疫演算法、基因
演算法、及有效的實驗部份因子規劃表，再
作更深入的研討。 
參數設計最佳化問題常見於數位信號
處理之濾波器參數設計，其中數位無限脈衝
響應(infinite impulse response, IIR)濾波器是
較常用的形式之一，其設計屬於相當複雜的
多變數與多目標最佳化問題，而且目標與目
標之間經常互相違背。早期，數位 IIR 濾波
器之設計皆利用類比轉換成數位之技術來
完成(Daniels, 1974; Lam, 1979)，最常見的形
式如巴特握斯濾波器(Butterworth filter)、柴
比雪夫濾波器(Chebyshev filter)、橢圓濾波
器(Elliptic filter)、貝索濾波器(Bessel filter)
。由於所需設計的參數與性能指標太多，常
為取得妥協導致性能不佳或階數過高，造成
實用上的缺點。近年來，為克服以上所提之
困難，多數的研究者(for example, Ng et al., 
1994; Li and Yin, 1996; Harris and Ifeachor, 
1998; Tang et al., 1998; Vanuytsel et al., 2002; 
Zhang et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 
2006; and references therein)利用基因演算法
，來搜尋最佳參數與得到較佳之數位 IIR 濾
波器。除此之外，為兼顧濾波器的性能，評
估函數(如 p-error、mean-square-error、通帶
漣波大小、止帶漣波大小、…)亦為重要因
素之一，其中 p-error 指標常被研究者(for 
example, Deczky, 1972; Deczky, 1976; 
Cortelazzo and Lightner, 1984; Lang, 1992; 
Kafri, 1997; Tarczynski et al., 2001; Vanuytsel, 
et al., 2002; and Zhang et al., 2003; Liu et al., 
2004; Tsai et al., 2006)所使用。雖然目前採用
基因演算法之成果已顯示其成效，但是，由
於數位 IIR 濾波器設計參數與性能指標過多
，所以基因演算法常有捉襟見肘的困境，急
待結合其他軟式計算的方法及其他有效的
分析工具，再尋求更進一步的突破。 
組合最佳化問題是另一個與上述之數
學函數優化問題及參數設計最佳化問題完
全不同屬性的問題，是運籌學中的一個重要
領域，其包含旅行者問題(travelling salesman 
problem, TSP)、排程問題、背包問題、裝箱
問題、離散空間下機器人之路徑規劃、…等
，其中排程問題是相當複雜的調度規劃問題
，屬於 NP-hard 等級的問題，此類問題並非
單純之連續數值求解，而是非數值類的離散
且多限制條件之排序問題。此類最佳化求解
很困難，主要原因是所謂的 “組合爆炸”。
早期的研究者大多以Blackstone et al. (1982)
所發展的分派法則(Dispatching Rule)來解決
零工式(job-shop scheduling problem, JSP)的
排程問題，由於問題困難度實在太高，所以

Biegel and Davern, 1990; Gupta et al., 1993; 
Gen et al., 1994; Kumar and Srinivasan, 1996; 
Ono et al., 1996; Shi, 1997; Gen and Cheng,

有本計畫案主持人與其學生(Ho et al., 2005)
針對時變 TS 模糊模型動態控制系統，來探
討設計二次最佳平行分配補償控制器之研

已有初步成效，但是在尋找最佳控制參數及
設計運算速度等方面，仍不易獲得滿意之效

如：軋鋼過程、生理系統、化學反應過程、
網路傳遞…等系統，時間延遲(time delay)通
常是使系統變的不穩定，以及讓系統性能

總之，本研究計畫案之研究目的在於發

化問題之最佳智能演算法。 
 
研究方法 
本研究計畫分成三個年度進行，以下分
別描述每一年度的研究重點、方法、步驟與
應用問題。 
第一年度 
第一年度係結合免疫演算法、基因演算
法、及有效的實驗部份因子規劃表。首先運
用免疫演算法中之超突變克隆機制於基因
演算法中，以產生更多樣性的染色體族群，
然後將實驗設計法之部份因子規劃表的系
統性推理能力合併在具全域搜尋能力的免
  8
依據較高的突變率進行線性內插，以達到產
生多樣性之染色體族群的目的。例如：母代
為 ( )Nkji xxxxxxx  , , , , , , , 21 KK= ，其中 ix 染
色體被決定進行突變，然後再任意選擇 kx 染
色體來搭配線性內插，則此一染色體串突變
後的新子代 x′如下所述： 
( )Nkji xxxxxxx  , , , , , , , 21 KK ′=′   (1.3) 
其中 ( ) kii xxx ββ +−=′ 1 與 β 是屬於[0, 1]的
亂數值。因此可產生多樣化的子代，避免早
熟發生。 
突變方式 
突變的基本觀念亦來自凸集合理論之
線性內插法(Bazaraa et al., 1990; Gen and 
Cheng, 1997)，也就是在同一個染色體中任
意選取兩點進行線性內插，以達到突變的目
的，如此突變的方法亦可視為在空間中進行
微 調 。 例 如 ： 母 代 為
( )Nkji xxxxxxx  , , , , , , , 21 KK= ，任意選擇 xi 
和 xk 為欲突變之基因，則突變方法與新的
子代 'x 如下所述： 
( )Nkji xxxxxxx  , , , , , , , 21 KK ′′=′   (1.4) 
其中 ( ) kii xxx ββ +−= 1' ， ( ) kik xxx ββ −+= 1'
，與β 是屬於[0, 1]的亂數值。 
（二）實驗設計部份因子設計 
本研究計畫案以部份因子規劃設計法
來建構智慧型推理重組機制，以更有效率的
方式產生最優良子代來增進混合免疫基因
演算法的穩健局部搜尋能力。部份因子設計
(Montgomery, 2005)假設某些高階之交互作
用(interaction)是可忽略的，使得即使只選取
完全因子實驗(full factorial design)中的一部
份仍可達到所要的效果，而所選取出來的一
部份，並不是隨便選擇的，該部份實驗是要
能夠投影到一個完整實驗。使用部份因子設
計可大幅增加實驗的運算效率，而其主要的
用途在於篩選實驗(screening experiments)，
其技術已被廣泛的使用在工業應用上。本計
畫 案 以 2 個 水 準 值 (level) 、 多 變 數
(multi-variable)的部份因子設計之規劃表，
做為智慧型推理重組機制的實驗設計依據。 
（三）系統化推理產生優良子代機制 
以下四個步驟即為使用部份因子規劃
表之系統化推理產生優良子代機制的過程
，敘述如下： 
步驟 1：根據變數向量維度的大小建立相對
應的規劃表，可產生一個 1−M 欄
， M 列的規劃表，取前面 N 欄來
使用。其中 N 是變數向量維度的大
小， ( )[ ]1log22 += NM 。 
步驟 2：若該變數所對應到的水準值為“1
＂，表示父代，則以 kx 表示；若所
對應到的水準值為“2＂，表示母
代，則以 kx′表示。 
步 驟 3 ： 計 算 每 一 列 的 目 標 函 數 值
Mifi  , ,1, K= 。 
步驟 4：計算每一欄的主效果(main effect)
，找出每一欄中，具有較佳貢獻度
的水準值，依據以下的公式： 
∑
=
=×=
M
i
ji
j
k NkLfS
1
 ..., 2, ,1,  (1.5) 
當第 k 欄中的第 i 列的水準值為 j
時， 1=jL ；反之 0=jL ；其中 j 為
“1＂或“2＂。比較各欄中計算出
的兩水準值之主效果，當所求問題
的是適應函數最大化時，則具較大
主效果的水準值貢獻度較佳；反之
，所求問題為適應函數最小化時，
較小主效果的水準值貢獻度較佳
。則最佳的因子組合即為各欄中具
較佳貢獻度的主效果之水準值所
對應到之變數所成的組合，所得到
的這組值，就做為該次疊代的可能

中，一個較佳可用點(noninferior or optimal

設計，本研究案同時考量 L1-norm、L2-norm

用技巧可參考 Cortelazzo and Lightner (1984)
。此外，在串接式的最佳化數位 IIR 濾波器
設計，濾波器的穩定是必備的條件，因此，
數位濾波器的極點皆須位於單位圓內。依據
Jury 方法(1964)的推導，串接式的數位濾波
器的係數之限制條件如上述(1.13)式所示。 
本研究案利用所開發的演算法，來設計
最低階之串接式的數位 IIR 濾波器，並與過
去以基因演算法為基礎之研究者 Tang et al. 
(1998)的成果，以及與本計畫案主持人與其
學生(Tsai et al., 2006)所設計之串接式數位
IIR 濾波器，做性能上的比較。Tang et al. 
(1998)以及本計畫案主持人與其學生(Tsai et 
al., 2006)所設計的串接式數位 IIR 濾波器包
含低通濾波器(low-pass filter, LP)、高通濾波
器 (high-pass filter, HP) 、 帶 通 濾 波 器
(bandpass filter, BP) 、與帶止通濾波器
(bandstop filter, BS)。以上四種濾波器之設計
限制條件在通帶與止帶的頻率範圍如表 2
所述。 
本案例為參數設計最佳化問題中之數
位 IIR 濾波器設計，屬於相當複雜的多變數
與多目標最佳化問題，而且目標與目標之間
經常互相違背，如何建立一套好的演算法，
來設計出符合各目標之最佳 IIR 濾波器，是
每個研究者努力的目標。本研究案所開發之
演算法以達到所期望之設計目標，而且在性
能上具有優於先前研究者之演算法，以及優
於本計畫案主持人先前所提演算法之效益。 
（六）強健性混合免疫基因演算法 – 針對
數值類的問題 
本計畫案開發之強健性混合免疫基因
演算法，係結合免疫演算法、基因演算法、
及有效的實驗設計部份因子規劃表，來有系
統性且快速的解決數值最佳化問題。藉由免
疫演算法之超突變克隆機制產生多樣化的
子代，以避免基因演算法之早熟發生；並且
將實驗設計部份因子規劃法加入在混合免
疫基因演算法的交叉與突變之間，此目的在
於將部份因子實驗規劃法之系統推理能力
與交叉演算結合，來有效的選取較好的基因
產生新的子代，如此可強化混合免疫基因演
算法的能力，由於實驗部份因子設計法的加
入，使得強健性混合免疫基因演算法可擁有
穩健且有效的局部搜尋能力以及快速收斂
的特質。研究開發之強健性混合免疫基因演
算法流程圖如圖 1 所示。

可進一步改善本計畫案主持人近年來之國
科會計畫案的研究成果中仍然存在的早熟
收斂的問題，為增加更多的多樣性，可考量
增加免疫基因操作的超突變率。 
（二）以實驗設計來系統化推理產生優良子
代機制 
過去本計畫案主持人在執行 2005 年國
科會計畫案時，以及本計畫案主持人與其學
生(Liu et al., 2006)在處理組合最佳化的排
程類問題時，沒有一套有系統的重組步驟，
仍然需要用試誤法方式之隨機分段重組來
產生子代，因此無法有效的獲得最佳排程組
合。所以，本計畫案配合實驗設計法之部份
因子實驗規劃表，提出一種統一的系統化的
均勻交配方式，來推理重組產生不會有基因
衝突的優良子代，進而獲得最佳排程組合，
其步驟說明如下： 
步 驟 1 ： 設 定 1=i ； 產 生 一 集 合
{ }NU  , 3, 2, ,1 K= ，然後在部份因子
規劃表之前 N 行安置這 N 個工件
數。 
步驟 2：依部份因子規劃表上之“1＂或“2
＂，將集合U 區分成兩個子集合 1U
及 2U ，其中 φ=21   UU I ，以及
UUU =21   U 。 
步驟 3：如果父代染色體之第 i 個基因屬於
1U 者，則選取到新的子代染色體中
。 
步驟 4：如果母代染色體之第 i 個基因屬於
2U 者，則選取到新的子代染色體中
。 
步驟 5：如果 NMi ×> ，則到步驟 6；否則
，令 1+= ii ，然後重複步驟 3 至步
驟 5。 
步驟 6：計算新的子代染色體之適應值。 
（三）應用案例：零工式排程最佳化 
零工式排程問題的特性如下：有 M 台
機器與 N 個工件，每個工件分別有 M 個加
工次序，且每個加工次序需在不同的機器上
加工，工件 j 在機器 k 之處理時間為 tjk，其
中 j = 1, 2, …, N; k = 1, 2, …, M。此類問題的
最佳化目標為最小化在瓶頸機台上之最長
處理時間(makespan)。主要的假設條件如下
(Gen and Cheng, 1997)： 
z 每個工件在需被每台機台加工，但不
可在相同機台上重複加工。 
z 每台機器在同一時間僅能處理一個
工件。 
z 每個工件在同一時間僅能被一台機
器處理。 
z 加工過程不可中斷。 
z 加工次序沒有優先權，須依被規定的
次序進行。 
z 工件之安裝設定時間須包含於處理
時間內。 
z 不可有到期日的限制。 
在零工式排程問題有兩類的限制
條件，描述如下： 
(1)對一個工件加工先後次序的限制： 
設定 cjk 代表工件 j 在機器 k 
上的完工時間，tjk 為工件 j 在機器 k
之處理時間；對一個工件 i，假設先
在機台 h 加工，然後再到機台 k 加工
，則限制條件如下： 
ihiik ctc k ≥− ,     (2.1) 
(2)對一個工作機台上工作時間不可重
疊的限制： 
對於二個工件 i 與 j，需在同一
機台 k 在加工，假如工件 i 優先於工
件 j，則限制條件如下： 
.jkikjk tcc ≥−      (2.2)

TSAI AND CHOU: DESIGN OF OPTIMAL DIGITAL IIR FILTERS 4583
lems [16]–[18], [22]. However, the characteristics of the IAs
similar to those of the traditional GA, which is largely based
on the stochastic search techniques, have larger standard devia-
tions. A result is more robust if the relevant fitness values have
a smaller standard deviation. In this spirit, a natural question to
ask is whether the Taguchi method may play a role in attaining
more robust results, as the method has been well known to be
a robust design approach. Therefore, in order to seek an effi-
cient evolutionary algorithm such that the solution efficiency
for optimization problems can be further promoted, the pur-
pose of this paper is to propose a novel robust approach by
integrating the IAs and the Taguchi method. It is named the
Taguchi-immune algorithm (TIA) and can be used to solve the
problem of designing the optimal digital IIR filters. The Taguchi
method, a robust design approach, uses many ideas from statis-
tical experimental design for evaluating and implementing im-
provements in products, processes and equipment. The funda-
mental principle is to improve the quality of a product by mini-
mizing the effect of the causes of variation without eliminating
the causes. The two major tools used in the Taguchi method
are: i) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which measures quality, and
ii) orthogonal arrays which are used to study many design pa-
rameters simultaneously [27]–[32]. Based on the biological im-
mune principles and the Taguchi method, the TIA is established.
In the TIA, the clonal proliferation [33], [34] within hypermuta-
tion [35] for several antibody diversifications and the recombi-
nation by using the Taguchi method for the local search are in-
tegrated to improve the capabilities of exploration and exploita-
tion. The systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is
executed in the recombination operations to select the better an-
tibody genes to achieve the potential recombination, and con-
sequently enhance the TIA. Therefore, the integration of both
the clonal proliferation within hypermutation and the Taguchi
method for the recombination can improve the immune algo-
rithm, so that the TIA can be more robust, statistically sound,
and quickly convergent. Here, “more robust” means that the
standard deviation of the affinity values is relatively small by
using the proposed TIA approach.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
problem statement and the biological immune system. The
Taguchi-immune algorithm for designing the optimal digital
IIR filters is described in Section III. In Section IV, we first
evaluate the performance of the proposed TIA approach and
compare our results with those given by Leung and Wang [36]
and Tsai et al. [37] for some well-known test functions. Then,
we use the TIA approach to solve the design problems of the
digital IIR filters, and we also compare our results with those
given by Tang et al. [11] for the LP, HP, BP, and BS filters.
Finally, Section V offers some conclusions.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BIOLOGICAL IMMUNE SYSTEM
In this section, we state the problem and describe the biolog-
ical immune system.
A. Problem Statement
The traditional design of the IIR filter can be described by the
following recursive expression:
(2.1)
where and are the coefficients of the filter, and
are its input and output, and and are the number of
and filter coefficients, with . An equivalent transfer
function is described as follows:
(2.2)
The important task for the designer is to find values of and
which produce the desired response. A common way of real-
izing IIR filters is to cascade several first- and second-order sec-
tions together [10], [11]. Let denote the transfer func-
tion of a digital filter, where indicates the filter coefficients
(e.g., poles and zeros). The magnitude of is denoted as
. The fundamental structure of , regardless of
the filter type, can be given as [11]
(2.3)
where
denotes the filter parameters, and is a
positive normalizing constant such that the maximum value of
is 1.
Expression (2.3) considers the digital IIR filters with numera-
tors and denominators of the same degree. The discussion in this
paper can be also applied to the case of digital IIR filters with
numerators and denominators of different degree, if the obvious
changes are made.
The performances of the optimal digital IIR filter can be eval-
uated by using the -norm approximation error [2] and the
ripple magnitudes of both passband and stopband [6]. That is, to
proceed with the design optimally, the objective functions can be
specified in terms of the -norm approximation error and the
ripple magnitudes of both passband and stopband. The -norm
approximation error for the magnitude response is defined as [2]
(2.4)
where denotes the union of desired passband and stopband of
the desired filter, and denotes the magnitude target. In
general, the approximation criteria with 1 and 2 are more
popular for the filter design problems. They will be discussed in
more details as follows. In numerical work, it is convenient to
quantize the continuous problem by using fixed grid points [2].
The fixed grid approach is also adopted in this paper. The error
approximation function in (2.4) are rewritten as
and and (2.5)

for the invading antigen [40]. The selection and mutation occur-
rences in B-cell clonal proliferation processes admit these lym-
phocytes to increase their receptor diversity and to better their
capability of recognizing the selective antigens (increasing its
affinities with selective antigens).
In the immune system, the antibodies are produced in order
to cope with the antigen. As well as, the immune system pro-
duces diverse antibodies by recognizing the affinities between
antigens and antibodies. Based on some patterns of the biolog-
ical immune principles, the TIA is the algorithm that mimics the
antigen-antibody reaction of the immune system in mammals.
The antigen and the antibody in the TIA correspond to the objec-
tive function and the feasible solution, respectively. The hyper-
mutation mechanism of the clonal proliferation used in the TIA
plays a critical role in creating diverse antibodies. The clonal se-
lection principle of the TIA facilitates the efficiency of solving
the numerical optimization problems [18], [22].
III. TIA APPROACH FOR DESIGN OF IIR FILTERS
This section describes how to solve the multiparameter and
multicriterion optimization problem of designing the digital IIR
filters by using the TIA approach. The details are as follows.
1) Generation of Antibody Population: In the real coding
representation, each antibody is encoded as a vector of floating-
point numbers, with the same length as the vector of decision
variables. The real coding representation is accurate and effi-
cient because it is closest to the real design space, and, more-
over, the string length is the number of design variables. How-
ever, binary substrings representing each variable with the de-
sired precision are concatenated to represent an individual, and
the resulting string encoding a large number of design variables
would wind up a huge string length. For example, for 100 vari-
ables with domains in the range [ 500, 500] where a precision
of six digits after the decimal point is required, the length of the
binary solution vector is 3000. The algorithm would perform
poorly for such design problems.
We use the following parameter vector of the digital IIR filter
in (2.3):
(3.1)
as an antibody to represent a solution to the optimization
problem, where is the number of total filter parameters with
. Initialization procedure produces
antibodies, where denotes the antibody population size, by
the following algorithm.
Algorithm:
Step 1:Generate a random value , where  2[0,
1].
Step 2:Let x
i
= l
i
+ (u
i
  l
i
), where x
i
denotes
the ith element of x
1
in (3.1); l
i
and
u
i
are the lower and upper bounds of
x
i
, respectively. Repeat  times and
produce a vector (x
1
; x
2
; x
i
; . . . ; x

).
Step 3:Repeat the above two steps p
s
times and
produce p
s
initial feasible solutions.
2) Clonal Proliferation Within Hypermutation: Based on the
biological immune principles, the selection and mutation events
in B-cell clonal proliferation processes allow these lymphocytes
to increase their receptor diversity and to improve their capa-
bility of recognizing the selective antigens (increasing its affini-
ties with selective antigens). The hypermutation mechanism in
this study is derived from the convex set theory [41], [42]. The
antibody depending on the clonal selection rate is chosen

replication and the clonal proliferation to execute the recombi-
nation by using the matrix experiments of the orthogonal array.
The primary goal in conducting this matrix experiment is to de-
termine the optimal level for each factor. The optimal level for
a factor is the level that gives the highest value of in the
experimental region. For a two-level problem, if ,
the optimal level is level 1 for factor . Otherwise, level 2 is
the optimum one. After the optimal level for each factor is se-
lected, the new antibody is also obtained by combining those
levels from each factor. Therefore, by using the systematic rea-
soning ability of the Taguchi method, this new antibody has the
best or close-to-best evaluation value of the objective function
among those of combinations of factor level, where is
the total number of experiments needed for all combinations of
factor levels.
4) Mutation Operation: Similar to the hypermutation mech-
anism, the normal mutation operation is also derived from the
convex set theory [41], [42]. Each gene, in a single antibody,
depending on the mutation rate , executes the mutation of
convex combination.
5) Taguchi-Immune Algorithm: Based on the biological im-
mune principles and the Taguchi method, the artificial Taguchi-
immune algorithm is established. The steps of the TIA are de-
scribed as follows.
Step 0: Parameter setting.
Input: antibody population size , replication rate ,
clonal selection rate , hypermutation rate , muta-
tion rate , and number of generations.
Output: the optimal antibody and affinity value.
Step 1: Initial antibody population is generated using the
aforementioned Algorithm. The affinity values of the
antibody population are then calculated.
Step 2: Selection mechanism using the roulette wheel ap-
proach [43].
Step 3: Clonal proliferation within the hypermutation. The an-
tibody, depending on the clonal selection rate , is
chosen from the antibody population pool to join the
clonal proliferation. Each gene, in a single antibody,
depending on the hypermutation rate , executes the
hypermutation of convex combination.
Step 4: The reproduced antibodies, depending on the replica-
tion rate , are generated. Then, the antibodies, gen-
erated by the replication and the clonal proliferation,
are included to execute the recombination by using the
Taguchi method. The steps for the Taguchi-based re-
combination are given below from Steps 5 through 11.
Step 5: Select a suitable two-level orthogonal array for matrix
experiments.
Step 6: Choose randomly two antibodies at a time to execute
matrix experiments.
Step 7: Calculate the affinity values and SNRs of experi-
ments in the orthogonal array .
Step 8: Calculate the effects of the various factors ( and
).
Step 9: One optimal antibody is generated based on the results
from Step 8.
Step 10: Repeat Steps 6 through 9 until the expected number
(e.g., ) has been met.
Step 11: The antibody population via the Taguchi method is
generated.
Step 12: Mutation operation. Each gene, in a single antibody,
depending on the mutation rate , executes the mu-
tation of convex combination.
Step 13: New antibody population is generated.
Step 14: Sort the affinity values in increasing order among the
antibody population of last generation and the new an-
tibody population of current generation.
Step 15: Select the better antibodies as the new antibody pop-
ulation of the next generation.
Step 16: Has the stopping criterion been met? If yes, then go
to Step 17. Otherwise, return to Step 2 and continue
through Step 16.
Step 17: Display the optimal antibody and affinity value.
IV. DESIGN EXAMPLES AND COMPARISONS
First, in this section, we use the proposed TIA approach to
solve the global numerical optimization problems, evaluate the
performance of the proposed TIA approach, and compare our
results with those given by Leung and Wang [36] and Tsai et al.
[37] for some well-known test functions in Table I.

is the same as that used by the method in [11]. It can be seen that, for the LP, HP, BP, and BS filters, the filters obtained by using the TIA approach can give the
smaller absolute errors of magnitude responses than those obtained by using the method by Tang et al. [11] in both passband and stopband. (a) LP. (b) HP. (c) BP.

value given by the OGA/Q. In addition, each test function is per-
formed with 50 independent runs. The mean number of function
evaluations, the mean function value, and the standard deviation
of the function values are all recorded for each test function.
To identify any improvement on the TIA due to the Taguchi
method, we execute the IA to solve the test function, where the
computational procedures of the IA are the same as those of the
TIA, except that the Taguchi method is not used in the IA. For
the test function in Table I as an example, the mean numbers
of function evaluations using the TIA and the IA are, respec-
tively, 13267 and 249883, as the function value is equal to 0.
Fig. 2 shows the dynamic picture of the function value versus
function evaluations using the TIA and the IA for the test func-
tion . We can see that, from Fig. 2, the IA requires more func-
tion evaluations for the test function than the TIA, and hence
it has a larger time complexity. These results indicate that the
Taguchi method can effectively improve the IA.
Table II shows the performance comparisons the proposed
TIA, the HTGA, and the OGA/Q. From Table II, it can be seen
that
i) the proposed TIA and can find optimal or close-to-optimal
solutions;
ii) for , , and , the proposed TIA and the HTGA
can give better and closer-to-optimal solutions than the
OGA/Q, and for , , , and , the TIA, HTGA, and
OGA/Q all can give the same optimal solutions;
iii) the proposed TIA gives smaller standard deviations of
function values than the OGA/Q, and hence the proposed
TIA has a more stable solution quality;
iv) the proposed TIA requires fewer mean numbers of func-
tion evaluations than the HTGA and the OGA/Q, and
hence the proposed TIA has a lower computation time re-
quirement.
Furthermore, the execution of the proposed TIA can be
stopped for each run under the stopping criterion, so that the
standard deviation of function values for each function is 0. In
other words, these results in Table II indicate that the proposed
TIA can give better mean solution quality and more stable so-
lution quality than the OGA/Q, and the proposed TIA requires
fewer mean numbers of function evaluations than the HTGA

band correspond to higher performance [6], [14], the proposed
TIA approach can get better performances than the GA-based
method given in [11] for the digital IIR filters under the same
design criterion.
In the second case, the combination of two criteria, the ripple
magnitudes of passband and stopband is consid-
ered here. The two criteria are contrary generally. The computa-
tional results obtained by using the proposed TIA approach and
the GA-based method given by [11], respectively, are given in
Table V and shown in Fig. 4. The designed IIR filter models ob-
tained by the TIA approach are stated as shown in (4.9)–(4.12)
at the bottom of the previous page. From Table V and Fig. 4,
it can be seen that, for the LP, HP, BP, and BS filters, the pro-
posed TIA approach can give the smaller ripple magnitudes of
both passband and stopband than the GA-based method given
by Tang et al. [11]. That is, the proposed TIA approach under

approach can give the smaller absolute and square errors of magnitude responses and the better ripple magnitude performances than those obtained by using the
method in [11] in both passband and stopband. (a) LP. (b) HP. (c) BP. (d) BS.

The comparison results for the proposed TIA approach and the
classic methods given by Lam [50] are given in Table VII.
In a word, from these aforementioned results, we could
conclude that: i) the proposed TIA approach is superior to
the GA-based method presented by Tang et al. [11]; ii) the
proposed TIA approach for the design of digital IIR filers
allows each filter, whether it is LP, HP, BP, or BS filter, to be
independently designed; and iii) the proposed TIA approach
are very feasible to design the digital IIR filters, particularly
when the complicated constraints, the design requirements, and
the multiple criteria are all involved.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the TIA has been presented to solve the problem
of designing the optimal digital IIR filters. The clonal prolifer-
ation within hypermutation and the recombination by using the
Taguchi method are integrated to improve the capabilities of ex-
ploration and exploitation. The aforementioned hypermutation
of convex combination together with the high hypermutation
rate can give several antibody diversifications and is capable of
preventing the premature convergence. The Taguchi method is
a robust design approach, which draws on many ideas from sta-
tistical experimental design to plan experiments for obtaining
dependable information about variables, so it can achieve the
antibody population distribution closest to the target and make
the results robust. The two-level orthogonal array and SNR of
the Taguchi method are used for local exploitation. The sys-
tematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is executed in

Abstract
In this paper, by using the uniﬁed procedures, an improved immune algorithm named a modiﬁed Taguchi-immune
algorithm (MTIA), based on both the features of an artiﬁcial immune system and the systematic reasoning ability of
the Taguchi method, is proposed to solve both the global numerical optimization problems with continuous variables
and the combinatorial optimization problems for the job-shop scheduling problems (JSP). The MTIA combines the arti-
ﬁcial immune algorithm, which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit
the optimal antibody. In the MTIA, the clonal proliferation within hypermutation for several antibody diversiﬁcations and
the recombination by using the Taguchi method for the local search are integrated to improve the capabilities of explora-
tion and exploitation. The systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is executed in the recombination operations
to select the better antibody genes to achieve the potential recombination, and consequently enhance the MTIA. The pro-
posed MTIA is eﬀectively applied to solve 15 benchmark problems of global optimization with 30 or 100 dimensions. The
computational experiments show that the proposed MTIA can not only ﬁnd optimal or close-to-optimal solutions but can
also obtain both better and more robust results than the existing improved genetic algorithms reported recently in the lit-
erature. In addition, the MTIA is also applied to solve the famous Fisher-Thompson and Lawrence benchmarks of the
JSP. The computational experiments show that the proposed MTIA approach can also obtain both better and more robust
results than those evolutionary methods reported recently.

techniques [14], is less robust due to that the GA usually has larger standard deviations. In this spirit, a natural
question to ask is whether the Taguchi method may play a role in attaining more robust results, as the method
has been well known to be a robust design approach. The Taguchi method uses many ideas from the statistical
design of experiments for evaluating and implementing the improvements in products, processes, or equip-
ment. Its fundamental principle, largely speaking, is to improve the quality of concern by minimizing the eﬀect
of the causes of variation, but not eliminating the causes [32,34,29,31,37,47]. Tsai et al. [38] (the authors of this
paper) have applied the Taguchi method to improve the performance of the GA. This new algorithm proposed
by Tsai et al. [38] is named the HTGA, and it has been shown that the HTGA can obtain both better and more
robust results than the existing improved genetic algorithms reported recently in the literature [38]. Here it
should be noticed that in the work of Tsai et al. [38], the HTGA is a very eﬀective method to ﬁnd better oﬀ-
spring for the global numerical optimization problems, but, for the combinatorial optimization problems of
the JSP, the HTGA randomly divides the chromosome as the sections for the crossover to generate oﬀspring
[25]. This is not a systematic method, and thus the HTGA cannot guarantee that the oﬀspring is better than
their parents [25]. Therefore, it needs to further develop a systematic approach to improve the crossover
operation.
On the other hand, in the very recent years, there has been an ever-increasing interest in the area of the
artiﬁcial immune algorithm (AIA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, and their applications
[10–13,5,26,27]. Based on some patterns of the biological immune principles, the AIA is the algorithms that
mimic the antigen–antibody reaction of the immune system in mammals. The antigen and the antibody in
the AIA are, respectively, equivalent to the objective function and the feasible solution for a conventional opti-
mization method. However, the characteristics of the AIA similar to those of the traditional GA, which is lar-
gely based on the stochastic search techniques, have larger standard deviations. Recently, the authors of this
paper have proposed an improved immune algorithm, which integrates the AIA and the Taguchi method, to
design the digital one-dimensional inﬁnite-impulse-response ﬁlters [39], and have shown that the proposed
improved immune algorithm can obtain better results than the GA-based approaches. But, the improved
immune algorithm presented by the authors of this paper [39] cannot be directly used to solve the combina-
torial optimization problems of the JSP. On the other hand, in order to seek a uniﬁed optimal algorithm such
that the solution eﬃciency for both the global numerical optimization problems and the JSP can be further
promoted, the purpose of this paper is to modify our improved immune algorithm to an uniﬁed manner
for solving two kind of mentioned-above problems. It is named the modiﬁed Taguchi-immune algorithm
(MTIA) and can be used to solve both the global numerical optimization problems with continuous variables
and the JSP by using the uniﬁed procedures. In the proposed MTIA, the clonal proliferation [21] within hyper-
mutation [18] for several antibody diversiﬁcations and the recombination by using the Taguchi method for the
local search are integrated to improve the capabilities of exploration and exploitation. The systematic reason-
ing ability of the Taguchi method is executed in the recombination operations to select the better antibody
genes to achieve the potential recombination, and consequently enhance the MTIA. Therefore, the integration
of both the clonal proliferation within hypermutation and the Taguchi method can improve the AIA, so that
the MTIA can be more robust and quickly convergent.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problems deﬁnition. The modiﬁed Taguchi-
immune algorithm using the uniﬁed procedures for both the global numerical optimization problems and
the JSP is described in Section 3. In Section 4, we evaluate the eﬃciency of the proposed MTIA and compare
our results with those given by Leung and Wang [23] and Tsai et al. [38] for 15 benchmark problems with 30 or
100 dimensions and very large numbers of local minima. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the
proposed MTIA and compare our results with those given by Kim and Lee [22], Tsujimura et al. [42], Wang
and Zheng [45,46], and Liu et al. [25] for the famous Fisher-Thompson and Lawrence benchmark problems.
Finally, Section 5 oﬀers some conclusions.
2. Problems deﬁnition
In this section, we deﬁne both the global numerical optimization problem and the job-shop scheduling
problem.

[500, 500] where a precision of six digits after the decimal point is required, the length of the binary solution
vector is 3000. The algorithm would perform poorly for such design problems.
We use a vector (x1, x2, . . . ,xi, . . . ,xn) of the design variables as an antibody to represent a solution to the
numerical optimization problem. Initialization procedure produces ps antibodies, where ps denotes the anti-
body population size, by the following algorithm.
Step 1: Generate a random value b, where b 2 ½0; 1.
Step 2: Let xi ¼ li þ bðui  liÞ, where li and ui are, respectively, the lower and the upper bounds of xi. Repeat
n times and produce a vector (x1, x2, xi, . . . ,xn).
Step 3: Repeat the above steps ps times and produce ps initial feasible solutions.
For the JSP, the job-operation-based representation method, which uses the integer coding, is used to
encode a schedule as a sequence of jobs and operations. Each gene in a single antibody denotes each operation
of a job, and an antibody can be decoded into a schedule indirectly [42]. For example, there are three jobs
and each job has three operations. A nine-dimensional antibody vector OP as a schedule is constructed:
OP ¼ ð1; 1; 1; 2; 2; 2; 3; 3; 3Þ ¼ ðop11; op12; op13; op21; op22; op23; op31; op32; op33Þ, where, for example, op11 ¼
½1; 1; 3; 10, op12 ¼ ½1; 2; 2; 8, op13 ¼ ½1; 3; 1; 9, and so on. The ﬁrst gene ‘‘1’’ of OP is the ﬁrst operation of
job 1, which is performed on machine 3 and the processing time 10. The second gene ‘‘1’’ of OP is the second
operation of job 1, which is performed on machine 2 and the processing time 8. The third gene ‘‘1’’ of OP is the
third operation of job 1, which is performed on machine 1 and the processing time 9. The fourth gene ‘‘2’’ of
OP is the ﬁrst operation of job 2. The ﬁfth gene ‘‘2’’ of OP is the second operation of job 2, and so on.
Initialization is a process to generate new sequences of the antibody. The encoding scheme mentioned
above is a convenient tool to reproduce the initial population by using the swap-change method. The
swap-change method randomly changes the positions of jobs, and does not produce the conﬂict problem of
precedence. The initialization procedure produces ps feasible antibodies, where ps denotes the antibody pop-
ulation size, by the following algorithm:
Step 1: Create an initial antibody vector OP.
Step 2: Generate two integer values, a and c, by random, where both a and c belong to [1, M · N]. Execute
the swap-change in two genes of an antibody vector OP at the positions a and c.
Step 3: Repeat M · N times in Step 2 and then produce a new antibody OP.
Step 4: Repeat the above 1–3 steps ps times and then produce ps initial feasible solutions.
3.2. Clonal proliferation within hypermutation
Based on the biological immune principles, the selection and mutation events in B-cell clonal proliferation
processes allow these lymphocytes to increase their receptor diversity and to improve their capability of rec-
ognizing the selective antigens (increasing its aﬃnities with selective antigens). In solving the global numerical
optimization problems, the convex combination [2,14] is used as the hypermutation mechanism in this study.
The antibodies depending on the clonal selection rate pc, where pc is the probability of joining the clonal pro-
liferation of an antibody, are chosen from the antibody population pool to join the clonal proliferation. Each
gene, in a single antibody, depending on the hypermutation rate ph executes the hypermutation of convex
combination. In solving the global numerical optimization problems, for a given antibody x ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . ;
xi; xj; xk; . . . ; xnÞ, if the element xi is determined to execute the hypermutation and the other xk is randomly
selected to join in, the resulting oﬀspring antibody becomes x0 ¼ ðx1; x2; . . . ; x0i; xj; xk; . . . ; xnÞ, where the new
gene x0i is x0i ¼ ð1 bÞxi þ bxk, and b is a random value, in which b 2 ½0; 1.
In solving the JSP, the swap-change operation to maintain the high diversity of antibodies is used as the
hypermutation mechanism in this study. The antibodies depending on the clonal selection rate pc, where pc
is the probability of joining the clonal proliferation of an antibody, are chosen from the antibody population
pool to join the clonal proliferation. Each gene, in a single antibody, depending on the hypermutation rate ph
executes the hypermutation of swap-change operation.

L8ð27Þ is used as an illustrative example. The values (1 2 2 1) of the ﬁrst 4 columns of the 3rd experiment are
selected to divide the set U into two subsets U1 and U2. Thus, the subsets U1 and U2 are, respectively, {1, 4}
and {2, 3}. Then, the antibodies c1 and c2 are randomly chosen for executing the aforementioned Steps 1–6 to
complete the 3rd experiment of the matrix experiment, and the new antibody is generated from the underlined
numbers of the antibodies c1 and c2, as shown below:
U ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4g ( the elements of 4-jobs set U
ð1221Þ ( the values of the first 4 columns of
the 3rd experiment in L8ð27Þ
+
U 1 ¼ f1; 4g and U 2 ¼ f2; 3g
Antibody c1 ¼ ð1; 2; 2; 4; 3; 1; 3; 4; 2; 1; 3; 3; 2; 4; 1; 4Þ
Antibody c2 ¼ ð2; 1; 2; 4; 3; 1; 4; 4; 3; 1; 2; 2; 1; 4; 3; 3Þ
+
New Antibody ¼ ð1; 2; 2; 4; 3; 1; 4; 3; 1; 2; 2; 4; 1; 3; 4; 3Þ
In solving the global numerical optimization problems, the matrix experiment of the Taguchi method is
used to systematically donate the antibody genes from one antibody to the other one. The two antibodies
at a time are randomly chosen from the antibody pool generated by both the replication and the clonal pro-
liferation to execute the donation mechanism by using the matrix experiments of the orthogonal array. The
detailed steps, similar to the steps of solving the JSP, for each experiment of the matrix experiment are
described as follows:
Step 1: Set j = 1. Generate two sets U1 and U2, each of which has Q design factors (variables), and then take
the ﬁrst Q columns of the orthogonal array Lnð2n1Þ to allocate the Q design factors, where
nP Qþ 1.
Step 2: Two subsets U1 and U2 are, respectively, regarded as levels 1 and 2 by assigning two antibodies cho-
sen randomly from the population pool generated by the replication and the clonal proliferation.
Step 3: Assign the values of level 1 came from U1 and level 2 came from U2 to level cells of the j experiment in
the orthogonal array.
Step 4: Calculate the function value and signal-to-noise ratio for the new antibody.
Step 5: If j > n, then go to Step 6. Otherwise, j = j + 1, return to Step 3, and continue through Step 5.
Step 6: Calculate the eﬀects of the various factors (Ef1 and Ef2), where f ¼ 1; 2; . . . ;Q.
The primary goal in conducting these matrix experiments of solving the global numerical optimization
problems is to determine whether the gene, at each locus, of one antibody donates and replaces that of the
other one. One antibody will donate its genes to the other one as the Eﬂ has the highest value in the experi-
mental region. For a two-level problem, if Ef 1 > Ef 2, the optimal level is level 1 came from U1 for factor
f 2 ½1;Q. That is, the gene of locus f of one antibody donates to that of locus f of the other one. Otherwise,
the donation mechanism at locus f will not be happened. After the donation mechanism for each gene at each
locus is executed, the new antibody is also obtained. Therefore, by using the systematic reasoning ability of the
Taguchi method, this new antibody has the best or close-to-best evaluation value of the objective function
among those of 2Q combinations of factor level, where 2Q is the total number of experiments needed for all
combinations of factor levels.
3.4. Mutation
In solving the global numerical optimization problems, similar to the hypermutation mechanism, the muta-
tion operation also uses the convex combination [2,14]. Each gene, in a single antibody, depending on the
mutation rate pm executes the mutation of convex combination. For a given antibody vector

Step 0: Parameter setting.
Input: antibody population size ps, replication rate pr, clonal selection rate pc, hypermutation rate
ph, mutation rate pm, and number of generations.
Output: the number of objective function evaluations, the objective function values, and the stan-
dard deviations.
Step 1: Initial antibody population is generated using the aforementioned algorithm. The objective function
values of the antibody population are then calculated via the objective function. The number of func-
tion calls is calculated ps times.
Step 2: Selection mechanism using the roulette wheel approach [16].
Step 3: Clonal proliferation within the hypermutation. The antibody depending on the clonal selection rate
pc is chosen from the antibody population pool to join the clonal proliferation. Each gene, in a single
antibody, depending on the hypermutation rate ph executes the hypermutation of convex combina-
tion or swap-change operation.
Step 4: The reproduced antibodies depending on the replication rate pr are generated. Then, the antibodies
from the replication and the clonal proliferation are included to execute the recombination by using
the Taguchi method. The steps for the Taguchi-based recombination are given below from Steps 5
to 11.
Step 5: Select a suitable two-level orthogonal array for matrix experiments.
Step 6: Choose randomly two antibodies at a time to execute matrix experiments.
Step 7: Calculate the objective function values and signal-to-noise ratios of n experiments in the orthogonal
array Lnð2n1Þ.
Step 8: Calculate the eﬀects of the various factors ðEf 1 and Ef 2Þ.
Step 9: One optimal antibody is generated based on the results from Step 8.
Step 10: Repeat Steps 6–9 until the expected number 1

Step 11: The antibody population via the Taguchi method is generated. The number of function calls is cal-

array Lnð2n1Þ plus one run for the optimum antibody generated by signal-to-noise ratios.

number of function calls is calculated 1

problems.
Step 13: New antibody population is generated.
Step 14: Sort the objective function values in increasing order among the antibody population of last gener-
ation and the new antibody population of current generation.
Step 15: Select the better ps antibodies as the new antibody population of the next generation.
Step 16: Has the stopping criterion been met? If yes, the expected number of function calls is calculated

17. Otherwise, return to Step 2 and continue through Step 16.
Step 17: Display the number of objective function calls, the objective function values, and the standard
deviations.
4. Computational results and comparisons
In this section, by using the uniﬁed procedures, the MTIA is eﬀectively used to solve the two diﬀerent kinds
of problems, the global numerical optimization problems and the combinatorial optimization problems of the
JSP.
4.1. Global numerical optimization problems
Most researchers of the global numerical optimization have used the well-known test functions in Table 1
to test the performances of their improved-GAs [33,28,14,48,3,44,1,23,8,38,36,4,20]. From the obtained results
414 J.-T. Tsai et al. / Applied Mathematics and Computation 194 (2007) 406–424
In the works of Leung and Wang [23] and Tsai et al. [38], each test function was performed in 50 indepen-
dent runs and the following results were recorded: (i) the mean number and the standard deviation of function
evaluations, (ii) the mean function value (i.e., the mean of the function values was found in the 50 runs), and
(iii) the standard deviation of the function values. For the direct comparisons with the existing algorithms at
the convergence speed by using the mean number of function evaluations, the stopping criterion given below
is, therefore, used in the HTGA and MTIA approach. The stopping criterion is that the execution of the algo-
rithm would be stopped as soon as the smallest function value of the ﬁtness member of the population is less
than or equal to the mean function value given by the OGA/Q. On the other hand, the computation time is
sometimes used as an index for the evaluation of the convergent speed. It is not reasonable to use this index,
because the computation time depends on the diﬀerences of the computer hardware speciﬁcations, the oper-
ation system, the programming language, the individual programming skills, and so on. Therefore, the reason-
able criterion for evaluating the convergent speed is to use the number of function evaluations instead of the
computation time [23,38].
In this study, the evolutionary parameters are designed in two contrasting cases for the sake of the com-
parison with the HTGA and the OGA/Q. In the ﬁrst case, the MTIA uses the same evolutionary parameters

The evolutionary environments are designed to be the same parameter values for MTIA, HTGA, and OGA/Q except two parameters, the

only provide several antibody diversiﬁcations but can also prevent the premature convergence. In addition, it
can be seen from Table 3 that the rates of many operators have diﬀerent values for diﬀerent test functions. It
can be also seen from Table 3 that the mutation rate pm, the clonal selection rate pc, and the hypermutation
rate ph are set to be the diﬀerent values for diﬀerent test functions. It means that, for those test functions whose
solutions include quite broad ranges from the low-precision to the high-precision values, the mutation rate pm,
the clonal selection rate pc, and the hypermutation rate ph are more sensitive than the population size ps and
the replication rate pr. In the works of Chou et al. [7] and Hsieh et al.[19], they proposed that the Taguchi
method could be applied to ﬁnd the optimal evolutionary parameters in the GA such that the performance
of the GA can be improved. Therefore, in this study, the Taguchi method could be also used to adjust those
sensitive parameters as the way given by Chou et al. [7] and Hsieh et al. [19]. The Taguchi matrix experiment is
adopted to ﬁnd the optimal combination of these three parameters, the mutation rate pm, the clonal selection
rate pc, and the hypermutation rate ph, if the population size ps and the replication rate pr are ﬁxed, such that
the performance of the MTIA is promoted. We suppose that each of these three parameters has two levels in
every test function. The orthogonal array L4ð23Þ is chosen for this study, because three factors happen to equal

of the local search ability [43]. In addition, the systematic reasoning mechanism of the Taguchi method, i.e.,
the two-level orthogonal array and the signal-to-noise ratio, is executed in the recombination operations of the
MTIA to select the better antibody genes, achieve the recombination, and accelerate convergence to the global
solution. Besides, the AIA gives larger mean function value for each test function than the MTIA, and hence
the mean solution quality of the AIA is poorer to reach the global solution. Furthermore, the AIA gives larger

From Tables 7 and 8, it can be seen that, for the 10 · 10 FT and 20 · 5 FT problems of Fisher-Thompson
benchmarks,
(i) the proposed MTIA approach, the EVIS method given by Kim and Lee [22], the MGA method given by
Wang and Zheng [45,46], and the HTGA given by Liu et al. [25] can ﬁnd the optimal makespan, but the
average makespan obtained by using the proposed MTIA approach is better than those obtained by
using the EVIS, the MGA, and the HTGA methods;
(ii) the proposed MTIA approach can give the better makespan and the better average makespan than those
GA-based methods given by Tsujimura et al. [42];
(iii) the proposed MTIA approach gives smaller standard deviations of the makespan than those GA-based
methods given by Tsujimura et al. [42] and Liu et al. [25], and hence the proposed MTIA approach has a
more robust and stable solution quality.
On the other hand, in Table 9, we also compare the performance of the proposed MTIA approach with that
of the MGA method for some problems of the Lawrence benchmarks of the JSP, which are considered by
Wang and his associate [44–46]. For the LA16 and LA26 problems, both the MTIA and the MGA approaches
can ﬁnd the optimal makespan, but the MTIA approach can give the smaller average makespan than the
MGA method. In addition, for the LA16 and LA26 problems, the MTIA approach can reach the optimal
makespan in each run, i.e., the standard deviation is zero, but the MGA method did not discuss the problem
of the standard deviation. For the LA21 problem, the MTIA approach can give the smaller makespan and the
smaller average makespan than the MGA method, and it gives a quite small standard deviation. For the LA11
and LA31 problems, both the MTIA and the MGA methods can ﬁnd the optimal makespan in each run.
In a word, the computational experiments for the 10 · 10 FT and 20 · 5 FT problems of the famous Fisher-
Thompson benchmarks and for the famous Lawrence benchmarks of the JSP show that the proposed MTIA
approach can obtain both better and more robust results than those methods presented by Kim and Lee [22],

In the recent years, there has been an ever-increasing
interest in the area of the immune algorithm (IA) and their
applications [20–26]. The IA is the algorithm that mimics
the antigen–antibody reaction of the immune system in
mammals. The antigen and the antibody in the IA are
equivalent to the objective function and the feasible
solution for a conventional optimisation method. The
clonal selection principle of IA facilitates the efﬁciency of
solving the numerical optimisation problems [20, 24].
However, the characteristics of the IA similar to those of
the traditional GA, which is largely based on the stochastic
search techniques, have larger standard deviations. A
method is more robust if the relevant ﬁtness values have a
smaller standard deviation. The purpose of this paper is to
apply a novel robust approach by integrating the IA and
the Taguchi method. It is named the Taguchi-based IA
(TBIA) proposed by the authors of this work to solve the
optimal design problem of one-dimensional digital inﬁnite-
impulse-response ﬁlter [27]. Now, the TBIA is used and
modiﬁed to solve the digital 2D recursive ﬁlter design
problem. Based on the biological immune principles and
the Taguchi method, the TBIA is established. In the
TBIA, the clonal proliferation [28, 29] within
hypermutation [30] for several antibody diversiﬁcations and
the recombination by using the Taguchi method for the
local search are integrated to improve the capabilities of
exploration and exploitation. The systematic reasoning
ability of the Taguchi method is implemented in
recombination operations to select the better antibody
genes to achieve the potential recombination, and
consequently enhance the TBIA. Therefore the integration
of both the clonal proliferation within hypermutation and
the Taguchi method for the recombination can improve the
IA, so that the TBIA can be more robust and quickly
convergent.
The work is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the
problem statement. The problem solution by using the
TBIA for the digital 2D recursive ﬁlter design problem is
described in Section 3. In Section 4, we use the TBIA
approach to solve the digital 2D recursive ﬁlter design
problem and compare our results with those given by
Mladenov and Mastorakis [31], Mastorakis et al. [4] and
Gonos et al. [14]. Finally, Section 5 offers some conclusions.
2 Problem statement
In this section, we state the problem. For the design purpose,
we consider the following 2D transfer function for the ﬁlter
[4, 14, 31]
H (z1, z2) ¼ H0
PL
i¼0
PL
j¼0 aijz

k¼1 (1þ bkz1 þ ckz2 þ dkz1z2)
(1)
where aij, bk, ck and dk are the coefﬁcients of the ﬁlter, L and
K are orders of the numerator and denominator, respectively,
with K  L, H0 is a constant and a00 ¼ 1. Let us consider
Md, the desirable amplitude response of the 2D ﬁlter as a
function of the frequencies v1 and v2. The design task for
the designer is to ﬁnd a transfer function H(z1, z2) in (1)
such that the function M(v1, v2) ¼ H(ejv1, ejv2)
approximates the desired amplitude response Md (v1, v2),
where the frequencies v1, v2 [ [0, p] and z1¼ ejv1,
z2 ¼ ejv2. This approximation can be achieved by
minimising
J ¼ J (aij , bk, ck, dk, H0)

where p is a positive integer (usually p ¼ 1, 2 or 4), and N1
and N2 are the given positive integers.
Therefore the aim is to minimise the difference between
the actual and desired amplitude response of the ﬁlter at
N1N2 points. Since we are dealing with only ﬁrst-degree
factors in the denominator, it is known that the stability
conditions are given as following [1–3]
jbk þ ckj  1 , dk , 1 jbk  ckj (k ¼ 1, 2, . . . ,K ) (3)
Thus, the design of digital 2D recursive ﬁlters is equivalent to
the following constrained minimisation problem

where p is a positive integer (usually p ¼ 1, 2 or 4) andN1,N2
and K are the given positive integers.
3 Problem solution
The TBIA approach is applied and modiﬁed to solve the
design problem of the 2D recursive digital ﬁlters that have
the structure-speciﬁed form in the transfer function. In the
TBIA approach, the clonal proliferation within
hypermutation for several antibody diversiﬁcations and the
recombination by using the Taguchi method for the local
search are integrated to improve the capabilities of
exploration and exploitation. The keys to solving the digital
2D recursive ﬁlter design problem are as follows.

Taguchi method was applied to ﬁnd the optimal
evolutionary parameters in the GA such that the
performance of the GA can be improved. Therefore in
this study, we use the Taguchi method as the work of
Chou et al. [34] to adjust the parameters of evolutionary
environments. In the computational experiments of our
TBIA approach, the following parameters are used. The
antibody population size Npop is 200, the replication rate
pr is 0.8, the mutation rate pm is 0.1, the clonal
selection rate pc is 0.06, the hypermutation rate ph is 0.8
and the execution of the TBIA approach is stopped
when the smallest objective function value of the
antibody population cannot be further reduced in
the successive 50 generations after 200 generations. The
objective function is deﬁned in (6) with the constraints
(4b). By using our TBIA, we can ﬁnd the minimum of
J at different values of p (p ¼ 1, 2 and 4) as the point
to which the best values of our population converge.
The values of the best, the average and the standard
deviation in 30 independent runs on the 2D ﬁlter
design at different values of p (p ¼ 1, 2 and 4) by using
the TBIA approach are shown in Tables 1–3. The
computational results for J at different values of p
obtained by using the previous methods given by
Mladenov and Mastorakis [31], Mastorakis et al. [4]
and Gonos et al. [14] are also given in Tables 1–3. In

5 Conclusions
In this work, the TBIA has been applied to solve the problem
of designing 2D recursive digital ﬁlters. The clonal
proliferation within hypermutation and the recombination
by using the Taguchi method are integrated to improve the
capabilities of exploration and exploitation. The
aforementioned hypermutation of convex combination
together with the high-hypermutation rate can give several
antibody diversiﬁcations. The Taguchi method is a robust
design approach, which draws on many ideas from
statistical experimental design to plan experiments for
obtaining dependable information about variables, so it can
achieve the antibody population distribution closest to the
target and make the results robust. The systematic
reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is implemented in
the recombination operations to select the better antibody
genes to achieve the potential recombination, and
consequently enhance the TBIA. Therefore the proposed
TBIA approach possesses the merits of global exploration
and robustness. For the same 2D ﬁlter design example, the
computational experiments show that the TBIA approach
can obtain better results than those methods proposed by
Mladenov and Mastorakis [31], Mastorakis et al. [4] and
Gonos et al. [14]. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant advantage of
the TBIA approach over the methods given by Maria and
Fahmy [15], Charalambous [16], Rajan and Swamy [17],
Lu and Antoniou [3], Laasko and Ovaska [18] and Daniel
and Willsky [19] is that the design ﬁlter will be always
stable, because the TBIA can check the stability of the
design ﬁlter as constraints in the process of the algorithm.
Hence, we could conclude that the TBIA approach is very
feasible to design the 2D recursive digital ﬁlter.

Abstract 
For the finite-horizon optimal control problem of a class of time-varying Takagi-Sugeno 
(TS) fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems, by complementarily fusing the 
orthogonal-functions approach (OFA), the Taguchi-immune algorithm (TIA) and the 
delay-dependent stabilizability condition, an integrative method is presented to design the 
stable and quadratic-optimal fuzzy parallel-distributed-compensation (PDC) controllers. In 
this paper, the delay-dependent stabilizability condition is proposed in terms of linear matrix 
inequalities (LMIs). Based on the OFA, an algorithm only involving the algebraic 
computation is derived in this paper for solving the time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based 
time-delay feedback dynamic equations. By using the OFA and the LMI-based stabilizability 
condition, the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC control problem for a class of time-varying 
TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems is transformed into a static 
constrained-optimization problem represented by the algebraic equations with constraint of 
LMI-based stabilizability condition; thus greatly simplifying the quadratic optimal PDC 
control design problem. The computational complexity for both differential and integral in 
the stable and optimal PDC control design of the original dynamic systems may therefore be 
reduced considerably. Then, for the static constrained-optimization problem, the TIA can be 
easily employed to find the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC controllers for a class of  
time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems. The proposed integrative 
method fusing the OFA, the TIA and the LMI technique can be viewed as one of the 
hard-computing-assisted soft-computing category, where the OFA and the LMI technique 
belong to the hard computing constituents and the TIA is one of the soft computing 
constituents. A design example of the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC controllers for the 
pendulum time-delay system with the vibration in the vertical direction on the pivot point is 
given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed new integrative approach. 
 
4 
2004). Time delays are usually the source of instability and deteriorating performance of 
systems, and they are often encountered in various dynamic systems; therefore, recently, 
some researchers (see, for example, Cao and Frank, 2000, 2001; Er and Lin, 2002; Park et al., 
2003; Shin et al., 2003; Chen and Liu, 2005; Chang and Chang, 2006; Wang and Pan, 2007; 
Chen et al., 2008; Yoneyama, 2008; and the references therein) have paid their attention to 
study the stabilization problems of the time-invariant TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay 
control systems. On the other hand, only stabilization is often not enough in control system 
design. In control system design, it is often of interest to synthesize a quadratic-optimal 
controller such that the control objective of minimizing a quadratic integral performance 
criterion is achieved (Friedland, 1986; Goodwin et al., 2001). Hence, some researchers (Guan 
and Chen, 2004; Chou et al., 2006; Hou et al., 2006; Jiang and Han, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007, 
2008; and the references therein) recently have proposed some linear-matrix-inequality-based 
(LMI-based) approaches to design the quadratic-optimal parallel-distributed-compensation 
(PDC) controllers of the time-invariant TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems by 
minimizing the upper bound of a quadratic infinite-horizon integral performance index. The 
LMI-based approaches can be viewed as the hard computing (HC) approaches. 
For some time-varying nonlinear time-delay control systems, it is difficult to represent 
them into the time-invariant exact TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems by 
using the fuzzy membership functions to absorb the time-varying parts. That is, for some 
time-varying nonlinear time-delay control systems, we need to use the time-varying exact 
TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems instead of the time-invariant exact 
TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems to represent the time-varying nonlinear 
time-delay control systems. This will be demonstrated in the illustrative example given below 
in Section 4 of this paper. Besides, for some practical problems, we need to deal with the 
finite-horizon optimal control problems (Friedland, 1986; Goodwin et al., 2001). Thus, it is 
worth further studying for the problem of designing the quadratic-optimal PDC controllers of 
6 
control performance for a given dynamic system can be efficiently achieved, it is necessary 
that the given dynamic system can be stabilized by the controller (Nise, 2000). Hence, 
summing up the above statements and reasons, we can see that it is worth while to present an 
integrative approach fusing the SC, the HC and the stabilizability condition to find the stable 
and quadratic-optimal PDC controllers of the time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay 
control systems under the criterion of minimizing a quadratic finite-horizon integral 
performance index. 
The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrative method to design the stable and 
quadratic-optimal PDC controllers for the finite-horizon optimal control problems of a class 
of time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems by fusing the OFA, the 
Taguchi-immune algorithm (TIA) and the LMI technique, where the LMI technique is used to 
derive the delay-dependent stabilizability condition for ensuring that the closed-loop 
time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems can be stabilized. In this 
paper, by using the OFA and the LMI-based stabilizability condition, the 
dynamic-optimization problem of designing the quadratic-finite-horizon-optimal PDC 
controllers for the time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems is 
transformed into a static-optimization problem represented by the algebraic equations with 
constraint of LMI-based stabilizability condition; thus greatly simplifying the stable and 
quadratic-optimal PDC control design problem and facilitating the work of applying the IAs 
to solve the aforementioned dynamic-optimization problem. Here it should be noticed that, 
for the mentioned-above dynamic-optimization problem, the OFA or the LMI technique 
cannot be applied alone to find the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC controllers, and it is 
also difficult to only apply the IAs to find the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC controllers. 
So, in this paper, we complementarily fuse the OFA, the TIA and the LMI technique to solve 
the design problem to be studied. That is, for the solving the aforementioned 
dynamic-optimization problem, some internal data are first extracted from the TIA (master),

Proof: See Appendix. 
    However, only stabilizability is often not enough in control design. The control objective 
of directly minimizing a quadratic finite-horizon integral performance criterion for the 
dynamic systems is also considered in many practical control engineering applications 
(Friedland, 1986; Goodwin et al., 2001). On the other hand, before we are able to synthesize 
a controller such that the good control performance for a given dynamic system can be 
efficiently achieved, it is necessary that the given dynamic system can be stabilized by the 
controller (Nise, 2000). Therefore, the problem considered in this paper is how to specify the 
local feedback gain matrices iF  ( )Ni ,,2,1 K=  of the PDC controller in Eq. (3) such that (i) 
the constraint of LMI-based stabilizability condition in Eq. (5) for the closed-loop 
time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay dynamic system in Eq. (4) can be satisfied, 
and (ii) under an initial state condition ( ),0x  the optimal control performance for the 
time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay dynamic system in Eq. (2) can be achieved 
by minimizing the following 2H  quadratic finite-horizon integral performance index:

where the constant matrix W is the product-integration-matrix of two OF basis vectors (Ho 
and Chou, 2007). 
Now, if one set of local feedback gain matrices { }NFFF ,,, 21 L  is given, then ( )kx~  
( )1,,1,0 −= qk L  can be calculated from the following algorithm only involving the 
algebraic computation. 
Detailed Steps: Algebraic Algorithm 
Step 1: Give a small time interval ft  (i.e., specify the positive integer μ  via 
ft/τμ = ), the specified positive integer ,q  and the initial state vector ( ),0x  
and set .0=k  
Step 2: Calculate ( )( )fi tkzh for .,,2,1 Ni L=  
Step 3: Calculate ( )kxˆ  from Eq. (30). 
Step 4: Compute 1+kx  by using ( )( ) ( ) ( )( ).1~11 fkfk tkTxtkxx +=+=+  
Step 5: Set ,1+= kk  If ,1−> qk  then stop; otherwise go to Step 2. 
From the above algorithm, it is obvious that if one set of local feedback gain matrices 
{ }NFFF ,,, 21 L  is specified, then ( )kx~  ( )1,,1,0 −= qk L  can be determined, and thus the 
value of the performance index in Eq. (31) corresponding to this set of local feedback gain 
matrices { }NFFF ,,, 21 L  can be calculated. Given another set of local feedback gain 
matrices { },,,, 21 NFFF L  there obtains another value of the performance index in Eq. (31). 
That is, the value of the performance index in Eq. (31) is actually dependent on the set of 
local feedback gain matrices { },,,, 21 NFFF L  which means 
( ),,,, 112111 NpnfffGJ L=                        (32) 
where ijkf  ( ,,,2,1 Ni L=  pj ,,2,1 L=  and )nk ,,2,1 L=  denote the elements of the 
local gain matrices iF . Hence, the design problem of the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC 
20 
class of time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems, the static 
optimization problem becomes a static constrained-optimization problem represented by the 
algebraic equations with constraint of LMI-based stabilizability condition. This means that 
the main characteristic and contribution of this technique, bringing the OFA and the 
LMI-based stabilizability condition together, is that it reduces the mixed LMIH /2  PDC 
controllers design problem to that of solving a static constrained-optimization problem of 
algebraic form; thus greatly simplifying the mixed LMIH /2  PDC controllers design 
problem and facilitating the work of applying immune algorithms to solve the stable and 
quadratic-finite-horizon-optimal PDC controllers design problem. The proposed integrative 
method, that complementarily fuses the OFA, the TIA and the LMI-based stabilizability 
condition, belongs to the hard-computing-assisted soft-computing category, whose fusion 
grade is very high (Ovaska, 2005). For solving the aforementioned dynamic-optimization 
problem, some internal data are first extracted from the TIA, processed by the OFA algorithm 
and the LMI technique, and fed back into the TIA, which completes the primary task. 
The TIA combines the traditional immune algorithm (IA) (Dasgupta, 1999) with the 
Taguchi method (Taguchi et al., 2000; Wu, 2000). In the TIA, the clonal proliferation (Burnet, 
1959; Jerne, 1973) within hypermutation (Harris et al., 1999) for several antibody 
diversifications and the recombination by using the Taguchi method for the local search are 
integrated to improve the capabilities of exploration and exploitation. The systematic 
reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is executed in the recombination operations to select 
the better antibody genes to achieve the potential recombination, and consequently enhance 
the TIA. Therefore, the integration of both the clonal proliferation within hypermutation and 
the Taguchi method for the recombination can improve the immune algorithm, so that the 
TIA can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. Here, “more robust” 
means that the standard deviation of the affinity values is relatively small by using the 
22 
Step 5: Select a suitable two-level orthogonal array ( )12 −κκL  for the matrix 
experiments, where κ  denotes the number of experimental runs, and 1−κ  is 
the number of columns in the orthogonal array. The orthogonal array ( )78 2L  is 
used in the illustrative example given in the next section. 
Step 6: Choose randomly two antibodies at a time to execute matrix experiments. 
Step 7: Calculate the affinity values and SNRs (signal-to-noise ratio) of κ  experiments 
in the orthogonal array ( )12 −κκL  by using the Eq. (31) incorporated with the 
aforementioned algebraic algorithm. 
Step 8: Calculate the effects of the various factors. 
Step 9: One optimal antibody is generated based on the results from Step 8. 
Step 10: Repeat Steps 6 through 9 until the expected number (e.g., ( ) rs pp ××4/1 ) has 
been met. 
Step 11: The antibody population via the Taguchi method is generated. 
Step 12: Mutation operation. Each gene, in a single antibody, depending on the mutation 
rate ,mp  executes the mutation of convex combination. 
Step 13: New antibody population is generated.  
Step 14: Sort the affinity values in increasing order among the antibody population of 
last generation and the new antibody population of current generation. 
Step 15: Select the better sp  antibodies feasible for the constraint as the newantibody 
population of the next generation. 
Step 16: Has the stopping criterion been met? If yes, then go to Step 17. Otherwise, 
return to Step 2 and continue through Step 16. 
Step 17: Display the optimal antibody and affinity value.

Based on the approach of using the sector nonlinearity in the fuzzy model construction, 
both the fuzzy sets of premise part and the linear dynamic model of consequent part in the TS 
fuzzy model can be easily derived from the physical model of the given nonlinear dynamic 
system (Tanaka and Wang, 2001). This approach guarantees an exact fuzzy model 
construction for the given nonlinear dynamic model (Tanaka and Wang, 2001). The 
advantage of using the approach of sector nonlinearity is that there is no approximation error 
between the original nonlinear system and its TS-fuzzy-model-based system (Tanaka and 
Wang, 2001). So, in this example, we adopt the approach of sector nonlinearity (Tanaka and

In what follows, for the time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control system 
in Eq. (39), we will apply the proposed integrative approach, which fuses the OFA, the TIA 
and the presented LMI-based stabilizability condition, to find the stable and 
quadratic-optimal PDC controller such that there exist three symmetric positive definite 
matrices ,P  S  and Y  to make the LMIs in Eq. (5) hold (i.e., such that the stabilizability 
condition in Theorem is satisfied), and such that the quadratic finite-horizon integral 
performance index in Eq. (40) is minimized. The evolutionary environments of the TIA used 
in this paper are: the antibody population size is 100, the replication rate is 0.8, the mutation 
rate is 0.1, the clonal selection rate cp  is 0.06, the hypermutation rate hp  is 0.8, and the 
execution of the TIA approach is stopped when the smallest affinity value of the antibody 
population cannot be further reduced in the successive 50 generations after 500 generations. 
We employ the fuzzy PDC controller in Eq. (3), then, after using the proposed 
integrative approach and the LMI toolbox with 4=m  and 5≤ijkf  in which ijkf ( 2,1=i  
1=j  and )2,1=k  are the elements of the 21×  local feedback gain matrices iF  
( ),2,1=i  we can obtain that the performance index is ,3763.0=J  the local feedback gain 
matrices are [ ]1.2572-    0.9437-1 =F  and [ ],1.3099- 0.9869-2 =F  and three symmetric 
positive definite matrices are ,

⎡=Y  The responses of the angle ( )tx1  and the angular velocity ( )tx2  for 
28 
the LMI technique can be viewed as one of the hard-computing-assisted soft-computing 
category, where the OFA and the LMI technique belong to the hard computing constituents 
and the TIA is one of the soft computing constituents. In addition, the presented integrative 
approach, which fuses the OFA, the TIA and the LMI-based stabilizability condition, is 
non-differential, non-integral, straightforward, and well-adapted to computer implementation. 
Therefore, this proposed approach facilitates the design task of the stable and 
quadratic-optimal PDC controllers for a class of time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based 
time-delay control systems. The illustrative example of the pendulum time-delay system with 
vibration in the vertical direction on the pivot point has shown that the proposed integrative 
approach is effective to design the stable and quadratic-optimal PDC controllers for a class of 
time-varying TS-fuzzy-model-based time-delay control systems.

to solve this model. Their approach is applied to a real 
pairing system in Air France.  
Barnhart et al. [7] developed a heuristic methodology 
by using dual solutions determined in solving the linear 
programming relaxation of the crew pairing problem. 
Also, the deadhead selection procedure is tested and 
shown the significant improvement of crew costs by 
reducing deadhead hours and total duration of rest 
periods.  
Emden-Weinert and Proksh [8] modeled the aircrew 
problem as a run-cutting formulation and solved the 
problem using a simulated annealing approach. 
Experiments show the cost saving of the proposed 
approach.  
Yan and Chang [9] modeled the air crew pairing 
problem as a set partitioning problem. They used a 
column generation approach to solve the aircrew 
problem. Their model was applied to the real world 
cockpit crew scheduling problem. 
 
3. MATHEMATICAL MODELS 
 
3.1 Permutation-based Model 
To overcome the time-consuming enumeration 
problem in the traditional set-partition model [10], a 
novel 2-dimensional form of candidate solutions is 
proposed.

where S is a two-dimensional matrix with D Eu   
elements, D  is the maximum possible number of crew 
pairs, E  is the maximum possible number of flights 
assigned to one pair, and each si,j represents a flight 
identifier which means the j-th flight assigned to the i-th 
group of crew member. To keep the number of flights 
assigned to each group identical, we assign dummy 
flights with flight identifier -1. 
The main feature of the proposed model is that the 
number of pairings becomes a controllable variable 
instead of unexpected value within the range 
 in the set-partition model [10] where 0 2 1JPd d  P  
is the number of possible pairing combinations, and J  
is the number of flights. 
. This is useful for practical use when performing real 
pairing process since the number of pairing is related to 
the manpower in the airline company. 
 
3.2 Objectives 
The goal of aircrew pairing problem is to minimize 
the total cost. To minimize the total cost is equivalent to 
minimizing the following objective functions, such as 
ground transition time, number of deadheading crew, 
number of layover, flying time, and flight duty period, 
are described as follows. 
Suppose that for each flight i, ˆ ip denotes as the 
original airport, ˆ ip denotes as the destination airport,  
denotes as the departure time, and 
iˆt
it  denotes as the 
arrival time. The various objectives can be formulated 
as follows: 
Transition time objective ensures that each aircraft 
has sufficient ground turn-around time not less than the 
legal ground turn-around time, denoted as xT , to be 
allowed for the subsequent flight. The objective is 
defined as the following:

4.3 Encoding Schema 
The encoding scheme of each individual is a 
two-dimensional matrix. To make the encoding more 
efficiency, we transform the chromosome to a string. To 
satisfy the objective of working hour, we use a modified 
approach to reduce the complexity on solving the 
working hour objective. In each individual, the flights 
that are earlier than time t are allocated in the left-hand 
side of the individual. On the other aspect, the flights 
that are later than time t are put in the right-hand-side of 
the individual shown in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 2 Definitions of a sequence of flights. 
 
As shown in Fig. 2, there are E  flights. The earlier 
and later flights are represented as gray, and dark gray 
rectangles. Furthermore, the former and the later half 
flights can be called the upper and the lower sections. 
The encoding scheme of each individual transforms the 
two-dimensional matrix into a one-dimensional array, as 
illustrated in Fig. 3. 
Fig. 3 Example of 1-dimensional string encoding of 
original 2-dimensional chromosome. 
 
4.4 Selection 
The rank selection is adopted to select the best fitting 
individuals of the population into a mating pool. This 
method decides the selected probability of a 
chromosome depending on the fitness order (its position 
after being sorted) in the population and not on the 
absolute fitness value. It can thus avoid the imperfect 
fitness scale for different-level constraint violation or 
non-normalized objectives relative to the roulette wheel 
selection. 
 
4.5 Crossover and Mutation 
In the crossover process, we use an order-based 
crossover. First, a 0-1 random mask string is generated 
to determine which flights are fixed on original 
positions, and which flights are selected to be changed. 
If the i-th element of the generated mask is 1, then the 
j-th gene of offspring1 is fixed on original position. 
Otherwise, it will be replaced. As shown in Fig. 4, the 
fixed genes, which are white rectangles on offspring 1 
and 2 will be kept on the original positions. 
 
Fig. 4 The order-based crossover operator. 
According to Fig. 4, the genes to be replaced on each 
offspring are in the following order: 
Parent1: AĺBĺCĺDĺEĺFĺGĺH 
Parent 2: DĺAĺFĺHĺCĺEĺGĺB 
After the process of crossover, the orders of the genes 
are exchanged according to the following order: 
Offspring1: DĺAĺFĺHĺCĺEĺGĺB 
Offspring2: AĺBĺCĺDĺEĺFĺGĺH 
 
4.6 Repair Strategy 
As mentioned in the previous section, this study 
indicates that the flights assigned to each group of crew 
members in random sequence by genetic algorithms 
may result in a temporary solution with high violation 
values, since some flights with earlier departure times 
are arranged after ones with later departure time. Such a 
solution has to be repaired to reduce the number of 
violations on the ground turn-around time objective. 
Therefore, the repairing strategy is adopted to reorder 
all flights according to their departure times for each

challenge is that an algorithm may be trapped in the local 
optima of the objective function when the dimension is high 
and there are numerous local optima [5]. Among the 
existing optimization algorithms, the differential evolution 
algorithm (DEA) has received considerable attention 
regarding its potential as a novel optimization technique for 
complex problems and has been successfully applied in 
various areas [6]-[13]. The main specific feature of the DEA 
as an optimization method is its implicit parallelism, which 
is a result of the evolution and the hereditary-like process. 
Therefore, Chang [14] used the DEA to solve the parameter 
identification problem of Chen and Lü chaotic systems. 
Here it should be noticed that, to the authors’ best 
knowledge, only the literature presented by Chang [14] 
studied the issue of using the DEA to find the parameters of 
Chen and Lü chaotic system. Therefore, in this paper, we 
propose a novel Taguchi-sliding-level differential evolution 
algorithm (TSLDEA) for finding the actual parameters of 
Chen and Lü chaotic systems. The TSLDEA, a powerful 
global exploration capability, combines the DEA with the 
Taguchi-sliding-level (TSL) method [15]. The Taguchi 
method, a robust design approach, uses many ideas from the 
statistical experimental design for evaluating and 
implementing improvements in products, processes and 
equipment. The fundamental principle is to improve the 
quality of a product by minimizing the effect of the causes 
of variation without eliminating the causes. The two major 
tools used in the Taguchi method are: (i) signal-to-noise 
ratio which measures quality, and (ii) orthogonal arrays 
which are used to study many design parameters 
simultaneously [16], [17]. Chou (the fourth author of this 
paper) and his associates have applied the Taguchi method 
to improve the performance of genetic algorithm (GA) 
named the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) and 
shown that the HTGA may obtain both the better and the 
more robust results than those existing improved GAs 
reported in the literatures [18].  
Therefore, the TSL method is fused in the crossover 
operation of a DEA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability 
of the TSL method is incorporated in the crossover operation 
to select the better trial vector to achieve the crossover 
operation of a DEA, and consequently enhance the DEA. 
Thus, the TSLDEA can be more robust, statistically sound, 
and quickly convergent. The purpose of this paper is, by 
using the TSLDEA for finding the actual parameters 
between the real Chen and Lü chaotic systems and the 
predictive Chen and Lü chaotic systems, to investigate the 
promoted effectiveness of DEA. 
II. PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION OF CHEN AND LÜ 
CHAOTIC SYSTEM USING TSLDEA 
The Chen chaotic dynamic system and the Lü chaotic 
dynamic system [2] with three state differential equations are 
described, respectively, as  ( ) ( ) ( )( ),1211 txtxtx −= α&                                         (1a) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),23311132 txtxtxtxtx ααα +−−=&             (1b) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),32213 txtxtxtx α−=&                                     (1c) 
and 
( ) ( ) ( )( ),1211 txtxtx −=α&                               (2a) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),23312 txtxtxtx α+−=&                        (2b) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),32213 txtxtxtx α−=&                          (2c) 
where ( )txi  ( )3,2,1=i  denotes the state variable, and the 
actual parameters ,1α  2α  and 3α  are the positive constants 
for the Chen and Lü chaotic dynamic systems. In addition, 
the estimated chaotic models, which are expected to match 
the actual Chen dynamic system (1) and the actual Lü 
dynamic system (2), respectively, are given by 
( ) ( ) ( )( ),ˆˆˆˆ 1211 txtxtx −=α&                                          (3a)

and 
( ) ( ) ( )( ),ˆˆˆˆ 1211 txtxtx −=α&                               (4a) 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),ˆˆˆˆˆ 23312 txtxtxtx α+−=&                       (4b) 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),ˆˆˆˆˆ 32213 txtxtxtx α−=&                         (4c) 
where ( )txiˆ  ( )3,2,1=i  denotes the estimated state variable, 
and the estimated parameters ,ˆ1α  2αˆ  and 3αˆ  are the 
positive constants for the Chen and Lü chaotic dynamic 
systems. It is wished that these model parameters are 
accurately solved to approximate the actual parameters ,1α  
2α  and ,3α  respectively, according to the proposed 
TSLDEA. 
On the other hand, the estimated parameters iαˆ  ( )3,2,1=i  have a major impact on the Chen and Lü chaotic 
dynamic systems in Eqs. (3) and (4). Thus, the performance 
index J can be defined as  
( ) ( )( ) ,ˆ3

2∑∑

−=
i
T
n
ii nxnxJ                           (5) 
where n is referred to as the sampling time point and T is the 
total number of sampling.  
It is obvious that if one set of estimated parameters { }321 ˆ,ˆ,ˆ ααα  is specified, then ( )txiˆ  ( )3,2,1=i  in Eqs. (3) 
and (4) can be determined, and thus the value of the 
performance index J in Eq. (5) corresponding to this set of 
estimated parameters { }321 ˆ,ˆ,ˆ ααα  can be calculated. Given 
another set of estimated parameters { },ˆ,ˆ,ˆ 321 ααα  there 
obtains another value of the performance index J in Eq. (5). 
That is, the value of the performance index J in Eq. (5) is 
actually dependent on the set of estimated parameters { },ˆ,ˆ,ˆ 321 ααα  which means ( ).ˆ,ˆ,ˆ 321 αααfJ =                                  (6) 
Hence, the parameter identification problem of the Chen 
and Lü chaotic dynamic systems are to search for the optimal 
iαˆ  ( )3,2,1=i  such that the performance index J in Eq. (5) 
is minimized. This is equivalent to the optimization problem 
min ( )321 ˆ,ˆ,ˆ αααfJ =                             (7)

to solve this model. Their approach is applied to a real 
pairing system in Air France.  
Barnhart et al. [7] developed a heuristic methodology 
by using dual solutions determined in solving the linear 
programming relaxation of the crew pairing problem. 
Also, the deadhead selection procedure is tested and 
shown the significant improvement of crew costs by 
reducing deadhead hours and total duration of rest 
periods.  
Emden-Weinert and Proksh [8] modeled the aircrew 
problem as a run-cutting formulation and solved the 
problem using a simulated annealing approach. 
Experiments show the cost saving of the proposed 
approach.  
Yan and Chang [9] modeled the air crew pairing 
problem as a set partitioning problem. They used a 
column generation approach to solve the aircrew 
problem. Their model was applied to the real world 
cockpit crew scheduling problem. 
 
3. MATHEMATICAL MODELS 
 
3.1 Permutation-based Model 
To overcome the time-consuming enumeration 
problem in the traditional set-partition model [10], a 
novel 2-dimensional form of candidate solutions is 
proposed.

where S is a two-dimensional matrix with D Eu   
elements, D  is the maximum possible number of crew 
pairs, E  is the maximum possible number of flights 
assigned to one pair, and each si,j represents a flight 
identifier which means the j-th flight assigned to the i-th 
group of crew member. To keep the number of flights 
assigned to each group identical, we assign dummy 
flights with flight identifier -1. 
The main feature of the proposed model is that the 
number of pairings becomes a controllable variable 
instead of unexpected value within the range 
 in the set-partition model [10] where 0 2 1JPd d  P  
is the number of possible pairing combinations, and J  
is the number of flights. 
. This is useful for practical use when performing real 
pairing process since the number of pairing is related to 
the manpower in the airline company. 
 
3.2 Objectives 
The goal of aircrew pairing problem is to minimize 
the total cost. To minimize the total cost is equivalent to 
minimizing the following objective functions, such as 
ground transition time, number of deadheading crew, 
number of layover, flying time, and flight duty period, 
are described as follows. 
Suppose that for each flight i, ˆ ip denotes as the 
original airport, ˆ ip denotes as the destination airport,  
denotes as the departure time, and 
iˆt
it  denotes as the 
arrival time. The various objectives can be formulated 
as follows: 
Transition time objective ensures that each aircraft 
has sufficient ground turn-around time not less than the 
legal ground turn-around time, denoted as xT , to be 
allowed for the subsequent flight. The objective is 
defined as the following:

Deadheading crew objective ensures that the arrival 
airport of si,j is the same with the departure airport of 
si,j+1 for each aircraft in S. This objective is to reduce the 
extra cost of the nonprofit flight. The objective can be 
defined as the following:

constraint violation. 
Step 5:  Evaluate the auxiliary perform index vector 
of each individual S(t) in entire population n.  
Step 6:  Apply improved rank-based fitness 
assignment method to calculate the fitness of 
each individual S(t). 
Step 7.  If the number of current generation t reaches 
g, or all the objectives are satisfied, then stop 
the algorithm. 
Step 8.  Choose two individuals using the tournament 
selection method. 
Step 9.  Perform crossover and mutation operators to 
generate the populations of next generation 
t+1 in the mating pool . The mutation 
operator randomly selects two flights in the 
chromosome and exchanges their positions.

4.3 Encoding Schema 
The encoding scheme of each individual is a 
two-dimensional matrix. To make the encoding more 
efficiency, we transform the chromosome to a string. To 
satisfy the objective of working hour, we use a modified 
approach to reduce the complexity on solving the 
working hour objective. In each individual, the flights 
that are earlier than time t are allocated in the left-hand 
side of the individual. On the other aspect, the flights 
that are later than time t are put in the right-hand-side of 
the individual shown in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 2 Definitions of a sequence of flights. 
 
As shown in Fig. 2, there are E  flights. The earlier 
and later flights are represented as gray, and dark gray 
rectangles. Furthermore, the former and the later half 
flights can be called the upper and the lower sections. 
The encoding scheme of each individual transforms the 
two-dimensional matrix into a one-dimensional array, as 
illustrated in Fig. 3. 
Fig. 3 Example of 1-dimensional string encoding of 
original 2-dimensional chromosome. 
 
4.4 Selection 
The rank selection is adopted to select the best fitting 
individuals of the population into a mating pool. This 
method decides the selected probability of a 
chromosome depending on the fitness order (its position 
after being sorted) in the population and not on the 
absolute fitness value. It can thus avoid the imperfect 
fitness scale for different-level constraint violation or 
non-normalized objectives relative to the roulette wheel 
selection. 
 
4.5 Crossover and Mutation 
In the crossover process, we use an order-based 
crossover. First, a 0-1 random mask string is generated 
to determine which flights are fixed on original 
positions, and which flights are selected to be changed. 
If the i-th element of the generated mask is 1, then the 
j-th gene of offspring1 is fixed on original position. 
Otherwise, it will be replaced. As shown in Fig. 4, the 
fixed genes, which are white rectangles on offspring 1 
and 2 will be kept on the original positions. 
 
Fig. 4 The order-based crossover operator. 
According to Fig. 4, the genes to be replaced on each 
offspring are in the following order: 
Parent1: AĺBĺCĺDĺEĺFĺGĺH 
Parent 2: DĺAĺFĺHĺCĺEĺGĺB 
After the process of crossover, the orders of the genes 
are exchanged according to the following order: 
Offspring1: DĺAĺFĺHĺCĺEĺGĺB 
Offspring2: AĺBĺCĺDĺEĺFĺGĺH 
 
4.6 Repair Strategy 
As mentioned in the previous section, this study 
indicates that the flights assigned to each group of crew 
members in random sequence by genetic algorithms 
may result in a temporary solution with high violation 
values, since some flights with earlier departure times 
are arranged after ones with later departure time. Such a 
solution has to be repaired to reduce the number of 
violations on the ground turn-around time objective. 
Therefore, the repairing strategy is adopted to reorder 
all flights according to their departure times for each
