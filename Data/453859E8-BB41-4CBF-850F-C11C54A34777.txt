generation system for new services. A major trend in 
the mobile systems industry is the push for higher 
data rates while maintaining high spectral 
efficiency. This is achieved by using higher order 
modulation like hybrid phase-shift keying (HPSK). To 
support the popular quad-band mobile communication 
networks from second-generation (2G) to third-
generation (3G), seven different RF power amplifiers 
(PAs) are currently required to be integrated into 
one mobile phone. This sub-project focuses on the 
development of the highly-efficient RF power 
amplifier (PA), the core circuit of the proposed 
multi-standard mobile phone polar transmitter, to 
support 2G and 3G wireless communication standards by 
replacing two or more PAs in handsets. If much fewer 
RF PAs are required to be integrated into one mobile 
phone with the same functionality, the complexity of 
integration and cost of manufacture could be 
significantly reduced. 
To increase radio cellular PA efficiency and 
linearity has been in focus for radio technology 
research for many years. Highly-efficient switching-
mode RF power amplifiers combined with digital pre-
distortion (DPD) linearization is now established as 
the primary technology of choice in demanding mobile 
communication applications. However, digital pre-
distortion normally leads to increased power 
consumption and circuit complexity. Therefore, the 
architecture of the proposed pulse-modulated polar 
transmitter (PMPT) was proposed and used by including 
the highly-efficient switching or overdriven PAs from 
this sub-project. In order to achieve better system 
efficiency and reliability, the GaAs heterojunction 
field-effect transistors (HJ-FETs), enhancement-mode 
pseudo- morphic high electron-mobility transistors 
(pHEMTs), and surface mounted devices (SMDs) will be 
used for designing PAs combined the proposed wide 
output dynamic-range technique to enhance the average 
efficiency and reliability of the RF PAs.

前言 
The PA efficiency drops drastically in back-off as indicated in Fig. 1 [1]. This is a significant 
problem for cellular transmitters that operate with signals having large envelope variations. 
Peak-to-average ratio (PAR) is used as a measure to quantify the signals envelope variations. WCDMA 
and CDMA2000 modulation have practical PAR values of approximately 3.5–9 dB, as shown in Table I. 
By using PAR reduction schemes, like clipping, the actual PAR can be reduced, the actual value will 
depend on EVM and spectrum purity requirements. Clipping will however increase the signal EVM and 
is thus clearly a limiting factor when using higher order modulation. Therefore, a linear-amplification 
architecture, namely the pulse-modulated polar transmitter (PMPT), was proposed to support large PAR 
modulation schemes and wide bandwidth signals. The highly-efficient switching or overdriven PA is 
suitable for the PMPT because the proposed architecture is based on the envelope elimination and 
restoration (EER) approach. It is common knowledge that the power loss in the output side of PA cannot 
be reduced by increasing the gain of the PA. For this reason, the insertion loss and port-to-port isolation 
are very important parameters of output power combiners for the highly-efficient PAs.

文獻探討 
The highly-efficient class-E PAs, first proposed by Sokal in [2], were adopted for the polar 
transmitter. Ideally, the class-E power amplifier is also capable of achieving a 100% efficiency. Fig. 2 is 
the single-ended class-E PA architecture. Due to the non-overlapped property in ideal operation between 
the voltage and current swings, the actual switching loss of power transistors, namely VDS ·IDS at the same 
time, is small, as shown in Fig. 3. This is the big difference compared to a hard-switching class-D, where 
a parasitic switch capacitance will always lead to power dissipation and a reduction of the efficiency. In 
class-E, the switch is closed when the voltage becomes zero and therefore no switching losses occur. This 
is also referred to as soft switching or zero voltage switching, (ZVS). In fact, the parasitic capacitance of 
the switch can become part of Cd in Fig. 2. In other words, the parasitic drain-source capacitance can 
become part of the amplifier circuit. Moreover, the efficiency of the class-E power amplifier is 
independent of the supply voltage and thus, changing the power supply of a class-E power amplifier is an 
efficient means to change the amplitude of the output RF signal.

研究方法 
Class-E Power Amplifier 
The circuit schematic diagram of the designed RF power amplifier is shown in Fig. 4. Commercially 
available GaAs heterojunction field-effect transistors (HJ-FETs) were used to design the PA module. The 
parasitic capacitance CDS was absorbed in CP as part of the class-E output network. The parasitic 
capacitance compensation technique in [9] was applied to resonate out the parasitic capacitance, CGS, to 
improve the efficiency and envelope response time of the RF PAs. CG serves as a part of the input 
resonant network and as a DC block. The gate voltage is applied through the resistor, RG, which also 
improves the PA’s stability. Fig. 5 shows the simulated transient waveforms of the drain voltage, VD, and 
the drain current, ID, of the transistor with a continuous-wave (CW) input signal at 900 MHz. The pull-up 
of the drain voltage is delayed until the drain current drops significantly away from its peak value.

Miniaturized 3-dB Branch-Line Hybrid Coupler With Harmonics Suppression 
A conventional 3 dB branch-line hybrid coupler consists of two pairs of λ/4 transmission lines with 
characteristic impedances of 35.35 Ω and 50 Ω, and its size is determined by the guided wavelength of 
the transmission line, which is usually too large physically, especially at low frequencies. It is possible to 
reduce the physical length of a transmission line by using an equivalent π topology as proposed in [11], 
[12]. The hybrid coupler design using this technique results in four size-reduced transmission lines with 
four shunt-to-ground capacitors, and the overall coupler size can be reduced effectively. 
The addition of parallel capacitors shunt with the transmission lines is proposed to further reduce the 
physical size of the transmission line hybrid. Fig. 8(a) shows the transmission line with a characteristic 
impedance Z0 and physical length l1, whereas Fig. 8(b) shows the parallel structure of the capacitor CP 
and high impedance transmission line with the characteristic impedance of ZP and physical length of l2. 
Using the admittance matrices, the two simultaneous equations can be derived as 
      (1) 
and 
      (2) 
where β is the propagation constant. Assuming l1 = λ/4, βl1 = 90°, and ZP / Z0 = X, l2 and CP can be derived 
    9 
Miniaturized 3-dB Lumped-elements Wilkinson Combiner/Splitter 
The theory of lumped-elements Wilkinson power combiner or splitter is that using the equivalent 
π-model or T-model of the lumped elements to treat as each transmission line in the Wilkinson power 
combiner or splitter shown in Fig. 10 for reducing the occupied area and making the design easily 
[13]-[15]. According to the transmission-line theory, the ABCD matrix of a transmission line with the 
length of L and the characteristic impedance of Z0 can be derived as 
      (5) 
where β = 2π / λ. When L = λ/4, namely βL = 90°, the equivalent ABCD matrix can be derived as 
      (6) 
Moreover, as L = 3λ/4, namely βL = 270°, the equivalent ABCD matrix can be derived as 
      (7) 
However, the π-model of low-pass network shown in Fig. 11(a) can be represented in the ABCD matrix as 
      (8) 
Similarly, the T-model of low-pass network shown in Fig. 11(b) can be represented in the ABCD matrix 
as 
      (9) 
Solving the XL and BC using the equations (6) and (8) or the equations (6) and (9), the solution is XL = Z0 
and BC = Y0 showing that the two models in Fig. 11 could be used to stand for the λ/4 transmission line.

研究成果 
The research of this sub-project should lead to the construction of the highly-efficient power 
amplifier modules for a complete multi-standard polar transmitter system that can support most of the 
widely used mobile wireless communication standards such as GSM, EDGE, WCDMA, and CDMA2000. 
A mobile wireless communication product utilizing this transmitter should have much longer batter life 
and significantly lower cost than conventional ones. It would also be more convenient for end users since 
it would not require the users to change products when travelling abroad. 
 
Implementation of Class-E Power Amplifiers in Proposed PMPT Modules 
The output power requirement of CDMA class III mobile station is 0.2 watt, or 23 dBm. Therefore, 
the transmitter should deliver at least 26-dBm modulated output power to compensate for the typical 
2~3-dB insertion loss of a SAW filter. For this reason, two class-E PAs were used to achieve the desired 
output power level with the Wilkinson power splitter and combiner at their respective inputs and outputs. 
An RF switch was used as the pulse modulator. When the switch is opened, both ports of the switch are 
connected to 50 ohm terminations. It helps to avoid instability issues caused by floating the PA’s input 
node. The PA module, Wilkinson power splitter and combiner, and pulse modulator are all developed on 
two-layer FR4 printed circuit boards. The polar transmitter module is shown in Fig. 14.

Implementation of Overdriven Class-C Power Amplifiers in Proposed PMPT Modules 
As shown in Fig. 19, the class-C PA was developed using commercially available enhancement- 
mode pHEMTs, surface-mount inductors, and surface-mount capacitors. Fig. 20 shows the measurement 
results of the power gain and efficiency at 836.5 MHz with a power supply of 3.6 V. The maximum 
power-added efficiency (PAE) achieved at 27-dBm output power is over 70%. To integrate the RF parts 
of the PMPT into one PCB, a pair of commercially available single-pole single-throw (SPST) RF 
switches was used for pulse modulation on the modulated constant-envelope signal, as shown in Fig. 21. 
    15 
A detailed schematic of the RF PA, the dc–dc converter, and the RF switch is shown in Fig. 22. The 
input RF phase signal is first split by a power splitter before entering a pair of RF switches. The pair of 
commercially available switches [17] is internally matched to 50 Ω, is connected to the input of a pair of 
two-stage PAs, and is used to modulate the constant envelope RF input signal. The pair of two-stage PAs 
uses commercially available cascaded enhancement-mode pseudomorphic high electron mobility 
transistors (pHEMTs) [18] biased slightly above the threshold voltage to operate under class-AB. The 
output power of the pair of two-stage PAs was then combined using a power combiner. When close to the 
peak power level, the RF PAs are highly overdriven such that the PAs are switching to increase efficiency. 
Using a single-tone signal at 836.5 MHz, the two-stage PA delivered over 29 dBm of output power with 
over 20 dB of gain and 74% PAE. The dc–dc converter is constructed using a commercially available 
high-efficiency synchronous Buck converter operating with a 1-MHz switching frequency [19]. The 
output voltage of the dc–dc converter was set by a digitally programmable resistor controlled through a 
field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip to form a digitally programmable power supply. 
 
 
Fig. 22. Detailed schematic of the two-stage RF PAs, dc-dc converter, and RF switches. 
 
The average input power levels, Pin,avg, and power supply voltages for controlling the average output 
power levels, Pout,avg, are shown in Fig. 23. It is found that at a PA supply voltage of 1.0 V, Pout,avg 
decreases monotonically with decreased Pin,avg. Therefore, the power control for this region can be 
achieved using a conventional automatic gain control (AGC) loop. 
The probability density functions (pdfs) of the PA output power levels for IS-95 CDMA and 
W-CDMA standards have been reported in [20]–[22]. Depending on the communication standard, the 
output power changes each burst, slot, or frame. The average efficiency can be derived as 
      (12)

Implementation of Miniaturized 3-dB Branch-Line Hybrid Coupler With Harmonics Suppression 
For verification, a prototype 3-dB branch-line hybrid coupler was designed at a center frequency of 
836.5 MHz by using ADS Momentum. The layout of the proposed structure for implementing the hybrid 
is shown in Fig. 24. The implementation consists of four leaf-vein structures placed inside the free area of 
the hybrid. Those four leaf-vein structures provide the shunt-to-ground capacitance by themselves and the 
parallel capacitance shunt with the transmission lines by interdigitated coupling. 
Fig. 9 shows that the larger the values of CP and Ch are, the shorter the transmission line is. However, 
the values of Ch and CP are restricted by available physical area of the hybrid coupler and feasible 
characteristic impedance of the transmission line. In this work, the values of Ch and CP are 1.8 pF and 2.1 
pF, respectively. The characteristic impedances of the transmission lines of the hybrid are 45 Ω and 60 Ω. 
The design was implemented with the two-layer FR-4 PCB of which the relative permittivity (εr) and 
thickness are 4.22 and 40 mils, respectively. 
Using the designed parameters, the branch-line hybrid was fabricated. Fig. 25 shows the photograph 
of the miniaturized 3-dB branch-line hybrid coupler. An implementation of the conventional quarter- 
wavelength transmission line hybrid is also shown in Fig. 25 for comparison. The proposed 
miniaturization technique achieves 73.2% of size reduction compared to the conventional structure.

Implementation of 3-dB Lumped-elements Wilkinson Combiner/Splitter 
Also for verification, a prototype 3-dB lumped-elements Wilkinson combiner/splitter was designed 
at a center frequency of 836.5 MHz by using the Murata SMD components. The detail schematic with 
values and the PCB photo of this low-pass structure for implementing the lumped-elements Wilkinson is 
shown in Fig. 28. The implementation consists of a 0402 SMD 100 Ω resistor, four 0402 SMD 
multi-layer capacitors and two 0402 SMD coiled inductors. The two-way lumped-elements Wilkinson 
3-dB power splitter and combiner are used to split and combine the RF signals, and their measured 
insertion loss is around 0.3 dB. The measured return loss and isolation are better than 20 dB at the desired 
transmit band of 824–849 MHz shown in Fig. 29.

會議的議程內容著重在微波技術的應用。由於亞洲在微波方面的研究越來越活躍，
尤其是日本，因此參加會議的人士也是來自世界各地，並不侷限在亞洲。 
今年的會議是在日本距離橫濱市不遠的 Kanagawa 舉辦，會議場地 Pacifico 
Yokohama 會議中心相當適合舉辦大型辦國際會議，有地鐵可直達會場，交通非
常方便。會場分成兩部分，一半可用於發表會議論文，另一半則可當作展覽場
所，而會場又與大型購物中心相連，因此用餐購物都相當方便。由於會場周遭
的旅館都相當昂貴（以台灣的標準），雖然將旅館訂在離會場較遠的橫濱市地區，
但搭地鐵赴會仍是十分方便。反觀國內並無真正適合舉辦大型國際會議的場所，
反映我國對許多基礎建設的願景規劃，比之真正的先進國家是相當落後的。

對服務應可借鏡日本的建置。 
此次參加 APMC 收穫頗多，豐富的資料在回國後還要一段時間才能消化所
有重要的技術新知，同時也開拓了視野，並激發一些有趣的想法。而且日本的都
市軟硬體建設與規劃，也讓我留下深刻的印象。
