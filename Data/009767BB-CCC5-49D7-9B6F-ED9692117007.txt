Hwang et al.: Simulation and Experiment of a Cogeneration System
The study of Minutillo [2] and Wang [3] proposed a cogen-
eration system equipped with two fuel cell stacks, a natural
gas steam reforming unit, a heat recovery unit, electrical
devices, such as batteries, DC/AC converters, and auxiliary
components, such as compressors and pumps. To evaluate
the electrical and thermal energy production and to estimate
the system efficiency, energy analysis was conducted using a
numerical model. The results showed that the cogeneration
system can provide 2.5 kW with an electrical efficiency of
40% and a combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency of
88%. Yu et al. [4] studied the control strategies of a PEMFC
system of a residential power generator (RPG). In their study,
a simulation model of the PEMFC system was created, com-
prising a turbo blower, a membrane humidifier, two cooling
circuits, and a PEMFC stack, then the dynamic response of in-
dividual components during dynamic operation was ob-
served. This RPG could provide electric power and hot water
simultaneously, resulting in high efficiency through heat
recovery. In the study by Paepe et al. [5], a CHP system was
presented to provide household heating through electrically
generated waste heat and was successfully used.
Software-based simulation models of fuel cell systems can
be found in numerous articles. Hawkes and Leach [6] used a
mathematical formulation to compare the energy efficiency of
three types of CHP systems: a fuel cell system, Stirling
engine, and internal combustion engine. They observed that
fuel cell system carried the lowest heat-to-power ratio, 1:1,
and achieved an efficiency of approximately 85% when a
heat-led control strategy was applied. Korsgaard et al. [7]
used Matlab to model and simulate the waste heat generated
by a high-temperature PEMFC system. The energy efficiency
of the system, integrating a steam reforming-based process-
ing unit, was measured as high as 90–100 (LHV%). Gigliucci
et al. [8] indicated that the design of a residential CHP fuel
cell system should be aimed at suitability to residential custo-
mers, connectivity to the internet, and standalone functional-
ities. König et al. [9] in their study, a mathematical model was
developed to predict system performances and operating pa-
rameters under off-design conditions with an improved sys-
tem efficiency of more than 10%. König et al. [9] believed that
the CHP fuel cell system provided a possible solution for high
fuel utilization efficiency by generating energy and heat
simultaneously. Min et al. [10] built a system model that
accounted for the fuel processing system, fuel cell coolant sys-
tem, air supplier, and humidifier/dehumidifier. The dynamic
response was characterized by a power current controller to
determine the fuel flow rate, which was computed and fed
back through fuel consumption, to maintain the system effi-
ciency. The system performance was enhanced by incorporat-
ing load, fuel flow, and control strategies. Shan and Choe [11]
proposed a PEMFC model to analyze the influence of startup
and end temperature distribution on fuel cell efficiency, as
well as the influence of temperature on the water content in
membranes of cells and cathode inlet relative humidity. The
dynamic load not only resulted in increased water content in
the membranes but also increased internal resistance in the
system. The increase in load also increased the heat stored in
the system and thus required a proper cooling strategy. Chu
and Hwang [12–14] studied the design of a small PEMFC
CHP cogeneration system. The properties of the key compo-
nents and the durability of the system were analyzed. They
concluded that a simplified design and reformer technique
were required, and that using bipolar plates could be vital to
the development and cost reduction of PEMFC technology.
2 Design of Fuel Cell-Based System
2.1 The Model of the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell
(PEMFC)
The current generation of fuel cells, which involves a ser-
ious of physical and chemical reactions, is a process contain-
ing resistances and obstacles. These resistances include (i) the
resistance of adsorption and dissociation regarding the oxy-
gen applied on the catalyst surface; (ii) the conduction resis-
tance between the proton and electrolyte; and (iii) the conduc-
tion resistance between the electron, the catalyst, and the
carrier. To overcome these resistances, the fuel cell must con-
sume energy to sustain the reaction on the electrodes. This
process results in a reversible potential shift in the electrode
potential, which is known as polarization. The electrochemi-
cal reactions within the PEMFC can be formulated as follows:
Anode side: H2 → 2H
  2e (1)
Cathode side: 2H  2e  1
2
O2 → H2O (2)
Overall reaction: H2  12O2 → H2OHeat (3)
2.2 Fuel Cell-Based Cogeneration System Modules
As shown in Figure 1, the fuel cell-based cogeneration sys-
tem consists of a fuel cell module (with heat recovery mod-
ule), hydrogen supply module, air supply module, coolant
supply module, load current control block, and real-time
monitor. These system modules are described in the follow-
ing sections.
2.3 Fuel Cell System Module
The adopted fuel cell system module is shown in Figure 2.
Fixed relation is used in the cell polarization performance
curve that is used to simulate the PEMFC. The coolant runs
through the PEMFC to transfer heat. The heat stored in the
cell stack depends on the size of the stack and can be deter-
mined through system module parameters.

3 System Simulation andAnalysis
3.1 Efficiency Analysis
The performance of a fuel cell is typically determined by
its efficiency. For a cogeneration fuel cell, three efficiencies
must be analyzed: thermal efficiency, electrical efficiency,
and total efficiency, which combines thermal and electrical
efficiency and is also called CHP efficiency or the cogenera-
tion efficiency. These efficiencies are defined as follows:
Thermal Efficiency =
thermal energy absorbed by the coolant
heat of the supplied hydrogen fuel
(4)
Electrical Efficiency  net output of electrical power
heat of the supplied hydrogen fuel
(5)
Combined Heat and Power Efficiency
 Thermal Efficiency + Electrical Efficiency (6)
3.1.1 Thermal Efficiency
Based on the thermal efficiency definition in Eq. (4), the
heat recovery energy is actually the power generated from
the heat, which is absorbed by the coolant (water) in the
cogeneration system, and can be mathematically formulated
as follows:
eT 
vH2O × qH2O ×CH2O ×DT
 
nH2 ×Dh
(7)
∇  r1∇electronic   0 (8)
vH2O is the water volume flow rate (m
3 s–1), qH2O the den-
sity of the coolant (water) (1,000 kg m–3), CH2O the specific
heat capacity of water (4.18 kJ kg–1 K–1), DT the temperature
difference before the coolant absorbed the energy and after
(K), nH2 the hydrogen molar flow rate (mol s
–1), and Dh is the
lower heating value of hydrogen (241.83 kJ mol–1).
Before analyzing the thermal efficiency, we must ensure
all the physical values in Eq. (7) can be measured. The water
volume flow rate and temperature difference in the numera-
tor is easy to measure. In our system, the water volume flow
rate is a value to be set and DT is the temperature difference
measured between the coolant inlet and outlet. Additionally,
the hydrogen molar flow rate can be set to the flow rate used
in the hydrogen supply system module. Thus, the thermal
efficiency can be rewritten as follows:
eT 
Pwater
PH2
 mH2O ×CH2O ×DT
05 × I ×C ×Dh ×N
(9)
mH2O  vH2O × qH2O is the mass flow rate of hot water gen-
erated in system cooling (kg s–1), I the current running
through the fuel cell stack (A), C the transfer coefficient,
0.6267 mgH2 A
–1 min–1, and the hydrogen consumption rate
per Am of the current, Dh the lower heating value of hydro-
gen (241.83 kJ mol–1), and N is the number of single cells in a
cell stack; there are 63.
In the simulation, the computation of thermal efficiency
adopts a real-time approach, meaning the transient flow of
hot water generation, and the real-time temperature differ-
ence at the coolant inlet and outlet are measured. Briefly, the
thermal efficiency based on a real-time approach is the heat
recovery power to the fuel (hydrogen) supply power ratio.
The real-time-based thermal efficiency can be computed
by Eq. (7). The thermal efficiency over time, or the average
thermal efficiency, can be computed by obtaining the integral
of every transient heat recovery under a time interval and
divided by the system operation time.
The electrochemistry reaction in the fuel cell transforms
the chemical energy, or the free energy difference (DG), into
electromotive force (DE).
DG  Dh TDs (10)
In a hydrogen fuel cell system, Dh = 241.83 kJ mol–1 and
Ds = 163 J mol–1 K–1. Under a temperature of 27 °C (300 K),
the energy loss, TDs, caused by entropy, Ds, is 48.9 kJ mol–1,
meaning approximately 80% of the heat is transformed into
electrical energy.
3.1.2 Electrical Efficiency
Based on the definition in Eq. (5), the electrical efficiency
can be rewritten as follows:
eE 
Pout
nH2 ×Dh
(11)
where Pout is the net output power, which is the power mea-
sured at the output of the fuel cell system module. The net

Hwang et al.: Simulation and Experiment of a Cogeneration System
4.2.3 Hydrogen Supply Molar Flow Rate
Equations (7) and (11) show that the molar flow rate in the
hydrogen supplies directly influences thermal and electrical
efficiency. If use of the fuel supply is minimal while provid-
ing maximum power, we can obtain better thermal and elec-
trical efficiency. By changing the current, load, and propor-
tion of the hydrogen inhale flow rate, we can calculate the
required minimum inhale flow rate under different loads.
Figure 9 shows the hydrogen flow rate under different
powers. The flow rate is set to the minimum rate measured
under the same load.
4.2.4 Humidification of the Air Supply System and PEM
Humidification
In a fuel cell system, the greater the current and power are
the better the thermal efficiency. However, electrical effi-
ciency slightly decreases when the load is increased. While
the system is operating, the air supply system also humidifies
gases. The proportion of gas humidification is as follows:
water vapor = 30%, nitrogen = 55.3%, oxygen = 14.7%, and
relative humidification = 30%.
In Figure 10, when the water content in the air humidifica-
tion is set to 30% under a load of 65 A (3 kW), maximum
power is measured at 3,024 W. In Figure 11, when the water
content in the air humidification is set to 29% under a load of
91 A (4 kW), maximum power is measured at 4,006 W. In
Figure 12, when the water content in the air humidification is
set to 28% under a load of 119 A (5 kW), maximum power is
measured at 5,021 W. In a fuel cell system, the higher the load
is, the faster the water generation rate. When the load is
increased, the humidification in the fuel supply system
should be reduced to maintain a lower PEM relative humidi-
fication and preserve cell efficiency.

Hwang et al.: Simulation and Experiment of a Cogeneration System
office load for 11 h. In the experiment, the load power in the
fuel cell system after operating for 11 h is approximately 830–
2,100 W, which does not match the power of 2,116–5,359 W
(in Figures 4–9) measured from the dynamic simulation of
the fuel cell system. This mismatch may be attributed to the
maximum output power of the fuel cell used in the experi-
ment being only 3 kW. Nevertheless, the temperature at the
coolant outlet and accumulated water volume can be used as
a reference. In the references, a temperature of 330 K and
205 L of hot water were reported as the experimental data.
With our simulation, the results show an average tempera-
ture of 332.7 K and 421.8 L of hot water.
5 Conclusion
This study presents a complete fuel cell-based cogenera-
tion system, comprising a fuel cell subsystem, a fuel supply
subsystem, a coolant flow rate control subsystem, and all
other subsystems. We examined the influences on the sys-
tem’s efficiencies, including thermal efficiency, electrical effi-
ciency, and CHP efficiency.
The simulation results of system efficiencies regarding dif-
ferent load powers are shown in Figure 6. For example, under
a power of 5 kW, the thermal efficiency is measured as 36.9%,
and the CHP efficiency is 82.9%. The results in Figure 6 show
that both the thermal and CHP efficiencies increase when the
load is increased. Under a load of 2.5–5 kW, the simulation
result of the CHP efficiency ranges from 56.4 to 82.9%, which
approaches the efficiency of 60–80%, if directly calculated
from the equation.
The influences on thermal efficiency are summarized as
follows:
(i) Figure 6 indicates that the power load has a direct influ-
ence on thermal efficiency. When the load increases from
2.5 to 5 kW, the thermal efficiency increases from 4.9 to
36.9%. When the load increases, the rate of the fuel con-
sumption in the system, as well as the generation of elec-
tricity, water, and heat, also increase. Therefore, thermal
efficiency increases when the load increases.
(ii) The coolant flow rate influences thermal efficiency. In
Figure 7, under a load of 91 A (4 kW), when the coolant
flow rate changes from 1 to 1.4 L min–1, the thermal effi-
ciency gradually increases from 28.1 to 34.4%. In Fig-
ure 8, under a load of 119 A (5 kW), when the coolant
flow rate changes from 1.7 to 2.1 L min–1, the thermal
efficiency increases from 36.9 to 41%. Therefore, thermal
efficiency increases when the coolant flow rate increases.
When establishing the coolant flow rate under different
loads a range of operating temperatures under which the
fuel cell system maintains a stable operating temperature
and generates stable power should be considered.
The influences on electrical efficiency are summarized as
follows:
The humidification of the air supply system influences
electrical efficiency. The results in Figure 6 show that the elec-
trical efficiency slightly decreases when the power load is
increased. While changing the inhale humidity in the air sup-
ply system, the following results are observed: under a cur-
rent load of 65 A and humidification of 30%, maximum
power is measured at 3,024 W. Under a current load of 91 A
and humidification of 29%, the power measures up to
4,006 W. Under a current load of 119 A and humidification of
28%, maximum power is measured at 5,021 W. Therefore,
when the load is increased, the required humidification in the
air supply system is slightly decreased to adjust the water
content in the internal PEM and the airway, thus maintaining
a stable power output.

ABSTRACT 
This research is mainly processing on a fixed proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system, applying the simulate software, 
Matlab/ Simulink to analyzing and deriving reasonable methods of design, analysis, and numerical analysis to discuss the efficiency of a 
proton exchange membrane fuel cell. However, the input of the polarization loss on PEM fuel cell will lead to an unsteady DC voltage. 
Therefore, our research will apply DC converter to get a stable output voltage, and then combine with a super capacitors and second batteries 
as a fuel cell generated system, which supplies energy management and loading distribution. Moreover, change the parameters and process 
the simulation of numerical models by using Matlab/Simulink to build models. Finally, analyze the result from static conditions to acquire 
the best parameters and operating conditions in order to enhance the efficiency of the PEM fuel cell.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Known for its lack of emissions and its high energy intensity, 
hydrogen as an energy carrier can play an important role for energy 
conversion in the future. Hydrogen fuel can be obtained from many 
sources. Hydrogen can be produced through water electrolysis and 
kept in storage for use. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell 
(PEMFC) is a room-temperature fuel cell, and is the most versatile 
among all types of fuel cells. In addition to the low pollution and 
high efficiency of typical fuel cells, the PEMFC has the following 
characteristics: 
1.The PEMFC is a low-temperature operated battery and starts up 
quickly. 
 
2.The electrolyte of the PEMFC is polymer, which is superior to 
liquid electrolyte, which has the problems of erosion and overflow. 
 
3.The PEMFC can be used in many applications, including large-
scale power plants, distributed power systems, stationary generators, 
and portable power system. Additionally, the PEMFC is the only 
fuel cell which has been applied in vehicles. 
4.The PEMFC can be used in hybrid thermal/electric systems to 
generate electricity in addition to heat, thus greatly improving 
efficiency. 
This study develops a mathematical model of the PEMFC, and 
combines the simulation results on the optimal design with the 
experimental results to achieve better efficiency of the fuel cell. 
Correa et al. [1] represented the PEMFC as an electrochemical 
model, from which they obtained the polarization curve; a plot 
showing the relationship between voltage, current, and the power 
output; and the simulation of the dynamic response. The simulation 
results based on the model closely correspond to the real output 
measured in a PEMFC. Yerramalla and Kuo [2, 3] modeled the 
PEMFC using Matlab/Simulink packaged software. In their study, 
linear and nonlinear numerical analysis of the model was used to 
achieve optimal performance of the PEMFC, while reducing the 
time required for simulation. Iqbal [4] presented a model for a 
hybrid wind/fuel cell power generation system. To explore the 
feasibility of the hybrid generation system, transient responses due 
to changes in the load current were analysed [5] developed control 
strategies to evaluate performance of a hybrid fuel cell/battery 
power system. When tested under various load output powers, the 
proposed control strategies were shown to increase the power of the 
fuel cell and achieve better fuel cell stack efficiency. 
 
2. System Components 
The electrochemical reactions within the PEMFC can be 
formulated as follows: 
Anode side: −+ +→ e2H2H2                                                      (1) 
Cathode side: OHO
2
1e2H2 22 →++ −+                                        (2) 
Overall  reaction: HeatOHO
2
1H 222 +→+                              (3) 
In practice, the ideal reversible electromotive force of the 
PEMFC is reduced by various potential losses within the cell.  
Accordingly, in developing the PEMFC model, the terminal voltage 
(
fcV ) of the fuel cell is formulated as follows: 
conohmactofc VVVVV −−−=                                        (4) 
where oV is the open circuit voltage, actV is the activation loss, ohmV is 
the ohmic loss and conV is the concentration loss. 
 
2.1 Secondary Battery 
 
When the power in a secondary battery (rechargeable battery) 
is used up, the battery can be charged by another DC power source, 
which results in the renewed reaction of the active substances in the 
battery. The number of times that a secondary battery can be 
charged and discharged is primarily determined by the electrode 
reversibility and the stability of the membrane and structural 
material in the repetitive charge/discharge process. In the present

3.2.4 Concentration Overpotential (
c o nV ) 
 
If the load requires a large current, and the fuel gas and the 
oxidant are not provided to the PEMFC for reaction quickly enough, 
then it is possible that the electrode surface cannot maintain an 
appropriate reactant concentration, which causes concentration 
overpotential [8]. The concentration overpotential is defined in 
Equation (16).

4. Methods 
 
In this study, Matlab/Simulink was used to compute the equations 
of the PEMFC and other subsystems, and to create and verify the 
accuracy of the models. The PEMFC system was modeled in a 
steady state to achieve optimal system integration, and the system 
parameters were defined as dependent on the dynamic response and 
transient response, regarding changes in load. 
To fully evaluate the effect of each component on the PEMFC 
system, the system components were modeled as subsystems based 
on equations, as shown from figures 4-1. Each subsystem was 
simulated and numerically analyzed on various parameters.

5.Component Simulation 
 
Based on the cell output parameters listed in Table 5-1, the 
PEMFC system was simulated with the resistive load supplied by 
the fuel cell module. Figure 5-1 shows the output performance curve 
of the PEMFC [9]. The performance curve indicated that 20 to 42 V 
is the superior operating range for voltage, and the power can reach 
2 kW under the best overall output efficiency.  
The discharge performance of the Li-ion and the supercapacitor, 
through simulation with given parameters, are shown in figures 5-2 
and 5-3, respectively. The discharge performance curves were 
obtained by simulation with different current values under a given 
power capacity. 
 
5.1. System Simulation 
 
Based on the values listed in Table 5-2, PEMFC systems under 
various load configurations were simulated, and their output 
performance curves were evaluated. To determine system 
performance, multiple configurations of loads were analyzed. The 
analysis began with the configuration of the resistive load supplied 
directly by the fuel cell. The output voltage of this configuration is 
shown in Fig. 5-4 without any other measurement device. In this 
configuration, the fuel cell supplies the power to the load as soon as 
it starts up. The results indicate that the output voltage on the load 
varies between 0 V and 42 V at the moment of fuel cell startup; 
which suggests that at fuel cell startup, the fuel is insufficient for the 
voltage output required.  
After 0.03 ms, the output voltage varies between 25 V and 42 
V. The fuel cell cannot provide stable voltage at the load terminals; 
therefore, the configuration of using fuel cell as the only power 
source is not suggested in this system. The DC-DC converter was 
connected to the fuel cell to regulate the DC voltage at the load. 
After startup, the fuel cell supplied the load and the output of the 
DC-DC converter, which results in a fuel cell that operates at a high 
current and a low voltage. The voltage of the buck converter 
changes with the transient response in the fuel cell output.  
When the fuel cell maintained output and reached steady-state 
performance, the fuel cell continued to supply the load and sustained

6. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, performances based on the output voltages 
measured in PEMFC systems under different operating conditions 
were analyzed and compared. The use of a DC-DC converter can 
provide stable output voltage; however, the output voltage may 
change due to the transient response of the fuel cell. Therefore, the 
battery and the supercapacitor were integrated as an auxiliary power 
source. Under the test of a stable load, the auxiliary power source 
effectively reduces the potential of insufficient voltage at the load 
terminals, which causes the system to shut down operations. Once 
the PEMFC system is stable, the inverter can be incorporated to 
convert the DC voltage to AC voltage, thus extending the scope of 
application.

Combined with Eq. (2.2), the reversible potential can be

computed from the partial pressure and the reversible potential, as 
shown in Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6).

where ηnom is the fixed efficiency of lower heating value in the cell 
stack, Δh0(H2O(gas)) is the H2O enthalpy, Vnom is the fixed voltage, 
Inom is the fixed current, Vlpm(air)nom is the fixed air flow rate, Pairnom is 
the fixed absolute pressure of air, and Tnom is the fixed operating 
temperature. 
Based on the conversion rate, the fixed partial pressure and the 
reversible potential of the gas can be derived. With the known 
values of Eoc, i0, and b, assuming that the cell stack is working under 
standard conditions, which means a constant conversion rate, then 
the values of α, GΔ , and Kc can be determined. 
If there is no input such as fuel or air, then we can assume that 
the cell stack is working at a constant gas conversion rate (the fixed 
conversion rate); meaning that the gas supply is adjusted based on 
the present current. Under any load, only a little more gas than that 
required by the load is supplied. The maximum conductive current 
in the cell stack is limited to the maximum flow rates of the fuel and 
the air. Except for the maximum current, the voltage output in the 
cell stack decreases as the current increases. The peak utilization 
( )peak(O 2UF ) and its corresponding voltage drop (Vu) are used to 
model the oxygen consumption regarding the fuel cell output 
voltage. The reversible potential is modified as follows:

We assume that the PEMFC is working under standard 
conditions, which– include a constant operating temperature, 
sufficient supply of fuel at all times, and a supply of ideal gas. The 
following conditions are not considered: (1) The by-product 
generated from the chemical reactive power caused by local 
pressure in the fuel cell; (2) the temperature and humidity of the 
PEM; and (3) gas or water leakage in the membrane.

4.Results and Discussion 
 
4.1 System Validation 
 
The dynamic simulation of the fuel cell HEV was evaluated by 
giving positive and negative acceleration commands to test the 
loading. The results are shown in figures 4.1 to 4.6.  
Figures 4.1 to 4.3 show the positive loading when the 
accelerator gave the commands for 20 %, 40 %, and 60 % at 5 s 
after starting. At 20 % acceleration, the power was provided 
primarily by the fuel cell, and the Li-ion battery was used as an 
auxiliary power source. At 40 % acceleration, the auxiliary power 
provided by the Li-ion battery is increasing because of the increased 
load. At 60 % acceleration, the power provided by the Li-ion battery 
is significantly more than the power provided at 20 % and 40 % 
acceleration. The results indicated that at 60 % acceleration, the Li-
ion battery overpowered the fuel cell after 5 to 6 s. 
Conversely, figures 4.4 to 4.6 show the results with a negative load. 
A command of 50 % positive accelerating was given initially. 
Starting at 5 seconds, commands were given for negative 
acceleration of -10 %, -30 %, and -50 %. The results indicate that 
when the negative acceleration increases, the power absorbed by the 
Li-ion battery increases, and the time to absorb the power is also 
sustained for a longer time, as shown in Fig. 4.6.
