1. Introduction 
Atmospheric pressure (AP) plasmas have attracted considerable attention in the past decades due to the fact 
that no vacuum system is needed, which leads to system mobility and flexibility1. Numerous applications, 
such as surface modification, thin film deposition, and nanoparticle fabrication2-4, using AP plasmas are 
reported. Among these applications, using AP plasmas to fabricate nano-structured materials has been 
promising due to the fact that high reactivity can be obtained under relatively low temperature and the 
possibility of scale up, as opposed to other processes such as solution-based techniques5-6, spray pyrolysis7, 
and laser ablation8.   
Among the large number of nano-structured materials, ZnO is a technologically important material with 
various important applications such as biomedical applications9, UV shielding 10, biosensors11, sensor12. 
Among ZnO nanoparticles fabrication processes, spray pyrolysis is promising due to its low cost and its 
capability for continuous fabrication. The particle size obtained by this process, however, depends on mist 
generated and one has little control for it13. To obtain a better control in the particle size, Okuyama et. al14 
reported a novel route called salt-assisted spray pyrolysis (SASP). In this process, lithium or sodium salts are 
added and acts as a high temperature solvent. It is shown that the particle size and even its morphology can be 
well tailored through this route14-15. Due to the need of a reasonable reaction time, this process requires a 
reactor of length one meter or longer to obtained desired conversion. Under this circumstance, plasma assisted 
processes provide a route with high reactivity under moderate temperature.  
The kinetics and transport of the reactive species are among the most critical factors that dominate the 
plasma process.  The significant influence of ambient air to the APPJ has long been recognized16-20.  In 
particular, nitrogen plasmas are significantly affected by oxygen molecules.  Metastable nitrogen molecules 
are produced primarily by electron-impact excitation.  Without the “impurities” such as oxygen molecules, 
the major loss pathway of nitrogen molecules are N2(B3Πg) → N2(A3Σ+u) + hν (radiation) and N2(B3Πg) +N2 
→ N2(A3Σ+u) + N2 (energy transference).  Such an approach retains the flexibility and the mobility of the 
APPJ, as opposed to the case operating the APPJ in a closed chamber with a controlled atmosphere.  A large 
number of numerical simulation work focuses on the study of AP plasmas as well as the influence of the trace 
gas to the plasma behavior.  Choi et al. 17 showed that a small amount of oxygen addition results in a 
significantly decrease in excited nitrogen molecule densities in a dielectric barrier discharge.  The neutral gas 
flow was not considered in this work.  Bauchire et al. 21 showed that the temperature and velocity spatial 
profiles can be very different as the flow rate changes.  Shamsi et al. 22 studied the heat transfer mechanism 
of a high power plasma jet.  Chau et al. 23 simulated an argon DC plasma torch and found the model captures 
the major characteristics of the torch.  Despite of the large number of literatures in modeling plasma jet of 
various types as well as in studying the influence of the ambient air to the plasma behavior, the work focuses 
on the significantly different behavior of the jet, namely the spatial profile of excited state species densities, 
with and without the contact with the ambient air remains rare. 
In the first part of this project, we report the fabrication of ZnO nanoparticles using a nitrogen AP plasma 
jet with the goal of seeking for a high rate process that fabricates nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. 
The plasma is sustained by a repetitive pulsed DC power source. The mixtures of zinc salt and sodium or 
 3
well as mass conservation equations for each individual neutral species.  Neutral molecules and atoms are 
treated as separated species that are described by their own conservation equation and exchange mass through 
collisions.  The model geometry and the equation system are setup and solved iteratively with COMSOL 
MultiphysicsTM.  The over all mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations are first solved.  The 
conservation equations for nitrogen molecules and radicals are then solved.  Finally, oxygen-containing 
species are solved.  This iteration process is repeated until the model converges.   
 Species considered in the model include ground state nitrogen (N2), nitrogen radical (N), excited state 
nitrogen molecules N2 A3Σu (N2(A)), N2 B3Πg (N2(B)), N2 C3Πu (N2(C)), and N2 a’Σu- ((N2(a)), oxygen (O2), 
oxygen radical (O), ozone (O3), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O).  
The electron density and temperature are set as pre-defined constants in the plasma zone (region CDFE shown 
in Figure 1) and are 1018 m-3 and 1.3 eV, respectively.  These numbers are chosen based on those reported in 
the literature 24.  The intention is to use averaged numbers to represent the temporal- and spatial-varied 
natures of the discharge.  Ionic species are not considered.  The electron-impact reactions are not 
considered in the downstream region due to the fact that the electrons lose energy readily upon leaving the 
plasma zone and are not kinetically important in the downstream region.  The reaction set contains major 
electron-impact and heavy particle reactions in the mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen.  
 
4. Results and Discussions 
A. ZnO Nanoparticle Fabrication 
The diagnostic works of this AP plasma jet reported previously showed that this plasma jet undergoes a 
glow-to-arc mode transition within each power cycle 25-27. The gas temperature is several hundreds of K at the 
jet exit and decreases rapidly as the distance increases. Given this temperature, the rapid reaction rate of the 
precursor is most likely a result of the reactivity of the plasma.  
ZnO particles synthesis using an AP nitrogen plasma jet with Zn(NO3)2, ZnCl2, and Zn(CH3COO)2 as the 
precursor is performed.  Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of the fabricated particles. We first note that major 
peaks of the hexagonal wurtzite structure ZnO are clearly seen. In addition, no detectable impurity is seen 
here, suggesting that the major crystalline phase is ZnO. The spectra show an (101) preferred orientation in all 
cases. The lattice constants can be determined using the peak locations and are calculated by the following 
equation 28,

where d(hkl) is d-spacing, h, k, and l are miller indices, and a and c are lattice constants. Based on XRD peak 
shown in Figure 2, the lattice constants a and c are calculated using (1 0 1) and (1 0 0) peaks and are 3.27 and 
5.20 Å, respectively. This is in good agreement with those reported in the literature (JCPDS No. 36-1451, a = 
3.24982 Å and c = 5.20661 Å)29. The XRD pattern shown in Figure 2 confirms that this AP plasma jet has the 
capability to convert zinc source solution to ZnO particles in a short period of time. The resident time of the 
 5
molecules in the case the jet is readily in contact with the ambient air.  With the existence of ambient air, 
N2(B) is quenched directly by oxygen molecules and indirectly by nitrogen monoxide.  These quenching 
reaction leads to a much rapid decay of the N2(B) density and therefore a much shorter jet length.  We note 
that in addition to quenching of N2(B), the existence of O2 also facilitates the loss of other active 
nitrogen-containing active species such as N2(A) molecules and N radicals through reactions.  N and N2(A) 
densities as a function of the z position located downstream of the jet exit for the cases with and without the 
presence of the glass tube are shown in Figure 5.   We first note that the significantly higher N radical 
density than that of N2(A) and N2(B) is consistent with that reported in the literature 36.  It is shown clearly 
that with the presence of the glass tube (without the ambient air), the densities of these reactive species extend 
more than 10 cm away from the jet exit.  Without the presence of the glass tube, however, the N radical and 
N2(A) densities decay much more readily due to the contact between the jet and the ambient air .    
Figure 6 shows the NO and NO2 densities as a function of the z position located downstream of the jet 
exit for the case without the presence of the glass tube.  It shows a higher NO density than that of NO2.  The 
initial rise of the NO density is a result of the reaction between oxygen and N atom.  The NO2 formation is 
through the reactions with NO.  Here we note that the model qualitatively captures the change of the visible 
length with the influence of the ambient air.  To more precisely capture the jet behavior, namely the down 
stream kinetics, implementation of the turbulence flow model is required and is currently underway. 
 
5. Concluding Remarks 
The ZnO particles synthesized in the AP plasma jet using different precursors have been performed.  It 
shows that with the addition of the sodium or lithium salts in the precursor solution, the particle size decreases 
significantly and more uniformly size-distributed particles are obtained.  This work shows that APPJ is a 
capable tool in the fabrication of metal oxide nanoparticles with a high rate. 
The effect of oxygen in the ambient air on the AP nitrogen plasma jet is studied using numerical 
simulation.  The model solves for steady-state equations of overall mass, momentum, and energy 
conservation, as well as mass conservation equations for each individual neutral species.  The change of the 
diffusivity as a result of the high flow rate is considered.  Experimentally, when the jet is operated with the 
shielding of a glass tube to minimize the effect of the ambient air, a much wider and longer visible jet is seen, 
as opposed to the case without the presence of the glass tube.  Simulation results qualitatively reproduce the 
experimental observations.  It shows that the quenching of the excited state nitrogen molecules by oxygen 
molecules is responsible to the change of the jet appearance.  Further, it shows that the entrainment of 
oxygen into the jet is unavoidable when the jet is in contact with the air.
