在汽車的應用上，焊接是一種常見的物件接連方式。焊接點的間距、形式影響車子的結構
性能。焊接點的多寡影響原料成本、整個車子製造週期的長短以及焊接機器手臂的個數和
設置須求。因此，發展方法和步驟設計焊接點間距和形式以便以較有效的方式應用焊接技
術是相當必要的。此計劃將研究如何模擬汽車結構焊接點性能。並將研究、發展焊接點間
距的優化，以便使用較少的焊接點而仍然可滿足車體結構噪音、振動、耐久性及安全性能
要求。計劃中將分析(CAE)與實物測試結果做比較，以了解分析(CAE)與實物測試的差異。
若是必要可做適度修正以使分析模型的性能預測更為正確，便於做為日後的設計之用。
對不同的性能分析，將使用不同方式模擬焊接點。本計劃將針對噪音、振動及安全性
來研究發展焊接點的模擬方式。再依照模擬方式做其性能分析，然後再研發焊接點間距的
優化。本計劃目標是發展焊接點間距優化，並希望將此方法發展應用到不同的製造接連方
式。
本計劃使用PATRAN來處理主要的分析模型，並應用不同模型來模擬噪音、振動的焊接
點或模擬安全性的焊接。對於分析方面，使用NASTRAN 來執行噪音、振動的分析，使用Dytran
執行安全性能分析。計劃中計算出焊接點間距對性能的敏感性。然後再研發焊接點間距的
優化。優化的標的是要能夠使用較少的焊接點個數而仍能滿足性能的需求。
計劃中也將模擬分析結果與實物測試比較。測試的物件將選用直線型的骨架結構做

摘要
對車體結構設計而言，結構輕量化與降低生產成本是目前熱門研究方向，因此結合往
年累積的經驗，應用CAD(Computer Aide Design)與CAE(Computer Aide Engineering)是目前
較常使用的設計方式。隨著現今科技的進步，有越來越多的接合方法應用於車體結構上，
如電阻點焊、雷射點焊以及鉚釘等等。
本文是針對點焊做振動與碰撞模擬分析與優化，研究中以MSC/PATRAN為前後處理
器，MSC/NASTRAN為NVH之分析與優化求解器，進行點焊個數的最佳化分佈。在NVH之
優化方面，以一簡單直線型樑為範例，利用六種建模法來模擬點焊的連結強度，分別為共
點建模法、CELAS建模法、CBAR建模法、Rigid Element 建模法、CWELD建模法以及Area
Contact建模法，比較參考文獻之實驗結果，在NVH方面以CELAS建模法為最接近實驗值，
將直線型梁點焊對NVH最佳化後可以順利減少20%的點焊數目。

1. 前言與研究目的
隨著現今科技的進步，有越來越多的接合方法應用於車體結構上，常用的接合方法諸
如電阻點焊(Resistance Spot Weld，簡稱RSW)、鐳射焊接(Laser Weld)、黏結(Adhesive
Bonding)、鉚釘(Rivet)、螺栓(Screw Bolt)、以及螺帽(Nut)等等，通常一輛汽車的車體上
大約有3500到4500個點焊。
傳統上來講，接合點的方式、配置、位置、個數、間距等，多半依從業人員過去的工
作經驗加以考慮機械製造、組裝限制條件等加以綜合設計，設計中並加入一些安全因素
(Safety Factor)，以確保製造誤差範圍內的物件可以滿足性能要求。但多數設計中並未考
慮接合點的數目與間距，藉由最佳化設計方法來改善點焊數目與間距，將可節省設計製造
過程中所耗費的時間、材料與人力成本，使整體設計與製造過程更為迅速與完善。在車體
結構中使用最多的連結方式就是點焊，因此本研究中將使用點焊來做點焊間距與點焊數目
的最佳化。
目前有多種點焊的CAE分析模型，在工業的製造過程中Strikunwong[1]，利用一個包含
電熱耦合(Electrical-Thermal Coupling)及熱機耦合(Thermal- Mechanical Coupling)的有限元
素模型(Finite Element Method，簡稱FEM)，模擬電阻點焊的生成過程。在加上Gohial[2]
以有限元素模型模擬電阻點焊，預估物件點焊區受熱影響的情況，評估焊核(Weld Nugget)
大小、點焊穿透的深度(Penetration depth)以及焊槍電擊尖端的使用壽命(Electrode Tip
6圖四 剛性蜘蛛模型等角視圖[7]
圖五 S型樑示意圖[8]
點焊是車輛結構較常用到之連接方式，減少點焊的個數就可減少汽車生產之材料、設
備與時間成本。因此本研究將建立六種點焊FEM模型，比較現有參考文獻之實驗數據，以找
出較合適模擬點焊的FEM模型，並最少化點焊個數。
一般NVH和碰撞安全是汽車品質好壞主觀評價的指標，本文針對此兩種性能作模擬分
析。為了建立更能準確模擬點焊行為，本文由參考文獻而衍生自建的點焊模型，並與文獻
中之實驗數據比較，探討各種分析結果與實驗值的差異性。
2. 電腦輔助模擬建模
為了找出最佳化的點焊數目與點焊間距，首先建立六種點焊的 CAE 模型，本文將以
MSC/PATRAN 來建構有限元素分析模型，以 MSC/NASTRAN 為點焊對於 NVH 之分析與優
化的求解器(Solver)，以 MSC/DYTRAN 為點焊對於碰撞安全之分析與模擬。論文中分別
以 MSC/PATRAN 建構共點、CELAS、CBAR、Rigid Element、CWELD 以及面積接觸法等
六種型式點焊的模型。
2.1 共點建模法
在共點建模法中，是藉由連接共同元素的方式使結合的面積近似實際點焊結合的面
積。在本研究中所使用的共點建模法，是連接四個四方形元素(Quad Element)，使每一個
點焊面皆為直徑5mm的正八邊形，如圖六所示。
圖六 共點模擬點焊的建模方式
8圖十 CWELD建模法模擬點焊之等角視圖
2.6 Area Contact建模法
在Area Contact建模法當中，以一組RBE3描述點焊。首先在欲建立點焊元素的上下兩
節點間先增加一個節點，此節點為RBE3元素的相依點(Dependent Point)，再以RBE3元素連
結點焊所涵蓋的面積中所有節點。RBE3元素會依據獨立點(Independent Point)的位移來決
定相依點的位移量。本文所使用的網格與模型如圖十一所示。
圖十一 Area Contact建模法模擬點焊之等角視圖
3. 點焊對於NVH之分析與優化
汽車行進中，常有外來的振動或噪音源。若車體與外來的振動頻率相同時，會產生
共振(Resonance)的現象，因此在結構設計的過程中必須避開共振產生。
本章節將引用車輛結構最常用的樑為例，分析其自然振動頻率，再以拓璞優化的方
式，針對物件振動的問題來做優化設計。
3.1 點焊對於NVH之分析
本章將引用第二章所建立的六種點焊模型做分析，再與參考文獻中的實驗值做比
較。 1999年Zhang與Röder[10]以實驗對四種點焊接合件做自然振動頻率測試。本文取其
中單點焊接和三點焊接件的實驗與分析模擬值作比較。如圖十二與圖十三所示。
在此點焊分析模型使用鋼材，其楊氏係數(Young’s Modulus) E為205 GPa，波森比
(Poisson’s Ratio) ν為0.3，材料密度(Material Density) ρ為7650 kg/m3，點焊面積直徑d為
5mm。

由表中可得本文所使用的六種建模法與參考文獻之實驗值差異不大。在此選擇與實
驗值差異最小的CELAS建模法來模擬直線樑點焊的FEM模型。
3.2 點焊對於NVH之優化
點焊之最佳化設計可以應用在許多方面，在不減少點焊個數情形下，可改變點焊間
距使有效提升結構之剛性。或者在不降低結構剛性的情形下，最小化點焊的數目，使有
效地降低生產成本。本文將以拓墣優化的方式作點焊優化，再以優化結果針對不同的應
用提出設計建議。
使用密度逼近的概念來最佳化點焊的數目，此優化問題設訂，敘述於方程式(1)至(3)。
目標函數(Objective Function)
Minimize n
jdC  (1)
限制條件(Constraint Equations)：
Subject to PP  ， 1, 2,...,p m (2)
0 1jC ， 1, 2,...,j nod (3)
其中，Cj為拓樸設計變數，n為收斂指數， P 為限制函數(Constraint Function)， P 為
限制函數上限，m為限制條件數目，nod為設計變數的數目。CELAS建模法所使用的彈簧
常數Kj即可表示成
0
n
j jK K C (4)
其中，
jK 為容許的彈簧常數， 0K = 44000，為初始彈簧常數。
12
兩個點焊彈簧常數值漸趨於10%，而點焊位置1、5、6及10的彈簧常數漸趨於80%，點焊
位置2、4、7及9則漸趨於95%。
圖十七顯示樑中各個點焊的需求性，因為第一彎曲模態對稱中間點的特性，上下薄
板於整個振動過程都是緊靠一起的，故對於彎曲振動模式其所需的連結強度就不如其他
位置所需的強，故位置8、3是較不重要的點焊位置。位置2、4、7及9的點焊是連接結構
最重要的四點，位置1、5、6及10的點焊是連接結構次級重要的位置。
圖十七 點焊位置趨勢分佈圖
最佳化後的結果，可依實際需求、製造、生產限制條件、物件幾何形狀、點焊位置
等等，再做最後不同的應用與設計。本文依最佳化的結果，例舉兩種較常見的設計概念，
(1)減少點焊個數與(2)改善結構強度或性能，分析如下。
(1) 減少點焊個數：因為優化後中間兩點的彈簧常數趨近於0，表示中間兩點焊較不重
要，故可以考慮移除中間兩點，如圖十八所示
圖十八 減少點焊個數
(2) 改善結構強度或性能：在此考慮移調整點焊間距。因為中間兩點焊對彎曲振動模式
較不重要，因此增加中間點的點焊間距，移動點焊2、4、7及9往外5mm的距離，如
圖十九所示。

Noise Reduction of Electrically Powered Mass Rapid Train  
by Improving the Contact Conditions between the  
Rubbing Plates and the Friction Blocks

ABSTRACT 
A noticeable noise and vibration occurred when the 
Mass Rapid Train turned on a rail with a large turning 
angle.  A study was performed to investigate the source 
of the noise and vibration, to find the root causes, and to 
discuss the corrective actions to improve the issue. 
The investigation indicates the noise occurs between the 
slewing ring bearing and the friction sets.  The slewing 
ring bearing is located between the body and chassis 
systems.  It provides a relative rotation between the 
body and chassis.  The friction sets provide friction 
forces to prevent abrupt movements and to help to 
stabilize the relative motions between the body and 
chassis systems.  
The study shows under certain contact conditions 
unsmooth turning would occur and cause the noise and 
vibration.  A corrective action was suggested to improve 
the condition.   
INTRODUCTION 
The metro, shown in Figure 1, is one of the major 
transportation systems in the Taipei metropolitan area.  
The average daily volume is about 1.2 million people [1].  
It’s an electrically powered system.  There are 3 major 
routes and several short ones.     
 
 
Figure 1: Taipei Metro 
For the particular route in the study, the train is 
controlled by the central system with pre-set route, 
designed speed, accelerations, decelerations and stops.  
Around turns, the train automatically slows down, and 
reaccelerates after the turns.  The vibration and noise 
occurred during the turn and disappeared after the turn 
was completed.  
A study was conducted to identify the root causes.  The 
process started with recording the noise on the reported 
train, disassembling the systems, and inspecting the 
condition of each part.  A lab test to duplicate the 
reported problem observed on the train was established.  
A set of experiments were performed in the lab to 
identify the root causes.

INVESTIGATION PROCESS 
A microphone was used to investigate the source of the 
noise and vibration.  The reported train was monitored 
while it was still on the job.  The noise was recorded.  
When the train reached the terminal station, it was then 
pulled into the repair bay for investigation.  Both audible 
noise and tactile vibration were identified coming 
between the bearing system and the friction sets while 
the train was driven in a turn on the test track of the 
repair bay.  
The bearing system was disassembled from the train.  
During the disassembling, the torques of the fasteners, 
the cleanliness, thickness, deformation, wear, and the 
surface roughness of the rubbing plates and the friction 
blocks were inspected.  A noticeable uneven wear and 
deformation were found on the friction blocks.  Some 
residual particles were found between the rubbing plates 
and the friction blocks.   
 
Figure 8: Component Level Test 
A lab test was set-up to duplicate the noise and vibration 
condition that occurred on the train.  The lab test would 
allow to perform different experiments under a better 
controllable environment.  The set-up is shown in Figure 
8.  Based on the earlier investigation, it was identified 
that the noise and vibration came between the slewing 
ring bearing and friction sets.  Therefore the lab test was 
set to focus on the study between the bearing and 
friction sets.  The lab tests reduce the complexity of the 
vehicle-level tests, and shorten the time required for 
each set-up and changing over. 
ONE FACTOR AT A TIME TEST 
 
One-Factor-at-A-Time (OFAT) was used to identify the 
key factors.  The factors chosen for the experimental 
tests were based on the data recorded on the train, the 
measurements from the teardown parts, and the team 
brainstorm in considering the effects of the assembly 
sequence.

Through the OFAT screen process, it shows that the 
factors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 have main effects on the 
vibration/noise of the tested system.  The summary is 
listed in Table 1. 
 
Table 1: One Factor at a Time Test 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The factors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 have significant effects 
on duplicating the vibration and noise condition 
observed on the train.  They are discussed in the 
following. 
For factor 1, when the torque value is low, the contact 
force between the rubbing plate and the friction block 
becomes low.  When the contact force is low, the 
resistant force is low.  If the resistance force is low then 
the vibration and noise goes away.  However, without 
proper contact, there would be no sufficient force 
required to prevent abrupt relative motion between the 
body and chassis systems.  
The torque value of the screws is one of key controlled 
processes.  Therefore, the frequency of incorrect torque 
applied to the system is low.     
For factor 2, the sequence of tightening the screws 
affects the torque balance among the 4 screws.  The 
unbalance torque would cause uneven contact between 
the rubbing plates and friction blocks and lead the 
vibration and noise.  A 2-stage securing sequence was 
defined to follow.  In the first stage, secure the torque up 
to 85% value of the torque specification in the sequence 
shown in Figure 10.  And then torque all of screws to the 
targeted torque specification value in the same 
sequence.   
The sequence of securing the screws is one of key 
controlled processes.  The frequency of incorrect 
sequence used is low. 
For factor 3, the bolts are used to secure the friction 
block bases to the inner slewing ring.  This is done prior 
the friction plates secured by the screws, factor 1.  Due 
to the assembly sequence, factor 3 has little effect on 
duplicating the vibration and noise condition.   
For factor 4 and 7, the uneven distributed thicknesses of 
the friction blocks and rubbing plates cause uneven 
contact forces between the friction blocks and rubbing 
plates during turns.  The uneven contact condition 
becomes severer when the un-uniformity of thickness 
gets larger.  
The nominal thickness of the rubbing plates and fiction 
blocks is 8 mm.  The thickness should be no less than 6 
mm.  When the largest thickness difference among the 
three measured locations is bigger than 1 mm, the part 
should be replaced or processed.     
For factor 8, the warping/deformation of the rubbing 
plates affects the contact condition between the rubbing 
plates and friction blocks.  As the warpage of the plates

ABSTRACT 
A noticeable noise and vibration occurred when the 
Mass Rapid Train turned on a rail with a large turning 
angle.  A study was performed to investigate the source 
of the noise and vibration, to find the root causes, and to 
discuss the corrective actions to improve the issue. 
The investigation indicates the noise occurs between the 
slewing ring bearing and the friction sets.  The slewing 
ring bearing is located between the body and chassis 
systems.  It provides a relative rotation between the 
body and chassis.  The friction sets provide friction 
forces to prevent abrupt movements and to help to 
stabilize the relative motions between the body and 
chassis systems.  
The study shows under certain contact conditions 
unsmooth turning would occur and cause the noise and 
vibration.  A corrective action was suggested to improve 
the condition.   
INTRODUCTION 
The metro, shown in Figure 1, is one of the major 
transportation systems in the Taipei metropolitan area.  
The average daily volume is about 1.2 million people [1].  
It’s an electrically powered system.  There are 3 major 
routes and several short ones.     
 
 
Figure 1: Taipei Metro 
For the particular route in the study, the train is 
controlled by the central system with pre-set route, 
designed speed, accelerations, decelerations and stops.  
Around turns, the train automatically slows down, and 
reaccelerates after the turns.  The vibration and noise 
occurred during the turn and disappeared after the turn 
was completed.  
A study was conducted to identify the root causes.  The 
process started with recording the noise on the reported 
train, disassembling the systems, and inspecting the 
condition of each part.  A lab test to duplicate the 
reported problem observed on the train was established.  
A set of experiments were performed in the lab to 
identify the root causes.

INVESTIGATION PROCESS 
A microphone was used to investigate the source of the 
noise and vibration.  The reported train was monitored 
while it was still on the job.  The noise was recorded.  
When the train reached the terminal station, it was then 
pulled into the repair bay for investigation.  Both audible 
noise and tactile vibration were identified coming 
between the bearing system and the friction sets while 
the train was driven in a turn on the test track of the 
repair bay.  
The bearing system was disassembled from the train.  
During the disassembling, the torques of the fasteners, 
the cleanliness, thickness, deformation, wear, and the 
surface roughness of the rubbing plates and the friction 
blocks were inspected.  A noticeable uneven wear and 
deformation were found on the friction blocks.  Some 
residual particles were found between the rubbing plates 
and the friction blocks.   
 
Figure 8: Component Level Test 
A lab test was set-up to duplicate the noise and vibration 
condition that occurred on the train.  The lab test would 
allow to perform different experiments under a better 
controllable environment.  The set-up is shown in Figure 
8.  Based on the earlier investigation, it was identified 
that the noise and vibration came between the slewing 
ring bearing and friction sets.  Therefore the lab test was 
set to focus on the study between the bearing and 
friction sets.  The lab tests reduce the complexity of the 
vehicle-level tests, and shorten the time required for 
each set-up and changing over. 
ONE FACTOR AT A TIME TEST 
 
One-Factor-at-A-Time (OFAT) was used to identify the 
key factors.  The factors chosen for the experimental 
tests were based on the data recorded on the train, the 
measurements from the teardown parts, and the team 
brainstorm in considering the effects of the assembly 
sequence.

Through the OFAT screen process, it shows that the 
factors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 have main effects on the 
vibration/noise of the tested system.  The summary is 
listed in Table 1. 
 
Table 1: One Factor at a Time Test 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The factors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 have significant effects 
on duplicating the vibration and noise condition 
observed on the train.  They are discussed in the 
following. 
For factor 1, when the torque value is low, the contact 
force between the rubbing plate and the friction block 
becomes low.  When the contact force is low, the 
resistant force is low.  If the resistance force is low then 
the vibration and noise goes away.  However, without 
proper contact, there would be no sufficient force 
required to prevent abrupt relative motion between the 
body and chassis systems.  
The torque value of the screws is one of key controlled 
processes.  Therefore, the frequency of incorrect torque 
applied to the system is low.     
For factor 2, the sequence of tightening the screws 
affects the torque balance among the 4 screws.  The 
unbalance torque would cause uneven contact between 
the rubbing plates and friction blocks and lead the 
vibration and noise.  A 2-stage securing sequence was 
defined to follow.  In the first stage, secure the torque up 
to 85% value of the torque specification in the sequence 
shown in Figure 10.  And then torque all of screws to the 
targeted torque specification value in the same 
sequence.   
The sequence of securing the screws is one of key 
controlled processes.  The frequency of incorrect 
sequence used is low. 
For factor 3, the bolts are used to secure the friction 
block bases to the inner slewing ring.  This is done prior 
the friction plates secured by the screws, factor 1.  Due 
to the assembly sequence, factor 3 has little effect on 
duplicating the vibration and noise condition.   
For factor 4 and 7, the uneven distributed thicknesses of 
the friction blocks and rubbing plates cause uneven 
contact forces between the friction blocks and rubbing 
plates during turns.  The uneven contact condition 
becomes severer when the un-uniformity of thickness 
gets larger.  
The nominal thickness of the rubbing plates and fiction 
blocks is 8 mm.  The thickness should be no less than 6 
mm.  When the largest thickness difference among the 
three measured locations is bigger than 1 mm, the part 
should be replaced or processed.     
For factor 8, the warping/deformation of the rubbing 
plates affects the contact condition between the rubbing 
plates and friction blocks.  As the warpage of the plates
