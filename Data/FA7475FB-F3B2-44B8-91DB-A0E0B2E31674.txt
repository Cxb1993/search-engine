characteristic is not influenced by the capping 
layer. The strength of our concept in particular 
lies in the fact that the optical and the electrical 
device performance can be optimized separately. 
 
三、研究方法： 
In this work, we report a detailed 
investigation of the cathode capping layer 
influence on device performance in tris-(8- 
hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3)-based 
transparent OLEDs. The device structure of 
transparent OLED is shown in Fig. 1. 
Pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with 
15Ω/□ is used as substrate, and followed by 
organic materials including 4, 4’, 4”-tris{N, 
(3-methyphenyl)-N-phenylamino}-triphenyamine 
(m-MTDATA) and N,N’-diphenyl-N, 
N’-bis(1-naphthyl-phenyl)-(1, 1’-biphenyl)-4, 
4’-diamine) (NPB) as hole injecting layer and 
hole transporting layer respectively. Emitting 
layer consist of Alq3 doped with 
10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-1, 1, 7, 7-tetramethyl-2, 3, 
6, 7-tetrahydro-1H, 5H, 11H-benzo[l]pyrano[6, 7, 
8-ij] quinolizin-11-one (C545T). Undoped Alq3 
is used as electron transporting layer onto 
emitting layer, and semi-transparent samarium 
(Sm) then deposited as cathode. Finally, the 
OLED structure capped with different materials 
including zinc selenide (ZnSe), tungsten oxide 
(WO3), tellurium oxide (TeO2), and silicon oxide 
(SiO).  
The device fabricated by using high vacuum 
(<10-6 Torr) thermal deposition method. The 
luminance-current density (L-J) is measured 
using the PR650 spectroscan spectrometer with 
Keithley 2400 programmable voltage-current 
source. The average roughness is measured by 
the atomic force microscope (AFM) (Digital 
Instrument 3100). 
 
四、重要結果與討論： 
Fig. 2 shows the L-J characteristics of the 
four types of samples with individual optimal 
thickness. Device using WO3 as capping layer 
material get higher luminance than others. The 
maximum luminance value is 5300 cd/m2 when 
thickness of WO3 is 100 nm. The measurement of 
transmittance of four different capping layer 
materials is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that 
the transmittance of WO3 with 100 nm thickness 
is about 95% for 550 nm, and this is the highest 
value of all samples. It also shows that the 
transmittance of SiO is inferior to WO3. It is 
suggested that transparency of capping layer 
material is relative to luminance performance of 
TOLEDs. In other word, device with higher 
transparent capping layer get better luminance 
performance. Hence, the capping layer based on 
highly transparent materials such as WO3 are 
desirable to reduce the loss result from light 
absorption. 
It is suggested that the different luminance
