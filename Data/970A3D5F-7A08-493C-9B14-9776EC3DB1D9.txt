Abstract 
     A new Schottky diode, Al/p-GaSe was presented at this project.  It shows an effective barrier 
height of 0.96eV with an ideality factor of 1.24 last over five decades and a reverse leakage current 
density of 4.12×10-7 A/cm2 at -2V after rapid thermal annealing at 400°C for 30 sec.  The 
generation-recombination effect of the Schottky diode was decreased as the annealing temperature 
was increased.  The formation of Al1.33Se2 was observed by X-ray diffraction analysis after the diode 
was annealed at 400 °C for 30 sec.  Owing to the grains growth, the surface morphology of the 
400°C-annealed diode was rougher than that of the unannealed diode, which was observed both by the 
AFM and the SEM analysis.  The diode characteristic was also discussed by current- 
voltage-temperature (I-V-T) measurement.  The forward I-V-T data reveals a decrease at the barrier 
height, but an increase at the ideality factor with decreasing in measurement temperature.  The 
Richardson plot showed activation energy of 0.26eV at high temperature region, while showed a 
lower energy of 0.07eV at low temperature region.

and 400°C, respectively for 30 sec.  The ohmic 
contact on the back side of GaSe substrate was 
then formed by soldering high-purity indium.   
Current-voltage (I-V) characteristic was 
measured at room temperature by using an 
HP-4145B semiconductor parameter analyzer.  
The rectified characteristics, including Schottky 
barrier height, ideality factor and reverse leakage 
current were evaluated.  The XRD was used to 
identify the variation of phases after the diode 
was treated at different temperature annealing. 
Both SEM and AFM were used to observe the 
surface morphology of the diodes. 
 
4. Results and discussion 
The effective barrier height φb and 
ideality factor n, were determined by using the 
thermionic emission current voltage expression:

constant, φb is the effective Schottky barrier 
height (SBH) at zero bias, and n is the ideality 
factor.  Theoretical A** value of 247 Acm-2K-2 
was used for GaSe.  The value is based on 
effective electron mass using mn=0.5mo.  The 
ideality factor is derived from ( )[ ]JVkTqn ln// ∂∂= .Figure 1 shows the 
forward characteristics of the Al/p-GaSe contact.  
The saturation current density, Js, is 4×10-10 
A/cm2 for the as deposited contact, is 7×10-10 
A/cm2 for the 300°C annealed contact and is 
2×10-9 A/cm2 for the 400°C annealed contact.  
Their effective Schottky barrier height is 0.99eV, 
0.98eV and 0.96eV for the as deposited, 
300°C-annealed, and 400°C-annealed contacts, 
respectively.  The formation of the barrier arose 
from when the metal was contact to GaSe, 
electron flow from the metal into the 
semiconductor till the Fermi levels on the two 
sides are aligned.  These electrons are minority 
carriers in the p-type GaSe.  After reaching the 
semiconductor they recombine with holes giving 
rise to a space charge layer of ionized acceptor 
layer.  The space charge region yielded a 
diffusion barrier at the contact interface.  The 
ideality factor of the as-deposited contact is 2.1, 
of the 300°C-annealed contact is 1.84 and of the 
400°C-annealed contact is 1.24.  The ideality 
factor reveled that the as-deposited contact 
shows recombination effect during forward bias.  
As the annealing temperature was increased, the 
ideality factor more close to 1.  This indicates 
that the surface states were passivated and 
generation-recombination effects were decreased 
after the thermal annealing.

contact. 
 
Fig. 2 shows the reverse characteristics of the Al/p-GaSe 
contacts after different temperature annealing. 
For the reverse bias current-voltage

image-force induced barrier lowering, the

increased to the annealing temperature of 400°C, 
many small bulges was observed at the surface. 
The Al/p-GaSe showed better electrical 
characteristics after it was treated with RTA 
annealing.  These annealings passivated the 
interface states of the contact interface.  The 
generation-recombination effect of the diode 
which was response to the bias voltage was 
degraded.  It was conformed by the observation 
of the ideality factor at forward bias and by the 
lowering of the leakage current density at 
reverse bias of the annealed diodes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figs. 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) show the SEM pictures of the as 
deposited diode, the 300°C-annealed diode, and the 
400°C-annealed diode, respectively. 
 
The I-V-T characteristics of the as 
deposited diode and 300°C-annealed diode are 
shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively.  The 
measurement temperatures were performed from 
198 to 373K.  The two figures showed a 
decreasing of saturation current density, Js, as 
the measurement temperature was decreased.  
Both the ideality factor and effective barrier 
height of each measurement results were derived 
by the equations mention above.

Fig.10 The relationship between effective barrier height 
and ideality factor of the as deposited Al/p-GaSe diode 
and the 300°C-annealed Al/p-GaSe diode, respectively, at 
different measured temperature. 
Figure 11 shows the Richardson plots 
ln(Js/T2) vs 1000/T of the as deposited 
Al/p-GaSe diode and the 300°C-annealed 
Al/p-GaSe diode, respectively.  The results 
obtaining from the plotting is found to be 
nonlinear at the measured temperature, but they 
have got two groups of straight lines with 
different slopes.  This implies that the effective 
barrier is dependent upon temperature, and two 
different current transport mechanisms may 
dominate in this temperature range.  Under 
forward bias and for the measurement 
temperature was above room temperature, the 
data of the two diodes can be fitted with a 
straight line, respectively.  The corresponding 
activation energy was evaluated which is 0.32eV 
for the as deposited diode and is 0.27 eV for the 
300°C annealed diode.  As the measurement 
temperature below 300K, the diode showed 
smaller activation energy.  For the as deposited 
diode, the value of activation energy is 0.05 eV.  
For the 300°C -annealed diode, the 
corresponding activation energy is 0.067 eV.  
These results speak for that the predominant 
current transport is not only the thermionic 
emission. 
 
Fig.11 Richardson plots of the as deposited Al/p-GaSe 
diode and the 300°C-annealed Al/p-GaSe diode, 
respectively. 
The Schottky contact on the p-GaSe crystal had 
been realized by evaporating the metal Al.  The 
diode showed large value of ideality factor (n>1), 
which could attribute to the interface states at the 
contact interface and give rise to the 
generation-recombination currents within the 
space charge region.  The interface states of the 
diode could be passivated through RTA 
annealing.  As the annealed temperature 
increased the effect of passivation on the 
interface states increased.  So the diode showed 
an ideality factor of 2.1 on the as deposited 
sample while it decreased to 1.7 after it passed 
through 300°C annealing.  The diode also 
showed similar Schottky characteristics after the 
observation of I-V-T measurement.  For the 
300°C-annealed diode, its effective Schottky 
barrier height increased from 0.4eV to 1.04 eV 
as the measured temperature increased from 
198K to 373K.  This is based on the 
assumption of thermionic emission model in the 
whole measured temperature.  While, as we 
analyzed the I-V-T characteristics from the 
Richardson plots, we found that there are two 
groups of activation energy.  This speak for that 
there are two different current transport 
mechanisms during the bias.  The thermionic 
emission model didn’t dominant in the whole 
temperature range.  Due to the inhomogeneous 
contact interface and the existence of the patches 
on the junction, the carrier could pass through 
the junction by field emission at low temperature.  
As the measured temperature was increased, 
more carriers gained the energy to surmount the 
barrier.  There carriers pass through the 
junction by thermionic emission. 
5. Conclusion 
A new Schottky diode, Al/p-GaSe was 
realized in the research.  It showed an effective 
Schottky barrier height of 0.94eV with an 
ideality factor of 1.24 at the 400°C-annealed 
diode.  The contact interface of the diode was 
passivated after thermal annealing.  The 
passivation gave rise to a lower reverse leakage 
current and a better ideality factor.  A new 
phase of Al1.33Se2 was formed and the surface 
became rough after the thermal annealing. The 
temperature dependent of current-voltage 
characteristics was discussed. At the higher 
temperature region, the current transport was 
dominant by thermionic emission mechanism.  
While field emission process occurred at the 
lower temperature measurement, they gave rise
