was still in dispute. The conventionality was that 
the bladder smooth muscle was inactive, and the 
EUS should be tonically active to maintain urethral 
closure. Thus, the primary aim of this research is to 
investigate which of the EUS and bladder would 
play an active role in urine storage. Furthermore, 
we would like to find out the quantitative measures 
using fractal dimensions and power spectra that 
could characterize this storage phase under 
autonomic and somatic innervations.  
 
三、結果與討論 
 
In order to explore the roles played by the bladder 
and EUS, one complete cycle of storage and 
micturition was exemplified first. The EMG, CMG 
signals, their fractal dimensions and spectral 
frequencies for the cycle were studied first. The 
EMG and CMG signals of a typical female Wistar 
rat were depicted with black color (Fig. 1a and 1b). 
We denoted the fractal dimensions of both EMG 
and CMG by color codes. The green color code was 
used to denote the values of D between 1.5 and 2.0, 
and blue color code for D between 1.0 and 1.5. The 
fractal dimension of EMG exhibited dark blue 
patterns during voiding within the range of 20 to 25 
s. The fractal dimensions of CMG exhibited the 
same dark blue patterns during voiding within the 
range of 20 to 22.5 s. The detailed results during 
voiding phase were discussed in previous works. In 
this report, we would like to concentrate on the 
storage phase that was indicated by the time interval 
from 0 to 20 s. During storage, it was clear that both 
EMG and CMG were not of the same color. The 
fractal dimensions of EMG were greater than 1.5 
and depicted in the green color code. The fractal 
dimensions of CMG were smaller than 1.5 and 
depicted in the light blue color code.  
The power spectra of EMG and CMG in Fig. 1 
were calculated and displayed in Fig. 2. In this 
exemplary cycle, there were significant frequencies 
for EMG around 8 Hz only during micturition (Fig. 
2a). However, there was no significant frequency 
component during the storage phase. For CMG, 
there were significant frequencies around 8 Hz and 
19 Hz throughout the storage and micturition 
phases (Fig. 2b). Hence, the frequency components 
around 8 Hz were observed in both power spectra 
of CMG and EMG during micturition. However, 
the frequency components around 8 Hz and 19 Hz 
were observed only in CMG during the storage 
phase.  
Recall that the bladder was innervated by the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves; and the 
frequencies around 8 Hz were related to the 
parasympathetic innervations during micturition (4). 
It was also well-known that the frequency 
components derived from the sympathetic 
innervations were two to three times faster than the 
parasympathetic ones. Hence, it is evident that the 
frequency components around 19 Hz are actually 
derived from the sympathetic innervations.  
In order to further investigate the roles played by 
parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, 
magnitudes around 8 Hz and 19 Hz components in 
bladder and EUS during storage phase were 
calculated (Fig. 3). A period of eight seconds of 
EMG and CMG data records in Fig. 2 were adopted 
for convenience. The data records were then 
divided into 32 sets of data each with 0.25 second 
long. Each dataset of 0.25-second duration had 125 
points according to our sampling rate. The 
contributions around 8 Hz and 19 Hz from both 
EMG and CMG were normalized as follows. The 
average amplitudes of 8 Hz and 19 Hz components 
for EMG during each 0.25-second storage phase 
were denoted by es8 and es19, respectively. The 
corresponding average amplitudes around 8 Hz and 
19 Hz components for CMG during 0.25- second 
storage phase were denoted by cs8 and cs19,

Abstract 
Phytomedical clinical effects are the most important ingredients in Traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices are only secondary or 
tertiary. In this paper, based on existing research, compared to foreign literature, this issue 
was discussed. The results showed that during the pharmacodynamics experiments, the main 
target should be selected at the end, which can reflect and grasp the overall efficacy of 
dynamic processes in vivo. Recently, a temporal “coherent” fractal structure and 
synchronization of rhythms were proposed as two essential indicators for efficient voiding 
during micturition in female rats. These two criteria could be used in the dynamical 
performance evaluation of the pharmacological effects on micturition in spinal cord-injured 
rats. In this paper, capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (RTX) were administered and their effects 
were compared. Results based on the aforementioned criteria indicate that the synergy of 
bladder and external urethral sphincter during micturition by using RTX is better than that of 
the capsaicin. This methodology of performance evaluation would be helpful in assessing the 
functional effects of pharmacology in animals under dynamical diseases.

According to the definition of dynamical diseases, human body is a complex 
dynamical system full of various kinds of rhythms. These rhythms will not only 
interact among themselves, but also interact with the external environment. 
Dynamical disease is defined as the condition that the rhythms disappear or they 
are out of normal boundary. Under such conditions, the body is not in harmony and 
it is imperative to use the techniques of signal processing in examining the normal 
and pathological conditions. The achievement of this year is concentrated on the 
detailed study of autonomic nervous functions to see if there is cooperative 
co-activation in addition to the synergic innervations.  
 
So far, we have shown that blood pressure is a random field. In the paper, we have 
also shown that it is a blood distribution problem instead. Hence, it is important 
not only theoretically but also clinically to realize the cooperative behavior
