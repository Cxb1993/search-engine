Abstract 
The nullor-mirror pathological elements are used for modeling active elements. They are applied 
to linear circuit analysis, non-linear circuit analysis, CAD software, synthesis of linear circuits and 
filters, nullors and circuit transposition, the realization of inverse transfer functions, the transform to 
get low-sensitivity circuit and symbolic analysis. 
Because the mirror elements are helpful in representing the active devices with lower circuit 
complexity, the nullor-mirror equivalent of a circuit could be simpler than the nullor equivalent of a 
circuit. The floating mirror elements are used to ideally represent various popular analog 
signal-processing properties that involve differential or multiple single-ended signals. In this study, 
we make good use of our background knowledge about the reported symbolic nodal analysis and 
develop a mean of symbolic analysis based on all pathological elements (including floating mirror 
elements). The proposed analyzed method performs modified nodal analysis directly without 
replacing the mirror elements with their nullor-equivalents. We successfully developed an effective 
analytical way to reduce the system order of the analyzed circuit such that the performance of 
symbolic analysis has been enhanced.

然而，文獻[7-8]只考慮參考點接地的 Pathological Mirror 元件，Floating Mirror Element
並無法用於其所提出之符號節點分析上，為了符號分析包含 Floating Pathological Mirror 元件

Floating Mirror 元件的 Nullor 等效電路來作符號分析，並發表於期刊中[12]。然而[12]中之電
路複雜度與 Nullor-Floating Mirror 等效電路相較，仍嫌太過複雜，這將降低符號分析效率，

delete row l of the nodal equations. The number of columns of the B matrix is thereby 
reduced by one. This operation is based on the current property of a norator in Table 1(b).  
Step 7: For a CM that is connected between the nodes n and o, for example, subtract the equation in 
row o from the equation in row n and delete row o of the nodal equations. This involves 
subtracting Io from In and the oth row of B from the nth row of B. If o is the ground node, 
simply delete row n of the nodal equations. Similar manipulation process can be applied to 
the two-output CM in Table 1(e). This operation is based on the current reversing property 
of the terminals of a CM in Table 1(d). It must be noted that the CM with more than one 
output terminals will conduce to removing only one nodal equation 
Step 8: For the pathological current replication cell with three ungrounded nodes x, y and z in Table 
2(c), add the equation in row x to the equation in row y; subtract the equation in row x 
from the equation in row z and delete row x of the nodal equations. The above operation is 
based on the norator behavior between terminals x and y and the CM property between 
terminals x and z. Similar manipulation process can be applied to the cells in Tables 2(d) 
and (e). It must be noted that each current replication cell with more than one output 
terminals will conduce to removing only one nodal equation. 
Step 9: The preceding steps 4-8 incur the reduction of the order of the system of equations derived 
in step 3. Then we can solve the simplified combined equations for the unknown node 
voltages in V.

1 Introduction
The nullor elements (i.e., the nullator and the norator) are quite useful in the synthe-
sis and analysis of active networks [7, 9, 10, 16, 18, 24–26, 29]. The main reasons
for the popularity of nullor elements are their ability to model active circuits inde-
pendently of the particular realization of the active devices and the simplicity with
which these circuits can perform modified nodal analysis (NA) or symbolic analysis
[25, 26]. Symbolic analysis of an analog circuit is a formal technique of producing
an expression that describes a certain behavioral aspect of the circuit. The expression
is represented by symbolic parameters such as the independent variable (time or fre-
quency) and the dependent variables (voltage and current) [6]. Symbolic analysis is
mainly used as an approach to gain insight into the behavior of circuits, to generate
analytical models for automated circuit sizing, and to perform applications requiring
the repetitive evaluation of circuit characteristics [32].
In 1999, two new pathological elements, i.e., the current mirror (CM) and volt-
age mirror (VM), were defined. The new defined pathological mirror elements are
basically used to represent active devices with current or voltage reversing proper-
ties. Each of the VM and CM symbols has a reference node, which is set to ground
[1, 2, 19]. Although these elements are two-port network elements, they are used as
two-terminal elements with the reference node unused. Their usefulness to circuit
synthesis has been demonstrated in the literature [14, 20, 21, 30]. Recently, the mir-
ror elements with grounded reference node have been extended to include the float-
ing mirror elements [13, 15, 23]. Some pathological sections which ideally represent
most popular analog signal processing properties involving differential or multiple
single-ended signals, like conversion between differential and single-ended voltages,
differential voltage conveying, and inverting current replication, are concisely con-
structed from floating mirror elements. The pathological sections of differential cur-
rent cells and differential current conveying cells are constructed from nullor and
mirror elements with grounded reference nodes. By using different combinations of
pathological sections and nullor-mirror elements, one can describe the ideal repre-
sentation of some modern active building blocks [13, 15].
Recently, because of the better flexibility and simpler configuration of modeling
active devices using a combination of nullor and mirror elements, a systematic analyt-
ical technique which performs direct analysis for nullor-mirror equivalent networks
has been reported [31]. Its improvement in increasing the efficiency of symbolic anal-
ysis has been further demonstrated in [17]. However, a limitation of these formulation
methods is that floating pathological element-based active device models cannot be
included in the formulation process. To perform symbolic NA on circuits containing
active devices with differential or multiple single-ended signal characteristics which
are modeled by floating pathological mirror elements [3, 27, 28], the nullor equiv-
alents of a differential voltage cell, a differential voltage conveying cell, and a cur-
rent replication cell are presented in this paper. The proposed nullor equivalents are
applied to the symbolic NA of practical circuit examples to demonstrate their use-
fulness. One can expect the symbolic analysis of schemes containing state-of-the-art
active building blocks, such as the balanced output second generation current con-
veyor (BO-CCII), the differential voltage current conveyor (DVCC), the differential

The BO-CCII, DVCC, BO-ICCII, and DDCC are present popular active building
blocks that have continually gained the acceptance of researchers as core active com-
ponents in circuit design [4, 8, 11, 12, 22, 33]. All four active building blocks have
differential or multiple single-ended signal characteristics and so can be modeled by
the pathological sections in Fig. 2 [13, 22]. The BO-CCII can be modeled with a nul-
lator and a pathological current replication cell. The DVCC can be represented with a
pathological differential voltage cell and a current replication cell [13]. The patholog-
ical description for the BO-ICCII employs a voltage mirror (with grounded reference
node) and a pathological current replication cell [22]. In addition, by observing the
terminal characteristics of the ideal DDCC [4], it is found that the DDCC can be de-
scribed by a pathological differential voltage conveying cell and a current replication
cell. Using the nullor representations of the pathological sections in Fig. 2, we can
obtain the ideal nullor-mirror representations of the above active devices, as shown
in Fig. 3. Note that the pathological sections in Fig. 2 with simpler structures are se-
lected to describe the active devices in Fig. 3 to reduce the circuit complexity. Also,
for physically realizable circuits, all the voltages and currents are always uniquely
and definitely determined. This infers that, in the ideal representation of a physically
realizable circuit, nullators (or VMs) and norators (or CMs) must occur in pairs to
model the behavior of active devices [13, 22]. Observe that all the active devices in
Fig. 3 encompass pairs of nullators (or VMs) and norators (or CMs).

The all-pass filter in Fig. 2 of [12] is redrawn here in Fig. 4, and the DVCC is rep-
resented by its nullor equivalent in Fig. 3(b). By denoting the current flow through
all norators in Fig. 4 and applying the routine NA, we can build the nodal admittance
equation for each node. All the equations can be expressed in matrix form (I = YV)
as shown below:

The analyzed results are consistent with the expression in equation (3) of [12]; thus,
the validity is verified.
The second application example, taking into account the DDCC+-based design
in Fig. 2(a) of [8], is a voltage-mode second-order lowpass filter. The DDCC+ is a
five-terminal active device with terminal characteristics expressed by

In order to represent the DDCC+ with a simpler circuit structure for symbolic analy-
sis, the DDCC+ is modeled by the pathological differential voltage conveying cell in
Fig. 2(a) and a current mirror, as shown in Fig. 5. The whole voltage-mode lowpass
filter in Fig. 2(a) of [8] is also described in Fig. 5 with its inputted voltage source re-
placed by its equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuit contains current input in place
of voltage input for achieving symbolic NA, as shown in Fig. 6 [25]. Similarly, we
can write the nodal admittance equations in matrix form (I = YV) as in (6).

The analyzed results are in accordance with the circuit functions in [8]. Also, it can
be found that the nullor equivalents of the pathological differential voltage conveying
cell in Fig. 2(a) can be used to perform direct analysis for nullor-mirror equivalent
networks [17, 31].
4 Conclusion
In this paper, the simplified nullor equivalents of pathological sections of a differen-
tial voltage cell, a differential voltage conveying cell, and a current replication cell
are presented. They can be used to represent many popular active building blocks
with the characteristics of differential or multiple single-ended signals for perform-
ing symbolic analysis. The proposed nullor equivalents, making use of the available
floating mirror models of pathological sections in the literature, are compatible with
the recently reported symbolic analysis approach [17, 31]. The proposed represen-
tations of pathological sections with nullor networks also allow them to be used for
symbolic analysis CAD programs, such as CASCA [5].

Abstract: In this paper, a novel signal processing circuit which can be used for the 
measurement of H
+
 ion and urea concentration is presented. A potentiometric method is 
used to detect the concentrations of H
+
 ions and urea by using H
+
 ion-selective electrodes 
and urea electrodes, respectively. The experimental data shows that this measuring 
structure has a linear pH response for the concentration range within pH 2 and 12, and the 
dynamic range for urea concentration measurement is in the range of 0.25 to 64 mg/dL. 
The designed instrumentation circuit possesses a calibration function and it can be applied 
to different sensing electrodes for electrochemical analysis. It possesses the advantageous 
properties of being multi-purpose, easy calibration and low cost.

1. Introduction 
The prototype of biosensors was first proposed by Clark and Lyon in 1962 [1]. The analytical 
method of detecting organisms actually exploits the molecular recognition between enzyme and acceptor. 
This concept involves placement of an enzyme in close proximity to an electrode surface, where the

of an 8-bit microprocessor chip module (P89C51RB2HBA, Philips), an analog to digital converter 
(ADC), a liquid crystal display module (LCM) and a precision voltage amplifier. The voltage amplifier 
is implemented by an instrumentation amplifier (IA) to make good use of its characteristics of  
low-noise, high input impedance, low output impedance and tunable gain of the instrumentation 
amplifier. The commercially available pH meter usually set the zero potential which corresponds to  
pH 7. One unit change of pH value corresponds to the voltage change of about 59.1 mV. In theory,  
pH 14 to pH 0 will have the voltage from −413.7 mV to +413.7 mV.  
For the proposed system in Figure 3, the ADC (ADS7841, Texas Instruments) is a single-supply 
chip, and the input voltage range of analog channel is a positive voltage between 0 V to 5 V. Thus the 
low-offset voltage and input bias current, high linearity and low gain error IA (LT1167, Linear 
Technology) with positive reference potential bias is used to construct the instrument, as shown in 
Figure 4. The positive reference potential bias can be obtained with a level-shift circuit. To calibrate 
the system and maximize the measurement range, the designed instrument has default setting that the 
output voltage of the IA for potential 2.5 V which corresponds to pH 7 of the buffer solution and code 
2048 of ADC.

ADC is settable. By inputting the program with the correct code of ADC (which is obtained by 
measuring the buffer solution of pH 7) from the COM port in designed electrochemical sensing 
instrumentation, the calibration can be attained. Therefore, the temperature calibration function can be 
achieved by this designed circuit. In addition, the designed program in P89C51 has the reset function. 
It adopts the mean of 50 output codes of ADC to process when the reset function is triggered.

Moreover, the urea biosensor circuit is constructed. The similar potentiometric method is used for 
the concentration measurement of urea solutions by using urea electrodes. The urea solution with

The differences between the concentration measurement instrument for H
+
 ion and urea are the 
different sensing electrodes and the internal program of P89C51. For setting the instrumentation, the 
five urea solutions with concentrations of 8 mg/dL (a), 12 mg/dL (c), 16 mg/dL (e), 24 mg/dL (g) and  
32 mg/dL (i) are used for calibration, as shown in Figure 6. It also shows the measured potential 
difference for different urea solutions. We can observe that the output voltages are increased with the 
higher concentration of urea solutions.

By inputting the microprocessor with the derived code after the electrode was immersed in the PB 
solution to replace the default code 1000 of ADC, the reset function is attained. It must be noted that 
the selected IA, ADC and microprocessor chips for the realization of this designed instrument are 
based on the considerations of appropriate accuracy, low cost and easy modification and debugging for 
experimental demands. 
3. Experimental Results 
The designed circuit for practical measurement is shown in Figure 8. It is used to measure  
the concentrations of hydrogen ion and urea by using the H
+
 ion-selective electrodes and urea 
electrodes, respectively.  
Figure 8. The designed electrochemical sensing instrumentation. 
 
To achieve better accuracy, three-point calibration was adopted for our experimental measurement. 
The buffer solutions of pH 7, 10, and 4 were used for calibration based on interpolation and 
extrapolation techniques. From the measured voltages for the buffer solutions of pH 7 and 10, we 
obtained the pH sensitivity of 53.8 mV/pH. Similarly, from the measured voltages for the buffer 
solutions of pH 7 and 4, we obtained the pH sensitivity of 58.7 mV/pH. These two values were 
inputted into the designed program in P89C51. Using the calibrated system to measure the pH values 
of different solutions, the result is shown in Figure 9. The circle symbol is obtained by using 
commercially available pH meter (MP-512) for concentration measurement of hydrogen ion. The 
square symbol is obtained using our designed instrument. The measurement results in Figure 9 confirm 
the feasibility of the designed system. The obtained standard deviations using our instrument and  
MP-512 are 4.16 and 1.56, respectively. The three-point calibration method can be further extended for 
multi-point calibration to achieve higher accuracy.

Urea concentation (mg/dL)

The square of the sample correlation coefficient is 0.97 and the standard deviation is 1.82. Although 
there seems to be few points in the linear range, the non-linear problem can be solved using 
interpolation to calculate the measured voltages with microprocessor chip. By the blank determination 
method [12], the average output value of 1.2 mV and standard deviation of 0.6 mV were obtained for 
the blank, as shown in Figure 10(b). The limit-of-detection (LOD) and limit-of-quantification (LOQ) 
in this study are 0.25 mg/dL and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively. The concentration of urea nitrogen of  
1 mg/dL is equivalent to a concentration of urea of 2.14 mg/dL. For a normal person, the concentration 
of urea nitrogen is in the range of 6 mg/dL to 24 mg/dL. Thus the system with measured concentration 
range of the urea in Figure 10 can be used for basic biomedical examinations. 
4. Conclusions 
An electrochemical potential measurement instrument using a potentiometric method is designed in 
this paper. It is applied to the concentration measurements of pH value and urea by connecting 
hydrogen ion-selective electrodes and urea electrodes. The urea concentration is obtained by virtue of 
the measurement of hydrogen ion concentration of solution after the reaction of urea sensing electrode 
and urea solution. Its feasibility and accuracy are considered by practical measurements. In the  
same way, with different sensing electrodes, the instrument can be used for the electrochemical 
measurement of different objects by slight adjustment of internal program. The instrument has the 
advantageous properties of multi-purpose, easy calibration and low cost. It could be further improved 
on volume, such as the integrated realizations of IA and ADC or IA, ADC and P89C51 microprocessor, 
since the operational amplifiers are the common core components for IA and ADC and these analog 
devices could be implemented in a single chip [13].

Abstract—The nullor equivalent of the transistor (MOSFET) 
with its second-order effects consideration is presented in 
this article. It can be used to perform symbolic small-signal 
analysis for various amplifiers. To obtain the simplified 
expressions of the transfer functions of amplifiers, only the 
dominant parasitic elements are considered in the analysis. 
The analyzed results are consistent with the analyzed results 
derive from the generic method using controlled sources 
models. The proposed approach provides the alternative of 
small-signal circuit analysis.  
Keywords-nullor equivalent; symbolic small-signal 
analysis; second-order effects  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The pathological elements had received much 
attention in the synthesis and analysis of active networks 
[1-7]. The main reasons for the popularity of pathological 
elements are their ability to model active circuits 
independently of the particular realization of the active 
devices and the simplicity with which these circuits can 
perform modified nodal analysis (NA) or symbolic 
analysis [7-10]. Symbolic analysis of an analog circuit is 
a formal technique of producing an expression that 
describes a certain behavioral aspect of the circuit. The 
expression is represented by symbolic parameters such as 
the independent variable (time or frequency) and the 
dependent variables (voltage and current) [11]. Symbolic 
analysis at the circuit level is mainly used as an approach 
to gain good insight into the behavior of circuits, to 
generate analytical models for automated circuit sizing, 
and to perform applications requiring the repetitive 
evaluation of circuit characteristics [12]. 
Due to the convenience of performing symbolic 
analysis by applying only NA, the pathological elements 
are often used to model active devices [13-16]. Compared 
with the nodal admittance matrix formulation using the 
limit-variables method that a limit to infinity is always 
required to simplify the symbolic expressions [17-19], the 
symbolic NA using pathological element-based models 
shows the advantage of easier operational procedure 
[20-21]. 
The MOSFET can be modeled by using voltage 
controlled current sources (VCCS) or nullors. In [22], the 
nullor model of MOSFET was proposed and it is used to 
perform symbolic analysis of low voltage amplifiers. 
However, the proposed MOSFET model did not include 
the body effect. It is known that the triple well mask 
maybe unavailable in mixed-signal circuit design to lower 
the additional mask or chip area costs. Thus the body of 
an MOS transistor is connected to a constant 
power-supply voltage, which is a small-signal or ac 
ground. Nevertheless, the source connection may have a 
significant ac voltage impressed on it, which changes the 
body-source voltage when the body voltage is fixed. 
Therefore, when the body-source voltage is not constant, 
the body transconductance should be considered for 
MOSFET modeling.  
In this paper, the nullor equivalent of the MOSFET 
with its second-order effects consideration is presented. It 
is used to perform symbolic analysis of various amplifiers. 
Some similar amplifiers in [22] are illustrated to obtain 
more detailed analyzed results. 
II. MOSFET MODELING AND SYMBOLIC NA 
The pathological equivalents of several active devices 
can be found in the literature [2]. For the MOSFET, its 
nullor equivalent including the parasitic gate-source and 
gate-drain capacitance, output conductance and 
tramsconductance is shown in Fig. 1. To consider the 
more complete small-signal model of an MOSFET, the 
body effect is included, as shown in Fig. 2. The nullor 
equivalent in Fig. 2 constitutes complete set of 
pathological pairs. Therefore, the proposed nullor 
equivalent can be used for the reported symbolic NA 
technique [20, 23]  
It is known that the parallel connection of a nullator 
and a transconductance is equivalent to a nullator, and a 
series connection of a nullator and a norator is equivalent 
to an open circuit. In Fig. 2, it can be observed that when 
the terminals B and S are short, the model in Fig. 2 
becomes the model in Fig. 1 since the voltage across 
body transconductance (gmb) is zero. Thus the 
correctness of the nullor equivalent in Fig. 2 is verified.

Applying the similar symbolic NA method, the NA 
formulation can be expressed as in Eq. (4). the symbolic 
expression for the differential and common-mode transfer 
functions of the amplifier can be expressed as Eqs. (5) and 
(6), respectively. The typical frequency response of the 
Miller amplifier is given in Fig. 7.

The third example considers the three-stage 
uncompensated amplifier, as shown in Fig. 8. It includes 
the input differential amplifier, common-source amplifier 
and source follower. It can be observed that the M1, M2 
and M10 suffer from body effects. The nullor 
representation of the circuit in Fig. 8 is shown in Fig. 9. 
All the parasitic capacitors are removed because the 
dominant poles are given by Cp1, Cp2 and CL. Thus the 
related output conductances of transistors should be 
 
considered. In Fig. 9, the output conductance of M6 is 
also considered as it affects the common-mode response 
of the amplifier. All other output conductances of 
transistors are ignored.
