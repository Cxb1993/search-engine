英文摘要 
The project explores the mechanical stress 
issue on the highly scaled MOSFETs. Following are 
the eight main items to be conducted along with 
state-of-the-art CMOS scaled technologies: 
1. Fabricate n- and p-type highly scaled MOSFETs 
by advanced process technologies, followed by 
I-V/C-V characterization as well as our developed 
1-D quantum mechanical I-V/C-V simulation to 
extract key process parameters. 
2. Perform a two-dimensional process/mechanical 
stress simulator to extract the magnitude and 
distribution of strain and determine its 
property. 
3. Experimentally define mechanical stress 
conditions in terms of strain expressed as 
function of process parameters, FET scaling 
factor, and distance between gate to STI (shallow 
trench isolation) edge. 
4. Perform our developed 1-D quantum mechanical 
simulators to assess 2-dimensional electron (hole) 
gas and sub-band distributions, leading to 
extraction of relevant parameters like mobility. 
Establish theoretical framework of mechanical 
stress and develop analytic model of strain. 
5. Perform low-temperature experiment to extract 
channel backscattering coefficients and relate 
them to mechanical stress. 
6. Establish 2-D quantum mechanical ballistic 
simulators. 
7. Perform low frequency noise and random 
telegraph signal experiment to detect some change 
in mechanical stress. 
8. Incorporate mechanical stress into SPICE 
MOSFET model and perform simulation on functional 
circuit blocks. 
  The goal of the project is to clarify the 
impact of mechanical stress on next generation 
MOSFETs and the underlying mesoscopic physical 
mechanisms. Meanwhile, incorporation of mechanical 
stress into SPICE MOSFET model enables correct IC 
design and as a result, we can reach a a complex, 
highly dense SOC design effectively free of the 
harmful mechanical stress.

Effect of uniaxial strain on anisotropic diffusion in silicon

Received 9 June 2006; accepted 30 August 2006; published online 17 October 2006
A physical model is directly extended from the thermodynamic framework to deal with anisotropic
diffusion in uniaxially stressed silicon. With the anisotropy of the uniaxial strain induced activation
energy as input, two fundamental material parameters, the activation volume and the migration
strain anisotropy, can be quantitatively determined. When applied to boron, a process-device
coupled simulation is performed on a p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor
undergoing uniaxial stress in a manufacturing process. The resulting material parameters have been
found to be in satisfactory agreement with values presented in the literature. © 2006 American

Strain engineering has been widely recognized as an in-
dispensable performance booster in producing next-
generation metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
MOSFETs.1,2 There have been two fundamentally different
methods used to achieve this goal:1,2 i biaxially strained
silicon on a relaxed SiGe buffer layer and ii uniaxially
strained silicon through the use of trench isolation, silicide,
and cap layers during the manufacturing process. However,
diffusion in strained silicon is essentially different from that
of unstrained silicon. Thus, an understanding of strain depen-
dent diffusion, as well as its control, is a challenging issue.
So far, there have been significant studies in this direction
covering a wide range of experimental findings and
confirmations,3–9 atomistic calculations,10–13 physical
models,10–16 and technology computer-aided design.17 Spe-
cifically, Cowern et al.5 experimentally revealed a linear de-
pendence of the activation energy on strain. Within the ther-
modynamic framework constructed by Aziz et al. see Ref.
18, which is more recent and more thorough than the earlier
works cited above, the activation volume V˜  and the aniso-
tropy of the migration volume V˜ m−V˜
m exist in nature. The
combination of the activation energy, the activation volume,
and the anisotropy of the migration volume is remarkable, as
demonstrated in a physical model14–16,18 dedicated to both
the hydrostatic pressure experiment and the in-plane biaxial
stress experiment,

where Q33−biax is the biaxial strain induced activation energy
in the direction normal to the silicon surface, Ybiax is the
biaxial modulus,  is the lattice site volume, and Q11−biax is
the biaxial strain induced activation energy in the direction
parallel to the surface.
On the other hand, in the case of uniaxial stress as en-
countered while fabricating the MOSFET, without the use of
a relaxed SiGe buffer layer, the stress is created through the
trench isolation, silicide, or cap layers in a manufacturing
process. Therefore, a straightforward extension to the
uniaxial strain counterpart is essential. In this letter, one such
model is derived and its linkage to the case of biaxial strain,
Eqs. 1 and 2, is established. When applied to boron, a
process-device coupled simulation is performed on a p-type
MOSFET undergoing uniaxial stressing during the manufac-
turing process, followed by a systematic assessment of the
fundamental material parameters.
According to Aziz14 and Aziz et al.,18 in the case of
equilibrium or a quickly equilibrated point defect, the effect
of stress on the dopant diffusivity in the direction normal to
a 001 surface can be written as

Here the product of the stress tensor  and the formation
strain tensor Vf is the work done against the stress field in
defect formation, the product of the stress tensor  and the
migration strain tensor V˜ 33
m is the work required for the tran-
sition in the migration path, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and
T is the diffusion temperature. The tensor Vf involves the
creation or annihilation of a lattice site, followed by a relax-
ation process,14,18

Prior to determining the fundamental material param-
eters, a systematic treatment, such as that indicated in Fig. 2,
is demanded. In Fig. 2 a series of straight lines of Q11−uniax vs
Q33−uniax are from Eqs. 9 and 10 for a literature
range15,16,18 of V˜ and the migration strain anisotropy A˜
V˜ m−V˜
m /.18 In the calculation procedure, the follow-
ing literature values were employed:19 i C11=168 GPa and
C12=65 GPa, giving rise to Yuniax=131 GPa and =0.28; ii
=2.2610−23 cm3. The above experimental parameters
are also added to the figure. From the figure a set of V˜ and A˜
can be clearly located around the data point. On the other
hand, uncertainties exist based on a series of literature data:
V˜ =−0.16±0.05 .18 Taking such uncertainties into account,
Fig. 2 reveals that the data point does match the upper limit,
that is, V˜ =−0.21 . The corresponding V˜ m−V˜m in the vicin-
ity of 0.15  is determined accordingly, falling within the
reasonable range.15,16,18 Such corroborating experimental
evidence further indicates that the transient enhanced diffu-
sion effect is relatively insignificant when compared to the
long-term diffusion times in the underlying manufacturing
process. Under such circumstances, the point defect is rap-
idly equilibrated relative to the entire diffusion time.
Finally, we quoted the existing ab initio calculations:12,13
Q11−biax =−19.2 eV per unit strain and Q33−biax =−13.9 eV per
unit strain, which were transformed via the aforementioned
relationship into the equivalent Q11−uniax of −8.77 eV per unit
strain and Q33−uniax of −4.975 eV per unit strain. In this pro-
cess, the Ybiax used was equal to 183 GPa according to
Ybiax= C11+C12−C12 with its Poisson’s ratio =2C12/C11.
Evidently, the two data points are quite comparable to each
other, as displayed in Fig. 2.
A physical model dealing with anisotropic diffusion in
uniaxially stressed silicon is derived and is quantitatively
connected to the biaxial case. A process-device coupled
simulation is performed on a p-type MOSFET undergoing
uniaxial stress during the manufacturing process. A system-
atic treatment is conducted and the resulting fundamental
material parameters are in satisfactory agreement with litera-
ture values.

of 0.11 m, represent three different positions on the wafer.
Apparently, a considerable variation of low-frequency noise
exists between devices, which can be attributed to statistical
fluctuations of the number of the interface traps.8 Hence, it is
argued that the measured noise data essentially can follow
the 1/ f relationship with the power coefficient  close to
unity.
Figure 3 shows measured SVg against channel width for a
certain gate overdrive of 0.6 V at a specific frequency of 100
Hz. In this figure, each of the five error bars represents the
standard deviation of the distribution created from a total of
fifteen samples; and the data point stands for the mean of the
distribution. This figure reveals that the low-frequency noise,
on the average, increases with decreasing channel width. We
also further conducted the case of varying gate overdrive and
found that no significant deviation from that in Fig. 3 can be
observed, provided that the gate overdrive of more than 0.4
V is applied.
Also shown in Fig. 3 is the corresponding average
threshold voltage shift with respect to the wide structure i.e.,
10 m such as to address the possibility of the inverse nar-
row width effect INWE caused by the impurity segregation
and the fringing electric field at the isolation sidewall.9,10 It
can be seen that the threshold voltage shift is rather small 
5% , indicating that the inverse narrow width effect is not
a significant issue in the undertaken devices. Furthermore,
since the noise data are obtained in strong inversion, the
channel current part along the edge of the channel is not
significant relative to the overall channel one. As a result, the
inverse narrow width effect can be substantially weakened.
Therefore, it is reasonably drawn that the present low-
frequency noise is a good tool to monitor the Si-SiO2 inter-
face over the whole channel area.
The weak dependence of low-frequency noise on gate
overdrive 0.4 V as mentioned above suggests that the
carrier number fluctuations prevail in the strong inversion
mode. In other words, under such situations the Coulomb
scattering can be ignored due to the screening of the trapped
charge by the gate electrode and the inversion-layer charge.

density expression can be adequately cited3,11

known Ceff1.75 F/cm2 from the undertaken manufac-
turing process, fitting of all the SVg data using Eq. 1 led to
the distribution of Nt as shown in Fig. 4 versus channel
width. Again on the average, the interface state density de-
creases with decreasing channel width. Specifically, a reduc-
tion in channel width by a factor of about 100 produces a
tenfold reduction in interface state density. Once again, a
reduction in channel width means an enhancement of tensile
strain in that direction; therefore, the present noise experi-
ment points to a reduction in interface state density in the
presence of enhanced tensile strain in the channel width
direction.
It is interesting to further examine the physical origin of
the underlying interface states. Analogous to the electron-

Coulomb energy is essential to the charging of a nanometer-scale trap in the oxide of a metal-oxide-
semiconductor system. Traditionally the Coulomb energy calculation was performed on the basis of an inter-
facelike trap. In this paper, we present experimental evidence from a 1.7-nm oxide: Substantial enhancements
in Coulomb energy due to the existence of a deeper trap in the oxide. Other corroborating evidence is achieved
on a multiphonon theory, which can adequately elucidate the measured capture and emission kinetics. The
corresponding configuration coordinate diagrams are established. We further elaborate on the clarification of
the Coulomb energy and differentiate it from that in memories containing nanocrystals or quantum dots in the
oxide. Some critical issues encountered in the work are addressed as well.

I. INTRODUCTION
In a metal-oxide-semiconductor MOS system, a Cou-
lomb barrier arises during the charging of a nanometer-scale
trap in the oxide. Thus, a critical energy to overcome the
barrier, namely, Coulomb energy, plays a vital role in the
capture kinetics.1,2 Traditionally the Coulomb energy was
calculated on the basis of an interfacelike trap. This treat-
ment essentially remains valid if the oxide used is much
thicker. However, with the currently aggressive downscaling
of the oxide thickness, the oxide trap is likely situated deeper
into the oxide from the SiO2/Si interface and therefore, the
Coulomb energy is expected to be affected due to enhanced
image charge. However, little work has been done in this
direction since the introduction of the Coulomb energy
concept.1,2 On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the defi-
nition of the Coulomb energy in the case of the oxide trap1,2
is significantly different from that in memories containing
nanocrystals or quantum dots in the oxide.3–6 However, such
a confusing issue has not yet been clarified.
In this paper, we exhibit experimental evidence for the
Coulomb energy enhancement in the presence of a deeper
oxide trap. The other corroborating evidence is achieved
based on a multiphonon theory with the configuration coor-
dinate diagrams taken into account. We further elaborate on
the clarification of the Coulomb energy in a MOS system
containing a nanometer-scale trap in the oxide and differen-
tiate it from that in a MOS memory containing a nanocrystal
or dot in the oxide, followed by a concrete discussion on the
critical issues encountered in the work.
II. EXPERIMENT
The n-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors MOSFETs with varying channel lengths and
widths 60 nm to 600 nm were fabricated in a state-of-the-
art manufacturing process. The key process parameters as
obtained by capacitance-voltage C−V fitting were n+ poly-
silicon doping concentration =1.31020 cm−3, gate oxide
thickness1.7 nm, and channel doping concentration
=81017 cm−3. To detect a potential oxide trap with fluctu-
ating occupancy, the random telegraph signals RTS mea-
surement is a good means.1,2,7–9 The RTS measurement-
equipment and method used were the same as that described
elsewhere.10 The operating conditions at room temperature
were VD=10 mV and with VG ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 V. The
purpose of the low voltage operation is twofold: i it can
ensure no extra trap created during the long-term RTS mea-
surement; and ii the devices under study can readily reduce
to a near-equilibrium one-dimensional1DMOS system. We
conducted extensive RTS measurement across the whole wa-
fer and found that as expected, the occurrence probability of
RTS events in underlying devices is extremely low. For those
devices identified with RTS, it was found that i the same
abrupt transitions between two distinct states in drain current
also simultaneously occur in source current; and ii no such
noticeable changes can be observed in gate or bulk current,
opposed to the recent literature11 with a smaller oxide thick-
ness 1.3 nm. Therefore, the RTS events encountered in
our work are due to the transfer of a single electron between
a certain process-induced defect in the oxide and the under-
lying conductive channel layer. The capture time associated
with the upper level of RTS current and the emission time
associated with the lower current level both were exponen-
tially distributed. The mean of the capture time distribution,
designated c, divided by the mean of the emission time dis-
tribution e is given in Fig. 1 against gate voltage for two
devices labeled Traps A and B. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the
corresponding time evolutions of RTS drain current at a cer-
tain gate voltage. Figure 1 reveals that while initially the
c /e ratio is comparable between Traps A and B, with gate
voltage increasing further, the Trap B’s c /e drops with a
faster rate than Trap A.
III. ANALYSIS AND PHYSICAL INTERPRETATIONS
The size of the trap under study must be significantly less
than the oxide thickness used 1.7 nm since no noticeable
change in the gate current was observed. Hence, the trap
responsible for the measured RTS in drain current is a
nanometer-scale trap. To explore the measured c /e, it is
necessary to know in advance the amount of the image or

gether and thereby the Coulomb energy can readily be writ-
ten as EQGVG.1,2 The calculated Coulomb energy is to-
gether plotted in Fig. 4, showing that the Coulomb energy
associated with the interface trap increases with gate voltage
until encountering a certain peak. However, such a peak
point disappears in the case of nonzero trap depth and the
Coulomb energy instead piles up over the conventional
value.
According to the principle of detailed balance with the
Coulomb energy included, the c /e ratio can read as1
c
e
= eET−EF+E/kBT. 2
In Eq. 2, the trap level ET relative to the quasi-Fermi
level EF is a function of gate voltage and can readily be
quantified using the Schrödinger-Poisson solver. The best
fitting results achieved using Eq. 2, with zT=0.7 nm
and EOX−ET=3.2 eV for Trap A and zT=0 nm and
EOX−ET=3.3 eV for Trap B, are shown in Fig. 1. Here EOX
denotes the oxide conduction band edge. Evidently, the fit-
ting quality is fairly good. The extracted EOX−ET values are
close to the SiO2/Si interface barrier height, as expected due
to the low voltage operation. It is hence argued that an inter-
face trap exists in the Trap B device while a 0.7-nm deep trap
in the oxide prevails in Trap A. In other words, the conven-
tional Coulomb energy appears to work well for the Trap B
device but leads to poor quality in fitting the Trap A data.
Such a remarkable difference in c /e between Traps A and B
can therefore serve as experimental evidence of the Coulomb
energy enhancement.
Other corroborating evidence can be obtained through the
fitting of the measured mean capture time versus gate voltage
as shown in Fig. 5. Since the capture kinetics involve the
thermal activation process at room temperature of operation,
a multiphonon emission theory was utilized to calculate the
capture time

3 yielded the lattice relaxation energy S	 of 1.2 and 0.025
eV for Traps A and B, respectively; and 0 of 2.0310−23
and 3.6610−22 m2 for Traps A and B, respectively. The
fitting quality is again good and the same parameters readily
reproduced the e data as depicted in Fig. 5. Specifically, the
extracted 0 values are physically reasonable from the view-
point of the penetration of the wave function into the oxide:
the capture cross section decreases with increasing trap depth
from the SiO2/Si interface. The extracted values of the lat-
tice relaxation energy also correctly reflect the status of the
trap: A deeper trap i.e., Trap A in our work is accompanied
with a higher lattice relaxation energy.14,15 Using the above
extracted results, we constructed a configuration coordinate
diagram of the underlying electron-lattice system as sche-
matically shown in Fig. 6 for both devices. Also plotted in
Fig. 6 are the MOS energy band diagrams removing the
polysilicon part in the flatband case, showing the spatial

channel conduction band edge to certain oxide depth zT plus
the subsequent multiphonon emission time such as to lower
the energy of the tunneling electrons to the same level as the
trap. One can estimate the tunneling time of around 10−9 sec
across zT of 0.7 nm Ref. 16 and can reasonably hypothesize
that the multiphonon emission time is a spontaneous event
as can be easily understood from the configuration coordi-
nate diagrams in Fig. 6; the hypothesis also works well for
the areas of the trap assisted tunneling, leading to a capture
time of the order of 10−9 sec. Obviously, the possibility of
the electron tunneling must in principle be removed since the
measured capture times fall within 0.5 to 6 sec. On the other
hand, once trapped the electrons may instantly tunnel to the
gate electrode, contributing to the gate current. In other
words, under such situations, no RTS in drain or gate current
can be detected due to the extremely slow detection process
in measurement setup. Moreover, in our work the gate cur-
rent was found to be several orders of magnitude less than
the drain current, indicating the absence of the electron tun-
neling in determining the experimental RTS drain current.
Note that the high and low levels of RTS current represent
the different stable states as denoted the free and bound state
in the configuration coordinate diagrams in Fig. 6. The de-
tailed balance essentially applies only to two such states,
rather than the abrupt transitions between the two. The cap-
ture and emission time constants represent the critical times
required to overcome the barrier height and reach the cross-
ing point, then instantly entering into the other stable state.
Eventually, the measured discrete switching RTS drain
current indicates that the transit time between the high and
low levels is substantially less than the integration time in
measurement setup.10 In other words, the abrupt transition
between two stable states represents a spontaneous event
with respect to the measurement setup. Hence, the corre-
sponding transient displacement current through the gate
electrode may escape detection. This explains why we saw
only a flat gate current level with typical thermal or shot
fluctuations around it over the whole observation time.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented experimental evidence concerning the
Coulomb energy enhancement in a MOS system with a
nanometer-scale oxide trap. Other corroborating evidence
based on a multiphonon theory has elucidated the measured
capture and emission kinetics. The corresponding configura-
tion coordinate diagrams have been established. We have fur-
ther elaborated on the clarification of the Coulomb energy
and have differentiated it from that in memories containing
nanocrystals as a floating gate. Some critical issues encoun-
tered in the work have been addressed as well.

strain. To investigate the transient enhanced diﬀusion, only
strain-dependent interstitial diﬀusion is needed. EC for
the vacancy extracted from calculation results12) is þ7:9
eV/unit strain. Extracted EC and ES values for the
interstitial are 7:0 and þ0:99 eV/unit strain, respectively.
Furthermore, interstitial diﬀusivity and equilibrium concen-
tration product, DIC

I , is reduced under the compressive
strain conditions. Two-dimensional (2D) process/device
simulators, TSUPREM4 and MEDICI, were employed.
The stress-dependent diﬀusion models were incorporated
into TSUPREM4 through its user-speciﬁed equation inter-
face.
A series of n-channel MOSFETs were fabricated using
state-of-the-art process technology. Test structures had three
active area length (Xactive in Fig. 1) values: 0.68, 1.46,
and 20.2 mm. Xactive is the design parameter to modulate
mechanical stress. The minimum Xactive dimension of 0.68
mm takes the presence of one contact window area in the
source/drain into account. The gate length and width were
0.17 and 10 mm, respectively. The retrograde well implanta-
tions are omitted so as to enhance the sensitivity of the
subthreshold characteristics to STI mechanical stress, oﬀer-
ing the opportunity to verify the validity of the above
mentioned diﬀusion model. The measured subthreshold I–V
characteristics at VD ¼ 1:2V are depicted in Fig. 2, with the
substrate bias as a parameter. Previous work13) revealed that
the substrate bias measurement is a suitable veriﬁcation
index of the MOSFET doping proﬁle because of the high
sensitivity of carrier diﬀusion current to the dopant proﬁle.
The procedure for obtaining ES values for various impu-
rities began by calibrating the one-dimensional dopant
proﬁles in blanket control wafers, using processes that
covered the range of device wafer process conditions. The
results were taken as stress-free dopant proﬁles and used to
calibrate the dopant diﬀusion parameters without consider-
ing stress-dependent diﬀusion eﬀect. 2D MOSFET struc-
tures were then simulated in conjunction with the mechan-
ical stress model. Calibrated diﬀusion parameters were
employed to simulate a large Xactive case, where the stress
level is negligible. All major front-end process steps from
the STI to the source/drain anneal were considered. The
corresponding simulation geometries were calibrated using
TEM cross-sectional images. Device simulations were
performed and the device model parameters were calibrated
to ﬁt the I–V of the large Xactive MOSFET. Next, the process
simulations based on VIDAESM for all Xactive values were
conducted with an initial set of ES values. Then, the device
simulations with smaller Xactive values were performed and
compared with the I–V data. The above procedure was
iterated until a satisfactory reproduction of subthreshold I–V
data was achieved in all cases.
The simulated strain distribution results for Xactive ¼ 0:68
mm are given in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the magnitude
of the total strain, or volume change ratio, "xx þ "yy, is
negative in the MOSFET core area, meaning that the device
experiences compressive stresses during the process. In
addition, the "xx þ "yy of Xactive ¼ 0:68 mm was found to
be much larger in magnitude than Xactive ¼ 20:2 mm. The
compressive stress stems mainly from the lower thermal
expansion rate of the STI oxide when compared to silicon, as
