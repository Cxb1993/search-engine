as for the active layer. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to observe the 
sizes and distribution of the QDs. The AFM observation showed that two sizes of 
QDs: were formed: 20 nm diameter by 7 nm height and 15 nm diameter by 4 nm 
height. The dot density, on an average, is about 5x1010/cm2. 
The implantation of the QDs wafer was carried out using an HVEE ion implanter 
(500kV) and an HVEE van de Graaf accelerator (3MV). The fluence ranged from 
1x1010/cm2 to 1x1013/cm2. The fluence rate was selected such that the irradiating 
duration was longer than 30 sec, to reduce the error of charge collection. Dose 
uniformity was achieved by scanning the ion beam. For MeV protons at low doses, 
the dose uniformity was monitored using a radio chromic film. 
To select the incident energies, SRIM 2003 (The Stopping and Range of Ions in 
Matter, 2003) was used to simulate the implantation of protons into our QD samples 
[6]. Table 1 lists the results of the simulation — the range, the active-layer-dose and 
the active-layer-displacements (the total damage in the active layer) — with respect to 
the incident energy. As shown in this table, the ratio of the implanted proton to the 
total damage falls into three distinct categories, we selected three incident energies at 
10keV, 100keV, and 1MeV. 
The PL measurement was carried out at low-temperature (25K), using the 514nm 
line of cw Argon ion laser for optical excitation. Figure 1 depicts one of the PL results 
at three different excitation powers. The figure shows that there are two PL peaks at 
the wavelengths of 1070nm and 1120nm, and these two resonance peaks always 
co-exists irrespective of the scale of the laser power. This indicates that they originate 
from two types of QDs with different ground states and not from one type of QDs 
with a single ground state and a single excited state. Thus, the PL spectra do 
characterize two different QD sizes, which was in accordance with the AFM 
observation. 
 
3. Proton passivation & photoluminescence enhancement 
As suggested by the active-layer-dose to damage ratio of protons in Table 1, PL 
enhancement due to proton passivation would be expected to be most significant in 
the 10 keV case and least significant in the 1 MeV case. However, from the PL 
measurement with fixed proton fluence, depicted in Figure 2, it was observed that no 
PL enhancement occurred (except Figure 2b). It appeared that no such trend of 
passivation could be correlated with the active-layer-dose. Particularly, in the 
low-fluence condition (Figure 2a), the PL in the 10keV proton implantation case was 
considerably lower that in the 100keV one. As indicated in Table 1, in the active layer, 
the displacements (damage) are considerably greater than the proton dose. Therefore, 
it could be inferred that a higher proton dose in the active layer might passivate more 
This implies that the QD size is important. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, as 
the fluence increases, the PL peak at the wavelength of 1120nm gets much decreased 
than that at the wavelength of 1070nm. That is, the dots of a larger size have a larger 
cross section to be eliminated by the high fluence of proton bombardment. 
Furthermore, as depicted in Figure 3c, the PL enhancement is significant in dots with 
a larger size. This implies that dots of a larger size are more sensitive to the point 
defects generated by proton bombardment. 
Figure 4 depicts a finer dependence of the PL measurement on the MeV-proton 
fluence, where the number of larger QDs is smaller in quantity because of a smaller 
PL peak in the wavelength of 1120nm. For larger size QDs (20nm in diameter), as the 
fluence (1x1010/cm2~1x1011/cm2) approaches the average dot density (5x1010/cm2), 
the PL due to larger QDs gets enhanced accordingly. PL gets most enhancement at the 
fluence of 1x1011/cm2 (average defect separation is about 32nm, (1/(1x1011/cm2))1/2 ~ 
32nm). Further, as the fluence gets beyond 3x1011/cm2 (average defect separation ~ 
18nm), the PL due to larger QDs decreases quickly. This indicates that too dense the 
fluence, the QDs begin to be destroyed directly. In contrast, the QDs of smaller size 
(15nm in diameter) exhibit a slight PL enhancement in the fluence of 1x1011/cm2 only 
(average defect separation is about 32nm), and get much PL reduction as the fluence 
is greater than 3x1011/cm2. 
Hence, with the help of QD size and defect separation, we can roughly 
characterize the evidence for the defect-assistant PL enhancement as follow: the PL 
enhancement occurs when the fluence is about the same order of magnitude as the 
average QD density, and it occurs only when the average defect separation is larger 
than the QD size. 
 
5. Concluding remarks 
According to PL measurements of proton-irradiated QDs samples with different 
active-layer proton doses, to characterize proton passivation, we find the necessity of 
matrix annealing to cure excess defects. And, for the defect-dominated samples, we 
have identified one another mechanism for PL enhancement !
