2.1 Experimental Configuration and Setup
2.1.1 Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB)
The Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (Fig. 2) is an adaptation of the device developed by Kolsky
[2]. It consists of a gas gun system, an incident bar, a transmitted bar and a specimen assembly. A
projectile fired from a gas gun impacts one end of the incident bar and generates a compressive
stress pulse propagating down the bar into the specimen. This pulse reverberates within the
specimen, sending a transmitted pulse into the transmitted bar and a reflected pulse back into the
incident bar. The bars are designed to remain elastic throughout the test so that the complete
displacement time and stress-time histories at the interfaces between the specimen and the bars can
be determined from measurements of the incident, reflected and transmitted pulses [3]. Figure 3
shows the SHPB facility built in KUAS. The length of the SHPB table is about 8 meters and the
incident and transmitted bars are made by 22mm diameter AL7075.

4. Results and Discussion
The experiment parameters were shown in Table 1. The duration of the compression pulses
was about 118μs for each experiment. Light pulse shaping was applied to ensure the proper
ramping during the rise-time of the incident pulse to produce a state of equilibrium in the hydrogel
specimens and also to prevent the specimens from damaging before the compression stress reached
equilibrium. The strain rate of the experiments were between 100~800 s-1. Figure 6 shows the
experiment result of Shot FAw013, in which the red line indicates the strain wave in incident bar
and the green line indicates the strain wave in transmitted bar. From these test results, the dynamic
bulk strength of the tested hydrogel specimens can be observed, as shown in Figure 7. It does not
exhibit obvious linear behavior when the hydrostatic compression increased. Higher compression
pulse experiments are necessary to further exam the dynamic response of the proposed hydrogel
material under extreme dynamic loading conditions.
