 
(CuKa1 radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA). XRD peak ﬁtting was ac-
quired according to the pseudo-Voigt proﬁle function.13 Crys-
tallite size was estimated from the XRD data using the Scherrer
equation.5 The lattice parameters of all samples were measured
by XRD using the reﬂection peak (111) with SiO2 powder as an
internal standard. For Raman spectroscopic characterization, a
532 nm wavelength laser-beam excitation light source (laser
power, 100 mW), focused using a  100 microscopic objective,
was used. The BET speciﬁc surface area was determined using a
standard nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique (Micro-
meritics ASAP2020, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA), with the
BET diameter calculated using
d ¼ 6
r A (1)
where d is particle diameter (mm), 6 is shape factor, r is particle
density (g/cm3), and A is BET speciﬁc surface area (m2/g).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CZa and
BCZa samples were obtained by Hitachi HF-2000 (Hitachi,
Santa Clara, CA) (FE-TEM), and the average grain size was cal-
culated from at least 30 grains with Lucia Measurement Software
Version 4.71. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra
were obtained with a PHI 5000 (ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki,
Kanagawa, Japan) system equipped with a monochromatic
AlKa X-rays under ultra-high vacuum (1 109 torr). Thermo-
gravimetric analysis (Netzsch STA 409 PC, Netzsch, Selb, Ger-
many) was used to characterize the OSC by monitoring the
weight changes under cyclic heat treatment in ﬂowing 21% O2/
N2 or N2.
26 The heat treatment cycle consisted of an initial heat-
ing to 8001C in N2, cooling to 1501C in 21%O2/N2, followed by a
second heating to 8001C in N2, then cooling to 1501C in 21% O2/
N2. All heating and cooling rates were 51C/min. The TG data
indicating sample weight gain after the second cooling were used
as measures of sample OSC at temperatures of 3001–8001C. The
OSCwas calculated by converting the sample to Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 g
1.
III. Results
(1) Phase Identiﬁcation
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of CZa and the BCZa series
calcined at 10001C for 2 h. A second phase (BaZrO3) was ob-
served when the Ba21 ions were added at levels 43 wt%. The
excess Ba21 ions reacted with CZ to form Ba(CexZr1x)O3 (0ox
o1) when Ba21 ion addition was above 10 wt%. Moreover, the
XRD peaks of CZ shifted to a lower angle with the addition of
43 wt% Ba21 ions. That shift was the result of the CZ being
transformed to a Ce-rich phase. Figure 2 shows the CZ (220)
XRD peak ﬁtting for CZa and 0.5BCZa calcined at 10001C for
2 h. CZa exhibited a nonsymmetrical peak shape indicating seg-
regation of the Ce- and Zr-rich phases (Fig. 2(a)). A symmetrical
peak appeared in the 0.5BCZa sample (Fig. 2(b)) indicating that
no distinct phase separation was observed, suggesting that the
addition of Ba21 ions can stabilize the CZ structure and prevent
phase separation.
The XRD patterns of CZa and the BCZa series calcined at
11001C for 2 h are shown in Fig. 3. A small side-peak in the
vicinity of the CZ (111) peak (2yB291) belonging to the Zr-rich
phase was observed. However, the Zr-rich peaks gradually dis-
appeared with increases in the addition of Ba21 ions. The second
phase (BaZrO3) appeared when Ba
21 ion addition reached 3
wt%, which is consistent with the results for the samples calci-
ned at 10001C for 2 h. It is signiﬁcant to observe that CZ phase
separation in samples calcined at 11001C could be inhibited by
the addition of Ba21 ions.
XRD is not sensitive to light elements (i.e., oxygen) in the
presence of heavy elements (i.e., cerium); thus, it is difﬁcult to
identify the c- and t00-phases of CZ based on XRD results alone.8
However, Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to tetragonal distor-
tions of oxygen positions and can be used to distinguish between
the c- and t00-phases of CZ.8,27,28 Figure 4 shows the Raman
spectra of CZa and the BCZa series calcined at 10001C for 2 h.
The CZa, 0.5BCZa, 1BCZa, and 3BCZa samples showed three
peaks, which belong to the Raman modes of the t00-phase of CZ.
However, in the 5BCZa, 10BCZa, and 20BCZa samples, only
single F2g modes of the cubic ﬂuorite structure at B470 cm
1
(attributed to the cubic Ce-rich phase) were observed. The full-
width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the F2g Raman peak at
B470 cm1 increased with the increased addition of Ba21 ions,
up to 3 wt%. For a Raman mode, FWHM is inversely corre-
lated to the lifetime of the phonon and a narrower peak corre-

of Ba(CexZr1x)O3 results in deterioration of BET speciﬁc sur-
face areas when Ba21 ion addition is over 5 wt%.
(3) Crystallite Size of CZ
Figure 8 shows bright-ﬁeld TEM images of CZa and the BCZa
series samples. Severe agglomeration was observed in the CZa
images (Fig. 8(a)). The agglomeration extent was lessened by
adding small amounts (0.5–5 wt%) of Ba21 ions (Figs. 8(b–e)).
However, agglomeration increased as the amount of added
Ba21 ions increased to 10 wt% and over (Figs. 8(f, g)). The
BET results and TEM images reveal that the dispersion property
of CZ can be improved by adding a small amount of Ba21 ions
(o5 wt%), but deteriorates as the amount of Ba21 addition in-
creases (  10 wt%).
Figure 9 shows CZ crystallite size variation in CZa and the
BCZa series calcined at 10001C for 2 h. The minimum average
CZ crystallite sizes calculated from BET and TEM images were
in the 1BCZa (34.3 nm) and 3BCZa (23.9 nm) samples, respec-
tively. The CZ crystallite sizes, calculated from BET and TEM
images, following the addition of Ba21 ions initially exhibited
similar downward trends. The CZ crystallite size calculated from
XRD for CZa was smaller than the sizes of the 0.5BCZa
and 1BCZa samples in the XRD results. This smaller size is at-
tributed to phase separation in CZa, leading to XRD peak
broadening.

where DBET is the BET diameter (nm) and DXRD is the CZ
crystallite size (nm) measured from XRD peak of CZ using the
Scherrer equation.5 A high AN value indicates high particle ag-
glomeration.
Figure 10 shows the AN variation in CZa following the ad-
dition of Ba21 ions. The AN trend matches the agglomeration
changes in the TEM images (Fig. 8). Within the BCZa series, the
1BCZa and 3BCZa samples produced the lowest of the AN
values indicating that the greatest particle dispersion occurred in
those two samples.

Mamontov et al.34 and Fan et al.,13 who suggested that there are
certain kinds of active oxygen species located at the SrZrO3/
CeO2–ZrO2 interface that can improve the OSC of CZ.
The Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 mixed oxide is thermodynamically unstable
due to the interaction between positive Ce and Zr ions induced
by positive activity deviations that were derived by Janvier et al.1
using a thermodynamic model. Thus, CZ can decompose into
Ce and Zr rich, especially after high-temperature thermal treat-
ment,35,36 which deteriorates the OSC of CZ.12,33 In this study,
the effects of added Ba21 ions to CZ can be visualized by di-
viding the effects into three parts. First, for CZ without the
addition of Ba21 ions (Fig. 13(a)), there is severe particle-
agglomeration-induced CZ crystallite growth accompanied by
a decrease in the speciﬁc surface area after high-temperature
calcination. Second, Fig. 13(b) shows the effects produced
following the addition of 0.5–5 wt% Ba21 ions to CZ, which
results in higher OSC, better dispersion of CZ particles, and
higher speciﬁc surface areas due to restriction in the coalescence
of two adjacent CZ particles. This restriction resulted from
the presence of nanosized second phase BaZrO3 particles on
the surface of the CZ particles. In samples with o3 wt% Ba21
ion addition, CZ phase separation was inhibited, which resulted
in lower CZ lattice parameters than that in CZa. However, as
Ba21 ion addition increased over 3 wt%, Zr41 ions segregated
onto the surface of the CZ particles28,37,38 and reacted with the
Ba21 ions to form the second phase (BaZrO3). The maximum
OSC, which appeared after 5 wt%Ba21 ion addition, was due to
the high abundance of active oxygen species on the interface
between CZ and BaZrO3. Finally, with the addition of Ba
21
ions was  10 wt% (Fig. 13(c)) all microstructure feature pa-
rameters became worse, including the speciﬁc surface area and
particle agglomeration. In addition, as a result of the presence of
excess Ba21 ions, another second phase, Ba(CexZr1x)O3, was
observed. Thus, the OSC degraded substantially.
V. Conclusions
The addition of an appropriate amount of Ba21 ions (0.5–5
wt%) into Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 by impregnation was effective in retard-
ing phase separation, increasing the speciﬁc surface area of CZ,
providing active oxygen species at particle interfaces during
high-temperature calcination, and producing higher OSC. For
the samples with 43 wt% Ba21 ions added, a second phase
(BaZrO3) occurred as a result of the segregation of Zr
41 ions
onto the CZ particle surfaces and reaction with the Ba21 ions.
However, with the addition of Ba21 ions was  10 wt%, the
excess Ba21 ions reacted with CZ to form another second phase
(Ba(CexZr1x)O3), which resulted in increased particle agglom-
eration and decreased OSC. The maximum OSC (91.4 mmol/g)
was obtained following the addition of 5 wt% Ba21 ions, and
was due to the high abundance of active oxygen species on the
interface between CZ and BaZrO3.

技術說明
(中文) Ce0.5Zr0.5O2觸媒粉末因其具有優異之儲氧性質(Oxygen storage capacity, 
OSC)，在汽車觸媒轉換器中扮演相當重要的角色。但Ce0.5Zr0.5O2在高溫經過長
時間的持溫後會產生相分離的現象，形成富Ce相和富Zr相，而使儲氧性質劣化。
本研究以化學共沉法製備Ce0.5Zr0.5O2膠體粉末，經過700 ℃的煅燒，持溫2小
時，得到Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的奈米觸媒粉末，再以含浸法加入不同添加量鋇離子後，
以1000 ℃持溫2小時做熱處理，觀察添加鋇對於Ce0.5Zr0.5O2相分離的影響。由
XRD圖譜發現，添加鋇到Ce0.5Zr0.5O2之後，Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的富鋯相變少，而且
鋇會和Ce0.5Zr0.5O2中的Zr產生BaZrO3二次相，當BaZrO3產生後，粉末的比表面
積上升，同時粒徑大幅變小，顯示BaZrO3能夠阻礙Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的凝聚成長，也
抑制Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的相分離，但是添加過多的鋇，反而造成粉末的凝聚，使比表
面積下降。OSC的結果顯示，添加微量的鋇有助於改善Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的儲氧能力，
且鋇添加量為5wt%時，Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的儲氧能力最大。
(英文) Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 powders play an important role in three-way catalysts for its outstanding 
oxygen storage capacity. However, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phase would separate into Ce-rich 
phase and Zr-rich phase after high temperature calcinations, which result in the 
degradation of OSC properties. In this study, the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 gels were synthesized by 
the co-precipitation method, and calcined at 700  for 2 h to obtain the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2℃  
powders. Then, different amounts of Ba2+ ions were introduced into Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 
powders using impregnation method and subsequently calcined at 1000  for 2 h to℃  
obtain BCZ series powders. The effects of Ba2+ ions on the phase development, texture 
and oxygen storage capacity of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 were investigated. The XRD pattern 
indicated that Ba2+ ions would react with ZrO2 to form BaZrO3 and the XRD peak 
intensity of Zr-rich phase which occurred due to the phase separation of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 
phase decreased after adding Ba2+ ions into Ce0.5Zr0.5O2.
