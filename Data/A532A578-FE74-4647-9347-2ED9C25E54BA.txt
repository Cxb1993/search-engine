variation of polymer-structure would influence gas permeability and permselectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of poly(amide-imide)s
Poly(amide-imide)s were prepared by the direct polycondensation
polymerization of the diimide-dicarboxylic acid,
2,2-bis[N-(4-carboxyphenyl)-phthalimidyl]hexafluoropropane (6FDIA), and various
diamines. The route illustrated in Figure 1. The inherent viscosities of
poly(amide-imide)s were in the range of 0.93 to 1.43 dL/g. The reaction pairs of
poly(amide-imide)s were showed in Table 1.
2.2 Characterization of poly(amide-imide)s
The polya(amide-imide)s were characterized by DSC, Wide-angle X-ray
diffraction (WAXD) and DMA. The density of the membrane was measured with a
pycnometer (Accupyc-1330). From the weight in air and the volume, the density of
the polymer membrane was calculated. The density was used to calculate the fraction
free volume (FFV) from the following equation:
V
VV
FFV 0
 (1)
where V is the specific volume and V0 is the occupied volume of the polymer. The
occupied volume was calculated from the van der Walls volume, VW, by the Bondi’s
group contribution method.
V0=1.3 VW (2)
A related measure of chain packing, the polymer chain-packing density of each
polymer (PD), was calculated using the following relation [22]:

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Polymer characterization
The results of polymer physical properties in the three polymers are listed in
Table 2. The glassy transition temperatures Tg of all poly(amide-imide)s were higher
than 230 oC measured by DSC, or those were higher than 300 oC measured by DMA.
The restricted torsional of phenyl rings around a -C(CF3)2- linkage caused the higher
Tg for 6FDIA. Thus, it was exhibited all poly(amide-imide)s had good thermal
stability. The inherent viscosities of poly(amide-imide)s were in the range of 0.93 to
1.43 dL/g. That was revealed that all poly(amide-imide)s had excellent flexibility
after preparing membranes. As shown in Table 2, the order of the FFV values,
6F-TBAPS＞6F-DBAPB＞6F-BAPB, agreed with the one of the PD and density
values, 6F-TBAPS＜6F-DBAPB＜6F-BAPB. The poly(amide-imide) prepared from
TBAPS had highest value of FFV. Both reduced molecular interaction and a steric
effect induced symmetrically by bulky pendent groups, CH3, onto the phenyl rings of
the diamine TBAPS moiety at the sites ortho to the ether linkages to form the bulky
linkage tetramethylbisphenylsulfone appear to disturb efficient packing of polymer
chains. The poly(amide-imide) from BAPB had lower value of FFV than that from
DBAPB containing the bulky linkage dimethylbiphenyl formed by induced the methyl
groups onto the phenyl rings at the sites meta to the ether linkages. It is considered
that the larger degree of intermolecular interaction for BAPB permits more efficient
packing of the polymer chain in forming membrane. The FFV of poly(amide-imide)s
solubility increased slightly with increasing free volume. Consequently, the above
results clearly indicate that the diffusivity of the membrane is almost mainly
responsible for the transport of gas molecules, the solubility only little affects gas
permeation properties.
3.6 O2/N2 Separation Performance
It was interesting to compare the gas separation performance of the
poly(amide-imide) membranes in this study with other poly(amide-imide)s in the
literature and the data are listed in Figure 4. The solid line in Figure 4 is the trade-off
line for the O2/N2 separation performance observed for various glassy polymeric
membranes. As shown in Figure 4, the poly(amide-imide) membranes plots in this
study are not very close to the “upper bound” line indicating the moderate separation
performance among the poly(amide-imide) membranes developed so far. Anyway,
6F-TBAPS has the best O2/N2 separation performance among the poly(amide-imide)
membranes in this study.
4. Conclusions
Both the permeability and permselectivity of the 6F-TBAPS membrane is higher
than that of the 6F-DBAPB and 6F-BAPB membranes. In addition, the gas
permeability had good correlation with the FFV and γ-transition temperature. The
sorption behavior of aromatic poly(amide-imide) membranes can be well explained
by the dual mode sorption model. The Langmuir capacity constant and Henry’s law 
constant increase with FFV increasing. The 6F-TBAPS poly(amide-imide) membrane
containing the bulky group, hexafluoroisopropylidene linkage in the
diimide-dicarboxylic acid moiety and the the symmetrical tetramethyl substituents on
the phenyl rings of the diamine moiety, causing the highest gas permeability,
permselectivity, FFV and the lowest γ-transition temperature. According to
incorporating bulky pendent group into polymer backbone which enhance the O2/N2
separation performance, thus poly(amide-imide)s can be used as gas separation
membrane materials for oxygen and nitrogen separation.
