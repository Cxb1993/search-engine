Abstract: 
Electron beam (e-beam) lithography is a candidate for the next generation technology. 
Low dose e-beams lead to large LWR/LER. In-line inspection of line width roughness 
(LWR) and line edge roughness (LER) is important for semiconductor fabrication 
process. Here, a rapid optical LWR/LER metrology using 13.5 nm wavelength are 
proposed. The samples are periodically modulated line-space PMMA patterns on 
silicon substrate. The influence of roughness to reflectivity at 80° incidence is 
numerically investigated by RCWA method. The reflectivity of p-polarization with 
90° azimuth angle has highest sensitivity to roughness among all incident 
configurations. For inspecting roughness of some frequencies, assistance of other 
incident configurations is needed. In addition, (0,1) order diffraction can be used to 
detect low frequency, opposite phase modulation type roughness. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
As the critical dimension (CD) of transistors shrinks down, the effects of line width 
roughness (LWR) and line edge roughness (LER) are becoming apparent in device 
performance [1]. Lithography process control for resist LWR/LER is an important 
issue. Electron beam (e-beam) lithography is a candidate for the next generation 
technology [1, 2]. One single electron may carry energy of several to one hundred eV, 
thus high dose e-beams result in heat load problem. Moreover, low dose e-beams lead 
to large LWR/LER. Another candidate for sub 22 nm nodes is extreme ultraviolet 
(EUV) lithography using a wavelength of 13.5 nm [1, 3]. Because of the massive loss 
of projection system and lack of high source power, using high resist sensitivity for a 
reasonable throughput is desired in EUV lithography. However, high resist sensitivity 
leads to high LWR/LER. LWR/LER in e-beam lithography and EUV would be more 
serious than 193 nm, in-line metrology for LWR/LER is important in fabrication 
process. 
 
LWR/LER metrology is demanded for lithography process control. Standard 
metrology tools for LWR/LER are the CD scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) 
and the CD atomic force microscopy (CD-AFM) [4]. But it takes time for CD-SEM 
and CD-AFM to scan a photo and analyzing the LWR/LER. There is a demand of fast 
inspection for multi points in one wafer and for large amount of wafers. We propose a 
rapid optical metrology method using EUV wavelength. LWR/LER can be detected 
by measuring the variation of 0th order reflectivity. In addition, appearance of (0,1) 
order diffraction for incidence with 0° azimuth indicates the existence of low spatial 
frequency LWR. 
 
complex. The reflectivity of IPM pattern with 352 nm periodicity has deceasing trend 
which is opposite with the trend of other patterns. There are totally different trends 
depending on modulation periodicity. A further investigation for different 
periodicities is illustrated below. 
 
Fig. 3 0th order reflectivity variation versus periodicity. The variation is calculated 
from the average of OPM and IPM reflectivity. The modulation amplitude is fixed to 
4.4 nm, which is 20% of line width. Modulation periodicities are from 11 nm to 352 
nm. 
 
In Fig. 3, the modulation amplitude is fixed to 4.4 nm. The reflectivity variation is 
calculated as (I-I0)/I0. I is the average reflectivity of OPM and IPM patterns. Because 
real roughness of two edges is random, reflectivity is likely the average of two type 
modulations. I0 is the reflectivity of line pattern without roughness. “p” and “s” in 
legend represent p- and s-polarization respectively, their polarization directions are 
perpendicular to each other. For 0° azimuth, variation is more sensitive to 
periodicities longer than 88 nm. There are decreases of reflectivity about 7% in both 
polarization states. For 90° azimuth, p-polarization obtains larger increase about 8-
17% in most of the periodicity range. But there are two blind periodicities around 22 
nm and 352 nm. In those periodicities, the variation is non-sensitive or in opposite 
trend, s-polarization in 90° azimuth and both polarizations in 90° azimuth can 
complement the detection in those special frequencies. 
 
 
Fig. 4 (a) (0,1) order reflectivity versus amplitude. Incident wave is p-polarized at 0° 
azimuth. Modulation periodicity is 352 nm. (b) (0,1) order reflectivity versus 
periodicity. Incident wave is at 0° azimuth. The pattern is OPM with amplitude 4.4 
nm. Reflectivity only appears for lower special frequency roughness.

Keywords:  EUV interferometric lithography, Diffraction grating, Nanoimprint 
 
Extreme ultraviolet interferometric lithography (EUVIL) provides a simple way to expose one-dimensional 
(1D) and two-dimensional (2D) periodic patterns, especially for sub-100-nm linewidths. Because of the 
limited coherence in EUV sources, an achromatic interferometric configuration [1-2] is commonly 
employed without using complicated optics. The exposure platform has been set up at the undulator 
beamline 21B2 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), as shown in Fig. 1(a). 
The scheme of the achromatic setup is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). A transmission grating is used as a beam 
splitter. The 0th order beam is blocked, and the 1st order diffracted beams from the transmission grating 
interfere to form an interference fringe. The pitch of the resulting fringe is half the pitch of the transmission 
gratings and is independent of the illuminating wavelength. 
 
The transmission grating is the most important component in EUVIL. Fig. 2 shows the fabrication 
procedure of the transmission diffraction grating with original and our proposed approach. The substrate is 
the silicon wafer. First, silicon nitride (Si3N4) films with thicknesses of 100 nm are coated on both sides of 
the silicon wafer. The top Si3N4 film is used as a membrane to support the chromium (Cr) grating. The 
bottom Si3N4 film is used as a hard mask when performing the silicon backside etching. The grating pattern 
is defined by electron-beam lithography. The fabrication process is time-consuming in this step owing to 
the intrinsic sequential patterning characteristic of the electron-beam lithography. After the resist 
development, a lift-off process is utilized to obtain the Cr grating. The lift-off process is difficult to control 
especially for lift-off nanostructures. 
 
We proposed the fabrication of the EUV transmission grating by nanoimprinting the SU-8 resist film. 
Compared to the electron-beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography has the advantages of being low cost 
and high throughput. The bilayer grating is then obtained by evaporating Cr on the imprinted SU-8. Fig. 3 
shows the SEM images of imprinted SU-8 grating before and after Cr deposition. The grating half-pitch 
was 150 nm and the height of SU-8 was approximately 300 nm. The thickness of the top Cr grating was 
around 35 nm and the thickness of the bottom Cr grating was smaller than that of the top grating. The 
optical behavior of the bilayer grating was evaluated by rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). Fig. 4 
shows the transmitted 1st diffraction efficiencies of the bilayer EUV transmission grating as a function of 
the grating half-pitch. The 1st diffraction efficiency is getting higher with respect to a smaller grating pitch. 
 
In summary, simple two-step processes were proposed to fabricate the EUV transmission grating. The 
bilayer Cr grating is obtained by nanoimprinting the grating structure on the SU-8 resist film and a 
subsequent Cr evaporation. No additional lift-off step is required in this process.
