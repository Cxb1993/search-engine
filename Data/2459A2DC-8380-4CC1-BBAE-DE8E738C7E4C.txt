Electronic-controlled route to chaos in a
quantum-well laser diode is carried out by a
delayed-feedback technique. By introducing
an extra delayed-feedback control term
$cS_{n}(t-\tau)$, chaotic light output can be
achieved. Bifurcation diagram suggests
quasi-periodicity route to chaos. In
addition, a practical algorithm to calculate
the Lyapunov exponents for delay differential
equationshas been developed. The preliminary
experiments results also indicates chaotic
behaviors.
二、報告內容
Dynamical chaos in laser diodes has become an
interesting communication [1,2]. Chaotic
light output from a laser diode can be achieved
by optical- or electronic-controlled
techniques. Optical-controlled technique
includes optical feedback using an external
cavity [3] or by an optical injection from a
second laser diode [4].
Electronic-controlled technique is carried
out by injecting a sinusoidal and a bias
current into the laser diode $I = a + b
\sin{2\pi f_{o}t}$, where $a$ is the bias
current, $b$ is the modulation current,
$f_{o}$ is the external modulation frequency
[5,6]. In general, high bias and strong
current modulation, or two tone modulation are
required to achieve chaos.
Electronic-controlled route to chaos in a
laser diode can be further expanded using a
delayed-feedback technique. This delay
technique has also been used to
optical-controlled route to chaos in a laser
diode [7]. Hopf bifurcation subject to a
large delay is also verified [8]. In this work,
the electronic delayed-feedback technique is
applied to a quantum well laser diode. A PIN
photo detector can be placed at the other side
of the facet of the laser diode, as the case
of most commercial laser diodes. The
photocurrent is proportional to the output
photon density $S_{n}(t)$. Since the chaotic
output is always a broadband signal, the
bandwidth of the photo detector should be high
enough to ensure the coverage of the chaotic
spectra. An electronic delayed-feedback loop
is then established by leading the
photocurrent to a delayed-time circuit and a
gain stage, and then mixing with the sinusoidal
input. The overall current is then injected
into the laser diode and is given by $$I = a
+ b \sin{2\pi f_{o}t}+ c S_{n}(t-\tau),
\eqno(1)$$, where $c$ is the current gain, and
$\tau$ is the loop delay time. With the
introduction of the extra delay term
$cS_{n}(t-\tau)$, it is shown that the chaotic
light output can obtained at relatively low
bias and small modulation depth. Note that
without modulation and delay, the system
always converges to a fixed point. With delay
only or small modulation depth only, it is not
possible to achieve chaos. The interaction
between modulation and delay forms a quasi-2
period route to chaos. These chaotic
behaviors are further investigated by
bifurcation diagram, Poincar\'e map, and
Lyapunov exponent.
3self-pulsating frequency $f_{0}$ increases
due to the increase in bias current a. When a
= 30 mA is injected, the corresponding $f_{0}$
is 2.28 GHz. This value is used in the
calculations throughout.
By injecting $N$ sinusoidal subcarriers
into a self-pulsating laser diode ($I =
a+\sum_{i} b_{i} \sin{2\pi f_{i} t}$), optical
chaotic light can be obtained. In order to
characterize the asymptotic behavior of the
drive system, numerical computations on
Poincare maps, and Lyapunov exponents are
carried out for $N$ = 4.
In the three-dimensional phase diagram
($N_{1}$, $N_{2}$, and $S$) of the rate
equations, let $\Sigma$ be a two-dimensional
hyperplane through a point (0, 0.298, 0) with
normal direction [0,1, 0]. The Poincare maps
are taken from $\Sigma$. Figure 2 shows the
bifurcation diagram of the Poincare map with
$S(t)$ versus $b = \sum_{i} b_{i}$ for $f_{i}$
= 0.1 $f_{0}$, 0.2 $f_{0}$, 0.3 $f_{0}$, and
0.4 $f_{0}$. It is important to note that the
four subcarrier frequencies must be chosen in
a fractional ratio such that the
quasi-2-period route to chaos can be
maintained. When $b \in (0, 2.2)$ the system
has a quasi 2-period attractor. The system
has a periodical window at $b \in (2.2, 6.2)$
and period-doubling occurs when $b > 6.2$.
The phenomenon of the period-doubling routes
to chaos occurs when $b \sim 6.5$.
According to Pecora and Carroll's theory,
synchronization can only be achieved for all
negative CLEs. The CLEs are found by
calculating the Lyapunov exponents for the
entire system and comparing these to the
Lyapunov exponents of the drive system. If all
the CLEs are negative $\lim\limits_{t
\rightarrow \infty} E(t) = 0$, the two systems
will be synchronized. If there is a positive
CLE, the difference system will grow further
apart as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Thus, by using
a positive CLE, synchronization can be
established between the drive and response
system under chaotic multi-tone modulation.
AM signals are added to each subcarrier
and the resulting injection current is $I =
a+\sum_{i} (b_{i} + \Delta b \sin{2\pi \Delta
ft})\sin{2\pi f_{i}t}$, where $\Delta f$ is
the AM signal frequency, and $\Delta b$ is the
AM signal amplitude. In the response system,
$\hat{b}_{i}$ remains a constant current. Thus,
the two chaotic systems are no longer identical.
If $\Delta b$ is small, the two chaotic systems
become asymptotically synchronized. The
synchronized error function $E_{S}(t)$ can be
described by [8]
where $k$ is the proportional constant and
$\epsilon$, the difference term between the
drive and response systems, which is given by
Figure 3 shows the first Lyapunov exponent
$\gamma_{1}$ of the synchronized error
function versus $\hat{\delta}$ for $\delta =
0$, $N$ = 4, b = 9 mA, and a = 30 mA. The positive
first Lyapunov exponent implies the chaotic
behaviors of the synchronized error function.
Fig.~3 shows the frequency spectrum of the
synchronization error function, which has a
complex and unpredictable pattern. The signal
frequency $\Delta f$ is well hidden by the
chaotic modulation. Thus, the purposes of the
private communication can be achieved.
The introduction of a linear LPF to the
original differential model can be described
by [9] $$\eqalignno{& \dot{X}(t) = -\eta X(t)
+E_{S}(t), &(7) } $$ where $X(t)$ is the output
of the filter and $\eta$ is the cutoff
frequency. Figure 5 plots the Poincare cross
section of the $X(t)$ vs $X(t-\tau)$ against
the cutoff frequency $\eta$ for $\hat{\delta}
= 200$, $\delta = 0$, $N$ = 4 , b = 9 mA, and
a = 30 mA, where $\tau$ is a delay time chosen
to be $(10 f_{0})^{-1}$. Note that for
$\hat{\delta} = 200$, the first Lyapunov
exponent of the synchronized error function is
1.3 GHz from Fig.~3. For a large cutoff
frequency, contribution of the differential
term can be ignored ($E_{S}(t) \sim \ X(t)$).
Thus, the Poincare cross section ($\eta >$ 3
GHz) shows a continuous dense attractor- a
typical behavior of a chaotic waveform. For a
very small cutoff frequency, $E_{S}(t) \sim
\dot{X}(t)$. The Poincare cross section ($\eta
< $ 0.2 GHz) shows a broken attractor- an
integration effect of the dense attractor.
However, when the cutoff frequency matches the
first Lyapunov exponent of the synchronized
error function ($\eta \sim$ 1.3 GHz), as
suggested in Ref.~[9], an increase in fractal
