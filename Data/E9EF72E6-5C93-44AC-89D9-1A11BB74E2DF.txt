Abstract
Magnolol was a pure compound extracted from Magnolia Officinalis. It has
been postulated to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, a major risk factor for
restenosis caused by PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). The
specific aim of the study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of Magnolol that was
encapsuled by liposome on smooth muscle cell proliferation via MTT
(3-(4,5dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dip-he-nyltetrazolium bromide) assay. With the
In this study, magnolnol was capsulated by liposome. With MTT assay
measurement, the experiment result was compared with the one of uncapsulated
magnolnol. The drug efficiency of liposome-capsulated magnolnol would be concerned.
Materials and methods
1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) ( > 99% pure),
1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine from egg yolk(EPC) ( ~ 99% pure) were
purchased from Sigma Chemical Company[13], USA and were used as received.
Ethanol ( ~ 99.5% pure) was supplied by Seoul Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Korea and
HPLC grade hexane ( > 99% pure) was obtained from Ferak Laborat GmbH, Germany.
All the mixtures with desired proportions were prepared by dissolving appropriate
weights of materials in an ethanol/hexane (1：9, v/v) solution and were stored at 4 ℃.
The water used in all experiments was prepared by using a Milli-Q plus water
purification system and its resistivity was 18.2 M-cm. Before used, all glassware in
contact with the samples was exhaustively rinsed with purified water.
Magnolol was a pure compound isolated from Magnolia Officinalis [14]with
quantification by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). We have used
two different phospholipids, EPC and DPPC, to construct liposome. Magnolol and
phospholipids were mixed by ultrasonic facilitation (DC-150H, Delta®, Taiwan) to
form the nano-scale liposome containing Magnolol.
After 1 day of drug treatment, 10μl of MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethyl
thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) having concentration of 5 mg ml−1 in
PBS was added to each well and left to further incubation for 4 hour at 37 °C. After this
especially EPC liposome. Liposome sample was sent to Center of Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology in National Chung Hsing University and inspected by Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Co.Ltd, Japan).
In Figure 2, the size of pure EPC liposome in this experiment was under 50
nanometers in average, and the complete lipid bi-layered structure was showed clearly.
With the arrow sign indicating, the diameter of liposome was near 20 nanometers. The
empty hydrophilic room was formed by the self-assembled EPC liposome. And the
Magnonol was supposed to be capsulated in this empty hydrophilic room.
Figure 3 was TEM picture of EPC liposome with magnolol. Comparing with
Figure 2, it showed while liposome was containing magnolnol, the size of liposome was
enlarged [20-22]. The darker color of the hydrophilic room suggested that there were
containee capsulated by the container, the liposome. The arrow sign indicated that
magnolnol was capsulated in the EPC liposome. The scale bar implied that the diameter
of capsulated liposome was from 50 to 100 nanometers.
According to the data of MTT assay, it suggested that EPC liposome was more
effective than DPPC liposome in preventing cell from proliferating.
Conclusions
By using different components of nano-scale liposome observed by TEM, we tried
to determine the drug delivery efficiency. Our current finding demonstrated that EPC in
inhibiting cell proliferation is more effective than DPPC, suggesting the selection of an
appropriate liposome carrier being critical for enhancing drug potency.

Our goal was to generate the extracellular domain of gamma-aminobutyric acid
type A receptor (GABAA receptor) by comparative modeling and to study the
interaction of zolpidem with the GABAA receptor. The modeling strategy was verified
to provide reasonable 3-dimensional coordinates. These coordinates helped to combine
all the subunits well. The benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site was located in a binding
pocket between the α1 and γ2 subunits of the GABAA receptor. Zolpidem was selected
to dock into the binding site. In our study, the residues of the binding pocket were
suggested to be αHis129, αTyr187, αGly228, αThr234, αTyr237, γMet96, γPhe116, 
γSer130, γGly143, and γMet169. By the calculation of docking module, the
conformation of zolpidem docking in BZ binding site was investigated. A hydrogen
bond had found atγArg136 when zolpidem’s conformation was in the rank 2 of docking
score. The contracted binding pocket showed the residues at αHis129, αTyr187, 
αGly228, αTyr237, γPhe116, and γMet169. Zolpidem docking in contracted binding
pocket might generate a hydrogen bond inαHis129.

INTRODUCTION
subunit.9-11 The GABAA receptor was isolated from adult human brain.12 BZω1binding
pocket is located between subunit α1 and subunit γ2.9,13 According to Sigel’s study, it 
suggests that the buried surface is about 1114 Å2.14 Since membrane proteins are not
easily crystallized,15 no valid X-ray or NMR structure of the GABA receptor has been
obtained. Therefore, comparative modeling was used to construct the protein
structure.16,17,18 Acetylcholine binding protein (AchBP, Protein Data Bank ID: 1I9B)
has been used as a template for performing comparative modeling of the pentameric
structure.5,19,20 This study aims to dock zolpidem into the BZω1 receptor and to
investigate the compound conformations.21 By the computer-aided processing, chemical
preferences shall be collected.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Molecular Simulation is performed under discovery studio modeling 1.5 (Accelrys,
San Diego, USA). The server hardware included Dual AMD opteron 250 (AMD, USA),
RAM 2GB (PC-3200, ECC registered), Nvidia GeForce Mx4000 (64MB DDR
memory).
Protein precursor sequences of subunit α1, β2, and γ2 are available from the
website of Swiss Prot. The signal peptides were removed from the downloaded protein
sequences.22 As the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites are extracellular, 9
intracellular sequences were removed from the downloaded sequences. The
extracellular domain sequence of subunit α1 is from residue 28 to residue 251. The
extracelular domain of β2 is from amino acid 25 to 244, and the γ2 extracelular 
GABAA receptor structure was modeled by the way of building all subunit
structures (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Every alignment of subunit sequence and template
sequence was adjusted manualy according to Chou’s alignment. The GABAA receptor
was composed of α1β2α1γ2β2 (counterclockwise). These alignments were combined
together into one alignment profile for protein structure model building. With the
protein structure was built, disulfide bonds were formed between Cys166 and Cys180 of
subunit α1, Cys160 and Cys174 of subunitβ2, and between Cys190 and Cys204 of 
subunitγ2.
Fig. 3 indicated the change of normal binding pocket and contracted binding
pocket. In this figure we found out even the bind pocket was contracted, the key
residues were still located in the contracted binding pocket. The BZ binding pocket was
located at the interface of subunitα1 and subunit γ2. There was a cavity found between 
the interface about 864.625 Å3 by the cavity finding algorithm. The Fig. 3(b) shows that
the binding site was contracted to 492.75 Å3.
The contraction of binding site was a necessary step before compound docking
was lunched. While the binding site was un-contracted, the cavity was as large as the
interface between two subunits. As performing docking process to the un-contracted site,
ligandfit would search a wider location for zolpidem to dock. The wider location would
uncertainly be the binding pocket as mentioned in various studies.9,13 ,30, 31 The residues
of the pocket were suggested to be αHis129, αTyr187, αGly228, αThr234, αTyr237, 
γMet96, γPhe116, γSer130, γGly143, and γMet169. Figure 4 shows zolpidem is docked
to the un-contracted site. The conformation of zolpidem docking in un-contracted site
ranked first at the docking score was showed in the Fig. 4(a), and ranked second in the
While the contracted binding site was still larger than the compound, it would be
divided into partitions. The more partitions it divided, the longer calculating time it
took.
Zolpidem was docked to the pocket as mentioned in various studies.
Hydrogen-bonding may generate between zolpidem and αHis129 (bond length: 2.13 Å).
The results were consistent with various studies. As several residues mentioned in
various studies were gathered around the binding sites, it was mediately inferenced that
the predicted protein structure and binding pocket were trustworthy.
