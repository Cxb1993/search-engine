Abstract 
 
Surgery simulation and automatic surgery 
management are the main medical applica-
tions in volume graphics. The neuromuscu-
loskeletal system includes bones, joints, the 
spine, the skull, the craniofacial bone, ears 
and the throat that are delicate, near the nerve 
or brain. Thus, burring operations in neuro-
musculoskeletal surgery are carefully im-
plemented to polish and carve an arbitrate 
shape of bone or to delete soft tissues such as 
disc space substances. In this project, we de-
velop the visual and haptic simulation func-
tions for burs of various shapes or types of 
flutes. Then, we develop an algorithm to 
recognize if a structure is separate during 
burring simulations. We last integrate the 
simulation functions of recognizing, reposi-
tioning and fusing separate structures with 
the burring simulation function to simulate 
various modalities in neuromusculoskeletal 
surgery.  
We also develop neuromusculoskeletal 
surgery planning methods by recognizing 
structures of the spine, joints, craniofacial 
bone, ear and nose bones, and deformity fea-
tures of spurs or tumors from the patient vo-
lume, and design the surgery to delete the 
deformities for achieving the surgery purpose. 
Moreover, to improve the effects of training 
residents and students, we also calculate the 
expected positions and volumes of structures, 
features and the nerve and brain and then 
compare in real-time with the ones obtained 
from every burring step to verify if the bur-
ring operation can be successful to obtain the 
expected structures and features and if the 
bur was near the dangerous areas, such as the 
nerve or brain.  
 
Keywords: volume graphics, haptic interac-
tion, burring surgery simulation, neuro-

二、前言 
計算機圖學在醫學臨床上的一個主要
應用:手術模擬可驗證或練習手術計畫及
用於訓練學生或臨床醫生。而觸感可提高
模擬系統的真實度可提高訓練效果。目前
提供觸感的手術模擬可分為兩類，一為軟
組織變形(如[Gibson 99] [Frank 01] [Frick 
01][Choi 03] [Chen 06][Basdogan 07])，另一
為硬組織(即骨頭)的去除([Hsieh 06] [Tsai 
07][Wang 05][Agus 03])。後者使用高速轉
動或擺動工具，如骨鑽(drill)骨鋸(saw)及骨
磨(bur)來去除骨頭，達到鑽洞(用 drill, bur)
切除出形狀(用 saw 或 bur)。bur 的用途很
廣，其去除量及抵抗力雖遠低骨鑽及骨
鋸，去除效率較不佳，但可用於骨頭鑽洞，
切出任意形狀及磨亮表面等多用途。此外
頭骨，脊椎，牙齒，耳鼻骨，關節等器官
組織精細，或者靠近神經、腦組織等重要
器官，也必須用骨磨小心切削。另外骨磨
也可用來切掉軟組織，如椎間盤、息肉等。
不似骨鑽及骨鋸只用來切削骨頭等硬組
織。 
bur 目前的模擬手法，依其原始資料有
很大的關係，如為掃瞄所得的表面資料，
通常在牙科的牙齒由於所得的多邊形模型
(polygon model)並無內部資料([Wang 05] 
[Thomas 01])，當要計算刀具有無切削物體
時，必須有刀具與表面模型的碰撞測試
(collision test)及穿過物體表面深度(depth)
的計算，以用於計算切削力等。用於形狀
簡單的牙齒或許可行，但用於形狀複雜的
一般器官，這些計算對於需要 haptic 
real-time(1000HZ)為一大挑戰。而如為斷層
掃瞄(tomogaphic slice, 如 CT:電腦斷層掃
瞄或 MRI:核磁共振造影)所得的容積資料

的骨刺為脊椎骨旁的小多餘結構，因為用
骨磨磨除，較不會傷害到正常脊椎結構；
又如脊椎骨間的脊椎盤也常有用骨磨磨除
的情況；也如中耳(鼓室)由三塊骨頭(聽小
骨)組成可能因發炎等而黏在ㄧ起，不能形
成共鳴相對位置，必須用骨磨做細磨分
開，或者切除鼻內息肉或清除外耳乳突
等。當然一個完整的手術術式，不只有骨
磨手術的步驟，往往包括其他步驟。例如，
手術時仍需高效率而利用骨鋸及骨鑽切
削，或者將所鋸開或磨開的獨立骨頭移除
或移至其他位置。另外骨頭間、或骨頭與
植骨、或與人工關節的融合等。雖然其他
骨磨的研究也開始探討與其他手術的整合
(如用平面橫貫整個容積以切開上下顎連
接處)[Morris 06]，但由於資料結構及配合
演算法的未完備，並未能提供其他手術步
驟的真實手術般的模擬。 
對於這些骨磨手術以外其他手術的模
擬，我們之前的國科會計畫成果，探討及
開發了骨骼肌肉系統(使用骨鋸及骨鑽)手
術及其他各項相關步驟的操作容積模擬方
法，包括了骨鋸掃開面的切割模擬，骨鑽
體積與骨頭的集合演算以模擬鑽骨，獨立
骨頭與人工關節零件移除、移動及融合模
擬，還有骨鋸及骨鑽切削時的觸覺反應模
擬等(如[Tsai 05][Hsieh 06][Tsai 07])。因此
本計畫“骨骼肌肉神經系統的容積形狀特
徵辨識，手術計術畫擬定及手術模擬即時
檢驗＂，開發骨骼肌肉神經系統手術用的
各式形狀與刀刃分布的骨磨切削模擬，並
整合之前所開發的骨鋸及骨鑽手術模擬的
資料結構及演算法，也完成獨立解剖結構
的操作，如獨立骨頭與人工關節零件移
除、移動及融合等模擬；以期能達成骨骼
肌肉神經系統各科別及各術式的手術模擬
功能的開發。 
本計畫也開發獨立解剖結構的辯識方
法，辨識出具有特定功能的解剖結構及其
中的形狀特徵以表現病症，而藉由去除病
症的步驟可建立得適切的手術計劃。而由
於骨骼肌肉神經系統手術往往牽涉到刀具
不可碰觸到的神經或腦組織等重要組織。
探討手術模擬時自動檢驗手術模擬成敗的
研究，使系統能隨時檢驗使用者在模擬骨
磨手術時，所欲切出的骨頭形狀是否有達
到預期，或刀具是否有過於接近神經等不
可碰觸之區域。也可檢討原先手術計畫的
效能，例如計劃是否能切削出適合骨頭形
狀，或讓人工關節契合，或檢出過於讓刀
具接近神經或腦組織等危險區域等的刀具
路徑。 
 
  
三、研究方法 
為達精細的骨骼肌肉神經之骨磨手術
模擬視覺及觸覺反應目的，本研究須發展
下列方法： 
1. 發展各種刀具形狀骨磨切削模擬。 
我們距離階化(distance-level)容積素，將
各種組織表面表現成容積主軸平行線上
的點，而於每一觸感位置利用每一條主
軸平行線與刀具的交點做比較即可知刀
具是否有切割到組織，以知是否要更新
容積素距離階值或將組織容積素改成空
氣，以模擬骨磨刀具的切削。我們之前
的計畫模擬球形骨磨刀具的切削[Tsai 
10]，然而實際骨骼肌肉神經系統手術中
骨磨刀具形狀多樣以適合不同的用途，
除球形外、尚有圓柱形(半徑可隨軸改
變)、圓錐形、橢圓球形、拋物球形等，
或是上述形狀混合。所以本計畫探討不
同形狀骨磨的每一觸感位置線與刀具的
交點以正確模擬切削的視覺及觸覺反
應。由於必須每一觸感位置(1000HZ)求
交點，刀具方程式不能複雜。我們利用
一系列線性轉換簡化刀具方程式使其不
含交叉積一次項以簡化方程式計算，達
到即時骨磨手術模擬的效果。

病症)，而藉由去除病症的步驟可建立得適
切的手術計劃 [Tsai 05][Tsai 07] 。本計畫
中為了即時手術模擬檢驗，我們距離階化
病症的形狀特徵，將各病症特徵表面表現
成容積主軸平行線上的點，而手術模擬時
利用每一觸感位置，刀具與每一條主軸平
行線的交點做比較即可知刀具是否有切割
到病症的形狀特徵以知是否有過切導致危
及神經或腦組織等解剖結構，或不足去除
病變的形狀特徵而導致手術失敗，以達自
動檢驗手術計畫的目的。也可檢討原先手
術計畫的效能，例如手術計劃是否能切削
出適合解剖結構形狀，或讓人工關節契合
等。 
 
5. 以 Phantom 力回饋裝置及北醫附醫

6. 配合台北醫學大學的實際臨床例測試

手術的骨骼肌肉系統之手術模擬已經在之
前計畫被探討( [Hsieh 02][Tsai 05][Tsai 
07a])，在此只討論包含骨磨手術為基礎的
骨骼肌肉神經系統模擬系統之手術模擬，
當然獨立骨頭與人工關節零件移除、移動
及融合等模擬也包括在內，以構成一個完
整術式的模擬。計劃共同主持人謝銘勳

Surgery simulators are considered as effective training and rehearsing tools because a single 
procedure or a whole modality on a virtual patient can be repeated without any extra cost through the 
simulators. Surgeons usually use tomographic images such as CT or MRI slices to evaluate the 
morphology of anatomic structures or to confirm positions and shapes of abnormal structures before 
implementing spine surgery [19–23]. These slices constitute a volume containing uniform cubic 
elements (voxels). Positions and interiors of the anatomic structures and tumors can be indicated by 
the voxels directly to simplify calculations for the penetration depth and collision detection of 
surgical tools with the structures. Over the past year, many simulators have been developed by 
manipulating volume data (such as for arthroscopic or oral implant or facial plastic surgery [24–26]).  
Successful implementation of spine surgery requires skills of critical cutting (burring and 
screwing) operations on vertebral bones and awareness of spine morphology changes caused by 
morphological operations on bone grafts or the vertebral bones [11–15, 27]. Therefore, a spine 
surgery simulator is requested to provide accurate and real-time cutting simulations by which if 
cutting surface features and haptic senses are satisfactory can be confirmed. The simulator is also 
requested to check if a separate structure is generated during the cutting simulations, than to 
implement morphological operations such as structure repositions, deletions and fusions on separate 
structure.  
This study proposes a volume manipulation method that can simulate cutting (burring and 
screwing) operations with various types of tools used in specific spine surgical procedures, detect 
separate bone structures generated in cutting, and simulate morphological operations on separate 
anatomic structures. This paper is structured into several parts. Section 2 introduces related works of 
volume based bone cutting and morphological simulation methods and describes their limitations in 
simulating spine surgery. Our reported volume manipulation and cutting force calculation methods 
that helps the makeup of the simulation method and system for spine surgery are also introduced. 
Section 3 introduces the architecture of our prototype system. Section 4 introduces the voxelization

method of detecting which parts of a tool contact (cut) tissue and summating tissue removal loads on 
the contacted parts can predict accurate directional cutting forces that can respond to complex bone 
geometry [30, 36]. Meanwhile, we also developed a method that checks if a new separate bone has 
been generated after intersections of saw-swept surfaces with a bone and implements various 
morphological simulations such as bone open, reposition, deletion and fusion, on the new bone by a 
fast seed flooding algorithm [37].  
The above simulation functions are insufficient to simulate spine surgery. First, current real-time 
simulations have been realized only for simple and symmetric spherical burs because ball equations 
remain unchanged even the haptic device position and axis changed [28–30]. For spherical burs, 
intersections of the tool with volume-axis-parallel lines can be simply calculated by shifting the 
intersections at the previous haptic step to the current step [30]. However, spine surgery requires 
various shapes such as cone, cylinder, disc and barrel of burs, and various types of flutes or coating 
on burs or screws for specific surgery procedures [9, 38]. The rotating tool-enveloped surface 
determines the cutting surface and the tool coating or flutes determine the haptic response. For 
example, a cylindrical tool can be a drill, screw, drum, or router.  A drill (or screw) with helix flutes 
and is used to drill a hole from a bone; meanwhile, a router (or drum) with straight flutes is used to 
channel a route (or reaming a hole on a bone). Therefore, this study first proposes a method to 
simulate cutting operations by various shapes and flutes of burs or screws used in spine surgery. 
Second, if a structure is separated during every cutting simulation step must be check to know if 
morphology operations such as repositioning a separate structure or fusing it with other structures can 
be implemented. Therefore, when a voxel has been nullified (all tissues removed from this voxel), 
our method manipulates voxel face data of the cutting structure to detect whether this structure can be 
separate.

reconstruction can be speeded up to be real-time with a help of a dynamical cube data structure [31].  
Then, the rendering process renders all tissue triangles. 
 When a voxel is nullified during cutting simulations, the separation recognition process uses 
voxel face-flags of the cutting structure to check if a new structure is generated. The morphological 
operation process can than implement morphological operations such as deletion or movement of a 
structure or fusion on structures of bone or bone graft can be implemented based on the manipulations 
by voxel face-flags of the structures.  
 
4.  Voxelization of cutting tools used in spine surgery 
Our method for voxelizing the tool bases on the tool coordinate system not the patient (i.e., volume) 
coordinate system. The origin and the axes of the tool coordinate system coincide with the haptic 
device position and axes (Fig. 2). Therefore, the tool surface equation can be unchanged even the 
haptic device position and axes are changing at every haptic step. The intersection computation for 
the tool surface equation with volume-axis-parallel lines based on the tool coordinate system is thus 
faster than based on the volume coordinate system because the tool surface equation requires no 
re-computation and includes no cross and first terms. However, the parametric representation of an 
volume-axis-parallel line becomes changing in every haptic step and is determined as follows,

(px, py, pz) indicates the haptic device point represented in the volume coordinate system.  The 
vector (vx, vy, vz) indicates the direction of the axis-parallel line in the tool coordinate system that are 
calculated from (1, 0, 0) or (0, 1, 0) or (0, 0, 1), the lines in the volume coordinate system with the 
following rotation transformations (Fig. 2),

5. Real-time cutting simulation by manipulations of voxel geometry and topology 
By manipulating voxel distance-levels with the intersections of the cutting tool with axis-parallel 
lines, tissue surface changes caused by cutting can be simulated. For example, an intersection (as a in 
Fig. 5(A)) becomes the new tissue vertex if located between the center of a tissue voxel and the tissue 
surface represented by the voxel distance-level. The voxel distance-level is renewed to represent this 
new tissue vertex. If the intersection (as b in Fig. 5(B)) is located between two tissue voxel centers (U 
and V), one voxel (U) is nullified. The face-flags of this voxel indicating the faces (l1, l2 and l3) 
neighboring other tissue voxels are therefore changed as boundary. Meanwhile, the original boundary 
face (l0) of this nullified voxel is no longer a boundary [30]. 
All boundary faces of a structure are connected together; however, it is time-consuming to check 
all boundary faces of a cutting structure. Our separation method therefore only checks if the new 
boundary faces generated from nullified voxels are connected. When a voxel is nullified, data about 
every new boundary face including the face (x, y, or z) type and the position are stored in a hash table 
and than an iterative process is implemented. First, some boundary face is taken out the hash table to 
store into another table. Other boundary faces in the hash table are check if sharing any of the four 
edges of this processed face. These edge-sharing boundary faces are also taken out the hash table to 
store into the new table to iterate the process. The iteration is finished until the original hash table is 
empty or no edge-sharing faces can be found for current processed boundary faces. The former 
indicates the cutting structure still cannot be separated; meanwhile, the latter indicates the structure is 
possible to be separate and the two hash tables record the boundary faces of the separate structures, 
respectively. 
As the simplified 2D example shown in Fig. 5, when the first nullified voxel U appears, the data 
about the new boundary faces l1, l2 and l3 are recorded in a hash table (Fig. 5(B)). The face types for l1 
and l3 are y, for l2 is x, respectively. The face positions are the center of U added by the vectors ((0, 0.5) 
or (-0.5, 0) or (0, -0.5), respectively) from the center to l1, l2 and l3. One boundary face (e.g., l1) is

A load on a cutting element is represented as four force components: tangential (Fh), radial (Fr), 
axial (Fa) and trust (Ft) components (Fig. 6). The tangential component is set against the rotation, the 
radial component toward this axis and the axial component along the tool axis. The trust component 
is against the tool moving direction. These force components are then transformed into Fx, Fy and Fz, 
the forces along the x-, y and z- axes of the tool and also the haptic device as the following equations, 
and then rendered to the haptic device. 
     ∑ ⋅−−= ))(sin(cos tHhrx FCFFF xfαα . 
      ∑ ⋅−+= ))(cos(sin tHhry FCFFF yfαα . 
∑ ⋅−= ))(( tVaz FCFF zf . 
f indicates the tool moving direction vector. x, y and z indicate the vectors along the x-, y- and z- 
axes. α indicates the angular position of the element relative to the x-axis and the trigonometric 
functions are also pre-computed to save computation time. CH and CV are the directional coefficients 
used to limit the tool moving direction. For some tools such as drills, screws (with helix flutes as 
shown in Fig. 6(B)) or drums (with straight flutes as shown in Fig. 6(C)) that can only cut bones along 
the tool axis, CH is therefore set a large value to prevent cutting sideways (perpendicular to the tool 
axis). For the tool such as routers (with straight flutes as shown in Fig. 6(C)), CV is large to prevent 
cutting along the tool axis. For most burs (as round bur with diamond coating shown in Fig. 6(A)), CH 
and CV are both near 1 to cut tissues freely along any direction. 
Meanwhile, the four force components are set as proportional to the tissue chip removal rate that 
equals to the product of the feed rate and the divided element area. The proportional coefficients 
actually depend on many variables such as the cutting velocity (a product of the rotational speed with 
the cross-section radius that the surface element located on), the feed rate, the flute or coating type 
and tissue types (cortical or cancellous bones). These coefficients were determined by the 
corresponding author who compared the virtual cutting forces by the haptic device and the real force 
by cutting frozen bones under the various variables as described above.

First, several holes was drilled on the C3 and C4 endplates to reveal the ranges of the discectomy and 
the osteotomy as illustrated in Fig 8(A)-(B). A 5mm round cutting bur was then used for gross cutting 
by a series of zigzag paths, meaning that the tool was cutting from the left end to the right end and 
from the right to the left end at the C3-4 disc space, alternately (Fig 8(B)-(C)). These paths delete out 
most of the C3-4 disc space substance and then cut about 3mm height of bones out from the C3 and 
C4 end plates, respectively (Fig 8(D)-(E)). Fig. 8(F) shows the gross cutting result in which the C3-4 
disc substance has almost been deleted and the C3 and C4 end plates have been cut. Then, a fluted 
corn was used for cutting the two sides of the C3-4 space as shown in Fig 8(F)-(H), because cone type 
burs easily curve out shapes of cylindrical bores.  Finally, a 3mm round polishing bur for fine cutting 
was used to remove disc space substance that is difficultly deleted by the large bur, and to make 
smooth and horizontal end plates as shown in Fig 8(I)-(L). The results of the polishing simulations 
demonstrate our system can delicately represent little changes on tissue surfaces by which smooth 
and horizontal surfaces of end plates for easily bone-grafting can be rehearsed through the simulator. 
The results of haptic responses about the hole drilling, rough cutting and polishing by round burs 
resembled the results reported in our previous results [30, 36]. The interval between sample points on 
the tool is sufficient to detect small amount of tissue cutting. Therefore, fine feeling about cutting 
forces under small burs and feeds, immersed depths or complex tissue geometry as the polishing 
operations on the C4 end plate. Fig. 9 demonstrates the simulations for bone-grafting in which a 
smooth cuboid graft bone has been inserted inside the C3-4 space. A surgeon can confirm if the size 
and position of the bone graft are comfortable by the assistance of the simulations.

L3 spinal processes (Figure 11(F)-(I)). Then, the repositioned L4 spinal process was repositioned 
back near the original position (Fig. 11(J)). Finally, 6 holes on the laminar and 6 holes on the spinal 
process were drilled respectively to wire fixing the spinal process with the laminar (Fig. 11(K)-(L)). 
The above simulations demonstrate the above spinal process reposition and deletion can achieve the 
spine decompression.  
Case 4: Morphology correction for lumber spine 
 The patient was a 39-year-old man and suffered from a falling-down from six-meter height. 
Physical examinations noted abdomen distension, numbness over both flank areas,  positive finding 
of low back pain on lateral bending of the both legs, hypoesthesia below the L2-distribution of both 
thigh, weak plantar flexion on  right big toe test, Laseque’s sign (positive finding with 35° elevation 
of the both lower legs), absence of ankle jerk and sensory loss in the L2 and L3 dermatome. These 
findings were indicative of spinal cord lesion below L2.  
CT (General Electric high speed CT/i) was performed in 48 transverse sections (256×256 
resolutions) from L3 to T11 with all 7 degrees oblique to the transversal plane and constant 3mm 
intervals. Fig. 12(A) shows a serious compression on L2, especially the anterior column that brought 
kyphosis. Fig. 12(B) also shows an un-symmetric horizontal compression on L2 that brought 
scoliosis. Fig. 12(C) shows four holes were drilled to indicate the screwing positions. Fig. 12(D) 
shows four posterior lateral pedicle screws were inserted and two fixation rods were positioned for 
fracture reduction and posterior fusion. 
 
8. Discussion 
Cutting on the critical spine is usually required in spine surgery. A surgery simulator with visuohaptic 
responses for cutting operations of various types of tools can provide an excellent platform for 
surgery rehearsing and training. Our system extended the method for spherical tools to the ones with 
any type of quadrics or compound quadrics, and associated any type of flutes and coatings to realize

manipulating real surgical cutting tools by controlling these coefficients. For example, both a drum 
and a router are cylinders with straight flutes. The former can be limited to ream a hole along the tool 
axis direction; meanwhile, the latter is along the axis perpendicular direction to carve a channel. 
However, the setting about the two directional coefficients does not base on any machining theorem.  
The values and the use about the directional coefficients should be further discussed.  In addition, soft 
tissues such as disc space substances or tumors are dealt as rigid bones that can be burred, 
repositioned and deleted. This approach may not precise but simple to achieve real-time responses. 
Although deformation computation for soft tissues is considered as complicated and time-consuming 
to be difficultly real-time [42–43], future work may include developing a method to simulate 
somewhat deformation but still be real-time for soft tissues. Future work should develop visuohaptic 
simulation techniques for some simple spine surgical procedures such as percutaneous vertebroplasty 
(PVP) [44–45]. PVP is a minimally invasive technique whereby osteoid cement is injected into a 
painful vertebral body for decompression. Although PVP does not open the spine and is simpler than 
the complex surgery as this study focused, the simulation for PVP can also help training and 
rehearsing about accurate injection positions and angles. 
 
Summary 
Training and rehearsing by VR simulations are important for critical spine surgery. In this study, we 
extended the previous work about real-time visuohaptic cutting simulations to be applied to the tools 
of various shapes and flute types. We also developed a method to check if a separate bone is generated 
during bone cutting. We then combined the functions for morphological operations such as reposition, 
deletion and fusion for bones and bone grafts in the system, so that a complex spinal surgery about 
spine decompression, abnormal tissue removal and spine morphology correction can be simulated.  
Three types of quadrics and the combinations of these quadrics can represent all tool surfaces 
used in various spine surgical modalities. Fast tool-tissue intersection computation can be achieved 
based on the tool coordinate system because the quadric equations can include no cross products and

Abstract 
This paper describes a virtual reality simulator for middle ear ossicle surgery. An automatic segmentation method has 
been developed to segment tiny ear ossicles at transverse computer tomography (CT) slices. Surgeons can therefore easily 
observe the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the segmented ossicles by the volume reconstruction and the spatial 
relation with the temporal bone to diagnose middle ear disease. Surgeons can use a virtual reality round cutting bur to cut 
the temporal bone for opening the 3D tympanic cavity, and a virtual reality round polishing bur to cut for separating ear 
ossicles from other bones or to polish the adhered tissue sclerosis on the ear ossicles. These burring simulations can achieve 
real-time visual and haptic responses based on our reported volume manipulation methods. A technique is developed to 
judge if a separation among the ossicles or from the temporal bone occurs during the burring simulations so that 
repositioning simulations can be followed to align the ear ossicles. A simulation example of a real ear ossicle surgery 
demonstrates these simulation functions work well even for tiny ossicles and thus shows the effectiveness of the surgical 
simulator to rehearse the surgical procedures, confirm surgical plans and train interns and students. 
 
Keywords: Middle ear surgery, Virtual reality surgery simulation, Ear ossicle, Volume visualization 
1. Introduction 
Surgeries for recovering functions of middle ear ossicles 
(malleus, incus and stapes) through bone ossicular replacements, 
alignment or cleaning are advanced surgical procedures for 
treating conductive hearing loss. However, the tiny sizes of these 
ossicles bring high surgical failure rates [1-5]. The X-ray based 
cephalogram is a standard procedure to evaluate geometry of the 
middle ear (tympanic) cavity and the inside ear ossicles, diagnose 
diseases and manage surgery. However, projection errors occur 
in using X-rays [6], which cannot provide correct spatial relations 
among the ear ossicles and with the temporal bone to make 
correct surgical plans. Meanwhile, computer tomography (CT) 
slices can provide interior information and avoid projection 
errors, and thus are considered as an excellent way to evaluate 
the tiny ear ossicles [7-10]. Three-dimensional (3D) 
reconstruction from a volume constituted by CT slices can be 
used to visualize pathologies of the ear ossicles [11] or simulate 
cutting operations on the 3D temporal bone [12,13].  
However, the ear ossicles are too small to be distinguished

from the neighboring temporal bone for visualization and then 
surgical simulation. This paper therefore proposes an automatic 
segmentation method to recognize the ear ossicles in the 
tympanic cavity on transverse CT slices. Using segmented 
ossicular areas on the two-dimensional (2D) CT slices, 3D ear 
ossicles can be highlighted from the temporal bone during the 
volume reconstruction. A surgeon can then easily zoom in on 
the tympanic cavity to simulate opening the tympanic cavity, 
polishing out tissue sclerosis on the ear ossicles and 
repositioning to align these ossicles. This paper also develops a 
volume-based simulation method that uses real-time visual and 
haptic burring simulation functions to open the tympanic cavity 
and polish the ear ossicles, checks whether the ossicles are 
separate or separated from the temporal bone and uses 
repositioning functions to align ossicles. In this preliminary 
study, we evaluated the usefulness of our method and the 
prototype system with a middle ear disease case. 
2. Subjects and methods 
2.1 Middle ear ossicle segmentation on transverse CT slices 
The process of finding the middle ear ossicles on a 
transverse slice is described as follows. 
 
Ear Ossicle Surgery Simulator 59 
voxel face is boundary (shared by two voxels of different 
tissues) and thus the associated distance-level represents a 
surface vertex between the two voxels. Therefore, six 
distance-levels represent 6 possible tissue vertices along the 
three volume-axis-parallel lines passing through the voxel 
center. Our previous work manipulated the voxel 
distance-levels to represent burred tissue changes on the 
volume-axis-parallel lines and thus to simulate burring 
operations with visual and haptic responses [15].  
Then, whether a burred ossicle is separated from other 
ossicles or the temporal bone by the burring simulations is 
calculated as follows. Figure 3 indicates the changes of the 
voxel faces during the burring simulations. The burs used in 
the ear ossicle surgery are near or smaller than the voxel 
width. The system checks whether a bone voxel center is 
overlapped by the cutting tool. If it is, this voxel is nullified 
(the voxel tissue type is set as air) and the face-flags indicate 
the faces between this voxel with the neighboring bone voxels 
are changed to indicate these face are boundary, as illustrated 
in Fig. 3(B). The burred ossicle is separated from other 
ossicles or the temporal bone if the bur traverses from 
immersing into bone voxels and then leaving into a null voxel 
(as V in Fig. 3(C)). Then, a seed is assigned to each side of 
the last voxel (as W). The separate ossicles can be then 
manipulated (deleted or repositioned) independently by the 
two seeds (S1 and S2). 
This simulator can manipulate (delete or reposition) a 
separate bone through a fast 3D seed and flood algorithm [14]. 
A deletion function traverses to nullify all voxels of the 
separate bone (set the tissue type of traversed voxels as null). 
Meanwhile, a reposition function traverses to store all voxels 
of the separate bone in a stack, deletes the bone and pops the 
stored data into the voxels of the new position in the reverse 
order as that in which they were stacked [16]. The system 
uses the marching cubes method to reconstruct triangulated 
bone surfaces [17]. However, the reconstruction for bone 
surfaces in a whole volume consumes time, making it difficult 
in real time. Therefore, the system uses a dynamical cube data 
structure to record reconstructed bone triangles inside every 
voxel. By manipulating the cube data structure, 3D 
reconstruction can be implemented not for the whole volume 
but only for the operated (burred) voxels to achieve real-time 
visual responses [18]. This 3D reconstruction method can 
reconstruct simultaneously surfaces of different tissues or 
structures (the temporal bone or ossicles) to assign these 
tissues or structures with different colors. Therefore, the 
recognized ossicles can be highlighted by being assigned a 
different color from other bones. 
3. Implementation 
Currently, our prototype system is implemented on a 
general PC with an IntelCore 2 Duo E8500 (3.16 GHZ) CPU, 3 
Gbytes of main memory and a NVIDIA GeForce9600 GT 
graphics card. The software uses the OpenGL libraries to 
render surfaces of bones through the volume visualization 
method, and uses the HDDIV libraries (by SensAble Inc.) to 
obtain 6D haptic device inputs and output 3D translational 
forces through the PHANToM Desktop (by SensAble Inc.) that 
is used to simulate a bur attached pen-like handpiece as 
illustrated in Fig. 4.

3.1 Case of a middle ear disease study 
A patient was a 39-year-old man suffering from a 
conductive hearing loss in the right ear. Frontal and lateral 
X-rays were performed and revealed a fixation between the 
tympanic cavity wall with the middle ear ossicles and tissue 
sclerosis on these ossicles. CT (spiral CT, GE LightSpeed) was 
performed in July, 2008 with 53 transverse slices at 1.25 mm 
intervals. These slices followed the DICOM protocol and were 
converted as raw data to constitute a volume (256  256  53 
intervals between slices and 0.625 mm pixel resolutions in the 
slices).   
Figure 5 shows the segmentation results for the ROI 
including the right ear on several successive transverse CT slices 
(in the gravity direction order). And shown in Figs. 5(A)-(D), 
some ranges of two separate cavities (A and B) were in the cavity 
range and thus were recognized as two independent cavities. 
Some ranges of one inside bone in the cavity A were in the inside 
bone range and thus were recognized as an inside bone. 
Meanwhile, no inside bones in B were recognized. In Figs. 5(E) 
and (G), one inside bone in the cavity A and two in B are 
recognized. In Fig. 5(F), one inside bone in the cavity A and one 
in B are recognized. In Fig. 5(H), the cavity A is not closed; 
therefore, is considered an open canal such as the auricular canal 
and the inside bone is thus not processed.

shows the posterior surface of the malleus being polished. 
Figure 7(G) shows the surfaces of the ossicles have been 
polished and was being repositioned. Figure 7(H) shows the 
ossicles was repositioned to suitable positions. The surfaces of 
the ossicles have become smooth after the polishing operations. 
The spatial relation between the ossicles and the tympanic 
cavity has become suitable. The above 3D images show our 
system can give virtual-reality burring simulations for tympanic 
cavity opening, bone bar cutting, and ossicle polishing, and 
topological simulations for repositioning ossicles to align the 
tiny ossicles in suitable positions. 
3.2 Case of comparative study 
Another volume by the same CT machine (256  256  53 
with 1.25 mm intervals between slices and 0.7 mm pixel 
resolutions in the slices) with no right ear diseases was used to 
demonstrate the segmentation, bone surface reconstruction and 
opening simulation result for comparative study. Figure 8 
shows the segmentation results for the ossicles in the right ear 
on several transverse CT slices that are demonstrated in the 
gravity direction order. In Figs. 8(B)-(D), one inside bone in 
the tympanic cavity is recognized. In Fig. 8(A), the cavity is 
not closed; therefore, the inside bone is not highlighted. Figure 
9 shows the reconstructed images in which the tiny ear ossicles 
were highlighted so that the surgeon zoomed in (from Fig. 9(A)) 
to an optimal perspective (as shown in Fig. 9(B)) and opened 
the tympanic cavity. Although the ossicles were segmented in 
fewer slices than the slices in the first case, the sizes and shapes 
of the malleus and incus in the two cases are similar. That 
indicates the 3D reconstruction (marching cubes method) can 
generate continuous ossicle surfaces by the CT slices with the 
ossicles segmented (highlighted as blue) or not (gray). 
Meanwhile, a bone bar from the temporal bone to fixate the 
incus as the first case was not observed in this case.
