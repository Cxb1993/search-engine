Abstract—In this project, we tackle the multicast problem with the consideration of the interference between 
multicast trees in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks (MR-MC WMNs). We consider a dynamic 
traffic model, i.e., multicast session requests arrive dynamically without any prior knowledge of future requests. 
Each node in the network acts as a Transit Access Point (TAP), and has one or multiple radios tuned to 
non-overlapping channels. We prove that in MRMC WMNs, the minimum cost multicast tree (MCMT) problem, 
i.e., finding the multicast tree with minimum transmission cost, is NP-hard. We then formulate the problem by an 
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to solve it optimally, and propose a polynomial-time near-optimal 
algorithm, called Wireless Closest Terminal Branching (WCTB), for the MCMT problem. To alleviate the 
interference between multicast trees (sessions), we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes the 
minimum interference minimum cost path in MR-MC WMNs, and integrate it into WCTB without altering the 
performance bound of WCTB on the tree cost.  The experimental study shows that the tree cost produced by 
WCTB is very close to the optimal and that the proposed algorithm for interference alleviation is effective. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the MCMT problem in MR-MC WMNs.

I. INTRODUCTION 
IRELESS mesh networks (WMNs) have received much attention in recent years due to its low 
up-front cost, easy network maintenance, robustness, and reliable service coverage [1-2]. In such 
networks, packets are forwarded in a multi-hop fashion from the source node to the destination node. 
Each node in the network acts as a Transit Access Point (TAP), and is usually stationary and not 
power-constrained. Some nodes in the network may have direct connections to wired networks and 
serve as gateways for the other nodes to access the Internet.  
One crucial issue in WMNs is the capacity degradation problem [3-5] due to the interference 
between wireless links. Previous work [6-7] shows that employing multiple non-overlapping 
channels is an effective approach to overcoming this problem and many research efforts have been 
devoted to developing MAC protocols [8-9], channel assignment schemes [6,10], and routing 
algorithms [7,11] for multi-radio multi-channel (MR-MC) WMNs. In this paper, with the goal of 
utilizing of radio resource efficient, we study the minimum cost multicast tree (MCMT) problem in 
MR-MC WMNs, where the cost refers to the transmission cost required for a source to deliver one 
packet to a group of receivers. We consider a dynamic traffic pattern, i.e., multicast routing (session) 
requests arrive one by one without any prior knowledge of future requests. Every time a new 
multicast session arrives, the MCMT problem arises. 
In wired networks, the MCMT problem is known as the Steiner tree problem [12], which is 
W 
  4 
based on this multicast structure. However, their approach is not suitable for dynamic multicast 
traffic but for one single multicast session with determined traffic pattern. 
While the MCMT problem in wired networks is well studied [12-17], this problem receives less 
attention in WMNs [19-22], especially in MR-MC WMNs [24]. In this paper, we tackle the MCMT 
problem in MR-MC WMNs with a dynamic traffic model. We separate the routing problem from the 
channel assignment problem, and assume that the channel assignment is given and static [10]. This 
is because the traffic demand is unpredictable, and thus solving the routing problem along with the 
channel assignment problem for future multicast sessions in advance may be meaningless [7, 23]. 
The interplay between routing and channel assignment in MR-MC WMNs can be found in our 
previous work in [25]. We prove that the MCMT problem in MR-MC WMNs is NP-hard, and 
present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to optimally solve the MCMT problem. We also 
propose a centralized polynomial-time near-optimal algorithm, called Wireless Closest Terminal 
Branching (WCTB), for the MCMT problem, and analyze its theoretical performance bound and 
complexity. Furthermore, we also consider load balancing across channels in our multicast routing 
algorithm. As we have mentioned earlier, to describe a multicast tree, we have to specify the 
constitutive nodes and the channels that they use to communicate. Channels may thus be unequally 
loaded if some channels are used for more multicast trees than the others. Since the load of a channel 
is location-dependent in wireless environments and can be captured by the local co-channel 
interference [5,7,11], our algorithm aims at distributing load across channels by minimizing the 
co-channel interference between multicast trees. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that finds 
the minimum interference minimum cost path in MR-MC WMNs, and integrate it into WCTB 
without altering the performance bound of WCTB on the tree cost. The experimental study shows 
that the tree cost produced by WCTB is very close to the optimal and that the proposed algorithm for 
interference alleviation is indeed effective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that 
studies the MCMT problem in MR-MC WMNs. Overall, the main contributions of this paper

a link in the network. Each edge in E is denoted by kji ),( , representing an link that is incident from 
node i to node j and operates on channel k. We assume that each radio has a common transmission 
range and a common interference range. A pair of directed edges kji ),(  and kij ),(  exist in E between 
two vertices if the nodes i and j are located within the transmission range of each other and have a 
radio tuned to channel k. Fig. 1(a) shows the network graph of a 7-node MR-MC WMN, where the 
number on each edge represents the channel on which this link operates. For example, nodes H and J 
can communicate with each other on channel 3 or 5, so there are four directed edges, (H,J)3, (J,H)3, 
(H,J)5, and (J,H)5 in the network graph.  
III. CONSTRUCTING MINIMUM COST MULTICAST TREES  
A. Problem Description 
We focus on on-line multicast routing in MR-MC WMNs. When a multicast routing request 
arrives in the system, the multicast tree problem arises in determining the paths for a source node to 
deliver its data to a group of receivers (terminals).  The cost of a multicast tree is defined as the 
number of transmissions. The considered problem in this paper is to find the minimum cost multicast 
tree (MCMT) in MR-MC WMNs. For example, Fig. 1(b) depicts such an optimal  multicast tree (in 
bold arrows) for the network graph shown in Fig. 1(a), where node A is the source node (i.e., the 
double-circled vertex) and nodes D, J, and U are the terminals (grey vertices) of the new multicast 
session. There are four transmissions specified, namely, from node A to node L (on channel 2), from 
node L to node J (on channel 4), from node J to both nodes H and U (on channel 5), and from node H 
to node D (on channel 5). Therefore, the total cost is four.  
In this paper, a multicast tree is represented by a set of directed edges. For example, the multicast 
tree shown in Fig. 1(b) is { 2)L,A( , 4)J,L( , 5)H,J( , 5)U,J( , 5)D,H( }. Note that there are five edges 
in the tree but the total transmission cost is only four. In this paper, a node is referred to as a 
transmitting node on channel k in multicast tree T if it is responsible for forwarding multicast data to 
  8 
of binary variables, },,,:{ , QkjiVjiX kji  . Xi-j,k equals one if the multicast tree includes a 
directed edge kji ),( , and zero otherwise. For example, the multicast tree shown in Fig. 1(b) 
specifies that only XA-L,2, XL-J,4, XJ-U,5, XJ-H,5, and XH-D,5 are set to one. Clearly, if a directed edge 
kji ),(  is included in the multicast tree, it must exist in G. Therefore, we have the following 
constraints. 
.,,,,,, QkjiVjicX kjikji    
We employ the network flow model used in [26] to ensure that the resulting multicast tree indeed 
spans all terminals in M. The basic idea of this network flow model is described as follows. First, the 
source node s injects |M| units of energy into the multicast tree, where |M| represents the number of 
terminals in M. This energy flow is split at each branching vertex of the tree into sub-flows such that 
the amount of energy of each sub-flow for each sub-tree equals the number of terminals in that 
sub-tree. If a vertex that an energy flow goes through is a terminal, it consumes one unit of energy. 
Otherwise, it just relays the energy flow without consuming any energy. Using this flow model, we 
can guarantee that the resulting multicast tree indeed spans all of the terminals by ensuring that each 
terminal receives at least one unit of energy through the paths included in the tree. We let Fi-j denote 
the aggregate amount of energy going from vertex i to vertex j (on any channel). Consider the 
multicast tree shown in Fig. 1(b). The corresponding non-zero energy flows are shown in Fig. 2. 
First, the source vertex A sends 3 units of energy to vertex L (i.e., FA-L=3). Vertex L relays this 
energy flow to vertex J without consuming any energy (i.e., FL-J=3). Since vertex J is a terminal, it 
consumes one unit of energy and then splits the remaining two units of energy equally for vertices U 
and H, respectively (i.e., FJ-U=1 and FJ-H=1). Again, vertex H just relays the energy flow to terminal 
D without consuming any energy (i.e., FH-D=1). Finally, vertices D and U both receive 1 unit of 
energy.  
With the above network flow model, we have the following constraints. First, the source node s

For the optimal multicast tree shown in Fig. 1(b), we have YA,2=1, YL,4=1, YJ,5=1, and YH,5=1, and 
thus the tree cost is YA,2+YL,4+ YJ,5+YH,5=4. The ILP formulation for the MCMT problem is 
summarized in Fig. 3. 
C. An Approximation Algorithm for the MCMT problem  
Next, we propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, called Wireless Closest Terminal 
Branching (WCTB), for the MCMT problem. The main idea of WCTB is that at each step, one new 
branch is added to the current multicast tree to reach a new terminal (i.e., a receiver which has not 
been spanned by the current tree) that is closest to the source node. In WCTB, the cost of each link in 
the network graph is initialized to one. The crux is that when a new branch is included into the 
multicast tree, the costs of links may become zero (due to the broadcast advantage). Different from 
the algorithms for constructing multicast trees in wired networks [15,27], WCTB intends to exploit 
the wireless broadcast advantage to reduce the tree cost. The beauty of WCTB is that it enjoys 
excellent performance (shown later), and is easy to implement based on Dijkstra’s algorithm. 
Before proceeding to elaborate on WCTB, we introduce the link classification in WCTB. We let T 
denote the current tree constructed in WCTB. Note that the algorithm terminates when T spans all 
terminals in M. When a link, say kji ),( , is added to T, the increased tree cost due to this new link 
depends on how the current tree grows. Normally, adding a new edge into T increments the tree cost 
by one. However, if node i is already a transmitting node on channel k in T before link kji ),(  is 
added, the increased tree cost due to this link T is zero. This is because this new edge does not 
increase the number of transmitting nodes in T, and thus does not increase the tree cost (see 
Definition 1). In this paper, we refer to such zero-cost directed links which are not included in the 
current tree as covered links. Note that in WCTB, links already included in T also have zero cost 
since reusing these links to establish a new branch does not increase the tree cost. WCTB is formally

IV. ALLEVIATING THE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN MULTICAST TREES 
In the previous section, we focus on minimizing the cost of the multicast tree for a new multicast 
session. In addition to transmission cost, interference between links is another important issue to 
consider for routing in WMNs. Improper routing may cause severe interference, leading to packet 
losses, network congestion, and starvations. In this section, we study how to alleviate the 
interference between multicast sessions by carefully constructing multicast trees. Specifically, we 
aim at minimizing the interference between the new multicast tree (for the new multicast session) 
and the existing multicast trees while ensuring the resulting tree cost is bounded. 
  14 
multicast tree Tnew that is rooted at s and spans all terminals in M with the least tree co-channel 
interference w.r.t. Tset. 
The MIMT problem can be easily proved to be NP-hard with the reduction from the MCMT 
problem in single-channel WMNs [19]. Clearly, it is very difficult to solve the MCMT problem and 
the MIMT problem at the same time, i.e., to find a multicast tree that has the least tree cost and the 
least tree co-channel interference. To jointly tackle these two problems, we extend WCTB by 
replacing the min_cost_path procedure used in WCTB (see line 8 in Algorithm 1) with a 
polynomial-time algorithm, called Minimum Interference Minimum Cost Routing (MIMCR). Given 
a source node and a destination node, MIMCR computes the minimum interference minimum cost 
path, which is defined as a path that has the least path co-channel interference among all minimum 
cost paths. Since the returned path of MIMCR is still a minimum cost path, the performance bound 
of WCTB on the tree cost remains the same, i.e., Theorem 3 still holds for WCTB with this 
extension. Note that there are three reasons why we may not be able to find the path with the 
minimum cost and also the minimum path co-channel interference. First, since the path cost and the 
co-channel interference of a path are two additive metrics, finding an optimal path with two additive 
metrics is NP-complete [28]. Second, such an optimal path may not even exist in the network 
because minimizing the path cost and minimizing the interference of a path tend to be two 
conflicting objectives [7, 11, 23]. Third, it is shown in [29] that taking low-interference (but maybe 
more costly) paths may not be beneficial to the system performance in terms of throughput in the 
long run, so we give the transmission cost precedence over the co-channel interference. 
We describe MIMCR in details as follows. As in Section III-C, we let T denote the current 
multicast tree in WCTB. The set of existing multicast trees in the network is denoted by Tset. 
Suppose MIMCR is called in WCTB to compute a minimum interference minimum cost path from 
the source node s to a new terminal m. First, MIMCR constructs an auxiliary directed acyclic graph  
  16 
simulated scenario is described by four parameters, namely f, n, t, and c, where f is the total number 
of multicast sessions, n is the number of nodes placed in the network, t is the number of terminals, 
and c is the total number of available channels in the system. Multicast sessions arrive in the system 
one by one without any prior knowledge of future arrivals. The source node and the t terminals of 
each multicast session are randomly selected. Each node has three radios. To decouple the effect of 
the channel assignment algorithm, the three radios of each node are tuned to three randomly selected 
distinct channels. All nodes are randomly placed within a 1000m  1000m square, and the 
transmission range and the interference range of each radio are set to 300m and 600m, respectively. 
We only consider connected networks and ignore orphan radios (i.e., radios that are tuned to 
channels not used by any neighboring node) [5, 23]. 
In the first scenario, we let f=20, n=31, and c=7, but vary t from 5 to 30. We compare the tree cost 
produced by WCTB with the optimal value obtained by solving the ILP model presented in Section 
III using the LINDO mixed integer linear programming solver [30]. Fig. 7(a) depicts the average tree 
cost for the first scenario, where the curve labeled unicast represents the number of transmissions 
needed for the source node to deliver one packet to each receiver via unicast and the curve labeled 
shortest path tree represents the tree cost when the modified Pruned Dijkstra heuristic [15] is used. 
From this figure, we notice that the performance of WCTB is very close to the optimal and much 
better than the unicast delivery. In fact, from the simulation results, we find that the tree cost 
produced by WCTB is never more than twice of the optimal, even though Dmax in cases may be 
higher than 7. In the second scenario, we let f=20, t=15, and c=7, but vary n from 21 to 41. Fig. 7(b) 
shows the average tree cost for this scenario. As can be seen, the tree cost produced by WCTB is 
about 1.3 times of the optimal value, and only about one-third of the total transmission cost with 
unicast delivery. In the third scenario, we let f=20, n=31, and t=15, but vary c from 5 to 11. The 
average tree cost is shown in Fig. 7(c). Obviously, no matter how many channels are available in the 
network, WCTB always enjoys performance very close to the optimal. Moreover, from this figure, 
  18 
effectively reduce the interference between multicast trees. In the future, we will develop a multicast 
routing protocol which implements the WCTB and MIMCR algorithms. We also plan to extend 
WCTB to multi-rate environments, where nodes may communicate with each other at different data 
rates in order to combat channel deterioration.

        會議報告 
 
一 參加會議經過 
 
本次出國開會主要是到南非開普敦(Cape Town)參加 IEEE ICC 2010 的國際
研討會，並發表二篇論文，其題目分別為〝' C2AR: Coding and Capacity Aware 
Routing for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks〞及“DH-MAC: A Dynamic Channel Hopping 
MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks”。 IEEE ICC 為目前 IEEE 在通訊領
域最重要的國際會議之一，此會議將論文分為 10 個 parallel 進行的 symposia 及 
1 general sessions 進行口頭報告及討論，並有 exhibition 同時進行。 此會議將論
文安排成三天，中間穿插著 panel discussions, business application sessions 及 幾
個 keynote speeches 。  今年的主題主要包括 Communications Theory 、
Communications QoS, Reliability and Performance Modeling、Communications and 
Information Systems Security、Optical Network and Systems、Signal Processing for 
Communications、Wireless Communications、 Wireless Networking、Next Generation 
Networking、Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks、Communication Software and Service。  
 
除了專業報告外，會後更與多位對此協定有關及有興趣的人士進行討論。此
外，除了自己的 session 之外，也參與其他相關的演講及討論，已確實掌握綴新
技術發展現況，並激發新的研究想法。此外，我也參加了幾個 Communications 
Society 的 meetings，包括 IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications Editorial 
Board Meeting、及 IEEE ICC 2010 Organization Committee Dinner (as a TPC 
Co-Chair of Next Generation Internet and Networking Symposium)。最後，我在 
IEEE ICC 2010 Award Ceremony 接受 IEEE Fellow Reorganization by ComSoc。   
 
二與會心得與建議 
 
由 IEEE ICC2010 的論文發表來看，很明顯的目前的技術趨勢仍以 wireless 
為主，比較值得注意的是，現在參與陀暨研討會的大陸學者相當多，他們也都十
分活耀，相形之下，台灣學者就稍嫌 quiet 了一些。
