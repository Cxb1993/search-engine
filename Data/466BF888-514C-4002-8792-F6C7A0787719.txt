一. 前言 
 
Recently, through the thick-film technology, the fabrication of the sensing 
element and the electronic circuits in a single compatible technology were developed. 
Thus, the cost of the thick-film electrochemical electrode is significantly lower than 
the conventional methods. Various modifiers, such as mediators [5], enzymes [6], 
ion-selective membrane [7], and metal particles [8], have been added into the printing 
paste to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the screen-printed carbon electrode. 
Based on the above reasons, this study attempted to modify a carbon electrode based 
on the tin oxide (SnO2) sensing membrane to design an all solid-state pH sensor. In 
contrast to the other thick film sensors [9-11], the sputtering method was used to 
control the sensing membrane quality. Moreover, other immobile technology was 
used to develop a miniature multi-sensor cartridge for detecting human physiology 
parameter and realizing homecare detection more practically. 
pH value is one of the most important parameters in liquid analysis and control. 
For example, the normal pH range of the health human blood is pH 7.35 to pH 7.4. 
Up to now, the pH scale has become popular with the discovery of pH glass electrode 
and the invention of commercially successful electronic pH meter in 1934 by Prof. 
Arnold O. Beckman [12]. In today’s world, the pH sensor is still the most widely used 
in many chemical and biological processes. However, the commercial glass electrode 
has some disadvantages, such as the wet storage, hardly clean, high cost, and simple 
split. Therefore, in order to overcome these drawbacks, different steps of 
potentiometric pH sensors were presented, such as ISFET [12], EGFET [12], 
SnO2–based pH sensor [12] and coated wire electrode (CWE) [12]. The main 
detection principle of the pH sensor is that the pH value (hydrogen ion activity) of 
 3
reference electrode is difficult to meet while exploiting solid-state technology on a 
single device. Therefore, this project presents a potentiometric urea and creatinine 
biosensors.

If there are no current passes, the ratio of the two forms of the surface oxide will 
remain constant and the open circuit potential of the electrode will be dependent on 
the H+ concentration. At 25 ℃, this will be shown in Eq. (2.5).

As shown in Eq. (2.5), this relationship is called the Nernst equation, which 
explains the relation between the slop factor and standard potential for the soaked 
electrodes. Therefore, by the equilibrium of portion exchange of the SnO2 membrane, 
the SnO2 pH electrode can be employed as the pH sensor and practically detect the pH 
value of the aqueous solution.

2.3 Ion selective field effect transistor (ISFET), extended gate field 
effect transistor (EGFET) 
 
pH is one of the most important parameters in liquid analysis and control. The 
pH scale has become popular with the development of the pH glass electrode and the 
invention of commercially successful electronic pH meter in 1934 by Prof. Arnold O. 
Beckman [12]. The pH sensor is widely used in various industries because many 
chemical and biological processes are dependent on the pH. The ion selective field 
effect transistor (ISFET) was firstly invented by P. Bergveld in 1970 [12]. Typically, 
an ISFET was like a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) but 
without a gate electrode. Therefore, most of the literatures dealing with the ISFET 
operational mechanisms start with the theoretical description of a MOSFET [43, 44]. 
As aforementioned descriptions, Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional view of the ISFET 
[2]. The advantages of the ISFET include its ion selective membrane, multi-sensors 
capability, low output impedance and fast pH response with the outstanding 
achievements of the integrated circuit (IC) technology [45]. However, its drawback is 
that it requires a stringent encapsulation of both the chip edges and bonding leads 
[46]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 11
An extended gate field effect transistor (EGFET) is another approach to get an 
isolation of field effect transistor (FET) from the chemical environment. The general 
description of the EGFET is shown in the Fig. 3 [3]. The EGFET consists of a 
chemically sensitive layer or layers on the end of a wire whose other end is connected 
to a high input impedance buffer [3]. Typically, the EGFET is separated into two parts, 
one is a sensing electrode with a disposable structure, and the other is a commercial 
MOSFET [47, 48]. The structure has the advantage of disposable sensing electrode, 
because the separate MOSFET is reusable when the sensing electrode is changed and 
discarded. In 2001, Chin et al. [4] designed an EGFET based on the standard 
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 0.5 μm process (Double ploy 
double metal with UMC IC Foundry Company), and Fig. 4 shows the layout diagram 
of the EGFET in this literature. Furthermore, a multi-sensors chip was presented for 
compensating the temperature effect and the light effect [1]. However, the charges 
could be leaked from the silicon layer into the conductor layer, aluminum (Al), in the 
sensing part, so critical encapsulation is still required for this structure. Typically, in 
order to increase sensing characteristics of the EGFET, the sensing area of the EGFET 
is larger than 300μm ×300 μm. But, as for the sensor fabrication, the standard CMOS 
process will also increase the fabrication cost. Thus, Yin et al. [13] ever presented the 
tin oxide (SnO2) pH sensor, which was deposited on the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass 
by the sputtering method in 2000. According to this literature, the SnO2 pH sensor is 
also very suitable and powerful for the applications of pH detection [13].

3.12 Creatinine measurement 
 
     Materials used in the ion-selective membrane preparation were as follows: 
nonactin was purchased from Fluka, bis-(2-etylhexyl) sebacate (DOS), 
tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and carboxylated 
polyvinylchloride (PVC-COOH) were all purchased from Aldrich. Creatinine 
iminohydrolase (CIH) with activity 250 units was obtained from Sigma. A 
plastic-plate using photocrosslinkable polyvinyl alcohol containing stilbazolium 
groups (PVA-SbQ) was obtained from Toyo Gosei Co., Ltd., Japan. All the other 
reagents were of analytical grade. Moreover, analytical grade reagents were used to 
prepare buffer solutions. All calibration and buffer solutions were prepared with 
deionized (D.I.) water. The buffer of the creatinine biosensor contained 20 mM 
Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) and 1.0 mM ethylenediaminete-traacetic 
acid (EDTA) (this prevents enzyme inhibition by heavy metal ions) was adjusted with 
HCl at a pH of 7.5. The creatinine concentrations of the creatinine biosensors were 2 
μM ~ 255 μM by the standard creatinine buffer solution.

3.4 Enzyme immobilization of urea and creatinine biosensors 
 
A configuration of pH sensor based on SnO2/ITO glass was fabricated. A tin 
oxide thin film was deposited on the ITO glass by the radio frequency sputtering 
system as a sensitive membrane of the pH-sensitive electrode. Before the SnO2 was 
deposited, the ITO glass was washed in methyl alcohol and then in deionized (D.I.) 
water for 15 minutes. Nonactin and the bis-(2-etylhexyl) sebacate (DOS) were applied 
as an ionophore and a plasticizer, respectively, in preparing the membrane of the 
ammonium ion-selective electrode. The typical procedure for fabricating ammonium 
membranes involved nonactin (1% wt), DOS (33% wt) and PVC-COOH (66% wt). 
This mixture was dissolved in the THF used as a solvent to form the complex 
membrane. After 12 hours the dry polymeric was incorporated into the electrode body. 
The membrane was washed with D.I. water and stored at 4°C until it was used. 
After the pH sensor and ammonium ion-selective electrode have been realized, 
the enzyme layer on the membrane surface was immobilized. Urease and creatinine 
iminohydrolase were immobilized by the entrapment method. Therefore, a liquid 
pre-polymer solution was obtained by mixing the enzyme and PVA-SbQ (125 mg) in a 
5 mM phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0. Then, the same volume of pre-polymer 
solution (2 μl) was dropped onto the PVC-COOH membrane and the SnO2 membrane 
with same area (2×2 mm2). The membranes were then exposed to UV light at 365 nm 
for around 20 minutes and stored at 4°C for 24 hours in the dark room.

pH electrode exists a pH dependent redox equilibrium between liquid and oxide 
surface. 
In this measurement, ten electrodes were picked out for testing. The output 
voltage versus a commercial silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode 
(GB-900E) was measured in different buffer solutions (pH2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) which 
were detected by commercial pH meter (Suntex SP-2200) by using an instrumental 
amplifier LT1167 as readout circuit. At each change of buffer solutions, the electrode 
was rinsed in deionized water (D.I.) and then allowed to equilibrate for one minute 
before the instrumental amplifier LT1167 potential was measured. 
The pH electrode based on the SnO2/ITO glass electrode was measured in 
different buffer solutions to prove its sensing characteristics, and the pH range was 
between pH 2 and pH 12. The calibration curve reveals a stable sensor response and 
the average sensitivity was 45.64 mV/pH. The SnO2 pH electrode by sputtering 
method which shows the sensitivity is about 58 mV/pH between pH2 and pH12. In 
order to control the sensing characteristics, the sputtering method is one effective 
technology. According to the optimal conditions [52-54], the mixed flow ratio of 
oxygen and argon proportion is 1:4 and plasma radio frequency power is 50W and the 
deposition pressure is 20 mTorr. The calibration curves were plotted against pH and 
output voltage versus time was shown in Figs. 8 and 9.

4.3 Potentiometric response of the ammonium ion-selective electrodes 
 
The ammonium ion-selective electrode was calibrated in Tris-HCl buffer with 
various ammonium concentrations. The electrode rapidly reached a steady state, with 
a detection limit of 10-5 M and a lower limit of 10-4 M on the linear range. The 
calibration curves of ten ammonium ion-selective electrodes from one group revealed 
an average slope in the linear range (10-4 ~ 1 M, pH 7.5) of 51.73±2.43 mV/decade. It 
can be seen from Fig. 4 that the slopes were reproducible and Fig. 11 shows the drift 
of the ammonium ion-selective electrode that indicate drifts of 9.87 mV in 10 hours. 
The ammonium ion-selective electrode was found to be stable and reproducible 
between pH 6.0 and pH 8.0.

(1) In this study, the potentiometric solid state biosensors based on SnO2/ITO 
glass were described. The solid state biosensors were fabricated by enzyme 
immobilization method and r.f. sputtering processes. It shows good sensitive 
performance about 58mV/pH between pH2 and pH12. According to the 
experimental results, the biosensor based on the SnO2/ITO glass could be 
applied to ion-selective electrode and biosensors. Therefore, this study designs 
a biosensor system, which has a lot of advantages such as solid state structure, 
planar device, and low cost.  
(2) In this study, the response time (t95 value) were less than 15 seconds for the 
urea biosensor and less than 30 seconds for the creatinine biosensor. Based on 
the experimental results, the difference of the response time between both 
types of biosensors may be due to the detection mechanism of ammonium ions 
via the enzymatic hydrolysis process. Moreover, the urea and creatinine 
biosensors based on ammonium ion-selective electrodes, the storage periods of 
the urea and creatinine biosensors are larger than one month. 
(3) In this study, the calibration curves were obtained for a buffer solution with a 
urea and creatinine concentration range of 0.8 μM to 20 mM and 2μM to 
255μM based on ammonium ion-selective electrode, respectively. 
(4) In this study, the urea and creatinine biosensors based on ammonium 
ion-selective electrodes showed good operational stability (over 10 times 
operation).
