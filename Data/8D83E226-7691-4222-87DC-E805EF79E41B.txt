Abstract –The paralleling DC/DC converters via primary 
current droop current sharing control is presented in this 
paper. Firstly, the steady state droop voltage characteristics are 
deduced from the output voltage regulation specification and 
then the parameters of the feedback weighted voltage resistor 
network can be determined accordingly. Hereafter, the inner 
loop voltage controller of the converter is designed by using pole 
placement scheme at a given bandwidth and phase margin. 
Furthermore, when single DC/DC converter is operated, one 
can find that the loop gain characteristics will not affect 
significantly via output, inductor and primary currents sensing 
schemes. Unfortunately, the cross coupling effect will occurs at 
paralleling operation. In order to improve the cross coupling 
effects, a droop voltage controller is proposed. Finally, an 
interleaved dual switch forward converter with an output 
inductor was used to verify the proposed control method. The 
effectiveness of the proposed scheme will be demonstrated by 
the simulation and experimental results.. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The paralleled operating DC/DC converter can have the 
advantages of improving system reliability, well thermal 
distribution and high efficiency and thus be widely used in 
the frond end and load converters. However, to obtain equal 
current sharing among converters is one of the important 
characteristics of the paralleling distributed power system. In 
order to achieve this goal, there are a lot of current sharing 
schemes have been proposed in the literature [1]. Among 
them, the droop current sharing method is claimed that is 
very easy to implement and expand, no wire connection 
among converters and also having high modularity [1-6]. 
But, it suffers poor load regulation characteristics due to 
droop voltage characteristics; furthermore, the accuracy 
current sharing is primarily depended on the accuracy of the 
initial referent voltage setting and circuit parameters. In order 
to obtain the reliability of the equal current sharing capability 
through the product life cycle, the parameters of the droop 
voltage control loop and initial referent voltage setting must 
be stable in the entire life cycle [2].  
In the previous studies, most of the droop current sharing 
control was obtained by sensing the output and inductor 
current. Therefore, the major object of this paper is to design 
and analysis the current sharing control of DC/DC converter 
via primary current droop current sharing control method. 
Firstly, a systematic design procedure was deduced to 
determine the parameters of the feedback resistor network 
based on the output voltage regulation specification. In the 
next, the droop current sharing control loop is studied. It can 
be found that the droop current sharing loop forms an extra 
control loop to synthesize control efforts from its duty ratio to 
the other paralleled operation DC/DC converters and result in 
cross coupling effect. In order to reduce the cross coupling 
effect of the droop current sharing scheme, a droop voltage 
controller is designed to augment in its original voltage 
controller. Finally, the design procedures of the proposed 
method will provide, furthermore, the effectiveness of the 
proposed method will be verified by the simulation and 
experimental results.  
 
II OUTPUT DROOP VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS 
 
Fig. 1 shows an interleaved dual switch forward converter 
(IDSFC) via an output inductor is under studied in this paper, 
where the symbols iV , n , oV , oI  and iI  are denoted as 
input voltage, transformer turn ratio, output voltage, output 
current and input current, respectively. Furthermore, the 
output stage is comprised of the output inductor L , output 
capacitor C  and equivalent load resistance R . Through 
distributed power and magnetic devices structure, well 
thermal management and high efficiency operation can be 
obtained. It is worth to note the control strategy of the IDSFC 
shown in Fig. 1 may be used current or voltage mode controls 
due to one output inductor topology and leads to the primary 
side currents of the two forward converters can be equal 
current sharing automatically. Therefore, the voltage mode 
control scheme is adopted here for ease of implementation. A 
simple two parameters configuration controller )(1 sGc , 
)(2 sGc  to incorporate with the primary current droop current 
sharing controller )(sGdr  was used as a voltage controller,

From Fig. 1, one can find the equivalent control block diagram 
of the paralleled operation DC/DC converters system can be 
obtained from Fig. 4. The voltage and droop loop gains of the 
ith  DC/DC converter operating alone are denoted as vT  and 
droopT , respectively, and can be derived as 
KHGGT ccv 21=                                 (13) 
difdrcdroop FGKGGT 1=                            (14) 
where K  is denoted as the gain of the PWM comparator. As a 
result, the total loop gain of the single ith  DC/DC converter is 
droopvloop TTT +=                           (15) 
It is worth to note that the control performance of the ith  
DC/DC converter is affected by the cross coupling effect of 
the droop loop gain droopT  by the other converters and thus 
required to further investigation. In order to reduce the 
coupling effects due to extra droop voltage loop, properly 
design the droop voltage controller )(sGdr  is indispensable. 
In general, the voltage loop of the single DC/DC converter 
must be designed firstly for a redundant power system. After 
that, the outer current sharing loop control is designed so the 
well current sharing control performance can be obtained.  
 
(1) Voltage loop design  
From Figs. 1 and 4, the duty ratio to output voltage transfer 
function of the single converter can be obtained from (4) as

There are two pole-zero assignment methods suggested in the 
literature [8, 9]. Basically, it assigns a pole 1pω  to cancel the 
zero 3zω  produced by the equivalent series resistance of the 
output capacitor and uses two zeros 2zω  and 3zω  to reduce 
the resonant peak effect caused by the output filter. At last, to 
place a pole oω  is for desired gain crossover frequency and 
phase margin, and another pole 2pω  is used to filter out the 
high frequency switching noise. Using aforementioned pole 
assignment scheme, the desired voltage loop gain can be 
simplified as

However, the parameter variation of the transfer function 
)(sH  is occurred at different load current operating condition 
and led to modeling errors. In order to reduce the modeling 
error, it is suggested to increase gain margin of the DC/DC 
converter. If the gain margin is designed to greater than 10dB, 
the control performance due to parameters mismatch can be 
reduced significantly. 
  
(2)Droop current sharing controller design 
If the droop controller )(sGdr  is a simple resistor 3R  as 
in the previous study [2], the Bode plots of the loop gain 
transfer function (15) via output and primary current feedback 
droop schemes for the single ith  DC/DC converter are shown 
in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5, one can find the gain crossover 
frequency of the designed DC/DC converter voltage loop gain

can be estimated and listed in the appendix. Using Simplis 
circuit simulator, the Bode plot of the DC/DC converter is 
depicted in Fig. 5. It can find the phase margin is 500 and the 
gain cross-over frequency is around 10kHz that is quite 
similar to previous design specification. After simulation has 
verified the loop gain of the DC/DC converter, the actual Bode 
plot measurement was carried out subsequently via AP102B 
network analyzer made by AP Instrument which was used an 
isolated transformer to inject swept sinusoidal signal into 
converter. Fig. 7 shows the Bode plot of the DC/DC converter 
with primary current droop current sharing control. The 
measurement results were also depicted the gain crossover 
frequency is around 10kHz, furthermore, the phase response 
was shown in Fig. 7(b) with 500 phase margin. 
In order to demonstrate the proposed design method, a 
measurement of the paralleled operating DC/DC converters in 
hot swap operation is provided and shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) 
depicts the hot swap operation of the DC/DC converter at a 
66A full load current. A very good dynamic current sharing 
response can be observed; furthermore, equal current sharing 
among the DC/DC converter can also be obtained. 
Furthermore, Fig. 8(b) and (c) are shown the Bode plot of the 
paralleled DC/DC converter and also provided 10kHz 
bandwidth and  500 phase margin as the original designed loop 
gain characteristics. 
 
V CONCLUSIONS 
 
A systematic method to design and analysis of the droop 
current sharing control via primary current sensing is 
presented in this paper. Through the output voltage regulation 
specification, the desired feedback weighted voltage resistors 
can be determined. Then, the voltage and droop voltage 
controllers are designed in according with the small signal 
modeling of the paralleled DC/DC converter system.
