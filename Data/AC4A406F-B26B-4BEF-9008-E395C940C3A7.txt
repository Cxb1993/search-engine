Abstract 
 
 Impaired hand function is common 
following stroke and this impairment has a 
dramatic, negative impact on the quality of 
life. Lack of finger muscle individuation is a 
major contributor to hand dysfunction and 
rehabilitation paradigms that increase the 
ability to selectively activate hand muscles 
may significantly improve hand function in 
the stroke population. Recently, it was shown 
in unimpaired individuals that muscle 
vibration can be used to alter the excitability 
of the motor pathways controlling hand 
muscles, and that these alterations differ 
between vibrated and non-vibrated muscles. A 
PI’s previous study conducted in the U.S. has 
demonstrated in a few subjects that vibration 
also can be used to modulate the corticomotor 
excitability of hand muscles in individuals 
following stroke. If this vibration-induced 
modulation can lead to better control of hand 
movements, muscle vibration might be a 
useful tool for stroke hand rehabilitation. The 
purpose of this project is to establish an 
experimental platform to continue this line of 
research in order to quantify muscle-vibration 
corticomotor excitability in hand muscles of 
individuals following chronic stroke; 
however, significant inter-subject variations 
on muscle vibration-modulated corticomotor 
excitability patterns were also identified in a 
small group of subjects (Yang, Settle et al. 
2006). Therefore, the purpose of this study 
is to continue on this line of research to 
examine the effects of vibratory afferent 
inputs on the excitability of the cortical area 
controlling hand muscles in individuals 
following chronic stroke. We specifically 
established a platform for conducting the 
experiment.   
 
Methods 
 
The primary goal of this project was to 
establish an experimental platform which 
can provide muscle vibration and 
simultaneously conduct neurophysiological 
measurements, i.e. using TMS to elicit 
motor-evoked potentials in target muscles 
measured by electromyography, and is 
extendable to include biomechanical 
evaluations in the future.  
The developing platform will be used 
to conduct experiment following a protocol 
developed previously, which is briefly 
described below (Yang, Settle et al. 2006). 
The schematic of the protocol and platform 
is shown in Figure 1. 
The subject will be seated with upper 
extremities supported by custom-made 
armrests at 45° of shoulder flexion, 30° 
shoulder abduction, and 135° of elbow 
extension. Muscle vibration (MV) will be 
delivered to the muscle belly of individual 
hand muscles, bilateral abductor pollicis 
brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseus (FDI), 
or abductor digiti minimi (ADM), by an 
electromagnetic vibrator (FG 142 Force 
Generator, Labwork Inc.) with a 
custom-made probe (7 mm in diameter). The 
vibration frequency will be set at 80 Hz and 
the amplitude adjusted to be just below each 
subject’s threshold for perceiving an illusory 
movement (Roll, Vedel et al. 1989).

protocol and platform 
 
The excitability of contralaterally 
descending motor pathways will be assessed 
by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 
TMS will be performed using a Magstim 
2002 stimulator connecting to a 
figure-of-eight-shaped coil with 70 
mm-diameter internal wing (Magstim, 
Dyfed, UK). The coil will be held over the 
motor cortex at the optimal position to 
obtain motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in 
the target muscles in the stroke-affected 
hand (or the dominant hand of the control 
subjects).  
Surface electromyography (EMG) 
recording will be employed to determine the 
MEP following each TMS stimulus. 
Self-adhesive disposable electrodes 
(Noraxon USA Inc, Arizona, USA) will be 
applied over the muscle bellies with an 
interelectrode distance of 20 mm; EMG

Discussion 
 
We successfully established an 
experimental platform which can allow us 
further examine muscle vibration-induced 
neurophysiological modulations in domestic 
individuals following stroke. We also, in a 
preliminary study, demonstrated that small 
amplitude muscle vibration in either the 
stroke-affected or the non-affected hand 
could alter the corticomotor excitability of 
the area controlling the affected hand 
muscles. MV-induced modulations in 
corticomotor excitability varied across our 
chronic stroke subjects, with MV-induced 
facilitation occurred in selected motor 
pathways, while in our control subjects MV 
facilitates MEPs following TMS in the 
vibrated muscle and inhibits motor pathway 
excitability in the non-vibrated same-hand 
muscles.  
Large inter-subject variations were 
observed in the MV-induced modulations of 
corticomotor excitability in individuals 
following stroke. These subject-specific 
MV-induced modulations might be partly 
due to sensory and/or motor reorganization 
following stroke (Ward 2004). The 
interactions between afferent inputs and 
voluntarily generated motor commands are 
the basis of unimpaired motor behavior and 
may be critical to restoring motor function 
following stroke. We will use the 
experimental platform developed in this 
project to quantify muscle vibration-induced 
modulations of corticomotor excitability in 
domestic individuals following stroke, and 
evaluate the possibility of using muscle 
vibration as a tool for stroke hand 
rehabilitation.
