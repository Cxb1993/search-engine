 
ABSTRACT 
Understanding the genetic interactions at the system level is a crucial step to reveal the 
complex mechanisms involved in a biological process or a disease. By utilizing modern high 
throughput microarray technology, it has become feasible to obtain gene expressions data and 
turn it into knowledge that explains the regulatory behavior of genes. In this study, an 
unsupervised nonlinear model was proposed to infer gene regulatory networks on a 
genome-wide scale. The proposed model consists of two components, the nonlinear 
correlation estimator and the nonlinear recurrent model. The nonlinear correlation estimator 
was used to initialize the parameters of the nonlinear recurrent curve fitting model. Then the 
initialized model was used to fit the microarray data. The model was used to simulate the 
underlying nonlinear regulatory mechanisms in biological organisms. The proposed 
algorithm was applied to infer the regulatory mechanisms of the general network in S. 
cerevisiae and the pulmonary disease pathways in H. sapiens. The proposed algorithm 
requires no prior biological knowledge to predict linkages between genes. The prediction 
results were checked against true positive links obtained from the YEASTRACT database, 
the TRANSFAC database, and the KEGG database. By checking the results with known 
interactions, we showed that the proposed algorithm could determine some meaningful 
pathways, many of which are supported by the existing literature.

disadvantages are that some of them provide no direct way to obtain information about how 
multiple cooperating transcriptional factors (TFs) interact with a specific target gene. 
Furthermore, some approaches suffer from excessive computational overhead due to 
complicated mathematical modeling not suitable for applications of whole-genome analysis. 
Graphic models (Whittaker, 1990), on the other hand, provide the possibility to infer gene 
networks using a simplified model formulation. In recent studies (Wong et al., 2003; Dobra et 
al., 2004; Schäfer and Strimmer, 2005), the theory of graphic models has been extended such 
that it is possible to infer large-scale gene networks using small sample data. However, some 
of these approaches were built on some specific assumptions and they do not work out well if 
these assumptions are not met. 
 Traditional techniques for microarray technology have provided valuable insights 
towards deciphering gene regulatory networks in living organisms. In recent years, the 
ChIP-on-chip technique has become more popular in identifying physical interactions 
between TFs and the upstream sequence of genes on a genome-wide basis. Many earlier 
proposed studies (Simon et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Harbison et al., 2004) investigated the 
transcriptional regulatory elements and networks using ChIP-on-chip data. However, 
ChIP-on-chip data provides no information regarding the role of a given TF (as an activator 
or as a repressor), and is able to reveal indirect regulatory interactions. Furthermore, 
ChIP-on-chip data is known to be noisy, which leads the identification process to yield many 
false positives or false negatives. 
 In this study, we proposed an unsupervised computational model, which consists of a 
nonlinear correlation estimator and a nonlinear recurrent model, to infer gene regulatory 
interactions using time-course gene expression data. The nonlinear correlation estimator 
assesses the similarity of the expression patterns of all possible paired genes. The nonlinear 
recurrent curve-fitting model, which is initialized by the nonlinear correlation estimator, 
infers the gene regulatory interactions by discovering the causal effects of the gene 
expression levels. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the following 
sections, we describe the derivations of our approach, followed by the experimental results of 
the proposed method in S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens. Then the data sets and normalization 
procedures used in this work are presented. The gene interactions confirmed by 
YEASTRACT database (Teixeira et al., 2006) and TRANSFAC database (Matys et al., 2003), 
and KEGG database (Kanehisa et al., 2006) are then used to evaluate the performance of the 
proposed approach. Finally, a discussion regarding the advantages of the proposed approach 
as well future work for possible improvement are provided in the Discussion Section.

For a pair of genes {A, B}, where A is the regulating gene and B is the target gene, we use the 
procedure of the linear regression model to fit  ˆ AG t  and  ˆBG t  by 
        0 0, ,ˆ ˆ , ,B AA B A BG t G t t        , 
where β0 is the intercept, β{A,B} is the slope of the regression line, and ε(β0, β{A,B}, t) denotes 
the error term. Estimation of β0 and β{A,B} can be obtained by the method of the general least 
squares estimator (LSE). The LSE estimates β0 and β{A,B} by minimizing the sum of the 
squares of the residuals          0 0, ˆ, , BA B A B

approach is known to have a major drawback in that it is very sensitive to outliers. To 
overcome this problem, here, we present a robust least squares estimator (rLSE) to reduce the 
influence of outliers. We reformulate the error term by the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution as 
follows.

Since the 1st-order partial derivative step neutralizes the baseline shift effect, we can rewrite 
the error term in equation (1) by removing β0 as

This step shows the reason for using the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution. The probability density 
function of the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution suppresses the error caused by the outliers and 
leads the regression line to closer to the data points on the scatter plot. To find the least square 
solution of β{A,B}, we take the partial derivative of the summation part in equation (3) with

To obtain β{A,B}, we need to solve equation (5). It is well known that only linear regression 
models can be expressed in closed form. Because the denominator in equation (5) is 
6 
model parameters by the nonlinear correlation coefficient. The entire model consists of two 
stages, as shown in Figure 2.  
Gene Activity Extraction 
In the first stage, a scheme is used to reverse-engineer gene activities on a genome-wide 
scale using gene expression data from the microarray experiments. The concentrations of the 
mRNAs reflect the expression levels of the genes. However, the dynamics of the gene 
expressions can be approximated by ordinary differential equations containing the terms of 
mRNA degradation and production rates. The mRNA degradation model is 
    * expG t t   ,        (7) 
where G*(t') represents the quantity of newly produced mRNAs of a given gene at time t', t' 
denotes the duration of the degradation, λ = ln(1/2)/t* is the mRNA self-degradation rate, and 
t* is the half-life of the mRNA. This forms an mRNA decay model G*(t') to estimate the 
remaining mature mRNA quantity at time t' after a certain amount of the mRNAs have been 
transcribed. 
 The levels of mRNAs are mature mRNAs accumulated over time in the nucleus and in 
the cytoplasm. Thus, we formulate the expression level of mRNAs by a convolution model 
by 
        *G t P G t d t   

   ,     (8) 
where G(t) is the expression level of mRNAs, P(t) represents the quantity of mRNAs newly 
transcribed into the nucleus and the cytoplasm, G*(t) is the mRNA decay model described in 
Eq. (7), and ε(t) is the unknown noise in the data. In order to extract the quantity of mRNAs 
that have been transcribed at any given time t, we deconvolve the gene expression level G(t) 
from the mRNA decay model G*(t) as 
       inv*P t G G t d 

     .       (9) 
Note that the unknown noise ε(t) is eliminated to simplify the model. In this study, we assume 
that the quantity of mRNAs increases or decreases due to the transcription or degradation 
processes, respectively. Thus, the value of P(t) should be positive throughout all time t. If the 
minimal value of P(t) over time t is negative, it is necessary to adjust the value of the mRNA 
self-degradation rate λ to satisfy our assumptions. If necessary, we adjust the value of λ by λ* 
= ψλ, where λ* is the adjusted λ, and ψ is the refinement rate (default value is 0.99). We use 
the updated λ to compute the mRNA degradation model and P(t). This procedure is repeated 
until all values of P(t) over t are positive.  
 According to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the maximum rate of reaction mediated by 
8 
used to adjust the difference of the change ratios between genes, and the offset factor is 
utilized to remove the constant offset effect in Ai(t). We can determine the change ratio of the 
magnitude of the regulation between gene i and gene j over time from

In addition, the value of the constant offset bi is fixed at 0. 
The outputs of the first layer feed directly into the second layer, referred to as the hidden 
layer. The hidden layer is not only connected to the following layer in a feedforward manner, 
but also to a further layer, called the context layer, in a simple 1-to-1 connection. To form 
recurrent connections, the outputs of the context layer Ci(t) are also inputted into the hidden 
layer. These recurrent connections of the context layer provide the model with a short-term 
memory (e.g. Ci(t) = Hi(t - 1)). It allows the hidden layer to not only observe the actual inputs, 
but also to, via the context layer, obtain information on their own state in time lag-1. Besides 
the context layer, a latent layer is connected to the hidden layer. The outputs of the latent 
layer Li(t) are used to imitate the influences of unknown factors on the regulation of the gene 
network. Each input of the node in the hidden layer is multiplied by its corresponding weights. 
Furthermore, the output is the linear sum of the weighted activations from other layers, which 
is given by

where Hi(t) represents the activation level of gene i, hi is the offset factor used to formulate 
the bias influence in the hidden layer, and ,  and  are weights associated with 
connections from the input layer, context layer, and latent layer, respectively. Weights 
between the input layer and hidden layer  are initialized by nonlinear correlation as

where rrLSE(Gi, Gj) is the nonlinear correlation coefficient in the expression levels of paired 
genes i and j, and σGi and σGj are variances of the expression levels of paired genes i and j. 
Other weights are initialized in a random manner. The output of the hidden layer is then fed 
to the third layer, called the transformation layer. The transformation layer converts the 
activation level of a gene Hi(t) by a sigmoid function as      iT t sig H t i ,       (16) 
where Ti(t) is the transformed activation level of gene i. 
 The outputs of the transformation layer are used to predict the activation level of other 
genes at time t + 1. Each output is multiplied by its corresponding weights. In addition, each

After we update the model parameters, we can estimate the values of Li(t) by minimizing the 
mean square errors of all genes across time, which is given by

where Φ represents the mean square error generated by the model, and Em(t) is the square 
error generated by node m in the output layer at time t. Subsequently, in each iteration, the 
updated parameters are used to fit the activation levels of the genes at time t + 1. The fitting 
process will loop back to the first time point when t reaches the maximum available time 
point tmax in the time-course microarray data. An early stopping criterion based on the mean 
square errors of all genes across time is suggested. We continue the fitting process until the 
mean square errors is lesser than e.g. 0.001 or until the number of loops reaches 100 epochs. 
 
Interpretation of the Tuned Parameters 
For the tuned parameters, a new objective is to extract the prediction information embedded 
inside the model. We use a product of the weights to infer the type of interaction and the link 
strength between a given pair of genes. For example, if we consider the interaction between 
genes i and j, we can determine the properties of the interaction by 
   , , ,a ti j i m i m m j

where  denotes the strength of the interaction, and the sign of ,i j ,i j  is an indication of 
the type of interaction. There are two types of genetic interactions, the activation-target (AT) 
interaction and the repressor-target (RT) interaction. AT interactions will result in positive 
values of , while for RT interactions ,i j ,i j  will result in negative values. In order to 
distinguish significant links from whole-genome predictions, we may screen out insignificant

Prediction of Genetic Interactions in Yeast 
Transcriptional regulators (TRs) that activate the transcriptions of DNAs are usually 
composed of a DNA-binding site and an activation domain. Transcription of DNA is initiated 
when transcriptional activator protein is bound to its specific DNA-binding sites. Therefore, 
transcriptional interactions are direct interactions. Because the microarray data retrieved from 
Spellman et al. (1998) was collected to identify the function of cell cycle-related genes, we l 
focused on predicting cell cycle-related transcriptional interactions annotated in the 
YEASTRACT (Teixeira et al., 2006) and TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003) databases. 
YEASTRACT and TRANSFAC databases are accessible on the Internet and offer known 
associations between TFs and genes with biological evidences and/or literature support. We 
collected 118 and 64 transcriptional interactions from YEASTRACT and TRANSFAC 
databases, respectively, to form a posteriori knowledge data set to benchmark the proposed 
model. Besides the interactions collected from the databases, we also collected 109 
transcriptional interactions by surveying published literature. The literature that we selected is 
related to the regulation of Cln-Cdc28 kinase. Cln-Cdc28 kinase is important because 
cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 is associated with the Cln3 cyclin and seems to be the most 
upstream activator (Cln3-Cdc28 complex) of two distinct sets of transcriptional complexes, 
SBF and MBF. Therefore, cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 may play an important role in the 
control of the cell cycle progression in buddy yeast (Dirick et al. 1995; Futcher, 1996; Levine 
et al., 1996; Stuart and Wittemberg, 1995; Tyres et al., 1993; Alberghnia et al., 1998). Thus, 
the a posteriori knowledge data set is formed by 291 transcriptional interactions from various 
resources, and should be adequate to avoid evaluation bias caused by lack of test data. 
 Gene expressions of 6,116 genes in S. cerevisiae are used to fit the proposed model. First, 
we use the proposed gene activity extraction scheme to compute the activation levels of all 
genes across time. To obtain the gene activity, we need to set up two parameters, the mRNA 
self-degradation rate (λ) and the transcription rate of the gene (S mRNA/hour). To model the 
transcription, most previous studies assume that the production rate of new mRNA is a 
constant, which is approximately the same for all genes in the cell. However, to obtain more 
accurate information, parameters λ and S of each gene should be measured individually. 
Hence, we conducted a series of RNAi experiments to measure the mRNA production and 
degradation rates of each gene. By conducting the RNAi experiments, the mRNA production 
and degradation rates 4,817 and 5,119 genes are measured. Thus, in this study, we focus on 
4,817 genes in S. cerevisiae which have both λ and S available from the RNAi experiments. 
The complete list of production and degradation rates of all genes is unpublished data and 
cannot be released or appear directly in this paper. If the complete list has not yet been made

regulator of the exit from mitosis (Chaves and Blobel, 2001). SPO12 and DBF2 are both 
reported to be related to the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle in buddy yeast (Toyn and 
Johnston, 1993; Toyn and Johnston, 1994). Extra copies of SPO12 can suppress DBF2, and 
the acquisition of an extra chromosome VIII, which carries the SPO12 locus, will also 
suppress DBF2 (Toyn and Johnston, 1993). SPO12 was reported to be involved in the 
activation and release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus during early anaphase (Asakawa and 
Toh-e, 2002; Stegmeier et al., 2002; Stegmeier et al., 2004). In the predicted network, MCM1 
is predicted to be a suppressor of STE6, and STE6 is predicted to be a suppressor of STE12. 
Thus, we can interpret these interactions as an indication that MCM1 being an indirect 
positive regulator of STE12. In Bruhn Sprague (1994), MCM1 is reported to mediate the 
interaction with both alpha-1 and STE12 for cell-type-specific gene regulation and DNA 
binding. 
The predictions using the alpha and elu data sets were compared with independently 
published data as mentioned above. There was good agreement between the published and 
the predicted genetic interaction, which reinforces the possibility of applying the proposed 
model to predict pathways of the biological processes. 
For the purpose of comparing the proposed model with existing methods, a lagged 
Pearson correlation (Schmitt et al., 2004), an empirical Bayesian-based Gaussian graph 
model (Schäfer and Strimmer, 2005), and a pattern recognition approach (Chuang et al., 2008) 
were applied to infer the interactions in the a posteriori knowledge data set. The model 
formulations of the lagged Pearson correlation (LPC), the empirical Bayesian approach-based 
Gaussian graph models (EB-GMMs), and the pattern recognition approach (PARE) are based 
on the log-ratio of the gene expression levels. We retrieved the normalized gene expression 
data of alpha and elu data sets from Spellman et al. (1998), and applied LPC, EB-GMMs, 
and PARE to infer genetic interactions. For the alpha data set, the true positive rates yielded 
by LPC, EB-GMMs, and PARE are 48%, 52%, and 68%, respectively. For the elu data set, 
the true positive rates yielded by LPC, EB-GMMs, and PARE are 51%, 54%, 66%, 
respectively. The results show that the performance of the proposed model is better than that 
of the other three algorithms. The evaluated results are summarized in Table 1 for 
comparison.

Amplification Kit (Agilent). Next, cRNA was hybridized onto human whole genome oligo 
microarrays (Agilent), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. A total of 43,931 probe sets 
on the arrays were analyzed. Feature Extraction Software (Agilent) was used to analyze the 
scanned images and to estimate the differential gene expression by calculating the statistical 
confidences. We selected 41,675 probe sets by rank-consistency-filtering using the LOWESS 
method. These probe sets were aligned to 7,526 genes and exons with 8 time points and 3 
replicates based on genomic coordinates provided for each probe set from the Agilent 
microarray specification. The visualization of the CFES-treated WI-38 cell microarray data 
can be obtained by subtracting the first time point of each gene from the following ones, as 
shown in Figure 9. 
 
Prediction of Interactions in Human Disease Pathways 
 By surveying previous published studies, we suggest the readers to set S to the average 
production rate of all genes, 10 (mRNA/hour), and λ to the average degradation rate of all 
genes, 120 (Chen et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2003). Then, we applied the proposed model to fit 
the microarray data, and 181,797 out of 56,640,676 possible links were predicted to be 
significant interactions. There are fourteen human cancer pathways in the KEGG DISEASE 
database (Kanehisa et al., 2006). We checked the predictions against the disease pathways 
annotated in the KEGG database. We found that the prediction results yielded by the 
proposed model were highly consistent with the pathways of small cell lung cancer, 
non-small cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and cell adhesion molecular disorder. 
The matching results of the predicted and annotated interactions in each disease pathway are 
summarized in Table 2.  
 Several long-term clinical studies have shown that a large percentage of MTB patients 
show evidence of permanent obstruction or restrictive impairment of lung function (Willcox 
and Ferguson, 1989; Krishna et al., 1977; and Vargha, 1983). For MTB patients who had 
damaged lung function, the risk of triggering the development of lung cancer is more than 
twice that of people with healthy lung (Sin et al., 2004; Man et al., 2003). By reviewing the 
medical records of patients with coexisting MTB and lung cancer, it has been reported that 
the incidence of lung cancer is significantly higher in MTB patients (Chen et al., 1996). 
Recent reports have shown that CFES protein released from MTB can have directly influence 
susceptibility to lung immune system (Abramo et al.,2006; Meher et al., 2007). Furthermore, 
fibroblasts play an essential role in modulating inflammatory response to MTB infection 
(O'Kane et al., 2007). It has been reported that inflammatory response-altering interleukin 1 
(IL1) gene variations may raise the risk to develop lung cancer (Engels et al., 2007). Thus, 
18 
al., 2002; Al-Anazi et al., 2007), and then cause fatality. These clinical studies further support 
the inference given by the proposed model in the relationship between CFES protein released 
from MTB and AML. 
 Finally, we looked into the association between cell adhesion molecules and MTB. 
There are a total of 11 links were predicted to be positive interactions, and 8 (72.7%) out of 
them were true positives annotated in the KEGG database. The predictions yielded by the 
proposed model can be interpreted as the fact that CFES protein released from MTB causing 
inflammatory response in lung, and these reactions are a part of the pathway regulated by cell 
adhesion molecules. Many studies have indicated the importance of cell adhesion molecules 
in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory lung diseases (Mukae et al., 2003), which 
includes inflammatory and immune responses caused by MTB infection. In Lai et al. (1993), 
it has been reported that cell adhesion molecules may be involved in the pathogenesis of 
MTB, and that some adhesion molecules could be used as markers to diagnose the disease 
activity. Thus, the clinical evidence mentioned above further supports the inferences yielded 
by the proposed model that cell adhesion molecules play a role in inflammatory and immune 
responses against CFES protein released from infectious MTB. 
 The consistencies between prediction and known human disease pathways reinforce the 
possibility of using the proposed model to predict pathways of complex human diseases. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The proposed nonlinear model first calculates the activation levels of genes using a nonlinear 
correlation estimator and the gene activity extraction scheme. Next, it uses a recurrent 
network to model the mechanism of gene regulation. After the nonlinear fitting process, the 
parameters of the tuned network can be used to predict the functional linkage between genes. 
The proposed model was applied to microarray data sets in S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens. For 
S. cerevisiae, the proposed model was applied to alpha and elu date sets in Spellman et al. 
(1998). The true positive rates of the proposed model were 71.8% to 73.9% in the alpha and 
elu data set, respectively. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated and 
compared with the lagged Pearson correlation, Bayesian-based Gaussian graph model, and 
the pattern recognition using the same microarray data sets. The results showed that the 
proposed model outperformed the other three algorithms. Furthermore, many predicted 
interactions were shown to agree with known interactions. These consistencies indicate that 
the proposed model has the potential to predict genetic interactions. 
 Furthermore, the proposed model was applied to time-course gene expression data of 
CFES-treated human diploid fibroblasts (WI-38) cells. By matching the predicted interactions
