技術說明 英文： Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is an innovative 
technology to the degradation organic solvent in aqueous solution.
The propylene glycol mono-methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) is used 
widely as cleaning solvent by electronic wafer manufacture plant.  A 
200mL Inconel-625 SCWO reactor with continuous flow of 
supercritical water was used in this study.  The Destruction removing 
efficiency (DRE) of PGMEA depended upon both reactor’s 
temperature and concentration of PGMEA.  DRE of PGMEA was 
evaluated as reaction temperature raise above the auto ignition 
temperature (AIT) 354℃ of PGMEA, the DRE of TOC and COD was 
>98%.  The SCWO of PGMEA technology presently used in our lab, 
optimum concentration for PGMEA degradation is 2.67~8.0% (v/v).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
A continuous flow SCWO system is shown in Figure 1.  PGMEA is mixed with water to simulate the waste and the 
PGMEA concentration in reactor ranges from 2.67 to 13.33%.  The removal of total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) are used to evaluate the DRE of PGMEA.  The PGMEA is then pressurized and flows into the 
flow system by ISCO pump.  The waste feeding stream is cooled by water before entering the reactor to prevent plugging 
due to the potential precipitation of inorganic salt and metal oxides in the wastes and the formation of various tars in 
reactor tube.  The pre-heated water is pressurized and fed into the reactor by a diaphragm pump.  Compressed air supplied 
from a10 hp air cylinder (10~90mL/min) is pressurized by a booster (AGT 14/62, 17~42mL/min).  A constant system 
pressure in the reactor was maintained at 23~27MPa through this experiment and sufficient air is used as the oxidant in 
this work.  The pre-heated water, air and PGMEA are mixed in reactor, which is made of Inconel-625 with internal volume 
of 200mL in which submerged in a furnace.  The reaction temperature mainly between 200 to 460℃ was applied to the 
reactor.  The treated solution effused from the reactor is cooled and flows into a gas-liquid separator (GLS) where the 
mixture of carbon dioxide generated in the process and the residue of the excess air is separated from the liquid effluent.  A 
control valve (CV) installed on the gas effluent at the top of the separator regulates the pressure of the system, and a needle 
valve connected at the bottom of the separator constantly discharges the liquid effluent to maintain the liquid level in the 
separator.   The process water leaving the reactor after SCWO was collected and characterized by its pH value, and 
percent DRE based on TOC (Apollo 9000 TOC combustion analyzer) and COD (dichromate oxidation method) 
measurement of treated water.  The DRE of PGMEA is then calculated as (TOCi－TOCf)/ TOCi × 100%.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The initial TOC, COD, and pH of the PGMEA solution with five different levels of concentration are shown in Table 1.   
The destruction removing efficiency of PGMEA solution by SCWO with five different concentrations and ten levels of 
temperature are summarized in Figure 2 and 3.  The reproducibility of SCWO data was evaluated by the percent relative 
standard deviation (%RSD) and the RSD of these data is typically ±2.5%.  It is known that temperature, pressure, and 
sufficient amount of air supply are the most important parameters in SCWO and they have both theoretical and practical 
implications for the PGMEA destruction process.  The experimental results showed that the decomposition efficiency 
steeply improve under supercritical condition.  For example, at sub critical (i.e., 300℃) condition, a 5.33% PGMEA 
solution with 81% TOC removal while >96% TOC removal was obtained at supercritical temperature of 380℃.  As the 
temperature increases to 460℃, more than 99% TOC removal was observed.  At the sub-critical temperature such as

4 CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this preliminary work, the treatment of wastewater containing PGMEA by SCWO is found feasible.  The concentration 
of PGMEA from 2.67~13.33% is prepared for simulated wastewater and the experiments are conducted in a continuous 
supercritical water flow system.  Reaction temperature at the sub and supercritical conditions were used in this study.  
Reactor’s pressure was controlled at 23~27MPa with overwhelming excess air pumped into the system.  Our studies 
showed that PGMEA had the best DRE of TOC and COD at the concentrations of PGMEA of 2.67%~8.0%.  After auto

treatment.  In this work, a preliminary study was done for water contains high concentration of 
acetone.  The acetone was destructed by SCWO in a continuous flow system with a tube reactor.  
The effects of temperature and pressure on the destruction removing efficiency were 
investigated.  The experimental results indicated that the obtained reaction parameters in 
supercritical water may provide useful information to scale up design for treating of spent 
acetone in water. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
A continuous flow SCWO system is shown in Figure 1.  The equipment was designed and 
assembled by Asia Giant cooperation in Taiwan.  Acetone is mixed with water to simulate the 
waste and the acetone concentration in reactor ranges from 4 to 15%.  The removal of chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) are used to evaluate the DRE of acetone.  
The acetone is then pressurized and flows into the flow system by pump P1.  The wasted 
feeding stream is cooled by water before entering the reactor to prevent plugging due to the 
potential precipitation of inorganic salt and metal oxides in the wastes and the formation of 
various tars in reactor tube.  The pre-heated water is pressurized and fed into the reactor by 
pump P2.  Compressed air supplied from a10 hp air cylinder (10~90mL/min) is pressurized by 
a booster P3 (AGT 14/62, 17~42mL/min).  A constant system pressure in the reactor was 
maintained at 23~27MPa through this experiment and sufficient air is used as the oxidant in this 
work.  The pre-heated water, air and acetone are mixed in reactor, which is made of Inconel-625 
with internal volume of 200mL in which submerged in a furnace.  The reaction temperature 
mainly between 350 to 480 was applied to the reactor.  The treated solution effused from the 
reactor is cooled and flows into a gas-liquid separator T1 where the mixture of carbon dioxide 
generated in the process and the residue of the excess air is separated from the liquid effluent.  A 
control valve installed on the gas effluent at the top of the separator regulates the pressure of the 
system, and a needle valve connected at the bottom of the separator constantly discharges the 
liquid effluent to maintain the liquid level in the separator.   The process water leaving the 
reactor after SCWO was collected and characterized by its pH value, and percent DRE based on 
TOC (Apollo 9000 TOC combustion analyzer) and COD (dichromate oxidation method) 
measurement of treated water.  The DRE of acetone is then calculated as (COD CODf)/
