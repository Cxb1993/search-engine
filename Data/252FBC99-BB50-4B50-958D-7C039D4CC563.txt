Introduction 
In aquatic environment such as shallow lakes, can stratify and destratify in a day, 
and may even remain persistently stratified over a couple days. The entire water 
column in a shallow lake can behave as a diurnal mixed layer. The diurnal physical 
dynamics and the dynamics of phytoplankton (Ganf, 1974), dissolved oxygen (Branco, 
2007; Branco and Torgersen, 2009), phosphorus (Havens et al., 2007), water color 
(Persson and Jones, 2008), methane (Ford et al., 2002), and other bigeochemical 
processes has been investigated.   
Flows in the lakes are driven in most cases by shear stresses resulted from wind 
and freshwater inflow. The effect of wind-induced current has been studies through 
field observations, laboratory small-scale physical models, and numerical models to 
evaluate the impacts on hydraulic structures, mixing, and stratification. 
Typhoon-induced inflow, especially in Taiwan, is an important factor to affect the 
mixing in the water column.    
Vertical mixing by turbulence in the mixed layer and circulation due to 
meteorological conditions has been numerically studied using one-dimensional 
mixed-layer and two-dimensional, three-dimensional circulations models. Most of the 
existing numerical models are based on solving the shallow water equations, together 
with diffusion equations for the transport and dispersion of constituents and pollutants. 
In one-dimensional model, simulations are implemented on the basis of the 
assumption that the vertical scale of heat and momentum is locally much greater than 
the horizontal scale. Han et al. (2000) applied one-dimensional DYRESM to simulate 
reservoir hydrodynamics in Sau Reservoir. They found that the inflow with high 
temperature was the main factor controlling the thermal structure in the reservoir and 
demonstrated that the effect of residence time on thermal stratification was manifested 
mainly by the changes in the depth of thermocline. Herb and Stefan (2005) used a 
one-dimensional model to simulate vertical mixing in the mixed layer and the effects 
of macrophytes on vertical mixing and thermal stratification in Otter Lake, USA. 
Their simulated results revealed that macrophytes enhances thermal stratification in 
 6
unstratified season. Lee et al. (2009) adopted a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic 
circulation model to study the thermal structure, its evolution and water circulation of 
Yachiyo Lake, Japan. The numerical experiments found that the importance of mixing 
in the stratified lake is due to the velocity shear between the thin surface layer, and the 
mid-layer and internal waves. The internal gravity waves below the thin surface 
sometimes cause large displacement of isotherms, up to 2m, in direct response to 
wind stress.  
In the present study, a real-time three-dimensional hydrodynamic model is 
adopted to simulate water temperature and circulation in the stratified lake. Model 
simulation was validated against water level, time-series water temperature and 
vertical profiles of water temperature in 2008. The validated model was then applied 
to investigate the wind-driven current and mean circulation in the Yuan-Yang Lake 
(YYL). The lake’s residence time was also calculated and discussed using the 
validated model.  
 
Description of Study Site 
Yuan-Yang Lake (YYL) is in the northeastern region of Taiwan (24°35’N, 
121°24’E) (Figure 1a). YYL is a small (3.6 ha), shallow (4.5 m maximum depth) lake 
in a mountainous catchment 1,730 m above sea level. Figure 1b shows the bathymetry 
of YYL. The lake and surrounding catchment (374 ha) were designated as a long-term 
ecological study site by the Taiwan National Science Council in 1992 and joined the 
Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) in 2004. The steep 
watersheds are dominated by pristine Taiwan false cypress [Chamaecyparis obtusa 
Sieb. & Zucc. var. formosana (Hayata) Rehder] forest. YYL is slightly stained, with 
an average DOC concentration of 6.1 mg L-1 and mean pH of 5.9. The average annual 
temperature is approximately 13oC ( monthly average ranges from -5 to 15oC) and the 
annual precipitation is more than 4,000 mm. YYL is subject to three to seven 
typhoons in summer and autumn each year, during which more than 1,700 mm of 
precipitation may fall on the lake.

Numerical approximation  
SELFE model is based on a finite-element scheme. Unlike most 
three-dimensional models, no mode splitting is allowed. Semi-implicit schemes are 
applied to all equations to enhance stability and to maximize efficiency. An 
Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM) is used to treat the advection, thus allowing large 
time step to be used without compromising stability. The entire domain is discretized 
in the horizontal and vertical directions. Unstructured triangular grids are used in the 
horizontal direction.  
In the vertical, models based on terrain-following coordinated suffer, to some 
degree, from the hydrostatic inconsistencies. This follows from the fact that 
terrain-following coordinates do not conform to the geo-potential, and the pressure 
gradient is evaluated as the difference between two large components that tend to 
cancel each other, thus being to large discretization errors. It can also be viewed as 
result of evaluating pressure at a grid point efficiently using extrapolation when steep 
bathymetric slopes are presented (Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2003). Many 
remedies have been used to prevent this, including evaluating the gradient in the 
 10
the time-series inflow and outflow discharges. It reveals that the peak discharge 
occurred on 6th September due to the typhoon event. The observed water surface 
elevations in the YYL from 14th August to 10th September, 2008 were used to 
compare with model predictions shown in Figure 2b.  
Good model performance is indicated by the calculated absolute mean error 
(AME) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) statistic values (e.g., Thomann, 1982). 
AME is the average of the absolute values of differences between observed data and 
simulated values. RMSE basically specifies the overall difference in the sum of 
squares normalized to the number of observations. Both AME and RMSE provide an 
indication of the magnitude of the model’s prediction uncertainty for a type data point. 
RMSE is similar to a standard error of the mean for the model’s uncertainty. The 
AME and RMSE between computed and observed water surface elevation are 0.65 
cm and 0.79 cm, respectively. It reveals that the simulated results mimic the observed 
water surface elevations.  
Figure 3 presents the comparison of model simulated and measured velocity 
profiles at the buoy station on 16th September, 2008. It shows that the return current 
occurred in the velocity profiles at u and v components. The simulated results closely 
match the measured velocity profiles and indicate that the model has the capability to 
predict the current patterns in the lake.   
Water Temperature 
To validate the water temperature, the time-series data collected from May to 
June and July to September, 2008 was used to compare with simulated results. Figure 
4 shows an example of time series of these atmospheric variables from May to June. 
The winds were generally small (average speed was 0.29 m/s) and the predominant 
wind direction was from southwest. The major wind event (maximum speed was 2.02 
m/s) occurred on 25th May. Heat and momentum fluxes were estimated from these 
meteorological variables to provide the surface boundary conditions of the model.  
Figure 5a presents the comparison of model predicted and measured water 
temperature in the YYL from 1st May to 30th June, 2008. The figure shows the water 
 12
protection, water supply and ecosystem, is primarily caused by wind shear acting on 
the surface, and is affected partly by density gradients, aquatic plants, and other 
factors. Therefore, circulation in the YYL is complicated, and we are far from having 
solved all of the problems with simulating it. In the present research, wind is 
considered to be the major factor causing circulation in the YYL because the 
wind-induced current significantly affects water quality and ecosystem in the 
closed-water area.  
From the present simulations examples of snap shots of water temperature and 
flow field at surface layer, 1m, 2m and 3m below water surface are presented at two 
different days on 21st June and 19th June, 2008 (Figures 7 and 8). Wind speed and 
direction at these two days are quite different to present the flow patterns. On 21st 
June the winds were small (0.415 m/s) and blowing from the southwest (Figure 7). 
The surface temperature at shallow area was higher than that at deep region and 
exhibited 40C difference. There was 4.50C difference between the surface and bottom 
layers at the deep area. The velocity field along the wind axis showed some variations 
over depth with return current where the velocity at the surface layer was along the 
wind direction while it was opposite near 1m below water surface. The surface 
velocity at deep region was 0.3 to 0.7 cm/s. Rao et al. (2009) used three-dimensional 
hydrodynamic modeling system (ELCOM) to study the circulation and thermal 
structure in the lake and harbour. They reported the phenomena of return current in 
the Lake Ontario which is similar with our simulated results.  
On 19th June the winds were stronger (1.50 m/s) and blowing from the northern 
(Figure 8). The surface temperature between shallow and deep regions was 30C. The 
temperature difference between surface and bottom layers at deep region was 3.10C. 
The stronger wind made the water temperature more mixing in vertical direction. It is 
clearly seen that a strong return flow was generated between the surface layer and 1m 
below surface layer. The surface velocity at the deep region was in the range of 3.4 
and 7.5 cm/s which was higher than that during small winds shown in Figure 7.  
Mean circulation

field within the water body, and its decline over time reflects the net rate at which 
tracer leaves the water body. The rate of mass loss as a function of time ( )r t

where t  is time and rT  is the mean residence time. 
One issue remains in the application of Eq. (7) is the upper limit of the 
integration. Theoretically, the integration should be processes to the time when the 
residual mass reaches zero. In most circumstances, it may take infinitely long time. In 
this study, we adopt 1% of residual mass is designed to be the upper limit of the 
integration in Eq. (7).  
The validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to calculate the 
residence time in response to different inflow discharges with and without wind 
effects in the YYL. Tracer concentration of 10 was occupied in the lake and then the 
model was run with different discharges from inflow boundaries. To investigate the 
wind effects on the residence time, the model was forced with northeast wind, 
southwest wind, and without wind stress. The wind speed was specified with 1.4 m/s 
when wind stress was included.  
Figure 10 plots the residence time vs. the inflow discharge with and without 
wind effects. In all three scenario runs, data obtained from hydrodynamic model 
simulations indicate that residence time reduce in response to inflows in a similar 
pattern. Least-square regression analysis was conducted. Empirical best-fitting 
equations were obtained in forms of power law. The power-law empirical equations fit 
well with the residence time resulted from the hydrodynamic model simulations, with 
correlation R2 values above 0.97. Empirical regression equations of residence time

during the normal condition.  
The validated model was used to probe the circulation patterns in the YYL. Wind 
speed and direction are the dominant factors to drive the current patterns. The 
simulated results reveal that the velocity field along the wind axis show some 
variations over depth with return current where the velocity at the surface layer is 
along the wind direction while it is opposite near 1m below water surface. The 
stronger wind would make the water temperature more mixing in vertical direction. 
The simulated mean current show that the surface currents flow towards the southwest 
direction and form a clock-wise rotation.  
The validated model was also used to calculate the mean residence time in 
response to different inflows with and without wind effects. Regression analysis of 
model results reveals that an exponential equation can be used to correlate the 
residence time to change of inflow discharges. The calculated system residence time 
is strongly dependent on the inflows. The residence time decreases as the inflow 
discharge increases. The residence time without wind stress is higher than that with 
wind effect, indicating that wind plays an important role in lake mixing. The 
simulated results reveal that residence time is approximately 2~2.5 days under low 
inflow with wind effect. Because the residence time is an important indicator for lake 
water quality and ecosystem assessments, results from this study are helpful for 
environmental management of the YYL.
