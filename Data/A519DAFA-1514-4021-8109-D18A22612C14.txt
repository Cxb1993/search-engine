the use of the proposed control scheme.  Finally, brief 
conclusions are drawn in section 4.

where K  is the gain, T is a time constant and 
( ) 3rrrH ϕβϕαϕ &&& +=  (α  and β  are constants) is a 
nonlinear function in rϕ&  determined experimentally from 
the standard spiral test.  The original nonlinear system can 
be piecewisely linearized under some cruise conditions.  
In this research, the nominal cruise speed is set to be 20 
knots.  The nominal rudder angle, heading angle and the 
change rate of heading angle are set to be zero degree in 
this simulation.  Furthermore, for a more complete 
description of the ship model, the rudder servomechanism 
has to be taken into account.  For instance, a natural 
constraint of the steering machine is given by 
maxmax δδδ ≤≤− , (19) 
where 35max =δ  (degree) is the maximum rudder 
angle.

In general, the environmental disturbance of the ship 
steering should be considered, especially the wave, which 
can affect the yaw angle of ship heading.  For simplicity 
of illustration, the disturbance ( )tf  in (1b) is generated 
by  
( ) ( )sshsf ω)(= , (20) 
where ( )⋅ω  is a zero-mean Gaussian white noise and the 
transfer function ( )sh  is given by

In (19), ζ  is the damping coefficient, 0ω  is the 
dominating wave frequency, and ωω δζω02=K  is the 
gain constant with ωδ  representing the wave intensity 
[6].  We then take ( )tF  in (3) as ( ) ( )tftF = . 
The conventional maneuvering problems can be 
classified into four types, namely course keeping handling, 
course changing handling, course tracking handling, and 
special motion handling (for instance, marine search 
handling, rescue handling).  In this section, the handling 
problems of course keeping, course changing, and course 
tracking, will be investigated by using the proposed PI 
controller.  The related parameter are given as 
aiN =0.0206, bN =0.0022, 093.0=K , 7.8=T , 
9.42α = , 2.24β = , 0 1.0ω = , 0.1ζ = , 
2 10ωδ = , 188.01 =w , 10=PK , 11 wKc P += , and 
15=IK .  The proportional-gain PK  and integral-gain 
IK  are chosen by the designer.  In our experiment, the 
larger proportional-gain will produce slower response but 
smaller over-shoot, whereas the larger integral-gain will 
produce faster response but larger over-shoot. 
In the first simulation, the course keeping problem is 
considered.  The main goal of course keeping handling is 
to keep the heading angle of vessel on the fixed direction.  
The desired output is set to be twenty degree.  The output 
responses by using the proposed controller (solid line) and 
by using traditional variable structure controller (dotted 
line) are shown in Figure 2.  From Figure 2, the rise time 
and overshoot of the output response by using the 
proposed controller is reasonably well as compared with 
that by using the traditional variable structure controller.   
The course changing handling usually occurs in the 
collision avoidance problems.  For course changing, 
autopilot control may require large heading angle change 
and the heading angle of the vessel must turn to the desired 
direction as soon as possible.  In the next simulation of 
course changing, the vessel is required to track a sequence 
of step functions of heights 20, 0 and 20, respectively, in 
every 50 second.  The simulation results are shown in 
Figure 3. It is apparent that the performance of the 
proposed controller is quite good.   
The problem of ship maneuvering in restricted water, 
such as harbors, canals, river inlets, etc., is of major 
concern from the viewpoint of marine safety.  It is very 
important for a shipmaster to make a ship-handling plan 
before approaching such maritime space just mentioned.  
The vessel must navigate in the desired course precisely 
for safety.  This is one form of the course tracking 
problems. In the final simulation of course tracking 
handling, the desired heading angle dϕ  is ( )1801.0sin5 tπ .  The simulation results are shown in 
Figure 4. It is obvious that the desired angle and the actual 
angle responses are almost identical. 
The output performance is slightly difference due to 
chosen differ parameters of PK  and IK  shown as 
Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively.  In this paper, the 
parameters are chosen depended on experience of designer.  
Some advance learning algorithm, i.e., genetic algorithm 
might be useful in parameter tuning.  This point requires 
further research and development.
