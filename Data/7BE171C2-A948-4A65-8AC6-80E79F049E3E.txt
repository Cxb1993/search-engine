  The LMI (2) is a convex constraint on x , i.e., the set 
}0  )( | { ;xFx is convex. The LMI can represent a wide variety 
of convex constraints on x, e.g., linear inequalities, certain 
forms of quadratic inequalities, matrix norm inequalities, 
constraints arising in control theory, such as Lyapunov and 
convex quadratic matrix inequalities. Many conditions can be 
cast in the form of LMI. 
 
III. Semidefinite Programming 
 
We consider the optimization problem of minimizing a linear 
function of variable subject to an LMI: mx ℜ∈
0  )(      subject to
     min             
;xF
xcT                    (3) 
where is a constant vector in and is defined as in 
(1). Then we call the optimization problem (3) a semidefinite 
program (SDP). A semidefinite program is a conver 
optimization problem since the objective and constraints are 
convex: if 
c nℜ )(xF
0  )( ;xF and 0  )( ;yF , then, for allλ , ,10 ≤≤ λ  
  0.  )()1()())1(( ;yFxFyxF λλλλ −+=−+  
There are many similarities between semidefinite programs 
and linear programs both in theory and practice, e.g., in 
duality theory, the role of complementary slackness, and 
availability of efficient solution techniques using interior-point 
methods. Foe instance, consider the following linear program 
(LP): 
   
,0      subject to
     min             
≥+ bAx
xcT
in which the inequality denotes a componentwise inequality.  
A vector is nonnegative, , if and only if the matrix 
 is positive semidefinite 
v 0≥v
)(vdiag 0  )( ;vdiag . Therefore, we 
can express the LP as a semidefinite program with the linear 
matrix inequality , i.e., )()( bAxxF += diag

The above optimization problem with Lyapunov descent 
criterion can be solve by Kuhn-Tucker Theorem, see Wang 
and Mukai [32].  
We now apply SDP to the above optimization problem (23). 
Since P > 0 , we can find P  such that P P= P .  
Therefore,V ( )ξ can be put in the format of (6).  But Q may 
not be positive definite, and thus we may not be able to 
decompose Q into its square roots. 
Note that the optimization problem (23) is exactly in the 
formulation of QCQP as in (5) and (6), except the inequality 
constraint.  We now attempt to rewrite the above 
optimization problem in the QCQP format (5) and (6)
