英文摘要 
    Considering the RF circuit technologies, 
the microstrip line is a popular method because 
its architecture is simple, low cost, and easy to 
fabricate in the print circuit method. Therefore, 
we choose the microstrip line to design a 
dual-frequency bandpass filters and the purpose 
of this thesis is to improve the microwave 
characteristics of filters. The design of the 
bandpass filters is based on the coupling theory 
of the parallel-coupled microstrip line structure, 
and the methods of enhancing the second 
passband response are proposed. In this paper, 
Al2O3 ceramic (dielectric constant εr=9.8) is 
used as the substrates to fabricate the designed 
dual-band filters, the optimum simulated 
insertion loss of designed filter is −1.75 dB at 
2.41 GHz and −2.537 dB at 5.08 GHz, however, 
the optimum measured insertion loss of  the 
fabricated filter is −3.538 dB at 2.45 GHz and 
−2.619 dB at 5.2 GHz, respectively. 
 
1. Introduction 
Microstrip filters had been found wide 
applications in microwave circuits and systems, 
and this was particularly driven by rapidly 
growing wireless communications. Recently, 
that the radio frequency (RF) transceivers 
operating in multiple separated frequency bands 
was an important demand of wireless 
communication applications. For the global 
system mobility (GSM) and code division 
multiple access (CDMA) mobile phone, the RF 
transceiver were able to receive and transmit the 
900 and 1900MHz signals. However, the WLAN 
operated at 2.4 and 5.2GHz bands, and GPS 
operates at 1.57GHz, respectively, filters played 
important roles in all these communication 
system.  
Dual-band microstrip filter was initially 
reported by Miyake et al. [1], which cascading 
the two individual filters with two specified 
single passbands directly. Wu and Razavi [2] 
designed the RF front-end by switching between 
two separated 900MHz and 1800MHz RF 
front-end circuits. Quendo and Tsai et al. [3, 4] 
used the basic topology of a stopband filter, and 
a uniform transmission line to enforce the 
emergence of dual passbands relying on multiple 
rejection, changed from −26.17dB to −27.82dB, 
has no apparent variation as the size of slot 
increases. However, the out-of-band rejection 
out-of the two passbands also has no apparent 
change. Figure 6 shows the variations of 
insertion loss at both passbands as a function of 
slot y. The insertion loss (S21) at both 
frequencies increases as the interval increases. 
The insertion loss of the first passband changes 
from −2.642 dB to −3.09 dB and changes 
slightly from −1.584 dB to −1.812 dB for the 
second passband. 
Table Ш shown the inferences of the filters 
due to the variation of the saw-tooth z, and the 
results are redrawing in Fig. 7. As the size of the 
saw-tooth increases from 0.1mm to 0.4mm, the 
first passband shifts from 2.46GHz to 2.41GHz 
and the second passband shifts from 5.18GHz to 
5.08GHz, respectively. The out-of-band 
rejection, changed from −25.96dB to −24.84dB, 
has no apparent variation as the size of slot 
increases. However, the out-of-band rejection 
out-of the two passbands also has no apparent 
change. Figure 8 shows the variations of 
insertion loss at both passbands as a function of 
the saw-tooth z. The insertion loss (S21) at both 
frequencies increases as the interval increases. 
The insertion loss at first passband changes from 
−2.533dB to −1.75dB and The insertion loss at 
second passband changes from −1.572dB to 
−2.537dB. 
According to the results of simulation, the 
filter with better characteristics could be 
fabricated, Fig. 9 shows the photographs of the 
fabricated filter. Figure 10 shows the 
comparison between the simulated and 
measured results of the fabricated filter, the 
measured result is matched to the simulated one. 
In this paper, the optimum simulation insertion 
loss is -1.75dB at 2.41GHz and −2.537dB at 
5.08GHz, however, the optimum measured 
insertion loss is −3.538dB at 2.45GHz and 
−2.619dB at 5.2GHz, respectively. The 
difference between the measured results and 
simulated results both are smaller than 1dB, and 
it is acceptable for the application in microwave 
communication. Finally, the frequency (2.4GHz, 
5.2GHz) and loss are tunable by using the 
variation of geometric structures (interval, slot, 
and saw-tooth). 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, dual-mode parallel-coupled 
ceramic filters (2.4GHz, 5.2GHz) are 
investigated. This ceramic filter could be applied 
to present communication components, it is low 
cost, easy to fabricate, and the structure is very 
simple. Comparing to the filters which use the 
FR4 substrate, there are the following 
advantages by using Al2O3 ceramic as the 
substrate: 
1. Due to the large dielectric constant, a filter 
with the small size of 24mm x 65mm can be 
obtained. 
2. The optimum insertion loss of this filter is 
−3.538dB at 2.45GHz, −2.619dB at 5.2GHz, 
respectively. 
3. Because of the high-quality factor, the wave 
is more precipitous and the loss is small. 
4. The out-of-band rejection between two 
passbands is over −25dB. 
5. The second harmonic frequency is enhanced 
and modified to an acceptable condition in 
this research.

In this paper, a wide-band ceramic T-shaped microstrip antenna 
(2.45 GHz) is investigated. Because the dielectric constant of Al2O3 
substrate (εr= 9.8) is larger than FR4 substrate (εr= 4.4), therefore the size 
of filter is small. This ceramic antenna can be applied to present 
communication components, it is low cost, easy to fabricate, and the 
structure is simple. Comparing to the other monopole antenna, there are
