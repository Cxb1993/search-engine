The bipolar plate is a significant part of the PEMFC and DMFC stacks, which weight share is 
about 78.67% and cost share is about 45% for a PEMFC stack [3].  In a typical PEM or DMFC 
fuel cell, the main functions of bipolar plates include carrying current away from the cell, 
distributing the fuel and oxidant within the cell, facilitating water and thermal management, and 
separating individual cells in the stack. The material criterions for bipolar plate are suggested to 
have high electrical and thermal conductivities, good corrosion resistance, sufficient compressive 
strength, and low density. Therefore, the materials can be broadly classified as non-metal 
(non-porous graphite/electro-graphite), metals (non-coated and coated), and Composites 
(polymer-carbon and polymer metal) [4]. 
Printed circuit board is a novel technology for fuel cell stack, which is first presented 
suggested by O’Hayre et al [5] for portable fuel cell arrays with printed-circuit technology named 
PCBFC. The main advantages of a PCBFC include increasing design flexibility, low costs, higher 
power density, easier integrated to devices because of flat design, and improved packing form 
factors. In the structure of a PCBFC, the anode and cathode board consists of a thin cooper layer 
laminated on a substrate and act as current collector. Each copper plate need to be coated some 
material preventing corrosion and with hole arrays on for reactants in and products out to MEA 
[5-6]. A commercialized PCB-DMFC was appeared by Antig Corp. Figure 1 is a six-cell DMFC 
module (double sided). It is more clearly seen the electric collector is a coated copper plate with 
array holes [7]. Moreover, how to make a good combination of the number and size of holes is 
interesting and important to increase the DMFC performance. In this paper, a systematic study on 
the holes effects is presented by integrating fractal geometry theory. 
 
2. Literature Review 
The theory of fractal geometry was proposed by Mandelbrot [8] and is mathematically 
defined in “Haussdorff dimensions, which are a set of non-integers. The main characteristics of 
fractal pattern are self-similarity, sub-divisibility, and recursive nature. The theory describes 
certain phenomena which are difficult to be described in very fine variation by convectional 
methods such as contour of seashores, the slopes of valleys or patterns of clouds. The fractal 
theory has been applied in many engineering fields: such as tree network for electronic cooling 
application by Bejan and Errera [9], cooling of a circular heated surface by fractal-like branching 
channel networks by Pence [10], fractal generation for heat sink fins by Lee et al. [11], automatic 
surface finishing path by Chen et al. [12].   
Tüber et al. [13] presented a fractal structures as flow-fields in PEMFCs and DMFCs for 
portable applications. They applied “FracTherm” theory, which was originally been generated to 
design structures for heat-exchangers, to generate fractal structures for a DMFC flow field on the 
bipolar plates. A multiple-branched structure with smooth flow path similar to biological fluid 
channels was adopted in their research and compared with serpentine and parallel flow fields. 
Their results showed serpentine flow channel has better cell stability and performance but much 
more pressure drop across the channel. Both multiple-branched fractal and parallel flow field 
could be alternate structures with lower pressure drop with similar performance. Moreover, they

30% for the 2nd order, and the standard one is 29%. The total free open perimeter lengths for 1st 
order, 2nd order, and standard opens are 171.16mm, 503.96mm, and 373.44mm, respectively. The 
current collectors with circle standard open holes and fractal Hilbert Curve carve were designed 
and manufactured as shown in the Figure 6. The related geometric information is listed in Table 3 
and it shows the current collectors with the Hilbert Curve carves opens has much higher values of 
total free open ratio and total free carve perimeter lengths than those with fractal Sierpinski 
Carpet holes. The free open ratio for the 1st order Hilbert Curve carves is 23.5, 49.4% for the 2nd 
order, 50 for the 3rd order, and the standard circle one is 29%. The total free open perimeter 
lengths for 1st order, 2nd order, 3rd order, and the standard one are 266.9mm, 555.65mm, 
1117.82mm, and 614.12mm, respectively. 
Figure 7 is the comparison of the current collectors with circle standard and fractal Sierpinski 
Carpet open holes under a constant anode flow rate of 15cc min-1 and 1000cc min-1 cathode 
airflow rate. The results showed that best performance is the cell with 2nd order fractal circle open 
current collectors, the second one is the cell with standard open holes, and the worst is the cell 
with 1st order opens. Figure 8 is the comparison of the current collectors with rectangle standard 
and fractal Sierpinski Carpet open holes under a constant anode flow rate of 15cc min-1 and 
1000cc min-1 cathode airflow rate.. The results showed the same trends as the fractal Sierpinski 
Carpet open holes: that best performance is the cell with 2nd order fractal rectangle open current 
collectors, the second one is the cell with standard open holes, and the worst is the cell with 1st 
order opens. Table 4 is the performance comparison among the circle standard and fractal Hilbert 
Curve geometry on current collectors at 0.3V at different anode flow rate and Table 5 is the 
performance comparison among the rectangle standard and fractal Hilbert Curve geometry on 
current collectors at 0.3V at different anode flow rate.  
The results showed that the cell is increasing as the anode fuel flow is increasing and became 
stable until the anode fuel supply is sufficient. In both cases, the fractal 3rd order geometry has 
larger total perimeter length than standard and fractal 1st order geometries and presented highest 
performance, even the standard geometry has the largest free open ratio in the circle type cases. 
Compared with the circle and rectangle types, the rectangle one has higher free open ratio as well 
as total open perimeter length at the same order (standard, 1st order, or 2nd order conditions, a 
current collector with the rectangle open shape has higher performance than the one with the 
circle open shape. Based on the above data, it could be found cell performance is stronger 
affected by the total open perimeter length and also relative affected by the total open ratio. Each 
side has 2nd order fractal open shape, which has largest free open ratio and free open perimeter 
length, showed the highest performance than any other case. Another finding in Table 4 and Table 
5 are the cathode side geometric open condition has much more influence for the cell 
performance than the anode side.  
In order to increase the total free open ratio and total free open perimeter length, the fractal 
Hibert curve type is introduced in the research. Figure 9 is the performance comparison of the 
current collector with rectangle standard and fractal Hilbert Curve results under a constant anode 
flow rate of 15cc min-1 and 1000cc min-1 cathode airflow rate. Table 6 listed the performance 
comparison under at 0.3V. The results showed that the cell with the current collectors with the 3rd
