Abstract: 
This study experimentally investigates the heat transfer effects of forced convection and natural convection 
under different substrate openings design. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established and 
implemented to verify and explain the experimental results and heat transfer behavior. It is found that different 
opening position will destroy the growth of the boundary layer on substrates to alter the cooling ability for both 
forced under low Reynolds number and natural convection. Nevertheless, having too many opening may reduce 
heat conduction and affect the overall heat transfer performance. This study provides future researchers with a 
guideline on designing and electronic package manufacturing.

In recent years, several methods have been developed to improve the efficiency in radiative calculation for 
complex geometries. For instance, the employment of the finite volume method (FVM) to simulate radiation [16, 
17] has been successfully applied to several problems with complex geometry [18, 19]. Meanwhile, the discrete 
ordinate (DO) method, which was also extended to body-fitted geometries, has been validated by comparing with 
FVM [20]. In both DO model and FVM, the spatial domain is divided into a finite number of control-volume-based 
CFD approach. Since a simple geometry was considered in this study, the accuracy of the DO model should 
presumably be acceptable. This model has been validated in a previous study by Tseng et al. [12], so the DO model 
is employed in this study to solve the radiation transport equations. Byun et al. [21] presented a comparison of 
results obtained by Monte-Carlo, finite volume, and DO method for absorbing, emitting, and isotropically 
scattering medium that is surrounded by discretely heated irregular surfaces. They found the results of Monte-Carlo 
method presented the benchmark solutions within a statistical limit. While the comparative results between hand 
book solution and DO method provide a relative accuracy as also shown in Fig. 5, the maximum deviation is less 
than 8%. As a result, the DO model in this study is believed to be acceptable. Therefore, the radiative heat transfer 
mechanism was presented by the DO model in the following CFD work to improve the accuracy of simulation in 
the present study.

in above equation,      is the net absorption coefficient;    is the scattering coefficient;           is the 
extinction coefficient. Terms I(r,) and S(r,) are the intensity and source term of radiation at a location of (r,), 
respectively.  Ib(r) is the blackbody intensity of radiation at a location of r, and it is independent of radiation. 
However, the absorption and scattering effects of gas are ignored in this study due to the small density of air at 1 
atm. Heat flux balance at each fluid-solid interface can be written as:

forced convection, the farther the chip is from entrance, the higher the surface temperature would be expected due 
to a thicker boundary layer.  
When air flows through an opening substrate, air passes through the opening and goes into the space of another 
channel of the substrate due to the pressure differential near the openings beneath and above the substrate (see Fig. 
7(a)). For instance, the air of Case5 flows upward through all the openings except the opening near the exit, in 
which the pressure above the opening is less than that of beneath. The phenomena have been reflected in the 
temperature profile around the openings as shown in Fig. 7(b). From such mechanism, the air has the ability to 
destroy thermal boundary layer on chip periphery and lower the chip temperature. Fig. 7(c) shows similar reason 
for openings amongst downward chips.

Natural convection to the air is produced under the substrate via buoyancy-driven force, and thus activates 
more heat removal than Case1, which has no opening on the substrate. An appropriate opening would effectively 
enhance the overall heat transfer performance. Cases 2, 3, 4, and 5 present four distinct layouts of opening positions 
on the substrate, and they have performed variant heat removal ability. As main flow parallel to two opening 
positions (i.e., Case4),the first opening position of Case4 is prior to the chips from the entrance, and the chip surface

In CFD simulation results, there exists some difference in values from the measured data due to the 
uncertainties such as the properties of materials and the setup of the experiment apparatus. The main purpose of the 
numerical simulations hopes to provide explanation in phenomena. Fig. 9 presents the temperature distribution of 
y-z cut plane at the coordinate x at the center of the chips via CFD simulations for both face up and down of Case5 
under natural convection. Numerical simulations support the measurement that there exists minor difference 
between face up and down for Case5. It does have upward flow through all the openings around the chips but the 
flow strength is very limited for this case in which every chip dissipates 3W of thermal energy. As expected and as 
shown in the temperature profiles, center chip has thickest boundary layer. Further parametric studies for finding 
better performance are suggested to be done as future work. As a result, comparing with the reference case, Case5 is 
the optimal opening design amongst all the cases studied.

Conclusions 
 This study has experimentally investigated the heat transfer behavior via the use of different opening concepts 
on the substrate under laminar forced convection and natural convection. Coordinating with 3D numerical 
simulation in the present study, those results provide good candidate for further electronic package. The followings 
are the important findings of this study: 
 
1. The experimental results indicated that an appropriate substrate opening layout with the chip faced upward 
under forced convection can reduce the maximum chip surface temperature difference. In the present study T 
was reduced from ~27℃ (Case1) to ~23℃ (Case5). 
2. This study involving experiments and CFD simulation has provided the 3D heat transfer behavior with and 
without opening for chip cooling under both forced and natural convection. CFD implementations provide 
phenomena for us to understand the variations of flow field in the simulation domains. 
3. In forced convection model, chip faces upward served higher heat removal effect than downward orientation.

計畫成果自評 
過去許多研究學者皆以數值模擬討論開孔效應對於電子冷卻之影響，本計畫之執行成果以驗證被動式
開孔效應於電子散熱於實務上之可行性。在實驗擺設當中，量測裝置會造成流場的局部的擾流，且在強制
對流測試當中，整流段的結果還未達到非常理想的狀態，環溫也因人員走動與時空改變而影響了環境條件，
因此在比較CFD模擬與實驗結果中造成了量測誤差，但從實驗與CFD模擬結果可知，此一溫度分佈之有相似
的趨勢。未來進一步的實驗平台設計時必須多加考慮上述與其它可能對實驗造成的影響，才能使量測結果
與數值模擬得到較接近的答案。
