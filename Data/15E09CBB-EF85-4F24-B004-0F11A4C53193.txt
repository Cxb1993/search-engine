Abstract
This project presents the research and development of a novel imaging scheduling
system for the newest generation of low-orbit, earth observation satellite, FORMOSAT-2.
The daily imaging scheduling problem of FORMOSAT-2 belongs to a class of
single-machine scheduling problems with salient features of job-assembly characteristic,
sequence-dependent setup effect, and the constraint of operating time window. The
scheduling problem is first formulated as a monolithic integer programming problem, which
is NP-hard in computational complexity. An approximation of the weighted penalty of
incomplete jobs by penalties of individual tasks facilitates a separable integer programming
problem.
In view of the separable problem structure and researching findings about imaging
scheduling of SPOT-5 in the literature, an integration of Lagrangian relaxation and Tabu
search solution approaches are adopted for novel solution algorithm design and investigation
of their effectiveness. The Lagrangian relaxation algorithm design exploits the separable
problem structure and relaxes coupling constraints with setup effect to decompose the
problem into independent subproblem, each being a simple search for one task’s beginning 
imaging time within its time window. To solve the dual problem, Lagrangian multipliers
are iteratively updated by subgradient (SG) method. The Tabu search algorithm design
then improves the dual constraint-violated solution into a feasible primal solution. It
integrates some important ideas including a greedy-based searching process, boundary
extension by constraint relaxation, a dynamic Tabu tenure mechanism, intensification, and
diversification.
In this project, two hybrid schemes, CASCADE and COMBINATION, are designed for
scheduling optimization. The CASCADE adopts Tabu search techniques to improve the
solution quality of Lagrangian relaxation algorithm directly. The COMBINATION deals
with the development of Tabu search-based feasibility adjustment heuristic in Lagrangian
relaxation algorithm. Numerical results of 7 classes of 70 test cases for 10-minute
scheduling time horizon indicate that the two hybrid algorithms improve the solution quality
of Lagrangian relaxation algorithm significantly. Under the same TS iteration process
(maximum iteration number and program), there are no significant differences on optimality
among two hybrid algorithm and pure TS algorithm. It is concluded that the design of
feasibility adjustment heuristic has significant impact on the performance of Lagrangian
relaxation algorithm. Tabu search algorithm is independent on the initial schedule, because
the Diversification Tabu step has done exclusive exploration over diverse schedules, which
helps Tabu search algorithm to escape from trapping in a local optimum.

2of FORMOSAT-2 indicated that with the help of exploration over diverse schedules, the Tabu
search algorithm was superior in optimality; on the other hand, the Lagrangian relaxation
algorithm achieved near dual optimal and had an advantage in computational efficiency.
Motivated by above observations, in this paper, two hybrid schemes, CASCADE and
COMBINATION, are further developed to generate sound satellite imaging schedules within
allowable computation time. CASCADE adopts Tabu search techniques to improve the solution
quality of Lagrangian relaxation algorithm directly. COMBINATION then deals with the
development of Tabu search-based feasibility adjustment heuristic in Lagrangian relaxation
algorithm. These hybrid schemes are expected to exhibit the advantage of providing not only
good feasible solutions but also a strong indication on the performance improvement to optimal
solution.
The remainders are organized as follows. Section 2 presents the FORMOSAT-2 daily
imaging scheduling problem formulation. The hybridization of Lagrangian relaxation with
Tabu search technique is described in Section 3. Section 4 conducts the numerical experiments
and demonstrates the ability in the applications to FORMOSAT-2 imaging scheduling. Finally,
in Section 5 concluding remarks are made.
2 FORMOSAT-2 Imaging Scheduling Problem
A task is defined as a basic imaging operation unit. Since an imaging request may demand
more than one task, a job (an imaging order) is defined as the collection of all the tasks from
which a request can thus be fulfilled. Some assumptions are as follows.
Assumptions
1. A task only belongs to a job.
2. The satellite only can process one task at time.
3. All jobs are released and given at the beginning of the scheduling time horizon.
4. There are N distinct areas covered by cloud during the scheduling time horizon.
Some notations are defined for modelling the satellite daily imaging scheduling problem.

Window of Cloud Coverage: The mission of FORMOSAT-2 is to acquire substantially
cloud-free images. We accomplish this by employing cloud coverage prediction data sets from
the weather forecast data from Central Weather Bureau (CWB). Any task that intends to take
images of a cloud-covered area is considered invalid.

The objective of our satellite imaging scheduling problem has three folds: (i) to minimize the
weighted penalty of incomplete jobs, (ii) to maximize the suitability benefits of imaging within
the window of opportunity, and (iii) to minimize the total setup costs incurred. Mathematically,
it is formulated as

In (P), the first term is for the weighted penalty of incomplete jobs, the second for
preferences of placements within the window of opportunity, and the third for the costs incurred
by setup operations. For tackling the job-assembly effects, the weighted penalty of incomplete
jobs is decoupling into the weighted penalty of incomplete tasks. Hence, a new mathematical
formulation is defined as (P′), which serves as a lower bound of (P) and is solved by our hybrid
algorithms.

3 The Design of Hybrid Algorithms
The CASCADE design cascades the Lagrangian relaxation and Tabu search algorithms
directly, which is a straight forward way on improving the solution quality of Lagrangian
relaxation algorithm with the help of Tabu search techniques. The framework of CASCADE is
6realistic problem (case No. 2 in TABLE 1) as the baseline data set. The baseline problem
considers 25 imaging jobs (J = 25) with 100 tasks (I = 100) to be scheduled within a time frame
of 600 seconds (T = 600) when the satellite traverses the vicinity of the target area. The setup
time and cost between any two consecutive tasks are randomly generated with mean setup time
and variance to be one second, respectively. For each imaging task, its opportunity window,
suitability function, and imaging mode are all randomly generated. The factors of imaging size
and power consumption for each task are assumed to be identical. They are 1 for PAN, 1.5 for
MS, and 2 for PAN+MS. The power required to setup from task k to task i, is set to be vki =
1.0ski, k, i. For all cases, the corresponding coefficients in the objective function are set to
be Aj = 150,j, Bi = 15,i, and Cki = 2.0ski,k, i. The loading factor of each test case is set
to 0.667. All imaging demands assume to be released at the beginning of the scheduling
horizon.
There are three factors considered as the influences to the algorithmic performance of
optimality as well as the computation time. They are the number of jobs, the setup time, and the
duration of time windows. Parameters of the 7 test cases and comparative results, the average
values of simulation results on optimality and computation time of 100 iterative improvements
are summarized in TABLE 1 and TABLE 2, respectively. The results of Group I indicate that
job-assembly has no significant impacts on optimality and computation time for CASCADE and
COMBINATION designs due to the approximation of weighted penalty of incomplete jobs by
penalties of individual tasks in mathematical formulation. In order to study the setup effects,
three test cases are simulated in Group II. Results indicate that the optimality becomes worse
and computational time becomes larger with the increase of setup times for both designs. The
effects of time windows are studied in Group III. In hard time window case, Case 6, Tabu
search techniques of CASCADE design has no contribution for improvement but Tabu
search-based heuristic of COMBINATION design improves. Both hybrid designs achieve the
optimal value in easy time window case, Case 7. In summary, COMBINATION design is
superior to Lagrangian relaxation in optimality and to Tabu search in computational efficiency.
It indicates COMBIONATION design is an adequate solution approach to solve the daily
imaging scheduling problem of FORMOSAT-2.
