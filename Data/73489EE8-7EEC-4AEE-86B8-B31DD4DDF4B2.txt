hand, the optical code division 
multiplexing access (CDMA) technique 
can provide a sharing bandwidth 
mechanism with the asynchronous or 
synchronous transmission. However, the 
performance of previous optical CDMA 
system is limited by the influence of 
multi-user interference (MUI). In order 
to solve the problem, many researchers 
propose the spectral- amplitude coding 
(SAC) schemes to eliminate the 
influence of MUI recently. Therefore, 
the development of optical CDMA 
systems, such as 1-D (Spectral domain), 
2-D (Spectral/Spatial domain), 3-D 
(Spectral/Time/Spatial domain), and so 
forth, will become an important topic to 
help the development of future 
communication. In addition, a passive 
optical network (PON) nowadays is a 
main architecture for access networks 
since it provides a point-to-multipoint 
(P2MP) solution; typically 32 to 128 
users. A PON consists of an optical line 
terminal (OLT) at central office, a 
number of optical network units (ONUs) 
near end users, and an N optical splitter. 
Thus, its advantage is substantially 
reducing the amount of fiber than that 
traditional point-to-point (P2P) network. 
Therefore, the integration of SAC 
optical CDMA and PON has a new 
turning point to help the development of 
communication. 
According to the mentioned 
causes, we study three topics ： (I) 
all-optical packet switching and DWDM 
integration, (II) the optical CDMA 
system, and (III) the integration of 
optical SAC CDMA and PONs 
applications.  
In the first part, we proposed 
several scheduling algorithms 
incorporated in feedback type WDM 
optical packet switches with self-similar 
traffic. Moreover, the different strategies 
of packet scheduling algorithms to the 
primary output buffers and re-circulated 
buffers in order to find out the best 
strategy that can obtain the best 
performance. On the other hand, we 
develop optical wireless (OW) 
transmission system for urban 
communication. It has been 
demonstrated 16 channels 10Gb/s WDM 
free space transmission over 2.16km 
successfully. Therein, the OW 
transmission experiment is performed in 
Nantou, Taiwan with 2.16km apart. 
In the second part, we investigate 
the optical CDMA system including the 
code design (such as, partial modified 
prime (PMP) code, extended 
m-sequence code (EMC), extended 
perfect difference code (EPDC), and 
diluted perfect difference (DPD) code) 
and the system design (such as, 1-D 
(Spectral domain), 2-D (Spectral/Spatial 
domain), and 3-D (Spectral/Time/Spatial 
domain) optical CDMA system). And 
then, we also propose an error correcting 
coding (ECC) scheme applied in fiber 
optical communication to enhance the 
numbers of simultaneous users. 
According the proposed architectures, 
the numerical results show that proposed 
5 
 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) even after 40 
re-circulations. Therefore, we assume 
that b could be greater than or equal to 
30. Table I lists the common parameters 
and corresponding meaning used in FB 
type WDM OPSes.

1-2 Operation of packet scheduling 
algorithms 
Fig. 2 illustrates the operation of 
“(SF, SF)” packet scheduling algorithms, 
which shortest packet first (SF) 
algorithm is used on the primary output 
buffers and the commonly shared 
re-circulated buffers. In this figure, the 
notation, “packet number (re-circulation 
times)”, e.g., “P5 (4)”, indicates that 
Packet P5 has re-circulated four times. 
At the beginning of some arbitrary time 
slot, six optical packets P1-P6 are 
entering at the input ports of the 
(N+R)x(N-R) WDM OPS. Optical 
packets P1, P2, and P3 are the newly 
arriving ones, and optical packets P4, P5, 
and P6 are re-circulated 3, 4, and 9 times, 
respectively from the commonly shared 
re-circulated buffers. Assume that the 4 
virtual wavelength queues with queue 
lengths 5T, 4T, 3T, and 4T in the 
primary output buffers. 
 
Fig. 2. The operation of “(SF, SF)” packet 
scheduling algorithm. 
Due to adopting two control 
strategies, e.g., the SF algorithm and 
“choosing the virtual wavelength queue 
with the minimum queue length”, are 
applied, the shortest optical packet P3 is 
first transmitted to the shortest queue λ3, 
and then optical packets P5, P1, and P6 
are assigned to enter the buffers in the 
same way. Furthermore, optical packets 
P2 and P4 are sent to the re-circulated 
buffers since there is no space at this 
moment. According to the SF algorithm, 
the shortest optical packet P4 enters the 
shortest queue λ3 in the re-circulated 
buffers, and then optical packet P2 
enters the queue λ1. 
1-3 Performance analysis 
We use a discrete event simulator 
(DES) in C++ to analyze network 
performance. The behavior of the 
self-similar traffic can expressed as a 
7 
 
primary output buffers. 
 
Fig. 5. PLP vs. B of 16x16 FB type WDM 
OPSes using five algorithms with b = 30, DLU = 
10T, L = 0.8, H = 0.9, and R = 8. 
 
Fig. 6. PLP vs. B of 16x16 FB type WDM 
OPSes using five algorithms with b = 30, DLU = 
10T, L = 0.8, H = 0.9, and R = 16. 
Fig. 7 depicts the PLP 
performance versus buffer depth with 
different strategies of using SF and OF 
algorithms when b=30 at R=8 and R=16. 
It is observed that using OF algorithm 
on the primary output buffers leads to 
better performance than using SF 
algorithm. In addition, SF algorithm is 
suitable to apply in the re-circulated 
buffers due to their function being 
mainly on smoothing the traffic 
burstiness and providing extra spaces for 
storing the backlogged optical packets. 
Therefore, we observe that WDM 
OPSes using “(OF, SF)” algorithm can 
provide the best performance.

algorithms with b = 30, DLU = 10T, L = 0.8, H =

（II）光分碼多工存取系統發展 
1. 2-D OCDMA system using PMP 
code and ECC 
1-1 System Configuration 
The proposed transmitter using 
ECC and PMP code sequences with p=7 
and M=3 is depicted in Fig. 12. It is 
composed of a broadband light source 
(BLS), two series of fiber Bragg gratings 
(FBGs), i.e. FBG#1 and FBG#2, and 
three switches. After the spectral 
encoding process is completed, these 
spectral components are respectively 
modulated according to the encoding 
results of input data provided by the 
ECC encoder for error correction 
encoding. Then, via the specific star 
coupler, these optical signals are passed 
to the corresponding receivers in the 
same group. 
. . .
Fig. 12. The proposed transmitter of coded PMP 
system. 
Fig. 13 depicts the proposed 
receiver structure. The receiver is 
composed of two FBGs, i.e. FBG #3 and 
FBG #4, two photodiodes, and ECC 
decoder for decoding process. Therein, 
FBG#3 and FBG#4 have the same 
spectral characteristics as that of FBG#1 
and FBG#2, respectively. After 
receiving optical signals from specific 
star coupler, they are passed into FBG#3 
and FBG#4 for decoding spectral 
components and then respectively feed 
to the upper and lower photodiodes to 
generate electrical current according to 
the input power. Finally, the ECC 
decoder is designed to perform a 
hard-decision Viterbi algorithm. Hence,

since it is too small ( 10≦ -30). Note that 
both lines of uncoded PMP and coded 
PMP systems are flat over the number of 
simultaneous users because MUI is 
completely avoided in both systems.

simultaneous users (data rate 622Mbps, source 
power 10dBm). 
 
Fig. 15. The channel error rate versus number of 
simultaneous users (data rate 2.5Gbps, source 
power 10dBm). 
Fig. 16 depicts the channel error 
rates of all systems are too large when 
data rate is operation at 10Gbps. The 
channel error rate of both uncoded PMP 
system and coded PMP system are over 
10-5 and they are unable to meet the 
error rate requirement of data 
transmission in optic fibers, i.e. under 
10-9. This deterioration of system 
performance cannot be improved by 
increasing the source power. Fortunately, 
the proposed system can be further 
lowered by ECC decoding. 
 
Fig. 16. The channel error rate versus number of 
simultaneous users (data rate 10Gbps, source 
power 10dBm). 
Furthermore, we can observe that 
coded data bit error rate can be under 
10-9 when channel error rate is about 
10-2.5 using the method of the bound 
limit of ECC. Fig. 17 depicts the 
performance of encoded PMP system 
with various threshold parameter 
settings. It can found that the proposed 
system has better performance when the 
threshold parameter a=3, because it 
requires the least source power to reach 
the channel error rate of 3×10-3. In 
addition, we also take into comparison 
between the different photodiodes, such 
as pin photodiode and APDs.

are assigned according to the spectral 
code sequence Xg. After that, the 
encoded optical signals are delivered to 
the different optical delay lines for 
time-spreading encoding according to 
the time-spreading code sequence Yh. 
Finally, these signals are passed to the 
splitter and then switches to different 
couplers according to the spatial code 
sequence Zl. Note that the wavelength 
components of FBG_t1 and FBG_t2 are 
assigned to match 1’s positions of Xg. 
The optical signals are divided into K2 
equal parts, which are passed to the K2 
optical delay lines respectively. Therein, 
the K2 optical delay lines are assigned 
according to Yh. After the 
above-mentioned encoding process, the 
splitter is used to divide the optical 
signal into K3 portions, which are sent to 
the star couplers according to the spatial 
code sequence Zl. 
Fig. 20. Transmitter structure of the proposed 3D 
OCDMA system. 
Fig. 21 shows the structure of 
proposed receiver, which consists of two 
optical combiners, four correlators, four 
balanced detectors, and an integrator. 
Therein, the balanced detector includes 
four sets of FBGs, a delay line, two 
optical circulators, two optical power 
adjustors, and four balanced photodiodes 
(PDs). Here a delay line is used to 
compensate the delay caused from 
different paths to arrive in balanced PDs.

detectors 1 and 3 have the same number 
of gratings and are corresponding to Xg 
for reflecting the spectral components of 
Xg. On the other hand, the balanced 
detectors 2 and 4 also have the same 
number of gratings and are 
corresponding to its complementary Xg .

constructed by using an arrayed- 
waveguide grating (AWG) router to as 
common encoder. The proposed OLT is 
composed of a BLS, a 1 × v splitter, a W 
× W AWG router, MN modulators, and 
W × 1 coupler, where the v output ports 
of splitter are connected to the input 
ports of AWG router according to the 
cardinal of code weight of C0,0. After 
encoding process, W × 1 coupler is 
combine all optical signal and broadcast 
to all ONUs. Each of ONUs is 
composed of three sets of FBGs, i.e. 
FBGs1, FBGs2, and FBGs3, three 
optical circulators, one attenuator, one 
balanced photodiode (PD), and a delay 
line for compensating the delay caused 
by FBGs2 and FBGs3. Therein, the 
ordinal arrangement of gratings in 
FBGs1 is contrary to that in FBGs2 and 
FBGs3 in order to compensate the RTDs 
of matched spectral components. Here 
the bandwidth of each FBG is the same 
as the one of the wavelength channels of 
AWG router. 
1-2 Performance Analysis 
In SAC OCDM system, the 
performance is mainly dominated by 
PIIN and thermal noise [1]. Similarly, 
we also assume that the light source is 
unipolarized and has flat PSD over a 
bandwidth Δf Hz with magnitude Ps/Δf. 
Therefore, the power of average 
photocurrent, i.e. Psig, obtained from the 
balanced PDs when the desired user 
transmits bit “1” can be expressed as  
2 2 2 2/ Wsig srP R P v= , 
where R is the responsivity of 
photodiode, Psr is the effective power of 
light source at the input of each ONU, v 
is the EPDC’s code weight, and W is 
EPDC’s code length. Based on previous 
analysis method, we can deduce the 
average SNR as

versus the number of active users for 
given code, as shown in Fig. 29.

It is seen that the number of active users 
for EMS code is larger than for MQC 
code, complementary Walsh-Hadanard 
(CWH) code, and MS code. Moreover, 
as L increases, a lower BER can be 
obtained with similar code length when 
EMS code is used.

二、計劃成果自評與結論 
In the first year, we propose 
several packet scheduling algorithms for 
FB type OPSes operated under slotted 
and variable length self-similar traffic 
[14]-[15]. First, we compare the 
functions of packet scheduling 
algorithms by employing them on both 
primary output buffers and re-circulated 
buffers simultaneously, and then we 
observe that SF and OF algorithms 
could improve the switching 
performance as they can reduce the 
packet loss due to the lack of buffer 
spaces and the number of re-circulations 
exceeding b, respectively. Next, it is 
observed that the packet scheduling 
algorithms have larger impact on 
switching performance when employed 
in primary output buffers rather than in 
re-circulated buffers. Based on these 
results, we find that “(OF, SF)” 
algorithm, which could process the older 
packets to primary output buffers first
