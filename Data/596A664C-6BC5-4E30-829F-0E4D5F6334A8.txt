ABSTRACT 
This paper focuses on the monitoring techniques in multivariate processes when the underlying 
distribution of the quality characteristics differs from normality. Hotelling T

 control chart is the 
most common used control chart for multivariate process, however, it is  based on the 
assumption of normality. Normality assumption is not always reasonable.  
Researchers gradually applied support vector machine (SVM) to monitor non-normal 
multivariate process. By using SVM, the selection of parameters in SVM will affect the 
classification accuracy of SVM. It is an important issue of choosing the SVM parameters.  
The purpose of this research is to apply SVM in statistical quality control. By simulating 
bivariate t and bivariate gamma distributions, we study the relationship between the distributions 
and parameters of SVM to obtain the best classification rate. After obtaining the proper 
parameters of SVM, we will applied SVM to construct a control chart to monitor non-normal 
process mean and study the performance of the new chart.

II. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE 
A. Review of the support vector machine 
The support vector machine where initially proposed for classifications between two classes 
(Vapnik 1995). The purpose of SVM is to seek the optimal linear hyperplane to separate two 
classes of data. The basic assumption that data is linearly separable, and also deal with linear and 
non-linear information. In this paper, we would discuss about non-linear process data. A 
description of SVM algorithm is follows. Let        liyRxyxyx i
n
iii ,...2,1,1,1,,,,...,, 11  be the 
training set with input vectors and labels. Here, l is the number of sample observations and n is 
the dimension of each observation. The algorithm is to seek the hyperpalne 0 bxw i  to 
separate the data from two classes with a maximal margin width
2
2 w , and the all points under 
the boundary is named support vector (For example, in figure 1). In order to optimal the 
hyperplane that SVM was to solve the optimization problem was following.

In this paper, we will discuss the RBF kernel function, the reason that is the RBF could 
separate data of non-linear and higher dimensions. To using RBF kernel function would only 
adjust  two parameters are C and γ . This is the first choice that user append the kernel function 
III. K-CHART 
K-chart was base on the support vector machine that developed to monitor the multivariate 
process. The control   chart would search the support vector by support vector machine and 
obtain the kernel distance to establish control chart (Sun & Tsung 2003). The control limits of 
k-chart were decided by the boundary of support vector. Therefore, there is no assumption of 
distributions in k-chart. The illustration of two dimensions is following called Hypersphere (in 
figure 3).

IV. NON-NORMAL MULTIVARIATE PROCESS 
In this study, we will focus on non-normal multivariate process that simulation under the 
multivariate t distributions and multivariate gamma distributions. This section describes two 
types of distributions. 
A. Multivariate t distributions 
The bivariate t distribution was extended from unvariate t distribution (Kotz & Nadarajah 
2004). Let X=( ix , jx ) from bivariate t distribution, denote X~ )(2 t was degree of ν. The 
probability density function is following equation:

B. Multivariate gamma distributions 
There are many methods of simulation on gamma distribution. Base on the method proposed, 
we simulate bivariate gamma distributions by Sim (1993). Let Z=( 1Z , 2Z ) from bivariate gamma 
B. Simulation 
In this study, we set the number of quality characteristic is two and four observations. From the 
idea of Stomumbos & Sullivan (2002), setting different degree is 6 and 1000 in t distribution. The 
training data are 100, 500, 1500 and the testing data including 34, 168, 500, 1000 respectively. In 
the simulation data, we would simulate different shift in traing and testing data. 
Otherwise, simulation method of gamma distribution is the same as the t distributions. In order 
to study the correlation of simulation data, we simulate 3 type of correlation 
( 012  ; 2.012  ; 5.012  ). 
 
C. Evaluation 
In this study, we monitor the non-normal multivariate process under the SVM tool. SVM is to 
classify two different categories, so the measurement is ratio of classification accuracy.  
 
VI. RESULTS 
A. Parameter selection 
The simulation result of parameter selection is shown from table 1 to table 4. When the sample 
size is 100 that detect the ratio of gamma distribution is smaller than the others. Otherwise, there 
is no rule on different correlation of parameter combinations. When the data size is 500 that 
display the ratio is higher than others in most situations on table 2.

smaller (n=100), we obtain the best classification rate under more accurate parameter selection. 
After obtaining the proper parameters of SVM, we discuss the performance of the control chart 
based on SVM to monitor non-normal process. The K-Chart obtains the better classification rate 
under monitoring process mean to large shift (≧1.5σ). In the various correlation coefficients, the 
K-Chart obtains the different classification rate. It will obtain the best rate when the process with 
larger ρ. The K-Chart will be able to monitor process well whatever the different non-normal 
multivariate distributions are. 
In the future research the K-Chart will be applied in the time series process. We would discuss 
the performance of K-Chart in monitoring the time series model or extending to the multivariate 
time series.

I. INTRODUCTION 
  Multivariate processes are very important in modern 
industries for multiple quality characteristics. When 
monitoring the process means shifts, traditional control 
charts for multivariate processes are not applicable if the 
underlying distributions are not normal. Several attempts 
have been made in the literatures to extend traditional 
statistical process control (SPC) techniques to deal with 
non-normality.  
Researchers gradually applied support vector machine 
(SVM) to monitor non-normal multivariate process. By using 
SVM, the selection of parameters in SVM will affect the 
classification accuracy of SVM. It is an important issue of 
choosing the SVM parameters. Sun and Tsung (2003) 
developed a new multivariate control chart using the 
approach of support vector machine (SVM), named K-Chart,

without restriction of distribution assumptions. However, 
they did not investigate the performance of K-Chart and no 
comparisons were made between K-Chart and other 
multivariate control charts. 
The primary objective of this paper is to find out the best 
setting of parameters on SVM before establishing K-Chart. 
We simulate bivariate t and bivariate gamma distributions.  
Then we study the relationship between the distributions 
and parameters of SVM to obtain the best classification rate. 
After obtaining the proper parameters of SVM, we will apply 
SVM to construct K Chart to monitor non-normal process 
mean. A secondary objective is to investigate the properties 
and performances of K-Chart by different type of shifts in 
mean vector and different correlations between quality 
characteristics. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, 
the fundamental of support vector machines is reviewed in 
section 2. The construction of K-Chart using support vector 
machine is introduced in section 3. The review of non-normal 
multivariate process is in section 4. Section 5 presents 
simulation study. Section 6 includes the results. Finally, the 
conclusions with some discussions are made in final section.

B. Multivariate gamma distributions 
There are many methods of simulation on gamma 
distribution. Base on the method proposed, we simulate 
bivariate gamma distributions by Sim (1993). Let Z=( 1Z , 2Z ) 
from bivariate gamma distribution denote 
Z~g( 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 ). The parameters of shape 
were 1 and 2 , the parameters of scale were 1 and 2 . 
If 11 XZ  were from unvariate gamma distribution then,

V. SIMULATION 
A. Simulation process  
In this study, we discuss setting parameters of combination 
of C andӫ in SVM. We simulate data of non-normal 
multivariate process. It uses SVM to find the combination of 
parameters. Second, it analyzes the performance of K-Chart 
in monitoring non-normal multivariate process. The 
procedure for simulation process in this study is shown in 
Figure 5. 
Therefore, we use the LIBSVM program from the guide of 
SVM (Hsu 2003). It utilizes the LIBSVM be the program 
interface of this study. We transform the data according to the 
type of LIVSVM and to find the optimal combination of 
parameters under cross-validation.

In the simulation of t2(6) distribution exhibited that the 
accuracy enhanced by the process shift, especial in the large 
shift. When correlation of process was increase, the number 
of support vectors was also increase. If there is less quality 
characteristic, SVM would include the less supports to the 
process data.

In the analysis of t2(20), the accuracy enhanced by the 
process shift (60%~100%). The SVM would include a few 
support vectors whenˮ was increase. Whatever the type of 
multivariate t process, the K-Chart would monitor process 
well. 
Otherwise, the simulation of gamma distribution were 
including two type of degree and different correlation 
coefficient (ˮ =0.2,0.8,) show in table 9 to table 12. 
There was lower accuracy of classification in small 
process shift (less than 2), especially in g2(4,4,1,1) form. If 
the process shift was more than 2, the accuracy enhances of 
g2(16,16,1,1) type. Otherwise, the number of support vector 
is less than 23 in gamma distribution.

邱靜娥與學生-蔡志欣於會場一景 
 
該 IMECS國際會議已第二次於香港舉行，但此次 2009會議地點選擇於
香港富豪九龍酒店，由於該酒店正處於整修外觀的時期，因此酒店之建築物
被竹編鷹架環環包圍，造成酒外觀有如施工現場。此外，對於與會者（住宿
者）的接駁事誼，並未提供完整的服務，造成旅外的與會者對於接駁上有所
困擾。由於 IMECS2010也將於香港舉辦該國際大型研討會議，建議在會場
的選擇與酒店的服務上，應以外國與會者服務為導向。 
 
三、 建議事項 
(1) 目前研究趨勢以國際論文的產出與品質為導向，對於產學的合作與研究
論文的結合更趨重要。因此對於學者的理論研究若能更結合產學業，尤
其目前台灣系屬高科技產業與研發導向為主，更需學界研究學者的合作
投入，將會使國內的學界或產業界朝向更深入的研究與品質提升。 
(2) 此次參與 IMECS2009之國際會議，與博士生同共參與，藉參與國際研討
會的同時，讓學生能廣泛的與國際接觸，雖然於國內攻讀博士班，但對
於國際研究盛會的參與，是可讓學生增廣見聞，以避免與國際隔閡。因
此建議國內的博生研究生可積極的參與國際研討會。
