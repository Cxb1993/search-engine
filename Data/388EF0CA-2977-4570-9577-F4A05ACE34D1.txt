ABSTRACT 
This project developed the heat 
conduction models in the regimes of both 
ultrashort time scales and ultrasmall 
dimension scales and then utilize these 
models to investigate the thermal effects 
for an ultrashort-pulsed laser heating of 
nanoscale thin films. When the 
heat-source pulse duration is smaller than 
the relaxation time of the energy carriers 
or when the carriers’ mean free path 
(MFP) is larger than the material 
dimension, the macroscopic models fail to 
accurately elucidate the heat transport 
between the energy carriers. When the 
laser pulse duration is smaller than the 
relaxation time of the energy carriers, the 
two-step temperature model was used to 
simulate the ultrafast deformation in the 
nanoscale thin films and the thermal 
nonequilibrium between electrons and 
phonons. When the carriers’ mean free 
path is larger than the material dimension, 
the Dual-Phase-Lag model is utilized to 
analyze the heat transfer in the nanoscale 
material. Therefore this study conducted 
the thermal analysis of femtosecond laser 
processing for nanoscale thin films using  
the two-step temperature model with the 
Dual-Phase-Lag model. The results were 
compared with the available experimental 
data and the calculated data obtained 
from Fourier heat conduction as well as 
hyperbolic heat conduction equations.

INTRODUCTION 
Ultrashort laser pulses (USLP) offer a 
variety of advantages for precision 
micro-fabrication1,2. Due to lower 
energetic thresholds for sub-picosecond 
ablation and the controllability of 
individual laser pulses (e.g. by laser pulse 
duration), the amount of energy deposited 
into the processed sample can be

Most of phase-lag models mentioned 
in the previous studies, were supposed to 
be solved with no temperature jumps on 
the boundaries. Since, the dual-phase-lag 
(DPL) model neglects the effects of 
boundary phonon scattering, obtained 
results with imposing no-jump boundary 
condition lead to unsatisfying results 
especially near the boundaries. In this 
section it is to propose a new boundary 
condition in which the boundaries are 
allowed to include temperature jump and 
ballistic diffusion. The new boundary 
condition to use along with the DPL 
model is as follows:

where Λ  is  the  average mean free

selected to be the constants of unity or 
zero, Eqs. (8) and (9) can correspond to 
the first, second or third  kind of thermal

equation based on the Cattaneo equation, 
and the parabolic heat conduction based 
on the Fourier law. The calculated results 
are shown in Fig. 1. by using the 
parameters:

data measured by Brorson et al.10 are 
also plotted in Fig. 2. It is seen from Fig. 2. 
that the normalized temperature 
computed by dual-phase-lag heat 
conduction agrees well with the 
experimental data. On the other hand the 
he normalized temperatures calculated 
using the parabolic and hyperbolic heat 
conduction equations significantly deviate 
from the experimental data. The 
normalized temperature rapidly 
decreases after the laser pulse. The 
dual-phase-lag model gives the lowest 
temperature due to phase lags in material 
absorption and diffusion.

boundary heat losses is slightly higher 
than the experimental data. On the other 
hand, due to the more heat losses at the 
boundary the lower normalized 
temperature than the measured data are 
obtained from the dual-phase-lag heat 
conduction model with jump temperature 
at boundary.

for  dual-phase-lag model with different 
boundary conditions.  
 
It is illustrated in Fig. 4 that the 
temperature varies with the distance from 
the laser-irradiating surface of thin film 
(x=0) at different times. The temperature 
near the surface directly irradiated by 
pulse laser rapidly rises for time from  0 
to 0.4 ps and  then gradually descends  
to an equilibrium temperature of the thin 
film. Since the duration of laser pulse is 
0.1ps, the highest temperature of the thin 
film occurs after the end of pulse laser 
irradiation. 
 Variation of the temperature with time 
at different locations of thin film is 
sketched in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5 it is noted 
that the temperature closer to the 
laser-irradiating surface rises more highly, 
reaches to maximum more rapidly but 
also descends more quickly with time.

Abstract—Laser interaction with a microparticle induces a 
strong near-field enhancement confined to a very small area, so 
this enhanced field can be applied to create nanoscale 
structures on the silicon substrate. In the process of the 
formation for the nanostructures, initially the silicon substrate 
is locally melted due to optical field enhancement between the 
spherical microparticle and the substrate. Then the melt and 
mushy zones occurs and nanostructures form after 
solidification. In order to obtain a further understanding for 
the formation of the nanostructures on the silicon substrate, a 
heat transfer model is employed to predict the shape and size 
of the nanoscale fusion zone on the silicon substrate in this 
proposal. This study calculated the fusion zone induced by the 
scattering field of laser incident on a microparticle

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Nano-manufacturing is receiving significant attention in 
industry and research institutions due to the ever-growing 
interest in nanotechnology. The industrial demand for 
smaller structures required for the manufacture of quantum 
devices, high-density recording media, etc., have resulted in 
the need for fabrication technology at nanometer scale. 
Traditional materials processing in the nanometer range 
using laser technology is very difficult with conventional 
optics due to the diffraction limit of the beam wavelength. 
Recently, a near-field technology has been developed to 
circumvent the diffraction limit [1,2], permitting the spot size 
to be reduced down to 20 nm. In most near-field techniques, 
this resolution is achieved by placing a small aperture 
between the sample and the light source. If the aperture-to-
sample separation is maintained to much less than a 
wavelength, the resolution will be determined by the aperture 
size rather than by the diffraction limit. This near-field 
technique using a single hollow near-field tip to deliver the 
laser beam has been proposed for surface modification and 
lithography on a nanoscale due to optical field enhancement 
in the near-field [3]. However, this approach is difficult to 
implement in an industrial setting due to sophisticated 
hardware to control the near-field distance (approximately 5 
nm above the surface), possible blockage of the hollow tip 
due to material deposition from the machined surface, and 
limited throughput. Another approach involves illuminating 
the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope or an atomic force 
microscope with a pulsed laser [4]. Nanostructures with 
lateral dimensions below 30 nm and therefore well below 
half of the laser wavelength have been produced underneath 
the tip, but with very low serial throughput. 
An approach that may lead to massively parallel 
nanostructuring was demonstrated by using an array of 
micro- or nanospheres as a mask to pattern a solid substrate 
[5-7]. If the diameter of the sphere is greater than the 
wavelength of the incident laser beam, the transparent sphere 
may act as a lens to focus the laser beam onto the substrate 
for surface modification. If the diameter of the sphere is 
equal to or smaller than the laser wavelength, near-field 
enhancement may play an important role in nanostructuring 
the substrate surface. To provide a better understanding of 
the phenomenon, the optical field around the microsphere or 
nanosphere and the formation of the nanostructures on the 
substrate should be analyzed in detail.

called the spot size of the Gaussian beam. Laser beams are

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This paper investigates the fusion zone induced by the 
scattering field of laser incident on a microparticle with 
diameter 1.76 µm. The laser with wavelength 523nm and 
pulse duration 6ns is employed in this study. Considering the 
absorption of the microparticle, the scattered intensity 
calculated by the present model agrees well with the results 
obtained from Heltzel et al [9] as shown in Fig. 2. The 
intensity of the scattering field is about fifteen times than that 
of laser initially incident on a microparticle. Furthermore, 
different from the energy radius of laser irradiating on a 
microparticle, which is about 10µm, the energy radius of the 
scattering field is focused to be about 300nm. These 
phenomena lead to fabrication of nanoscale patterns. 
Figure 3 shows the fusion zone in the silicon substrate, 
which is generated by the scattering field of laser incident on 
a microparticle with diameter 1,76 µm. The width and depth 
of the laser-induced fusion zone are about 400nm and 150nm, 
respectively. However, for the case of laser directly 
irradiating on the silicon substrate, the width of fusion zone 
is only slightly smaller than the energy radius of incident 
laser and the depth is also shallower because the intensity of 
the laser scattered by a silicon microparticle is fifteen times 
than that of incident laser. Figure 4 indicates three-
dimensional temperature fileds in the silicon substrate 
irradiated by the scattering field of laser incident on a 
microparticle
