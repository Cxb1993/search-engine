able neighboring blocks e.g. the Flexible
Macroblock Ordering (FMO) technique in
H.264/AVC. Accordingly, this work pro-
poses that the visual quality of the tempo-
ral error concealment can be improved by
GRNN (General Regression Neural Net-
work) [15] which is a universal approx-
imator for smooth functions. The lost
MB is firstly concealed by estimating the
motion vector from the median or the
average of the neighboring motion vec-
tors. For the concealed MBs which are
not locally-smooth, this work uses the
neighboring MB as the training samples
of the GRNN and estimates the regres-
sion of the corrupted MB. The simula-
tion results demonstrate that if the error
concealment approach is adaptively fol-
lowed by the GRNN improving process,
the entire visual quality will be increased
by about 1 dB of PSNR.
Recently, several approaches [8] [9] used
sparse modeling to extrapolated image
data corrupted by transmission error. Ac-
cording to the available neighbor image
data, the concealed data is a linear com-
bination of some basis functions which are
drawn from a predefined set. The strat-
egy of choosing the basis functions and
their corresponding coefficients is usually
based on the criterion of MMSE (mini-
mized mean-squared-error) of the avail-
able image data. Since the dimension-
ality of the basis functions is more than
that of the available image data, the over-
complete solution usually has an unsta-
ble restored quality which is highly depen-
dent on the structure of the image block.
Especially in the boundary region of the
concealed image block, the discontinuity
of edge deteriorates the visual quality se-
riously.
This work will define a cost function
representing the edge discontinuity of the
concerned pixels. By the method of steep-
est descent, the coefficient vector of the
chosen basis functions moves towards the
direction of the maximum gradient of the
cost function. After a few steps of move-
ment, the concealed image data has better
quality objectively and subjectively. Be-
sides, this work will reformulate the ex-
trapolation process of sparse modeling by
some vector operations, which makes the
process can be implemented easily.

1 Temporal Error Concealment
Lam et al. [10] proposed the Boundary
Matching Algorithm (BMA), which is the
oft-used approach in the early stage. The
BMA assumes the pixels on the boundary
of the corrupted MB and its neighboring
blocks are very similar. Therefore, the au-
thors compared the the boundary pixels
of a lost MB with those of the previous
picture located in the same position to
search a suitable MB for concealment of
the corrupted MB. Because the suitability
is only determined by the boundary pix-
els, the structure continuity can not be
kept across MBs. Many approaches [3] [5]
[6] are thus proposed for improving the
concealed quality.
Another common temporal error con-
cealment is based on the assumption
where motions of the objects in the cor-
rupted MB and its adjacent region is
locally-smooth, and thus estimates the
motion vector by the average or the me-
dian of motion vectors from spatially ad-
jacent MBs [18]. However, not all MBs
can be concealed well especially for those
MBs located in complicated moving area.
Chong et al. [4] thus proposed the cor-
rupted MB can be recovered by recon-
structed edges and progressive median
motion vector. The reconstructed edges
are detected and concealed portion by
portion .

Let uj be the basis chosen in the (n+1)th-
iteration. The coefficient cj should be de-
termined by minimizing the approxima-
tion error:
E(n+1) = ‖Ma · (e
(n) − cjuj)‖
2 (7)
By setting,
∂E(n+1)
∂cj
= 0 , (8)
cj can be determined by:
cj =
[
Ma · e
(n)
]t
[Ma · uj ]
[Ma · uj]
t [Ma · uj]
. (9)
As for the selection of uj , the reduc-
tion of approximation error△E should be
maximized, where
△E = E(n) −E(n+1)
= ‖Ma · e
(n)‖2 − ‖Ma · (e
(n) − cjuj)‖
2
= 2cj
[
Ma · e
(n)
]t
[Ma · uj]
−c2j [Ma · uj ]
t [Ma · uj ] . (10)
By Eq. (9), △E can be given by:
△E =
{[
Ma · e
(n)
]t
[Ma · uj ]
}2
[Ma · uj ]
t [Ma · uj ]
. (11)
In the initial step, g(0) is 0 and there-
fore e(0) will be f . Then, by Eq. (11), the
basis uj which maximizes the reduction of
approximation error will be selected, i.e.,
uj = arg max
uk∈Φ
△E(uk) , (12)
and the corresponding coefficient cj is
then determined by Eq. (9). This proce-
dure will keep continuing until the reduc-
tion rate is smaller than a preset value.

1 Improving Visual Quality by
GRNN
This section will introduce how to use
GRNN to build a regression model for im-
proving the recovered quality of temporal
error concealment. Every corrupted MB
is firstly concealed by estimating the mo-
tion vector which can be the median or
average of the adjacent motion vectors.
Analyzing the concealed result, it is found
that some corrupted MBs which are not
locally-smooth will be recovered with se-
rious visual defects. Let s be the vari-
4
function in Eq. (14) has a maximum
reduction. The ∆c can be found by the
steepest descent approach step by step,
and be given by:
∆c = −∇J(c) . (15)
The scalar λ controls the descent rate
which should be properly set to avoid un-
stable adjustment. From Eq.(14), for any
coefficient ck,
∂J(c)
∂ck
=
∂
∂ck
‖D ·
N∑
i=1
ciui‖
2
= 2(D ·
N∑
i=1
ciui)
t ·D · uk .(16)
Accordingly, the moving vector ∆c can
be given by:
∆c = 2(D ·
N∑
i=1
ciui)
t ·D ·Φ . (17)
Equation (17) can determine how to ad-
just the coefficient c in each iteration to
alleviate the block artifact. This proce-
dure will be terminated when the mag-
nitude of gradient vector ‖∇J(c)‖ drops
below a present threshold.

To demonstrate the performance of the
proposed approach, the video was as-
sumed to have corrupted MBs as shown in
Fig. 4(b), which simulates the packet-loss
scenario for video coded by FMO tech-
nique. All the corrupted MBs are firstly
recovered by conventional motion vector
estimation approach, where the motion
vector is estimated by the average or me-
dian of the adjacent motion vectors. Fig-
ure 5 shows the improvement for entire
video of the the proposed approach. The
proposed approach obviously outperforms
the conventional BMA approach. Addi-
tionally, no matter what kind of MV es-

timation approach is used, the concealed
quality can always be raised by GRNN.
Figure 4(c)–4(f) show the subjective qual-
ity of the simulation results.
To demonstrate the performance of the
proposed approach, the original image
shown in Fig. 6(a) was assumed to have
missing blocks with size of 16 × 16 dur-
ing image transmission, and the degraded
image was shown in Fig. 6(b). The con-
cealment process by sparse modeling was
terminated when the reduction rate of ap-
proximation error is less than 1%. The
concealed result was shown in Fig.6(c),
where the PSNR is 24.94 dB. As the ap-
proach proposed in this work, since the
edge continuity was remained, the con-
cealed quality was therefore improved and
the PSNR was increased to 29.02 dB , as
shown in Fig. 6(d).

摘要 
This work aims to improve the temporal error concealment for the 
corrupted macroblocks whose motions are not locally-smooth. It is 
demonstrated that the recovered quality by the oft-used motion 
estimation approaches is not visually satisfied for those MBs of which 
adjacent MBs do not have a consistent movement. Therefore, this work will 
propose and demonstrate that, if the conventional error concealment 
approach is followed by the nonparametric regression approach GRNN, the 
concealed quality will be raised. The simulation results will show the 
proposed approach indeed improves the performance of error 
concealment and the improving gain is about 1 dB of PSNR.

(中文) 視頻通訊領域中之錯誤隠藏主要可分為空間域與時間域之錯誤隠藏。而時間域錯
