Hydrogen permeation and separation of PdCuP/Al2O3 composite 
membranes prepared by electroless co-deposition 
 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
2 μm-thick Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloys were prepared on porous 
alumina substrates to form PdCuP/Al2O3 composite membranes by electroless co-deposition. 
Effects of the composition of PdCuP alloy on the hydrogen permeability and permselectivity of 
PdCuP/Al2O3 composite membranes were investigated at temperatures of 623-773 K and 
pressures of 207-483 kPa. The gas permeation experiment was carried out in a home-made 
steady-state permeation set-up. Pure gas permeability tests were conducted using hydrogen and 
nitrogen. The surface morphology, thickness, composition and phase structure of PdCuP alloys 
were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopic 
analysis (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The grain size of PdCuP alloys decreased with 
increasing of the Cu content in PdCuP alloys. XRD analysis indicated that Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 alloy 
contained fcc-PdCu and Pd15P2, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 alloy contained a mixture of fcc-PdCu and 
bcc-PdCu, and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy contained only bcc-PdCu. Hydrogen permeance increased 
with increases of operating temperature and transmembrane pressure difference. The result of 
gas permeation tests showed that the Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 alloy had the best hydrogen permeability 
of 4.14 × 10-8 mol/m2-s-Pa at 773 K, the Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 alloy had the best H2/N2 
permselectivity (α＝37.5) at 773 K and 276 kPa. The pressure exponent (n) approached to 1 
revealed the surface reaction is the permeance rate-controlling step of hydrogen in PdCuP 
alloys. 
1. Introduction 
The demand of high purity hydrogen in the petrochemistry, semiconductor and aerospace 
industries is increasing with the development and progress of technology【1-5】. The purification 
and separation of hydrogen is an importance issue of such industries membrane separation 
method is one of the cost-effective routes for purification and separation of hydrogen. Among 
them, metallic membranes are preferable for hydrogen purification because of their high 
hydrogen selectivity, good mechanical strength and fabricability. Pd is the main metallic 
membrane material, because palladium membranes have high hydrogen absorptivity, high 
hydrogen permeability, chemical compatibility and excellent hydrogen selectivity【6,7】. However, 
the application of pure palladium membrane for the hydrogen separation is restricted by its 
hydrogen embrittlement and high cost. Hydrogen embrittlement which caused by the 
transformation of α and β palladiums and reduced the hydrogen permeation is occurred when 
palladium contacts with hydrogen at temperatures below 573K and pressures below 2 MPa【8,9】. 
The effect of hydrogen embrittlement on hydrogen permeation can be reduced by alloying with 
metals such as silver, nickel and copper【10-12】.  
PdCu alloy membranes exhibit a better resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and the

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 PdCuP alloy composite membranes 
Figures 2a-d shows the surface morphologies of pure Pd, Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 
and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy membranes, respectively. Compared with pure Pd, the surfaces of 
PdCuP grain were smoother than that of pure Pd grain. The grain size of PdCuP alloys 
decreased with increasing of the Cu content in PdCuP alloys. The grain size of electroless Cu is 
small, so the grain of PdCuP alloys became small as the Cu adding in Pd and the grain size 
decreased as the the Cu content increased. Figures 3a-d shows the cross-section images of pure 
Pd, Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy membranes. The average 
thickness of the pure Pd and PdCuP alloy membranes are about 2μm.  
3.2 Structure of PdCuP alloy composite membranes by XRD 
Figures 4 shows the diffraction pattern of Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and 
Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 composite membranes after annealing under hydrogen stream at 773K for 1h. 
Figure 4a shows the XRD patterns of Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 composite membranes. The diffraction 
peaks of fcc-PdCu appeared at the 2θ angles of about 41.4, 48.2, 70.5 and 85.3, the other 
diffraction peaks in pattern were identified to be Pd15P2 phase. The XRD analysis indicated that 
Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 alloy contained fcc-PdCu and Pd15P2. Figure 4b shows the diffraction pattern of 
Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 alloy composite membranes. The main diffraction peaks which appeared at the 
2θ angles of about 30.1, 43.1, 53.5, 62.4, 70.8 and 78.7 is bcc-PdCu, the other diffraction peaks 
in pattern were identified to be fcc-PdCu. The intensities of bcc-PdCu peaks are higher than 
that of fcc-PdCu. The result revealed that Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 alloy contained a mixture of fcc-PdCu 
and bcc-PdCu. Figure 4c shows the diffraction pattern of Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy composite 
membranes. The main phase of Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy is bcc-PdCu. No other phases were found 
in Fig. 4c, indicated that Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy contained only bcc-PdCu. 
The phase structure of PdCuP alloy composite membranes determined by XRD analysis 
revealed that Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 alloy contained fcc-PdCu and Pd15P2, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 alloy 
contained a mixture of fcc-PdCu and bcc-PdCu, and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy contained only 
bcc-PdCu. 
3.3 Hydrogen permeability and permselectivity of the PdCuP alloy membranes 
Figures 5a-d shows the dependency of hydrogen flux on the pressure difference of the 
pure Pd, Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy membranes at the different 
temperatures. Hydrogen permeability increased with an increase of operating temperature and 
transmembrane pressure difference, because of hydrogen permeating through Pd and PdCuP 
alloy membranes via solution-diffusion mechanism. The hydrogen flux was proportional to the 
square root of hydrogen pressure difference in accordance the pressure exponent (n) 
approached to 1, revealed the surface reaction is the permeance rate-controlling step of 
hydrogen in Pd and PdCuP alloys. The Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3 alloy had the best hydrogen permeability 
of 4.14 × 10-8 mol/m2-s-Pa at temperature of 773 K.  
Figures 6a-d shows the activation energies for hydrogen diffusion through the pure Pd, 
Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 lattices were determined from the 
temperature dependence of the fluxes between 623 and 773K. The activation energies of 34.9, 
29.4, 25.9 and 22.6 kJ/mole for hydrogen diffusion through the pure Pd, Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, 
Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy were determined by Arrhenius equation, respectively. 
Hydrogen diffusion through Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy membrane needs the lowest activation energy 
in these PdCuP alloys may be due to the high mobility of hydrogen atoms within the bcc 
structure.  
Figures 7a-d shows the effect of average pressure on the permselectivity for the pure Pd, 
Pd85.1Cu12.6P2.3, Pd60.5Cu38.1P1.4 and Pd53.9Cu44.8P1.3 alloy membranes, respectively.

Abstract 
 
Al2O3-NiP spectrally selective composite coatings were deposited on Al substrates 
to form Al2O3-NiP/Al solar absorbers by electroless composite coating. This work 
aims at studying effects of the Al2O3 particle size, the Al2O3 content, the thickness of 
Al2O3-NiP composite coating and the anti-reflection（AR）layer on the optical 
properties of Al2O3-NiP composite coatings. The optical properties including 
absorptance（αsol）and thermal emittance（εtherm）were measured in the wavelength 
interval of 0.3-2.5 and 2.5-20 μm by using the UV/VIS/NIR and FTIR 
spectrophotometers equipped with integral spheres, respectively. The Al2O3-NiP 
composite coatings containing 70 nm Al2O3 have better optical properties than that 
containing 300 nm Al2O3. The αsol and εtherm of Al2O3-NiP composite coatings increase 
with the increasing of Al2O3 content. Increasing the thickness of Al2O3-NiP composite 
coating and adding the AR layer obviously improve the optical properties of 
Al2O3-NiP/Al absorbers.

目前文獻中大部分以逐層析鍍法製備 PdCu 合金膜，尚無以共析鍍法製備的相關
研究被提出。本研究係利用無電鍍法製備鈀及鈀銅磷合金/多孔氧化鋁複合膜，
進行性質分析及氫氮氣體滲透之研究。本實驗成功地以無電鍍共析鍍法，在經
表面改質的多孔氧化鋁基材上製備不同鈀銅成分比的鈀銅磷合金/多孔氧化鋁
複合膜，雖然氫氣氮氣的分離效果能有待加強，但以共析鍍的一道簡單製程，
可降低多道析鍍製程的繁瑣，有效降低製程成本，有利於精細化工、半導體工
