to measure the performance of receivers for current satellite navigation systems as well.
2 Problem description
Software receivers draw more and more attention because of their flexibility to demodulate
a number of distinct RF transmissions and the removal of several analog components at
RF band. The basic idea is to place ADC as near the antenna as possible in the chain of
RF front-end components [1]–[3]. Two features should be mentioned for a software receiver.
First, the ADC takes samples at either intermediate frequency (IF) band or radio frequency
(RF) band. The bandpass sampling applies and the associated sampling rate is usually much
higher than the rate we sample at baseband [7]. Secondly, since most applications require us
to process signal at baseband, the processor needs to implement the rest down-conversion in
digital domain. For the first feature, high sampling rate always requires more computational
power and storage. Hence few bits ADC (i. e., ≤ 4) are usually selected to reduce the required
resource. However, fewer bits quantization induces significant degradation. The worst case
happens when receiving multi-band RF signals which suffer different attenuations. That is,
most bits are used to represent strong signals and weak ones may degrade a lot and even be
completely neglected through quantization process. For example, in satellite propagations
under 6 GHz, amplitude scintillation induced by ionospheric irregularity may go up to 20
dB between different bands [21]-[23].
In the remaing context, we investigate the effects caused by few bits quantization. First,
we provide a signal model and then define the degradation measure of a signal through
quantization process. Next, we simulate and calculate the degradation regarding carrier
frequencies, sampling rate, signal power ratio and ADC bit number. Finally, we discuss the
simulation results and the applications of these results.

r(t)sk(t)dt
, (1)
where k = 0, 1 . . . K− 1. The symbol Qm[·] denotes quantization process using m-bits ADC
and Tlcm is the least common multiple of T0, T1 . . . TK−1 satisfying
Tlcm = NTs.
The Eq. (1) can be regarded as the correlation ratio of r(t) and s(t) for the digital domain
and the analog domain. Hence the proposed degradation measure has an insightful meaning
because in a software-defined receiver, digital down conversion is usually implemented after
ADC as shown in Figure 3. In high SNR cases, Eq. (2) can be approximated as
Dk ≡ 10 log10
|∑N−1n=0 Qm [r(t = nTs)] ·Qm [sk(t = nTs)] |∫ Tlcm
0
|sk(t)|2dt
, (2)
which intuitively evaluates quantization effects through digital down conversion. Notice that
the down conversion acts like a matched filter for a sinusoidal signal which actually reduces
environmental noise effect.
5 Simulation
5.1 Factors and mean degradation
Without loss of generality, we consider a signal consisting of two sinusoids given by
r(t) = A1sin(2pif1t + φ1) + A2sin(2pif2t + φ2), (3)
where (A1, f1, φ1) and (A2, f2, φ2) are amplitude, frequency and phase of the first signal s1(t)
and the second signal s2(t), respectively. Assume carrier frequencies satisfy f2 > f1 and uni-
form quantization is adopted in our case. We are interested in the degradation through
quantization regarding ADC bit number, sampling-rate-to-carrier-frequency-ratio (SCR),
carrier-to carrier-frequency-ratio (CCR) and signal-to-signal-power-ratio (SPR) defined in
8
decreases or ADC bit number increases, SCR and CCR have less effect on degradation of weak
signal. For frequency plan, once SCR or CCR is determined, we can select the least ADC bit
number considering possible attenuation difference of dual-band signals to meet the required
degradation performance. In addition, from Figure 4 and Figure 5, when ADC increases
one more bit, we attain 6 more dB tolerance for SPR. This is reasonable since a weak signal
s2(t) is “immersed” in the influence of another stronger signal s1(t) through quantization
process. This phenomenon becomes more significant when fewer ADC bit number are used.
Intuitively, each bit can preserve weak signal by 6dB lower than another strong signal. Hence
in Figure 5, we have significant degradation gap when SPR= 6dB, 12dB, 18dB and 24dB at
ADC bit number=1,2,3 and 4, respectively. Besides, we choose ratio of carrier frequency to
carrier frequency and ratio of sampling rate to carrier frequency in order to apply our results
to a broad scope. For SCR, it is obvious that lfs to lf2 have the same degradation as that
of fs to f2 through quantization because discrete samples in both cases are identical, where
l is an integer. For CCR, when f1 to f2 becomes lf1 to lf2, the samples in each case are
different and hence degradation performance may be different. Fortunately, the effect can be
evaluated through SCR. This can be seen in the following when we have carrier frequencies
lf1 and lf2 in Eq. (3) with sampling rate fs = 1/Ts given by
r(t = nTs)
= A1 sin(2pilf1nTs + φ1) + A2 sin(2pilf2nTs + φ2)
= A1 sin(2pi
f1
fs
l
n+ φ1) + A2 sin(2pi
f2
fs
l
n+ φ2).
Hence the effect would be the same as we change sampling rate and can be evaluated by
adjusting SCR.
6 Sampling schemes
Assume the frequency and phase of the strong signal s1(t) can be well estimated. Two
sampling schemes are provided to extract weak signal s2(t) in the following.
10
when 1/(2NbR) is small. Next, in order to have enough samples to estimate parameters, this
range should cover at least a wavelength of s2(t). Hence
|T2| ≤ T1
2Nb+1piR
⇒ f2
f1
= CCR ≥ 2Nb+1piR = 2pi
√
SPR. (9)
From Eq. (9), the greater the SPR, the greater the frequency difference we need to implement
this scheme. This is reasonable because the greater the difference between two signals, the
greater the probability we can distinguish them. Note that this scheme requires acceptable
AGC reaction time.
6.2 Scheme 2
Consider digital down conversion structure in a software-defined receiver as shown in Figure
3. Let the sampling period
Ts = (
M
2
+
1
L
)T1, (10)
where M,L ∈ nonnegative integers and L ≥ 1. We take samples at t = nTs + t0, where
t0 satisfies Eq. (5). Then the crosscorrelation component for weak signal extraction at the
output of digital down converter is given by
N−1∑
n=0

Let CCR= k2/k1 and N be the least common multiple of Lk2 and 2, where k1 and k2
are positive integers. Then Eq. (11) vanishes as desired. Notice that we consider infinite
ADC bits in the above schemes in order to simplify the analysis. Eq. (11) may not vanish
completely as we have finite ADC bits.

inates the environmental noise, and magnitude difference between each sinusoids suffering
ionosphere scintillation may go up to 20 dB [6]. The work can be extended to software
multi-band receivers for GPS or satellite communications under 6 GHz [18][23][5, Chapter
12], when we consider noise effect which may become compatible with interference. In addi-
tion, noise effect may induce significant error in frequency estimation and phase estimation
of strong signal and need further investigation. This would be our nest step.

三、與會心得 
 
First, two goals are expected to achieve in attending ION GNSS 2007 conference: 
(1) Orally presenting our work on software receiver--『A Novel Scheme and Modified 
Structure for Improved Software GPS Receiver』. The application is on 1-bit GPS 
software receivers and tri-band beacon (TBB) software receiver. The associated paper 
will appear in the ION GNSS 2007 proceedings. 
(2) Exchanging experience and collect comments from other experts in software receiver 
field to improve our work in the coming future. The most interesting work in the 
conference which may help for our next step are in the following: 
1. The work in Session B3b #4, “Processing Losses with One-Bit Quantization” by 
Betw and Shnidman, discusses the bandlimiting, sampling and quantization 
effect of 1-bit sampling case for GNSS receivers. The framework quantifying 
these effects is worth to study for our 1-bit software-defined receiver. 
2. The work in Session C1 #5, “A New GNSS Software Receiver Signal 
Acquisition Method Research Based on Ambiguity Functions, “ by Wan and 
Chao, suggest that the acquisition of GNSS receiver may be facilitated by 
ambiguity function techniques which is widely used in radar. Although the
