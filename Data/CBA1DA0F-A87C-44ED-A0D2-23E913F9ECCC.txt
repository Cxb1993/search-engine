where cF is the Coulomb friction, sF is the static friction
and sv is the lubricant parameter. The control objective is
to find a control law so that the mover position )(tx can
follow a desired trajectory )(txd in spite of various model
uncertainties. If the dynamics of a PMLSM drive are exactly
known, then the control objective can be achieved by using
model-based approaches. One way to take advantage of a
priori knowledge of the dynamics and payload mass
information is to calculate the desired force. However, it is
difficult to determine motor parameters accurately due to its
inherent nonlinearity and various uncertainties. This paper
will develop a SORNFN control scheme for the trajectory
tracking of a PMLSM drive. Two structures of SORNFN are
used in this paper, one SORNFI for directly generating the
feedfoward compensation law, and the other SORNFC for
counteracting the effect of modeling errors and external
disturbances.
3. Structure of SORNFN
Recurrent neural fuzzy networks are multilayer
connectionist structure and have an internal feedback loop to
model a dynamic system effectively. Thus, the RNFNs have
superior dynamic ability to deal with time-varying input or
output than feedforward neural networks. Combining the
fuzzy-logic framework and the concept of temporal
operation, a novel SORNFN is developed in this paper,
which incorporates internal feedback loops in such a way
that each recurrent state corresponds to a fuzzy rule that
linearly combines its own firing history and those from other
rules.

4. SORNFN control system
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of mixed
feedforward/feedback based SORNFN control system used
in this paper. Two structures based on SORNFN are applied
to the trajectory tracking control of the PMLSM drive
system. The SORNFI is constructed to model the inverse
dynamics of the PMLSM as a feedforward controller, while
the SORNFC is used as an error-feedback compensator to
minimize the trajectory tracking error. To effectively control
the PMLSM and alleviate the influence of parameter
variation, friction, and external disturbances, structure and
parameter learning algorithms are concurrently performed
in the SORNFN control system online.
4.1. Description of SORNFI and SORNFC
The inputs to the SORNFI are the desired tracking
command tdx and its output is the force tuI . Two
types of learning phases, the off-line learning and the
on-line learning, are used to construct SORNFI. That is,
through collecting the input-output data from PMLSM
movements, we first use SORNFI to learn the inverse
dynamics via off-line learning, and then we employ the
error force signal generated from SORNFC to further online
adjust the parameters of SORNFI. Figure 3 shows the
off-line learning phase. The error signal used for
backpropagation is obtained by comparing the output force
of SORNFI and the input force of PMLSM derive system,
that is, II uue  . This off-line learning phase is an open
loop, which can provide the necessary nominal force to
PMLSM to follow a desired trajectory. However, when the
PMLSM derive system is subject to unknown uncertainties,
the off-line learning of SORNFI can not achieve the desired
tracking control. In order to overcome the drawback of the
off-line learning phase, an on-line learning phase proceeds
xu

to identify the best SORNFI for the inverse dynamics of
PMLSM. As shown in Fig. 2, the actual output of controller
is
CI uuu  (18)
where Cu is the output of SORNFC. In the control system,
the SORNFC plays an assistant to compensate the
deficiency of the desired control signal resulted from
unexpected disturbances. Its output Cu is also taken as an
error force signal for further online adjusting the parameters
of SORNFI in a changing environment. If the tracking error
)(~ tx tends to zero, the SORNFC products no output. It
therefore implies that the SORNFI learning has converged.
The inputs to SORNFC is the error measure ts and
ts , and its output is the force Cu , where ts is the err
function defined by  t dxktxktxts 012 )(~)(~)(~)(  . The
error function described by provides a stable manifold
 0ts , which renders the tracking error tx~
exponentially converging to zero as t . The term ts
is an error measure deviating from the stable manifold. As a
result, the control objective will be accomplished by forcing
7Since the rule nodes do the product operation, only the error
signal should be propagated in the rule layer. In the
membership layer, the update laws for parameters of input
membership functions are derived as

5. Experimental results
A PMLSM drive system is used in this paper to verify
the performance of the proposed SORNFN control scheme.
The experimental setup consists of a host PC, a DSP
controller board, an IGBT inverter, a linear optical encoder,
a PMLSM and other elements. The PMLSM was
manufactured by HIWIN Co. The parameters of the motor
are: kg89.0m , Ns/m2.1B  4.2R , mH25.2L ,
N/A20tk . The pole pith, stroke length, maximum speed,
9indicated in Fig.7 to be obtained after about 200 times of
online learning. The proposed SORNFN control scheme
can effectively adjust the corresponding network structure
and parameters to adapt to the dynamic uncertainties. The
tracking errors of the NFN, RNFN, SONFN and SORNFN
control systems are shown in Fig. 8. The proposed
SORNFN control scheme is less sensitive to the disturbance
than the other three control systems. As a result, the
proposed SORNFN control system indeed yields superior
control performance than the NFN, SONFN and RNFN
control systems.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, a novel SORNFN architecture is
proposed and successfully applied to a mixed
feeforward/feedback position tracking control of a PMLSM
drive. The experimental results show that the proposed
SORNFN control scheme provides a greater flexibility and
better performance than feedforward NFN control systems.
The trained SORNFI captures the inverse dynamics of the
PMLSM well and the SORNFC achieves the desired
trajectory tracking with minimal errors. An experimental
system was established using a PMLBM, a DSP controller
board, an IGBT inverter and other elements to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

namely, SORNFN identifier (SORNFI) and SORNFN controller (SORNFC).
Structure and parameter learning algorithms are concurrently
performed in SORNFN online. The fuzzy rules in SORNFN can be either
generated or eliminated to obtain a suitable-sized network structure,
and a recursive recurrent learning algorithm based on the gradient
decent method is derived for the parameter learning.
