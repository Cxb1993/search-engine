parallel manipulators can be related by =A t Bq& , 
where A is the forward Jacobian matrix, and B 
is the inverse Jacobian matrix. The two 
dimensionally homogeneous Jacobians 
(developed using characteristic length) along 
with some isotropy conditions have been 
utilized for developing 6-DOF isotropic parallel 
manipulators.12-14 Klein and Miklos proposed 
the following isotropy conditions to get around 
the problem of dimensional homogeneity:15 
(i) The first three rows of the Jacobian are 
equal in length and orthogonal. 
(ii) The last three rows of the Jacobian are 
equal in length and orthogonal. 
(iii) The two subspaces spanned by the first 
three rows and the last three rows of the 
Jacobian are orthogonal. 
Nonlinear equations developed from these 
conditions were solved numerically to obtain 
some sets of six straight lines, and many 
combinations of 6R isotropic serial 
manipulators can be developed from one set of 
six straight lines. The origin of the reference 
frame is used as the tool center point (denoted 
by TCP hereafter), and the six straight lines 
define the six revolute axes of an isotropic serial 
manipulator. The six straight lines associated 
with the six revolute axes of an isotropic serial 
manipulator can also be employed to develop 
6-DOF isotropic parallel manipulators. In this 
case, the jth straight line is associated with the 
unit screw that is reciprocal to all the passive 
screws on the jth kinematic chain. A reference 
point along with the six straight lines is called 
an isotropic generator.16 Many isotropic designs 
can be easily developed from an isotropic 
generator. Furthermore, isotropic generators can 
be employed to develop redundant manipulators 
or 6-DOF parallel manipulators with different 
shapes or different types of kinematic 
chains.17-19  
This work proposes methods for developing 
new isotropic generators. Numerical methods 
are first employed to develop some isotropic 
generators. The characteristics of the obtained 
generators are studied and then utilized to 
propose some special patterns of six straight 
lines that have similar relative positions with 
those of the obtained generators. Many new 
generators can be easily obtained by 
optimization methods using the related data of 
the proposed patterns of straight lines as the 
initial values. The new methods also allow us to 
specify the location of the TCP, the size of the 
platform or the base, or the shape of isotropic 
parallel manipulators. Isotropic Stewart-Gough 
parallel manipulators with the platform and the 
base represented by two planes are studied in 
detail. How to develop isotropic manipulators 
with different shapes or different types of 
kinematic chains is also investigated. Several 
numerical examples are provided for 
illustration. 
  
2. CHARACTERISTICS OF ISOTROPIC 
GENERATORS 
An isotropic generator consists of a reference 
point P and six straight lines iL for i = 1, 2,…, 6. 
Let H be the matrix with the 
Plucker&& coordinates of the jth straight lines:  
 
jL
⎡ ⎤= ⎢ ⎥×⎣ ⎦
j
j j
e
ρ e
                (1) 
 
as its jth column vector, where unit vector je  
defines the direction of the jth straight line, and 
jρ  is a vector from point P to a point on the 
straight line. Then an isotropic generator can be 
obtained if matrix H satisfies the three isotropy 
conditions. Figure 1 shows two special 
generators that have been utilized to develop 
isotropic serial manipulators, redundant 
manipulators, or parallel manipulators with 
different shapes or different types of kinematic 
chains. The first and second designs in Fig. 2 
are developed from the first generator. The two 
isotropic designs are obtained by placing the 
spherical joints at the intersecting points of the 
six straight lines of the generator with two 
parallel planes. In the second design, the two 
planes (representing the two fixed bases) are on 
 4
the relative positions of the six straight lines iL  
(for i = 1, 2,…, 6) satisfy 
,• = • = •1 2 2 3 1 3e e e e e e  • = • = •4 5 5 6 4 6e e e e e e , 
and the second condition in Eq. (4). With point 
P as the reference point and jρ = jPA , matrix H 
can be expressed as functions of 1 2, ,r r 3 4, ,r r  
2 3, ,θ θ 4θ , 3h , 4h , and the z-coordinate of point P.  
For 6-DOF manipulators, the closeness to 
kinematic isotropy can be evaluated by a 
previously proposed normalized isotropy 
measure:20

conditions. The measure (which yields the 
optimum value of μ = 1 for an isotropic 
configuration) will be used as the objective 
function to develop isotropic generators. 
4. ISOTROPIC GENERATORS 
This section employs optimization methods to 
obtain new isotropic generators and utilizes 
them to develop some special 6-DOF isotropic 
parallel manipulators with SPS chains.  
 
4.1 Generators with 3 4h h∗ > 0 
Many general isotropic Stewart-Gough parallel 
manipulators can be developed using isotropic 
generators. This section focuses on some special 
manipulators whose platform and base are 
represented by two planes, and the spherical 
joints are placed around a circle on each plane. 
In this case, an isotropic design can be obtained 
by placing the spherical joints at iA and iB , and 
connecting them with the direction of each 
prismatic joint parallel to the related straight 
line for i = 1, 2, …, 6. The desired generators 
can be developed by letting R = 1 2r = r ,  r = 3 4r = r , 
and h = 3h = 4h .  
Measure μ  is independent of size and 
physical units, so some geometric constraints 
are needed to avoid obtaining many equivalent 
generators of different sizes. In this work, we fix 
the volume V (which represents the size of a 
manipulator) and the height h of the frustum of 
a right circular cone. In this case, radii R and r 
can be related as 
 
( ) 12 2 2 21r 12 h V 3 h R h R
2 h
π π ππ
⎡ ⎤= − −⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦  (6) 
 
With V = 10000 and h = 10, we provide zP  
(the z-coordinate of point P) to optimize 
objective function μ , and some of the 
optimization results are listed in Table 1.  
Figure 4 shows the isotropic design with zP = 
15. The obtained manipulator, however, is not 
symmetric and is subject to link interactions. 
Figure 5 shows a different pattern of straight 
lines for developing symmetric manipulators, 
where angles 1φ  and 2φ  satisfy 1 2 120oφ φ+ = . 
Many practical designs can be developed from 
 6
defines the direction of the reciprocal screw. If 
1•1e u = 2•2e u =…..= •6 6e u  = λ  ≠ 0, then 
Eq. (7) can be rearranged as  
 
 λ⎡ ⎤ ′= ≡⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦
F
H τ H τ
C
             (8) 
 
where τ  denotes the vector of actuator forces. If 
H satisfies the isotropy conditions, then ′H  
also satisfies the conditions. Therefore, a 6-DOF 
isotropic parallel manipulator can be obtained 
if :(i) the TCP is at point P of a generator; (ii) 
the six straight lines associated with the six 
reciprocal screws are coincident with straight 
lines i iA B  for i = 1, 2,.., 6 of the generator; and 
(iii) •j je u  yields the same non-zero value for j 
= 1, 2,.., 6.  
For Stewart-Gough manipulators, •i is u  = 1 
for i = 1, 2,.., 6, so an isotropic design can be 
obtained by placing the tool center point at point 
P, and the two spherical joints of chain i on iA  
and iB . A PSS chain with •i ie u  = 1 is 
equivalent to an SPS chain. Therefore, an 
isotropic design with PSS chains can be 
developed from an isotropic Stewart-Gough 
manipulator by replacing the SPS chains with 
PSS chains (with •i ie u  = 1 for i = 1, 2,.., 6). 
Figure 10 shows an isotropic manipulator with 
six PSS chains developed from the design in Fig. 
2c. A PRRS chain with twist angles 1 2α α= = 0 
has the property of •i ie u =1, so an SPS chain 
can also be replaced by a PRRS chain. Figure 11 
shows another isotropic design developed from 
the design in Fig. 2c by replacing three SPS 
chains with three PRRS chains. The direction of 
each prismatic joint on a PRRS chain is parallel 
to the direction of the related straight line. 
Isotropic manipulators with six PSS chains 
and 1• ≠i ie u  can be developed by choosing 
iu  through point iB  such that vectors iu and 
i iB A  have the same angle between them for i = 
1, 2,.., 6. However, only fractions of the actuator 
joint rates/forces are transmitted to the mobile 
platform because 1• ≠i ie u . Higher degree of 
resolution for fine position and force control can 
be obtained for a smaller •i ie u , but 
smaller •i ie u  also indicates that a manipulator 
is closer to inverse kinematic singularity. Some 
practical designs require special alignments of 
the prismatic joints. For example, the six 
prismatic axes of a Hexaglide type manipulator 
are placed along three straight lines in a 
horizontal plane. Additional constraints can be 
added to obtain practical designs. Figure 12a 
shows a generator developed from 3 4h h= = 10 
with constraints 1•1e u = 2•2e u =…..= 
•6 6e u , where i i+3
i i+3
B B
B B
= =i i+3u u  for i = 1, 2, 
3. An isotropic design (with •j je u  = 0.8165 
for j = 1, 2,.., 6) developed from the generator is 
shown in Fig. 12b. Other isotropic parallel 
manipulators with different shapes or different 
types of kinematic chains can be developed 
using similar approaches. 
  
6. CONCLUSION 
This work presented methods for developing 
new isotropic generators. Some properties of 
isotropic generators were obtained and utilized 
to propose two special patterns of six straight 
lines. Many new generators were developed 
using the related data of the straight lines as the 
initial values in optimization methods. The 
obtained generators were employed to develop 
parallel manipulators with different shapes and 
different types of kinematic chains. In the future, 
the proposed methods can be extended to 
develop other classes of isotropic generators, or 
we can search for the isotropic design with 
optimum global dexterity.
