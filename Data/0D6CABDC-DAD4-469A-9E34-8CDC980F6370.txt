ABSTRACT 
A fast and motion-insensitive technique suitable for myocardial BOLD contrast imaging is 
presented. The method, termed T2-TrueFISP, combines T2 magnetization preparation with 
steady-state free precession imaging for T2 relaxation mapping of the myocardium in healthy 
volunteers. T2 contrast to noise was optimized with the use of transient-state TrueFISP readout 
and half-Fourier readout with linear phase encoding. Single-slice myocardial T2-weighted image 
was obtained within one heartbeat and a single slice T2 map of the myocardium was obtained 
under 5 to 7 seconds. A respiratory navigator gating method was incorporated for serial 
measurements and signal averaging, with the subjects freely breathing. Mean myocardial T2 
relaxation measured in twelve healthy volunteers was 54 ± 5.7 ms. Regional variations of T2 
values across the myocardium were 7%. Temporal variations across serial T2 measurements in a 
transmural region covering approx. 0.5cc of a LV wall were 3.6% without signal averaging 
(NEX=1) and 1.7% with signal averaging (NEX=10). According to our preliminary results, the 
T2-TrueFISP method is expected to provide a robust and sensitive tool for clinical application of 
myocardial BOLD contrast imaging. The proposed pulse sequence has been successfully 
implemented and transferred to Harvard medical school to evaluate the performance of this 
sequence. The result of this project has been written in to a manuscript and published in Magnetic 
Resonance in Medicine( SCI impact factor=3.468).

Several techniques have recently come out for imaging T2 BOLD contrast in the heart and 
demonstrated good correlation with myocardial perfusion changes in animal models (7-9,16). 
These techniques all apply magnetization preparation for generating T2 contrast in the 
myocardium and use either fast-low angle shot, spiral or steady-state free precession readout for 
rapid imaging of the heart. 
Among these techniques, the method based on balanced steady-state free precession imaging 
(SSFP, also denoted TrueFISP, FFE or FIESTA by different vendors) is of particular interest. 
Balanced SSFP offers excellent signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios and shares with spiral 
and FLASH imaging techniques sub-second scan time and inherent flow compensation. Image 
contrast generated by SSFP technique is controlled by the entire RF preparation scheme (before 
and during readout) and consists of a complex combination of proton density and T2/T1 contrasts 
when the signal is collected before entering steady state. 
Current SSFP technique applied to cardiac BOLD contrast studies uses prospective ECG 
gating, segmented k-space acquisition and T2 magnetization preparation and extracts BOLD 
contrast from signal intensity changes in T2-weighted images (7,9). The signal is collected before 
reaching steady state and the strong T2 weighting generated by the magnetization preparation 
retains mixed T1 and proton density components. In order to track the BOLD signal during a 
pharmacological challenge, signal intensity variations due to drug-induced changes in heart rate 
or cardiac displacements to the receiver coil need to be removed first. As a result, the technique, 
which has been shown highly sensitive to BOLD contrast in animal models, remains limited to 
relative regional assessment of myocardial perfusion changes (7,9).

to a level adequate for clinical BOLD contrast application in the heart. 
METHODS 
A transient-state TrueFISP pulse sequence with T2 magnetization preparation (T2-TrueFISP) was 
implemented on a 1.5T whole-body MR system (Magnetom Sonata, Siemens Medical Solution, 
Erlangen, Germany) for the measurement of myocardial T2 relaxation (19). The pulse sequence 
consisted of three blocks, (i) T2 magnetization preparation (T2-prep), (ii) transient state 
stabilization, and (iii) transient state TrueFISP readout (see Figure 1.a).  
T2 relaxation was measured by varying the echo time of the T2 preparation block. The 
accuracy of the technique was validated in MnCl2 phantoms, using a standard CPMG multi-echo 
technique for reference T2 measurements. Myocardial T2 measurements were collected on 
healthy subjects using T2-TrueFISP . Finally, T2-TrueFISP was evaluated with two different 
free-breathing acquisition methods, based on the use of prospective acquisition correction 
technique (PACE) (20) and synchronized breathing imaging (SBI), respectively. Pulse sequence 
parameters and acquisition protocol were optimized for myocardial imaging (19), including 
T2-prep echo time (TET2-prep), transient state TrueFISP echo train and methods for minimizing 
physiological motions during data acquisition. 
T2 magnetization preparation 
As described in a previous study of myocardial T2 relaxometry (15), two modes of T2 
magnetization preparation were implemented for collecting images at echo times selected for 
maximum T2 contrast in the myocardium. Magnetization preparation at the first echo time

monitoring respiratory motion (20). Briefly, the technique consisted in collecting a low flip angle 
FLASH image covering the subject’s lungs every 100ms and recording the navigator echo signal 
from a pre-selected column across the subject’s lung and diaphragm. The time-series of navigator 
echoes was processed real time for extracting the respiratory trace and the ECG signal recorded in 
parallel. Navigator and T2-TrueFISP imaging blocks were executed in an interleaved order. 
Triggering of the TrueFISP imaging block was activated when the detected diaphragm level 
reached a target respiratory phase at a preset delay after the ECG R-wave (20). Using this “double 
triggering” technique, T2-TrueFISP images were obtained during simultaneous end-expiratory and 
end-systolic phases. 
The performance of the PACE respiratory gating method was compared to a synchronized 
breathing imaging method (SBI). ECG-triggered T2-TrueFISP images were collected every 5 to 6 
seconds. Subjects were instructed to breathe after each image acquisition (evident to the subject 
by the loud noise induced by gradient switching) and to hold their breath at end expiration until 
the next image acquisition. Using this method, subjects were able to breathe comfortably between 
image acquisitions. 
T2 measurement validation by phantom study 
Phantoms prepared with graded concentrations of MnCl2 (approx. 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5mM) 
were used for assessing the accuracy of the measurements over a range of T2 relaxation times 
(20-120ms) covering the myocardial T2 value. T2-TrueFISP images were collected at six 
different echo times (TET2-prep: 2.59ms, 22ms, 44ms, 55ms, 66ms and 88ms, TR/TE: 2.5/1.25ms, 
 10
TrueFISP images were obtained at alternating TET2-prep of 2.59ms and 55ms. Two short time series 
of twenty-one short-axis images (10 pairs following one dummy scan) were collected using the 
two respiratory gating methods. A longer time series of sixty-one TrueFISP images (30 pairs 
following one dummy scan) was obtained using T2-TrueFISP with PACE in five of the subjects. 
With a repetition time between images of 5 to 7 seconds (respiratory cycle), the total acquisition 
times for the short time series and the long time series were approximately 2.5 and 7 minutes, 
respectively. 
Data analysis  
All data sets were fitted to a mono-exponential model of T2 relaxation, independently of the 
number of echo times collected. T2 maps were computed on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In the 
phantom data sets, images collected with T2-TrueFISP and MESE at the four echo times 22ms, 
44ms, 66ms and 88ms were used for data fitting. Additional data fitting was applied to the image 
pairs collected with TrueFISP at TET2-prep of 2.59ms and 55ms. In the human data sets, the first 
image collected of each T2-TrueFISP series was discarded systematically to avoid possible 
effects from prescans (adjustments of signal offset, receiver gain, and resonance frequency). The 
subsequent echo time pairs were used for data fitting. T2 relaxation was measured in eight 
transmural ROIs radially distributed over the four walls of the left ventricle (ROI sizes ranging 
from to 13 to 25 voxels). The average T2 relaxation time was calculated for each ROI. The 
standard deviations of the T2 values across the eight ROIs were calculated for each subject to 
assess spatial T2 variation (σT2) within the single slice collected. Mean T2 and standard

In Vivo T2 measurements 
Figure 2 shows a pair of T2-weighted images of a mid short-axis slice acquired in a subject using 
T2-TrueFISP and the corresponding computed T2 map. The T2-TrueFISP images appear free of 
artifacts and display homogenous blood pool signal inside the left ventricle and a good definition 
of the LV walls and papillary muscles, reflecting the excellent flow compensation and the high 
spatial resolution of the SSFP technique. 
Table 1 summarizes the breath-hold myocardial T2 measurements collected in twelve 
subjects using T2-TrueFISP. The mean myocardial T2 value was 54.03 ± 4.26 ms and the mean 
spatial T2 variation expressed as coefficient of variation, was 7.4 ± 2.5% (4.0 ± 1.6ms). 
Serial T2 measurements collected using PACE versus SBI for respiratory gating produced 
similar myocardial T2 values and showed no difference in temporal variations (see Figure 3). The 
mean temporal variations of myocardial T2 measured in the eight LV ROIs in eleven subjects were 
3.7 ± 1.4% (1.3 ± 0.6ms) and 3.8 ± 1.1% (1.6 ± 0.9ms), using PACE and SBI respectively 
(p=0.7946). 
Figure 4 shows T2 maps and temporal STD maps collected in a subject, from two series of 
repeated T2-TrueFISP measurements respiratory gated with PACE. The series were collected 
over the same duration (approx. 7 minutes) and the images were computed with and without 
signal averaging (30 measurements with NEX=1 and 3 measurements with NEX=10). The 
averaged T2 map calculated with signal averaging is, as expected, much less noisy (Fig. 4.b) and 
the temporal variation of myocardial T2 is reduced by a factor of 2 using NEX=10. The mean 
temporal variations in the eight LV ROIs measured in five subjects were 3.6 ± 1.0% (2.1 ± 0.6ms) 
 14
characterization of complex T2 relaxation behavior was not explored in this study. Instead, a 
simple mono-exponential model was assumed for estimating T2 relaxation in the myocardium.   
The phantom study showed good agreement between T2-TrueFISP and MESE measurements 
of T2 relaxation, and a small to moderate overestimation (2-12%) by T2-TrueFISP depending on 
the number of echo time steps. (Variable signal decay during the magnetization preparation 
composite RF pulses may account for this error and could be reduced by shortening their pulse 
widths and/or lengthening the inter-echo period (26)). The stability of the T2 measurements with 
changing flip angles of the TrueFISP readout demonstrated that the image contrast was dominated 
by the T2 magnetization preparation and that contrast from the transient-state TrueFISP readout did 
not contribute to the T2 relaxation measurement to a relevant extent. 
In vivo measurements in the volunteers are in good agreement with prior reports of 
myocardium T2 relaxation measured in humans (15,27). High definition of the ventricular walls 
was desirable for the myocardial T2 maps. In order to obtain a spatial resolution of 2-2.7mm, a 
readout time of 190ms was necessary with our TrueFISP technique. Such readout duration is long, 
compared to the cardiac phase we selected for imaging (end-systole). Nonetheless, the cardiac 
images obtained in our healthy volunteers did not show any severe blurring artifacts.  
We have demonstrated that T2-TrueFISP allows single-slice myocardial T2 relaxation 
measurement in a single breath-hold. We have incorporated the PACE respiratory gating method in 
our technique, allowing the subjects to breathe normally during the whole study. Large series of 
repeated measurements can be collected for increasing the sensitivity to T2 change (such as those 
induced by pharmacologic stress) through signal averaging. The main sources of noise contributing 
 16
(σT2TrueFISP = 1.7 ± 0.8 % and σT2Spiral = 4.8 ± 1.4 %). Accounting for the higher spatial resolution 
and the longer total acquisition time used with the spiral study, we anticipate that the spiral 
techniques should produce the same level of temporal variation for equivalent imaging parameters 
(Spiral: Tacq~5 mins and voxel size = 10 mm3 vs. T2-TrueFISP with PACE and NEX=10: 
Tacq~2.5 mins and voxel size = 24 mm3). We can thus expect T2-TrueFISP imaging to be as 
sensitive as T2prep spiral imaging for the detection of dynamic changes in T2 myocardial 
relaxation.  
Based on the T2 BOLD contrast measurements reported in porcine and canine studies and the 
derived correlations with myocardial perfusion changes (7-9,16), we can estimate the sensitivity of 
our T2 mapping technique to the BOLD signal generated in the myocardium during 
pharmacological stimulation. Assuming minimal changes in myocardial oxygen consumption 
during stimulation and given our measurement of baseline shot-to-shot T2 variation of 3.6%, our 
technique should allow the detection of local T2 change corresponding to 2.1 ± 0.4 fold increase in 
myocardial perfusion in a region covering approximately 0.5cc of a LV wall. In addition, using 
signal averaging and PACE respiratory gating, the sensitivity of the technique is expected to allow 
the detection of 1.5 ± 0.2 fold change in myocardial perfusion using a NEX=10 factor. These 
sensitivity estimates compare favorably to the previously reported BOLD contrast sensitivities to 
myocardial perfusion change measured in animal models, ranging between 2.5 and 3 fold (7-9,16).  
The design of the present study had a few limitations. The study included only single-slice 
measurements and data analysis was limited to transmural regions of the LV walls. Clinical 
application of the T2 mapping technique will require full coverage of the heart, using either serial

Dixon Fat-Water separation by dual-TR bSSFP sequence 
 
T-Y. Huang1

Introduction 
Dixon addition/subtraction for separating fat/water in bSSFP by adjusting system resonance frequency was proposed in our previous 
study. However, achieving phase change by altering system frequency, the bSSFP images turned out to be more sensitive to shimming 
condition. In this study, we proposed an alternative design of fat/water separation by dual-TR bSSFP sequence with better tolerance of 
shimming condition.. 
Materials and Methods 
Figure 1 shows the phase behavior presented in our previous paper for muscle and fat at 3.0 Tesla as a function of TR and center 
frequency offset. Abbreviations “ip” and “op” represent in-phase and out-of-phase 
behavior for muscle and fat, respectively. Note that phase behavior of muscle and 
fat changes according to TR selection of bSSFP sequence for the on-resonance 
condition. Using this property, we can acquire bSSFP images with two different 
TRs to acquire in-phase and out-of-phase images for Dixon separation processing 
while maintaining system on resonance (i.e. off-resonace frequency=0Hz). 
Furthermore, the tolerance of shimming condition also varies according to TR. 
For example, an image acquired with TR of 4.55ms is anticipated to be in-phase 
while tolerating the shimming linewidth of about 200Hz (length of the right red 
bar). And out-of-phase image can be obtained by using TR of about 2.5ms while 
keeping similar shimming tolerance (length of the left red bar) as TR of 4.55ms. 
Combining the phase property of dual-TR and the fact that bSSFP signal is almost 
identical under the condition (TR<<T1, T2), Dixon fat/water separation can be 
achieved by post-processing with the bSSFP images acquired with two TRs 
(4.55ms and 2.5ms). 
Three subjects underwent three-dimensional dual-TR bSSFP scan on a 3.0 Tesla 
MR system(Siemens Trio, Erlagen, Germany) with imaging parameters 
(TR:4.55ms/2.8ms, TE=TR/2, Flip angle=24 degrees, matrix=192x128, 
FOV=360x360mm ) and a T/R head-coil. A 3D volume covering lower calves 
were acquired. The acquired k-space raw data were transferred to personal 
computer with Matlab® system (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for Dixon post-processing. 
Results 
Figure 2 shows the Dixon-separated fat(fig.2a) and water(fig.2b) images 
collected from one of the volunteers. Note that the subcutaneous fat and the 
bone marrow were almost separated from the muscle. Slight artifacts were 
found on the upper-end of the calf due to low signal outside the head-coil. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
In this study, a novel dual-TR bSSFP scheme was proposed for the Dixon 
fat/water imaging. Using two specially selected TR, the in-phase and 
out-of-phase phenomena between fat and water can be achieved while 
tolerating a wider off-resonance condition then the previous report[2]. In 3T, 
TR around 4.55ms was optimized for in-phase condition whereas TR less than 
2.5ms was optimized for out-of-phase condition. However, due to system 
limitations, even RF length was already shorten by using 3D acquisition, TR of 
2.8ms was the shortest possible repetition time we could achieve at this 
moment. Nonetheless, the preliminary results of the proposed technique still 
showed promising. Since the dual-TR scheme does not require the 
sophisticated sequence modifications, we thus anticipated that this method can
