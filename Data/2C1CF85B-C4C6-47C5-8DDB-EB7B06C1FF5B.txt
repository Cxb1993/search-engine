2solution, which will etch the active GaAs layer
and the cladding AlGaAs. Next followed by the
second step wet etch which we etched the
pedestal below the GaAs disk by dilute HF
solution. The SEM image of the fabricated
microdisk device is shown in Fig. 1.
3. Measurement results and discussions
We measured the optical properties of our
microdisk laser devices by optical pumping
through a μ-PL setup. Pumping source laser was
focused by a microscope objective to the
microdisk top. The microdisk luminescence was
then collected and spectrally analyzed by a
monochromator and a cooled InGaAs detector.
The samples were placed in a cryostat cooled by
liquid nitrogen.
We have measured the microdisk cavity
with 4-m-diameter and above [11,12]. The
smaller disk may suffer more diffraction loss,
and the scattering at the rough edge may cause it
much difficult to achieve lasing. The smaller
microdisk laser can have wider WGM spacing,
and potentially possible to control the resonant
wavelength. The microdisk fabricated by
two-step wet etching can achieve lasing at a
smaller size, and our smallest size which
achieved lasing was 2.2 m, at 78 K, and
pumped by 780 nm Ti:sapphire laser, the
measured spectrum and the integrated
luminescence versus incident power are
illustrated in Fig. 2.
The WGMs we studied here are assumed to
be the fundamental TE slab modes due to the
incident polarization. The WGMs can be
characterized by the radial number M and
azimuthal number N which indicate the number
of field maxima along the radial and azimuthal
direction. Together with the polarization, a

4temperature rises. Also, the wavelength of the
resonant WGM detuned away from the QD
density of states in higher temperature
measurements cause less gain contribution from
the QDs. Both effect may raise the microdisk
laser threshold and finally prevent the device
from lasing.
4. Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated quantum dot
embedded microdisk laser cavities by the e-beam
lithography and wet etching technologies. These
fabricated microdisks can achieve lasing with
smaller sizes. The smallest microdisk which
lases at 78 K is with 2.2 μm in diameter. By
controlling the etching condition, single mode
operation can be achieved at microdisk about the
size of 3 μm in diameter. Also, the lasing 
behavior is observed at the temperature as high
as 170 K.
