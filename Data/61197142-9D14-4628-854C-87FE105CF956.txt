英文摘要 
Keywords：Loss tangent, permittivity, printed circuit board, propagation constant. 
 
A frequency domain procedure was explored to recover permittivities of printed circuit board 
(PCB) materials for high-speed and wideband applications. The propagation constant of buried 
stripline was first extracted from the measured scattering parameters of two test lines with 
different lengths. The accuracy of the recovered propagation constant was shown to be 
comparable with that of the time-domain short pulse propagation (SPP) method. The 
conventional empirical formulas were used to estimate conductor dissipation that was then 
subtracted from the measured total loss to recover the true permittivity of the PCB material. The 
experimental results indicate that more sophisticated empirical formulas are needed to accurately 
recover wideband loss tangent.

loss, and roughness-compensated conductor loss [12]-[14]. A 
convergent iterative procedure was established among 
dielectric constant (ε
r
), empirical formulas of characteristic 
impedance, and phase constant (β) to recover real dielectric 
constant. The conductor loss (α
c
) is estimated based on 
models of characteristic impedance, conductor loss 
mechanisms, and measured structure parameters of the 
testing stripline. It is then subtracted from the measured total 
attenuation (α) to recover dielectric loss (αd). Finally the 
empirical formula for dielectric loss is used to recover loss 
tangent (tanδ) or dissipation factor (Df).

III. PROPAGATION CONSTANT RECOVERING 
In order to evaluate the accuracy of our model, the same 
test vehicles for the industrial standard SPP method are 
evaluated. Two kinds of PCB boards are evaluated: one is 
resin rich that contains 70% resin and one oz. copper, the 
other one is resin poor that contains 50.5% resin and half oz. 
copper. The structure parameters are designed to make the 
characteristic impedance near 50 ohms and the line lengths 
are designed to be L1 = 3.0 cm and L2 = 9.8 cm.  
The electrical excitations are launched from vector network 
analyzer (VNA) into the test lines through SMA connectors. 
The VNA is calibrated to the terminals of connecting coaxial 
cables to reduce measurement uncertainty. Fig. 3 exhibits one 
of the measured S-parameters. The transition regions 
between coaxial cables and test lines, which are modeled by 
matrices A and B, still cause certain amount of mismatch 
perturbations. 
The recovered phase constants (β) exhibit nearly no 
dispersion. The recovered attenuation constants (α) are 
compared with those obtained from SPP method in Fig. 4; 
they are consistent to each other. For lossy PCB substrates, 
these observations manifest that this two-line model can 
efficiently and accurately recover wideband propagation 
constants even suffering mismatch perturbations.

V. CONCLUSION 
Measurement models for recovering propagation constants 
of PCB transmission lines and permittivities of PCB 
materials are proposed. Recovered data are compared with 
those obtained from the industrial standard SPP method, and 
advantages and defects are explored. Detailed analyses show 
that its capability to recover wideband propagation constant 
of transmission lines is comparable to that of the SPP method. 
Based on available empirical formulas, however, there still 
exist errors on the recovered loss tangent in lower frequency 
range. It needs to search for more wideband and sophisticated 
empirical formulas that properly account for conductor loss 
to accurately recover permittivity.
