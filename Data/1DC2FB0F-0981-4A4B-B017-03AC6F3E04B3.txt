notations concerning us here are aoaoao 
for cubic, a-a-a- for rhombohedral, a-a-co 
for o2, and a
-a-c+ for o1, where + 
denoting in-phase tilting (by an angle, for 
o1: ψ = 6o)4 between adjacent octahedra 
and – anti-phase tilting (by an angle φ = 
8.8o).4 Different designations of space 
group to o-phase perovskite: Pmcn,3,4 
Pcmn,9 Pnma,1,2,5,10 and Pbnm3,4,11 (all 
being No.62) arise due to various settings 
of the crystal axes.12 Knight3,4 used 
non-standard (but equivalent 
crystallographically) settings of F3 2 /n 
(for r) Incn (for o2), and Pmcn (for o1) 
for all the space groups (of the hettotypes) 
below the aristotype cubic-BaCeO3 phase. 
The space group Pbnm is assumed here 
for the room-temperature o1- (or 290
oC-) 
phase, thus Ibmm for the o2- (400
oC-) 
phase when the conventional (bac) axes 
in standard orientations12 are chosen as 
(abc) for Pbnm. The o1→o2 phase 
transformation upon heating is 
second-order with mixed displacive and 
order-disorder when the change of 
pseudo-cubic cell volume is progressive.5 
The o2→r transformation is first-order 
while the r→c also being progressive in 
volume change is again second-order.  
As LaGaO3 is centrosymmetric,
13 
operations are restricted to rotation and 
reflection. The {101}o, {121}o and (110)r 
twins determined for single crystal 
LaGaO3 cycled through the phase 
transformation temperature in situ using 
TEM,14,15 and synchrotron X-ray 
topography16 were generally consistent. 
The former two were the reflection twins. 
Another type of twins usually occurred in 
association with the {101}o ones was 
found in many other orthorhombic 
perovskites, e.g., silicate MgSiO3, 
A3+B3+O3 LaGaO3, A
2+B4+O3 CaTiO3, 
and A1+B5+O3 NaNbO3. With a 90
o 
rotation about [001]o, they are often 
termed [001]90o (rotation) twins
14 or 
{101}o 90
o twins. The {110}r twins are 
unique to A3+B3+O3 perovskites, e.g., 
SmAlO3,
17 observed in the 
high-temperature rhombohedral phase. 
From the space group symmetry,14,15,16 
although twinning by pseudo-merohedry 
is anticipated,18-21 only the reflection or 
rotation twins, not the inversion ones, 
may occur upon the r→o phase transition 
since both LaGaO3 phases are 
centrosymmetric. Crystallographic data 
for both phases are listed in Table II, 
including the symmetry elements.22  
The microstructure of 
pressureless-sintered BaCeO3 ceramics is 
analysed using TEM. Twins observed in 
orthorhombic BaCeO3 grains are 
determined for the twin laws and the lost 
mirror plane symmetry upon the r→o 
phase transformation. The twins of the 
reflection type are confirmed by the 
tilting technique under TEM as described 
by Boulesteix et al.23  
Experiment procedures  
 Commercially available barium 
carbonate (BaCO3) and ceria (CeO2) 
powder, both of > 99.9% purity, supplied 
by Nippon Chemical (Tokyo, Japan) 
were used to prepare BaCeO3 powder via

Fig. 2(b)) indicates the twin is of the 
reflection type with twin plane lies in 
(1 1 2 ). Titling experiment23 performed 
both parallel (Fig. 3(a)) and 
perpendicular (Fig. 3(b)) to the USR 
confirms its being a reflection twin. 
Figure 3(c) shows bright-field (BF) 
image of a representative microstructure 
containing twin boundary exhibiting 
domain fringes. Imaging under 
strong-beam conditions using g = 2 04 is 
also shown inset. The boundary fringes 
imaged both in BF and centred dark-field 
(CDF) appeared asymmetric and 
symmetric patterns,24 respectively, are 
inset. Domain boundary exhibiting 
δ-type fringe patterns when it appears 
inclined to the electron beam. 
 The indication is that the (1 1 2 ) 
twin boundary consists of a displacement 
with its length not related to the lattice 
translation in a simple way. The fault 
vector R has also been determined24 
adopting the invisibility criteria 2πg.R = 
0 where n = integer. Table III shows the 
invisibility criteria performed using 
g-reflection vectors from three zone axes. 
The fault vector of R = ε [021] is 
deduced accordingly, where similar to 
that for ferroelectric twin boundaries in 
t-BaTiO3,
25,26 ε represents its length is 
non-fractional of the lattice translation 
vector 
 
(2) {110) reflection twins 
 Similar observations were obtained 
from analysing the domain boundary 
shown in Fig. 4(d). Corresponding 
SADP’s are shown in Figs. 4(a)-(c), 
respectively, for domains I, II, and 
boundary I+II. Titling experiment23 (Fig. 
4(e) and (f)) also confirms its being a 
reflection twin. Fault vector R = ε[1 1 0] 
from domain fringes exhibiting the 
δ-fringe patterns (inset in Fig. 4(d)) were 
also determined again adopting the 
invisibility criteria (Table IV).  
Discussion 
 The orientation relationships of both 
the {1 1 2 ) and {110) reflection twins 
can be determined by plotting 
corresponding stereographic projections
Those of the {
. 
1 1 2 ) twins ar
schematically in Fig. 5(a), with all 
parallel zones identified experimentally 
show in Figs. 2(a)-(i). The stereographic 
projections for domain in Fig. 2(j) 
sharing a twin plane (
e illustrated 
1 1 2 )I,II are shown 
in Fig. 5(b). The crystallographic 
orientation relationships describing the 
{112) twin law can be respected by the 
transformation matrices written in 
column matrix forms. The transformation 
matrices for directions and planes 
accordingly are:
