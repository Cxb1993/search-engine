solar light that enters through windows and solar panels. A piston 
cylinder air compressor adjusts the moderate control of air flow and 
the ambient temperature and temperature of room in the hybrid 
system. The hybrid system using natural ventilation in passive 
strategies designs an innovative HVAC system can be called ’lung’ 
of a building. The design process integrated with ‘‘whole building 
approach’ and ‘‘new material’ is used to analyze the theoretical 
performance of this building by energetic analyses for the weather 
in HsinChu. A mathematic model will be resolved by the helps of 
MATLAB 7.0 program and CFD software. The energy required by 
air-conditioning and thermal will be predicted. A finite difference-
Fortran program (Hybrid-HVAC) is developed based upon the 2D 
unsteady heat equation with a Stefan moving boundary problem. 
This program is modified into a Hybrid-HVACP and should enable 
the hybrid system building with the PV/T、EAHE and SSPCM to 
be solved numerically with high accuracy. The simulation results in 
this work reveal that if the difference between ground temperature 
and ambient temperature is less than 5 K, such as in HsinChu city, 
the HVAC results obtained using EAHE are unsatisfactory, and so 
EAHE yields better results in areas with large temperature 
differences.

photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) air collector around 34% 
and a thermal efficiency of the photovoltaic/thermal 
(PV/T) without airflow is of 8.5%. The thermal 
efficiency of the PV/T air collector was increased by 
25.5% by causing the air to flow. Barnwal and Tiwari [5] 
investigated the design, construction and testing of a 
hybrid photovoltaic integrated greenhouse dryer. Dincer 
[6] studied the energetic performance of heating systems 
for building in two geothermal districts and found 
energy efficiencies of heating systems in the Balcova 
geothermal district and Salihli geothermal district of 
39.36% and 59.31%, respectively. Dincer [7] examined 
the relationships between energy and exergy, energy and 
sustainable development, energy policy-making, exergy 
and the environment and exergy. In study of the hybrid 
system design, and the construction and testing of 
integrated hybrid photovoltaics, the work of Nayak and 
Tiwari [8] [9], Dincer [7] is drawn upon to conduct the 
theoretical analysis and that of Tsai [10] is used to 
design heat exchanger. The installation of a wall and 
floor made of the shape-stabilized phase change 
material (SSPCM) inside building has already studied 
by the present authors [11-12]. 
 
II. PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS   
AND MODELING 
A rectangular U-shaped EAHE whose bottom is 40m 
long, 10cm wide and 10cm high and 5m deep, and 
whose sides are 5m high, 10cm wide and 10cm high on 
both sides, the thickness of all channel duct surfaces is 
10mm. (Fig. 1). The model room (with no roof) is 3.9m 
long、3.3m wide and 2.7m high. The cement layer is 
300mm thick, the layer SSPCM is 100mm thick, the 
cross sectional area of the air outlet is 100mm x 100mm, 
and the temperature below 5m below the surface of   
the ground surface is maintained at 298 K. 
1. Energy balance equations for photovoltaic and 
earth-air heat exchanger integrated greenhouse 
The energy balance equations for different components 
of a greenhouse that is combined with a photovoltaic 
(PV/T) system and an earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE) 
are as follows: (Fig. 2) 
The term qU denotes the useful thermal energy that is obtained 
from a photovoltaic (PV/T) system and Qu is the useful 
thermal energy that is obtained from an earth-air heat 
exchanger (EAHE).

III. NUMERICAL TECHNIQUE 
 
1.  Model room (with or without a roof) 
The model room (with no roof) that is used in the 
analysis is a concrete chamber with dimensions of 3.9 m 
(length) x 3.3 m (width) x 2.7 m (height). The 
dimensions of earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE) are 
given above. (Fig. 3) 
2. Input parameters of the model room and applying 
software 
In this study, Gambit was used to construct a solid 
model and grid mesh, and then Fluent was used to solve 
the flow and thermal field. Table 1 presents all 
parameters of the building and material properties of 
SSPCM. Table 2 presents the conditions of 
environments outside the model room. 
3. Establish grid cells 
Fig. 4 presents cells in the grid mesh for this model 
room (with no roof). 
Ground (4662.791 m3) ：249,885 cells 
Concrete layer (113.359 m3) ： 193,403 cells 
SSPCM layer (3.441 m3) ：136,400 cells 
Floor-wood (0.891 m3) ：7128 cells 
EAHE (0.418m3) ：3352 cells 
Air outlet (0.004 m3) ：32cells

upon after the heat exchange through EAHE, because 
the ambient temperature and EAHE temperature differ 
only slightly. Figures 6 a-d plot simulated indoor air 
temperature vs. time (YZ plane at middle X) for the 
SSPCM+ EAHE in an energy released cycle. Indoor air 
temperature does not rise but falls at t = 20 minute 
because heat is absorbed by SSPCM more slowly than 
the air-out from EAHE, but later at t = 30 minute the 
indoor air temperature reaches thermal equilibrium at 
294.42 K. 
B.  Comparison between numerical and analytical 
results for hourly variation of outdoor air temperature 
The above discussions of SSPCM concern idealized 
cases since the temperature of SSPCM was forced to be 
constant, therefore latent heat capacity causes melting or 
fusing in a short period of time, and the temperature 
difference between the average indoor temperature and 
indoor air temperature is large around 8 K to 9 K. In 
fact the average indoor temperature varies sinusoidal 
cycle with relation to optimal SSPCM temperature. The 
temperature differences between the average indoor 
temperature and indoor air temperature in both energy 
stored cycle and energy released cycle are around 2 K to 
4 K. The analytical results have been reported by Xiao 
[13]. Therefore we can compare our numerical results 
with each other based upon the hourly variation of 
outdoor air temperature in HsinChu city on one day in 
July. (the indoor air temperature is simplified equal to 
outdoor air temperature). From Fig. 7 indicates that 
numerical and analytical results are mutually consistent. 
C. Results of energy analysis 
Eq. (4) has been used for calculating greenhouse air 
temperature under weather conditions for HsinChu city 
for the following case: 
Photovoltaic is operated and earth air heat exchanger is 
operated for 24 hr for a typical summer or winter day. 
 
Hourly variation of room air temperature when operated 
with earth air heat exchanger for 24 hr (with the 
operation of photovoltaic/thermal system) for a typical 
summer day is shown in Fig 8. In this case it is seen that 
room air temperature is around 4–5 K lower than the 
ambient air temperature at 4 pm, while it is 2–3 K 
lower at 4 am, due to continuous flow of cold air from 
earth air heat exchanger to the room. 
Hourly variation of room air temperature when operated 
with earth air heat exchanger for 24 hr (with the 
operation of photovoltaic/thermal system) for a typical 
winter day is shown in Fig 9. In this case it is seen that 
room air temperature is around 3–4 K higher than the 
ambient air temperature at 1 pm, while it is 5–6 K 
higher at 5 am, due to continuous flow of hot air from 
earth air heat exchanger to the room. 
Fig. 10 shows the variation of hourly useful thermal 
energy (MJ) when operated with photovoltaic (PV/T) 
system and with earth air heat exchanger (EAHE) for a 
typical summer day. It has been observed that at 12 pm, 
useful thermal energy is calculated as 16 MJ with the 
operation of photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) system, while 
between 5 and 6 pm, the useful thermal energy 
decreases due to fall of temperature during evening. 
And useful thermal energy continuously fall down to 4 
MJ while between 3 and 4 am.  
Fig. 11 shows the variation of hourly useful thermal 
energy (MJ) when operated with photovoltaic (PV/T) 
system and with earth air heat exchanger (EAHE) for a 
typical winter day. It has been observed that at 12 pm, 
useful thermal energy is calculated as 16 MJ with the 
operation of photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) system, while 
between 4 and 5 pm, the useful thermal energy 
decreases due to fall of temperature during evening. It 
then increases to 14.5 MJ with the operation earth air 
heat exchanger during night. 
 
V. Conclusions 
This study established a close to the actual physical 
situation in a hybrid system as a whole including 
sub-systems in this new analysis. The following 
conclusions are drawn: 
(1) The hybrid system’s BIPV、TE、SSPCM heat sink 
and EAHE efficiency gains can ensure 
energy-efficiency and cleanness. They can also reduce 
the CO2 emissions. 
(2) The hybrid system has the low total input power and 
its use constitutes an active approach to energy-saving. 
(3) SSPCM consists of paraffin as dispersed PCM and 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or another material 
as a supporting material. The total stored energy is 
comparable with that of traditional PCMs. 
(4) SSPCMs of the ceiling and floor can use the same 
material, temperature range of 297 K to 300 K start 
energy stored cycle and temperature range of 289 K to 
293 K start energy released cycle. 
(5) Reducing the temperature difference between the 
ceiling and the floor to less than 4 K increases the 
comfortableness of humans. 
(6) 297 K is the most comfortable temperature in the 
HsinChu area. 
(7) The simulation results reveal that if the difference 
between the ground temperature and the ambient 
temperature is less than 5 K, such as in HsinChu 
city obtained results are unsatisfactory, so the use of 
EAHE in areas with a large temperature difference 
yields better results. 
(8) The effect of EAHE is not superimposed on additive 
with the effect of SSPCM, many parameters need to be 
considered such as materials, size and operating 
characteristics, therefore the design optimization is 
needed. 
(9)Working fluid air of EAHE may be replaced with 
water or refrigerant which has a much larger 
temperature range than air.

B.  Active building envelopes 
A brief description of the proposed ABE system is 
provided here (see Fig. 2). For more details, see [9]. The 
ABE system is comprised of two basic components: a 
photovoltaic unit (PV unit) and a thermoelectric heat 
pump unit (TE unit). The PV unit consists of 
photovoltaic cells, which are solid-state devices that 
convert solar radiation energy into electrical energy. 
The TE unit consists of thermoelectric heaters/coolers 
(referred to here onwards as TE coolers), which are 
solid-state devices that convert electrical energy into 
thermal energy, or the reverse. The PV and the TE units 
are integrated within the overall ABE enclosure. As 
shown in Fig. 2, the PV unit forms an envelope 
surrounding the external wall such that a gap is 
maintained between the wall and the PV unit. This gap 
acts as an external heat dissipation zone for the TE unit. 
The external walls of the proposed ABE system consist 
of two layers, as shown in Fig. 2.  
The author’s team; Tsai BJ [10] just finished a project; 
In a building installed the ABE system without SSPCM, 
wind、solar driven, bypass the windmill flow as a air 
flow, ambient temperature, To is equal to 308 K and 
indoor temperature, Ti is 301 K. Numerical results show 
the Ti will decrease 2 K when the ABE operating with 
heat sinks, without fan. As fan is opened, strong 
convective heat transfer, Ti will decrease approximately 
4~5 K. 
C. Hybrid system: 
Zhou et al. [11] in 2009 reported effect of 
shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM) plates 
in a building (as shown Fig. 3) combined with night 
ventilation in summer is investigated numerically. Their 
conclusions show that the SSPCM plates could decrease 
the daily maximum temperature by up to 2 K due to the 
cool storage at night. Under the present conditions, the 
appropriate values for melting temperature, heat of 
fusion, thermal conductivity and thickness of SSPCM 
plates are 26 C, 160 kJ kg-1, 0.5Wm-1 C-1 and 20 mm, 
respectively. The ACH at night needs to be as high as 
possible but the ACH at daytime should be controlled. 
II.  ANALYSIS METHOD—PHYSICAL AND 
MATHEMATIC ANALYSIS AND MODELING 
The analysis is designed to examine the indoor 
thermal comfort level under night ventilation when the 
SSPCM plates are used or not. A typical south-facing 
middle room (room A shown in Fig. 3) in a multi-layer 
building in Hsinchu city, Taiwan, is considered as the 
model room for analysis, which has only one exterior 
wall (the south wall) and others are all interior 
envelopes. The dimension of the room is assumed as 3.9 
m (length) x 3.3 m (width) x 2.7 m (height). The south 
wall is externally insulated with 60-mm-thick expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) board. There are a 2.1 m x 1.5 m 
double-glazed window and 1.5 m x 1.5 m ABE system 
in the south wall and a 0.9 m x 2 m wood door in the 
north wall which is adjacent to another room or the 
corridor. The overall heat transfer coefficients of the 
window and door are 3.01 and 0.875Wm-2 C-1, 
respectively. SSPCM plates are attached to inner 
surfaces of four walls and the ceiling as linings. Based 
on a practical consideration, no SSPCM is included in 
the floor structure. Thermo-physical properties of 
SSPCM and materials of building envelopes are shown 
in Table 1. The summer climate data is generated by the 
software Medpha [8]. A verified enthalpy model [12] is 
applied for this simulation.

turning on, or the indoor temperature is about 304 to 
307 without turning on the fan. The results show the fan 
can speed up TE cooling cold-side to spread quickly to 
the entire room.  
B. Simulated temperature results of passive SSPCM 
The energy stored in cycle is: absorption heat 
The ambient temperature is 303 K, 1atm and 
temperature of SSPCM layer is assuming a constant 
temperature 293 K, the optimal temperature (ie. 
melting/fusing temperature, and its latent capacity is 
265MJ/m3。The initial condition (t=0) of indoor air 
temperature is assuming 303 K。Fig. 10 (a~d) simulated 
indoor air temperature vs. time (YZ plane at middle X) 
for the SSPCM in an energy stored cycle. At this time, 
initially t = 0, indoor air temperature is bigger than 
temperature of SSPCM layer, then all SSPCM layers 
start to absorb heat, Numerical results show as time 
increasing and the average indoor temperature will 
decrease. The average indoor temperature from 303 K 
drops to 295.93 K within 60 minutes. It produces 
cooling effect in the daytime or say in the summer. 
Except the average indoor temperature includes 
temperatures of wall-concrete、floor-wood、floor-air、
door-wood and window-glass were tabulated in Table 4. 
On the contrary, 
The energy release in cycle is: removal heat 
The ambient temperature is 289 K, 1atm and 
temperature of SSPCM layer is assuming a constant 
temperature 303 K, the optimal time (i.e. Melting/fusing 
temperature, and its latent capacity is 265MJ/m3。The 
initial condition (t=0) of indoor air temperature is 
assuming 289 K。Fig. 11 (e~h) simulated indoor air 
temperature vs. time (YZ plane at middle X) for the 
SSPCM in an energy released cycle. At this time, 
initially t = 0, indoor air temperature is smaller than 
temperature of SSPCM layer, then all SSPCM layers 
start to release heat, Numerical results show as time 
increasing and the average indoor temperature will 
increase. The average indoor temperature from 289 K 
climbs to 298.8 K within 60 minutes. It produces 
heating effect at night time or say in the winter. Except 
the average indoor temperature includes temperatures of 
wall-concrete、floor-wood、floor-air、door-wood and 
window-glass were tabulated in Table 5. 
C.  Comparison between numerical and analytical 
results for hourly variation of outdoor air temperature 
Both of above discussions of SSPCM are idealized 
cases since the temperature of SSPCM was forced as 
constant, therefore latent heat capacity will be melting 
or fusing in a short period of time, and the temperature 
difference of the average indoor temperature will be 
large around 8 K to 9 K. In fact the average indoor 
temperature will be sinusoidal cycle with relation to 
optimal SSPCM temperature. The temperature 
differences of the average indoor temperature of both 
energy stored cycle and energy released cycle will 
around 2 K to 4 K. The analytical results have been 
reported by Xiao [16]. Therefore we can compare our 
numerical results with each other based upon hourly 
variation of outdoor air temperature in Hsin-Chu city on 
one day of July. (in here, indoor air temperature is 
simplified equal to outdoor air temperature). From Fig. 
12 shows results of numerical and analytical are pretty 
consistent with each other.    
V. CONCLUSIONS 
The above numerical results coincide with each other. 
The active ABE system; a building installed the ABE 
system wind, solar driven, bypass the windmill flow as 
a air flow, ambient temperature, is equal to 308 K and 
indoor air temperature, 301 K. Numerical results show 
the indoor air temperature will decrease 2 K when the 
ABE operating with heat sinks, without fan. As fan is 
opened, strong convective heat transfer indoor air 
temperature will decrease approximately 4 K to 5K. 
Similarly, the hybrid system integrates the passive 
SSPCM system. The temperature differences of the 
average indoor temperature of both energy stored cycle 
and energy released cycle will around 2 K to 4 K. Hence 
the hybrid system will increase the function of 
ventilation. In comparison to natural convection, COP 
increases significantly, and it is quiet 、  clean 、 
energy-saving and cost-saving. Therefore, this study 
established a closer to the actual physical situation in 
Hybrid system as a whole, including sub-systems in this 
new analysis. Several brief summary as: 
(1) The Hybrid system’s BIPV、TE、SSPCM heat sink 
efficiency gains can achieve energy-efficiency and clean. 
It can also reduce the CO2 emissions. 
(2) The Hybrid system can reduce the total input power 
and achieve proactive approach to achieve energy 
saving goals. 
(3) SSPCM consists of paraffin as dispersed PCM and 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or other materials as 
supporting material. The total stored energy is 
comparable with that of traditional PCMs. 
(4) SSPCM of ceiling and floor can use the same 
material, temperature range between 297 K to 300 K 
start energy stored cycle, and temperature range 
between 289 K to 293 K start energy released cycle. 
(5) Reduce the temperature gradient between ceiling 
and floor to under 4 K will increase the comfortableness  
of humans. 
(6) 297 K is the most comfortable temperature.

 of chips has almost no effect on thermal resistance. The 
experiment in this study does not contain heat sink 
package modules. When tens to hundreds watts from a 
high-power LED chip package module are applied, the 
condition changes and such approach is infeasible. Thus, 
analysis of LED multi-chip applications for high-power 
LED multi-chip products is necessary. Thus, this study 
simulates a model with heat sink and discusses process in 
detail. Experiments will be performed next year. 
Methods and analysis related to the application of the 
electrical method for junction temperature measurement 
applies thermal characterization of packaged 
semiconductor devices. This study is essential for anyone 
involved in the collection, interpretation, or application of 
semiconductor component thermal data, not only those in 
the LED industry but also those of developing new 
products such as high- frequency and high power devices 
with a total power dissipation of energy for a clock 
frequency of 200MHz and gate power switching 
requirement of 0.15 µW/NG/MHz [3]. Sikka, et al. 
identified the thermal and mechanical challenges of a 
multi-chip module (MCM) used in a high-end computer 
system. The chip and thermal paste carrier for an IBM 
MCM package [4]. A futuristic microprocessor package 
uses micro channels and an embedded thermoelectric 
device [5]. An innovative concept based on Advanced 
Thermal Solutions minimizes spreading resistance by 
using a Forced Thermal Spreader (FTS) in a BGA 
package [6] Along with optimizing spreading resistance, 
thermal transport must be managed to dissipate high heat 
fluxes in electronic devices. Such an example is provided 
by Colgan, et al. [7]. In their application, the chip 
operated at 400 W/cm2. Micro channels were fabricated 
inside the package, for the required cooling during chip 
operation. 
 Therefore, analysis of multi-chip applications for 
high-power multi-chip products is necessary. In Year 2007, 
Sofia [8] used of thermal resistance measurements [9-11] 
and combined methods and analysis related to application 
of the electrical method for junction temperature 
measurement to thermally characterize packaged 
semiconductor devices, including using thermal transient 
data [12-15] to build the electrical thermal resistance 
measurements for hybrids and multi-chip packages. 
However, the illuminations of LEDs vary with junction 
temperature variation due to self-heating of LEDs and 
variation of ambient temperature. Hence, the thermal 
effect will affect both illumination intensity and output 
color of LED. Masana [16] derived a RC thermal model 
for a general semiconductor package.  Muthu et al. [17] 
proposed a constant luminous model which ignores the 
thermal effect.  Farkas et al. [18] developed a thermal 
model for luminous output and thermal I resistance in 
monochromatic light-emitting unit. Huang et al. [19, 20] 
derived a system dynamics model of a luminaire to relate 
the energy input to LED junction temperature. 
 
II.   OBJECTIVES OF ANALYSIS 
First, this study focused on simulating the thermal 
resistance of an LED single-chip package, and the 
temperature distribution of an LED chip with a heat 
source on a copper plate. Error in thermal conduction of 
spherical coordinates was calculated. Then, the input 
power of this thermal resistance simulation of an LED 
single-chip package is divided into three levels, three 
various power inputs. Whether the temperature of an LED 
chip with the same position and structure as thermal 
resistance coincides with the superposition principle is 
discussed. Finally, four LED chips are arrayed at 2x2 
pitches. Only one LED chip is illuminated to calculate 
thermal resistance based on the pitch between the copper 
plates. The four LED chips undergo linear temperature 
superposition, and then compared with four simulated 
LED chip temperatures when all are illuminated to verify 
the predicted accuracy of the four LED chips at 2x2 
pitches. 
A.   Simulation of the CFdesign program 
Single-chip LED illuminated with different power 
inputs.To verify CFdesign this program, a flat copper 
plate with four edge surfaces at 25oC, top and bottom 
surfaces are insulated based upon Sofia’s hypothesis 
(LED chip as point heat source without heat sink) was 
simulated and compared with the heat transfer calculation 
using spherical coordinates. This program is feasible for 
analyzing this LED multi-chip package module problem 
(Fig. 1). To verify whether the superposition principle 
model is suitable for LED chip cases, an LED single-chip 
is input with different powers to determine whether the 
temperature distribution is linearly proportion with 
respect to distance from top to bottom. 
Multiple LEDs illuminated separately at a fixed LED 
pitch distribution.Although the package module has four 
LEDs, if the LEDs are arrayed symmetrically (Fig. 2), 
only one needs to be illuminated to determine 
temperatures of the other LEDs. The temperature 
difference between the LED chip interface and 
environment is utilized to calculate the temperature 
superposition and attain the final temperature of each chip 
when all four chips are illuminated simultaneously under 
the same power. The four chips illuminated 
simultaneously under the same power are simulated for 
verification. 
Each LED chip in the package module is heated by 
current. According to thermal conduction theory, as the 
distance of an LED chip from a neighboring LED 
increases, the temperature drop increases. That is, the 
self-heating LED chip and the thermal effects of 
neighboring LED chips determine final temperature. 
Taking the four LED chips at 2x2 pitches as an example, 
the regular matrix distance is fixed at 8mm. This distance 
is the best choice discussions related to multi-chip 
temperature. 
B.  Establishment of the finite volume model and 
hypothesis 
The CFdesign is adopted for finite element calculation 
of heat transfer. Temperature and heat flux of an LED 
chip module are also calculated. 
Structure of and material in the chip module, notably, 
LED chips sized 1mmx1mm are typically studied. A blue 
sapphire 0.1mm thick in GaN chip structure is used to 
represent the current model (Fig. 2). The top surface of 
the structure 0mm in thick is the heat source surface

 After simulating results for three LED single-chip watt 
settings, the temperature of the copper plate below the 
LED (0.8mm) minus the environment temperature of 
25oC serves as basis for reference. The 1/2-fold and 2-fold 
temperatures are added to the environment temperature to 
obtain results of copper plate temperature distributions of 
numerical simulation (by the superposition principle) and 
analytical calculation by the Eq. (8) for a LED single-chip 
package module under different powers (Fig. 8). Although 
these results may deviate by 2~7oC, estimation results still 
serve as reference. Among analysis, higher watts tend to 
result in overestimation of calculation values, because the 
temperature difference between fins of the heat sink and 
the atmosphere increases, heat dissipation increases, and 
the yielded temperature decreases to achieve thermal 
equilibrium. 
C. Thermal resistance comparison between a chip with 
and without attached soldering tin at same position 
of an LED chip 
Thermal resistance of a LED single-chip is simulated. The 
temperature differences between the LED (heat source) 
top surface and bottom surface, both attached soldering 
tin copper plate. They are consistent with calculated 
values by equations of formulas. Consequently, the 
thermal resistance yielded by equations of 1-D spherical 
coordinates is suitable for use for LED temperature 
predictions. 
D. Comparison of thermal resistance by numerical 
simulation and analytical estimation between an 
LED multi-chip 
In terms of thermal resistance of the entire LED chip 
module, the heat sink is subject to the greatest natural 
convection heat resistance R(fin-a). The four LED chip 
symmetrical case shows that if one LED chip temperature 
can be measured, the thermal resistance equation can be 
used to calculate the temperature difference between the 
chip and copper plate (Fig. 2). The thermal resistance 
value from the first LED chip luminance surface to the 
second LED chip luminance surface is calculated as 
( )( )1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2j j die bonding pitch th bonding dieR R R R R r r R R− = + + = − + +   (10) 
When the heat source of LED chips is expressed as die1, 
based on result of one of the 0.8W chips, the heat flux of 
the contact surface between the LED and resin is only 
0.0029W. This heat flux is negligible as it is too small. We 
hypothesize that all power is conducted from die1 to the 
copper plate and the thermal resistance of the pitched 
copper plate below of  the first LED chip to the copper 
plate  below  the  second  LED  chip; thus  pitchR   is   
calculated by Eq. (9). When heat is conducted to die2, the 
thermal dissipation area of this LED is negligible as it is 
too small. The heat flux shows that the attached soldering 
tin heat flux below the non-heat source LED chip is 
negligible as it is too small. Therefore, the contribution of 
this thermal resistance can be neglected. Thus, Eq. (10) is 
expressed as 
21 jjR − ≒ 1dieR ＋ 1bondingR ＋ pitchR                (11)

In this study, since the 8mm distance between two 
LED chips markedly exceeds cooper plate thickness and 
fin thickness (2.3mm), the temperature difference is 
overestimated and requires further study. In the same 
package, the interface temperature ( 1jT ) of input power of 
one LED chip is measured. Then, Eq. (11) calculates the 
four LED chips with the same simultaneous input power 
as results. The 4-fold watts greatly exceed the original 
1-fold watts. Therefore, the junction interface temperature 
difference of 20oC at 111.9oC (numerical simulation) and 
132.07oC (superposition calculation) is produced (Fig. 9). 
Although the single LED chip is overestimated, we infer 
to be attributed to the temperature difference between 
junction and heat sink. It is especially true for heat sink 
and atmospheric temperatures. The higher temperature 
difference between junction and heat sink is, the higher 
cooling efficiency will be. Therefore, the error in 
temperature calculated by superposition is related to heat 
generation of the high power. As the power increases, the 
likelihood of overestimating calculation will be. In the 
future, factors contributing to this error be examined to 
ensure accurate estimations  
In view of the above results, it shows that the thermal 
resistance of different LED chip packages varies and that 
thermal dissipation devices (copper plates and heat sinks) 
have different mechanisms, therefore, thermal dissipation 
need to be calculated separately. The Eq. (10) is used to 
calculate the thermal resistance of the LED multi-chip to 
obtain the temperature of the LED multi-chip. Eq. (10) is 
expressed in matrix below:

Thermal convection ambientfinR −   will be incorporated in the 
calculation in the future to derive accurate estimations. 
 
IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
Due to superposition of the LED multi-chip thermal 
distribution, calculation of heat dissipation becomes 
difficult. Arrangement of thermal management will likely 
increase difficult too. After systematic parameter analysis, 
we have increased knowledge of LED multi-chip package 
properties. Conclusions are summarized as follows. 
(1) Simulation results for LED chip thermal dissipation
