network coding to minimize the average access time by 
maximizing the number of demanding users for the 
dependent data items broadcasting in a multiple 
channel environment. To ensure that the encoded data 
in each time slot can be decoded by more mobile 
users, our algorithm intelligently selects the data 
items to be encoded according to the data items 
stored in users to serve the maximal number of 
demanding users. In addition, our algorithm can avoid 
coding the redundant data in each time slot to reduce 
the access time. For the dynamic environment, our 
algorithm merely adjusts the existing broadcast 
program by efficiently updating the encoding data 
sets in store statuses. These store statuses enable 
DDOP to respond to dynamic user queries immediately. 
We also conduct several experiments to verify the 
quality of DDOP in the different scenarios. Our 
experimental results showed that DDOP can 
substantially provide the high quality for not only 
in the static scenario but in the dynamic scenario. 
From our results, it was shown that the network 
coding is a promising technique to enhance data 
broadcast in a mobile computing environment.

隨著快速發展之行動通訊科技,使用者可以在任意時間及任何地點以無線行動裝置，如:筆記型電
腦，PDA 及智慧型手機來存取資訊。資料廣播是一項先進的技術，此技術可在行動資訊環境中達
到高延展性及有效使用頻寬。因此，有各式各樣的技術被設計來提供資料廣播環境中更好的服務。 
在傳統資料廣播中，伺服器在每個時間點廣播一筆資料。因此，若有使用者在同一時間點想存取
兩頻道的資料，上述限制將導致存取衝突使得使用者必須等待下一個廣播週期才能得到想要的資
料。在本計劃中，我們提出嶄新的動態資料廣播架構。在此架構，資訊系統不再是廣播單筆資料，
而是廣播混合多筆資料的編碼資料。我們根據使用者已存的資料並採用網路編碼技術使得資訊系
統可在每個時間點使資料系統能動態地將多個資料做編碼。使用者可使用已存的資料來解碼已得
到之編碼資料，進而得到需求的資料。因此，我們提出了一套演算法來動態地產生並排程編碼資
料來降低平均等待時間。 
即時要求及回應模式之資料廣播具有高延展性，因此被廣泛應用於行動計算之環境。然而，之前
在此系統之研究仍受限於每個時間點只能廣播一筆資料。此限制不但降低系統的延展性且導致較
長的等待時間。在本計劃中，我們探討如何應用網路編碼之技術來提升系統的延展性及降低平均
等待時間。為了提供即時服務及達到高延展性，我們提出即時編碼系統。有別於傳統網路編碼，
我們的方法只編碼部分資料而非所有資料。此外，編碼是根據使用者已存的資料及查詢的資料。
因此，可快速產生編碼資料且減少不必要的編碼。 
計畫英文摘要 
In this project, we have proposed a novel data broadcasting framework that adopts network coding by 
leveraging data items stored in users to reduce the average access time. In our approach, a server first 
encodes the data items in each time slot according to stored data items in mobile users and then broadcasts 
the encoding data to the mobile users. Then, the mobile users decode the encoded data by using the locally 
stored data items. Afterward, the access patterns of user queries are changed to reflect the change of their 
interest. Thus, the server adapts to the changes of user queries with the better services for users. We have 
designed an algorithm based on the network coding to minimize the average access time by maximizing the

編碼資料 d1+d2+d3，d1+2d2+d3 和 d1+d2+2d3 是線性獨立的，伺服器也產生每個編碼資料廣播係數。由於所

因此，上面的例子證明，傳統的網路編碼相對於傳統的資料廣播可以減少存取時間。但是，在資料存

圖 1 網路編碼實例 
 
 在本文中，我們首先在每一個時間段進行編碼一個子集的資料。此外，我們證明了等待時間可進一步
降低，並利用儲存在用戶的資料，來選擇資料進行編碼。考慮圖 1(d)的例子，伺服器 S 廣播 d1+d2 和 d2+d3
取代 d1+d2+d3，d1+2d2+d3 和 d1+d2+2d3。總等待時間對所有的用戶進一步減少從 10 到 7。簡短的廣播週期
會導致小的存取時間。相對於一個資料在一個時槽中的廣播週期。所提的方法考慮資料需求和存儲在
用戶資料之間的關係，為滿足更多的用戶，減少存取時間。例如，用戶 c1，c3，c5 是滿足 d1+d2 的用戶，
如圖 1(d)所示，而廣播 d3 只有滿足用戶 c3。網路編碼有利在於如果有人需要的資料存儲在另一個人，
反之亦然。因此，上述例子證明，利用存儲的資料，避免了在每個時間段重複編碼，並進一步降低了
等待時間。  
 在本文中，我們考慮動態需求為導向的編碼問題。給定一組查詢的資料和存儲在每個用戶的資料，這
 6
2.1 資料廣播  
 資料廣播是一個最有用的機制，以從一個訊息系統傳播資料到行動用戶。為了提供更好的服務的行動
用戶端，大量的研究工作都集中在發展混合資料廣播 [1] [20] [24]，要求廣播 [2] [4] [22]，和資料廣播 [2] 
[21] [46]。由於有限的電力和頻寬，一些研究成果開發節約能源和通信頻寬，如行動資料傳播[7]，能源
效率的索引[9]，有效頻寬分配[45]。上述應用，資料廣播是為廣播流行的資料以降低功耗，延遲時間，
頻寬和高可擴展性。  
 以上討論的研究假設每個用戶在同一時間只需要一個資料，每個需求是獨立的。更具體地說，對於每
個用戶，該用戶需要一個資料在第 i 個要求的存取頻率是預先確定。然而，在許多實際應用中要求多
個資料。例如，行動用戶在同一時間想知道谷歌，微軟和英特爾股票價格。因此，伺服器資料與獨立
的要求是不能夠有效地最佳化廣播排程效能。這種情況，有許多的研究工作致力於解決相關資料廣播
問題。更具體地說，用戶發出一組查詢，每一組查詢中包含了一組相關資料。因此，這種現象以一個
相關查詢集為模型。有兩種類型的相關資料查詢：一為有序查詢，另一種是無序查詢。順序查詢中，
所需的資料是按照預定的順序。視頻資料流就是這個例子。另一方面，無序查詢的所需資料沒有一定
順序。相對於有序的查詢，這些資料所需的資料可以任意排序。在氣象訊息廣播系統，行動用戶查詢
國家的天氣訊息沒有預設順序。 
 資料廣播可分為三個屬性：一個是數位廣播頻道（即單頻道 [10] [36]，多頻道[21] [28]），另一個是順
序資料廣播查詢（即有序查詢[28]和無序查詢 [10] [21] [36]），另一個是資料複製 [6] [23]。QEM[10]廣
播排程以盡量減少平均等待時間。基因演算法[21]是基於基因概念[16]設計的多頻道資料廣播環境。在
[28]查詢被假定為命令。[23]提出了一個啟發式演算法來產生廣播排程而設計的複製資料。此外，節能
調度問題，[43]提出了兩個演算法，在平行頻道設計資料檢索之存取模式。 
2.2 網路編碼  
 在訊息傳遞環境，網路編碼已被證明是一個很先進的機制，以提高 throughput[3] [13] [14] [15]。在[39]
中，作者證明，網路編碼可以利用可用網路頻寬有效傳播通信。而不是簡單地轉發資料，中間節點編
碼輸入幾個資料包到一個輸出資料包，每個編碼的資料包的線性組合的原始輸入資料包。相對於傳統
的方法，有效地利用網路資源，並以最小的計算需求增加網路效能。  
 我們描述了網路編碼與它的數學概念如下。我們假定 N 是封包個數，P1,P2,…PN 為封包。線性網路編
碼[39]，每一個資料包的線性組合與一個資料序列係數 C1,C2,…,CN,在場 2S（也就是說，如果 S = 1，Ci= 
0 或 1）內。場包含有限的許多內容。該場的大小 Pk，其中 P 是質數，k 是一個正整數。例如，有一個
場的大小 2，為 0 或 1。因此，我們可以得到一個線性方程 E（即 E =ΣCiPi）。對於第 j 個符號 E 和 Pi，
Ej=ΣCiPi,j。例如，給定 1 位元符號，場大小為 2（即 0 或 1），運算子+成為 XOR。我們定義的係數
C1,C2,…,CN 的編碼作為向量，E 是訊息向量[14]。此外，我們假設一個節點集{C1,E1},{C1,E2},…,{C1,EN}，
要解決一個節點的線性方程 Ej（即，Ej =ΣCiPi,j），其中未知的變數是 Pi,j。這個線性方程有 n 個方程和
N 未知數。如果 n 大於 N，N 方程的方程組是線性獨立的，我們可以恢復原始資料。也就是說，收集
 8
碼資料，1≦j≦L 和 1≦i≦nc。假設行動用戶 u1 存儲的資料集合 Si 包括資料 B 和 K（即 S1=（B，K）），
和行動用戶 u1 查詢的資料集合 Q1 包括資料 A 和 D（也就是說 Q1=（A，D））。用戶 u1 在時間 0 到達。
因此，用戶 u1 可以從解碼 e1,1 和 e2,1 獲取所有資料。然而，由於 e1,1 和 e2,1 位於同一時段如圖 2 所示。行動
用戶 u1 必須先取得 e1,1，然後等待一個廣播週期，即可得到編碼 e2,1。因此，這個例子 rt１＝1，因為用戶
u1 下載 e2,1 要等待一個廣播週期。  
 另一方面，假設行動用戶 u2 存儲資料集合 S2 包括資料 C（即 S2={C}），和行動用戶 u2 查詢的資料集合
Q2 包括資料 G（也就是說 Q2={G}）。用戶 u2 到達時段 1，編碼資料 e1,3 是滿足用戶需要。u2 在一個廣播
週期要等待兩個時槽來存取編碼資料 e1,3（即 rt2= 2），cycle2 是 0。■  
 定義 3（平均存取時間）：z 和 b 分別表示每個資料和每個廣播頻道的頻寬。平均存取時間如下：  
在上面的例子，平均存取時間 AAT=3z/b（即 AAT=([(1+3）×(z/b)]+[(2+0)×（z/b)]）/2)。  
我們定義本文考慮的問題如下。  
 定義 4（動態需求為導向編碼問題）：給定用戶 ui 存儲的資料集 Si 和查詢的資料集 Qi，其中 1≦i≦nu，
問題是在每個時段的每個頻道選擇資料進行編碼資料，以盡量減少平均存取時間。  
4 廣播排程  
4.1 編碼資料頻道分配演算法  
 我們的演算法 DDOP（動態需求為導向配對編碼）包含兩個階段，最初的編碼和自適應編碼，以減少
平均等待時間。第一階段的初始編碼產生的編碼資料為每個頻道在每個時段根據資料存儲和查詢最大
化滿足用戶的數量。隨後，在自適應編碼階段，如果用戶更改任何資料，DDOP 根據新的查詢和存儲
的資料調整現有的編碼。  
 具體來說，我們的演算法決定了一套編碼資料，以最大化任何一個時段的頻道增加服務用戶數量。DDOP
包括兩個階段找到 nc 的雙碼次數，以最大化提高要求的用戶。在第一階段，DDOP 發現 nc 個雙碼最大
化數量的用戶。在第二階段，DDOP 精進上述 nc 個雙碼，多次更換任何一個雙碼與另一雙編碼的數量
最大化要求的用戶。隨後，DDOP 擴展這些雙碼成多碼，考慮更多的資料存儲在每個用戶的數目增加
用戶的要求。在伺服器開始廣播編碼資料，我們的演算法需要考慮狀態改變及用戶需求來為下一個時
槽確定編碼資料集。基本概念是修改現有的編碼資料，而不是重新啟動一個新的程序產生編碼資料。
要調整現有的廣播排程，我們存儲和處理資料的編碼表。因此，我們的演算法只是更新了編碼表，而
不是重新產生編碼表來獲取編碼集。  
 編碼和解碼演算法很簡單，但在 DDOP 比傳統演算法更有效和更有用。具體來說，傳統的演算法找出
最佳的資料編碼。對於高速應用，如視頻流，這些編碼和解碼演算法，導致效益下降的瓶頸。 DDOP
具有線性時間編碼解碼和線性時間複雜度，並表現出良好的效能。我們特別描述了兩個階段如下。

 例 2：給定 6 項 d1，d2，d3，d4，d5，d6 和用戶 uj（1≦j≦nu），用戶 uj 的已存儲資料集 Sj 和查詢資料集
Qj 如圖 3(a)所示。DDOP 首先從 6 個資料隨機選擇兩個不同的資料產生雙編碼，然後存儲雙編碼 DT.Ei。
因此，DT 有 15 個雙編碼（即，1≦i≦15）。下一步，根據在每個用戶資料查詢和存儲的資料，DDOP
認定要求用戶雙編碼 DT.Ei，然後將要求用戶存儲在 DT.Ui。例如，DDOP 插入用戶 u2 到 DT.Ui 因為 u2
以存儲的資料集合 S2 的資料 d3 從解碼雙碼 DT.E2（d1，d3）接收在查詢的資料集合 Q2 的查詢資料 d1。 DDOP
重複上述步驟，以找到滿足用戶的每雙編碼，直到所有用戶都滿足如圖 3(b)所示。 ■ 
 
 由於每個用戶無法從兩個頻道在同一時段接收兩個編碼，我們分別在每個時槽為 nc 個頻道尋找 nc 個編
碼資料 E1,t，．．．，Enc,t。請注意，我們以聯集 nc 個編碼資料所滿足的用戶個數，而不是直接加總。原
因是用戶在任何交集的兩組用戶在兩個不同的頻道在同一時間不能存取任何兩個資料編碼。暴力演算
法徹底找所有可能組合 nc 個雙碼以最大化用戶數量。然而，這種做法的結果是在一個高度複雜，由於
找出大量不必要的組合。相反的，DDOP 包括兩個階段找到雙編碼。在第一階段，DDOP 在步驟 1-7 發
現 nc 個初始雙碼。在第二階段，DDOP 精進 nc 個雙碼，多次更換任何一個 nc 個雙碼與另一雙編碼，達
到最大化的用戶數量。有關詳情如下。  
 為了最大化要求用戶數目，DDOP 產生 nc 個編碼資料。對於每一個雙碼，步驟 1-7 合併一個雙編碼到
一個編碼資料集使最大化要求用戶數目，直到雙碼的編碼資料集達到 nc 個。具體來說，第 3 步首次在
DT 發現雙碼 DT.Ek，以最大化提高用戶數量。其次，第 7 步存儲 DT.Ek 為 E1,t，其中 Et 的收集 nc 個雙碼，
將在時間槽 t 播出，Ei,t 是在 Et 第 i 個編碼資料。請注意，伺服器中的資料 Ei,t 是以 XOR 運算混合資料，
然後播放編碼的資料。此外，第 7 步在 Us 儲存雙編碼 Ei,t 的要求用戶。隨後，DDOP 使用此編碼找到另
 12
可以考慮更多存儲在用戶的資料和更多的查詢的資料。 
例 3：由於雙代碼集 E₁（即（d1,d5），（d2,d6））在時槽 1 不能滿足所有用戶，DDOP 在 E₁擴展了雙
碼成多碼，以增加要求的用戶。DDOP 增加了數項資料進行編碼 E1,1 和 E2,1，直到要求用戶不能進一
步增加。具體來說，首先 DDOP 在 E₁'記錄 E₁以前的狀況，其中 n 是在 UDT₁的紀錄數量（n=22）。 
DDOP 增加了第三個資料 d₂到 E1,1（d1,d5）在 E₁'中成為（d1,d5,d2）。隨後，DDOP 存儲編碼資料集
（（d1,d5,d2），（d₂,d₆））在 UDT₁.E₂₃，存儲要求用戶在 UDT₁.U₂₃。圖 4（b）中，DDOP 重複
上述步驟以添加更多的資料到（d1,d5），如圖 4（a）所示第 1 行至第 4 行。但是，DDOP 不會在 E₁取
代 E1,1（d1,d5）與任何多碼延長至（d1,d5）由於沒有增加用戶數量。 
 隨後，DDOP 重複上述步驟在 E₁'添加第三資料到 E2,1（（d₂,d₆））如圖 4(a)所示由第 5 列到第 8 列。
如圖 4(a)所示第 27 項至 30 項。如圖 4（b），在這種情況下，DDOP 在 E₁以多碼（d2,d4,d6）取代 E2,1
（（d₂,d₆））（即 E₁=（（d1,d5），（d2,d4,d6））比 E₁'（即 E'=（（d1,d5），（d₂,d₆）增加更多用戶）。圖 4
（b）,也就是說，|DEM（d1,d5）∪DEM（d₂,d₆）|小於|DEM（d1,d5）∪DEM（d2,d4,d6）|。請注意，
DDOP 不會在 E₁添加第四個資料到（d2,d4,d6），由於要求用戶數量不能再增加。最後，DDOP 在時段
1 分配 d1+d5 和 d2+d4+d6 到兩個頻道，然後在 E₁插入 E1,1 和 E2,1。 ■

5.實驗結果 
 在本節中，我們進行一些實驗，以評估效能 DDOP。目前沒有相關的資料廣播與網路編碼方面之研究。
因此，我們與以前的研究[21] [26]比較我們的演算法。[21]基於基因演算法[16]來排程每個資料。MULS [26]
以更多的查詢優先排程，以避免存取衝突。此外，我們的實驗比較對向還包括傳統的線性編碼法
LC[38]，LC 編碼所有資料，而 DDOP 根據查詢和存儲的資料只選擇較少的資料來編碼。為了便於比較，
我們還設計了一個暴力演算法 BF 徹底找所有可能組合 nc 個編碼資料，以最大化用戶數目。

property that data have not been altered in an unauthorized
manner), the Global System for Mobile Communications
(GSM) compatibility, and mutual authentication (i.e., the
provision of assurance of the claimed identity of two enti-
ties). The integrity algorithm (KASUMI) [9] uses a 128-bit
key and generates a 64-bit MAC. Detailed descriptions of
the 3G authentication procedure can be found in [9].
Therefore, our secure framework indeed provides a robust
data transmission for mobile users handing over between
3G and WiFi networks.
The proposed protocol can provide conﬁdentiality,
authentication, and mechanism to refresh shared secret
materials. Moreover, the protocol can also defend the
man-in-the-middle attack and session hijack. It easily
achieves the goal of mutual authentication with the suppli-
cant and the AP. Additionally, we use it in the integration
of WLAN and 3G, and we propose a seamless handover
security protocol. One situation is that the 802.11 WLAN
users hand over to the 3G environment. The 3G authentica-
tion procedure [9] is used to providing authentication and
key agreement. Afterward, we will have a secure commu-
nication and roaming.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
gives the preliminaries. In Section 3.1, we develop a secure
protocol AKEP to protect data transmission in the handoff
from 3G to 802.11 WLAN. In Section 3.2, we develop a
3G authentication procedure to protect data transmission
in the handoff from 802.11 WLAN to 3G. The experimen-
tal results are presented in Section 4. Finally, this paper
concludes with Section 5.
2. PRELIMINARIES
2.1. Related works
The integration of 802.11 WLAN and 3G is more and
more popular because they will have mutual advantage be-
tween WLAN and cellular. Because of the shared media
characteristic of this environment, transmitted messages
can be intercepted easily. This means that privacy data
may be compromised while handing over in this environ-
ment. Choi et al. [12] proposed a seamless handoff scheme
to perform pre-registration and pre-authentication pro-
cesses before the handoff. In addition, it adopts packet
buffering and forwarding functions to mitigate packet loss
during the handoff period. Varma [13] remedied a mobility
management by using the different levels of control and in-
teraction for integrated UMTS and WLAN. Moreover, Liu
et al. [14] proposed a tight coupling interworking architec-
ture for integrated UMTS and WLAN. This method routes
the signaling according to the original tight coupling to
preserve the network security. On the basis of IPv6, Mo-
bile IP, and Fast Handoff techniques, Liu et al. [15] also
proposed hybrid coupling with radio access system for in-
tersystem communications and vertical handoff manage-
ment in UMTS and WLAN. The proposed algorithms
can dynamically distribute trafﬁc and reduce signaling cost
and handoff latency among the internetworking networks.
Kambourakis et al. [16] proposed Extensible Authentica-
tion Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) authen-
tication mechanisms for integrated 3G and WLAN. The
proposed EAP-TLS combines public key infrastructure to
overcome inefﬁciencies in the existing UMTS-WLAN en-
vironment. Lampropoulos et al. [17] studied the most re-
cent handover management architectures for integrated
UMTS and WLAN. They surveyed various related propo-
sals in main characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages
for integrated UMTS and WLAN.
The WLAN security standard for this issue is in 802.11,
called Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP) [8,18]. This pro-
tocol uses RC4 [19,20] as encryption/decryption engine
and uses CRC-32 to ensure the integrity of transmitted
data. The WEP [21] also proposed an authentication proto-
col, called Shard Key Authentication, to achieve the goal
of authentication. However, recent studies show many
ﬂaws discovered in WEP. According to this study, WEP
does not attain the goals of authentication and conﬁdential-
ity. Later, IEEE proposed a new wireless security standard,
called 802.1X [7], to resolve the ﬂaws in the WEP in the
802.11. The 802.1X introduced a new element, called au-
thentication server (RADIUS) [22], to provide authentica-
tion service. In 802.1X, only authorized supplicants can
use the service provided by APs, and the AP can verify
the requesting supplicant by asking RADIUS server for au-
thentication service. Nevertheless, in 2002, Mishra and
Arbaugh found some drawbacks from 802.1X. The main
problem is no mutual authentication between supplicants
and APs.
Many of the security enhancements required to 2G sys-
tems are intended to counteract attacks that were not per-
ceived to be feasible in 2G systems. The newest IEEE
wireless security draft is 802.11i based on 802.1X.
802.11i adopts EAP [23] to authenticate users and to gen-
erate a dynamic layer-two session key. Note that in
802.11i, the Advanced Encryption Standard [24] to substi-
tute RC4 and a more complex key derivation mechanism to
ensure that the session key does not be reused. Q3The users
use the session key to encipher data and to create message
integrity. 802.11i also provides a robust authentication
scheme based on 802.1X.
2.2. System architecture
We assume that a mobile station (MS) Q4is a dual-mode ter-
minal with two interfaces: a 3G interface and an 802.11
WLAN interface. We also assume that an AP includes a
RADIUS server and AR Q5function as shown in Figure F11.
The 802.11 WLAN users can use data connection (UMTS
packet-switched (PS) Q6service), and the 3G users can use
voice connection (UMTS circuit-switched Q7service). Note
that in this paper, 3G is conforming to an UMTS standard.
The two interfaces can autoswitch in the different system.
Figure 1 shows the architecture where serving general
packet radio service (GPRS) support node (SGSN) is the
integration point [25]. The radio network controller

Although 3GPP standard [26] adopts the symmetric key
to defeat the attacks, Zhang et al. [27] pointed out that this
standard has two fatal weaknesses on the key authentica-
tion. One is that HLR does not verify whether the informa-
tion sent from the SGSN is valid or not because the
standard assumes the reliable link between SGSN and
HLR. The other is that integrity key is transmitted without
any encryption and the user data are not protected under
the UMTS integrity protection mechanism. In addition,
Zhang et al. [28] showed that the 3GPP standard allows
an adversary to redirect user trafﬁc from one network to
another and reuse corrupted authentication vectors from
one network to all other networks. Zhang et al. thereby
proposed protocol AP-AKA to remedy these problems in
the 3GPP standard. However, Juang et al. [29] indicated
that AP-AKA suffers from two main weaknesses in key
authentication and agreement. One is a location privacy at-
tack while MS is receiving an identity request at location
updating.Q10 The other is that distributing authentication vec-
tors to visitor’s location register (VLR) for authenticating
MS leads to higher bandwidth consumption and vector
storage overhead between HLR and VLR.
In summary, the symmetric-key authentications are efﬁ-
cient in computation for wireless networks, whereas they
generally require complicated key management with large
storage and communication overhead. Instead, the public-
key authentications can be more effective in terms of the
storage usage and security resilience. In addition, the
public-key-based authentications can achieve simple key
managements. Moreover, Gura et al. [30] showed that the
public-key authentications are feasible for generic mobile
devices without any special hardware. Therefore, we adopt
the public-key authentication to overcome the above secu-
rity weaknesses on the key authentication and agreement
included in [26,28].
In general, there are two types of architectures that
could resolve the wireless security problems. The ﬁrst type
is “Supplicant Authenticator” mode, in which a supplicant
and an AP have to negotiate a shared secret to authenticate
each other and protect the link after. The advantage of this
mode is implemented easily, but the AP has a heavier load
(needs extra memory to store supplicants’ privacy data and
extra CPU time to deal with authentication services). The
second type is “Supplicant Authenticator Authentication
Server” mode, which the authentication server performs
the trusted third party. That is, any two untrustful parties
can authenticate each other through asking authentication
services from the authentication server. Obviously, authen-
tication servers can decrease the load of the AP and bal-
ance the network trafﬁc. We assume that AP includes
RADIUS services. Therefore, AP can provide certiﬁcation
and authentication.
3.1.1. Initial phase.
In this phase, an MS registers itself as a legal member
through an AP online as shown in FigureF3 3. The reason
for choosing an OTP is that it varies per session, the length
of the OTP is long enough compared with a human-chosen
password, and it is hard to trace and detect. Note that
Counter is a positive integer and will be decreased by
one after each successful connection. When it decreases
to zero, the MS should reinitialize its OTP. The value of
Counter cannot exceed the number of iterations of
OTPs [31]. The details are described as follows.
Step 1: The supplicant sends an initialization message
to the AP that wants to register itself.
Step 2: When an AP receives an initialization message,
it sends its public key KP, challenge text, and
the certiﬁcate of the public key, Cert(KP), to
the supplicant. The Cert(KP) is signed by a
trusted party, and each one can verify KP,
which is owner’s information.
Step 3: The supplicant veriﬁes Cert(KP). If this certiﬁ-
cate is valid, supplicant will use challenge text
and user’s secret pass-phrase to generate an
OTP [31]. OTP1 concatenates the counter of
OTP1, his certiﬁcate Cert(Supplicant), and
MAC (e.g., MACKP Counter½  ), and they are
encrypted with KP. The supplicant sends the
encrypted packet to the AP. For example, if
Counter is 2, OTP1 will be equal to HASH
[HASH[pass-phrase, challenge text]].
Step 4: The AP checks the MAC and veriﬁes Cert
(Supplicant). If the certiﬁcate and the MAC are
valid, the supplicant will send a new ID to the AP.
For the authentication and the integrity of sent packets
to be ensured, a MAC is added to packets, and the receiver
should check it. Counter cannot exceed the number of
iterations of OTP. For example, if the number of iterations
of OTP is 1000, the max value of Counter is 999.

3.2.2. Secure analysis for Adaptive Key
Exchange Protocol.
We show that AKEP can achieve secure protection for
users as the handoff from 3G to WLAN. We ﬁrst evaluate
the secure performance of the AKEP using several secure
criteria. We select these criteria from secure requirements
deﬁned in 3GPP. Note that EAP method for UMTS au-
thentication and key agreement (EAP-AKA) [33] is an
EAP for authentication and session key distribution with
UMTS Subscriber Identity Module (USIM).
We prove that AKEP indeed provides a secure data
transmission in the handoff from 3G to WLAN as follows.
Statement 1. AKEP can avoid key reuse generated
by exhausting initial vectors (IVs).
Proof. AKEP generates a session key using a unique
privacy value without any duplication. Because of session
key generation without the duplication of IVs, AKEP can
avoid key reuse. ■
Statement 2. AKEP extends the lifetime of the
shared secret channel with Counter.
Proof. Because AKEP mainly protects the communica-
tion channel with OTP, the life time of the secret channel is
Counter. AKEP adopts a unique OTP to protect each
session and ensures the unique OTP with Counter.■
Statement 3. With the use of AKEP, every communi-
cation will generate a different session key.
Proof. Because AKEP generates each session key by
using OTP, one session key is different from another for
each session. ■
Statement 4. AKEP has strong mutual authentication
based on OTP to avoid a man-in-the-middle attack.
Proof. MSs and an AP authenticate each other with
their own OTP at each session. Because the MSs and the
AP can generate their own OTP, OTP provides mutually
authentication for two parties. ■
Statement 5. Safely refreshing shared materials: each
new shared element will be protected by a similar key ex-
change procedure.
Proof. AKEP uses E _ Sym to protect the procedure of
password refreshing with secret session key KT. This is be-
cause attackers cannot obtain session key KT without OTP
and Counter.■
Statement 6. AKEP is compatible with any cipher
algorithms because any cipher algorithms can use a session
key to cipher message data.
Proof. AKEP adopts symmetric encryption E _ Sym
with session key KT to protect data transmission. We can
use any symmetric encryption algorithms to perform E _ Sym
without any limitations. ■
Statement 7. AKEP can be used on any client-server
wireless and wired environments.
Proof. Because AKEP is a two-party secure scheme, it
can be applied to any client-server systems. ■
Statement 8. AKEP protects an AP from denial of ser-
vice (DoS) attacks and session hijack attacks because every
message frame includes a MAC with dynamic session key.
Proof. For each data transmission, AKEP adopts Hash
function to generate a MAC. Because OTP is part of
MAC, MAC can provide mutually authentication to pro-
tect an AP from DoS and session hijack attacks. ■
Statement 9. AKEP is secure against passive attacks
(eavesdropping/replay attacks) based on replaying cap-
tured reusable session keys because every counter number
has its own session key.
Proof. With Counter, AKEP ensures the effects of key
reuses. This is because AKEP generates a session key with
OTP. Therefore, each Counter corresponds to an individ-
ual session key. ■

good for one authentication and key agreement between
the SGSN and the user service identity module (USIM)Q12 [9].
When the SGSN initiates an authentication and key agree-
ment, it selects the next authentication vector from the ordered
array and sends the parameters RAND and AUTN to the user.
Authenticationvectors inaparticularnodeareusedonaﬁrst-in/
ﬁrst-out basis. The USIM checks whether AUTN can be
accepted and, if so, produces a response RES that is sent back
to the SGSN. The USIM also computes CK and IK. The
SGSN compares the received RES with XRES. The USIM
veriﬁes that the received sequence number SQN is in the
correct range. If they match, the SGSN considers the authenti-
cation and key agreement exchange to be successfully com-
pleted. The established keys CK and IK will then be
transferred by the USIM and the VLR/SGSN to the entities
that perform ciphering and integrity functions. In addition,
the USIM and the HLR keep track of counters SQNMS and
SQNHLR, respectively, to support network authentication.
The sequence number SQNHLR is an individual counter for
each user, and the sequence number SQNMS denotes the
highest sequence number the USIM has accepted [9]. The
3G authentication procedure has following features:
(1) Using an encryption key shared by a group of users
to protect the user’s identity.
(2) Message authentication and replay inhibition have
not been suppressed by an attacker.
(3) Integrity protection of critical signaling messages
protects against DoS attacks.
(4) The use of temporary identities counteracts passive
identity catching attacks.
(5) A sequence number in the challenge allows the
USIM to verify the freshness of the cipher key.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we conduct several experiments to inspect
the performance of our scheme implemented in C++. The
experimental results show that our secure protocol can pro-
vide a secure key exchange and mutual authentication in
the 3G–WLAN environment. In addition, we also analyze
the computational complexity and communication latency
of the proposed secure protocol in the 3G–WLAN
environment.
4.1. Security analysis
In Figure F88, we compare our protocol with EAP-AKA [33]
and EAP-SIM [34]. Note that EAP-AKA is an EAP mech-
anism for authentication and session key distribution for a
3G system. If the protocol can satisfy the requirement for a
secure criterion, the grade is one. Otherwise, the grade is
zero. The secure grade obtained from the grade points sum-
marized from the several criteria indicates the improve-
ments for AKEP. That is, the secure improvements
increase with the grade points. AKEP can achieve more ro-
bust secure data transmission for the heterogeneous wire-
less networks as compared with EAP-AKA. We
speciﬁcally analyze each secure criterion as follows.
4.1.1. Initial vector.
Initial vector is especially used to examining the
method for the key generation of the algorithm. In WEP,
the RC4 algorithm is used for the encryption and decryp-
tion. The key generation in the RC4 is used some initial
vectors which is negotiated in advance so that it must
choose the longer key for the expected strength of the
security. Q13For this reason, the attackers analyze and receive
all keys used in the operation if they knew the IVs in ad-
vance. A generated method of keys relied on IVs is inse-
cure. AKEP adopts an OTP system for generating the
session keys to release the public key for the AP. Although
the RC4 algorithm is used as the symmetric cipher algo-
rithm, there is no IV problem because of the different gen-
erated method of the keys. The algorithms of the EAP-SIM
and EAP-AKA also generate the keys without the IV.

user can arbitrarily deny the requests, the server cannot
manage the related data and cannot charge for the service.
In the initialization phase of the AKEP, according to the
property of the asymmetrical algorithm, public key Kp of
the AP is different from the others. There is the certiﬁcate
of the key from the trusted third party. When the public key
is announced, the certiﬁcate must be delivered together.
The MS veriﬁes the certiﬁcate from the trusted third party.
With this reason, the AP cannot deny its service encrypted
with the Kp. The MS transmits his ID with the certiﬁcate at
each communication session. At the received party, the AP
can verify the certiﬁcate from the third party, which pub-
lishes the certiﬁcate. Therefore, the MS and the AP cannot
repudiate each other in the communication session of the
AKEP. EAP-SIM adopts the properties of the hardware,
and the data embedded in each SIM card are distinct. The
text of the SIM card is stored in a valid server. Therefore,
the MS and the AP cannot repudiate each other in the com-
munication session with EAP-SIM.
4.1.9. Plain ID transmission.
In AKEP, the MS uses the valid key from the AP to en-
crypt his identiﬁcation and his certiﬁcate in the beginning
of the authentication process. In the refresh password
phase, the identiﬁcation is encrypted by the dynamic ses-
sion key. Each dynamic session key is different at each ses-
sion. Therefore, the eavesdroppers cannot hijack the
identiﬁcation. Because the identities of EAP-SIM and
EAP-AKA are exposed, EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA are
vulnerable.
4.1.10. Data integrity.
Date integrity is to ensure that the transmitted data are not
modiﬁed by eavesdroppers. AKEP uses MAC to guarantee
the integrity of each communication session. AT_MAC pro-
vides integrity for EAP-SIM, but it cannot protect the begin-
ning and ending communication session of the EAP-SIM.
EAP-AKA has AT_MAC and AT_CHECKCODE to per-
form data integrity based on a key-based MAC. However,
AT_MAC cannot protect privacy ID, and AT_CHECKCODE
is an optional function. Therefore, EAP-AKA cannot
provide robust data integrity during data transmission.
4.1.11. Entity authentication.
Entity authentication explores the authentication
mechanisms in secure protocols. AKEP adopts certiﬁcate
Cert to complete mutual authentication for each peer,
where Cert is an asymmetric cipher algorithm. EAP-SIM
is based on the information in a SIM card to complete mu-
tual authentication. Note that the card includes some per-
manents for authentication.
4.1.12. Summary of secure analysis.
Adaptive Key Exchange Protocol adopts the concept of
the virtual privacy network to enhance the security level.
AKEP builds up a virtual tunnel between the MS and AP
in the wireless networks. EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA are
not tunneling methods and suffer from vulnerable
problems from EAP-based methods. These problems im-
pose restrictions on the security deployment of the EAP-
SIM and EAP-AKA. Although there are some complex
solutions to enhance the secure protocol, such as PEAP,
they become complicated and inefﬁcient for real-time mo-
bile authentication systems.
4.2. Performance analysis
We conduct several experiments to evaluate the perfor-
mance of AKEP and EAP-AKA. We assume that the hand-
off rate is uniform distribution between 10% and 50% in
all mobile users. We ﬁrst investigate the latency for two
schemes, where the latency is average time elapsed in all
secure procedures. Figure F99 shows that AKEP results in
lower latency and thereby surpasses EAP-AKA in an aver-
age of 46%. This is because AKEP can fast authenticate
mobile users with fewer messages and can effectively gen-
erate keys with concise procedures. Additionally, AKEP
fast obtain new keys based on its own trusted OTP without
other complex re-key procedures. However, EAP-AKA
has a lot of unnecessary procedures to authenticate mobile
users and to manage keys. Therefore, this experiment
shows that AKEP indeed achieve secure data transmission
for large-scale wireless networks. On the other hand, to
evaluate the computational overhead, we calculate the
number of hash functions, enciphers and deciphers used
in two approaches. Q19Figure F1010 shows that AKEP is superior
to EAP-AKA in an average of 34%. The reason is that
AKEP can efﬁciently authenticate mobile users and fast
generates key without complex calculation and procedures.
Therefore, as compared with EAP-AKA, AKEP substan-
tially provides a practical and effectively secure protocol
to protect privacy data transmission with higher conﬁdence
and lower burdens in the insecure wireless network.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a secure handoff scheme for in-
tegration of 3G and 802.11 WLAN networks. To prevent
user privacy from intuited eavesdropping and spooﬁng, a

the broadcast program between the information system and
the downlink channel. To retrieve the 3D data on the air, the
mobile users receive index information preceding each 3D data
when arriving at the system and then wait until the interest data
appear. The server can model the access frequency for each 3D
data by collecting access patterns from the mobile users [8].
Note that the information system provides an uplink channel
so that the server can collect access patterns from the mobile
users. Without loss of generality, we assume in this paper that
each 3D data is of different size. Therefore, our architecture
can allow the mobile users to conveniently access the 3D data
in the real broadcasting environment.

C. Analytical Model
In the 3D data scheduling, we modify the log-time algo-
rithm [7] based on Vtxduh-urrw Uxoh generating a broadcast
program to broadcast the popular 3D data of small sizes
more frequently in a broadcast cycle. According to Square-
root Rule, we can achieve minimum overall waiting time
when spacing vl of each data gl is proportional to its size
}l and inversely proportional to its access frequency il (i.e.,
vl b
q

il ). Note that the spacing refers to the number of time
slots between two instances of the same 3D data, and can also
be viewed as a broadcast interval of the same 3D data. Assume
that 3D data g1> g2> ===,gP are broadcast via a channel> and
a user receives index information when arriving at a system.
Let zw represent the average waiting time of retrieving the 3D
data. To retrieve the 3D data, the user ¿rst tunes the channel
and then waits for the 3D data of interest to appear on the
channel. We provide an analytical model for indexing the 3D
data in the channel as follows. Given vl, which is the interval

Due to the scarce network bandwidth, information systems
cannot directly transmit large scale in the 3D data. To ef-
fectively transmit the 3D data on the broadcast channel, we
¿rst partition the whole 3D data set into 64 elements in a
sequence as shown in Fig 2. Note that these elements are
called voxels. These voxels need to be indexed for indicating
the spatial location in the 3D data since users may view the
3D data in different angles. We propose TDI based on the
modi¿ed octree [6] to index these voxels as shown in Fig. 3.
Speci¿cally, the modi¿ed octree recursively divides the 3D
data into eight octants until the user-speci¿ed octree level
is reached. Note that in this paper, we adopt two levels in
the octree for simplicity, and Fig. 3 shows two-level octree
partitioning results. Fig. 3 indicates the index data structure
of TDI. Considering Fig. 3 as an example, Fig. 4 presents the
indices and voxels allocated in the broadcast channel.
We discuss the index structure of the octree as follows. Root
index L appears at the ¿rst index segment. Therefore, users can
receive L at the ¿rst arrival. 3D data index El indicates the
l-th 3D data gl, where 0  l P  1> and P is the number
of the broadcast 3D data. To avoid missing key indices, our
approach duplicates L and El in each index segment as shown
in Fig. 4. The ¿rst level voxel index Elm represents the index
of the m-th voxels of the ¿rst partitioned level of the l-th 3D
data in the octree, where 0  l P  1 and 0  m  7= The
second level voxel index Elmn denotes the index of the n-th
voxels from the m-th voxel of the l-th 3D data in the octree and
points to the ¿nal divided voxel glmn, where 0  l P  1,
0  m  7> and 0  n  7=
We discuss index structures and other auxiliary information
in an index segment to facilitate searching required 3D data
for users. Each index sub-segment contains pointers pointing
to other sub-segments containing its child index nodes. These
pointers are referred to as local indices [5]. Considering Figs.
3 and 4 as an example, each index sub-segment containing
index node L has a local index pointing at two sub-segments
containing index nodes E0 and E1 respectively. Since users
arriving at a server in any time may not receive the index of the
requested 3D data, more auxiliary information is used to direct
the users to other sub-segments containing their required 3D
data. To solve the above problem, we introduce a control index
[5] composing of pointers pointing at the next occurrence
of a sub-segment containing the parent index nodes of the
current index node. Since 3D data size is non-uniform, there
is a sub-segment in the index segment to store the interval
of each 3D data segment to facilitate the control index to
precisely locate data in the channel. With the control index, the
users can traverse the octree to retrieve their required 3D data.
Considering Figs. 2, 3, and 4 as an example, the user requires
a surface indexed by E10> E11> E12> and E13 in 3D data g1
and arrives at the occurrence of broadcasting index node E0
at the ¿rst index segment. The control index in E0 thereby
directs the user to index node L at the second index segment.
Next, the local index of L leads the user into E1 at the second
index segment. The user thereby can retrieve E10> E11> E12>
and E13 for further traversing the voxel indices in the second
level to obtain the sub-voxels. Therefore, with some auxiliary
indices embedded in the index segment, a server enables the
users to conveniently access their required 3D data.
B. Data Broadcast Program Generation
After indexing every base voxel, TDI allocates the base vox-
els of the 3D data and their indices in the broadcast channel.
We modify the log-time algorithm [7] based on Square-root
Rule to broadcast the popular 3D data of small sizes more
frequently in a broadcast cycle. We ¿rst model the scenario of
broadcasting the 3D data as follows. The data segments and
the index segments are interleaved in the broadcast channel as
shown in Fig. 4. The index tree allocated in the index segment
precedes each data segment in the channel. }l and lqgh{
represent the sizes of the data segment and its corresponding
index segment in the l-th 3D data respectively. Time required
to broadcast the data segment of size }l in the l-th 3D data
and its corresponding index segment is }l+ lqgh{ time units.
An appearance between two similar 3D data segments in the
broadcast channel is referred to as a spacing of the 3D data.
That is, the spacing is a time interval between two the same
3D data. We modify the log-time algorithm based on Vtxduh-
urrw Uxoh to derive an optimal spacing for each 3D data in
Eq. (2). With the optimal spacing of each data, we also derive
the average waiting time in Eq. (1) modi¿ed from the log-time
algorithm. Different from the log-time algorithm, we add the
analysis in the tuning time under TDI as follows. Note that
the tuning time is the time spent by a user listening to the
channel and is also used to determine energy consumption in
a user device to download the required data.
Lemma 1: Given the size of index segment lqgh{ and channel
bandwidth e, the tuning time of downloading l-th 3D data gl
can be formulated as,
wwl =
PP1
m=0 qm(}m + lqgh{)2
2e
PP1
n=0 qn(}n + lqgh{)
+
(4lqgh{+ }l)
e = (3)
Proof. Tuning time is composed of three processes as follows.
Firstly, to retrieve the l-th 3D data, a user listens to a channel
until encountering the nearest index segment. Thus, the wait
time of this probe is modeled as follows. Assume that all index
segments are of the same size. The probability of receiving a
request during the j-th 3D data broadcast at interval  m within
broadcast cycle O is given by qmmO , where qm is the number of
appearances of the m-th 3D data in broadcast cycle O. Since the
aggregate size of the 3D data and their indices in the broadcast
cycle is
PP1
n=0 qn(}n + lqgh{), broadcast cycle O can be
derived as
PP1
n=0 qn(}n + lqgh{)@e. Since the probe wait of
the m-th 3D data at interval  m is m2 , average probe wait for
a user listening to the channel is s =
PP1
m=0
qm2m
2O > where
 m is lqgh{+}le = Secondly, the user listens to four probes for
following the pointers in the index segment. This is because
our index structure includes four-level indices to locate the
requested 3D data: a root index, 3D data indices, and voxel
indices in the ¿rst and second partitioned levels. Finally, the

become hot, the users can immediately retrieve their required
3D data in the current broadcast cycle. Ellipsoid replicates
coarse parts of the 3D data to avoid data loss while the users
still wait for the full version of the required 3D data to appear.
3) Tuning Time Analysis: In this experiment, we examine
the tuning time of Ellipsoid based on a B+ tree [5] and TDI
based on the octree. In the B+ tree, indices are organized with
the B+ tree structure, and distributed indexing is adopted to
allocate these indices into index segments, where the size of
the index segment is 10KB. Fig. 7(a) shows that the tuning
time of each approach gradually increases with increasing the
number of broadcast 3D data. TDI outperforms Ellipsoid about
75% since the octree enables the users to traverse fewer 3D
data indices. TDI enables the users to sequentially access
the 3D data. However, the B+ tree does not consider the
correlations of voxels so as to randomly allocate these data in
the data segment. Hence, in the B+ tree, the users take much
time searching and retrieving the required 3D data. Therefore,
TDI based on the octree indeed provides an effective and
ef¿cient method to tackle advanced 3D multimedia data.
4) Ef¿ciency Analysis: Since the number of 3D data dom-
inates the execution time of each scheme, we focus on this
effect to measure the execution time of each approach. We
assess the execution time of each algorithm with changing
parameter P from 10 to 40. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates that the
execution time of TDI is slightly larger than Ellipsoid. The
reason is that our approach based on the octree to partition
the 3D data and index them. However, the small effort can
bring more access convenience in a user side.
V. CONCLUSION
Data index is a technique to realize energy saving and access
convenience in a mobile computing environment. However,
traditional schemes design data indices without considering
spatial data in the data broadcast. Therefore, the above draw-
back leads to large power consumption and average waiting
time in the broadcast environment. In this paper, the problem
of devising an indexing technique for 3D data was addressed.
In view of the characteristics of 3D vision, we proposed
an algorithm to generate a broadcast program to avoid the
above drawback so as to minimize the average waiting time
of users. We proposed TDI to allocate the 3D data and their
corresponding indices in a broadcast program for minimizing
the average waiting time of the users. In order to evaluate
the performance of TDI, we have conducted several empirical
experiments. During the experiments, we analyzed the effec-
tiveness of TDI in terms of the average waiting time and also
inspected the ef¿ciency of TDI by measuring its execution
time. Experimental results have showed that TDI is of very
high quality and practically useful in the 3D data broadcasting
environment.

Abstract—Data broadcast is an advanced technique to realize
large scalability and bandwidth utilization in a mobile computing
environment. Three dimensional (3D) contents are emerging data
in the data broadcast. However, traditional data broadcast did
not consider 3D data to design a data schedule in a broadcast
channel. Therefore, the above drawback leads to large access
delay in the 3D data broadcast. In this paper, we remedy the
problem by devising an indexing technique to index the 3D data
of variant geometry shapes. We propose an indexing technique
using a 3D data index tree to minimize average waiting time and
average tuning time for broadcasting the 3D data. Experimental
results show that our approach is able to generate broadcast
programs including the 3D data indices with high quality and is
very ef¿cient in the 3D data broadcast.
I. INTRODUCTION
With rapid advances in wireless mobile communication
technologies, mobile users can access information anytime,
anywhere, via wireless mobile devices such as notebooks,
palmtops, smart phones, and so on. Since earlier wireless
communication was limited by scarce channel bandwidth and
lower capability of mobile devices, contents to be delivered are
almost textual information. Therefore, prior works on mobile
data dissemination were mostly based on the assumption of
one-dimension data. In the advanced communication environ-
ment with larger bandwidth, mobile users can access various
modern 3D information services with their high-capability
devices such as high-de¿nition 3D images, videos, audios and
3D multimedia applications.
To transmit the 3D geometry data in the broadcast channel,
the data need to be partitioned into one-dimension (1D) data
buckets. These data buckets are indexed in light of 3D geom-
etry vertices such that users can reconstruct a 3D object by
the indices. Due to the limit of power and network bandwidth
in mobile devices, several research results were developed to
conserve energy and communication bandwidth such as mobile
data dissemination [1], energy ef¿cient indexing [2] [3], and
effective bandwidth allocation [4]. Compared to these index
techniques, the distributed indexing technique based on an
index tree [5] results in lower waiting time, where the index
tree provides a sequence of pointers leading to the required
data. Since the traditional data index does not contain the 3D
information, it is infeasible for the 3D data structure.
In this paper, we consider the Three-Dimension Data In-
dex Allocation Problem. We propose a novel 3D data index
technique referred to as a TDI (Three-dimension Data Index).
TDI is based on octree [6] to partition 3D data into voxels and

indexes these voxels. Note that a voxel is a volume element
representing a value on a regular grid in three dimensional
spaces. Speci¿cally, the octree recursively divides the 3D
data into eight octants until the user-speci¿ed octree level is
reached. Before obtaining the required 3D data, users ¿rst
retrieve the 3D data indices to realize the location of the
required data in the broadcast channel. To avoid missing
the required data indices in the current broadcast cycle, our
approach duplicates the indices preceding each 3D data. As
compared to the traditional data index, the TDI can achieve
shorter waiting time for the users to retrieve their required 3D
data due to the speci¿c 3D data indices locating the 3D data.
To schedule the 3D data in the broadcast channel, we modify
the log-time algorithm [7] based on Square-root Rule to
broadcast the popular 3D data of small sizes more frequently in
a broadcast cycle. The proposed 3D data broadcast technique
can facilitate 3D data access in various 3D on-line applications
to reduce the waiting time of the users. Due to shorter time
listening to the channel in the user end, energy consumption
is much lower than other index techniques.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries
are given in Section II. In Section III, we develop a TDI.
Experimental results are presented in Section IV. Finally, this
paper concludes with Section V.

program to schedule the 3D data in the channel, we place

D. Problem Formulation
We aim to generate a broadcast program to allocate 3D data
and their data indices to a channel such that average waiting
time is minimized. Therefore, the problem of generating the
broadcast program in 3D data environments can be formulated
as follows. Given database G> generate the broadcast program
to allocate the 3D data and their indices into the channel so
that zw can be minimized.
E. Motivation and Contributions
In the data transmission, the internet has evolved from
a low-bandwidth and text-only medium into a ubiquitous
resource of multimedia documents. The current challenge is
to tackle such a new data type in 3D data while the current
data broadcast merely processes the traditional data type such
as text data, 2D images, or videos. 3D data broadcast becomes
indispensible for advanced 3D visual applications. To the best
of our knowledge, there is no previous work on the 3D data
broadcast. In view of those, we focus on developing a general
framework for the 3D data broadcast. We summarize the
contributions of this paper as follows.
·We design the framework for the 3D data broadcast to re-
lease the constraints of the traditional data broadcast. Different
from the traditional data broadcast, our approach can handle
spatial data by transforming the 3D data into 1D data as data
sequences to mitigate the workload on the wireless network.
·We also provide an indexing technique to facilitate user to
access 3D data broadcast. In contrast to the conventional data
index, we modify the octree to effectively partition the 3D
data in any shape and ef¿ciently index the partitioned voxels.
·Different from the traditional 3D data transmission, the
proposed framework is more robust against data loss and
scarce bandwidth. The main reason is that transmitting the
voxels of the 3D data and their indices can combat severe
data loss as compared to the mesh transmission. The indices of
the 3D data can facilitate 3D reconstruction based on the base
voxels in the user side. However, the robustness of transmitting
the mesh of the 3D data is profoundly dependent on all pieces

of 3D information; hence, the whole reconstruction fails as
one single bit is lost during broadcasting [9] [10] [11].
·The large size of the 3D data is infeasible to be downloaded
from a server under the large scale of users. In addition, the
large 3D data sizes waste network bandwidth. These issues
are composed of minimizing the access time of 3D data and
supporting concurrent accesses by many users. Traditional 3D
streaming techniques [9] [11] conform to the traditional client–
server model, which cannot sustain the large scale of the
users due to a longer response time for the users. Therefore,
a 3D-data access technique for the large scale of the users
is indispensable for multimedia 3D applications. However,
traditional 3D streaming techniques [9] [11] are infeasible for
the above demands due to the small scale of the users and the
large consumption of bandwidth resource. These motivate us
to develop a framework to effectively broadcast 3D data.
III. 3D DATA AND INDEX ALLOCATION IN A BROADCAST
PROGRAM
A. 3D Data Index and Data Organization
Different from traditional digital data, users may access
different spatial parts of 3D data from different view angles.
To facilitate 3D data access on a user side in the broadcast,
we propose an indexing technique based on a 3D data index
tree as a data structure, which is referred to as a TDI (Three-
dimension Data Index). Users can ¿rst tune a broadcast chan-
nel to receive index information to realize the locations of their
desired 3D data. Therefore, the users do not exhaustively tune
the channel to ¿nd their desired 3D data. To allocate 3D data
indices to the channel, TDI is based on distributed indexing
[5] due to its lower waiting time of the users with broadcasting
the index tree preceding each data segment as shown in Fig.
4. The 3D data and its corresponding indices are allocated
into a data segment and an index segment respectively as
depicted in Fig. 4. The size of the data segment is equal to the
size of the allocated 3D data. The size of the index segment
is much smaller than that of the data segment and equal as
illustrated in Fig. 4. The data segments and the index segments
are interleaved in the broadcast channel as shown in Fig. 4. The
index tree in the index segment precedes each data segment
in the channel as depicted in Fig. 4.

modeled as 38142 vertices and 77596 triangles. Parts of the 3D
data are shown in Fig. 5. In the beginning, we set the value of
P to 300, the channel bandwidth as 20MBps, the partitioning
level of octree as 3, average 3D data size as 50MBytes, and
skewness parameter  as 0.8. In the following, we compare
the quality of each algorithm in different parameters and the
execution time of each approach.

Channel bandwidth 20Mbps
B. Performance Analysis
1) Effect of the Number of 3D Data: Fig. 6(a) shows that
the average waiting time of all approaches increases with
increasing scales since the number of 3D data allocated to
the broadcast channel also increases. The quality gain of TDI
over Ellipsoid is about 72% under parameter P from 10 to
40. This is because TDI based on the octree transforms the 3D
data into streaming voxels to mitigate the workload in a large-
scale information system. Therefore, users can fast traverse the
octree to realize the speci¿c location of the required 3D data
such that TDI is better than whole 3D data transmission.
2) Effect of Skewness: This experiment investigates the av-
erage waiting time of each approach with changing parameter
 from 1 to 1.3. Fig. 6(b) shows that the average waiting
time of all approaches decreases with increasing . This is
because fewer 3D data are accessed frequently when the access
frequencies become high skewed. TDI is superior to Ellipsoid
with an average of 43%. The reason is that TDI duplicates the
popular 3D data in a broadcast cycle such that users do not
have to wait for a coming broadcast cycle if losing the required
3D data. The experimental result also demonstrates that it
makes sense to replicate the popular 3D data to avoid data loss
in the current broadcast cycle. When fewer 3D data gradually

技術說明
(中文) 隨著快速發展之行動通訊科技,使用者可以在任意時間及任何地點以無線行動裝
置，如:筆記型電腦，PDA及智慧型手機來存取資訊。資料廣播是一項先進的技術，
此技術可在行動資訊環境中達到高延展性及有效使用頻寬。因此，有各式各樣的
技術被設計來提供資料廣播環境中更好的服務。 
在傳統資料廣播中，伺服器在每個時間點廣播一筆資料。因此，若有使用者在同
一時間點想存取兩頻道的資料，上述限制將導致存取衝突使得使用者必須等待下
一個廣播週期才能得到想要的資料。在本計劃中，我們提出嶄新的動態資料廣播
架構。在此架構，資訊系統不再是廣播單筆資料，而是廣播混合多筆資料的編碼
資料。我們根據使用者已存的資料並採用網路編碼技術使得資訊系統可在每個時
間點使資料系統能動態地將多個資料做編碼。使用者可使用已存的資料來解碼已
得到之編碼資料，進而得到需求的資料。因此，我們提出了一套演算法來動態地
產生並排程編碼資料來降低平均等待時間。 
即時要求及回應模式之資料廣播具有高延展性，因此被廣泛應用於行動計算之環
境。然而，之前在此系統之研究仍受限於每個時間點只能廣播一筆資料。此限制
不但降低系統的延展性且導致較長的等待時間。在本計劃中，我們探討如何應用
網路編碼之技術來提升系統的延展性及降低平均等待時間。為了提供即時服務及
達到高延展性，我們提出即時編碼系統。有別於傳統網路編碼，我們的方法只編
碼部分資料而非所有資料。此外，編碼是根據使用者已存的資料及查詢的資料。
因此，可快速產生編碼資料且減少不必要的編碼。 
(英文) In this project, we have proposed a novel data broadcasting framework that adopts 
network coding by leveraging data items stored in users to reduce the average access 
time. In our approach, a server first encodes the data items in each time slot according to 
stored data items in mobile users and then broadcasts the encoding data to the mobile 
users. Then, the mobile users decode the encoded data by using the locally stored data 
items. Afterward, the access patterns of user queries are changed to reflect the change of 
their interest. Thus, the server adapts to the changes of user queries with the better 
services for users. We have designed an algorithm based on the network coding to 
minimize the average access time by maximizing the number of demanding users for the 
dependent data items broadcasting in a multiple channel environment.
