ABSTRACT 
In order to avoid the adjacent constructions from being damaged in deep excavation project, a certain 
auxiliary measurement is usually adopted in restraining the ground movements due to excavation so as to 
protect the adjacent buildings. In recent years, buttress wall has been adopted as an auxiliary measurement in 
protecting the adjacent buildings in excavation; however, it is still in lack of regarding the study of analysis 
methodology of the buttress wall. Thus, concerning the analysis and designing of buttress wall is still staying 
in the empirical stage. Therefore, the further study of analysis methodology of buttress wall is required. 
For this reason, the study will focus on the analysis and prediction of excavation with buttress walls. This 
study first performs the simulation and analysis for an excavation case with buttress walls using 
three-dimensional numerical analysis. Based on the analytic experience, the reasonable methodologies of 
three-dimensional numerical analysis in simulation and decision principle of parameters are recommended. 
Then, a construction project who is excavating now is predicting to verify the methodologies and principle. 
The comparison results show that using the methodologies and principle in three-dimensional numerical 
analysis for analyzing excavation with buttress wall can get a well prediction for lateral wall deflections and 
ground settlements induced by excavation; the maximum lateral wall deflection can be reduced 1/3~2/3 by 
installing buttress walls; the lateral wall deflection will be affected by the interface frictions between buttress 
and soil. 
 
Keywords: deep excavation; buttress wall; three-dimensional numerical analysis; lateral wall deflection. 
 
一、前言 
進行開挖工程時，開挖區周圍某一範圍內的地盤，會因開挖的解壓力而產生位移，若位移量太大
時，在該範圍內的構造物將會因此而受損；為了避免因開挖而損及鄰近構造物，在設計深開挖工程時，
皆應考量到鄰房安全的問題，甚至採取必要的鄰房保護措施。 
一般鄰房保護的方式可分為兩大類，一類為直接在鄰房基礎下方施作補強，以期當開挖引致地盤
沉陷時，可以保護鄰房構造物，避免其受損壞，然而當開挖的周圍有大量的鄰房時，這種方法可能無
法符合經濟上的考量，而且與鄰房的溝通協調也較為不易。因此在實務上大多採用另一種方式，即於

欲探討扶壁之機制及行為，首先必須能合理且有效的模擬分析設置扶壁之開挖；有關開挖工程設
置扶壁後之連續壁位移，根據歐章煜和王怡文[5]的研究，其係屬三向度行為，所以要分析設置扶壁後
之連續壁位移、或有關扶壁配置之設計，應採用三向度數值分析程度進行；有鑑於此，本研究在這年
度的重點工作即為扶壁之案例的分析與研究；本研究首先收集採用扶壁之深開挖案例，包括開挖幾何
條件、地質條件、扶壁幾何條件及監測資料等，然後對該開挖案例進行三向度數值分析研究，以研究
設置扶壁之開挖工程的適當的模擬分析方法，並將分析結果與監測結果進行比較，驗證模擬分析方法，
並建立相關參數的擇取原則；然後對一設置扶壁並正在進行開挖的工程，在其開挖之前，先行以三向
度數值分析程式進行連續壁側向位移的預測，再配合工程開挖的進行，逐階的與現地各階開挖後之壁
體側向位移監測結果進行比較，以進行該開挖工程的回饋分析，據以驗證設置扶壁之開挖的連續壁側
向位移分析模式及參數擇原則，提供工程分析設計使用。 
 
二、三向度數值分析之模擬  
本研究採用三向度有限元素法程式 PLAXIS 3D[6]作為數值分析的工具。分析時，結構材料，包

三、設置扶壁之案例三向度數值分析之模擬和驗證 
為了確認設置扶壁之開挖工程三向度數值分析的適當的模擬分析方法，本研究利用一設置扶壁作
為鄰房保護輔助設施，且施工及監測品質皆相當良好之開挖案例─UPIB[2]進行三向度數值模擬分析，
並將分析結果和監測結果進行比較，以驗證分析參數適用性與分析方法的合理性。 
3.1 工程概況  
UPIB 為一地下 7 層、地上 30 層之鋼構造建築物，基地開挖長寬分別約為 121.8m 及 66.1m，
基地平面如圖 5 所示[2]，基地四周為道路或空地。擋土壁採用厚 1.5m 之連續壁，平均深度約
57.5m，並貫入礫石層約 6m 深，設計之混凝土 fc為 27.5MPa；最後開挖深度為 32.5m，採逆打
工法，分 9 階開挖，其中在第 1、2 階開挖後，分別採用版厚 25cm 及 20cm 之 1FL 及 B1FL 樑
板系統做為支撐系統，第 3~7 階開挖後，分別採用 61cm 厚之 B2FL~B6FL 無樑板系統做為支
撐系統(fc為 27.5MPa)，第 8 階開挖後，主要採用 3-H400×400×13×21mm 做為臨時斜撐，間距
約 6.4m，斜率約為 4.6:6，之後再進行第 9 階開挖；圖 6 表示開挖階段及樓板與鋼支撐位置。  
UPIB 座落於台北盆地地質分區之 K1 區[14]。岩盤約位於深度 66.7m 處，土層依其性質約
可區分為四層，各層之土壤主要性質如圖 6 所示。地下水位約位於地表下 3m，大致呈靜水壓
分佈，礫石層之深層地下水壓的水位面則約位於地表下 10m。  
為減少因為開挖所引致之壁體側向位移及地表沉陷，本工程除於開挖基地之南北走向設置
3 道厚度 1.0m、深度 45m、間距 26m 之地中壁外，於四周連續壁角隅間或與地中壁之間隔跨距
較大處，分別設立 10 道厚度 1.0m、深度 55m 之扶壁，其中東、西兩側分別設立長度(b)12m 及
15m 之扶壁 3 道，南、北兩側分別設立 b 為 6m 之扶壁 3 道及 1 道，如圖 5 所示。地中壁及扶
壁在深度(D)1.5m 以上回填現地土壤，D 等於 1.5m~22m 及 22m 以下分別澆置強度 13.7MPa 及
24.0MPa 之混凝土，並隨著開挖的進行逐階敲除。

3.4 分析結果探討 
3.4.1 土壤參數的影響及決定 
如圖 6 所示，UPIB 的土層除在 Gl.-51m~-66.7m 為級配良好之砂土/礫石層外，在 GL. -51m 以上都
為粘土層，開挖行為主要受此粘土層的影響；本研究分析時，土壤的應力─應變模式採用 HS 模式，表
3 分別列出以 2.2 節所述之三種方法所得土壤之 refE50 、 refoedE 及 refurE ，可發現方法 II 計算所得土壤之 refurE 約
僅是方法 I 之一半；而方法 III 計算之土壤 refurE 和方法 I 的結果是相同的。 
圖 8 為利用方法 I 和方法 II 計算 HS 模式的土壤勁度，分析所得扶壁側(西側)壁體側向位移和地表
沉陷與監測結果之比較；圖 9 為利用方法 I 和方法 III 之土壤參數，分析所得與監測結果之比較。圖 8
和圖 9 中同時也表示了 UPIB 若不設置扶壁時，壁體側向位移和地表沉陷的分析結果。 
圖 8 顯示不論是 SI-9-SEC9 斷面或是 SI-10-SEC10 斷面，方法 I 的分析之壁體側向位移和地表沉陷
 9
另一方面，圖 9 中顯示，方法 III 及方法 I 的分析結果與監測值相當接近，明顯的較方法 II 好。因
此以方法 III 計算 HS 模式之土壤勁度也可得到好的壁體側向位移和地表沉陷分析結果。除此之外，方
法 I 計算之 refE50 、 refoedE 約為方法 III 的 2 倍，但兩種方法的分析的結果差異卻不太，因為對開挖工程而
言，主要影響壁體側向位移和地表沉陷之分析結果的是 refurE ，而 refE50 及 refoedE 對分析結果影響不大。 
因此要合理的分析開挖工程，有效的決定 refurE 是主要的重點，而方法 I 及方法 III 都是合理而可行
的方法。 
 
3.4.2 界面元素的影響及決定 
扶壁可能的機制之一，是當連續壁產生位移時，會推著扶壁往前移動，藉著扶壁與土壤間之摩擦
抵抗，增加側向的抵抗力，如圖 2 所示，藉以減少連續壁之側向位移及開挖區外側之地表沉陷。因此
合理的扶壁和土壤之界面行為的模擬是必須的。 
在數值分析時，有關結構體和土壤之界面的行為，一般是以界面元素模擬，並將結構體和土壤界
面間的摩擦力乘上一折減係數(R)，以模擬兩者間之摩擦抵抗。 
本研究為了探討結構體和土壤界面間之摩擦力，對壁體側向位移及地表沉陷的影響，以 2.2 節所
述之方法 I 計算 HS 模式之土壤勁度，然後對連續壁、地中壁及扶壁與土壤間之界面元素，分別取 R
等於 1.0、0.75 及 0.5 進行分析，以探討 R 的影響及合理的數值。 
圖 10 為 UPIB 之 SI-9-SEC9 斷面，在 R 分別等於 1.0、0.75 及 0.5 時，分析所得之壁體側向位移及
地表沉陷。圖中顯示 R=0.5 的位移量明顯較 R=1.0 及 0.75 的結果大，這是因為 R=0.5 時，代表扶壁和
土壤界面間有較小的摩擦阻抗，所以產生較大的側向位移。而根據圖 10 的比較結果，R=1.0 的分析結
果較符合現地監測結果，因此扶壁和土壤間之界面摩擦力應較接近於現地土壤的剪力強度，採 R=1.0
進行分析，應是較為合理且可行的。 
 
 
圖 10 不同界面元素折減係數所得分析和與監測位移量比較 
 
四、設置扶壁之開挖工程的分析預測與驗證 
本研究和設計、施工及監測水準皆極優良的顧問公司、施工廠商合作，針對一個平面形狀規則、
現在正要進行開挖作業之開挖工程(簡稱驗證工程)，配合本研究的需要，單純採用扶壁作為鄰房保護輔
助措施，並在適當之位置設置監測儀器，以期掌握及取得品質可靠、良好、並可應用於分析研究之監
測結果。然後利用前節之扶壁三向度數值分析的方法，先行進行分析預測，再與實際開挖後之監測結
果進行比較，以驗證設置扶壁之開挖工程的模擬分析方法，以及相關參數的擇取原則。 
 
4.1 驗證工程之工程概況  
驗證工程基地開挖長寬分別約 65m 及 44m，基地平面如圖 11 所示。擋土壁採厚 1.3m 之連
續壁，平均深度約 43.5m，設計之混凝土 fc為 27.5MPa；最後開挖深度為 26.45m，採逆打工法，
分 8 階開挖，其中在第 1、2 階開挖後，分別採用 25cm 厚樓版做為支撐系統，第 3~7 階開挖後，
分別採用 40cm 厚樓板做為支撐系統(fc為 27.5MPa)；圖 12 表示開挖階段及樓板與鋼支撐位置。

2 道長度為 7m、厚度為 0.8m，如圖 11 所示。扶壁在深度 GL.-20.2mm 以上及以下分別澆置 fc
為 13.7MPa 及 27.5MPa 之混凝土，並隨著開挖的進行逐階敲除。  
驗證工程設置 7 支傾斜管(SI1~SI7)，其管底均穿過礫石層，且進入岩盤約 4.5m，以確保底
部處於没有側向位移的狀態，配置位置如圖 11 所示。  
 
3.2 網格及材料參數 
驗證工程進行三向度數值分析時，取 1/4 區塊對稱分析，如圖 11 所示的「分析區塊」。分析
之網格如圖 13 所示；網格邊界條件的設定為底面邊界採用鉸支承，四周邊界採用滾支承。  
分析時，土壤、結構材料的應力─應變模式及模擬之元素皆和 UPIB 相同；對砂土層 HS 模式之勁

excavation transversely before excavation, as shown in Fig. 1, using the same 
diaphragm wall construction technique, e.g., construction of guided walls, excavation of 
trench, casting of concrete and so on. Both ends of cross walls are connected with two 
opposite diaphragm walls. The function of cross walls in mechanism is similar to a 
lateral strut, but the cross wall exists before excavation. Because of the high 
compressive strength and stiffness of cross walls, it is expected to reduce the lateral 
wall deflection and ground settlement during deep excavation.

Though cross walls have been used in some excavations in Taiwan, studying on cross 
wall behavior is few and even documented case histories are rare. Current designs 
mostly remain in accordance with experiences, and the effect of reducing lateral wall 
deflection has not yet been verified. Moreover, cross walls can be constructed with full 
depth, that is, from the ground surface down to the bottom of the diaphragm wall or with 
partial depth, namely, from a certain depth below the ground surface down to a depth 
below the excavation surface. Therefore, a further study of allocations of cross walls on 
the reduction of lateral wall deflection is necessary. 
In this study, a case history with good monitoring results is presented. A reasonable 
three-dimensional numerical analysis for the excavation with cross walls was 
introduced. Both the observed and computed lateral wall deflections for the studied 
case history were compared. Moreover, the same excavation but with the assumption 
that no cross walls were installed was analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of 
cross walls in reducing lateral wall deflection induced by excavation. 
Finally, a series of parametric studies on the different depths of cross walls are 
performed using the three-dimensional numerical method to examine the influence of 
cross walls in reducing the lateral wall deflection. It is expected that with more 
understanding the effect of cross wall depth in reducing the lateral wall deflection, cross 
walls in excavations can be designed in a more compact way and to ensure the 
protection of adjacent buildings. 
 
2.  THE CASE HISTORY 
 
2.1. Project overview  
     The case, situated in the Sinyi district of the Taipei city, is a 30-story structure with a 
seven-level basement. The excavation site was about 121.8 m long and 66.1 m wide. 
Fig. 2 shows the plan view (Ou 2006, Ou 2011). No buildings existed near the 
  
2.2. Subsurface soil profile 
     The bedrock is located at a depth of 66.7 m, and its SPT-N value is greater than 50. 
Above the bedrock are silty clay (CL) and silty sand with gravel (SM/GW). The 
groundwater table is located at GL-3 m. The porewater pressure in silty clay is 
generally hydrostatic, but the piezometric porewater pressure in the SM/GW was 10 m 
below the ground surface, i.e., at GL-10 m. The total unit weight (γt), effective internal 
friction angle (φ’), over-consolidation ratio (OCR), SPT-N value, undrained shear 
strength (su) and porewater pressure (uw) are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in the figure, 
the undrained shear strength of clay was obtained from the triaxial unconsolidated 
undrained (UU) test and the effective strength parameters for clay and sand/gravel 
were obtained from triaxial consolidated undrained test and the direct shear test, 
respectively.

settlement was also very small, with a maximum value being 1.34 cm. As shown in Fig. 
6, the δhm/H  was equal to 0.14%, which is also less than the lower limit of the general 
trend.

3 NUMERICAL ANALYSIS 
 
3.1. Parameters and mesh 
A three-dimensional finite difference computer program, FLAC3D (Itasca 
Consulting Group, Inc. 1997), is used as a basic numerical analysis tool. A pressure 
dependent linear elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive model with the plasticity plateau 
described by the Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion is adopted to simulate the behavior 
of both clay and sand. Table 1 lists the parameters used for analysis where the 
coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K0) was obtained according to Jaky (1944) and 
Alpan (1967); the normalized undrained Young’s modulus (Es/su, Es is Young’s 
modulus) for the Taipei silty clay was found around 400 (Lim 2010), and Poisson’s ratio 
(ν ) for clay under the undrained condition can be set equal to 0.495. For typical sand, it 
is normally assumed that ν =0.3. Considering that the Es of sand increases with the 
confining pressure, the Es can be estimated according to Janbu (1963)

where Pa is the atmospheric pressure, K is the stiffness modulus number, and n is the 
stiffness modulus exponent and σ’3 is the minor effective principal stress.  
According to Ou (1994), n can be reasonably assumed to be 0.5. K can be estimated 
by the wave equation, in which the shear wave velocity of soil can be obtained from the 
cross-hole test or estimated by the relationship between the shear wave velocity and 
SPT-N value.

and those from analysis at final excavation stage (a) SI-8 (SET8) and (b) SO-1 
(SET1) sections. 
 
Fig. 7(a) also shows that the computed wall deflections and surface settlements at the 
cross wall installed section, i.e., SI-8 (SET8), was much smaller than those without 
cross walls and buttress walls. Installation of cross walls can substantially reduce 
lateral wall deflections and surface settlements. The maximum wall deflection and 
surface settlement at the final excavation stage were reduced by 77% and 80%, 
respectively, by the installation of such walls. Like Fig. 7(a), Fig. 7(b) also shows that 
the computed wall deflections and surface settlements at the midpoint of two cross 
walls, i.e., SO-1(SET1) section, were much smaller than those without cross walls and 
buttress walls. Installation of cross walls and buttress walls can substantially reduce 
lateral wall deflections and surface settlements for the section at the midpoint between 
cross walls. The maximum wall deflection and surface settlement at the final excavation 
stage were reduced by 72% and 83%, respectively, by the installation of cross walls. 
Furthermore, analysis of the excavation with only cross walls, i.e., no buttress walls, 
was carried out to examine the contribution of buttress walls at the midpoint of two 
cross walls, i.e., at SO-1(SET1) section, in reducing the lateral wall deflection and 
surface settlement. The computed results are also shown in Fig. 7(b). Little difference 
  
the total of eight sets of excavations. The results are shown in Fig. 8. It is found that 
(Hch/He)cr and (Hce/Hp)cr were generally in the range of 0.4~0.6 and 0.5~0.7, respectively.  
Therefore, to have an economic design of a cross wall and also have a good reduction 
in wall deflection, it is reasonable to install the cross wall that both Hch/He and Hce/Hp 
are about equal to 0.6.

Fig. 9 shows the lateral wall deflections at the midpoint of two cross walls and at the 
cross wall section for the cases of Hch/He =1.0, Hce/Hp =1.0 and of Hch/He =0.6, Hce/Hp 
=0.6, when He =20 m, L′=28 m and B=40 m. For comparison, results from the analysis 
for no cross walls are also shown on the same figure. The lateral wall deflections for 
those with cross walls with different depths were all much smaller than those of no 
cross walls. Installation of cross walls obviously can reduce the lateral wall deflections 
at the midpoint of two cross walls and at the cross wall section. The figure also shows 
that an excavation with Hch/He =1 and Hce/Hp =1 can yield the best reduction in lateral 
wall deflections. The lateral wall deflections at the cross wall section and at the 
midpoint of the two cross walls for the case of Hch/He =0.6, Hce/Hp =0.6 are quite close 
to those with full cross wall height and embedment. Use of the cross wall height and

Since 1930 electroosmosis has been used as a tool in geotechnical engineering to 
improve the mechanical strength of soft clay. Casagrande and Casagrande (1986) 
attempted to improve the strength of sensitive silty clay by electroosmosis. 
Fundamental aspects of electroosmosis in soil were reported by Gray and Mitchell 
(1967). The main mechanism of improving soft clay for electroosmosis is dewatering, 
which leads to consolidation and a consequent increase in strength of the soil until 
intergranular stresses are in equilibrium with the tension that develops in the pore water 
during electroosmosis. 
To enhance the effect of electroosmotic improvement, injection of chemical 
solutions into soil from the anode or cathode during electroosmosis has been adopted 
in recent years (Lefebvre 2002, Alshawabkeh  2004, Asavadorndeja 2005, Paczkowska 
2005, Otsuki 2007, Ou 2009a, Ou 2009b, Chien 2009; Abdullah 2010; Chien 2010). 
The technique sometimes is termed as the electroosmotic chemical treatment (ECT). It 
has been found, in the literature, that the effect of electroosmosis can be enhanced by 
injecting chemical solutions during electroosmosis, such as NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, 
aluminum ions, phosphoric ions, methacrylate poly cations, Al2(SO4)3, Mg (CH3COO)2, 
MgSO4, Mg(NO3)2, ZnSO4, AgNO3, NaOH, and Na2CO3. With the ECT soil 
improvement, a substantial strength increase can be gained by chemical reactions in 
the soil matrix including cation exchange, cementation, and precipitation other than 
consolidation. However, most of the ECT soil improvement only occurs in the region 
near the anode or cathode. Asavadorndeja (2005) applied the electrockinetic 
strengthening of soft clay using the anode depolarization method for increase in 
improvement region. Increases in strength up to 170% immediately after treatment and 
up to 570% after a 7 days curing were measured. The depolarization method can 
enhance the improvement area nearly covered the entire specimen from the anode to 
the cathode. Chien (2010) made good progress in an electroosmotic application by 
installing a relay pipe between the anode and the cathode. The results showed that the 
cementation area nearly covered the entire specimen and its average cone resistance 
could be raised to nine times more than that of the untreated soil. 
Despite many studies in the past, ECT has not yet received a wide application, 
because some uncertainties remain. For example, long-term performance of improved 
soil is not fully understood. The ECT still needs a quite long treatment time, for instance, 
Alshawabkeh (2003) spent over 14 days to treat the soil in the laboratory and Burnotte 
(2004) 48 days in the field. The strength increase may not be uniform across the cross 
section of the sample and with depth (Ozkan 1999). Caron (1971) also found from 
some unsuccessful applications that continuous sand and silt layers in the subsoil are 
not favorable for ECT because the relatively high conductivity of such layers causes 
loss of chemical solutions during electroosmosis. The loss of chemical solutions might 
affect the efficiency of ECT. However, a clay strata with interbedded permeable soils 
such as sand or silt are often encountered in the field and few studies on the ECT soil 
improvement on such a soil stratum were conducted in the past.  
In this study, a small scale of test cell with a pair of electrodes was design to 
develop an appropriate ECT process for clay strata with sand layers. A clay stratum 
overlying a sand layer was used to make the relatively high conductivity of sand layer 
that may cause the loss of chemical solutions during ECT. As a matter of fact, many 
pairs of electrodes, anode and cathode, are normally used for tens of meters wide in 
  
Kaolinite and very clean sand, of which the basic properties are listed in Table 1, 
were used in this study. The particle size distribution of the sand was 0.3-3 mm. The 
objective of selected sand was to make the relatively high conductivity of sand layer 
that causes loss of chemical solution during electroosmosis. Kaolinite powder was 
thoroughly mixed with a sufficient amount of distilled deionized water by a mechanical 
mixer so its water content was 60%. The sand was first placed and then layers of 
kaolinite slime were placed in the test container. The purpose of adding water was to 
ensure more than 100% saturation and high workability. At each layer, air bubbles were 
eliminated by a vibrator. After putting sand and slime of kaolinite in the experimental 
cell, it was covered with a filter paper, and then the electrode (platinum coated titanium 
mesh) was attached. The samples for the electroosmotic test were then made by 
applying 30 kPa of the vertical pressure to the soil by increments to reproduce the 
normally consolidated condition and the state of stress at a depth of about 3 m below 
the ground surface. Thus, the water content of the sample (kaolinite) following 
consolidation equaled 51%. Table 1 lists the physical properties of the sample. Table 1 
shows the liquid limit and plastic limit are 46% and 25%, respectively. 
 
Table 1. Summary of soil properties. 
 
2.3. Test procedure 
The sand was first placed and then layers of kaolinite slime were placed in the test 
container. Sodium silicate solution was injected into the sand seam by pressure before 
ECT. The sample (sand and kaolinite) was consolidated at 30 kPa pressure in 
increments. After setting up the specimen, the sample was treated by injecting 
chemical solutions during electroosmosis under the consolidation pressure of 30 kPa. 
ECT was carried out by injecting calcium chloride over different treatment times (24, 48,

hour treatment times were used, respectively. The initial permeability coefficient of the 
interbedded sand was 1.58×10-4 m/s. Therefore, the permeability coefficient of 
interbedded sand could be effectively reduced to 10-5-10-6 m/s by first injecting the 
sodium silicate solution into the sand seam by pressure before ECT, followed by 
injecting the calcium chloride solution during electroosmosis. 
 
 
Fig. 2 Effect of different treatment times with injection of calcium chloride on the 
permeability coefficient of sand. 
 
The permeability coefficients of interbedded sand after ECT for the samples of 
TCS1, TCS2, and TCS3 are shown in Fig. 3. When calcium chloride (24, 48, and 72 
hour) followed by sodium silicate (144, 120, and 96 hour) were injected, a significant 
change in the permeability coefficient of interbedded sand was observed. The 
permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand was 2.7×10-7 m/s, 8.3×10-8 m/s, and 
6.6×10-8 m/s when 24, 48, and 72 hour treatment times with calcium chloride and 144, 
120, and 96 hour treatment times with sodium silicate were used, respectively. Hence, 
the permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand could be more effectively reduced 
to 10-7-10-8 m/s by first injecting the sodium silicate solution into the sand seam by 
pressure before ECT, followed by injecting the calcium chloride solution and sodium 
silicate solution during electroosmosis. 
  
 
Fig. 4 Profiles of cone resistance for different treatment times with injection of calcium 
chloride. 
 
Figure 5 illustrates the cone resistance after ECT for samples of TCS1, TCS2, and 
TCS3. When calcium chloride (24, 48, and 72 hour) followed by sodium silicate (144, 
120, and 96 hour) were injected, a more significant increase of cone resistance in sand 
was observed from the anode to the cathode. At the NA, FA, and M positions, the cone 
resistance in soft clay was increased slightly due to cation exchange and decreased 
water content (effect of electroosmosis) for samples of TCS1, TCS2, and TCS3. A 
remarkable increase in the cone resistance for the soft clay was observed when the 
specimen was treated for 72 hours with calcium chloride followed by 96 hours with 
sodium silicate (TCS3), compared with the samples of TCS1 and TCS2. The average 
cone resistances in the FC and NC regions for soft clay that underwent a 72 hours with 
calcium chloride followed by 96 hours with sodium silicate (TCS3) reaching 654 kPa 
and 1,284 kPa, respectively. 
  
interbedded sand could be more effectively reduced to 10-7-10-8 m/s (Fig. 3). The 
increased cone resistance on the sand from the anode to the cathode (Fig. 5) also 
confirm the above decrease in the permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand and 
pozzolanic reaction. 
Therefore, the injection of chemical solutions (calcium chloride) could be effectively 
flowed in the soft clay (kaolinite) during electroosmosis due to the decreased 
permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand. 
 
4. Conclusion  
 
From the unsuccessful application, it is deduced continuous sand and silt layers in 
the subsoil are unfavorable for ECT. Because of the relatively high conductivity of such 
layers, it would cause loss of chemical solution from the relatively high permeability 
coefficient of such layers during electroosmosis. The purpose of this study was to avoid 
loss of chemical solutions from the interbedded sand during electroosmosis and to 
improve the soft clay. An appropriate ECT process for soft clay with interbedded sand 
was developed. A series of laboratory ECT tests were performed to verify the 
developed ECT process. Though the laboratory ECT tests were with limited scale and a 
specific type of soil stratum, which may be different from what is actually found in the 
field, the developed process should be applicable to real field condtions with complicate 
subsoil deposits. 
  The calcium chloride and sodium silicate were used as chemical solutions. 
Variables like permeability coefficient and cone resistance of samples were measured 
after ECT. The results show the permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand could 
be effectively reduced to 10-5-10-6 m/s by first injecting the sodium silicate solution into 
the sand layerby pressure before ECT, followed by injecting the calcium chloride 
solution by electroosmosis. Therefore, the injection of chemical solutions could 
effectively flow in the soft clay during electroosmosis, resulting in strength improvement 
of the soft clay after decreases in the permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand. 
The strength of soft clay was increased by up to 20 times the original strength near the 
cathode region. These results confirm the improved soil strength was mainly due to the 
precipitation reaction of Ca2+ ions and pozzolanic reaction near the NC position during 
ECT. Moreover, the permeability coefficient of the interbedded sand could be more 
effectively reduced to 10-7-10-8 m/s by first injecting the sodium silicate solution into the 
sand seam by pressure before ECT, followed by injecting the calcium chloride solution 
and sodium silicate solution during electroosmosis.
