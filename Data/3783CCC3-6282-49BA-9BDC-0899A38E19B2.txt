implantation into GaN-based p-i-n structure grown by metalorganic vapor-phase 
epitaxy. Triple silicon implantation was performed to form a selective n+-channel 
through the multi-layer p-i-n structure. As a result of n+-channel formation, a planar 
GaN p-i-n detector could be obtained. With the reverse bias below 2V, the dark 
current was well below 50pA. The dark current increased significantly with an 
increase of reverse bias, which may be attributed to the incomplete damage (from 
implantation) removal and thereby result in the higher leakage current. The typical 
peak responsivity and the cutoff wavelength for the Si-implanted planar p-i-n PDs 
were around 0.13A/W and 365nm, respectively. In addition, the visible 
(450nm)-to-UV (365nm) rejection ratio of around three to four orders could be 
extracted from the spectra response. Furthermore, the transient response 
measurements revealed that the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of impulse 
response was as low as 1.12ns.

II. Experiments 
 
Prior to Si ion implantation, GaN-based p-i-n structures were grown by 
metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy on c-face sapphire substrates. The layer structure 
was comprised of a 300Å-thick GaN nucleation layer grown on the sapphire substrate 
and followed by a 3.5µm-thick Si-doped GaN layer(nd～2×1018cm-3), a 0.15µm-thick 
undoped GaN absorption layer (n～3×1016 cm-3), and a 500Å-thick Mg-doped GaN 
capping layer(na～5×1017 cm-3). Details of the GaN growing procedures have already 
been described in other sources. [6] In this study, Triple silicon implantation was 
performed to form a selective n+-channel through the multi-layer p-i-n structure. 
Therefore, planar GaN p-i-n PD with a concentric-circle configuration could be 
obtained, as shown in the Figure 1.  The triple implantation condition (dose/energy) 
was equal to 1.5×1014 cm-2/40KeV, 3×1014 cm-2/100KeV, and 6×1014 cm-2/150KeV. 
The overall implantation depth was estimated to be about 0.25 µ m. [6]. The 
implanted samples were then thermal annealed at 1100°C for 60sec. As a result, the 
p-GaN and the undoped GaN layers in the selective implanted area could be 
converted into a low-resisitivity n+-GaN channel connecting the n+-GaN epitaxial 
layer. The electron concentration of the implanted n+-GaN layer was around 3.2×1018 
cm-3, as determined by Hall-effect measurement [7]. P-type (Ni/Au) contacts and 
n-type (Ti/Al/Ti/Au) contacts were deposited and patterned by e-beam evaporator and 
a standard lift off process, respectively. Ti/Al/Ti/Au (30/120/80/150nm) and Ni/Au 
(5/10nm) metal contacts were then annealed in N2 ambient to serve as the contact 
materials on Si-implanted n+-GaN and p-GaN surfaces, respectively. 
Room-temperature current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of these diodes were then 
measured using an HP4146C semiconductor parameter analyzer. Spectral responsivity 
of the planar GaN p-i-n PD was also measured using an Xe arc lamp and a calibrated 
 6
depleted when the reverse bias voltages were above 2 V, because the thickness of the 
p-layer was only 50 nm, and its hole concentration was around 3 × 1017 cm-3. 
Therefore, one can widen the thickness and/or increase the hole concentration of the 
p-layer to alleviate the above-mentioned bias-dependent reverse current. However, the 
approach described above would result in reduction of responsivity due to the 
absorption of the thick p-layer. For p-type doping of GaN, deep acceptor level that 
occurs due to larger hole mass and creates difficulties for p-type doping and the very 
low activation efficiency of dopants at room temperature for GaN[8]. Previous reports 
have shown that one can increase acceptor ionization efficiency and hole 
concentration by introducing Mg-doped AlGaN/GaN strained layer superlattice (SLS) 
structure into p-GaN. [8] Additionally, enhanced responsivity of GaN-based p-i-n UV 
PDs with low-resistivity SLS have been demonstrated. [9] 
Figure 3 shows the typical spectral responsivity of the Si-implanted planar GaN 
p-i-n PDs under reverse bias. It was found that the cutoff occurred at around 365nm. 
Theoretically, when the incident photon energy is greater than GaN band-gap energy, 
all optical energy is absorbed, and in turn transferred to photocurrent. For this reason, 
if GaN p-i-n PDs are to have a broad spectral responsivity, the high energy photons 
absorbed by the p-GaN layer should be minimized. The Si-implanted planar GaN 
p-i-n PDs showed a flat short-wavelength spectral response due to the thickness of 
p-GaN top layer being only 50 nm. In other words, only photons with energy close to 
or less than the band-gap energy of GaN could reach deeper to produce electron–hole 
pairs in the depletion region (i-layer) if p-i-n PDs were designed to have thick p-GaN 
top layer. As shown in Fig.3, the peak responsivity of the planar Si-implanted GaN 
p-i-n PDs is 0.13A/W. In addition, the visible (450nm)-to-UV (360nm) rejection ratio 
of around three to four orders could be extracted from the spectra response.
