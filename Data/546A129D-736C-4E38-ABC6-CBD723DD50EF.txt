ABSTRACT: A series of electroactive aromatic polyamides with 4-(dimethylamino)triphenylamine [(NMe2)TPA]
units in the backbone were prepared from a newly synthesized diamine monomer, 4,4′-diamino-4′′-(dimethyl-
amino)triphenylamine, and various aromatic dicarboxylic acids via the phophorylation polyamidation reaction.
These polyamides are readily soluble in many organic solvents and can be solution-cast into tough and amorphous
films. They had useful levels of thermal stability associated with relatively high glass-transition temperatures
(277–298 °C), 10% weight loss temperatures in excess of 500 °C, and char yields at 800 °C in nitrogen higher
than 67%. The polymer films showed reversible electrochemical oxidation accompanied by strong color changes
with high coloration efficiency, high contrast ratio, and rapid switching time. The optical transmittance change
(∆%T) at 640 nm between the neutral state and the fully oxidized state is up to 88%, and the coloration efficiency
is as high as ca. 261 cm2/C with high optical density change (δOD) up to 0.94. The polymers also displayed low
ionization potentials as a result of their (NMe2)TPA moieties. Cyclic voltammograms of the polyamide films on
the indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate exhibited a pair of reversible oxidation waves with very low
onset potential of 0.35 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in acetonitrile solution.
Introduction
Electrochromism is known as the reversible change in optical
absorption or transmittance upon redox switching.1 This inter-
esting property led to the development of many technological
applications such as automatic antiglazing mirror, smart win-
dows, electrochromic displays, and chameleon materials.2 Many
different classes of electrochromic materials, such as organic
systems, e.g., bipyridium salt (also known as viologens),3
electroactive conducting polymers (e.g., polyanilines,4 poly-
thiophenes,5 and polypyrroles),6 as well as inorganic systems
based on transition metal oxides (e.g., WO3),7 have been
described. Conducting or conjugated polymers have been found
to be more promising as electrochromic materials because of
their better stability, faster switching speeds, and easy processing
compared to the inorganic electrochromic materials, but the most
exciting properties are the display of multiple colors with the
same material while switching between their different redox
states,8 and fine-tuning of the color transition through chemical
structure modification of the conjugated backbone.9,10 Consider-
able effort in the Reynolds group has been made on the
understanding and the tailoring of electrochromic properties
in conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythi-
ophene)s5 and poly(3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole)s6 and their de-
rivatives.
Triarylamine derivatives are well-known for photo and
electroactive properties that find optoelectronic applications as
photoconductors, hole transporters, and light emitters.11 Tri-
arylamines can be easily oxidized to form stable radical cations,
and the oxidation process is always associated with a noticeable
change of coloration. Thus, many triarylamine-based electro-
chromic polymers have been reported in the literature.12 In
recent years, we have developed a number of high-performance
polymers (e.g., aromatic polyamides and polyimides) carrying
the triphenylamine (TPA) unit as an electrochromic functional
moiety.13 Our strategy was to synthesize the TPA-containing
monomers such as diamines and dicarboxylic acids that were
then reacted with the corresponding comonomers through
conventional polycondensation techniques. The obtained poly-
mers possessed characteristically high molecular weights and
high thermal stability. Because of the incorporation of packing-
disruptive, propeller-shaped TPA units along the polymer
backbone, most of these polymers exhibited good solubility in
polar organic solvents. They may form uniform, transparent
amorphous thin films by solution-casting and spin-coating
methods. This is advantageous for their ready fabrication of
large-area thin-film devices.
In order to be useful for applications, electrochromic materials
must exhibit long-term stability, rapid redox switching, and large
changes in transmittance (large ∆%T) between their bleached
and colored states.14 As an electrochromic functional moiety,
the TPA unit has two basic properties: (1) the easy oxidizability
of the nitrogen center and (2) its hole-transporting ability via
the radical cation species. However, unsubstituted TPA under-
goes coupling deprotonation to form tetraphenylbenzidine after
the formation of the initial monocation radical.15 The oxidation
potential and the π-π* bandgap of the product, generally called
triaryldiamine, are different from that of the starting material.
Therefore, the small concentration of the product may cause
an unstable color change of the electrochromic material during
redox switching. The formation of protons as byproduct may
deteriorate the coloration efficiency of the electrochromic
devices through undesirable side reactions. It has been well
established that incorporation of electron-donating substituents
such as methoxy group at the para position of TPA prevents
the coupling reactions and affords stable radical cations.15,16 It
has also been demonstrated that carbazole derivatives with
dimethylamino (NMe2) groups para to the carbazole nitrogen
could afford quite stable radical cations in the first one-electron
oxidation process and reasonably stable dication quinonedi-

increasing anodic currents pointing upward. Spectroelectrochemical
experiments were carried out in a cell built from a commercial
UV–visible cuvette using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV–visible diode

the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode,
and a Ag/AgCl cell as the reference electrode.
Results and Discussion
Monomer Synthesis. The new (NMe2)TPA-diamine mono-
mer 2 was synthesized by hydrazine Pd/C-catalyzed reduction
of the dinitro compound 1 resulting from the CsF-promoted,
aromatic fluoro displacement reaction18 of 4-fluoronitrobenzene
by N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Scheme 1). Elemental

viscosities in the range of 0.77-1.64 dL/g, as shown in Table
1. All the polymers could afford transparent and tough films
via solution casting, indicating high molecular weights. The
structures of the polyamides could be confirmed by IR and NMR
spectroscopy. A typical IR spectrum for polyamide 4a is given
in Figure S2 in Supporting Information. The characteristic IR
absorption bands of the amide group appeared at around 3280
cm-1 (N-H stretch) and 1657 cm-1 (amide carbonyl). 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra of polyamide 4b are illustrated in Figure
2. Assignments of each proton and carbon are also given in the
figure, and these spectra agree well with the proposed polymer
structure. Two structurally related polyamides 4b′ and 4c′
derived from (NPh2)TPA-diamine 2′ are used for comparison
studies. The synthesis and characterization of polymers 4b′ and
4c′ have been described previously.13b

polymers indicated no clear melting endotherms up to the
decomposition temperatures on the DSC thermograms. This
result supports the amorphous nature of these polyamides. As
can be seen from Table 2, polyamides 4b and 4c revealed a
slightly higher Tg as compared to their respective analogs 4b′
and 4c′. This result implies that the bulky NPh2 substituent in
the 4′ series polyamides leads to an increase in steric hindrance
for close chain packing, as well as an enhanced fractional free
volume between polymer chains.
Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical properties
of the polyamides were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
conducted for the cast film on an ITO-coated glass slide as
working electrode in anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN), using 0.1
M of TBAP as a supporting electrolyte under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Figure 4 displays the first CV scan of polyamide
4b; we observe two reversible redox steps at the half-wave
oxidation potential (E1/2) of 0.45 and 0.91 V, respectively. When
comparing the first and second oxidation steps, the first oxidation
step exhibited smaller anodic and cathodic currents and larger
difference between Epa and Epc (∆Ep ) 0.29 V) than the second
step (∆Ep ) 0.16 V). It could be attributed to the lower
heterogeneous electron transfer rate of first oxidation step.20 The
color of the film changed from colorless to green and then to
deep blue because of electrochemical oxidation of the polymer.
The oxidative and electrochromic reversibility of polymer 4b
is maintained on repeated scanning between 0 and 1.4 V (vs
Ag/AgCl). This result confirms that para-substitution of the
NMe2 group on the TPA unit lends considerable stability to
both the cation radical and dication quinonediimine species, as
shown in Scheme 3. The other polyamides showed similar CV
curves to that of 4b. The redox potentials of the various
polyamides as well as their respective HOMO and LUMO
potentials (vs vacuum) are shown in Table 3. It is also worth
noting that polyamide 4b reveals a lower onset oxidation
potential (Eonset) (0.38 V) compared to its analog 4b′ (Eonset )
0.53 V) with an NPh2 substituent on the TPA unit. This indicates
that the first oxidation wave in the CV curve of polyamide 4b
is attributed to its NMe2 groups. As shown in Table 3, the
HOMO level or called ionization potentials (vs vacuum) of
polyamides 4a–4d are estimated from the onset of their
oxidation in CV experiments as 4.68–4.74 eV (on the basis that
ferrocene/ferrocenium is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The
lower ionization potential could suggest an easier hole injection
into films from ITO electrodes in electronic device applications.
Traditionally, introduction of TPA units in conjugated polymers
or organic molecules was found to effectively enhance the hole-
injecting properties of the resulting materials.21
Spectroelectrochemical and Electrochromic Characteris-
tics. Following the electrochemical tests, the optical properties
of the electrochromic films were evaluated by using spectro-
electrochemistry. For these investigations, the polyamide film
was cast on an ITO-coated glass slide (a piece that fit in the
commercial UV–visible cuvette), and a homemade electro-
chemical cell was built from a commercial UV–visible cuvette.
The cell was placed in the optical path of the sample light beam
in a commercial diode array spectrophotometer. This procedure
allowed us to obtain electronic absorption spectra under potential
control in a 0.1 M TBAP/MeCN solution. The result of the 4b
film is presented in Figure 5 as a series of UV–vis absorbance
curves correlated to electrode potentials. Figure 6 shows the
three-dimensional % transmittance-wavelength-applied potential
correlations of this sample. In the neutral form, at 0 V, the film
exhibited strong absorption at wavelength around 350 nm,
characteristic for triarylamine, but it was almost transparent in
the visible region. Upon oxidation of the 4b film (increasing
applied voltage from 0 to 0.7 V), the intensity of the absorption
peak at 351 nm gradually decreased while a new peak at 400
nm and a broadband having its maximum absorption wavelength
at 805 nm gradually increased in intensity. We attribute this
spectral change to the formation of a stable monocation radical
of the (NMe2)TPA moiety. As the applied potential became
more anodic to 1.2 V, the absorption bands of the cation radical
decreased gradually in intensity, with the formation of a new
broadband centered at around 640 nm. This spectral change can
be attributable to the formation of a dication in the (NMe2)TPA
segment of the polyamide. The observed UV–vis absorption
changes in the film of 4b at various potentials are fully reversible
and are associated with strong color changes; indeed, they even
can be seen readily by the naked eye. From the inset shown in
Figure 5, it can be seen that the film of 4b switches from a
transmissive neutral state (colorless) to a highly absorbing
semioxidized state (green) and a fully oxidized state (deep blue).
The film colorations are distributed homogeneously across the

Conclusions
A new triphenylamine-based aromatic diamine monomer,
4,4′-diamino-4′′-(dimethylamino)triphenylamine, was synthe-
sized in high purity and high yields from readily available
reagents. A series of novel 4-(dimethylamino)triphenylamine
[(NMe2)TPA]-functionalized aromatic polyamides were readily
prepared from the newly synthesized diamine monomer with
various aromatic dicarboxylic acids via the phosphorylation
polyamidation reaction. Introduction of extremely electron-
donating (NMe2)TPA group to the polymer main chain not only
stabilizes triphenylamine cationic radicals and dications but also
leads to good solubility and film-forming properties of the
polyamides. In addition to high Tg and good thermal stability,
all the obtained polymers also reveal valuable electrochromic
characteristics such as high contrast (colorless neutral form to
oxidized dark blue forms), high coloration efficiency, good
electrochromic reversibility and rapid switching times. Thus,
these characteristics suggest that these new polyamides have
great potential for use in optoelectronics applications.

A 4-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine containing the aromatic diamine, 4,49-diamino-
40-methoxytriphenylamine (2), was synthesized by the caesium fluoride-mediated condensation of
p-anisidine with 4-fluoronitrobenzene, followed by palladium-catalyzed hydrazine reduction of
the dinitro intermediate. A series of new polyamides with pendent 4-methoxy-substituted
triphenylamine (TPA) units having inherent viscosities of 0.27–1.39 dL g21 were prepared via the
direct phosphorylation polycondensation of various dicarboxylic acids and the diamine (2). All
the polymers were readily soluble in many organic solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and could be solution-cast into tough and flexible
polymer films. These aromatic polyamides had useful levels of thermal stability associated with
their relatively high softening temperature (242–282 uC), 10% weight-loss temperatures in excess
of 470 uC, and char yields at 800 uC in nitrogen higher than 60%. The hole-transporting and
electrochromic properties are examined by electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods.
Cyclic voltammograms of the polyamide films cast onto an indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass
substrate exhibited reversible oxidation at 0.73–0.79 V versus Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile solution,
and revealed excellent stability of electrochromic characteristics with a color change from
colorless to green at applied potentials ranging from 0.00 to 1.05 V. These anodically polymeric
electrochromic materials not only showed excellent reversible electrochromic stability with good
green coloration efficiency (CE = 374 cm2 C21) but also exhibited high contrast of optical
transmittance change (DT %) up to 85% at 787 nm and 30% at 391 nm. After over 1000 cyclic
switches, the polymer films still exhibited excellent stability of electrochromic characteristics.
Introduction
Electrochromism can be defined as the reversible change in
optical properties of a material resulting from electrochemi-
cally induced redox states. Color changes are commonly
between a transparent state, where the chromophore only
absorbs in the UV region, and a colored state, or between two
colored states in a given electrolyte solution. The electro-
chromic material may exhibit several colors and be termed
polyelectrochromic. Electrochromic anti-glare car rear-view
mirrors have already been commercialized, with other
proposed applications of electrochromic materials including
their use in controllable light-reflective or light-transmissive
devices for optical information and storage, sunglasses,
protective eyewear for the military, controllable aircraft
canopies, and glare-reduction systems for offices and smart
windows for use in cars and buildings.1–3
The first studies and commercial interests in electrochromic
materials started with inorganic compounds such as tungsten
trioxide (WO3) and iridium dioxide (IrO2).
4 Later, organic
materials (i.e., viologens, metallophthalocyanines and conju-
gated polymers) have received more attention than inorganics
for electrochromic applications because of the different colors
observed with these compounds while switching among their
redox states.1,5,6 Although conjugated polymers (CPs) in
particular have several advantages over inorganic compounds,
i.e., outstanding coloration efficiency, fast switching ability,
high stability, fine-tuning of the band gap (and the color)
through chemical structure modification, multiple colors with
the same material,7 thin film flexibility and cost effectiveness,
they have not received enough attention in terms of applica-
tions. One of the main reasons for this was the deficient third
leg (green) of color space in conjugated polymers (CPs). Until
the first report about a green-colored neutral conjugated poly-
mer (CP) was published,8 researches on conjugated polymers
(CPs) as cathodic electrochromics mainly focused on red and
blue colors. For green color, at least two chromophores are
required that absorb at red and blue wavelengths in the neutral
form, and should also deplete together when the polymer is
oxidized.
Wholly aromatic polyamides are characterized as highly
thermally stable polymers with a favorable balance of physical
and chemical properties. However, rigidity of the backbone
and strong hydrogen bonding results in high melting or
glass-transition temperatures (Tgs) and limited solubility in
most organic solvents.9,10 These properties make them
generally intractable or difficult to process, thus restricting

was as follows. A mixture of 0.382 g (1.25 mmol) of 4,49-
diamino-40-methoxytriphenylamine (2), 0.208 g (1.25 mmol) of
terephthalic acid (Id), 0.15 g of calcium chloride, 1.25 mL of
TPP, 0.6 mL of Py, and 1.25 mL of NMP was heated with
stirring at 105 uC for 3 h. The polymer solution was poured
slowly into 300 mL of stirring methanol giving rise to a stringy,
fiber-like precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed
thoroughly with hot water and methanol successively,
and dried under vacuum at 100 uC; yield: 0.538 g (99%).
Reprecipitations from DMAc into methanol were carried out
twice for further purification. The inherent viscosity of the
obtained polyamide IId was 0.79 dL g21, measured at a
concentration of 0.5 g dL21 in NMP at 30 uC. The IR
spectrum of IId (film) exhibited characteristic amide absorp-
tion bands at 3310 (N–H stretching), 1654 cm21 (amide
carbonyl). Anal. Calcd for (C27H21N3O3)n (435.47)n: C,

N, 9.48%. The other polyamides were prepared by an
analogous procedure.
Preparation of the films
A solution of the polymer was made by dissolving about 0.5 g
of the polyamide sample in 10 mL of DMAc or NMP. The
homogeneous solution was poured into a 9 cm glass Petri dish,
which was placed in a 90 uC oven for 5 h to remove most of the
solvent; then the semi-dried film was further dried in vacuo at
170 uC for 8 h. The obtained films were about 40–60 mm thick
and were used for X-ray diffraction measurements, solubility
tests, and thermal analyses.
Measurements
Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer RXI FT-IR
spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in an Elementar
Vario EL-III. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a
Bruker AV-400 FT-NMR system and referenced to the
DMSO-d6 signal, and peak multiplicity was reported as
follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet. The
inherent viscosities were determined at 0.5 g dL21 concentra-
tion using a Tamson TV-2000 viscometer at 30 uC. Wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were performed at
room temperature (ca. 25 uC) on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 X-ray
diffractometer (40 kV, 20 mA), using graphite-monochroma-
tized Cu-Ka radiation. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of
the polymers were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 Probe
spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was con-
ducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were
carried out on approximately 6–8 mg film samples heated in
flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate = 20 cm3 min21) at a heating
rate of 20 uC min21. Thermomechanical analysis (TMA) was
conducted with a PerkinElmer TMA 7 instrument. The TMA
experiments were conducted from 50 to 350 uC at a scan rate of
10 uC min21 with a penetration probe 1.0 mm in diameter
under an applied constant load of 10 mN. Softening tempera-
tures (Tss) were taken as the onset temperatures of probe
displacement on the TMA traces. Cyclic voltammetry was
performed with a Bioanalytical System Model CV-27 poten-
tiostat and a BAS X-Y recorder with ITO (polymer film area
about 0.7 cm 6 0.5 cm) as a working electrode and a platinum
wire as an auxiliary electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s21
against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a solution of
0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) : acetonitrile
(CH3CN). Voltammograms are presented with the positive
potential pointing to the left and with increasing anodic
currents pointing downwards. The spectroelectrochemical cell
was composed of a 1 cm cuvette, ITO as a working electrode, a
platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode. Absorption spectra in spectroelecto-
chemical analysis were measured with a HP 8453 UV-vis
spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were measured
with a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence
quantum yields (WF) of the samples in NMP were measured
by using quinine sulfate in 1 M H2SO4 as a reference standard
(WF = 0.546).
31 All corrected fluorescence excitation spectra
were found to be equivalent to their respective absorption
spectra.
Results and discussion
Monomer synthesis
An aromatic diamine with a pendent 4-methoxy-substituted
triphenylamine group, 4,49-diamino-40-methoxytriphenyl-
amine (mp = 150–152 uC), was prepared through the CsF-
mediated nucleophilic displacement reaction of p-anisidine
with 4-fluoronitrobenzene, followed by hydrazine Pd/C-
catalyzed reduction.32,33 The synthetic routines are outlined
in Scheme 1. Due to the inherent electron-donating nature
arising from the nitrogen atom through the conjugated
aromatic p-anisidine, the compound (1) could be readily
obtained in high purity and good yield (89%). 4,49-Diamino-
40-methoxyltriphenylamine (2) could be obtained by the
catalytic reduction of compound (1) with hydrazine mono-
hydrate or under a hydrogen atmosphere. Elemental analysis,
IR, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques were used
to identify the structures of the intermediate compounds (1)
and (2). The transformation of nitro to amino groups could be
monitored by changes in the IR spectra. The nitro groups
of compound (1) gave two characteristic bands at around
1579 cm21 and 1312 cm21 (–NO2 asymmetric and symmetric
stretching). After reduction, the characteristic absorptions of
the nitro group disappeared and the amino group showed the

hydrogen and carbon atoms of the recurring unit. The
resonance peaks appearing at 10.33 ppm in the 1H NMR
spectrum and at 164.3 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum also
support the formation of amide linkages.
Basic characterization
The solubility behavior of polyamides was tested qualitatively,
and the results are summarized in Table 2. All the polyamides
were highly soluble in polar solvents such as NMP, DMAc,
DMF, and DMSO, and the enhanced solubility could be
attributed to the introduction of the bulky pendent methoxy-
substituted TPA moiety into the repeat unit. Thus, the
excellent solubility makes these polymers potential candidates
for practical applications by spin- or dip-coating processes.
The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns of the
polyamides given in Fig. 4 indicate that the polymers were
essentially amorphous, revealing that the methoxy-substituted
TPA-containing polyamides do not form a well-packed
structure. The amorphous nature of these polyamides was
reflected not only in their good solubility but also agreed with
the UV-vis data of the polymers, which show that the UV-vis
absorption peaks of the polymers do not shift from the
solutions to the films, implying that there is no significant p–p
interaction aggregation between the polymer chains.
The thermal properties of the polyamides were investigated
by TGA and TMA. The results are summarized in Table 1.
Typical TGA curves of representative polyamide IIj in both
air and nitrogen atmospheres are shown in Fig. 5. All the
aromatic polyamides exhibited good thermal stability with
insignificant weight loss up to 430 uC in nitrogen. Their 10%
weight-loss temperatures in nitrogen and air were recorded at
475–505 and 465–520 uC, respectively. The carbonized residue
(char yield) of these aromatic polymers was more than 63% at
800 uC in nitrogen atmosphere. The high char yields of these
polymers could be ascribed to their high aromatic content. The
softening temperature (Ts) values of the polymer films were

and the onset absorption wavelength of polymer films, and the
results are also listed in Table 3. For example, the oxidation
half-wave potential for polyamide IIh has been determined as
0.76 V (Eonset = 0.62 V) vs Ag/AgCl. The external ferrocene/
ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox standard E1/2 (Fc/Fc
+) is 0.48 V vs
Ag/AgCl in CH3CN. Assuming that the HOMO energy for the
Fc/Fc+ standard is 4.80 eV with respect to the zero vacuum
level, the HOMO energy for polyamide IIh has been evaluated
to be 5.08 eV.
Electrochromic characterization
Electrochromism of the polyamide thin films was examined by
an optically transparent thin-layer electrode (OTTLE) coupled
with UV-vis spectroscopy. The electrode preparation and
solution condition were identical to those used in cyclic
voltammetry. The typical electrochromic transmittance spectra
of polyamide IIh are shown in Fig. 9. When the applied
potentials increased positively from 0.00 to 0.95 V, the peak of
absorption at 345 nm, characteristic for the neutral form
polyamide IIh, decreased gradually, while two new bands grew
up at 391 and 787 nm, respectively. The new spectral patterns
were assigned as those of the cationic radical polyamide IIh,
formed by electron removal from the lone pair on the nitrogen
atom on the TPA structure causing the structure to flatten off
and delocalise, so can absorb at longer wavelengths.
Meanwhile, the color of the IIh film changed from colorless
to green with high contrast of optical transmittance change
(DT%) up to 85% at 787 nm and 30% at 391 nm (as shown in
Fig. 9).
The color switching times were estimated by applying a
potential step, and the absorbance profiles were followed
(Fig. 10). The switching time was defined as the time required
to reach 90% of the full change in absorbance after the

interaction, for example, the incorporation of
bulky, packing-disruptive moieties, which hinder
the chain packing but do not affect the glass
transition temperature.9–21 It has been demon-
strated that aromatic polyamides and polyimides
containing bulky, propeller-shaped triphenyl-
amine unit were amorphous, had excellent or
enhanced solubility in organic solvents, and ex-
hibited high thermal stability.22–27 Recently, we
further studied the optoelectronic properties of
triphenylamine-based polyamides, polyimides,
polyhydrazides, and polyoxadiazoles and found
that these polymers exhibited stable photolu-
minscent and electrochromic characteristics in
addition to good ﬁlm-forming capability and high
thermal stability.28–31
The anodic oxidation of triphenylamine in
aprotic solvent is well studied.32 The one-electron
oxidation product, triphenylamine radical cation,
is not stable. The chemical follow-up reaction pro-
duces tetraphenylbenzidine by tail-to-tail (para
positions) coupling, with the loss of two protons
per dimer. When the phenyl groups are substi-
tuted at the para position, the coupling reactions
are greatly prevented. It has been well estab-
lished that incorporation of electron-donating
substitutents at the para position of triaryl-
amines affords stable radical cations.33,34 There-
fore, we synthesized the diamine monomer,
4,40-diamino-4@-tert-butyltriphenylamine (2), and
its derived polyamides and polyimides containing
electron-rich triphenylamine groups with tert-
butyl para substituted on the pendent phenyl
ring. We particularly targeted electron-donating
para substituent that lacks benzylic hydrogens.
Thus, this design obviates not only dimerization
pathways through the para position, but also the
possible dimerization through a benzylic position.
The tert-butyl groups are expected to increase the
solubility of the polymers and provide stability to
the triphenylamine in its oxidized form.

into a 7-cm glass Petri dish, which was placed in
a 90 8C oven overnight for the slow release of the
solvent, and then the ﬁlm was stripped off from
the glass substrate and further dried in vacuum
at 160 8C for 6 h. The obtained ﬁlms were about
90 lm thick and were used for X-ray diffraction
measurements, tensile tests, solubility tests, and
thermal analyses.
Measurements
IR spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 Fou-
rier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Ele-
mental analyses were run in a Heraeus VarioEL-
III CHN elemental analyzer. 1H and 13C-NMR
spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 500
FT-NMR system with tetramethylsilane as an in-
ternal standard. The inherent viscosities were
determined with an Ubbelohde or a Cannon-
Fenske viscometer at 30 8C. Wide-angle X-ray dif-
fraction measurements were performed at room
temperature (~25 8C) on a Shimadzu XRD-6000
X-ray diffractometer with a graphite monochro-
mator (operating at 40 kV and 30 mA), using
nickel-ﬁltered Cu–Ka radiation [k ¼ 1.5418 A˚ (Ang-
strom)]. The scanning rate was 28/min over a range
of 2h ¼ 10–408. Ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectra
of the polymer ﬁlms were recorded on a Jasco
UV/VIS V530 spectrometer. A universal tester
LLOYD LRXwith a load cell 5 kg was used to study
the stress–strain behavior of the samples. A gauge
length of 2 cm and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min
were used for this study. Measurements were per-
formed at room temperature with ﬁlm specimens
(0.5 cm width, 6 cm length), and an average of
three to ﬁve replicates were used. Thermogravi-
metric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Perki-
nElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were carried
out on approximately 4–6 mg of samples heated in
ﬂowing nitrogen or air (ﬂow rate ¼ 40 cm3/min) at
a heating rate of 20 8C/min. DSC analyses were
performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan
rate of 20 8C/min in ﬂowing nitrogen. Thermome-
chanical analysis (TMA) was determined with a
PerkinElmer TMA 7 instrument. The TMA experi-
ments were carried out from 50 to 350 8C at a scan
rate of 10 8C/min with a penetration probe 1.0 mm
in diameter under an applied constant load of 10
mN. Ts were taken as the onset temperatures of
probe displacement on the TMA traces. Electro-
chemistry was performed with a Bioanalytical Sys-
tem Model CV-27 potentiostat and a BAS X–Y
recorder. Voltammograms are presented with the
positive potential pointing to the left and with
increasing anodic currents pointing downwards.
Cyclic voltammetry was conducted with the use of
a three-electrode cell in which ITO (polymer ﬁlms
area about 0.7 cm  0.5 cm) was used as a working
electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxil-
iary electrode. All cell potentials were taken with
the use of a home-made Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) refer-
ence electrode. Ferrocene was used as an external
reference for calibration (+0.44 V versus Ag/AgCl).
Spectroelectrochemistry analyses were carried out
with an electrolytic cell, which was composed of a
1 cm cuvette, ITO as a working electrode, a plati-
num wire as an auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode. Absorption spectra were mea-
sured with a HP 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured
with a Varian Cary Eclipse ﬂuorescence spectro-
photometer.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Monomer Synthesis
4,40-Diamino-4@-tert-butyltriphenylamine (2) was
prepared by the double N-arylation of 4-tert-
butylaniline with 4-ﬂuoronitrobenzene, followed
by hydrazine Pd/C-catalytic reduction of the in-
termediate dinitro compound 1 according to the
synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1. Elemental
analysis, IR, and 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopic
techniques were used to identify the structures of
the intermediate compound 1 and the targeted
diamine monomer 2. The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR
spectra of the diamine monomer 2 are illustrated
in Figure 1. Assignments of each carbon and pro-
ton are also given in these ﬁgures, and these spec-
tra agree well with the proposed molecular struc-
ture of 2. The 1H-NMR spectra conﬁrm that the
nitro groups have been completely transformed
into the amino groups by the high ﬁeld shift of the
aromatic protons and by the resonance signals at
around 4.8 ppm corresponding to the amino pro-
tons. The resonance signals appeared at 1.2–
1.3 ppm in the 1H-NMR spectra and 34 ppm (qua-
ternary carbons) and 31 ppm (primary carbons)
in the 13C-NMR spectra are peculiar to the tert-
butyl group.
Polymer Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 2, polyamides 4a–4h were
prepared from the diamine 2 with various aro-
matic dicarboxylic acids (3a–3h) in NMP containing

acid)s, followed by thermal or chemical cyclodehy-
dration (Scheme 3). As shown in Table 2, the in-
herent viscosities of the poly(amic acid) precur-
sors were in the range 1.15–2.02 dL/g, indicating
the formation of high-molecular-weight polymers.
All of these poly(amic acid)s could be solution cast
into ﬂexible and tough ﬁlms, which were subse-
quently converted into tough polyimide ﬁlms by
extended heating at elevated temperatures. The
poly(amic acid)s also could be chemically cyclode-
hydrated to polyimides by treatment with a mix-
ture of pyridine and acetic anhydride. The com-
plete imidization of polymers was conﬁrmed by IR
spectra. All the polyimides showed the charac-
teristic absorption bands of the imide ring near
1780 (asymmetric C¼O stretch), 1720 (symmetric
C¼O stretch), 1380 (CN stretch), and 720 cm1
(imide ring deformation). A representative IR
spectrum for polyimide 6c is illustrated in Figure
2(b). There was no existence of the characteristic
absorption bands of the amide groups near 3300
(NH stretch) and 1650 (C¼O stretch) cm1,

for the polyimides derived from more rigid dianhy-
drides such as 6a–6c, the other polyimides and
almost all polyamides exhibited good solubility in a
variety of solvents such as NMP, DMAc, N,N-di-
methylformamide, and DMSO at room temperature
or upon heating at 70 8C. In general, these polymers
revealed an enhanced solubility as compared with
conventional aromatic polyamides and polyimides.
This can be attributed in part to the incorporation of
bulky, three-dimensional tert-butyltriphenylamino
groups, which retard dense chain packing and lead
to a decreased chain–chain interaction. Therefore,
the good solubility makes these polymers potential
candidates for practical applications in spin-coating
and inkjet-printing processes. All of the polymers
could afford ﬂexible and tough ﬁlms, and they were
amorphous in nature as evidenced by wide-angle
X-ray diffraction patterns. These ﬁlms exhibited
good mechanical properties with tensile strengths of
52–103 MPa, elongations at break of 3–22%, and
tensile moduli of 1.5–2.3 GPa. Most of the polymer
ﬁlms exhibited high tensile strengths and moderate
elongation to break; thus, they could be considered
as strong and ductile materials.
Thermal Properties
For the creation of useful devices based on or-
ganic light-emitting or charge-transporting mate-
rials, stable and high-quality amorphous glassy
materials are required. TGA, DSC, and TMAwere
used to investigate the thermal properties of the
polyamides and polyimides. The thermal behav-
ior data of all the polymers are summarized in
Table 3. The polyamides showed Tg values
between 282 and 302 8C. The lowest Tg value of
4b can be explained in terms of the ﬂexibility and
low rotation barrier of its diacid moiety. For com-
parison, previously reported29 Tg values of the
corresponding polyamides (40) without the tert-
butyl substituent are also listed in Table 4. In
most cases, the 4 series polyamides showed com-
parable Tg values to those of the corresponding 4
0
ones. This result indicated that the increased mo-
bility hindrance of the pendent tert-butyl groups
was balanced by the effects of increased free vol-
ume and decreased interchain interactions intro-
duced with the pendent groups. The Ts (may be
referred as apparent Tg) of the polyamide ﬁlms
were determined by the TMA method using a
loaded penetration probe. They were read from
the onset temperature of the probe displacement
on the TMA trace. The Ts values measured by
TMA are also listed in Table 3. As can be seen, in
all cases, the Ts values of the polyamides obtained
by TMA are lower than the Tg values measured by
the DSC experiments. These differences may be
attributed to the different heating story of the sam-
ples and the distinct nature of these two testing

polyamides exhibited strong UV–vis absorption
bands at 314–361 nm in DMAc solution, assigna-
ble to the p–p* transition resulting from the tri-
phenylamine moieties. Their PL spectra in DMAc
solution showed emission peaks around 421–
430 nm in the blue region. The DMAc solutions of
the polyamides were pale yellow and exhibited
a medium blue PL under irradiation with long
UV light (365 nm). Figure 3 shows the UV–vis
absorption and PL spectra of triphenylamine-
based diamine monomers and some typical poly-
amides 4a, 4a0, 4c, and 4c0. The absorption spec-
tra of the polyamides in the solid state are similar
(a little red-shifted) to those in DMAc solution.
Optical band gap (Eg) determined from the
absorption edge of the solid-state spectra of poly-
amides are found to be 2.86–3.15 eV. The PL spec-
tra of these polyamides in the solid state are
almost identical to those in dilute DMAc solution.
Charge transport in organic materials is believed
to be governed by the hopping process involving
redox reaction of charge transport molecules. The
redox behavior was investigated with cyclic vol-
tammetry for the cast ﬁlm on an ITO-coated glass
substrate as working electrode in dry acetonitrile
containing 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium per-
chlorate (TBAP) as an electrolyte. The anodic
scan provides information about ionization pro-
cesses so that the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) energy can be calculated. One
reversible redox wave was observed in these poly-
amides. Figure 4 shows the typical cyclic voltam-
mograns of the representative polyamides 4d and
4d0 recorded at scanning rate of 100 mV/s. As
depicted in Figure 4, scanning in a range from 0
to 1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl showed redox peaks with
color changes. The polyamide 4d showed an oxi-
dation wave of which a peak top is at around
1.0 V. The electron removal for polyamide 4d is
assumed to occur at the nitrogen atom of the tri-
phenylamine segments, which is electron-richer
than the amide nitrogen atoms. The color of the
ﬁlm changed from pale yellow to green because of
electrochemical oxidation of the polymer. The
energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO of the
investigated polyamides can be determined from
the oxidation half-wave potentials (E1/2) and the
onset absorption wavelength, and the results are
listed in Table 4. The external ferrocene/ferroce-
nium (Fc/Fc+) redox standard E1/2 is 0.44 V versus

Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile. The HOMO value for the
standard Fc is 4.80 eV with respect to the zero
vacuum energy level. Therefore, the HOMO
energy for polyamide 4d has been evaluated to be
5.18 eV. With use of the same method, the HOMO
positions of other polyamides were determined to
be in the range of 5.17–5.21 eV. As compared with
the corresponding structurally similar 40 series
polyamides, the 4 series polymers revealed a
slightly lower oxidation potential and a higher
HOMO level because of the incorporation of the
tert-butyl group at the para position of triphenyl-
amine moiety.
Polyimides 6c–6f present similar spectra in
NMP solutions and in the solid state, with kmax at
304–319 nm. They exhibited signiﬁcantly less
detectable ﬂuorescence than the polyamides. We
propose that the observed quenching of PL that
occurs in these polyimides is due to photoinduced
electron transfer from donor triphenylamine to
acceptor imide segment. Figure 5 shows the cyclic
voltammograns of polyimides 6e and 6e0 recorded
at scanning rate of 100 mV/s; they showed an oxi-
dation wave of which a peak top is around 1.15 V
(versus Ag/AgCl), with a color change from pale
yellow neutral state to the blue oxidized form.
The E1/2 values of polyimides 6c–6f were recorded
in the range 1.08–1.13 V, which are higher than
those of the polyamides because of the stronger
electron-withdrawing nature of the imide group.
Their HOMO energy levels were determined to be
5.45–5.49 eV (Table 4).

Anodically Electrochromic Aromatic Polyimides Containing
Dimethoxy-Activated Triphenylamine Moiety

Introduction. Electrochromism can be defined as the reversible
change in optical properties of a material resulting from
electrochemically induced redox states [1,2]. Color changes are
commonly between a transparent state, where the chromophore only
absorbs in the UV region, and a colored state, or between two colored
states in a given electrolyte solution. Electrochromic anti-glare car
rear-view mirrors have already been commercialized, with other
proposed applications of electrochromic materials including their use
in controllable light-reflective or light-transmissive devices for optical
information and storage, sunglasses, protective eyewear for the
military, controllable aircraft canopies, and glare-reduction systems
for offices and smart windows for use in cars and buildings [1-4].
Triarylamine derivativess have attracted considerable interest as
hole transport materials for use in multilayer organic
electroluminescence (EL) devices due to their relatively high
mobilities and their low ionization potentials [5,6]. The feasibility of
utilizing spin-coating and ink-jet printing process for large-area EL
devices and possibilities of various chemical modifications (to
improve emission efficiencies and allow patterning) make polymeric
materials containing triarylamine units very attractive. To enhance the
hole injection ability of polymeric emissive materials such as
poly(1,4-phenylenevinylene)s (PPV) and polyfluorenes (PF), there
have been several reports on PPV and PF derivatives involving
hole-transporting units such as triarylamine in the emissive
π-conjugated core/main chains or grafting them as side chains in a
polymer or attaching them onto the polymer chain-ends or the outer
surface of dendritic wedges [7-9].
Aromatic polyimides are characterized as highly thermally stable
polymers with a favorable balance of physical and chemical properties
[10]. However, rigidity of the backbone and strong interchain
interactions result in high melting or glass-transition temperatures (Tg)
and limited solubility in most organic solvents. These properties make
them generally intractable or difficult to process, thus restricting their
wide-spread applications. To overcome such a difficulty,
polymer-structure modification becomes necessary. One of the
common approaches for increasing solubility and processability of
aromatic polyimides without sacrificing high thermal stability is the
introduction of bulky, packing-disruptive groups into the polymer
backbone. We have demonstrated that aromatic polyimides containing
bulky, propeller-shaped triphenylamine (TPA) unit are amorphous,
have increased solubility in organic solvents, and exhibit excellent
thin-film-forming capability and high thermal stability [11-13].
Furthermore, these TPA-based polyimides also show interesting
electrochromic behavior.
The anodic oxidation pathways of TPA are well studied [14].
The unsubstituted TPA may undergo coupling-deprotonation to form
tetraphenylbenzidine after the formation of the initial monocation
radical. It has been well established that incorporation of
electron-donating substituents such as methoxy group at the para
position of TPA prevents the coupling reactions and affords stable
radical cations [15-18]. Therefore, we synthesized the diamine
monomer, 4,4’-diamino-2,4”-dimethoxytriphenylamine (2), and its
derived polyimides containing electroactive TPA units with
electron-donating methoxy groups para and ortho substituted on the
pendent phenyl ring. We anticipitated that the electrochromic films
obtained from the present polyimides would exhibit an enhanced
stability upon redox switching.
Synthesis of 2,4-Dimethoxy-4’,4’-diaminotriphenylamine
(2). The triphenylamine-containing diamine monomer,
2,4-dimethoxy-4’,4’-dinitrotriphenylamine (2), was prepared by a
two-step reaction sequence outlined in Scheme 1. The target
TPA-based diamine monomer 2, was successfully synthesized by the
cesium fluoride (CsF)-mediated double N-arylation of
2,4-dimethoxyaniline with two equivalent 4-fluoronitrobenzene
followed by catalytic reduction of the intermediate dinitro compound
1 using Pd/C and hydrazine in refluxing ethanol. The proposed
molecular structure of 2 was confirmed by elemental analysis, IR and
1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
Synthesis of Polyimides. Polyimides 6a-6f were prepared
through a conventional two-step method by the reactions of equal
molar amounts of diamine 2 with various aromatic dianhydrides (5a to
5f) to form poly(amic acid)s, followed by thermal or chemical
cyclodehydration (Scheme 2). The inherent viscosities of the
poly(amic acid) precursors were in the range 2.44-2.87 dL/g,
indicating the formation of high-molecular-weight polymers. All of
these poly(amic acid)s could be cast into flexible and tough films,
which were subsequently converted into tough polyimide films by
extended heating at elevated temperatures (up to 300oC). The
poly(amic acid)s also could be chemically cyclodehydrated to
polyimides by treatment with a mixture of pyridine and acetic
anhydride.

Thermal Stability. Thermal properties of all polymers were
evaluated by DSC, TMA and TGA. The thermal behavior data of the
polyamides are summarized in Table 1. Tg of these polyamides was
obtained from the middlepoint temperature of baseline shift on the
second DSC heating trace (heating rate = 20oC/min) after rapid
cooling from 400 oC. All the polyimides except 6a showed clear Tg in
the range of 269～307oC. The Ts values of these polymer film samples
were also measured with TMA by the penetration method; they were
observed in the range 265~308oC. All of the polymers exhibited good
thermal stability; the Td of polyimides 6a-6f at a 10% weight loss
temperatures were in the range of 470-508 oC in nitrogen and
504-556oC in air, respectively. A typical set of TGA curves of
polymer 6a in air and nitrogen atmospheres are depicted in Fig. 1.

A series of novel aromatic poly(amine-amide)s with pendent N-phenylindole units having inherent viscosities of 0.75-1.28 dL/g were prepared via the direct phosphorylation polycondensation reaction of 
an indole-derived triphenylamine-containing dicarboxylic acid, 4,4’-dicarboxy-4’’-(N-indolyl)triphenylamine, with various aromatic diamines. The poly(amine-amide)s were readily soluble in various 
organic solvents and could be cast into flexible and strong films. The polymer films have good thermal stability with glass-transition temperatures of 254-316 ℃ and 10% weight loss temperature in excess 
of 500 ℃. These polymers showed ultraviolet visible absorption maxima at 337-353 nm and blue fluorescence emission maxima at 449-465 nm in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solution with fluorescence 
quantum yields ranging from 1.0% to 15.0%. Cyclic voltammograms of the poly(amine-amide) films prepared by casting polymer solutions onto the indium tin oxide coated glass substrate exhibited one 
oxidative redox couple around 1.10-1.21 V (oxidation half-wave potential) versus Ag/AgCl in an acetonitrile solution.
ABSTRACT
Triarylamines have attracted considerable interest as hole transport 
materials for use in multilayer organic electroluminescence (EL) devices due 
to their relatively high mobilities and their low ionization potentials.1-2 The 
feasibility of utilizing spin-coating and ink-jet printing process for large-area 
EL devices and possibilities of various chemical modifications (to improve 
emission efficiencies and allow patterning) make polymeric materials 
containing triarylamine units very attractive.3-4 To enhance the hole injection 
ability of polymeric emissive materials such as poly(1,4-
phenylenevinylene)s (PPV) and polyfluorenes (PF), there have been several 
reports on PPV and PF derivatives involving hole-transporting units such as 
triarylamine or carbazole groups in the emissive π-conjugated core/main 
chains5-7 or grafting them as side chains in a polymer8 or attaching them 
onto the polymer chain-ends or the outer surface of dendritic wedges.
Indole is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound. It has a bicyclic
structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-
membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. The indole structure can be 
found in many organic compounds like the amino acid tryptphan and in 
trytophan-containing protein, in alkaloids, and in pigments. Certain indole
derivatives were important dyestuffs until the end of the 19th century. In the 
1930s, interest in indole intensified when it became known that the indole
nucleus is present in many important alkaloids, as well as in tryptophan and 
auxins, and it remains an active area research today.9 To the best of our 
knowledge, there have never been attempts to incorporate the indole
structure into high-performance polymers. Herein we describe the 
preparation of the novel indole-based diamine monomers, 4,4’-dicarboxy-
4’’-(N-indolyl)triphenylamine, and its derived poly(amine-amide)s
containing the electro-rich triphenylamine core with indolyl para-substituted 
on the pendent phenyl ring. The general properties of the resulting polymers 
such as inherent viscosities, solubility, film-formimg ability, crystallinity, 
thermal properties, electrochemical behavior, and photoluminescence are 
also reported. The incorporation of bulky, three-dimensional N-
indolyltriphenylamino moiety was expected to hinder close chain packing 
and provide enhanced solubility in organic solvents. In addition, the indole
group in each repeat unit allows chemical modification for specific 
application; for example, through electrophilic substitution or 
electrochemical coupling.

Synthesis of 4,4’-Dicarboxy-4”-(N-indolyl)triphenylamine (4)
The new bulky indole-substituted triphenylamine-containing 
dicarboxylic acid monomer 4 was successfully synthesized by the 
alkaline hydrolysis reaction of the dinitrile compound, 4,4’-
dicyano-4”-(N-indolyl)triphenylamine (3), which was resulted from 
the condensation reaction of N-(4-aminophenyl)indole (2) with 4-
fluorobenzonitrile in dried DMSO using sodium hydride as the 
strong base (Scheme 1). IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic 
techniques were used to identify the structures of the dinitrile
intermediate and the dicarboxylic acid monomer. The IR spectra 
(Figure 1) of dinitrile compound 3 gave a characteristic sharp peak 
at 2225 cm-1 peculiar to the cyano group. After hydrolysis, the 
characteristic absorption of the cyano group disappeared, and the 
carboxylic acid group showed a typical carbonyl absorption band at 
1680 cm-1 (C=O stretching) together with the appearance of broad 
bands in the region of 2700-3400 cm-1 (-OH stretching) (Figure 1). 
Figure 2 illustrates the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the 
targeted dicarboxylic acid monomer. Assignments of each carbon 
and proton are assisted by the two-dimensional NMR spectra, and 
these spectra agree well with the proposed molecular structure of 
diacid monomer 4.

A typical example for polymerization is as follows. A mixture of
equimolar amounts(1.0 mmol) of the dicarboxylic acid monomer 4 (0.4485 g) 
and 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorene (5f) (0.3485 g), 1.5 mL of NMP, 0.2 g of 
CaCl2, 1.2 mL of TPP, and 0.3 mL of pyridine was heated with stirring at 120 
℃ for 3 h. The resulting viscous solution was poured slowly with stirring into 
150 mL of methanol, giving rise to a fibrous precipitate. The precipitated 
product was collected by filtration, washed repeatedly with methanol and hot 
water, and dried to give a quantitative yield of poly(amine-amide) 6f. The 
inherent viscosity of the polymer was 0.76 dL/g, measured in DMAc 
(containing 5 wt % LiCl) at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL at 30 ℃. The other 
poly(amine-amide)s were synthesized in a similar procedure.

2.2. Synthesis of Poly(amine-amide)s 
A typical example for polymerization is as follows. A mixture of 
equimolar amounts(1.0 mmol) of the dicarboxylic acid monomer 4 
(0.4485 g) and 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorene (5f) (0.3485 g), 1.5 
mL of NMP, 0.2 g of CaCl2, 1.2 mL of TPP, and 0.3 mL of 
pyridine was heated with stirring at 120  ℃ for 3 h. The resulting 
viscous solution was poured slowly with stirring into 150 mL of 
methanol, giving rise to a fibrous precipitate. The precipitated 
product was collected by filtration, washed repeatedly with 
methanol and hot water, and dried to give a quantitative yield of 
poly(amine-amide) 6f. The inherent viscosity of the polymer was 
0.76 dL/g, measured in DMAc (containing 5 wt % LiCl) at a 
concentration of 0.5 g/dL at 30 ℃. The other poly(amine-amide)s 
were synthesized in a similar procedure. 
 
3. Result and Discussion 
3.1. Polymer Synthesis  
A series of novel 4-indolyltriphenylamine-containing aromatic 
poly(amine-amide)s 6a-6h were prepared from the phosphorylation 
polycondensation reaction32 of the dicarboxylic acid monomer 4 
and aromatic diamines 5a-5h using TPP and pyridine as 
condensing agents (Scheme 2). All the polymerizations proceeded 
homogeneously throughout the reaction and afforded clear, highly 
viscous polymer solutions. These polymers precipitated in a tough, 
fiber-like form when the resulting polymer solutions were slowly 
poured with stirring into methanol. These poly(amine-amide)s were 
obtained in almost quantitative yields, with ηinh values in the range 
of 0.75-1.80 dL/g, as shown in Table 1.

3.2. Polymer Solubility and Film Morphology  
The qualitative solubility properties of poly(amine-amide)s 6a-6h 
in several organic solvents at 10% (w/v) are also summarized in 
Table 1. All the polymers exhibited good solubility in polar organic 
solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF and DMSO, and they could 
be easily solution-cast into flexible and tough films. All the 
polymer films were amorphous in nature as evidenced by 
wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns. The high solubility and the 
amorphous nature of these polymers can be attributable to the 
incorporation of the bulky propeller-shaped triphenylamine unit 
along the backbone and asymmetric indole moiety as pendent 
group.

3.3. Thermal Properties 
The thermal behavior data of these polymers are summarized in 
Table 2. They showed high glass-transition temperatures (Tg) in the 
range of 254-305  by DSC. The ℃ Ts value was read from the onset 
temperature of the probe displacement on the TMA trace. Figure 3 
shows a typical TMA curve of polymer 6g. The Ts values of these 
poly(amine-amide)s range from 245 to 303 . In general, the ℃ Ts 
values obtained by TMA are comparable to the Tg values measured 
by the DSC experiments. The thermal stability of

Abstract 
A new family of wholly aromatic polyamides containing 
halogen-substituted triphenylamine units were synthesized by the 
phosphorylation polyamidation reactions of 4,4’-diamino-4”-halo- 
triphenylamines with terephthalic acid (TPA) and isophthalic acid 
(IPA), respectively, in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone using triphenyl 
phosphite and pyridine as condensing agents, where the halogen 
atoms included F, Cl, Br and I. All polyamides were readily soluble 
in polar organic solvents. These polymers were amorphous and 
most of them could afford flexible and tough films. They had 
useful levels of thermal stability associated with high 
glass-transition temperatures (255–330oC), 10% weight-loss 
temperatures in excess of 442℃ in nitrogen, and char yields at 
800℃ in nitrogen higher than 66%. Cyclic voltammograms of the 
polyamide films on an indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass 
substrate exhibited one reversible redox couple at around 0.83-0.90 
V versus Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile solution. The polymer films 
revealed excellent stability of electrochromic characteristics, with 
coloration change from a pale yellowish neutral state to a green 
oxidized state. 
 
Keywords: polyamide, triphenylamine, halogen, electrochromism, 
electrochemistry.  
 
1. Introduction  
Wholly aromatic polyamides (aramids) are characterized as 
high-performance polymers with a favorable balance of thermal 
and mechanical properties. However, rigidity of the backbone and 
strong interchain interactions result in high melting or 
glass-transition temperatures (Tg) and limited solubility in most 
organic solvents. These properties make them generally intractable 
or difficult to process, thus restricting their wide-spread 
applications. To overcome such a difficulty, polymer-structure 
modification becomes necessary. One of the common approaches 
for increasing solubility and processability of aramids without 
much impairing their thermal and mechanical properties is the 
incorporation of bulky, packing-disruptive groups into the polymer 
backbone.1 We have demonstrated that aromatic polyamides 
containing bulky, propeller-shaped triphenylamine unit are 
amorphous, have good solubility in organic solvents, and exhibit 
excellent thin-film-forming capability and high thermal stability.2 
Furthermore, many triphenylamine-based polymers also show 
interesting light-emitting and electrochromic behavior.3-7 
It has been demonstrated that the introduction of halogen 
substituents into the polyamide backbones generally led to an 
increase in solubility and Tg because of the great volume of halogen 
atoms and the polarity of carbon-halogen bonds.8-9 To understand 
the effect of halogen substitution on the properties of 
triphenylamine-containing aramids, we prepare four 
4,4’-diamino-4”-halotriphenylamines and their derived 
triphenylamine-based polyterephthalamides and polyisophthal- 
amides. The solubility, thermal, electrochemical, and 
electrochromic properties of these halogen-substituted polyamides 
were compared with those of the parent polyamides without the 
halogen substitution.

2.1. Monomer Synthesis 
2.1.1. Synthesis of 4-Halo-4’,4”-dinitrotriphenylamine (1) 
  A typical example of the synthesis of 4-fluoro-4’,4”- 
dinitrotriphenylamine (1-F) is described as follows: A mixture of 
11.1 g (0.1 mol) of 4-fluoroaniline, 28.5 g (0.2 mol) of 
4-fluoronitrobenzene, and 30.4 g (0.2 mol) of cesium fluoride (CsF) 
in 100 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was heated with stirring 
at 140 oC for 12 h. After cooling, the mixture was poured into 500 
mL mixed solution of ethanol/water (1:1), and the olivine 
precipitate was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with 
water. Recrystallization from DMF/methanol yielded 26.5 g of the 
desired dinitro compound 1-F as yellow crystals in 75 % yield [mp 
= 295-296 oC, measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
at a scan rate of 2oC/min]. IR (KBr)：1321, 1551 cm-1 (-NO2 str.).

2.1.2. Synthesis of 4,4’-Diamino-4”-fluorotriphenylamine (2-F) 
In a 300 mL round-bottom flask, 17.7 g (0.05 mol) of dinitro 
compound 1-F, 0.2 g of 10 wt% Pd/C, 10 mL hydrazine 
monohydrate and 100 mL of ethanol was heated in nitrogen flow at 
a reflux temperature for 12 h. The solution was filtered hot to 
remove Pd/C and then allowed to cool to room temperature to 
afford 11.7 g (80% yield) of diamine 2-F as colorless needles; mp = 
175~177 oC (DSC, 2oC/min). IR (KBr): 3407, 3324 cm-1 (-NH2 
str.). ANAL. Calcd for C18H16N3F (293.34): C, 73.70 %; H, 5.50 %;

2.1.2. Synthesis of 4,4’-Diamino-4”-iodotriphenylamine (2-I) 
In a 1000 mL round-bottom flask, 23 g (0.05 mol) of nitro 
compound 1-I, 90.3 g(0.05 mol) of SnCl2‧2H2O and 400 mL of 
ethanol was heated in nitrogen flow at a reflux temperature for 4 h. 
After cooling to room temperature, the solution was filtered to 
remove the impurities. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced 
pressure to remove the ethanol. The pH is made slightly basic (pH 
7-8) by addition of 1M aqueous sodium hydroxide before being 
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is thoroughly 
washed with brine, treated with charcoal and dried over anhydrous 
magnesium sulphate. Evaporation of the solvent leaves 17.7 g (88.2

2.2. Polymer Synthesis 
The preparation of polyamide PTPA-F was used as an example 
to illustrate the general synthetic procedure to produce the 
polyamides. A 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic 
stirrer was charged with 0.4400 g (1.50 mmol) of diamine 
momomer 2-F, 0.2492 g (1.50 mmol) of terephthalic acid (TPA), 
1.5 mL of triphenyl phosphate (TPP), 3 mL of NMP, 0.8 mL of 
pyridine, and 0.2 g of calcium chloride (CaCl2). The reaction 
  
3.3. Polymer Properties 
All the polyamides were amorphous in nature as evidenced by 
their wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns. These 
polymers were readily soluble in highly polar solvents, such as 
NMP, DMAc, DMF and DMSO, and in m-cresol as well. No 
appreciable difference in solubility was observed among the 
halogen-substituted polyamides. The solubility of these polyamides 
was higher than that of nonhalogenated polyamides, which did not 
dissolve in DMF, DMSO, and m-cresol unless upon heating. The 
high solubility of these halo-polyamides can be well explained by 
the packing-disruptive triphenylamine unit in the polymer 
backbone and the pendent halogen atoms which resulted in 
decreased chain packing efficiency and intermolecular interactions. 
One of the factors contributing to the enhanced solubility was the 
characteristic amorphous nature caused by the introduction of 
bulky 4-halotriphenylamine moieties.  
Thermal properties of all polymers were evaluated by DSC, 
TMA and TGA. The thermal behavior data of the polyamides are 
summarized in Table 2. The TGA curves of PTPA-X polyamides in 
nitrogen atmosphere are reproduced in Figure 1. The T10 values of 
the halogen-substituted polyamides, a measure of the thermal 
stability, were also influenced by the nature of the halogen. The Br- 
and I-substituted polyamides revealed a relatively lower T10 value 
because of the lower bond dissociation energy of C-Br and C-I. 
This is consistent with earlier results reported in literature.8,9 For 
the PPTA-X polyamides, all the halogenated PPTAs showed higher 
Tg than the unsubstituted PPTA-H. The relatively higher Tg (306 oC) 
of PPTA-I compared to other halogenated ones can be explained by 
the increased steric hindrance by the most bulky iodine substitutent. 
Nevertheless, no marked difference in Tg values was observed with 
respect to the halogen substituents among the PTPA-F, PPTA-Cl, 
and PPTA-Br. This is probably ascribed to the fact that the increase 
in the molecular mobility restriction was compensated by the 
simultaneous increase in fractional free volume between polymer 
chains. Polymer PIPA-H did not follow the trend because hydrogen 
has a lower volume than fluorine and PIPA-H showed a Tg (267 oC) 
higher than that of PIPA-F (255 oC). Denser chain packing or less 
free volume of PIPA-H may account in this case for the elevation 
of Tg of PIPA-H. The Ts values of the polymer film samples were 
also measured with TMA by the penetration method. The Ts values 
of the polyamide films were in the range 250~289 oC.

The optical and electrochemical properties of the polyamides 
were investigated by UV–vis and PL spectroscopy and cyclic 
voltammetry (CV). The dilute solutions of these polymers in NMP 
exhibited strong UV–vis absorption bands at 316~354 nm, which 
we ascribe to the π-π* transitions mainly originating from the 
triphenylamine moieties. In comparison to the dilute solutions, the 
absorption spectra of the polyamide thin films appeared slightly 
broadened, probably because of aggregation formation, but without 
a large spectral shift. Upon excitation at 350 nm, the dilute 
solutions in NMP showed PL maxima around 404-453 nm in the 
violet-to-blue region. The electrochemical properties of the 
polyamides were investigated by CV. In acetonitrile (CH3CN), 
using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the 
supporting electrolyte, a reversible oxidation process was observed.

A new triphenylamine-containing diamine monomer, 2,4-dimethoxy-4’,4’’-diaminotriphenylamine (2), was synthesized from readily available reagents and was reacted with various aromatic or 
aliphatic dicarboxylic acids to produce a series of polyamides (4a-i) containing 2,4-dimethoxy-activated triphenylamine units. All the resulting polyamides were readily soluble in polar organic solvents and 
could be solution cast into tough and flexible films. These polymers exhibited good thermal stability with glass-transition temperatures of 243-289oC and softening temperatures of 235-280oC, 10% weight-
loss temperatures in excess of 500 oC in nitrogen, and char yields at 800 oC in nitrogen higher than 65%. The redox behaviors of the polymers were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Most of these 
polymers showed two reversible oxidation processes in the first CV scan. The polymers also displayed low ionization potentials as a result of their 2,4-dimethoxy-activated triphenylamine moieties. In 
addition, the polymers displayed excellent stability of electrochromic characteristics with coloration change from a pale yellowish neutral state to a green or blue-violet oxidized state. After over 2000 
cyclic scans, the polymer films still exhibited good electrochemical and electrochromic stability.
INTRODUCTION
Electrochromism can be defined as the reversible change in optical properties of a material resulting from 
electrochemically induced redox states. Color changes are commonly between a transparent state, where the 
chromophore only absorbs in the UV region, and a colored state, or between two colored states in a given electrolyte 
solution. The electrochromic material may exhibit several colors and be termed polyelectrochromic. Electrochromic
anti-glare car rear-view mirrors have already been commercialized, with other proposed applications of 
electrochromic materials including their use in controllable light-reflective or light-transmissive devices for optical 
information and storage, sunglasses, protective eyewear for the military, controllable aircraft canopies, and glare-
reduction systems for offices and smart windows for use in cars and buildings.1,2
Triarylamines have attracted considerable interest as hole transport materials for use in multilayer organic 
electroluminescence (EL) devices due to their relatively high mobilities and their low ionization potentials.3 The 
feasibility of utilizing spin-coating and ink-jet printing process for large-area EL devices and possibilities of various 
chemical modifications (to improve emission efficiencies and allow patterning) make polymeric materials containing 
triarylamine units very attractive. To enhance the hole injection ability of polymeric emissive materials such as 
poly(1,4-phenylenevinylene)s (PPV) and polyfluorenes (PF), there have been several reports on PPV and PF 
derivatives involving hole-transporting units such as triarylamine in the emissive π-conjugated core/main chains or 
grafting them as side chains in a polymer or attaching them onto the polymer chain-ends or the outer surface of 
dendritic wedges.4-6
Aromatic polyamides are characterized as highly thermally stable polymers with a favorable balance of physical 
and chemical properties.7 However, rigidity of the backbone and strong interchain interactions result in high melting 
or glass-transition temperatures (Tg) and limited solubility in most organic solvents. These properties make them 
generally intractable or difficult to process, thus restricting their wide-spread applications. To overcome such a 
difficulty, polymer-structure modification becomes necessary. One of the common approaches for increasing 
solubility and processability of aromatic polyamides without sacrificing high thermal stability is the introduction of 
bulky, packing-disruptive groups into the polymer backbone. We have demonstrated that aromatic polyamides 
containing bulky, propeller-shaped triphenylamine (TPA) unit are amorphous, have good solubility in organic 
solvents, and exhibit excellent thin-film-forming capability and high thermal stability.8,9 Furthermore, many TPA-
based polymers also show interesting light-emitting and electrochromic behavior.10,11
The anodic oxidation pathways of TPA are well studied.12 The unsubstituted TPA may undergo coupling-
deprotonation to form tetraphenylbenzidine after the formation of the initial monocation radical. It has been well 
established that incorporation of electron-donating substituents such as methoxy group at the para position of TPA 
prevents the coupling reactions and affords stable radical cations.13,14 Therefore, we synthesized the diamine
monomer, 4,4’-diamino-2,4”-dimethoxytriphenylamine (2), and its derived polyamides containing electroactive TPA 
units with electron-donating methoxy groups para and ortho substituted on the pendent phenyl ring. We anticipitated
that the electrochromic films obtained from the present polyamides would be stable to multiple redox switching.

2.2. Synthesis of Polyamides 
The preparation of polyamide 4a was used as an example to 
illustrate the general synthetic procedure to produce the 
polyamides. A 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a 
magnetic stirrer was charged with 0.5031 g (1.50 mmol) of 
diamine momomer 2, 0.2492 g (1.50 mmol) of terephthalic acid 
(5a), 1.5 mL of TPP, 2.5 mL of NMP, 0.4 mL of pyridine, and 0.15 
g of calcium chloride (CaCl2). The reaction mixture was heated 
with stirring at 110oC for 3 h. The resulting polymer solution was 
poured slowly into excess of stirring methanol giving rise to a 
stringy, fiber-like precipitate that was collected by filtration, 
washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol, and dried. The 
other polyamides were prepared by an analogous procedure. 
 
3. Result and Discussion 
3.1 Polymer Synthesis  
According to the phosphorylation technique described by 
Yamazaki and co-workers,15 a series of novel TPA-based aromatic 
polyamides, 4a-i, with dimethoxy para and othro-substituted on 
the pendent phenyl ring were prepared from the diamine 2 and 
various aromatic or aliphatic dicarboxylic diacids (3a-i) by the 
direct polycondensation reaction with triphenyl phosphite (TPP) 
and pyridine as condensing agents (Scheme 2). The polyamides 
were produced with moderate to high inherent viscosities ranging 
from 0.52 to 1.42 dL/g (Table 1). The molecular weights of all the 
polyamides are sufficiently high to permit the formation of flexible 
and tough films by casting from their DMAc solutions.

3.2 Polymer Properties 
All the polyamides were readily soluble in amide-type polar 
aprotic solvents (such as NMP, DMAc, and DMF). The high 
solubility of these polyamides is apparently due in part to the 
presence of the packing-disruptive TPA unit in the polymer 
backbone, and the dimethoxy pendent groups which resulted in 
increased chain packing distances and decreased intermolecular 
interactions. All the polyamides could afford flexible and tough 
films, and they were amorphous in nature as evidenced by 
wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns. One of the factors 
contributing to the enhanced solubility was the characteristic 
amorphous nature caused by the introduction of bulky TPA core. 
Thermal properties of all polymers were evaluated by DSC, TMA 
and TGA. The thermal behavior data of the polyamides are 
summarized in Table 2. Tg of these polyamides was obtained from 
the middlepoint temperature of baseline shift on the second DSC

A series of highly stable anodic electrochromic polyamides 
have been readily obtained from 2,4-dimethoxy-4’,4’’- 
diaminotriphenylamine and various dicarboxylic acids via direct 
phosphorylation polyamidation. These polyamides were 
amorphous and exhibited excellent film-forming ability. In 
addition to high Tg and Ts values and good thermal stability, the 
polymers also revealed electrochromic properties, changing color 
from pale yellow neutral state to green or blue-purple oxidized 
state. After over 2000 cyclic scans, the polymer films still 
exhibited good electrochemical and electrochromic stability. Thus, 
these polymers may find optoelectronic applications as new 
hole-transporting and electrochromic materials due to their proper 
HOMO values and stable electrochromic behavior.

Abstract 
Two family of organosoluble polyhydrazides and 
poly(amide-hydrazide)s were successfully synthesized via the 
Yamazaki phosphorylation reaction from a newly synthesized 
dicarboxylic acid, 4-tert-butyl-4’,4”-dicarboxytriphenylamine (2) 
and 4,4’-dicarboxytriphenylamine (2’) with terephthalic 
dihydrazide (TPH), isophthalic dihydrazide (IPH) and 
p-aminobenzoyl hydrazide (p-ABH), respectively. Differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that these hydrazide 
polymers had glass-transition temperatures (Tg) in the range of 
217~247 oC and could be thermally cyclodehydrated into the 
corresponding oxadiazole polymers in the range of 300~400 oC. 
The resulting poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s had useful levels of thermal 
stability associated with high Tg (264~291 oC), 10 % weight-loss 
temperatures in excess of 490 oC, and char yield at 800 oC in 
nitrogen higher than 48 %. These organo-soluble polyhydrazides 
and poly(amide-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s exhibited maximum UV-Vis 
absorption at 348~380 and 374~392 nm in NMP solution. Their 
photoluminescence spectra in NMP solution showed maximum 
bands around 431~535 nm in the blue and green region. The 
poly(amide-hydrazide) (III-ABH) derived from diacid 2 and 
p-ABH showed a blue photoluminescence at 447 nm with a 54 % 
quantum yield in NMP solution. The hole-transporting and 
electrochromic properties were examined by electrochemical 
methods. Cyclic voltammograms of the polyhydrazide films cast on 
the an indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate exhibited 
half-wave potentials (E1/2) at 1.26~1.37 V versus Ag/AgCl in dry 
acetonitrile solution, and they revealed electrochromic 
characteristics with a color change from colorless to pale green at 
applied potentials switched between 0 and 1.5 V. 
 
Keywords: triphenylamine, polyhydrazide, polyoxadiazole, 
photoluminescence, electrochromism, electrochemistry.  
 
1. Introduction  
Since the first report of polymer light-emitting devices (PLEDs) 
based on poly(p-phenylenevinylene) by Burroughes et al.,1 research 
on photoluminescent and electroluminescent conjugated polymers 
has intensified. Organic semiconducting materials are desirable for 
the fabrication of electronic devices which can be processed 
inexpensively onto flexible substrates for applications in thin film 
transistors, organic light emitting diodes, and photovoltaic devices. 
The design of systems incorporating both donor and acceptor 
chromophores is of particular interest in applications in bipolar 
field effect transistors, solar cells and EL devices. One of the 
technology devices is PLED-based full-color flat panel displays.2 
PLEDs have several advantages over small-molecule LEDs such as 
low cost due to solution processing and advantages over liquid 
crystal displays in that they are visible over a much wider range.3 
Highly electron-rich and redox-active compounds such as 
triphenylamine (TPA) have attracted considerable interest as hole 
transport materials for use in multilayer organic 
electroluminescence (EL) devices4-8  
Heterocyclic aromatic poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s are a class of 
chemically resistant and thermally stable polymers.9,10 Recently, 
1,3,4-oxadiazole-containing conjugated polymers have been widely 
investigated and applied as electron transport or emission layers in 
polymer light-emitting diodes (LEDs).11,12 The primary reason for 
this use is the high photoluminescent quantum yield in the visible 
region that characterizes many of these materials, combined with 
the advantage of simple processability into flexible, mechanically 
robust films or thin layers. More specifically, conjugated polymers 
present excellent possibilities towards the fabrication of low cost 
and efficient large area flat-panel displays due to their unique 
processability, band gap tunability and mechanical flexibility. 
Unfortunately, aromatic polyoxadiazoles are difficult to process 
owing to their infusible and insoluble properties and their tendency 
to be brittle. To overcome these limitations, polymer-structure 
modification becomes necessary. Recently, we have reported the 
series of soluble aromatic polyamides, polyimides, polyoxadiazoles 
bearing triphenylamine units in the main chain.13-21 Because of the 
incorporation of bulky, propeller-shaped triphenylamine units 
along the polymer backbone, all the polymers were amorphous, 
showed good solubility in many organic solvents, good 
film-forming capability, and exhibited high thermal stability. 
This article reports the synthesis of polyhydrazides and  
poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s containing bulky 
4-tert-butyltriphenylamine moiety. Solubility, thermal, optical, and 
electrochemical properties of these polymers are reported and 
compared with those of structurally related ones from 
4,4’-dicarboxytriphenylamine.22
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Monomer synthesis 
2.1.1. 4-tert-Butyl-4’,4”-dicyanotriphenylamine (1) 
  A mixture of 4.5 g (0.11 mol) of sodium hydride in 80 mL of 
DMSO was stirred at room temperature. To the mixture 7.46 g 
(0.05 mol) of 4-tert-butylaniline and 12.1 g (0.1 mol) of 
4-fluorobenzonitrile were added in sequence. The mixture was 
heated with stirring at 120 oC for 24 hours, and then precipitated 
into 1500 mL of a saturated NaCl aqueous solution. The product 
was filtered and recrystallized from ethanol give 9.34 g (53 % in 
yield) of yellowish plate crystal with a mp of 188-189 oC by DSC 
at scanning rate 2 oC/min. IR (KBr): 2217 cm-1 (-C≡N, stretching). 
1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ, ppm): 7.51 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 4H, Ha), 
7.40 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, Hd), 7.11 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H, Hb), 7.05 (d, J 
= 8.5 Hz, 2H, Hc).13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ, ppm): 150.68 
(C7), 150.18 (C1), 142.56 (C4), 133.89 (C9), 127.63 (C3), 126.99 
(C2), 123.10 (C8), 119.44 (-CN), 105.87 (C10), 35.05 (C5) ,31.75 
(C6). Anal. Calcd for C24H21N3 (351.45): C, 82.02 %; H, 6.02 %; N, 
11.96 %. Found: C, 82.22 %; H, 5.92 %; N, 11.86 %. Crystal data: 
yellow crystal grown during slow crystallization in ethanol (0.5 × 
0.4 × 0.3 mm), monoclinic with a = 12.3393(4) Å, b = 13.3826(4) 
Å; α = 90°, β = 97.8470(10)°, and γ = 90°, where the density of the 
crystal was 1.150 Mg/m3 for Z = 4 and V = 2028.97(12) Å3. 
 
2.2.2. 4-tert-Butyl-4’,4”-dicarboxytriphenylamine (2) 
A mixture of 3.56 g (63.5 mmol) of potassium hydroxide and 
2.23 g (6.35 mmol) of the obtained dinitrile compound 1 in 30 mL 
of ethanol and 30 mL of distillated water was stirred at 
approximately 100 oC until no further ammonia was generated. The 
time taken to reach this stage was about 2 days. The solution was 
cooled, and the pH value was adjusted by conc. hydrochloric acid 
to near 3. The white precipitate formed was collected by filtration, 
washed thoroughly with water, and dried in vacuo at 80 oC to give 
2.05 g (83 % in yield) of white powder with a mp of 291~293 oC 
by DSC at scanning rate 2 oC/min. IR (KBr): 1686 cm-1 (C=O, 
stretching), 2700~3400 cm-1 (O-H). 1H NMR (500 MHz; DMSO-d6, 
1,3,4-oxadiazole ring vibration at around 1500~1600 (C=N) and 
1182 cm-1 (C-O-C). DSC also could be used to investigate 
cyclization to the oxadiazole structure. The main endothermic peak 
revealed the cyclodehydration reaction of hydrazide group with 
water evolution in the range of 300~400 oC. 
 
3.3. Polymer solubility and film morphology 
The solubility behavior of all the polymers are shown in Table 1. 
The hydrazide polymers exhibited good solubility in a variety of 
solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF, DMSO and m-cresol. Thus, 
the excellent solubility makes these polymers as potential 
candidates for practical applications by spin-coating or ink-jet 
printing processes. The thermally cured 1,3,4-oxadiazole polymers 
showed a diamatically decreased solubility as compared with their 
hydrazide precursors. 
The X-ray diffraction studies of the polyhydrazides and 
poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s indicated that all the polymers were 
essentially amorphous. The amorphous nature can be attributed to 
the introduction of bulky, twisted, three-dimensional 
4-tert-butyltriphenylamine unit along the polymer backbone. 
 
3.4. Thermal properties 
  The thermal properties of polyhydrazides and 
poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s are summarized in Table 2. The 
glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of polyhydrazides and 
poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s were observed in the range of 175~247 and 
263~291 oC by DSC. All of the poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s exhibited a 
similar TGA pattern with no significant weight loss below 490 oC 
in air or nitrogen atmosphere. The 10 % weight-loss temperatures 
(Td10) of the poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s in nitrogen and air were 
recorded in the range of 489~520 oC and 477~523 oC, respectively. 
The amount of carbonized residue (char yield) of these polymers 
was more than 48 % at 800 oC in nitrogen. When compared with 
the analogous poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s II’and IV’, the tert-butyl 
substituted series had lower char yields of these polymers that can 
be ascribed to their aliphatic content. 
 
3.5. Optical properties 
The optical properties of the polyhydrazides and 
poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s were investigated by UV-Vis and 
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The results are summarized 
in Table 3. These spolymers exhibited maximum UV-Vis 
absorption bands at 348~392 nm in NMP solution, assignable to 
the π-π* transition in the conjugated triphenylamine unit. Figure 2 
shows UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 
polyhydrazides and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s in NMP solutions (10-5 
mol/L). The 4-tert-butyltriphenylamine-containing polyhydrazides 
I-IPH, III-ABH and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) III-IPH, IV-ABH 
exhibited sky blue fluorescence emission maximum between 
447~474 nm in NMP solution with quantum yield of 39, 54 % and 
30, 38 %, respectively. Compared with III’-ABH and IV’-ABH, 
the higher fluorescence quantum yield of III-ABH and IV-ABH 
could be attributed to the incorporation of bulky tert-butyl group 
which may increase the mobility hindrance of the polymer chain. 
The photoluminescence of poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s in solution 
under UV irradiation are shown in Figure 3. 
 
3.6. Electrochemical and electrochromic properties 
  The redox behavior of all polymers were investigated by cyclic 
voltammetry conducted for the cast films on an ITO-coated glass 
substrate as working electrode in dry acetonitrile (CH3CN) 
containing 0.1 M of TBAP as an electrolyte under nitrogen 
atmosphere. The poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s II and IV series undergo 
one oxidation processes at E1/2 = 1.20~1.25 V. Typical cyclic 
voltammograms of polyoxadiazoles II-TPH and II’-TPH are 
illustrated in Figure 4. The energy of the HOMO and LUMO levels 
of the polymers can be determined from half-wave oxidation 
potentials (E1/2) and the onset absorption wavelength of the UV-Vis 
irradiation, and the results are listed in Table 3. For example, the 
E1/2 for polyhydrazide I-IPH has been determined as 1.28 V vs 
Ag/AgCl. The external ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox 
standard E1/2 is 0.44 V vs Ag/AgCl in CH3CN. Assuming that the 
HOMO energy for the Fc/Fc+ standard is 4.80 eV with respect to 
the zero vacuum level, the HOMO energy for 
poly(amine-hydrazide) I-IPH has been evaluated to be 5.64 eV. 
Electrochromism of the thin films from polymers were examined 
by casting of a polymer solution onto an ITO-coated glass substrate, 
and the electrochromic phenomenon occurred by different applied 
potentials. The polyhydrazides exhibited a pale yellow neutral state 
and a green radical cation state. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The new triphenylamine-containing aromatic dicarboxylic acid, 
4-tert-butyl-4’,4”-dicarboxytriphenylamine (2) was successfully 
synthesized in high purity and good yields. Novel aromatic 
polyhydrazides were prepared from the dicarboxylic acid with TPH, 
IPH and p-ABH, respectively, via the Yamazaki phosphorylation 
reaction, and they were thermally cyclodehydrated into the 
corresponding poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s. The polyhydrazide 
I-IPH and poly(amide-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s III-IPH exhibited sky 
blue fluorescence emission maximum at 456 and 447 nm in NMP 
solution with high quantum yield of 39% and 54% due to the high 
electron-donating and electron-accepting system. All obtained 
polyhydrazides revealed moderate stability of electrochromic 
characteristics, changing color from the colorless neutral form to 
the pale green oxidized forms when scanning potentials positively 
from 0.00 to 1.50 V. Thus, these polymers may find applications as 
new blue-emitting, hole-transporting and electrochromic materials 
due to their proper HOMO values, excellent thermal stability, good 
processability, high quantum efficiency and stable redox behavior.

A new 3,6-di(tert-butyl)-blocked carbazole and triphenylamine-containing aromatic diamine monomer, 4,4’-diamino-4’’-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-N-
carbazolyl)triphenylamine (5), was synthesized. It led to a series of novel poly(amine-imide)s 8a–8f by thermal and chemical imidization routes when reacted 
with six commercially available tetracarboxylic dianhydrides. These polymers were amorphous and most of them could afford flexible, transparent, and tough 
films. They had useful levels of thermal stability associated with high glass-transition temperatures (320–346oC), 10% weight-loss temperatures in excess of 
541℃ in nitrogen, and char yields at 800℃ in nitrogen higher than 60%. The photoluminescence spectra of the polymers in NMP exhibited an emission peak at 
387-403 nm. Cyclic voltammograms of the poly(amine-imide) films on an indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate exhibited two reversible redox couples 
at around 1.02 and 1.30 V versus Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile solution. The polymer films revealed excellent stability of electrochromic characteristics. They are pale 
yellow in the neutral state, green as a radical cation, and deep blue when fully oxidized.
ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION
The field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has attracted considerable interest ever since the 
seminal study on organic electrolumininscent (EL) devices by Tang and VanSlyke.1 Fabrication of an EL 
device with high performance, long durability, and low driving voltage can be effectively achieved with a 
multilayer sandwiched structure. To balance the injection and transport of both holes and electrons, hole-
and electron-transporting layers are often used. Triarylamine and carbazole derivatives have been used as 
hole transport materials for use in multilayer organic EL devices due to their relatively high mobilities and 
their low ionization potentials.2 The feasibility of utilizing spin-coating and ink-jet printing processes for 
large-area EL devices and possibilities of various chemical modifications (to improve emission efficiencies 
and allow patterning) make polymeric materials containing triarylamine units very attractive.3
Aromatic polyimides are well accepted as advanced materials for thin-film applications in 
microelectronic devices and liquid crystal displays due to their outstanding mechanical, chemical, thermal, 
and physical properties.4 However, the technological applications of most polyimides are limited by 
processing difficulties because of high melting or glass transition temperatures and limited solubility in 
most organic solvents due to their rigid backbones. To overcome these limitations, polymer-structure 
modification becomes necessary. One of the common approaches for increasing solubility and 
processability of polyimides without sacrificing high thermal stability is the introduction of bulky, packing-
disruptive groups into the polymer backbone.5 For example, the incorporation of three-dimensional, 
propeller-shaped triphenylamine unit into the polyimide backbone led to an enhanced solubility.6
Furthermore, triphenylamine-based polymers are widely used as the hole-transport layer in EL devices, but 
they also show interesting electrochromic behavior.7
We recently reported on the poly(amine-imide)s bearing main-chain triphenylamine and pendent 
carbazole units from the diamine monomer 4,4’-diamino-4”-N-carbazolyl- triphenylamine.8 The 
poly(amine-imide)s could afford amorphous and high-Tg films with useful mechanical properties (e.g.
flexibility). They also reveal good redox stability for the first oxidation state, and the oxidation process is 
always associated with a noticeable change of the coloration. However, the second oxidation process of 
these polymers is not reversible, possibly due to the electrochemical coupling of carbazoles through the 
active C3 and C6 sites. In this study, a molecular-design strategy to retain the useful properties of such 
polymers while enhancing the redox stability by substitution of the C3 and C6 positions of the carbazole
unit with bulky tert-butyl groups is reported. Thus, a novel carbazole-derived, triphenylamine-containing 
diamine monomer 5 was synthesized and was polycondensed with various aromatic dianhydrides to a series 
of novel poly(amine-imide)s. The tert-butyl groups are expected to increase the solubility and to give extra 
electrochemical stability of the resulting polymers.

was converted to poly(amine-imide) 8d by successive heating 
under vacuum at 150 ℃ for 30 min, 200 ℃ for 30 min, and then 
250 ℃ for 1 h. 
For the chemical imidization method, 4 mL acetic anhydride 
and 2 mL pyridine were added to the poly(amic acid) solution 
obtained by a similar process as above, and the mixture was 
heated at 100 ℃ for 1 h to effect a complete imidization. The 
resulting reddish precipitate was washed thoroughly with 
methanol and water, collected by filtration, and dried at 150  ℃
for 4 h. The inherent viscosity of poly(amine-imide) 8d was 0.41 
dL/g, measured in DMAc at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL at 30 .℃  
The IR spectrum of 8d (film) exhibited characteristic imide

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Polymer Synthesis 
A series of novel poly(amine-imide)s 8a–8f bearing pendent 
3,6-di-tert-butyl-carbazole units were prepared by the reaction of 
diamine 5 with six commercially available dianhydrides 6a–6f in 
DMAc at room temperature to form the precursor poly(amic 
acid)s, followed by chemical or thermal imidization (Scheme 2). 
The inherent viscosities of the poly(amic acid) precursors were in 
the range 0.50-0.68 dL/g (Table 1). The thermal conversion to 
polyimides was carried out by successive heating of the poly(amic 
acid) films to 250 ℃. Most of the thermally imidized 
poly(amine-imide) films cracked on fingernail creasing, probably

typical cyclic voltammograms of poly(amine-imide)s 8f and 8’f 
recorded at scanning rate of 100 mV/s. It can be seen that 
polymer 8f exhibited better redox stability as compared to 8’f. A 
reversible oxidation process of 8f is observed. In contrast, 
without blocking the electrochemically active sites (C3 and C6 
of the carbazole units), the oxidation process of 8’f is not 
reversible. These results indicate that the introduction of 
tert-butyl substituents imparts enhanced electrochemical 
stability as they block the electrochemically active sites (C3 and 
C6) of the carbazole units. As depicted in Fig. 4, two redox 
processes were observed for polymer 8f, indicative of the radical 
and dication states. The first electron removal for 
poly(amine-imide) 8f is assumed to occur at the nitrogen atom 
on the main chain triphenylamine unit, which is more 
electron-rich than the nitrogen atom on the pendent carbazolyl 
moiety. For all the 8 series polymers, a change of coloration is 
associated with the oxidation process. Three color states are 
observed: pale yellow to green to deep blue. 
The energy of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the 
investigated poly(amine imide)s can be determined from the 
oxidation half-wave potentials and the onset absorption 
wavelength, and the results are listed in Table 3. For example, 
the oxidation half-wave potential for poly(amine-imide) 8f has 
been determined as 1.01 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The external 
ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox standard E1/2 is 0.44 V vs 
Ag/AgCl in CH3CN. The HOMO energy for the Fc/Fc+ standard 
is 4.80 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level. Therefore, the 
HOMO energy for polymer 8f has been evaluated to be 5.37 eV. 
With use of the same method, the HOMO positions of other 
poly(amine imide)s were determined to be in the range of 
5.37-5.41 eV.

2.2 Synthesis of Polyamides   
A 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer 
was charged with 0.5857 g (1.50 mmol) of diamine momomer 4, 
0.2492 g (1.50 mmol) of terephthalic acid (5a), 1.5 mL of TPP, 2 
mL of NMP, 0.5 mL of pyridine, and 0.2 g of calcium chloride 
(CaCl2) . The reaction mixture was heated with stirring at 110 ℃ 
for 3 h. The resulting polymer solution was poured slowly into 200 
mL of stirring methanol giving rise to a stringy, fiber-like 
precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with 
hot water and methanol, and dried. The other poly(amine amide)s 
were prepared by an analogous procedure. 
 
 
2.3 Synthesis of Polyimides  
The diamine monomer 4 (0.6641 g, 1.707 mmol) was 
dissolved in 9.5 mL of DMAc in a 50-mL round-bottom flask. 
Then 10e, ODPA (0.6023 g, 1.356 mmol) was added to the diamine 
solution in one portion. The mixture was stirred at room 
temperature for about 3 h to yield a viscous poly(amic acid) 
solution. The poly(amic acid) film was obtained by casting from 
the reaction polymer solution onto a glass Petri-dish and drying at 
90℃ overnight. The poly(amic acid) in the form of solid film was 
converted to polyimide 10f  by successive heating under vacuum 
at 150 ℃ for 30 min, 200 ℃ for 30 min, and then 250 ℃ for 1 
h. 
 
 
3. Result and Disussion 
3.1 Polymer Synthesis  
According to the phosphorylation technique described by 
Yamazaki and co-workers,25 a series of novel triphenylamine-based 
aromatic poly(amine-amide)s, 6a-h, with indole molecular  
para-substituted on thependent phenyl ring were prepared from the 
diamine 4 and various aromatic dicarboxylic diacids (5a-h) by the 
direct polycondensation reaction with triphenyl phosphate (TPP) 
and pyridine as condensing agents (Scheme 2). Poly(amine-imide)s 
11a-11f were prepared in conventional two-step method by the 
reactions of equal molar amounts of diamine 4 with various 
aromatic dianhydrides (11a to 11f) to form poly(amic acid)s, 
followed by thermal or chemical cyclodehydration (Scheme 3).

3.2 Properties of Polyamides  
All the polyamides were readily soluble in amide-type polar 
aprotic solvents (such as NMP, DMAc, and DMF). The high 
solubility of these polyamides is apparently due in part to the 
presence of the packing-disruptive triphenylamine unit in the 
polymer backbone, which resulted in increased chain packing 
distances and decreased intermolecular interactions. One of the 
factors contributing to the enhanced solubility was the 
characteristic amorphous nature caused by the introduction of 
bulky triphenylamine core. Polyamides could afford flexible and 
thouh films, and they were amorphous in nature as evidenced by 
wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns. Thermal properties of all 
polymers were evaluated by DSC, TMA and TGA. The thermal 
behavior data of the poly(amine-amide)s are summarized in Table 1. 
Tg of these poly(amine-amide)s was obtained from the middlepoint 
temperature of baseline shift on the second DSC heating trace 
(heating rate = 20 ℃ /min) after rapid cooling from 400 ℃ 
(cooling rate = 200 ℃/min). Poly(amine-amide)s of 6a-6h showed 
the clear Tg in the range of 246～324 ℃ and The Ts values of 
these polymer film samples were also measured with TMA by the 
penetration method. The Ts values of these poly(amine-amide) 
were observed in the range 276~302 ℃. All of the polymers 
exhibited good thermal stability; the Td of polyamides 6a-6h at a 
10% weight loss temperatures were in the range of 484-544 ℃ in 
nitrogen and 529-600 ℃  in air, respectively. The optical and 
electrochemical properties of the poly(amine-amide)s were 
investigated by CV, UV–vis, and PL spectroscopy. These polymers 
(6a~6h) exhibited strong UV–vis absorption bands at 300~347 nm 
in NMP solutions, which were assignable to the π - π *  
transition resulting from the conjugation between the aromatic 
rings and nitrogen atoms. In the solid state, the UV-vis absorption 
of indole-based poly(amine-amide)s 6a-6h were showed 
absorbance at 367-481 nm. The PL spectra in NMP solution 
showed maximum bands around 383-462 in the violet-to-blue 
region. The electrochemical properties of the poly(amine-amide)s 
6a-6h were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique 
conducted for a cast film on an ITO-coated glass substrate as 
working electrode in dry acetonitrile (CH3CN) containing 0.1 M of 
TBAP as supporting electrolyte and saturated Ag/AgCl as reference 
electrode under nitrogen atmosphere. Fig 2 shows the typical cyclic

4. Concusions  
A new TPA-containing aromatic diamine (4) was successfully 
synthesized in high purity and good yield. Two series of new poly 
(amine-amide)s 6a-6h and poly (amine-imide)s 11a-11f have been 
prepared form a newly synthesizes aromatic diamine monomer, 
4-(N-indolyl)-4’,4”-diaminotriphenylamine (4) with various 
aromatic dicarboxylic acids and dianhydrides, respectively. All the 
polymers were amorphous with good solubility in many polar 
aprotic solvents and exhibited excellent thin-film-forming ability. 
In addition to high Tg and Ts values, high thermal stability and 
good mechanical properties.

Introduction
Electrochromism is known as the reversible change in
optical absorption or transmittance upon redox
switching.1 This interesting property led to the
development of many technological applications such
as automatic anti-glazing mirror, smart windows,
electrochromic displays, and chameleon materials.2
Many different classes of electrochromic materials,
such as organic systems, e.g., bipyridium salt (also
known as viologens),3 electroactive conducting
polymers (e.g., polyanilines,4 polythiophenes,5
polypyrroles6), as well as inorganic systems based on
transition metal oxides (e.g., WO3
7) have been
described. Conducting or conjugated polymers have
been found to be more promising as electrochromic
materials because of their better stability, faster
switching speeds, and easy processing compared to the
inorganic electrochromic materials, but the most
exciting properties are the display of multiple colors
with the same material while switching between their
different redox states,8 and fine-tuning of the color
transition through chemical structure modification of
the conjugated backbone.9,10 Considerable effort in the
Reynolds group has been made on the understanding
and the tailoring of electrochromic properties in
conducting polymers such as
poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene)s5 and
poly(3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole)s6 and their derivatives.
Triarylamine derivatives are well known for photo-
and electroactive properties that find optoelectronic
applications as photoconductors, hole-transporters, and
light-emitters.11 Triarylamines can be easily oxidized to
form stable radical cations, and the oxidation process is
always associated with a noticeable change of
coloration. Thus, many triarylamine-based
electrochromic polymers have been reported in
literature.12 In recent years, we have developed a
number of high-performance polymers (e.g., aromatic
polyamides and polyimides) carrying the
triphenylamine (TPA) unit as an electrochromic
functional moiety.13 Our strategy was to synthesize the
TPA-containing monomers such as diamines and
dicarboxylic acids that were then reacted with the
corresponding comonomers through conventional
polycondensation techniques. The obtained polymers
possessed characteristically high molecular weights
and high thermal stability. Because of the incorporation
of packing-disruptive, propeller-shaped TPA units
along the polymer backbone, most of these polymers
exhibited good solubility in polar organic solvents.
They may form uniform, transparent amorphous thin
films by solution casting and spin-coating methods.
This is advantageous for their ready fabrication of
large-area, thin-film devices.
In order to be useful for applications, electrochromic
materials must exhibit long-term stability, rapid redox
switching, and large changes in transmittance (large
Δ%T) between their bleached and colored states.14 As
an electrochromic functional moiety, the TPA unit has
two basic properties: (1) the easy oxidizability of the
nitrogen center and (2) its hole-transporting ability via
the radical cation species. However, unsubstituted TPA
undergoes coupling-deprotonation to form
tetraphenyl-benzidine after the formation of the initial
monocation radical.15 The oxidation potential and the
π-π* bandgap of the product, generaly caled 
triaryldiamine, are different from that of the starting
material. Therefore, the small concentration of the
product may cause an unstable color change of the
electrochromic material during redox switching. The
formation of protons as by-products may deteriorate
the coloration efficiency of the electrochromic devices
through undesirable side reactions. It has been well
established that incorporation of electron-donating
substituents such as methoxy group at the para position
of TPA prevents the coupling reactions and affords
stable radical cations.15,16 It has also been demonstrated
that carbazole derivatives with dimethylamino (NMe2)
groups para to the carbazole nitrogen could afford quite
stable radical cations in the first one-electron oxidation
process and reasonably stable dication quinonediimines
could also be generated by a second one-electron
process.17 Therefore, we synthesized the diamine
monomer,
4,4’-diamino-4”-(dimethylamino)triphenyl-amine
[(NMe2)TPA-diamine; 2], and its derived aromatic
polyamides containing electroactive TPA units with
electron-donating NMe2 para substituted on the
pendent phenyl ring. The NMe2 substituents are
expected to reduce the oxidation potential and increase
the electrochemical stability and electric conductivity
of the polyamides. We anticipated that the
electrochromic films prepared from the present
polyamides would be very stable to multiple redox
switching and exhibit enhanced optical response times.
For a comparative study, some properties of the present
polyamides will be compared with those of structurally
related ones based on
4,4’-diamino-4”-(diphenylamino)triphenylamine
[(NPh2)TPA-diamine; 2’] that has been reported
previously.13b

According to the phosphorylation technique first
described by Yamazaki and coworkers,19 a series of
novel polyamides 4a~4d with main-chain (NMe2)TPA
units were synthesized from the diamine monomer 2
with four aromatic dicarboxylic acids 3a~3d (Scheme
2). The polymerization was carried out via solution
polycondensation using triphenyl phosphite and
pyridine as condensing agents. All polymerization
reactions proceeded smoothly and gave high molecular
weights. The obtained polyamides had inherent
viscosities in the range of 0.77~1.64 dL/g, as shown in
Table 1. All the polymers could afford transparent and
tough films via solution casting, indicating high
molecular weights. The structures of the polyamides
could be confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Two
structurally related polyamides 4b’and 4c’derived
from (NPh2)TPA-diamne 2’are used for comparison
studies.

d The solubility was determined with a 1 mg sample
in 1 mL of a solvent. ++, soluble at room temperature;
+, soluble on heating; +-, partially soluble or swelling;

Physical Properties
The solubility properties of polymers 4a-d were
investigated qualitatively, and the results are also listed
in Table 1. All the polyamides were readily soluble in
polar aprotic organic solvents such as NMP, DMAc,
DMF, and DMSO. Thus, the excellent solubility makes
these polymers potential candidates for practical
applications by spin-coating or inkjet-printing
processes to afford high performance thin films for
optoelectronic devices. As mentioned earlier, the
polyamides 4a-4d could be solvent cast into flexible,
transparent, and tough films. As shown in Table 1, the
cast films are transparent gray (for 4b), light yellowish
green (for 4a and 4d) and pale brown (for 4c) in color.
The WAXD studies of these film samples indicated that
all the polymers were essentially amorphous. Their
high solubility and amorphous properties can be
attributed to the incorporation of bulky,
three-dimensional (NMe2)TPA moiety along the
polymer backbone, which results in a high steric
hindrance for close packing, and thus reduces their
crystallization tendency.
Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of polyamides were examined
by TGA and DSC, and the thermal behavior data are
summarized in Table 2. Even with the introduction of
NMe2 groups, all prepared polyamides exhibited good
thermal stability with insignificant weight loss up to
450 oC under nitrogen or air atmosphere. The 10 %
weight loss temperatures of these polymers in nitrogen
and air were recorded in the range of 514–566 and
527–576 oC, respectively. The concentration of
carbonized residue (char yield) of these polymers in a
nitrogen atmosphere was more than 67 % at 800 oC.
The high char yields of these polymers can be ascribed
to their high aromatic content. The glass-transition
temperatures (Tg) of polyamides 4a-4d could be easily
measured in the DSC thermograms; they were
observed in the range of 277–298 oC, depending upon
the stiffness of the polymer chain. The lowest Tg value
of 4b in this series polymers can be explained in terms
of the flexible ether linkage in its diacid component.
All the polymers indicated no clear melting
endotherms up to the decomposition temperatures on
the DSC thermograms. This result supports the
amorphous nature of these polyamides. As can be seen
from Table 2, polyamides 4b and 4c revealed a slightly
higher Tg as compared to their respective analogs 4b’
and 4c’. This result implies that the bulky NPh2
substituent in the 4’series polyamides leads to an
increase in steric hindrance for close chain packing, as
well as an enhanced fractional free volume between
polymer chains.

nm and a broad band having its maximum absorption
wavelength at 805 nm gradually increased in intensity.
We attribute this spectral change to the formation of a
stable monocation radical of the (NMe2)TPA moiety.
As the applied potential became more anodic to 1.2 V,
the absorption bands of the cation radical decreased
gradually in intensity, with the formation of a new
broad band centered at around 640 nm. This spectral
change can be attributable to the formation of a
dication in the (NMe2)TPA segment of the polyamide.
The observed UV-vis absorption changes in the film of
4b at various potentials are fully reversible and are
associated with strong color changes; indeed, they even
can be seen readily by the naked eye. From the inset
shown in Figure 3, it can be seen that the film of 4b
switches from a transmissive neutral state (colorless) to
a highly absorbing semi-oxidized state (green) and a
fully oxidized state (deep blue). The film colorations
are distributed homogeneously across the polymer film
and survive for more than hundreds of redox cycles.
The polymer 4b shows good contrast in the visible
region, with an extremely high optical transmittance
change (Δ%T) of 88 % at λmax = 640 nm, comparable
to that obtained in conducting
poly(3,4-dialkylenedioxythiophene) derivatives.14 The
coloration efficiency at 640 nm is as high as ca. 261
cm2/C with a high optical density change (δOD) up to
0.94, determined from the in situ experiments.

Figure 4. 3-D spectroelectrochemical behavior of the
4b thin film on the ITO-coated glass substrate (in
CH3CN with 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte
from 0 to 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
For optical switching studies, polymer films were cast on
ITO-coated glass slides in the same manner as described above, and
each film was potential stepped between its neutral (0 V) and
oxidized (+0.55 V) state. While the films were switched, the
absorbance at 805 nm was monitored as a function of time with
UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy. Switching data for the cast film of
polyamide 4b are given in Figure 5. The switching time was
calculated at 90% of the full switch because it is difficult to perceive
any further color change with naked eye beyond this point. The
polyamides switch rapidly (within two seconds) between the highly
transmissive neutral state and the colored oxidized state. Thin film of
polyamide 4b required only 1.65 s at 0.55 V for coloring and 0.93 s
for bleaching, reflecting the different reaction rates between the
neutral and oxidized forms of the film of 4b. As shown in Figure 6,
the absorbance changes at 805 nm reflect the switch in current, and
the kinetics of the charge transport process can be referenced to the
coloration response time. The electrochromic coloration efficiencies
(η＝δOD805/Q) after various switching steps of the film of
polyamide 4b are summarized in Table 4. The electrochromic film of
4b was found to exhibit high coloration efficiencies up to 242 cm2/C
at 805 nm, and to retain near 80% of its optical response after 500
coloring/bleaching cycles. Therefore, the electrochromic switching
behavior appears to be a highly reversible process.
