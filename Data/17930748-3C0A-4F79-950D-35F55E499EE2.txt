11. Introduction
High peak power and short pulsewidth fiber lasers are of interested in laser science and
technologies because they have many practical applications in various domains. The operation of
short-pulse lasers can be divided into three major types: Q-switching, continuous-wave
mode-locking (CML), and Q-switched mode-locking (QML). Various active or passive technologies
have been utilized in the construction of short-pulse fiber lasers [1]. All active pulsed lasers contain
bulk elements, which make their design rather complicated; therefore, much attention has been paid
to the development of passive fiber lasers [2-4]. Passive mode-locking technologies are widely
reported in the generation of ultrashort pulses using several different methods such as saturable
absorbers (SAs), semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs), Kerr-lens mode-locking
(KLM), nonlinear mirror (NLM), and nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE). Among these
technologies, the saturable absorption of graphene is potentially attractive to be used in the
ultra-broadband passive mode-lockers for rare-earth-doped fiber lasers [5].
Graphene is a novel two-dimensional nanomaterial with honeycomb lattice formed by carbon
atoms [6]. In 2004, single-layer graphene was first successfully produced in the laboratory [7].
There are several methods to prepare the graphene, among which is the process of graphite oxide
exfoliation with graphene oxide reduction. For photon energies above 0.5 eV, graphene yields a
spectrally flat optical absorbance of (2.3 0.2) % [8], and the absorption coefficient of graphene
decreases over a broad spectral range when the optical intensity is increased [9]. Chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) of graphene using copper as the substrate is one of the most promising methods
for producing high quality graphene over large areas [10]. The mechanism is surface related due to
the peculiar interactions between Cu and C and therefore limited to a single layer of graphene.
Recently, a new kind of CVD method for graphene growth is demonstrated by Chan [11]. Using oil
backstreaming from the oil seal rotary vane pump as the carbon source, different numbers of
graphene layers are grown on copper foil without hydrogen and hydrocarbon gas flow as in the
conventional CVD method. After growth, the graphene film can be transferred onto insulating
substrates, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). This new method allows multi-layer
graphene to grow on the copper foil, thus overcoming the situation of monolayer graphene
formation as in the conventional CVD method.
Broadband light sources play important roles in optical communication technologies and
biophotonic applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have been used as the gain
media in fiber lasers [12-14]. As compared to the rare-earth-doped fibers, SOAs have many
practical advantages such as compact in size, higher optical nonlinearity, and larger gain bandwidth.
In addition, the upper-state lifetime of SOAs (scaling from nanoseconds to picoseconds) are much
shorter than those of rare-earth-doped fibers (microseconds). As a result, the energy stored in the
upper state and the gains of SOAs are typically smaller than those of the doped fibers, but the
responses of SOAs are much faster. Recently, several researchers have reported wavelength-tunable
or multi-wavelength fiber lasers based on SOAs. Moreover, the broad emission bandwidth has made
SOAs as suitable gain media for ultrashort pulse lasers.

Figure 2 shows the experimental setup of ring-cavity fiber lasers with the insertion of
graphene/PMMA saturable absorbers. A fiber-pigtailed laser diode (LD) is used as the pump source,
which has a center wavelength of 974 nm. The pump light is coupled into the ring cavity via a
wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) coupler. The erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) consists
of 90-cm erbium-doped fiber (EDF), a multi-layer graphene/PMMA saturable absorber, an output
coupler, an optical isolator, and a WDM coupler [Fig. 2(a)]. The optical isolator is used in the cavity
to assure unidirectional operation of laser oscillation, and the 40% port of a 40/60 coupler is used as
the laser output. The total cavity length of EDFL is about 12 m. For ytterbium-doped fiber laser
(YDFL), the cavity consists of 90-cm ytterbium-doped fiber (YDF), a 30/70 output coupler with
30% output, two polarization controllers (PCs), an optical isolator, a multi-layer graphene/PMMA
saturable absorber, HI 1060 jumpers, and a WDM coupler [Fig. 2(b)]. The output from the passively
mode-locked fiber lasers are measured by a high-speed InGaAs photodetector, a digital oscilloscope,
a power meter, an autocorrelator, an optical spectrum analyzer, and a radio frequency (RF) spectrum
analyzer.
Figure 3 shows the experimental setup of the SOA-based fiber laser. In our experiment, we
have adopted two laser cavity configurations: a ring cavity [Fig. 3(a)] and a figure-eight cavity [Fig.
3(b)]. The ring-cavity laser is constructed by a 1.3-m SOA, SMF-28 jumpers, an optical isolator, a
50/50 output coupler, two polarization controllers, and a polarizer. The SOA has a peak output
wavelength of 1290 nm and FWHM bandwidth of 54 nm. The maximum small signal gain is 20.9
dB and the saturation output power is 10.8 dBm. Since SOA is a bidirectional device, the optical
isolator is used in the cavity to maintain unidirectional laser oscillation. For the figure-eight laser,
two sub-cavities are connected by a 50/50 coupler. The left sub-cavity is formed by a polarization
controller, an SMF jumper, an isolator, and a 10/90 coupler with 10% output. The right sub-cavity
consists of an SOA, an SMF jumper, and a polarization controller. All fiber components in the
5pump current of 110 mA. The pulse repetition rate is 16.126 MHz, corresponding to cavity
round-trip time of 62 ns. By assuming sech2 pulse shape for the autocorrelation trace, the pulse
duration is calculated to be 627 fs. The mode-locked EDFL has peak wavelength of 1563.0 nm and
bandwidth of 4.5 nm (full width at half maximum, FWHM). The time-bandwidth product of the
mode-locked pulses is 0.347. Since we do not incorporate dispersion compensation components in
the cavity, the total intracavity dispersion is anomalous. As shown in the RF spectrum [Fig. 4(d)] of
the graphene mode-locked EDFL, 78.25 dB peak-to-background ratio around the fundamental
repetition rate is observed, indicating very good mode-locking stability.

The same graphene/PMMA sample is also used in the mode-locking of ytterbium-doped fiber
laser of Fig. 2(b). At low pump currents, the YDFL operates in the CW state. When the LD current
is increased to 100 mA, the YDFL turns into mode-locking with output power of 2.8 mW. The
intracavity polarization controllers are helpful in stabilizing the mode-locking state, and the HI 1060
jumpers are used to adjust the total cavity length. At LD pump current of 200 mA, the output power
of mode-locked YDFL becomes 12.2 mW. Figure 5(a)-(d) show the output powers, pulse train,
optical spectrum, and RF spectrum of the graphene mode-locked YDFL at LD pump current of 200
mA. The pulse repetition rate is 7.28 MHz and the pulse duration is measured to be 270 ps. The

Fig. 6. Various output waveforms generated in the elongated ring-cavity fiber laser [(a), (c),
(e), (g), (i)] and their optical spectra [(b), (d), (f), (h), (j)].
For figure-eight SOA-based fiber laser of Fig. 3(b), stable mode-locking pulses with various
repetition rates can be generated by proper polarization adjustment. The minimum pulse repetition
rate observed is 4.33 MHz, which is the fundamental repetition rate of this cavity. At this
fundamental mode-locking frequency, the laser output pulses are staircase-shaped and the spectrum
shows again the dual-band structure similar to those of the ring-cavity SOA-based fiber laser. In
comparison to the ring-cavity laser, the pulse repetition rate of figure-eight laser can be increased to
9pulse duration of the graphene mode-locked EDFL are 16.126 MHz, 4.5 nm, and 627 fs,
respectively. We have obtained peak-to-background ratio of 78.25 dB in the RF spectrum around the
fundamental repetition rate, which indicates very good mode-locking stability. The same
graphene/PMMA sample can also be used in YDFL, and the threshold pump current for
mode-locking is 100 mA. At LD pump current of 200 mA, the repetition rate, spectral width, and
pulse duration of the graphene mode-locked YDFL are 7.28 MHz, 1.15 nm, and 270 ps, respectively.
The bandwidth of graphene mode-locked YDFL is only 1.15 nm, which is much less than the results
using NPE technologies. This problem still needs further studies in the future.
For SOA-based fiber lasers, various optical waveforms such as staircase, rectangular, and
sinusoidal pulses are generated with ring-cavity configuration. Maximum pulse repetition rate of
926 MHz is observed in the laser with “overshooting”rectangular pulses. The overshooting could
be attributed to the fast relaxation oscillation occurring in the SOA gain medium. For figure-eight
SOA-based fiber laser, stable mode-locked pulses can be generated by tuning the polarization
controllers, with repetition rate ranging from the fundamental mode-locking frequency of 4.33 MHz
to the 1411th harmonic mode-locking frequency of 6.11 GHz. Intracavity powers of only several
milliwatts is enough to achieve multi-gigahertz repetition rates. The pulse repetition rate of this
figure-eight fiber laser can be potentially increased to several tens of gigahertz if an SOA of larger
saturation output power is used as the gain medium. Since the laser pulses are not transform-limited,
they can be compressed to femtosecond duration using proper dispersion compensation technology,
thus providing economic test sources for laser science, biophotonics, and optical communication.
