摘要 
網路化在工業上的應用越來越普及，由於網路化可以帶來需許多優點，比如減少配
線、減少安裝及維護的成本，所以由網路連結與多系統的溝通也成為了一種趨勢。在建
構網路化控制方面，本研究運用 RS-232 串接的形式將多軸馬達連接構成一個網路化的
系統，藉由 DSP F2812 與馬達之間的通訊協定成功的來控制四軸馬達。使平台分別測試
於低速(30 cm/s)與高速(100 cm/s)，於平台位置迴路上加上 PID 控制器，改善實際位置誤
差。由於網路式的控制受限於傳輸率的限制，所需的取樣周期較大，因此我們將針對於
不同的取樣時間下，探討網路式與與集中式的效果。近來全方位攝影機在機器人導航領
域中被拿來做為目標物追蹤以及機器人定位，本文以 Kalman filter 針對影像目標物相對
位置作估測，以消除平台行走間產生震盪問題，本論文提出以感測融合的方式，結合影
像與 encoder，提升平台相對定位的精確度及穩定性。本論文整合遠端控制、影像傳輸
與平台運動控制三方面，遠端遙控者可以藉由網路傳輸下達命令給平台，平台上影像也
可藉由網路傳輸回傳至遙控者。最後，整體平台藉由網路化的結構，並具由遠端遙控及

Abstract 
Recently, network control system (NCS) becomes popular in different industrial 
applications with advantages as low cost, reduction of installation, and easy maintenance. The 
servo motor adopted in this study with the serious RS-232 interface to connect all motors as 
the NCS. The DSP F2812 is applied to generate commands as the protocol to control four 
motors of an omni-directional mobile robot (ODMR). The mobile robot was tested with both 
at a low speed (30 cm/s) and a high speed (100 cm/s) with acceleration and deceleration. By 
adding the PID position controller, the robot motion accuracy is significantly improved in a 
centralized control structure which is usually faster compared with the NCS structure. A 
suitable sampling time for the NCS on the ODMR is determined in real application 
experimentally by considering the sampling time and the system performance. 
    The omni-directional camera can be applied as the function of tracking and localization 
on the robot navigation. Its estimation of relative position between an object and a robot is 
improved by applying the Kalman filter to reduce the oscillation as robot starts to move.

3. 網路式與集中式之實驗結果 
1、開迴路控制 
    整體平台於未加入控制器時，位置誤差由 encoder 所觀察到的誤差於不同的取樣時
間，如表一，在各種不同取樣時間下整體平台誤差由馬達回授可以得到若未加入平台控
制器，則集中式產生了較大的誤差。由於各軸不匹配的情況下，則平台隨著取樣時間越
大而位置誤差也越明顯；而 NCS 則由於各軸直接接受 RS-232 命令，所以於整體路徑的
行走上會有較小的誤差值。

    整體平台未加入控制器時，由 encoder 所觀察到的 NCS 誤差低速時小於 1 cm，高
速時小於 2 cm，集中式的誤差則皆大於 4 cm 以上，必須加入平台控位置制器來改善整
體平台的位置誤差，因此於不同取樣時間下調整平台控制器的參數，加入位置控制器改
善後，平台 encoder 所得到的誤差接近於零。提升了平台的位置控制精確性。

Type 2：image only 
    使用影像所得到的位置、角度回授，影像經由 Kalman Filter 位置估測後，減少影像
的震盪，由全方位鏡上所得到的平台座標 X、Y、φ最為回授，圖九為使用 image 回授
所得到的平台三方向軌跡，可以看出若平台距離偵測物較遠時，則容易震盪，導致平台
一開始所偵測到的角度稍為傾斜，因此整體由影像所得到的回授有達到且差了 1.5cm，
與 Type 1 比較起來，整體平台實際精確度大為提升，因此為了消除平台一開始行走的震
盪現象，提出 Type 3 的融合方法。 
 
圖 九、 Type 2 直線路徑圖( ageImμ =1) 
 
Type 3：感測融合(fusion) 
    將影像與 encoder 所得到的值做融合機制如圖 4-3 所示，當距離目標物較遠時，則
使用 encoder 為依據，較近時則以影像為主，由此來達到平台的 encoder 穩定與 image
精確的控制，為了防止突然切換 encoder 與 image 的強烈震盪，加入了權重的切換，如
圖十所示的融合機制，使得回授訊號較為平穩，不會導致平台不受控。NCS 加入融合的
方法後，整體實際誤差由 9.7cm 降至 1.03cm，改善率為 89.4%。

5. 結論 
1、建立平台網路化控制 
   運用 RS-232 的通訊協定，實現於於全方位移動平台多軸運動控制架構。低速運動，
兩者有相當的表現，高速時，需較快的取樣週期，所以使用集中式有較好的效果。      
2、感測融合 
   由於 encoder 與 image 存在各自的優缺點，因此以距離感測融合的機制，使得平台移
動穩定性及準確性提升，於網路式與集中式的控制下，改善平台位置誤差 90%。 
3、實現目標物追蹤與遠端控制平台 
   全方位移動平台自主追蹤目標物，並以穩定又快速的移動能力。平台亦可藉由網路
來遙控平台，並可將平台影像傳回操作者端觀賞，實現整體平台網路化控制。 
 
6. 成果自評

實現，對於網路監控系統之實現，兼具實務及學術價值，為一有意義之研究雛形成果。

parameters of traffic systems usually considered in the police’s mind are adopted in the present study as follows [7]: 
1) CarsBehindRed,  
2) CarsBehindGreen, and  
3) Cycle Starting Time.  
The parameter CarsBehindRed means the average length of vehicles waiting behind the red light. The larger the 
CarsBehindRed indicates that the more serious congestion behind the red lights is, so the light is highly recommended 
to switch to green, as soon as possible. The parameter CarsBehindGreen means the average length of vehicles waiting 
behind the green light. The larger the CarsBehindGreen also indicates that the more serious congestion even behind the 
green lights is, so the current green light has to maintain for extra seconds. The third parameter Cycle Starting Time 
means the time duration since the light changes from red to green. In physical meaning, the longer the Cycle Starting 
Time is, the higher probability to change the signal from green to red should be. Thus, the above three parameters are 
the input of the present fuzzy controller for the traffic flow control.  
Although the present parameter setting is quite simple, its fuzzy rules are still complex in real applications. Some 
neural fuzzy controllers [8, 9] were proposed to train the system in self-learning procedures to produce the fuzzy rule 
base. In this paper, by observing the decision of experienced polices, a fuzzy controller with four membership functions 
as shown in Figs. 1-4 is proposed. The average waiting length is in general shorter than 80 meters and the membership 
functions of the fuzzy control are divided into three subsets  as: small, medium and large, as shown in Figs. 1-2. 
Moreover, the slopes of membership functions are determined by the degree of vehicle accumulation. In the red light, 
the number of waiting vehicles accumulates quickly and therefore, a larger slope is determined in the intersection 
between small and medium to represent their quick changing rate. On the other hand, under the green light, all vehicles 
move forward continuously and quickly and the changing rate of the slope in the membership function should be 
relatively lower. As for the intersection between medium and large, the traffic jam may occur, no matter the light is red 
or green and therefore, the values of slopes should increase to reflect the traffic jam problem as soon as possible. 
Furthermore, the Cycle Starting Time is simply assigned as short and long to simplify the fuzzy rules and as shown in 
Figs. 3-4, only five discrete values of the change probability, which is basically from the priori judgment of polices’ 
decision, are given in this study to represent as No, Probably No, Maybe, Probably Yes, and Yes.

Fig. 2.  CarsBehindGreen 
 
z Rule 2: When the Cycle Starting Time is within 6-15 seconds, the vehicles have begun to move so a higher threshold 
for switching the light is set, from 0.6 to 0.63, to possibly extend the time for the green light to prevent the frequent 
change of green lights. 
 
z Rule 3: When the Cycle Starting Time has been lasted within 16-50 seconds, the threshold for switching light is 
chosen back to the normal value of 0.6. 
With the above arrangement, the proposed adaptive-fuzzy approach will allow more vehicles to pass the intersection 
during rush hours as well as in normal time, as seen in the later simulation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III. MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS IN TRAFFIC NETWORKS 
A. A Hierarchical Architecture for MAS Traffic Management 
 For the applications of multi-agent systems on the traffic network control, France and Ghorbani proposed a 
hierarchical multi-agent model for urban traffic control in 2003 [10], as shown in Fig. 5. In this paper, every 
independent intersection can be controlled by the local traffic agent (LTA) with the identical adaptive-fuzzy control 
algorithm. Since each LTA in a MAS system of a traffic network also involves in the control strategy of its neighboring 
intersections. Therefore, in order to maintain good communication and cooperation among the local traffic agents, a 
coordinator traffic agent (CTA) is thus required not only to coordinate the LTA but also to communicate with the 
global traffic agent, which monitors the whole traffic network, and accept special concerns of the GTA and guides the 
LTA. The LTAs will take charge of major calculation to share the burden of the whole traffic network control. When 
the network is large enough to be divided into several regions controlled by a single CTA, a global traffic agent (GTA) 
is thus be set to link the CTAs together and coordinate the messages among each CTAs. Under this condition, the 
algorithm of the LTA can be directly implemented as for the CTA and the algorithm of the CTA can be also directly 
implemented as for the GTA 
 
urban and highway applications for all complex traffic conditions which can be visualized in an unprecedented level for 
providing realistic traffic models. All advanced signal control logic can be implemented in VISSIM by the additional 
function of VisVAP which is a VAP programming language. In addition to the basic fixed-time mode of traffic light 
controller, the vehicle actuated method [12] is an efficient signal control logic defined as that during the initial interval 
elapses as the signal changes from red to green, the green signal is extended only by an extension unit time. Once a 
vehicle is detected during the extended time, the green signal is maintained until there is no vehicle detected during the 
last extended time, or the total length reaches its set value, say 50 seconds.  
According to the provided conditions of traffic flow, results of five control methods are discussed in this paper as: (1) 
the fixed-time mode, (2) the vehicle actuated method, (3) the fuzzy control method, (4) the adaptive-fuzzy control 
method, and (5) the AF agents. The performance index of each controller is the delay time and results of other control 
methods are compared with results of the fixed-time mode. 
A. A Single Intersection 
A single intersection is shown as Fig. 6 and the traffic flow rate on the E-W direction is assumed to change with time 
(per 600 seconds) which is called Peak (300Æ 500Æ 800Æ 1200Æ 700Æ 400 veh./hr) including the normal time and 
the rush hour of a day. The conditions of the traffic flow rates in simulation on S-N direction are Light (300 veh./hr), 
Heavy (1000 veh./hr), and the Peak, separately. The improvement of all the vehicle actuated method, the fuzzy control 
method, and the adaptive fuzzy control method are compared to the fixed-time mode as in TABLE II. 
 
 
 
Results as in TABLE II indicate that although the vehicle 
actuated method is more effective than the traditional fixed-time control, the present fuzzy only with 18 rules still 
renders much better performance to improve the traffic flow. Furthermore, the adaptive-fuzzy controller leads to the 
best performance, especially in the results of Peak condition, to prove that the adaptive function is more capable as the 
traffic flow rate is varying significantly.

3). Time difference in MAS coordination 
The present CTA can coordinate the time difference for neighboring intersections to change traffic signals 
synchronously with a fixed time delay, As described in TABLE III, the AF agent controllers with different time delay 
as 2, 4, and 7 seconds, separately, as (1) AF agents_D2, (2) AF agents_D4, and (3) AF agents_D7 will also be tested. 
Fig. 9 shows that AF agents_D2 with delay time 2 seconds leads to the best performance in 14 cases among total 36 
cases for medium traffic flow rates. For the light traffic flow conditions as the flow rate is lower than 600 veh./hr, the 
AF agents_D4 is more suitable and to achieve 13 best cases. For the AF agents_D7, it performs the best 5 cases only as 
the traffic flow is heavy. Therefore, under different conditions, the AF agent method is preferred with different time 
delay to achieve the best performance.  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the input parameters of the queuing length and the cycle starting time are adopted to design the fuzzy 
control for a single intersection, with 18 rules only. To deal with the traffic jam during the rush hours, the increasing 
threshold value for changing signals is further applied as an adaptive fuzzy controller to improve 42.7% in the delay 
time compared with the traditional fixed-time control approach. 
 Furthermore, because a large traffic network is more complicated than a single intersection, the adaptive-fuzzy 
MAS is proposed to extend the applications of the adaptive-fuzzy system combining with MAS as the AF agent_D2/D4 
to achieve the improvement around 45% for the traffic network.
