One of the major challenges in systems biology today is 
to devise generally robust methods of interpreting this data in 
a way that will shed light on the complex relationships 
between multiple genes and their products. Such 
methodology is important both as an aid to arenas of research 
like drug discovery and design, but also as a powerful tool 
toward deeper understanding of the interactions among all 
the components in a biological system as well as their 
collective behavior. 
In particular, one crucial goal within systems biology is 
to develop the capability for analyzing biological interaction 
networks as they respond to different environments. 
Groundwork with respect to this goal has been laid in 
seminal contributions from Ideker et al. [1], [2] and Zien et 
al. [3]. Such a capability is of significant importance for the 
understanding of biological activities on a systems level that 
eventually leads to the identification of risk factors of genetic 
disorders as well as the prevention of infection from bacterial 
pathogens. More recent work, including [4] and [5], followed 
this line of research to reveal the role of transcription factors 
in biological systems and/or environments. In addition, 
Desmeulles et al. [6] studied generic models by numerical 
simulations for systems biology, in order for different 
biologists to work around an interdisciplinary subject and 
also permit to embed different expert system modeling 
methods like fuzzy cognitive maps. Here we review a 
method for analyzing biological response data from gene-
expression arrays by combining it with computationally 
derived network information. Then we show how the 
PCMAS (Probability Collectives Multi-agent Systems) can 
be used as an optimization tool for network construction, 
thereby shedding light on discovering crucial components in 
specific drug response networks. 
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 
presents the preliminaries for biological network 
construction. In Section 3, a review of PC is provided. In 
Section 4 we present empirical results and discussions for 
optimization of biological network construction of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) using 
PCMAS. We then conclude this paper in Section 5. 
 
II. PRIOR WORK 
In this section we review the method of the response 
network developed by [8], which is comprised of various 
steps, including, (i) M. tuberculosis network construction by 
computational methods, (ii) network filtering and response 
network identification by superimposing experimental gene 
expression data upon the computationally derived M. 
tuberculosis network and (iii) differential network expression 
analysis. 
In the case of biological networks, depending on the 
particular network representation, node properties can 
include gene, protein or chemical names, and edge properties 
may refer to specific interactions, such as binding or 
catalysis. 
In order to construct the M. tuberculosis network, 
Cabusora et al. [8] identified three types of interactions as 
relevant for such a network: (i) protein interaction, (ii) 
metabolic reactions and (iii) co-expression in regulons. For 
protein interaction data, Cabusora et al. used identified 
component genes fused together into one single gene (with 
multiple functions according to the functions of the 
component genes) according to Enright et al. [9],[10]. This 
method for recognizing possible interacting proteins is called 
the Rosetta Stone approach [10], which is based on the 
observation that individual genes in one organism that are 
fused into a single chain in another organism are likely to 
interact physically with each other. 
In this study, the gene expression information from M. 
tuberculosis (H37Rv) was obtained after its growth in 
Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with albumin/dextrose/ 
NaCl/glycerol, Dubos medium or defined minimal medium 
[11]. Cultures were grown before adding either drug or 
solvent, and RNA was isolated at selected intervals thereafter. 
For the drug-treated culture, a parallel culture was treated 
with an equivalent amount of solvent (DMSO, ethanol or 
water) for the same amount of time. RNA from the latter 
culture was used as the reference sample to which the drug-
treated sample was compared. The gene expression data is 
accessible through the Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI 
(GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with GEO 
platform accession number GPL1396. 
A. Algorithm and Implementation 
The algorithm employed by [8] is implemented as 
follows. After the large biological network is constructed, it 
is stored as a Petri-Net [12], converted into a node graph, 
stripped of ubiquitous chemicals according to a maximal 
permissible node degree and loaded with gene-expression 
values. In addition, input parameters, such as the k-value for 
k-shortest path calculation and the maximal path-length l, are 
set. In the next step, the network is filtered according to the 
parameters and a set of seed nodes. The core of the algorithm 
is the component that scores particular sub-networks, 
yielding a sub-network with the highest score. Further 
components of the algorithm include a statistical analysis 
routine for sub-network score validation and a network 
algebra component for differential network analysis. A flow 
diagram of the corresponding processes is shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Global Architecture of the algorithm 
In [22] several benchmark testbeds were first studied to 
compare PCMAS with GA, which bear important 
characteristics of search space such as multimodality, 
nonlinearity and non-separability. Using these problems 
Huang et al. [22] showed that PC can outperform GA in the 
rate of descent, trapping in false minima and long term 
optimization. More recently, Huang and Chang [23] 
presented a study on PCMAS and concluded the search by 
the PCMAS is more robust than that of the GA. 
Also recently, the summary for PC by kulkarni and Tai [7] 
indicated several advantages of PC that make it a 
competitive choice over other algorithms. In a nutshell, PC 
has the following advantages that can facilitate optimization 
tasks: 
 
1. PC is a distributed solution approach in which each 
agent independently updates its probability distribution 
at any instant and can be applied to continuous, 
discrete or mixed variables, etc. 
2. In PC the probability of the strategy set is always a 
vector of real numbers, thereby allowing the 
techniques of the straightforward optimization for 
Euclidean vectors, such as gradient descent, to be 
applicable. 
3. PC is robust in the sense that the cost function can be 
irregular or noisy. PC also provides the sensitivity 
information about the problem in the sense that a 
variable with a peaky distribution plays a more 
important role in the optimization task than a variable 
with a broad distribution. In essence, peaky 
distribution provides the best choice of action that 
contributes most to the optimization of the global 
utility. 
4. The computational and communication load is 
marginally less and equally distributed among all the 
agents. Thus the framework of PC enables an efficient 
way to handle large-scale problems with many 
variables. 
      Since PCMAS has been proven as an effective 
methodology in solving combinatorial optimization, here we 
naturally intend to investigate how this approach can be 
employed to study complex biological problems, in 
particular, to solve the NP-hard combinatorial optimization 
problem for biological network construction.  
In a nutshell, the core of PCMAS is an update process of 
each agent's probability distribution qi(xi) that prescribes a 
mixed strategy over player
 
i’s possible pure strategies. Using 
Newton updating and enforcing the constraint on total 
probability, the following update rule at each iteration is 
obtained [23]: 
×−→ )()()( iiiiii xqxqxq α
 
)},(ln)(/])[]|[{( iiii xqqSTGExGE ++−
 
(1) 
 
where α plays the role of a step size. The step size is required 
since the expectations result from the current probability 
distributions of all the agents. To perform the gradient 
descent in probability space each agent must estimate the 
expected value of any of its actions, E[G|xi], from Monte-
Carlo samples. Briefly, optimization proceeds in alternating 
rounds of Monte-Carlo sampling blocks, and updates to the 
agent’s probability distribution over the parameter value. To 
draw a Monte-Carlo sample each agent chooses the value for 
its parameter xi from its current probability distribution, and 
the world cost function G(x) is evaluated. 
The number of samples in each Monte-Carlo block 
determines accuracy of the expected cost estimate. If 
sampling the objective function is costly, one may wish to 
gain the most information from the least number of samples. 
The kernel density estimation implies and exploits weak 
prior knowledge about smooth interpolation between the 
sample points. Additionally, samples from the previous 
iterations may be re-used by geometrically weighting them 
according to their “age” in iterations. The imperfections that 
these augmentations introduce can be considered as another 
contribution to the bounded rationality term that broadens the 
probability distribution. The primary free parameters in the 
optimization are the Gaussian kernel width (τ), the rate of 
cooling (δT/T), the number of Monte-Carlo samples per 
iteration, the proportional step size in the gradient descent (α), 
and data-aging rate (γ). 
The procedure for updating temperature T in PCMAS, 
referred to as the annealing schedule, plays an important role 
in the efficiency and reliability of the approach [24]. 
Typically, a geometric schedule is applied, which involves 
multiplying the temperature by some fixed factor every 
several iterations. The detailed steps of the PCMAS are 
described in the following [24]: 
 
1. Initialize 
A. Set the initial parameters, including temperature T 
and assign the annealing schedule for T as a 
function of iteration number. 
B. Specify the number of Monte-Carlo samples N for 
each iteration. 
C. Assign agents to the variables in the problem, with 
their actions representing choices for values. Set the 
starting probabilities for each agent to uniform over 
its possible actions. 
D. Set the termination criteria. 
2. Minimize the lagrangian 
A. Monte-Carlo sample the agent probabilities to obtain 
N joint actions. 
B. For each sample, evaluate the objective function and 
compute the private utility for each agent. 
C. Compute the expected utilities for the agents for each 
of their possible moves using a regression. 
D. Update the probability distributions using Eq. (1). 
E. Update the parameters. Use the assigned annealing 
schedule for T. 
F. Evaluate the termination criteria. If not satisfied, 
return to step 2(a), otherwise proceed to 3. 
3. Evaluation 
A. Determine the highest probability action for each 
agent. 
B. Evaluate the objective function with this set of 
actions.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this study we demonstrated a robust combinational 
optimization method for biological network construction 
using the Probability Collectives Multi-agent Systems to 
examine and to interpret expression data in the context of 
network connectivity. The computational means is flexible 
enough to accommodate new information about protein or 
gene interactions, which facilitates hypotheses about 
biological problems on a systems level. 
This approach to constructing response networks and 
optimization enables prediction and easy identification of 
crucial sub-networks in biological networks under the 
presence of specific drugs. Such comparison of the response 
networks thus facilitates the identification of important nodes 
for potential drug targets. In this paper, we employ the 95% 
confidence intervals as the measurement of robustness of the 
search algorithms. We show that the search of the PCMAS 
generates narrow confidence intervals and thus yields 
reliable models for the construction of the response networks. 
There are other statistics approaches that one can use to this 
end, such as cross-validation and bootstrapping [28]. This 
line of research is our proposed future work. 
In summary, the PCMAS methodology provides an 
excellent systems biology tool for research on biological 
networks. In particular, the case study on ofloxacin drug 
response of M. tuberculosis highlights the interconnectivity 
of cellular processes and thus sheds light into target 
identification for future drug discovery efforts.
