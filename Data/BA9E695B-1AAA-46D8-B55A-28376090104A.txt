were formed by the catalysis of Fe nanoparticles embedded in the carbon fibers by exposing the fibers to 
hexane vapor.[25] Ostermann et al. also synthesized single-crystal V2O5 nanorods grown on electrospun 
TiO2 nanofibers by calcining composite nanofibers consisting of V2O5, TiO2, and poly(vinylpyrrolidone).[26] 
Even though hierarchical structures were generated by various methods, most methods to fabricate 
hierarchical structures using electrospun fibers still fail to generate the second length scale of ordering in a 
controlled way. Comparing to those materials, here we prepare hierarchical polymer structures, in which 
the sizes of the nanorods and the fibers can be well controlled. 
 
Experimental 
Polystyrene (PS) (Mn: 22900; Mw: 166500; PDI: 7.27) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Mn: 
26600; Mw: 49300; PDI: 1.85 ) and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Benzyltriethylammonium chloride 
(BTEAC) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) 
were obtained from TEDIA. The commercial AAO membranes (pore diameter ca. 100–400 nm, thickness 
∼ 60 μm) were purchased from Whatman Ltd. The synthesized AAO templates were prepared according to 
the two-step anodization method developed by Masuda and co-workers.[9, 28] First, a high-purity aluminum 
sheet (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.5 mm thick, 99.99 %) was degreased in acetone and rinsed in an ethanol solution. 
Later, the aluminum sheet was electropolished in a perchloric acid/ethanol mixture at 4 °C. The aluminum 
sheet was anodized at 40 V in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 17 °C for 12 hr. Followed by the resultant aluminum 
oxide film was chemically etched in a mixture of phosphochromic acid, a second anodization under the 
same conditions as for the first anodization was performed for different periods of time, depending on the 
required length of pores. The length of the pores is ∼ 4 μm and the second anodization is carried out for 2 
hr. 
For a typical electrospinning experiment, 35 wt% PMMA (Mw: 49 kg/mol) solution in DMF was 
added into a syringe connected to a nozzle (inner diameter: 0.41 mm). The polymer solution was fed at a 
constant rate (1 mL/hr) through a syringe pump (brand: KD Scientific). The nozzle was connected to a 
high-voltage power supply (brand: SIMCO). The typical applied voltage range was 10-30 kV. The working 
distance range between the nozzle and the grounded collector was 10-20 cm. For most experiments, the 
organic salt BTEAC was added to control the smoothness and the size of the electrospun fibers. After the 
electrospun fibers were brought into contact with the AAO templates, the samples were heated at 135 or 
150 oC for different times. The AAO templates were removed with 5 wt% NaOH(aq) for 12 hr, and the 
samples were repeatedly washed with water, followed by dying in vacuum. The microscopic features of the 
samples were studied using a JEOL JSM-7401F scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating 
voltage of 10 kV. The samples were coated with 4 nm platinum before performing SEM measurements. 
 
Results and Discussion 
A schematic plot of our approach to prepare the hierarchical structure is presented in Figure 1. 
Polymer fibers are generated by electrospinning. First, the polymers are dissolved in a suitable solvent such 
as DMF and are ejected from a capillary nozzle. Under the electric field, the polymer solution is drawn into 
a polymer jet at the end of the nozzle followed by a whipping process due to electrostatic repulsion.[29] The 
nanometer- or micrometer-sized polymer fibers are collected on the grounded collector after solvent 
evaporation. The fibers are then collected and are placed on top of an AAO membrane. Commercial AAO

The electrospinning method is a useful technique to make polymer fibers. If suitable solvents are 
available, almost all kinds of polymers can be made as fibers by the electrospinning method. The size and 
morphology of the electrospun polymer fibers are controlled by different experimental factors such as 
polymer molecular weight, solution concentration, solvent, flow rate, voltage, nozzle size, or working 
distance.[30] Figure 2 displays the SEM images of electrospun fibers under different conditions. The 
concentration of the polymer solution is one of the most common ways to control the size and morphology of 
the electrospun fibers. When the polymer concentration is lower than a critical value, the viscosity of the 
solution is not high enough to maintain a stable polymer jet. The polymer liquid jet might break into droplets 
caused by the Rayleigh instability, and polymer fibers are unable to be formed.[31] For low solution viscosity, 
beads-on-string structures are also observed caused by the entanglement of polymer chains and the 
contraction of the jet,[32] as shown in Figure 2a. When the viscosity of the solution is larger, both the size of 
the beads and the distance between beads increase.[32] If the polymer concentration is higher than a critical 
value, polymer fibers without beaded defects are formed. In general, the diameter of the electrospun polymer 
fiber increases with the concentration of the polymer solution. Figure 2a-c show the polymer fibers generated 
from different concentrations while keeping all other experimental factors constant. Poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(PMMA) (Mw: 49k) was dissolved in DMF at different concentrations (Fig. 2a: 25 wt%; Fig. 2b: 30 wt%; Fig. 
2c: 35 wt%) with the flow rate of 1 mL/hr and working distance of 10 cm under the voltage of 15 kV. The 
diameters of the electrospun PMMA fibers increase from ~ 1 μm for 25 wt% to ~ 4 μm for 35 wt%. It has to 
be noted that the polymer solution might be difficult to be ejected from the nozzle when the concentration is 
too high because of the increased viscosity. In addition to the polymer concentration, the solution viscosity is 
also determined by the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymers.[33] It has been 
reported that the onset of uniform fiber formation in relative broader molecular weight distribution polymers 
occurs at a higher concentration comparing with that in the narrow molecular weight distribution polymers. 
These results are because a relatively broad molecular distribution polymer has a wide distribution of the 
hydrodynamic radii and relaxation times of the chains in solution.[33]  
The second method to control the diameters of the electrospun fibers is by varying the flow rate. The 
amount of the produced polymer fibers is proportional to the flow rate, and the diameter of the polymer fibers 
increases as the flow rate increases. Fridrikh et al. showed that varying the flow rate yields a 102/3 (~6) fold 
variation in the fiber diameter when the flow rate is over a certain range.[34] But if the flow rate is too fast, 
beaded fibers are formed. The electrospun fibers might also be partially dissolved by the residual solvent if 
the flow rate is too fast, and the morphology of the fiber can be affected. Figure 2d-f show the SEM images of 
electrospun fibers (49 k PMMA; 35 wt% in DMF; voltage: 10 kV; working distance: 15 cm) at different flow 
rates ((d) 0.1 mL/hr; (e) 0.5 mL/hr; (f) 2.0 mL/hr). The average diameters of the fibers are larger when the 
flow rates are higher, and the relationship between the fiber diameters and the flow rate is plotted in the 
Supporting Information. The diameters and morphology of the electrospun fibers can also be controlled by 
other experimental conditions such as the applied voltage. When the applied voltage is higher, the electric 
field and the electrostatic force are stronger, resulting in the smaller diameters of the electrospun fibers.[35]    
The anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes are used to control the second length scale of ordering 
on the electrospun polymer fibers. AAO templates are made by anodization of aluminum plates, and the 
pore density can be as high as 1011 pores/cm2.[36] In this work, we used two different kinds of AAO 
membranes as the templates, including the commercial AAO templates and the synthesized AAO templates.

where t is the time, z is the rod height, γ is the surface tension, θ is the contact angle, η is the viscosity, and R 
is the hydraulic radius (the ratio between the volume of the polymer in the pore and the area of solid/liquid 
interface). Therefore, the length of the polymer rods in the nanopores can be increased by using longer 
annealing time or lower polymer viscosity. The wetting behavior of polymer melts in cylindrical 
nanochannels was also studied by Zhang et al. that the polymer can be formed as nanorods or nanotubes 
depending on whether the polymer is in the partial wetting state or in the complete wetting state.[39] The 
wetting transition from the partial wetting state to the complete wetting state depends on the molecular weight 
and molecular weight distribution of the polymers. For higher molecular weight polymers, the temperature of 
wetting transition is also higher. The difference in the wetting rate between partial and complete wetting can 
be used to fractionate polymers with different molecular weights.[39]

wetting into the nanopores of commercial AAO templates. The PMMA fibers were annealed at 150 oC for 
30 min. The lengths of the nanorods are ~ 100 nm. (c-d). Electrospun PMMA fibers wetting into the 
nanopores of synthesized AAO templates. 
 
We note that there are only limited surfaces of the polymer fibers that are in contact with the 
nanopores of the AAO template before thermal annealing because of the cylindrical shape of the fibers. 
When the sample is heated above the glass transition temperature of the polymer, only polymers in these 
regions are initially drawn into the nanopores. At longer annealing time, larger surfaces of the polymer 
fibers are in contact with the template, and more polymers are drawn into the nanopores. Thus, there is a 
distribution in the length of the nanorods on the polymer fibers. The idea case is that the height of the 
 8
polymer fibers after thermal annealing is that the fibers may undergo surface undulation and break into 
spheres, the so-called Rayleigh-instability.[40] But this kind of instability was not observed in this work, 
which might be explained by the high viscosity and the strong polymer chain-chain interaction.

electrospun fibers were prepared from PMMA (Mw: 49k) and were annealed at 150 oC for 10 min. 
 
To show the universality of this work, we also study the fabrication of hierarchical structures by using 
polystyrene (PS), another commonly used polymer. As shown in Figure 7a, electrospun PS fibers are first 
obtained by electrospinning 20 wt% PS (Mw: 166k) in DMF under a voltage of 15 kV at a flow rate of 
1mL/hr with a working distance of 15 cm. The diameters of the as-spun fibers are ~ 2-3 μm. After the PS 
fibers are brought into contact with a synthesized AAO template (pore diameters ~ 50 nm) followed by an 
annealing process at 135 oC for 15 min, hierarchical PS structures are obtained (see Figure 7b).

20 wt% PS in DMF under a voltage of 15 kV at a flow rate of 1mL/hr with a working distance of 15 cm. The 
fiber diameters are ~ 2-3 μm. (b) A SEM image of an electrospun PS fiber with nanorods. The PS fiber was

Conclusions and Suggestions  
In this report, we demonstrate a simple approach to fabricate hierarchical structures by placing 
electrospun polymer fibers in contact with the nanopores of AAO templates. The advantage of this technique 
is that the two size scales of ordering can be independently controlled. The first length scale is controlled by 
the diameters of the electrospun fibers, which can be controlled by changing the electrospinning conditions

Recently, one‐dimensional (1‐D) polymer nanomaterials have attracted great interests because of their 
unique properties and potential applications. However, there have been relatively few studies on the 
generation of one‐dimensional polymer nanomaterials. Here, we study the fabrication and characterization 
of different polymer‐related nanomaterials by using a simple template method. The templates we chose 
were anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates because of the regular pore distribution, high pore density, 
and high aspect ratio of the pores. Different nanomaterials such as amorphous carbon nanotubes, 
amphiphilic block copolymer nanotubes, and porous inorganic materials were fabricated by using AAO 
templates. We also studied the instabilities of polymer nanomaterials under confinement within the 
cylindrical pores. Moreover, the AAO template is used to generate hierarchical structures by the wetting of 
polymer microspheres.
