both constructed on the SnO2/carbon 
electrode. 
Recently, various biosensors have 
emerged from laboratories, because of the 
advantages of simple measurement, a short 
response time, high sensitivity and high 
selectivity. Most biosensors are based on 
amperometric principles [9-12], the detection 
of oxygen consumption [13, 14], 
chemiluminescence [15, 16] and the 
detection of fluoride ions [17]. 
In this study, SnO2 thin film was 
successfully sputtered onto a carbon 
electrode. Due to the electrical property of 
the SnO2 thin film, it was suitable to be as 
the electrode material for integrating the 
detection of pH and glucose in one system. A 
linear response was observed in buffer 
solutions of pH2–pH12 with the sensitivity 
of 56.35mV/pH.

Reagents 
     Analytical grade reagents were used to 
prepare buffer solutions. Deionized (D.I.) 
water was used for all experiments. Materials 
used in the ion-selective membrane 
preparation were as follows: nonactin was 
purchased from Fluka, bis-(2-etylhexyl) 
sebacate (DOS), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 
carboxylated polyvinylchloride (PVC-COOH) 
were all purchased from Aldrich. A 
plastic-plate using photocrosslinkable 
polyvinyl alcohol containing stilbazolium 
groups (PVA-SbQ) was purchased from Toyo 
Gosei Co., Ltd., Japan. Urease, Creatinine 
(EC 3.5.4.21 from microorganism, at activity 
260 units) and uricase were all purchased 
from Sigma. And the Ag/AgCl reference 
electrode was purchased from Sesnsorex. 
 
SnO2 pH sensor fabrication 
Separative extended-gate field effect 
transistor was used in this study. This 
structure was divided into two parts, one was 
sensing region containing the sensing 
membrane, and the other was MOSFET 
region. Metal oxide thin films were 
deposited on the ITO glass by the sputtering 
system. 
 
Preparation of urea electrode 
There are a lot of enzyme 
immobilization techniques for preparation of 
the enzyme membrane of biosensor for uric 
acid, such as adsorption, entrapment, 
covalent bonding, and crosslinking. In this 
study, the polyacrylamide was used to entrap 
enzyme, and the carbon paste electrode was 
modified with 3%w/w catalase, 7%w/w 
uricase and ferrocenemonocarboxylic acid. 
In the preparation of the enzyme membrane 
of urea biosensor, urease was immobilized 
by the entrapment method. A liquid 
pre-polymer solution was obtained by 
mixing the enzyme and PVA-SbQ (125 mg) 
in a 5 mM phosphate buffer solution at pH 
7.0. Then, the pre-polymer solution (2 µl) 
was dropped onto the sensitive membrane 
and the SnO2 membrane has the surface area 
of 4mm2 (2×2 mm2). The membranes were 
then exposed to UV light at 365 nm for 
around 20 minutes for polymerization and 
stored at 4°C for 24 hours in the dark room. 
The general construction of the biosensor 
was shown in Fig.1. 
 
Preparation of creatinine electrode  
In the preparation of the enzyme 
membrane of creatinine biosensor, creatinine 
iminohydrolase was immobilized by the 
entrapment method. A liquid pre-polymer 
solution was obtained by mixing the enzyme 
and PVA-SbQ (125 mg) in a 5 mM 
phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0. Then, 
the pre-polymer solution (2 µl) was dropped 
onto the sensitive membrane and the SnO2 
membrane has the surface area of 4mm2 (2×2 
mm2). The membranes were then exposed to 
UV light at 365 nm for around 20 minutes 
for polymerization and stored at 4°C for 24 
hours in the dark room.

Integrated Circuits 
The chip was achieved by TSMC 
CMOS 0.35um 2P4M process technology. 
The circuit system could be used to detect 
voltage and current signal for sensors. The 
work frequency was under 200Hz. The low 
supply voltage was operated at 1.5V. The 
voltage signal detection circuit was 
composed of instrumentation amplifier. The 
current signal integrated amplifier circuit 
useed no compensation capacitance and had 
the small layout area of the circuit. We 
designed it with two current-mirrors for 
differential input, the output connected with 
current-source inverter. The layout of voltage 
amplifier was shown in Fig.7 and the layout 
of current amplifier was shown in Fig.8.
