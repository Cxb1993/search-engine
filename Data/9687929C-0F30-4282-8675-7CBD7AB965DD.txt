Abstract  
The research aims to investigate the 
interlaminar fracture toughness of glass 
fiber/epoxy composites, which consist of the silica 
nanoparticles and the rubber particles.  Two kinds 
of rubber particles, one is the reactive liquid rubber 
(CTBN) and the other is the core-shell rubber 
(CSR), were employed to modify the fracture 
toughness of epoxy resin.  In general, the 
disadvantage of adding rubber particles into 
polymeric resin is the dramatic reduction of 
stiffness although the toughness could be modified 
accordingly. In order to enhance the fracture 
toughness of the fiber composites without 
sacrificing their stiffness, the silica nanoparticles in 
conjunction with the rubber particles were 
introduced into the epoxy matrix to form a hybrid 
nanocomposite.  Experimental results obtained 
from tensile tests on bulk epoxy confirm the 
presumption that the reduction of the epoxy 
stiffness because of the presence of rubber particles 
can be effectively compensated by the silica 
nanoparticles. Furthermore, the fracture tests 
conducted on the DCB specimens revealed that the 
inclusion of silica nanoparticles together with the 
CSR particle can appreciably increase the fracture 
toughness of the glass/epoxy composites up to 82%. 
On the other hand, when the epoxy matrices were 
modified with CTBN rubber particles and silica 
nanoparticles, the improvement of the interlaminar 
fracture  toughness was around 48%.

1. Introduction 
With the features of high stiffness, strength, and 
low weight, the high performance composites have 
been extensively utilized not only in the aerospace 
industry, but also in marine, armor, automotive, 
and civil engineering applications. However, for 
the laminated composites, the interlaminar 
delamination is the main failure mode, which 
results in the unacceptable reduction of material 
performances. Therefore, modifying the 
delamination fracture toughness of high 
performance composites, especially for composites 
 When the silica/CSR/epoxy nanocomposite 
samples were prepared, a desired amount of 
Nanopox@ F400 resin was diluted with DGEBA 
resin, depending on the required weight 
percentage of silica nanoparticles. The mixture 
was then sonicated using a sonicator with a 
cooling system around the sample container so 
that the nanoparticles were displaced uniformly in 
the epoxy resin. The epoxy–silica mixture was 
degassed at room temperature in a vacuum oven 
for 10 minutes and then mixed with the CSR 
rubber.  The mixture was blended at 80 ˚C for 360 
minutes using a mechanical stirrer, followed by 
the degassing process for another 5 minutes in the 
vacuum oven. After cooling down into the room 
temperature, the final compounding was mixed 
with the curing agent using the mechanical 
mixture for 10 minutes. Afterward, the mixture 
was poured into the designed steel mold with 
Teflon coating on its surfaces to form the 
nanocomposite specimens. Subsequently, the 
samples were cured at 100˚C for 3 hours with an 
additional 3 hours at 125˚C for post-curing.  In the 
study, the nanocomposites containing 10 and 20 
wt% silica nanoparticle, 10 wt% CSR particles, 10 
wt% silica together with 10 wt% CSR particles 
were prepared, respectively.  
On the other hand, for the preparation of the 
silica/CTBN/epoxy nanocomposite, the desired 
amount of the Nanopox@ F400 resin together with 
DGEBA resin and CTBN were mixed evenly using 
the mechanical mixture for 10 minutes at room 
temperature followed by the sonication for another 
20 minutes. Subsequently, the degassing was 
carried out on the mixture in the vacuum oven for 
120 minutes at 100˚C.  After the compounding is 
cooled down, it was blended with the curing agent 
for 10 minutes and then the whole mixtures were 
degassed at room temperature for 10 minutes. For 
the sake of comparison, the nanocomposites with 
10 wt% CTBN particles and 10 wt% silica 
nanoparticles together with 10 wt% CTBN 
particles were manufactured. 
 
2.2 Fabrication of glass fiber/silica/ rubber/ 
epoxy nanocomposites 
When the epoxy resins modified with different 
contents of particles were prepared through 
vacuum-assisted hand lay-up procedures, they 
were diffused into unidirectional fibers to form the 
glass fiber/silica/rubber/epoxy composites. The 
process is that the final mixture epoxy resin with 
the H-100 curing agent was poured on one dry 
unidirectional glass fiber layer (provided by 
Vectorply®, E-LR0908-14 unidirectional E-glass 
fiber) and then impregnated into the dry fibers with 
the assistance of a hand roller until the fiber 
bundles were permeated completely by the resin.  
Then, another ply of dry fiber was stacked on it.  
The repeating process continued until the 12 layers 
of glass fibers were fabricated. Since the 
interlaminar fracture toughness of composites was 
measured from the double cantilever beam (DCB) 
specimens, during the process, a porous film was 
inserted in the mid-plane of the laminates for the 
creation of pre-crack.  The entire stacking was then 
sandwiched between two steel plates with porous 
Teflon fabric on the surfaces and then sealed within 
a vacuum bag. The whole laminates were cured in 
a hot press with a suggested temperature profile 
under vacuum conditions. 
 
3. Materials Characterization 
To understand the degree of exfoliation of the 
silica nanoparticle as well as the rubber particles in 
the epoxy resin, the hybrid nanocomposite samples 
were examined using a Transmission Electron 
Microscope (TEM), which is a widespread method 
for providing direct visualization on the spatial 
distribution of the nanoparticles as well as for 
characterizing the microstructures of particulate 
nanocomposites.  Thin film samples of 
silica/CTBN/epoxy and silica/CSR/epoxy 
nanocomposites (about 80 nm thick) were cut from 
the specimens, respectively, using a Reichert-Jung 
Ultracut microtome, and the associated morphology 
was imaged using a JEOL 200CX transmission 
electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 
120KV.  The results with the magnification of 20K 
were shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b) for the two 
different hybrid systems, respectively. From the 
micrographics, the diameters of the CTBN and CSR 
particles are measured as about 150–250 nm and 
 more or less close to that in pure epoxy. To further 
investigate the effect of the silica particles together 
with the rubber particles on the Mode I fracture 
toughness (KIC) of the nanocomposites, the SENB 
specimens were fabricated and then employed in 
the three-point-bending tests. The dimensions of 
the SENB specimens are suggested based on 
ASTM D5045 [7].  During the experiments, at least 
four specimens were tested in each case for the 
measurements of fracture toughness.   
From the three point bending tests, the fracture 
toughness of SENB samples can be calculated 
using the following formulation [8]:

where PI indicates the peak load in the load and 
deflection curves, and x is a dimensionless value 
equal to the pre-crack length, a, divided by the 
sample height, W. The fracture tests were carried 
out on the servo-electrical control machine 
(HT-2102BP) at a displacement rate of 0.05 
mm/min. The peak value of the force was regarded 
as the failure load, PI, and employed in the 
calculation of the fracture toughness given in Eq. 
(1). For the linear elastic materials, the fracture 
toughness KIC can be related to the fracture energy 
GIC in terms of the material constants as

where E is the Young’s modulus and ν  is the 
Poisson’s ratio equaling to 0.34.  Table 1 illustrates 
the variations of fracture energy of the 
nanocomposites modified with various kinds of 
particles.  Apparently, for the bulk epoxy, the 
fracture energy of nanocomposites increases with 
the addition of the silica nanoparticles, and the 
enhancement can be improved significantly as the 
rubber particles are added.  Nevertheless, for the 
nanocomposites with hybrid particles, the fracture 
toughness is lower than those with only rubber 
particles included. Therefore, it was concluded that 
introducing the rubber particles into epoxy resin is 
the most effective way to toughen the fracture 
toughness of bulk epoxy, and moreover, the 
effectiveness of the rubber particles could be 
moderated once silica nanoparticles are also 
included in the samples.

4.2   Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of 
glass fiber/Silica/rubber/epoxy nanocomposites 
Interlaminar fracture toughness was evaluated 
from the double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens 
that were made of 12-ply unidirectional laminates 
with a porous film inserted in the mid-plane during 
the lay-up process for creating the initial crack.  
The dimensions of the DCB specimen are 230 mm 
long, 20 mm wide and 3.3 mm thick as shown in 
Fig. 3 Symmetric loadings applied in opposite 
directions were transferred into the cracked end of 
the specimens through a pair of hinges bonded on 
the specimen surfaces resulting in the mode I crack 
extension.  Prior to the fracture tests, the DCB 
specimens were pulled out such that the pre-crack 
can extend around 4 mm penetrating the resin 
enriched area and reach the “true” crack tip where 
the fracture toughness begin to be measured. 
During testing, the initial crosshead rate is 3 
mm/min and then reduced to 0.5 mm/min before 
the onset of delamination extension.  All specimen

5. Discussions 
To understand the effect of the silica 
nanoparticle on the bulk epoxy fracture toughness 
as well as the interlaminar fracture toughness of the 
fiber composites, the experimental data shown in 
Tables 1 and 2 was re-plotted in Fig. 7. It is noted 
that in the figure, the solid symbols indicate the 
samples without silica nanoparticles while the 
hollow symbols denote their counterparts’ 
consisting of silica nanoparticles. The arrows in the 
figure represent the tendency of the fracture energy 
when silica nanoparticles were included. For the 
brittle epoxy system (diamond symbol), the GIC 
value of fiber composites is greater than the bulk 
epoxy fracture toughness, and the addition of silica 
can efficiently enhance the epoxy toughness and 
the interlaminar toughness of composites as well. 
When the CTBN rubber was utilized to modify the 
epoxy, a significant toughening effect was found in 
the bulk epoxy (solid circle symbol); however, the 
incremental increase in the fiber composites is not 
so significant.  Once the silica nanoparticles were 
introduced into CTBN-modified bulk epoxy, since 
the fracture energy of the modified epoxy is 
already 1.2kJ/m2 (pretty ductile), the function of 
silica nanoparticles is destructive. On the other 
hand, for the CTBN-modified fiber composites, it 
was observed that the silica nanoparticles still have 
a toughening effect on the interlaminar fracture 
toughness although the fracture energy of the 
CTBN-modified fiber composites is around 
1.0kJ/m2.  Finally, for the CSR-modified bulk 
epoxy and fiber composites, because the fracture 
energy is around 1.42kJ/m2 and 1.6kJ/m2, 
respectively, the influence of the nanoparticle on 
the fracture properties becomes devastating. In 
light of the forgoing examinations, it is suggested 
that when the GIC value of bulk epoxy is over 
1.2kJ/m2, the contribution of silica nanoparticles 
may not be constructive. Similarly, for the fiber 
composites with higher fracture energy (greater 
than 1.6kJ/m2), the introduction of silica 
nanoparticles would reduced the corresponding 
fracture toughness.  In addition, from Tables 1 and 
2, it is shown that the increment of the fracture 
energy in bulk epoxy is always greater than that in 
fiber composites associated with the same amount 
of the particle modification. As a result, the transfer 
efficiency of epoxy toughness to the interlaminar 
fracture toughness of fiber composites is poor
