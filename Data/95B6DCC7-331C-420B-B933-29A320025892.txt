Linear Property of the Screw Surface of the Spatial RPRP Linkage 
This paper investigates the screw surface of the RPRP linkage, an overconstrained linkage with 
mobility one. The screw surface is a ruled surface containing screws for displacing the coupler of 
the RPRP linkage from one reference position to all reachable positions. In this paper, two types of 
RPRP linkages, in folded and unfolded forms, are constructed by using hexahedrons in accordance 
with Delassus’ criteria. It is shown that the screw surfaces of both types of RPRP linkages can be 
represented by screw systems of the second order. These novel finite screw systems are obtained by 
intersecting two 3-systems corresponding to the finite displacements of the RP and PR dyads. The 
intersection of finite screw systems is conducted by employing the intersection operation of vector 
subspaces of the six-dimensional vector space. 
2.1 Introduction 
Delassus [1] derived all the four-bar linkages composed of lower pairs with connectivity one. If 
one considers only revolute (R) and prismatic (P) joints, there are three spatial overconstrained 
linkages with connectivity sum four: the spatial 4P, the spatial 4R, and the spatial RPRP linkages. 
The motion of the spatial 4P is obvious, and the spatial 4R linkage is the famous Bennett 
mechanism [2]. However, the motion of the RPRP has drawn less research attention. This paper 
investigates the finite motion of the RPRP linkage, with an emphasis on the linear property of its 
screw surface. A screw surface[3], analogous to the rotation curve [4, 5] of a two-dimensional 
motion, is a ruled surface containing screws for finite displacements that bring a rigid body, in one-
degree-of-freedom spatial motion, from one reference position to all possible positions. The screw 
surfaces of overconstrained linkages are of special interest here because they can form screw 
systems. 
Until recently, most research in overconstrained linkages has focused on the mobility and 
instantaneous kinematic geometry of the linkages. Then Huang [6] demonstrated that the screw 
surface of the Bennett mechanism formed a 2-system. This 2-system was obtained by intersecting 
two 3-systems [7], corresponding to the RR dyads forming the Bennett mechanism. Remarkably, 
this linear property of the Bennett mechanism can also be found in most Bennett-based mechanisms 
[8, 9]. The discovery of finite screw systems is relatively novel in kinematic geometry because finite 
kinematics, unlike instantaneous kinematics, had been considered to be nonlinear. In addition to 
their theoretical importance in kinematic geometry, finite screw systems can substantially simplify 
the analysis and synthesis of spatial linkages [10, 11]. 
  20 
in general, it is not mobile. However, this linkage can possess mobility one if the revolute joints are 
parallel and the directions of the prismatic joints are symmetric with respect to the plane containing 
the revolute axes [1, 13, 14]. 
                                            
 
Fig. 2  The Folded RPRP Linkage                                    Fig. 3  The Unfolded RPRP Linkage 
 
Following Delassus’ criteria for the RPRP linkage, we can obtain two types of RPRP linkages, 
in folded and unfolded forms, which differ from each other in the twist angles. Figures 2 and 3 show 
the construction of these two types of linkages by using different hexahedrons. In what follows, we 
describe the geometric constraints of both types of linkages and derive their loop closure equations. 
In an RPRP linkage, the variables are the joint angles of the revolute joints, 1θ  and 3θ , and the 
translational distances of the prismatic joints, 2r  and 4r . Since the mobility of the RPRP linkage is 
one, three scalar equations (the loop closure equations of the linkage) must be obtained. According 
to the mobility criteria of the linkage, the geometric constraints of the folded RPRP linkages can be 
obtained as follows: (offset distances) 4112 aa = , 3423 aa = , 2312 // aa , 4134 // aa ; (twist angles) 3412 αα = , 
4123 αα = , piαα =+ 2312 ; (translational distances) 031 == rr ; (joint angles) 042 == θθ . 
In order to obtain the loop closure equations, as shown in Figure 4, we observe the linkage from 
the direction of the revolute joint axes. From this top view of the folded RPRP linkage, we obtain 
the following three closure equations:

vector of any point on the line, and p is the pitch of the screw. Since the magnitude of the direction 
vector is immaterial, we can normalize the direction vector to obtain a unit screw. In this paper, we 
use the symbol ∧  above a boldface letter to denote a unit vector or a unit screw. 
When a set of screws are closed under addition and scalar multiplication, they form a screw 
system. A screw system of the nth order (an n-system) contains 1−∞n  screws and corresponds to a 
vector subspace of rank n. It is well known that the instantaneous motion of a rigid body with N 
DOF can be generally described by an N-system [15]. Finite displacement screws normally do not 
form screw systems. Parkin [16] unveiled a new definition of pitch for a finite displacement screw, 
in which pitch was the ratio of one-half the translation to the tangent of one-half the rotation. If 
Parkin’s definition of pitch is used, finite displacement screws can form screw systems. 
Nevertheless, unlike in instantaneous motion, the finite displacement of a rigid body with N DOF 
can be generally described by an (N+1)-system if the corresponding finite screw system exists. The 
statement is true if we exclude the case in which the finite motion is generated by a single kinematic 
joint. 
It has been demonstrated that the operations of vector subspaces can be employed in finite 
kinematic analysis of mechanisms [6, 9]; however, special attention should be paid because finite 
screw systems are in fact not vector subspaces. Instead, a finite screw system corresponds to the 
projective space associated with the vector subspace spanned by the basis screws of the screw 
system [17]. In a projective space, vectors that differ from one another only in magnitude are 
considered to be equivalent and are represented by a homogeneous vector.  
In addition to the theoretical importance of finite screw systems, one of the most attractive 
advantages is that kinematic analysis can be substantially simplified by using the vector subspace 
operations of screw systems. For example, the coupler motion of the Bennett mechanism is 
compatible to both RR dyads forming the mechanism and is obtained by the intersection of vector 
subspaces corresponding to the RR dyads [6]. The application of intersections of screw systems in 
instantaneous kinematics is well known; however, the concept of employing the intersection of 
finite screw systems in finite kinematic analysis is relatively new. 
Since finite screw systems correspond to projective spaces, the intersection of finite screw 
systems becomes that of projective spaces. The following proposition allows us to conduct the 
intersection: the projective space associated with the intersection of some vector subspaces of a 
vector space is the intersection of the projectivizations of these subspaces [18-20]. For example, to 
study the finite motion of one link of the RPRP linkage (the coupler link) with respect to its 
opposite link (the ground link), the finite motion of the coupler of the RPRP linkage must be

As a result, PRS  belongs to a 3-system, of which RS , PS , and RP SS ×  are a set of basis screws. Here 
RP SS ×  denotes the screw product [22-24] of PS  and RS . Note that the magnitude (intensity) of the 
screw PRS , obtained from the equation above, is irrelevant, and we are only concerned with its unit 
screw. In terms of linear algebra, PRS  belongs to the projective space associated with the vector 
subspace spanned by RS , PS , and RP SS × .

Similarly, for an RP dyad, as shown in Figure 7, the resultant finite displacement screw RPS  can 
be obtained by: 
  26 
Similarly, all possible finite displacement screws of the RP dyad belong to a 3-system, of which 
1S , 4S , and 41 SS × are a set of basis screws, where

Then the intersection of the two finite 3-systesms associated with the PR and RP dyads is 
calculated by employing the intersection operation of vector subspaces [6, 18-20]. The intersection 
is a 2-system, of which a set of basis screws are obtained as follows:

These two basis screws are illustrated in Figure 9. They are both parallel to the Z-axis. It can be 
shown that the screw system is of the fourth special 2-system [15]. 
 
2.7  The Intersection of Screw Systems for the Unfolded RPRP Linkage 
Figure 10 shows the schematic drawing of an unfolded RPRP linkage. The coordinate system is 
set up in a fashion similar to that for the folded linkage. The screw coordinates of the joints are the 
same as those for the folded linkage except for:

Let link 12 be the fixed link. We are concerned with the finite displacement of link 34 with respect 
to link 12. The displacement of link 34 must be compatible with the dyad formed by joints 2 and 3 
(the PR dyad) and that formed by joints 4 and 1 (the RP dyad). According to the previous 
discussions, all possible finite displacement screws of dyad PR belong to a 3-system, of which 2S , 
3S , and 32 SS × are a set of basis screws, where

The rank of the above matrix is two, which indicates that all the displacement screws belong to a 2-
system. These screws are illustrated in Figure 11. The lengths of the screws shown in the figure are 
proportional to the magnitudes of the pitches. It can be seen that these screws are parallel and 
coplanar, and that the pitches vary linearly. This supports that the screw system is of the fourth 
special 2-system.

This paper investigated the finite motion of the spatial RPRP linkage and unveiled a novel finite 
screw system. The screw surface of the coupler link of the RPRP linkage was shown to be a screw 
system of the second order. We began with the construction of two types of RPRP linkages, in 
folded and unfolded forms, based on Delassus’ criteria. The two types of linkages were 
distinguished by using different hexahedron constructions. Then the screw surface of the RPRP 
linkage was obtained by the intersection of the screw systems corresponding to RP and PR dyads. 
As a result, the screw surface was represented as a screw system of the second order. The screw 
system was of the fourth special 2-system, of which all screws are coplanar. This paper 
demonstrates the finite kinematic analysis of the RPRP linkage in the context of linear algebra. In 
addition to its theoretical importance in kinematic geometry, the novel finite screw system unveiled 
in this paper simplifies the analysis and synthesis of the linkage.
