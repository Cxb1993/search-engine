英文摘要: MIMO signal processing techniques have been regarded as the most promising 
technology for increasing transmission rate and system capacity. Leveraging MIMO techniques in 
establishing wireless peer-to-peer communications in heterogeneous networking environments is 
one of the major tasks in future 4G and beyond 4G communication systems. Such systems require 
high spectrum efficiency, dynamic spectrum access and management, and ensured data security. 
These goals can be fulfilled by incorporating advanced baseband signal processing techniques and 
MAC protocols for distributed and cooperative systems, and cognitive transceivers into the future 
wireless communication systems. This overall project includes the following 6 subprojects for 
advanced MIMO technologies for distributed and cooperative MIMO systems, cognitive radio 
systems and low power baseband processor design and system optimization.  
 
I. Physical Layer Security and Secrecy via Distributed Beamforming in 
Cooperative Networks  
Distributed beamforming is a specific cooperative transmission scheme where the relays utilize 
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) to construct phase coherent transmission 
towards the destination or destinations. Most techniques proposed in the literature assume that all 
nodes in the network are trustworthy or are fully compliant with the relay rules. However, in 
practice, the existence of greedy or malicious relays may significantly destruct the beamforming 
transmission. One of the main objectives of this project is to devise strategies to identify the 
malicious relays and utilize intelligent feedback control to mitigate the effect of the malicious 
attacks. Moreover, while most studies on distributed beamforming focus on maximizing the array 
gain at the destination, we consider the innovative application that exploits the relays ability to 
construct spatial nulls and/or artificial noise to enhance physical-layer secrecy and to achieve 
interference avoidance in cognitive networks. The notion of physical-layer secrecy refers to the 
framework on wiretap channels first proposed by Wyner that studies the capacity towards 
legitimate users subject to constraints on the information rate attainable by eavesdroppers. The 
distributed nature of the relays and physical limitations of the feedback control channel poses 
great challenges on the design of distributed beamforming strategies, which will be carefully 
addressed in this three year project.  
 
II. Noncoherent Detection, Channel Estimation, and Beamforming for 
Distributed MIMO-OFDM Communications in Fast Block Fading Channels 
Accurate channel estimation is indispensable to fully harvest the improved capacity and diversity 
advantages in (distributed) MIMO systems. In view of spectrum efficiency loss of existing 
training based channel estimation methods especially in fast mobile scenarios, blind or semiblind

with the primary user at the expense of giving up using this protected band. In this project, we 
seek the possibility that the secondary user could still utilize the protected band for its data 
transmission under the constraint of not interfering with the primary user. The power spectrum in 
the protected band is suppressed with respect to the primary user. The primary user would hardly 
notice the existence of the secondary user interferences. Therefore, we call this system the stealth 
cognitive radio. We plan to develop the stealth cognitive radio concept based on different types of 
information from perfect channel state information (CSI), to imperfect CSI, and primary user’s 
direction of arrival (DOA). Difference types of optimization approaches such as least square (LS), 
minimum mean square error (MMSE) and convex optimization method are considered to obtain 
spectrum notch at the protected band. We will begin with butterfly interference network with 
single secondary user and one primary user. Then we plan to extend the solution to dynamic 
spectrum access for multiple primary users for stealth cognitive radio.  
 
V. Design and Implementation of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Processor for 
OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio  
In the next generation wireless communication, the scarce spectrum resource and the requirement 
of high transmission capacity become important issues. Distributed cooperative communication 
and cognitive radio system are two main emerging techniques for these problems. This project 
aims to develop the cooperative spectrum sensing technique for the OFDM-based Cognitive Radio 
System. We will investigate the characteristics of the OFDM spectrum and develop reliable 
low-cost spectrum sensing architecture, DSP algorithm, hardware architecture, and its realization. 
The target of the project is to reduce the computational complexity in the current cooperative 
spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio so that it can be possible to be realized in the 
practical system. Furthermore, we will design and implement the digital signal processor IC 
circuit for the cooperative spectrum in terms of the low-cost and low-power considerations. 
Finally, we will integrate this spectrum sensing circuit in the system plate-form in sub-project VI 
for verification.  
 
VI. Closed-Loop SU-/MU-MIMO Communications: System Design and SOC 
Platform Implementation  
Open loop MIMO techniques have been studied and implemented successfully into current 
communications. Maximum likelihood (ML) is the well-known optimal solution and the Sphere 
Decoder is the promising candidate for the implementation. However, the performance is not 
satisfactory enough and high complexity in mobile stations is not good for low power solutions. 
Therefore, closed-loop MIMO techniques with channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) 
and pre-coder can provide even higher performance and reduce complexity in mobile station. To 
obtain more spectrum efficiency, higher order MIMO techniques are adopted in modern 
communications. However, it is not feasible to put too many antennas in mobile stations

II. 用於快速塊狀衰減通道中分散式多輸入多輸出-正交分頻多工通訊系統之非
相干偵測、通道估計與波束成形  
在 (分散式) 多輸入多輸出系統中，精確的通道估計是為完全獲取增進之容量及分集增益不
可或缺的要素。有鑿於以訓練訊號的通道估計技術在快速行動環境中會造成頻譜效益的損失，
盲蔽及半盲蔽的通道估計技術及非相干之偵測技術能夠在頻譜效益及系統性能上取得較好
的妥協。本子計畫專注於針對分散式多輸入多輸出-正交分頻多工 (MIMO-OFDM)系統發展
有效之非相干偵測、盲蔽/半盲蔽的通道估計及波束成形技術。特別是針對快速塊狀衰減通
道 (fast block fading channels)，我們將發展在多用戶 OFDM 系統、垂直正交空時編碼
OFDM(OSTBC-OFDM)系統及分散式 OSTBC-OFDM 系統中的逐一區塊地 (block-by-block) 
訊號處理技術包括波束成形、非相干最大似然偵測、通道估計等。利用凸面最佳化理論 
(convex optimization theory)，我們亦將發展針對高階 QAM 調變之 OSTBC 最大似然偵測的
有效近似方法。本子計畫也將研究諸如隨機空時編碼 (random space-time codes)、通道感知
隨機媒介擷取 (channel-aware random medium access) 等跨層 (cross-layered) 及更高層的通
訊協定技術以增進系統效能、容量及資料流量。 
 
III. 正交分碼多工感知無線電之頻譜偵聽、頻譜選擇與發送頻譜形塑 
針對頻譜稀有問題，一個前瞻性的解決辦法是動態搜尋閒置頻譜，並機會性地加以使用。感
知無線電 (cognitive radio) 技術是目前提倡的一種落實機會性頻譜共享的候選方案。本子計
畫中我們將研究正交分頻多工 (OFDM) 感知無線電系統。以下是我們訂定的三個主題： 
#1. 頻譜偵聽 (spectrum sensing)：在感知無線電系統中，感知使用者必須有能力偵測主要使
用者 (primary user) 的存在以及其使用的頻段，以避免對主要使用者造成干擾。 
#2. 頻譜選擇 (spectrum decision)：未使用的頻段通常散布在大範圍的頻率區域上。而感知
無線電需具有從眾多可用頻段中決定最佳者的能力。 
#3. 發送頻譜形塑 (transmit spectrum shaping)：為了避免干擾到主要系統，感知使用者必須
在主要使用者的頻段上中止傳輸或減低發送功率。假設主要系統佔用了感知無線電系統頻段
的一部份，我們希望感知使用者可以繼續運作，但必須調整其發射頻譜以致對主要系統的干
擾低於某一門檻值。 
 
IV. 隱匿式感知無線通訊之動態頻譜接取技術 
本計劃主要探討並設計感知無線電技術基頻通訊所特有的技術。一般所謂感知無線電技術，
是指secondary user 可以聰明地偵測哪一個通訊頻道正在被primary user 使用(稱之為
protected band)，然後自動地轉換到沒有被佔用的頻道，它在無線電中嵌入Detect and 
Avoidance (DAA)功能來避開已被佔用的頻道，並由此讓另外的頻道給沒有獲得授權的使用
者應用。傳統DAA 為基礎的感知無線電系統，secondary user 必須避開protected band 以免
干擾到primary user，我提出一個完全不一樣的構想，希望可以在不干擾primary user 的前提
下，同時secondary user 也可以利用victim band 來傳送訊息。因為不會干擾到primary user，
所以我們稱之為隱匿式感知無線通訊與之區別。我們計劃在不同的系統資訊假設下，由先而
後包括完全已知通道訊息、不完全知道通道訊息、或藉由primary user 訊息入射角，來發展

and but also have to recruit good international students and students from Mainland China for 
keeping our research competition, recognition and visibility in the world.

Talk 2: A Convex Analysis and Optimization Perspective to Unmixing of Hyperspectral 
Images  
Abstract: In hyperspectral remote sensing, unmixing a data cube into the spectral signatures of 
endmenbers and their corresponding abundance fractions plays a crucial role in analyzing the 
mineralogical composition of a solid surface. Such an unmixing problem has a lot in common with 
non-negative blind source separation problem. This talk describes a novel convex analysis and 
optimization perspective to hyperspectral unmixing. Our endeavor is not only motivated by the recent 
prevalence of convex optimization in signal processing, but also by the nature of hyperspectral 
unmixing (specifically, non-negativity and full additivity of abundances) that makes convex analysis 
a very suitable tool.  
By the notion of convex analysis, we formulate two optimization problems for solving 
hyperspectral unmixing, which have intuitive ideas (or beliefs without any rigorous analysis and 
proof) that “the endmembers are determined by vertices of the maximum volume simplex within all 
the observed pixels” proposed by Winter in late 1990, and that “the endmembers are determined by 
the vertices of a minimum volume simplex enclosing all the observed pixels” proposed by Craig in 
mid 1990, respectively. We show the relation between the two formulated optimization problems, by 
proving that their optimal solutions become identical and yield the true endmembers (i.e., the 
identifiability of the unknown mixing matrix) when there exist pure pixels. We also illustrate how the 
two problems can be efficiently solved by alternating linear programming, one referred to as 
alternating volume maximization (AVMAX) algorithm and the other as alternating volume 
minimization (AVMIN) algorithm. Monte Carlo simulation results with several data sets are 
presented to validate our analytical results, and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. 
The experimental results using the AVMIN algorithm for real hyperspectral image data collected by 
airbone visible/infrared imaging spectrometer flight over the Cuprite mining site, Nevada, in 1997, 
show a high agreement with the reported ground truth.

1. Introduction
Potential applications of non-negative blind source separation
(nBSS) problem:
analytical chemistry [Malinowski02],
hyperspectral imaging [Stein02],
biomedical imaging [Wang06].
Existing nBSS methods based on statistical assumptions:
nICA2 [Plumbley03], and BPSS3 [Moussaoui06].
usually assume uncorrelated or independent sources.
Such a fundamental statistical assumption of source
independence (or uncorrelatedness) may not always be true in
imaging analysis in general.

Distinctions between nLCA-IVM, nLCA-ES and CAMNS
nLCA-IVM (a direct approach) to be presented is a convex analysis
based algorithm for the design of the demixing (or unmixing) matrix
(corresponding to the equalizer design in wireless communications), by
minimizing the joint correlation function of all the extracted (unmixed)
sources.
nLCA-ES (an indirect approach) [Wang06m] is an algorithm, searching for
all the edges of the observation-constructed convex cone (i.e., the scatter
plot of all the mixtures’ data points) for identifying the mixing matrix
(corresponding to the channel estimation in wireless communications),
and then the demixing matrix is obtained by matrix inversion.
CAMNS (an advanced direct approach) [Chan07] is a convex analysis
based approach by searching for all the extreme points of an
observation-constructed polyhedral set, neither involving the mixing
matrix identification nor the design of the demixing matrix.
Remark: nLCA-ES and CAMNS are non-iterative pure-source
sample criterion based algorithms.

2. Problem Formulation
Consider the M ×N linear mixing signal model
x[n] = As[n], n = 1, . . . , L, (1)
(i.e., sample-by-sample or pixel-by-pixel or point-by-point
representation) where
x[n] = [ x1[n], . . . , xM [n] ]T is the nth data point of the
given M mixtures (or observations),
A = [aij ] ∈ RM×N is an unknown mixing matrix,
s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T is the nth source point of N
sources,
L > max{M,N} is the data length (i.e., number of pixels of
each mixture).
7 / 51
Problem Formulation
Another form of (1) is the observation-by-observation
representation given by
xi =
N∑
j=1
aijsj , i = 1, 2, . . . ,M. (3)
Likewise from (2), we desire to find W ∈ RN×M such that
yi =
M∑
j=1
wijxj = sti , i = 1, 2, . . . , N, (4)
where ti ∈ {1, . . . , N}, ti 6= tj for i 6= j.

Assumptions
Relaxation of (A4): [Wang06m]
x¯[n] = D−11 x[n] = (D
−1
1 AD2)D
−1
2 s[n], (5)
where
D1 = diag{xT1 1L,xT2 1L, . . . ,xTM1L},
D2 = diag{sT1 1L, sT2 1L, . . . , sTN1L}.
By letting A¯ = D−11 AD2 and s¯[n] = D
−1
2 s[n], the resulting
normalized nBSS model
x¯[n] = A¯s¯[n]
will satisfy all the assumptions (A1)− (A4).

nLCA: Geometric Insights
Theorem 1
Suppose that (A2) and (A4) hold. Then
(a) conv{x1,x2, . . . ,xM} ⊆ conv{s1, s2, . . . , sN}, and
(b) sol{x1,x2, . . . ,xM} ⊆ sol{s1, s2, . . . , sN}.
Figure: Geometric illustration of Theorem 1 for M = N = 3.
13 / 51
nLCA: Geometric Insights
Under the fact that xi ∈ conv{s1, s2} for i = 1, 2, one can easily
infer that minimizing ρ(x1,x2) is equivalent to maximizing the
“area” of the triangle formed by the origin, x1 and x2.
Question: How to define the joint correlation function of
x1, . . . ,xM when M > 2?
15 / 51
nLCA: nBSS problem
Corollary 1
Suppose that (A2) and (A4) hold. Then
corr(s1, s2, . . . , sN ) ≤ corr(x1,x2, . . . ,xM ).
Corollary 1 motivates the idea of designing the demixing
matrix W ∈ RN×M by minimizing the joint correlation
function of extracted sources y1, . . . ,yN , i.e.,
min
W
corr{y1,y2, . . . ,yN},
subject to (s.t.)
yi = ΣMj=1wijxj  0, ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , N, (due to (A1))
W1M =W(A1N ) = P1N = 1N . (due to (A4))
17 / 51
nLCA: IVM Algorithm (M = N)
Case of M = N :
By change of variables, the objective function of our nBSS
problem becomes [Lang83]
V (sol{y1,y2, . . . ,yN}) = |det(W)| · V (sol{x1,x2, . . . ,xN}).
Because V (sol{x1, . . . ,xN}) is a constant, our nBSS problem
is equivalent to
max
W
|det(W)|
s.t. W1N = 1N , ΣNj=1wijxj  0, ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , N,
(7)
which is a non-convex optimization problem with N linear
equality constraints and LN linear inequality constraints.
19 / 51
nLCA: IVM Algorithm (M = N)
Either of the two subproblems (8a) and (8b) is still non-convex.
To efficiently solve (8a) and (8b), we consider the cofactor expansion of
det(W) w.r.t. one row of W
det(W) =
N
X
j=1
(−1)i+jwijdet(Wij),
(which is a linear function of the ith row wTi of W) sinceWij (the
submatrix of W with the ith row and jth column removed) is a constant
matrix w.r.t. wTi .
Our approach is to update only one row wTi of W each time, while fixing
the other rows of W (i.e., det(Wij) are fixed for all j). The demixing
matrix W is then updated in a row-by-row manner for each iteration.
21 / 51
nLCA: IVM Algorithm Summary
(S1) Set a convergence tolerance δ > 0, i := 1, W := IN , and
υ := |det(W)|.
(S2) Solve the two LPs (9a) and (9a) to obtain the optimum
(p?, w¯i) and (q?, wˆi), respectively.
(S3) If |p?| > |q?|, then update wi := w¯i. Otherwise, update
wi := wˆi.
(S4) If (i modulo N) 6= 0, then set i := i+ 1 and go to (S2),
else
if |max{|p?|, |q?|} − υ|/υ < δ, then W? =W and stop,
Otherwise set υ := max{|p?|, |q?|}, i := 1, and go to (S2).
|det(W)| is guaranteed to increase maximally whenever a row of the
demixing matrix W is updated; the algorithm converges within one digit
of iterations by our experience. (One iteration means that all the N rows
of W are updated one time.)

Complexity Reduction: Elimination of Redundant
Inequality Constraints
The feasible set of either of (9a) and (9a) can also be expressed as
F = {w ∈ RN | wT1N = 1, wTx[n] ≥ 0, n = 1, 2, . . . , L},
= {w ∈ RN | wT1N = 1, wTv ≥ 0, v ∈ conv{x[1],x[2], . . . ,x[L]}},
where
conv{x[1],x[2], . . . ,x[L]} =
(
r
X
i=1
θix[li]



r
X
i=1
θi = 1, θi ≥ 0, ∀ i
)
in which x[l1], x[l2], . . ., x[lr] are the extreme points (vertices) of the convex
hull, and can be identified by using the quickhull algorithm [Barber1996]. Thus,
F = {w ∈ RN | wT1N = 1, wTx[li] ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , r}.
Therefore, L− r out of the L linear inequality constraints of (9a) and (9a) can
be removed since 0 < r ≤ L. The reduction ratio ∆ = (L− r)/L can usually
be higher than 0.9.

nLCA: Identifiability
Assumption (Existence of pure-source samples)
(A5) There exists at least one index set {l1, l2, . . . , lN} such that
s[li] = si[li]ei, i = 1, 2, . . . , N.
=⇒ x[li] = si[li]ai, and this assumption usually holds true in biomedical
imaging and hyperspectral imaging (in remote sensing) [Chan07],
[Wang06], [Stein02].
Theorem 2 (Source identifiability of nLCA)
Suppose that (A1) to (A5) hold. Then
W?A = P,
where W? is the optimal solution of problem (7).

X
i=1
aijsj + ηi, i = 1, 2, . . . ,M, (11)
where ηi = [ ηi[1], . . . , ηi[L] ]
T is the additive noise vector.
A matrix representation for (11) is
X = SAT +Ψ,
where
X = (x1, . . . ,xM ) ∈ RL×M observation matrix,
S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ RL×N source matrix,
Ψ = (η1, . . . ,ηM ) ∈ RL×M noise matrix.
29 / 51
Dimension and Noise Reduction by PCA
The PCA is to find the approximated observation matrix X? with
rank(X?) = N by minimizing
J = ‖X? −X‖2 =
M∑
i=1
‖x?i − xi‖2,
subject to rank(X?) = N , where each column of X? takes the
following linear form
x?i = µ+Vλi, i = 1, 2, . . . ,M,
in which µ is an L× 1 vector, V is an L× (N − 1) semi-unitary
matrix (i.e., VTV = IN−1) and λi are (N − 1)× 1 vectors.

6. Conclusions
The nLCA has been presented for nBSS by minimizing a joint
correlation function of multiple signals regardless of if sources are
statistically dependent or independent.
The nLCA is fulfilled by volume maximization of the solid region
constructed by separated sources using computationally efficient LP
(in conjunction with the quickhull algorithm), namely the
nLCA-IVM algorithm.
The condition achieving the source identifiability of the nLCA has
been proven to be the existence of at least one pure-source sample
for each source, i.e., Assumption (A5).
The proposed nLCA-IVM is insensitive to the existence of
pure-source samples because its principle neither relies on
pure-source samples nor involves search of data points associated
with pure-source samples.

1. Introduction to Hyperspectral Imaging
Hyperspectral imaging is a crucial technique for identification of
unknown materials characterized by their individual spectral
signatures. Hyperspectral sensor records solar EM scattering
patterns of distinct materials over hundreds of spectral bands (from
visible to near-infrared wavelength) over a solid surface.
Linear Mixing Model - A
hyperspectral sensor measures
solar EM radiation (reflectance)
through a single reflection from
the surface containing distinct
substances. Courtesy to N.

Applications include terrain classification, agricultural monitoring,
environmental monitoring, and military surveillance.

Hyperspectral Unmixing
Signal model: Due to low spatial resolution of the sensors used, each
observed pixel is a linear mixture of multiple distinct substance spectra:
x[n] = As[n] =
N∑
i=1
si[n]ai, n = 1, . . . , L (1)
where
x[n] = [ x1[n], . . . , xM [n] ]T is the nth observed pixel vector
comprising M spectral bands,
A = [ a1, . . . ,aN ] ∈ RM×N is the signature matrix where ai
denotes the ith endmember signature (i.e., MIMO channel in
wireless communications),
s[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN [n] ]T is the nth abundance vector
comprising N fractional abundances (i.e., information-bearing
signals transmitted through MIMO channel in wireless
communications).
6 / 62
Model Assumptions
(A1) (Non-negativity) Intensities of all the abundance vectors are
non-negative, i.e., si[n] ≥ 0 for all i and n.
(A2) min{L,M} ≥ N and the endmember signatures are linearly
independent, i.e., A is of full column rank.
(A3) (Full-additivity) Sum of all the abundance fractions is equal to
unity for each observed pixel, i.e.,
∑N
i=1 si[n] = 1 for all n.
(A4) (Pure pixel assumption) There exist N pure pixels x[`i] = ai
for i = 1, . . . , N (i.e., s[`i] = ei).
(A1), (A2) and (A3) are common assumptions, while (A4) is
a specific assumption on which many of endmember
estimation algorithms are based. None of them are statistical
assumptions.

Our Contributions
We provide a convex analysis and optimization perspective to
hyperspectral unmixing, motivated by the fact that such a
problem has a lot in common with the problem of nonnegative
BSS based on convex analysis, which is currently a novel and
interesting research in signal processing.
Two existing beliefs (without rigorous proof)
- Winter’s unmixing criterion - N-FINDR [Winter’99]
(assuming existence of pure pixels)
- Craig’s unmixing criterion - MVT [Craig’94]
(without involving pure pixels)
are used to formulate the hyperspectral unmixing into two
non-convex optimization problems, respectively.

3. Convex Analysis to Hyperspectral Unmixing Problems
Development of Hyperspectral Unmixing Algorithms:
16 / 62
Since x[n] ∈ A(C,d), its affine representation is
x[n] = Cx˜[n] + d ∈ RM . (2)
Then the dimension-reduced pixel x˜[n] is given by
x˜[n] = C†(x[n]− d) = CT (x[n]− d) ∈ RN−1.
since the matrix C is semi-unitary.
Lemma 2 (Simplex geometry)
Under (A1), (A2), and (A3), all the x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L] are confined in the
simplex conv{α1, . . . ,αN}, i.e.,
x˜[n] =
N∑
i=1
si[n]αi ∈ conv{α1, . . . ,αN} ⊂ RN−1, ∀n
(with the same form as the original signal model for x[n]) where
αi = C†(ai − d) ∈ RN−1
is the ith dimension-reduced (or affinely transformed) endmember.
18 / 62
B. Optimization Problems & Algorithms
Two beliefs (without rigorous analysis and proof thus far) for
hyperspectral unmixing can be adopted:
Unmixing Criteria from Winter’s and Craig’s works
Winter’s unmixing criterion [Winter’99]:
Assuming the presence of pure pixels, the N
dimension-reduced endmembers (αi) are determined to be the
N vertices of the maximum-volume simplex inside the data
cloud {x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]}; say, conv{ν1, . . . ,νN}.
Craig’s unmixing criterion [Craig’94]:
The N dimension-reduced endmembers (αi) are determined
to be the N vertices of the minimum-volume simplex
enclosing all the data x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]; say, conv{β1, . . . ,βN}.
20 / 62
Problem Formulation by Winter’s Criterion
Let
V (ν1, . . . ,νN ) = |det(∆(ν1, . . . ,νN ))| /(N − 1)!
which is known to be the volume of conv{ν1, . . . ,νN} ⊂ RN−1
[Strang06], where
∆(ν1, . . . ,νN ) =
[
ν1 · · · νN
1 · · · 1
]
∈ RN×N .
Based on the belief of Winter’s unmixing criterion, we have
Maximum volume simplex fitting problem
max
ν1,...,νN∈RN−1
V (ν1, . . . ,νN )
s.t. νi ∈ conv{x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L]}, ∀ i.
(3)
22 / 62
The cofactor expansion of ∆(ν1, . . . ,νN ) along the jth
column (for any j) is given by
det(∆(ν1, . . . ,νN )) = bTj νj + (−1)N+jdet(VNj),
where V ij ∈ R(N−1)×(N−1) is a submatrix of ∆(ν1, . . . ,νN )
with the ith row and jth column removed, and
bj = [(−1)i+jdet(V ij)]N−1i=1 ∈ RN−1.
det(∆(ν1, . . . ,νN )) is affine in each νj since V ij are
constant w.r.t. νj for all i.
24 / 62
The optimal solution of (4p), denoted by αˆj , is the optimal
solution of (4p+) if |p?| > |q?|, and the optimal solution of
(4p−) if |q?| > |p?|.
This partial maximization (or two LPs) is conducted cyclically
(i.e., j := (j modulo N) + 1) until some stopping rule is
satisfied.
Such an approach is called alternating volume maximization
(AVMAX), which is actually an endmember estimation
algorithm.
To initialize the AVMAX, one can find some feasible
ν1, . . . ,νN by randomly selecting any N dimension-reduced
pixels from x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L].
26 / 62
Step 6. Obtain endmember estimates aˆj = Cν?j + d for j = 1, . . . , N .
Step 7. Estimate the abundance vectors sˆ[n] by FCLS [Heinz’01] with
the given ν?1 , . . . ,ν
?
N and x˜[1], . . . , x˜[L].
The LPs [(4p) and (4p+)] can be solved effectively by
interior-point algorithms, with a worst-case complexity of
O(L0.5(2LN +N3)) ' O(NL1.5) if L N [Lustig’94].
The AVMAX algorithm involves 2N LPs per iteration,
implying that its worst-case computational complexity order is
O(N2L1.5) per iteration. After estimation of the N
endmembers, the abundance vectors are estimated (based on
the linear mixture model for x˜[n] given in Lemma 2) by using
FCLS [Heinz’01] (Step 7).
28 / 62
Alternating LP Approach to Volume Minimization
The objective function of (5): The simplex volume
V (β1, . . . ,βN ) is given by [Strang’06]
V (β1, . . . ,βN ) = |det(B)|/(N − 1)!,
(non-convex) where
B = [ β1 − βN , . . . ,βN−1 − βN ] ∈ R(N−1)×(N−1). (6)
The constraint of (5): An alternative expression (by Lemma 2) is
given by
x˜[n] =
N∑
i=1
si[n]βi = βN +Bs′[n],
where
s′[n] = [ s1[n], . . . , sN−1[n] ]T  0,
sN [n] = 1− 1TN−1s′[n] ≥ 0.
30 / 62
The cofactor expansion of det(H) along the ith row (for any
i) is given by
det(H) =
N−1∑
j=1
(−1)i+jhijdet(Hij),
where hij is the (i, j)th entry of H, and Hij ∈ R(N−2)×(N−2)
is a submatrix of H with the ith row and jth column
removed.
det(H) is a linear function of hij , j = 1, . . . , (N − 1).
Again, we consider problem (8) by
updating the ith row of H and ith entry of g (denoted by hTi and
gi respectively), while fixing other rows of H and other entries of g.
32 / 62
The optimal solution of (7p), denoted by ((hTi )
?, g?i ), is chosen as
that of (7p+) if |p?| > |q?|, and that of (7p−) if |q?| > |p?|.
This row-wise maximization is conducted cyclically (i.e., i := (i
modulo (N − 1)) + 1 at each iteration) until some stopping rule is
satisfied.
Suppose that a solution (H?,g?) is obtained.
The endmembers can be recovered by âi = Cα̂i + d by (2) for
i = 1, . . . , N , where
α̂N = (H?)−1g?, (by (7))
[α̂1, ..., α̂N−1] = α̂N1TN−1 + (H
?)−1. (by (7) and (6))
The abundance vectors can be estimated as
ŝ[n] = [ s′[n]T 1− 1TN−1s′[n] ]T ,
= [ (H?x˜[n]− g?)T 1− 1TN−1(H?x˜[n]− g?) ]T (by (7))
for all n = 1, ..., L.

Pseudo-code of the AVMIN method
Given A convergence tolerance ε > 0, an endmember affine set
characterization (C,d), the dimension-reduced pixels x˜[n] for
all n, and the number of endmembers N .
Step 1. Set i := 1 and % := |det(H)|. Obtain a feasible initial (H,g) by
solving the LP feasibility problem in (9).
Step 2. Solve the LPs (7p+) and (7p−), and obtain their optimal
solutions, denoted by (h¯Ti , g¯i) and (h
T
i , gi), respectively.
Step 3. If |p?| > |q?|, then update (hTi , gi) := (h¯Ti , g¯i). Otherwise,
update (hTi , gi) := (h
T
i , gi).
Step 4. If (i modulo (N − 1)) 6= 0, then i := i+ 1, and goto Step 2,
else
If |max{|p?|, |q?|} − %|/% < ε, then H? = H and g? = g.
Otherwise, set % := max{|p?|, |q?|}, i := 1, and goto Step 2.

Relation between Winter’s and Craig’s Unmixing Criteria
The optimal endmember simplex obtained by AVMAX is a
subset of that obtained by AVMIN.
By Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we can conclude that
Corollary 1
Suppose that (A1)− (A4) hold. Then, both of problems (3) and
(5) yield the same α1, . . . ,αN , thereby leading to the same N
true endmembers ai = Cαi + d.

Performance Comparison
The proposed AVMAX and AVMIN were tested together with
seven existing algorithms, N-FINDR, PPI, VCA, APS,
MVC-NMF, MVSA, and ICE for performance comparison.
Since PPI, N-FINDR, and VCA are endmember extraction
algorithms, the FCLS was used to find the associated
abundances. Hence, we termed them as N-FINDR-FCLS,
PPI-FCLS, and VCA-FCLS, respectively.

Simulations for Data with Various Purity Levels
Six endmembers (N = 6) from USGS library were selected.
We generated seven data sets with different purity levels
ρ = 0.7, 0.75, . . . , 1 for performance evaluation.
Purity level
A data set with purity level ρ denotes a set of L observed pixels
with all the purities ρ1, . . . , ρL in the range [ρ− 0.1, ρ], where
1√
N
≤ ρn = ‖s[n]‖ ≤ 1 (pixel purity)
is a purity measure for an observed pixel x[n] (=
∑N
i=1 si[n]ai).
The closer to unity the value of ρn, the more a single endmember
ai dominates in x[n].
=⇒ The generated data for ρ = 1 includes highly pure pixels.

Simulations for Various SNRs
The noise-free data were generated in the same manner as
above (N = 6, M = 417 and L = 1000).
The noisy data were generated by adding independently and
identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise to the
noise-free data x[n] for different values of SNR, where
SNR =
∑L
n=1 ‖x[n]‖2
σ2ML
in which σ2 is the noise variance.
SNR = 20, 25, . . .,40 dB and purity level ρ=0.7, 0.85, 1.

Comparison of Computation Load of Various Unmixing Methods
As expected, the performance of N-FINDR-FCLS follows that
of AVMAX closely due to the same unmixing criterion used.
The performance of MVSA is competing with that of AVMIN
besides smaller computational load, but the former may not
work for large data size (i.e., large L) (due to memory
problem).
The average computation time per realization (in secs) of
each algorithm executed in a desktop computer
- implemented in Matlab version 7.0
- equipped with Pentium 4 CPU 3.03GHz and 4GB RAM,
was used as our computational complexity measure.

The estimated number of endmembers is N = 14 by virtual
dimensionality (VD) [Chang’04].
We visually compared the abundance maps estimated by the
three methods with the ground truth [Swayze’92] to
determine the mineral class of the abundance map and the
associated endmember.
The mean-removed spectral angle between each
mineral-identified endmember estimate â and its
corresponding spectral signature a in the USGS library was
used as a performance index, i.e.,
φ = arccos
(
(â−m(â))T (a−m(a))
‖â−m(â)‖ ‖a−m(a)‖
)
,
where m(a) = (1TMa/M)1M for any vector a ∈ RM .

6. Conclusions
We have provided a convex analysis and optimization
perspective to hyperspectral unmixing, by formulating it into a
convex analysis based non-negative BSS problem.
We have proven the equivalence of Winter’s and Craig’s
unmixing criteria under the pure-pixel assumption [(A4)]
through convex analysis.
We have also developed AVMAX and AVMIN unmixing
algorithms using alternating linear programming to fulfill
Winter’s and Craig’s unmixing criteria, respectively. Further
computational load reduction and real data tests for large
scenes (large data size) are currently under investigation.
