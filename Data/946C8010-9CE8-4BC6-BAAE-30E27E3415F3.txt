Because the quantum tracking control is in the micro-scale world, the effects of the internal 
uncertainties and external disturbances become very important. At the same time, the modeling 
error and uncertainty of initial state will influence the tracking control significantly. However, the 
state of quantum is unavailable. Therefore, an observer-based tracking controller is needed. In 
this situation, robust HM observer-based control will be a very important design topic. Based on 
the observer, the tracking control problem becomes a min-max design problem, which needs to 
solve a dynamic Nash game. In order to solve the nonlinear Nash dynamic game problem, we 
need to solve a nonlinear partial differential Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). Because it is 
difficult to solve the HIE, we use the tensor power series to approximate this nonlinear dynamic 
game problem. At present, the HM observer-based controller is developed in this project. A 
simulation to validate the availability of the controller is given in this report. In this simulation, 
the performance is very satisfactory. In the future, we will improve the observer-based tracking 
control performance and develop other control methods based on this observer.

The quantum control problem in terms of optimal control theory has focused on the optimal 
steering from an initial state to a desired state by solving the two-point boundary problem via the 
Lagrange-multiplier technique [1-4]. However, the drawback of these optimal controls for 
quantum systems is that they are sensitive to modeling errors, perturbation in the system’s 
Hamiltonian, uncertainty in the initial state of the quantum system and external disturbances from 
the environment. Robustness to these uncertainties must be addressed if quantum control designs 
are to be implemented for practical applications. Recently, robust control has been widely applied 
to treat the attenuation problem of external disturbances [5, 9-11]. Therefore, it will be employed 
to treat the robust tracking problem of quantum systems under system uncertainties and external 
disturbances. 
  In this study, based on the state space dynamic model, a robust output feedback tracking 
design for quantum systems is proposed so that the effects of uncertainties due to modeling errors, 
the initial state of the system and external disturbances, on the tracking error should be below a 
desired level, i.e., the gain from these uncertainties to the tracking error of a quantum system 
should be less than a prescribed value for some control purpose. The robust output feedback 
tracking control design is employed to attenuate the effect of uncertainties or disturbances to 
achieve a less sensitive tracking control in the quantum systems. In order to achieve the control 
design purpose with uncertainty attenuation and disturbance rejection in quantum tracking 
systems, we need to solve a min-max tracking problem with the worst-case (maximum) effect of 
disturbances on the tracking performance to be minimized. It will be shown that our robust output 
feedback quantum tracking problem is equivalent to a min-max (game) control problem, which 
needs to solve a Bellman-Isaacs equation from the dynamic game perspective [7]. 
Therefore, the robust tracking control problem in quantum systems becomes the problem of 
how to solve an HJE. However, it is generally not easy to solve this nonlinear partial differential 
HJE. For the convenience of design, a tensor formal power series method is employed to solve 
the HJE. Because the tensor formal power series converges quickly, it could approximate the 
robust tracking design satisfactorily with only the first few terms. In the open loop control case, 
the quantum control is obtained by a computational feedback simulation as shown in Fig. 1. The 
feedback system simulated by a computer, within which there are a model to represent the 
quantum mechanical system and a control law, enforces the control with an open loop on the 
actual quantum mechanical system [1, 2]. The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 1. Tracking 
control signal ( )u t  is generated by the controller using the information on tracking error to 
make the state ( )x t  of a quantum system track a desired state ( )dx t  robustly. In [3], quantum 
systems are observed. However, the paper did not deal with measurements on the system and as 
such there was no feedback present in it. In the closed loop feedback control case, the systemic 
block diagram of the output feedback H
∞
 tracking control of quantum system is showed in Fig. 
2, and a continuous quantum measurement [12] is needed for output feedback control as shown in 
Fig. 3. The spin interacts with an optical mode, which is measured continuously by homodyne 
detection. With this measurement, a magnetic field is used for feedback control to steer the state

Consider the perturbative quantum system with dimension n  in (1). Since the quantum 
system is defined in the complex space, for the convenience of control design, it should be

Robust Reference Tracking Control Design for Nonlinear Distributed
Parameter Systems: Fuzzy Approach
Yu-Te Chang and Bor-Sen Chen*, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract— This paper addresses a robust reference tracking
control problem for nonlinear distributed parameter systems
with external disturbances and measurement noises. An infinite-
dimensional fuzzy state-space model is introduced to represent
the nonlinear distributed parameter system. This fuzzy state-
space model was separated into a finite-dimensional fuzzy state-
space controlled subsystem with an infinite-dimensional fuzzy
state-space residual subsystem. A finite-dimensional robust
fuzzy observer-based reference tracking controller is proposed
to control the nonlinear distributed parameter system to track
a desired reference trajectory based on the finite-dimensional
fuzzy state-space controlled subsystem. Finally, the criterion for
the robust tracking control design is proven via the dissipative
theory approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
Most physical systems are inherently distributed in space
and time, e.g. chemical engineering [1], biodynamics [2]–[4],
mechanical systems related with heat flows, fluid flow, elastic
wave, or flexible structure [5], [6]. In the past, the most
of system models were described by ordinary differential
equation (ODE) in order to simplify and systematically
solve the control design problem. However, the ordinary
differential equation is only considered in the time evolution.
It is not sufficient to model the physical systems included the
variation dependent on the space. Therefore, the distributed
parameter system (DPS), which is described by partial differ-
ential equation (PDE), is more suitable to model the spatio-
temporal dynamic systems.
In general, the tasks of control systems can be divided into
two categories: stabilization and tracking. The stabilization
problem is to design a controller so that the states of the
closed-loop system converge to an equilibrium point. In
model reference tracking problem, a controller is designed
to guarantee that the output of closed-loop system can track
a desired reference trajectory. For the reference tracking
problem of the distributed parameter system, there is only
studied in the linear case [7]. The authors in [7] proposed
an extended output regulation method to control the LDPS
to track a reference model. For the nonlinear case, to the
best of our knowledge, because of the complex nonlinearity
no result is proposed. However, in practical application, the
tracking control design is more important. In this situation,
the tracking control design of nonlinear distributed parameter
systems (NDPSs) is important. Therefore, a tracking control
design problem for NDPSs is studied in this paper.

In [8], Tseng et al. study a robust tracking problem for a
nonlinear system via the fuzzy tracking control scheme. A
tracking problem of uncertain T-S fuzy model with external
difturbances is studied in [9]. A T-S fuzzy model is used
to represent a nonlinear ODE system at first. Then, a fuzzy
observer-based controller is developed to reduce the tracking
error as small as possible via the H∞ tracking performance.
In this study, a robust tracking control scheme for nonlinear
distributed parameter systems is proposed based on the fuzzy
observer-based controller in [10]. A brief statement is intro-
duced in the following. A fuzzy distributed parameter system
proposed by Chen and Chang [10] to approximate the NDPS
through interpolating several linear distributed parameter
systems is introduced at first. A robust fuzzy observer-based
tracking control scheme is proposed to control the nonlinear
distributed parameter system to track a reference model and
at the same time to attenuate the effects of the coupled
residual subsystem, the approximation errors, the measure-
ment noises, and the external disturbances. In the design
procedure, the residual subsystem is treated as a uncertain
parts because of the characteristic of the infinite dimension.
Because of the coupling between the controlled subsystems
and the residual subsystems through controlled spillover and
observer spillover, more effort is needed for a systematic
robust reference tracking control design of NDPSs than the
conventional nonlinear systems. Based on dissipative theory
[11], [12], the observer-based fuzzy tracking controller is
proved that the nonlinear distributed parameter system can
robustly track a reference model by efficiently eliminating
the effect of the residual modes, the approximation error,
the measurement noises, and external disturbances.
The main contribution of this paper is as follows. The diffi-
culty of the reference tracking control design for a nonlinear
distributed parameter was overcome in this paper. A fuzzy
observer-based tracking controller is successfully developed
to control the nonlinear distributed parameter systems to
track a desired reference model. This robust tracking control
scheme can be systematically designed through fuzzy output
feedback tracking controller.

FORMULATION FOR NONLINEAR PARAMETER
DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
In this section, the reference tracking control problems for
the nonlinear distributed parameter system are formulated.
For the most of cases, the nonlinear distributed parameter
system can be governed by nonlinear reaction-diffusion
equation [13]. The external disturbances and measurement

represent the fuzzy distributed parameter system in (7) as
follows [10]

µi(zj(t)) [Aijy(t) +Bu(t) +Bdd(t)]
+ ε(y(t)) (12)
z(t) =Cy(t) +Dnn(t) (13)
where the vector y(t) is denoted as y(t) = [y1(t), . . . , y∞]T ;
λl is the eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenfunction
φl(x); a˜jkl is defined as a˜jkl =
∫ L
0 βj(x)φk(x)φl(x)dx; the
vector ε(y(t)) = [ε1(y(t)), . . . , ε∞(y(t))]. The correspond-
ing matrices are defined in [10].
In Theorem 1, the bound of approximate error ε(y(x, t))
could be proved to be less than a constant σ. The following
lemma is to prove that the approximate error ε(y(x, t)) has a
same bound with infinite-dimensional-expression approxima-
tion error ε(y(t)). The bound for approximate error ε(y(t))
in infinite-dimensional expression could be obtained by the
following theorem.
Theorem 2 (Error estimation [10]): If the bound of
ε(y(x, t)) is provided as follows
‖ε(y(x, t))‖L2([0,L];R) ≤ σ‖y(x, t)‖L2([0,L];R), (14)
then the bound of ε(y(t)) in infinite-dimensional expression
could also be estimated as follows
‖ε(y(t))‖ ≤ σ‖y(t)‖, (15)
where the vector ε(y(t)) = [ε1(y(t)), . . . , ε∞(y(t))]T .
Since the actuators cannot be excited to the highest
frequency modes [5], [6], [15], only sufficiently large
but finite N modes will be actively controlled. There-
fore, based on the eigenspectrum of spatial differential
operators, an infinite-dimensional fuzzy state-space model
in (12) can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional slow
mode to be controlled and an infinite-dimensional fast
residual mode to be tolerated. We define the controlled
mode state vector yc(t) and the residual mode state vector
yr(t) as follows yc(t) = [y1(t), y2(t), · · · , yN (t)]T and
yr(t) = [yN+1(t), yN+2, · · · , y∞(t)]
T
. Then, the infinite-
dimensional fuzzy state space system in (12)–(13) is sepa-
rated into a finite-dimensional controlled subsystem C and
an infinite-dimensional residual subsystem R as follows
C :

where w1(t) is an output of the controlled subsystem C
and it can affect the residual subsystem R; w2(t) is an
output of the residual subsystem R which can affect the
controlled subsystem C. The block diagram of two coupled
subsystems is shown in Fig. 1. And the matrices Ac,ij , Acr,ij ,
Arc,ij , Ar,ij , Bc, Br, εc(yc(t), yr(t)) and εr(yc(t), yr(t))
have some relationships with Aij , B and ε(y(t)) as follows

respectively. The output equation in (13) can be represented
as
z(t) = zc(t) + zr(t) = Ccyc(t) + Cryr(t) +Dnn(t) (18)
where Cc and Cr are related to C as C = [Cc Cr]. Note
that the residual parameters Ar,ij , Arc,ij , Acr,ij , Br, Brd,
and Cr are of infinite-dimension. The sensor outputs z(t)
in (18) are contaminated by the residual modes through the
term Cryr(t), which is called the observation spillover, and
the feedback control excites the residual modes through the
term Bru(t), which is called the controlled spillover [5], [6].
Because the controlled spillover and observation spillover
affect the stability of the overall system [6], the design of the
controller must to tolerate the spillover effects. Therefore, the
tracking control design is more difficult than the conventional
control system.
In the rest of this section, a relationship between the ap-
proximation error ε(y(t)) and its components εc(yc(t), yr(t))
and εr(yc(t), yr(t)) will be shown. Therefore, the following
corollary is an extension of Theorem 2.
Corollary 3 ( [10]): Suppose the approximation errors
εc(yc(t), yr(t)) and εr(yc(t), yr(t)) are bounded as follows
‖εc(yc(t), yr(t))‖ ≤ σ‖yc(t)‖
‖εr(yc(t), yr(t))‖ ≤ σ‖yr(t)‖
(19)
respectively, then we have ‖ε(y(t))‖ ≤ σ‖y(t)‖.

2) For the residual subsystem ∆d, the dissipation inequal-
ity in (26) holds, i.e., γ2 and ρ2 are finite.
Remark 1: Since all eigenvalues λi,l of Ai are ordered
so that Re{λi,l+1} ≤ Re{λi,l}, e.g. λi,l = −κi(lpi)2, we
can choose an appropriate dimension N for the controlled
subsystem to include all unstable modes. Then, the residual
subsystem is a collection of stable modes. Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume the residual subsystem ∆ without any
input is asymptotically stable.
The following lemma is provided for the proof of the
theorem.

where Σ , diag(2σ2I, 0, 0), for i = 1, . . . ,M . Then the
H∞ tracking control performance in (25) is guaranteed for a
prescribed disturbance attenuation level ρ2 by the observer-
based fuzzy controller in (20)–(21). In other words, for the
NDPS in (1), the effects of the external disturbances d(t)
and the measurement noise n(t) on the tracking error ze(t)
are attenuated by the H∞ tracking performance in (25).
Proof: Choose the storage function for the controlled
system Σd in (22) as V1(y¯c(t)) = y¯c(t)TP y¯c(t). By differ-
entiating the storage function, we can get

where V (y¯c(t), yr(t)) , V1(y¯c(t)) + η2V2(yr(t)). Since the
scalar η satisfies γ1 < η < 1γ2 , we have the inequalities
η2γ22 − 1 < 0 and γ21 − η2 < 0. Note that the above two
inequalities imply γ1 · γ2 < 1. Let the two inequalities, 2−
η2 < 0 and ρ21 + η2ρ22 < ρ2, hold, then the H∞ tracking
control performance inequality in (25) could be obtained.
Therefore, if the inequalities in (27)–(28) hold, then the H∞
tracking control performance in (25) could be guaranteed.
The H∞ tracking control design problem is to specify
the observer gains Gij and the control gains Kij and Fij
to satisfy the inequalities in (27)–(28). Finally, the optimal
H∞ tracking control design problem for nonlinear partial
differential system (1)–(2) could be solved by the following
constrained optimization problem

which is called an eigenvalue problem (EVP) [16].
