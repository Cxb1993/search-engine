 1. Abstract  
 
This report presents the results of our studies on prosodic modeling for Mandarin speech 
and the use of prosodic information in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In prosodic 
modeling, we first propose a statistical pitch contour model to consider some major affecting 
factors, and then extend the model to further incorporate with the inter-syllable coarticulation 
and syntactic information. In the use of prosodic information in ASR, a new approach of using 
temporal information to assist in Mandarin speech recognition is proposed. It incorporates two 
types of temporal information into the recognition search. One is a statistical syllable duration 
model which considers the influences of 411 base-syllables, 5 tones, 4 position-in-word factors, 
and 3 position-in-sentence factors on syllable duration. Another is the timing information of 
modeling three types of inter-syllable boundary including intra-word, inter-word without 
punctuation mark (PM), and inter-word with PM. The uses of these two types of temporal 
information are expected to be useful for improving the segmentation accuracies in both 
acoustic decoding and linguistic decoding. Experimental results showed that the 
base-syllable/character/word recognition rates were slightly improved for both MATBN and 
Treebank database.

 3. Incorporating of Syntactic Information in Pitch Modeling for Mandarin 
Speech 
In this section, a statistics-based syntax-prosody model of F0 for Mandarin speech is 
reported. The model considers three major affecting factors on the syllable pitch contour, 
including lexical tone, prosodic state and inter-syllable coarticulation effect. The study 
emphasizes on the incorporation of information extracted from syntactic tree into the model. An 
explicit relationship of the syntactic information and prosodic state is hence constructed. 
Experimental results show that the model performed well. By examining the prosodic states 
labeled automatically by the model, we found that most of them are syntactically meaningful. 
So it is a promising F0 model. 
3.1 Introduction 
Prosody modeling is to explore the information carrying on the prosodic features of 
human’s speech. Many issues are concerned in prosody modeling. They include the labeling of 
important prosodic cues [2], the construction of prosody hierarchy [3], the modeling of 
syntax-prosody relationship [6], the prediction of prosodic phrase boundary (break) from text, 
etc. It can be applied to many fields including speech recognition (SR) and text-to-speech (TTS) 
[4]. In SR, important prosodic cues can be explored from the input utterance to assist in both 
acoustic and linguistic decoding. In TTS, a good prosody model can be used to generate 
appropriate prosodic features from the input text. Among all prosodic features in prosodic 
modeling, F0 is the most important one. This is especially true for Mandarin speech which is 
known as a tonal language. In this paper, we are interested in syntax-prosody modeling to 
exploit the relationship of F0 contour and linguistic features for Mandarin speech. 
In a previous study, a statistics-based pitch model of Mandarin speech which considers 
three major affecting factors that influence the syllable pitch contour was discussed [1]. Those 
three affecting factors were the lexical tone and the prosodic state of the current syllable, and 
the inter-syllable coarticulation between two neighboring syllables. In that study, prosodic state 
roughly represented the state of the current syllable in a prosodic phrase and was treated as 
hidden. It was introduced to implicitly account all the effects of higher-level linguistic features 
on affecting the pitch contour variation. In this paper, we extend the previous prosodic 
modeling study to incorporate explicit syntactic information into the model to obtain a better 
syntax-prosody model for F0. 
3.2 The Proposed Pitch Model 
The proposed syllable pitch contour model considers the following three major affecting 
factors: lexical tone, prosodic state and inter-syllable coarticulation. The model is formulated 
based on the assumption that all affecting factors are combined additively and can be expressed 
by

Where ,k nx  and ,k ny  are vectors of four orthogonal expansion coefficients [4] representing, 
respectively, the observed and normalized  (i.e., residual) pitch contours of the n-th syllable in 
utterance k; ,k ntχ  is the affecting pattern of tone , {1,2,3,4,5}k nt ∈ ; ,k npχ  is the affecting

model is then expressed by

 3.3  Experimental Results 
Performance of the proposed pitch modeling method was evaluated using a Mandarin 
speech database. The database contained the read speech of a single female professional 
announcer. Its texts were all short paragraphs composed of several sentences selected from the 
Sinica Tree-Bank Corpus [5]. The database consisted of 380 utterances with 52192 syllables. 
In the simulation, we set the numbers of prosodic states and coarticulation states to be 16 
and 8, respectively. After well training, the covariance matrices of the original and normalized 
syllable F0 were

The variances had been reduced significantly by applying the model. This was especially true 
for the pitch mean. Fig.2 displays the patterns of five tones. They matched very well with our 
knowledge of standard tone patterns. 
 
Fig.2: The affecting patterns and their F0 mean values of five tones. 
Fig. 3 shows the affecting patterns of 16 prosodic states. As shown in the figure, States 2, 
3 and 4 have low and flat patterns and hence tend to be located at the trail of a prosodic phrase 
(because of the declination effect of F0). High probabilities of ( _ | )P EW FPB p  and 
( _ | )P EW FPBPM p  for p=2, 3 and 4, observed from the prosodic state model, also confirm that 
they appear at the ending boundary of syntactic phrase and sentence very often. Moreover, high 
transition probabilities of 2-2, 2-3, 3-2, 3-3, 4-3 and 4-4 observed from the state transition table 
show that the low and flat trail pattern of prosodic phrase (see Fig.4(c)) is common to appear. 
On the other hand, States 15, 14 and 12 have high and rising-falling patterns and hence tend to 
be located at the beginning of a prosodic phrase (to show the reset phenomenon). This finding 
can be further confirmed by the high probabilities of ( _ | )P PPB BW p  and ( _ | )P PPBPM BW p  
for p=15, 14 and 12 which show that they appear at the beginning boundary of syntactic phrase 
and sentence very often. Moreover, high transition probabilities of 15-10, 15-9, 15-13, 14-10, 
14-9, 14-7, 12-9 and 12-7 show that the rising-falling reset pattern (see Fig.4(a) and (b)) of 
prosodic phrase is common to appear. Typical examples are displayed in Fig.4.

Fig.7 displays a typical example of the reconstruction of 3-3 tone pattern. It can be seen 
from the figure that the second Tone 3, which had been changed to a sandhi Tone 2, was 
well-reconstructed via the use of coaticulation affecting pattern. Fig.8 displays a typical 
example of the reconstructed pitch contour and prosodic-state patterns of a sentence. It can be 
found from the figure that the reconstructed pitch contour matched its original counterpart well. 
We also found that the trajectory of the prosodic-state patterns was smoother and looked more 
resemble to a sequence of prosodic-word/phrase patterns. Moreover, a typical prosodic state 
pair of 15-13 (3-3) was appear at the beginning (end) of the sentence.

 4. The Use of Temporal Information in Mandarin Speech Recognition 
In this section, a new approach of using temporal information to assist in Mandarin speech 
recognition is discussed. It incorporates two types of temporal information into the recognition 
search. One is a statistical syllable duration model which considers the influences of 411 
base-syllables, 5 tones, 4 position-in-word factors, and 3 position-in-sentence factors on 
syllable duration. Another is the timing information of modeling three types of inter-syllable 
boundary including intra-word, inter-word without punctuation mark (PM), and inter-word with 
PM. The uses of these two types of temporal information are expected to be useful for 
improving the segmentation accuracies in both acoustic decoding and linguistic decoding. 
Experimental results showed that the base-syllable/character/word recognition rates were 
slightly improved for both MATBN and Treebank database. 
4.1  Introduction 
A real-world speech signal always contains rich temporal information ranging from 
lower-level information, such as phone/syllable/word duration, to higher-level rhythmic 
information, such as the final-syllable lengthening of prosodic phrase [8]. The temporal 
information is known to be very helpful for human beings to understand the speech more easily. 
However, in automatic speech recognition (ASR), the use of temporal information is still 
primitive. The most basic approach is to incorporate explicit state/phone/syllable duration 
models or durational constraints into the recognition search for improving the recognition 
accuracy [9-11]. Another approach is to invoke an embedded phone/syllable/word segmentation 
in the recognition search process to provide additional acoustic cues to assist in the recognition 
[12]. But, in all those studies only lower-level durational information, such as HMM state 
duration or syllable/word duration, was used. No higher-level temporal information was used.  
In this paper, a preliminary study of more sophisticatedly using temporal information to 
improve the ASR for Mandarin speech is discussed. It first extends the conventional 
base-syllable duration model to consider the influences of three additional affecting factors 
including tone, position-in-word, and position-in-sentence. With this extension, some 
higher-level temporal information is invoked in the recognition search. Secondly, it 
incorporates explicit timing information into the recognition search via constructing models for 
three types of inter-syllable boundary. These three types of inter-syllable boundary include 
intra-word, inter-word without punctuation mark (PM), and inter-word with PM. The timing 
information is expected to be helpful on the segmentation of correct word sequence in the 
recognition search.

where ( , )d dp X W Λ  is the score of syllable duration modeling, dX  is the syllable duration 
sequence derived from the segmentation information ϒ , and ( )lp W Λ  is the score of language 
decoding. Here, we assume that both acoustic model aΛ  and tone model tΛ  are independent 
of the segmentation and language decoding. In this study, a word-bigram model lΛ  is used.  
The syllable duration model adopted is a simple multiplicative model [9] which involves 
4 major affecting factors including base-syllable, tone, position-in-word, and 
position-in-sentence. In the model, the observed duration of syllable n is expressed by 
[ ] [ ] 
n n n nd d sy t wp sp
X n Z n γ γ γ γ=                                  (13) 
where [ ]dZ n  is the normalized (or residue) syllable duration and is modeled by a normal 
distribution 2( , )N µ σ  with mean µ  and variance 2σ ; 'sγ  are affecting factors; ,  ,  n n nsy t wp  
and nsp  represent, respectively, the base-syllable, tone, word position, and sentence position of 
syllable n. In the study, we consider 411 base-syllables, 5 tones, 4 types of position-in-word, 
and 3 types of position-in-sentence. The 4 types of position-in-word are mono-syllabic word, 
and the beginning, intermediate and ending syllables of a word. The 3 types of 
position-in-sentence are the beginning, intermediate and ending syllables of a sentence which is 
ended with a major PM.  
An iterative sequential optimization procedure is employed to train the syllable duration 
model. It first initializes the training by estimating all affecting factors independently, i.e.,

We then examined the performances of the MLP tone classifier (see Table 3) and MLP 
inter-syllable boundary classifier (see Table 4). It can be found from Table 3 that tone 
recognition rates of 75.1 and 85% were achieved for MATBN and Treebank, respectively. Both 
Tone 1 and Tone 4 were easier to be recognized while Tone 3 and Tone 5 were not. It can also 
be found from Table 4 that accuracy rates of 58.8% and 69.1% were achieved in the 
inter-syllable boundary classifications for MATBN and Treebank databases, respectively. The 
class of inter-word with PM was easier to be correctly detected.

Lastly, we examined the performance of the proposed method of using temporal 
information in Mandarin speech recognition. Table 5 displays the experimental results. It can 
be found from Table 5 that the baseline system which used the acoustic and language models, 
aΛ  and lΛ performs well. Base-syllable/character/word recognition rates were 
93.49/91.04/86.29 and 94.01/84.99/75.43 for the MATBN anchor and Sinica Treebank 
databases, respectively. It is noted that both character and word recognition rates for Treebank 
were relatively low as compared with those of MATBN because Treebank contained much 
more proper nouns and DM compound words which were treated as individual characters rather 
than words. The performances were slightly improved as we incorporated the tone recognizer.  
The performances were further improved for the proposed method as we used the temporal 
information in the recognition search.
