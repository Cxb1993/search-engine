Abstract: The dynamic wetting of 
non-Newtonian fluids on a solid surface is 
theoretically investigated in a viewpoint of 
kinetic theory. A multi-groups model is 
developed by an energy-balance method, based 
on Ree-Eyring equation for non-Newtonian 
viscosity and Blake’s molecular-kinetic theory 
for Newtonian wetting. Different wetting 
groups should be accounted for the 
characteristics of components of 
non-Newtonian liquid displacing on surfaces. 
The performance of dynamic wetting depends 
on the microscopic parameters of wetting 
groups together with their local faction in the 
vicinity of contact line. The present model fits 
experimental results of CMC aqueous solutions 
well and the fitting results suggest that wetting 
group of polymers is hopping with their 
adsorbed monomer units while the group of 
water is displacing wholly for each molecule. 
 
1. Introduction 
The dynamic wetting is an important issue 
in many natural and industrial processes. A 
great deal of researches was performed for 
understanding the physical nature of the 
moving contact line but no complete 
conclusion has been recognized yet 1. 
Nevertheless, in the last decade dynamic 
wetting study has extended to a much wider 
scope for novel applications, of which the hot 
topics are investigations related to corners/air 
pockets, complex fluids (polymers and 
surfactants), and evaporating drops 2. 
Three types of theoretical models 
conducting the relationship between dynamic 
contact angle and speed of wetting on rigid 
ideal surfaces were usually referred in reviews3, 
4 and data fitting of experiments 
5-8:molecular-kinetic 9-11, hydrodynamic 12-14 
and combined molecular- hydrodynamic 15. 
Blake and coworkers 9 based on Eyring’s 
activated rate theory 16, considered the 
movement of a contact line as the overall 
performance of molecular hopping processes 
on the surface, and manipulated the 
molecular-kinetic models as dissipation mainly 
consumed by the contact line friction, which 
will be described in later paragraph. In an 
opposite way, the hydrodynamic models by 
solving hydrodynamic equations emphases on 
the viscous dissipation of fluids. Two or three 
regions were divided for the flow 12, 14, while 
the inner region adjacent to the contact line 
need to be cutoff ad hoc 13 or introduced with 
slippage to relieve the flow singularity for 
Newtonian fluids. The combined 
molecular-hydrodynamic model, proposed by 
Petrov and Petrov 15, considered the 
microscopic contact angle in the hydrodynamic 
models should depend on velocity as expressed 
by Blake’s theory, which is also well known for 
dynamic wetting interpretation.

where a is the distance of two adjacent holes, δ

can be referred as relaxation time. The term in 
hyperbolic sine is usually much smaller than

where the factor δ/a can be taken to be unity 
because *vGD  is usually determined 
empirically by fitting experimental data. 
Ree and Eyring developed the former 
model to interpret the rheology of practical 
non-Newtonian fluids by recognizing the 
complex compositions 31, 32. They proposed that 
for a non-Newtonian fluid with n groups of 
flow unites the total shear force can be 
regarded as the weighted average of group’s 
contribution with a weight of xv, i. Thus, we 
have:

where xv, i is the fractional area of the shear

Eq. (5) was applied to the rheological data of 
plastics and high-polymer solutions and 
described the variety of viscosity finely 31, 32. 
Ree-Eyring model is recognized as one of the 
important viscosity models involving the 
interaction energy 33 and still utilized widely in 
recent tribology research34. 
 
2.2 Molecular-kinetic model for dynamic 
wetting systems 
Blake and coworkers derived an 
expression for dynamic contact angle θD from 
activated rate theory 9, which is usually referred 
as molecular-kinetic model in literature. The 
moving rate of contact line is determined by the 
frequency of forward and backward molecular 
hoppings on the solid surface within the 
three-phase zone, wk
+  and wk
-  respectively. 
At equilibrium, the contact line appears to be 
stationary and the net rate of displacement is 
zero, so that 0w w wk k k
+ -= = , where 0wk  is the 
equilibrium displacement frequency. Invoking 
activated rate theory 16, one can relate 0wk  to 
the molar activation free energy of wetting

where N is the Avogadro constant. *wGD  
represents an intrinsic energy barrier of wetting, 
which is proposed to consist of surface 
contribution *sGD  and viscous contribution

In dynamic situations the barrier is 
modulated by irreversible work w%  done on 
each site to release the molecules with 
preferable displacements, as illustrated in Fig. 
1(b). Assuming the modulating of barrier is

According to the assumption (c), the

In such a unit area there are 2w, 1 il  sites for 
the ith group to park itself, but considering the 
component’s fraction within the three-phase 
zone, only 2w, w, i ix l  sites are triggered during 
the sweeping of contact line. Consequently, the 
total irreversible dissipation equating the work 
offered by the out-of-balance interfacial tension

Note that if one set of parameters is enough to 
characterize the dynamic wetting system, like 
many cases engaged with Newtonian fluids, Eq. 
(17) can be reduced to a single-group form, the 
same as Blake’s formula Eq. (12). 
 
3. Discussion 
3.1 Characteristic parameters: ξw, i and ωw, i 
Eq. (15) is derived by energy equilibrium, 
while it also can be recognized in a viewpoint 
of force balance. The driving force, fσ, 
withstands the sum of dynamic wetting 
resistance rw, i brought up by the wetting 
groups:

termed “intrinsic wetting speed”, possess a 
speed dimension and relates to the wetting 
energy barrier. The resistance rw,i of a group is 
straightforwardly a product of three parts: its 
proportion at the three-phase zone, the basic 
resistant force and the dimensionless term of 
nonlinear response to macroscopic movement.  
The intrinsic wetting speed, ωw i, indicates 
for the ith wetting group how strong the 
dependence on dynamic wetting speed is. The 
speed ratio, macroscopic moving speed, U, 
nondimensionalized by intrinsic wetting speed,

comparison between two important timescales: 
0
w, 1 ik  is the relaxation time of molecular 
displacements under equilibrium conditions 10 
while w, 2 i Ul  is the time for covering the 
possible region per molecular displacement 
( w, il  from origin if hopping forward and 
w, il-  if backward) by the macroscopic 
movement. As w, iU w  increases, the 
nonlinear response varies from approximately 
linear form to logarithmic form, which exhibits 
in mathematics as the limit property of 
hyperbolic sine function in Eq. (18):

The first limit can be interpreted as that the 
local relaxations are fully finished, so the 
proceeding contact line hardly feels the 
molecular disturbance and the resistance is 
proportional to wetting speed like that of flows 
on a flat plate. The second limit is consistent 
with the implication that if strong interfacial 
force drives the liquids in a high wetting speed, 
the forward molecular displacements 
overwhelm those backward, i.e. Eq. (20) can be 
obtained for liquids of single component if

wetting resistance. If w, L w, H0.1r r= is regarded 
as low-barrier group emerging, invoking Eq. 
(20) into Eq. (21) can roughly estimated the 
wetting speed threshold for w, H w, H

 is in the order 
of unity, for example, it equals 0.5 and 3.87 for 
w, L w, Hw w  of 1 and 10
8 respectively. As the 
typical value of ωw is 2 mm s-1 shown in Fig. 3, 
the effect of low-barrier group is conservatively 
supposed to appear in experiments of wetting 
speed above a magnitude of mm s-1. 
As the ratio of U to ωw, i experiences 
different magnitudes, the total wetting 
resistance Eq. (18) for present bi-group system 
can reduce into approximate expressions: 
w w, H w, H w, L w, L w, L w, H

(23b) 
The total wetting resistance is linearly 
proportional to wetting speed at low U, the 
range of which depends on the intrinsic speed 
of high-barrier group, ωw, H. While at high U, 
the resistance is proportional to the logarithm 
of wetting speed, the range of which depends 
on the low-barrier group, ωw, L. 
Some instances of wetting resistance are 
calculated by Eq. (18) for a series of bi-group 
systems with specific characteristic parameters. 
The wetting barrier of Group II, *w, 2GD , and 
hopping distance λw, i of both groups are 
assigned to the typical values suggested by 
Schneemilch et al. 5. The fractional factor xw, i’s 
are equal for the two groups for highlighting 
the influence of ωw, i. Group I’s wetting barrier 
*
w, 1GD  is selected to yield different ratios of 
intrinsic wetting speed, w, 1 w, 2w w  ranging 
from 10-4 to 104. Especially, the case with ratio 
of unity presents the liquid wetting with a 
single component as Group II, which has been 
discussed in Blake’s model. The parameters are 
listed in Tab. 2. A wide range of wetting speed 
is calculated for revealing system 
characteristics, though air entrainments easily 
take place beyond some high wetting speeds in 
practical applications 4 where the assumption of 
present model fails. 
The variance of calculated wetting 
resistance rw is present in Fig. 4, which 
demonstrates the linear relationship between rw 
and logarithmic wetting speed at high U as 
described by Eq. (23b). The ratio of wr U  is 
shown in Fig. 5 for a clear view of low speed 
region, where resistance proportions to wetting 
speed as described by Eq. (23a). The intrinsic 
wetting speeds of low-barrier and high-barrier 
groups in calculation cases, which indicate the 
application scopes of approximate expressions 
Eq. (23a) and Eq. (23b), are also drawn in Fig. 
4 and Fig. 5 respectively. The componential 
resistances in Eq. (18) are also calculated with 
parameters above and the compare of two 
groups is shown in Fig. 6. At low wetting speed 
region, the contribution of low-barrier group is 
negligible. The relative strength of low-barrier 
group grows as wetting speed increases and 
should be taken into account beyond its 
intrinsic speed ( w, H w, H
w, L w, L

3.2.2 Influence of fraction xw, i 
The local fraction in the three-phase zone, 
xw, i, is certainly associated with the component 
concentration in liquid. One can expect that xw, i 
increases as the concentration of wetting group 
i increases. The control of fractional proportion 
is probably implemented by the addition or 
reduction of solute. Figure 7 presents the 
variance of wetting resistance with the same 
parameters of case w, 1 w, 2 0.01w w =  in Tab. 2, 
except the component fractions vary. The total 
wetting resistance is naturally increasing as 
more high-barrier group present, but its 
gradient appears independent of the 
componential fraction in the region of speeds 
over ωw, L. Differentiating Eq. (23b) with 
respect to lnU yields

 (24) 
At present ξw, H = ξw, L ( 2w, B w, 2i ik Tx l= ) so the 
slopes keep a same constant in fast wetting. Eq. 
 9 
dominates the dynamic wetting behavior. The 
concentration of 1% may coincide with the 
conformational transition of CMC at the 
vicinity of contact line. The microscopic 
parameters of two groups are listed in Tab. 4. 
The close values of ωw,1 and ωw,2 reveal similar 
responses of two groups to different dynamic 
wetting speeds. ξw,i as well as λw,i are much 
different for Group I and Group II. λw,1 
excesses the diameter of water molecules 
evidently, which suggests that the hopping 
distance of Group I depends on the surface 
properties. λw,2 is much smaller than λw,1 and 
approximates the length of anhydroglucose unit 
of CMC molecules, 0.63 nm 42. Additionally, 
the adsorption research on polymer solutions 
demonstrates that the polymers do not adsorb 
flat on the solid surface as a monomolecular 
layer, but only anchor on the surface at a few 
points with remainder parts moving more or 
less freely in the liquids 43. Therefore, 
according to such a λw,2 we guess that the 
long-chain molecules of Group II moving on 
the surface as the microscopic displacements of 
their monomer units step by step when the 
contact line proceeds, which is quite different 
from the case of whole molecular hopping of 
Group I. 
 
5. Conclusion 
A multi-groups model is developed for the 
dynamic wetting of shear-thinning fluids. With 
edification from Ree-Eyring viscosity equation, 
the well-known molecular-kinetic wetting 
theory is adapted with an understanding that 
dynamic wetting of non-Newtonian liquids 
attributes to two or more wetting groups 
displacing on solid surfaces. The local fraction 
at the vicinity of contact line is noted as xw, i for 
a specific group. The wetting groups are 
characterized by the basic resistant force ξw, i 
which depends on the microscopic hopping 
distance λw, i, and the intrinsic wetting speed ωw, 
i which depends on λw, i and the wetting energy 
barrier *w, iGD  of liquid components. In the 
case of w, H w, H
w, L w, L

»  of a bi-group system, the 
wetting group of high energy barrier prevails 
over the low-barrier one in the moving 
resistance of contact line. The contributions of 
high-barrier group overwhelms the other one in 
the wetting process of low speed, but the role 
of low-barrier group turns on in high speed 
cases. A rough estimation of the speed 
threshold of this transition is ωw, L. The increase 
of wetting resistance by raising the fraction of 
high-barrier group keeps for the case of ξw, H ≥ 
ξw, L. Otherwise the variance of wetting 
resistance with group fractions is not 
monotonic. The dynamic contact angles of 
three non-Newtonian liquids samples, CMC 
solutions of different concentrations, together 
with ultrapure water, were measured by a 
force-balance method. The fitting of 
experimental data shows a good agreement 
with the multi-groups model. The regression 
parameters accord with their physical meanings. 
Moreover, the results of hopping distance 
suggest that the wetting group of polymers is 
hopping with their adsorbed monomer units 
while the group of water is displacing wholly 
for each molecule.
