一、中文摘要 
在傳統的排程問題上，我們均假設工作件之處理時
間為一已知之常數。然而，在許多實際的生產工作
場合中，存在著一種現象──當工作一旦被耽擱而
較慢處理時，其後之加工處理時間會變得比預定時
間還長。譬如，Gupta 和 Gupta (1988)舉出在煉鋼
廠中，鑄塊(ingot)的處理時間會隨著等待被處理時
間拉長而變得更長，又譬如， Kunnathur 和
Gupta(1990)舉出在火災發生時，救火的工作會隨著
消防車來達火災地點時間的耽擱，而造成救火的時
間亦隨之拉長, 而 Mosheiov(1996)亦指出在醫療保
健方面，當健康狀況惡化後才就醫，其整個醫治復
原的過程將會拖得更久。睽諸以上種種現象，了解
到工作件的加工時間在其等待被處理的過程中受
到拖延時，則拉長了加工的處理時間。這些相關的
問題，一般稱之為「退化工作件排程問題」，且這
類問題已引起廣泛注意。 
   但是，大多探討退化性工作件之研究都忽略相
同、相似產品或零件一起處理時，可提高生產效能
這個事實。這個現象在文獻中，一般被稱為「群組
排程」。群組排程之好處已被許多實際應用例子加
以證實。例如：不同零件之間替換變的更容易，使
得更換成本降低；零件等待組裝的時間變小；讓等
待組裝之存貨成本降低；零件在生產線上之移動更

因此，本計畫，我們將探討退化性工作件在群組排

工作件處理時間與群組設置均為變動的。在若干不

(甚至總完工時間)最小化之最佳工作件排程或最

Abstract 
In the classical scheduling problems, job processing 
times are assumed to be constant from the first job to 
be processed until the last job to be completed. 
However, there are many situations in which a job that 
is processed later consumes more time than the same 
job when processed earlier. For instance, Gupta and 
Gupta (1988) provided an example of steel rolling 
mills where the temperature of an ingot, while waiting 
to enter the rolling machine, drops below a certain 
level, requiring the ingot to be reheated before rolling. 
Kunnathur and Gupta (1990) gave a fire fighting 
example where the time and effort required to control 
a fire increases if there is a delay in the start of the fire 
fighting effort. Browne and Mosheiov (1996) pointed 
out as another case the surgical operation for a patient 
under worsening conditions. In all of these cases, 
accomplishing a task may need more time as time 
passes. Scheduling in this setting is known as 
scheduling deteriorating jobs and has received 
increasing attention in recent years. 
However, most of the studies ignore the fact that 
production efficiency can be increased by grouping 
various parts and products with similar design and/or 
production process. This phenomenon is known as 
group technology in the literature. Many advantages 
have been claimed through the wide applications of 
group technology. For instance, changeover between 
different parts are simplified, thereby reducing the 
costs of changeovers; parts spend less time waiting, 
which results in less work-in-process inventory; parts 
tend to move through production in a direct route and 
hence the manufacturing lead time is reduced; the 
variability of tasks is reduced and hence worker 
training is simplified. Due to the fact that the setup 
time or the preparation work might prolong as the 
food deteriorates or the condition of the patient is 
worsened, we consider a situation where the setup 
time prolongs as well as jobs deteriorate while they 
wait for processed. To the best of our knowledge, the 
group technology with starting-time dependent setup 
time has seldom been discussed in the context of 
deteriorating jobs. In this project, the single-machine 
scheduling problems in the context of group 
technology concept where job processing times and 
setup times are functions of their starting times are 
considered. We will try to establish the optimal group 
sequence and job sequence for certain criteria, such as 
the makespan and the total completion times under

處理時間為變動的，群組設置時間還是假設為常

與設置時間也會隨著變長，如食物會變壞、病人

該會隨著變長。但同時考慮工作處理時間與群組
設置時間均會變動是從來沒被討論過的。於是，
個人在 2006 年 5 月考慮了此一情況，將工作處

Operation Research (2006)之接受。可見此一種設
置時間也會變動的情況有值得更深入被探討與
研究的必要性。 
    另一方面，Pinedo(2002)提出許多不同理由可
說明單機模型是很重要。ㄧ、單機模型雖然很簡
單，而且也可視為其他模型的ㄧ特例。二、單機模

有的。這些結果不但適用於單機模型，也可以提供
一些更複雜之機器模型之近似解。三、實務上，我
們往往把較複雜之機器模型之排程問題分解成一
些簡單單機問題。例如，具有瓶頸的一個複雜之機
器環境便可視為一單機模型。再者，群組排程在單
機問題也是很重要的。所謂的群組排程，是決定一
個最佳的工作排序和最佳的群組排序(Ham(1985)
和 Ham & Hitomi(1979))。本問題研究需要有一些
基本的假設；所有工作的待命時間皆為零，中途不
會損壞。同時一次只能處理一個工件，以及 
1. 將所有的工件分成若干群組，同一個群組內的

2. 每一個群組在上機之前，需要一段設置時間，

3. 每一個群組設置時間與群組順序，互相獨立。 
4. 每一個工作的設置時間，與群組排序和工作排

再者，群組排程之好處已被許多實際應用，加以證

Hyer(1989)、Burbidge(1979)、Allahverdi和Gupta 
等 作 者 (1999) 、 Cheng(1996) 、 Webster 和

三、研究結果與討論 
退化工作件最早是由 Browne 和 Yechiali(1990)
引用在單機排程的研究上，而同時考慮群組排程則
僅有 Guo 和 Wang(2006), Xu 等作者(2006)和 Wang
等作者三篇而已。但他們均假設群組之設置時間為
一固定常數。但事實上，群組設置時間和工作處理
時間一樣，也隨著延後處理而變長。因此，本計畫
主要參考個人 2006 年在 Computer and Operation

時，也儘可能找到反例，或甚至加入一些限制條件

simplified, thereby reducing the costs involved; parts 
spend less time waiting, which results in less 
work-in-process inventory; parts tend to move 
through production in a direct route, and hence the 
manufacturing lead time is reduced; the variability of 
tasks is reduced, and hence worker training is 
simplified [18-23]. However, the group technology 
has not been considered by most researchers in 
deteriorating jobs scheduling problems until recently. 
Guo and Wang [24] investigated the makespan 
minimization problem where the actual processing 
time is given by ( ) ( )ij ijp t p a bt= + . They showed 
that the problem is polynomially solvable under the 
group technology assumption. Under the same model, 
Xu et al. [25] proved that the total weighted 
completion time minimization problem remains 
polynomially solvable. Moreover, Wang et al. [26] 
showed that single-machine group scheduling 
problems are polynomially solvable where the 
objectives are to minimize the makespan and the total 
completion time under the model that 
( )ij ij ijp t a b t= − . However, they all assume that the 
group setup times are constant. Since longer setup or 
preparation might be necessary as food quality 
deteriorates or a patient’s condition worsens, we 
consider a situation where the setup time grows and 
jobs deteriorate as they wait for processing. To the 
best of our knowledge, Wu et al. [27] were probably 
the only authors who studied the deteriorating jobs 
scheduling problems under the group technology with 
the assumption that both the setup times and the job 
processing times are functions of their starting times. 
They showed that the makespan and the total 
completion time problems remain polynomially 
solvable under the model that tts ii δ=)(  and 
ttp ijij α=)( . In this paper, we investigate two 
single-machine scheduling problems in the context of 
group technology under a different model where the 
setup times and the job processing times are both 
linear functions of their starting times. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Notation and problem formulation are described in 
Section 2. The solution procedures for the makespan 
problem and the sum of completion times problem are 
described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The 
conclusion is given in the last section. 
2. Notation and problem statement 
In this section, the notation that is used throughout 
the paper will be introduced first, followed by the 
formulation of the problem. 
Notation:  
m  the number of groups ( 2≥m ) 
iG  group i, 1, 2,...,i m=  
jn  the number of jobs in jG , 
mj ,...,2,1=  
N  the total number of jobs (i.e., 
Nnnn m =+++ …21 ) 
ijJ  job j  in iG , 1, 2,...,i m= , 
1, 2,..., ij n=  
iδ  the basic setup time for iG , 
1, 2,...,i m=  
ijα  the basic processing time for ijJ , 
1, 2,...,i m= , 1, 2,..., ij n=  
)( jiα  the basic processing time for the j th 
job in iG  when jobs are arranged in 
non-decreasing order of their basic 
processing times; that is, 
)()2()1( iniii
ααα ≤≤≤ " , 
1, 2,...,i m= , 1, 2,..., ij n=  
b       the deterioration rate of jobs, where 0>b . 
g       the deterioration rate of setup, where g＞0. 
is  the actual setup time of iG  
ijp  the actual processing time of ijJ  
S  a schedule of N  jobs 
)(SCij  the completion time of ijJ  under 
schedule S  
maxC  the makespan of all jobs 
∑ ijC  the sum of completion times 
There are N  jobs classified into m  groups 
ready to be processed on a single machine. All jobs 
are available at time 0t , where 0 0t > . Jobs in the 
same group are processed consecutively. A setup time 
precedes the processing of each group. The actual job 
processing time of ijJ  is a linear function of its 
starting time t ; that is, 
btp ijij +=α , 1, 2,...,i m= , 1, 2,..., ij n=  
where b is the deterioration rate. Moreover, the actual 
setup time of iG  is also a linear function of its 
starting time t  and as follows: 
gts ii += δ , 1, 2,...,i m=  
where g is the deterioration rate. 
Let G  indicate that the problem is a group 
scheduling problem. Using the conventional notation, 
the makespan and the sum of completion times 
minimization problems are denoted as 1 G , 
gts ii += δ , btp ijij += α / Cmax and 1 G , 
gts ii += δ , btp ijij += α ∑ ijC/ , 
respectively. 
3.  The makespan problem 
In this section, we consider a single-machine group 
scheduling problem with deteriorating values of time. 
It is assumed that the actual job processing time is a

Step 1. Arrange the jobs of each group in 
non-decreasing order of their basic 
processing times ijα , i.e.,

1, 2,...,i m= . 
Step 2. Arrange the groups in non-decreasing

It is seen that the complexity of obtaining the 
optimal job sequence within iG  is )log( ii nnO  
and that of obtaining the optimal group sequence is 
)log( mmO . Hence, the complexity of Algorithm 1 
is at most )log( NNO . An illustrative example 
(Example 1) is given in the appendix. 
4. The sum of completion times problem 
In this section, we deal with another single-machine 
group scheduling problem when the deterioration is 
considered. The objective is to find a schedule that 
minimizes the sum of completion times of all jobs. 
Once again, the actual job processing times and the 
actual group setup times are assumed as linear 
functions of their starting times. In addition, we first 
assume that all the groups have the same job size. 
That is, nnn m ==="1 . We then provide the 
optimal job sequence and group sequence under this 
condition. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm 
for the case of unequal job sizes. 
Theorem 2. For the 1 G , gts ii += δ , 
btp ijij += α ∑ ijC/  problem, if all the groups 
have the same number of jobs, then the optimal 
schedule is obtained if jobs within the same group are 
ordered according to the smallest basic processing 
time first (SPT) rule:

Proof. We prove the theorem by contradiction. First, 
we will show that jobs within the same group are 
ordered according to the SPT rule. Consider an 
optimal schedule S  where the jobs in the same 
group do not follow the SPT rule. In this schedule, 
there must be at least one iG  with at least two 
adjacent jobs, say iuJ  followed by ivJ , such that 
iviu αα > . Furthermore, we assume that t  is the 
starting time for iuJ  in S . We now perform an 
adjacent pair-wise interchange of iuJ  and ivJ , 
leaving the remaining jobs in their original positions, 
to derive a new sequence S ′ . Under S , 
iviuiv btbSC αα ++++= )1()1()( 2 , 
whereas under S ′ , 
iuiviu btbSC αα ++++= )1()1()'( 2 . 
Furthermore, the completion times of jobs processed 
before iuJ  and ivJ  are the same since they are 
processed in the same order. In addition, we have 
)()()( iviujuiv bSCSC αα −=′−  
               0> ,  
since iviu αα > . It implies that job processed after 
iuJ  and ivJ  under S  has a later starting time 
than the same job under 'S . Thus, 
)'()( SCSC ijij ∑∑ −           
)'()'()()( SCSCSCSC iuiviviu −−+≥  
))(1( iviub αα −+=  
0> . 
This contradicts the optimality of S  and proves that 
jobs within the same group are ordered according to 
SPT rule. 
Next, we will show that the group order follows the 
specified rule. Consider an optimal schedule Q  in 
which the group order does not follow the rule. In this 
schedule, there must be at least two adjacent groups, 
iG  followed by jG , such that

5.  Conclusions 
Recently, there are a growing number of 
researchers that assume the job processing times are 
increasing function of their starting times; this is 
known as deteriorating jobs or start-time dependent 
processing time scheduling problems. However, the 
group technology is seldom discussed in the context 
of deteriorating job scheduling problems. Moreover, 
group setup times are assumed to be known and fixed. 
In reality, longer setup or preparation might be 
necessary as food quality deteriorates or a patient’s 
condition worsens. This paper considers a model 
where both the setup times and job processing times 
are lengthened as jobs wait to be processed on a single 
machine. We show that the makespan minimization 
problem remain polynomially solvable. For the sum of 
completion times problem, we show that the problem 
remains polynomially solvable under the assumption 
that the numbers of jobs in each group are equal. In 
addition, a heuristic algorithm is proposed for the case 
of unequal job sizes, and it is quite accurate when the 
deterioration rate is small.

Abstract 
Conventionally, job processing times are known and 
fixed. However, there are many situations where the 
job processing time deteriorates as time passes. In this 
note, we consider the makespan problems under the 
group technology or batch production with 
deteriorating setup and processing times. That is, the 
job processing times and group setup times are 
linearly increasing (or decreasing) functions of their 
starting times. For both linear functions, we show that 
the makespan problems remain polynomially solvable. 
In addition, the constructive algorithms are also 
provided.

1. Introduction 
Conventionally, the job processing times are 
assumed to be known and fixed from the first job to 
be processed till the last job to be completed. 
However, there are many situations where the actual 
job processing time may prolong or shorten if it is 
processed at a later time. Examples of increasing 
processing times might occur in many situations, such 
as steel rolling mills where an ingot needs to be 
reheated if the temperature drops below a certain level 
while waiting in the buffer between the furnace and 
the rolling machines (Gupta & Gupta, 1988), in the 
fire fighting where a delay in the start of the fire 
fighting might require more effort to control the fire 
(Kunnathur & Gupta, 1990), in the military situation 
searching for an object under worsening weather or 
growing darkness, in a medical procedure under 
deteriorating health conditions (Mosheiov, 1996). In 
those cases, a job that is processed later consumes 
more time than the same job when processed earlier. 
On the other hand, there are situations where job 
processing time is a decreasing function of its starting 
time, such as repeated processing of similar tasks 
improves the worker skills, and harvesting may 
exhibit decreasing processing times as crop dries 
(Alidaee & Womer, 1999).  
 Scheduling in this setting is known as 
time-dependent processing time scheduling problem 
and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. It 
was first introduced independently by Gupta and 
Gupta (1988) and Browne and Yechiali (1990). Since 
then, related models of time-dependent processing 
times have been extensively studied from a variety of 
perspectives (Cheng & Ding, 2003; Wang & Xia, 
2006; Wu & Lee, 2006). Most results on this topic 
assume that job processing time is a linear or 
piecewise linear function of its starting time. 
Comprehensive reviews of different models and 
problems concerning jobs with starting time 
dependent processing times were given by Alidaee 
and Womer (1999) and Cheng et al. (2004). 
On the other hand, the production efficiency can be 
increased by grouping various parts and products with 
similar designs and/or production processes. This 
phenomenon is known as group technology in the 
literature. Many advantages have been claimed 
through the wide applications of group technology or 
batch production, such as the possibility of a flowshop 
pattern on the process route, reduction of setup time 
and cost, simplification of material flow handling, 
rationalization of design, and standardization of 
production processes (Burbidge, 1979; Ham et al, 
1985; Allahverdi et al., 1999). However, the group 
technology is relatively unexplored in the context of 
time-dependent processing time scheduling problems. 
Guo and Wang (2005) considered the model that the 
actual processing time is given by 
( ) ( )ij ijp t p a bt= + , where ( )ijp t and ijp  denote 
the actual and basic processing times of job Jij, a and 
b are positive constants, and t is its starting time.  
They showed that the makespan problem is 
polynomially solvable under the group technology 
assumption. Under the same model, Xu et al. (2007) 
showed that the total weighted completion time 
problem is polynomially solvable. In addition, Wang 
et al. (2007) investigated two single-machine group 
scheduling problems under the model that 
 16
contradiction of the optimality of S .  
In addition, we assume that the starting time to 
process job iuJ  in S  is t. Under S , the 
completion times of iuJ  and ivJ  are 
iuiuiu atbSC ++= )1()( , 
and 
iviviuiviuiv abatbbSC +++++= )1()1)(1()(
, 
whereas under S ′ , they are 
iviviv atbSC ++=′ )1()( , 
and 
iuiuiviuiviu abatbbSC +++++=′ )1()1)(1()(
. 
Since 
iv
iv
iu
iu
b
a
b
a > , we have 
   )()()( iuiviviuiuiv babaSCSC −=′−  
0> . 
Thus, it implies that the makespan of jobs under S  
is strictly greater than that under 'S . This contradicts 
the optimality of S  and proves that the jobs in each 
group are ordered in non-decreasing order of 
iu
iu
b
a
. 
Next, we will show the optimal rule for the group 
sequence by a similar adjacent group interchange 
argument. Assume that there are two adjacent groups 
iG  and jG  in the optimal sequence Q  with 
group iG  immediately preceding jG  and with

5.  Conclusions 
The group technology or batch production is 
relatively unexplored in the context of deteriorating 
job scheduling problems until recently. In addition, 
the group setup times are assumed to be constant. In 
reality, process setup or preparation often requires 
more time as food quality deteriorates or a patient’s 
condition worsens. On the other hand, the setup time 
might shorten due to learning during the production 
process. This paper considers situations where both 
setup and job processing times are lengthened (or 
shortened) as jobs wait to be processed. Specifically, 
we investigate two single-machine group scheduling 
problems where group setup times and job processing 
times are increasing (or decreasing) functions of their 
starting times. We show that the makespan problems 
remain polynomially solvable when deterioration is 
considered. In addition, two polynomial algorithms 
are proposed for the problems. 
The processing times and setup times might 
increase contentiously if the number of jobs or batches 
increase under the assumptions that the processing 
times and the setup times are linear functions of the 
starting times. Thus, to consider group technology or 
batch production in other models might be an 
interesting issue for future research.
