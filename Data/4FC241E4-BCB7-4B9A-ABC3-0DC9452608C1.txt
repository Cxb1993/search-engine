been reported to jointly estimate these three 
parameters. The latter are in particular 
computationally attractive, as they are free of 
higher-dimensional search on the azimuth-elevation 
frequency plane. For example, Haardt et al. [1] 
addressed a 3- D unitary-ESPRIT to estimate these 
three parameters by extending the computationally 
efficient 1-D Unitary ESPRIT to 3-D scenarios. 
Strobach [4] incorporated a total least squares phased 
averaging method in the 3-D ESPRIT for signal 
subspace estimates to increase the estimation accuracy. 
Despite the effectiveness of [1, 4], they call for high 
computational overhead due to higher-dimensional 
data stacking and eigendecomposition. On the other 
hand, an efficient ESPRIT algorithm was recently 
considered in [5], which, however, needs special 
antenna array geometry. 
In order to yield high estimation accuracy with 
low computational complexity, this paper proposes an 
HSTD-based algorithm for joint estimation of the 
azimuth and elevation angles, and frequencies of the 
incoming signals. The essence of the proposed 
algorithm lies in a succinct combination of the 
parameter estimation and temporal filtering/spatial 
beamforming processes, in which the parameters are 
estimated alternatively in a hierarchical tree structure. 
More specifically, the proposed algorithm makes use 
of a sequence of 1-D Unitary ESPRIT algorithms to 
estimate these parameters in a coarse-fine manner. In 
addition, to enhance the estimation accuracy, in 
between every other 1-D ESPRIT algorithm, a 
temporal filtering process or a spatial beamforming 
process is invoked to partition the incoming signals 
into finer groups. Based on such an HSTD technique, 
not only the estimation accuracy is enhanced, but the 
pairing of these parameters is automatically achieved 
without extra computations. Simulation results show 
that the new algorithm provides satisfactory 
performance but with drastically reduced 
computations compared with previous works.

Data Model 
Consider a uniform rectangular array (URA) with 
M × N omni-directional antennas. Assume that there 
are K uncorrelated narrowband sources { ( )}ks t , each 
of which is carried by the frequency kf , impinging 
on the URA, where each antenna is followed by a 
tapped delay line with L time delay elements of delay 
Ts, as shown in Fig.1. 
By sampling the output of each antenna at a rate 
fs =1/Ts, the observed signal at time t at the lth delay 
element output of the (m,n)th antenna element can be 
expressed as

denotes the white noise with power 2nσ  at the lth 
delay element of the (m,n)th antenna. Note that for the 
employment of the Unitary ESPRIT, the reference

of generality, M N, and L are all assumed to be even. 
 
PROPOSED FAST ALGORITHM： 
The proposed algorithm begins with the 
estimation of the frequencies of the incoming signals, 
as in general we have more temporal data to render a 
precise frequency estimate. To achieve this, we first 
construct ( )f tX  by stacking ( )mnlx t  as 
11 1 1( ) [ ( ), , ( ) , ( ), , ( )]f M N MNt t t t t= w w w wL MLM LX x x x x  (2)

incoming rays, except those in the (i, j)th groups, will

Note that the incoming signals in the (i, j)th 
subgroup, which posses close u components (close to 
ui,j), will have diverse v’s. As such, the v components 
for the signals in each subgroup can be well resolved. 
To estimate v, we stack the filtered matrix

Note that the f’s and u’s estimated above are 
rather rough when these parameters are closely spaced. 
Consequently, we can get a more precise estimate of 
f’s and u’s by carrying out the 1-D Unitary ESPRIT 
again based on the finer groups of data. For this, we 
construct another set of spatial projection matrices

respectively, with the center frequencies [100; 103; 
103; 180] MHz. S = 200 symbols are employed to 
estimate the temporal and spatial covariance matrices. 
For each specific SNR, 200 Monte Carlo trials are 
carried out. The comparison of the 
root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of frequencies, 
elevation and azimuth angles based on the proposed 
algorithm and [1] and [4] is shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, 
respectively, where the Cramer-Rao lower bound 
(CRLB) is also provided for reference. 
We can note from Figs. 3-5 that the proposed 
algorithm produces close performance as the 
algorithms in [1, 4] in all of the estimates. Meanwhile, 
[1] and [4] need to stack the data to simultaneously 
estimate these parameters and thus roughly require (6S 
+2/3MNL)M2N2L2 and (8S+8/3MNL+34K)M2N2L2 
real multiplications, respectively, which are far more 
computationally expensive than the proposed 
algorithm. In contrast, the proposed algorithm only 
involves 1-D unitary ESPRIT and thus the 
computational overhead is substantially reduced. 
 
四、 計畫成果自評 
Compared with current estimation algorithms for joint 
estimations of the 2-D DOAs and carrier frequencies 
in existing literature, the proposed algorithms possess 
the following attractive attributes: (1) it only employes 
the 1-D Unitrary ESPRIT to estimate these three 
parameters, so the computation complexity is 
substantially reduced; (2) the pairing of parameters is 
automatically reached without extra complexity; (3) 
With the ingenious incorporation of the temporal 
filtering and spatial beamforming processes, the noise 
power is reduced which results in enhanced  
estimation accuracy. Simulation results are also 
furnished to justify the proposed approach. This 
research result has been submitted to Signal 
Processing and is currently under the review process. 
Right now, we are working on the extension of this 
HSTD technique to other similar signal processing or 
communication problems
