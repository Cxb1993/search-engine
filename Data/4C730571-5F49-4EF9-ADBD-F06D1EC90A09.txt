2Overall Abstract
This sub-project is dedicated to resolving the hierarchical structures of the supramolecular
comb-coil and hairy rod-coil block copolymers prepared by Sub-project 1 and 2. SAXS, WAXS
and TEM have been used for the structure characterization, in particular that
temperature-dependent SAXS and WAXS have been utilized to probe the thermally-induced phase
transition processes such as order-order transition (OOT) and order-disorder transition (ODT).
The effects of molecular architecture of the starting block copolymer (linear vs. hetero-arm star vs.
block-arm star), copolymer composition and molecular weight, complex compositon, strength of
secondary bonding (ionic vs. hydrogen) and the length of the alky tails of the low-molecular
weight amphiphiles have been systematically investigated. The major findings include: (a) the
first discovery of a tetragonally packed cylinder structure in a PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) comb-coil
diblock copolymer, (b) the first study on the effect of molecular architecture on the hierarchical
assembly and phase transition of comb-coil block copolymers, where the introduction of
non-linear architecture is found to elevate the TODT’s significantly, (c) discovery the formation of a
nanostructure with several nm in characteristic length in a P3HT-b-PMMA rod-coil diblock
copolymer, (d)the demonstration of the formation of highly oriented nanowires in the films of the
hairy-rod complex of polyaniline with PEOPA. Most of these important findings have been
published in the best journal in polymer science, Macromolecules, and a number of manuscripts
are under preparation and will be submitted to the high-impact journals.

6Introduction
It is well known that block copolymers self-organize into a series of long-range ordered
nanostructures due to repulsion between the covalently connected blocks.1-7 Similar to block
copolymers are polymers with comb-shaped architecture which also exhibit the propensity to
self-organize in similar way.8 In comb-shaped polymers, the covalent or permanent bonding
between the backbone and the repulsive side chains may be replaced by the physical bonding such
as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and metal-mediated coordination bonds to form supramolecules
which may analogically self-organize to form mesomorphic nanostructures.9-21 In a special case, if
one of the blocks of a diblock copolymer is selectively complexed with amphiphilic molecules, the
resulting supramolecular comb-coil diblock may exhibit hierarchical assembly at two length
scales;19 namely, a larger-length-scale assembly due to the microphase separation between the comb
and coil blocks and another shorter-length-scale ordering inside the comb block domains driven by
the microphase separation between the backbone and the side chains. Such supramolecular
comb-coil complexes have been drawing significant interest recently due to their potential use as
functional materials in electrical, optical, and other functionalities.22-34 The self-organized
domains at multiple length scales offer switch-like controls of material functionalities by the
relevant order-disorder or order-order transitions.13
The self-assembly behavior of the supramolecular comb-coil complexes formed by the linear
diblock copolymers is more or less well understood. Recently, we have been interested in
exploring the microphase separation behavior in the supramolecular comb-coil complexes where
the block copolymer backbone has a non-linear architecture.35 The novel macromolecular
architectures in non-linear block copolymers offer promising way to modulate the free energy
balance and thus the phase state of the block copolymers.36-39 Like linear diblock copolymers, these
polymeric species undergo microphase separation to form well-ordered structures. Hence, the
different architecture results naturally in much slower phase separation kinetics and modification of
the phase behavior.4,7,40-50 Thus the block copolymer molecular architecture may also considerably
influence the phase state of the supramolecular comb-coil complexes.
In a previous study, we investigated the molecular architecture effect on the microphase
separation in the supramolecular comb-coil complexes using a (AB)n(A)n type block-arm
polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) with the P2VP block complexed with an
amphiphilic surfactant, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA).35 Some remarkable differences in
the phase transition temperatures and interdomain spacing between the block-arm complex and its
linear counterpart were observed. In the present study, we direct our attention to the comb-coil
complexes formed by a AnBn hetero-arm star copolymer. As shown in Figure 1(a), hetero-arm star
copolymers are star-shaped molecules constituted of a central core bearing arms of pure polymer A
and pure polymer B. The previous studies have shown that, due to the chain crowding at the star
junction, the phase behavior and the domain spacing of neat AnBn hetero-arm star copolymers differ
8and no quantitative analysis using arm number as a parameter was attempted, the polydispersity in
arm number would not have any significant effect on the issues discussed in this work as long as the
copolymer under study possessed the hetero-arm architecture.
The copolymer obtained after the purification had a Mw of 51870 with a polydispersity index of
1.1, and the volume fractions of PS in the neat copolymer and the stoichiometric complex were 0.50
and 0.20, respectively. The average number of arms in the hetero-arm star copolymer was 9.0;
therefore the copolymer was denoted as PS5P2VP5 and henceforth will be referred as HA. The
detailed molecular characteristics of HA along with that of the linear diblock (LA) and the
block-arm (BA) copolymers investigated in our previous work are given in Table 1.
Complex Preparation. The HA star copolymer and DBSA were first dissolved in THF separately
to form clear solutions. The HA(DBSA) complex with binding fraction x = 1.0 was then prepared
by combining appropriate quantity of the two solutions. The binding fraction represented the
average number of DBSA molecules bound with a P2VP monomer unit. The solution was stirred
for 24 hours followed by slowly evaporating the solvent at room temperature. The samples were
finally dried in vacuum at 60 oC for two days to remove the residual solvent.
SAXS Measurements. SAXS measurements were performed using a Bruker Nanostar SAXS
instrument. The X-ray source, a 1.5 kW X-ray generator (Kristalloflex 760) equipped with a Cu
tube, was operated at 35 mA and 40 kV. The scattering intensity was detected by a
two-dimensional position-sensitive detector (Bruker AXS) with 512 x 512 channels. The area
scattering pattern has been radially averaged to increase the photon counting efficiency compared
with the one-dimensional linear detector. The intensity profile was output as the plot of the
scattering intensity (I) vs. the scattering vector, q = 4/sin(/2) (= scattering angle). All
scattering data were corrected by the empty beam scattering, the sensitivity of each pixel of the area
detector, and thermal diffuse scattering. Details regarding correction for thermal diffusion
scattering have been described elsewhere.35 Temperature-dependent SAXS measurements were
performed under vacuum to minimize the thermal degradation of the sample. The sample was first
equilibrated at the measuring temperature for 20 mins followed by 1 hr data acquisition.
Results and Discussion
Self-assembly and ODT of the neat hetero-arm star copolymer. For the convenience of
presentation, the PS5P2VP5 hetero-arm star copolymer is denoted by “HA”.  Figure 2(a) and (b) 
shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of neat HA in the temperature range of 25 to 290
oC. The SAXS profiles at low temperatures showed a relatively sharp primary maximum at 0.45
nm-1 and a weak second-order peak near 0.90 nm-1, indicating the formation of a lamellar
morphology consisting of alternating PS and P2VP lamellae. This morphological structure was
expected considering the composition of the HA copolymer (i.e., the volume fraction of PS, fPS ≈ 
10
between clusters of like monomers, though other mechanisms such as chain stiffening and crowding
effects near star branch point were not precluded. Buzza et al.44 showed that the difference in
TODT observed in their system was consistent with the degree of chain stretching observed
experimentally. However, in the present study we found that although the TODT of HA was greater
than that of LA, the interlamellar distance of these two systems was close.
It was rather unexpected that the domain spacings of HA and LA were similar as the previous
studies had predominantly shown that interlamellar distance was larger in the hetero-arm star
copolymers compared to the linear copolymers of equivalent block length.44,46,48-50 Grayer et al.48
studied PS6P2VP6 hetero-arm copolymer and found that the dependence of the interlamellar
distance on block length deviated from N2/3 scaling law (known for linear diblocks). In this case,
the interlamellar distance followed N scaling law with > 2/3. Nevertheless the architecture
effect on the domain spacing was most significant in the region of intermediate arm length (with N
~ 400-500) and diminished at higher N when the arms became sufficiently long to screen the effect
of conformational peculiarities at the interface. The similar interdomain distance between HA and
LA studied here might be due to the relatively low molecular weight of the system (N ~ 70-80);
because the ratio DHA/DLA ~ N- 2/3 decreases with decreasing N, namely, the difference in the
interlamellar distance between hetero-arm and linear block copolymers is expected to become more
insignificant at smaller N.
Hierarchical structures and ODT of the comb-coil complexes. The phase behavior of the
HA(DBSA) supramolecular comb-coil complex was probed by SAXS. Figure 4(a) and (b) display
the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of HA(DBSA) complex. The SAXS profile at 25 oC
showed a scattering maximum at q = 0.38 nm-1 and a broad shoulder (marked by “i = 1”) at q 0.69
nm-1. Another peak of strong intensity was observed in the high-q region at q = 2.07 nm-1. The
SAXS peaks in the low-q region were associated with the larger-scale structure due to microphase
separation between PS and P2VP(DBSA) blocks (giving rise to copolymer domains). On
increasing the temperature the two low-q peaks became more intense. At 240 oC the higher-order
scattering peaks associated with the long-range order of the copolymer domains became visible
(Figure 4(b)). The lattice scattering was even clearer in the SAXS profile of the 240oC-annealed
sample collected using synchrotron radiation source (see Supporting Information). The positions
of the lattice peaks here closely followed the ratio of 1:31/2:41/2, indicating that the complex
contained hexagonally packed PS cylinders in the P2VP(DBSA) matrix. The cylinder
morphology was also confirmed by TEM for the as-cast complex (see Supporting Information).
Hence the copolymer domain morphology of HA(DBSA) complex was similar to that observed for
LA(DBSA) complex reported in our previous work.35
The long-range order of the PS cylinders was not attained in the as-cast state since the
corresponding SAXS profile only showed a broad scattering peak at 0.38 nm-1 (corresponding to the
interdomain distance of 16.5 nm-1) (cf. Figure 4(a).  The shoulder marked by “i = 1” was

stability of the domain and (ii) the thermodynamic stability of the lattice. In sphere-forming
systems, domain stability overwhelmed the lattice stability, the lattice was thus more susceptible to
the thermal agitation than the domain, such that the lattice disintegrated at a lower temperature than
the micelles. However, in lamellae-forming or cylinder-forming systems, the two factors were
nearly equally important. Thus, domains and lattices were destroyed at nearly the same
temperature.
However, the hexagonally packed PS cylinders in the present HA(DBSA) complex did
undergo a lattice disordering at 280 oC. In this case, the PS domains were highly stable because
the strong repulsion between the polar P2VP(DBSA) blocks and the non-polar PS blocks prevented
the mixing of the two types of block chains. On the other hand, the lattice stability might not be as
strong, since the P2VP(DBSA) matrix was fluid-like and the intense thermal fluctuations in this
phase may perturb the ordered packing of the PS domains.
The micelle-free homogenous state was not accessible for the HA(DBSA) complex within the
experimental temperature range, showing that its TODT was higher than 290 oC. Hence, the TODT
of the HA copolymer was raised by more than 100 oC upon complexation with DBSA. Similar
increase of TODT was also found for LA(DBSA) complex in our previous study35 and was attributed
to the increased polarity of P2VP blocks on complexation with DBSA because of the presence of
ionic moiety.
Figure 5(b) displays the interdomain distance as a function of T-1. A discontinuous change in
D was observed at 260 oC which corresponded to a transition from the hexagonal lattice to the
disordered PS cylinder structure. D in the disordered cylinder phase was found to be larger than
that in the ordered state. Kim et al. had made similar observation in a sphere-forming
polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-but-1-ene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS-8) triblock copolymer.59
According to them the smaller D and the smaller radius of the spheres in the BCC lattice compared
with those in the disordered micelle state resulted from the constraint of the BCC lattice; namely,
the spheres in a regular BCC phase were slightly collapsed compare with those in the disordered
state. This was also reported for a polystyrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene (SIS)
copolymer by Sakamoto et al.,60 who attributed this increase in D upon the LDT to the broken
symmetry. However the increase of D across the LDT in the present HA(DBSA) complex was
very significant, so some other factors which are not clear at present may also be responsible for the
observed behavior.
We now turn to the temperature dependence of the high-q scattering peak located at 2.07 nm-1.
This peak was attributed to the primary diffraction maximum from the smaller-scale lamellar
structure (with an interlamellar distance of 3.0 nm) organized by the P2VP(DBSA) comb blocks.35
The presence of the lamellar mesophase was also supported by the POM observation showing the
mesomorphic birefringent pattern (see Supporting Information). Hence, the HA(DBSA)
14
LA(DBSA) complex. Let us assume that joining two diblock chains from 2AB to A2B2 together
reduces the entropy in I by kB lnVI and II by kB lnVII, with VI and VII being the volume of the
interfacial region formed by the microphase separation between the two blocks in the two states.
Since disordering of the smaller-scale structure from I to II increases the area of the interface, VI <
VII. If So is the transition entropy per diblock chain in a linear diblock complex, the transition
entropy (per AB block chain) in the AnBn complex to a first approximation would be
The 1/n factor arose because the formation of an AnBn star from nA1B1 reduces the number of
copolymer molecules in the system by a factor of 1/n. Hence, the entropy of transition was lower
in HA(DBSA) complex according to eq. (2), which then caused an increase of TODT for the
smaller-scale lamellar mesophase.
Finally, it would be worthwhile to consider the effect of molecular architecture on the
copolymer domain spacing in the comb-coil complexes. Figure 8 shows a comparative plot of the
interdomain distance of the large-scale copolymer domains as a function of T-1 for LA(DBSA),
BA(DBSA) and HA(DBSA) complexes. D in HA(DBSA) complex was observed to be smaller
than that in LA(DBSA) complex but it was significantly larger than that in BA(DBSA) complex.
The small interdomain distance in HA(DBSA) complex compared to LA(DBSA) was attributed to
the lower aggregation number of the PS blocks within the cylindrical microdomains due to its
particular architecture. It had been reported that hetero-arm star copolymers formed micelles with
lower aggregation number in a selective solvent,61,62 which might be due to better saturation of the
core-corona interface by the fewer corona chains. Due to localization of the junction points at the
interface, the volume available to each arm was less than the simple linear diblock.
The difference in the interdomain distance between HA(DBSA) and BA(DBSA) complex was
more striking since both complexes have star like structure. This interesting behavior may be
explained by considering the recent Monte-Carlo simulation results obtained by Chang et al.63 for
explaining the self-assembly of star copolymers in selective solvents. According to the simulation
results for the spherical micelles, the block-arm star copolymers tended to form unimolecular
micelle structure since the copolymer molecules always showed intermolecular repulsions, which
made them rather difficult to form multimolecular micelles. By contrast, the hetero-arm star
copolymer displayed Janus segregation, leading to intermolecular attraction and hence the
formation of multimolecular micelles. Therefore, the aggregation number (per unit length of the
cylinder) of the PS blocks in the cylindrical microdomain of HA(DBSA) complex was much higher
than that in BA(DBSA) as shown in Figure 9, thereby leading to a larger PS domain size in the
former. Furthermore, it can be easily shown that under a given cylinder volume fraction, the larger
cylindrical domain will result in a larger thickness of the corona surrounding the microdomain.
Hence the coronal thickness in the BA(DBSA) complex was also smaller than that in the

II. Molecular Architecture Effect on the Self-Assembly Behavior of Comb-Coil Block
Copolymers Displaying Lamellae-within-Lamellae Morphology
Abstract
Supramolecular comb-coil block copolymers formed by the stoichiometric complexation of two
amphiphilic surfactants, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) and 3-pentadecylphenol (PDP), with
the poly-(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) blocks in a linear PS-b-P4VP and a non-linear AnBn-type
hetero-arm star PS-P4VP copolymer have been investigated. All linear and hetero-arm star systems
under study exhibited lamellae-within-lamellae morphology even at high PS volume fraction, at
which the previously studied systems showed lamellae-within-cylinder or lamellae-within-sphere
morphology. The interlamellar distances of the larger-scale copolymer microdomains were found to
be much larger in all hetero-arm complexes than those in their linear counterparts. This was
attributed to the chain crowding effect coupled with the different types of arrangement of comb
blocks forming the smaller-scale lamellar mesophase. Moreover, the order-disorder transition
temperatures of both the larger-scale and the smaller-scale structures in the hetero-arm star systems
were higher than those associated with the linear diblocks due to the lower entropy of transition.
Introduction
Block copolymers constitute a special class of materials capable of self-assembling into a series
of long-range ordered nanostructures driven by the incompatibility between the covalently
connected blocks.1 Polymers with comb-shaped architecture also display the propensity to
self-organize due to the repulsion between the backbone and the short side chains.2 The covalent
bonds through which the side chains attach to the backbone may be replaced by the physical bonds
such as ionic bonds,3,4 hydrogen bonds5-7 or metal-mediated coordination bonds8-10 to yield the
“supramolecular comb polymers”, which may analogically self-organize to form mesomorphic
nanostructures.11,12
An even richer variety of ordered nanostructures can be formed if the comb architecture is
introduced into the block copolymer by selectively complexing one of the blocks in a coil-coil
diblock copolymer with a surfactant.13 The resultant “supramolecular comb-coil diblock
copolymer”displays two distinct levels of self-organization; one gives rise to the larger-length-scale
copolymer domain (typically of several tens of nanometers) driven by the microphase separation
between the comb and the coil blocks, and the other yields a smaller-length-scale lamellar structure
(with the interlamellar distance of several nanometers) due to the segregation between the polymer
backbone and the surfactant tails in the comb block. “Structure-within-structure”is an appropriate
term for describing such a morphological pattern. Moreover, due to the presence of two structure
units with different length scales, two order-disorder transition (ODT) temperatures (TODT) can be
defined for the comb-coil copolymers, namely, TODTL and TODTS corresponding to the TODT of the
larger-scale copolymer domain and the smaller-scale mesophase organized by the comb block,
respectively.14,15
The supramolecular comb-coil concept was pioneered and widely investigated by Ikkala and
32
PS-P2VP reported in our previous study.15 Two hetero-arm star copolymers were prepared and
denoted as H1 and H2. The detailed characteristics of the hetero-arm copolymers are also listed in
Table 1.
2. Complex Preparation. Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA, Acros, mixture of C10~C13
isomers) was used without further purification and 3-pentadecylphenol (PDP, Aldrich, tech. 90%)
was purified by recrystallization using petroleum ether. For the preparation of the complexes of the
copolymers with DBSA and PDP, the copolymers and surfactants were first dissolved separately in
chloroform to the concentration of 3 wt% to form clear solutions. The complexes were then
prepared by mixing appropriate quantity of the two solutions which would prescribe the
stoichiometric binding of the surfactants to P4VP block. Most of the solvent was evaporated at
room temperature. Finally, the samples were dried under vacuum at 60 oC for 48 h to remove the
residual solvent. All the complexes with DBSA were further annealed at 140oC for 48 hrs to
enhance the long-range order of the copolymer domains.
3. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) Measurements. The temperature-dependent SAXS
experiments in a heating cycle were conducted to probe the morphologies of the copolymers. The
samples were first equilibrated for 20 min followed by data acquisition for 1 h at each measuring
temperature under vacuum. The SAXS instrument was equipped with a 3.0 KW X-ray generator
operated at 40 KV x 35 mA (NANOSTAR, Bruker Co, Ltd.) and a two-dimensional
position-sensitive proportional counter with 512 x 512 channels. The Cu Kαline (λ= 0.154 nm) was
used. The intensity profile was output as the plot of the scattering intensity ( I ) vs. the scattering
vector, )2/sin()/4( q , where  is the scattering angle. All data were corrected by the
empty beam scattering, the sensitivity of each pixel of the area detector and thermal diffuse
scattering (TDS).
4. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) Observations. The real-space morphologies were
observed by a JEOL JEM-2000FXZ transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 100 kV.
The copolymer specimens were microtomed at -60 °C with a Reichert Ultracut E low-temperature
sectioning system. The microtomed sections were collected onto copper grids coated with
carbon-supporting films and then stained for 10 min in RuO4 vapor. Since RuO4 was a preferential
staining agent for PS, PS and P4VP-containing domains appeared as dark and bright regions in the
micrographs, respectively.
5. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Measurements. The phase transitions of PDP in the
complexes were investigated by a TA instrument 2000 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC).
The samples were heated from 30 °C to 100 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min.
Results
1. Comb-Coil Copolymers with Hydrogen-Bonding Complexation.

event was attributable to the transition from the mesophase to an isotropic phase, namely, the ODT
of the smaller-scale mesophase organized by the comb block (TODTS  71.2 °C). This temperature
coincided well with the first onset temperature at which the low-q peak intensity dropped obviously
(cf. Figure 1(c)). The remaining broad SAXS peak in the high-q region above 70 °C was considered
as the“corelation hole” peak reflecting the concentration fluctuations in the disordered comb block
microdomains.
Figure 1(c) also displays the change of the high-q peak intensity (Im(S)) with temperature above
70 oC. Im(S) was found to decrease monotonically with increasing temperature, but a steeper drop
was identified above 110 °C, which lied closely to TODTL. We considered this temperature as the one
at which the detached PDP molecules (due to breakage of hydrogen bonds) in the disordered comb
block domains started to diffuse into the PS domains, which eventually homogenized the whole
system.
Figure 4 shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of L1(PDP) system obtained during
subsequent cooling experiment from 200oC to 30oC. The re-appearance of scattering peaks at both
low- and high-q region during cooling showed that the structural features described above were
thermally reversible. The thermal reversibility observed also showed that the sample was thermally
stable under the experimental condition employed for the SAXS experiments.
B. H1(PDP) system. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of
H1(PDP) system. The scattering curves at low temperatures showed a primary maximum at 0.21
nm-1 and two weak higher-order peaks at 0.42 and 0.66 nm-1. Another peak with strong intensity
was observed in the high-q region at 1.62 nm-1. Similarly, the SAXS peaks in the low-q region were
attributed to the larger-scale copolymer domain structure. The integral ratio of the peak positions
signaled the formation of a lamellar morphology with the interlamellar distance D = 29.92 nm
consisting of alternating PS and P4VP(PDP) layers. This morphology was expected considering the
rather symmetric composition of the comb-coil copolymer ( PSf = 0.45).
The high-q peak at 1.62 nm-1 stemmed from the smaller-scale lamellar mesophase formed by
P4VP(PDP) combs with d = 3.9 nm. Hence, H1(PDP) system also self-organized into a
lamellae-within-lamellae morphology. Upon heating to 80 °C, the intensity of the high-q peak
dropped sharply (cf. Im-1(S) vs. T-1 plot in Figure 5(c)) coupled with peak broadening, signaling that
the lamellar mesophase underwent an ODT (i.e. TODTs  80 oC). This ODT event was confirmed
by the DSC thermogram in Figure 3, showing a small endotherm at 79.7 °C due to the transition
from the mesophase to the isotropic phase for the P4VP(PDP) comb blocks. The DSC thermogram
also showed a larger endotherm (ΔHt ~ 10 J/g ) at 21.2 oC, which was attributed to the melting of
PDP crystallites. It should however be noted that the PDP crystallites in this system completely
melted below 30 oC and hence the SAXS profile collected at the lowest temperature in Figure 5(a),
i.e., 40 oC, did not show the sharp peak associated with the PDP crystallites superposing on the
broader peak in the high-q region.
As can be seen in Figure 5(c), Im(L) did not show any abrupt decrease up to 170 oC and hence the
larger-scale copolymer domains were stable up to at least 170 °C (i.e. TODTL >170 oC). The SAXS
36
described below, a sharp drop in intensity of this peak was observed near 220 oC, showing that an
ODT of the smaller-scale structure existed in this sample near this temperature (also see Supporting
Information). Such a discontinuous drop in intensity was not prescribed for a correlation hole peak.
Figure 8(b) presents the Im-1 vs T-1 plots for the primary scattering maxima associated with the
larger-scale and the smaller-scale structures. Abrupt drops of intensities were identified near 220 °C
in both cases, indicating that the disordering of the larger-scale lamellar structure (ODTL) occurred
almost concurrently with that of the smaller-scale mesophase (ODTS), that is, TODTLTODTS220
°C. In this case, the occurrence of ODTL induced the mixing between the coil and comb blocks, and
hence disrupted the smaller-scale structure simultaneously.
Figure 9 shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of L2(DBSA) obtained during
subsequent cooling from 260 oC to 30 oC. The scattering peaks at both low- and high-q region
re-appeared during cooling, which showed that the structural features described above were
thermally reversible.
D. H2(DBSA) system. Figure 10(a) shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of
H2(DBSA). The scattering pattern showed a primary maximum associated with the larger-scale
structure at 0.22 nm-1 and another strong peak of the smaller-scale mesophase at 2.33 nm-1. The
inset shows the Lorentz-corrected Iq2 vs. q plot at 30 °C in the low-q region. It can be seen that a
weak second-order peak became visible, which signaled that the system formed a larger-scale
lamellar morphology with D  28.56 nm. This was further corroborrated from the SAXS data
obtained using a synchrotron radiation facility (cf. Supporting Information). Consequently,
H2(DBSA) also exhibited the lamellae-within-lamellae morphology. Again, it was rather
unexpected that H2(DBSA) with PSf = 0.75 could self-organize into a larger-scale lamellar
morphology. Another interesting feature worth noting was that though H2(DBSA) displayed a less
ordered larger-scale lamellar structure than L2(DBSA), its smaller-scale mesophase was more
ordered as demonstrated by a sharper high-q peak.
Figure 10(b) shows the corresponding Im(L)-1 and Im(S)-1 vs. T-1 plots. Although Im(L) and Im(S)
decreased above 200 °C, the intensity changes were indeed small comparing with those found in
Figure 7(b) for L2(DBSA). Consequently, we concluded that the morphology of H2(DBSA) was
much more stable than that of L2(DBSA), as the ODTs were not accessible up to 260 °C. This
result was again consistent with our previous study, showing that the order-disorder transition
temperatures of the comb-coil copolymer with star architecture were higher than those of the linear
counterparts.
Table 2 summarizes the morphological parameters and TODTs of the six systems studied. All
copolymers were found to display lamellae-within-lamellae morphology.
Discussion
A. L1(PDP) versus H1(PDP). The molecular weight and the composition of L1 and H1 were very
similar. Therefore, a close comparison between the self-assembly behavior of L1(PDP) and
H1(PDP) would allow the molecular architecture effect on the hydrogen-bonded systems to be
38
and 0.76 were found to display lamellae-within-cylinder or the lamellae-within-sphere morphology,
namely, the comb block formed cylindrical or spherical microdomains dispersed in the PS matrix.
Due to the same kind of block copolymer being used, the unexpected lamellae-within-lamellae
morphology of L2(DBSA) was attributed to the very short P4VP blocks (Mn = 1290) in the
PS-b-P4VP used here. To form a lamellae-within-cylinder or lamellae-within-sphere morphology,
the P4VP(DBSA) comb block needs to form large microdomains so as to reduce the interfacial
curvature for the regular stacking of the smaller-scale lamellae. However, large microdomains could
not be formed by the very short P4VP block; therefore, lamellar microdomain becomes the
favorable structure for enhancing the stacking of the smaller-scale lamellae.
Additionally, as compared to hydrogen-bonded systems (P4VP(PDP) or P4VP(NDP))
investigated previously with the same composition, the DBSA was strongly ionically bound to
P4VP in the present systems. In this case, we were dealing with a densely grafted P4VP brush
which required a higher interfacial area then the hydrogen-bonded P4VP chains.44 Thus, a
lamellar morphology was more plausible for the present system despite compositional asymmetry.
D. Interdomain Distances of the Larger-Scale Structures. It is clear from Table 2 that the
interlamellar distance of the larger-scale lamellar structure formed by the copolymer domains (D)
was larger for the hetero-arm star systems than that of their linear counterparts, irrespective of the
strength of the surfactant binding. In our previous study of the comb-coil copolymers displaying
cylinder-within-lamellae structure, the domain spacing of the larger-scale structure was found to be
smaller in hetero-arm star copolymers.15 The smaller D in star system was attributed to the lower
aggregation number of the PS blocks within the cylindrical microdomains due to its peculiar
architecture. This finding was different from the previous studies of coil-coil block copolymers26-30
showing that the star copolymers exhibited a larger domain spacing than the corresponding linear
diblock, because the arm crowding near the junction points resulted in strong chain stretching.
However, the difference in D found for coil-coil systems was typically less than 15%, but for the
present comb-coil systems showing lamellae-within-lamellae morphology the difference was 40-76
%. Therefore, the anomalously large D must be caused by other factors.
We propose that the key factor governing the interlamellar distance is the arrangement of the
comb blocks forming the smaller-scale lamellar mesophase. Figure 11 shows two possible types
of arrangement, i.e., mono-layer (ML) and double-layer (DL), of the P4VP(PDP) or P4VP(DBSA)
combs in both linear diblock and hetero-arm star copolymers. The interlamellar distance
associated with the DL arrangement is apparently larger. We propose that the comb blocks in the
star copolymer complexes adopted DL arrangement, whereas those in the linear systems organized
in ML. The advantage of adopting ML arrangement was that the PS blocks could acquire more
space to relax because one longer PS block shared the same cross section with two relatively short
P4VP(DBSA) combs blocks. The relaxation of PS conformation was entropically favored but this
led to the larger interfacial energy due to the larger cross sectional area. On the contrary, the DL
arrangement caused the PS blocks to stretch significantly while lowered the interfacial energy of the
system. In the case of hetero-arm star copolymer complex, the effect of entropy may be intrinsically
40
displayed higher TODTL and TODTS than the linear complexes, irrespective of the binding force of the
surfactant to the P4VP block, because of the lower entropy change associated with the ODTs.

III. Tetragonally Packed Cylinder Structure via Hierarchical Assembly of Comb-Coil Diblock
Copolymer
Abstract
Block copolymers constitute an important class of soft material capable of self-assembling into
nanoscale microdomains with well-defined geometries. The cylindrical domains thus formed have
been found to pack almost exclusively in hexagonal lattice. In this study, we disclose how the
mesomorphic molecular order can mediate the packing symmetry to generate an anomalous
tetragonal lattice in a diblock copolymer composing of a coil and a supramolecular comb block.
This system displays a hierarchical structure in which the larger-scale cylinders formed by the coil
blocks are embedded in a liquid crystalline matrix composing of a smaller-scale lamellar structure
organized by the comb blocks. The cylinders are found to pack in either the typical hexagonal
lattice or the tetragonal lattice governed by the orientation of the lamellae with respect to the
cylinder prescribed by the overall grafting density of the comb blocks.
Introduction
Self-assembly of soft matter is one of the most effective approaches for constructing
nanostructures with controllable order. Many of these structures are mesomorphic, characterized by
certain degrees of orientational or positional order at one or multiple length scales coupled with the
dynamic spectrum over a broad range of time scale1. Soft matter has been considered as a key
element for producing the newest generation of smart and functional materials; therefore, the
development of the fundamental basis for engineering its self-assembly behavior is an essential step
toward nanoscale regulation of structure and functioning.
Block copolymers composing of two or more covalently connected chains per molecule
constitute an important class of soft material capable of self-assembling into a rich variety of
nanostructures2,3. Two levels of structural organization can be recognized for block copolymer
self-assembly in the melt state. The first level is the microphase separation between the repulsive
dissimilar blocks, which generates micelle composing of the microdomain (core) and the corona
formed by the respective blocks. The geometry of the microdomain thus formed includes lamellae,
cylinder and sphere depending on the interfacial tension at domain interface and the conformational
entropy of the block chains3,4. The second level involves the spatial organization of the micelles,
which results in long-range ordered packing of the microdomains with the lattice symmetry
governed by the domain geometry and the degree of deformation of the micelle corona for space
filling. The lattice with minimum corona deformation is normally favored4.
The cylindrical microdomains formed by block copolymers have been found to organize almost
exclusively in hexagonal lattice. Hexagonal packing is indeed the predominant structure among
the materials composing of cylindrical supramolecular building blocks. Tetragonal lattice is
another type of packing symmetry which may be observed under the regulation of some special
56
synthesized by sequential anionic polymerizations of styrene and 4-vinyl pyridine were acquired
from Polymer Source, Inc. The number average molecular weights of PS and P4VP blocks in the
former are 12000 and 11800, respectively, whereas those in the later are 50,000 and 49,800,
respectively. The polydispersity indices of both samples are 1.05. The surfactant DBSA (soft
type) was obtained from Tokio Kasei, Tokyo, Japan. This material had the purity of 90 %, and the
remaining impurity consisted of different chain lengths and branches:
(CnH2n+1)(CmH2m+1)CHPhSO3H, with n+m+1=10,…14. It was dried in vacuo at 60 oC for 12 h
before use.
Preparation of Comb-Coil Diblock Copolymers. PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) comb-coil copolymers were
prepared by dissolving preweighed PS-b-P4VP and DBSA in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
followed by evaporating most solvent at ca. 60 oC. The samples were finally dried in vacuo at 100
oC for 12 hrs to remove the residual solvent. The overall binding fraction of DBSA to P4VP block
is denoted by x, which expresses the average number of DBSA molecules bound with a 4VP
monomer unit prescribed by the feed ratio of DBSA and P4VP block in the copolymers. The
comb-coil copolymers with x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.75 and 1.0 are prepared here, as they all display
cylinder-within-lamellae morphology. The volume fraction of PS block ranges from 0.19 to 0.28
depending on x (cf. Table 1). For the SAXS and TEM experiments, the samples were further
annealed at 150 oC in vacuum for 30 hrs prior to the measurements.
Large-Amplitude Oscillatory Shear Experiment. Large-amplitude oscillating shear was
performed to produce large-scale alignment of the microdomains in the samples with x = 1.0 and
0.5. The shear was carried out with a Linkam CSS 450 shear hot stage in the oscillatory mode
with the shear frequency of 0.1 Hz and the strain amplitude of 50 %. The sample was first sheared
at 135oC for 1h followed by cooling to 35 oC at 2oC/min.
Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) Measurements. SAXS measurements were performed
using a Bruker Nanostar SAXS instrument. The X-ray source, a 1.5 KW X-ray generator
(Kristalloflex 760) equipped with a Cu tube, was operated at 35 mA and 40 KV. The scattering
intensities and patterns were detected by a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector (Bruker
AXS) with 512 × 512 channels. The area scattering patterns of the isotropic samples have been
radially averaged to generate the intensity profiles output as the plots of the scattering intensity (I)
vs. the scattering vector, q = 4π/λsin(θ/2) (θ =scattering angle). The scattering intensities have
been corrected by the empty beam scattering and the sensitivity of each pixel of the area detector.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Experiment. The real-space morphology of
PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) was observed by a JEM-2000EX II transmission electron microscope operated
at 100 KV. The film specimens were microtomed at -50 °C using a Reichert Ultracut E
low-temperature sectioning system. The ultrathin sections were picked onto the copper grids
coated with carbon-supporting films followed by staining by exposure to iodine vapor for 30 h.
58
4.98/qmi=1 is 7.8 nm24.
The copolymer with x = 0.5 exhibits a different scattering pattern. Here a scattering peak
situating at ca. 0.4 nm-1 emerges as a shoulder of the primary peak prescribing the domain spacing
of 25.5 nm. The positions of the peaks now follow the ratio of 1: 21/2: 41/2: 51/2. The 21/2 and 51/2
peaks are not consistent with any diffraction order from the hexagonal lattice; a tetragonal or square
lattice can however give rise to these diffraction peaks arising from the (11) and (21) planes23. The
radius of the cylinder deduced from the position of the first form factor maximum is 6.5 nm. The
scattering pattern remains unperturbed upon heating to 200 oC, indicating that the tetragonal lattice
is thermally stable (cf. Supporting Information).
Two-dimensional (2-D) SAXS patterns are further obtained using the samples with large-scale
alignment of the microdomains produced by large-amplitude oscillating shear. The
“through-view” and the “edge-view” patern are obtained by the incident X-ray traveling parallel
and perpendicular to the shear flow direction (i.e. z axis), respectively. Figure 5(a) shows the 2-D
SAXS patterns of the system with x = 1.0. The through-view pattern displays six spots from the
(10) planes, indicating that the PS cylinders are aligned in the flow direction and pack with
hexagonal symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the flow direction. The edge-view pattern
exhibits two arcs at the equator arising from the (10) planes. Two additional arcs associated with
the lamellar stacks formed by the comb blocks are identified in the outer region of this 2-D pattern.
The fact that these two arcs are located in the meridian indicates that the lamellar interface lies
perpendicularly to the cylinder axis, giving rise to the orthogonal orientation as illustrated in Figure
5(b)18,25.
Figure 6(a) displays the 2-D SAXS patterns of the copolymer with x = 0.5. Tetragonal packing of
the PS cylinders is clearly evidenced by the through-view pattern showing four diffraction spots
from the (10) planes in the four quadrants. The smaller-scale lamellar structure gives rise to a
diffuse ring in the through-view pattern and two spots in the meridian of the edge-view pattern.
Most interestingly, the (10) reflections from the PS cylinders in the edge-view pattern are also
located in the meridian, which means that the cylinders and the P4VP(DBSA) lamellae do not
display the orthogonal orientation found for x = 1.0. We propose that the DBSA side chains on the
comb blocks lie flatly on the plane of the cylinder cross section (i.e. the xy plane), leading to
lamellar stacking (and hence an electron density modulation) around the cylinders in the through
view, as schematically illustrated in Figure 6(b). Such a peculiar edge-on lamellar organization
yields a ring in the through-view scattering pattern. In the edge view the normals of the lamellae
attached to the lateral sides of the cylinders (i.e. those enclosed by the dashed region in Figure 6(b))
orient relatively perpendicular to the cylinder axis, and hence results in two spots in the meridian of
the corresponding SAXS pattern.
The SAXS result reveals an interesting connection between the packing lattice and the orientation
60
Conclusions
We have shown that the hierarchical assembly of a comb-coil diblock copolymer system
generates hexagonally or tetragonally packed cylinders embedded in the lamellar mesophase
organized by the comb blocks. The packing symmetry is determined by the orientation of the
lamellae with respect to the cylindrical domains prescribed by the overall grafting density of the
comb blocks. Hexagonal lattice is favored for the orthogonal orientation, while tetragonal packing
becomes the stable structure when the lamellae adopt the edge-on arrangement. The main
difference between the present system and the conventional coil-coil diblock copolymers lies in the
molecular order of the matrix phase, where the cylindrical domains here are embedded in a liquid
crystalline matrix rather than a disordered liquid phase. The exploitation of liquid crystallinity is
an effective approach for expanding the morphological window of block copolymers. In particular,
various novel microdomain structures, including wavy lamellae29, zigzag lamellae30 and arrowhead
domains29, have been created through the modification of interfacial curvature by the liquid
crystalline order. The present work along with the previous ones13,14 attest that the lattice structure
can also be modified by the liquid crystalline order. Comparing with the liquid crystalline rod-coil
diblock copolymers, the comb-coil system may exhibit more versatile structure variation due to the
adjustable mesomorphic order or liquid crystallinity of the comb blocks by the grafting density.
This is demonstrated by the accessibility of both hexagonal and tetragonal lattices in a single
PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) system with different binding fractions.

This comb-coil diblock was formed by the selective complexation of the poly(4-vinylpyridine)
(P4VP) block in a linear PS-b-P4VP with the surfactant, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA).
The copolymer self-assembled into the cylinder-within-lamellae structure,5 in which the PS
cylinders were embedded in the matrix composing of the lamellar mesophase organized by the
comb block. The cylindrical microdomains were found to pack in the typical hexagonal lattice when
the overall grafting density of the comb block approached the stoichiometric value; however,
tetragonal packing became the stable structure at the intermediate binding fraction of DBSA to
P4VP block.4 The packing symmetry was further found to be governed by the orientation of the
smaller-scale lamellae with respect to the larger-scale PS cylinders. Hexagonal lattice was favored
when the two entities showed the “orthogonal orientation”, where the smaller-scale lamellae
stacked along the cylinder axis; on the other hand, the “edge-on arrangement”of the smaller-scale
lamellae, where the side chains of the comb blocks lay flatly on the plane of the cylinder cross
section, induced tetragonal packing of the cylinders.
Our other studies of comb-coil block copolymers6-8 have revealed that the molecular
architecture could affect their self-organization behavior in terms of the domain spacing and the
relevant order-disorder transition temperatures. For instance, the order-disorder transition
temperatures associated with the structures at both length scales increased significantly in the
hetero-arm star comb-coil copolymers compared with their linear counterparts.7,8 In this study, we
are interested in exploring if the unusual tetragonally-packed cylinder structure is also accessible for
the comb-coil copolymer bearing hetero-arm star architecture. Here we prepare the hetero-arm
comb-coil copolymer by selective complexation of DBSA with the P4VP block in a PSn-P4VPn
hetero-arm star copolymer. It will be shown that the PS cylindrical domains in the copolymer with
stoichiometric surfactant binding in the comb block display hexagonal packing, while those in the
system with the overall binding fraction of 0.4 organize into a tetragonal lattice. The difference in
packing symmetry is also found to stem from the different relative orientation of the two structural
entities with different length scales.
Experiment Section
The hetero-arm star PSn-P4VPn, with the average arm number n of both PS and P4VP blocks
being 2.6, was prepared by a three-step sequential copolymerization.7 The number-average
molecular weights of PS and P4VP blocks were both 8800 and the polydispersity index of the
copolymer was 1.27.
The complexes of the copolymer with DBSA (Acros, mixture of C10~C13 isomers) were
prepared according to the procedure described previously.4 The overall binding fraction of DBSA
on P4VP block is denoted by x, which expresses the average number of DBSA molecules bound
with a 4VP monomer unit prescribed by the feed ratio of DBSA and P4VP block in the copolymer.
The comb-coil copolymers with x = 0.4 and 1.0 were prepared here, as they both displayed
cylinder-within-lamellae morphology. The corresponding volume fraction of PS block (fPS) is 0.31
72
shows the coexistence of the images of striation and dark circles/ellipsoids corresponding to the side
view and the top view of cylinders, respectively, which confirms that the PS domains are indeed
cylinder in shape. The tetragonal organization can be demonstrated clearly from the cross-section
image of the PS cylinders in the main body of the micrograph, which yields the four-fold symmetry
in the corresponding Fourier-transform pattern (cf. the upper left inset).
Both the SAXS and TEM results have revealed that the hetero-arm PS-P4VP(DBSA)
comb-coil copolymer exhibits the same self-assembly behavior as its linear counterpart in terms of
the effect of the overall binding fraction of comb block on the packing symmetry of the PS
cylinders. For the system with stoichiometric binding the cylindrical domains pack into a
hexagonal lattice whereas for the intermediate binding fraction (i.e. x = 0.4) the cylinders arrange in
a tetragonal lattice. Using the linear PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) with large-scale alignment of the
microdomains, we have demonstrated previously that the systems with high and intermediate
binding fractions showed different orientation of the smaller-scale lamellae with respect to the
larger-scale PS cylinder, and such a difference led to contrasting packing lattices of the cylindrical
domains.4 Two types of relative orientation were identified in the previous study, namely, the
orthogonal orientation and the edge-on arrangement of the smaller-scale lamellae, as schematically
illustrated in Figure 3. These orientations can be distinguished from the SAXS 2-D pattern
obtained with the incident X-ray traveling perpendicular to the cylinder axis (called the“edge-view
pattern”). For the orthogonal orientation, the smaller-scale lamellae stack along the long axis of the
cylinder (i.e., z axis); in this case, the side chains of the comb blocks tend to align along the z axis,
such that the lamellar interface lies perpendicularly to the cylinder axis, as shown in Figure 3(a).
The corresponding edge-view SAXS pattern contains a pair of inner arcs associated with the (10)
plane of the cylinder lattice at the equator and another pair of outer arc due to the (001) diffraction
of the smaller-scale lamellae at the meridian, or vice versa. For the edge-on arrangement of the
smaller-scale lamellae, the side chains of the comb blocks tend to lie flatly on the plane of the
cylinder cross section (i.e. the xy plane), as schematically illustrated in Figure 3(b). In the edge
view, the normals to the interfaces of the lamellae attached to the lateral sides of the cylinders
orient relatively perpendicular to the z axis, and hence results in two outer arcs located at the same
direction as the inner arcs in the corresponding edge-view pattern. It was found previously that the
PS cylinders packed in a hexagonal latice when the two structural entities exhibited the “orthogonal 
orientation”, while the edge-on arrangement of the smaller-scale lamellae induced tetragonal
packing.4
Figure 4 shows the edge-view SAXS patterns of the two hetero-arm star copolymers after
subjecting to the large-amplitude oscillating shear treatment. For the system with x = 1.0 where
the PS cylinders packed in hexagonal lattice, the locations of the two pairs of arcs are perpendicular
to each other (Figure 4(a)), signaling that the two structural entities adopt the orthogonal orientation
as that found for its linear counterpart. On the other hand, the arcs associated with the PS
cylinders and the P4VP(DBSA) lamellae are both located at the equator for the copolymer with x =
74
appeared at the intermediate binding fraction of DBSA on P4VP block, where the smaller-scale
lamellae adopted the edge-on arrangement with respect to the cylinder axis. The hexagonal
packing became stable at the stoichiometric binding that resulted in the orthogonal orientation of the
smaller-scale lamellae with respect to the PS cylinder. The present result along with the previous
one for the linear systems has thus demonstrated that the self-organization behavior in terms of the
packing symmetry and the relative orientation of the two structural entities is essentially
independent of the molecular architecture for the comb-coil copolymers.

Thomas Russell，Prof. Gert Srobl 和 MIT 材料所所長 Prof. Edwin Thomas 等等，
在這八個會議議程當中，除了各國的學者陸續發表他們在高分子結晶方面的最新
研究成果之外，該主題也舉辦了不少場的座談，來檢視並討論高分子結晶的過去
與現在，同時討論未來結晶性高分子的發展、機會和挑戰，因此學者不僅僅只是
提出自己最新在高分子學術上的研究成果以及各種商業發展價值，而是更深一層
的去討論、瞭解高分子這門科學的基礎與其真正的價值，他們甚至於 08/20 下午
特別安排了一個時段，讓各國的學者，對於”如何從教育上改革讓下一個世代去
學習及認知高分子這方面”的議題去做討論，此討論過程中，不但涉及了在未來，
高分子的研究如何才能夠受到更多人的注意及重視，甚至針對是否要在大學部就
開設高分子學系進行了議論，雖然各國學者對於這些問題都有不同的看法，但大
家的出發點卻都是同樣的，希望高分子能夠越來越蓬勃發展，希望大家都知道高
分子這個的物質是多麼地奇妙、美麗，多麼地有價值，也讓更多人都能真正融入
這門科學，經過幾天的討論，各國的學者為未來幾年高分子的研究發展重點提供
一個清晰的藍圖，也讓學生領悟不少，高分子這門科學，早已經不再只是一門應
用科學或一門延伸的科學，它早該被歸類為基礎科學，因為，世界上有多少的研
樣的結果？如果改變某些變因（例如改變膜厚、改變基板的特性…等等），是不
是又會有不同的結果？有問題才有研究改良的價值，問題越多，才越能激起學者
們的企圖心，而且，同樣一種物質，為何在不同尺度就有不同的行為，這是相當
有趣的課題，因此，這個研究會越來越多人投入，也不是沒有原因的。  
如果沒有意外，往後，學生的研究，也將與高分子在薄膜中的特性有關，主
要將研究 Block copolymer 在薄膜中，會有什麼不同的相行為，在已知塊材行為
的前提下，比較當其以薄膜方式存在時，會有什麼不同的行為。因此這次參加會
議學生也聽了許多跟薄膜有關的演講，其中最有印象的幾個，如下： 
A. P. Marencic 在”New Concepts in Polymeric Materials Advanced Materials”主
題中所報告的”Limitation of order in sphere-forming block copolymer thin films 
aligned under shear”，其研究主要是先將 PS-block-poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) 
spin coating 在 Si Wafer 上，再利用 shear 的方式去改善其結構，利用 Tapping-Mode 
Atomic Force Microscope 來檢視薄膜在 real space 的結構，研究發現當被於現在
薄膜中時，其 microdomain 可以以不同的 conformation 存在，且 grain boundaries
會隨著 shear stress的增加而減少，另外，在經過 align的 sample中只會出現 isolated 
dislocation。 
K. J. Alvine 在”New Concepts in Polymeric Materials Advanced Materials”主題
中所報告的 ” Thermal stability and relaxation of polymeric nanoimprinted 
structures.”，其也是藉由 AFM 來觀察薄膜的變化，只是這個薄膜是比較特別的
是由 NanoImprint 製造的，主要是在探討 NanoImprinted (NIP) structure 之穩定性
以及影響其穩定性的因素，如 Lateral Instabilities 會隨著 Annealing 時間變長而
增加，另外，在溫度改變時，也可能會影響其原本的結構…等等，這個 NIP 技
術在學生往後的研究中，也將被使用，所以能夠在這裡獲得這方面的研究經驗與
成果，真的非常幸運。 
    最後，當然是最令學生覺得受益良多的，就是學生在 8/21 中在 Polymer 的
poster session 發表一篇研究，” Supramolecular Structures, crystallization kinetics, 
and Photophysical Properties of DTEO-alt-PV”。本篇研究主要即針對 DTEO-alt-PV
這個高分子的結構解析，以及結構跟光物理性質的一些關連，經研究後發現，此
高分子 DTEO-alt-PV 是一個半結晶性的高分子，在某些條件下，其會形成一個
很明顯的結晶相，且此結晶相屬於一種單斜晶系，該非直角之夾角(　)約為
103o，另外，為了更瞭解這個高分子，我們也進行了其結晶動力學的研究。在
Poster session 上，雖然沒有很多人問問題，但是有些人給予了一些不同的看法，
儘管跟學生自己的想法不同，但卻提供了學生不同的思維模式，學生將更進一步
思考這些問題，以提出一個更能夠讓人接受的結果。 
 
三、心得與建議事項 
    能夠有機會參加這樣盛大的國際會議，真的是學生的榮幸，再一次感謝國科
比，一天比一天進步，一年比一年更厲害，繼續突顯我們在國際上的重要性，增
加台灣的價值，再一次讓世界驚豔，再一次讓世人直呼不可思議，這應該是我們
這一代，現在最急迫應該做的事。
