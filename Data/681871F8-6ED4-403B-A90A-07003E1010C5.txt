Mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) is an important indicator for the resolution.  Keeping 
MEEF smaller is quite critical. 
 
 
II. Experimental  
Prolith version 9.0 from KLA-Tencor USA was used for simulation studies. 
The required transmittance and phase change of ASBs were decided based on simulation studies.  
The film compositions and thickness of ASBs which meet the requirements were calculated through 
website of Prof. B. W. Smith of RIT, USA. 
Two new types of PSMs firstly reported by our lab which are named attenuated-rim-outrigger and 
attenuated-rim respectively were used in this study for the fabrication of 2-D 45 nm contact hole mainly 
as shown in figure 1. 
Taguchi Genichi（田口玄一）Design of Experiment (DOE) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were 
generally applied to evaluate the optimizations of many optical parameters, however, due to the change of 
focus from optimizations of optical parameters to effects of keeping same exposure dose for varied 
pitches for both contact hole and line in this study, DOE and ANOVA were not used to simplify the study. 
 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
There are many optical combinations for lithographic studies, and each combination has many 
optical parameters needed to be tested, such as inner sigma and outer sigma for annular off-axis 
illumination, NA for immersion (range 1.0 to 1.44), transmittance for Att-PSM, width, location, 
transmittance and relative phase change for ASBs.  It is impossible and unrealistic to test all the 
combinations and parameters thoroughly. 
Hundreds of simulations were completed, for simplification, only two figures were reported here as 
shown in figure 2 and 3. 
In general, the required DOF can be set around 3 times of resolution node.  For example, 100 nm 
for 32 nm line, 135 nm for 45 nm contact hole.  Any pitch which has less DOF than required DOF, is 
defined as forbidden pitch. 
Mask enhancer (ME) which was reported few years ago is an excellent mask for the fabrication of 
contact hole [1-2].  The application and effect between ME and attenuated-rim-outrigger and 
attenuated-rim were compared.  Under specific lithographic combination and conditions, 
attenuated-rim-outrigger showed better resolution and greater DOF for 45 nm contact hole.  Most 
forbidden pitches can be eliminated by using attenuated-rim-outrigger but not ME. 
Finally, according to the calculations from Prof. Smith’s website, several film compositions can meet 
the required properties for new mask and one specific ASB (not for all ASBs), for example, SiNxOy.is one 
of the suitable compositions.
