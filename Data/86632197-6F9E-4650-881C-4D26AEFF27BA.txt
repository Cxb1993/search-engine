2processing and forming capabilities of
magnesium alloys are generally fairly poor.
Alloying Mg with the lightest metal
element, lithium, whose density is 0.534
g/cm3, yields a Magnesium-Lithium (Mg-Li)
alloy with a density similar to that of plastics,
and which has only half the density of
aluminum alloys. The Mg-Li phase diagram
[4] indicates that when the Li content is
between ~5.5 and 11.5 wt%, the
BCC-structured β phase of the Li solid 
solution co-exists with the HCP α phase of 
the Mg solid solution. The β single phase
structure could exist for Li contents greater
than 11 wt%. As the amount of Li added to
the Mg-Li alloy increases, the αphase still
possesses HCP structure, but the crystal
lattice axes ratio, c/a decreases such that slip
between crystal planes become less difficult
[5]. The co-existence of the phase makes
the Mg-Li alloy possible to be cold-worked.
The alloy design and mechanical
properties of Mg-Li alloys have long been
investigated [6-13]. However, the correlation
between mechanical properties and
formability of Mg-Li alloys has less been
examined [6,14], though it is important to
the practical use of Mg-Li alloys. In order to
examine the possibility of the practical use
of Mg-Li alloys, uniaxial tension tests and
press-forming tests were performed to
explore the mechanical properties,
anisotropic behavior and formability of
Mg-Li-Zn alloy thin sheets with two
different Li contents in the present work.
2. Materials and Experimental Procedures
2.1 Sheet preparation
The Mg-Li alloys were melted in a
high-vacuum electric induction furnace
under an argon atmosphere. The analyzed
chemical compositions of the cast alloys
were (wt%) Mg-9.2Li-0.47Zn (designated as
LZ90) and Mg-5.8Li-0.46Zn (designated as
LZ60). The 200 mm cast cylindrical billets
were extruded to a plate with a thickness of
5 mm at a billet preheating temperature of
200C, and the plates were then cold rolled
to a thickness of 0.6 mm.
2.2. Tensile Tests
Uniaxial tension tests were carried out in
the directions of 0, 45 and 90to the rolling
direction. The gauge length and width of the
tensile specimens were 50 and 6 mm,
respectively. The specimens were deformed
at room temperature with an initial crosshead
speed of 3 mm/min.
The normal anisotropy or average plastic
strain ratio ( r ) and the planer anisotropy (r)
were calculated from the r-values (r is the
plastic strain ratio which is the ratio of the
width strain to the thickness strain)
determined along three directions namely
parallel (0◦), diagonal (45◦) and
perpendicular (90◦) to the rolling direction
using the following expressions [15]:

2.3 Press-forming tests
The sheet length for press forming test to
determine the FLD was 80 mm with various
width. Decreasing the width from 80 to 10
mm causes change in the state of strain from
near balanced-biaxial tension through plane
strain to uniaxial-tension. The punch speed
was kept constant at 6 mm/min during the
tests. Grid circles of diameter do (2.5 mm)
etched on the sheets were used to measure
strain levels in each test. During forming the
etched circles were distorted into ellipses
and/or larger circles, and these deformed
grid circles were then used to measure strain
levels in each case. Measurements of the
major (d1) and minor (d2) diameters of the
deformed circles after deformation were
made to determine the major true strains (ε1)
and the minor true strains (ε2). The major
strains and the minor strains can then be
expressed as:

exhibit fibrous rolling texture, which is
typical plastically deformed structure.
phase in the LZ60 alloy presents elongated
fine strips and dispersed particles in the 
matrix, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The
morphology of most phase presented in
the LZ90 alloy is coarse long strip, as shown
in Fig. 2(b).
3.2 Tensile properties
Fig. 3 demonstrates the true stress-strain
curves of the LZ60 and LZ90 alloy in the
directions of 0, 45 and 90to the rolling
direction obtained from the uniaxial tension
tests with an initial strain rate of 1.6710-3
s-1. The tensile tests were performed on three
samples for each direction. The values of the
tensile properties for each direction are given
in Tables 1 and 2 for the LZ60 and
LZ90alloy, respectively. The average values
of the strengths, elongation, working
hardening exponent are evaluated as [15]

where X is yield strength or ultimate tensile
strength, or elongat ion, or working

were observed in the 90direction for both
alloys. The elongations in the 45direction
are greater than those in the other directions.
The work hardening exponents, n, (in the
approximation of nK ), are minima for
90direction to the rolling direction and

LZ60 alloy, (b) LZ90 alloy
present good drawability, in agreement with
the low value of LDR. For the near plane
strain condition (minor strain = 0), the
maximum fracture strain presented a rather
low value of about 2.07% only.
In tension-tension region the limiting
fracture strains for the LZ90 alloy are higher
than those of the LZ60 alloy. The limiting
fracture major strain for LZ90 alloy is about
20.17% and the limiting minor strain is
about 17.2%. Although the average n value
of the LZ90 alloy is much smaller than that
of the LZ60 alloy, the greater elongation of
the LZ90 alloy gives it a higher
stretchability than that of the LZ60 alloy. In
tension-compression region, the maximum
major strain is about 42.2%, the minor strain
is about 20.4%. The LZ90 alloy shows
moderate drawability. For the near plane
strain condition, the maximum fracture
strain presented a low value of about 9.6%.
3.5 Fracture analysis
The SEM images were obtained for the
fracture surfaces of the press-forming tests.
The samples for SEM observation were cut
from the region closet to the origin of the
fracture. The various SEM images are
demonstrated in the Figs. 5 and 6 for
tension-compression and tension-tension
strain condition, respectively. For the blanks
subjected to tension-compression strain
condition, dimpled structure with some flat
planes was observed in the LZ60 alloy, as
shown in Fig. 5(a). This reveals that the
fracture is partly ductile and partly brittle
owing to the LZ60 alloy having the HCP 
phase matrix, but the ductile fracture is the
dominant mode. This result is in agreement
with the limiting strains in the
tension-compression region of the FLD.
Dimpled structure with irregular surface was
observed for the LZ90 alloy, as shown in
Fig. 5(b), this is the typical fracture surface
for ductile fracture.
For the blanks subjected to tension-
tension strain condition, the fracture of both
alloys appears to be partly ductile and partly
brittle, as shown in the Fig. 6, and the
evidence for the brittle fracture is more.
Some small voids were observed in the
LZ60 alloy, as given in Fig. 6(a). In the
