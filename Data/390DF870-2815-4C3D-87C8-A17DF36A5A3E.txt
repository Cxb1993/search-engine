ABSTRACT 
The research is aimed to investigate 
the mechanical behaviors of epoxy-based 
nanocomposites reinforced with 
spherical nanoparticles. Five different 
contents of silica nanoparticles—5, 10, 
15, 20, and 40 wt%—were introduced in 
the samples. Through a sol-gel technique, 
the silica particles with a diameter of 25 
nm were exfoliated uniformly in the 
epoxy matrix.  Experimental results 
obtained from tensile tests indicate that 
the Young’s modulus of nanocomposites 
increases with the increment of 
particulate inclusions, and the enhancing 
behavior is coincided with the model 
predictions obtained from the 
Mori-Tanaka micromechanical model.  
In addition, the fracture tests conducted 
on single-edge-notch bending specimens 
reveal that the inclusion of nanoparticles 
can effectively increase the fracture 
toughness of the nanocomposites. 
Furthermore, the extent of the 
enhancement is more appreciable in the 
brittle matrix system rather than in the 
ductile matrix system.

INTRODUCTION 
With extensive applications of 
polymer and its composites, the demand 
for materials that possess the 
characteristics of high stiffness and 
strength is increasing.  In order to 
improve mechanical properties, spherical 
particles have been used as reinforcement 
in polymeric materials for many years. In 
general, these composite materials were 
reinforced with micron-sized inclusions. 
However, with the advance of 
nanotechnology as well as the processing 
techniques, various types of particles 
with nano-scale have recently been 
developed and then utilized in 
conventional polymeric materials to form 
the nanocomposites.   
In order to disperse the 
nanoparticles into the polymer systems 
with efficiency, several techniques such 
as mechanical shearing [1, 2], 
 diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) 
resin, containing 40 wt% silica 
nanoparticles. Through sol-gel 
processing, the synthesized silica 
particles with diameters of around 25 nm 
were dispersed uniformly in DGEBA 
resin [6]. Two different curing agents 
were introduced in this study in an 
attempt to provide ductile and brittle 
epoxy matrixes in the nanocomposites. 
One is Jeffamine D-230 
(polyoxypropylenedi amine with a 
molecular weight of 230) provided by the 
Huntsman Corporation, and the other is 
H-100 (modified cycloaliphatic amine) 
provided by the Yun Teh Corporation of 
Taiwan. When the silica/epoxy 
nanocomposite samples with different 
particle contents were prepared, the 
Nanopox@ F400 resin was diluted at the 
beginning by adding a desired amount of 
DGEBA resin.  The mixture was then 
sonicated using a sonicator with cooling 
system around the sample container until 
the particles are displaced uniformly in 
the epoxy resin. The epoxy-silica mixture 
was degassed at room temperature in a 
vacuum oven for ten minutes and then 
mixed with the curing agent. The 
mechanical stirrer was utilized to blend 
the final mixture at room temperature for 
10 minutes. Again, the degassing process 
was conducted on the compound using a 
vacuum oven at 60˚C for an hour to 
remove the embedded bubbles generated 
during the mechanical mixing process.  
Afterward, the mixture was poured into 
the designed steel mold with Teflon 
coating on its surfaces to form the 
nanocomposite specimens. Subsequently, 
the samples were cured at 100˚C for 3 
hours with an additional 3 hours at 125˚C 
for post-curing. In the study, the 
nanocomposites containing 5%, 10%, 
15%, 20%, and 40% loadings (by weight) 
of silica particles were prepared, 
respectively. It is noted that when 
nanocomposites contain high silica 
nanoparticle loading, the viscosity 
becomes higher, possibly retarding the 
degassing process. In order to have high 
quality specimens, more degassing time 
is suggested during the sample 
preparation.  
 
MATERIAL 
CHARACTERIZATION 
In order to evaluate the quality of 
exfoliation of the silica in the epoxy resin, 
the samples were examined using 
Transmission Electron Microscope 
(TEM), which is a widespread method 
for providing direct visualization on the 
spatial distribution of the nanoparticles as 
well as for characterizing the 
microstructures of particulate 
nanocomposites. Thin film samples of 
epoxy-silica nanocomposites with 
15%wt and 40 wt% silica particles (about 
70 nm thick) were cut from the 
specimens, respectively, using a 
Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome, and 
the associated morphology were imaged 
using a JEOL 200CX transmission 
electron microscope at an accelerating 
voltage of 120KV. The results with the 
magnification of 50K were shown in 
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) for two different 
silica contents. It is noted that the sample 
with 15wt% silica shown in Figure 1(a) 
was cured with D-230 curing agent.  On 
the other hand, the sample shown in 
Figure 1(b) with 40wt% silica loading 
was cured using H-100 hardener.  It was 
found that the particles are well dispersed 
and homogeneously distributed in the 
nanocomposites even though the particle 
loading is up to 40wt%. Therefore, based 
on the TEM observations, it was 
suggested that the present samples were 
regarded as the nanocomposites with 
fully exfoliated nanoparticles.  
To characterize the responses of the 
epoxy matrix cured with the two different 
 where mν  is the Poisson’s ratio of 
the matrix.   
The results obtained from the model 
prediction and experimental data were 
present in Figures 5 and 6 for ductile and 
brittle matrix systems, respectively.  It 
was shown, with the dispersed 
nanoparticles, the modulus of the 
nanocomposites increases at the particles 
loading up to 40 wt%. Furthermore, the 
enhancing tendency is quite coincided 
with the model predictions. However, the 
experimental data are a little lower than 
the model prediction. This discrepancy 
could be ascribed to the local 
non-homogeneity of the particle 
distribution within the nanocomposites, 
which may not be accounted for in the 
micromechanical model predictions.  
 
Three Point Bending Flexure Test 
The effect of silica nanoparticle on 
the flexural behaviors of the 
nanocomposites was determined from 
the three point bending test in accordance 
with the ASTM standard D790 [13]. 
During the tests, the crosshead is under 
stroke control, and the corresponding 
speed is set to be 1 mm/min. The flexural 
strength of the specimens is calculated 
from the following formulation: 
 
2bd2
PL3S =                         (6) 
 
where P is the applied failure load; 
L is the support span; and b and d 
represent the width and thickness of the 
specimens, respectively. Table 3 lists the 
flexural strength of the nanocomposites 
with two different matrix systems. 
Results revealed that the flexural strength 
increases with the increment of particle 
loadings in both ductile and brittle cases. 
The declining phenomena observed in 
the tensile strength for brittle matrix with 
20 or 40 wt% loading of particle was not 
taking place in the flexural strength. 
Since the flexural strength is dominated 
by the local material property where the 
stress sates is high, it may not be as 
sensitive as the tensile strength to the 
specimen flaw.    
 
Mode I Fracture Test 
In both tensile and flexural tests, 
results indicated that the nanocomposites 
with silica nanoparticles demonstrated 
higher stiffness and strength than the 
pure epoxy without any reinforcement. 
To further investigate the effect of the 
silica particle on the Mode I fracture 
toughness (KIC), the single-edge-notch 
bending (SENB) specimens were 
fabricated and then employed for the 
three point bending tests. The 
experiments were conducted basically 
following ASTM D5045 standards [14].   
The dimensions of the SENB 
specimens are illustrated in Figure 7 
where B denotes the thickness and W is 
the width of the sample. In an attempt to 
produce a sharp pre-crack tip, the 
pre-crack length (a in Figure 7) was 
created by a jewel saw followed by a new 
razor blade. The correlations of the 
dimensions W = 2B and a = B, suggested 
by ASTM D5045, were followed during 
the preparations of SENB specimens 
with the thickness B around 6.2 mm. 
Moreover, in order to measure a valid 
fracture toughness, the following 
inequality equation for the specimen size 
must also be satisfied: 
 
2
yI )/K(5.2)aW(,a,B σ>− ,         (7) 
 
where yσ  is the yielding stress of 
the materials, determined using the offset 
method with 0.002 offset strains in the 
stress strain curves shown in Figures 3 
and 4. During the experiments, at least 
four specimens were tested in each case 
 density of the pattern increases with the 
increment of silica loadings. Moreover, 
from the high magnification SEM 
micrographs, it is revealed that the 
fracture surface is pretty rough at the 
samples with higher silica particle 
loading. The rough fracture surface may 
be responsible for the increased fracture 
toughness of the nanocomposites. Again, 
the surface profiles of the 
nanocomposites were measured using 
AFM as shown in Figure 13. It is shown 
that for the composites with 40 wt% 
silica particles, the surface roughness is 
significant, coinciding with our SEM 
observations. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The tensile, flexural, and fracture 
behaviors of nanocomposites with two 
different matrix systems containing 
different silica nanoparticle loadings 
were investigated experimentally in this 
study. From the tensile tests, it was found 
that the tensile strength and stiffness 
increase with the increment of 
nanoparticle loadings, and the increasing 
behaviors can be described properly 
using the Mori-Tanaka micromechanical 
model. With regard to the fracture 
behavior, for the ductile matrix system, 
the increment ratio is around 15% at 40 
wt% of nanoparticle content. On the 
other hand, for the brittle system with 
40wt% nanoparticles, the enhancement 
can achieve to 80%. From SEM and 
AFM observations on the failure surfaces, 
it was indicated that the increment of 
fracture toughness was due to the plastic 
deformation accompanied with the 
nanoparticle debonding, which may 
consume more fracture energy and 
complicate the fracture extension.

Abstract: The load transfer efficiency from surrounding matrix to the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the CNTs 
nanocomposites was studies. Both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNTs) were taken into account in the investigation. A cylindrical representative volume element (RVE) 
containing the CNTs and polymer phases were employed in the shear lag analysis from which the axial stress 
distribution as well as the load transfer efficiency in the CNTs was characterized. The van der Waals interaction of the 
adjacent graphite layers in the MWCNTs was described using an interfacial region with low shear stiffness. For the 
sake of comparison, a covalent bonding between the graphic layers was assumed and modeled using an interfacial 
region with high shear stiffness. Results indicated that the SWCNTs exhibit superior load transfer efficiency than 
MWCNTs associated with the same CNT volume fraction in the composites. This is attributed to the fact that in the 
MWCNTs, the load carrying capabilities reduce as the number of graphic layers increase. Moreover, it is revealed 
that the deficient load transfer efficiency in the MWCNTs may not be improved even though the covalent bond 
between the graphite layers is constructed.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Due to the exceptional mechanical and physical 
properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been 
extensively utilized as reinforcement in composite 
materials. CNTs are long hollow cylinders of hexagonal 
graphene structures with the length extending from few 
tens of nanometers to several micrometers and the outer 
diameters ranging from 2.5 to 30nm. According to the 
geometric configuration, the CNTs can be roughly 
divided into two categories, i.e., one is single-walled 
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the other is 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The 
SWCNTs is a single graphene sheet that has been rolled 
into a hollow cylinder. On the other hand, the MWCNTs 
consist of many cylindrical graphene layers and the 
interactions of which are dominated by the van der Waals 
forces.  
The load transfer efficiency from the matrix to the 
CNTs play an important role on the mechanical response 
of the CNTs composites since it may affect the effective 
reinforcement capabilities of the CNTs. Haque and 
Ramasetty [1] utilized shear lag model to investigate the 
effects of CNTs aspect ratio, CNTs volume fraction, and 
matrix modulus on stress transfer in SWCNT composites 
indicating that no significant increase in CNT axial stress 
would occur when the CNTs volume fraction increases. 
In addition, the effect of polymer matrix modulus on 
axial stress distribution of CNTs is negligible. Zalamea et 
al [2] employed the shear transfer model as well as the 
shear lag model to understand the stress transfer from the 
outermost layer to the interior layers in the MWCNTs.  
They pointed out that as the layer number increases, the 
corresponding efficiency is declining. Gao and Li [3] 
incorporated the atomistic structures of the capped 
SWCNTs in the molecular structure mechanics and 
render the Young’s modulus of the effective cylindrical 
solids. Subsequently, the shear stress and the axial stress 
along the effective solid embedded in the matrix was 
analyzed using shear lag analysis. 
In view of the foregoing, most studies are focusing on 
the load transfer issue from the matrix to the SWCNTs, 
nevertheless, few researches regarding the stress transfer 
from the matrix to the outermost layer of MWCNTs and 
further to the inner layers were reported in the literatures.  
In this study, the stress transfer from the matrix to the 
outermost layer and then to the inner layer was 
characterized analytically using the shear lag model and 
the corresponding axial stress distribution in each 
graphene layers of MWCNTs was deduced explicitly.  
Moreover, the effect of interlayer van der Waals 
interaction on the stress transfer efficiency in the interior 
layers of MWCNTs was of concern. Finally, the results of 
this analytical model are validated with finite element 
analysis (FEA).  
 
2. SHEAR LAG MODEL 
 
2.1. Representative Volume Element 
In order to investigate the load transfer efficiency in 
the CNTs composites with simplicity, the CNTs assumed 
to be uniformly distributed and perfectly aligned within 
the matrix. Based on the characteristics of geometric 
periodicity, a unit cell containing a single CNT fiber was 
selected as a representative volume element (RVE) from 
which the mechanical properties of the CNTs composites 
1, 2 and 3, respectively. mG  is shear modulus of the 
matrix and Ef is the modulus of the graphite shell. It is 
noted that in the derivation, the atomistic interaction of 
the neighboring graphite layers was characterized using 
the interfacial shear modulus “ *12G ” which was 
introduced as

where 1w ,  2w and  3w are axial deformations of shells 1, 2 
and 3, respectively. Thus, the interaction of the interlayer 
was represented in the form and the shear stress acting on 
the surfaces of the graphite layers such as * 2mτ  and * 3mτ  
in Fig. 1. It is noted that since the derivation of the above 
equation are tedious, the details are not addressed here. 
For comparison purpose, the SWCNTs embedded in 
the matrix was also examined using shear lag model and 
the corresponding stress in the CNTs is yield as

In the derivation of stress distribution of the SWCNTs, 
the diameter of the CNTs is assumed to be the same as 
that of the outermost layer of the three-walled CNT such 
that the volume fractions of the reinforcement in both 
cases are the same. 
 
2.3. Effective Length 
In order to quantify the load transfer efficiency from 
the surrounding matrix to the MWCNTs as well as to 
understand the interlayer interaction effect of the adjacent 
graphite layers on the load transfer efficiency, the concept 
of effective length is introduced as  
dy
2
1 feffsf ∫−= LLL σσ ,             (8) 
where f σ  is the axial stress in the SWCNTs and sfσ  is 
corresponding to its saturated stress. As a result, based on 
the effective length concept, the average effective length 
for the three-walled CNT is expressed as  
dy)(
6
1 f3f2f1effsf ∫− ++= LLL σσσσ ,        (9) 
where f1σ  , f2σ  and f3σ  indicate the axial stress in the 
shell 1, shell 2, and shell 3, respectively, and sfσ  
indicates the saturated stress in the SWCNTs given by 
Eq.(7). 
 
3. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS 
 
The load transfer efficiency calculated through the 
shear lag model was validated by the FEA. Because of 
the attribute of the cylindrical tube of the unit cell, an 
axial symmetric FEA model was employed in the 
simulation of the load distribution on the CNTs 
composites. The material properties and geometric 
parameters used for three-walled CNT and matrix system 
are shown in Table 1. The interaction between the 
adjacent layers was simulated by using a thin layer of 
effective interphase with various shear moduli. The 
thickness of the effective interphase is selected to be 
0.01nm since results illustrate that when the thickness is 
less than such value, it may not have significant effects 
on the axial stress distributions in CNTs. Four different 
values of shear modulus 0.13, 0.268, 4.2 and 370GPa, 
were considered to simulate the atomistic interaction of 
the graphene layers in the study. It is noted that the value 
of 370GPa is used to simulate the covalent bonding 
established in the neighboring graphene layers if possible. 
 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
The axial stress distribution of the three-walled CNT 
is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that in all three layers, 
the stresses increase from the CNT ends and eventually 
attains the saturated value and moreover, in the outermost 
layer, the saturation rate is higher than the other layers. It 
should be mentioned that if the aspect ratio of the CNTs 
is not high enough, the saturated stress may not be 
accomplished.
