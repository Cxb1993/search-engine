 2
mmole of A-site and B-site metal ions were used. After vigorous stirring for half an hour, the solution was 
transferred into a rotary evaporator at 80oC. The temperature was maintained to remove solvents. The 
remaining paste was then collected and dried in air at 150oC for 10 hours using a heating rate of 10oC/min. 
Finally, the dried sample was calcined with the same heating rate from 150oC to 700oC for 2 hours. 
Catalyst characterization 
The surface areas were measured by a N2 automated adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, ASAP 2010). 
Before each trial, the sample was degassed at 105oC for 6 hours. Adsorption of N2, a probe species, was 
performed at −196°C. Surface areas of samples were calculated based on the method of Brunauer, Emmet, 
and Teller (BET).   
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Shimadzu Labx XRD-6000 using Cu-Kα 
radiation (0.15418 nm). Scans were conducted using 20o to 80o angle range (2θ) with a scanning rate of 
4o/min. The voltage and current used were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. Crystallite sizes were measured by 
employing the Scherrer relation, L = 0.9*λ/βcosθ, where L is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of 
radiation, β is the broadening of the peak due to the small crystallites (rad 2θ), and θ is the corresponding 
angle of the diffraction peak. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of each perovskite was estimated 
based on its strongest diffraction peak. The instrumental broadening effect was found to be negligible by using 
the Warren’s correction [18].  
The surface elemental analysis was performed by an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford INCA 
Energy 350) attached to the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6701F). X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD with a 180° 
hemispherical sector analyzer and a Al monochromator (Mg/Al achromatic source 450W max power). The 
dwell time was 0.3 seconds. Correction of the energy shift due to the static charging of the samples was 
accomplished with the O 1s peak at 528.4 eV as a reference. 
H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) were 
conducted in a U-shaped quartz reactor (i.d. = 6 mm) surrounded by a temperature-controlled furnace. A 
water-trap and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) were connected in series to record responses. For 
H2-TPR runs, the TCD current was set at 50 mA and the detector’s temperature was at 100oC; for TPD 
experiments, the TCD current was 170 mA at 150oC. Approximately 50 mg of sample was used per trial. Prior 
to each experiment, the sample was pretreated in Ar (H2-TPR, 23 ml/min) or He (TPD, 23 ml/min) at 120oC 
(10oC/min) for 30 minutes to remove physisorbed water. After cooling to room temperature, the H2-TPR was 
performed in a 7.4% H2/Ar stream (25 ml/min) by elevating the temperature to 900oC with a 5oC/min ramp 
rate. The TPD was conducted in a He stream with a heating rate of 5oC/min from 100oC to 925oC, followed by 
isothermal soaking at 925oC for 30 minutes. 
Activity measurements 
Catalytic performance was tested in a continuous fixed bed reactor (i.d. = 10 mm). The system outlet was 
connected inline to a gas chromatograph (GC, SRI 8610) equipped with a TCD, a methanizer, and a FID. 
Ultra-high purity Ar was used as the carrier gas. Before each trial, the catalyst was treated in a 10% O2/N2 
stream at 700oC for an hour using a 10oC/min heating rate from room temperature. A 5A Molecular sieve and 
Porapak Q columns were used to separate reactants and products. Identified effluents included N2, CO, CO2, 
H2, HCOH, CH3OH and trace CH4. No formic acid or methyl formate was detected. N2 also served as the 
internal standard. All products except H2O were measured relative to GC calibration standards. The amount of

Figure 3 depicts the H2-TPR profile of each sample. LaFe based perovskites showed comparatively weak 
H2 consumption responses, which is consistent with recent studies [13, 24, 25]. That is, LaFe and LaFePd 
perovskites were both difficult to be reduced. The XRD patterns of post-TPR LaFe and LaFePd samples show 
almost identical responses as their perovskite states. This confirms the reduction-proof chemistry of LaFe 
based perovskites. To clarify, signals of LaFe based perovskites were multiplied by a factor 10. Besides LaFe, 
all perovskites showed two different peaks.  
The H2-TPR profiles of LaMn-, LaFe-, and LaCo-based perovskites were highly convoluted, rendering 
ambiguous reduction mechanisms of these solid solutions. Generally, their reduction processes have been 
widely accepted to follow a multiple-step mechanism. Regarding LaMn based perovskites, Mn4+ and Mn3+ 
may coexist prior to the reduction. After the reduction, Mn2+ instead of Mn0 should be the final state of Mn 
ions [26]. This is also the case for LaFe, which may hold both Fe4+ and Fe3+ at the initial state; whereas both 
Fe2+ and metallic iron could be the reduced states of Fe ions [24]. For LaCo, the first peak presents Co3+ 
reduction into Co2+ to form brownmillerite (LaCoO2.5), followed by the second reduction of Co2+ to metallic 
cobalt [27, 28]. Controversially, a single-step reduction mechanism (Co3+ to Co0) was reported by Huang and 
coworkers [29], arguing that separated TPR peaks and unsymmetrical patterns should be attributed to 
differences of crystalline sizes and oxygen defects in the perovskite lattice. Such diverse structures may lead 
to various diffusion resistances during hydrogen reduction, thereby varying TPR profiles [29, 30].  
The shift of reduction peaks towards lower temperatures by doping Pd ions into LaMn, LaFe, and LaCo 
implies that the reducibility of perovskites can be substantially enhanced. In addition, dosing trace Pd ions 
into perovskites could increase the low temperature reduction peak area, except for LaCoPd. This could be 
explained by either increasing amount of small crystallites or defects of lattice structure [29, 30], or hydrogen 
spill-over through Pd particles to reduce Mnn+, Fen+ or Con+ species [31, 32]. It is worth noting that the 
reduction of PdO, which mostly occurs at about 100oC [33, 34], was not observed. This again reveals that Pd 
ions could be well embedded into the perovskite framework, resulting in the absence of a segregated peak 
caused by PdO reduction.  
Figure 4 shows the TPD profiles of LaMn-, LaFe-, and LaCo-based perovskites. In general, desorbed 
oxygen of perovskites can be classified into two types: α- and β-oxygen. The former has been assigned to 
weakly bonded oxygen species on perovskite surfaces; the latter has been known as the lattice oxygen in 
perovskite frameworks [34, 35]. Naturally, the weakly bonded α-oxygen can be released at relatively lower 
temperature compared to rigid bonded β-oxygen. Temperatures ranging from 700oC to 800oC have been 
employed as the demarcation between these two [35-37]. Both types of oxygen species play an important role 
in various oxidation reactions. For example, α-oxygen may promote combustion while β-oxygen is proposed 
to be responsible for partial oxidation [36]. In Figure 4, the amounts of α- and β-oxygen could be greatly 
improved by substituting Pd ions into perovskite frameworks. This suggests that the reactivities of LaMn, 
LaFe, and LaCo perovskites could be enhanced by the Pd substitution, in agreement with aforementioned 
H2-TPR studies. 
Figure 5 displays methanol and oxygen conversions as a function of reaction temperature. Incorporating 
5 mol% Pd ions could substantially increase activities of perovskites. At equivalent temperatures, Pd-doped 
perovskites were more than twice reactive as their Pd-free counterparts. For instance, LaMnPd possessed 
about 63% conversion at 220oC, which was three times higher than LaMn. This trend is in accord with 
previous H2-TPR results: the Pd-integrated perovskites had greater reducibilities than their Pd-free 
 6
to formaldehyde yields.  
The influence of B-site ions in Pd-free perovskites is highly complicated. It is unclear at this stage 
whether to correlate perovskite nature with its catalytic behavior. However, by doping trace Pd cations, partial 
oxidation and dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde became two major pathways. A close inspection 
of catalytic activities together with XPS spectra showed that the least active LaFePd had the highest 
Pdx+-to-Pd2+ ratio. Such a trend was also reported when applying Pd-containing perovskites as three-way 
catalysts for CO, NO and CH4 abatement [23]. It is plausible that the same could be stated in the partial 
oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. 
The chemistry and catalytic performance of lanthanum-transition metal perovskites can be substantially 
altered by dissolving trace Pd cations in their crystalline frameworks. The presented information led to 
following conclusions: 
1. The perovskite structure could be maintained by substituting up to 5 mol% B-site (Mn, Fe, and Co) 
cations with Pd cations. Segregated PdO was not observed. The positive effect on crystalline size was 
discovered when impregnating Pd cations into perovskites.  
2. Reducibilities and oxygen desorption of La-based perovskites, which are highly related to catalytic 
activities, were improved by incorporated Pd cations. Pd species exist in perovskites mostly as 
oxidized Pd2+; relatively less Pd3+ or Pd4+ could be identified. The former is proposed to be more 
active in methanol partial oxidation than the latter. 
3. Besides methanol partial oxidation to formaldehyde, methanol combustion, partial oxidation to 
syngas and dehydrogenation were found on Pd-free perovskites. In contrast, partial oxidation to 
formaldehyde and dehydrogenation were the two favored pathways on Pd-doped perovskites. 
Formaldehyde selectivities were insensitive to reaction temperature, ranging from 85% to 92% within 
the entire temperature region.
