Abstract—In this report, we present a turbo coded space-
time modulation scheme for noncoherent block fading channels,
where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel
state information. In part A, we focus on lowering down the
detection complexity of the conventional noncoherent MAP
(maximum a posteriori) detector for a non-coherent multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Compared to the scheme
using the exhaustive-search-based noncoherent MAP detector,
the proposed scheme achieves the same error performance, and
has a much lower detection complexity. In part B, the turbo
coded bits are divided into two parts which are respectively
transmitted through information-bearing pilots and spatial mul-
tiplexing (SM). Since this approach effectively increases the
cardinality of the set of possible transmit (space-time) signal
matrices, a large rate gain can be obtained without increasing
the modulation order, as shown through achievable-rate analysis.
At the receiver, an iterative detection-decoding algorithm is
performed cooperatively among the turbo decoder, the coherent
demapper for the SM, and the noncoherent demapper for the
information-bearing pilots. Compared to the previous work in the
literature, the proposed scheme can provide notable advantages
in both error performance and complexity.

I. 研究目標
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems such as
BLAST (Bell Labs Layered Space-Time), that use spatial
multiplexing (SM), are appealing for their capability of achiev-
ing large capacity over wireless fading channels. On the
other hand, MIMO techniques, such as space-time block
coding (STBC), are capable of providing spatial diversity
for combating fading. Either SM or STBC can be serially
concatenated with an outer code to achieve more reliable
communication. However, in these systems, it is assumed that
perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the
receiver. Actually, practical systems usually need to estimate
the CSI at the receiver, or use noncoherent communications.
Several noncoherent space-time signal designs, named unitary
space-time modulation (USTM), were designed to avoid the
requirement of channel state information at both the transmit-
ter and the receiver. However, the conventional noncoherent
detection method for USTM requires an exhaustive search
among all the possible T × Nt transmit signal matrices, and
has a complexity which is exponentially proportional to the
number of bits conveyed by the T ×Nt signal matrix.
In order to manage the increase in detection complexity, an
alternative noncoherent transmission scheme based on pilot
symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM), can be adopted. The
transmit signal matrix used is (scaled) unitary and consists of
one pilot matrix, followed by several independently modulated
sub-blocks. Through the pilot matrix, we can first obtain a
channel estimate, which is then employed to coherently detect
data bits in the remaining sub-blocks. In order to improve the
quality of channel estimation, part of the information-bearing
sub-blocks can be involved in the channel estimation in addi-
tion to the pilot matrix. The resultant TN ×Nt “information-
bearing” pilot matrix, where TN < T , remains unitary, and,
hence, the associated information bits can be noncoherently
detected. The detected (decided) “information-bearing” pilot
matrix is then used to estimate the channel matrix for the
coherent detection of the remaining data bits within the same
coherence interval (block). Since the coherent detection is
performed sub-block by sub-block, these two-stage detection
methods have the advantage of low complexity. However, there
is a performance loss since both the noncoherent detection
for the information-bearing pilots and the coherent detection
for the remaining sub-blocks do not fully use the channel
information inherent in the entire T×Nr receive signal matrix.
Hence, in part A of this project, we first device a nonco-
herent MAP detector with very low complexity for the or-
thogonally designed USTM using Gray-mapped QPSK signal

Abstract—In non-coherent multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems, the conventional noncoherent MAP detector
is too complex to be performed if the number of labelling bits
conveyed within one single coherence block is high. In order to
overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a noncoherent
MAP (maximum a posteriori) detector with very low complexity
for orthogonally designed USTM (unitary space-time modulation)
schemes. In addition, we show that the detected soft values are
independent of the extrinsic information fed back from the turbo
decoder. As a result, iterative detection and decoding between
the noncoherent detector and the turbo decoder can be avoided
without performance degradation. Compared to the scheme
using the exhaustive-search-based noncoherent MAP detector, the
proposed scheme achieves the same error performance, and has
a much lower detection complexity.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) [1] techniques,
such as space-time block coding (STBC), are capable of
providing spatial diversity for combating fading [2]-[4]. STBC
can be serially concatenated with an outer code to achieve
more reliable communications [5]-[7]. For these concatenated
schemes, sub-optimal iterative detection and decoding (IDD)
receivers were adopted.
The MIMO systems presented in [5]-[7] were investigated
based on perfect channel state information (CSI) at the re-
ceiver. Actually, practical systems usually need to estimate the
CSI at the receiver [8], or use noncoherent communications.
For a noncoherent block fading channel, the space-time signals
transmitted through Nt transmit antennas during a coherence
interval (time) of T can be expressed as a T × Nt transmit
signal matrix. The design of transmit signal matrix named
unitary space-time modulation (USTM), which is orthonormal
in time across the antennas, were presented in [9]-[11]. In
[10], a systematic construction method for the unitary space-
time modulation (USTM) was proposed. In this method, the
design criterion is to minimize the asymptotic (with SNR)
union bound on the error probability. The coded systematically
designed USTM scheme can be found in [12]. Due to the
lack of structure for the USTM signal sets designed in [10],
the noncoherent maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector given
in [12] requires an exhaustive search among all the possible
T ×Nt transmit signal matrices, and has a complexity which
is exponentially proportional to the number of bits conveyed
by the T ×Nt signal matrix.
On the other hand, an orthogonally designed USTM was
proposed in [13], in which the USTM signal is constructed
using a known pilot matrix followed by an STBC signal
matrix. It was shown in [13] that the orthogonally designed
USTM not only achieves a better error performance than the
systematically designed USTM proposed in [10], but also
enables a simplified maximum-likelihood (ML) detection with
lower complexity. To exploit the constellation structures and
improve coding gains, in [13], a trellis-coded USTM structure
was also investigated. On the other hand, a convolutional-
coded orthogonally designed USTM scheme was investigated
in [14]. It is noted that the same exhaustive-search-based
noncoherent MAP detector as that devised in [12] is still
utilized in [14].
It is known that the detection complexity grows exponen-
tially with the number of labelling bits conveyed through one
coherence interval, which is denoted by n. If the value of n is
high, the conventional noncoherent MAP detector is concerned
to be too complex. In this paper, we devise a noncoherent
MAP detector with very low complexity for the orthogonally
designed USTM using Gray-mapped QPSK signal constella-
tion. It is also shown that the iterative processing between the
noncoherent detector and the turbo decoder is unnecessary,
since the noncoherent MAP detection is independent of the
extrinsic information fed back from the turbo decoder. With
the aid of the simplified noncoherent MAP detector, the
proposed scheme achieves a 2n−1 times lower complexity and
the same error performance, when compared to the scheme
using the exhaustive-search-based noncoherent MAP detector.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the transmission architecture. Section III first
describes the proposed low-complexity noncoherent MAP
detector for the orthogonally designed USTM scheme, and
then gives the proof of the related theorem. Section IV presents
the evaluation of the BER performance. Finally, Section V
concludes this paper.
II. TURBO CODED ORTHOGONALLY DESIGNED UNITARY
SPACE-TIME MODULATION SCHEME
A. Block Fading Channel
The MIMO channel considered in this paper is a frequency-
nonselective Rayleigh block fading channel, where the channel
coefficients between antenna pairs, which are independent of
each other, are assumed to be constant over a fading block
while the transmit signal matrices X and the associated a
priori probabilities Γl are different. For convenience, in this
section, these 2n−1 signal matrices are respectively denoted as
X
0
,X
1
, · · · ,X2n−1−1, and the associated a priori probability
for Xi is denoted as Γi
l
. Note that the (l + 1)-th labeling bit,
i.e., bl, for all the matrices Xi, is 1. Similarly, there are 2n−1
exponential terms in the denominator of (5). The signal matrix
considered in the denominator associated with Xi is denoted
as X¯i. In other words, n− 1 labeling bits of X¯i are the same
as those of Xi while the (l + 1)-th labeling bit, i.e., bl, is 0.
Consequently, the associated a priori probability for X¯i is
also Γi
l
. Using these notations, (5) can be written as

, i = 0, 1, · · · , 2n−1 − 1. We
now prove the following two lemmas. The derivations for
Nt = 4 are given, and it is easy to generalize the derivations
to the cases with other number of transmit antennas.
Lemma 1: Given a fixed bl, the values of
tr{Y†Xi(Xi)†Y} − tr{Y†X¯i(X¯i)†Y} are the same
for all i = 0, 1, · · · , 2n−1 − 1 if QPSK signals using Gray
mapping are adopted.

and r = 0, 1, 2, 3. Without loss of generality, we assume that

It can be verified that tr{Y†Xi(Xi)†Y} −

and the matrix A is defined in (13).
For signals using Gray mapping, let (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and
(1, 1) respectively map to the constellation points 1, j,−j,
and −1. If bl is the first labeling bit, then (mi0, m¯i0) ∈
{(j 3pi
2
, 0), (jpi, j
pi
2
)} and emi0 − em¯i0 = √2e−j 34pi for all i.
Since (13) only depends on emi0 − em¯i0 , Lemma 1 holds.
If bl is the second labeling bit, (mi0, m¯i0) ∈
{(j pi
2
, 0), (jpi, j
3pi
2
)} and emi0 − em¯i0 = √2ej 34pi for all
i, and Lemma 1 also holds.
Lemma 2: Given a fixed bl value, if the values of
tr{Y†Xi(Xi)†Y} − tr{Y†X¯i(X¯i)†Y} are the same for
all i = 0, 1, · · · , 2n−1 − 1 and tr{Y†Xq(Xq)†Y} ≥
tr{Y†Xr(Xr)†Y} for two arbitrary Xq and Xr
matrices, then tr{Y†X¯q(X¯q)†Y} ≥ tr{Y†X¯r(X¯r)†Y}
and tr{Y†X¯q(X¯q)†Y} − tr{Y†X¯r(X¯r)†Y} =
tr{Y†Xq(Xq)†Y} − tr{Y†Xr(Xr)†Y}.
Proof: According to Lemma 1, we have
tr{Y†(Xq(Xq)† − X¯q(X¯q)†)Y} − tr{Y†(Xr(Xr)† −

)Y} = 0 and tr{Y†(X¯q(X¯q)† − X¯r(X¯r)†)Y} =
tr{Y†(Xq(Xq)† −Xr(Xr)†)Y} ≥ 0.
With Lemmas 1 and 2, the proof of Theorem 1 is given.
Proof of Theorem 1: The calculation associated with
the numerator and the denominator of (7) can be performed
recursively, and involve only the maximum functions and
correction functions fc(z) defined as fc(z) = ln(1 + e−|z|)
[16]. For example, consider the case with two exponential
terms in the numerator. Function ln(eω0 + eω1) can be written
as max{ω0, ω1}+ln(1+e−|ω0−ω1|) = max{ω0, ω1}+fc(ω0−
ω1) [16]. where the correction function fc(z) is defined as
fc(z) = ln(1 + e
−|z|
).
If we let ω = ln(eω0 + eω1) and, hence, eω = eω0 + eω1 ,
then the resulting three exponential terms can be calculated
as ln(eω0 + eω1 + eω2) = ln(eω + eω2) = max{ω2, ω} +
fc(ω2 − ω) = max {ω2,max{ω0, ω1}+ fc(ω0 − ω1)} +
fc(ω2 − max{ω0, ω1} − fc(ω0 − ω1)). Similarly, for
the denominator, we have ln(eω¯0 + eω¯1 + eω¯2) =
max {ω¯2,max{ω¯0, ω¯1}+ fc(ω¯0 − ω¯1)} + fc(ω¯2 −
max{ω¯0, ω¯1} − fc(ω¯0 − ω¯1)). If we suppose that the indices
i for ωi are chosen such that ω0 ≤ ω1 ≤ · · · ≤ ω2n−1−1,
using the results given in Lemma 2, we have
ω¯0 ≤ ω¯1 ≤ · · · ≤ ω¯2n−1−1 and ωq − ωr = ω¯q − ω¯r
for arbitrary q and r values. Hence, for both the two and three
exponential terms, the correction terms associated with the
numerator and the denominator can be totally canceled, and
the remaining terms associated with the numerator and the
denominator have the same index number denoted as q. Thus,
the resultant LM,e(bl) value can be written as ωq− ω¯q. For an
arbitrary number of exponential terms in the numerator and
the denominator of (7), the resultant formula still involves
only the maximum and correction functions. Hence, we can

unitary PSAM and the USTM with an outer channel code. For
these coded noncoherent transmission systems, the operating
SNR region is significantly lower than that of the uncoded
system. Although unitary space-time signals achieve channel
capacity under the conditions mentioned earlier, the optimality
of the unitary space-time signals may be lost when the SNR
is low and 𝑇 is small.
In this paper, we propose a turbo coded space-time mod-
ulation scheme, which is expected to operate in the low-
SNR region, for noncoherent block fading channels with
small 𝑇 values. The turbo coded bits are divided into two
groups which are respectively transmitted through the USTM
presented in [18] and the SM. Therefore, the 𝑇 ×𝑁𝑡 transmit
signal matrix, which is not necessarily unitary, consists of
a USTM sub-matrix and an SM sub-matrix. Through the
use of SM, the cardinality of the set of all the possible
transmit signal matrices and, hence, the transmission rate,
can be increased. Since the USTM signals can be used as
the “information-bearing” pilots, a joint detection/estimation
technique can be devised such that the bitwise log-likelihood
ratios (LLRs) for the bits in the USTM and SM sub-matrices
can be generated through the use of a noncoherent demapper
and a coherent demapper, respectively. In order to mitigate
the performance loss encountered in [20]-[24], the channel
information inherent in the entire 𝑇×𝑁𝑟 receive signal matrix
should be utilized in the detectors for both the USTM and
the SM sub-matrices. This goal is achieved with the help of a
proposed module called the signal matrix detector (SMD). The
proposed IDD algorithm thus performs cooperatively among
the turbo decoder, the coherent demapper, the noncoherent
demapper, and the SMD.
The main contributions/results of this paper are summarized
as follows:
1) Using both USTM and SM, a class of transmit signal
matrices, which can achieve larger rate gains compared
to the PSAM-based transmit signal matrix used in [23],
is proposed.
2) Two noncoherent demappers with low computational
complexity are devised for the USTM proposed in
[18]. In addition, a joint estimation/detection method
is devised for the proposed transmit signal matrix.
3) A turbo coded noncoherent transmission architecture
and the associated IDD receiver are devised. It is
shown that the proposed system can achieve a per-
formance which is 0.7 dB away from the minimum
required SNR for reliable transmission.
4) Compared to the coded noncoherent systems designed
in [23][25], the proposed system can also provide a
better BER, a lower detection complexity, and a similar
decoding complexity if the same outer code is used.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sections II
and III describe the proposed transmission architecture and
the proposed IDD receiver, respectively. Section IV presents
an evaluation of the BER performance, and compares the
proposed system with the previous work in the literature.
Finally, Section V concludes this paper.

SPACE-TIME MODULATION
A. Block Fading Channel
The MIMO channel considered in this paper is a frequency-
nonselective Rayleigh block fading channel, where the channel
coefficients between antenna pairs which are independent of
each other are assumed to be constant over a fading block
of 𝑇 channel uses, and change independently from block to
block. 𝑇 is referred to as the coherence time (interval). Within
the coherence time, the receive signal matrix Y ∈ 𝒞𝑇×𝑁𝑟
and the transmit signal matrix X ∈ 𝒞𝑇×𝑁𝑡 are related by
Y =
√
𝜌
𝑁𝑡
XH+W, where H ∈ 𝒞𝑁𝑡×𝑁𝑟 and W ∈ 𝒞𝑇×𝑁𝑟
respectively denote the channel coefficient matrix and the
additive white Gaussian noise matrix, and 𝜌 is the average
SNR at each receive antenna. Both H and W are complex
Gaussian matrices with independent and identically distributed
𝒞𝒩 (0, 1) entries. In a noncoherent channel, where both the
transmitter and the receiver do not know the H matrix, the
conditional p.d.f. 𝑃 (Y∣X) is given by [15]

where Λ ≡ I𝑇 + (𝜌/𝑁𝑡)XX† denotes the 𝑇 × 𝑇 covariance
matrix for each column of Y.
B. Proposed Transmission Architecture
In this paper, we propose constructing transmit signal matrix
X using both USTM and SM. Through the use of SM,
the proposed transmit signal matrix achieves large rate gains
over the PSAM-based transmit signal matrix used in [23], as
demonstrated in Section II-C. The USTM signal is required
to ensure that the entire 𝑇 × 𝑁𝑡 transmit signal matrix is
noncoherently detectable. In addition, a low-complexity joint
detection/estimation technique can be devised through the use
of USTM signals. In order to increase transmission reliability,
an outer turbo code is serially concatenated with the mappers
for USTM and SM.

fading blocks with coherence time 𝑇 . An interleaved codeword

Let the 𝑛-bit vector b𝑁 = (𝑏0, 𝑏1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑏𝑛−1) and the
(𝑚 − 𝑛)-bit vector b𝐶 = (𝑏𝑛, 𝑏𝑛+1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑏𝑚−1) be the la-
beling vectors of X𝑁 and X𝐶 , respectively. If we write
b = (b𝑁 ,b𝐶), which is used to label X, we define
𝒜𝑙=𝑠 ≡ {b∣𝑏𝑙 = 𝑠}, 𝑠 ∈ {0, 1}. The non-coherent demapper
produces the a posteriori LLR of 𝑏𝑙, denoted by 𝐿𝑀,𝑁,𝑝(𝑏𝑙),
𝑙 = 0, 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑛− 1, according to

Although a noncoherent demapper performing (7) can ex-
ploit the channel information inherent in Y𝐶 , the calculation
of the LLR using (7) is too complex and far from being
practical for large values of 𝑚. For example, the number of
total labeling bits inX when using 𝑇 = 6 and 8PSK is equal to
18, i.e., 𝑚 = 18, and 217 exponential terms will be calculated
in both the numerator and denominator of (7) for each 𝑏𝑙.
Motivated by the receiver investigated in [29], we now pro-
pose a lower-complexity noncoherent demapper with partial
decision feedback (ND-PDF). In the ND-PDF, instead of using
the undetected X𝐶 , the detected (decided) Xˆ𝐶 , which can
be obtained from the SMD, is adopted to effectively exploit
the channel information inherent in Y𝐶 . The details of the
SMD will be introduced in the next subsection. Consequently,

demapper only needs to consider all possible X𝑁 matrices
rather than consider all possible X matrices and has a much
lower complexity than that of (7). For example, the total
number of labeling bits in X𝑁 when using 𝑇 = 6 and 8PSK
signals equals 6, i.e., 𝑛 = 6, and 25 exponential terms will be
calculated in both the numerator and denominator of (8) for
each 𝑏𝑙. As the iteration progresses, Xˆ𝐶 becomes increasingly

Algorithm 1 Proposed Iterative Detection and Decoding Al-
gorithm.
First Outer Iteration:
∙ Use (X𝑁𝜏 , Y𝑁𝜏 ) to obtain the LMMSE channel estimate
Hˆ(1).
∙ Use the coherent demapper presented in [10] to gen-
erate the bit-wise extrinsic LLRs for the bits in v𝐶 , i.e.,
𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝐶).
∙ Utilize (9) (or (10) for Gray-mapped QPSK constellations)
to generate the extrinsic LLRs for the bits in v𝑁 , i.e.,
𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝑁 ).
∙ Mix and de-interleave 𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝑁 ) and 𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝐶) to be the
a priori LLRs of the decoder.
∙ Perform turbo decoding for 𝑁𝐼 iterations to generate 𝑎
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖 LLRs 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v𝑁 ), 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v𝐶), and extrinsic LLRs
𝐿𝐷,𝑒(v𝑁 ), 𝐿𝐷,𝑒(v𝐶).
Other Outer Iterations:
∙ Signal Matrix Detector:
1) Make a hard decision from 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v𝑁 ) to obtain vˆ𝑁 .
2) Make a hard decision from 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v𝐶) and flip the 𝛿
most unreliable bits to obtain 2𝛿 candidates vˆ𝐶,𝑘, 𝑘 =
0, 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 2𝛿 − 1.
3) Use vˆ𝑘 = (vˆ𝑁 , vˆ𝐶,𝑘) as the labeling vector and obtain
the associated signal matrix Xˆ𝑘, 𝑘 = 0, 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 2𝛿 − 1.
Choose Xˆ(𝑞) from Xˆ𝑘, 𝑘 = 0, 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 2𝛿 − 1, according
to (11).
∙ Use (Xˆ(𝑞), Y) to obtain a preliminary channel estimate
H˜(𝑞).
∙ Obtain the 𝑞-th channel estimate Hˆ(𝑞) by properly com-
bining H˜(𝑞) and Hˆ(𝑞−1).
∙ Use Hˆ(𝑞) to generate 𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝐶) through the coherent
demapper.
∙ Use the proposed ND-PDF to generate 𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝑁 ) accord-
ing to (8).
∙ Mix and de-interleave 𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝑁 ) and 𝐿𝑀,𝑒(v𝐶) to be the
a priori LLRs of the decoder.
∙ Perform turbo decoding for 𝑁𝐼 iterations to generate 𝑎
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖 LLRs 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v𝑁 ), 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v𝐶), and extrinsic LLRs
𝐿𝐷,𝑒(v𝑁 ), 𝐿𝐷,𝑒(v𝐶).
Final Decision:
∙ After 𝑁𝑂 iterations, obtain the decoded code bits by
performing hard decisions from 𝐿𝐷,𝑝(v).
perform the noncoherent demapping using (10) instead of
(9). 2) The noncoherent demapping is performed only for the
first iteration. For the remaining iterations, we keep using the
𝐿𝑀,𝑁,𝑒(𝑏𝑙) values obtained at the first iteration.
Example 1 : The parameters 𝑇 = 6, 𝑇𝑁 = 4, 𝑇𝐶 = 2,
𝑁𝑡 = 2, and 𝑁𝑟 = 1 are used. The generators of both
constituent codes of the turbo code are the same and are given
by (1, 5/7)𝑜𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑙. The channel code rate 𝑅𝑐 is punctured to
1/2 (information bits/code bit). A Gray-mapped QPSK signal
constellation is adopted in both X𝑁 and X𝐶 , and hence the
average transmission rate 𝑅 is equal to one information bit
per channel use.
We now evaluate the receiver complexity through the
transmitter defined in Example 1. For the proposed IDD
receiver, the inner receiver consists of both the noncoherent
and coherent demappers, the SMD, and the channel estimator.
For Example 1, it was evaluated that the complexity of the
coherent demapper and the channel estimator is about 22
and 29.33 times lower, respectively, compared to the total
complexity of the noncoherent demapper using (8) and the
SMD using (11). The reason is briefly stated as follows. Since
the detection of bits in X𝐶 is performed MIMO symbol by
MIMO symbol while the detection of bits in X𝑁 is performed
by considering all the possibleX𝑁 instead of only one MIMO
symbol, the complexity of the coherent demapper is lower
than that of the noncoherent demapper. In addition, since the
channel estimation is performed only once for each outer
iteration, the complexity of the channel estimator is also
lower than that of the noncoherent demapper. Consequently,
the total complexity of the noncoherent demapper and the
SMD dominates the complexity of the inner receiver. Since
the argument of the exponential function in (8), which is
used in the noncoherent demapper (ND-PDF detector), is also
identical to (11) used in the SMD, (2𝑛 + 2𝛿) calculations of
(11) are needed for each outer iteration when considering the
proposed IDD receiver. Moreover, for the simplified receiver
using (10), only ( 𝑇𝑁𝑁𝑟𝑇 (𝑁𝑡+𝑁𝑟)𝑁𝑂 (𝑛 + 1) + 2
𝛿) calculations of
(11), on average, are required for each outer iteration, since
the noncoherent demapping is only performed for the first
iteration. Accordingly, the value of 𝛿 significantly affects the
complexity of the inner receiver. For the short coherence
interval considered in this paper, only a small number of 𝛿
values are required.
We now consider an exhaustive-search-based inner receiver
that performs noncoherent demapping for all the bits in both
the USTM and SM sub-matrices according to (7). Since the
argument of (7) is also identical to the noncoherent metric
(11), the computational complexity of the exhaustive-search-
based inner receiver can also be estimated by using the number
of calculations of (11). For Example 1, the exhaustive-search-
based detector involves 2𝑚 calculations of (11) and is about
254 times higher than that of the proposed simplified IDD
receiver.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. EXIT Chart Analysis
For the following discussions, X𝑁 (Y𝑁 ) and X𝐶 (Y𝐶)
are respectively regarded as the noncoherent part and the
coherent part within the transmit (receive) signal matrix X
(Y). Following [6]-[9], we use EXIT charts [12] to illustrate
the behavior of the proposed IDD receiver. Fig. 5 shows the
EXIT charts for Example 1 using the proposed receiver. For
the noncoherent (coherent) demapper corresponding to the
noncoherent (coherent) part, the mutual information between
a labeling bit and its 𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖/extrinsic LLR is denoted
as 𝐼𝑀,𝑁,𝑎/𝐼𝑀,𝑁,𝑒 (𝐼𝑀,𝐶,𝑎/𝐼𝑀,𝐶,𝑒). The “extrinsic mutual
information” 𝐼𝑀,𝑁,𝑒 (𝐼𝑀,𝐶,𝑒) is a function of both the 𝐸𝑏/𝑁0
and the “𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖 mutual information” 𝐼𝑀,𝑁,𝑎 (𝐼𝑀,𝐶,𝑎).
For the coherent demapper, the normalized MSE 𝛾 of the
channel estimate directly affects 𝐼𝑀,𝐶,𝑒 and, hence, 𝐼𝑀,𝐶,𝑒
is also a function of 𝛾. The “𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖/extrinsic mutual in-
formation” for the partial turbo codeword v𝐶 (v𝑁 ), denoted

estimation adopted in the proposed algorithm when 𝛿 = 4.
The channel estimation in the proposed algorithm provides an
SNR gain of 0.6 dB over the information-bearing pilot based
estimator at 𝛾 = −14 dB and achieves an MSE which is
only 0.15 dB away from the Cramer-Rao bound [30] (curve
F) when the SNR > 7.5 dB. Consequently, the proposed IDD
algorithm can provide more reliable channel estimates which
will contribute to the demapping of the coherent part.
C. The Proposed Transmission Architecture Using Various
Inner Receivers
In this subsection, we consider the transmitter described in
Example 1 and evaluate its BER performance and complexity
using various inner receivers. In addition to the proposed IDD
receivers, we investigate an IDD receiver using the phase-
quantization-based inner receiver presented in [23], where the
bit-wise LLR values are generated based on the phase quan-
tization of the channel matrix. Therefore, the bit-wise LLR
values are generated among a subset of the possible transmit
signal matrices through the calculation of the noncoherent
metric (11). When a quantization level of 𝑄 is used, the
phase-quantization-based inner receiver demands (𝑚 + 1)𝑄
calculations of (11) for each outer iteration.
Table I summarizes the complexity of the inner receiver
and the BERs for Example 1 based on the proposed receiver
using ND-PDF, the proposed simplified IDD receiver, and
the phase-quantization-based receiver. The associated BER
curves are shown in Fig. 7. The proposed simplified IDD
receiver suffers from a performance degradation of 0.21 dB at
a BER of 2 × 10−5, but has an inner receiver complexity
which is about two times lower compared to the receiver
using ND-PDF. Both proposed receivers have a better error
performance and a lower inner receiver complexity compared
to the phase-quantization-based receiver using either 𝑄 = 64
(8 samples for each channel path) or 𝑄 = 16. It was
also verified through simulation that when using the phase-
quantization-based receiver, the improvement in BER is minor

†The complexity is evaluated through the number of calculations of (11), and
the parameters 𝑛 and 𝑚 denote the number of labeling bits contained in the
noncoherent part X𝑁 and the number of labeling bits contained in the entire
transmit signal matrix X, respectively.
∗The normalized complexity for each scheme is obtained as follows. First,
we calculate the number of calculations of (11) using the corresponding
complexity formula. Then we divide this number by 𝑚 to obtain the
complexity per labeling bit. Finally, we normalize the complexity (per labeling
bit) of the considered scheme to the complexity (per labeling bit) of Example
1 using the proposed simplified IDD receiver.
when 𝑄 > 64. Consequently, the proposed IDD receivers are
more suitable for the proposed transmission architecture.
D. Comparison with Existing Works
In this subsection, we fix the dimensions of the USTM sub-
matrix X𝑁 to be 4×2 and adjust the transmission time 𝑇𝐶 of
the SM sub-matrix X𝐶 to construct several proposed systems
which will be compared with the coded noncoherent space-
time systems presented in [23][25]. For the case of 𝑇 = 6, we
compare the proposed system with the coded PSAM system
presented in [23], in which an optimized irregular LDPC code
is adopted. The average data rates 𝑅 for both systems are
the same, and are 1 and 1.5 (bit/channel use) when using
QPSK and 8PSK, respectively. The BER results for QPSK
and 8PSK are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively, where the
BER results for the LDPC coded PSAM system are transcribed
from [23]. The proposed scheme can achieve a gain of at least
1.3 dB at a BER of 10−4 compared to the LDPC coded system
presented in [23]. Since the authors in [23] did not provide
detailed information related to the parity-check matrix and the
decoding algorithm of the optimized LDPC code, it is difficult
to compare the error performance based on a similar decoder
complexity. Consequently, we also investigate the use of 4-
state and 16-state turbo codes for the PSAM-based system.
From the related results shown in Fig. 8, the BER performance
of the proposed turbo coded system is also better than that of
the turbo coded PSAM system.
For the case of 𝑇 = 8, the turbo coded USTM system
described in [25] is used in comparison. For this system,

APPENDIX B
DERIVATIONS OF THE PROPOSED LOW-COMPLEXITY
NONCOHERENT MAP DEMAPPER
We now prove the low-complexity noncoherent MAP
demapper given in (10). In the following, the derivations for
𝑁𝑡 = 2 are given. The proof can be easily generalized for
other USTM designs with 𝑁𝑡 > 2 presented in [18], and
holds for an arbitrary number of 𝑁𝑟 values. For convenience
of presentation, we omit the subscript 𝑁 of X𝑁 and Y𝑁
matrices in the following. There are 2𝑛−1 exponential terms
in the numerator of (9). For each of these terms, the receive
𝑇𝑁×𝑁𝑟 signal matrixY is identical, while the transmit signal
matrices X and the associated 𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖 probabilities Γ are
different. For convenience, in Appendix B, these 2𝑛−1 signal
matrices are respectively denoted as X0, X1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , X2𝑛−1−1,
and the associated 𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖 probability for X𝑖 is denoted as
Γ𝑖. Note that the (𝑙 + 1)-th labeling bit, i.e., 𝑏𝑙, for all the
matrices X𝑖, is 1. Similarly, there are 2𝑛−1 exponential terms
in the denominator of (9). The signal matrix considered in the
denominator associated with X𝑖 is denoted as X¯𝑖. In other
words, 𝑛− 1 labeling bits of X¯𝑖 are the same as those of X𝑖
while the (𝑙 + 1)-th labeling bit, i.e., 𝑏𝑙, is 0. Consequently,
the associated 𝑎 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟𝑖 probability for X¯𝑖 is also Γ𝑖. Using
these notations, (9) can be written as

𝑡𝑟{Y†X¯𝑖X¯†𝑖Y} are the same for all 𝑖 = 0, 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 2𝑛−1− 1 if

of T channel uses, and change independently from block to
block. T is referred to as the coherence time (interval). Within
the coherence time, the receive signal matrix Y ∈ CT×Nr
and the transmit signal matrix X ∈ CT×Nt are related by
Y =
√
ρ
Nt
XH+W, where H ∈ CNt×Nr and W ∈ CT×Nr
respectively denote the channel coefficient matrix and the
additive white Gaussian noise matrix. ρ denotes the average
SNR at each receive antenna. Both H and W are complex
Gaussian matrices with independent and identically distributed
CN (0, 1) entries. In a noncoherent channel, where the H
matrix is unavailable at both the transmitter and the receiver,
the conditional p.d.f. Pr(Y|X) is given by [9]
Pr(Y|X) = exp{−tr{Λ

where Λ ≡ IT + (ρ/Nt)XX† denotes the T × T covariance
matrix for each column of Y and † denotes the conjugate
transpose.
B. Transmission Architecture
The tranceiver architecture can be found in Fig. 1. At
the transmitter, a turbo code word is first fed to a bit-wise
interleaver, and then transmitted across multiple fading blocks
with coherence time T . The length-L interleaved codeword v
is divided into several length-n vectors, and used to label the
transmitted USTM signal matrices. In other words, a turbo
codeword is transmitted across multiple coherence intervals.
Within one coherence interval, the T × Nt transmit signal
matrix X can be written as
X =
[ √
ρτ
ρ
P
⊤
√
ρd
ρ
X
⊤

. (2)
where ⊤ denotes the traspose. We consider an example of
using Nt = 4 and QPSK signals. The known pilot matrix P
and the STBC data sub-block Xd are available in [3], and can
be respectively written as
P
⊤

em2 0 e−m0 −e−m1


 , (4)
where m0,m1,m2 ∈ {0, j pi2 , jpi, j 3pi2 }, and ρτ and ρd respec-
tively denote the SNR value for the pilot part and the data part.
In this paper, we consider a system with equal pilot power and
data power. When Nt = 4, ρτ = ρd = 43ρ.
III. LOW-COMPLEXITY NONCOHERENT MAP DETECTOR
FOR THE ORTHOGONALLY DESIGNED USTM SCHEME
At the receiver, the detector generates log-likelihood ratio
(LLR) values for the labelling bits. After the LLR values for an
entire turbo codeword are collected, these soft values are fed
forward to the turbo decoder, and used as the received channel
values in the decoding process. After performing NI inner
decoding iterations for the turbo code, the decoder generates
the extrinsic LLR values for each code bit, and then feeds them
back to the detector as the a priori information of the labelling
bits. The detector and the decoder exchange soft information
with each other for NO outer iterations.
Recently, we proposed a coded noncoherent space-time
modulation scheme considering both USTM and spatial mul-
tiplexing in [15]. Motivated by the low-complexity detection
method developed in [15], in this paper, a noncoherent MAP
detector with very low complexity is proposed for the orthogo-
nally designed USTM scheme with Nt = 4. It is worth noting
that only the case Nt = 2 was addressed in [15].
Let b denote a length-n labelling bit vector of the USTM
matrix X and f(·) denote the mapping from b to X. The
noncoherent MAP detector [12] can be derived by using (1),
and the detected LLR values for the l-th labelling bit in b,
LM,e(bl), l = 0, 1, · · · , n− 1, can be written as
LM,e(bl) = ln
∑
X:f(b),b:bl=1
e

where tr{·} denotes the trace function and Γl ≡∑
n−1
i=0,i6=l
1
2
(2bi − 1)LM,a(bi). Consequently, there are a total
of 2n exponential terms to be generated when computing the
LM,e(bl) value. In this section, it will be shown that when
using the Gray-mapped QPSK signals, the noncoherent MAP
detector given in (5) can be simplified to
LM,e(bl) =
1
T +
Nt
ρ
{
tr{Y†XX†Y} − tr{Y†X¯X¯†Y}} , (6)
whereX and X¯ respectively denote two signal matrices which
only differ in the l-th bit of b, and can be arbitrary chosen
from all possible 2n−1 matrix pairs. Instead of generating
2
n exponential terms in (5), only two exponential terms is
required in (6), which achieves an extremely low detection
complexity.
For the noncoherent MAP detector given in (6), it can be
seen that for l = 0, 1, · · · , n− 1, the calculation of LM,e(bl)
is independent of values of LM,a(bq), 0 ≤ q ≤ n− 1, q 6= l.
Hence, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1: For a noncoherent coded scheme using the
orthogonally designed USTM presented in [13] with Gray-
mapped QPSK signal, the iterative processing between the
noncoherent MAP detector and the channel decoder does
not provide advantages on error performance, when using an
arbitrary number of receive antennas, i.e., Nr.
Before proving this theorem, we need to introduce two lem-
mas. In the original formula of noncoherent MAP detector (5),
there are 2n−1 exponential terms in the numerator. For each of
these terms, the receive T×Nr signal matricesY are identical,
A ≡ ρd
ρ


0 −(emi0 − em¯i0) emi0 − em¯i0 emi0 − em¯i0

 . (13)
now simplify the noncoherent MAP detector given in (7) as
LM,e(bl) =
1
T +
Nt
ρ
{
tr{Y†Xq(Xq)†Y} − tr{Y†X¯q(X¯q)†Y}} . (14)
According to Lemma 1, no matter which signal matrix pair Xq
and X¯q survived after the cancelation process, the LM,e(bl)
value is the same and is independent of the a priori informa-
tion of all the other labeling bits. Hence, X and X¯ can be
arbitrary chosen from all possible 2n−1 pairs, in which the
labelling bit vectors only differ in bl.
IV. SIMULATION AND DISCUSSION
The simulation results for the turbo coded orthogonally
designed USTM scheme using the proposed low-complexity
noncoherent MAP detector are given in Fig. 2 and 3 using
Nt = 2 and 4, respectively. For the outer turbo code, the
generators of both constituent codes are the same and are given
by (1, 5/7)octal. The code length L is set to be 9756, and the
inner iteration number NI is set to be 20. Based on the result
given in Theorem 1, the inner iteration number NO is set to
be 1.
The detection complexity is dominated by the number
of exponential terms generated in the detector. For (5), 2n
exponential terms are required. By contrast, only 2 terms
are required in (6). With the considered system parameters,
using the proposed low-complexity noncoherent MAP detector
achieves the same error performance and a detection complex-
ity 32 times lower than that of using the exhaustive-search-
based noncoherent MAP detector.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we devised a noncoherent MAP detector
with very low detection complexity for the turbo-coded or-
thogonally designed USTM scheme. Using the same system
parameters, the proposed scheme achieves the same error
performance, and a detection complexity 2n−1 time lower than
that of the conventional scheme using the exhaustive-search-
based noncoherent MAP detector.
