 
induce created to a cells structure in high plastic strain amplitude[12,15] . The dislocation
structure easily forms dislocation cells at high plastic strain amplitude because high plastic
strain amplitude induces a multiple slip system reaction [12, 15]. It also reports point out that
this dislocation evolution at the grain and twin boundaries is fast than in inter of grain. It is
due to the strain localization [16-18]. At the same time the dislocation evolution in large size
grain is more complete than that in small size grain, and the saturation stress of fatigue in
large grain is higher than small grain [19-22].
The dislocation structure ahead of the crack tips has seldom been reported in the literature.
The dislocation structure at high rate of crack propagation is cell structure in copper [23, 24].
In the last decade Huang et al. [25] indicated that regardless what the crack propagation rate
is, the dislocation structure in front of the crack tips is cell structure. It is remarkable that the
crack propagation rate is retardate when the load condition changes from high to low. Based
on the plasticity theory, the plastic zone size in high loading condition is larger than small
loading condition. It results to the compressive stress in residual stress. At the same time, the
plastic strain energy is stored in the microstructure during fatigue [12]. Therefore, the
dislocation morphology is variable when the load condition is changed during fatigue.
According to Laird [26] pointed out that the dislocation structure changes from cells to loop
patches when the load amplitude varies from high to low, however no observation the results
in experimental to verify this. Huang et. al’s [27] result pointed out that the dislocation
structure re-development evolves from mis-orientation cells into loop patches for
polycrystalline copper when the strain amplitude changes from high to low during fatigue.
However, Huang’s result is by means of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to
investigate the dislocation structure evolution. Nevertheless, the disadvantage in using TEM
is that the region of observation is limited. In other words, the region of observation is
scarcely restricted by the TEM sample preparation. In order to improve the drawback of
TEM, Zauter [28] had reported that the microstructure can be observed by a back-scatter
electron image (BEI) of the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The advantage of BEI is
easy to prepare sample and the investigation region is widely. Huang et al [29, 30]
successfully observed the dislocation structure of copper and interstitial free (IF) steel in low
cycle fatigue regardless of the strain amplitude using this technique. Simultaneously, Huang
et al [31] was also completed to examine the dislocation evolution when the loading is
subjected a peak of overloading in crack propagation tips. Based on above results, The BEI
of SEM is an effective method to study the microstructure variation in fatigue.
The dislocation structure evolution ahead of crack tips in ultra-large grain (average grain size
of about 600m) in pure copper system reported in the literature is scarcely. It because of the
study dislocation structure in front crack tips is a tedious work by means of TEM. However,
the disadvantage of TEM can overcome by means of SEI of SEM. Therefore, the dislocation
structure evolution closed crack tips in ultra-large grain subjected to high-low propagation
rate can examine by BEI of SEM technical advantage. Polycrystalline of OFHC with
ultra-grain in fatigue crack propagated subject propagation rate change from high to low was
concluded in this study. The microstructures in front of crack tips after fatigue in specify rate/
cycles specimens were observed using BEI of SEM.
Experimental
A polycrystalline copper plate (99.95%) was used for this study. The specimens were
annealed at 800 oC for 4 hours in a 10-5 torr vacuum and then cooled in the furnace. The grain
sizes of the specimens were about 300-350m, as shown in Fig. 1. The specimen preparation
followed the ASTM E647 instruction for compact tension (CT) specimens. Fatigue crack
propagation were completed using a computerized Instron 8801 hydraulic testing machine at
R=0.1 (strain ratio, R=Pmin/Pmax) at a frequency of about 20 Hz.
widely mis-oriented cells when the load dropped from at crack propagation rate of 5x10-5
mm/cycle to 5x10-7 mm/cycle and keep fatigue to 1X104 cycles (Fig. 6). For the fatigue
cycles less than 1X104 cycles after dropped the fatigue loading, the dislocation structure is
not only exhibits mis-orientation cells but also the range is more extensively. Fig. 7 reveals
that the dislocation structure is also mis-orientation cells after dropped the fatigue loading to
hold fatigue to 3X104 cycles. However, the mis-orientation cells dislocation structure near the
crack tips is loss. The fatigue to 5X104 cycles after dropped the loading, the dislocation
structures show in Fig. 8. It is also mis-orientated cells. However, the fatigue cycles keep to
1X105 cycles after the dropped loading, the dislocation is difference among of above. It
shows that the dislocation structures near the crack tips reveal cells, walls, PSBs, vein and
loop patches structures (Fig. 9). For the 3X105 cycles after dropped the loading, the
microstructure in front of the crack tips shows in Fig. 10. The dislocation structure is loop
patches near by the crack tips region. Continue fatigue to 1X106 cycles after dropped loading,
the dislocation structures ahead of the crack tips is also loop patches nothing but the area is
enlarged (Fig.11). The fatigue cycle prolong to about 1.7X106 cycles, the crack re-
propagating and accompany the dislocation structure in front of the crack tips shows in Fig.
12. It is revealed that the microstructures are the cells, slip bands emerge in loop patches and
loop patches structure extend to outer grains.
Discussions
The dislocation structures in front of the crack tips at various rate of crack propagation are
observation in Figs. 3 to 5. Based on the Huang et. al. [25] indicated that the dislocation
structure next the crack tips is cells no matter the propagation rate is. The result is consistence
of this statement. However, the result of Huang [25] is study by means smaller grain size of
average, but this study is used large grain size of average. This advantage is that the
dislocation structure in front of crack tips is non-effect on grain boundary. According to this
study results reveal that it is almost occupied by mis-orientated cells when the rate of crack
propagation is larger than about 5X10-5mm/cycle (Fig.3), the dislocation structure exhibits
a sequence of mis-orientation cells, cells, MPSBs, veins and loop patches at 5X10-6mm/cycle
of crack propagation rate (Fig.4), and the loop patches structure dominants ahead of the
crack tips except a small area cells structure neighbor the crack tips when the rate is smaller
than 5X10-7mm/cycle (Fig. 5). This result indicates that the accumulation plastic strain is too
enough large and board to the other dislocation structure can not be observed when the crack
rate is larger than 5X10-6mm/cycle. Relatively, the accumulation plastic strain is too small to
the cells dislocation structure next the crack tip s region is narrow, and dominate
microstructure is loop patches at the crack rate is less than 5X10-7mm/cycle. It is moderated
crack propagation rate at 5X10-6mm/cycle because the dislocation procession of evolution is
integration can be examined in this study. . Based on these results, the using fatigue crack
propagation to investigate the dislocation positive evolution is more suitable. It is not only the
almost all dislocation structure can be observed ahead of the crack tips but also to make sure
the sequence of development at a experiment. At the same time, the amplitude of plastic
strain distribution near crack tip is verification when the result compare to the literatures of
about low cycles fatigue.
Foundation the Huang [29] reports, the dislocation re-evolution had studied in low cycle
fatigue for pure copper subject high-low loading condition. The result indicated that the
dislocation mis-oriented cells created by high loading transfer forward to loop patches
structure which is low loading condition balance structure. At the same time, Huang et. al.
[31] is also researched the crack tips with a steady rate subject to a high peak loading for CT
of pure copper specimen. Additional, the crack tips subject to a high-low loading condition
for CT pure copper specimen to investigate dislocation structure evolution was reported [32].
Figs 10 and 11 show the microstructure closed crack tips is loop patches structure when
fatigue to 3x105 and 1x106 cycles after dropped loading. Both of them, the loop patches
structure occupied region is extended, even to neighbor grain. To examine the dislocation
structure, the magnification of Fig. 11(b) is shown in Fig. 15. It is no doubtful that the
microstructure is loop patches structures in Fig 15. Fig. 12 indicates the dislocation structure
ahead of the crack tips fatigue to crack re-propagating after dropped the loading (i. e.
decrease the rate of crack from about 5X10-5 to 5X10-7 mm/cycle). To compare with Figs. 5
and 12, the dislocation structure in front of the crack tips is similar. Nevertheless, one is
steady rate of propagation condition, and other one is rate of crack propagation from high
decreased to low. In other worlds, one microstructure is evolution is step by step and the other
one is a jump from high to low rate of crack propagation. This mean is imply that the
dislocation structure closed crack tips is similar at the same rate of crack tips regardless the
path of process. Based on above, the dislocation structure re-evolution is making sure.
Conclusions
The dislocation in front of the crack tips at various rate of crack propagation or
re-evolution after dropped loading ( i. e. decreased the crack propagation rate from about
5x10-5 to 5x10-7mm/cycles) were investigated in this study. Although this the similar results
no matter the grain size in spite of the grain boundaries strain localization affected, it is more
easy and obvious to analysis the process of the dislocation structure re-development. There
conclusions of this study are list in following;
1. Once the crack tips with the same rate of the crack propagation, the dislocation structure
ahead of the crack tips is similar regardless the loading history. In other words, the
dislocation structure in front of the crack tips is function of the crack propagation rate and
independent of the loading path.
1. For the polycrystalline pure copper with ultra-grain size in this study, the dislocation
structure is mis-oriented cells dominated next the crack tips when the crack propagation
rate is larger than 5x10-5 mm/cycle. The crack propagation rate is smaller than
5x10-7mm/cycle, the dislocation structure is loop patches structure dominated next the
crack tips. Meaning, The dislocation structure in front of the crack tips reveals a sequence
of mis-oriented cells, walls, MPSBs, veins structure and loop patches structure distance
away from the crack tips to outer at the crack propagation rate is about 5x10-6 mm/cycles
range.
2. The dislocation evolution is anti-sequence between positive and negative. Meaning, the
mis-oriented structure formation is that in cells structure creat a new PSBs system in
positive evolution. Similarly, the mis-orientation cells transferred to cells structure is also
operated by a new PSBs system in negative development.
3. Since the larger grain size with higher fatigue saturation stress and its dislocation is
developed more uniform, the dislocation structure in front of crack tips is easy to observe.
Additional, the loop patches structure was observed closed the crack tips at 3x105 and
1x106 cycles after dropped the fatigue loading. Based on above, the dislocation, it is
more ensure that the dislocation structure development process under decreased loading is
re-evolution the dislocation structure to balance the loading condition and then positive
evolution the dislocation structure.
