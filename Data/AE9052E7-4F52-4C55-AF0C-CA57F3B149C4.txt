I Introduction 
Low-molecular weight organic matters, such as resorcinol, phloroglucinol, and 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid, are considered organic precursors with high DBPs formation potential in 
the chlorination process. However, the removal efficiency of these low molecular organic matters 
is insignificant in the traditional water treatment process, such as coagulation. Ozone is a strong 
oxidant which has been used in water and waste water industries for pathogen control. Taiwan 
began using ozone for water treatment in 2004. 
In order to decrease the THMs and HAAs formation in the chlorination process, ozonation 
process is employed as an alternating method in the European and American countries. Reports 
indicate that ozone is effective in reducing THMs and HAAs formation because of its strong 
oxidative ability. Further, ozone can decompose itself to form hydroxyl radical which is a strong 
oxidant. However, ozone may produce DBPs while reacting with organic and inorganic matters in 
water. Bromate, aldehydes, and other DBPs were found and investigated during the ozonation 
process. The USEPA promulgated drinking water standards to regulate DBPs, and requires that 
maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for bromate must be less than 0.01 mg/L. With the above 
controversy, this study is intended to combine pre-ozonation (O3/UV) and chlorination 
technology to achieve the purpose of reducing DBPs formation. 
 
II Objective 
1. Determine the hydroxyl radical formation in ozonation and O3/UV processes and 
evaluate the effects of hydroxyl radical and ozone molecule on the removal of organic 
precursor and on the DBP formation. 
2. Evaluate the inhibition of alkalinity on indirect ozonation process. 
3. Develop the ozone decay model and hydroxyl radical formation model. 
4. Assess the effects of bromide and ammonia on bromate formation and develop the 
bromate formation model. 
5. The difference of the chlorine decay rate and DBPs formation potential between 
pre-ozonation (O3/UV) and coagulation process was assessed. 
6. The predictive model for determining chlorine decay, and THMs and HAAs formation 
was developed for combining pre-ozonation (O3/UV) and chlorination.

n: the number of reaction order 
According to Yurteri and Gurol study (1988), the reasonable value of the self-decomposition 
coefficient (KD) at pH 7 is between 0.16 and 0.36.  
In the reaction between NOMs and ozone, the reaction rates for individual compounds were 
reported as first order with respect to the concentrations of ozone ([O3]) and organic matter ([M]) 
shown in Equation 3.2.3 (Langlais et al., 1991).

Organic compounds react with ozone molecules, in addition to hydroxyl radical generated 
by the decomposition of ozone at different operation condition. The reaction mechanism can be 
summarized by four main reactions listed below (Guittonneau et al., 1996):

     This reaction mechanism mainly involves direct ozone reaction (Md), initiator matter 
reaction (Mi), promoter matter reaction (Mp) and scavenger matter reaction (Ms). According to 
these equations, the Equation 3.2.3 could be rewritten as Equation 3.2.8.

Indirect Ozone Process 
At higher pH, ozone reacts with hydroxyl ions (OH-) as a catalyst and yields many kinds of 
free radicals such as ˙OH, O2-˙, and HO2-˙ etc., which is called indirect ozone process. The most 
commonly reported radicals in indirect ozone process was hydroxyl free radical (˙OH) (Staehelin 
and Hoigné, 1982). The characters of higher oxidative ability and nonselective reaction property 
result in a faster reaction rate and a higher removal efficiency of organic matters by ozonation.  
The substitution and addition reaction in the reaction of ozone with aromatic ring are found 
in direct ozone process. But because of the nonselective attack of hydroxyl radical the reaction of 
hydroxyl radical with aromatic ring is random. The aromatic ring with —OH groups under the 
attack of hydroxyl radical would lead to ring cleavage and to the formation of organic products 
such as formic acid, C2-C6 dicarboxylic acid, and aldehyde (Gilbert, 1978). The reaction between 
hydroxyl radical and organic compounds could be divided into three different mechanisms 
including hydroxyl addition, hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer (Huang et al., 1993) 
shown in Figure 3.2.2. 
 
Figure 3.2.2 Reaction of hydroxyl radical with organic pollutant (P) leading to a great diversity of 
oxidized compounds. P: pollutant; Pi: i species of P; oxid: oxidized compounds; NOM: natural 
organic matter (Hoginé, 1998). 
O3/UV Process 
The advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) are an oxidative process based on the generation 
of powerfully reactive and oxidative free radical, especially hydroxyl radicals. These free radicals 
are highly effective for removing refractory organics from water and wastewater (Patrik et al., 
2000; Tezcanli-Guyer and Ince, 2004). Generally, the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) 
induced free radicals reaction including the use of ultraviolet light (UV) in the presence of 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone, fenton’s reagent and a semi-conductor surface (Keiichi et 
al., 1996; N.H. Ince et al., 1999). Recently, ozone and other AOPs, such as O3/UV process, have 
been investigated to reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and trihalomethane

According to Schechter and Singer study (1995), the hydrophobic organic matters exhibit 
higher aldehyde formation potential than hydrophilic matters in ozonation. Generally, the 
common aldehydes found in ozonation are including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, and 
methyl glyoxal (Weinberg et al., 1993; Gracia et al., 1996). It has been reported that the order of 
aldehyde formation concentration in the reaction between ozone and organic matter is: 
formaldehyde > glyoxal > acetaldehyde > methyl glyoxal > C3-C10 monoaliphatic aldehyde 
(Weinberg and Glaze, 1996). 
The formation of aldehyde is caused by the reaction between ozone and the unsaturated 
organic matters in ozonation. The formation mechanism is via the additional reaction on 
unsaturated bonds of organic matters as shown in Equation 3.2.23.

Hoigné, 1994). 
 
Figure 3.2.6 Bromate formation during ozonation in the presence of ammonia (Pinkernell and von 
Gunten, 2001). 
 
(2) Ammonia 
The presence of ammonia during the ozonation process reduces the formation of bromate. In 
general, source water often contains low ammonia concentration. Therefore, many scholars 
discuss and experiment on the level of ammonia concentration affecting bromate formation. (von 
Gunten et al., 1994; Song et al., 1997) 
To treat ozonated drinking water with ammonia to form bromamine (NH2Br) is a good 
strategy (Haag and Hoigné, 1985; Siddiqui et al., 1995). In principle, the addition of ammonia 
prevents bromate formation by two pathways: First, ammonia reacts with OH radicals (OH 
radicals are formed from ozonation) at a faster rate than bromide, thus minimizing the formation 
of OBr-. Second, when the bromide-containing water is treated with ozone, free available 
bromine (FAB) species such as bromine, hypobromous acid, and hypobromite ion are formed 
(Gordon et al., 2002). 
Ammonia may be added to water by ozonation which may react with FAB to form NH2Br 
 20 
methional and hydroxyl radical by GC and determine the hydroxyl radical formation 
concentration. 
3. Fluorescence Method 
This fluorescence method is based on the hydroxylation of coumarin-3-carboxylic 
(3-CCA) and produces 7-hydroxyl- coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (7-OHCCA), a fluorescent, 
stable and specific product. Based on the fluorescence of 7-OHCCA, the hydroxyl radical 
formation concentration can be calculated accordingly (Karin and Stefan, 2002). 
4. Vivo Method 
The salicylic acid is commonly used to the hydroxyl radical trapping reagent in vivo. 
The resulting stable products include 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), 
2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and catechol analyze in HPLC-ECD. Given these 
products concentrations, the hydroxyl radical formation concentration can be determined (Wu, 
2002). 
 
3-4 Chlorination and DBP Formation 
Chlorination 
Because of its effectiveness in oxidation and disinfection, chlorine is a popular disinfectant 
in water treatment plant, especially in Taiwan. While chlorine dissolves in aqueous solution, it 
would undergo a rapid hydrolysis reaction to form two products, i.e., hypochlorous acid (HOCl) 
and hypochlorite (OCl-). The speciation of chlorine in aqueous solution is governed by following 
three principal reactions. (Cotton et al, 1972) 
+−× ++ →+ − HClHOClOHCl MK )1094.3(22 221           (3.4.1)

−−  →+ − 3)18.0(2 13 ClClCl MK                       (3.4.3) 
From the above equations, the composition of HOCl and OCl- of chlorinated solution varies 
as a function of pH and the concentration of Cl-. At low Cl- concentration, hydrolysis reaction of 
Cl2 goes on completely and produces more HOCl, OCl- and less Cl3-. However, HOCl is a major 
component in acidic and neutral solutions, and OCl- exists in a basic solution. These two species 
(HOCl and OCl-) would proceed to addition and substitution reaction with organic precursor to 
form chlorination by-products such as THM and HAA because of their electrophilic character 
(Boyce et al, 1983). 
Disinfection By-Products (DBPs) Formation

Hass and Karra (1984) proposed a model parallel first-order reaction model to evaluate the 
chlorine decay shown in Equation 3.5.3.

reaction; KR is the first-order rate constant for rapid reactions (h-1); and, KS is the first-order rate 
constant for slow reactions (h-1).  
According to the earlier studies, DBPs formation was corresponding to chlorine demand. 
Therefore, the rate coefficients determined from chlorine decay model were used to predict the 
DBPs formation. As shown in Equation 3.5.4, assuming the DBPs formation is direct proportion 
of the chlorine demand (Gang et al., 2003).

The physical and chemical properties of these three selected organic model compounds are 
listed in Table 4.2.1. 
4-3 Methods 
4-3-1 Experimental Design 
The experiment in the study was divided into two stages. The experimental detail design is 
shown in Table 4.3.1. In stage 1, take 5 liters Milli-Q water in a 25 oC bath and the ozone gas 
introduced to the water through a bubble diffuser bottom of the reactor for 2 hours before 
reaching an equilibrium concentration. The saturated ozone concentration in aqueous solution is 
about 18 mg/L.  
The preliminary test is conducted to add the blank water in the experiment and takes sample 
with following reaction time until 40 minutes to determine concentration of dissolved ozone, 
hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide. In addition, by adding the selected compounds of 
different pH levels, alkalinity, and bromide concentration changes the experimental conditions 
(pHs 5, 7 and 9) and maintains 40 minutes reaction time. The purpose of this ozonation process is 
to evaluate the removal of TOC and UV254, aldehyde, and bromate formation. An additive of 
alkalinity in ozonation is prepared by NaHCO3 at 60 mg/L as CaCO3 to evaluate the effect of 
alkalinity on ozonation process (Figure 4.3.1) 
It appears that batch ozone reaction is popular application for the reaction of low reactant 
concentration and fast reaction rate. In addition, it has a benefit to evaluate ozone reaction 
thoroughly and accurately. Therefore, the batch ozone reaction was chosen instead of the 
semi-batch ozone reaction for this study. 
The purpose of stage 2 (Figure 4.3.2) of this study is to evaluate the chlorine decay and 
chlorinated by-products formation in the chlorination followed by the ozonation process. A 
7-days chlorine demand study was introduced by 10mg/L chlorine dose to determine the chlorine 
consumption, trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), and haloacetic acid formation 
potential (HAAFP). Throughout these chlorination experiments, all samples were chlorinated by 
13% free chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) stock solution and add phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). 
Sample were chlorinated in 300 mL glass bottle and kept headspace free in the dark at room 
temperature (25±2 oC) until 168 hours. The samples were collected after 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, and 168 
hours contact time.

and an internal standard peak area (Ai) for each level; use these peak area to calculate the 
relative response for each HAA. Moreover, the relative standard deviation (% RSD) of 
selected experimental data is less than 10 %.

The kinetics constants for the two stages at pHs 5, 7, and 9 are listed in Table 5.1.1. The 
higher correlation coefficients (R2) shown in Table 5.1.1 indicate that Equations (5.1.2) express 
the ozone decomposition reaction very well. Figure 5.1.1 also presents the ozone decomposition 
reaction and predictive model at different pH levels, in which the dashed lines and solid lines 
denote the predictive data determined by the Slawomir model and Equations (5.1.2), respectively. 
The parameters F, kR, and kS were determined by non-liner regression software (SYSTAT 5.01).

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
It was reported that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) forms simultaneously in ozone 
decomposition during the rapid stage of the ozonation process (Buhler et al., 1984). According to 
the Guittonneau study (1996), low H2O2 concentration also increases the organic compound 
removal efficiency in ozonation. As a result, the effect of H2O2 formation was further study in 
this investigation. 
As shown in Figure 5.1.4, the formation of H2O2 increases as the reaction time. The 
formation concentration increases a maximum value within the first 30 minutes and gradually 
decreases afterwards. However, in the indirect ozonation process, hydroxyl radicals formed and 
reacted with H2O2 as shown in Equation 5.1.3, which results in a lower H2O2 concentration than 
that of the direct ozonation process.

5-1-5 Ozonation (O3/UV) of Organic Precursors in terms of TOC and UV254  
According to a Symon study (1990), it was suggested that the ratio of ozone dose and 
organic carbon (mg O3/mg C) should be maintained between 3~6 to achieve a better removal 
efficiency of chlorinated by products formation potential. Since the theoretical saturated ozone 
concentration in 25 oC is approximately 18 mg/L (Standard Method 19th) and the influent TOC 
concentration of three model compounds is at 3 mg/L, the ozone dose of 6 mg O3/ mg C was 
chosen for this experiment. Furthermore, the reaction time in ozonation and O3/UV system is 
operated for 40 minutes until the ozone concentration disappeared. 
Figure 5.1.13 presents the results of TOC removal efficiency in the ozonation and O3/UV 
processes. The removal efficiency of TOC for three model compounds in ozonation is below 6 %, 
especially at pH 9 (closed to zero). This evidence suggests that the electrophilic character of 
ozone could only oxidize and destroy a small amount of the aromatic structure and unsaturated 
bond of organic matter without mineralizing the organic carbon to form carbon dioxide as well as 
the destruction by hydroxyl radical. Therefore, the reduction of these organic precursors in the 
ozonation process is very limited. 
The removal efficiency of TOC for three model compounds was found to be over 40 % in 
the O3/UV process, which indicates that the higher hydroxyl radical exposure can mineralize 
organic carbon to form carbon dioxide. It also suggested that hydroxyl radical exposure is an 
important factor to evaluate the TOC removal efficiency in the ozonation and O3/UV processes. 
The effect of alkalinity on the removal of TOC also was presented in Figure 5.1.13, which 
indicates that the natural inhibitor (alkalinity) could be negligible because of the insignificant 
removal efficiency of TOC in the ozonation process. 
Organic compound with aromatic structure or with conjugated double bonds would absorb 
light in the ultraviolet wavelength range, commonly 254 nm (UV254). Figure 5.1.14 illustrates the 
removal efficiencies of UV254 for the model compounds in the ozonation and O3/UV processes. 
The value of UV254 decreases below 0.01, which is close to the detection limit of UV254 measured 
by a Spectrophotometer. Therefore, the removal efficiency of UV254 is up to 96 % in both the 
ozonation and O3/UV processes, which indicates that the ozone and hydroxyl radical would 
destroy the most aromatic structure and conjugated double bonds to form ozonation by-product 
such as aldehyde and carboxylic acid resulting in the low value of UV254. 
The effect of alkalinity on the removal of UV254 is also shown in Figure 5.1.14, which 
indicates that hydroxyl radical formation concentration in the presence of inhibitor also can 
destroy the most aromatic structure and conjugated double bonds. Therefore, the effect of 
alkalinity on UV254 removal is negligible. 
As shown in Figures 5.1.13 and 5.1.14, the difference in between TOC and UV254 removal 
for three model compounds is insignificant, because of the similar benzene structure in three 
model compounds, which the attack of ozone following Criegee mechanism and the nonselective 
reactivity of hydroxyl radical result in having the similar TOC and UV254 removal.

5-1-6 Formation of Ozonation By-products 
According to a Glaze study (1986), the ozonation by-products include aliphatic aldehyde, 
hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxide, and saturated carboxylic acid. Among them, aldehyde is the 
most concerned because it is harmful to human health. Aldehyde consists of formaldehyde, 
acetaldehyde, glyoxal, and methyl glyoxal that are commonly found in ozonation. 
Figures 5.1.16 shows the formation of the ozonation by-product (aldehyde) for resorcinol, 
phloroglucinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid at different levels of pH and alkalinity treated by the 
ozonation and O3/UV processes. In this study, the principal aldehyde formation is formaldehyde, 
especially at high pH. For instance, at pH 9 the ratio of formaldehyde formation in aldehyde 
formation is up to 70 %, while at pH 7 is 50 %, and pH 5 is 39 % in resorcinol. This formation 
suggests that hydroxyl radical (formed at pH 9) could destroy organic compound generate shorter 
chain by-products such as formaldehyde than ozone molecule (formed at pH 5). As shown in 
Figure 5.1.16, addition of alkalinity would decrease the aldehyde concentration in the indirect 
ozone process. The phenomenon conforms to previous finding, which state that alkalinity could 
reduce hydroxyl radical concentration to inhibit oxidation reaction and result in less aldehyde 
formation. 
As shown in Figure 5.1.17, the amount of aldehyde formation is proportionate to hydroxyl 
radical formation, i.e., hydroxyl radical formation promotes the aldehyde formation. The order of 
the aldehyde formation concentration is O3 (pH 9) > O3 (pH 7) > O3 (pH 5).  
In the O3/UV process, the higher hydroxyl radical exposure removes TOC by 40 % and 
further oxidization results in lowering aldehyde concentration to 2 µg/L. Therefore, the O3/UV 
process reduces the level of harmful aldehyde in water treatment. In summary, the order of 
aldehyde formation with respect to the ozonation process is O3 (pH 9; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 9; Alk 
=60) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=60) > O3 (pH 5) > O3/UV.  It was thus concluded that

The relationships between bromide reduction and bromate formation are shown in Figure 
5.2.3 which reveals that bromate formation increased with increasing bromide reductions. 
However, both of the bromate formation and bromide reduction are varied with the ozone doses 
(9.0 and 7.0 mg/L). Both the bromate formation and bromide reduction measured at 9.0 mg/L of 
ozone dose are higher than those at 7.0 mg/L. Therefore, the effect of different ozone dose on 
bromate formation and bromide reduction are significant.  
Figure 5.2.3 also shows bromate formation percentages (total bromate formation / total 
bromide reduction) which reveal that the bromate formation percentages increased with 
increasing initial bromide concentrations. Therefore, the effect of bromide concentration on 
bromate formation is significant and the increasing bromide concentration increases the bromate 
formation.

The chlorine decay constants for three model compounds for parallel first and second order 
reaction in the ozonation (O3/UV)/chlorination process are listed in Table 5.3.2. In the 
ozonation/chlorination processes, the rate constants for rapid reaction (KR) are higher than those 
of the slow reaction (KS) for these compounds, which suggests that the reaction proceeds rapidly 
in the beginning as KR, and is followed by a slow reaction afterwards as KS. Comparison of KR 
value between the different pH levels, the KR value increases with increasing pH, which indicates 
that the ozonated sample by hydroxyl radical result in a faster chlorine decay rate than that by the 
ozone molecule. In the presence of alkalinity, the inhibition resulted in the decreases of the KR 
values. However, the predicted value of KR and KS in the O3/UV process is different from that of 
the ozonation process. The value of KR (0.001) is smaller than KS (3.878 ~ 3.931) for three model 
compounds. In summary, the order of KR in the ozonation and O3/UV processes is O3 (pH 9; 
Alk=0) > O3 (pH 9; Alk=60) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=60) > O3 (pH 5)>> O3/UV. 
The lower chlorine demand at high pH resulted in lowering f in the ozonation (O3/UV) / 
chlorination process as shown in Table 5.3.2. In the presence of alkalinity, the inhibition would 
increase the value of f. Therefore, the order of f is O3 (pH 5) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=60) > O3 (pH 7; 
Alk=0) > O3 (pH 9; Alk=60) > O3 (pH 9; Alk=0) >> O3/UV. The deviation between the 
experimental data and predictive model, and the chlorine decay constants from a combination of 
three model compounds are listed in Table 5.3.3. It is noted that the low derivation (Table 5.3.3) 
and high correlation coefficient (Table 5.3.2) indicates the parallel first and second order chlorine 
decay model can accurately simulate the low-MW organic precursors in the ozonation (O3/UV) / 
chlorination processes. Figure 5.3.3 shows the residual chlorine concentration for resorcinol, 
phloroglucinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid at various reaction times and the predictive curve of 
the model, in which the plots are observed data, and the solid lines are predictive data for the 
predictive model. 
 
5-4 DBP Formation and Predictive Model  
5-4-1 THM formation   
    Chlorination of natural organic matter results in the formation of various chlorinated 
by-products. Trihalomethanes (THMs) are considered the major chlorinated by-products 
including chloroform (CHCl3), dichlorobromomethane (CHCl2Br), chlorodibromomethane 
(CHClBr2), and Bromoform (CHBr3). In this investigation, the THM formation for resorcinol, 
phloroglucinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid, which was pretreated by the ozonation and O3/UV 
 64 
Table 5.3.3 Deviation between the experimental data and predictive model 
 
The high TOC removal, high chlorine consumption, and less THM formation are found in 
the O3/UV process. This suggests that TOC is a major parameter in evaluating THM formations, 
i.e., a high TOC removal results in less THM formations. However, the relationship between 
chlorine consumption and THM formations found by Boyce (1983) is not consistent with the 
experimental data in the O3/UV process of this study, i.e., the higher chlorine consumption 
correspond to lower THM formation in the comparison between ozonation and O3/UV processes. 
The order of THM formation potentials (THMFP) is O3 (pH 9; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 9; Alk=60) > O3 
(pH 7; Alk=0) ?O3 (pH 7; Alk=60) >> O3 (pH 5) > O3/UV process. 
The comparisons of THM formation potentials with these three organic precursors are listed 
in Table 5.4.1. The similar benzene structure of three model compounds destroyed by ozone and 
hydroxyl radical generates the insignificant difference of THM formation (Gilbert et al., 1976). 
This evidence was validated further by analyzing the data presented in Table 5.4.2 via the 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) — F test method. The assumption of H0: difference of THM 
formations among the three model compounds is insignificant. In Table 5.4.2, F-test is 0.0012 < F 
(2, 12) = 2.8068. Therefore, the assumption is accepted and the difference of THM formation 
among the three model compounds is insignificant.

Other important indexes for predicting THM formation are specific THMFP (µg THM / mg 
TOC) and α (µg THM / mg Cl2 consumed) as also listed in Table 5.4.1. Specific THMFP is used 
to evaluate the effect of TOC on THMFP. Because of the low TOC removal in the ozonation 
process, the value of specific THMFP is correlated to THMFP, and the order of the specific 
THMFP is O3 (pH 9; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 9; Alk=60) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 7; Alk=60) >> 
O3 (pH 5). The value of α indicates THM formations is derived from per unit of Cl2 consumed, 
called THM yield coefficient. The THM yield coefficient is an common index to determine the 
THM formation potential (Gang, 2002). The order of α is O3 (pH 9; Alk=0) > O3 (pH 9; Alk=60) 
> O3 (pH 7; Alk=0) >O3 (pH 7; Alk=60) >> O3 (pH 5). Because of the low level of THM 
formations in the O3/UV process, the specific THMFP and α are the smallest value among all the 
processes. It also indicates that the O3/UV process has the least THMFP and the O3 (pH 9; Alk=0) 
process has the highest THMFP.

acid is higher than those observed for resorcinol and phloroglucinol. This suggests that the 
specific –COOH groups promote the HAA formation. This hypothesis might be verified by 
analyzing the data presented in Table 5.4.4 via the analysis of variance (ANOVA) — F test 
method. The assumption of H0: difference of HAA formation among the three model compounds 
is insignificant. In Table 5.4.3, F-test is 0.0094 < F (2, 12) = 2.8068. Therefore, the assumption is 
accepted and difference of HAA formation among the three model compounds is insignificant. 
The order of the two important indexes for HAA formation, specific HAAFP, and β, is 
consistent with the order of the THM formation also listed in Table 5.4.3. Therefore, the O3 (pH 9; 
Alk=0) process has the highest HAAFP and the O3/UV process has the lowest. 
 
5-4-3 DBP formation 
The chlorinated THMs and HAAs are considered as the principal DBPs formation in 
chlorination process (Xie, 2004). The DBPs formation curve for resorcinol, phloroglucinol, and 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid is shown in Figure 5.4.3. The formation curve is similar to THM and 
HAA formation (Figures 5.4.1 and 5.4.2). 
The relationship between DBPs formation and chlorine consumption at 168 hours reaction 
time is shown in Figure 5.4.4. The negative correlation exists between chlorine consumption and 
DBPs formation, which indicates that under the similar TOC concentration, the organic structure 
is a major parameter on the DBPs formation, and the chlorine consumption is not corresponded to 
DBPs formation at any situation (Boyce and Horning, 1983). The comparison between DBPs 
formation and pH at 168 hours experiment is also shown in Figure 5.4.4. The positive correlation 
between pH and DBPs formation concludes that the hydroxyl radical promotes the DBPs 
formation and ozone molecule inhibits the DBPs formation. 
Comparison of DBPs formation in chlorination process between with and without ozonation, 
the ozone and hydroxyl radical could change the properties in the three model compounds via 
destroying the aromatic structure, which leads to more reductions of chlorine demand and CBPFP 
than those in the only chlorination process. The DBPs formation concentration in the only 
chlorination process is followed by P>>PHBA>R. The more electrophilic –OH group of 
phloroglucinol have lower pKa and increase the addition and substitution reactions by chlorine, 
which yields approximately 2-fold CBPs formation potential than resorcinol and 
p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Therefore, the distribution of various species of CBPs also depended on 
the acidity (pKa) and the characteristic of the substrate in solution (Gallard and Gunten, 2002).

The comparisons of DBPs formation potential with these three organic precursors are listed 
in Table 5.4.5. The phenomenon is corresponded to the chlorine consumption for three model 
compounds. The similar benzene structure for three model compounds resulted in the 
insignificant difference of DBPs formation in the ozonation (O3/UV)/ chlorination process. The 
above evidence can be validated further by analyzing the data presented in Table 5.4.6 via the

5-4-4 Predictive DBP Formation Model  
Model development 
According to the predictive model (Gang et al., 2003), the DBP formation is proportional to 
chlorine demand which is expressed as follows:  
)( 0 CCDDBP −= , [ )/(
)/(
LmgDemandChlorine
LgDBPFPD µ= ]      (5.4.1) 
Based on the assumption of Equation 5.3.1, the DBP predictive model is derived as: 
             })1(1{0
tKtK SR efefCDDBP ⋅−⋅− ⋅−−⋅−⋅⋅=           (5.4.2) 
Recently, the modified the chlorine decay model, which also uses the chlorine decay model 
to predict the THM, HAA and DBP formation. The Equations 5.4.3 to 5.4.5 assume that the THM, 
HAA and DBP formation are a function of chlorine consumption with respect to the rapid and 
slow reaction (Chang et al., 2006):

In the model, the n and m are different from the selected model compounds. However, the 
investigation assumes that the THM, HAA and DBP formation is the second order to chlorine 
consumption in the rapid reaction and the first order to chlorine consumption in the slow reaction 
is consistent to the assumption of chlorine consumption in the chlorination process. Therefore, 
the predictive model for THM, HAA and DBP formation in the investigation is followed as (n=2;

The relationship between DBP formation and chlorine demand could be evaluated by the 
DBP yield coefficient (D). Table 5.5.3 shows the values of D in different processes. In the only 
chlorination process experiment, the high DBP formation is corresponded to high chlorine 
consumption. Therefore, the D value in the only chlorination process is not obviously higher than 
that in the ozonation (O3/UV) / chlorination process.

5-5-3 Risk Assessment 
During this study, it was found that ozonation of organic precursors is successful in reducing 
the DBP formation in chlorination, especially at pH 5 for the ozonation and the O3/UV processes. 
However, it is noted that there are other by-products harmful to human health, such as aldehyde 
would be occurred in the course of ozonation. Therefore, it is required to a risk assessment to 
determine if the ozonation (O3/UV) process is an appropriate treatment process based on the 
carcinogenic DBPs concerns. 
Figures 5.5.1 to 5.5.3 illustrate the DBP and aldehyde formations in the only chlorination 
and ozonation (O3/UV) / chlorination processes. The DBP (THM and HAA) and aldehyde are 
considered carcinogenic substances by USEPA, and its carcinogenic risk can be determined by

on by-products formation but the less hydroxyl radical (indirect ozonation) would promote the 
by-products formation. 
In the only chlorination process, the selected model compounds with different functional 
group and electrophile character resulted in unlike chlorine demand, THMs, and HAAs formation. 
The order of these is P>>R?PHBA. However, in the ozonation (O3/UV)/chlorination processes, 
the similar structure formed under the ozone and hydroxyl radical attack would have the similar 
chlorine demand, THM, and HAAs formation. Therefore, the difference of chlorine demand, 
THM, and HAAs formation for the selected model compounds is insignificant in the ozonation 
(O3/UV)/chlorination processes. 
In the ozonation process, the carcinogenic bromate formation is the other important study in 
this investigation. Because the ozone dose is not sufficient to react with bromide to form 
hypobromous acid resulting in reducing the bromate formation, the effect of ammonia 
concentration on reducing bromate formation is insignificant in this investigation. Since the 
ammonia could be oxidized to nitrate by ozonation, the fraction of the ammonia attributed to 
reducing the bromate formation in ozonation should be identified. 
According to the risk assessment between the ozonation (O3/UV)/chlorination processes, 
and only chlorination process, the highest and lowest risks were found in the only chlorination 
and O3/UV processes, respectively. The results of this investigation could be utilized to the water 
treatment plants by introduction of the ozonation and O3/UV processes prior to the chlorination 
process 
The predictive model proposed by Gang (2002) can not fit the experimental data of THM, 
and HAAs formation in the ozonation / chlorination processes in this investigation. However, the 
modified predictive model (Chang et al., 2006) based on the parallel first-order (slow reaction) 
and second-order (rapid reaction) reactions in chlorine consumption can fit the chlorine decay 
quite well. In the DBP predictive model, the assumption of the DBP formation corresponded to 
the second order to chlorine consumption in the rapid reaction and the first order to that in the 
slow reaction (n=2, m=1) exhibits the high correlation coefficient (good fit) in the study. 
Therefore, the modified model could predict the THMs and HAAs formation accurately and 
achieve the minimization formation purpose for the water treatment plant in the investigation.

coagulation. The type of OM in raw water is also a factor
aﬀecting its removal by coagulation. Functional groups
of OM inﬂuence the solubility of organic compounds;
hydrophobicOM is easier to be removed than hydrophilic
OM (Collins et al., 1986; White et al., 1997). Owen et al.
(1993) indicated that a large percentage of disinfection
by products (DBPs)was formed from the non-humic frac-
tion of NOM. This fraction is generally more hydrophilic
than humic substances and thus more diﬃcult to remove
by coagulation.
Polymers have particular advantages over inorganic
coagulants for NOM removal. The performance is less
pH dependent and there is a lower level of dissolved ions
in the product water. Mallevialle et al. (1984) found that
chlorination of polyacryamide (PAM) and acryamide
monomers shows low reactivity, and generated a small
amount of total organic halides (TOX) and trihalometh-
ane (THM). Chang et al. (1999) found that the polydial-
lyldimethyl ammonium chloride (p-DADMAC) not
only eﬀectively removed the turbidity but also reduced
the formation of THM. In evaluating cationic polyelec-
trolytes for the removal of UV absorbers, addition of
alum followed by cationic polymethacrylate, p-DAD-
MAC or cationic PAM (CPAM) was found to be eﬀec-
tive. A polymer with higher charge density (CD) is more
eﬀective in reducing UV absorbers than that with low
CD. p-DADMAC is not considered to be toxic and ac-
cepted for use in treatment of municipal water supplies
by USEPA. However, the USEPA acceptance is only
by the speciﬁc name of the suppliers and not by generic
type, the maximum dose for p-DADMAC is 10mgl1
(AWWA, 1987). PAM is a high molecular weight organ-
ic polymer and solute in water easily, and can resist the
attack from microbial (Seybold, 1994). Chronic environ-
mental studies indicated that no adverse eﬀects were dis-
covered in workers exposed to PAM dust over a period
of 5 years. It has also been known to be non-toxic to
human animals, and ﬁsh (Anonymous, 1991).
A thorough understanding of the reaction mecha-
nism is a necessary step in determining the proper type
of polymer to be used for the coagulation process. The
reaction of polymers with other chemicals such as disin-
fectants in the form of chlorine may adversely aﬀect the
success of the coagulation process. Therefore, the objec-
tives of this paper were intended to investigate the eﬀects
of three organics acids i.e., humic acid (HA), tannic acid
(TA) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) on coagula-
tion performance and THM formation potential as well
as to determine the most suitable polymer as a coagu-
lant-aid in the coagulation process.
2. Materials and methods
Three model organic compounds with diﬀerent molar
masses and degrees of hydrophobicity were used to sim-
ulate some of the wide range of organics found in NOM
(Exell and Vanloon, 2000). HA represents fairly hydro-
phobic, high-molar-mass (molecular weight (MW) = 10
to 100 thousands) natural compounds and is a nega-
tively charged polyelectrolyte due to the dominance of
carboxylic acid groups. A number of previous studies
have utilized this material; it represents a good model
humic substance (Chang et al., 2001; Mustafa and
Walker, 2001). TA represents relatively hydrophilic com-
pounds of medium molar mass (MW = 1700), and
PHBA (MW = 138) represents small organic molecules
found in nature. All of the model compounds containing
carboxylic and phenolic groups. Jar tests with rapid mix-
ing, followed by settling were conducted to evaluate the
eﬃciencies of the coagulant and coagulant-aid in remov-
ing these compounds and reducing turbidity, as well as
THM formation potential under various pH conditions.
2.1. Polymers
Two types of polyacryamide (SNF Co.) including
non-ionic PAM of high MW ranging from 5 to 15 mil-
lion, and CPAM of positively-charged, with CD < 15%
containing very high molecular weight (3 to 15 million)
were used in this study as coagulant aid. Another cat-
ionic polymer, p-DADMAC, which has a high CD
(100%) and varying MW was also used in this study.
2.2. Synthetic water
Synthetic water was made up to resemble the alkalin-
ity, turbidity, and OM (HA, TA, and PHBA) levels
of natural water. In 1 l of distilled water, sodium
bicarbonate was added to produce on alkalinity of
100 ± 10mgl1 as CaCO3, and 0.662mg bentonite was
added to obtain an approximate turbidity of 200
NTU. The DOC of the synthetic water prepared above
was near 7mgl1 as C. This solution was mixed on a stir
plate for 1h before being transferred to 21 l. The water
was then left in a closed container overnight (>18h)
and the pH was adjusted before it was used in jar tests.
2.3. Jar tests and analyses
All three coagulant-aids and each type of organic com-
pounds were used to compare the eﬀectiveness of each
coagulant-aid in removing various types of OM and tur-
bidity under diﬀerent pH condition. The alum used as a
coagulant that chemical formula was Al(SO4)3 Æ 18H2O
(Kento Chemical). The solutions with coagulant were
rapid-mixed at 100rpm for 3min, slow-mixed at 30rpm
for 15min, and allowed to settle for 20min. After comple-
tionofthesettlingprocess,supernatantsamplesweretaken
for measurement of turbidity via a turbidimeter (Hach).
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorine demand,
THM, pH, and alkalinity analyses were performed for
1142 E.-E. Chang et al. / Chemosphere 58 (2005) 1141–1150
chemical dosage is needed to destabilize the system
(Divakaran and Pillai, 2001).
The requirement of DOC removal for enhanced coag-
ulation suggested in the USEPA D/DBP Rules, provides
an operational procedure to establish a point of dimin-
ishing returns (PODR) which is deﬁned as the alum dos-
age beyond which <0.3mgl1 DOC is removed per
10mgl1 addition of alum in various jar tests. 35% of
DOC removal eﬃciency was set as an evaluation crite-
rion in this research. It could be seen from Fig. 1b that
the slope of DOC/alum became steeper over 100mgl1
of alum, therefore, 100mgl1 was the threshold dosage
for HA water. It was obvious that TA was relatively easy
to be removed by coagulation than HA. Alum has very
little eﬀects on PHBA removal at lower alum dosage,
although it could remove the turbidity quite successfully.
Since great amounts of coagulants were needed to
achieve DOC and turbidity removal requirements, vari-
ous polymers are chosen as coagulant aids to enhance
coagulation and reduce alum consumption. While treat-
ing HA water, the addition of CPAM could only reduce
turbidity slightly. Non-ionic PAM had better eﬃciency
in removing turbidity than CPAM (Table 1). It is be-
cause CPAM could neither adsorb positively charged
ﬂocs nor neutralize the charge of particles due to its
low CD. Contrarily, using p-DADMAC as coagulant-
aid, the residual turbidity could be reduced to a lower
level, even less than 1 NTU at higher dosages. For exam-
ple, an alum dosage of 20mgl1, 80% of turbidity was
removed with 8mgl1 of p-DADMAC for both TA
and HA. As alum dose increased, p-DADMAC addition
could reduce turbidity signiﬁcantly.
While treating PHBA water, both PAMs had better
eﬀects on enhancing the turbidity removal than treating
HA or TA water. Non-ionic PAM was still better than
CPAM in turbidity removal, but even at the highest
chemical dosage, 60mgl1 of alum and 10mgl1 of
non-ionic PAM, the residual turbidity of treated water
(41 NTU), was extremely higher than the Drinking
Water Quality Standard in Taiwan. About 5mgl1 of
p-DADMAC does reduce the turbidity of treated water
to lower than 2 NTU, regardless of the amount of alum
dosage. It was evident that the addition of p-DADMAC
had signiﬁcant improvement on turbidity removal.
Among three types of polymers, p-DADMAC exhib-
its the most eﬃcient performance for turbidity removal.
Comparing the properties of polymers, both PAMs had
higher molecular weight and lower CD than p-DAD-
MAC. The diﬀerence in coagulation performances
exhibited by the various type of polymer suggests that
the CD of a polymer should be more inﬂuential than
the molecular weight. In this investigation, it was found
that the organic composition in water would aﬀect the
eﬃciency of turbidity removal. The organic compounds
with complex structures and functional groups required
higher chemical dosages to produce suﬃcient positive
charged ﬂocs for turbidity removal by charge neutrali-
zation and adsorption. It was thus concluded that the se-
quence of the amounts of chemical needed for turbidity
removal be: HA > TA > PHBA.
Fig. 2 show DOC removal eﬃciencies for HA treated
with polymers. While treating HA water, p-DADMAC
is the only one to enhance the coagulation eﬃciency over
the threshold of enhanced coagulation requirement over
35% of DOC removal. Both cationic and non-ionic
PAM had little eﬀects on DOC removal. Moreover,
higher PAM dosage would remain in treated water
and result in higher residual of DOC concentration.

Since alum alone was not capable of removing
PHBA, diﬀerent polymers were dosed to improve the
coagulation performance. However, none of the poly-
mers used in this research could enhance coagulation
performance. It is evident that the hydrophilic property
and smaller molecular weight of PHBA could impede
the co-precipitation and adsorption of organic carbon
resulted in lowering reduction of DOC.
3.2. Eﬀect of pH adjustment on turbidity and DOC
removal for p-DADMAC
The pH adjustment with metal salt coagulants is an
important operating parameter for the coagulation pro-
cess. Adjusting the pH to the range between 4 and 5 are
generally believed to enhance the coagulation perfor-
mance with alum. The pH of synthetic water was ad-
justed to 5, 6, and 7 prior to coagulant addition. While
treating the HA water, p-DADMAC could help to re-
move most of the turbidity in water. At low alum dos-
age, e.g., 20mgl1, the coagulation eﬀects mainly were
contributed by p-DADMAC, however, pH eﬀect is not
signiﬁcant shown in Fig. 3a. When the alum dosage
was increased to 60mgl1, pH eﬀects became obvious.
As shown in Fig. 3b, the percent turbidity removal at
pH 5 is higher than that at pH 6 or 7. The addition of
p-DADMAC became useless at pH 5 due to the suﬃ-
cient alum and dosage. The role of p-DADMAC on
treating TA water is similar to that on treating HA
water. In general, the eﬀects of pH became obvious with
increasing alum dosage.
It was concluded that pH would aﬀect the perfor-
mance of alum in removing turbidity but not of p-
DADMAC. Therefore, low p-DADMAC dosage in
cooperation with high alum dosage would be aﬀected
by pH adjustment. Since a slight reverse of turbidity re-
moval was observed at high polymer dosage and low pH
for treating the above organic precursors, the dosage of
polymer must be controlled well in low pH conditions.
In Fig. 3c and d, it was observed that DOC removal
increased with decreasing pH value at 20mgl1 of alum
dosage. It took about 5mgl1 of p-DADMAC to
achieve the same percent DOC removal requirement at
pH 5, while higher dosage was needed at higher pH.

implied that charge density was a very speciﬁc character-
istic of polymer aﬀecting the performance of coagulation
process. While treating low turbidity water with p-DAD-
MAC, its high charge density narrowed the optimum
dosage and was impeditive to the performance of coag-
ulation. As a result, using polymer to treat low turbidity
water is not recommended.

leading to chlorination) or at the hydroxyl group (with loss
of chlorine). For example, p-hydroxybenzoic acid reacted
rapidly to generate a mixture which is side-chain cleavage
products of substitution and decarboxylation (Larson
and Rockwell, 1979). Boyce and Hornig (1983) conﬁrmed
that the conversion of 1,3-dihydroxyaromatic precursors
to THMs occurs in two stages. Extensive incorporation
of halogen by electrophilic substitution and addition pro-
cesses is followed by a complex series of hydrolysis and
decarboxylation steps, which lead to TCM via carbon–car-
bon bond cleavage about the C2 site of the aromatic ring.
In many research reports, mathematical models were
suggested to predict THM formation of speciﬁc source
water (Engerholm and Amy, 1983; Amy et al., 1987; Chang
et al., 1996; Gang et al., 2002). Gang et al. (2002) con-
structed a mathematical model of chlorine decay to predict
the THM formation. The authors (Gang et al., 2003) also
indicated that the THM formation in fractionated NOM
was a function of chlorine consumption. As the molecular
weight of the fraction decreased, THM yield coeﬃcients
increased. Katz (1986) suggested that the total organic car-
bon (TOC) had a strong correlation with chlorine demand,
particularly when turbidity was less than 20 NTU in the ﬁl-
trate. The eﬀect of chlorine demand on DBP formation is
generally not well known because NOM is composed of
many types of organics. Aromatics and humic substance
strongly react with chlorine that could be responsible for
the initial chlorine demand (Dotson and Helz, 1984).
Most organic matters contributing to major DBP pre-
cursors in source water of Taiwan are small compounds,
with a molecular weight of less than 1 KDa which was
measured by the ultraﬁltration membranes (Chang et al.,
2001; Chiang et al., 2002) However, only limited research
has been done on DBPs formation with diﬀerent functional
groups of small molecular aromatic compounds. The
objectives of this research were to: (1) develop the appro-
priate chlorine decay and DBP formation models for the
selected four model compounds; (2) investigate the forma-
tion potential of trichloromethane (TCM) and chloroacetic
acids (CAA) for the four model compounds; (3) evalu-
ate the relationship between CAA/TCM and chlorine
consumption with diﬀerent functional groups of model
compounds.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Sample preparation
Four model compounds with diﬀerent functional groups
of benzene i.e., carboxylic and phenolic groups were
selected in this investigation to represent small molecular
NOM. The four model compounds include phloroglucinol
(1,3,5-trihroxybenzene), resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene),
m-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), and p-hydroxybenzoic
acid (4-HBA). The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) con-
centrations for model compounds, using de-ionized water
(Milli-Q SP), were prepared and adjusted to approximately
3.0 (±0.2) mg/l as C. The characteristics of the model com-
pounds are listed in Table 1.
2.2. Evaluation of Chlorine consumption
A 7-day chlorine consumption study was performed
using 28 mg/l chlorine dosage (as Cl2), about 9 times the
DOC dosage, to determine the chlorine consumption, tri-
chloromethane formation potential (TCMFP), and chloro-
acetic acid formation potential (CAAFP). Throughout
these chlorination experiments, all samples were chlori-
nated by 13% free chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) stock
solution and added phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.0). A blank
sample was prepared using the same amount of deionized
ultra ﬁltered water, and chlorinated under the same condi-
tions as the other samples. Samples were chlorinated in 6
liter glass bottles and then carefully transferred into 150
amber glass bottles with Teﬂon-lined caps. A separate bot-
tle containing the four model compounds samples was used
for each reaction kinetic test. There were 12 experimental
data for 3-HBA, 4-HBA, resorcinol and phloroglucinol,

of chlorination. Since the phenolates (dissociated form of
phenols) from model compounds were responsible for the
fast reaction with chlorine, all water samples consumed
over 80% of the initial chlorine dose within the ﬁrst 3 h,
especially for the resorcinol, which had the highest chlorine
consumption rate at 10 min.
The parallel second and ﬁrst-order reaction model for
chlorine demand derived in this study is the best ﬁt as com-
pared with the parallel ﬁrst-order model (derived by Gang
et al., 2002), n-order chlorine decay model, parallel second
order and parallel ﬁrst order and second order. Table 2 pre-
sents the chlorine decay constants and ﬁtting parameters
for the model compounds. The chlorine data of hydroxy-
benzene and hydroxybenzoic acid in Fig. 2 ﬁt the model
well, yielding the correlation coeﬃcients of 0.985–0.991.
The constants of rapid decay rates (KR = 0.32–
5.05 l mg1 h1) in Table 2 were much higher than those
of the slow decay rates (kS = 0.006–0.028 h
1) for all model
samples. The values of kR for the hydroxybenzoic acids
were much smaller than those of the hydroxybenzene sam-
ples. The proportion constants (f) shown in Table 2 ranged
from 76% to 91% of the chlorine consumption. Diﬀerences
in the reaction kinetics observed between these four com-
pounds may be separated into two groups. For resorcinol
and phloroglucinol, the chlorine consumptions were higher
at ﬁrst and increased gradually afterwards; whereas for 3-
HBA and 4-HBA, chlorine consumptions were lower at
ﬁrst and increased rapidly afterwards.
Larson and Rockwell (1979) and Gallard and Gunten
(2002) revealed that resorcinol, with two activating –OH
groups, could release electrons rapidly, leading to the elec-
trophilic addition and substitution reactions while chlori-
nation was proceeding. Boyce and Hornig (1983) also
pointed out that when both OH groups on an aromatic
ring are located at an appropriated orientation to stabilize
the transition state of the reaction through the donation of
electron density, an electrophilic substitution mechanism
could easily occur. These observations suggest that the aro-
matic carbon site adjacent to the C1-hydroxyl group be
inverted to electrophilic substitution by chlorine. However,
phloroglucinol is highly symmetric and may form a reso-
nance-stabilized intermediate because of three –OH
groups. These three –OH groups may impede series of
hydrolysis as well as decarboxylation with C–C bond cleav-
age on the aromatic ring resulting in a lower kR value of
phloroglucinol (1.225 l mg1 h1) than that of resorcinol
(5.051 l mg1 h1).
As for hydroxybenzoic acids with moderately deactivat-
ing substituents (–COOH), the electron density on the ben-
zene ring would be lowered during the ionization process of
carboxyl group. The chlorination of carboxyl groups pro-
ceeds much slower than the chlorination of resorcinol
and phloroglucinol, which is because that hydroxybenzoic
acid reacts rapidly to give a decarboxylation product (Lar-
son and Rockwell, 1979). As for the chlorine consumption
rate between 3-HBA and 4-HBA, it was observed that
there was a higher value for 4-HBA because the p-position
of OH and COOH on the aromatic ring is more active than
the m-position of OH and COOH which facilitates the
chlorine reaction on hydroxybenzoic acid.
3.2. TCM, CAA and DBP formation kinetics and modeling
Since the chlorine decay model was determined as the
parallel second order (rapid reaction) and ﬁrst order (slow
reaction), the chlorine decay model could be simpliﬁed as:

The experimental data was inserted into the DBP forma-

the parallel third and ﬁrst order (R(3,1)) exhibits the

model compounds at diﬀerent order of reaction. In Table 5,
it was observed that there were two distinct patterns, i.e.,
hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA and 4-HBA) and hydroxyl
benzene (R and P), exhibited their respective reaction order
(n,m) and DBP yield coeﬃcient. Reckhow et al. (1990) also
found that the speciﬁc DBP formation was related to the
activated aromatic matter, whereas activated aromatic con-
tent was correlated with chlorine consumption. Gang et al.
(2003) reported that there was no strong correlation
between molecular weight and chlorine decay kinetics.
With the above evidence, it suggests the amount of DBP
generated be site-speciﬁc in practice, and the chlorine react-
ing mechanism be dependent on the nature of target com-
pounds in principle. In this study, although these four
small model compounds have their respective functional
group reacted with chlorine to form DBP, the DBP forma-
tion is actually simulated by a chlorine demand model. The
concept of DBP yield coeﬃcient was useful for quantifying
the diﬀerence in species production and evaluating the
eﬀect of organic precursor reduction.
3.3. Relationship between TCM and CAA
The speciﬁc chlorine demand (SCD) in Fig. 6 was
deﬁned as the ratio between the chlorine demand (mg/l)
and the initial DOC concentration (mg/l) at the reaction
times of 1, 3 and 168 h. In the ﬁrst hour, the SCD and spe-
ciﬁc DBPFP (DBP formation potential/DOC concentra-
tion) of hydroxybenzenes are slightly higher than those of
hydroxybenzoic acids, and the speciﬁc DBPFP of phloro-
glucinol was the highest among the four model com-
pounds. However, no relationships between speciﬁc
DBPFP and SCD of model compounds were observed
based on the limited data collected at various times.
Fig. 7 shows the relationship between TCM and CAA
formation potential of model compounds under diﬀerent
chlorination times (1, 3 and 168 h). After linear regression
of experimental data, a high correlation between CAA and
TCM concentration was observed. However, there are two
patterns of DBP correlation based on the slopes of linear
curves in Fig. 7. The hydroxybenzoic acids pattern pro-
duces a higher slope (>10) than that of the m-hydroxy
substituted compounds (slope <1). These observations sug-
gest that the aromatic carboxyl group has a strong correla-
tion to the formation of CAA (Cook and Langford, 1998;
Pomes et al., 1999). However, oxidative decarboxylation of
dihydroxybenzoic acid was not observed which was consis-
tent with the ﬁndings suggested by Norwood et al. (1980).
Therefore, the formation of DBP is highly dependent on
the nature of the organic matter.
4. Conclusions
This study shows that the four model compounds of
small organic DBP precursors lead to high chlorine
demand and high DBP formation potential. The chlorine
degradation in model compounds with OH and/or COOH

Introduction 
In conventional water treatment, the use of chlorine for disinfection is quite popular in 
the world. Residual chlorine in the finished water is essential to ensure the safe 
drinking water without microorganism contaminants in the water distribution system. 
However, chlorine reacts with natural organic matters (NOMs) in water generating 
disinfection by-products (DBP). Among these DBP, trihalomethanes (THM) and 
haloacetic acids (HAA) are commonly found and investigated, which have been 
confirmed to be carcinogenic to human beings. 
The dominant organic precursors of THM formation in the water environment 
would be aquatic NOMs, mainly consist of humic substance (Bocye et al., 1983; Rook, 
1976).  However, aquatic humic substances are complicated by its uncertain 
chemical structure. Many studies have focused on the reaction of chlorine with simple 
organic species in humic substance. It had been reported that aliphatic carboxylic, 
hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, and pyrrole nitrogen derivatives were the main 
functional groups observed in the model compounds such as resorcinol, 
phloroglucinol, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (Richardson et al., 1999; Bocye et al., 
1983). Moreover, these simple organic matters are characterized as low-molecule 
DBP precursors, which are not effectively removed by the traditional water treatment 
processes (Chang, 2005).

hydroxyl radical formation in ozone and O3/UV processes, (2) evaluate the effects of 
hydroxyl radical and ozone molecule on the reduction of organic precursor and the 
removal of DBP formation concentration, (3) understand the inhibition of alkalinity 
on indirect ozonation process and (4) assess the difference and carcinogenic risk in 
DBP formation during chlorination process followed by the ozonation or O3/UV 
processes. In this investigation, the low-molecular weight organic matters, such as 
resorcinol, phloroglucinol, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid, were selected as organic 
precursors with high DBP formation potential during the ozonation and chlorination 
processes. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 Sample Preparation 
The characteristics of the selected model compounds including resorcinol (R), 
phloroglucinol (P), and p-hydroxylbenzoic acid (PHBA) are listed in Table 1. The 
experimental synthetic water was composed of total organic carbon (TOC) 3.0 ? 0.3 
mg/L for R, P, PHBA and were prepared with de-ionized water (Milli-Q SP). All 
chemicals for experimental analysis were prepared with de ionized water (Milli-Q 
SP). 
 
Experimental Procedures 
A glass reactor with an operation volume 5.0 L and free space 0.5 L was employed for 
ozonation process shown in Figure 1. It was equipped with a water jacket to maintain 
a constant temperature, 25 oC. Ozone was generated by bubbling oxygen in an ozone 
generator (Model SG-01A, Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan).

calibrated with the potassium hydrogen phthalate standard. The UV254 were analyzed 
by UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601, SHIMADZU) after filtering through a 
0.45 µm filter. The determination of hydrogen peroxide was performed by a 
spectrophotometric method using DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylene- diamine) (Bader, 
1988). The hydroxyl free radical is analyzed by a fluorometric method (Karin, 2002). 
Chlorine concentration was determined by DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylene- diamine) 
titration methods. All analyses, unless otherwise noted, were performed according to 
the 19th edition of the standard method (APHA, 1998). 
Aldehyde including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, and methyl glyoxal were 
derivatized to the corresponded oximes by o-(2,3,4,5,6 penta-fluorobenzyl)- 
hydroxylamine (PFBHA), which were microextracted with hexane and then analyzed 
in a GC/ECD system (Trace GC). THMs were analyzed in a GC/ECD system with 
purge and trap injection (HP 6890 series). The column in GC is a fused silica capillary 
column (method 6232, standard method 19th edition). HAAs were determined by a 
liquid-liquid extraction procedure (extracting with methyl tert-butyl ether) in a 
GC/ECD system, in accordance with USEPA methods 552.2. 
 
Results and Discussion 
This study of ozonation and O3/UV processes is divided into two phases. The 
preliminary test was performed to investigate the effects of hydroxyl radical and 
alkalinity on ozonation. Further, this study was focused on ozonation (O3/UV) of 
organic precursors and ozonation by-products formation. 
 
Ozonation Process at Different pH Levels

Where [O3] is the ozone concentration at time t (mg/L); [O3]0 is the initial ozone 
concentration; F is the fraction of the ozone consumption attributed to rapid reaction; 
K1 is the first-order rate constant for the rapid reaction (min-1); and, K2 is the 
first-order rate constant for the slow reaction (min-1). The parameters F, K1, and K2 
were determined by non-linear regression software (SYSTAT 5.01). Because the 
almost ozone decomposes in the rapid reaction at pH 9, the difference between rapid 
and slow reactions is insignificant. Therefore, the fraction of the ozone consumption 
attributed to the rapid reaction, F, at pH 9 is equal to 1, which indicates that there is 
only K1 rate constant existed in the modified model. 
The kinetic constants for these two stages at pH 5, 7, and 9 are listed in Table 2. 
The higher correlation coefficients (R2) shown in Table 2 indicate that Equation 2 
expresses the ozone decomposition reaction very well. Because the ozone 
consumption lacks the slow reaction at pH 9, the modified model based on rapid and 
slow reactions shows the worse correlation coefficient (R2) than that at pH 7. Figure 2 
also presents the ozone decomposition reaction and predictive data at different pH 
levels, in which the dashed lines and solid lines denote the predictive data determined 
by the Slawomir model and modified model, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the 
value of K1 increases with increasing pH value, which indicates ozone molecules 
decompose more rapidly in the beginning at high pH level than that at low pH level. 
Besides, the fraction of the ozone consumption attributed to rapid reaction, F, also 
increases with increasing pH value. The slow reaction rate shown in Figure 2 varies 
smoothly, but the value of K2 also increases with increasing pH. 
The formation concentration of hydroxyl radical at pH 7 and 9 is shown in Figure 
3. According to Figure 3, hydroxyl radical formation is more significant at pH 9 than 
 10
Further evidence of the effect of alkalinity on ozonation is illustrated in Figure 6, 
which presents the relationship between hydroxyl radical exposure and alkalinity 
reduction. In this study, the exposure represents the multiplication between reactant (?
OH) concentration and reaction time. The high exposure (10-3 mg/L × min) of 
hydroxyl radical leads to low alkalinity ratio, which is expressed by the empirical 
formula: 8786.00006.0 +−= XY (X: hydroxyl radical exposure; Y: 
alkalinity/alkalinity0) as shown in Figure 6. Based on the empirical formula, the 
hydroxyl radical exposure during the ozonation process could be easily interpreted by 
the reduction of alkalinity. 
 
O3/UV Process 
The photolysis of aqueous ozone (O3/UV process), called the advanced oxidation 
processes (AOPs) is commonly used in water and wastewater treatment plants. Figure 
7 shows the measured concentration of dissolved ozone and hydroxyl radical during 
the ozonation and O3/UV processes. The O3/UV process is operated at 30 Watts (UV 
light intensity). With increasing illumination time by UV light, the ozone 
concentration decreases rapidly and forms more hydroxyl radical in a batch reaction. 
The difference in hydroxyl radical formation between indirect ozone process and 
O3/UV process was clearly shown in Figure 3. The hydroxyl radical formation 
concentration in O3/UV process is about 0.02 mg/L at 1 minute reaction which is 
much higher than that at pH 9 (0.007 mg/L). Moreover, the order of hydroxyl radical 
formation concentration is ?OH (O3/UV)>?OH (pH 9)>?OH (pH 7), and the effect 
of alkalinity on hydroxyl radical formation is not significant once the pH value is held 
constant. Table 3 summaries the experimental data for the ozone, hydroxyl radical, 
and hydrogen peroxide concentration in the ozonation and O3/UV processes.

by-products formation potential (Rook, 1976). As shown in Figure 9, the difference of 
SUVA for the three model compounds is insignificant, because of their similar 
benzene structure, to which the attack of ozone following Crigee mechanism and the 
nonselective reactivity of hydroxyl radical result in having similar TOC and UV254 
removal. 
 
Formation of Ozonation by-Products 
According to a Glaze study (1986), the ozonation by-products include aliphatic 
aldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxide, and saturated carboxylic acid. Among 
them, aldehyde is the most concerned because of its harmful to human health. 
Aldehyde consists of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, and methyl glyoxal that 
are commonly found and investigated in ozonation process. Figure 10 shows the 
formation of the ozonation by-product (aldehyde) for resorcinol at different levels of 
pH and alkalinity treated by the ozonation and O3/UV processes. In this study, the 
principal aldehyde formation is formaldehyde, especially at high pH. For instance, at 
pH 9 the ratio of formaldehyde in aldehyde formation is up to 70 %, while at pH 7 is 
50 %, and pH 5 is 39 % in resorcinol. This formation suggests that hydroxyl radical 
(formed at pH 9) could destroy organic compound and generate shorter chain 
by-products such as formaldehyde than ozone molecule (formed at pH 5). In general, 
the order of the aldehyde formation concentration is O3 (pH 9) > O3 (pH 7) > O3 (pH 
5). Similar observations for phloroglucinol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were also 
found in this study. 
As shown in Figure 10, the addition of alkalinity would decrease the aldehyde 
concentration in the indirect ozone process. The phenomenon conforms to the 
above-mentioned findings, which states that alkalinity could reduce hydroxyl radical 
 14
and the inhibition of alkalinity would increase the chlorine consumption. The detailed 
experimental data are listed in Table 4. 
Chlorination of natural organic matter results in the formation of various 
chlorination disinfection by-products (DBP). Among all DBP, the THM and HAA are 
considered as the principal disinfection by-products which cause public health 
concerns for safe drinking water. The comparison of specific DBP formation 
potentials (DBPFP) and DBP yield coefficient (D) between the ozonation and O3/UV 
processes are also shown in Table 4. As mentioned earlier, the ozone and hydroxyl 
radical could change the properties in the three model compounds by destroying the 
aromatic structure, which leads to more reduction of chlorine demand and DBPFP. In 
the O3/UV process, the 40% TOC reduction performed by the hydroxyl radical would 
also enhance the reduction of DBPFP. Therefore, the reduction of DBPFP by the 
O3/UV process is much higher than that by the ozonation process. The relationship 
between DBP formation and chlorine demand could be evaluated by the DBP yield 
coefficient (D). Table 4 shows the values of D in different processes. The order of D 
is similar to the order of DBPFP as O3/UV system < < ozonation. 
 
Risk Assessment between Ozonation and O3/UV Process 
In this study, it was found that ozonation of organic precursors is successful in 
reducing the chlorination by products, especially at pH 5 for the ozonation and the 
O3/UV processes. However, it is noted that there are other DBPs such as aldehyde 
would be occurred in the course of ozonation. Therefore, it is required to have a 
further risk assessment to determine if the ozonation process is appropriate based on 
the carcinogenic DBPs concerns. The THMs, HAAs and aldehyde are considered 
 16
predict the ozone decomposition reaction more accurately than that by the first order 
model (Slawomir et al., 1999). 
The fluorescence method was introduced to analyze hydroxyl radical level in the 
indirect ozone process and O3/UV processes. It was observed that the amount of 
hydroxyl radical exposure in the O3/UV process was much higher than in the indirect 
ozone process. In the presence of alkalinity, the inhibition is significant and the linear 
correlation between alkalinity and hydroxyl radical exposure was revealed which 
might have insight into the effect of alkalinity on inhibition of hydroxyl radical. 
Consequently, more reduction of TOC and DBP in the O3/UV process would be 
observed.  
In ozonation, the chlorine demand increases with decreasing pH and increasing 
alkalinity. It is concluded that hydroxyl radical can more strongly destroy the organic 
precursors resulted in reducing chlorine consumption than ozone molecule. Moreover, 
the destruction of organic precursors by hydroxyl radical exhibits higher DBP 
formation potential than that by ozone molecule, and the inhibition of alkalinity in 
hydroxyl radical results in less DBP formation. In the ozonation process, the aldehyde 
concentration increases with increasing pH, which indicates that the hydroxyl radical 
increases both chlorination by-products and aldehyde formation. According to the risk 
assessment in ozonation process, water samples treated by the O3/UV and O3 (pH 5) 
process exhibit the lower risk. Therefore, both the ozonation and O3/UV processes 
with proper operation can reduce the organic precursors thereby providing the safe 
drinking water.
