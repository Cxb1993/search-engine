英文摘要 
This is a three-years project to perform channel 
backscattering experiment and find potential applications in 
nanoFETs. In the first year, the core of channel backscattering 
experiment to be established consists of the following key 
elements: (1) 1-D self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson quantum 
simulator such as to assess process parameters from C-V data, 
which in turn can quantify average thermal injection velocity at 
the beginning of the KBT layer, effective gate capacitance, and 
quasi-equilibrium threshold voltage; (2) subthreshold DIBL 
measurement to account for 2-D effect; (3) usage of 
ratio-and-shift method to measure source/drain series resistances 
and gate or channel length; (4) long-channel quasi-equilibrium 
mobility measurement in order to quantify mean-free-path for 
backscattering over the KBT layer; (5) I-V fitting to determine 
the width of the KBT layer; and finally (6) applying knowledge 
of probability and statistics, microscopic transport physics, 
solving of Poisson equation, and Monte Carlo simulation, in a 
systematical way to deal with and clarify the extracted KBT 
layer width, as well as underlying physical meanings and key 
process guidelines. Based on this experimental set-up, we 
proceed with the following: (1) application of channel 
backscattering experiment to bulk nanoFET test devices; (2) 
noise measurement on bulk nanoFETs along with correlation 
with channel backscattering data; and (3) establishment of bulk 
nanoFETs mesoscopic physics and understanding, 
characteristics analysis (via probability and statistics), compact 
model, key for devices manufacturing, and design guidelines.

五、 結論與討論 (ii) 
應變矽技術最近已被廣泛應用在奈米
CMOS 製程技術中。 主要有二種不同的方法
在製程中加入應力: (1) 在矽鍺基板上長出磊
晶矽原子層; 以及(2) 利用製程步驟本身及材
料性質差異製造應力，如：淺塹渠絕緣、覆蓋
層、矽化物或者矽鍺源汲極等。至目前為止，
針對機械應力的重要性有兩個主要的探討方
向。其一是晶圓在生產過程所感受的機械應力
會增強或減緩雜質的擴散，也因此影響最終掺
雜在元件之中分佈的情形。在做了上述這些製
程的改變後，檢驗應變矽元件表面特性及閘級
介電層的健全度是否受到影響是很重要的。另
一方面，機械應力也可改變元件的能帶結構，
因之改變了電晶體特性，諸如載子遷移率、熱
載子造成的可靠度問題、臨界電壓和閘極直接
穿隧電流等。憑仗這幾年的努力，我們已在應
變矽技術領域產出重要成果:

  能夠定量的推斷出元件結構內部的應力
大小及應力的種類(如：壓縮應力、伸張應力)
是必要的。目前已經有三種評估元件結構內部
應力的方法被提出：(1) 彎曲晶圓夾具，(2)精
密的應力模擬，及(3)拉曼光譜。但是利用電晶
體電性改變來推斷內部應力大小及種類的方
法仍未被提出過。然而，值得一提的是經由外
部施加應力造成的閘極直接穿隧電流改變已
經被深入的探討過了。另一方面，根據最近的
研究，形變位能係數已經可由實驗萃取而得，
並且和理論計算所預測的值一致。因此，在形
變位能係數已知的情況下，利用閘級穿隧電流
來反推元件內部應力大小已經變成一個可行
的方案。研究細節可參考我們發表的相關文獻:

A Parabolic Potential Barrier-Oriented Compact
Model for the kBT Layer’s Width in
Nano-MOSFETs
Ming-Jer Chen, Senior Member, IEEE, and Li-Fang Lu
Abstract—On the basis of a parabolic potential profile around
the source-channel junction barrier of nanoscale MOSFETs, a
new compact model is physically derived, which links the width
of thermal energy kBT layer (a critical zone in the context of
the backscattering theory) to the geometrical and bias parameters
of the devices. The proposed model is supported by experimen-
tal data and by a critical analysis of various simulation works
presented in the literature. The only fitting parameter remains
constant in a wide range of channel length (10–65 nm), gate
voltage (0.4–1.2 V), drain voltage (0.2–1.2 V), and temperature
(100 K–500 K). The confusing temperature-dependent issues in the
open literature are straightforwardly clarified.
Index Terms—Backscattering, MOSFET, nanometer.
I. INTRODUCTION
WHILE applied to electrically saturated nanoscaleMOSFETs, the channel backscattering theory [1], [2]
establishes a link between the thermal energy kBT layer, which
occupies a small fraction of the conductive channel near the
source, and the drive capability of the device. Thus, the ability
to quantitatively determine the width of this critical zone is
essential. To address the issue transparently, an analytically
compact treatment is desirable. One such model can be quoted
in the literature [3]
l ≈ L
(

)α
(1)
where l is the width of the kBT layer, and L is the metallurgical
channel length. However, so far, there has been some confusion
as to the magnitude of the temperature power exponent α. First
of all, fitting of the room-temperature I–V characteristics of
a simulation double-gate MOSFET has produced the apparent
α ≈ 0.57 [3]. Comparable α ≈ 0.5 has also been obtained
on experimental bulk n-MOSFETs in a temperature range of
233 K–298 K [4], [5]. In contrast, for the bulk case cover-
ing the same temperature range, a higher α ≈ 0.75 has been

experimentally determined [6]. Even α ≈ 1 has already been
adopted in a temperature-dependent backscattering-coefficient
extraction method [7]. This is also the case for the recent
double-gate device simulation [8], which has shown that l is
approximately proportional to the temperature from 100 K to
500 K. Obviously, these widespread values of the apparent α
must be clarified. On the other hand, a study on experimental
bulk n-MOSFETs has revealed that l significantly decreases
with increasing gate voltage [4], [6]; however, it is difficult for
(1) to elucidate due to the lack of the gate voltage. This hurdle
may be overcome by accurate modeling of the potential profile
in the channel [9]; however, a simple approach without loss of
accuracy is favored.
In this brief, the experimentally determined parabolic po-
tential profile in the previous work [4], [5] will be utilized to
approximate the source-channel junction barrier of nanoscale
MOSFETs in saturation. Then, a new compact model will be
physically derived for l with the channel length, gate overdrive,
drain voltage, and temperature as input parameters. The validity
and applicability of the resulting model will also be examined,
followed by a significant clarification on the aforementioned α
differences.
II. PARABOLIC BARRIER PICTURE
A parabolic potential profile near the source is schematically
shown in Fig. 1. Its extension to the remaining channel can be
described by
V (x) = VD(x/L˜)2. (2)
The origin x = 0 indicates the peak of the barrier. L˜ is the
apparent channel length corresponding to a certain position
where the parabolic potential drop from the top of the barrier
is equal to VD. Here, the barrier height with respect to the
source side is neglected due to the large drain voltages used. By
substituting x = l into (2) for a local potential drop of kBT/q
to constitute the thermal energy layer [1], [2], the following
expression can be obtained:
l = L˜
(
kBT
qVD
)0.5
. (3)
L˜ is expected to be a function of the channel length, gate and
drain voltage, and temperature. In other words, there exists a set

Fig. 2. Measured and calculated l versus gate voltage at two drain voltages of (a) 0.5 V and (b) 1.0 V for three temperatures and the corresponding L˜ versus
gate voltage for the drain voltages of (c) 0.5 V and (d) 1.0 V. The test device is a 55-nm bulk n-MOSFET. The calculation lines are from (3) and (4) with
η = 4.1 V−0.25.

The slope of the line yields η of 4.1 V−0.25.
insensitive to such a narrow temperature range. Consequently,
the resulting apparent temperature power exponent was limited
to 0.5, as reported in the previous work [4], [5]. Indeed, with
the known η as input, fairly good reproduction can be achieved,
as shown in Fig. 2, without adjusting any parameters. The same
interpretations also apply to the α ≈ 0.57 case [3]. Only the
room temperature of operation was involved, and therefore,
the temperature effect of L˜ can no longer be examined. In
other words, only in a wide temperature range (as done in the
comprehensive study of [8] and [10]) can the linear relationship
of l ∝ T , as shown in Fig. 3, be observed. Finally, from the
aspect of temperature dependences or the excellent coincidence
with a significant number of data, as shown in Fig. 3, the exist-
ing backscattering-coefficient extraction method [7] is valid.
IV. CONCLUSION
Based on a parabolic potential profile that is used to ap-
proximate the source-channel junction barrier of nanoscale
MOSFETs, a new compact model of the kBT layer’s width
has been physically derived along with the channel length, gate
overdrive, drain voltage, and temperature as input. The validity
of the parabolic potential barrier picture and the applicability
of the resulting compact model have been justified by exper-
imental data and by a critical analysis of various simulation
works presented in the literature. In particular, the confusing
temperature-dependent issues in the open literature have been
satisfactorily clarified.
Effect of uniaxial strain on anisotropic diffusion in silicon

A physical model is directly extended from the thermodynamic framework to deal with anisotropic
diffusion in uniaxially stressed silicon. With the anisotropy of the uniaxial strain induced activation
energy as input, two fundamental material parameters, the activation volume and the migration
strain anisotropy, can be quantitatively determined. When applied to boron, a process-device
coupled simulation is performed on a p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor
undergoing uniaxial stress in a manufacturing process. The resulting material parameters have been
found to be in satisfactory agreement with values presented in the literature. © 2006 American

Strain engineering has been widely recognized as an in-
dispensable performance booster in producing next-
generation metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
MOSFETs.1,2 There have been two fundamentally different
methods used to achieve this goal:1,2 i biaxially strained
silicon on a relaxed SiGe buffer layer and ii uniaxially
strained silicon through the use of trench isolation, silicide,
and cap layers during the manufacturing process. However,
diffusion in strained silicon is essentially different from that
of unstrained silicon. Thus, an understanding of strain depen-
dent diffusion, as well as its control, is a challenging issue.
So far, there have been significant studies in this direction
covering a wide range of experimental findings and
confirmations,3–9 atomistic calculations,10–13 physical
models,10–16 and technology computer-aided design.17 Spe-
cifically, Cowern et al.5 experimentally revealed a linear de-
pendence of the activation energy on strain. Within the ther-
modynamic framework constructed by Aziz et al. see Ref.
18, which is more recent and more thorough than the earlier
works cited above, the activation volume V˜  and the aniso-
tropy of the migration volume V˜ m−V˜
m exist in nature. The
combination of the activation energy, the activation volume,
and the anisotropy of the migration volume is remarkable, as
demonstrated in a physical model14–16,18 dedicated to both
the hydrostatic pressure experiment and the in-plane biaxial
stress experiment,

where Q33−biax is the biaxial strain induced activation energy
in the direction normal to the silicon surface, Ybiax is the
biaxial modulus,  is the lattice site volume, and Q11−biax is
the biaxial strain induced activation energy in the direction
parallel to the surface.
On the other hand, in the case of uniaxial stress as en-
countered while fabricating the MOSFET, without the use of
a relaxed SiGe buffer layer, the stress is created through the
trench isolation, silicide, or cap layers in a manufacturing
process. Therefore, a straightforward extension to the
uniaxial strain counterpart is essential. In this letter, one such
model is derived and its linkage to the case of biaxial strain,
Eqs. 1 and 2, is established. When applied to boron, a
process-device coupled simulation is performed on a p-type
MOSFET undergoing uniaxial stressing during the manufac-
turing process, followed by a systematic assessment of the
fundamental material parameters.
According to Aziz14 and Aziz et al.,18 in the case of
equilibrium or a quickly equilibrated point defect, the effect
of stress on the dopant diffusivity in the direction normal to
a 001 surface can be written as

m is the work required for the tran-
sition in the migration path, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and
T is the diffusion temperature. The tensor Vf involves the

Prior to determining the fundamental material param-
eters, a systematic treatment, such as that indicated in Fig. 2,
is demanded. In Fig. 2 a series of straight lines of Q11−uniax vs
Q33−uniax are from Eqs. 9 and 10 for a literature
range15,16,18 of V˜ and the migration strain anisotropy A˜
V˜ m−V˜
m /.18 In the calculation procedure, the follow-
ing literature values were employed:19 i C11=168 GPa and
C12=65 GPa, giving rise to Yuniax=131 GPa and =0.28; ii
=2.2610−23 cm3. The above experimental parameters
are also added to the figure. From the figure a set of V˜ and A˜
can be clearly located around the data point. On the other
hand, uncertainties exist based on a series of literature data:
V˜ =−0.16±0.05 .18 Taking such uncertainties into account,
Fig. 2 reveals that the data point does match the upper limit,
that is, V˜ =−0.21 . The corresponding V˜ m−V˜m in the vicin-
ity of 0.15  is determined accordingly, falling within the
reasonable range.15,16,18 Such corroborating experimental
evidence further indicates that the transient enhanced diffu-
sion effect is relatively insignificant when compared to the
long-term diffusion times in the underlying manufacturing
process. Under such circumstances, the point defect is rap-
idly equilibrated relative to the entire diffusion time.
Finally, we quoted the existing ab initio calculations:12,13
Q11−biax =−19.2 eV per unit strain and Q33−biax =−13.9 eV per
unit strain, which were transformed via the aforementioned
relationship into the equivalent Q11−uniax of −8.77 eV per unit
strain and Q33−uniax of −4.975 eV per unit strain. In this pro-
cess, the Ybiax used was equal to 183 GPa according to
Ybiax= C11+C12−C12 with its Poisson’s ratio =2C12/C11.
Evidently, the two data points are quite comparable to each
other, as displayed in Fig. 2.
A physical model dealing with anisotropic diffusion in
uniaxially stressed silicon is derived and is quantitatively
connected to the biaxial case. A process-device coupled
simulation is performed on a p-type MOSFET undergoing
uniaxial stress during the manufacturing process. A system-
atic treatment is conducted and the resulting fundamental
material parameters are in satisfactory agreement with litera-
ture values.

further reflections; and 2) at the end of the conductor (x = L),81
the positively directed carriers are absorbed without any ones82
injected. At the injection point x = 0, the ratio of the negatively83
directed flux to the positively directed flux yields the backscat-84
tering coefficient rc. In the previous work [12] on 80-nm silicon85
conductor of 1012 cm−3 doping with a linear potential profile,86
the simulation program SDemon has been validated in terms87
of the extracted mobility versus temperature that has been88
found to be comparable with the published silicon mobility data89
[13]. The same simulation works are executed here but with90
the following significant augmentations: a parabolic potential91
profile added; four different conductor lengths of 15, 25, 50,92
and 100 nm; and three different lattice temperatures of 150,93
200, and 300 K. According to the backscattering framework94
[2], [3], l can be explicitly expressed as a function of the95
conductor length L, the thermal energy kBT , and the applied96
voltage Va : l = LkBT/qVa for the linear potential profile and97
L
√
kBT/qVa for the parabolic one.98
III. RESULTS AND COMPARISONS99
On the longest conductor (L = 100 nm), the outcome of the100
simulation over 10−5 V ≤ Va ≤ 10−3 V furnishes the quan-101
tities of the near-equilibrium rc. Indeed, the rc of a linear102
potential profile is found to be close to that of the parabolic103
one, as expected. The corresponding λo is 56, 105, and 155 nm104
for 300, 200, and 150 K, respectively. Moreover, the extracted105
value of λo at room temperature is identical to that of the106
previous work [12].107
Unlike its near-equilibrium counterparts, the curvature of the108
potential profile for Va  kBT/q can play a relevant role in109
determining rc. First of all, in a linear potential profile, the110
simulated rc is shown in Fig. 1 for different temperatures versus111
applied voltage with the conductor length as a parameter. Also112
shown in the figure are the calculated results from (4) with113
known λo as input [9]114
rc =
1− exp (−Ll )
1 + η λ0l − exp
(−Ll ) (4)
where η is the potential profile dependent coefficient and equals115
unity in the linear potential profile. The primary reasons of116
using (4) rather than directly (2) are that it can adequately117
produce rc in the proximity of zero applied voltage while118
exactly reducing to (2) for Va  kBT/q or equivalently L l119
(see [9] for details). It can be seen that significant deviations are120
created with respect to the calculation results. In particular, this121
error increases with increasing applied voltage or decreasing122
conductor length. It is noteworthy that the lattice temperature123
does not significantly affect such trends. Indeed, the discrep-124
ancies in Fig. 1 can provide the opportunity to examine the125
mean-free-path issue. By substituting the simulated rc into the126
following [9]:127

the underlying λ1 can be extracted, as shown in Fig. 2 versus 128
the applied voltage. It can be seen that 1) λ1 falls below λo; 129
particularly at 1-V applied voltage, one can draw a specific 130
relation of λ1 = λo/γ with γ = 1.5 to 2.5; 2) on average, 131
λ1 decreases with decreasing conductor length; and 3) again on 132
average, λ1 decreases with the applied voltage. It is therefore 133

prevailing in the kBT layer (λ1 > l), the quasi-equilibrium148
conditions still govern the backscattered carriers.149
IV. EVIDENCE FOR CARRIER HEATING150
Here, we demonstrate that the different mean free paths be-151
tween the parabolic and linear potential profiles can be traced to152
the curvature of the potential profile, particularly the presence153
or absence of a zero or weak field regime near the injection154
point. For a parabolic potential profile, there is a significant155
fraction of the kBT layer, which can be identified as the156
zero-field regime. With this in mind, although the deviations157
from the lattice temperature would be possible as entering into158
the remainder (i.e., out of the zero-field regime), the overall car-159
rier heating in the kBT layer should be weakened. For a linear160
potential profile, however, such a zero-field regime is lacking.161
Therefore, once injected at the beginning of the kBT layer,162
the carriers immediately undergo acceleration from the nonzero163
field. Owing to the quasi-ballistic transport (less collision), the164
carrier temperature is expected to be higher than the lattice165
temperature, and the mean free path is therefore no longer166
independent of the carrier energy. The confirmative evidence167
is presented in terms of the carrier velocity component υx168

distribution in the transport direction near the injection point, 169
as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for L = 25 nm at Va = 0.8 V and 170
300 K and L = 50 nm at Va = 1.0 V and 150 K, respectively. 171
They are all created by the program DEMONs. These figures 172
clearly reveal two significant differences between the potential 173
profiles. First, in a parabolic potential profile, a single hemi- 174
Maxwellian distribution is retained in the positively directed 175
carriers but is split into two distinct components in the linear 176
potential case: One of the longitudinal effective masses and one 177
of the transverse effective masses. This strongly points to the 178
effect of the nonzero field in the linear potential profile. Second, 179
the distribution of the negatively directed or backscattered 180
carriers appears to be wider in a linear potential profile than 181
the parabolic one. 182

Abstract --- The flux aspect in terms of the channel 
backscattering has emerged as a promising tool to 
examine the transport phenomena and performance 
limits in nanoFETs, both theoretically and 
experimentally. In this paper, the historical overview 
of the channel backscattering framework is given. 
Then, the recent studies in this direction are 
highlighted, followed by several challenging issues. It 
is further suggested that the device researchers 
worldwide collaborate together in an effort to 
improve the device physics in the context of the 
channel backscattering. The ultimate aim is to render 
the channel backscattering framework practically 
suitable for the nanoFET structures, both 1-D and 
2-D, with the feature size down to 10 nm and beyond. 
Keywords: Nano, MOSFETs, Transport, Scattering 
 
I. Introduction 
The conventional device physics knowledge as 
drawn from a well-known drift/diffusion picture has 
recently encountered the difficulty in elucidating 
nanoFETs transport, especially in the saturation 
regime of operation. To overcome this obstacle, the 
flux aspect of channel backscattering has been 
alternatively introduced [1],[2]. The main merits of 
this new picture are that (i) it can provide a clear 
understanding of the underlying device physics, on 
the basis of a small fraction of the channel near the 
quasi-equilibrium source, rather than the traditional 
high-field one near the drain; (ii) it can meet the 
computationally efficient requirements; and (iii) it 
can furnish information about how close to the 
thermal limit the device performance can achieve.  
In this paper, the historical overview of the 
channel backscattering framework is presented. Then, 
the recent research trends are highlighted. The 
challenging issues are subsequently addressed. 
Finally, several key directions are suggested for the 
years ahead. The ultimate aim is to make the channel 
backscattering practically suitable for the next 
generation of device physics, valid for 1-D and 2-D 
nanoFETs down to 10-nm feature size and beyond. 
 
II. Channel Backscattering: Historical Overview 
(Maxwellian-Boltzmann Statistics) 
Understanding of the electrical properties of a 
near-equilibrium bulk conductor can be made clear 
from the backscattering point of view [3]. The 
backscattering events in the conductor have been 
systematically treated by Datta [3], leading to a 
functional expression for rc, the well-known 
backscattering coefficient at the injection point: 
.
o
c L
Lr λ+=                        (1) 
Here L is the length of the conductor and λo is the 
equilibrium mean-free-path for backscattering. Once 
rc is known, the total conductance can be determined 
accordingly.  Even in the case of quasi-ballistic 
transport (i.e., λo > L), (1) remains valid [3]. 
Essentially, Eq. (1) can apply to the channel 
backscattering in MOSFETs under near-equilibrium 
conditions [1],[2]. In Lundstrom’s view [1] (see Fig. 
1), extension to the saturation regime of operation 
can be done by simply replacing the conductor’s 
length L in (1) with the width designated l of a 
localized quasi-equilibrium zone near the source, 
over which the potential drops by kBT/q. The 
resulting expression reads as  
o
c l
lr λ+=  .                     (2)             
Within the context of the channel backscattering 
[1],[2], λo is the only mean-free-path for all operating 
conditions. One of the merits of the channel 
backscattering picture is that it is concentrated solely 
on a local zone near the quasi-equilibrium source, 
rather than conventionally the high-field region near 
the drain where the carrier heating and scattering are 
extremely difficult to analyze. Once rc is known, then 
the saturation and linear drain current per unit width 
can be calculated [1],[2]:

where Qinv is the inversion layer charge per unit area 
and vinj is the positively-directed average thermal 
injection velocity, both defined at the peak of the 
source-channel barrier or the virtual source. Qinv 
appropriately follows the MOS electrostatics: Qinv = 
Ceff(VG − Vth), where Ceff is the inversion gate 
dependent rc extraction method, to experimentally 
assess the power exponents of concern. The results 
are that for VG increasing from 0.3 V to 1.2 V, βl 
decreases from 1.0 to 0.75, βvinj from 0.45 to 0.25, 
and βμ from 0.45 to around -1.5. The corresponding 
inversion charge coefficient ρQ is about 0.4×10-3/oK. 
Evidently, the initially introduced power exponents 
are fairly reasonable [5]. 
     However, serious questions on the precision of 
the temperature dependent rc extraction method have 
recently arisen. By means of sophisticated Monte 
Carlo simulations on the double-gate MOSFETs, Zilli, 
et al. [10] have exhibited the influence of the 
inversion charge coefficient ρQ on the precision of the 
temperature method. The plausible origins are the 
uncertainties encountered in estimating the inversion 
charge coefficient ρQ. However, the experimental 
values of ρQ of about 0.4×10-3/oK in [5],[9] is less 
than those (∼10-3/oK) of the Monte Carlo simulations 
[10]. Nevertheless, further study is needed to resolve 
this contradicting issue. 
 
B. On the Functional Expression of λo = 2μkBT/qvinj 
A Monte Carlo particle simulation program 
dedicated to the solving of the complicated scattering 
events (i.e., acoustic phonon scattering, optical 
phonon scattering, and ionized impurity scattering) in 
a silicon bulk conductor has been developed 
elsewhere [11]. This program named SDemon 
(currently merged into a new one called DEMONs 
[11]) can provide the rich information concerning the 
carrier positively-directed and negatively-directed 
velocity distributions in the transport direction. The 
boundary conditions used are that (i) at the origin x = 
0, the hemi-Maxwellian carriers are injected while, in 
the steady state, absorbing the backscattered carriers 
without further reflections; and (ii) at the end of the 
conductor (x = L) the positively-directed carriers are 
absorbed without any ones injected. At the injection 
point x = 0, the ratio of the negatively-directed flux to 
the positively-directed flux yields the backscattering 
coefficient rc. In the work of Chen, et al. [12] on 
80-nm silicon conductor with a linear potential 
profile, the extracted mobility versus temperature has 
been found to be comparable with the literature 
silicon mobility data. This therefore confirms the 
validity of the relationship of λo = 2μkBT/qvinj, the 
non-degenerate case. The degenerate situation is 
addressed in the next section. 
 
C. On the Mean-Free-Path for Backscattering 
(1) Non-degenerate Statistics 
Within the context of the channel backscattering 
[1],[2], the Boltzmann λo is the only mean-free-path 
for all operating conditions. More recently, however, 
sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation studies have 
pointed to the significance of the carrier heating in 
kBT layer or in general the non-equilibrium transport 
over the channel. In the work of Palestri, et al. 
[13],[14], the carrier heating factor has been 
incorporated [14] by replacing λo in (2) with the 
apparent mean-free-path λ1, thus constituting a new 
expression: 
1λ+= l
lrc  .                        (7) 
Particularly, in case of non-degenerate statistics, the 
Monte Carlo simulations [14] at room temperature on 
a linear channel potential profile have exhibited a 
certain relationship: λ1 =λo/γ with γ = 1.5 to 2.0, 
different at all from that (λ1 = λo) in the literature 
[1],[2]. This means that the backscattered flux is not 
Maxwellian but with much higher energy than the 
lattice temperature. Equivalently, the actual 
characteristic length over which backscattering 
affects rc is longer than l and hence in the context of 
the channel backscattering this change is reflected in 
the change of the mean-free-path for backscattering 
[13],[14]. 
To clarify above arguments, Chen, et al. [15] 
have performed Monte Carlo simulations [11] on a 
silicon bulk conductor aimed at re-examining the 
channel backscattering in bulk nano-MOSFETs (see 
Fig. 13 to 17). Here, the potential profile used is not 
self-consistent but frozen, which allows a direct 
examination of the mean-free-path issue. The main 
results achieved in this study can be summarized 
below: 
(i) The near-equilibrium mean-free-path for 
backscattering, λo, is independent of the 
potential profile. 
(ii) The apparent mean-free-path, λ1, in a 
localized quasi-ballistic kBT layer can be 
linked with the curvature of the potential 
profile. 
(iii) λ1 in a linear potential profile is lower than λo 
due to the presence of the carrier heating, as 
highlighted by the carrier velocity distribution 
near the injection point.  
(iv) In a parabolic potential profile, the 
mean-free-paths remain consistent: λ1 = λo. 
This means that despite the quasi-ballistic 
transport prevailing in the kBT layer (λ1 > l), 
the quasi-equilibrium conditions still govern 
the backscattered carriers. 
 
(2) Degenerate Statistics 
    Palestri, et al. [14] have further examined the 
effects of the carrier degeneracy in an inversion layer. 
Their conclusive remarks can be summarized as 
follows: 
(i) Degeneracy can increase the Fermi-Dirac vinj 
relative to the Maxwellian-Boltzmann vinj. 
(ii) Degeneracy can also increase the Fermi-Dirac 
λo relative to the Maxwellian-Boltzmann λo. 
(iii) Degeneracy slightly increases rc, relative to a 
significant improvement in the injection 
velocity. 
temperature would be possible as entering into the 
remainder (that is, out of the zero-field regime), the 
overall carrier heating in the kBT layer should be 
weakened. For a linear potential profile, however, 
such a zero-field regime is lacking. Therefore, once 
injected at the beginning of the kBT layer, the carriers 
immediately undergo acceleration from the non-zero 
field. Owing to the quasi-ballistic transport (less 
collision), the carrier temperature is expected to be 
higher than the lattice temperature and the 
mean-free-path is therefore no longer independent of 
the carrier energy. The confirmative evidence is 
presented in terms of the carrier velocity component 
υx distribution in the transport direction near the 
injection point (see Fig. 16 and 17). They were all 
created by the program DEMONs. For a parabolic 
potential profile a single hemi-Maxwellian 
distribution is retained in the positively-directed 
carriers but is split into two distinct components in 
the linear potential case: One of the longitudinal 
effective mass and one of the transverse effective 
mass.  This strongly points to the effect of the 
non-zero field in the linear potential profile.  
Through the Monte Carlo simulation with the 
degeneracy effects neglected, Jungemann, et al. [24] 
have observed that (i) the positively-directed 
injection velocity at the peak of the source-channel 
barrier increases due to non-equilibrium effects; and 
(ii) the backscattered velocity is reduced thus 
increasing the drift velocity even further. This effect 
is stronger in strained silicon, where the backward 
velocity is almost the same as for unstrained Si, while 
the injection velocity is much higher.  
     Fischetti, et al. [25] have emphasized the 
significance of the so-called “source starvation”: the 
inability of the source region to sustain a large flow 
of carriers in longitudinal velocity states in the 
channel, unless the momentum relaxation rate and/or 
the doping density in the source are sufficiently large. 
Their simulation results have pointed to the fact that 
it can be erroneous to assume an equilibrium carrier 
distribution, not only near the source-channel 
junction or in the channel, but also a few 
diffusion-lengths inside the heavily-doped source 
region. Within or near the ballistic regime, electrons 
are carried away so efficiently along the channel that 
the source region becomes “starved” of carriers 
populating longitudinal k states. Unless the 
momentum relaxation time in the source becomes 
sufficiently short, there will not be enough carriers 
which can be injected into the channel and contribute 
to the drain current. A higher doping in the source 
supplies more carriers which can be scattered and 
redirected into longitudinal k states.  It also reduces 
the momentum relaxation time, as there are more 
impurities to which electrons can transfer momentum 
[25].  
 
B. Carrier Degeneracy 
In bulk nano-MOSFETs, the underlying carrier 
degeneracy is quite weak, as reflected by an existing 
low value (≈1.3 for a 1-V gate voltage as cited from 
Ref. [9]) of the Fermi-Dirac injection velocity to 
Maxwellian injection velocity ratio. However, for the 
case of the ultra-thin film counterparts, the carrier 
degeneracy is pronounced due to the space 
confinement effect [14].  
 
C. Drain Scattering and Coulomb Scattering 
Well recognized backscattering theory of 
MOSFETs [1],[2] argues that a key zone located near 
the thermal equilibrium reservoir source can critically 
determine the device’s performance. This statement 
remains valid as long as the backscattered carriers 
from the remainder of the channel are energetically 
insignificant with respect to the peak of the 
source-channel barrier. For ultra-short devices with 
ballistic transport across the channel, however, the 
backscattering events in the drain, through the 
feedback to the source, may ultimately dominate, as 
revealed by the Monte Carlo particle simulations 
[26],[27].  
Khakifirooz and Antoniadis [22] have 
experimentally shown that the virtual source electron 
velocity or equivalently the ballistic fraction B 
increases with channel length shrinking but tends to 
saturate as the channel length is reduced below a 
certain critical length of 40 to 60 nm. They have 
attributed such a saturation trend to the halo implant 
pocket induced Coulomb scattering. Alternative 
interpretations have been suggested by Fischetti, et al. 
[28]: Long-range electron-electron interactions. Such 
Coulomb scattering encountered by electrons in the 
channel may stem from those in the source, the drain, 
and even the gate [28].  
D. Nanowires 
Tian, et al. [29] have successfully fabricated 
silicon nanowire transistors with 10-nm diameter. 
They have also measured corresponding channel 
backscattering characteristics for the first time. 
 
VI. Conclusion 
   The historical overview of the channel 
backscattering framework has been presented. Both 
the recent studies and the challenging issues have 
been addressed. To improve the existing channel 
backscattering framework, several key directions are 
suggested in the following:  
z The effects of non-equilibrium conditions, 
such as the source starvation, the velocity 
overshoot near the drain, and the carrier 
heating in the source; 
z The effects of carrier degeneracy; 
z The temperature dependent method clarified; 
z The effects of long-range Coulomb scattering; 
z Significant extension to 1-D nanoFETs case.
