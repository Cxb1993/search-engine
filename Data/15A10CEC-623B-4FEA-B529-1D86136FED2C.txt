Abstract: 
In this project, we study the cooperative communication techniques in the code 
division multiple access (CDMA) uplink systems. In practical, it is difficult to achieve 
synchronization in a cooperative network with multiple source users and multiple relay 
nodes. The synchronization among all source-relay links is especially prohibitive 
because the transmission delays between multiple source users and each relay node are 
different. With this regard, we investigate the cooperative CDMA networks where S-R 
links are asynchronous while other links can achieve synchronous requirement with 
accurate location information. We proposed the optimization of precoding filters at 
relay nodes and decoing filter at the destination to combat the multiple access 
interference (MAI) and inter-symbol-interference (ISI) in asynchronous uplink system. 
From the computer simulations, it shows that the proposed RAD-MUD scheme 
combined with variant cooperative strategies outperforms other schemes in the 
asynchronous CDMA uplink systems.

interference, but controls the residual noise and interference to a certain degree. The detection 
performance of the decision feedback detector can be improved with the feedback of correct 
decisions, but may suffer from error propagation with error decisions at low signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR). In the research, we plan to adopt a finite-length MMSE MUD to eliminate MAI 
and ISI with reasonable computational complexity. The resulting signal-to-interference plus 
noise ratio (SINR) of users’ symbols at each relay node will be further exploited in our 
relaying strategies to enhance the overall system performance. Recently, user cooperation in 
asynchronous CDMA uplink has been studied in [10-11]. In these work, the authors analyzed 
the outage performance of the asynchronous multiuser systems and examined loss of spectral 
efficiency due to non-orthogonal transmissions and asynchronism. However, the signal 
processing strategies at relays and practical multiuser detection methods in the asynchronous 
CDMA uplink system have not been addressed in [4-5]. 
 
三. 問題敘述和解決辦法 
System Model 
Consider a cooperative network where users cooperate by relaying each other’s message. As 
illustrated in Fig.1, there are K source users, denoted by S = {S1,…, SK}, and L cooperating 
users, denoted by R = {R1,… ,RL}, which serve as relay nodes at a time instance. The 
cooperative transmission takes two phases. In the first phase, each source node, say node kS , 
transmits M data symbols xk[m], m=1,…,M, using dedicated spreading waveforms with 
transmission power SP . The signal transmitted by the source node can be expressed by

where each data symbol ][mxk  אM  is identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) with 
unit power and M is the signal constellation to modulate the data. Let N be the spreading gain, 
the spreading waveforms assigned to source node Sk can be expressed as

 In the project, we assume that the transmission from all relays to the destination and the 
transmissions from all relay nodes to the destination are well synchronized with accurate location

given by

where 
kS D
h is  the coefficient of the fading channel from source kS  to the destination, and 
,1( )Dv t  is the AWGN with zero-mean and variance

vσ . After the destination, the received 
signal ,1( )Dy t  is then passed through a MFB corresponding to all spreading waveforms. During 
the m-th symbol period, the output of the MFB at the destination is given by 
,1 ,1[ ] [ ] [ ],D SD Dm m m= +y RH x v  
where SDH = diag 1( ,..., ),KS S D S S DP h P h  R is the correlation matrix of the synchronous

Gaussian noise vector with distribution 2( , )vCN σ0 R . 
 
In the second phase, the MFB outputs at Rl, i.e., lY = [ [1]ly , [2]ly ,…, [ ]l My ] is precoded as a 
K×M matrix lT = [ [1]lt , [2]lt ,…, [ ]l Mt ], where [ ]l Mt =[ ][1, mtl ,…, ][, mt Kl
T] . The precoding 
procedure will be described in the following section. The precoded symbols [ ]l Mt  are 
re-transmitted by the relay Rl using the set of spreading waveforms { )(1 ts ,…, )(tsK } during the 
m-th symbol period. More specifically, the signal transmitted by node Rl in the second phase is 
given by 
 Fig. 2 The block diagram of RAD-MUD with zero-forcing precoding at relays. 
 
To leverage the spatial diversity in multiuser networks, the estimate of symbols with smaller 
residual interference plus noise shall be enhanced, while the estimate of symbols with larger 
residual interference plus noise should be suppressed. With the residual SINR and the CSI of 
R-D links, mapping functions {g1(·), g2(·), · · · , gL(·)} are determined by the cooperative 
strategy employed at relays, e.g. transmit beamforming, selective relaying and distributed 
space time coding, which will be described in the next section. 
In the scheme, one half of decorrelating operations is performed at relays by multiplying 
gl(Zl) with L−H at the last stage of the precoder, where L is the Cholesky factorization of R 
subject to R = LLH. Thus, the symbols re-transmitted by the l-th relay Tl = [tl[1], tl[2], · · · , 
tl[M]] is given by

MMSE Multiuser Detection at Destination 
It is assumed that the precoding strategy at relays and all channel coefficients and the 
correlation matrix among spreading waveforms are known at the destination. We use the 
MMSE linear estimator to detect data symbols at the destination. Suppose that gl(Zl) =WlZl 
(e.g. in the case of beamforming and selective relaying), where Wl = diag(wl,1, · · · ,wl,K) is a 
diagonal weighting matrix whose elements are determined by the transmission strategy 
subject to the total power constraint. After prewhitening, the signal received at the destination 
can be written as

to meet the power constraint. 
2. Selective Relaying: 
In only the channel gain is available yet without phase-coherent transmission, we may use 
the selective relaying strategy. That is, only one relay is selected to serve a specific source 
node. For source Sk, a relay is selected if it can attain the maximal SINR subject to the 
transmit power constraint. Thus, for each source Sk

3. Distributed Spate-Time Coding (DSTC): 
If there is no channel information available at relays, we can simply employ DSTC to 
achieve the spatial diversity . Here, we consider space-time linear block codes with block 
length M, which has to be greater than L to attain full diversity. Let Al is an M ×M unitary 
space time coding matrix randomly generated at relays. When DSTC is applied, gl(Zl) = 
WlZlAl, where Wl is a diagonal weighting matrix. Then, the transmitted symbols at Rl are 
given by 
the multiuser uplink system even with asynchronous S-R links. Besides, RAD-MUD is better 
than the other two precoding schemes by 2.5-3 dB since MAI caused by the transmission over 
R-D links is eliminated without transmit power expansion or receive noise amplification. 
 
Figure 3: The BER performance comparison for the system using equally weighing factors. 
 
With cooperative strategies, the advantage of RAD-MUD over the other precoding schemes is 
more pronounced since MAI can be greatly reduced by RAD-MUD. We compare the BER 
performances of three schemes with transmit beamforming in Fig.4. With global CSI, the BER 
performance with multiuser cooperation is greatly improved. Among the tree schemes, 
zero-forcing precoding performs the worse at low SNR because of power expansion at the 
transmitter. At high SNR, MAI caused by non-orthogonal transmission of R-D links is 
coheretly combined at the destination, which dominates the performance of cooperative 
MMSE-MUD scheme. With transmit beamforming, RAD-MUD outperforms the other two 
schemes by 8-10 dB at BER= 10−5. 
matrix realizations. We employ the linear MMSE estimator of fixed length NCl = 7 at relays. 
We adopt the equal weight for DTSC. In all schemes, the suboptimal ML detection scheme is 
employed at the destination. For cooperative MMSE-MUD, the MFB output is first multiplied 
by a one-tap matrix MMSE equalizer before sub-optimal ML detection. The proposed RAD- 
MUD outperforms other two schemes by 2-4 dB. As compared with RAD-MUD with equal 
weights in Fig.3, DSTC has 15 dB performance gain at BER = 0.005 without requiring further 
channel information at relays. 
 
Figure 6: The BER performance comparison for the system using DSTC. 
 
五. 計畫成果自評 
In the project, the use of RAD-MUD in association with user cooperation was investigated 
in the cooperative uplink network under a more practical assumption, i.e. transmissions from 
all source nodes to each relay are asynchronous. At relay nodes, the amplify-and-forward 
relaying scheme is used to avoid detection errors caused by MAI and ISI. It is observed from 
computer simulation that the use of RAD-MUD is advantageous in mitigating MAI even 
without any cooperative strategy applied. With cooperative strategies, such as transmit 
beamforming, selective relaying and DSTC, the performance gain of RAD-MUD is much 
more obvious. This demonstrates that RAD-MUD can exploit the multiuser diversity in a 
cooperative CDMA uplink system under the practical asynchronous assumption.
