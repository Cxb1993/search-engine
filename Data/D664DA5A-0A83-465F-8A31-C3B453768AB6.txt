Abstract 
The formation of paired helical filaments arising from the short hexapeptide in the third repeat of tau protein, 
306VQIVYK311, is critical for tau polymerization. The atomic structure of the VQIVYK oligomer has revealed 
a dry, tightly self-complementing structure between the neighboring β-sheet layers, termed as “steric zipper”. 
In this study, several molecular dynamics simulations with all-atom explicit water were conducted to 
investigate the structural stability and aggregation behavior of the VQIVYK peptide with various sizes and its 
single alanine replacement mutations. Our results indicate that the van der Waals interaction between side 
chains of Q2, the π-π stacking interaction between aromatic rings of Y5, and the electrostatic interaction 
between K6 and the C terminus play an important role in stabilizing the VQIVYK oligomers within the same 
β-sheet layer; while hydrophobic steric zipper involved V1, I3 and Y5 is responsible for holding the 
neighboring β-sheet layers together. The twisted angles of the VQIVYK oligomers were also analyzed and 
shown to be sizes-dependent. The present results not only provide atomic insights into amyloid formation, but 
are also helpful for designing new or modified capping peptides and inhibitors to prevent fibril formation of 
the VQIVYK peptide from tau protein.  
Keywords: VQIVYK peptide, tau protein, steric zipper, molecular dynamics simulations, π-π stacking

1. Introduction 
The senile plaques (SPs) or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), formed by fibrous assemblies of the Aβ 
peptide or tau protein, have become characteristic hallmarks of a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) after the patient’s death [1]. These insoluble aggregates are thought to be toxic to neurons either by 
causing toxic signaling defect or by obstructing the cell interior. The precipitation of NFTs in the cytoplasm is 
attributed to the fact that the ordered cytoskeleton consisting of microtubules, tau, and intermediate filaments 
is destroyed. The major constituents of NFTs are paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments (SFs) 
[2]. The hyperphosphorylated tau, the major component for insoluble PHFs, has been proposed to play an 
important role in dissociating tau and tubulin [3-5]. 
Tau protein is one of the neuronal microtubule-associated proteins and contributes to stabilize an axonal 
microtubule. Although it exhibits an unfolded flexible structure dominated by a random-coil conformation in 
aqueous solution [6-8], tau undergoes a structural transition from unfolded structures to well-defined fibers, 
the PHFs [9]. The core of tau aggregation is mainly involved in the microtubule-binding domain (MBD), 
which is composed of three or four repeats of 31 or 32 amino acids [10]. MBD also exhibits seeding effects on 
PHF assembly in vitro [11,12]. It has been hypothesized that the formation of β-sheet structure arising from 
the short hexapeptide in the second and third repeats of tau, 275VQIINK280 (PHF6* in R2) and 306VQIVYK311 
(PHF6 in R3) [13-16], is critical for tau polymerization. It has also been speculated that the interaction 
between these two regions gives rise to the unique PHF morphology [13,14]. Recent experimental results have 
indicated that the tripeptide VYK is minimally sufficient for fibril formation and that mixing VYK with PHF6 
can form PHF-like twisted filaments [17]. However, the initial oligomerization process of the full-length tau 
protein or the peptide fragments still remains unclear so far.  
It is believed that the proteins/peptides fibril formation and deposition share common pathogenic 
mechanisms. Experimental evidences have led to the commonly accepted notion that a cross-β-spine 
 6
VQIVYK oligmer atoms. Subsequently, the VQIVYK oligmers alone was minimized with 5,000 steps, 
followed by the minimization of the entire system for additional 5,000 iterations. The system was 
energy-minimized with the method described above until the maximum derivative was lower than 0.001 
kcalmol-1Å-1. Finally, 20-ns MD simulation for each model was carried out with constant temperature 
constraint at 330 K. This simulation temperature is slightly higher than room temperature to avoid kinetic 
traps and allow us to probe the stabilities and dynamics of the VQIVYK oligomers more quickly in the 
limited simulation time scale. The time step for integration was 2 fs using the RATTLE algorithm to constrain 
the bonds connecting hydrogen atoms during simulation [40]. Cut-off radius of 12 Å for both nonbonded 
electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was employed. The trajectories were saved every 1 ps for further 
structural analyses using Analysis and Measure module of the InsightII program.  
2.3 Structural analyses 
The interstrand distance (dstrand) was calculated by averaging pairwise residue Cα-Cα distances of V1-V1, 
Q2-Q2, I3-I3, V4-V4, Y5-Y5, and K6-K6 within the same β-sheet layer. [34]. A side-chain contact was 
assigned when the distance between the centers of the mass (COM) of two adjacent side chains was less than 
6.7 Å [41]. Two charged groups were considered to interact when the distance between their interaction 
centers, i.e. the carbon atom of the C terminus or the charged nitrogen atom of Lys, was 4.5 Å or less [42,43]. 
The aromatic-aromatic interaction was counted when the distance between two ring centroids (d) was less 
than 7.5 Å [44]. To further analyze the various geometric orientations of the aromatic-aromatic interactions, 
the other two parameters (P and θ) were calculated as shown in Figure 2. In addition, to evaluate the structural 
compactness of the hydrophobic steric zipper involved V1, I3 and Y5, the radius of gyration (Rg) of their side 
chains was calculated using the Insight II program. The difference of Rg was defined as △Rg = Rgi - Rg0, 
where Rgi and Rg0 are the Rg of the hydrophobic side chains of V1, I3 and Y5 during the simulation and in the 
crystal structure, respectively. The twisted angle was defined as the angle between the vector Cα(Q2)-Cα(Y5) 
and vector Cα(Q2)-Cα(Y5) of two adjacent β-strands within the same β-sheet layer. 
 
3. Results and discussion: 
3.1 The relative structural stability of the VQIVYK oligomers with different size 
3.1.1 One-sheet models 
The time series of the interstrand distance (dstrand) of the VQIVYK oligomers with various sizes were 
plotted in Figure 3 to indicate their relative stabilities. As shown in Figure 3(a), the dstrand of the SH1-ST2 
model increased sharply at 5 ns and reached to the value of 12 Å after 7.5 ns, indicating that the SH1-ST2 
model lost most of its structural integrity during the simulation. Similarly, the dstrand of the SH1-ST3 model 
increased sharply at 5 ns and reached to equilibrium value of nearly 10 Å, suggesting that the SH1-ST3 model 
partially lost its structural organization to a less extent than the SH1-ST2 model. In contrast, the SH1-SH5 
model maintained its structural integrity well with remarkably low values of dstrand. For SH1-ST4, the 
magnitudes of the dstrand fluctuations are between those of the SH1-ST2 and SH1-ST5 models. These results 
indicate that the structural stability of the VQIVYK oligomers increases with increasing the numbers of 
β-strands for the one-sheet models, which is consistent with the previous MD study of the human 
calcitonin-derived peptide DFNKF (hCT15-19), showing that the stability of the DFNKF oligomers increases 
with their sizes [34]. Theoretical studies of the amyloidogenic peptide GNNQQNY [45] and the GGVVIA 
peptide [39] also suggested that the stability of these oligomers increases with increasing the number of 
 8
conserved for both one- and two-sheet models, which can be attributed to the π-π stacking interactions 
between the aromatic rings of Y5. To further explore the role of the π-π-stacking interactions between Y5 on 
the structural stability of the VQIVYK oligomers, the distribution of the dCOM between the Y5 aromatic rings 
was calculated and the results are shown in Figure 5(a). It is observed that the highest peak of the distribution 
is around 5-6 Å, which is consistent with the previous statistic study, showing that the centroid-centroid 
separation of aromatic side-chain pairs exhibit relative high peak at 5-6 Å. Our results show that the π-π 
stacking interactions between the Y5 aromatic rings are well preserved during most of the simulation courses 
for both one- and two-sheet models. It is of interest to further investigate the π-π stacking arrangements 
between the Y5 aromatic rings of the VQIVYK oligomers. The relative spatial orientations of the interacting 
aromatic rings were characterized on the basis of the two parameters (P and θ), as described in Bhattacharyya 
et al. [47]. Various types of aromatic-aromatic interactions were classified in accordance with different 
combinations of P and θ (Figure 2(b)) and the results are presented in Figure 6. It is obvious that the Y5 
aromatic rings do not adopt the face-to-face π-π stacking arrangement as observed in the crystal structures 
(Figure 1). Instead, the preferred orientations are offset-to-edge (o-e), offset-to-tilt (o-t), edge-to-face (e-f), 
and edge-to-tilt (e-t). It can be attributed to the twisted β-strand organization, which optimizes the π-π 
stacking of the Y5 aromatic rings between the adjacent β-strands, resulting in the disappearance of the 
face-to-face π-π stacking arrangement.  
3.2.3 The electrostatic interaction between Lys6 and C terminus 
Similar to Y5-Y5 pair, the averaged pairwise Cα-Cα distance for K6-K6 is also conserved at 9.5 Å for 
both one- and two-sheet models (Figure 3(b)). Previous MD study of the amyloid fibril formation for the 
DFNKF peptide from human calcitonin hormone has indicated that the electrostatic interactions between Lys 
and the C terminus and between Asp and the N terminus are the most important interactions contributing to 
the stability of the DFNKF organization [34,35,48]. Similar electrostatic interaction between K6 and the C 
terminus was also found for the VQIVYK oligomers. The distributions of the distances between the charged 
nitrogen atom of K6 side chain and the carbon atom of the C terminus were computed and the results are 
shown in Figure 5(b). It exhibits a narrow peak around 3.5-4.5 Å, suggesting that the electrostatic interactions 
between K6 and C terminus are almost preserved during the entire simulations course, leading to associating 
the adjacent β-strands. 
3.2.4 Y5 and K6 play critical role in initiating VQIVYK aggregation 
Figure 7(a) and 7(b) show the snapshots of the SH1-ST2 and SH1-ST3 models at 20 ns, respectively, 
which mimic the early stage of VQIVYK aggregation. These structures show that the π-π stacking 
interactions between the Y5 aromatic rings and the electrostatic interactions between K6 and C-terminus are 
well preserved, indicating that these interactions play a critical role in initiating the aggregation of the 
VQIVYK peptide. In contrast, the van der Waals interaction of Q2 is not strong enough to associate the 
β-strands, resulting in the N-terminal dissociation of the VQIVYK peptide. Taken together, our results 
strongly suggest that Y5 and K6 may participate in the core nucleation site at the early stage of VQIVYK 
aggregation. Our results are supported by the previous experimental observations where the tripeptide VYK 
acts as the core nucleation site for the formation of amyloid fibrils displaying the PHF morphology 
characteristic of neurofibrillary tangles [17]. Nevertheless, the van der Waals interactions of Q2 can be further 
enhanced with increasing the oligomeric sizes and thus contributes positively to the entire oligomeric 
structures of higher-order oligomers, such as the SH2-ST4 and SH2-ST5 models (Figure 7(c)).

structural organization of the steric zipper, resulting in an unstable oligomeric organization. Previous MD 
study of the GNNQQNY peptide also reported that the residue substitutions at the sheet-sheet interface would 
cause larger destabilization than those oriented toward the peptide-water interface [45]. To further investigate 
the mutant effects of V1A, I3A and Y5A, the contour maps between the dstrand and the native intersheet 
hydrophobic contacts are presented in Figure 11. It is clear that the collapses of the hydrophobic interactions 
between the two β-sheet layers are associated with the disassociation of the adjacent β-strands, leading to the 
destruction of the entire oligomeric structures.  
Among these mutants, Y5A exhibits the highest ability to destabilize the structural organization due to 
the lack of the π-π stacking interaction between the adjacent β-strands and the loss of the hydrophobic 
interactions between the neighboring β-sheet layers. These results are consistent with the previous 
experimental results, showing that the substitution of Tyr by Ala significantly decreases the polymerization 
rate of VQIVYK peptides [17] and that the substitution of Tyr by Gly directly abolishes the VQIVYK 
aggregations [50]. The importance of the π-π stacking interaction has also been demonstrated in many other 
amyloid-forming peptides [51,52]. 
3.5 Common structural property of amyloid fibrils: twisted β-strand 
It is well accepted that twisted β-strand is the common structural property of amyloid fibrils [53] 
although the crystal structure exhibits a planar structure [22,23]. Several theoretical studies have reported a 
common twisted β-strand pattern for many amyloidogenic peptides [24,28,48,54-62], with the twisted angles 
ranged from 9° to 20°. To gain insights into this structural feature of the models emerged from the current MD 
simulations, the twisted angles between two adjacent β-strands of the VQIVYK oligomers were analyzed and 
the results are presented in Table 2. The twisted angles of the two adjacent β-strands follow the order of 
SH1-ST2 > SH1-ST3 > SH1-ST4 > SH1-ST5 in the one-sheet models and of SH2-ST2 > SH2-ST3 > 
SH2-ST4 > SH2-ST5 in the two-sheet models, suggesting that the twisted angle between two adjacent 
β-strands is size-dependent. Our results are consistent with the previous observation, showing that the 
β-sheets with few strands tend to be associated with larger twisted angles than those containing a large 
number of strands in native proteins [63]. Along this sense, it is expected that the twisted angles should be 
relatively small in amyloid fibrils, as supported by the data from the cryo-electron microscopy experiments 
for insulin fibrils (twisted angle 1.5°-2.5°) [64] and the TEM experiments on fibrils of rationally designed 
peptides (twisted angle 1°-3°) [65] . However, our simulation results show that the averaged twisted angles 
between two adjacent β-strands of the stable VQIVYK oligomers, such as SH2-ST4 and SH2-ST5, are 
comparatively large (23.4°-26.6°). It can be attributed to the fact that twisting between two adjacent β-strands 
optimize side chain packing, which may reduce the K6-K6 repulsive interactions between two adjacent 
β-strands and generate more favorable electrostatic interactions between K6 and C terminus. Previous MD 
study has also reported a large averaged twisted angle of 20° for the amyloidogenic peptide DFNKF due to 
the optimization of the electrostatic interactions between the charged side-chains and the termini [48].  
 
4. Conclusions 
Previous experiments using transgenic mice models have reported that soluble aggregates of tau rather 
than NFTs might cause neurodegeneration [66-68], which has brought up the possibility of using the 
oligomeric forms as drug targets. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the formation of paired helical 
filaments arising from short hexapeptide motifs in the third repeat of tau, 306VQIVYK311, is critical for tau
