MEASUREMENT DESCRIPTION
The bistatic measuring facility for scattering from rough surfaces with larger surface
parameters (surface rms height, surface correlation length) is a stepped-frequency
measurement system capable of measuring the scattering matrix of the measured target by the
transmitting and receiving antenna system. We depict the diagram of the bistatic measuring
facility and the measurement system for depolarized bistatic scattering from very rough
surfaces in figure 1. It is a stepped-frequency measurement system capable of measuring the
scattering matrix of the measured target by the transmitting and receiving antenna system.
Using the HP8720 vector analyzer with an amplifier on the transmitter antenna, the system
measures a complex voltage for any pair of like and cross-polarized receiver and transmitter
polarization states.
Figure 1. System geometry for the bistatic scattering measurement
With proper calibration, it is capable of measuring all four complex elements of the scattering
matrix of the target surface. The hardware allows the transmitter and receiver to be able to
located independently at any point on a hemisphere shell 2 meters from the center of the
target for accurate measurement. The measurements shown in this paper are for the scattering
strength from random rough surfaces with varying roughness. The surfaces are characterized
by a Laser profiler for measuring the surface profiles without direct contact. The profiler has a
horizontal resolution of 1 mm and a vertical resolution of 2 mm. The receive antenna is a
dual-polarized horn antenna with a beamwidth of 15 degrees and the transmit antenna is a
dual-polarized parabolic dish with narrow beam of 5 degrees. From the measurement we find
the phenomenon of backscattering enhancement exists. The backscatter enhancement depends
upon the surface parameters, and electromagnetic frequency. A baffle made of radar
absorbing materials was placed in the direct path between the transmitter and receiver to
insure the proper insulation of the two antennas.
The measured voltage is a complex voltage and is proportional to the scattered electric field
for each polarization state. Because the scattered electric field is composed of a coherent
enhancement occurs. The scatter energy shifts from the forward direction toward backward
direction during increasing the surface rms slope. In figure 5 we show the comparisons
between the model prediction and measurement of like hh-polarized bistatic scattering along
the azimuth angle to observe the backscatter enhancement phenomenon. The
normalized surface standard deviation 6.283 and surface rms slope 0.71 versus
azimuth angle. The incident and scatter angles are chosen 200. After the comparisons we
also find good agreement reaches in like-polarized scattering. The difference is less than 1 dB
except the peak of backscatter enhancement.

Figure 1. System geometry for the bistatic scattering measurement
With proper calibration, it is capable of measuring all four complex elements of the scattering matrix of the
target surface. The hardware allows the transmitter and receiver to be able to located independently at any
point on a hemisphere shell 2 meters from the center of the target for accurate measurement. The
measurements shown in this paper are for the scattering strength from random rough surfaces with varying
roughness. The surfaces are characterized by a Laser profiler for measuring the surface profiles without
direct contact. The profiler has a horizontal resolution of 1 mm and a vertical resolution of 2 mm. The
receive antenna is a dual-polarized horn antenna with a beamwidth of 15 degrees and the transmit antenna is
a dual-polarized parabolic dish with narrow beam of 5 degrees. From the measurement we find the
phenomenon of backscattering enhancement exists. The backscatter enhancement depends upon the surface
parameters, and electromagnetic frequency. A baffle made of radar absorbing materials was placed in the
direct path between the transmitter and receiver to insure the proper insulation of the two antennas.
The measured voltage is a complex voltage and is proportional to the scattered electric field for each
polarization state. Because the scattered electric field is composed of a coherent component from the mean
surface and an incoherent component from the rough surface, the measured voltage has also a coherent and
incoherent component. The method to separate the coherent and incoherent components is based upon the
mean value. The mean value of incoherent component is zero. Provided a large number of independent
samples are measured, the coherent power is proportional to the square of the complex average of the
measured voltage and incoherent power is then proportional to the variances of the fluctuation component of
the measured data.
COMPARISONS WITH MEASUREMENTS
To evaluate the validity of the 3D measurement we compare and show the measured data with IEM model
prediction in figures 2 and 3. The data are measured for cross-polarized scattering from rough surfaces on the
incident angle of 20 degree at the EHF frequency band. The surface rms slopes are 0.14 and 0.486
respectively. For the slightly rough surface with the surface rms slope 0.14 and small surface
parameters (surface standard deviation 0.1 and standard surface correlation length 1.0) the
phenomena of backscatter enhancement occurs, but the backscatter enhancement can be ignored
due to its little strength from both the measurement and the model prediction in figure 2. On the
contrary the forward scatter strength is large enough to be observed from the measured data and the
model prediction in the forward scatter direction.
