extension to >100 km； a high split ratio (>100)； 
and using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). 
In the first year report (2009-2010), we have 
identified that RB is one of the key issues limiting 
the reach and split-ratio of the PON. We also 
compared and studied several Rayleigh backscattering 
(RB) mitigation schemes to extend the reach and 
split-ratio of PONs.  
In the second year report (2010-2011), we proposed 
using carrier-suppressed single-sideband (CS-SSB) 
modulation format to effectively reduce RB in LR-PON. 
The CS-SSB signal can be generated by dual-drive MZM 
(DD-MZM) and a dual-parallel MZM (DP-MZM) based 
optical networking units (ONUs). Due to the different 
modulation mechanisms of the two CS-SSB modulations, 
the frequency components of the generated CS-SSB 
signal are also different. The generation mechanism, 
transmission performance and dispersion tolerance of 
the two CS-SSB modulators were also analyzed and 
discussed. 
In the third year report (2011-2012), we successfully 
demonstrated high RB tolerant LR-PON using CS-SSB 
modulation, achieving 100 km reach, 512 split-ratio, 
2.5 Gb/s upstream and 10 Gb/s downstream signals. 
Then we further demonstrated a LR-PON supporting 40 
Gb/s upstream signal using orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM).

Abstract 
A strong upgrade of existing access network 
is required in order to cope with the 
exponential increase of bandwidth demand. 
The first generations of Gigabit Passive 
Optical Network (GPON) have been 
standardized and deployed in some parts of 
the world. They typically offer 2.5 Gb/s 
downstream and ~1 Gb/s upstream, shared 
among 32 customers via passive optical 
splitters and a time-division multiplexed 
(TDM) access protocol, over a reach of up to 
20 km. Researchers consider that long reach 
(LR)-PON is a potential candidate which 
comes after GPON. It usually has four new 
features: high data rate in both upstream and 
downstream signals (>1 Gb/s); reach 
extension to >100 km; a high split ratio 
(>100); and using wavelength division 
multiplexing (WDM). 
In the first year report (2009-2010), we 
have identified that RB is one of the key 
 4
novel network subsystems and architectures 
for standard-reach and LR access networks 
during this 3-year project [22-51].  
   
三、研究成果 
In the project, we have established a 
long-reach (LR) and high split-ratio PON. 
We have demonstrated theoretically and 
experimentally different LR (~100 km) and 
high split-ratio (> 512) PONs [1-15].

(ISBN: 978-1-61209-835-7), 2011 [6]. Our 
achievements in long-reach access networks 
have gained international attentions and we 
have been invited to present our results in

PON has been cited by Ref/Text Book:

Networks: Research towards unlimited 
bandwidth access,” edited by Josep Prat, 
Springer, 2008. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have summarized the main achievements 
below:  
 
(1) Rayleigh backscattering analysis of 
OFDM Signal [4, 14-15] 
Carrier distributed WDM-PONs provide 
many attractive features, however, when a 
single drop fiber is employed to reach the 
customer, the carrier distributed from the 
OLT and the upstream signal must share the 
same path, giving rise to interferometric beat 
noise caused by the RB. RB is generated by 
the distributed reflections caused by the 
random index fluctuation along the silica 
optical fiber. The RB noise is partially 
polarized in nature, with a colored power 
spectral density (PSD) proportional to the 
PSD of the input signal to the optical fiber. 
We identified two main contributions to the 
RB noise, as shown in Fig. 1.1 in the carrier 
distributed PONs. They interfere with the 
upstream signal at the receiver (Rx). The first 
contribution, Carrier-RB, is generated by the 
backscatter of the continuous wave (CW) 
carrier delivered to the reflective ONU 
(RONU). The second contribution, 
Signal-RB, is generated by the upstream data 
signal at the output of the RONU. 
Backscattered light from this upstream signal 
re-enters the RONU, and it is modulated at a 
second time (hence, having a broader 
spectrum) and transmitted towards the Rx. 
 
 6
The RB performance of a signal depends 
on the interferometric beat noise falling 
within the Rx bandwidth. The interferometric 
beat noise depends on the spectral overlap 
between the data signal and the interferers. 
Fig. 1.3 shows the measured RB 
performances by comparing the power 
penalties at BER of 10-9, as a function of 
OCSRs. For conventional NRZ signal, the 
OCSR is about -25 dB. The measurement 
result shows that the Carrier-RB performance 
of OFDM-QAM is better than its Signal-RB 
performance. This is due to the fact that 
Carrier-RB beat noise is low frequency in 
nature, and the OFDM signal is slightly 
up-converted (62.5 MHz to 1.125 GHz), 
hence, the Carrier-RB noise mainly falls 
within the frequency gap between the center 
carrier and the OFDM signal. The Signal-RB 
has a wider spectrum than the OFDM signal 
since it has been modulated twice. And the 
noise spectrum of the Signal-RB will occupy 
the whole frequency band of the OFDM 
signal, producing much higher beat noise due 
to the complete spectral overlap. As a result, 
we can observe from Fig. 1.3 that the 
Signal-RB OCSR of the OFDM signal is -30 
dB at 1-dB power penalty window. The RB 
performance of NRZ signal was also 
included. Results indicate that OFDM signal 
has similar Carrier-RB performance to NRZ 
signal, but poorer Signal-RB performance 
than NRZ signal. 
 
(2) Analysis of the CS-SSB generation 
using the DD-MZM and a DP-MZM [16-19] 
We first introduced the theoretical analysis of 
CS-SSB carrier generations using the 
DD-MZM-based and the DP-MZM-based 
ONUs. Then the transmission performances 
and the dispersion tolerances of the uplink 
signals generated by the two CS-SSB 
modulators are also analyzed and discussed. 
Results show that the CS-SSB signal 
generated by the DP-MZM has better 
transmission performance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.1 shows the architectures of the 
CS-SSB signals generated by the (a) 
DD-MZM-based and the (b) DP-MZM-based 
ONUs. For the architecture of the DD-MZM 
as shown in Fig. 1(a), the electric field at the

zero-order of the Bessel function J0(m) = 0, 
the power levels of other frequency 
components will increase. For using the 
DP-MZM, good frequency component 
cancellation of the center wavelength and the 
1st ordered lower-sideband can be observed. 
Hence, from the experiment and the vector 
diagram model, using DP-MZM can produce 
a pure CS-SSB signal with other frequency 
components suppressed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Numerical analysis of transmission 
performances for the two CS-SSB signals 
was performed using VPI Transmission 
Maker V7.5. Fig. 2.3 shows the simulation 
BER versus received power of both CS-SSB 
signals. For the signal generated by the 
DD-MZM, ~1 dB penalty is observed after 
50 km SMF transmission when compared to 
the back-to-back (b2b), and an error floor 
appears after transmission of 100 km SMF 
(dispersion parameter: 17 ps/nm/km). The 
optical filters used for both signals are the 
same, and the filter bandwidth is 50 GHz. 
For the signal generated by DP-MZM, the 
transmission distance can reach to 100 km 
SMF with negligible power penalty. From 
these results, we can see that the transmission 
performances are very different even both of 
them are performing CS-SSB modulation. 
The chromatic dispersion is related to the 
spectral width of the signal. For the signal 
generated by the DD-MZM, the dispersion 
tolerant can be improved by limiting the 
spectral width of the signal. However, by 
using a 25 GHz optical filter, an insertion 
loss of ~ 3 dB will be introduced. For the 
signal generated by the DP-MZM, the 
dispersion tolerant is independent of the filter 
bandwidths, showing that the signal does not 
require an optical filter to limit its bandwidth 
in the transmission. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) A 100-km Reach, 512-split ratio 
LR-PON using CS-SSB modulation [17] 
There are two main RB noise sources in the 
carrier-distributed LR-PON as shown in Fig. 
3.1: (i) Carrier-RB is generated by the 
backscattering of the continuous-wave (CW) 
optical carrier delivered to the ONU; and (ii) 
Signal-RB is generated by backscattering of 
the upstream data signal, which will be 
modulated again at the ONU before sending 
to the CO. For conventional 
non-return-to-zero (NRZ) signal as shown in 
Fig. 3.1(a), high RB noises occur due to a 
high spectral overlap among the upstream 
signal the both Carrier-RB and Signal-RB. 
For the proposed RB mitigation LR-PON 
using CS-SSB as shown in Fig. 3.1(b), by 
wavelength shifting the upstream signal 
away from the distributed CW carrier, 
Carrier-RB can be mitigated. The upstream 
signal will be modulated by the ONU and 
wavelength shift again; hence Signal-RB can 
also be mitigated.

(4) 40 Gb/s LR-PON using OFDM 
modulation [20-21] 
Fig. 4.1 shows the experiment setup for the 
proposed 40 Gb/s OFDM LR-PON. For the 
downstream, 4 wavelength-multiplexed CW 
lasers, which are 1546.0, 1546.8, 1547.6 and 
1548.4 nm in the CO, respectively, were used 
to generate 4×10 Gb/s OOK downstream 
data rates via four MZMs. The 4 ×10 Gb/s 
OOK downstream traffic is transmit to the 
optical Rx in each ONU via a 3 ports OC at 
the CO [port 1→port 2], the upper SMF, and 
the 4-ports OC at the ONU (port 3→port 4), 
as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the experiment, the 
SMF lengths of 20, 50 and 75 km were used. 
In the CO, 4 CW wavelengths, which are 
1550.1, 1550.9, 1551.7 and 1552.5 nm, 
respectively, were used as the external 
injection light source and launching into each 
reflective semiconductor optical amplifier 
(RSOA) on ONU for the upstream signal 
generation. As shown in Fig. 1, the CW 
injection wavelengths emitted from the CO 
via the lower SMF and 4 ports OC (port 1→
port 2) before injecting into RSOA for 
upstream signal generation. Therefore, 4×10 
Gb/s RSOA-based transmitters can be 
achieved by applying 10 Gb/s 64-QAM 
OFDM modulations to each RSOA. Then the 
upstream signals transmitted via the OC at 
the ONU (port 2→port 3), upper SMF and 
OC at the CO (port 2 → port 3) for the 
upstream traffic. RB can be mitigated in the 
proposed network.

In the experiment, the output spectra of 
downstream (blue line) and upstream 
wavelengths (red line) were measured by an 
optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) with a 0.01 
nm resolution, as shown in Fig. 4.2. The 4 
wavelength-multiplexed downstream and 
upstream channels were with 0.8 nm 
channel-spacing (100 GHz). Besides, the 
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) 
spectrum of RSOA (green line) operating at 
50 mA bias current are also included. In Fig. 
2, the background ASE noise of RSOA 
would be reduced by 15 dB while the 4 CW 
wavelengths were injected.

subcarrier at the higher frequency band 
cannot achieve the measured SNR above the 
FEC limit as shown in Fig. 4.4(d). This is 
due to fiber chromatic dispersion in the LR 
transmission.

bandwidth of 0.26 to 1.92 GHz at (a) B2B, (b) 20, (c) 50 and (d) 75 
km SMF transmissions, respectively, without dispersion 
compensation, when the different CW injection power levels of 5 to 
1 dBm are launching into RSOA. 
Based on the measured SNR 
performance of all the subcarriers in the 
OFDM signal, the average BER can be 
evaluated. Fig. 4.5 shows the BER 
measurements of the RSOA-based 
transmitter using optical 64-QAM OFDM 
modulation for upstream traffic at the B2B, 
20, 50 and 75 km SMF transmissions, 
respectively, when the injection wavelength 
and power were set at 1550.0 nm and −1 
dBm respectively. Here, we can observe the 
power penalties of 0.4, 2.1 and 5.3 dB after 
20, 50 and 75 km SMF transmissions without 
dispersion compensation, respectively. 
Although one third of the subcarrier SNR 
was below FEC limit in 75 km fiber link, as 
shown in Fig. 4.4(d), the measured average 
BER still can achieve FEC for LR 
transmission. Besides, the insets of Fig. 4.5 
are corresponding constellation diagrams at 
the BER of 3.8×10−3. We can also measure 
the Rx sensitivities were −12.8, −12.4, −10.7 
and −7.5 dBm at B2B, 20, 50 and 75 km 
fiber transmissions, respectively at the FEC 
limit. When the transmission fiber length is 
extended to 100 km long, the average BER 
cannot achieve FEC limit for upstream 
traffic.

Abstract: We demonstrate a 10-Gb/s optical-carrier-distributed network with wireless 
communication system. The 10-Gb/s W-band wireless-signal was generated by a near-ballistic-
uni-traveling-carrier-photodiode (NBUTD-PD) based transmitter optically excited by 0.1-THz 
optical pulses. 20-km optical fiber upstream transmission is achieved.

1. Introduction  
Wireless communications operated at V-band (60 GHz) has attracted much attention recently for the wireless 
smart-home applications [1]. And millimeter wave (mm-Wave) operated in higher frequency W-band (75 GHz – 
0.11 THz) [2] is of particular interests, since it can carrier much higher data rate signals. Due to the high attenuation 
in the air at this frequency band, it is very suitable for short-reach wireless transmission providing secure and 
directional communication link. In many cases, the central office (CO) is quite far away from the antenna sites, 
using copper cables to carry these high frequency signals will introduce high transmission loss and is expensive. 
Hence, radio-over-fiber (ROF) technology can be used for transmitting data to and from different antenna sites in 
optical domain by using low loss and low cost optical fiber. Also simple antenna sites (called remote antenna unit 
(RAU)) can be deployed since the ROF allows the complicated electronic signal processing to be performed 
centrally at the CO.  
In this work, we experimentally demonstrated a 10 Gb/s optical carrier distributed network with 0.1 THz short-
reach wireless communication system. The 0.1 THz mm-Wave signal was generated by a near-ballistic uni-
traveling-carrier photodiode (NBUTD-PD) based transmitter (Tx) [3] optically excited by an optical short pulses. 
The optical short pulses were generated by using a photonic mm-wave waveform generator (PMWG) [4]. The 10 
Gb/s wireless data at carrier frequency of 0.1 THz was transmitted and received via a pair of horn antennas. The 
received 10 Gb/s data was envelope-detected, amplified and used to drive an optical intensity modulator to produce 
the upstream signal sending back to the CO. Error-free transmission can be achieved in a 20 km single mode fiber 
(SMF) transmission. Numerical analysis related to the optimum repetition rate of the optical pulse source and the 
transmission performance of the upstream signal were also performed.

3.  Results and Discussion 
We has numerically analyzed the influence of the repetition rate of optical pulse for generating high quality 10 Gb/s 
received wireless signal. Commercial software VPI Transmission Maker V7.5 was used. The simulation setup was 
based on Fig. 1. Optical pulses (FWHM = 2.5 ps) with repetition rates from 10 GHz to 100 GHz was coupled to the 
PD with the OE bandwidth obtained from the experiment. The signal was then emitted and received via a pair of W-
band horn antennas (3-dB bandwidth from 75 to 110 GHz). The received signal was then amplified and envelope 
detected to produce the baseband 10 Gb/s NRZ signal, which was then used to drive an intensity modulator to 
generate the upstream signal. At the receiver side, a 1550 nm CW optical signal was distributed to the intensity 
modulator via 20 km SMF, encoded by the 10 Gb/s NRZ at the modulator, and then transmitted back to the CO via 
another 20 km SMF (dispersion parameter = 17ps/nm/km) as described in Fig. 1. The upstream signal performance 
was evaluated by the Q-value measured using the built-in function of the VPI. 
 
Fig. 3. (a) Simulated Q-values at different repetition rate optical pulses. (b) Simulated Q-values propagating through different 
lengths of SMF. (c) Experiment BER curves for the  
Fig. 3(a) shows the simulated Q-values at different repetition rate optical pulses (with 20 km + 20 km SMF 
transmission). Result shows that Q > 18 dB upstream NRZ signal can be received when the repetition > 50 GHz. 
When the repetition rate is low, the signal is more RZ-liked. And the performance of the upstream signal saturates at 
Q ~ 21 dB when 100 GHz repetition rate optical pulses are used. Hence in the experiment, 100 GHz spacing optical 
mode comb was generated using the line-to-line pulse shaper. Fig. 3(b) shows the simulated Q-values propagating 
through different lengths of SMF, showing Q > 16 dB can be obtained in 50 km transmission without dispersion 
compensation. Fig. 3(c) shows the experimental BER measurement of the upstream transmission of received 10-
Gb/s W-band wireless-signal. About 4 dB power penalty was observed when compared with the back-to-back (B2B). 
We can observe a good match in eye-shape (small amplitude overshoot in level “1” and flat in level “0”) between 
the simulation and experiment. 
4.  Conclusion 
We experimentally demonstrated a 10-Gb/s optical-carrier-distributed network with wireless communication system. 
The mm-Wave signal at carrier frequency of 0.1 THz was generated by a NBUTD-PD based Tx optically excited by 
an optical short pulses, which were generated by using a PMWG allowing spectral line-by-line pulse shaping. The 
W-band 10 Gb/s wireless data was transmitted and received via a pair of horn antennas. The received 10 Gb/s data 
was envelope-detected, amplified and used to drive an optical intensity modulator to produce the upstream signal 
sending back to the CO. Error-free 20 km SMF transmission was measured experimentally. Simulation result shows 
that Q > 18 dB upstream NRZ signal can be received when the repetition of the optical pulses > 50 GHz. It also 
shows Q > 16 dB upstream signal can be detected in 50 km SMF transmission without dispersion compensation.

OFDM subcarriers occupy 1.526 GHz bandwidth (82 MHz to 1.626 GHz) producing a data rate of 6.25 Gb/s. The 
OFDM channels 2 to 4 are up-converted to 3.164, 6.055 and 8.945 GHz by using I-Q modulation, respectively. And 
each up-converted channel has 72 OFDM subcarriers occupy 2.813 GHz bandwidth to generate a data rate of 11.25 
Gb/s, as shown in inset of Fig. 1. Therefore, the proposed four-band OFDM channels have a total bandwidth of 
10.35 GHz; resulting a downstream data rate of 40 Gb/s if all the four-band OFDM channels are used. According to 
the proposed multi-band OFDM channels, each channel only needs 5 GS/s sampling rate and 5 bits resolution DAC 
to implement 40 Gb/s signal traffic in a real LR-PON system. The DA/AD converter of 5 GS/s and 5 bits can be 
easy to accomplish in for this proposed 40 Gb/s OFDM-PON.  
Originally, each OFDM channel is designed to have 2.5 GHz bandwidth and 16-QAM OFDM modulation to 
achieve 40 Gb/s transmission rate. However, some OFDM subcarrier of baseband (Ch1) would be filtered via a 2.5 
GHz low-pass filter (LPF) while the 5 GS/s DAC is used. To overcome this problem, we can narrow the bandwidth 
of channel 1 to 1.526 GHz and augment the bandwidth of channels 2 to 4 to 2.813 GHz to fit the 5 GS/s DAC for 
practical LR-PON. 
For the downstream transmission, we analyze the transmission performance of the 40 Gb/s OFDM downstream 
signal in the LR-PON using the commercial software (VPI Transmission Maker V7.5). Here, the baseband electrical 
OFDM signal is generated by using Matlab® programs. And the signal processing of the OFDM transmitter (Tx) 
constructed by serial-to-parallel conversion, QAM symbol encoding, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), cyclic 
prefix (CP) insertion, and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC). The proposed modulation of four-band 16-QAM 
OFDM channels is applied to the MZM with a chirp parameter of 0.2. A continuous-wave (CW) optical signal at 
wavelength of 1540.0 nm is launched into the MZM to produce the optical OFDM siganl, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In 
this PON system, the OFDM downstream signal will pass through 20 to 100 km single-mode fiber (SMF) 
transmissions without dispersion compensation; and they are directly detected via a 10 GHz PIN receiver (Rx) at the 
ONU side. The received downstream OFDM signal is captured by using Matlab® programs for signal demodulation. 
To demodulate the vector signal, the off-line DSP program is employed. And the demodulation process included the 
synchronization, FFT, one-tap equalization, and QAM symbol decoding. The erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) 
with 27 dB gain and 5 dB noise figure is used to enhance power budget of downstream and compensate the losses of 
passive components. As a result, the bit error rate (BER) would be calculated according to the observed signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) of each OFDM subcarrier.

Fig. 2 presents the simulated BER performances of 40 Gb/s OFDM downstream using the proposed 16-QAM 
OFDM four-band channels at the back-to-back (B2B), 20 and 30 km SMF transmissions, respectively. In Fig. 2, we 
obtain the Rx sensitivities of −16.0 dBm at the forward error correction (FEC) threshold (BER of 3.8×10−3) at back-
to-back (B2B). After 20 km SMF transmission, the power penalty of 1.0 dB is measured at the BER of 3.8×10−3. 
This shows a better BER performance than that of 40 Gb/s/wavelength OOK or DPSK modulations in our previous 
studies [1, 2] after 20 km fiber link. When the SMF length is increased to 30 km for the 40 Gb/s OFDM signal, the 
measured BER cannot achieve the FEC threshold (3.8×10−3) due to the frequency fading and fiber chromatic 
dispersion. It is worth to mention that the issue of chromatic dispersion is severe for the higher frequency OFDM 
band.  
Therefore in this work, we propose the multi-band OFDM channels for adaptive downstream data rate 
adjustment from 6.25 to 40 Gb/s in the ONU side according to the different fiber lengths between CO and each 
ONU. We realize that the 40 Gb/s four-band OFDM channel only can support 20 km SMF transmission. And so, we 
can only receive three-band OFDM channels (Ch 1 to Ch 3) of 28.75 Gb/s data rate when the SMF exceeds 20 km to 
avoid the frequency fading and fiber dispersion. 
 Fig. 3 shows the simulated BER measurements of adaptive downstream rate of 6.25 to 40 Gb/s by dynamically 
receiving different multi-band OFDM channels under the different SMF lengths of 20 to 100 km. As seen in Fig. 3,

after 75 km fiber transmission.

1. Introduction 
In order to deliver the future broadband multi-services economically (such as data, voice, CATV, IPTV and 3D-TV 
etc.), the network operators have to reduce the cost to sustain profit margins. The possible method is to simplify the 
fiber network architecture, and hence the number of equipment interfaces and network devices can be reduced. 
Hence, long-reach (LR) access network has been proposed to solve this issue [1].  
Moreover, hybrid wavelength division multiplexing-time division multiplexing (WDM-TDM) PON has been 
considered as a potential solution for next generation PON. Due to the bandwidth-sharing of the TDM-PON, hybrid 
WDM-TDM PON would provide a relative lower per-subscriber cost than pure WDM-PON by dividing a single 
wavelength to multiple subscribers, while still maintaining a relatively high per-subscriber bandwidth [2]. Recently, 
using optical OFDM-QAM modulation in carrier-distributed PONs to effectively enhance the transmission data rate 
and reduce the cost have raised research interests [3]. In these carrier-distributed PONs, usually reflective 
semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) was used in each optical network unit (ONU) [4]. And the present 
commercially available RSOA could only achieve 2.5 Gbps OOK remodulation. Therefore, to enhance the 
transmission data rate to 10 Gbps via RSOA-based transmitter, using 2.5 GHz adaptively multiplexing optical 
OFDM (AMOOFDM) modulation has been studied [5]. However, this only could transmit 20 km fiber distance also 
with the help of forward error correction (FEC).  
In this work, we propose a 10 Gbps upstream traffic in a carrier-distributed LR-PON using a 1.2 GHz 
bandwidth RSOA-based ONU via a larger power of seeding light. Here, 64-QAM OFDM modulation is used to 
generate 10 Gbps data rate. And, 20, 50 and 75 km long single-mode fiber (SMF) transmissions respectively, are 
experimented in the proposed PON system to realize the relationships of transmission length and signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR). Moreover, we also discuss and analyze the upstream traffic performance when different CW injection 
levels are launched into RSOA. 
2. Experiment and results 
Fig. 1 presents the proposed carrier-distributed hybrid WDM-TDM PON using RSOA-based ONU for 10 Gbps 
optical OFDM-QAM modulation upstream traffic. In the CO, we use two wavelength bands for the downstream data 
and CW signals distributing to each ONU via a 1×N WDM multiplexer and a 1×M optical splitter (OS). The 
downstream data and CW wavelengths are divided by a 1×2 WDM coupler (WC) into on each ONU, as shown in 
Fig. 1. Here, the CW wavelength will launch into the RSOA to generate the upstream optical OFDM-QAM signal. 
Generally, the optical amplifier was used on remote node (RN) to solve the power budget in LR-PON transmission 
[1].

Here, the bit error rate (BER) can be calculated and obtained based on the observed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
of each OFDM subcarrier. In the experiment, first we investigate the SNR performance under different fiber 
transmissions. Thus, Fig. 4 shows the measured SNR of each OFDM subcarrier in the frequency bandwidth of 0.26 
to 1.92 GHz with different SMF transmissions at back-to-back (B2B), 20, 50 and 75 km respectively, without 
dispersion compensation, under different CW injection power levels of −3 to 0 dBm launching into RSOA. In this 
measurement, the optical received power is fixed at −6 dBm, and the CW injection power of −2 dBm is launched 
into RSOA. The entire measured subcarriers can achieve the forward error correction (FEC) threshold (BER of 
3.8×10−3) [7], at B2B, 20 km and 50 km, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. However, when the transmission fiber 
length is 75 km, the measured SNR for some high frequency subcarrier cannot achieve FEC threshold due to fiber 
chromatic dispersion. As also shown in Fig. 4, the subcarriers at higher frequency would experience SNR penalty 
under different fiber lengths owing to the reduction in relaxation oscillation frequency of the RSOA. 
Then, we experiment the BER measurements in different CW injection levels and transmission lengths. Fig. 5 
shows the BER performances of RSOA-based upstream signal at the B2B, 20, 50, and 75 km SMF transmissions, 
respectively, in the CW injection power levels of 4 to −10 dBm, when the received power is fixed at −6 dBm. And 
the inserts of Fig. 5 are the corresponding constellation diagrams measured at FEC threshold. To achieve the FEC 
threshold level at the B2B, 20, 50 and 75 km transmissions, the minimum CW injection powers must be larger than 
−9, −8, −6 and −1 dBm, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 5. According to the measured results, the 10 Gbps 
upstream transmission using RSOA-based ONU can be achieved based on the different CW injection power levels 
for the standard-reach (20 km) or long-reach (60~100 km) applications.  
Next, according to the measured results of Fig. 5, we set the CW injection power of −1 dBm launching into 
RSOA for the upstream signal transmission. Fig. 6 presents the BER performances of RSOA-based 10 Gbps 64-
QAM OFDM upstream signal at the B2B, 20, 50 and 75 km SMF propagations, respectively. And the inserts of Fig. 
6 are corresponding constellation diagrams. In Fig. 6, we can observe the received powers at −12.6, −12.2, −10.8 
and −7.4 dBm at B2B, 20, 50 and 75 km fiber transmissions, respectively, at the FEC threshold level. Moreover, the 
measured power penalties of 0.4, 1.8 and 5.1 dB can be observed after 20, 50 and 75 km SMF transmissions, 
respectively, at the BER of 3.8×10−3. As a result, to achieve 10 Gb/s data traffic and 75 km transmission length, the 
RSOA requires a larger power of seeding light as mentioned above. 
3. Conclusion 
We have proposed and demonstrated a 10 Gbps upstream traffic in a carrier-distributed LR-PON using a 
commercially available 1.2 GHz bandwidth RSOA-based ONU via a larger power of seeding light. And 64-QAM 
optical OFDM modulation was used. In this carrier-distributed PON, a CW optical signal was launched into the 
RSOA from the CO, and 20, 50 and 75 km SMF transmissions were evaluated. In the measurement, when the CW 
injection power was −1 dBm, the SMF transmission length of RSOA-based upstream could achieve 20, 50 and 75 
km, simultaneously, at the FEC threshold level (BER = 3.8×10−3). The generated penalties of 0.4, 1.8 and 5.1 dB 
were also measured after 20, 50 and 75 km fiber transmissions, respectively, in the proposed RSOA-based ONU 
LR-PON system.

encoding, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, and digital-to-analog conversion 
(DAC). 12 GS/s sampling rate and 8-bit DAC resolution were produced by the AWG, and the CP of 1/64 was set in 
the measurement. Here, 127 subcarriers of M-QAM (M = 16, 32 and 64) OFDM formats occupied nearly 2.5 GHz 
bandwidth of 1.95 MHz to 2.50 GHz, with a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) size of 512, and the Vpp was set at same 
value of 0.6 V. Hence, yielding ~2 MHz subcarrier spacing and 10, 12.5 and 15 Gb/s total traffic rate could be 
achieved, respectively. So, the produced electrical M-QAM OFDM signals could be applied on the LDR and LDB via 
a bias-tee (BT).

In the experiment, the feeder fiber and distribution fiber were set at 15 and 5 km long. The R- and B-band 
downstream signals of CO passed through the upper and lower fibers and the RN for crossing transmission, as 
shown in Fig. 1. And then the R-band downstream would inject into RSOA via the lower fiber for generating the 
remodulated 2.5 Gb/s OOK upstream. Here, first we will experiment and analyze the performance of downstream 
OFDM signal. The B-band OFDM downstream signal transmitted through the proposed PON system and directly 
detected via a 2.5 GHz PIN receiver (Rx) at ONU side. The received downstream OFDM signal was captured by a 
real-time 12.5 GHz sampling oscilloscope for signal demodulation. To demodulate the vector signal, the off-line 
DSP program was employed. And the demodulation process included the synchronization, FFT, one-tap 
equalization, and QAM symbol decoding. Therefore, the bit error rate (BER) would be calculated based on the 
observed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract— We discuss recent progress in the research of the 
optically amplified, long-reach WDM PONs, which aim to reduce 
the cost and the complexity of future fiber-to-the-home systems. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Passive optical networks (PONs) are being deployed in 
many countries to meet the emerging broadband services 
requirement by end-users. The most advanced of these (GPON, 
GEPON and 10GEPON) have been standardized and 
commercially available. In order to significantly reduce the 
cost, complexity and power consumption of the present PONs, 
long-reach (LR) PONs have been proposed [1-4]. LR-PON 
usually requires the following key features: 
y Long distance (~60-100 km): LR-PON can integrate the 
metro and access networks into a system to reduce the 
number of network elements and interconnection 
interfaces. Optical amplifiers are usually needed. 
y High split-ratio: This can maximize the utilization and 
sharing of equipments and optical fiber. 
y High data rate: This can increase the bandwidth per 
customer to meet the bandwidth demand in the future. 
y Using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM): This 
can improve the bandwidth utilization of optical fiber. 
In this paper we will discuss the recent progress in the 
research of WDM LR-PON. Some key design issues of the 
physical layer implementation of the LR-PON are outlined. 
The challenges and possible solutions are discussed. 
II. SYSTEM DESIGN ISSUES 
A. Colorless RONU 
In WDM LR-PON, one of the challenging issues is to 
simplify the administration of the wavelength assignment to 
different optical networking units (ONUs). Using tunable laser 
source in each ONU is still too expensive nowadays. Hence, 
using wavelength-independent (or colorless) reflective (R) 
ONU with optical carrier distribution could be a promising 
candidate. This can reduce the inventory cost since the same 
components can be used in each RONU in the networks. 
Besides, the optical equipments, such as laser source can be 
shared by all the RONUs in a time-division-multiplexed (TDM) 
PON. 
Fig. 1 shows one of our proposed system architectures. One 
advantage of this architecture is that all the WDM components 
are located in relatively controlled environments, in the remote 
node (RN) and the central office (CO), where electrical power 
supply for the optical and electronic components is already 
present. For the upstream signal (US), a continuous wave (CW) 
optical carrier is distributed from the RN to the RONU via 
passive fiber splitter and 25 km distribution and drop fibers. 
The generated US are then transmitted to the CO via the 25 km 
and 75 km single mode fiber (SMF). The downstream signal 
(DS) is sent from the CO using another wavelength. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although the carrier distribution scheme provides many 
advantages as mentioned above, it will produce Rayleigh 
backscattering (RB) noise at the upstream receiver (US-Rx) at 
the CO. For effective RB mitigation, we can reduce the spectral 
overlap between the US and the RB. Hence the beat noise will 
fall outside the Rx bandwidth. We have proposed several 
solutions to mitigate the RB noise, including: 
y Using carrier suppressed single sideband (CS-SSB) 
modulation at the RONU [5]. 
y Using carrier suppressed subcarrier-amplitude modulated 
phase shift keying (CSS-AMPSK) at the RONU with 
offset-filtering at the CO [6].

We established long-reach (LR) and high split-ratio passive-optical-network 
(PON). We demonstrated theoretically (Opt. Express, 19, pp. 10973, 2011) and 
experimentally LR (~100 km) and high split-ratio (> 512) PON (Opt. Express, 19, 
pp. 4970, 2011) and achieving symmetric 40 Gb/s high data rate (OFT, 18, pp 63, 
2012). Through this project, the applicant received the award ’國科會 98 年度
吳大猷先生紀念獎’. The applicant has also been invited to contribute book 
chapters to the ’Advances in Lasers and Electro Optics,’ In-Tech (ISBN: 
978-953-307-088-9), 2010, and to the ’Optical Amplifiers,’ Nova Publishers 
(ISBN: 978-1-61209-835-7), 2011. Besides, through this 3-year project, we have 
generated more than 50 SCI international journal papers. Our achievements in LR 
access networks have gained international attentions and we have been invited to 
present our results in different invited talks in International conferences: IEEE 
Photonics Society Annual Meeting (LEOS) (invited talk) in USA, 2010； HSIC (invited 
talk) in Singapore, 2010； OECC (invited talk) in Taiwan, 2011； ICOCN (invited 
talk) in China, 2011； OECC (invited workshop) in Hong Kong, 2009； SPIE Photonics 
West (invited talk) in USA, 2009. For the invited talk in the IEEE Photonics Society 
Annual Meeting in 2010, we are the only Taiwan’s group among other invited papers 
in the section of Optical Networks and Systems. Other invited groups are Siemens,
