英文摘要 
Green Supply Chain Management has been an important and urgent issue because of the 
rapid decline of energy resources and environmental balance.  Conventional approach to 
environment management is placed on the production and its environmental impacts. The 
purpose is to reduce the pollution through different ways of disposal and recycle. However, 
this approach will cause not only a large amount of cost, but also high level of managerial 
risk.   
Based on the concept of “prior prevention is better than post correction”, environment 
management should begin with green design of a product, through its different functions in 
the life cycle such as production, purchasing, sales, marketing and consumption. Along such 
life cycle, the polluted risk embedded at each stage should be taken into serious account. 
Thus, such approach to environment management will ensure the environmental impact free 
and achieve sustaining enterprise. 
This study is thus focused on the establishment of risk management model from 
environment aspects such that by incorporating the market side of information from 
Subprojects 2 and 3, not only risk factors along the life cycle of a product can be detected 
and assessed; but also the strategies to reduce the impacts will be proposed. Therefore, the 
green product supply chain management information can be set up by Sub-project 1.

2. GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN LOGISTICS 
 
Green supply chain refers to all those activities associated with the transformation and flow of 
goods and services, including their information flows, from the sources of materials to end users. 
Management refers to integration of all these activities, both internal and external to the firm 
(Bowersox and Closs, 1996). According to De Groene and Hermans (1998), integrated supply 
chain management aims to close material cycles and prevent leakage of the materials in the chain. 
Similar to integrating supply chains, GSC aims to combine all information in many stages.  
Fleischmann, M. et al. (1997) mentioned GSC may include members of the forward channel 
(e.g. traditional manufacturers, retailers, and logistics service providers) or specialized parties 
(e.g. secondary material dealers and material recovery facilities). One of the key aspects to green 
supply chains is to improve both economic and environmental performance simultaneously 
throughout the chains by establishing long-term relationships between buyers and suppliers (Zhu, 
Q. and Raymond P. C., 2004). Therefore, building a stable close-loop logistics in a chain is 
necessary when the object of minimizing the total cost is desired from both the companies and 
environment aspects.  
A supply chain is a network of suppliers, manufacturing sites, distribution centers (DCs) and 
customer locations through logistics. In a general supply chain network through logistics, the 
routing always means the shipping units.  This is different in a GSC system. In a GSC logistics 
problem, there is an important module, dismantlers or recyclers, in-cooperated into a supply chain 
network.  These dismantlers handle the recovered resources into many different types for further 
uses or dispose (Baumgarten et al., 2003). That is, if at dismantler sites, the recycled resources 
can be used again, the resource should be shipped to a manufacture for reproduction; otherwise, 
the un-useful resources must be landfilled (e.g. Schultmann et al., 2006). 
The logistics system in GSC collects the used resources for further treatment, and this 
behavior in the system called reverse logistics. The routing in reverse logistics implies a recovery 
action including collecting, shipping and allocating activities. The concepts of logistics in GSC 
can be showed in Fig. 1.

Because the recovery and landfilling rates are the estimated proportional values of demand 
and recovery amount, they are non-integral.  Therefore, in order to maintain integral properties, 
Gauss symbol is used in our mathematical model and the model is shown below with TC as the 
total cost:

The objective is to minimize total cost of the transportation and the operations. The 
constraints mainly contain two types: one is for limited capacities and the other is for the law of 
flow conservation. Except 0-1 variables, all other variables must also be integral, because the 
variables mean the basic unit of logistics. This means with Gauss variable, this non-linear 
program needs to be transformed into a linear model as presented in the following section.

The Gauss’ symbol exists in order to present the GSC scenario directly and that will help to

cp  and 'lp  are the given parameters which mean the difference between max possible 
percentage and current recovery rate and landfilling rate, respectively. 
We can apply binary search to find these two parameters’ upper and lower bound which will 
not change the base solution. The process as follow: 
 
Step 1: Let 2θ =0 and 1θ =1. Use binary search in 1θ  between 0 and 1to obtain the optimal 
solution. If the base solutions are not change in 2θ =0 and 1θ =1 then stop, else continue the 
binary search until 1θ  have a value +1θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 
2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the solution will change by increasing a tiny value. This step can find 
marginal upper bound of recovery rate. 
Step 2: Let 2θ =0 and 1θ =-1. Use binary search in 1θ  between 0 and -1to obtain the optimal 
solution. If the base solutions are not change in 2θ =0 and 1θ =-1then stop, else continue the 
binary search until 1θ  have a value −1θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 
2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the solution will change by decreasing a tiny value.This step can find 
marginal lower bound of recovery rate. 
Step 3: Let 1θ =0 and 2θ =1. Use binary search in 2θ  between 0 and 1 to obtain the optimal 
solution. If the base solutions are not change in 1θ =0 and 2θ =1 then stop, else continue the 
binary search until 2θ  have a value +2θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 
2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the solution will change by increasing a tiny value. This step can find 
marginal upper bound of landfilling rate. 
Step 4: Let 1θ =0 and 2θ =-1. Use binary search in 2θ  between 0 and -1 to obtain the optimal 
solution. If the base solutions are not change in 1θ =0 and 2θ =-1 then stop, else continue the 
binary search until 2θ  have a value −2θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 
2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the solution will change by decreasing a tiny value. This step can find 
marginal lower bound of landfilling rate. 
Step 5: Let 2θ = −2θ  and 1θ = −1θ . If the base solution are not change relatively to 2θ =0 and 
1θ =0, then go to step 6, else continue the binary search in 1θ  between 0 and −1θ until 1θ  have a 
new value *1−θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the 
 14
Step 11: Let 1θ = +1θ  and 2θ = −2θ . If the base solution are not change relatively to 2θ =0 and 
1θ =0, then go to step 12, else continue the binary search in 2θ  between 0 and −2θ  until −2θ  have 
a new value *2−θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the 
solution will change by decreasing a tiny value. Let +2θ = *2−θ . 
Step 12: Let 1θ = +1θ  and 2θ = +2θ . If the base solution are not change relatively to 2θ =0 and 
1θ =0, then go to step 13, else continue the binary search in 2θ  between 0 and +2θ until 2θ  have 
a new value *2
+θ  that the base solutions are not change relatively to 2θ =0 and 1θ =0 and the 
solution will change by increasing a tiny value. Let +2θ = *2+θ . 
Step 13: Repeat step 5 to 12 until previous step *1
+θ , *1−θ , *2+θ  and *2−θ  are equal to current 
step *1
+θ , *1−θ , *2+θ  and *2−θ , then stop and print the answer. 
 
We can ensure that landfilling rate between '2 ll pp
++θ and '2 ll pp −+θ  and recovery rate 
between '1 cc pp
++θ and '1 cc pp −+θ  will have the same optimal policy. We operated the numerical 
example used before to test and verify the process can obtain the optimal range. Recovery and 
landfilling rate in previous numerical example are assumed 10% ( cp = lp =0.1), and we assumed 
the max possible percentage for each rate is 12% ( 'cp = 'lp =0.02). 
By the above process, the example operation all steps as follow:
