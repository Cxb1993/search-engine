1. Introduction
Friction stir welding (FSW) was invented at The Welding Institute (TWI) of UK in 1991 as a
solid-state joining technique [1]. In FSW, a non-consumable rotating tool with a specially designed
pin and shoulder is plunged into the interface between two plates to be joined and traversed along
the line of joint. Localized heating is produced by the friction between the rotating tool and the
workpiece to raise the local temperature of material to the range where it can be plastically
deformed easily. As the rotating tool traversed along the joint line, metal is essentially extruded
around the tool before being forged by the large down pressure [2-5]. The material flow during
FSW is quite complex depending on the tool geometry, process parameters, and material to be weld.
Reynolds and coworkers [2, 3] investigated the material flow behavior in FSW using a marker
insert technique. They suggested that there is a secondary, circular motion around the longitudinal
axis of the weld, which is a combined result of the stirring action and the extrusion around the pin.
The intense plastic deformation around the tool and the friction between tool and workpiece both
contribute to the temperature increase in the stirred zone of FSW. However, temperature
measurements within the stirred zone are very difficult due to the intense plastic deformation
produced by the rotation and translation of the tool. The maximum temperature in the stirred zone
during FSW of various aluminum alloys is found to be between 0.6 Tm and 0.9 Tm, which depends
on the ratio of rotation rate to translation speed [5]. Generally, an increase in the ratio of rotation
rate to translation speed will increase the peak temperature in FSW. A comprehensive literature
review on friction stir welding has been given by Mishra and Ma [5].
Based on the principles of FSW, Mishra et al. [6] developed friction stir processing (FSP) for
microstructural modification of materials. FSP has been shown as an effective technique in many
applications: (a) to form ultrafine grained structure in Al-alloys [7-10] and Mg-alloy [11], (b) to
produce a fine-grained microstructure, which exhibits superplasticity [12-15], (c) to homogenize the
microstructure of nanocomposite aluminum alloys [16], (d) to refine the microstructure of cast
aluminum alloy [17, 18], and (e) to fabricate a surface composite of Al-SiC on an aluminum
substrate [19]. Recently, FSP has been successfully applied to produce ultrafine–grained Al-Al2Cu
in-situ composite from Al-Cu elemental powder mixture [20].
Metal–matrix composites (MMCs) are an important class of material for structural and
electrical applications [21]. Particulate-reinforced metal–matrix composites are of particular interest
because of their easy fabrication, low cost, and isotropic properties. In conventionally processed
power metallurgy composites, the reinforcing particles are formed prior to addition to the matrix
metal. In this case, the scale of reinforcing phase is limited by the starting powder size, which is
typically of the order of microns to tens of microns and rarely below 1m. Other drawbacks for the
conventionally processed MMCs that have to be overcome are poor interfacial bonding and poor
wettability between the reinforcement and the matrix due to surface contamination of the
reinforcements. It is widely recognized that the mechanical properties of MMCs are controlled by
the size and volume fraction of the reinforcements as well as the nature of the matrix-reinforcement
interface [21]. Superior mechanical properties can be achieved when fine and stable reinforcements
5582 universal testing machine with an initial strain rate of 1×10-3 s-1. The dimensions of the gauge
section of tensile specimens were 3 mm in diameter and 14 mm in gauge length. Rectangular
specimens with dimensions of 4x4x6 mm3 were used for compression tests. The stress direction
was aligned along the traverse direction of the FSP.
3. Results
3.1 Al-Cu alloys
The hypoeutectic and near eutectic composition of Al-Cu alloy were considered. The eutectic
temperature is 821 K±1 K, and composition is generally accepted as 82.7 at.% Al. The maximum
solid solubility of Cu in Al is 2.48 at.% at 821 K. The phase Al2Cu has a tetragonal structure. In
order to study the evolution of the different alloy microstructures, process was performed with Cu
contents in the range from 5, 10 at.% and 15 at.% denoted as Al-5Cu, Al-10Cu and Al-15Cu. To
improve the billet strength for easier handling in FSP, the green compact was sintered for 20 min in
air at either 773 K or 803 K. A tool rotation with speed of 700 rpm was used, and the rotating tool
was traversed at a speed of 45 mm/min along the long axis of the billet. In order to obtain a fully
dense solid from a powder compact, two and four FSP passes were applied to the billet.
An optical micrograph of the cross-section perpendicular to the tool traverse direction (TD)
after two FSP passes of Al-15Cu specimen is shown in Fig. 2. The shape of the stirred zone (SZ) is
clearly shown, in which the tool advancing side (AS) and retreating side (RS) are also indicated.
The tangent of the tool rotation along AS is in the same direction of TD, while it is opposite to TD
along RS. The typical onion ring type microstructure can be observed in the cross-section of SZ.
3.1.1 Influence of sintering temperature on the sintered microstructure
Before FSP, the green compact was sintered to provide enough strength to prevent fracture as
the rotating tool plunging into it. Two different sintering temperatures, 773 K and 803 K, were
investigated. Both sintering temperature could fulfill the purpose. The X-ray diffraction patterns
were used to identify the phases present in the specimens after sintering as shown in Fig. 3. After
sintering at 773 K, some Cu had reacted with Al to form Al2Cu, but significant amount of Cu
remained unreated. There were copper oxides (CuO and Cu2O) present in the as-sintered specimens,
which were resulted from oxidation during sintering in air. After sintering at 803 K, only diffraction
peaks of Al and Al2Cu appeared.
The microstructure of the as-sintered material is revealed by backscattered electron image (BEI)
in Fig. 4. In this micrograph, the dark phase is aluminum matrix, whereas the white phase is Cu-rich
phase, the light gray phase is Al2Cu. Two specimens sintered at 803 K were examined. In the
Al-15Cu-A specimen, the microstructure consists of bulky Al2Cu, Al-Al2Cu eutectic structure and
large amount of Al as shown in Fig. 4a. However, the Al-15Cu-B specimen, sintered at the same
condition, shows mainly Al-Al2Cu eutectic structure with some pro-eutectic aluminum as shown in
Fig. 4b. The inconsistency of the microstructure formed at the same sintering condition may be
attributed to overheating associated with the exothermic Al-Cu reaction during sintering at 803 K.
aluminum matrix, the white phase is Cu-rich phase, and the light gray phase is Al2Cu. The
microstructure of FS processed specimens was observed by SEM/BEI as shown in Fig. 9a. It
indicated that Cu-rich particles are homogenous distribution in the aluminum matrix after two FSP
passes of Al-5Cu alloy. The Cu-rich particles were refined to below 1-5 m. There are very small
amount of Cu or Cu-rich phase present, which is below the detection limit of x-ray diffraction. Fig.
9b is a SEM/SEI micrograph at higher magnification showing the distribution of nanometer size
particles as well as micrometer size particles, which were revealed after etching with Keller’s
solution.
Fig. 10 shows the typical micrograph Al-10Cu alloy produced by FSP. The microstructure after
four FSP passes is similar to that produced by two passes, in which small amount of Cu-rich
particles still remain in Al matrix. The Al-15Cu alloy produced by two FSP passes exhibits a duplex
structure of Al-Al2Cu, in which the Al2Cu phase has irregular shape and is nearly interconnected as
shown in Fig. 11.
Based on the XRD results, Cu have been fully reacted to from Al2Cu after two FSP passes. In
Table 1, the volume fraction of Al2Cu particles in each specimen is calculated by assuming that Cu
is fully reacted to form Al2Cu. From image analyses of the SEM/BEI images, the sizes of Al2Cu
particle in Al-5Cu and Al-10Cu were quantitatively determined. In general, the average size of
Al2Cu particles has been refined to the micrometer level. To increase FSP passes from two to four
causes little effect on the size distribution of Al2Cu particles. In Al-15Cu, the Al2Cu particles cannot
be defined because of the interconnection between them.
The cross-section of SZ in specimens produced by FSP was also examined by the use of TEM.
Typical microstructures of are shown in Fig. 12. As shown in Fig. 12a, the grain sizes of both
phases (Al and Al2Cu) were refined to below 1-2 m. The Al2Cu grains were also confirmed by
EDX analysis, which showed that the Cu-rich grains contained 35±5 at% Cu. In addition, some
nanometer size particles (<100 nm) were found within aluminum grains (Fig. 12b). These fine
particles dispersed in Al grains were also identified as Al2Cu (Fig. 12c). In addition, the Al2Cu
grains were often found to be connected as shown in Fig. 12a and 12b. The interconnected Al2Cu
grains shown by TEM are consistent with the irregular particle shape revealed by SEM as shown in
Fig. 11b. In Fig. 12c, bright field image shows the dispersed particles (Al2Cu). The dispersed
particles within Al grain were found to interact with dislocation as shown in Fig. 12d.
By combining the observations of both SEM and TEM, the size distribution of Al2Cu is
bi-model, including micrometer size particles and nanometer size particles dispersed in Al grains.
The micrometer size Al2Cu particles revealed by SEM are consisted of several grains as shown in
TEM. Quantitative results of the average size of Al grains, Al2Cu grains consisting the micrometer
size particles, and fine Al2Cu particles dispersed in Al grains for various alloys and processing
conditions are listed in Table 2. In general, the average size of aluminum grains has been refined to
about 1 micrometer. From Table 2, we also have the following observations.
(1) With the same processing condition, the Al grain size decreases slightly with increasing the Cu
content. The Al2Cu grains increases with increasing the Cu content.
shown in Fig. 17. The 883 K sintered specimen was also examined by SEM/BEI (backscattered
electron image). The Al3Ti phase (light gray) was found to enclose the Ti particles (white) as shown
in Fig. 18a In addition, Al3Ti nodules, consisting faceted particles of a few micrometer size, were
also observed (Fig. 18b). In order to avoid the formation of coarse Al3Ti particles, the billets for
FSP were sintered at 823 K for 20 min.
3.2.2 Al-Ti reaction during FSP
XRD was used to identify the phases present in the stirred zone of specimens during FSP. The
diffraction patterns showed that Ti was reacted with Al to form Al3Ti, but some unreacted Ti
remained after four FSP passes. A typical example of the XRD patterns of the FSP specimen is
shown in Fig. 19. The time that material is affected by the rotating pin in FSP can be considered as
the processing time. Based upon the pin diameter and the tool traversing speed, the processing time
is estimated to be about 8 s. Therefore, the formation of Al3Ti phase is very rapid in FSP. The
microstructure of FS processed specimens was observed by SEM/BEI as shown in Fig. 20. The
white particles of micrometer size are pure Ti which has been verified by EDS (energy dispersive
spectroscopy), and the very fine gray particles (<100 nm) are Al3Ti particles which are uniformly
dispersed in Al matrix. After FSP, the average size of Ti particles has been refined from ~ 40m to
about 1-5m. Some of the Ti particles after FSP show an irregular morphology (Fig. 20b). The
appearance of irregular morphology at the interface between Ti and Al + Al3Ti suggests that liquid
phase might exist at the Al-Ti reaction front. The liquid phase is considered as aluminum melt,
which is resulted from the exothermic Al-Ti reaction. The liquid Al can penetrate into Ti particle
and react rapidly with Ti to form Al3Ti phase. The Al3Ti particles are effectively removed and
dispersed in the aluminum matrix by the large plastic strain imposed in FSP. Thus, the reaction can
proceed rapidly at the Al-Ti interface.
From image analyses of the SEM/BEI images, the amount of residual Ti was quantitatively
determined. Since Al3Ti is the only reaction product between Al and Ti observed in the present case,
the volume fraction of Al3Ti particles in each specimen can be calculated from the reacted Ti. The
quantitative results of unreacted Ti and the volume fraction of Al3Ti particles in each specimen are
listed in Table 5. In order to increase the reaction, large number passes, eight passes, were
introduced. After increasing the passes to eight, the pure Ti particles still exist. In general, the Al3Ti
content for each composition increases with increasing FSP passes. The values of microhardness of
the SZ, which are also listed in Table 5, show a general increasing trend with increasing Al3Ti
content. For Al-15Ti after 4 FSP passes, the volume fraction of Al3Ti is close to 0.5, which results in
a hardness value of ~200 Hv. The microhardness of these Al-Al3Ti composites are found to increase
linearly with the volume fraction of Al3Ti, i.e., the microhardness increases 3 Hv for every 1vol.%
Al3Ti, as shown in Fig. 21.
From microscopic observations, the SZ was found to be free of porosity. In addition, the
measured density of material cut from SZ agrees well with the theoretical density. These evidences
indicate that the FS processed sample is fully dense.
material, the Young’s modulus reaches 114 GPa.
(e) Both Al-5Ti and Al-10Ti exhibit good tensile ductility. However, Al-15Ti shows limited tensile
elongation, which may be attributed to the presence of large amount of Al3Ti particles (V =
0.47-0.49) in the composite.
(f) Materials produced with higher tool rotating speed (1400 rpm) exhibit lower yield strengths as
compared with those produced by 700 rpm. This difference is more evident in tensile tests than
in compressive tests. This may be related to the higher temperature introduced by the higher tool
rotating speed, which may cause coarser microstructure.
(g) The compressive yield strength is higher than the tensile strength for all the material.
4. Discussion
4.1 In-situ reaction and microstructure development in FSP
4.1.1 Al-Ti system
In FSP, the time that the material is subjected to the thermomechanical action is very short, in
the order of seconds. The Al-Ti reaction must be very fast. From differential thermal analysis (DTA),
the major exothermic reaction between Al and Ti was found to occur after the melting of Al and to
peak at ~1028 K (Fig. 27). Based on the irregular morphology of the interface between Ti and the
reaction zone shown in Fig. 20b, one may suspect that liquid phase might have been present at the
Ti/Al interface.
It is suggested that the rapid Al-Ti reaction in FSP may be attributed to the following
mechanisms.
(1) The large plastic strain (ε~40) in FSP [35] can shear the metal powders and break the oxide film
surrounding Al and Ti particles, which cause intimate contact between Al and Ti.
(2) The heat provided by the friction stir of the rotating tool can raise the temperature high enough
to initiate the exothermic reaction between Al and Ti.
(3) The heat of formation for Al3Ti at 298 K is -35.6 kJ/g-atom and the heat of fusion of Al at 933 K
is 10.8 kJ/g-atom [36]. The heat release due to the exothermic reaction can raise the temperature
and accelerate the reaction. As a first approximation, the adiabatic temperature rise in Al-matrix
due to the formation of Al3Ti is estimated to be ~1000 K by taking the heat capacity as ~25
J/K-mol [36]. The heat release may be high enough to cause local melting of Al at the Al-Ti
interface, which can enhance the reaction. The irregular morphology of the interface between Ti
and the reaction zone shown in Fig. 20b indicate that liquid phase might have been present at
the Ti-Al interface. However, the heat generated at the Al-Ti interface may dissipate rapidly into
the surrounding aluminum because of the presence of large amount of Al. Therefore, only local
melting is expected.
(4) The large plastic strain imposed in FSP can effectively remove the Al3Ti particles such that
direct contact between Al and Ti can be maintained. Thus, the reaction can proceed rapidly at
the interface. Since the Al3Ti particles are removed rapidly from the interface and the low
diffusivity and solubility of Ti in Al, the growth of the particles is limited and nanometer sized
The Young’s modulus of particulate reinforced composites can be predicted from the Halpin-Tsai
equation [38]

Ec, Em, Ep are the Young’s moduli of the composite, matrix, and particle, respectively, is an
adjustable parameter, and V is the volume fraction of the second phase particles. For these
composites, Em = 70 GPa [36], EP (Al2Cu) = 115 GPa [39] and EP (Al3Ti) = 216 GPa [40]. By
taking= 1, the measured Young’s moduli of Al-Si, Al-Al2Cu and Al-Al3Ti composites agree well
with the predictions of Halpin-Tsai equation as shown in Fig. 28. For Al-Al2Cu composites, the
composite modulus increases ~0.5 GPa for every 1 vol.% second phase particles. Because Al3Ti has
higher modulus, the modulus of Al- Al3Ti composites increases ~1 GPa for every 1 vol.% Al3Ti.
4.2.2 Residual stresses in the composites produced by FSP
In Al-Al3Ti composites shown in Table 7, the compressive yield strength is always higher than
the tensile strength for all the material. It is also noted that the difference between compressive and
tensile yield strength increases with the Ti content as well as the tool rotating speed as shown in Fig.
29. This phenomenon may be attributed to the presence of residual stress in the composites. There
are two possible causes for the residual stress in the composites produced by FSP.
(1) The temperature gradient in FSW may result in significant tensile residual stress along the
welding direction [41]. This residual stress is supported by the material surrounding the stir
zone. As the testing specimens were machined from the SZ, the residual stress must be relaxed
considerably. Therefore, this could not be the major cause for the tension-compression strength
difference.
(2) The residual stress may result from the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
between the aluminum matrix and the Al3Ti particles. The CTE of Al3Ti is not known, but it is
believed that the intermetallic compound has lower CTE than aluminum does. When the
Al-Al3Ti composite is cooled down from the processing temperature, tensile residual stresses
are expected in the aluminum matrix. This means that when the composite is loaded, plastic
flow occurs earlier in tension than in compression. The magnitude of the residual stress due to
differential thermal contraction is expected to increase with the processing temperature, which
increases with the Ti content and the tool rotating speed. Thus, the differential thermal
contraction between Al and Al3Ti is believed as the major cause for the difference between
compressive and tensile yield strength.
Similar phenomenon was observed in Al-Al2Cu composites, as shown in Table 4, the
compressive yield strength is always higher than the tensile yield strength for all the materials, and
composites. The potential contributions to strength by work hardening and quench strengthening
and load sharing effect are difficult to predict quantitatively for the composites studied in the
present work. In the following, only contributions due to Orowan strengthening and grain and
substructure strengthening will be discussed.
In Al-Cu system, most of the second phase particles, whose size is larger than 1 m, are
located intergranularly in the Al matrix. Therefore, they can not contribute to the strength by the
Orowan mechanism, because they do not direct interact with the moving dislocations inside Al
grains. On the other hand, the fine particles located within Al grains should contribute to the
strength by the Orowan mechanism. In the Al-Ti system, the fine Al3Ti particles are uniformly
distributed in the Al matrix, both intergranularly and intragranulkarly. Therefore, they can
contribute to the strength by the Orowan mechanism.
Al-Ti system
In Al-Ti system according to the characteristics of the microstructure, the major contributions to
the yield strength of the Al-Al3Ti composites fabricated by FSP are: (1) the fine grain size of the Al
matrix, and (2) the Orowan strengthening due to the fine dispersion of large amount of Al3Ti
particles.
To estimate the contribution of Orowan strengthening by Al3Ti particles, it is assumed that the
Al3Ti particles are spherical and uniformly distributed. The interparticle spacing, , of Al3Ti
particles can be calculated from [46]

strengthening to tensile strength can be calculated as OR = MOR, where Mis Taylor factor and M 
= 3 for FCC polycrystal. Based upon the microstructural parameters listed in Table 5 and 6, the
contributions of grain size strengthening and Orowan strengthening to yield strength are calculated.
As shown in Table 8, the high strength of these FS processed Al-Ti alloys can be mainly attributed
to (1) the grain size strengthening (gs) which results from the ultrafine aluminum grain size, and (2)
the Orowan strengthening (OR) which is a result of the presence of large volume fraction of
nanometer sized Al3Ti particles.
Al-Cu system
(1) Orowan strengthening.
Al-Al2Cu composites produced by FSP have lower yield strength as compared to the Al-Al3Ti
composites.
6. The Young’s modulus of these composites increases significantly with increasing volume
fraction of reinforcement particles. The measured Young’s moduli of these composites agree
well with the prediction of Halpin-Tsai equation.
7. For Al-Al2Cu composites, the composite modulus increases ~0.5 GPa for every 1 vol.% second
phase particles. Because Al3Ti has higher modulus, the modulus of Al-Al3Ti composites
increases ~1 GPa for every 1 vol.% Al3Ti. For Al-15Ti, the Young’s modulus of FSP produced
Al-Al3Ti composites can reach 114 GPa, which is 63% higher than that of aluminum.
8. The compressive yield strength is higher than the tensile strength for these composites. This
strength difference may be attributed to the presence of tensile residual stress in the aluminum
matrix of these composites as a result of differential thermal contraction between aluminum and
the reinforcement during cooling down from the processing temperature.
