I?Abstract 
 
The purposes of this project are to study the cultivation conditions of soybean sprouts and to 
investigate efficacy of different methods for eliminating microorganism contaminations of 
soybean sprouts using NaOCl, electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW), electrolyzed reducing water 
(ERW) and hypochlorite soft acid water (HSW).  
Results indicated that growth curves of soybean sprout could be well-fitted with Gompertz 
models. Sprouts cultivated with tap water yielded larger harvest index, maximum growth rate and 
final size of hypocotyl length than those cultivated with EOW, ERW or HSW. Spraying with 10 
ppm ethephon solution on the sprouts once a day did not had significant effect on growth rate and 
final size of the sprouts probably due to the spraying times of the ethephon and the cultivation 
water . Sprouts cultivated at 25 ? yielded larger sprouts than those at 22 ?. 
Microorganism contamination of soybean sprouts during cultivation was investigated. 
Results indicated no Escherichia coli was found in the sprouts. Viable cell count increased 
quickly from the starting seed to the 24th hour of cultivation and then increase slowly till the 168th 
hour of the harvest time of the sprouts. The growth curve followed a Rectangular hyperbola 
model (p < 0.001). Analyses done on yeast and mold indicated that mold is the predominant 
microorganism of the two. A maximum increase on number of mold appeared at the 117th hour of 
the cultivation period. The growth curve followed a Gompertz model (p < 0.001).  
Various protocols had been tested for efficacies of different disinfection methods on the 
harvest soybean sprouts. 50 ppm and 100 ppm of EOW and HSW solutions, respectively, 
significantly (p < 0.01) decreased 58% ~81% of the viable cell counts on the sprouts. Results 
indicated that 100 ppm of EOW and HSW solutions significantly (p < 0.01) reduced 81% of the 
viable cells on the sprouts after the sprouts were subjected to a three-minutes of 45 ? 
heat-shock treatment. Results indicated that chilling the disinfectants to 5 ? before applying to 
the sprouts reduced from 51 % to 71% of the viable cell count on the sprouts

temperature (0.58 mm/hr, 1.30 mm/hr, and 1.78 mm/hr, respectively). Spraying with 10 ppm 
ethephon solution on the sprouts once a day reduced maximum growth rate and final size of the 
sprouts (i.e. from 2.08 mm/hr to 1.73 mm/hr and from 200 mm to 178 mm, respectively) but the 
differences did not reach a statistical significant levels (p < 0.05) probably due to large variation 
in sampling.  
Microorganism contamination of soybean sprouts during cultivation had been investigated. 
Results indicated that Escherichia coli was not found in the sprouts. Viable cell count 
significantly increased from the starting seed to the 24th hour of the cultivation period and then 
increase slowly till the 168th hour of the harvest time of the sprouts. The growth curve can be 
well-fitted by a Rectangular hyperbola model (p < 0.001). Analyses done on yeast and mold 
indicated that mold is the predominant microorganism of the two. The growth curve followed a 
Gompertz model (p < 0.001). The average initial and final viable yeast and mold counts were 
2.89 and 4.47 log10 CFU/g respectively. Maximum growth rate of the yeast and mold was 0.013 
log10 CFU/hr, which appeared at the 117th hour during the cultivation period. Comparing to the 
7.89 log10 CFU/g of average viable cell count, the number of yeast and mold is small. In addition 
to the above analyses, 12 soybean sprout samples had been purchased from local market places 
and were tested for the viable cell counts on the sprouts. Results indicated that the average viable 
cell count was 7.57 ? 0.32 log10 CFU/g. 
In the second part of the study, 1 ppm of electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW), electrolyzed 
reducing water (ERW) and hypochlorite soft acid water (HSW), respectively, were used to 
cultivate soybean sprouts. Results indicated that EOW, ERW and HSW all significantly decreased 
hypocotyl length and total length of the final sprouts and the sizes of the sprouts at the maximum 
growth rate. The final hypocotyl length and the maximum-rate hypocotyl length of the 
HSW-cultivated sprouts decreased from 133 mm to 84 mm and from 79 mm to 47 mm, 
respectively. The final total length and the maximum-rate total length of the HSW-cultivated 
sprouts decreased from 217 mm to 161 mm and from 130 mm to 97 mm, respectively. The final 
hypocotyl length and the maximum-rate hypocotyl lengths of the EOW-cultivated and the 
ERW-cultivated sprouts decreased from 161 mm to 77 mm and 84 mm respectively, and from 99 
mm to 48 mm and 53 mm, respectively. The final total length and the maximum-rate total lengths 
of the EOW-cultivated and the ERW-cultivated sprouts decreased from 314 mm to 141 mm and 
175 mm respectively, and from 196 mm to 94 mm and 110 mm, respectively. ERW did not 
promote growth of the sprouts as expected. However, concentration other than 1 ppm many have 
different effect. 
In the third part of the study, various protocols were designed to compare efficacies of many 
disinfecting methods on the harvest soybean sprouts. Results of a comparison on 50 ppm and 100 
ppm of EOW and HSW solutions indicated that washing and soaking with these disinfectants at 
the tested concentrations significantly (p < 0.001) decreased 58% ~81% of the viable cell counts 
on the sprouts. Another comparison had been done on the effects of 100 ppm of NaClO, EOW 
and HSW solutions on soybean sprouts after the sprouts were subjected to a three-minutes of 45 
? heat-shock treatment. Results indicated that EOW and HSW significantly (p < 0.001) reduce 
81% and 81%, respectively, of the viable cells on the sprouts. Another comparison on 100 ppm of
