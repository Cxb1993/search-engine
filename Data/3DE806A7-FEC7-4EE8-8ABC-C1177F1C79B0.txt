1.  Introduction 
Green issues are gaining importance and interest among practitioners and researchers in operations and supply 
chain management (SCM). Economics, environmental regulations and customer pressure are critical drivers in green 
SCM worldwide. Products with short expected life cycles are important sources of enterprise profits. Such products 
include high-fashioned and new technological products. With the advent of new information-technology application 
(ITA), enterprises have engaged in supply chain process improvements across organizations. Due to environmental 
consciousness, smart usages of resources in supply chain process are becoming more essential. Green supply chain 
(GSC) and system collaboration decisions with the enhancement of information technologies have become the current 
issues faced by organizations with strong internal and external linkages. GSC integrates sound environmental design 
choices for the conversion of resources into usable products. Moreover, inventory may deplete due to various 
conditions, such as the nature of product, design capability of design groups, design request level of customers, 
production or storage environment, and so on. Therefore, with different production-distribution planning, the 
concept of product design for green activities and remanufacturing should be considered in the trade-off issues 
of remanufacturing cost, investment in information technology and forward manufacturing costs.    
The goal of this paper is to develop a production-inventory-distribution model considering product-design value, 
the new technology evolution, ITA investment, remanufacturing and business process improvement. The optimal 
production inventory system with a stationary demand is developed to understand the importance of related factors in 
the policy and to find the influence of cost components in a green supply chain. 
1.1. Deteriorating model 
Due to deterioration, controlling and maintaining inventories of deteriorating items become an important problem 
for decision makers in modern organization. Ghare and Schrader (1963) were the first authors to consider an on-going 
deterioration of inventory. Other authors such as Covert and Philip (1973) and Raafat et al. (1991) assumed different 
production policy with different assumptions on the patterns of deterioration. Moon et al. (2005) developed various 
models for ameliorating and deteriorating items with time varying demand pattern, taking into account the effects of 
inflation and time value of money. Chung and Wee (2007) showed that the unit inspection cost significantly influences 
the delivery frequency in production-inventory deteriorating model. Lo et al. (2007) developed an deteriorating 
inventory model taking time value into consideration. Wee et al. (2007) derived an optimal solution for deteriorating 
product with imperfect item.  
1.2. Green-product-design value 
Numerous countries are developing incentive programs and waste handling regulations at all levels to persuade 
alternative disposition of electronic waste and such policies force the manufacturer and the consumer to have greater 
responsibility for the safe disposition of their components and products (Callahan et al., 1997; Boks et al., 1998). 
Klausne and Wolfgang (1999) outlined a concept for integrating product repair and product take-back. They showed 
that remanufactured and reconditioned product would result in a higher service level in both product take-back and 
product repair for a range of electronic products. Researches on remanufacturing and recovery of product indicated that 
the green supply chain value added could be achieved through managing product returns in a more cost effective 
manner (Min et al., 2006), through a new developed business model (Mont et al, 2006) and through the evolution of 
the customer into their computer system of demand-inventory management. Through ITA, the buyer cooperates with 
the supplier to make a periodic JIT delivery to their own warehouse. Simultaneously, the supplier accomplishes the 
direct shipment to the buyer’s customer. The system diminishes the negative environmental impacts through green 
operations design. The remanufacturing processes begin from cleaning and sorting distribution. An amount of 
product entering the remanufacturing process is collected from the users and is proportional to the production 
lot size Q (with a ratio of ξ). After collection, sorting and disassembly procedure, a ratio, RS, of the collected 
items is to be salvaged and a ratio, (1-RS), of the collected items is to be remanufactured and reused (The upper 
section of Figure 2).  
Assumptions 
Although there are many factors influencing the operation in real world, for modeling simplicity, the 
following assumptions are used in the development of the proposed production-inventory model: 
 (a) Instead of uncertainty consideration of supply and demand, the supplier ’s production rate and demand 
rate are independent of the production lot size and are constant. Production rate is greater than demand 
rate. 
 (b) Shortages are not allowed for the supplier and the buyer. 
 (c) For modeling simplicity, the model does not consider defective items. 
 (d) The deteriorating items are identified and disposed of immediately without replacement.   
 (e) The lead time is known and constant.    
(f) The players have complete operations information of each other.  
(g) The number of the supplier ’s shipment is an integer number. 
(h) A single item with a constant rate of deterioration   is considered. 
(i) For modeling simplicity, deterioration of the units is considered only after they have been received into 
the inventory. 
(j) All costs are assumed to be non-decreasing as stock moves down the supply chain. Since the buyer 
incurs more cost in unit purchase cost, hence the holding cost is Hb ≥ HS and Cdb ≥ UiS .

2.2. Model development 
We derive the total cost of an integrated production-inventory-distribution model considering the relevant costs 
with information technology investment when implementing direct shipment and JIT delivery (Figure 1). The model 
assumes that a successive batch arrives at the store as soon as the previous batch has been depleted.The differential

Green-product-design value 
The supplier’s product design cost,  TY , is a function of T , where T  is the product life-cycle. Although 
there are many parameters influencing the design cost and production cost of a product, from the product-design life 
point of view, it is appropriate to take it as a function increasing with product life-cycle. The supplier’s product design 
cost is

where jR  is the reliability of subcomponent j. For simplifying the analysis, we assume that there are two major parts 
for the component in which 1R  is the reliability of power supply and 2R  is the reliability of subcomponent 2 
consisting of some parallel sub-functions. For the first term, we assume that the design cost increases and is 
proportional to the degree of implementing ITA, Ep.

We assume that the component has an exponential recondition distribution with a mean of m1 . For the 
competitive and time-to-market driven industry, the development cycle at the electrical product company is based on a 
significant amount of reusable technology. We assume that the mean time between technological evolutions is in 
exponential pattern. The supplier’s total remanufacturing cost consists of cleaning, disassembling, remanufacturing and 
convertibility cost. The supplier’s remanufacturing cost per unit time can be derived as

[Insert Figure 5 about here] 
Using the fast solution procedure in section 3, the optimal solution considering deterioration is derived as 
*)*,*,*,*,*,( TCKYQTN b = (6 times, 0.0794 years, 2477 units, 0.8640, $16,379.24, $152,229.95), respectively. If 
deterioration approximates to zero, the solution is derived as in Table 2. The percentage of total cost difference is used 
to analyze the sensitivity analysis of the input parameters, defined as, 
*/*)( TCTCTCPTCD  . 
When the parameters value change, then the relationships among the known parameters, the decision variable and 
the percentage integrated total cost difference are derived. The main conclusions drawn from the sensitivity analysis are 
as follows: 
(a) When the deterioration rate θ and the green handling ratio of reusable and take-back items  increase, the 
delivery time interval Tb decreases. In practice, when the deteriorating rate θ increases and the more reusable 
products are taken back, the delivery time interval Tb should be shortened, i.e., policy with more frequent 
deliveries may be implemented (Table 2 and Table 4).  
(b) When the convertibility parameter C and green handling ratio  increase, the total cost tends to decrease. 
The new technologies evolve frequently and the take-back items increase will benefit the green supply chain 
controlling recovery rate in the green production and remanufacturing processes.
