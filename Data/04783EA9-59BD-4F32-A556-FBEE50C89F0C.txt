Abstract 
The main focus of the technical project report is to investigate the newly discovered 
mix-mode (MM) conducted EMI emissions even further and use new understandings to 
improve practical EMI filter designs. First of all, the high-accuracy Noise Emission Divider 
for EMI noise measurements is to be designed and constructed. It is an important electronic 
device for diagnosis and analysis of conducted EMI emissions. In addition, coupling and 
suppression mechanisms of the MM EMI are to be studied; especially for the effect of the 
recently found MM EMI on a boost-type power factor corrected (PFC) pulse-width 
modulated (PWM) rectifier. Practical PFC EMI filter design method with the consideration 
of MM emissions is given. The proposed method can be easily implemented in 
commercially available EMI filter by means of the differential-mode (DM) base-line noise 
emission measurement with a MM emission current-dividing capacitor. Incorporation of 
MM EMI considerations in a filter design of the PFC stage could be a better choice from the 
filter size reduction, high power density and high efficiency of the whole system points of 
view. Design examples are presented and experiments are carried out to verify the analysis. 
Based on the theory of MM EMI emissions, the effects of the boost PFC inductor on EMI 
filter effectiveness are then studied along with experimental verifications. 
 
Keywords: power factor correction (PFC), electromagnetic interference (EMI), mix-mode 
(MM), boost converter, filter design.

然而對於包含前置功率因數修正電路以升壓型轉換器為例（Power Factor 
Correction Boost Rectifier）而言，橋式整流器（Bridge Diode Rectifiers）應皆處於一對
二極體總是導通狀態於輸入電源正半週期，而另一對二極體總是處於導通狀態於輸入
電源負半週期。基於此以混模雜訊理論而言，理應無混模雜訊現象存在於功因修正電
路中，但於實驗結果發現，於輸入端橋式整流器切換瞬間，仍有短暫時間混模雜訊存
在之可能性產生。因此混模雜訊之現象仍不容忽視（尤其於濾波器設計考量方面）。

4.1、電磁干擾濾波器之實務設計考量和實驗驗證（I） 
依據所提出的考量混模雜訊效應之濾波器設計步驟，分別以實驗驗證提出一組未
考量混模雜訊之設計範例 A（傳統之設計考量），以及兩組考量混模雜訊之設計範例
B 和範例 C（包含新型混模雜訊效應之設計）並做比較，三組之各別總雜訊實驗結果
可分別由 Fig.17～Fig.19 觀察得到。由實驗結果可驗證，所提出的包含混模雜訊效應
之電磁干擾濾波器，確能有效達到減少濾波器體積、降低產品生產成本、有利於達成
濾波器設計最佳化等之目的。 
（1）未包含混模雜訊效應之傳統濾波器設計： 
依據傳統設計法則所量測得到之DM與CM之Corner Frequencies：fR,DM為47 kHz、
fR,CM為 62 kHz，則根據傳統濾波器設計流程可以獲得濾波器設計值如下所示： 
設計範例 A（傳統設計）：Cx＝0.1μF、LD＝58μH、Cy＝3300pF 及 LC＝1mH；實
驗結果則如 Fig.17 所示。 
（2）考量新型混模雜訊效應所提出之濾波器設計： 
依據考量新型混模雜訊效應之濾波器設計法則，所量測得到之DM與CM之Corner 
Frequencies：fR,DM為 61 kHz、fR,CM為 62 kHz，因此根據所提出之濾波器設計流程可以
獲得濾波器設計值如下所示： 
設計範例 B（新型設計）：Cx＝0.1μF、LD＝34μH、Cy＝3300pF 及 LC＝1mH；實
驗結果則如 Fig.18 所示。 
設計範例 C（新型設計）：Cx＝59nF、LD＝58μH、Cy＝3300pF 及 LC＝1mH；實
驗結果則如 Fig.19 所示。 
 
24 
 
 
由 The total EMI emission measurements 量測結果實驗 Fig.17～Fig.19 可知，所提出
之考量新型混模雜訊效應之濾波器設計法則，將可有效達成精簡濾波器元計體積、減
少生產成本，也能達成有效抑制 EMI 雜訊之目的；本計畫所提出之 EMI 濾波器實務
設計流程，將可適用於實際的電力電子 EMI 濾波器設計考量以及產品商業化的應用
中。 
 
4.2、電磁干擾濾波器之實務設計考量和實驗驗證（II） 
另一組實務驗證也為依據所提出的考量混模雜訊效應之濾波器設計步驟，分別以
實驗驗證提出一組未考量混模雜訊之設計範例 A，以及兩組考量混模雜訊之設計範例
B 和設計範例 C 並做比較，三組之各別總雜訊實驗結果可分別由 Fig.20 觀察得到。由
實驗結果可驗證，所提出的包含新型混模雜訊效應之電磁干擾濾波器，確能有效達到
減少濾波器體積、降低產品生產成本、有利於達成濾波器設計最佳化等之目的。 
（1）未包含混模雜訊效應之傳統濾波器設計： 
設計範例 A：Cx＝0.47μF、LD＝33.2μH（選用 LD＝34.5μH） 
（2）考量新型混模雜訊效應所提出之濾波器設計： 
設計範例 B：Cx＝0.47μF、LD＝11.5μH（選用 LD＝12.5μH） 
設計範例 C：Cx＝0.162μF（選用 0.22μF），LD＝33.2μH（34.5μH）

II.  DESCRIPTION OF THE MIX-MODE EMI NOISE 
EMISSIONS IN PFC PWM RECTIFIERS
MM EMI noise current, which flows out through the 
line or neutral conductors and returns on the earth ground 
(the imbalance behavior of the noise current flowing 
through a LISN), in reality, is the part of DM EMI 
measured during the time interval of all four diodes of the 
bridge rectifier are traditionally thought to be turned off. 
In a SMPS system with a front-end PFC rectifier, the 
rectifier diodes conduct continuously; namely, there may 
be no time interval where all four diodes of the bridge 
rectifier work in reverse bias. There should not be any 
MM EMI emission current flowing into a LISN; therefore, 
the MM EMI should contribute nothing to EMI 
prediction in theory and have negligible effects on EMI 
measurement in practice. 
However, it should be pointed out that there exists a 
conduction dead angle that occurs around the zero 
crossings of the input line ac voltage and current 
waveforms of the PFC pre-regulator. It can be clearly 
seen that the discontinuous behavior of the measured ac 
line current occurs at the zero crossing of the ac line 
voltage shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, contrary to traditional 
reasoning, not all four diodes of the diode bridge rectifier 
are actually turned off as traditionally thought. One diode 
of the bridge rectifier actually conducts noise frequency 
EMI current emissions through parasitic elements of the 
power circuit and then produces the MM EMI. Since this 
occurs near the zero crossings of the ac line waveforms, 
the MM EMI is generated. In order to observe the MM 
and the DM noise emissions individually, the “zero span” 
mode of a spectrum analyzer should be used to measure 
both the MM and the DM in the course of considering the 
time-domain waveforms of the DM noise at the preferred 
frequency shown in Fig. 1. It should be pointed out that 
the “zero span” is the only one method of providing 
derived knowledge regarding the obtained EMI. Let us 
(somewhat arbitrarily) choose the frequency 150 kHz to 
see for the time-domain waveform of the DM noise. In 
this figure, one is a pair of the diode bridge rectifier 
conduction interval and the other is the interval when 
only one bridge diode conducts at the ac line zero 
crossing. Fig. 2 shows the paths of the noise current flow 
of the MM EMI emissions during the input power line ac 
voltage polarity is as shown. A boost-type low harmonic 
power rectifier is used for illustrating the generation 
manner of the MM EMI emissions. In this figure, one can 
see the MM noise emission current flows through one of 
the LISN resistor. The noise propagation process is quite 
different from those of a pair of the diode bridge rectifier 
conducts input power currents. 
III.  METHOD FOR PFC RECTIFIER EMI FILTER DESIGN 
INCORPORATING THE PHENOMENON OF MIX-MODE 
EMISSIONS
In the following, a general step by step PFC EMI filter 
design method will be presented with practical design 
examples. Based on the method given, the test setup for 
conducted EMI measurements including: a spectrum 
analyzer, a two channel LISN, a noise separator [2, 3] and 
a MM noise emission current-dividing (balancing) 
capacitor (namely, Ccd or Cb) are required, so that the 
magnitude of all modes of noise can be recognized. 
Firstly, the PFC rectifier base line DM EMI noise with a 
current-dividing capacitor, and the base line CM EMI 
noise without this capacitor, by using a noise separator 
should be measured separately. The filter attenuation 
conditions and the corner frequencies (filter network 
resonant frequencies) of both DM and CM sections 
should be determined. According to the design 
information received, the filter component values can be 
derived for the case of PFC EMI filters. 
Based on the proposed method, several practical 
design examples are given as follows. PFC rectifier EMI 
filters are designed using the proposed method 
incorporating the effects of MM noise emissions. Filters 
are designed for a typical boost-type PFC power 
converter operates in the current control based on the 
critical conduction mode of variable switching frequency. 
This converter operates with an input ac voltage of 110 V 
at 60 Hz, a full-load output power of 80 W, and a well-
regulated dc voltage of 400 V. The limit is the FCC Class 
B conducted emission regulation. In the following, a step 
by step design method will be given with experimental 
supports.

C.  Define Filter Component Values 
The values of both the DM and the CM components 
can be determined by corner frequencies given in Section 
III-B. The schematic of both a LISN and a typical EMI 
filter is drawn in Fig. 5. For determining the component 
values of DM filter section: LD, Cx1 and Cx2, an equation 
shown in (2) can be written in terms of the corner 
frequency deduced from LD and any of the X capacitors 
(Cx1 or Cx2). In the given design method of a PFC EMI 
filter, the values of both X capacitors are supposed to be 
equal to each other. Actually, the two X capacitors can be 
obtained for different values; the effects of both the Cx1
and the Cx2 on filter design considerations will be 
discussed later. 
Cx = (1/2ʌ fR,DM)2 (1/2LD).          (2) 
For determining the component values of CM filter 
section: LC and Cy, an equation shown in (3) can be 
characterized in terms of the corner frequency derived 
from LC and Cy. Generally speaking, in order to satisfy 
the safety requirement of the earth leakage current, the 
value of EMI filter Y capacitor is no more than 3300 pF 
can be utilized. 
LC = (1/2ʌ fR,CM)2 (1/2Cy)          (3) 
IV.  DESIGN EXAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL 
VERIFICATIONS
A design example (design A) obtained by the 
traditional method is given. For comparison, two design 
examples (designs B and C) of PFC rectifier EMI filters 
are built to validate the proposed methods. All of the 
filter design examples were presented with experiments 
to verify the analysis.

A.  A traditional filter design without the MM EMI 
considerations 
For the given corner frequencies fR,DM of 47 kHz and 
fR,CM of 62 kHz obtained in Section III-B, one set of 
design is carried out below: 
    1)  Design Example A (traditional design): Cx1 = Cx2 = 
0.1 ȝF, LD = 58 ȝH, Cy = 3300 pF and LC = 1 mH. 
Experimental result of the design A is presented in Fig. 6. 
B.  Two proposed filter designs with the MM EMI 
considerations 
From (3), the maximum component value of Cy is 
chosen to be 3300 pF for leakage current limitation. Thus, 
the LC value can be calculated to be 1 mH. From (2), 
there is a design tradeoff in selection of DM component 
values, Cx and LD. For the given corner frequencies fR,DM
of 61 kHz and fR,CM of 62 kHz obtained in Section III-B, 
two sets of design are therefore given below: 
    1)  Design Example B (proposed design): Cx1 = Cx2 = 
0.1 ȝF, LD = 34 ȝH, Cy = 3300 pF and LC = 1 mH. 
Experimental result of the design B is presented in Fig. 7. 
    2)  Design Example C (proposed design): Cx1 = Cx2 = 
59 nF, LD = 58 ȝH, Cy = 3300 pF and LC = 1 mH. 
Experimental result of the design C is presented in Fig. 8. 
Fig. 6.  Total EMI emissions measured for the design A. The limit is the

to 30 MHz.

The 2010 International Power Electronics Conference
FCC Class B conducted emission requirement. It is 
confirmed that the proposed design method involves 
considering the MM EMI effects so that the filter size 
reduction is achieved. The proposed theory can be easily 
adapted to practical applications in the design of PFC 
EMI filters, from measuring EMI noise emissions of 
power circuits, to quickly and systematically performing 
filter design. Finally, the effects of the boost-type PFC 
input inductor on the EMI filter performance are carried 
out, along with experimental verifications. The theory 
proposed in this paper could be sufficient for qualitative 
understanding of the input EMI filter design of a low 
harmonic rectifier system based on the boost converter.

Fig.3 (a) typical characteristic of power LED and (b) that of driver MOSFET  
 
Equation (3) shows the sink current Io is almost constant if Rs 
is a qualified resistor and is proportional to the input voltage 
v+. Fig. 3(a) is the typical characteristic of the power LED, 
whose forward current id is function of vd varying in 
exponential form. It is clearly shown that id goes up when vd 
increases and vice versa. In short, any change of forward 
voltage vd on LED will cause id change. In reality, the sink 
current Io through the string LEDs in Fig. 2(a) is determined 
by CCSK. If Io goes up from Il to Im for example, the LED 
voltage vd will then increase from Vl to Vm, the incremental 
voltage in the string loop is that composed of the string LED 
forward voltages and the voltage drop on the sense resistor Rs. 
The resulted incremental voltage will then reduce the vds of 
MOSFET with a constant voltage Vdc from CVS, which may 
push the sink MOSFET into triode region possibly making 
sink current Io inconstant compared with the previous state. 
Fig. 3(b) is the characteristic of a typical MOSFET, in which 
the drain current ids is almost constant in the saturation region, 
but collapse in the triode region. Moving along curve biased 
by vgs2, the drain current ids at points k and q in the saturation 
region are almost constant, i.e., Ik=Ip. When moving into the 
triode region such as at point p, the current ids is getting low 
and not constant. More importantly, in this case since the vds 
of MOSFET is getting small, the sink MOSFET would not 
have enough tolerance room for absorbing the voltage rise on 
the string loop to maintain sink current constant. Accordingly, 
the reduction of vds following the increase of Io may lead sink 
MOSFET entering the triode region, which certainly limits 
the increasing of sink current in CCSK and restricts the 
luminous output from LEDs. However, the operating point of 
MOSFET is often determined by empirical-oriented approach 
in usual application. If the operation point is placed at such as 
point q or far from triode region in Fig. 3(b), the current ids is 
quite constant but dealing with heat dissipation on the sink 
MOSFET and sense resistor will be a significant issue, 
especially in high luminous output. 
 
III. LDCVR WITH CCSK FOR MULTI-LEDS DRIVES 
The proposed LDCVR for building a low-dropout vds of 
the sink MOSFET realize the properly making luminous 
output of the string LEDs in CCSK during a wide dimming 
range as explored in Fig. 4. The LDCVR is simply a buck 
converter, with control referred to a low-dropout detector 
(LDD) from the sink MOFET, consisting of a differential 
amplifier A2 and an error amplifier A3. Only one of the 
parallel CCSKs, namely master current sink, is selected as 
detection reference. The rest of slave CCSKs are also 
supplied from the LDCVR and reference to the dimmer 
control to gain almost balance string currents each other due 
to well current mirror existing between gm amplifiers. The 
LDD is designed to monitor the vds of MOSFET from the 
master CCSK not over or below a specified voltage vref2 to 
maintain the MOSFET working in the saturation region but 
not far from the triode region. A buck converter with varying 
its reference vref3 at error amplifier A4 achieves a variable 
voltage source (VVS) to realize the proposed control theme 
master CCSK, a low-dropout detector (LDD) and a buck 
converter, but not showing the four slave CCSKs. A LED 
display panel fulfilling a 5 parallel strings with each string of 3 
LEDs (5×3 LEDs) is involved in this example. All CCSKs are 
survived at the dimmer reference Vref1 for providing equal 
current in each string with reference to the master CCSK. In 
this design, there are total of 15 power LEDs in the display 
panel consisting of 5 parallel strings with each string of 3 
LEDs in series.

Predicted power loss in MOSFET at low-dropout voltage 1.5V 
 
V. DESIGN AND EXPERIMENT 
The LDD in Fig. 7 consists of operational amplifiers 
(OPAs) A2 and A3, in which the differential amplifier A2 
manipulates the low-dropout voltage detection at vds of Q1 
and the error amplifier A3 compares the output voltage with a 
specified reference Vref2, where Vref2 is the desired low-
dropout voltage, say 1.5V for example. A junction FET 
(JFET) dictated by Vea2 of A3 is designed to provide its 
intrinsic resistance parallel with R1 to determine the desired 
output voltage Vdc of LDCVR. After finishing the LDD 
detection and the achieved reference Vref3, the LDCVR is built 
with the dictated PWM control formed by an error amplifier 
A4 and a PWM comparator A5. In this design, a quad 
operation amplifier HA17324 is used to handle the control of 
LDCVR in master stage. 
 
Fig. 6 Realization circuit of the proposed LDCVR 
 
The master CCSK and the four slaves are implemented by 
two quad OPAs, in which the four slave CCSKs are linked 
following the master control and supplied from the LDCVR 
to achieve current balance between the five parallel LEDs 
strings. In Fig. 7, the sink current Io responsible for the 
dimming range is specified from 20mA to 260mA. With 
suitable arrangement of the load lines under the specified Io 
and low-dropout vds=1.5V, the current sensor Rs can be 
graphically given in Fig. 5 with equation (5). If we take 
medium Io=140mA as reference and letting Vdc=14V, 
Vd=2.85V, vds=1.5V, and Vdd=14-3×2.85=5.45V, the Rs=28Ω 
is then given. The LDD is easily implemented by two of quad 
operation amplifier HA17324 with reference vref2=-1.5V. The 
JFET Q3 driven by the output of A3 can then provide 
intrinsic resistance from 1.22kΩ to 2.927kΩ corresponding to 
LDCVR output ranged from 10V to 16V. The output voltage 
Vdc of LDCVR is mainly determined by the intrinsic 
resistance of JFET Q3 commanded from LDD. A 50W buck 
converter with variable output voltage ranged from 9V to 
18V is achieved to supply 5 parallel strings of LEDs, in 
which each string will dissipate maximum power about 
2.34W at Io=260mA and output maximum luminous flux of 
53.8 kcd/m2. Experiment shows that the output voltage Vdc of 
LDCVR in Fig. 8a adaptively following the voltage change 
on string LEDs under Io change, which is close to the 
predicted estimation in Fig. 7a. Comparing with Fig. 7b, Fig. 
8b shows the low dropout voltage vds is around the specified 
1.5V quite the same as the estimation during a wide sink 
current Io. Remarkably, the sink current Io can be controlled 
by an available vgs. The conduction loss of the sink MOSFET 
in Fig. 8c is kept not over 380mW at maximum sink current 
Io=260mA, which meets the predicted estimation. The 
Luminous output corresponding to sink current Io and Vdc of 
LDCVR with respect to dimmer reference Vref1 (dimmer 
voltage) is shown in Fig. 9, which accordingly outputs 
luminance varying from 5.3 kcd/m2 to 53.8 kcd/m2 at a 
measure distance of 50cm. 
The experimental result also shows well performance of 
LEDs with normal luminous output during wide sink current

II.  DESCRIPTION OF THE MIX-MODE EMI NOISE 
EMISSIONS IN PFC PWM RECTIFIERS
MM EMI noise current, which flows out through the 
line or neutral conductors and returns on the earth ground 
(the imbalance behavior of the noise current flowing 
through a LISN), in reality, is the part of DM EMI 
measured during the time interval of all four diodes of the 
bridge rectifier are traditionally thought to be turned off. 
In a SMPS system with a front-end PFC rectifier, the 
rectifier diodes conduct continuously; namely, there may 
be no time interval where all four diodes of the bridge 
rectifier work in reverse bias. There should not be any 
MM EMI emission current flowing into a LISN; therefore, 
the MM EMI should contribute nothing to EMI 
prediction in theory and have negligible effects on EMI 
measurement in practice. 
However, it should be pointed out that there exists a 
conduction dead angle that occurs around the zero 
crossings of the input line ac voltage and current 
waveforms of the PFC pre-regulator. It can be clearly 
seen that the discontinuous behavior of the measured ac 
line current occurs at the zero crossing of the ac line 
voltage shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, contrary to traditional 
reasoning, not all four diodes of the diode bridge rectifier 
are actually turned off as traditionally thought. One diode 
of the bridge rectifier actually conducts noise frequency 
EMI current emissions through parasitic elements of the 
power circuit and then produces the MM EMI. Since this 
occurs near the zero crossings of the ac line waveforms, 
the MM EMI is generated. In order to observe the MM 
and the DM noise emissions individually, the “zero span” 
mode of a spectrum analyzer should be used to measure 
both the MM and the DM in the course of considering the 
time-domain waveforms of the DM noise at the preferred 
frequency shown in Fig. 1. It should be pointed out that 
the “zero span” is the only one method of providing 
derived knowledge regarding the obtained EMI. Let us 
(somewhat arbitrarily) choose the frequency 150 kHz to 
see for the time-domain waveform of the DM noise. In 
this figure, one is a pair of the diode bridge rectifier 
conduction interval and the other is the interval when 
only one bridge diode conducts at the ac line zero 
crossing. Fig. 2 shows the paths of the noise current flow 
of the MM EMI emissions during the input power line ac 
voltage polarity is as shown. A boost-type low harmonic 
power rectifier is used for illustrating the generation 
manner of the MM EMI emissions. In this figure, one can 
see the MM noise emission current flows through one of 
the LISN resistor. The noise propagation process is quite 
different from those of a pair of the diode bridge rectifier 
conducts input power currents. 
III.  METHOD FOR PFC RECTIFIER EMI FILTER DESIGN 
INCORPORATING THE PHENOMENON OF MIX-MODE 
EMISSIONS
In the following, a general step by step PFC EMI filter 
design method will be presented with practical design 
examples. Based on the method given, the test setup for 
conducted EMI measurements including: a spectrum 
analyzer, a two channel LISN, a noise separator [2, 3] and 
a MM noise emission current-dividing (balancing) 
capacitor (namely, Ccd or Cb) are required, so that the 
magnitude of all modes of noise can be recognized. 
Firstly, the PFC rectifier base line DM EMI noise with a 
current-dividing capacitor, and the base line CM EMI 
noise without this capacitor, by using a noise separator 
should be measured separately. The filter attenuation 
conditions and the corner frequencies (filter network 
resonant frequencies) of both DM and CM sections 
should be determined. According to the design 
information received, the filter component values can be 
derived for the case of PFC EMI filters. 
Based on the proposed method, several practical 
design examples are given as follows. PFC rectifier EMI 
filters are designed using the proposed method 
incorporating the effects of MM noise emissions. Filters 
are designed for a typical boost-type PFC power 
converter operates in the current control based on the 
critical conduction mode of variable switching frequency. 
This converter operates with an input ac voltage of 110 V 
at 60 Hz, a full-load output power of 80 W, and a well-
regulated dc voltage of 400 V. The limit is the FCC Class 
B conducted emission regulation. In the following, a step 
by step design method will be given with experimental 
supports.

C.  Define Filter Component Values 
The values of both the DM and the CM components 
can be determined by corner frequencies given in Section 
III-B. The schematic of both a LISN and a typical EMI 
filter is drawn in Fig. 5. For determining the component 
values of DM filter section: LD, Cx1 and Cx2, an equation 
shown in (2) can be written in terms of the corner 
frequency deduced from LD and any of the X capacitors 
(Cx1 or Cx2). In the given design method of a PFC EMI 
filter, the values of both X capacitors are supposed to be 
equal to each other. Actually, the two X capacitors can be 
obtained for different values; the effects of both the Cx1
and the Cx2 on filter design considerations will be 
discussed later. 
Cx = (1/2ʌ fR,DM)2 (1/2LD).          (2) 
For determining the component values of CM filter 
section: LC and Cy, an equation shown in (3) can be 
characterized in terms of the corner frequency derived 
from LC and Cy. Generally speaking, in order to satisfy 
the safety requirement of the earth leakage current, the 
value of EMI filter Y capacitor is no more than 3300 pF 
can be utilized. 
LC = (1/2ʌ fR,CM)2 (1/2Cy)          (3) 
IV.  DESIGN EXAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL 
VERIFICATIONS
A design example (design A) obtained by the 
traditional method is given. For comparison, two design 
examples (designs B and C) of PFC rectifier EMI filters 
are built to validate the proposed methods. All of the 
filter design examples were presented with experiments 
to verify the analysis.

A.  A traditional filter design without the MM EMI 
considerations 
For the given corner frequencies fR,DM of 47 kHz and 
fR,CM of 62 kHz obtained in Section III-B, one set of 
design is carried out below: 
    1)  Design Example A (traditional design): Cx1 = Cx2 = 
0.1 ȝF, LD = 58 ȝH, Cy = 3300 pF and LC = 1 mH. 
Experimental result of the design A is presented in Fig. 6. 
B.  Two proposed filter designs with the MM EMI 
considerations 
From (3), the maximum component value of Cy is 
chosen to be 3300 pF for leakage current limitation. Thus, 
the LC value can be calculated to be 1 mH. From (2), 
there is a design tradeoff in selection of DM component 
values, Cx and LD. For the given corner frequencies fR,DM
of 61 kHz and fR,CM of 62 kHz obtained in Section III-B, 
two sets of design are therefore given below: 
    1)  Design Example B (proposed design): Cx1 = Cx2 = 
0.1 ȝF, LD = 34 ȝH, Cy = 3300 pF and LC = 1 mH. 
Experimental result of the design B is presented in Fig. 7. 
    2)  Design Example C (proposed design): Cx1 = Cx2 = 
59 nF, LD = 58 ȝH, Cy = 3300 pF and LC = 1 mH. 
Experimental result of the design C is presented in Fig. 8.

to 30 MHz.

The 2010 International Power Electronics Conference
FCC Class B conducted emission requirement. It is 
confirmed that the proposed design method involves 
considering the MM EMI effects so that the filter size 
reduction is achieved. The proposed theory can be easily 
adapted to practical applications in the design of PFC 
EMI filters, from measuring EMI noise emissions of 
power circuits, to quickly and systematically performing 
filter design. Finally, the effects of the boost-type PFC 
input inductor on the EMI filter performance are carried 
out, along with experimental verifications. The theory 
proposed in this paper could be sufficient for qualitative 
understanding of the input EMI filter design of a low 
harmonic rectifier system based on the boost converter.

Equation (3) shows the sink current Io is almost constant if Rs 
is a qualified resistor and is proportional to the input voltage 
v+. Fig. 3(a) is the typical characteristic of the power LED, 
whose forward current id is function of vd varying in 
exponential form. It is clearly shown that id goes up when vd 
increases and vice versa. In short, any change of forward 
voltage vd on LED will cause id change. In reality, the sink 
current Io through the string LEDs in Fig. 2(a) is determined 
by CCSK. If Io goes up from Il to Im for example, the LED 
voltage vd will then increase from Vl to Vm, the incremental 
voltage in the string loop is that composed of the string LED 
forward voltages and the voltage drop on the sense resistor Rs. 
The resulted incremental voltage will then reduce the vds of 
MOSFET with a constant voltage Vdc from CVS, which may 
push the sink MOSFET into triode region possibly making 
sink current Io inconstant compared with the previous state. 
Fig. 3(b) is the characteristic of a typical MOSFET, in which 
the drain current ids is almost constant in the saturation region, 
but collapse in the triode region. Moving along curve biased 
by vgs2, the drain current ids at points k and q in the saturation 
region are almost constant, i.e., Ik=Ip. When moving into the 
triode region such as at point p, the current ids is getting low 
and not constant. More importantly, in this case since the vds 
of MOSFET is getting small, the sink MOSFET would not 
have enough tolerance room for absorbing the voltage rise on 
the string loop to maintain sink current constant. Accordingly, 
the reduction of vds following the increase of Io may lead sink 
MOSFET entering the triode region, which certainly limits 
the increasing of sink current in CCSK and restricts the 
luminous output from LEDs. However, the operating point of 
MOSFET is often determined by empirical-oriented approach 
in usual application. If the operation point is placed at such as 
point q or far from triode region in Fig. 3(b), the current ids is 
quite constant but dealing with heat dissipation on the sink 
MOSFET and sense resistor will be a significant issue, 
especially in high luminous output. 
 
III. LDCVR WITH CCSK FOR MULTI-LEDS DRIVES 
The proposed LDCVR for building a low-dropout vds of 
the sink MOSFET realize the properly making luminous 
output of the string LEDs in CCSK during a wide dimming 
range as explored in Fig. 4. The LDCVR is simply a buck 
converter, with control referred to a low-dropout detector 
(LDD) from the sink MOFET, consisting of a differential 
amplifier A2 and an error amplifier A3. Only one of the 
parallel CCSKs, namely master current sink, is selected as 
detection reference. The rest of slave CCSKs are also 
supplied from the LDCVR and reference to the dimmer 
control to gain almost balance string currents each other due 
to well current mirror existing between gm amplifiers. The 
LDD is designed to monitor the vds of MOSFET from the 
master CCSK not over or below a specified voltage vref2 to 
maintain the MOSFET working in the saturation region but 
not far from the triode region. A buck converter with varying 
its reference vref3 at error amplifier A4 achieves a variable 
voltage source (VVS) to realize the proposed control theme 
master CCSK, a low-dropout detector (LDD) and a buck 
converter, but not showing the four slave CCSKs. A LED 
display panel fulfilling a 5 parallel strings with each string of 3 
LEDs (5×3 LEDs) is involved in this example. All CCSKs are 
survived at the dimmer reference Vref1 for providing equal 
current in each string with reference to the master CCSK. In 
this design, there are total of 15 power LEDs in the display 
panel consisting of 5 parallel strings with each string of 3 
LEDs in series.

Predicted power loss in MOSFET at low-dropout voltage 1.5V 
 
V. DESIGN AND EXPERIMENT 
The LDD in Fig. 7 consists of operational amplifiers 
(OPAs) A2 and A3, in which the differential amplifier A2 
manipulates the low-dropout voltage detection at vds of Q1 
and the error amplifier A3 compares the output voltage with a 
specified reference Vref2, where Vref2 is the desired low-
dropout voltage, say 1.5V for example. A junction FET 
(JFET) dictated by Vea2 of A3 is designed to provide its 
intrinsic resistance parallel with R1 to determine the desired 
output voltage Vdc of LDCVR. After finishing the LDD 
detection and the achieved reference Vref3, the LDCVR is built 
with the dictated PWM control formed by an error amplifier 
A4 and a PWM comparator A5. In this design, a quad 
operation amplifier HA17324 is used to handle the control of 
LDCVR in master stage.

two quad OPAs, in which the four slave CCSKs are linked 
following the master control and supplied from the LDCVR 
to achieve current balance between the five parallel LEDs 
strings. In Fig. 7, the sink current Io responsible for the 
dimming range is specified from 20mA to 260mA. With 
suitable arrangement of the load lines under the specified Io 
and low-dropout vds=1.5V, the current sensor Rs can be 
graphically given in Fig. 5 with equation (5). If we take 
medium Io=140mA as reference and letting Vdc=14V, 
Vd=2.85V, vds=1.5V, and Vdd=14-3×2.85=5.45V, the Rs=28Ω 
is then given. The LDD is easily implemented by two of quad 
operation amplifier HA17324 with reference vref2=-1.5V. The 
JFET Q3 driven by the output of A3 can then provide 
intrinsic resistance from 1.22kΩ to 2.927kΩ corresponding to 
LDCVR output ranged from 10V to 16V. The output voltage 
Vdc of LDCVR is mainly determined by the intrinsic 
resistance of JFET Q3 commanded from LDD. A 50W buck 
converter with variable output voltage ranged from 9V to 
18V is achieved to supply 5 parallel strings of LEDs, in 
which each string will dissipate maximum power about 
2.34W at Io=260mA and output maximum luminous flux of 
53.8 kcd/m2. Experiment shows that the output voltage Vdc of 
LDCVR in Fig. 8a adaptively following the voltage change 
on string LEDs under Io change, which is close to the 
predicted estimation in Fig. 7a. Comparing with Fig. 7b, Fig. 
8b shows the low dropout voltage vds is around the specified 
1.5V quite the same as the estimation during a wide sink 
current Io. Remarkably, the sink current Io can be controlled 
by an available vgs. The conduction loss of the sink MOSFET 
in Fig. 8c is kept not over 380mW at maximum sink current 
Io=260mA, which meets the predicted estimation. The 
Luminous output corresponding to sink current Io and Vdc of 
LDCVR with respect to dimmer reference Vref1 (dimmer 
voltage) is shown in Fig. 9, which accordingly outputs 
luminance varying from 5.3 kcd/m2 to 53.8 kcd/m2 at a 
measure distance of 50cm. 
The experimental result also shows well performance of 
LEDs with normal luminous output during wide sink current
