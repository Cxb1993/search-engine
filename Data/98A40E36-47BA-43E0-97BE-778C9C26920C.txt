Section 3: System and Signal Models 
Figure 1 depicts a typical scenario of a WRAN cognitive radio, where the primary user, i.e., customer 
premises equipment (CPE) I, is located inside an ATSC network and the secondary users are WRAN terminals. 
Besides the ATSC network, there are two WRAN users, one being the local WRAN user (CPE II, for which 
all performance metrics are defined in this paper) and the other is a neighbor WRAN user (CPE III). The 
WRAN users have to detect the primary ATSC signal and the secondary WRAN signals to avoid harmful 
interference to the ATSC network and the other WRANs. If the CPE resides in the region I in Figure 1, it may 
receive the signal of its own WRAN cell in addition to the ATSC signal; if the CPE resides in the region II, it 
may detect the ATSC and the other WRAN signals; if the CPE is located in the region III, it may receive both 
its own WRAN and the other WRAN signals, but not the ATSC signal. 
Figure 2 plots the ATSC signal frame structure [9]. The ATSC adopts the eight vestigial sideband (VSB) 
modulation to reduce the required bandwidth of the corresponding double-sideband modulation and simplify 
the demodulation process of the single-sideband modulation [10]. One ATSC TV channel occupies 6 MHz. 
There are three major parts in a frame, including Segment Sync, Field Sync, and Data + FEC. A frame 
contains 313 segments. Each segment has 832 symbols. A frame has one Field Sync including PN sequences 
for frame synchronization. A segment has one Segment Sync including four symbols with the sequence [+5, 
-5, -5, +5] for segment synchronization. The ATSC signal x1(n) can be written as

where n is the symbol index, an and pn are Segment Sync and Field Sync, respectively, both of which take 
values of ±5, and sn is the Data + FEC with its values being {±1,±3,±5,±7}. 
The WRAN standard adopts OFDMA transmission technology. Figure 3 plots an OFDMA symbol, where 
Nu is the number of subcarriers and Ng is the CP length. Consider an OFDMA with Nu subcarriers. The 
complex data are modulated onto Nu subcarriers using inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). The CP of 
length Ng is inserted at the beginning of each OFDMA symbol to prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI) and 
preserve mutual orthogonality of the subcarriers. The OFDMA signal x2(n) can be expressed as

the WRAN signal is treated as interference here. When Nu is large, x2(n) an be approximated as a complex 
Gaussian distributed random variable owing to the IDFT. The Segment Sync of x1(n) is constant, while the 
Data + FEC is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the hypotheses have the following distributions

 Section 5: Results and Discussions   
Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the detector. A WRAN system in 
[6] and an ATSC system in [9] are considered here. The WRAN system has Nu = 1024 subcarriers, the fast 
Fourier transform (FFT) period is 298.66 μs, and the CP length is Ng = 256, corresponding to an interval of 
74.64 μs. The ATSC system has a Segment Sync with the period of 0.372 μs in each segment (with a period of 
77.3 μs). To verify the accuracy of the obtained results, the AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels are 
considered jointly. 
Figure 7 plots the results of the ATSC signal detection performance in the scenario with only ATSC signal 
over the AWGN channel, where SNR2 = 0 and SNR = 2SNR1. As shown in the figure, the theoretical results 
match to the simulation results very well. As SNR increases, for a given Pfa,1, Pd,1 increases accordingly. 
Because when the signal is present, it is more likely to detect the signal. For a given SNR, as Pfa,1 increases, 
Pd,1 also increases, due to the fact that increasing Pfa,1 lowers the threshold which subsequently increases the 
detection probability. When Pfa,1 is set to 0.1, i.e., the threshold is fixed, to achieve Pd,1 of 0.9, the required 
SNR should be higher than −12 dB. 
Figure 8 plots the results of the ATSC signal detection for the scenario with only ATSC signal over the 
Rayleigh fading channel. Compared with Fig.7, the performance over the Rayleigh fading channel is worse 
than that over the AWGN channel. That is, to achieve the same performance with that over the AWGN 
channel, the required SNR should be increased over the Rayleigh fading channel. Besides, reducing the 
threshold only gradually improves the detection probability.  Figure 9 illustrates the results of the WRAN 
signal detection performance in the scenario with only WRAN signal over the AWGN channel. In this 
scenario, SNR1 = 0 dB. Similar to the ATSC detection, when Pfa,1 is set to 0.1, to achieve a Pd,1 of 0.9, the 
required SNR should be higher than −12 dB.   
Figure 10 gives the results of the WRAN signal detection in the scenario with only WRAN signal present 
over the Rayleigh fading channel. Compared to Figure 9, the performance over the Rayleigh fading channel is 
worse than that over the AWGN channel. Compared to the results shown in Figure 8, the performance of the 
WRAN signal detection over the Rayleigh fading channel is better than that of the ATSC signal detection over 
the Rayleigh fading channel. If Pfa,1 is set to 0.1, to achieve a Pd,1 of 0.9, the required SNR should be greater 
than −6 dB.

Abstract—Recently, cognitive radio (CR) has recently emerged
as a useful technology to improve the efficiency of spectrum
utilization. However, wireless networks are accompanied with
an important security flaw that they are much easier to be
attacked than any wired network. Many security issues are
discovered. Within which, the most important one is primary
user emulation attack (PUEA). In this work, we propose a method
by using the characteristics of wireless channels to identify the
PUEA. In the wireless environment, the statistical property of the
wireless channel between the receiver and transmitter is unique;
therefore, we can use this feature as a radio fingerprint. By
employing the capability of spectrum sensing in CR, we can
identify primary user emulation attackers via the uniqueness of
wireless channels. Compared with conventional security schemes
based on higher layer protocols, whose information must be
passed to the upper layers, the proposed scheme using physical
layer is more efficient in terms of the detection time. Simulations
confirm the advantages of the proposed scheme.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless communication devices today have led to an urgent
requirement for precious radio spectrum[1]. According to
the study of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on
the traditional spectrum assignment policy, the utilization of
static spectrum allocation at any time and space is between
15% and 85%[2]. This paradox situation can be solved by
the emerging dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and cognition
communication.
A. Cognitive Radio
Cognition communication is a popular technique, which can
improve the spectrum utilization. The concept, proposed by
Mitola [3], aims at solving the problem of scarce spectrum
and poor allocation. The cognitive radio (CR) user needs to
continuously monitor radio spectrum usage, which is used to
give precedence to primary user (PU). That is, when PU starts
to transmit signals, secondary users (SU) will switch to another
spectrum hole.
In past few years, CR has received much attention. However,
security issue are rarely discussed. The security issues were
first investigated by Burbank [4] and Clancy [5] for cognitive
radio networks (CRN).
B. Primary User Emulation Attacks
Malicious users may emulate PUs’ signal characteristic,
which can subsequently reduce the spectrum utilization. This
behavior is named primary user emulation attacks (PUEA)[6].
Discrimination between PUs and SUs is an important ability
against PUEA.
C. Related Works
In recent years, some works [7] and [8] address the issue
of detection the PUEA in CR. In [7], the authors propose to
distinguish the identity of transmitter by the wireless channel
characteristic. However, the channel is modeled as a path-loss
and large-scale shadowing. In [8], the authors consider sensing
the unique physical property over time-invariant channels
to differentiate the channel states between transmitters and
receivers.
The main contribution of this paper is to distinguish the
primary user emulate (PUE) attacker from PU by the channel-
based detection. We employ the Neyman-Pearson test in
discriminating channel states of transmitters over Rayleigh
fading channels. The new scheme using physical layer is more
efficient than conventional techniques in terms of the detection
time.
D. Organization
Section II introduces the system model. Section III intro-
duces the OFDM model and correlation characteristics and
channel power estimation. Section IV presents the proposed
Channel-Based Authentication. Section V demonstrates the
simulation results. Finally, section V draw conclusions.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Scenario
In the multipath environment of wireless communication,
the uniqueness of the channel between two locations has been
proved in [9]. We seek to develop the concept of physical
layer authentication for CR. Figure 1. depicts the scenario
of the wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM). The area in circle is the sensing area of SU. The SU
might detect the PU, PUEA or other SUs during the spectrum
sensing. Some malicious transmitters can emulate the signal
of PU to achieve their selfish aims. The proposed detection
method can distinguish the PU from PUEA.
B. Channel Model
In this work, h(l) denotes the lth channel impulse response
of multipath channels with (L+1) uncorrelated taps. The
wireless channels are assumed to be Rayleigh fading. Based on

following property.
Property 1: The correlation of separated-by-N samples has
the complement property for separated-by-NCP correlations
in I1 and I3. That is,
E [x˜m (n) x˜
∗
m (n+N)]+
E [x˜m (n+NCP ) x˜
∗
m (n+N +NCP )]
= Const for n ∈ I1.
(13)
The correlation (4) is illustrated in Fig. 2. Note that actual
values depend on the channel-tap gains. Non-zero correlation
values of separated-by-N samples are owing to the CP. Due to
the linear convolution of the transmitted data with the channel,
the length of nonzero correlation values is NCP + L.
Theorem 1: Let rˆk,m (n) ≡

be the maximum likelihood estimation of rk,m ≡
E [x˜k,m (n) x˜k,m (n+N)] over all symbols within the mth,
superscript k denotes the current burst, where 〈·〉 is the time
average over M symbols, then rˆk,m (n) is asymptotically
distributed according to
rˆk (n) ∼ Nr

(14)
where Nr (·) denotes the Gaussian distribution for a real
random variable and σ is

According to the (3),the channel-tap power can be obtained
by
pˆ = σ−2x D

Since the estimation (16) is a linear combination of Gaus-
sian random variables, the power estimate is also Gaussian
distributed with
pˆ ∼ Nr (p¯,C) (17)
where
p¯ ≡ σ−2x E

IV. CHANNEL-BASED AUTHENTICATION
Section III estimates the channel-tap power over the
Rayleigh fading channel. In this section, we use the hypothesis
test to decide if the transmission terminal is PU or PUEA, i.e.,
H0 : pˆ is PU
H1 : pˆ is PUEA. (18)
According to (17), the properties of the hypotheses are
H0 : pˆ ∼ N (pI,CI)
H1 : pˆ ∼ N (pA,CA) (19)
where superscripts I and A denote PU and PUEA, respec-
tively, C denotes the coveriance matrix. The likelihood ratio
test(LRT) can be expressed as
Λ = f(pˆ|H1)f(pˆ|H0)
=
√

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a new method to against the PUEA
in CRN. The uniqueness of channel-tap powers between the
receiver and transmitter is utilized. Simulations indicate that
the proposed anti-PUEA technique has good performance. Ac-
cordingly, the proposed technique can identify the transmitters
to defend against PUEA. The proposed scheme using physical
layer is more efficient than conventional techniques in terms
of detection time. In the future, we will study a cooperative
detection method and analyze more wireless attacks by using
the features of wireless channels.
