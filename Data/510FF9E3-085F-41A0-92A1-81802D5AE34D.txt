英文摘要 
Interferometric displacement measurement is still an active research field for 
industrial and scientific purposes.  This is due to its non-contact nature and high 
resolution during the measurement.  However, the periodic error of displacement 
measurement still remains unsolved when the required accuracy down to 
nano-meter range.  Therefore, a heterodyne interferometer associates with 
differential phase to amplitude conversion technique to address this problem is 
proposed.  In the proposed scheme, two heterodyne signal in quadrature are 
generated, each of which carries the phase shift (differential phase) introduced by 
displacement.  This differential phase is coded in the amplitudes of the 
quadrature heterodyne signals by proposed conversion technique and also in 
quadrature.  Therefore, the common phase noises that arise from environmental 
perturbations and introduced by polarization coupling are removed by conversion 
operation.  In particular, the displacement measurement is carried out regardless 
of the slight elliptical polarization state of incident laser beam.  During the 
measurement, the quadrature amplitudes are calculated in real time by least square 
fit with the sampling values of quadrature heterodyne signals and then the 
instantaneous differential phase is determined by the ratio of these amplitudes.  
The fringe counting and displacement direction decision are also obtained during 
the calculations.  Thus the real time displacement measurement without periodic 
error can be achieved by proposed heterodyne interferometric scheme.

in nanoscale.  In this approach, the differential phase introduced by the 
displacement is converted into the amplitudes of heterodyne signals in quadrature.  
Meanwhile the heterodyne signals in phase quadrature are also achieved so that the 
displacement can be determined from the amplitude ratio of the quadrature signals, 
and the direction of displacement can be determined from the phase quadrature.  
Since the differential phase to quadrature amplitude conversion is achieved through 
the optical addition and subtraction by polarization tuning, which are based on 
differential detection concept.  Thus the proposed method benefits from the 
features of differential detection with common phase noise and correlated 
amplitude noise rejection and that of quadrature detection with real time and wide 
dynamic range of phase measurement.  To demonstrate the capability of proposed 
method in differential phase measurement, we measure the displacement drove by a 
commercially available PZT pusher and found close agreement between the 
experiment and the theory.  The experimental evidence of noise suppression is 
also found with spectral measurements, which demonstrates the resolution of 
displacement measurement at 60 pm and minimum detectable differential phase of 
5.6x10-6 rad/ Hz  over 50 KHz . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
The determination of differential phase introduced by displacement with 
interferometric technique is widely employed, for example, in the production 
control [1] or lever deflection of atomic force microscope [2] where the non-contact 
and high resolution with nanometric scale is required.  These measurements also 
require many aspects of design, instrumentation and analysis techniques.  Among 
various interferometric interrogation methods for measuring the displacement in 
PBS and wave plates are required to maintain π /2 phase difference between each 
interference signals, these additional optical devices may result in measurement 
error due to unwanted polarization coupling or imperfect optical devices.  In the 
fringe projection scheme, the alignment of the wavefront of interference beams is 
difficult to maintain and calibrate during the target movement, as a result, the 
measurement error arises due to the complete period of fringe spacing does not 
equal to the length of four-detector element.  Regarding these drawbacks of 
two-detector scheme and four-detector scheme for quadrature detection, we present 
a two-detector scheme approach with heterodyne interferometric configuration, in 
which both the amplitude and phase of output signals in quadrature are obtained in 
the same time by adjusting the polarization states of the interference beams with a 
half wave plate (HWP).  This is different from typical quadrature detection 
schemes where the differential phase remains as a phase term in the quadrature 
interference signals.  By using the proposed two-detector scheme, the additional 
optical devices for producing quadrature signals are not required and the 
advantages of quadrature detection for extracting the differential phase are 
preserved.  The direction of moving can be determined from the phase quadrature 
signals using the same technique as that of typical quadrature detection scheme.  
The differential phase to quadrature amplitude conversion developed in this 
investigation is an optical version of the differential phase detection developed 
previously based on balanced detection using differential amplifier for high 
resolution phase measurements [11-13].  In this investigation, the optical addition 
and subtraction operations are performed by polarization adjustment, which 
eliminates the common phase noises that resulted from the environmental 
disturbances.  Meanwhile, the correlated amplitude noise arises from the intensity 
fluctuation [14] of laser source is also reduced.  In addition, an external 
modulation configuration [15] is adopted, which is free of frequency mixing, 
therefore the periodic error of displacement measurement is considered as second 
order effect [16] mainly arisen from the polarization mixing [17].  This error 
and Q2 are oriented at π /4 relative to the horizontal direction defined by the 
incident plane spanned by PBS1 and the incident beam.  As a result, the linear 
polarization direction of each beam rotated π /2 with respect to the azimuth 
directions of Q1 and Q2.  Thus the two beams are recombined at PBS1 after 
reflected from Mr and Ms and propagated collinearly to the HWP (H2) from exit 
port of PBS1 without energy loss.  We use Jones matrix to describe the amplitude 
and phase variations of P and S polarized laser beams respectively along the 
propagation path.  The imperfection of PBS1 that results in polarization mixing is 
also taken into account.  The measurement error due to small elliptical 
polarization is assumed as second order effect [16], and will be considered in 
section 4.  Let Ein be the Jones matrix of laser beam that incident on the Michelson 
interferometer and JT and JR are the Jones matrixes for transmission and reflection 
of PBS1, these two matrixes are also the Jones matrixes for the transmission and 
reflection of PBS2.  The phase shifts introduced by PBS to the transmitted and 
reflected beams are assumed constant and equally experienced by P and S polarized 
components, thus they are neglected.  Thus the Jones matrix of Ein, JT and JR can 
be described by 
 Ein=a

⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ , JT =

0 t
⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ ,  JR =

r⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠         
 (1) 
where a is the amplitude of incident laser beam.  The parameters t and r denote the 
amplitude extinctions of PBS1 and PBS2 where t 1 and r 1.  In Eq. (1), the 
time varying part is omitted, it can be recovered any time.  Thus for the reference 
beam Eref exits from PBS1 after reflected from the mirror Mr can be written as 
 Eref = JTJQ(-π /4)JMJQ(π /4)JR Einexp(i SΦ )       
 (2) 
where JQ(π /4) and JQ(-π /4) are the Jones matrixes of QWP that experienced by 
the reference beam in counter-directions.  JM represents the Jones matrix of Mr.  
between the electric fields of reference beam and probe beam in P and S polarized 
components respectively.  The optical subtraction and addition will be realized 
after heterodyning.   
On the other hand, the laser beam E2 (carrier beam) that reflected from BS1 is 
frequency shifted to 2ω  by AOM2 and combines E1 at BS2 and then split by 
another PBS (PBS2).  If the Jones matrix of E2 is expressed by  
 E2= b

where b is the amplitude of the carrier beam.  By taking into account the 
imperfection of PBS2, the electric fields EP and ES toward the photo-detectors PDp 
and DPs respectively are

From Eq. (8a), the heterodyne interference signal IP is the sum of interference 
signals of P polarized and S polarized components.  By using trigonometric 
equalities, the signal IP is given by 
IP=2abη (1- rt)[cos( ω∆ t+ PΦ )-cos( ω∆ t+ SΦ )] 
   +2abη t2(1- rt)[cos( ω∆ t+ PΦ )+cos( ω∆ t+ SΦ )] 
≈4abη (1- rt)sin(∆Φ /2)cos( ω∆ t+ Pα )        
 (9) 
In Eq. (9), the subtraction and addition between heterodyne interference signals are 
implemented optically, the differential phase ∆Φ is converted through the 
decreasing.  The result of theoretical calculation of quadrature phase α∆  versus 
differential phase ∆Φ  is shown in Fig. 2.  Thereby signals in phase quadrature 
are also achieved, which provides the information of direction of moving and 
unambiguous of phase measurement beyond 2π .   
 
3. Experimental results 
Figure 1 schematically shows the optical arrangement for displacement 
measurement. An isolator (ISO) before He-Na laser combines with AOM so that 
the reflected light from traveling back to the laser cavity is rejected.  The azimuth 
angle of QWP and HWP are calibrated by use of previously developed technique 
[18].  The photo- detectors (New focus 4001) operated at AC mode are calibrated 
against the incident intensity.  During the experiment, the heterodyne frequency 
ω∆ /2π =10.0 KHz is introduced by two AOMs.  The phase lead or lag regarding 
the output phase quadrature signals is determined by the logic circuit.  The low 
pass filters (LPF) cascaded by data acquisition (DAQ) with 330 KHz sampling rate 
at 10 bit length transfers the amplitude signals and the information of phase lead or 
lag to personal computer (PC).  Then the amount of phase change due to 
displacement relative to the previous one and the accumulation of differential phase 
regarding the quadrature phase lead or lag are determined in real time.  To 
demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach for small displacement 
measurement, the mirror Ms is driven by a preloaded PZT pusher (PI, P-170.00).  
Figure 3 displays the sampled heterodyne signals IP (circle) and IS (star) from the 
photo-detectors before LPF when Ms is driven by PZT pusher.  It clearly shows 
the high frequency carriers are modulated by low frequency differential phase 
signal where the quadrature amplitude with quadrature phase is evident.  The 
measured result of step movement by PZT pusher with 19.0 nm per step is shown 
in Fig. 4.  We also drive the PZT pusher at 10 Hz with about 50 nm peak to peak 
displacement and at 20 Hz with about 1.4 µ m peak to peak displacement 
measurement proves the validity of differential phase to quadrature amplitude 
conversion in optical version described by Eqs. (8a) and (8b).  Once the laser 
beam reflected from Ms is absent, the amplitudes of heterodyne interference as 
described by Eqs. (9) and (10) are decreased by half.  Curve IV shows the 
classical noise floor of the system.  The overlapping between the spectrum of 
curve III and that of noise floor shows the possibility of quantum-noise-limited 
detection for the proposed scheme.  It is also observed from Fig. 7 that when the 
differential phase approaches zero as shown by curve III, the spectral distribution of 
heterodyne signal IP around the harmonic frequencies are eliminated, which proves 
the characteristic feature of noise suppression capability by differential phase to 
quadrature amplitude conversion.  The similar noise suppression with high 
performance was achieved with the interferometric system proposed by Sun [21] 
where even order of the harmonics are eliminated. 
 
4. Discussions  
In section 2, we describe the system by only taking into account the imperfections 
of PBS, which results in polarization coupling induced periodic error to the 
measurement.  This periodic error is also introduced by small elliptical 
polarization state of incident beam.  If the small elliptical polarization of the 
incident beam is described by 
Ein=a
1
exp( )iε
⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠               
 (13) 
where ε  1 denotes the small phase shift between horizontal component and 
vertical component of a linear polarized beam oriented at π /4 to the horizontal 
direction, then the quadrature signals from PDp and PDs become 
 P,I ε =Asin( 2
ε∆Φ − )[1-rt sin(( ) / 2)
sin(( ) / 2)

ε
∆Φ +
∆Φ − ]cos( ω∆ t+ ,P εα )    
 (14) 
quadrature amplitude conversion can be performed if the azimuth angle of H2 is 
oriented at (2n+1)3π /8.  Since the conversion is also based on optical subtraction 
and addition by polarization tuning at these angles, it results in phase quadrature.  
Moreover, the optical subtraction and addition operations give the possibility for 
dark fringe detection [22].  The ultra-high phase sensitive with dark fringe 
detection can be achieved if a phase bias at 2nπ  is exerted on the differential 
phase ∆Φ  in Eq. (9), or a phase bias at (2n+1)π  on ∆Φ  in Eq. (10) where n is 
integer.  Both phase bias keep the corresponding amplitude of heterodyne signal 
closes to zero, which reduces the excess noise and classical noise significantly in 
direct detection techniques. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, we demonstrate an optical approach for quadrature detection with a 
simple optical configuration.  The differential phase to quadrature amplitude 
conversion also results in phase quadrature simultaneously so that the common 
phase noise and the correlated amplitude noise are eliminated.  Meanwhile the 
displacement can be measured with high resolution and the 2π  ambiguity of 
interferometric measurement is removed.  Due to the phase to amplitude 
conversion scheme, the high frequency carrier is amplitude modulated by the low 
frequency differential phase signal, this makes the signal demodulation simple and 
the measurement can be performed in real time.  The plot of Lissajous trajectory 
of the quadrature amplitudes also demonstrates small periodic error of displacement 
measurement.  From the spectral distribution of the output heterodyne signal, it is 
found that the harmonics are eliminated where high sensitive differential phase 
detection can be obtained.

System description 
We combine a Michelson interferometer with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer as an external 
modulation configuration shown in Fig. 1. One of the beams separated by beam splitter BS1 is 
injected into the Michelson interferometer, the optical frequency is shifted to 1ω  by AO1. A 
polarized beam splitter (PBS1)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separates the incident laser beam into horizontal polarization (P) and vertical polarized (S) beams 
with equal amplitudes. The P beam as a probe beam is directed to a moving mirror (Ms) driven a 
PZT and the S beam as a reference beam is directed to a fixed reference mirror (Mr). Each beam 
traverses a quarter wave plate (QWP) twice. We use Jones matrix to describe the amplitude and 
phase variations along the propagation path. The imperfection of PBS1 that results in polarization 
mixing is taken into account. If the frequency of carrier beam is shifted to 2ω by AO2. The 
heterodyne interference signal IP becomes 
IP ≈4abη (1- rt)sin(∆Φ /2)cos( ω∆ t+ Pα )                    
 (1) 
where t 1 and r 1 are the amplitude extinction ratio for transmission and reflection from PBS. 
Under similar mathematical treatment, the heterodyne interference signal IS generated by 
photo-detector PDs can be found 
                         IS ≈4abη (1+rt)cos( ∆Φ /2)cos( ω∆ t+ Sα )     
                                 (2) 
η  is the responsivity of photodiodes, which are considered equal for PDp and PDs, ω∆ = 1ω - 2ω  
is the heterodyne frequency. It can be observed from Eqs. (1) and (2) that a high frequency carrier 
is amplitude modulated by the differential phase ∆Φ  as amplitude quadrature signals. The 
common phase variations are left in the phase terms Pα  and Sα , therefore the common phase 
noise is removed form the amplitude while the differential phase ∆Φ  can be determined from 
the calculation with amplitudes |IP|, |IS| by  
                           ∆Φ =2 tan-1[ P S| I | / | I | ]       
                                                             
(3) 
Therefore, the high resolution and accurate displacement measurement by the proposed scheme is 
expected. The theoretical calculation of phase difference α∆ = Pα - Sα  versus differential phase 
∆Φ  also shows phase quadrature characteristic of proposed method.   
Experiments 
To demonstrate the capability of the proposed scheme in amplitude and phase quadrature, Fig. 2 
displays the sampled heterodyne signals IP (circle) and IS (star) before LPF. It clearly shows the 
high frequency carriers are modulated by low frequency differential phase signal where the

2.   System description 
We combine a Michelson interferometer with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer as an external 
modulation configuration shown in Fig. 1. One of the beams separated by beam splitter BS1 is 
injected into the Michelson interferometer, the optical frequency is shifted to 1ω  by AO1. A 
polarized beam splitter (PBS1)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separates the incident laser beam into horizontal polarization (P) and vertical polarized (S) beams 
with equal amplitudes. The P beam as a probe beam is directed to a moving mirror (Ms) driven a 
PZT and the S beam as a reference beam is directed to a fixed reference mirror (Mr). Each beam 
traverses a quarter wave plate (QWP) twice. We use Jones matrix to describe the amplitude and 
phase variations along the propagation path. The imperfection of PBS1 that results in polarization 
mixing is taken into account. If the frequency of carrier beam is shifted to 2ω by AO2. The 
heterodyne interference signal IP becomes 
IP ≈4abη (1- rt)sin(∆Φ /2)cos( ω∆ t+ Pα )                     
 (1) 
where t 1 and r 1 are the amplitude extinction ratio for transmission and reflection from PBS. 
Under similar mathematical treatment, the heterodyne interference signal IS generated by 
photo-detector PDs can be found 
                         IS ≈4abη (1+rt)cos(∆Φ /2)cos( ω∆ t+ Sα )      
                                (2) 
η  is the responsivity of photodiodes, which are considered equal for PDp and PDs, ω∆ = 1ω - 2ω  is 
the heterodyne frequency. It can be observed from Eqs. (1) and (2) that a high frequency carrier is 
amplitude modulated by the differential phase ∆Φ  as amplitude quadrature signals. The common 
phase variations are left in the phase terms Pα  and Sα , therefore the common phase noise is 
removed form the amplitude while the differential phase ∆Φ  can be determined from the 
calculation with amplitudes |IP|, |IS| by  
                           ∆Φ =2 tan-1[ P S| I | / | I | ]        
                                                            (3) 
Therefore, the high resolution and accurate displacement measurement by the proposed scheme is 
expected. The theoretical calculation of phase difference α∆ = Pα - Sα  versus differential phase 
∆Φ  also shows phase quadrature characteristic of proposed method.
