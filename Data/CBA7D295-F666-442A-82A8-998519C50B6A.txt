Abstract 
 
A granular material is a set of macroscopic discrete particles.  Instead of the discrete method 
which requires a vast amount of numerical calculations, continuum method is an effective tool to 
analyze the motion of granular media. The traditional continuum method is not able to provide a 
detailed description of internal structure, characterizing the intricate relative motion among 
particles. One of the aims of this project is to use the microstretch modeling to describe the 
response of dry monodisperse granular materials. We will adopt an appropriate averaging method 
to obtain all field quantities from their granular discrete counterparts. There are rotational and 
dilatant degrees of freedom for a macroscopic point in a microstretch continuum, from which one 
can model the rotational and dilatant effects near the shear bands, occurring in a granular body. 
We intend to find the rapture mechanism, the reason of generating shear bands, and related issues 
about those bands. Another purpose of this project is to study the behavior of granular gases. In 
the experiment of a two-compartmental vibrated bed, we will use the PTV system to record the 
position of every particle. Using the positions of particles, the granular temperature of the system 
can be achieved from the information of particle velocities. The temperature-driven and 
concentration-driven mechanism of granular oscillation will be discussed. In addition, the MD 
simulation method will be also used to investigate a granular sustem. The major topics of this 
study are the clustering and separation of particles.

二、緣由與目的 
 
Rapid advances in material science and technology have made materials with 
microstructures more common in widespread use. As researchers increase their knowledge of the 
mechanical properties of these materials, the development of these materials is continuously 
accelerated. To date, researchers have not yet established a complete well mechanical theory for

concentration difference dominates the initial stage of light-particle motion. 
As far as the compartmentalized granular gases, there is no any attention paid to the subject 
of non-equal (or nonsymmetrical) compartments, which involves the difference in particle 
clustering ability between two compartments. We discuss this issue in this project and then find a 
surprising phenomenon (told by the two referees of my manuscript submitted to Physical Review 
E), as briefly introduced in the following.

Part I: Microstretch granular materials

and they are represented by

四、 成果自評 
 
In this project we have conducted several works. The major contributions are (i) the advantage of 
the indices (microgyration tensor) to describe the evolution of shear band, (ii) the discovery of 
unsymmetric oscillation periods for bisdisperse granular gases, (iii) the interpretation of the 
switch and bifurcation of granular oscillation, and (iv) the surprising outcome form MD 
simulation showing the stability of particles staying in the large or the small compartment.

of particles should stay in small compartment with a longer time, comparing with staying in large 
compartment. Contrary to the extension expected from flux analysis, this study demonstrates that 
the time for particles staying in large compartment within one single oscillation period is longer 
than that in small compartment by using the experimental measurement and the DEM simulation. 
 
II. Experimental Setup and Observation 
The experimental setup consists of two acrylic containers, C1 and C2, of dimensions WxD 
xH=93x4.8x154 mm3, with W being the container width, D the depth, and H the height. Container 
C1 is divided into two equal compartments by an acrylic barrier 5 mm thick, with a height h of 52 
mm. The left and right compartments of both container are designated as Zone I and Zone II, 
respectively. Container C2 is nonsymmetrical and is divided by the barrier with the same 
dimension. The left Zone I in C2 is 42 mm in width, and the right Zone II has a width of 46 mm. 
Two containers are respectively mounted on the top of a vertically-vibrating shaker (Aurora 
VTS-65). A function generator (Good Will Instrument SFG-2004) is used to control the 
sinusoidal signal sent to the shaker, and an amplifier (Harman International CE 1000) magnifies 
the signal. An accelerometer (PCB) monitors the container acceleration 2(2 ) /a f gπΓ = , where 
g denotes the gravitational acceleration, and the amplitude a and the frequency f of the vibration 
are fixed at 5 mm and 20 Hz, respectively. This study adopts two types of spherical balls with the 
same diameter 4 mm. The first type of 35 balls used as heavy particles (HPs) is made of stainless 
steel (mass density 7.92 g/cm3 and restitution coefficient ehh=0.85) and the second of 90 balls as 
light particles (LPs) is made of polypropylene (mass density 0.90 g/cm3 and ell=0.90). Since the 
container depth is slightly greater than the particle size, we can precisely trace the position of 
every particle in this quasi-2D system. 
To measure the positions of all particles, a high-speed camera (IDT XS5, 1040 maximum 
frames/s) is used and the related particle velocities can be obtained by particle tracking 
velocimetry (PTV) technique. Figure I illustrates a time series of granular oscillation photos for 
C2 container, showing the granular follower behavior and the oscillation period of about 94 sec. 
After 5-minite continuous observation, the statistical data shows that the time required for 
particles moving from Zone I to Zone II is approximately 40 sec, which is smaller than 54 sec 
required in an inverse direction. The same experiment has also been performed in a symmetric 
container C1, revealing an equal time period 45 sec moving between the two zones. For 
comparison, Table I presents the time periods of granular oscillation in the two containers. This 
experimental result will be numerically simulated in the following section, where a soft-core 
DEM code is adopted to analyze the evolution of granular oscillation as well as the evolutions for 
granular temperatures and centers of mass for the two types of particles.

In our 3D simulation, the parameters for container dimension, mass density, and particle 
number are the same as those used in our experiment. The material properties for the simulation 
are specified as ( , , , , , , , ) (200 ,1.7 ,3.2 ,0.3,0.15,0.15,0.25,0.1)h l c h l cE E E GPa GPa GPaυ γ γ γ μ =  
which give rise to various coefficients of normal restitution as 0.85ll hh lhe e e= = = , 0.79lwe = , 
and 0.84hwe = . Each time step is chosen as 610t −= sec. 
The evolutions of particle numbers for the two types of particle are recorded, and they are 
presented in terms of the evolutions of proportion ( / )i in N Nα α α=  for type-α particle in Zone i. 
Besides, we also calculate the centers of mass and the granular temperatures for both types of 
particles in the two zones, where the granular temperature iTα  is defined as

with ϕ  being the average of the physical quantity ϕ .

IV. Flux Model Analysis 
To find the reason why the times for particles moving between the two zones are different, 
we try to explore the basic response for the flux function, which dominates the motion of 
particles in a compartmentalized system. 
For the description of Maxwell demon experiment, Eggers first developed a flux model, 
where the fraction-dependent flux function ( )F n  grows from zero for 0n =  to a maximum, 
and then decreases asymptotically towards zero. In a previous study to explore the mechanism of 
granular oscillation in a symmetric system, we consider the different temperatures for two types 
of particles and modify the flux function to

−= Ω                                (8) 
where Ω  is the ground area of a single compartment and b  is the container depth. Based on 
our previous experimental observation, a strict relation, / 0.1l hT Tγ = = , between the two 
temperatures is imposed to such that the granular temperature can be theoretically solved as 
2( )hT afψ=                                                          (9) 
by just taking into account the balance between the input energy obtained from the container 
bottom and the dissipative energy due to the inelastic collisions between particles. In Eq. (9) ψ  
is expressed by

In a nonsymmetrical system, the above analysis can be also applied by adopting the same 
relation / 0.1l hT Tγ = =  and replacing Ω  by iΩ . In addition, we introduce a material constant 
K  and two functions ( )i ilp χ  and ( )i ihp χ  such that the flux function is modified to

and ihc  are related to the container geometry so that we set 
I IIc cα ακ= , where II I( / )κ ≡ Ω Ω , 
describing the nonsymmetry of the container, is defined as the ratio of the two compartment 
widths. With the flux function in Eq. (12), the evolutions of number for two types of particle are 
written as 
 - 10 - 10
To explain the difference in time period, we perform a flux-model analysis, which illustrates that 
the difference in the two LP-fluxes for particles moving from Zone I to II is larger than that from 
Zone II to I.
