Abstract—This project proposes hybrid optimization 
approaches incorporating particle swarm optimization 
(PSO) with the use of a center particle in a swarm and an 
enhanced Nelder-Mead simplex search method to solve 
multi-dimensional optimization problems. Because of the 
strength of PSO in explorative search and NM simplex 
search in exploitative search in addition to the extra help 
from the center particle, which generally resides closest to 
the optimum during the optimization process, both con-
vergence rate and accuracy of the proposed optimization 
algorithms can be significantly improved. To show the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach, 18 benchmark 
functions are adopted for optimization via the proposed 
approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that the hy-
brid optimization schemes have achieved satisfactory re-
sults out-performing the existing approaches. 
 
Keywords —Particle swarm optimization, NM simplex 
search, hybrid optimization, optimization, evolutionary al-
gorithm. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a popula-
tion-based, self-adaptive search optimization technique 
first introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart [1] in 1995. 
Based on simulation of simplified animal social behav-
iors such as fish schooling, bird flocking, etc [2], PSO 
has advantages of simplicity for implementation and 
ability to quickly converge to a reasonably good solution 
[3]. Because of its robustness, PSO has been widely 
adopted in various engineering applications [4], [5], [6]. 
There are, however, still problems on conventional PSOs 
as far as a desired optimization method is concerned. For 
example,  
1. Convergence of optimization becomes staggered, 
particularly in the later stage during the evolution 
process [7].  
2. Excessive evolution time might be required, par-
ticularly for complex problems under consideration 
[8].  
3. Proper control of global exploration and local ex-
ploitation is a crucial but not yet fully addressed 
problem [2], [9]. 
4. Performance is found to be highly sensitive to the 
control parameters [10]. 
To solve the above-mentioned problems that con-
ventional PSOs encountered, various modifications have 
been proposed over the past years, particularly the re-
definition of velocity-updating rules and adjustment of 
operation parameters. For example, an inertia weight [11] 
was proposed to change the velocities so that the algo-
rithm can locate the global optima in a more efficient 
way. A constriction factor [12] was used for attaining 
diversity of particles in a population to obtain better 
convergence of the algorithm itself. Many other research 
work [1], [7], [13], [14], [15], [16] also claimed that the 
problems can be solved to some extents, including those 
investigating the selection of control parameters for op-
timality and convergence [17], [18]. As far as a global 
optimizer is concerned, there is still zoom for further 
improvements over the existing PSO approaches in 
terms of robustness and accuracy of the optimization 
algorithms.  
 As an attempt to solve the above-mentioned prob-
lems and difficulties, two hybrid optimization ap-
proaches incorporating PSO with the use of a center 
particle in a swarm [20] and an enhanced Nelder-Mead 
simplex search method [19] are proposed in this paper to 
effectively solve multi-dimensional optimization prob-
lems. Because of the hybridizing effect, where global 
exploration and local exploitation are respectively 
achieved by the PSO emphasizing the use of the center 
particle and the enhanced NM simplex search, the 
proposed optimization approaches are capable of further 
improving the convergence and accuracy in obtaining 
optimal solutions. To show the performance of the 
proposed approach, 18 commonly-adopted benchmark 
functions will be used for optimization to prove its su-
periority in achieving global optimal solutions, in com-
parison with existing methods [21], [22], [23].  
The paper is organized as follows. Section Ⅱ intro-
duces the background of PSO and NM simplex search 
method. Improvements over the traditional NM simplex 
search method are given in Section Ⅲ for later incor-
poration into the PSO algorithm. Two hybrid optimiza-
tion methods incorporating the PSO and NM simplex 
search method are proposed in Section Ⅳ. Experiment 
results of simulation on 18 benchmark functions are 
presented in Section Ⅴ. Conclusions are drawn in Sec-
tion Ⅵ. 
II. PRELIMINARIES OF EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS 
A. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
Particle swarm adaptation has been shown to suc-
cessfully optimize a wide range of continuous functions 
[1], [2]. The algorithm, which is based on a metaphor of 
social interaction, searches a space by adjusting the tra-
jectories of individual vectors, called “particles” as they 
are conceptualized as moving points in multidimen-
sional space [17]. As an evolutionary technique, the PSO 
is a population-based algorithm, formed by a set of par-
ticles representing potential solutions for a given prob-
lem. Each particle moves through a n-dimensional 
search space, with an associated position vector 
xi(t) = {xi1(t), xi2(t),…,xin(t)} and velocity vector 
 3 
, where δ is the shrinkage coefficient (0<δ<1). Nelder 
and Mead [19] suggested 5.0=d .  
III. ENHANCED NM SEARCH METHOD 
Although the conventional NM simplex search 
method has advantages of speedy response in solving 
optimization problems, the selection of starting points is, 
however, very sensitive in obtaining a satisfactory solu-
tion. It is therefore a need to further improve the per-
formance of the conventional NM simplex search 
method. Note that the expansion procedure in the con-
ventional NM simplex search method focuses on the 
further exploration along the promising direction. It is 
natural that we introduce an extra expansion procedure 
in a hope that more promising direction can be further 
explored to improve optimization efficiency.  
A.  Continuous expansion 
Fig. 1 illustrates a two-dimensional continuous ex-
pansion procedure, in which dashed lines stand for the 
operation of the continuous expansion according to the 
following equation: 
 
centconcon XXX )1(expexp ll -+=       (7) 
 
where l  is the continuous expansion coefficient )1( >l , 
for example 2=l . When expX  is better than lowX , the 
continuous expansion is repeatedly performed as long as 
expconX  is better than lowX . Let expconX  replace highX .

B. Perturbed shrinkage 
Some improvements in terms of successful rate and 
convergence have been observed based on experiment 
results in optimizing the 18 benchmark functions via the 
continuous expansion operator. However, there are still 
problems for the shrinkage operator. Note that if the 
simplex after shrinkage does not contain the desired 
optimum, premature convergence generally occurs as a 
result of subsequent iterations. Consequently, when re-
flection, expansion, and inward shrinkage operators 
failed, there is an implication that the optimal solution 
may not reside inside the simplex currently generated. 
Further application of the shrinkage operator is not de-
sired. Under this circumstance, a modification to the 
shrinkage operator is proposed according to the fol-
lowing formula: 
 
)(* iUiLiUi XXrandXX -+¬              (8) 
 
lowlowhigh XXX *r+=                     (9) 
 
, where [ iLX , iUX ] represents the boundary of the search 
space of the optimization problem, ]1,0[Îrand , and r  
is a random noise drawn from normal distribution 
),0( sN , for example s =0.1. The objective of the pro-
posed shrinkage operator is therefore to re-generate new 
individuals (excluding lowX ) around the best fit indi-
vidual for further evolution.  
IV. HYBRIDATION OF PSO AND THE ENHANCED 
NM SEARCH SCHEME 
Hybrid NM-PSO-CENTER optimization method has 
been proved that center particle in a swarm of a PSO 
algorithm plays a critical role during the optimization 
process, where the position and velocity of the center 
particle can be calculated according to the following 
formula [20]:

Because of its significance, the center particle is 
generally closer to the optimum than Gbest during the 
search [20]. More importantly, due to frequent appear-
ance as the best particle of swarm, it often attracts other 
particles and guides the search direction of the whole 
swarm. Eventually, the swarm statistically converges to 
the center particle through iterations. Taking advantage 
of this statistical characteristic, we will have the center 
particle incorporated into the hybrid optimization 
scheme, NM-PSO-C, for evolution as depicted in Fig. 2. 
The rationale of the proposed approach is that we use 
PSO for exploration search and the enhanced NM sim-
plex search for exploitation search. A total of P particles 
are used by PSO in the proposed approach. Extra N 
points are generated around Gbest  to generate a sim-
plex of (N+1) vertex points for the enhanced NM sim-
plex search method as an attempt to offer a thorough 
exploitation in the promising direction along the best 
solution Gbest  so far obtained. By doing so, we can 
achieve the objective of using fewer particles to locate the 
global optima. For each iteration, position and velocity 
of the center particle in the swarm can be calculated via 
Eqs. (10) and (11) for replacing particle m which pos-
sesses poorer fitness in the swarm. As a result of the

B. Performance comparison    
Simulation results by optimizing the 18 benchmark 
functions via various approaches, including NM, PSO, 
GA, and NM-PSO-C, are listed in Table 2. It is clear that 
PSO has better successful rate than NM as expected. 
However, PSO is more costly in terms function evalua-
tions. As an average, NM, PSO, and GA have achieved 
successful rates of 64%, 80%, and 81%, respectively, for 
the 18 benchmark functions. This suffices to prove that 
NM-PSO-C has a better optimization performance than 
the other approaches.  
To further evaluate the performance of the optimiza-
tion schemes, the proposed NM-PSO-C is compared 
with six existing algorithms listed in Table 3 in opti-
mizing nine benchmark functions. 100 runs are per-
formed for each test function by an individual optimi-
zation scheme to ensure a consistent and fair compara-
tive evaluation. Table 2 shows the comparison results in 
terms of averaged objective function evaluations for 
various evolutionary algorithms on the basis of 100 
successful runs. Basically, all the optimization methods 
achieve 100% successful rate satisfying a pre-defined 
accuracy of 410-=e  in Eq. (13) except those marked in 
dash line (‘---‘), which are not available from the lit-
erature [22]. As demonstrated in Table 4, the proposed 
NM-PSO-C out-performs the other 6 optimization 
methods with fewer objective function evaluations for 
the benchmark functions in most cases, which once 
again validates the proposed hybrid approach is a more 
robust global optimizer in comparison to the other 
methods. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presented hybrid optimization methods 
based on PSO with the incorporation of an enhanced NM 
simplex search method and center particle of a swarm to 
improve optimization performance. Thanks to the in-
corporation of the proposed continuous expansion and 
perturbed shrinkage operators into the NM simplex 
search method, optimization can be directed toward a 
promising direction in a more effective way for locating 
a desired solution. By further incorporating the en-
hanced NM simplex search method and center particle 
into PSO for evolution, the hybrid optimization schemes 
proposed in this paper have demonstrated their superi-
ority in exploitative and explorative search to locate a 
desired global optimal solution. Simulation results in 
optimizing the benchmark functions have shown that the 
proposed hybrid optimization schemes out-perform the 
conventional PSO and other PSO variants with better 
convergence and accuracy. In light of the satisfactory 
results obtained in optimizing the benchmark functions, 
we plan to apply the proposed optimization methods to 
deal with practical applications of more complex nature 
with higher dimensions to further validate their feasi-
bility in solving practical engineering problems in the 
near future.
