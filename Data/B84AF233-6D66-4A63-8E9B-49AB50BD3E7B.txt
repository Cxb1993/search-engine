model)可類比為電氣電感-電阻-電容網路，再利用相量
分析作頻率掃瞄（Frequency Scanning）[21]即可求出渦
輪機之振模頻率及穩態時振動轉矩。首先將單位標么
E/M 激擾轉矩源而施加於發電機轉子。分析時激擾源
頻率由 0.01 Hz 逐漸增至 120 Hz，間隔 0.01 Hz，可求
得各轉軸及葉片之轉矩頻率響應。表 2 為渦輪機振模
列表，其由圖 6 之低速轉軸(Hub-GB)、高速轉軸(GB-
GEN)及葉片(WT Blade)頻率掃瞄響應得，可發現三個
振模頻率皆已避開系統頻率及二倍系統頻率之±5%之禁
止頻帶。各構件對於一般線路故障中系統頻率(60Hz)及
負序電流二倍頻(120Hz)激擾，已無明顯的響應，然而
對於功率低頻脈動-單向成份之激擾，卻有相當可觀的
響應，因其接近風渦輪機最具代表性的振模 mode 
1(2.34Hz)，故必須注意其低頻功率搖擺，必須遠離此
一頻率，否則恐有引發風渦輪機構件之機電低頻共
振。其中高速轉軸較低速轉軸、葉片有最高的響應，
故將產生最嚴重的扭轉振動轉矩。

IV. 時域分析 
 
本節將模擬六種事件。故障點皆令於輸電線中點
處，分別模擬激起於渦輪機高低轉軸及葉片上之扭轉
振動轉矩，於0.1秒時加入故障，觀察電磁轉矩(TE/M)、
高速轉軸(TGB-GEN)，低速轉軸(THub-GB)及葉片(TBlade)之
暫態響應。 
 
A. 持續型與短暫型三相故障之比較: 
 
假設發生三相短路接地故障，圖7為斷路器未執行
清除動作之暫態響應，將成為持續型故障，圖8為故障
點0.2秒自行清除之暫態響應，此為短暫型故障。持續
型故障將造成發電機過速；而短暫型得以使發電機減
速，以維持暫態穩定運轉。 
於穩態時，各葉片及轉軸傳遞之功率分別約為
0.33及1.0 p.u.。故障初期，其電磁轉矩由步級單向成
份及系統頻率成份所主導，符合III.A節推論，其高速
轉軸因頻域分析中21.31Hz振模高響應效應，故有轉矩
振動模式中有明顯此一成份。然而因步階單向成份將
導致各構件主要振模為2.34Hz之振動模式，故所有傳
動鏈元件必須注意此一振動之大小，以避免產生高應
力疲勞振動。尤其清除故障後再次造成功率步級上
昇，將造成再一次的單向成份激擾，此時各構件振動
轉矩將再次放大。 
整體而言，轉矩於高速轉軸，高於低速轉軸，再
高於葉片，符合頻率掃瞄分析之結果。

英文：Wind energy is one of the most popular and economic renewable energy 
generations. According to the statistics, there is about 3GW wind energy power 
potentially in Taiwan. If the grid-connected wind turbine generator is subjected to 
the network faults, the induced electromagnetic torque gives rise to torsional 
torque stresses on turbine drive train components, namely blades and high/low 
speed shafts. This project employs a single induction machine-infinite system of 
middle voltage level containing a fixed-speed wind turbine, in order to investigate 
the wind turbine torque behaviors owing to network faults. From the simulation 
results, it is found that all the turbine components are sensitive to unidirectional 
component excitation (the real power pulsation). Therefore, the worst-case impact 
is simulated and resulted from three-phase-to-ground fault. The auto-reclosing 
circuit breaker next to wind power plants should be disable in order to ensure 
long-term safety operation.

Abstract—Due to a restricted right-of-way and many factors, 
some of the local areas in Taiwan have become increasingly 
difficult to build new transmission lines. Since the majority of 
Taiwan power loads are located in the Norton, the demand of 
promoting transmission power could be of great urgency owing 
to the large amounts of power transferring from the South to the 
Norton. Aimed at overcoming this problem without changing the 
original conductors of the double-circuit transmission lines, the 
six-phase transmission scheme which could be one of the best 
schemes is presented and has several advantages such as 
transient stability enhancement, minimal corona, electric and 
magnetic fields, and radio interferences. As a result of the 
successful commercial operation of six-phase transmissions, the 
utility planner inevitably faces with the issue for the impact of 
turbine-generator torsional vibrations in the initial stage of the 
expansion into the a six-phase network. From the simulation 
comparisons between the three-phase double-circuit and evolved 
six-phase system, the latter offers better stability characteristic 
without deteriorating torsional vibrations from the viewpoint of 
the same line voltages. For the case of the same transmission 
capability, it significantly reduces the torsional vibrations. These 
conclusions provide a constructive suggestion for the department 
of generation and transmission.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
There are three nuclear power plants in Taiwan, which 
serve as base-load units and began their operation in 1977. 
According to statistics for these plants, a total of 46, 68 and 62 
incidents have occurred in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. 
Among these, up to 10 incidents (induced from either typhoons 
or earthquakes) even caused tower collapse and serious 
disconnection between the northern and southern subsystem, 
incurring considerable financial expense to reconstruct the 
transmission system. Six-phase transmission technique allows 
the towers to be built smaller and more compactly than the 
three-phase one for the same power flow capability, effectively 
lessening the right-of-way problem without changing existing 
conductors. The cost saving could be recycled to strengthen the 
tower against collapse.  
Under the assumption of the same line-to-line voltage, the 
six-phase transmission needs equal space of right-of-way and 
can carry up to 73% more power than a conventional double 
circuit three-phase line. In 1992, the high phase order 
transmission demonstration project converted NYSEG’s 115 
kV double circuit short line between Goudey and Oakdale into 
a 93 kV six-phase line [1]. The power flow capability of such a 
system could be increased by 40%. Subsequently, numerous 
studies have been presented and attention has become focused 
on the system protection [2-3] and fault analysis [4-6]. 
Recently, there has been new interest in torsional interaction 
between this system and turbine-generator shafts [6]. However, 
it lacks for discussing the turbine blade torsional torques, 
stability, and comparison under the identical line voltage.  
To investigate these effects is the motivation behind the 
development of our article. From the simulation result, it is 
found that the six-phase system effectively lessens the torsional 
interaction under various transmission line faults. A transient 
computer program is developed by using Matlab-Power System 
Blockset [7]. 
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS 
A. System Model 
The existing three-phase system used for investigation of 
this paper is shown in Figure 1(a). It consists of a turbine-
generator connected via step-up and -down transformers to an 
infinite bus network system through a three-phase, 345 kV 
double-circuit transmission line. The converted six-phase 
system, shown in Figure 1(b), consists of the same turbine-
generator connected via two pairs of phase conversion 
transformers to an infinite bus network system through a six-
phase transmission line. One pair of phase converter 
transformers is connected wye/delta and the other pair is 
connected inverted wye/delta. Therefore, the 60-degree phase 
shift between adjacent phases is obtained. The phase diagrams 
for the studied three-phase double-circuit and six-phase 
systems are plotted in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. It is 
apparent that the line-to-line voltage magnitude of the six-
phase system is the same as its phase voltage magnitude.

IV. TIME-DOMAIN SIMULATION RESULTS  
There are 11 and 120 possible fault combinations in a three-
phase and six-phase system respectively. Out of these large 
combinations, there are 5 and 23 combinations respectively, 
with distinct fault levels and phase interconnections [9]. To 
compare the impact on the turbine-generator set, the significant 
fault combinations are tabulated in the third column of Table 3 
for a six-phase system, and in the fourth column for a three-
phase double circuit system, where the phase numbers are 
defined in Figure 3. Assume that the steady-state condition 
occurs at 0 second. Thus, the transient responses of six-phase 
phase voltage and phase current shown in Figure 5 agree with 
the phase relationship. In the following subsections, the fault is 
applied to the middle location (location P) of the transmission 
line at 0.1 second.

A. Short-time Line Faults 
A.1 Transient Stability Comparison 
In the past, power accidents occurring as three-phase-to-
ground faults were believed to induce the largest torsional 
stresses [10]. The peak-to-peak (deviation between maximum 
and minimum) shaft and blade torques are plotted in Figure 6 
as functions of the three-phase-to-ground (abc-G) fault self-
clearing time. It can be seen that the fault clearing time affects 
the peak-to-peak torsional torques due to the phase additive or 
subtractive effect at the instant of clearing time. There are 
similar sensitivity characteristics for the peak-to-peak torque 
curve between the three- and six-phase systems and their 
worst-case clearing time is 0.19 second (5.4 cycles). The 
transient behaviors subjected to a worst-case three-phase-to-
ground fault are indicated in Figure 7(a) for the three-phase 
double circuit system, and in Figure 7(b) for the six-phase 
system with identical line-to-line voltage (345kV). Obviously, 
the six-phase system offers better transient stability 
characteristics than the conventional three-phase double-circuit 
system on account of the increment of 73% power flow 
capability. The damping on the rotor angle helps validate this 
assertion.

A.2 Torsional Torque Level Comparison 
Since the faulted armature current in the six-phase system 
has been restricted, the induced E/M torque can be alleviated. 
This contributes to the turbine shaft and blade torsional torque 
suppression as Figure 8(b) shows. If all the peak-to-peak 
torques from the curve in Figure 6 are averaged, the average 
peak-to-peak torque (Tpp) under the case of abc-G is derived 
and defined. It should be noted that between these two systems, 
symmetrical faults (such as abc, abc-G, 6L, and 6LG) bring the 
same torsional impact, and a 1L-G fault in the six-phase system 
can induce torsional torques higher than those induced due to a 
2L fault. Besides, a 4L (aca’c’) fault in the three-phase system 
imposes the highest stresses on blades rather than shafts. This is 
because considerable negative-sequence current penetrates 
through the generator, which induces supersynchronous 
oscillations. Fortunately as can be seen from the double-system 
component of E/M torque, six-phase system also mitigates the 
negative-sequence armature current and then reduces this 
phenomenon. 
Further Table 4 averages these torque levels from 23 types 
of faults. As compared from the table, the six-phase network 
faults impose minor torsional stresses especially on turbine 
blades based on the same peak-to-peak voltage (the same right-
of-way).  
It is worth noting that as mentioned in [11], the most 
common type of fault in a three-phase system is the single line-
to-ground (1L-G) fault, followed in frequency of occurrence by 
line-to-line (2L) fault, double line-to-ground (2L-G) faults, and 
three-phase (3L) faults. This means that in a six-phase system, 
the higher phase faults lead to having a much lower probability 
of occurrence. Consequently, aimed at the excitations of line 
faults below three phases (e.g. 1L-G, …, 3L, 3L-G), the torque 
2963
          
transient responses involving with armature current during 
worst-case unsuccessful reclosing of a 5.4-60-5.4 cycle’s single 
line-to-ground fault occurred are indicated in Figure 10(a) for 
the three-phase system, in Figure 10(b) for the six-phase 
system with the same line-to-line voltage, and Figure 10(c) for 
the six-phase system with the same phase voltage. As can be 
anticipated, the 345kV six-phase system possesses the best 
stability performance and stability margin. Even after a three-
pole tripping during unsuccessful reclosing (>1.29 sec), the 345 
kV six-phase system becomes the original three-phase single-
circuit system. However, at this instant, the 199 kV six-phase 
system becomes a 199kV three-phase single-circuit system and 
leads to a rapid rotor acceleration because of the effect of 
double transmission impedance. Converting a system with less 
right-of-way consideration is against system stability margin.  
B.2 Torsional Torque Level Comparison 
As a result of the effective reduction for the single line-to-
ground fault current as evidenced by armature current in 
Figures 10(b) and 10(c), there are smaller induced 
abovementioned three components of E/M torque. Thereby, the 
shafts and blades suffer inconsiderable vibrations especially for 
the 199kV six-phase system. Besides, during the dead time 
between single-pole tripping and line reclosing, the negative 
sequence current gives rise to the E/M torque with the double 
system frequency component which may stimulate turbine 
blades [8]. In the figures, they reveal that, during the dead time, 
the six-phase system injects more negative sequence currents to 
the generators as the voltages decreases. But fortunately, the 
onerous supersynchronous oscillation in turbine blades is not 
induced since the vibration modes stay away from the 
forbidden band of double system frequency. The effectiveness 
of restricting blade vibrations is still guaranteed. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
1. Under the assumption of identical line-to-line voltage, there 
are a 25% torque reduction for the turbine blades on average 
following various line faults and considerable stability 
improvement in the six-phase system. Under the assumption of 
identical transmission capability, there is up to 40% torque 
decrement on turbine shafts and blades. 
2. For the most frequent fault of the single line-to-ground fault, 
the six-phase system induces more significant negative-
sequence current during the dead time and stability margin 
reduction problem under single-circuit line tripping. However, 
the torsional torque suppression on either blades or shafts is 
still effective and satisfying.

Abstract—Due to a restricted right-of-way and many factors, 
some of the local areas in Taiwan have become increasingly 
difficult to build new transmission lines. Since the majority of 
Taiwan power loads are located in the Norton, the demand of 
promoting transmission power could be of great urgency owing 
to the large amounts of power transferring from the South to the 
Norton. Aimed at overcoming this problem without changing the 
original conductors of the double-circuit transmission lines, the 
six-phase transmission scheme which could be one of the best 
schemes is presented and has several advantages such as 
transient stability enhancement, minimal corona, electric and 
magnetic fields, and radio interferences. As a result of the 
successful commercial operation of six-phase transmissions, the 
utility planner inevitably faces with the issue for the impact of 
turbine-generator torsional vibrations in the initial stage of the 
expansion into the a six-phase network. From the simulation 
comparisons between the three-phase double-circuit and evolved 
six-phase system, the latter offers better stability characteristic 
without deteriorating torsional vibrations from the viewpoint of 
the same line voltages. For the case of the same transmission 
capability, it significantly reduces the torsional vibrations. These 
conclusions provide a constructive suggestion for the department 
of generation and transmission.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
There are three nuclear power plants in Taiwan, which 
serve as base-load units and began their operation in 1977. 
According to statistics for these plants, a total of 46, 68 and 62 
incidents have occurred in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. 
Among these, up to 10 incidents (induced from either typhoons 
or earthquakes) even caused tower collapse and serious 
disconnection between the northern and southern subsystem, 
incurring considerable financial expense to reconstruct the 
transmission system. Six-phase transmission technique allows 
the towers to be built smaller and more compactly than the 
three-phase one for the same power flow capability, effectively 
lessening the right-of-way problem without changing existing 
conductors. The cost saving could be recycled to strengthen the 
tower against collapse.  
Under the assumption of the same line-to-line voltage, the 
six-phase transmission needs equal space of right-of-way and 
can carry up to 73% more power than a conventional double 
circuit three-phase line. In 1992, the high phase order 
transmission demonstration project converted NYSEG’s 115 
kV double circuit short line between Goudey and Oakdale into 
a 93 kV six-phase line [1]. The power flow capability of such a 
system could be increased by 40%. Subsequently, numerous 
studies have been presented and attention has become focused 
on the system protection [2-3] and fault analysis [4-6]. 
Recently, there has been new interest in torsional interaction 
between this system and turbine-generator shafts [6]. However, 
it lacks for discussing the turbine blade torsional torques, 
stability, and comparison under the identical line voltage.  
To investigate these effects is the motivation behind the 
development of our article. From the simulation result, it is 
found that the six-phase system effectively lessens the torsional 
interaction under various transmission line faults. A transient 
computer program is developed by using Matlab-Power System 
Blockset [7]. 
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS 
A. System Model 
The existing three-phase system used for investigation of 
this paper is shown in Figure 1(a). It consists of a turbine-
generator connected via step-up and -down transformers to an 
infinite bus network system through a three-phase, 345 kV 
double-circuit transmission line. The converted six-phase 
system, shown in Figure 1(b), consists of the same turbine-
generator connected via two pairs of phase conversion 
transformers to an infinite bus network system through a six-
phase transmission line. One pair of phase converter 
transformers is connected wye/delta and the other pair is 
connected inverted wye/delta. Therefore, the 60-degree phase 
shift between adjacent phases is obtained. The phase diagrams 
for the studied three-phase double-circuit and six-phase 
systems are plotted in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. It is 
apparent that the line-to-line voltage magnitude of the six-
phase system is the same as its phase voltage magnitude.

IV. TIME-DOMAIN SIMULATION RESULTS  
There are 11 and 120 possible fault combinations in a three-
phase and six-phase system respectively. Out of these large 
combinations, there are 5 and 23 combinations respectively, 
with distinct fault levels and phase interconnections [9]. To 
compare the impact on the turbine-generator set, the significant 
fault combinations are tabulated in the third column of Table 3 
for a six-phase system, and in the fourth column for a three-
phase double circuit system, where the phase numbers are 
defined in Figure 3. Assume that the steady-state condition 
occurs at 0 second. Thus, the transient responses of six-phase 
phase voltage and phase current shown in Figure 5 agree with 
the phase relationship. In the following subsections, the fault is 
applied to the middle location (location P) of the transmission 
line at 0.1 second.

A. Short-time Line Faults 
A.1 Transient Stability Comparison 
In the past, power accidents occurring as three-phase-to-
ground faults were believed to induce the largest torsional 
stresses [10]. The peak-to-peak (deviation between maximum 
and minimum) shaft and blade torques are plotted in Figure 6 
as functions of the three-phase-to-ground (abc-G) fault self-
clearing time. It can be seen that the fault clearing time affects 
the peak-to-peak torsional torques due to the phase additive or 
subtractive effect at the instant of clearing time. There are 
similar sensitivity characteristics for the peak-to-peak torque 
curve between the three- and six-phase systems and their 
worst-case clearing time is 0.19 second (5.4 cycles). The 
transient behaviors subjected to a worst-case three-phase-to-
ground fault are indicated in Figure 7(a) for the three-phase 
double circuit system, and in Figure 7(b) for the six-phase 
system with identical line-to-line voltage (345kV). Obviously, 
the six-phase system offers better transient stability 
characteristics than the conventional three-phase double-circuit 
system on account of the increment of 73% power flow 
capability. The damping on the rotor angle helps validate this 
assertion.

fault clearing time for a three-to-ground fault (a) three-phase double-circuit 
system (345kV) (b) six-phase system with the same line-to-line voltage 
(345kV) 
 
A.2 Torsional Torque Level Comparison 
Since the faulted armature current in the six-phase system 
has been restricted, the induced E/M torque can be alleviated. 
This contributes to the turbine shaft and blade torsional torque 
suppression as Figure 8(b) shows. If all the peak-to-peak 
torques from the curve in Figure 6 are averaged, the average 
peak-to-peak torque (Tpp) under the case of abc-G is derived 
and defined. It should be noted that between these two systems, 
symmetrical faults (such as abc, abc-G, 6L, and 6LG) bring the 
same torsional impact, and a 1L-G fault in the six-phase system 
can induce torsional torques higher than those induced due to a 
2L fault. Besides, a 4L (aca’c’) fault in the three-phase system 
imposes the highest stresses on blades rather than shafts. This is 
because considerable negative-sequence current penetrates 
through the generator, which induces supersynchronous 
oscillations. Fortunately as can be seen from the double-system 
component of E/M torque, six-phase system also mitigates the 
negative-sequence armature current and then reduces this 
phenomenon. 
Further Table 4 averages these torque levels from 23 types 
of faults. As compared from the table, the six-phase network 
faults impose minor torsional stresses especially on turbine 
blades based on the same peak-to-peak voltage (the same right-
of-way).  
It is worth noting that as mentioned in [11], the most 
common type of fault in a three-phase system is the single line-
to-ground (1L-G) fault, followed in frequency of occurrence by 
line-to-line (2L) fault, double line-to-ground (2L-G) faults, and 
three-phase (3L) faults. This means that in a six-phase system, 
the higher phase faults lead to having a much lower probability 
of occurrence. Consequently, aimed at the excitations of line 
faults below three phases (e.g. 1L-G, …, 3L, 3L-G), the torque
