3experimental [11]–[21]. They observed an in-plane anisotropy
polarization feature by photoluminescence and electrolumi-
nescence measurements [11], [15]–[19], [21], which are not
observed in 푐-plane quantum well. The theoretical studies have
also shown the anisotropy strain effect in nonpolar quantum
well, which leads to the modification of valence band structure
[22]. This modification will directly affect the polarization
properties of the emitted light [5], [23].
As we know, the quantum well width has a strong relation to
the quantum confinement effect. There is a stronger quantum
confinement in a narrower quantum well width. Due to the
absence of QCSE in the nonpolar InGaN quantum well, it
is possible to make a wider quantum well to increase the
amount of carriers injected into the quantum well. However,
wider quantum well might reduce the energy separation of
each subband [24] so that the polarization ratio might decrease.
Also, the compressive strain induced by the lattice mismatch
is determined by the quantity of indium alloy, and as the result
the LEDs with different emission wavelengths may have dif-
ferent polarization performances. The injected carrier density
also plays an important role in determining the light emission
property. Usually, with higher carrier injection density, more
subbands are filled, and it reduces the polarization ratio as
well. Therefore, the polarization ratio also has a strong relation
with carrier injection density in the quantum well [19].
In this work, we applied a self-consistent Poisson and
6×6 푘 ⋅ 푝 Schro¨dinger method [25], [26] to solve the band
structure, energy subband levels and wave functions. The strain
deformation effect is also considered here. We varied different
quantum well widths and indium compositions to design our
푎-plane and semipolar InGaN quantum well, and studied the
polarization light emission properties under different carrier
injection conditions.

IV. RESULTS
The light emission in the semiconductor material is gener-
ated by the electron transition from the conduction band to
the valence band. As we know, the conduction band is mainly
formed by the ∣푠⟩ core state, which is a spherically symmetric
orbital. The valence bands are mainly formed by the ∣푝푥⟩, ∣푝푦⟩,
and ∣푝푧⟩ atomic orbitals. When the transition occurs between
the ∣푠⟩ state and ∣푝푥⟩, ∣푝푦⟩ , and ∣푝푧⟩ valence band states,
the light emission from these kinds of transitions will be 푥-
polarized, 푦-polarized, and 푧-polarized light, respectively.
In the 푐-plane InGaN/GaN quantum well system, the top-
most CH1 and CH2 states are formed by ∣푋 + 푖푌 ⟩ and
∣푋 − 푖푌 ⟩, respectively. Due to the in-plane symmetric atom
distribution in wurtzite structure, the in-plane strain of 푐-plane
InGaN/GaN quantum well is isotropic. As a result, the ∣푋⟩
state and ∣푌 ⟩ state of CH1 and CH2 bands are still equally
mixed to each other under strained condition. Hence, if we
consider the light emission toward the surface (along 푐-axis),
the emitted light would be nonpolarized since the 푥-polarized
light is equal to the 푦-polarized light.

Fig. 1. The valence band structure under strained condition of 푎-plane bulk
In0.2Ga0.8N material along (a) the 푘′푧 direction and the 푘′푦 direction and (b)
along the 푘′푦 direction and the 푘′푥 direction.
However, if we rotate the growth direction to the nonpolar 푎-
plane orientation, the in-plane strain will become anisotropic.
Due to the anisotropic strain, the original ∣푋 + 푖푌 ⟩ and
∣푋−푖푌 ⟩ states are separated into ∣푋⟩-like and ∣푌 ⟩-like states.
It is important to note that since the valence band structure
is strongly modified, the ∣푌 ⟩(∣푌 ′⟩)-like state becomes the
topmost state. Therefore, a strong polarized light emission
will be measured at the growth direction (along 푥(푧′)-axis).
Also, in order to achieve larger polarization ratio, we need to
control the energy separation of ∣푌 ⟩(∣푌 ′⟩)-like and ∣푍⟩(∣푋 ′⟩)-
like states as large as possible.
As mentioned earlier, the quantum well width strongly af-
fects the energy separation of the different states. The influence
of the energy separation with different quantum well width is
depending on the effective mass along the growth direction.
Figure 1 shows the calculated valence band structure of 푎-
plane bulk In0.2Ga0.8N material with 6×6 푘 ⋅ 푝 method. The
effects of biaxial strain for In0.2Ga0.8N grown on GaN is
considered here. Figure 1 (a) shows the 퐸-푘 curve along the
푘′푧 and 푘
′
푦 directions. We can find that due to the asymmetric
strain, the ∣푍 ′⟩-like state is lowering down, which has much
smaller effective mass along the 푘′푧 direction. The ∣푌 ′⟩-like
and ∣푋 ′⟩-like states are stayed at the top. The effective mass
of the ∣푋 ′⟩-like state (∼ 1.176m0) is slightly smaller than
that of the ∣푌 ′⟩-like state (∼ 1.731m0) along the 푘′푧 direction.
Therefore, we can expect that after making the quantum well,
the ∣푌 ′⟩-like and ∣푋 ′⟩-like states will remain on top since they
have larger effective mass along the 푘′푧 direction compared to

continues to increase, [28] as shown in Fig. 3 (a). Hence, the
푦′-polarized light emitted from the transition between ∣푆⟩-state
and ∣푌 ′⟩-state is dominant. As a result, the polarization ratio
increases as indium composition increases, as shown in Fig.
3 (b).
We also compared our simulation results with published
experimental works. Most experimental works on polarization
ratio studies are mainly for 푚-plane [16]–[19] and few works
on 푎-plane [21]. It is noted that the difference between 푚-
plane and 푎-plane InGaN quantum well is that ∣푋⟩-like state
will lift up for 푚-plane, and ∣푌 ⟩-like state will lift up for
푎-plane. However, the polarization ratio changes will be the
same. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), the polarization ratio of the
experimental results for 푚-plane monotonically increases with
the indium composition, as predicted by our calculation. For
the 푎-plane results, the polarization ratio for samples with
9% and 14% indium composition is close to our prediction.
However, the polarization ratio does not increase with the
indium composition due to the growth quality of samples,
where In-clustering localized states are formed. As mentioned
in Ref. [21], the growth quality for 푎-plane InGaN quantum
well still needs improvements. Finally, it is worth noting that
in experiments, the actual carrier density in the quantum well
may not be the same as that used in calculations, and therefore
the measured and calculated polarization ratios will not be
exactly the same.
Figure 4 (a) shows the change in polarization ratio and
Fermi level versus injection carrier density. Figure 4 (b) shows

the emission spectrum of different polarized light with differ-
ent injection conditions. Even though it does not modify the
valence band structure too much by increasing injection carrier
density, it affects the population of carriers in each subband.
When more carriers are injected into the quantum well, the
higher energy states are filled with carriers. As a result, there
are more carriers being filled in ∣푋 ′⟩-like state under the high
injection condition compared to the low injection condition.
The 푥′-polarized light component increases as the carrier
injection density increases, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). Therefore,
the polarization ratio decreases under high carrier injection
condition. Similar effects are also observed by experimental
results [19].
Figure 5 shows the valence band structure of
In0.2Ga0.8N/GaN 푎-plane quantum well along the 푘′푦
and the 푘′푥 directions. As mentioned before, the energy
separation of the two topmost states is strongly related to the
strain and quantum confinement effect, which will modify
the valence band structure. It can be seen that the energy
separation of the 푎-plane quantum well valence band structure
is larger than that for the conventional 푐-plane quantum well.
Also, we can find the asymmetric behavior along the 푘′푦
and 푘′푥 directions. For the first and the second subbands
(∣푌 ′⟩-like state), the effective masses are large along the 푘′푥
direction and much smaller along the 푘′푦 direction. However,
for the third subband (∣푋 ′⟩-like state), the effective mass is
large along the 푘′푦 direction and much smaller along the 푘
′
푥
direction. Therefore, along the 푘′푦 direction, there are two
interception points at 푘′푦 close to 0.008 A˚
−1 and 0.044 A˚−1,
respectively. Hence, when carriers are filling the ground state
with larger 푘′푦 value, the ground state will become ∣푋 ′⟩-like
state dominated. Along the 푘′푥 direction, since the ∣푋 ′⟩-like
state has smaller effective mass, the polarization ratio will be
greatly enhanced when the carrier filling the larger 푘′푥 states.
Figure 6 (a) shows the optical matrix element of ∣푦′⟩
and ∣푥′⟩ components in the first subband versus 푘′푥. As
mentioned earlier, the optical matrix element of 푦′-polarized
light increases as the 푘′푥 increases. On the other hand, the
optical matrix element of 푥′-polarized light decreases as the
푘′푥 increases. However, due to the mixing between the topmost

orientations are dominated by ∣푌 ′⟩-like state as shown in Fig.
8 (c), 8 (d), and 8 (e). Hence, the results suggest that these
crystal growth orientations including nonpolar orientations
mentioned earlier have great potential to be a good polarized
light emitters.
Figure 9 (a) and 9 (b) show the change of effective mass
ratio and energy separation of In0.4Ga0.6N alloy films on GaN
substrates of CH1 to CH2 band with different crystal growth
orientations, respectively. We can find that there is a huge
enhancement in the effective mass ratio at 휃 = 28∘− 52∘ due
to the increasing of the strain effect as shown in Fig. 9 (a). It
is worth noting that there are two kinds of strains in semipolar
system, and the influences to band structure are different. The
shear strain will lift up the ∣푋 ′⟩ and ∣푍 ′⟩ states, and the normal
strain will lift up the ∣푌 ′⟩ state. It means that the two kinds
of strain effects compete with each other, and resulted the
switching of the energy band positions. From Fig. 8 and Fig.
9, we can find that there is a huge variation of the effective
mass ratio and the probability of the topmost state at 휃 =
28∘ − 52∘. The results suggest that the shear strain dominate
in high indium alloy cases. Also, the energy separation of the
CH1 and CH2 bands in 휃 = 13∘ − 40∘ increases as indium
composition increases as shown in Fig. 9 (b). Therefore, the
crystal growth orientations for 휃 = 75∘ − 90∘ and 휃 ∼ 32∘
seem to be the high potential growth orientations for high
performance polarized light source. However, the probability
of 휃 ∼ 32∘ in the CH1 band are mixed with the ∣푋 ′⟩-like and
∣푍 ′⟩-like states as shown in Fig. 9 (c), 9 (d), and 9 (e). Hence,
there is a limit of polarization ratio for the In0.4Ga0.6N layer
with the crystal growth orientation 휃 ∼ 32∘.
It is important to note that if we choose the growth ori-
entations which provide a large effective mass ratio, large
energy separation and, the pure state component of CH1 band,
the polarization ratio are expected to be a high value when
we make a quantum well along these growth orientations.
Therefore, these results suggest that we can grow a quantum
well LED along 휃 = 75∘ − 90∘ to obtain a high polarization
performance.
As mentioned earlier, the growth orientation, which rotated
휃 ∼ 32∘ away from 푐-axis, is the one of the common semipolar

planes studied in recent years, i.e., (101¯3¯) plane. Here, we
apply self-consistent Poisson and 6×6 푘 ⋅푝 Schro¨dinger solver
to calculate the semipolar (101¯3¯) InGaN/GaN quantum well
structure. Figure 10 (a) to 10 (d) show the valence band
structure of InGaN-based semipolar (101¯3¯) quantum well with
indium composition equal to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%,
respectively. We can find that the CH1 band, which is mainly
formed by ∣푌 ′⟩ state, of In0.1Ga0.9N and In0.2Ga0.8N alloy
films will be pulled down to be the second band in quantum
well structure. It is due to that the effective mass of CH1
band (∣푌 ′⟩ state) is smaller than that of the CH2 band (∼
0.6∣푋 ′⟩+0.4∣푍 ′⟩ state) in the confined direction of the quantum
well structure.
We also find that the 푥′-polarized and 푧′-polarized light are
getting stronger when the indium composition is getting larger
because there is a subband mainly formed by ∣푋 ′⟩ and ∣푍 ′⟩
states. Therefore, we define the polarization ratio as
휌 =
퐼∥ − 퐼⊥
퐼∥ + 퐼⊥
, (1)
where 퐼∥ and 퐼⊥ are the emission intensity with polarization
parallel to the 푦′-axis and perpendicular to 푦′-axis, respec-

Fig. 14. The valence band dispersion relation of the (112¯2) (intersects the 푐-
plane at 58∘) semipolar In푥Ga1−푥N/GaN quantum well. (a) x=0.1, (b) x=0.2,
(c) x=0.3, (d) x=0.4 and (e) x=0.5.
state is smaller than that of ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ state. It means that the
∣푌 ′⟩ state will be pulled down to be the second band by the
quantum confinement effect when we make a quantum well
structure. Also, the shear strain is getting dominant while the
increase of the indium composition, and lift up the ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩
state.
Here, we will discuss the optical polarization properties of
the semipolar (112¯2) quantum well, which is also a common
growth orientation of semipolar quanum well structure. In
addition, the (112¯2) plane intersects the 푐-plane at around
58∘. Here, we apply self-consistent Poisson and 6×6 푘 ⋅ 푝
Schro¨dinger solver to calculate the semipolar (112¯2) In-
GaN/GaN quantum well structure.
Figure 14 (a) to 14 (e) show the valence band structure
of InGaN-based semipolar (112¯2) quantum well with indium
composition equal to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, re-
spectively. We can find that the energy separation between
∣푌 ′⟩ subband and ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ subband is very small, especially
for the indium composition larger than 30%. It is due to that
the contribution of the shear strain effect becomes significant
in high indium composition cases. Therefore, the switching
phenomenon occurs in the indium composition equal to 50%,
it means that the ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ subband is lifted up to be the
topmost subband in the (112¯2) In0.5Ga0.5N quantum well
system.
Figure 15 (a) and 15 (b) show the the relative energy
separation of the ∣푌 ′⟩ subband to the ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ subband
and the polarization ratios of InGaN/GaN (112¯2) semipolar
quantum well as a function of the indium composition. It
is noted that the relative energy separation is defined as the
difference from the ∣푌 ′⟩ subband to the ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ subband.

Fig. 15. (a) The relative energy separation of (112¯2) InGaN/GaN quantum
well structure and the strained InGaN alloy film as a function of indium
composition, respectively. Noted that the relative energy separation is defined
as the difference from the ∣푌 ′⟩ subband to the ∣푋′⟩+∣푍′⟩ subband. (b) The
polarization ratios of InGaN/GaN (112¯2) quantum well as a function of indium
composition.
However, since the shear strain becomes dominant as the
indium composition increases as mentioned before, the relative
energy separation decreases as indium composition increases.
It is noted that the relative energy separation of indium
composition equal to 20% is slightly larger than 10% due
to the crystal-field energy (Δ1) of InN is larger than that of
GaN. Also, since the difference of the effective mass of the
two subband states is small, the relative energy separation of
quantum well is similar to that of the strained alloy film.
From Fig. 15 (b), we can find that the polarization ratios
decrease as the indium composition increases due to the 푥′-
polarization and 푧′-polarization components become stronger.
Also, the polarization switching phenomenon occur in indium
composition equal to 50%, it have shown a good agreement
with some published experimental works [30].
Figure 16 (a) and 16 (b) show the relative energy separation
and the polarization ratios a function of well width. As
mentioned earlier, the effective mass of ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ subband
is slightly larger than that of ∣푌 ′⟩ subband. It means that
the quantum confinement effect will make the two subbands
closer. Therefore, the relative energy separation increases as
well width increases. However, since the variation of the
energy separation is quite small, the variations of the polariza-
tion ratios are small as well. The polarization ratios slightly
increase as well width increases due to the energy difference
between the ∣푌 ′⟩ subband and the ∣푋 ′⟩+∣푍 ′⟩ subband becomes

VIII. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have studied the several properties of the
valence band structure with different crystal growth orienta-
tions, and also calculated the polarization ratios of semipolar
(101¯3¯), (112¯2), and 휃=75∘ InGaN/GaN quantum well. The key
issues of designing a semipolar quantum well as a polarized
light source are the effective mass, energy separation, and the
probability of the topmost band. In order to achieve the larger
polarization ratio, we need to optimize these factors to figure
out which growth orientation is the best for making a polarized
light source. Our results suggest that the optimized growth
orientation is around 휃 = 75∘ − 90∘ which may have the
better polarization light emission performance.

一、參加會議經過 
The conference on Laser and Electro-Optoelectronics is mainly focused on the issues on newly 
developed laser applications, biomedical, and solid state lighting. The purpose of joining to this 
conference is to present two of our current work on nitride LEDs. On Monday morning, my 
student Hung-Hsun Huang presented his paper “Light Emission Polarization Properties of 
A-Plane InGaN/GaN Quantum Wells Light Emitting Diodes” in oral presentation. Our work has 
attracted a lot of attentions and some people asked questions after the presentation. The 
morning’s section is mainly focused the polarization properties of nitride LED. Prof. James 
Speck, who is a famous professor in UCSB gave a very good tutorial talk on the state of art 
device achievement and issues. There was a whole session on Monday presenting the nitride 
solid state light.  
The second day still had a section on solid state lighting. Many famous professors such as 
Prof. Schubert from RPI came to give an invited talk. There are also some companies good in 
this field such as Cree and Philips gave very impressive talks in their achievements. Some 
interesting works such as using InGaN buffer layer to overcome the green barrier in LEDs are 
also very interesting to me. On Wednesday morning, there are two plenary talks which present 
the state of art progress on quantum cascade laser and quantum computing, which are believed 
to be a challenge in the future engineering works for Tera-Hertz source and powerful 
computing. At noon is the poster session and my student Cheng-Yu Chang was presenting his 
work on “Etching Depth Dependence of Emission Properties from InGaN/GaN Light Emitting 
Diodes with Nanohole Arrays: Analysis of Strain Relaxation and Surface States”. On Thursday, 
the topics on solid state lighting had ended. But there were still many interesting topics on 
going. There is a section on Laser TV where many companies are invited to give a talk for the 
possible applications such as using RGB laser as portable projector for the cell-phone or used 
as a very large size TV (larger than hundred square inches. On Friday, we flied home.
