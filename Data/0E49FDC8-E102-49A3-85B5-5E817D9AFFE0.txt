ABSTRACT：  
Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) is electrically conducting in the vertical direction (Z-axis) 
and insulating in the horizontal. ACF looks like paper and consists of thermosetting adhesive, 
conductive particles, and release. The particles are randomly distributed in the compound before 
processing, forced flow in the squeeze flowing during thermo-compression forming processing, and 
fixed between the bumps and pads. The major motive in this research is for the bonding demands of 
the LCD and soft electrics in the fine-pitch, high I/Os, high anti-tensile, high anti-shear, high 
anti-bending, high anti-fatigue, and high reliability. The traditional ACF cannot satisfy these critical 
requirements. Hence, we will try to design, develop and manufacture the multi-layered composite 
Anisotropic Conductive Film in this year project. The project will carry out about compound 
characteristics, flowing, curing, contact, stress analysis, and reliability.  In this year, the research 
works are to characterize the compound of the single- and multi- layered ACF, to derive reliability 
methods, and to measure the parameters of the multi-layered composite ACF. The theoretical, 
numerical, experiment and processing analysis will be carried out in the scheme.  The major 
contributions in this year are the new bridging model developed and the misalignments analyzed.   
 
Keywords: flip-chip packaging, multi-layered composite ACF, conductive particle, insulating 
particle, thermo-compression forming, failure probability, particles-reinforcement, warpage, 
reliability.

目前進度已開發完成以亂數作多層材料試件分析成果，其計算流程圖如圖三，程式之輸出/輸
入畫面如圖四所示。 
三、實驗分析 
在強度方面測試 
  目前以 PMMA 為上下基板之材料，將晶片尺寸設計為 10000μm x10000μm 也就是 1cm2，
在其上製作導電電極陣列，單一電極之面積設定 500μm x 500μm 、200μm x 200μm 、100μm 
x 100μm 或 50μm x 50μm，再取以適當之間距(pitch) 500μm 、200μm 、100μm 或 50μm，及
設計導電電極之厚度 100μm、50μm、20μm 或 10μm，設計製造多組實驗對照組，做導電薄
膜之熱壓合成型接合，準備做相關測試。藉由 PMMA 的透光性嘗試去顯示接合完成後之殘餘
應力分析。 
材料分析 
    對於所設計配方之混膠的過程中，膠體與顆粒體積分率的重量精度十分重要，因為體積
分率的值來自導電顆粒密度的換算，另一方面混膠的技術也是重點，目前正嘗試自行搭配，
在技術上尚需學習與準備。目前，暫時不考慮直接混膠的技術問題。初步的試驗是採用 ACF(已
知體積分率、厚度及顆粒大小)與 NCF(已知厚度之非導電膠膜)作搭配，得到十個實驗對照組。
這十組對照組在多層(含兩種以上基材膠體)中，以含顆粒層膠體及與純膠體層作搭配形成各
組實驗對照組。目前為進度嘗試作前五組，即不含絕緣顆粒的導電薄模配方。某些含單層顆
粒層厚度之 ACF，是由市購規格品經等溫壓縮(以原本保存溫度下做壓模成形)而得到單層含
膠顆粒層。 
                                           
4 / 27
由複合材料的觀點，含導電顆粒的熱傳導性應該比純膠材要佳，但是定量上的結果還
是必須做 DSC 熱分析而得到。對於商業配方膠材的熱性質及熱反應性質均是透過多次
的試驗及客戶驗證，其參數之可信度及精確度較高，目前採用商業膠材為基底材料。 
(四)、 在膠膜設計方面：由計劃申請人所設計之配方模型，其特點是採用兩種以上封膠材料，
黏度大的封膠材其功能是牽制導電顆粒避免過度分散影響導電墊片下方之顆粒數量達
到較為經濟的特性；黏度較小的封膠材負責填充絕緣部分。雖然現今已有相關技術可
以改善短路橋接的現象，例如：可於導電粒子外覆被一層絕緣材料，所覆被的絕緣層
材料也必須在上下基板接合時被壓破形成上下基板導通的狀態，如此一來可完全改善
短路的問題，但是仍然有不被壓破或破裂不完全的受覆被顆粒形成導電墊片間斷路或
導通不完全的現象發生，而且導電顆粒一般為金屬包覆高分子顆粒球，其外再覆被絕
緣層材料，因製程及品質的要求價格一般都高於純金屬導電顆粒。因此，如要放棄使
用較昂貴的包覆絕緣之複合導電顆粒球，可於導電金屬顆粒中加入尺寸略小的絕緣顆
粒球，既不影響導通特性也可以降低短路發生的機率。但是，製造時均勻的複合材料
混拌技巧將是關鍵技術。 
(五)、 在界面接合方面：被設計之配方模型還要考慮不同材料的固化行為所形成交接面收縮
程度不同或不完全固化造成的翹曲，並形成內應力，因此材料間的接合性與反應固化
相容性是研究的重點。其中於界面對熱的不匹配特性(Thermal Mismatch)，也是研究的
重點。利用光彈性力學的理論透過應力偏光儀顯示出不同配方的導電膠層造成的封裝
體的內應力分布情形，藉以驗證本計畫所設計的配方的應力分散效應。 
(六)、 在製程參數方面：製程目前以等溫模式分析即在不同膠層中之溫度設定假設為一致，
所以各層間之材料黏度為定值，此時我們只解動量方程式；事實上熱壓合製程時間極
短，溫度變化差異不大，如暫以定黏度分析應尚可接受，再適當地加入非等溫效應或
膠體固化效應，來做進一步的複雜分析。

where fv  is the volume fraction of the conductive 
particles, d is the distance between the pads, h is the pad 
height, l is the side length of the square pad, and r is the 
radius of the conductive particles. Significantly, the 
model assumes that bridging failures only occur in the 
pitch direction of the IC, i.e. along the shortest path 
between neighboring pads. However, in practice, 
shorting may occur along any of the connective paths 
between adjacent pads, irrespective of their length and 
thus the actual bridging probability may well be higher 
than that estimated in Eq. (1). In other words, Eq. (1) 
essentially provides the lower bound of the bridging 
failure probability.  
 
Fig. 1. Illustration of flip chip joint, showing insulation and 
conductibility properties. 
Lin et al. [7-10] modeled the electrical yield of 
ACF packages using a Poisson function to estimate the 
opening failure probability and a modified box model to 
predict the bridging probability. Differing from the 
former publications, the new bridging model developed 
in this paper can be used to calculate the bridging 
probability with a more logical mathematical model. As 
shown in Fig. 2, the opening and bridging probabilities 
were plotted as a function of the volume fraction of the 
conductive particles within the ACF compound. The 
resulting V-shaped curve not only enables the failure 
probability to be rapidly determined for any given value 
of the volume fraction, but also indicates the optimal 
volume fraction, i.e. the volume fraction which 
minimizes the overall package failure probability. 
In the modified bridging model [7], the original 
model presented by Mannan et al. [6] was amended to 
reflect the possibility of shorting occurring along any of 
the linear paths through the ACF compound between 
adjacent substrates. In the proposed approach, the 
bridging probability was computed using a summation 
technique in which all of the possible intersections of 
events from nBBB ,,, 21 L  (shown in the Eq. 2) were 
obtained and their respective probabilities were 
computed, i.e.

Fig. 2. Illustrative V-shaped curve for ACF probability failure 
estimation. 
However, in developing this model, it is assumed 
that the bridging conditions over two or more conductive 
paths in the meanwhile are neglected. As a result, Eq. (2) 
tends to over-estimate the bridging failure probability. In 
other words, Eq. (2) essentially provides the upper 
bound of the bridging failure probability.

In constructing the current bridging model, each 
bridging path is indexed by its start point (i.e. its 
left-hand end) and its end point (i.e. its right-hand end), 
i.e. (i1 , j1) and (i2 , j2) , respectively.

between adjacent pads. 
 
 
Fig. 4. (a) Finite connective model considering bridging in all 
directions, and (b) calculation of bridging probability 
using product operation. 
Clearly, the shortest dimensionless distance 
between (i1 , j1) and (i2 , j2) is given by ( ) ( ) ( )2212212* jjiid −+−+ . 
As a result, the minimum number of particles (i.e. boxes) 
required to bridge the gap between neighboring pads is 
( ) ( ) ( )2212212* jjiid −+−+ . These boxes form a continuous strip 
with a bridging probability of  
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )2212212* jjiidboxstrip PP −+−+=  (10) 
where boxP  is the bridging probability of the box; 
stripP  is the bridging probability of the strip between  
(i1 , j1) and (i2 , j2). However, not all of the linear lines 
between the side walls of the two adjacent pads 
comprise a continuous chain of particles. In other words, 
some of these lines have an insulating property. The 
insulation probability of a bridging strip is given by 
( ) ( ) ( )2212212*)(1 jjiidboxCstrick PP −+−+−=  (11)

The probability of each box containing a particle is

failure probability can be analytically expressed by an 
easy formula (see Eq. 16). The enhanced bridging model 
can especially simply the multifarious considerations 
and enhance the computational performances under the 
overall failure analysis. Although the estimation method 
of the enhanced bridging model is better than the box 
and modified box models, but the present model isn’t 
still a faithful computational model.  An accuracy 
calculation must consider all possible bridging paths 
(including curviform, ambagious, and direct paths), and 
it will be a great deal work impossibly. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the bridging probability 
calculated using the current model is indeed greater than 
that predicted by the original box model, but smaller 
than that estimated by the modified box model. This 
finding suggests that in practical applications, when 
defining the V-shaped curve to identify the optimal 
volume fraction of the ACF compound, the enhanced 
bridging model presented in this study should be used to 
avoid over- or under-estimating the bridging failure 
probability.

original box model [6] and modified box model [7]. 
4.2. Application of V-shaped curve method 
In evaluating the overall failure probability of the 
ACF package, this study uses the Poisson function to 
estimate the opening failure probability and the 
enhanced bridging model to estimate the shorting failure 
probability. Previous studies have already confirmed the 
accuracy of the Poisson function in modeling the open 
circuit. Meanwhile, the enhanced bridging model 
proposed in this study calculates the bridging failure 
probability by considering all of the possible linear paths 
between adjacent pads. Consequently, the bridging 
estimates are more logical than those generated by the 
original box model [6] or the modified box model [7].  
As discussed in the Introduction section, the 
V-shaped curve plots the failure probability as a function 
of the volume fraction of the conductive particles. The 
tip of the V-shaped curve indicates the lowest failure 
probability and the optimal volume fraction. Fig. 2 
illustrate the effects of the IC / substrate geometry on the 
opening and bridging failure probabilities. As shown, for 
a constant volume fraction, the opening failure 
probability decreases with increasing l*. Meanwhile, the 
bridging failure probability reduces with decreasing h* or 
increasing d*. In other words, the major factors 
governing the yield of the flip chip package are the 
dimensionless geometry parameters of the IC / substrate 
assembly, i.e. l*, h* and d*, and the volume fraction, vf , 
of the ACF compound.  
4.3. Limitations of proposed bridging model 
Although the enhanced bridging model presented in 
this study yields more logical bridging failure estimates 
than either the original bridging model or the modified 
model, it is not without its limitations. For example, the 
model only considers bridging between two adjacent 
pads, whereas in practice bridging may occur between 
any two contiguous pads within the entire IC / substrate 
assembly. In other words, the current model takes a local 
rather than global view of the bridging phenomenon [10]. 
It is worth to be addressed the failure probability of ACF 
packages is sensitive to the pads array dimension (nxn) 
and the geometry parameters l, d, h, r, etc. The overall 
global failure probability can be computed by using the 
Inclusion–Exclusion Principal with the numerical 
computation. The pads array dimension effects 
considering the different geometry parameters will be 
another important issue in the future. Furthermore, in 
reality, the particles in the ACF compound are dispersed 
in accordance with a stochastic distribution and the final 
positions of the particles will change following the 
compression process. However, the effects of this 
physical change on the opening and bridging 
probabilities are not reflected within the current model.

that the more realistic treatment of bridging effects in the64
enhanced box model improved the yield of the minimum failure65
probability and optimal volume fraction estimates compared to66
those obtained using the original V-shaped curve method.67
Recently, Lin et al. [10] analyzed the effect of the upper-68
to-lower-pad-height ratio on the global failure probability of69
IC/substrate assemblies packaged using ACF, and they found70
that the package yield could be improved by reducing the total71
height of the two pad arrays or by utilizing pad arrays with72
an equal height. Furthermore, it was shown that the V-shaped73
curve method provides an effective means of predicting the74
influence of an asymmetrical pad-height distribution on the75
yield of the IC/substrate package. In addition to pad-height76
asymmetries, the failure probability of ACF packages is also77
increased by the presence of misalignments between the upper78
and lower pad arrays. However, to the best of the current79
authors’ knowledge, the literature lacks any formal investi-80
gation into the correlation between the degree of the pack-81
age misalignment and the corresponding failure probability.82
Accordingly, this paper modifies the original V-shaped curve83
method to take account of misalignment effects on the effective84
conductive area between opposing pads and the length of85
the bridging paths between neighboring upper/lower pad pairs86
when computing the opening and bridging failure probabilities,87
respectively. It is shown that the modified V-shaped curve88
method enables not only the failure probability of the ACF89
package to be reliably predicted for any given value of the90
pad-array misalignment but also an estimate to be made of the91
corresponding optimal ACF volume fraction.92
II. FAILURE PREDICTION THEORY93
A. Probability Analysis of Local IC/Substrate94
Assembly Failure95
As described earlier, ACF-packaged IC/substrate assemblies96
are liable to two different types of failure, namely, opening97
and bridging failures. An opening failure occurs when the 98
gap between the pads of the IC/substrate assembly contains 99
an insufficient number of particles to form a conductive path 100
between them (see Fig. 1). The probability of having n particles 101
between the pads can be described by the following Poisson 102
distribution: 103
PO (n = 0, µo(f)) =
µn0 e
−µ0
n!
∣∣∣∣
n=0

6l∗2f
π (1)
where µo is the average number of particles between the pads 104
in the vertical direction, f is the volume fraction of particles 105
within the ACF resin, l is the side length of the square pads, r is 106
the radius of the conductive particles, and l∗ is a dimensionless 107
integer defined as l∗ = [l/2r] (where [ ] is a Gaussian function). 108
In a previous study by the current group, it was shown that a 109
density of more than five particles per pad is required to ensure 110
a reliable electrical contact between the IC and the substrate [3], 111
[4]. Hence, for a given IC/substrate assembly, the probability of 112
maintaining an effective electrical contact between the upper 113
and lower pads can be ensured by specifying the volume 114
fraction of the ACF compound such that the following condition 115
is satisfied: 116

A bridging failure occurs when a continuous chain of conduc- 117
tive particles is formed between neighboring pads (see Fig. 1). 118

is the distance between pads, h is the pad height, l is the side 122
length of the square pad, and r is the radius of the conductive 123
particles. 124
Lin et al. [3] modified (3) to take account of the possibility 125
of bridging in multiple directions and showed that the bridging 126

From an inspection of (14), it can be seen that the global failure187
probability of the ACF package varies as a function of the local188
particle volume fraction following compression, the conductive189
particle size, the pad dimensions, the pad pitch, and the number190
of pads in each array.191
III. ANALYSIS OF MISALIGNMENT EFFECTS ON192
FAILURE PROBABILITY OF ACF PACKAGE193
A. Opening Analysis194
In evaluating the opening failure probability for the case195
where misalignments exist in the X- and Y -directions between196
the upper and lower pad arrays in the IC/substrate assembly, it197
is necessary to determine the effective conductive area between198
the pads in the two arrays (see Fig. 3). Having determined the199
effective conductive area, the local and global probabilities of200
an opening failure can then be computed using a modified form201
of (2) and (10), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, misalignments202
in the IC/substrate assembly reduce the effective conductive203
area between opposing pads from l2 to (l −∆x)(l −∆y). The204
dimensionless effective conductive area can be expressed as205

where ∆x and ∆y are the misalignment offsets in the X- and 206
Y -directions, respectively; ∆x∗ and ∆y∗ are the dimension- 207
less offsets in the X- and Y -directions, respectively; Aeﬀ is 208
the effective conductive area; A∗eﬀ is the dimensionless effec- 209
tive conductive area; and Ex(= (∆x/l) · 100% = (∆x∗/l∗) · 210
100%) and Ey(= (∆y/l) · 100% = (∆y∗/l∗) · 100%) are the 211
offset percentages in the X- and Y -directions, respectively. 212
To analyze the effects of misalignments in the X- and 213
Y -directions on the local opening failure probability, (2) is 214
reformulated as follows: 215

Having computed the local opening probability using (16), 216
the global opening probability can then be calculated us- 217
ing (10). 218
B. Bridging Analysis 219
Fig. 5 shows the effects of misalignments in the X- and Y - 220
directions on the four possible bridging paths between neigh- 221
boring pairs of opposing pads. Clearly, path 1 (UA ↔ UB) and 222
path 4 (LA ↔ LB) are unaffected by the misalignment between 223
the upper and lower pads, and thus, the probability of a local 224
bridging failure along these two paths can be computed using 225
(5). However, path 2 (UA ↔ LB) is shortened while path 3 226
(LA ↔ UB) is lengthened as a result of the misalignment, and 227
thus, (5) no longer applies. The probability of a local bridging 228
failure in any direction, given a misalignment of the upper and 229
lower pads in the X-direction, is given by 230

right of the turning point represents the bridging probability. It299
is observed that the optimal volume fraction (i.e., the volume300
fraction that yields the minimum failure probability) increases301
with an increasing misalignment in the Y -direction. Thus, it302
can be inferred that, for a unidirectional misalignment of the303
ACF package, misalignments between the upper and lower pad304
arrays have a greater effect on the opening failure probability305
than on the bridging failure probability. It is observed that, for306
values of the misalignment offset Ey that are less than 10%,307
the minimum failure probability of the ACF package remains308
constant at approximately 10−9. However, as the value of Ey is309
increased incrementally from 20% to 30%, 40%, and 50%, re-310
spectively, the minimum failure probability increases by around311
one order (ten times) each time. In other words, the V-shaped312
curves move toward the right and in the upward direction as the313
degree of unidirectional misalignment is increased.314
Fig. 8 shows the V-shaped curves for the ACF package315
shown in Fig. 7 for various degrees of misalignment in both316
the X- and Y -directions. Comparing the results shown in317
Fig. 8 with those in Fig. 6, it is evident that the opening318
failure probability increases significantly with an increasing319
misalignment, whereas the bridging failure probability remains320
relatively unchanged for a given misalignment condition. This321

and Y -direction misalignment offsets.
result is to be expected since the offsets of the upper/lower 322
pads in the bidirectional misalignment are included in the X- 323
and Y -direction offsets (see Fig. 5). The misalignment in the 324
bridging circuit causes the upper/lower pads to close (path 2: 325
R = d−∆x or d−∆y) and separate (path 3: R = d+∆x 326
or d+∆y) simultaneously. Hence, the effects of bidirectional 327
misalignments on the bridging probability are qualitatively 328
similar to those of unidirectional misalignments and should 329
be considered as synergistic and complementary results in the 330
failure probabilities of paths 2 and 3. 331
Fig. 9 shows the turning-point values of the V-shaped curves 332
shown in Figs. 6 and 8 for uni- and bidirectional misalign- 333
ments, respectively. Note that the turning points associated with 334
misalignment conditions other than those shown in the figure 335
can be determined via a process of linear interpolation. As 336
discussed previously, the turning point of the V-shaped curve 337
associated with a specified misalignment condition (Ex, Ey) 338
represents the optimal design point for the ACF package, 339
i.e., the minimum failure probability and the corresponding 340
ACF volume fraction. It is observed in Fig. 9 that both the 341
failure probability and the optimal volume fraction increase 342
more significantly with an increasing bidirectional misalign- 343
ment than with a unidirectional misalignment. For example, 344
for unidirectional misalignments in the 0%–10% range, the 345
minimum failure probability varies only in the 4× 10−10−4× 346
10−9 range, while the optimal volume fraction remains constant 347
at approximately 0.1. However, for bidirectional misalignments 348
of less than (10%, 10%), the minimum failure probability is 349
distributed in the 4× 10−10−10−8 range, while the optimal 350
volume fraction varies from 0.1 to 0.12. Generally speaking, 351
it can be seen that the semilogarithmic failure probability 352
increases approximately linearly with the volume fraction for 353
both uni- and bidirectional misalignments of the ACF package. 354
For the case of a unidirectional misalignment of the ACF 355
package, the failure probability increment associated with the 356

omitted here since their turning points correspond to a failure407
probability that is higher than 10−5. In other words, irrespective408
of the value assigned to the volume fraction, misalignments of409

exceed the target failure probability value of 10−5 and are 411
therefore excluded from the figure.) Similarly, dashed line B 412
corresponds to a failure probability of 10−8. The volume frac- 413
tion ranges that limit the failure probability to a value that is less 414
than this target value are indicated in labels b1−b5 for various 415
values of (Ex, Ey). (Note that offset values of (Ex, Ey) = 416
(10%, 10%), and (20%, 20%) result in a failure probability that 417
is greater than 10−8 and are therefore omitted in labels b1−b5.) 418
As expected, a comparison of the ranges given in a1−a7 with 419
those given in b1−b5 shows that the degree of latitude in 420
assigning the volume fraction reduces as the failure probability 421
requirement becomes more stringent. In practice, the V-shaped 422
curves have a near-symmetrical form, and thus, in specifying 423
the ACF volume fraction required to satisfy the specified failure 424
probability for a given misalignment offset, the midrange value 425
represents a suitable value since it most closely approximates 426
the turning point in the curve. In general, misalignments of the 427
ACF package may arise as a result of machine vibration, an 428
incorrect positioning of the IC chip relative to the substrate, 429
scale error, and so forth. However, empirical evidence suggests 430
that modern packaging techniques are capable of limiting the 431
misalignments to very small. Nonetheless, such misalignments 432
are deliberately included within the analyses presented in this 433
paper in order to demonstrate the robustness of the V-shaped 434
curve method. 435
