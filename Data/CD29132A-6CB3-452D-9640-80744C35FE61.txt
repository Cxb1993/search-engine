Abstract in English 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of mRNA expression or/and translation. 
A large proportion of human protein-coding genes have been found that are regulated by miRNAs, suggesting 
that miRNAs have a critical role in a wide variety of biological functions. As they play important roles in 
biological processes including development and differentiation of tissues, miRNAs have been validated to be 
important for cardiac diseases. However, how many miRNAs and target genes involve in the cardiovascular 
system and how their regulations cause cardiac diseases are mostly unknown. In this project, we used 
microarray and deep sequencing analyses to estimate the expression changes of mRNAs and microRNAs 
isolated from hypertrophic murine hearts subjected to pressure overload for 2 weeks, respectively. In the result, 
we found that only a few of known hypertrophy mark genes had been detected as significantly over- or 
under-expression. Moreover, we also observed that the read counts of miR-1 were extremely high in cardiac 
tissues. To explore whether the impact of miR-1 on target genes was much more important than others and 
whether genes targeted by miR-1 only and if only regulated by miR-1, we developed an alternative approach 
to analyze miRNA expressions in cardiac hypertrophy by deep sequencing data and found that in cardiac 
tissues the impact of miR-1 could be diluted by abundant target genes.

role in biology. The commercial products, such as the Roche/454 FLX Pyrosequencer (26) and the 
Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer (27), provide the platforms for massively parallel DNA/RNA sequencing 
read production on genetics and genomics (28-29). These platforms can read DNA or RNA short sequences 
out base by base directly and generate several hundred thousand reads (using Roche/454) to tens of millions 
of reads (using Illumina/Solexa) per sample in few working days. To date, the NGS instruments have became 
the powerfully experimental tools to discover new miRNAs as well as to identify miRNA expression changes 
in in vivo and in vitro (30-34). By deep sequencing, RNA expression can be estimated by sequenced read 
count which is more accurate and sensitive than those by microarray. 
 
Literature studies 
 
Several cardiac diseases have been studied that associated with miRNAs. In cardiac hypertrophy and heart 
failure, von Rooij et al (2006) analyzed 186 miRNAs and described a typical signature pattern of miRNAs in 
hypertrophic or failing hearts from mice and humans (35). They also found that in vivo cardiac-specific 
over-expression of miR-195 resulted in pathological cardiac remodeling and heart failure in mice. Ikeda et al. 
(2007) found that expression of many miRNAs was altered in human heart disease in a distinct manner to 
predict clinical diagnosis for different types of heart disease (36). In the same year, von Rooij et al showed 
that the cardiac-specific miR-208 indirectly regulates the expression of the -myosin heavy chain (MHC) 
gene, a regulator of cardiac contractility (23). In addition, miR-133 was also found that its expression was 
decreased in mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy and in the myocardium of patients with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (37). Interestingly, Thum et al (2007) found that cardiac transcriptome analysis revealed 
striking similarities between fetal and failing human heart tissue (38). Reactivation of a fetal miRNA program 
seems to substantially contribute to alterations of gene expression triggering pathological changes in the 
myocardium associated with progressive dysfunction (16). 
 
Several target genes of cardiac related miRNAs have also been identified and validated in recent literature 
and all of them were chosen from TargetScan (2, 39), miRanda (40-41), or PicTar (42-43). Hand2 has been 
validated as the target gene of miR-1 (23). Hand2 is a critical cardiac transcription factor and essential for 
normal cardiomyocyte development and morphogenesis. Moreover, miR-1 overexpression slowed conduction 
and depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane by post transcriptionally repressing KCNF2 and GFA1 (44), 
leading to severe cardiac arrhythmias. miR-133 target genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy were recently 
identified as Rhoa, Cdc42, and Whsc2 (37). Predicted by PicTar and later experimental validation, thyroid 
hormone receptor associated protein 1 (THRAP1) is a target of miR-208 (23). 
 
 
Research Design and Methods 
Working flow of our study 
In the proposed study, we first sacrificed six mice that three by Sham operation and the other three by 
TAB operation (described below). Then, the isolated RNAs divided into two sets: one for microarray analysis 
of gene expression and the other for small RNA deep sequencing. After raw data processing and analysis, we 
identified differentially expressed genes and miRNAs between two samples. Moreover, we used TargetScan to 
 7 
KEGG PATHWAY Database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). We also refer to Mouse Genome 
Informatics (http://www.informatics.jax.org/) for further functional descriptions of up- and down-regulated 
genes. 
 
miRNA target prediction 
We used TargetScan 5.2 (2, 39) to predict the target genes of up- and down-regulated miRNAs. We only 
used conserved target genes for our analysis. The total predicted target gene number of all miRNA families is 
49,562. In this database, the total mouse genes are 17,315 while only 8,873 have been predicted as miRNA 
target genes. 
 
Small RNA Deep Sequencing 
The total RNAs of mouse sham and TAB samples were isolated by Dr. Chen's laboratory. The 
construction of short-read library, quality check, and sequencing were all done by the Biofuel High 
Throughput Sequencing Core Facility at Academia Sinica. We sequenced one sample by one lane. The output 
raw reads are 40-nt in lengths. The expenditures of sequencing were supported by Academia Sinica. 
 
 
Data Processing of Small RNA Raw Reads 
Each read first aligned with the adapter sequence by our home-made program. When the aligned length 
 8, only one mismatch was allowed; otherwise, two mismatches were allowed. The region aligned with the 
adapter sequence was trimmed for each read. If the reminded length >32 or < 16, the read was abandoned. 
Moreover, we also generated a lookup table to save the unique reads and their frequencies. 
 
Genome Remapping 
We used Bowtie (48) to map the trimmed reads to the mouse genome (UCSC mm9) with default 
parameters. The mapping result were also compared with the known miRNA loci downloaded from miRBase 
(http://www.mirbase.org/). 
 
RESULTS 
Up- and Down-regulated Genes in the mouse heart after subjected to TAB 
In microarray data, there are 18,278 genes passed the signal and flag criterions. The correlations of total 
gene expressions in the sham and TAB tissues are high corrected and almost without bias (R
2
 > 0.90, Figure 
2a). The distribution of gene expression differences between two samples is close to normal (mean=0.00 with 
standard deviation(std)=0.8895). Thus, the threshold of a two-fold change was set to 1.779 (2std). 
In the total 1,079 genes passed the threshold, 542 genes were up-regulated and 537 genes were 
down-regulated in the mouse cardiac tissues under overloaded pressure. However, if neglected those genes 
without annotated name, only 393 and 343 were up- and down-regulated, respectively.

out ~10% impossible cases of each sample (Table 1). Then, we calculated the total length distributions for 
each samples and found that almost the reads their read lengths are between 20 to 23 bp. Since their total read 
counts were very close that indicates no sequencing bias in this experiment, we therefore did not need to 
normalize the read counts of these two samples.

In general, there are two approaches for remapping of small RNA reads: genome-based and 
miRNA-mature-sequence-based. In the study, we used both approaches. 
First, we used Bowtie (48) to align the processed reads to the mouse reference genome (UCSC mm9) 
separately, and set the criteria to "best hit", which could allow some variances from polymorphism, RNA 
editing, or sequencing error. We also dealt with the reads of single hit and multiple hit separately. A single hit 
indicates that a unique read only maps to one region in the whole mouse genome and a multiple hit indicates 
that a unique read maps to more than one region in the genome. In our analysis process, we focused on the 
miRNAs with expression mainly contributed by single hit, because most of their reads were derived from a 
unique region in the mouse genome. We considered those by multiple hit as a reference. 
With a bit surprising, the mapping ratios of both samples are  98.9% (Table 1). It indicates that the 
sequencing quality for that run was good. Among these aligned reads, > 75% of the reads for both samples are 
all multiple hits. These reads can derive from different locations in the genome.  
We also directly mapped trimmed reads with known mouse mature miRNA sequences in miRBase 
(version 17). In the 1102 mouse mature sequences, 635 have at least one read hit in which 175 have hit with at 
least  100 reads in either or both samples. The expression correlation for the 175 miRNAs in both samples is 
very high (R>0.99, Figure 4). It indicates that the miRNA levels have much slightly different than mRNA 
levels between these two samples.

Figure 7. Arevy et al (2010) proposed that target mRNA abundnat usually dilutes miRNA and 
siRNA acitvity. The figure was motified from their original paper (50). 
However, in the current transfection technology the quantities of transfected miRNAs cannot be accurately 
controlled and are always much higher than endogenous ones. Thus, in Arevy et al's analysis the quantities of 
endogenous miRNAs could be neglected because abundantly transfected miR-As and miR-Bs can make the 
input quantities being close equal in vitro. (Figure 8a).

Figure 8. (a) A diagram to explain why the endogenously expressed miRNAs can be 
neglected in Arevy et al's study (2010). (b) If only conisdering endogenously expressed levels, 
how the miRNAs affect thier target miRNAs? 
However, if the qualities of miR-A and miR-B in vivo are different, does target mRNA abundance dilute 
miRNA activity without transfected mimic miRNAs (Figure 8b)? 
In this study, we propose an alternative approach to analyze miRNA expressions in cardiac hypertrophy by 
deep sequencing data. The original idea was based on Arevy et al's study that miRNA activity is dependent on 
its target number. We first downloaded the miRNA families from TargetScan (Release 5.2) and calculated the 
total read counts for each miRNA family. According to the target number, we calculated the average read 
count per target for each miRNA (read/target) and calculated the read count difference between sham and 
TAB samples for each miRNA (read/target). Then, we accumulated the total average miRNA read counts for 
each target gene, called total suppressed miRNA read counts (TSMRCs) and calculated the difference 
between sham and TAB samples. 
As the result shown in Figure 9, miR-1/206, miR-378/422a, and miR-126/126-3p were the top three 
abundant miRNAs by the original read counts where miR-1/206 has much more read counts than the others. 
However, after normalization by target gene number, the normalized read counts for miR-1/206 was less than 
the others because its target genes are much more than the others (Figure 9). It indicates that the repression 
ability of miR-1 for its taregt genes on average were not as good as those of miR-126/126-3p in mouse cardiac

The evolution from C3 to C4 photosynthesis has been concluded that is largely a story of gene duplication. However, the 
conclusion was too broad to explain the C4 evolution because gene duplication is a general evolutionary mechanism to 
generate new functions, not just only for C4 photosynthesis. In this study, we used the maize paralog information and 
defined a duplication profile to represent the paralog numbers in the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs). Then, we 
used a hierarchical approach to cluster the maize genes with paralogs into 20 clusters. Interestingly, we found that ~75% of 
the genes have only single MRCAs and over 50% of them have their paralogs found only in the maize genome. These 
genes and their paralogs may be more related to maize-specific phenotypes but less related to C4 development. Moreover, 
most C4 genes had been duplicated several times before Poaceae plants emerged and the duplication events of some C4 
genes occurred at similar times.
