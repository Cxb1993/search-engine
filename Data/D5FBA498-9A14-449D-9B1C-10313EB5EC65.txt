Therefore, additional to rapid and accurate 
detection, a sensitive and real-time 
measurement is important in preventive and 
clinical diagnosis [6-8].  In this study, two 
microbial detection systems based on 
conductance method had been developed. The 
microorganisms could be quantified using this 
method. Microorganisms were detected 
through the blocking of electric pathways with 
carbon dioxide (CO2) bubbles produced [9-10] 
during the metabolisms of the microorganisms. 
The detection of facultative anaerobic bacteria 
was through a capillary system. Bacteria were 
cultured in a sealed capillary tube filled with 
culture medium. Carbon dioxide bubbles 
formed would reduce the pH value in the 
medium and also generate a blockage in the 
capillary [11]. This system was applied for the 
susceptibility testing of bacteria. A total of 
four samples including two strains of 
Escherichia coli, one strain of Klebsiella 
pneumonia and one strain of Entrobacter 
cloacae were tested. Each of them was tested 
three times against five antibiotics (Ampicillin, 
Cephalothin, Cefotaxime, Amikacin and 
Gentamicin). The reproducibility for all agents 
was 100% in the 1 log2-dilution range. And 
the concentration highly corresponded to the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (in 
the range of ±1 log2) obtained from the 
conventional micro-dilution method.  The 
microbial detection systems based on 
conductivity are new methods to quantify and 
to test the susceptibility of microorganisms. In 
this project, we provide a rapid and reliable 
detection tool for microorganism rapid 
monitoring. By the developing of 
multi-channel, we have successfully improved 
the sensing effectiveness for bacterial 
detection. 
2. Material and methods 
2.1 Reaction cell and multi-channel system 
The prerequisite of the application of 
capillary conductance method is that the 
reaction cell must be a sealed system. In this 
study, we used the glass capillary tubes (0.75 
mm in inner diameter and 10 cm in length) as 
the reaction cells, through the combination of 
silicon tubes and Teflon tubes, we fixed the 
electrodes (Pt wire was 0.5 mm in diameter 
and 1 cm in length) on the capillary tube and 
formed a sealed reaction system shown as Fig 
1. In order to reduce the consumption of 
manpower, via the connecting of a 
programmable logic control (programmable 
logic control; PLC, FX2-16MR, Mitsubishi, 
Japan) device with the capillary conductance 
system connected with a conductimeter 
(Consort C833E Analyzer; Belgium) we have 
built a 7-channel system. And through the 
design of computer controlling programs 
(LabVIEW software; National Instrument, 
USA), we could get and chart the signals 
automatically and immediately.  
2.2 Bacterial strains and reagents  
To verify of capillary conductance method 
for susceptibility testing, four strains of 
bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae were being 
tested against seven antimicrobial agents. The 
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was obtained 
from the American Type Culture Collection, 
Rockville, Md., and the other strains were 
isolated at the National Cheng Kung 
University Hospital from various clinical 
specimens (Escherichia coli 03190, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae 03583, and Entrobacter cloacae 
00109). The seven antibiotics (ampicillin, 
cephalothin, cefotaxime, amikacin, and LL-37) 
were obtained from sigma (Sigma Chemical 
CO., St. Louis, MO.). The cation-adjusted 
Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) was 
compound by the MHB obtained from BBL 
(Becton Dickinson and Company, USA). The 
tryptic soy agar (TSA) was obtained from 
HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Limited, Mumbai, 
India.  
2.3 Susceptibility test 
Two colonies of bacteria on an 18 to 24 
hour pure culture agar plate were transferred 
to a tube containing 3 ml of pure water and 
adjusted to match the 0.5 McFarland turbidity 
standard (1~2 x 108 CFU/ml). The 0.5 
McFarland suspension was diluted 1:10 in 
sterile CAMHB to obtain the desired 
inoculum concentration (5 x 105 CFU/ml)[]. 
Five concentrations of each antibiotic were 
prepared at two-fold serial dilutions according 
to the MICs obtained from broth dilution 
method, and 0.5 ml of antibiotics were mixed 
with 50 μl of the inoculums as the testing 
samples. Within 15 minutes of preparation, the 
samples were inoculated into the capillary 
tubes and electrode-casing pipes by syringe. 
After combination of the capillary tubes and 
electrodes, seven reaction cells (contained 
negative control and positive control) were
