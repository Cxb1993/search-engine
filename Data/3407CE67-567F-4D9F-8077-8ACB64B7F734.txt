                        Abstract 
 
A novel magnetic material for hyperthermia is developed by adding iron 
and neodymium ions into DP-Bioglass (Na2O-CaO-P2O5-SiO2) as heat 
source when an alternative magnetic field is applied. A various value of 
Nd-Fe ratio and the amount of Nd-Fe determine different area of 
hysteresis loop which means more or less hysteresis loss generated. The 
results of biodegradable and cytotoxicity tests show that the magnetic 
bioglass is potential for hyperthermia owing to its unique and excellent 
properties. The magnetic bioglass will be one of the best candidates for 
hyperthermia to destroy cancer cells in the future, if surface modification 
for targeting can be accomplished.

Chapter 1 Introduction 
 
1.1 Prologue 
 
In modern society, human have more and more opportunities to fall 
illness caused by contacting toxic, irregular eating and life habits. 
Malignant tumor, so called cancer, is one of the troublesome diseases up 
to now. In table 1-1 [1], it can be seen that cancer has been serious threats 
for our life. Compared with the change in US death rates in Fig. 1-1, 
many diseases, such as heart diseases, cerebrovascular disease and so on, 
have a huge decline from 1950 to 2003 [2]. However, cancer is the one 
that has no change of death rate in the fifties years.

1.2 Cancer 
 
Definition of cancer 
 
What is cancer? There was no suitable and exact answer for the 
question until 1930. Pathologist, Jamie Ewing [4], gave a definition of 
neoplasm: a neoplasm is relatively autonomous growth of tissue. This 
definition supplies a common rule for various cancers. So called 
“autonomy” means interactions rules and growth rate of cancer cells are 
out of control from whole body cells. However, relatively autonomous 
means cancer is not totally autonomous. So the autonomy of cancer is 
relative, not absolute [5]. Actually, the growth rate of cancer can be as 
slow as normal cells in an extreme situation, or as fast as embryo tissues 
in another extreme situation. 
 
Today, what we called cancer and tumor are the same diseases. In 
scientific or medical field, cancer can be named as malignant neoplasm. 
And all abnormal mass or abnormal growth of tissue are called tumor. So 
neoplasm is tumor. Besides any swellings, bruises, scars, lumps and so on 
also are called neoplasm. Broadly speaking, cancer is an abnormal cell, a 
cell transformed by virus, chemical matters or other things, a kind of 
tumor, and a kind of malignant neoplasm [6]. 
 
Cancer cells are different from normal cells for their special growth 
behavior. That includes five parts: proliferation, metaplasia, dysplasia, 
anaplasia, and metastasis [6]. The detail statement can be seen as 
following.  
 
1. Proliferation: the cancer cell number increases and the cell division 
can’t help stopping. But some normal cells in human body also are 
with proliferation. Therefore, it is not necessary condition for cancer 
cells [7]. 
 
2. Metaplasia: In a specific organ or structure of organ, a reversible 
situation that adult cells can be substituted by another type of adult 
cells.

1.3 Cancer therapy 
 
Surgery [9-10] 
 
Surgical excision is the earliest and most tried therapeutic method 
for cancer treatment. And it is often the first step in cancer treatment. 
Therefore, the importance of surgical excision is more than radiation and 
chemotherapy because it has more opportunity than above radiation and 
chemotherapy treatments for people to cure. However, early cancer 
surgery often resulted in the recurrence of the malignant tumor, even if 
the death of patients. Fortunately, due to the development of blood 
transfusions, the use of antibiotics, tracheostomy to prevent patients from 
the obstruction of airway and nasogastic decompression of stomach and 
so on, the cancer surgery is anything but the dangerous modality. 
Generally speaking, cancer surgery is operated in period of cancer 
without metastasis [11] to other organs or tissues. In this way, there is a 
better and effective chance to get over. Sometimes, doctors would excise 
the normal tissues or lymph node next to the tumor tissues to decrease the 
possibility of metastasis and recurrence.  
 
There is another crucial feature about cancer surgery is to diagnose, 
which is called biopsy. It is a procedure in diagnose of malignant disease 
in that biopsy provides doctors and pathologists with adequate samples of 
tumor. Several biopsy techniques are available, including exfoliative 
cytology, punch biopsy, incisional biopsy, excisional biopsy, shave biopsy, 
and needle aspiration biopsy etc [12]. By these, the outcome of metastasis 
and stage of cancer would be known, in this way, to choose what kinds of 
treatments should be applied. 
 
Although cancer surgery is the most direct way to treat, there are 
still many shortcomings that need to solve and notice. As the cancer cells 
metastasize, they would spread out the whole body and grow rapidly. So 
how to eradicate local and regional tumor without metastasis or other 
residual tumor cells is extremely a difficult issue. And the surgical site 
should be out of infection. Moreover, patients with pains after surgery 
may take some analgesic to alleviate. However, in general radiation 
therapy and chemotherapy need to be combined with cancer surgery as 
adjunct therapies [13-14]. Summary, cancer surgery is one of the most

metastasize to other parts of body, radiation can only do limited 
contribution to patients. So radiation such as surgery needs to combine 
other therapy like chemotherapy as an auxiliary treatment. 
 
Table 1-2 Radiation complications [18] 
 
 
Chemotherapy 
 
Surgery and radiation therapy only are effective in early stage of 
cancer occurrence. Once metastatic (systematic) cancer starts, nowadays, 
one of the most popular feasible therapies is chemotherapy. First, this 
kind of therapy was proposed by Lissauer in 1865 [19] and potassium 
arsenic, called Fowler’s solution, became the first anticancer. Up to 1946, 
Gilman and Philips [20] showed a paper that patients with caner could be 
better by means of nitrogen mustard, and the research of chemotherapy 
began a hot issue. Anticancer for clinical applications developed rapidly 
and most in 1955-1970 [21]. Although there still are new drugs for 
chemotherapy, most of them are all derivatives from drugs that produced 
in thirty or forty years ago. The detailed statement can be shown in Table 
1-3 [22] 
 
Drugs for chemotherapy can be classified for several types such as 
alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antibiotics, plant alkaloids, hormones, 
miscellaneous agent and others. Each one has different strategy to kill or 
restrain cancer cells. First, alkylating agents [23] such as nitrogen 
mustards can act on DNA directly and combine DNA by covalent

Immunotherapy 
 
Immunotherapy is one of biologic therapies that alter host and 
cancer cells relationship and improve the ability to resist cancer cells, 
instead of direct killing of cancer cells. In the last nineteenth century, 
Busch and Coley [35] were the first ones to announce that the infection of

Potential strategies in cancer gene therapy include three major 
aspects [40]. First, replace a missing or defective gene, such as a mutated 
tumor suppressor gene, for a correct or normal gene. Second, inhibit over 
expressed or amplified genes such as activated genes. Third, introduce a 
fragment of functional gene into a cell to express or not to express for 
desired treatment. For example, scientists are trying to get a normal 
fragment of the p53 gene [41] and using gene delivery techniques to 
insert the gene into cancer cells by a virus. It is because that more than 
half of all human cancers are with p53 mutations.  
 
However, there are some factors that keep cancer gene therapy from 
an effective treatment [42]. The gene introduced into targeting cells has to 
be stable and live long, instead of the disturbance of the rapid diving cells. 
So patients should be under several rounds of gene therapy. Immune 
response is also a risk when a foreign gene is introduced into human cells. 
Moreover, the vectors of gene delivery usually utilize virus that exists a 
variety of potential problems to patients. Although scientists have 
recently found non-virus vector for gene delivery, the effect of delivery is 
still out of desire. Besides, gene therapy for the condition or single 
mutations is the most appropriate treatment. But disorders caused by the 
combined effects of variations occur in some cancers. It is especially 
difficult to treat effectively by using gene therapy. Therefore, cancer gene 
therapy is not as good as a popular treatment.  
 
Hyperthermia 
 
Hyperthermia has been applied to various diseases, including cancer, 
science ancient time. It is combined by two words -- hyper, from the 
Greek, and therme. Hyper is with meaning is beyond, above, or over and 
therme means heat. So hyperthermia can be described as kinds of heat 
treatment, thermal therapy, or thermotherapy. Hippocrates (400 B.C.) has 
said that fire will succeed when all other methods fail [43]. Besides, he 
and Galen also used red-hot irons and chemical caustic to treat small and 
unknown cancers. Till last nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many 
more powerful and distinct evidences have been reported that elevated 
temperatures might be with a selective effect on cancer cells. For example, 
Selawry in 1957 [44] discovered that there are one third of 450 cancer 
patients with spontaneous remission owing to high fever caused by

1.4 Comparisons of cancer therapies 
 
As we see table 1-4 about the comparison of various cancer 
treatments. It can be known that hyperthermia possesses a lot of 
advantages and this kind of physical therapy can diminish many side 
effects and avoid serious risks. Although hyperthermia is with some risks 
and drawbacks so far, these problems, fortunately, has the possibility to 
solve. Moreover, compare with other treatment, they have more 
ineluctable limitations that can’t solve for a long time. Therefore, 
hyperthermia is one of the most potential therapies, and needs more 
researches and investigation [9-10, 15, 34, 37, 42, 46, 48-50].

1.5 Mechanism of hyperthermia 
 
Many experiments about relation of temperature and cell survival in 
hyperthermia have been done [51-54], and there is certainly a temperature 
range to heat cancer cells without destroying normal cells [55-56]. 
However, the temperature range depends on different parts of tissues and 
different animals, even each individual in the same kind. Generally 
speaking, the temperature for hyperthermia treatment is about 42-47℃  
[47]. Chinese hamster ovary line (CHO) in the temperature range of 
41.5-46.5℃ [57] can be seen in Fig. 1-2. The change of cell-surviving 
fraction is sharply declined when temperature is above 42.5℃. Moreover, 
the relative change in blood flow, strongly related the death of tissues, of 
normal tissues and tumors can be shown as in Fig. 1-3 [55]. When 
applied temperature rises to 44 or 46℃ approximately, the blood flow of 
normal tissues, like skin and muscle, also increase. But the blood flow of 
tumors seems not to increase as the temperature rises. It means that tumor 
with poor blood flow regulation is possible to be killed by raising 
temperature. Of course, once temperature still rises to higher temperature, 
all the blood flow of normal tissues and tumors don’t increase or even 
decrease severely. In this way, no matter what kinds of tissues would 
destroy or die due to insufficient blood flow. Hence in order to kill cancer 
cells and not to destroy normal tissue, the most moderate temperature for 
the treatment hyperthermia is about 42-47℃.

The micromilieu of cells has high relativity to thermosensitivity 
[59-61] and it is mainly dominated by two factors that are physiological 
factor--blood flow and metabolic factor—energy metabolism. Due to a 
lower density of blood vessels in tumors than in normal tissues, the 
oxygen pressure and nutrition is often lower in tumors than in normal 
tissues shown in Fig. 1-4 [62]. Therefore tumors would tend to be killed 
by heat owing to inferior heat elimination, and the conformational 
changes of proteins (denaturation) [63] in the cells such as structure of the 
cytoskeleton and enzymes complexes for DNA synthesis (Path A in Fig. 
1-5 [64]). It is known that high temperature affects the function of the 
membrane-based receptors. The change of sodium and potassium ion 
concentration alters membrane permeability that affects the conformation 
of intracellular ion channels [65-69].  
 
When cells are in the situation of high temperature, there would be a 
protect mechanism: heat shock proteins (HSPs) [70-72] are produced for 
stabilizing cytoskeleton structure [73]. Although heat shock proteins are 
able to protect cells from destroy of high temperature, there are also side 
factors that could make situation worse (Path B in Fig.1-5). Once a lot of 
heat shock proteins are generated-- it means that there are more and more 
energy needed to be used and much carbon dioxide produced, the 
increasing supply of ATP turns into depletion [74-77] and excessive 
carbon dioxide dissolved in water makes pH values of cells lower, so 
called acidosis [78].  
 
Moreover, it is possible for hyperthermia to induce the breakdown of 
blood flow, shown by Path C in Fig. 1-5, and complete mechanism can be 
seen in Fig. 1-6 [79]. For the reason, hypoxia and nutrient deficiency 
caused by decreasing blood flow make cell death [80-86] (Path F, H and I 
in Fig. 1-5). Besides, when a lot of head shock proteins are produced, 
sufficient oxygen is required for metabolizing glucose to water, carbon 
dioxide and energy (ATP) [78]. However, under hypoxic conditions, the 
stimulation of glycolysis increases the amounts of lactoses [81, 83, 87-91], 
especially in tumors. The acidosis not only results from excess of carbon 
dioxide but lactoses (Path G and D in Fig. 1-5). Furthermore, protein 
denaturation may occur owing to low pH value. The above statement 
gives brief and succinct conception about hyperthermia mechanism.

1.6 Classification of hyperthermia by heating method 
 
From the view points of heating methods, hyperthermia can be typed 
into local hyperthermia and systematic hyperthermia [92-93]. Local 
hyperthermia means that heat treatment only is carried on targeting site, 
instead of the temperature raise of whole body. There are two ways for 
local hyperthermia: (1) External heating source is out of skin and heat has 
to penetrate through skin to curial site. (2) Heating source is set in 
intracavitary or interstitial for internal heat treatment. However, 
systematic hyperthermia treatment makes the temperature of whole body 
increase. Owing to non-equal temperature increment, mild temperature is 
adequate for systematic hyperthermia. The comparisons of different 
heating methods of hyperthermia can be seen in Table 1-5.

Direct injection hyperthermia (DIH) 
 
The basic concept of DIH is similar to AEH, but DIH utilizes 
magnetic fluid to inject into tumor sites directly. The subsequent 
application of applying an alternative magnetic field causes the heating of 
deposited particles. Therefore, the magnetic particles of DIH are 
deposited extracellularly, instead of AEH, where magnetic particles 
embolize within blood vessels. Shinkai et al. [96-97] have conducted a 
successful serious of experiments about using magnetite cationic 
liposomes (MCLs), can be seen in Fig. 1-8 [96], as the thermoseed for 
DIH. Fig. 1-9 [97] shows the comparison of experimental and control 
groups of hamsters for DIH treatment.

1.8 Bioglass for intracellular hyperthermia  
 
In the last decade, intracellular hyperthermia with iron oxide has 
been an increased investigation. For this utilized nanosized iron oxide 
particles, magnetite Fe3O4 and maghemite γ-Fe2O3 are extensively the 
frequent and long [100] choices for their magnetic properties. Among 
them, magnetite is a promising candidate for its good biocompatibility 
[101]. However, these oxides in human bodies are of chemical stability. 
In other words, they are hard to biodegradable in human bodies and have 
the possibility of deposition in liver or somewhere else. Therefore, many 
groups developed different magnetic materials recently for improving the 
bioactive and biodegradable properties. One of these novel biomaterials is 
bioglass which is obtained by melting and then quenching (rapid cooling). 
The following introduction would give a brief concept and classification 
of bioglass. 
 
Brief history and composition of bioceramics / bioglass 
 
Bioeramic materials, including bioglass, have been revolutionizing 
and utilizing in biomedical field for various human implants. Four 
general types of bioceramics or bioglass as implant materials are 
identified and their different attachments in Fig. 1-12 [102] and Table 1-7 
[103-105].  
 
Fig. 1-12 Bioactivity spectrum for various bioceramic implants [102]

K+ with H+ or H3O+ from solution, then Na+ would dissolve onto material 
surface to form a SiO2-rich gel layer, where bone cells proliferate to 
become collagen after implanting into living body. Finally, calcium and 
phosphorus ions dissolve out of glass and form a CaO-P2O5-rich layer 
whose collagens gradually become the crystallization of hydroxyapatite. 
Once contacting hydroxyapatite, osteoblasts secrete bone matrix and then 
calcify. In this way, the calcified products combine bone tissues to be 
regeneration bone [107]. For the surface activity of materials, the glass 
also can be called as surface active bioceramic.  
 
Although the biocompatibility and bioactive of bioglass is very 
excellent, it still couldn’t be applied in clinical field for its poor 
mechanical properties. Therefore, many compositions and different heat 
treatment of bioglass was produced to obtain good mechanical hardness 
during 1970s and 1980s. In 1973, Bromer et al. developed “ceravital” 
[108] with the composition of Na2O-K2O-MgO-CaO-SiO5-P2O5 which is 
under heat treatment after melting and rapid cooling (quenching). Owing 
to crystallization by heat treatment, ceravital is with higher mechanical 
properties, but low bioactivity. Recently, as the material technology 
progresses step by step, the microstructure of material can be control 
more exactly. Besides, Kokubo [109], in the same time, used the 
compacting and sintering of glass powders to make a high dense sintered 
material, called as A-W bioglass or bioceramics (because its crystallized 
phase is apatite and wollastonite). This dense material can endure 
relatively high mechanical stress, often approaches to 200 MPa.  
 
Till 1982, M. H. Hon et al. [110] developed high strength 
biodegradable bioglass and bioceramics composed of 8.4 wt. % Na2O, 40 
wt. % CaO, 12 wt. % P2O5 and 39.6 wt. % SiO2, called as DP-Bioglass. 
When increasing the ratio of Ca, P, Na, the effect of biodegradable can be 
achieved easily. If appropriate heat treatments for nucleation and 
crystallization applied, the initial flexural strength can reach to 190 MPa. 
Further researches for animal test have been conducted, and the 
outstanding results for biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradable 
properties of DP-Bioglass have been proved, even no cytotoxicity in 
initial verification. Hence, this study utilizes DP-Bioglass doping some 
magnetic materials to synthesize magnetic bioglass particles for 
hyperthermia.

1.9 Purpose of study 
 
Regardless of Fe3O4 or γ-Fe2O3, iron oxide is the main thermoseed 
for magnetically mediated hyperthermia nowadays. Then by means of 
surface modification and grafting some special antibodies or functional 
groups, these iron oxide particles have the ability to target cancer cells 
selectively. However, iron oxide is a kind of ceramic that is very stable in 
the human body. In this way, choosing biodegradable materials as 
implantation for hyperthermia are the optimum. At the same time, 
bioactive and biocompatibility are also the important factors that need to 
be considerate. Hence, we use DP-Bioglass, which is with excellent 
properties of bioactive, biocompatibility and biodegradable, and dope 
magnetic materials as thermoseed for hyperthermia.  
 
Although it seems workable to add magnetic materials into bioglass 
for hyperthermia, it is hard to make magnetic glass with good magnetic 
behaviors (larger hysteresis loop area for larger heat product) actually. 
The hysteresis loop of bioglass doped iron ions can be found to be very 
slight. Because this is an ineluctable contradictory between glass structure 
and magnetic properties, we try to find a receivable balance to reduce the 
conflict of bioglass and magnetic properties.  
 
In other words, modifying the poor magnetic properties of bioglass 
with only iron ions is the purpose of the study. By adding a rare earth 
element – neodymium (Nd) into bioglass, we hope to synthesize magnetic 
bioglass particles with an increased area of hysteresis loop that has ability 
to generate enough heat to raise body temperature to 42~47℃ in an 
alternative magnetic field and with biodegradable properties.

              I = - e / (one circle time) = - eω/ 2pi 
Then 
µorb = I (pi r2 ) = - eωr2 / 2 
Owing to orbital angular momentum L is 
                     L = (me V) r = m e ω r2 
So we can get orbital magnetic dipole moment, also called orbital 
magnetic moment 
µorb  = - (e/2me) L 
 
The above formula with negative sign indicates that the direction of 
orbital magnetic moment is opposite to L and due to the negative charge 
of the electron. Moreover, we could discover that orbital magnetic 
moment is proportional to orbital angular momentum though a factor that 
is the ratio of electron charge to electron mass. This factor, e/2me, is 
called gyromagnetic ratio [120]. 
 
There is something we should notice and make a statement. In spite 
of the words “orbit” or “orbital” we have used, actually electrons do not 
orbit the nucleus. It can be explained by quantum physics further. 
 
Spin magnetic dipole moment 
 
 
Fig. 2-2 The spin of the electron produces a magnetic moment [119]. 
 
There is still another intrinsic angular momentum S, called spin 
angular momentum or just spin (Fig. 2-2 [119]). The spin of the electron 
would also generate a spin magnetic moment µspin. By advanced

2.2 Classification of magnetism 
 
After introducing the concept magnetic moment, it is more facile to 
talk about kinds of magnetism. Generally speaking, there are five 
magnetisms of materials: diamagnetism, paramagnetism, 
antiferromagnetism, ferromagnetism, and ferrimagnetism. Table 2-1 gives 
a brief summary of the magnetic properties of the materials [122]. 
 
Table 2-1 Classification of magnetic materials [122] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 - 35 - 
Paramagnetism 
 
For paragmagnetic materials, the spin and orbital magnetic moments 
of the electrons in every atom do not cancel out but vectorally combine to 
get a net magnetic moment. Without an external magnetic field, these 
magnetic moments orient randomly and give no net magnetic moment. 
However, if there is an external magnetic field, these magnetic moments 
in the materials tend to align in the same direction of the external 
magnetic field [128], as shown in Fig. 2-4 [130]. In this way, these total 
aligned magnetic moments sum a net magnetic moment. It is different 
form diamagnetic materials that tend to align magnetic moments to an 
opposite direction. For paramagnetic material, it usually exhibits 
paramagnetism independent of temperature [129] like some transition 
elements, rare earth elements, and actinide elements. Another kind of 
paramagnetic materials that is originally ferromagnetic, ferromagnetic or 
antiferromagnetic but subsequently above Curie temperature TC would 
make a description later. 
 
 
Fig. 2-4 (a) A paramagnetic material, each individual atom possesses a 
permanent magnetic moment, but due to thermal agitation there 
is no average moment per atom (b) In the presence of an applied 
magnetic field, individual magnetic moments take alignments 
along the applied field [130]. 
 
 - 37 - 
Ferromagnetism 
 
Ferromagnetic materials [135] such as transition metals iron, cobalt 
and nickel or rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium under room 
temperature are the most well-known magnetic materials in earth. 
Although there are many magnetic moments in the materials without 
aligning to the same direction, ferromagnetic materials still possess 
permanent magnetizations without any applied magnetic field. However, 
when a magnetic material is applied an adequate magnetic filed, its 
magnetic moments would align in the same direction along the direction 
of applied magnetic field, shown in Fig. 2-6 [140]. It means that the 
material is saturated magnetizing. The origin of ferromagnetism is 
exchange interaction [136-137] (we talk later) from the concept of 
quantum physics. When taking a look at the crystal structure of Fe, we 
can discover that there are many regions with magnetic ordering which is 
of all magnetic moments aligned the same direction, called magnetic 
domain [138]. It is an important phenomenon for magnetic materials, and 
discussed later. Ferromagnetic materials also show a different property 
depend on temperature. As long as above the critical temperature TC, 
called Curie temperature [139], materials become paramagnetic from 
ferromagnetic owing to thermal energy. 
 
Fig. 2-6 In a magnetized region of a ferromagnetic material, all magnetic 
moments are spontaneously aligned in the same direction [140]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 - 39 - 
2.3 Properties of magnetic materials 
 
Magnetic origin and exchange interaction 
 
Magnetic materials can exhibit permanent magnetization even in 
absence of applied magnetic field because of (1) magnetic moments and 
(2) a quantum physicals effect called exchange coupling or exchange 
interaction. [144] 
 
The magnetic moment exists in an atom when there are unpaired 
electrons. An atom with an odd number of electrons carries one at least. 
But these electrons in most materials usually form covalent bonds or 
enter broad bands. Exceptions are the transition or rare earth elements, 
owing to their unpaired electrons reside in the inner shell. So these 
electrons cannot participate in the bonging totally and generate the 
magnetic moments [145-147]. 
 
 
Fig. 2-8 Schematic variation of exchange constant [136] 
 
Magnetic moments may cancel out if their directions are not aligned. 
In fact, the electron spins of an atom interact with those of neighboring 
atom, so the magnetic moments of the atom tend to align parallel but 
random. The energy of exchange interaction forms an important part of 
the total energy of molecules and of covalent bond in many solid. From 
 - 41 - 
It is interesting to know the interface between two magnetic domains. 
We call the interface as domain walls and imagine the rotation of the 
directions of magnetic moments to be 180° abruptly. In fact, it can be 
seen that the neighboring magnetic moments are gradually rotated over 
several hundred atomic spacings. It is because exchange forces between 
two magnetic domains favor very little relative rotation. The concept of 
the structure of the domain walls were proposed by Bloch in 1932, and 
domain walls also are called Bloch walls [150]. The structure of domain 
wall can be seen in Fig. 2-10 [119]. 
 
Fig. 2-10 The magnetic moments in adjoining atoms change direction 
continuously across the boundary between domains [119]. 
 
Hysteresis and magnetostatic energy [151-153] 
 
Suppose that we put a magnetic material under applied magnetic 
field that gradually increases along one direction, labeled as positive 
x-axis. When the applied magnetic field becomes larger and larger, the 
magnetic domains start to move and to orient their magnetic moments 
along the direction of the applied magnetic field. Once when the all the 
magnetic moments tend to align in the same direction parallel to applied 
magnetic field, shown in Fig. 2-11 [154], under the increase of applied 
magnetic field, saturated magnetization Ms of the material can be seen.  
 
As we decrease and remove the applied magnetic field, magnetic 
moments would start to rotate in different directions. It is interesting that 
if the applied magnetic field becomes zero, there is still a residual 
magnetization in the material, as illustrated in Fig. 2-12 [155]. If we 
apply a magnetic field in the reverse direction, labeled as negative x-axis, 
 - 43 - 
accompanies energy loss, called hysteresis loss [159], when the 
hysteresis loop is produced by an alternating magnetic field. The energy 
of hysteresis loos can be calculated by integration of area of the hysteresis 
loop. Generally speaking, the area of hysteresis loop (W) can be 
expressed by the equation W= ∮ B dH, where B and H are the 
magnetization and applied magnetic field. For the area of a closed loop, it 
means how much energy is dissipated per unit volume of material. Based 
on the behavior of B-H hysteresis loop, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic 
materials can be classified into two types: soft and hard magnets [160].  
 
Soft and hard magnets 
 
 
Fig. 2-13 Soft and hard magnetic materials [119] 
 
Soft magnets and hard magnets can be categorized by the area size 
of hysteresis loop, not by hardness. By applied magnetic field, soft 
magnets with magnetic domain walls easily moved. It means that soft 
magnetic materials are easy to magnetize and demagnetize. Therefore, it 
only needs quite lower applied magnetic field. However, hard magnets 
are hard to magnetize and demagnetize due to less mobile magnetic 
domains. By this way, it requires higher applied magnetic field. Fig. 2-13 
[119] can show the comparison of typical hysteresis loop for soft and 
hard magnets. It can be seen that soft magnets are with small hysteresis 
loss and relatively hard magnets are with large hysteresis loss [160]. 
 
 
 - 45 - 
Hard magnets  
 
Ideal hard magnets are consists of some conditions: very large 
coercivity and residual magnetization. Furthermore, the area of hysteresis 
loop should be as large as possible for utilizing the large energy stored 
per unit volume as permanent magnets. The energy of hysteresis loop can 
be defined by the maximum value of the product BH, often denoted as 
(BH)max
  
in the second quadrant of B-H hysteresis loop. Fig. 2-14 [119] 
shows the rectangular of (BH)max
  
in hysteresis loop. 
 
 
Fig. 2-14 Hard magnetic materials and (BH)max [119] 
 
There are two main types of hard magnets, one is conventional hard 
magnetic materials and another one is high-energy hard magnetic 
materials [162]. For conventional hard magnetic materials, their (BH)max 
values are between 2 and 80 kJ/m3. Cunife (Cu-Ni-Fe) alloys, Alnico 
(AL-Ni-Co) alloys and hexagonal ferrite (BaO-6Fe2O3) are the typical 
conventional hard magnetic materials. For high-energy hard magnetic 
materials, their (BH)max values are above 80 kJ/m3 (10 MGOe) 
approximately. The most typical developed materials are samarium-cobalt 
(Sm-Co) magnets and neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) magnets, shown 
in Table 2-3 [122]. Although Sm-Co alloys have very large (BH)max 
values, Samarium is a relative rare and expensive metal. Hence, Nd-Fe-B 
alloys are another proper choice of hard magnetic materials. For the 
viewpoint of hyperthermia, it needs materials under external alternative 
 - 47 - 
2.4 Heat origins of magnetic hyperthermia 
 
The mechanism of heat generation in hyperthermia depends on the 
size (bulks or particles) and magnetic microstructure of materials. It can 
be separated by two groups: multi-domains and single-domain magnetic 
materials [163]. 
 
Multi-domains magnetic materials 
 
Magnetically-mediated hyperthermia originally performs by using 
multi-domains bulk or particles. The heat generation of multi-domains 
ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials is mainly due to hysteresis loss 
[159]. When the magnetic materials are under an alternative magnetic 
field, magnetic moments rotate and domain walls move. The stored 
energy dissipates and the surrounding temperature rises. If the magnetic 
materials are electrical conductors, the induced currents, called as eddy 
current [164], would be occurred. The heat loss can be computed from the 
equation of Joule heating: I2R, where I is induced current and R is 
material resistance. And multi-domains magnetic materials are used in the 
study. 
 
Single-domain magnetic materials  
 
Recently, nanotechnology and drug delivery has developed maturely 
so that utilizing single-domain magnetic nanoparticles as a thermal origin 
become a potential and popular issue. As the size of magnetic particles 
down to a particular range, the inner magnetic microstructure would 
change from multi-domains to single domain. The magnetic material with 
only one domain shows a special and distinct magnetism, often called as 
superparamagnetism [165], and excellent magnetic properties, like high 
magnetic saturation and susceptibility [166-169]. Because 
superparamagnetic particles are without any magnetic domain walls, they 
don’t possess heat due to hysteresis loss under an alternative magnetic 
field. However, the applied alternative magnetic field helps magnetic 
moments of materials rotate. When magnetic moments rotate, the energy 
barrier should be overcome. As soon as the orientations of magnetic 
moments relax to their equilibrium, the energy would dissipate and 
temperature rises. This is called as Néel relaxation [170]. Besides, 
 - 49 - 
2.5 Magnetocrystalline anisotropy and amorphous materials 
 
The materials would exhibit several kinds of magnetic anisotropy: 1. 
Crystal anisotropy also called magnetocrystalline anisotropy 2. Shape 
anisotropy 3. Stress anisotropy 4. Anisotropy induced by magnetic 
annealing, plastic deformation and irradiation 5. Exchange anisotropy 
[173]. However, only crystal anisotropy is an intrinsic property and the 
others can be thought as extrinsic properties. In this following content, 
only crystal or magnetocrystalline anisotropy will be mentioned.  
 
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy means that magnetic properties show 
different results along different crystal directions. In the example of iron, 
which has a body-centered cubic structure, the alignment of magnetic 
moments are more easier in 〈100〉directions than 〈110〉 and 〈111〉
directions [174], shown in Fig. 2-16 (a). Hence, a smaller applied 
magnetic field is required as the filed direction is along to〈100〉directions, 
also called as easy axis or easy direction. On the other hand, when an 
external magnetic filed is applied in〈111〉directions, the magnetization of 
BCC iron is accomplished by a stronger magnetic field. We often call
〈111〉directions as a hard axis or hard direction. Another example about 
magnetization and magnetic anisotropy shows in Fig. 2-16 (b). It is the 
single crystal of nickel that has face-centered cubic structure [175].  
 
What is the reason for the difference of magnetic anisotropy? 
Apparently, the applied field (not along to easy direction) has to do more 
work against the anisotropy force to align magnetic moments away from 
an easy direction. So it suggests that the required excess energy can be 
stored in the materials and the energy is called as magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy energy or crystal anisotropy energy [176]. This concept can 
be introduced to explain why amorphous materials (or glass) usually are 
designed as soft magnetic materials. It is because amorphous materials 
have no crystal structure, no magnetocrystalline anisotropy exists, which 
implies that all the directions are easy axis. Moreover, the lack of 
crystalline defects that hinder the motion of magnetic domain wall [173, 
177]. Therefore, amorphous materials typically is of little hysteresis loop 
owing to the deficiency of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and crystalline 
defects. The study for hyperthermia is to find out a useful and workable 
magnetic bioglass as thermal source.

3.3 Experiment flow chart 
 
Fig. 3-1 shows overall experimental procedures divided into two parts: 
material analysis and biotest. The material analysis includes magnetic 
properties (SQUID), crystallization (XRD), size distribution (Zetasizer), 
morphology of particles and material composition (SEM/EDS). The 
biotest contains the ability to biodegrade, cell viability (MTT), and 
cytotoxicity (LDH).  
 
    SQUID for the measure of magnetic properties can analyze the 
hysteresis loop. If materials without hysteresis loop mean that they are 
not ferrimagnetic materials, the magnetism can be known by SQUID. The 
measure of material crystallization by XRD can make sure whether the 
materials are glass. In order to confirm the particle size, Zetasizer can be 
used. The morphology and element component of magnetic bioglass 
particles can be pictured and detected by SEM and EDS.  
 
    If the magnetic bioglass particles are put into an acid solution, the 
ability to biodegrade can be evaluated by measure the release 
concentration of ions. Of course, MTT test is the basic and simple method 
to check cell viability when bioglass particles exist. LDH test is utilized 
for estimating the toxicity of bioglass particles.

4.1.2 Magnetic property 
 
I. Bioglass with fixed 6 wt. % Nd and different amounts of Fe 
 
    First, bioglass with fixed Nd amount (6 wt. %) and various amounts 
of iron were measured for their hysteresis loop. Bioglass with 6 wt. % Nd 
only shows paramagnetism, shown in Fig. 4-6. Moreover, Fig. 4-7 and 
4-8 represent that bioglass are with Nd/Fe ratio two and one respectively. 
Fig. 4-8 is the control experiment for bioglass with 6 wt. % Fe only. 
Obviously, 1Nd-1Fe bioglass has much larger hysteresis loop than 
1Nd-0.5Fe bioglass. And all these two components of Nd-Fe systems 
increase their own hysteresis loop compared to bioglass with Fe only. 
However, all the hysteresis loops are still too little to have enough 
hysteresis loss.
