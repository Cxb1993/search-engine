element analysis (FEA). A prototypical HCPV system design being developed at the National 
Central University was applied in the current study to simulate the structural deformation 
under two different conditions, namely, no wind and wind speed of 17.2 m/s. Furthermore, 
the misalignment of solar radiation for Fresnel lenses caused by the structural deformation of 
the HCPV system was also calculated.  
In order to verify the validity of the constructed FEA model, the simulation results were 
made a comparison with the measurements of strain change at certain locations in the given 
HCPV system during field operation. The trend of the strain variation with the elevation angle 
in the simulation agreed with that in the measurement. Such an agreement validates the 
constructed FEA model in simulation of the structural deformation for the given HCPV 
system. Based on the von Mises criterion, no failure was predicted for all the structural 
components in the given HCPV system.  
The maximum misalignment values of solar radiation were 0.19o and 0.48o for the 
conditions of gravity effect alone and wind speed of 17.2 m/s, respectively. These values were 
all below the acceptable values 0.5o for a highly efficient HCPV system. Therefore, the given 
HCPV system can normally operate under a wind speed of 17.2 m/s without significant 
degradation of efficiency in power generation. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) which uses lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight 
onto solar cells has been proposed in 1970s [1,2]. The concept is that a larger area of III-V 
multi-junction solar cell is replaced by a less expensive optical element [1-3]. In this way, the 
cost of electricity generated can be reduced by using a smaller cell area. In other words, the 
same expense can obtain more electricity generated. In recent studies, the concentration ratio 
has reached 300 to 1000 [3-5]. Therefore, the CPV with such a concentration ratio or higher is 
also called high concentrated photovoltaics (HCPV). 
Because the HCPV has such a high concentration ratio, it needs to keep the lens directed 
toward the sun and the cell in focus [2]. For this reason, an HCPV system always needs to 
face orthogonally the sun. Hence, an HCPV system is usually equipped with a precise solar 
tracker to track the position of the sun. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects 
4 
Structural deformation in both the solar tracker and photovoltaic concentrators were 
calculated. Because the numerical simulation did not consider the clearances of the driving 
gears in the solar tracker, the driving components of the azimuth rotation and altitude rotation 
were neglected in this study. Fillets, chamfers, and drill holes in the components were also 
neglected to simplify the analysis. A 3-D solid model was thus constructed for calculating 
structural deformation of the HCPV system at various elevation angles. Schematic of the FEA 
model used in calculating the structural deformation at an elevation angel of 60o is shown in 
Fig. 2 as an example for such simulations. There are three main components in the HCPV 
system, including a solar tracker, two arrays of photovoltaic concentrators and a position 
sensitive detector (PSD). The size of an array of photovoltaic concentrators is 1338.4 × 555.4 
× 246 mm3. A complete FEA model was meshed with about 695,447 elements and 1,113,103 
nodes.

2.3 Investigated Cases 
 
In this study, two kinds of situations have been simulated. The first case considered the 
HCPV system operating without wind effect. This means that only the gravity caused the 
structural deformation of the HCPV system. The other case considered the HCPV system 
6 
locations in the solar tracker and Fresnel lens during field operation.  Strain gage S1 was 
pasted on the horizontal axis to measure the axial strain at the location shown as Fig. 4(a).  
The other two strain gages were pasted on a Fresnel lens to measure the strains at the location 
shown as Fig. 4(b).  One strain gage (S2) was pasted on the center of the Fresnel lens and the 
other (S3) was pasted on the frame of the Fresnel lens.  A strainmeter was equipped to 
process the signals from the strain gages and an anemometer was used to measure the wind 
speed and wind direction.  Both the strainmeter and anemometer were connected with a data 
acquisition system and a personal computer.

4. Results and Discussion 
 
4.1 Effect of Weight Only 
 
Figure 5 shows the calculated and measured strain change (S1) of the horizontal axis as 
a function of elevation angle.  The strain increment at elevation angle of 0o was zero, as the 
strain value was reset to zero at this elevation angle followed by rotating the solar tracker 
around the horizontal axis to measure the changes of strain value at various elevation angles.  
The calculated strain increment was obtained by subtracting the calculated strain at elevation 
angle of 0o from that of each other specified elevation angle.  The measured results show 
that the axial strain was increased with elevation angle.  At elevation angle of 90o, the strain 
increment had a largest value of 103 μm/m because the weight of the two arrays of 
8 
than that at 0o by an amount of 3 μm/m and 4 μm/m, respectively.  The simulation 
overestimated the strain decrement at the locations S2 and S3 on an Fresnel lens by an extent 
of 85% and 83%, respectively.  Such a great extent of overestimate might be caused by 
neglecting the stress concentration effect of the groove facet on the Fresnel lens.

Figure 7 shows the calculated von Mises equivalent stress in the horizontal axis for 
elevation angle of 0o.  The maximum von Mises equivalent stress occurred at the intersection 
of the axis and the key close to the worm wheel.  The maximum von Mises equivalent stress 
value at elevation angle of 0o was greater than those at the other elevation angles.  Because 
the two arrays of photovoltaic concentrators were located at the front side of the horizontal 
axis at elevation angle of 0o, their weight caused a largest combination of torque (x-axis 
moment) and bending moment (z-axis moment) acting on the horizontal axis (along x-axis) 
than did at the other elevation angles.  The weight of the photovoltaic concentrators was 
distributed on both sides of the horizontal axis at elevation angle of 90o.  For this reason, the 
weight was more balanced and caused a smaller combination of torque and bending moment 
at elevation angle of 90o.  Therefore, the maximum von Mises equivalent stress in the 
horizontal axis at elevation angle of 0o was greater than those at the other elevation angles.

Fig. 11  Maximum misalignment of solar radiation for the Fresnel lenses and the 
corresponding row and column numbers at various elevation angles for a wind 
speed of 17.2 m/s. 
 
Figure 12 shows the comparison of the maximum misalignment of solar radiation for the 
investigated two cases, namely, no wind and wind speed of 17.2 m/s.  The results show that 
the maximum misalignment value was increased with wind speed at a given elevation angle.  
At elevation angles of 80o and 90o, the maximum misalignment values were almost the same 
for these two cases because the area against the wind was smaller than those at the other 
elevation angles.  Therefore, the wind loads acting on the array were small at these two 
elevation angles.  For this reason, the wind loads did not have a large influence on the 
misalignment of solar radiation at these elevation angles such that the structural deformation 
and misalignment of solar radiation were dominated by the weight of the components.  The 
largest misalignment angle of all the conditions considered in the current study is 0.48o which 
is below the acceptable value, 0.5o.  Therefore, the given HCPV system can normally 
operate under a wind speed of 17.2 m/s without significant degradation of efficiency in power 
generation.
