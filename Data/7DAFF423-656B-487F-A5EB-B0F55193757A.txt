1. Introduction 
 
To gain thermodynamic advantages, modern gas turbine engines operate at entry temperatures of about 1800-2000 K 
that are far above the melting points of blade materials. Hot components of a gas turbine engine require efficient 
cooling schemes to prevent thermal and mechanical failures in order to meet the safety standards with acceptable lives. 
Among these hot components, the largest mechanical loads with harsh thermal environments act upon the turbine rotor 
blades. It is now an essential practice to incorporate complex internal cooling passages inside the turbine rotor blade. 
The ultimate goal of blade design is to improve the turbine aerodynamic performance with the coolant consumption 
reduced which therefore calls a variety of surface enhancements for heat transfer augmentations inside these internal 
cooling passages. The understanding of the complex turbulent flow fields and heat transfer performances associated 
with each heat transfer enhancement technique for these rotating passages is a primary concern for academic and 
industrial communities. However, the complex flow features as well as the harsh thermal environment and especially 
the extremely high rotational speeds have prohibited the fast progress in the numerical and experimental studies that 
attack the heat transfer problems inside the rotating passages running at the engine conditions. 
 
Evaluations of flow and heat transfer inside rotor blades have to consider three additional body forces induced by 
rotation which act on fluids in addition to the complex cooling geometries. Two of these are concerned with the well 
known Coriolis and centrifugal forces which, for a constant rotational speed, act simultaneously with the flow field 
driven by pressure gradients and interact with the surface roughness to form the rich modes of flow structures inside 
rotating coolant passages. The third component of body force, which is often discarded from investigations, results 
from the rate of angular velocity change due to the acceleration or deceleration of rotor. Relevant studies of rotating 
turbulent flows can trace back to the early researches of meteorological phenomena that explore the effects of Coriolis 
forces on flows due to the extra strain rate generated by earth rotation. Bradshaw formulates an analogy between the 
meteorological parameters and the parameters describing the orthogonal-mode rotation [1]. As the orthogonal mode 
rotation is perpendicular to the plane of main shear, Coriolis forces provide considerable effects on the mean flow as 
well as on turbulent fluctuations. In the respect of Coriolis effects on mean flows, the Coriolis forces establish cross 
stream secondary flows which drive the relatively cool fluids from the channel core towards the unstable wall that 
return to the stable wall after washing the peripheries of a rotating channel. As the production of turbulence in the near 
wall region and in the shear layers of a channel flow is triggered by the momentum exchange through intensive 
interactions between the fluctuating streamwise and cross-stream velocities, turbulent activities are augmented when 
Coriolis forces act in tandem with these events but are attenuated when the two act in opposition [2]. The Coriolis 
effects on turbulences are manifested by stabilizing and destabilizing fluctuating activities at the stable and unstable 
walls respectively. Further increasing the rotation rate, the large scale roll cells induced by Taylor-Görtler instability 
are established over the cross sectional plane of a rotating channel [3,4]. An analogy between the effects induced by 
surface curvature and orthogonal mode rotation in turbulent flows has proposed by Ishigaki [5] that demonstrates such 
flow is unstable as the direction of rotation is in tandem with the angular velocity, while the flow is stable if the 
directions are opposing. In particular, as the mean vorticity component is perpendicular to the rotating axis in an 
orthogonally rotating channel, this type of turbulent flow becomes very sensitive to the rotation. Even though a weak 
rotation can induce a significant spanwise mean-velocity that deviates the mean flow from the static condition, which 
makes all the Reynolds stress tensor non-zero and redirects the mean shear and the turbulent structure [6]. Convective 
heat transfer coefficients over the unstable wall of a rotating passage are consequently improved in relation to that 
over the stable wall due to the Coriolis force effects. 
 
Another rotational manifestation in the coolant passages is the centrifugal acceleration that can be up to 105 g in a 
rotor blade. For isothermal flows, the centrifugal force remains hydrostatic, but the interaction between centrifugal 
acceleration and density gradients of fluids, resulting from temperature differences, motivates the warmer and 
therefore the less dense regions of fluids towards the axis of rotation. Such mechanism referring to as the rotating 
buoyancy effect depends markedly on the direction of the through flow that alters the heat transfer phenomena and 
distorts the velocity and temperature distributions with turbulent structures modified. Morris [7] advocated the 
significance of rotating buoyancy effects and demonstrated that the rotating buoyancy has an advantageous effect on 
heat transfer for radially inward flow but an adverse effect for radially outward flow. Their earlier rotational 
experiments [8] with the Re range of 5000-15000 found that the buoyancy interactions impair local heat transfer for

2. Experimental Details 
2.1 Facilities 
 
The rotating test rig was designed to create a rotating platform on which the assorted simulated blade cooling passages 
could be mounted and tested. Layouts of this rotating test rig along with its instrumentations for the measurements of 
flow, heat-flux and temperature as well as the method of data acquisition have been previously reported [30]. This 
rotating test rig was commissioned to perform high pressure tests up to 8 bars in order to extend the Ro ranges 
attainable. Test pressures of present study are controlled in the range of 2.3-2.6 bars to allow for the full coverage of 
present test conditions. A 413 mm long heat transfer test module was mounted on the platform of the rotating rig that 
gave the a midspan eccentricity (R) of 370 mm for the test section at the rotational speed up to 800 rev/min. The test 
coolant of pressurized airflow is supplied by two screw-type compressors from an air tank. The coolant is 
dehumidified and cooled to the ambient temperature prior to entering the air tank. The test airflow is channeled 
through a set of pressure regulator and filter, a pressure transducer, a mass flow meter and a needle valve that controls 
the mass flow rate of coolant feeding into the heat transfer test module. Mass flow rates of test coolant are frequently 
adjusted to compensate the changes of fluid properties due to temperature variations in the attempt to control Re and 
Ro with maximum deviations of +1% from the targeting values at the flow entrance of test section.  
 
The heat transfer test module with airflow in the radially outward direction is depicted in Fig. 1-a with enlarged details 
of the scale roughened surface in Fig. 1-b. The trapezoidal sectioned test channel is made up of leading (1) and trailing 
(2) heated walls, together with two thermally insulated tufnol sidewalls (3)(4). These two scale-roughened bevel walls 
(1)(2) are made of two stainless steel plates of dimensions 240 × 80 × 3 mm and electrically heated by two 0.5 mm 
thick Minco thermal foils (5)(6) sandwiched between the tufnol bottom plates (7)(8) and the tufnol sidewalls (3)(4) 
which generate two basically uniform heat flux heating surfaces. Each Minco thermal foil is attached to the back flat 
surface of the roughened steel plate by the forces generated from a series of axial bolts along the test channel. Because 
the scaled roughness are machined from the stainless steel material of thermal conductivity 15 Wm-1K-1, the heat 
transfer data generated by the present study represents the average Nusselt number at each axial location. Each of 
these two heating foils (5)(6) gives the active heating length of 240 mm. The material of tufnol used is capable of 
sustaining 2500C with the thermal conductivity of 0.5 Wm-1K-1. The surface areas of all the deepened scales are taken 
into account for the heating area in order to evaluate the realistic heat flux. The electrical heating power is supplied via 
a Variac transformer with the power consumption metered by a Wattmeter. Adjustments of heating power vary the 
relative strength of buoyancy level at each flow condition tested.  
 
Two pairs of opposite bevel walls (1)(2) and side walls (3)(4) are physically held together by means of a series of axial 
bolts to form the trapezoidal sectioned channel with the hydraulic diameter (d) of 30 mm. The complete set of the 
trapezoidal test section is tightened between the end and top flanges (9)(10) by four draw-bolts. A needle valve (11) is 
fitted on the exit flow passage through the end flange (10) so that the pressure inside the rotating channel is adjusted in 
order to simultaneously control Re and Ro at the predefined test values. Air leakage from each jointed surface is 
prevented by means of a series of internal 'O' ring seals and high temperature sealants. A cylindrical shield (12) is 
fitted between the end and top flanges with thermally insulated fiber filled between the test section and the shield in 
order to minimize the external heat loss. The extent and characteristics of external heat loss are acquired by means of 
the series of heat loss calibrations tests that are individually performed. The complete set of heat transfer test module 
is vertically mounted onto the rotating platform with the dynamic balance ensured. 
 
At the entrance of the scale roughened channel, several layers of fine mesh (13) are installed inside the entry plenum 
chamber (14). Abrupt flow entrance for the trapezoidal test section is formulated with the abrupt area ratio of 3. 
Thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers develop simultaneously at the immediate entrance of the test section. 
Entry air temperature is measured by a type K thermocouple (15) penetrating into the entry plenum chamber. Fluid 
properties used to evaluate Re and Ro for controlling the test conditions are based on the measured air inlet 
temperatures. At the exit plane of the rotating trapezoidal channel, three type K thermocouples (16) penetrate into the 
test channel and allocate along the midline at three different spanwise locations with equal interval as indicated in Fig. 
1-a. The fluid bulk temperature (Tb) at the exit plane of the test channel is obtained by averaging these three 
temperature measurements (16). Inside the test section, there is no thermocouple penetrating into the flow pathway to 
avoid the disturbance of flow field. The enthalpy balance is therefore accounted to determine the local Tb values at the 
axial locations where the wall temperatures are detected using the sequential integration method. The evaluated Tb 
value at the exit plane for each test condition is checked with the actual measurement. The agreement between the 
evaluated and measured exit Tb values confirms the accuracies of energy accountancies and measurements of mass 
flow rate. Such set of experimental raw data is acceptable for the subsequent data processing when the difference 
between the evaluated and measured exit Tb values is less than +10%.

corrected into the base-line surface as indicated in Fig. 1-b using one dimensional heat conduction law. As our 
previous study demonstrates that the heat-transfer and pressure-drop performances in the scaled roughened rectangular 
channel is directional [31], the forward flow configuration that offers the higher degree of heat transfer enhancement 
with the better thermal performance factor is adopted by the present study. The coordinate system in the streamwise (x) 
direction is selected along two mid-span centerlines of the bevel walls. It is worth noting that the peripheral heat 
transfer variation across each width of the scaled bevel wall, which reflects the effects of Coriolis secondary flows on 
heat transfer, is not examined due to the limitation proposed by the available channels of instrumentation slip-rings. 
The peripheral heat transfer variation over each cross-section of this scale-roughened trapezoidal rotating duct is not 
investigated.  
 
2.2 Parameters 
 
Variations of any governing dimensionless group, such as Re, Ro, Pr or Bu for a set of pre-defined channel and 
heating geometries alter the flow and temperature fields in the rotating channels. Within the tested Tb range, the 
maximum variation in Prandtl number (Pr) of test coolant is about 5.6 % and its effects on heat transfer are therefore 
disregarded from the present investigation. The strategic aim of present study is to disclose the functional relationship 
of Nusselt number as quoted in equation (1) for the rotating channel with the flow and thermal boundary conditions 
defined by the test configurations described in Fig. 1. 
 
Nu =  {Re, Ro, Bu, X}              (1) 
 
The experimentally defined Nusselt number (Nu) in equation (1) is calculated as: 
 
 w bNu qd k T T                   (2) 
 
In equation (2), the convective heat flux (q) is obtained by subtracting the external heat loss flux from the total heat 
flux supplied. The heating area selected to define the heat flux is the total surface area of the scaled surface that is 1.3 
times of the projected heating area over each scaled surface. Variations of wall temperature (Tw) over the scale 
roughened surface due to the various flow fields developed in the test channel result in spatial variations of the 
external heat loss flux and therefore the convective heat flux. The results of heat loss calibrations indicate that the heat 
loss flux increases linearly with the wall-to-ambient temperature difference. The proportionality between heat loss flux 
and wall-to-ambient temperature difference increases as the rotational speed of test channel increases. These heat loss 
proportionalities are correlated as the function of rotational speed that is incorporated into the data processing program 
to evaluate the local heat loss flux. A review of the entire data of convective heat flux indicates that the maximum heat 
loss is about 8.1 % of the total heat flux supplied taking place at the highest speed and Re tested with the maximum 
non-uniformity in heat flux distribution of about 9.18 %. This result confirms the basically uniform heat flux heating 
condition over two heating surfaces of the rotating test channel. Having defined the local convective heat flux at each 
axial spot where Tw is measured, the local enthalpy balance is accounted to determine the corresponding Tb value. All 
the fluid properties used to evaluate the dimensionless parameters in equation (1) are based on the local Tb value.  
 
A full coverage of the engine conditions for any rig simulation is extremely difficult due to the high rotational speeds 
of the gas turbine engine. The present approach for rig simulation is to increase the hydraulic diameter (d) and reduce 
the mean flow velocity (Wm) with the coolant mass flow rate unchanged by increasing the pressure of flow inside the 
rotating test channel. This attempt increases both Ro and Bu at any specified Re that successfully extends the present 
parametric ranges of rotating flows to a great extent from the past research experiences [7-11, 14-28] as indicated in 
Table 1. However, the maximum Re and Ro listed in Table 1 are not simultaneously attainable.

Fig. 3 Axial distributions of normalized 
Nusselt number (Nu/Re
n
) ratio along scale 
roughened wall in static channel with Re = 
5000, 7500, 10000 and 15000. 
 
The Nu0/Nu versus Re relationships at the axial stations depicted in Fig. 2 indicate that the correlation of Nu0 is no 
longer followed by the Re0.8 relationship but the exponent of Re is higher than 0.8 in the trapezoidal scale-roughened 
channel. Initially, the dependence of Nu0 on Re at each measurement station is individually examined that correlates 
Nu0 as the function of A(X)×Re
 n(X). It is interesting to note that the n exponents are respectively converged to 0.82 and 
0.84 for the scale and mid-scale locations; while the coefficients A(X) vary with the axial location (X) in reflection to 
the influences of abrupt entry entrance and the scale induced flow phenomena. Fig. 3 plots the scaled Nusselt number 
in terms of Nu0/Re
n along the centerlines of scale and mid-scale locations that shows the convergence of all the 
Nu0/Re
n data toward a tight data band at each measurement station. Two sets of streamwise data trends depicted in Fig. 
3 can be well captured by the exponential functions that are derived as: 
 
Nu0/Re
0.82 = 0.0404 +0.0165 e – 0.97 X   (Scale location)        (3) 
 
Nu0/Re
0.84 = 0.0497 + 0.0211e – 1.12 X   (Mid-scale location)       (4) 
 
All the heat transfer data generated from the static channel are converged within the maximum deviations of ± 3% 
with equations (3) and (4). These two static heat transfer correlations are taken as the references for assessing the 
effect of rotation on heat transfer in this trapezoidal scale-roughened channel. 
 
 
4.2 Rotational results and heat transfer correlation 
 
With the prescribed uniform heat flux thermal conditions over two scale roughened walls, the directional Coriolis 
forces toward the trailing bevel wall modify the flow structures in the static channel and break the axisymmetric axial 
wall temperature profiles with the higher Tw values constantly developed along the leading edge relative to its trailing 
counterparts. These wall temperature differences between leading and trailing edges proceed over the entire rotating 
trapezoidal channel which demonstrates the formation of cross-stream Coriolis secondary flows. However, due to the 
trapezoidal sectional shape of the rotating channel, the multiple pairs of Coriolis secondary flows are likely to be 
induced that convect the cool fluids from the duct-core toward the trailing wall with the heated confluent flows 
gathering on the leading surface. This flow feature is referred to as the Coriolis washing effect that can result in the 
considerable spanwise heat transfer variations across each leading or trialing bevel wall for this rotating trapezoidal 
channel. Due to the flow instability phenomena and the washing effect in association with the Coriolis forces, the 
relatively high local Nusselt numbers constantly develop along the trailing edge in comparison with their leading 
counterparts for all the rotating results as typified by Fig. 4. Additionally shown in Fig. 4 with Re = 10000 and Ro = 
0.3, three sets of descending axial heat transfer distributions driven by three ascending buoyancy levels (increasing 
Δρ/ρ ratios) along either the leading or the trailing edge reveal the noticeably impairing heat transfer effects due to the 
impacts of rotating buoyancy. The inclusion of axial Nu0/Nu∞ distribution as the zero-rotation reference in Fig. 4 
highlights the respective decrease and increase of heat transfer performances from the static level along the leading 
and trailing edges at this particular rotation number. It is interesting to note the different degrees of heat transfer 
elevations (reductions) form the static Nu0/Nu∞ references between the developing and developed flow regions along 
the trailing (leading) edge. The lager degree of Coriolis effects, which provide the heat transfer elevations along the 
trailing edges from the zero-rotation references to larger extents, initiates from the immediate flow entrance but

impractical from the direct heat transfer measurements as the finite wall-to-fluid temperature differences, and therefore 
the involvements of buoyancy interactions, are necessary in order to experimentally define Nusselt numbers. 
Nevertheless, it is a meaningful way to reveal the so called zero-buoyancy heat transfer data by extrapolating each Ro 
controlled data series as depicted in each individual plot of Fig. 6 to the limiting condition of Bu = 0 using the 
regressive type analysis. Such regression-type curve fitting process for each series of data trend with a finite rotation 
number can generate the Nu/Nu0 data corresponding to zero (Tw-Tb). This is also attempted in Fig. 6 as seen as the 
curve fitted lines that lead to the zero-buoyancy heat transfer levels by extrapolating the series of Nu/Nu0 data 
collected from fixed Ro toward their asymptotic values with zero Bu. As Bu increases, the linear-like decrease of 
Nu/Nu0 ratios is evident for each Ro controlled correlative line. The rotational heat transfer data in terms of Nu/Nu0 
ratio at the scale and mid-scale locations along leading and trailing edges in the developed flow region can accordingly 
be correlated by equation (5).

In equation (5),  1 and  2 are functions of Ro that vary with scale and mid-scale locations along leading and trailing 
edges in the developed flow region. The  1 function features the heat transfer performances in the rotating channel 
with isothermal flows that accounts for the sole Coriolis force effects on heat transfer. The various slopes of the 
correlating lines depicted in Fig. 6 are taken into account by  2 functions that indicate the various degrees of buoyancy 
impact on heat transfer. Negative sign of  2 value, as shown by each correlative line in Fig. 6, signifies the impairing 
effect on heat transfer with its magnitude to reflect the degree of rotating buoyancy impacts. The varying manners of  
2 values that decrease as Ro increases from 0.1 to 1.8 are followed by all the data series at the scale and mid-scale 
locations in the developed flow region. If such trend of reducing  2 magnitudes is followed as Ro further increases, 
the sign of  2 values can yield from negative to positive, indicating the reverse buoyancy effects from impairing to 
improving heat transfer. It is worth noting that the data convergence seen in all the plots of Fig. 6 reconfirms the 
applicability of scaling out Re dependency on rotational Nusselt number by presenting heat transfer data in terms of 
Nu/Nu0. Due to the existence of coupling effects between Coriolis force and rotational buoyancy, these  2 values 
deem to be the function of Ro. Table 2 summarizes the correlative  1 and  2 values at the scale and mid-scale 
locations along leading and trailing edges in the developed flow region of the present rotating channel.

The variations of  1 value against Ro at the scale and mid-scale locations along the leading and trailing edges in the 
developed flow region that reinstate the varying manners of the Ro controlled Coriolis force effects in isolation are 
revealed in Fig. 7. Without the buoyancy interaction, the data trends shown in Fig. 7 still follow the results typified in 
Fig. 5 which are subject to the coupled Ro and Bu effects. Acting by the Coriolis force alone, the heat transfer levels 
along leading edge are initially reduced from the zero-rotation references as Ro increases and lead to the minimum 
Nu/Nu0 ratios or the so-called worst heat transfer scenarios at Ro = 0.3. Further increase of Ro from 0.3 to 0.5 recovers 
the leading edge heat transfer that turns the Nu/Nu0 ratios along the leading edge to be greater than unity as Ro>0.5. At 
both scale and mid-scale locations along the trailing edge, the Nu/Nu0 ratios consistently increase as Ro increases.

discrete. Heat transfer augmentation for this class of
ﬂow is about 2–3.5 times of smooth-walled channel le-
vel. The ﬂow structure produced by dimpled surface is
characterized by vortical ﬂuid and vortex pairs those
periodically shed from each dimple. A large up-wash
region and packets of ﬂuid emanating from the central
regions of each dimple, accompanying with the periodi-
cally vortex shedding process, develop in the region near
the dimple diagonals. This complex three-dimensional
unsteady process results in the eﬀective heat transfer
enhancements over the ﬂat parts of the dimpled surface.
But the heat transfer elevation in the concave dimpled
surface is less eﬀective. It is noticed that here is no pro-
truding element over the concave dimpled surface.
Therefore, unlike the secondary ﬂows in a rectangular
channel with two opposite walls roughened by angled
ribs, the one-, two- or four-cell vortical ﬂows could
not be generated over the cross-section of a dimpled
channel. The absence of cross-plane large secondary
vortex structures could prohibit the further heat transfer
augmentation in a dimpled channel so that the spatially
averaged Nusselt numbers over a dimpled surface are in
the range of 1.85–2.89 times of the baseline Nusselt
number in smooth-walled channel [7]. Another surface
roughness that provides considerable heat transfer ele-
vation employs the wing-type longitudinal vortex gener-
ator. Longitudinal vorticies are generated along the side
edges of each vortex generator (VG) by separation of
ﬂow due to the pressure diﬀerence between the upstream
and downstream side of VG. These VG-induced vortices
swirl the main ﬂow to enhance the ﬂuid mixing close to
and far from the wall that results in the considerable
heat transfer augmentation [9]. However, due to the
large cost of ﬂow loss in VG channel, the two opposite
walls ﬁtted with VGs remains impractical on account
of ﬂow losses. An alternative approach by ﬁtting VGs
on one wall and rib-roughened surface on the opposite
wall for heat transfer augmentation has been numeri-
cally examined [10]. The ratios of Nusselt number and
friction coeﬃcient between VG enhanced surface and
smooth-walled channel were approximated in the ranges
of 2.9–3.41 and 22.5–32 respectively for airﬂow with
Reynolds numbers ranging from 25,000 to 150,000
[10]. In many applications such as the tail-end cooling
of gas turbine blade and automotive heat exchangers,
where the channel width-to-height ratio approaches
8:1, the transverse velocity induced by the angled ribs
over the cross-section of narrow channel becomes rela-
tively low compared with the mainstream velocity [11].
In the rectangular channels with width-to-height ratios
of 1/4, 2/1, 1, 2 and 4, the pressure drop increments
are about 8–16 times greater for the channel with
width-to-height ratio of 4 if the same level of heat trans-
fer augmentation is to be achieved [5]. Thus the thermal
performance of rib-roughened channel, compared withthe constant pumping power, decreases with the increaseschematics of test assembly depicts in Fig. 1a. The test
ﬂuid, pressurized air, was fed from the IWATA SC
175C screw-type compressor unit (1) which was dehu-
midiﬁed and cooled to the ambient temperature through
a refrigerating unit (2). The dry and cooled airﬂow was
channeled through a set of pressure regulator and ﬁlter
(3) with the mass ﬂow rate to be metered and adjusted
by the Tokyo Keiso TF-1120 mass ﬂow meter (4) and
the needle valve (5) respectively. The scale of present
mass ﬂow meter was 0.01 kg/h that incurred the maxi-
mum uncertainty for mass ﬂow measurement of about
0.257%. A digital-display pressure transducer (6) mea-
sured the pressure level of coolant ﬂow. Prior to entering
the test channel with two opposite walls roughened by
scales (7), the metered airﬂow was directed through a
smooth-walled 150 mm · 100 mm · 15 mm ﬂow-calm-
ing section (8). The ratio of cross-sectioned area between
test channel and ﬂow-calming section was 1.875, which
simulated the abrupt ﬂow entry condition. Dimensions
of test channel were 155 mm · 80 mm · 10 mm which
gives a channel aspect ratio of 8 and the hydraulic diam-
eter of 17.8 mm. The ﬂow-calming section was con-
structed by Teﬂon plates. A K-type thermocouple

of channel width-to-height ratio [1–10]. Although a large
store of information for heat transfer augmentation in
rib-roughened channels has been recorded in the last
decade, only relatively few studies attempt the channels
with width-to-height ratios in the range of 8–10
[3,8,11,12]. For cooling applications of electronic chip-
sets with intensiﬁed circuit densities in a Notebook
PC, which are strictly conﬁned by the available machine
height, the narrow channel becomes one remained op-
tion for heat sink design. However, justiﬁed by the re-
ported values of heat transfer augmentation and
thermal performance in the narrow channels from Sun-
den group [3,8,11], the higher levels of heat transfer aug-
mentation and thermal performance factor are requested
for cooling of gas turbine blade and CPU in a Notebook
PC. This need urges the development of new enhanced
surface using the scaled roughness arranged in the stag-
gered manner. No previously published work is avail-
able to examine the heat transfer performance in the
channel with two opposite walls roughened by scaled
surfaces. In this respect, the absence of research eﬀorts
and the possibility of wide industrial applications that
require strong stiﬀness for structure integrity have moti-
vated the present study.

The two opposite scale-roughened surfaces were elec-
trically heated by two 0.5 mm thick Minco thermal foils
sandwiched between Teﬂon bottom plate and scale-
roughened surface which generated the basically uni-
form heat ﬂux thermal condition. As pointed in Fig.
1b, K-type thermocouples with equal interval along
the centerline of a scale-roughened surface were installed
on the back face of the scale-roughened surface for wall-
temperature measurements. All the temperature mea-
surements were monitored and stored in a Dell PC using
a Net-Daq Fluke Hydra 2640A data logger for the sub-
sequent data processing. The wall-temperature measure-
ment at each axial station was corrected into the base-
line surface as indicated in Fig. 1b using the one-dimen-
sional heat conduction law. The origins of coordinate
systems for the forward and downward ﬂows, which in-
volved the streamwise (x) and spanwise (y) coordinates,
were selected at the middle span of two side entry edges.
It is worth mentioning that the wall-temperature varia-
tions over the scale-roughened surface were aﬀected by
the ﬂow ﬁelds in the test channel. As the external-heat
loss at each location over the roughened surface in-
creased with the increase of wall-to-ambient temperature
diﬀerence, the heat ﬂux over the heating foil was not per-
fectly uniform even if the heat ﬂux was uniformly gener-
ated by Minco heating foil. The distribution of
convective heat ﬂux was obtained by subtracting the lo-
cal heat loss from the total heat ﬂux supplied. Based onsequential energy balance method. This sequential en-
ergy accountancy calculated the ﬂow bulk temperatures
at the measured stations along the centerline of scale-
roughened surface. At the exit-end of scale-roughened
channel, three type K thermocouples, positioned with
equal spanwise interval, penetrated into the core of exit
guiding section (9) to measure the ﬂow exit temperature.
The ﬂow exit temperature was used to check for the
accuracy of energy accountancy based on the enthalpy
balance method. Data batch was collected when the dif-
ferences between the measured and calculated ﬂow bulk
temperatures were less than 10% at the exit plane.
Fig. 1b shows the geometrical details of the scale-
roughened surface. Each two rows of scales in the artiﬁ-
cially roughened surface were arranged in the staggered
manner. The two opposite scale-roughened walls were
in-line arrangement. The geometry of scaled surface
was speciﬁed in terms of four non-dimensional parame-
ters deﬁned in Fig. 1b of
scale angle of attack (a) = 11,
scale height/channel height ratio (e/H) = 1 mm/10

Dtainty about 0.062% for this series of tests. This arrange-ment for pressure drop measurements included the ﬂow
resistance in the developing ﬂow region. As the majority
of ﬂow region in the present scale-roughened channel for
CPU cooling applications was under developing, this
setup for pressure measurement provided an overall
indication of the ﬂow resistance in the entire scale-
roughened channel, which measurement was higher than
the developed ﬂow value.
2.2. Program and data processing
Heat transfer and pressure drop tests over the scale-
roughened surface were performed with the ﬂows direc-
ted in the forward and downward directions at Reynolds
numbers (Re) of 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10,000,
12,500 and 15,000. This selected Re range covered the
laminar and turbulent ﬂows. The streamwise heat trans-
fer distributions along the scale-roughened centerline
and pressure drops across the test channel at various
Reynolds numbers were examined. The manner by
which the ﬂow direction and Re aﬀected the local and
spatially averaged heat transfers and pressure drops
was analyzed. A comparison of heat transfer and fric-
tion augmentations between the data collected from a
variety of enhanced channels [1–8] and the present
scale-roughened channel was performed to unravel the
thermal performance of scale-roughened surface in nar-
row channel. Heat transfer and friction correlations
were subsequently derived for forward and downward
ﬂows in the present scale-roughened channel that per-
mitted the determination of local and spatially averagedP

the results of heat-loss calibrations, the external-heat
loss increased linearly with wall-to-ambient temperature
diﬀerence. The local heat loss was estimated by multiply-
ing the local wall-to-ambient temperature diﬀerence to
the heat loss coeﬃcient acquired from the heat loss cal-
ibrations. A review of the entire data of convective heat
ﬂux showed that the maximum non-uniformity in heat
ﬂux distribution was about 10.1%. The basically uni-
form heat ﬂux heating condition was simulated by the
present study.
The pressure drop and heat transfer tests were per-
formed separately. Air was used as the test ﬂuids in both
tests and the pressure drop tests were conducted at iso-
thermal conditions. To measure the pressure drop across
the scale-roughened narrow channel, two tubes were
equipped with pressure taps of 0.5 mm diameter at the
two origins of coordinate systems as indicated in Fig.
1b. A short 1 mm diameter stainless steel tube was glued
on top of each pressure tapping as connection for ﬂexi-
ble tube. The pressure diﬀerence between two taps was
measured with a Rosemount digital type micromano-
meter. The precision of this micromanometer was

the successive protruding circular edge is encountered.
As the present scales are arranged in the staggered man-
ner, these protruding circular edges are conjoint to form
a network of step-by-step V-shaped edges pointing
downstream. The cross-plane secondary ﬂow cells could
accordingly be generated by two opposite scale-rough-
ened surfaces that improve the ﬂuid mixing. For down-
ward ﬂow condition, the coolant-stream ﬂows over the
scale-shaped cavities. The inclined surface behind each
scale-edge is in the uphill direction rather than the
downhill direction for forward ﬂow. The network of
step-by-step V-shaped edges, constructed by the edges
of scales, is pointing upstream when the ﬂow is directed
downward. Therefore, the subtle diﬀerences in ﬂow
structures between the forward and downward ﬂows in
the present scale-roughened channel exist. Referring to
the various rib-roughened and dimpled channels, the
discontinued circular edges over each scale-roughened
surface could similarly generate the spatial heat transfer

396variations. As the forward-ﬂow traverses the protruding
397edges rather than ﬂowing over the scale-edged cavities,
398the higher degree of zig-zag variation develops in the
399channel with forward ﬂow. Such zig-zag Nu variations
400are ampliﬁed by increasing Reynolds number but grad-
401ually faded in the further downstream.
402The complex ﬂow structures generated in the scale-
403roughened channel could yield the functional relation-
404ship between Nu and Re from Nu / Re0.8 [14]. The pres-
405ent heat transfer results at each axial station for all
406Reynolds numbers tested are well correlated by Re0.815
407and Re0.7 for forward and downward ﬂows respectively.
408As the streamwise distributions of local Nusselt number
409along the centerline of scale-roughened channel follow a
410simple exponential decay along the axis of channel to-
411wards the developed value, the experimental correla-
412tions, having the slight variation in Pr with maximum
413variation range of 1.68% been absorbed into the numer-
414ical coeﬃcients of equations, are derived as

with increasing Reynolds number as depicted in Fig. 4a.
The downward ﬂow in the present scale-roughened
channel consistently generates the higher friction factors
than the forward-ﬂow counterparts in the Re range of
1500 6 Re 6 15,000. In order to unravel the friction
augmentation from the smooth-walled tube levels due
to the present scale-roughened surface, the plot of f/f1
against Re for forward and downward ﬂows is shown
in Fig. 4b. Also compared in Fig. 4b are the f/f1 data
reported for the rib-roughened channels [1–6,8]. When
the Reynolds number gradually increases, the friction
ratios respectively decrease and increase for the scale-
roughened and rib-roughened channels [1–4,6] as shown
in Fig. 4a. The friction ratios in both scale-roughened
and rib-roughened channels tend to approach the
asymptotic values as the Reynolds number is further in-
creased from 10,000. It is noticed that the magnitudes of
friction augmentation in the present scale-roughened
channel are higher than those in the rib-roughened chan-
nels. The eﬀective heat transfer augmentation with

544Nu=Nu1 ratios in the range of 3–4.5 for the present
545scale-roughened channel is accompanying with the high
546pressure drop loss. From the application point of view,
547the pressure drop in the scale-roughened channel with
548forward ﬂow has to be compensated if the high heat-ﬂux
549transmissions with the levels about 4.5 times of Dittus–
550Boelter levels [14] are requested.
5513.3. Thermo-hydraulic performance
552Fig. 5 shows the comparison of thermal perfor-
553mances of present scale-roughened channel with rib-
554roughened channels [1–6]. The thermal performance in
555terms of ðNu=Nu1Þ=ðf =f1Þ1=3 is derived based on the
556same pumping power consumption [15]. As shown in
557Fig. 5, the decrease of thermal performance with increas-
558ing Reynolds number appears to be a common trend for
559rib-roughened channels with laminar and turbulent
560ﬂows. In this respect, the thermal performance improved
561by surface ribs is deteriorated for the applications
ned, dimpled and rib-roughened channels at various Reynolds

channels with the same width-to-height ratio of 8 [3].
Nevertheless, the thermal performances in scale-rough-
ened channel with downward ﬂows are the lowest ones
due to the high friction losses as seen in Fig. 5. Recalling
the heat transfer performances compared in Fig. 3 for
scale-roughened and rib-roughened channels, the pres-
ent scale-roughened channel with forward ﬂow could of-
fer the highest values of heat transfer augmentation with
the similar levels of thermal performance, which are suit-
able for applications with high Reynolds numbers.
4. Conclusions
This experimental study examined the heat transfer
and pressure drop in a scale-roughened narrow channel
with width-to-height ratio of 8. The streamwise heat
transfer data along with the friction factors of the
scale-roughened channel with forward and downward

604of 1500 6 Re 6 15,000 were acquired and the empirical
605correlations for Nu and f generated. Due to the subtle
606diﬀerences in the ﬂow structures between forward and
607downward ﬂows in the present scale-roughened channel,
608the Nusselt number ratios (Nu/Nu1) for laminar for-
609ward and downward ﬂows were in the range of 7.4–9.2
610and 6.2–7.4 respectively. The values of Nu/Nu1 for tur-
611bulent developed ﬂows in the scale-roughened narrow
612channel with forward and downward ﬂows were about
6134.5 and 3 respectively. The friction factors in the scale-
614roughened channel with forward ﬂows were consistently
615lower than those downward-ﬂow counterparts, which
616were considerable higher than the values in rib-rough-
617ened channels. The better thermal performances of
618scale-roughened channel with forward ﬂow relative to
619the comparative groups of rib-roughened channels could
620be developed at high Reynolds numbers of Re > 10,000.
621The present scale-roughened channel with forward ﬂow
622could oﬀer the highest levels of heat transfer augmenta-
623tion having similar values of thermal performance fac-
624tors with the comparative rib-roughened channels,
scaled-roughened and rib-roughened channels.
