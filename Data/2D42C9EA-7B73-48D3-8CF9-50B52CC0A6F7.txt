Abstract - The throughput of the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA 
radio network with MAP input traffic is analyzed by MAP/D/∞ 
queueing model. The previous DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio 
network with Poisson input traffic is a special case . 
 
Keywords- traffic modeling; code-division multiple access; 
queueing analysis 
 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
The earlier literatures on the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA 
radio network [1] assume the arrival process is Poisson. In this 
paper, we provide modeling and analysis of the above DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio network, but consider the 
general (non-Poisson) input traffic model. The packet 
generation is considered to follow a continuous-time Markovian 
arrival process (MAP) [2]. MAP can model “bursty”point 
process and then we can obtain algorithmically tractable matrix 
solution to a variety of problems in queueing models [3]. 
Therefore, we are motivated to analyze the throughput 
performance of the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio network 
using MAP/M/∞ queueing model when the input traffic model 
is a MAP to account for multimedia input traffic.  
In the numerical examples, we use MMPP to model the input 
traffic. The results show that the throughput performance is 
dependent on the MAP property which can represent different 
behavior over different time scales. The case in [1] (Poisson 
arrival process) is a special case of our proposed model 
(Markovian arrival process). 
 
 
II.  SYSTEM MODEL 
 
We consider a single-carrier DS CDMA system with 
processing gain N in an unslotted -ALOHA network with fixed 
packet length L(bits). The system consists of a single hub 
station and an infinite number of independent users. 
When there are k interfering packets in an asynchronous 
CDMA system with processing gain N, the bit error probability 
Pb(k),k 0≧ , is given by simplified improved Gaussian 
approximation [4].

In (1) and (4), bit errors in a packet are caused by the effect of 
Assume that in symbol interval ∆t, the level of interference  
k may increase to k+1, decrease to k-1, or remain to k in the 
same phase and the phase changes from phase j to other phases. 
Therefore we define the probability ),( tkPj  when the level 
of interference is k, K(t)=k, and the phase is j, J(t)= j, at time t. 
We have the state equation of the level of interference as 
follows

where the first and second term stand for the level of 
interference increase, decrease, respectively, the third term 
stands for the phase changes and the last term stands for neither 
the level of interference changes nor phase changes. 
Next, we comput steady-state packet success probability. Let 
pi=(pi0, pi1,…, pik,…) be the steady-state probability vector of the 
Markov process Q, i.e. 
 
1pie0pi0,piQ =≥=  and               (12) 
 
where kMkk ≤∀= 0),,,( ,0, pipi kpi . 
 
Since Q is stable, we have ),(lim, tkPjtjk ∞→=pi , for all 
k,j, and the vector pik corresponds to steady-state probability of 
states of the Markov process Q at the level of interference k. pik,j 
is the steady-state probability that k interfering packets arrive 
according to the arrival rate of the phase j . The level of 
interference K(t) may change over a packet duration, so  we set 
that the time period ∆t equals a bit duration and the number of 
interfering packets is constant over ∆t. This setting is the same 
as [1]. 
To calculate the packet success probability, we define the 
probability )),,(),,(( 11 jkjkPs as follows [1]:  
(i)   The probability )),,(),,(( 11 jkjkPs  is that the packet is 
transmitted successfully from the first bit to the )1( − th bit 
and the level of interference N(t) and the phase J(t) becomes k 
and j , respectively in the  -th bit. 
 
(ii)  k1 is the level of interference N(t) on the first bit in a 
packet. 
 
(iii)  j1 is the phase J(t) is on the first bit in a packet.We 
calculate the probability )),,(),,(( 11 jkjkPs  based on the 
two-dimensional Markov process {N(t), J(t), t≥ 0} as follows: 
Case  =1; the level of interfering N(t)=k1 and the phase 
J(t)=j1 are on first bit in a packet. Using the steady-state 
probability in (12), we can obtain 
 
11 ,1111
)1),,(),,(( jks jkjkP pi=          (13) 
 
Case 1> ; After ∆t , the level of interference N(t)=k and 
the phase J(t)=j are on  -th bit in a packet when the state 
transition occurs from adjacent state on (  -1)th bit in a packet.

According to the analysis in [7], in steady state the number of 
interfering packets in the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio 
network with fixed packet length is only related to the average 
packet length and not related to the probability distribution of 
the packet length. The packet length is assumed to have an 
exponential distributed with death rate µ, even if the packet 
length is fixed. That is, M/D/∞ queueing model is equal to the 
M/M/∞ in the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio network.  
For now, we assume MAP/D/∞ queueing model is equal to 
the MAP/M/∞ one for throughput analysis of the DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio network. We use the 
probability )),,(),,(( 11 jkjkPs to calculate the packet success 
probability Qs and set the  =L (bits) to calculate the packet 
success probability as follows:

Let G denote the number of arrival packets of the DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio network with fixed length in an 
packet duration Tp(sec) , i.e., Tp=L/R where R(bits/sec) is the 
data rate of the system. Then, the throughput performance of the 
DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio network S (packets/packet 
duration) is defined as the average number of transmission 
successful packet that the all bits of a packet is correct. We get

The throughput versus offered traffic for M/M/∞ queueing 
model [1] and MAP/M/∞ queueing model with various α and β 
is shown in Fig. 4. Due to (18) and (24), when α>β, the 
throughput of MAP input traffic case is lower than that of 
Poisson arrival process input traffic case, and vice versa.

VII. CONCLUSION 
 
We apply continuous-time the Markovian arrival process 
(MAP) to model the packet arrival process. We then use the 
MAP/M/∞ queuing model to analyze the throughput of the DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA radio networks. The results show that 
the its throughput depends on the states of the input traffic 
models.
