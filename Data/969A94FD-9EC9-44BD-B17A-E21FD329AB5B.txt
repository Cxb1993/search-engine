We investigated structural and characteristic changes in thin HfO2 films (<10 nm) by
varying their thicknesses and also examined their influence on the properties of
Pt/SrBi2Ta2O9/HfO2/Si metal/ferroelectric/insulator/semiconductor (MFIS) structures.
HfO2 films with different thicknesses were found to exhibit rather distinct
characteristics and to profoundly affect the properties of the fabricated MFIS capacitor.
We found that, when employing 3.2-nm-thick HfO2 as the buffer layer, the MFIS
capacitor showed good memory performance at low operation voltage. However, this
study demonstrated that some of the HfO2 limited its application in MFIS memory,
even though it is the most promising alternative gate dielectric material.
I. INTRODUCTION
Metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor field-effect transis-
tor (MFSFET)-type ferroelectric random access memo-
ries (FeRAMs) have received much attention because of
their many important features, such as their nonvolatility,
nondestructive read-out (NDRO), low power consump-
tion, and obeying of scaling-down rules.1,2 Nevertheless,
such MFS gate structures exhibit some serious problems
that affect their memory applications, such as poor inter-
face properties, high leakage currents, inadequate reten-
tion, and rapid fatigue. Consequently, metal/ferroelectric/
insulator/semiconductor (MFIS) structures—i.e., those
incorporating an insulating buffer layer (BL) composed
of SiO2, Si3N4, ZrO2, CeO2, or HfO2—have been pro-
posed to significantly improve upon these issues.3–8
Among these dielectrics, HfO2 is considered to be one of
the most promising buffer layer due to (i) a sufficiently
high- value so that it would not consume a significant
portion of the gate voltage, (ii) good thermal stability,
and (iii) good BL–Si interfacial properties.9–12
Materials such as high- dielectrics have been ob-
served to exhibit size effects when they approach nano-
scale thickness.13 Although several groups have used
HfO2 as a buffer layer for MFIS ferroelectric memo-
ries,8,14–18 few have reported on how HfO2 affected
memory properties in terms of film thickness. In this
present study, we focus on nano-thick (<10 nm) HfO2
buffer layers, and investigate their structural and charac-
teristic changes through varying thicknesses as well as
their influences on the properties of MFIS structures.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
HfO2 layers were deposited through atomic vapor
deposition (AVD) using a Tricent system (AIXTRON,
Aachen/Magdeburg, Germany) at a substrate tempera-
ture of 500 °C under an O2 ambient. The source material
for the AVD of HfO2 was hafnium diethylamide,
Hf[N(C2H5)2]4. Three kinds of HfO2 were prepared at
measured thicknesses of approximately 3.2, 6.6, and 8.6
nm, respectively, through transmission electron micros-
copy (TEM) analysis. A precleaned, HF-dipped P-type
(100) silicon wafer was used as the starting substrate. For
HfO2 densification, postdeposition annealing was per-
formed under N2 at 1000 °C for 30 s. SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT)

be distinguished; therefore, they are represented as tetragonal.

effects originated from the ferroelectric domain rever-
sion.24 Figure 6(b) presents the width of the memory
windows as a function of the applied voltage. The
memory window of sample A exhibited a near-linear
relationship with respect to the applied voltage in the
low-voltage region; it increased abruptly, however, from
2.9 to 4.9 V, when the applied voltage was increased
from 3 to 4 V, before reaching saturation. This surpris-
ingly high memory window (4.9 V) suggests that the
electric field on the SBT was sufficiently large to effi-
ciently switch the polarization of domains at such a low
operation voltage. By increasing buffer layer thickness,
the threshold voltage for memory window increased to
larger than 6 V [inset, Fig. 6(b)]. On the other hand,
annealing time also affected the switching properties of
MFIS structure. The 3-min annealed specimens showed
similar tendency in the aspect of memory window as
those crystallized for 1 min but with a much smaller
memory window when the applied voltage was lower
than 5 V. These results suggest that both the buffer layer
thickness and annealing conditions are critical to the
MFIS property, even if their effects on the microstructure
of SBT are hardly observed.
Because the interface characteristic plays an important
role in the performance of MFIS, we obtained a cross-
sectional high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 7)
of the SBT/HfO2/Si structures to examine the boundaries
existed between the SBT, the HfO2 layer, and the Si
substrate. As shown in Figs. 7(a)–7(c), all of the HfO2
layers showed polycrystalline structures with only one
grain across the entire films. In addition, an interfacial
layer (IL), about 3.5 nm thick, was formed between the
HfO2 and the Si substrate. Thickness variations of the
HfO2 and IL layers, respectively, in the specimens were
all identified through cross-sectional TEM analysis and
summarized in Fig. 8. The thickness of IL remained
nearly constant upon, before, or after postdeposition an-
nealing of the SBT. This finding suggests that the SBT
deposition and crystallization (750 °C, 1 min) processes
had only minor influences on the IL characteristics.
However, when the annealing time was prolonged
to 3 min, the properties of IL changed. As shown in

AS-3m.

The linear dependence of EOT reveals that the dielec-
tric constant for the HfO2 layer essentially remains con-
stant for the HfO2 thickness between about 3 and 9 nm.
This result suggests that the high volume fraction of
amorphous and non-monoclinic HfO2 for the very thin
films do little influence on their dielectric properties.
This dielectric constant  value (∼20.5) of the HfO2 layer
was in good agreement with values reported else-
where.28,29 Furthermore, the  value of ∼5.7 for the IL
layer implied that the IL was not simply a SiO2 but
possibly a silicate.30
On the basis of these results, the dielectric constant of
SBT (∼80–120) was calculated from the Pt/SBT/HfO2/
IL/Si structure. Therefore, we could obtain the individual
effective voltages of the SBT, HfO2, and IL, which are
governed by the following relationship31:
Vi =
Vg
Ci1Cferro + 1CHfO2 + 1CIL
, (2)
where Vi and Ci are the effective voltage and capacitance
of the ith layer, respectively, Vg is the voltage applied to
the MFIS structure, and Cferro, CHfO2, and CIL are the
capacitances of SBT, HfO2, and the IL, respectively. Us-
ing this equation, we roughly extracted the effective volt-
ages of each layer as a function of the dielectric constant
and the thickness. The estimated effective voltage ap-
plied to the SBT in AS-1m was as high as 0.76Vg; mean-
while, those across the HfO2 and IL were 0.05Vg and
0.19Vg, respectively. Therefore, the effective voltage
across the SBT was 3 V when a potential of 4 V was
applied; this value is two times greater than the coercive
voltage (Vc ≈ 1.5 V in the Pt/SBT/Pt structure). It is
reasonable that sample A would reach a saturated
memory window when Vg was larger than 4 V, as indi-
cated in Fig. 6(b). When the thickness of HfO2 increased
to 6.6 nm (BS-1m), the effective voltage applied to the
SBT decreased to 0.66Vg; however, the voltages across
the HfO2 and IL increased to 0.12Vg and 0.22Vg, respec-
tively. Although the effective voltage of SBT was lower
(relative to that of AS-1m), it was still larger (2.6 V,
under an applied potential of 4 V) than the coercive
voltage of SBT films. Based on these measurements, the
voltage as large as 4 V may have the potential to trigger
the ferroelectric domain reversion and display a wide
memory window. However, as shown in the inset of Fig.
6(b), the threshold voltage of memory window in BS-1m
increases to larger than 6 V. Although its memory win-
dow reaches a maximum value as large as 10 V, it de-
creases rapidly with further increases in the applied volt-
age, implying occurrence of charge injection.24 This
finding conflicts with the analytical results, and some
other factors must exist that affect the characteristics of
memory window in this MFIS structure.
Figure 10 displays the secondary-ion mass spectrom-
etry (SIMS) depth profiles of the SBT/HfO2/Si struc-
tures. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the 3.2-nm-thick HfO2
buffer layer seems to be able to inhibit the inner-diffusion
of SBT species during 750 °C, 1 min annealing. Further-
more, we clearly observed [Fig. 10(b)] that a thicker
HfO2 layer (6.6 nm) provides a more efficient barrier
property for SBT species. Nevertheless, both of the HfO2
layers—at two different thicknesses—could not suppress
the out-diffusion of Si into the SBT layer. The source of
Si can be related to the evolution of a local stress at the
interface, resulting in interface directed IL decomposi-
tion.32 The most interesting finding is that, although
HfO2 is thermally stable with Si25; unfortunately, SIMS
analysis indicates that some Hf atoms out-diffused into
SBT (as indicated by the circle). This phenomenon is
more serious when the HfO2 buffer layer is thicker [Fig.
10(b)]. The out-diffused Si or Hf may have reacted with
the SBT. Such a process not only can bring about a
rougher interface but also can create additional defects
and a non-ferroelectric phase within the SBT; as a result,
the switching property of SBT was deteriorated. Except
for the SBT, characteristics of the IL, as well as the HfO2
buffer layer, are considered to be important for obtaining
good memory properties in MFIS structures. It is worth
noting that the electric fields in the IL or HfO2 were
much greater than those in the SBT. The magnitude of
charge injection was enhanced by a high electric field,
and the memory properties degraded upon increasing the
degree of charge injection.24 Therefore, the inferior prop-
erties of BS-1m could be attributed to the significant
out-diffusion of species into SBT, the low effective volt-
ages of SBT, and the high effective voltages across
HfO2/IL.
Figure 10(c) presents the SIMS depth profiles of AS-
3m. When Fig. 10(c) is compared with 10(a), either the

windows and high memory ratios at low applied volt-
ages, which are potentially valuable for memory appli-
cations requiring low operating potentials and low power
consumption. This enhanced performance may have
arisen from the high quality of the HfO2 layer (high-
value and good interfacial characteristics on the Si sub-
strate), suitable thickness ratio of SBT/HfO2, and appro-
priate annealing condition. However, when they under-
went a 3-min annealing step, such a thin HfO2 layer
could not provide enough of a barrier for diffusion of the
O or SBT species due to its inferior constituted phases
and grain structures. Increasing the HfO2 thickness im-
proved its barrier property but was accompanied with a
reduction in the effective voltage and the more serious
out-diffusion of Hf. This present study indicated that a
desirable memory property could be achieved by adopt-
ing an adequate HfO2 thickness and annealing condition.
Nevertheless, the nature of HfO2 (unstable with SBT,
crystalline structure at moderate temperature) somewhat
restricts its application for MFIS memory.
