5- and 6-fold coordinate Ti atoms,17 as indicated by 2c-O, 3c-
O, 5c-Ti, and 6c-Ti, respectively. Usually, the 2c-O and 5c-Ti
atoms are more reactive than the 3c-O and 6c-Ti atoms due to
their unsaturated coordination.
The slab model is adopted in the present study to simulate
the interaction between the TiO2 solid phase and the HN3 gas
phase. This model takes into account the periodic condition
along the TiO2 surface. The vacuum space, which exists in the
direction perpendicular to the TiO2 surface, is assumed to
contain gas-phase molecules. Extending the model in the x-,
y-, and z-directions leads to the creation of an “infinite slab”.
Imposing the vacuum space 11.35 Å in the slab model prevents
the gas phase from interacting with the lower layer of the upper
slab and allows the TiO2 surface to relax so as to achieve the
required surface conditions. The smallest unit considered in
the calculations of the TiO2 anatase surface is known as the
“supercell.” In the current study, this supercell contains 6 TiO2
units, the dimensions of which are 5.458 Å × 7.57 Å × 22.7
Å, along three primitive vectors, a1, a2, and a3 as shown in
Figure 1. Note that the lowest layer of TiO2 supercells is fixed
during the calculations.
In this study, geometrical structures are optimized using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)18-21 and are
calculated on the basis of density functional theory. The gen-
eralized gradient approximation (GGA)22,23 used for the total
energy calculations is that of the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91)
formulation.22 The core pseudopotentials supplied with VASP
are used for the present calculations. The ten 3p, 3d, and 4s
electrons of each Ti atom and the six 2s and 2p electrons of
each O atom are explicitly considered. The spin-polarization
effects are also included in the calculations for the open-shell
systems. Regarding the periodic condition along the TiO2
surface, the valence electrons are expanded by a plane-wave
basis set. The plane wave expansion includes all plane waves
with kinetic energies smaller than the chosen cutoff energy, pK2/
(2m) < Ecut. This ensures convergence with respect to the basis
set.TheBrillouinzoneissampledwiththechosenMonkhrost-Pack

system.
Result and Discussion
A. Verifications. Verifications of the accuracy of the model
adopted herein have been carried out. The bulk properties and
adsorption reactions for the TiO2 anatase (101) surface are
computed to verify the calculation parameters. A model size of
1 × 2 × 3 TiO2 units along a1, a2, and a3, as shown in Figure
1, is adopted along the three primitive vector directions for
anatase bulk, with the Monkhorst-Pack k-point set at 4 × 3 ×
2 and the Ecut set as 600 eV. The lattice constants obtained for
the anatase crystal are a ) 3.821 Å and c ) 9.678 Å, which
correspond well to the X-ray diffraction results of a ) 3.784 Å
and c ) 9.515 Å.25 The lattice constant obtained from the bulk
calculation is applied to the surface models with an 11.35 Å
vacuum space. The adsorption energy of water on TiO2(101) is
predicted by DFT simulation to be 14.3 kcal/mol, which falls
in the experimental range of 11.5-16.1 kcal/mol26 and is in
good agreement with the literature values of 16.6 and 17.3
kcal/mol27,28
.
A DFT simulation was conducted to verify the geometries
of HN3, N3, HN, and N2 and the reaction energies required to
dissociate HN3 into NH and N2 or H and N3. These geometries
and reaction energies were then compared with those found in
the Wang et al. study.15 These previous experimental results

Configurations 4 and 5 in Table 2 are two end-to-end
adsorption configurations, which represent the two end atoms
of an HN3 molecule, H and N(3), bonded to the surface 2c-O
or 5c-Ti atoms at the same time. For configuration 4, the
adsorption energy is 9.4 kcal/mol and the bond lengths of
N(3)-Ti and H-O pairs are 2.430 and 1.730 Å, respectively.
Compared with the bond lengths of N(3)-Ti and H-O in end-
on configurations 1 and 2, the N(3)-Ti length is longer than
that of configuration 1; conversely, the O-H length in config-
uration 4 is shorter than that of configuration 2. This is because
the H-O bond in configuration 4 is stronger than that of
configuration 2 and the N(3)-Ti bond is weaker than that of
configuration 1. The adsorption energies of both configurations
(4 and 5) of this doubly bonded adsorbate in the end-to-end
configuration are larger than those of either end-on configuration
1 or end-on configuration 2. Configuration 5 also shows an end-
to-end adsorption configuration similar to that of configuration
4; however, the end H atom forms a hydrogen bond with another
distant 2c-O, where the distance between this 2c-O (the second
nearest neighbor) and 5c-Ti, where the end N(3) atom is
adsorbed, is 4.265 Å. This distance is farther than that in
configuration 4, where the distance between 2c-O (the first
nearest neighbor) and 5c-Ti is 3.867 Å. Thus, the bond lengths
of the H-O pair and the N(3)-Ti pair are longer than those in
configuration 4, which is also longer than those of end-on
configuration 1 or end-on configuration 2. This is because the
bond must span from a 5c-Ti atom to the second nearest
neighbor 2c-O atom in order to fit the HN3 molecule into the
orientation of configuration 5. Because the bond lengths of H-O
and N(3)-Ti pairs increase, the adsorption energy is lower than
that of configuration 4. Configuration 6 represents the end-to-
side Ti-N2N(H)-Ti(a) adsorption configuration, indicating that
one end atom N(3) and one side atom N(1) form two bonds
with the surface 5c-Ti atoms. For configuration 6, the bond
lengths of N(3)-Ti and N(1)-Ti are 2.620 and 3.203 Å,
respectively. Both of the bond lengths are longer than those of
the related bond lengths of the end-on Ti-N(3) of configurations
1 and the side-on Ti-N(1) configuration 3, respectively. The
adsorption energy is 7.0 kcal/mol, which lies between the ener-
gies of configuration 1 and configuration 3. Finally, for the
adsorption energy of all the HN3 possible adsorption configura-
tions, the side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a) is highest.
C. HN3 Fragment Adsorption with and without H Coad-
sorption on 2c-O. This study investigates two dissociation
processes of an HN3 molecule, decomposed into HN and N2
and H and N3, on the anatase (101) surface. Table 1 shows the
dissociation energies of HN3 dissociated into two compositions,
which have smaller energies than the other possible dissociation
process, HN3(g) f HN2(g) + N(g). The adsorption energies
for each single fragment of an HN3 molecule, that is, HN, N2,
H, and N3, are used to predict the most stable coadsorption sites
for the fragments of an HN3 molecule and the final most
preferable adsorbate after the dissociation process.
Another situation is considered where the fragment adsorption
configurations with H are coadsorbed on 2c-O of the TiO2
surface. The forming of the hydroxyl group also represents the
situation that the H2O dissociation on the surface defects of the
O vacancy.31-35 The adsorption energy, Eads, is obtained from
the following formula, which is similar to the above eq 1:
Eads )Emol +Esurface⁄H -Emol ⁄surface⁄H (2)
The different term Esurface/H, the second term of the right-
hand side of eq 2, represents the energy of the surface that H
has adsorbed on the 2c-O of the surface, and similarly, the third

term of Emol/surface/H is the total energy of the surface where H
is adsorbed on the 2c-O site and the molecule of the HN3
fragment is coadsorbed elsewhere on the surface. This formula
will show that fragments coadsorbed with H on a surface will
produce differing levels of energy compared with a clean
surface.36 In order to distinguish the adsorption energy calculated
from eq 1 from that calculated from eq 2, we put a superscript
“a” after the adsorbate expression, for example, N3-Ti(a)a, to
indicate that the adsorption energy is calculated from eq 2.
Finally, note that if there is no effect when the HN3 fragment
adsorbs on the anatase surface while H is coadsorbed on the
surface, the adsorption energies calculated by eq 1 and eq 2 are
the same.
The calculation results for the fragments of the HN3 molecule
are listed in Tables 3 and 4. In these two tables, δE represents
the energy difference in the adsorption energies for the same
fragment with different orientations. The highest adsorption
energy, which represents the most favorable binding site, is set

15a, and 15b are Bader atomic charges in unit e.

present in the coadsorption configuration show that the charge
change of N3 is significant for the change in both individual
atom charge and the total charge. Similar results can be obtained
for Ti-N3-Ti(a)a and Ti-N3-O(a)a for individual charge
changes for each N atom, which shows a significant change in
charge.
Observation of the bond lengths for Ti-N for N3-Ti(a)a,
Ti-N3-O(a)a and Ti-N3-Ti(a)a, which are listed in Table 4,
shows that they all become shorter than those related adsorbates
that are adsorbed on the clean surface. In addition, the distances
between the N atom of N3 and the H atom that absorbs on 2c-
O, N-HO2c become shorter than 3.0 Å, which leads to the
formation of a hydrogen bond between N and H. Among them,
the shortest bond length is 2.709 Å for Ti-N3-Ti(a)a. These
formations of the hydrogen bond also result in an increase in
the adsorption energy.
Finally, these results related to the Bader atomic charge and
changes in bond length in adsorption configurations are also
consistent with the fact that adsorption energies for N3-Ti(a)a,
Ti-N3-O(a)a and Ti-N3-Ti(a)a significantly increase due to
H coadsorption on the TiO2 surface, while the increase in
adsorption energy for O-(H)N-Ti(a)a and N2-Ti(a)a is
negligible.
E. Potential Energy Surface. The potential energy surface
(PES) is discussed in this section, as are the energies of the
previous stable configurations and the additional transition states
found between subsequent stable configurations. Transition state
(TS) searching employs the nudged elastic band (NEB)
method,37,38 which involves TS searching through a given 8-14
image files, which have been interpolated from one initial stable
configuration to another stable configuration. In the following
subsections, we first discuss the transformation among those
different HN3 adsorption configurations listed in Table 2 and
then discuss the HN3 dissociative adsorption based on the results
given in Tables 3 and 4.
E.1. HN3 Adsorption Configuration Transformation. Figure
4 presents the transformation pathways of different adsorption
configurations, as well as the possible dissociative pathways.
The transformation pathway, as shown with solid lines, starts
from an initial state of HN3(g) and an anatase (101) surface
that is set as an energy reference then is followed by a sequence
of the transformation of HN3 adsorption configurations. HN3(g)
at first forms an end-on HN3-Ti(a) (configuration 1) with an
energy of -5.7 kcal/mol. This end-on HN3-Ti(a) becomes an
end-to-end Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) (configuration 5), and an end-to-
side Ti-N2N(H)-Ti(a) (configuration 6) through the TS1 and
TS2, respectively. Figure 5 shows the transition configurations
for all the transition states, TS1-TS11. Because the transition
states TS1 and TS2 only involve the rotation of the HN3
molecule, the maximum energy barrier between configuration
1 and TS1-TS2 is found at TS1, where the difference is 1.5
kcal/mol. In addition to a pathway from end-on HN3-Ti(a)
(configuration 1) to end-to-end Ti-N3H-O(a) (configuration
4) without energy barrier, there is another pathway to end-to-
end Ti-N3H-O(a) (configuration 4), found from end-to-end
Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) (configuration 5) through TS3, with an energy
barrier of 0.8 kcal/mol. This value is similar to those of previous
transition states, TS1-TS2, because this transition involves only
HN3 molecular rotation.
From configuration 6 of an end-to-side Ti-N2N(H)-Ti(a),
there is one pathway to side-on HN(N2)-Ti, configuration 3.
The pathway is via TS4 with a higher energy barrier of 3.7
kcal/mol. From configuration 4 of end-to-end Ti-N3H-O, there
is also one pathway through TS5 with an energy barrier of 5.9
kcal/mol to the end-on N3H-O of configuration 2. These two
adsorption configuration transformations from 6 to 3 through
TS4 and from 4 to 2 through TS5 involve N-Ti bond breaking;
thus the energy barriers of TS4 and TS5 are slightly higher than
those of TS1-TS3.
E.2. HN3 DissociatiWe Adsorption. The HN3 dissociative
adsorption pathway is plotted as the broken lines in Figure 4.
These two dissociative adsorptions involve the gas phase of HN3
dissociating into HN(a) + N2(a) and H(a) + N3(a). For the first
possible dissociative adsorption of HN3(g) (i.e., HN(a) + N2(a)),
the possible initial configuration is side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a) of
configuration 3, end-on HN3-Ti(a) of configuration 1, and end-
to-side Ti-N2N(H)-Ti(a) of configuration 6 to dissociate into
the final adsorbate Ti-(H)N-O(a) + N2-Ti(a), constituted by
configurations 7b and 11. This final adsorbate also represents
the lowest energy level of the all possible dissociative adsorbates
of HN and N2 forming on the surface, which is predicted by
data presented in Table 3. Note that the lowest energy level
adsorbate for HN on the surface should be Ti-(H)N-O(a)a of
configuration 7a rather than Ti-(H)N-O(a) of configuration
7b. Here, H is absent for the HN3 gas-phase dissociative
reaction, that is, HN3(g) f HN(g) + N2(g); thus, the H
coadsorbed configuration was not considered here for this
dissociative reaction. The energy level of this adsorbate
Ti-(H)N-O(a) + N2-Ti(a) shown in Figure 4 is 5.7 kcal/mol,
where the energy level shown in parenthesis, that is, 2.7 kcal/
mol, is the amount adjusted to consider the polarization effect.
From side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a), configuration 3, to the above final
adsorbate, the dissociative energy barrier through TS8 is 17.5
kcal/mol. For the second end-on HN3-Ti(a), configuration 1,
to the final adsorbate, the dissociative pathway is via an energy
barrier of TS7 with 77.5 kcal/mol. This transition energy is quite
high and is almost equal to the dissociative energy of HN3(g)
f HN(g) + N2(g), as shown in Table 1. This also represents
the fact that the catalytic effect is not significant while
dissociation of HN3 gas phase occurs starting from configuration
1. Finally, for the last end-to-side Ti-N2N(H)-Ti(a), config-
uration 6, to the final adsorbate, the dissociative pathway is via
an energy barrier of TS6 with 15.7 kcal/mol.
Similarly, the second dissociative adsorption of HN3(g) (i.e.,
H(a) + N3(a)) is described with the data provided in Table 4,
which shows that the final adsorbates are H-O(a) of configu-
ration 12 and the end-on N3-Ti(a)a of configuration 14b; as
stated previously, the H present in the coadsorption configuration
needs to be considered. Thus, the energy level of the final
adsorbate of N3-Ti(a)a + H-O(a) is -12.8 kcal/mol, as shown
in Figure 4. The possible initial configuration leading to this
final adsorbate is end-to-end Ti-N3H-O(a) of configuration 4
or another end-to-end Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) of configuration 5. From
configuration 4 to the final adsorbate of N3-Ti(a)a + H-O(a),
the energy barrier is 2.6 kcal/mol via TS9. Note that the energy
level becomes 46.4 kcal/mol more than the present energy level
of -12.8 kcal/mol if the effect of H coadsorption is not
considered. As described previously, the significant change in
charge as well as the hydrogen bonding on the surface stabilized
the adsorption of N3-Ti(a). Similarly, end-to-end Ti-N3H · · ·
O*(a) of configuration 5 also reaches the same final adsorbate
of N3-Ti(a)a + H-O(a); it overcomes the same energy barrier
of 2.6 kcal/mol but via TS10. Finally, the last possible initial
configuration to the same final adsorbate of N3-Ti(a)a +
H-O(a) is side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a) of configuration 3. The energy
barrier via TS11 is 7.1 kcal/mol.
From the discussion above, the most likely of the two possible
pathways of the dissociative adsorption of HN3(g) on the TiO2
H J. Phys. Chem. C, Vol. xxx, No. xx, XXXX Chang et al.
addition, there is no end-to-side Ti-N2N(H)-O(a) with the
anatase (101) instead having the end-to-side Ti-N2N(H)-Ti
on its surface. For the HN3 fragment, there is a doubly bonded
adsorbate of Ti-(H)N-O(a) on the anatase (101) surface but
not on the rutile surface. This is due to the special geometric
features of the sawtooth-like anatase surface39 that produces a
Ti-O distance (∼1.8 Å) far shorter than that (∼3.6 Å) of the
rutile surface, thereby easily forming the doubly bonded
adsorbate.40 Finally, there are two additional doubly bonded
adsorbates of Ti-N3-O(a) and Ti-N3-Ti(a) found on the
anatase surface that are not found on the rutile surface. In
contrast, the adsorbate of N3-O(a) is not found on the anatase
surface, yet it appears on the rutile surface.
Comparison of the adsorption energies for all the similar HN3
adsorbates of end-on HN3-Ti(a) and side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a)
configurations shows that the absorption energy is similar for
both the anatase (101) and rutile (110) surfaces, but the
adsorption energies of these two adsorbates is slightly higher
for the anatase (101) surface than for those of the rutile (110)
surface. For the HN3 fragments, however, there exists a
significant difference in their adsorption energies. For example,
the adsorption energies of HN-Ti(a), N2-Ti(a), H-Ti(a), and
N3-Ti(a) on the (clean) anatase (101) surface are 8.6, 0.7, 6.6,
and 4.8 kcal/mol higher than those on the rutile (110) surface,
respectively. Conversely, the adsorption energies of HN-O(a)
and H-O(a) on the anatase (101) surface are 83.2 and 41.2
kcal/mol lower than those on the rutile (110) surface, respec-
tively. In addition, no N3-O(a) is found on the anatase surface,
but it is found on the rutile surface with an adsorption energy
of 19.0 kcal/mol. We can deduce from these results that the
5c-Ti atom is more active on the anatase (101) surface than on
the rutile (110) surface, while 2c-O is more active on the rutile
(110) surface than on the anatase (101) surface. This result of
2c-O on the rutile (110) surface being more active than that on
the anatase (101) surface was also observed in our previous
investigation35 of BClx adsorbed on both anatase and rutile
surfaces.
Finally, in a comparison of the PES of all configurations, it
is clear that the most probable dissociative product is N3-Ti(a)a
+ O-H(a) on the anatase surface, while it is HN-O(a) +
N2-Ti(a) on the rutile surface. The reaction pathways are also
similar for both surfaces when starting from the reactant of end-
to-end Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) and side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a), leading to
the final product of N3-Ti(a) + O-H(a). For these two reaction
pathways from Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) and side-on HN(H2)-Ti(a) to
N3-Ti(a) + H-O(a) on the anatase (101) and rutile (110)
surfaces, the energy barrier for Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) to N3-Ti(a)
+ H-O(a) pathway is 8.4 kcal/mol lower for the anatase (101)
surface than for the rutile (110) surface. The energy barrier from
the side-on HN(H2)-Ti(a) to N3-Ti(a) + H-O(a) is 6.1 kcal/
mol higher for the anatase (101) surface than for the rutile (110)
surface.
The other lower energy of the final product is configured as
Ti-(H)N-O(a) + N2-Ti(a) for the anatase (101) surface and
HN-O(a) + N2-Ti(a) for the rutile (110) surface. These two
products are actually quite similar except that HN absorbs on
the anatase (101) surface to form a doubly bonded structure
due to the sawtooth-like anatase surface, as previously men-
tioned. The reaction pathways are also similar for both surfaces
when the reaction starts from the reactant of end-to-side
Ti-N2N(H)-Ti(a) (Ti-N2N(H)-O(a) for the rutile (110)
surface), leading to the final product of Ti-(H)N-O(a) +
N2-Ti(a) (HN-O(a) + N2-Ti(a) for the rutile (110) surface).
The energy barrier on the anatase (101) surface is 15.7 kcal/
mol; however, no energy barrier is found on the rutile (110)
surface.
Finally, an overall comparison shows that the dissociative
adsorptions of HN3 are endothermic for Ti-(H)N-O(a) +
N2-Ti(a) and exothermic for N3-Ti(a)a + O-H(a) on the
anatase (101) surface, while both are exothermic on the rutile
(110) surface.
Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate the adsorption configurations
and the dissociative reactions of HN3 on the TiO2 anatase (101)
surface by first-principles calculations based on DFT with GGA
and the plane-wave method. The results show that there are six
different adsorption configurations of HN3 adsorbed on either
2c-O or 5c-Ti or both. Among those adsorption configurations
on the clean anatase (101) surface, the most stable adsorbate
configuration is side-on HN(N2)-Ti(a) with an adsorption
energy of 10.2 kcal/mol. In addition, for the HN3 fragments,
the most stable adsorbate is Ti-(H)N-O(a) with an adsorption
energy of 69.8 kcal/mol. The effect of the H present in the
coadsorbed configuration significantly increases the adsorption
energy by 46.4, 44.2, and 49.2 kcal/mol for the adsorbates of
N3-Ti(a), Ti-N3-O(a), and Ti-N3-Ti(a), respectively. The
energy barriers related to the different configuration transforma-
tions of HN3 adsorbate on an anatase (101) surface are below
6 kcal/mol because the transitions involve only HN3 molecular
rotation or single bond breaking. The lowest energy levels for
two dissociative adsorbates are Ti-(H)N-O(a) + N2-Ti(a) and
N3-Ti(a)a + H-O(a) with energies of 5.7 and -12.8 kcal/
mol, respectively. The two lowest energy barriers for N3-Ti(a)a
+ H-O(a) that transit from their initial end-to-end
Ti-N3H · · ·O*(a) and end-to-end Ti-N3H-O(a) are approxi-
mately 2.6 kcal/mol. The comparison made between HN3 on
both anatase and rutile surfaces shows that the 5c-Ti atom is
more active on the anatase (101) surface than on the rutile (110)
surface, while 2c-O is more active on the rutile (110) surface
than on the anatase (101) surface. The reactions of dissociative
adsorptions of HN3 are endothermic for Ti-(H)N-O(a) +
N2-Ti(a) and exothermic for N3-Ti(a)a + O-H(a) on the
anatase (101) surface, while are both exothermic on the rutile
(110) surface.
