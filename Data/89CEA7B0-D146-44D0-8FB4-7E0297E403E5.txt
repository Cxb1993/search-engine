Abstract: 
The purpose of designing the lexical semantic representation model E-HowNet is for natural language 
understanding. Extended-HowNet (short as E-HowNet) is a frame-based entity-relation model extended from 
HowNet (Dong and Dong 2006) to define lexical senses (concepts). The following features are major 
extensions: 
a. Word senses (concepts) are defined by not only primitives but also any well-defined concepts and 
conceptual relations. 
b. A uniform sense representation for content words, function words and phrases 
c. Semantic relations are explicitly expressed 
 Lexical Semantic Representation and Semantic Composition 
 
1. Introduction 
To achieve natural language understanding, computer systems should know the sense similarity of and the 
dissimilarity between two sentences or two words. To achieve the above goals, it requires the support of 
ontologies. Ontology provides the following functions. 
 Identifies synonymous concepts and measures similarity distance between two concepts (Lui et al. 
2002).  
 Knows the shared semantic features and feature differences between two concepts. 
 Provides unique index to each concept, such that associated knowledge can be coded and accessed. 
 Language independent sense encoding 
 Logical inferences through conceptual property inheritance system 
 Dynamic concept decomposition and composition mechanisms 
In E-HowNet all concepts are either primitive concepts or defined by simpler concepts in terms of an 
entity-relation model (Chen et al., 2004 and 2005; Chenet al. 2005; Huang et al. 2008). In the examples of this 
paper, a primitive concept will have an English equivalent beside it, e.g. {read|讀}, whereas simpler concepts 
will be defined by Chinese words only, e.g. {狗}.  
The concepts form a hierarchical structure by hyponymy relations. It is obvious that the associated 
property or knowledge regarding a particular concept can be directly accessed or encoded through its 
definition or indirectly inherited from its ancestors. Furthermore, the hierarchical taxonomy also indicates the 
semantic distance between two concepts. However, conventional taxonomies do not provide the exact 
semantic similarities and dissimilarities of two concepts. In E-HowNet, definitions of concepts show not only 
the semantic similarities of two concepts but also the semantic differences between them. For instances, 
“teacher” and “tutor” are both human and hence inherit the properties of {human|人}. They also participate in 
the event of {teach|教}, but the semantic difference is that “tutor” particularly denotes the location of teaching 
is in the family. 
There are about two thousand and six hundred primitives, forming a taxonomy comprised of two types of 
subtrees of entities and relations. The entities include events, objects, and attribute-values. A brief example of 
taxonomy is as shown below1: 
                                                 
1 For detailed information on E-HowNet taxonomy, please see http://ckip.iis.sinica.edu.tw/taxonomy/ 
 (2)岳父 def: {father({wife({human|人})})}. 
(3)東台灣 def:{east({Taiwan|台灣})} 
However, semantic roles also have the form rel(x) which signals an underspecified value to be filled to 
complete the expression. Below are some examples: 
(4) a. wavelength 波長  
def: length({phenomena|現象:cause={shiver|顫動}}) 
b. wavelength 10 km 波長十公里 
def: length({phenomena|現象:cause={shiver|顫動}})={10 公里} 
c. electric wave which has a wavelength of 10 km 波長十公里的電波 
def: {length({phenomena|現象:cause={shiver|顫動:agent={electricity|電}}})={10 公里}} 
In order to achieve automatic feature unification processes, we organized relations into a hierarchical 
structure similar to the taxonomy for entities.  
 
2. Principles for sense definition 
2.1 A concept is defined by its hypernym and prominent properties 
Meaning of a concept is supported by its associated concepts including its formal properties, constituents, 
purposes, agentives, and relations to other concepts etc. To define a concept, it is not possible to encode all its 
associated relations. The principle for defining a concept is to first identify its immediate hypernym and then 
encode its most important features which suffice to differentiate it from other concepts. In principle, the qualia 
structure is the major representation for nominal-type (object-type) concepts (Pustejovsky, 1995), whereas 
event frames are for event-type concepts (Fillmore, 1998). The qualia of an object are agentive, telic, 
constitutive and formal. Agentive expresses the factors involved in the origin or “bringing about” of the object. 
Telic expresses the purpose and function of the object. Constitutive denotes the relations between the object 
and its constituents, such as its materials, parts, and components. Formal expresses the properties to 
distinguish the object within a larger domain, such as its shape, magnitude, and color. Example (5) to (8) 
respectively shows the usage of agentive, purpose, constitutive and formal: 
(5) 早產兒 premature baby  
def: {嬰兒:agentive={labour|臨產:TimePoint={early|早}:PatientProduct={~}}} 
(6) 狗食 dog food  
def: {food|食品: telic={feed|餵:target={狗},patient={~}}} 
 is defined by simpler or synonymous concepts instead of semantic primitives only and all attribute relations 
are explicitly expressed. In E-HowNet „獅子狗 Beijing dog‟ is defined as def:{狗:source={Beijing|北京}}. 
With the concept „dog‟ as the head sense, it denotes the hypernym-hyponym relation between „dog‟ and 
„Beijing dog‟, so that the definition is an ontological network in itself.  
In order to achieve unambiguous and language-independent definitions, E-HowNet adopts WordNet 
synsets as an alternative vocabulary for conceptual indexing and representation. Take (9) for example: 
(9) exhibit as evidence 證物 
a. Original E-HowNet definition 
def:{ inanimate|無生物: 
    domain={police|警}, 
    telic= {prove|證明: 
       instrument={~}}}. 
b. Definition is in terms of WordNet word sense number 
def:{<substance_n_1>: 
domain={<police_n_1>}, 
telic= {<testify_v_2 + corroborate_v_1>: 
instrument={~}}}). 
In E-HowNet, we redefine each complex concept with its immediate hypernymous concept and major 
differentiation descriptions, instead of the conventional HowNet definition that uses sememes only. 
e.g. site of a factory 廠址 
def: {location({工廠})} 
def:{location({InstitutePlace|場所:domain={industrial|工},telic={produce|製造:location={~}}})} 
def2={location({[institute_n_1]: domain={[industrial_adj_1]},telic={[produce_v_2]:location={~}}})} 
 
2.3 Multi-level representations: High-level representations can be decomposed into primitive 
representations 
The set of HowNet sememes (semantic primitives) are adopted by E-HowNet for ground-level 
definitions. In E-HowNet, new concepts are defined by any well-defined concepts and a definition can be 
dynamically decomposed into lower-level representations until ground-level definition is reached, in which all 
features in the definitions are sememes. Multi-level representational framework makes sense definitions more 
precise and easy to understand while retaining the advantage of using semantic primitives to achieve 
canonical sense representation. 
The multilevel representation approach makes meaning representations not only more readable but also more 
 denotes an event as well as the senses of its event roles. A noun refers to objects while playing the roles of 
verb arguments or modifiers of nouns. Therefore, it is clear that all words contain two types of senses, relation 
sense and content sense. The sense spectrum for syntactic categories is as shown in Table 2. For a lexical 
knowledge representation system, it is necessary to encode both relational senses and content senses in a 
uniform framework. E-HowNet is an entity-relation model to achieve representations of content/function 
word senses and sentence/phrasal senses. Some E-HowNet representations of word senses are shown in 
Table1. 
Function words               Content words 
Relational senses --------------------------------------------------------- Content senses 
de, prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, ……………………, adjectives, verbs, nouns 
Table 1. The sense spectrum for syntactic categories 
 
3.  Semantic Composition and Decomposition 
Semantic composition and decomposition are achieved by feature unification. During the unification 
process, feature values of the same relation type are unified. In the semantic composition process, if two 
constituents are syntactically dependent, their E-HowNet representations will be unified by following the 
basic composition process below.  
3.1 Basic semantic composition process:  
If a constituent B is a dependency-daughter of the constituent A, i.e. B is a modifier or an argument of A, then 
unify the semantic representation of A and B by the following steps: 
Step 1: Disambiguate the senses of A and B. 
Step 2: Identify the semantic relation between A and B to derive relation(A)={B}. 
Step 3: Unify the semantic representation of A by inserting relation(A)={B} as a sub-feature of A. 
 
The methods for word sense disambiguation and relation identification are out of the scope of this manual. 
We will not discuss those issues here. In the following sentence, we will show how step 1 and 2 are done: 
Because it was raining, the clothes are all wet. 因為下雨，衣服都濕了。 
In the above sentence, „濕 wet‟, „衣服 clothes‟ and „下雨 rain‟ are content words, whereas „都 all‟, 
„了 le‟ and „因為 because‟ are function words. Their E-HowNet sense representations are shown in Table 3. 
The main difference in their representations is that the function words are represented by relations of the form 
rel(x)=(y), whereas the content words do not make references to the semantic roles they involve in the 
definition. When a content word is a dependency daughter of a head concept, the relation between the head 
 morphemes listed. By contrast, suffix attributes are productive enough to freely coin with prefix objects, acts 
and values, mostly to form attribute-type nominal compounds, e.g. “速” in 車速 „car speed‟ and “期” in 展
期 „exhibition-period.‟ 
Values are results of attributes. For example, the attribute “appearance” has values like {beatiful|美} and 
{ugly|醜}. In addition to adjectives, values can be measurements, like 三公尺 „3 meters,‟ and nouns, like 棉 
„cotton,‟ as a value of clothing material.  
 
With morphemes in the Affix database labeled based on E-HowNet, we present the major morphological 
rules and their meaning and POS prediction below, which are determined by the head of the compound.  
From Table 2 to Table 5 are morphological constructions of different of semantic types.

Table 4. Verb-Complement Construction 
Semantic types word POS Semantic relations of the two morphemes 
 between 牧 and 工, 核 and 工, etc. 
Chen & Chen (2000) proposed an example-based similarity measure to disambiguate the polysemous 
heads. They extracted some examples with the polysemous head morpheme from corpora and dictionaries, 
and classified them into different groups according to their meaning. Let‟s take “工” as example and add 
E-HowNet definitions for each class, shown as Table 6. 
The meaning of 牧工 “herdsman”, 核工 “nuclear industry” ,or 唱工 “art of singing” are then determined 
by comparing the similarity between their modifiers and the modifiers of each class of examples. That is, we 
compare 牧, 核 and 唱 respectively with 搬運, 女, 童, 化, 機, 刀...etc. And then find the most similar 
examples and choose their semantic type as the semantic type of the target words. For instance, 牧 is most 
similar to the modifiers in first class, thus the semantic type of 牧工 is “labor”. Similarity calculation helps 
to work out a preliminary definition for each unknown/undefined compound. To further define them, we need 
to know the relation between the modifiers and their head. Suppose that all examples in class two are shared 
with the same semantic feature “domain”, then we can further define 核工 by replacing the value of feature 
“domain” with the sense of “核” to create a new definition as (12): 
 
(12) 核工 “nuclear industry” 
def:{industry|工業:domain={nucleonics |核子學}} 
In similar way, 唱工 can be defined as (13): 
    (13) 唱工 “art of singing” 
   def:{skill|技術:predication={sing|唱:method={~}}}

Table 7: Results of VN feature. 
Another ambiguity is the category of DM words. Tai et al. (2008) use definitions in E-HowNet for 
disambiguating determinative-measure (DM) compounds and reach 89% accuracy in sense derivation and 
disambiguation. In consequence, classification on DMs should go beyond syntactic categories, which means 
different usage of measure words should be subdivided analogously. For example, usage of temporal related 
DMs, as ”日” is different from monetary DMs “元”, or length measurements DMs, as “公尺”. As a result, we 
try to adopt definitions in E-HowNet to classify DM words appropriately.  
For the purpose of disambiguating DM compounds, we increase hard restriction on grammar rules. There 
are seven subtypes of DM, explained and illustrated in Table :

 We believe that parser will be improved as these features inducted. 
 
4.3  Semantic role assignment 
The problem of semantic role assignment is a hot research topic. In E-HowNet, ample conceptual relations 
are encoded in the lexical sense representation, providing a knowledge base for identifying semantic relations 
between two concepts. In addition, all event frames including argument roles are provided at event hierarchy 
of E-HowNet. 
Some semantic relations are indirect and hard to identify. For instance, the relations between <fast 快> 
and <food 餐> between <fast 快> and <car 車> are different and cannot simply be described as 
property-entity relation. The semantic gaps regarding <serving fast > and <moving fast> respect to two 
compounds are not expressed explicitly. The different telic feature values for <food 餐> and <car 車> may 
provide some clues to resolve the problem. We will elaborate the problem more in the next section. 
 
4.4 Filling semantic gaps by automatic deduction 
In real implementations of semantic composition, we have found filling semantic gaps an important task, 
because some semantic elements are frequently omitted from surface sentences. To that end, we have encoded 
event frames and construction patterns to the respective verbs and keywords in the E-HowNet system. We 
have not only established object-attribute relations, but also revealed the participant roles in an event. For 
instance, „color‟ is a semantic role that denotes the relation between an object x and its color range y, as 
expressed by color(x)={y}. In the following sentences (14)-(16), we demonstrate how to restore sense 
omissions by object-attribute relations. 
(14) I like the red (something) 我喜歡紅的 
def:{FondOf|喜歡: 
experiencer={speaker|說話者}, 
target={object|物體: 
color={red|紅}}}. 
Because the semantic role „color‟ is an attribute of objects, it implies an object was missing in the 
sentence (14) and thus it is known that the target of „like‟ has to be recovered from context. Similarly, 
Quantitative Determinative is a semantic role that establishes the relation between an object and its quantity. A 
representation like that in (15) thus signifies the presence of an object. For the same reason as exemplified in 
(14), we know the object is omitted in (16) too. The event frame of {speak|說} has been coded as to take 
{human|人} as an agent role. We therefore know the absent object has to be an instance of {human|人}.  
(15) few 少數 
 Manner Manner Adjunct (Manner) 
Place Location Adjunct (Location) 
Time Time Adjunct (Time) 
Table 7. Mapping table for the fine-grained semantic roles 
(19) My height is one head taller than his height.我的身高比他的身高高一個頭 
def:{tall|高: 
Profiled_Item={speaker|說話者}, 
Profiled_Attribute={height|身高}, 
Standard_Item={他}, 
Standard_Attribute={height|身高}, 
Degree={head|頭:quantity={1}}}. 
 
5.  Conclusions and Future Research 
HowNet proposed a new model to represent lexical knowledge, inspiring us to expand this framework to 
achieve the task of mechanical natural language understanding. E-HowNet confines each concept to a 
semantic type and defines the relation between these types. Hence we have a consistent approach to 
representing concepts so that the computer can process and relate meanings.  
Semantic composition is a crucial component of language understanding. We have proposed a uniform 
representation system for both function words and content words to achieve semantic composition. We also 
suggested compositional functions to extend the expression of new concepts and make word and phrase 
definitions more detailed and accurate. Since sense omission increases the potential for wrong readings, we 
try to fill semantic gaps by automatic inference through the framework of E-HowNet. 
There are still many obstacles to achieving the goal of automatically extracting knowledge from 
language. Apart from sense disambiguation, discord between syntactic structures and their associated 
semantic representations is another critical problem. We need to determine rules which map from coarse 
syntactic structures to fine-grained semantic relations. Gap filling processes, as discussed, need to be an 
integral part of the mechanism. Normalization of sense representation to achieve real canonical sense 
representation and fine-grained semantic representations are also indispensable. Our future research will 
continue to address these issues.
