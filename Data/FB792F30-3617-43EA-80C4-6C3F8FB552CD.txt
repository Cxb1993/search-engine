dynamic systems. Tsui [11] investigated the response 
model analysis under an additive model and a linear 
response-to-signal relationship. Wasserman [12] 
illustrated the parameter design of dynamic system 
with the regression perspective. However, there have 
been few studies concerned with optimizing 
parameter design for the digital-digital dynamic 
problem. This paper gives a general model to 
optimize such a problem, and presents two examples 
to demonstrate the computation of standardized SN 
ratio and the optimization of the problem. 
 
2. DIGITAL-DIGITAL DYNAMIC 
SYSTEM 
 
In digital-digital dynamic systems, both signal 
(input) and response (output) are classified into two 
classes: 0 and 1. The digital-digital system is widely 
applied in the fields of telecommunication, computer 
operations and chemistry. For example, the chemical 
processes of metal refinement, element extraction 
and element separation can be viewed as a 
digital-digital dynamic system that has two kinds of 
error. 
Suppose 0n  input signals of 0 and 1n  input 
signals of 1 are tested. The number of accurate 
counting for input signals 0 and 1 are 00n  and 11n  
respectively, and the number of errors for input 
signals 0 and 1 are 01n  and 10n  respectively. 
Hence, the number of responses for output signals 0 
and 1 are 0r  ( 0 00 10r n n= + ) and 1r  ( 1 01 11r n n= + ) 
respectively. As a result, an input/output table can be 
developed, as shown in Table 1. 
In the digital-digital dynamic system, the ideal 
function is that whenever an input signal is 0, the 
output should be 0, and whenever the input signal is 
1, the output should be 1. Thus, the signal values for 
testing are x0=0 and x1=1. 
Suppose the output is a continuous random 
variable affected by control factors Z and noise 
factors N, the criterion for judging the output is the 
threshold value R. If output y0 is smaller than 
threshold R, y0 is set as 0 when input signal x0 is 0. 
Similarly, if output y1 is larger than threshold R, y1 is 
set as 1 when input signal x1 is 1. Figure 1 describes 
the model of digital-digital dynamic system. 
We develop the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for 
the model of digital-digital dynamic system. Let 
ijky  represent the kth observation under input signal 
i and output j. Similarly, let ...y  represent the grand 
total of all the observations and ...y  represent the 
grand average of all the observations. Hence, the 
total sum of squares ( TSS ) is given by

Suppose that under certain settings of control 
factors and noise conditions, the error rate p 
(= 01 0n n ) is the probability of wrongly classifying 
signal 0 as 1, and q (= 10 1n n ) is the probability of 
wrongly classifying signal 1 as 0. Let ( )|f y x  
represent the function of output y given input signal 
x=0 or x=1. The data in Table 1 can be converted into 
those in Table 2 and the input/output relationship of 
error rates p, q and threshold value R is shown 
graphically in Figure 2 (Phadke [8]).

Therefore, the quality loss ( 1L ) of processing one 
accurate output for input signal as 0 is given by 
1 1 1
pL K
p
= ⋅ −  (14) 
where 1K  is the cost of processing one accurate 
output for input signal as 0. 
Similarly, the quality loss ( 2L ) of processing one 
accurate output for input signal as 1 is represented by 
2 2 1
qL K
q
= ⋅ −  (15) 
where 2K  is the cost of processing one accurate 
output for input signal as 1. 
Hence, the total quality loss ( L ) can be expressed 
as

When 1K  is equal to 2K , we ignore the loss 
coefficients and rewrite the objective function, L, to 
be minimized as (1 ) (1 )p p q q− + − . 
The relationships between 0p , p and q depend on 
the distributions of output 0y  and 1y . Suppose 
that 0p  can be accomplished by adjusting the 
threshold value R to 'R  for minimizing the total 
quality loss. That is,

Therefore, the total quality loss after equalization

determine 'p  according to the observed error rates 
p and q, the following equality holds.

Equations (19) and (11), as suggested by Taguchi, 
are the same. However, equation (11) is derived by 
the same loss coefficient value for the two errors. In 
some situations, the loss coefficient K1 differs from 
K2. For example, the iron molecules going into the 
slag and the impurities going into the iron are 
unequal in a particular chemical separation process. 
When 1K  is not equal to 2K , we can adjust the

and the following equality holds.

The standardized SN ratio, 0η , can be obtained 
by equation (9). 
From the above analysis, we propose an approach 
to the digital-digital dynamic systems, as described 
in the following: 
Step 1. Evaluate the loss coefficients K1 and K2 for 
the two error rates p and q . 
Step 2. Compute the data of standardized 
input/output. 
Step 3. Compute error rates 'p  and 'q  after 
adjustment by equations (21) and (22). 
Step 4. Substitute 'p  and 'q  into equation (23) to 
obtain the signal factor contribution Bρ  and 
then compute standardized SN ratio, 0η , by 
equation (9). 
Step 5. Construct the main effects of factor levels 
table and graph according to the SN ratio and 
then determine those factors that have a 
strong effect on the quality characteristic of 
interest. 
 
5. ELEMENT EXTRACTION 
PROCESS 
 
The first case described by Taguchi [10] is the 
element extraction process, where an element X 
needed to be extracted from a solution using a 
diaphragm. Two types of diaphragms, A1 and A2, 
were tested to measure their extraction rate and the 
obtained data were shown in Table 5.

From Table 9, A2 diaphragm is better than A1 
diaphragm by 6.8246-4.0757=2.7489 (dB). 
Therefore, the input/output table of A2 diaphragms 
after optimization is shown in Table 10. 
Therefore, the total quality loss, L, per 1000 kg 
raw material in this case becomes: 
L=￥30×9.720+￥100×2.916=￥583.2 
The input/output table after optimization using the 
Taguchi method is shown in Table 11 and then we 
can find that the total quality loss is ￥627.4, which 
is large than that of proposed method.

found a variety of different engineering systems and 
technologies had common evolution, avoiding many 
fruitless trail and errors. In the last two decades, many 
users of well-known improvement methods like the TOC, 
Six Sigma, QFD, Taguchi method, DFMA, have 
recommended TRIZ as a valuable complement for 
innovation to these methods, no matter in technology, 
management, business strategy, and creativity [2]. 
Therefore, TRIZ have been verified to be a feasible 
innovative theory in solving many contradictions in 
engineering and technology [3]. However, TRIZ-based 
innovative approaches implemented in management area 
are still not popular or lack of discussion. 
The objective of this paper is to give fast TRIZ 
implementation on proposing alternative solutions for 
dealing with real management conflicts. The solutions 
are directly and easily guided by TRIZ contradiction 
matrix and 40 innovative principles. Managers in 
business could decide faster and achieve more 
satisfactory outcome, but avoid undesired worsen result. 
The proposed solution using TRIZ may be existed, 
innovative, or unexpected, are all feasible to resolve 
present and urgent management conflicts.  
 
2 Brief reviewing for TRIZ 
 As aforementioned, TRIZ is the theory that provides 
the basis to resolve problems or contradictions 
successfully. It includes contradiction analysis, using idle 
resources, increasing the ideality of final result, 
prediction for the evolution of both problems and 
solutions, and aiding with 40 innovative principles [2]. 
However, 40 innovative principles will be shortcuts to 
ideal final result without the analysis of contradictions 
and resource. They can be used as independent tools to 
obtain innovative or creative ideas for resolving conflicts. 
40 innovative principles were boiled by Altshuller in the 
early 1970s. In most situations, one principle will give a 
concept for initial solution, but several may be needed to 
achieve a practical working solution. The 40 innovative 
principles are listed as follows: 
1-2 Segmentation and Separation 
3-6 local quality, symmetry change, merge, and 
Multi-functionality 
7-8 Nested doll and weight compensation 
9-11 Preliminary counteraction, Preliminary action, and 
beforehand compensation 
12-14 Equi-potentiality, the other way around, and 
Curvature increase 
15-18 Dynamic parts, Partial or excessive actions, 
Dimensionality change, and Mechanical vibration  
19-21 Periodic action, continuity of useful action and 
hurrying 
22-24 Blessing in disguise, feedback and intermediary 
25-28Self-service, copying, cheap disposables and 
mechanical interaction substitution 
29-31 Pneumatics &hydraulics, flexible shells & thin 
films, and porous materials 
32-34 Optical property changes, homogeneity, and 
discarding &recovering 
35-37 Parameter change, Phase transition, and Thermal 
expansion 
38-40 Strong Oxidants. Inert atmosphere and composite 
materials  
 
A technical contradiction (tradeoff) means when one 
feature gets better, another feature will get worse. 
Altshuller had proposed 39 engineering features table 
and corresponding 39×39 contradiction matrix table. 
Cues for finding principles for negating tradeoffs are 
summarized in the 39×39 contradiction matrix table. D. 
Mann etc. [4] have adjusted 39 engineering features to 48 
ones to meet the requirement of advanced technology. 
The contradiction matrix table is therefore turn into a 
48×48 matrix. The revised 48 engineering features are 
listed in Table 1.

manufacturing and it will take days for sorting and

As far as due day is concerned, the most nearest and 
improved feature is loss of time (26). The worsen feature 
should be avoided is the amount of non-defective 
finished goods, which is nearest productivity (44). After 
checking 48×48 contradiction matrix, the suggested

Proposing suggestion by referring principle 13: Sorting 
the defective final products by non-defective final

time. However, the time is short up to due day. In stead 
of sorting, this NB manufacturer could consider deliver 
this high defective batch directly without sorting activity. 
This NB manufacturer will be notified once this batch is 
rejected by incoming inspection at customer site, sorting 
activity will be performed at that time. This approach is 
not encouraged since it temporarily solve urgent problem

Abstract: Robust design is an important method to reduce variation and improve the performance of products or processes. This method has 
been gaining wide attention, and its applications have been extended to making reliable decisions when designing complex engineering 
systems. The quality loss function proposed by Taguchi establishes a financial measure of the user dissatisfaction with a product’s 
performance as it deviates from an ideal target value. The product’s response is a curvilinear function rather than a single point in some 
practical situations. The optimization involves determining the best control factor levels so that the measured responses are closest to the 
desired targets. In this paper we present a method to optimize the multiple nonlinear responses based on the quality loss function. The 
example of a temperature control circuit design is provided to demonstrate the implementation and usefulness of the proposed method. 
Keywords: robust design; quality loss function; nonlinear response. 
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
There are several methods to reduce the effect of noise 
factors and unit-to-unit variation in order to improve the 
performance of products or processes. Among these 
methods, the robust design proposed by Taguchi (1991) is a 
particularly cost-effective approach for helping 
manufacturers to design their products or processes, leading 
to higher customer satisfaction and operational performance. 
The robust design problem is classified as a static problem if 
the desired output of the system has a fixed target and as a 
dynamic problem if the desired output of the system is a 
function of a signal factor setting. The response we observe 
for improving quality is called quality characteristic. 
Recently, several approaches to multiple static problems 
have been proposed in the literature (see Chiao and Hamada 
2001, Derringer and Suich 1980, Elsayed and Chen 1993, 
Khuri and Conlon 1981, Logothetis and Haigh 1988, 
Maghsoodloo and Chang 2001, Pignatiello 1993, Tsui 
1999(b), Vining 1998). Several researchers have studied the 
robust design of dynamic problems (see Hsieh et al. 2005, 
Lesperance and Park 2003, Lunani et al. 1997, McCaskey 
and Tsui 1997, Miller 2002, Miller and Wu 1996, Nair et al. 
2002, Tong et al. 2004, Tsui 1999(a), Wasserman 1996). 
However, few studies have been concerned with optimizing 
the robust design for a nonlinear response (such as 
frequency response function). 
In this paper, an optimal approach for correlated multiple 
nonlinear responses based on quality loss function is 
proposed. 
2 ROBUST DESIGN OF MULTIPLE NONLINEAR 
RESPONSES 
 
In the temperature control circuit, there are five control 
factors (R1, R2, R3, R5, and R12) and each control factor has 3 
alternate levels listed in Table 1. Assign them to No.4-No.8 
columns of the L18 inner orthogonal array. 
Table 1 Control factors and their levels 
Factors Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
A. Resistance R1 (kΩ) 1.95 3.9 7.8 
B. Resistance R2 (kΩ) 3.75 7.5 15.0 
C. Resistance R3 (kΩ) 0.5 1.0 2.0 
D. Resistance R5 (kΩ) 180 360.0 720 
E. Resistance R12 (kΩ) 1.65 3.3 6.6 
 
There are seven noise factors (R1, R2, R3, R5, R12, EZ, and 
E0) and each noise factor has 3 alternate levels listed in 
Table 2. The three levels of noise factors R1, R2, R3, R5 and 
R12 are -10%, 0, +10%, assuming that low quality elements 
are used. Three levels of E0 are 9.6, 10.1, and 10.6 (V), and 
those of EZ are 5.0, 5.3, and 5.6 (V). Assign them to No.2-
No.8 columns of the L18 outer orthogonal array. 
For every experimental combination of control factors, 
the RT-ON and RT-OFF under noise factor conditions can be 
calculated. Thus, there are 18 testing conditions for the 
computation of the average quality loss for RT-ON and RT-OFF, 
respectively. The simulated data of RT-ON and RT-OFF under 
control and noise factors conditions are shown in Table 3 
and Table 4, respectively. 
The ideal target values of RT-ON and RT-OFF those are 
affected by the levels of control factors are listed in Table 5 
and Table 6, respectively. 
Suppose the loss coefficients of RT-ON and RT-OFF are 
K1=3 and K2=2, respectively, and the correlated loss 
coefficient between RT-ON and RT-OFF is K12=0.15. Total 
average quality loss is obtained by equation (2) for each 
experimental combination. The data are tabulated in Table 7 
and the main effects of factors based on quality loss are 
listed in Table 8 and these effects are shown graphically in 
Figure 3.
