Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are synthesized from solid-stated polymers, polycarbosilane (PCS) and 
polyethylene (PE), by using a chemical vapor deposition-fluidized bed reactor (CVD-FBR). Ni shots 
with MgO and Fe(NO3)3 act as the catalysts. The experimental result indicates that diameters of 
CNTs, using PCS as carbon source, are from 15 to 90 nm and several µm in length when reaction 
temperatures are at 850-950?. Using PE as carbon source, the diameter of CNTs is from 25 to 90 nm 
and the length can reach 1 µm since reaction temperatures are at 750-850?. Comparing these two 
different carbon sources, the CNTs synthesized from PE have better quality and a higher degree of 
graphitization.

Abstract 
    This study investigates the interfacial reactions between Sn-3.0 wt%Ag-0.5 wt%Cu 
(SAC) and Sn-0.7wt% Cu (SC) on In/Ni/Cu multilayer substrates using the solid-liquid 
inter-diffusion bonding technique. Samples were reflowed first at 160, 180 and 200 oC for 
various periods, and then aged at 100 oC for 100 to 500 h. The scalloped Cu6Sn5 phase was 
formed at the SAC/In/Ni/Cu and SC/In/Ni/Cu interfaces. When the reflowing temperatures 
were 160 and 180 oC, a ternary Ni-In-Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) was formed when 
the samples were further aged at 100 oC. This ternary Ni-In-Sn IMC could be the binary 
Ni3Sn4 phase with extensive Cu and In solubilities, or the ternary Sn-In-Ni compound with 
Cu solubility, or even a quaternary compound. As the reflow temperature was increased to 
200 oC, only one Cu6Sn5 phase was formed at the solder/substrate interface with the heat 
treatment at 100 oC for 500 h. Mechanical test results indicated that the formation of the 
Ni-In-Sn ternary IMC weakened the mechanical strength of the solder joints. Furthermore, 
the SLID (solid-liquid inter-diffusion) technique in this work effectively reduced the 
reflowing temperature.

INTRODUTION 
Sn-Pb alloys are the most commonly adopted solders in the electronics industry. 
However, Pb harms the environment and human health1-2. Hence, the European Union (EU) 
has passed regulations, such as the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
Directive) and the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive) to ban the sale of 
I. Preparation of Solder Balls and In/Ni/Cu Multilayer Substrate 
    The Sn-3.0 wt% Ag-0.5 wt% Cu (SAC) solder ball with a diameter of 760 µm was 
purchased commercially from Yeh-Chiang Technology Corp. in Taiwan. However, the 
Sn-0.7 wt% Cu solder ball was prepared by the author. Sn and Cu metals with high 99.9 
wt% purity, used in the Sn-0.7 wt% Cu (SC) alloy, were weighed. SC alloys were 
encapsulated in a quartz tube in a 1.0×10-5 Pa vacuum. Then, the samples were placed in a 
tube furnace at 400 oC for 2 h. After the heat treatment, the sample tubes were quenched in 
ice water and cut down to a mass of about 1.69 mg. The SC alloy was dipped first in the 
rosin mildly activated (RAM) flux (commercial model: Deltalux 523) and then placed in 
silicon oil at 250 oC. Therefore, the SC solder ball with a diameter of 760.0 µm was 
obtained. 
A Cu rod with a diameter of 6.35 mm was cut into a disk with a thickness of 1.00 mm. 
Then, the Ni layer with a thickness of 5.0 µm and In layer with a thickness of 14.0 µm were 
deposited on the Cu substrate by an electroplating method to complete the In/Ni/Cu 
multilayer structure. 
 
II. Preparation of Interfacial Reactions and Analysis 
   The SAC and SC solder balls were immersed in RAM flux and then placed on the 
In/Ni/Cu surface, as presented in Figure 1. The samples were initially reflowed at 160,180 
and 200 oC for 3, 4 and 5 min and then aged at 100 oC for 100 to 500 h. Following heat 
treatment, each sample was metallographically examined. Therefore, the cross-section of 
the solder/substrate interface was clearly observed. The morphology at the solder/substrate 
interface was examined by optical microscopy (OM) and field-emission-scanning electron 
microscope (FE-SEM). The intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formed at the interfacial were 
identified by energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS) and electron probe X-ray 
micro-analyzer (EPMA), which provided their composition. The IMC was identified based 
on the phase diagram and experimental data. 
 
III. Testing Mechanical Properties  
    SAC solder specimens were reflowed at 160 oC for 3, 4 and 5 min and aged at 100 oC 
for 100 to 500 h, before undergoing mechanical testing using a universal testing machine 
(Shimadzu AI-GS). The testing parameters were set according to the industry 
standard-JESD22-B117. 15 The shear rate of mechanical properties testing was 300.0 µm/s.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
gray scalloped-shaped phase region is formed adjacent to the homogeneous brighter phase 
layer in Figure 3.  Compositional analysis indicated that it is the Cu6Sn5 phase with Ni 
solubility.  In addition to these two phases, both AgIn2 and Ag2In phases were formed and 
mixed in the solder phase.  It has been observed that the size of the Ag2In phase became 
larger with aging. 
Figure 4 shows the BEI micrograph of the SAC solder reacting with the In/Ni/Cu 
multilayer at 200 oC for 3 min. Only a dark and scallop-shaped region was found at the 
interface. The EPMA analysis and the Sn-Cu phase diagram16 indicate that this region is the 
Cu6Sn5 phase of Sn-36.2Cu-17.9Ni-1.8In. Comparing the surface morphology of the 
SAC/In/Ni/Cu system reflowed at 200 oC with that at 160 or 180 oC, we found that the 
Cu6Sn5 phase did not spread over the interface at 200 oC but that the Ni layer remained 
residually on the Cu surface. Additionally, the Ag3Sn phase was found in the solder and its 
composition was Sn-74.0Ag from EPMA analysis. Figure 5 shows the microstructure of the 
Ag3Sn phase following etched with a solution (93.0 CH3OH + 2.0 HCl+ 5.0 HNO3, in vol.%) 
for a few minutes to remove the solder. The dendrite shape microstructure in Figure 5 is the 
typical solidification structure. 18 The similar result was found in Sn-Ag/Ni system.19 
A different surface morphology was observed between the SAC solder and the 
In/Ni/Cu multilayer when the SAC/In/Ni/Cu systems were reflowed at 200 oC and then 
aged at 100 oC for a long period. As described above, the Ni-In-Sn ternary IMC was formed 
since the SAC/In/Ni/Cu system was reflowed at 160 or 180 oC and then aged at 100 oC for 
a long period of heat treatment; the Cu6Sn5 phase still adhered to the Ni-In-Sn ternary IMC. 
However, only the Cu6Sn5 phase was formed at the interface and adhered to the Ni side, as 
shown in Figure 6, which presents the BEI micrograph of the SAC/In/Ni/Cu system 
reflowed at 200 oC for 4 min and then aging 100 oC for 400 h. The Ag2In phase still can be 
observed in Figure 6. Similar results were obtained when the SAC/In/Ni/Cu specimens 
were reflowed at 200 oC for 3 or 5min and then heat-treated at 100 oC. 
 
II. Interfacial Reactions in Sn-0.7 wt% Cu Solders with the In/Ni/Cu Multilayer 
Figure 7 shows the BEI micrograph of the SC/In/Ni/Cu specimen that was reflowed at 
160 oC for 3min. The spalling and dark color region of Sn-41.1 Cu-11.9Ni-5.8In was 
formed at the interface. It is the Cu6Sn5 phase. 16 This result is very similar to that obtained 
in the SAC/In/Ni/Cu systems which were reflowed at 160 oC for 3 to 5min. 
Figure 8 shows the BEI micrograph of the SC/In/Ni/Cu specimen that was reflowed at 
160 oC for 3min and then aged at 100 oC for 300 h. Similar to the SAC/In/Ni/Cu specimen, 
the dark region spreading over the solder and the bright plane layer close to the Ni side 
the Sn-In phase diagram. The solder/substrate interface remained in the liquid state; the 
Cu6Sn5 phase peeled off of the substrate. More and more Sn atoms diffused toward the Cu 
side, diluting the concentration of In. The Sn-In composition reached the InSn4 phase 
region. Finally, the InSn4 phase was formed between the Cu6Sn5 phase and the Ni side, as 
shown in Figure 12 (III)-(IV).  
When the reflowed sample underwent heat treatment, the Ni atoms diffused to the 
solder through the InSn4 phase. However, the Cu6Sn5 phase acted as the diffusion barrier to 
prevent the diffusion of Ni atoms toward the solder. The Ni-In-Sn ternary IMC was formed 
between the Cu6Sn5 phase and the Ni side. However, a question as to why the Ni-In-Sn 
ternary IMC is not formed when the reflowing temperature is at 200 oC still remains. As in 
the solder/In/Ni/Cu sample that was reflowed at 160 or 180 oC, the In layer became liquid 
and the Cu6Sn5 phase formed at the interface. The In content decreased and shifted toward 
the Sn-rich region. At 200 oC, compared to 160 or 180 oC, the stable phase more easily 
reaches the Sn-rich region and that is the β-Sn phase. Thus, only the Cu6Sn5 phase can be 
found at the solder/Ni interface. 
 
IV. Mechanical Properties Testing and SLID Technique 
    Figure 13 plots the tensile strength of the SAC/In/Ni/Cu system first reflowed at 160 
oC for 3 to 5min and then aged at 100 oC for 100 to 500 h. As presented in Figure 13, the 
tensile strength clearly decreased as the heat treatment continued for over 100 h. The drop 
in the strength may have been caused by the formation of IMCs at the interface. IMCs are 
hard and brittle. Thus, the formation of IMCs with excessive thickness reduces the 
solder-joint strength. 13 In this study, the Ni-In-Sn ternary IMC is observed at the interface 
after 100 h of heat treatment. Therefore, the formation of the Ni-In-Sn ternary IMC 
weakened the mechanical strength of the solder joints. 
    Another important aim of this study is to reduce the reflowing temperature applied to 
connect the SCA or SC solder with the Cu pad in the BGA or FC process. The In and Ni 
layers were deposited on the Cu surface by the electroplating method. Then, SAC or SC 
solders were reflowed below 200 oC to connect the In/Ni/Cu multi-layer substrate. This 
reflowing temperature was 70 oC lower than the typical reflowing temperature of about 270 
oC. According to these results, the surface forms an effective connection between the solder 
and substrate, and the solder-joint strength is also good enough after a long period of heat 
treatment. The connection method used in this work is similar to the solid-liquid 
inter-diffusion (SLID) technique. In the reflowing process, the In layer becomes liquid and
