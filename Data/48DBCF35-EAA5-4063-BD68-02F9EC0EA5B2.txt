I. Abstract 
 
A new parallel distributed fuzzy sliding 
mode controller for nonlinear systems with 
mismatched uncertainties is presented in this 
paper.  Nonlinear systems are approximated 
by T-S fuzzy models.  The uncertainties are 
assumed to satisfy a sliding coefficient 
matching condition.  With the sliding 
coefficient matching condition satisfied, a 
parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode 
controller PDFSC is designed. The stability 
and sliding mode of the fuzzy sliding control 
system are guaranteed. Also, the nonlinear 
system is shown to be invariant on the sliding 
surface.  Moreover, the chattering is 
reduced by the proposed design approach.

II.  Introduction 
 
The fuzzy modeling approaches have become 
popular and have been successfully applied 
to approximate many nonlinear systems [1].  
Recently, the T-S fuzzy model has played a 
significant role in nonlinear system modeling 
[2]. For a nonlinear system modelled with a 
T-S fuzzy model, the most important design 
issue for a controller is to have the system 
stability guaranteed and the system 
performance indexes satisfied.  In the past 
several decades, the variable structure with 
sliding mode has been applied to control the 
systems with uncertainties because of the 
intrinsic nature of robustness of the variable 
structure with sliding mode [3].  Also, the 
sliding mode system can be invariant to the 
uncertainties in many cases [4].  Moreover, 
the fuzzy techniques [5] together with the 
sliding mode control have been applied to the 
systems with uncertainties.  It can be seen 
that fuzzy sliding mode control can alleviate 
the chattering. In this paper, a new parallel 
distributed fuzzy sliding mode controller 
(PDFSC) is designed for the control of the 
nonlinear systems with mismatched time 
varying uncertainties.  The nonlinear system 
is approximated by a T-S fuzzy model. The 
time varying uncertainties are assumed to 
satisfy a sliding coefficient matching 
condition. The stability and the sliding mode 
of the fuzzy sliding control system are 
guaranteed. Also, the chattering around the 
sliding surface in the sliding mode control is 
reduced by the proposed design approach.  
Simulation results are included to illustrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed controller 
PDFSC.

The stability and invariance properties of the 
uncertain nonlinear system UNTSF with the 
parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode 
controller PDFSC is discussed in this section.  
In Theorem 2, the invariant characteristic of 
the uncertain nonlinear system UNTSF with 
the sliding coefficient matching condition 
satisfied is described. 
 
Theorem 2 
An uncertain nonlinear system UNTSF (see 
Section II) which satisfy the sliding 
coefficient matching condition is invariant 
with respect to time varying uncertainties on 
the sliding surface.                   J 
It is known that if the reaching mode of the 
fuzzy sliding control system is guaranteed 
and the fuzzy sliding mode control system is 
stable on the sliding surface, then the fuzzy 
sliding mode control system is stable. In 
order to have the fuzzy sliding control 
system be stable on the sliding surface, the 
eigenvalues of the matrix

need to be all negative.  This condition can 
be satisfied with the proper selection of the 
sliding coefficient matrix C. The illustrative 
examples are included in the next section to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive 
fuzzy sliding controllers designed here.  
 
VI. Simulation results 
 
For simulation, a system with complex 
uncertainties is implemented. In this example, 
the differential equation for the nonlinear 
plant is defined to be

Let the fuzzy plant rules of the nonlinear 
system in Eq. 4 be represented by

To satisfy the sliding coefficient matching 
condition, the sliding surface is designed to 
be  S=Cx=[2  1]x. Then the proposed 
parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode 
controller is designed to have the output $u$ 
(as in Theorem 1) with k1=0,k2=5.  The 
stable performance of the uncertain nonlinear 
system UNTSF with the proposed controller 
PDFSC is shown in Figure 1 (the initial 
condition is x=[-1.2 -1.2]). Also, Figure 2 
provides the control action u without 
chattering. 
 
VII. Conclusions 
 
A parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode 
controller is proposed for the nonlinear 
systems with mismatched time varying 
uncertainties in this paper.  The nonlinear 
system is approximated by the T-S fuzzy 
linear model.  The approximation error 
between the nonlinear system and the T-S 
fuzzy linear model is included as one part of 
the uncertainties. The sliding mode controller 
is designed to have the sliding coefficient 
matching condition satisfied.  The sliding 
mode of the uncertain system with the 
proposed fuzzy sliding mode controller 
PDFSC is guaranteed. The system is shown 
to be invariant and stable on the sliding 
surface. Also, the chattering around the 
sliding surface for the parallel distributed 
fuzzy sliding mode control is reduced.  
Simulation results are included to illustrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy 
sliding mode controller.
