Introduction 
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials, routinely used as catalyst, 
ion-exchanger and adsorbent. Zeolite can also be grown on substrate to form a film or 
coating. In the earlier days of zeolite synthesis researches, it is often found that a layer 
of zeolite is formed on the TEFLON lining after hydrothermal reaction. It was 
considered as an undesirable byproduct, and its removal was necessary for reusing the 
reactor. By the early 90th, several groups [3-6]have succeeded in preparing continuous 
coating on dense support. Among them, the zeolite coating made by Jansen et al. [7] 
has preferential orientation, and has been cited most frequently. From then on, various 
ways have been attempted, and sometime patented, for making oriented coating of 
different zeolite on various substrats [8-33].  
The potential applications for zeolite coating range from molecular selective sensor or 
electrode, catalyst film to electro-optical components. It has also been demonstrated 
to be effective as low k dielectric film [32], corrosion resistant coating [31] and 
antimicrobial coating[34] for metals. The most interesting among them is the 
electro-optical application. For example, zeolite having selected guest molecules 
inside the pore may exhibit nonlinear optical behavior. Trapping semiconductor 
clusters inside the zeolitic cages may also produce a true quantum dot system that is 
of critical importance to solid-state devices. These are just a special case in the family 
include [25] where one first prepare a dispersion of discrete microcrystals of zeolite 
with nagative surface charge. The charged microcrystals are then attached to a 
substrate with opposite surface charge to form a monolayer. The coated substrate is 
thern calcined in steam to fix the monolayer. The use of zeolite as low k dielectric 
film [32] for semiconductor industry as well as corrosion resistant coating [31] for 
metals has also been patented. 
We [41;42] have been working on the synthesis of colloidal MFI zeolite and zeolite 
membrane for a number of years. Recently[43;44], we found that the addition of 
surfactant to a clear precursor solution was very effective in reducing the size of the 
colloidal nanocrystals zeolite obtained. We [45] further developed a steamer where the 
humidity can be controlled, and by doing so, we were able to control the aggregation 
of zeolite nanocrystals produced. This lead to a new approach where we can coat the 
precursor on to substrate and steam the coated substrate afterward to convert the 
precursor to zeolite. Presently, we have been able to coat a strongly bonded layer of 
MFI zeolite on glass, silicon wafer and PES (polyether sulfone) substrates. The 
coatings obtained were transparent and showed a preferred orientation, as 
demonstrated by the UV/Vis measurement and AFM picture given below. 
Furthermore, by varying the precursor preparation or the heating conditions,

of Cundy et al. [2] with a recipe of 1 SiO2: 0.36 TPAOH: 
19.2 H2O: 4 EtOH. The clear sol was aged at 22oC for 
several days then subjected to a microwave heating at 
175oC for ~2hrs. (B) Our data. The aging was done at 
80oC and hydrothermal at 175oC for 1.5 hrs. 
Our results are consistent with the previously proposed nucleation mechanism of 
silicalite-1 from a clear synthesis solution [46]. Primary TPA/SiO2 units about 3~5 nm 
were present very early in the system. Upon heating, secondary aggregates started to 
appear, that eventually became 
zeolite nanocrystals via a 
restructuring and densification 
(zeolization) process. If primary 
units remain in the system, further 
growth of the nanocrystal via the 
addition of the silica, either directly 
in the form of primary units or 
through the dissolution products of these primary units, would be possible. By 
increasing the concentration of the synthesis sol, we were able to accelerate the 
formation of aggregates. The generation and growth of more aggregates quickly 
consumed most of the primary units in the system and set a limit to the size it can 
grow. Therefore, although the aggregates generated were initially larger than that 
observed previously in more diluted system; the ultimate crystal size was slightly less. 
The overall effect was the reduction of the synthesis time for silicalite nanocrystals by 
more than a factor of ten. The result of the above study has been published in [47] 
increased the spinning rate, the zeolite layer became thinner and the interference 
pattern shift to lower wavelength. The maximum transmittance increased from 92% of 
the original substrate to ~95.5% at the constructive interference maximum. From 
these interference patterns, an effective refractive index of 1.26 could be estimated. 
This is lower than that of zeolite due to the interparticle voids in the nanocrystalline 
film.

Figure 3 Reflectance of flexible substrate 
after hybrid hard coat and zeolite AR coating.
A zeolite AR layer was applied on a 300 mm wide transparent PET web, pretreated 
with hybrid hard coat, by a continuous die 
coater at 3m/min and 140oC curing. The 
reflection of visible light was measured with 
Perkin Elmer L900 and demonstrated in Figure 
2. Under proper conditions, a reflection less 
than 4% can be achieved.  
A single layer of transparent zeolite layer functioned well as AR coating for different 
substrates. This simple approach will find large market for the display industry. 
Taiwan patent as well as US patent have been submitted on this technology and we 
are in the process of negotiating a technology transfer.
