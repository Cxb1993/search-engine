11. Introduction 
Many state-of-the-art weather and air quality models, such as MM5 (Grell et al., 
1995), WRF (Dudhia et al., 2005), AERMOD (USEPA, 2004) and CAMx (ENVIRON, 
2006), require land characteristics such as aerodynamic roughness, albedo, Bowen 
Ratio, friction velocity and surface moisture availability for the calculations of mixing 
length, stability class, dry deposition, and surface energy components. In the past, 
these characteristics have been difficult to measure. They are usually derived from the 
measurements of wind speed, temperature and humidity at many levels within the 
atmospheric surface layer (ASL) (e.g., Brutsaert and Kustas 1987; Sugita and 
Brutsaert 1990; Munley and Hipps 1991; Brutsaert and Parlange 1992; Swiatek 1992; 
Parlange and Brutsaert 1993; Sugita et al. 1997). This method is called the profile 
method. Recently, due to the advance of the eddy covariance (EC) technique, they can 
now be measured continuously at a single level, at a much lower price. 
Moreover, the use of EC flux towers to monitor these fluxes and trace gases 
between the land surface and the atmosphere has proliferated, such as Euroflux 
(Valentini et al., 2000), AmeriFlux (Baldocchi et al., 2001), through global networks 
such as Fluxnet (Baldocchi et al.,2001) and many others (e.g. Parlange and Katul, 
1995; Feigenwinter et al., 1999; Martano, 2000). Nonetheless, it is found that the 
surface energy budget is not balanced at many flux tower sites (Aubinet et al., 2000; 
Baldocchi et al., 2001; Wilson et al., 2002a; 2002b; Heusinkveld et al., 2004; Meyers 
and Hollinger, 2004; Oliphant et al., 2004). It is suspected that the turbulent heat 
fluxes measured by an EC system might have systematic errors. Both methods have 
often been applied to study the turbulence characteristics within the ASL, however it 
is not well known how the characteristics derived by the two methods depart from 
each other. According to these reasons, this study tries to conduct such an evaluation. 
However, many of the reference tables describing the characteristics of 
agricultural land covers in these models were derived from sites in western countries 
where may not be entirely in accordance with the conditions found elsewhere. In 
South and East Asia, rice is the major food staple and the major crop. For example, in 
Taiwan, 75% of plain terrain (elevation < 200 m above sea level) or 21% of land grids 
are utilized for rice paddies (CTCI, 2003). Rice is very different from other crops, 
being grown under flooded conditions. More than 80 % of freshwater resource 
development projects in Asia are used for irrigation and about half of the total 
irrigation water is used for rice production (Bhuiyan, 1992). The water-fed rice paddy 
field may modify the surface energy budget, water cycle, runoff and ground water 
storage of the region (Wu et al., 2001). For accurately quantifying the water usage of a

2.1 Profile and single-level method 
2.1.1 Profile Method 
The main assumption of the profile method is that the similarity theory (Businger 
et al., 1971) is valid within the ASL under the conditions of homogeneity and steady 
state. Aerodynamic roughness z0m, zero-displacement height d0, friction velocity u*, 
surface sensible heat flux H, surface latent heat flux LE and Monin–Obukhov (M-O) 
length L can all be determined using the method developed by Tsuang et al. (2003), 
with the assumptions of steady state and horizontal homogeneity (Businger et al., 
1971) using profile data observed under unstable atmosphere. The method can be 
applied to study sites, where the profiles of wind speed, potential temperature and 
specific humidity within the ASL, along with the net radiation and ground heat flux 
are measured. For each profile, the height range of the ASL, the aerodynamic 
roughness and other values are calculated using a six-step process (Tsai and Tsuang, 
2005). 
The Bowen Ratio (Bp) using the profile data can be determined (Grimmond and 
Oke, 1991) as: 
 ( )( )zq

L

p

∂∂= θ  (1) 
where cp is specific heat capacity of air; Lv is the latent heat of vaporization; z∂∂θ  
and zq ∂∂  are the gradients of potential temperature and specific humidity fitting 
the profile data within the ASL, respectively. 
2.1.2 Single-level method 
An EC system is able to measure friction velocity (u*), surface sensible heat flux 
(H) and surface latent heat flux (LE) directly. These data plus some single-level 
meteorological data can be used to determine surface roughness length for momentum 
(z0m) and Bowen Ratio (B) as the followings. 
The single-level data measured by an EC system can be used for determining z0m 
according to Martano (2000), by solving a one-variable minimum problem with 
single-level measurements of wind speed and fluxes. The Monin-Obukhov similarity 
theory (Businger et al., 1971) shows that the wind speed profile u(z) can be written as:

2.3 Field experiments and instruments 
The study site is located at the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) 
(120°41’E, 24°01’N, 50 m above sea level) in the Taichung Basin in central Taiwan 
(Figure 1). 
The field experiment was carried out on a rice paddy with an area of 0.45 km in 
the N-S direction × 0.2 km in the E-W direction, from 5 April to 29 May 2005. During 
the experimental period the canopy height increased about from 26.1 cm to 73.7 cm. 
The depth of the water layer during the flooded period ranged from 2 to 6 cm. The 
9between the soil heat flux plate sensors and the surface was measured using TCAV 
which consisted of four thermocouple junctions divided into two groups and buried at 
a depths of 3 cm and 6 cm respectively. The distance between the two groups in the 
same level was 1 m. The mean values of TCAV served as the mean soil temperature 
(Tg) between the instruments and the surface.

by setting d0 at the paddy height (e.g. Gao et al., 2003) and by neglecting ( )Lz mm 0Ψ  
in the S term (Garratt, 1992). The qualified EC data are grouped according to wind 
direction into 15° intervals. Data in each wind direction interval are used to determine 
d0 and z0m according to Eq. (5). The results are shown in Figure 2. 
3.1.2 ASL, Roughness length for momentum (z0m) and zero-plane displacement 
height (d0) 
In the NWD, the mean height range was 7 m – 25 m. Note that the lower limit of 
the ASL in the NWD can be lower than 7 m since we launched the tethersonde 
balloon from 5 m agl. We do not have data to examine the vertical structure below 5 
m agl. In the SWD, the mean height range of the ASL was 14 m – 42 m. The height 
range in the NWD was lower than in the SWD, likely due to the roughness elements 
in the NWD being lower than those in the SWD (Figure 1). The upper limit of the 
ASL in the SWD was close to those observed in a few nearby sites in the same basin 
(Tsai and Tsuang, 2005), and lower than in other locations (Brutsaert and Sugita, 1990; 
Parlange and Brutsaert, 1990; Brutsaert and Parlange, 1992; Parlange and Katul, 1995; 
Asanuma et al., 2000). 
Using the tethersonde profile data we find that, in the NWD, the values of z0m 
ranged from 0.01 m to 0.07 m, with the mean at 0.03 m and the standard deviation at 
0.02 m. The corresponding values of d0 were in the range from 0.8 m to 1.3 m. In the 
SWD, the values of z0m varied from 0.2 m to 0.4 m, with the mean at 0.4 m and the 
standard deviation at 0.2 m. The corresponding values of d0 were in the range from 3 
m to 8 m. Using the EC data we find that in the NWD the values of z0m were in the 
range from 0.01 m to 0.04 m, with the mean at 0.02 m and the standard deviation at 
0.01 m. The corresponding d0 were in the range from 0.7 m to 1.1 m. In the SWD, the 
values of z0m varied from 0.04 m to 0.13 m, with the mean at 0.08 m and standard 
deviation at 0.03 m. The corresponding d0 was in the range from 1 m to 2 m. 
Nonetheless, unrealistic d0 with heights < 0 m were found for winds coming from 
120° - 135° and 135° - 150°. Note that the lower limit of the ASL height in the SWD 
can be higher than the height of the EC measurement, at 5 m agl (Figure 2). Therefore, 
the data observed at the height of the EC system may not within the ASL; hence, the 
similarity theory may fail. Kustas et al. (2005) also found that for the use of the 
single-level method, unrealistic values of d0 might be determined. 
3.1.3 Bewen Ratio and friction velocity 
The time series of the Bowen Ratios observed by the tethersonde system (Bp) and 
the EC system (Be) from 22 to 29 April 2005 are shown in Figure 3. During the 
13
the Q*7.1 with the bias at -25 W m-2, the RMSE at 46 W m-2 and the correlation 
coefficient at 0.99 (Figure 7). This implies that the net radiation measured by the SIRS 
at the study site can be underestimated by 25 W m-2. 
The rice paddy during the experiment was filled with water ranging from 2 - 6 
cm deep. The wet soil storage is determined according to Eq. (11). The paddy water 
heat storage is determined according to Eq. (12). During the day, the ground heat flux, 
the soil heat storage and the paddy water storage consisted of 9%, 14% and 6% of 
available heat flux, respectively (Table 1). 
The sensible heat flux derived from the perturbation of temperature observed by 
FW05 is close to that of virtual temperature observed by CSAT3 with the bias at -1 W 
m-2, the RMSE at 6 W m-2 and the correlation coefficient at 0.95 (Figure 8). This 
implies that the fluctuations of temperature measured by CSAT3 can be compared 
with those measured by a thermocouple. 
Table 2 and Figure 9 show the Energy Balance Ratios (EBRs) and the regression 
coefficients from the ordinary least squared (OLS) relationship between the sums of 
the turbulence heat fluxes (LE + H), against the available heat flux (V) of various 
corrections. It can be seen that both the EBRs and the regression coefficients of the 
OLS relationship become closer to 1 after each correction. The corrections include 1) 
coordinate rotation correction (e.q. Wilczak et al., 2001), 2) Webb correction (Webb et 
al. (1980), 3) canopy heat storage correction, 4) advected heat flux correction, and 5) 
photosynthetic energy correction. 
3.2.2 Canopy heat storage (C), advected heat flux (A) and photosynthetic heat 
flux (F) corrections 
The canopy heat storage term is the rate of energy storage per unit area between 
the surface and the height (hc= 5 m) where the sensible and latent heat fluxes were 
measured by the EC system. The canopy heat storage is determined according to Eq. 
(13). During the day, the canopy heat storage term consisted of 0.6% of available heat 
flux (Table 1).The EBR increased by 0.01 after the incorporation of the term during 
the daytime. In addition, the slope of OLS relationship increased by 0.009 after the 
correction (Table 2). Local advection heat flux was estimated using Eq. (14), which is 
the simplified, steady state, two dimensional, mean thermodynamic equation. The 
upwind numerical scheme is used for the calculation of advected heat flux (e.g., 
Griebel et al., 1998). The horizontal temperature (specific humidity) gradients are 
determined using the temperatures (specific humidities) interpolated at locations 1 km 
north, south, east and west from the study site. During the day, the local advected heat 
flux consisted of 0.1% of available heat flux (Table 1). The EBR increased by 0.001 
15
the atmosphere is stable, causing a higher aerodynamic resistance, and the stomata are 
closed, causing a higher canopy resistance. At noon, the atmosphere is the most 
unstable, causing a lower aerodynamic resistance, and the stomata are fully opened, 
causing a lower canopy resistance. The daytime range of canopy resistance was 
between 42 s m-1 around noon and 152 s m-1 at 4 PM. These values are closer to 
those for rice paddies in Yoshimoto et al. (2005), ranging from 50 - 200 s m-1, and 
close to those in Harazono et al. (1998), ranging from 78 - 100 s m-1. 
Surface moisture availability is used in weather models (MM5 and WRF) for 
determining the actual evapotranspiration rate from the potential evapotranspiration 
rate. It can be calculated according to Eq. (25) from the derived aerodynamic 
resistance and the canopy resistance. The results show that the surface moisture 
availability of the rice paddy was almost constant, varying from 0.46 to 0.74 (Figure 
14). No significant diurnal pattern was observed. The mean surface moisture 
availability was 0.56, which is close to the value of 0.5 as prescribed in MM5 and 
WRF (Table 3).
