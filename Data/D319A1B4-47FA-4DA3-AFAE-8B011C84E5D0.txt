Abstract 
 The present study is aimed at investigating theoretically the instability of the thin 
liquid film attached to the inside wall of a micro-pipette through which there exists a 
steady vapor or gaseous flow. Such an instability, usually called “interfacial instability”, 
is mainly due to the interfacial deformation and surface tension effect accompanied with 
the liquid-vapor flow, slip boundary condition at the liquid-vapor interface, liquid film 
thickness, etc. 
 The linear stability analysis is employed to accomplish the task. The main 
procedures of analysis are described briefly as follows: (1) Obtain the basic solutions 
for the liquid-vapor flow analytically. (2) Derive the disturbance equations and the 
related boundary conditions for small disturbances. (3) Obtain the dimensionless 
parameters by introducing appropriate non-dimensionalization scheme. (4) With the aid 
of normal mode analysis, the disturbance equations is reduced to an eigenvalue problem. 
(5) Solve the long-wave instability analytically. (6) Obtain the onset conditions for the 
interfacial instability of the thin liquid film with numerical computations and discuss the 
physical mechanism. 
 The results indicate that the interfacial deformation, basic liquid-vapor flows, slip 
boundary condition, and liquid film thickness really affect the interfacial instability of 
the thin liquid film. In the long-wave instabilities, although the liquid-vapor flow and 
the interfacial slip boundary condition do not change the onset wavenumber, they make 
the instability shift from the stationary mode to the oscillatory mode. The numerical 
computation not only demonstrates such a phenomenon but also finds that, in general 
situations, the basic liquid-vapor flow, or Reynolds number effect, will increase the 
range of the onset wavenumber of instability. However, the maximum growth rate of 
instability decreases due to the inertia effect. In addition, it is also found that the

Introduction 
1-1 Two-Phase Flows 
 Two-phase flows are flows containing two phases of materials with an interface 
separating them. Two-phase flows can be sorted as gas-liquid flows, gas-solid flows, 
liquid-solid flows, and immiscible liquid-liquid flows. They are involved in numerous 
industrial processes and occur in various natural phenomena. 
 Gas-liquid flows are very common in industrial applications such as heat pipes, 
distillation columns, air-conditioning, etc, mainly for the purpose of heat exchange. 
They are highly associated with cavitations of propellers of pumps, airplanes, and boats 
as well. Gas-liquid flows are popularly involved in pneumatic-transporting -liquid 
systems, such as liquid fuel combustion, coolant injection in mechanical manufacture, 
and in hydraulic-transporting-vapor systems, such as aquiculture and oil-drilling 
applications. Gas-liquid flows can also be seen in natural phenomena such as 
groundwater flows, waves in the sea, evolution of clouds, etc. 
 In industrial processes, gas-solid flows involved in pneumatic conveying particles 
are commonly used in food, coal, and mineral powder processing. Gas-solid flows in 
solid fuel combustion are encountered in pulverized coal combustion, solid waste 
incineration, and rocket propellant combustion. Fine powder-gas flows are closely 
associated with material processing such as plasma coating, xerography, and chemical 
vapor deposition for silicon production. The natural phenomena along with gas-solid 
flows are exemplified by sand storms, moving sand dunes, and cosmic dusts. 
 Liquid-solid flows associated with hydraulic conveying particles are used in blood 
transport, sample sorting, and food processing. Liquid-solid flows applied in chemical

the ordinary flow system, such as the surface tension, the van der Waals force 
(composed of orientation, induction, and dispersion force), and the steric force (if the 
chain of molecules is long enough), should be reconsidered in the micro-channel flows. 
 In addition, since the characteristic length in the micro-channel flow is about the 
order of the magnitude of the mean free path of gases at a reduced pressure condition, 
the validity of the no-slip boundary condition and, even, the Navier-Stokes equations 
becomes questionable. In the following, the appropriate governing equations and 
boundary conditions for the micro-channel flows will be discussed briefly. 
Depending on the rarefaction of the flow, the characteristics of a gaseous flow 
would change drastically. The degree of rarefaction of a gaseous flow is generally 
characterized by Knudsen number Kn , which is a dimensionless parameter first 
proposed by Knudsen in 1909. The definition of Knudsen number is the ratio of the 
mean free path of the molecules   λ to the characteristic length of the flow field  L , i.e., 
Kn
L
λ= .        ……(1-1) 
 According to Arkilic [1], four flow regimes were defined generally by the range of 
Knudsen number: 
1. When 0.01 Kn < , the flow field is in the continuum flow regime with no-slip 
 boundary conditions being applied. 
2. When 0.01 0.1 Kn< < , the flow field is still in the continuum flow regime; 
 however, the slip boundary conditions have to be applied to provide a finite 
 velocity and temperature jump at the boundary. 
3. When 0.1 3 Kn< < , the flow field is in the transition flow regime. To describe  the 
flow phenomenon adequately, the kinetic theory of gases must be applied. 
4. When 3 Kn< , the flow field is in the free molecular flow regime. 
 However, with numerical simulations and experimental studies, Koplik [2] verified 
  5
 The Chapman-Enskog expansion is an asymptotic expansion in terms of the 
nondimensionalized mean free path of the molecules around the equilibrium state of the 
flow field by the characteristic length of the flow field. Thus, the Chapman-Enskog 
expansion is an asymptotic expansion based on Knudsen number. In the zeroth-order 
expansion, i.e., ( )0 O Kn , the molecules of the flow obey the Maxwell distribution and 
both the shear stresses and heat flux vanish. In the first-order expansion, i.e., ( ) O Kn , 
the shear stress is directly proportional to the velocity gradient and the heat flux is 
directly proportional to the temperature gradient. While in the second-order expansion, 
the shear stresses and heat flux are a certain function of the velocity gradient and the 
temperature gradient, respectively. 
 Substituting the expressions of the zeroth-order Chapman-Enskog expansion into 
the conservation equations of momentum, the Euler equations, which neglect the effect 
of viscosity, are derived and possess an accuracy of ( )0O Kn . With the substitution of 
the shear stresses in the first-order Chapman-Enskog expansion into the conservation 
equations of momentum, the Navier-Stokes equations with an accuracy of ( )O Kn  
then obtained. Similarly, in terms of the expressions of the shear stresses in the 
second-order Chapman-Enskog expansion, the Burnett equations with an accuracy of 
( )2O Kn  are derived.  
 Therefore, when Knudsen number is small, both the Navier-Stokes and Burnett 
equations are adequate approximations to the Boltzmann equation. As the Knudsen 
number increases, since the higher order terms can not be neglected, both equations 
become less adequate consequently. It has also been proved by Bird that, in addition to 
its complexity, the Burnett equations will violet the second law of thermodynamics 
under certain conditions due to its ill-defined boundary conditions. Thus, it is the 
  7
velocity of the solid boundary. He also introduced a coefficient f  to indicate the 
percentage of the diffuse reflection. 
 
 
   Fig. 1–3  The velocity of the gas layer adjacent to the wall. 
 
 Kennard consider a thin layer  ς adjacent to the solid boundary, as shown in Fig. 
1-3, with thickness being much smaller than the mean free path of the particles. In this 
thin layer  ς , he assumed that half of the particles remain the same velocity as the 
particles one   λ away from the boundary, i.e., the free-stream velocity f Vv , while half of 
the particles being diffusively reflected from the solid boundary with percentage f . 
Those particles being diffusively reflected have the same velocity as of the solid 
boundary wall V
v
. Thus, the velocity in the thin layer  ς can be expressed as follows:

1-4 Literature Review 
 Linear stability analysis is a well known method in investigating the stability of a 
flow system by adding infinitesimal disturbances in the flow field. If the disturbances 
are found to grow with time, the flow is considered to be unstable; if the disturbances 
are damped, the flow is stable. Yih [10] in 1955 studied the linear stability of a liquid 
layer with a free surface flowing down an inclined plane numerically. Unfortunately, the 
predictions of the neutral instability curve and the corresponding wave speeds were 
incorrect. He thus made a corresponding correction in 1962 [11]. In this paper, he 
introduced the so-called normal modes analysis and treated the stability problem as an 
eigenvalue problem. The long-wave instability of the same flow situation with small 
Reynolds number was also studied by Benjamin [12]; the neutral stability condition was 
found analytically. Both the predictions attained by Yih and Benjamin provided good 
agreements with the experimental results by Binnie [13] for a water film flowing down 
a vertical plane. 
 Hooper analyzed both short-wave [14] and long-wave [15] linear stability of a 
plane Couette flow that contains two viscous immiscible fluids with the depth of the 
lower fluid being much less than the depth of the upper fluid. He concluded that the 
flow is always unstable for short-wave instability in the absence of surface tension. For 
long-wave instability, if the viscosity of the liquid in the lower layer is higher, then the 
flow is always unstable regardless of Reynolds number. Kao [16,17] investigated linear 
stability of a stratified fluid system consisting of two layers of viscous fluids of different 
densities but the same viscosity. He found that depending on whether the upper fluid is 
lighter or heavier than the lower one, the two-layer flow is, correspondingly, more stable 
or unstable than the homogeneous case of equal total depth,.  
 The mechanism of instability of a thin liquid film flowing down an inclined plane 
  13
investigated the instability of core-annular flow in a vertical pipe, i.e., the instability that 
involved the effects of gravity. Joseph [25] in 1991 analyzed the nonlinear stability of 
the core-annular flow at conditions near the neutral curve by studying the Ginzburg- 
Landau equation in his part IV paper. He studied this nonlinear instability by computing 
all the coefficients of the Ginzburg-Landau equation numerically and explored the 
bifurcation structure at criticality. He finally in 1992 presented the results of 
experiments in his part V paper [26] and made comparisons of the experimental results 
with theories. 
 Smith [27] in 1989 investigated the axisymmetric long-wave instability of a 
concentric two-phase pipe flow and explained the physical mechanism for the 
long-wave instability. He explained that when a bulge appears at the interface, an 
interfacial shear stress is induced which drives velocity perturbations in each of the 
fluids. The velocity perturbations interacting with the basic-state velocity produce an 
inertial pressure, which causes the bulge to grow. The interfacial shear stress is then 
increased and the cycle is repeated. Yan [28] in 2003 studied linear stability of 
gas-liquid two-phase flow (liquid core and gaseous annular film) in capillaries. The 
results showed that a dispersion relation was consistent with the prediction of the 
Kelvin-Helmholz stability theory and the neutral and fastest-growing wavelengths were 
relatively insensitive to the liquid viscosity. 
 
1-5 Scope of Present Study 
 The present study is aimed at theoretically investigating the stability of the co-axial 
vapor-thin-liquid-film flow in a micro-pipette. The flow is assumed incompressible and 
the range of the Knudsen number is about 0.01 0.1Kn< < . Therefore, the continuum 
model with slip boundary conditions has to be applied. Such a stability phenomenon has

Consider the co-axial vapor-thin-liquid-film flow in a circular tube of radius 0r . 
The vapor is in the core of the tube with the liquid film on the annulus. The schematic 
of the physical model and associated coordinate system are shown in Fig. 2-1. The thin 
liquid film of thickness   δ is originally attached to the inside wall of the tube. When 
disturbances are present, the interface between the vapor and liquid film becomes wavy 
and instability of the flow system may happen under certain conditions, which will be 
analyzed in the following chapters. In this chapter, the basic solutions for such a 
co-axial flow before disturbances are introduced will be studied and discussed. Two 
different flow situations are to be investigated; one is with no-slip boundary condition at 
the vapor-liquid interface and in the other, the slip boundary conditions at the interface 
need to be considered. 
The assumptions and governing equations are to be introduced in section 2-1. In 
section 2-2 and 2-3, the analytic solutions for the flow situations with and without 
no-slip boundary conditions at the vapor-liquid interface will be obtained. The results 
and discussion are finally given in section 2-4.

2-2 Basic Solutions for Flows with No-Slip Boundary Conditions 
When the Knudsen number of the entire flow is less than 0.01, the continuum 
model is valid, i.e., the flow fields can be described properly by the Navier-Stokes 
equations with the no-slip boundary conditions. Specifically, the velocity should be 
continuous at the vapor-liquid interface and vanishes at the inside wall of the tube. Thus, 
the flow can be treated as a Poiseulli flow. 
When the no-slip condition is applied, the following boundary conditions must be 
satisfied by the flow fields:

2-3 Basic Solutions for Flows with Slip Boundary Conditions 
As discussed previously, when dealing with micro-channel gaseous flows with the 
Knudsen number in the range 0.01 to 0.1, although the Navier-Stokes equations still 
remain valid, the no-slip boundary conditions need to be modified appropriately. At the 
vapor-liquid interface, the slip boundary condition has to be applied. However, the 
no-slip condition is still applicable at the liquid-solid boundary.  
Thus, the boundary conditions need to be satisfied by the flow fields are as follow: 
     2 0 0         at  W r r= = ,                     ……(2-9 a)

 As discussed previously, for a fixed pressure gradient, the volume flow rate of the 
vapor flow will keep increasing as the slip boundary condition becomes more and more 
prevalent. Such a flow phenomenon is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2-2 when the flow 
situation with 0.2α =% , the blue curve, possesses the greatest volume flow rate while 
the volume flow rate with no-slip boundary condition, the red curve, is the smallest. 
Moreover, as α%  increases, the velocity jump at the interface increases as well,

Chapter Three  
Disturbance Equations and Boundary Conditions 
When disturbances are introduced, the flow system may become unstable under 
certain conditions. The following chapters are aimed at investigating such an instability 
phenomenon. In this chapter, the linearized disturbance equations will be derived first in 
section 3-1, followed by the linearization of the boundary conditions for small 
disturbances in section 3-2. In section 3-3, the normal mode analysis will be introduced 
to facilitate the linear stability analysis in the next two chapters. Finally, in section 3-4, 
further simplification with negligence of disturbance evolution in the vapor phase is 
justified.

Fig. 3-1 shows the schematic of the physical model with small disturbances 
introduced at the interface. When disturbances are present, the interface between the 
vapor and liquid film becomes wavy. Without loss of generality, assume the small wavy 
disturbances to be sinusoidal with amplitude  η such that 1 η   and 1zη∂ ∂ <<  are 
satisfied.

3-3 Normal Mode Analysis 
To facilitate the linear stability analysis, the following normal modes for the small 
disturbances are assumed:

* *
* *ˆ ( ) j n kz ti iV V r e

where 1j = − ,  k is the dimensionless wavenumber, and ω is the dimensionless 
angular frequency. 
 In general, the angular frequency ω is a complex number. The sign of its 
imaginary part, i.e.,  iω , determines the stability of the flow system. When it is 
positive, the disturbances will grow exponentially and the flow becomes unstable 
eventually. When  iω is negative, the disturbances will decay exponentially and the flow 
remains stable. Neutral condition for small disturbances exists when iω vanishes. Such 
criteria for flow instability are summarized in the following:

3-4 Negligence of Disturbances in Vapor Phase 
 In this section, the negligence of disturbances in vapor phase will be justified by 
  37
Chapter Four  
Long-wave Stability Analysis 
 This chapter is aimed at analyzing the long-wave instability of the liquid film of a 
co-axial flow system with small axi-symmetric disturbances introduced at the interface. 
By applying the lubrication theory, the dimensionless equations and boundary 
conditions derived in chapter three are simplified. The onset conditions for the 
instabilities will then be determined analytically. As a result, the classical problem 
which deals with the instability of a stationary thin liquid film on the inside wall of a 
circular tube using lubrication approximation becomes the limiting case of the present 
study. 
 
4-1 Long-wave Stability Analysis 
 In this section, both the instability of the thin liquid film of a co-axial two-phase 
flow and the classical problem will be analyzed. Since only axi-symmetric disturbances 
will be considered in this chapter, '2V  and θ − derivatives vanish in Eqs. (3-3 a-d). 
 Being able to extend the present study to the classical problem, the 
non-dimensionalization scheme, i.e., Eq. (3-4), used in chapter three becomes 
inappropriate. Under the lubrication approximation, the viscous effect is mainly 
balanced by the pressure gradient in the z − direction, which, in turn, is estimated by 
the free surface deformation. The following non-dimensionalization scheme is thus 
introduced for the present situation:

only in the real part of ω , it will change solely the frequency of the oscillatory mode of 
the instability, not the onset wavenumber. Consequently, even with the basic flow and 
the slip boundary condition at the interface, the onset wavenumber should remain the 
same as predicted by the classical problem, which will be proved in the following. 
 Finally, since ( ),0

When the dimensionless wavenumber  k is smaller than onset k , the imaginary part of the 
dimensionless angular frequency is positive, resulting in the growth of disturbances as 
time proceeds. The flow is thus destabilized. When the dimensionless wavenumber   k is 
larger than onset k , the disturbances will be damped and the flow is stabilized.

need be introduced. However, they are eliminated by the application of appropriate

  49
(B) Determination of Onset Wavenumber: 
 With the aid of the command “Eigenvalues” in program TMMathematica , the 
complex eigenvalues ω  of the matrix equation Ax B xω=v v  with k , 2Re , We , *α , 
µφ , and ξ  specified can be computed. Since the thin liquid film is always unstable 
( )0iω >  with long-wave disturbances and becomes stable ( )0iω <  with short-wave 
disturbances, there thus exists a wavenumber onsetk  called the onset wavenumber for 
instability at which ( )Max 0iω = , i.e.,  
   ( )( )*onset 2Re ,  We, ,  ,  ; Max 0ik k µα φ ξ ω= = . 
The secant method will be employed to find such an onset condition. The criterion of 
convergence is 510−  between two consecutive computations of k . 
 
5-3 Results and discussion 
 In this section, the validity of the numerical computation will be justified first by 
the comparison with the analytical results presented in chapter four. Then, the onset 
conditions for the instability of the thin liquid film with basic flows will be numerically 
analyzed and discussed. 
 
5-3-1 Justification of Numerical Method 
 In order to simulate the instability of the thin liquid film under the lubrication 
approximation, the z − derivative of the velocity disturbances in the viscous term of the 
momentum equation is neglected and the Reynolds number 2Re  is assumed small to 
reduce the inertial effect. The results of numerical computation show that ω  is a 
complex number in general, i.e., the instability of the thin liquid film is of oscillatory 
mode generally. However, as 2Re  approaches zero, the real part of ω  diminishes and 
  51
onset 1
k ξξ= −  for the classical problem, the liquid film may still becomes unstable. The 
mechanism for the onset of instability seems to be modified by the inertia effect of the 
basic flow. Such a modification can be explained based on Eq. (3-32). When 2Re  is 
small enough such that the inverse of the Capillary number, 
2
2
1
Re
J
Ca
ξ= , becomes much 
larger than unity, the pressure variation is mainly reflected by the surface deformation as 
scaled in the classical problem. As a result, the onset condition approaches that of the 
classical problem, i.e., onset
10
1 9
k ξξ→ =− . For the other situation, when 
2
2
1
Re
J
Ca
ξ=  
decreases as 2Re  continues to increase, the pressure field should be re-scaled by the 
inertia effect of the basic flow instead of the surface deformation. The onset 
wavenumber onsetk  is thus modified accordingly. 
 The relation between the onset wave number onsetk  and 2Re  is shown in Fig. 5-3. 
It can be seen from Fig. 5-3 that the onset wavenumber, onsetk , keeps decreasing as Re2 
decreases and eventually approaches 
1
ξ
ξ − , the onset wavenumber for the classical 
problem, as discussed in last paragraph.  
The curve demarcating the stable and unstable regions in the ( )onset 2log Rek −  
plane is called the neutral instability curve. For the thin liquid film studied herein, the 
stable region lies in the right lower portion to the neutral instability curve with the other 
portion being the unstable region. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  53
(B) Effects of Surface Tension through J  
 The effects of J  on the instability of the thin liquid film with 32Re 10
−= , * 0α = , 
80µφ = , 10ξ = , and 4 3 210 ,  10 , 10J − − −=  are shown in Fig. 5-4. This figure shows that, 
as J  increases, the dimensionless growth rate of instabilities iω  increase rapidly 
while the onset wavenumber, onsetk , decreases. Since 22 4
2
J ρ σδµ ξ=  is directly 
proportional to the surface tension, a larger value of J , thus, indicates a larger surface 
tension with all other properties fixed, which results in a higher frequency of surface 
vibration and, consequently, a larger dimensionless growth rate of instabilities. 
 The neutral instability curves demarcating the stable and unstable regions in the 
( )onset 2log Rek −  plane with * 0α = , 80µφ = , 10ξ = , and 4 3 210 ,  10 , 10J − − −=  are 
shown in Fig. 5-5. It can be seen that, for a fixed value of 2Re , onsetk  always decreases 
with increasing J  and approaches the onset wavenumber of the classical problem for 
3
2Re 10
−< . As a result, the stable region becomes larger as J  increases or when a 
liquid film has stronger surface tension. 
 
 
  55
(C) Effects of Slip Boundary Condition through the Slip Constant, *α  
 The neutral instability curves in the ( )onset 2log Rek −  plane for the flow situation 
with 0.0072J = , 80µφ = , 10ξ = , and * 0,  2, 4α =  are shown in Fig. 5-6. For 
increasing value of *α , the unstable region for the thin liquid film decreases, indicating 
that the onset wavenumber, onsetk , decreases as 
*α  increases. Moreover, when 2Re  
decreases, the onset wavenumber, onsetk , approaches 1
ξ
ξ − , the onset wavenumber of 
the classical problem. However, for flow situations with a larger, *α , such an approach 
occurs at larger values of 2Re . Physically, it means that, when 
*α  increases or when 
the slip boundary condition becomes more prevailing, the drag force by the vapor flow 
is weaker resulting in a smaller liquid flow which is, consequently, closer to the 
classical problem. 
 
 
   Fig. 5–6 The neutral instability curves on the ( )onset 2log Rek −  plane 
     with 0.0072J = , 80µφ = , 10ξ = , and * 0α = (red), 2 (blue),
     and 4 (green). 
 
  57
curves on the ( )21 log Rek ξξ
⎛ ⎞− −⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠
 plane are shown in Fig. 5-8, which shows that, for 
both cases with or without basic flows, the onsetk  always decreases as ξ  increases and 
approaches 
1
ξ
ξ − , the onset wavenumber of the classical problem, for 2Re ~ 0.03< . 
This means that, with a smaller thickness, the liquid film can only become unstable 
when subject to disturbances of longer wavelengths. Consequently, the unstable region 
for a thinner liquid film is smaller that that for a thicker liquid film.

thus result in a higher frequency of oscillation, a larger dimensionless growth rate 
of instability, and a smaller range of onset wavenumber of instability. 
(c) The interfacial slip boundary condition will changes the onset wave number, 
varying between the one with no-slip boundary condition and that for a stationary 
liquid film, the classical problem. The frequency of the oscillatory mode of 
instability will be changed as well. 
(d) With a larger viscous ratio, i.e., when the liquid flow is much more viscous than 
the vapor flow, the velocity in the thin liquid film is reduced. As a result, the onset 
wavenumber of instability approaches that for a stationary liquid film, the classical 
problem. 
(e) With a smaller thickness, the liquid film can only become unstable when subject to 
disturbances of longer wavelengths. Consequently, the unstable region for a thinner 
liquid film is smaller that that for a thicker liquid film.  
 
 Finally, in order to improve the results, future works may include the disturbed 
flow of the vapor phase, consider the asymmetric disturbances, or study the flow 
situation with 1µφ <  or 1ρφ < , i.e., with the more viscous or heavier fluid in the core.

    近年來，將MEMS應用於生物晶片的設計與製造更是日益受到重視。
相較於傳統的方法，生物晶片具有低用量、省時、經濟等優點。其中省

因而使得氣、液相流動的耦合現象更形複雜，發生不穩定的條件、成因
