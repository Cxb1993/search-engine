3. 結果與討論 
The Jet, Sailboat, Tiffany, and House images, each with a size of 256ൈ256, were used as the secret 
images; and the Lena, Peppers, and Baboon images, each with size of 512ൈ512, were used as cover images 
in the experiment, as shown in Fig. 1. The stego image visual quality estimation, the stego image 
authentication and error correction capability, and secret image progressive reconstruction performance 
experiments were conducted. The integer wavelet transform derived from the Daubechies 5/3 biorthogonal 
wavelet, 4-level decomposition, SPIHT algorithm, and the modified (r, m) threshold scheme with r=2 and 
m=3, were used in the secret image sharing scheme. An irreducible polynomial 1xxxx 2348 ++++  was 
chosen as the prime polynomial in GF(28). The criterion for authentication capability is detection ratio (DR) 
against the tampered region defined as ܦܴ ൌ ܰܶܲܦ/ܰܶܲ, where NTP is the number of the tampered 
pixels, and NTPD is the number of the tampered pixels that are detected. 
 
 
3.1. Experiments on stego images visual quality estimation and discussion 
The experimental results for the visual quality (PSNR) of the stego images produced by the proposed 
method are shown in Fig. 2 in comparison to those obtained by the scheme proposed by Chang, the scheme 
proposed by Yang, and the Lin method, for embedding shadows of different secret images (Jet, Sailboat, 
Tiffany, and House) into the cover images (Lena, Peppers, and Baboon) using r=2 and m=3. For visual 
inspection, the Jet image was used as a secret image. The results of our proposed method are shown in Figs. 
3 (a), (b), and (c), respectively for the Lena, Peppers, and Baboon stego images. For comparison, the scheme 
proposed by Chang, the scheme proposed by Yang and the Lin method are shown in Figs. 3 (d), (e), (f), (g), 
(h), (i), (j), (k), and (l), for Lena, Peppers and Baboon stego images. These experimental results show that 
the proposed method has the highest visual quality of stego images with the highest PSNR among the 
comparison methods.  
3.2. Experiments on authentication capability and discussion 
Figure 4(a) shows the obviously modified stego image for an authentication capability test consisting 
of an image of pepper added into the upper-left corner of the Lena image. Note that the added pepper image 
satisfies the parity check policy. The authentication result of the stego image using the proposed method is 
shown in Fig. 4(b). For comparison, the authentication results of the stego image using the method proposed 
by Chang, the method proposed by Yang, and the Lin method are shown in Figs. 4(c), (d), and (e), 
respectively. It is clear that the proposed method has the highest authentication capability among the 
comparison methods. The detection ratio (DR) for the proposed method is 99.63 %. For the purpose of 
comparison, the detection ratios DRs for the method proposed by Chang, the method proposed by Yang, and 
the Lin method are 96.84 %, 51.86 %, and 0, respectively. It is clear that the proposed method has the 
highest authentication performance among comparison methods. According to the CRT and the HC features 
of the proposed method, the DR for stego block pairs in our proposed method embedding 8 check bits is 
255/256. In the method proposed by Chang et al., the DR for two stego blocks is 15/16ൈ15/16=225/256, 
which is smaller in comparison than that of the proposed method. It is clear that our method has higher 
authentication ability than that of the method proposed by Chang.
