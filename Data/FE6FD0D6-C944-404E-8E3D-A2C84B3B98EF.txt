ABSTRACT
The dual-branch selection-and-stay combining
(SSTC) is analyzed for a diversity reception on
independent and correlated Nakagami-m fading
channels, where the conventional selection combining
is employed only at the switching instance, and the
receiver will stay at the selected branch till its
estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes lower
than a preset threshold. For performance evaluations,
the average bit error rate (BER) of the SSTC is
derived for the binary PSK (BPSK), and coherent FSK
(CFSK). According to the numerical result, the SSTC
outperforms the SSC in the senses of the average BER.

1. INTRODUCTION
In a wireless channel, to compress the
multipath fading for a satisfied receiver
performance, different diversity combining
schemes have been considered in literatures. The
main conventional combining schemes are the
maximal-ratio combining (MRC), the equal-gain
combining (EGC), and the SC [1]-[2]. In a
mobile communication system with a dynamic
scenario, the implementation cost and
complexity of a diversity scheme become
important factors. Although the SC renders a
suboptimal performance, it is more practical
than the MRC or EGC for the implementation
consideration.
However, with the SC, the receiver site still
needs to continuously observe and estimate the
signal powers of all diversity branches for
choosing the branch with the largest SNR. To
implement a diversity system with less
complexity, the switched combining has been
considered for practical mobile communication
systems [3],[4]. In a diversity system with the
switched combining, the receiver only needs to
continuously estimate the power of the single
diversity branch currently in use. Different
decision policies of the switched combining
have been addressed. In the dual-branch SSC
scheme addressed in [5], the estimated signal
power of the used branch is compared to a preset
threshold, and the receiver will switch to another
branch only if this estimation is down-crossing
the threshold. In the dual-branch SSC considered
in [6] and [7], the switching occurs once the
estimated power is lower than the threshold. In
[8], various dual-branch SSC schemes were
addressed for different fading models, and the
SSC with an ambiguous estimation was
analyzed and compared to those presented in [5]
and [6]. In [9], the two-state Markov chain was
used to analyze the performance of the SSC on
independent and correlated Nakagami-m fading
channels. All these SSC schemes lead to a
similar receiver performance [8], [9]. The
switch-and-examine combining has been
specified in [10] as an alternative to the SSC. In
[11], a generalized scheme of switch-and-
examine combining was analyzed to improve the
SSC. By taking the advantages of the SC and
SSC, we have proposed the dual-branch SSTC
scheme and analyzed its outage probability in
[12].

For evaluating the receiver performance of the
SSTC, different signaling schemes are
considered. To simplify the performance
examination for the SSTC, without loss of
generality, identical switching thresholds (i.e.
1 2    ) are used in the following analysis,
and the SSTC for non-identical thresholds can
be assessed in a similar way with (5)-(6). When

The average BER for independent fading
channels will have a more compact form
(particularly for i.i.d. channels) than its
counterpart for correlated fading channels, and
can not be directly deduced from the counterpart
using a zero correlation coefficient. Thus,
independent channels and general correlated
channels are analyzed separately.

6The average BER versus the average SNR of
the independent channels with different values
of m is plotted in Fig. 1 for BPSK and CFSK,
where balanced average SNR 1 2    is
considered. The average BER for correlated
channels is depicted in Fig. 2 for BPSK and
CFSK, where apparently the correlation
degrades the performance. In the numerical
computation, the infinite series in (17) will
converge after 80 terms.
The average BER versus the decision
threshold is presented for independent channels
with different values of m in Fig. 3 for coherent
modulations. Similarly, the average BER for
correlated channels is given in Fig. 4. From
these results, the average BER will saturate
when the decision threshold is larger than a
specific value which depends on the fading
severity factor m.
For the balanced case, if the SSC diversity is
employed, the optimal switching threshold to
achieve a minimum average BER has been
obtained in [9] as

(18)
where 1b for BPSK, while 1/ 2b for CFSK.
This optimal threshold is used for the BER
comparison of the SSC, SC, and SSTC schemes.
The comparisons are presented in Fig. 5 and Fig.
6 for the BPSK, and CFSK, respectively. From
these comparisons, we conclude that the SSTC
outperforms the SSC, and the gain of the
average BER will be enhanced when the SNR or
the value of m becomes large.
3. CONCLUSIONS
The SSTC scheme utilizes the channel state
information of dual-branches in an efficient way.
The value of the switch threshold can be fixed or
varying, and is determined according to an
acceptable preset BER. The developed analysis
can also be employed for other fading channel
models with a little modification. For a very
large switching threshold, the SSTC will turn
into the SC, which also supplies an alternative
method to derive a closed-form BER of the SC
over correlated fading channels. The SSTC
outperforms the SSC in the senses of the average
BER.
