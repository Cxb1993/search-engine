1. Introduction 
Recently, the desire to reduce vehicle 
weight and improve fuel efficiency has 
raised the need for the deformation of large 
complex-shaped products made of Mg 
alloys. Carpenter et al. [1] reported that 
research and development in North America 
on magnesium for automotive applications 
and also indicated that Mg alloy is a 
promising candidate for light weighting. 
Conventional stamping of Mg alloys into 
sheet parts is limited by their relatively low 
formability. Superplastic forming (SPF) is 
an effective method to overcome this 
limitation. From the viewpoint of applied 
mechanics, one of the most important 
characteristics of superplastic materials is 
their high strain-rate sensitivity of flow 
stress. The strain-rate sensitivity exponent, 
m (in the approximation of mK  ), is 
the key in controlling the ductility of a 
superplastic material at elevated 
temperatures. In other words, the higher the 
value of m, the higher is the necking 
resistance. However, fine-grained 
superplastic materials exhibit high m-values 
only in a narrow range of strain rates, thus 
requiring careful process control to maintain 
the desired constant strain rate during SPF. 
Yin et al. [2] showed that a superplastic 
elongation of 362.5% is obtained in AZ31 
Mg alloy at the temperature of 400 °C and 
strain rate of 7×10−4 s−1. Abu-Farha and 
Khraisheh [3] reported that approximately 
103 s1 strain rate is the threshold for 
superplasticity in AZ31alloy. A significant 
problem in the commercial application of 
SPF on AZ31B alloy is the low deformation 
rates (103–104 s1), which is undesirable in 
mass production. 
Superplasticity corresponds to deforma- 
tion conditions in which grain boundary 
sliding (GBS) is the dominant controlling 
mechanism, with an m-value of close to 0.5. 
However, the dislocation creep is expected 
to be the major deformation mechanism at 
higher strain rates and/or at lower 
temperatures. Non-superplastic behavior in 
AZ31 alloy with an m-value of 0.2 has been 
reported by Panicker et al. [4]. Watanabe et 
al. [5] showed that at strain rates over 
1×10−2 s−1 at 548 K, m decreased to a small 
value, indicating that deformation probably 
corresponds to dislocation creep. Although 
the m-value of dislocation creep is not as 
high as that of GBS creep, dislocation creep 
produces medium strain-rate sensitivity 
exponent (m = 0.33 to 0.2) and can provide 
sufficient tensile ductility. Watanabe et al. [6] 
reported that a high ductility of 196% at 375 
°C observed in a coarse-grained AZ31 Mg 
alloy is attributed to the deformation 
mechanism of glide-controlled dislocation 
creep. Del Valle et al. [7] indicated that the 
enhanced ductility of the AZ31 alloy in the 
lower strain-rate regime is attributed to the 
concurrent operation of GBS and 
crystallographic slip. These results indicate

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Tensile tests 
3.1.1 Tensile flow behavior 
The uniaxial tensile curves obtained at a 
strain rate of 4×103 s1 and various 
temperatures are given Fig. 3. The flow 
curve exhibits the power law constitutive 
relation until peak stress is reached. At this 
level, a softening region leading to fracture 
was observed. Additionally, a lower 
hardening effect and a longer softening 
region leading to fracture were noted on 
testing at higher temperatures. Fig. 4 shows 
the true stress–strain relationships of the 
fine-grained AZ31B Mg alloy sheet on 
testing at 400 °C and various strain rates. 
The flow curve in a relatively high strain 
rate range of 1×102 to 1×101 s1 reaches a 
peak value, then decreases followed by 
fracture. The flow curve at a lower strain 
rate of 4×10−3 s−1 transforms into a 
steady-state regime, wherein the flow stress 
is almost independent of strain at higher 
strains. 
The elongation to failure as a function of 
strain rate is given in Fig. 5. From the figure, 
tensile elongation evidently depends on the 
strain rate and temperature. The elongation 
to failure decreases with increasing strain 
rate, however, the extent of decrease 
depends on temperature. The effect of the 
strain rate on elongation is more pronounced 
at higher temperatures of 350400 °C. A 
large elongation of more than 200% was 
attained in the strain rate range of under 10‒2 
s‒1 at 400 °C. 
 
3.1.2. Hot deformation characteristics 
Jonas et al. [10] indicated that the 
constitutive equation to describe the high 
temperature deformation is generally 
expressed as 



RT
QA n exp                  (1) 
where   is the strain rate, A is a constant, σ 
is the flow stress, n is the stress exponent 
(=1/m, m is the strain rate sensitivity 
exponent), R is the gas constant, T is the 
absolute temperature and Q is the activation 
energy for diffusion, which is dependent on 
the rate controlling process. Eq. (1) can be 
rewritten as 
A
nTnR
Q
n
ln11ln1ln 

           (2) 
According to Eq. (2), n is the slope of the 
line in the plot of ln   versus ln σ at 
constant strain and temperature. The value 
of Q can be calculated using the slope of the 
line in the plot of ln σ versus 1/T at constant 
strain and strain rate. 
With regard to the approximation, the 
peak stress is used as one of the 
representative flow stresses to evaluate the 
deformation mechanisms. The stress 
exponent, n, obtained in the present work 
was approximately 3.7–7.3 (m = 0.27–0.14), 
as shown in Fig. 6. The n-value can 
influence the deformation mechanism of the 
fine-grained alloys. Watanabe et al. [11] 
investigated the dominant diffusion process 
for superplastic flow in an AZ61 magnesium 
alloy. Their results indicated that the n-value 
of 2 suggests that GBS could be a dominant 
deformation process. For higher strain rates, 
the n-value is significantly increased to 
approximately 5, and the deformation 
mechanism is related to dislocation creep. 
Dislocation creep behavior in Mg–Al–Zn

radius and forming time was observed. 
Variations in fillet radius with forming time 
are similar for both pressurization profiles. 
The reduction in fillet radius can be 
characterized by three distinctive regions: 
initially, the radius decreases rapidly, then a 
lower reduction rate stage is reached, and 
finally, a quite low decreasing rate occurs in 
the later stage of forming. The final fillet 
radii are 1.7 and 1.5 mm for forming at 
CP350-105 and CP350-165, respectively. It 
takes approximately 90 and 60 s for the fillet 
radii reducing from 2.0 to 1.5 mm and from 
2.5 to 1.7 mm for forming at CP350-165 and 
CP350-106, respectively. These results 
imply that the fillet radius is one of the key 
factors influencing forming time for closed 
die gas blow forming. Although a smaller 
fillet radius can be reached, the forming time 
may increase tremendously. The forming 
time for forming a component with a very 
small fillet radius appears non-cost effective 
for industrial applications. 
 
3.2.3. Thickness evolution 
Thickness evolution at the center point of 
the deformed sheet with forming time is 
given in Fig. 11. Different thinning 
behaviors were observed for forming at 
different pressurization profiles. At the 
beginning of forming, the thickness 
decreases rapidly with forming time for both 
pressurization profiles. Then, after the sheet 
comes in contact with the bottom surface of 
the die, the thickness still decreases with 
forming time for forming at CP350-165, 
whereas the thickness remains constant for 
forming at CP350-106. The thinning 
behavior can be associated with the pressure 
imposed during forming. After the sheet has 
been overlaid on the die surface, surface 
friction restricts the metal flow of the 
overlaid region. A higher pressure of 3.2 
MPa imposed for forming at CP350-106 
provides more restriction on the metal flow, 
resulting in a constant thickness at the center 
point in the later stage of forming. These 
results are consistent with the metal flow 
shown in Fig. 9. 
 
3.2.4. Thickness distribution 
The effect of imposed pressure on the 
thickness distribution of the formed 
rectangular pan is demonstrated in Fig. 12. 
Different distributions in thickness along the 
transverse cross-section were observed for 
forming at two different pressures. The 
thinnest positions locate at approximately 18 
and 20 mm away from the bottom center of 
the formed pan for forming at CP350-106 
and CP350-165, respectively. However, a 
more uniform thickness distribution was 
observed for forming at CP350-165. The 
degree of the interfacial friction influences 
the metal flows after contacting, and the 
interfacial friction is large for forming at 
CP350-106. When the sheet comes in 
contact with the die surface, the deformation 
in that contact area is restricted. Additionally, 
thinning is localized in the non-contact areas, 
resulting in a greater degree of thinning. If 
the interfacial friction is reduced, such as in 
the case where a lower pressure of 2.6 MPa 
is applied, the thinning gradient of the 
formed part is reduced because continued 
metal flow after contact is possible. The 
thinning effect of the deformed sheet on 
forming at CP350-165 continues to take
