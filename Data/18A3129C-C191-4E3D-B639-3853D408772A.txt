branches is a minimum. To our best 
understanding, the optimization algorithms for 
the MSP solution known so far have been 
fallen into three categories, they are: cut-set 
optimization, routing-path optimization [2,3,4],  
  In recently, the numerical method of 
minimum-span for a graph has been provided 
by Juang [15]. The network model that 
represents a graph is created by a flow-table 
[6], in which columns of an incidence matrix 
[5] for this network are arranged based on the 
branch-cost. Then the fundamental cut-set [5], 
[7], [9] can be identified through row-reduced 
echelon-form (RREF) processing [6], [7], [8] 
of this matrix. Accordingly, a tree with 
possibly minimal cost (MSP) can be found. 
 
B. Maximum-Flow Problem (MFP) 
  The objective of the maximum-flow 
problem (MFP) is to develop a shipping 
schedule that maximizes the amount of 
material sent from the source (the origin node) 
to the sink (the destination node). MFP can be 
solved by linear programming [1] or by the 
Ford-Fulkerson method [10].  
  The maximum-flow of a transportation 
network can also be obtained from the 
minimum-cut of the network, known as 
min-cut/max-flow property [5,9]. And 
consequently, MFP can be solved via the 
numerical method as provided by Juang [15]. 
This is addressed as Min-Cut/Max-Flow 
Problem in the above mentioned paper. The 
concept of MCP is described as follows. 
 
C. Minimum-Cut Problem (MCP) 
  The objective of the minimum-cut problem 
(MCP) is to find a cut that separates the source 
node from the sink, wherein the equipped cut 
value is a minimum. Because maximum-flow 
implies minimum-cut for a transport network, 
and MCP can also be solved via MFP via the 
numerical method. [15] 
 
D. Shortest-Path Problem (SPP) 
  The objective of the shortest-path problems 
(SPP) is to determine a path joining the source 
and the sink such that the sum of the costs 
associated with those branches in this proposed 
path is a minimum. As surveying from the 
existing literature, the following labeling 
process, or algorithms alike have been used: 
Dijkstra’s algorithm [11], Dial’s algorithm [12], 
and Label Correcting algorithm [13],[14].  
  In order to find the shortest-path, one can 
find the Min-cut for its dual graph (The 
Min-cut capacity for its dual network) [5]. 
Therefore, the solution of SPP can be obtained 
via MCP conventionally. As contrast to the 
usual practice, the numerical method achieving 
shortest-path for a network is disclosed in this 
project. 
 
 
2. Preliminaries 
A directed graph that is connected and 
contains no loops is a transport network. In this 
network, if there is one node, a, that has no 
incoming branches; it is called the source. 
Similarly, if there is another node, z, which has 
no outgoing branches; it is the sink. Associated 
with each branch (arc), one defines a 
nonnegative number called the capacity of the 
branch (arc). In the MSP or SPP, the equipped 
non-negative number  is a cost (e.g. length, 
distance, etc.) associated with each branch 
connecting two nodes. 
A. Flow table 
For a graph with N nodes and B branches, 
the incidence matrix is an N-row, B-column 
array [ ]ikm=M , where

 node enters branch if
incidence no has branch  if
 node leaves branch if
 (1) 
 
If all the columns of the incidence matrix M 
are rearranged according to the ascending (or 
descending) order of the equipped costs, the 
resultant matrix is called a flow table, and the 
associated numerical procedure is called 
pre-label processing.

 f3 = {bc; cb, ac, bz}. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. MSP Algorithm 
Given a graph of N nodes and B branches, 
each branch has an associated cost, the MSP 
algorithm is proposed as followings.  
Algorithm 1 (Minimum-Span Algorithm) 
step1. (Flow table procedure) 
1.1 Create an N-row, B-column incidence 
matrix [ ]ikm=M  as defined by (1). 
1.2 Pre-label Processing: Rearrange the 
columns of M according to the 
ascending orders of the cost of each 
branch to get a flow table Q. 
step2. (Echelon-form processing) 
2.1 Do Gaussian-Jordan elimination on the 
flow table Q, then delete the last zero 
row, and get the RREF flow-table QE . 
2.2 There are N-1 rows in QE carrying N-1 
independent cut-sets information for the 
graph. 
step3.  (MST processing) 
3.1 Post-label Processing: Rearrange 
columns of QE until the matrix falls 
into the form of [ ]FI1=S , here I1 is 
an identity matrix of order N-1. 
3.2 The branches related to the unity 
column vectors are the feasible tree 
branches, and they constitute the MST 
of the network. 
3.3 Each row of S carries the fundamental 
cut-set information for the graph.

4. Shortest-Path Algorithm 
We first illustrate the proposed procedures 
for solving this problem by a numerical 
example, and then SPP algorithm will be 
summarized. 
A. An illustrative example 
Consider the network shown in Fig.1, for the 
proposed SPP solution, we first append a 
hypothetical link (dotted line) za, from the sink 
to the source node, with capacity set to be 0, as 
depicted by the dotted line in Fig. 3. The 
network then has 7 branches instead of 6, 
accordingly we reiterate B = 7. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Firstly, the MSP algorithm (Algorithm 1) 
proposed in section III.B of this report can be 
utilized to find the MST. The flow table Q for 
the network is described in Table 3.

Step3.  (SPP processing) 
3.1 Obtain the matrix T as defined in (3). 
3.2 Identify all the feasible tie-sets. 
3.3 Identify the Shortest-Paths.  
■ 
 
For the above numerical example, the flow 
table Q is shown in Table 3; the row-reduced 
echelon- form (RREF) flow-table QE in Table 
4, which happens to be the matrix S, too.  
  The minimum-span tree (MST) is {za, cb, 
ab}; and fundamental cut sets: f1, f2, f3, are 
shown in Fig.2. 
  Table 5 depicts the matrix T, and there are 
four fundamental tie-sets. All rows of T whose 
first column (za-column) being a 1 stand for 
the feasible tie-sets. And we have three of them: 
L1, L3, and L4, as depicted in Table 6. Among 
these three tie-sets, L3 has the smallest total 
cost of 10, and therefore the shortest-path (SP) 
is identified to be: {ac, cz}. 
 
 
5. Conclusions 
  A novel numerical method for the solution 
of Shortest-Path problem of a network model 
is presented in this project. Minimum-Span 
Algorithm and Shortest-Path Algorithm have 
been presented accordingly. These two 
algorithms can be utilized to solve the 
important optimization problems analyzed by 
network models: minimum-span problems 
(MSP), minimum-cut problem problems 
(MCP), maximum-flow problems (MFP), and 
shortest-path problems (SPP).
