U2. Abstract U 
At the third year of three-years innovation study for design and fabrication of a 
high performance micro proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack. The effect 
of different operating parameters on micro PEM fuel cells performances was 
experimentally studied for different channel-to-rib width ratios of flowfield plates 
configurations (co-flow design). The micro PEM fuel cells were designed and 
fabricated in-house through a deep UV lithography technique and the SU-8 
photoresist was used as microstructure mold for fuel cell flowfield plates when micro 
electroforming. In this study, the performance test (VI and PI curve) were carried out 
to get in information on examining the effect of the serpentine flowfield patterns, as 
well as the operational parameters such as different cell temperature, backpressure of 
micro PEM fuel cells. Experimental results are presented in the form of polarization 
VI curves and PI curves under above operating conditions. The influence of the 
aforementioned parameters was presented and discussed. 
 
Keywords: Micro proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack, micro 
electroforming, channel-to-rib width ratios 
 
U3. Introduction 
The application of fuel cells to portable power is motivated by numerous 
occasions such as 3C products. Further, the use of microfabrication technology for 
fulfillment of power generation has ever been increased with being widely and 
generally demanded in portable electronic applications especially for 3C products.

300, 450, and 600 µm with a definite channel width (300 µm). The resulting 
channel-to-rib width ratio is listed in Table 1 with relevant geometric variables of the 
channel. Following Hsieh et al. [8], the flowfield plates were fabricated with copper 
metal sheets by using LIGA-like (LIGA; a German acronym for lithographie 
galvanoformung abformung) microfabrication process of deep ultraviolet (UV) 
lithography to obtain SU-8 (2100) resist patterns/and SU-8 mould [8]. 
 
z Reliability and durability examination 
As stately previously, the single cell performance was tested for long range runs 
(> 2 months) and each test lasts at least 5 hrs. The VI/PI curves for all five different 
cases were examined as show in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(b) shows open circuit voltage (OCV) 
profiles history for 5 hours and it clearly suggests that the present copper sheet 
flowfield plates perform very well as far as the reliability and durability are concerned, 
which suggests the copper corrosion rate appears of no significance. Further 
inspection of this behavior can be done via an SEM examination of the used flowfield 
plates after two months as shown in Fig. 2(c). 
 
z Optimal channel-to-rib width ratio vs VI/PI curves and pressure drop 
The electrode-electrolyte assemblies were investigated in a fuel cell. Purified 
(99.9%) and dry hydrogen is fed into the cell from a gas cylinder through a mass flow 
meter and back-pressure valve and compressed air was provided. The inlet flow rate 
of dry HB2 B and air were regulated at 10 and 50 sccm, respectively, under different back 
pressures of 97, 153, and 207 kPa. These parameters also listed in Table 2 were 
controlled by a microprocessor based temperature controller and two back-pressure 
regulators. 
 
U5. Conclusion 
 
z Sample (including flow channel) preparation 
Fig. 3 shows the brief fabrication steps with proper parameters as listed in Table 
2. Figs. 4(a) to (e) show the images of a scanning examination microscope (SEM) and 
an atomic force microscope (AFM) examination, respectively. All samples had an 
active area of 2.25 cm long and 2.25 cm wide (5cmP2 P). The flow channel was 2.25 cm 
long. 
 
z Reliability and durability examination 
While for the rib surface, the growth of the oxide layer can clearly be noted and 
the growth rate was found to be about 0.06 µm/hr. Based on the observation, one can
