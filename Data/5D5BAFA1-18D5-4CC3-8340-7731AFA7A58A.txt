behaviors in the host cell. Then, we will design 
engineering specifications so that the synthetic IC 
gene network can be guaranteed to be robust enough to 
perform its desired behavior. After intensive 
computation simulations to confirm their robust 
performance, the genetic IC circuits are synthesized 
and then inserted into the host cell for in vivo

biology and engineering to produce programmable 
biological systems.

temperature-controlled promoter-RBS element. 3. 
Control of carotenoid synthesis pathway using 
temperature-controlled promoter-RBS element. 4. 
Implementation of isobutanol synthesis pathway in E. 
coli plasmid. 5. Standard operation procedure for 
promoter-RBS library construction. In the following 
three years, biological IC circuits will be 
integrated to verify and demonstrate the novel 
functions of programmed cells. The genetic circuits 
will be used to control the expression of series of 
metabolic proteins at the precise time and amount 
required for the maximal synthesis of a drug or 
energetic compound. This project aims not only to

(二)英文摘要 
The main goal of synthetic biology is to design and reconstruct biological systems in an organism by 
engineering methods and molecular biology techniques to present some desired behaviors. At present, the 
design and development of genetic IC circuits are still difficult and most newly created genetic IC circuits 
only function in a very short time and decay quickly. These intrinsic parameter fluctuations and external 
disturbances currently hinder us from engineering biological systems with the confidence to perform specific 
work. In this project, the parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances of engineered genetic IC 
circuits are modeled as a nonlinear stochastic system to mimic the realistic behaviors in the host cell. Then, 
we will design engineering specifications so that the synthetic IC gene network can be guaranteed to be robust 
enough to perform its desired behavior. After intensive computation simulations to confirm their robust 
performance, the genetic IC circuits are synthesized and then inserted into the host cell for in vivo experiments. 
The systems design theory from electrical engineering is applied to biological systems in this project, which 
opens an interdisciplinary field that integrates molecular biology and engineering to produce programmable

計畫成果報告內容 
【前言】 
合成生物學與傳統基因工程不同之處，在於合成生物學是由工程系統的角度設計，尋找適當的生
物控制元件組裝後來達成目標，存在 DNA元件標準化、模組化的概念。DNA元件上如果能夠標準化，
可以促使基因迴路組裝更為迅速，並能預先參照標準化的 DNA元件輸入及輸出訊號，模擬出組裝後的
基因迴路功能。合成生物學特色就是可以運用之前已做成的模組，繼續做進一步的基因迴路組裝，不
必每次都從頭開始。因此成果是逐漸累積的，可以合併前人組裝出的生物元件，設計出更加複雜的基
因調控網路，並可應用強大的工程工具(例如：電腦輔助設計)，來處理由此而來的複雜性。 
傳統遺傳工程學可在細菌或生物中嵌入少數基因，使生物體內目標蛋白質大量表現。但是在新興
的合成生物學中，則是以更廣泛的規模重新設計生物體基因迴路，外加的將不是單一基因，而是要改
變過去的單基因移轉技術，將基因群組裝為基因迴路後轉移至宿主細胞，使其表現出全新的基因調控
網路(gene regulatory network)，創造出程式化控制生物行為。可用工程領域的邏輯閘(logic gate)對應到
基因間的調控模組。這些對應邏輯閘的生物基因調控模組即為合成生物學中最重要的概念—生物 DNA
模組。在工程理論中，只要組合適當的邏輯閘模組，即可設計出執行特定功能的電路。將此元件互換
及邏輯閘模組組合的概念引入遺傳工程中，即可利用分子生物學技術，把生物 DNA 元件組成基因迴
路，將遺傳工程拓展到多基因研究。 
 
【研究目的】 
現今架構生物 IC電路面臨的難題是生物電路在細胞內表現短暫功能後會逐漸崩潰，無法穩定運作
於細胞中。基因表達時的雜訊，不同 RNA剪裁、DNA突變及熱擾動等造成內在生化參數變動，以及
細胞環境變遷與其他基因交互作用所造成的干擾，都會使人工製造出來的基因電路無法穩定運作。因
此如何設計可以忍受內在及外界干擾的強健基因網路，是生物 IC電路亟待解決的重要課題。在生物體
中建構基因電路需要瞭解生物細胞中許多未知的生化參數，例如 mRNA及蛋白質的穩定性，DNA與
蛋白質的交互作用等等。為了克服此難題，我們將建立生物元件 DNA序列資料庫並量測其輸出訊號表
現強度，此資料庫可以提供構築基因電路所需之生物元件。不過現今生物元件庫組合還不夠多，往往
只能先組裝出最接近設計藍圖的生物 IC電路。這種無法精確組裝的生物 IC電路不見得可以在宿主細
胞中穩定運作，這也是現今已發表的生物電路無法穩定表現的原因之一。 
微生物只需要轉殖外來基因修改原有生化合成途徑，就可以製造出藥物或可當能源使用的化合
物。傳統多基因轉殖生合成途徑都是將基因群組裝於過量表現之啟動子之後，使生合成途徑所需蛋白
質過量表現，但是過量表現外來蛋白質會消耗菌體本身有限生長資源，而且中間產物可能過量累積造
成生物毒性，使細菌生長減緩，還有副產物生成，無法達到產量最佳化。本計畫引入全新的生合成途
徑設計理論，控制生合成途徑個別基因表現量，使基因群足夠生合成途徑進行，但卻不會過量表現，
消耗菌體生長資源。應用此多基因生合成路徑設計技術可以突破現有分子生物學多基因轉殖不易成功
的瓶頸。不僅能用於生質丁醇生產，更能推廣到其他生質能源，製藥工程等領域，將是遺傳工程及合
成生物學的突破性進展。 
 
【文獻探討】 
經過基因改造的微生物只需要做一些生化合成途徑修改，就可以製造出一些藥物或能源的化合
物。例如以多個基因轉殖於大腸桿菌，組合成藥物合成路徑，使其合成抗瘧疾藥物青蒿素(artemisnin)
的研究是生物基因電路的重要成就之一。由苦艾草純化的青蒿素能有效對抗瘧疾，但是由於含量太稀
少，使得萃取成本很高。美國 Keasling教授的研究團隊對代謝途徑作了重新設計，在大腸桿菌中插入
 3 
 
【研究方法】 
單純的電機元件轉成生物元件後，就有許多生物參數需要控制。但在生物中有許多行為尚未完全
被瞭解，例如不同的啟動子 DNA序列到底會對應多少強度的 mRNA表現，這是很難事先預測的。除
非針對特定的啟動子 DNA序列實際設計實驗去偵測下游基因表現強度，不然生物學家只能告知啟動子
強或弱的大概區間。不過在生物 IC電路設計流程中，如果要開出強健性電路設計規格，就會規定每一
個基因的表現強度一定要在哪些範圍。生物學家拿到此設計藍圖，因為生物元件庫組合還不夠多，往
往無法由生物元件庫中取得所需元件，只能先組裝出最接近設計藍圖的生物 IC電路。這種大概組裝出
來的生物 IC電路不見得可以在宿主細胞中穩定運作，這也是現今已發表的生物電路無法穩定表現的原
因之一。 
為克服上述生物元件庫可調控元件不足的困難，本計畫將引入定向演化技術增加可調控元件種
類，改良生物 IC電路組裝無法逼近設計藍圖的問題。定向演化概念是利用分生技術在 DNA序列產生
些許改變，模擬自然界的突變作用，使子代的變異性增加，之後在突變子代中選取想要特性。利用
error-prone PCR技術、DNA shuffling或是 random point mutagenesis等分生技術在啟動子及核糖體結合
區域（ribosome binding site: RBS）的 DNA序列做一些點突變，這可以使啟動子轉錄強度及 RBS轉譯
強度發生強化弱的些微變化。我們再由各種不同調控強度組合的生物 IC電路中，選取最接近設計藍圖
的子代，即可以逐漸逼近設計藍圖。 
 
【結果與討論】 
本年度計畫主要目的為(1)建立多樣化的生物元件資料庫(2)降低基因迴路在宿主細胞的突變機
率，增加基因迴路於宿主細胞中的穩定性(3)設計強健性的基因迴路，使其能在內部雜訊及外加干擾存
在下，還能持續穩定表現(4)利用實驗數據修正基因迴路運作的動態方程組，使基因迴路的表現可以由
數學模型模擬再現，進一步預測出不同基因迴路運作的動態形式。 
目前具體成果如下： 
一、在大腸桿菌中成功建構具有計時器與計數器功能之基因迴路 
利用生物 IC設計觀念，我們設計出一種生物OR邏輯閘，其可以接收Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)
及乳糖兩種形式外來訊號，當 AHL存在或是培養基中乳糖耗盡，基因迴路即會將輸出訊號逐步由綠螢
光轉換為黃螢光，最後顯示到紅螢光輸出。將此種生物 OR 邏輯閘組裝到大腸桿菌中，可以將大腸桿
菌改造為一種具有計時器及偵測細菌菌數功能的生物偵測器（圖一）。

AHL和 LuxR蛋白質結合，驅動 Plux啟動子，使紅螢光蛋

第二種溫控元件為 42度誘發的 PCI 啟動子序列。PCI 啟動子在 42度以下溫度會被 CI 抑制子抑制，
當培養溫度高於 42 度時，CI 抑制子會因高溫產生構形改變，失去抑制作用，使 PCI 啟動子開始轉錄
下游基因。將此 42度開啟 PCI 啟動子序列後面接綠螢光蛋白基因後轉殖到大腸桿菌，在不同培養溫度
下測量綠螢光蛋白隨時間的表現量（圖五）。結果顯示當基因前面啟動子以此 42度開啟 PCI 啟動子取
代後，基因在 42度以上高溫均有較強表現，顯示此 42度開啟 PCI 啟動子真正具有溫控功能。 
 
 
三、應用溫控 DNA元件，控制胡蘿蔔素生合成路徑 
溫控胡蘿蔔素生合成路徑設計如圖六。此設計可使同一個基因電路，因為不同溫度調節方式，而
生產出目標比例中的茄紅素、胡蘿蔔素與葉黃素。一個持續性表現啟動子持續表現 crtE、crtB與 crtI，
製造茄紅素。crtY基因前接 37度開啟 RNA溫控序列，當溫度高於 37度時，此 crtY基因開始表現，
將茄紅素催化成胡蘿蔔素。crtZ基因前接 42度開啟 PCI 啟動子序列，當溫度高於 42度時，此 crtZ基

測量時間，每隔 15 分鐘進行一次測量。結果顯示當基因
前面 RBS以此溫控序列取代後，基因在 37度以上高溫均
有較強表現，顯示此 DNA元件真正具有溫控功能。

一次測量。結果顯示當基因受到 42度開啟 PCI 啟動
子序列控制時，基因在 42度以上高溫均有較強表現，
顯示此 DNA元件真正具有溫控功能。

五、提出三種類型的 Promoter-RBS元件庫的建立步驟 
本計畫的目的之一為提出一龐大的生物元件庫，以供未來的設計使用。為了此目的，建立生物元
件庫必須採用系統鑑別技術進行元件之特性化，再依一簡單且標準之流程來建立。 
由於 DNA轉錄成 mRNA再轉譯成蛋白質的這段過程中，仰賴著啟動子(promoter)及核糖體結合區
域(ribosome binding site, RBS)的分工。本計畫將此兩個元件合稱為一個 Promoter-RBS元件，並著手設
計實驗及進行系統鑑別工作。一般而言，依照啟動子的特性可以分成三類啟動子：(1) 持續表現型啟動
子(constitutive promoter)。(2) 抑制子調控型啟動子(repressor-regulated promoter)。(3) 活化子調控型啟
動子(activator-regulated promoter)。於是我們在計畫中，將這三種啟動子加上核糖體結合區域，產生三
類的 Promoter-RBS元件，並依照這三類元件分別進行鑑別工作，以利未來生物電路設計的使用。

II. ROBUST H∞ SYNCHRONIZATION FOR
NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC TIME-DELAYED
COUPLED NETWORKS
Nonlinear stochastic time-delayed coupled networks are
developed to interpret the dynamic behavior of realistic com-
plex coupled networks under time delays, random intrinsic
parameter fluctuations and external disturbances. Then the
robust synchronization of nonlinear stochastic time-delayed
coupled networks is discussed from the stochastic stability
perspective.
Consider a class of nonlinear time-delayed coupled net-
works as follows
dxi = f(xi)dt+
m∑
j=1
cij [g(xj , xτ,j)dt] , i = 1, . . . ,m (1)
xi(t0)  xi(t) ∀ t ∈ [−τ , 0], where xi  xi(t) ∈ Rn denotes
the ith network with n states. xτ,j  xj(t− τ) is the delayed
state with time delay τ . The time delay τ may be attributed to
interaction delays in the network couplings. m is the number
of networks (nodes). We use the symbol [[cij ]]m×m for an
m×m matrix with i, j entry cij . The matrix C  [[cij ]]m×m [

represents the coupling strength and
the coupling configuration of the coupled network. If there is
a connection from the jth network to the ith network, then
cij = 0; otherwise cij = 0, and the diagonal elements of
matrix C are defined by [2], [21]
cii = −

cij . (2)
In the real physical systems, the coupled networks in (1)
always suffer from stochastic intrinsic fluctuations. By the Itô
stochastic differential equation, the coupled networks in (1)
are modified to the following stochastic process [8], [9], [10],
[12]

nominal nonlinear interactions of the ith network and the

for any weighting matrix R = RT > 0.
Let BH∗ be the set of x(t) such that E‖x(t)‖ ≤ H∗ where
H∗ be a positive real number and E be the expectation. For the
synchronization behavior, the trajectories of all nodes approach
each other, some definitions are defined as follows
Definition 1: The system (4) is synchronized in probability
with respect to H∗ if for each  > 0 there exists δ() such
that if E‖xi(t0) − xj(t0)‖ ≤ δ() and xi(t0) ∈ BH∗ for all
i, j ∈ {1, · · · ,m}, then E‖xi(t) − xj(t)‖ ≤  for all t ≥ t0
and all i, j ∈ {1, · · · ,m}.
Definition 2: The system (4) is asymptotically synchro-
nized in probability if it is synchronized and there exists δ > 0
such that for all  > 0 there exists T () ≥ 0 such that if
E‖xi(t0) − xj(t0)‖ ≤ δ and xi(t0) ∈ BH∗ for all i, j ∈
{1, · · · ,m} and t ≥ t0+T (), then E‖xi(t)−xj(t)‖ ≤  for
all i, j ∈ {1, · · · ,m}.
Definition 3: A function α: R → R is said to belong to
class K, if 1) α(·) is continuous and non-decreasing, 2) α(0) =
0, 3) α(p) > 0, ∀p > 0.
We say that the coupled network in (4) is asymptotical syn-
chronization in probability if there exists a globally decrescent
Lyapunov function V (t,x) such that
αa(d(x)) ≤ V (t,x) ≤ αb(d(x)) and ELV ≤ −αc(d(x))

Ak, AWi,k, Di,k, Gk, Gτ,k, GWj ,k and GWjτ,k are the fuzzy

We define a diagonal fuzzy weighting matrix for coupled
networks as
µk(x)  diag(µk(x1)In, · · · , µk(xm)In) ∈ R

. Some properties for µk(x) can be obtained as follows.
Lemma 1: Using the properties of Kronecker product, we
have the following properties for µk(x).
1) µk(x)(Im⊗Ak) = (Im⊗Ak)µk(x) ∈ Rmn×mn where
Ak ∈ R
n×n
.
2) (µk(x) ⊗ In)(µl(x) ⊗ In) = (µk(x)µl(x) ⊗ In) ∈
R
mn×mn.
3) ∑Lk=1 µk(x) = Imn and ∑Lk=1∑Ll=1(µk(x)µl(x)) =
Imn.
Proof: The properties 1) and 2) are fundamental for
Kronecker product [23]. The property 3) can be proven
via the fuzzy fundamental property,
∑L
k=1 µk(xi) = 1 for
i = 1, · · · ,m.
By the properties of µk(x), the total fuzzy stochastic time-
delayed coupled networks for i = 1, . . . ,m in (15) could be
represented as follows

scribed level by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI).
Moreover, instead of solving the HJI directly, the multiple
fuzzy models are proposed to approximate the nonlinear
stochastic time-delayed coupled networks and attain the H∞
robust synchronization performance by solving a set of equiv-
alent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A coupled Brusselator
systems synchronized design has been provided to illustrate
the practical application of the robust H∞ synchronization
scheme to complex coupled chemical reaction networks.

II. METHODS
A. Generalized model 
First, an example of biological neuron systems is used to 
demonstrate how our proposed method works. Here, three 
dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose model was adopted as an 
example of neural dynamic system in fig.1. This model was 
proposed by Hindmarsh and Rose in 1984 upon the 
FitzHugh-Nagumo model [11]. This model describes neuronal 
activity by three coupled first order nonlinear ordinary 
differential equations:

dy c dx y
dt
dz r s x x z
dt
Y S    
  
  
  (1) 
where x is a voltage associated with the membrane potential, y
is in principle associated with a recovery current of fast ions, 
and z is a slow adaptation current associated with slow ions. I is 
the upstream current input. The time variable of the model is 
dimensionless. For the numerical results of this work we fix the 
usual parameters to the values a=1(mV)-2, b=3.0(mV)-1,
c=1.0mV, d=5.0(mV)-1, s=4.0ȝS, x0=-1.6mV, r=0.006, ȟ=1Mȍ,
and ȡ=1Mȍ. These numerical values have been frequently 
used [12]. 
By rearranging these three equations, (1) can be rewritten 
into a matrix form:

  (2) 
where x=[x y z]١ is the state variable vector, f: Թ3ėԹ3 is 
interaction function, g: Թ3ėԹ1 is input coupling function, and 
u(=I) is the input current. Moreover, the output signal of a 
neuron is the membrane potential, x. In general, the generalized 
neuron dynamic system can be represented in the following 
form:

where x=[x1 ڮ xn]١ is the state variable vector in Թn, f: ԹnėԹn
is interaction function, g: ԹmėԹn is input coupling function, u
is the input vector in Թm, and CאԹk×n is a transformation that 
transforms the state variable vector x into some output we want 
to study. For example, in Hindmarsh-Rose model, we want to 
study how a neuron affects the output, i.e., the membrane 
potential x, then C=[1 0 0].

B. Transmission ability 
Based on the system gain viewpoint [13], the transmission 
ability is defined as follows:

 (4) 
where u and y are the input and output signals of neuron, 
respectively. Note that L2 denotes the set of all possible 
bounded input signals within the time intervalʳ[0,tf]. Since there 
are many kinds of bounded upstream input signals into a 
neuron, the transmission ability is defined as the least upper 
bound of all possible output/input energy ratios, i.e., the system 
gain from input u to output y from the system theory point of 
view. The physical meaning of the transmission ability ȡa is the 
extent of input signal can be enhanced or attenuated by the 
neuron system we discussed. In particular, we can say that the 
transmission ability of a neuron determines how neuron 
processes input signals from the upstream neurons. According 
to this definition, to get the transmission ability ȡa, an 
optimization problem needs to be solved. Unfortunately, this 
cannot be solved directly. So we transform it into a suboptimal 
problem as described in the following. First, we denote ȡ is the 
upper bound of transmission ability ȡa. Then, we have:

Since ȡ is the upper bound of the transmission ability ȡa, we 
can find the transmission ability ȡa by minimizing its upper 
bound ȡ. So we have the following result: 
Proposition 1. For the generalized neuron system in (3), if 
there exists a positive function V(x) with V(0) = 0 satisfying the 
following Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI):

then the information transmission ability of the nonlinear 
neuron system in (3) is less than or equal to ȡ.

the fuzzy bases, other interpolation bases could also be 
employed to interpolate several linear neuron systems to

IV. DISSCUSSION
In this study, the information transmission ability of a 
neuron is investigated from a systematic viewpoint, which is 
different from the aspect of information theory. It is a new 
attempt to access the mechanism of information processing in a 
neuron. According to the concept of a system gain from system 
input to system output, our proposed method can calculate the 
information transmission ability of neuron and is only 
dependent on the structure of the neuron and the ion channels 
involved in. That can be also seen by observing (9) or (17), the 
value of ȡa is dependent on the system characteristic functions 
or matrices.  However, for a more precise estimation of the 
information transmission ability, it needs to be confirmed by 
biological experiments. The dynamic models for neuron can be 
improved according to the improvement on the experimental 
techniques and the knowledge about dynamics of neuron. 
Nevertheless, based on our purposed measurement, the 
information transmission ability can always be accessed no 
matter which model is used to describe the neuron, i.e., our 
measurement method for information transmission ability is 
suitable for different neuron system. 
In reality, the neurons operated in a living system always 
have inherent noise due to random events. The amount of noise 
is a property of the system itself, and it may or may not cause 
significant deviation from the deterministic model. Some 
stochastic models have been developed due to the 
consideration of the nature of the neuron, that is, neurons 
execute their functions under external disturbances and internal 
noises [5, 18]. One way to improve the measurement is to 
modify our proposed method with noise term v(t), i.e.,

Abstract—Information processing is an important characteristic 
of biological neurons. Here, we proposed a method to measure 
the information transmission ability of neurons. Due to the 
nonlinear dynamics of neuron, which is experimentally verified, 
we have to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities (HJIs) to get 
the information transmission ability of neuron. Instead of 
directly solving HJIs, fuzzy interpolation method was employed 
to help us to systematically measure information transmission 
ability by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The 
information transmission ability measurement method will 
provide an insight into the mechanism of information processing 
in neurons. 
Keywords- Information transmission ability, Hindmarsh-Rose 
model, fuzzy interpolation, T-S fuzzy model, linear matrix 
inequalities (LMIs) 
I. INTRODUCTION
The human brain is one of the most mysterious machines in 
the world, which can process outside information and generate 
responses accordingly. Plenty of scientists have been devoted 
in the neuron research. They all want to figure out how neurons 
work in brain. In computational neuroscience, there are many 
neuron models provided an opportunity to analyze a neuron in 
mathematics sense and then to explain the behavior of a neuron 
[1]. Although there are many dynamic properties of a neuron 
have been investigated such as bifurcation, synchronization, 
etc.[2], a well explanation about how brain execute function is 
still absent. At higher level, contrast to neuron level, 
researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), etc. to study the 
human brain. Some specific brain areas have been identified to 
be responsible for specific functions, such as speaking, angry, 
etc. [3]. However, this macroscopic view doesn’t explain how 
human brain conducts functions in details, that is, how neurons 
give rise to those brain functions. 
Recently, there are many papers discussed how neurons 
process noises, which is recognized as an important property of 
neurons since, as we known; neurons execute their function 
under a noisy environment [4]. In [5], the authors focused on 
how neurons process two kinds of noises, channel and current 
noises. They defined a so-called noise-enhancing factor to 
quantify how these noises affect neurons. In addition to noise 
processing, a more important and interesting problem is how 
upstream information is processed in neurons. In order to 
understand how upstream information is processed in neurons, 
we tried to propose a measurement to quantify how neurons 
transmit upstream information. 
Nowadays, most of studies on the information processing 
of neurons may be divided into two categories. First, the brain 
structures are used to explain the information processing 
mechanism. For example, sensory information received by the 
olfactory bulb may be processed and refined prior to 
transmission to the olfactory cortex via intrabulbar circuits 
involving two classes of interneurons, the periglomerular cells 
and the granule cells [6]. Second, the information theory is 
used to explore the information encoding in neurons. Some 
working hypotheses based on the evidence from the application 
of information theoretic and related approaches to how 
information is encoded in the visual, hippocampal, and 
olfactory cortical systems also are proposed and waited to be 
experimental verified [7]. However, there is a gap between 
these two viewpoints. Hence, we provide a new way from the 
systematic viewpoint to investigate the information processing 
in neurons 
The proposed measurement scheme for information 
transmission ability of nonlinear neuron systems needs to solve 
a corresponding nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI). At 
present, except for some simple cases, there is no analytic or 
numerical solution for HJI. Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems 
have efficiently interpolated several local linear systems via a 
set of fuzzy bases to approximate a nonlinear system, enabling 
the HJI in a nonlinear information transmission ability 
measurement problem to be replaced by a set of linear matrix 
inequalities (LMIs) [8-10]. This then allows the nonlinear 
information transmission ability measurement problem to be 
transformed into an equivalent LMIs-constrained optimization 
problem, which is more easily to solve with the help of LMI 
toolbox in MATLAB. Because the information transmission 
ability measurement method is based on fuzzy system theory 
for signal transmission systems, the transmission ability of 
nonlinear neuron models is able to be investigated from these 
fuzzy-interpolated local linear neuron models. Using this 
method, a more biological insight into information 
transmission ability of neurons in brain can be investigated 
from the linear system viewpoint.

If the transmission ability ȡa is small, the last term in (9) is 
positively large. In this situation, the first term (V(x)/x)١f(x)
should be more negative (more stable) so that the HJI in (7) 
still holds. On the other hand, if (V(x)/x)١f(x) is less negative 
(less stable), then the information transmission ability ȡa should 
be large enough to satisfy the HJI in (9). From the HJI in (9), it 
can be seen that the signal transduction ability is more closely 
related to the system characteristics f(x), g(x), and C of a 
neuron than the external stimuli. This is a similar case to a 
low-pass filter having greater dependence on the system 
characteristic of the filter than the incoming noise. 
In general, it is still very difficult to solve the nonlinear 
HJI-constrained optimization problem for the measurement of 
transmission ability described in (8). Thus, a fuzzy 
interpolation method is employed to overcome the nonlinear 
difficulties associated with solving the HJI problem in (7) and 
to simplify the constrained optimization procedures required to 
solve the transmission ability problem in (8). 
C. Fuzzification 
Fuzzy dynamic modeling has been widely employed to 
approximate nonlinear dynamic systems and to simplify 
nonlinear control problems by interpolating several local 
linear dynamic systems [8, 9]. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy 
dynamic model [10] is described by fuzzy “If-Then” rules and 
employed here to help solving the transmission ability 
measurement problem for the signaling pathway. The i-th rule 
of the fuzzy model for the nonlinear neuron model in (3) is 
proposed as follows [8, 9]:

 (10) 
where i=1,2,ڮ,L. xi(t) is the premise variable, Fij is the fuzzy 
set, Ai and Bi are the local system matrices, L is the number of 
fuzzy rules, and l is the number of premise variables. If all 
state variables are used as premise variables then l=n. The 
physical meaning of fuzzy rule i in (10) is that if the state 
variables x1(t), x2(t), ڮ, xl(t) are with the local fuzzy sets Fi1,
Fi2, ڮ, Fil, then the nonlinear neuron model in (3) could be 
15
Using the fuzzy approximation method, the HJI in (7) is 
interpolated by a set of Riccati-like algebraic inequalities in 
(13) or (14). Therefore, the transmission ability of the 
nonlinear neuron model could be obtained by solving the 
following LMIs-constrained optimization problem: 
0

 (16) 
which can then be solved by decreasing ȡ until no positive 
definite symmetric matrix Q is able to satisfy the inequalities 
in (14) or (15). 
Remark 1. The Riccati-like inequalities in (13) or (14) are an 
approximation of HJI with L local linear systems. Similarly, 
the LMIs-constrained optimization problem in (16), describing 
the transmission ability measurement of a nonlinear neuron 
system, is also an efficient approach based on a fuzzy 
interpolation method to replace the very difficult 
HJI-constrained optimization problem in (8). The 
LMIs-constrained optimization problem for the transmission 
ability measurement is known as an “eigenvalue problemϙ,
which can be efficiently solved by the LMI toolbox in 
MATLAB.

If ȡa is smaller, the last term will be larger so that the 
eigenvalues of Ai would be in the far left hand complex plane 
(i.e., with more negative real part or more stable) and (17) 
would hold. If ȡa is larger, the last term in (17) will be smaller, 
meaning that the eigenvalues of Ai would be closer to the 
imaginary axis (i.e., with smaller negative real part or less 
stable). In general, neurons amplify the input signals (i.e., 
ȡa>1). In this situation, the eigenvalues of Ai would approach 
the imaginary axis (less stable) in order to amplify the input 
signals. The information transmission ability of the neuron 
system is more dependent on the system characteristics Ai, Bi,
and C than on the upstream signal u(t), just as a low-pass filter 
is more dependent on the low-pass characteristic (poles and 
zeros) of the system than on the filtered noise. 
III. SIMULATION EXAMPLE
The Hindmarsh-Rose neuron system in (1) is used to 
demonstrate the procedure of our proposed measurement of the 
information transmission ability of neuron system. This neuron 
system was proposed to model the neurons in the mammalian 
thalamus whose function includes relaying sensory and motor 
signals to the cerebral cortex, along with the regulation of 
consciousness, sleep, and alertness [3]. The Hindmarsh-Rose 
model is widely used in the study of neuron dynamics because 
it can produce several modes of spiking-bursting activity, 
including a regime of chaos, that appear similar to those seen in 
biological neurons [15]. This model has the following 
properties: (i) a short suprathreshold current pulse switches the 
system from a silent state to a bursting state, or to give a single 
burst, (ii) a subthreshold depolarizing current step gives a 
passive response at rest, but if the system is either constantly 
hyperpolarized or constantly depolarized then the same current 
gives different active responses, (iii) hyperpolarization from 
rest is followed by post-inhibitory rebound, and (iv) the neuron 
responds in an unique and characteristic way to an applied 
current ramp, which are very similar to those that have been 
recorded intracellularly from neurons in the mammalian 
thalamus [16, 17]. In [15], the author also pointed out that the 
Hindmarsh-Rose neuron system in (1) can, in principle, exhibit 
all of the neuro-computational properties. 
The parameters of this neuron system we used are given. 
The simulation procedure was initiated by selecting a T-S 
fuzzy system to approximate the nonlinear neuron system. The 
parameters of the fuzzy system, Ai and Bi in (10) or (11) can be 
found by the least mean square parameter estimation algorithm 
based on methods of system identification [10]. The LMIs in 
(15) can then be solved via the LMI toolbox in MATLAB. 
Finally, the information transmission ability in (16) can be 
obtained by solving the LMIs-constrained problem through 
decreasing ȡ until no positive definite symmetric matrix Q is 
able to satisfy (15). 
Using the least mean square parameter estimation, the 
parameters Ai and Bi of the fuzzy model can be identified to 
achieve the minimum square error. Since there are 3 state 
variables in the model, and 5 fuzzy sets for each state variable, 
a total of 125 fuzzy rules are applied to the fuzzy model. The 
dynamics of nonlinear neuron system and fuzzy neuron system 
are shown in fig.2 and fig.3, respectively. Obviously, the fuzzy 
neuron system can approximate the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron 
system precisely. 
In the end, by solving the eigenvalue problem with LMI 
toolbox in MATLAB, the information transmission ability of 
the fuzzy Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model is 124.5480 and the 
corresponding positive definite symmetric matrix is

matched the food production [1]. At the same time, climate change will cause extreme 
variation in weather and further exacerbate constraint on food production [2, 3]. 
Therefore, rice quantity and quality must be improved to face the global 
environmental change. Theoretical model demonstrate that rice production needs to 
match the rate of projected population growth. It can be only achieved by increasing 
the efficiency of photosynthesis [1, 4]. The efficiency of radiation use in C3 and C4 
plant differ by about 50% [5]. Moreover, C4 crop such as maize have higher yields 
than C3 crop and have high tolerance of growth in hot and dry environments [6, 7]. 
Therefore, engineering the C4 photosynthetic pathway into rice is proposed as a 
solution to dramatically increase rice production [8, 9] and to face the future warmer 
climate [10].  
 C4 photosynthesis is a coordination of biochemical, anatomical, and gene 
regulatory characteristics. Significant amount of research have summarized a number 
of excellent reviews about this unique mechanism [11-13]. In comparison to C3 plants, 
biochemically, C4 photosynthetic pathway has a pump that concentrates CO2 at the 
site of Rubisco in the bundle sheath cell [14]. Such a CO2 concentrating mechanism 
decreases relative O2 concentration around the Rubisco and correspondingly reduces 
photorespiration. As a consequence of this mechanism Rubisco can achieves its 
maximal catalytic activity, which largely improves the photosynthetic efficiency. 
Such a CO2 concentrating mechanism depends on the coordination between two 
specialized cell types, the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells, which compartmenting 
photosynthetic enzymes and metabolite transporter of the photosynthetic carbon 
assimilation pathway. Besides, C4 plant also evolved an efficient metabolite 
transportation system between two cell types[15]. Anatomically, although leaf 
architecture may vary in various C4 plants, a so-called kranz anatomy is typical 
structure for all C4 plants. Although the evolutionary transition from C3 to C4 
photosynthesis involved massive quantitative and qualitative change in gene 
expression, the polyphyletic evolution of the C4 pathway suggests the transition is 
relative simple. Besides, all enzymes involved in the C4 photosynthesis pathway have 
counterparts in C3 plants, which suggests both C3 and C4 plants posses inherent 
plasticity [7], and the specialized anatomy of C4 leaves appears to rely on spatial and 
quantitative anatomical and developmental variations in the feature that already exist 
in C3 plants [16-19]. These evidences above provide the challenge that engineering 
C4 photosynthetic pathway to C3 rice for optimism. 
In order to build a two-celled C4 photosynthetic pathway in C3 rice leave, we 
have to understand the mechanistic interface between leaf morphology and 
photosynthetic metabolism in C3 and C4 leave [7]. Several researches devoted to 
investigate that in species with altered leaf anatomy results in changes in leaf

The proposed method of constructing gene regulatory network can be divided two 
steps: (i) constructing a rough gene regulatory networks. (ii) pruning the rough gene 
regulatory network via dynamic model. 
 
Constructing a rough gene regulatory network 
 We extracted all transcription factors in maize from Plant Transcription Factor 
Database. We computed the Pearson correlation between each TF profile and gene 
profile via time series microarray data, and then found that if p-value≤0.001, the 
relationship of a TF-gene pair is of high confident could be regarded as a potentially 
regulatory interaction.  
 To reconstruct rough gene regulatory network, we must determine the target 
genes potentially related to C4 photosynthetic pathway or the kranz anatomy. 
Functionally, we included the genes involved in photosynthesis, development, leaf 
morphology, cell organization, and cell division from Gene Ontology (GO) database 
and The Plant Proteome Database (PPDB). According to the potential regulatory 
interactions, we are able to find candidate transcriptional factors that potentially 
regulate target gene. These candidate TFs that not present in the target gene pool will 
be added to it to find their potential regulator iteratively, and the iterative procedure 
will be discontinued when no more new candidate TFs are extracted from potentially 
regulatory interactions. Finally these target genes pool and potentially regulatory 
interactions constitute a rough gene regulatory network.  
 
Pruning the rough gene regulatory network via dynamic model 
 From the First step above, we have constructed a rough gene regulatory network 
using Pearson’s statistical inferences, and it should contain some false positive 
TF-gene interactions. A stochastic dynamic model was then applied to prune the 
rough gene regulatory network to obtain independently for early leaf development and 
late leaf development, according to their respective time stage of microarray data.  
The dynamic gene regulation model is used to consider the transcriptional 
regulatory mechanism as a system with several regulatory genes as transcriptionary 
regulation input and a target gene’s expression as an output. For a target gene i in the 
rough gene regulatory network the gene was described using the stochastic discrete 
dynamic equation (1) 
1
( 1) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )iNi i ij j i i ijx t x t b z t x t t kb ε=+ = + − + +∑  (1) 
where ( )ix t represents the i-th target gene expression level at time t, and ( )ijb t  
denotes the regulatory ability of the j-th TF toward the i-th target gene with a positive 
6 
 
generated by the above-mentioned procedure. As overall flowchart of the proposed 
method is shown in Figure 1.Details of system identification methods are in the 
Materials and Methods section.  
Result 
Based in step 1, we can construct a rough gene regulatory network of maize leaf 
development. Then the time series microarray data is divided into two stages, early 
stage of leaf development and late stage of leaf development. By combining the 
constrained least squares and parsimonious AIC method, the rough gene network is 
pruned via two stages time series microarray data. We finally constructed two refined 
gene regulatory networks at early stage of leaf development and late stage of leaf 
development respectively. 
Once we have successfully constructed the refined networks under two 
developmental stages. We summarize the connection degree of each node existing in 
two different conditions. The highly connected hubs at different developmental stages 
are shown in table 1. In order to capture more significant difference between two 
developmental stages, we compared the network under early stage of leaf 
development with the network under late stage of leaf development. Through the 
same interactions found in both developmental stages, we can extract the specific 
connections only present in early stage of leaf development (late stage of leaf 
development) but not in other condition. Such differential gene regulatory network 
could be considered as gain-of-function under specific condition and provided a better 
understanding of which regulatory interaction has a significant effect on leaf 
development. The highly connected hubs in two differential networks are shown in 
table 2. 
Conclusion 
 Engineering C4 photosynthetic pathway into C3 rice has potential to 
dramatically increase the yield of major C3 rice. However, little is known about the 
formation of C4 leaf in molecular level. In this study, several transcription factors are 
identified via systematic approaches. These TFs play an important role in different 
developmental stages and have significant effects on the formation of C4 leaf.

Introduction 
  
 The regenerative capacity of the mammalian adult heart is limited. A massive 
loss of cardiac muscle occurs after myocardial infarction (MI); this overloads the 
surviving myocardium and ultimately leads to heart failure [1]. A fundamental goal of 
regenerative cardiovascular medicine is to successfully repair injured hearts by 
replacing cardiomyocytes and decreasing fibrosis. Recent studies suggest that the 
adult murine heart also contains such a progenitor cell population and potentially is 
capable of limited regeneration [2-4]. In addition, Zebraﬁsh display an extensive 
regenerative capacity, as they are able to restore completely lost cardiac tissue after 
partial ventricular amputation. The zebrafish is emerging as a very valuable tool to 
understand heart regeneration and to devise strategies that may be of potential value 
to treat human cardiac disease [5]. Analysis of these cardiac progenitor cell 
populations and the ﬁbroproliferative response following a myocardial injury remains 
an area of intense interest and investigation. 
Recent studies suggest that other tissues in the adult MRL mouse maybe capable 
of regeneration including the heart, brain and spinal cord. R. Haris Naseem et al 
undertook a series of superficial and transmural myocardial injuries to evaluate the 
regenerative response in the C57BL/6 (B6) and MRL adult heart. They found that the 
MRL mouse has improved survival following a severe transmural myocardial injury 
compared to C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we want to find the significant regeneration 
proteins in MRL mouse by molecular mechanism. In addition, zebrafish is also 
capable of regenerating multiple complex body structures, including the fin and heart 
[6]. We investigated what the significant regeneration proteins both exist in mouse 
and zebrafish. This analysis may improve the understanding of the regeneration 
mechanism underlying heart regeneration. 
 
Method 
 
Overview of the network-based biomarker approach for heart regeneration 
investigation 
 The method of the global screening for heart regeneration-related proteins was 
divided into three key steps: (i) data selection and processing for proteins, (ii) 
constructing C57BL6/J and MRL protein association networks and calculating RRV, 
(iii) comparing with the expression data and protein association network of zebrafish.

association network by microarray data through dynamic protein interaction model. 
 For a target protein i in the candidate protein association network with N proteins, 
the simple linear regression model of the protein activity is as follows (1)

where yi[n] represents the protein expression level of the target protein i for the 
sample n, αij denotes the association ability of the j-th protein toward the i-th target 
protein, yj[n] represents the protein expression level of the j-th protein that interacts 
with the target protein i for the sample n, Ni denotes the number of proteins interact 
with the target protein i, εi[n] represents the stochastic noises due to other factors and 
model uncertainty. 
We utilized Maximum likelihood estimation to identify the associated parameters. 
Since the number of interactions in rough protein association network is obtained by 
literature at different biological situations or conditions, several of interactions may 
not exist in our case. Therefore these estimated interaction parameters should be 
pruned by the model order selection method Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The 
AIC, which attempts to include both the estimated residual error and model 
complexity in one statistics, decreases as the residual variance decreases and increases 
as the number of interactions (complexity) increases.

Conclusion 
  
 In this study, we constructed C57BL6/J protein association network and MRL 
protein association network and identified the significant proteins in heart 
regeneration of mouse by RRV. In addition, we constructed the heart regeneration 
protein network of zebrafish. According this network and RRV table we could find 
several proteins such as nr0b1 and src, etc. may play the important roles in heart 
regeneration of zebrafish. We also discovered some potential proteins of heart 
regeneration by microarray expression data of zebrafish. In future, we will confirm 
that whether this potential proteins can influence the heart regenerative ability of 
zebrafish by biological experiments.
