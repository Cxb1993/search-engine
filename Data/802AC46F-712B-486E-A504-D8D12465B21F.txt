1. Introduction 
Granular flows frequently occur in natural fields and engineering applications, including 
rock avalanches, debris flows, pyroclastic flows, the breaking of retaining walls or silos, and 
industrial granular transport. Granular matter exhibits the multiphase properties of solids, 
liquids and gases under various external conditions. In most cases, the static properties and 
dynamic characteristics of granular matter are closely related to the natural process and 
artificial actions. The avalanching process consists of both the increasing and the decreasing 
phases in rectangle granular piles [1]. Both the flow velocity and the flow depth increase 
rapidly to a maximum in the initial stage of an avalanche, slowly decaying thereafter. The 
final angle of a granular pile approaches the angle of repose. In the initial stage, the falling 
process is independent of both the type of granular matter and the sidewall friction, according 
to experimental results and numerical simulations [2-8]. With respect to the collapse process, 
Lube et al. (2007)[9] proposed that both the final avalanching time tf and the height h∞ are 
independent of the granular material and the roughness of the bottom of the chute. Based on 
experimental observations, the collapse of a granular column proceeds through three stages: 
the first collapse stage involves free-fall behavior, which is solely controlled by gravity. The 
second stage is characterized by lateral motion until the interface between the static and 
dynamic regimes reaches the free surface. The sidewall effect is negligible in the first two 
stages. However, the effect of friction between particles and side walls plays a predominant 
role in the final stage, in which the flow layer is thinner than in the other stages and the 
avalanching process is slower. 
A stony debris avalanche typically occurs on a steep slope with exposed regolith. The 
failure is composed of two processes - the fast avalanching and the relatively slow surface 
flow with slope relaxation. The entire process has a short duration, and it involves 
 5 
 
and (3) polystyrene beads (d=5.8±0.1 mm, φ=20.8o). The angles of repose of these materials 
were measured three times by discharging the material vertically from a hopper onto a wider 
transparent cylinder (D=12cm). Images of the final static deposition angles were then obtained 
by using package ImageJ (available from HUhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/UH) in four radial directions 
and the average value was taken. The friction coefficient between granular particles and the 
sidewall was determined by performing an adjustable inclined plate test. A high-speed CCD 
camera (IDT XS-3) with a sampling rate of 200 fps is installed above the side wall of the 
chute. The capture region is illuminated by two continuous halogen lamps at both the 
upstream and downstream ends. In each run, all processes are recorded from the gate opening 
to the end of the avalanches. Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) based on the Voronoi cell 
method [10] and particle image velocimetry (UraPIV, available from 
http://urapiv.wordpress.com/) are utilized to make velocity measurements with high spatial 
and temporal resolutions. The viewing window of the cross-sectional CCD camera is set to 
capture a region of interest of around 50 cm x 50 cm, which contains 1350 squared pixels 
(1cm ≈ 27 pixel widths). Fig. 2 schematically depicts the experimental setup. The bed slope of 
the chute θ is adjusted from 0o to 10o, and the initial height of each granular pile hi= 10 cm.  
Li and Lf represent the initial and final upper surface lengths, respectively. At any elapsed time 
t, the distance between the brink (nick point) and the final static region (Lf) along the upper 
surface is given by L.

 Avalanching behaviors are captured from ten successive long-exposure images (Figs.4 
(a)~(d)). The initial solid sliding (t<τc) phase is independent the change in the bed slope (Figs. 
4 (a)~(b)), but the increase in the bed slope considerably enhances the retreating rate of the 
upper surface in the surface flow phase (t>>τc), as shown in Figs. 4 (c) and (d). The flowing 
thickness also increases with the bed slope in the surface flow stage. The observed sliding 
failure surface is consistent with the well-known Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion so the 
critical angle of inclination, fθ , between the slip surface and the bed plane in the active state  
is

opened, the granular assembly is in Rankine’s active state. Most particle trajectories above the 
sliding failure surface are parallel to the slip surface, as presented in Fig. 5(a).  Subsequently 
in the surface flow phase (t>τc), a series of saltations above the granular surface are observed,

The experimental results obtained with various slopes for plastic beads, mill stone,

experimental results from other studies and the present investigation. For a particular width, 
the surface slope is inversely proportional to particle size for both spherical and irregular 
particles. The effect of the side walls on the surface angle is proposed as

where α2 is a fitting constant (=0.345 for all materials).  For an extremely narrow channel, θs 
may reach twice angle of repose φ(W~0, θs~2φ). For a wide channel, θs approximates φ  (W~
∞, θs~φ).  The effect of the side wall friction on the inclined surface angle should be taken 
into account as long as W/d < 20, as depicted in Fig. 8.  The experimental data indicate that 
the correlation between κ and d is insignificant. The value of κ is not only controlled by 
particle size but it is also affected by wall friction and the coefficient of restitution.  Further 
studies on this issue are required.

Fig. 9 Profiles of the initial solid volume fraction Ci and the flow-induced volume fraction 
change ΔC for mill stone (d=3.5mm) with W=5 cm: (a) θ=0o, (b) θ=5o, (c) θ=10o. The 
flow-induced solid volume fraction change is defined as ΔC=Ci-Cs (Ci : initial solid volume 
fraction denoted by gray dashed lines;  Cs : the instant flow-induced  solid volume fraction). 
The evolution of both surface velocity and the thickness of the flowing layer, 
respectively, at the midpoint along the inclined surface are shown in Figs. 10 (a) and (b). The 
experimental results of Siavoshi et al. (2005) are also included for comparison [1]. These 
curves demonstrate that both surface velocity and flow thickness reach their peaks at around 
t=τc, in the initial collapsing stage (t*<0.1; where the definition of t* is given by Eq(6)). The 
appearance of maximum velocity at t=τc reveals that the sidewall effect in the initial free-fall 
stage is negligible. The dimensionless flowing thickness decreases as the granular size 
increases, and it increases slightly as the angle of the bed slope increases.

all experiments are 4±1 (glass beads, d=2 mm), 3±0.5 (mill stone, d=3.5 mm), 2±0.3 
(polystyrene beads, d=5.8 mm) and 3±1 (sand, d=2 mm), respectively. Komastu et al. (2001) 
found that the characteristic length scale of the exponential velocity profile for the creep 
motion is approximately the granular size [23]. Fig. 12 compares the characteristic lengths λ/d 
for instantaneous avalanches in rotating drums and chute experiments [24-26]. Although the 
fluctuation increases, λ/d tends to decrease as the particle size d increases. The values of λ/d 
obtained from the chute experiments exceed those in the rotating drums for the same particle 
size. Notably, the particle with a higher coefficient of restitution exhibits greater mobility. 
Therefore, the λ/d ratio for the glass bead is larger than that of sand at the same diameter (d=2 
mm).

  As plotted in Fig. 10, the dimensionless velocities gdv /  at given time t* increase 
continuously with the bed slope but decrease as the particle size increases. The transient 
velocity profiles always decrease with time in the surface flow regime. The shear rate γ&  in 
the upper flowing layer for glass beads, being obtained from Fig. 11(a), is approximately 
dg /38.0  (Midi(2004) reported the value of shear rate for the steady granular flow is 
around dg /5.0 )[15]. Other profiles (Figs.11 (b)~(d)) exhibit a decay trend in shear rate 
which is affected by the bed slope and time duration. The shear rate of unsteady granular 
flows changes slightly with time and it resembles surface flows in a narrow channel [8]. The 
well-known power-law velocity profile is also applicable to steady, uniform chute flows  as  
follows

Q/(gd3)0.5 evolves spontaneously toward decreasing linearly in all experimental runs are 
shown in Fig. 15, and the jammed flowing depth, hjam, is 4.4 d, being less than that in previous 
study [27].  This result may come from differences in both the flowing regimes and the 
configurations.  As shown in Figs. 14 and 15, the velocity profiles in unsteady, narrow 
granular flows are not consistent with the Bagnold profiles. In our experimental configuration, 
the thickness of the quasi-static region always exceeds that of the flowing layer, even in the 
final stage. Moreover, the sidewall effect and a thin flowing layer immediately above the thick 
quasi-static bottom may also promote SSH rheology.

rate at the bottom of the slope is determined by integrating the velocity profile there.  Fig. 
17(a) depicts the histogram of the scaled flow rate Qout/(gd3)0.5. The effects of the material 
property (size, surface friction) and bed slope is noted mainly when t*<0.6. All experimental 
runs show that Qout is close to zero because the flowing layer is shallow after t*>0.6. 
Experimental observations reveal that the flowing phenomenon has three stages - (1) solid 
sliding (t*<0.06), when both Q and h increase rapidly and approach their peaks; (2) a 
transition of the granular material (t*=0.06~0.2) from the solid to the fluid phase, and  (3) 
surface flow (t*>0.2), in which  both U and H decrease gradually with time. All data are 
reasonably fitted by the following regression

where σ and β are material parameters.  There are two distinct types of curves as  shown in 
Fig. 17(a). The material with higher e (glass beads, dashed curve; σ=690, β=-12.5) has a 
higher flow rate than the material with a lower e (solid curve; σ=643, β=-16). The borderline 
between the first and second stages can generally be identified by using β/1max =tQ . 
Granular materials with smooth surfaces and larger coefficient of restitution, such as 
glass beads, are expected to have higher mobility.  As shown in Fig. 17(b), the flow rate, 
Q/(gd3)0.5 at the midpoint of the inclined free surface is evaluated by using Eq.(11).  A 
comparison with Qout/(gd3)0.5 (Fig. 17(a)) demonstrates that the flow rate Q/(gd3)0.5 is slightly 
lower than the outflow rate at the toe when t*<0.2 but slightly higher for 0.2< t*<0.6. The 
discrepancy between the flow rates is negligible when t*>0.6, except for the glass beads (d=2 
mm). The flow patterns associated with the collapsing process are thus neither steady nor 
uniform. The variations in the flow depth are shown in Figs. 18(a)-(c). Sudden sliding causes 
the flow depth at the downstream outlet to exceed that at the midpoint of the inclined surface 
in the initial sliding phase (hout>h, Fig.18(a)). The discharge at the outlet is greater than the

4. Conclusions 
The study investigates the dynamic characteristics and collapsing process of a granular 
step on horizontal and inclined slopes. The proposed conceptual model of the retreating upper 
surface agrees reasonably with all of the experimental results with a universal sliding time 
scale, 07.0)/( ≈+= faa tttK .  With respect to the final deposition angle and the coefficient κ 
that specifies the side-wall effect is not sensitive to the particle size d. A regressive equation 
that describes the sidewall effect is proposed for 3<W/d<50. Transient velocity profiles 
measured from the side wall are characterized by temporal self-similarity at various times. 
Due to wall friction, the velocity profile in the flowing layer can be fitted by either an 
exponential distribution or the power-law distribution instead of being the Bagnold velocity 
profile.  The characteristic velocity  dU /  and the characteristic flow depth dH /  for the 
transient flow are linearly correlated. The evolution of flow rates for the falling process of a 
rectangular granular step has three stages with quantification of the elapsed time, t* - (1) 
initial solid sliding (t~τc, or t*<0.06), (2) transition (0.06<t*<0.2), and (3) shallow surface 
flow (0.2<t*<1).
