ψTVm is the interference temperature limit at the

III. THE JOINT LINK SCHEDULING AND POWER
CONTROL
In this section, we propose a joint link schedul-
ing and power control scheme to improve network
throughput and energy efficiency under the power
control condition. First, we assume a centralized
controller to manage all links in the cognitive ra-
dio network. Furthermore, we assume that the lth
transmission case Cl =
[
c(l,1), c(l,2), . . . , c(l,N)
]
, l =
1, . . . , 2N is the on-off activity of the link transmis-
sion mode, then
c(l,i) =
{
1,link i is active for the lth transmission case
0, link i is not active
(6)
Note that there are 2N possible transmission cases
with a complexity growing exponentially with the
number of link N . We would find the best trans-
mission case inwhich each active link satisfies the
QoS of the secondary receiver. We assume prop-
agation model to experience path loss only. The
path loss exponent of TV transmitter and secondary
transmitter are α1 and α2, respectively. We assume
that the link gain gi,TV is from the TV station to
the ith secondary receiver and the link gain gi,j
is from the jth secondary transmitter to the ith
secondary receiver. Then the received SINR of the
ith secondary receiver with the lth transmission case
can be written as
γsec(l,i) =
c(l,i)g(i,i)P
sec
(l,i)
N∑
j=1,j 6=i
c(l,j)g(i,j)P
sec
(l,j) + g(i,TV )PTV +N0
(7)
where N0 is the noise power of secondary receiver.
Following the power control condition of (4) and
(7), we use distributed power control scheme to
find the transmission power of each link. Then the
transmission power P sec(l,i) must be limited by (5).
According to [4], we prevent transmission power
from exceeded the interference temperature limit
at the primary receiver. From (3), the transmitted
power of secondary user must be constrained in
P sec(l,i) ≤
ψTVm
gTV,iS
(8)
where S is the number of active link from the
transmission cases. If the transmitted power of
secondary user satisfies (8), the interference from
secondary transmitter would not exceed interference
temperature limit at the primary receiver. For the
ith secondary transmitter, the iterative power control
scheme is written as
P sec(l,i) (t+ 1) = min
{
P sec(l,i) (t) ,min
(
P secmax,
ψTVm
gTV,iS
)}
(9)
Then our proposed joint link scheduling and
power control algorithm is presented below.

transmitter-receiver pairs.
