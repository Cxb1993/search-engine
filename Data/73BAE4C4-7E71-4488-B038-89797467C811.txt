一、 前言 
  近年來由於經濟的發展以及人口
的增加對於能源的需求大量的增加，
使得化石燃料的使用更加的頻繁，燃
燒化石燃料會造成環境的污染、氣候
的變遷，而且它屬於有限的資源[1-3]。
嚴重的環境汙染問題和初級能源價格
的攀升，使得世界各地對再生能源的
技術更加的重視[4-7]。而這些新能源
的技術要能馬上達到符合經濟效益是
有困難的[8-10]，許多研究專家建議需
要找到更好的能源轉換方法和效率才
能有效的利用能源[11]。在 2005 年 2
月京都議定書生效後，尋找高效率、
乾淨的新能源也成為世界之重要任務。
氫能使用時具有零排放特性，能源密
集度高，加上氫燃料取得的方式多元，
將成為未來世界主流的能源載體
(Energy Carrier)、取代化石燃料的市
場潛力相當大[12，13]。燃料電池以氫
氣和氧氣為主要的反應氣體，氫氣的
能量密度高、污染低、取得方便、應
用市場廣泛，因此發展以氫能為主的
能源科技是十分有利的，其發電原理
乃藉由電化學反應發電，不經過熱機
之燃燒過程，在能源的轉換上，比熱
機具有較高的效率，而且進行電化學
反應後的產物為純水，正符合現今提
倡的環保概念，可以說是環保綠色能
源科技，因此燃料電池是項值得開發
的技術[14]。經過四十年的發展，整個
燃料電池的技術依所使用的電解質，
而有以下幾種區分 :鹼性燃料電池
（ AFC ）、質子交換膜燃料電池
（PEMFC）、磷酸燃料電池（PAFC）、
熔融碳酸鹽燃料電池（MCFC）及固態
氧化物（SOFC）等，其中以操作溫度
較低（60~80°C）、能量密度高、無腐
蝕性液體之質子交換膜燃料電池，最
適合運用於機動車輛、日常生活電子
用品以及發電機[15]。其中共生型燃料
電池系統是目前全球發展之重點，因
此，本計畫主要目的在於進行共生型
燃料電池系統之設計、組裝、與測試，
系統除了提供電力需求外，亦可供應
熱水，由於同時產生電力與熱水，因
此大幅提升能源轉換效率，達到節能
與環保的雙重目的[16]。 
 
二、 文獻探討 
  本計畫主要探討定置型燃料電池
 
4 
 
電池發電熱電共生系統整合之研究。
本計畫首先進行燃料電池熱電共生系
統之各項次系統研究與開發，包括，
氫氣供應次系統、空氣供應次系統與
增濕器、回熱器與溫度控制次系統等，
並進行各次系統之動態模擬，藉以分
析其效率；其次，進行燃料電池堆之
性能測試以歸納燃料電池堆之最佳操
作條件；然後，本計畫將進行燃料電
池控制器之軟硬體設計與開發，將其
與燃料電池次系統整合而成為一套完
整之燃料電池熱電共生系統，並進行
燃料電池熱電共生系統之發電效率、
熱效率、與熱電共生效率之測試與分
析，緊接著進行耐久度測試與示範運
行；最後，再藉由 Simplorer 平台進
行燃料電池熱電共生系統之動態模擬
分析，提供實驗結果之比較與驗證。 
 
3.1. 燃料電池次系統（含 BOP 元件）
之研究、開發與性能測試 
  圖1為燃料電池熱電共生系統示
意圖。 
 
圖1 燃料電池熱電共生系統 
 
如圖1所示，各次系統簡單描述如下： 
1. 燃料電池堆：為燃料電池系統之動
力來源，係由多個單電池所組成。
本研究採用市售燃料電池堆，最大
淨輸出功率可達5kW，共計由65
個單電池所組成，陽極採用99.99%
之氫氣，陰極氧氣則由鼓風機抽取
空氣提供。 
2. 氫氣供應次系統（橘色迴路）：由
高壓鋼瓶供應之氫氣經調壓閥、電
磁閥、排氣閥等元件，進入燃料電
池的陽極內進行電化學反應，它的
功能除了提供氫氣與調節壓力之
外，尚包括氫氣循環利用、尾氣雜
質及水氣排除等。燃料電池內的氫
氣壓力完全由調壓閥及進排氣閥
控制，進氣電磁閥保持關閉模式
(常閉式)，當燃料電池內氫氣壓力
低於設定值後，立即開啟然後回復
關閉狀態，而排氣電磁閥之邏輯控
制則由操作模式決定，主要是藉由
排氣閥來排除氫氣源導入的雜質
及水氣。 
3. 空氣供應次系統與增濕器（綠色迴
路）：燃料電池的氧化劑係由一個
空氣壓縮機或空氣鼓風機提供，經
增濕器進行水、熱調節後，進入燃
料電池反應，之後經增濕器回收利
用並排放。為了控制進入燃料電池
空氣之品質，在空氣壓縮機之前會
置放一個空氣濾清器，進氣量是由
壓縮機馬達之轉速來控制，一般是
採用負載跟隨技術進行空氣壓縮
機馬達轉速之設計[26]，也就是空
氣壓縮機之馬達藉由PWM電路進
行控制轉速，基本上是空氣流量與
輸出電流成正比。 
4. 回熱器與溫度控制次系統（藍色迴
路）：燃料電池的操作溫度一般而
言以不超過80℃為宜，而燃料電池
所產生的熱一般有兩種處理方式，
一種是直接將熱直接散佈在大氣
中，另外一種則是將熱回收使用。
本計畫採用後者，所採用元件包括
冷媒泵浦、溫變開關閥、電熱管、
熱交換器、熱管理系統等，如圖2
所示。

從經驗公式中推得。 
  進行燃料電池動態行為分析時，
首先繪出其等效電路圖，如圖3所示，
其中輸入為氫氣與空氣，輸出則為電
流/電壓。當燃料電池斷路時，沒電流
通過時燃料電池為理想電壓UOCV，一
旦燃料電池輸出電流對外作功時，由
於兩電極存在活化極化ηact、濃度極化
ηconc、以及在歐姆極化ηohm，輸出電
壓會下降至UFC。決定燃料電池的輸出
電壓時，必須從理想電壓減去極化所
造成的過電位。

3.4. 燃料電池熱電共生系統之研究、
開發與示範 
  將各項次系統與燃料電池控制器
進行整合成為燃料電池熱電共生系統，
並進行性能量測與分析，包括熱效率、
電效率、與熱電合併效率等，並與系
統動態模結果相互比較，熱電共生系

cell stack should be recovered asmuch as possible, resulting in
favorable CHP efficiencies of a fuel cell cogeneration system.
The present work aims to overcome the difficulties
described above. The objective of the present work is to
develop a heat recovery unit (HRU) and implement it in a fuel
cell cogeneration system that generates electricity and hot
water efficiently. The HRU comprises a primary fluid (stack
coolant) circuit, a planar heat exchanger that facilitates the
heat transfer between the secondary fluid (tap water) and the
primary fluid (stack coolant), and a secondary fluid circuit.
During the heat transfer process within the planar heat
exchanger, total heat removed from the fuel cell stack is
transferred to the secondary fluid. As a result, conventional
radiators and fans for the heat dissipation are completely
eliminated. After fabricating the HRU, the stack coolant inlet
temperature (SCIT) and efficiencies of the cogeneration
system are measured and discussed in detail. First, the
dynamics of stack power and SCIT under standby and
constant-load conditions are studied to verify the stability of
the fuel cell cogeneration system. Then, the relationship
between SCIT and the actuation of the secondary fluid pump
is identified. Moreover, the effects of external loads on the
SCIT dynamics are examined. Finally, the system efficiencies,
including electrical efficiency, heat recovery efficiency, and
combined heat and power efficiency, are determined under
different external loads.
2. Experimental apparatus
2.1. Experimental setup
A schematic drawing of the PEM fuel cell cogeneration system
is shown in Fig. 1. It comprises a PEM fuel cell stack generating
electric power and a thermal regenerator recovering the heat
dissipated by the fuel cell stack. The nominal power of the fuel
stack is 5 kW and its technical specifications are briefly given
in Table 1. The air supply subsystem provides filtered, condi-
tioned air to the fuel cell stack. An air blower using load-
following mode controls the airflow rate to the stack. That is
the speed of the blower is a function of power output of the
fuel cell stack. A humidifier transfers heat and humidity from
the stack outlet gases to the inlet air stream. In the hydrogen
delivery subsystem, pure hydrogen flows into the stack for
electrochemical reaction. Then, the remaining hydrogen re-
circulates into the hydrogen pipeline at the stack inlet [13,14].
The bypass of the anode exhaust is equipped with a solenoid
valve to conditionally purge anode exhausts when the stack
voltage is reduced to a predetermined value. Electrically,
direct current (DC) generated by the fuel cell is converted to
alternating current (AC) by an inverter and subsequently
supplied to an external load, grid-connected with commercial
electric power supply. In other words, when the output power
from the fuel cell cogeneration system exceeds the external
load, excess power is “sold” to a utility. Thermally, the heat
dissipated by the fuel cell stack is removed by the stack
coolant, then transferred to the tap water, and finally is
restored in the hot-water reservoir for residential purposes.
The fabrication and test of a 5-kW PEM fuel cell system (Fig. 2)
has been described in detail in the author’s previous work [2].
2.2. Heat recovery unit
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the heat recovery unit in a PEM
fuel cell cogeneration system. Before designing the heat
recovery unit, two prospective goals are highlighted below.

only reduce the fuel cell temperature apart from the optimal
operation conditions but also consumes more pumping
power. Both are negative in electrical efficiencies. Conversely,
if the speeds of water pump P1 are too slow, the poor cooling
effect will cause malfunction of the fuel cell stack. In the
present work, a PWM (pulse width modulation) scheme is
utilized to optimize the flow rate of the secondary fluid under
minimized power consumption conditions. The SCIT is
controlled at 57 C under all operation conditions.
During operation, the water temperature in the buffer tank
(TS2) increases gradually. As shown in Fig. 6, when TS2
increases higher than a predesigned value (known as heat
recovery temperature), the water pump P2 begins pumping
hot water from the buffer tank to the hot-water reservoir. In
the meantime, cool fresh water pours into the buffer tank to
maintain the water level in the buffer tank. It stops pumping
the hotwaterwhen thewater temperature reduces lower than
the heat recovery temperature. Accordingly, the hot-water
reservoir receives hot water of heat recovery temperature
from the buffer tank. If the water temperature in the hot-
water reservoir decreases to the heat recovery temperature,
themicrocontroller issues a signal to command the fuel cell to
supply electric power to an electric heater inside the hot-
water reservoir. Thus, the cogeneration can supply hot water
of heat recovery temperature to end-users. The present work
fixed the heat recovery temperature at 50 C that is typical of
hot-water temperature for residential use.
Table 3 summarizes the experimental conditions of the
present work. The ambient temperature in the air-condi-
tioned laboratory is controlled at 25 2 C. The stack coolant
inlet temperature is fixed at 57 C, while the heat recovery
temperature is kept at 50 C. The external loads applied to the
fuel cell cogeneration system are varied from 0 to 3 kW.
2.3. Data reduction
Three kinds of system efficiencies are discussed, i.e., heat
recovery efficiency, electrical efficiency, and combined heat
and power (CHP) efficiency. The heat recovery efficiency is

1.7 VDC, the cathode air blower delivers minimum oxidant to
the cathode to keep the system in standby. In between, the
controller issues 25-Hz PWM signals to feed the cathode with
an optimal amount of oxidant under various stack power
conditions. Similar operation manners are applied to the
secondary fluid pump.
As shown in Fig. 8, the stack power steeply increases to
about 1.4 kWwhen the fuel cell cogeneration system starts up
which supports the auxiliary power and charges the battery as
well. In the meantime, the microcontroller issues a 5 VDC
signal to the cathode air blower that runs in the full-speed
mode.Atabout1200 s, thestackpowerdrops to950 W,which is
mainly due to the reduction of the power requirement of the
cathode air blower from the full-power mode (5 VDC) to the
standby mode (1.7 VDC). Note also in Fig. 8 that several pulses
of the stack power distribution at t¼ 5000 s, 5800 s, and 6600 s
areattributed to theactionsof thecathodeairblower. It runson
the full-power mode since the microcontroller senses low cell
voltages and thus commands the blower to blow out the
possible flooding water inside the cells.
Fig. 9(a) shows the liaison of the stack coolant inlet
temperature (SCIT) and the action of the secondary fluid
pump. As shown in this figure, the SCIT increases gradually to
about 57 C and then drops sharply (at about 950 s) where the
secondary fluid pump becomes active; after which, the SCIT
distribution becomes rippled. It reaches a periodic distribution
after about 3000 s. Fig. 9(b) shows a local magnification in the
periodic region of 5000e6000 s. In the fully developed region,
when the SCIT increases to 57 C (a predesigned value), the
pump P1 speeds up the secondary fluid to transfer more heat
from the stack coolant that thus reduces the SCIT. When the
SCIT decreases to 56 C, the secondary fluid pump P1 slows
down and the SCIT increases. The periodic process keeps the
SCIT in the range of 57 1 C.
Figs. 10 and 11 are examples illustrating the effect of
external loads on the electrical and thermal dynamics of the
fuel cell cogeneration system. As shown in Fig. 10, a step load
of 1.5 kW (orange curve) is applied to the fuel cell cogeneration
system at about 180 s. The red curve is the corresponding
power delivered by the fuel cell stack, while the green dashed
line is the signals issued by themicrocontroller to the cathode

of the other subsystems has been described in detail elsewhere [5].
Only some important features are stressed below.
2.1. Air delivery subsystem
The air delivery subsystem provides ﬁltered, conditioned air to
the fuel cell stack. The major components are the cathode air ﬁlter,
cathode air blower and humidiﬁer. The cathode air ﬁlter removes
particulate and chemical contaminates from the airstream. The
cathode air blower controls the airﬂow rate to the stack. The speed
of theblower isvariable that is a functionofDCoutputof the fuel cell
stack. The humidiﬁer transfers heat and humidity from the stack
outlet gases to the inlet airstream. It has no moving parts and uses
membrane material to exchange heat and moisture between the
incoming and outgoing airstreams.
2.2. Hydrogen delivery subsystem
The fuel cell cogeneration system is fueled by hydrogen at the
inlet pressure range of 4.0–7.0 atm. A normally closed hydrogen
inlet solenoid valve allows hydrogen ﬂow into the system, which
is actuated by 24VDC solenoid coil. The pressure regulator reduces
incoming hydrogen pressure (i.e., 4.0–7.0 atm) to 1.02 atm. A recir-
culating pump circulates unused hydrogen from the anode exit to

Fig. 5. Photo of the present fuel cell cogeneration system.
The heat dissipated by the fuel cell is recovered into useful
energy in the heat recovery unit (dashed block). The details of the
heat recovery unit are given in Fig. 2. The water temperature in the
buffer tank gradually increases during operation. When it reaches
a predetermined value (known as heat-recovery temperature), say
50 ◦C, the water pump begins impelling the hot water from the
buffer tank to a hot-water reservoir. Simultaneously, tap water is
poured into the buffer tank to keep the water level of the buffer
tank. It stops impelling the hot water when the water temperature
in the buffer tank reduces to a predetermined value, e.g., 48 ◦C. As a
result, thehot-water reservoir receives 48–50 ◦C tapwater fromthe
buffer tanknowand then. If thewater temperature in thehot-water
reservoir decreases to a predetermined value, e.g., 48 ◦C due to the
heat loss, the microcontroller issues a command signal to the fuel
cell to supply electric power to the electric heater installed inside
the hot-water reservoir. Thus, the fuel cell cogeneration system can
always provide hot water of temperature 48–50 ◦C to end-users.
2.5. Microcontroller
As shown in Fig. 3, a single-chip microcontroller together with
smart algorithms is developed for controlling the fuel cell cogen-
eration system under all operation conditions. In the present fuel
cell cogeneration system, an Intel 8051 microprocessor is used to
govern the system. It is capable of monitoring the sensor signals
of voltage, current, temperature, and pressure. It also takes appro-
priate actions in order to drive the actuation devices such as the
cathode air blower, solenoid valves, water pumps, and heaters. All
data and parameters are collected and downloaded to a personal
computer through the RS232 communication port on the micro-
controller. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4, a man–machine interface
(MMI) is designed for real-time monitoring the experimental data
and operation conditions of the fuel cell cogeneration system.
2.6. System integration and assessment
Before integrationof the fuel cell cogeneration system, each sen-
sor is calibrated using a laboratory-quality instrument that ensures
its accuracy and reliability over the ranges in which it is operated
[20]. Also, each actuator such as solenoid valves and relays is tested
independently in order to check its availability and performance.
Each subsystem is then assembled on a breadboard, and a series of
tests is conducted to verify these subsystems. Finally, all subsys-
tems are installed in a designed metallic box for housing the entire
system. Fig. 5 shows a photo of the present fuel cell cogeneration
system.
Safety is always a matter of concern about hydrogen-powered
systems. Before each run, regular leakage checks were conducted
for theentirehydrogenpipeline suchas connections, ﬁttings, valves

and the fuel cell stack. The microcontroller automatically performs
a shutdown whenever it detects a parameter out of a prescribed
range. During the assembly and testing of the fuel cell cogeneration
system,noaccidents, hazardousorpotentiallyhazardous situations
occurred.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Power and thermal dynamics
Fig. 6 shows the dynamics of the stack power (blue curve) under
a constant external load of 1 kW (i.e., net DC power, red dashed
line). (For interpretation of the references to color in this sen-
tence, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.) The
stack power is higher than the net DC power by 800–1300W. The
power gap represents the auxiliary consumptions and the trans-
mission/conversion losses in the electrical circuit. Note that the
step change in the stack-power distribution is mainly caused by
the operation of the cathode air blower. The power demand of the
air blower is dependent not only on the load operation but also
on the cell voltage. When the cell voltage decreases to an extent,
e.g., 0.4V per cell, the air blower should run in full power modes
to blow out the accumulated water inside the electrode. Therefore,
the power step is due to the action of the air blower. In addition,
the stack power goes downwith time is because the power require-
ment for charging the secondary battery is reduced gradually. Due
to the space limitation, the hybridization of the fuel cell and the
secondary battery will be discussed in our future effort.
Fig. 7 shows the dynamics of the stack coolant inlet temperature
(SCIT) under the external load of 1 kW. It is seen that the SCIT keeps
in the range of 57±2 ◦C that guarantees proper operation temper-
ature of the fuel cell [17–19]. The high frequency of temperature
ﬂuctuation in this ﬁgure is coincident with by the PWM frequency
of the secondary-ﬂuid pump, which is also shown by little ripples
on the stack-power distribution in Fig. 6.

tric power for the family power demands (Fig. 8(a)). As shown in
Fig. 11, on the off-peak stages, the grid supplies the electric power
to the user power demand, while the fuel cell cogeneration system
keeps off. In the peak-power periods, the grid provides the base
load up to 1kW (red dashed line), and the deﬁciency of power is
offset by the fuel cell cogeneration system (orange shade block).
(For interpretation of the references to color in this sentence, the
reader is referred to the web version of the article.) As indicated in
Fig. 11, about 300 L hot water is produced by the fuel cell cogenera-
tion system which is enough to support the daily need for a family.
Noteworthy that the economic signiﬁcance of the above applica-
tion is not only the high system efﬁciency by producing useful
hot water but also highly valued electric power generated in peak-
power periods. Moreover, surplus electric power produced by the
fuel cell cogeneration system could feed into the grid to relax the
pressure of high power demand in the peak periods.
3.4. Efﬁciencies of the cogeneration system
The electrical efﬁciency of the fuel cell cogeneration system can
be determined by accounting for the stack power, auxiliary power
consumption and power conversion/transmission loss. Table 1 lists
the electric features of the major auxiliary components in the fuel
cell cogeneration system. The present work, however, does not
use this approach since it is difﬁcult to accurately determine the
efﬁciency of each power conversion device and the power con-
sumption of supported components. For example, it is hard to catch
the real power dissipation by the temperature-dependent pump,
which ﬂuctuates by the speed-up and the slow-down of the motor
during the operation. The efﬁciency is herein deﬁned as the ratio of
the net power delivered to external load from the fuel cell cogen-
eration system to the enthalpy ﬂow (lower heating value) of the
consumed hydrogen, i.e.,
εE =
PL
PH2
= I × V
nH2 × h
(1)
where PL is the net power output to the external load from the fuel
cell that is a direct measure of voltage (V) across the external load
and the current (I) passing through the circuit. As for PH2 , it is hard
to directly measure the hydrogen consumption rate (nH2) in the
Fig. 12. Effectof external loadon theefﬁcienciesof the fuel cell cogenerationsystem.
fuel cell anode. An alternative method to determine the hydrogen
consumption rate is given below. The hydrogen oxidation reaction
in the anode of a fuel cell is:
H2 → 2H+ +2e− (2)
Therefore, the hydrogen consumption rate is proportional to the
protons (also current) through the fuel cell during reaction. That is
thecurrentpassing through the fuel cell can represent thehydrogen
consumption rate:
εE =
I × V
0.5 × I × N × C × h (3)
where N is the number of the cells in the stack and C is a transfer
coefﬁcient between the hydrogen consumption rate and current,
i.e., 0.6267mgH2 A−1 min−1. Theheat recovery efﬁciency is deﬁned
as the ratio of heat recovered by the secondary ﬂuid (tap water) to
the hydrogen energy consumption. That is,
εT =
Pwater
PH2
= mH2OcH2O T
0.5I × N × C × h (4)
where mH2O (kg s
−1) is the mass ﬂow rate of hot water, cH2O, the
speciﬁc heat of water (kJ kg−1 K−1), and T, the water temperature
difference (K).
The combined heat and power (CHP) efﬁciency in the present
cogeneration is:
εCHP = εT + εE (5)
Fig. 12 shows theefﬁciencies of the fuel cell cogeneration system
as a function of the external load. The general trend of the electrical
efﬁciency is an increase of εE with increasing external load. It com-
pares well to test results from other researches made on fuel cell
systems [21] and the author’s previous work [5]. It is interesting to
note that the commercial non-cogeneration FC system, Plug Power
GenCore, shows an electrical efﬁciency above 35% (HHV) for most
of the power demand. The difference of the electrical efﬁciency
between the present cogeneration FC unit and the standard FC unit

2025, and to cut that level in half by 2050. The government is now speeding up its formulation of 
measures to help lower GHG emissions, such as developing renewable energy, improving energy 
efficiency, imposing carbon tax on fossil fuels, and increasing low-carbon energy in the power structure. 
The objective of this paper is to assess the outcome of GHG emission reduction of Taiwan in the past 
decade. Then, an updated review of the policy progress of GHG emission reduction is presented. It also 
proposes integration planning strategies of the policy instruments related to energy and GHG reduction 
in the country in the post-Kyoto era. 
 
2. Energy Supply Structure 
 Taiwan, with land area of 36,190 km2 and population of 22.86 millions, has the world＇s second 
highest population density, i.e. 621 capita per km2. During the last twenty years (1988-2008), with the 
exception of negative growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2001 (-2.17%), Taiwan＇s annual 
GDP growth rates ranged from 1.7% to 12.6% [1]. In order to maintain the momentum of economic 
growth, Taiwan relies on vast energy supply. In the meantime, the average annual growth rate for total 
installed power capacity is 3.1%, while average annual growth rate for peak load is 1.0%. It is obvious 
that rapid economic progress is followed by higher energy demand during the last two decades in this 
country. That is GDP and energy consumption are highly correlated in Taiwan＇s economy.  
 However, Taiwan is lack of indigenous energy and more than 98.1% of total energy supply is 
imported. Figure 1 shows the structure variation by fuels of total primary energy supply (TPES) of 
Taiwan from 1990 to 2007 [2]. The total amount of primary energy supply increased from 40.5 million 
metric tons of oil equivalent (TOE) in 1990 to 112.56 million metric tons of oil equivalent in 2007, for 
an annual average growth rate of 5.1%. From 1990 to 2007, the structure of energy supply by fuel in 
Taiwan has changed as follows: 
• Coal＇s share increased from 23.6% in 1990 to 37.6% in 2007, 
• Petroleum decreased from 54.3% to 42.7%, 
• Natural gas increased from 3.2% to 9.8%, 
• Hydropower decreased from 1.13% to 0.34%, 
• Nuclear power decreased from 17.7% to 9.36%, and 
• Renewable energy (hydropower exclusive) increased 0.04% to 0.12%. 
 Basically, Taiwan is highly dependent on fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas) in 
its energy mix, with these energy forms together accounting for 90.1% of total primary energy supply in 
2007. Carbon-free fuels (hydropower, nuclear power and renewable energy) however contributed less 
than 10% of total primary energy supply in 2007. 
 Figure 2 further shows the share structures of the total primary energy supply by sectors in 
Taiwan [2]. From 1990 to 2007, the sectoral share of the total primary energy supply in Taiwan has 
changed as follows: 
• Energy sector share decreases from 9.8 % in 1990 to 8.7% in 2007, 
• Industrial sector increased from 48.5% to 51.7%, 
• Transportation sector decreased from 15.8% to 13.1%, 
• Agricultural sector decreased from 2.9% to 0.9%, 
• Service sector increased from 6.1% to 10.1%, 
• Residential sector changes slightly from 11.9% to 11.2%, and 
improvement service and expanding the green building endeavor. 
The above strategies were mostly made from the bottom-up perspective. However, these measures 
involving changes of human habits and ways of life are very difficult to evaluate their reduction 
effectiveness. It was found that there is high uncertainty in achieving this GHG reduction target, due to 
lack of policy evaluation and cost analysis. 
In 2008, Taiwan government proposed a set of rules designed to achieve a sizable reduction of 
carbon dioxide emissions, namely, Frameworks of Sustainable Energy Policy. The target of top-down 
approach is to keep carbon dioxide emissions during the 2016-2020 periods at the 2008 level, to reduce 
them to the 2000 level in 2025, and to cut that level in half by 2050. Subsequently, “The Third 
National Energy Conference＂ held in 2009 further confirmed these targets. 
3.2 GHG emission inventory 
The results of CO2 emission from fuel combustion of Taiwan [6] are evaluated in Figs 4-8. Figure 
4 shows the trends of total CO2 emission from 1990 to 2007 in Taiwan. The blue circles are the results 
using the reference approach (top-down), while the red bars represent the results using the sectroal 
approach (bottom–up). The annul growth rates of total CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2000 are about 
6.9% and 6.7% for the reference and sectoral approaches, respectively. After 2000, the annul growth 
rates are reduced to 3.3% for both approaches.  
Figures 5 and 6 show the Taiwan＇s ranks of total CO2 emission and per capita CO2 emission 
from fuel combustion in the world in 2007, respectively. The results are based on the sectoral approach. 
It ranks 21st and 18th in the world in total CO2 emission and per capita CO2 emission, respectively [6].  
 Figure 7 further shows a comparison of change rate of the total CO2 emission from 1990 to 2007 
among several counties and regions. In is seen the total CO2 emission in 2007 increased 140.8% as 
compared to the 1990 results, which is much higher than those of the world (38%) and Annex 1 Parties 
(2.6%). In addition, Taiwan＇s increase rate of total CO2 emission is higher than most of the 
neighboring countries except for China. 
 Figure 8 shows the trends of carbon intensity (CO2 emission/GDP) from 1990 to 2007 for several 
relevant countries. Except for Korea, Taiwan＇s carbon intensity is higher than those of countries 
shown in this figure. In addition, the countries belonging to Annex 1 Parties (Japan, German, UK, 
France) decrease their carbon intensity after 1995. However, the carbon intensity of Taiwan begins 
decreasing since 2003. The delay of the decrease in the carbon intensity reflects the waver of 
governmental ambition in combating the climate change. 
3.3 Dilemma of GHG emission reduction 
 Judging from the above discussion about CO2 emission from fuel combustion, it is undoubted that 
Taiwan is not good in the mitigation of climate change in the past two decades, which pushed Taiwan＇
s emissions close to the top 20 among global economies. There are some dilemmas in reduction of GHG 
emission in Taiwan, which are described below. 
 First, there is lack of specific national reduction blueprint before 2008. From 1998 to 2008, 
Taiwan wavered between top-down and bottom-up reduction target, which is a reflection of the national 
attitude toward the climate change issues. The ambiguity of international convention caused the 
uncertainty in government decision-making, and has thus influenced the global community for more 
than a decade. With the slow progress of the post-Kyoto negotiations like COP13 in Bali and COP15 in 
Copenhagen, this trend is expected to continue and will subject Taiwan as well as other developing 
emission reduction, and imposing carbon taxes on fossil fuels. They are described as bellows. 
4.1 Developing renewable energy 
 The government has passed the bill of “Statute for Renewable Energy Development＂ in June 
2009 [8] that aims to heighten the domestic energy supply, reduce GHG emissions, and establish 
renewable energy industry. The mechanisms provide incentives for investment in power facilities and 
promote the use of renewable energy up to a total installed capacity of 6.5-10 GW. As shown in Table 4, 
the current status (2008) of installed renewable energies in Taiwan is described as follows: 1937.9MW 
for hydropower generation; 252 MW for wind power generation; 5.6MW for solar photovoltaics; 739.3 
MW for biomass electrification; the aforementioned data summation is 2934.8 MW, share of which is 
6.32% of the nationwide installed capacity in 2008. According to the bill, the share of renewable energy 
to total generation capacity is projected to increase to 17% by 2030 [8]. It will be near triple current 
generation capacity from renewable sources. The bill is estimated to spur at least NT$ 30 billion (US$ 
937 million) in investment in the first year and create more than 10,000 jobs.  
 In parallel with the renewable energy development bill, in August 2009, Taiwan government 
further approved a project for new industrial development, “Takeoff Program for the Green Energy 
Industry,＂ which will invest NT$ 45 billion (US$ 1.4 billion) in the domestic renewable energy sector 
in an attempt to help the sector grow nearly eight-fold by 2015 thereby increasing industry production 
value to NT$ 1.158 trillion in 2015 compared to NT$ 160.3 billion in mid-2009. The green energy 
sector will help Taiwan become a major power in energy technology and production, as well as provide 
the 110 thousands green jobs [9]. The Takeoff Program was divided into two parts. The first part 
focused on solar photovolatics and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which aims to make Taiwan one of the 
world's top-three producers of solar cells and the world's largest supplier of LED lights and modules. 
Taiwan will change all of its 700,000 traffic signals to LEDs and will aim to complete the construction 
of Asia's largest solar power plant by 2011. LEDs are likely to capture a larger portion of the market for 
nearly every type of lighting, including displays of electronic devices, streetlights, commercial signage, 
traffic lights, large public information screens, and LED TVs. The other part of the Takeoff Program 
promoted wind power generation, biofuels, hydrogen and fuel cells, energy information and 
communication technology, and electric vehicles. The government aims to develop Taiwan into a global 
supplier of wind power generation systems and help the island become a key production base for 
electric vehicles and fuel cell system assembly in the Asia-Pacific region. 
4.2 Improving energy efficiency 
 In the Frameworks of Sustainable Energy Policy, the government has committed to an energy 
efficiency improvement of 2% annually for the next few years. So, as compared with the level in 2005, 
energy intensity will decrease 20% by 2015. Supplemented by further technological breakthroughs and 
proper administrative measures, energy intensity will decrease 50% by 2025. This target is stricter than 
Japan's commitment to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative (APEC) meetings, which holds a 25%-26% 
energy efficiency target by 2025 [10]. Table 5 lists the promotion of energy conservation schemes and 
the corresponding targets in various sectors. Their targets are summarized as below: 
1. Industrial sector: reduce the carbon intensity more than 30% by 2025 (baseline year 2008). 
2. Transportation sector: raise the fuel efficiency standard for private vehicles by 25% in 2015 
(baseline year 2008) 
3. Residential and commercial sector: raise appliance efficiency standards by 10% to 70% in 
• Cap and Trade schemes: In the final stage of the GHG management, Taiwan will set a national 
emissions target and implement a domestic cap-and-trade system, as a part of our economic and 
financial policy instruments to reduce GHG emissions. The timing and stringency of the target 
setting would depend on the progress of international negotiations on climate change, as stipulated 
in the Bill. 
4.4 Imposing carbon taxes on fossil fuels 
 Literature has identified taxes as an efficient way of internalizing costs of GHG emissions [7]. 
Levying the energy (carbon) tax was a politics of President Ma Yin-Jeou in 2008 campaign. Thereafter, 
the Frameworks of Sustainable Energy Policy includes “legislating the Regulations on Energy (carbon) 
Tax to reflect the external cost of energy consumption＂ into its vital regulatory frameworks. The 
energy-tax policy is currently on the drawing board of the Executive Yuan (Cabinet). There will be 
many complementary measures and amendments to existing laws before the implementation of energy 
(carbon) tax policy. 
 According to the governmental schedule, first, the energy tax will be the integration of the 
existing fuel tax such as commodity tax, fuel use tax, and petroleum fund. That is it will consolidate the 
fees that everyone already pays into a single energy tax. Therefore, the government does not raised taxes 
at all in this stage. In the next stage, carbon (new) taxes will be imposed on fossil fuels based on the 
carbon price3. In the governmental design, the carbon tax should be revenue-neutral, i.e., no tax increase. 
The impacts of added costs will be softened by paying back the tax revenues (dividends) or reducing 
other taxes (tax-shifting), such as raising the minimum imputation credit for income tax computation, 
and implementing energy welfare programs for guaranteeing the basic right of the people to a minimum 
energy supply. In addition, the timing for imposing carbon taxes would depend on international trends, 
especially the actions of neighboring nations such as China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asian 
countries. That is the government will consider the domestic industrial development and 
competitiveness, and especially the approach of the above rivals in their deliberations over the carbon 
tax. That way will soften the measure's impact on industry and help maintain its competitiveness. 
Actually, none of the above nations have levied carbon so far. Thus, the carbon-tax policy would not be 
implemented before 2011 based on the governmental estimation. 
4.5 Increasing carbon-free energy mix 
In addition to the regulatory frameworks list in Table 3, the Frameworks of Sustainable Energy 
Policy reconsiders nuclear power as a carbon-free energy option, which will be the major approach to 
increase the share of low carbon energy from the current 40% to 55% in 2025 (one of targets of the 
Policy) in electricity generation systems. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report [7], the 
nuclear power belongs to key mitigation technologies and practices currently commercially available. 
Figure 9 concluded the relation between carbon intensity of generation (per kWh emission) and share of 
the nuclear power in its power capacity in several countries. It is seen from this figure that the higher 
share of nuclear power in the generation capacity is, the lower is the carbon intensity of generation. 
Notable drops of the curve of carbon intensity of generation for German and Unite Kingdom are 
                                                 
3  The public and private sectors has discussed the carbon price for a long time but did not reach 
a consensus about the carbon price yet. The proposed carbon price varied from NT$750 to 
NT$2000 per metric ton.   
measures. 
2. Taiwan will step up the GHG inventory scheme in conjunction with the implementation of 
validation system by the government, and publish national report of GHG at an opportune time. 
3. Taiwan will implement its GHG control strategies and action plans, including improving efficiency 
of energy use, promoting energy conservation, developing renewable energy, imposing carbon tax 
on fossil fuels, and increasing the share of carbon-free fuel in its generation structure. 
4. Taiwan will watch closely the development of post-Kyoto and gather information on the current 
status of emission trading in the international community to avoid any international sanction and 
ensure sustained development.
