Ahn & Kaminsky [2]探討單一產品於兩階段混合拉推式之生產配銷供應鏈，假設第一階

多廠區規劃方法 
(1).集中控制（Centralized）規劃 
Christian & Kallrath [3]學者探討化學產業之多廠區規劃，已知各時間點各產品需求量，
規劃各期各廠區需投入的原物料量、生產數量與廠區之間產品的運送數量，並同時考量運
輸產能、生產產能、物料限制、及需求限制等，目標為最小化生產、整備、運輸與庫存成
本，透過混合整數規劃(MIP)求解。 
Sambasivan & Yahya [6]學者探討在多廠區結構下，多產品具有生產批量以及多時期的
問題進行研究，透過啟發式法則進行求解。主要是先假設產能無限，並決定產品於廠區上
的負荷，而後檢查是否有任一廠區的產能超過負荷，若有，則將產能超過負荷的部份不斷
進行挪動，挪移到可替代的廠區或是該廠區的其他生產時點，當所有廠區均可完成時則結
束規劃邏輯。 
(2).分散運作（Decentralized）規劃 
Schneeweiss & Zimmer [7]學者探討由下游往上游規劃的方式（Upstream planning），當
製造商收到顧客的確定性需求時，為了達到相關生產成本最小化的目標，規劃出零組件的
實際需求量，並將零組件的實際需求量送至供應商；而供應商以追求利潤極大化的目標下，
規劃求出零組件的配送數量，供應商在規劃時須考慮到當所提供的零組件配送數量與製造
商需求的零組件實際需求量不一致時，製造商可向供應商索取懲罰成本。在有各自規劃目
標與規劃環境下，如何透過相互協商的機制求得雙方可執行的一致性計畫。 
Yimer & Demirli [9]學者探討 build-to-order 的生產鏈結構。phase 1 主要規劃成品組裝與
成品配銷，而 phase 2 主要規劃半成品的製造與原物料的採購。由於兩階段的規劃目標、範
圍與驅動條件都有所差異，作者提出 two phase sequential approach 進行規劃，首先由 phase

5. 結果與討論 
由於本成果報告篇幅限制關係，此處僅呈現多機種情境範例，略過單ㄧ機種範例結果。 
本研究以目前業界之 TFT-LCD 拉推式供應網路規劃議題為例，陣列、組立與模組製程
各擁有兩座廠區，由於面板製程技術造成廠區世代數不同，因此產品在陣列廠區與組立廠
區之間必須同世代才可進行運輸。由於情境範例所需輸入資料繁多，礙於篇幅限制故此處
省略，此些資料包含訂單資訊、廠區產品產能與產品良率資訊、組立廠區產品的經濟切割
資訊、模組廠區至訂單指定交貨地點的運輸前置時間、機種產品的組成結構、各機種產品
的組配組成結構等。

劃流程與拉推式供應網路規劃流程進行規劃可得到表 1，由表 1 可以發現組立製程要追求
最大化產能利用率的情況下會產生兩種現象，其一為產品集中於產能耗用率較高的廠區進

果來得高，原因在於拉推式供應網路規劃所規劃生產的數量較多；但隨著訂單需求預測的
增加，兩規劃流程縮規劃生產的數量相當接近，且傳統規劃流程在追求最大產品產能利用
率，造成機種產品競爭廠區與產品產能的情況，因此在高訂單需求預測情況下，傳統規劃
流程有較高的產品產能利用率。 
由圖 5 可以發現多機種與單一機種的訂單延遲於兩規劃流程下的結果相似，本研究所
提出拉推式供應網路規劃於多機種產品的情境下，依然有較佳的績效表現。

由多機種情境範例可以知道在進行多產品規劃時，傳統規劃流程在考量產品產能與廠

影響；而本研究所提出之拉推式供應網路規劃優先考量實際訂單需求的情況下再去追求可
用產能，於低訂單需求預測的情況下本研究所提出規劃流程於訂單延遲與產能利用率的績
效皆優於傳統規劃流程，而隨著訂單需求預測的增加，本研究所提出之規劃流程於產能利
用率的績效與傳統規劃流程的差距會逐漸減小，甚至會被傳統規劃流程所超越；但本研究
所提出之規劃流程於訂單延遲的績效表現仍優於傳統規劃流程。 
6. 結論 
TFT-LCD 產業由於生產鏈、產品、訂單需求、產能供給與製程相關特性，使得供應網
路規劃問題的處理較其他產業來得複雜，因此本研究針對 TFT-LCD 產業所存在的問題提出
一套改善流程。首先探討現有 TFT-LCD 產業在生產環境與產品特性上有別於其他產業的特
殊之處，並說明這些特殊的特性如何影響供應網路規劃，以至於該產業的供應網路規劃問
題相對複雜；之後針對該產業特殊的供應網路規劃議題，如何考量推式與拉式供應網路的
限制與目標，建構推式與拉式兩階段一致的生產與配銷計劃，使得訂單延遲時間縮短與提
升產能利用率。 
本研究提出一套新的供應網路規劃流程，同時考量訂單與組配限制、多廠區生產與製
程限制，透過供應網路規劃模式的計算，決定各筆訂單的延遲時間、各製程下各廠區的投
入產出生產計劃、廠區間運輸計劃與物料採購計劃。然後透過模擬模式來評估供應網路規
劃模式的結果是否具備合理性，並以一台灣 TFT-LCD 面板公司之多機種產品為例，驗證所
提出之混合拉式與推式供應網路規劃流程之績效，並與傳統規劃流程進行比較而說明本研
究計畫之成果。

Abstract - The foundry is an industry whose demand 
varies rapidly and whose manufacturing process is quite 
complicated. This paper explores issues of mid-term capacity 
planning in the foundry. First of all, issues of capacity 
planning of the foundry are categorized. Secondly, focusing 
on the multi-site planning, an increment strategy for the 
number of the accessory tool—“photo mask” is proposed to 
increase the flexibility of production. The related decisions 
include how to appropriately allocate the forecast demands 
of products among multiple sites and decide the production 
quantities of products in each site after receiving the 
customer confirmed orders. By constructing the 
mathematical programming model of capacity planning, it is 
found that the rates of capacity utilization and customer 
order fulfillment are effectively enhanced by adding new 
masks to increase the production flexibility.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 Taiwanese manufacturers have been involved in the 
semiconductor industry for nearly 30 years. The foundry 
industry and the supply chain model make a great impact 
on the global semiconductor market. The three 
characteristics of the semiconductor industry make the 
capacity planning in the foundries even more difficult. 
These three characteristics are as follows.  
1. Fast progress of the technology in the 
manufacturing process: As the manufacturing 
technology advances, the sizes of manufacturing 
elements decrease. For design manufacturers, the 
more IC are produced in per unit area, the lower 
the cost is.  
2. High manufacturing cost: With the fact that the 
price of one semiconductor equipment is as high 
as several billion US dollars, the overall 
production cost is greatly enhanced.  
3. Great variability in demand: Orders of foundry 
companies source from IC designers and 
Integrated Device Manufacturers. Considering 
the cost of inventory, customers never 
predetermine the order until demand occurs. In 
peak seasons, the rising demand from IC 
designers and insufficient capacity of integrated 
device manufactures lead to the surge of orders 
and as a result, customers scramble for the 
production capacity. To the contrary, in slack 
seasons exists the phenomenon of low utilization 
of capacity. 
Medium-term Multi-plant Capacity Planning Problems  
for Semiconductor Foundry

 Consequently, the foundry is an industry whose 
demand varies rapidly and whose manufacturing process 
is quite complicated. This paper explores issues of mid-
term capacity planning in the foundry. First of all, issues 
of capacity planning of the foundry are categorized. 
Secondly, focusing on the multi-site planning, an 
increment strategy for the number of the accessory tool—
“photo mask” is proposed to increase the flexibility of 
production. The related decisions include how to 
appropriately allocate the forecast demands of products 
among multiple sites and decide the production quantities 
of products in each site after receiving the customer 
confirmed orders. 
 Karabuk and Wu [1] present the capacity planning 
involves two main components. The first decision, 
capacity expansion, is to identify the required 
manufacturing technologies and their capacity levels to be 
physically expanded or outsourced through the planning 
period. The second is capacity configuration decision 
which determines which facility is to be configured with 
which technology mix. 
 Hopp and Spearman [2] propose that the capacity 
planning must consider how much and what type of 
capacity to install and have a major impact on all other 
production planning issues (e.g., aggregate planning, 
demand management, sequencing and scheduling). 
Additionally, when capacity decision makers have 
decided to add capacity, there are several issues to address: 
(1) how much and when should capacity be added? (2) 
what type of capacity should be added? (3) where should 
additional capacity be added? 
 Geng and Jiang [3] give a detailed review of strategic 
capacity planning for the semiconductor manufacturing 
industry. Bhatnager et al. [4] present a finite-horizon 
Markov decision process (MDP) model for providing 
decision support in semiconductor manufacturing on such 
critical operational issues as when to add additional 
capacity including purchasing (or discarding) equipment 
or upgrading equipment/processes, and when to convert 
from one type of production to another. Bermon and 
Hood [5] and Catay et al. [6] develop a deterministic 
LP/MIP model for capacity planning decision with the 
procurement of new equipment/tools within a single 
semiconductor manufacturing facility. Reference [5] 
indicates that capacity optimization planning of the 
semiconductor fabrication finds the volume mix of 
products to maximize profit, constrained by the existing 
 to long production cycle time and different characteristics 
of products. The production plan is based on the demand 
predictions provided by customers. The planners reserve 
the capacity for customers beforehand, and tackle the 
forecast netting when the real orders are received. 
 
C. Consideration factors for capacity planning in wafer 
foundries 
 
When wafer foundries deal with the capacity 
planning, they will consider the following factors.  
 Demand of customers: The capacity is planned 
by the unit of month. Customers will provide the 
demand forecasts for the coming twelve months. 
Since there are different manufacturing 
conditions for various products, the demand 
forecasts should be detailed according to the 
process of each product (i.e. 0.18um, 0.25um, 
etc.). The capacity planning is based on the 
demand forecast of each month and each 
manufacturing process.  
 Preferred sites of customers: The manufacturing 
process of semiconductors is quite complex, with 
more than a hundred steps. There are specific 
parameter settings for each product. Therefore, 
due to the uniqueness of the workstation or the 
difference of experiences for engineers, 
customers preferred that their products are 
manufactured in a specific factory with a high 
yield rate or by engineers with whom they’ve 
cooperated for a long time. As a result, customers 
will request the preferred factory at certain 
manufacturing processes when they provide the 
demand forecasts. 
 Capacity and manufacturing techniques: The 
capacity of workstations in wafer foundries is 
limited. The building of a semiconductor factory 
will take 18-24 months, so the capacity is not 
easy to expand within a short-term period. Thus, 
the capacity constraint should be taken into 
consideration when the capacity planning. 
Furthermore, the manufacturing technique should 
be considered as well. The average span of time 
between the different generations of 
semiconductor equipment is approximately 18 
months. Different generations have different 
manufacturing techniques so that it is possible 
that a certain product can only be processed in 
some specific factories. Therefore, when 
planning and allocating the reserved capacity, 
these constraints should be taken into 
consideration.  
 Photo mask limitation: Masks are necessary 
accessory tools when manufacturing wafers. The 
mask used to produce a certain product is 
applicable to a specific workstation. Thus, a 
certain mask is only applied in the single site and 
can not be applied in several sites.  
 The level of importance for customers: The level 
of importance for customers is defined based on 
the production profit. The manufacturing priority 
is ranked according to the level of importance for 
customers when the capacity planning in case 
those important customers are not able to acquire 
enough capacity. 
 
D. Stages for capacity planning in wafer foundries 
 
Currently, the capacity planning can be divided into 
two steps. At the first stage, capacity is reserved for the 
current month according to the demand forecasts provided 
by customers. At the second stage, the reserved capacity 
is allocated and forecasts netting according to the real 
orders.  
Details are described as follows. 
 At the first stage 
1. Input the demand forecasts for twelve months 
provided by customers into the system, and 
aggregate the amount of products to be produced 
per month. 
2. Confirm with the factory which have been tested 
valid for the customers’ products and rank the 
priority for reserving the capacity according to the 
level of importance for customers.  
3. Since a set of masks can be used in single site, 
even if there is surplus capacity in other sites, the 
products of the customers can not be 
manufactured there.  
4. Calculate the remaining capacity after the 
allocation. And check whether there are still 
customers whom the capacity has not been 
reserved for. The stage will be continued if there 
is one.  
 At the second stage 
1. Confirm the month of the orders: Sometimes the 
order will span several months because of the 
different methods of transactions and financial 
systems. Therefore, it is necessary to make clear 
the real number of orders for each production 
month.  
2. According to the rule of “first in, first out”, the 
customer who places the orders first has the 
higher priority to acquire reserved capacity. 
Meanwhile, whether there is remaining capacity 
and whether the capacity is insufficient is decided. 
If the capacity is insufficient, it is necessary to 
optimize the capacity allocation again. 
3. Lastly, confirm the date to deliver the products 
and the production schedule for the current month. 
 
 
III.  THE MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING 
MODEL OF CAPACITY PLANNING 
 
A.  Problems of capacity planning in current wafer 
foundries 
 
 foundry. The yield rates of the same process in different 
factories might varies due to the difference in machines, 
and thus customers will certificate the manufacturing 
capability of factories. Only certificated factories are 
allowed to manufacture the products. 
 The balance equation for the number of photo masks, 
as in (5) and (6). The total number of masks equals to the 
original number of masks for products plus the number of 
new purchased masks. 
 The total allocated number of products to be 
manufactured in each factory will not be larger than the 
number of available masks, as in (7) and (8). 
 The constraint (9) is the cost limit to purchase masks. 
It is not easy to consider the time for the depreciation of 
masks when deciding whether to purchase masks or not. 
One of the easiest ways to make the decision is that the 
total sales of products in wafer foundries should be larger 
than the cost of purchasing new masks. 
 Though compared to the semiconductor equipment, 
the cost of masks is much lower; there is still an upper 
limit in the amounts of sets of masks due to the diversity 
of semiconductor products and their uncertainty in the 
product life cycle. This constraint is as in (10).  
 By constructing the mathematical programming 
model of capacity planning, it is found that the rates of 
capacity utilization and customer order fulfillment are 
effectively enhanced by adding new masks to increase the 
production flexibility. 
 
 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
 
The foundry is an industry whose demand varies 
rapidly and whose manufacturing process is quite 
complicated. This paper explores issues of mid-term 
capacity planning in the foundry. An increment strategy 
for the number of the accessory tool—“photo mask” is 
proposed to increase the flexibility of production. The 
related decisions include how to appropriately allocate the 
forecast demands of products among multiple sites and 
decide the production quantities of products in each site 
after receiving the customer confirmed orders. 
With the improved capacity planning, decision 
makers can be reminded of the future bottleneck in 
capacity so that they can purchase the new masks in time 
to enhance the capacity utilization in factories and further 
enhance the rate of order fulfillment.

 Fig. 1. A Design Methodology for SCOR-Based Supply Chain Simulation 
2   SCOR-based Supply Chain Simulation Modeling Framework  
A generic supply chain system shown in Fig. 2 is a structural system and composed of several 
standard components. Supply chain members such as manufacturer, supplier or distributor are 
an important component which determines the supply chain structure. Each member has dif-
ferent functions such that the distributor only has source and distribution functions without 
manufacturing function. Each member is operated and interacted through exchanging some 
flow items such as information, material, finished good or cash. In order to achieve the effi-
ciency of the supply chain system, each member will make their decision policy to control 
when the flow items should be executed and which flow items will be executed. Therefore, we 
can define some basic and standard elements for helping to construct the supply chain simula-
tion model systematically. 
The research proposes a SCOR-based Supply Chain Simulation Modeling Framework to 
identify the standard elements (components) for building the supply chain simulation model 
according to the SCOR reference model. This modeling framework involves the four basic 
elements: (1) supply chain structure element, (2) supply chain policy element, (3) supply 
chain flow element, and (4) supply chain data element. Supply chain structure element pro-
vides the classification of supply chain member with the different functions. Supply chain 
policy element defines several control rules, such as inventory policy or source policy. Supply 
chain flow element involves the three exchanging flow items: information flow, material flow 
and financial flow. Finally, supply chain data element provides some required basic data for 
the supply chain model. 
 
Fig. 2. The components of the generic supply chain system 
2.1   Supply Chain Structure Element 
Although each member in the supply chain system represents the different company, some 
members have the same functions such that all manufacturers have manufacturing, source and 
distribution functions. Therefore, the following supply chain structure element classifies the 
involves three different categories: planning-based inventory policy, stock-based inventory 
policy, and demand-based inventory policy. 
(1) Planning-based Inventory Policy 
The replenishment of planning-based inventory policy as shown in Fig. 3 is driven by the 
planning decision based on mid-term demand forecast such as the traditional material re-
quirement planning (MRP) or master production schedule (MPS). 
(2) Stock-based Inventory Policy 
The replenishment of stock-based inventory policy as shown in Fig. 3 is driven by the 
predefined inventory policy such as reorder point replenishment policy, (s, S) replenishment 
policy, or periodic replenishment policy. 
(3) Demand-based inventory policy 
The replenishment of demand-based inventory policy as shown in Fig. 3 is driven by the 
actual customer order. 
     
Fig. 3. Planning-based Inventory Policy, Stock-based Inventory Policy & Demand-based 
inventory policy 
 Source Policy 
The source policy of the supply chain includes three rules: lot-for lot (L4L), minimum pur-
chasing quantities and maximizes purchasing quantities. Each purchasing policy also has the 
corresponding purchasing lead time. 
 Make Policy 
The make policy involves three different strategies: chase-demand, level-capacity and 
batch-production strategy. 
 Deliver Policy 
The deliver policy has two different rules: less than truckload (LFL) and full truckload 
(Full TL). Each rule involves some transportation attributes such as the transportation quanti-
ties, transportation lead time, transportation modes. 
 Finance Policy 
The goods transactions will drive the cash flow. The financial policy defines when the 
cash flow should be executed. The financial policy involves two rules: real-time payment and 
the delayed lead-time payment. 
2.3   Supply Chain Flow Element 
Flow items are an important intermedium which drives the operations and processes between 
the supply chain members. Supply chain flow element involves the three exchanging flow 
items: information flow, material flow and financial flow. 
 Information Flow 
The information flow in the supply chain model has two types: external information flow 
and internal information flow. The external information flow is defined as the interactive 
processes between the supply chain members. The external information involves customer 
forecast information, purchasing order, shipping notice etc. The internal information flow is 
defined as the operation process within each supply chain member and involves manufactur-
ing information, planning decision information etc. 
indicate the internal process of each supply chain member identified by the supply chain struc-
ture element in the phase 1. 
 
Step1: Identify Supply Chain Members 
First, the supply chain members must be chosen since the supply chain system is com-
prised by many different members. The functions of each member should be identified as 
shown in the Fig. 4. 
 
Fig. 4. Identify supply chain members and their functions 
Step2: Define Supply Chain Basic Data 
Secondly, the basic data provided by the supply chain data element such as product data 
and its attributes, BOM table and BOD table should be identified as shown in Fig. 5. From 
these data, we can understand which supply chain member produces, distributes or stores 
which product or material. 
Step3: Define Supply Chain Planning Data 
There are planning activities for each supply chain member. In the step, the related plan-
ning data must be defined. The planning data shown in Table 1 involves the planning parame-
ters (planning period, planning horizon), the supply information, the demand information and 
the balance method. The planning activities include the supply chain planning, material re-
quirement planning, master production planning and distribution planning. 
Table 1.  Material requirement planning table 
 
Step4: Define Process Activity and Its Relationship 
In this step, the activities of each process and the relationship of each activity are identi-
fied. The supply chain process can be classified into two types, executing process and plan-
ning process according to the SCOR Level 3. The process activity identification involves 
three following parts. 
(1) Identify the activity of  SCOR-based executing process 
Although the supply chain structure element in the phase1 have defined the rough execut-
ing function of each supply chain member such as source, make or deliver, each function is 
comprised of many activities. Therefore, we based on the SCOR level 3 model to identify the 
activities of each function. For the example, the “Source (S1)” function involve “Schedule 
Product Deliver (S1.1)” activity, “Receive Product (S1.2)” activity, “Transfer Product (S1.3)” 
activity, and “Authorize Supplier Payment (S1.4)” activity. Besides, the relation between each 
function is also identified as the executing process as shown in Fig. 5. 
(2) Identify the activity of  SCOR-based planning process 
4 SCOR-based Supply Chain Simulation Object Design & 
Implementation 
In this section, we combine UML diagram and object-oriented simulation technology to pro-
pose a development procedure for designing and implementing SCOR-based supply chain 
simulation object. The development procedure shown in Fig. 8 consists of three phases: (1) 
analysis phase, (2) design phase, and (3) implement phase. The analysis phase uses the use 
case provided by UML to represent the operation process in the supply chain and identify the 
objects (or components) which is included in the each process. The design phase will identify 
the interactive relationship between each object provided by the analysis phase through the 
structural and behavior modeling. The final phase, implement phase, we use the commercial 
object-oriented simulation software, eM-Plant & ARIS, to implement the SCOR-based supply 
chain simulation objects. 
 
Fig. 8. A development procedure of SCOR-based supply chain simulation object 
4.1   Analysis Phase 
The analysis phase will describe the operation process in the supply chain such as material 
flow or information flow and the identify objects which is included in the each process 
through the use case diagram. 
 Component Definition Analysis—Use Case Diagram 
The purpose of use case diagram shown in Fig. 10 is not only to indicate the scope of the 
supply chain system and to describe the process in the supply chain. The use case diagram can 
also use to verify and validate the correction of simulation model. The Fig. 9 shows the use 
case diagram of the MPS planning and Capacity-Constrain MPS process. The following steps 
depict how to draw the use case diagram. 
Step1: Identify actors 
Step2: Identify use case 
Step3: Identify flow of events 
ject, or table object. We can hierarchically design the new object through duplicating, deriving 
and combining the basic objects as show in Fig. 11. The following steps provide the reference 
to design and implement the supply chain simulation object. 
Step1: Identify the supply chain simulation object which wants to design 
Step2: Identify the used basic object from the object-oriented simulation software 
Step3: Identify the attributes of used basic object 
Step4: Construct the connecting relationship between the basic objects through duplicating, 
deriving and combining the basic objects or the interface 
Step5: Identify the operation logic method between the basic objects 
Step6: Adopt the bottom up to develop the supply chain simulation object hierarchically

5   Conclusion 
In order to design and evaluate a suitable supply chain operation model through the SCOR 
model and simulation techniques, this research develops a design methodology for developing 
SCOR-based supply chain simulation. The design methodology combines the three techniques: 
(1) common supply chain process language- SCOR model, (2) object-oriented modeling-UML 
and (3) object-oriented simulation software- eM-Plant. The methodology includes three 
phases: SCOR-based supply chain simulation modeling framework, SCOR-based supply 
chain process definition, and SCOR-based supply chain simulation object design & imple-
mentation.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Hopp and Spearman [1] propose that the capacity planning 
must consider how much and what type of capacity to install 
and have a major impact on all other production planning 
issues (e.g., aggregate planning, demand management, 
sequencing and scheduling). Additionally, when capacity 
decision makers have decided to add capacity, there are several 
issues to address: (1) how much and when should capacity be 
added? (2) what type of capacity should be added? (3) where 
should additional capacity be added? 
Liang and Chou [2] and Chou et al. [3] classify the capacity 
planning tasks into three levels by their planning horizon. In the 
long term, the objective of capacity planning is to prepare for 
plant transition in anticipation of new process technology and 
new product and to support strategic plans of business. In the 
medium term, capacity can be changed by tool purchase and 
decommission. It should be noted that capacity is expanded in 
small increments, by gradually populating the factory with 
more machines. Capacity planning in this time frame is mainly 
a tool portfolio configuration problem. In the short-term, the 
overall capacity is largely fixed, but with some room for 
adjustment through equipment set-up change-over (i.e., 
alternative routing). Therefore, capacity planning problems are 
mainly about capacity allocation among job orders and 
alternative routing planning. 
Based on different production environments, the capacity 
planning problems discussed in literature can be categorized 
into three major categories: single-site capacity planning, 
multi-site capacity planning without new site installation and 
multi-site capacity planning with new site installation (or called 
supply chain network design). 
Through purchasing, renting, transferring or replacing new 
machines or auxiliary tools, single-site capacity planning 
problems focus on determining the best resource investigation 
for allocating and expanding the capacity of a particular site to 
meet required demands. Li and Tirupati [4] constructed a multi-
product dynamic investment model to make technology 
selections and expansion decisions in a single production 
facility. Rajagopalan [5] unified the equipment replacement 
and capacity expansion research by developing a general model 
which considers the capacity for replacement as well as 
expansion. Rajagopalan and Swaminathan [6] developed a 
mathematical programming model as an effective solution to 
determine the optimal capacity expansion, production and 
inventory decisions. Wang and Lin [7], Wang and Hou [8], and 
Wang et al. [9] made preliminary studies on a capacity 
allocation and expansion problem with tool investments (such 
as test machines or handlers) in a semiconductor testing facility.  
Uribe et al. [10] indicate that the main issue in capacity 
planning is to decide the amount of investment and the 
selection of resource to use. Their research formulates capacity 
planning problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program in 
which the first stage characterizes the optimal response under 
uncertainties and the second stage selects a tool set based on 
the characterization from the first stage. Zhang et al. [11] 
introduce a capacity planning problem with reconfigurable kits 
in an Intel assembly facility using MILP methods.  
For the multiple sites capacity planning without new site 
installation, most literatures focus on how to meet future 
demands through expanding the capacity of existing sites to 
minimize total costs or maximize total profits. Papageorgiou et 
al.[12] proposes mixed-integer linear programming model to 
formulate a capacity planning and investment problem for the 
manufacturing network of the pharmaceutical industry. Yilmaz 
and Catay [13] address a strategic planning problem for a three-
stage production–distribution network. They formulated this 
problem as a 0-1 mixed integer programming model and three 
LP-relaxation heuristics are developed. 
The multiple sites capacity planning with new site 
installation simultaneously integrate manufacturing network 
design/ facility location and capacity planning problems to 
address three issues: (1) what are the optimal product mixes 
and production quantities across multiple factories? (2) what 
capacity expansion method should be adopted to meet 
unsatisfied demands through expanding the capacity of existing 
sites or building a new site? and (3) where new site should be 
opened and how much capacity should be installed in the new 
site under the new site installation? These problems are also 
called capacitated facility location and strategic supply chain 
network design in the literature. 
Lim and Kim [14] consider a dynamic capacitated plant 
location problem in which capacities of opened plants are 
determined by acquisition and/or disposal of multiple types of 
facility including flexible facilities and dedicated facilities. 
MirHassani et al. [15] develop a two-stage resource allocation 
to investigate a strategic capacity planning problem for supply 
chain under demand uncertainties. The first stage strategic 
decisions are concerned with the opening and closing of sites 
and distribution centers and setting their capacity levels. The 
second stage operational decisions, such as production 
quantities and transportation amounts represent recourse 
actions when demands are revealed. Ayuso et al. [16] present a 
two-stage stochastic 0-1 modeling and a related algorithm for 
supply chain management under uncertainty, whose goal 
consists of determining the production topology, plant sizing, 
product selection, production allocation among plants. Santoso 
et al. [17] develop a practical methodology for two real supply 
chain network design problems under uncertainty and highlight 
the significance of the stochastic model as well as the 
efficiency of the proposed solution strategy. 
From the studies we have surveyed on capacity planning 
issues, little attention has been directed to the auxiliary tools 
purchasing strategy. In this paper, the capacity allocation 
planning and expansion policy problem in the TFT-LCD 
industry is explored. 
III. THE CAPACITY ALLOCATION AND EXPANSION MODEL 
A. Categorization of capacity planning 
(a). Categorization by the planning horizon 
According the planning horizon, the capacity planning can 
be categorized into three classes. These are long-term, mid-
term and short-term. The main purpose of long-term capacity 
planning is to increase the overall capacity. It involves an 
analysis of the decision on whether to build new factories or 
not. In terms of the level of capacity planning, this belongs to

The objective of the strategic supply chain planning process 
is to maximize the long-term economic performance of the 
corporation. This objective has to be expressed in the financial 
performance measures. In this paper, the primary performance 
measure is the net present value (NPV) of the streams of net 
cash flows (NCF).

Constraint (2) indicate demand quantities in the current 
period t is less and equal to total sales quantities which equal to 
release production quantities multiplied by the economic 
cutting ratio and yield rate. Constraint (3) describes total 
production quantities of each site is less and equal to the 
available global capacity of each site. Constraints (4) and (5) 
represent the available capacity constraint of each site and each 
product group in the each period. Since the number of the 
auxiliary tools for each product is limited, the available 
capacity of each product group is different at the each site in 
the each period.  
Constraint (6) is to decide whether the site i can expand the 
capacity of the product group k in period t or not. If eaik=1, the 
site i can purchase the new auxiliary tool of product group k to 
expand its capacity. If eaik=0, the site i can not expand the 
capacity of product group k. Here, we define Mikt=ebikt/euik. 
Constraint (7) indicates the capacity expansion upper bound 
caused by the limitation of bottleneck resource.  
Constraint (8) represents the budget limit for procuring new 
auxiliary tools. Constraints (9) and (10) are the financial 
operation constraints. When the depreciation is subtracted from 
the net sales, we have earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). 
Then after considering the interest and tax rate, net cash flows 
(NCF) at the end of time period t can be acquired. In this paper, 
the overall net profits are equal to total contribution margins 
minus total apportioned capacity investment costs. The total 
apportioned capacity investment costs are calculated by linear 
depreciation method. For example, the new auxiliary tool is 
purchased in time period t and will be available after the 
procurement lead time elik. The specific product type k is 
expected to phase-out in time period phk. The estimated life of 
the new auxiliary tool is equal to phk –t+1–elik. If T is less than 
the estimated phase-out time phk, the usable life time of the 
auxiliary tool until the end of planning horizon T is is T–t+1–
elik. If T is greater than the estimated phase-out time phk, the 
usable life time of the auxiliary tool until the end of planning 
horizon T is is phk–t+1–elik. Therefore, within the planning
