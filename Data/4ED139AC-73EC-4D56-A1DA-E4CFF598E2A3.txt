2 Materials and methods
Strain and inoculum preparation
Organism Mucor rouxii BCRC 30546 was
obtained from the Culture Collection and
Research Center (BCRC), Food Industry
Research and Development Institute (Hsinchu,
Taiwan). The strain was maintained on
potato-dextrose-agar slant for the
sporangiospore preparation. The spores were
harvested by the addition of sterile water to the
5th day culture. The spore suspension was then
filtered through a sintered glass funnel.
Batch culture in shake flasks
Shake flask cultures were carried out in
250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of
medium. The media were made up of glucose
20 g, corn steep solid 3g in l liter RO water. and
sterilized at 121°C for 20 min. The initial pH
was adjusted to 4 by addition of 1N NaOH and
without control. A set of experiments were
performed with various additives in order to
investigate the influence of additives on the
morphology and growth rate of mycelia. The
flasks were inoculated with 10% (v/v) of the
inoculum and incubated at 30°C in a rotary
shaker at 150 rpm for several days. The data of
shake flask cultures presented in this study
were mean values of triplicate tests.
Biomass determination and l ipid extraction
Mycelia and yeast-like cells of M. rouxii
were harvested by filtering the cultures through
filter paper (Whatman no. 1) and
centrifugation, respectively. The cells were
freeze dried. Cell growth was determined by
measuring the dry weight of biomass. The dried
cells were then used directly for the lipid and
fatty acid analyses. Biomass was disrupted and
homogenised in a pestle and mortar using
acid washed sand (1:2 ratio). The fungal
biomass liid was extracted with chloroform:
methanol (2:1) for 1 h. The extracted lipid
was centrifuged to obtain a clear supernatant
and anhydrous sodium sulphate was added
to remove any residual moisture. The solvent
was removed by flushing with nitrogen and
the total lipid estimated by a gravimetric
method. All values were means of triplicate
determinations.
Fatty acid determination
The fatty acid profile of the lipid of
mycelium was determined by saponifying
followed by methylation for conversion of
fatty acids to fatty acid methyl esters
(FAMES). FAMES were prepared according
to the method of Morrison and Smith and
analysed in a Shimadzu 17A Gas
Chromatograph (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with
a flame ionization detector. Separation was
carried out on a SPTM 2330 capillary column
(SUPELCO, U.S.A.) (30 m × 0.32 mm). The
operating conditions were column
temperature 190C, injection temperature
250 C, detector temperature 280 C.
Nitrogen was used as carrier at a flow rate of
1.5 ml/min. Individual fatty acids were
identified with the retention times of
authentic fatty acid standards (palmitic acid,
stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and
GLA) obtained from Sigma Co., USA.
Relative amounts of fatty acids were calculated
from their chromatographic peak areas. All
values were means of triplicate
determinations.
3 Results and discussion
The effect of time
The time course of fungal growth and
lipid production in a flask culture are shown in
Fig. 1, which were obtained with 100 ml of
medium at an initial pH of 5.0 and a
temperature of 30C in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer
flask. As shown in Fig. 1, cell growth increased
rapidly at the early stage and the maximum
concentration reached 5.6 g(D.W.)/L on the 4th
day. At the same time, GLA content and
cellular lipid content also rose to the highest
levels of 0.086 g/L and 21.6 %, respectively.
Since the carbon source (glucose) had been
depleted on the 4th day, the growth ceased and
the concentration decreased gradually. This
type of production is caled “growth 
associated”. It is worthy to note that both cel 
concentration and enzyme activity then
process development of .large scale
production.
