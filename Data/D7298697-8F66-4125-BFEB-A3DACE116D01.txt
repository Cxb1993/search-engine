二、英文摘要 
In this project, we complete all subject. We consider 
the problem of adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control of 
uncertain nonlinear singularly perturbed (UNSP) systems 
with guaranteed ∞H  control performance. Firstly, we 
use Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to construct the 
uncertain singularly perturbed fuzzy (USPF) systems. 
Secondly, we propose the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode 
design to stabilize the UNSP systems. The proposed 
methods are based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. The 
adaptive law can reduce the effect of uncertainty. The 
sliding surface and the allowable perturbation bound *ε  
can be determined via linear matrix inequality (LMI) 
design procedure such that the proposed adaptive fuzzy 
sliding mode control will stabilize the UNSP systems for 
all ),0( *εε ∈ . An example is adopted to demonstrate the 
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control 
scheme. 
 
Index Terms—Adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control, linear 
matrix inequality, Lyapunov stability theorem, uncertain 
nonlinear singularly perturbed system. 
三、緣由與目的 
The theorem of singularly perturbed (SP) control 
systems have been intensively studied for the past four 
decades; see literature [1-2] and the references therein. SP 
systems often occurred at the physical systems in 
engineering field, such as motor control system, electronic 
circuits, magnetic-ball suspension system, and so on such 
that the methodology of singular perturbation has been a 
popular tool for system analysis and controller synthesis. 
Recently, there have appeared a number of stability 
analysis and stabilization of singular perturbation systems 
and consider the stability bound *ε , see [3-4]. In [3], two 
new approaches including time and frequency domain 
were employed to solve the maximal stability bound *ε . 
In [4], based on the frequency domain representation, a set 
of new stability bound was derived for the stability of SP 
systems. These stability criteria can be easily verified by 
computing certain singular values within finite frequency 
intervals. However, all these stabilization bound problems 
are dealing with the linear singular perturbation systems. 
During the past two decades, a number of papers 
have been presented to deal with fuzzy logic and its 
applications [5-13]. There have been rapidly growing 
interest in T-S type fuzzy models; see [5-13]. The theory 
of LMIs [14] has been widespread used as a tool in order 
to solve the stability of T-S fuzzy model. In this type of 
fuzzy model, linear models represent local dynamics in 
different state space regions. The overall model of the 
system is achieved by fuzzy blending of these linear 
models. Nonlinear control approaches based on the T-S 
fuzzy model have been also successfully developed in the 
framework of LMI designs [5-13]. 
Recently, many researchers focus on the ∞H  
control design for SP systems, nonlinear singularly 
perturbed (NSP) systems and nonlinear systems [7, 9, 
10-11, 15]. The objective of ∞H  attenuation control 
design is to restrain the influence of external disturbances. 
For SP fuzzy systems, [9] considered the problem of 
designing a ∞H  fuzzy controller with pole placement 
constraints for a class of NSP systems. Where, a ∞H  
fuzzy controller is provided to guarantee the 2L -gain of 
the mapping from the exogenous input noise to the 
regulated output is less than a prescribed value and the 
closed-loop poles of each local system are stable within a 
prespecified region. 
    The applications of sliding mode control have been 
found in the literature [16-19]. But, for the sliding mode 
control application to UNSP systems and USPF systems 
case is still an open research problem. In this paper, we 
adopt T-S fuzzy model to construct UNSP systems. The 
adaptive sliding mode fuzzy controller is proposed to 
stabilize the UNSP systems with optimal ∞H  control 
performance. A numerical example is given to examine 
the proposed method.

Secondly, the sliding surface (5) can be rearranged as the 
following form,

To prove the main result, the following Assumption 
is necessary.

where ft  is terminal time of control, 0>β  and 
ασσ −=~ . Then, a sufficient condition for stabilization of 
the UNSP system (1) under the adaptive fuzzy sliding 
mode controller is established in the following theorem.

Therefore, we have [ ]114.464.40=F . From 
Assumption 2 and equation (18), one can choose 
95.4=α , 001.01 =k , 160002 =k  , 9903 =k  and 
155=β . To examine the validity, we apply the fuzzy 
sliding mode controller and the adaptive law which is 
defined in (17) to the original UNSP system (23). 
Simulation results of the states under the initials 
5.0)0(1 =x , 5.0)0(2 −=x  and 2.0)0( =z  with 6.3=ε  
and 05.4=ε  are shown in Figure 1. Obviously, the 
resulting controller stabilizes the UNSP system (23).

七、結論 
A new method has been proposed to stabilize the 
UNSP systems. The fuzzy sliding mode controller and 
adaptive control law have been provided to stabilize the 
UNSP systems with guaranteed ∞H  control performance. 
Firstly, the sliding surface and the allowable perturbation 
bound *ε  can be determined via linear matrix inequality 
(LMI) design procedure. Secondly, the proposed adaptive 
fuzzy sliding mode control will stabilize the UNSP 
systems for all ),0( *εε ∈ . The effect of external 
disturbance on control performance has been attenuated to 
a minimum level. A DC motor driven inverted pendulum 
system has been given to illustrate the modeling and 
design procedure. The simulation result demonstrates the 
proposed scheme is feasible and satisfactory.
