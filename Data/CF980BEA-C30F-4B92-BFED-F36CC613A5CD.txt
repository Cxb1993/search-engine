ABSTRACT 
A multiple discharging wires in the particle charger has been tested to improve the 
extrinsic charging efficiency of nanoparticles employing sheath air. The applied 
voltage of the charger ranged from +4.0 to +10 kV. The performance of the particle 
charger with multiple discharging wires has been investigated at different sheath flow 
rates, corona voltages and sheath air velocities. Results revealed that the optimal 
efficiency of the multiple discharging wires in the particle charger can be reached at 
20 L/min sheath air flow rate, +9 kV applied voltage and 10 L/min aerosol flow rate. 
The extrinsic charging efficiency of the multiple discharging wires in the charger 
increases from 2.9 % to 86 % for the particle diameter ranging from 2.5 to 50 nm. The 
charge distributions in the exit of the multiple discharging wires in the charger were 
also determined for the optimal operating condition.

them away from the wall of the charger and minimizing charged particle loss. 
However, in this design, the effect of AC field was less useful to charge particles 
efficiently and reduce loss. After that, other Hewitt type chargers were still proposed 
to reduce the charged particles loss (Kruis and Fissan 2001; Biskos et al. 2005). In 
these studies, the extrinsic charging efficiency achieved was about 30 % for 10 nm 
positive charged particles in the study of the former, 25 % and 60 % for 10 nm and 20 
nm positively charged particles in the research of the latter, respectively. However, 
Marquard et al. (2006 a) concluded that chargers by using an AC field to bring ions 
colliding particles could not improve the compromise between the average charge and 
loss for ultrafine particles. 
Since most bipolar chargers might have the low extrinsic charging efficiency due 
to charging and discharging mechanism. Chen and Pui (1999) designed a unipolar 
charger with the parallel configuration of aerosol flow and ion current. A relatively 
weak electrical field was applied to keep the same polarity ions with aerosols and 
collect the opposite polarity ions from a 210Po radioactive source. They implemented 
sheath air surrounding the aerosol flow to keep charged particles in a core region for 
avoiding electrostatic loss. Thus, the extrinsic charging efficiency was found as high 
as 22 % for 3 nm positively charged particles based on flux efficiency. However, the 
use of radioactive material needs to consider the tight safety regulations and the 
relatively high cost. Charging aerosols with unipolar ions produced by corona 
discharging is therefore an alternative technique. 
Sierra et al. (2003) proposed a corona charger of needle inside a tube. The corona 
discharge takes place around a sharp-point stainless steel electrode, and aerosols 
collide directly with unipolar ions. They demonstrated good performance of a corona 
ionizer in charging nanoparticle. Latter on, Alonso et al. (2006) and Qi et al. (2008)

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEWS 
Particle chargers can be divided into two kinds by means of bipolar charging or 
unipolar charging. For bipolar charging, simultaneously taking place, two competing 
processes, charging and neutralizing, lead to low charging efficiency: 4 % for 
positively charging 10 nm particles and 6 % for negatively charged particles (Reischl 
et al. 1996). In other words, more than 90 % nanoparticles would be lost during the 
classification process inside DMA.  
In order to improve the charging efficiency of nanoparticles, many of scholars 
have designed several particle chargers. Chen and Pui (1999 ) reviewed the studies on 
unipolar charging technique such as Liu and Pui (1977), Büscher et al. (1994), 
Wiedensoler et al. (1994), Adachi et al. (1985), Adachi et al. (1990) and Romay and 
Pui (1992) (as listed in Table 2.1). However, only small fraction of the charged 
nanoparticle was obtainable in the unipolar chargers due to high electrostatic loss 
within the charger. Several types of unipolar chargers had been proposed and tested 
for a long period. Only small fraction of charged was obtainable in unipolar chargers 
accounting to high electrostatic loss within charger. Early days, Wiedensohler et al. 
(1994) firstly used an alternative electric field in the charging region to overcome the 
particle loss to the walls. The bipolar ions were generated by radioactive source Cm244, 
placed in two opposite boxes. An alternative electric field was applied between screen 
openings near each box to draw unipolar ions into charging zones at the center. The 
charged particles move zigzag manner in this section under the influence of the 
alternative electric field. This change of state has gained 4 % extrinsic charging 
efficiency for 10 nm size particles.  
Chen and Pui (1999) have designed a unipolar charger with parallel 
configuration, i.e. aerosol and ion flow parallel. Desirable unipolar ions were 
6 
the highest experimental values of extrinsic charging efficiency for particles below 5 
nm so far.

3.2 Experimental Setup   
Fig. 3.2 shows the experimental setup for the evaluation of the chargers. In the 
charging test system, an additional compressed filtered air was mixed with uncharged 
particles to increase the aerosol flow rate to 10 L/min before entering the charger. In 
the charging zone, a sheath air flow could be introduced from the 0.1 mm or 0.5 mm 
annular slit along the inner wall of the charger. After charged aerosol flow exited 
outside the charger, it passed through the second ESP. The charged aerosol flow was 
further introduced into an ultrafine condensation particle counter (UCPC, TSI model 
3786) to measure particle concentration downstream of the charger. When DC voltage 
is applied, the stainless steel casing was connected to a picoammeter (Keithley Model 
6485) which is grounded to measure the corona current. The corona current I versus 
the corona voltage V could be therefore measured. Due to the low concentration of 
monodisperse particle which the size is less than 3 nm, we used polydisperse 
uncharged particle ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 nm as an alternative method to evaluate the

In this study, both charging efficiencies and losses of unipolar charger with 
multiple discharging wires were measured. There are four indexes used for evaluating 
the charging performance of unipolar chargers, including intrinsic charging efficiency 
(ηint), extrinsic charging efficiency (ηext), electrostatic loss (Lel), and diffusion loss 
(L0d), which are calculated by the expressions described similar to the criteria of

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 Relationship between Ion Current and Corona Voltage 
The Nit product is a basic index to describe the operation of a corona aerosol 
charger; it is the key parameter in charging by ion diffusion mechanism. A greater Nit 
product would make sure of the higher intrinsic charging efficiency. The corona 
current, I, varied as applied voltage was measured, and the ion concentration Ni was 
assumed to be related to the corona current. Ni values can be estimated by following 
equation: 
2
1
ln
2i i
rI r
N
V Z L eπ
⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠=  4.1 
 
where 1r  is the radius of the discharging wires; 2r  is the distance between the outer 
casing and discharging wires, iZ is the electrical mobility of positive ions (1.4×10
-4 
m2/V-sec), L is the length of the discharging wires; e is the elementary charge 
(1.6×10-19 C). 
 As shown in Fig. 4.1, the ion current was found as a function of applied positive 
and negative voltage for the charger. When the positive corona voltage increases from 
+4.0 kV to +10 kV, the corona current will increase from 0.02 to 119.63 μA. The ion 
concentration in the charging zone can be controlled by the corona current or the 
corona voltage. That is, an increasing corona voltage can lead to a higher corona 
current, more ions were therefore generated from the surface of the corona wire. It 
results in the possibility of an increasing intrinsic charging efficiency of the unipolar 
charger with multiple discharging wires. 
14 
It demonstrates that higher velocity would shorten the charging time to carry particles 
through the charging zone, so that the intrinsic charging efficiency will be decreased.

FIG. 4.2  Intrinsic charging efficiency as a function of corona voltage for 
different sheath flow rates. 
 
Fig. 4.4 shows the intrinsic charging efficiency of the particles which size 
ranged from 2.5 to 50 nm for the different applied voltages at the sheath flow rate of 
20 L/min. Results show that the intrinsic charging efficiencies increase with 
increasing the corona voltages and particle sizes. However, the intrinsic charging 
efficiency can only display a part of performance of the charger. It is necessary to 
optimize the performance of the charger and to find out the optimal operating 
condition. 
16 
 
4.3 Electrostatic Loss and Diffusion Loss 
When the corona voltages are increased to raise the fraction of charged particles 
and the intrinsic charging efficiencies, it’s important to let the charged particles pass 
through the charger. The fraction of particle loss also needs to be reduced. As seen in 
Fig. 4.5, the electrostatic loss of charged particles due to the deposition by the 
electrical field and space charge exists in the charger at different sheath air flow rates 
and corona voltages. It is evident that an increase in the sheath air flow rate decreases 
the electrostatic loss of charged particles at the same applied voltage in the charger. It 
is because that the sheath air flow can carry the charged particles fast through the 
charging zone, preventing the charged particles from deposited by the strong electrical 
field.  
 
Fig. 4.6 shows the electrostatic loss of charged particles ranged from 2.5 to 50 
nm in particle sizes at different mean velocities of sheath air flow in the charger. The 
most electrostatic loss is seen to occur at 10 nm charged particles. It is due to the 
charged fraction of the particles less than 10 nm decreases with decreasing particle 
diameter, on the other hand, the electrical mobility of the particles greater than 10 nm 
lessens as the particle size increased. The electrostatic loss of the charged particles in 
the charger at other sheath air velocities was found to have the similar results. 
Moreover, the higher mean velocity of sheath air flow can slightly reduce the 
electrostatic loss of the charged particles. 
 
 
 
18 
 
Fig. 4.7 shows the diffusion loss of uncharged particles in the charger at different 
mean velocities of sheath air flow and particle sizes. Compared to the case without 
sheath air flow, the diffusion loss of uncharged particles is smaller for the sheath air 
flow of 20 L/min, due to the shorter residence time in the charger. For the case of 
higher mean velocity of sheath air flow, the diffusion loss of particle size ranged from 
2.5 to 50 nm is close to that of lower mean velocity of sheath air flow. 
 
4.4 Extrinsic Charging Efficiency 
Compared with the intrinsic charging efficiency, the extrinsic charging 
efficiency of the charger with multiple discharging wires is more significant with 
practice. The extrinsic charging efficiency represents the capability of the charger to 
offer charged particles, so it is frequently used to optimize the performance of the 
charger. As shown in Fig. 4.8, it is the extrinsic charging efficiency for 10 nm 
particles in the charger at the different sheath air flow rates and corona voltages. 
There is an optimal extrinsic charging efficiency for the different corona voltages at 
each sheath air flow rate in the charger. In general, the extrinsic charging efficiencies 
of 10 nm particles increase with increasing the sheath flow rate at various corona 
voltages. The highest extrinsic charging efficiency for 10 nm particles is 39.4 % at 
sheath air flow rate of 20 L/min and applied voltage of +9 kV.  
 
 
 
 
 
20 
 
 Fig. 4.9 shows the extrinsic charging efficiency of the particles ranged from 2.5 
to 50 nm for various mean velocities of sheath air flow at the optimal applied voltage. 
A higher mean velocity of sheath air flow can slightly enhance the extrinsic charging 
efficiency at the same sheath air flow rate; it is because those charged particles are 
easier to pass through the charging zone near the wall of the charger. 
 Fig. 4.10 shows the extrinsic charging efficiency of the particles ranged from 2.5 
to 50 nm for the different applied voltages at the sheath flow rate of 20 L/min. Results 
show that the extrinsic charging efficiency increases as the particle size increases. In 
addition, the higher extrinsic charging efficiency can be obtained with a sufficiently 
high discharging voltage at an appropriate sheath air flow rate and mean sheath air 
velocity. The best extrinsic charging efficiency of 2.86 to 86.3 % for particles ranging 
from 2.5 to 50 nm is seen to occur at +9.0 kV in the charger with multiple discharging 
wires.  
Comparing with the maximum extrinsic charging efficiency attainable in 
previous chargers, as shown in Fig. 4.11, the present charger is higher than the others 
for the particles less than 10 nm. This study demonstrates that the charger operating at 
20 L/min sheath air flow rate and +9kV applied voltage has the optimal extrinsic 
charging efficiency. There are about 30 % electrostatic loss and 5 % diffusion loss for 
10 nm particles, and electrostatic loss of 19 % and diffusion loss of 9.4 % for particles 
of 5 nm in the charger. Therefore, it is efficient to reduce the particle loss by using the 
sheath air flow rate at an appropriate discharging voltage to enhance the extrinsic 
charging efficiency of the charger with multiple discharging wires.

4.5 Measured Particle Charge Distribution 
 Beside the extrinsic charging efficiency, the charge distribution of particles 
passing through the charger with multiple discharging wires is necessary to obtain for 
many practical applications. In this study, the charge distributions in the exit of the 
charger for the particles with different sizes were measured. Fig. 4.12 shows the 
charge distribution for the particles of 5, 10, 20 and 50 nm in the exit of the charger at 
20 L/min sheath flow rate and +9 kV applied voltage. The results demonstrate that the 
particles are singly charged or uncharged for the particle diameter smaller than 10 nm. 
For larger particles, the fraction of multiply charged particles is found to be higher. 
24 
the extrinsic charging efficiency was found to vary with the optimal value obtained at 
20 L/min. The mean velocity of sheath air flow near the tube wall slightly enhanced 
the extrinsic charging efficiency by reducing little electrostatic loss. The optimal 
operational condition for particles of 2.5~50 nm in diameter with the highest extrinsic 
charging efficiency of 2.86~86.3 % in the charger was obtained at +9 kV corona 
voltage, 10 L/min aerosol flow, and 20 L/min sheath air flow. The TDMA technique 
was further utilized to analyze the charge distribution in the exit of particles. The 
results show that the particles are singly charged or uncharged for diameter smaller 
than 10 nm. For particles larger than 20 nm, the fraction of multiply charged particles 
becomes higher. 
 
4.7 Evaluation  
This study has finished the determination of the charging efficiency of the 
multiple-wire nanoparticle charger under various operation parameters. The best 
condition for operating the multiple-wire nanoparticle charger has also been obtained. 
Results of this project are suitable for submitting to the international journal paper.

1. Introduction  
Researchers found that unipolar charging is more efficient than bipolar ions for 
charging nanoparticles. The varied unipolar charging methods are expected to achieve 
higher charging efficiency of nanoparticles. Experimental data of charging efficiency for 
nanoparticles under 10nm have been reported by Buscher et al. (1994) using corona 
discharge and Wiedensohler et al. (1994), who used a radioactive source 224Cm to 
generate bipolar ions in two boxes separated by central charging region and an alternative 
electric field to draw unipolar ions into charging zone. The AC electrical field moved 
charged particles in a zigzag manner, keeping them away from the wall of the charger 
and minimizing charged particle loss. However, in this design, the effect of AC field was 
less useful to charge particles efficiently and reduce loss. After that, other Hewitt type 
chargers were still proposed to reduce the charged particles loss (Kruis and Fissan 2001; 
Biskos et al. 2005). In these studies, the extrinsic charging efficiency achieved was about 
30 % for 10 nm positive charged particles in the study of the former, 25 % and 60 % for 
10 nm and 20 nm positively charged particles in the research of the latter, respectively. 
However, Marquard et al. (2006 a) concluded that chargers by using an AC field to bring
