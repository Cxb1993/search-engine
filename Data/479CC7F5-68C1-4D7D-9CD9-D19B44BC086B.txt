period. This study aims at examining the hydro-
mechanical behavior of slope during rainfall-
infiltration process. The method of study is via 
numerical analysis with input parameters such as 
water coefficient of permeability obtained indirectly 
from the soil-water retention characteristics curve 
via the pressure-plate extractor test. The model was 
first calibrated against a laboratory modeled slope 
test subjected to rainfall. In addition, this study 
utilizes the Maokong T16 pillar down slope landslide 
as a case study for the investigation of its 
triggering mechanism. The outcome of this research 
can be used to evaluate potential landslide disaster

2 THEORETICAL FORMULATIONS
Ampt (Green & Ampt, 1911) infiltration model
and infinite slope stability model to estimate the
reoccurrence time of road side slope failure during
typhoon in Taiwan and concluded that the model
is acceptable to be applied for estimating the time
of failure and depth of sliding surface of a slope.
However, these studies mainly examined the be-
havior of the slopes using a two-stage approach:
(1) analyze the infiltration and the ground water
flow to obtain the distribution of pore water pres-
sure in the slopes; and (2) analyze the stability of
the slopes using the pore water pressure profile ob-
tained in (1). However, coupled hydro-mechanical
effect were not considered in their studies.
Conventional method of slope stability analy-
sis, which only gives the value of factor of safety,
is insufficient for today’s understanding of land-
slide behavior because the occurrence of landslides
is seldom caused by a single factor but is based
on complex interaction of different factors: field
stress path (drying and wetting), geological and
hydrological conditions, extent of weathering, to-
pography, etc, which vary with location (Broms
and Wong, 1991). In particular, increasing satu-
ration during infiltration along with the suction
reduction depends on the water retention char-
acteristics or soil-water characteristic of the soil.
The degree of saturation determines the soil per-
meability, which affects the flux into the unsat-
urated medium. In addition, suction also has
an influence on the mechanical responses, shear
strength and volumetric of the material. Volu-
metric variation can in turn change the hydraulic
properties (permeability and water retention char-
acteristics) of the soil. Increasing emphasis is be-
ing placed on reliable forecasting of the behavior
of the landslides such as velocity and the time to
failure of a slope and on the understanding and
modeling failure initiation and landslide propaga-
tion. This study aims at deriving and perform-
ing landslide analysis that coupled the two in-
terconnected components–hydraulic behavior and
mechanical behavior of material in both saturated
and unsaturated conditions.
2 Theoretical Formulations
From the concept of effective stress, pore-water
pressure changes due to seepage will lead to
changes in the effective stress and hence the de-
formation in an unsaturated soil. Likewise, stress
changes will alter the porosity, permeability and
water storage capacity of unsaturated soil and
therefore the seepage process. Hence, stress-
deformation and seepage in unsaturated soils are
closely related. Limit equilibrium methods have
been used to evaluate the stability of slopes, how-
ever, the methods disregard the effect of stress-
deformation and seepage on the behavior of the
slopes studied. For a more meaningful, and per-
haps, correct evaluation of the behavior of de-
formable unsaturated soil slopes under rainfall
condition, the effect of stress-deformation and
seepage changes should be simultaneously con-
sidered. A coupled hydro-mechanical numerical
model is required for the study of the performance
of soil slopes during rainfall.
The seepage and deformation of unsaturated soil
slope under isothermal conditions require the cou-
pled solution of the governing equations describing
the equilibrium of the soil structure and the mass
flow of the water phrase (Fredlund & Rahardjo,
1993). Constitutive relationships for the solid and
water are also required. Their coupled formulation
for seepage and deformation in unsaturated soil is
used here in this study.
2.1 Constitutive relationships for soil
structure and water phase
Two stress state variables–net normal stress (σ −
ua) and matric suction (ua−u)w)–are used to de-
scribe the volume change behavior of a soil, where
σ is the total normal stress, ua and uw is the pore-
air and pore-water pressures, respectively.
2.1.1 Soil structure constitutive relationship
Assuming the soil behaves as an isotropic incre-
mentally elastic material, the soil structure stress-
strain relationships associated with the normal
strains can be written in an incremental form as

2.2 Flow law of water
The flow of water in saturated and unsaturated
soil system can be described by Darcy’s law
(Childs and Collis-George 1950):
qi = −ki ∂∂xi
(

γw
+ y
)
(10)
where qi = flow rate in i-direction; ki = coefficient
of permeability of pore-water in i-direction; γw =
unit weight of water; y = elevation.
2.3 Basic equations of physics
2.3.1 Equilibrium equations
The force equilibrium equation for soil structure
of an unsaturated soil is:
σij,j + bi = 0 (11)
where σij = the net total stress tensor; and bi =
body force vector.
2.3.2 Water continuity equation
The equation of water mass conservation in 3-D
flow condition is:
qi,i = −∂θw

(12)
where t = time.

in a simpler expression of the equation:

4 Verification of formulation
4.1 Background of the verification case
The verification study is an infinite slope overly-
ing bedrock that cut through the toe of the slope
(Fig 1a). This sort of slope geometrical and ge-
ological configurations is commonly encountered
along the expressways on the island. A model
slope had been prepared and tested in the labora-
tory by Lan (2008). The 30o model slope was 0.44
m thick and 2.5 m long while the width of the slope
was 1.0 m. The model slope was prepared using
hand pluviation of sandy-silt (SM), which has an
initial gravimetric water content of about 5%. The
model slope was instrumented with 5 numbers of
piezometers for pore-water pressure measurement,
26 numbers of TDR (time domain reflectometer)
for measuring changes of water content in the slope
and 10 numbers of double-axial load cells for mea-
suring the vertical stresses of the soil. All these
sensors were connected to a Yokogawa DC100 data
logger through the RS232C connector (Lan, 2008).
4.2 Input parameters
Since mw1 , m
s
1 and m
s
2 are very small, they are as-
sumed to be zero here, hence Eq 22 reveals that
three characteristic functions (SWCC, hydraulic
conductivity and water storage) are needed for
analysis of the verification study.
4.2.1 SWCC
The experimental SWCC data of the study soil
had been obtained from the sand column test,
which was conducted in a 30 cm (L) × 30 cm (W)
× 35 cm (H) sand box. The initial water content
of the soil was 5%. A constant hydraulic head of
1 cm was continuously supplied at the surface of
the sand box until the whole soil column was satu-
rated. Tensiometer and TDR were used to obtain
the relation between water content and matric suc-
tion (Fig 1b). The figure shows that the saturated
volumetric water content θs for the SM material
was 42.9%. The data was fitted, with the fitting
parameters a = 0.2614, n = 2.65,m = 1− 1/n and
residual volumetric water content θr= 0, using the
function proposed by van Genuchten (1980):
θ = θr +
θs−θr
[1+(aψ)n]m (25)
and a=5.535, n=2.191, and m=1.748 using the
function proposed by Leong and Rahardjo (1997):
θ = θs{ln[exp(1)+{(ψa )n}]}m (26)
4.2.2 Hydraulic Conductivity
Assuming isotropic flow, i.e., kx = ky = kz, for
hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil kw, the
difficult task of measuring this function directly
was overcame by estimating the function from ei-
ther a measured or predicted SWCC function. It
is unnecessary to specify the precise value of hy-
draulic conductivity when computing the distribu-
tion of pore-water pressure; however, if the quan-
tity of flux is a concern, the function must be
specified precisely[7]. For this study, two unsat-
urated hydraulic conductivity functions: Eq 27 of
van Genuchten (1980) and Eq 28 of Leong and Ra-
6/14

hardjo (1997) have been compared and shown in
Fig 2a from the SWCC data shown in Fig 1b:
kw = ksat

]
(27)
kw =
ksat{
n
[
exp(1) +
(

For the above equation, the laboratory measured
saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for the SM
material was 3.6 × 10−5 m/sec. The correspond-
ing fitting parameters a, n and m used in the two
functions were essentially same as the ones used
in fitting the SWCC.
4.2.3 Water Storage
The water storage function mw2 is the gradient of
the SWCC. Hence, after differentiating the SWCC
functions of van Genuchten (1980) and Leong and
Rahardjo (1997), respectively, we obtained the fol-
lowing two water storage functions: Eq 29 of van
Genuchten (1980) and Eq 30 of Leong and Ra-
hardjo (1997)

4.2.4 Rainfall
Taiwan faces high intensity rainfall between May
and October every year, and the stability of many
slopes could be compromised as a result of rainfall
infiltration because the effective stress and, hence,
the strength of the slope will decrease due to the
increase of pore-water pressure generated by ex-
cessive rainfall. Rainfall intensity adopted in Lan
(2008) and this study was 23 mm/hour.
4.2.5 Boundary Conditions
The infinite slope considered was 1.44 m high and
2.5 m long, which gave a slope angle of 30o. The
transient seepage problem requires that initial con-
ditions of head be specified. The initial condition
of the slope was obtained by first solving a steady
state run of the problem in which the body of the
slope was assumed to have an average initial wa-
ter content of 5%. Through Eq 25 or 26 it was
then possible to derive the initial head in the slope.
Three of the four slope boundaries were set to zero
flux condition (Q = 0 in Fig 1a). The results from
the steady state analysis were then used as the
initial condition for the transient analysis where a
rainfall intensity I of 23 mm/hour was assumed to
fall on the surface of the slope.
4.3 Results and Discussion
The above seepage analysis results were evaluated
and plotted here in terms of the distribution of de-
gree of saturation, and time history response of the
volumetric water content. By setting a constant
rainfall intensity of 23 mm/hour, after a period
of 171 minutes and 244 minutes the distribution
of the degree of saturation of the simulated slope
due to rainfall infiltration could be obtained. No
significant variation in the degree of saturation dis-
tribution was observed in the slope during these
periods for both the functions used.
Figs 3a and 4a show the corresponding result ob-
tained by (Lan, 2008) while Figs 3b and 4b show
the degree of saturation distribution obtained us-
ing the van Genuchten’s functions. The distribu-
tion of the degree of saturation near the toe of
the slope was comparable between the simulated
and the model test results. Fig. 3a indicates that
all the rainfall infiltrated into the slope and then
flowed in the direction parallel to the surface of the
slope towards the toe of the slope. The model test
result did not show the same distribution as the
simulated result, probably, due to the lack of data
points used in the interpolation of the contour of
the degree of saturation. The toe of the slope was
the first location to reach 100% saturation. After
244 minutes, the initially almost dry slope was get-
ting wetter and wetter from the base of the slope
(Fig. 4b). The variation in the distribution of the
degree of saturation between Figs 4a and 4b could
be due to the small scarp generated at the toe of
the model slope (Fig. 4a) where the water in the
slope could freely drain away from the toe of the
8/14
5 MAOKONG T16 SLOPE
slope, thus no accumulation of water, as observed
in the simulated result (Fig 4b), was possible.
The time history response of volumetric water
content at the mid level and center of the slope
is presented in Fig 5b. The laboratory rise time
and the maxima of the volumetric water content
at these locations were successfully estimated by
the numerical simulation, albeit the complete pro-
file was not identical. The laboratory obtained
result first reached peak volumetric water content
and then fall to a lower value before rising again.
Such trend was taught to be unreasonable but no
explanation was offered by (Lan, 2008).
5 Maokong T16 Slope
5.1 Background of Maokong T16 slope
In September 2008, within a period of two weeks,
three landslides occurred in the mountainous area
of Taipei city. These landslide were all occurred in
between the Sinlaku and Qiangmi typhoons. Since
these landslides were truly caused by the extreme
climate change and that 55% of the area surround-
ing Taipei city is hillside, it is thus representa-
tive to select one of them to be our case study
to evaluate the usefulness of the above coupled
hydro-mechanical model in back analysing the ex-
treme climate change-induced landslide disaster in
Taipei city. Of the three landslides, the landslide
at the down slope of Maokong cable-car T16 pillar
was closely located was the most devastated one.
The geology of the area is of sedimentary rock,
which is mainly made up of sandstone and shale
or sandstone-shale inter-bed. The slope was cov-
ered by a layer of 2-6 m thick weathered regolith
(Fig 6a). The landslide exposed some of the frac-
tures zone and colluvial soil deposit. The micro-
tremor records recorded by the seismic station lo-
cated at the Zhinan Temple revealed that the sub-
soil at the study site is stiff (Wen et al., 2006). Its
main topography, which is 553.6 m above mean
sea level, can be characterized as rugged and sin-
gle ridge topographies. According to Taipei En-
vironmental Protection Agency, the landslide area
does not belong to the flood plain sensitive area,
however the administrative area of Wenshan has
three potential debris flow streams and its warning
accumulative rainfall criteria is 350 mm. The area
has subtropical climate with an average tempera-
ture of 23.1o and an average humidity of 76.5%.
The average yearly rainfall is 2272.8 mm and av-
erage number of wet days is 156.5 days per year.
The finite element mesh used for the case study is
shown in Fig 6b.
5.2 Input parameters
The three characteristic functions (SWCC, hy-
draulic conductivity and water storage) needed
in this analysis have been derived using the van
Genuchten (1980) functions.
5.2.1 SWCC
The experimental SWCC data of the study soil
had been obtained from the pressure plate extrac-
tor and salt solution tests (Fig 7a). The figure
shows that the saturated volumetric water con-
tent θs for the weathered regolith, a CL material,
was 51.6%. The data was fitted, with the fitting
parameters a = 0.436, n = 1.14,m = 1 − 1/n and
residual volumetric water content θr= 15.5%, us-
ing Eq 25 as proposed by van Genuchten (1980).
5.2.2 Hydraulic Conductivity
The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function
of van Genuchten (1980) have been obtained us-
ing Eq 27 and shown in Fig 7b. For the above
equation, the laboratory measured saturated hy-
draulic conductivity ksat for the CL material was
5.3 × 10−3 m/sec. The corresponding fitting pa-
rameters a, n and m used in the two functions
were essentially same as the ones used in fitting
the SWCC.
5.2.3 Water Storage
The water storage function mw2 is the gradient of
the SWCC. Hence, after differentiating the SWCC
functions of van Genuchten (Eq 25), we obtained
the following two water storage functions as shown
in Fig 8a.
10/14
6 CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
5.2.4 Rainfall
A rainfall analysis based on the data collected at
the Muzha Rainfall Station located a few kilome-
ters away from the study area shows that there
was 3-day antecedent rainfall prior to the occur-
rence of the landslide that occurred on September
28. An accumulated 403 mm of rain was recorded
during the 3-day period (Fig 8b).
5.2.5 Boundary Conditions
The transient seepage problem requires that ini-
tial conditions of head be specified. The initial
condition of the slope was obtained by first solv-
ing a steady state run of the problem in which
the body of the slope was assumed to have initial
suction equaled the negative pore-water pressure
profile in the regolith layer. The water table was
set at the interface between the regolith and the
shale/sandstone bedrock. The left and right ver-
tical boundaries were set to flux condition, where
water was allowed to freely flow into or out of the
boundaries. The bottom boundary of the bedrock
was set to zero flux condition. The results from
the steady state analysis were then used as the
initial condition for the transient analysis where
a daily rainfall intensity (Fig 8b) was assumed to
fall on the surface of the slope.
5.3 Results and Discussion
The above seepage analysis results were evaluated
and plotted here in terms of the distribution of de-
gree of saturation (Figs 9a and 9b). By using the
daily rainfall record shown in Fig 8b, it was found
that during the typhoon Sinlaku (9/14), and on
the day when the landslide occurred during the
typhoon Qiangmi (9/28) the distribution of the
degree of saturation in slope increased drastically
as a result of the intense rainfall. The degree of
saturation in the regolith layer had already been
high, with a minimum degree of saturation of 50%,
because of the Sinlaku typhoon. With the addi-
tional 403 mm of rainfall, the degree of saturation
increased to 100% in almost all parts of the slope.
As such, the landslide was initiated at location
shown in Fig 10a. About 20 centimeters of dis-
placement was seen generated near the top half of
the slope. The simulated location of the initiation
of the landslide coincided with the location of the
initiation of the actual landslide location as shown
by Yang in 2008 (Fig 10b). The simulated land-
slide was however about 30 m smaller than the
actual landslide. This is perhaps caused by the
inhomogeneity of in situ material that has yet to
be taken into account in the above analysis.
6 Conclusions and Suggestions
6.1 Conclusions
A coupled hydro-mechanical analysis has been pre-
sented in this study. The validation of the coupled
hydro-mechanical formulation has been validated
through the simulation of a laboratory modeled
slope. The formulation was then used to simulate
the landslide nearby the Maokong T16 pillar. The
simulated result revealed that rainfall infiltrated
into the slope and caused the whole slope to be
fully saturated on the day when it was collapsed.
The back-analyzed location of the initiation of the
landslide was found to be coincided with the ob-
served location on site.
6.2 Suggestions
Reliable landslide modeling and prediction tools
are especially important for the quantification of
the effects of global climate change scenarios on
landslide hazard and risk as the anticipated stress,
precipitation, and groundwater conditions may be
outside the observed range for a particular region
(Laloui et al., 2010). It is believes that for land-
slide problems a coupled hydro-mechanical model
will allow a better understanding of the slope be-
havior and can simulate failure mechanism accu-
rately. However, the accuracy of the coupled anal-
ysis depends on using realistic boundary condi-
tions and material parameters, which must be de-
termined from the field. It is suggested that the
model incorporate input from continuous landslide
monitoring not only to allow for the understand-
ing of time-dependent behavior of unstable slope

整個會議過程十分順利圓滿，相信與會者對舉辦單位之熱情招待會十分難忘。  
 
與會心得與建議 
首先要感謝國科會對筆者的補助，使筆者得以順利參加此次本次研討會，並發表論文。
此次會議所得到的收獲很多，主要的心得與建議如下： 
 
（一） 參加國際研討會有機會與國外專家學者相互了解彼此之研究心得，透過像 The 
2011 International  Conference on Advances in Structural Engineering and 
Mechanics 的國際研討會會議，在沒有日常的教學與研究等事務干擾下，不僅
能與其他國家跨領域研究之專家學者交流、交換教學與研究之經驗與心得並尋
找共同合作之可能性。 
（二） 筆者認為在準備口頭發表簡報的過程常常會引導自己對本研究課題有更深入的
瞭解，並發掘一些可供後續研究的課題；因此，建議會鼓勵同仁多多參加。
