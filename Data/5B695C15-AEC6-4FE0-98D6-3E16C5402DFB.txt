 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The calculation of the partition function of a Markov random field (MRF) has long been a 
fundamental and difficult problem. To date, there exist only a few special MRF models that 
enjoys an explicit closed form of partition function, e.g., Ising model [1], and mutually 
compatible Markov random field [2]. As for a general Markov random field, an analytical form of 
partition function still remains unavailable today. Due to the huge configuration space, a direct 
computation of partition function is impossible such that, conventionally, the partition function 
was estimated by the so called stochastic simulation algorithms (Monte Carlo methods). There 
have been a number of stochastic simulation algorithms proposed in the literature [3-6]. However, 
as Potamianos [7-9] has remarked: they are all computationally intensive, particularly when 
MRFs on large lattices are considered. The analysis and computation of the partition function are 
important not only of theoretical interest but also of practical use. 
 In a previous work of Huang and Yu [10], this problem was partially answered. They 
proposed a general LEF (local energy function) parameterized Markov random field 
representation, and proved that the asymptotics of partition function (i.e., logarithmic partition 
function per site; or pressure) of a general homogeneous Markov random field can be exactly 
characterized by the Perron root (Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue) )~( )(
q
c
∞Πρ  of an infinite size 
non-negative matrix, which is associated with the transition matrix of a two-dimensional (2-D) 
Markov chain satisfying the compatibility and uniformity conditions.  
This study is the continuing investigation of the work of Huang and Yu [10]. Specifically, this 
paper is aimed at the deterministic calculation of the asymptotics of partition function of a 
general MRF. We shall follow the concepts proposed by Huang and Yu to propose another three 
equivalent forms for the asymptotics of partition function. These four equivalent forms basically 
can be summarized into two distinct formulas with each one having two counterparts using 
column and row setup respectively. We shall follow these two formulas to determine 
approximately the asymptotics of partition function to verify the validity of our theorems. 
 
[13]. All these models have a family of special potential functions parameterized by a few model 
parameters so as to characterize the spatial interaction pattern. 
 
B. General LEF-parameterized Markov Random Field Representation 
Huang and Yu [10] also proposed an alternative representation for the formulation of a 
general Markov random field, i.e., the general LEF (local energy function) parameterized MRF 
representation, which is in fact a modification of the LTF (local transfer function) parameterized 
MRF representation proposed by Goutsias [2,14].  
Proposition 1: Every Markov random field can be generally parameterized in terms of local 
energy function (LEF)

as shown in Fig. 1. It is a re-arrangement of the graph in Fig. 1 by transposing the columns into a row and

Being motivated by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, Huang and Yu introduced the concept of 
equivalence between a 2-D Markov chain and a M'-order 1-D Markov chain as depicted in Fig. 2.

IV. DETERMINISTIC CALCULATION OF THE PARTITION 
FUNCTION 
 
In this section, we shall follow the two approaches, i.e., expressions (15) and (19), to 
calculate the asymptotics of partition function of a general MRF. In this study, they are referred to 
as Method 1 and Method 2 respectively. We shall mainly take the well known Ising model and a 
binary 2nd order MRF as examples to verify the validity of our theorems. 
An important property of a Markov random field is its ability to model phase transitions 
[15,20-21]. A customary way to describe phase transition is to allow the LEF-parameter vector q  
be controlled by the temperature T via q
T
q ′= 1 , and to study the analyticity of the pressure 
)1;( q
T
Zf ′∞  as a function of temperature T. Let )1;()( 2 qTZfTTTI ′∂
∂= ∞  be the internal energy 
and )()( TI
T
TC ∂
∂=  be the specific heat. The phase transition of a MRF occurs when the 
temperature T approaches the critical temperature Tc such that 
+∞=∞→→ )(limlim , TCNMTT c .                          (21) 
In this study, we shall exploit these three quantities (i.e, the pressure, the internal energy, and 
specific heat) as a function of temperature T to evaluate the convergence speed of the two 
proposed methods for deterministic calculation of the partition function. 
Another important issue concerning Method 1 and Method 2 is the computational complexity. 
Due to the sparseness and particular structure of the two matrices, the computational complexity 
shall be reduced.

description, take the case M'=2 (i.e., 
q
cH ) for example. Consider Fig. 2, since M'=2, c ji ),(~Y  is 
composed of two consecutive “random variables by cell”. Let , from (4) and 
(11), we have

accuracy than Method 2 for the same M'. This indicates that Method 1 exhibits a faster 
convergence to the exact partition function than Method 2 for the same M'. However, if the 
comparison is based on the same computational cost, Method 2 obviously outperforms Method 1.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
In addition to the result of Huang and Yu, we proceeded to propose another three different 
forms for the pressure of a general Markov random field, which basically can be summarized into 
two distinct formulas with each one having two counterparts using column and row setup 
respectively. As opposed to the conventional stochastic simulation for partition function 
estimation, we aimed at the deterministic calculation of partition function by means of the two 
distinct formulas to evaluate the validity of our theorems, which were referred to as Method 1 and 
Method 2 respectively. The numerical simulations reveal that, for Ising model, Method 1 exhibits 
a faster convergence than Method 2 under the same M'. However, if the comparison is based on 
the same computational cost, Method 2 apparently outperforms Method 1. While for the binary 
2nd order MRF, Method 2 behaves superiorly to Method 1 in both computational complexity and 
speed of convergence. The deterministic simulation results provide supporting evidence for our 
theorems. Besides, we have to emphasize that our theorem is valid for general MRFs. The 
selected examples can not cover the diversity and particularity of general MRFs. Hence it is too 
early to jump to the conclusion that Method 2 is always superior to Method 1. However, it is 
definite that Method 2 possesses computational superiority than Method 1 under the same M', 
especially when MRFs on large neighborhood systems are considered.
