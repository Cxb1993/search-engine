INTRODUCTION 
The piezoelectric motor is one type of actuator that differs from traditional 
actuators.  The thrust from the piezoelectric motor is the result of the vibration that 
occurs during the transformation of electrical energy to mechanical energy.  The thrust 
employs friction to propel the rotor by the converse piezoelectric effect of the 
piezoelectric ceramic. 
The disc type of the piezoelectric motor generally consists of one rotor and one 
stator.  Kurosawa and Ueha [1] analyzed the contact relationship between the rotor and 
the stator and calculated the motor’s dynamic behaviors by assuming the motor’s 
vertical vibration as the motion of linear spring.  The following year, Yamabuchi and 
Kagawa [2] designed the same circuit as Kurosawa and Ueha [1].  They used the Finite 
Element Method to analyze the elastic structure of electric-materials.  Takano et al. [3] 
developed a rotary electric motor with no-symmetrical vibration modes, but the motor 
efficiency was low.  Kurosawa and Ueha [4] designed a new type of motor in which the 
rotor was composed of a twisting vibrator.  This type of motor is highly efficient, and 
can exercise in two directions.  Kentrao et al. [5] analyzed a hybrid ultrasonic motor. 
According to their study, the maximum torque is relative to the voltage input, and the 
optimum design must consider the normal contact force between the stator and the rotor.  
Assuming the existence of two vibration modes and a standing wave, Takano et al. [6] 
analyzed the rotary ultrasonic motor. 
Nesbitt et al. [7] substituted the mechanical modes and electric modes into the 
systematic equations of motion.  They used the Rayleigh-Ritz assumed mode method to 
get a similar solution of the dynamic characteristics.  Jiromaru et al. [8] used a 
longitudinal-torsional vibration to analyze the load characteristics of a rotary ultrasonic 
motor.  Nicola et al. [9] used piezoelectric film made of alloy nickel to make an 
ultrasonic motor and simulated the rotor model using the theory of thin plate vibration.

DYNAMIC ANALYSIS  
The principal part of the disc type piezoelectric motor consists of one stator and 
one rotor.  As shown in Fig. 1 [7], the stator is composed of two thin piezoelectric 
ceramic discs and one disc of elastic metal substrate between the two piezoelectric 
ceramic discs.  Fig. 2 shows an interface model between the rotor and stator [7].  In this 
model, an applied load forces the rotor to keep contact with the stator.  The converse 
piezoelectric effect produces a traveling wave on the stator with an electric field 
existing on the piezoelectric ceramic disk.  The elliptic motion on this stator surface 
provides a friction force to drive the rotor when the traveling wave has been transfers to 
the stator. 
The modeling approach and system equation formulation of the piezoelectric 
motor are given in Nesbitt’s paper [7].  The displacement )w,v,u( of any point on the 
stator is a function of the plate’s centerline displacements )w,v,u( 000 , which can be 
represented with the assumed mechanical mode ][ mechΦ  as defined in the following:

stator contacts the rotor.  One is the interfacial normal force against the applied force; 
the other is the interface torque against the applied torque.  The traveling wave moves 
with a rotational speed Ω , and the rotor spins at speed rotorω .  In addition to rotorω , 
there is another systematic state, the flexure height fw , which defines the degree of 
separation between the rotor and the stator.  The pressure acting on the stator is defined

OPTIMIZATION APPROACH 
The objective of the optimization approach given in this paper include of 
maximizing the efficiency and spin speed of the rotor, and minimizing the frictional 
loss of the coating which is under the rotor.  Maximization and minimization can be 
separately or simultaneously.  In order to reduce frictional loss, minimizing the 
 10
identify the best designs in that region.  The flow chart of the hybrid method is shown in 
Fig. 3. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Three examples, including single-objective and mutli-objective optimization, are 
used to demonstrate the merits of the design algorithm.  The effects of system 
performances with different non-dimensional design variables in the design range are 
shown in Fig. 4.  Changing these design variables results in conspicuous variations of 
system performance. 
(i) Example 1: 
In this example, the objectives includes motor efficiency, rotor spin speed, and 
frictional loss of the coating individually.  As Table 1 shows, the spin speed of the rotor 
can be increased substantially.  But with the optimization, motor efficiency is reduced, 
and the maximum value of overlapw  in steady state is increased at the same time.  The 
reason for this is that, with the optimized design, the input power increases.  The 
friction force between the rotor and stator also increases both the power loss of the 
motor and the frictional loss of the coating, although the increase in the friction force 
increases the spin speed.  Table 2 shows that the motor efficiency is effectively 
increased.  For the same reason as given above, the rotor spin speed is reduced, and 
overlapw  is increased in the process of optimizing motor efficiency.  In the optimization 
of frictional loss, minimizing the maximum value of overlapw  in steady state is the 
objective.  The optimum design is shown in Table 3.  In Table 2 and Table 3, even the 
rotor spin speed becomes very close to the lowest bound of the behavior constraints.  
With the stability analysis, all the stability indices Λ  of the single-objective 
optimization are less than 1.  This shows that the piezoelectric motor is stable after the 
 12
The results of the optimization design are shown in Table 5, and the designated 
performances can be achieved on condition that not all the performances are designated 
to be increased at the same time.  The results show that the designated performances 
can be achieved within reasonable design ranges.  If the design method can not 
determine the optimum design variables of the designated performances, it means that 
the values of the designated performances are infeasible.  In other words, the designer 
can confirm the feasibility design of the designated performances by using the 
optimization design method.  In Table 5, two of the stability indices in the design are 
larger than 1, because the stability is not the behavior constraint of the optimization; in 
order to achieve the designated performances easily. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, an efficient optimization design algorithm, which combines genetic 
algorithms with the augmented Lagrange multiplier method, is proposed to optimize 
the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of a disc type piezoelectric motor under behavior 
constraints.  According to the proposed method, the designer can get the superior 
design of the piezoelectric motor without determining the initial design as traditional 
optimization methods.  The results show that the efficiency and spin speed of a motor 
can be improved, individually and simultaneously, and the frictional loss of the coating 
can be diminished.  With the designated performance of the rotor, the optimal design 
variables can also be found and fall within reasonable ranges for engineering 
requirements.
