southern hemisphere), and thus cannot be completely 
effective in real time. Alternatively, various 
organizations have developed detailed and accurate 
models of the atmosphere, based on GPS observations, 
for single-frequency users to reduce atmospheric 
effects as much as possible in post-processing [5]. 
However, some of these models are computationally 
complex. To compensate for the abovementioned 
drawbacks, we have developed an atmospheric 
correction with the dynamic intelligent adaptive filter 
in our frequency syntonization system. This scheme 
can allow traceability to the international time and 
frequency standard as disseminated by the GPS. 
The Intelligent Adaptive Forecasting Filter 
The dynamic intelligent adaptive forecasting filter 
can be used with a single-frequency receiver for 
frequency syntonization, when the disciplined 
oscillator is controlled dependently with atmospheric 
effects. The dynamic intelligent adaptive forecasting 
filter is illustrated in Figure 1. 
The configuration of the dynamic intelligent 
adaptive forecasting filter is mainly the Elman 
recurrent neural network (ERNN). The number of 
ERNNs is equal to the number of visible GPS satellites. 
For each ERNN, there are three inputs, seven hidden 
nodes, and one output node. The inputs of each ERNN 
include three types: average time tag, average elevation 
angle, and average azimuth angle between two 
measurement epochs for the associated GPS satellites. 
The unit transform [6] (86400sec,180D , and 360D ) is 
performed by the equation (1). The operations of unit 
transform and scaling aim to increase the training 
efficiency. The output of the ERNN is the average 
atmospheric differential delay without the disciplined 
oscillator effects.

Parameters Determination of the Intelligent 
Adaptive Forecasting Filter 
The frequency offsets (between two measurement 
epochs) of an eight-day experiment, in which GPS 
carrier phase observations of a stand-alone 
configuration with a primary clock, were used as the 
target data for each satellite (all-satellites-in-view). The 
target data are stored according to each satellite and 
time. Average target data mostly can be treated as the 
atmospheric differential delay. The inputs of every 
ERNN include three types: average time tag, average 
elevation angle, and average azimuth angle between 
two measurement epochs for the associated GPS 
satellites. The three types of input data are 
preprocessed by unit transform, according to 86400sec 
(TOW), 180 degrees (elevation angle), and 360 degrees 
(azimuth angle), respectively. The target is also 
preprocessed by a scaling factor of 1010  for efficient 
training. 
Finally, according to the pairs of input and target 
of each ERNN, the typical back-propagation methods 
were applied to set the weights and biases of each layer, 
respectively. According to the cost function, the results 
of training convergence for each satellite must agree 
with a +/-10% range of average training error. If not, 
the satellite should not be available for the user site. A 
training demonstration of the dynamic intelligent 
adaptive forecasting filter is shown in Figure 3. 
Configuration of the Carrier Phase-Disciplined 
Oscillator (GPSCDO) 
A low-cost, highly accurate real-time GPS carrier 
phase-disciplined oscillator system based on a 
single-frequency receiver is presented. In order to 
estimate the average frequency offsets of an oven 
controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) with respect to the 
GPS, the OCXO was connected to a time/frequency 
GPS receiver to replace its original oscillator. Hence, 
the behavior of the OCXO was determined from the 
GPS carrier phase observations. The average frequency 
offsets of the OCXO with respect to the GPS could be 
estimated by performing difference operations on 
carrier phase observations of all satellites in view 
between two measurement epochs. To reduce the 
interference coming from the atmospheric delay, a real- 
time dynamic intelligent adaptive forecasting filter was 
adopted. The parameters of the filter were obtained 
according to the results of an eight-day experiment, in 
which the GPS carrier phase observations of a 
stand-alone reference receiver with primary clock are 
recorded for each satellite. The primary clock should

to voltage is decreased to half command in normal 
mode. The control data rate is about 10 seconds under 
the forecasting mode. At the end of this forecasting 
control mode (according to the series pattern of 
received raw data), the buffer also needs to be cleared 
to ensure that the real-time operation switches to 
normal control mode.  
The hardware analog output range (HAOR) of the 
D/A converter is specified as from -10V to +10 V. The 
engineering unit range (EUR) controlling the scaling of 
D/A converter output data is designated as from -5E-8 
to 5E-8. The average frequency offsets, GPS time 
relative to the OCXO, are defined as the errors ( )E k of 
the PID controller. The discrete PID algorithm as 
derived is (Ziegler-Nichols Tuning Method):

39-km Distance Experimrnt 
In the same way, the frequency offsets (between 
two measurement epochs) of an eight-day experiment, 
in which we used the single-frequency GPS carrier 
phase observations of a stand-alone configuration (TL) 
with 10MHz signal produced by active hydrogen maser 
(5MHz, 22.7 o c , relative humidity 52.9%, shielded 
EMI), were used as the target data for each satellite (all 
satellites in view). Figure 5 shows the configuration of 
the 39-km distance experiment. 
The dynamic intelligent adaptive forecasting filter 
is trained and updated every day according to 
preceding-eight-day target data. The training target data 
are shifted by a one-day interval, and new one-day data 
is added from the TL reference station through Telnet 
to construct a new dynamic intelligent adaptive 
forecasting filter every day. The new filter, updated 
each day, is auto-renewed at midnight (LT) according 
to GPS time (LT = GPS time -14sec + 8 hours, after 31 
Dec., 2005). The updating time selected is due to the 
smaller atmosphere delay effects upon the controlling 
signal. After the dynamic intelligent adaptive 
forecasting filter is updated each day, the GPSCDO 
uses it to improve the atmospheric effects at 
NTU_IAM1 for about fifteen days (April 4-18, 2006). 
The GPSCDO operation is shown in Figure 6. The real 
distance between NTU_IAM1 station and TL station is 
about 39 kilometers (kms). The 39- kilometer distance 
relative to the distance from GPS satellites to either 
station is defined as the “local area”. Therefore, we 
term the experiment of the GPSCDO using the 
dynamic intelligent adaptive forecasting filter the 
‘39-km local-area experiment’.  
The phase differences using the TIC between the 
Cs. clock and the controlled OCXO are shown in 
Figure 7. The starting time of the data shown is at 0:00 
A.M. (Local Time). The 1-day accuracy is about the 
order of 10 14−  by use of linear fit. The frequency 
offsets caused by the Cs. clock being in a non-ideal 
environment is reduced. This is because the dynamic 
intelligent adaptive forecasting filter is created by the 
hydrogen maser clock under the TL ideal operational 
environment. Therefore, the parameters of the filter are 
adjusted with more precision. In addition, the
