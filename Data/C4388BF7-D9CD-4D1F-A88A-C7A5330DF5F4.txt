analysis of machine tool errors. In the same way 
that NC machine tools comprise a series of 
interconnected links and joints, optical systems 
comprise a series of elements and sensors, each 
having its own unique optical properties and 
resolution characteristics. Provided that the 
resolution of each optical component is known, 
sensitivity analysis provides the means to establish 
the respective contribution of each individual 
optical boundary surface along the ray path to the 
overall resolution of the optical system. The study 
in [10] relates to mechanical systems rather than 
optical systems. The discussions in the paragraph 
above have already moved away from tool systems 
to optical systems and so it is confusing to return to 
mechanical systems again. Accordingly, the current 
study conducts a sensitivity analysis based on a 
skew ray tracing approach to analyze the errors of a 
ray’s light path as it is reflected and/or refracted by 
a succession of optical elements with spherical 
boundary surfaces. The analysis considers the 
effects of six sources of light path error (i.e. three 
translational errors and three rotational errors) on 
the deviation of the light path at each boundary 
surface. Furthermore, the effects of these deviations 
on the incident position and unit directional vector 
of the refracted / reflected ray at the subsequent 
boundary surface are also examined. The validity of 
the proposed methodology is verified by examining 
the effects of optical errors of the rear reflective 
surface of a solid glass cat’s eye on the position and 
unit directional vector of the ray emerging from the 
front surface of the cat’s eye. 
The homogeneous coordinate representation of a 
vector in 3-space is a 4-space entity specified such 
that a particular perspective projection recreates the 
3-space. Transforming a vector in 3-space to a 
homogeneous coordinate representation requires the 
addition of an additional coordinate (i.e. a scale 
factor) to each vector such that the vector retains its 
original meaning when each of its components, 
including the scale factor, is multiplied by a 
constant [11]. In the analysis presented in this paper, 
the position vector  in 3-space is 
written in the form of a column 
matrix , where the 
pre-superscript " " of the leading symbol, , 
indicates that the vector is referred with respect to 
the coordinate frame 
j
. Given a point , its 
transformation i  is represented by the matrix 
product , where  is a  matrix 
defining the position and orientation (referred to 
hereafter as the configuration) of a frame  
with respect to another frame . The same 
notation rules are also applied to the unit directional 
vector

2. Skew ray tracing and error analysis at 
spherical boundary surfaces 
A fundamental feature of typical optical 
elements is that their boundary surfaces are surfaces 
of revolution. Consequently, the error analysis 
methodology proposed in this study commences by 
defining a generic boundary surface in terms of 
revolution geometry and then applies a ray tracing 
technique to establish the paths followed by skew 
rays as they undergo reflection and refraction at 
these surfaces. The spherical boundary surface 
i
i  
of an optical element can be obtained by rotating 
the generating line 
r
[ ]Tiiiiii 1SβR0CβRh = in the xizi 
plane about the zi axis, i.e. 
[ ]Tiiiiiiiiiiiiii 1SβRSαCβRCαCβRh)α,Rot(zr == ,    (1) 
where  is the rotation transformation 
matrix about the z
)α,Rot(z ii
i axis, iR  is the radius of the 
spherical boundary, and C and S denote cosine and 
sine functions, respectively. Equation (1) provides a 
generic expression for parametrizing the boundaries 
of optical elements with spherical surfaces in terms 
of  and the polar angular position . The unit 
normal vector  along the boundary surface  
is given by

where  is set to +1 or –1 such that the cosine of 
the incident angle has a positive value, i.e. . 
Having obtained general expressions for ii  and 
, any skew ray can be traced by applying the 
conventional reflective and refractive optical laws 
in terms of the unit directional vector of the incident 
ray and the unit normal of the spherical boundary 
surface. The unit normal vector along the boundary 
surface  can therefore be expressed as

3. Error analysis of cat’s eye retro-reflector 
This section demonstrates the validity of the 
proposed error analysis methodology using the case 
of a cat’s eye retro-reflector for illustration purposes. 
A typical application of such optical devices is that 
of a laser-tracking system [12], in which the 
position of the cat’s eye is automatically tracked 
and its distance from the laser source measured 
using an interferometer. In an earlier study, Lin and 
Lu [6] performed a sensitivity analysis to analyze 
the performance of the cat’s eye retro-reflector. The 
numerical results developed in their study showed 
that the deviation angles of exit rays having 
undergone multiple refraction or reflection events 
may become so large that retro-reflective behavior 
does not occur. Figure 3 presents a schematic 
illustration of the cross-section of a cat’s eye 
retro-reflector comprising two concentric 
hemispheres (of either similar or dissimilar 
materials) with different radii. The spherical surface 
of the larger hemisphere is covered with a 
total-reflection coating such that an incident ray 
arriving at point P3 on its surface via points P1 and 
P2 is reflected to point P4 and subsequently exits the 
front surface of the cat’s eye at point P5. The 
geometric configuration of the cat’s eye considered 
in the current analysis is of the conventional form, 
i.e. 13 RR ≠  and 211 Nξ1N == . Furthermore, an 
assumption is made that the adhesive used to join 
the two hemispheres has no effect on the optical 
orientation of the light ray emerging from the front 
optical surface following its reflection. In practical 
terms, the present results demonstrate the 
importance of performing an error analysis and then 
applying an appropriate calibration effect when 
designing and implementing precision measurement 
applications. 
4. Conclusion 
This paper has presented a skew ray 
tracing-based approach for the error analysis of 
optical systems comprising elements with spherical 
boundary surfaces. The proposed methodology 
considers two fundamental sources of error, namely 
the translational and rotational errors at each 
boundary surface and the differential changes in the 
incident point position and unit directional vector of 
the refracted / reflected ray as a result of differential 
changes in the position and unit directional vector 
of the light source. The validity of the proposed 
methodology has been demonstrated by analyzing 
the optical errors in a cat’s eye. In a future study, 
the methodology proposed in this paper will be 
extended to the error analysis of elements with 
aspherical boundary surfaces.
