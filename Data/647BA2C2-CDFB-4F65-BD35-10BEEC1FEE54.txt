較Ni-YSZ陽極具有較低的極化電阻與較高的交換電流密度。且於循環伏安測試中可發現改
良型陽極具有包圍較大的遲滯曲線面積。可能因為應用共摻雜電解質作為改良型陽極的擔
體，提升了陽極材料中氧離子擴散效率(O

reaction in the anode of a fuel cell. Compared with the traditional Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ, 
YSZ= (ZrO2)0.92(Y2O3)0.08) anode, lower polarization resistances and higher exchange current densities 
were observed in modified anodes from the Cole-Cole plots and the Tafel curves. The area of the 
hysteretic loop in the cyclic voltammetry curves were found to increase with an increase of 
anodic activity, which is attributed to easy migration and reduction of oxygen ions

導體改良陽極特性分析與半電池量測 
1. 電極微觀結構分析 
本次所設計之觸媒金屬Ni佔總體陽極
固含量 60wt%，共摻雜氧化鋯擔體佔總體
陽極固含量 40wt%，以其配置膠體，評估
燒結曲線與黏結劑(Binder)的體積，達到多
孔陽極設計。結果可知，共摻雜氧化鋯皆
成為所預期之立方晶相結構。於 80% Ar- 
20% H2還原氣氛中，進行 800 o
 
C持溫 2小
時的熱處理，可使陽極中NiO還原成Ni。
經由X光繞射儀的檢測，如圖 3所示，NiO
的繞射峰已消失並生成Ni。

時 80%Ar-20%H2
 
 reduction gas. 
透過掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察，60wt% 
NiO- 40wt% YSZ 陽極未還原之微觀形
貌，如圖 4(a)所示。富 NiO區微觀結構呈
現晶質狀(如箭頭所示)，而非晶質狀的部
分為乏 NiO區。經過還原氣氛熱處理，NiO
轉變成 Ni，由於離子鍵轉變為金屬鍵，使
其由晶質狀的微觀形成類似球狀的微觀
(如圖 4(b)箭頭所示)。圖 4(c)顯示，因 NiO
還原成 Ni，導致鍵結型態轉變形成類似球
狀 Ni晶粒，其與乏 Ni之 YSZ晶粒之間的
化學鍵結力較弱，故有部分 Ni之球形晶粒
已脫落形成孔洞。Ni-YSZ 陽極中 Ni，經
過 redox cycling 後會結團，使得 TPB 下
降，催化性降低，整體結構在反覆氧化與
還原氣氛下會產生破裂網狀的結構。這就
是為何 SOFC用久了後特性會下降的原因
[9]。利用 SEM-EDS 分析可判斷 NiO 或
Ni 是否可能與 YSZ 進行擴散或形成新的
反應物。由 XRD 分析可知，未進行還原
處理的 NiO-YSZ 陽極與進行還原處理後
的 Ni-YSZ 陽極其並無新相、化合物或新
反應物之峰值。圖 5分別對 Ni晶粒、Ni 晶
粒/乏 Ni 的 YSZ 晶粒邊緣與 YSZ 晶粒之
SEM-EDS 成份定性分析；可見隨著越接

面阻抗變化的情況。圖 7分別改良型陽極
於 不 同 頻 率 (0.1MHz-0.1Hz ； 
0.1MHz-1258.9Hz；1258.9Hz-0.1Hz)之極
化阻抗與溫度(700-800oC)之阿瑞尼氏圖，
從區分出來的頻率，可以分析整體(包含電
荷轉移與濃度)、高頻 (電荷轉移)與低頻(濃
度)反應在不同溫度下的情形。可發現Ni- 
(ZrO2)0.92(Y2O3)0.075(MgO)0.005 
分析共摻雜型氧化鋯電解質之離子導
電率可知，MgYSZ之特性最優異，離子導
電率較 8YSZ優異約 46%，而SrYSZ較
8YSZ優異 6.6%，故我們預估此次陽極之
特性結果應為Ni-MgYSZ > Ni-SrYSZ > 
Ni-YSZ。藉由計算其陽極的極化阻抗活化
能，可發現Ni-MgYSZ具有最小的活化
能，且截距也是最低的，表示Ni-MgYSZ
的確可較其他陽極可降低界面之陽極極
化。由於MgYSZ本身擁有最大的氧空缺半
徑、較低的晶格束縛能與氧空缺半徑最
大，可提供最佳之離子傳導能力，因此氧
離子容易傳導到三相點與氫離子反應。故
高溫下(700-800
(Ni-MgYSZ)極化電阻最低，導電性最高，
其次為Ni-SrYSZ，最差是Ni-YSZ。極化電
阻的趨勢與陽極材料之離子導電率有關，
其中以Ni-MgYSZ者最優異。 
oC)，各陽極於不同頻率下
之反應活化能，如表 1 所示。其於高溫
800o
對交流阻抗圖譜進行交互比對，分析
電雙層所造成之電容值 (Double layer

C的特性表現與所預測之特性一樣，
最佳為Ni-MgYSZ，其次分別是Ni-SrYSZ 
>Ni-YSZ，變化的趨勢與共摻雜電解質系
統之離子導電率相同。極化阻抗的結果印
證了本子計劃共摻雜型陽極之設計，利用
高離子導電率之共摻雜氧化鋯材料製作陽
極擔體，其本身較高的氧離子傳導活性，
使氧離子易擴散至三相點與燃料反應而提
升整體陽極催化活性，降低陽極反應之極
化電阻。 
dl)與電極特性之關係，如圖
8 所示。其為 Ni-YSZ、 Ni-MgYSZ與
Ni-SrYSZ於 700-800oC之交流阻抗比對圖
譜；如圖 8(a)所示。在 700oC量測環境下，
Cdl值的變化為Ni-MgYSZ < Ni-YSZ < 
Ni-SrYSZ；而在 800oC時為Ni-MgYSZ < 
Ni-SrYSZ < Ni-YSZ。電雙層電容之表現似
乎與極化電阻有相依性，Ni-MgYSZ具有
最低的電雙層電容Cdl
 
與極化電阻Rp值，顯
示Ni-MgYSZ之高離子導電率有助於電化
學反應產生，氧離子容易傳導到三相點與
氫離子反應，產生的電子也因電極材料“前
製用共摻雜電解質系統製作程”控制良
好，Ni顆粒分散均勻，故具有較佳的電子
傳導能力。 
3. 塔弗曲線、極化曲線與循環伏安法分析
共摻雜型陽極活性 
    由上一節分析各陽極極化電阻與電雙
層效應，可知利之改良陽極有較低的極化
電阻加上具高離子導電率，使得氧離子容
易擴散(晶體變形量且晶格束縛能最小)。
故共摻雜型陽極確實可改善 SOFC陽極極
化的問題，更減少 Ni-YSZ 極化損失，其
中以 Ni-MgYSZ特性最為優異，預期其能
提升三相點催化氫氣之活性。

如圖 12 的示意圖所示，正掃氧化反應的
曲線斜率越大，如同前所述極化曲線的斜
率越大表示有較小的極化損失，高觸媒活
性能釋放出較多的電子，且電子容易在電
極間傳導；在反掃的部分是接收電子然後
生成水的反應，故反掃曲線的斜率會隨反
應速率增加而降低，表示有更多生成水的
反應發生。所以陽極端構成整個循環伏安
曲線如同遲滯曲線(hysteresis loop)，其面
積越大，表示整體的催化反應活性越高。

活性隨溫度而提升的結果相同。改良陽極
之 循 環 伏 安 曲 線 皆 呈 現 遲 滯 曲 線
(hysteresis loop)，其表示經設計之改良陽
極因為本身具優秀的離子導電率和觸媒活
性，降低(1)反應與(2)反應的極化損失，其
因為Ni顆粒分佈均勻且三相點眾多，使得
氫氣催化反應(1)容易，易形成氫離子(H+)
與易於電子(e-
 
)傳導。

圖 12 正、反掃時 傳統 Ni-YSZ、改良型 Ni-MgYSZ

此外，改良電極利用高離子導電擔體，使
氧離子(O2-
. 
)易擴散至三相點與補充氧離子
於三相點之濃度，降低濃度極化，並使(2)
易反應。可見改良陽極不但具有較大的
hysteresis loop，且其曲線之斜率皆較常用
Ni-YSZ陽極大，表示新開發之共摻雜型陽
極不但具有極佳的催化活性、離子導電
率，可降低極化阻抗與電雙層的發生。

4. 陽極交流阻抗分析圖譜 
有鑒於直接用奈米纖維結構製作陽
極，因為奈米纖維外型具有高長寬比，即
使經燒結作業與電解質成連續相，其支撐
能力仍嫌不足，因此擬混合部分奈米粉末
加強纖維支撐能力；而本研究以 8YSZ電
解質(厚度 4.5mm)作為電解質支撐試片，
75 wt% 8YSZ纖維 + 25 wt% 8YSZ粉末混
合擔體濕式含浸 3M之Ni(NO3)2·6H2O水

雜系統製作之共摻雜型陽極其因本身極為

172.83 mW/cm2的發電效率，約為以
Ni-YSZ和YSZ作為陽極與電解質 (82.34

產生 NiO，必須要控制好與 YSZ奈米纖維
間的比例。因為 YSZ 奈米纖維為長型擔
體，除了要顧及 NiO在 8YSZ上的分佈，
要有多的三相點以外；Ni電子導體的連續
性亦很重要，在一般粉末製程上要達到
26wt%以上才可得 Ni連續相，在 60wt%有
最佳的催化性。 
下，所以未來若
使用陽極支撐，同時使用高濃度氫氣燃
料，在發電效應上將會有跳躍式的提升。

Abstract 
Variations of microstructures in Bi2O3-doped yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with 
conventional furnace and microwave sintering were investigated in this work. The results 
demonstrated that a small amount of addition of Bi2O3 was effective in reducing the sintering 
temperature of YSZ from 1500oC to 1200oC and promoting the densification rate of the ceramics. 
It is interesting that microwave sintering is found to suppress the evaporation rate of Bi2O3 and 
formation of the monoclinic-ZrO2 or other amorphous phases. Compared to conventional furnace 
sintering, significant improvement in density of Bi2O3-doped YSZ at lower sintering 
temperatures with microwave sintering was observed. Rapid heating rate and short sintering time 
for restricting serious segregation at grain boundary were observed as well. Employing 
microwave sintering at the same sintered condition, the density of a specimen was evidently 
increased by 4.59% in comparison to the specimen 
 
sintered with a conventional furnace sintering.

of Goldstein et al. indicates that the fully sintered, un-cracked YSZ specimens, can be 
produced at temperatures as low as 1200oC at heating rates ~5oC/min and the sintering 
temperature of YSZ could be reduced by 14% using microwave sintering compared with 
conventional sintering. [18]  
Accordingly, it is found that the ionic conductivity of Bi2O3-doped zirconia ceramics 
with different amounts of Bi2O3 and ZrO2 exhibit sometimes better and sometimes worst 
properties from the previous reports, due to formation of the low conductivity monoclinic 
phase. Hence, in the present work, we would like to investigate the mechanism of 
microwave assisted densification in Bi2O3-doped YSZ specimens and the results were 
compared with a conventional sintering. The presence of large concentration of lattice 
imperfection in the Bi2O3 and YSZ structures would be affected by the high frequency 
field. Faster elimination of closed porosity in the specimen due to selective enhancement 
of material flux by placing Bi2O3 of low melting temperature at the concave surface and 
formation of a space-charge layer in near-surface amorphous regions of YSZ ceramic 
particles leading to enhanced grain boundary diffusion process. The field-enhanced 
mobility during diffusion in observed rapid kinetics was considered for decreasing 
serious diffusion and evaporation of Bi2O3 to restrict the formation of m-ZrO2
Raw powder of YSZ (99.9% purity, 
 or other 
amorphous phases in the specimen. An endeavour to develop an electrolyte material with 
high ionic conductivity and low sintering temperature using microwave sintering was 
therefore attempted in the present work.  
 
2. Experiment 
HSY-8, Daiichi Kagaku Kogyo, Japan) containing 
monoclinic and cubic phases, was pre-calcined at 1300oC to obtain a complete cubic 
phase. Raw powder of pure Bi2O3 (99% purity, Nippon Yttrium Company Limited, 
Japan) has shown α-phase. Mixtures of the Bi2O3-doped YSZ powders were prepared by 
adding appropriate amount of Bi2O3 to YSZ powders and ball milling for two days using 
oxide mixing method. The resulting powders were pressed into circular green discs with a 
diameter of φ15 mm by mold press with a load of 1200 kgf and were sintered between 
1000oC and 1300oC for 2 hrs by conventional furnace at heating rates ~5oC/min. Phase 
identification of specimens was analyzed using X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku DMAX-B, 
 6 
temperature sintering of YSZ (1000°C-1200°C) was in-effective to stabilize of the c-YSZ, 
even though Bi2O3 was added as sintering aid. Besides, binary phase diagram of ZrO2 
and Y2O3 at low Y2O3 contents reveal un-stable m-ZrO2. At low sintering temperature 
less than 1200oC, the δ-YSB of lower melting temperature and the m-ZrO2 with low Y/Zr 
ratio were easily formed by diffusion of Y2O3 from YSZ to α-Bi2O3. Since it is not 
possible to get complete cubic phase in Bi2O3-doped YSZ at lower sintering 
temperatures, sintering at 1300°C for 2 hrs was carried out, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The 
diffraction patterns also exhibit the reflections of the m-ZrO2. Y2O3 in YSB transports to 
YSZ to increase the Y/Zr ratio of the m-ZrO2 phase, and therefore the amount of c-ZrO2 
was observed to increase. The overall data on phase structure of Bi2O3-doped YSZ 
specimens indicates that formation of the stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and precipitation of 
m-ZrO2 depends on sintering temperature. 
In Bi2O3-YSZ system, the melting points are markedly different for Bi2O3 and YSZ. 
Therefore, simultaneous sintering of three components gives inhomogeneous distribution 
of composition and, as a result, m-ZrO2 is observed as second phase in most of the c-
ZrO2. The amount of δ-Bi2O3 and m-ZrO2 are significantly decreases with an increase of 
the sintering temperature, indicating that the serious evaporation of δ-Bi2O3 occurs at 
high sintering temperatures.  
The tendency of sudden decrease of Bi2O3 content was found with increase of 
sintering temperatures from 1000oC to 1300oC in Bi2O3-doped YSZ system. This is due 
to severe evaporation of pure Bi2O3 powder during heating upto 1300°C at a heating rate 
of 10°C/min. [21] As Bi2O3 content increase, Bi2O3 may appear as a liquid phase at 
grain boundaries of ZrO2-Bi2O3 system, because solubility of Bi3+
Microwave sintering was carried out to evaluate the evaporation rate of Bi
 in zirconia is less than 
5 mol%. [20]  
2O3. 
Compared to conventional furnace sintering, significant improvement in the density of 
zirconia ceramics was obtained at lower sintering temperatures. [22] Microwave sintering 
was found to have the advantages: rapid heating rate and short sintering time. We 
demonstrated that the advantages of microwave sintering process could solve the problem 
of δ-Bi2O3 evaporation. The relationship between experimental density and sintering 
temperatures from 900oC to 1200oC for microwave sintering of YSZ alloyed with 10

Density of Bi2O3-doped YSZ specimens after sintered at a temperature from 900°C to 
1300°C using two different sintering processes (conventional furnace sintering and 
microwave sintering) are shown in Fig. 3(b). Microwave sintered samples shown better 
results than conventional sintered specimens at the same sintering conditions. All the 
specimens sintered by microwaves, significantly show higher experimental density when 
compared with conventional sintered specimens processed at a temperature from 900°C 
to 1100°C for 30 min. This might be due to reduction in evaporation rate of Bi2O3 by 
using microwave sintering process.  
Figure 4(a) to Fig. 4(d) shows the secondary electron images of 1 mol% to 10 mol% 
Bi2O3 doped YSZ specimens after sintered at 1300°C for 2 hrs using conventional 
furnace. The grain size of the specimens in Bi2O3-doped YSZ system is found to increase 
with an increase of Bi2O3 content. This morphology may be attributed to formation of 
large amount of oxygen vacancy by dissolving Bi2O3 into YSZ, because oxygen 
vacancies provides diffusion path for elements. The microstructures of conventional and 
microwave sintered 10 mol% Bi2O3-doped YSZ specimens sintered at 1100oC for 30 min 
are shown in Fig. 4(e) and Fig. 4(f). Smaller grain size and dense structure were observed 
in microwave sintered specimens, indicating that the diffusion behavior of elements has 
been affected by applying different sintering processes. Microwave sintered specimen 
shows large number of small grains, containing large amount of δ-Bi2O3 and c-ZrO2 
phases as well as small amount of m-ZrO2. The amount of m-ZrO2 in the microwave 
sintered specimen is much lower than the conventional furnace sintered specimen at the 
same sintering condition. It is interesting that microwave sintering could suppress the 
evaporation of Bi2O3 and dissolution of Y2O3 from YSZ to Bi2O3 to form m-ZrO2
SEM image and EDS results for small and large grains of conventional furnace 
sintered 10 mol% Bi
. The 
element segregation in the specimens would be determined by using SEM-EDS analysis. 
2O3-doped YSZ specimens after sintered at 1300oC for 2 hrs are 
shown in Fig. 5(a). Smaller grain shows higher amount of Bi-element than larger grain, 
but exhibits smaller amount of Y2O3. However, the grains exhibit primary composition 
of Zr. Figure 5(b) displays the results on microstructural features and element 
distribution of conventional furnace sintered 10 mol% Bi2O3-doped YSZ specimens after 
sintered at 1100oC for 3 hrs. The amount of Bi- element is significantly higher than that 
 10 
grains (small and large). Bismuth is rich in smaller grains. Transmission electron 
micrographs revealed similar behavior. Though the monoclinic phase is not observed in 
XRD analysis, the nano-scale analysis using TEM has shown the existence of monoclinic 
phase even at higher sintering temperatures. This research also provides a good 
understanding of the correlation of ionic conductivity and microstructures at YSZ in 
presence of Bi2O3. Microwave sintering was carried out in order to reduce the 
evaporation rate of Bi2O3 during sintering process. Comparing to conventional furnace 
sintering, significant improvement and advantage in term of higher density of zirconia 
ceramics at lower sintering temperature, rapid heating rate and short sintering time were 
observed. Microwave sintering was demonstrated to overcome the problems with the 
evaporation of Bi2O3

Abstract 
Sandwich sensing structure La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM)/ Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) /LSM 
has been developed for application in micro-pressure sensor and an improvement of 
ferroelectric properties is studied. Experimental results showed that highly dense 
structure and low resistance (about 10 mΩ-cm) of LSM thin film could be fabricated by 
sputtering with optimal parameters. In the micro-fabrication process of ferroelectric 
sensing structure, a novel Pt/LSMO functional top electrode was constructed by lift-off 
method to protect the LSM/ PZT/ LSM micro-sensing structure during PZT wet etching 
process. The LSM/ PZT/ LSM sensing structure exhibits improved ferroelectric 
properties, including an increase of the remanent polarization value from 20.35 μC/cm2 to 
23.97 μC/cm2 and a decrease of coercive field from 93.11 kV/cm2 to 90.82 kV/cm2 after 
substituting the Au top-electrode with Pt/LSMO electrode. The micro-sensing structure 
reveals good fatigue resistance under 4 Ec and 5 Ec applied voltage at 10 kHz condition 
after switching cycles of 1010

Ti(700 Å)/ SiO2(1500 Å)/ Si(500 μm) substrate to form a PZT wet film. PZT wet film 
was dried at 150oC for 5 mins for hydrolysis, pyrolysized at 400oC for 20 mins and 
annealed at 650oC for 0.5 hr. LSMO top-electrode of the pressure sensor was fabricated 
on PZT thin film via RF-magnetron sputtering (Kaoduen, Taiwan), and gold (Au) as well 
as Pt/LSMO are used as the top-electrodes of the sensing structure. Two different kinds 
of sensing structures of the dynamic micro pressure sensor including 
Pt/LSMO/PZT/LSMO/Pt/Ti/TiO2/SiO2/Si and Au/PZT/LSMO/Pt/Ti/TiO2/SiO2/Si were 
fabricated. Phase identification of thin film was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer 
(M18XHF, MAC Science, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation. The microstructural features of 
the specimens were inspected under a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6330F, JEOL, 
Japan). Remanent polariztion- coercive field (P-E) and leakage current curves (C-V) of 
the specimens were evaluated by a Precision WorkStation 2000 (Radiant, USA). The 
fatigue resistances of the specimens were tested with a 10 kHz, 4Ec and 5Ec applied 
voltage, and 1010 switching cycles of polarization reversals. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Mixtures of La2O3, SrCO3 and MnO2 were sintered from a solid solution LSMO 
target. Figure 1 illustrated the X-ray diffraction patterns of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 powder after 
calcined at 1000oC and that of LSMO target for sputtering process after sintered at 
1350oC. LSMO thin film was coated on the surface of Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate by using 
RF magnetic sputtering, and X-ray diffraction patterns of LSMO films after annealing at 
temperatures between 600oC and 900oC were shown in Fig. 2. The (110) peak of TiO2 
was found in X-ray diffraction pattern of LSMO on a Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate after 
annealing at temperatures higher than 800oC. It is attributed to that Ti element diffused 
from Ti metallic layer of Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate to LSMO thin film and combined with 
O2 to form TiO2. PZT thin film was coated on LSMO surface of LSMO/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si 
substrate and annealed at 800oC for 30 mins. The results demonstrated that the preferred 
orientation of perovskite structure with (110) direction was formed in PZT film. Phase 
stability and crystallinity of perovskite PZT thin film was enhanced as a function of the 
annealing temperature, based upon increment of the PZT peak intensities in the X-ray 
diffraction patterns. However, the TiO2 layer on LSMO film would affect the variation of 
leakage current in the PZT structure.  
X-ray diffraction patterns of spin-coated PZT thin films on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si and 
LSMO/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates after annealing at temperatures between 600oC and 
900oC for 30 mins are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Occurrence of the intermediate 
pyrochlore phase was observed in PZT film coated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si at annealing 
temperatures below 650oC. But, formation of preferred-oriented PZT film with (110) 
direction was found while annealing temperature higher than 650oC. 
Compared with the PZT films coated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate, significantly preferred 
orientated PZT films with (100) direction is found on the LSMO/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate. 
The intensities of (100) and (110) PZT peaks increase with the increase of annealing 
temperatures, but decrease at temperatures higher than 800o
In addition, PZT thin film coated on sputtered LSMO substrate exhibits significant 
preferred orientation structure with (100) direction, compared to PZT thin film coated on 
the Sol-Gel LSMO substrate [10]. It is ascribed to the fact that the activation energy of 
C due to the evaporation of 
lead of PZT.  
 26 
μC/cm2 to 23.97 μC/cm2 and a decreasing of coercive field from 93.11 kV/cm2 to 90.82 
kV/cm2, after substituting the Au top-electrode by Pt/LSMO. 
Compared the variations of dielectric constant with different electric field for 
Au/PZT/LSMO and Pt/LSMO/PZT/Pt specimens as shown in Fig. 10, a symmetrical C-V 
curve was observed in Pt/LSMO/PZT/Pt specimen, but rather in Au/PZT/LSMO 
specimen. It is attributed to the unsymmetrical sensing structure of Au/PZT/LSMO and 
the electric conductivities of Au top-electrode and LSMO bottom-electrode are different.  
Figure 11(a) and Fig. 11(b) are the variations of leakage current density with different 
operating voltages between 3V and 12V in Au/PZT/LSMO and Pt/LSMO/PZT/LSMO 
specimens. A monotonic increase in the leakage current density of Au/PZT/LSMO as a 
function of electric field was observed, but significant increasing of leakage current 
density of device using lift-off Pt/LSMO top-electrode with increase of annealing 
temperatures upto 750oC was found. This may be attributed to worse crystallinity in PZT. 
However, the leakage current of Pt/LSMO/PZT/LSMO specimen was found to increase 
with increase of annealing temperatures upto 750oC, but the resistance of PZT was 
remarkably enhanced at 800oC, probably due to thermal diffusion of Mn into PZT, which 
forms acceptor-doped PZT with an enhancement of resistivity of materials. 
The fatigue property of LSMO/PZT/LSMO micro sensor was measured in the electric 
fields at 4Ec and 5Ec for 100 kHz. Very limited fatigue phenomenon was observed after 
switching cycles upto 1010
Process modification for micro-sensor sandwich sensing structure with sputtered 
LSMO metallic oxide electrode thin film was investigated in this work. Preferred 
orientation of PZT thin film with (100) direction was successfully coated on LSMO 
electrode by using RF magnetic sputtering. The crystallinity of PZT thin film was 
enhanced with the increase of temperatures. The interfacial reactive layer between Pt and 
LSMO exhibits lower etching rate and possesses lower interfacial mismatch between 
LSMO and Pt layers, which reduces interface split caused by thermal stresses. The 
resistivity of LSMO electrode decreases with the increase of annealing temperatures, due 
to the enhancement of the crystallinity of LSMO. The LSM/ PZT/ LSM sensing structure 
shows improved ferroelectric properties, including an increase of the remanent 
polarization value from 20.35 μC/cm
 polarization reversals in LSMO/PZT/LSMO micro sensor 
based upon the analysis of residual Pr value of device as Fig. 12. On the contrary, the 
Au/PZT/LSMO structure fails after the same fatigue test conditions. The result implies 
that the modified top-electrode in the present work exhibits superior durability in 
reliability issue. 
 
4. Conclusions 
2 to 23.97 μC/cm2 and a decrease of coercive field 
from 93.11 kV/cm2 to 90.82 kV/cm2, after substituting the Au top-electrode with 
Pt/LSMO. However, the remanent polarization value and electric conductivity were 
reduced due to the occurrence of serious element diffusion at the interface between PZT 
and LSMO. High leakage current density of device using lift-off Pt/LSMO top-electrodes 
at lower annealing temperatures was found, probably due to poor crystallinity of material. 
The resistance of PZT could be enhanced at 800oC, because of the increment of the 
crystallinity of PZT film and acceptor-doped oxygen formation. Limited fatigue in the 
materials at electric fields of up to 5Ec for 100 kHz is observed in LSMO/PZT/LSMO

was observed on surface of the bottom Pt electrode after etching using 10% HNO3- 90% 
H2O solution.

1. Introduction 
Zirconia based ceramics are most commonly used as electrolytes in solid oxide fuel 
cells (SOFCs), due to their higher ionic conductivity and desirable chemical stability in 
both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. The mechanical properties and reduction-
resistance of zirconia-based ceramics are better than that of other electrolytes as CeO2 [1], 
Bi2O3 [2] and La2Mo2O9 
In order to reduce the sintering temperature of an SOFC, the Bi
[3] based materials. But formation of serious element 
segregation in electrode and occurrence of high temperature corrosion in the metallic 
components of a SOFC system were observed, because the sintering temperature and 
operation temperature of YSZ is too high. Therefore, to develop new materials with 
lower sintering and operation temperatures may reduce the cost of an SOFC.  
2O3-doped zirconia 
ceramics had been developed for decreasing the sintering temperature and increasing the 
densification of materials [4-8]. Keizer et al. [4] suggested that a part of the Bi2O3 in 
ZrO2-Y2O3-Bi2O3 ternary system is separated from the homogeneous phase, for instance, 
as a Y2O3-Bi2O3 solid solution which  is th e δ-structure. The δ-Bi2O3 displays 
outstanding ionic conductivity at a lower operation temperature [5] and could be sintered 
at low temperatures. The conductivity of δ-Bi2O3 phase was also fortunately found to be 
independent of the oxygen particle pressure, at least down to 10-3 Pa. Winnubst et al. 
reported the variations of the ionic conductivity in yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) doped 
with different amount of Bi2O3 [6, 7], the bulk conductivity at 800°C increases from 
0.0028 S/cm for un-doped YSZ to 0.0162 S/cm for 0.5 mol% Bi2O3 addition. The results 
of ionic conductivity in YSZ and Bi2O3-doped YSZ specimens as Winnubst et al. 
reported are too low, although enhancement of conductivity is almost one order to that of 
 40 
conductivity and lower sintering temperature, dopant effect of MgO and Y2O3-Bi2O3 
Fabrication of the composite powders of (ZrO
(YSB) on the variations of phase structure, ionic conductivity and sintering temperature 
of YSZ electrolyte were investigated and evaluated in this work.  
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
2)0.92(Y2O3)0.075(MgO)0.005 (YSZM) 
were prepared from pure ZrO2 (99.9% purity, Daiichi, Japan), MgO (99.9% purity, 
Nippon Yttrium Company Limited, Japan) and Y2O3 (99.9% purity, Nippon Yttrium 
Company Limited, Japan) powders and pre-calcined at 1350oC for 2 hrs. Raw powder of 
pure Bi2O3 (99% purity, Nippon Yttrium Company Limited, Japan) was modified by 
adding 25 mol% Y2O3 to be δ phase structure (δ-YSB) after pre-calcined at 800oC for 20 
hrs. Mixture of YSZM and YSB was fabricated by an oxide-mixing method, followed by 
calcination at 1100oC for 1hr and ball milling. Thin circular green pellets of diameter 15 
mm were made by cold iso-static pressing under a load of 2000 kgf, and then were 
sintered at 1100oC and 1300oC for 5 hrs in air. Phase identification of the sintered pellets 
was analyzed by using an X-ray diffractometer (M18XHF, MAC Science, Japan) with Cu 
Kα radiation. The microstructural features of specimens were inspected using a scanning 
electron microscope (JSM-6330F, JEOL, Japan). The ionic conductivity of specimen was 
measured by AC impedance analyzer (Model: Solartron 1260/1280W, UK) to extract the 
bulk resistance from the complex impedance as a function of frequency. The impedance 
data was taken in the frequency range of 0.1Hz-1MHz under a specified temperature 
between 300oC and 800oC in air. Following the pioneering work of Bauerle [12], the 
 42 
doped YSZ (2YBZ) and 3 mol% YSB-doped YSZ (3YBZ) as shown in Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 
2(c). Residual Bi2O3 is observed in 3YBZ at the temperatures below 1200oC, indicating 
that it is difficult for the solid solution of Bi2O3-Y2O3-ZrO2 to form at lower sintering 
temperatures, due to lower solid solution rate of Bi2O3 in YSZ. 
Fig. 2(d) to Fig. 2(f) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of YBZM specimens after 
sintered at 1100oC to 1300oC for 5 hrs. The specimens of YSB doped YSZM (YBZM) 
display smaller amount of m-ZrO2, than YBZ specimens at the same Bi2O3 addition and 
sintering conditions. It is well known that the melting temperature of YSB at around 
1000oC, δ-YBZ phase might be formed as a thin Bi2O3 -rich liquid film at grain boundary 
as a diffusion path for material sintering. The diffusion velocity of Mg2+, Y3+ and Bi3+ in 
zirconia matrix are different, and the solid solution limit of Bi2O3-ZrO2 is much lower 
than that of MgO-ZrO2 and Y2O3-ZrO2. The element distribution of Bi3+, Mg2+ and Y3+ 
is effective in changing the mircostructural morphologies of YBZ and YBZM. However, 
the experimental results demonstrated that MgO might be a better stabilizer than Y2O3 in 
Y2O3-Bi2O3-ZrO2 ternary system to form the c-ZrO2 structure. The amount of 
monoclinic-ZrO2 also decreases with an increase of YSB content, due to existence of 
larger amount of Y2O3
The relationship between specimen density and sintering temperatures within 
1200
 stabilizer.  
oC and 1300oC of YBZM sintered at the same soaking time of 5 hrs was listed in 
Table 2. The density of YBZM specimens depend on sintering temperature, because of 
the density of specimen have been affected by the evaporation of δ-YSB and the capillary 
action of liquid phase at grain boundary [13-17]. The density of specimen sintered at 
1200oC, which closes to the theoretical density of 94.83%, is higher than that of specimen 
 44 
might be due to that a thin Bi2O3-rich liquid film exists at the grain boundary as a 
diffusion path for the sintering, and Y, Bi as well as Mg are easily segregated into grain 
boundaries. Intergranular fracture was found in the fracture surface of YSB-doped YSZM 
system as shown in Fig. 5(a). Because the δ-YSB phase appeared as a thin Bi2O3 -rich 
liquid film at the grain boundary and the mechanical properties of thin Bi2O3 -rich liquid 
film at grain boundary is worse than zirconia matrix.  
We compare the impedance patterns at 800oC for two specimens 8YSZ sintered at 
1500oC and 3YBZM at 1200oC shown in Fig. 5(b). The semicircles of 3YBZM are much 
smaller than that of 8YSZ, indicating that the ionic conductivity of intragrain, grain 
boundary and total bulk of 3YBZM are all higher than that of 8YSZ. The relationship 
between the conductivities of intragrain and grain boundary in 3YBZM with different 
temperatures resulted in abrupt increment of the grain boundary conductivity, due to the 
segregation of YSB with high conductivity at grain boundaries. The resistance of grain 
boundary significantly decreased with increase of operation temperatures and 
disappeared while testing temperatures higher than 700oC as shown in Fig. 6(a), 
compared to the resistance of intragrain in 3YBZM specimen. Arrhenius plots for the 
total bulk conductivities of 8YSZ sintered at 1500oC and YSZM sintered at 1500oC, 
compared to that of YBZM system sintered at temperatures between 1200oC and 1300o
The ionic conductivities of 1200
C 
were shown in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c). It is interesting that 3YBZM exhibits the best 
results. The ionic conductivities of total bulk in YBZM system was demonstrated to be 
enhanced by adding YSB from 1 mol% to 3 mol%.  
oC sintered specimens of YBZM system are all 
higher than YBZM specimens sintered at 1300oC, due to high density of specimens. 
 46 
velocity of defects and impurities. The grain size of YSB-doped YSZ specimens is also 
observed to increase with increase of sintering temperatures. Growth rate of grain size in 
YSB-doped YSZM system is significantly faster than YSB-doped YSZ system, because 
of MgO and Y2O3 co-doped zirconia system possesses large radius of oxygen vacancy to 
migrate oxygen ion, defects and impurities easily, compared with YSZ specimen. Thin 
Bi2O3-rich liquid film at grain boundary as a diffusion path for the sintering, therefore Y, 
Bi and Mg elements are easily segregated into grain boundary. The intergranular fracture 
was found in the fracture surface of YSB-doped YSZM system.  
The tendency of ionic conductivity values in YBZM specimens, which are 3YBZM 
> 2YBZM >1YBZM, is related to the increasing amount of YSB content, which were 
46% higher than that of 8YSZ. Accordingly, adding appropriate amounts of MgO and 
YSB could reduce the sintering temperature of YSZ system from 1500oC to 1200oC and 
suppress the formation of m-ZrO2 to produce highly dense specimen for enhancing the 
ionic conductivity of YSZ matrix from 0.01 S/cm to 0.02 S/cm at 800o
