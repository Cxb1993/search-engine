MR(strong) are not von Neumann reflections, 
according to the current view on them [2,3], yet large 
and remarkably large discrepancies between these 
experiments and predictions obtained from 
global/local 3-shock theories systematically and 
persistently exist, as sM  and (or) wθ  decrease. 
Keywords: three-shock theory, von Neumann 
reflections, pseudo-steady Mach reflections. 
2. Introduction 
Figure 1 shows typical wave configurations of 
strong and weak pseudo-steady Mach reflections 
(PMR). For PMR, a Mach stem/wall boundary 
condition is required to close the system of 12 
nonlinear conservation equations and 2 slipstream 
conditions to give a unique, global triple point 
trajectory angle χ , the value of which determines all 
other geometric and thermodynamic variables of this 
problem of ( γ , wθ , sM ), where γ , gas specific 
heats ratio, sM , the incident propagating shock 
Mach no., wθ , the reflecting wedge angle. Actually, 
χ  can be theoretically anticipated from dimensional 
analysis, for there are no length or time scales 
inherent to it. For steady MR, except for special cases, 
this boundary condition cannot be satisfied in 
3-shock theory, giving the theory a strong local 
character without the occurrence of a global χ . 
Typical wave configurations of weak and strong 
PMRs, as shown in Figs 1 & 4, prove that they 
satisfy a nearly normal, straight Mach stem/wall 
boundary condition are shown in Figs 1 & 4. 
Therefore, it is wrong to state that the χ  must be 
obtained from experimental observation for analysis, 
and that it is impossible to calculate χ  from the 
3-shock theory for weak MR [2,4]. On the other hand, 
the global 3-shock χ  solutions have never been 
calculated for systematic comparisons with 
experiments for weak PMR in the literature, except 
for the author's 1996 work [5]. A direct consequence 
of the application of the global 3-shock theory is the 
classification of the 3-shock theoretical solution 
regimes in terms of the two parameters, sM  and 
wθ , not just sM .There are three major regimes of 
global 3-shock theoretical solutions, vNR, forward- 
facing reflected oblique shock solutions; 
MR(weak/strong), backward-facing reflected weak/ 
strong oblique shock solutions [5]. Barbosa & Skews 
[6] misinterpreted the wall boundary layer effect on 
their local 3-shock theory calculated wave angles, 
based on these solutions being of the type of 
MR(weak). However, they nearly all belong to 
MR(strong). Moreover, there are no reasons to 
extend the concept of the correction of negative 
viscous displacement effect on 2θ  of regular 
reflection, governed by the wall condition, directly to 
the correction on 2θ  of MR, governed by the 
slipstream pressure and deflection compatibility 
condition [6]. Kobayashi et al. [7] reported that, for 
sM = 1.30, wθ = °75.10 , the angle between the 
incident and reflected shocks varies from °03.46  to 
°57.38 , as the incident shock proceeds with an 
observed self-similar χ  = °82.16 . They later 
attributed this unsteadiness phenomenon to viscous 
boundary layer effect over wedge surface. However, 
with the incident shock angle giving 1M  = 1.0023, 
the entire range of backward (forward) facing 
reflected shock angle is °12.86  ( °90 ) to °90  
( °88.93 ). Thus, this unsteadiness event is simply not 
possible, unless the reflected wave is not a shock 
wave. Sandeman [8] presented a simple physical 
theory for weak PMR. However, it is meaningless to 
propose a new PMR theory with the reflected wave 
still being a shock, claiming successfully predicting 
χ  yet admitting a failure of the 3-shock solution at 
the obtained triple point itself. 
 
3. Analysis 
When the global theory cannot adequately 
describe a PMR, the local theory is then applied with 
measured χ substituting into it. Five angular 
parameters, χ , 2φ  (reflected shock angle), 3φ  
(Mach stem angle), 2θ  (deflection behind reflected 
shock), 3θ  (deflection behind Mach shock), (not the 
combination of them giving the angles between 
different waves), are available, in addition to 
thermodynamic ones, for systematic comparisons 
(not only one or several) between experiments and 
3-shock theories to lead to support or reject a PMR 
theory. Robustness or sensitivity are not reasons not 
to choose any one of these five angular parameters 
for systematic comparisons [2], for the nonlinearity is 
one of key features of PMR problems. The essence of 
applying the local theory is the proof of applicability 
or inapplicability of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump 
relations in describing the reflected wave of the local 
3-shock confluence, where there are exact solutions 
provided by the governing single tenth degree 
polynomial equation of the theory. Figure 2 presents 
series systematic comparisons between the 
comprehensive Smith's experiments and global/local 
3-shock theories. There are 147 PMR experiments in 
Smith's [1] work. 55, 51, and 46 of them belong to 
the regimes of vNR, MR(strong), and MR(weak), 
respectively. For the experiments lying in vNR, the 
local 3-shock predicted reflected waves are all 
expansion shocks, and 70% of measured 2θ s are 
significantly larger or larger than max,2θ s of 
computed reflected shocks. For the experiments lying 
in MR(strong), 18% of the predicted reflected waves 
are expansion shocks, and 50% of measured 2θ s are 
larger than max,2θ s of computed reflected.
