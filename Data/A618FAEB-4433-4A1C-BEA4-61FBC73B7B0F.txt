decrease unnecessary power consumption in 
saturating logic circuits and digital inverter 
applications. However, similar to the 
heterostructure-emitter bipolar transistors, due 
to the charge storage in the neutral-emitter 
region the current gain of the SE-RTBT is 
somewhat lower than that of the conventional 
heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). 
Furthermore, the RT mechanism is dominated 
by low-field domain and the numbers of NDR 
curves are simply determined by the number 
of minibands in the superalttice. 
In this work, InP/GaInAs SE-RTBT that 
performs with a high current gain, a low offset 
voltage, and multiple NDR behaviors 
resulting from high-field domain are 
demonstrated by theoretical analysis and 
experimental results.

(1) Miniband structure and tunneling 
mechanism 
In order to investigate the tunneling 
mechanism of the studied device, an 
approximate tunneling model is employed to 
describe the properties of quantum transport. 
A potential-energy profile in the InP/InGaAs 
superlattice under ideal flat-band condition is 
shown in Fig. 1. For the theoretical analysis, 
the influence of the InP barrier thickness and 
InGaAs well width on the miniband structures 
are investigated, while the other parameters 
such as n+-InGaAs cap layer and n-InGaAs 
emitter layer are fixed. By solving the 
time-independent one-dimensional 
Schrödinger equation, the envelope function
φ of electrons in the superlattice is given as:

Figure 2 shows the transmission 
coefficient T*T as a function of electron 
energy E for various InGaAs well widths of 
the five-period InP/InGaAs superlattice. Here, 
the thickness of InP barrier is fixed at 50 Å. 
As seen from the figure, only one miniband, 
i.e., the ground band E0, is observed for the 
superlattice with 30 and 50 Å-InGaAs wells. 
The second miniband, i.e., the first excited 
band E1, appears as the InGaAs well widths 
are increased to 80 and 100 Å. It is known 
that the energy range (width) of the ground 
band E0 is reduced with the increase of well 
thickness. In other words, the E0 in 
InP/InGaAs (50 Å /30 Å  and 50 Å /50 Å )

InP layers were selectively etched by the

AuGeNi and AuZn metals for n-type emitter, 
collector and p-type base, respectively. The 
schematic cross section of the studied 
InP/InGaAs SE-RTBT is depicted in Fig. 4. 
The emitter area is 5 × 10-5 cm2.

(3) Experimental result and discussion 
Figure 5 illustrates the experimental 
forward current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of 
B-E junction at room temperature. A low 
turn-on voltage of 0.34 V at 0.1 mA level is 
obtained. The low turn-on voltage can be 
attributed to the reduction of potential spike at 
B-E junction for the use of small band-gap 
p+-InGaAs base and thin n-InGaAs layer. 
Significantly, the interesting multiple-state 
NDR regions are observed at VBE = 0.73, 0.95, 
and 1.18 V, respectively. Due to the thermal 
effect at room temperature, the peak-to-valley 
current ratios of the NDRs is not so large and 
it could be more remarkable as reducing the 
measurement temperature. 
The corresponding conduction band 
diagrams at B-E junction of the studied 
SE-RTBT are depicted in Fig. 6. Because an 
n-InGaAs layer inserted between superlattice 
and base layer is thin, the superlattice emitter 
is depleted completely and the depletion 
region of B-E junction extends into 
n+-InGaAs cap layer at equilibrium, as 
illustrated in Fig. 6(a). At low B-E voltage 
level, corresponding to low IB current, the 
applied VBE is essentially across the B-E 
junction and the device behaves as the 
traditional HBTs. By increasing the VBE level, 
the depletion width decreases and the neutral 
n-InGaAs emitter region will appear. Once the 
applied VBE is large enough, the flat-band 
condition is developed and the resonant 
tunneling behavior among the InP/InGaAs 
superlattice may occur, as shown in Fig. 6(b). 
From the transmission probabilities, it is 
known that two quantized energy states are 
demonstrated in the five-period InP/InGaAs 
superlattice structure, as seen in Figs. 2 and 3. 
The ground band E0 ranges between 49 and 
55 meV and the first excited band E1 ranges 
between 190 and 233 meV under ideal 
flat-band condition. As VBE increases beyond 
the flat-band voltage, the first NDR is 
observed. However, the applied VBE voltage 
of the studied device must be large enough to 
attain the flat-band condition attributed to the 
thin n-InGaAs emitter layer when compared 
with previously reported SE-RTBTs [8,9]. 
Furthermore, as the collector electrode is open, 
at least there are three obvious N-shaped 
NDR phenomena observed as seen in Fig. 5, 
though only two minibands exist in the 
superlattice regime. Thus, it is believed that 
the RT mechanism of the multiple NDR is 
dominated by high-field domain.   
In the device, the high-field domain is 
initially formed in the first superlattice period 
near the high-doping n+-InGaAs cap layer, 
which is less depleted. In other words, another 
RT will occur through the high-field region in 
the first superlattice period near the 
n+-InGaAs cap layer and the low field region 
spreads over other superlattice periods, as 
shown in Fig. 6(c). Then, the next NDR 
phenomenon will occur. Further increasing 
the ΔVBE will cause the extension of high 
field region into the adjacent superlattice 
period. This also breaks off another quantum 
well from the above RT condition, and gives 
another oscillatory behavior as seen in Fig. 
6(d). Under the sequential RT, based on the 
increase of VBE voltage, the interesting 
multiple NDRs could be expected to occur. It 
is worthy to note that the voltage difference 
ΔVBE (~ 0.22 V) between two NDRs is nearly 
identical, which means that the strength 
difference of high-field voltage is identical.

efficiently lower the energy band structure at 
emitter side for reducing the undesired offset 
voltage.  
Significantly, the transistor performance 
incorporating anomalous and sequential 
N-shaped NDRs are observed. The superlattice 
provides the RT channels for electrons by the 
considerable ΔEc at the heterojunction. 
Because the applied B-E voltage has to be 
large enough to occur tunneling behaviors, it 
can be found that the NDR regions appear at 
saturation region in the experimental I-V curve, 
i.e., the B-E and base-collector (B-C) 
junctions are under forward-bias conductions. 
At constant base current, the forward-bias VBE 
increases and the VCB decreases as increasing 
the VCE (= VCB + VBE). The increase of VBE 
will cause the sequential RT behaviors, i.e., the 
negative differential output conductance in the 
collector current.  
 
四、 結論與討論 
In summary, a functional InP/InGaAs 
SE-RTBT has been successfully fabricated. 
Attributed to the creation and extension of 
high-field domain by the weakly coupled in 
the InP/InGaAs superlattice, the interesting 
multiple N-shaped NDRs at room temperature 
is observed. The tunneling mechanism 
corresponding to the InGaAs QW and the InP 
barrier is demonstrated by numerical 
calculation. In addition, the thin n-InGaAs 
emitter layer between base and superlattice 
helps to lower the energy band structure at the 
emitter side and reduce the potential spike. 
Transistor performances with a high current 
gain and a low C-E offset voltage are achieved. 
Consequently, the demonstrated structure 
provides a good potential for signal amplifiers 
and multiple-valued logic circuit applications.
