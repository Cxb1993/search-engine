ABSTRACT
Currently, thermoelectric (TE) material is a kind
of semiconductor which transfers heat energy into
electrical energy due to Seebeck effect. Thermal
energy can be transferred by such a device to convert
into the electrical current without assistance of an
engine. The advantages of thermal-electrical
conversion include high reliability, no noise, no
vibration, low mass, and environmental friendly.
In this study, the theoretical and numerical
models were prior to investigate the fundamental
concepts of the TE materials. Next, we aimed to focus
on the experimental measurements for the single chip
and module of TEG. The thermal and electrical
characteristics were investigated to verify the
feasibility of the theoretical and numerical models.
Certainly, the experimental data was used to facilitate
the optimum design of TE devices.
Finally, thermal-electric generator (TEG) system,
consisted of a solar water heater (SWH), TEG
modules, the dissipation sinks and a heat pipe,
respectively, was designed to generate electricity by
using the solar water heater. The cold side of the TEG
system was mounted onto a fluid-flow channel with
the convection heat sink for the dissipating thermal
energy. Conversely, the hot side of that was also
mounted onto a fluid-flow channel connected with a
heat pipe by transporting the hot water supplied by
SWH device. Principally, the temperature difference
between two sides could yield the TEG system to
convert thermal heat to electric power. The results
will enable the establishment of foundations for a
TEG system and then to design such a TEG system.
In the future, the TEG devices are not only to provide
hot water, but also to generate the electric power.

1. 1. INTRODUCTION
Currently, rapid draining of fossil fuel, skyrocketing
of oil price, and greenhouse effect (i.e., mass
production of carbon dioxide) has haunted the earth
and become the most important global issue.
Therefore, renewable energy has attracted more
enthusiastically attentions, which includes solar energy
included thermal and photovoltaic, wind power
generator, and biomass fuel, etc. They are considered
as the most appropriately solution. Not only they have
virtually unlimited source but also environmentally
friendly.
Thermoelectric generation technology, as one
entirely solid-state energy conversion way, can directly
convert thermal energy into electricity by using
thermoelectric materials. A thermoelectric power
generator has no moving parts, and is compact, quiet,
highly reliable and environmentally friendly. Due to
these merits, this generation technology is presently
becoming a noticeable research direction. In principle,
TEG technology can directly convert thermal energy
into electricity by using thermoelectric materials.
However, wide application of thermoelectric power
generation has been limited because of its relatively
3Figure 2 (a) Schematic diagram of a pair of P- and
N-type pillars and (b)diagram of thermal circuit
analogy.
A general thermoelectric generator with a load
resistance (RL) connected is composed of several
thermoelectric elements). Each element consists of P-
and N-type semiconductor legs which work between
high and low temperature heat sources whose
temperature are TH and TL, respectively. QH and QL in
Fig. 2 (a) present the heat absorbs from high
temperature reservoir and the heat releases to low
temperature reservoir, respectively, that is, the heatﬂux
between the generator and the two heat reservoirs.
Owing to Peltier efect, the heat ﬂux each 
thermoelectric element of the generator (one pair of P-
and N-type legs) absorbs from high temperature
reservoir (QH) and releases to low temperature
reservoir (QL). The Seebeck voltage can be shown as
follows:
)( 21 TTV M  (1)
where T1 and T2 are hot-side and cold-side temperature
of the generator,αP andαNare the Seebeck coefﬁcients 
of the P- and N-type semiconductor legs respectively,
and αM is presented as αM=αP －αN. TEG’s total
Seebeck voltage can be calculated as

According to analyze for thermal resistance
analogy, a heat flux is induced by the temperature
difference between both ends of the thermoelectric
element, thermal resistance expressed (Fig.2(b))by

material, respectively. If heat transfer is no loss in the
process, the heat ﬂux (Q) in the legs is carried from
hot-side to cold-side, (i.e., Q=QH=QL) (T1-T2) can be
expressed by

The theoretical analysis of open circuit voltage,
short circuit current, maximum output power, and
maximum converted efficiency with the different
temperatures were then verified by experimental
measurements. In the aspect of TEG efficiency, we pay
more attention to the thermal efficiency of the TE
generator, not the whole energy efficiency at present.
This is not only because the amount of heat in this
study is more difficult to measure and evaluate than
electric power, but also because the heat utilized here
is assumed to be no-cost. Therefore, the inﬂuence of
Peltier and Thomson effect could be ignored in this
analysis.
5Figure 3.The numerical simulation for the distributed
contours of (a) temperature; (b) potential; and (c)
current density and current flow, respectively.
In order to observe the Seebeck/Peltier effect, a
series of theoretical calculations and numerical
simulations were performed for the different
temperature values. Figure 4 shows comparison of
change in temperature calculated from equations (6),
(9) and (10) to the simulated one based on the material
properties of the semiconductors. Certainly, the voltage
and current obtained for the two calculations was
found to be linear. The voltage of theoretical
calculations is in a good agreement with that of the
simulation. However, the current and power of
theoretical are reasonably higher than that of the
numerical values. The reason is that the properties of
the materials were found to largely influence the
performance of the Peltier effect. In addition the
difference in the theoretical calculated and numerical
simulated values could be due to some of the
assumptions related to heat transfer mechanisms.

results of (a) voltage; (b) current; and (c)power varies

the design of the experimental setup is proposed for
testing and verifying the capability of thermoelectric

is shown in Figure 5. This platform includes heat
conduction board module, heat control system, load
system, heat sink system, data acquisition system and
control interface. Within this system, a full real time

7Some measuring instruments are equipped to
construct this experimental setup as shown in Figure 5.
A constant temperature water bath (temperature range:
25~100 oC) is adopted to controlled the thermal ﬂuid, 
that is, applying this hot water bath to simulate waste
heat ﬂow. Two heat sink (base size: 4 cm by 4 cm) are
mounted to enhance heat transfer or dissipation on
hot-side or cold-side of the TEG element. The hot side
of a TEG element was immerged into the hot water
tanks. The hot water temperature was changed by
thermal digital controller to precisely control the
temperature range of 25~100oC. The heat flux of the
TEG cold side is force convection by heat sink with
water-flow cooling type. The cold water was pumped
from the cold water bath to dissipate the cold heat. The
cold water temperature was carefully set to be 1, 10
and 25oC, respectively.
The thermoelectric voltage, current, and output
power with the driving different hot temperatures were
shown as Figure 8. As we expected, it was clearly seen
that the induced voltage, current, and output power
were increased with the operated hot temperatures. The
voltage and current were linearly increased with the
operated hot temperatures. However, the power is
quadratic increased with the operated hot temperatures.
Certainly, compared with the cold side temperature, the
induced voltage, current, and power was higher as the
cold temperature of 1oC. Obviously, the output powers
were experimentally measured as 4.8, 3.4 and 2.8W
relatively for the cold temperatures of 1, 10, and 25 oC,
respectively.
Results of theoretic analysis compared with the
experimental data are shown in Fig. 8 simultaneously,
based on TEG analysis model established before, with
Seebeck coeficient α=2.0×10-4VK-1, thermal
conductance k = 1.5 WK-1 and electric resistance R =
3.12 Ω. It is clearly shownthat theoretical curves
reasonably coincide with experimental data, whether in
the qualitative aspect or the quantitative one. That is to
say, reasonability of the TEG analysis model has been
veriﬁed, so that we can use this model to guide 
analysis and optimization of this setup. According to
circuit theory, maximum power output of this TEG can
be attained when inner resistance of 3.12Ω. As a
consequence, it is convenient to calculate a series of
setup maximum power output values changing with
temperature difference based on data measured
previously.
These figures also reveal that the voltage, current,
and power are function of the temperature difference.
As shown in Fig.8(c), TEG maximum power output
increases while temperature difference is increasing,
especially in a quadratic trend.

side of that will also mounted onto a fluid channel to
transfer the solar heat source form the solar water
heater tank by a heat pipe (referred to figure 11(a)).
Principally, the temperature difference between two
sides will yield the TEG system to generate electric
power. Thus, the higher thermal-electric converted
efficiency is dependent on the temperature difference
of the both side. The solar water heater and TEG
system are demonstrated in figures 11(b) and (c),
respectively. Presently, we achieved as the open circuit
voltage ~50.0 V, the short circuit current ~0.5 A, then
the maximum output power around 25.0 W at the
condition of hot water and cold water temperatures are
50oC and 28oC, respectively.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The thermoelectric generator setup using the
water temperature difference has been constructed. At
the same time, a theoretic analysis and numerical
model based on fundamental TEG effects and the heat
transfer irreversibility has been successfully
demonstrated. The comparison of results between
theoretic analysis, numerical simulations and
experiment has approved the reasonability in this study.
Therefore, this theoretical and numerical model can be
then used in performance optimization, integrated with
experiment, and advanced design and application of
thermoelectric generation. The promising potential of
using thermoelectric generator for temperature
difference, particularly in solar water heater, is also
demonstrated by the results of theoretic analysis and
experiment. Meanwhile, the results show that heat
transfer reversibility does affect thermoelectric
generator performance, and reversibility in cold-side
heat transfer of this setup is the bottle-neck to enhance
system performance. By means of integrating theoretic
analysis and experiment, it is found that besides
increasing water temperature difference and TE
modules in series, expanding heat sink surface area in a
proper range and enhancing cold-side heat transfer
capacity in a proper range can also be employed to
enhance performance of this setup. Further work is
planned to conduct a system level optimization study,
concerning both energy efﬁciency and system power 
capacity, and develop a new TEG device employing
solar water heater technology in a more effective
manner for the potential of TE generator.

目前太陽能熱水器只能用於洗澡，且熱水溫度僅須 50度左右，但此溫度對於使用此
套熱電系統發電，產生的發電電力效率不高，如何提高當前太陽能熱水器熱水溫度，
且又不會讓洗澡水溫太高，是一個值得探討問題。若組立安裝本熱電系統設備，則太
陽能熱水器不僅可以用於洗澡，也可以利用其儲存之熱/冷水流進/出熱電系統，透過
熱致電模組冷熱面溫差，產生一定量的發電，供日常生活中使用。目前熱電發電系統
最大的問題是熱能轉換電能的效率，而發電效率要高，則其熱冷面之溫差要大，溫度
要控制在一定的溫差。本熱電發電系統裝置的已申請中華民國與大陸的新型專利許
可，並且已經成功地分別製造與組立熱電系統與太陽能熱水器，並進行此系統模組實

可行性，未來藉由此計畫的開發，進而開模量產商品化。
