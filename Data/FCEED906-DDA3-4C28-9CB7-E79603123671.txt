ABSTRACT  
 
The presence of more than one heavy metal in wastewater probably caused interactive 
effects as influenced by different factors. This study illustrates the adsorption of heavy metals 
in single-ion and multi-ion systems using composite material as adsorbents. A novel and 
spherical beads were synthesized thru blending of chitosan and montmorillionite. 
Comparative and competitive tests were employed to deduce adsorption mechanism and 
adsorbent selectivity for Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+. Uptake of divalent metal ions was 
determined based on experimental parameters like initial concentration, adsorbent loading, 
and crosslinking with EGDE. Batch experiments were executed at 25 0C, agitation speed of 
50 rpm and contact time of 5 hrs. Working conditions were set in an acidic industrial set-up 
of pH 4 and in dilute quantities ranging from 5.00 to 200.00 mg/l. Data revealed a strong

methodology was purposely designed to determine whether the divalent metal cations on both 
systems are effectively adsorbed onto the beads. However, understanding of metal removal 
from aqueous medium is empirical because of the complex structure and composition of 
chitosan-montmorillionite composite beads. Likewise, the effectiveness in removing 
several  cationic heavy metals using the new adsorbents depends on many process 
variables and their specific combinations.  
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
This section presents the materials and describes the experimental methods applied in the 
study. It also provides theoretical basis as to the analytical aspect of this undertaking. 
 
2.1 Chemicals and Reagents 
 
Low-molecular weight powdered Chitosan (MW 340.3322 g/mole extracted from crab 
shells) with 75-85% degree of deactelytion and viscosity of 20.000 cP was procured from 
ALDRICH® of Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (USA). Commercial Riedel-de Haen Bentonite (as 
Montmorillionite), solid NaOH, HCl fuming 37%, ICP multi- element standard solution 
IV from Merck (Germany),  Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5H2O, Pb(NO3)2 , Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O,  and 
Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O were used  in  the experiments.  
 
2.2 Stock solution, standards and synthetic effluents 
 
Stock solution for the calibration curve of Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission 
Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was prepared as indicated: 10 mL of 1000mg/L of ICP multi- 
element standard diluted to 100 ml. Different volumes were pipetted in obtaining the desired 
standard concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/l). Synthetic effluents for Cu2+, Pb2+, 
Ni2+ and Zn2+ .were prepared with concentration ranges from 5.00 to 200.00 mg/l and then 
adjusted to pH 4. Deionized water (resistance of 18.0 M𝛺 cm) was used in all solution 
preparations and analysis.  
 
2.3 Synthesis of composite beads 
 
A novel adsorbent known as chitosan-montmorillionite composite (ChiMC) and 
crosslinked chitosan-montmorillionite composite (CChiMC) were synthesized in a 1:20 mass 
ratio forming into spherical beads. Four aspects were vital in the preparation like the 
following: (1) chitosan dissolution with HCl, (2) blending of dissolved chitosan with 
commercial montmorillionite, (3) neutralization and precipitation with NaOH, and (4) 
consolidated physical preparation of beads including drying, grinding, sieving and storage. In 
the crosslinking process, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) was used. 
 
2.4 Batch Adsorption studies 
 
This  experimentation  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  adsorption  efficiency  of  the 
synthesized composite  beads  in a static or batch manner. Specific amount (m) of dried 
adsorbents in grams and 30 ml (v) of the synthetic solution as adsorbates were placed in 
50-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Samples were agitated in a reciprocating shaker with speed of 50 
rpm, temperature at 25 0C, and contact time of 5 hrs.  After equilibration, it was then filtered 
for quantitative analysis of the filtrates.

corresponding to certain standards. Adsorption is favorable if Rl values are between 0 and 1(0 
< Rl < 1), unfavorable (Rl > 1), irreversible (Rl =0), and linear (Rl = 1) (Sari et al., 2007). 
    𝑅𝑙 =  1(1 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝐶𝑒)                                                          𝐄𝐪. (𝟒) 
 
The Freundlich isotherm is used for a heterogeneous surface energy system (Annadurai 
et al., 2008). The linearized form for analysis was given as:  
 log𝑄𝑒   = log𝐾𝑓 + 1𝑛 log𝐶𝑒                                               𝐄𝐪. (𝟓) 
 
where Kf  and n are the Freundlich empirical constants; Ce, is the equilibrium liquid phase 
(adsorbate) concentration (mg/l) and Qe is the solid phase (adsorbent) ion concentration or 
the adsorption capacity (mg/g) (Igwe and Abia ). 
 
The pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models were used to test or 
check experimental data which provides insights on the mechanism of adsorption of M2+ 
ions onto the beads.  
 
As developed by Ho and McKay (1998), the pseudo-first order equation of Lagergen is 
generally expressed in integrated form as follows:  
 log(𝑞𝑒 − 𝑞𝑡) = log 𝑞𝑒 − 𝐾12.303   𝑡                                       𝐄𝐪. (𝟔) 
 
where K1 is the rate constant, qe and qt are sorption capacity at equilibrium and time (t), 
respectively. The pseudo-second order kinetic rate equation in linear form is: 
 
𝑡
𝑞𝑡
  = 1
𝐾2 𝑞𝑒2 + 1𝑞𝑡                                                           𝐄𝐪. (𝟕) 
 
where 𝐾2 is the rate constant, qe and qt are the amounts of solute adsorbed by adsorbent at 
equilibrium and time (t), respectively. The pseudo-second order kinetic model is based on 
the assumption that chemical adsorption or chemisorption is the rate-limiting step 
involving valency forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and 
adsorbate (Sag and Aktay, 2002). 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1 Surface properties of adsorbents 
 
The surface area of the different bead components was verified by the BET method. The 
Zeta-potential at pH 4 was also determined which explains the net surface charge of the 
adsorbent. Comparison of values obtained in the analysis is summarized in Table 1. As 
presented in the table, montmorillionite has the highest negative surface charge of (-) 15.90 
and the highest surface area of 94.28 m2/g.  
 
Chitosan portrayed lowest values of (-) 0.228 and 3.40 m2/g for the net charge and 
surface area, respectively. After blending the two components as ChiMC beads, there was

3.2 Characterization and elemental analysis 
 
Figure 2 (a & b) represents the spectra of the synthesized adsorbents using energy-
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The ChiMC and CChiMC beads exhibited similar 
components and they only vary for the respective weight (wt) and atomic (at) percents of the 
different elements detected.

Table 2 revealed the elemental analysis of chitosan-montmorillionite blending followed 
by crosslinking with EGDE. Biopolymer chitosan has good miscibility with montmorillionite 
owed to its hydrophilic and polycationic nature (Wang et al 2005). Moreover, based on a 
related study by Wan et. al (2010), the major elements of chitoson in weight percent are C 
(35.76%) and O (64.24%) .

After the blending process, ChiMC beads contain C (2.66%), O (51.50%), Si (25.12%), 
Al (10.26%) and other elements in trace amount which indicates that aggregation of the 
composite material was evident. The surprising decrease of C signifies the intercalation of 
chitosan monolayers in the montmorillionite substrate. Additionally, the slight change in O 
can also be ascribed to its binding reaction with montmorillionite. Clay structure particularly

complements with the assumption of synergetic effect exhibited by the ions.  
A ternary system was set-up in the absence of Pb2+ to test its supposed influence. 
Adsorbent selectivity was found consistent in the order Cu>Zn>Ni. However, uptake of all 
heavy metals lessened thus confirmed the control of Pb2+ on the adsorption process. The result 
further suggests that preference  exhibited by the composite beads for  Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and 
Ni2+ was backed by the metallic properties of the adsorbates like the following: (1) ionic radius, 
(2) ionic potential, (3) atomic number and atomic weight, (4)  softness  and  hardness  value,  
(5)  electronic  configuration,  and  (6)  coordination number. 
 
Table 5 summarizes the essential parameters of the metallic properties. The reversed 
order of Cu and Zn in the multi-ion system may be attributed to the coordination number of 
the metals and its water of hydration. The nitrate-based Pb2+ synthetic solution was 
prepared from anhydrous salt of Pb(NO3)2. Since Pb has a minimum coordination 
number of four, it can accommodate more ions for complexation and probably led other 
ions to the active sites for adsorption to happen.

Other aqueous M2+ ions are hydrated like Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5H2O, Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O  and 
Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O and the hydrates possibly influenced its complex formation and H-bonding 
interaction. Cu2+ with some water of hydration attached to it has a coordination number of 
four to form tetrahedral complexes. Though Zn2+and Ni2+ behaved similarly, but six 
water molecules were already bound to it. Most likely, only H-bonding occurred for Zn 
and Ni ions and it actually manifested in the obtained selectivity series:  Pb2+ >Cu2+ >Zn2+ 
~Ni2+. 
 
3.6 Adsorption Isotherms 
 
The data in Table 6 provided good fit to both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms 
with correlation coefficients (R2) > 0.90. All the ions favorably adsorbed onto the beads as 
indicated by the values of n>1 (Buenos et al., 2008) suggesting that adsorption of M2+ was 
non-uniform and non-specific. This was due to the synthesized beads’ diversity and 
heterogeneity of negative sites available for bonding. Additionally, the dimensionless 
parameter (Rl) which is a more reliable indicator of the Langmuir equation has values < 1 
which further signifies an encouraging adsorption to the model. It has been noted though 
 
 
 14 
Apart from complexation, ion-exchange mechanism probably influenced the adsorption 
behavior of all the divalent metal ions due to increase of respective pH levels after the 
adsorption process, show as Table 8. Before equilibration, HCl was added to the solution to 
attain acidic condition of pH 4.

The H+ competed with the metal ions (M2+) for the adsorption sites during the metal-
adsorbent interaction. The adsorbent is believed to be in protonated form thus leaving the 
solution pH slightly increased after contact with the beads. The amine group (-NH2) of 
chitosan is easily protonated to form –NH3 in acidic solutions (Chiou and Li 2003). At higher 
concentration, the very slight change in pH maybe attributed to the fierce competition of M2+ 
ions to the adsorbent thus lesser H+ removal from the solution indicating minor attraction of 
the latter to the active sites. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
 
The synthesized composite beads demonstrated high potential of removing several M2+ 
ions from synthetic wastewater aside from being alternative and inexpensive. Its sample 
source from a seafood processing waste intermingled with a readily available support of 
geological origin made this adsorbent economical and environment- friendly.  
 
Results of this work suggest that selectivity of the ChiMC and CChiMC beads for the 
targeted heavy metals viz. Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ was influenced by the periodic 
properties of the adsorbates. Moreover, the mechanisms of adsorption are believed to be a 
combination of complexation, chemical sorption and ion-exchange.

containing many reactive sites (Wan et al., 2004). Unfortunately, the bottleneck of its 
solubility at low pH, gel forming behavior in aqueous solutions, and mass transfer limitations 
create drawbacks for developing its commercial application (Rangel-Mendez et al., 2009). It 
is therefore necessary to coat chitosan on other materials to provide physical support or to 
intermingle it with other adsorbents to form a firm composition of better strength. The process 
will improve both the chemical and mechanical stability of chitosan making it more durable to 
withstand the application pressures. Moreover, this will also increase the accessibility of the 
metal binding sites (Babel and Kurniawan, 2004; Gotoh et al., 2004; Nonambhay and 
Palanisary, 2005; Gecol et al., 2006).   
 
Clay, particularly montmorillionite, has also attracted attention over the past decade as an 
efficient adsorbent. Its sorption capabilities come from their high surface area and exchange 
capacities (Bhattacharyya and Gupta, 2008; Babel and Kurniawan, 2003). It is also considered 
as a practical adsorbent since it is easily available and comparatively cost less.  
 
To date, there is scarcity of references using clay as a readily available support for chitosan. 
The manner of chitosan blending with natural material such as montmorillionite is a vital 
concern to be addressed by this innovative work since its chemical structure can be easily 
modified. Moreover, the components are certainly  obtainable and abundant in many areas 
like the Asian countries since chitosan is produced from an  array  of  fishery  wastes  while  
montmorillionite  is  naturally  occurring.  In this context, the present work will have 
noteworthy involvement for the promotion of a green technology and engineering of heavy 
metal remediation from wastewater. 
 
In this study, synthetic effluents were used to test the adsorption properties of the synthesized 
composite beads in single-ion and multi-ion systems. The experimental methodology was 
purposely designed to determine whether the divalent metal cations on both systems are 
effectively adsorbed onto the beads. However, understanding of metal removal from aqueous 
medium is empirical because of the complex structure and composition of chitosan-
montmorillionite composite beads. Likewise, the effectiveness in removing several cationic 
heavy metals using the new adsorbents depends on many process variables and their specific 
combinations. 
 
2.  MATERIAL AND EXPERIMENT 
 
2.1 Chemicals and Reagents 
 
Low-molecular weight powdered Chitosan (MW 340.3322 g/mole extracted from crab shells) 
with 75-85% degree of deactelytion and viscosity of 20.000 cP was procured from 
ALDRICH® of Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (USA). Commercial Riedel-de Haen Bentonite (as 
Montmorillionite), solid NaOH, HCl fuming 37%, ICP multi- element standard solution IV 
from Merck (Germany),  Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5H2O, Pb(NO3)2 , Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O,  and 
Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O were used  in  the experiments.  
 
2.2 Stock solution, standards and synthetic effluents 
 
Stock solution for the calibration curve of Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission 
Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was prepared as indicated: 10 mL of 1000mg/L of ICP multi- 
element standard diluted to 100 ml. Different volumes were pipetted in obtaining the desired 
standard concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/l). Synthetic effluents for Cu2+, Pb2+,

The percent adsorption was determined using Eq. (2): 
 
 
 
At a specific temperature and pH, the adsorption equilibrium is typically expressed by an 
isotherm equation whose parameters illustrate the surface properties and affinity of the 
adsorbent (Gupta & Bhattacharyya 2008). In this work, the isotherm constants deliberated 
were Kl, b, Qe, Rl, n, and Kf obtained from the linearized equations of the models.  
 
Langmuir theory assumes that sorption takes place at specific sites within the adsorbent 
(Annadurai et al 2008) and the isotherm was expressed as: 
 
 
 
Qe, max can be interpreted as the total number of binding sites that are available for 
adsorption, and Qe as the number of binding sites that are in fact occupied by the adsorbate at 
the equilibrium concentration, Ce, mg/l. (Volesky). The constant b and a dimensionless 
constant ( ) were considered here to find out the feasibility of Langmuir isotherm 
corresponding to certain standards. Adsorption is favorable if Rl values are between 0 and 1(0 
< Rl < 1), unfavorable (Rl > 1), irreversible (Rl =0), and linear (Rl = 1) (Sari et al., 2007). 
 
 
 
The Freundlich isotherm is used for a heterogeneous surface energy system (Annadurai et al., 
2008). The linearized form for analysis was given as:  
 
 
 
where Kf  and n are the Freundlich empirical constants; Ce, is the equilibrium liquid phase 
(adsorbate) concentration (mg/l) and Qe is the solid phase (adsorbent) ion concentration or the 
adsorption capacity (mg/g). 
 
The pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models were used to test or check 
experimental data which provides insights on the mechanism of adsorption of M2+ ions onto 
the beads. As developed by Ho and McKay (1998), the pseudo-first order equation of 
Lagergen is generally expressed in integrated form as follows:  
 
 
 
where K1 is the rate constant, qe and qt are sorption capacity at equilibrium and time (t), 
respectively. The pseudo-second order kinetic rate equation in linear form is:

3.4 Adsorbent Selectivity for Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ni2+ 
 
The selectivity sequence was evaluated by means of distribution coefficients (Kd) which 
represent the affinity of M2+ ions (in aqueous medium) for the adsorbent. Kd values were 
calculated as the ratio of the equilibrium metal concentration adsorbed (Qe) to equilibrium 
metal concentration in the added solution (Ce). High values of Kd signify that the metal has 
been retained by the solid phase through sorption and  chemica l  reactions, while low 
values indicate that a large fraction of the metal remains in solution (Gomes et al., 2001; 
Usman, 2008).  
 
In Table 3, adsorption order was derived and extent of binding was simultaneously shown. In 
terms of Kd(200) values, M2+ in single-ion system followed the sequence:  Pb>>Zn>Cu>Ni. It 
is evident that Pb2+ exhibited superiority to other ions and an enormous affinity to the 
composite beads. Likewise, the obtained selectivity series of the multi-ion system emerged 
Pb>Cu>Zn>Ni with Cu2+ and Zn2+ exchanging places. Based on the data, Pb2+ remained 
dominant and probably guided other ions to the adsorption sites. The result complements with 
the assumption of synergetic effect exhibited by the ions.

metal concentration of 200 mg/l

Ni 2+ 0.098 1.652 0.828 
Order Pb>>Zn>Cu>Ni Pb>Cu>Zn>Ni Cu>Zn>Ni 
 
A ternary system was set-up in the absence of Pb2+ to test its supposed influence. Adsorbent 
selectivity was found consistent in the order Cu>Zn>Ni. However, uptake of all heavy metals 
lessened thus confirmed the control of Pb2+ on the adsorption process. The result further 
suggests that preference   exhibited by the  compos i te  beads  for  Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and 
Ni2+ was backed by the metallic properties of the adsorbates like the following: (1) ionic radius, 
(2) ionic potential, (3) atomic number and atomic weight, (4)  softness  and  hardness  value,  
(5)  electronic  configuration,  and  (6)  coordination number. 
 
2011 International Conference on Sustainable Environmental Technologies,  
July 11-12, 2011, Seoul, Korea 
 
Additionally, the dimensionless parameter (Rl) which is a more reliable indicator of the 
Langmuir equation has values < 1 which further signifies an encouraging adsorption to the 
model. It has been noted though that most adsorbates predominantly pursued the empirical 
Freundlich isotherm (with higher R2) which is valid to non-specific adsorption to a 
heterogeneous surface. Conversely, Pb2+ showed preference to Langmuir model which is also 
justified by its adsorption behavior either in the absence or presence of Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ni2+. 
 
3.7 Adsorption Mechanism 
 
The mechanism of adsorption was probed by employing the pseudo-first order and pseudo-
second order kinetic models. Experimental data for the systems is presented in Table 6. The 
correlation coefficients (R2) for the first-order kinetic model were inferior compared to the 
pseudo-second order.  Also, the calculated Qe values failed to provide reasonable outcome 
which are too low in comparison to the experimental Qe values. The pseudo-second order 
kinetic was concluded predominant because of higher R2 values (>0.95). The results 
complement with the calculated values (Qe, cal) of the reaction which manifested good 
agreement with experimental results (Qe, expt). This implies that adsorption of M2+ ions onto 
the composite beads is satisfactorily a pseudo-second order and definitely not a pseudo-first 
order reaction. The  rate  controlling  step  therefore  is  predicted  to  be  chemical  sorption, 
rather than mass transfer, which  may involve  valency forces through sharing or exchange of 
electrons between the divalent ions and the adsorbent.

4. CONCLUSION 
 
The synthesized composite beads demonstrated high potential of removing several M2+ ions 
from synthetic wastewater aside from being alternative and inexpensive. Its sample source 
from a seafood processing waste intermingled with a readily available support of geological 
origin made this adsorbent economical and environment- friendly.  
 
Results of this work suggest that selectivity of the ChiMC and CChiMC beads for the targeted 
heavy metals viz. Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ was influenced by the periodic properties of the 
adsorbates. Moreover, the mechanisms of adsorption are believed to be a combination of 
complexation, chemical sorption and ion-exchange.
