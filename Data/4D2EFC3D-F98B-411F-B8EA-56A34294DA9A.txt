一、中英文摘要及關鍵詞 
本計畫旨在建立一低成本且高穩定性與靈敏度之電流式葡萄糖感測器，並將其應用於
生質酒精製程中纖維素醣化與發酵反應之即時監控。為了達成此目的，我們創新使用
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/普魯士藍(PB)之有機/無機雙層膜結構，做為網印
碳電極上高效能的葡萄糖氧化酵素(GOD)固定層。首先，PB 薄膜被電鍍於軟性塑膠基材的
網印碳電極用以感測葡萄糖氧化產生之過氧化氫，並且經過 100 ℃烘烤增進 PB 於中性環
境中之穩定性，而 PEDOT 薄膜被電聚合於 PB 上用以包覆 GOD。在 pH 7.4 磷酸鹽緩衝溶
液中，施加-0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl)電位對葡萄糖進行電流式感測，實驗結果指出此感測器可偵
測到 sub-mM 到 mM 範圍的葡萄糖並且還有改善空間。而我們也成功的偵測到利用酵素醣
化纖維素後得到的葡萄糖，此葡萄糖濃度可做為纖維素降解生質酒精燃料製程之監控指標。
此外，本感測器在保存長達一個月後依然可工作。基於以上，我們認為此新型 PEDOT/PB
葡萄糖感測器不只是化學觀點上的創新，在生物能源與生醫領域中皆有其應用的價值。

This study aims to develop a cost-effective but highly durable and sensitive amperometric 
glucose sensor for real-time monitoring of biomass saccharification, which is an essential process 
for bioethanol production. To this purpose, we investigated the use of a novel organic/inorganic 
bilayer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/Prussian blue (ferric hexacyanoferrate, 
namely PB), as an enhanced immobilization layer of glucose oxidase (GOD) on a carbon paste 
electrode. The PB layer was electrodeposited onto carbon/PET first to detect H2O2 resulted from 
glucose oxidation; the PEDOT layer was electropolymerized atop PB to entrap glucose oxidase 
(GOD). The stability of PB in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was achieved by a heat 
treatment at 100 ℃. Accordingly, our amperometric sensing experiment was performed by 
applying a constant potential of -0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the sensor was tested with a dilution 
series of glucose solutions in the presence of phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The experimental results 
verified that such a novel sensor could successfully detect glucose within sub-mM to several mM 
range, which can be further improved. Although the optimization of this sensor assembly is still 
undergoing, we have found that it can simultaneously detect glucose production in a reaction 
mixture of enzymatic cellulose saccharification, which is very crucial to produce cellulosic 
ethanol fuel. Besides, at least 1-month at-rest stability of such a sensor has been observed. 
Therefore, we consider this new design of glucose sensor based on the PEDOT/PB bilayer is not 
only novel from the chemistry aspect but also promising for both bioenergy and biomedical 
applications. 
Keywords: Prussian blue; PEDOT; amperometric glucose sensor; glucose oxidase 
Malinauskas, 2000b), has been coated on the PB surface to serve as a protective layer and a 
matrix for GOD entrapment at the same time. In addition, when PB forms a composite with a 
conducting polymer such as PAni and PPy, the synergistic electrochemistry is observed (Hong et 
al., 2008). Thus, the conducting polymer-PB composite has been an interesting topic for the 
biosensor field (Karyakin and Chaplin 1994, Garjonyte and Malinauskas, 2000a, 2000b; Zou et 
al., 2007; Ernst et al. 2007).  
As compared to the cases of PAni/PB and PPy/PB, little literature about the application of 
the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-PB composite to a biosensor has reported so far 
(Ernst et al. 2007). Moreover, no literature reports a glucose sensor based on the PEDOT/PB 
composite, although PEDOT is anticipated to have several promising advantages in addition to 
entrapment of GOD and protection of PB. For instance, PEDOT can be electropolymerized in a 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4) that helps to maintain GOD’s activity while entrapping 
GOD (Piro et al., 2001; Fabiano et al., 2002; Nien et al. 2006; Nien et al. 2008). Besides, PEDOT 
has been proven to own better aqueous stability and biocompatibility than PPy and PAni, so it is 
considered a promising polymer appropriate for continuous sensing and even in vivo implantation 
(Kros et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2008). For these reasons, this work targets a high-performance 
glucose sensing electrode based on the PEDOT/PB bilayer. Fabrication of a PEDOT/PB bilayer 
enzyme electrode with high operating stability in PBS, pH 7.4 is studied and discussed from both 
the macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints. 
 
四、研究方法 
To assemble this amperometric glucose sensor, the carbon paste electrode (active area = 
0.283 cm2) was screen printed onto a flexible polyester substrate at first. Then a PB thin film was 
electrodeposited on the carbon paste electrode as a solid mediator to carry out the electrocatalysis 
of hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct indicating the glucose oxidation. Subsequently, a PEDOT thin 
film was electropolymerized on the PB-modified SPCE in the presence of GOD. As a 
consequence, glucose oxidase molecules were entrapped in the PEDOT matrix atop the PB 
modified SCPE electrode. Throughout the sensing experiments, a homemade flow-injection 
analysis (FIA) system was employed to demonstrate amperometric glucose sensing with the 
enzyme electrode. In addition, the chronoamperometric signals in response to sequential addition 
of pure glucose samples, cellulose-hydrolysis samples and human serum samples were collected 
to evaluate the sensing performance and applications of the enzyme electrode. 
A. Preparation of a PB-modified SPCE 
At first, conductive carbon paste was screen-printed onto a flexible PET (polyethylene 
terephthalate) sheet with the designed pattern to form a screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). 
Subsequently, the SPCE was baked at 100 oC for 2 h. Electrodeposition of a PB thin film on the 
SPCE (active area = 0.283 cm2) was done by applying a constant potential of 600 mV (vs. 
Ag/AgCl) for 60 s. The PB deposition bath was composed of 2 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 2 mM FeCl3, 0.1 
五、結果與討論 
Figure 2(a) presents the CV curves of the enzyme electrode for different H2O2 
concentrations. The data suggest that the presence of an outer PEDOT layer does not interfere 
with H2O2 reduction at the inner PB layer. Also, it shows that electrocatalytic H2O2 reduction can 
take place at 0 V as reported in the literature (Ricci and Palleschi, 2005). To attain higher 
sensitivity, the glucose sensing potential as well as the potential for H2O2 electrocatalysis is set to 
-0.1 V here, unless otherwise mentioned. The FIA response to successive injections of 1 mM 
H2O2 is given in Fig. 2(b). The amperometric response to 1 mM H2O2 at pH 7.4 is highly 
reproducible (RSD = 2.54%) attributed to a thermally stabilized PB layer. The permeability of the 
outer PEDOT[GOD] layer to H2O2 allows a quick response. It takes ca. 10 sec to reach maximum 
FIA current and another 20 sec to recover 90% background. 
 
Figure 2. Electrocatalytic activity for H2O2 reduction in PBS, pH 7.4. (a) CV curves of the 
enzyme electrode in response to different H2O2 concentrations. (b) FIA response to 
successive injections of 1 mM H2O2. 
 
The performances of the flexible glucose sensor have been characterized with FIA, and the 
results are summarized in Fig. 3. In addition to quick and highly reproducible current responses, 
Fig. 3(a) shows highly resolved signals to glucose in the range between 0.1 and 30 mM. The FIA 
data suggests again that the enzyme electrode has a permeable outer PEDOT layer and a 
pH-stable inner PB layer. The calibration curve of the enzyme electrode is plotted in Fig. 3(b) 
from Fig. 3(a). It displays a wide dynamic range, and the most linear sensing range is between 0.1 
and 10 mM. When the concentration is higher than 10 mM, the sensitivity decreases as per the 
Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Nien et al., 2006). The sensitivity of the linear range is 2.1 
mA·mM-1·cm-2. This sensitivity is similar to that reported for FIA detection with a polymer/PB 
biosensor (Derwinska et al., 2003) but is still at the lower side as compared to the PB-based 
sensor fabricated on Pt or glassy carbon (GC) (Ricci and Palleschi, 2005). We consider the 
sensitivity can be improved by reducing the sheet resistance of SPCE/PET. A separate FIA 
experiment shows that the lower detection limit of the enzyme electrode is ca. 50 mM. 
(a) (b)
In comparison with pure glucose samples, Fig. 5 shows the chronoamperometric response of 
the enzyme electrode at -0.2 V recorded during the sequential addition of 100 ul reaction 
mixtures from enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis and the corresponding calibration curve. The 
experimental result verifies that such a novel sensor can be applied to monitor cellulose 
saccharification, which is a very crucial bioprocess to produce cellulosic ethanol fuel.
