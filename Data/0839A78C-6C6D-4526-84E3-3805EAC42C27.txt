2importance evaluation are two important
topics in customer relationship management
(CRM). In these fields, the RFM model is a
very famous approach. The R in RFM is the
recency of the latest purchase; F is the
purchasing frequency; and M is the total
monetary amount. The RFM model evaluates
a customer’s importance with the RFM total 
score, and classifies customers according to
the different buying power and magnitude of
each customer cluster. Traditional RFM
models include the models of Stone [3],
Miglautsch [2], Sung and Sang [4], etc. The
shortcomings of traditional RFM models are
(1) The way of dividing a dimension (R, F,
or M) into equal sections might not be
suitable for all products.
(2) Scoring with crisp numbers is too
subjective and inflexible.
(3) The exploration of the content of each
customer cluster provides little
information.
(4) It is difficult to differentiate customers
with the same RFM total scores.
To overcome these shortcomings, a
fuzzy set approach is proposed in this paper.
Firstly, the formula for calculating the R, F,
and M scores as well as that for calculating
the RFM total score are fuzzified, and a
customer’s importance is now evaluated with 
a more reasonable fuzzy value instead. A
fuzzy RFM total score not only preserves the
subjective and imprecise nature of a
customer’s “importance”, but also provides 
some information to assist the determination
of marketing targets. Secondly, a formula for
calculating the fuzzy weighted RFM total
score is also proposed to deal with the
situation in which R, F, and M are considered
unequally important. After screening out
unimportant customers with low fuzzy
(weighted) RFM total scores, the Fuzzy
C-means (FCM) approach is applied to
cluster important customers, so as to
establish different marketing strategies. In
this way, the number of customer clusters can
be arbitrarily specified, considering the
scarcity of marketing resources and the
diversification of marketing strategies. At last,
a demonstrative example is given, and the
advantages of the proposed methodology
over traditional RFM models are then
concluded.
2. The Fuzzy R, F, M scores and the
Fuzzy RFM Total Score
Calculating each customer’s RFM total 
score can help to find out the most important
customers to the enterprise as the targets of
marketing. However, a customer’s 
importance is a subjective and imprecise
concept, and it will be more appropriate if the
importance can be expressed with a fuzzy
value. The following procedure is proposed
to calculate the fuzzy RFM total score of a
customer:
(1) Apply simple fuzzy partition to divide
each dimension, and then assign a score
to each fuzzy interval: The data range
from the minimum to the maximum is
divided into fuzzy intervals with the
same widths.
(2) Calculate the membership that the
customer’s R, F, or M value belongs to
each fuzzy interval, so as to obtain the
customer’s fuzzy score, which can be 
expressed as {(score, membership)}.
(3) Add up the customer’s fuzzy R, F, and 
M scores according to Zadeh’s

by Xie & Beni [5] can be applied to
determine the optimal number of
clusters K.
5. A Demonstrative Example
A sample database of Microsoft Access
2000, the Northwind Traders database, is
adopted to demonstrate the application of the
proposed fuzzy set approach. There are 89
customers in this example. Firstly, the fuzzy
RFM total score of each customer is
calculated to evaluate the customer’s 
importance. The results are shown in Table 1.
The fuzzy RFM total score also allows of
some flexibility in determining the targets of
marketing. For example, if the marketing
resources are very sufficient, then even
customers whose memberships of high RFM
total scores are greater than 0 can be included.
Otherwise, customers whose memberships of
low RFM total scores are greater than 0
should be excluded. The fuzzy RFM total
score can also be defuzzified if necessary.
Table 1. Fuzzy RFM total scores.

Secondly, assume R, F, and M are
assigned diferent weights: R is “Moderate”, 
F is “Important”, and M is “Very Important”. 
Then the fuzzy weighted RFM total score of
each customer can be calculated to evaluate
the customer’s importance. The results are
summarized in Table 2. The top 3 most
important customers in Table 1 and Table 2
are the same. Besides, the spread of the fuzzy
weighted RFM total score is much wider than
that of the fuzzy RFM total score, which
indicates that more flexibility is gained by
assigning different weights.
