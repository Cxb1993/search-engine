Abstract 
Stern/propeller tunnels are able to 
increase planning hulls’ propulsion 
efficiency. However, the optimized shape 
and design method has not been completely 
developed due to the difficulty of measuring 
flow field in order to understand its 
influence to drag and pressure distribution, 
as well as propeller’s incoming flow. 
Therefore, the purposes of this research are 
(1) to develop a feasible, cheap, and 
easy-to-adjust moving optical velocimetry 
system for towing tank experiments, and (2) 
to investigate the flow fields near different 
kinds of stern/propeller tunnels on a 
planning boat. A planning hull with 
switchable stern part that has been tested for 
resistance will be used. The bottom will be 
modified to accommodate optical measuring 
instruments, PIV and LDV systems. A 
submerged fiver optic lens will be 
developed to replace a larger old duct for 
underwater optical access. If both PIV and 
LDV work well, test conditions include the 
baseline (original hull without tunnels), 
original designed tunnels with and without 
propeller action, and smoothed tunnels with 
and without propeller action. Meanwhile, 
CFD studies using commercial codes, 
Shipflow® and Star-CD®, will be 
conducted for the same conditions to 
evaluate their accuracy for this complex 
problem. 
 
Keywords: stern tunnel, PIV, LDV 
 
(二)研究計畫之背景及目的 
 
1. 背景與目的 
The motivation of this research is the 
need of a better understanding of how to 
design stern/propeller tunnels for high speed 
planning boats, and the improvement of 
optical measurement methods of flow field 
around a model in a towing tank by moving 
measuring instruments with models. 
Therefore, the purposes of this research are: 
(1) to develop a feasible, cheap, and 
easy-to-adjust moving optical velocimetry 
system for towing tank experiments, and (2) 
to investigate the flow field near 
stern/propeller tunnels on a planning boat. 
Both the motivation and purposes are 
described in detail as follows.  
Two major categories of marine vessels 
are displacement type and planning type. The 
former usually use Archimedes’ Principle for 
the payload and sail at lower speed, while the 
latter usually take the advantage of lift force 
acting on the bottom and sail at a high speed 
with a small bow-up trim, e.g. pleasure 
vessels, passenger vessels, and some military 
vessels etc. an important engineering goal in 
deigning a planning high speed vessel is to 
properly use dynamic forces to reduce 
required power. There are several features of 
high speed planning hull forms are associated 
with their resistance and propulsion issues. 
For example, a popular hull type of high 
speed planning craft has hard chine, and may 
have transverse steps at middle of wetted 
bottom.  
Generally, a planning hull form’s dead 
rise angle diminishes from bow towards stern.

2. 國內外有關本計畫之研究情況、重
要參考文獻之評述 
There are not many studies published 
about the effect of stern/propeller tunnels to 
date. Early studies about stern (or propeller) 
tunnels were reviewed recently by Anantha 
Subramanian and Subramanyam (2005). 
According to them, planning hull forms have 
been studied since 1960’s. But the tunnel 
problem was firstly studied in 1970’s. 
Harbugh and Blount (1973) did experiments 
of shallow and deep tunnels with propellers 
of various diameters and found that the 
combination of deep tunnel and large 
propeller provided best performance. Koelbel 
(1979) also studied the effect of tunnel on 
drag and propeller performance. More 
recently, Blount (1997) gave guidance of 
designing partial propeller tunnels and 
relative propeller placement to achieve high 
vessel performance. In addition to 
experiments and experience, CFD studies 
were carried out recently by Thorhill et al. 
(2003) and Anantha Subramanian and 
Subramanyam (2005), showing the drag and 
pressure distribution on the vessel.    
As to the velocity measuring techniques 
of a model in a towing tank, there have been 
only few researches in the past. Ink and/or 
wire attached on a model’s surface were used 
to observe the direction of the flow near the 
ship model first. Then, the necessary wake 
survey for propeller design was obtained 
using multiple Pitot tubes (or Pitot tube 
arrays), an intrusive measurement with low 
resolution. Multiple Pitot tubes are still 
widely used for the survey of flow around a 
ship model today (Kim et al., 2001). Later, 
Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), a 
non-intrusive optical method, was introduced 
in the measuring of propeller flow field. Past 
particle image velocimetry (PIV) as another 
non-intrusive optical measurement technique 
has become a mature flow velocity 
measuring method in the last two decades. 
Its theoretical foundation and basic 
techniques were described by some early 
researches (Adrain, 1991; Willert and Gharib, 
1991; Westerweel, 1997). It has several 
performance levels invented in the last 
decade (Raffel et al., 1998): 2-D (planar 
measurement), 3-D (volumetric 
measurement), 2-C (two components of 
velocity measurement), and 3-C (three 
components of velocity measurement). 
Among them, 3-C and/or 3-D PIV require 
complicate instrument setup and/or data 
process. The mature 2-D plus 2-C PIV which 
measure two components of velocity in a 
plane is the simplest one, but it is powerful 
enough to provide necessary data for ship 
flow field survey. 
Few studies used PIV to measure ship 
model’s flow field, either by a fixed PIV 
system or by a moving PIV system. A fixed 
PIV system is similar to other PIV system 
commonly used in wind/ water tunnels. For 
example, Ding et al. (1997) used a PIV 
system fixed on the ground to measure the 
bow wave profiles and the flow field under 
waves of a ship model. Roth et al. (1999) 
used similar method to study bow wave’s 
flow structure. Scarano et al. (2002) studied a 
submerged airplane model’s vortex structure 
using double pulse laser above water surface 
with a Plexiglass window across air–water 
surface and a camera in an underwater 
container on a sidewall of the tank. Paik et al. 
(2004) used a fixed PIV system in an open 
water channel to study a ship model’s wake 
and flow field due to propeller action. 
Although the study by Paik et al. successfully 
used PIV to study a ship model’s wake, their 
study was still a fixed PIV system in a 
relatively smaller test facility. This implies 
that a ship model’s complete characteristics 
could only be known either by a 
resistance/motion test in a towing tank using 
a larger scaled model plus a flow field test in 
an open channel using a smaller model, or by 
doing all tests using the same smaller model 
in an open channel with larger uncertainty of 
the important resistance–velocity relationship 
due to scale effect. 
Experiments using a submerged moving 
PIV system in a towing tank have rarely been 
reported. In addition to very expensive 
commercial products by Dantec Inc. 
(successfully used in University of Iowa’s 
velocities in three directions on 
transverse and longitudinal planes at 
different longitudinal locations along the 
stern/propeller tunnels. The initial 
condition of the ship model will have a 
draft at design water line with even keel 
and two different trim angles for all test 
conditions. Different shapes of 
stern/propeller tunnels and propeller 
acting conditions will be tested as 
follows:  
 
‐ 5 ‐ 
(1) Baseline: the original shape without 
stern/propeller tunnel.  
(2) Bare hull with original 
stern/propeller tunnels: switching 
the stern part to that with original 
designed stern/propeller tunnels. 
(3) Bare hull with smooth 
stern/propeller tunnels: the 
stern/propeller tunnels have smooth 
edge. The purposes are: (i) a better 
optical measuring environment 
because the sharp edge may cause 
unexpected deflection blinding 
measuring space at some conditions, 
and (ii) a probable different flow 
filed for propeller inflow and 
pressure distribution at the bottom. 
Whether it will be better for both 
will be understood after 
experiments.  
(4) Hull with stern/propeller tunnels and 
propeller acting: If the above test 
conditions can be finished in time, 
we will do this condition. If not, this 
will be carried out in the future.  
2. Modifying ship model: We will use the 
model of the planning boat (a 70ft sport 
fisherman yacht, Fig.3) tested in 2008 at 
NCKU as the baseline of the whole 
research since its performance has been 
measured, except the flow field and 
pressure distribution, and we already 
have the model such that partial model 
making fee can be saved. The original 
model was made by wood. To make the 
bottom as a possible optical access path 
from inside the model, we need to modify 
the bottom of the stern part to be 
transparent. Plexiglass, acrylic, and glass 
are considered as possible material. After 
discussing with technicians, we will try 
the best material for making these 
transparent parts. 
 
 
Fig.3 The models of a 70ft sport 
fisherman boat to be used for this research. 
The stern part of the model is switchable. 
 
Moreover, due to the curvy tunnel section, 
light beams deflect and may start to focus or 
diverge if the indices of reflection are 
different on both sides of the tunnel. A 
reasonable solution to this problem is to 
match the indices of reflection on both sides, 
similar to what Uzol et al. (2002) did. It must 
be water outside the tunnel. So, fortunately, 
we only need to fill in water inside the tunnel 
to avoid deflection problem, instead of using 
any special solution. To make reasonable 
setup, it is planned to modify the stern part to 
have a flat horizontal transparent bulkhead to 
form a compartment filled with water right 
above the stern/propeller tunnels, as seen in 
Fig. 4. The light beams thus pass through 
different media through a parallel media to 
avoid focusing or diverging phenomenon. 
Hence, a laser sheet or laser beams can keep 
their original feature.  
The propellers and its motor, if we 
proceed to that test condition, will be 
installed. The motor will be installed on top 
of new stern compartment and connect with 
the propeller through a set of gears to change 
driven direction, because we don’t want the 
shaft passing through the stern part into the 
front part of the model generating complicate 
setup problems. This may also generates a 
small problem for the optical system. But 
motor can always be installed in a higher 
ends can fit the current apparatus. Therefore, 
it is considered as the second method. If no 
commercial adapt ring can fit, we may need 
to customize it with a higher price and 
longer time.

Fig. 5 Optical paths for mini-LDV: Top view (left) and side views for measuring three 
components of velocities at different location along the stern/propeller tunnel. 
 
For min-LDV whose focusing distance 
is 24cm, we will try to use it from inside the 
ship model. So, a rotatable base with a 
simple orthogonal rail system and a holder to 
fix the LDV probe will be designed and 
install in the stern part using current optical 
parts in our labs. Hence, the LDV probe can 
travel along longitudinal and transverse 
directions to measure at different locations, 
and also measure velocities in transverse and 
longitudinal directions. The velocity in the 
vertical direction to the hull is not 
measurable in this setup. Fortunately, the 
only place where the vertical velocity is 
significant and important is near the tunnel 
entrance because the flow is nearly parallel 
to the hull inside the tunnel.  
Therefore, to measure the vertical velocity 
near the tunnel entrance, a vertical and 
reflecting mirror will be installed in the 
compartment of the stern part and in front of 
the stern/propeller tunnel, such that when the 
LDV probe is installed near horizontally but 
with a small vertically inclined angle, its 
optical path will be nearly parallel to the 
stern/propeller tunnel and below the hull. If 
the focusing distance is too short, we will 
add a concave lens in front of the LDV probe 
to elongate it measuring distance. The 
vertical velocity component can be 
decomposed from measured velocity using 
simple geometrical analysis given that the 
angle of the laser beam’s optical path is 
measured accurately. Hence, all three 
components of velocities at different 
locations along the stern/propeller tunnel are 
measurable. All the accurate focusing point 
of laser beams will be calculated carefully 
considering the small change due to their 
passing through transparent bulkhead and 
hull. The optical set up for LDV is 
summarized in Fig. 5.  
 
4. Improvement of seeding system: We used 
a simple home-made seeding system in 
moving PIV system as described in Chen 
and Chang (2006). The seeding particles 
are titanium dioxide (TiO2) which is

and extended studies (in preparation)

to conquer this problem: an FFT filtering 
process to eliminate such kind of relative low 
frequency movement before PIV algorithm. 
Similarly, LDV’s signals can be processed 
using typical filtering technique as used in 
resistance measurement. We will also 
measure the vibration characteristics of the 
carriage before all test.

The image results obtained from the camera 
is upside down due to mirror as shown in 
Fig.21 for streamwise measurement. The left 
picture is resulted from the reflecting mirror 
and different camera direction with the hull 
orientation. Accordingly, it is required to 
modify the image direction using the image 
software without changing the magnitude and 
the image shape as shown in the right picture 
of the Fig.21. 
Similar to the streamwise measurement, the 
cross streamwise measurement generates the 
image result with upside down direction as 
shown in Fig.22 left picture. 
Accordingly, it is required to apply the post 
processing correcting the image direction 
after both the image recording and/or PIV 
analyzing image data and it shown in Fig.22 
in right picture.

The PIV measurement yields 200 pair 
images in average for each position 
measurements. The raw image analysis is 
conducted to obtain required image result 
quality before analyzing. The images amount 
that qualify for analyzing varies for different 
position measurements. However, the 
average of qualify image results amount is 75 
image pairs. The highest average image pairs 
are the streamwise plane with the 100 image

Fig.24 PIV analyzing process, raw image (left), after PIV analyzing (center) 
and after PIV analyzing with vector validation (right) 
 
The validation scheme is then applied 
for the whole PIV measurement and analysis 
with the absolute value of range vector which 
will vary for each measurement planes. The 
global filter standard deviation is used for the 
next validation step since it will apply the 
vector field global mean and standard 
deviation values to remove the outlying 
vectors. The smooth parameter of validation 
vector with the small range 3 x 3 of 
neighboring vectors and Gaussian radius is 
applied of the last validation scheme steps. 
Following to the vector result from the raw 
image result shown in figure 3.3 in left and 
center images, the vector image result after 
pass and validation scheme is yield as in 
Fig.23 in right image. 
 
Streamwise Measurement 
The Streamwise measurements are 
conducted with three different positions as 
discussed in section 2.2.5.2 at towing speed 
of 0.69 m/s. The data result then analyzed by 
PIV analyzing software to obtain both 
instantaneous and mean velocity of flow 
fields. Each flow field is provided by the 
velocity profile result that could be generated 
from the instantaneous and average flow field. 
The non-dimensional longitudinal velocity 
component is then obtained from the 
instantaneous and average flow field as it 
shown on Fig.25 for longitudinal velocity 
profile for Buttock Line 4.3 cm (Bl. 4.3 cm of 
center line) at three locations of propeller 
plane, 50 mm and mid cross section of stern 
tunnel (85 mm in front of propeller plane).All 
of the results presented in the following are 
non-dimensional where the distance is 
divided by the diameter of stern tunnel at 80 
mm and the velocity result divided by the 
towing carriers speed at 0.69 m/s. 
The vertical axis represents the vertical 
distance (z*) within the measurement 
window for PIV measurement. This local 
coordinate systems origin is on the stern 
tunnel wall. The horizontal axis represents 
the non-dimensional distance yielded from 
dividing longitudinal velocity by the towing 
speed (Ux/U). The inserted picture in each 
figure represents the location of 
measurement. 
Fig.25 shows evidence that the presence 
of stern tunnel generate the inflow 
longitudinal velocity in nearly constant 
particularly around the propeller region for 
all positions from the mid cross section of the 
tunnel, 50 mm in front of propeller plane and 
at propeller plane. 
In averaging, it could be analyzed that 
the longitudinal velocity for three 
longitudinal locations is nearly constant 
within the propeller plane particularly below 
the boundary region below 0.2. Among three 
positions of mid cross section of tunnel, 50 
mm in front of propeller plane and on 
propeller plane, there is a gradual increase of 
longitudinal velocity that might be caused by 
the entrance shape of stern tunnel. However, 
the homogeneously of the flow pattern and 
the magnitude of longitudinal velocity inside 
the stern tunnel region particularly at 
propeller region, give the conformity to the 
conclusion of wake measurement around the 
stern tunnel of container ship conducted by 
‐ 21 ‐ 
CFD simulation where Shih conducted the 
LDV measurement. 
 
 
 
Fig.28 Velocity comparison results of PIV measurement and CFD simulation for Bl. 4.3 cm 
(Non-dimensional by free stream velocity and stern tunnel tip distance)  
 
Fig.28 shows the comparison 
longitudinal velocity result for both 
measurement PIV and CFD simulation within 
the Bl. 4.3 cm at two positions of mid section 
of stern tunnel and at propeller plane. The 
figure detected that there is a much different 
boundary thickness between PIV and CFD 
simulation result. PIV measurement could not 
provide the boundary profile below the stern 
tunnel wall for mid section of stern tunnel, 
while CFD simulated the boundary thickness 
about 40 mm below the stern tunnel wall for 
both positions. However, PIV could not 
identify the boundary profile since there is no 
data obtained near the stern tunnel wall. This 
is caused by the reflection of laser light near 
the stern tunnel wall and will discuss detail in 
section 3.5. 
The highest error within the boundary 
thickness region is 14.2 % at value 0.2 below 
the wall of stern tunnel. The boundary region 
near the stern tunnel is within the curvy stern 
tunnel shape of transparent that might cause 
an error and spurious vectors of PIV result 
that will be explained detail in section 3.5. 
The region under the wall of stern tunnel 
also have different result even the trend line 
is similar between PIV and CFD simulation. 
The straight line of each result is yielded 
from both measurements. However, the 
difference between PIV measurements and 
CFD simulation is 4.9 % in average.

The cross streamwise measurement also 
conducted with Star CCM+ CFD simulation 
Fig.31 clearly detected the inflow from 
both side centerline and the outside of the 
cross stern tunnel. The inflow velocity value 
from the outside of stern tunnel is higher than 
software using the identical model and 
measurement condition. The comparison of 
both PIV result and CFD result are compared 
in the Fig.33 for the cross streamwise 
measurement at mid section of tunnel and 
Fig.34 at propeller plane. 
the centerline. Further to the cross section 
plane, the general inflow from the bottom 
region of the tunnel coming upward to the 
tunnels wall. The inflow structure shown in 
Fig.31 due to the present of the stern tunnel 
where there is a low pressure inside the stern 
tunnel and the phenomena could increase the 
stability of the inflow into the propeller 
region.  
Fig.33 shows the similar flow pattern 
where two inflow from outside coming into 
the stern tunnel region particularly from each 
tip edge of the stern tunnel. The vorticity 
pattern of PIV measurement is nearly 
identical with CFD simulation. However, 
there is a vortex occurred upper side tip edge 
of stern tunnel near the center line of the 
model for PIV measurement. 
Similar flow pattern occur for the 
measurement at Propeller plane shown in 
Fig.32. The structure inflow among the cross 
plane of the stern tunnel is nearly constant 
with the inflow in the middle of the stern 
tunnel. Accordingly, the presence of stern 
tunnel could generate nearly constant and 
homogeneous inflow within the propeller 
region that could decrease the defect inflow 
to increase the performance of hull-propeller 
interaction. 
 
 
 
‐ 25 ‐ 
cross plane have the higher value than both 
sides at left and right sides even the values 
are less than 2% different. This is due to the 
presence of the edge shape of stern tunnel 
compare with the value in the mid section 
inside the stern tunnel. This could confirm 
the experiments results conducted by Crook  
as discussed in section 3.2. 
‐ 27 ‐ 
The longitudinal velocities alongside the 
propeller plane and mid cross section stern 
tunnel are higher values than the region 
alongside near centerline. This is due to the 
outside region is near the free stream velocity 
rather than the region near centerline that 
influence by the friction and viscous of keel. 
Comparing the longitudinal mean velocity (U) 
vertically for each vertical line shows that the 
values among three position near wall of 
stern tunnel, at the circle center of propeller 
plane and bottom of propeller plane have 
slightly different about below 1 %. The 
velocity value at bottom region have slightly 
higher values than near the wall of stern 
tunnel. This is due to the viscous effect of the 
wall stern tunnel. 
However, it also found that the velocity 
at mid section of cross plane is higher than 
both sides comparing the velocity at near the 
wall of stern tunnel. This confirm the 
experiment and simulation results conducted 
by Kulczyk and Zajac that the different 
height of the stern tunnel will also influence 
the performance of stern tunnel form hull to 
the propeller performance. 
 
Experiments Discussion 
The recent PIV measurements have been 
conducted using the moving system where 
the PIV system is following the model 
moving. The system applied the modification 
of ship model and hydrofoil duct that provide 
the accessible image and laser light paths to 
analyze the flow field around stern tunnel. 
However, this modification system 
generates some issues for the experiment 
results that already discussed in section 3.2 
and 3.3. The issue yield the spurious vector 
results particularly at the region near the wall 
of stern tunnel. Further to the region near the 
wall of stern tunnel, there is a image blur of 
the image results that generated by the laser 
light reflection at the curvy shape of the stern 
tunnel. This reflection blocked the boundary 
region near the wall of stern tunnel resulting 
to the no vectors at near the wall as discussed 
in section 3.2 and 3.3. Fig.36 shows the 
reflection blocking image resulted by cross 
streamwise measurement plane that identified 
by the red area due to the over exposed of 
camera recording due to the high level of 
brightness resulting from laser light 
reflection.

2.對於學術研究、國家發展及其他應用方面
之貢獻 
This research can improve our 
capability and experience in towing tank 
experiments. Therefore, it might bring some 
visibility internationally and help Taiwan’s 
academic exchange with other countries. This 
might be very important considering that 
Taiwan is unable to join International Towing 
Tank Conference. It can also improve our 
understanding of stern/propeller tunnel, 
especially the mechanism in drag and 
propeller inflow aspects, and contribute to a 
more complete guidance of optimization 
design methods for stern/propeller tunnels on 
planning hulls. Hence, it may be applied to 
the development of such kinds of ships and 
boats in the future and help Taiwan’s 
shipbuilding industry.
