Abstract
This study investigates the temperature and thermal dose of a tumor in hyperthermia therapy with
non-local equilibrium. The thermal model assumes the tissue with blood vessel distribution as a porous media
and uses the convection terms instead of perfusion terms in energy conservation equations for both tissue and
blood. By using numerical method, this study calculates the temperature and thermal dose response of tissue
for different vessel diameters and blood velocities with keeping constant porosity. Through the accuracy and
model comparison, the results show that the temperature responses of tissue for different cases by this
numerical method are reliable, and the model is suitable for various vessel diameters and porosity.
Keywords: Tumor, Hyperthermia, Non-Local Equilibration, Temperature, Thermal Dose
1 Introduction
Hyperthermia therapy is a method to destroy or
control the tumor. Since Pennes [1] proposes a
simple bioheat equation model with a perfusion term,
many literatures discuss the validation of perfusion
term, and the simplicity of one equation in Pennes
model. Arkin, et al. [2] reviews many new bioheat
transfer models by researchers from 1948 to 1994.
The comment of Arkin, et al. is that the new models
still lack experimental grounding, and Pennes model
may still be the best practical approach for modeling
bioheat transfer because of its simplicity. In fact,
the one-equation bioheat transfer model is basing on
the assumption of local thermal equilibration, which
is the temperature of tissue is equal to the
temperature of blood. Because local thermal
equilibration occurs when heat exchange ability
between tissue and blood is good, it is valid in the
capillary bed having large density of vessels and area
of heat transfer. According to the literature of
Weinbaum [3][4], the largest local temperature
difference between the blood and tissue is the order
of 0.2 C when the tissue has only metabolic heat
generation, and this occurs in large vessels of
100-300μm diameters. Therefore, most models of
one equation are suitable to the case of d<300μm on
the Table 1 of literature by Arkin, et al. [2].
On the other hand, due to the simple concept of
porous media, many authors investigate the heat
transfer in biological tissue by using theory of porous
media. Khaled and Vafai [5] make a review about
the role of porous media in modeling flow and heat
transfer in biological tissues. The literature
concludes that the developing advanced heat transfer
models based on thermal non-equilibrium states
between the blood and tissue is an important task.
Xuan and Roetzel [6] use the porous media concept
to analyze the steady temperature fields of tissue,
artery and vein by a system of three energy equations.
Although the governing equations are three
dimensional, authors simplify them into a
two-dimensional equation for tissue and two
one-dimensional equations for bloods based on
analyzing an arm. The literature calculates the
steady temperatures of tissue and bloods by
numerical method. Later, Roetzel and Xuan [7]
extend to investigate the transient heat transfer

Arkin et al. [2], as well as the distance between
capillaries is larger than 140m in brain based on the
paper of Kocher et al. [10]. Therefore, this study
selects the vessel diameter and distance of vessels is
15m and 140m to estimate the porosity and
volumetric transfer area from Eqs. (1) and (2).
Based on the estimating porosity of 0.01, this study
selects the range of porosity to be 0.005<<0.05 to
investigate the temperature response of tissue in
hyperthermia therapy. In this study, author keeps
the porosity as a constant and calculates different
volumetric transfer area for various diameters of
blood vessels. Table 1 lists the relationship of
volumetric heat transfer area and diameters of blood
vessel. Meanwhile, the velocity of blood is 0.1, 3, 6,
and 8cm/s for the diameter of blood vessel of 10, 100,
500, and 1000μm, respectively. The velocity data
cite from the literature [11-13], and they are relating
to the blood vessel of capillaries, terminal braches,
secondary branches, and main branches of a 13-kg
dog [11].
This study uses both finite difference method
and a software package, FlexPDE, to simulate the
transient temperature field of tissue and blood. This
study discretizes the differential equations of (3) and
(4) into finite difference equations by a uniform grid
generation, as well as uses the implicit method to
treat the unknown variables. In addition, the
Fortran code uses the ADI method to solve the
tridigonal matrix. On the other hand, because
FlexPDE is a flexible solver for partial differential
equations, this study utilizes FlexPDE software
directly to solve the governing equations of (3) and
(4). Table 2 is a relative error of tissue temperature
at center point for different grid dimension to that
with grid dimension 101101101 in this numerical
method when the u=2mm/s, q=10106, τ=10s, and
a =167m2/m3. According to the results of Table 2,
this study selects the dimension of grid to be
616161 because of the relative error lower than
0.5%. Figure 2 is the accuracy comparison between
this numerical method and previous literature [8] for
one-equation model when the heating duration is
10sec, heating power density is 107 W/m3, porosity is
0.05, and blood velocity is 2 mm/s. In the
comparison case, this study combines the equations
of (3) and (4) into one-equation by assuming local
equilibration, which is identical to the governing
equation of literature [8]. In this figure, it is
obvious that the results calculated by Fortran
program coincide with the results of analytical
solution by Kou, et al. Therefore, this numerical
method is reliable. In order to make sure the
accuracy of this numerical method for solving
two-equation model, this study compares the results
calculated by this numerical program with the results
calculated by FlexPDE software in Fig. 3. Figure 3
compares the results of this study and numerical
package for two-equation model with different
volumetric transfer area when the heating duration is
10sec, heating power density is 107 W/m3, porosity is
0.05, and blood velocity is 2mm/s. It shows that the
symbols are similar to the line in this figure, so the
numerical method for solving two-equation model is
also accurate.
4. Results and Discussion
Figure 4(a) depicts the tissue temperature at
center point of heating zone versus time for different
volumetric transfer area and blood velocity at ε
=0.005 and h=173W/m2 ℃ . Meanwhile, the
continuous, dashed, dash-dotted, and
dash-doubledotted line represents the volumetric
transfer area of 2000, 200, 40, and 20 m2/m3 as well
as the blood velocity of 0.1, 3, 6, and 8cm/s. The
symbol of square is the result of Pennes model when
the perfusion rate is 6.56kg/m3s. Based on the
research of Payne, et al. [9], the heat transfer
mechanism with wb=6.56 is same to that with
h=173W/m2℃. In addition, the symbol of delta is
the result of Kou’s one-equation model [8], which is
in porous media with local thermal equilibrium. In
this figure, the symbol of delta coincide with the
continuous line, which is u=0.1cm/s and a =2000
m2/m3 (d=10μm, =125μm). This is reasonable
that the local thermal equilibrium is valid in porous
media when both the diameter of blood vessel and the
distance between blood vessels are small. In other
words, the Kou’s model is valid for the immense
distribution of microvasculars, i.e. the capillary bed.
In this figure, the symbol of square sounds like
matching the dashed line, which is the u=3cm/s and
a =200 m2/m3 (d=100μm, =1253μm). This
result indicate that the Pennes model is not valid for
capillary, but for the tissue with larger vessels
distribution. This is agreeable with the statement by
Charny and Levin [14], “The perfusion term
describes heat loss due to breed-off from the largest
branching vessels and not capillary heat exchange at
the terminal end of the microvascular network”. In
Fig. 4(a), the temperature response of tissue does not
regularly decrease with the increase of blood velocity
when the porosity is constant. Because the effect
factors for tissue temperature include the blood
velocity and volumetric transfer area when we keep

isotherm of Pennes model is symmetrical to the
center point for all time. This means the blood
velocity does not affect the temperature distribution,
because blood velocity does not exist in Pennes
model. On the contrary, the isotherm of this study’s
model and Kou’s model slightly move toward the
down stream of blood flow, because the blood
velocity is only 0.1cm/s. In addition, the isotherm
of continuous line includes larger area than the
isotherm of dashed line does when the time are 25
and 50 seconds, but the isotherm of continuous line
includes smaller area than the isotherm of dashed line
does when the time are 100 and 150 seconds. This
means that the temperature rise predicted by this
study is quicker than that by Pennes model in the
heating period, but the temperature drop predicted by
this study is slower than that predicted by Pennes
model after heating. The result indicates that the
perfusion term in Pennes model is overcooling the
tissue when the tissue is capillary bed.
Figure 8 is the contour plot of tissue
temperature on the x-y plane of z=1cm at 25, 50, 100,
and 150 seconds when the porosity is 0.005, the
blood velocity is 3cm/s, and the volumetric transfer
area is 200 m2/m3. In this figure, it is obvious to
observe the effect of blood velocity on the
temperature distribution. Because Pennes model
has not the velocity term, the dashed line is still
symmetrical to the center of x-y plane. If we focus
on the isotherm of continuous line and dash-dotted
line, we find that the isotherm of Kou’s model move
along the blood flow direction more than that of this
study. Because the case is not suitable for the local
thermal equilibrium due to the obvious temperature
difference between tissue and blood in Figs. 4(a) and
4(b), the Kou’s model is not valid here. If we check
Kou’s model, its velocity term sounds like the heat
carried away by the “tissue flow”. When the local
thermal equilibrium is valid, the tissue temperature is
equal to the blood temperature. Therefore, the
result calculated by Kou’s model is same to the result
of this study, and both of them show the effect of
blood. However, the heat carried away by “tissue
flow”must be larger than that carried away by blood
flow when the blood temperature is obviously lower
than tissue temperature under non-local thermal
equilibrium. In addition, although the tissue
temperature at center point by Pennes model is same
to that by this study in the case of u=3cm/s and
a =200 m2/m3 in Fig. 4(a), the temperature
distribution at other region is obviously different
between Pennes model and this study. Therefore,
Pennes model cannot accurately predict the
temperature domain with considering blood flowing
in hyperthermia therapy.
5 Conclusions
This study investigates the temperature and
thermal dose of a tissue with blood vessel distribution
in hyperthermia therapy. Assuming the vessels be
straight and uniform distribution, this study
formulates the energy equations of tissue and blood
with porous media concept. Furthermore, this study
uses the convection term instead of perfusion term
used in most models before. By using the numerical
method, this study calculates the temperature field
and thermal dose field versus time for different
conditions. Through the accuracy comparison with
previous literature and commercial package, this
numerical method is reliable. In addition, this study
simultaneously shows the results calculated by this
study model, Pennes model, and Kou’s model.
According to the results, this study concludes that
Kou’s model is suitable for small blood vessel and
low porosity, which satisfies the local equilibration
assumption. Pennes model is suitable for tissues
with large blood distribution and low blood velocity,
because the isotherm of temperature is symmetrical
to the heating center due to the lack of velocity in the
model. Comparing the three models indicates that
the two-equation model of this study can predict the
temperature and thermal dose in hyperthermia
therapy for wider conditions of tissue and blood.

國際會議心得報告
本人將計畫之初步結果投稿至 The 16th International Symposium on Transport
Phenomena ISTP-16 國際會議，並於該會議上作口頭報告。該會議於捷克布拉格的布拉
格科技大學舉行，議程由 2005 年 8 月 29 日至 9月 1日。報名參加該會議的本國熱流先
進約近 20 人，分別是曾培元、牛仰堯、潘大知、蔡永利、林顯群、楊瑞珍、林 呈、
李福星、侯順雄、鄭仁杰、沈銘秋、宋齊有等教授。
在會議中除了本身的口頭報告外，亦參與張貼論文的討論。其中本人較有興趣的為
蔡永利教授與鄭仁杰教授的研究，”Enhancement of heat transfer from block heat
sources mounted on a board to air stream in a channel by constructing slots in
the board”。此篇論文主要是探討利用基板上之狹縫對整體基板與發熱塊之散熱性能
之增強效果，該論文使用 Fortran 語言所撰寫的程式分析此一系統之流場、溫度場與對
流係數。分析結果顯示此狹縫之開設對系統之平均 Nusselt 數可提升到 64%，此狹縫位
置之改變對對流係數之影響會隨著基板與流道間隙減少而增加其相對敏感度。
此次參與國際會議並作口頭發表，除對自己以英文表達研究成果的技巧更加精進
外，亦同時與國內、外同領域的先進達到研究交流與切磋的功效。在未來的研究上，除
了專業上的突破亦期許自我英文能力聽說讀寫的進步，以達國際化的研究水準。
