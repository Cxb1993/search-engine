involving the structure of Riccati matrix 
inequality, but it needs to impose the addition 
restriction that the time-delay is invariant for 
making the result of feasible. Significantly, the 
LMI approach is involved for analyzing in [11], 
the efficiency and superiority are described 
therein. In [11], the proposed criteria involved 
an extra parameter, and an LMI-based 
algorithm is then established to numerically 
verify and obtain the robust stability bound. 
In this project, we first address the stability 
of linear uncertain systems with time 
varying-delay and propose a sufficient 
condition for the unforced systems. The 
derived criteria can be directly reformulated in 
LMIs, so we can readily numerically verify by 
current LMI solver [12]. By involving a state 
feedback controller, the result is extended to 
deal with the stabilization problem, and a 
stabilizing controller can be achieved by the 
obtained feasible solutions from LMI solver. 
Furthermore, we discuss the stability and 
stabilization of the systems with multiple 
time-varying delays.  
 
 
2   Problem Formulation 
 
Consider the linear uncertain system with 
time-varying delay state described by

0>t  
)()( ssx Ψ= , 0≤≤− sh                (1) 
 
where nx ℜ∈⋅)(  is the state vector, mu ℜ∈⋅)(  
is the control input. The time-delay )(th  is 
any time-varying bounded continuous 
nonnegative function satisfying 1)( <th& , i.e., 
there are some constants h  and δ  such that 
hth ≤≤ )(0  and 1)( <≤ δth& . The initial term 
)(sΨ , ]0,[ hs −∈ , is a continuous vector 
function. A, dA  and B represent the constant 
matrices with appropriate dimensions and A∆ , 
dA∆  and B∆  denote linearly dependent 
interval matrices of the forms

3 Stability Analysis and Stabilization 
 
For analyzing the stability and stabilization 
of the system in (2), we need the following 
result in advance. 
 
Lemma 3.1: For matrix function 
ESAAAf T −=)(  with nnEA ×ℜ∈,  and 
0≥S , if there exists two nn×  matrices 1A  
and 2A  satisfying 0)( 1 <Af  and 0)( 2 <Af , 
then 0)( 2211 <+ AAf αα , where 
1,0 21 ≤≤ αα  and 121 =+αα . 
 
A sufficient condition of the unforced 
system in (2), i.e., 0)( ≡tu  in (2), is presented 
as follows.

is robustly stable, if there exists positive

given delay h(t)  is time-variant, the previous 
work in [10] cannot be applied in this case. By 
the result in [11], we can obtain the robust 
stability bound 058.0=*η  from the proposed 
LMI-based algorithm, and the stability of the 
considered system with 3295.0~ ≤dA  cannot 
be guaranteed. By the fact 75.0)( =≤ δth&  
and Theorem 3.1, from the LMI solver we 
obtain the feasible solutions
