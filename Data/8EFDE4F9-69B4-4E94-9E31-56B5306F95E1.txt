robustness and key existence. Moreover, watermarking systems can be classified as visible and 
invisible. Visible watermarks are designed to be easily perceived by the viewer, and to identify 
the owner clearly (e.g. cable TV). Hence, most current researches focus on invisible watermarks, 
which are imperceptible under normal viewing conditions. The embedded domain for the mark 
of image can be broadly classified into two categories: (I) spatial domain methods [1-2], which 
embed data by directly modifying the pixel values of the original image, and (II) transform 
domain methods, which embed the data by modulating the coefficients of an appropriately 
selected transform domain such as DCT [3-5], DFT [5-6], and DWT [7-10] etc.. Invisible 
watermarking is suitable to be utilized as an IPR protection mechanism for most digital content. 
In the history, C.T. Hsu et al. [3] presented a visually recognizable pattern using the block 
DCT-based algorithm. The mark information was embedded into the mid-frequency parts of the 
image. X. Kang et al. [5] embedded the mark using the two transform domain (i.e. DWT and 
DFT), where the performance for the watermarked image is complex determined by an 
appropriate complex calculation. 
X.G Xia et al. [8] proposed a multiresolution watermarking system that inserts 
pseudo-random codes in the large coefficients at the high and middle frequency bands of the 
DWT of an image. Their watermarking method is robust to some common image compression 
and halftoning techniques, but the watermark detection is dependent on the noise level in an 
image. Tsai et al. [10] developed a watermarking scheme that adopts the wavelet domain image 
frequency components and the chaotic transformation to choose the location when embedding 
the watermark. 
This investigation still concentrates on invisible watermarking technology, but embeds the 
watermark in the transform domain of image by the cellular automata transform (CAT) [12] 
method. The CAT method can no need float-point processor so it is easier to implement than the 
DCT, DFT, or DWT. The inverse CAT produces a reconstructive image that is identical to the 
original. It has perfect-reconstruction technique better than other transform to prevent distortion. 
 
2. CAT 
1-D cellular spaces provide the simplest environment for creating CAT bases, and can be 
formed using several systems for 1-D cellular spaces. A basic type definition is as follows: 
12 −= kiikik xxX , 1,0 −≤≤ rki ,           (1) 
where r represents the total number of initial CA cells, and }1 ,0{x ∈ik  represents the state of 
the CAs at the node i at time kt = . 2-D CAs base can be obtained from 1-D penetrate canonical 
product as follows: 
jlikikjl XXX = , 1,0 −≤≤ rljk,i, .           (2) 
After generating the 2-D CAs, the CAT and inverse CAT (ICAT) performed on image processing 
can be calculated using Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.

4. Watermarked Image Extracting Method 
The extracting process, can easily extract the watermark from the watermarked image 
without original testing image and mark and as steps as embedded algorithm. First, the 
watermarked image we also decomposed for F-level CAT using the same pre-define initial 
configuration and rule number, thus obtaining the LH ′  and HL ′  sub-bands. Furthermore, the 
values of LH ′  and HL ′  can be extracted and compared using the following equation:

5. Experimental Results 
The experiments adopted the “Lena” and “Jet” testing images, which were 256-gray-level 
images of size 512512× , and are illustrated in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. Fig. 3(c) shows 
the 3232×  testing binary mark.

The robustness of the proposed watermarking strategy was then tested. For brevity, only 
201011000  and 47 for initial configuration and rule number were considered. Subsequently, let 
131 =r , 152 =r  for Lena and 131 =r , 132 =r  for Jet. Table III shows the details of the attacks 
used and the corresponding results. Fig. 5 (a) and (b) illustrate the watermarked images for JPEG 
compression with PSNRs  of 41.974 and 40.788 dB, respectively. Table IV shows the 
performance comparison with CAT and DWT in PSNRs  and BERs , respectively. We can see 
that the proposed method in the comparison, the results show that the proposed approaches are 
useful while a substantial gain is achieved by the proposed CAT.
