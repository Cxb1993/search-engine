PROPOSED SOFT INFORMATION ASSISTED
SCHEME:
In the section, we ﬁrst review the symbol based MMSE
detector in [9] and then propose a two-stage MMSE MUD.
And for the consideration of low complexity, a multistage
MMSE group MUD will also be presented.
A. Symbol Based MMSE Detector
Based on MMSE decision rule, Tran. et al. [9] proposed a
symbol based MMSE detector, which can be easily extended
to multiuser systems. Using eq. (1), the symbol based MMSE
detector can be given by
Wsym = arg min
W
E
[∣∣∣b−WHr|2∣∣∣]
= HH(HHH + σ2I2MR)
−1 (2)
where IM is the M ×M identity matrix. The ﬁnal estimation
of b is sgn(WHsymr) where sgn(·) is the sigmoid function.
B. Proposed Two-Stage MMSE Scheme
To enhance the performance of the symbol based MMSE de-
tector, in this subsection we consider a new two-stage MMSE
scheme, which uses the symbol based MMSE detector as the
ﬁrst stage and a bank of MMSE group MUDs is considered as
the second stage. Due to reasons that transmission signaling
2
K2=1, and K3=1, for the multi-stage MMSE group MUD, as
shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the BER performance of
proposed multi-stage MMSE group MUD can reach almost the
same as that of the symbol based MMSE MUD in 5 stages.
Since simulations with different user conﬁgurations achieved
similar results, therefore, the number of stages for the multi-
stage MMSE group MUD were chosen as 5 in the following
simulations.
Next, we compared the BER performance versus the SNR
for two separate scenarios, K1 = 1, K2 = 1, K3 = 1 and
K1 = 2, K2 = 2, K3 = 2, and the results are shown in Figs.
3 and 4. We can observe from Figs. 3-4 that the proposed
two-stage MMSE MUD yielded superior performance, as it
used the symbol based MMSE scheme to obtain the reliable
initial estimates for the second stage to facilitate interference
mitigation. We also observe from Figs. 3 and 4 that due to
stage-by-stage reﬁnement the MAI estimation for each group
signal, the performance of proposed multi-stage MMSE group
MUD is very close to that of the symbol based MMSE
detector.

Additional simutions using a different proﬁles of K1, K2,
and K3 were conducted, and the results of their BER perfor-
mances are shown in Figs. 5-7. We can observe from Figs.
5-7 that as the number of transmission increases, all their
performances of the detectors degrade but the new MUDs still
exhibit superior performances for all loading scenarios.
As for the computational complexity, the main computa-
tions of the symbol based MMSE detector in (2) requires
(MR(2N + L− 1))3 complex CMAs to compute the inverse
matrix of the MMSE detector, whereas the proposed two-
stage MMSE MUD needs (MR(2N + L − 1))3 CMAs and
K/2× (2)3 CMAs to compute the the corresponding MMSE
MUDs of the ﬁrst stage and the second stage, respectively. As
for the proposed multi-stage MMSE group MUD, the main
computations requires (8K1)3 + (6K2)3 + (4K3)3 CMAs for
each stage. So for the scenerio where N = 32, L = 3,MR =
3,K1 = 2,K2 = 2,K3 = 2, and the number of stages is set
to 5 for the multi-stage MMSE group MUD, the symbol based
MMSE detector, the proposed two-stage MMSE MUD, and the
proposed multi-stage MMSE group MUD would each requires
7762392, 7762536, and 6336 CMAs, respectively. We note

Abstract— This paper presents an effective multiuser detector
(MUD) for the uplink of dual-signaling multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) code division multiple access (CDMA) systems
over multipath fading channels, where the data are transmitted
using either the spatially multiplexing (SM) or the space-time
block code (STBC) scheme. The new MUD first separates
users into two groups according to their transmission signaling
schemes and then alternatively detects the users in each group
with the removal of iteratively refined soft information-assisted
multiple access interferences (MAI) to enhance the interference
cancellation capability. Moreover, for practical low-complexity
implementations, the users in each group are further partitioned
into smaller subgroups to reduce the the computational load.
Conducted simulations show that the proposed MUD can ren-
der superior performance compared with previous approaches,
especially in highly loaded scenarios.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the assistance of spatial diversity and array gain,
the MIMO systems which deploy multiple antennas at both
transmitters and receivers, can enhance the communication
quality without extra power or bandwidth resources [1]. Two
most common transmit diversity schemes have been developed
to take the advantages of the MIMO systems including the SM
for high transmission rate and the STBC for transmit diver-
sity. Besides, the CDMA, possessing the merits of spectral
efficiency and the robustness against multipath fading [2], has
been a promise for future wireless communications. Therefore,
it is of importance to consider the MIMO CDMA for emerging
wireless communication systems, where such as users employ
either the SM or STBC transmission scheme, referred to as
dual-signaling systems.
The impairment caused by the MAI is a big impediment to
the communication quality of the MIMO CDMA systems, es-
pecially for dual-signaling scenarios. One effective approach to
mitigate the MAI is the MUDs. The optimum MUD, however,
requires prohibitively high complexity and thus suboptimal
MUDs such as the zero forcing (ZF) and the minimum mean-
squared error (MMSE) MUD are more feasible in practice
[2]. For the MIMO systems, Foschini et al. [3] proposed the
renowned vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-
BLAST). However, this symbol-wise recursive detector needs
high computations and the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) structure suffers the setback of error propagation. Ho
et al. [4] extended the V-BLAST to multiuser dual-signaling
environments by ingeniously utilizing the algebraic structure
of the orthogonal codes to reduce the error propagation effect
as well as the computational complexity. However, [4] is
not applicable to practical multipath MIMO channels as the
presumed algebraic structure is no longer hold. Moreover, the
aforementioned detectors will deteriorate substantially in the
highly loaded scenarios.
In this paper, we consider an MUD for multiuser, dual-
signaling MIMO CDMA systems over multipath channels.
The new MUD first separates users into two groups according
to their transmission schemes. The users in each group are
then detected alternatively with the removal of the MAI,
which are incurred from the users in both groups and refined
iteratively with the assistance of the soft-decision outputs
in either the previous or present iteration to enhance the
interference cancellation capability. Note that the proposed
scheme is different from the conventional SIC or the group-
wise SIC in [5], [6], as the interferences removed in each
group are iteratively refined and include the soft estimates from
both groups to render more thorough interference mitigation.
Moreover, for practical implementations, the users in each
group are partitioned into smaller subgroups based on their
effective channel correlations and then detected in parallel by
a bank of MMSE filters to further reduce the computational
load. Conducted simulations show that the proposed MUD can
provide superior performance compared with previous works
especially in highly loaded scenarios.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider an uplink of synchronous MIMO CDMA systems
with each user being equipped with NT = 2 transmit antennas
and NR receive antennas, in which symbols are first BPSK
modulated, spread by their respective spreading codes, and
k = i, and b˜†1i,q(j) = [b˜1i,1(j), . . . , b˜1i,q−1(j), 0, b˜1i,q+1(j −
1), . . . , b˜1i,4(j − 1)]T with b˜1k,q(j) = E{b1k,q(j)} being the
mean of the transmitted symbol for the qth symbol of the kth
user in the SM group at the jth iteration. Also, b˜2(j − 1) is
the soft-decision outputs for the transmitted symbols of the
users in the STBC group at the (j − 1)th iteration.
It is noteworthy that in (3), b˜⊥1i,q(j) forms the MAI from
users in the SM group while b˜2(j − 1) accounts for the
MAI from users in the STBC group. Also note that since the
detection is conducted alternatively between the SM and the
STBC groups, we have to use the soft decision outputs for the
users from the STBC group in the previous iteration.
Next, to estimate the qth symbol of the ith user, we invoke
an MMSE filter given by [2]
w1i,q(j) = R−11i,q(j)p1i,q(j) (4)
where R1i,q(j) = E{y˜1i,q(j)y˜H1i,q(j)} and p1i,q(j) =
E{y˜H1i,q(j)b˜1i,q(j)}. Thereafter, the output of the MMSE
filters for the qth symbol of the ith user is given by
z˜1i,q(j) = wH1i,q(j)y˜1i,q(j) (5)
If we assume that the output of the MMSE filter z˜1i,q(j),
in (5) is approximately Gaussian [6], then z˜1i,q(j) =
m˜1i,q(j)b1i,q(j) + n1i,q(j), where m˜1i,q(j) is the equivalent
strength and n1i,q(j) is the noise with variance σ˜21i,q(j),
which, after some manipulations, can be expressed, respec-
tively, as
m˜1i,q(j) = E{z˜1i,q(j)b1i,q(j)} = wH1i,q(j)HH1 H1e1i,q (6)
where e1i,q is a 4K1×1 elementary vector whose (4(i−1)+
q)th entry is one and the remaining entries are zeros, and
σ˜21i,q(j) = V ar{z˜1i,q(j)}
= wH1i,q(j)R1i,q(j)w1i,q(j)− m˜21i,q(j) (7)
The soft-decision output after the MMSE filter and the MAP
criterion can then be expressed as [6]
λ˜(b1i,q(j)) = log
p(z˜1i,q(j)|b1i,q(j) = +1)
p(z˜1i,q(j)|b1i,q(j) = −1)
=
2z˜1i,q(j)m˜1i,q(j)
σ˜21i,q(j)
(8)
Then, the soft estimated symbol b˜1i,q(j) = tanh(12 λ˜(b1i,q(j)),
1 ≤ i ≤ K1, 1 ≤ q ≤ 4, can be used to construct a new soft
estimate of the qth symbol of the ith user. Finally, taking
the sigmoid function of the soft estimated symbol b˜1i,q(j)
yields the estimate of the qth symbol of the ith user at the
jth iteration.
The updates of the STBC group follow the same steps as
those of the SM group with H1 being replaced by H2. As a
whole, the procedures of the proposed alternating MUD can
be summarized is as follows:
Step 1 (Initialization): Separate the users into the SM and
the STBC groups and carry out the matched filter for each
signaling group by (2). Set the appropriate initial soft-decision
outputs of b˜1(0) and b˜2(0).
Step 2: For the SM group, remove the MAI by (3). For
the qth symbol of the ith user, invoke the group detector
to estimate the weights of the detector w1i,q(j) by (4).
Thereafter, estimate the soft-decision output of each symbol,
λ˜(·), by (5)-(8), which will be employed to refine the estimate
of the MAI in the next iteration.
Step 3: Repeat Step 2 alternatively between the SM and the
STBC groups until convergence.
B. Reduced-Complexity Implementations
To further reduce the complexity, in this subsection we
partition the users in each group into smaller subgroups.
Since the data matrices become smaller, the computations
required to determine the MMSE filters, which dictate the
computational load, can thus be alleviated. Again, for brevity
we only consider the detection for the users in the SM group.
For this, users in the SM group are first ordered according to
their effective channel correlations given by C1 = HH1 H1,
where the entry [C1]i,p denotes the correlation between the
ith user and the pth user. Users are then partitioned into a
prescribed number, say M1, of subgroups according to their
correlations with users having close correlations in the same
subgroups so as to alleviate the interference from the different
subgroups [9].
First, we obtain a rough estimate of the users in the mth
subgroup by
ym1 = (H
m
1 )
Hr, m = 1, · · · ,M1 (9)
where Hm1 = H1(4(m−1)Km1 +1 : 4mKm1 ) in which H1(i :
j) denotes the ith to jth column submatrix of H1 and Km1
denotes the number of users in the mth subgroup. Similar
as the above, after removing the MAI, the residue for the qth
symbol of the ith user in the mth subgroup at the jth iteration,
y˜m1i,q(j), is given by
y˜m1i,q(j) = y
m
1 − (Hm1 )H(H1(b˜m1i,q)⊥(j) +H2b˜2(j − 1)) (10)
for 1 ≤ q ≤ 4, 1 ≤ i ≤ Km1 , m = 1, · · · ,M1, where
(b˜m1i,q)
⊥(j) = [(b˜11(j))
T , · · · , (b˜M11 (j))T ]T denotes the soft-
decision outputs for the transmitted symbols of the users in the
SM group at the jth iteration, in which b˜m1 (j)=[(b˜m11(j))T ,
· · · ,(b˜m1(i−1)(j))T ,(b˜m
†
1i,q(j))

,(b˜m1(i+1)(j))
T
,· · · ,
(b˜m1Km1 (j))
T ]T . b˜m1k(j)=[b˜
m

m

m

T
,
k = i, b˜m†1i,q(j) is replaced the qth element of b˜m1i(j) by zero,
and b˜m1k,q(j) = E{bm1k,q(j)} denotes the mean of the qth
symbol of the kth user in the mth subgroup of the SM group
at the jth iteration.
Note that in (10), (b˜m1i,q)⊥(j) accounts for the MAI from
the users in the SM group while b˜2(j − 1) denotes the MAI
in the STBC group. Again, to estimate the the qth symbol of
the ith user in the mth subgroup, we invoke the MMSE filter
by [2]
wm1i,q(j) = (R
m
1i,q(j))
−1pm1i,q(j) (11)
Next, we compare the BER performance versus the SNR.
We can observe from Fig. 3 that although the V-BLAST em-
ploys the ordered SIC to remove the MAI stage by stage before
conducting the symbol detection, it still does not provide
satisfactory performance as the propagation errors become
more pronounced in such dual-signaling environments. The
proposed AMUD yields the most superior performance, as
it, unlike the SIC, employs the estimated interferences from
both signaling groups. Furthermore, the soft information aided
MAI are iteratively refined so as to attain more thorough
interference cancellation. The AMUD-p is slightly inferior to
the AMUD, as now the users in each subgroup also suffer
the MAI from the other subgroups in the same group, but
its performance is still better than the V-BLAST. As for
complexity, based on the analytic expressions given in Table
1, the numbers of the CMAs required by the V-BLAST,
AMUD, and AMUD-p are 49121856, 3351849, and 1282848,
respectively. Therefore, the computational complexity of the
AMUD is lower than the V-BLAST, as the dimension of
the auto-covariance matrices to be inverted is smaller. The
AMUD-p, despite with slight performance degradation, can
drastically alleviate the computational load by further reducing
the size of the auto-covariance matrices.
To assess the loaded problem, we also compare the BER
performance with different loading rate at SNR = 14 dB,
as shown in Fig. 4. We can observe from Fig. 4 that the
performance deteriorates as the loading rate increases and that
the new MUDs still exhibit superior performance even for
high-loaded scenarios.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper addresses an alternating MUD for the dual-
signaling MIMO CDMA systems. The MUD first groups
users according to their transmission signalings and then
proceeds the detection alternatively with the removal of the
iteratively refined soft interferences in between. To reduce the
computational load, users in each group are further partitioned
into subgroups based on their effective channel correlations.
Conducted simulations verify the effectiveness of the new
MUD especially in highly loaded scenarios.

Abstract—In this paper, we present a multistage group-
decision-aid MUD (MG-MUD) for the uplink multirate code
division multiple access (CDMA) systems. To provide good trade-
off between the performance and computational complexity, the
new MUD is based on the widely MMSE criterion and constructed
by a bank of group detectors in each stage. First, the users are
classified into different groups according to their transmission
rates. Thereafter, these groups of users are detected in parallel by
the set of the group detectors stage by stage. In addition, in each
stage of the new MUD, the decision outputs of the group detectors
are gleaned to refine the interference estimates to enhance the
detection. To further reduce the computational overheads, the
reduce-complexity MG-MUD is also presented, which divides the
multiple symbols of the users in the higher rate groups into
appropriate subgroups according to their transmission orders.
Simulation results show that the proposed MUD can not only
reduce computation load but provide a bit error rate (BER)
performance close to the widely MMSE MUD, including in highly
loaded and overloaded scenarios.
I. INTRODUCTION
Code division multiple access (CDMA), which provides a
set of spreading codes for several users to simultaneously share
a common channel. Due to the merit of spectral efficiency [1],
CDMA is considered as a candidate for current and future
wireless communication systems and hence has inspired a
flurry of researches. One interesting approach of the researches
is multirate CDMA [2], in which the spreading codes with
different lengths are concurrently used for several transmis-
sion rates. Specially, as the growing demands for multimedia
services, the multirate CDMA systems have received rich
attention recently [3]-[8].
However, as the CDMA systems, the performance of the
multirate CDMA systems is also multiple access interference
(MAI) limited. To address this issue, many studies have shown
multiuser detection (MUD) is one of the efficient approaches
to alleviate the MAI effect [5]. The optimal MUD, maximum
likelihood sequence detector, is prohibitively complex due to
computational complexity increasing exponentially with the
number of users. In light of this, suboptimal schemes have
received rich interest. For example, Yang et al. [6] proposed a
decorrelator based scheme to successively cancel interference
and detect the transmitted data symbol by symbol, which
inevitably suffers the serious latency effect. A minimum mean
square error (MMSE) MUD is proposed in [7], which requires
high computational overleads to conduct an inverse of a huge
matrix. In [8], Han et al., used a group successive interference
cancellation (SIC) to design a dual-rate detector, where the
performance will dramatically degrade as the the near far effect
increases. Despite their efficiency in mitigating the MAI, the
performance of the MUDs in [6]-[8] will drastically degrade as
the number of users increases, especially in highly loaded or
overloaded scenarios. Hence, to improve the spectral efficiency,
developing feasible sub-optimum schemes for highly loaded
or overloaded scenarios of multirate CDMA becomes an
important issue.
Recently, studies have shown that the widely MMSE MUD
[9], jointly elaborating the received signal and its complex
conjugate, can enhance the BER performance but still at
expense of heavy computations for an inverse of a huge
matrix. In addition, the group based schemes is usually capable
of saving computations but induces the serious performance
degradation [10]. Therefore, to strike a balance between the
BER performance and the computational overhead, in this
paper we present a multistage group-decision-aid MUD (MG-
MUD) for uplink multirate code division multiple access
(CDMA) systems, where the new MUD is based on the widely
MMSE criterion and constructed by a bank of group detectors
in each stage. First, the users are classified into different
groups according to their transmission rates. Thereafter, these
groups of users are detected in parallel by the set of the group
detectors stage by stage. In addition, in each stage of the new
MUD, the decision outputs of the group detectors are gleaned
to refine the interference estimates to enhance the detection.
To further reduce the computational overheads, the reduce-
complexity MG-MUD is also presented, which divides the
multiple symbols of the users in the higher rate groups into
appropriate subgroups according to their transmission orders.
Simulation results show that the proposed MUD can not only
reduce computation load but provide a bit error rate (BER)
performance close to the widely MMSE MUD, including in
highly loaded and overloaded scenarios.
II. DATA MODEL
Consider an uplink synchronous multirate CDMA system
with the variable spreading length (VSL) scheme to concur-
rently provide several data rate service [2]. Assume that the
978–1–4244–4657–5/09/$25.00 c© 2009 IEEE ICICS 2009
the MF filter, the input to the MMSE detector of group g can
be written as
y˜(g)(j) = C¯(g)
H{r¯−
G∑
i=1,i =g
C¯(g)A(g)z(g)(j − 1)} (10)
In (10), the second term is the interference estimate for the gth
group of the jth stage, g = 1, · · · , G, j ≥ 2, where z(g)(j−1)
is the soft output of the gth group detector of the (j − 1)th
stage. Assume the interference is thoroughly removed from
the received signal and then, similar to (9), the corresponding
MMSE detector of the gth group at the jth stage, can be written
as
W(g)(j) = arg min
W(g)(j)
E{||b(g) −W(g)H (j)y˜(g)(j)||2}
= (R¯(g) + σ2IlgKg )
−1 (11)
where g = 1, · · · , G, and j ≥ 2. IL is the L × L identity
matrix. After the detection of several stage of the MG-MUD,
the final decision output of the gth group in the final stage, is
given by
bˆ(g) = φ{W(g)H (M)y˜(g)(M)}, g = 1, · · · , G (12)
where φ(·) is the decision function and M is the index of the
final stage of the MG-MUD.
As a whole, the steps for the proposed MUD implements
is delineated as follows:
Step 1: First, partition the users into G groups, in which the
users with the same transmission rate are in the same group.
Step 2: Carry out the MF and the MMSE detectors by (9) in
parallel for the groups of the first stage.
Step 3: In the second stage and the follows, remove the MAI
for each group by (10) and then determine the MMSE detectors
in parallel by (11).
Step 4: Repeat Steps 3 until the prescribed stage M and
conduct (12) to estimate the transmitted symbols.
B. Reduced-Complexity MG-MUD
In this subsection, a reduced-complexity MG-MUD is pre-
sented to further reduce the computational load required by
the above MG-MUD. Since determining the MMSE group
detectors in the MG-MUD dominates the main computations,
we hence consider to further partition the higher rate groups
into smaller subgroups to reduce the dimensions of the data
matrix. For example, each user of the gth group transmits lg
symbols and hence based on the the transmission order, the lg
symbols of each user of the gth group can be further divided
into lg subgroups. Note that due to the users in the Gth group
only transmitting a symbol, the group G, therefore, does not
need to be partitioned again. As a result, the received signal
in (7) can be re-written as
r =
G∑
g=1
lg∑
l=1
C(g,l)b(g,l) + n (13)
where C(g,l) and b(g,l) are the NG×lg effective channel matrix
and the lg × 1 transmitted symbol vector for the users in the
lth subgroup of the gth group, 1 ≤ g ≤ G and 1 ≤ l ≤ lg .
Similar to (8) and (9), the output of the MF and the MMSE
detector for the the lth subgroup of the gth group in the first
stage, respectively, can be given by
y¯(g,l)(1) = C¯(g,l)
H
r¯ (14)
= C¯(g,l)
H
(C¯(g,l)b(g,l) + C¯(g,l)
⊥
b(g,l)
⊥
+ n¯)
and
W(g,l)(1) = (R¯(g,l)R¯(g,l)
H
+ C¯(g,l)
⊥
C¯(g,l)
⊥H
+σ2R¯(g,l))−1R¯(g,l) (15)
where C¯(g,l) = [C(g,l)TC(g,l)H ]T and R¯(g,l) = C¯(g,l)H C¯(g,l),
g = 1, · · · , G and l = 1, · · · , lg , represents the auto-correlation
of the effective channel matrixes for the lth subgroup of the gth
group. Furthermore, as the (10) and (11), the corresponding
outputs of the MF filter and the MMSE detector in the jth
stage, j ≥ 2, respectively, can be given by
y˜(g,l)(j) = C¯(g,l)
H{r¯−
G∑
i=1
lg∑
k=1,k =l
C¯(i,k)A(i,k)z(i,k)(j − 1)}
(16)
and
W(g,l)(j) = (R¯(g,l) + σ2Ilg )
−1 (17)
where A(g,k) is the correspondingly transmitted amplitude
matrix and z(g,k)(j − 1) is the correspondingly soft outputs
of the MMSE detector of kth subgroup of the gth group in the
(j − 1)th stage. Finally, like (12), the final decision output of
the lth subgroup of the gth group can be determined by
bˆ(g,l) = φ{W(g,l)H (M)y˜(g,l)(M)} (18)
where g = 1, · · · , G, and l = 1, · · · , lg .
IV. SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, some simulations are conducted to verify
the proposed scheme. Assume each user is assigned a unique
spreading code and individually transmits BPSK modulated
symbols through the independent, flat Rayleigh fading channel
to the base station, where the channel coefficients are fixed
in a data frame. Also, assume the channel state information
and spreading code are perfectly available at the base station.
For comparisons, four MUDs, including the MMSE MUD
[5], the widely MMSE MUD [9], the proposed MG-MUD
and the reduced-complexity MG-MUD, are carried out
in the following simulations and the corresponding BER
performance versus signal to noise ratio (SNR) are shown
in Figs. 1-6. Also, according the simulations, the number of
stages for the proposed MUD is determined as 3, i.e. M = 3.
DUAL-RATE EXAMPLE: In this example, we consider each
of the users is assigned a spreading code with length 8 or 16
according their data rates. i.e. N1 = 8 and N2 = 16. Also,
the transmitted power of all the users is 1 dB. Two scenarios,
K1 = 4, K2 = 4 and K1 = 6, K2 = 6, are considered.

Abstract— This paper presents two simple, yet effective multi-
signaling detectors for combined STBC and SM in MIMO
CDMA systems, in which users can decide their own signaling
modes according to their quality of service (QoS) demand.
The two proposed schemes considered are a two-stage MMSE
method and a multistage MMSE group method, aiming at either
performance enhancement or low implementation complexity.

I. INTRODUCTION
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) has remained a
promising candidate for current and future wireless com-
munication systems due to its merits of spectral efficiency
and robustness to multipath disturbance [1]. Furthermore,
CDMA systems with multiple antennas in both transmitting
and receiving sides, which are often referred to as multiple
input multiple output (MIMO) CDMA systems, have shown
their efficiency at capacity enhancement [2], [3]. Of the
transmission schemes that makes uses of multiple antennas,
two popular schemes have received rich attention, namely the
space-time block code (STBC) scheme for its transmission
reliability [4] and the spatial multiplexing (SM) scheme for
its high throughput [5]. A few researchers have attempted to
combine the STBC and the SM schemes in order to obtain
diversity and multiplexing gains at the same time [6]-[9] . Due
to the demand for communication systems with varying levels
of quality of service (QoS), investigations into combining the
STBC and the SM schemes, i.e. multi-signaling STBC and
SM schemes, is a emerging and vital issue. Also, similar to the
previous works for the combined STBC and SM schemes, the
design of promising receivers is still one of the key problems
for the multi-signaling STBC and SM schemes in MIMO
CDMA systems.
The traditional CDMA systems are well known as multiple
access interference (MAI) limited. As CDMA-like systems,
the MIMO CDMA systems with multi-signaling STBC and
SM schemes inevitably experience the same annoying MAI
disturbance. Studies have shown multiuser detection (MUD)
is one of the more effective methods that mitigate the MAI
disturbance [10]. The optimum MUD, however, call for huge
complexity and thus suboptimal MUDs such as minimum
mean square error (MMSE) MUD, zero forcing (ZF) MUD,
successive interference cancellation (SIC) MUD, and parallel
interference cancellation (PIC) MUD are more feasible in
practice. Based on the trade-off between the bit error rate
(BER) performance and the computational complexity, the
MMSE MUD has received more attention than the others. For
the combined STBC and SM systems, many researches has
been devoted to the design of feasible receivers to facilitate
interference mitigation [8], [9]. For example, Zhao et al. [8]
proposed a group based MMSE scheme which first filters
the received signal of the desired group and then detects the
transmitted symbols. Though it is easy to implement with
low complexity, however it still suffers from performance
degradation. To further enhance the BER performance, a
symbol based MMSE detector was proposed in [9], which
stacks the received signals of two consecutive time durations
in order to increase the dimensions of signal space. However,
in addition to increasing the computational complexity, the
BER performance of the symbol based MMSE detector still
degrades significantly as the amount of the transmission in-
creases [8].
In this paper, we propose two simple, yet effective multi-
signaling detectors for combined STBC and SM in MIMO
CDMA systems, where users can decide their signaling modes
according their quality of service (QoS) demand. First, a two-
stage MMSE MUD is proposed, where in the first stage the
symbol based MMSE decision rule in [9] is adopted to obtain
a tentative symbol estimation. Then, in the second stage, the
transmissions of each user are decoupled into groups of two,
where the size of each group chosen is due to the Alamouti
STBC scheme being considered. Further, using the tentative
symbols, the MAI for each desired group is estimated and
removed from the received signal to alleviate the interference
disturbance, and therefore the symbol decisions of the MMSE
detectors in the second stage can be further enhanced. It is
worthwhile to note that the proposed two-stage MMSE MUD
has the advantage of significant performance gain, but requires
only trivial computations due to the dimension of inverse
matrix of the MMSE detectors in the second stage is reduced
to two. In the second scheme we propose a multi-stage MMSE
group MUD, which decouples the users with the same STBC
and SM signaling mode into the same group and use the
MMSE group MUDs to detect the transmitted symbols of
each group stage by stage. Also, the decisions of the groups
1 ≤ i ≤ K2, and b3i =

T
,
1 ≤ i ≤ K3, where bp1i,q , bp2i,q , and bp3i,q denote the qth
symbols transmitted from the pth antenna of the ith user in
the SM signaling, the hybrid STBC and SM signaling, and
the STBC/SM signaling, respectively.
III. PROPOSED SOFT INFORMATION ASSISTED
SCHEME
In the section, we first review the symbol based MMSE
detector in [9] and then propose a two-stage MMSE MUD.
And for the consideration of low complexity, a multistage
MMSE group MUD will also be presented.
A. Symbol Based MMSE Detector
Based on MMSE decision rule, Tran. et al. [9] proposed a
symbol based MMSE detector, which can be easily extended
to multiuser systems. Using eq. (1), the symbol based MMSE
detector can be given by
Wsym = arg min
W
E
[∣∣∣b−WHr|2∣∣∣]
= HH(HHH + σ2I2MR)
−1 (2)
where IM is the M ×M identity matrix. The final estimation
of b is sgn(WHsymr) where sgn(·) is the sigmoid function.
B. Proposed Two-Stage MMSE Scheme
To enhance the performance of the symbol based MMSE de-
tector, in this subsection we consider a new two-stage MMSE
scheme, which uses the symbol based MMSE detector as the
first stage and a bank of MMSE group MUDs is considered as
the second stage. Due to reasons that transmission signaling
being the Alamouti STBC scheme and complexity considera-
tions, the users are hence separated into groups of size two.
Then, the groups for the SM signaling, the hybrid STBC and
SM signaling, and the STBC/SM signaling, are expressed as

the first group of b1, i.e. {b11i,1 b21i,2}, denoted by the vector
form as b(1)1 . Using the decision outputs of the symbol based
MMSE detector of the first stage to estimate the MAI for b(1)1 ,
then the residual signal for b(1)1 can be estimated by removing
the corresponding MAI from the received signal, which can
be written as
r˜(1)1 = r−H(1)
⊥
1 b˜
(1)⊥
1 (3)
where b˜(1)
⊥
1 denotes the tentative estimate of the first stage for
the symbol vector b that expects the elements corresponding
to the first group of b1 being replaced by zero. H(1)
⊥

we obtain the statistic as y˜(1)1 = H
(1)H
1 r˜
(1)
1 . After that, based
on the MMSE decision rule, the MMSE group MUD can be
expressed by
W(1)1two = arg minW
E
[∣∣∣b(1)1 −WH y˜(1)1 ∣∣∣2]
= (H(1)
H
1 H
(1)
1 + σ
2I2)−1 (4)
and the final decision for b(1)1 is sgn(W
(1)H
1two
y˜(1)1 ). Note that
due to the dimension of H(1)1 being MR(2N + L − 1) × 2,
then the computational load of computing the inverse matrix
for the MMSE group MUD is only 23 complex multiplications
and additions (CMA), which is much less than that required
in eq. (1).
C. Proposed Multi-Stage MMSE Group Scheme
Due to the consideration that computing the inverse matrix
of the MMSE detector in (1) calls for huge computations when
the dimension of the effective channel is high, we then present
a multistage MMSE group scheme with reduced computational
complexity in this subsection. First, according to the signaling
modes, the users are separated into three different groups. In
the first stage of the proposed scheme, the received signal
is passed through the match filter bank and the outputs of the
matched filter bank for the users of the kth group, y¯k(1), k =
1 · · · 3, can be expressed as
y¯k(1) = HHk r = H
H
k (Hkbk+H
⊥
k b
⊥
k +n), 1 ≤ k ≤ 3 (5)
where b⊥k is the symbol vector for the users outside of group
k. Hk and H⊥k are the effective channels matrix containing
the columns corresponding to the users of group k and its
complements, respectively. Then, the optimum MMSE MUD
for the users of group k can be shown as
Wkmulti(1) = arg min
W
E
[∣∣∣bk −WH y¯k(1)∣∣∣2]
= (RkRHk +CkC
H
k + σ
2Rk)−1RHk (6)
where Rk = HHk Hk and Ck = HHk H⊥k . Thereafter, the soft
estimation of the symbol vector of the first stage can be written
as b˜k(1) = WHkmulti(1)y¯k(1). By using the soft estimation
gleaned from the first stage, the MAI of the second stage
can then be estimated and removed from the received signal.
Assuming the MAI can be precisely estimated as the number
of stages increases, then at the mth stage, the residual signal
for the users of the kth group can be written as
r¯k(m) = r−H⊥k b˜⊥k (m) (7)
Furthermore, assume the MAI for the users of the kth group is
perfectly removed from the received signal r, and the statistic

MUD, and that the multi-stage MMSE MUD is substantially
lower in computational complexity than the symbol based
MMSE detector due to the grouping mechanism.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented two simple, yet effective MMSE
MUDs for MIMO CDMA systems with combined STBC
and SM multi-signaling mechanism. Compared to the symbol
based MMSE detector, the proposed two-stage MMSE MUD
can provide better performance with only a slight increase
in computational complexity while the proposed multi-stage
MMSE group MUD can closely match the performance of
the symbol based MMSE detector but requires less complex-
ity. Furnished simulations assess the merits of the proposed
schemes.
