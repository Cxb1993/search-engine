Abstract: This project studies a fault location 
technique for multi-section compound transmission lines 
such as Taipower transmission line system, which 
combine overhead lines with underground power cables, 
using synchronized phasor measurements acquired by 
GPS(Global Positioning System) based PMUs(Phasor 
Measurement Units) or digital relays with embedded 
PMU or by post-fault relay data synchronization 
algorithms. The technique is extended from a two-
terminal fault location method with synchronized phasor 
measurement as inputs. A novel fault section selector is 
proposed to select the fault line section in advance. The 
proposed technique has the ability to locate a fault no 
matter where the fault is on overhead line or 
underground power cable. The adopted technique has a 
solid theoretical foundation and is direct and simple in 
terms of computational complexity. 
 
Index Terms — Fault location, two-terminal compound transmission 
lines, phasor measurement units (PMUs). 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
N electrical utilities, transmission lines form the backbone of 
power systems. With regard to reliability and maintenance 
costs of power delivery, accurate fault location for 
transmission lines is of vital importance in restoring power 
service, and reducing outage time as much as possible.   
Many fault location techniques have been proposed in open 
literature [1]-[22]. Among these techniques, specifically 
Takagi et al. [5], [6] applied the superposition principle to 
estimate single-ended fault location algorithms. The said 
authors’ approaches were very attractive as they did not 
require communication to obtain results. However, algorithms 
based on single-ended data will affect accuracy due to 
variations in source impedances, fault incidence angle, fault 
impedance, and loading conditions. With the advent of Global 
Positioning System (GPS)-based synchronously measuring 
units including phasor measurement units(PMUs) [23], digital 
relays, and digital fault recorders in the early 1990s, GPS-
based fault location techniques [2], [7]-[17] have become 
promising. The main advantage of GPS-based techniques is 
that fault location estimation accuracy is unaffected by 
variations in source impedances and fault impedances due to 
the availability of two-terminal synchronized data. Kezunovc  ´
et al. [7], [8] employed synchronized voltages and currents 
samples at two terminals to estimate the fault location. They 
adopted a time-domain model as basis for the algorithm 
development. However, data must be acquired at a sufficiently 
high sampling rate to provide adequate approximation of the 
derivatives. For their part, Lee et al. [9] utilized synchronized 
phasors at both terminals to obtain the fault location. Their 
algorithm was based on positive and zero sequence 
components of post-fault voltages and currents. In particular, 
errors will be presented when dealing with three-phase faults 
where zero sequence components are absent. Moreover, their 
work only considered a short line model that could not reflect 
the nature of transmission lines. Meanwhile, our previous 
works [10]-[14] proposed fault location/detection techniques 
for transmission lines using synchronized phasor 
measurements. The developed fault location/detection indices 
can be used for transmission line protection as well [15]-[17]. 
 However, due to the high installation cost of PMUs, 
majority of utilities install PMUs only at key substations. Thus, 
the digital measurements at two line terminals are acquired 
asynchronously in the absence of GPS signal. Therefore, fault 
location estimation based on two-terminal data will suffer in 
terms of accuracy. Consequently, fault locations based on 
post-fault data synchronization algorithms were considered in 
some papers. Girgis et al. [18] used an iterative method to 
achieve time synchronization. The fault location method 
proposed by Dalcastagnê et al. [19] was based on voltage 
magnitudes. The proposed work [20] used the imaginary part 
of the fault location index to synchronize the measurements.  
To achieve a compromise between construction cost and 
environmental protection in Taiwan, overhead lines combined 
with underground cables have been widely adopted by the 
TAIPOWER (Taiwan Power Company) with 161 kV and 345 
kV transmission systems. However, the developed techniques 
[1]-[20] cannot locate the fault accurately using these kinds of 
compound lines. Thus, a two-terminal multi-section line 
 
 3 
and R. Therefore, we can acquire two-terminal synchronized 
voltage and current phasors using GPS technique or fault-on 
relay data synchronization algorithms. Lengths of the 
overhead line and underground power cable are denoted as LS 
and LR, respectively. Total line length between buses S and R 
is L. Tap point P of the transmission line is selected as the 
junction point between the LS and LR, which can be defined as 
the virtual receiving end of the overhead line or the virtual 
sending end of the cable.  
 
Fig. 2 One line diagram of a two-section compound transmission line; the thin 
line denotes the overhead line and the bold line denotes the power cable. 
A non-uniform line impedance is obtained in this case due 
to the nature of compound lines. For example, the surge 
impedance of the cable is approximately 10% of that of an 
overhead line [26]. The proposed fault location technique in 
this case is expressed using the following steps: 
Step 1: Assume a fault on the right side of tap point P 
As shown in Fig. 3, we assume that the fault is situated on 
the underground power cable LR. Since the healthy section is 
the overhead line LS, the voltage and current at any point in the 
overhead line can be derived by applying boundary conditions 
of bus S into (3) and (4).  Consequently, we can obtain the 
voltage and current phasors at tap point P in terms of the 
sending end data sets (VS, IS) as:

and current phasors at tap point P and bus R and the line

IS in (6) and equating (5) to the newly derived (6) with the

Step 3: Faulted section identification/fault location 
estimation 
Suppose that a fault occurs at the point F with a distance of 
 5 
line section may be composed by either an overhead line or an 
underground power cable. Two consecutive line sections may 
be either overhead lines, both underground cables, or an 
overhead line with an underground cable. For example, L1 and 
L2 in Fig. 8 are both overhead lines, but their line impedances 
are very different (the conductor of L1 may be ACSR795D, 
while the conductor of L2 may be ACSR636D). 
   Fig. 8 One line diagram of an N-section (N  2) compound transmission line 
The proposed fault location scheme for general two-
terminal N-section compound transmission lines can be 
composed of two portions: 
          a)  The N fault location indices derivation   
In order to illustrate the proposed fault location technique 
in a convenient manner, suppose first that a fault occurs at the 
point F, which is x km away from the receiving end R and on 
the L3 section of a transmission line shown in Fig. 8. The line 
length L1 is defined as reference length of the derived fault 
location indices. The fault location scheme for the fault on the 
L3 section is divided into three procedures, as described below: 
Procedure 1: Derive voltage/current phasors at point P3,R 
As shown in Fig. 8, since the sections L1 and L2 are both 
healthy, the voltage and current at any point on the L1 or L2 
can be derived by applying boundary conditions of bus R into 
(3) and (4) in terms of the line parameters of the L1 or L2. As a 
result, the voltage and current phasors (VP3,R, IP3,R) at tap point 
P3,R can be derived using successive algebraic substitution 
steps from the data sets (VR, IR) at receiving end R. This is 
expressed in matrix form as follows:

Procedure 2: Derive voltage/current phasors at point P3,S 
Since the LN, LN-1,…, L5, and L4 are all healthy sections, we 
can likewise derive the voltage and current phasors (VP3,S, IP3,S) 
at tap point P3,S in Fig. 8 via a series of substitutions from the 
data sets (VS, IS) at sending end S using the following relations:

Procedure 3: fault location indices computation  
The application of the two-terminal fault location technique 
to solve for fault location x’=D3L3 away from the receiving 
end P3,R using two-terminal data sets (VP3,R, IP3,R) and (VP3,S,

written as the following:

anti-aliasing filters with cut-off frequency of 360 Hz. The 
sampling frequency is 1920 Hz (32 sampling points per cycle). 
A digital mimic filter [27] and full-cycle DFT are employed to 
reduce decaying DC offset and to obtain the fundamental 
phasors. 
The simulations have been conducted in reference to 
various system operations and fault conditions. The

as follows:

The fault-on response curves of the proposed fault location 
indices DK (K = 1~4) for a phase-“ab” to ground fault (ab–g 
fault) on the line S-T (external fault) is shown in Fig. 11(a). 
The fault position is set at 6.6 km away from bus S, the fault 
resistance is 1 Ω  and the fault inception angle is zero degree 
with respect to phase-“a” voltage waveform at bus S. Fig. 11(a) 
obviously shows that all of the four indices D1 ~ D4 do not 
converge. Fig. 11(b) shows the fault-on response curves of the 
proposed fault location indices for a phase-“a” to ground fault 
(a–g fault) on the L4 (internal fault). The fault position is set at 
2.712 km (80% of the length L4) away from P4,R, the fault 
resistance is 10 Ω  and the fault inception angle is zero degree 
with respect to phase-“a” voltage at bus S. Fig. 11(b) 
demonstrates that all four indices D1 ~ D4 converge, but only 
D4 falls within the interval [0, 1]. According to the proposed 
faulted section/ fault location identification, the index 
D4=0.7987 p.u. is the correct fault location, and the fault 
location error percentage is 0.0122%.

TABLE II  
PARAMETERS OF A FOUR-SECTION COMPOUND TRANSMISSION LINE SYSTEM 
    
The technique developed so far is assumed for the 
transposed compound lines. Furthermore, the decoupled line 
parameters for the non-transposed transmission lines can be 
obtained using the manner proposed in [10], [12], and [29]. 
The derived line parameters are used to evaluate the 
performance of the proposed fault location scheme for the 
non-transposed lines. The selected 10 fault cases with 
transposed and non-transposed line systems are conducted to 
show the accuracy of the developed faulted line section 
recognition logic, where the line parameters for the non-
transposed line are also obtained from the TAIPOWER system 
and the related data are the same as those of transposed lines 
mentioned previously. The fault conditions and results are 
summarized in Table III. Note that in several tested cases, the 
fault resistance is intentionally set as high as 10 kΩ . Table III 
indicates that the proposed technique can accurately recognize 
the fault section as well as locate the fault even when a high 
impedance fault (HIF) occurs [30]. Therefore, the proposed 
technique is unaffected by the fault path resistance. Moreover, 
we also find that only slight fault location error is introduced 
under a non-transposed line condition.
