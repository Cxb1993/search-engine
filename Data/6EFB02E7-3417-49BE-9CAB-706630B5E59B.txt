represent the SCs more accurately, and more information is provided for designing SCs
in real world applications.

二、緣由與目的
In today’s highly competitive environments, companies around the world have
increasingly emphasized supply chain management (SCM) for designing, implementing,
and evaluating the flow of raw materials, products, and information among participants
like suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers (DCs), and customer zones (CZs).
SCM has been extensively investigated for the past years (for example, Arntzen et al.
1995, Berry and Naim 1996, Erengüc et al. 1999, Karabakal 2000, Min and Zhou 2002,
Smichi-Levi et al. 2003, Gunasekaran 2004, Gunasekaran and Chung 2004,
Gunasekaran et al. 2004, Gunasekaran and Ngai 2004, Yusuf et al. 2004), and many
efforts have been expanded in developing decision models for SCM (Cohen and Lee
1988, Cohen and Lee 1989, Cohen and Moon 1990, Cohen and Moon 1991, Thomas
and Griffin 1996, Vidal and Goetschalckx 1997, Beamon 1998, Lakhal et al. 2001,
Nozick and Turnquist 2001, Goetschalckx et al. 2002, Talluri and Baker 2002). Notably,
there are many uncertain elements in the supply chain (SC) such as customer demands,
lead times, production fluctuation, and their associated costs. A number of works have
proposed stochastic supply chain models that are closer to real situations; for example,
Anupinide and Akella (1993), Lee and Billington (1993), Pyke and Cohen (1993, 1994),
Wang and Gerchak (1996), Hening et al. (1997), Sabri and Beamon (2000), and Vidal
and Goetschalckx (2001). However, in many practical applications, the imprecise
information embedded in SCs may be obtained subjectively (Petrovic et al. 1998,
Petrovic et al. 1999, Petrovic 2001). For example, the uncertain demand may be more
suitably described by linguistic terms such as‘approximately 100 units per week’,‘low’,
‘moderate’, or‘high’rather than by a probability distribution. Bellman and Zadeh (1970)
and Zadeh (1978) introduced fuzzy set theory to handle the uncertainty of this type.
Relatively few studies have devoted to fuzzy SC problems. For example, Petrovic et al.
(1998) modeled and simulated SCs in a fuzzy environment to determine target levels of
inventory under uncertain demands and external supply of raw materials, and further
considering uncertain supply deliveries (Petrovic et al. 1999). Petrovic (2001) extended
these models by considering uncertain lead times during the replenishment process.
Giannoccaro et al. (2003) proposed a fuzzy echelon approach to deal with the
uncertainties of market demands and inventory costs. Fuzzy SC problems that seem to
be more realistic than crisp SC problems deserve further consideration.
Clearly, when some parameters in a SC are fuzzy, the minimal total cost will be
fuzzy as well, and it should be described by a membership function to conserve
completely the fuzziness of input information. If the membership function of some
performance measure for a SC can be derived, a more reasonable and realistic
performance measure can be obtained because it maintains the fuzziness of input
information that can be used to represent the fuzzy SC more accurately. This research
project proposes a multi-product, multi-echelon, and multi-period SC model with fuzzy
parameters; and a solution procedure that is able to calculate the fuzzy objective value
of the fuzzy SC model is also developed. The basic idea is to apply the -cuts and
Zadeh’s extension principle(Yager 1986, Zadeh 1978, Zimmermann 2001) to transform
the fuzzy SC to a family of crisp SCs. A pair of two-level mathematical programs
(Bialas and Karwan 1984, Sakawa et al. 2001) is formulated to calculate the lower and
upper bounds of -cut of the minimal total cost. The membership function of the fuzzy

membership function defined in (2) is theoretically correct, it is not in the usual form for
practical use and is very complicated; it is even very difficult to imagine its shape.
This research project tackles the above difficult problem via mathematical
programming. A pair of mathematical programs is developed to find the -cuts of Z
based on Zadeh’s extension principle. The following section explains this idea.
3. The mathematical approach
From Definition (2), clearly, the membership function Z is also parameterized
by . Thus one approach to construct the membership function Z is to derive the
-cuts of Z . The -cuts of  ( )tvpRC ,  ( )_ twcgWC TC , and 
( )t
cgD are defined as (Klir and
Yuan 2002, Zadeh 1978):

Note that ( )( )tvpRC  , ( )_ ( )twcgWC TC  , and ( )( )tcgD  are crisp sets rather than fuzzy sets.
On the basis of the convexity of fuzzy numbers, the -cuts defined in (3a), (3b), and
(3c) can be expressed in another form, respectively:

8this, the dual of the second-level problem that is a maximization problem is formulated
to be consistent with the maximization operation of the first level. Consequently, Model
(A.2) can be reformulated as Model (A.4) (see Appendix A).
Since ( ) L ( ) ( ) U( ) ( )t t tvp vp vpRC rc RC   and ( ) L ( ) ( ) U( _ ) _ ( _ )t t twcg wcg wcgWC TC wc tc WC TC   ,
t, v, p, w, c, g, in Model (A.4) (see Appendix A), the upper bound of the objective
value can be derived by setting ( ) ( ) U( )t tvp vprc RC  and ( ) ( ) U_ ( _ )t twcg wcgwc tc WC TC  , t,
v, p, w, c, g, which gives the largest feasible region. Moreover, since both the first level
and the second level perform the same maximization operation, their constraints can be
combined to form a classical mathematical program. Consequently, Model (A.4) can be
reformulated as Model (A.5) (see Appendix A) that is a linearly constrained nonlinear
program that can be solved by using several efficient and effective approaches, such as
sequential quadratic programming (SQP) (Bazaraa et al. 1993). In this model, since all
( )t
vprc and
( )_ twcgwc tc have been set to the upper bounds of their -cuts, this guarantees
that ( )Z z  as required by (2).
Solving Models (A.3) and (A.5) (see Appendix A) can obtain the crisp interval
L U[ , ]Z Z  , which is the -cut of Z . An attractive feature of the -cut approach is
that all -cuts form a nested structure with respect to  (Kaufmann 1975). According
to Zadeh’s extension principle(Yager 1986, Zadeh 1978, Zimmermann 2001), Z
defined in (2) is a fuzzy number that possesses convexity (Klir and Yuan 2002,
Zimmermann 2001). Therefore, given ]1,0(, 21  with 21   , the feasible region
defined by 1 in Models (A.3) and (A.5) (see Appendix A) are smaller than those
defined by 2 . Consequently, 1 2
L LZ Z  and 1 2
U UZ Z  ; that is, LZ is non-decreasing
with respect to  and UZ is non-increasing with respect to . Consequently, from
the solutions of Models (A.3) and (A.5) (see Appendix A), the membership function Z
can be constructed.
If both LZ and
UZ are invertible with respect to , then a left shape function
L 1( ) ( )L z Z
 and a right shape function U 1( ) ( )R z Z  can be obtained, from which
the membership function Z is constructed:

Otherwise, in most cases Models (A.3) and (A.5) (see Appendix A) are so
complicated that cannot be solved analytically; the set of intervals
L U{[ , ] | (0, 1]}Z Z   which can be obtained numerically shows the shape of Z by
enumerating different values of .
Note that the minimal total cost derived by using the proposed approach is
expressed by a membership function rather than by a crisp value; i.e., it is a fuzzy
performance measure. The benefit and significance of such a fuzzy performance
measure are it maintaining the fuzziness of input information completely, thus it can
represent the vague systems more accurately. This indicates that the proposed approach
can obtain more realistic performance measures when some data in the supply chain are
ambiguous.
4. Numerical example
To illustrate the proposed method, consider a five-period fuzzy supply chain model

Following the solution procedure stated in Section 3, the lower and upper bounds
of Z at possibility level  can be solved from the pair of mathematical programs
according to Models (A.3) and (A.5) (see Appendix A). Here a mathematical
programming solver Lingo (Lingo User’s Guide1999) is adopted to solve this pair of
mathematical programs. Table 8 lists the -cuts of the minimal total cost at eleven 
values: 0,0.1,…,1.0; and its approximated membership function is shown in Figure 1.
5. Discussion
When the data in the supply chain are fuzzy, the minimal total cost is also fuzzy.
The -cut of Z represents the possibility that the total cost of the SC will appear in
the associated range. Specifically, one extreme end for possibility level =1 shows the
total cost that is most likely to be; and another extreme end =0 shows the range that
the total cost of could appear. In this example, the minimal total cost most likely falls
between 42035 and 44580, and it will never exceed 66530 or fall below 26005. Tables 9
and 10 list the optimal operation plans corresponding to the lower and upper (in
parentheses) bounds of minimal total cost at =1 and =0, respectively. The
information is very useful for designing supply chains.
Note that the lower and upper bounds of the minimal total cost may not occur at
the lower and upper bounds of the fuzzy parameters, respectively. In this example, when
setting the fuzzy numbers as their lower or upper bounds, Model (7) becomes infeasible.
This indicates that the proposed approach is necessary and it indeed provides a useful
solution procedure for fuzzy SC models.
