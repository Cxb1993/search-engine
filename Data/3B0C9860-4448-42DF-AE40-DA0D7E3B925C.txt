Literature 
Before the appearance of NGS, there already existed programs that can assemble the 
traditional Sanger data efficiently, e.g., Celera assembler (1).  The release of NGS 
platforms triggered the developments of new programs for assembling NGS data 
because of the distinct nature of NGS data.  Most of these NGS assemblers, e.g., 
ABySS (2), ALLPATHS (3), CABOG (4), Euler-SR (5), SHARCGS (6), VCAKE 
(7), and Velvet (8,9), were originally designed for one single type of NGS data.  
Although the upgraded versions of some assemblers, e.g., CABOG (10) and Velvet, 
can take two types of NGS data as inputs, the performance is still not satisfactory.  
More critically, when treating a large amount of NGS data, the run-time of CABOG 
can be very long and the memory requirement of Velvet can be huge. 
Some studies have combined 454 and Illumina data for de novo genome assembly.  In 
two studies (11,12), Illumina single-end (SE) or single-read (SR) data were first 
assembled into contigs, which were then fed into Newbler together with 454 data for 
the assembly of a pathogen (6.3 Mb) and a bacterium (3.7 Mb) genome.  To assemble 
a 40 Mb fungus genome, Nowrousian et al. (13) used Velvet to combine 454 SE, 
Illumina SE, and Illumina PE data, an approach we refer to as NVelvet in this study.  
Dalloul et al. (10) modified CABOG to combine 454 and Illumina SE and Illumina 
PE data for the assembly of a turkey genome (~1.1 Gb).  In another study, Tsai et al. 
(14) used Illumina PE reads to close gaps between contigs assembled from 454 reads 
by Newbler (called 454 contigs in this study).  A prerequisite of their approach is 
scaffolding information, which comes with the assembly of 454 PE data.  To our 
knowledge, except for the assembly of a turkey genome using CABOG, all current 
hybrid methods have not been reported to treat large genomes using more than one 
type of NGS data. 
 
Methods 
Draft assembly of the Gasterosteus aculeatus genome  
The current release of the Gasterosteus aculeatus genome (BROAD S1, Feb 2006) is 
provided by the BROAD Institute.  This draft genome was assembled from Sanger 
sequencing data from several mate-pair libraries using Arachne2 (15).  The draft 
genome is 461,533,448 bp in length.  We downloaded the draft genome from 
Ensembl (16).  
NGS data 
The NGS data of Gasterosteus aculeatus (sample SRS010092, same species as the 
one for Sanger sequencing) were downloaded from NCBI Short Sequence Archive 
(17).  This dataset includes 86 files of 454 GS FLX Titanium data (a total of 3.7G 
bases in 11M reads) and 93 files of Illumina PE data with different read numbers, 
read lengths, and insert lengths (a total of >600G bases). 
Assembly pipeline 
Our approach takes the 454 contigs that have been assembled from the 454 data 
described above using Newbler (18)(v2.3) and the Illumina PE reads described above 
as the inputs.  It is then followed by three steps (Fig. 1a): (i) detecting and correcting 
	   4	  
The maximal memory usage during assembly by NVelvet is about 700 GB of RAM.  
When additional Illumina PE data (read length 101, a total of 1.5G read pairs) were 
included, it required more than 1 TB memory, so the assembly process was 
terminated.  In contrast, the assembly using our method and CABOG ran through on a 
server with only 32 GB of RAM.   
In terms of speed, our method was slower than NVelvet.  Our method finished the 
assembly in four days when six processors were used, while NVelvet finished the 
assembly in one day.  However, our method can be speeded up if more processors are 
available.  The assembly using CABOG took much longer time (about two months, 
with six processors) than our method.  We estimate that CABOG will take more than 
one year if all of the Illumina PE data are included. 
c. Detailed sequence comparisons 
Both our and the NVelvet method achieved an >90% coverage of the draft genome, 
while CABOG covered only ~71% of the draft genome (Table 2).  Within the covered 
regions, the number and fraction of mismatches and gaps in our assembly are lower 
than those of the NVelvet assembly, whereas the CABOG assembly has the smallest 
number and fraction of mismatches and gaps.   
All three assemblies contained contigs that cannot be aligned to the draft fish genome 
by BLAT (Table 2).  We found that some of the unaligned contigs in different 
assemblies can be aligned well to each other.  For example, 1,719 of the 2,043 
unaligned CABOG contigs can be aligned to 3,317 of the 6,414 unaligned contigs in 
our assembly (data not shown).  These aligned regions added up to ~5 Mb, 
constituting a significant portion of the unaligned contigs.  This suggests that many of 
the unaligned contigs may indeed exist in the fish genome, and were missed during 
Sanger sequencing or assembly.  However, not all the unaligned contigs are likely 
novel.  Among the 20,664 unaligned NVelvet contigs, 14,896 contigs are short (<500 
bp) and 15,223 contigs have a low Illumina read coverage (<5X).  In contrast, the 
majority of our unaligned contigs are long (>=500 bp, Table 3).  Moreover, among 
our 2,346 short and unaligned contigs, more than half (1,271 contigs) have a good 
coverage by Illumina reads (>=5X).  These suggest a high quality of our assembly.  
Interestingly, in our 1,075 contigs with a low Illumina read coverage, 852 do not have 
any Illumina read mappings.

Conclusion 
We have developed a stepwise method that is able to assemble a large genome using 
both 454 and Illumina PE data.  Specifically, our method avoids a large memory 
requirement and a long run-time, which arise when treating large genomes.  Our 
method achieved a better assembly of the ~460 Mb Gasterosteus aculeatus genome 
compared with two other methods: modified CABOG and modified Velvet.  Our 
assembly is better not only in statistics, but also in terms of detailed sequence 
alignments with the published genome draft.  Our method can also be applied to 
improve any assembly with Illumina PE data.  Currently, only few methods have been 
proposed to combine 454 and Illumina PE data and perhaps none can effectively treat 
a huge amount of NGS data.  As the number of unsolved large genomes is still large, 
we believe that our method will be useful for the de novo assembly of large genomes.
