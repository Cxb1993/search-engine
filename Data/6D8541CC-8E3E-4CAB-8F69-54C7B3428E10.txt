 (2) Time-dependent mechanical

ZrCuTiTa thin films under 
nanoindentation

Abstract. A series of Ta-modified amorphous 
ZrCuTi thin films were produced by magnetron 
sputter deposition techniques.  Microstructural 
examination using transmission electron microscopy 
indicated that the Ta addition induced phase 
separation and resulted in two-phase glass structures.  
The composition and morphology (such as density, 
size, and volume fraction) of the second-phase 
structure were characterized.  The mechanical 
properties, including modulus and hardness, were 
measured using a nanoindentation method and 
compared with the predictions from theoretical 
models.  Nanoindentation creep experiments were 
also conducted to evaluate the viscoelastic response 
of the two-phase glasses.  The characteristic 
relaxation time was found to be a function of the 
glass transition temperature.  Its physical 
significance was discussed.

1.  Introduction 
Metallic glasses (MG) have been extensively 
studied because their excellent mechanical properties, 
such as high strength [1], low elastic modulus [2], 
and good excellent wear resistance [3]. Despite these 
good properties, it is also known that MGs are lack 
of plasticity, especially in tension.  This limits the 
wide application of metallic glasses.  In 
compression, however, MGs can exhibit large 
plasticity.  For example, a Zr-Cu-Ni-Al bulk 
metallic glass (BMG) has been demonstrated to be 
superplastic at room temperature [4].  This 
particular alloy was also shown using transmission 
electron microscopy to have a two-phase structure.   
It was further pointed out [5-7] that upon 
solidification of the Zr-Cu-Ni-Al system, due to the 
positive heat of mixing between Cu and Ni (+4 
kJ/mol), the liquid melt separates into Cu-rich and 
Ni-rich melts along spinodal boundaries under 
appropriate cooling rate.  This results in the 
formation of a mixture of softer Cu-rich and harder 
Ni-rich domains.  Under subsequently deformation, 
interaction between the Cu-rich and Ni-rich domains 
induces the formation of multiple shear bands and 
leads to a large plasticity.  However, there is no 
systematic study of the compositional change on the 
phase distribution and morphology (e.g., size, shape 
and fraction), and, thus, the mechanical behavior.  
 6
treat the system as a multi-component system, and 
calculate the modulus based on both an isostrain [11] 
or isostress [11,12] model from the individual 
constituent elements as 
 
Eistrain CZrEZr CCuECu CTiETi CTa ETa , (1) 
 
Eistress  (CZr EZr1 CCuECu1 CTiETi1 CTa ETa1)1
, (2) 
where CZr, CCu, CTi and CTa are the content of Zr, Cu, 
Ti and Ta, respectively.  The reference values of EZr, 
ECu, ETi and ETa are 125 [13], 128 [14], 128 [15], and 
220 [8] GPa, respectively.  The estimated and 
measured elastic moduli are plotted in Fig. 3.  It is 
obvious that there is considerable discrepancy 
between the calculations and measurements.  The 
origins of this discrepancy will be discussed later.  
 
3.3. Time-dependent plasticity (nanoindentation 
creep) 
For the time-dependent mechanical behavior, 
we carried out nanoindentation creep under a 
constant load of 5 mN with an initial loading rate of 
0.05 mNs-1.  The time-displacement (t-h) curves of 
Zr-rich, Ta-rich, and Ta-rich nanocrystalline films are 
depicted in Figs. 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c), respectively.  
The displacement in fact consists of deformation 
from both creep and anelasticity.  The existence of 
anelasticity is demonstrated in an unloading/holding 
test, as shown in Fig. 5, in which a sample was 
initially indented under a constant load of 5 mN for 
60 seconds.  The sample was, then, unloaded at a 
rate of 0.5 mNs-1 to a load level of 0.25 mN and held 
at this lower load for another 60 s, allowing the 
sample to relax.  It is evident that there is a back 
flow, which is an indication of anelastic deformation.   
Thus, the indentation creep data can be analyzed 
using a combination of Maxwell (for creep) and 
Kevin (for anelatsicity) equations, that is, 
kttJh  ))exp(1(  , (3) 
where h is the indentation depth, 　 is the 
characteristic relaxation time for anelasticity, J is the 
pre-factor displacement for the exponential 
anelasticity term and k is the pre-factor the linear 
term for creep.  The coefficient of determination (R2) 
in all specimens are higher than 0.99.  The fitting 
parameters for each alloy films are listed in Table 2.   
 
4.  Discussion 
As indicated in Fig. 3, the modulus of 
amorphous ZrCuTiTa thin films increases 
monotonically with Ta content.  It is also evident 
that the measured moduli do not match with the 
prediction of either the isostrain or isostress model, 
assuming each composition behaves like a 
solid-solution alloy.  The discrepancy may be 
caused by several microstructural factors.  First, the 
size and distribution of the second phase can affect 
the resultant modulus of a composite.  In the current 
thin films, as shown in Fig. 1, the quantitative 
distribution of the second phase is difficult to assess.  
Second, there is a shuffling of Ta atoms between the 
two phases during the formation of the two-phase 
alloy, but the partitioning of Ta in each phase is 
uncertain.  Last but not the least, both isostress and 
isostrain models assume that the two phases act 
independent, namely, the mechanical response of the 
composite is simply the superposition of the two 
phases under stresses.  It is probably not the case.  
The boundary between the two phases is not sharp 
and a transition zone between the Zr-rich and Ta-rich 
phases is anticipated.  The ability of this transition 
layer to transfer load and its structure and thickness 
are imperative to the resultant mechanical properties 
of the composite.  Unfortunately, structural 
information of this layer is extremely difficult to 
obtain.     
For the time-dependent mechanical behavior of 
the current ZrCuTiTa thin films, the pre-factor of the 
linear term, k, in Eq. (3) determines the creep 
resistance of the alloy.  As indicated in Table 2, k is 
generally small and appears to be independent on the 
Ta content.  It is resulted from the relatively low 
testing temperature (i.e. room temperature), which 
limits the creep typically caused by long-range 
diffusion of atoms.  
In terms of 　 in Zr-rich and Ta-rich TFMGs, 
the characteristic relaxation time, 　 shown in Eq. (3), 
can be expressed by an Arrhenius equation with an 
activation energy ( E　 a), as shown below.  
)
RT

  ,                 
where R and T are the gas constant and temperature.  
The pre-factor (  ) mostly is within 10-13-10-18 s.  
Based on the study of Yu et al. [16], the 
time-dependent mechanical behavior of amorphous 
alloys is dominated by 　-relaxation with an 
activation energy that is closely related to the glass 
transition temperature and, specifically, it is 26RTg.  
Since the testing temperature is at 300 K, Eq. (4) can 
be readily rearranged as 
gT087.0lnln   .
The functional relationship between 　 and Tg is 
shown in Fig. 6.  Despite some datum variations, 
there are apparently two regions exhibiting different 
slopes.  In the low Tg region (i.e. Zr-based TFMGs), 
the slope is approximately 0.08 as predicted by Eq. 
(5).  However, in the high Tg region (i.e. Ta-based 
TFMGs), the slope is much smaller (~0.0015).  It is 
unclear of the discrepancy.  However, it may be 
associated with different hopping modes of quantized 
shear transformation zones (STZ) in their ergodic 
space, as pointed out recently by Atzmon’s group 
[17].  Additional study of the long-term anelasticity 
of these films, including tests at high temperatures, to 
shed lights on the relaxation behavior is underway.

Abstract. The tensile behaviors of the monolithic 
ZrCu thin film metallic glass, monolithic crystalline 
Cu thin film, and the ZrCu/Cu multilayered thin 
films with various individual layered thicknesses 
deposited on the polyimide foil have been 
investigated. The modulus and strength of the 
multilayered thin films are demonstrated to be 
consistent with the theoretical Rule of Mixture values. 
As the individual layer thickness decreases from 100 
to 10 nm, the Young’s moduli are varied slightly. 
However, the maximum tensile stress exhibits a 
highest value for the 25 nm layer thickness. The 
higher crack spacing, or the lower crack density, of 
this 25 nm multilayer film leads to the highest 
strength.

1. Introduction 
Metallic glasses (MGs) with unique atomic 
structures and excellent mechanical properties are 
becoming more and more attractive. They have 
become potential materials for Micro 
Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and other 
applications owing to their high strength, good 
corrosion resistance, and great forming ability in the 
viscous state. [1-4]. However, due to the ductility 
problem, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are not easy 
to be formed or processed into MEMS components. 
Recently, sputtering techniques have been employed 
to manufacture MGs into thin film metallic glasses 
(TFMGs) [5-7]. Nevertheless, the inherent drawback

3.  Results and Discussion 
To identify the structure of multilayered thin 
films, the representative XRD patterns of 
polyimide-supported ZrCu/Cu multilayered thin film 
with individual layered thickness of 100 nm are 
shown in Figure 1. The inclined patterns of the XRD 
results are due to the effect of PI substrates. In Figure 
1, the PI substrate presents a diffused peak at the 2 
diffraction angle range of 30° to 35°. According to 
our previous works on the ZrCu TFMG, a broad 
diffraction hump can be observed at the 2 
diffraction angle range of 38° to 46°. Moreover, the 
nanocrystalline Cu thin film exhibits the peaks of 
(111), (200) and (220) planes at 43.4°, 50.5° and 
74.2°, respectively. The highly textured {111} plane 
is contributed by the nanocrystalline face-centered 
cubic Cu layers.  
In this study, all the multilayered specimens 
have the ZrCu TFMG as the top layer to ensure the 
initiation of shear bands from this layer. Figure 2 
shows the SEM surface morphologies of the 
PI-supported multilayered thin films. Under low 
magnifications as shown in the left side of Figures 
2(a) and 2(b), the as-deposited specimens with 
various individual layered thicknesses show the 
smooth surfaces with slight contrast from huge 
height difference topography. However, at a high 
magnification of 50,000X as shown in the right side 
of Figures 2(a) and 2(b), there are some inevitable 
sphere domains on the surface, since the sputtered 
film was grown and impinged from isolated islands. 
The morphology is consistent with the observations 
of Zr-based amorphous films reported by Raible et al. 
[22]  
The mechanical properties were examined by 
tensile testing and the reported method in reference 
[23] was utilized in this study. The tensile load of the 
50-μm-thick uncoated PI substrates were averaged 
and fitted with a fourth-order polynomial as follows: 
 
,30584.2034695503.404325815.32188037.15 432  F
  
where F is the tensile load and  is the tensile strain. 
The result calculated from the polynomial form is 
regarded as the reference of uncoated PI substrate, as 
shown in Fig. 3(a). Then, the tensile stress of thin 
film (σfilm) can be extracted by deducting the 
contribution of the uncoated PI substrate from the 
total load: 
),(1 PItotal
filmfilm
film FFtw
            (2) 
where wfilm, tfilm, Ftotal, and FPI are the width and 
thickness of the coated film, and the tensile load for 
the coated specimen and the uncoated PI substrate, 
respectively [16].  
According to Equation (2), the engineering 
stress-strain curves of the 1-μm-thick monolithic 
ZrCu TFMG and monolithic nanocrystalline Cu thin 
film can be extracted as plotted in Figure 4(b). The 
tensile moduli of the monolithic ZrCu TFMG and Cu 
thin film are determined to be 83 GPa and 104 GPa, 
respectively. These experimental values are close to 
the results from nanoindentation, which are 93 GPa 
for ZrCu and 127 GPa for Cu [19,20]. The slightly 
lower moduli measured from the micro-scaled 
minitester, as compared with the moduli from 
nanoindentation, are well expected, since there are 
more size constraint effects for the nanoindentation 
measurement [24,25]. 
Based on the data, the theoretical moduli of 
multilayered thin films can be obtained from an 
iso-strain model of Rule of Mixture (ROM) as 
expressed by:   ,1 CuZrCuMultilayer fEEfE          (3) 
where Emultilayer, EZrCu, and ECu are the tensile moduli 
of the multilayer thin film, ZrCu TFMG, and 
nanocrystalline Cu film, respectively, and f is the 
volume fraction of the nanocrystalline Cu layer in the 
multilayer thin films. In this research, the volume 
fraction for all the 10 to 100 nm multilayered films is 
set to be the same, i.e., 50 vol%. The theoretical 
value of the modulus can thus be calculated by ROM 
as 94 GPa. The results from tensile test and 
nanoindentation are all summarized in Table 1. 
The representative engineering stress-strain 
curves of the ZrCu/Cu multilayered thin films, with 
individual layered thicknesses of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 
100 nm, are presented in Figure 3(c). The moduli of 
these samples are all in the range of 87 ± 10 GPa, 
close to the theoretical ROM prediction of 94 GPa. 
The modulus with various individual layer 
thicknesses shows the slight variation and it is barely 
affected by the layer thickness due to its intrinsic 
characteristic. These results are considered to be 
reasonable and predictable.  
The maximum stresses of multilayered thin 
films with various layered thicknesses of 10, 25, 50, 
75, and 100 nm are extracted to be 550 ± 20, 765 ± 
30, 740 ± 12, 1030 ± 15, and 540 ± 10 MPa, 
respectively, as plotted in Figure 4. The variation of 
the stress as a function of layer thickness can be 
explained from two aspects. The first one is from the 
nanocrystalline Cu layers, rationalizing in terms of 
the Hall-Petch type relationship for multilayered 
materials [26]. Here the individual Cu layer thickness 
can be regarded as the grain size in the Hall–Petch 
equation; the smaller the thickness, the stronger the 
Cu layers. The second aspect is from the amorphous 
ZrCu layers. Shear banding predominates over the 
deformation process, which is less sensitive with 
respect to the thickness in the range of 25 to 100 nm. 
Judging from these two aspects, the increasing stress 
from 100 to 25 nm is logical.  
However, as the thickness of nanocrystalline or 
amorphous layer is reduced to 10 nm, the effects of 
layer roughness and interface become critical under 
tension. The uneven layer thickness for the 10/10 nm

(4) Mechanical characteristics 
of Mg-Cu-Zr thin film metallic 
glasses 
 
S. Y. Kuan, H. S. Chou, J. C. Huang* 
 
Abstract   For improving the ductility of metallic 
glasses, nanocrystals within the amorphous matrix 
are frequently intentionally added. In this study, the 
 14
as Mg39 and Mg43, they are basically fully 
amorphous. With increasing Mg content from 48 to 
55 at%, a very minor peak at 34.7o is found, 
corresponding to the (0002) diffraction plane of the 
hexagonal close-packed (HCP) Mg. For Mg78, Mg84 
and pure Mg, minor peaks at 36.8o and 48o 
correspond to (1011) and (1012) planes are also 
seen. The strong (0002) basal plane texture is clearly 
seen. Here, we can find that the transition stage from 
fully amorphous to fully crystalline phase in the 
MgCuZr alloy system resides from 43 to 73 at% Mg. 
This transition composition range is somewhat wider 
than other thin film systems, such as ZrCuTiTa [15], 
Cu-W [16] and Ag-Ni [17] (the latter three are all 
narrow within ~10 at%).   
The mutual heat of mixing for Mg-Cu, Zr-Cu 
and Mg-Zr, equals to -3, -23, and +6 kJ/mol, 
respectively [18], meaning Mg would be pushed out 
by Zr. As Mg content is greater than 73 at%, the 
dominant Mg would supersaturate Zr and Cu, 
forming the Mg-based crystalline phase. Note that we 
might consider that Zr could also precipitate out in 
the Mg matrix when Mg content is high. However, 
this did not happen. This is because that, with the 
highly negative heat of mixing between Zr and Cu, 
these two atoms would attract each other strongly, 
forming tight Zr-Cu bonds and difficult to be 
separated. The strong attractive force between Zr and 
Cu suppress the Zr precipitation in the Mg matrix 
when the Mg content is high. 
 Figure 2(a) shows the nanoindentation 
load-displacement curves, which can be divided into 
two groups. The first group for Mg39 to Mg55 
possesses the pop-in events with increasing applied 
load, typical for metallic glasses or metallic glass 
composites under nanoindentation; and the second 
one for Mg 73 to pure Mg shows smooth curves, 
typical for ductile crystalline metals. Pop-in events 
are the discontinuous strain caused by the shear band 
propagations within the metallic glasses. As the Mg 
particles are precipitated, the shear band 
propagations would be interacted and suppressed by 
the Mg particles in the first group. For the other 
group, crystalline Mg becomes the matrix and the 
deformation mechanism now is changed to 
dislocation activity, not shear banding. As a result, 
the load-displacement curve becomes smooth. The 
elastic modulus (E) and hardness (H) of the MgCuZr 
alloy thin films, measured by nanoindentation, are 
shown in Fig. 2(b). It is obvious that the modulus 
decreases from ~90 to ~70 GPa, and hardness from 
~5.5 to ~1.5 GPa, with increasing Mg content. We 
can find that the trend of elastic modulus is slightly 
irregular, presumably resulting from the complicated 
influence of bonding length between Mg and Zr/Cu 
[15, 19]. For Mg73 to Mg84, the hardness remains 
around 3.2 GPa. Basu et al. [20] also found that the 
modulus would rise with a high volume fraction of 
crystalline phase in partially crystalline La-based 
bulk metallic glass system. It appears that the 
modulus has been affected via the interaction and 
formation of rigid networks of crystalline phases. 
This is a tremendous improvement, compared with 
the hardness of about 0.4-0.8 GPa for commercial 
Mg alloys possessing grain sizes ~100 m [21], or 
with the hardness of 2 GPa for nanocrystalline Mg 
alloys [22]. 
Microcompression testing was utilized for 
extracting the uniaxial compression mechanical 
characteristics. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the 
metallic-glass or metallic-glass composite MgCuZr 
thin films, i.e., Mg39 to Mg73, exhibit the 
characteristics of strain bursts. The first apparent 
strain burst is usually defined as the yield stress. In 
comparison, some gradual transformation from 
elastic to plastic deformation can be found in Mg78, 
Mg84 and pure Mg. Figure 3(b) shows the variation 
trend of the yield stress with increasing Mg content. 
Note that even for Mg78 and Mg84, with 
predominant Mg crystalline phase retained, the yield 
stress can still maintain around 1.5 GPa, significantly 
greater than the yield stress for pure Mg or 
commercial Mg alloys (around 0.1 to 0.4 GPa).  
 Figure 4 shows the deformed Mg39, Mg73, 
Mg84 and pure Mg micropillars. For the Mg39 
micropillar in Fig. 4(a) and the Mg73 micropillar in 
Fig. 4(b), the deformation characteristics are still 
dominated by shear band propagation, but the higher 
Mg-containing metallic glass composites typically 
show more ductile multiple shear banding. For Mg84 
in Fig. 4(c) and pure Mg in Fig. 4(d), the deformation 
appears to be gradually governed by the deformation 
instability of nanocrystalline Mg. When the volume 
fraction of Mg particles increases, the structures of 
MgCuZr thin films with high Mg contents become a 
crystalline matrix with dispersed metallic glassy 
phases. As a result, the propensity of shear band 
propagation, or the strain discontinuity, is reduced 
with increasing Mg content. 
 TEM characterization was conducted on the 
MgCuZr thin films with various Mg contents. 
Figures 5 present the bright and dark field images, 
with the inserted diffraction pattern, showing the 
separated nanocrystalline Mg HCP phase, with a 
mean particle size of ~50 nm. In the Mg39 to Mg55 
films, the microstructure contains an amorphous 
matrix with minor nanocrystalline Mg particles. With 
increasing Mg content in the Mg73, Mg78 and Mg84 
films, the microstructure becomes the dominant HCP 
Mg matrix (of an average grain size in the 
neighborhood of 100 nm) with minor amorphous 
domains. These Mg grains are predominantly 
oriented with their (0002) basal planes lying on the 
thin film plane, meaning the Mg grains are highly 
textured, consistent with the XRD patterns.  
Note that the hardness readings of the MgCuZr 
thin films shown in Fig. 2(b) are seen to decreases 
appreciably with increasing Mg content. However, 
the yield stress data shown in Fig. 3(b) do not show 
the similar trend. Mg73, Mg78, and Mg84 can still

where  is an effective hopping integral, rij is the distance between atoms i and j, and r0 is the 
first-neighbor distance. The parameters , A, p , q, 
and r0 for Cu and Zr were determined on the basis of 
the experimentally obtained values of cohesive 
energy, lattice parameter, bulk modulus, and shear 
elastic constants of Cu and Zr [25,26]. Table 1 lists 
parameters used for the potential. The material 
properties of Cu and Zr were accurately predicted by 
the TB potentials using these parameters [27,28]. To 
get the accurate modeling of Zr-Cu interaction for 
ZrCu metallic glass, the force matching method was 
used to determine the tight-binding potential 
parameters for the Zr-Cu interaction with the 
corresponding forces from the density functional 
theory (DFT) calculations [29]. Simulated results for 
the lattice volume, radius distribution and binding 
energies were very close to the experimental values, 
indicating these DFT settings were accurate enough 
in predicting the material properties for amorphous 
ZrCu and crystalline Zr systems. 
Before determining the mechanical properties of 
ZrCu metallic glass, the most important step is to 
obtain a reliable amorphous ZrCu configuration. In 
our basin-hopping (BH) method, the conjugate 
gradient method was replaced by the limited memory 
BFGS method (LBFGS, BFGS representing for four 
initiators, Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfaeb and Shanno) 
[30], which can be used to simulate a system 
consisting of a large number of atoms. Furthermore, 
the simulated annealing (SA) method was also 
implemented with the BH method to be a SABH 
method, which included a wider search within the 
energy space. The resulting simulated X-ray 
diffraction pattern was consistent with the 
experiment with a diffuse diffraction hump over 2 
=30-45o. 
MS simulation was subsequently employed to 
investigate the mechanical properties of 
ZrCu/Zr/ZrCu (top/middle/bottom) nanolaminates. 
Limited by simulation time, the simulated 
ZrCu/Zr/ZrCu nanolaminate pillar was much smaller 
than the experimental one, but still with the slight 
taper of 3o, top pillar diameter ~8.0 nm, bottom pillar 
diameter ~11.5 nm, and pillar height ~35.0 nm. 
During the compression process, these structures are 
fixed by the substrate with a volume of 36364 
nm3. The interface between ZrCu and Zr layers were 
modeled by three interfacial interaction energy 
conditions, namely, the highly stable (HS), 
intermediately stable (IS), and less stable (LS) 
interfaces, which correspond to the well bonded 
(with low interfacial energy and high interfacial 
shear strength), intermediately bonded, and poorly 
bonded (with high interfacial energy and low 
interfacial shear strength) interfaces, respectively.  
 
Results and discussion  
Experimental observations 
The inclined and horizontal multilayered pillars 
(denoted as samples I and H, respectively) fabricated 
by focused ion beam machining are shown in Fig. 1. 
The individual thickness of the ZrCu layer is 500 nm 
and that of the nanocrystalline Zr layers varies within 
500-800 nm. The diameter of the top micropillar is 
about 900 nm and the taper angle of the pillar is 
about 2-3o. To ensure that the flat punch would 
accurately contact the pillar top and to minimize the 
effect of high drift rate (>1 nm/s) under load-control 
mode, we performed several initial tryouts to 
examine the instantaneous load-displacement curve.  
Since the deformation behavior of sample H has 
been presented previously [8,10,13], test and 
characterization are mainly focused on sample I. 
After compressing the inclined pillar to the preset 
displacement of 200 nm (or about 8% strain), the 
deformed pillar was examined by SEM around its 
circumference, as shown in Fig. 2. Deformation is 
noted to be mainly limited in the top amorphous 
ZrCu and crystalline Zr layers, and the interface 
between these layers. There are traces of several 
parallel slip lines in the Zr layer, and no localized 
shear band is found in the upper amorphous CuZr 
layer. The distortion of this amorphous layer is 
apparently in compliance with the plastic 
deformation of the Zr layer underneath.   
To further elucidate the deformation 
characteristics of sample I, additional compressive 
tests were conducted till the sample fracture (at ~ 
18% strain). Micrographs of a fractured pillar taken 
from two opposite sides are shown in Fig. 3. The 
fracture morphology indicates that shear fracture was 
initiated at the top interface as marked by arrow, 
probably caused initially by the strain mismatch 
between the crystalline and amorphous layers at this 
interface, followed by the plastic deformation of the 
middle Zr layer and, then, led to extensive sliding of 
the second interface. The test sample did not 
completely shear off or fracture along the interfaces 
before the large shear deformation (~10% strain). 
This indicates that the sample I can accommodate 
significant shear (>10%) and the a-c interfaces must 
be sufficiently strong.  
The compressive stress-strain curves of samples 
H and I are depicted in Fig. 4. For sample H, the 
Young’s modulus and normal yield strength are about 
120±4 GPa and 2.4±2 GPa, respectively, as listed in 
Table 2. These experimentally measured data are in 
agreement with the iso-stress rule-of-mixture 
prediction, based on the data from the amorphous 
ZrCu (E= 92 GPa and YS= 2.6 GPa) and 
nanocrystalline Zr (E=129 GPa and YS=3.0 GPa) 
 20
and yield strength (YS) for sample H were 125 and 
2.6 GPa, respectively, in good agreement with the 
measurements, as compared in Table 2. The 
simulated sample morphologies of sample H 
compressively strained to ~5%, 10%, and 16% are 
shown in Fig. 9. Resulting from the 3° taper angle, 
the predominant deformation was concentrated 
within the upper half of the pillar. It is observed that 
the deformation was initiated from the upper 
interface (between the top ZrCu and middle Zr layers) 
as well as the very top surface. Sample distortion, in 
particular in the vicinity of the interface, alters the 
local stress at the interface from uniaxial to 
multiaxial and causes a lateral material flow. 
However, this lateral outward sliding is not 
catastrophically, which suggests that the interface is 
weaker than the intrinsic strengths of ZrCu and Zr 
layers. The experimental yield strengths listed in 
Table 2 are 2.6 GPa for ZrCu, 3.0 GPa for Zr, and 
2.2-2.6 GPa for sample H. Since the deformation 
near the yielding stage was concentrated on the 
interface, we can estimate the compressive normal 
strength of the interface region to be about 2.4±0.2 
GPa.  
The Young’s modulus (E) and yield strength (YS) 
of sample I were simulated to be 48 GPa and 1.8 GPa 
for the HS interface, 45 GPa and 1.7 GPa for the IS 
pillar, and 38 GPa and 1.2 GPa for the LS case, also 
in good agreement with the measured values, 42 GPa 
and 1.9 GPa, as compared in Table 2. Note that the 
yield strength of the HS and IS interfaces are not far 
apart. Since the interface is along the 45o with respect 
to the compressive axis, the interface shear strength 
can be roughly estimated to be cos45o x YS, resulting 
in 1.3, 1.2, and 0.9 GPa for the HS, IS and LS 
interfaces, respectively. The experimental 
measurement of YS = 1.9 GPa and interface shear 
strength of 1.3 GPa are both closer to that for the HS 
interfaces, suggesting the interface between ZrCu 
and Zr layers is relatively strong, with an interfacial 
shear strength about 1.3 GPa.  
The simulated results for sample I with HS and 
LS interfaces are presented in Figs. 10 and 11. It 
appears that deformation behaviors in samples with 
stronger and weaker interfaces are not much different. 
They both start from the interface sliding, with more 
severe sliding and preferential deformation along the 
upper interface region in the LS case. However, for 
the LS interface, extensive interface sliding and 
shearing has led to bond breakage or crack formation 
in pillar strained to over 10%, as shown in Fig. 11. 
Due to the 3° taper angle, the lower interface and 
bottom ZrCu layer deformed much less. The lower 
interface does not move even after straining to 18%. 
This is in contrast to the experiment (Fig. 5) in which 
the lower interface begins to slide after about 15% 
strain and induces the final failure. The difference 
might be caused by the activation of sliding on the 
lower interface experimentally upon pronounced 
compression strain, which made the upper pillar part 
barreled to a level equal to the cross-sectional area of 
the lower pillar part. In simulation, the lower half of 
the pillar sample remained intact. The 3° taper angle 
may be excessive in our MS simulation. A low taper 
angle of 2° might reveal the actual situation.  
To reveal the atomic movement more clearly, Fig. 
12 shows only the atoms that have displaced, 
removing those atoms undeformed, for the HS, IS 
and LS pillars strained to about 8%. With a weaker 
interface in the LS case, the atomic deformation was 
more severe. With increasing degree of shearing and 
sliding along the weaker interface from HS to IS and 
then to LS pillars, the atom movements in the upper 
and lower ZrCu layers also become more intense 
according as a result of mutual accommodation 
between layers.  
In previous MD simulations [7] for the tension 
simulation on ZrCu/Cu/ZrCu nanolaminate, it was 
found that dislocations are initially nucleated from 
the amorphous-crystal interfaces and then glide 
across the face-centered cubic Cu nanocrystal layer. 
The dislocations was simulated to be absorbed at the 
opposite amorphous-crystal interfaces, so ZrCu 
amorphous layer may be regarded as both a 
dislocation source and sink to mediate inelastic shear 
or slip transfer. In comparison with our simulation 
results, the deformation of hcp Zr layer also starts 
from the upper interface sliding, but the dominant 
deformation appears to be nano-twinning, rather than 
dislocations. The current simulation is in fact 
consistent with our previous TEM characterization in 
the multilayered pillar [8].   
 
Closing remarks  
 Through the experimental testing and the MS 
simulation of micropillars with inclined interfaces, 
the role played by the interfaces between the thin 
film metallic glass ZrCu layer and the 
nanocrystalline Zr layer has been demonstrated. The 
deformation and failure under micro-compression is 
basically governed by the interfacial strength. The 
current sharp interfaces in the sputtered ZrCu/Cu 
nanolaminate are considered to be sufficiently strong, 
For the horizontal 0o pillars, the elastic modulus and 
yield strength, based on experiment and simulation, 
are about 125 GPa and 1.9 GPa, respectively. For the 
inclined 45o pillars, the modulus (can be termed as 
shear modulus) and strength (can be termed as 
interfacial shear strength) are about 45 GPa and 1.3 
GPa, respectively. The extracted interfacial shear 
strength of 1.3 GPa can justify our conclusion that 
the current interface is sufficiently strong.  
 To further improve the multilayered 
amorphous/nanocrystalline nanolaminates, possibly 
applied in MEMS designs, the interface appears to be 
critical. Our parallel study on the graded interface 
[32] might offer an alternate solution. If the 
interfaces are further strengthened to a level 
exceeding the shear strength of the amorphous ZrCu 
and nanocrystalline Zr layers, then interface failure
