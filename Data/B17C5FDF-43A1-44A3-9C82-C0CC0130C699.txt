Introduction 
It is well-known that fiber-reinforced aluminum laminates (FRALL) have been successfully 
fabricated and commercialized. The hybrid laminates are based on thin sheets of aluminum alloy and 
plies of fiber-reinforced polymeric materials. They were initially developed in Netherlands, and 
showed promising fatigue properties [1]. Subsequently, aramid fiber-reinforced aluminum (ARALL) 
and glass fiber-reinforced aluminum (GLARE) were marketed with the enhancement of their 
mechanical properties [2]. Moreover, carbon fiber-reinforced aluminum laminates (CARALL) 
showed a superior crack propagation resistance under T-T fatigue [3]. All the above developed 
FRALLs contain epoxy-resin polymer, then the service temperature is not expected to exceed 373°K 
[4]. On the other hand, carbon fiber (CF) reinforced polyether ether ketone (PEEK) polymer 
composites (CF/PEEK) possess extraordinary specific strength and stiffness along the longitudinal 
direction, as compared with steel, Al or Ti alloys [5]. In AS-4/PEEK composite laminates, their 
superior capability to resist cyclic loadings [6-7] and to sustain original mechanical properties at 
elevated temperature were demonstrated [8-9]. Thus, AS-4/PEEK APC-2 composite laminates is one 
of the best candidates for aerospace applications. 
Nowadays, “lighter, thinner, stronger and cheaper” are the goals of materials science and 
engineering, especially in nanoscale age. However, our concern is focused on a small part of 
engineering application, i.e., adding nanoparticles on the interfaces in APC-2 composite laminates to 
make a significant improvement of mechanical properties due to static and cyclic loadings at elevated 
temperature. Hussain et al. [10-11] found the mechanical properties are highly increased in 
Carbon/Epoxy composites by adding Al2O3 particles. Practically, PEEK matrix mixed with nano 
carbon fibers of 15% by wt. can reach the optimal strength and stiffness [12]. Jen, et al. [8] found the 
significant improvements of mechanical properties in APC-2 laminates with the addition of 1 wt% of 
SiO2 nanoparticles. 
Although the fiber reinforced thermoplastic matrix composite materials have been developed 
very rapidly, their applications to structural elements and components are still immature due to the 
lack of sufficient empirical data. Nevertheless, in structural joining and connection of components, 
the notch cannot be avoided. Thus, the damage and propagation to failure initiated by stress 
concentration is a serious problem. Cowly and Beaumont [13] proposed the damage accumulation at 
notches and fracture stress of carbon-fiber/polymer composites under effects of stress and 
temperature. Bui et al. [14] combined strain-energy release rates and interlaminar stresses to forecast 
the imperfect interlaminar interfaces in laminated composites. Yokozeki et al. [15] investigated the 
damage accumulation behaviors in carbon fiber reinforced nanocomposite laminates under tensile 
loading. Gruber et al. [16] analyzed the stress concentration of fiber-reinforced multilayered 
composites with pin-loading holes. Hu et al. [17] investigated the interlaminar stresses in composite 
laminates with a circular hole. Morais [18] suggested a new approach to predict the open-hole tensile 
strength of quasi-isotropic laminates. 
The innovative Al/APC-2 nanocomposite laminates W/WO a circular hole were fabricated. 
Their mechanical properties subjected to static tensile at elevated temperatures were measured. The 
response of mechanical behavior was highlighted. 
Specimen Fabrication 
The prepregs of Carbon/PEEK (Cytec Industries Inc., USA) unidirectional plies were cut and 
stacked into cross-ply [0/90]s and quasi-isotropic [0/±45/90]s laminates. The nanoparticles SiO2 
(Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials, Inc. USA) possess the average diameter 15±5 nm, specific 
surface area 160±20 m2/g, spherical crystallographic and amorphous powder. The optimal amount of 
SiO2 was found 1% by wt. of laminate (3% by wt. of PEEK, Vf=61%) and spread uniformly on ten 
plies in laminates [8]. The 2024 (Al: 90.7-94.7%, Cu: 3.8-4.9%, Mn: 0.3-0.9%, Mg: 1.2-1.8%) 
aluminum alloy sheets were supplied by ThyssenKrupp Materials NA, Inc., USA. The thickness of 
  6
can be described that the notch effect is more sensitive than temperature to reduce ultimate strength of 
quasi-isotropic lay-ups.  
For cross-ply lay-ups, the ultimate loads of unnotched specimens change irregularly while the 
temperature rising. Also the trend of notch size 1mm and 0mm (unnotched) is very similar. Obviously, 
there is a serious drop of 25% from unnotched to notch size 1mm. However, for the quasi-isotropic 
lay-ups, the trends of notch size 2, 4 and 6mm are nearly horizontal. It can be explained that as the 
notch size under or equal to 1mm the temperature still affect the result significantly, and as notch size 
increasing over 1mm the temperature effect become unobvious and weak.  
To verify this work, previous study [20] has been listed in Table 3. The partial overlap has been 
selected for comparison from Tables 1-3, and then plot in Figs. 8 and 9. Fig. 8, shows the normalized 
ultimate loads of quasi-isotropic lay-ups at notch diameters 1, 2, and 4mm for APC-2 and hybrid 
Al/APC-2 laminates. Obviously, the curve of each hole size is very close and similar. It means the 
hybrid quasi-isotropic composite laminate was successfully manufactured and the resistance against 
notch is even better than APC-2 laminate. The drop of load of hybrid cross-ply laminate is slightly 
more than that of APC-2 laminate referred to Fig. 9, especially from 100 to 150°C. There is an 
opposite trend at 75°C that the hybrid cross-ply laminate goes downwards. It is reasonable since there 
is a peak value between 75°C and 100°C for unnotched hybrid cross-ply laminates, however, the 
temperature effect has been covered by notch effect in notched sample. 
Conclusion 
The Al/APC-2 hybrid cross-ply and quasi-isotropic nanocomposite laminates were fabricated. 
The concluding remarks were summarized as follows. 
● Base on the unnotched specimen, the ultimate loads of quasi-isotropic lay-ups go 
downwards and the ultimate loads of cross-ply lay-ups change irregularly as the 
temperature rising. 
● The ultimate loads have a notable decrease from unnotched to 1mm notch for both lay-ups. 
The ultimate loads of quasi-isotropic specimen drop 13% averagely, however, a double 
drop of 25% has been found in cross-ply lay-ups. 
● Based on the same hole size, the trend of all notched data has a slight decrease as the 
temperature rising. The notch effect over whelm the temperature effect in notched 
specimens. 
● The cross-ply specimens are more sensitive to notch effect than that of quasi-isotropic.
