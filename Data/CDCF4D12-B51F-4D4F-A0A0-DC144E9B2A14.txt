Abstract 
 
This proposal presents an automatic image 
segmentation based on the fast active contour 
model and storage system, which automaticlly 
segments the tumor from mammograms and based 
on the results, performs a progressive compression 
in the storage. This is performed in two subsystems 
called computerized tumor boundary segmentation 
subsystem and tumor region reserved compression 
subsystem. In the first subsystem, a threshold se-
lection method is used first to remove the back-
ground from the image, then the morphological 
operator is used to remove the noise, the initial 
contour estimation is the boundary of the extracted 
tumor. A modified algorithm based on the greedy 
algorithm for active contour modeling is also pre-
sented to approach tumor boundary. Finally, the 
test mammograms are segmented into tumor, breast 
without tumor and background. In the second sub-
system, Vector Quantization GHNN (Gray-based 
Competitive Hopfield Neural Network) is applied 
on the three regions with different compression 
rates according their importance factors so as to 
reserve important tumor features and simultane-
ously reduce the size of mammograms for storage 
efficiency. 
Keywords: Image Segmentation, mammograms,

1. Introduction  
 
Breast cancer is the most common form of 
cancer in women worldwide. According to the De-
partment of Health statistics [1], Taiwan women 
disease incidence rate, the breast cancer leapt to 
first, poses the quite big threat to the domestic 
women. In order to achieve the early diagnosis the 
goal, the X-ray Mammography is one of effective 
methods.  
Otsu’s adaptive threshold algorithm [2] has 
been applied widely in image processing. Park et al. 
[3] use the technique to separate white blood cells 
in bone marrow images. Automatic thresholding is 
an important technique in image segmentation. The 
method of automatic thresholding is to automati-
cally select an adequate gray-level threshold for 
extracting objects from there background. 
Over the past few decades, morphological op-
erators have gained increasing popularity in the 
implementation of signal and image processing 
systems. Morphological operators are often used to 
remove the noise from the image [3-5]. Many of 
the morphological algorithms discussed are based 
on two operations: dilation and erosion. The detail 
we will discuss in this paper. 
Boundary extraction is an important procedure 
not decisive to boundary detection since only a 
coarse boundary is needed at this period. The re-
sulting threshold image includes the tumor and 
some noisy structures. In order to remove the noise, 
a binary morphological erosion and dilation proc-
essing is used to the thresholded image while keep 
the tumor areas. 
First, erosion processing is used to remove the 
noise except the tumor. The eroded image is ob-
tained from 
 ( )SEAB Θ=                            (6) 
 
where B is the eroded image, A is input image, SE 
is a 33× -square structuring element. 
When a part of the tumor which has been re-
moved by the erosion. By the binary dilation proc-
essing can be restored. 
 ( )SEBC ⊕=                           (7) 
 
where C is the dilated image. 
The initial estimation can be extracted by the mor-
phological operations. 
 
 
4. Greedy Active Contour Model 
 
It is different from the previous snakes, the 
greedy algorithm is more stable and fast to ap-
proach edge from image. The energy is computed 
at a point iv  and each of its eight neighbors, as 
show in Figure 1. The energy-functional being 
minimized by this algorithm is 
 
( ) ( ) ( )( )dsEsEsEsE imgcurvcont∫ ++= γβα  (8)
 
The parametersα 、β andγ are use to balance the 
relative influence of the three terms. Their relative 
sizes, rather than absolute sizes, are significant [10]. 
The continuity term 
 
1−−−= iicont vvdE                       (9) 
 
where d  is the average distance between points. 
Thus points having distance near the average dis-
tance. The curvature term is

That is, ix∆  is denoted 1−− ii xx , and such like 
iy∆ . is∆  is the distance between points iv  and 
1−iv . When the value of curvature is larger than a 
threshold, it is denoted a corner.  
The image force 
 ( ) min)/(maxmin −−= magEimg             (11) 
 
where mag is the magnitude of iv ,  max and min 
are the maximum and minimum gradient in each 
neighborhood.

and each of its eight neighbors.

and 
IE ∇−=2                              (14) 
 
where 1E  is the continuity term, ix  and iy  are 
the x- and y-coordinates of the iv th contour point. 
It is acceptable to have points on the contour 
evenly spaced. 2E  is the image force, |▽I| is the 
gradient of the image I. The tumor is not a polygon, 
so we reject the curvature term. Then use the 
greedy search method to find the minimal position, 
like figure 1.   
 
4.2 Gradient Operator 
First-order derivative is defined as a digital 
image various approximations of the 2-D gradient. 
The gradient of an image f(x, y) at position (x, y) is 
defined as the vector 
 
function for the GHNN based on competitive 
learning can be modified as

where jy ,γ  is modified grey relational grade 
between training samples yx  and codevector

Using Eqs. (26) and (27), the Hopfield neural 
network based on competitive learning can be used 
for vector quantization in a parallel manner are 
given as follows. 
 
Step 1: Input a set training vector { }nxxxX ,,, 21 L= , 
and the number of class c. 
Step 2: Compute the grey relational grade matrix { } cn

1,1, === γR  with training samples and 
codevectors. 
Step 3: Set the initial number of the vectors to be n. 
Each class contains at least one vector.  
Step 4: Calculate the input to each neuron (x,i) by 
Eq. (27). 
Step 5: Apply below equation to update the neu-
rons’ output states for each neuron in a row.  { }

Step 6: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for all rows, and                        
count the number of neurons for the new 
state. If no neuron is changed go to step 7, 
otherwise go to step 4. 
Step 7: Complete the codebook design.

a reduced version of the original MIAS database so 
that every image is 1024 pixels× 1024 pixels.
