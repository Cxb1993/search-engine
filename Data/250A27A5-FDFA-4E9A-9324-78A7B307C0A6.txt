Recently, new emerging applications such as RFID and wireless sensor network , 
which consume v ery low power and utiliz e the energy harv ested f rom the env ironment, 
are gaining more attention. In these applications, the energy are collected f rom solar, 
v ib ration, heat or radioactiv e decay of  matters and at the same time the amount of  
energy av ailab le is limited and the source is unstab le.  
In some env ironment, such as the M E M S  power generator, the harv ested v oltage 
source may b e much lower. A t the same time in order to reduce the cost of  the dev ice, 
ex pensiv e v oltage regulator should b e av oided. U nstab le source poses new challenges 
in the design of  the power management circuit and computation paradigm f or the 
applications.  
M oreov er, the b attery charger is also considered f or the no dynamics env ironment. 
T he charger charge the b attery in the standb y period.  
In this work , we propose a power management system f or energy-limited source 
applications. W e propose a supply-side charge-b ased computation paradigm where 
computation is carried out only when the energy harv ested f rom the env ironment is 
enough to ex ecute a specif ied operation of  the computation.

T he output v oltage of  the M E M S  generator is a time-v ariab le v oltage. T he 
property of  this v oltage may b e an aperiodic or unreliab le v oltage. S o we must 
regulate this v oltage to ensure operating the f unctions of  the whole circuit. W e 
ex pect to utiliz e a low power consumption DC / DC  switching conv erter.

E x cept the main step-down conv erter circuit, we should tak e care of  the ultra 
high v oltage lev el unex pectedly. If  the v oltage is too high, it can draw out the 
current to press the v oltage. A nd it also charge the large capacitor to reduce the 
output ripple if  the input power is enough.

T ypically, we of ten use the linear regulator, such as low dropout regulator 
(L DO ) . H owev er, the drawb ack  of  this structure is the low transf er ef f iciency at 
the large drop v oltage b etween the output and supply v oltage. Presently currently 
applied switching regulator, the transf er ef f iciency will b e up to 90 % , and the large 
output load range.

at the transition b etween PW M  mode and PFM  mode. It is a matter of  
ef f iciency and current load range f or hyb rid-mode modulation techniq ue. T he 
hyb rid-mode modulation can maintain a high ef f iciency b y closing the two peak  
ef f iciency v alues to reduce the ef f iciency drop at the sacrif ice of  load range. 
T heref ore, a dithering sk ip modulator is proposed to raise the ef f iciency 
b etween PW M  and PFM  curv es in Figure 6. In other words, the ef f iciency drop 
b etween PW M  and PFM  modes can b e raised b y the nov el DS M  mode. 
B esides, a nov el load sensor is also proposed f or DS M  in order to dynamically 
switch among these three modes, which are PW M , PFM , and DS M  modes. 
Furthermore, compared with PS M  mode and b urst mode, DS M  mode uses the 
dithering techniq ue to reduce the output ripple. Due to the insertion of  DS M  
mode, a wide load range and high ef f iciency can b e achiev ed without sacrif icing 
the load range of  conv entional hyb rid mode. B esides, the improv ed result is 
ex pected as the smooth ef f iciency curv e f rom PW M  mode curv e to DS M  mode 
curv e and f urther ex tending to PFM  mode without increasing the output 
v oltage ripple.

In. Figure 9, a f ormal current sensing techniq ue called S E N S E FE T  
topology is proposed b y prior literature [ 8] . During the sensing period, the 
P-type power M O S FE T  is turned on b y setting signal S W _ P low and the 
sensing current Isense is eq ual to a thousandth of  inductor current IL . B y the 
sensing resistor Rsense, the sensing current can b e transf erred to sensing 
v oltage V sense. T hus, the peak  v alue of  sensing v oltage can stand f or the load 
condition of  the output. H owev er, ev en though V sense is direct proportional 
to the load current, it is dif f icult f or simple comparators to decide the switching 
points of  three controllers b ecause the v ariation of  V sense is too small.
