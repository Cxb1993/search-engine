Abstract 
The abnormal intra-QRS potentials (AIQPs) from a 
signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) have been 
proposed to indicate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 
This study developed a new method based on the 
prediction error filtering for the extraction of AIQPs. Two 
sequential SAECGs with the same noise level were used 
as desired and reference input signals to estimate the 
normal QRS and AIQPs. 
The simulation results showed that the prediction error 
filter can effectively decorrelate the AIQPs (simulated as 
an autoregressive stochastic process) from the normal 
QRS complex under an extremely poor signal-to-noise 
ratio. The AIQPs of VT patients were significantly greater 
than those of normal subjects in leads X and Y 
(p<0.05).This work demonstrated that the AIQPs 
extracted by the prediction error filter were useful for the 
evaluation of the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 
 
1. Introduction 
The ventricular late potentials (VLPs) recorded from 
signal averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) have been 
associated with a reentry substrate for ventricular 
arrhythmias [1,2]. Although VLPs were initiated from 
within the normal QRS interval, they are actually 
characterized by the signal portion that outlasts this 
interval. Time-domain SAECG parameters, including 
fQRSD, LAS40 and RMS40, have been widely employed 
to quantify VLPs. However, the major limitations of 
time-domain analysis are an incomplete characterization 
of reentrant activity [3] and the poor accuracy of positive 
prediction [4].  
The VLPs detection focuses on the evaluation of low-
amplitude and high-frequency components at the terminal 
QRS complex. However, certain part of VLPs can be 
distributed over entire QRS interval. These VLPs have 
the same high-frequency characteristics as the large-
amplitude QRS complex and its detection is relatively 
difficult. Moreover, an extremely poor signal-noise-ratio 
(SNR) (low-amplitude VLPs compared with large QRS 
wave) and the noise interference can limit the VLPs 
detection. 
In addition to VLPs, Gomis et al. [5] and Lander et al. 
[6] have proposed the abnormal intra-QRS potentials 
(AIQPs) as a new index to evaluate the risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias. Although the formal pathophysiological 
bases for AIQPs have not yet been well established, 
numerous investigations have suggested that the activity 
of a reentry substrate of ventricular arrhythmias may be 
completely contained within the normal duration of the 
QRS [7]. The analysis of the AIQPs allows a potential 
pathophysiological signal that is completely within the 
normal QRS interval to be measured.  
The AIQPs were assumed as the transient, 
unpredictable part of the QRS complex. Gomis et al. [5] 
developed an ARMA model built in the discrete cosine 
transform (DCT) domain to estimate the normal QRS 
components and analyze the AIQPs by the modeling 
residuals. In the DCT domain, most ECG energy is 
concentrated in the low-frequency band. This model can 
use a low order to estimate ECG signals accurately. 
However the current parametric modeling is in the 
discrete cosine transform domain (i.e. frequency domain) 
to estimate the AIQPs, hence the transient and 
unpredictable features in time domain may not be 
accurately extracted. The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the AIQPs directly in the time domain based on 
a prediction error filter.  
2. Methods 
2.1. High-resolution ECG recording 
There were 50 normal Taiwanese (N) and 30 sustained 
ventricular tachycardia (VT) patients were recruited in 
this study.  High-resolution ECGs were recorded using a 
commercially available Simens-Elema Megacart® 
machine with a bipolar, orthogonal X, Y and Z lead 
system. The high-resolution ECGs were recorded at rest 
in a supine position using a commercially available 
Simens-Elema Megacart® machine. A bipolar, orthogonal 
X, Y and Z lead system was used. A sample of 10 min 
raw ECG with 12-bit resolution at 2 kHz was stored on 
ISSN 0276−6547 457 Computers in Cardiology 2006;33:457−460.

2.4. Statistical analysis 
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation 
(SD). All statistical analyses were done with Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences® (SPSS). Normal 
distribution tests were performed on all quantitative 
variables [9]. Statistical significance was defined as p 
values less than 0.05. Comparisons between pairwise 
groups were performed using a Student t test for normally 
distributed continuous variables. Levene’s test was used 
to check the homogeneity of variance between variables. 
The Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests 
were used for those non-normally distributed [10].

A simulation experiment was performed to determine 
whether the prediction error filtering could extract the 
transient and unpredictable AIQPs. Figure 1(a) shows two 
successive SAECG without AIQPs. Their normal QRS 
parts with a peak-to-peak range about 1200 µV are highly 
correlated ( )1(1.0)()( 221 −×−= nsnsns ). The optimal 
filtering output and error are shown in Figure 1(b). This 
study selected a 20th-order filter for analyzing the AIQPs 
of all SAECGs. Because of the absence of the AIQPs, the 
normal QRS )(1 ns  can be exactly estimated and no 
AIQPs presented in the filtering error.  
Figure 2(a) shows two successive SAECG with AIQPs. 
Their normal QRS parts are same as those in Figure 1(a). 
An autoregressive stochastic process was used to simuate 
the AIQPs as follow.

computer hard disk for subsequent analysis. The time-
domain SAECG analysis under various RMS noise levels 
was performed offline. 
2.2. Signal averaging 
Offline signal averaging procedure in our program 
followed the standards of 1991 ESC, AHA and ACC 
Task Force [2]. Each incoming heartbeat was aligned 
with the template waveform. An alignment was accepted 
when the correlation coefficient is larger than 0.98. The 
template was then updated every eight beats averaged to 
prevent any possible corruption from proliferation. Each 
averaged ECG of lead X, Y and Z was filtered with a 
four-pole 40-250 Hz high-pass Butterworth filter working 
with the bi-directional mode. The filtered signal-averaged 
vector magnitude (VM), which is defined as the filtered 
QRS complex, was calculated as the square root of 
( 222 ZYX ++ ).  
A 40 ms section where the root-mean-square voltage 
was minimum in the ST segment of the VM was selected 
as the noise sample for the evaluation of the noise level. 
The onset and offset of SAECG were defined as the 
midpoint of the 5-ms segment in which the mean voltage 
exceeded the mean noise level plus three times the 
standard deviation of the noise sample. 
The final noise level of SAECG was set at 0.7 µV. 
Two successive SAECGs with the same noise level were 
performed for the follow-up prediction error filtering. 
2.3. Prediction error filtering 
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the prediction 
error filtering for the evaluation of the AIQPs.  The delay 
time T represents the time of one cardiac cycle. The 
design of a finite-impulse-response Wiener filter, )(zW , 
is to produce the minimum mean-square estimate of the 
desired input )(nd  by filtering a set of observations of a 
statistically related reference input )(nx .  
This study introduced two successive SAECGs to be 
desired and reference input signals respectively.  Each 
SAECG was assumed to contain two main parts – (1) the 
normal QRS, )(nS i , and (2) the AIQPs, )(nvi , 2,1=i . 
The normal QRS are assumed to be uncorrelated with the 
AIQPs. Two successive AIQPs are also assumed to be 
uncorrelated with each other. Because two successive 
normal QRS are highly correlated, we can try to use the 
wiener filter with a low order to separate the normal QRS 
and the AIQPs in the desired input SAECG. 
The normal QRS can be estimated by the output of the 
pth-order filter. That is,

4. Discussion and conclusions 
This study proposed a new method based on the 
prediction error filtering to evaluate the AIQPs. Two 
successive SAECGs were adopted as the inputs of the 
prediction error filters. Because two successive normal 
QRS were highly correlated, the normal QRS can be 
estimated from the filtering output and then the filtering 
error can used to estimate the AIQPs. The simulation 
results also showed the performance of the proposed 
prediction error filter with and without the presence of the 
AIQPs.  
This work demonstrated the AIQPs extracted from the 
prediction error filtering are useful for the evaluation of 
the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. However, the 
extracted AIQPs from the filtering error still included 
certain interferences. This may affect the clinically 
diagnostic performance.

1. Introduction 
The ventricular late potentials (VLPs) recorded from 
signal averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) have been 
associated with a reentry substrate for ventricular 
arrhythmias [1,2]. Although VLPs were initiated from 
within the normal QRS interval, they are actually 
characterized by the signal portion that outlasts this 
interval. Time-domain SAECG parameters, including 
fQRSD, LAS40 and RMS40, have been widely employed 
to quantify VLPs. However, the major limitations of 
time-domain analysis are an incomplete characterization 
of reentrant activity [3] and the poor accuracy of positive 
prediction [4].  
The VLPs detection focuses on the evaluation of low-
amplitude and high-frequency components at the terminal 
QRS complex. However, certain part of VLPs can be 
distributed over entire QRS interval. These VLPs have 
the same high-frequency characteristics as the large-
amplitude QRS complex and its detection is relatively 
difficult. Moreover, an extremely poor signal-noise-ratio 
(SNR) (low-amplitude VLPs compared with large QRS 
wave) and the noise interference can limit the VLPs 
detection. 
In addition to VLPs, Gomis et al. [5] and Lander et al. 
[6] have proposed the abnormal intra-QRS potentials 
(AIQPs) as a new index to evaluate the risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias. Although the formal pathophysiological 
bases for AIQPs have not yet been well established, 
numerous investigations have suggested that the activity 
of a reentry substrate of ventricular arrhythmias may be 
completely contained within the normal duration of the 
QRS [7]. The analysis of the AIQPs allows a potential 
pathophysiological signal that is completely within the 
normal QRS interval to be measured.  
The AIQPs were assumed as the transient, 
unpredictable part of the QRS complex. Gomis et al. [5] 
developed an ARMA model built in the discrete cosine

components and analyze the AIQPs by the modeling 
residuals. In the DCT domain, most ECG energy is 
concentrated in the low-frequency band. This model can 
use a low order to estimate ECG signals accurately. 
However the current parametric modeling is in the

to estimate the AIQPs, hence the transient and 
unpredictable features in time domain may not be 
accurately extracted. The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the AIQPs directly in the time domain based on

in a supine position using a commercially available 
Simens-Elema Megacart® machine. A bipolar, orthogonal 
X, Y and Z lead system was used. A sample of 10 min 
raw ECG with 12-bit resolution at 2 kHz was stored on

represents AIQPs in lead l, l=X, Y or Z).  
2.4. Statistical analysis 
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation 
(SD). All statistical analyses were done with Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences® (SPSS). Normal 
distribution tests were performed on all quantitative 
variables [9]. Statistical significance was defined as p 
values less than 0.05. Comparisons between pairwise 
groups were performed using a Student t test for normally 
distributed continuous variables. Levene’s test was used 
to check the homogeneity of variance between variables. 
The Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests 
were used for those non-normally distributed [10].

and reference inputs, and (b) the filtering output and error. 
The dotted lines are the original normal QRS ( )(1 ns ) in 
the plot of )(ny , and the original AIQPs ( )(1 nv ) in the 
plot of )(ne  separately. 
 
A simulation experiment was performed to determine 
whether the prediction error filtering could extract the 
transient and unpredictable AIQPs. Figure 1(a) shows two 
successive SAECG without AIQPs. Their normal QRS 
parts with a peak-to-peak range about 1200 µV are highly 
correlated ( )1(1.0)()( 221 −×−= nsnsns ). The optimal 
filtering output and error are shown in Figure 1(b). This 
study selected a 20th-order filter for analyzing the AIQPs 
of all SAECGs. Because of the absence of the AIQPs, the 
normal QRS )(1 ns  can be exactly estimated and no 
AIQPs presented in the filtering error.  
Figure 2(a) shows two successive SAECG with AIQPs. 
Their normal QRS parts are same as those in Figure 1(a). 
An autoregressive stochastic process was used to simuate 
the AIQPs as follow.
