important issue for enhancing the success rate of an 
innovative R&D project.   
One solution approach, such as concurrent 
engineering (Prasad 1996) and quality function 
deployment (Hauser and Clausing 1988), is to collect 
more information to minimize R&D uncertainty for 
making better decisions.  However, it is hard to 
anticipate the life cycle impacts of &D decisions at the 
early R&D phase.  Furthermore, it may be possible 
to spend precious time and cost to perform early 
analysis and problem solving for life cycle impacts of 
R&D decisions at early R&D phase, but the decisions 
made may become inappropriate because of highly 
dynamics of technology and market.  Worst still, if 
the planned time-to-market goal cannot be achieved, 
the market opportunity may be lost because of sheer 
competition.   
Another approach is to adopt managerial flexibility 
in the R&D process (Verganti 1999).  For example, 
we may delay technology selection decisions to 
downstream phases where the feasibilities of 
candidate technologies have become clear.  Flexible 
product development may be considered as the ability 
to bring new products to market with a minimum of 
disruption when markets, customers, technologies, or 
management direction changes rapidly.  The less the 
disruption, and the later the change can occur, the 
greater is the flexibility.  As technology and market 
has become more dynamic for hi-tech industries, 
flexible product development offers a fresh alternative.  
It recognizes that uncertainty is the essential core of 
innovation, and rather than trying to fight it or ignore 
it, managers should learn how to embrace change and 
enhance their flexibility.  However, flexible product 
development may be useful for creating innovative 
products by better reacting high technology and 
market uncertainty, but it may increase development 
costs.  Therefore, the management challenge is how 
to properly plan flexible development process for 
innovative R&D projects and analyze the value of 
development flexibility for maximizing the potential 
market payoffs.  
This paper proposes a real-option-based 
methodology to plan and analyze development 
flexibility for innovative R&D projects that usually 
have great technology and market uncertainty.  Since 
development flexibility is not inherent in an R&D 
project, the proposed methodology identifies potential 
risks, recognizes a set of development options to 
resolve the risks, and then applies a real option model 
to evaluate and select the options that maximize the 
value of R&D projects.  The proposed methodology 
can help R&D mangers improve the development 
flexibility of an R&D project.  A drug development 
project is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. 
In the following, section 3 roughly introduces the 
proposed methodology and section 4 summarizes the 
results obtained from this project.  For the literature, 
complete methodology and computational 
experiments, please refer to Wang (2008) for details. 
 
 
三、方法論 
 
Since management flexibility is not inherent in an 
R&D project, it has to be plan in advance at the early 
R&D stage.  This paper develops a flexibility 
planning procedure that proactively identifies 
potential high risk problems that may occur during 
R&D and determines appropriate management actions 
in advance to increase development flexibility of an 
R&D project.  The management actions can be 
adopted in response to new information for enhancing 
the investment opportunity's value by improving its 
upside potential while limiting downside losses 
relative to the initial expectation.  This will increase 
potential value and success rate of an R&D project.  
The concept of development flexibility can be 
modeled by the real options theory which can provide 
a quantitative approach to determine the value of 
development flexibility.   
The flexibility planning procedure for the high risk 
R&D project is divided into three steps: (1) 
identifying critical risks, (2) recognizing cascading 
options structure, and (3) evaluate project flexibility.  
The proposed approach is adapted from Benaroch 
(2001) in which an IT investment project was studied 
and the log-transformed binominal method was used 
to evaluate the options selected.  Instead of using the 
log-transformed binominal method, the real options 
approach proposed by Huchzermeier and Loch (2001) 
is used to evaluate flexibility in R&D, because it can 
not only characterize market uncertainty, but also 
represent R&D operational uncertainty including 
budget, product performance, and market performance 
requirement.  In addition, this research applies a 
simple risk assessment method to identify critical risks 
that may be crucial to influence the success rate of 
product launch.   
The real options model is described as follows.  
Assume that there are T review stages: t = 0, 1, 2, ..., T 
− 1, and the new product is launched to the market at 
stage T.  R&D uncertainty can be represented by 
performance improvement and deterioration spread 
over possible performance states.  The state of the 
project at review stage t is characterized by the 
expected product performance X = (x1, x2, …, xn), 
where xk is the individual product performance, k = 
1, .., n.  Let d be the management decision (e.g., 
continuation, abandonment, etc.) at stage t.  It is 
assumed that whenever the system is in state Xi and 
decision d is made at stage t, the system moves to a 
new state Xj with transition probability )(dptij .     
For the development costs, an initial investment of 
I must be made to start the project.  In addition, a 
cost c(dt) is incurred, if the management decision dt is 
selected at stage t.  When the project is launched at 
stage T with a performance state X, it will generate an 
expected market payoff Π(X) in the form of S-curve: 
Π(X) = m + F(X)(M – m), 
where F(X) = P(D ≤ X) represents the probability that

Since some of the parameters are difficult to be 
estimated accurately, sensitivity analysis was 
performed to examine the solution quality and study 
the impact of uncertainty on the value of flexibility.  
In Figure 2, the project value with flexibility has 
higher increasing rate comparing to the NPV project 
value, as the market share increases.  This is because 
as the market share increases, using flexibility strategy 
will evaluate and select the most profitable options at 
each decision gate in order to maximize market 
payoff.   
Next we examine market requirements variability on 
the option value.
