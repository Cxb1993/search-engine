四、研究方法與成果: 
各子計畫第三年度研究成果的摘要如下： 
子計畫一： 
 機會式中繼已被提出為適用於感知及協同無線網狀網路、具有卓越效能的新興技術。由於高頻譜
使用效率的需求，共頻道干擾成為無線網狀網路中眾多效能衰減的原因之一。本報告的目標為探討共
頻道干擾對於解碼前送機會式中繼技術的影響，所考慮的通道環境為獨立、非必然相同分佈之瑞雷衰
減通道。此篇報告考慮基於訊雜比的選取準則且接收端實施最大比率合成技術，此架構特別適用於感
知及協同無線網狀網路下無法完美追蹤瞬時干擾通道資訊的環境。吾人提供此架構下的失效率數學表
示式，並且進一步探討此架構的漸進行為。本報告也分析機會式中繼技術在使用基於訊號干擾雜訊比
之選取準則下的漸進行為，並進一步比較以上兩種選取準則。最後，吾人透過蒙地卡羅模擬來驗證此
篇報告的理論分析。模擬的結果為相較於位於接受端的干擾，機會式中繼技術比較容易受到位於中繼
端的干擾影響。另外，當中繼的數目越多，訊號干擾雜訊比式選取準則所能提供的效能增益越多。 
 
子計畫二： 
本計畫之主要目的是針對無線感知式協同型網狀網路，建構出適用於此種網路拓樸之通訊系統架
構。本計畫在此整合型計畫中之任務為基頻訊號處理、基頻演算法則及收發器架構設計以及實際硬體

可程式邏輯閘陣列(Field-programmable gate array, FPGA)驗證。 
 
子計畫三： 
    下一代的無線網路勢必會整合多樣服務項目與應用方式。為適應此需求，以及維持完全覆蓋的無
線上網，用戶的通訊裝置將會變得無比聰明，具有感測周遭環境，並且在需要的時候取得可用的無線
網路資源。本計畫探討此類動態無線網路的分散式編碼，主要目的是要在不使用多天線的狀況下，也
能藉由用戶間的合作傳輸來得到空間多重增益。在計畫的第三年，我們將重心放在分散式編碼，以便
讓通訊端點之間可以合作。從資訊匯流的角度來看，我們發現這個問題的中心議題是一個 Wyner-Ziv
編碼(WZC)問題，也就是只有接收端能得知額外資訊（Side Information），而個別傳送端並不知此額外
資訊，但卻能彼此以最低傳輸速率壓縮資訊，並互相幫助的資訊壓縮問題。雖說這個問題已經有一些
存在數十年的理論，文獻上並無能達到理論極限的實際編碼解碼設計。本計畫提出並實現一個嶄新的
WZC 結構。模擬結果顯示這個實際可行的編碼解碼結構能達到 Wyner-Ziv 極限。比起之前其他研究結
果，我們提出的編碼解碼結構同時能提供更多的設計上的彈性。 
 
子計畫四： 
    本計畫旨在開發無線感知式協同型網狀網路(C2Mesh)之網路通信協定，包括媒體存取層、網路層
及應用層之通信協定及跨層最佳化。本年度研究方向特別針對應用層服務的特殊性，不再以傳統媒體
存取及網路層的效能指標(如網路容量及延遲)作為設計通信協定之依據，而是考慮到感知節點所傳送的
資料對應用層的有用性(如資料之重要性及彼此之相關程度)，以期在 C2Mesh 網路效能受限之情況下，
仍能從應用層服務之角度提供最佳之品質。首先，本計畫建立感知節點通信資料之相關性以及有用性
資訊模型；其次，本計畫根據資訊模型設計感知網路之傳輸節點選擇以及無線資源分配通信協定，以
期在網路資源不足、無法讓所有感知節點進行通信的情況下，能根據各感知節點資料對應用層的重要
性，選擇最佳之傳輸節點，並經由合作式轉送，將資料回送。透過電腦模擬的驗證，本計畫所提出之
媒體存取層、網路層以及應用層之通信協定與跨層最佳化技術，確能克服無線感知式協同型網狀網路
的先天限制，達到最佳化應用服務品質之目的。 
 
ineligible design. Similarly, we also use the sum(|S11|dB,j) for the 
two center frequencies and for the uniformly sampled 
frequencies within the two bands. The optimized results shown 
in Fig. 2 indicate that no matter how the frequency points are 
sampled, none of them meets the specification because one 
exceedingly superior |S11|j,dB may nullify all the other inferior 
values, misguiding the algorithm to explore locally within an 
improper solution sub-domain. Therefore, these conventional 
objective functions fail to find a satisfactory design. 
B. General Rules for Objective Functions 
The efficacy of these objective functions can be understood 
by their own functional behavior. The objective functions can 
be classified into two categories: the sum of the polynomial 
function of |S11|, namely Σ|S11|jk, and the sum of the logarithmic 
function of |S11|, namely Σ(logk|S11|)j. The former (latter) puts 
more emphasis on the inferior (superior) |S11|j as k increases. 
For an extremely large k, the former (letter) objection function 
would be dominated by those worse (better) performances, so it 
would perform as minimizing the maximum (minimum) value 
of |S11|j. This can be verified by optimizing the pixelized 
antenna within the 700–960 MHz band sampled at a 20-MHz 
interval. For Σ|S11|jk, the optimized results are shown in Fig. 3(a) 
and indicates that a larger k leads to a wider bandwidth but a 
poorer matching. In the extreme case of k, the optimized result 
would converge to that obtained via the max(|S11|j). On the 
other hand, for Σ(logk|S11|)j, the optimized results are shown in 
Fig. 3(b), which reveals that the larger the k value, the narrower 
the bandwidth but with a better matching. In the extreme case 
of k, the optimized result would converge to that obtained via 
the min(|S11|j). 
III. A NOVEL MULTIOBJECTIVE-BASED METHOD FOR 
WIDE- AND MULTI- BAND ANTENNA DESIGN 
To overcome the tradeoff between bandwidth and 
impedance matching, we propose a multiobjective method 
based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II 
(NSGA-II) [4]. Each objective (Fi) consists of a function  of 
|S11| at the sample frequencies within each band, and these 
objectives are manipulated to form an overall performance 
measure. The purpose of each objective is to ensure a good 
impedance matching, and therefore, we set Fi = Σ(logk|S11|)j 
with k = 8. The further manipulation of these objectives aims to 
ensure satisfactory bandwidths in the desired bands, so we 
chose max(Fi), the extreme case of Σ|S11|jk, as the overall 
performance measure. In the above design example, we chose 4 
objectives for the two operating bands. The objectives lay 
stress on all the band edges. The optimized results are plotted 
in Fig. 4. Clearly, the antenna structure found by the proposed 
approach outperforms those shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, 
following the same procedure, we perform a second-stage 
optimization on the junctions and edges of the pixelized 
antenna found by the initial optimization procedure. In this way, 
a more preferable performance can be found, which is also 
depicted in Fig. 4. This best design located by the two-stage 
optimization procedure is also verified experimentally. The 
associated reflection coefficient responses verify the efficacy of 
the proposed method and the novel objective function.

can achieve much lower envelope correlation. However, 
mutual coupling increases the envelope correlation because the 
power coupled to nearby antennas would also be re-radiated 
resulting in pattern distortion and an increased cross 
polarization. Pattern distortion and higher cross polarization in 
turn degrade the pattern and polarization diversity and thus 
increase the envelope correlation. In this paper, two 
configurations of antenna pair with polarization and pattern 
diversity are proposed to re-examine (1) and (2) and to 
investigate the increase in envelope correlation due to mutual 
coupling. 
III. CONFIGURATIONS OF THE ANTENNA PAIR 
For perpendicularly placed electrical and magnetic dipoles, 
the envelope correlation calculated via (1) and the associated 
analytical radiation patterns is zero. In this paper, we use a 
zeroth-order resonator (ZOR) antenna formed by the inductor-
loaded microstrip line (MSL) [3] to form a an electrically small 
magnetic loop on the XY-plane, which can then be viewed as a 
z-directed short electric dipole. The design of such an antenna 
was presented in [4]. Also, the half-wavelength slot antenna 
etched on the ground plane and fed by a MSL can be regarded 
as an x-directed magnetic dipole lying on the XY-plane. 
Two possible configurations of the antenna pair, consisting 
of a ZOR antenna and one of the x-directed slots, are shown in 
Fig. 1, and they are denoted as Configurations I and II. The 
center-to-center spacing between the slot and the ZOR antenna 
(D) is equal in both configurations. The envelope correlations 
calculated via (1) for these two configurations should be the 
same when neglecting the mutual coupling. However, the 
mutual coupling in configuration I is much larger than that in 
configuration II because, in configuration I, the magnetic 
current on the slot is parallel to the nearest edge (equivalent 
magnetic current) of the ZOR structure and, in this way, power 
can easily be coupled in between. The mutual coupling for 
configurations I and II, simulated by Ansoft HFSS 11.1, are -8 
dB and -23 dB, respectively. 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Both configurations are designed at 2.5 GHz on the Rogers 
Duroid 5880 substrate (εr = 2.2, tanδ = 0.0009) with thickness 
of 62 mil. The simulated radiation patterns of the antenna 
elements in configurations I and II are shown in Fig. 2. 
Although the envelope correlations calculated by (2) for 
configurations I and II are relatively small (3×10-3 and 5×10-5, 
respectively), those calculated via (1) are 0.02 and 1.5×10-4, 
respectively. We can see that for configuration I the values 
obtained via (1) and (2) differ significantly. Since mutual 
coupling may cause additional cross-polarized radiation, the 
larger cross polarization (Eθ) in XZ plane of the slot antenna  in 
configuration I increases the envelope correlation calculated by 
(1). As for configuration II, the larger cross polarization (Eφ) in 
YZ plane of the slot antenna increases the envelope correlation 
only slightly because the pattern diversity is still maintained 
between the two antennas. Moreover, the measured and 
simulated results for the antenna pair of configuration II are 
shown in Fig. 3, and they are in good agreement. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The envelope correlation of closely spaced antenna pair 
with polarization and pattern diversity is significantly increased 
due to the mutual coupling via increasing cross polarization. 
Compared to the formula of envelope correlation obtained via 
integration of radiation patterns, the envelope correlation 
calculated from S-parameters is time-saving but not accurate 
enough when a larger mutual coupling and cross polarization 
due to the coupled power exist. Consequently, validation of the 
envelope correlation by pattern integration is a must at the last 
stage of designing a closely spaced antenna pair.

respectively. Clearly, these antennas behave more like a non-
radiating resonator instead of a radiator. To achieve higher 
radiation efficiency, the indispensable carrier board is excited 
via coupling so that it becomes a dipole-like radiator. Although 
a similar concept has been investigated in [2], the main 
difference is that, in this work, the bottom copper plane of the 
carrier board is isolated from RF signals and is not the RF 
reference ground in these designs. Because the carrier board is 
in close proximity to the on-package antenna, it would be 
excited and function as a dipole-like radiator via a proper 
coupling from the on-package antenna. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 2 illustrates the current distributions of the proposed 
on-package loop and slot antennas. Obviously, the current 
distribution on the carrier board shown in Fig. 2(a) is similar to 
a fat half-wavelength dipole. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the y-
directed current vectors on the two arms of the loop are in the 
same direction, and they can effectively induce the y-directed 
half-wavelength resonant currents on the carrier board as 
shown in Fig. 2(b). As a result, the radiation efficiency of the 
on-package loop antenna above the carrier board is increased 
dramatically from 4% to 45%. On the contrary, the y-directed 
current vectors on the two halves of the slot antenna are in the 
opposite directions as shown in Fig. 2(f), and therefore, the self 
resonance of the carrier board can no longer be excited. The 
radiation efficiency of the on-package slot antenna above the 
carrier board is still 3%. 
Fig. 3 depicts the simulated |S11| of the proposed on-
package antennas. The impedance bandwidth (|S11| < -10 dB) 
of the on-package loop antenna with the carrier board, which is 
80 MHz (2.40-2.48 GHz), is larger than that of the case without 
(50 MHz, 2.46-2.51GHz) because of the effective excitation of 
the self resonance of the carrier board [2]. Fig. 4 displays the 
simulated radiation patterns of the proposed antennas with the 
carrier board. Obviously, the loop design exhibits a dipole-like 
pattern owing to the radiation of the carrier board, and the peak 
gain is -1.22 dBi. On the contrary, for the slot antenna, the 
radiation pattern is more complex, and the gain is much lower 
since the self resonance of the carrier board is not excited in 
this case. Importantly, although only two cases are considered 
here, similar conclusions could still be drawn for other antenna 
structures as designing on-package antennas. The radiation 
efficiency can be significantly increased by properly exciting 
the self resonance of the carrier board.
