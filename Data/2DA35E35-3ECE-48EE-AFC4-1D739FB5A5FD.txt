Introduction 
Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a special ad hoc network formed by networking these tiny 
devices within a certain area without any infrastructure [1], [2]. In recent years, WSNs have 
received considerable attention due to their promising applications in various areas. The energy 
constraints of WSNs are very strict [3]. Hence, increasing overhead for enhanced synchronization 
is not an effective solution. To overcome these challenges, one way is to reduce the amount of 
energy expended during clock synchronization via novel designs.  
  The conventional flooding time synchronization protocol (FTSP) [4] requiring only one-way 
messages from a sender, without needing other message exchanges between receivers or other 
senders, is modified to achieve the goal. A novel low-complexity approach, which is suitable for 
the modified FTSP, is then presented. The maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of clock 
parameters is also obtained. With the proposed scheme, the clock skew and off-set estimation 
problem is transformed into a problem independent of random delay and propagation delay. The 
aim of the proposed strategy is to reduce the amount of energy expended for both communication 
and computation while achieving good performance.  
  When using the proposed method, the characteristics of the FTSP, such as scalability and 
low-bandwidth requirement, are preserved, while the needed complexity of the proposed method 
is greatly reduced. Hence, more power can be saved than that saved in previous work.

sensor node runs at a frequency of ( )1 ε+ , at time T1,i, the anchor node sends the i-th Sync 
message to the sensor node, which contains the value of T1,i. When receiving the i-th Sync 
message at the sensor node, the clock skew produces a time difference of ( )1,i iT d Xε + + . 
Therefore, the sensor node receives this message at time ( )( )2, 1,1i i iT T d Xε θ= + + + + .

The proposed scheme makes more equations than before available to evaluate multiple 
unknown parameters with only one-way time transfer. To determine the clock skew and offset via 
a Sync message, receiving the i-th Type-0 Sync message yields 
 ( )( )2, 1, 1,1i i i iT T d Xε θ φ= + + + + +  ( 1 ) 
and 
 ( )( )2, 1, 1,2 1i i i iT T d Xε θ φ′ = + + + + +  ( 2 ) 
where 1,iφ  is a random jitter of sensor clocks 1 and 2 when receiving the i-th Type-0 Sync 
message. The random jitter 1,iφ  is assumed to be an independent Gaussian random variable (RV) 
with zero mean and variance 2σ . Due to the synchronous design, sensor clocks 1 and 2 have the 
same clock jitter. Likewise, when receiving the i-th Type-1 Sync message 
 ( )( )2, 1, 1,1i i i i iT T d Xε ξ θ φ′′ ′= + + + + + +  ( 3 ) 
and 
 ( )( )2, 1, 1,2 1i i i i iT T d Xε ξ θ φ′′′ ′= + + + + + +  ( 4 ) 
where 1,iφ′  is a random jitter with zero mean and variance 2σ  of sensor clocks 1 and 2 when 
receiving the i-th Type-1 Sync message. 
Now, with (1)–(4), the ML estimation of clock parameters can be obtained. To determine the 
clock skew without disturbance of the fixed propagation delay and the random access delay from 
the anchor node, subtracting (1) from (3) yields 
 ( )2, 2, 1, 1,1i i i i iT T ε ξ φ φ′′ ′− = + + −  ( 5 )

fixed delay after successfully sending Type-0 packet, then iξ  could be a constant. Thus, the 
information of iξ  in Type-1 packets could be omitted or not transmitted; otherwise, iξ  should 
be informed to sensor nodes because the exact transmission time of Type-1 packet is not known 
before its successful transmission. 
The obtainable resolution of the clock skew estimate depends on the length of the delay, i.e., 
iξ . We assume clock 2 nominal frequency is 25 MHz. To derive a clock skew resolution as low as 
1 ppm, the intended delay should not be too small because 25 MHz 1 ppm 25 Hz× =  which imposes 
the constraint that iξ  must be ≥  40 ms.

Fig 7  MSE of the estimated clock skew and clock offset of the proposed method as a function

Figure 7(a) and (b) respectively plot the MSE of the estimated clock skew and clock offset as a 
function of N under a typical clock skew of 40 ppm. The proposed ML estimators of clock skew 
and clock offset approach the CRLB (13) and (14) as N increases. The second moment 2,M ξ  of 
iξ  in (13) can be found to be proportional to the second moment of a geometric RV, which is

  This work demonstrates that the proposed method performs well in practical conditions. The 
improvement is due to the accurate evaluation of parameters, clock skew and offset, which 
enables correction of sensor clocks during the Sync interval. In summary, the advantages of the 
proposed method are as follows: 1) applicability in energy-constrained WSNs due to the necessity 
of only one-way messages; 2) low complexity requiring only simple operations and hardware; 3) 
scalability for large sensor networks; and 4) ability to obtain a precise sensor clock by the 
proposed scheme. Another advantage is that the proposed method is not impacted by the 
asymmetrical ratio (defined by total delay from the forward direction to the reverse direction) 
because of the employed one-way messages.
