2I. INTRODUCTION
Microstrip patch antennas are attractive for present wireless communication systems due
to the advantages of low profile, lightweight, and easily integrating with circuit devices. In
addition, the inherently linearly-polarized (LP) microstrip antenna also can be easily designed
to produce circular polarization (CP) radiation by introducing additional perturbation segments
[1]. Recently, the design of the microstrip antenna with switchable polarization [2]-[9] has
received much attention because it is useful for some specific applications in the wireless
communication systems, such as multi-system operation, frequency reuse, and reducing
multipath fading loss. Most of the related designs use varactor diodes or PIN diodes to control
the electric characteristics of the perturbation segments through a dc-bias network applied to
the diodes. For these designs, two problems are often encountered. One is that a complex
dc-bias network is required to provide an independent bias to each diode, and the different
biases have to be separated by some mechanisms, such as using capacitors [4], adding
insulating layers [5], and etching thin slits on the ground plane [6]-[8]. The problem would be
solved by reducing the number of the used diodes. The other problem is that it is difficult to
simultaneously achieve the impedance matching for different polarizations, especially for the
case of switching between LP and CP [5], [7]. That is because two degenerated orthogonal
modes have to be excited to produce CP radiation, and the resultant input impedance is
different from that of one resonant mode in the LP microstrip antenna. The problem can be
solved by the method of exciting two linear modes in phase as shown in [9]; however, the used
microstrip antenna is fed by a coplanar microstrip line, which is only suitable for the thin
substrate case. It would result in a limited operating bandwidth.
. In this paper, a novel design of the switchable polarization microstrip antenna (SPMA)
between CP and LP is proposed. The design concept is based on the ring-slot-coupled CP
microstrip antenna discussed in [10], [11] whose axial ratio can be varied by adjusting the
length of the series open-circuited stub in the microstrip feed line. Moreover, the slot-coupled
microstrip antenna can be applied to the case of using thick substrate, and consequently it can
provide more operating bandwidth than those of the reported SPMA designs. The effects of the
lengths of the open- and short-circuited stubs on the antenna performances are first investigated,
4radius of 0.6 mm is placed at the end of the stub, as shown in Fig. 1. The stub length is initially
set to 100 mm and then gradually shortened by cutting. Several antenna prototypes with
various stub lengths are selected to perform detailed measurements. It is found that, for each
tested antenna prototype, its minimum axial ratio, which is measured at broadside, is occurred
around 2520 MHz. The variation of the axial ratio at 2520 MHz against the stub length is
shown in Fig. 2, in whichλe (~ 70 mm) is the guided wavelength referred to 2520 MHz. The
measured and simulated results are shown together for comparisons, and satisfactory
agreement is observed. It is noted that the simulated results are performed by IE3D software
[12] that is based on the Method of Moment. From the experimental results, it is clearly seen
that the axial ratio of the ring-slot-coupled microstrip antenna measured at 2520 MHz is varied
between 0.4 and 23 dB with altering the stub length, which means the antenna can be operated
at a LP or CP mode by selecting a proper ls. For example, the antenna (prototype C) is CP with
the axial ratio of 0.5 dB when the length of the open-circuited stub is 0.69λe. On the contrary,
when the length of the open-circuited stub is 0.49λe, the antenna (prototype B) is LP because
its axial ratio, here can be considered as cross polarization level, is as high as 23 dB. The
phenomena can be illustrated by the current distributions on the microstrip feed line. Figs. 3 (a)
and (b) plot the simulated current distributions at 2520 MHz for the cases of ls = 0.49 and 0.69
λe, respectively. It can be observed that the x-directed current underneath the ring slot is little
when ls is 0.49λe, and consequently only the y-directional polarization can be excited.
However, when ls is 0.69λe, both the x- and y-directional polarizations can be excited to
achieve the CP operation. This also results in the periodic variation of the axial ratio against ls
and with the interval of about 0.5 guided wavelength between two adjacent lower or higher
axial ratios. For the case of using short-circuited stub, similar results are also observed and the
ls with a lower axial ratio (prototypes G or I) is approximately corresponding to that with
higher axial ratio (prototypes B or D) in the open-circuited stub case, and vice versa.
IV. THE PERFORMANCES OF THE CP AND LPANTENNAS
The input impedance of the ring-slot-coupled microstrip antenna is also measured when
the stub length is varied. This is important information to design the SPMA. The prototypes A,
6together with the simulated results. It is noted that the electric characteristics of the PIN diode
are included in the simulations. From the experimental results, the impedance bandwidths for
the LP and CP modes are 9 and 23 %, and centered at 2485 and 2468 MHz, respectively. The
measured axial ratio at broadside for the CP mode is similar to the results in Fig. 5, except that
the CP center frequency has a decrease of ~ 20 MHz.
The other design (Design II) is using a fixed stub length, and the antenna structure is
presented in Fig. 9. The end of the stub is connected to a grounded PIN diode through a pin.
Consequently, the stub is short-circuited when the diode is on and open-circuited when the
diode is off. The required stub length, ls3, can be decided from the results in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2,
it is found that the stub lengths of prototypes A and F are almost the same and they respectively
have a lower and a higher axial ratio, so ls3 can be set to 0.19λe. The antenna prototype is also
fabricated and tested. The results are shown in Fig. 10. For the LP and CP modes, the
impedance bandwidths are respectively 8 and 19 %, and their center frequencies are almost the
same (~ 2477 MHz). The CP and LP radiation patterns are also measured at 2516 MHz, and the
results are respectively plotted in Figs. 11 and 12. Broadside radiation patterns are obtained for
the two different polarizations. The cross polarization level is about 20 dB when the antenna is
operated at the LP mode and the axial ratio of 0.6 dB is obtained for the CP mode. Due to the
asymmetry of the microstrip feed line, the variation of the axial ratio against elevation angle
(θ) is also studied. The measured results at ψ = 0°, 45°, and 90° planes are shown in Fig. 13.
Symmetry CP performances within the main beam are observed. In addition, the peak gain of
the CP radiation is found to be about 6.8 dBc and it is 0.5 dB higher than that of the LP mode,
which could be due to the ohmic loss of the diode. The performances of the two SPMA designs
are summarized in Table 1.
Comparing the two designs described above, the effects of the bias circuit for Design I
cannot be neglected. The reason is that the bias circuit needs to be connected to the open stub
that is the critical parameter of determining the CP performance. It is mentioned that the bias
circuit is not considered in the simulation analysis, and therefore the difference between the
two CP results in Fig. 8 is relatively obvious. On the contrary, the effects of the bias circuit for
Design II is less, and even can be ignored if the required DC voltage is fed along with RF
