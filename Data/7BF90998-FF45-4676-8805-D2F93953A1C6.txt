Abstract—System block diagrams for peak current-mode (PCM) 
control of buck-boost converters with and without input filters are 
derived in this paper. The system block diagram with an input 
filter shows that new current loop contains an input voltage 
feed-forward loop as a sub-loop. Also, the block diagram with 
current feedback generates a new transfer function due to the 
input filter. However, the new system block diagram can be 
derived the current loop influenced by the input filter and 
control-to-output transfer functions. Therefore, this paper 
proposes four design criteria of the input filters for buck-boost 
converter to prevent system oscillation or degradation. 
 
Index Terms—Peak current-mode, Buck-boost converters, 
Block diagrams, Input filters, Transfer function. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE current-mode converter responses rapidly and can be 
connected in parallel; therefore, it is commonly applied to 
power supply unit, power factor corrector (PFC), and LED 
driver circuit [1]-[6]. Normally, input filter is added to the 
power supply of converters to prevent the electromagnetic 
interference (EMI). The use of input filter significantly changes 
the dynamic characteristics of the converter, and even causes 
loop gain, output impedance, and degradation of system 
stability. However, the design of the input filter is not only to 
satisfy EMI requirements, but also to consider the dynamic 
effects of converter. Input impedance in converters has the 
characteristic of negative resistance so that the design of input 
filter requires the adequate damping resistors to prevent the 
system oscillation [7]-[13]. Paper in [8] demonstrated that the 
input impedance 
SZ  of voltage mode converter must satisfy 
three inequalities to prevent oscillation or degradation in 
converter. Papers in both [14] and [15] utilized the y-parameter 
model of both [11] and [12] derived the design criterion of input 
filters for current-mode converter. However, the current loop 
with y-parameter is more complicated to express the 
characteristics in the current loop of the current-mode converter. 
Paper [16] was based on the canonical model and exact average 
model [13] and used the extra element theorem [17] to derive 
new design criteria and transfer function.  
In addition to the original inequalities, the oscillation of the 
current-mode converter was the oscillation caused by the input 
voltage feed-forward loop. The transfer function here is more 
complex because the input voltage feed-forward loop is about 
an independent loop. Paper in [18] was based on the extra 
element theorem to derive the transfer functions of converter 
include input filters. However, [19] stated that the extra element 
 
 
theorem is not suitable for analyzing the input filters of 
current-mode converter. That is because the use of input filters 
will cause voltage feed-forward loops. However, [19] only used 
the buck converter for analysis and disregarded other converters. 
Papers in [20]-[22] about the buck-boost converters were not 
related with input filters on buck-boost converters and block 
diagrams. This paper uses the small-signal model introduced by 
Ridley [23] to derive new block diagrams and circuit transfer 
functions for buck-boost converters and examines the dynamic 
characteristics of the circuits and finally derives new design 
criteria for input filters of current-mode converters. Simulations 
are testified with the circuit of a buck-boost converter. 
 
II. BLOCK DIAGRAM AND TRANSFER FUNCTION OF THE 
BUCK-BOOST CONVERTER WITHOUT INPUT FILTER 
Fig. 1 shows the operation of the buck-boost converter with 
peak current-mode control and consists of the input filter, power 
stage, and current-mode controller. Fig. 1 also shows the 
pulse-width modulation (PWM) switch in the power stage has 
three nodes: active node (a), passive node (p), and common 
node (c). According to the small-signal model for the PWM 
switch introduced in [24],[25] and the small-signal model for 
the current-mode controller introduced by Ridley [23], the 
small-signal model of the buck-boost converter is designed as 
the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 2. The feed-forward gain 
[23] is as shown below.

IV. DESIGN CRITERIA FOR INPUT FILTERS 
With input filter added, the transfer functions of circuits are 
changed in dynamic characteristics. In order to reduce the effect, 
both the unmodified and modified current loop gain must be 
similar that is 
'( ) ( )i iT s T s . Therefore, the following 
inequalities then can be obtained:

In addition, both uY  and aY  in (23) are positive real numbers. 
As SY  is a real number that frequency approaches the resonance 
frequency, less than uY  or aY , and the current loop gain 
' ( )iT s  
contains a negative sign, oscillation occurs in the circuit at this 
point. Similarity, oscillation will not be happened and only 
dynamic characteristics will be influenced when (32) and (33) 
are not satisfied. That is because HY  and LY  are not real 
numbers. 
V. DESIGN EXAMPLE 
In this paper, circuit simulation software, SIMPLIS, is used 
for the buck-boost converter. Fig. 5 and 6 show the current loop 
gain and control-to-output Bode plot so that the V4 is used to 
control the duty ratio and V2 is used as a test signal for 
measuring the Bode plot. R6 is the equivalent parallel resistance 
of the input filter. In addition, the circuit switch frequency and 
duty ratio are 50 kHz and 0.3, respectively.  
Fig. 7 shows the frequency relationship among SY , aY , 
and uY  that with the parallel equivalent resistance 20pR  , the 
minimum value of SY  is greater than uY  and aY . Therefore, the 
circuit is not oscillated. In addition, with the parallel equivalent 
resistance 60pR  , the minimum value of SY is lower than uY . 
At this point, ' ( )iT s  is negative, and oscillation is happened in 
the system. Fig. 8 shows the voltage output waveform of 
60pR   and it is obviously includes the oscillation of low 
frequency.

VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper derives system block diagrams and system 
transfer functions for buck-boost converters with peak 
current-mode control, with and without the inclusion of an input 
filter. The new system with the inclusion of an input filter is a 
three-loop system that the input voltage feed-forward loop fT  
is the inner loop for the new current loop
'
iT . Four design criteria 
for the input filters and two conditions that cause system 
oscillation derived from the new current loop transfer function. 
Within the system, positive feedback from feed-forward gain 
fk caused these two conditions. In addition, theoretical and 
simulative results both demonstrated that the addition of an 
input filter only slightly influenced Bode plots of 
control-to-output, due to the desensitivity of current 
negative feedback.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to propose a kind of transparent glass window design with 
energy-saving and heat insulation capabilities to cope with the energy-saving and carbon 
reduction issues. An optical thin film coating technology was used in coating multilayered 
dielectric materials on the transparent glass to achieve an infrared ray shielding effect. This 
aims to prevent the indoor room temperature from rising easily due to infrared ray incidence 
from outdoor, and the “thermal flux” effect of the transparent window to allow the indoor 
room temperature to increase more easily in winter due to infrared ray incidence from outdoor. 
This heat insulation window is able to allow 98% of visible light penetration through the 
window, and at the mean time, allow 90% of infrared light reflection and roughly 10% of

1. Preface 
 
Glass is an important building material and has increasingly been used in the architecture 
industry following a growing demand in decoration purposes. Today, however, apart from 
taking aesthetic and appearance characteristics of glass into consideration, people are also 
paying more attention on its abilities to control heat and cooling costs, as well as sunlight 
projection to bring in comfort, balance and other issues to room interior. This has thus made 
the Low-E Glass in the coated glass category to emerge as the focus of attention by the 
people. 
  
 
Low-E Glass is also known as low emissivity glass, of which is derived from coating 
multilayer of metallic films or other compounds on a glass surface to form a coated product 
[1]-[3]. In this paper, the coated layer has the characteristics of high visible light penetration 
and high reflection of mid-infrared ray. It features the following significant merits when 
compared with the common glasses and conventional architectural coated glasses. 
 
(1) Excellent thermal performance 
The transmittance of exterior door and window is greatly related to the thermal 
conduction of a building to account for more than 50% of its energy consumption. Relevant 
studies have indicated that heat conduction at the inner surface of glass is dominated by 
radiation, taking up 58% of overall heat consumption. This means that the most effective way 
to inhibit radiation at the inner surface of glass is to change the glass performance to reduce 
the heat conduction of heat energy. The emissivity of ordinary float glass is as high as 0.84, 
but this can be reduced below 0.1 when coated with a low emissivity film of multilayer 
dielectric materials. Therefore, the use of architectural glass door and window made in this 
The only flaw, however, is a slightly poor heat insulation effect and so it is more suitable to 
use in cold regions to prevent heat loss and keep warm in buildings. 
2. Soft Low-E Glass 
The excellent heat insulation effect has made it ideal to use in tropical regions. However, 
as its metallic coating is unable to resist high temperature, and tends to oxidize after being 
long-term exposure to air, it is more suitable to make into flat multi-layered glass. 
3. PET Low-E Glass 
Such thin film, also known as PET Low-E Film, can be applied in single, laminated, and 
multi-layered combination glass sheets. Due to its excellent heat insulation, UV resistant and 
sound insulation performances, and capable of keeping warm in winter and cool in summer, it 
is suitable to use both in tropical and cold regions. 
3. Coating principles and methods 
 
3.1 Basic coating principles  
The merits of general metallic reflective film are simple manufacturing equipment and 
technology in production, and a wide operating wavelength and reflective band. The 
disadvantages are high optical loss and a possible high reflectivity. An increase in reflectivity 
would adversely lower the transmittance to affect the image quality. Most importantly, the 
metallic film (gold, silver, chrome and aluminum) has a high absorption band on infrared ray, 
causing the infrared ray unable (or difficult) to pass through the metallic-coated heat 
insulation glass window to result in high infrared ray absorption. So, it is ineffective to 
insulate against infrared heat. 
 
The heat insulation coated window is made up of a sheet of transparent substrate (such as 
a transparent glass) coated with a layer of dielectric coating in two different wave fields for 
the penetration of visible light and infrared ray. Therein, the visible light wave field is a 
spectral area of high penetration and low reflectance; and the infrared wave field is a spectral 
area of high reflection and low penetration ratio. For example, after a 100% incidence ray has 
struck on the coating material, there is 98% penetration of visible light to form a high 
transmission rate; and 90% reflectivity of infrared ray, meaning 90% of infrared ray reflection 
from the material and 10% of infrared ray penetration. At this point, the optical divide ratio of 
high reflection and low penetration is 90:10. Generally speaking, the loss (such as absorption) 
from the coated substrate and coating materials on light is relatively small, and so this loss of 
light is neglected. The simple calculation is 100% infrared light = 90% reflection + 10% 
penetration as shown in Fig. 1. 
utilizes a multi-layered coating to reflect 90% of infrared ray, and penetration of 10% infrared 
light and 98% visible light. As shown in Fig. 1, L refers to as the infrared ray incidence, L1 as 
the infrared ray reflection, L2 as the infrared ray penetration, and P1 as the visible light 
penetration. 
 
    A piece of coated sample was made during the experiment. The main parameters of the 
spectra are as follows: (1) The y-coordinates refer to as the transmittance T% (transmittance 
%), (2) the x-coordinates as the spectrum wavelength (nm), (a) as the white light environment, 
(b) as the positive incidence angle (0 degree), (c) as the reference wavelength of 450nm, and 
(d) as a quarter wavelength. 
 
Fig. 3: The spectrogram of the coated sample 
 
In thin film optics, we can easily obtain the predicted transmittance T% from vector or 
admittance diagram method through multi-layered coating with a high refractive index on the 
quarter-wave stack of the optical-grade substrate. Theoretically, we can also prove that the 
reflectivity obtained from quarter-wave stack is much higher than non-quarter-wave stack 
when a similar multi-layered coating is used. The greater the coating layers, the greater will 
be the reflectivity R%. That is to say, we can easily control the proportion of penetration and 
reflection. In the current existing coating materials, the high reflectivity in visible light area is 
smaller or equal to 2.4, and that the low reflectivity is greater than or equal to 1.35. Therefore, 
the high reflective band width of single quarter-wave stack is limited. 
  
3.3 The widening method 
Hence, in order to verify in this paper that there is a wider reflective band in the visible 
light area similar to that of metallic film, we must widen the high reflective band of the entire 
dielectic coating. 
 
    The widening method is to regularly increase the concentration in every layer of coating 
progressively (according to geometric progression or arithmetic progression). In this way, any

3.4 Transparent substrate 
The transparent substrate can generally be classified into two categories of optical-grade 
transparent glass and transparent resin. The transparent substrate must primarily have a high 
level of transparency and a strict surface requirement, and as far as possible without any 
speckles and stripes, air pores, whitening, fogginess, black spots, discoloration, roughness, 
poor luster and other defects. The transparency of visible light and infrared ray on the 
transparent substrate is also affected by light reflection, penetration, absorption, scattering and 
other factors. The light scattering and absorption phenomena caused by light incidence on the 
optical-grade transparent substrate are negligible as compared to metallic coating, and so they 
are neglected.  
 
    In industrial plastics, the transparent resins with a high transparency includes PMMA 
(transparency of roughly 93%), PC (transparency of roughly 88%), PS (transparency of 
roughly 89%), CR-39 (transparency of roughly 90%), SAN resin (transparency of roughly 
90%), MS resin (transparency of roughly 90%), and TPX (transparency of roughly greater 
than 90%). In addition, the transparency of polymethylene ether, styrene copolymer (MAS), 
PET, PP and PVC, etc. is also impressive. 
 
    When light enters the transparent resin, part of it will get lost through surface reflection. 
Reflection is normally calculated from surface reflectivity R% through the polymer, where n1 
(=1) of refers to as the refractive index, and n2 as the refractive index arises from vertical 
light incidence from the air, and is represented by (n-1)2 divided by (n+1)2. Data from 
manufactures indicate that the refractive index of transparent acrylic (Polymethyl 
methacrylate or PMMA) is 1.49, and the surface refractive index R% can be calculated as 
roughly 4%. The full transmittance of PMMA is roughly 93%. The loss of light on this 
material is mostly caused by secondary reflection on the surface, and that the interior loss 
through light absorption and scattering is negligible.  
 
When light enters the transparent resin molecules, the molecules will absorb the light 
energy and generate a rotary motion to lead to light absorption, thus lowering the 
transmittance. During light absorption, the scattering light generated simultaneously will also 
significantly reduce the transmittance. As the scattering rate at transparent resin interior is 
directly proportional to the power of eight of reflective index, and inversely proportional to 
the power of four of wavelength, therefore, the light scattering loss on material with a low 
reflective index is small, and the effect of light scattering on visible light area of longer 
wavelength is also small. In the infrared domain of longer wavelength, the impact on light
