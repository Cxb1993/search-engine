Introduction 
The tasks of MIMO control can be divided into two different control structures: single-level 
[1]-[19] and two-level [20]-[22]. In the single-level MIMO control, the whole control system 
consists of the process and the controller connected in a single loop. For complex practical 
systems, the single-loop MIMO control systems may not effectively achieve the control 
objectives, and a multi-level control structure turns out to be very helpful. For example, an 
advantage of single-level sliding mode control is its robustness to uncertainties [2][3][19]. 
However, chattering problem that results in low control accuracy and high heat loss in electrical 
power circuits is inevitable in the sliding mode control [19]. Recently, single-level LMI-based 
controllers have been successfully applied to the tracking control design for nonlinear systems 
[19]. However, the LMI-based technique needs perfect mathematical model as fuzzy model or 
neural model of the nonlinear system and uses these model’s parameters to solve the robust 
control gains of the system. Since perfect model of the system is almost impossible, the technique 
seems impractical for nonlinear system design. 
Recently, based on the two-level control structure, adaptive control schemes have been 
introduced to deal with nonlinear systems [20]-[22]. However, the complicated parameter update 
law and control algorithm make this control scheme impractical, especially in the case of 
considering the fuzzy control[20][22], fuzzy-neural control or neural-fuzzy control[21] due to too 
many control parameters must be updated, and too many singularity solutions must be avoided. 
Hence, we proposed a two-level order-based method to simplify the complex single-level and 
two-level parameters based fuzzy or neural control. There are only a simple inner-level controller 
(that is order-based controller), an outer level control, and a compensator in our control system. 
The main advantage or idea of the two-level order-based control is that different controllers can 
be designed to target different objectives, so that each controller is simpler and performance is 
improved. The nonlinear effect of the system can be canceled by supervisory which is outer-level 
controller. In this way, we do not need too many adaptive control parameters, and the reasonable 
adaptive control parameters are more important than the complex adaptive fuzzy or neural control 
parameters in [20]-[22]. The difference between our two-level approach and those in [20]-[22] is 
that we reduce the amount of adaptation parameters largely without including unnecessary or 
over control parameters and complicated adaptive scheme, and we consider how to reduce the 
power consumption in the two-level controller. In general, the past two-level control don’t 
consider the saving of power consumption. We will show the details of this approach in the next 
section. The advantage of proposed tracking control design is not only that only a simple 
two-level order-based controller is used in our approach without using off-line LMI method [19] 
or having over adaptive control parameters[20]-[22], but also the control performance is better 
were in the open left-half complex plane. However, the nonlinear functions )(f  and )(g  are 
unknown, and 0w  is not measurable and accidental disturbance in our problem, so obtaining 
the control law (3) is impossible. In this situation, our purpose is to approximate )(f  and )(g  
by the following T-S fuzzy model [19],

Step 5: As a comparison about the contribution of the rule reduction and green power to this

Case 4: The LMI-based fuzzy controller design’s method [19]. 
From the computer simulations, the huge accidental disturbance may yield worst tracking 
performance, but our method may let the control system be more robustness and lower power 
consumption in attenuating the effect of the combined disturbance. 
 
Conclusion 
We proposed a supervised adaptive control scheme for MIMO systems in this project. The 
scheme is able to effectively response to unexpected disturbances with reduced transient behavior. 
Robustness of the scheme to modeling error between nonlinear system and the rule-reduced T-S 
fuzzy model is also achieved with simple design procedure. Furthermore, chattering is reduced 
with a subtle modification of the switching decision of the supervisory control signal. Advantages 
of the proposed tracking control design are demonstrated using the simulation study of the control 
of a 2 DOF robot arm where comparisons are made with the LMI scheme.

ABSTRACT 
This paper presents the development of a three-dimensional environment reconstruction system using a laser range finder. 
The original design of URG-04LX laser range finder, provided by Hokuyo Inc., is efficient in providing two-dimensional 
distance information. To enhance the capability of the device, we developed a rotation mechanism to provide it a sweep 
motion for stereo data collection. Geometric equations are derived that includes parameters of misalignment that are 
unavoidable in manufacturing and assembling. The parameters are calibrated according to practical data measurement of 
three relatively-perpendicular planes. The calibration is formulated as an optimization problem solved using the Nelder-
Mead simplex algorithm. Validity of the calibration scheme is demonstrated by the reconstruction of several real-world 
scenes.   
Keywords: 3D reconstruction, scanning laser range finder, simplex algorithm, calibration 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The URG-04LX laser range finder, provided by Hokuyo Inc., is a high performance two-dimensional distance sensor 
commercially available at a reasonable cost, less than $2,000. Effective measuring distance of the device is from 20 to 
4,000 mm with a resolution of 1 mm. The scan angle is restricted to 240° with angular resolution of 0.36° and maximum 
scanning rate of 10 frames per second. All this capabilities are provided within a volume of 50×50×70 mm3 and weights 
only 160 g. Fig. 1 shows its measurement accuracy represented as a function of distance tested at our laboratory. 
According to the experimental results, its measurement errors stay within 6 mm when the object distance is less than 
1,200 mm, and within 14 mm up to 1,800 mm.

2.2 Coordinates and their transformation 
At any moment, the laser range finder provides at most 667 points (scan angle being 240° with angular resolution of 
0.36°). If each data is denotes as PA , where frame {A} is attached to the laser range finder, as defined in Fig. 2, we wish 
to find PU  to construct 3-D model of the environment. We can transform PA into PU  as 
PTP AUA
U ⋅=      (1)  
In (1), the coordinate transformation is concisely represented as a homogeneous transformation matrix [7]: TUA

Equation (2) is defined in terms of the rotational parameters, α , β  and γ , and the relative position of origin of frame 
{A} relative to that of frame {U}, xA, yA, and zA.  
Referring to Fig. 2 (b), if frame {A} rotates about axis  of frame {U} by an angle UXˆ θ , where the newly positioned 
frame {A} is denoted as frame {A’} for simplicity, then the coordinate transformation becomes

3. CALIBRATION OF THE PARAMETERS 
3.1 Calibration system 
The homogeneous transformation matrix , defined in (2), is crucial for 3-D reconstruction, according to equations (1) 
and (3). The matrix includes six parameters, 
TUA
α , β , γ , xA, yA, and zA, which must be accurately calibrated. In this 
section, we describe an arrangement proposed and implemented for this calibration. 
The proposed calibration procedure requires three relatively-perpendicular planes. As shown in Fig. 3, we have 
conveniently made use of the lower part of a table in our laboratory as these calibration planes. The planes are white in 
the picture. If the rotating laser range finder is placed in front of the planes and rotates in three pitch angles, three sets of 
planar scanning data will be generated. We have marked in Fig. 3 three sets of red lines manually to show the geometry 
of the scanned data. Note that the laser light emitted from the scanner is infrared, which is actually invisible to human 
eyes. The idea is that, if the parameters are correct, then the intersected points, points B1, B2, and B3 in the left set and 
points C1, C2, and C3 in the right set, will be aligned in a vertical line, respectively.

Note that the cost definition of equation (6) considers only horizontal, X and Y, coordinates, since the alignment line is 
vertical.  
 
3.3 The optimization procedure to obtain the parameters 
In the optimization problem, a candidate solution is defined as a set of parameters to be optimized: 
],,,,, [ AAA zyxγβαϑ = , 
The optimization problem is then defined as searching for the bestϑ  that has the minimum Cost value. The optimization 
problem is solved by the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. The Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm is a descent search 
algorithm, making no use of the objective function derivatives.  
A simplex is a geometrical structure with (n+1) vertices in an n-dimensional search problem, where n=6 for this 
calibration problem. Through a sequence of geometric transformations, namely, reflection, contraction and extension, the 
initial simplex moves, expands or contracts. After each transformation, the current worst vertex is replaced by a better 
one. 
In practice, the searching process deeply depends on initial values of the vertices, and is always trapped by local optima. 
To alleviate this problem and increase its search robustness, we can start the process more than one time and select the 
best answer from these trials. Alternatively, we can randomly start the algorithm (n+1) times for some steps, and 
continue the search with these intermediate results.  
 
 
 
 
4. VERIFICATION OF CALIBRATION 
 
To verify the correctness of the parameters, a vertical plane is firstly placed in front of the 3-D scanner, and is placed at 
10 different distances from 120 mm to 550 mm, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The reconstructed 3-D is shown in Fig. 7(b). 
According to these data, the models are vertical and parallel to each other.

D models. 
 
Two more illustrations of 3-D reconstruction using the calibrated parameters are also conducted. Fig. 8 is a scenario 
when the 3-D scanner is placed in an empty room with an opened door. The reconstructed 3-D model of this scenario is 
shown in Fig. 9.  
Fig. 10 is a picture of the second test scenario. In this scenario, the 3-D scanner is placed in front of a box, a chair, and a 
water tank. As shown in Fig. 11, the reconstructed model clearly demonstrates the correctness of the obtained parameters.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presented a framework of building 3-D environment models using a 2-D laser range finder. We developed a 
rotation mechanism to provide the URG-04LX laser range finder a sweep motion for stereo data collection. In order to 
accurately reconstruct 3-D distance with the device, precise geometric parameters of the mechanism are required. We 
propose a calibration procedure that requires three relatively-perpendicular planes. The calibration problem is tailored as 
searching for the best parameters that have the minimum Cost value, and is solved by the Nelder-Mead simplex 
algorithm. As the searching process deeply depends on initial values for the algorithm, we suggest randomly starting the 
algorithm for many times and continuing the search with these intermediate results. Two 3-D reconstruction examples 
using the calibrated parameters are presented that clearly verify correctness of the results.
