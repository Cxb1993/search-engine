Abstract 
 
The transition-band balanced steady-state 
free precession (SSFP) functional MRI (fMRI) 
technique was reported to exhibit strong 
potential for high resolution fMRI due to its 
distortion-free nature.  Theoretically, the 
length of RF pulse train in SSFP fMRI, and 
consequently the image matrix size, is unlimited 
at the expense of reduced temporal resolution.  
However, as voxel size reduces at higher 
resolution, decreased image signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) can become a critical concern to observe 
minute neuronal activations.  Therefore, in this 
study, we attempted to investigate the feasibility 
of SSFP fMRI at sub-millimeter in-plane 
resolution to achieve a voxel volume of 0.38 
mm3 using a clinical 3.0-Tesla system.  In 
addition, the SNR and percentage activation 
signals were evaluated as a function of spatial 
resolutions to observe the benefits of decreased 
voxel size. 
 
Keywords: balanced steady-state free 
precession, functional MRI, spatial resolution, 
visual stimulation. 
 
二、計畫緣由與目的 
 
SSFP fMRI technique was reported to have 
potential for high resolution fMRI due to its 
distortion-free and steady-state image [1,2].  
Because steady-state signal is maintained 
through acquisition of all k-lines, without 
experiencing T2* decay as in echo train of EPI, 
SSFP fMRI does not suffer from blurring 
artifact and true high resolution imaging can be 
achieved.  Theoretically speaking, the length of 
RF pulse train, and therefore matrix size, in 
SSFP fMRI is not limited, if encoding gradient 
strength allows and lower temporal resolution is 
acceptable.  However, as voxel size reduces at 
higher resolution, decreased image signal to 
noise ratio (SNR) can be a concern to observe 
minute neuronal activation.  For fMRI 
experiments performed at high field, SNR can 
be gained from increased field strength, 
especially when virtually no image distortion 
would be brought about in SSFP fMRI image.  
In this study, we investigated the feasibility of 
SSFP fMRI at sub-millimeter resolution.  
Activation maps from high resolution SSFP 
fMRI were shown with more delicate alignment 
between activated areas and grey matter cortical 
structures on T1-weighted images.  Besides, 
SSFP fMRI were evaluated at multiple 
resolutions to observe the effects of decreased 
voxel size.  
high resolution (voxel size < 1mm3) has not 
been reported before.  Therefore, experiment 
results from other group for validation are not 
available at this moment.  Despite increased 
activation signal (> 14%) at matrix size of 
512x512, substantial SNR drop was also 
observed with voxel reducing factor of 64, 
which was predictable according to basic rules 
of MRI.  Reduced partial volume effect in a 
single voxel is an explanation for increased 
activation signal in high resolution SSFP fMRI.  
However, it has to be noted that additional 
experiment is required to find out to what extent 
reduced voxel size contributes to increased 
activation signal and the optimized fMRI 
resolution considering functional contrast. 
 
五、計畫成果自評 
 
Our efforts spent in this project have 
created results substantially greater than that 
mentioned in this brief report, which is an 
excerpted version of a published conference 
paper in 2007 Proceedings of the International 
Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (7).  
The concept of fast MR imaging has also led to 
other related investigations in MR spectroscopic 
imaging, leading to two journal articles (one 
published and one revised) in Magnetic 
Resonance in Medicine (8,9).  Overall, the 
project has generated about ten conference 
papers presented in the 2007 Annual Meeting of 
the International Society of Magnetic 
Resonance in Medicine, which raised substantial 
attention from many international research 
teams.  The achievements from this project 
have strong potential both in daily clinical 
examinations for pre-surgical planning in 
patients with brain tumors and in psychological 
investigations involving the cerebral columns.  
In short, although project continuation is still 
needed for this relatively challenging topic (i.e., 
fMRI at sub-millimeter resolution without 
geometric distortions), we have confidence that 
the execution of our three-year project can be 
regarded as highly successful, with positive 
impact on further imaging acceleration and 
better utilization of MRI in routine diagnosis.

國際醫用磁共振學會第十五屆年會 
The Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the International Society 
for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 
2006/5/19~2005/5/25, Berlin, Germany

一、參加會議經過 
 
國際醫用磁共振學會（ International Society for Magnetic Resonance in 
Medicine；ISMRM）之年會一向以匯集各項先進磁共振（magnetic resonance；
MR）技術發展的論文報告而著稱，今年於德國柏林市舉行的第十五屆年會亦不
例外。由於 MR 在國內的發展日趨重要，人員素質也逐漸趨於整齊，因此雖然
單程飛行時間長達十三小時（不含轉機之延誤），本年度台灣地區參加人員（含
放射科醫師以及研究人員在內）較去年之四十人以上更為增加，粗略估計有五十
人以上，並且臨床醫師參與度也明顯提高。本人實驗室研究群今年共發表二十一
篇文章，較之去年的二十篇仍有持續進展，並包括五場演講報告，遠超出國內其
他單位之表現。實驗室含研究生、畢業學生等超過二十人參加此次會議，其中九
人獲得 ISMRM Student Stipend Award、四人獲得 ISMRM New Entrant Award。 
 
會議於德國柏林市西側的 International Convention Center舉行，議程共分五
天進行，之前再外加兩天的  educational courses。單是五天內的  Scientific 
Meetings 總共有超過九百八十場的 oral presentations 以及兩千九百個 poster 
presentations，參加人數將近約七千人。場地空間比前一年西雅圖市的會議大非
常多，使得聆聽不同場地的演講所需要的腳程增加不少。壁報展示的空間相對較
為集中，閱覽次數也如去年一樣甚高。會場附近旅館價格均甚昂貴，為節省公帑，
本年度本人研究群比照去年方式，租用 weekly rental的一般公寓共計五間，除剛
好距離會場不遠之外，在人數眾多的情形下也得以節約住宿支出。此外，由於公
寓內廚房器具一應俱全，在三餐上亦可選擇自行烹煮，避免飲食不習慣所產生之
水土不服情形。 
 
二、與會心得 
 
 會議一開始邀請 2003 年以 MRI 上卓越貢獻而獲得諾貝爾生理醫學獎的 
Sir Peter Mansfield 作開場的年度 Mansfield Lecture。很遺憾由於健康因素，臨
時由 Peter Morris （按：為與 Mansfield 共同著有 MRI 書籍之同儕作者）代替。
演講當中對於如何在資源有限的原始環境中一步步推動研發、如何在未知的磁場
生物效應下以自身從事實驗等等，都有概略性的介紹，大師風骨令人印象深刻。
另一位諾貝爾獎得主 Paul Lauterbur 則因在數月前過世，而由中央研究院何潛院
士在週四早晨作 Tribute lecture。儘管兩位重量級人士獲獎已晚，距離當初突破
4 
限制的論文開始有增加並且排在極為重要的講演時段，對於擴散影像 group 
comparison的結果也提出不少的質疑。

from nine different research groups using the same source data.  The green voxels in I 
highlight the skeletonised search volume, while the orange voxels indicate reduced 
anisotropy in schizophrenics.  The results showed minimal consistency in voxel-based 
group comparison using DTI data.  See ISMRM Abstract #74 entitled What Happens 
When Nine Different Groups Analyze the Same DT-MRI Data Set Using Voxel-Based 
Methods? by Jones D et al. from Cardiff University Brain Repair and Imaging Centre,

本年度另一個重要的課題，是有關於 Gadolinium-based MRI 顯影劑所引起
的腎因性全身纖維化病變（nephrogenic systemic firbosis；NSF）。此病變在 1997
年首先發現病例發表，患者皮膚的纖維化嚴重程度可達硬如石頭，關節無法伸
展，有些需終身倚靠輪椅，重者可引起死亡，但當時並不知道引起病變的原因。
由於歐盟與北美公衛系統的完善與發達，在經過長期的回顧性追蹤後發現病患均
在過去曾接受 MRI 檢查與顯影劑注射，並且都有腎功能方面的缺損（按：
Gd-based non-specific MRI 顯影劑均以尿液作為排泄管道），因而開始懷疑與 
MRI 顯影劑無法及時排出體外有關。而研究者在皮膚  biopsy 檢體驗出 
gadolinium，更是為此假說提出了有力的支援。儘管目前並無直接證據顯示一定
是由 MRI 顯影劑引發，但醫界與學界已對全世界發出警訊，並且對於臨床 MRI 
檢測做出更為保守的建議。

agents, the ISMRM (as well as other societies such as RSNA) has issued global 
warnings regarding proper use of all Gd-based contrast agents.

三、考察參觀活動 
 
本年度在時間上並不充裕：週日約中午時間抵達會場報到，週五會議結束後
次日清晨即離開德國，中間時段全數在會場吸取新知，因此無暇抽空參觀柏林市
區學校或觀光景點。 
 
四、建議 
 
 近幾年來，國內在 MR 領域的發展已漸具規模特色。台大醫院、陽明大學、
台北榮民總醫院、長庚大學、中研院生醫所、高雄醫學大學、台中榮總、新店慈
濟醫院等單位一如往年都有階段性成果發表，其中高雄醫學大學化學系王雲銘教
授的 contrast agent study 更獲得壁報論文獎，值得慶賀。本人於台大電機系與三
軍總醫院、台大醫院、高雄榮民總醫院等醫學中心合作的研究成績則一如去年，
單以二十一篇論文的數量而言，排名約在全世界前十大左右，遙遙領先國內其他
單位。五個學生的 oral presentations 表現不俗，與聽眾問答逐漸得以自如。更可
喜的是本人已畢業的研究生，如今已可帶領自己的研究團隊，以中山大學、逢甲
大學、台灣科技大學等國內的角色出發走向國際，與世界一流研究群分庭抗禮，
足見長期耕耘的成效。雖然會議論文數量並非世界一流的唯一指標，但研究團隊
所走出的第一步已提供了良好基礎，對往後提升研究品質與影響力更有實質助
益。 
 
在過去會議中，本人與 Massachusetts General Hospital、Brigham Women 
Hospital、University of Pennsylvania、University of Freiburg、Johns Hopkins 
University 等多所名校醫學中心均曾深入討論有關磁振造影人才培育方面的議
題。如今上述單位均已接受本人研究生以國際交換學生身份前往進修，也逐年看
到實質成果，令人欣慰。今年則將觸角繼續伸往 Columbia University、University 
of California at Irvine、Boston University、Duke University、University of New 
Mexico 等單位。綜合上述討論，個人以為國內的磁振造影發展，已跳脫了十年
前的默默無聞，也比五年前僅靠少數幾人撐場面要好得多。國內相關單位如國科
會等，若願意提升台灣磁振造影研究群在國際間的地位，現在應該正是時候。尤
其對於已有良好基礎的年輕學者（如本次發表 16 篇論文的台科大黃騰毅教授、
發表 10篇論文的台大林發暄教授、發表 9篇的陽明大學林慶波教授、發表 8篇
論文的逢甲大學劉益瑞教授、發表 7篇即將返台任教的台大吳文超教授、發表 7

院阮春榮醫師等）除更應加以重視、賦予高度研究自由度之外，也應追蹤其後續
期刊論文之發表，據以提供適當研究資源。1997年 ISMRM YIA得獎者林宜蓁博

後林博士便離開台灣往國外發展，不啻為人才的一大損失。而在本人疾呼重視有
潛力的年輕學者的情形下，去年方返國的國家衛生院陳南圭教授（今年亦發表 6
篇論文）又已決定離台赴美，去年本人報告中的預測不幸成為事實。單以此次參
加會議為例，前所述及的優秀年輕學者竟有兩人得不到國科會出國參加會議的經
費補助，未免過於離譜！因此，國內應審慎加以思考人力與物力分配的邏輯，不
應再一味依據資深程度來補助大型儀器的擁有者。如此才是鼓勵高品質研究的正

Introduction: 
In human experiments, a 40% to 59% increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and a 3% 
increase of BOLD signals has been documented under 5% CO2 inhalation [1,2]. 
Simultaneous acquisition of CBF, cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO), and cerebral 
blood volume (CBV) under hypercapnia challenge has not been documented before. 
We aim to investigate the change of CBF, CBO and CBV under hypercapnia challenge 
test using a hybrid pulse sequence modified from Yangs original design [3].  
 
Materials and Methods: 
This study was performed on a 3T MR scanner (Achiva). The optimal inversion delay 
time (TI) for blood attenuation was measured using a multi-TI dynamic inversion 
recovery scan (Fi.g 1). The CBF, CVO and CBV images were acquired using a hybrid 
pulse sequence (Fig. 2) modified from the Yangs sequence design [3]. With applying 
alternative selective and nonselective inversion gradients, dual echo EPI acquisitions 
provide images for generating 
CBF, CBO and CBV images [3]. 
The fMRI study and hypercapnic 
challenge were done using 
methods as described by Juan CJ, 
et al. in 2006 [4]. For hypercapnia 
challenge, 5% of CO2 was inhaled 
by the healthy subject. 
Segmentation of gray matter using 
Fuzzy C-means method was done 
for analysis of signal change of 
gray matter after hypercapnic 
perturbation.  
 
Results:  
Figure 3 showed the CBF, CBO and CBV maps on one visual stimulating fMRI study. 
BOLD image was most sensitive, followed by FAIR and VASO images in a decreasing 
order. On challenge test, a 20% (FAIR), .4% (BOLD) and 0.6% (VASO) change of 
signal intensity was noted between steady state hypercapnic and resting statuses. 
 
Discussion: 
Our study provides a simultaneous measurement of three physiologic parameters 
under hypercapnic challenge, which is free from inter-experiment variation. Our 
results are consistent with prior researcher regarding the CBF and BOLD signal 
changes [1,2]. Unlike the apparent increase of CBF and BOLD signals, the CBV 
remains relatively unchanged after CO2 perturbation. Due to the limitation of case 
number, further investigations with adequate subjects are necessary to clarify the 
behavior of CBV under hypercapnic challenge.

Assessment of Longitudinal Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Changes Using MR Tracer Kinetics in Human Brain Infarction

Introduction 
The tracer kinetic models of MR perfusion-weighted images have been widely used in the measurement of the angiogenetic activity in patients with brain tumors, 
while using the same model in evaluating the pathophysiologic process of ischemic stroke are relatively rare. Since the pathologic evolution of infarct regions may 
have a close link with blood-brain barrier (BBB) defects [1], we aim to apply the experimental data in this study to investigate whether the infarct growth can be 
evaluated by the known pharmacokinetic models focusing on contrast leakage profile across the disruptive BBB. It is conceivable to assume that the changes in 
circulation phase on perfusion-weighted acquisitions may be directly reflected on the status of the endothelial permeability calculations, hence predicting the areas 
of ischemic brain injury at the earlier stage possible.  
Materials and methods 
A longitudinal study in 19 patients with ischemic strokes undergoing at least three times MR follow-up imaging was recruited in this study. All MR conventional 
and T2* perfusion-weighted MR images (TR/TE=1000/44ms, matrix=128× 128, flip angle=90o at 1-second interval with 60-75 dynamic time points) were 
performed on a 1.5T scanner (Magnetom Vision+; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Five of the 19 patients had their MR examinations performed at the acute stage 
(within 6-48 hours); twelve at the early subacute (within 3-4 days); fourteen at the late subacute (within 7-9days); thirteen at the early chronic (within 10-15 days); 
and nine at the late chronic stage within 30-31 days after onset of symptoms, were analyzed for vascular permeability maps using the first-pass pharmacokinetic 
(FPPM) model proposed by Glyn Johnson et., al. [2]. The method used the estimate of vascular contrast medium concentration acquired from normal white matter 
to allow simultaneous mapping of endothelial permeability (Ktrans) and the fractional plasma volume (vp) of brain tissues. A region of interest was placed in the area 
of ischemic lesion with significantly elevated values in Ktrans maps, with contralateral area of normal white matter drawn as the referenced standard to ensure that 
our calculated values are in reasonable agreement with the literatures. The corresponding calculations of vp in the same locations were also measured. 
Results 
Fig. 1. shows the MR examinations of early onset and late chronic stages together with the calculated Ktrans and the vp maps for one patient. vp values of normal 
white matter extracted from FPPM model have an approximate value of 0.01 which is consistent with the literature in the previous studies. The Ktrans map shows 
better contrast between ischemic lesion and normal brain tissues as compared to that of vp map and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CET1WIs). It clearly 
delineates the abnormal area, while the CET1WIs show no significant enhancement at early ischemic stage (Fig. 1A vs. 1C). Both peak values of Ktrans and vp occur 
at the onset of the late subacute state (the 7th day) as shown in Fig. 2.

Discussion and conclusions 
Instead of developing a differential diagnostic tool with a sensitivity superior to the conventional diffusion-weighted MR imaging in detecting acute ischemic stoke, 
the present study was designed to visualize longitudinal infarct changes by assessing the imaging findings using the tracer kinetics. We applied the patients data in 
our institute to confirm that the FPPM model could be an effective means in detecting brain damage in patients with ischemic stroke at the onset of first few days. 
These data suggest that only at the late ischemic phase can a leakage of contrast medium lead to a parenchymal enhancement such that BBB disruption is severe 
enough to be monitored in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, while the abnormal permeability performance can already be clearly found with a higher 
sensitivity to the hemodynamic changes of lesion areas at the acute stage for these patients. The progression of ischemic infarction appears to evolve following a 
similar tendency between the vascular plasma and the permeability calculations with the exception that the opposite sign of slope from the acute stage to the 
subacute one (arrows in Fig.2). With an increasing pattern from acute to late subacute stage, both Ktrans and vp progressively return to a less enhanced contrast at 
late chronic stage (Fig. 2). It maybe postulated that the reduction of blood flow perfusion at this stage gives rise to a pseudo-repaired BBB phenomenon in brain 
infarction. The correlation between measurements of Ktrans and vp can be predicted because K
trans is directly affected not only by endothelial permeability surface 
area product, but also by blood flow perfusion efficiency. Hemorrhage or large area of cortical necrosis was not included in the ROI calculations because the 
poorly perfusion-related signal loss would invalidate the computation of hemodynamic analysis.
