Abstract 
As the improvement of medical technology, aging societies become normal all over the world, 
and that is to say proportion of senior citizens is getting higher. Therefore, medical health care 
becomes the most important topic for study in twenty first century. Among them, home health 
care system including real-time monitoring is the very issue worth to be researched. Here, so- 
called medical real-time healthy monitoring is a system to accurately extract the slight changes  
of important chemical elements in human body because these changes in human body will cause 
serious influence on human health. In this  project, we use the technique correlated with

Many efforts have been developed to chemical 
sensors, such as biosensors and ion sensors, which 
have been made based on the research of novel 
ionophores and devices. 
Based on those research, the light addressable 
potentiometric sensor (LAPS) is one kind of 
potentiometric sensor with silicon substrate.[1] The 
structure of LAPS is similar to an electrolyte 
insulator semiconductor (EIS) structure and the 
signal of LAPS is read out from the photocurrent 
induced by modulated light source. Because of the 
light source, LAPS showed a main advantage 
which is the employment for multi-sensor 
application. 
   In this study, a high-k material, hafnium 
dioxide (HfO2) layer was used as the sensing 
membrane of LAPS. Besides, to improve the 
sensing properties, post deposition annealing (PDA) 
in O2 ambient was processed on HfO2 layers. 
Besides, post CF4 plasma treatment was used with 
expect to get negative monovalence binding on the 
sensing surface and induce to capture the positive 
ions subsequently to improve the sodium sensing 
properties. 
 
2. EXPERIMENT 
Device fabrication 
To investigate the pH sensing properties of 
HfO2 membrane, two different post treatment were 
applicated. To form the buffered layer between 
HfO2 sensing membrane and silicon substrate, 50 
nm-thick silicon dioxide was thermally grown on 
the〈100〉p-type silicon wafer after standard RCA 
clean. For the sensing membrane deposition, HfO2 
layer were fabricated 50 nm by reactive frequency 
(RF) sputter. At first experiment, rapid thermal 
annealing (RTA) for 1 min applied on HfO2 with 
500, 700 and 900℃ in O2 ambient. For pNa 
detection, CF4 plasma treated with the power of 
30W and treatment time was adjusted with 1, 3 and 
5 min under 300℃. Then, a 300 nm-thick Al 
evaporated as the backside electrode and define the 
illuminate area by photolithography process. 
Measurement setup 
An IR-LEDs array was chosen for the light 
source and flashed with 1 kHz ac frequency. The 
mechanical consist of a transimpledance amplifier 
and band-pass filter combined with a multiplexer to 
control the LEDs-array. The result of photocurrent 
for LAPS device was measured by applying a 
dc-bias between solutions and bulk side. Then the 
signal filtered by a narrowband filter afterwards. A 
data acquisition card (DAQ) from NI is used to 
digitize the measurement values. A PC connect 
with DAQ card and control by LabVIEW software 
to calculates controller actions for the CC-mode 
measurement. All LAPS were measured by a 4 
channels setup which was controled by . 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
For the purpose of pH sensitivity evaluation, 
HfO2 LAPS with and without post RTA were 
immersed into pH buffer solution from pH 2 to pH 
12. The trend of pH sensitivity was shown in Fig. 3. 
The pH sensitivity was improved through post 
RTA treatment and it was optimized to 64 mV/pH 
at 700oC but decreased at 900 oC. It could be come 
from the modification of surface roughness.[2]

4. CONCLUSION 
   A novel high-K material was used on pH 
sensing and with high sensitivity and linearity. By 
PDA O2 treatment with different temperature got an 
improvement pH sensitive. After CF4 plasma 
treatment, the pH sensing properties is 
approximately contrast with pNa sensing properties, 
and the final results were listed in Table 1. For the 
multi-ion notion, post CF4 plasma treatment 
provides a more practical idea.

3. Parameters extraction 
The basic concept of differential measurement 
system with LAPS structure is shown in Fig. 2. The 
electron-hole pairs were generated by an IR-LED 
illumination on backside surface of silicon wafer. 
Due to the potential of the sensing surface respect 
to reference electrode, the photocurrent was 
produced depending on the width of the depletion 
layer. The sensitivity is depended on the surface 
interaction with the analyte and form an additional 
potential, which varies the width of the depletion 
layer. The variation of the photo current from two 
electrodes were different and were corresponded to 
the different sensing membrane. 
A differential OP-amplifier was used to amplify 
the differential signal from these two electrodes. 
Due to both photocurrents were generated by one 
IR-LED, the phase shift could be neglected. The 
flat band voltages corresponding to each membrane 
could be measured separately. 
 
 
 
 
4. Results and discussion 
For LAPS structures with each sensing 
membrane, the pH-sensitivity of HfO2 LAPS is 59 
mV/pH as shown in Fig 3(a) and the pH-sensitivity 
of 60% DNP PVC LAPS is 24 mV/pH as shown in 
Fig 3(b). The ideal differential pH-sensitivity 
between these two LAPS structures should be 35 
mV/pH but the real differential pH-sensitivity 
extracted from differential circuit is 30 mV/pH as 
shown in Fig 3(c). The lower pH sensitivity of the 
differential circuit was obtained due to the 
discrepancy of sensing area or superimpose of each 
photo current. To confirm the distinction of the 
signal extracted form these two electrodes of LAPS 
structure, the ground contact or floating contact 
testing were performed. In ground contact testing, 
the signal is extracted form one electrode and the 
other electrode is connected to ground at the same 
time. The results of shifted I-V curves and extracted 
flat-band voltages were shown in Fig 4. In floating 
contact testing, the signal is extracted form one 
electrode and the other electrode is connected to 
ground at the same time. The results of shifted I-V 
curves and extracted flat-band voltages were shown 
in Fig 5. The pH-sensitivity of PVC membrane in 
ground contact testing is 33.4 mV/pH and the 
pH-sensitivity of PVC membrane in floating 
contact testing is 44.5 mV/pH. It is indicated that 
the photocurrent could be easily separated in 
ground contact between both electrodes but the 
photocurrent could be easily affected by another 
electrode in floating contact.
