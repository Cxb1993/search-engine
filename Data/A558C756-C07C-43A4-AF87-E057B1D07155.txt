dielectric for complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits. Among these
dielectrics, Al2O3 is a promising gate insulator due to its excellent low leakage current density,
higher dielectric constant. Many amorphous Al2O3 have been investigated, but a few studies have
been performed on crystalline Al2O3 [1-5]. Al2O3 was investigated as a potentially useful dielectric
material owing to its excellent dielectric properties, which include high dielectric constant and
high-quality factor. In general, the development of microwave dielectric materials for applications
in communication systems, such as cellular phones, wireless local area networks (WLAN), direct
broadcasting satellite (DBS) and the global positioning systems, has been rapidly progressing in the
past decades. Moreover, extension of the carrier frequency from ISM (industrial, scientific and
medical) band to millimeter wave range is expected since the research of ultrahigh-speed
communication system has been undergoing. The unique electrical properties of ceramic dielectric
materials have revolutionized the microwave-based wireless communications industry by reducing
the size and cost of filter and oscillator components in circuit systems. The advantage of using
dielectric resonators is that it makes the size reduction of microwave components possible.
Requirements for these dielectric resonators must be the combined dielectric properties of a high
dielectric constant, a low dielectric loss (Q > 5,000, where tan1Q ) and a near-zero
temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ) [6-8]. Alumina ceramics is well known as the
material for substrates, dielectric resonators and patch antennas. Commercially available alumina
normally has a Q×f value around 100,000-200,000 GHz. With 0.5 wt% TiO2 additions, Alumina
ceramics possesses a quality factor (Q×f) of 450,000 (GHz) at 1500oC for 5 h [9]. Using nano
particle-sized starting material, α-Al2O3 ceramics without additions can be sintered at 1500oC and
promotes its Q×f value to 515,000 GHz [10]. Therefore, using nano particle-sized starting material,
α-Al2O3 ceramics without additions can lower its sintering temperature and promotes its Q×f value
to arrive higher value. Nano particle-sized alpha alumina can thus find many applications in
microwave wireless communication systems such as chip resistor or capacitor in radio frequency
integrated circuit (RFIC). For the next generation of ultra-large scale integrated DRAM, it is widely
pedestals on the floor of the chamber. A diffusion pump was used to evacuate the pressure to 10-6
Torr. A four-channel mass flow controller was used to control the flow rate of Ar.
Alpha alumina film deposition was fabricated by rf magnetron sputtering, as previously
described. All of the films were deposited using Ar at a fixed deposition pressure of 10 mTorr
without any oxygen addition, various substrate temperatures (350, 400, and 450℃) and rf powers
(200, 300, and 400 W). The films were deposited through sputtering for 3 h. The crystalline phases
of alpha alumina film were identified by XRD (Rigaku D/MaxⅢ.Ⅴ) at 30 kV and 20 mA with Cu
Kα radiation. The morphology of the film surface was determined using an atomic force
microscopy (AFM, Digital Instrument DI3000) and scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL40
FE-SEM). The film thickness was also checked by alpha-step (Tencor instrui/MA-1450). Table 1
lists the sputtering parameters in this experiment.
The electrical properties of the alpha alumina thin films were evaluated by
capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurements. The test samples with
metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor structures were prepared on n-type Si substrates.
The sample devices (Pt/Al2O3/Si/Pt) were fabricated by symmetrically depositing Pt electrodes (1
mm in diameter) through shadow mask on both sides of the Al2O3/Si structure. All electrodes were
prepared by using ion sputtering. The C-V and the I-V curves of the MIS capacitors were measured
by using a HP4192 impedance analyzer and a HP4156 parameter analyzer, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of alpha alumina thin films deposited on n-type Si(100)
substrates with (a) different rf powers at a fixed substrate temperatures of 450℃ and (b) various
substrate temperatures at a fixed rf power of 400 W. As observed, the peaks of alumina thin films
(012), (104), (110), (113), (024), and (116) were very distinct. The intensities were enhanced with
increasing rf power and substrate temperature. As the rf power was increased to 400W, the intensity
of the peak of alumina thin films (104) was relatively higher than those of other peaks of alumina
thin films due to higher orientation. It indicates that larger crystal grains are presented in alumina
of the films increased as the substrate temperature decreased. The corresponding rms roughness of
alumina thin fims obtained from AFM images reveals that the surface roughness increased from
6.213 to 8.650 nm as the substrate temperature decreased from 450 to 350℃. In the case of a fixed
substrate temperature of 450℃ and a fixed rf power of 400 W produced a film with a denser
structure and smoother surface.
Fig. 5 plots that the I-V curves of alpha alumina thin films deposited on n-type Si(100)
substrates with (a) different rf powers at a fixed substrate temperatures of 450℃ and (b) various
substrate temperatures at a fixed rf power of 400 W. The curve shows that the alpha alumina thin
films MIS capacitors had a very low leakage current (I ＜ 10-8 A/cm2 at 5 V). The results of
measurements were fit with leakage current density vs. applied voltage. The leakage current density
decreased with increasing rf power and substrate temperature. The leakage current is influenced by
the grain size, the crystallinity, and the surface morphology. The grain boundary structure is denser
and more uniform with increasing rf power and substrate temperature, as shown in Fig. 2.
Increasing the rf power from 200 to 400 W decreased the leakage current from 2.91 × 10-7 to 6.55 ×
10-9 A/cm2 at 5 V, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The decrease in the leakage current with increasing rf
power and substrate temperature is attributed to the decrease of the surface roughness of the alpha
alumina thin films. A similar result was observed by Bhattacharya et al. [12]. A lowest leakage
current density of 6.55 × 10-9 A/cm2 was obtained near applied voltage of 5 V with a fixed substrate
temperature of 450℃ and a fixed rf power of 400 W. Fig. 6 shows the dissipation factor of alpha
alumina thin films with (a) different rf powers at a fixed substrate temperatures of 450℃ and (b)
various substrate temperatures at a fixed rf power of 400 W. As the rf power and the substrate
temperature increased, the dissipation factors decreased due to uniform thin film morphology.
Fig. 7 shows the deposition thickness of alpha alumina thin films with (a) different rf
powers at a fixed substrate temperatures of 450℃ and (b) various substrate temperatures at a fixed
rf power of 400 W. With the rf power varying from 200 to 400 W, the deposition thickness
for the growth of the thin films in this study were a rf power of 400 W, a deposition pressure of 10
mTorr (Ar/O2 = 100/0), a sputtering time of 3 h, and a substrate temperature of 450 ℃. The
dielectric constant of the alpha alumina thin films increased with increasing rf power and substrate
temperature. The MIS structure was introduced in the measurement of C-V and I-V curves for the
alpha alumina thin films. A high dielectric constant of 10.3 (f = 10 MHz), a low leakage current =
6.55 × 10-9 A/cm2 at 5 V with a rf power of 400 W and a fixed substrate temperature of 450℃ for 3
h were obtained for the alpha alumina thin films. Therefore, alpha alumina thin films may be
suggested for application in chip capacitors and chip resistors.
