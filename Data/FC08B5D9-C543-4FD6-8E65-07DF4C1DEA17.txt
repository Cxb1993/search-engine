Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can generally be classified into two categories: time-driven 
and event-driven. In an event-driven WSN, sensors report their readings only when they detect 
events. In such behavior, sensors in the event area may suffer from higher contention. In this 
project, we solved this problem by jointly considering two subissues. One is exploiting the spatial 
correlation of data reported by sensors in the event area and the other is designing a specific 
MAC protocol. We proposed a novel hybrid d TDMA/CSMA protocol with several interesting 
features that make it efficient in data transmission. Because energy efficiency is an important 
issue in WSNs, we also discuss how to combine our protocol with the LPL (Low Power Listening) 
technique to achieve energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the 
proposed protocol.

一、 前言 
無線通訊與感測技術的快速發展使得無線感測網路(Wireless Sensor Network, WSN)成
為一門新興的科技。無線感測網路一般可劃分成兩種類型：以時間驅動(time-driven)為主的
感測網路以及以事件驅動(event-driven)為主的感測網路。在以事件驅動為主的感測網路
中，感測器只有在感測到事件發生時才會回報其所感測到的環境資訊，因此在事件區域
(event area)裡面的感測器容易遭受到較高的競爭與碰撞，因為那些感測器可能同時感測到
事件並同時做回報。為了解決事件區域裡高競爭的問題，本計畫提出了一個結合 TDMA 與
CSMA 的鏈結層協定，實驗結果也證實了其效能。已經有一篇論文在本計畫的補助下發表
於國際期刊 The Computer Journal，此外還有一篇論文正在投稿中。 
 
二、 研究目的 
本研究的目的是要解決以事件驅動為主的感測網路中高競爭傳輸的問題，計畫中所提
出的方法結合了兩個子議題：(1) 利用感測資料的空間相關性(spatial correlation)、(2) 設計
一個特殊的媒介存取控制(Medium Access Control, MAC)協定。本計畫提出了一個結合了
TDMA 與 CSMA 的協定(Protocol)，此協定有幾個有趣的特徵，這些特徵使得所提出的媒介
存取控制協定具有低碰撞、低競爭及低傳送延遲等特性。而由於省電是無線感測網路上一
個很重要的議題，因此在所設計的協定也結合了 LPL (Low Power Listening)[3]的技術來達
到省電的目的。 
 
三、 文獻探討 
 
許多針對無線感測網路而設計的媒介存取控制(MAC)協定已經被提了出來[1-10]。由於
感測器的電源主要是依靠電池，因此省電是一個很重要的議題，在文獻[7]和文獻[9]中，作
者提出一個以省電為主的媒介存取控制協定，分別稱為 S-MAC 與 T-MAC，在這兩個方法
中感測器會有醒來與睡眠的時間，網路上每個感測器會同時的醒來，然後傳送與接收封包，
之後進入睡眠模式，直到下一次需要再度醒來的時間，由於每個感測器需要在同一個時間
醒來，因此同步是需要的。為了消除時間同步所帶來的負擔，文獻[3]提出了 Preamble 
Sampling 的技術來解決同步的問題，亦即想要傳送封包的感測器必須在傳送前送出
Preamble，而聽到 Preamble 的感測器就可維持在清醒模式，根據這樣的想法，文獻[3]提出
了一個媒介存取控制協定，稱為 B-MAC，然而上述三個協定都是屬於以競爭為主
(Contention-based)的協定。在文獻[4]與文獻[10]中，以 TDMA 為主(或稱為以時間排程為主)
的媒介存取控制協定被提出來，這些協定保證無碰撞的傳輸，然而在網路傳輸量不大時，
以 TDMA 為主的協定可能會有較高的傳送延遲(delay)。 
一些結合了 TDMA 與 CSMA 的媒介存取控制協定也被提了出來。在文獻[1]中，一個
局部性(localized)、以資料匯集點為導向(sink-oriented)的媒介存取協定 Funneling-MAC 被提
出，在感測網路中，感測器的資料大多傳送至資料匯集點，因此 Funneling-MAC 是用來解
3 
四、 研究方法 
  
在本節中我們將詳細地敘述本計畫所提出的媒介存取控制協定及相關的實驗結果，本
計畫所提出的方法是假設感測器的底層已經有一個以 CSMA 為基礎的媒介存取控制協
定，而為了要解決事件發生區域(event are)所可能面臨的高競爭、高碰撞，在鏈結層設計
了一個以 TDMA 為基礎的排程機制，必須要說明的是，在非事件發生區域的感測器並非
都要幫忙轉送回報封包，若採用排程機制，只會造成傳送的延遲（時間的浪費），因此那
些感測器最好是採用原始底層的 CSMA 協定，所以在本計畫所提出的方法中，我們假設
感測器可能處在兩種模式的一種，這兩種模式分別為 ES (event-source)模式與 NES 
(non-event-source)模式，當感測網路剛佈置好時，所有的感測器皆處於 NES 模式，在 NES
模式下的感測器會採用底層的 CSMA 來傳輸。而當一個感測器 x 偵測到事件的時候，感
測器 x 會進入 ES 模式，在 ES 模式的感測器會採用以 TDMA 為基礎的排程方法來做回報，
在 ES 模式裏有幾個議題是必須要討論的：(1) 何時進入 ES 模式，(2) 如何根據事件驅動
感測網路的特性，設計一個好的時槽(slot assignment)分配策略，(3) 如何決定一個適當的
時槽大小，(4) 會造成同步錯誤的原因有哪些，如何做好時間的同步，(5) 如何利用感測
資料的空間相關性來降低多餘的回報，(6) 何時可離開 ES 模式。接下來我們便針對上述
幾個議題做詳細的描述。 
¾ 進入ES模式的時機與方法 
首先，SC-MAC（即本計畫書所提出的方法）會將時間切割成許多的時槽(slot)，
當一個感測網路被佈置時，一個時槽分配演算法會被執行（演算法會於稍後做說明），
因此每個感測器會被分配到一個時槽，時槽的編號是從 1 到MAXSLOT（亦即一個循
環有MAXSLOT個時槽），SC-MAC最特別的地方是，時槽的啟動是由事件來驅動的，
亦即，一開始每個感測器會處於NES模式，當一個感測器偵測到事件時，這個感測器
就會進入ES模式並啟動第一個時槽，也就是時槽1 （在SC-MAC中，一個感測器不需
要跟別的感測器報知它啟動了時槽1，因為若有多個感測器同時偵測到事件的發生，則
它們自動地同時啟動時槽1，亦即自動地達到同步，然而若有事件漫延而產生的時間延
遲，稍後也會提出一個簡單的同步修正演算法），在啟動時槽1之後，這個感測器便會
開始計算時槽數，當這個感測器被分配到的時槽來到的時候，且它認為它還是需要做
回報（有時它發現可能回報數已經足夠了，可放棄回報），那麼它就會利用底層採用的
CSMA媒介存取控制協定，將回報傳送至網路上。 
 
¾ 時槽分配演算法 (Slot Assignment Algorithm) 
傳統以TDMA排程為基礎的協定都會分配給每個節點一個時槽(slot)，那個時槽會
不同於那個節點的one-hop鄰居以及two-hop鄰居，當將感測資料的空間相關性考量進去
時，這樣的分配會變得沒有效率，因為如果有一個節點最後決定不做回報的動作，那
麼分配給它的時槽就會造成浪費，因此SC-MAC需要提出了一個新的時槽分配演算
法。由於SC-MAC是建構在一個底層為CSMA的協定之上（嚴格地說，SC-MAC是一個
鏈結層協定，而非一個媒介存取控制協定），因此即使分配同一個時槽給兩個相鄰的節
點也並不一定會造成碰撞的發生，當鄰近的節點都想做回報且共享同一個時槽時，
5 
在傳統的TDMA中，精準的時間同步(time synchronization)是需要的，然而在
SC-MAC中精準的時間同步是不需要的，主要有兩個理由，第一是SC-MAC的底層是一
個CSMA為基礎的協定，因此後退機制(backoff mechanism)以及CCA(Clear Channel 
Assessment)機制能夠適當地解決因為同步錯誤而造成的碰撞，第二個理由是SC-MAC
中時槽會刻意地被增長，這樣的設計也可讓SC-MAC容忍某些程度的時間不同步。 
 
在SC-MAC中，感測器會因為事件的發生而同時進入ES模式進而達到同步，然而
這樣的機制可能會有兩個問題造成同步的錯誤： 
z 事件漫延所產生的時間延遲(event propagation delay)，進而造成感測到事件的眾多
感測器並沒有同時進入ES模式。 
z 多重事件發生時間與發生地點很接近時，有些感測器可能會同時偵測到複數個事
件，進而造成時間的同步錯誤。這是因為在SC-MAC中，當一個感測器進入ES模
式後，如果又偵測到另外一個事件，此感測器並不會從時槽編號1重新計算，而是
選擇遵從舊事件繼續地計算，另一方面，有一些感測器可能並沒有感測到舊事件
而只有感測到新事件，那些感測器會從時槽1開始計算，因此就會發生同步錯誤。 
為了要解決這兩個問題，我們提出了一個簡單的時間調整機制，詳細  
 
¾ 利用感測資料的空間相關性與排程機制來降低回報數的方法 
到目前為止，主要將焦點放在媒介存取這個子議題上，接下來，將把重心放在第
二個子議題，即討論如何利用感測資料的空間相關性來降低回報數，跟CC-MAC一下，
假設系統會給定一個關聯半徑(correlation radius, Rcorr) ，本小節的目標是要降低多餘的
回報數。本計畫書所提出的回報數降低機制有兩個優點，第一是利用了TDMA的特徵，
設計了一個機率來降低回報數，此方法完全不依靠偷聽(overhear)，第二是跟CC-MAC
比較起來，在SC-MAC中，當一個感測器偷聽到一個封包，重疊(overlap)的關聯區域大
小會被考量進去。 
SC-MAC中所提出的回報降低機制總共包含了三個步驟，第一個步驟是發生在感
測器感測到一個事件時執行，感測器會採用一個機率來決定它是否需要回報（要注意
的是，即使一個感測器選擇放棄回報，它仍然會進入ES模式，因為它可能需要幫忙轉
送封包），接著它就開始進入第二個步驟，在此步驟中，感測器會試著去偷聽其它感
測器的封包直到它的時槽編號到來，最後當它的時槽編號到達時，它就會進入第三個
步驟，在此步驟中，如果感測器的傳送緩衝區(buffer)有封包要傳送，它就會將封包送
出，接下來就詳細地介紹此三個步驟。 
步驟一. 由於偷聽(overhearing)是屬於隨機的(opportunistic)甚至有時是不可能的，因此
對於一個感測器而言，很難收集足夠的資訊來判斷倒底要不要回報，因此在步驟
一中採用了一個機率來幫助感測器決定，而不倚靠偷聽。在SC-MAC中，當一個
感測器偵測到事件，它會採用一個機率 ，期中0 < α ≤ 1，S則為感測器被分配
到的時槽編號，這樣的設計表示時槽編號大的感測器可能會傾向於不回報，這是
因為時槽編號大的時槽其鄰居可能已經做完回報了（注意在此步驟中完全不需要
偷聽的幫助）。有一個問題是，如此的設計會不會造成能量消耗不平衡(unbalance)
的問題，其實一個時槽編號大的感測器即使不回報也很有機會需要幫忙轉送其它
感測器的回報封包，因此不平衡問題不至於太嚴重，此外也可藉著重新執行時槽

實驗結果與討論 
  
 為了證實所提出方法的效能，在本計畫的執行過程中，我們開發了一個模擬器，我們
假設有4096個感測器佈置於感測區域內，我們並提出了一個事件產生模型(event generation 
model)去模擬事件的發生，此外為了證實我們所提出的鬆散的同步機制(loose 
synchronization scheme)，我們也模擬了事件的擴散與複數事件同時發生的情況。 
 在模擬實驗中，我們所提出的SC-MAC (a MAC protocol with Spatial Correlation 
consideration)會和幾個方法做比較，第一個方法是純粹的CSMA，在這個方法中沒有任何的
空間相關性被考量，第二個方法是CSMA-CCA (a CSMA-based protocol with Simple Spatial 
Correlation consideration)，在這個方法中會適度地考量空間相關性把多餘的傳送去除掉，去
除多餘封包的方法是跟CC-MAC[2]一樣的，第三個方法是SCMAC-SCC-TSA，這個方法採
用CC-MAC所提出的方法去除多餘封包，並採用了我們所提出的排程方法，然而時槽的安
排是採用傳統TDMA的方式，亦即一個節點不會和其鄰居使用相同的時槽，第四個方法是
SCMAC-TSA，多餘封包的去除是採用我們所提出的機制，然而時槽的分配是採用傳統的
TDMA方式，最後第五個方法SCMAC-SSC，採用了CC-MAC所提出的方法去除多餘封包，
其它如時槽的安排等都與SCMAC相同。 
 圖二顯示了一個當Rcorr大於Rtran時的實驗結果，首先我們來看CSMA與CSMA-SSC這兩
個機制，雖然他們在延遲時間的比現很好(代表封包很快地就可以傳送到Sink)，但是在其它
方面就表現得很差，這是因為事件區域內的高競爭與高碰撞使得Sink只能接收到少數的封
包，這點可從圖二(b)中獲得證實，CSMA和CSMA-SCC的封包成功傳送率很低。

Exploiting Spatial Correlation at the Link Layer for Event-driven Sensor Networks 1
Exploiting Spatial Correlation at the Link Layer for
Event-driven Sensor Networks
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can generally be classified into two categories: time-
driven and event-driven. In an event-driven WSN, sensors report their readings only when they
detect events. In such behavior, sensors in the event area may suffer from higher contention. In this
paper, we solve this problem by jointly considering two subissues. One is exploiting the spatial
correlation of data reported by sensors in the event area and the other is designing a specific
MAC protocol. We propose a novel hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol with the following interesting
features that differentiate itself from traditional TDMA-based protocols: (1) the TDMA part is
based on very loose time synchronization and is triggered by the appearance of events. (2) the
slot assignment strategy associated with the TDMA part takes the spatial correlation of sensor data
into consideration and thus allows less strict slot allocation than conventional TDMA schemes.
Interestingly, by intentionally allowing one-hop neighbors to share the same time slot, the number
of slots required is significantly reduced. (3) by intentionally enlarging the slot size, packets will be
separated sufficiently in distance to avoid interference after leaving the event area. In addition, we
also discuss how to combine our protocol with the LPL (Low Power Listening) technique to achieve
energy efficiency. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed protocol.
Keywords: wireless sensor network; medium access control; TDMA; CSMA; spatial correlation.
1 Introduction
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can generally be classified
into two categories: time-driven and event-driven. In a time-
driven WSN, sensors report their sensed data to the sink
periodically. Such reporting behavior is typically predictable
and involves all sensors in the WSN. Thus, such reporting
behavior usually exhibits a unique funneling effect (Ahn
et al., 2006), where sensors near the sink may suffer from
higher contention. Several approaches have been developed
to relieve such contention (Ahn et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2005).
Some convergecast or scheduling schemes have also been
proposed to provide collision-free transmission for this type
of communications (Hohlt et al., 2004; Pan and Tseng, 2008).
On the contrary, in an event-driven WSN, sensors report
only when they detect events. The occurrence of events is
unpredictable and spontaneous in terms of time and space.
Thus, traffics near the sink may not be heavy, but sensors in
the event area may suffer from higher contention, because
they are likely to detect, and thus intend to report, events
simultaneously.
Our goal in this work is to solve the contention problem
of event reporting in event-driven WSNs. The proposed
approach joints two subissues. One is exploiting the spatial
correlation of data reported by sensors in the event area and
the other is designing a specific MAC protocol. Due to the
spatial correlation of sensor data, nearby sensors typically
have similar values. Thus, it may not be necessary for every
sensor to report its sensed data. For example, in Fig. 1(a),
the cloud area denotes the event area, and each sensor x
is associated with a correlation region, in which sensors’
readings are highly correlated with x. We can see that it is
sufficient to have sensors a, b, c, and d to report to cover the
event area. In addition, we can also note that the selection of
reporting sensors needs to be done carefully. For example, in
Fig. 1(b), the five gray sensors are insufficient to cover the
whole event area. Exploiting the spatial correlation of sensor
data to reduce redundant reports has been studied by Pattem
et al. (2004); Pradhan et al. (2002); Scaglione and Servetto
(2005); Vuran and Akyildiz (2006); Yoon and Shahabi (2005)
and so on.
The second subissue is to design a specific MAC protocol.
After reporting sensors are selected, we need to reduce
the contention and collision among these reporting packets
and to minimize the latency in transmitting these packets.
Contention and collision are likely because these sensors
may be close to each other. In addition, because packets in
WSNs are typically small, using the RTS/CTS mechanism
to avoid the hidden terminal problem is not preferred. Thus,
the collision problem becomes more severe without the aid
of RTS/CTS. Besides, since these packets are likely to share
common paths when moving toward the sink, we would like
to see that packets are separated spatially (e.g., Fig. 1(a)),
rather than close to each other (e.g., Fig. 1(b)), along these
paths to avoid collision. Thus, designing a specific MAC
protocol for event-driven WSNs is required.
Exploiting the spatial correlation of sensor data at the
MAC layer has been discussed by Vuran and Akyildiz
(2006), where the relation between the spatial positions of
sensors and the event estimation reliability is investigated.
Specifically, a distortion function is derived and a term
correlation radius (Rcorr) is introduced. Then, CC-MAC
(spatial Correlation-based Collaborative Medium Access
Control) is proposed. CC-MAC consists of two components:
E-MAC (Event MAC) and N-MAC (Network MAC). E-MAC
aims to filter out correlated reporting (i.e., determine which
sensors can report). On the other hand, N-MAC is mainly
used for sensors not in the event area to forward reporting
packets. However, CC-MAC has the following drawbacks:
(i) E-MAC is a purely contention-based protocol. Although
some sensors may withdraw from reporting, those sensors
that decide to report will still cause a lot of contention,
Exploiting Spatial Correlation at the Link Layer for Event-driven Sensor Networks 3
severe near the event areas than the sink area. Rhee et al.
(2008) have proposed Z-MAC in which sensors in the low-
contention areas will adopt a CSMA-based MAC protocol
and those in the high-contention areas will adopt a TDMA-
based MAC protocol. Thus, Z-MAC takes the advantages
of low latency of CSMA and high channel utilization of
TDMA. However, when applying Z-MAC to an event-driven
WSN,sensors need time to switch their modes when they
detect an event. In addition, Z-MAC does not take the spatial
correlation of sensor data into consideration.
Some MAC protocols have been proposed for event-
driven WSNs. Jamieson et al. (2006) have proposed a backoff
probability distribution to minimize the time taken to send
R < N of reports without collision when N nodes detect
an event. The drawback is that the topology is assumed
to be single-hop. In addition, the issue of the quality of
data (e.g., distortion or reconstruction performance) is not
addressed. Dong et al. (2004) and Dong et al. (2006)
have investigated the impact of the MAC design on the
reconstruction performance of the signal. The authors show
that the benefit from carefully scheduling transmission is
substantial in the high SNR regime. On the contrary, in
the low SNR regime, using the random access MAC is
sufficient. This gives a hint that a hybrid TDMA/CSMA
MAC protocol may be required. Unfortunately, no concrete
MAC protocol is proposed by Dong et al. (2004) and Dong
et al. (2006). Zhao et al. (2007a) have proposed a contention-
based protocol called QS-SIFT in which sensors with high
SNR have higher priority than those with low SNR when
contending for the shared channel. Vuran and Akyildiz (2006)
have proposed a MAC protocol called CC-MAC. CC-MAC is
a contention-based MAC protocol and does not take SNR into
consideration. We have introduced CC-MAC and described
its drawbacks in Sec. 1.
Zhao et al. (2007b) have proposed a hybrid
TDMA/CSMA MAC protocol that takes the spatial
correlation into consideration. In the proposed scheme,
CSMA is integrated with TDMA while filtering out the
spatial correlation. The event area is divided into three
sub-areas: outer area, middle area and inner area. Nodes in
the outer area sleep most of the time. Nodes in the middle
area will be assigned different priority based on their SNR.
Nodes in the inner area will adopt a schedule-based scheme.
However, this protocol has one major drawback. That is,
positioning technique is required to help a node to identify
the region that it belongs. In our scheme, only the distance
information is required to exploit the spatial correlation of
sensor data.
3 Some Observations
Due to small packet size, adopting RTS/CTS is not preferred
in WSNs. In this section, we assume that a CSMA-based
MAC protocol is adopted in which the RTS/CTS mechanism
is disabled. In order to motivate our work, we make some
observations from the interference and the spatial correlation
aspects.
From the interference aspect, we raise two scenarios to
show that the hidden terminal problem will be very serious in
an event-driven WSN. First, as shown in Fig. 2(a), when two
sensors that are two-hops apart detect an event at the same
time, their reports may collide even though their receivers
are different. Second, even for sensors not in the event area,
collisions are inevitable as packets move toward the sink.
Fig. 2(b) shows an example with a report tree. We assume
that two reports are sent out. Packet 1, Packet 3 and
Packet 5 belong to the first report and Packet 2, Packet 4
and Packet 6 belong to the second report. Without the aid
of RTS/CTS, we can see that Packet 1 could collide with
Packet 2 at sensor D, Packet 3 and Packet 4 could collide
at sensor G, and Packet 5 could collide with Packet 6 at
sensor I . Thus, the interference is serious for sensors in the
event area, as well as those far away from the event area.
We can see that designing a MAC protocol for event-driven
WSNs without RTS/CTS is a challenging problem.
From the spatial correlation aspect, we argue that using
inter-distance between sensors is insufficient to decide who
shall report. A simple example is illustrated in Fig. 3(a),
where sensor y is near the boundary of sensor x’s correlation
region. In CC-MAC (Vuran and Akyildiz, 2006), y has to
report no matter whether it overhears x’s report or not. We
can see that the overlap area of x’s and y’s correlation regions
is about 39% of one correlation region, which is high. A
more sophisticated example is further shown in Fig. 3(b).
Assuming that sensors a, b, c, and x have already reported,
we consider two scenarios. First, if y does not overhear any
of those reports (we can see that y is not in any of the
transmission regions of a, b, c, and x), then y will report.
However, y’s report does not contribute any additional area
to existing reports. Second, even if y can overhear x’s report
(this is possible when f forwards x’s report), CC-MAC
will enforce y to report, because the distance between x
and y is larger than Rcorr. Therefore, a more sophisticated
report reduction scheme is desirable. In addition, because
overhearing is opportunistic sometimes, the report reduction
scheme should not highly rely on overhearing.
4 The Proposed Schedule-based Approach
4.1 Overview
We assume that a CSMA-based MAC protocol is adopted as
the underlying MAC protocol. In order to solve the contention
problem and the hidden terminal problem in the event areas,
a schedule-based (or a TDMA-like) approach is proposed.
However, for those sensors not in the event areas, because
not all sensors need to help forward packets, assigning slots
to those sensors that do not intend to transmit any packet is
unnecessary and could increase delay. This means that the
TDMA-like approach may not be suitable for sensors not
in the event areas. Instead, they will take a CSMA-based
approach. Therefore, our scheme can be regarded as a hybrid
TDMA/CSMA protocol.
Each node has two modes: event-source (ES) mode and
non-event-source (NES) mode. Sensors in the NES mode will

Figure 4 Comparison of slot assignment strategies.
4.2.2 Slot Assignment Strategy
In order to reduce the value of MAXSLOT, we need a good
slot assignment scheme rather than assigning slots randomly
based on the IDs of nodes. Conventional TDMA-based
protocols will assign each node a slot different from those
of its one-hop and two-hop neighbors to avoid interference.
We argue that when the spatial correlation of sensor data is
taken into consideration, such a strategy may not be efficient,
because not every sensor needs to report. It is easy to see
that if a node finally decides not to report, then the slot
assigned to it will be wasted. Thus, we propose a new slot
assignment strategy. Recall that our TDMA-like protocol is
built on top of a CSMA-based protocol. Thus, assigning the
same slot to neighboring nodes does not necessarily lead
to collision. When neighboring nodes intend to report and
share the same slot, the backoff mechanism can be used
to determine who can report and the losers may suspend
their reports due to the spatial correlation of sensor data
when they overhear the packet sent by the winner. Therefore,
we intentionally assign a slot used by a node’s one-hop
neighbors to that node, but the node still should be assigned
a slot different from those used by its two-hop neighbors
to avoid the hidden terminal problem (recall that we do
not adopt the RTS/CST mechanism). Another advantage of
our proposed slot assignment strategy is that the value of
MAXSLOT required can be reduced significantly.
To verify the efficiency of the proposed slot assignment
strategy, a simple simulation is conducted. 4096 sensors
are randomly deployed in a 256× 256 field with uniform
distribution. As we can see in Fig. 4, when the transmission
range of senors increases, the value of MAXSLOT increases
from 45 to 301 when a node needs to have a slot different
from those used by its one-hop and two-hop neighbors. (Note
that our slot assignment algorithm that will be described later
can be easily modified to support this strategy.) However, the
value of MAXSLOT only increases from 14 to 23 when a
sensor only needs to differentiate from its two-hop neighbors.
Note that a lower MAXSLOT means a lower report latency.
We develop a simple distributed slot assignment algorithm
to complement this slot assignment strategy. We make some
assumptions. First, the network topology is static. Second,
each sensor has a unique ID. Third, each sensor can correctly
discover all its one-hop and two-hop neighbors. Finally, the
number of two-hop neighbors of a node is finite.
Each sensor will maintain a slot usage table to record the
slots used by its one-hop and two-hop neighbors. Each sensor
that does not own a slot will select its slot in a distributed way.
Thus, we only describe the behavior of a sensor x. First, xwill
send a request to all of its two-hop neighbors. Any two-hop
neighbor y of x receiving the request will act as follows.
• If y does not own a slot yet and y.ID < x.ID, then y
will reply a grant to x. Because y does not own a slot
yet, no slot information will be carried on the grant.
• Otherwise, y will do nothing.
Once x receives grants from all of its two-hop neighbors, x
will select a slot by the following rule. To begin with, x will
check whether there exists a slot such that this slot has been
assigned to x’s one-hop neighbors but has not been assigned
to x’s two-hop neighbors. If such slots exist, x will pick up
the most-used one among those slots. (Recall that we will
intentionally assign a slot used by a node’s one-hop neighbors
to that node.) Otherwise, x will select the smallest slot that
has not been used by its two-hop neighbors. (The reason is to
minimize MAXSLOT.) After selecting its own slot, xwill send
a grantwith its selected slot to each of its two-hop neighbors.
(Note that this grant has two functions. The first one is to
enforce x’s one-hop and two-hop neighbors to modify their
slot usage table. The second one is to make x’s two-hop
neighbors get the needed grants.) Then, when another node z
which may be x’s one-hop or two-hop neighbor receives such
a grant on which a selected slot is carried, z will modify its
slot usage table accordingly and check whether it has received
all grants from all of its two-hop neighbors.
Finally, when a sensor determines its slot, it will notify the
sink so that the sink can determine the value of MAXSLOT.
Then the sink will announce MAXSLOT to all sensors. Note
that when no packet loss occurs, the proposed slot assignment
algorithm guarantees that each node will receive grants from
all of its two-hop neighbors. However, when packet loss
cannot be avoided, a sensor may loss grants and this will
result in deadlock. In order to overcome the packet loss
problem, a sensor can actively ask its two-hop neighbors to
resend their grants (if allowed) when it waits passively for a
long period.
Note that the proposed slot assignment algorithm is
run only once when sensors are first deployed. However,
sometimes it will be rerun for some reasons such as topology
change, load balance, and so on. We assume that the
frequency of rerunning the slot assignment algorithm is low
so that we can ignore the cost paid for slot assignment.
Theorem 1: The proposed slot assignment algorithm
ensures that each sensor will eventually select a slot different
from those used by its two-hop neighbors.
Proof: For simplicity, we assume that packet loss will not
occur. Because each sensor has the same behavior, we only
consider a sensor, say x. We assume that x has n two-hop
Exploiting Spatial Correlation at the Link Layer for Event-driven Sensor Networks 7
TDMA-like protocol is built on top of a CSMA-based MAC
protocol. This means that the backoff scheme and the CCA
(Clear Channel Assessment) scheme can remove most of the
collisions caused by synchronization error.
In our scheme, sensors are assumed to be synchronized
by the occurrence of events, which trigger them to enter the
ES mode. This scheme has two problems that may lead to
synchronization error.
• Sensors may not enter ES-Mode simultaneously due to the
event propagation delay.
• When multiple events occur close in time and space, some
sensors may detect multiple events. In our scheme, when a
sensor in the ES mode detects another event, we will allow
it to continue its slot counting, instead of resetting to slot 1.
On the contrary, some sensor may only detect one event and
enter slot 1. This will also lead to synchronization error.
In our scheme, we do not consider the synchronization
error caused by the event propagation delay, because the
backoff and CCA mechanisms can alleviate the collision
problem. For the multi-event problem, we propose a simple
adjustment scheme. We assume that each sensor will count
how many slots have passed after it entered the ES mode.
This counter is denoted by s. When a sensor x transmits a
packet in the ES mode, the counter x.s will be carried in the
packet. Each of x’s neighbor sensors, say y, that overhears
the packet will react as follows. (Note that when y receives
the packet, it can easily know the packet is transmitted by x
in the ((x.s− 1)(mod MAXSLOT) + 1)-th slot of a cycle.)
• If y.s >= x.s, then y will do nothing.
• If y.s < x.s, then y will adjust its current slot to ((x.s−
1)(mod MAXSLOT) + 1), and set y.s to x.s.
With our adjustment scheme, when multiple events
occur close in time and space, the sensors that detect the
earliest event will dominate the clock in the ES mode.
Although collisions could occur during the adjusting, the
backoff and CCA mechanisms and the design of longer
slot size can alleviate the collision problem. With this loose
synchronization scheme, our scheme can handle the multi-
event problem easily.
Finally, one should note that we cannot use the slot
number assigned to sensors to correct the synchronization
error. For example, in Fig. 6, when B overhears the packet
transmitted by A, it will switch to slot 10. Later on, when B
overhears the packet transmitted by C, it will switch back to
slot 9. Thus, the counters rather than the slot number should
be used in the adjustment scheme.
4.2.5 Exploiting the Spatial Correlation of Sensor
Data
So far, we mainly focus on the medium access issue. Next,
we discuss how to exploit the spatial correlation of sensor
data. We assume that a correlation radius Rcorr is given
by applications and our goal is to minimize redundant
reports under distortion constraints. We propose a report
reduction scheme that provides two advantages. First, by
exploiting TDMA’s features, we adopt a probability to reduce
redundant reports without the aid of overhearing. Second,
compared to CC-MAC, when a sensor overhears a packet,
the area of the overlap of correlation regions will be taken
into consideration. (Note that a report reduction scheme
is required, especially when Rcorr > Rtran, because the
number of sensors should be large enough to ensure network
connectivity and most of them do not need to report.)
Our report reduction scheme consists of three steps. The
first step is executed when a sensor detects an event. The
sensor will use a probability to determine whether it should
report or not (note that if the sensor decides not to report,
it still needs to enter the ES mode). Then, it will enter the
second step, during which it will try to overhear others’
packets before its slot arrives. With overhearing, some reports
can be further discarded in this step. Finally, when the
sensor’s slot arrives, it will enter the third step in which it will
transmit one of the packets in its buffer, if any. The details of
this scheme are described as follows.
Step 1: Because overhearing is opportunistic or even
impossible sometimes, it is hard for a sensor to collect enough
information to judge whether it should report or not. Thus, a
probability is adopted to help sensors to decide whether they
should report or not. In our scheme, when a sensor detects
an event, it will report this event with a probability αS−1,
where 0 < α ≤ 1 and S is the slot number assigned to that
sensor. This means that a sensor with larger slot number may
tend to not report. To motivate this design, let’s reconsider the
example shown in Fig. 3(b), where we assume that sensors
a, b, c, and x have already reported, but sensor y does not
report yet, because y’s slot number is larger than the others.
Recall that we have shown that y’s report is redundant. Based
on this observation, sensors with larger slot number should
tend to not report, because their neighbors may have reported.
Note that this step can reduce redundant reports without the
aid of overhearing. Note that a sensor with larger slot number
needs to help forward reports generated by others; thus, the
unbalance problem in terms of energy consumption will not
be serious.
An issue is determining a proper α, which is affected by
many factors, for example, the ratio of Rcorr to Rtran and
network density. It is a challenge to determine an optimal
α. To simplify this problem, we suggest that α should be
an adjustable parameter so that the sink can adjust the
value of α based on the received reports. Given a distortion
constraint, when the sink receives many redundant reports, it
can decrease the value of α and announce the new value of
α to sensors. (Note that although the sink cannot know the
exact boundary of event area, it can compute the overlap area
of correlation regions to judge the redundancy level based on
Rcorr and the locations of reporting sensors.) Besides, when
the distortion is the major concern, the sink can just set α =
1.
Step 2: Then, we describe the second step. To begin with,
we define the reporter of a packet. The reporter of a packet
is the sensor that first initiates this report packet by detecting

5 Simulation Results
We have developed a simulator to demonstrate the efficiency
of our proposed approach. A sensing field with size 256×
256 units where 4096 sensors are deployed randomly with
uniform distribution is simulated. The sensor with ID 0 is
selected to be the sink. An event generation model used to
simulate the events arising in the network is proposed. In
order to verify the proposed loose synchronization scheme,
we assume that the event could spread and multiple events
could occur simultaneously. In this model, we use four
parameters to control the generation of events:
• MAX INTERVAL: This parameter defines the maximum
time interval between two events.
• WIDTH and MAX LEVEL: In our model, an event area is
represented by multiple concentric circles. The number of
concentric circles is determined by MAX LEVEL. The first
circle is the one with radius WIDTH, the second circle is the
one with radius 2×WIDTH, and so on.
• PROPAGATION DELAY: This parameter is used to simulate
the event propagation delay. When an event occurs, if sensors
in the i-th annulus of the event area detect this event at ti,
then sensors in the i+ 1-th annulus will detect this event at
ti + PROPAGATION DELAY.
Now, we describe the procedure of this event generation
model. The first event will be triggered at the beginning
of simulation. As we mentioned above, an event area is
represented by multiple concentric circles. Therefore, a point
in the sending field will be selected randomly as the center
of those circles. Sensors in the first circle will detect this
event first. Then, after PROPAGATION DELAY, sensors in
the second annulus will also detect this event. This detection
procedure will continue until sensors in the MAX LEVEL-
th annulus detect this event. Finally, when an event ej
arises initially, the next event (i.e., event ej+1) will also be
triggered after t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ MAX INTERVAL and t is
determined randomly with uniform distribution. Note that
when PROPAGATION DELAY is equal to zero, this means
that the event will not spread, and when t is zero, this means
that two events will occur at the same time.
Three metrics are used to evaluate the performance
of medium access schemes. We count the number of

packets transmitted. Usually, fewer packets means that
sensors can stay in sleep mode longer. Thus, less energy
is consumed. We also measure the success rate of packet
transmission defined as the ratio of the number of packets
received by the intended receiver to the number of packets
transmitted by the sender. Success rate can be used to
evaluate the efficiency of a MAC protocol. Higher success
rate means less collision. Average delay is defined as
the average delay of packets sent by ES mode sensors
and received by the sink. Besides, two metrics are used
to evaluate the performance of report reduction schemes.
Coverage is defined as Acorr reg union/Aevent area, where
Acorr reg union denotes the area of the field united by the
correlation regions of reporters whose reports are received by
the sink, and Aevent area is the area of event area. Higher
coverage means that the sink has more accurate information
regarding events. Finally, for an unit area in the event area, if
it is covered by n sensors’ correlation regions, where n > 1,
then we define that the redundancy of that unit area is (n−
1)× 100%.
In Sec. 5.1, we compare our proposed schedule-based
approach with a CSMA-based protocol. Also, two report
reduction schemes and two slot assignment schemes will
be applied separately. The detail will be described later. In
Sec. 5.2, we further investigate the impact of two parameters
used in our proposed approach, that is, α and `. The related
parameters and their default values used in the simulation are
shown in Table 1.

results where N1/N2 denotes that Rcorr is N1 units and
Rtran is N2 units. From Fig. 10(a), we can see that when
the ratio of Rcorr to Rtran increases from 1.0 to 2.0, we
can use lower α to achieve enough coverage. The reason is
that when Rcorr/Rtran becomes larger, the probability that
two sensors that are within each other’s correlation region
and cannot overhear each other’s packets directly becomes
larger. Thus, the value of α should be small in order to reduce
redundant packets. Then, we can note that whenRcorr/Rtran
is fixed, larger Rtran can lead to better coverage, because
more sensors can overhear the reports. This also implies that
a smaller value of α should be used when the network density
is large. However, from Fig. 10(b), we observe that when the
Rtran becomes larger, the redundancy is high even a small
value of α is used. Thus, we suggest that Rtran should not

Fig. 1. (a) An example of boundaries and quads, where Quad(l, i) denotes
the i-th level-l quad. (b) An example of the basic operation of the quadtree-
based location management scheme.
So far, the quadtree-based structure and the update operation
have been briefly described. The remaining issue is the query
operation. A query can be issued from anywhere and the query
will be forwarded to the level-1 leader first. Because update
packets will be sent to the level-1 leader when objects cross
the level-1 boundary, the level-1 leader can easily know that it
should forward the query to which level-2 leader. For example,
in Fig. 1(b), the level-1 leader knew that it should forward the
query to Quad(2, 1) at t0 and t1 because the level-1 leader
only received one update packet after the object entered the
sensing field at t0 and t1. The level-1 leader will receive
another update packet when the object crosses the level-1
boundary from Quad(2, 1) to Quad(2, 2). Thus, at t2, the
level-1 leader can know that it should forward the query to the
level-2 leader of Quad(2, 2) rather than to the level-2 leader
of Quad(2, 1) so as to get more precise location information.
When a level-2 leader receives the query from the level-1
leader, there are two cases that should be discussed. In the first
case, the level-2 leader does not have any location information
of the queried object. For example, in Fig. 1(b), the leader of
Quad(2, 1) did not have any location information of the car
at t0, because the car did not cross the level-2 boundary of
Quad(2, 1) yet. Thus, the leader with lower level value should
embed the latest location information in the query so that the
next leader can know how to process the query. For example,
at t0, the leader of Quad(2, 1) knew that the car was located
in Quad(3, 1) by the latest location information of the object
embedded by the level-1 leader. In the second case, the level-2
leader has the location information of the queried object. For
example, when the object crosses the level-2 boundary from
Quad(3, 1) to Quad(3, 2), an update packet will be sent to the
leader of Quad(2, 1) so that the leader of Quad(2, 1) knows
that it should forward the query to the leader of Quad(3, 2)
so as to get more precise location information. Then, the same
rules can be applied to the level-3 leaders, and so forth. (Note
that a query will be forwarded to the next leader only when
the next leader is available.)
III. THE QUADTREE-BASED LOCATION MANAGEMENT
SCHEME
A. Update Operation
Now, the details of the update operation will be presented.
To begin with, Level(v) will be defined. If a sensor v is on
level-i boundary, then Level(v) = i. If a sensor v is not on
any boundary, then Level(v) = MAX LEV EL + 1, where
MAX LEV EL is the maximum level value in the network.
(Note that the value of MAX LEV EL can be known after
the boundary construction process.) Besides, it is assumed that
each leader, say x, will maintain an object list, which records
the latest information of the objects known by x. Each entry
of x’s object list can be represented as < o, loc, rec time >,
where o is the ID of the recorded object, loc is the latest
location of o known by x, and rec time is the time at which o
was located at loc. When a leader receives an update message,
it will update its object list accordingly.
When an object o moves from sensor a to sensor b, the
sensors will act as follows. (Note that an update message
can be represented as Update(o, loc, rec time), where loc is
the latest location of o known by the sensor that detects the
movement event, and rec time denotes the time at which the
sensor detects the event.)
• If Level(a) < Level(b), then sensor a will send an
update message Update(o, loc, rec time) to its leader
(By doing so, when a’s leader receives a query, it can
know that it should forward the query to which level-
(Level(a) + 1) leader based on loc carried in the update

Fig. 2. Performance comparison between the traditional tree-based scheme
and the quadtree-based scheme under different query rates. The average speed
of objects is 1 unit/second.
(due to the deviation-free property of the DAT scheme), the
quadtree-based scheme has better performance in terms of
query cost. Second, it is focused on the update cost. Although
the quadtree-based scheme does not use the mobility profile
to minimize the update packets, the quadtree-based structure
limits the update propagation naturally.
The query success rate is also an important performance
metric. The query success rate is defined as the ratio of
the number of replies received by the user to the number
of queries issued by the user. Fig. 2(b) shows the results.
Because the tree-based scheme suffers from more severe
collision problem, the success rate becomes reduced when the
query rate becomes higher. Thus, the quadtree-based scheme
has better performance in terms of query success rate when
the traffic load is high. Fig. 2(c) shows the results of query
response time which is defined as the duration from the time
at which the user issues a query to the time at which the
user receives the corresponding reply. As mentioned above, in
the quadtree-based scheme, it is not necessary to forward the
query to the sensor that is detecting the queried object. Thus,
the quadtree-based scheme has better performance in terms of
the query response time.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The major contribution of this paper is the proposal of a
novel location management scheme called the quadtree-based
scheme. Compared with the traditional tree-based scheme, the
quadtree-based scheme does not need taking any statistics.
Besides, the proposed scheme benefits from low structure
maintenance cost. Simulation results also demonstrate the
efficiency of the quadtree-based scheme.

the i-th level-l quad. (b) An example of the basic operation of the quadtree-

So far, the quadtree-based structure and the update operation
have been briefly described. The remaining issue is the query
operation. A query can be issued from anywhere and the query
will be forwarded to the level-1 leader first. Because update
packets will be sent to the level-1 leader when objects cross
the level-1 boundary, the level-1 leader can easily know that it
should forward the query to which level-2 leader. For example,
in Fig. 1(b), the level-1 leader knew that it should forward the
query to Quad(2, 1) at t0 and t1 because the level-1 leader
only received one update packet after the object entered the
sensing field at t0 and t1. The level-1 leader will receive
another update packet when the object crosses the level-1
boundary from Quad(2, 1) to Quad(2, 2). Thus, at t2, the
level-1 leader can know that it should forward the query to the
level-2 leader of Quad(2, 2) rather than to the level-2 leader
of Quad(2, 1) so as to get more precise location information.
When a level-2 leader receives the query from the level-1
leader, there are two cases that should be discussed. In the first
case, the level-2 leader does not have any location information
of the queried object. For example, in Fig. 1(b), the leader of
Quad(2, 1) did not have any location information of the car
at t0, because the car did not cross the level-2 boundary of
Quad(2, 1) yet. Thus, the leader with lower level value should
embed the latest location information in the query so that the
next leader can know how to process the query. For example,
at t0, the leader of Quad(2, 1) knew that the car was located
in Quad(3, 1) by the latest location information of the object
embedded by the level-1 leader. In the second case, the level-2
leader has the location information of the queried object. For
example, when the object crosses the level-2 boundary from
Quad(3, 1) to Quad(3, 2), an update packet will be sent to the
leader of Quad(2, 1) so that the leader of Quad(2, 1) knows
that it should forward the query to the leader of Quad(3, 2)
so as to get more precise location information. Then, the same
rules can be applied to the level-3 leaders, and so forth. (Note
that a query will be forwarded to the next leader only when
the next leader is available.)

A. Update Operation
Now, the details of the update operation will be presented.
To begin with, Level(v) will be defined. If a sensor v is on
level-i boundary, then Level(v) = i. If a sensor v is not on
any boundary, then Level(v) = MAX LEV EL + 1, where
MAX LEV EL is the maximum level value in the network.
(Note that the value of MAX LEV EL can be known after
the boundary construction process.) Besides, it is assumed that
each leader, say x, will maintain an object list, which records
the latest information of the objects known by x. Each entry
of x’s object list can be represented as < o, loc, rec time >,
where o is the ID of the recorded object, loc is the latest
location of o known by x, and rec time is the time at which o
was located at loc. When a leader receives an update message,
it will update its object list accordingly.
When an object o moves from sensor a to sensor b, the
sensors will act as follows. (Note that an update message
can be represented as Update(o, loc, rec time), where loc is
the latest location of o known by the sensor that detects the
movement event, and rec time denotes the time at which the
sensor detects the event.)
• If Level(a) < Level(b), then sensor a will send an
update message Update(o, loc, rec time) to its leader
(By doing so, when a’s leader receives a query, it can
know that it should forward the query to which level-
