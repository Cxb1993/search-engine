Abstract 
In this paper, the equations of motion of a swinging roller-follower cam for rise-dwell-fall-dwell 
(RDFD) motion are derived by applying Hamilton’s principle and the assumed mode method. Four 
cam profiles for RDFD motions are used to describe the rise and the fall motions of the follower. 
The corresponding cam profile is determined using theory of envelopes. The follower rod is 
considere。d to be flexible and modeled as a Rayleigh beam including axial and transverse 
deflections. The roller rolls in the cam groove. The contact point between the cam and the roller is 
an unknown point though it is restrained in the cam groove. Two geometric constraints are 
formulated to restrict the roller motion and added to the Hamilton’s principle with Lagrange 
multipliers. The numerical integration method is applied to solve the established non-linear 
differential-algebraic equations to obtain the vibration responses of the cam system. The numerical 
results including the time history and the FFT spectra for four cam profiles are obtained and 
compared. The parameter effects including the rotation speed, the length and the radius of the 
follower rod, the roller mass, and the total rise are also investigated. 
 
Keywords: cam, roller-follower, rise-dwell-fall-dwell, swinging.

part, the roller, which is pinned to the follower 
stem. The follower rod is considered to be 
flexible and described by using Rayleigh beam 
theory. Since the roller moves in the groove, 
the roller maintains contact with the cam and 
rolls on the cam surface as the cam rotates. The 
rigid-body motions and the flexible vibrations 
are restrained by the contact constraints. 
The kinetic energy and strain energy of the 
rod, the kinetic energy of the roller, and the 
work done by the constraint forces are 
formulated first. The follower deflections are 
expanded using the assumed mode method. 
Then, the governing equations of the flexible 
follower rod are derived by employing 
Hamilton’s principle.  
2.1 The cam profile for RDFD case   
The schematic of a cam mechanism is 
shown in Fig. 1. The angular displacement 
function of the follower rod when the cam 
rotates an angle θ  is denoted as )(θφ . The 
rise-dwell-fall-dwell (RDFD) motion studied in 
this paper is described in Fig. 3. Four cam 
profiles are considered with different rise and 
fall motion. They include cycloidal 
displacement motion, modified sinusoidal 
acceleration motion, modified trapezoidal 
acceleration motion, and 3-4-5 polynomial 
motion. The angular displacement function 
)(θφ  for the rise segment is given with the 
following four functions: (Chen [1])

transverse vibration response for the four 
RDFD motions with =Ω 320 rad/s . To observe 
the vibration behavior of the follower rod 
conventiently, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 
spectra diagram for the four RDFD motions is 
established. The FFT spectra of the transverse 
and axial vibration response at the output node 
for cycloidal displacement motion with 
srad /320=Ω are plotted in Figs. 9 and 10, 
respectively. It is shown that the axial response 
amplitude is far smaller than the transverse 
response amplitude. For the transverse 
vibration response, the peaks concentrate at the 
low frequencies and odd times Ω . The highest 
peak occurs at triple Ω . A peak locates at 
about 41.5Ω  (13280 srad / ) which is close to 
the fundamental natural frequency.  
The peak amplitude of the transverse 
vibration spectra of the follower output node 
for the four RDFD motions with 
srad /320=Ω is listed in Table 1. It is shown 
that the peaks at Ω1 , Ω3 , and Ω5 using the 
modified sinusoidal acceleration motion are 
smaller than those using the other three motions. 
The peak at 41.5 Ω  using the  cycloidal 
displacement motion is smaller than that using 
the other three motions. 
The parameter effects including the rotation 
speed, the length and the radius of the follower 
rod, the roller mass, and the total rise are also 
investigated. From Tables 2-6, it is found that 
the peaks at Ω1 , Ω3 , and Ω5 using the 
modified sinusoidal acceleration motion are 
smaller than those using the other three motions 
for the considered parameters. The peak close 
to the fundamental natural frequency using the  
cycloidal displacement motion is smaller than 
that using the other three motions. These results 
are similar to those in Table 1. In addition, the 
results in Table 2-6 are compared with Table 1 
to show that high rotation speed, longer and 
thinner follower rod, and larger total rise may 
induce larger vibration responses. However, the 
influence of roller mass on the system vibration 
is insignificant. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The equations of motion for the vibration of 
a swinging roller-follower cam for RDFD case 
are derived by using Hamilton’s principle and 
the assumed mode method. The flexibility of 
the follower rod is considered and modeled as a 
Rayleigh beam. The roller motion is restrained 
in the cam groove under the follower 
deflections. Thus, two geometric constraints are 
formulated to be added to the Hamilton’s 
principle with Lagrange multipliers. The 
vibration response for the four RDFD motions 
including cycloidal displacement motion, 
modified sinusoidal acceleration motion, 
modified trapezoidal acceleration motion, and 
3-4-5 polynomial motion are investigated. The 
numerical results for the studied cases show 
that the axial vibration response is far smaller 
than the transverse vibration response. The FFT 
spectra show that the peaks at lower 
frequencies using the modified sinusoidal 
acceleration motion are smallest and the peak at 
higher frequency using the cyclodial 
displacement motion is smallest. The parameter 
study shows that high rotation speed, longer 
and thinner follower rod, and larger total rise 
may induce larger vibration responses. The 
influence of roller mass on the system vibration 
is insignificant.

factor into consideration. Fabien, Brian [10] presented a new 
approach to designing dwell-rise-dwell profiles for cam 
follower systems. The cam profiles are designed such that 
perturbations in the system parameters have a reduced 
influence on the dynamic response. This is accomplished by 
minimizing the parameter sensitivity of output mass motion. 
Followers driven by high-speed, dwell-type, rotating disk cams 
can exhibit undesirable residual vibrations during dwell. 
Dresner and Barkan [11] provided the following: a brief review 
of the literature on the dynamic analysis of flexible cam-
follower systems; a recommended method for the analysis of 
such systems; and an extension of this analysis method to 
multi-input systems. Coulomb dampers were shown to be 
important in modeling the behavior of flexible dynamic cam-
follower systems because they remove significant vibration 
energy, particularly when approaching the critical seating event. 
Felszeghy [12] studied a cam with a translating roller follower. 
He idealized the follower structure as a single degree-of-
freedom, spring-mass-dashpot, linear system. These residual 
vibrations were obtained with closed-form solutions to the 
steady-state vibrations obtained with a circular convolution 
integral. The steady-state vibrations, which can extend over the 
entire cam cycle, were periodic and continuous. Demeulenaere 
etc. [13] introduced a cam-based centrifugal pendulum (CBCP) 
and a design procedure for it which results in quasi-perfect 
balancing of inertial torques for any drive speed. For given 
design parameters (such as the link lengths and link inertial 
parameters), the cam design is governed by a nonlinear, 
second-order, explicit differential equation. The design 
parameters themselves are determined by means of an 
optimization problem, the goal of which is to minimize the 
(constant) equivalent inertia of the combined system, consisting 
of the original mechanism to be balanced and the CBCP. Wang 
and Jiang [14] studied the cam mechanism which was 
developed on the equivalent concept and the method of lumped 
masses in dynamic modeling of cam mechanisms. The method 
of using double lumped equivalent masses located in two ends 
of a component to substitute the mass of it in modeling was put 
out and proved to be true. The proposed improved the accuracy 
of the dynamic model of cam mechanisms. 
In this paper, a disk cam with an oscillating roller follower 
is studied. The follower rod is taken to be flexible. The rod is 
pinned with a roller which is restrained in a rigid rotating cam 
groove. Since the follower is flexible, the contact point of the 
roller and the cam is an unknown though it locates at the cam 
profile. On the contrary, the contact point is assumed to be a 
known point related to the cam profile in the conventional 
study. Two geometric constraints are established and added to 
the Hamilton’s principle with Lagrange multipliers. The 
transverse and axial deflections are expanded with the assumed 
mode method. The vibration response of the follower is 
obtained from the derived differential-algebraic equation by 
applying the Runge-Kutta integration method. Some parameter 
effects are also investigated. The contact constraint problems 
are also met in translating-follower cam and transmission 
mechanisms which are used in engine.

2  DERIVATION OF GOVERNING EQUATIONS 
A disk cam with a swinging roller follower is shown in Fig. 
1 and Fig. 2. The cam is assumed to be rigid. The roller 
follower consists of a follower rod that has a separate part, the 
roller, which is pinned to the follower stem. The follower rod is 
considered to be flexible and described by using Rayleigh beam 
theory. Since the roller moves in the groove, the roller 
maintains contact with the cam and rolls on the cam surface as 
the cam rotates. The rigid-body motions and the flexible 
vibrations are restrained by the contact constraints. 
The kinetic energy and strain energy of the rod, the kinetic 
energy of the roller, the gravity potential energy, and the work 
done by the constraint forces are formulated first. The follower 
deflections are expanded using the assumed mode method. 
Then, the governing equations of the flexible follower rod are 
derived by employing Hamilton’s principle.  
2.1 The Cam Profile for RDFD Case 
The schematic of a cam mechanism is shown in Fig. 1. The 
angular displacement function of the follower rod when the 
cam rotates an angle θ  is denoted as )(θφ . The rise-dwell-
fall-dwell (RDFD) motion studied in this paper is described in 
Fig. 3. The cam profile is considered with rise and fall motions 
of cycloidal displacement (sinusoidal acceleration). The angular

2.3 Assumed Mode Method  
The follower rod is hinged at the pivot point. For satisfying 
the boundary condition at the hinged support, one can expand

where rodT  and rollerT  are the kinetic energy of the follower 
rod and the roller, respectively. rodU is the strain energy of the 
follower rod. rodV , and rollerV  are the gravity potential 
energy of the follower rod and the roller, respectively. 11Φλ  
and 22Φλ  are the works done by the constraint forces.  
Substituting Eqs. (20) and (21) into Eq. (22), one can 
derive the system equation of motion. The equation is 
expressed as

where M , N , and λ  are mass matrix, dynamic vector, and 
Lagrange multiplier vector, respectively. Coriolis effect and the 
associated damping effect are found in the dynamic vector. F  
is the forcing vector due to gravity force. It is noted that the 
mass matrix is time-dependent. Q  is the generalized 
coordinates vector and expressed as

interval for high rotation speed of cam are of significance to a 
certain extent. 
 The follower length effect on the vibration is studied. Two 
lengths of the follower rod, 98 and 118 mm  are used. The 
vibration results are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. The maximum 
response amplitudes in the axial and transverse directions for 
=l 118 mm  are all higher than those for =l 98 mm . This 
may be explained that longer follower rod makes lower 
stiffness of the rod to bring about larger response. It is also 
found that the follower length influences the phase of the axial 
and transverse deflections. The follower cross-sectional radius 
effect is also studied. The vibration responses with two cross-
sectional radii of the follower rod, 5 and 10 mm , are 
compared in Figs. 10 and 11. It is seen that the vibration 
responses are larger for the smaller cross-sectional radius of the 
follower rod. This may also be explained that smaller cross-
sectional radius of follower rod makes lower stiffness of the 
rod. Two different total rises are also studied. They are 
18
πφ =T  and rad12π . It is seen from Figs. 12 and 13 that 
larger total rise induces larger vibration response.  
5  CONCLUSIONS 
The equations of motion for the vibration of a swinging 
roller-follower cam for RDFD case are derived by using 
Hamilton’s principle and the assumed mode method. The 
flexibility of the follower rod is considered and modeled as a 
Rayleigh beam. The roller motion is restrained in the cam 
groove under the follower deflections. Thus, two geometric 
constraints are formulated to be added to the Hamilton’s 
principle with Lagrange multipliers. The numerical results for 
the studied cases show that the axial and transverse vibration 
responses of the follower are large for high rotation speed of 
cam. Even during the dwell interval, the follower vibrates to 
some extent especially for high rotation speed of cam. The 
follower rod with larger length or smaller cross-sectional radius 
induces larger response amplitude of the follower. The larger 
total rise also brings about larger response amplitude.
