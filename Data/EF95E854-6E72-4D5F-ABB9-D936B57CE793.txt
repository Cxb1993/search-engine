hardness distributions at different 
penetration depths are directly related to the 
nitrogen concentration distributions. 
In the present study, three steel 
materials, P20 (AISI P20 DEM NO.3), 
ASSAB 718 (AISI H13) and AISI 420, were 
selected as the mold substrate materials 
used in the plastic injection forming. The 
plasma immersion ion implantation (PⅢ) 
technique was applied to enhance the 
specimen’s mechanical properties, including 
hardness, fatigue life, fracture toughness, 
and scratch wear resistance. A nanotester 
was applied to obtain the hardnesses and 
Young’s moduli varying at different 
penetration depths of a specimen. The 
effects of the influential factors including 
the total penetration depth and the peak 
position on mean hardness are discussed. 
 Using XRD, the intensities of these 
three phases, ( Fe CrNα − + ), 4Fe N , and 
( , 2 ~ 3xFe N xε − = ), generated at the 
nitrided layer of a specimen prepared by 
varying either the implantation temperature 
or the volume flow rate ratio of nitrogen to 
hydrogen in the gas mixture (N2:H2) have 
been investigated. 
The interaction between fracture 
toughness and fatigue life is also 
investigated. The wear resistance and 
behavior of the nitrided layer in a specimen 
were evaluated by the nano scratch depths 
obtained either during the scratching 
process or after finishing the elastic 
recovery of wear track. The magnitudes of 
mean hardness, fracture toughness, and 
fatigue life are shown in order to find their 
relationship with the intensities of these 
three phases. 
 
2. Experimental Details 
 The specimens before the implantation 
of nitrogen ions ( N + and 2N
+ ) were made of 
three steels: P20, 718 and 420. The 
chemical compositions of these three 
materials are shown in Table1. The 
hardnesses of these three specimens (P20, 
718, 420) before nitriding are 3.83GPa, 
4.93GPa and 3.23GPa, respectively. The 
specimens were prepared to be a circular 
disk with a radius of 20mm and a thickness 
of 1.5 mm. The “pure” specimens are here 
defined as the specimens before applying 
the ion implantations. 
 The implantation process was carried 
out on a plasma immersion ion implantation 
(PⅢ) device. The plasma was generated by 
an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) 
microwave source at a frequency of 
2.54GHz. The microwave generator was 
driven by a DC power with 328 W (average). 
A pulse bias voltage of 12kV was applied in 
this system such that the pulse frequency 
was varied in a range of 150 Hz to 600 Hz 
and the pulse width was 20μs. Before the 
implantation process, four edges of every 
specimen were polished by 320-code 
abrasive paper into a round shape in order to 
avoid a point discharge during the 
implantation process. 
 Table 2 shows the implantation 
conditions, including the implantation 
voltage and the implantation time. In this 
P  system,Ⅲ  the implantation temperature 
was controlled by modulating the voltage 
and the frequency of ion bombarding. 
A glow discharge spectrometer (GDS) 
was applied to obtain the concentration 
distributions of nitrogen and the total 
penetration depth.

specimens.  
The relationship between fatigue life 
and the fracture toughness of a specimen 
was investigated in the present study. The 
results shown in Fig.6 indicate that both 
fatigue life and fracture toughness are 
elevated by raising the implantation 
temperature. An increase in the implantation 
temperature can elevate the fracture 
toughness of a specimen, thus resulting in 
an increase of the fatigue life. 
A X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was 
applied to detect the new phases formed in 
these eighteen kinds of specimens and 
shown in Fig.7(a) to Fig.7(c). The initial 
structure of an untreated specimen can be 
identified as an fcc Fe-rich α  phase only. 
After ion implantation, a family of peaks are 
shifted to smaller 2 θ  angles which 
correspond to an fcc crystalline phase with a 
larger lattice parameter, usually called 
nitrogen-rich expanded austenite phase, in 
general, contained ( )Fe CrNα − + , 
( , 2 ~ 3)xFe N xε − = , and 4Fe N . They 
varied with several factors including the 
substrate material, the implantation 
temperature, and the N2:H2 ratio in the gas 
mixture.  
The following behavior can be found 
from the comparisons of the X-ray 
diffraction patterns shown in Fig.7 and the 
mechanical properties shown in Fig.2 and  
Fig.5 : (a) The change in the implantation 
temperature to attenuate or even restrain the 
formation of the (α-Fe + CrN) phase in the 
nitrided layer can enhance the fatigue life 
and fracture toughness of the specimen; (b) 
the enhancement of specimen’s hardness is, 
however, the combined effect of these three 
main phases, rather than a single phase 
effect in a nitrided layer. 
Fig.8 is presented as an example to 
show the topographies of the wear tracks 
generated in the forward and backward 
movements of ten cycles. Each of these 
topographies was obtained at a sufficiently 
long time after finishing the scratch process 
of each cycle. In this figure, the number i 
(i=1, 2, 3, …, 10) marked near each curve 
indicates the topography generated at the 
(i)th cycle, irrespective of the forward or 
backward movement. 
 
Conclusions 
The following conclusions can be made 
from the study of the effects of implantation 
temperature and the N2:H2 ratio on nitrogen 
concentration distribution, mechanical 
properties, and tribological behavior of 
plasma-nitrided P20, 718 and 420 steels: 
1. The total penetration depth of nitrogen 
in a specimen is increased by elevating 
the implantation temperature, 
irrespective of the substrate material. A 
clear and definite relationship can not be 
found between the implantation 
temperature and the peak position of 
nitrogen concentration. The effect of the 
N2:H2 ratio on either the total 
penetration depth or the peak position of 
nitrogen can not be defined clearly too. 
2. For the specimens with the same 
substrate material, the mean hardness of 
the nitrided layer is either almost 
invariant or lowered by an increase in 
the total penetration depth of nitrogen. 
The mean hardness is lowered by 
increasing the distance of the peak 
position of nitrogen concentration from
