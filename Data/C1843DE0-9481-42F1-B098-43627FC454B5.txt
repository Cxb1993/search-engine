摘要 
 
本研究設計並開發一個高效率平板式濕式靜電集塵器用以控制細微粒及奈米微粒
污染物。本集塵器之寬為 75 mm，有效微粒沈降長度及氣膠通道間隙分別為 48 mm 及
9.0 mm。本濕式靜電集塵器之收集板表面經噴砂處理後塗敷 TiO2 奈米微粒，以提高表
面親水性，用以取代親水性薄膜的設計；電暈放電電極由三條黃金電極線(直徑為 100μm)
所構成；一個氣體脈衝閥用以連續且規律的清潔附著在電極線表面之粉塵，使集塵器維
持最佳的集塵效率。本濕式靜電集塵器之設計目的在於解決以下傳統乾式靜電集塵器在
使用上之問題：粉塵沈降於收集板表面及放電電極上使集塵效率下降、背電暈及粉塵再
揚起。最後，我們在起始乾淨條件下及經過高濃度粉塵負荷後進行濕式靜電集塵器集塵
效率測試，並與乾式靜電集塵器之測試結果做比較。 
實驗結果顯示當施加電壓為 4.3 kV、氣膠流量為 5 L/min（微粒停留時間為 0.39 s）
時，本濕式靜電集塵器在起始乾淨狀況下對 16.8-615 nm 電移動度粒徑之奈米微粒去除
效率為 96.9-99.7 %。在相同操作條件下經過 1.2±0.06 g/plate 之 TiO2 高粉塵濃度負荷後，
濕式集塵器對於 16.8-615 nm 之玉米油微粒之去除效率仍可維持在 94.7-99.0 %。 
本研究首先建立了一個拉式數值模式來推估靜電集塵器對粒徑分佈為 0.1≦dp≦10 
μm 之微粒的集塵效率。微粒的充電及運動方程式係利用四階 Runge-Kutta 法來求解，以
求得微粒的帶電量及微粒移動軌跡。比對結果發現，模擬出的收集效率與 Huang and 
Chen (2002)及 Chang and Bai (1999)的實驗值相符，誤差範圍分別為 0.68-14.57 %及
1.49-12.46 %。但此模式僅適用於推估靜電集塵器對 dp≧100 nm 之微粒的集塵效率，無
法有效計算出部分充電效應對奈米微粒收集效率的影響。 
為了準確預估單極電極線-平板靜電集塵器對奈米微粒(dp≦100 nm)的收集效率，本
研究建立了一個 2 維數值歐拉模式來模擬電場、離子濃度分佈，及微粒充電量。集塵器
內部的流場係利用 SIMPLER 方法來計算之，而電場強度及離子濃度分佈則利用 Poisson
方程式及對流擴散方程式來求解。帶電微粒的濃度分佈及微粒去除效率分別利用對流擴
散方程式及 Fuch 充電理論進行計算。 
針對 6-100 nm 之奈米微粒，本研究模擬之微粒收集效率與 Huang and Chen (2002)
的實驗數據比對結果發現，模擬值與實驗值吻合(氣膠流量: 100 L/min, 施加電壓: 
-15.5~-21.5 kV)。進一步比對模擬的收集效率值與濕式靜電集塵器(Lin et al. 2010)的收集
效率實驗值結果發現，模擬值與集塵器對單徑分佈、粒徑為 10 及 50 nm 的食鹽微粒及
多徑分佈、粒徑分佈範圍為 5.23-107.5 nm 之銀微粒的去除效率實驗值相符(氣膠流量: 5 
L/min, 施加電壓: +3.6~+4.3 kV)。 
本單極平板濕式靜電集塵器在高濃度粉塵負荷下可有效的去除細微粒及奈米微
粒。預期本濕式靜電集塵器可作為高效率微粒去除設備及奈米微粒採樣器。本研究建立
的數值模式可用於設計大型的單極平板濕式靜電集塵器，以解決傳統乾式靜電集塵器在
實際操作上所面臨的問題。

particle collection efficiencies were further shown to agree with the experimental data 
obtained in the study for a wire-in-plate wet ESP (Lin et al. 2010) (aerosol flow rate: 5 L/min, 
applied voltage: +3.6~+4.3 kV) using monodisperse NaCl particles of 10 and 50 nm in 
diameter, and polydisperse Ag particles of 5.23-107.5 nm in diameter. 
The present single-stage wire-in-plate wet ESP was found to remove fine and nanosized 
particle effectively under heavy loading conditions. It is expected that the present wet ESP 
could be used as efficient particle removal equipment or a nanoparticle sampler. The present 
model could facilitate the design and scale-up of the single-stage wire-in-plate wet ESP to 
control fine and nanosized particles without the typical problems associated with dry ESPs.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Motivation 
In recent year, the applications of nanomaterials are increasing rapidly in many industries 
including textile, optics, electronics, medical devices, biosensors, and environmental remediation 
(Smith et al. 2007). During manufacturing and shipping of nanomaterials, nanoparticles could be 
released into environment posing adverse effects on aquatic species and human health (Griffitt et al. 
2007; Oberdörster et al. 2005). Thus, efficient control of nanoparticle emissions effectively has 
become an important research topic.  
Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), including dry and wet types, have been widely used to remove 
particles emitted from various industrial processes. ESPs are capable of handing large flow rates of 
exhaust gas with low electrical power consumption because of it’ low pressure drop through the 
collection chamber (USEPA 1999). When particles are introduced into a single-stage ESP, they are 
charged by diffusion and field charging mechanisms and are collected by electrostatic forces on the 
collection electrodes (Hinds 1999). In a well-designed dry ESP, the collection efficiency for micron 
and submicron particles can reach up to 95% as shown in several experimental (Huang and Chen 2002; 
Marek et al. 2005) and numerical studies (Oglesby and Nichols 1978; Yoo et al. 1997; Goo and Lee 
1997). However, aerosol penetration was found to increase with increasing operation time due to the 
deposition of particles on both the discharge wires and collection electrodes. Huang and Chen (2003) 
constructed a laboratory-scale, single-stage, wire-plate dry ESP to investigate the loading effect of 
particles on the collection efficiency. Their results showed that the aerosol penetration for fine cement 
particles of 0-600 nm in diameter increased after 120 min of particle loading due to the reduction of 
the ion current. The maximum penetration increase of 4 % (from 3.5 to 7.5 %) occurred at 300 nm. In 
addition to the decrease in collection efficiency from the accumulated dust cake, back corona also 
reduced the efficiency by decreasing the particle charging ratio and migration velocity (Chang and Bai 
1999). Furthermore, dry ESPs can not be used to control sticky or oily particles, which are difficult to 
remove from the collection electrodes by rapping (Altman et al. 2001).  
The objective of this study was to develop a wire-in-plate single-stage wet ESP to enhance the 
collection efficiency of fine and nanosized particles. The design of the present wet ESP was aimed at 
solving the problems of the traditional dry ESPs: reduction of the collection efficiency due to particle 
deposition on the discharge electrodes and collection electrodes, back corona, and particle 
re-entrainment. 
1.2 Objective 
Wet ESPs have been developed to solve the problems associated with the traditional dry ESPs. 
Previous works on particle collection efficiency of wet ESPs include the experimental studies of 
Lungren et al. (1995), Kim et al. (2000), Pasic et al. (2001), Bayless et al. (2004) and Saiyasitpanich et 
al. (2006; 2007). However, most of the researchers focused on investigation of collection efficiency 
 3 
data published in the previous researches (Chang and Bai 1999; Huang and Chen 2002) and obtained 
for the present wet ESP. Finally, the numerical results for the parametric study of a pilot scale wet ESP 
are presented. In chapter 5, conclusions of this thesis are drawn and future work is recommended. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1 Experimental studies on wet ESPs for particle control 
    Wet ESPs have been developed to control a wider variety of particulate pollutants and exhaust 
gas conditions compared to dry ESPs, especially for particles that are sticky, corrosive, or have high 
resistivity (Altman et al. 2001a; Altman et al. 2001b). The periodic or continuous scrubbing water 
flow, used to wash the collection electrode surfaces, was found to prevent particle re-entrainment 
caused by rapping, which occurs in dry ESPs (USEPA 2003). The traditional methods to distribute 
water uniformly on the collection plate surfaces include vapor condensation or spraying (Altman et al., 
2001b; Bayless et al., 2004). In the vapor condensation method, moisture in the gas condenses to form 
water film on the collection plate surfaces due to the temperature differential between the cold surface 
and the hot gas. In the spraying method, water droplet is emitted by nozzles at the top or bottom of 
ESPs to wash the collection plates. However, aqueous mist used in these two methods will result in 
sparkover to reduce electric field strength and particle collection efficiency (Bayless et al. 2004). 
Lungren et al. (1995) invented a wire-in-tube wet ESP in which the charging electrode consisted 
of a tapered section, a rod and four discs to enhance particles charging efficiency. Scrubbing water 
was first introduced onto a diamond-shaped plate, which was used to equalize the water flow, and then 
flowed into the inner surface of the collection electrode to remove the collected particles. They found 
that the opacity of the flue gas was reduced from 35 to 0 % in the pilot unit when the applied voltage 
was increased from 30 to 75 kV. However, the collection efficiency for different particle diameters 
and particle loadings was not discussed. Similar types of wire-in-tube wet ESPs were used to control 
the emissions of incinerator flue gas (Kim et al. 2000) and diesel particulate matter (Saiyasitpanich et 
al. 2006; Saiyasitpanich et al. 2007). The collection efficiency of particle mass of the wet ESP for 
10-1000 nm diesel particles was measured to be from 92 to 69 % when the gas velocity was from 1.38 
to and 5.61 m/s (or the corresponding residence time from 0.4 to 0.1 sec) (Saiyasitpanich et al. 2007), 
respectively. 
However, the collection efficiency under heavy particle loading conditions for long time periods 
was not studied. Moreover, the previous study used a high flow rate of scrubbing water (4.44-6.22 
L/min/m
2
 of collection area), which resulted in a thick water film, thus decreasing the electric field 
strength due to water’s resistivity.  
To improve the uniformity of the liquid film over the collection electrodes without having to 
supply the scrubbing water at high flow rate, Pasic et al. (2001) invented a membrane electrostatic 
precipitator which used hydrophilic membranes made of corrosion resistant woven fibers as the 
collection electrodes. The tensile apparatuses were needed to stretch the membranes during operation 
 5 
distribution of the electric field. (3) The effects of particle reentrainment, uneven gas flow distribution, 
and back corona on collection efficiency are not taken into consideration.  
    Many researchers developed numerical models based on charging model for continuum regime 
(Kn=2λi/dp1, λi : mean free path of ions, dp: particle diameter) to predict collection efficiency of the 
wire-in-plate dry ESPs for particles ranging from 0.3-10 μm in diameter. Good agreement between 
experimental data and numerical results was obtained (Goo and Lee 1997; Park and Kim 2000, 2003; 
Park and Chun 2002; Talaie 2001, 2005). For example, a numerical model based on Lagrangian 
method with turbulent electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow field was developed to predict particle 
collection efficiency and further validated with experimental data of Kihm (1987) (Goo and Lee 1997). 
The particle charging rate was calculated by using combined charging model of Fuchs model (1947) 
for diffusion charging and Pauthenier and Moreau-Hanot’s model (1932) for field charging (The 
combined charging model shown in section 3.2.4 was also used in the present study to predict the 
charge for particles with dp≧100 nm). The calculated results were found to be lower than the 
experimental data at the applied voltage of 6.5~13 kV for 4 μm particles. The deviation between the 
calculated values and the experimental data is probably due to the difficulty in estimating exact 
charging properties of particles, the inlet conditions of flow and particles, and the experimental error.  
The effects of the EHD flow and turbulent diffusion on the collection efficiency of particles in a 
wire-cavity plate dry ESP was further studied by using a numerical model based on Eulerian method 
(Park and Kim, 2000; 2003). Particle charges were obtained by solving White’s equation (1967), 
which is given by

where κd is the dielectric constant of particles, ε0 is the permittivity of free air (F/m). Good agreement 
between experimental and computational data of collection efficiency was obtained for 4.5 μm Al2O3 
particles when the applied voltage and air velocity were 7.5~15 kV and 0.5~1 m/s, respectively.  
    Park and Chun (2002) developed a numerical model to investigate the effect of turbulent 
dispersion on particle collection efficiency without considering the nonuniform distribution of electric 
field and ion concentration in a wire-in-plate dry ESP. The eddy diffusivity of a particle is given as 
follows: 
     
h
y
D peddy  , 0≦y≦h (2.5) 
 
peddyD  , h≦y≦sy (2.6) 
 
 7 
The author also noted that a complete model should necessarily include a realistic particle charging 
model, an electrostatic field strength distribution, and a more realistic flow field. 
    Except for the effect of EHD and the turbulent dispersion coefficient, the effect of polydisperse 
particle loading on the particle collection efficiency was also taken into consideration in Talaie et al. 
(2001), who developed a mathematical model based on Eulerian method to predict the collection 
efficiency of a double-stage wire-in-plate dry ESP. The particle charging rate was calculated by using 
White’s equation (1967). The numerical values were in good agreement with the experimental data of 
Leonard (1982) for 3.5 μm oleic acid drops.  
As discussed above, the numerical models for predicting collection efficiency for particles in the 
size range of 0.3-10 μm in wire-in-plate ESPs have been well-developed. For particles with 
100≦dp≦200 nm, the numerical model of Yoo et al. (1997) based on Fuchs diffusion charging 
model (1947) and the field charging model of Pauthenier and Moreau-Hanot (1932) was able to 
predict the particle collection efficiency accurately. However, the combined charging model used by 
Yoo et al. (1997) was found to over-predict particle charge for particles with dp≦100 nm in Lawless 
(1996), who concluded that 100 nm was the limit of applicability of the combined charging model.   
In the transition regime (Kn≈1), Fuchs model (1963), which was used by Zhuang et al. (2000) and 
Li and Christofides (2006) to predict particle charge in ESPs, was shown to be accurate for particles 
with dp>30 nm (Adachi et al. 1985; Pui et al. 1988). However, the numerical model could not predict 
the experimental collection efficiency accurately for 30<dp<400 nm because the flow field and the 
non-uniform ion concentration distribution were not calculated in Zhuang et al. (2000). In the work of 
Li and Christofides (2006), non-uniform electric field and ion concentration were not considered either 
and simulated particle collection efficiencies were not compared with experimental data. Therefore, 
the applicability of the previous models (Yoo et al. 1997; Zhaung et al. 2000; Li and Christofides 2006) 
for 30≦dp≦100 nm requires further investigations. 
For particles with dp<30 nm, experimental data (Huang and Chen 2002) and numerical results 
(Yoo et al. 1997; Zhaung et al. 2000; Li and Christofides 2006) showed that a fraction of particles was 
uncharged and penetrated through ESPs, resulting in decreasing collection efficiency as dp was 
decreased from 30 nm to 5 nm.  This is called the partial charging effect. Marlow and Brock’s model 
(1975) was shown to provide accurate prediction of particle charge for dp<30 nm (Pui et al. 1975). 
However, Marlow and Brock’s model has not been applied to examine the partial charging effect on 
the collection efficiency of the ESP. The combined charging model used in Yoo et al. (1997) 
over-predicted particle charge in the transition regime, as compared to the experimental data of Fjeld 
and MacFarland (1986), leading to an overestimation of collection efficiency for particles below 30 
nm. The Fuchs model (1963) used in Zhuang et al. (2000) and Li and Christofides (2006) also 
over-predicted particle charge for dp<30 nm, which also led to an overestimation of the collection 
efficiency.  
In the traditional dry ESPs, particle collection efficiency, especially for nanoparticle, decreases 
with increasing operation time due to particle deposition on discharge electrodes and collection 
electrodes (Huang and Chen 2003), back corona (Chang and Bai 1999), and particle re-entrainment 
 9 
thickness) was attached to the inner surface. A copper plate was used as collection electrode because 
of its high conductivity and ease with sandblasting. In order to make scrubbing water film flow 
uniformly on the collection electrodes (G) at low flow rates, a frosted glass plate (FG, 70 mm in length, 
75 mm in width and 3.0 mm in thickness) coated with TiO2 nanopowder (Degussa AEROXITE TiO2 
P25, Anatase, 20 nm) is attached to the inner surface (M) above the copper plate. Between the 
collection electrodes, a center piece (C) is sandwiched to form a 9 mm gap between the electrodes. On 
the center piece, three gold discharge wires (GW) (99% purity, 100 μm in diameter, Surepure 
Chemetals Inc.) spaced at 16 mm in the flow direction are fixed. These gold wires were used as 
discharge wires due to their long lifetime of more than 6 months (Asbach 2004). Two overflowing 
(OR) and collection reservoirs (CR) for continuous scrubbing water flow are installed at the top and 
bottom of the ESP, respectively. A pulse jet valve (Bag Filter Enterprise Co. Ltd., Taiwan) was used to 
generate pulse jet passing through 3 rows of small holes (diameter: 1.0 mm, 24 holes on each row) on 
the collection plates. The discharge wires were cleaned every 5 minutes with an instantaneous pressure 
of 2.95 atm (3.05 kg/cm
2
) and the instantaneous air flow rate passing through all 24 holes per wire was 
calculated to be 11 L/s. Pulse duration was about 0.5 sec. During pulse jet cleaning, the scrubbing 
water flow was stopped for two minutes to prevent sparking over due to the water mist generated by 
the pulse jet.

3.1.2 Particle collection efficiency experiment and loading test 
The particle collection efficiency experiments under initially clean conditions were conducted at 
aerosol flow rates of 5 and 10 L/min (corresponding to residence times of 0.39 and 0.19 seconds, 
respectively, over the total precipitation length of 48 mm, which is assumed to be three times the wire 
spacing) with applied voltages ranging from 3.8 to 4.3 kV. The experiment under each operation 
condition was tested for 6 to 8 hours. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 3.4. Polydisperse 
liquid corn oil particles (density of 0.9 g/cm

) and silver particles (density of 10.49 g/cm

) were 
generated by the evaporation-condensation technique (Scheibel et al. 1982) at an oven temperature of

C, respectively. Two rotameters were used to control carrier gas and cooling air flow 
rates to obtain the desired particle diameter and concentration. Before being introduced into the 
present wet ESP, all charged particles were removed using a wire-in-tube ESP allowing only 
zero-charged particles to enter the wet ESP. To generate an electric field and corona ions, high 
positive voltage was supplied to the corona wires using a high voltage D.C. power supplier (Model 
SL150, Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corporation, NY, USA). The voltage and corresponding 
corona current were read directly from the power supplier. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, 
model 3081, TSI Inc.) coupled with a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3022, TSI Inc.) was 
used to measure the size distribution of the polydisperse particles. The characteristics and number size 
distribution of the test aerosols are shown in Table 3.1, respectively. The particle collection efficiency 
of the wet ESP, ηtotal(dp), was calculated by the following equation:

where Cin(dp) is the particle inlet concentration (cm

The particle collection efficiency experiment for monodisperse NaCl particle (particle 
density=2200 kg/m
3
) was also conducted in this study. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 3.5. 
Test particles were generated by the evaporation-condensation technique in an oven temperature at 
temperature of 650 to 700 ℃. The generated particles were then passed through a nano-DMA 
(differential mobility analyzer, TSI Model 3085) to obtain monodisperse particles with dp of 10 and 50 
nm. The experiment was conducted at an aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min and at an applied voltage of 
+3.6~+4.3 kV. A condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3022, TSI Inc.) was used to measure 
particle number concentration. For 10 and 50 nm particles, the inlet concentration of the ESP was 
measured to be 1.2×10

To study particle loading effect on the collection efficiency and possible particle reentrainment 
after particle loading, Degussa P25 TiO2 nanopowder (resistivity of 0.75×10

was dispersed by a Jet-O-Mizer (Model 000, Fluid Energy Processing and Equipment Co., Hatfield,

3.2 Numerical method 
3.2.1 Flow field 
The calculation domains for the dry ESP of Huang and Chen (2002) and the wet ESP (Lin et al. 
2010) are shown as the hatched areas in Figures 3.6 (a) and (b), respectively. The dimensions of the 
present wet ESP were described in the previous experimental method section. The wire-in-plate dry 
ESP in Huang and Chen (2002) was 300 mm in length, 120 mm in width, and 76 mm in height. Three 
discharge wires had the diameter of 0.3 mm. The wire to wire spacing and wire to plate spacing was 
42 and 60 mm, respectively.  
A total of 19,368 (269 in x-direction, 72 in y-direction) non-uniform rectangular girds were used 
in each of the calculation domains. The average grid size was about 62.5 and 372 μm in x and y 
direction. The smallest size of 2.35 and 1.94 μm was assigned near the wall of the collection plate of 
the ESP in Huang and Chen (2002) and the present wet ESP, respectively. It was found that increasing 
the number of girds from 269×72 to 269×92 only resulted in a slight decreasing of particle diffusion 
loss from 38.5 to 37.6 % for 10 nm particles in the present wet ESP. Thus, a fixed number of grid of 
269×72 was used in the present simulation. The total number of iterations to reach convergence was 
about 10000 for solving the flow field. 
The laminar flow field model was used in both cases because the flow Reynolds numbers based 
on the hydrodynamic diameter were 130.5 and 1124.4 in the wet ESP (Lin et al. 2010) and the dry 
ESP (Huang and Chen 2002), respectively, which were all smaller than 2000 (Hinds, 1999). The 
governing equations for the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations are

3.2.4 Turbulent flow field in a pilot scale wet ESP 
In order to examine the effect of variation of design parameters for ESPs on particle collection 
efficiency, a pilot scale wet ESP was sumulated which had 750-1100 mm in length, 150-300 mm in 
width, and 6 m in height. There are 3-6 discharge wires each of which had the diameter of 1.3-2.5 mm. 
The wire to wire spacing and wire to plate spacing was 50-75 and 75-150 mm, respectively. A total of 
21,744 (302 in x-direction, 72 in y-direction) non-uniform rectangular girds were used in this 
calculation domain.  
The turbulent flow field model was used in this case. The time-averaged equations for mass,

wet ESPs, at various supplied voltages. It is seen that at the same voltage, the corona current was 
decreased after supplying the scrubbing water on the collection plate surfaces, due to the resistivity of 
the water film. Hence, the wet ESP collection efficiency is expected to be lower than the dry ESP 
operating at the same voltage. Therefore, for the initially clean condition the operation voltage has to 
be increased for the present wet ESP to have the same collection efficiency as the dry ESP. As will be 
shown later, the advantage of using scrubbing water flow and purge air flow becomes obvious when 
the collection surfaces are loaded heavily with TiO2 nanopowder. 
 
4.1.2 Particle collection efficiency of the wet ESP at different aerosol flow rates and applied voltages 
Figure 4.2 shows the collection efficiency of the wet ESP as a function of corn oil diameter when 
the aerosol flow rate is 5 and 10 L/min and the applied voltage is 4.3 kV under the initially clean 
condition. The residence time of the aerosol in the present wet ESP was calculated to be 0.39 and 0.19 
s for aerosol flow rates of 5 and 10 L/min, respectively. As seen in Figure 4.2, decreasing the flow rate 
from 10 to 5 L/min (or increasing the residence time from 0.19 to 0.39 sec) had a substantial effect on 
the collection efficiency as the Deutsch-Anderson equation dictates. At the flow rate of 5 L/min, the 
collection efficiency was 96.9-99.7 % for particles from 16.8 to 615 nm in electrical mobility diameter. 
The minimum collection of 96.9 % corresponds to the particle diameter of 126.3 nm. As the flow rate 
is increased to 10 L/min, the minimum collection efficiency is reduced to 84.1 % at the corresponding 
diameter of 70 nm.  
 According to particle charging theory, particle charge decreases with decreasing particle diameter, 
while the mechanical mobility increases rapidly with decreasing particle diameter (Hinds 1999). 
Therefore, the collection efficiency of ESPs for particles in the size range of 0.1 to 1 μm has a U-shape 
efficiency curve, as shown in Figure 4.2. Saiyasitpanich et al. (2006) also found a U-shaped collection 
efficiency curve for the wet ESP with a minimum of about 95 % for particles between 80 and 250 nm 
in diameter when the supplied voltage was 70 kV, gas residence time was 0.4 s, and the particle 
concentration was 15.9 mg/Nm

range of 16.8 to 615 nm under different applied voltages at the aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min. As shown 
in the figure, the corn oil particle collection efficiency also shows a U-shape efficiency curve for 
particles from 16.8 to 615 nm in electrical mobility diameter and the efficiency decreases with 
decreasing applied voltage because of the reduction of the electric field strength. When the applied 
voltage was decreased from 4.3 to 4.1 kV, the collection efficiency decreased slightly from 96.9-99.7 
% to 93.9-99.4 %. The collection efficiency was further decreased to 74.2-82.4 % and 11.4-35.5 % for 
the same particle diameter range when the applied voltage was reduced to 3.9 and 3.8 kV, respectively. 
Based on these experimental results, it is certain that the present wet ESP can be operated to efficiently 
control fine and nanosized particles at an aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min, applied voltage of 4.3 kV, and 
scrubbing water flow rate per collection surface area of 2.31 L/min/m
2
.  
Figure 4.4 shows the collection efficiency of the present wet ESP for corn oil particles in the size 
range of 16.8 to 615 nm under different applied voltages at the aerosol flow rate of 10 L/min. The 
collection efficiency can be increased from 86.9-99.4 % to 98.2-100 % when the applied voltage was 
increased from 4.3 to 4.9 kV. This result suggested that the increase of aerosol penetration due to the 
decrease of residence time of particles in ESPs can be diminished by increasing the applied voltage. 
The spark over occurs when the applied voltage is increased to 5.5 kV, which is the operation 
limitation for the present wet ESP.   
In the present wet ESP, high particle collection efficiency (99 %) was found for small 
nanoparticles (16.8 to 29.4 nm) with an applied voltage of 4.3 kV. This is attributed to the high 
electrostatic precipitation efficiency ηelec (dp) and diffusive deposition ηdiff (dp) in this size range, which 
can be calculated by the following equations:

99.4 % to 97.2 % when the particle diameter increased from 16.8 to 615 nm. The diffusive deposition 
was found to be negligible for particles greater than 29.4 nm, and it increased from 4.0 to 17.4 % as 
particles decreased from 29.4 to 16.8 nm. These results demonstrate that diffusive deposition plays an 
important role for very small nanoparticles in the wet ESP.

4.1.3 Particle loading test 
The particle collection efficiency for corn oil particles was tested by the dry and wet ESP at an 
aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min and an applied voltage of 4.3 kV for a long operation time of 10 hours. 
The collection efficiency in the dry ESP was found to decrease only slightly from 99.2-100 % to 
98.7-100 % for 10.4-149 nm particles after the 10-hour test (loaded corn oil: 5.04×10
-5
 mg/plate). 
Particle accumulation on the collected plates and wires was found to be negligible due to the small 
loaded particle mass. Similar tests for the wet ESP also showed that the collection efficiency was as 
high as the initial condition (99.1-98.4 % for 10.4-149 nm particles) after 10-hours of loading corn oil 
particles. Therefore, heavy loading conditions on the collection plates had to be generated by 
dispersing powders, such as TiO2 nanopowder used in this study. 
The collection efficiency was tested for the dry and wet ESP with an aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min, 
an applied voltage of 4.3 kV, and with a TiO2 loading quantity of 0.6±0.06 g/hr/plate (4±0.06 g/m
3
). 
As shown in Figure 4.6, the collection efficiency decreased slightly from 96.9-99.7 % to 92.1-99.3 % 
for electrical mobility diameters of 16.8-615 nm in the dry ESP after 30 minutes of particle loading. 
However, after one hour of loading, the aerosol penetration increased sharply from 0.9-1.6 % to 
12.4-55.4 % for the same range of electrical mobility diameters. The particle collection efficiency 
finally decreased below 35.0 % for all particles (Figure 4.6). This resulted from the reduction of the 
electric field strength due to the accumulation of TiO2 particles on the collected plates and the

26.3 % with increasing particle diameter from 100 to 400 nm, and then decreases from 26.3 % to 0.0 
% particle diameter from 400 to 1500 nm. The numerical results agreed reasonably with the 
experimental data with deviation of 0.54-14.57 % for particles with 100≦dp≦1000 nm.  
    Figure 4.12 shows comparison of the particle collection efficiency between the present numerical 
values and the experimental data of Chang and Bai (1999). In the ESP of Chang and Bai (1999), the 
wire to wire spacing was 300 mm, wire to plate spacing was 60 mm, and wire diameter was 0.5 mm. 
The aerosol flow rate and the applied voltage were 109 L/min and 27.0 kV, respectively. The 
numerical results are also in reasonable agreement with the experimental data in Chang and Bai (1999) 
with deviation of 1.49-12.46 %. These results could be attributed to the fact that Lawless’ model 
predicts particle charges accurately for particles in the continuum charging regime (Kn1) (Lawless 
1997). Lawless concluded that when the electric field strength is very strong, diffusion charging can be 
neglected for particles with dp>1 μm; whereas diffusion charging should never be neglected for 
submicron particles (Marquard 2007). This is a very important conclusion for predicting particle 
charges using combined charging model in the continuum regime.

The present simulated electric potential and ion concentration distribution were also compared to 
the analytical solutions in a wire-in-tube ESP case (Marquard ea al. 2005), and numerical results were 
found to match with analytical solutions as shown in Figure 4.14. Therefore, the present model is able 
to predict electric field strength and ion concentration distribution in ESPs. Figures 4.15 and 4.16 
show the electric potential and the ion density distribution in the wire-in-plate wet ESP at an applied 
voltage of +3.7 kV and an air flow rate was of 5 L/min, respectively. The electric potential is shown to 
be symmetric with respect to the y-axis around the discharge wire. The ion density distribution also 
tends to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis around the discharge wire. The average ion density at 
the outlet of the wet ESP, 7.38×10

and an aerosol flow rate of 100 L/min, as shown in Figure 4.18. In Figure 4.18 (a), high concentration 
of particles carrying zero charge appears at the outlet of the dry ESP. These uncharged particles can’t 
be collected by electrostatic forces on the collection electrodes, and thus penetrate through the ESP. 
The average outlet concentration was calculated to be 8.40×10

average particle charge of 0.04 and an aerosol penetration 
of 33.0 % when the inlet particle concentration was 1.67×10

 m
-3
.  
When the applied voltage was increased to -21.5 kV, the partial charging effect was less severe 
than that at the applied voltage of -15.5 kV. It is because the electric field strength and the ion 
concentration become higher and the particle collection efficiency is enhanced.  
For particles with dp≧20 nm at the applied voltage of -15.5 kV, the average particle charge was 
found to increase from 0.99 to 6.64 with increasing particle diameter from 20 to 100 nm. The partial 
charging effect on the collection efficiency became insignificant. In this size range, high aerosol 
penetration was due to weak electric field strength, which can be reduced by applying higher electric 
filed strength in the ESP.

molecular weights are used. 
Figures 4.20 (a)-(c) show the number concentration distribution of 50 nm particles carrying 0, 1 
and 4 charges in the wet ESP at an applied voltage of +3.7 kV, an air flow rate of 5 L/min, and an ion 
molecular weight of 0.290 kg/mol. As shown in the figure, the concentration of particles with 0 charge 
decreases with increasing x distance from the entrance of the wet ESP, where some particles are 
charged by positive ions to acquire 1-4 charges and some of which are collected by the collection 
electrodes due to electrical force. This can be observed from the location of the highest charged 
particle concentration near the collection electrode surface as shown in Figures 4.20 (b) and (c). 
Besides, large amount of particles carrying 1~4 charges penetrate through the present wet ESP because 
the electrostatic force is not high enough for collecting the charged particles. The average 
concentration of particles at the exit of the wet ESP was calculated to be 8.66×10

+4.3 kV, the partial charging effect became insignificant, and the collection efficiency of particles with 
an average charge of 2.00 reached up to 99 %.

Figure 4.21 shows comparison of the particle collection efficiency between numerical values and 
experimental data for silver particles in the size range of 5.23~107.5 nm. As the figure shows, the 
particle collection efficiency decreased from 64.2 to 36.9 % and 86.9 to 63.7 % with decreasing 
particle diameter from 45.3 to 8.06 nm when the applied voltage were +3.7 and +3.8 kV, respectively. 
The collection efficiency increased from 38.2 to 54.7 % and 63.7 to 68.8 % for particles with diameter 
of 5 nm when the applied voltages were +3.7 and +3.8 kV, respectively. It is because the higher 
diffusion deposition of 5 nm particles than the particles with dp≧8.06 nm. When Fuchs model is 
adopted to calculate the particle charge, the simulated collection efficiencies at the applied voltage 
from +3.7 to +3.9 kV agree with the experimental data with deviation of 0.70-18.9 %, 0.10-19.8 %, 
and 0.10-4.80 %, respectively. At the applied voltage of +3.7-+3.9 kV, the partial charging effect on 
the collection efficiency for particles with dp≦20 nm was found. When the applied voltage was 
increased to +4.3 kV, the partial charging effect on the collection efficiency was diminished due to 
high electric field strength and ion concentration, and the particle collection efficiency reached up to 
97.7-99.8 %.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
5.1 Conclusions 
This study designed and developed a parallel-plate single-stage wet ESP to control fine and 
nanosized particles without the need of rapping. Sand-blasted copper plates coated with TiO2 
nanopowders were used as collection plates to enhance hydrophilicity for the scrubbing water film. A 
pulse jet valve was used to clean the corona wires regularly. Corn oil particles were used to conduct 
particle collection efficiency experiments with different applied voltages and aerosol flow rates under 
an initially clean condition. TiO2 nanopowder was used to create heavy loading conditions to compare 
the particle collection efficiency of the dry and present wet ESP. 
    The experimental results showed that the present wet ESP can be operated to efficiently control 
fine and nanosized particles at an aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min, applied voltage of 4.3 kV and 
scrubbing water flow rate per collection surface area of 2.31 L/min/m
2
 under the initially clean 
condition. 
Under heavy loading conditions with a TiO2 loading quantity of 0.6±0.06 g/hr/plate, the dry ESP 
particle collection efficiency decreased below 35 % for corn oil particles in the electrical mobility 
 53 
nanoparticles with the consideration of nonuniform distribution of flow field, electric field strength 
and ion concentration, which enables the design of efficient electrostatic nanoparticle samplers for 
sampling and characterization of nanoparticles. 
 
5.2 Recommendations 
1. Different shapes of wires such as spiked band, pipe and double-spike, and pipe and double-spike 
were used to decrease the corona onset voltage and increase the ion concentration due to those 
high roughness factors (Jedrusik and Swierczok 2006). The effect of the discharge wires’ shapes 
on the particle collection efficiency in ESPs should be further studied. 
2. The numerical model for predicting particle collection efficiency in ESPs which have discharge 
wires with irregular shape is still in need. A 3-D numerical model needs to be developed to 
simulate the electric field and ion concentration distribution generated by discharge wires of 
different shapes. The particle collection efficiency can be obtained by solving the 3-D 
convection-diffusion equation for the charged particle concentration distribution.

WET ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATOR 39
discussed. Similar types of wire-in-tube wet ESPs were used to
control the emissions of incinerator flue gas (Kim et al. 2000)
and diesel particulate matter (Saiyasitpanich et al. 2006, 2007).
The collection efficiency of particle mass of the wet ESP for 10–
1000 nm diesel particles was measured to be from 92 to 69%
when the gas velocity was from 1.38 to and 5.61 m/s (or the
corresponding residence time from 0.4 to 0.1 s) (Saiyasitpanich
et al. 2007), respectively.
However, the collection efficiency under heavy particle load-
ing conditions for long time periods was not studied. Moreover,
the previous study used a high flow rate of scrubbing water
(4.44–6.22 L/min/m2 of collection area), which resulted in a
thick water film, thus decreasing the electric field strength due
to water’s resistivity.
To improve the uniformity of the liquid film over the collec-
tion electrodes without having to supply the scrubbing water at
high flow rate, Pasic et al. (2001) invented a membrane elec-
trostatic precipitator which used hydrophilic membranes made
of corrosion resistant woven fibers as the collection electrodes.
In the bench scale test, Bayless et al. (2004) compared the
membrane-based and steel plate wet ESPs for the collection
efficiency of fly ash, iron oxide and calcium carbonate having
particle sizes of 20–25, 1–5, and 2–3 µm in diameter, respec-
tively. The collection efficiency of the membrane-based wet
ESP was found to be higher than the steel plate wet ESP. In
the pilot scale test, the membrane wet ESP was used to remove
iron-oxide particles with the peak gas velocity of 4 m/s or the
corresponding residence time of 1.9 s. The collection efficiency
of particle mass was approximately 96% for particles from 1 to
5 µm in diameter. However, the collection efficiency of submi-
cron particles under heavy particle loading conditions was not
discussed. In addition, membranes may be expensive and not all
have uniform wetting and corrosion-resistant properties, which
must be carefully determined for optimal use in specific field
applications (Bayless et al. 2004).
The objective of this study was to develop a wire-in-plate
single-stage wet ESP to enhance the collection efficiency of
fine and nanosized particles. Instead of hydrophilic membranes,
sand blasted copper plates coated with TiO2 nanopowder were
used as the collection plates. The design of the present wet ESP
was aimed at solving the problems of the traditional dry ESPs:
reduction of the collection efficiency due to particle deposi-
tion on the discharge electrodes and collection electrodes, back
corona, and particle re-entrainment. The collection efficiency at
initially clean and heavy particle loading conditions was tested
and compared with that of the dry ESP.
EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Present Parallel-Plate Wet ESP
The collection electrodes of the present parallel plate wet
ESP were designed based the parallel-plate wet denuder in Tsai
et al. (2008). As shown in Figure 1, the wet ESP consists of
two plexiglass plates (M) on which a copper plate (G) (100 mm

in length, 75 mm in width, and 3.0 mm in thickness) was at-
tached to the inner surface. A copper plate was used as collection
electrode because of its high conductivity and ease with sand-
blasting. In order to make scrubbing water film flow uniformly
on the collection electrodes (G) at low flow rates, a frosted glass
plate (FG, 70 mm in length, 75 mm in width, and 3.0 mm in
thickness) coated with TiO2 nanopowder (Degussa AEROXITE
TiO2 P25, Anatase, 20 nm) is attached to the inner surface (M)
above the copper plate. Between the collection electrodes, a
center piece (C) is sandwiched to form a 9 mm gap between
the electrodes. On the center piece, three gold discharge wires
(GW) (99% purity, 100 µm in diameter, Surepure Chemetals
Inc.) spaced at 16 mm in the flow direction are fixed. These gold
wires were used as discharge wires due to their long lifetime of
more than 6 months (Asbach 2004). Two overflowing (OR) and

where Cin(dp) is the particle inlet concentration (#/cm3) and
Cout(dp) is the outlet concentration (#/cm3) for particle of diam-
eter dp.
To study particle loading effect on the collection efficiency
and possible particle reentrainment after particle loading, De-
gussa P25 TiO2 nanopowder (resistivity of 0.75 × 106·cm)
(Salah et al. 2004) was dispersed by a Jet-O-Mizer (Model 000,
Fluid Energy Processing and Equipment Co., Hatfield, UK) at
an aerosol flow rate of 5.67 ∼ 56.62 L/min corresponding to a
mass loading rate of 0.1–100 g/hr as shown in Figure 2. The
particles that penetrated through the ESP (Wout, g) and the par-
ticles in the excess flow (Wex, g) were measured by weighing
the filters at the outlet of the wet ESP and the excess flow. After
loading for two hours, the quantity of particles in the ESP per
plate, Wloaded (g), was then calculated to be 1.2 ± 0.06 g/plate
by the following equation:
Wloaded = Wtotal − Woutlet − Wexcess2 [2]
where Wtotal (g) is the total particle dispersed by the Jet-O-Mizer.
In order to examine the collection efficiency of the present wet
ESP for nanosized particles after 0.5 ∼ 2 h of heavy TiO2
particle loading, corn oil particles were used instead of TiO2
nanopowders (P25) because very few particles below 100 nm
were generated by standard dispersive technique as found in
Tsai et al. (2009). A small-scale powder disperser (SSPD, model
3433, TSI Inc.) was also used to disperse the TiO2 nanopow-
der for conducting the loading test (size distribution is shown
in Table 1). However, the mass concentration was too low to
generate the desired heavy loading condition. Therefore, corn
oil particles generated from the evaporation-condensation tech-
nique were used to test the collection efficiency after heavy TiO2
particle loading.
To examine possible redispersion of particles into gas stream
after heavy TiO2 nanoparticle loading in the dry ESP, a particle
reentrainment test was conducted. After two hours of loading,
clean air at a flow rate of 5 L/min was introduced into the
dry ESP when the applied voltage was 4.3 kV. The scanning
mobility particle sizer (SMPS, model 3081, TSI Inc.) was used
to measure the reentrained particle size distributions at 135 s
sampling interval.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Flow Rate, Uniformity, and Thickness of the Water Film
Surface texture and liquid flow rate are two important factors
that affect the uniformity of the water film (Tsai et al. 2008). As
mentioned previously, the contact angle was greater than 100◦
for the smooth collection electrodes or uncoated sand-blasted
electrodes. It was found that water film on these electrodes was
not uniform. In comparison, for the TiO2 coated, sand-blasted
electrodes, scrubbing water was found to be uniform over the
collection surfaces at the liquid flow rate per collection surface
area (0.075 × 0.17 m2) of 2.31 L/min/m2. Similar findings
were reported by Tsai et al. (2008), Yu et al. (2001), and Liu
et al. (2002). It was also found that channeling occurred when
the liquid flow rate per collection surface area was lower than
2.31 L/min/m2. These findings demonstrate that both surface
texture and liquid flow rate are important for creating a uniform
water film. Comparing with the liquid flow rate of 4.44–6.22
L/min/m2 used by Saiyasitpanich et al. (2006; 2007), the present
design saved 48–63% of the scrubbing water. The thickness
(w) of the water film was calculated to be 0.1 ± 0.18 mm
by the method presented in Tsai et al. (2008). With this small
thickness, the water film was still found to decrease the corona
current compared to a dry ESP with the same design except
without scrubbing water or purge air flows. Figure 3 shows the
comparison of the corona current between the dry and wet ESPs,
at various supplied voltages. It is seen that at the same voltage,
the corona current was decreased after supplying the scrubbing
water on the collection plate surfaces, due to the resistivity
of the water film. Hence, the wet ESP collection efficiency is
expected to be lower than the dry ESP operating at the same
voltage. Therefore, for the initially clean condition the operation
voltage has to be increased for the present wet ESP to have the
same collection efficiency as the dry ESP. As will be shown
later, the advantage of using scrubbing water flow and purge air
flow becomes obvious when the collection surfaces are loaded
heavily with TiO2 nanopowder.
Particle Collection Efficiency of the Wet ESP at Different
Aerosol Flow Rates and Applied Voltages
Figure 4 shows the collection efficiency of the wet ESP as a
function of corn oil diameter when the aerosol flow rate is 5 and
10 L/min and the applied voltage is 4.3 kV under the initially
clean condition. The residence time of the aerosol in the present
wet ESP was calculated to be 0.39 and 0.19 s for aerosol flow
rates of 5 and 10 L/min, respectively. As seen in Figure 4,
decreasing the flow rate from 10 to 5 L/min (or increasing the
residence time from 0.19 to 0.39 s) had a substantial effect on the
collection efficiency as the Deutsch-Anderson equation dictates.

WET ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATOR 43
FIG. 6. Electrostatic precipitation and diffusive deposition efficiencies of the
polydisperse corn oil particles in the present wet ESP when the aerosol flow
rate and the applied voltage are 5 L/min and 4.3 kV, respectively. Each test was
repeated 6 times.
In the present wet ESP, high particle collection efficiency
(99%) was found for small nanoparticles (16.8 to 29.4 nm)
with an applied voltage of 4.3 kV. This is attributed to the
high electrostatic precipitation efficiency ηelec(dp) and diffusive
deposition ηdiff(dp) in this size range, which can be calculated
by the following equations:
ηelec(dp)(%) = ηtotal(dp)(%) − ηdiff(dp)(%)100% − ηdiff(dp)(%) × 100% [3]
ηdiff(dp)(%) = Cin − Cout,OFFCin × 100% [4]
where Cout,OFF is the outlet particle number concentration of
the wet ESP without supplying high voltages. As can be seen
in Figure 6, the electrostatic precipitation efficiency decreased
from 99.4% to 97.2% when the particle diameter increased from
16.8 to 615 nm. The diffusive deposition was found to be neg-
ligible for particles greater than 29.4 nm, and it increased from
4.0 to 17.4% as particles decreased from 29.4 to 16.8 nm. These
results demonstrate that diffusive deposition plays an important
role for very small nanoparticles in the wet ESP.
Particle Loading Test
The particle collection efficiency for corn oil particles was
tested by the dry and wet ESP at an aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min
and an applied voltage of 4.3 kV for a long operation time of
10 hours. The collection efficiency in the dry ESP was found
to decrease only slightly from 99.2–100% to 98.7–100% for
FIG. 7. Collection efficiency for corn oil particles in the dry ESP at different
TiO2 nanopowder loadings. The applied voltage and aerosol flow rate are 4.3
kV and 5 L/min, respectively.
10.4–149 nm particles after the 10-hour test (loaded corn oil:
5.04 × 10–5 mg/plate). Particle accumulation on the collected
plates and wires was found to be negligible due to the small
loaded particle mass. Similar tests for the wet ESP also showed
that the collection efficiency was as high as the initial condition
(99.1–98.4% for 10.4–149 nm particles) after 10 hours of load-
ing corn oil particles. Therefore, heavy loading conditions on
the collection plates had to be generated by dispersing powders,
such as TiO2 nanopowder used in this study.
The collection efficiency was tested for the dry and wet ESP
with an aerosol flow rate of 5 L/min, an applied voltage of 4.3
kV, and with a TiO2 loading quantity of 0.6 ± 0.06 g/hr/plate
(4 ± 0.06 g/m3). As shown in Figure 7, the collection efficiency
decreased slightly from 96.9–99.7% to 92.1–99.3% for electri-
cal mobility diameters of 16.8–615 nm in the dry ESP after 30
min of particle loading. However, after one hour of loading, the
aerosol penetration increased sharply from 0.9–1.6% to 12.4–
55.4% for the same range of electrical mobility diameters. The
particle collection efficiency finally decreased below 35.0% for
all particles (Figure 7). This resulted from the reduction of the
electric field strength due to the accumulation of TiO2 particles
on the collected plates and the discharge wires. As shown in Fig-
ure 3, it is evident that the corona current, and hence the electric
field strength, decreases dramatically under the same applied
voltage after two hours of heavy particle loading because of the
additional resistivity of the dust layer.
Experimental results showed that after two hours of TiO2
nanoparticle loading, the total number concentration of reen-
trained particles was 612.2 #/cm3 (16.8 to 615 nm) at the first

compared with the experimental data of Huang and Chen (2002) for a wire-in-plate 3 
dry ESP (aerosol flow rate: 100 L/min, applied voltage: -15.5~-21.5 kV). Good 4 
agreement was obtained. The simulated particle collection efficiencies were further 5

INTRODUCTION 15 
Wire-in-plate electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are widely used to remove 16 
suspended particles in the exhaust gas because they are capable of handing large flow 17 
rate with low pressure drop through the collection chamber (Oglesby and Nichols 18 
1978). Particles are collected by electrostatic forces, and thus particle electrostatic 19 
 4 
of Li and Christofides (2006), non-uniform electric field and ion concentration were 1 
not considered either and simulated particle collection efficiencies were not compared 2 
with experimental data. Therefore, the applicability of the previous models (Yoo et al. 3 
1997; Zhaung et al. 2000; Li and Christofides 2006) for 30≦dp≦100 nm requires 4 
further investigations. 5 
For particles with dp<30 nm, experimental data (Huang and Chen 2002) and 6 
numerical results (Yoo et al. 1997; Zhaung et al. 2000; Li and Christofides 2006) 7 
showed that a fraction of particles was uncharged and penetrated through the ESPs, 8 
resulting in decreasing collection efficiency as dp was decreased from 30 nm to 5 nm.  9 
This is called the partial charging effect. Marlow and Brock’s model (1975) was 10 
shown to provide accurate prediction of particle charge for dp<30 nm (Pui et al. 1988). 11 
However, Marlow and Brock’s model has not been applied to examine the partial 12 
charging effect on the collection efficiency of the ESP. The combined charging model 13 
used in Yoo et al. (1997) over-predicted particle charge in the transition regime, as 14 
compared to the experimental data of Fjeld and MacFarland (1986), leading to an 15 
overestimation of collection efficiency for particles below 30 nm. The Fuchs model 16 
(1963) used in Zhuang et al. (2000) and Li and Christofides (2006) also 17 
over-predicted particle charge for dp<30 nm, which also led to an overestimation of 18 
the collection efficiency.  19

nano-DMA (differential mobility analyzer, TSI Model 3085) to obtain monodisperse 1 
particles with dp of 10 and 50 nm. The experiment was conducted at an aerosol flow 2 
rate of 5 L/min and at an applied voltage of +3.6~+4.3 kV. A condensation particle 3 
counter (CPC, model 3022, TSI Inc.) was used to measure particle number 4 
concentration. For 10 and 50 nm particles, the inlet concentration of the ESP was 5 
measured to be 1.2×10

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 15 
Characteristics of the V-I curve, electric field and ion concentration distribution 16

concentration distribution in these ESPs. Figures 3 and 4 show the electric potential 1 
and the ion density distribution in the wire-in-plate wet ESP (Lin et al. 2010) at an 2 
applied voltage of +3.7 kV and an air flow rate was of 5 L/min, respectively. The 3 
electric potential is shown to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis around the 4 
discharge wire. The ion density distribution also tends to be symmetric with respect to 5 
the y-axis around the discharge wire. The average ion density at the outlet of the wet 6 
ESP, 7.38×10
-6
 C/m
3
, was calculated to be slightly higher than 4.69×10
-7
 C/m
3
 at the 7 
inlet of the wet ESP due to the influence of air flow convection. The profiles of the 8 
electric potential and the ion concentration distribution in the dry ESP of Huang and 9 
Chen (2002) were found to be similar to those in the wet ESP, and are not shown 10 
here.  11 
Figure 3 12 
Figure 4 13 
Comparing the particle collection efficiency in the dry ESP of Huang and Chen 14 
(2002) 15 
    Figure 5 shows comparison of the particle collection efficiency between the 16 
present numerical values and the experimental data of Huang and Chen (2002). When 17 
the aerosol flow rate and the applied voltage was 100 L/min and -15.5~-21.5 kV, 18 
respectively, the numerical results based on Fuchs model (1963) agreed reasonably 19 
 18 
1988). Therefore, it can be concluded that the model of Marlow and Brock (1975) is 1 
more appropriate than Fuchs model for predicting particle charging and the collection 2 
efficiency in the partial charging regime (dp< 20 nm) in the ESP.  3 
Figure 5 4 
In Figure 5, the ion molecular weight is assumed to be 0.140 kg/mol. The effect 5 
of the ion molecular weight on the particle collection efficiency was also examined in 6 
the present simulation. Table 1 shows molecular weights of positive and negative ions 7 
measured by previous researchers. According to Fuchs theory (1963), the combination 8 
coefficient is related to ion molecular weight (Equation (20)). For negative ions, when 9 
the ion molecular weight increases from the minimum of 0.05 kg/mol to the 10 
maximum of 0.140 kg/mol shown in Table 1, the particle collection efficiency was 11 
found to decrease (data not shown) with decreasing α0 from 3.69×10
-15
~2.13×10
-12 
to 12 
2.85×10
-15
~1.77×10
-12 
for particles with 2≦dp≦100 nm. Good agreement between 13 
the calculated particle collection efficiency and the experimental data was found to 14 
correspond to the ion molecular weight of 0.140 kg/mol. Choosing the minimum ion 15 
molecular weight of 0.05 kg/mol leads to a less than 10 % deviation between the 16 
calculated particle collection efficiencies. For example, when the applied voltage is 17 
-15.5 kV, the calculated particle penetration ranges from 12.4~17.7 % for 10 nm 18 
 20 
diameter from 20 to 100 nm. The partial charging effect on the collection efficiency 1 
became insignificant. In this size range, high aerosol penetration was due to weak 2 
electric field strength, which can be reduced by applying higher electric filed strength 3 
in the ESP. 4 
 5 
Comparing the particle collection efficiency in the present wet ESP (Lin et al. 2010) 6 
Figure 7 shows comparison of the particle collection efficiency between 7 
numerical values and experimental data for 10 and 50 nm NaCl particles in the 8 
present single-stage wire-in-plate wet ESP. As the figure shows, when Fuchs model is 9 
adopted to calculate the particle charge, the simulated collection efficiencies at the 10 
applied voltage of +3.6~+4.3 kV agree with the experimental data with deviation of 11 
0.10-10.8 % and 4.50-14.1 % for 10 and 50 nm particles, respectively. For 10 nm 12 
particles, when the model of Marlow and Brock (1975) is used to calculate the particle 13 
charge, reasonable agreement between the predicted and the experimental collection 14 
efficiency is also obtained with a deviation of 0.10-8.71 %.  15 
Figure 7 16 
In Figure 7, the effect of the ion molecular weight on the particle collection 17 
efficiency is also shown. Within the range of positive ion molecular weight from 18 
0.109 to 0.290 kg/mol, the corresponding α0 and α1 can be calculated based on Fuchs 19

efficiency (Figure 7). When the applied voltage was increased to +4.3 kV, the partial 11 
charging effect became insignificant, and the collection efficiency of particles with an 12 
average charge of 2.00 reached up to 99 %. 13

CONCLUSIONS 15 
This study developed a detailed 2-D mathematical model to predict the flow field, 16 
the electric field strength, the ion concentration, the charged particle concentration 17 
distribution, and the particle collection efficiency in the single-stage wire-in-plate 18 
ESPs. The predicted electric field strength and ion concentration distribution was 19 
 24 
nonuniform distribution of flow field, electric field strength and ion concentration, 1 
which enables the design of efficient electrostatic nanoparticle samplers for sampling 2 
and characterization of nanoparticles. 3

 Annual conference,  
2008 年美國氣膠學會年會, 美國 Orlando, Florida 
2008 年 10 月 17 日至 2008 年 10 月 24 日止 
 
2009 美國氣膠學會年會 AAAR 28th Conference, 美國, Minneapolis 
2009 年 10 月 24 日至 98 年 10 月 31 日 
 
一、參加會議經過 
本計畫共參加以上的三個研討會,含美國及歐洲氣膠研討會, 目的在於瞭解國際
上各國研究學者對於空氣污染懸浮微粒的控制技術、奈米微粒的生成、奈米微粒
的物理化學特性、奈米微粒對於人體的危害及奈米微粒採樣技術的研究現況作深
作的瞭解, 並以口頭報告發表本人的各種研究成果, 與全世界的學者專家作交
流。 
討論的議題內容包含下列主題 
Aerosol Based Nanotechnology 
Aerosol Chemistry 
Aerosol Fundamentals 
Aerosol Instrumentation 
Aerosol Modeling 
Atmospheric Aerosols 
Electrical Effects Radioactive Aerosols 
High Temperature Aerosols  
Lung Particles Interaction 
PMx 
effects, Atmospheric aerosol-optical properties, Special session: fluctuations and 
atmospheric aerosols, Indoor aerosols, Combustion aerosols-boilers, Aerosol 
modeling-processes and technology, PM10/PM2.5-characterisation 等等。 
 
三、建議 
 氣膠科技在國際上主要的研究以大氣污染和奈米材料有關的課題為主，美
國、德國、日本、韓國有些學者在氣膠微粒核凝成長的理論及實驗研究、氣膠的
呼吸治療技術，電氣噴霧合成奈米微粒科技及其應用技術，奈米粉體合成等均有
很多品質很高的研究在進行，值得我們效法。近年來，由於奈米科技的蓬勃發展，
奈米材料也大量的被產生跟製造，相對地奈米微粒對環境或人體健康上的危害評
估應是相當重要的課題，歐盟及美國對這些題都有提出較前瞻的報告，或訂定法
規來管制這些奈米材料，將奈米材料當成毒性物質來管理，就是從生產、運送、
儲存、使用及處置的整個生命週期來管理奈米材料，這些法規是我國環保機關可
拿來使用，也當作我國管制奈米材料的辦法。 
 台灣學生普遍口語及聽力能力不足，未來如果有機會，學校應可多鼓勵學生
出國進行學術交流，除了學習到專業技術的知識，也可提昇的英文能力。
