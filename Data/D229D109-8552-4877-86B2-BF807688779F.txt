二、研究目的 (Objective) 
It is highly appreciated that this first NSC grant I have received since I returned to Taiwan to 
serve for NCKU supported my re-establishment of basic research tools including a plasma enhanced 
CVD system and some characterization facilities in an originally completely empty laboratory.  Based 
on the primitive equipment and fortunately quite good shared characterization equipment at NCKU, 
the following research topics have been carried out in the past three years: (i) Synthesis and 
characterization of charge-transfer doped intrinsic diamond thin films and their semiconductor and 
electrochemical properties, (ii) Characterization of boron doped semiconductor diamond in 
comparison with intrinsic diamond for their electrical properties and charge transfer reactions, (iii) 
Characterization and enhancing electrical and electrochemical performance of semiconductor diamond 
by hydrogen plasma and air plasma treatments, (iv) Synthesis and characterization of diamond, carbon 
nanowalls, and graphene hybrid electrochemical electrodes and field enhanced cold cathodes.

ionic charges in the adsorbate is shown in Figure 4c.  Unlike H-terminated diamond, O-terminated 
diamond has positive electron affinity, i.e. the conduction band minimum is below the vacuum energy 
level.  The valence band maximum of an O-terminated diamond is lower than the chemical potential 
of water adlayer on the diamond surface.  Electron transfer from diamond to the adsorbate layer does 
not occur.  P-type conductivity does not exist for O-terminated intrinsic diamond.   It is electrically 
insulating, instead. 
 
 
Figure 1a. Energy diagram of diamond surfaces terminated with hydrogen and diamond surfaces 
terminated with oxygen with respect to electrochemical potential of water adlayers with different pH 
values.  Diamond surfaces terminated with hydrogen have negative electron affinity causing the 
valance band maximum of diamond to be above the electrochemical potential of water adlayer and 
allowing valance electrons to tunnel from diamond surfaces to the water adlayer.

other causes the surface morphologies of a BDD film to change irreversibly.  Surface treatments 
aiming at improved electrochemical performance of BDD electrodes containing non-diamond carbons 
are more complicated than those for high-quality microcrystalline BDD.  BDD with deep-sub-micron 
diamond grains grown at 700
o
C is etched by plasma in air and hydrogen.  Non-diamond carbons, 
surface morphologies, surface functionalities, and crystalline quality of diamond grains are examined 
by Raman scattering, XPS, and SEM in correlation with electrochemical reactions measured by cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) in the ferri/ferrocyanide redox system.  The Ferri/ferrocyanide redox system is 
chosen to probe the BDD electrode because it’s highly sensitivity to the surface functionalities of 
BDD.  
Cold cathodes are capable of emitting electron at room temperature and are, therefore attractive 
for many applications ranging from back-lighting for flat panel displays, high brightness lamps with 
selective wavelength, to high power microwave tubes.  Carbon nanostructures such as carbon 
nanotubes and carbon nanowalls exhibit high aspect ratios and, therefore, are promising for electron 
field emission at room temperature.  One-dimensional nanocarbons such as carbon nanotubes are 
formed by single or multiple layers of graphene-like cylindrical nanostructures and possess very high 
aspect ratios (ratio of length to diameter or radius of curvature), which result in enhancement of local 
electric fields at the tips of carbon nanotubes by hundreds to thousands of times as compared to the 
average applied electric field [36].  The strong local electric field at the tips of carbon nanotubes 
causes the turn-on of electron field emission at an average applied electric field of one or few volts per 
micrometers.  
When distance between individual carbon nanotubes is small compared to their  length, the 
screening effect on local electric field by close neighboring carbon nanotubes reduces the extend of 
field enhancement.  The turn-on electric field for electron field emission from such a carbon nanotube 
forest increases as a result.  When carbon nanotubes are of different lengths, the longer carbon 
nanotubes, which are more probable to stand out from among neighboring ones, enjoy the highest local 
electric field and as a result emit electrons at a lower applied electric field.  This competition delays

四、研究方法 (Approaches) 
Experimental research was carried out to synthesize and study p-type diamond by the following 
approaches: (i) Synthesis and characterization of charge-transfer doped intrinsic diamond thin films 
and their semiconductor and electrochemical properties, (ii) Characterization of boron doped 
semiconductor diamond in comparison with intrinsic diamond for their electrical properties and charge 
transfer reactions, (iii) Characterization and enhancing electrical and electrochemical performance of 
semiconductor diamond by hydrogen plasma and air plasma treatments, (iv) Synthesis and 
characterization of diamond, carbon nanowalls, and graphene hybrid electrochemical electrodes and 
field enhanced cold cathodes.  Raman scattering, PL, XRD, XPS, OES, SEM were applied to 
characterize synthesized diamond films in correlation with their physical and chemical properties for 
practical applications.

Hydrogenation of diamond grains of a microcrystalline diamond film improves its electrical

charge-transfer doped intrinsic diamond a good candidate for biochemical sensors applications.  
When compared to platinum electrodes, hydrogen terminated intrinsic diamond electrodes have much

Diamond film, the high electrical resistance limits the measurable reaction current to an 
insignificant value. The intrinsic diamond grown in hydrogen-rich methane plasma has its surface 
terminated by hydrogen and is therefore conductive to certain extent. This allows the electrochemical 
reaction current to flow through the circuit to display the measured I-V curve shown in Fig. 4(a). After 
the oxygen-terminated intrinsic diamond is re-hydrogenated by hydrogen plasma, more hydrogen 
coverage of the diamond surface is achieved and the surface conductivity becomes higher than that of 
the as-grown diamond.  This is reflected by the higher measured electrochemical reaction current 
shown in Fig. 4(a).  Fig. 4(b) shows the electrochemical reactivity of the re-hydrogenated intrinsic 
diamond electrode based on its cyclic voltammetry measured at different scan rates of 20 mV/s,

 solution (Fig. 9(a)).  The BDD also exhibits a low background 
signal and a wide potential window as shown by the wide and flat horizontal line in Fig. 8(b) by CV 
measurements in 0.1M H2SO4.  Based on the material, crystallinity , structural, and CV measurements, 
the smooth and low-temperature HFCVD BDD is a useful electrochemical electrode for integrated 
sensor applications.      
 
Air plasma etched BDD 
Oxidation of high-quality single-crystal and microcrystalline BDD is known to reduce the already 
sluggish charge transfer reactions in the ferri/ferrocyanide redox system compared to properly polished 
glassy carbon (GC) and pretreated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with high density of 
edge planes.  Air plasma modifies the BDD by preferential oxidation and etching of non-diamond 
carbons and ion bombardment to the diamond surface.  The etching of non-diamond carbons in the 
grain boundaries causes the diamond grain to expose its crystal facets originally covered by 
non-diamond carbons in the grain boundaries.  Ion bombardment assists in the oxidation and etching 
of diamond grains to sharpens the diamond grains.  Oxidation of the diamond surfaces increases the 
contents of C=C bonds on the diamond surfaces.  Fig. 5(b) displays recessed grain boundaries and 
diamond ”pits” after air plasma etching for 60 minutes.  UV Raman spectrum excitation by 325 nm 
light (Fig. 6(b)) is similar to that of as-received BDD.  The intensity ratio of IG/IDia of 0.6 is about 
10% lower than that of the as-received BDD, indicating that non-diamond carbons are preferentially 
etched by air plasma.  Raman spectrum excited by 633 nm light (Fig. 7(b)) exhibits intensity ratio, 
IG/ID, of 0.721, which is much higher than that of as-received BDD due to oxidation and ion 
bombardment modification of BDD.   
XPS measurements show that the oxygen content after 60-minute air plasma etching increases 
from 10% to 35.8%.  The atomic percentage of C=C bonds (Fig. 8(c)) decreases from 25.4% to 9.6%.  
Besides the majority C-C bonds, carbons are in the form of 19.2% C-O and 12.4% C=O bonds.  
Oxygen termination on the air plasma etched BDD are expected to block charge transfer in the 
ferri/ferrocyanide redox system. This is not shown in the case of BDD containing high density of 
 24 
 
diamond grains (Fig. 5(c)).  Etching of grain boundaries by hydrogen plasma is not as extensive as air 
plasma does.  UV Raman (325 nm) spectrum (Fig. 6(c)) appears similar to that of as-received BDD.  
The intensity ratio IG/IDia is 0.59, which is the lowest one compared to as-received (0.659) and air 
plasma etched (0.6) BDD.  Raman (633 nm) spectrum (Fig. 7(c)) shows the IG/ID ratio to be the 
lowest of 0.257 and close to that for the as-received (0.265) and much lower than that of air plasma 
etched (0.721) BDD.  XPS shows that the atomic percentage of oxygen on the BDD decreases from 
10% for as-received BDD to 2% after the 60-minutes of hydrogen plasma etching.  Hydrogen plasma 
etching does not alter the ratio of C=C bonds (27.7%) to C-C (72.3%) bonds much from that of 
as-receive BDD (Fig. 8c).  Hydrogen terminated BDD has little oxygen to block the charge transfer 
for the ferri/ferrocyanide redox system.  One would expect the reaction current to be much higher 
than air plasma etched BDD.  The reaction current (Fig. 9(a)) does increase from that of as-received 
BDD but the increase is less than that for air plasma etched BDD.  This trend is opposite to that for 
high-quality large-grain microcrystalline BDD in the ferri/ferrocyanide redox system.  It is a 
consequence of the high contents of non-diamond carbons and defects in the BDD.  The etching of 
grain boundaries by hydrogen plasma is not as deep as air plasma does according to the SEM 
photographs in Fig. 1.  The diamond grains are not sharpened to form diamond pits as air plasma does.  
The increased effective surface area of the electrode is not as much as that by air plasma etching.  
Although having increased hydrogen terminated active sites for electrochemical reactions, the small 
increase in effective electrode surface area and the presumably less extensive activation of 
non-diamond carbons are believed to result in enhancement of electrochemical reaction rate from that 
of as-received BDD not as much as air plasma etching does (Fig 9(a)).  The hydrogen plasma etched 
BDD exhibits low background signals with a slightly wider potential window than that of as-received 
and air plasma etched BDD (Fig. 9(b)).

3. Carbon-nanowall cold cathodes fabricated by plasma CVD in methane and hydrogen: 
Carbon nanowalls have been grown in various substrates.  Silicon is a convenient substrate 
mainly because of its high purity, quality, and wide availability. Shown in Figure 10 are Raman spectra 
of carbon films ranging from diamond to carbon nanowalls grown on as-is silicon substrates using the 
same experimental apparatus described in the previous section.  Laser light of 532 nm was used for 
the excitation for Raman characterization.  A mixture of hydrogen and methane is fed to the DC 
plasma enhanced CVD reactor at a total flow rate of 100 sccm.  The DC discharge current was 1A at 
a gas pressure of 120 Torr and substrate temperatures between 790 and 833
o
C.  The growth time for 
all samples was one hour.  When the methane concentration was 2% in the gas mixture, diamond was 
grown on the silicon substrate as indicated by the sharp diamond Raman peak at 1332cm
-1
.  As 
methane concentration increases, the intensity of the diamond Raman peak decreases while the 
intensity of the graphite structure related G-band around 1580 cm
-1 
in the Raman spectra became 
stronger and stronger with the defect related D-band signal around 1350 cm
-1
 becoming more evident.  
When a graphite-like structure has an irregular structure with relative low defect density, another band 
called D’-band at around 1620 cm-1 appears.  As the graphitization of a carbon film becomes more 
and more perfect, the G-band becomes stronger and sharper while the D-band signal decreases in 
intensity.   At the methane concentration of 6-10%, the D-band and G-band of the Raman spectra 
show characteristics similar to those reported for carbon nanowalls.  The smaller the ratio of the 
D-band signal to the G-band signal, the larger the graphite domains are in the carbon nanowalls.  
In this work, we chose graphite substrates to grow carbon nanowalls in order to fabricate 
all-carbon cold cathodes.  The same DC plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process used for 
depositing carbon films on silicon was applied to the growth of carbon nanowalls on graphite 
substrates.  All specimens prepared on graphite substrates being reported in this paper were carried 
out at 120 Torr reactor pressure, under 720 volts applied voltage and 1 Ampere DC discharge current 
flowing between the specimen holder of 1cm in diameter and a molybdenum anode of 2cm in diameter 
which was placed at a distance of 3cm from the specimen in a gas mixture of 8% methane diluted by 
 32 
 
specimens were grown simultaneously.  As a comparison, a Raman spectrum for a carbon nanowall 
specimen grown under the same conditions on an as-is silicon substrate shown in Figure 9 is also 
shown in Figure 11.  Raman spectra showed that carbon nanowalls grown on nanodiamond particles 
coated graphite substrates have a higher ratio of the D-band signal to that of the G-band as compared 
to carbon nanowalls grown on as-is silicon and as-is graphite substrates.  This implies that the 
nano-graphite domains in carbon nanowalls grown on nanodiamond particles coated graphite 
substrates are smaller compared to those grown on as-is silicon and graphite substrates. 
For both types of graphite substrates, the deposited carbon clearly showed micro-flowers like 
micro-nano-structures with sharp edges which are similar to previously reported carbon nanowalls or 
carbon nanoflakes.  Distance between sharp edges of graphite flowers is determined roughly by the 
size of micro-flowers and is comparable with the height of the micro-flowers.   This is desirable for 
minimizing the screening effect on local electric field and allowing the high aspect ratio (height to 
thickness ratio of the graphite sheets) of the graphite micro-nano-structures to play the role of creating 
much higher local electric fields at those sharp edges of the micro-nano-graphite structures than the 
applied average electric field calculated by dividing the applied voltage between the anode and the 
cathode by the distance between these two electrodes.  
To study the cold cathode applications of carbon nanowalls grown on graphite substrates, electron 
field emission current density was measured versus applied electric field (J-E) as shown in Figure 4.  
An anode made of a tungsten rod of 1mm in diameter was placed at a distance from a carbon 
nanowalls coated specimen, which serves as the cathode for the measurement.  The tungsten anode 
was inserted in an electrically insulating and machineable ceramic block with the anode surface 
adjusted and aligned to the surface of the ceramic block.  Two glass cover sheets of 140 μm in 
thickness were placed between the ceramic block and the carbon nanowalls substrate so as to allow the 
determination of the distance between the tungsten anode and the carbon nanowalls cathode.  The 
electrode assembly was placed inside a vacuum chamber which was evacuated to a pressure of 10
-6 
Torr or lower by means of a turbomolecular pump back by a rotary mechanical pump.

（英文） 
Enhancement of charge transfer reaction rate of deep sub-micron 
boron-doped diamond film as an electrochemical electrode by plasma 
etching in hydrogen and in air has been demonstrated. Polycrystalline 
boron-doped-diamond (BDD) films with deep sub-micron grains  
exhibit smooth and mirror-like surfaces and retain most 
electrochemical properties of high-quality microcrystalline BDD.  
They exhibit low background current and wide potential windows.   
Plasma treated polycrystalline boron doped diamond electrochemical 
electrode is an excellent compromise to replace high crystalline 
microcrystalline diamond films with large diamond grains and rough 
surfaces which require high-temperature synthesis and expensive 
polishing for applications to integrated electrochemical sensor circuits.

三、交流活動 
Except the banquet mentioned previously, I did not attend other activities due to tight travel schedule. 
四、建議 
One thing that is missing in this workshop is papers co-authored by scientists from Mainland China, 
Hong Kong, and Taiwan.  During the inviting remarks for CSWNT-9 in Taiwan in 2011, I proposed that 
we offer Cross Strait Collaborative Research Awards in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in the next 
workshop in 2011. Chinese government invested a lot of money to recruit outstanding scientists, mainly 
Chinese, from around the world and support them with very sizable funds and salaries.  The return for 
investment is showing up now and will be even more obvious in years to come.  Taiwan authority has a 
very challenging issue to deal with and to prevent the further erosion of the academic and industrial 
strengths, in comparison with Mainland China and Hong Kong, we have worked so hard to establish in 
the past twenty years or so.
