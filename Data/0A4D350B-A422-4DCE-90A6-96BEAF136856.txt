Abstract 
In conventional machining, drilling is the most 
applied method accounting for as much as 40% for all 
material removal processes. However, problems in 
drilling, particularly the heterogeneity and anisotropy 
of composite materials, increase delamination. Several 
studies have proved that delamination is related to the 
thrust force in drilling composite materials. The thrust 
force of compound core drill with drilling parameters 
(diameter ratio, feed rate and spindle speed) in drilling 
carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates 
were experimentally investigated in this study. The 
results indicate that diameter ratio and feed rate have 
the most significant influence on the overall 
performance of compound core drills produces the 
highest drilling thrust force. The advantages of the 
compound core drill design are that the thrust force 
exerted is distributed toward the drill periphery in 
drilling. The diameter ratio may be a viable alternative 
for the compound core drill in terms of drilling thrust.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Composite materials are used in industrial fields, 
such as aerospace, aircraft, automobile and sports, 
owing to their advantages in mechanical properties. 
However, it is difficult to machine composite 
materials with high efficiency to yield good-quality 
products. Conventional drilling with twist drill still 
remains one of the most economical and efficient 
machining processes for hole making as well as for 
riveting and fastening structural assemblies in the 
aerospace and automotive industries. During the past 
four decades, researches have developed many types 
of drills, including multifacet drill, saw drill, 
candlestick still, core drill, step drill and trepanning 
drill, all aimed at making better holes. With increasing 
demand for advanced composite materials, not only 
new concepts of tooling but also different realms of 
cutting conditions are needed. The compound core 
drill was developed for the same reason. Delamination 
is the most common defect during drilling due to the 
heterogeneity of both fibers and matrix. A few studies 
have proved that delamination is related to the thrust 
force in drilling composite materials [1-3]. The 
contribution of chisel edge to the thrust force for twist 
drill is often up to 40 to 60 percent of the total thrust 
force [4]. The shorter the chisel edge, the smaller the 
thrust force will be. Pre-drilled, back-up plates and 
special drills can reduce delamination when drilling 
composite materials [5-13]. Armarego and Wright [14] 
found that the effects of feed rates, spindle speeds and 
the geometrical characteristics of the three drills on 
the resulting torque and thrust values are comparable 
regardless of the three different drill flank 
configurations used. DiPaolo et al. [15] conducted an 
experiment to investigate the size of delamination 
region during drilling, which is confirmed to be 
related to the thrust force developed at the drill exit. 
Most of the published and manufacturers’ literature 
correlates the drill material, drill geometry and feed 
rate to the delamination produced by twist drill 
[16-22]. Hocheng and Tsao [3] compared theoretical 
predictions of critical thrust force with experiment 
results at the onset of delamination for various drills, 
such as saw drill, candlestick drill, core drill and step 
drill. They found that among various drills, core drill 
allows for the largest drilling feed rate to avoid 
delamination. In general, the core drill is applied for 
drilling hard brittle materials, as in civil engineering 
structure, jewels and glass. However, the removal of 
chips poses problems when using the core drill. To 
resolve this, the compound core drill is designed to 
reduce chip removal in drilling. Different compound

thrust force of various compound core drills. By using 
the ANOVA in Table 1, suitable mathematical 
equations can be derived as follows: 
(A) Thrust force of compound core-twist drill ( WF ) 
SW NfF
21011.377.201.6977.187 −×−+−= β  (1) 
891.02 =R  
(B) Thrust force of compound core-candlestick drill 
( CF ) 
SC NfF
21061.317.345.9310.112 −×−+−= β  (2) 
935.02 =R  
(C) Thrust force of compound core-saw drill ( SF ) 
SS NfF
21002.424.356.10432.125 −×−+−= β  (3) 
946.02 =R  
where β  is the diameter ratio in mm/mm, f is the 
feed rate in mm/min and SN  is the spindle speed in 
rpm. 
In addition to performing the ANOVA analysis, a 
semi-empirical equation is obtained by applying a 
relationship originally developed by Shaw and Oxford 
for the drilling of metallic materials [25-26]. They 
found that the thrust force ( F ) was related to the feed 
rate (f) and diameter of the drill (d) using the 
following equations: 
dKdfKF 2
1
1 )( += −α      (4) 
where 1K , 2K  and α  are the empirical constants. 
The constants, 1K , 2K  and α , determined the 
magnitudes of the drilling forces. With Eq. (4) 
developed by Shaw and Oxford, the semi-empirical 
equation for thrust force of various compound core 
drills was derived as follows: 
(A) Thrust force of compound core-twist drill ( EWF ) 
ββ 24.118)(83.72 26.0 −= fF EW    (5) 
720.02 =R  
(B) Thrust force of compound core-candlestick drill 
( ECF ) 
ββ 14.150)(22.93 24.0 −= fF EC    (6) 
778.02 =R  
(C) Thrust force of compound core-saw drill ( ESF ) 
ββ 40.162)(09.102 23.0 −= fF ES    (7) 
776.02 =R  
Among the three drills, the compound core-saw 
drill offers the highest drilling thrust force followed 
by the compound core-candlestick drill and the 
compound core-twist drill due to their higher 1K , 2K  
and lower α  values. 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
An experimental analysis for thrust force 
associated with various compound core drills in 
drilling of composite materials is presented in this 
study. The following conclusions can be drawn from 
the above investigation: 
(1) Compound core-saw drill offers the highest 
drilling thrust force compared with other drills. As 
seen in ultrasonic C-scan images, the diameter 
ratio of compound core drill influences the thrust 
force when drilling composite materials. 
(2) The two major cutting parameters affecting thrust 
force of various compound core drills is the 
diameter ratio and feed rate. The thrust force of 
various compound core drills increase with 
decrease in diameter ratio and increase in feed 
rate. 
(3) Within the selected cutting range, the combination 
of high diameter ratio (0.74 mm/mm), low feed 
rate (8 mm/min) and high speed (1200 rpm) would 
be the best experimental conditions when drilling 
CFRP laminates. 
(4) A good correlation between thrust force and 
cutting parameters can be obtained by linear 
regression analysis and semi-empirical model.
