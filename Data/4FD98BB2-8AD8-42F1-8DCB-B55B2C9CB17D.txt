 II 
Discussion on the Application of the Greenhouse Agricultural and Fishery 
Co-existing System 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Life wisdom and accumulated experience can contribute to technological 
development in agriculture, industry and commerce. In the evolutionary process of 
industries, people engage in economic activities to achieve a better quality of life, a 
higher quality of medical treatment, and a prolonged lifespan. However, the 
exploitation of virgin forests and pollution from industrial factories have caused 
damage to the ecological environment, resulting in global warming, climatic 
anomalies, and an unbalanced food chain, which have indirectly contributed to a food 
crisis.  
This study discussed how to apply refrigeration air-conditioning systems, which 
provide refrigeration and heating during operation, to fish-vegetable coexisting 
systems, by sending the temperature feedback signal to PLC control model, and 
according to the indoor temperature setting conditions, the required cold and heat 
energy could be provided in real-time, so as to plant vegetables and fruit, as well as 
breed fishes of high economic value, in existing greenhouses. The proposed method 
can diversify the agriculture and fish industry, overcome the problems of seasons and 
environments, and achieve out-of-season culture and cultivation. In order to protect 
the environment, and to allow the agriculture and fish breeding industries to be more 
complementary, the feasibility of applying refrigerant circulation systems to 
fish-vegetable coexisting systems was studied.

第 2章 研究目的 
    由於人口持續增加，科技日益發達，土地被無限制的開發，經濟活動頻繁，
相關的物理化學污染愈益嚴重，導致全球動植物生長環境變遷，進而影響整體生
物鏈異常，許多物種甚至瀕臨絕種危機。然而台灣對於農業的技術發展，累積了
相當程度的經驗，不管是品種改良或者種苗培育，擁有著豐碩成果，但傳統耕耘
皆處於室外，受到各種季節天候的影響，產生不同的自然災害，加上大部分的農
業作物皆有季節性生長限制，作物收成不見得可達預期；且台灣位居亞熱帶，四
周環海，氣候四季多變，加上現今大氣環境已經跟十年前差異很大，溫室效應產
生之反聖嬰現象，世界各地異相頻頻，此種多變的氣候條件造成作物產量不穩定
及品質的不良，這就是我們適合發展溫室的主因。 
    溫室有機農業栽培基本上分為「有土栽培」、「無土栽培」或「水耕栽培」，
傳統農作物栽培方式是將種子置放於土壤中，由土壤提供植物所需的養份，並搭
配外在的陽光及水分，然而土壤的養份很難調整控制，且深層土壤内病蟲害也難
以根除，致使農作物豐收不易。近年來隨著生物科技的進步，使用「無土栽培」
或「水耕栽培」方式，被廣泛的應用於各種農作物栽培上，一般水耕栽培的優點
為縮短生長期，並提高年產量，避免土壤病蟲害，節省勞力成本支出，並能提高
農作物品質及安全；於是乎，近幾年「魚菜共生系統」在國際學術上被廣泛性的
發表推廣，且農漁業相關的產業亦搭配應用此共生系統。「魚菜共生系統」理論
上就是人們從大自然生物間的和諧，帄衡地進行物質能量轉換現象中，得到啟發
而形成的一種仿生栽培養殖技術；它是基於自然界物種間的共生互惠原理，再採
用人工與高密度集約化技術後，所形成的一種工廠化種植與養殖模式。但是，依
目前市面上所見到「魚菜共生系統」的應用，仍處於在單一溫室內且提供單一溫
度的環境條件下，種植植物或養殖魚類。

Abstract—In the past, for the imbalance class distribution, in 
most cases the representative class data were chosen by 
sampling, in order to improve the efficacy of the class 
distribution model in predicting the minority of classes in the 
imbalanced data set. The research attempts to present a new 
pre-processing method of data—the Orthogonal 
Transformation Method (OTM), which, by integrating the 
conceptions of Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays, without 
changing the original data structure, improves the 
Orthogonality of the data structure by adding variables so 
that the accuracy of the automatic class distribution 
database of IC products of imbalanced data set is improved, 
the range of information retrieval is accurately narrowed, 
the efficiency and the quality of retrieval can be exalted to a 
great extent and thus the performance of IC design is 
upgraded. For the first year, the programs to be 
implemented and expected results are: Orthogonal 
Transformation Method, programming and performance 
evaluation.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In the IC product design and development process, the 
selection of IC encapsulation pattern is as important to IC 
designers as the decision of construction techniques for the 
main building structure to architects. In other words, IC 
designers have to select the proper IC encapsulation 
pattern to be able to make choice of subsequent IC chip 
design patterns and manufacturing procedures accordingly. 
Therefore, provision of most accurate related information 
regarding IC encapsulation pattern as soon as possible to 
IC designers can not only correctly determine the IC 
design method but also dramatically reduce the risks of 
subsequent operations. The main purpose of the present 
study is, by integrating currently available relevant 
information regarding IC encapsulation pattern including 
size, features, design principles and application principles, 
to set up IC encapsulation product classification principles 
by application of data mining and help IC encapsulation 
product manufacturers to establish a prototype of IC 
encapsulation classification system, which may render 
clients, business personnel, customer service staffs or the 
management personnel able to rapidly and accurately 
obtain desired information. 
II. RESEARCH BACKGROUND  
In recently years, the semiconductor industry was hit 
by the global financial crisis, and the major semiconductor 
enterprises were affected to different extents. On condition 
that the global semiconductor growth tended to be 
conservative, Taiwan's semiconductor industry was also 
facing unprecedented challenges. In general, the cost of 
semiconductor parts accounts for more than 60-70% of 
that of total parts in the system products. Main problems 
arising from IC design and manufacture include: IC itself 
or IC package. 
In general, an IC design company has more talents, and 
can solve the problems of the IC itself and Fab process 
through the cooperation between test engineers and 
engineers being familiar with Fab process. However, IC 
design companies face bottlenecks when the problems 
seem not to be the IC itself because it is generally difficult 
for IC design companies to recruit engineers with 
integrated IC package knowledge. In other words, IC 
package structure and technical capacity of package are the 
key elements in IC design and production process. 
Therefore, at present, all IC design engineers are facing the 
challenge of how to accurately obtain package information 
of IC products and select the most appropriate package 
type, so as to reduce the cost and design period. 
In the past, part of the classification database 
prototypes of IC package products were established using 
the data mining and automatic classification technology, so 
as to help customer service personnel of package 
manufacturers to provide IC design engineers with simple 
product information (IC package type) with the aid of an 
automatic classifier [1, 2]. However, the problem of 
imbalanced class distribution exists in actual product data 
of the currently completed classification model of the 
product database, thereby affecting the efficiency of the 
classifier. This study proposed a new data preprocessing 
algorithm -orthogonal transformation method (OTM), 
which could enhance the orthogonality of the product data 
structure through new variables based on the concept of 
Taguchi orthogonal array and without changing the 
frequently used sampling methods include: (a) decrease of 
the majority (b) increase of the minority and (c) multiple 
expert classifier. 
IV. RESEARCH METHOD 
A. Data preprocessing-orthogonal transformation 
method 
This study proposed a new data preprocessing 
algorithm- orthogonal transformation method (OTM), 
which could enhance the orthogonality of the product data 
structure through new variables based on Taguchi 
orthogonal array and without changing the original data 
structure. The algorithm could improve the classification 
accuracy in automatic classification database of IC 
products of imbalanced data sets. When the orthogonality 
between variables in the data set is increased, 
distinguishability between the data is also increased. In 
other words, if the original data are saved, the orthogonal / 
distinguishable effect of the data set can be increased in the 
following steps: 
1. Assuming that the data set ),( AUIS   contains 2T  
category with a large amount of data and 1T  category 
with a small amount of data. 
2. U ={ 1x , 2x  , nx } is a data set, 
A ={ 1a , 2a  , pa } is attribute variables, aVa  , 
aV  the value set of a . 
3. U is divided into two separate subsets 1D  and 2D , 
1D ={
2' ),( Uxx  | Aa   
4. Let B be an orthogonal dummy variable 
5. Based on data items [ ix  ib ] of 
'
1D , a dummy variable 
K of 2D  is established, KB, and '2D =[ 2D  K ] is 
completed.

B. Evaluation of classification models 
In general, training data account for 80% of the 
original data, while the remaining 20% of the data is 
regarded as the test data. The main advantage of this 
method is easy data processing, but it is not applicable to 
the situation with a small amount of data. In addition, 
cross-validation method divides the data into m parts with 
equivalent size using k-fold-cross-validation, and k groups 
of the data are mutually exclusive. For example, the datum 
R is divided into m parts 1R , 2R  , ..., mR . m  training 
and testing stages must be repeated using this method. 
Each time one group of iR  there of is regarded as the test 
data, the remaining data are regarded as the training data to 
validate its accuracy. After repeating m times, final 
accuracy of this model is obtained through averaging the 
accuracies in the m times. This method takes more time 
than the holdout method, and is less applicable to the 
situation with a large amount of data. In order to validate 
the feasibility of OTM, before this study, the IC package 
family (FCLGA Package Family, FCCSP Package Family, 
QFN Package Family and SOP Package Family) is 
established in advance. Classification-based prediction 
results of these families are compared under the same 
conditions respectively based on the original dataset and 4 
groups of different OTM dummy variable groups. 
According to the preliminary results of the experiments, as 
shown in TABLE II, classification accuracy of the training 
data set can be effectively improved using the OTM of 
different dummy variables, but that of the test data set 
varies greatly. The results indicated that the combination 
of dummy variables has significant effect on the 
classification results.

(英文) Aquaponics is a technique involved with the controls on the environments of the plants 
and fishes growth.Acquaponics adopts its recycled water system and bio-filtration system 
to make up the shortcomings of the closed aquaculture which requires a lot changing the 
water to stabilize the water quality and discharges a large amount of sewage water. After 
discharged, the culture sewage can be recycled through the sedimentation, filtration, 
purification plants,and temperature adjustment. The above is an important part of a 
natural sewage treatment. The proposal synthesizes the literature of aquaculture and 
sewage treatment at home and abroad in recent years to create an environment which is 
able to control the growth conditions for plants and fish. The analysis of the above 
processes and the feasibility will be explored via a recirculating aquaculture system 
which is built based on the theory of eco-symbiotic complementarity.
