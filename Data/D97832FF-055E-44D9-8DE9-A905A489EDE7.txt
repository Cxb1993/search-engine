1. 前言
植生工法為近年來抵抗邊坡淺層破壞的重點發展領域，亦為邊坡生態工程之
一重要方法。過去研究多在探討植物根系提供土壤之抗剪強度增量評估方法或植
生邊坡之整體加勁效應。目前根系力學理論將植物根系提供土壤抗剪強度視為根
系發展拉應力之結果，由理論公式之計算，獲得根系提供之剪力強度貢獻。依現
有之根系力學理論（Gray & Leiser，1982），任一傾斜根系所提供土壤抗剪強度
增量(ΔS)表示為：
 /tan)90cos()90sin(   RtS (1)
式中ΔS：根系提供土壤抗剪強度增量； Rt ：單位土壤面積根之平均拉應力；值︰
根系於剪力帶厚度內因剪力變形所產生之角度。
表示為：

 (2)
式中 m：剪扭曲比，m=2B/Z（2B：剪位移量；Z：剪力帶厚度）；i：根系相對
於剪力方向之初始生長角度。部份根系初始生長角度情況下，根系在受剪過程中
有發展壓應力的情況，並對土壤剪力抗剪強度增量(ΔS)產生負面的貢獻。此根系
初 始 生 長 角 度 i 約 介 於 100至 150間 ( 依 m 值 情 況 而 定 ) ，
(sin(90-)+cos(90-)tan)項開始出現負的數值，即初始生長角度(i)介於 100
至 150之根系對式(1)之ΔS 為負的貢獻。
Jewell and Wroth(1987)進行單一塑膠加勁材料(Polymer reinforcements)於土壤
中之直接剪力試驗(Direct shear tests)，探討加勁材料勁度(Stiffness)、加勁材料
與剪位移面交角等因素對加勁土壤剪力行為之影響。由試驗結果發現：加勁材
料對土壤剪力強度之貢獻量隨加勁材料傾斜角度之不同而有相當程度之差異，
圖 1 為加勁材料於土壤中傾斜角對土壤剪力強度增量(表示為ext/yy)之影響，圖
中角為加勁材料與剪力面法線之夾角，當角約為 30時，加勁材料對土壤提
供之抗剪強度達到最大；當 角為 90時，即加勁材料長向平行於剪力方向情
況，加勁材料幾乎對土壤不提供任何抗剪強度；當 角為 0時，即加勁材料長
向垂直於剪力方向情況，加勁材料對土壤提供之抗剪強度約為 角為 30時(最
佳情況)之 70%。
植物根系於土壤中受剪後之應力發展情況直接影響其抗剪抵抗力之發揮及可
靠評估方法之建立。上述之理論是否為實際情況，至今缺乏試驗數據的求證，也
質疑植物根系之初始生長角度於土壤抗剪強度增量(ΔS)為負面影響，是否在穩定
邊坡土壤為負面效果。若能了解根系在何種條件下(根系相對於剪力面之生長位
置、根徑、長度、根系生長型態)導致發展拉或壓應力行為，將有助於了解植物
根系受剪後應力發展情況，及根系於試體各位置對土壤抗剪強度提供之角色。此
外，此研究有助於植物根系在邊坡穩定中扮演角色之探討。

別黏貼於鋼片上及下中央處，並於應變片外塗裝防水樹脂(Silicon)，可經由實驗
進行時鋼片應變量測推求根系伸長量及發展之應力。

根系面積大部分分佈於群組二，佔銀合歡整體根系約 65% ; 群組三分佈最少，
佔銀合歡整體根系約 10%。
實驗後挖掘出根系，檢視後發現群組二之斜出根有根系斷裂且通過剪力面有
足夠的長度發揮錨錠功效。由表 2 得知通過剪力面之根系數量、根系面積比與角
度之關係，可知植物銀合歡整體根系無明顯主根且近垂直根系數量稀少，佔多數
以斜出根系為主，群組二之根系面積比所佔銀合歡植物整體根系約 67%，群組三
只佔銀合歡整體根系約 14%。圖 14(a、b)顯示通過剪力面之根系面積最大達
800( 2mm )，均分佈於群組二，若通過剪力面之根系面積所佔群組二和群組三越
多，抗剪強度亦隨之提高。銀合歡之水平根系生長最發達，其次為斜出根系、最
後為近垂直根系。
由調查植物銀合歡根系生長情況，此銀合歡根系為斜出根系型態。若以根系
數量與根系面積比為前提之下，則群組一和群組二佔植物銀合歡整根根系約 85%
左右，而群組三之近垂直根佔植物銀合歡整體根系約 15%左右。

6-2-2 銀合歡根系軸向力與土體剪位移之關係
本試驗於土體 1m × 1m 內部埋設環片夾具時，利用現有工具-量角規、捲尺、
電子式游標卡尺分別記錄土體內部之根系長度、埋設環片夾具之根系根徑及植物
銀合歡各根系初始生長角度(垂直面之投影角度、水平面之投影角度)，量測方式
如圖 16(a)、(b)所示，各組環片夾具之基本資料如表 3。
試體後端之根系並非在受剪過程中全部發揮拉力(見表 4)，有發展壓力之情
況產生。L01 試體後端之後端各監測根系均發展壓力，因後端後端監測根系生長
情況皆未通過剪力面，且生長方向與剪力方向相反，導致根系在受剪過程中發生
根系壓縮或偏移之趨勢。L01 試體後端監測各根系於垂直面之投影角度範圍為
0°~20°，根系發展為水平根系與斜出根系;根系於水平面之投影角度範圍為
20°~30°，根徑範圍為 3~7 mm 之細根，導致 L01 試體後端根系發展壓力。其中
編號 A-9 根系埋設深度最接近剪力面處，該位置剪位移較大，發展之壓應力較
大。圖 17 為 L01 試體後端根系軸向力-土體剪位移關係，近水平根系之發展壓力
大小是 A-1 > A-2；根系監測深度為 A-1 > A-2 ;監測根徑為 A-2 > A-1。
此外，L02 試體之後端根系均發展為拉力，如圖 18 所示，試體之後端根系
根系垂直面之投影角度範圍為 10°~80°，根系水平面之投影角度範圍為
30°~120°。B-12 位置根系發展低程度壓力，其他監測點均發展拉力，最大值達約
1 kN。
埋設於側端各監測根系之環片夾具資料如表 5 所示，側端之根系力量均發展
為拉力(見圖 17 及 19)，根徑均大於 10mm 以上之粗根，各組環片夾具埋設深度
相對於剪力面之上、中、下處，根系拉力發展均 0.6 kN 以上，其中監測根系之
根系發展最大拉力達至 1.37 kN，隨著土體剪位移增加，根系發展拉力呈遞增之

Introduction
The mobilization and transmission of root forces within root-permeated soils
subjected to shear play an important role in the contribution of root systems to the
shear resistance of soils. The shear deformation developed within root-permeated
soil directly affects root forces in the soil. The shear resistance provided by plant
roots in soil is frequently estimated based on the simple force equilibrium theory
(Waldron, 1977; Wu et al., 1979) or on limited experimental data (Operstein and
Frydman, 2000; Docker and Hubble, 2008; Fan and Su, 2008). At present, there are
no reliable methods for estimating the stress condition mobilized in roots for soils
permeated with an entire plant root system subjected to shear. Most of the existing
methods for estimating the increase in the shear strength provided by plant roots
assume that the tensile strength of roots is fully mobilized for root-permeated soils
subjected to shear. Because the deformation patterns of the individual roots in a root
system are not necessarily consistent, this assumption may not be appropriate. Root
stresses developed in root-permeated soil may be affected by root orientation, root
length, shear deformation in the soil, and the location of the root with respect to the
shear direction.
A simple force equilibrium model for evaluating the shear strength that vertical
roots can provide in soils was developed by Waldron (1977) and Wu et al. (1979),
and a model for inclined roots was presented by Gray and Leiser (1982). This model
provides useful insight into the mechanism of soil-root interactions. Waldron and
Dakessian (1981) extended the simple soil-root model to account for root diameters
and the tensile properties of roots; the extended model predicts the increase in the
shear resistance provided by roots in stretching, slipping, and breaking modes. Abe
and Ziemer (1991) proposed a model for calculating the root stress of vertical single
roots within a soil mass subjected to shear; their model is based on simple force
equilibrium theory in association with the deformation characteristics of roots within
the soil. The development of root stresses in breakage and slippage modes were
considered in this research. However, the equation derived by Abe and Ziemer (1991)
can simply predict the shear resistance provided by vertical roots. Shewbridge and
Sitar (1990) presented a deformation-based model, which they used to investigate
the influence of soil and reinforcement properties on the work required to deform the
reinforced soil. The tension developed in the reinforcement was affected by the
22
properties. Thomas and Pollen-Bankhead (2010) further used the fiber bundle model
in association with Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the effect of root
orientation on root reinforcement. Some roots may be oriented such that they
initially undergo compressive modes before tensioning as soils are subject to
shearing.
This paper aims to develop a framework for predicting the relationship between
the increase in the shear resistance and the shear displacement of soils permeated
with a plant root system. The root orientation is taken into account in the proposed
model. The model is verified using the measured data obtained from in situ shear
tests for soils permeated with roots of Casuarina equisetifolia L. (ironwood) and
Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb. (Chinese tallow tree). Additionally, the influence of
soil-root bond strengths, b coefficients, which are used to describe the deformed
shape of the shear zone, Young’s moduli of roots, and short roots on the performance
of the model developed is investigated and discussed.
Materials and methods
Development of the relationship between increased shear resistance and shear
displacement for root-permeated soils
Gray and Leiser (1982) derived a force equilibrium equation for inclined roots in
soil subjected to shear, as shown in Fig. 1. The shear strength provided by roots
within the soil is expressed as
     tan90cos90sin  ooRtS (1)
where S is the shear strength provided by roots, is the angle of shear distortion
expressed as tan-1[1/(m+(tan i)-1)] (where i is the initial angle of root inclination with
respect to the shear surface and m is the shear distortion ratio (m=x/z)), x is the shear
displacement, and z is the width of the shear zone. This force equilibrium model
assumes that the width of the shear zone remains constant during shear. The
mobilized tensile force in roots per unit area of the soil, tR, is expressed as
R
R R
A
t = T
A
(2)
where TR is the tensile stress developed in roots, A is the area of the soil shear
surface, and AR is the total cross-sectional area of all roots crossing the shear surface.
The root area ratio is defined as AR/A.
Abe and Ziemer (1991) developed a model to predict the shear resistance
24
whereSt is the shear resistance contributed by each root in a root system in a given
shear deformation, Se is the shear resistance contributed by roots undergoing
stretching, Ss is the shear resistance contributed by roots undergoing slippage, and
Sb is the shear resistance contributed by roots undergoing breakage. Additionally,
Abe and Ziemer (1991) indicated that soil reinforcement was also contributed by the
shear deformation acting on the root itself. Thus, the total shear resistance
contributed by the root system can be expressed as
t pΔS ΔS ΔS+= (4)
whereS is the total shear resistance contributed by the plant root system, andSp is
the shear resistance contributed by the shear deformation acting on the root. The
shear resistance contributed by each root in the root system at a given shear
displacement (or shear deformation in the root) can be estimated if root stresses are
appropriately estimated. Derivations of the root stress at different deformation
conditions (i.e., stretching, slippage and breakage) and the calculation of the increase
in the shear resistance (S) are described in the following sections.
(A) Derivations of the root stress
(I) Stretching mode
(1) Long roots
Long roots are defined as roots with a length exceeding the shear plane in the soil
mass. Roots are considered as elastic materials, and roots deform in compatibility
with the surrounding soil. Roots develop shear deformations as the soil mass is
subject to shear deformations and tensile stresses are mobilized in the root. The
tensile stress developed in the root can be expressed as
RT Eε= (5)
where TR is the tensile stress developed in the root, E is the Young’s modulus of the 
root, andis the mobilized strain in the root. To estimate the strain developed in the
root, the length of the root after deformation must be calculated. This length can be
expressed as (Abe and Ziemer, 1991)
2 2 2dL = dx + dy (6)
where L is the length of deformed root, dx is an infinitely short interval in the x-axis,
which is perpendicular to the shear direction, and dy is an infinitely short interval in
the y-axis, which is the shear direction. Shewbridge and Sitar (1989) developed an
exponential equation to describe the deformed shape of fiber-reinforced soils after

(2) Short roots
A plant root system consists of roots of different lengths. Roots of lengths
insufficient to penetrate the shear plane can be regarded as short roots. Fan and
Su (2008) indicated that short roots may function as fiber reinforcements in the
soil mass and may mobilize noticeable tensile stresses as the soil mass
undergoes large shear deformations. Thus, short roots may also contribute
shear resistance to the soil. The deformation pattern of short roots in soil
subjected to shear was investigated using in situ shear tests in research
conducted by Fan and Su (2009). Thin plastic strips with sufficient (long) and
short lengths were installed vertically within soil specimens permeated with
plant roots before shearing. The deformation of the plastic strips following the
shear test was mapped after excavating the specimen to represent the
development of the deformation of the shear zone. The deformation of the long
and short plastic strips in this experiment is shown in Fig. 3. The deformation
patterns of long and short roots in the soil above the shear plane are nearly
identical. The maximum strain as well as the tensile stress in short roots can be
assumed to be located at the middle point of the shear zone above the shear
plane, i.e., x=0.25z where z is the width of the shear zone. The tensile stress
developed in short roots can be computed using eq. (12) in association with
x=0.25z.
(II) Slippage mode
Roots may slip through the soil if the tensile stress in the root is greater than
its bonding strength. Waldron (1977) proposed that the maximum tension in the
root at incipient slippage can be expressed as
s
2 L
T =
D

(14)
where Ts is the maximum tension in the root at incipient slippage, is the
maximum tangential shear stress mobilized at the soil-root interface (soil-root
bond strength), L is the root length, and D is the root diameter. Additionally,
Waldron and Dakessian (1981) indicated that the minimum root length (Lm)
required to fully mobilize the tensile stress of the root and prevent pullout or
slippage is
ult
m
T D
L =
2
(15)
where Tult is the ultimate tensile strength of the root. Thus, as shown in eq. (14),
roots in the soil at a given shear displacement (2B) may undergo slippage if the
28
where n is the number of roots in the root system, m is the root number, Tm is
the root stress of root m, ARm is the cross-sectional area of root m, and A is the
area of the soil shear surface. The tensile stress (Tm) developed in each root in a
root system depends on the deformation modes of the root, i.e., stretching,
slippage or breakage and can be estimated based on eqs. (13) and (14) and on
the criteria (eqs. (16) and (18)) presented in this study.
Abe and Ziemer (1991) indicated that roots undergoing shear deformation
in stretching mode may also provide reinforcement to the soil. The shear
resistance of the root itself can be expressed as
3
p 3
d y
V = EI( )
dx
(20)
where Vp is the shear resistance contributed by the root that is undergoing shear
deformation. By substituting eq. (7) into eq. (20), Vp can be given as
3 -bx
pV = EIb Be (21)
where I is the moment of inertia of the root section and E is the Young’s 
modulus of the root. For roots with length greater than the shear plane (long
roots), the maximum shear resistance of the root occurs at x=0, whereas for
roots with length less than the shear plane (short roots), the maximum shear
resistance of the root occurs at x=0.25z. Thus, the maximum shear resistance
per unit area of the soil (A) contributed by the shear deformation of long and
short roots can be expressed as eqs. (22) and (23), respectively.
3
pΔS = EIb B/A (22)
3 -0.25bz
pΔS = EIb Be /A (23)
At any given shear displacement (2B) in the soil, the increase in shear
resistance provided by a single root system can be estimated using the method
described above. The relationship between the increase in shear resistance and
shear displacement for soils permeated with a plant root system can then be
established using formulated spreadsheets.
In situ shear tests

shovel and hands until the root structure was completely exposed. The diameter,
length, and orientation of each root in the root system were measured. Root
orientation was measured by projecting the root structure on a vertical
whiteboard with pre-drawn lines and associated orientation readings, as shown in
Fig. 4. Root orientations () were measured in terms of the departure angle
opposite to the shear direction, as shown in Fig. 5. The root orientation values
ranged from 0to 180. Root diameters were measured using digital calipers
with a resolution of 0.01 mm. To record the entire root architecture, the roots
crossing the shear plane were specifically marked in the measurement of the root
structure. The root system of ironwood shows well-grown near-vertical roots and
lateral roots, and its root hairs are dense. Near-vertical roots are dominant in the
root system of the Chinese tallow tree, and lateral roots are sparse. In situ shear
tests of four root systems, including two samples of ironwood and two samples
of Chinese tallow tree, were selected for verification of the proposed model. The
root area ratios for both the selected ironwood samples are 0.042. The root area
ratios for the selected Chinese tallow trees are 0.076 and 0.03. Further details
regarding the quantitative measurement of roots in a root structure can be found
in Fan and Chen (2010).
Tensile properties of plant roots
The ultimate tensile strength of roots with various diameters for the plant
species used in this study was measured using a computer-controlled tensile
tester (Shimadzu Inc., Model Ag-10tg). Roots of approximately uniform
diameter and with length greater than 0.2 m were selected and used in the tensile
tests. The root diameters used in the tensile tests ranged from 0.5 mm to
approximately 7−8 mm. The root length between the top and bottom grips of the
tensile tester was 0.1 m. The rate of extension was 0.02 m/min. The root
diameter near the location of rupture was measured using a digital caliper and the
value was used to compute the ultimate tensile strength. The relationship
between the ultimate tensile strength and the root diameter for ironwood and
Chinese tallow tree is given in eqs. (24) and (25) (Fan and Chen, 2010).

of the increase in shear resistance with respect to shear displacement very well.
Nevertheless, the success of the shear displacement-based model relies on
appropriate estimation of the b coefficient, the width of the shear zone, and the
soil-root bond strength. To enhance the reliability of the shear
displacement-based model, more experimental studies on the width of the shear
zone and the coefficient b, which governs the deformation pattern of
root-permeated soils, are needed.
Discussion
Effect of the b coefficient on the relationship between the increase in shear
resistance and shear displacement
The b coefficient governs the distortion and the width of the shear zone, as
shown by eq. (7). Shewbridge and Sitar (1990) indicated that the b coefficient
decreases with increasing reinforcement concentration (root area ratio), soil-root
bond strength and stiffness of the root. In field experimental studies, Fan and Su
(2009) showed that the b coefficient decreases with increasing soil moisture
content. Soil properties and root structure can also affect the b coefficient.
However, experimental data on the b coefficient for plant root systems are
limited. To understand the effect of the b coefficient on the relationship between
the increase in shear resistance and shear displacement, parametric studies were
conducted on soils permeated with the root systems of ironwood and Chinese
tallow tree. The results, which are presented in Fig. 9, show that the S value
increases with the b coefficient. For soils permeated with the root system of
ironwood and subjected to a shear displacement of 0.005 m (a small shear
displacement), theS value increases by about 23% if the b coefficient increases
by 10%, and the S value drops by about 20% if the b coefficient decreases by
10%. In addition, at a shear displacement of 0.05 m (considered a large shear
displacement in the shear resistance vs. shear displacement relationship for
root-permeated soils), the S value increases by about 11% if the b coefficient
increases by 10%, and the S value drops by about 10% if the b coefficient
decreases by 10%. The influence of the b coefficient on the S vs. shear
displacement relationships for soils permeated with the root system of Chinese
tallow tree is similar to that for ironwood, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Summaries of
the influence of the b coefficient on the S value for soils permeated with the
root system of ironwood and Chinese tallow tree are given in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively. The experimental data indicate that the b coefficient considerably
affects the increase in the shear resistance at the early stage of shearing (low
34
in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Available data on the soil-root bond strength () for various plant species
associated with different soil types are limited. Based on measuring the pullout
resistance of single roots, Stolzy and Barley (1968) estimated that thevalue for
roots of field pea (Pisum sativum) was about 10 kPa (100 g/cm2) in the absence
of root hairs; values ranged from 30−60 kPa for roots with root hairs extending 
into the dense unsaturated soil. Waldron (1977) reported that the value for
alfalfa roots penetrating a coarse gravel-sand mixture exceeded 41.7 kPa (417
g/cm2). Further research on soil-root bond strength is necessary to further
enhance the application of the shear displacement-based model.
Efect of the Young’s modulus of roots on the relationship between the increase 
in shear resistance and shear displacement
The Young’s modulus (E) of the root affects the tensile stress developed in
the root as roots in the soil are subject to deformations. The Young’s modulus of 
the root depends on the root diameter (Waldron and Dakessian, 1981) as well as
on the plant species. Fig. 11 shows the influence of the E value of the root on the
predicted relationship between the increase in shear resistance (S) and the shear
displacement for soils permeated with the root systems of ironwood and Chinese
tallow tree. Three sets of E values were used in this study: E values (Eroot) based
on the regression curve shown in Fig. 6a, E values equal to 50% of Eroot for roots
with different diameters, and E values that are 1.5 times the Eroot for roots with
different diameters. At a given shear displacement, the S value increases with
the E value of the root. For soils permeated with the root system of ironwood and
subjected to small shear displacements (0.005 m), the S value increases by
approximately 47% as the E values of the roots increase by 50%, and the S
value drops by approximately 47% as the E values of the roots decrease by 50%.
At large shear displacements (0.05 m), the S value increases by approximately
18% as the E values of the roots increase by 50%, and the S value drops by
approximately 17% as the E values of the roots decrease by 50%. Similar results
on the influence of the E value of the root on the relationship of S and shear
displacement were obtained for soils permeated with the root system of Chinese
tallow tree. Summaries of the influence of the E value on the S value for soils
permeated with the root systems of ironwood and Chinese tallow tree are given
in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
The E values of the roots have a considerable influence on the estimate of the
increase in the shear resistance provided by a plant root system at the early stage
36
systems of ironwood and Chinese tallow tree are given in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively.
Waldron and Dakessian (1981) indicated that long roots are more resistant to
slippage than short roots and that shear resistance increases with root length.
These authors showed that root length has no effect on shear resistance at small
shear displacements, while an effect was noticeable at large shear displacements.
Additionally, Stokes et al. (2009) indicated that lateral roots provide protection
against most shallow landslides. The research conducted herein demonstrates
that ignoring the presence of short or lateral roots may lead to considerable
underestimation of the increase in shear resistance (S), especially at large shear
displacements. The soil mass above the shear plane does not undergo rigid body
motion as root-permeated soils undergo shear deformations. Thus, almost all the
roots contribute to the shear resistance of the soil. Nevertheless, the pattern of
distribution of short roots in the root systems of various plant species is the key
factor governing the contribution of short roots to the shear resistance of the soil.
Stokes et al. (2009) reported that plant root system form varies not only between
species but also within a species. Thus, the degree of influence of short roots on
the predicted S value depends on the characteristics of the plant root system
and the root architecture of the plant species.
Conclusions
A displacement-based model for predicting the relationship between the
increase in shear resistance and shear displacement for soil permeated with an
entire plant root system is presented in this paper. The proposed model is verified
using the results obtained from in situ shear tests on soils permeated with the
root systems of ironwood and Chinese tallow tree. The model can precisely
capture the relationship between the increase in shear resistance and shear
displacement. The following additional major conclusions can be drawn from
this research. (1) The increase in the shear resistance (S) increases considerably
with increasing b coefficient at the early stage of shearing; however, the
influence of the b coefficient on the S value decreases with increasing shear
displacement. (2) The soil-root bond strength () has a slight influence on theS
value at small shear displacements, whereas the S value increases significantly
with increasing values at large shear deformations. (3) The increase in shear
resistance provided by a plant root system increases considerably with the
Young’s moduli (E) of the roots at early stages of shearing, whereas the influence 
of the E values of the roots on the increase in the ultimate shear resistance is
