Abstract 
First year 
In the first research year, we have attempted to construct a class of mathematical models for the 
regulation of gene networks for biological systems. Mathematical model describing these processes might be 
of great help to gain qualitative and, most importantly, quantitative analysis and design about such complex 
systems. However, since biochemical regulatory networks including genes, proteins and other regulatory 
molecules are usually characterized by their high complexity, to further simplify the structure of the biology 
system model, a model reduction technique has been developed to reduce size of the complete signal 
transduction network while capturing the specific characteristics of the original system. 
 
Second year 
In the second research year, we design a robust estimator based on the extended Kalman filtering theory. 
Development of the robust stabilizing strategy for noisy gene networks for stability assurance and noise 
rejection have also been investigated. According to the concepts of estimator design, an improved estimator 
has been developed to reconstruct the internal states of gene networks and analyze stability of the system for 
the noisy biological system with noisy uncertainties. 
 
Third year 
In the third research year, we apply the real structural genetic algorithm to simultaneously search for the 
optimal model parameters and the simplest system structure and synthesize biological oscillatory signal with 
the desired period, amplitude and phase. For the gene network with intrinsic and extrinsic noises, we also 
design a robust synthetic genetic oscillator with the optimal model parameters and the simplest system 
structure. We also synthesize the basic logic gate to compose the more complex sequence logic circuits.

First Year: 
1. Model Reduction of Biochemical Networks 
Abstract—Biochemical networks are not only complex but also 
extremely large. The construction and analysis for the 
mathematical model is thus relatively difficult. In practice, it is 
usually desirable to further simplify the structure of biological 
system models for the sake of reducing computation burden or 
simplification of the task of analysis. By introducing the technique 
of singular value decomposition it is possible to identify the major 
flux rate and hence deduce the corresponding signal transduction 
path. In this part, a model reduction technique deduced from 
control theory is proposed to reduce that kind of systems. 
 
Keywords-model reduction; biochemical systems; linear system 
theory 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, regulative machines of the gene networks on 
biological systems have been discussed from the viewpoint of 
control theory. The biological systems and the genetic 
regulative networks are usually extremely complicated. Direct 
analysis of that kind of systems based on the mathematical 
models is usually hard to conduct from the viewpoint of 
computational efficiency. To remedy the difficulty, one 
appropriate approach is to simplify the model before actually 
conducting the analysis, i.e. configuration of biological systems 
is simplified to reduce its actual size. In the mathematics, the 
stoichiometric matrix is commonly applied to express the 
framework of biochemical networks [1, 2], which is built from 
the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions that contains a 
reaction network. 
The technique of singular value decomposition (SVD) has 
been used in the field of engineering for model simplification 
and data compression. For biochemical territory, the 
stoichiometric matrix can be disassembled into eigen-reaction 
(which is corresponding to the left singular vector), singular 
value and eigen-connectivity (which is corresponding to the 
right singular vector) [3, 4]. SVD provided a useful 
mathematical framework for processing and modeling genome-
wide expression data, in which both of the mathematical 
variables and operations may be assigned to certain biological 
meanings [5]. It is thus quite nature to expect that the 
characteristics and information of the state variables can be 
peeked from the decomposed network structure. 
In data analysis, one often uses a numerical criterion to 
terminate the cumulative spectrum and define the number of 
modes that generate 95% of the reconstruction of the matrix [6]. 
Determine the effective dimensionality representing 95% of the 
variance of the matrix being decomposed. In [7], the authors 
have shown that the upper bound of the tolerated parameter 
variations is related to the system matrix of the biochemical 
network at the steady state. The tolerance of the parameter 
uncertainty was estimated under which the system stability is 
preserved. 
In this paper, we propose a model reduction method to 
simplify the complex rational rate expressions of biochemical 
networks such as enzymatic reactions. It is easy to apply and 
allows for user-specified reductions of individual rate 
expressions in the complete models. Results of simulation study 
are presented to demonstrate the approach proposed. It is hoped 
that this method presents an alternative to achieve the classical 
engineering objective of improved parameter identifiability 
without losing the systems biology demand of preserved 
biochemical interpretation [8]. 
II. METHODS 
Mathematical models describing the biochemical reaction 
processes might be of great help to gain qualitative and 
quantitative knowledge about such kind of complex systems. A 
method is applied below that can be utilized to reduce the size 
of biochemical networks while retaining their major dynamic 
characteristics. The biochemical network is first expressed in 
terms of the ordinary differential equations with the 
stoichiometric matrix. SVD based model reduction is then 
applied to simplify the model. The dynamic behavior and error 
responses are analyzed and discussed. 
A. Fundamental Principle of  the Stoichiometric Matrix 
The stoichiometric matrix is a regular pattern in which each 
row serves as a compound and every column as a reaction. It is 
a connectivity matrix that represents a network. Elements of the 
matrix are stoichiometric coefficients, which are integers. Every 
column describing a reaction is constrained by the rules of 
chemistry, such as mass balances. Each row describes the 
reactions in which the compound participates and how make the 
reactions are interconnected. The stoichiometric matrix 
transforms the flux vector (reaction rate) into a vector. It 
contains the time derivatives of the concentrations. Thus the 
stoichiometric matrix precisely comprises chemical and 
network information. 
According to [1], there are four fundamental subspaces of the 
stoichiometric matrix including necessary information about a 
reaction network. That is, its null space contains all the steady-
state flux distributions allowable and the row space contains all 
the dynamic flux distributions. Its left null space involves all the 
conservation relationships that a network contains and column 
space contains all the possible time derivatives of the 
concentration vector.

The elements of U are stoichiometric coefficients and the 
elements of V  are reaction participation numbers in modal by 
(7) and (9). 
Several factors charactering a biochemical model are 
summarized in the follows. Knowing their stuctures and related 
propertis would be useful in constructing a simplified ones that 
capture dominat characteristics of the original models. One may 
refere to [1] for description of extra details. 
A. Extreme Pathways 
Biochemical steady-state flux rate solutions can be 
represented by a nonnegative linear combination of convex 
basis vectors [1] as 
 s i if n  (10) 
where the vectors in  are a unique convex generating set, but i  
may not be unique for a given sf . 
B. Pathway Matrix 
The pathway matrix reflects several useful properties of a 
biochemical network. The stoichiometric matrix can decompose 
the pathway matrix into three parts as follows 
 1 2 3[ ,  ,  , ,  ]  iR n n n n  (11) 
or 
   TR P Q  (12) 
where   consists only singular values and zero elements, the 
columns of P  are eigen-pathways and the row of TQ  are eigen-
participations using an analogy enzymatic reaction matrix. The 
eigen-participations represent how the extreme pathways can be 
linearly combined to form the scaled modes of P : 
  RQ P  (13) 
It is clear that the elements of Q  are the weightings on the 
pathways needed to reconstruct each of the modes of P  as 
scaled by their respective singular values. 
The following factors characterize a meaningful pathway 
matrix [1]. 
1) Input and output relationships: The exchange reactions 
determine which output can be achieved from a given input. On 
the other hand, one can determine all the input combinations 
leading to a given output. One can also determine which 
pathways have an identical set of inputs and outputs which 
represent pathway redundancy. Based on the input and output 
relationships, one can define crosstalk using the overlap 
between the inputs and outputs in a set of pathways. 
2) Pathway length: A pathway can be thought as a linear 
sequence of events and the length of the pathway is the number 
of steps in this sequence. The length represents the number of 
reactions that participate in the pathway.  
3) Decompose a flux state into extreme pathways: Convex 
basis vectors can be used to reconstruct any point in a convex 
space. However, the reconstruction is not unique. Thus, 
knowing all the ways in which a particular point in the space 
can be decomposed into constituent pathways is necessary. 
4) Number of reaction participation: The number of 
pathways indicates how many pathways are affected when a 
reaction is removed from the network. The knockout of a gene 
can lead to the removal of a reaction or some reactions, or a 
reaction can be down-regulated. One can compute correlated 
subsets of reactions that always appear together in the extreme 
pathways.  
5) Consequences of regulatory rules: The reconstruction of 
regulatory networks can lead to a set of causal relationships that 
describe regulatory interactions. These logical statements can be 
such that an extreme pathway can never be expressed due to 
conflicts with the regulatory rules, or only expressed under 
certain environmental conditions. From which one can assess 
how regulation reduces the allowable functional states. 
V. REDUCE MODEL OF BIOCHEMICAL NETWORK 
The techniques include lumping, sensitivity analysis, and 
target factor analysis. Large reaction networks difficulties in 
simulation and control when computation time is restricted. In 
the given literature, a few reduced models have been developed 
[9]. 
A meaningful approach to analyze large mathematical 
models is to decompose them into smaller modules, as these 
modules are much more manageable and easier to analyze than 
the original one. To reduce a model with a reasonable size, the 
resulting linear modules, while replaced by less complex 
models, should show approximately the same input and output 
behaviors. 
A. Essential reaction analysis

biochemical network, the matrix TS S  is diagonalized by 
applying its eigenvalues and eigenvectors [4],

VI. CONCLUSION 
The part has proposed a SVD approach for identifying the 
dominant characteristics of the biochemical networks and 
reducing the full order model accordingly. The primary 
information of the system is quickly obtained on the basis of the 
simplified model. Some demonstrative examples have been 
tested and verified to be applicable. Extensive investigation is 
currently undergoing to resolve related problems.

III. ESTIMATION BASED ON EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER 
Biochemical process for gene regulatory networks is DNA 
to mRNA by transcription, mRNA to protein by translation and 
the generated protein regulates the gene. Because the protein 
concentration is not individually measurable [15], however, one 
can access the estimation values for individual protein by the 
method based on the EKF.  
The objective here is to design an EKF of the following 
form [13]:

The results of dynamic simulation of the noise-free and 
estimated states for the noisy gene regulatory network are 
shown as in Fig. 2. As it can be seen that the estimator tracked 
well the noise-free state values while there were intrinsic noise, 
extrinsic noise and measurement noise. The response of Kalman 
gain K  is illustrated in Fig. 3. This estimation scheme work 
satisfactorily for a class of noisy gene regulatory networks when 
the protein concentration is not individually measureable or 
partly unmeasured. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This part proposes a design method based on EKF to 
estimate state variables for a class of noisy gene regulatory 
networks. The filter is developed to estimate the state variables 
of the noisy gene regulatory networks while the protein 
concentration is not individually measurable. Quantitative error 
analysis for state estimation is presented. A design example for 
a demonstrative network is provided for verification of the 
proposed approach.

modeling accuracy, the influence resulting from noise 
contamination should not be ignored. In general, molecular 
noises involve intrinsic noises resulting from molecular birth 
and death and extrinsic noises due to environmental influences 
such as changes in temperature, PH or levels of nutrients [2, 3]. 
Noises may affect the quantitative and qualitative of 
biological systems. At present, the biological experiments show 
that one can regulate the binding sites to control the expression 
of gene networks [4]. Nonlinear feedback control methods were 
also applied to regulate the steady state of biological systems in 
[5, 6]. Other issues received increasing attention for noisy 
biological systems are development of control strategies while 
ensuring robust stability and filtering ability. In [7], a robust 
filtering circuit design has been developed by regulating kinetic 
parameters. 
Before performing the feedback control methods mentioned 
above, the biological state information should all be available. 
However, mostly, the internal states of that kind of systems can 
only be observed partially. Under the situation, a state estimator 
is appropriate to reconstruct the full states especially in the 
noisy environment. The Kalman filter (KF) [8] is one for the 
purpose in the filed of engineering for decades. However, 
applications of the extended KF (EKF) in state estimation of 
nonlinear biochemical networks are rarely found [9]. Until 
recently, it was attempted to estimate parameters of nonlinear 
dynamic gene regulatory networks [10]. Moreover, a state 
estimator was actually implemented based on the fluorescence 
probe model, a dynamic state model of the plant cell bioreactor, 
and online GFP fluorescence measurement [11]. 
While there were a few papers dealing with the issue of state 
estimation for biological networks, most approaches were based 
on the traditional Kalman filtering theory which assumed that 
the noise covariances including the process noise and 
measurement noise have been known as a priori [11]. The KF 
has been shown to present the optimal state estimation against 
noise with Gaussian distributions. However, in that kind of 
systems, the noise distribution may not be Gaussian, its 
autocorrelations may not be known exactly, or even uneasily to 
be precisely modeled [2, 3]. In [12], a robust EKF has recently 
been proposed to deal with the issue of state and parameter 
estimation for a class of gene network systems with noises. This 
paper develops robust estimator design to a general class of 
perturbed gene networks with uncertain multiple intrinsic noise 
sources. Quantitative error analysis for that kind of systems is 
presented based on the Ito derivates and Lyapunov stability 
theory. In silico experiments have been conducted to verify the 
theoretical results obtained.

A. Problem Description 
For description of the problem, consider first a noisy 
nonlinear synthetic gene network of a cascade loop of 
transcriptional inhibitions built in E. coli with four genes 
( ,  ,  tetR lacI cI  and eyfp ), three repressor proteins (TetR, LacI, 
CI), the fluorescent protein EYFP as the output, and aTc 
(anhydrotetracycline) as the input to the system. The 
fluorescence of the system resulting from EYFP is the only 
measured output and other gene products ,  ,  tetR lacI cI  are not 
accessible. By considering the disturbance effect the dynamic 
response of the system can be described by the following 
equation and illustrated as in Fig. 1 [4]:

III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
In this section, two performance analyses are derived. One 
is to quantify the upper bound of estimation error and other one 
is to analyze the stability condition of the noisy gene network. 
A. Condition governing convergence of the estimation error

estimation error and state response by applying the Bellman-
Gronwall inequality.

Reasonably suppose for the biological systems that the 
linearized matrix F  is Hurwitz, and by nominal estimator 
design, F KH  should be a stable matrix with desired 
eigenvalues which specify the desired convergent speed of the 
estimation error. Hence, there exist positive constants m , 1m

V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents a robust estimator to estimate internal 
states of a class of gene networks which are simultaneously 
corrupted by extrinsic and intrinsic noises with uncertain noise 
covariances. Quantitative analyses for performance of state 
estimation have been presented. In silico experiments confirm 
the proposed method for designing the robust estimator. The 
results show potential of the presented approach in bridging the 
engineering approach to solve for the problem of concentration 
estimation in biological systems.

biological oscillator based on RSGA. This is a multi-objective 
optimization problem for simultaneously search the optimal 
parameters and structure such that the cost is minimal.

5. Design of Robust Synthetic Genetic Oscillators 
Based on RSGA 
Abstract: Synthetic biology is highly valued in the recent decade. 
In a previous study, Elowitz and Leibler (Nature, vol. 403, pp. 
335-338, 2000) have constructed a biological oscillator in 
consisting of three genes, and found out its mathematical 
expressions. Designing the optimal transcription rates of mRNA 
and the decay rates of protein concentration to track desired 
sinusoidal signal and achieve the best oscillation have been 
becoming a challenge problem since then. Actually, design of an 
oscillator can be regarded as a tracking design problem from the 
control engineer’s viewpoint. Genetic algorithm (GA) bears the 
feature of searching the global optimum for the optimization 
problem. However, subject to the fixed solution structure, the 
results may not be the cheap ones. In this paper, we introduce the 
real structure genetic algorithm (RSGA) to solve the design 
problem of synthetic biological oscillators. The design approach is 
shown to be capable of yielding genetic oscillators with a cheaper 
structure. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary application in 
molecular biology and engineering. Inspired by electronic 
logical elements, several recent studies have stated the 
possibility of realizing a genetic circuit, which is foreseen to 
have significant contribution to cancer medicine as well as to a 
variety of bio-energy sources (Hasty et al. 2002; Dasika and 
Maranas, 2008). Elowitz and Leibler (2000) have proposed a 
genetic ring oscillator known as repressilator consisting of three 
genes: tetR, lacI, λcI. The three genes repress each other like a 
ring oscillation circuit comprising three NOT logic gates and 
induces green fluorescent protein oscillation. That 
transcriptional regulation oscillation behavior can be modelled 
based on several factors, including mRNA, the dependence of 
transcription rates on repressor concentration, and the decay 
rates of the protein and the translation rates of mRNA. 
Design of a genetic oscillator with desired amplitude, phase, 
and frequency was previously thought to be a tracking design 
problem. However, the stochastic intrinsic dynamic noises and 
extrinsic disturbances can perturb the oscillatory behaviors, and 
preservation of robustness to these noises became an important 
topic (Dasika and Maranas, 2008). In (Chen and Chen, 2010), 
genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed to achieve a robust design 
to the oscillatory behaviors. GA imitates the evolutionary 
processes appearing in nature, e.g. selection, reproduction, 
crossover, and mutation. The existing GA-based design 
searches for an optimal pair of parameters including decay rates 
of protein concentrations and the transcription rates of mRNA. 
However, directly applying that approach usually leads to 
premature convergence of the solution and brings solutions with 
the cheapest structure. 
In the present study, we propose a real structured genetic 
algorithm (RSGA) to waive weaknesses of the traditional GAs, 
i.e. premature convergence of parameters and lack a mechanism 
for optimizing the solution structure (Tsai et al. 2009; Tsai et al. 
2011). We combine the advantages of RGA and SGA to 
21 
 
 
Fig. 1. N-gene oscillator 
3. REAL STRUCTURE GENETIC ALGORITHM 
Real structure genetic algorithm (RSGA) is a variant of GAs 
and SGAs. The genetic operations of RSGA include 
reproduction, crossover, and mutation. However, the control 
genes and parameter genes are both real numbers, which 
improves mathematical mechanism due to the consistent 
operators of crossover and mutation and consumes less time in 
computing ( Tsai et al. 2011). 
RSGA is an inversely design procedure to search for 
parameters. However, there is a structured genetic mapping in 
RSGA that it could make parameters operate in three functions. 
The structured mapping would generate different orders in 
genetic oscillator to search out the optimal order. Then, it 
improves the fitness value by crossover and mutation 
unceasingly. Based on this feature, RSGA achieves the optimal 
structure and parameters simultaneously for synthetic 
biological oscillators.

where [0, 1]   is the weighting factor,
pJ  is the normalized 
performance index, and sJ  is the normalized structure index. 
Our design objective is to search for the optimal decay rates of

objection function, totJ  is minimized. Furthermore, we would

where iA , iw , and if  are amplitude, frequency, and phase,

3.2 Structured genetic mapping 
The chromosomes consist of the control genes’ strings and 
the parameter genes’ strings. The control genes c and parameter 
genes p are both real numbers within min max( , )R R . However, the 
parameter genes are regulated by the control genes. RSGA 
structured mapping have three gene operations: activate, 
deactivate, and linear ratio variation. The operating function of 
control genes is determined by the correlation between the 
control genes, maxB  and minB . When the value of control gene is 
greater than maxB , the corresponding parameter gene is 
activated (ON). On the other hand, if its value is less than minB , 
the corresponding parameter gene is deactivated (OFF). When 
the value is within min max( , )B B , the parameter gene is regulated 
by a linear scaling. The structured genetic mapping from c to p 
is defined as 
23 
 
of totJ , the RSGA  yielded an oscillator with only two genes 
and the corresponding totJ  is 0.508. The related responses are 
illustrated in Fig. 4. Convergence of the fitness value is 
displayed in Fig. 5. The result demonstrates superiority of the 
proposed approach.  
The robust design of genetic oscillator to tolerate intrinsic 
and extrinsic noises is more meaningful in vivo. To bring 
uncertain fluctuations into the module, we consider (105) and 
show the performance in Fig. 6. As seen, the amplitude and 
phase would be interfered by the intrinsic parameter 
fluctuations and extrinsic disturbances. In addition, the 
evolution process of the fitness exhibits an unsteady behaviour 
(see Fig. 7). With 
1 2 31 2 3
[ , , , , , ]=[1.45 0.466 0 0 p p p     
1.435 0.464 1.392 0.504 0 0]  the corresponding pJ  is 0.5212. 
This shows that existence of the intrinsic and extrinsic noises 
would deteriorate the accuracy of oscillation.  
To improve the deficiency, we propose three methods. Firstly, 
instead of searching for the parameter ia  and ip  in (1), two 
extra parameters 
im
  and b are involved in the parameter 
searching. It can be applied to extend the parameter searching 
space from two parameters to four parameters. As shown in Fig. 
8, searching four parameters, 
im
 , ia  , ib , and ip  improves 
the tracking performance. Secondly, adjusting the hill 
coefficient can bring changes in protein concentration output. It 
was observed from the experimental results that the amplitude 
and frequency of oscillation increase as the hill coefficient 
increases. In contrast, a smaller hill coefficient results in 
smaller amplitude and frequency. As a result, if the hill 
coefficient is small enough, then the protein concentration will 
converge to a steady level. Alternately, searching for the 
random initial values can improve the transition response. The 
three methods not only extend the design freedom but also 
simplify the structure of the oscillator module. With

he corresponding totJ  is 0.1928. The method of four parameter 
searching improves the accuracy, but it losses the optimal 
structure. In other words, the order of the optimal oscillator is 
increased to three.

model, we can design variety of logic gates by selecting the 
strengths and related sites of the relative DNA binding in the 
gene’s cis-regulatory region [17]. To realize different 
transcription control characteristics in the same cis-regulatory 
construct, adjusting different parameters in the general forms 
have been discussed [14, 15]. In this thesis, we summarize 
biologic logic phenomenon of CRIF and transcription control 
general forms in a novel mathematical general model that can 
design various genetic logic gates in silico.  
Design of a biological logic gate in CRIF becomes an 
option that optimizes the model and its parameters. Optimal 
algorithms such as neural network and evolution algorithm were 
proposed for searching the fittest transcription logic 
phenomenon [12]-[15]. However, they generate irregular 
structure of model and lack the function of model simplifying. 
Therefore, they are difficult for designing more complex 
biological logic circuits. To remedy this issue, we propose the 
real structured genetic algorithm (RSGA) for transcription gate 
designing. RSGA not only searches optimal parameters 
including independent binding strengths of RNA polymerase, 
RNAp concentration, and cooperativity, but also enables the 
CRIF model variation and simplification of the CRIF model by 
extra exponential parameters. 
Through synchronized cascades of designed transcription 
gates, biological Boolean circuits can be realized. One can 
realize more complicated systems, such as bio-combinational 
logic circuits, sequential logic circuits, and [16] some 
representative designs of biological logic devices and circuits 
that spring from electric logic circuits. On the bases of these 
designs, it is expected that a biological computer might be 
implementable in the future. 
In conclusion, this study attempts to develop a more 
efficient method for solving the structure and parameter 
optimization problems in biological logic gates. Numerical 
experiments show that RSGA approach is effective in 
obtaining genetic oscillators and also some bio-logic gates with 
the cheapest structures. Moreover, we have extended our 
approach to bio-circuits that become a significant foundation 
for bio-computer design. The results presented in this thesis 
show the promising possibility for future development in 
biological engineering. 
2. Real Structured Genetic Algorithm (RSGA) 
Combining real genetic algorithm (RGA) with structured 
genetic algorithm (SGA), the Real structure genetic algorithm 
(RSGA) is a method of optimal parameters and structure 
searching. The genetic operations of RSGA include 
reproduction, crossover, and mutation which were pioneered 
by Tsai, Huang and Lin in [7, 8]. The major differences 
between RSGA and SGA is that the control genes and 
parameter genes in the former are both real numbers, which 
improves mathematical mechanism due to the consistent 
operators of crossover and mutation and consumes less time in 
computing.  
The RSGA approach is an inverse design procedure to 
search for parameters. However, there is a structured genetic 
mapping in RSGA that could make parameters operate in three 
functions. The structured mapping generates different 
structures in the biological systems to search out the optimal 
solution structure. During evolution of offsprings, it improves 
the fitness value by crossover and mutation unceasingly. Based 
on this feature, RSGA achieves the optimal structure and 
parameters simultaneously for application in design of 
synthetic biological devices. Operation of RSGA [7, 8] is 
introduced in the follows.  
2.1. Structured Genetic Mapping 
The chromosomes consist of the control genes’ strings and 
the parameter genes’ strings. The control genes c and parameter 
genes p are both real numbers within min max( , )R R . However, the 
parameter genes are regulated by the control genes. RSGA 
structured mapping have three gene operations: activate, 
deactivate, and linear ratio variation. The operating function of 
control genes is determined by the correlation between the 
control genes, maxB  and minB . When the value of control gene 
is greater than maxB , the corresponding parameter gene is 
activated (ON). On the other hand, if its value is less than minB , 
the corresponding parameter gene is deactivated (OFF). When 
the value is within min max( , )B B , the parameter gene is regulated 
by a linear scaling. The function of mapping for status is 
respectively shown in Figure1. 
The structured genetic mapping from c to p is defined as

where Y  represents an ordered set consisting of c and p ,   
is called as the genetic switch, and   denotes an empty element. 
Variations of maxB and minB are defined by the following rules:

  max min12midR R R   (125) 
where maxR  and minR  are the maximum and minimum 
boundaries, ig  denotes the current generation, initg  and fing  are 
the initial and final generations, and iB kg  with k being a 
positive constant. 
The current boundaries maxB  and minB  would be shifted 
when ig  increases such that the parameter searching range 
extends. Through a boundary sizing, the RSGA provides a 
switch function in the early stage of generation, emphasizing 
structural optimization. While the boundary increases gradually 
with generation number, it is a linear scaling function. When 
reaching the end of the generation, min max( , )B B  replaces 
min max( , )R R  and the working algorithm focuses onto the 
parameter optimization.  
2.2. Reproduction 
In the reproduction process, we utilize the population in the 
current generation to create a new population for the next 
27 
 
process of biological digital-like logic circuits can be 
constructed. 
3.1 Biological Logic State 
Biological logic phenomenon has been discovered in 
many biomolecular and chemical experimentations [11]. 
However, these modules are high irregular and not systematic. 
They are very difficult to be redesigned by an intelligent 
computing algorithm for optimal parameter searching. To 
improve this situation, a class of more powerful functions, cis-
transcriptional regulatory functions, was established from a 
straigntforward map between promoter structure and logic 
phenotype. It is given profound attention in recent years. 
3.2 Cis-Regulatory Input Function（CRIF） 
The transfer function of transcription gate describes the 
steady-state response of single-input and dual-input gates. This 
form of translation control was derived from the biochemical 
interactions. The regulatory molecules of transcription-
regulation process have been recognized as an important factor 
to in living cell. The regulators control the transcription rate of 
genes by binding to specific sites in the gene’s cis-regulatory 
region (CRR) [13]. A gene is often regulated by multiple 
transcription factors that bind their CRR performing the 
function of the active concentrations of the input transcription 
factors. The rate of transcription, the response of these inputs, 
is described by the cis-regulatory input function (CRIF). 
Analyzing the activity of lac promoter of the inducers, cAMP 
and IPTG, a simple model can be built up [14]. Solving the 
equilibrium reactions, the input function is
                                                                                                                                                           We summarize the ideas above [13-15, 23-25, 28] and 
propose a novel general model that it can include logic 
functions principally. Firstly, we propose the model of single 
transcription factor can be used to synthesize the single logic 
functions, such as NOT and Buffer:

are the Hill coefficients that describes the cooperativity. 
Next, the model of two transcription factor can be used to 
synthesize the logic functions such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, 
XOR.

3.4 Transcription CRIF Gates Design 
The RSGA not only is capable of searching unknown 
parameters but also makes the optimal system structure 
possible. In the application of our proposed CRIF model design, 
a chromosome includes a set of control genes and parameter 
genes that represent regulative parameters and search for the 
parameters respectively.  
3.4.1. Structured Genetic Mapping for Biological Gates 
In RSGA, structured genetic mapping operation plays an 
important role to produce different structures of the model. The 
control genes govern the relative parameter genes and make 
them operate in the structured mapping (122). To arrange the 
RSGA structured mapping in pairs, the novel CRIF models are 
added the exponential parameters as in the following 
expression. 
We consider the model of two transcription factors:

 Figure 4 illustrates the response of the biological NOR, NAND 
and XOR gate. 
Regulation factors model of logic gates is shown as 
Figure5. 
In the proposed design process, the total generation 
number is set to be 200, population size is 400 and the weight 
factor  is 0.6. maxR  and minR  are set to be 5 and 0, 
respectively.  
To compare the computational result of the proposed 
RSGA and the neural network approach [33], we show the 
representative edge curve of logic gate response based on 
various designs and standard sigmoid curve in Figures 6-7. 
Performances of different designs can be clearly identified 
from the figure. Because the biological XOR is an 
unsymmetrical response shown in Figure 7, we compare the 
edge curve in two points of view. For this kind of plot, every 
curves can compare with each others. The closer to the 
standard sigmoid curve gets, the better one is.  
Tolerance errors (146) of various designs are given in 
Table 2. _compare ANDE  is the tolerance error of AND gate, 
_compare ORE  is the tolerance error of OR gate, _compare NANDE  is the 
tolerance error of NAND gate, _ 1compare XORE  is the tolerance 
error of XOR gate, _ 2compare XORE  is the tolerance error of XOR 
gate in another point of view.  
For AND, OR, and NAND, our proposed approach 
performs better than the neural network approach. Though 
RSGA design is lightly worse than neural network approach in 
XOR in first point of view, our design is much better in another 
point of view. These results reveal that RSGA approach is 
satisfactory for designing biological gates. 
4. Biological Circuit Design based on Transcription Gates 
By using the transcription gates described in the previous 
chapter, it is possible to construct more complex biological 
circuits. In order to interconnect logic gates, the output of last 
gate should be a transcription factor (TF) protein used as input 
of next gate. The connection of two gates is realized by 
choosing a suited gene for the last gate that encodes a protein 
which acts as a TF for the next gate [21, 35]. In addition, 
selecting promoters experimentally is like replacing 
components in electric engineering. The promoter is turned on 
by TF and is used as the input to next gate. Therefore, it is 
important to build up a database of biological parts for 
proofreading and realizing in vivo [27].  
4.1. Combinational Circuits 
4.1.1. Full Adder  
The biological full adder that consists two XOR gates, 
two AND gates and one OR gate. It can operate binary add 
operation for three inputs, A , B  and inC . inC  is the carry 
input. So, full adder can deal with carry-add operation. A full 
adder can be composed of two half adders. The cascade 
diagram is shown in Figure 8(a). The truth table is shown in 
Table 3. Figure 8(b) illustrates the output response of the 
biological full adder. 
The left bar chart is carry output C , and the right bar 
chart is sum S . Biological half adder can deals with the three-
input binary add operation. To extend to more complex ripple 
adder, the carry output outC  of full adder can be connected to 
the carry input inC  of next full adder. 
4.1.2. Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) 
Combining the capabilities of AND gate, OR gate, NOT 
gate, the full adder, and the multiplexer designed in the 
previous section, we proceed to design the biological 
Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU), which is a basic building block 
of a transcription-regular CPU. Inputs 0Q , 1Q , 2Q , 3Q  , which 
can select the AND, OR, invert and sum operation respectively 
on inputs A  and B . The cascade diagram is shown in Figure 
9(a). Figure 9(b) illustrates the output response of the 
biological ALU. 
We use the function of multiplexer to select the function 
AND, OR, NOT and the full adder. This circuit can deal with 
many arithmetic problems.  
4.2 Sequence Logic Circuits 
4.2.1 J-K Flip- Flop  
The biological J-K flip-flop consists two NAND gates. 
The cascade diagram is shown in Figure 10(a). The three-input 
NAND consists of an AND and a NAND gate shown in Figure 
10(b). The truth table is shown in Table 4. Figure 10(c) 
illustrates the output response of the biological J-k flip flop. 
The biological J-k flip flop modifies the invalid condition 
of biological S-R Latch. When both inputs J  and K  are high, 
the output Q  becomes opposite. That is to say, if output Q  is 
0 originally, it becomes 1 at next state. It is an important 
element to construct complex sequence circuit. 
5. Conclusions 
The real structure genetic algorithm (RSGA) approach has 
been firstly proposed for the optimal design of synthetic 
genetic oscillator tracking which is regarded as the design 
problem from the control engineering viewpoint. The design 
approach is able to achieve the robust oscillator with a cheaper 
structure than that obtained by the existing approaches, while 
being robust against noise corruption. The proposed approach 
is also successfully applied to the transcription logic gates 
design problem. It is shown that this approach can achieve 
satisfactory performance for the optimal design of bio-CRIF 
gates. We have also extended our research to establish a 
conceptualized designing framework of steady-state 
combinational and sequence logic circuits. This research is 
seek for becoming a foundation of Boolean computing in vivo.

Abstract: Synthetic biology is highly valued in the recent decade. In a previous study, Elowitz and Leibler 
(Nature, vol. 403, pp. 335-338, 2000) have constructed a biological oscillator in consisting of three genes, 
and found out its mathematical expressions. Designing the optimal transcription rates of mRNA and the 
decay rates of protein concentration to track desired sinusoidal signal and achieve the best oscillation have 
been becoming a challenge problem since then. Actually, design of an oscillator can be regarded as a 
tracking design problem from the control engineer’s viewpoint. Genetic algorithm (GA) bears the feature 
of searching the global optimum for the optimization problem. However, subject to the fixed solution 
structure, the results may not be the cheap ones. In this paper, we introduce the real structure genetic 
algorithm (RSGA) to solve the design problem of synthetic biological oscillators. The design approach is 
shown to be capable of yielding genetic oscillators with a cheaper structure. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary application in 
molecular biology and engineering. Inspired by electronic 
logical elements, several recent studies have stated the 
possibility of realizing a genetic circuit, which is foreseen to 
have significant contribution to cancer medicine as well as to 
a variety of bio-energy sources (Hasty et al. 2002; Dasika and 
Maranas, 2008). Elowitz and Leibler (2000) have proposed a 
genetic ring oscillator known as repressilator consisting of 
three genes: tetR, lacI, λcI. The three genes repress each other 
like a ring oscillation circuit comprising three NOT logic 
gates and induces green fluorescent protein oscillation. That 
transcriptional regulation oscillation behavior can be modelled 
based on several factors, including mRNA, the dependence of 
transcription rates on repressor concentration, and the decay 
rates of the protein and the translation rates of mRNA. 
Design of a genetic oscillator with desired amplitude, phase, 
and frequency was previously thought to be a tracking design 
problem. However, the stochastic intrinsic dynamic noises and 
extrinsic disturbances can perturb the oscillatory behaviors, 
and preservation of robustness to these noises became an 
important topic (Dasika and Maranas, 2008). In (Chen and 
Chen, 2010), genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed to achieve 
a robust design to the oscillatory behaviors. GA imitates the 
evolutionary processes appearing in nature, e.g. selection, 
reproduction, crossover, and mutation. The existing GA-based 
design searches for an optimal pair of parameters including 
decay rates of protein concentrations and the transcription 
rates of mRNA. However, directly applying that approach 
usually leads to premature convergence of the solution and 
brings solutions with the cheapest structure.  
In the present study, we propose a real structured genetic 
algorithm (RSGA) to waive weaknesses of the traditional GAs, 
i.e. premature convergence of parameters and lack a 
mechanism for optimizing the solution structure (Tsai et al. 
2009; Tsai et al. 2011). We combine the advantages of RGA 
and SGA to simultaneously determine the optimal structure 
and parameters for synthetic biological oscillators. Designing 
the optimal transcription rates of mRNA and the decay rates 
of protein concentration to track the desired sinusoidal signals 
is demonstrated.  
This paper proposes three methods to improve the tolerance of 
the intrinsic and extrinsic noises. Firstly, increase of searching 
the undefined parameters can extend the dimension of the 
design parameter. Secondly, adjusting the hill coefficient 
would bring about change in protein concentration output. 
Finally, searching the random initial values can improve the 
transition response. These methods not only extend the design 
freedom but also simplify the structure of the oscillator 
module. 
2. GENETIC OSCILLATION MODEL 
Elowitz and Leibler (2000) used three transcriptional 
repressor systems (tetR, lacI, λcI) to construct an oscillating 
network. The first repressor, lacI, inhibits the transcription of 
the second repressor, tetR, which inhibits the expression of the 
third gene, λcI. Finally, tetR inhibits lacI's expression. 
Because the green fluorescence protein is coupled to a protein 
in the oscillating network, the oscillations are presented by the 
fluorescence in the cell. A negative feedback loop was thus 
formed (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000). That transcriptional 
regulation oscillation behavior can be modelled based on 
several factors, including mRNA, the dependence of 
transcription rates on repressor concentration, and the decay 
rates of the protein and the translation rates of mRNA. 
The dynamic system can be described by the following 
coupled first-order differential equations:

3. REAL STRUCTURE GENETIC ALGORITHM Here, 
pJ  
represents the objective function for tracking error, 
and sJ  represents an objective function for gene order. The 
constants  and are the order of genetic oscillator and 
the maximum order of genetic oscillator, respectively. The 
smaller 
N maxn
pJ  is, the more accurate of the tracking will be. A 
small value of sJ  implies a simple structure. We set the 
fitness function as follows 
Real structure genetic algorithm (RSGA) is a variant of GAs 
and SGAs. The genetic operations of RSGA include 
reproduction, crossover, and mutation. However, the control 
genes and parameter genes are both real numbers, which 
improves mathematical mechanism due to the consistent 
operators of crossover and mutation and consumes less time in 
computing ( Tsai et al. 2011). 
RSGA is an inversely design procedure to search for 
parameters. However, there is a structured genetic mapping in 
RSGA that it could make parameters operate in three 
functions. The structured mapping would generate different 
orders in genetic oscillator to search out the optimal order. 
Then, it improves the fitness value by crossover and mutation 
unceasingly. Based on this feature, RSGA achieves the 
optimal structure and parameters simultaneously for synthetic 
biological oscillators.

3.2 Structured genetic mapping 
The chromosomes consist of the control genes’ strings and the 
parameter genes’ strings. The control genes c and parameter 
genes p are both real numbers within . However, 
the parameter genes are regulated by the control genes. RSGA 
structured mapping have three gene operations: activate, 
deactivate, and linear ratio variation. The operating function 
of control genes is determined by the correlation between the 
control genes,  and . When the value of control gene 
is greater than , the corresponding parameter gene is 
activated (ON). On the other hand, if its value is less than 
, the corresponding parameter gene is deactivated (OFF). 
When the value is within , the parameter gene is 
regulated by a linear scaling. The structured genetic mapping 
from c to p is defined as

different gene-number oscillator module. Therefore, the 
optimal order may be found out. In regard to the accurate 
performance we improve the selection, crossover and 
mutation probability to a dynamic probability.  
Consider the cyclic gene regulatory network composed of 1-5 
genes to track the sinusoidal wave  
where
sin( )i iA tw f+ i

 . The parameters 
0.3465i  and 0.167im  were set as those in (Zeiser et al. 
2007). We used the proposed RSGA and received the 
following results: N=2, 
, and 
1 21 2
, , ]=[0p p [ ,  .3403 1.2853 0.0792 0.2772] 5n . 
By considering only minimization of the tracking error cost 
pJ  with three genes, the conventional GA generated an 
oscillator with related responses illustrated in Fig. 3 with the 
corresponding 
pJ  being 0.554. While considering 
minimization of , the RSGA  yielded an oscillator with 
only two genes and the corresponding  is 0.508. The 
related responses are illustrated in Fig. 4. Convergence of the 
fitness value is displayed in Fig. 5. The result demonstrates 
superiority of the proposed approach.

The robust design of genetic oscillator to tolerate intrinsic and 
extrinsic noises is more meaningful in vivo. To bring 
uncertain fluctuations into the module, we consider (2) and 
show the performance in Fig. 6. As seen, the amplitude and 
phase would be interfered by the intrinsic parameter 
fluctuations and extrinsic disturbances. In addition, the 
evolution process of the fitness exhibits an unsteady 
behaviour (see Fig. 7). With 
 the corresponding

[ , , , , , ]=[1.45 0.466 0 0 p p p     
1.435 0.464 1.392 0.504 0 0] pJ  is 0.5212. 
This shows that existence of the intrinsic and extrinsic noises 
would deteriorate the accuracy of oscillation.  
To improve the deficiency, we propose three methods. Firstly, 
instead of searching for the parameter  and ia ip  in (1), two 
extra parameters 
im
  and are involved in the parameter 
searching. It can be applied to extend the parameter searching 
space from two parameters to four parameters. As shown in 
Fig. 8, searching four parameters, 
b
im
 ,  , , and ia ib ip  
improves the tracking performance. Secondly, adjusting the 
hill coefficient can bring changes in protein concentration 
output. It was observed from the experimental results that the 
amplitude and frequency of oscillation increase as the hill 
coefficient increases. In contrast, a smaller hill coefficient 
results in smaller amplitude and frequency. As a result, if the 
hill coefficient is small enough, then the protein concentration 
will converge to a steady level. Alternately, searching for the 
random initial values can improve the transition response. The 
three methods not only extend the design freedom but also 
simplify the structure of the oscillator module. With 
the corresponding  is 0.1928. The method of four 
parameter searching improves the accuracy, but it losses the 
optimal structure. In other words, the order of the optimal 
oscillator is increased to three.
