（二）研究計畫之背景及目的:
研究計畫之背景:
多葉準直儀系統已被用於取代高能直線加速器四方形照野擋塊，以形成不規則形照野的一
個方便且有效的替代工具，目前已應用於光子射束；由於其以電腦驅動的高靈活性，臨床
上可幾乎完全取代低熔點鉛合金擋塊，並完全消除誤置擋塊的錯誤情形。因此，一般已列
為加速器的標準配備，且有關多葉準直儀對光子劑量學特性方面的影響已有廣泛的研究；
然而，對於電子射束應用方面則才剛剛起步，因此，本計畫擬參考國外最新文獻，自行設
計一套簡便式的手動式電子射束多葉準直儀系統，進行臨床劑量學之測量與評估。
An electron multileaf collimator (eMLC) has the potential to revolutionize electron therapy just
as the x-ray multileaf collimator (xMLC ) has for x-ray therapy. The xMLC has proven to be
useful for shaping irregular fields, compensating for missing tissue, and allowing intensity
modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT), thus replacing the need for the fabrication of custom blocking,
wedges, and custom compensators.1Similarly, an eMLC could be useful for shaping irregular
fields and allowing intensity-modulated electron therapy (IMET) , thus replacing the need for the
fabrication of custom blocking and possibly custom electron bolus. The combination of an eMLC
with an xMLC offers the potential for a radiation therapy accelerator without accessories.
The simplest application of an eMLC is its potential use in replacing custom electron field
shaping for fixed electron beams. This concept has been investigated by Ravindran et al.,2 who
demonstrated the dosimetry for an eMLC made as an“add-on”to the 15 x 15 cm2 electron
applicator for the Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Concord, CA!. Its design is analogous to one
developed by Ma et al.3 for use with the Varian Clinac 25 x 25 cm2 applicator (Varian Medical
Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Both of these de signs mimic custom applicator inserts, in that they
utilize an electron applicator for physical support. Ravindran et al. reported that the convenience
of circumventing fabrication of custom blocks is offset by the time required to install and remove
the eMLC, estimated to weigh approximately 8 kg,from the applicator.

Therefore, we hypothesize that an eMLC, separate from the xMLC, can be developed that can
meet the needs of fixed-beam, arced-beam, and modulated electron beam therapy. Our goal in the
present work is to describe the general characteristics of a novel eMLC and to demonstrate that
its dosimetry is adequate for SSD, fixed-beam therapy.
重要性及國內外有關本計畫之研究情況:

linac has an electron source location approximately 90 cm from the isocenter.19 The latter results
in significant disagreement of the light and electron fields projected by the MLC20 and of the
electron and x-ray fields projected by the xMLC. Ma et al.3 stated that a requirement for
mixed-beam therapy is that the virtual sources of the x-ray and electron beams share a common
location. Karlsson and Zackrisson,21 Zackrisson and Karlsson,14 and Jansson et al.22
demonstrated that the MLC on a Scanditronix MM50 racetrack microtron, designed by Brahme,23
can also serve as a clinically useful eMLC. The electron penumbra remains sufficiently small for
its utilization because (1) the downstream edge of the xMLC is only 35 cm above the isocenter,
(2) the head of the machine is filled with helium, (3) the virtual source is small, owing to the
utilization of a scanned beam, (4) the leaves are doubly focused, and (5) treatments are isocentric
or at a shorter SSD. In general, xMLCs from other manufacturers are insufficient to be used as
eMLCs because (1) the downstream edges are too far from the isocenter, (2) the heads of the
machines contain air, which causes significant electron scattering, and (3) the virtual sources are
large because the beams are broadened by dual scattering foil systems. The Siemens MLC is
located 65.7 cm from the isocenter, making the resulting penumbra particularly large. Rectifying
these issues has been the subject of ongoing research.24–26
Some combination of optimal location, utilization of scanned beams, helium atmosphere in the
head, and the utilization of isocentric electron therapy should allow the xMLC to be used for both
x-ray and electron therapy. Although researchers are investigating practical solutions that utilize
one or more of these design features, an attractive alternative is a separate eMLC for electrons. A
separate eMLC can be manufactured as an add-on to existing radiotherapy accelerators, whereas
the use of a single MLC will likely require a redesign of the complete treatment head and likely
not be a simple upgradable solution.

varies within transverse planes require varying the shape of the secondary collimator with an arc
angle to achieve optimal dose homogeneity. The eMLC can f ulfill that need, as demonstrated by
a prototype eMLC developed by Leavitt et al.5
B. Range of field sizes
The larger the maximum field size, the heavier and more bulky an eMLC becomes. To select an
optimal maximum field size, A 97% of all electron fractions can be treated using a 20 x20 cm2 or
smaller applicator. Therefore, the eMLC has been designed to be 21 cm (dimension perpendicular
to leaf travel)x20 cm. An odd number of leaves is required so that the eMLC center leaf straddles
the central axis and hence can precisely mirror the xMLC leaf positions for seamless matching
with x-ray fields. Designing a maximum field size of 20x21 cm2 at the isocenter for the eMLC at
its 90 cm SCD position restricts the x-ray field size to approximately 31x33 cm2 when the eMLC
is fully open and at its fully retracted position.
C. Leaf width and shape
In our initial prototype, the physical leaf width is 0.9 cm, projecting to a width of 1.0 cm at the
isocenter for a SCD of 90 cm. This allows the eMLC leaf edges to closely match those of the
xMLC. In the plane perpendicular to leaf motion, the leaf cross sections are focused toward
a point 85 cm above the bottom of the leaves. This distance is chosen so that the leaves focus
within 5 cm of the primary foil location ~the approximate position of the virtual source. for both
the 80 and 90 cm SCD positions. Figure 2 shows the cross section of each of the 21 leaves.
A key difference between our eMLC and those previously reported by Ma et al.3 and Ravindra et
al.2 is that we have opted to have a design that is“effectively”doubly divergent. Although Lee et
al.8 concluded that diverging leaf edges were unnecessary, their conclusions were based on single
field treatments and the leaf edge being 5.0 cm off the central axis. They showed that scattered
electrons were significant, but not detrimental to the dose distribution; however, our design
allows edges 10.5 cm off-axis for which scatter would become more significant for nondivergent
edges. We expect diverging leaves to result in less scattered electrons, which should simplify the
dose calculation and optimization process for intensity-modulated therapy. Another significant
complication with nondiverging leaves is that the effective leaf width of a leaf opening changes
as the leaf aperture moves off-axis.
For ease of construction, the leaves are designed to rest on a flat surface. This prohibits making
the leaves doubly focused; however, double focusing was effectively achieved by the following
design specification. In the plane parallel to the central axis and containing the direction of leaf
motion, the leaf ends are rounded, and the radius of curvature is selected so that the bottom of the
leaf is tangent to a ray from a point source 85 cm above the leaf when fully open and the top of
the leaf is tangent to a ray when the leaf is fully across the field. At the central-axis position, the
ray is tangent to the middle of the leaf. Figure 3 illustrates this design concept.
D. Leaf motion and positioning
Each eMLC leaf should be capable of fully crossing the beam, i.e., 18 cm of travel ~20 cm
projected to the isocenter for 90 cm SCD!. This specification allows the utilization of
intensity-modulated therapy over the full field. Also, because of the curved leaf ends, it will be
advantageous to position the abutted borders of unused leaves away from the central axis,
avoiding potential electron leakage at the higher energies. Because the leaves travel completely
with the brass slabs removed. The films were scanned using theWellhoerWP700
software(ScanditronixWellhofer, Bartell, TN) and Lumiscan 75 laser densitometer (Eastman
Kodak, Rochester, NY). Film background was determined by developing an unexposed film at
the time of irradiation. The films were scanned along a line intersecting central axis of the beam
and perpendicular to the slit. The slit widths, adjusted using calibrated shims, were 0.025, 0.075,
and 0.125 mm. Optical density was converted to dose using a calibration curve measured by
exposing a film to a range of electron beam doses. The resulting data consisted of a slowly
varying bremsstrahlung background with a sharp electron leakage peak superimposed. The
electron dose component was extracted by subtracting the bremsstrahlung background from the
data, with the background values under the electron peak being interpolated from the
bremsstrahlung curve outside the electron peak.
B. Lateral electron leakage
The purpose of these data is to verify and fine-tune the collimator design discussed previously.
Lateral electron leakage was studied by measuring the off-axis profiles at a depth of 1 cm in a
solid water phantom. The exposure was for approximately 1 Gy to give a maximum optical
density in the profile of approximately 2. Optical density was converted to dose. The profile was
backprojected from 91 to 90 cm, so as to estimate the measured profile at the position of the
eMLC leaf bed (90 cm SCD). These measurements were made using the 5 and 15 MeV electron
beams. The 5 MeV beam is the most significant, because lower-energy electrons undergo the
most multiple Coulomb scattering, which can result in lateral electron leakage. In the first set of
measurements, the x-ray jaw settings were decreased until flatness within the eMLC field became
affected, i.e. from 36x36 to 28x28 cm2 in increments of 2 cm. Also, the penumbra of the profile
was compared with the lateral extent of the leaf bed enclosure to verify that the lateral leakage at
90 cm SCD was less than 2%.
C. X-ray leakage
X-ray leakage for the eMLC was measured for the 5, 10, and 15 MeV beams by closing all leaves
with the abutment at the midline. A dose profile, underlying the central leaf pair was measured
using Kodak XV-2 film at a depth of 1 cm in a solid-water phantom at 100 cm SSD. The same
film system as discussed previously was used, and the electron calibration curve was used for the
x-ray leakage dose. The film was exposed to the same monitor units to deliver 4 Gy to R100 for
the eMLC opened to 21x20 cm2. The results were normalized relative to the Dmax dose with the
eMLC fully open.
D. Penumbral characteristics
These measurements tested the design goal that the beam penumbra is independent of leaf
position and leaf direction. Dose was measured along both major axes at a depth of 1 cm in a
water phantom at 100 cm SSD. The off-axis scans were measured for the 5, 10, and 15 MeV
beams. The relative dose was measured using the Scanditronix diode detector with theWellho‥
fer beam scanner. All scan data were normalized to the central-axis reading of the open field. In
the direction perpendicular to leaf motion, the dose profile was measured for the 20321 cm2,
fully opened eMLC. Leaf pairs on one side of the beam were then closed in increments of 3,
resulting in measurements for field widths of 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, and 3 cm. In the direction of
leaf motion, the dose profile was measured first for the 20321 cm2, fully opened field. One bank
of leaves was then moved in 3 cm increments, resulting in measurements for field widths of 20,
