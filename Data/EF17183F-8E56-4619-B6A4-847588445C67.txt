to understand the mechanism for the cross-interaction of these two 
types of flux, the experiment must be performed at a constant 
temperature. In this study, a cooling system with a PID controller 
was used. The chip temperature would be kept constant at 60 oC. 
The effect of current density on failure mechanism and interfacial 
reaction will be discussed. The current density used in this study 
was up to 104 A/cm2. This method provided a way to de-couple the 
applied current density and the device temperature. Further, the 
study also discovered that ’temperature’ is one of the key factors 
affecting the dominant electromigration-induced degradation 
mechanisms. In the traditional electromigration accelerated tests at 
high temperature, the major degradation is the void formation and 
propagation. However, in low-temperature electromigration test, we 
find that the dominant electromigration is the metallic consumption, 
not void formation. The discovery clarifies the mechanisms related 
to the electromigration-induced degradation, and provides 
significant contribution to the microelectronic industry.  
At this time, according to the resulting of this project, we had 
published 27 papers in the international journals [1-17], 2 journal 
papers under review [28-29], and 32 papers presented in the 
conferences [30-61].

一、 前言 
隨著電子產品輕、薄、短、小之發展，封裝方式也有明顯的改變，封裝型態往高 I/O 密度封裝發
展。近幾年來，覆晶(flip-chip)封裝技術已經成為高階電子元件封裝的最佳選擇。「覆晶封裝」其名乃是
一種藉由翻轉晶片並以錫球直接與基板作連接的方法而來。因此 I/O 可以分布在整各晶片的表面，藉
由此特性晶片尺寸可以大幅縮小。然而，隨著元件尺寸的縮小，銲點的尺寸跟著變小。但流經銲點的
電流不變，因此銲點中的電流密度將快速增加。2006 年 12 月最新改版之 International Technology 
Roadmap for Semiconductors 即指出覆晶科技之電遷移問題將成為半導體科技之主要之限制性因素之一
[62]。 
綜觀目前的文獻可知，覆晶銲點的電遷移研究中，由於覆晶元件中特殊的 line-to-bump 結構的特殊
幾何形狀，造成電子流由導線流入銲點時，在銲點與導線接觸的區域產生嚴重的 current crowding 現象，
此一局部區域的極高電流密度加速了材料受電遷移現象之影響[63]。此外，通電時衍生的 Joule heating 
效應，使得電遷移時將伴隨著 thermal stress 及較高之樣品溫度 [64, 65]。此一升溫效應在 current 
crowding 區域也會特別嚴重。隨著樣品度升高，銲料與 UBM 金屬層的界面反應速率亦隨之加快。事
實上縱然在無 current crowding 效應下及在 Joule heating 效應可忽略不計的條件下，僅僅電遷移效應本
身就會對界面反應造成顯著之影響[66-76]。由以上之敘述可知，電遷移對覆晶元件的影響須同時考慮
到電遷移現象、current crowding effect、Joule heating effect、界面反應等眾多因素。多種物理、化學作
用同時存在，且各作用之間有耦合(coupling)現象，是一個相當複雜且具挑戰性之問題。最近幾年由於
國際間眾多研究群之努力投入，對上述眾多因素之個別效應之瞭解已有長足之進步。但是對這些因素
間之交互作用，目前所知甚少。本研究計畫之主要目的是探討電遷移擴散與化學位能擴散之交互作用，
並探討此一交互作用對覆晶科技可靠度之影響。 
電遷移通量為銲點通電時，電子會撞擊導線金屬原子，足夠的動量轉移而輔助了原子擴散。由於
電遷移現象中之原子遷移是電子動量轉移所致，因此原子遷移的方向也與電子流的方向相同。化學位
能梯度通量指的是原子因化學位能梯度，而由該元素之高化學位能區域朝低化學位能區域之擴散。Cu  
及 Ni 都是 UBM 及 surface finish 所廣泛使用之材料，而 Cu/solder/Ni 此一三明治結構又是封裝中橫跨
銲點最常見之材料順序。由本實驗室過去的研究成果可知，當電流通過此類銲點時，電遷移通量與化
學位能通量將同時存在，並產生交互作用。此結果更進一步地指出，化學位能通量與電遷移通量其數
量級已相當接近。因此電遷移研究中對此兩通量之交互作用的了解就顯的相當重要，此一現象可能成
為影響覆晶銲點中金屬層的可靠度的議題之一。此外，Cu 與 Ni 原子的電遷移擴散是以間隙擴散的形
式，而 Sn 原子的電遷移擴散則是自擴散，因此兩者所造成的效應也大不相同。本研究使用低溫的電遷
移測試也有助於釐清銲點內複雜的電遷移行為。 
 
二、 研究目的 
本計劃之主要目的是更進一步深入探討化學位能通量與電遷移通量相互影響之機制。然而在通電
的過程中，電流產生的焦耳熱，使得銲點內部溫度大幅上升，溫度也會進而影響銲點界面反應及擴散
行為。為了釐清兩通量對介金屬型態之影響及其機制，實驗必須在恆溫的條件下進行。在第一年度的
研究中，我們已初步建立了一精密的溫度控制裝置來進行通電實驗，並利用此裝置進一步減緩焦耳熱
效應的影響，以保持通電時溫度的穩定。在第二年度的研究中，我們將沿用此裝置，將試片溫度及電
流密度兩變數獨立控制，並更進一步探討固定溫度下，不同電流密度對其失效機制及界面反應之影響，
並發現低溫與傳統高溫的電遷移測試有截然不同的結果。 
本年度我們更進一步進行材料擴散動力學的分析，驗證在銲點中不同物質的電遷移通量是造成高
溫與低溫電遷移損耗機制不同的原因。並將此低溫散熱裝置應用於多種覆晶封裝的電遷移測試，以實

(b)加裝散熱溫控系統的覆晶通電測試 
當通以相同超高電流密度大小並加裝散熱裝置於試片兩端時，試片溫度能夠維持恆溫於 60 oC。同
時，散熱裝置的安裝，有效地延後了試片發生失效的時間，此試片於 935 小時通電測試之後，在鋁導
線發生失效。儘管失效仍然發生於鋁導線，但我們注意到銲錫球中內部微結構與未加裝散熱裝置之銲
錫球微結構，具有相當大的差異。 
圖五為加裝散熱裝置進行 935 小時通電測試之後的 SEM 圖，比較圖五(a)與(b)兩圖，同樣地可以
看出，電子流的方向對銲點內部微結構的影響是非常明顯的。圖五(c)與(d)分別為圖五(a)與(b)晶片端之
放大圖。在圖五(c)中，可以看到局部位置的(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 被溶解於銲料之中，而在圖五(d)，可以看到
在大量的(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5生成於晶片端左側，即電子流流出的位置處。而圖五(e)與(f)分別為圖五(a)與(b)
基板端之放大圖。儘管兩基板端所生成之介金屬皆為(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5，但其形貌具有相當大的差異。在
圖五(e)中，介金屬是以較平坦之層狀外形生成於 Cu 基板端，而在圖五(f)中，基板端產生一個相當不
規則之形貌。此不規則形貌不斷地在我們實驗結果中發生，而不是少數試片才有的現象，初步研判，
並非試片製程所引起的現象。同時這個不規則形貌，僅發現於低溫高電流密度之下，我們認為這微結
構特徵主要是電子遷移擴散所引發的。然而此不規則形貌發生的機制目前尚無法進行解釋，必須要有
更進一步的實驗進行，才能對這個現象有一個更深入的了解。 
從以上結果，可以得知在電遷移通電測試時，適當的冷卻控溫是有效且必要的，若能善用冷卻控
溫裝置，就能將試片溫度及電流密度兩變數獨立控制。同時，在超高電流密度的實驗中，運用冷卻控
溫裝置亦能有效延長試片壽命，並觀察到在超高電流密度下，銲錫球內部微結構變化，以及電遷移造
成的原子通量與化學位能梯度的原子通量之交互影響。

3. Cu/Sn-Pb solder/Cu 覆晶封裝系統 
(a)未加裝散熱溫控系統的覆晶通電測試 
當環境溫度固定在 50 oC，但當施加 4.5×104A/cm2 電流密度時，未施加散熱裝置時覆晶試片晶片端
的溫度仍可高達 170 oC，基板端的溫度則高達 135 oC，上下端溫差高達 35 oC。整個覆晶試片在通電 7
分鐘以內便由鋁導線處先行失效，如圖八所示。造成覆晶結構在七分鐘內失效的原因，主要是由於文
獻已指出在 daisy chain 覆晶試片通電結構中鋁導線為主要發熱源，且鋁的電流密度(106A/cm2)比銲點的
平均電流密度約大 2 個數量級。因此在散熱能力不夠良好的情況下，鋁導線的高電流密度與大量焦耳
熱將使得整個通電結構提前失效，使我們難以觀察到超高電流密度下電遷移對覆晶銲點的影響。此外，
圖八顯示靠近鋁導線的 A、B 兩銲點中出現局部熔融以及共晶 SnPb 預錫(Pre-solder)的液化現象。值得
注意的是，銲點 A 中的電子流方向是由基板端流向晶片端，若根據電遷移文獻中常見的介金屬化合物
極化效應(Polarity effect)，在電子流的幫助下，陽極端的介金屬厚度應該將大於陰極端的介金屬厚度。
然而我們卻觀察到相反的現象。其主要原因可能是由於實驗過程中鋁導線所產生的高溫度梯度導致的
熱遷移現象，使得銲點 A 中熱遷移驅動力(由晶片端向基板端)遠大於電遷移驅動力(由基板端向晶片端)
所致，才會使得 Cu6Sn5 介金屬化合物於銲點 A 的陰極端生成。銲點 B 的電子流方向是由晶片端流向基
板端，因此在熱遷移與電遷移兩效應同方向的加成下，晶片端的 Cu UBM 與銲點 A 相較之下大量被消
耗，並在基板端形成大量的 Cu6Sn5 介金屬化合物。另外，由銲點 A 與銲點 B 微結構中的鉛相分佈，可
觀察到銲點在失效後的冷卻過程中出現方向性凝固。

有大量的 Cu 原子被溶解進入銲錫中。 
 
 
 
五、 討論 
1.  負極端鋸齒狀形貌 
關於此鋸齒狀形貌的形成原因，本研究試圖以電性的角度來進行解釋。在本實驗所使用之銲點結
構中，界面處依序為 Sn-2.6Ag、Cu6Sn5 (忽略 Cu3Sn)、與 Cu，由於 Cu 的電阻係數最小，依次為銲料、
Cu6Sn5，加上 Cu6Sn5 於迴焊後會以扇貝狀的型式生成於銲點界面處，因此當大量電子流欲由負極端往
正極端移動時。電子流傾向走電阻相對較小的路徑(電阻係數分別為 Cu : 1.7 μΩ cm；Sn : 11.5 μΩ cm；
Cu6Sn5 : 17.5 μΩ cm )，會導致電子較易從 Cu6Sn5 之間的 groove 處通過。一旦 groove 處的 Cu6Sn5 被電
子流推動而溶入銲料中時，此處的 Cu 金屬層將不再受介金屬保護，將迅速地被電子流往銲料方向推
送，因此長時間下來 groove 處便呈現鋸齒狀形貌。此外，我們的實驗條件設定為低溫(50 oC)與超高電
流密度(4.5×104A/cm2 )，相較於高溫，在低溫下 Cu 原子與 Sn 原子的擴散速度差距將更大；另一方面
高電流密度也是其中一項原因。由於過去文獻中的電遷移加速測試，往往以高溫(150 oC)、低電流密度
進行，因此這也是為什麼目前在文獻上較不易看到類似本實驗中「Sawtooth morphology」的結果。

我們利用相同的分析方法對常用的金屬層原子進行計算，如 Cu、Ni、Au 與 Ag 等。這些原子在銲
錫中皆有快速擴散的性質。因 Sn 之晶體結構屬 BCT (body-centered tetragonal)，故原子沿 a-axis 與 c-axis
有不同的擴散係數，我們也對此非等向性的電遷移通量進行分析，如圖四所示。結果顯示不同的 Sn 晶
格方向會導致電遷移通量比例有很大的差異，表示 Sn 晶格方向也是影響電遷移主導行為的因素之一，
此分析結果與文獻[76]中的實驗結果一致。關於此研究實驗仍在進行中。

diﬀusion exhibit very diﬀerent activation energies, and in
fact the activation energy of Sn diﬀusion in matrix Sn is
three times higher than that of Cu diﬀusion in Sn [7,8].
Such a large diﬀerence in activation energy suggests that
temperature may play a very important role in determining
the dominant degradation mechanism. The objective of the
present study is to analyze the temperature eﬀects on Cu
and Sn electromigration ﬂuxes in Sn. The analysis is then
applied to describing the dominant microstructure evolu-
tion under current stressing at various temperatures.
Experiments are also carried out to verify whether the anal-
ysis has captured suﬃcient features of the system.
2. Analysis
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of electromigra-
tion in a simple Cu/Sn/Cu system. It is assumed that the
electron current ﬂows evenly upwards, and no current
crowding is allowed. A layer of Cu6Sn5 exists on both inter-
faces. In certain experimental conditions, a layer of Cu3Sn
might also exist between Cu and Cu6Sn5, but it will become
clear later that the existence or absence of Cu3Sn will not
interfere with the following analysis. Consider a small con-
trol volume of Sn very close to the cathode side, shown in
the region enclosed by red dashed line in Fig. 1. Within this
control volume, there is a small amount of dissolved Cu
atoms. Since this control volume is near the cathode, it is
assumed that local equilibrium has been established, and
Cu has reached its solubility limit in Sn within the control
volume.
The electromigration ﬂuxes of Cu, JCu, and Sn, JSn,
illustrated in Fig. 1 can be written, respectively, as [9]
JCu ¼ CCu DCukT z

CueqSnj ð1Þ
JSn ¼ CSn DSnkT z

SneqSnj ð2Þ
where CCu and CSn are the local molar concentrations
(mole per unit volume) of Cu and Sn in the control volume,
respectively; DCu and DSn are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of
Cu in Sn and Sn in Sn, respectively; zCu and z

Sn are the
eﬀective charge numbers of Cu in Sn and Sn in Sn, respec-
tively. The symbol k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the
absolute temperature, e is the charge of an electron, qSn
is the resistivity of Sn, and j is the applied electron current
density.
Dividing Eq. (1) by Eq. (2), one obtains the electromi-
gration ﬂux ratio of Cu to Sn within the control volume as
JCu
JSn
¼ CCuDCuz

Cu
CSnDSnzSn
ð3Þ
Eq. (3) can be simpliﬁed as
JCu
JSn
¼ XCu DCuz

Cu
DSnzSn
ð4Þ
where XCu is the mole fraction of Cu in the control volume.
This simpliﬁcation is valid because the maximum Cu mole
fraction in Sn is 0.0001 [10]. With the assumption that local
thermodynamic equilibrium has been established for the
control volume, XCu is simply the saturated limit of Cu in
Sn at a certain temperature.
In Eq. (4), the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the Cu solubility
are all very strong functions of temperature. In fact, they
all vary exponentially with temperature, as will be dis-
cussed in detail later. The eﬀective charge, however, is only
a weak function of temperature [11]. It was also pointed
out by Orchard and Greer [12] that the temperature varia-
tion of the eﬀective charge is likely to be dwarfed by the
temperature variation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. With
these diﬀerent temperature dependencies in mind, it is
assumed in the following analysis that the temperature var-
iation in the ratio zCu=z

Sn is negligibly small compared with
those of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and solubility. Conse-
quently, Eq. (4) can be written as
JCu
JSn
¼ CXCu DCuDSn ð5Þ
where C equals zCu=z

Sn and is a temperature-independent
constant with an order-of-magnitude value of one.
In the following, the temperature dependencies for those
two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (5) are discussed in
detail so that the ratio of the Cu electromigration ﬂux to
that of Sn within the control volume can be analyzed.
2.1. Eﬀect of temperature on the solubility of Cu in solid Sn
phase
The solubility of Cu in solid Sn phase was reported to be
0.01 at.% Cu [10], but its temperature dependence, i.e., the
solvus line in Sn-rich region, has not been experimentally
measured. From formal thermodynamic consideration,
the solvus line in systems of limited terminal solubility
can be described by an Arrhenius equation [13]:
XCu ¼ A exp  BkT
 
ð6Þ
where A and B are temperature-independent constants.
From the thermodynamic assessments of the Cu–Sn system
by various investigators [14,15], A and B can be estimated

Sn/Cu system where no current crowding is present.

consumption will be the dominant features at low temper-
atures. This is because the applied current has the ability to
drive the dissolved Cu atoms away from the cathode side
very quickly. This makes the local Cu concentration near
the cathode drop below saturation, so that the dissolution
of Cu6Sn5 and/or the Cu cathode are accelerated. Under
such a condition, before enough Sn atoms are driven away
and the void has enough driving force to nucleate, the
excessive metallization consumption has already become
a problem. In contrast, if the solder temperature is high,
the ratio JCu/JSn becomes smaller, and Cu and Sn electro-
migration ﬂux becomes relatively comparable. Under this
condition, not only the metallization consumption but also
pancake-type void formation may become the dominant
mechanisms. This is because the excessive out-diﬀusion of
Sn creates the driving force for the nucleation of the pan-
cake-type void.
In summary, the above analysis suggests that tempera-
ture is the key factor determining the dominant mecha-
nism. The formation of a pancake-type void tends to be
the dominant mechanism at high temperatures, and the
excessive consumption of metallization layer tends to be
the dominant mechanism at low temperatures.
3. Experimental
To conﬁrm the proposition that temperature is the key
factor determining the dominant mechanism, one needs
to carry out electromigration tests under both high-temper-
ature and low-temperature conditions, using test samples
with the same internal conﬁguration.
Fig. 5 schematically depicts the solder joints used in this
study. The solder alloy was composed of Sn–0.7Cu (wt.%).
The under-bump metallurgy (UBM) on the chip side
employed a Ti/Ni(V)/Cu structure, while the metallization
on the substrate side was a 15-lm layer of Cu. Solder joints
were connected by on-chip Al lines 1.2 lm thick and 60 lm
wide. Each solder joint had a normal diameter of 145 lm,
and the diameter of the contact window was 90 lm.
Standard underﬁll was applied between the chip and the
substrate. The internal circuit of the dies was a daisy-chain
design, with several external leads built in for electric con-
nection and resistance monitoring.
The technique of temperature control for ﬂip chip solder
joints during current stressing was described in a previous
publication [17], and the details are omitted here for brev-
ity. In short, the chips were cooled by a brass cooling
block, through which cooling water circulated with regu-
lated temperature and ﬂow rate.
The chip surface temperature of the back side (the side
without solder joints) was maintained at 60 C by the cool-
ing system. An electron current of 2.86 A or 3.50 A was
applied, producing a nominal current density of 4.5  104
or 5.5  104 A cm2, respectively (based on the opening
area of the contact window). Furthermore, a three-dimen-
sional ﬁnite-element analysis was conducted with measur-
able boundary conditions to estimate the current density
and temperature distribution within a solder joint.
The high-temperature electromigration tests using the
same test samples were carried out by turning oﬀ the cool-
ing system. To compare the electromigration test results
between high-temperature and low-temperature condi-
tions, an electron current of 0.64 A was applied, producing
a nominal current density of 1.0  104 A cm2 within the
same order of magnitude as low-temperature electromigra-
tion tests. Without the cooling system, the chip tempera-
ture became 180 C, as a result of the Joule heating eﬀect.
4. Results and discussion
Fig. 6 shows a micrograph of the ﬂip chip solder joint at
the as-assembly condition the before current stressing. A
layer of Cu6Sn5 formed at both the chip side and the sub-
strate side. The formation of only this particular com-
pound was consistent with the literature result, and the
rationale has been reported elsewhere [18].
Fig. 7a shows the microstructure of a joint that had been
stressed at 3.2 A for 185 h. The electrons entered the joint

extended along Cu6Sn5/solder interface in a direction per-
pendicular to the image surface of Fig. 9a. In addition to
void formation, Cu metallization consumption was
observed in Fig. 9a. About 5–15 lm of Cu metallization
was consumed. The compound Cu3Sn was the dominant
intermetallic compound at the cathode interface. It is gen-
erally accepted that both Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 form at the
interface of Cu and Sn during high-temperature aging.
But when a void or gap initiates and extends along
Cu6Sn5/Sn interface, Cu6Sn5 loses the source of Sn atoms.
In this case, Cu3Sn will grow at the expense of Cu6Sn5 and
Cu metallization.
The result of electromigration tests at high temperature
shows that both void formation and consumption of met-
allization and intermetallic compound occurred at the cath-
ode interface. The result agreed with the prediction of Eq.
(9) and Fig. 4, which show that JCu/JSn is close to 2 at
180 C. In other words, JCu and JSn are in the same order
of magnitude, so void formation and metallization con-
sumption are both important microstructure features in

The materials interactions on the under bump metallization (UBM) side of
flip-chip solder joints during current stressing were studied by using high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning trans-
mission electron microscopy (STEM). Flip-chip solder joints with sputtered
Al/Ni(V)/Cu UBM were subjected to current stressing at an ambient temperature
of 150C. It was found that a layer of Ni-Al phase, presumably NiAl3 according
to energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements, was observed at
the Al/Ni(V) interface. In addition, evidence for the formation of a noncon-
ductive oxide layer at the NiAl3/Ni(V) interface was observed. This noncon-
ductive oxide layer was responsible for diverting electron current away from
the porous region.

INTRODUCTION
Flip-chip technology has emerged as a main-
stream packaging scheme for modern electronics
owing to its high input/output density, excellent
performance, low cost, and straightforward assem-
bly.1,2 The Al/Ni(V)/Cu trilayer structure is one of
the most popular under bump metallurgy (UBM)
designs in modern flip-chip packages.1–9 During
assembly processes, solder joints undergo several
reflow cycles and the entire Cu layer in Al/Ni(V)/Cu
dissolves into the solder. A layer of Cu6Sn5 inter-
metallic compound (IMC) is simultaneously formed
between the exposed Ni(V) and the solder.1–4,8–10
Subsequently, the solder begins to react with Ni(V)
and the consumption of Ni(V) commences. Several
studies on the interfacial reactions between
Al/Ni(V)/Cu and solders have been reported in the
literature. Liu et al. investigated the interfacial
reaction between Al/Ni(V)/Cu and 5Sn-95Pb
(wt.%).11 A NixAly phase was observed between Al
and Ni(V).11 It was concluded that this NixAly phase
was likely to be NiAl3. Nevertheless, no accurate
composition analysis was carried out owing to the
limitations of the analysis technique (energy-
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, EDX, using scanning
electron microscopy, SEM).11 It was noted that the
shear strength significantly decreased after the
30th reflow, which was ascribed to the formation of
the AlxNiy compound.
11
Osenbach et al.3 reacted Al/Ni(V)/Cu with
eutectic Sn-Pb solder (Sn-37Pb) via solid-state aging
at 150C. They also observed evidence of the for-
mation of a Ni-Al compound that was likely to be
NiAl3.
3 Moreover, they observed that a strong
O signal occurred at the NiAl3/Ni(V) interface and
concluded that this was probably due to the forma-
tion of an oxide that acted as an electrically active
trap.3 The formation of this oxide would certainly
increase the resistance of the UBM and adversely
affect the electrical properties of the device.
In this study, it is reported that a Ni-Al compound
may also form during an electromigration test. A
conclusive method for the identification of the Ni-Al
compound has not been devised thus far; hence, one
objective of this study is to fully characterize the
Ni-Al phase formed during the reaction between
Al/Ni(V)/Cu and the solder by using high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

was detected at the location of the continuous layer
described in the previous paragraph. In addition, a
strong Al signal coincided with the Ni concentration
peak. These results were consistent with the
observation of Osenbach et al.3 The coinciding Ni
and Al signals suggest that the continuous layer
was most likely a Ni-Al compound. Figure 4a shows
a zoomed HAADF image, and Fig. 4b shows a line
scan of all the elements along the arrow indicated in
Fig. 4a. The dashed lines in the line scan profiles
separate the regions of Al, continuous layer, and
porous structure. The results show that the con-
tinuous layer was indeed composed of Al and Ni.
The maximum intensity of the O signal occurred, in
fact, next to this continuous layer. The composition
analysis of this continuous layer was carefully
performed using EDX. The composition was 74Al-
0V-21Ni-5Cu-0Sn (at.%). This composition confirms
the presumption that NiAl3 is the Ni-Al compound
present in the continuous layer. Neither V nor Sn
was detected. This result was similar to that of Li
et al.12
Figure 5a, b shows HRTEM images of this con-
tinuous layer. These HRTEM images show that the
continuous layer exhibited a crystalline structure
and was not amorphous. Insets in the lower-left
corners of Fig. 5a, b show Fourier-filtered images of
the continuous layer square regions shown in
Fig. 5a, b, respectively. Insets in the lower-right
corners of Fig. 5a, b show FFT patterns for the
corresponding Fourier-filtered images. On the basis
of the diffractogram measurements, it was con-
cluded that these crystalline regions belonged to the

and porous structure. (b) TEM DF image showing the same region

Oserbach et al. showed that a NiAl3 phase was
presumably formed between Al and Ni(V) in the
as-made bump.3 The fracture mode of devices with
Al/Ni(V)/Cu UBM and Sn-3.5Ag-1.0Cu or eutectic
Sn-Pb or 95Pb-5Sn solder has also been investi-
gated.1,4,11 After 20 reflow cycles at 260C for the
devices with Sn-3.5Ag-1.0Cu solder, most of the Ni(V)
was consumed and replaced by white patches (or Sn
patches), resulting in the brittle fracture mode. The
fracture location was at the original Al/Ni(V) inter-
face.4 After 20 reflow cycles at 220C for the devices
with eutectic Sn-Pb solder, most of the Ni(V) was still
intact, resulting in the ductile fracture mode. The
fracture location was inside the solder.1 After 30
reflow cycles at 350C for the devices with 95Pb-5Sn
solder, the Ni(V) layer remained intact; however, a
decrease in the shear strength was observed. The
fracture occurred at the Al/Ni(V) interface where an
AlxNiy compound was formed.
11 Summarizing these
results, it was realized that the formation of Ni-Al
IMC at an early stage during the reaction would not
influence the mechanical properties of the device.
Instead, the consumption of Ni(V) would be crucial. If
the Ni(V) layer remained intact during long-term
interfacial reactions, the formation of Ni-Al com-
pound would, in turn, significantly influence the
mechanical properties of the device.
The highest intensity of the O signal occurred
next to NiAl3, as shown in Figs. 3b and 4b. A metal
oxide has a lower mass density than the unoxidized
metal. It is known that material with lower mass
density appears with darker contrast in HAADF
images. The HAADF image in Fig. 4a shows many
small dark regions distributed next to the NiAl3
phase. These dark regions are probably voids or
oxides. If line scan analyses are performed across a
void, signal drops occur, as shown in Fig. 3. There
was no such signal drop; hence, the dark regions
could not be voids. Therefore, the dark regions most
likely represented oxides.
In the present study, the NiAl3 layer remains very
thin even after long-term reaction. The thickness is
around 25 nm, as shown in Fig. 5. The highest
intensity of the O signal is observed at the NiAl3/
porous structure interface. Ma et al. investigated
the formation mechanism of NiAl3 in Al/Ni thin-film
bilayers.15 Upon annealing, Ni penetrated along Al
grain boundaries. The solubility of Ni in Al is very
low; hence, the buried Ni in Al reacted with Al to
form NiAl3. Once a continuous NiAl3 layer was
established, the Ni flux across the NiAl3 layer should
became insignificant (only 1/30 of that of Al). In
addition, the oxygen in the Al layer or Ni layer slo-
wed down the growth of NiAl3. Therefore, both of
these factors contributed to a thin NiAl3 layer. They
also discussed the uniformity of the Al/NiAl3 inter-
face.15 The irregular Al/NiAl3 interface accounted
for the Al grain boundaries and the contamination at
the interface. As long as the growth rate of NiAl3 was
slow, a uniform layer-by-layer growth of NiAl3 was
observed. As compared with their study, the Ni layer
was replaced by Ni(V) in our study. The immobile V
in the Ni(V) layer acts as the contaminant that slows
down the NiAl3 growth rate. Besides, the chemical
potential gradient of Ni at the Al/Ni(V) interface is
assumed to be lower than that at the Al/Ni interface.
A lower gradient tends to contribute to the formation
of a uniform interface. Therefore, a uniform Al/Ni(V)
interface is observed in the present study.
CONCLUSIONS
Direct evidence of the formation of a Ni-Al com-
pound, most likely NiAl3, formed in sputtered
Al/Ni(V)/Cu UBM of flip-chip joint is reported based
on TEM BF, TEM DF, STEM-EDX, and HRTEM
analyses. A porous structure was formed, replacing
the original Ni(V) layer owing to the outdiffusion of
Ni and indiffusion of Cu and Sn. The STEM-EDX
line scan revealed almost no detectable Ni signal in
the porous structure. Evidence of the formation of
an oxide between NiAl3 and the porous structure
was also observed. This nonconductive oxide layer
was most likely the major factor in the diversion of
electron current away from the porous region.

module used in this study is shown schematically in Fig.
3a. The cooling system consists of brass cooling blocks, a
water reservoir bath, a tubing pump, and a temperature con-
trol electronic circuitry. The test chip was placed between the
cooling blocks, as shown in Fig. 3b. The sample tempera-
ture was measured by placing a ﬁne-gauge thermocouple on
the edge side of the chip at the location immediately next to
the Al line connecting the pair of solder joints under stress-
ing. The chips were placed inside oven set at 60 °C.
In order to compare the effect of the cooling system, a
separate set of experiment was carried out under the same
conditions but without using the cooling system.
After the current stressing, the ﬂip chip samples were
mounted in epoxy, and cross-sectioned through the middle of
the contact window in preparation for characterization. The
ﬂip chip solder joints were examined using scanning electron
microscopy. Furthermore, the compositions of the interme-
tallic compounds were determined by electron probe micro-
probe analysis EPMA.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Stressing without the cooling module
During current stressing without the cooling system, the
chip temperature rose above the ambient temperature 60 °C
rapidly, and the chip failed only after 10 min of stressing. At
failure, the thermocouple recorded a chip temperature as
high as 250 °C. It should be emphasized that the applied
current density of 4.5104 A /cm2 was substantially higher
than the values in all previous ﬂip chip electromigration
studies reported in the literature. As shown in Fig. 4, the chip
failed at the Al interconnect. The current density within the
Al interconnect was 4106 A /cm2. This value was in fact
well above the threshold current density for Al lines 1.6
105 A /cm2,1,19 and as a result Al line was susceptible to
failure by electromigration. In addition to the high current
density, the high temperature induced by Joule heating also
played a critical role in producing the rapid Al line failure.
As will be presented in the Sec. III B, the Al line would last
much longer if the cooling module was used.
Even though the chip failed in 10 min, interesting fea-
tures still developed within the solder joints. Figure 5 shows

electrons exited the solder joint. Figure 6e and 6f are the
zoom-in views of the substrate sides of Figs. 6a and 6b,
respectively. Even though Cu1−xNix6Sn5 formed on the sub-
strate sides of both joints, nevertheless the morphology of
Cu1−xNix6Sn5 were very different. In Fig. 6e, the
Cu1−xNix6Sn5 /Cu interface are planer but the
Cu1−xNix6Sn5 /Cu interface in Fig. 6f exhibited a zigzag
morphology. This zigzag morphology has been observed in
several of the specimens, and is not an artifact due to sample
preparation. It tends to occur when the current density is
high. The mechanism for the formation of this zigzag mor-
phology is unknown at this stage. Dedicated experiment is
underway to uncover the responsible mechanism.
It should be emphasized that the sample temperature in
this study was much lower than previous studies in literature
even though the applied current density was higher. Accord-
ingly, the microstructure features observed in Fig. 6 were
mainly due to the electromigration effect. If the sample tem-
perature had been higher, the microstructure features might
have been dominated by those generated from excessive in-
terfacial reaction. In addition, as the test chips were cooled
from the chip side as well as the substrate side see Fig. 3,
the temperature gradient across the solder joint was relatively
small. Consequently, thermomigration should not contribute
to substantial atom migration in this study.
From these results, it can be concluded that the use of
proper cooling during electromigration testing is not only
useful but also necessary. It is necessary because it could
decouple the sample temperature from the applied current
density. Without this decoupling, it is very difﬁcult to com-
pare results obtained from different studies. In addition, un-
der the condition of very high current density, the joint typi-
cally will fail very quickly due to excessive Joule heating.
Proper cooling has to be employed in order to have proper
period of stressing time for observation.
IV. SUMMARY
The cooling module used in this study successfully
maintained the sample temperature at the selected value de-
spite a large current passed through the test chip. This capa-
bility in temperature control provided a way to decouple the
applied current density and the sample temperature. Without
the cooling module, the sample temperature increased rap-
idly and failed in 10 min when the current density was 4.5
104 A /cm2. This rapid failure was caused by excessive
Joule heating. With the cooling module attached, the test
chip could survive much longer 935 h under the same cur-
rent density. This study demonstrates that, in future elec-
tromigration study, the use of proper cooling during elec-
tromigration testing is not only useful but also necessary, in
order to generate data that can be compared across different
laboratories.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The test chips had a daisy-chain circuit, and the
configuration of the solder joints is illustrated
schematically in Fig. 1. The Al trace on the chip was
60 lm wide and 1 lm thick. The UBM had a Cu/
Ni(V)/Al trilayer structure in which the sputter-
deposited Cu and Ni(V) layers were 0.8 lm and
0.3 lm thick, respectively. The V content in the
as-deposited Ni(V) layer was 7 at.%. The contact
window was 90 lm in diameter. On the substrate
side, the Au/Ni surface finish was used, and the
thicknesses of Au and Ni were 0.1 lm and 5 lm,
respectively. The solder was eutectic Sn-Pb and the
solder joint had a nominal diameter of 125 lm.
During electromigration testing, the samples
were kept at 150C and the applied current was
0.32 A. A nominal current density of 5 9 103 A/cm2
was determined based on the opening area of the
contact window. Focused ion beam milling was used
to fabricate the TEM specimens. Conventional
TEM, scanning TEM (STEM), and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) at an accelerating voltage of
200 kV were used to obtain bright-field (BF) images,
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line
scans, selected-area diffraction patterns (SADP),
and high-resolution image observations.
RESULTS
The FE-SEM observations of the consumed Ni(V)
and the porous structure have been reported
before6–8 and are omitted here. The Ni(V) UBM of
the as-reflowed solder joints had a crystalline
structure with long columns, as shown in Fig. 18 of
Ref. 15 and Fig. 1 of Ref. 16. In the following, con-
ventional TEM, STEM, and HRTEM characteriza-
tion of the consumed Ni(V) and porous structure
microstructures are presented.
TEM BF Observations
Figure 2a shows a TEM BF image of the con-
sumed Ni(V). It is clear that the consumed Ni(V)
forms a continuous layer. The interface between the
original Ni(V) layer and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 is blurred. This
is likely due to interdiffusion of the atomic species.
Figure 2b shows a TEM BF image of the porous
structure showing that there are many voids in the
Ni(V) layer. These voids are located near the inter-
face between the original Ni(V) layer and the
intermetallic compound (IMC). This observation
suggested that the fluxes of diffusing species were
not balanced in the nominal Ni(V) layer. There is a
void-free area in the Ni(V) layer near the Al side.
This result indicates the reason why the porous
structure exhibited a ‘‘two-phase structure’’ in FE-
SEM observation.7,8 The mottled components in the
FE-SEM images are actually voids according to
TEM images. The thicknesses of the consumed
Ni(V) and porous structure are around 300 nm,
identical to the as-deposited Ni(V) UBM.
STEM Line Scan Analyses
STEM EDX was employed to analyze the ele-
mental distribution in the consumed Ni(V) and the
porous structure. Figure 3a shows a high-angle
annular dark-field (HAADF) image of the consumed
Ni(V). The line scan results shown in Fig. 3b were

through the arrow in Fig. 4a. The average compo-
sition of the porous structure was 0.4 at.% Ni,
40.1 at.% V, 33.1 at.% Cu, 21.3 at.% Sn, and
5.1 at.% Al. The detected Al signal likely resulted
from the adjacent Al UBM layer, since the Al signal
of the line scan profile in the porous structure was
very weak. It was noted that almost no Ni signal
was detected in the porous structure. Only slight Ni
signals could be detected near the porous structure/
Al interface. The element V was still trapped in the
porous structure. The observation that V was
immobile and Ni diffused out from Ni-V alloys has
been reported in the literature.9–13,15–21
SADP Results
Figure 5a and b shows SADPs of consumed Ni(V),
and Fig. 5c and d shows those of porous structure.
They show a broad halo pattern and diffuse Debye
rings with some diffracted spots. Similar observa-
tions were reported in the literature, and the
reacted regions were called ‘‘Sn-patch.’’16,17 A broad
halo pattern and diffuse Debye rings are charac-
teristics of amorphous or fine-grain materials. The
diffraction spots revealed that there were some
crystalline domains in the consumed Ni(V) and
porous structure. The diffraction spots of the porous
structure appeared to be sharper than those of the
consumed Ni(V). This is likely due to crystallization
occurring during reaction. Based on the previous
STEM EDX analyses, the consumed Ni(V) or the
porous structure contained mainly V, Cu, and Sn.
Since there was no Cu-V compound, the diffracted
spots were attributed to Cu-Sn and/or V-Sn IMCs.
The diffuse diffraction spots were also used to cal-
culate d-spacings to identify the crystal structure
from JCPDS-ICDD cards. According to the mea-
surements of diffractograms of Fig. 5b and d and
Table I, the crystalline phases with fine grains in
consumed Ni(V) and porous structure corresponded
to Cu6Sn5 (no. 45-1488)
23 and VSn2 (no. 65-0948).
24
The VSn2 phase was named V2Sn3 in previous
studies.20,25 However, the nomenclature VSn2 was
used in more recent studies.21,26
HRTEM Results
To analyze the detailed microstructure of
the porous structure, HRTEM was performed.
Figure 6b, e, h, and k shows high-resolution images
of the porous structure taken from the region shown
in Fig. 6a. All these HRTEM images showed an
amorphous matrix with some crystalline domains.
These images agree well with the SADP results.
Figure 6c, f, i, and l shows Fourier-filtered images
obtained from the crystalline domains in respective
high-resolution images. Figure 6d, g, j, and m shows
fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns obtained
from the crystalline domains in respective high-
resolution images. According to the above evidence,
the crystalline domains shown in Fig. 6b and e were
Fig. 5. SADPs derived from (a, b) consumed Ni(V) and (c, d) porous
structure. The identification results of (b) and (d) show that the
crystalline phases in consumed Ni(V) and porous structure were
Cu6Sn5 and VSn2.

rearrangement after the out-diffusion of Cu atoms.
In our study a Ni(V) codeposit was first produced by
sputtering. Second, the EDX results shown in Fig. 3
indicated that out-diffusion of Ni occurred. Third, V
atoms were left behind and remained randomly
distributed without agglomeration after the out-
diffusion of Ni in our study. Finally, an amorphous
phase was present in the consumed Ni(V).
The Porous Structure and the Void Formation
The EDX and SADP results for the porous struc-
ture were similar to those for the consumed Ni(V).
The most obvious difference between the porous
structure and the consumed Ni(V) was the void
formation in the porous structure. Additionally, as
shown in the HAADF images of Figs. 3 and 4, there

The combined effect of solder volume and Cu concentration in solder on the Cu consumption rate is of
signiﬁcant practical importance but has never been satisfactorily addressed in literature so far. In this
study, lead-free solder balls of different volumes (400, 500, 760 and 960m in diameter) and different Cu
concentrations (Sn3AgxCuwith x=0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7wt.%)were reﬂowed over Cu soldering pads in order
to resolve this issue. The data obtained afforded the establishment of an empirical equation that could
predict the Cu consumption during reﬂow. Such consumption rate information is crucial for designing
the Cu conduction traces with minimum but reliable dimensions. Both the solder volume and the Cu
concentration had marked effects on the morphology of the reaction product. Rationalizations for the
effects on the consumption rate and the morphology are presented.

1. Introduction
The eutectic SnPb solder has been used over the past several
decades as a solderingmaterial for the interconnection andpackag-
ing applications in electronic products [1]. However, starting from
2007 its use in electronic products has beenbanned in theEuropean
Union due to the toxic effects of Pb element. The SnAgCu family
of solders and its higher-order derivatives are the most popular
lead-free replacement for eutectic SnPb [1–3].
In electronic packaging, excessive dissolution of the Cu layer of
under-bumpmetallizations (UBMs) or surface ﬁnishes into molten
solders during reﬂow is one of themost imperative processing con-
cerns [4]. An excessive dissolution of the Cu layer might result in
failures of devices. There are two factors that make the dissolu-
tion an even more pressing issue when eutectic SnPb is replaced
by SnAgCu. The ﬁrst factor is that the peak reﬂow temperature for
SnAgCu is at least 30 ◦C higher than that of eutectic SnPb because
of its higher liquidus temperature [5]. A higher reﬂow temperature
translates intomore extensivemetal dissolution during reﬂow. The
second factor is that SnAgCu is richer in Sn compared to eutectic
SnPb, and a higher Sn content leads to a faster metal dissolution
rate during reﬂow [6].
In the literature, many studies on the reaction between SnAgCu
solders and Cu have been published [7–22]. These studies showed
thatCu6Sn5 formedasa result of the reﬂow.TheCu3Sncompound is

formed between Cu6Sn5 and Cu onlywhen reacted at high temper-
atures for sufﬁcient periods of time. In these studies, efforts were
mainly placed on the identiﬁcations of the intermetallics and their
growth kinetics. However, the precise measurement of Cu con-
sumption is not emphasized. There are only a few studies on the
dissolution of the Cu layer of surface ﬁnishes [4,6,23–28]. It was
found that with a 0.5wt.% Cu addition in Sn3.5Ag, the Cu dissolu-
tion rate slowed down dramatically [6]. Nevertheless, the effect of
Cu addition was investigated only at a single concentration level,
and the effect of different amounts of Cu addition was not exam-
ined systematically. It was also found that the Cu dissolution rate
markedly increased with increasing molten solder temperature
[4,26,27]. These measurements were carried out by dipping thin
Cu wires into a very large amount of molten solder. As a result, the
Cu concentration in the solder barely increased as a result of Cu dis-
solution [4,26,27]. While such measurements provided important
fundamental data, the ratio of the solder volume to the Cu surface
area, however, deviated from the actual electronic solder joints by a
largedegree. In actual solder joints, the solder volumes are typically
very small, and the Cu concentration in the solder will change as
more andmore Cu atoms are dissolved into the solder. Accordingly,
the dissolution behavior changes with the changing concentration
of Cu in the solder. It was indeed conﬁrmed by Snugovsky et al.
[28] that the effect of solder volume could not be ignored. The
amount of copper dissolved was measured as a function of time
and temperature for the case of limited Sn volume [28].
The objective of this study is two-fold. Firstly, the effect of Cu
concentration on Cu dissolution behavior during reﬂowwill be sys-
tematically studied using several different levels of Cu addition into
Sn3Ag solder. Secondly, the effect of solder volume on the Cu disso-

microstructures after (a) one, (b) three, and (c)ﬁve reﬂows for theSn3Ag0.3Cu solder
balls.
The effect of the number of reﬂows on Cu6Sn5 is illustrated in
Fig. 3(a)–(c) for the case of 760mball and Sn3Ag0.3Cu solder. The
trends reported here were the same for the other ball sizes and the
other initial Cu compositions, and those results are omitted here for
brevity. As the number of reﬂow cycles increased from one to ﬁve,
the reactionproduct remained the scallop-typeCu6Sn5, but the size
of the scallops increased with increasing number of reﬂow cycles.
The average thickness of Cu6Sn5 also increasedwith the number of
reﬂow cycles.
The effect of the ball size on Cu6Sn5 is illustrated in Fig. 4(a)–(d)
for the case of Sn3Ag0.5Cu solder after one reﬂow. The trend
reported here was the same for the other ball compositions and
different numbers of reﬂow cycles. As the diameter of solder balls
decreased, the scallop size of Cu6Sn5 is also increased. The aver-
age thickness of the intermetallic compound at the interface also
increased upon decreasing the ball diameter.
Summarizing the results in the preceding three paragraphs, one
notes that the Cu6Sn5 scallop size increased upon increasing the
initial Cu concentration in solders (Fig. 2), with the increasing num-
ber of reﬂow cycles (Fig. 3), andwith the decreasing solder ball size
(Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the average thickness of Cu6Sn5 at the inter-
face only depended strongly on the number of reﬂowcycles and the

ball size, but the average thickness of Cu6Sn5 lacked a clear depen-
dency on the initial Cu concentration in solder, as shown in Fig. 5(a)
and (b). In other words, the initial Cu concentration in solder did
have a clear effect on the scallop size, but lacked a strong inﬂuence
on the average thickness of Cu6Sn5.We also observed that the aver-
age thickness of Cu6Sn5 after the ﬁrst reﬂow was larger than the
subsequent reﬂows.
In forming those Cu6Sn5 scallops, different amounts of the Cu
were consumed from the Cu pad under different conditions. As

represent the density of SnAgCu solder, Cu6Sn5, and Cu, respec-
tively; TIMC and TCu represent the thickness of Cu6Sn5 formed at
the interface and the consumed Cu pad thickness, respectively.
The densities of Sn3Ag(0–0.7)Cu, Cu6Sn5, and Cu can be taken as
7.4, 8.28, and 8.96g/cm3, respectively [29]. The value of wCu/IMC
is 39.1wt.% according to the Cu6Sn5 formula. With these material
properties applied to Eq. (1), one obtains the apparent Cu concen-
tration in solder as
wCu = w0Cu +
(
182
d2pad
d3joint
)
(TCu − 0.36TIMC) [wt.%] (2)
To use this equation, the diameters and the thicknesses must
have the same dimension.
Since TCu and TIMC are available in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a), respec-
tively, wCu consequently can be calculated by using Eq. (2). The
values ofwCu are plotted in Fig. 7 for the case of 760msolder balls.
As shown in Fig. 7, after one reﬂow, the apparent Cu concentration
reaches 1.2wt.% regardless of different initial Cu concentrations.
Additional reﬂow cycles only raised the apparent Cu concentra-
tion very slightly. According to Moon et al. [30], the Cu solubility
in Sn3Ag at 235 ◦C was 1.2wt.%. In other words, the 760m solder
joints reached Cu saturation in just one reﬂow regardless of what
the initial Cu concentration was in solders. Nevertheless, The Cu
solubility is a function of temperature [28]. Accordingly, the wCu is
also a function of temperature, and, to a ﬁrst approximation, can
be read from the Cu–Sn binary phase diagram. This explains why
additional reﬂow cycles did not dissolve substantiallymore Cu pad.
A comparison among Figs. 5(a), 6(a), and 7 for a given number of
reﬂow provides additional insights. For a given number of reﬂow
cycles, the thickness of Cu6Sn5 (Fig. 5(a)) did not vary toomuch for
different types of solders, but the consumed Cu thickness (Fig. 6(a))
was quite different for different solders. Interestingly, the apparent
Cu concentration for different solders again converged into a very
narrow range of values (Fig. 7). This suggests that the difference
in consumed Cu thickness among the different solders could be
attributed to the different amounts of Cu atoms needed in order to
raise the Cu concentrations from the initial Cu concentrations to
the same apparent Cu concentration.
With theCu concentration effect clariﬁed,we are now in abetter
position to examine the experimental results of this study.
4.1. Effect of initial Cu concentration
An increase in the initial Cu concentrationproduced twomarked
effects during reﬂow: (1) the size of the Cu6Sn5 scallops increased,
as shown in Fig. 2, and (2) the consumption of the Cupaddecreased,
as shown in Fig. 6(a). The ﬁrst effect was probably due to the
decreased Cu6Sn5 nucleation rate with increasing initial Cu con-
centration. As the initial Cu concentration increased from 0 to
0.7wt.%, the Cu concentration gradient between Cu and solder
decreased. This concentration gradient was related to the driv-
ing force for nucleation and, according to the classical nucleation
theory, a smaller driving force for nucleation corresponded to a
reduced nucleation rate. As less Cu6Sn5 is nucleated, these Cu6Sn5
scallops did nucleate then could grow larger.
The rationalization for the second effect has beenpresentedpre-
viously. In short, the decrease in Cu dissolution with increasing the
initial Cu concentration was attributed to different amounts of Cu
atomsneeded inorder to raise theCuconcentrations fromthe initial
values to the same ﬁnal apparent Cu concentration.
4.2. Effect of number of reﬂow
An increase in the number of reﬂow also increased the scallop
size, as shown in Fig. 3. Kim et al. reported that the scallop size
increased with the reaction time when the eutectic PbSn solder
was reacted with Cu at 200 ◦C, and proposed that the increase in
size was due to Ostwald ripening [31]. In this study, as the number
of reﬂowis increased, the time that themolten solderwas in contact
with the Cu is also increased. Therefore, it was very likely that the
increase in scallop size here was also due to ripening.
In the literature, it was reported that the dissolution of thin Cu
wire into a large amount of solder followed the linear kinetics [4].
In our study, the ﬁrst reﬂowconsumed themost Cu, but subsequent
reﬂows only consumed marginally more Cu, as shown in Fig. 6(a).
The difference between these two studies can be explained as fol-
lows. In the previous study [4], the solder was always far from
reaching the saturation limit, because the amount of solder was
large. In our study, the solder reached the Cu saturation limit dur-
ing the ﬁrst or second reﬂow, and after the saturation was reached
additional reﬂows did not dissolve substantially more Cu.
The results discussed in this section can be understood by
the theoretical framework developed by Dybkov [32–34]. In this
model, both the chemical reaction and dissolution are taken into
account, and mathematical equations were derived to describe
the growth of an intermetallic layer under both saturated and
under-saturated conditions. This theoretical description developed
by Dybkov [32–34] in fact can qualitatively explain every fea-
ture observed in this study. Unfortunately, the reﬂow temperature
proﬁle used in our study was not a constant temperature one,
but a non-constant temperature proﬁle commonly employed by
industry. Accordingly, a quantitative model ﬁtting of our data to
this model is not possible. Nevertheless, Dybkov’s theory correctly
captured all the essential features of real systems, and provided
an excellent backdrop for our understanding of systems like the
present one.
4.3. Effect of solder volume
As shown in Fig. 4, a decrease in the solder volume favored the
formation of larger Cu6Sn5 scallops. This was because, for smaller
solder balls, the Cu concentration in the solder rose faster than the
larger ones. As the smaller balls experienced the effect of higher Cu
concentrations for longer periods of time, the scallops grew larger
due to the Cu concentration effect discussed in Section 4.1.
As shown in Fig. 6, there was a trend that the consumed Cu
thickness decreased with decreasing the solder ball diameter. This
was because a smaller solder joint and a larger one had about the
same apparent Cu concentration (Fig. 7), and a smaller solder joint,
therefore, consumed less Cu in order to reach the apparent Cu con-
centration.

When the Sn concentration became 3wt.%, a thin intermetallic
layer formed at the interface after 2min, as shown in Fig. 2(a), but
its thickness was too thin to be accurately analyzed with FE-EPMA.
From the results at longer reaction time, it was presumed to be

Ni3Sn2 formed, andNi3Snwasnotobserved. Therewereagainvoids
and high-Pb phase (Pb) between Ni3Sn and Ni, but the amount of
voids and high-Pb phase (Pb) were less than those of 95Pb5Sn and
97Pb3Sn. In fact, a trend can be observed in Figs. 1(c), 2(c), and 3
that the amount of voids (Pb) decreased with decreasing Sn con-
centration in solders.
4. Discussion
During the soldering reaction, the Sn atoms in solder reacted
with Ni to form Ni–Sn intermetallics at the interface. If the amount
of solder had been small, as in ﬂip–chip solder joints, the Sn con-
centration in solder would have decreased as Ni–Sn intermetallics
grew thicker. Nevertheless, in this study, the amount of solder was
purposely set to be very large (12g) compared to the amount of
Ni–Sn intermetallics formed at the interface. Consequently, the Sn
concentration in solder stayed nearly constant. This was done so
that the Sn concentration effect can be clariﬁed in this study ﬁrst.
Only after establishing the concentration effect, could one begin to
investigate the volume effect. However, it should be emphasized
that the results obtained in this study should only be used to inter-
pret to results in real ﬂip chip joints with an understanding of the
volume effect.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
A schematic drawing of the ﬂip-chip structure
used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. On the chip
side, an outer under bump metallization (UBM)
layer composed of 3 lm of Ni was in direct contact
with a 95Pb-5Sn solder bump. The 95Pb-5Sn solder
was electroplated onto the Ni layer and then
reﬂowed at 350C to form a spherical bump with a
nominal diameter of 95 lm.
The top metal layer on the soldering pads was
electroplated Cu. The pre-solder was screen-printed
over this Cu layer. The mass ratio of the 95Pb-5Sn
solder in the solder bump relative to the 37Pb-63Sn
content in the screen-printed solder paste was 16:5.
In this mass ratio, these two solders, when com-
pletely mixed, would from in an alloy with an
overall composition of 81Pb-19Sn.
The ﬂip-chip assembly in this study was reﬂowed
between one and ten times. The reﬂow during
which the 37Pb-63Sn solder paste ﬁrst became
molten and the substrate was bonded to the chip
was considered the ﬁrst reﬂow. The reﬂow used to
form the 95Pb-5Sn solder bump was not counted.
Each reﬂow lasted 115 s, during which time the
solder was molten and the peak reﬂow temperature
was 240 ± 2C. The nominal ramp and cooling rates
were both 1.5C/s.
The ﬁrst reﬂow was monitored by a stereo optical
microscope to establish the melting process. After
soldering was completed, the solder joints were
mounted in epoxy and metallographically polished
to reveal the interface and the internal microstruc-
ture. Image analysis software was used to measure
the thickness of the layer of intermetallic com-
pounds. The thickness of each layer was deﬁned as
the total area occupied by the intermetallic com-
pound divided by the linear length of the interface.
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to
examine the reaction zone for each solder joint,
and a state-of-the-art ﬁeld-emission electron probe
microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-8500F,
Tokyo, Japan) operated at 12 keV was used to
identify the composition of the reaction products.
During the microprobe measurement, Ka, La, and La
x-rays were detected for Cu, Ag, and Sn, respec-
tively. In the microprobe analysis, the concentra-
tions of each of these elements were measured
independently, and the total weight percentage was
within 100 ± 1 wt.% in each case. For every data
point, at least four measurements were made, and
the average value is reported.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In Situ Reﬂow Observation
Figure 2 shows the sequence of events during the
ﬁrst reﬂow, observed through a stereo microscope.
The temperature and the time are shown at the
upper-left and upper-right corners, respectively.
The sample temperature was 31C when the reﬂow
started, as shown in Fig. 2a. The bright spheres
represent the 95Pb-5Sn solder bumps, and the dark
regions immediately below the spheres represent
the 37Pb-63Sn solder paste. Figure 2b shows the
microstructure 1 s before the solder paste began to
melt; the temperature at this point was 181C.
Figure 2c shows the exact moment when the tem-
perature reached the eutectic point and when the
solder paste started to melt. Because the solidus
temperature of the high-lead solder bump was
higher, the solder bump remained solid. As the
solder paste became molten, its color changed
from a dark color to that of shiny liquid metal. After
another second, the molten 37Pb-63Sn was dis-
placed slightly to the side of the solid bumps, the
standoff (i.e., the vertical distance between the
chip and substrate) decreased, and the molten
37Pb-63Sn climbed up the side of the solder-bump
spheres, as shown in Fig. 2d. The temperature at
this point was 185C. When the peak reﬂow tem-
perature was reached, the molten 37Pb-63Sn clim-
bed even higher up the side of the solder-bump
spheres, as shown in Fig. 2e. When the reﬂow
ended, the standoff was the same as that at the peak
reﬂow temperature, as shown in Fig. 2f.
Closer examination of the solidiﬁed solder joints
revealed that the height to which the 37Pb-63Sn
solder ascended along the 95Pb-5Sn solder bump
sphere was uneven. Figure 3 shows that the shape
of the solidiﬁed 37Pb-63Sn solder was similar to
that of a calyx (i.e., a cup-like structure) wrapped
around the high-lead solder bump sphere.
Cross-Sectional Observation
In this study, the ﬂip-chip assembly had 45 solder
bumps for the ﬁrst outer row of solder joints. The
cross-sectional microstructures from the ﬁrst outer

over a 37Pb-63Sn pre-solder before assembly. Under the situation
that the 95Pb-5Sn in the solder bump and the 37Pb-63Sn content in
the printed solder paste are completely mixed, the overall composi-
tion will be 81Pb-19Sn.

but they were skewed to the right. The schematic
drawing shown in Fig. 5 helps clarify the difference
in joint shapes. The solder bumps were perfectly
aligned with the pre-solder on the substrate before
reﬂow, as shown in Fig. 5a. During reﬂow, as
the oven temperature increased, the chip and the
substrate expanded. The difference in the coefﬁcient
of thermal expansion between the silicon chip
(a = 2.6 ppm/C) and the chip-carrier substrate
(a = 15 ppm/C) caused the substrate to expand
more than the chip. Consequently, the soldering
pads on the chip side became misaligned with the
substrate, as shown in Fig. 5b. When the oven
temperature rose beyond the eutectic temperature,
the solder paste melted and climbed up along the
high-lead solder bump, as shown in Fig. 5c. During
the cooling stage, the molten solder solidiﬁed, and
the substrate contracted and slightly deformed the
solder joints. These processes resulted in the ﬁnal
joint shapes shown in Fig. 5d.

the middle row after one to ten reﬂows. The result
shows that the middle row of the chip and the ﬁrst
outer row of the chip have a similar microstructure,
indicating that the thermal history near the center
of the packages was not very different from that
near the edges of the packages.
As the number of reﬂows increased, gaps between
the UBM and the solder developed in some of the
solder joints, as shown in Fig. 4m and p. Magniﬁed
views of these gaps are shown in Fig. 7. This phe-
nomenon was attributed to the dewetting caused by
the molten 37Pb-63Sn, which climbed high enough
to reach the chip side, as illustrated schematically
in Fig. 8. After the ﬁrst reﬂow, the molten solder
only reached about half the height of the high-lead
solder bump, as illustrated in Fig. 8a. As the num-
ber of reﬂows increased, the tip of the molten solder
climbed continuously higher and eventually reached
the UBM/solder interface, as illustrated in Fig. 8b.
As the number of reﬂows continued to increase, the
molten solder penetrated into the interface between
the UBM and 95Pb-5Sn, as illustrated in Fig. 8c.
During the cooling stage, the molten solder solidi-
ﬁed, which was accompanied by a volume contrac-
tion. Because the bulk of the heat was drawn away
from the substrate side, the molten solder solidiﬁed
near the substrate side ﬁrst. The last remaining
molten solder was the solder near the UBM. The
volume contraction occurred at the location of
the last remaining molten solder (i.e., the tip of the
calyx near the chip side), causing the formation
of the gaps shown in Fig. 7. The formation of
these gaps caused serious reliability concerns
because the tip of the gap can serve as a site for the

CONCLUSIONS
This study investigated the intermixing of
95Pb-5Sn solder bumps and 37Pb-63Sn pre-solder
in ﬂip-chip solder joints. During reﬂow, the molten
pre-solder had a shape that was irregular and
similar to a calyx wrapped around a high-lead
solder bump. The shapes of the solder joints at the
left, central, and right sides of the chip were dif-
ferent because of the difference in the coefﬁcient of
thermal expansion between the silicon chip and
the chip-carrier substrate. The height to which the
molten pre-solder climbed along the solid high-lead
solder bump increased with increasing number of
reﬂows. The molten pre-solder was able to reach
the UBM/95Pb-5Sn interface after three to ﬁve
reﬂows. The molten pre-solder at the UBM/95Pb-5Sn
interface generated the following two important
phenomena:
(1) The molten solder dewetted along the UBM/
95Pb-5Sn interface, particularly when the num-
ber of reﬂows was high. This dewetting was
considered to be a result of volume shrinkage
during the solder solidiﬁcation stage.
(2) The molten pre-solder transported Cu atoms to
the UBM/95Pb-5Sn interface. When enough Cu
atoms reached the UBM/95Pb-5Sn interface, the
compound at the interface changed from Ni-Sn
to (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5.

Fundamental Study of the Intermixing of 95Pb-5Sn High-Lead Solder Bumps and 37Pb-63Sn Pre-Solder
on Chip-Carrier Substrates

thicknesses, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 lm, were used. On the
substrate side, the Au/Ni surface ﬁnish was used,
and the surface ﬁnish had 0.1 lm Au and 5 lm Ni.
The solder was 63Sn-37Pb eutectic solder, and the
solder joints had a nominal diameter of 125 lm.
During the electromigration test, the assembled
chips and substrates were kept in an oven set at
150C. A constant 0.32 A current was passed
through the solder joints, producing a nominal
current density of 5 · 103 A/cm2 (based on the
opening area of the contact window). Resistance
changes were monitored every 10 s during the cur-
rent stressing, and the failure time was determined
by an abrupt potential increase in the potential–
time curve. Each value of the MTTF was deter-
mined based on 22 test samples.
After different periods of current stressing time,
some of the solder joints were cross-sectioned
through the middle of the contact window, and
examined using a ﬁled-emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM). Furthermore, the composi-
tions of the intermetallic compounds were deter-
mined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).
The distribution of the current density in a solder
joint, including the UBM, was simulated by a ﬁnite-
element model. The parameters used in simulation
are summarized in Table I. In this study, we
focused the simulation on the location where the
current crowding was the highest, i.e., the entrance
of electrons from the Al interconnects into the joints.
RESULTS
Figure 2 shows Weibull plots of the samples
with different Ni UBM thicknesses. The MTTF of
the solder joints were determined to be 384, 736,
and 1,269 h for the 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 lm Ni thick-
nesses, respectively. The MTTF values reported
here are based on 22 samples for each Ni thick-
ness. The MTTF results clearly show that a
thicker Ni UBM had a longer lifetime. It is very
surprising that the Ni UBM thickness alone was
able to produce such a huge performance gain even
though everything else was kept the same. In the
following, the results from the microstructure
examination at different periods of current stress-
ing are presented to gain insight into the failure
mechanism and to understand this strong effect of
UBM thickness.
Microstructure Evolution under Electromi-
gration
Figure 3 shows the typical microstructures of the
solder joints with 0.3 lm Ni that had went through
different stages of current stressing. The 0.8 lm Cu
layer in the Cu/Ni/Al UBM had been completely
consumed and was converted into Cu6Sn5 during the
assembly of the joint, as had been reported in our
previous studies.15,16 The Au layer of the Au/Ni
surface ﬁnish had also been replaced by a (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5 layer after assembly.
15,16 The coarsening
of the Pb-Sn eutectic structure with time can be seen
in Fig. 3a–c. Figure 4a–c are higher-magniﬁcation
micrographs of Fig. 3a–c, respectively, showing the
interfaces near the UBM. After 150 h of current
stressing, as shown in Fig. 4a, the Cu6Sn5 near the
upper-right corner of the joint had become (Cu1-xNix)6
Sn5, but elsewhere on the chip side no Ni could be
detected inside the Cu6Sn5. After 300 h of current
stressing, as shown in Fig. 4b, all the Cu6Sn5 had
become (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5. Meanwhile, a continuous
layer of the Pb-rich phase accumulated on the sub-
strate side of the joint, as shown in Fig. 3b. This
showed that Pb was the main migration species.
This result is expected because at 150C Pb diffuses
faster than Sn.17 After 400 h of current stressing, as

Ni UBM Consumption and the Porous
Structure
Figure 4a shows that only the part of the Ni UBM
near the entrance for the electrons had been con-
sumed. Meanwhile, the Ni UBM at other location
was still intact. No Ni could be detected in this
Cu6Sn5 beneath the intact Ni UBM. When the
stressing time reached 300 h, all the Ni UBM had
been completely consumed and Ni could be detected
in all the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5, as shown in Fig. 4b. The
simultaneous disappearance of the Ni layer and the
appearance of Ni in the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 suggests
that the dissolution of Ni into Cu6Sn5 was the main
consumption mechanism for the Ni layer. At this
stage, the so-called porous structure15,16 was limited
to the right-hand side of the UBM, but after 400 h of
current stressing, as shown in Fig. 4c, the porous
structure had extended across the entire UBM.
Shown in Fig. 5a–c are the higher-magniﬁcation
micrographs for the A, B, and C regions in Fig. 4,
respectively. It is clearly visible that the Ni UBM
consumption initiated at the upper-right corner, as
shown in Fig. 5a. No void formed at the interface.
Figure 5b shows that the Ni UBM had been com-
pleted replaced by the porous structure. The leading
edge of the porous structure is shown in Fig. 5c.
Summarizing the features in Fig. 5a–c, one notes
that the Ni consumption and the formation of the
porous structure was a sequence of events that ini-
tiated at the right-hand side and extended to the left
under current stressing.
DISCUSSION
The Effect of Current Crowding and Joule
Heating
It had been reported that current crowding effect
plays an important role in the reliability of ﬂip-chip
solder joints under electromigration.1–7,10,11,13 In
order to understand the degree of current crowding,
a three-dimensional ﬁnite-element simulation was
used to calculate the current density distribution of
the joint. Figure 6a shows the mesh geometry used
in this study. Figure 6b–d shows the simulated
current density distribution for 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 lm
Ni UBM joints, respectively. Although the average
current density was 5 · 103 A/cm2 based on the neck
of the contact window, the simulation shows that
the highest current density in Fig. 6b–d can be as
high as 6.3 · 105, 6.1 · 105, and 4.4 · 105 A/cm2,
respectively. The peak current density decreased
from 6.3 · 105 to 4.4 · 105 as the Ni UBM thickness
increased from 0.3 lm to 0.8 lm. This was because
thicker UBM could effectively spread out the pass-
ing electrons. The results in Fig. 6b–d show that the
peak current density here was 100 times higher
than that of the average current density. This
extreme local current density would cause an
excessive local Joule heating, which in turn caused
a higher local temperature at the Ni UBM. This
high local temperature combined with the high local
electromigration, which was caused by the high
local current density, accelerated the local interfa-
cial reaction and diffusion between the solder and
the Ni UBM layer. Consequently, the Ni UBM
consumption rate would be faster near the high-
current-density region.
In this study, local accelerated Ni consumption
was indeed observed, as shown in Fig. 5a. It was
clearly visible that the local Ni UBM near the en-
trance of electrons had been exhausted and replaced
by the intermetallic compound. This suggested that
the thin Ni layer was locally consumed before the
formation of the voids near the region with the peak
current density.
The porous structure observed in this study is
similar in appearance to the porous structure
observed in the reaction between the phased-in

介面反應的領域中占有非常重要的地位。 
二、與會心得 
這次是學生第一次參與國際性的材料研討會的口頭報告，在報告前多少會有些緊張，所幸就
報告內容而言個人認為算是一次成功的報告，且對於國外學術討論的風氣印象非常深刻，尤其有
些學者即使沒有特別的疑問，亦會給講者非常受用的建議，在國內就本人參與過的會議來看是很
少見到的。除了學生本人之外，本實驗室有另外四人也有發表口頭報告，主題包括介面反應的 TEM
分析、高鉛焊料的特殊介面反應、焊料溶鎳對介金屬生長之影響以及介金屬大規模剝離之熱力學
探討。學生認為本實驗室的口頭報告相較於其他實驗室內容呈現的不錯，主要歸功於出國前與指
導教授多次的討論與演講練習。 
此外，此次參與國際會議也認識數個國外研究生，其中一位還是台灣大學機械系畢業的學長，他
曾是台大應力所舒貽忠教授的專題研究生，目前於華盛頓大學進行 thin film 形貌模擬的研究。雖
然未能深談，但仍互相留下聯絡方式，以期未來能有機會彼此討論與雙方所長相關的領域。除了
發表研究報告外，認識國外留學生也是非常有意義且難得的經驗。對於學生能順利出席大型國際
會議，除了感謝指導教授的支持外，也特別感謝國科會在經費上的補助。 
三、建議 
此行為學生第一次參加國際大型會議，因此對國內外研討會之差異之印象格外深刻。雖然 TMS 
Annual meeting 確實能吸引各國頂尖研究團隊參與研討會，但學生認為差異最大之處不在於研討會
本身，而是海報展覽的氣氛。TMS Annual meeting 的海報展覽一向不是其重心或主軸，規模不僅不
及 MRS，甚至也沒有台灣的材料年會來得大。但是與會者與海報作者討論之程度卻遠遠超過台灣
的材料年會，甚至還會出現同一群人與作者討論近一小時的盛況。在這次的展覽過程中，學生也
見識到中國學生確實比台灣學生來得積極，這也是國內學生應努力改善的方向。 
另外，學生也發現除了無鉛焊料與介面反應領域，很少發現有台灣的研究團隊參與 TMS Annual 
meeting。學生認為非常可惜，TMS Annual Meeting 在美國相當於國內的材料年會，甚至大非常多，
參與者包括許多學術界及業界著名人士。而台灣材料界在各領域亦有許多頂尖的研究團隊與學者，
但是參與的程度並不是非常踴躍。未來期待能有更多台灣的研究團隊將他們的研究成果在國際舞
台上呈現。
