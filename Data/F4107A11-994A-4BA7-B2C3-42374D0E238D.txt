The rapid growth of modern data-acquisition technology uses during production has
made it common to monitor several correlated quality characteristics simultaneously. As a
result, various types of multivariate control charts have been proposed for statistical process
control works. A natural multivariate extension to the univariate Shewhart chart is the
Hotelling’s multivariate control procedure (1947). For this procedure, it is assumed that a
sequence of )1( p random vectors 321 XXX ,, , each representing individual observation or
sample mean vector of p related quality characteristics, are observed over time. The p
related quality characteristics are assumed jointly distributed as p-variate normal with mean
vector 0μ and covariance matrix 0Σ . When iX ’s represent the independent sample mean
vectors with sample size of n , the Hotelling’s multivariate control chart signals that a
process mean shift has occurred as soon as knT iii   )()'( 12 XXSXX , where X and S are

Recently multivariate CUSUM and multivariate EWMA schemes (Crosier, 1988;
Lowry et al., 1992) have been proposed and shown better powerful than 2T control chart
particularly for small or moderate process shifts. In order to increase the power of the
original 2T control chart, He and Grigoryan (2005) proposed the multivariate multiple
sampling (MMS) control chart scheme, which is a multivariate extension of a double
sampling (DS) X chart with least two sampling stages. The assumption of MMS or DS
charts is that the minimum time between successive samples is negligible. The DS X
chart was proposed by Daudin (1992) to improve the statistical efficiency of the X chart
without increased sampling. Daudin’s work has also been successfully extended to
monitoring of process variability (Grigoryan and He, 2005) as well as joint monitoring of
process mean and variability (He and Grigoryan, 2006).
On the other hand, Aparisi extended the ideas of adaptive sample size, sampling interval,
and control limits in the univariate case (e.g., Reynolds et al., 1988; Tagaras, 1998; Prabhu et
al., 1994; Costa, 1997) to the multivariate case, and proposed three types of modified 2T
charts with variable sample size (VSS), variable sampling interval (VSI), and variable
sample size and sampling interval (VSSI) features respectively (see Aparisi, 1996; Aparisi
and Haro, 2001; Aparisi and Haro, 2003), given that the 0μ and 0Σ were known. In
contrast to the MMS or DS charts, the assumption of VSS, VSI, and VSSI charts is that the
minimum time between successive samples is positive (He et al., 2002). The study results
indicate that the VSI 2T charts obtain a great improvement in the value of average time to
signal ( ATS ) for moderate process shifts while the VSSI 2T charts obtain a great
improvement for small process shifts. As compared with the MMS chart with two sampling
stages, the VSSI 2T chart is better in detecting small shifts in the process mean vector.
Although the MMS chart with multiple sampling stages ( 3 ) begins to give a better
performance than the VSSI 2T chart, it might become more difficult to work with the MMS
chart in industrial practice.
Chen and Chiou (2005) considered that 0μ and 0Σ are unknown and extended
Aparisi’s works to the fully variable parameters (VP) 2T charts, which allow the sample
size, the sampling interval and the control limit changeable simultaneously. From
numerical comparisons, it indicates that for small process shifts the VP 2T charts provide
better ATS values than the VSSI charts, remaining the ATS values almost the same for
moderate process shifts.
Although the adaptive 2T charts have been shown to be quicker than Hotelling’s 2T
charts with fixed sampling rate (FSR) in detecting small or moderate shifts for a process, the
adaptive sampling schemes for the VSI, VSSI, and VP 2T charts use two sampling intervals
(the short and long intervals) in which the sampling times in a given time period will be
unpredictable and cause administrative inconvenience. Consequently, this study proposes the

2 jj n , where  is the Mahalanobis distance used to measure a change in the process
mean vector.
Let 1iN be the number of subsequent sample points from the current sample point (i)
until another sample point outside the warning region, given that the current sample point
belongs to the safe region. The 1iN ’s are independent and identically distributed with

when the first sample is large, the total number of sample points from the start of the process

結果與討論
Comparing the VSSC and FSR 2T charts
The comparisons between the VSSC and FSR charts were conducted for the situations
in which two or four related quality characteristics were simultaneous control. Tables 1 and 2
illustrate the values of 1n , 2n , 1w , 2w , 1 ( 1k ), and 2 ( 2k ) that minimize 1ATS by fixing 0h
at 1.00 and 0 at 0.005 when different degrees of the process mean shifts (): 0.25, 0.50,
0.75, 1.00, 1.25, and 1.50 are present. To make a rational choice of m , we began with
picking a value from the range of )1(3/800 0 np to )1/(400 0 np in Nedumaran and Pignatiello
(1999) for different combinations of p and 0n . The range was speculated so that the 2T
charts based on the estimated parameters can perform in a similar manner to the charts based
on true parameters during the on-line process monitoring stage. After that, a sensitivity
analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of m values on the optimal design
parameters and ATS.
As compared with the FSR 2T chart, the improvements (%) in the 1ATS :
100/)(  FSRVSSCFSR ATSATSATS , using the VSSC control schemes are great especially for small
( 00.1 ) process mean shifts. This means a shorter time to detect an out-of-control condition.
Sometimes, when the average sample size is large with large process shift ( 50.1 ), the
improvement are minor. It may be observed that the space between the maximum and
minimum control limits tends to be narrow as the magnitude of shift in the process increases.
Identical outcomes are found for the variable warning limits the sample sizes.
A sensitivity analysis, which measures the effect of m values on the optimal design
parameters and 1ATS values, has been studied. It is found that, from the result of sensitivity
analysis, only the maximum action and warning limits are sensitive to m values. Figure 2
shows their values against different m values for the cases of 2p , 40 n , and =0.25,
0.50, 1.00, or 1.50. As shown in Figure 1, the maximum control or warning limit is
decreasing as the m value initially increases. But, it remains almost unvarying as long as m
goes beyond Nedumaran and Pignatiello’s lower bound: )1(3/800 0 np .
Comparisons with the VSI, VSS, VSSI and VP 2T charts
Tables 3-6 give the results of comparisons among the VSSC, VP, VSSI,VSS, VSI, and
FSR 2T charts for two and four related quality characteristics in the cases of 0n =2 or 4, and
the values of  increased from 0.25 to 1.50 by 0.25. From these tables, it is observed that
for very small  values the VSSC chart is superior to the VSSI, VSS, VSI and FSR charts.
Moreover, the VSSC and VP chart result in similar performances of out-of-control ATS
values. However, from the viewpoint of administration, the VSSC chart which always takes
a sample at fixed times are more convenient than the VP chart. As a result, it can be
concluded that the VSSC chart is a good option to quickly detect a small magnitude of
process shift. For large process shifts ( 1 ), the VSSC scheme is a trivial improvement on
the FSR scheme in comparison with the VSSI, VSI, and VP schemes. But, this must not
cause a fuss because for large shifts the values of ATS by themselves are already fairly
small.
