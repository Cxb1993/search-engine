Abstract 
This project is devoted to the study of 
employing improved half-wavelength (λ/2) 
tri-section stepped-impedance resonators 
(TSSIRs) and combined quarter-wavelength 
(λ/4) SIRs and TSSIRs to design 
ultra-wideband bandpass filters (UWB BPFs). 
The designed UWB BPFs will finally be 
implemented on planar substrates and be 
measured and verified. The idea for the UWB 
BPF design proposed in this project is to 
have the first several resonant modes of the 
TSSIR, SIR, or their combined structures 
located in the desired UWB band (3.1 
GHz-10.6 GHz) to obtain a broad band 
response. Then the techniques of 
implementing coupled lines, cross-coupled 
structures, and open stubs are employed to 
improve the overall frequency response. The 
proposed research work includes 
higher-order harmonics suppressed UWB 
BPFs, band-notched UWB BPFs, and 
multiband orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB BPFs. 
Keywords: stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) 
tri-section SIR (TSSIR), ultra-wideband 
bandpass filter (UWB BPF), cross-coupled 
configuration, transmission zero, insertion 
loss. 
1. Introduction 
Ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filters 
(BPFs) are very important building blocks in 
UWB systems that are suitable for high 
data-rate, short-distance communications. In 
the past few years, many UWB BPFs have 
been proposed [1-5]. Some were implemented 
using microstrip structures [1-4], and some 
using hybrid microstrip and coplanar- 
waveguide (CPW) structures [5]. In all these 
structures, tightly coupled constructions are 
usually needed at the input/output ports. In 
addition, the so-called multi-mode resonator 
(MMR) that can support multiple resonant 
modes inside the UWB passband has been 
widely employed in the UBW BPF design [1]  
In this project, UWB BPFs designed 
employing improved half-wavelength (λ/2) 
tri-section stepped-impedance resonators 
(TSSIRs) and combined quarter-wavelength 
(λ/4) SIRs and TSSIRs were studied. Design 
method and sample results are shown in the 
following.

conjunction with the flat insertion-loss 
response in the passband implies the good 
linear characteristic of the proposed wideband 
BPF. The fabricated wideband BPF, compact 
indeed, occupies an area of only 6.91×11.71 
mm2. 
(B) Design of Band-Notched UWB BPF 
with Very Wide Upper Stopband Using 
Combined λ/4 TSSIR [8]  
In the second part of Section 2, a new 
band-notched UWB BPF with a very wide 
upper stopband is designed using a λ/4–type 
multi-mode resonator (MMR). Refer to Fig. 3, 
the proposed MMR, being formed by 
combining two identical λ/4 TSSIRs in a 
structure-shared fashion, exhibits both λ/4 and 
embedded λ/2 types of resonance with a 
relatively smaller circuit size. By properly 
locating the first four resonant modes of the 
MMR and the coupling peaks of the 
input/output parallel-coupled lines, a 
five-transmission-pole UWB BPF is realized 
with a favorable uniform in-band UWB 
response.  
In this design, besides the good response 
in the UWB passband, a 5-GHz notched band 
and a very wide upper stopband are also of 
interest. The 5-GHz notched band is intended 
to reject the radio signal interferences from the 
wireless local-area network (WLAN) system 
for IEEE 802.11a (with a spectrum ranging 
from 5.15 to 5.825 GHz) and is created by 
embedding a proposed narrow-band T-shape 
lumped-element bandstop structure in the 
input feed line. On the other hand, the very 
wide upper stopband is established by 
implementing a compact wideband bandstop 
filter in the input feed line and meanwhile by 
properly locating the transmission zeros 
produced by the interdigital parallel-coupled 
lines and the second harmonic of the T-shape 
lumped-element bandstop structure in the 
upper stopband. The achieved upper-stopband 
performance is as good as those using other 
approaches [9, 10].  
In this work, the proposed band-notched 
UWB BPF circuit is printed on a 
0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate. 
The designed structural parameters for the 
prototype band-notched UWB BPF are L1 = 
1.45, L2 = 0.94, L3 = 4.12, L4 = 6.23, L5 = 1.13, 
L 6 = 0.23, L 7 = 0.2, L 8 = 0.8, L 9 =0.2, W1 = 
0.1, W 2 = 0.74, W 3 = 0.1, W 4 = 2.89, W 5 = 
1.55, W 6 = 0.26, W 7 = 0.1, S1 = S 2 = 0.1, and 
D = 0.95 (all units are in millimeter). Fig. 4 
demonstrates the simulated and measured 
S-parameters and group delay of the designed 
band-notched UWB BPF. The simulated and 
measured results are in reasonable agreement 
with each other. The measured (simulated) 
3-dB cutoff frequencies at the lower and upper 
UWB passband edges are 2.76 (2.63) and 
10.92 (10.98) GHz, respectively. The 
measured (simulated) notch band has a 3-dB 
bandwidth of 18% (17.5%). In the UWB 
passband except the notch, the measured 
(simulated) minimum insertion loss and return 
loss are 0.41 dB (0.39 dB) and 10 dB (14 dB), 
respectively, and the group delay varies 
between 0.38 and 0.49 ns. The measured 
upper-end -20-dB stopband ranges from 11.94 
to 30.56 GHz, with a bandwidth of 18.62 GHz.

 (4) A compact CPW-Fed UWB BPF Using 
Combined Microstrip SIR [12] 
In the fourth part of Section 2, a UWB 
BPF designed using CPW-fed combined λ/4 
microstrip SIR is proposed, as shown in Fig. 7. 
The first three resonant frequencies of the 
combined-SIR-based MMR were designed to 
be roughly equally spaced in the UWB 
passband. Two of the resonant frequencies are 
due to the inherent 4λ  SIRs and the other is 
owing to the embedded half-wavelength ( 2λ ) 
resonator that will exist as long as the two 
SIRs are combined in a structure-shared 
fashion.

                 (b) 
Figure 7 Schematics of proposed CPW-Fed 
UWB BPF: (a) top view and (b) bottom view 
Refer to Fig. 7, the MMR is coupled to 
the input/output CPW feed lines on opposite 
side of the substrate. With the gaps of the 
CPW widened, the coupling between the 
MMR and the CPW feed lines can be greatly 
enhanced. In addition, with the center signal 
line of the CPW split, the inner ground corner 
properly canted, and an additional coupling 
line section placed beside the MMR, the 
overall frequency response can be further 
improved. 
     In this design, the two sections of each 
λ/4 SIR are assumed to have the same electric 
length. Their corresponding impedance ratio 
can be determined analytically for any given 
first two resonant frequencies. The designed 
UWB BPF is to be implemented on a 
0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate 
with a dielectric constant of 10.2 and a loss 
tangent of 0.0023. In the first stage of the 
design, we will determine the dimensions of 
the MMR so that the first three resonant 
frequencies of the resonator are approximately 
equally spaced in the UWB. With W1 = 0.1, 
W2 = 0.6, W3 = 1.2, L1 = 4.145, L2 = 3.63, L3 
= 1.47, S = 0.125, and D = 0.95 (all in 
millimeter), the MMR, when gap coupled to 
the two 50-Ω  microstrip ports, are simulated 
(using Ansoft HFSS) to have five 
transmission poles in the 2-20 GHz range, as 
demonstrated in Fig. 8. In this figure, 1f  = 
3.58 GHz, 2f  = 10.48 GHz, and 3f  = 16.65 
GHz pertain to the first three resonant 
 8 
are for the purpose of aligning the circuit 
patterns on the top and bottom layers of the 
proposed structure. Their numerical values are 
immaterial and hence are not given here for 
simplicity. The simulated results are shown as 
the dotted line in Fig. 10, from which it can be 
found that between the first and the last |S11| 
nulls in the UWB passband, some |S11| peaks 
are still larger than -10 dB. We hence add into 
the structure a microstrip line section of W8 = 
0.1 and L6 = 8.89 mm that is parallel and very 
close to the embedded 2λ  UIR with a gap 
of G3 = 0.08 mm. Furthermore, the inner 
ground corner at the transition position is 
canted with W9 = 0.5 mm. Clearly, the added 
coupling line section and the canted ground 
do improve the |S11| curve in the UWB 
passband. Now, all the simulated |S11| peaks in 
the UWB passband are below -10 dB. The 
additional gain of adding the coupling line 
section is the transmission zero around 1.7 
GHz. This transmission zero is due to the 
cancellation of the signals transmitted through 
two different paths. The first (second) path is 
from one CPW feed through the MMR 
(coupling line section) to the other CPW feed. 
It has been verified that the transmitted 
signals through these two paths have nearly 
the same magnitude and a phase difference of 
roughly 180° at the transmission zero 
frequency. In the simulation for signals 
passing through the first (second) path, the 
coupling line section (the MMR) is removed 
from the schematic. For conciseness, the 
results are not shown here.

UWB BPF with or without the coupling line 
and the cant W9. 
 
Figure 11 Simulated and measured responses 
of the UWB BPF in Fig. 7. 
The fabricated BPF with dimensions 
detailed in the preceding section was 
measured using Anritsu 37269C vector 
network analyzer. Figure 11 shows the 
simulated and measured frequency responses 
of the fabricated UWB BPF. Reasonable 
agreement between these two sets of 
responses was observed. The measured results 
show a 3-dB passband (centered at 6.89 GHz,) 
ranging from 3.1 to 10.69 GHz, a rejection of 
greater than 20 dB in the upper stopband of 
11.22-17.36 GHz (a bandwidth of 6.14 GHz), 
and an insertion loss of less than 1 dB 
between the first and the last |S11| null 
frequencies (i.e., within 3.4-10.6 GHz). Also 
shown in Figure 6 is the measured group 
delay, whose in-band value is less than 0.56 
ns. The maximum in-band variation of about 
0.19 ns in the group delay implies good 
linearity of the proposed UWB BPF. 
Besides the above four sample results, 
there are other work completed in this projects 
and have been published in known journal [13, 
14].    
4. Conclusion and Self-Evaluation  
All the main research topics included in 
the project proposal have been completed. 
Results were divided into several parts and 
published in the well-known international 
journals such as “IET Microwaves, Antennas 
& Propagation,” “Microwave and Optical 
Technology Letters,” and “Journal of 
Electromagnetic Waves and Applications”

1f , 2f , and 3f  are specified, the required impedance ratios for the TSSIR shown in Fig. 1 can 
be determined using the analytic expressions derived in [6].  
 
In this paper, the proposed notched-band UWB BPF circuit is to be designed on a 0.635-mm-
thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with a dielectric constant of 10.2 and a loss tangent of 0.0023. 
By appropriately choosing the impedance ratios of the conventional TSSIR, we can evenly 
allocate the first five resonant modes of the TSSIR within the UWB passband of 3.1-10.6 
GHz (namely, at the frequency of 3.1, 4.975, 6.85, 8.725, and 10.6 GHz). The required 
impedance ratios for the conventional TSSIR can be calculated to be K1 = 2.445 and K2 = 1.5. 
The impedance of each section is designed to be Z1 = 18.6 Ω, Z2 = 27.8 Ω, and Z3 = 68 Ω, 
and the electric length of each line section at 3.1 GHz and 4.975 GHz can be calculated to 
be 01 40θ = °  and °= 6502θ . Fig. 2 shows the designed band-notched UWB BPF. The structure 
of the TSSIR in this filter circuit is modified with its line sections at the two open ends split 
into two identical parallel ones and the input/output feed lines sandwiched in between to 
enhance the coupling. The extension of the feed lines into the Z2 sections of the MMR 
provides not only further coupling strength, but also fine-tuning of the impedance matching 
between the feed lines and the MMR.  
 
Also shown in Fig. 2 are the open stubs of quarter-wavelength, which are embedded in the 
modified TSSIR to obtain the 5-GHz notched band and to produce out-of-band transmission 
zeros for rejection improvement of the upper stopband. As suggested in [4], the bandwidth of 
the transmission zeros can be controlled by adjusting the width and gap of the open stubs. To 
be specific, the longer open stubs having a line width (W6) and length (L6) of 0.58 mm and 
4.96 mm, respectively, are intended to create a notched band centered around 5.5 GHz. The 
four identical shorter open stubs with line width (W5) 0.15 mm and length (L5) 2.08 mm are 
to produce a transmission zero around the first spurious resonant frequency of the MMR 
beyond the UWB passband. The gaps of the open stubs are carefully designed to produce 
enough bandwidth for the notched band and the required upper stopband characteristic. It is 
noted that the wide upper stopband performance of the designed UWB BPF is achieved by 
three contributions. The first one is from the zero created by the shorter embedded open stubs 
just mentioned. The second one is from the longer open stubs, which, besides the first 
transmission zero in the notched band, also produce the second zero that is roughly three 
times the first one. The third contribution is from the input/output parallel-coupled structures, 
which produce an upper out-of-band zero.  
 
Since the split ends at the TSSIR and the embedded open stubs will all affect the behavior of 
the MMR, the impedance ratios and the structural parameters calculated for the conventional 
TSSIR will have to be fine-tuned to design the band-notched UWB BPF shown in Fig.2. 
Detailed structural parameters are shown in the caption of this figure. 
 
Simulated and Measured Results 
 
The proposed band-notched UWB BPF is simulated using AnsoftTM HFSS, a high frequency 
structure simulator, and then verified by measurement. Fig.3 demonstrates the simulated and 
measured S-parameters and group delay. The measured 3-dB cutoff frequencies at the lower 
and upper UWB passband edges are 2.97 and 10.92 GHz, respectively. The measured 
notched band is centered at 5.34 GHz with an insertion loss of 42.9 dB and a 3-dB notched 
band of 4.94-5.98 GHz. The second transmission zero due to the longer open stubs is around 
16 5f .=  GHz. The transmission zero around 14.98 GHz is produced by the interdigital
