A Biocatalyst for the Removal of Sulfite from Alcoholic Beverages 
INTRODUCTION 
 A number of disorders in humans have been 
proven to be associated with allergic responses to sulfites 
[1]. Sulfites are formed naturally in the body during the 
oxidative degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids, 
cysteine and methionine, resulting in the accumulation of 
sulfites which are toxic and must be further oxidized to 
sulfate to prevent adverse effects. Sulfites can also be 
introduced exogenously through environmental pollution 
or from the consumption of processed foods, such as 
dried fruits.  
 
 Sulfite hypersensitivities and other allergic 
responses are often difficult to diagnose and discriminate 
from other allergic responses. For this reason, the 
number of affected individuals is not known with 
certainty but is estimated to affect at least 3% of the 
population. The majorities of the reactions triggered by 
sulfites are generally mild and include dermatologic, 
respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms [1,2]. 
However, sulfite, particularly in wines, represents an 
important trigger of asthma and in severe bronchospasms 
[3-5]. The symptoms are presumed to be mediated by 
IgE-associated immune responses as well as by genetic 
defects in mitochondrial enzymes (e.g. rodanase).  
 
 The concentration of sulfite in wines can be as 
high as 300 ppm. Even without intentionally adding 
sulfite and taking great care in avoiding microbial 
contamination during wine manufacturing, sulfite 
concentrations of up to 40 ppm can still be detected in 
home-made organic wines.   In recognition of the 
potential health hazards to a proportion of the population 
with sulfite hypersensitivities, the U.S. FDA regulations 
require that wines sold in the U.S. which contain more 
than 10 ppm equivalents of sulfite be labeled as 
"contains sulfites".  Nevertheless, sulfites continue to be 
widely used in the wine industry and in other food 
processing industries as an effective color stabilizer and 
 4
lower than the characteristic pH of plant cells, the effect 
of pH on the activity of chloroplasts for sulfite oxidation 
was examined.  White wine (Sutter Home White 
Zinfandel) which has an alcohol content of 9.5 % v/v 
was spiked with sodium sulfite to a final sulfite 
concentration of 150 ppm and incubated with 1 mg/ml 
chloroplasts in the presence of different pH buffers.   
As shown in Fig. 1, the activity of chloroplasts in 
sulfite oxidation increased with pH until it reached an 
optimum at pH 8.5.  Under these conditions more than 
95 % of sulfite was removed after overnight incubation 
with 1 mg/ml chloroplasts, resulting in a residual sulfite 
concentration of 7.5 ppm. Similar levels of sulfite 
removal were observed with alcohol solutions (data not 
shown). As expected, the efficiency of sulfite removal 
increased proportionally with the concentration of 
chloroplasts.  Fig. 2 shows the efficiency of sulfite 
removal in white wines after 1 hr incubation with various 
concentrations of wheatgrass chloroplasts.  Whereas 
only 10 % of the initial concentration of sulfite was 
removed at a chloroplast concentration of 1 mg/ml, more 
than 95 % of sulfite was removed within one hr when a 
chloroplast concentration of 10 mg/ml was used.   The 
time course of sulfite oxidation with 1 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml 
chloroplasts is shown in Fig. 3.  More than 90 % of 
sulfite was oxidized with a chloroplast concentration of 5 
mg/ml within 3 hr.  
The effects of mixing and illumination on the 
efficiency of sulfite oxidation in white wines with a 
chloroplast concentration were evaluated.  As expected, 
under quiescent conditions mass transfer limitations 
reduced the rate of sulfite oxidation by the chloroplast 
suspension by 35-45 %.  Compared to sulfite oxidation 
experiments in flasks covered with aluminum foil, the 
efficiency of oxidation increased from 21.7 (± 0.5) % to 
37.3 (± 4.4) % under normal indoor illumination.  
These results indicate the participation of the 
chloroplast’s photosynthetic electron transport chain in 
sulfite oxidation, consistent with earlier reports pointing 
to the combined actions of sulfite oxidase and 
photosynthetic reactions [13].  It should be noted that in 
earlier studies Jolivet et al. estimated that sulfite oxidase 
accounted only for ca. one third of sulfite oxidation rate 
of chloroplasts under well-lit conditions [13].  
The presence of numerous light absorbing 
components in red wines could diminish the effect of 
illumination. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the 
removal of sulfite from Sutter Home Red Zinfandel 
which contains 13.5 % alcohol.   The effect of 
illumination on sulfite oxidation was not as significant as 
that observed in the Sutter Home White Zinfandel, used 
for all other experiments reported in this study, Fig. 4.  
The level of sulfite removal in red wines was merely 
enhanced from 83 % to 93 % with illumination. While 
the illumination-induced sulfite removal accounted for 
41.5 % of the total sulfite removal in white wines, it 
accounted only for 10.8 % of the total sulfite removal in 
red wines. This result further confirmed the participation 
of light-induced photosynthetic oxidation in sulfite 
oxidation, especially in white wines.  Surprisingly, 
however, the efficiency of sulfite removal in red wines 
was much higher than in white wines. Whereas in the 
white wine only 15 % of sulfite was removed with a 
chloroplast concentration of 1 mg/ml after 1.5 hr 
incubation (Fig. 2), 93 % and 100 % sulfite removal 
from the red wines was achieved with the same amount 
of chloroplasts within 45 min and 1.5 hrs, respectively, 
(Fig. 4).  
The higher efficiency of sulfite removal in red 
wines compared to that in white wines might be a result 
of the presence of positive effectors in red wines or the 
absence of negative effectors that might be present in 
white wines. However, the latter can be ruled out, since 
we have shown that the efficiency of sulfite removal in 
white wines and in alcohol solutions containing the same 
ethanol concentrations are comparable, indicating the 
absence of negative effectors in white wines for sulfite 
removal with chloroplasts.  We therefore postulate that 
red wines may contain positive effectors, such as 
polyphenols, that enhance the function of the enzyme 
systems carrying out sulfite oxidation.   
Organic solvents have been found to be 
destabilizing toward many oxidases [15]. Ethanol, with a 
polarity index of 4.3, could therefore exert an adverse 
effect on sulfite oxidase activity. White wines with final 
alcohol concentrations of 5-15% (v/v), prepared as 
described in Materials and Methods, were used to 
investigate the effect of alcohol concentration on sulfite 
removal. The efficiency of sulfite removal in aqueous 
solutions containing no ethanol was used as a reference. 
Sulfite oxidation was carried out using a chloroplast 
concentration of 1 mg/ml for 3 hr (Fig. 5). As the alcohol 
content of wines increased from 0 % to 5 %, the relative 
efficiency of sulfite oxidation was reduced by 66.4 %, 
indicating an adverse effect of ethanol toward sulfite 
oxidase and/or the pigment proteins of the photosynthetic 
electron transport chains. Nevertheless, sulfite oxidation 
could proceed at even much higher concentrations of 
ethanol up to at least 15 % ethanol. Under optimal 
conditions, the residual sulfite oxidation activity was 
sufficient to mediate complete removal of sulfite in red 
wines as demonstrated in Fig. 4. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The presence of sulfites in food, especially wines, 
presents a serious health risk toward consumers with 
sulfite hypersensitivities. Current technologies for sulfite 
removal require the use of complicated processes and 
can adversely affect the quality of the wine being treated. 
In this study we propose a simple biocatalytic process for 
the removal of sulfite in wines. Reduction of sulfite in 
wines to level below 10 ppm can be achieved with a 
chloroplast concentration of 5 mg/ml (equivalent to a 
0.5% suspension of chloroplasts) within three hrs in 
white wines or with a chloroplast concentration of 1 
mg/ml within 45 min in red wines. Although the overall 
sulfite oxidation activity of chloroplasts is strongly 
affected by pH, efficient sulfite removal can be achieved

白 質 輸 送 至 大 腸 桿 菌 之 周 質 空 間 ， 其
transolcators 之組成蛋白質、作用之機制及所需

如圖二所示。Sec系統利用膜蛋白 SecYEB 將 SecB/A
所保護之標的蛋白質以未折疊的狀態如同穿線的
方式輸送至周質空間 ; 而 Tat 系統則利用膜蛋白
TatABC 將標的蛋白質以完整折疊且具輔因子
(cofactor)的狀態輸送至周質空間。雖然Sec與Tat
系統之 signal sequences 具有相當程度的相似
性，但卻主宰帶白質輸送所採行的路徑。 
Tat 系統與 Sec 系統之 signal peptides 在 N
端同樣為具有帶正電基團支鏈的鹼性胺基酸與C端
具疏水性之胺基酸片段。根據已知之 signal 
peptides 序列發現 Tat signal peptides (35 ~ 50 
amino acid residues) 較 Sec signal peptides 
(15~25 amino acid residues)長；Tat signal 
peptides 疏 水片段之疏水性較 Sec signal 
peptides 之疏水片段低。而其主要差異在於 Tat 之
signal peptidesy在鹼性胺基酸片段與疏水性片段
間具有一特性之雙精胺酸 (twin arginine) 片
段，如表一所示。研究發現利用將 twin arginine
部分或全部以同樣具正電之鏈的離胺酸 (lysine)
取代時，輸送的效率大幅降低，甚至完全無法以 Tat
