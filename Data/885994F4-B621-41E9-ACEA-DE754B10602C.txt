Abstract 
    The occurrence of emerging contaminants in 
aquatic environments is an increasing concern in 
many of the European countries and US.  
Emerging contaminants are a group of 
non-regulated contaminants that still require U.S. 
EPA evaluations.  There hasn’t been a set of 
concentration limits, and the analytical procedures 
are not standardized yet.  They include a variety 
of compounds such as pharmaceuticals and 
personal care products (PPCPs), hormones and 
surfactant, etc.  Even though these compounds 
are present in a very trace amount (ng/L to few 
μg/L) in aquatic systems, they have been receiving 
great attentions because they are biologically 
active and are considered potentially harmful to 
both humans and aquatic life.   
The overall goal of this proposed research is 
to gain a better understanding of the occurrence of 
these compounds in Taiwan’s aquatic systems 
(reservoirs, lakes and rivers). 
Field samples were collected, filtered (0.2 
μm) and pretreated with solid-phase extraction 
(SPE) technique.  HPLC-MS/MS were used for 
analysis. 
The drinking water source at Taiwan is 
mostly reservoirs/rivers.  It’s important for us to 
know the occurrence of the emerging 
contaminants in these aquatic systems. Moreover, 
to understand their fate and transport in the future 
study in order to access our drinking water quality 
and to optimize our reservoir design.   
Keywords: Emerging contaminants, 
Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care 
Products (PPCPs), Endocrine 
Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) 
 
二、前言/研究目的 
Given the growing worldwide demand for 
fresh water, there is an increasing need to rely on 
degraded water resources, such as surface waters 
containing a high fraction of wastewater or treated 
effluent.    As a result, the presence of emerging 
contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and 
 4
samples.  SPE were performed using a 12-port 
vacuum extraction manifold.  Cartridges were 
conditioned by 5 mL methanol followed by 5 mL 
deionized (DI) water.  Water samples were 
loaded into the cartridges at the flow rate of 3-6 
mL/min.  The cartridges were then washed with 
6 mL of DI water, and dried using a stream of 
nitrogen.  Analytes were eluted with 8 mL of 
mixture of 50% methanol with DI water.  The 
extract was concentrated by a stream of nitrogen 
combined with heated bath of 37oC to 0.5 mL 
followed by filtering through a 0.22 μm aperture 
filters (13 mm diameter, material : PTFE) 
before HPLC-MS/MS analysis. 
 
HPLC-MS/MS analysis 
  Analysis were carried out using HPLC-MS/MS 
system (Applied Biosystems API 4000 
LC-MS/MS with data processing software, 
Analyst 1.4.2). Chromatographic separation was 
performed using HPLC column ： ZORBAX 
Eclipse XDB-C18 (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The 
mobile phases consisted mobile phase A (0.1% 
formic acid in deionized water) and mobile phase 
B (0.1% formic acid in 100% methanol). Liquid 
chromatographic gradient are shown in table 1. 
Detection was carried out using quadrupole mass 
spectrometer with electrospray Ionization (ESI) 
interface.  The analyses were done in positive ion 
mode for acetaminophen, propranolol, estrone, 
β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol and in 
negative ion mode for ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, 
ketoprofen, naproxen and diclofenac. In MS/MS 
system, the parameters of analyses were listed in 
table 2. Multiple reaction monitoring transition 
mode (MRM) was applied to obtain individually 
the optimal declustering potential (DP), collision 
energy (CE), collision cell exit potential (CXP) 
and transitions chosen, etc.  
 
Quantitation/Method Validation 
The standard solutions of concentration level 
50 and 500 ng/L were spiked into DI water and 
blank water sample at pH 7.0 to determine the 
recoveries of the spiked target compounds. The 
recoveries (mean of three replicate samples) and 
standard deviation of the target compounds are 
shown in table 3. At concentration of 50 and 500 
ng/L, recoveries ranged from 66.1 to 126.3 % and 
67 to 115 % for DI water sample and from 67.1 to 
139.7 % and 68.3 to 110.3 % for blank water 
samples, respectively. From the results, better 
recoveries were acquired with the high 
concentration (500 ng/L). 
The accuracy and precision were determined 
by the replicate samples (n=6) of blank water 
samples spiked at 50 and 500 ng/L over a period 
of 3 days. The parameters are showed in table 4. 
The accuracy at concentration levels of 50 and 500 
ng/L are between -13.3 and 18.4 % and between 
-8.0 and 17.8 %, respectively. The precision 
ranges from 1.0 to 13.9 % for 50 ng/L and 0.5 to 
6.8 % for 500 ng/L. 
The linearity of calibration curves was 
established using blank water sample spiked with 
analyses and fitted with a linear, least-squares 
linear regression analysis (y=a+bx) in the 
concentration range studied. For all target 
compounds, nine point (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 
1000, 2000 ng/L) calibration curves were 
constructed. The method detection limit (MDL) 
was determined from the minimum detectable 
concentration of analyses in the linear range with a 
signal-noise ratio of 3. The method validation 
parameters are presented in table 5. Method 
detection limits are 0.5 ng/L for acetaminophen 
and propranolol and 10 ng/L for other target 
compounds. The calibration curves are linear with 
correlation coefficients of all target compounds 
greater than 0.99. 
 
四、結果與討論 
Table 6 shows the concentration found for 
the 10 target compounds.  Two estrogens, estrone, 
17α-ethinylestradiol and one anti-inflammatory 
ketoprofen were not detected at any of the water 
samples.  β-estradiol was only detected once at 
trace level 20.3 ng/L.  Acetaminophen were seen 
in all samples and were detected at highest 
concentration ranging from 2.9 – 3227 ng/L.  
Ibuprofen was also presented in high 
concentrations ranging from 46-210 ng/L.  
Propranolol and diclofenac, even though occurred 
in half of the water samples, were less detected 
and with low concentrations (few ng/L).   
 Along the Sindian river, there were hospital 
wastewater and household water effluents coming 
in as sources of these pharmaceuticals and 
personal care products.  However, some of the 
natural attenuation processes along river transport 
could be the possible degradation processes for 
many of these compounds.  For example, 
ketoprofen is known to photodegrade with 
half-live of few minutes [15, 16]. This may be the 
reason why we do not observe ketoprofen in any 
of our water samples.  However, further 
experiments are needed to fully understand the 
fate and transport of these compounds in our 
surface aquatic systems.
