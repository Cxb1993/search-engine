Abstract—The building blocks of a 0.5-V receiver, 
including a receiver front-end and a low-pass filter 
are fabricated using 0.18-µm CMOS technology. 
At 5.6 GHz, the receiver front-end achieves a 
voltage gain of 17.1 dB and a noise figure of 8.7 
dB, while dissipating 19.4 mW. The fifth-order 
low-pass Chebyshev filter achieves a corner 
frequency of 2.6 MHz and an input-referred- noise 
of 28.5 nV/sqrt(Hz) at 6.8 mW. The receiver 
front-end is further integrated with the low-pass 
filters to form a highly- integrated receiver 
subsystem at ultra-low-voltage.

一、 前言 
Lately, CMOS technology has become very 
popular in the field of analog integrated circuits. 
Gate length shrinkage has caused transistor cut-off 
frequencies to rise to tens of GHz. This 
improvement favors the designs of CMOS circuit 
at high frequencies; meanwhile, manufacturers 
provide complete device libraries along with 
reliable high-frequency models. As CMOS RF 
gradually enters the mainstream of solid-state 
circuit design, the degree of integration of 
single-chip systems is effectively improved. 
However, to prevent transistors from fatal damage, 
the low voltage operation of circuits fabricated 
using modern CMOS technologies is crucial. 
RF/analog circuit designers definitely have to face 
serious challenges. This issue has drawn attention 
for a long time and many works have focused on 
the low-voltage operation of RF/analog circuits [1] 
- [6].  These works have successfully 
demonstrated the validity of using CMOS 
technology to implement ultra-low-voltage 
single-chip systems, encouraging the application 
of proposed techniques to other circuit topologies.  
 
二、研究目的 
 
This work is concerned with the design of a 0.5-V 
direct-conversion receiver for 5-GHz band 
wireless applications. Although the receiver 
architecture has been demonstrated elsewhere [7], 
operating a system at 0.5 V is very challenging. 
Therefore, the receiver front-end developed 
elsewhere is newly modified herein to cope with 
ultra-low supply voltage. Based on leap-frog 
topology, a fifth-order low-pass Chebyshev filter 
is implemented with low-voltage operational 
transconductance amplifiers (OTAs),  which 
employ standard transistors whose threshold 
voltage is reduced by forward-biasing the 
n-MOSFET bodies as performed elsewhere [4][5]. 
Of priority concern is to increase the OTA 
unity-gain frequency, thus facilitating the use of 
the low-pass filter (LPF) in a broadband access 
system. The LPF is then incorporated with the RF 
front-end to demonstrate a highly integrated 
low-voltage receiver subsystem. 
 
三、研究方法 
 
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a receiver 
subsystem based on subharmonic-LO pumped 
architecture. This receiver subsystem has a 
low-noise-amplifier (LNA), a quadrature coupler 
(QC), a pair of subharmonic-LO pumped mixers 
(SHMs) and low-pass filters. The received signal 
is amplified by the single-ended LNA and then 
split into I/Q branches by the quadrature coupler, 
which is a lump alternative to the 3-dB directional 
coupler [7]. On-chip transformers with stacked 
structures are designed to perform 
single-to-differential conversion in RF/LO paths 
and must be treated as components of impedance 
matching networks.  Resistor-capacitor poly- 
phase-shifters are adopted to generate the required 
LO signals of the doubly balanced SHMs.

building blocks, including the low noise amplifier, 
the directional coupler and the sub-harmonic 
mixers (SHMs) [7], where all of the active devices 
are low-threshold-voltage MOSFETs, and each 
circuit can thus function well at ultra-low voltage.

四、 結果與討論 
 
All of the described RF/analog circuits are 
fabricated using UMC 0.18-µm CMOS 
technology. Fig. 10 presents the chip 
photograph of the receiver subsystem.  
The receiver front-end was tested on-wafer. 
Dissipating 19.4 mW from a 0.5-V voltage 
supply, the RF front-end has a voltage gain of 
17.1 dB and an IIP3 of -17.9 dBm at 5.6 GHz. 
Fig. 11 plots the measured and simulated input 
return loss (S11) curves, where the achieved S11 
is less than -10 dB over the band of interest. 
Comprising Metal-6 and Metal-5, a wide metal 
line with a length of 400 um and a thickness of 
2.6 um was used as the source inductor of the 
LNA and the EM simulation revealed its 
inductance to be 0.2 nH. However, the 
measured input impedance has a smaller real 
part (40.3Ω) than the simulation result (50.2Ω), 
indicating that the source inductor may be 
under-estimated.

Measurement Simulation
 
Fig.11 Measured and simulated S11 curves of receiver 
front-end. 
 
During the measurement of I/Q imbalances at 
the base-band outputs of the mixers, the 
frequency of output base-band signals was set 
to 100 kHz and 36-inch Astrolab coaxial test 
cables, supporting up to 26.5 GHz, were used 
to enable the losses and phase shifts due to the 
cables or connectors to be minimized without 
additional calibration. Therefore, the accuracy 
of measurement depends entirely on the 
magnitude and phase stabilities of the cables, 
which are 0.2 dB and 0.0001°, respectively. Fig. 
12 plots the measured and simulated I/Q 
imbalances from 4.9 to 5.9 GHz, and where the 
variations in the gain and phase errors are less 
than 0.8 dB and 0.7° within a frequency band 
from 5.5 to 5.8 GHz.  
The quadrature coupler was designed with a 
characteristic impedance of 50 ohm. Therefore, 
if the port terminations of the quadrature 
coupler are not 50 ohm, then I/Q imbalances 
may occur. Additionally, complex impedances 
cause unwanted phase shifts and severer phase 
imbalances. As shown in Fig. 12 (a), the 
simulated and measured phase imbalances at 
frequencies of below 5.4 GHz are attributed to 
the imperfect impedance matching between the 
quadrature coupler and its succeeding 
transformers over the band. The differences 
between the simulated and measured results are 
caused mainly by the inaccuracy of the device 
model. Since the phase imbalances are very 
sensitive to complex port impedances, the 
discrepancies between the measured and 
simulated phases (Fig. 12 (a)) exceed those 
between measured and simulated magnitudes

Although the receiver front-end operates at a 
higher frequency, it has a lower noise figure 
than in two other works [3] and [5]. Moreover, 
it employs LC-folded cascode SHMs to reduce 
LO-self-mixing. The achieved LO-to-RF 
leakage of -60.3 dBm and LO signal rejection 
of 43.3 dB yield an input-referred dynamic 
dc-offset of -103.6 dBm, which is below the 
WLAN receiver input noise floor (-100.9 dBm), 
when a 20-MHz bandwidth is considered. 
 
The 0.5-V receiver subsystem comprising 
the receiver front-end and the low-pass filters 
is also tested on a PCB. Since the bond-wires 
and metal traces on PCBs affect the input 
impedance, off-chip surface mount devices 
(SMDs) were used to obtain 50- impedance  
matching. Fig. 15 plots the measured frequency 
response of the 0.5-V receiver subsystem; the 
corner frequency is 1.6 MHz.

Notably, the 0.5-V receiver subsystem and the 
circuits in other works [3]-[5] may suffer from 
a critical problem. Since supply voltage scaling 
depends on reducing the threshold voltage, the 
bodies of MOS transistors are forward-biased 
and some circuits include low threshold 
voltage devices, exponentially increasing the 
leakage current. Even when the transistors are 
turned off, the current leaks through them and 
the static power is significantly increased. 
 
This work describes the feasibility of 
ultra-low-voltage CMOS RF/analog 
circuits. The OTA design technique 
proposed in another work [4] was improved 
by preventing the potential OTA 
malfunction. The LPF implemented with 
this newly modified OTA exhibits a low 
input-referred noise spectral density of 28.5 
nV/sqrt (Hz) and a corner frequency of 2.6

“Design of Femto-joule Energy Efficient ADCs in CMOS” 
Geert Van der Plas, IMEC 
 
In recent years significant energy efficiency improvements in A/D converters have been 
realized. Where a few years ago energy efficiencies of around 1pJ/conversion step were 
considered state-of-the-art, nowadays efficiencies down to fJ/conversion step are being 
reported. 
 
In this tutorial the techniques and architectures used to reduce the power consumption of 
data converters designed in nanometer CMOS processes for wireless applications will be 
explained. The tutorial will first introduce the basics of A/D converters, their performance 
specifications and typical architectures. Next the techniques used to improve energy efficiency 
will be introduced and examples of implementations will be given. 
 
These include fully dynamically clocked flash type converters with offset compensation 
that enables 50fJ/step data conversion for a 5b 1.75GS/s data converter. The passive charge 
sharing SAR A/D technique with noise reduction by redundancy similarly improves the energy 
efficiency to 54 fJ/step for a 9b 40MS/s design. And finally, a two-step architecture employing 
the C ABS principle, which is a new implementation of a successive approximation algorithm, 
improves the power efficiency to 10fJ/conversion step for a 7b 150MS/s converter. All this 
will be explained in detail, with emphasis on design issues relevant for a successful
