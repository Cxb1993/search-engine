The PMC model was introduced, which is the most well-studied system-level diagnosis model. 
It assumes that each processor can test its neighboring processors and declare them fault-free or 
faulty. The test results are considered reliable if the testing processors are fault-free. Two diagnosis 
strategies: one-step diagnosis and sequential diagnosis. One-step diagnosis identifies all faulty 
processors at a time before repair, whereas sequential diagnosis identifies (and repairs) faulty 
processors iteratively. In sequential diagnosis, at least one faulty processor can be identified in each 
iteration. Recently, a new diagnosis strategy, named (t, k)-diagnosis, was introduced. It identifies 
(and repairs) at least k faulty processors in each iteration provided there are at most t faulty 
processors. When fewer than k faulty processors remain, all faulty processors can be identified. 
Clearly, one-step diagnosis (k=t) and sequential diagnosis (k=1) are two instances of (t, k)-diagnosis. 
There are two commonly used fault models: random faults and conditional faults. The random 
fault model assumes that faulty processors may occur everywhere without any restriction, whereas 
the conditional fault model assumes that the fault distribution must be subject to some constraints, 
e.g., each processor neighboring to at least one fault-free processor. Suppose that S is a system with 
at most t faulty processors. When the random fault model is concerned, S is one-step t-diagnosable 
(sequentially t-diagnosable and (t, k)-diagnosable, respectively), if S can be diagnosed with one-step

Simulation results show that our protocol have lower cost, lower 
search latency, and well scalability comparing with the other 
previous work. Even though our initial successful query rate is 
less than other works, our successful query rate is as good as 
previous works after a short period due to that spatial locality is 
enhanced over time.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as following. Section 
II reviews the related work in this field. The scheme of our 
resource sharing protocol is described in Section III. In Section 
IV, we evaluate the performance of our protocol using network 
simulators. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section V. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
In quorum-based approaches, location information of resource 
holders are stored in real/virtual coordinates which are determined 
by hash functions. According to whether quorums are dependent 
on the location of resource holders/requesters, quorum-based 
approaches can further divided into location-invariant and 
location-variant.  
Most of quorum approaches are location- invariant. However, 
this kind of approaches has poor scalability, long search latency 
and high cost. In [13], a location-invariant approach, called GHT, 
is introduced. The map is divided into grids and quorums  are 
grids which are computed by a specific hash function. Intersection 
location service (ILS) [3] is an approach for location service. In 
ILS, only road intersections are chosen as quorums. In [9], an 
infrastructure-based traffic information system is introduced. A 
virtual two-dimensional space is developed for determining 
quorums. In [6], PAV develops a chord ring structure for 
determining quorums. In [5], VITP considers location-aware 
resources, i.e., available parking slots.  Quorums are chosen to be 
vicinity of target areas, i.e., parking areas.  
In [10], a location-variant approach for location service, called 
Region-Based Location Service Management Protocol (RLSMP) 
[10], is proposed. The quorum corresponding to a specific 
resource holder (or requester) is the cluster which it currently 
belongs to. If the desired vehicle’s location information is not 
available in a requester’ quorum, then the requester sent its 
request to other cluster in spiral around current cluster until it 
finds out the desired vehicle’s location information. In fact, 
RLSMP is semi-location-variant. Since clusters are predefined in 
RLSMP, quorums corresponding to two close resource holders 
may be distinct, while quorums corresponding to two far apart 
resource holders may be the same one. In [8], GLS is introduced 
to track the location of mobile nodes in MANET. 
 Our protocol is completely location-variant. The main idea of 
our protocol comes from typhoons. Typhoons move according to 
their eyes’ mobility. In our protocol, quorums corresponding to a 
given resource holder (or requester) is completely dependent on 
the location of the resource holder (or requester).  
III. RESOURCES SHARING SCHEME 
According to spatial locality between requesters and resource 
holders, resource search in a requester’s vicinity is sufficient. 
Besides, due to regular/sudden disconnection in VANETs, large 
research area would result in higher communication overhead and 
incomplete transmission with high possibility. Hence, it is 
reasonable that quorums corresponding to a resource holder is 
near the resource holder. 
3.1 Assumption 
Before introducing our protocol, we have some assumptions. 
We assume that each vehicle is equipped with GPS and navigation 
software which is installed a digital map. We assume that the 
navigation software has traffic information computing from the 
historical data. The driver could know his current position or any 
specific location’s position by the digital map. We divide the 
digital map into uniform sized grids. Each grid has its own unique 
global coordinate  !" #$ produced by longitude and latitude. We 
also define that local coordinate of a grid  !" #$  to 
be%&!%'()%*" #%'()%*+, where L is the tolerable updating distance 
(due to regular/sudden disconnection in VANETS, long updating 
distance results in high update failure rate and high update cost.  
So, updating distance should not be too long). Clearly, more than 
one grid has the same local coordinate. In Fig. 3.1, nine dark gray 
grids have the same local coordinates when L=4.  
 
Fig. 3.1 Dark gray grids have the same local coordinates &,"-+. 
For ease of the following discussion, we let S be the holder of 
resource R, while Q is a requester which queries R. Define the 
update area of resource holder S to be the area which quorums 
responsible for storing S’s information belong to. We also define 
the query area of requester Q to be the area which quorums 
responsible for replying Q’s request belong to.

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this Section, we compare the performance of BGR, NSFS, 
RLSMP [10], flooding based and GHT [13]. 
We use ns-2 and VANETMobiSim to simulate the performance 
of aforementioned protocols. We use VANETMobiSim to 
simulate the moving behavior of vehicles on the roads. There are 
seven vertical roads and seven horizontal roads and 400 vehicles 
in every 4000 meters ͪ 4000 meters area. Vehicles have speed 
varied from 0 to 60 km/hr and random destinations. Traffic lights 
change every 30 seconds. We use ns-2 to simulate the wireless 
networks, and the communication range is 250 meters. The 
moving information of each node is provided by 
VANETMobiSim. There are ten requesters per minute. If the 
requester are fail to get resource, they would request again in next 
minute. The network is divided into uniform sized grids. Each 
grid has side length 500 meters ͪ 500 meters. There are three 
kinds of network sizes, small, medium, and large (see Table 4.1).  
Four performance measures: successful query rate, average hop 
counts of lookup resource, average hop counts of querying data, 
total number of update and total hop counts of update, are 
considered. In RLSMP, the cluster size is equal to the query area 
in each scenario.

4.1 Successful query rate 
          Figure 4.1 shows that flooding protocol with 80 hops, 
RLSMP, and GHT have nearly 100% successful query rate. 
Although flooding with 20 hops, NSFS, and BGR have lower 
successful query rate initially (because only vicinity of requesters 
are searched), they have near the same successful query rate with 
the other two protocols after 3 minutes. This is because the 
number of resource holders increases over time (i.e., requesters 
which successful get the resources become resource holders), 
which enhances the spatial locality between the requesters and 
resource holders. BGR has higher successful query rate than 
NSFS in first 3 minutes because more locations are used to store 
the information of resource holders in BGR.  
4.2 Query cost 
Figure 4.2 shows the simulation result of obtaining the 
information of resource holders. 80-hop flooding has highest cost 
because request packets are always transmitted 80 hops no matter 
they have or have not met resource holders. GHT has second 
highest query cost because resource holders information are 
stored in a fixed grid corresponding to resources’ name. Although 
in RLSMP, BGR, and NSFS, resource holders’ information are 
stored in resource holders’ vicinity, RLSMP have higher cost than 
that of BGR and NSFS. RLSMP has lower successful query rate 
in requesters’ cluster, and hence request packets have to be 
forwarded to other clusters, which leads to higher cost. 
 
 
Figure 4.1: Successful query rate. 
 
Figure 4.2: Average hop counts of request. 
In Figure 4.3, we present the average hop counts of querying a 
resource, including the hop counts for finding the information of 
resource holders and the hop counts for finding a resource holder. 
Flooding protocol has lowest hop counts because requesters could 
always find out a resource holder by a shortest path (since the 
request packet is transmitted to the whole network) and there is no 
need to find information of resource holders. GHT protocol has 
the largest hop counts because the location for storing the 
information of resource holders is independent of the locations of 
requesters and resource holders, i.e., they may be far from each 
other two. RLSMP has more hop counts that BGR and NSFS 
because RLSMP spends more hop count in finding the 
information of resource holders.
