英 文 摘 要 ： Polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 
hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are persistent organic 
pollutants (POPs) of great adverse environmental 
impact. It is utmost importance, therefore, to seek 
effective methods to remove HCB and PBDEs from the 
environment. The reduction of HCB by Pd/Fe was faster 
than nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI). For HCB and 
DBDE, increasing the dose of NZVI enhanced the 
dechlorination rates. With an increase in 
temperature, the degradation rate increases. The 
dechlorination rates increased with decreasing pH. 
The dehalogenation is favorable under acid 
conditions. The degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI 
was not influenced by the HCO3-, Mg2+, and Na+, but 
enhanced with Cl- and SO42-. The NO3- competes with 
HCB so it inhibits the degradation. Cu2+ enhanced 
reactions due to the reduced form of copper. The 
stepwise dechlorination pathway of HCB with NZVI was 
the dominant reaction. However, the debromination of 
PBDEs from para positions is more difficult than that 
from meta or ortho positions. Adsorption on NZVI also 
plays a role on the removal of DBDE. We also 
conducted to investigate the removal of DBDE by using 
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized Ni/Fe 
bimetallic nanoparticles (CMC-Ni/Fe). DBDE can be 
quickly removed by CMC-Ni/Fe. The rate constants and 
removal efficiencies of DBDE with CMC-Ni/Fe increased 
with increasing pH. Compared with pure water, four 
anions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, and HPO42-) at 10 mM 
reflect a slight enhancement in the order of NO3-＞MQ 
water≒Cl-≒HPO42-＞HCO3-. However, at 1 mM of these 
electrolytes, all four anions seem to slightly hinder 
the removal rates. With humic acid (HA) 
concentrations increased, the rate constants slightly 
decreased due to the complexation between HA and iron 
species. Finally, we identified the destruction 
mechanisms of these two POPs by NZVI and elucidated 
the effect of several environmental factors. These 
findings can facilitate engineers to enhance the 
performance of NZVI in the subsurface.

The degradation kinetics was not influenced by the HCO3-, Mg2+, and Na+ ions. It was enhanced 
in the presence of the Cl- and SO42- ions due to their corrosion promotion. The NO3- competes 
with HCB so it inhibits the degradation reaction. Compared to the presence of Na2SO4, FeSO4 
would inhibit the degradation reaction due to passivation layer formed, while it was enhanced in 
the presence of Cu2+ ions resulted from the reduced form of copper on NZVI surfaces. These 
observations lead to a better understanding of HCB dechlorination with NZVI particles and can 
facilitate the remediation design and prediction of treatment efficiency of HCB at remediation 
sites. 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) recognized as a new class of environmental 
persistent toxic contaminants have been distributed widely in the world. NZVI was used to 
investigate the removal kinetics and mechanisms of decabrominated diphenyl ether (DBDE) at 
different pH. Within 40 minutes 90% of DBDE was rapidly removed by NZVI as compared to 
around 40 days needed for 24-fold weight of microscale ZVI. The removal by NZVI is much 
faster than that by microscale ZVI due to its high surface area and reactivity. At a different pH, 
the pseudo-first-order removal rate constants of DBDE linearly increased from 0.016 to 0.024 
min-1 with the decreasing of aqueous initial pH values from 10 to 5. The degradation of DBDE 
with NZVI is favorable in an acid condition. The debromination pathways of DBDE with NZVI 
were proposed on the basis of the identified reaction intermediates ranging from nona- to 
mono-brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) for an acid condition and from nona- to penta-BDEs 
for an alkaline condition. The debromination of PBDEs from para positions is more difficult than 
that from meta or ortho positions. Adsorption on NZVI also plays a role on the removal of DBDE. 
For the reaction rates in soils, two soils, Longgang soil and Lugang soil, were used to investigate 
the removal of DBDE with NZVI. The removal rate of DBDE in Longgang soil was faster than 
that in Lugang soil probably due to the lower pH of Longgang soil. These findings can facilitate 
the treatment and fate prediction of PBDEs with NZVI in the environment. 
PBDEs belong to the large family of brominated flame retardants and are widely used as 
additives in many household and commercial products to reduce their flammability. Because of 
its environmental persistence and high production volume in the past, PBDEs has been widely 
detected in the environment. NZVI has been extended to the waste treatments and remediation of 
many halogenated organic contaminants in the recent years, though NZVI nanoparticles tend to 
form aggregates very soon and inhibit the reactivity and mobility in situ remediation. In order to 
prevent aggregation of metallic nanoparticles, particle stabilization has been commonly practiced 
by attaching a stabilizer such as a polyelectrolytes or surfactant onto the nanoparticles. Recently, 
the feasibility of stabilized iron nanoparticle in subsurface environment remediation is getting a 
lot of attentions. It is important to know the interaction between stabilized nanoparticles and 
groundwater electrolytes. We conducted to investigate the removal of DBDE by using sodium 
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized Ni/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles (CMC-Ni/Fe) with 
various environmental factors such as pH, temperature, anions, and humic acid. The effects of 
environmental factors such as temperature, pH, anions, and humic acid on the degradation 
kinetics were evaluated in this study. DBDE was almost removed from aqueous solutions by 
CMC-Ni/Fe with 5 g/L iron loading in 60 min. The kobs became larger when the content of Ni 
loading increased. The DBDE removal percentage increased from 61 % to 94 % when Ni loading 
increased from 0.5 to 5.0 wt % while only 20 % for CMC-Fe. The rate constants and removal 
efficiencies of DBDE with CMC-Ni/Fe increased with increasing the initial pHs from 5 to 10. 
The inverse trend of pH as compared to literature could be attributed to the carboxyl groups of 
CMC are protonized in acidic conditions and this decomposition of the carboxyl cellulose chain 
may partly reduce the sorption of CMC on nanoparticles. The activated energy of CMC-Ni/Fe 
nanoparticle was 37.69 kJ/mol. Among four common electrolytes, an inhibition effect of four 
anions is observed on CMC-Ni/Fe with low concentration of anions (1 mM). With increasing ion 
concentrations to 10 mM, the reaction rates of CMC-Ni/Fe particles increase. Compared with 
Milli-Q system, four common anions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, and HPO42-) in the reaction solutions 
reflect a slightly enhanced removal rate in the presence of 10 mM concentration of anions in the 
order of NO3-＞MQ water Cl≒ - HPO≒ 42-＞HCO3-. However, at 1 mM of these electrolytes, all 
four anions seem to hinder the removal rates of DBDE by CMC-Ni/Fe significantly in the order

1. Introduction 
Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is one of the twelve persistent organic pollutants, which required 
the inventory and the action plan by the Stockholm Convention due to its high toxicity, extensive 
existence and long-term persistence. Moreover, it is recalcitrant to degradation and has harmful 
effects on human beings and the environment. HCB is still emitted from the waste stream during 
the manufacture of several chlorinated hydrocarbons and some electric arc furnaces [1] although 
the commercial production of HCB is banned in many countries. A highly HCB contaminated site 
was found in central China [2]. HCB has been confirmed as an animal carcinogen and has the 
potential to cause damage to human organs [3-7]. Several studies [5-7] indicate that a possible 
association between these HCB exposure and the risk of human breast cancer. Halogenated 
organic compounds, present in the subsurface as dense nonaqueous phase liquids, are also 
common long-term sources to groundwater pollutants in the environment. The remediation of 
these pollutants requires powerful and cost-effective technologies to treat them and clean the sites 
up. 
Polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) belongs to the large family of brominated flame 
retardants (BFRs) and is widely used as additives in many household and commercial products to 
reduce their flammability. The ubiquitous distribution, hydrophobic characteristic, biochemical 
and toxic effects of PBDEs, linking to human exposure and health risk have been investigated [8]. 
Concerns have increased due to their occurrence in the environment and humans during the past 
years [9]. Recent studies have also shown that PBDEs are widespread in the freshwater and 
marine environments worldwide, furthermore bioaccumulate in food webs [10, 11]. 
Decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE) comprises approximately 80% of the world market demand 
for PBDEs, which in 2001 was reported at 56,100 metric tons [12]. PBDE is one kind of 
persistent organic pollutants [13] and is expected to sorb onto soil or sediment particles following 
release into the environment owing to its and potential toxicity to wildlife and humans [14-17]. 
Recently, zerovalent iron (ZVI) has been intensively studied for the remediation of a wide 
range of contaminants including chlorinated organic compounds [18-20]. Zerovalent iron has 
been demonstrated to successfully remove these contaminants. For halogenated compounds, the 
general dehalogenation reaction can be represented by 
-20 XRHFeHRXFe ++→++ ++               (1) 
Zerovalent iron has been used to remediate chlorinated organic compound contaminated 
groundwater through the use of permeable barriers; however, the investigations into its 
application for persistent organic pollutants have been limited. And the particle size and reactivity 
of conventional ZVI may limit its application into the subsurface environment. 
Nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) has been a better candidate as a remedial agent than 
microscale ZVI for polyhalogenated organic compounds [21-23]. The rapid chemical reduction of 
chlorinated organic compounds with NZVI was observed because NZVI has a larger specific 
surface area and higher surface activity than microscale ZVI [24]. Nanoscale zero valent iron 
(NZVI) has been developed to rapidly and completely chemically reduce halogenated 
hydrocarbons [21-23]. The chemical reduction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) has also been 
demonstrated [21]. The rapid chemical reduction of PCB with nanoscale zerovalent iron was 
observed because NZVI has a larger specific surface area and higher surface activity than 
microscale ZVI [24]. Nanoscale ZVI has been a better candidate as a remedial agent than 
microscale ZVI for polyhalogenated organic compounds. 
Bimetallic particles such as Pd/Fe, Ni/Fe, and Pt/Fe were also utilized to treat halogenated 
hydrocarbons and exhibit a high efficacy for the transformation of these chlorinated compounds. 
For example, Ni/Fe and Cu/Fe particles were used to reduce 1,1,1-trichloroethane [25]. Lien and 
Zhang [26] used palladized iron particles to rapidly transform chlorinated methanes within one 
hour. The enhancement of chemical degradation of halogenated compounds on iron particles by 
using Pd as the second metal has been demonstrated to rapidly dechlorinate chlorinated ethenes 
and effectively transform PCBs [27]. The degraded byproducts could be sometimes more toxic 
than their parent compounds. However, the effects of bimetallic Pd/Fe in nanoscale on chemical 
reduction rates and the byproducts of HCB were not well understood. 
Common cations in water, soil and groundwater will affect the degradation of halogenated 
 7
transformation with NZVI under different pH conditions and different temperature conditions, 
and to propose the degradation pathway. The chemical degradation behaviors of HCB with 
nanoscale zerovalent iron will be proposed to evaluate the possibility of applying nanoscale iron 
particles in the environment. In order to assess the applicability of NZVI for remediation of HCB 
contaminated soil and groundwater, this study examined the effect of various cations and anions 
normally present in soil and groundwater on the removal kinetics and efficiency of HCB by 
NZVI. 
Furthermore, this study was also undertaken to assess the degradation reactivity of DBDE 
toward NZVI and evaluate its efficiency by comparing it to microscale ZVI, examine the kinetics 
of DBDE transformation with NZVI under different pH conditions, assess the resulting 
distribution of reaction products, evaluate the removal mechanism, and propose the degradation 
pathways. The removal kinetics and removal efficiency of DBDE by CMC stabilized CMC-Ni/Fe 
bimetallic nanoparticles are investigated. The environmental factors such as Ni loadings, 
temperature, anions, and humic acid on the degradation kinetics and removal efficiency of DBDE 
by CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles are examined. These findings can facilitate the design of treatment 
for DBDE removal by CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles.

splitless mode with the injector temperature set at 330  and detector set at 340 . Separation ℃ ℃
was conducted with a temperature program that started at an oven temperature at 60  and then ℃
ramped at 5  min℃ -1 to 200 , held for 3 min, and then ramped at 10  min℃ ℃ -1 until it reached 
250 . For the byproduct analysis, the identification and quantification were performed by ℃
GC-MS and GC-μECD utilizing the same chromatographic conditions. 
Separation was conducted with a temperature program that started oven temperature at 80 oC 
and then ramped at 5 oC /min to 90 oC, and then from 90 oC at 50 oC /min to 270 oC, and then 
ramped at 1 oC /min until it reached 280 oC. For the byproduct analysis, all chlorobenzenes 
standards were purchased from Ultra Scientific Co. The identification and quantification of all 
chlorobenzenes were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 
GC-μECD with an oven temperature program: ramping from 60 oC at rate of 5 oC /min to 200 oC 
and hold 3 min, and finally ramping from 200 oC at 10 oC /min to 250 oC. 
 
2.6. Treatment of DBDE by NZVI 
Batch experiments were conducted to investigate reactivity of the NZVI particles for 
debromination of DBDE. A 1 mL stock solution of DBDE (70 mg/L) in toluene was added in to 
25 mL amber serum vials, and the toluene was removed by air-drying in the dark (Ahn et al., 
2006; Shih and Wang, 2009), then 25 ml of deionized water mixed with around 0.5 g of NZVI 
particles was added. Each bottle was covered with a Teflon-lined cap and incubated at 25 oC 
while mixing on a rotary shaker (125 rpm). Controls without NZVI were prepared according to 
the same procedures. Parallel experiments were also performed with an Aldrich microscale iron 
around 12 g, which is 24-fold weight increase to the NZVI particles. Three replicates were done 
for all the experiments. The pH control at low pH values by several buffer solutions was not 
achieved in this study. Chen et al. (2001) and Su and Plus (2007) also indicated that hydroxyl 
ions produced from zerovalent iron exhausted the buffer capacity of the solution and caused the 
pH to significantly increase. HCl or NaOH was used to control the pH. In this study, the initial 
pH was controlled within the ranges of pH 5 to 10. 
 
2.7. Degradation of DBDE by CMC-Ni/Fe 
The DBDE stock solution was made by using ethyl acetate (EA) as solvent. And a DBDE 
simulated solution was prepared by spiking a known volume of the stock solution into a certain 
proportion of EA/methanol/water to combined EA stock solution with water system. Batch 
experiments were conducted in amber vials capped with Teflon-coated septa. A desired amount 
of freshly prepared CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles were added into an amber vial, which contained 
both premade DBDE solution and water. Control experiments were also carries out without CMC 
stabilized Ni/Fe nanoparticles. Each batch reactor was took place at room temperature (25 ) ℃
with continuously shake (100 rpm) throughout the experiments. To study the effect of 
environmental factors such as temperature, pH, anions (nitrate, chloride, bicarbonate, and 
hydrogen phosphate), and humic acid on the degradation kinetics of DBDE by CMC-Ni/Fe 
nanoparticles, three replicates are done for all the experiments. The pH of the samples was 
adjusted with HCl and NaOH. At predetermined time interval samples were extracted three times 
with EA and analyzed through gas chromatography (GC). The samples were also conducted to 
determine the concentration of DBDE adsorbed on Fe surface and residual in solutions. After 60 
min, each vial was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min (Hermle, Z323) to separates the solid 
phase and liquid phase and extracted with EA for three times until there no any DBDE was 
detected. 
 
2.8. Analysis of DBDE intermediates 
At selected time intervals, PBDEs were extracted three times with a mixture of acetone and 
n-hexane (1:1, v/v), combined and then concentrated to 1 mL. PBDEs in the extracts were 
analyzed with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a micro-electron capture 
detector (μECD) and an Agilent 5975B mass spectrometer (MS) for quantification and structural 
confirmation, respectively. A 15 m DB-5HT capillary column was used. The carrier gas was 
chromatographic grade nitrogen gas. Sample injection volumes were 1 μL with the injector 
 11
were calculated to be 0.14 hr-1 and 0.23 hr-1, respectively (Table 3.1-1). The results suggested that 
nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles could reduce HCB more rapidly than nanoscale Fe particles. 
It could result from the enhancement of electron release on Fe surface by the potential difference 
between Pd and Fe and the catalysis role of Pd. The reduction rate of HCB became slowly after 
about 24 hours. It may be caused by the production of hydroxide substances or salts precipitation 
on the nanoscale Fe and nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles surface to reduce reactive surface. 
Lien and Zhang [24] indicated that the increased reactivity of nanoscale zero iron surface 
has been resulted from the presence of the Pd metal when they used nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic 
particles to reduce chlorinated ethenes. Kim and Carraway [28] have studied the effects of 
bimetal combinations on catalytic dechlorination by adding palladium on microsacle zero-valent 
irons to treat trichloroethylene. They also indicated that the addition of palladium could exhibit 
faster reaction rates than the corresponding zero-valent iron metal due to the enhancement of 
electron release from bimetal surface.  
The degradation rate constants with Pd/Fe nanoparticles were 2.1 hr-1 for tetrachloroethene 
and 3.2 hr-1 for trichloroethene [24]. Lien and Zhang [29] observed the reduction rate constants 
for chloronated ethanes such as 3.43 hr-1 for hexachloroethane, 4.46 hr-1 for pentachloroethane, 
3.60 hr-1 for 1,1,1,2-terachloroethane, 1.51 hr-1 for 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroehane, and 0.93 hr-1 for 1.51 
1,1,1-trichloroethane. The rate constants of chloroethanes and chloroethenes in their studies are 
higher than that for hexachlorobenzene in this study around one order magnitude. It could result 
from that the more recalcitrant molecualr structure of chlorobenzenes than chloronated aliphatic 
compounds and higher Pd loadings of around 0.1%~0.5% on nanoiron particles in their 
experiments as compared to our study. Another reason could be the higher surface area on their 
samller particle size around 66 nm than ours around 90 nm because smaller particle size might 
result in a greater density of reactive surface sites or surface sites of higher intrinsic reactivity [18, 
30].  
The variation of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) during the experiments is shown in 
Figure 3.1-4. The initial ORP value of around 65 mV decreased instantly to -300 mV after adding 
nanoscale Fe particles or nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles. Without zero-valent metals, the 
value of ORP was a constant. These zero-valent metals have a high reduction potential and can 
keep this potential till the end of the experiments. Sayles et al. [14] also indicated that the ORP 
decreased rapidly from 200 mV to around -300 mV and remained low for the duration of the 
dechlorination experiments of DDT, DDD, and DDE with zero-valent iron. 
The pH value was maintained as 6 in a solution containing only HCB (Figure 3.1-5). The pH 
value increased with time during the reduction of HCB by both nanoscale Fe and nanoscale Pd/Fe 
bimetallic particles. The pH increased with time in all the experiments using zero-valent iron to 
dehalogenate halogenated compounds without buffering [14, 31]. In most cases, the pH increased 
to nearly 8 and remained at around 8~9 [14, 31, 32]. The pH values rose for the reduction of HCB 
with consuming H+ ions. The inactive surface might be produced after the reduction reactions 
discussed above due to this pH change. The increment in pH by using nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic 
particles was slightly higher than that by using nanoscale Fe particles. It seems that the more 
reduction of HCB with nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles, the more the consumption of H+ ions 
will be.  
 
3.1.3. Reduction of HCB Byproducts with NZVI and Pd/Fe Particles 
Figures 3.1-6 and 3.1-7 showed all measurable byproducts with time during the HCB 
reduction experiments by nanoscale Fe and nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic particles. Different 
distributions of products were observed by using nanoscale Fe and nanoscale Pd/Fe bimetallic 
particles although the reductions were not complete at the end of these experiments. Some 
portion of unknown products can not be identified with our GC/MS. The poor mass balance was 
also observed in the degradation experiments of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds with 
zerovalent iron [33, 34]. Several other transformation mechanisms of chlorinated compounds 
with zero-valent iron have been investigated under different conditions. The oxidation process 
has been reported in the treatment of pesticides with zero-valent iron in oxygen-rich conditions 
[12]. However, none of the oxidation products were identified during our experiments. The

HCB with nanoscale Pd/Fe was given as 0.23 h-1 but no surface area was provided [47]. Zhu et al.

by NZVI herein were higher than HCB reduction with the commercial microscale ZVI reported 
by Lu et al. [60], but lower than that by Cu/Fe [63] and Pd/Fe [47]. The high reductive ability of 
Cu/Fe and Pd/Fe was attributed to the effect of catalytic metal coated [47, 63]. 
 
3.2.3. Effect of Temperature  
Representative results of the degradation reaction at ambient temperature are shown in 
Figure 3.2-4. A progressively better removal of HCB by NZVI was observed as the temperature 
was increased from 5  to 45 . For the removal efficiency, only around 40% of HCB were ℃ ℃
degraded in 96 h at 5  and 25 . In the℃ ℃  same period of time, more than 60% of HCB were 
degraded by nanoscale ZVI particles at 45 . In the control experiments without iron particles, ℃
the concentration of HCB was quite stable. The similar removal efficiency at 5  and 25  ℃ ℃
indicates that the effect of temperature on the degradation equilibrium of halogenated compounds 
in groundwater is quiet small. The most interesting feature of these plots is the dramatic 
degradation at the end of the experiments achieved with increasing temperature from 25  to ℃
45 . The degradation rate of HCB fits well to the pseudo℃ -first-order kinetics. The degradation 
rate of HCB by the synthesized nanoscale iron particles at 25  is 0.075 h℃ -1 (Fig. 3.2-4). The rate 
constants declined from 0.12 h-1 at 45  to ℃ 0.075 h-1 at 25  and ℃ finally to 0.050 h-1 at 5 . It ℃
clearly suggests that temperature can facilitate the degradation of polychlorinated compounds in 
aqueous solution. 
Applying the Arrhenius equation, the effect of temperature on degradation rates can be 
quantified as: 
  )exp(
RT
E
Ak a−=         (7) 
where k is the degradation rate constant, A is the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is 
ideal gas constant, T is temperature. By plotting ln k versus 1/T, a linear least-square analysis 
with a good regression of 0.99 is shown in Figure 3.2-5. The activation energy of degradation of 
HCB by NZVI was 16.6 kJ mol-1. This value is less than the activation energy of 80.0 kJ mol-1 for 
p-dichlorobenzene with Pd/Fe bimetallic particles [48] and 80.0-102.5 kJ mol-1 for three different 
dichlorobenzene isomers with Pd/Fe catalyst [64], indicating the good reactivity of NZVI and its 
less temperature dependency of its application in the environment. 
 
3.2.4. Effect of pH 
The changes of the HCB concentration at pH 3.2, 5.1, 6.8, 9.2 and 13.0 are presented in 
Figure 3.2-6. Comparing the removal efficiencies of HCB by nanoscale ZVI for the cases of pH 
13.0 and 3.2, the latter had a more than 50 % removal of HCB after a treatment time of around 48 
hours. In the former, however, only about 10 % HCB were degraded even when its treatment time 
was doubled. A possible reason for this phenomenon might be that a lower pH gives rise to a 
greater extent of acid washing of ion oxides on metallic iron surfaces [58]. In nitrate reduction 
reactions with iron powder, the nitrate removal rate also decreased with an increase in pH [65]. 
Moreover, Liu and Lowry [66] showed that decreasing pH from 8.9 to 6.5 resulted in a doubling 
of the observed trichloroethylene reaction rate constant. That is, lowering pH would dissolve 
away ferrous hydroxide and other passive layers at the surface of nanoscale ZVI yielding more 
fresh reactive sites for degradation of HCB. The chemical reduction of polychlorinated aromatic 
compounds by nanoscale ZVI is favorable in acid conditions.  
Pseudo-first-order reaction constants were estimated for HCB reduction by nanoscale ZVI 
particles in different pHs ranging from 0.12 h-1 at pH 3.2 to 0.052 h-1 at pH 9.3 and pH 13.0 
(Table 3.2-1). Apparently, the reaction rate constant increased when the system pH decreased. 
 17
3.2.6. Degradation pathways 
The time course for the transformations of HCB to lower chlorinated benzenes by nanoscale 
ZVI is shown in Figure 3.2-9. Chemical reduction of HCB by ZVI produced decomposition 
products of lower chloro-substituted benzenes mainly compared to those of known congeners in 
analytical reference standards and identified by their mass spectra. The subsequent decomposition 
was found by the identification of n-chloro- to (n-1)-chloro- benzenes with the increasing time of 
reaction. Figure 3.2-9 shows that a rapid dechlorination of HCB was observed during this 
experiment time followed by a gradual decrease. During the initial reaction period of HCB (< 3 
h), pentachlorobenzene was the most abundant byproduct. The concentration of pentachlorobenze 
increased with time and achieved its maximum concentration in 12 h and then slowly decreased 
until the end of the experiment. Tetra- and tri-chloro- benzene were observed after 3 h and 6 h, 
respectively, and then their concentrations increased with time. After 24 h, only a trace of 
1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) was detected. 
The reductive dechlorination by successive loss of chloride atoms is confirmed as the main 
pathway of the degradation of HCB with zerovalent nanoscale iron particles. It is in agreement 
with several reduction studies of chlorinated compounds with zero-valent iron [19, 22, 24]. In the 
reduction of HCB by subcolloidal Ag/Fe particles, Xu and Zhang [61] revealed that 80% 
dechlorination intermediates were presented as TeCBs and TCBs (1,2,4- and 1,3,5-). Only a small 
fraction (~5%) was degraded to end product (DCBs) and PeCB fraction was negligible. Using 
nanoscale Pd/Fe to degrade HCB, three TeCBs and two TCBs (1,2,4- and 1,3,5-) were determined 
as the intermediates during the experiments and the end product was one dichlorobenzene, 
1,4-DCB [47]. Zhu et al. [62] found that HCB was dechlorinated by nanoscale Cu/Fe particles to 
PeCB, three TeCBs, two TCBs (1,2,3- and 1,2,4-), and one DCBs (1,2-DCB) without selectivity 
via a stepwise process. 
 The measured intermediates suggest the pathways in the sequentially reductive 
dechlorination of HCB with nanoscale ZVI. The first step in the reductive transformation of HCB 
is loss of one chlorine atom, resulting in penta-chlorobenzene (PCB). Pentachlorobenzene 
continued dechlorination to form three identified tetrachlorobenzenes (TeCBs) including 
1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene. Two 
identified trichlorobenzenes (TriCBs), 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, were 
observed after the formation of tetrachlorobenzenes. The end product was one dichlorobenzene, 
1,2-DCB. Over time, the extent of dehalogenation became more significant as indicated by the 
increasing concentration and number of less substituted chlorobenzenes. The degradation of HCB 
with NZVI particles occurs through a stepwise reductive dechloronation mechanism. A similar 
sequential dehalogenation trend was also observed in the degradation of polyhalogenated 
aromatic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls with zero-valent ion particles [24]. 
Chlorobenzenes with more chlorination are generally more toxic. For example, the values of the 
half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for diatom (Cyclotella meneghiniana) are 2 μg/L, 8 
μg/L, 1390 μg/L, 2830 μg/L, and 23330 μg/L for HCB, PCB, 1,2,3,4-TeCB, 1,2,4-TCB, and 
1,2-DCB, respectively [73]. After reductive dechlorination reactions, these by-products are less 
toxic than HCB. Furthermore, these lower chloro-benzenes derived from highly chlorinated 
benzenes can be biodegraded or photo-degraded more easily than HCB in the environment. Rapid 
dechlorination of highly chlorinated congeners suggests that nanoscale zerovalent iron can be 
used for remediation of HCB in the environment.

3.3. Effects of Various Ions on the Dechlorination of HCB by NZVI 
3.3.1. Effect of sodium bicarbonate on the degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI particles 
The effect of different concentrations of NaHCO3 on the degradation kinetics of HCB by 
NZVI particles is shown in Figure 3.3-1. Degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI particles in the 
presence of NaHCO3 is similar to that in the absence of NaHCO3. The rate constant and 
degradation efficiency within 72 h in the presence of 7.7 mM NaHCO3 of 0.76 h-1 and 42%, 
respectively, were close to that in the absence of NaHCO3 of 0.75 h-1 and 39% (Table 3.3-1). The 
presence of NaHCO3 had no significant impact on the degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI 
particles. Because the standard reduction potential of Na+ ions (-2.71 V) is less than that of Fe2+ 
ions (-0.44 V), it is believed that Na+ ions have no effect on degradation reactivity of iron metal 
[74]. Therefore, HCO3- had no influence on the degradation of HCB by NZVI particles. Bi et al. 
[39] pointed out that solutions containing bicarbonate, depending on its concentration, can either 
serve to enhance or inhibit iron corrosion and degradation rates of 4-chloronitrobenzene and 
4-chloraniline by granular iron. The enhancement effect is attributed to accelerated corrosion of 
iron in contact with bicarbonate. It is generally accepted that reduction of adsorbed HCO3- on the 
iron metal surface facilitated iron dissolution [75]. In addition, it is suggested that formation of 
FeHCO3+ and Fe(HCO3)2 by complexing the Fe2+ generated during iron corrosion destabilized 
the passive layer and enhanced the corrosion process [76]. The pH buffer action of the 
H2CO3/HCO3- system also contributed to promote iron corrosion [77]. It has been reported that 
bicarbonate accelerates the iron corrosion and degradation reactivity of granular iron toward 
1,1,1-trichloroethane [78], trichloroethylene [79], 1,2,3-trichloropropane, and 1,1-dichloroethane 
[80] at first, but followed by a inhibition in the longer term. Carbonate, from bicarbonate, is 
generally believed to inhibit iron reactivity by precipitating as siderite or iron carbonate 
hydroxides and forming an insulating film on the iron surface [74]. However, the effect of the 
precipitation would only appear at the longer reaction time. Liu et al. [34] reported that effect of 
bicarbonate on reactive nanoscale iron particles (RNIP)-promoted trichloroethylene (TCE) 
dechlorination and H2 Evolution. The RNIP was composed of 48 wt% Fe0 and 52 wt% Fe3O4. 
Bicarbonate had no significant effect on Fe0 corrosion and H2 evolution but decreased RNIP 
reactivity with TCE. The inhibitory effect of bicarbonate on TCE reduction was attributed to 
passivation of reactive sites from anion complexation to hydrous ferric oxide formed on the iron 
surface. In this study, bicarbonate had no significant impact on the degradation kinetics of HCB 
by NZVI particles. The discrepancy results between the literature and our study may be due to the 
different reactivity of NZVI particles toward TCE and HCB. In addition, the Fe0 made up a large 
majority of our NZVI particles while only about 48% Fe0 existed in RNIP. 
 
3.3.2. Effect of sodium nitrate on the degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI particles 
Figure 3.3-2 shows the effect of different concentrations of NaNO3 on the degradation 
kinetics of HCB by NZVI particles. As the NaNO3 concentration increased from 0.8 to 7.7 mM, 
the rate constant decreased from 0.060 to 0.050 h-1, and the degradation efficiency within 72 h 
decreased from 39% to 30% (Table 3.3-1). The higher the NaNO3 concentration, the lower the 
rate constant and degradation efficiency were. The presence of NaNO3 inhibited HCB 
degradation by NZVI particles as compared with that without salts. Nitrate obtains electrons from 
iron surface and reduces to nitrite and ammonia [81]. Nitrate reduction to nitrite and ammonia by 
NZVI was previously reported [82]. The inhibitory effect of nitrate on TCE reduction by iron 
filings resulted from the competition for reactive cathodic sites by Fe0-reducible solutes (NO3-) 
[83, 84]. The competitive process between of HCB with NO3- on NZVI surface in aqueous 
solutions contributes the slow degradation kinetics and low degradation efficiency of HCB. In 
 21
during the column experiment. Their SEM images revealed that most of the Fe0 surface was 
covered by botryoidal-like structures and the EDX results indicated that Mg takes over a portion 
of the Fe composition on the surface. However, in this study, SEM images of NZVI after 
dechlorination reaction have no difference between in the presence of Na2SO4 and MgSO4. These 
results indicated that no magnesium oxide or hydroxide was formed on the iron surface. 
Therefore, the presence of magnesium ions had no inhibitory effect on the degradation of HCB 
by NZVI particles. In addition, the standard reduction potential of Mg2+ ions (-2.372 V) is less 
than that of Fe2+ ions (-0.44 V), it is believed that Mg2+ ions like Na+ ions can not affect reactivity 
of iron metal by reduction of ions. 
 
3.3.6. Effect of ferrous sulfate on the degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI particles 
The influence of various concentrations of FeSO4 on the degradation kinetics of HCB by 
NZVI particles is shown in Figure 3.3-6. The degradation kinetics in the presence of Na2SO4 is 
also presented in Figure 3.3-6 in order to evaluate the differences between the effect of ferrous 
ions and ferrous sulfate. When compared with degradation of HCB without any salts and with the 
same concentrations of Na2SO4, Fe2+ ions inhibit both rate constants and degradation efficiencies. 
The rate constants were 0.073 min-1 at 0.8 mM FeSO4 and 0.071 min-1 at 7.7 mM FeSO4, which 
were lower than that of 0.078 h-1 and 0.087 h-1 in the presence of corresponding Na2SO4 
concentration (Table 3.3-1). As the FeSO4 concentration increased from 0.8 to 7.7 mM, the 
degradation efficiency decreased from 37% to 28%. The inhibitory effect of ferrous ion was also 
observed for other compounds removal with Fe0. Zhu et al. [91] reported that arsenite removal 
was decreased in the presence of Fe2+ because Fe2+ ions suppress arsenite adsorption on NZVI 
surface. It has been reported that TCE degradation rate decreased as the concentration of ferrous 
ion increased. This was due to the formation of passive precipitates of ferrous hydroxide, 
including maghemite and magnetite (Fe3O4) that coated on the surface of iron powder, which as a 
result inhibited the electron transfer and catalytic hydrogenation mechanisms [92]. Shin et al. [93] 
also found Fe2+ produced by iron-reducing bacteria covered the reactive surfaces of iron filings 
and inhibited the reduction of TCE by ZVI. 
 
3.3.7. Effect of copper sulfate on the degradation kinetics of HCB by NZVI particles 
The effect of different concentrations of CuSO4 on the degradation kinetics of HCB by 
NZVI particles is examined (Figure 3.3-7). To discriminate the effect of copper ions from copper 
sulfate, the degradation kinetics in the presence of Na2SO4 is also shown. As compared with 
degradation of HCB at the same concentrations of Na2SO4, the presence of Cu2+ ions enhanced 
both rate constants and degradation efficiencies. The rate constant and degradation efficiency 
within 72 h at 0.8 and 7.7 mM CuSO4 were 0.257 min-1 and 89%, and 0.298 min-1 and 100%, 
respectively (Table 3.3-1). Figure 3.3-8 shows the FE-SEM image and EDS analysis of NZVI 
particles after dechlorination reaction in the presence of copper ion. Although there was no 
distinct difference in FE-SEM image between with and without copper ion, EDS results revealed 
that 0.08 g Cu was deposited on per gram of iron. 
The standard reduction potential of Cu2+ ions (+0.34 V) is well above that of Fe2+ ions (-0.44 
V) and the reduction of Cu2+ ions would be expected to take place primarily via a redox reaction 
[94]. The enhancement effect of the presence of Cu2+ ions on the rate constant of degradation 
kinetics of HCB was attributed to the Cu coating on NZVI particles. It has been reported that the 
presence of a Cu coating enhanced the reaction rates of the dechlorination of some chlorinated 
aliphatics and aromatics. Zheng et al. [95] and Zhu et al. [62] reported that copper-coated iron 
enhanced reactivity on the dechlorination of HCB as compared to iron alone [62, 95]. 
Maithreepala and Doong [96] indicated that the removal of carbon tetrachloride, 
tetrachloroethene, and trichloroethene by chloride green rust was enhanced by the reduction of 
Cu2+ ions to both Cu+ and Cu0. Hou et al. [97] suggested that the improvement of the reduction of 
Cr6+ by Cu2+ on Fe0 might be ascribed to Cu2+ acting as a catalyst or the media of charge transfer 
during the reaction. Shih et al. [29] also found that the deposition of reduced Cu form from 
solutions by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) on NZVI resulted in a significant 
increase in dechlorination of pentachlorophenol by Pd/Fe in presence of Cu2+ ions.

According to the removal of DBDE by zerovalent iron at different initial pHs, the logarithm 
of the DBDE reduction rate constant has a linear relationship with initial pH (Fig. 3.4-4): 
log k = -0.035 pH-1.44    with r2=0.97                    (1) 
The slope of equation (1) can be useful for estimating the potential significance of pH 
variability on observed reaction rates of DBDE. A high regression coefficient shows that the 
DBDE reaction rate with ZVI is a function of the hydrogen ion activity. However, the small 
coefficient of -0.035 indicates that there is a not strong dependence on pH in DBDE removal by 
NZVI. Without the data point at initial pH 5, the regression coefficient is still 0.97 and the slope 
is -0.041. These results are consistent with the results for the reduction of trichlorethylene with 
NZVI by Liu and Lowry (2006). The very weak pH dependency could result from that the rapid 
reaction kinetics on NZVI surface. Our small coefficient suggests that H+ is not a dominant part 
of the rate-determining step of removal of DBDE by NZVI. 
 
3.4.4. Reaction Products 
The transformations of DBDE to lower bromo congeners by NZVI at three different pH 
values are shown in Figs 3.4-5a, 3.4-5b, and 3.4-6a. Chemical reduction of DBDE by ZVI 
produced many decomposition products of lower bromine substituted BDEs that could be 
compared to those of known congeners in analytical reference standards and identified by their 
mass spectra. The protocol used to identify the structural isomer groups herein was reported by 
Bezares-crus et al. (2004).  
Figure 3.4-5a shows the time course for the reduction of DBDE with NZVI at pH 5. Due to 
the presence of octa- and nona-BDEs in the technical DBDE, some of these BDEs were found to 
be present already in the beginning. Söderström et al. (2004) and our previous study (Shih and 
Wang, 2009) also found them at the start of the experiments. During the initial reaction period of 
DBDE (<20 mins), nona-BDEs were still the most abundant byproducts. The small variation of 
nona- and octa-BDEs may result from the fact that they were formed from DBDE degradation 
while similar amounts were degraded to less brominated DEs by NZVI at the same time. Hepta-, 
hexa-, and penta-BDEs were observed after 10, 20, and 30 mins, respectively. Tetra- and 
tri-BDEs were found together after 60 mins. After 90 mins, di- and mono-BDEs were observed. 
The concentrations of these BDEs slowly increased with time. This indicates the debromination 
of PBDEs from octa- to penta-BDEs. The low concentration of these byproducts may result from 
the high reactivity of NZVI in this acid condition. Products with less bromines were probably 
quickly degraded when they were formed. Figure 3.4-5b shows the normalized concentrations of 
byproducts of DBDE after the reaction with NZVI at pH 7. Nona-BDEs were also the most 
dominant congeners and their concentration decreased with time. Less substituted congeners 
appear in succession as the reaction time increases. Hepta- and hexa-BDEs were found after 20 
mins. And then penta-, tetra- and tri-BDEs were observed after 50 mins. Finally, di- and 
mono-BDEs were detected. The percent distributions of hexa- to octa-BDEs increased during the 
experimental time and the percent distributions of hepta-BDEs were even higher than nonabromo 
congeners at the end of the experiment. Figure 3.4-6a shows the normalized concentrations of 
DBDE transformed by NZVI at pH 10. The percent distributions of heptabromo congeners 
rapidly increased before 50 mins, and hepta-BDEs became the most dominant byproducts at the 
end of the experiment. Hexa-BDEs were observed after 50 mins later than previous conditions. 
The concentration of hexa-BDEs slowly increased with time. Only penta-BDEs and no less 
brominated DEs were identified. The difference of byproduct distribution at these three pHs may 
result from the slower reaction rate and the higher amount of debromination byproducts observed.  
The mass balance of the DBDE removal in 120 min was shown in Table 3.4-1. With the 
increase of pH, the residual DBDE fraction and identified debrominated byproduct fraction in 
aqueous phase increased. Only 18% of DBDE were adsorbed on NZVI surface at pH 5. However, 
around 43% of DBDE were adsorbed on NZVI when aqueous pH higher than 7. Less than 0.1% 
was found for the adsorption on glass wall of vials. Adsorption on NZVI plays a role on the 
removal of DBDE due to its high hydrophobicity. The mass balance under pH 10 is much better 
than those under other pH values. In the experiments at other pH values, the recovery tended to 
decrease, reflecting the difficulties in detecting and quantifying the degraded byproducts.

XANES results summarize that the lab-synthesized CMC stabilized-Ni/Fe particles contain 
significantly Fe0 and a small amount of iron oxides. 
 
3.5.2. Effect of iron dosage in CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles  
Figure 3.5-3 shows the effect of CMC-Ni/Fe dosage on degradation kinetics of DBDE by 
CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles. Increasing the dosage of CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles from 1.0 to 10 g/L 
enhanced greatly the degradation efficiency of DBDE. The degradation rate constants under three 
dosages of 1.0 g/L, 5.0 g/L, and 10 g/L were determined to be 0.039, 0.111, and 0.232 min-1, 
respectively. The removal efficiency of DBDE increased from 44 % to 95 % after 60 min of 
reaction when the dosage of CMC-Ni/Fe increased from 1.0 g/L to 10 g/L. However, the CMC to 
Fe molar ratio decreased from 0.0052 to 0.0005 while increasing the iron dosage of CMC-Ni/Fe 
from 1.0 g/L to 10 g/L. He and Zhao [99] pointed out that the reactivity of CMC stabilized 
nanoparticles decreased and further inhibited the degradation rate as the CMC/Fe is too high. 
This observation reveals that accumulation of CMC molecules on the NZVI reactive surface 
unavailable for dehalogenation, thus greatly diminish the CMC-NZVI activity. Saleh et al. [44] 
also shows that the reactivity of monometallic ZVI nanoparticles reduced due to surface coating 
with surfactants and copolymers. 
 
3.5.3. Effect of Ni percentage coating on CMC-Ni/Fe particles 
Rapid degradation of DBDE by CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles was observed in the beginning for 
around 60 minutes. The degradation rate constants under the Ni loadings of 0.5 and 5.0 wt% 
(weight ratio to Fe) were determined to be 0.137 and 0.216 min-1, respectively (Figure 3.5-4). The 
kobs became larger when increase the content of Ni loading. There were number of studies 
demonstrating successful dehalogenation of halogenated compounds like 
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2’bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) [100], para-nitrochlorobenene (p-NCB) 
[101], pentachlorophenol (PCP) [102], carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) [103], polybrominated 
diphenyl ethers [104] by Ni/Fe nanoparticles. The DBDE removal percentage increased from 61 
% to 94 % when Ni loading increased from 0.5 to 5.0 wt %. However, the removal efficiency of 
DBDE was only 20 % when CMC stabilized zerovalent iron (CMC-Fe) reacted with DBDE 
without Ni. The rate constant of DBDE with CMC-Fe was 0.042 min-1 within 60 min. The in-situ 
Fe K-edge XANES spectrum of the NZVI after reaction with DBDE was shown in Figure 3.5-2. 
The pre-edge spectra of Fe in the CMC-Fe and CMC-Ni/Fe were in a similar oxidation state 
between Fe0 and iron oxides before reactions. The oxidation state of CMC-Fe nanoparticles had 
no obvious change after the reaction (Figure 3.5-2b). Ni mostly acted as a catalyst instead of a 
reducing agent, and Fe acted as the reducing agent because of its lower reduction potential [104, 
105]. 
 
3.5.4. Effect of pH 
It is thought that pH strongly affects the debromination of DBDE with CMC-Ni/Fe 
nanoparticles. Figure 3.5-5 shows that the effect of pH on the degradation kinetics of DBDE by 
CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles. The rate constants of DBDE were 0.07, 0.10, and 0.16 min-1 for initial 
pHs of 5, 8.5, and 10, respectively. As compared to the degradation behaviors of these pHs, the 
debromination efficiency decreased with increasing pH. The ζ-potential of CMC increased from 
-30.1 eV to -16.3 eV when pH value decreased from pH 10 to pH 3.4 (Figure 3.5-3), and the 
pHzpc of CMC was about 2.0 [106]. The carboxyl groups of CMC are protonized in acidic 
conditions and this decomposition of the carboxyl cellulose chain may partly influence the 
sorption on Ni/Fe nanoparticles While at a higher pH, the carboxyl groups are fully deprotonized 
and could show higher sorption capacity of CMC [106]. Wang and Wang [107] had the same 
results of effect of pH on CMC molecules. Abdel-Halim et al. [108] also confirmed the CMC as 
stabilizing and efficient reducing agent in alkaline medium. The strongly pH-dependence of 
CMC may induce the tendency of degradation rate of DBDE with CMC stabilized Ni/Fe 
nanoparticles under various solution pH. This special phenomenon for CMC presented an 
opposite trend on the effect of pH on the degradation the NZVI in the literature.

dechlorination rates.  
 
3.5.6.3. Effect of bicarbonate 
The degradation rates of DBDE decreased in the presences of bicarbonate ion and the rates 
increased from 0.15 to 0.20±0.02 min-1 with increasing HCO3- concentration (Figure 3.5-10). 
Previous study has pointed out that solutions containing dissolved carbonate species could either 
inhibit or enhance the degradation rates of ZVI. Bi et al. [39] suggested that acceleration and 
inhibition results are due to the passivating effect of a carbonate mineral phase. At low HCO3-, 
the saturation index of Fe(OH)2(a) is higher than that of siderite (FeCO3(s)), so any precipitation is 
likely to be dominated by the hydroxide phase. This porous surface of (hydr)oxide solids often 
allows for some continued reaction. Also, where the iron hydroxides convert to magnetite (Fe3O4) 
on granular iron, surface reactivity could be maintained. But hydroxide surfaces tend to inhibit 
corrosion if they accumulate greatly on the iron surface. Different mechanisms have also been 
proposed for the corrosive dissolution of NZVI in conduced with aqueous carbonate species. The 
direct reduction of H2CO3 and HCO3- adsorbed on the iron metal surface [113, 114]. 
These inhibition phenomena in reduction rate and removal efficiency for DBDE by 
CMC-Ni/Fe with increased concentration of dissolved HCO3- could result from that the 
precipitation of carbonate precipitation such as siderite (FeCO3) on the metal inhibits the 
reduction reaction [115, 116] 
 
3.5.6.4. Effect of hydrogen phosphate 
The degradation rate constants of DBDE with 1, 5 and 10 mM of HPO4-2 are estimated to be 
0.18, 0.21±0.07, and 0.27±0.02 min-1, respectively (Figure 3.5-11). Comparing with 0.28±0.04 
min-1 of DBDE without anion, 1 mM of HPO42- ion hindered the reaction rate of DBDE for about 
1.6-fold (Figure 3.5-12). Increasing the concentration from 1 to 10 mM of hydrogen phosphate 
ion enhanced the degradation rate of DBDE. Anions could be grouped into three groups 
according to the inhibitory effects on the dehalogenation reactions: (1) formation of a 
adsorption-precipitation passivating species (e.g. HCO3-, SO42-, HPO42- [32, 78, 117, 118]), which 
can block the adsorptive and reductive sites on the Ni/Fe surface; (2) competition for reactive 
cathodic sites (e.g. NO3-, NO2- [82]), which can compete for the reductive sites on the Ni/Fe 
surface; and (3) black the catalyst poisons of Ni on the iron surface (e.g. sulfide and sulfite).  
Common dissolved groundwater electrolytes may affect the reactivity and lifetime of 
CMC-Ni/Fe. An inhibition effect of four anions is observed on CMC-Ni/Fe with a low 
concentration (1 mM) of anions. With increasing ion concentrations and ionic strength, the 
reaction rates of CMC-Ni/Fe particles increase (Figure 3.5-12). Compared with Milli-Q system, 
four common anions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, and HPO42-) in the reaction solution reflect an 
insignificantly enhanced removal rate in the presence of 10 mM concentration of anions in the 
order of NO3-＞MQ water Cl≒ - HPO≒ 42-＞HCO3-. Hoffmann et al. [119] indicated that anions 
over the range of 1 to 10 mM show a Hofmeister series on the sonochemical degradation rates of 
PFOA and PFOS: ClO4- ＞ NO3- Cl≒ - ＞ MQ water ＞ HCO3- SO≒ 42-. However, at 1 mM 
concentration of these electrolytes, all four anions seem to hinder the removal rates of DBDE by 
CMC-Ni/Fe in the order of MQ water＞HPO42- Cl≒ -＞HCO3-＞NO3- (Figure 3.5-12). NO3- and 
HCO3- anions in the reaction solution reflect a significantly diminished removal rate, indicating 
that NO3- and HCO3- anions could reduce the reactivity of CMC-Ni/Fe at low concentration in 
experimental conditions. 
 
3.5.7. Effect of humid acid 
Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was known to interact with NZVI particles [49, 80, 120, 
121]. The degradation kinetics of DBDE is performing by 5.0 g/L of CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticles 
with humic acid in the range of 0.1 to 10 mg/L, as shown in Figure 3.5-13. The DBDE removal 
efficiencies of DBDE were 61 %, 55 %, and 74 % when humic acid concentrations were 0.0, 1.0, 
and 10 mg/L, respectively. The rate constants of removal rate constants were 0.137, 0.096, and 
0.089 min-1 when the HA concentrations were 0.0, 1.0, and 10 mg/L, respectively. With the

processes on NZVI surface. For the reaction rates in soils, Longgang and Lugang soils were used 
to investigate the removal of DBDE with NZVI. The removal rate of DBDE in Longgang soil 
was faster than that in Lugang soil probably due to the lower pH of Longgang soil. After 
reductive debromination reactions of DBDE, lower bromo-DEs derived from highly BDEs can 
biodegrade by microorganisms. Rapid removal of highly brominated congeners suggests that 
NZVI can be used for remediation of PBDEs in the environment. 
DBDE was almost removed from aqueous solutions by CMC-Ni/Fe with 5 g/L iron loading 
in 60 min. The kobs became larger when the content of Ni loading increased. The DBDE removal 
percentage increased from 61 % to 94 % when Ni loading increased from 0.5 to 5.0 wt %, while 
only 20 % for CMC stabilized zero valent iron (CMC-Fe). The rate constants and removal 
efficiencies of DBDE with CMC-Ni/Fe increased when the initial pHs increased from 5 to 10. 
The carboxyl groups of CMC are protonized in acidic conditions and this decomposition of the 
carboxyl cellulose chain may partly decrease the sorption of CMC on Ni/Fe nanoparticles, which 
could result in that the opposite trend on the general effect of pH on dehalogenation with the 
NZVI in the literature. The activated energy of CMC-Ni/Fe nanoparticle was 37.69 kJ/mol. 
Among four common electrolytes, a slight inhibition effect of four anions is observed on 
CMC-Ni/Fe with a low concentration of anions (1 mM). With increasing ion concentrations to 10 
mM, the reaction rates of CMC-Ni/Fe particles increase. Compared with Milli-Q system, four 
common anions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, and HPO42-) in the reaction solutions reflect an insignificantly 
enhanced removal rate in the presence of 10 mM concentration of anions in the order of NO3-＞
MQ water Cl≒ - HPO≒ 42-＞HCO3-. However, at 1 mM of these electrolytes, all four anions seem 
to hinder the removal rates of DBDE by CMC-Ni/Fe in the order of MQ water＞HPO42- Cl≒ -＞
HCO3-＞NO3-. NO3- and HCO3- anions at a low concentration in the reaction solution reflect a 
significantly diminished removal rate of CMC-Ni/Fe. With the concentrations of HA increased, 
the rate constants slightly decreased in the presence of HA due to the complexation between 
humic acid and iron species (generated Fe2+), further more forming surface passivating layers and 
inhibited iron corrosion and reduced the DBDE reduction rate. Finally, these better 
understandings from this study can identify the real removal mechanisms of PBDEs with metal 
nanoparticles, elucidate the environmental effects that result in the different degradation kinetics 
and mechanisms of halogenated organic compounds by nanoscale zero-valent metals, and can be 
used to evaluate the feasibility of nanoscale zero-valent metal technology in these POPs
