Abstract 
Fountain codes, such as Random Linear 
(RL) codes and Luby Transform (LT) codes, can 
be regarded as packet-based codes which are 
utilized to avoid excess retransmission requests 
for multicast communications. High 
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is a 
notorious problem inherently existing in OFDM 
systems. In this paper, we propose to take the 
PAPR constraint into account in the encoding of 
fountain codes for OFDM multicast systems. 
Several designs in generating specific fountain 
codes to solve the PAPR problem in OFDM 
systems are proposed. Compared to other usual 
PAPR reduction methods which need additional 
side information in the physical layer, our 
designs require no additional side information in 
the layer. Moreover, substantial PAPR reduction 
can be obtained without sacrificing the decoding 
performance of fountain codes. Mathematical 
analyses and simulation results verify the 
excellence of our designs. 
 
Keywords: Fountain codes, RL codes, LT codes, 
PAPR. 
 
I. Introduction 
Recently, fountain codes have received 
much attention both in theoretical researches 
[1]-[6] and in practical applications [6]. 
Fountain codes are originally designed with a 
few redundant symbols for reliable transmission 
of data over erasure channels. The codes are 
useful if feedback channels do not exist or are 
not available, which means that no Automatic 
Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) mechanisms 
could be adopted. For multicast

⊕  indicates a bitwise XOR operation. Because 
fountain codes are rateless and streaming 
encodable, it means that the value of n can be 
dynamically increased as long as the system 
wishes to be at anytime. Each column vector in 
the matrix G  has its weight (the number of 
1’s), defined as the degree of the corresponding 
encoded symbol of the codeword. Each row 
vector in the matrix G  has its weight, defined 
as the degree of the corresponding input symbol 
among the K information symbols. The 
communication channel is modeled as an 
erasure channel with erasure probability e  so 
that the expectation number of unerased 
received symbols will be equal to )1(* en − . 
The decoding of an RL code is usually done by 
using Gaussian Elimination (GE). Successful 
decoding can be obtained as long as a submatrix 
subG , formed from the generator matrix nKG ×  
by erasing its columns corresponding to the 
erasure positions of the received symbols, has 
its rank equal to K. Note that the decoding 
complexity of GE is )( 3KO . 
 
2) Luby Transform Codes 
The second class of fountain codes 
invented by Luby is LT codes. The information 
vector ( )Kuuu ,,, 21 L=u  is encoded into an 
LT codeword ( ) LGuv == nvvv ,,, 21 L  , where 
][ TLnTL2TL1L g,,g,gG L=  and the components 
of TLig  are not randomly generated but done 
according to the probability density function 
(p.d.f.) of a specific weight distribution called 
Robust Soliton Distribution (RSD). The reason 
for choosing RSD is referred to [1]. Two 
parameters c  and δ  are necessary to have 
KKcS )ln( δ=  to formulate RSD. The p.d.f. 
of RSD, )(dµ , has the following relationships,

Consider a bipartite Tanner graph [11] as 
shown in Fig.1. A bipartite Tanner graph 
consists of the information symbol party (the 
circles), the encoded symbol party (the squares) 
and the connecting edges between them. The 
neighbors of a symbol in one party are those 
symbols in another party with connecting edges 
to it. The number of neighbors of a symbol is 
the degree of this symbol. The encoding process 
based on how to construct the connecting edges 
in the Tanner graph is described in the 
following. The process including four steps 
begins by initially setting j = 1. 
(1). For the jth encoded symbol jv , generate 
a degree d at random from the 
distribution.

PAPR value with CCDF derived in (6). The goal 
in our design is to encode an RL or an LT 
codeword in which every symbol iv  has its 
( )yCCDF ovi )( , as small as 
possible Nifor ≤≤1, . 
A. Random Linear Codes 
(a). Symbol-wise SLM scheme 
The codeword ( )nvvv ,,, 21 L=v  is 
encoded from ( )Kuuu ,,, 21 L=u  via the 
relationship uGv = , where 
][ TnT2T1 g,,g,gG L=  and Tig  is a column 
vector, each element of which is chosen to be 
1’s or 0’s with equal probability. If each of the N 
components { }iii uNuu XXX ,,, 21 L  of an OFDM 
symbol iu  is uniformly distributed over the 
signal constellation such as PSK or QAM, then 
each Tigu=iv  after an RL encoding will also 
have its N components { }iii vNvv XXX ,,, 21 L  to 
be uniformly distributed over the signal 
constellation. In this case the encoded symbol 
iv  maintains the same PAPR performance 
while compared to each iu . We have to adopt 
some technique to reduce the probability of high 
PAPR.  
An SLM method is often used to reduce 
PAPR for OFDM systems. The main idea of it is 
to scramble the orders or the phases of the set of 
complex data before they are fed into the IFFT 
module as shown in Fig. 2. The number of 
scramblers could be more than one (e.g., Q) so 
that one of the Q possible candidates may be the 
transmitted OFDM symbol. The transmitter 
chooses the candidate which PAPR value is the 
smallest among them. The scramblers are 
implemented in the physical (PHY) layer and 
the receiver always needs additional side 
information indicating which candidate is 
chosen. Similar idea is proposed in our design 
as stated in the following. Remember that the 
generation of Tig  is determined by randomly 
choosing 1’s and 0’s for its elements. We may 
repeat Q times such a generation when we 
encode iv  and then we select the one with the 
smallest PAPR value to generate the encoded 
symbol via Tigu=iv . Accordingly, the PAPR 
performance of the OFDM system will be as 
well as the one adopting the SLM method in the 
physical layer. Refer to (6) by replacing x with 
iv , the CCDF of PAPR of iv  is

The scheme is named as a symbol-wise 
SLM scheme. Different from the conventional 
SLM scheme adopted in the PHY, the 
symbol-wise SLM scheme is adopted in the 
medium access control (MAC) layer because 
the side information indicates which 
information symbols that participate the 
formation of the encoded symbol iv , i.e., the 
1’s positions of Tig . The weight of 
T
ig  is 
actually the numbers of the participating 
information symbols. The side information 
about the 1’s positions is hided in the packet 
header that should be always well protected. 
Note that, even without any PAPR reduction 
scheme for a fountain code based multicast 
system, the side information indicates which 
information symbols that participate the 
formation of the encoded symbol iv  should 
 7 
because it encodes a group of p coded symbols 
at a time whereas the scheme A-(a) encodes a 
coded symbol one after one. Note that the larger 
p is, the better performance is obtained. An 
example with Q = 8 and 51 ≤≤ p  is shown in 
Fig.6. In another point of view, we are also 
interested in how many candidates m 
(equivalently means the computation 
complexity) in the scheme A-(b), where the p 
coded symbols are chosen from, could be 
reduced to while its PAPR performance could 
keep approximately at least the same as the 
scheme A-(a)’s. By setting (9) less than or 
approximately equal to (7), we have

One method to find the value of m in (10) 
is calculated numerically if m is not too large. 
Another method to find the value of m could be 
help through normal approximation [14] since 
( )yCCDF bRL _  is binomial distributed. The 
results of an example are also shown in Fig.6. 
The scheme A-(b) with p = 5 and m = 40 has 
similar PAPR performance as the scheme A-(a) 
with Q = 16 at the threshold y = 8 dB. It means 
that if we encode five symbols at a time for the 
scheme A-(b), the number of possible candidates 
for an encoded symbol in average is equal to 
m/p = 8 which is a half of that of the scheme 
A-(a) and hence the complexity is half reduced. 
   
B. LT Codes 
Both the derivations of (a). Symbol-wise 
and (b). Multisymbol-wise SLM schemes are 
similar to III-A and omitted here. 
 
IV. Simulations and Conclusions 
In this paper, we consider that an OFDM 
system is with N = 256 subcarriers, each of 
which carries QPSK modulated data (2-bit data) 
for simplicity. The information symbol iu  or 
the encoded symbol jv  is composed by 512 
bits, where NjKi ≤≤≤≤ 1and1 . For the 
sake that our concern is mainly focused on the 
calculation of their PAPR values, we do not 
adopt any channel coding in the simulation. The 
number of information packets K is set to be 
200 or 1000. The length of an RL or LT 
codeword n is equal to ( ) K⋅+ξ1 . Two 
parameters c and δ  which affect the decoding 
performance of LT codes are respectively 0.1 
and 0.5. We consider the channel erasure 
probability 0=e here because it is uncorrelated 
in calculating the PAPR performance. The 
parameter ξ  represents the redundancy 
fraction of a codeword. 
A. PAPR Peformance 
The analytical and simulated CCDFs of 
PAPR for the scheme A-(a) of RL codes under 
various values of Q are illustrated in Fig.3. The 
CCDF curve of Q =1 represents the original RL 
code without considering the PAPR constraint, 
which is the same as that of an ordinary OFDM 
system. The reason is that the XOR operation 
does not change the uniformly distributed 
statistics of the data. Increasing the value of Q 
gains the better PAPR performance as the 
predicted phenomenon by using the 
symbol-wise SLM mechanism. The PAPR 
performance of the scheme A-(b) is also 
illustrated in Fig.3 by choosing p = n, which 
means all the n coded symbols are chosen at a 
time from the nQ ⋅  candidates. As expected, 
the scheme A-(b) outperforms the scheme A-(a).  
 9 
schemes are adopted in the medium access 
control (MAC) layer where the side information 
indicates which information symbols that 
participate the formation of the encoded symbol. 
The side information about the 1’s positions is 
hided in the packet header that should be always 
well protected. Note that, even without any 
PAPR reduction scheme for a fountain code 
based multicast system, the side information 
indicates which information symbols that 
participate the formation of the encoded symbol 
should still occupy spaces in the packet header. 
In other words, it is quite a good cross layer 
design that does not require additional side 
information in the physical layer while a 
conventional SLM scheme does. The 
computation complexity remains the same as 
that of a conventional SLM scheme. As a 
conclusion, to take PAPR constraint into 
account in the design of fountain codes is a new 
interesting topic that not yet to be fully 
explored.
