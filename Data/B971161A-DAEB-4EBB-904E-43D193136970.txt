methods are identical. The DQ has been used to 
solve many problems [4]. Because only 
problems having simple regular domains and 
under simple external environment can be 
solved by using the DQ,  the application of this 
method is very limited. The DQ can be 
generalized which results in obtaining the 
generic differential quadrature (GDQ) [5]. The 
weighting coefficients for a grid model defined 
by a coordinate system having arbitrary 
dimensions can also be generated. The 
configuration of a grid model can be arbitrary. 
In the GDQ, a certain order derivative  or 
partial derivative of the variable function with 
respect to the coordinate variables at a node is 
expressed as the weighted linear sum of the 
values of function and/or its possible derivatives 
or partial derivatives at all nodes. DQ and GDQ 
have also been extended which results in the 
extended differential quadrature (EDQ) [6,7]. 
For the EDQ discretization, the node and 
discrete point can be different, while for the DQ 
and GDQ discretizations the node and    
discrete point are the same. 
The author has proposed the DQEM for 
solving a generic engineering or scientific 
problem having an arbitrary domain 
configuration [3]. Like the finite element 
method (FEM), in this method the analysis 
domain of a problem is first separated into a 
certain number of subdomains or elements.  
Then the DQ or GDQ discretization is carried 
out on an element-basis.  The governing 
differential or partial differential equations 
defined on the elements, the transition 
conditions on inter-element boundaries and the 
boundary conditions on the analysis domain 
boundary are in computable algebraic forms 
after the DQ or GDQ discretization.  By 
assembling all discrete fundamental equations 
the overall algebraic system can be obtained 
which is used to solve the problem.  The 
interior elements can be regular.  However, in 
order to solve the problem having                                      
an arbitrary analysis domain configuration 
elements connected to or near the analysis 
domain boundary might need to be irregular.  
The mapping technique can be used to develop 
irregular elements.  It results in the DQEM [3]. 
The GDQ can also be used to develop the 
irregular elements.  It results in the GDQEM 
[8]. There is also a discrete element analysis 
technique QEM which also adopts the DQ. The 
original QEM was proposed to solve truss and 
frame structures [9]. In this method, the truss 
element is limited to a three-node second-order 
approximation, while  aδ-grid  arrangement  
is used  to  define  the DQ discretization of 
the flexural deformation. The δ -grid is 
designed to approximately define certain 
boundary conditions at a point close to the 
boundary, and certain inter-element transition 
conditions at a certain point close to the 
inter-element boundary. Consequently, the 
definition of boundary conditions and 
inter-element boundary conditions is 
inconsistent. When developing the plane stress 
and plate bending QEM models, Striz et al 
adopted a hybrid technique to incorporate the 
DQ discretization into a Galerkin finite element 
formulation and define a discrete element 
analysis procedure [10]. The author has also 
proposed a differential quadrature finite 
difference method (DQFDM) [11]. The DQ or 
GDQ is used to derive the finite difference 
operators. For a specified DQFDM grid with a 
specified number of grid points, the order of DQ 
or GDQ  approximation for deriving the finite 
difference operators defined at a discrete point 
in a discrete element or a subdomain can be 
flexible. Different orders of derivatives existing 
in the fundamental equations can have different 
orders of DQ or   GDQ approximations. It is 
different from the DQEM and GDQEM in 
which the orders of  DQ or GDQ 
approximations for all orders of   derivatives 
defined in an element are unique. The 
approximate analytical functions in a DQEM 
and GDQEM element always span over the 
whole element.  Higher order DQFDM
