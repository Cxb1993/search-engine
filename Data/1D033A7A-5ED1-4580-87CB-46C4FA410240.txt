fast DSP chip, in order to obtain better precision. 
In this plan, we set up the bioelectrical impedance 
spectrometer and tomography (BEIS&T) system combined 
with the application of EIS and EIT. Two techniques 
have several advantages including non-invasiveness, 
high-speed monitoring, inexpensive, portable and 
capability of providing functional information. The 
system has several characteristics: (1) Realizing 
digit demodulation by DSP chip. (2) Implementing the 
algorithm of weighted back projection based on the 
DSP chip for real-time imaging. (3) Implementing the 
iterative algorithm combined NOSER with FEM to 
reconstruct tomography image. (4) Designing the 
micro-tomography electrode, it can be used for the 
EIS and EIT. Moreover the database about the EIS and 
EIT parameters of the oral cavity tumor tissue will 
be established.

Abstract
According to the new vital statistical report of cancer deaths of Department of Health in Taiwan, 
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for the fourth leading cancer deaths in Taiwanese 
male population. But OSCC patients up to more than 90% are men. It is easy to use survey device to 
detect. So OSCC become our main study target in the plan. The thesis carried out at present have 
already set up the technology of the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the impedance and 
characteristic parameters between two electrodes can be measured. In this plan, we utilize the 
electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technology and the probe with multi-electrode to obtain the 
impedance between any two electrodes and the tomography image including impedance information, 
simultaneously. It offers us another useful parameter. So we integrate the technology of EIT real-time 
imaging with the EIS technology built before. The analog demodulation method used before is 
replaced with the digital demodulation implemented in fast DSP chip, in order to obtain better 
precision. In this plan, we set up the bioelectrical impedance spectrometer and tomography (BEIS&T) 
system combined with the application of EIS and EIT. Two techniques have several advantages 
including non-invasiveness, high-speed monitoring, inexpensive, portable and capability of 
providing functional information. The system has several characteristics: (1) Realizing digit 
demodulation by DSP chip. (2) Implementing the algorithm of weighted back projection based on the 
DSP chip for real-time imaging. (3) Implementing the iterative algorithm combined NOSER with 
FEM to reconstruct tomography image. (4) Designing the micro-tomography electrode, it can be 
used for the EIS and EIT. Moreover the database about the EIS and EIT parameters of the oral cavity 
tumor tissue will be established.

Abstract—Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technology belongs to the functional imaging 
technologies. The EIT technique has several advantages, such as noninvasiveness, affordability, portability, 
and capabilities for high-speed monitoring and providing functional information. By contrast, electrical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a technology for obtaining bio-impedance measurements at different 
frequencies. This method has been used in many medical inspection studies. Hence, the purpose of this 
project was to set up a real-time EIT system. The system is modular, containing a digital sine waveform 
generator (with 0o and 90o phases), current generators with controller, a digital demodulator, an image 
reconstruction, and a simulation tank. Moreover, three image reconstruction algorithms were developed for 
the system software; including the weighted back-projection method and Newton's one-step estimated 
reconstruction algorithm. A high-speed DSP module (TMS320F28335) was utilized for obtaining voltage 
measurements by digital demodulation. The algorithms for the analysis and image reconstruction were 
implemented by another DSP module (TMS320C6713) to achieve the real-time goal. For the finished system, 
a correlation test indicated a highly linear relationship between the measured value and the actual value. Then, 
impedance values were measured at 0° or 90° and the cross-sectional image was reconstructed. When the 
separately placed copper target and Teflon target were tested, the cross sections of the electrical impedance 
tomography were obtained. In addition, the system is supported by a graphical user interface to extract and 
analyze the electrical impedance data as well as reconstruct the image. 
Keywords: Electrical Impedance Tomography, Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy, Digital demodulation 
1. Introduction  
Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a technique for producing an image of the cross-sectional 
impedance within an object by applying currents while measuring the voltages at the boundary [1]. There are 
both the resistivity and permittivity distributions in the impedance image. In addition, EIT is different from 
the image modalities currently available in clinics, such as X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging, emission computed tomography, and sonography. This technique can provide additional 
information on tissues under diagnosis. In comparison with computed tomography, EIT offers the merits of 
low cost, no radiation, and noninvasiveness. Several research groups have published reports about the EIT 
system [2,3]. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a scanning frequency measurement system that can 
provide more useful information about tissues and cells. Researchers conduct EIS studies in vivo for human 
tissues such as those of the bladder, skin, stomach, and breast. If electrical impedance were not used, there 
would be no choice but to perform a biopsy or use traditional imaging. Measurements from EIS and other 
technologies have been compared. The method is regarded as a better assessment tool than the traditional 
imaging method [4]. Some investigators even attempt to regard the method as a clinical diagnostic tool [4,5]. 
Other researchers have discussed how both the imaginary part and real part of the measured signal include 
some physiological and pathological information about the biological target. In this study, a combined EIS 
and EIT system is developed. The system utilizes the technology of direct digital synthesis (DDS) in the sine 
signal generator with phase-varying function. A voltage controlled current source with an enhance Howland 
circuit is used [6]. Two digital signal processors (DSPs) that possess high-speed computing capability are 
employed as kernels of demodulation and image reconstruction, respectively. This system supports two

The impedance measurement procedure applies a known current to the object with unknown impedance. 
The demodulation techniques are used to estimate the amplitude of the measured signal. In comparison with 
the traditional analog type of amplitude demodulation, the digital demodulation reduces the distortion of 
the signal by nonlinearity, DC drift, and noises. The processing can be realized inside the digital signal 
processor by multiplying the measured signal. 
2.3. Reconstruction Algorithm 
In general, there are two methods for solving the forward problem. One is the analytical method, and the 
other is the finite element method (FEM). The latter method is practical to represent the inhomogeneous or 
homogeneous media within the body. In addition, the purpose is to simplify the nonlinear governing equation 
into a system of linear algebraic equations. Hence, the finite element method is typically used in the iterative 
reconstruction algorithm. The aim of the reconstruction algorithm is to solve the inverse problem of the 
Laplace equation for the distribution of resistance within a region. Several techniques have been used to 
reconstruct the conductivity or resistivity distributions. In this project, the system utilizes three methods, 
including weighted back-projection and Newton one-step estimated reconstruction (NOSER). These are 
iteratively implemented as reconstruction algorithms by the system. By making a weighted back-projection 
reconstruction, the dynamical or relative image distribution is obtained, and the method supports a high 
frame rate for images. According to several research documents, however, the Newton-Raphson method has 
been found superior for obtaining the absolute image distribution. Thus, an algorithm based upon the 
Newton-Raphson method was used for image reconstruction. In fact, this iterative algorithm involves both 
forward and inverse algorithms. The NOSER method is employed to obtain the best initial estimate of the 
resistivity distribution inside the object. Then, the calculated distribution is mapped onto the mesh of the 
finite element method in order to acquire the resistivity of each element. The least-squares method is applied 
to monitor the differences between the boundary voltages from FEM computations and real measurements. 
2.4. Software design 
The system provides two functions, which are electrical impedance spectroscopy and electrical 
impedance tomography. Therefore, the system offers users a graphical user interface by which to manage its 
operation. Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the system program implemented using Visual C#. For this study, 
we took a left semicircle of a Cole-Cole plot from measurements at higher frequency. The k items of 
resistance (R) and reactance (X) were obtained for different frequencies. The least-squares method was 
employed to perform iterative fitting computations. The k items of the measurements were substituted into 
the iterative formula. The error function attained the convergence condition of (rn·0.0001)2. Approximations 
for x0, y0, and r were thus obtained and were subsequently used to derive the four characteristic parameters.

4. Conclusions 
The system developed can measure both the real and imaginary parts of impedance at any frequency 
ranging from 100 Hz to 100 kHz. The system uses thirty-two drive/receive electrodes to support two 
acquisition protocols, which are the adjacent and adaptive methods. The acquisition module is connected to a 
host PC through a high-speed USB interface. According to the results, the current source based on a direct 
digital synthesis circuit can produce a current signal with a mean THD of 0.91% at frequencies ranging from 
1 kHz to 100 kHz. In the test for a pure resistance ranging from 0  to 1 k at three frequencies, the squares 
of the correlation coefficients were greater than 0.998. The load circuit included a resistance of 100 , 330 , 
or 510 , with a capacitance variable from 1 nF to 0.47 F in parallel. At frequencies of 1 kHz, 10 kHz, and 
100 kHz, a highly linear relationship between the measurements and the commercial LCR meter was 
obtained. Irrespective of the real or imaginary part, the R2 values were greater than 0.988. Adopting the 
adjacent excitation strategy, the system was used to measure voltages from adjacent electrodes on the 
boundary. Therefore, the digital signal processors (DSPs) with high-speed computing capability were 
utilized as kernels for demodulation. At the same time, the system communicated with a PC via a USB 
interface and offered its graphical user interface on the PC. Using the DSP demodulator for calculations, the 
bioelectrical impedance information and EIS characteristics were obtained. In terms of the EIT aspect, back-
projection can be used to reconstruct the images. The cross-sectional images of electrical impedance can be 
obtained for several frequencies at 0° and 90°. The system was tested using two simulation tanks; one is a 
miniature tank and the other is a normal tank. The system also provides a graphical user interface to extract 
electrical impedance information, analyze data, and reconstruct images. The impedance values are measured 
at 0° or 90° and then a cross-sectional image can be reconstructed. When the separately placed copper target 
and Teflon target were tested, the cross sections of the electrical impedance tomography were obtained. In 
addition, the system supports the friendly graphic user interface was also provided for the convenience of the 
user to extract the electrical impedance data, analyze and reconstruct image.
