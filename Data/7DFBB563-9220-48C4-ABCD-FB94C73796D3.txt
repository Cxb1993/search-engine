1摘 要
首先，為了確認直接數值模擬的可靠性，目前於文獻中選定 Sato 的實驗(Sato, 1960)作比
對。在所選定的某一噴流情況下，就噴流之線性成長率與其反對稱性的 eigenfunction 模態而
言，使用”random broad-band white noise”直接數值模擬的結果與 Sato 的實驗相當吻合。進一
步的探討後，直接數值模擬亦發現 Sato 文獻中所提：不穩定成長的噴流，於下游某一定距離
處，因其上下流線的收縮而產生流速增強之現象。該”squeeze”現象(本文稱之)亦經由直接數
值模擬加以詳細研討與說明其效應(Sato 文獻中僅提及該現象但未詳加說明原由及效應)。然
後，吾人發現，於”squeeze”現象期間，紊流能量竟是以逆向方式回溯至平均流速。
另一方面，吾人亦依據直接數值模擬在 5.01M 的結果，初步地建議一組簡易之紊流模
式，以便將來搭配 FANS (Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes)方程式而使用於大尺度結構(large-scale
structure)的可壓縮噴流之應用。目前，正進行 0.11M 、 5.1 與 0.2 的直接數值模擬計算，以
便建立具有馬赫數(Mach numbers)效應之前述簡易紊流模式。鉤勒出具馬赫數效應之簡易紊
流模式，將是一件很有趣且具挑戰性的研究工作。
吾人相信是非常值得在超級電腦上執行高解析度的運算，以期能更進一步的瞭解可壓縮
性噴流之混合特性；甚至可初步瞭解其非線性混合後之先期紊流現象是如何形成；這對可壓

ABSTRACT
The results of DNS (direct numerical simulations) in comparison with Sato’s experiment (Sato,
1960) at the chosen case have revealed a good agreement with regards to the linear growth rates of
the jet instabilities and the anti-symmetric eigenfunctions as well. Moreover, a “squeeze”
phenomenon, which was found to have shrinkage in two dividing streamlines at the particular
downstream distance in Sato’s experiment, was depicted in more details using DNS. It was then
found that in the “squeeze”process turbulent kinetic energy feeds back energy to mean flow in a
reversal way.
On the other hand, a simple turbulence model was preliminarily proposed for the case of
5.01 M , based upon the results of DNS. It is quite interesting and challenging to further establish
the modified turbulence models that adopt the affecting of the Mach numbers, for instance,
0.11 M , 5.1 , 0.2 , and so on.
Continuing research requires the supports of large calculations run on the supercomputers in
order to provide valuable information from the transitional region to turbulence in the confined
compressible jet flows. As a result, this will shed lights on understanding the turbulence modeling
in compressible jet flows.
Key words: Compressible Jet Flow, Numerical Simulation, Transition to Turbulence, Turbulence
Model.

一、前言
Instability of jet evolution is always attractive and
full of mystery. It was found in the experiments,
e.g., Sato (1960), Rockwell and Niccolls (1972),
Weir, etc. (1981), Browne, etc. (1984), Thomas and
Prakash (1991), Meyer, etc. (2001), Alkislar, etc.
(2003), and so on, that a planer jet exhibits
symmetric instability (say “varicose”type) in the
initial stage; however, in the further downstream
evolution, the jet flow then dramatically switches to
asymmetric instability (called “sinuous”mode).
As pointed out by Thomas and Prakash (1991), the
occurring of such anti-symmetric instability modes
was further found to be near the exit of nozzle, but
was not caused by any source upstream of the
nozzle exit, e.g., duct resonance, blower pulsation,
etc. A reasonable presumed scenario was
considered to the effects of feedback from the
downstream perturbation associated with the first
vortex-paring in jet shear layer. And, for the
planar jet if the shear layers undergo lateral spatial
oscillation similar to Bio-Savart induction from an
unsteady dipole, and then the resultant longitudinal
velocity fluctuations would be considered to be
anti-symmetric with respect to the jet centerline, in
which case it enhances the occurring of
anti-symmetric modes. Furthermore, DNS (direct
numerical simulations) by Huang and Tsai (2007),
utilizing random white noise excitation to animate
kinds of “natural”experiment at different Mach
numbers, Mc = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, for rather low
Reynolds numbers, also indicated the jet flow
instabilities were dominated by the anti-symmetric
modes.
For the axisymmetric air jet instability, Petersen and
Samet (1988) indicated that by implication there is
no a single preferred mode. The most amplified
shear layer instability depends upon streamwise
location and on the streamwise distribution of
shear-layer thickness.
Other interesting study of jet flows can be found in
the literature such as Antonia, etc. (1986), Hussain
(1986), Thomas and Brehob (1986), Thomas and
Chu (1989), Hu, etc. (2000), Hu, etc. (2001), Sadr
and Klewicki (2003), and so on.
For the evolution of compressible jet flows,
theoretical analysis has mainly been restricted to
linear stability analysis and small perturbation
approach, refer to Mattingly and Criminale (1971),
Petersen and Samet (1988). Consequently,
numerical simulations have raised great interest
because of their capability to treat strongly
nonlinear problems in the transition process and
perhaps to deal with turbulence itself, for example,
research stated in Lesieur (2005), Freund (1999),
Freund, etc (2000) and so on.
At the present time numerical simulations in
compressible jet flows within confined walls were
preliminarily studied by Huang and Tsai (2007),
Huang etc. (2008). Numerical algorithm utilizing
spectral scheme was also constructed and achieved
for medium to low resolutions run at local
computers. A fast chemical reaction model with
infinite rate chemistry was introduced in order to
provide a better understanding of the evolution of
jet flow instabilities and mixing process. The
results at medium resolutions, excited by the
random-broadband white noise in a sense of a
“natural experiment,”are further discussed. The
prior results, Huang and Tsai (2007), strongly
indicated that it is worthy in continuing for high
resolutions run at supercomputers in order to shed
light on the investigation of mixing characteristics
in compressible jet flows.
On the other hand it is desirous to extend the study
from the transitional stage to turbulence in order to
gain the knowledge of how energy being transferred
among those characteristic modes, how energy
being cascaded from large eddies to small ones,
what Reynolds stress being changed during these
stages, and what kinds of turbulence models being
likely proposed, etc. Moreover, a turbulence
model will be proposed in utilizing the FANS
equations. It is also our intention to compare the
results of direct numerical simulations and the
FANS equations associated with the proposed
turbulence model(s) with the experiments in the
literature.
二、內容
The compressible Navier-Stokes equations in
the conservation form coupling with two species
with infinite-rate chemical reaction are utilized in
simulating the jet flows. The spectral scheme is
used as the numerical algorithm in space and a
second-order Adam-Bashforth method in time.
The detailed numerical algorithm and its validation
used on direct numerical simulations were
described by Huang (1992) (also the author of this
project).
As described in Fig 1, the domain is assumed
to be periodic in both streamwise (X-) and spanwise
(Z-) directions, while there are upper and lower
walls confining the growth of jet flows. The mean

growth rate of the linear stability theory. Further
comparison with Sato’s data, see Fig 3, indicates a
good agreement with the experiment. Moreover,
as shown in Fig 4, the rms (root-mean-square) of
u-fluctuations taken the conventional average over
the X-Z domain also reveals a fairly good match
with the intensity of u-fluctuations measured by
Sato’s experiment and its theoretical calculation.
However, from the results of DNS only
anti-symmetric modes are found to be dominant for
the case studied with 5.01 M , referring to Fig 5
for the species concentration in streamwise/
cross-stream sections at different time series,
although Sato revealed that there existed both
symmetrical and anti-symmetrical instability modes
at particular frequencies excited. It would be
quite interesting to see how the jet flow develops
with the excitation of eigenfunctions of both
symmetric and anti-symmetric modes from linear
stability theory, in which case it is one part of this
continued study.
Secondly, Fig 6 describes the curve of
22
0 / peakUU with respect to time, in which peakU is
the maximum mean velocity obtained at the center
line of jet at different time steps. If one could
assume the stabilities of the large structure in a
spatial jet move downstream with a corresponding
disturbance phase speed, rc , in temporal case, i.e.,
tcx r , (4)
the tendency of 22
0 / peakUU versus time in temporal
case could correspond to 22
0 / peakUU with respect to
hx 2/ for a spatial jet. It is commonly observed
in spatial jets that the curve of 22
0 / peakUU had a
constant value in the initial stage but then develop
into a proportional relationship to hx 2/ as the
distance downstream increase. Nevertheless, as
mentioned in Sato’s paper, it was noticed that, at the
transition region, two dividing streamlines starting
from the edge of the slit shrink at about 82/ hx
for the case of SLIT 6 mm L with sec/0.100 mU  .
Such shrinkage of streamlines means an
acceleration of the flow in this particular stage of jet
instability development. However, Sato didn’t
include further investigation regarding this point.
The results of Fig 6 from DNS reveal this point as
well: 22
0 / peakUU maintains flat until time is about 50
(T=50), then increase the slope to be roughly
constant ( 07.0 ). However, during T=70 and 80
the curve drops, meaning the increase of the jet
mean velocity at the center of jet column, and then
it increases again after T=80 with the similar
previous constant slope ( 07.0 ). Further
examination the relationship of hb / versus time
as depicted in Fig 7, where b represents the
half-width of streamwise mean velocity at
peakU2
1 ,
also reveals the similar tendency as that of
22
0 / peakUU with respect to time.
The contraction of jet streamlines could not
be justified clearly by referring to the evolution of
species concentration as shown in Fig 5. With this
in mind, the streamwise mean velocity, )(yu , is
calculated and indicated in Fig 8 for the different
time record. Thus, it shows that the streamwise
mean velocity decays its magnitude as time step
increases except that, at T=75 and 80, the mean
flow increases the velocity magnitude at the central
region of jet core instead. Another interesting
result was found in Fig 9 by examining the
averaged mean pressure, )( yp , at different time
record. The negative mean pressure distribution
sustains as time evolves unless, during the period of
increasing streamwise mean velocity at the central
core, the mean pressure increases by about
maximum 14% of the initial ambient pressure.
Such increasing in both streamwise mean velocity
and mean pressure is likely to be referred as
“squeeze”phenomenon during the evolution of jet
instabilities at the transition to turbulence.
To further understand where the energy
comes from to cause such a“squeeze”phenomenon,
the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy along the
cross-stream direction is plotted at different time
record. As indicated in Fig 10, the intensity of
turbulent kinetic energy,
   ),(),(),(
2
1 222 tywtyvtyu  , (5)
usually increases as the jet instabilities evolve with
respect to time. However, during the “squeeze”
period, say T=75 and 80, the turbulent kinetic
energy decreases thereby, in which case the drop of
energy might reach its maximum by nearly 20%.
Therefore, in the process of jet instabilities being
involved with“squeeze”phenomenon, for example,
anti-symmetric modes for the case studied,
turbulence drains energy to the mean flow in a
reversal way. Whether it is caused by the mutual
collapse of large-scale structure (mixing cores at the
jet boundaries), or by some kinds of
“communication” (or mechanism) developed
among anti-symmetric instabilities modes before
the threshold to turbulence, is an interesting topics
