Zn)等奈米陰極粉末。由 XRD 圖可發現 La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8M0.2O3-δ (M=Fe, Mn, Cu , Zn; LSCF, 
LSCM, LSCCu and LSCZ)粉末經 800℃煆燒後，其主要晶相為 LaCoO3 (Cubic, JCPDS 
75-0279) 鈣鈦礦結構。隨著煆燒溫度升高至 950℃以上，其晶相轉變為 La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 
Hexagonal 結構(JCPDS 36-1393)。而 LSCCu 及 LSCZ 陰極粉末有 LaSrCoO4 (Tetragonal,

89-0510)相存在。由 SEM 表面型態圖可發現 LSCF、LSCM、LSCZ 之粒徑大小皆小於 1μ

Abstract 
In this study, the nanometer cathode powders of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8M0.2O3-δ(M= Fe、Mn、Cu、Zn,) 
oxides were prepared by citrate-EDTA complexing method. X-ray diffraction results of all 
samples calcined at 800℃ revealed that the single phase LaCoO3 (Cubic, JCPDS 75-0279) 
structure of perovskite was formed. As the calcined temperature above 950℃, the phase transited 
to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (Hexagonal, JCPDS 36-1393). LSCCu and LSCZ cathode powder have second 
phase of LaSrCoO4 (Tetragonal, JCPDS 83-2412) and the amount of second phase increased with 
calcine temperature increased. Second phase CuO (JCPDS 44-0706) was formed in LSCCu as 
calcined temperature increased to 1200℃. ZnO second phase was formed with LSCZ between 
800~1200℃. From the result of SEM micrographs, it was found that the grain size of LSCF, 
LSCM and LSCZ is lower than 1μm, however, the grain size LSCCu is between 6~10μm. LSCF 
exhabited the best conductivity of 2182 S/cm at 300℃. The conductivity value of LSCM and 
LSCCu are 1022 S/cm at 300℃and 473 S/cm at 400~450℃, respectively . The conductivity of 
LSCZ is only 256 S/cm at 700℃. Arrhenius analysis show that LSCF、LSCM and LSCCu have 
two step slope which mean that two kinds of conductivity mechanism were exited. The 
electrochemical performance of the cathode on the electrolyte was studied by electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS). AC impedance data show low the charge-transfer resistance (R2) 
and diffusion resistance (R3) of LSCF and LSCCu.

3、 實驗步驟 
3.1 陰極粉末之製備 
本子計畫是以 Citrate-EDTA 合成法
(Citrate-EDTA complexing method)合成所需
之 陰 極 粉 末 ， EDTA (ethylenediamine 
tetraacetic acid，乙二胺四乙酸)為一個六齒
配位體的金屬螯合物，其結構中4個酸和2
個胺的位置皆可作為配位體的齒(配位數
=6)，可同時螯合多種金屬離子，對於合成
陰極材料來說，EDTA對其陽離子具有更強
的螯合作用，可更有效的製備多重金屬氧化
物粉末。 
首 先 將 EDTA 溶 解 於 氨 水 ， 再 將
La(NO3)3加入EDTA氨水溶液中持續加熱攪
拌直到La(NO3)3完全溶解，再將Sr(NO3)2、
Co(NO3)2‧6H2O及欲摻雜的其他金屬硝酸
物溶於另一杯氨水溶液當中，將兩杯溶液混
合後加入檸檬酸。EDTA：檸檬酸：總金屬
離子莫耳數的比為1：1.5：1，等到全部溶
解後再以氨水控制將pH值至6。配置好溶液
後，將溶液持續加熱攪拌直至溶液變成濃稠
的凝膠狀，以250℃加熱3小時即可得到泡綿
狀的粉末，最後再進行800 ~ 1200℃煆燒即
可得到所需之陰極粉末。流程圖如Fig. 2所

4、 結果與討論 
4.1 XRD晶相分析 
4.1.1 La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ 之粉末 
本實驗是使用四點式的導電性量測方
式，所量測到的導電率包含了陰極材料的電
子導性及離子導性，從文獻中可以發現，在
低溫時離子在晶格中較不容易移動且電子
的平均自由路徑較短，故在低溫的環境下離
子導性可忽略，導電率可視為電子導性所主
導；而在高溫時晶格中的氧變的活耀，使得
晶格中的氧損失造成氧缺陷的生成，而晶格
中氧缺陷的形成使得離子躍遷變的容易，造
成材料的離子導性上升，故在高溫環境下可
視為離子導性所主導[3]。 
Fig. 9 為陰極粉末高壓成形之樣品再經
高溫燒結後之導電性量測圖，由圖可發現在
四種不同成分當中，LSCF 為導電性最好之
陰極材料，其導電性在 300℃有最高值 2182 
S/cm，其次為 LSCM 陰極材料，其導電性
在 300℃有最高值 1022 S/cm，LSCCu 陰極
材料在 400~450℃有最高值 473 S/cm，而導
電性最差的陰極材料為 LSCZ，其導電性在
700℃有最高值 256 S/cm。LSCCu 及 LSCZ
之導電性較LSCF及LSCM差的原因可能為
材料本身導電性質差異外，亦有可能為陰極
材料當中第二相的生成所導致，其中 LSCZ
第二相 ZnO 的生成量較多使得其導電性相
較於 LSCCu 更低。 
利用 Arrhenius 方程式，將 ln σT 對 
1000/T 作圖，即可利用其線性斜率將活化
能 (Ea) 求出，Fig. 10 即為不同 pH 值所製
備樣品之 lnσT vs 1000/T 所得之結果，
Table 2 為所計算出低溫(Ea1)與高溫(Ea2)
之活化能，可發現 LSCZ 只有一階段曲線變
化，代表 LSCZ 陰極材料再升溫的過程中，
並沒有導電機制的轉變；LSCF、LSCM 及
LSCCu 皆有兩階段的曲線變化，表示二者
皆有導電機制的變化，且經計算之活化能並
無太大差異，亦表示具有相似的導電機制。 
4.4 陰極粉末之交流阻抗分析

La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8M0.2O3-δ (M= Fe、Mn、Cu、

值隨著溫度上升而下降，LSCCu 陰極材料
有最低的活化阻抗，其次是 LSCF，而 LSCM
有最高的活化阻抗。並可發現在較低溫(550
℃ )時 LSCZ(32.83 Ωcm2)及 LSCM(31.73 
Ωcm2)之活化組抗其值較 LSCCu(3.81 Ωcm2)
及 LSCF(5.09 Ωcm2)高，但隨著溫度的上
升，LSCZ 及 LSCM 之活化組抗明顯下降，
當溫度大於 700℃，其四者之活化阻抗之差
異則不明顯。由 Fig. 12(b)亦可發現擴散阻
抗與溫度的直接關係，隨著溫度的上升，其
擴散阻抗持續下降，且擴散阻抗值的關係與
活化阻抗相同，LSCCu 陰極材料具有最低
的擴散阻抗，其次是 LSCF，而 LSCM 有最
高的擴散阻抗。在溫度大於 750℃時，其四
者之擴散阻抗之差異則不明顯。 
將活化阻抗與擴散阻抗分對應可發現，
擴散阻抗值皆大於活化阻抗，可說明在整體
陰極極化阻抗主要是由擴散阻抗所主導，而

Abstract 
In this study, the potential candidates Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (designed as BSCF) oxides, 
for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) were successfully 
prepared with a combined citrate-EDTA complexing method. The BSCF precursor 
solutions were prepared from Ba(NO3)2, Sr(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 
citric acid and EDTA-NH3 with pH values of 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The precursors were 
dried and subsequently calcined at 950℃ for 12 h and sintered at 1050℃ for 5 h. The 
crystal, chemical composition, and conductivity were studied by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), energy dispersive 
spectrum (EDS) and four-point DC measurement. The X-ray diffraction results of all 
samples prepared from different pH solution revealed that the basic structure of 
perovskite was formed. Although samples prepared from different pH solutions have 
similar structure, however, chemical composition and grain morphologies are different. 
The optimized composition was found to be a BSCF electrode prepared from the 
precursor solution with a pH value of 6; this showed the highest conductivity at 50.2 
S/cm at 400℃, which is 1.3 times higher than the sample prepared from the precursor 
solution with a pH value of 9.

with a very high oxygen permeation flux due to the high concentration of oxygen 
vacancies [3]. In 2001, Huang et al. applied SCF as the cathode materials for SOFC 
however, the phase is not stable at lower oxygen partial pressure [4]. In 2000, Shao et al. 
widely investigated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) as an oxygen separation membrane 
[5]; it was found that the BSCF exhibits high oxygen permeation and acceptable 
conductivity. Recently, BSCF was applied as a new cathode material for IT-SOFC [6]. 
It exhibited a high power density of 1010 mW/cm2 at 600℃ when using hydrogen as 
the fuel and air as the cathode gas.  
It is widely agreed that the oxygen electro-reduction process in the cathode electrode 
is a multistep electrochemical process, including: (1) diffusion of O2 from the gas phase 
to the surface of cathode; (2) dissociation of the chemisorbed oxygen molecule into 
atomic oxygen at the active site; (3) charge transfer; (4) diffusion of O2- from the 
cathode electrode to the cathode/electrolyte interface and into the electrolyte [7]. The 
excellent electrochemical performance of BSCF can be attributed to its high oxygen 
vacancy and high rate of oxygen diffusion. In fact, the oxygen diffusion flux is affected 
both in the chemical composition and the microstructure. It was reported that oxygen 
diffusion flux increases with a decrease in average grain size of BSCF materials [8]. 
However, it has been mentioned that the desired stoichiometric composition is the major 
factor for determining the oxygen diffusion flux rate of BSCF prepared from different

2. Experimental  
In this study, BSCF powders were prepared using the citrate-EDTA complexing 
method. First, 0.04 mol of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Riedel-dehaen, 98%) 
was mixed with 50 ml 13 N NH4OH solution to make NH3-EDTA solution. Then, 0.01 
mol of Ba(NO3)2 (J. T. Baker, 99.6%) was added to the NH3-EDTA solution, which was 
heated and stirred. Next, 0.01 mol of Sr(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.0%), 0.016 mol of 
Co(NO3)2．6H2O (J. T. Baker, 99.8%) and 0.004 mol of Fe(NO3)3．9H2O (Alfa Aesar, 
98.0~101.0%) were dissolved in the other NH3-EDTA solution. These two solutions 
were mixed and stirred, then 0.06 mol of citric acid was added. The mole ratios of 
EDTA: citric acid: total metal ions were 1:1.5:1. The pH value was adjusted to 5, 6, 8, 9, 
and 10 by adding different amounts of NH4OH solution (designed as BSCF5, BSCF6, 
BSCF8, BSCF9, and BSCF10). Each solution was heated on a hotplate at 100℃ and 
stirred until the water evaporated and a sticky gel was formed. The gelled BSCF 
precursors were heated at 200℃ for 3 h. After heat treatment, the samples were 
calcined at 950℃ for 12 h. Finally, the samples were sintered at 1050℃ for 5 h.  
The phase identification of the BSCF powders was performed with a powder 
diffractometer (LabX, XRD-6000) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation, and the diffraction 
angle from 20
o
 to 80
 o
 with a step of 0.01
o
 and a rate of 1
o
/min. The chemical 
composition of all samples was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass 
 8
3. Results and discussion 
To confirm the formation of the BSCF oxide, the samples were analyzed using XRD. 
The XRD patterns of the BSCF powders are presented in Fig. 1. The five kinds of the 
BSCF powders, which were prepared from precursor solutions with different pH levels, 
were well indexed single-phase as a cubic ABO3 perovskite-type structure with a lattice 
parameter range of 3.9849 to 3.9873 A. This result show that the samples prepared from 
the precursor solutions with different pH values exhibited the same structure and 
phases.  
Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of the BSCF electrodes prepared from BSCF powders 
synthesized from precursor solutions with different pH values and sintered at 1050℃ 
for 5 h. It was found that the microstructures of all the samples were porous and the 
gain size was in the range of 4.5~9.0 μm. This suggests that the powder characterization 
of all powders prepared from precursor solutions with different pH values are similar 
therefore, the microstructure of the BSCF sintered electrode is similar. 
A high electronic conductivity is important because it may result in a good 
current-collecting efficiency and a low ohmic resistance for a cathode electrode of 
IT-SOFC. It is well known that there are electronic and ionic conductivity mechanisms 
in a mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC), due to the co-presence of holes and 
oxygen vacancies. However, the ionic conductivity is much lower than the electric 
o

The sample prepared from the precursor solution with a pH of 6 exhibited the highest 
conductivity of 50.2 S/cm, which is about 33% higher than that of the sample prepared 
from the precursor solution with a pH of 9 (37.7 S/cm). The electrical conductivity of 
all samples decreases as the temperature increases above 400℃. An increase in ionic 
conductivity with the increase in operating temperature should be expected due to the 
higher concentration oxygen vacancies and diffusion rate at temperature higher than 
400℃. It is believed that the decrease of electronic conductivity at temperatures above 
400℃ cause by the hopping of small polarsons. The concentration of various valence 
states of Co and Fe ions changed by the release of oxygen from the BSCF lattice, 
therefore, affect the electronic conductivity. The temperature at which the samples 
exhibit maximum conductivity in this study is much lowers than the reported of 
conductivity of about 33 S/cm at 570℃ by Wei et al [10], but similar to that reported by 
Shao et al. [15]. It is believed that the difference is due to the chemical composition’s 
slightly variation. Although the conductivity of all samples is lower than that of cathode 
materials, such as La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (LSCF) [16], the loss of lattice oxygen upon 
heating can lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies for BSCF. Therefore, a higher 
oxygen ionic conductivity is expected than for LSCF, occurs not only on the 
triple-phase boundary but also the surface of the electrode; this is an important reason 
for BSCF to exhibit better electrochemical performance [17].  
 12
the precursor solution with a pH value of 6, had the best stoichiometric ratio and more 
homogeneous element distribution compared to the other samples. This is the major 
reason for it to exhibit better conductivity and electrochemical performance than other 
samples. These results suggest that the chelating between the EDTA or citric acid and 
metal cations was affected by the pH value of the precursor solution. Therefore, the 
composition of BSCF samples is different after heat treatment and affects the 
performance of BSCF electrodes.

1. Introduction 
A Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is regarded as a highly efficient and clean power-generation 
system because of its high conversion efficiency and low pollution [1]. A conventional 
high-temperature SOFC (HT-SOFC) is based on the 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) 
electrolyte, which requires operation at a high temperature range of 800~1000℃. However, such a 
high operation temperature causes many problems such as high cost, limitation of the materials for 
sealing and the current connector, reactions between the components, thermal expansion mismatch, 
and a long start-up and shut-off period, etc. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in 
SOFCs operating at an intermediate temperature range of 600~800℃. A key issue in the 
development of intermediate temperature SOFCs (IT-SOFCs) is the use of a highly ion conductive 
electrolyte at intermediate temperatures. Recently, high temperature protonic conductors (HTPCs) 
have gained considerable attention because they are used as solid electrolytes for electrochemical 
devices such as IT-SOFCs, hydrogen sensors, hydrogen pumps, steam electrolyzers, etc. 
There are many kinds of perovskite-type oxides that have oxygen vacancies and p-type 
conductivity. Perovskite-type oxides such as BaZrO3, SrZrO3, SrCeO3 and BaCeO3 doped with a 
rare-earth oxide are known to be proton conductors. It was found that protonic conductivity appears 
as electronic conductivity decreases for these ceramics in water vapor or a hydrogen atmosphere. 
Cation-doped BaCeO3 attracted great interest in the 1980s and 1990s due to their high proton 
conductivity at 400~700℃. Iwahara and co-workers demonstrated that BaCeO3 has the highest 
protonic conductivity among these HTPCs [2-4]. BaCeO3-based HTPCs have been considered good 
 5
The water incorporation results in the uptake of two protons per oxygen vacancy in the structure. 
The concentration of protons in the material depends on the oxygen vacancy concentration and, 
therefore, also on the dopant content. The protons are quasi-free and generally not bound to any 
particular oxygen ions; they can migrate from one oxygen ion to another in the nearest neighbor 
oxygen ion in the lattice. This migration mechanism results in high proton conductivity (as high as 
10-2 Ω-1cm-1 at 500℃) for these HTPC oxides [16]. The doped BaCeO3 exhibited both ion and 
p-type electrical conductivity at higher temperatures in a high Po2 and dry atmosphere, whereas it 
was a pure ion conductor at lower temperatures in a low Po2 and moist atmosphere. The 
conductivity mechanism in doped perovskites was discussed was detail by Ma. et al. [17] and Haile 
et al. [13]. These results show that protons are actually associated with oxide ions from hydroxide 
ions. 
It is essential to ensure that the materials have thermodynamic or at least long-term kinetic 
stability in addition to good conductivity in the application environment for the electrolyte of SOFC. 
As many researchers have pointed out, a concern for BaCeO3 is chemical stability. Stability 
problems in atmospheres containing water and CO2 are generally suspected because of the 
thermodynamic instability of BaCeO3 towards these gases. For pure BaCeO3, the standard Gibbs 
free energy change of the reaction of BaCeO3 with water is zero at 403℃ and is negative at lower 
temperatures. BaCeO3 also tends to react with carbon dioxide to form barium carbonate and cerium 
oxide; the standard Gibbs free energy is zero at 1041℃ and negative at lower temperature [18]. 
Therefore, BaCeO3 is thermodynamically unstable in high partial pressure of water and carbon 
 7
2. Experimental  
The yttria and strontium doped barium cerates were prepared by conventional solid-state 
synthesis techniques. Stoichiometric ratios of high purity oxide powders of BaCO3 (J. T. Baker, 
99.9%), CeO2 (Alfa, 99.9%), SrO (Alfa, 99.99%) and Y2O3 (Alfa, 99.99%) were mixed and ball 
milled in ethanol for 24 h. The dried powders were subsequently calcined at 1300℃ in air for 12 h. 
The calcined powders were pressed under 20 kg/cm2 into approximately 1 cm diameter and 2 mm 
thick pellets. The samples were subsequently isostatically pressed at 25MPa and finally sintered at 
1600℃ for 4 h in air to obtain specimens with relative densities higher than 95%.  
The phase identification of the BSCF powders was performed with a powder diffractometer 
(LabX, XRD-6000) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation and the diffraction angle from 20
o
 to 80
 o
 with 
a step of 0.01
o
 and a rate of 1
o
 /min, and on the beam line 01C2 at the National Synchrotron 
Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan, operating at an energy of 9.3 keV (λ＝0.495942 
Å). The conductivity measurement and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were made under 
wet air and 100 % carbon dioxide in a temperature range of 450-750℃ by a dc two-probe method 
and the complex impedance was determined using an impedance analyzer (HIOKI, 3532-50) with 
condition of 100 mV, 1000 kHz to 0.01 Hz frequency.

that the BaCe1-xYxO3-δ is an ionic conductor. It was found that the conductivities of BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-δ, 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ, and BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ are much higher than that of BaCe0.6Y0.4O3-δ. The resulting 
conductivity of the BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ at 550~700℃ is higher than that of BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-δ and 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ. The BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ exhibited the maximum conductivity of 0.026 S/cm at 750℃ 
which is much higher than that of the Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) and 16mol% yttria-doped zirconia 
(8YSZ). It is well known that when BaCeO3 is doped with yttrium, it is expected that Y3+ ions will 
replace the Ce4+, creating doubly charged oxygen vacancies. In HTPC, the proton conductivity 
resulted from oxygen ion vacancies and the dissociative absorption of water. Therefore, the 
concentration of protonic defects (OH.O) in these materials depends on the oxygen ion vacancy 
concentration, humidity and atmosphere. 
The activation energy of the conductivity of BaCe1-xYxO3-δ, Ea, was determined by plotting 
ln(σ‧T) vs 1000/T following the Arrhenius equation of σ‧T=A·exp(−Ea/RT). Fig. 3 is an 
Arrhenius plot of the conductivity of BaCe1-xYxO3-δ at 400~750℃. It is worth noting that the 
conductivity behavior of all samples shows an apparently change above 650℃. An Ea value of 
73~101 kJ/mol is calculated in the low temperature range of 400~650℃. However, an Ea value of 
34~52 kJ/mol is obtained in the high temperature range of 650~750℃. This result indicated that the 
conductivity mechanism changes as the measured temperature of 650℃. Dynys reported similar 
results, but the temperature for the conductivity mechanism change in this study was higher than 
that reported by Dynys [20]. The probable reasons for conductivity mechanism change are the 
phase transformations of BaCe1-xYxO3-δ and the charge carrier change from proton to oxygen-ion in 
 11
oxygen conductivity at about 600℃; this is similar to the result in air. However, the activation 
energy of samples in a CO2 rich atmosphere is a little higher than that in air. It is suggested that the 
chemical reaction between BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ and CO2 is lower for other samples. Fig. 7 shows the 
XRD patterns of all samples’ heat treatment in 100% CO2 atmosphere at 750℃ (λ=0.495942 Å). It 
was found that only a small amount of BaCO3 impure phases was formed in the BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-δ, 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ, BaCe0.75Y0.25O3-δ and BaCe0.7Y0.3O3-δ samples. However, a large amount of BaCO3 
and CeO2 impure phases was formed in the BaCe0.6Y0.4O3-δ sample; this is the main reason that the 
BaCe0.6Y0.4O3-δ sample does not exhibit conductivity behavior in a CO2 atmosphere.  
From the result described above, it was found that the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ sample has the highest 
conductivity in both air and CO2 atmosphere, and the structure is more stable in CO2 for the other 
samples. Therefore, the structure of the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ sample in water was further investigated. It 
is impossible to restrain the chemical reaction between BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ with water due to the 
negative Gibb’s free energy of this reaction below 403℃. However, it is possible to decrease the 
reaction rate. The XRD patterns of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ exposed to a water vapor-rich environment at 80 
℃ at different durations are shown in Fig. 8. It was found that the structure of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ is 
stable below 2 h. There is only a small amount of Ba(OH)2 phases formed at 4 h, as the time 
increases to 6 h, the  Ba(OH)2 and CeO2 phases are clearly observed. The perovskite main 
structure of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ almost disappeared completely and reacted into the Ba(OH)2 and CeO2 
phase with water.  
In order to improve the structural stability of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ in water, Sr-doped BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ 
 13
Conclusions 
The BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ exhibits the highest conductivity of 0.026 S/cm and 0.025 S/cm at 750℃ in air 
and CO2, respectively. However, the reaction rate of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ with water is extremetly high, 
and the perovskite structure decomposes into Ba(OH)2 and CeO2 phases after 8 h in water. Sr-doped 
BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ has slightly lower conductivity, but the structural stability is much better than that 
of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ. Ba0.9Sr0.1Ce0.8Y0.2O3-δ exhibits high conductivity of 0.023 S/cm at 750℃ and the 
perovskite structure is still remains after 8 h in water.

1. Introduction 
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are devices that convert chemical energy into heat and 
electricity directly without involving combustion cycles. Compared with traditional 
energy technology, SOFCs have many advantages, such as high-energy conversion 
efficiency, high power density, low pollution and flexibility in using hydrocarbon fuels 
[1]. Conventional SOFCs operate at high temperature of around 800~1000℃. However, 
this has many disadvantages, including that there are chemical reactions between 
components, only expansive ceramic conductor can be used as interconnectors, a long 
warm-up duration etc. If the operation temperature of SOFCs can be decreased to 
600~800℃, the inexpensive stainless steel could be used as the interconnector, thus the 
chemical and thermal durability of all the components would be enhanced. However, 
the conductivity of the cathode material will decrease and the activation polarization of 
cathode electrode will obviously increase at low temperatures. Therefore, the 
development of high performance cathode materials is quite an important issue for 
intermediate-temperature SOFCs (IT-SOFC).  
Perovskite-type oxides such as La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) [2] and La1-xSrxCoO3 (LSC) [3] 
and related materials have been widely studied and used as cathode materials for SOFC. 
The high catalytic activity of LSC is much higher than that of LSM due to its high ionic 
conductivity and high oxygen vacancy concentration which enables the migration of 
 5
2. Experimental 
Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xCuxO3-δ (x=0~0.4) (SSCCu) powders were prepared by the 
glycine-nitrate process (GNP) [8]. The GNP precursor solution was prepared from the 
stoichiometric amount of Sm(NO3)‧6H2O, Sr(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2‧6H2O, 
Cu(NO3)2‧1.5H2O. These metal ions sources were dissolved in distilled water. The Cu 
content was 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mol% (designed as SSC, SSCCu01, SSCCu02, 
SSCCu03 and SSCCu04, respectively). The mole ratio of glycine to NO3- was 0.5. Each 
solution was heated on a hotplate at 100℃ and stirred until water was evaporated and a 
sticky gel appeared; this resulted in rapid and self-sustaining combustion. The resultant 
ash was then calcined at 1000℃ for 4 h in air to form the SSCC phase of the perovskite 
structure.  
The thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA, Setaram, Setsys 
Evolution) was performed from room temperature to 1000℃ in air at a rate of 5 ℃/min. 
The phase identification of the BSCF powders was performed with a powder 
diffractometer (LabX, XRD-6000) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation, and a diffraction 
angle from 20
o
 to 80
o
 with a step of 0.01
o
 and a rate of 1
o
 /min. The conductivity of the 
electrode was measured with the DC 4 terminal method in air using Aglient 34970A 
and Aglient 6645A, from 450 to 800℃. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS) was measured by potentiostant (Solartron 1287) and a frequency analyzer 
(Solartron 1255B/1255) from 0.1~1MHz with a condition of 10mV. The morphologies

3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 1 shows the DTA/TG thermal analysis of the SSCCu02 precursor. It was found 
that there is a violently exothermic reaction at 170℃, which is accompanied by 85% 
weight loss. This is due to the rapid and self-sustaining combustion of the precursor. 
The XRD patterns of SSC sample calcined at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 
2. It was found that the orthorhombic perovskite start formed as the calcination 
temperature increased to 800℃. As the calcination temperature increased to 1000℃, a 
single orthorhombic perovskite formed with good crystallization. Fig. 3 shows the XRD 
patterns of SSCCu01, SSCCu02, SSCCu03 and SSCCu04 samples calcined at 1000℃ 
for 4 h. The structure of the Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.9Cu0.1O3-δ, Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ and 
Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Cu0.3O3-δ samples was single orthorhombic perovskite phase (JCPDS 
53-0112). Second phase SrCoO2.8 (JCPDS 39-1084), however, formed in the 
Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.6Cu0.4O3-δ samples. It was found that the crystallization of samples 
increased as copper content increased due to the decrease in the melting point of the 
sample with the increase in the doping amount of Cu. 
High electronic conductivity is important because it may result in a good 
current-collecting efficiency and a low ohmic resistance for a cathode electrode of 
IT-SOFC. It is well known that there are electronic and ionic conductivity mechanism 
in a mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC), due to the co-presence of holes and 
oxygen vacancies. However, the ionic conductivity is much lower than the electric

For SSCCu02 sample, the overpotential only slightly increases from 0 mV to 25 mV as 
the current density increase to 200 mA/cm2 and reaches a stable value. The 
overpotential does not increase with current density increase up to 400 mA/cm2. The 
overpotential behavior of the SSCCu03 sample is similar to that of SSCCu02, but the 
maximum overpotential is 65 mV at 400 mA/cm2. It was found that the overpotential of 
SSCCu02 is much lower than that of the SSC, SSCCu01 and SSCCu03 samples. A 
Comparison of the overpotential of all samples measured at 700℃ and 800℃ is shown 
in Fig. 7. It was found that the overpotential increase behavior is similar, but the 
maximum overpotential data of samples measured at 800℃ is lower than that measured 
at 700℃ by about 10~50 mV. It is well agreed that the oxygen electro-reduction process 
in a cathode electrode is a multistep electrochemical process, including: (1) diffusion of 
O2 from the gas phase to the surface of the cathode; (2) dissociation of chemisorbed 
oxygen molecules into atomic oxygen at the active site; (3) charge transfer; and (4) 
diffusion of O2- from the cathode electrode to cathode/electrolyte interface and into the 
electrolyte [11]. It is suggested that the low overpotential behavior of SSCCu02 is due 
to the high oxygen vacancy concentration [12]. The activation polarization of the 
cathode electrode at low temperatures is mainly due to the dissociation rate of 
chemisorbed oxygen molecules and oxygen diffusion [13, 14]. In order to retain the

electrodes on the SDC electrolyte recorded at 700℃ in air are shown in Fig. 9. It can be 
seen that the ASR of SSCCu is obviously lower than that of the SSC electrode. The 
ASR of SSC, SSCCu01, SSCCu02 and SSCCu03 electrode is 11.3, 7.3, 0.2 and 0.5 Ω．
cm2, respectively. The logarithm of electrical conductivity versus the reciprocal 
temperature of SSC and SSCCu electrodes is shown in Fig. 10. The activation energy 
(Ea) is calculated from the slopes of the linear part of ln σT versus 1000/T plots. The 
activation energy is 109, 75, 129 and 118 KJ/mole, respectively. These values are much 
lower than that of LSCF cathode electrode [15]. The potential resistance of the cathode 
electrode is closely related not only to the charge transfer and the 
adsorption/dissociation of oxygen, but also to the transport speed of oxide ions through 
the bulk and across the cathode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the kinetics of oxygen 
exchange and diffusion of oxide ions in the cathode materials as well as electronic 
conductivity play a critical role in the oxygen reduction reaction [16]. It is suggested 
that the kinetic of oxygen exchange and diffusion of oxygen in the SSCCu02 sample is 
higher than that in the other samples; therefore it exhibits the lowest overpotential and 
ASR, even though its conductivity is not the highest. For the SSCCu03 sample, a small 
amount of second phase start formed, so the electrochemical performance cannot be 
further improved. The quantification of oxygen vacancy concentration in SSCCu 
samples and power density of a single cell based on the SSCCu02 cathode electrode are

4. Conclusion 
Sm0.5Sr0.5Co1-xCuxO3-δ(x=0~0.3) cathode materials were successfully prepared by GNP 
and had a stable orthorhombic perovskite structure. The Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ 
exhibited an acceptable conductivity of 125 S/cm at 700℃, the lowest overpotential of 
25mV at 400mA/cm2 and the lowest area special resistance of 0.2 Ω．cm2 at 700℃. 
Therefore, Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ will be a promising candidate for intermediate 
temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode material.
