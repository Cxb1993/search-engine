El-Tawil (2009b) presented a new predictor-corrector technique, termed the Full Operator Method (FOM), in which the 
assumptions about the tested structure’s response are shifted to the predictor step, which results in an enhancement in overall 
simulation accuracy, especially for nonlinear structures. Unlike OSM, which splits the displacement and velocity operators into 
explicit and implicit terms, the new method uses predicted acceleration to compute fully-explicit displacement and velocity 
values in the predictor step.  
This study extends the investigation of the FOM by exploring its numerical characteristics, including the stability and accuracy 
properties. In addition, the effectiveness of using the FOM to predict the dynamic behavior of systems with three different types 
of nonlinearity, i.e., hardening, stiffening, and softening behavior, is explored. Then, the hybrid simulation technique is applied 
with the FOM to predict the seismic response of a numerical 12-story composite coupled wall system. In particular, the effects 
of significant system nonlinearity and displacement control errors induced by hydraulic actuators on the performance of FOM 
are considered.  
 
FULL OPERATOR METHOD (FOM) 
FOM, which is developed based on the OSM, is a type of predictor-corrector algorithm intended for hybrid simulation. One 
advantage of FOM over OSM is that FOM uses estimated tangent stiffness to replace the initial stiffness term in the OSM so as 
to increase the accuracy of hybrid testing. Full details of the FOM are found in (Hung and El-Tawil 2009b), but in the interest 
of completeness, a summary is provided herein.  
In the predictor step of the FOM, the equation of motion can be expressed as 
 
11111 ˆˆˆˆ +++++ =++ nnnnn frvCaM  , (1) 
 
where M  is the mass matrix of the structure; Cˆ  is the predictor damping coefficient matrix, which is constant if it is mass-
proportional or can be computed from the stiffness matrix of the structure if stiffness proportional damping is assumed; rˆ  is 
the predictor restoring force vector; f  is the vector of external excitation forces; aˆ  is the predictor acceleration vector; vˆ  is 
the predictor velocity vector; subscript n is the time step.  
In contrast to the OSM that only uses the explicit terms of Newmark’s integration scheme to compute the predictor response, 
the FOM uses the full response expression to increase the predictor accuracy as follows:

∆=∆=Ω ω  is the sampling frequency; and α is defined as the estimation error of the tangent stiffness and is

The stability of the FOM can be investigated using the spectral radius of amplification matrix A (Belytschko and Hughes 2001). 
The spectral radius )(Aρ  is the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the amplification matrix. An algorithm is stable when its 
spectral radius is less than or equal to 1.  
The influence of β on the stability of the FOM is investigated by determining the spectral radius of the FOM’s amplification 
matrix versus sampling frequency
 
Ω  (or equivalently, Tt /∆ ) with varying β . γ  is selected as 
2
1
 herein and for the rest of 
this study. It is found that the FOM is a conditionally stable algorithm. Three β s, i.e., ,
4
1,
2
1
 and 
6
1
, are selected as example 
values and their corresponding spectral radii are plotted in Figure 1. It can be seen that the stability condition for the FOM 
varies with different β . For example, the critical stability condition ( )criTt /∆  is 0.41 when 6
1
=β (linear acceleration 
method), whereas it decreases to 0.32 when 
4
1
=β (average acceleration method). For the cases considered in Figure 1, 
2
1
=β  results in the most stringent stability condition with ( ) 23.0/ =∆ criTt . The effect of the accuracy of the estimated 
tangent stiffness on the stability condition of the FOM is explored. The relationship between the spectral radius and Tt /∆  is 
investigated for varying α  and β . It is found that the influence of the variation of β  on the spectral radius is similar, 
therefore only the results from 
4
1
=β  are plotted in Figure 2. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the stability condition becomes 
more stringent as the accuracy of the estimated tangent stiffness decreases. In particular, ( )criTt /∆ decreases more rapidly 
when the estimated tangent stiffness is overestimated (i.e., 1>α ) than when the estimated tangent stiffness is underestimated 
( 1<α ).  
The most commonly used measures of numerical accuracy are the numerical damping ratio and period distortion (Belytschko 
and Hughes 2001; Hung and El-Tawil 2009a). Among the four eigenvalues of the amplification matrix A , two are complex 
numbers, one is a real number, and one equals zero. The displacement history response can be obtained using eigenvalues as 
follows (Belytschko and Hughes 2001):  
 
[ ] nddnn ctnctnctnd 3321 )sin()cos()exp( λωωωξ +∆+∆∆′−=  , (8) 
  Page 6 
the FOM is compared with the results obtained from the OSM as well as the conventional numerical method, the central 
difference method (CDM). The CDM solution is used as the reference solution for comparison. In order to ensure that the CDM 
can produce a reliable solution, a small incremental time step of 0.00001 s is used. On the other hand, the incremental time step, 
t∆  for the FOM and OSM is 0.01 s, and the resulting Tt /∆  for the systems considered is within the stability condition as 
examined in the previous section. The β  value for the FOM is 4
1
. In order to observe the difference between the solutions 
obtained from the various schemes more closely, the spring-mass system is assumed to be repeatedly subject to the ground 
motion history of the 1940 El Centro earthquake with a total duration of 60 s.  
The simulated behavior of the system with hardening stiffness is plotted in Figure 6. It can be seen from Figure 6(a) that the 
FOM and OSM results coincide with the reference solution when the initial system frequency is 3.3 rad/s. However, as the 
frequency is increased to 10 rad/s, the solution obtained with the OSM deviates significantly from the reference solution. The 
FOM however is still able to produce a satisfactory solution, as shown in Figure 6(b). The simulated dynamic behavior of the 
system with stiffening stiffness is shown in Figure 7. When the frequency is 3.3 rad/s, the FOM produces a solution that 
matches the reference solution closely, whereas the OSM simulation result deviates slightly from the reference solution in terms 
of magnitude and period. When the frequency is increased to 10 rad/s, the accuracy of the FOM and OSM solutions decreases 
and the solutions gradually deviate from the reference solution as the simulation proceeds. Nevertheless, the FOM generated 
solution still captures the reference response more closely than the OSM. Figure 8 shows the simulated dynamic responses of 
the system with softening behavior that can be used to represent when the collapse behavior takes place. Figure 8(a) indicates 
that when the frequency is 3.3 rad/s, both the FOM and OSM can predict the collapse behavior of the system. However, when 
the frequency is increased to 10 rad/s, the OSM fails to capture the collapse behavior, while the FOM is still able to simulate the 
collapse behavior of the system under the prescribed earthquake with satisfactory accuracy. 
The above examples demonstrate that the FOM is capable of generating reasonably accurate solutions for structures with 
various types of nonlinearity. It is also shown that the FOM simulation results are more accurate than the OSM solutions. 
However, like other numerical schemes for hybrid simulation, the increasing Tt /∆  lessens the simulation accuracy. 
 
HYBRID SIMULAITON OF A 12-STORY COMPOSITE COUPLED WALL SYSTEM 
In order to evaluate the performance of the FOM for hybrid simulation, the seismic response of a 12-story coupled wall system 
with steel coupling beams is numerically simulated. The plan view of the coupled wall is shown in Figure 9. Due to its 
symmetrical nature, only half of the system is modeled. The length of each wall and the coupling beam is 6.4 m and 1.5 m, 
respectively. The total height of the structure is 44.1 m with the first floor being 4.5 m high and typical floors 3.6 m high. 
Reinforcement details of the shear wall are shown in Table 1. Design details of the coupling beams are shown in Table 2. 
To implement the hybrid simulation scheme, the entire structure is divided into two substructures each of which is numerically 
simulated using OpenSees (2006). As shown in Figure 10, the bottom two floors are chosen to serve as the 1st substructure, 
while the rest of the structure serves as the 2nd substructure. UI-SimCor (Kwon et al. 2008) is used as the hybrid simulation 
platform to implement the FOM and connect the two substructures. The inelastic behavior of the members is modeled. The 
displacement-based beam column element in OpenSees is chosen to simulate the shear walls and coupling beams. Although the 
beam column element is not able to simulate shear deformation and shear failure, it allows distributed plasticity with linear 
curvature distribution along the element. The shear wall in each substructure is modeled with fiber sections so as to account for 
behavior under combined axial force and bending moment. The wall elements are located at the gross section centroid of each 
shear wall. The steel coupling beams are modeled to account for inelastic shear and flexural behavior. The moment of inertia of 
the full cross-section is used for bending and the full web area is used for shear. The coupling beam elements are connected to 
the shear wall elements using rigid elements that represent the physical size of the walls. Concrete02 and Steel01 material 
models in OpenSees are used to simulate concrete and steel properties, respectively. The parameter definitions and the 
properties of the material models are shown in Figure 11 and Table 3. 
The system behavior under the ground motion time history of the 1940 El Centro earthquake is simulated using various 
approaches, including the FOM, the OSM, and the conventional numerical method. The solution from the conventional 
numerical simulation of the entire system from OpenSees is used as the reference solution. In order to investigate the influence 
of significant nonlinearity of the system on the performance of the FOM, the magnitude of the ground motion is scaled so that 
PGA=1.5g. Meanwhile, to account for the displacement control error associated with hydraulic actuators in the physical testing, 
a constant undershoot error with a value of 0.0025 cm is induced in the numerical hybrid testing. In particular, I-Modification 
(Nakashima and Kato 1987), a technique previously proposed for the OSM to suppress the adverse effect of displacement errors, 
is applied with the OSM scheme herein to simulate the system response. The parameter β  in the FOM is 
4
1
. The tangent 
stiffness matrix in the FOM is updated using the Broyden method (Hung and El-Tawil 2009b, Broyden 1965). In addition, in

ABSTRACT 
 
Ductile fiber reinforced concrete (DFRC) possesses a unique strain hardening behavior in tension that translates 
into enhanced shear and bending behavior at the structural level. This paper investigates the seismic 
performance of an 18-story coupled wall system in which DFRC is used to replace the traditional reinforced 
concrete (RC) in coupling beams and the plastic hinge regions in shear walls. The DFRC system is designed 
with less steel and relaxed detailing than the usually required in traditional RC systems in recognition of the 
beneficial effects of DFRC. The system response subjected to strong seismic events with a 2% probability of 
exceedance in 50 years is investigated. System performance is evaluated using various parameters, such as 
deflection curves, inter-story drifts, maximum response, and shear deformation. The performance parameters 
studied suggested that the DFRC system delivers satisfactory seismic performance in spite of the reduced 
reinforcement quantity and relaxed detailing in the DFRC system. The enhanced behavior of DFRC coupled 
wall system is also evidenced by delivering collapse level performance specified in FEMA 356.

INTRODUCTION  
 
High performance fiber reinforced cementitious composites (HPFRCCs) are a class of materials that have 
properties that are attractive to structural engineers. These materials are characterized by pseudo-ductile tensile 
strain hardening behavior after first cracking accompanied by multiple cracks and large energy absorption prior 
to crack localization (Li 2003 and Naaman 2006). HPFRCCs have the potential to serve as highly damage 
tolerant and energy absorbing materials under severe loading conditions, especially seismic loading. This paper 
numerically studies and compares the performance of a traditional RC 18-story coupled wall systems with 
another similar system in which the coupling beams and plastic hinge region are HPFRCC instead of RC. 
 
SYSTEM DESIGN 
 
The theme system considered herein consists of a 94 ft (28.7 m) by 78.5 ft (23.9 m) (in plan) steel moment 
resisting frame surrounding a 47 ft (14.3 m) by 31.5 ft (9.6 m) (in plan) core wall system. The plan view of the 
prototype structure is given in Figure 1. The total height of the structure is 219 ft (66.7 m). The first floor’s 
height is 15 ft (4.6 m) and typical floors are 12 ft (3.7 m) high. The thickness of the wall is 20 in (508 mm) and 
the total structure’s weight is 20,831 kips (9449 tons). Two different prototype wall systems are designed. The 
first is a traditional RC system. The second prototype has HPFRCC coupling beams. In addition, HPFRCC is 
used in the first four floors of the wall piers. 
 
and California University for Research in Earthquake Engineering ‘CUREe’) steel project, have a PGA of 0.42g, 
0.68g, and 0.71g for LA23, LA34, and LA37, respectively. To reduce the computational effort, only the strong 
motion duration of the ground motion record is adopted for seismic excitation. The strong motion duration is 
defined as the time segment in which 90 percent of the seismic energy is delivered (Hassan 2005).  
 
Details of component responses, drawn at the time corresponding to the occurrence of maximum system 
response (as determined by roof drift) during each earthquake, are plotted in Figures 4-6. Figure 4 shows the 
story drift of the two systems under each prescribed motion. The figure indicates that the story drifts of both 
systems are approximately the same along the building height. The drift limits in (ASCE 7 2002) imply that a 
maximum interstory drift of 2% shall not be exceeded at the Lift Safety performance level, while this criterion 
does not need to be observed at Collapse Prevention level. Nevertheless, the maximum interstory drifts of both 
prototype structures are around 2% during the 2/50 events, implying that the two systems can deliver similarly 
good performance.

Wall rotations are plotted in Figure 6. It is clear that plastic hinges forms at the base of both systems when the 
peak displacement is reached. While both systems yield similar wall rotations along the height of the building 
under LA23 and LA34, LA37 results in a maximum wall base rotation of 0.01 for the RC system, which is about 
two times larger than the maximum response of the HPFRCC system. This is taken to imply that the HPFRCC 
system is capable of providing improved flexural behavior compared to conventional RC systems.
