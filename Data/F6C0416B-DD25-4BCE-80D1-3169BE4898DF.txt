accuracy/quality of the identified system parameters 
is a function of both the excitation imposed on the 
system as well as the measurement noise (sensor 
noise). The importance of input selection for system 
identification has been recognized for a long time. 
Mehra et al. [6] considers the design of optimal 
inputs for identifying parameters in linear dynamic 
systems. The criterion used for optimization is the 
sensitivity of the system output to the unknown 
parameters as expressed by the weighted trace of the 
Fisher information matrix. Morelli et al. [7], [8] 
considered the design of optimal inputs for airplane’s 
linear model equations form the point of view of 
Cramér-Rao lower bound and its inverse, the Fisher 
information matrix. Numerical simulations of three 
types of sea trials are performed to obtain the 
sensitivities of motions to hydrodynamic coefficients 
[9]. Jauberthie et al. [10] presented the design of 
optimal inputs for aircraft nonlinear controlled 
dynamic models. Graver et al. [11] described the 
development of feedback control for autonomous 
underwater gliders, and derived a nonlinear dynamic 
model of a nominal glider complete with 
hydrodynamic forces and coupling between the 
vehicle and the movable internal mass. Also, Graver 
et al. [12] identified the model parameters to match 
the steady glides in new flight test data from the 
SLOCUM glider.Graver [11] model the underwater 
glider as a rigid body with fixed wings and tail 
immersed in a fluid with buoyancy control and 
controlled internal moving mass. We assign a 
coordinate frame fixed on the vehicle body to have 
its origin at the CB and its axes aligned with the 
principle axes of the ellipsoid. Body axes are 
illustrated in Fig.1. The different masses and position 
vectors are illustrated in Fig. 2. 1 2 3( , , )

In Fig. 5, bfm  and bam  are the mass of ballast 
mass in the fore and aft buoyancy engines, and bfr , 
bar  present their position vector from CB. Thus, the 
variable mass of the glider in Fig. 3.2 becomes 
 
b ba bfm m m= +            (10)  
                        
Here we assume that the variable bfm  and bam  
used to turn the center of gravity aside are equivalent 
to move m  in Fig. 5. In addition, we consider the 
movable mass is constrained in the longitudinal 
direction 1e . The equation between this replacement

    In Eq. (9), K s are unknown parameters. 
However, the lift is nearly linear only at low attack 
angles. Thus the constraint of attack angle was 
specified by 20α < ° . To make dynamic 
programming applicable, the simulation experiment 
is split into stages. In order to avoid a long 
computational time, the test is split into four stages. 
At the initial condition, assume the glider is under 
steady state: the glider speed V = 0.4 m/s, the attack 
angle 1.62α = D , the pitch angle 27.43θ = − D , the 
angular  velocity 2 0Ω = .

Fig.6 Dynamic Programming Diagram 
The simulation variables in this dynamic 
programming procedure are shown in Fig. 6. All 
composition of those different variables must be 
calculated in the optimization process. The variables 
include the maximum input change rate, the 
amplitude of square input signal, the time of stage, 
and the input command choice of absorb or drainage 
in each stages. Optimal input that makes the cost 
function minimized can be calculated. The simulation 
of optimal input is compared with the conventional 
input. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the optimal input and 
conventional input signals for the fore and aft 
buoyancy engines, respectively. This conventional 
input is used to compare with optimal input, and it is 
a regular signal which makes the glider ascends and 
dives, repeatedly. The capacity of each buoyancy 
engines is assumed 1kg. In these figures, the dash 
line represents the command input signal and the 
solid line corresponds to actual input response of the 
buoyancy engines. The rate of change of the ballast 
mass is constrained by the buoyancy engine, and this 
limit is also determined by the dynamic programming 
principle. It can be seen that the input signals change 
very slowly and bounded. They could be applied as 
input signals for real underwater glider system. 
    Following Eqs. (4)-(6), we can establish the 
sensitivity differential equation of ( 2Ω , 1v , 3v )T to 
hydrodynamic coefficients. Then the output 
sensitivities were solved from the sensitivity 
differential equation by Runge-Kutta algorithm of 
order 4. The quality of the identified parameter can

with fore and aft buoyancy engines was modeled. 
Successful implementations of a least-squares 
technique on a Slocum glider confirms the 
applicability of the parameter identification process.
