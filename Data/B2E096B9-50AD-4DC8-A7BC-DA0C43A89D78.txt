Suppose Fv  V(G) and Fe  E(G). If G − Fv − Fe is Hamiltonian (Hamiltonian-connected) 
as long as |Fv| + |Fe| ≤ k, then G is k-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian (k-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian- 
connected) [36]. If G − Fe is Hamiltonian (Hamiltonian-connected) as long as |Fe| ≤ k, then G is 
k-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian (k-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian-connected) [33]. The terms 
k-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceable, k-edge-fault-tolerant strongly Hamiltonian laceable, 
k-edge-fault-tolerant hyper Hamiltonian laceable, and k-edge-fault-tolerant pancyclic can be 
defined similarly (see [33, 36]). 
Given a finite group (, •) and I as the identity of , a set Ω ⊆ is called a generating set of 
 if I  Ω and g−1  Ω for each g  Ω. Then, a Cayley graph G = (V, E) with respect to (, •) 
and Ω is defined as follows: V =  and E = {(x, y) | x, y   and y = x • g for some g  Ω}. 
Cayley graphs were first introduced in [8], where they were used as diagrams to represent groups 
in terms of generators. Cayley graphs are connected and vertex symmetric [2]. They are suitable 
to be the topologies of interconnection networks, because they have many favorable topological 
and fault-tolerant properties [2]. Star graphs [1], alternating group graphs [28], and pancake graphs 
[2]. 
An n-dimensional star graph, denoted by Sn, has the vertex set V(Sn) = {a1a2···an | a1a2···an 
is a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n} and the edge set E(Sn) = {(a1a2···an, aia2···ai−1a1ai+1···an) | a1a2··· 
an  V(Sn) and 2 ≤ i ≤ n}. Sn has n! vertices, each of degree n − 1, and hence the connectivity of 
Sn is n − 1. The edge (a1a2···an, aia2···ai−1a1ai+1···an) is referred to as an i-dimensional edge. We 
use e(i)(v) to denote the i-dimensional edge that is incident to vertex v, and use E(i)(Sn) = {e
(i)(v) | 
v  V(Sn)} to denote the set of all i-dimensional edges in Sn. Sn is both vertex symmetric and 
edge symmetric [2]. 
In general, Sn contains n embedded Sn−1’s. For 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1, an embedded Sr in Sn is 
denoted by s1s2···snr , where s1 =  and there are exactly r − 1 occurrences of  in s2s3···sn. 
When Sn is partitioned into 
d−11n−dn−1, 
d−12n−dn−1, ···, 
d−1nn−dn−1, Sn is said to be 
 7 
where p, q  {1, 2, ···, n} and p  q. We have |Ep,q(AGn)| = (n − 2)!, where n  4. AGn is known 
to be panpositionable Hamiltonian [44] and pancyclic [28]. Besides, AGn can embed grids [28], 
trees [28], and paths of all possible lengths between every two vertices [11]. 
An n-dimensional pancake graph, denoted by n, has the vertex set V(n) = {a1a2···an | a1 
a2···an is a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n} and the edge set E(n) = {(a1a2···an, b1b2···bn) | a1a2···ai = 
bibi−1···b1 and ai+1ai+2···an = bi+1bi+2···bn for some 2 ≤ i ≤ n}. Clearly, n has n! vertices and is 
regular of degree n − 1. Intuitively, if (a1a2···an, b1b2···bn) is an edge of n, then there exists 2 ≤ 
i ≤ n so that a1a2···an and b1b2···bn can be obtained from each other by reversing the leftmost i 
bits. When b1b2···bn = aiai−1···a1ai+1ai+2···an, (a1a2···an, b1b2···bn) is referred to as an i-dimensional 
edge of n. We use N
(i)(u) to denote the neighboring vertex of u  V(n) that is connected to u 
by an i-dimensional edge, and E(i)(n) to denote the set of all i-dimensional edges in n.  
For convenience, we use ui to denote the ith leftmost digit of a vertex u = u1u2···un, i.e., 
ui = ui, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It is not difficult to see that the subgraph of n induced by the set of 
vertices u with un = r forms a n−1, denoted by n
(r), where 1 ≤ r ≤ n. Thus, n contains n 
n−1’s, i.e., n
(1), n
(2), ···, n
(r). For I ⊆ {1, 2, ···, n}, we use n
I to denote the subgraph of 
n induced by the union of V(n
(r))'s for all r  I. Besides, we use Ep,q(n) to denote the set of 
those n-dimensional edges in n that connect n
(p) and n
(q), where p  q. it was shown in [26] 
that |Ep,q(n)| is equal to (n − 2)! where n  3, p, q  {1, 2, ···, n}, and p  q. 
The pancake graph is vertex symmetric, but not edge symmetric [29]. Further, the pancake 
graph is known to be pancyclic [26, 29], Hamiltonian-connected [43], and super connected [35]. 
In [39], an O(nlog n) time broadcasting algorithm and a constant time algorithm that can exchange 
the contents of any two sub-pancake graphs were proposed. In [16], [21], a complete binary tree 
and a hypercube were embedded into a pancake graph, respectively. In [6], the problem of job 
allocation and job migration on the pancake graph was studied.

Lemma 4. Suppose that P is a path in Sn
(q)  F, where n ≥ 4 and 1 ≤ q ≤ n. If |F| ≤ 2n  7 and P is 
Hamiltonian or of length (n  1)!  2, then P has an edge (u, v) with e(n)(u), e(n)(v)  F. 
Lemma 5. Suppose that A  {1, 2, …, n} and n ≥ 5. For any s  V(Sn
(p)) and t  V(Sn
(q)), there 
exists a longest Ps,t of length |A|  (n  1)!  1 or |A|  (n  1)!  2 in Sn[VA]  F, where p, q  A 
and p  q, provided the following two conditions hold. 
(C1) |Ep,q(Sn)  F|  (n  2)!/2 for all i, j  A and i  j. 
(C2) Sn
(r)  F is strongly Hamiltonian laceable for every r  A. 
Lemma 6. Suppose that s, t are two distinct vertices of Sn and (u, v)  E(Sn), where n ≥ 4. If {s, 
t}  {u, v}, then there exists a longest Ps,t in Sn that contains (u, v). 
Lemma 7. For any two distinct edges (s, t), (u, v) in Sn, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in Sn 
that contains both of them, where n ≥ 3. 
Theorem 1. If |F|  2n  7 and (Sn  F)  2, then Sn  F is strongly Hamiltonian laceable, where 
n  4. 
Results on Alternating Group Graphs 
We use AGn to denote the n-dimensional alternating group graph and F ( E(AGn)) to denote the 
set of faulty edges in AGn. 
Lemma 8. [25] AGn is (2n  6)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and (2n  7)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian- 
connected, where n ≥ 4. 
Lemma 9. [11] AGn is panconnected, where n ≥ 3. That is, for u, v  V(AGn) and u  v, there is 
a path Pu,v of length d(u, v) + k, where d(u, v) is the distance between u and v and 0 ≤ k ≤ |V|  
d(u, v)  1.

Lemma 15. Suppose that e1, e2  E(4) and e1  e2. Then, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in 
4  {e2} which contains e1. 
Lemma 16. Suppose that s, t  V(n), s  t, and s1 = t1, where n ≥ 4. For every (x, y)  E(n) 
with {x, y}  {s, t} = , there exists a Hamiltonian path Ps,t in n which contains (x, y). 
Theorem 3. n  F is Hamiltonian if |F| ≤ 2n  7 and (n  F)  2, where n ≥ 4. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
In this project, we investigated fault-free path/cycle embedding problems with edge faults on star 
graphs, alternating group graphs, and pancake graphs. When the random fault model is adopted, 
an n-dimensional star graph is known to be (n − 3)-edge-fault-tolerant strongly Hamiltonian 
laceable, where n ≥ 4. Under the conditional fault model and with the assumption of at least two 
non-faulty edges incident to each vertex, we showed that an n-dimensional star graph is (2n − 7)- 
edge-fault- tolerant strongly Hamiltonian laceable, where n ≥ 4. This result is optimal with 
respect to the number of edge faults tolerated. The assumption we made is practically meaningful, 
because the occurrence probability of two or more non-faulty edges incident to each vertex is 
very close to 1, even if n is small.  
When the random fault model is adopted, an n-dimensional alternating group graph is known 
to be (2n − 6)-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and (2n − 7)-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian- 
connected, where n ≥ 4. Under the conditional fault model and with the assumption of at least 
two non-faulty edges incident to each vertex, we showed that an n-dimensional alternating group 
graph is (4n − 13)-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian, where n ≥ 4. The result is also optimal with 
respect to the number of edge faults tolerated. Similarly, the assumption we made is practically 
meaningful. 
On the other hand, when the random fault model is adopted, an n-dimensional pancake 
graph is known to be (n − 3)-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and (n − 4)-edge-fault-tolerant
