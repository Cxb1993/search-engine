treat such an overall complicated flow with 
techniques of a hybrid grid system, which 
contained partially fixed and partially evolved 
grid nodes in analysis. In the model, the 
amount of layers applied to different solid 
surfaces is relaxed to conform to topography 
complexity, and all variables in each layer are 
transformed fully to a general grid system. 
The complete numerical model is finally con-

I. INTRODUCTION 
In this study, we attempt to calculate the 
complicated flow phenomena caused by a pier 
structure of circular cross-section located in the 
curved water channel and validate the numeri-
cal result with a simplified model test. To cover 
the three year’s work, we suggest investigating 
the bottom boundary layer flow interacted with 
the pier in the first year, the developing flow in 
a curved channel in the following year, and in 
the last year the combined flow for this pier in 
a curved channel. 
A bottom boundary layer flow past a verti-
cal circular cylinder that usually generates a 
complicated horseshoe vertical flow is primar-
ily due to the enforced flow separation by the 
bottom friction. The separated streamline from 
the bottom surface will reattach to the stagna-
tion line on the upper front edge of cylinder, 
and two limited separated streamlines along the 
bottom surface wraps around the cylinder to 
form a semi-open vortex region just like a 
horseshoe or necklace. Such a vortical flow 
zone can be found further to be partitioned to 
several sub-vortices inside it, if some saddle 
points exist in the front separated zone of the 
cylinder. As this horseshoe vortex system ex-
tends to the rear of the cylinder by those en-
closed dividing streamlines, the convective and 
diffused vorticity interacts with the separated 
wake shedding from the rear surface of the 
cylinder.  Using a multilayer and multiblock 
integral model to solve for the velocity and 
pressure in each layer, one can analyze this 
complicated flow pattern through a fixed curvi-
linear boundary-fitted grid system with locally 
grid refinement technique in some sub-regions. 
The proposed work will be carried out in the 
first year of study.  
As in the following year, we will consider 
a secondary flow being developed in an arbi-
trary curve channel with a super-elevated free

orders in differentiations of the depth-aver-
aged variables with respect to x  or t and the 
subscripts k can be interchanged without 
making any error in the formulation. Referring 
to the total depth 0KH z z= − , the fluid den-
sity ρ  and a typical velocity of approaching 
flow motionU , we may write down the fol-
lowing non-dimensional layer-averaged flow 
equations for the k-th layer. Integrating eqn (1) 
over k-th layer, we have 
k-th layer continuity equation 
1( ) /k k k k kw w h q−∇ ⋅ = − ≡u  (6) 
where ( , )k k ku v=u is the k-th layer-averaged 
horizontal velocity and 1,k kw w− are the verti-
cal velocities at the upper and lower layer in-
terfaces, respectively. Not that the net rate of 
vertical volume flux per unit layer thickness, 
designated as kq  in eqn (6), yields the inho-
mogeneous source in the horizontal dilation 
rate. This volume source is created at both 
layer interfaces and taken as the flux differ-
ence between two interfaces. Integration of 
eqn (3) with the help of eqn (5) yields 
k-th layer vertical momentum equation

where /Re UH ν=  is the Reynolds number, 
kw  is the k-th layer-averaged vertical velocity, 
and, again, the non-homogeneous vertical 
force source per unit thickness is denoted by 
the interfacial difference between 
2 ( / )k k z k kkf w w Re w′ ′= − −∇⋅u  (8) 
and 1kf − , which are generated at two layer in-
terfaces due to the net rate of vertical mo-
mentum flux, vertical normal viscous stress 
and vertical sub-layer scaled (SLS) turbulence 
in disturbed momentum flux. Within the k-th 
layer, the vertical non-uniform velocities de-
viate their layer-averaged quantities as 
( ) ( ), ( ) ( )k kz z w z w w z′ ′= + = +u u u , 
for 1k kz z z −≤ ≤ ,which leads to the verti-
cally-unresolved nonlinear stress-like effects by 
this layer-averaged process, similar to unre-
solved Reynolds’ turbulent stresses by the av-
eraging time scale. All those stress-like quanti-
ties result from the nonlinear convection of 
momentum or energy transport process. In ad-
dition, in eqn (8) the vertical velocity gradi-
ent ( )z kw  in vertical normal viscous stress is 
specified directly as the vertical variation of 
vertical velocity at the interface, but not taken 
by the trivial vertical gradient of interfacial 
vertical velocity ( )k zw ,  because ( )kw x  de-
pends only on the horizontal coordinates. Tak-
ing layer integration of eqn (2) with the aid of 
eqn (4), we get 
k-th layer horizontal momentum equations

equation (of two horizontal components) are 
denoted by the differences of

and 1ks − . The horizontal components of SLS 
turbulence and the vertical gradient of shear 
stresses /z k Reu are similarly included in the 
interfacial source, eqn (10). It is known that 
although the layer-averaging processes are ex-
act integration treatment without introduction 
of errors in use, their resulting equations are 
usually required the suitable model to get good 
approximated values to relate the interface val-
ues to the corresponding averaged values and, 
moreover, the model also suffers the closure 
problem during modeling the nonlinear SGS

namely, the convective-diffusive transport 
equations and the Poisson’s equations. This 
means that only two sets of the discretization 
coefficients are needed for these five variables 
to solve the entire system. In addition, when 
one seeks to calculate the problem of irregular 
boundary shape, a boundary-conforming grid 
system is easily transformed through the usage 
of a general 2D curvilinear coordinate system. 
II.3. Closure relationship between layer 
averaged and interfacial variables 
It necessary to use interpolating function 
to formulate the layer averaged variables θ  
and interfacial variables 1,k kθ θ−  where ( )zθ  
represents for variables such as , ,u v w or p . A 
cubic spline is applied for this purpose due to 
its high accuracy and smoothness up to the 
second derivative across layers.

The values of kθ ′  and kθ ′′  can be solved by 
use of the continuity conditions of the first 
derivative at all interior knots. Therefore, the

averaged value ofθ in eqn(19) leads to

Once one obtains numerical solution of layer 
average of kθ  for the present layer, then one 
has interfacial value of kθ  if the solution of 
1kθ − are found in advance at its neighbor layer. 
II.4. Boundary-Conforming Grid 
Consider a general (two-dimensional) curvilin-
ear coordinate system 1 2( , ) ( , )ξ η ξ ξ=  (i=1, or 
2) with covariant and contra-variant base vec-
tors defined, respectively, by 
/ ,ii i ii ξξ ξ= ∂ ∂ = = ∇g r r g  in which r  is 
the position vector. The gradient of a function 
ψ  and the divergence of a vector are written 
by 
, ( ) /i i ii ij ijg Ju Jξ ξ ξψ ψ ψ∇ = = ∇⋅ =g g u . (21) 
where the contra-variant metric tensors 
are ij i jg = ⋅g g  , 1, 2for ori j = . Combination 
of two operators in eqn (13) yields the Lapla-
cian of a function

In the present study, we will calculate the 
bottom flow around a vertical circular cylinder 
which generates the three-dimensional vertical 
flow pattern, known as horseshoe vortex flow, 
by the multilayer model. The layer boundaries 
 8
where 12 12 0g g= =  have been used in our 
orthogonal coordinates with eqn (23). In con-
sequence, the wall vorticity can be obtained. 
As we perform the calculation across one 
layer, we get all the interfacial sources by it-
eration. Then we keep proceeding to the next 
layer until it reaches the top or bottom bound-
ary and finally we impose the boundary con-
dition there. The satisfactory solutions are 
thus required to iterate through all layers over 
the total depth. 
Finite-analytic formulation is used to dis-
cretize the governing equations. For brevity, 
we refer here out previous published works 
without showing the detail of this method. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Consider a uniform flow of unit velocity 
past a vertical circular cylinder of unit radius 
mounted on a flat bottom. The flow domain in 
numerical calculation is truncated to the re-
gion of 6.35 32.97,x− ≤ ≤ | | 10,y < and 
0 5.z≤ ≤  The results of 2D steady viscous 
flow at Re=30 passing a circular cylinder 
without the bottom surface are obtained from 
a 2D stream function-vorticity model, as illus-
trated in Fig 2. This solution will be used as 
an initial condition for our present 3d flow 
model. Unfortunately, this numerical model is 
not stable to get the reasonable solution so far. 
It requires more effort to overcome the diffi-
culty we suffered. 
IV CONCLUSIONS 
In the present study, the multilayer model us-
ing the Helmholtz decomposition in layer ve-
locity gives simple formulations of two typical 
2D PDE’s to be solved. A cubic spline inter-
polation for all variables is used between in-
ter-layers so that the continuity up to second 
derivates of flow variables is kept. The nu-
merical result did not give a reasonable pre-
diction on the horseshoe vortex pattern ahead 
of bottom pier problem. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
We are regretted that the continuous research 
did not obtain the support from NSC due to the 
reviewer’s suggestion. Further result of this 
self-supported project will be hopefully found 
in other published paper in the near future.
