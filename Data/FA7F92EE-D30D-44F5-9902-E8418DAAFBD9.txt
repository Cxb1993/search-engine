increased correlation among code bits can be obtained by increasing the constraint length.
In this report, we are interested in increasing the correlation among code bits by providing
correlation among consecutive codewords of random-like block codes such as binary turbo
codes, turbo coded modulation and random coded MIMO. In chapter 2, we first investigate
the case of binary codes include the conventional binary turbo codes [1] and the multiple
turbo codes [3]. In particular, we consider a binary code T which is implemented by serially
concatenating a multiplexer, a multilevel delay processor, and a signal mapper to the encoder
of a binary turbo code C. With the delay processor and signal mapper, memory is introduced
between two adjacent turbo codewords in T . Hence, this coding is a kind of turbo coding
scheme with interblock memory. To provide a variety of irregularity, we can construct TC
which is obtained by passing only a fraction of C through the multilevel delay processor and
the signal mapper. Two decoding methods, i.e., iterative decoding within a single codeword
(IDSC) and iterative decoding between adjacent codewords (IDAC) are proposed to decode
TC . Usually, IDAC can provide better error performance with higher complexity and longer
decoding delay as compared to IDSC. For all the cases we have investigated, there always
exists a binary TC which is better than the original C. In chapter 3, Extension to turbo
coded modulation system Υ with interblock memory is proposed, similar advantage can be
obtained.
Recently, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with Nt transmit antennas and Nr
receive antennas are attractive for their capability to provide spatial diversity to combat
fading by using either space-time block codes (STBC) [54][55] or space-time trellis codes
(STTC) [53]. In chapter 4, we also propose a turbo coded BLAST system Γ with near-
capacity performance, which is implemented by introducing the delay diversity scheme in
[51][52] with block delay between the BLAST mapper and turbo encoder. The relative delay
between transmit antennas for the case of Nt = 2 is DB symbols instead of one symbol,
where DB is usually a significant fraction of the length of a turbo codeword. The decoding
thresholds (or pinch-off limits) of Γ are derived by using EXIT charts with some assumptions.
We show that, unlike Γ0, the EXIT curves of detector and turbo decoder in Γ can match
well. Hence, unlike Γ0, Γ can achieve the near-capacity performance for the case of Nt > Nr
which is also confirmed by BER (bit error rate) results. As compared to irregular low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes or irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) codes optimized for MIMO
systems [48][50], Γ can achieve comparable performance for both the cases of Nt > Nr and
Nt = Nr. Conclusions are given in the chapter 5.

the distance spectra). Hence, the error performance at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
very poor.
For a random-like block code [1]-[9], the error performance can be improved by increasing
the block length, which implies more correlation among code bits. There is a construction of
random-like code that is not in block form, called LDPC convolutional code [31], for which
increased correlation among code bits can be obtained by increasing the constraint length.
In this report, we are interested in increasing the correlation among code bits by providing
correlation among consecutive codewords of random-like block codes. In particular, we
consider a coding scheme T which is implemented by serially concatenating a multiplexer,
a multilevel delay processor, and a signal mapper to the encoder of a binary turbo code C.
With the delay processor and signal mapper, memory is introduced between two adjacent
turbo codewords in T . Hence, this coding is a kind of turbo coding scheme with interblock
memory. T can be either a binary code or a coded modulation depending on the design of
the signal mapper. In this chapter, we only investigate the case of binary codes.
To obtain satisfactory error performance in either the error-floor region or the waterfall
region, we must jointly consider the distance property and the error coefficients for T . The
introduction of interblock memory in T is equivalent to providing extra checks to the code
bits of each codeword of C through the bits of the adjacent codewords of C. It has been shown
in [7] that designing the degree distributions of variable and check nodes of irregular LDPC
codes can achieve better pinch-off limit (threshold) than that of regular LDPC. Following
a similar idea, we would like to construct a coding scheme with better pinch-off limit than
that of T by designing the percentage of the checks which are provided from adjacent turbo
codewords of C. Hence, we provide a construction TC , which is obtained by the combination
of two parts. The first part is obtained by passing a fraction, PIB, 0 ≤ PIB ≤ 1, of the
code bits of C through the delay processor and signal mapper and the second part is the
remaining fraction, i.e., 1−PIB, of the code bits of C. By varying the fraction, PIB, we can
have TC with various performance in the error-floor and water-fall regions. Note that T is a
special case of TC with PIB = 1 and C is a special case of TC with PIB = 0.
For TC , we propose two suboptimum decoding methods. The first is IDSC (iterative
decoding within a single codeword of C) and the second is IDAC (iterative decoding between
adjacent codewords of C). IDSC is a two-stage decoding which employs a demapper in the
first stage and a turbo decoder of C in the second stage. Using IDSC to decode TC will result
in significant error coefficients which will degrade the error performance of TC . The reason
of degradation is that in the check-node operation defined by the signal mapper, we do not
utilize the extrinsic information provided by the following codeword of turbo code C that
is correlated with the current codeword of C. To alleviate this problem, we can use IDAC
which efficiently utilizes this extrinsic information. Usually, using IDAC, we can achieve
9
block delay. For an m-level delay processor, the relationship between vj(t, k) and sj(t, k)
is sj(t, k) = vj(t − (m − j), k), 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 0 ≤ k ≤ λ − 1. The relation between −→s , −→v
and −→a for the case of m = 2 is given in Fig. 2. The rates of T and C are the same. For
T , the insertion of delay processor introduces interblock memory since z¯(t) and z¯(t+ 1) are
correlated.
The signal mapper maps a binarym-tuple sˆ(t, k) into a binarym-tuple zˆ(t, k) = ω(sˆ(t, k))
= sˆ(t, k)M ∈ Ω0, whereM is a binarym×m nonsingular matrix and Ω0 = {0, 1}m. According
to sˆ = (s1, s2, · · · , sm) and zˆ = ω(sˆ) ∈ Ω0, we can construct an m-level partition chain
Ω0/Ω1/Ω2/ · · · /Ωm, where si, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, is the label of the partitioning Ωi−1/Ωi, according
to the set-partitioning principle in [25][26].
Let ω(sˆ) and ω(sˆ′) denote two signal points which are in the same coset of Ωj−1, but in
distinct cosets of Ωj labelled by sj = 1 and s
′
j = 0, respectively. Let ∆(ω(sˆ), ω(sˆ
′)) represent
the bit-wise Hamming distance between ω(sˆ) and ω(sˆ′). We define ∆j to be the least one
of all the possible nonzero ∆(ω(sˆ), ω(sˆ′)), and nj to be the average number of signal points
ω(sˆ′) satisfying ∆(ω(sˆ), ω(sˆ′)) = ∆j. We have ∆m ≥ ∆m−1 ≥ · · · ≥ ∆1.
Example 2.1 : Let m = 2, Ω0 = {0, 1}2 and M =
(
1 0
1 1
)
. We have z1 = s1 ⊕ s2 and
z2 = s2. We have ∆1 = min{∆(ω(sˆ), ω(sˆ′)) : sˆ ∈ {(1, 0), (1, 1)}; sˆ′ ∈ {(0, 0), (0, 1)}} = 1.
Both ω(sˆ = (1, 0)) and ω(sˆ = (1, 1)) are possible neighbors labelled with s1 = 1 which are
at a Hamming distance of 1 from ω(sˆ′ = (0, 0)) that is labelled with s′1 = 0. Hence, we have
n1 = 2. Similarly, we have ∆2 = 2 and n2 = 1. ¤
In [30], a binary stream-oriented turbo code (SOTC) which is implemented by using a
convolutional interleaver in a conventional turbo encoder was proposed. Although convo-
lutional interleavers are employed in both SOTC and T , and the outputs of both T and
SOTC are continuous, the encoding of T is totally different from SOTC. In particular, T has
explicit boundary and hence is suitable for package transmission, while SOTC is suitable for
stream-oriented applications.
2.2.2 Distance property
With the delay processor and the signal mapper, we can check the distance properties of the
resultant code T in a manner similar to that used in [23]. Let −→v = {· · · , v¯(−1), v¯(0), · · · } be
a weight-d binary sequence that is the multiplexed version of a turbo coded sequence −→a from
C. Let −→z and −→z0 be the binary output sequences associated with −→v and −→0 , respectively,
where
−→
0 is the all zero sequence. Let ∆T (
−→z ,−→z0 ) be the bit-wise Hamming distance between
the output sequences −→z and −→z0 corresponding sequences −→v and −→0 , respectively.
Assume v¯(t) = 0¯ for t < 0 and v¯(0) 6= 0¯, where 0¯ is the all zero codeword consisting of λ

contributes 4 = 2s1(1,1)2s1(1,2) = n
v1(0,1)
1 n
v1(0,2)
1 , neighbors in counting NT (∆T (
−→z ,−→z0 ) = 8). ¤
Now consider the general case. If vj(0, k) = 1, then there are nj possible neighbors
labelled with sj(m − j, k) = 1 which are at a Hamming distance ∆j from ω(0ˆ). Hence, the
code sequence, −→v , contributes
nT (
−→v ,−→0 ) = Πmj=1Πλ−1k=0[nj]sj(m−j,k) = Πmj=1Πλ−1k=0[nj]vj(0,k) (2.2)
neighbors in counting NT (∆T (
−→z ,−→z0 )). In case that we have the a priori information about
a¯(1), a¯(2), · · · , we are able to reduce nT (−→v ,−→0 ).
2.2.3 Hybrid turbo coding with interblock memory
For a turbo-like code, its error floor performance can be roughly estimated by its minimum
distance and the associated error coefficient (or multiplicity). However, its error performance
at the waterfall region is affected by the method of suboptimum decoding, which determines
the convergence behavior of message passing. Through the investigation of many cases, we
find that T has better error performance at the error floor region i.e., at the high signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and worse error performance at the waterfall region, i.e., at the
low SNR, as compared to the associated turbo code C. We can trade the error performance
at the error floor region with the error performance at the waterfall region by a proper
combination of T and C. In addition, for very long codes, a proper combination of T and
C can sometimes significantly improve the convergence behavior at the waterfall region, i.e.,
the pinch-off limit, as compared to either T or C.
In this report, the combination of T and C, is denoted by TC . For TC , z¯(t) = [zˆ(t, 0),
zˆ(t, 1),· · · , zˆ(t, λ− 1)], is composed of two parts. The first part is obtained by passing only
a fraction, PIB, 0 ≤ PIB ≤ 1, of a codeword of C through the delay processor and signal
mapper. Let us consider PIB = 1/2. We have zˆ(t, k) = sˆ(t, k)M for k = 0, 2, · · · , λ − 2,
where sj(t, k) = vj(t− (m− j), k) for 1 ≤ j ≤ m. The second part is simply the remaining
part of the codeword of C. Hence, in case of PIB = 1/2, we have zj(t, k) = vj(t, k), for k
= 1, 3, · · · , λ− 1. The arrangement of the two parts with parameters given in Example 2.1
can be depicted by the Tanner graph of TC as shown in Fig. 2.3.
As to the general PIB case, suppose that B divides λ and
q
B
= PIB. For the first part,
we have zˆ(t, k) = sˆ(t, k)M for k = lB, lB + 1, · · · , lB + q − 1, 0 ≤ l ≤ λ
B
− 1, where sj(t, k)
= vj(t − (m − j), k) for 1 ≤ j ≤ m. For the second part, we have zj(t, k) = vj(t, k), for
1 ≤ j ≤ m, k = lB + q, · · · , (l + 1)B − 1, 0 ≤ l ≤ λ
B
− 1. By varying the fraction, PIB, we
can have TC with various error performance, while the rate of TC remains unchanged.
For TC , the distance property can be derived in a way similar to deriving (2.1). We then
13
2.2.5 Iterative decoding between adjacent codewords
For TC with PIB > 0, IDSC results in large error coefficients as indicated in equations (2.2)
and (2.4). The error coefficients can be reduced by message passing between two adjacent
turbo code words, a¯(t) and a¯(t+1). This decoding is referred to as iterative decoding between
adjacent codewords (IDAC). We now present the decoding of a¯(t) for IDAC with m = 2 and
PIB = 1. Suppose that LD,e(a¯(t− 1)) has been obtained.
Step 1 With LD,e(a¯(t)) = 0 (equivalently LM,a(v¯(t)) = 0), we use IDSC to decode a¯(t+ 1)
and obtain LD,e(a¯(t+ 1)).
Step 2 Based on LD,e(a¯(t + 1)) obtained in Step 1, LD,e(a¯(t − 1)), and LM,a(v¯(t))=0, the
demapper calculates LM,p(v¯(t)). The decoder of C then uses LM,p(v¯(t)) as LD,c(a¯(t))
to decode a¯(t) and obtain LD,e(a¯(t)).
Step 3 Based on LD,e(a¯(t)) obtained in Step 2, we use IDSC to re-decode a¯(t + 1) and
update LD,e(a¯(t+ 1)).
Step 4 Based on updated LD,e(a¯(t+1)) obtained in Step 3, LD,e(a¯(t−1)), and LM,a(v¯(t))=0,
the demapper calculates LM,p(v¯(t)). The decoder of C uses updated LM,p(v¯(t)) as new
channel values LD,c(a¯(t)) to decode a¯(t) and obtain LD,e(a¯(t)).
Step 5 After repeating Steps 3 and 4 for NIDAC − 1 times, we can recover a¯(t) and obtain
LD,e(a¯(t)).
For each turbo decoding of C, NI iterations are used. From Fig. 2.3, we can see that
the IDSC can be viewed as a scheduling for decoding a¯(t) (equivalently, v¯(t)) over a window
covering z¯(t) and z¯(t + 1), while IDAC can be viewed as a scheduling for decoding a¯(t)
(equivalently, v¯(t)) over a window covering z¯(t), z¯(t+ 1) and z¯(t+ 2).
2.3 Conventional Binary Turbo Coding with Interblock
Memory
In the section, we use the rate-1/2 conventional binary turbo code [1] as the code C in
constructing TC . This C is composed of two recursive systematic convolutional codes, i.e.,
RSC1 and RSC2 respectively. The parameters of m, Ω0, and M given in Example 2.1 are
used. For PIB ∈ {1/2, 1}, the relation between input bits and output bits of the multiplexer
is given by v1(t, k) = u(t, k), v2(t, k) = p1(t, k) for even k, and v2(t, k) = p2(t, k) for odd
k, where u(t, k), p1(t, k) and p2(t, k) are message bit, parity bit of RSC1, and parity bit of
RSC2, respectively. The interleaver size is K = λ. For PIB /∈ {0, 1/2, 1}, the parity bits of
15
which may be smaller than or equal to NC(d2,min(C)).
2.3.1.2 Estimation of asymptotic BER performance at high SNR
From the analysis of effective minimum distance and the associated multiplicity, we expect
that the asymptotic performance of TC at the error floor region will be better than C for
PIB > 0 in case that optimum decoding is used. To see whether this trend is still true in
case that the suboptimum decoding methods proposed in this report are used, we estimate
the low weight part of the weight spectra of TC resultant from not only the weight-2 message
but also the weight-3 message. We consider the case of an S-random interleaver of size
K=1024 with S = 1. We use equations (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), and (2.4) to calculate the distance
spectra of T and TC . The effective minimum distances d2,min(TC) with PIB = 0, 1 and 1/2
are 6, 10, and 8, respectively. The associated multiplicities, NTC (d2,min(TC)), are 3, 3, and 3,
respectively. Let d3,min(TC) denote the minimum weight of sequences in TC resultant from
the weight-3 message sequences. Then, d3,min(TC) with PIB = 0, 1 and 1/2 are 10, 17, and
12, respectively. The associated multiplicities, NTC (d3,min(TC)), are 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
Since IDAC takes the a priori information of a¯(t+ 1) into account, we assume that, for the
high SNR condition, the associated multiplicities are close to those for optimum decoding
as just derived. As to IDSC, its multiplicities, NTC (d2,min(TC)), associated to d2,min(TC)
with PIB = 1 and 1/2 are 12 and 4, respectively, and the multiplicities, NTC (d3,min(TC)),
associated to d3,min(TC) with PIB = 1 and 1/2 are 16 and 2, respectively.
Using the equation for BER given in [34], the asymptotic performance calculated based
on the NTC (d2,min(TC)) and NTC (d3,min(TC)) for IDSC and IDAC respectively and the BER
obtained from simulation are shown in Fig. 2.4. We see that the asymptotic performance of
TC is dominated by sequences encoded from low-weight message like the case of conventional
turbo codes C. In addition, we can achieve better asymptotic performance by increasing
PIB since increasing PIB results in higher effective minimum distance α
∗
` + d2,min(C). Note
that α∗` is an increasing function of PIB since α` is an increasing function of PIB. The
suboptimum decoding IDAC can achieve BER performance at the error floor region which
is close to that predicted by using the optimum decoding. The BER performance of the
suboptimum decoding IDSC is inferior to that of IDAC due to the increased multiplicities.
At the error floor region, the loss of BER performance of IDSC as compared to IDAC is
increased as PIB increases.
2.3.1.3 BER for TC with various PIB
From Fig. 2.4, we see that TC with PIB =1, i.e., T , has the best error floor and the worst
convergence behavior at low SNR. In contrast, TC with PIB =0, i.e., C, has the worst error
17
obtain Ie1(v¯1(t)) for various Ia1(v¯2(t+1)). Similarly, we run simulation on decoding a¯(t+1)
with NI = 60 iterations to obtain Ie2(v¯2(t+1)) for various Ia2(v¯1(t)). From the EXIT curves
of TC using IDAC, we can find that TC using IDAC can converge to a large value of mutual
information with a small number of interblock iterations, i.e., NIDAC . The pinch-off limits
for TC with PIB = 1 and 1/2 using IDAC are 0.69 and 0.50 dB, respectively.
From Fig. 2.6, we see that for Eb/N0 = 0.7 dB, the region which is the bottleneck for
the EXIT curves of C is widely open for the EXIT curves of T and the region which is the
bottleneck for the EXIT curves of T is widely open for the EXIT curves of C. Hence, a proper
mixture of T and C, e.g., TC with 0 < PIB < 1, can achieve EXIT curves with wide enough
tunnel for the exchange of information. This characteristic enables the iterative decoder of
TC with a proper PIB to converge at lower SNR and hence achieve a lower pinch-off limit
as compared to T and C. To see which PIB is the best choice for the 4-state TC considering
the pinch-off limit, we investigate the pinch-off limits of 4-state TC with various PIB. The
pinch-off limits of 4-state TC with PIB given as

using IDSC are 0.66 dB, 0.64 dB, 0.61 dB, 0.57 dB, 0.55 dB, 0.54 dB, 0.55 dB, 0.56 dB, 0.60
dB and 0.64 dB, respectively. In case IDAC is used, the pinch-off limits are 0.69 dB, 0.64
dB, 0.59 dB, 0.52 dB, 0.50 dB, 0.50 dB, 0.54 dB, 0.55 dB, 0.64 dB and 0.69 dB, respectively.
Compared to the pinch-off limits obtained by using IDSC, we observe that the advantage of
information exchange between a¯(t) and a¯(t + 1) in IDAC will diminish for very long code
lengths.
We investigate the pinch-off limits of TC with 8-state, 16-state, and 64-state RSC1 and
RSC2. The generator matrices (1, 15/13)8, (1, 21/37)8, and (1, 141/110)8 obtained from [36]
are considered. Only slight improvement is observed. For example, the pinch-off limit is 0.39
dB for the 64-state TC with PIB = 1/16 and IDSC, while the pinch-off limit is 0.42 dB for
the conventional 64-state turbo code C.
To verify the pinch-off limit (or turbo cliff) for TC obtained by EXIT charts, we perform
BER simulation with very long interleavers (K = 262144). The results are given in Fig. 2.8.
We see that the 4-state C, 4-state TC with PIB = 1/2 using IDSC, and 4-state TC with PIB =
1/2 using IDAC, can achieve BER of 10−6 at Eb/No of 0.84, 0.68 and 0.575 dB, respectively.
The associated pinch-off limits obtained from the EXIT chart are 0.69, 0.54, and 0.5 dB,
respectively.
In our EXIT chart analysis, Ia(a¯(t − 1)) = 1 is assumed. In the BER simulation, we
do not use such assumption and in addition we consider only finite NI for IDSC and IDAC
and finite NIDAC for IDAC. Hence, the pinch-off limits for TC obtained from the EXIT
chart analysis are better than those obtained from the BER simulation. However, the EXIT
analysis does provide valuable information for the design of TC . For example, the EXIT
chart analysis for the 4-state TC shows that there is significant room for obtaining better
19
turbo codes C of the same K. The BER curves of 16-state conventional binary turbo codes
with K = 1024 and 3072 respectively are given in Fig. 2.9 for comparison.
Remember that in Fig. 2.4 and in Fig. 2.5, BER of TC for K = 1024 and K = 8192
are provided, where the average interleavers, i.e., S-random interleavers with S = 1, are
used. In Fig. 2.9, the BER results of TC are provided for S-random interleavers of size K
= 1024 with S = 18 and for S-random interleavers of size K = 8192 with S = 32. From
Fig. 2.4, Fig. 2.5, and Fig. 2.9, we observe that the error performance of TC with PIB =
1, 1/2 and 0, in the error-floor region can be improved by using a designed interleaver for
short-to-moderate interleaver sizes. We also observe that the trends of increasing PIB from
0 to 1 are similar for both the average interleaver, i.e., S-random interleaver with S = 1,
and the designed interleaver.
2.3.2.2 BER results for long interleavers
From Fig. 2.4, Fig. 2.5, and Fig. 2.9, we observe that the gain in error performance achieved
by using designed interleavers is decreased as the interleaver length K increases. Hence, we
use S=1 for long interleavers. Simulation results for TC with long interleavers (K=32768)
using either IDSC or IDAC and conventional turbo codes C are given in Fig. 2.8. Some gain
can be obtained by using IDAC as compared to IDSC for TC with PIB of either 1 or 1/2.
Based on similar decoding delay, TC with either PIB = 1 or 1/2 can achieve better error
performance as compared to C. In addition, using a 4-state TC with K = 32768, PIB = 1/2
and NIDAC = 2, we can have BER ≈ 10−6 at Eb/No = 0.7 dB, which is a bit better than
that of the original 16-state turbo code [1] with K=65536.
From curve B3 in Fig. 2.8, we find that a 4-state C with K = 98304 can achieve a BER
of 5× 10−6 at Eb/No = 0.90 dB. However, from Fig. 2.5, we find that 4-state TC with PIB =
4
8
and K = 8192 can achieve the same BER at Eb/No = 0.85 dB. In addition, from Fig. 2.8,
we see that using IDAC for 4-state TC with PIB = 1/2 and K = 32768 can achieve BER
much better than that obtained from 4-state C with K = 262144. We can conclude that the
gain of introducing memory between codewords of turbo code C is sometimes more than the
gain of simply increasing the interleaver size of C.
2.3.3 Effect of the delay processor
T can be thought of as a serial concatenation with an inner code and outer code respectively
defined by the signal mapping matrix M and the conventional turbo code C but with an
outer interleaver which has a regular interleaver structure composed of the delay processor
and the multiplexer. If we replace the delay processor and the multiplexer with a length-
2K random interleaver, then we have a coding scheme TR which is the same as that of
21
mostly similar to that for TC using the conventional binary turbo code. However, there is a
remarkable difference. We can see that the BER performance of TC with PIB > 0 using IDSC
is not better than that of C, while the improvement of IDAC over IDSC is very significant.
This indicates that there exist code sequences leading to large multiplicities for suboptimum
decoding of a¯(t) in case the a priori information of a¯(t + 1) is not available. The reason is
as follows. In case of using a conventional binary turbo code C, we can deploy the message
bits of a¯(t) into v¯1(t) and the parity bits of a¯(t) into v¯2(t). Hence, from the analysis given in
Section III.A, the multiplicity of TC associated to codeword a¯(t) encoded from the low-weight
message of C will not be very large even if we use IDSC. Since MTC is not systematic, the
analysis based on a¯(t) encoded from the low-weight message given in Section III.A can not
directly apply. In particular, we have no control over the weight of bits in v¯1(t) and the
multiplicity resultant from v¯1(t). Hence, using MTC as C, the multiplicity resultant from
v¯1(t) can be significant if we apply IDSC for decoding. However, using IDAC, the increased
multiplicities can be removed. Hence, applying IDAC for TC with PIB of 1 (or 1/2), we can
achieve BER much better than C in either the case of using the conventional binary turbo
code as C or the case of using MTC as C.
We may refer to the curves in Fig. 2.8, Fig. 2.9, and Fig. 2.10 to compare the BER
performances of TC using the 4-state conventional turbo code and the 2-state MTC described
in this section as C. In case of IDSC and K = 1024, using MTC is apparently inferior to
using the conventional turbo code. For K = 1024 and IDAC, using MTC and using the
conventional turbo code have similar BER performance. For very long MTC, we see that
C and TC with PIB = 1 and 1/2 using IDAC can achieve a BER of 10
−6 at Eb/No of
0.725 dB, 0.58 dB, and 0.55 dB, respectively. In contrast, for very long conventional turbo
code, the associated Eb/No are 0.84 dB, 0.68 dB, and 0.575 dB, respectively. Hence, for the
investigated cases, using the MTC provides some BER advantage over using the conventional
turbo code for the very long code condition.
2.5 Conclusions
In this chapter, we propose to provide correlation between codewords of a binary turbo
code C by introducing interblock memory. Binary codes, TC , can be constructed based
on various degrees of interblock memory. Two suboptimum decoding methods for TC have
been proposed. One is designed based on iterative decoding within a single binary turbo
codeword, called IDSC. The other is designed based on iterative decoding between two
adjacent binary turbo codewords, called IDAC. As compared to IDSC, IDAC usually provides
better BER performance with the cost of higher decoding complexity. The cases of using the
conventional binary turbo code and using multiple turbo code as C have been respectively

Interblock Memory for Turbo Coded
Modulation
3.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we investigate the performance of binary turbo coding with in-
terblock memory for which the encoding is implemented by serially concatenating a mul-
tiplexer, a multilevel delay processor, and a binary signal mapper to a conventional turbo
encoder. The scheme of binary turbo coding with interblock memory can also be used to
construct coded modulation Υ if the binary signal mapper is replaced by the signal mapper
for a modulation constellation.
For the proposed turbo coded modulation system Υ with interblock memory, there are
two specific constructions of special interest. The error floors of these two constructions can
be roughly estimated by the associated effective minimum distances [35]. The pinch-off SNR
for both constructions can also be derived by the EXIT charts [36] under some additional
assumptions. In particular, we can design a rate 2 bits/symbol 8PSK Υ with a pinch-off
limit of 3.05 dB which is slightly better than that of coded modulation based on irregular
LDPC codes [18] and is only 0.15 dB away from the capacity (2.9 dB).
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Encoding and decoding includ-
ing IDSC and IDAC for turbo coded modulation with interblock memory are described in
Section 3.2. Distance property and two specific constructions are also given in Section 3.2.
In Section 3.3, we present simulation results and compare the performances such as BER,
decoding complexity, and decoding delay with the original turbo coded modulation .Conclu-
sions are given in Section 3.4.

−→z ,−→z0 ) between sequences −→z and −→z0 in equation (2.1) is modified to be

∆j(γj(0, k), 0ˆj) ≡ DLB,Υ(−→v ,−→0 ). (3.1)
where 0ˆj denotes the all zero (ij − ij−1)-tuple.
We can use either IDSC or IDAC to decode Υ. Note that, for either IDSC or IDAC, the
extrinsic value for each labelling bit is calculated in bit level rather than in symbol level in
the MAP demapper since the bit-by-bit decoding is used in the turbo decoding of C. In
IDSC, the increased number of neighbors given in equation (2.2) is modified to be
nΥ(
−→v ,−→0 ) = Πqj=1Πij−ij−1k=1 Πλ−1`=0 [ηij−1+kj ]vij−1+k(0,`). (3.2)
The increased error coefficient can also be reduced by IDAC.
3.2.2 Two specific constructions
We now consider the design of TCM with rate of 2 bits per 8PSK symbol. Let C be a
rate-2/3 conventional binary turbo code with an interleaver size of K message bits. Let
a¯(t)= [u¯(t), p¯(t)] be the t-th codeword of C, where p¯(t)=[p1(t, 0), p2(t, 1), p1(t, 4), p2(t, 5),
· · · , p1(t,K − 2) p2(t,K − 1)].
Construction A:We use the parameters ofm, Ω, q, {i1, i2} and the signal labelling as given
in Example 3.2. The relation between inputs and outputs of the multiplexer is described
by v1(t, k) = u(t, 2k) and v2(t, k) = u(t, 2k + 1). In addition, v3(t, k) = p1(t, 2k) for even
k and v3(t, k) = p2(t, 2k − 1) for odd k. Let λ = K/2. The relation between inputs and
outputs of the delay processor is described by s1(t, k) = v1(t− 1, k), s2(t, k) = v2(t, k), and
s3(t, k) = v3(t, k), k = 0, 1, · · · , λ−1. The relation between −→s , −→v and −→a is given in Fig. 3.1.
The resultant code Υ is a TCM with rate 2 bits per 8PSK symbol. ¤
We may consider a modified version of Construction A which is denoted as Construc-
tion A’ by employing Ungerboeck’s labelling instead of mixed labelling and a three-level
delay processor, i.e., m = q = 3 and λ = K/2 which yields {∆1(1, 0) = 0.586,∆2(1, 0) =
2,∆3(1, 0) = 4} and {η11 = 2, η22 = 2, η33 = 1}. Although the asymptotic performance is quite
good, {η11 = 2, η22 = 2, η33 = 1} implies a dense distance spectrum and hence causes poor error
performance by using IDSC for the SNR of interested to us. In addition, the decoding delay
will be increased. Although we can use IDAC to decode Construction A’ for reducing the
increased error coefficients, we must respectively apply IDSC to a¯(t), a¯(t+ 1), and a¯(t+ 2)
to sufficiently reduce the increased error coefficients and hence the decoding complexity is
significantly increased. Moreover, the decoding delay is further increased.
Suppose that we switch the positions of u(t, 2k) and p1(t, 2k), and switch the positions
of u(t, 2(k + 1)) and p2(t, 2k + 1), where k is an even integer. Then, the message for which
35
improved by increasing PIB. Construction A or B can achieve much better error performance
with higher decoding complexity by using IDAC as compared to using IDSC. In addition,
Construction A is suitable for low BER (or high SNR) conditions while Construction B is
suitable for moderate BER (or moderate SNR) conditions.
We perform BER simulation for Construction B with largeK to see whether the proposed
TTCM can achieve the near-capacity performance. The simulation results are given in
Fig. 3.3. We also perform the analysis of EXIT charts based on the same method and
conditions used in binary TC to obtain the pinch-off limits. The results of BER in the error
floor region and pinch-off limits are also given in Table 3.1. Also included in Table 3.1 are
the simulation results of the TTCM constructed from [10]. We see that, Construction B
with K = 262144 can achieve a BER of 3.18 × 10−8 at Eb/No = 3.14 dB which is slightly
better than the threshold (pinch-off SNR) of 3.15 dB for the irregular LDPC-CM given in
[18]. In addition, the pinch-off limits of 4-state and 16-state Construction B using IDAC are
3.10 dB and 3.05 dB, which are only 0.20 and 0.15 dB from the constraint capacity (2.9 dB),
respectively.
3.4 Conclusions
The performance of conventional TTCM [10] and turbo coded modulation with interblock
memory is investigated. Turbo coded modulation with interblock memory can be constructed
based on various degrees of interblock memory and decoded by using either IDSC or IDAC.
Simulation shows that for short-to-long code lengths, we can design Coded modulation TC
to have better error performance in the error floor regions as compared to the conventional
TTCM [10]. I n addition, we can construct binary TC such that TC achieves better pinch-
off SNRs as compared to C. The simulation results are confirmed by the analysis of both
effective minimum distances and EXIT charts.

Coded MIMO Using Interblock
Memory
4.1 Introduction
Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) [43] systems with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive
antennas are attractive for their capability to provide spatial diversity to combat fading
and provide spatial multiplexing for achieving higher data rates. In [44][45][46], various
coded MIMO systems called turbo BLAST (Bell Labs Space-Time architecture) have been
proposed, which apply the turbo principle to the coded MIMO system by iteratively perform-
ing decoding and detecting between the channel decoder and the MIMO detector (BLAST
demapper). In [46], the channel code used is a turbo code and the resultant scheme is a
turbo coded MIMO scheme which is denoted by Γ0. It was shown in [46] that, in the fast
fading channel, the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curve [36] of the MIMO detector
is steep for the case of Nt > Nr. However, the EXIT curve of a turbo code is almost a
horizontal line and the code EXIT curve is, therefore, poorly matched to a steep detector
EXIT curve. Hence, the decoding thresholds (pinch-off limits) of Γ0 are distant from the
Shannon limits for the case of Nt > Nr [46].
In [47], the authors proposed to narrow this gap by serially concatenating a turbo code
with a space-time block code (STBC)[54][55]. The case of LDPC (low-density parity-check)
code optimized for a binary-input channel was investigated in [49]. It was demonstrated in
[49] that using STBC can transform a MIMO channel to a single-input single-output chan-
nel. In addition, this approach can flatten the demapper transfer curves if Gray mapping
is employed and hence the turbo (or LDPC) coded MIMO system can closely approach the
Shannon limit. However, the rate of STBC coded MIMO system is reduced since employing

= [bo, · · · , bK−1]T denote such a group, where each bˆi is a binary m-tuple, bk ∈ {0, 1}, and
T denotes the transpose. The output of the BLAST mapper is represented by the symbol
vector s¯ = [s0, · · · , sNt−1]T , where si is a constellation point labelled by bˆi and is transmitted
through the (i + 1)-th transmit antenna. The average energy of s¯ is limited to Es, and we
will use E[|si|2] = Es/Nt for i = 0, 1, · · · , Nt − 1.
4.2.2 Channel Model
In this paper, we consider the Rayleigh fading channel. Elements of the Nr × Nt channel
matrix H are independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian random variables
with zero mean and independent real and imaginary parts each having variance of 0.5. We
assume fast fading. Hence, the channel matricesH at different time instants are independent.
In addition, it is assumed that H is unknown to the transmitter and is known perfectly to
the receiver. Let n¯ be a Nr-tuple consisting of white Gaussian noise entries with covariance
matrix Q= E[n¯∗n¯] =N0INr , where n¯
∗ denotes the conjugate transpose of n¯ and INr is a
Nr ×Nr identity matrix. Let rj be the received signal of the (j + 1)-th receive antenna. We
have
r¯ = Hs¯+ n¯ (4.1)
where r¯ = [r0, · · · , rNr−1]T . In addition, the normalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Eb/N0
is defined as [48]

4.2.3 MIMO Detector: MAP-based BLAST Demapper
Let c¯i be the (K−1)-bit binary representation of i and b¯k− = [b0, · · · , bk−1, bk+1, · · · , bK−1]T .
For each code bit bk, k = 0, 1, · · · , K − 1, let LM,a(bk) = lnPr(bk=1)Pr(bk=0) be the a priori LLR and
L¯M,a(b¯k−) = [LM,a(b0), · · · , LM,a(bk−1), LM,a(bk+1), · · · , LM,a(bK−1)]T . (4.3)
From the channel model given in (4.1), we have the following conditional probability density
function
Pr(r¯ | H, s¯) = det(2piQ)−1/2e− 12 (r¯−Hs¯)∗Q−1(r¯−Hs¯). (4.4)
For a BLAST demapper using a MAP (maximum a posteriori) algorithm, the a posteriori
LLR for each code bit bk is given by
LM,p(bk | r¯) = LM,a(bk) + lny(1)
y(0)
(4.5)
where y(l) =
∑2K−1−1

)exp[c¯i · L¯M,a(b¯k−)], l = 0, 1, map(·)
denotes the BLAST mapping of the associated mNt-tuple, and (c¯i)a:b denotes the (b−a+1)-
tuple containing the a-th to the b-th components of c¯i.
43
(Nt, Nr) = (2, 1), where DB is an one-block-unit delay operator. The delay time of one-
block-unit delay equals the period of q MIMO transmissions. Each block can represent w
message bits. The rate w/N of the turbo code is 1/2. Like Γ0, Γ can transmit two message
bits per channel use. With the delay operator, the input to the BLAST mapper at the `-th
block is (v¯1,`, v¯2,`) = (u¯`−1, p¯`), where u¯` and p¯` represent the interleaved message bits and
the interleaved parity bits, respectively, of the `-th turbo codeword a¯`. Bits in v¯j,` are used
to label the Gray mapped QPSK signals transmitted through the j-th transmit antenna for
j = 1, 2.
4.3.2 Iterative Decoding within a Single Codeword (IDSC)
Iterative decoding within a single (turbo) codeword (IDSC) combined with either RID or
CID can be used to iteratively detect and decode Γ. Now we consider the detection-decoding
algorithms of (u¯`, p¯`) ≡ a¯` based on that LD,e(u¯`−1) has been obtained. First, we present
IDSC-RID.
Step 1 Through the BLAST demapper, we obtain the a posteriori LLR values, LM,p(p¯`)
computed by (4.5) with LM,a(u¯`−1) (or equivalently LD,e(u¯`−1)) which is the LLR ob-
tained in the decoding of the previous turbo codeword. Note that LM,a(u¯`−1) provides
a half of the a priori LLR values for the demapper. The other half of a priori LLR
values provided by LM,a(p¯`) is zero.
Step 2 By a way similar to Step 1, we obtain the a posteriori LLR values, LM,p(u¯`) computed
by (4.5) with LM,a(u¯`) = LM,a(p¯`+1) = 0¯, where 0¯ is the all zero DB-tuple.
Step 3 The turbo decoder uses LD,a(u¯`) (or equivalently LM,e(u¯`)) and LD,a(p¯`) (or equiv-
alently LM,e(p¯`)) as input to yield the a posteriori LLR output values, LD,p(u¯`) and
LD,p(p¯`), after NI iterations within the turbo decoder.
Step 4 The turbo decoder computes the LLR values LD,e(u¯`) = LD,p(u¯`)−LD,a(u¯`), which
are then interleaved to become the LLR values in LM,a(u¯`) that are stored for the
detection of the next block.
Step 5 Estimate u¯` through decision on LD,p(u¯`).
Now, consider IDSC-CID. Steps 1-3 in IDSC-CID are the same as those in IDSC-RID.
Step 4 to Step 7 of IDSC-CID are given in the following.
Step 4 The SISO turbo decoder computes the LLR values in LD,e(u¯`) = LD,p(u¯`)−LD,a(u¯`),
LD,e(p¯`) = LD,p(p¯`) − LD,a(p¯`) respectively which are then interleaved to become the
LLR values in LM,a(u¯`) and LM,a(p¯`) that are fed into the BLAST demapper.
45
the a posteriori LLR values from p¯`+1 by assuming Ia(p¯`+1) = x. In addition, LM,a(u¯`) and
LM,a(p¯`) provide little improvement in LM,e(u¯`) and LM,e(p¯`) since the Gray labelling is used
in the signal mapper. Hence, the detector EXIT curve is almost a horizontal line. In contrast
to Γ0, LM,a(u¯`) and LM,a(p¯`) can provide significant improvement in LM,e(u¯`) and LM,e(p¯`).
Obtaining reliable LM,a(u¯`) and LM,a(p¯`) requires iterative detection or CID. For Γ0, the
gain obtained by using CID is significant while, for Γ, the gain obtained by using CID is
limited. Also included in Fig. 4.2 is the EXIT curve of the turbo decoder with NI = 20,
where ID,a(a¯`) and ID,e(a¯`) denote the a priori and extrinsic mutual information of the
turbo decoder, respectively. We find that for Γ the flattened EXIT curve of the demapper
can match the close-to-horizontal EXIT curve of the turbo decoder. Hence, as compared
to Γ0, Γ can achieve a better pinch-off limit (threshold) which is obtained by assuming the
worst case that x = 0.
4.4.2 Improved Detection and Decoding Algorithms for Γ: IDAC-
RID and IDAC-CID
By observing the detector EXIT curves of Γ for the cases of x=0, 0.5, and 1 in Fig. 4.2,
we find that better detector EXIT curve can be obtained if more information about p¯`+1 is
obtained. We can cancel the interference between two transmit antennas and obtain reliable
LLR values LM,e(u¯`) and hence LD,a(u¯`) by iterative decoding between adjacent codewords
(IDAC). With IDAC, we can obtain improved Ia(p¯`+1). IDAC-RID based on that LD,e(u¯`−1)
has been obtained is described as follows.
Step 1 With LD,e(u¯`) = 0¯, we use IDSC-RID to decode (u¯`+1, p¯`+1) and obtain LD,e(p¯`+1).
Note that, in the demapper, the calculation of LM,p(p¯`+1) is based on LM,a(u¯`) =
LM,a(p¯`+1) = 0¯.
Step 2 With LD,e(p¯`+1) obtained in Step 1, LD,e(u¯`−1), and LM,a(u¯`)=LM,a(p¯`)=0¯, the
demapper calculates LM,p(u¯`) and LM,p(p¯`) by (4.5). The turbo decoder uses LM,e(u¯`)
(or equivalently LD,a(u¯`)) and LM,e(p¯`) (or equivalently LD,a(p¯`)) to decode (u¯`, p¯`)
and obtain LD,e(u¯`) and LD,e(p¯`).
Step 3 Use IDSC-RID to re-decode (u¯`+1, p¯`+1) and update LD,e(p¯`+1) with LD,e(u¯`) ob-
tained in Step 2.
Step 4 Repeat Step 2 with updated LD,e(p¯`+1) obtained in Step 3.
Step 5 After repeating Steps 3 and 4 for NIDAC−1 times, we can decode (u¯`, p¯`) and obtain
LD,e(u¯`).

N = 105 and CID can achieve a BER of 10−4 at Eb/No = 4.0 dB.
4.5 Concluding Remarks
The performance of conventional turbo coded MIMO scheme Γ0 and turbo coded MIMO
scheme with interblock memory Γ in the water-fall region is investigated. We show that Γ can
closely approach the Shannon capacity which can not be achieved by Γ0. We also propose an
improved detection-decoding algorithm for Γ to achieve the near-capacity performance. As
compared to irregular LDPC codes optimized for MIMO systems, Γ can achieve comparable
performance.

Conclusions
In this report, we first propose to provide correlation between codewords of a binary turbo
code C by introducing interblock memory. Binary codes, TC , can be constructed based
on various degrees of interblock memory. Two suboptimum decoding methods for TC have
been proposed. One is designed based on iterative decoding within a single binary turbo
codeword, called IDSC. The other is designed based on iterative decoding between two
adjacent binary turbo codewords, called IDAC. As compared to IDSC, IDAC usually provides
better BER performance with the cost of higher decoding complexity. The cases of using the
conventional binary turbo code and using multiple turbo code as C have been respectively
studied. Simulation for various code lengths and various interleavers shows the advantage of
TC over C in the BER performance. Simulation results are verified by the analysis of effective
minimum distances and EXIT charts for the case of TC using the conventional binary turbo
code as C. For coded modulation, similar advantage can be obtained.
The performance of conventional turbo coded MIMO scheme Γ0 and turbo coded MIMO
scheme with interblock memory Γ in the water-fall region is investigated. We show that Γ can
closely approach the Shannon capacity which can not be achieved by Γ0. We also propose an
improved detection-decoding algorithm for Γ to achieve the near-capacity performance. As
compared to irregular LDPC codes optimized for MIMO systems, Γ can achieve comparable
performance.

IEEE 通訊學會 (Communication Society, COMSOC)，是 IEEE各學會中規模

COMSOC直接督導的學術性會議也就是最重要的學術性會議只有兩個。一是每

會議有個人室內及行動通訊會議(International Symposium on Personal Indoor and 
Mobile Communications, PIMRC)以及無線通訊及網路(Wireless Communications

王晉良教授擔任出版委員會主席，清大電機系趙啟超教授擔任 tutorial委員會主

通訊以及行動通訊占通訊產業之比重大增因此 PIMRC以及WCNC兩會議也就
受到日益增加的重視。今年 PIMRC2007於九月三日至九月七日於希臘雅典希爾
頓飯店舉行。希臘古文明遺蹟以及愛琴海蔚藍之海水聞名於世，加上無線通訊以
及行動通訊學術研究目前有一日千里之發展趨勢，因此本屆大會吸引了超過一千
名與會者報名參加。規模非常盛大。 
九月初雖然不算是希臘觀光旺季，然而我稍微遲了些時日去訂機票就拿不到
一般機位，只有遠高於國科會允許票價額度之機位。擔心了許久，才於出發前不

機位才是。於出發往希臘之前，新聞報導希臘氣溫高達攝氏四十度，繼而發生延
燒多日難以控制之森林大火。甚至有報導說火勢漫延至雅典郊區。在 PIMRC2007
之網頁中特別強調火勢不至於影響到雅典不會影響到會議之進行。然而仍是心裏
有些不安。搭機前猜想也許有許多人會因報導之大火而放棄去希臘之機會，所以
機倉可能會有許多空位。事實上是機倉仍然爆滿，可見雅典之魅力。 
九月二日搭機啟程，途中於曼谷機場短暫之停留，總計經過十多小時漫長之

在 Keynote Speeches方面大會處理的比較不好，在短時間安排了太多的演講

Technical Sessions方面，因為發表論文篇數太多，所以在同一時段有十二個同

會節目手冊不符。而 PIMRC2007 之 session chair都直接跳到下一位報告講員。
如此一來，由其他 session趕來聽論文報告的人，常發現想聽的論文已經在預定
時段之前先行報告完畢，造成一些混亂。此外每一篇論文只有十二分鐘講演時

這一次我的學生蔡勇志在九月四日發表一篇名為 PAPR Reduction for OFDM 
Systems by Deliberate Power Boost之論文內容包括有 OFDM信號之變換對降低
PAPR之影響以及變換之最佳化以及與一種新型的採用 tail biting的 turbo

間之內報告完畢。幸好蔡勇志同學在出國前演練多次因而在 PIMRC報告時非
常順利。我本人於九月六日發表一篇名為 Iterative Detection and Decoding or the 
Near-Capacity Performance of Turbo Coded MIMO Schemes之論文。文中我們對
先前設計之具區塊間記憶的 Turbo Coded MIMO設計出一種高效能解調與解碼
方式並推導出在極長碼長時的極限效能。此極限效能遠優於傳統 Turbo Coded 
MIMO之極限效能。我們自認此論文是一篇成果極為優秀且吸引人之論文。可
惜大會將此論文放在主題為WIMAX之 session。在論文報告完畢後沒有人發

PIMRC2007大會對相關的社交活動頗費心思。九月三日晚在希爾頓飯店的
