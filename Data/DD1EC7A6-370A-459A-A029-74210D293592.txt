Abstract 
The third year project is focused at the design of high efficiency and high power density 
bidirectional power converters. The proposed multi-phase implementation in the quasi resonant (QR) 
zero current switching (ZCS) switched capacitor (SC) bidirectional DC-DC converter structure helps 
to reduce current ripple, switching loss and significantly increase the converter efficiency and power 
density. This approach provides a more precise output voltage to obtain voltage conversion ratios 
from the double-mode versus half-mode to n-mode versus 1/n mode. This is accomplished by adding 
a different number of switched-capacitors and power MOSFET switches with a small series connected 
resonant inductor for forward and reverse schemes. The size and cost can be reduced when the 
proposed converter has coupled inductance. This report presents the simulation and experimental 
results for two-phase and four-phase with and without coupled inductance interleaved QR ZCS SC 
converters for bidirectional charger application, and an extending structure for N-phases is mentioned.  
 
Keywords：multiple phase converter, QR ZCS soft switching, coupled inductor, bidirectional battery 
charger 
 
I. Introduction 
 The switched-capacitor DC/DC converter is a 
non-magnetic converter that requires only 
capacitors and power semiconductor switches in 
the power stage. This structure presents light 
weight, smaller size and possible fabrication on a 
semiconductor integrated circuit chip. However, 
the larger switching loss and current stress are 
essential defects in the conventional high 
frequency switching DC/DC converter [1-3]. 
Quasi-resonant converters that are able to operate 
at constant switching frequency with zero-current 
or zero-voltage switching (ZCS or ZVS) have 
been used to reduce the switching loss in the 
converter to overcome these problems. A 
zero-current switching switched-capacitor 
quasi-resonant (ZCS SC QR) converter that can 
operate at high switching frequency with less 
switching loss for increased converter efficiency 
with fewer switches has been proposed in the 
literature[1, 3]. Although the ZCS SC QR 
converter has numerous advantages, its power 
flow control is only unidirectional. 
Bidirectional DC/DC power conversion has 
received great interest in systems fed by DC 
power including electric vehicles, hybrid energy 
systems, fuel-cell systems and PV generation 
systems with energy storage units [4, 5]. The 
bidirectionality in these applications involves 
current flow while the polarity of the dc voltage 
at either end remains unchanged. Applications in 
battery equalization schemes where the stronger 
energy of this system is transferred into the 
weaker energy subsystem using a bidirectional 
power flow control scheme [6]. A class of soft 
switching bidirectional DC/DC converters is the 
expected candidate for applications such as 
uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), battery 
charging and discharging systems, auxiliary 
power supplies in HEV, dual voltage automotive 
systems, PV generation and micro grid power 
systems [5-6]. A switched capacitor based 
bidirectional DC/DC converter providing 
step-down/step-up voltage capability was 
proposed in [7-8]. Input/output current pulsating 
peak countermeasures in the bidirectional SC 
converter were suggested but the switching losses

According to stages 1 ~ 4, the resonant 
angular frequencies are both the same, so we can 
obtain a duty rate of QP1, QP1’,  QN1 and QN1’ for 
zero current switching conditions as ΛP1TS ≧ 
π/ωr and  ΛN1TS ≧ π/ωr, where ΛP1 and ΛN1 
are the QP1, QP1’,  QN1 and QN1’ duty ratios, TS is 
the switching duty of the proposed bidirectional 
converter. It is serviceable to use a multi-phase 
scheme to increase the output current and output 
power, however it requires an inductor in every 
single phase, causing higher cost, larger volume 
and heavier weight. Using the coupled inductor 
method may be an easy solution and benefit for 
reducing the size, volume and inductor cost.

The equivalent inductance and capacitance 
are shown in the forward scheme QR ZCS SC 
converter. The reverse scheme can be proved 
likewise. Extending to four-phase, the function 
we obtained in (23) and (24) is still applicable. 
Figures 4 (a) and (b) show the four-phase 
topology with two coupled inductor for both 
forward and reverse schemes. In the four-phase 
converter, every phase shifts 45 degrees from the 
other, phase-one and phase-three coupling as 
two-phase structure, and phase-two and 
phase-four as well. 
IV. Simulation Results 
The proposed two-phase zero current 
switching switched capacitor bidirectional 3 to 
1/3 DC-DC converter has shown in fig. 5. 
Multi-phase interleaving optimize the conversion 
efficiency and higher output power is achieved, 
although it takes more components which means 
higher cost.

two-phase QR ZCS S-C converters.  Figures 7 
(a) and (b) show the triple-mode efficiency 
comparing one and two phases in both directions, 
respectively. The highest efficiency of the two- 
phase converter in triple-mode is about 99.2% 
when the output power is 100 W. This is much 
higher than 96% for the single phase converter 
and the highest efficiency of the two-phase 
converter in trisection-mode is about 96.8% 
when the output power is 200 W. This is also 
higher than 88.3% for the single phase converter 
when the output power is 100 W. The average 
output voltage for the triple mode/trisection mode 
is 140.26 V / 46.26 V, higher than 134.43 V / 
41.77 V in the single phase structure. By 
comparing the single phase and two-phase, we 
have found that the efficiency has improved 
significantly and the output voltage is much more 
fixed, also providing higher output power 
capability. An extending four-phase zero current

VI. Conclusions 
 
A QR ZCS bidirectional DC-DC converter 
with multi-phase, coupling inductor interleaving 
was presented for reducing the output ripple and 
filter size, increasing the power density. 
According to the simulation and experimental 
results, the proposed triple mode/trisection mode 
converter was constructed and verified. Although 
this design requires more components, the 
efficiency and power density increase in the 
converter which can be easily extended to n / 
1
n
 mode. From the tradeoff point of view, the 
proposed approach is still very useful for 
industrial applications such as bidirectional 
battery charger.

and a modularized design approach for the battery 
equalization scheme. The disadvantage of the 
conventional equalization scheme is that the hard 
switching of the bi-directional dc-to-dc converter will 
cause a significant switching loss, and the EMI 
emissions of the battery charging system [9-12]. A 
simple soft switching technology based on the quasi 
resonant converter theory can be used to mitigate the 
drawback for reducing the switching loss and EMI 
emission of the battery equalizers [13-16]. 
Figure 2 shows the proposed QR ZCS bidirectional 
battery equalizer that is modified from QR buck-boost 
bidirectional converter with the small number of passive 
inductance element under the same QR ZCS equivalent 
topology. The direction of the energy transfer between 
the two adjacent cells is determined according to the cell 
voltage difference or the battery residual capacity in the 
battery strings and the controlled by the power MOSFET 
switches. If VB1>VB2, Q1 is turned on, and the inductor L
stores energy from VB1 during the DTS period. During 
the other (1-D)TS period, Q1 is turned off, and the body 
diode D2 is forced to turn on, the stored energy in L is
discharged to VB2 to act as a controlled constant current 
source of cell balance according to the energy 
transferring direction. The Lr and Cr are constructed as 
the resonant tank to achieve the zero current switching 
function for the symmetrical and bi-directional battery 
equalizer. 
III.  ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED EQUALIZER
The equivalent circuit in Fig. 2 for the proposed 
battery equalization scheme is shown in Fig. 3 (a) and 
(b) under the different cell voltages, VB1 > VB2 and VB1 <
VB2, respectively. The corresponding typical waveforms 
of the proposed QR ZCS battery equalizer are also 
shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b). The detailed equivalent 
circuits of the proposed battery equalization scheme are 
shown in Fig. 4(a) - 4(e) during the various time 
intervals for VB1 > VB2. The soft switching performance 
and the detailed circuit analysis of the bidirectional 
converter are demonstrated as follows.

IV.  SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To verify the analysis results discussed above, a 
simulation was performed for a two-modular lead-acid 
battery stack with a proposed QR ZCS equalization 
schemes. Figure 5 shows the control block diagram of the 
medical power operated vehicle with the proposed QR 
ZCS battery charge equalizer. The PIC16F690 micro-
controlled unit (MCU) was adopted as the battery 
equalization controlled chip with the charger in this 
experimental platform shown as Fig. 5. The series 
connected lead-acid battery strings were used in the 
battery charging experiment. The battery type is Kung 
Long Batteries, 8Ah. The battery initial voltages are 
shown as following: VB1=12.8 (V) and VB2=11.6 (V).
Fig.6. shows the controlled flow chart of the proposed 
charge equalization scheme of the medical power 
operated vehicle. The battery pack charging profile is 
recommended as follows: Constant current mode 
charging ĺUntil pack voltage is 29.7 (V)ĺConstant 
voltage mode charging (I), pack voltage is 29.7 (V)ĺA
specified duration (about 30 minute)ĺ Constant voltage 
mode charging (II), pack voltage is 27.5 (V)ĺUntil end 
of charging state for the duration, shown as Fig. 10 (b). 
For simplicity, the battery storage elements were 
assumed to be capacitors with an equivalent series 
resistor (ESR). The initial battery voltages in the 
simulations were set at VB1=12.8(V) and VB2=11.6(V). 
The circuit parameters were L=270µH, Lr=59.9µH and 
Cr=1.66µF. The switching frequency for the equalization 
scheme was 16.67 kHz, and the duty was selected as 
D=0.5 for both VB1 > VB2 under the proposed bi-
directional dc-to-dc converter operating at the zero 
current switching mode that can provide a lower 
switching loss to improve the efficiency of the cell 
voltage balancing scheme. 
Figures 7 (a), and (c) show the simulation results of 
the proposed battery equalizer under VB1>VB2. Figure 7 
(a) shows the simulated main switching currents of 
MOSFET Q1 ids and the corresponding triggered voltages 
vgs, Figure 7(c) shows the resonant capacitor voltage vcr
and the corresponding triggered voltages vgs, respectively. 
Figs. 10 (a) and 10(b) show the cell voltage trajectories 
during cell voltage equalization under VB1>VB2 and
VB1<VB2. It can clearly observe that the resonant inductor 
current iLr is a sinusoidal waveform and more than a half 
cycle from zero over the peak value then returned to zero. 
The main switching current is turned on at near zero 
current and turned off at zero current state that can 
validate the converter operating in QR ZCS for reducing 
the switching loss of MOSFETs. Observation from Fig. 
10, after balancing all the cell voltages within the limit, 
the BMS will send an execution command to cut-off the 
MOSFETs, and to stop the cell voltage balancing process 
of the battery equalizers, therefore, the cell voltages are 
stopped at the same end-of-charge state of the battery 
string. 
To validate the proposed equalization scheme, a two-
modular battery stack with a proposed modular 
equalization schemes was installed in the battery strings 
for the experiment to verify the performance of the QR 
ZCS battery equalization scheme. The driving signals for 
the two equalization schemes were controlled by using a 
MCU based battery management system according to the 
sensed cell voltages. The driving signals were 
constructed using a logical switching algorithm that is 
generated from the BMS, and instructed by a micro-
control chip unit. The battery stacks were two 8 Ah lead-
acid batteries with the same initial voltages and circuit

Abstract-- This paper proposes a zero-current-switching 
(ZCS) quasi-resonant (QR) bidirectional converter with 
secondary output power amplifier. For implantable 
biomedical devices applications, the proposed device could 
be regarded as a power regulator with power amplifier. The 
bidirectional converter could provide voltage conversion 
ratio double-mode/half-mode and also be employed as a 
secondary output power amplifier. The forward and reverse 
power conversion modes and power amplifier operating 
principles are described. Simulations and experiments are 
carried out to verify the concept and performance for the 
bidirectional power conversions and secondary output 
power amplifier. This device can be applied to wireless 
energy transfer for a battery management system (BMS) in 
an implantable electronics system.

I.  INTRODUCTION
Wireless power transmission has been widely 
researched and implemented in biomedical devices in 
recent years. Commonly implantable biomedical devices 
require power supplied by a battery system. To date, the 
intrathecal drug delivery helps lessen the intractable pain 
of chronic sufferers, consisting of the programmable 
pump and small catheter, effectively gives the medication 
to spinal cord directly. Similarly, the rechargeable spinal 
cord stimulator for the patient who has the chronic pain 
and it helps relieve the symptoms. Besides, a pacemaker 
that helps maintain the heart beat regularly for the person 
has an arrhythmia. The above biomedical devices are 
battery-powered and surgically implanted. The battery 
capacity limits the device operating time and performance. 
As the battery power becomes low, surgery to replace the 
unit with a new one causes additional lesions to a patient. 
It is worthwhile to develop a means to recharge the 
battery in vivo. The electromagnetic waveform 
technology used to transmit the biomedical information 
has been investigated in numerous literature [1-2]. For 
instance, Class-E amplifiers that have the high efficiency 
and simple circuits have been adapted to this technology. 
Variable types of Class-E amplifiers have also been 
proposed [3-6]. A low power integrated circuit 
lithium-ion battery management system for rechargeable 
wireless transfer implantable electronics system is 
proposed in [7]. Some resonant switched-capacitor 
converters are developed for high efficiency power 
conversion and voltage balancing control for series 
connected capacitors and batteries [8-11]. For the electric 
vehicle (EV) charging system, safety problems deserve to 
be concerned as the battery of the EV is charged. 
Electrical shocks may occur due to charging in the dusty 
and wet environment. Study on the wireless power 
transmission and transmitting materials for the EV is 
proposed [12-14]. 
A new topology using the resonant switched-capacitor 
technology is proposed in this paper. The converter is 
designed in the zero-current switching condition to 
reduce the switching losses. A secondary output voltage 
exists across the RLoad that can be employed as a class E 
power amplifier to transfer the energy power from the 
transceiver coil to the receiver coil for the BMS in the 
implantable biomedical systems.  
II.  SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
A scheme that includes transmitting parts, receiving 
parts and a battery management system for an intrathecal 
drug delivery of wireless power transmission system is 
shown in Fig. 1. The transmitting part is composed of a 
ZCS QR bidirectional converter with a secondary output 
power amplifier. The proposed converter can transfer 
energy from the main source (V1) to the energy storage 
unit (V2) under bidirectional power flow control, and also 
be used as a class E power amplifier output from the 
specified arrangement in the series resonant tank circuit. 
A zero-current switching quasi-resonant bidirectional 
converter circuit with secondary output power amplifier 
is illustrated in Fig. 2. The two power amplifier outputs 
could be selected. Scheme 1 involves transmitting power 
through the coil coupling shown in Fig. 2 (b). Scheme 2 
involves antennas connected to the major resonant 
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Zero-current switching 
quasi-resonant bidirectional converter with a secondary 
output power amplifier is designed in this scheme. The 
advantages are that the transmitting coil could be 
integrated into the circuit to provide a secondary output 
for wireless power transmission as a power amplifier. 
This configuration consists of major MOSFETs with 
integrated Schottky diodes, transmitting coil (Ltc), 
receiving coil (Lrc), pi-type filter and load impedance 
(RLoad). The transmitting and receiving coil could be 
seen as inductors hence the resonant tank circuit is

Stage 4 (Fig. 3 (d); t3  t < t4): During this interval, 
the inductor current will stay in zero current state. After a 
specified time, Q1N is tuned off at zero current state 
where t = t4. 
According to stages 1 ~ 4, the resonant angular 
frequencies are both the same, so we can obtain the Q1P 
and Q1N duty rate for the zero current switching 
condition as ӳ 1PTS Њ Ӹ /Ȧ and ӳ 1NTS Њ Ӹ /Ȧ,
where ӳ1P and ӳ1N are the duty ratios of Q1P and Q1N, 
TS is the switching duty of the proposed bidirectional 
converter. 
Figures 4 (a)-4 (d) show the alternating equivalent 
circuits for the proposed bidirectional converter with 
secondary output power amplifier under the reverse 
power flow control scheme. The analytical procedure is 
similar to that for the bidirectional converter with 
secondary output power amplifier in the forward power 
flow control and is omitted in this paper. The pi-filter of 
the receiving part is neglected and the resonant circuit in 
the converter of Fig. 5(a) would then be a second-order 
low-pass filter. Figure 5(b) shows the equivalent circuit 
for the bidirectional converter with the secondary output 
power amplifier shown in Fig. 2(b). The transfer function 
of output voltage with respect to input voltage Figs. 5(a) 
and 5(b) can be expressed as:

From the circuit analysis and simulation results, the 
proposed scheme for implementing zero-current 
switching quasi-resonant bidirectional converter with 
secondary output power amplifier is feasible. The 
converters were developed and realized acceptable power 
conversion and battery management. This device could 
operate at high efficiency with low EMI emission and 
low current stress features. By integrating battery 
management system technology, the additional power 
amplifier extends the application of these converters into 
the implantable biomedical device field. Detailed 
experimental procedures have carried out to verify the 
performance of the proposed ZCS SC QR bidirectional 
converter with secondary output power amplifier in the 
studies.
