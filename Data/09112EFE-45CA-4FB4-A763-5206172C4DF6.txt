Abstract 
 The structures of most existing 6-DOF 
parallel manipulators are very similar, which 
leads to similarities in many kinematic 
properties. This paper presents three novel 
designs with different shapes or structures. The 
global isotropy, orientation workspace and 
reachable workspace of the proposed designs 
are then evaluated and compared with those of 
traditional manipulators. The results show the 
proposed designs have much better global 
isotropy and larger singularity-free orientation 
and reachable workspaces. 
 
Keywords: parallel manipulators; isotropy; 
singularity; workspace; orientation. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 Parallel manipulators have been employed in 
many industrial applications (including motion 
simulators, industrial robots, force/torque 
sensors, micromanipulators, wire robots, wrists, 
etc). A parallel manipulator consists of a 
moving platform, a fixed base, and several 
connecting chains. Parallel manipulators have 
high accuracy, high force/torque capacity, and 
high structural rigidity, but their workspace is 
significantly smaller then that of serial 
manipulators. Therefore, dexterity and 
workspace are two of the most important 
criteria in the design of parallel manipulators. 
In the past three decades, 2-DOF or 3-DOF 
parallel designs with optimum reachable 
workspace, orientation workspace, or/and 
isotropy have been proposed [1-5]. Recently, 
much attention has been paid to the design of 
3-DOF parallel manipulators with a rotational 
or translational moving platform [6-10]. For 
6-DOF parallel manipulators, some researchers 
have proposed methods to design parallel 
manipulators with optimum dexterity [11-15]. 
The literature on optimum reachable 
workspaces or orientation workspaces, on the 
other hand, is very scarce. The platform and 
base of 6-DOF parallel manipulators are 
generally represented by two planes with six 
spherical joints placed around a circle on each 
plane, so the characteristics of existing 6-DOF 
parallel manipulators are very similar. These 
special geometric constraints prevent us from 
obtaining manipulators with better kinematic 
properties.  
 Three novel isotropic designs are presented in 
this work. The base of the first design is 
represented by two fixed parallel planes, with 
the platform placed between the two planes. 
The second and third designs are in the shape 
of a cube and a tetrahedron, respectively. Next, 
we adjust the parameters of these designs to 
obtain manipulators with equal size. The 
actuator ranges are then determined to keep the 
manipulators away from singularities, passive 
joint limits, and link interactions. Therefore, the 
or ientat ion and reachable workspaces 
developed from the obtained actuator ranges 
are singularity-free (and link-interaction- free) 
workspaces .  The global  i sot ropy and 
workspaces of these manipulators and two

region enclosed by the links, platform, and base. 
For each manipulator, we then search for the 
intervals of link lengths so the manipulator can 
avoid link interactions and singularities. 
 The volume of the first, fourth and fifth 
designs can be approximated by volume of a 
frustum of a right circular cone:  
 
        ( )2 21 1 2 2R +R R +R hV=
3
π
         (1) 
 
where h denotes the height, and R1 and R2 
represent the radius of the upper circle and the 
lower circle respectively. For the first new 
design, we provide the size of the generator and 
then determine the corresponding radius R2 
(= ib for i = 1, 2,…, 6) of the circle on the x-y 
plane. Next, we obtain the radius R1 of the two 
smaller circles on the two fixed planes. In this 
case, the volume of the design can be computed 
by  
 
   ( )2 21 1 2 21 2 R +R R +R dV = 3
π
        (2) 
 
With the obtained volume, we can easily 
determine the length of a side of a cube or a 
tetrahedron for generating the same volume. 
For the fourth and fifth designs, we use the 
same ratios of 11 R= hκ  and 22 R= hκ  as those 
of the two existing designs. Substituting 
1 1R = hκ  and 2 2R hκ=  into Eq. (1) and letting 
1V  = V yield

 After solving for h, then R1 and R2 can be 
obtained by back substitutions. The coordinates 
of Ai and Bi of the five presented designs that 
have the same volume are provided in Table 1. 
Next, we determine the actuator ranges that 
will allow the manipulators to avoid 
singularities and link interactions. 
 In this paper, the actuator ranges are 
determined using a grid-scanning approach. We 
solve the forward kinematics by a numerical 
method in which the six parameters that specify 
the position and orientation of the platform 
corresponding to a point in joint space are used 
as the initial values to develop the new 
parameters of its neighboring points. The 
Jacobian matrix of the numerical method is 
used to detect singularities. There are two types 
of singularities for parallel manipulators. A 
manipulator will lose one or more degrees of 
freedom at an inverse kinematic singular 
configuration. On the other hand, the moving 
platform gains one or more degrees of freedom, 
or the manipulator can not resist forces or 
moments in some directions at a direct 
kinematic singular configuration [19]. The 
determinant of the Jacobian is zero at any 
singular configuration. Thus, we can use the 
determinant of the Jacobian to detect 
singularities. It is very difficult for the solutions 
to converge if a manipulator is close to a 
singular configuration or poor initial values are 
given. If the solution does not converge after a 
certain number of iterations, then we compute 
the determinant of the Jacobian. A singular 
configuration is reached if the determinant is 
less than a specified value. Otherwise, we 
provide different sets of initial values until the 
solution converges. The wrench acting on the 
platform can be related to the vector of actuator 
forces τ  by 
 
⎡ ⎤⎡ ⎤ = ≡⎢ ⎥⎢ ⎥ × × ×⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦

where F and C denote, respectively, the 
resultant force and couple acting on the 
platform, and ir  is the position vector from the 
origin of coordinate frame B to the attachment 
point Ai on the base. A direct kinematic 
singular configuration is reached if matrix H is 
singular. 
 The constraint equations related to actuators 
strokes, passive joint limits, and link 
interferences can be found in the literature 
[20-22], and so are not presented in this paper 
due to limited space. For the new proposed 
manipulators, the platform is surrounded by the 
six links, so we need to detect whether the 
payload on the platform interferes with the 
manipulator. In this paper, we assume that the 
payload can be placed in a sphere with 
radius pR . In this case, interferences occur 
when the minimum distance between the center 
 5
 This demonstrates that the limited positions 
of the traditional designs are generated by 
direct kinematic singularities, while the new 
proposed designs are generated by passive joint 
limits or link interferences. The ranges of the 
traditional designs are very small, which 
indicates that a traditional manipulator (even 
for an isotropic design) can easily reach a direct 
kinematic singular configuration. For the three 
new designs, there are some ways to increase 
the maximum allowable angle for spherical 
joints, for example, a spherical joint can be 
replaced by three revolute joints intersecting at 
one point. Therefore, except for the first design, 
whose actuator ranges are also generated by 
link interferences, or for a relatively large 
payload, the actuator ranges of the two 
remaining designs can be significantly 
improved.  
  
4. Isotropy and singular values 
 
 The isotropy measure previously proposed 
[15] is used for evaluating the closeness to an 
isotropy state. Let 3oσ and 1oσ  denote the 
smallest and largest singular values of the 
submatrix Ho consisting of the last three rows 
of matrix H defined in Eq. (4), and 3Pσ and 1Pσ  
represent the smallest and largest singular 
values, respectively, of the submatrix PH  
consisting of the first three rows of H. Then the 
isotropy measure can be expressed as

where 3σ and 1σ  denote the smallest and 
largest singular values of ,tP oH H   and 
oH and PH  are two matrices (with orthonormal 
row vectors) that span the same row spaces of 
oH and PH  respectively. The global isotropy is 
compared by the mean value and the worst 
value of μ , denoted by aveμ and minμ  
respectively, at the same number of sample 
points that are equally distributed within the 
intersection of actuator ranges given in Table 2. 
However, the range of intersection is too small 
to reflect the global isotropy of the presented 
designs. Therefore, we use the range of 
intersection of the three new designs to 
compare the global isotropy. At an isotropic 
configuration, 3 1 ,o o oσ σ σ= =  3 1P P Pσ σ σ= = , and 
1Φ = . For all the proposed isotropic designs, 
1μ =  at the isotropic configuration, but the 
singular values are different. Let oτ and Pτ  
denote the projection vectors of τ  onto the 
row spaces of oH and PH  respectively, and 
oq and Pq  denote the projection vectors of q  
(the vector of actuator joint rates) onto the row 
spaces of the Jacobian related to the angular 
velocity ω  of the platform and the linear 
velocity v of the reference point on the 
platform respectively. Then singular value oσ  
can be used to evaluate 
o
C
τ  and 
oq
ω
 , 
and Pσ  can be used to evaluate 
P
F
τ  and 
Pq
v
 . The values for aveμ , minμ , Pσ  and oσ  
of the presented manipulators are given in 
Table 3. One drawback for the isotropy 
measure is that 0μ ≠  at some singular 
configurations. Therefore, the aveμ and minμ  of 
the two existing designs should be significantly 
less than the given values if singularities are to 
be considered (for example, if we define 0μ =  
at a singular configuration). The actuator 
ranges in Table 2 are closely related to singular 
values Pσ and oσ . Larger joint displacements are 
needed to generate the same amount of linear 
and rotational displacements for larger Pσ and oσ , 
respectively. All the presented isotropic designs 
have the same value of Pσ , so the designs with 
larger oσ  have better actuator ranges. 
 
5. Singularity-free orientation and reachable 
workspaces 
 
 Without considering passive joint limits, link 
interactions and singularities, the boundary of 
the orientation workspace can be developed 
using the equations for kinematic analysis: 
 
 ( , , , , , ) for 1, 2, ,6i if x y z iα β γ ρ= = …   (6)

much smaller than those of the three new 
proposed designs. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
 Traditional 6-DOF manipulators consist of 
two planes representing the mobile platform 
and the base, and six connecting links that are 
placed between the two planes. Those 
manipulators have been studied by many 
researchers, and it has been shown that 
symmetric manipulators have better dexterity. 
The existing optimum design, however, is only 
partially symmetric because of the geometric 
constraint. This paper presented three fully 
symmetric designs and showed that they have 
significantly better global isotropy and larger 
singularity-free orientation and reachable 
workspaces. Traditional designs can easily 
approach kinematic singularities. This 
drawback limits their applications to some 
particular tasks that do not require dexterity or 
accuracy. The new presented designs, on the 
other hand, are suitable for the high-precision 
devices such as sensors or industrial robots. In 
general, fully symmetric parallel manipulators 
are quite promising and worth further 
investigations.

 Abstract—A 6-DOF parallel manipulator 
with three PPSR chains is commonly used as a 
minimanipulator that requires accuracy and 
dexterity. The desired properties can be 
significantly improved if the manipulator is 
close to an isotropic configuration. This paper 
presents methods for developing 6-DOF 
isotropic parallel manipulators with three PPSR 
or PRPS chains. Many isotropic designs can be 
directly obtained from isotropy generators that 
consist of six straight lines satisfying the 
isotropy conditions. Some almost isotropic 
designs with desired link parameters are also 
developed using isotropy generators and/or 
optimization methods. 
 
 Keywords: isotropy, parallel manipulator, 
PPSR, PRPS 
 
I . Introduction 
 
 6-DOF Steward-Gough parallel manipulators 
have been studied by many researchers and have 
been employed in various applications. The 
manipulators possess high accuracy, rigidity, 
capacity, and load-to-weight ratio, but their 
workspaces are smaller than those of serial 
manipulators. A larger workspace can be 
expected if a parallel manipulator comprises 
fewer limbs that are driven by two or more 
actuators. Kohli et al. [1] presented 
manipulators with three kinematic chains and 
each chain is driven by a 2-DOF base-mounted 
rotary-linear actuator. Tsai and Tahmasebi [2] 
introduced a new class of 6-DOF parallel 
minimanipulators for providing high resolution 
and high stiffness for fine position and force 
control in a hybrid serial-parallel manipulator 
system. Majid et al [3] analyzed the workspace 
of a 6-DOF parallel manipulator with three 
PPSR chains and showed that its workspace is 
larger than that of a Stewart platform. For the 
design with three PPSR chains, only a fraction 
of an actuator joint rate/force is employed to 
generate the twist/wrench of the mobile 
platform, so they provide high resolution for 
fine position and force control. However, high 
resolution also indicates that a manipulator 
might be close to an inverse kinematic 
configuration where computation errors are 
generally very large in instantaneous and 
kinetostatic analysis. An isotropic design can 
get around this drawback because we can expect 
better computation accuracy, and a manipulator 
can be controlled equally well in all possible 
directions at an isotropic configuration. 
 This paper proposes methods for developing 
isotropic designs with three PPSR or PRPS 
chains driven by six linear actuators. Two 
special isotropy generators whose six straight 
lines intersect at three different points are first 
proposed. The generators and some additional 
isotropy conditions are then utilized to 
determine the directions of all prismatic axes. 
Many isotropic designs can be easily developed 
using the generators and the related data of the 
prismatic axes. Furthermore, we present two 
almost isotropic designs with desired link 
parameters. The design with PRPS chains is 
developed from an isotropic manipulator and 
then modified using an optimization method. 
The first two joints of the design constitute a 
cylindrical pair with the axis in a horizontal 
plane, and the third prismatic axis is 
perpendicular to the cylindrical axis. Because 
the designs with 3-PPSR chains are commonly 
used as minimanipulators, the other almost 
isotropic design with PPSR chains is developed 
using a general optimization method in which 
one of the parameters can be employed to 
determine the resolution (in position or force 
control) of the obtained manipulators.  
II. Isotropy generators and isotropy 
conditions 
 
 A 6-DOF isotropic Steward-Gough parallel 
manipulator can be easily obtained by placing 
the tool center point at the origin of the reference 
frame of an isotropy generator, and the two 
spherical joints (of each chain) on the 
corresponding straight line of the isotropy 
generator [4]. This approach, however, cannot 
be directly employed to develop the 
manipulators with only three kinematic chains. 
This section proposes isotropy generators and 
isotropy conditions for developing 6-DOF 
isotropic manipulators with three PRPS or 
PPSR chains. 
 6-DOF manipulators with three PRPS or PPSR

plane, so we can expect a higher payload 
capacity. 
 2. 0=2k-1 2ku ui  for k = 1, 2, 3. In this case, 
three pairs of perpendicular prismatic axes 
can be obtained. 
A manipulator is close to an inverse kinematic 
singular configuration (where a manipulator 
will lose one or more degrees of freedom) if any 
inner product i ie ui  approaches zero. Therefore, 
a larger singularity-free workspace can be 
obtained for a larger i ie ui  for i = 1, 2,…, 6. 
The isotropic design with the optimum inner 
product of ie  and iu  can be obtained by letting 
c 1= = =2j-1 2j-1 2j 2je u e ui i  and solving Eq. (2). If no 
real solution is obtained, then repeat reducing c 
and solving the equation until the equation 
yields real solutions. The obtained solutions for 
the desired link parameters are given in Table 2, 
where z = [ ]0 0 1 t  represents the direction of 
the z-axis, ×= ×
2k-1 2k
k
2k-1 2k
u uw
u u
 denotes the normal 
vector of the plane spanned by the two prismatic 
axes on the thk  chain. A manipulator has better 
resolution in position or force control with a 
smaller i ie ui , but the manipulator is also 
relatively close to inverse kinematic 
singularities. In general, we prefer a 3-PRPS 
manipulator with 2k-1z ui = 0 and 0=2k -1 2ku ui , 
and a 3-PPSR manipulator with 1=kz wi  and 
0=2k-1 2ku ui . 
 How to develop a 3-PRPS isotropic design 
with optimum i ie ui  from the fifth solution in 
Table 2 is illustrated in Fig. 3, where 1u  and 2u  
are in a plane spanned by 1e  and 2e  with 
cos30= = °1 1 2 2e u e ui i . First, draw a straight line 
2M  through point 1A  and in the opposite 
direction of 2u . Next, obtain an arbitrary point 
1Q  on the straight line and draw another straight 
line 1M  through point 1Q  and in the direction 
of 1u . Straight line 1M  is used as the first 
prismatic axis and the second revolute axis (the 
two joints constitute a 2-DOF cylindrical joint), 
and 2M  is used as the third prismatic axis. 
Figure 4 shows a 3-PPSR isotropic design 
developed from the same solution. Points 1Q  
and 2Q  are on the two straight lines, 1L  and 
2L , through point 1A  and in the direction of 1e  
and 2e  respectively. The straight line L’ 
through 1Q  and 2Q  is used as the revolute axis, 
and 1u  and 2u  represent the directions of the 
two prismatic joints. The link connecting the 
spherical joint 1A  and the revolute axis is on 
the straight line which is through point 1A  and 
perpendicular to L’. The remaining two chains 
of the two manipulators can be generated by 
similar procedures. The related data of the 
isotropic designs with one specified link 
parameter can be used as the initial values to 
develop almost isotropic designs with more 
desired link parameters.  
IV. Objective function for almost isotropic 
designs 
 
 If i is ui  yields the same non-zero value for i = 
1, 2,.., 6, then the closeness to an isotropy 
configuration can be evaluated by the 
previously proposed normalized isotropy 
measure [6]:

where ( 3Pσ , 1Pσ ) and ( 3oσ , 1oσ ) denote pairs of 
the smallest and largest singular values of the 
two 3 x 6 submatrices (denoted by PH  and oH ) 
consisting of the first three rows and the last 
three rows of matrix H in Eq. (1) respectively, 
and 3σ and 1σ denote respectively the smallest 
and largest singular values of tP oH H   in which 
PH   and oH  are two matrices with 
orthonormal row vectors that span the same row 
spaces of PH  and oH  respectively. The 
measure yields the optimum value of one at 
isotropic configurations, so μ  can be used as 
the objective function in an optimization 
method for developing almost isotropic designs. 
The measure is independent of the size of a 
manipulator and the physical unit of H, but it is 
not zero at singular configurations (except for 
some special cases where the row vectors of oH  
or PH  are linear dependent, or the row vectors 
 15
mean value of oμ  evaluated at the same number 
of grid points that are homogeneously 
distributed within the intersection of the two 
joint spaces: mρΔ = 10 and nρΔ = 3. The results 
give 0.8382 and 0.8369 for the isotropic design 
and the almost isotropic design respectively. It 
shows that the two designs have nearly 
identical global isotropy.   
VI. A 3-PPRS almost isotropic design 
 
 It is difficult to develop the almost isotropic 
design with PPSR chains shown in Fig. 1b using 
a similar approach because we cannot find a 
solution from Table 2 with kz wi close to one 
and 2k-1 2ku ui  close to zero. Therefore, we 
directly employ an optimization method to 
develop the desired manipulator. Besides the 
z-coordinate of the TCP, the design variables for 
the directions of is  and the directions of the 
prismatic joints are defined as

 The number of variables can be significantly

equations: 
 
        2j-1 2js ui = 2j 2j-1s ui = 0  for j = 1, 2, 3 (8) 
and 
1 1s ui = 2 2s ui = 3 3s ui = 4 4s ui  = 5 5s ui = λ=6 6s ui (9) 
 
where 0 1λ< ≤ . Higher resolution in position or 
force control can be obtained for a smaller λ . 
First, solving 1 1s ui = λ  and 1 2s ui = 0 yields

            (10) 
 
Next, 1cη  of unit vector 1s  can be expressed as   
 
2 2
1 1 1 1 11 ( ) ( )c c s s sη γ η γ η= ± − −        (11) 
 
Substituting Eq. (10) into (11) gives 
 
2
1 1cη λ= ± −                (12) 
 
Either positive or negative sign of 1cη  can be 
used. In this paper, we will use positive 1cη  for 
further analysis. After solving for the remaining 
is  by a similar procedure, we obtain

Therefore, elements of matrix H can be 
expressed as functions of z, 1 2 3, ,θ θ θ  and λ . We 
can provide λ  and then optimize oμ  to obtain 
the design with desired resolution. In this paper, 
we use λ  as a variable. Using an optimization 
software, we obtain oμ = 0.8247 with 
1 344.98θ = ° , 2 104.97θ = ° , 3 225θ = ° , z = 30.6529 
and λ = 0.7555. Vectors is  and iu  for i = 1, 
2, ..., 6 can be obtained by back substitutions. 
With ′ =i ie s , the obtained results are given in 
Table 4. There are six free parameters that can 
be used to specify the three revolute joint axis, 
so many almost isotropic designs can be 
obtained following the same procedure 
(with ie replaced by ′ie ) in developing the 
3-PPSR isotropic design in Fig. 4.  .  
VII. Conclusion  
 
 Methods for developing 3-PRPS and 3-PPSR 
isotropic or almost isotropic manipulators have 
been proposed in this work. Two special 
isotropy generators and some related data were 
presented that can be directly used for 
developing isotropic designs or used as the 
initial values for developing almost isotropic 
designs with desired link parameters. The 
related data of a 3-PRPS isotropic design were 
used as the initial values to develop an almost 
3-PRPS isotropic design with simple link 
parameters, and a general optimization method 
was proposed for developing almost isotropic 
3-PPSR designs whose prismatic axes lie in a 
horizontal plane, and the two prismatic axes on 
each chain are perpendicular. Many isotropic or
