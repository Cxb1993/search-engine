英文摘要：Among proposed deniable authentication protocols, the non-interactive protocols have better 
performance than the interactive protocols for the reduction of communication cost.  Moreover, some 
non-interactive protocols protect the privacy and the benefit of the sender.  Recently some interactive 
protocols provide confidentiality while those proposed non-interactive protocols do not.  However, the 
transferring data may damage the privacy and benefit of the sender or receiver.  To reduce the additional cost 
by directly applying symmetric cryptosystems, a promised signcryption scheme is first proposed.  By 
adopting our new promised signcryption scheme, the first efficient non-interactive deniable authentication 
protocol with confidentiality and anonymous signer protections is proposed.

二、前言與研究目的 
Deniable authentication protocols satisfy the deniability and intended receiver properties.  Only the 
intended receiver can identify the source of given messages, but he/she cannot prove this source to the third 
party.  Dwork et al. [1] first proposed a deniable authentication protocol based on concurrent zero-knowledge 
proof in 1998.  Dwork et al.’s protocol has a time constraint and their proof of knowledge is restrained from a 
time delay in the authentication process.  To improve the efficiency of Dwork et al.’s protocol, Aumann and 
Robin [2] proposed their deniable authentication protocol based on factoring problem.  In 2001, Deng et al. 
[3] also proposed two deniable authentication protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem and the 
factoring problem, respectively.  But both Aumann and Robin’s and Deng’s protocols require a trusted public 
directory between the sender and receiver.  In 2002, Fan et al. [4] also proposed a deniable authentication 
protocol based on Diffie-Hellman key distribution protocol.  The proposed protocols [1-4] described above 
are interactive.  Their performance is inefficient because the sender and the receiver need to communicate 
with each other several rounds in the interactive deniable authentication protocols 
To reduce the communication cost, the non-interactive deniable authentication protocols are proposed.  
It is only once time to transfer data from the sender to the receiver.  Shao [5] pointed out that some proposed 
interactive deniable authentication protocols [1-4] do not satisfy the intended receiver property in 2004.  
Then Shao first proposed a non-interactive deniable authentication protocol based on the generalized ElGamal 
signature scheme.  To reduce the communication cost between the sender and receiver, Lee et al. [6] 
proposed their non-interactive protocol based on generalized ElGamal signature scheme.  To prove the 
deniability and unforgeability, Wang and Song [7] proposed a security model based on designated verifier 
proofs for non-interactive deniable protocols. 
The deniable authentication protocol provides deniability since both the sender and the receiver can 
generate the same authenticator to pass the verification.  Since receivers have the same ability as senders, a 
malicious receiver is able to forge a valid authenticator to injure the sender.  To avoid the injuring problem

To reduce the computational cost of signing and encrypting, in 1997, Zheng [13] proposed a signcryption 
scheme.  However, the signcryption scheme satisfies non-repudiation property, the signcryption scheme 
cannot be directly used in a deniable authentication protocol.  To decrease the influence of the 
non-repudiation property, a promised signcryption scheme is first proposed.  By adopting the promised 
signcryption scheme, our efficient non-interactive deniable authentication protocol with confidentiality and 
sender protection is proposed. 
 
五、結果與討論 
Our Promised Signcryption Scheme 
Our promised signcryption scheme consists of three algorithms: Setup, Promised-Signcryption, and 
Promised-Unsigncryption algorithms.  Setup algorithm is used to construct and publish the functions and 
parameters.  Promised-Signcryption algorithm is used to generate the promised signcryptext containing its 
promise on the message m.  Promised-Unsigncryption algorithm is used to authenticate and decrypt the 
promised signcryptext only by the intended receiver.  In the following, our scheme is described. 
Setup: 
Choose two large public prime numbers p and q such that q|(p-1) after giving a security parameter l.  
Find the public parameter g is an element in Zp
*
 with order q.  Choose the public symmetric-key encryption 
and decryption functions Ek(m) and Dk(m) to encrypt and decrypt a message m with a session key k.  Publish 
two one-way hash functions H1(.) and H2(.), where the function H1(.) maps from {0,1}
*
 to Zq
*
 and the function 
H2(.) maps from {0,1}* to {0,1}
l
, where l is the length of a bit string.  Every user i have a public/private key 
pair (yi, xi), where xi is randomly chosen from Zq
*
 and yi = g
xi mod p. 
Promised-Signcryption 
Suppose the sender A wants to send a promised signcryptext on the message m to an intended receiver B 
in an authenticated way.  Sender A generates and sends the promised signcryptext by the following steps. 
Step 1: Choose two random integers R and k in Zq
*
. 
Step 2: Compute V = H1(g
k
 mod p||m||R||y
B
). 
Step 3: Compute s = k + Vx
A
 mod p and S = g
s
 mod p. 
Step 4: Compute K = H2((yB)
s
 mod p). 
Step 5: Encrypt the message m by performing the symmetry encryption function C = EK(m||R). 
Finally, the sender A transmits the promised signcryptext (C, V, S) to the intended receiver B, where (V, S) is 
the corresponding promise. 
Promised-Unsigncryption 
After receiving the promised signcryptext (C, V, S), the intended receiver B decrypts and verifies the 
promised signcryptext by the following steps. 
Step 1: Compute K = H2(S
xB mod p). 
Step 2: Obtain the message m and the random number R by performing the decryption m||R = DK(C). 
Step 3: Verify whether or not V = H1(SyA
-V
 mod p||m||R||yB).  If the equation V = H1(SyA
-V 
mod 
p||m||R||y
B
) hold, the intended receiver B trusts that the message m is really sent by Sender A; 
otherwise, B rejects the promised signcryptext (C, V, S).

one modular exponential operation is denoted by Te and the symmetric encryption/decryption is denoted by 
Tsym. 
In our protocol, the computation cost of sender is 3Te+1Tsym.  The computation cost of receiver is 
2Te+Tsym.  Our protocol takes 5Te+2Tsym totally.  Both Hwang and Ma’s DAP-ASP, and Hwang and Chao’s 
DAP-ASP adopt the consecutive modular exponential operation a1
e1a2
e2
 whose computation cost is 1.16Te 
[17].  The total computation cost of Hwang and Ma’s DAP-ASP is 5.41Te.  Our protocol reduces the total 
cost of Hwang and Ma’s DAP-ASP 0.41Te- 2Tsym.  Compared with Hwang and Chao’s DAP-ASP, our 
protocol provides confidentiality by paying 0.68Te+ 2Tsym additionally.  The extra computation cost paid by 
our protocol is used to provide confidentiality.  Since the confidentiality makes deniable authentication 
protocols be practical, this extra cost is reasonable. 
The communication cost consists of two parts.  One is the message/ciphertext part and the other is the 
deniable part.  Compared with Hwang and Ma’s protocol, our protocol saves 2|q| communication cost for the 
deniable part.  Compared with Hwang and Chao’s protocol, our protocol also saves |p| communication cost 
for the deniable part.  Therefore, our protocol pays less communication cost than the cost that Hwang and 
Ma’s, and Hwang and Chao’s protocol pay. 
The communication cost of the message part is complicated.  Among the three protocols, only Hwang 
and Chao’s DAP-ASP has message length restriction.  When the message length is less than |p|, all three 
protocols pay the same communication cost.  When the message length is large than |p|, our protocol, and 
Hwang and Ma’s DAP-ASP pay the same communication cost.  However, Hwang and Chao’s DAP-ASP is 
not suitable for the message length that is large than |p|.  According to the above analysis, our protocol has 
more slight communication cost and more flexible size of the transferring message.

protocol pays some extra computational cost.  But this extra cost is reasonable to provide the additional 
property: Confidentiality.  On the other hand, our new protocol has a slight communication cost and a 
flexible size for the transferring message.  Finally, our result achieves all the goals of this project.
