This project focused on the development of, high-power HBT, which are widely used 
in 3-G communication MMIC system on chip for using in application to wireless 
communication and SOC. Further improvements will be made in AlGaAs/GaAs and 
InGaP/GaAs HBT’s that are the most important and the most popular microwave devices in 
present researching and industrial areas. We developed a new emitter-base graded-like 
junction utilized a multiple quantum well emitter (MQWE). This new approach is very 
promising in simplifying epitaxial growth procedures, modulating the composition of a 
wide-gap material and is suitable for those compound alloys that are not lattice-matched. 
Concerning with device performances, a reduced E-B turn-on voltage is expected to further 
scale down the turn-on voltage and knee voltage and increase the input signal amplitude 
area. Moreover, better characteristics are available due to the formation of built-in field in 
multiple quantum well. To be suitable for large current output, we provide the multiple 
quantum well collector with the build-in voltage to overcome the Kink effect in large 
current output operation. Considering the Early effect, self-heating, high-inject and 
resistance effect, we based on the DD Model to deduce the large signal equivalent circuit 
model of heterojunction bipolar transistor. The thermal stability and reliability with 
implemented devices will be studied by thermal oxidization, in particular those with high Al 
mole fraction. Effects of built-in field on device performances and passivation-layer (such as 
Al-oxide) effects will be also investigated. Then GaN-based HBT’s are designed and 
fabricated to improve some a large conduction-band discontinuity base on the development 
and modeling mechanism associated with AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaP/GaAs.

Socieare measured I-V characteristics for a fabricated HEJ at 300 K, and
the calculated  is 1.049.
In order to realize and investigate the contribution of the diffu-
sion current and recombination current, we introduced a p-n junction
equivalent circuit model named the DD model and a numerical
method that could be used to extract the parameters in this model to
represent the p-n junction. This circuit model is based on assump-
tions that might always be valid. The main assumption is that of
linearity, namely that the current flowing through the device is
mainly a superposition of two currents, one due to carrier diffusion
and the other due to carrier recombination. Other current compo-
nents are neglected. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the model configura-
tion. The DD model is represented by two parallel diodes; one cor-
responds to the diffusion current Jd and the other corresponds to
Figure 1. Band diagram of a fabricated a HOJ and b HEJ. Each device
structure is in the respective inset.

voltage.the recombination current Jr. According to Eq. 1, the  is replaced
with 1 and 2 to describe Jd and Jr, respectively. If we also assume
VD  3 kT/q, then
Jd = JdseqVD/1kT 2
Jr = JrseqVD/2kT 3
where Jds is the reverse saturation current density of diffusion and
Jrs is the saturation current density of recombination. The current of
the p-n junction can be written as
J = Jd + Jr = JdseqVD/1kT + JrseqVD/2kT 4
Knowing VA, VB, and device-related parameters, we can solve
simultaneous equations and then finally obtain both Jds and Jrs cur-
rent components for the p-n junction
JseqVA/kT = JdseqVA/1kT + JrseqVA/2kT 5
JseqVB/kT = JdseqVB/1kT + JrseqVB/2kT 6
In the cause of considering the effects of series resistance and
measured or applied external voltages, the current of the p-n junc-
tion is then rewritten as
J = JdseqVD−JRD/1kT + JrseqVD−JRD/2kT 7
where RD is the series resistance. A typical I-V characteristic of the
p-n junction in forward bias is shown in Fig. 3. Accordingly, device
parameters such as Jds, Jrs, , and RD are extracted. Also shown in
Fig. 3 are the summarized device parameters that are used in the
next section.
Experimental
Shown in Fig. 4a are measured and calculated current densities
as a function of applied voltage for an HEJ at different ambient
temperatures. Clearly, all measured and calculated results are in
good agreement with each other. The valance-band discontinuity
EV located at the InGaP/GaAs heterojunction prevents additional
holes from being injected across the space-charge region to establish
the minority-carrier hole concentration in the n region. Thus, the
recombination current in the space-charge region is small enough to
be neglected. At a low forward-biased VD with every temperature
condition, the carrier injection is very weak, so the minority carrier
generated at the space-charge edges is very small to further cause
the slightly Jd. Therefore, the Jr current component is dominant and
 is close to 2. With increasing VD, the carrier injection becomes

large. The Jd is increased as the expqVD/kT factor but the Jr is
increased as the expqVD/2kT factor. Therefore, the Jd current com-
ponent is dominant and  is 1.049. At high VD, the huge p-n junc-
SocieIn a homojunction, the acceptor concentration NA is far greater
than the donor concentration ND. The electron diffusion can be
neglected. The Jds of HOJ Jds-HO is written as

Both Jds-HE and Jds-HO are a function of thermal-equilibrium con-
centrations of the minority carrier pno, npo. These concentrations of
the minority carrier vary as ni

, which has a very strong dependence
on ambient temperature. Both Jds-HE and Jds-HO increase with the
ambient temperature as the exp −Eg/kT factor, which is dominant
despite that Vp, NC, and NV are a function of ambient temperature.
Figure 5 also shows the calculated saturation current density of
recombination Jrs as a function of ambient temperature for both
kinds of p-n heterojunction and homojunction. The Jrs can be ex-
pressed as9
JrsT =

where WT is the space-charge width and r is the recombination
life time. We replace the parameters of Jrs, W, and r to Jrs-HE, WHE,
and r-HE to obtain the saturation current density of recombination in
HEJ and Jrs-HO, WHO, and r-HO in HOJ, respectively. We denote the
r-HE and r-HO as the average recombination lifetime that the
electron-hole pair recombines in the HEJ and HOJ, respectively.
Though W and r are dependent on ambient temperature, both Jrs-HE
and Jrs-HO vary as ni and increase with the ambient temperature as
the dominant the factor of exp−Eg/2kT.
In order to investigate the details of the influence of ambient
temperature on saturation current density of diffusion and one of
recombination, the Vp and Vn are deduced from Eq. 11 and 12, to
obtain

where Wn is the width of the space-charge region extending into the
n region, Wp is the width of the space-charge region extending into
the p region, ni-InGaP is the intrinsic carrier concentration of InGaP,
and ni-GaAs is the intrinsic carrier concentration of GaAs.
Figure 7 shows the calculated average recombination lifetime as
a function of ambient temperature. The calculated average recombi-
nation lifetime of the heterojunction and homojunction r-HE, r-HO
increases from 182.027 to 6.706 s and 13.649 to 0.245 s, respec-
tively, as the temperature increases from 300 to 425 K. The r-HE is
smaller than r-HO because the intrinsic carrier concentration of
InGaP ni = 220 cm−3 is smaller than that of GaAs ni = 2.1
 106 cm−3 despite that the Wn and Wp ratio is 100. The contribu-
tion of Wn  ni-InGaP term can be neglected. Therefore, the space-
charge region of the heterojunction is smaller than that of the homo-
junction. Unfortunately, the recombination current of the
heterojunction is larger than that of the homojunction. We can con-
clude that the recombination center in the heterojunction is more
than that in the homojunction. The r-HE and r-HO vary as T−9.5.
Conclusions
In summary, fabrication, characterization, and modeling of the
p-n junction were investigated with different ambient temperature
conditions. Not only the analysis results of the heterojunction but
also those of the homojunction were provided for the p-n junction
structure design and characteristic study in HBT, CAMFET, and so
on. The measured I-V characteristic results with different ambient
temperature conditions were in good agreement with the calculated
results using the DD model. The Vp, Vn, r-HE, and r-HO can be
deduced from the extracted Jd and Jr current density components.
The experimental and modeling results indicate that i the DD
model really can describe the p-n junction I-V characteristics with
forward bias, ii the numerical method could be used to extract the
parameters in this model to represent the p-n junction, and iii the

ZnO thin films were deposited on the quartz substrate 
by the RF magnetron sputtering method and some of the 
samples were annealed in N2 ambient at atmospheric 
pressure in a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process at 
different selected temperature of 400 600 and 800 °C, 
respectively. The effects of RTA- treated ZnO thin films 
are studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for the 
structural investigation, atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
for the surface morphology and room temperature 
photoluminescence (PL) is used to investigate the optical 
properties. 
Fig. 1 displays the XRD spectra of the as-deposited 
and RTA-treated ZnO/Quartz thin films in the 2Θ (degree) 
range of 33 – 36°. All of the films almost show a 
pronounced about 34.4° corresponding to (002) peak of 
JCPDS No. 36-1451 for ZnO structure, indicative of 
preferential orientation with the c-axis and the RTA-
treated sample at 600 °C have a stronger intensity [1].  
Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology variations of as-
deposited and ZnO/Quartz thin films from the observed 
AFM images. It is shown that the morphology of 
ZnO/Quartz thin films has been changed and the mean 
roughness (Ra) is 8 nm for as-deposited samples and 14 
nm for RTA-treated samples, respectively.  
Displayed in Fig. 3 is the PL spectra of the as-
deposited and RTA-treated ZnO thin films over the 
wavelength range of 335 – 450 nm at 300 K. These 
spectra are characterized by the observed PL emission in 
the UV wavelengths, peaking around 375 – 380 nm 
(indicated as arrow signs) [2].  
 In conclusion, both  structural and optical properties 
show the some variations for the RTA-treated samples 
comparing with the as-deposited materials. The detailed 
experiment procedure and explanation will be compared 
and discussed.

N-p-n InGaP/GaAs Dual-Emitter heterojunction phototransistor 
(DEPT) with/without InGaP-passivation layer have been fabricated 
to investigate the influence of surface leakage on the device optical 
performance. The comparison between DEPT with a voltage-
biased emitter and HPT with a voltage-biased base is also included. 
There are four (three) operating regions appearing in the optical 
characteristics of the DEPT (HPT): negative-saturation, negative-
tuning, positive-tuning, and positive-saturation (cut-off, tuning, 
and saturation) regions. The InGaP-passivated DEPT with the 
extrinsic base surface passivated by InGaP, exhibits the maximum 
optical gains of 46.57, 46.86 and 47.39 while the non-passivated 
one shows those of 32.02, 33.55 and 33.57 under the optical 
powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. However, the 
optical gains are only in the range of 0.93~2.0 (0.83~1.64) for the 
InGaP-passivated HPT (non-passivated HPT) for all the 
illuminating conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
For optical communication applications, the important issue is to realize an optical 
receiver with the features of compact, high-speed, low-power consumption, and high 
optical detection efficiency. Nowadays, the Ⅲ-Ⅴ compound semiconductor-based 
heterojuntion phototransistors (HPT’s) have been widely investigated and paid more 
interest in employment rather than the p-i-n photodiode and the avalanche photodiode 
(APD) (1-4). Since the work on InP/InGaAs HPT with a base terminal (called 3T-HPT) 
was initiated by Chandrasekhar et al. (5, 6), performance enhancement of InGaP/GaAs 
3T-HPT was reported by Sridhara et al. (7). Bansropun et al. then reported the evidence 
of optical gain improvement in AlGaAs/GaAs 3T-HPT using an emitter shoulder 
structure (8). Recently optical characteristics of InGaP/GaAs 3T-HPTs with ledge emitter 
Then the AuGe dual-emitter metals together with the patterned photoresist were used as 
an etching mask to selectively remove the GaAs cap layer ( or both of the GaAs cap layer 
and the InGaP emitter layer) for the InGaP-passivated (non-passivated) DEPT, named P-
DEPT (NP-DEPT). The mixture solutions used for etching the InGaP and GaAs layers 
were 1H3PO4:1HCl and 3NH4OH:1H2O2:50H2O, respectively. For the collector contact, 
the emitter mesa was performed till the sub-collector layer to deposit AuGe metal as the 
collector electrode. The exposed optical absorption area between these two emitters is 
4×10-4 cm2. Both a P- and a NP-HBT/HPT with a base electrode were also fabricated on 
the same chip using the standard triple-mesa processes. The P- and NP-HBTs/HPTs also 
exhibit both of an absorption area of 4×10-4 cm2 and a total emitter area of 150×150 µm2. 
The optical performance for all fabricated HBTs/HPTs and DEPTs was measured using a  
semiconductor laser operating at 850 nm.

(b) without InGaP-passivation layer. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
Figure 2 shows the Gummel plots for the P- and NP-HBT/HPT measured in the dark. It is 
found that both of the collector current characteristics for the P- and NP-HBT are almost 
identical. Both calculated collector current ideality factors are 1.02. On the other hand, 
the base current for the P-HBT is found to be much smaller than that for the NP-HBT in 
the small VBE regime. It proves the suppression of surface recombination current via the 
utilization of InGaP-passivation layer. The base ideality factor for the P-HBT is 1.12 
while it is 1.50 for the NP-HBT. At the base current density of JB=10-3 A/cm2, the P-HBT 
(NP-HBT) exhibits a dc current gain β(P)(JB)=39 (β(NP)(JB)=13), which is 75% (28%) of 
the saturated value of 52 (46).

that of the B-E1 junction, so the collector photocurrents for the P- and NP-DEPT are 
simplified as 
 
 
 
 
where Ip=Ip1+Ip2 (I p1=0.8Ip, I p2= 0.2Ip) and Jp= Jp1=Jp2=Ip/(AE1+AE2). In other words, the 
collector photocurrent ∆ICP at VE2=0 V is determined by both the β(Jp) and Ip. According 
to the results in Figs. 2, the P-DEPT always operates with a higher dc current gain than 
that of the NP-DEPT at the same base-current level (i.e., β(P)(JB) > β(NP)(JB)) . The larger

are 44.99 (27.31), 45.47 (29.19) and 46.10 (29.55) for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and

under optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively, the P-DEPT (NP-DEHPT) 
exhibits the comparative larger (smaller) optical gain in saturation region. To compare 
with the P- and NP-HPT, the obtained optical gains (Gs) as a function of the base-emitter 
voltage (VBE) are shown in Fig. 6. The Gs are in the range of 0.93~2.0 (0.83~1.64) that 
are much smaller than those of DEPTs. The improved Ip together with the enhanced 
transistor dc current gain results in the enhanced optical gains for the P-HPT than that for 
the NP-HPT. However, most of the Ip flowing out of the base terminal makes the Gs 
much smaller than that of the DEPTs. Besides, almost no optical power-tunable optical 
gains observed while there are only voltage-tunable ones.

We report on InGaP/GaAs Dual-Emitter HPTs 
(DEHPTs) with and without extrinsic base surface 
passivation. There are four operating regions appearing in 
the output characteristics of DEHPTs under illumination: 
negative-saturation, negative-tuning, positive-tuning and 
positive-saturation regions. The InGaP-passivated 
DEHPT (P-DEHPT), i.e. DEHPT with the extrinsic base 
surface passivated by InGaP, exhibits the enhanced 
optical gains. However, the NP-DEHPT exhibits the 
larger peak gain-tuning efficiency compared to P-DEHPT 
for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. 
The better tuning efficiency makes the NP-DEHPT a 
possible application in low-optical power optoelectronic 
application.  
As shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), the proposed DEHPTs 
with and without the InGaP-passivation layer were 
fabricated to have dual emitters, a common floating base 
and a common collector. The emitter areas (AE1 and AE2) 
for the E1 and E2 electrodes are 120×150 and 30×150 
µm2, respectively. The exposed optical absorption area 
between these two emitters is 4×10-4 cm2.  
The DEHPT was operated with the configuration that 
one of the emitters (E1) was grounded while the other (E2) 
functioned as the control terminal (applied voltage VE2) 
[1]. The VCE1 was maintained at 2 V during the variation 
of VE2 from -0.4 to 0.4 V. Shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(c) are the 
optical gains G(P) and G(NP), which shows the higher G(P)s 
for the P-DEHPT. The optical gain can be expressed as G 
= hν×∆ICP/(q×Pin) with the assumed quantum efficiency 
of 100%, where hν is the photon’s energy, q is the 
elementary charge, ∆ICP is the measured collector 
photocurrent, and Pin is the optical power. The G(P)s 
(G(NP)s) for the P-DEHPT (NP-DEHPT) operated in the 
negative-saturation region are 46.57 (32.02), 46.86 (33.55) 
and 47.39 (33.57), and in the positive-saturation region 
are 44.99 (27.31), 45.47 (29.19) and 46.10 (29.55) for 
optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. 
When comparing the above G(P)s (G(NP)s) obtained with 
those at VE2=0 V, 44.63 (26.33), 45.14 (28.29) and 45.79 
(28.73) for the P-DEHPT (NP-DEHPT) for optical 
powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively, the P-
DEHPT (NP-DEHPT) exhibits the comparative larger 
(smaller) optical gain in saturation region. Figures 3(a)-
3(c) show the gain-tuning efficiency (ηG(P) and ηG(NP)) as a 
function of VE2 for the P- and NP-DEHPT, where the 
gain-tuning efficiency (ηG) is defined as ηG 
=∣dG/dVE2∣. Similar to the previous results it is found 
that (i) the ηG(NP)s for the NP-DEHPT are larger than 
ηG(P)s for the P-DEHPT and (ii) a peak observed in the 
negative-tuning region is higher than that in the positive-
tuning region for the P- and NP-DEHPTs. The peak ηG(P)s 
(ηG(NP)s) in the negative-tuning region are 12.76 (37.35), 
13.71 (41.03) and 16.01 (44.10) V-1 for the P-DEHPT 
(NP-DEHPT) under the optical power of 17.5, 13.2 and 
8.62 µW, respectively. 
    On the basis of the experimental results, we conclude 
that (1) the passivation-layer plays an important role in 
the DEHPT optical performance and (2) the DEHPT with 
voltage- and power-tunable optical gains has potential for 
low-power optical application.

structure to passivate the surface of extricsic base have also been investigated (9). One of 
the key advantages of InGaP/GaAs system over AlGaAs/GaAs one is that a high etching 
selectivity between InGaP and GaAs layer. The key feature of 3T-HPT is that an 
additional dc base bias is used to push the quiescent point to a higher level where the 
current gain is larger. There are two typical ways to provide the dc base bias. 3T-HPTs 
with a base biased using a current source have been demonstrated to exhibit enhanced 
performance (10). However, Tan et al. concluded that 3T-HPT with a base biased using a 
voltage source shows degraded optical gains as compared to HPT with a floating base. 
On the other hand, fabrication of 3T-HPTs needs additional processing steps and total 
device area due to the formation of base electrode. 
More recently, Tan et al. reported a new 3T-HPT with double emitters (DEPT) and 
concluded that (i) a differential voltage between these two emitters can be used to tune 
and enhance the collector photocurrent and (ii) not only a small positive but also a small 
negative differential voltage between these two emitters can be used to enhance the 
collector photocurrent (11). These characteristics are particular beneficial because the 
voltage-bias circuit is commonly used in practice. Although there is a considerable 
interest in the proposed DEPT structure due to its enhanced performance as well as its 
low voltage operation, to date there has been no study on employing the device with an 
InGaP layer for passivating the exposed base layer. Due to high surface recombination 
velocity of free GaAs surface, large surface recombination current and decgraded dc 
current gain would be adverse the performance of the conventional InGaP/GaAs 
HBT/HPT. Utilizing InGaP layer to passivate the exposed extrinsic base and further 
suppress the surface recombination current, an improvement in dc current gain can be 
achieved. Theoretically, the optical performance of DEPT with InGaP-passivation layer, 
such as collector photocurrent and optical gain, could be enhanced. 
In this paper, we focus on the comparative studies of the optical performance of 
InGaP/GaAs DEPTs with and without an InGaP passivation layer. In section 2, we 
describe the device fabrication of the DEPTs with and without an InGaP passivation layer, 
including that of conventional HBTs/HPTs with and without an InGaP passivation layer 
(named P- and NP-HBTs/HPTs) fabricated on the same chip. Both of the P- and NP-
HBTs/HPTs were fabricated to have a base electrode. In section 3, the differences in the 
optical performance between the DEPTs with and without an InGaP passivation layer are 
presented. The optical characterization addressed includes the collector photocurrent, 
optical gain, current- and gain-tuning efficiency, optical-gain variation, and gain 
enhancement factor. Finally, a conclusion is made.  
. 
2. Experiments 
 
The epi-structure used in this study was grown on a (100)-oriented semi-insulating 
GaAs substrate by LP-MOCVD. It consists of, from the substrate up, a 0.5-µm n+-GaAs 
sub-collector (n+=5×1018 cm-3), a 0.6-µm n−-GaAs collector (n−=5×1016 cm-3), a 0.14-µm 
p+-GaAs base (p+=4×1019 cm-3), a 0.07-µm n-InGaP emitter (n=5×1017 cm-3) and a 0.3-
µm n+-GaAs cap layer (n+=5×1018 cm-3). Carbon and silicon were used as p- and n-type 
dopants, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), the proposed DEPTs with and 
without the InGaP-passivation layer were fabricated to have dual emitters, a common 
floating base and a common collector. The fabrication procedure began with AuGe metal 
deposition upon the cap layer with patterned dual-emitter formation. The emitter areas 
(AE1 and AE2) for the E1 and E2 electrodes are 120×150 and 30×150 µm2, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2  Gummel plots of the P- and NP-HBTs. 
 
         The photocurrents of the  P- and NP-HBTs/HPTs are defined as Ip(P) and Ip(NP), 
respectively. The measured Ip(P)s (Ip(NP)s) within the parasitic p-i-n diode (formed by base, 
collector, and subcollector) are 5.5 (5), 8.4 (7.7) and 11.2 (10) µA for optical powers of 
8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. The photocurrents were measured for the 
HBT/HPT in the emitter-floated configuration where an independent voltage source VCB 
was connected between the collector and base. Apparently, the photocurrent for the 
passivated device reaches about 10% larger than that for the non-passivated one under the 
same optical power. We define the collector photocurrents (∆ICPs) as ∆ICP(P)s and 
∆ICP(NP)s for the P- and NP-DEPTs, respectively. Figures 3(a)-3(c) show the measured 
collector photocurrents (∆ICP(P)s and ∆ICP(NP)s) as a function of the voltage difference of 
these two emitters VE2 for the P- and NP-DEPT under a series of different levels of 
optical power. There are four operating regions in the current-voltage characteristics for 
both P- and NP-DEPT: negative-saturation, negative-tuning, positive-tuning and positive-
saturation regions. Basically, the collector photocurrent of the DEPT is attributed to the 
sum of currents injected from the B-E1 and B-E2 junctions [16]. Since the DEPT has a 
common floating base-collector junction, the photocurrent generated within the parasitic 
p-i-n diode takes the role of the base biasing current. In addition to the base-current-
density dependent current gains (β(J)), the current injection capabilities of the B-E1 and 
B-E2 junctions are also determined by the currents (Ip1 and Ip2) coming from the 
photocurrent (Ip). Thus the collector photocurrents for the P- and NP-DEPT can be 
obtained as 
 
 
 
                                                                
                                                                                              
 
 
where the Jp1=Ip1/AE1, Jp2=Ip2/AE2 and the Ip1 and Ip2 are the photocurrents flowing across  
the B-E1 and B-E2 junctions, respectively. The index, (P) and (NP), stands for the 
parameters for the P- and NP-DEPT, respectively. The VE2-dependent photocurrent 
density across the B-E junctions are calculated according to the earlier report (11) and 
shown in Fig. 4.

Ip(P) obtained in the P-DEPT further yields a higher current gain β(P)(Jp(P)) as compared to 
NP-DEPT. This explains why the measured collector photocurrents at VE2=0 V of 263.5, 
408.1 and 548.8 µA for the P-DEPT under optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, 
respectively, are much larger than those of 155.4, 255.7 and 344.3 µA for the NP-DEPT. 
Increasing negative VE2 leads the B-E2 junction to operate with the relatively more 
forward-biased capability while the B-E1 junction operates with the less. It eventuates in 
operating in the negative-saturation region. The B-E2 junction dominates the operation 
while the B-E1 junction is off-conduction. Hence the photocurrent generated within the 
parasitic p-i-n diode flows totally across the B-E2 junction, resulting in a Jp2 (Ip/AE2) that 
is 5-fold that of the case at VE2=0 V (Ip/(AE1+AE2)). When the device operates in the 
negative-saturation region, the saturated collector photocurrents for the P- and NP-DEPT 
totally come from the B-E2 junction and are expressed as 
 
 
                 .                              
 
The measured values are 274.9 (189.0), 423.5 (303.3) and 567.9 (402.3) µA for the P-
DEPT (NP-DEPT) for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 µW, respectively. These 
results are in good agreement with what is expected based on the increased dc current 
obtained at a larger JB as shown in Fig. 2. By contrast, increasing positive VE2 activates 
the B-E1 junction and simultaneously weakens the B-E2 junction conduction capability. 
The DEPT operates eventually in the positive-saturation region shown in Fig. 3. The 
magnitude of the shared Ip1 is identical to Ip while the Ip2 is zero. Therefore, the current 
density is 1.25-fold that of the case at VE2=0 V, where the collector photocurrents coming 
totally from the B-E1 junction are expressed as 
 
                  .                           
 
 
In this case, the saturated ∆ICP(P)s (∆ICP(NP)s) are 265.6 (161.2), 411.0 (263.9) and 
552.4 (354.2) µA for the P-DEPT (NP-DEPT) for optical powers of 8.62, 13.2 and 17.5 
µW, respectively. What the results in Figs. 3(a)-3(c) make clear are that (i) the collector 
photocurrents are always comparative larger when the device operates in the negative-
saturation region (due to the current density-dependent dc current gain β(5Jp)> β(1.25 
Jp)> β(Jp)), (ii) the higher the optical power is, the larger the collector photocurrent can be 
obtained and (iii) the P-DEPT always exhibits a larger collector photocurrent than that for 
the NP-DEPT under the same optical power. Furthermore, another advantage for the P-
DEPT is that the ∆ICP(P) can be obtained larger than ∆ICP(NP) for the NP-DEPT even when 
the P-DEPT is illuminated under a lower optical power.  
Shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(c) are the optical gains G(P) and G(NP), which shows the higher 
G(P)s for the P-DEPT. The optical gain can be expressed as G = hν×∆ICP/(q×Pin), where 
hν is the photon’s energy, q is the elementary charge and Pin is the optical power. We 
define the optical gains (Gs) as G(P)s and G(NP)s for the P- and NP-DEPT, respectively.

ηGs obtained in the tuning region for the P-HPT (NP-HPT) are 5.52 (4.22), 5.36 (3.94), 
and 5.35 (3.86) V-1 under the optical power of 8.62, 13.2, and 17.5 µW, respectively. For 
the P-DEPT (NP-DEPT), shown in 8(a)-8(c), the peak ηG(P)s (ηG(NP)s) in the negative-
tuning region are 12.76 (37.35), 13.71 (41.03) and 16.01 (44.10) V-1 under the optical 
power of 17.5, 13.2 and 8.62 µW, respectively.  The peak values of ηG are found higher 
for the NP-DEPT (P-HPT) than that for the P-DEPT (NP-HPT). In addition, DEPTs 
shows much enhanced ηGs as compared to HPTs.

4. Conclusion 
 
The proposed InGaP/GaAs dual-emitter phototransistors with/without InGaP-
passivation layer have been successfully fabricated and investigated. In the above 
discussion, we mainly addressed the effects of what difference an InGaP passivation 
layer induces in the DEHPT and HPT optical characteristics. The results show that (i) the 
P-DEPT exhibits relatively larger magnitude of collector photocurrents and optical gains 
than those for the NP-DEPT and (ii) the NP-DEPT presents relatively better current- and 
gain-tuning efficiency than that for the P-DEHPT. The differences between the optical 
characteristics of passivated- and nonpassivated-devices are due to the different generated 
photocurrents and dc current gain characteristics. Both of  Ip and β are comparative larger 
for the passivated device. On the basis of the experimental results, we conclude that (i) 
the passivation-layer plays an important role in the DEHPT optical performance and (ii)
