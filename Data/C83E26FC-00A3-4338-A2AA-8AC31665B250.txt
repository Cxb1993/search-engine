4A. P/E Characteristics:
Fig. 1 shows the schematic band diagram
of SiO2/AlN/HfAlO/IrO2 devices. The strong
trapping AlN can reduce the P/E voltage even
for thin AlN. The 5.1eV high workfunction [6]
is important to scale down the HfAlO
thickness and erase voltage. This is evidenced
from the 1 order of magnitude lower Jg in Fig.
2 than a previous report of a similar structure
[3] also under -10 to -15V erase. This is
consistent with the >10X lower Jg in
IrO2/high-pMOS than mid-gap metal-gate
device [6]. The C-V hysteresis curves, in
Fig.3, show very large ΔVth shifts of 7-10V.
The capacitance further increases to 3.5
fF/um2 for 12nm AlN MONOS to give large
charge storage at low voltage. The detailed
P/E characteristics from Id-Vg are shown in
Figs. 4-5 for thicker 16nm AlN MONOS. A
fast P/E time of 100us-1ms are measured at
±13V, with a large ΔVth shift. The ΔVth and
P/E speed are improved using the thinner
12nm AlN MONOS. As shown in Figs. 6-7,
the 13V 100us program gives 3.3V ΔVth
change and the -13V 100us erase has -3.7V
ΔVth. Even aΔVth shift of 2.1V and -1.8V is
obtained at 10us and ±13V P/E. Such very
fast erase is ~10X better than published data
[1]-[4] with larger ΔVth. It arises from the
higher electric field in thin 2.8nm SiO2 due to
a smaller voltage drop in small EOT high-
HfAlO (=17) barrier and trapping AlN (=10)
from0E continuity. The high work-function
IrO2 gate [6] also helps the erase by largely
reducing charge injection from gate with thin
HfAlO.
B. Retention & Cycling:
Figs. 8-10 show the retention data. The
10-year retention ΔVth is larger for 12nm than 
and 16nm AlN devices with only slightly
faster decay rate. The extrapolated 10-year
memory window at 25oC for 12nm AlN
device, increases from 2.4 to 4.1V with
increasing erase time from 0.1 to 1ms. Still a
large 10-year window at 85oC of 1.9 or 3.4V
was obtained for 100us or 1ms erase and
100us program at ±13V. This is above the
best reported data [1]-[4] in Table 1. Besides,
the 85oC highand low-level retention decay
rate of 120 and only 64mV/dec are
comparable with published data [1]-[4], with
added merit of the largest initialΔVth of 5.5V
(3.7V) at 1ms (0.1ms) -13V erase. This large
memory window arises form the strong Al-N
ionic bond to give better trapping capability
than Al2O3 and Si3N4. Good endurance is also
obtained in Figs. 11-12. At 85oC and ±13V,
big 105-cycled memory window of 2.9 or
4.6V and 10k-cycled 10-year retention
window of 1.6 or 2.7V are obtained at 0.1ms
or 1ms erase. Such excellent endurance is due
to the fast P/E time with less stress to tunnel
SiO2. Table 1 summarizes the important
memory data. At 85oC and ±13V P/E, good
memory integrity of fast 100 to 1000us erase
time, large ΔVth of 3.7 or 5.5V, big
105-cycled ΔVth of 2.9 or 4.6V, and good
retention of large 10-year memory window of
1.9 or 3.4V are obtained at the same time in
this MONOS device.
四、結論
Fast erase, large ΔVth, good retention
and cycling are simultaneously obtained in
SiO2/AlN/HfAlO/IrO2 devices.
