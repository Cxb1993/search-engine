improve image quality. Experimental results prove that the proposed 
MPG-EDBTC provides excellent image quality, robustness, and 
embedded capacity. 
The rest of this report is organized as follows. Section 2 
introduces the performance evaluation approaches used in this study. 
Section 3 describes the traditional BTC. The proposed MPG-EDBTC 
is presented in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes the experimental 
results, and conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 
2. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS 
In this section, the performance evaluation approaches, PSNR and 
Correct Decoding Rate (CDR), employed in this work are defined. 
For an image of size P ൈ Q, the quality evaluation of an images is 
defined as

where h୧,୨  denotes the original grayscale host image; wh୧,୨  denotes 
the watermarked host image; g୫,୬  denotes a Gaussian filter for 
simulating the lowpass characteristic of human visual system (HVS), 
and R  denotes the support region of this filter. In this work, the 
standard deviation of the Gaussian filter is 1.3, and R is fixed at 7x7. 
In general, the greater the PSNR, the better image quality will be. 
The other performance evaluation is the Correct Decode Rate 
(CDR), which determines the similarity between the original 
watermark and the corresponding decoded watermark. Suppose the 
watermark is of size M ൈ N,

where w୧,୨ୢ  and w୧,୨  denote the decoded watermark and the original 
watermark, respectively. The notation Θ denotes XNOR operation. 
In general, the greater the CDR, the better the decoded result will be. 
3. OVERVIEW OF THE TRADITIONAL BLOCK TRUNCATION CODING 
Standard BTC is easy to implement. The original image is divided 
into many non-overlapped blocks, each of which is of size M ൈ N. 
Each block can be processed independently. To begin with, the first-
moment, second-moment, and the corresponding variance are 
obtained as

where h୧,୨  denotes the grayscale value in a block. Since BTC is a 
one-bit quantizer, a threshold hത  is employed to binarize the block. 
The block is then replaced by its high mean and low mean as below,

where a and b denote low mean and high mean, respectively. The 
concept of BTC is to preserve the first- and second- moments of a 
block when the original value is substituted by its high or low means. 
Thus, the following two equations should be maintained:

4. MAJORITY-PARITY-GUIDED ERROR-DIFFUSED BLOCK 
TRUNCATION CODING 
The proposed watermarking is introduced in this section. Figure 1 
shows its system architecture. For simplicity, the selected 
watermarks are of identical size, each of which is permutated with a 
pseudo-random key to improve security and withstand some types of 
attacks. In the rest of this section, the two functional blocks, encoder 
and decoder of MPG-EDBTC, are fully discussed. 
 
4.1 MPG-EDBTC Encoder 
According to Fig. 1, two inputs, including host image and K 
watermarks, are directed to the MPG-EDBTC encoder. Figure 2 
shows the fundamental embedding concept. Let the host image and 
watermark be of sizes P ൈ Q and M ൈ N, respectively. A watermark 
is generally in binary fashion. As indicated, the host image is divided 
into many non-overlapped blocks, and the number of blocks is equal 
to the number of watermark pixels, meaning that a watermark bit is 
embedded in a block. The processing order is in raster scan path, 
which means from left to right and top to bottom. Figure 3 illustrates 
the processing algorithm. In Fig. 3(a), h୧,୨  denotes the grayscale 
value of the host image at the current processing position ሺi, jሻ, hԢ୧,୨ 
denotes the diffused error sum added up from the neighboring 
processed pixels, v୧,୨  denotes the modified input value, and wh୧,୨ 
denotes the binary results by thresholding from v୧,୨ . The binary 
thresholded result is replaced by either maximum or minimum 
values in the current block, and the threshold exploits the mean of 
the current block. Error kernel is employed to diffuse the error 
caused by the difference e୧,୨. Three well-known error kernels, Floyd 
[9], Jarvis et al., [10], and Stucki [11], are shown in Fig. 4, where the 
notation x denotes the current processing position. The relationship 
between these variables are organized as,

,                            ሺ12ሻ 
where hത, h୫୧୬, and h୫ୟ୶ denote the mean, minimum, and maximum 
values, repectively of the current processed block. The variable ε is 
an additive value for controlling the result of wh୧,୨, which will be 
discussed later. Comparing with Eq. 6, the high mean and low mean 
are replaced by the local maximum and minimum values. 
Consequently, the complexity can be significantly reduced by saving 
the effort in calculating the variance used in high and low means. 
Moreover, the image quality can be improved by diffusing the 
quantized error into the neighboring pixels. Notably, the error in the 
boundary pixels of a block should also diffuse to its neighboring 
blocks to eliminate the blocking effect.  
 A watermark bit is embedded by controlling the parity 
value in a divided block of the EDBTC image. The parity value is 
evaluated from the number of pixels with minimum values in a 
Parity-Check Region (PCR) as defined below, 
݌ݒ௜,௝ ൌ ൥ ෍ ෍ ൜

൩ ݉݋݀ 2.                        ሺ13ሻ 
Notably, the calculating area excludes the current processing 
position (i,j). The additive value ε  as given in Eqs. 11-12 is 
employed to control parity of the current position (i,j) in order to 
comply with the expected value. An example is shown in Fig. 3(b), 
of watermarks to achieve acceptable image quality (around 
PSNR=40 dB) and high CDR. According to Fig. 11, the 
recommended N୧  for each number of watermarks is organized in 
Table I. For the extremely high-capacity case of embedding 10 
watermarks, it still obtains CDR=89.59%.  Figure 12 shows the 
watermarked images and the corresponding decoded watermarks 
using the recommended N୧  from Table I when even numbers of 
watermarks are embedded. Figure 12(a) shows the 10 employed 
watermarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can 
achieve good image quality and decoded rate under huge embedding 
capacity.  
 Figure 13 shows comparisons of image quality between 
traditional BTC and the proposed MPG-EDBTC. For a fair 
comparison, the parameter N୧ is set at zero. As can be seen, the 
proposed MPG-EDBTC is superior to traditional BTC in dealing 
with configurations of different block sizes. 
 So far, there have been few former approaches addressing 
the issue of embedding watermarks in BTC images. In Tu-Hsu’s 
method [22], the watermark embedding is independent of BTC 
image generation. Hence, the image quality of the obtained 
watermarked image is identical to that of the original BTC image, 
while an overhead of the same size as the watermark should be 
transmitted as an overhead. For practical usage, Tu-Hsu’s method is 
different from the proposed MPG-EDBTC, and the comparison is 
thus made with Lin-Chang’s mehod only [23]. Figures 14-16 show 
the comparison of performance between Lin-Chang’s watermarking 
[23] and the proposed MPG-EDBTC. The sizes of a host image, 
watermark, and block are 512x512, 64x64, and 8x8, respectively. 
Lin-Chang’s method employs different embedding targets to increase 
capacity, such as different bit-planes of low mean and high mean 
(the definition is the same as that of traditional BTC), and bitmap. 
Figure 14 shows the comparison of image quality when different 
numbers of watermarks are embedded, where the parameters 
addressed in Table I are employed for the proposed method, and the 
PSNRs are thus always around 40 dB. Regarding the comparison of 
robustness, many types of attacks are tested, including lightening, 
darkening, pulse noising, Gaussian noising, Gaussian smoothing, 
down-sampling, jittering, cropping, JPEG, and JPEG2000. Figure 15 
shows the corresponding experimental results. As can be seen, the 
robustness of the proposed method is superior to that of Lin-Chang’s 
method for six types of attacks, including darkening, pulse noising, 
Gaussian noising, Gaussian smoothing, jittering, and JPEG 
compression. Two types of attacks have similar performance, 
including down-sampling and cropping, and inferior to their method 
by two types of attacks, including lightening and JPEG2000 
compression. In summary, for those attacks that affect significantly 
the distributions of local maximum and minimum value positions or 
reduce the relative difference between local values, the proposed 
watermarking cannot guarantee good decoded results. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
Nowadays, most images are compressed before they are transmitted 
or stored, and thus watermarking is highly suggested to be catered 
into compressed domain of an image. In this work, a high-capacity 
watermarking technique for Block Truncation Coding (BTC) images 
is proposed. This technique improves image quality of traditional 
BTC for configurations of high coding gain, where the energy-
preserving property of EDF is exploited to effectively remove the 
blocking effect inherent in BTC images. Moreover, the efficiency 
can also be improved by replacing the high mean and low mean with 
the maximum and minimum values in a block. When watermarks are 
embedded, the proposed Majority-Parity-Guided Error-Diffused 
BTC (MPG-EDBTC) can achieve good image quality and decoded 
rates under a huge embedded capacity. The robustness of the 
proposed method is superior to that of Lin-Chang’s method for many 
types of attacks, and thus proves that the proposed watermarking is 
effective in addressing the security issues in compressed images.

1. J. M. Guo*, “Error-diffused image security improving using overall 
minimal-error searching,” Pacific-Rim Symposium on Image and Video 
Technology, Tokyo, Japan, January 13-16, 2009. (NSC

一、參加會議經過 
PSIVT 2009 為影像及視處理方面近年來主辦得相當不錯的研究會，本研討會提供了
非常多影像處理方面的交流技術平台，本次參加研究討除了參與本身發表論文的場次
外，也參加了許多其他個人有興趣的主題，除了吸收最新發展技術外，也結識許多國際
上知名的學者，對於未來的國際合作奠立了基礎，並且也藉由參與本研討會讓國際上的
學者瞭解台灣在這方面的技術發展，也間接提升少許的國際知名度。 
 
 
二、與會心得 
本次參與 PSIVT 2009 研討會裏面不乏有些人所帶領的團隊在這個領域已有多年的
經驗，而且也有相當不錯的成果，本人也與這些學者有技術上的交流，但關鍵的技術問
題，仍有待回國後慢慢消化。本次大會安排的 plenary 非常有水準，主要是介紹有關 video 
synopsis 相關的研究，將時間軸上的資訊壓縮至空間域上，在不損失資訊量的情況下大
幅地降低資料量，非常具有啟發性。大體而言，這次的研討會參與相當重要，不僅瞭解
國際上的學者在這個議題上的態度與發展，也得到了不少新的啟發。
