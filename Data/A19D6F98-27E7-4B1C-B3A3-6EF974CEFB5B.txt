Fig. 4. Framework of circuit design and manufacturing 
optimization for fab-wide APC 
 
Design of experiments (DOE) is to plan the experiment 
so that appropriate data will be collected to discover the 
relationship between input variables xi and response y. Using 
the collected experimental data, an empirical model y = f (x1, 
x2,…, xk ) + ε, which is also called response surface model, 
can be constructed to describe the input-output relationship. 
The term ε represents the usual random error. In general, a 
lower polynomial function over the experimental region such 
as a first-order model can be employed. If significantly 
curvature exists and the first-order model is not adequate, and 
a second-order response surface model should be considered. 
A sequential procedure of the modeling and analysis of 
response surface using empirical models is called response 
surface methodology (RSM) [1] - [3]. 
 
2. Methodology 
Using RSM, engineers want to analyze the data and 
figure out the relations between input variables and the 
output response through appropriate experiments. For 
example, in semiconductor design for manufacturability 
(DFM), Wafer Acceptance Tests (WAT), also called Electrical 
Tests (ET), are the output responses while the geometric 
layout design factors such as the channel width (W) and the 
distance from the polysilicon to the active area (E1) of a 
semiconductor device in Fig 5, are the input variables. 
 
Fig. 5. Example of layout design factors 
The ET data are the electrical measurements of the 
circuit such as the electric current and the voltage. The input 
variables of the ET could be the channel width or the channel 
length in different design structures. DOEs, such as central 
composite designs (CCD) and D-optimum designs [4], are 
used to determine the setting of these input variables in the 
experiments. These efficient experimental designs can help 
us to build a reliable response surface model with minimum 
number of experimental runs. 
After obtaining experiment results, we can build a 
quadratic response surface model for each output response. 
These models provide an empirical relation between input 
variables and the circuit electrical signals. In practice, it is 
not unusual that more than one output response is required to 
conform to engineering specifications. For example, there are 
usually many ET items of concern to the engineers in the 
DFM problems. Engineers would like to obtain an optimum 
setting for each controllable or designable input variable so 
that different specifications of the electrical signals are met. 
The multiple responses optimization problem is like to 
find a joint root to satisfy a set of quadratic response surface 
equations. There are two possibilities. One is that the joint 
root exists. The other one is that there is no adequate root. 
The second possibility is more often seen in the 
semiconductor DFM problem because the number of design 
factor is much fewer than the number of ET parameters of 
interest. 
To formulate the problem, let there be m parameters of 
the design structures, the estimated quadratic response 
surface model for the ith response, denote as iyˆ  , can be 
written as

Fig. 6. Two SPICE models with rounding phenomenon 
 
The L represents the channel drawn length, and the W 
represents the channel drawn width. The rounding 
phenomenon would make L → L+∆L and W → W+∆W. The 
change in L and W directly influence 
L
W
, which represents 
the width-to-length ration of a transistor. The saturation 
current (IDsat) and the threshold voltage (Vt) would be 
proportional to the 
L
W
 [6] [7]. Both of IDsat and Vt are the 
major observations in ET. The design house would like to 
obtain a setting of the design layout which has less variation 
and close to the desired electrical performances. 
In our case study, the design factors on the device 
layout are shown in Fig 7 and the upper bound and lower 
bound of these factors are summarized as Table 1. This 
design is a NMOS transistor and the rounding phenomenon 
occurs around the fillister in the center of Active-Area.

It is a 3-factor layout design problem. 10 ET 
parameters are measured in a CCD experiment and 10 
response surface models are built. Because the rounding 
phenomenon would be influenced by H1 and E1, the design 
rule would like the H1 to be as large as possible and the E1 to 
be as small as possible. Thus, the 
term, ( ) ( )22 05.014.01 −+− EH , are added into our objective 
function to ensure the design factors close to the targets. We 
also added the following constraints for H1 and E1:  
 
1.0105.0
4.012.0
≤≤
≤≤
E
H
. 
 
In addition, the designers are asked to minimize the 
rounding effect caused by the design factors E1 and H1. That 
is, they hope that changes in E1 and H1 should not have 
minimum influence on the responses. Therefore, additional 
terms of 2,1,0

function. 
Each of the 10 ET has a specification window and a 
desired target. We generate the desired targets close to the 
responses corresponding to the setting of (0.4, 0.05, 0.25). 
Furthermore, the specification limits are generated by ±10% 
of these responses. These requirements are summarized as in 
the Table 2.
