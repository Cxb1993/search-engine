Abstract 
Managers in private and public sectors frequently need to allocate a given bonus 
to the units under his/her governance according to their multiple performance indices. 
Bonus allocation usually is difficult and troublesome since one needs to detect outliers 
on equal terms for avoiding units with special performances to affect the evaluation of 
other units. On the other hand, one has to determine a set of common weights to 
aggregate the performance indices. This paper introduces analytical procedure with 
two phases that based on mathematical programming under the perspective of an 
enterprise. It is designed to help managers adjusting the bonus range of most 
employees to a desired level. The model that we proposed is flexible so that the 
manager can easily adjust the parameters to satisfy his managerial requirements under 
effective labor cost management.      
Keywords: performance evaluation, bonus allocation, common weights, multiple 
indices 
1. Introduction 
Besides the base payment, many private and public sectors usually allocate a 
certain amount of bonus to stimulate employee’s morale. The adjustments of one’s 
base payment are usually accorded with the seniority and performance of that 
employee, normally, the base payment gradually increases rather than decreases, 
therefore this issue will not be further discussed in this paper. However, we 
concentrate on a more important issue - bonus allocation. A well-established bonus 
allocation system will not only stimulate employee’s morale but also raise the 
company’s profits, and significantly reduce employee’s leaving rate.

order to control the bonuses acquired by most units and to satisfy the total bonus 
budget’s limits. Our model may identify and cope with outliers without affecting 
other units’ performance score. 
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: related literatures are presented in 
Section 2. The two-phase analytical procedure is explicitly described in Section 3. 
Numerical example is used to interpret our procedure in Section 4. Conclusions are 
made and further researches are suggested in Section 5. 
  
2. Literature review 
Performance evaluation has always been an important issue in industries. 
Moreover, the most commonly used methods of performance evaluation in industries 
are DEA, AHP and BSC; they are explicitly introduced in 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 
respectively. Other related papers are reviewed in 2.4.  
2.1 DEA 
DEA, one of the most popular tools in production management literature for 
performance measurement, uses the idea of envelopment to define a production 
frontier and to differentiate between efficient Decision-Making Units (DMUs) and 
inefficient ones. The first and most famous model, CCR (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 
1978), employs the techniques of liner programming to search for the best outcomes 
in all circumstances. Each DMU selects the most favorable weights to maximize its 
performance score, under the constraint of all DMU’s performance score may not 
exceed 1 when calculated by this set of weights. However, in this paper we employ 
common weights to evaluate performances, thus, DMUs are renamed Units of 
assessment ( UOAs). Basic notations are as follows: 
hk : the related performance score of DMUk 
DMUj : the jth Decision-Making Unit. 
yrj (xij): the rth output (ith input) of DMUj 
ur (vi ):the corresponding weight of output r (input i) 
: a positive non-Archimedean infinitesimal 
CCR-input oriented 
max

suited to individual and group decision-making due to its role as a synthesizing 
mechanism. Consensus refers to the agreement amongst group participants in 
constructing a hierarchy and making judgments. If a consensus cannot be reached, the 
group may then choose to vote or compromise on a judgment. If a consensus cannot 
be achieved and the group is unwilling to vote or to compromise, then the geometric 
mean (average) of the individuals’ judgments can be calculated. If the members of the 
group have significantly different objectives and cannot meet to discuss the decision, 
then each group member can make a judgment separately, based on separate models 
or players. 
This method relies on the subjective determination of the manager; therefore he 
may obtain the desired weights. However, AHP does not have an inherent mechanism 
to limit total bonuses allocated; therefore AHP cannot effectively control labor costs 
directly.   
2.3 Balanced scorecard 
The balanced scorecard is a strategic planning and management system, which is 
used extensively in business, government, and nonprofit organizations worldwide to 
align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve 
internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against 
strategic goals. Kaplan and Norton (1993) originated it as a performance measurement 
framework that added strategic non-financial performance measures to traditional 
financial metrics to give managers and executives a more 'balanced' view of 
organizational performance. The balanced scorecard suggests that we view the 
organization from four perspectives: the learning and growth, the business process, 
the customer, and the financial. Kaplan & Norton (1996) indicates that employee’s 
behaviors will have a critical impact when bonus system is integrated with other 
fundamental elements in the company.   
 
2.4 Other related papers 
Nisar (2006) suggests that if bonuses and performances were linked directly, the 
company will gain advantages. Moreover, the indices used in performance evaluation 
must conform to the company’s long-term strategy. The paper also indicates that 
profits alone cannot be the only index used.    
Connors (2004) focuses on the effects between non-financial indices and bonus 
contracts. The paper employs questionnaires and statics to analyze if employee’s 
behaviors are affected by adding non-financial indices in contracts.

and m input indices. We use yrj and xij to denote the value of the rth output index and 
ith input index collected. Stage (P1.2) normalizes the data obtained above to eliminate 
the units used among indices; each value is between 0 and 1(it will be explicitly 
discussed later in this paper). Stage (P1.3) establish the upper and lower limit of the 
total bonus budget as CU and CL. (P1.4) set up the parameters required in (M1) 
according to managerial needs. Then, stage (P1.5) carries all of the parameters and 
data into (M1) for calculation. (M1) searches a set of Ur and Vi, which will minimize 
the difference between the highest and lowest performance score among all UOAs. 
The highest and lowest performance score of the initial solution are stated as A0, B0. 
A0 to B0 is the range of all DMUs’ performance score, if it can be accepted by the 
manager, then, allocate bonus premiums in stage (P2.4); if the manager has a more 
condensed limits in mind, then, we introduce stage (P2.1) to fine tune. 
	   10	  
the situations mentioning above occurred, we let (At+ Δ, Bt+ Δ) = (At+1, Bt+1) and (At
≒Δ, Bt≒Δ) = (At+1, Bt+1) be carried respectively into (M2) to re-calculate (other 
parameters remain unchanged). We allocate bonuses, if and only if the differences 
among UOAs’ performance scores and the amount used for bonuses are both 
conformed to the manager’s requirements.  
3.2 Notations 
 Before introducing our model, we first interpret the basic notations as follows: 
P「The bonus premium obtained for a unit value of performance score 
 and : The lower and upper bound in the γth type weight restriction of inputs 
 and : The lower and upper bound in the φth type weight restrictions of outputs 
γ: Denotes how many types of weight restrictions are placed on inputs γ = 0, 1,..., 2m 
(at most 2m types. γ = 0 indicates no weight restrictions have been placed on 
inputs) 
φ: Denotes how many types of weight restrictions are placed on outputs φ = 1, 2,..., 2m 
(at most 2m types. φ = 0 indicates no weight restrictions have been placed on 
outputs) 
αiγ: A binary variable, which indicates if the ith input index is considered in the γth type 
weight restriction of inputs. 
βrφ: A binary variable, which indicates if the rth output index is considered in the φth 
type weight restriction of outputs. 
 
k I: The minimum importance ratio between the weight of each input index and the 
sum of weights of the entire input indices. 
kO: The minimum importance ratio between the weight of each output index and the 
sum of weights of the entire output indices. 
: Any positive value (the value of which will not affect the optimal solution since 
the data have been normalized)

indices. is the lower bound and is the upper bound. (1.5) is the general 
form, only upper or lower bound alone may be required.  
For example: There are 3 input indices, the corresponding weights are V1, V2 and 
V3. We assume that the manager needs the ratio between the sum of V1 and V2, and 
the sum of all corresponding weights (inputs) between 0.3 and 0.6. And also needs 
the ratio between V1 and the sum of all corresponding weights (inputs) between 0.2 
and 0.4. As follows: 
 
We have 2 types of input weight restrictions︽thus =2. The general form is as 
follows:  
  
Transform into corresponding values「 
 
Moreover, we proposed a concept that the ratios between the weight of each 
input index and the sum of weights of the entire input indices must have at least a 
minimum value, otherwise this index shouldn’t be considered during performance 
evaluation. The concept mentioned above is the same as output indices (1.7) and 
(1,8). 
Readers may be confused about the values of KI and KO, because the units which 
used in each index may be inconsistent, constraint (1.5), (1.6), (1.7) and (1.8) will be 
inappropriate. Thus, we first normalize the collected data to eliminate variations 
among the units which used in each index before the calculations in M1. In this paper, 
we normalize data by dividing all the values by the maximum value of the 
corresponding index, so each value is between 0 and 1. An example is shown later in 
this paper.  
We may obtain the initial solution Ao and Bo by solving (M1), the range of the 
initial solution is the minimum which includes each UOA’s performance score. 
However, the initial solution and the differences among UOA’s performance score are 
usually too extensive, thus we employ (M2) to fine-tune.

 We may see that most UOA’s performance score will fall into the range; 
however some UOA’s performance score are forced to be outside the range as the 
range decreases. We classify these outliers into two types, efficient outliers and 
inefficient outliers. The reason that we allow the occurrence of outliers is to prevent 
outliers’ performance scores affect other’s as well as to detect outliers. Moreover, the 
reader must understand that the slope between each dot and the origin is the

We normalize the above data by dividing all the values by the maximum value

We assume V1, the corresponding weight of input index x1, must account for at 
least 50% of the sum of all corresponding weights (input). Moreover, the weight of 
each input index must account for at least 10% of the sum of all corresponding 
weights (input). The same is with output. The parameters of (M1) are as follows: 
CL「500 (104), CU「600 (104), P「20 (104), 「0.5, KI「0.1, KO「0.1. The results

 We assume that the manager considers the initial solution too extensive, causing 
major differences among UOA’s performance score and leading to low morale. Thus, 
we employ Phase two to fine-tune. In Phase two, we use (1.35, 0.75), obtained by 
Phase one, as our initial range. Then, we let (At – 0.05, Bt +0.05) = (At+1, Bt+1) to 
narrow the range gradually and to limit the differences among UOA’s score within the 
range. The results are as Table 6:

1. Introduction 
In usual life, there are a lot of decision problems about ranking, choosing, and 
rewarding. For example, how to select the best staff to reward is often a revealed issue 
in a company. It is common for a company to form a decision-making group that 
consists of managers and professionals to rank the candidates. At first, each 
decision-maker ranks the candidate according to her/his preference. One may employ 
the linear programming model proposed by Cook and Kress (CK) (1990) to 
distinguish between consecutive rank places and consecutive criteria to the greatest 
extent possible. They prosed to maximize the gap among consecutive weights of the 
scoring. The aggregate scores of candidates are computed by the obtained common 
set of weights. However, using the aggregate scores to rank often causes several 
candidates to be indiscriminate when there are tied candidates with the same score. 
Llamazares and Peña (2009) reviewed several methods proposed in the literature to 
discriminate efficient candidates and showed some drawbacks of these methods. They 
mentioned that none of the proposed procedures are fully convincing. 
In employing the CK model, the evaluated candidates can be ranked by their 
aggregate scores. Usually, there are candidates who are tied across several ranks. In 
this research, we introduce a two-phase mathematical model to discriminate 
candidates who were tied in the same rank. The purpose of this research is not only to 
rank the candidates who are not tied but also to disperse their aggregate scores in a 
manner that yields no ties. With the amended common set of weights, the candidates 
are ranked according to the revised aggregate scores. 
Section 2 of this paper gives a literature review. In section 3, the mathematical 
programming models for discriminating tied candidates are introduced. A numerical 
example is illustrated in section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper. 
	   26	  
system. They set up criteria to evaluate the m suppliers (candidates) such as flexibility, 
quality, cost, and delivery (Liu and Hai, 2005). For each criterion, the decision group 
may vote for the best k candidates. In general, k is no more than m. When k = m, we 
call this situation full ranking. 
In Borda’s rule the decision makers rank all m candidates. Let  denotes the 
total number of votes that candidate i received at the jth place and  is the weight 
attached to jth place. Here, . The score obtained by candidate i is : 
 (1) 
Candidates are ranked according to their scores (Borda, 1781). The decision makers 
may simply choose the best k candidates from the m candidates. 
2.2.  CK model and subsequent research 
Determination of the set of weights, w1, w2,…, wk is a critical issue to compute 
their aggregate scores. According to the idea of judging the value of weights, 
decreasing the sequence of weights, and not increasing the difference of weights, we 
can obtain a common set of weights for full ranking. Cook and Kress (1990) proposed 
a procedure to rank candidates in a preferential election by DEA. In the DEA 
literature, candidates under assessment are named decision-making units (DMUs). 
Candidate io’s relative efficiency against m DMUs with regards to a particular object 
is evaluated with a set of most favourable weights. Each candidate takes a turn acting 
as the object. Therefore, the following CK model is executed m times: 
	   28	  
robustness in terms of the range of . In the CK model, maximum discrimination 
between the candidates is sought, in which case, the weights used to evaluate and rank 
the candidates are treated as if imposed externally at the outset. Substitute , j = 
1,…, k to equation (1) to compute the aggregate score of candidate i, . 
Cook and Kress (1991; 1994), and Cook et al. (1993; 1996) gave a subjective 
ordinal preference ranking according to DEA models. They developed a common set 
of weights through a series of bounded DEA ran by closing the gap between the upper 
and lower weight limits. The upper and lower bounds were determined subjectively in 
those models. 
Green et al. (1996) proposed a cross-evaluation method, in which the 
candidates are self and peer evaluated, and selected all  equal to zero. The 
average across self and peer evaluations represents a DMU’s cross efficiency value. 
Hashimoto (1997) considered a ranked voting system using a DEA/AR 
exclusion model. As depicted in the following model, four sets of constraints were 
used to determine the set of most favourable weights for achieving the highest 
possible aggregate scores for candidate io. The additional third set of constraints 
ensured the differences in weights were non-increasing. The last constraint enforced 
the weight to be assigned to the last place, wk, no less than . The m candidates took 
turns as io and may have different sets of weights. 
 
(4) 
Cook and Zhu (2006) developed a general framework for modelling and 
	   30	  
was the one with the biggest aggregate number of votes. However, there were 
disadvantages when the l1-norm was used. 
3. Discriminating models for selecting superiors 
One may employ the CK model to find a common set of weights to obtain the 
aggregate scores for the m candidates. The first step is to reorder the candidates 
according to their aggregate scores so that ≥ ≥…≥ . Some candidates 
have the same aggregate scores in several ranks or classes. Restated, there are several 
classes, and some of them may contain more than one candidate with the same 
score(s). In the second steps, for those classes in which ties appeared, a two-phase 
mathematical model is used to discriminate the candidates. In this section, we first 
introduce the two- phase mathematical model for each class. Those candidates’ 
aggregate scores can be re-determined. Thereupon, the superior of each class is 
presented. 
3.1. Step 1: Employing the CK model to classify the whole candidates 
There are m candidates, and the decision group votes for k places. Employing 
the CK model, model (3) of the current paper, with . The optimal solution 
of the model are the common set of weights of the places for the entire DMUs, , j 
= 1, 2,…, k. Employ equation (1) to obtain the aggregate scores , i = 1,…, m. 
The candidates are then ranked according to their aggregate scores. Let P’ denotes the 
total number of classes in the ranking. Each class may contain multiple candidates 
that have same aggregate score.  
3.2. Step 2: Discriminating the tied candidates in class P 
In the current paper, we focus the particular situation that exactly top G 
candidates should be selected and the G-th candidate belongs the P-th class that 
	   32

 (5.2) 
 (5.3) 
 
Phase two: adjust the weights 
Given the obtained maximum value  of model (5), we look for another 
common set of weights  (j = 1, 2,…, k) to differentiate between the candidates in 
set . As shown on the right-hand side of Figure 1, the last weight  is  
above the ground level, while the other (k – 1) weights,  (j = 1, 2,…, k – 1), weigh 
 plus . The strategy is to reduce the weight of the last place and increase the 
weights of the remaining places. The objective is to search the maximum  and to 
show that all of the candidates in set  have aggregate scores no more than the 
upper limit of one.

listed in order of decreasing number of first places won. If there is a tie, i.e., plural 
candidates win the same number of first places, their respective numbers of second 
places are counted, and the one with the larger number of second places becomes the 
winner of this tie. This ranking system faces some relative difficulty in obtaining a 
superior place for choosing the superior candidate when certain candidates have the 
same aggregate score by the CK model.

A company needs to select two best staffs out of the five candidates A, B, C, 
D, and E. The voting results from the 30 managers of the company are depicted in 
column (a) of Table 1 (m = 5, k = 2, G = 2). Columns (b) and (c) respectively are the 
results that obtained according to step 1 and step 2 of the current paper.

line constraints (B), (C), , and . When = 0.0526, the feasible region is 
formed by an only point S. So the optimal solution is  = 0.0526. 
 
Figure 3 Feasible weight space for = 0.0526 in model (8) 
Then, employ [Ph-2] to configure model (9). If we incorporate  = 0 into 
model (9), then the intersection of the constraints  and  is the single point T 
shown in Figure 4.

In Table 2, it is clearly that from (8) to (9), the last weight is decreased from 
0.0526 to 0.0388, whereas the first place is increased from 0.1053 to 0.1302.

5. Conclusion 
Reaching a group decision through voting is widely applied in daily practices 
such as elections, social choices, performance ranking, and aggregating expert 
decisions into a single judgment continues to be an important subject in the field of 
decision science. In previous studies, there have been many approaches for ordering 
candidates in a preferential election (Cook and Kress, 1990; Green et al., 1996; 
Hashimoto, 1997). Our research combines Cook and Kress’ model with two novel 
modifications: decreasing the sequence of weights and the introducing the concept of 
common weights, both of which satisfy current decision science needs. 
We propose the two-phase mathematical model to discriminate candidates 
with the same aggregate score obtained from the CK model. We loosen their 
restrictions on the weights and design a less stringent common set of weights for 
computing newly amended aggregate scores. It is reasonable that the superior position 
of votes is more important for choosing the superior candidate when the original 
aggregate scores are the same. 
Multiple models can be employed to reach a compromise on decisions made 
by a group of voters. One can insert additional constraints to models (3), (5) and (6) to
