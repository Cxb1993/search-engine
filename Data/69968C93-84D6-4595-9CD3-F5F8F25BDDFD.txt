Abstract 
Human cystatin C (HCC), one of the amyloidgenic proteins, has been proved to form dimeric 
structure via domain swapping process and then cause amyloid deposits in the brains of 
patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. HCC monomer consists of a core with a 
five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β region) wrapped around a central helix. The connectivity 
of these secondary structures is: (N)-β1-α-β2-L1-β3-AS-β4-L2-β5-(C). In this study, various 
molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the conformational changes of 
the monomeric HCC at different temperatures (300 and 500K) and pHs (2, 4, and 7) to gain 
insight into the domain swapping mechanism. The results show that high temperature (500K) 
and low pH (pH 2) will trigger the domain swapping process of HCC. We further proposed 
that the domain swapping mechanism of HCC follows four steps: (1) the α-helix moves away 
from the β region; (2) the contacts between β2 and β3-AS disappear; (3) the β2-L1-β3 hairpin 
unfolds following the so-called “zip-up” mechanism; and (4) finally the HCC dimer is formed. 
Our study shows that high temperature can accelerate the unfolding of HCC and the departure 
of the α-helix from the β-region, especially at low pH value. It is attributed to that low pH 
results in the protonation of the side chains of Asp, Glu, and His residues, which further 
disrupts the following four salt-bridge interactions stabilizing the α-β interface of the native 
structure: Asp15-Arg53 (β1-β2), Glu21/20-Lys54 (helix-β2), Asp40-Arg70 (helix-AS), and 
His43-Asp81 (β2-AS).

inhibit domain swapping and their results suggest that the capacity of these two variants to 
form amyloid fibrils were reduced by 80% compared with that of wild-type HCC. To further 
explore the conditions for HCC to oligomerize, experiments of wild-type HCC at elevated 
temperature, low pH, or at conditions of mild chemical denaturation were performed and the 
results show that dimerization would occur under these conditions (13, 14). For example, 
Ekiel and Abrahamson have successfully demonstrated that the self-association of the 
wild-type HCC can be induced by high temperature, guanidine hydrochloride, and low pH 
(14). Furthermore, Gerhartz et al. have investigated the influence of pH on the dimmer 
formation of L68Q cystatin C and their results suggested that the dimerization results from 
lowing the pH conditions (15). However, during the early stages of amyloid formation, the 
atomic details of domain swapping mechanism of HCC are still poorly understood.  
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide more detailed information about 
structural change at atomistic level. Previous MD unfolding simulations have been reported 
for a monomeric protein, p13suc1, which forms a domain-swapped dimer (16). The results of 
p13suc1 study suggest that protein must undergo extensive unfolding before domain 
swapping can occur. Recently, Esposito and Daggett (17) have successfully investigated the 
domain swapping behaviors of ribonuclease A by MD unfolding simulations and the results 
show that high temperature and low pH would result in a possible initial conformation to 
induce domain swapping process (18, 19). In order to investigate the atomic details about the 
conformational changes of HCC responsible for the early stages of amyloid formation, 
various MD simulations at different temperatures (300 and 500K) and pHs (pH 2, 4, and 7) 
were conducted in the present study. These results may help us to gain insight into the domain 
swapping mechanism of HCC. 
 
2. Methods 
2.1 The construction of the monomeroc HCC model 
The model of the monomeric HCC used in our work is based on the known X-ray crystal 
structure of dimeric HCC (PDB: 1G96) (4, 5). The construction involved breaking the Ala58 
N-Cα bonds of the two units of dimeric HCC and joining the N atom from one open unit with 
the Cα atom from the second open unit via a new covalent bond. To mimic the experimental 
conditions that favor the formation of domain swapped dimmer, the pH conditions were set to 
pHs 2 (His residues were protonated and charged; and Asp and Glu residues were protonated 
and neural), 4 (His residues were protonated and charged; Asp residues were charged; and 
Glu residues were protonated and neural), and 7 (His residues were neural; and Asp and Glu 
residues were charged), which further determine whether the salt bridge interactions exist or 
not (the bold numbers given in Table 1) during the entire simulation time course. The 
ionization state of the these residues depends on the pKa of the side chain and the pH value 
given. The models of monomeric HCC with different ionization states of the charged residues 
(pHs 2, 4, and 7) were further refined by energy minimization.  
 6
physiologic conditions: temperature (24-31), pressure (32), pH (33), or solvent (34-36). At 
high temperature conditions (for example, 500 K), MD simulations have become a 
well-established tool to accelerate protein unfolding without changing the pathway of 
unfolding (18). As can be seen in Figure 2, the MD unfolding simulations carried out at 500 K 
at various pH values all show larger Cα rms deviations comparing to those at 300 K. Similar 
to the results of 300 K, the entire structure deviates from the starting structure more 
significantly at lower pH values at 500 K. The Cα rms deviations at various pH conditions all 
exhibit similar increasing trends, indicating a considerable degree of protein unfolding. At pH 
7, after around 2 ns, the Cα rms deviation reaches 7 Å rapidly and does not increase 
significantly anymore over the following 3 ns. As for the cases under acidic conditions (pHs 2 
and 4), higher Cα rms deviation values have been achieved, indicating that this protein 
undergoes a faster unfolding process. Among these simulations conducted in this study, the 
largest Cα rms deviation appears at 500K and pH 2, indicating that the monomeric HCC tends 
to undergo significant structural fluctuation under acidic and high temperature conditions, 
which may lead to domain swapping of this protein. 
To further illustrate the effects of high temperature and low pH on the structural 
fluctuation of the monomeric HCC, we further analyze the Cα rms fluctuation for each residue 
of this protein at 500K under various pH values and the results are shown in Figure 3. Similar 
to the simulations conducted at 300K, the larger backbone displacements also appear mostly 
in the N-terminal (Val10-Glu19), L1, AS loop, and L2 segments. However, the residues 
located in the secondary structural elements (α-helix and β-sheet) in the native protein exhibit 
higher fluctuations at 500K than at 300K under acidic conditions. For the N-terminal region, 
L1, and AS loop, the simulations at pH 2 at 500 K all show the largest Cα rms fluctuations 
comparing to the simulations conducted at pHs 4 and 7, with the smallest rms fluctuation 
appears at pH 7. These results further reinforce that the monomeric HCC at high temperature 
and low pH conditions tends to undergo severe structural changes, which may lead to domain 
swapping of this protein. The simulation results obtained from this study is consistent with the 
experimental results from the previous studies (5, 11). 
3.2 Analysis of the Contact maps of the monomeric HCC 
3.2.1 Simulations at 300 K 
Contact map analysis has been widely used to monitor the changes of the three 
dimensional structure and protein unfolding process at the atomistic level (37). In the contact 
map, the compactness of a protein structure is determined by measuring the distance of two 
non-adjacent Cα atoms. A “contact” is defined when the distance of two non-adjacent Cα 
atoms are less than 6.5 Å (38). The contacts within the native structure of a protein are thus 
defined as “native contacts”; whereas the newly formed contacts during the simulations are 
defined as “non-native contacts”. In this study, the frequencies of these contacts during the 
6-ns simulations are calculated for both 300 and 500 K at various pH conditions. In Figure 4, 
the native and non-native contacts of the monomeric HCC are shown above and below the 
 8
attributed to the fact that higher kinetic energy provided by higher temperature is potentially 
able to cause more severe structural fluctuations. The disappear of these important salt-bridge 
interactions may further induce protein unfolding, which may trigger the domain swapping 
process of this protein.  
3.3.1 The effects of salt bridges on the N-terminal segment and the helix 
There are two important salt-bridge interactions, Glu20-Lys54 and Glu21-Lys54, located 
between the N-terminal and β2 segments. At 500 K, the N-terminal segment exhibits 
significant structural fluctuation, especially at pHs 2 and 4 (see Figure 3). However, the 
N-terminal segment is more tightly linked to the helix at pH 7 than at acidic conditions (pHs 2 
and 4) because of the stabilizing effects of these two salt bridges. Under neutral condition at 
500 K, The salt-bridge distances of Glu20-Lys54 and Glu21-Lys54 are 9.3 ± 1.4 and 10.2 ± 
2.4 Å respectively, a little higher than those at 300 K (8.0 ± 1.3 and 8.9 ± 2.7 Å, respectively). 
On the contrary, in acidic conditions (pHs 2 and 4) at 500 K, the salt-bridge interactions of 
N-terminal segment-β2 are destroyed so that the distances of these donor/acceptor pairs 
increased significantly, leading to destabilizing the N-terminal segment and causing the helix 
to fluctuate more dramatically. 
Similarly, the salt bridge between β1 and β2 (Asp15-Arg53) also play an important role 
in stabilizing the N-terminal segment. At 300 K, the distances between Asp15 and Arg53 are 
9.7 ± 1.9 Å at pH 4 and 8.5 ± 1.1 Å at pH 7. Increasing temperature from 300 to 500 K only 
slightly increases the distances to 10.4 ± 1.3 (pH 4) and 9.5 ± 2.3 Å (pH 7). However, for the 
500 K simulation conducted at pH 2, the distance dramatically increase to 19.6 ± 5.4 Å due to 
the destruction of this salt-bridge induced by high temperature and acidic conditions.  
Another salt-bridge interaction is located between the helix and AS loop (Asp41-Arg70). 
At 300 K, the averaged distances of this salt-bridge pair are 7.6 ± 2.0 (pH 4) and 7.8 ± 1.3 Å 
(pH 7). For the 500 K simulations, the distances are slightly elevated to 9.9 ± 2.7 (pH 4) and 
10.1 ± 2.3 Å (pH 7). However, for the 500 K simulation conducted at pH 2, the salt bridge 
between Asp40 and Arg70 is destroyed and the distance between these two residues is 
increased to 17.78 ± 5.04 Å. Despite the three salt-bridges mentioned above, another salt 
bridge is observed between β2 and AS loop (His43-Asp81) in the native structure of the 
monomeric HCC. In most conditions of our simulations, this salt bridge maintains stable with 
no significant distance variation observed (Table 1). This salt bridge is broken only when the 
simulation is conducted under the condition of pH 2 at 500 K. The destruction of this salt 
bridge may cooperatively induce protein unfolding and accelerate the separation of β2 and AS 
loop (see Figure 4G). 
From the above analyses, we suggest that high temperatures significantly accelerate the 
unfolding of the monomeric HCC and that acidic conditions mainly destroy the salt bridges, 
which has been previously proven to play essential roles in the structural stability of this 
protein (11). As a result, the structural fluctuations induced by high temperatures and low pH 
values may lead to domain swapping of the monomeric HCC. The simulations conducted in 
 10
the previous study by Nilsson and coworkers (13), in which the disulfide bonds inserted 
between the helix and β5 (or β2 and β3) would decrease 80 % of domain swapping for HCC. 
That is, the enhanced stability of the helix in the monomeric HCC would inhibit the formation 
of dimmers, oligomers, and amyloid fibrils.  
 
4. Conclusions 
The mechanism of amyloid formation and its physiological roles have been widely 
investigated in recent years (43, 44, 45). The previous studies have demonstrated that domain 
swapping of some protein occurs under the conditions of high temperature and low pH (5, 17, 
45). In this study, we tried to observe the structural changes of the monomeric HCC at high 
temperature and low pH using MD simulations and to investigate the initial stage of the 
domain swapping process of this protein. From the analyses conducted in this study, we 
suggest a possible mechanism for the domain swapping of HCC as follows?(i) the helix 
departs from the β-region first (Figure 7 A→B); (ii) the native contacts within β2 and AS 
loop disappear (Figure 7 B→C); (iii) β-hairpin structure unfolds followed the so called 
“zip-up” mechanism (Figure 7 C→D); and (iv) the HCC open form is finally generated 
(Figure 7 E). Before β2 can move away from β3, the helix has to be separated from β-region 
first, indicating that it is the crucial step in the domain swapping process of HCC (10, 44). 
Our simulations reconfirm the results from the previous studies, where HCC at high 
temperature and low pH tends to dimerize or polymerize through domain swapping process 
(14) and provide an atomistic resolution of this process. Moreover, our results also show that 
high temperatures provide sufficient kinetic energy to accelerate protein unfolding and make 
the monomeric HCC structurally more dynamic, especially for the helix, which provides an 
initiation site for the domain swapping process to take place. Our results also indicate that the 
acidic conditions by lowering the pH values of the environment would disrupt some salt 
bridges within the monomeric HCC due to the protonation of some residues, such as Asp, Glu, 
and His. These important salt bridges have been shown to stabilize the monomeric HCC 
structure in two aspects: (i) Asp15-Arg53 and Glu21/20-Lys54 (located between the 
N-terminal segment and β2) and Asp40-Arg70 (located between the helix and AS loop) all 
play important roles in the reduction of the helix fluctuation; and (ii) His43-Asp81 reduces 
the structural fluctuation between β2 and AS loop. The results of this study further implicate 
that the monomeric HCC may become an open form conformation under high temperature 
and low pH conditions through a series of structural changes stated in Figure 7, which may 
further promote the formation of the dimeric HCC through the domain swapping process. The 
readers have to notice that the observations obtained from the present MD simulations were 
carried out in a single and short trajectory. These findings may also be found in two 
independent simulations of the same protein.
