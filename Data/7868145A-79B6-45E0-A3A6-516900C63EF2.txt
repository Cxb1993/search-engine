Abstract
In this study, performances of microscale heat sink
based on the modifications from the conventional
parallel channel heat sink (PCHS) are studied
experimentally. These modifications are intended to
enhance the heat transfer coefficient by the introduction
of flow disruption. By referring the walls that
separating the channels in PCHS as the plate fins, the
first type of modified heat sinks involves placing
obstacles alternatively on the plate fins. As a result, the
original parallel channels in PCHS become obstructive.
This type of heat sink is referred to as the obstructive
channel heat sink (OCHS). In the second type of heat
sink, the plate fins are cut into segments and arranged
in staggered form. This results in the plate fins in the
original parallel heat sink been modified to a staggered
arranged pin fin array and the heat sink is referred as
the pin fin heat sink (PFHS). Since the transverse fluid
flow in pin fin array is allowed, the PFHS is designed
to have two inlets and two outlets.
Based on the measurements of temperature
distributions on the heat sink base plates and pressure
drop across the heat sink, it is found that that the PFHS
can provide best temperature uniformity, lowest thermal
resistance and lowest pressure drop among the three
heat sink designs in this study.

1. Introduction
With the advancements of computing technology in
the past few decades, electronics have become faster,
smaller and more powerful. This results in an
ever-increasing heat generation rate from the electronic
devices. This observation can be seen in today’s 
personal computer developments. In most cases, the
chips are cooled through the use of forced air flow.
However, when dealing with component that contains
billions of transistors working at high frequency (of the
order of GHz), temperature can reach critical level
where standard cooling methods are not sufficient. In
addition to high-performance electronic chips, high heat
flux removal is also required in the devices such as
laser diode arrays and high-energy mirrors. In the last
two decades, many cooling technologies have been
pursued to meet the requirements of high heat
dissipation rate and keeping junction temperature low
enough. Among these efforts, microchannel heat sink
(MCHS) has been received much attention because of
its ability to produce high heat transfer coefficient,
small size and volume per heat load, and small coolant
requirements.
A MCHS typically contains a large number of
parallel microchannels with a hydraulic diameter
ranging from 10 to 1000μm. Coolant is forced to pass
through these channels to carry the heat away from a
hot surface. The cooling concept of MCHS was first
proposed for electronic cooling by Tuckerman and
Pease [1]. Since then, MCHS performances with
different substrate materials and channel dimensions
have been studied extensively in the past two decades.
These studies can be categorized into theoretical [2-5],
numerical [6-9], and experimental approaches [10-14].
Experimental approach serves as the most direct way to
understand the performance of the MCHS performance.
Recent excellent reviews on the experimental studies in
MCHS are provided by Kandlikar [15], Hassan et al.
[16] and Garimella and Sobhan [17]. Typical
fabrication technologies for producing microscale heat
sinks can be found in the review paper provided by
Kandlikar and Grande [18].
In the past, most of the MCHS are designed to
consist of a number of parallel channels having
rectangular, triangular or trapezoidal cross section. By
viewing the walls separating the channels as the plate
fins, MCHS can be regarded as the plate-fin heat sink
differential pressure transducer along with T-type
thermocouples were connected at the inlet and outlet of
the microchannel test module to measure the pressure
drop and temperature difference of the fluid as it flows
through the heat sink. A high-sensitivity flow meter
(series SDN, EGE, German) was connected at the heat
sink test module entrance to measure the flow rate and
calibrated by measuring the fluid weight and time
period. The DI water was used the coolant in this study
and its temperature is maintained at 20℃ at the test
module inlet.
The heat sink test module consists of heat sink, film
heater, thermal insulating layer and Teflon base with a
rectangular cavity as shown in Fig. 5. The film heater
(HK5565R5.3, Minco Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)
with size of 20mm×20mm was used to simulate the
heating power generated by the electronic chip and is
placed right below the region where parallel
microchannels, obstructive channels, or pin-fin array
are located in the heat sink. The heater was energized
by a DC power supply which could be regulated in the
ranges of 0-30V and 0-3A. In order to measure the
temperature uniformity at the heating area, 9 T-type
thermocouples of 0.1mm in diameter are attached and
sandwiched in between the heater and MCHS base
plate. By dividing the heating area into 9 equally-sized
rectangles, the thermocouples are attached
approximately at the centers of each rectangle. A
thermal insulating layer was finally placed at the
bottom of the Teflon cavity to reduce the heat loss from
the heater. This structure was secured in the Teflon base
by applying clamps around the Teflon base rims to
ensure good contact and tightness between heat sink
base plate, thermocouples and heater.
For the PCHS and OCHS, single inlet and single
outlet are involved. The fluid supply and collection are
directly connected to the pump and outlet reservoir by
tubes, respectively. For the PFHS, two inlets and two
outlets are involved. The fluid supply from the pump
was divided into two streams by using a T-junction and
then connected to the inlets of the heat sink. Similarly, a
T-junction was used to collect fluid streams coming
from the outlets of the heat sink and then dumped to the
outlet reservoir.
The data acquisition system consisted of a computer,
16-bit, 16-channel PCMCIA A/D card, and signal
conditioning circuitry. The system was controlled using
Labview programs.
3.2 Experimental device calibrations and experimental
procedures
The experiment starts from turning on the pump and
heater for specific flow rate and heating power. All of
the pressure and temperature signals were recorded in
the data acquisition system for analyses after the steady
state was reached. The flow meter with accuracy of
±0.5% was connected at the entrance of the MCHS test
module to measure the flow rate in the flow loop. The
differential pressure transducer was factory calibrated
with an uncertainty of ±0.2% at the nominal value
50kPa. All the thermocouples were calibrated in a
thermostat water bath and the accuracy was found to be
within 0.2 K. The input voltage and current to the
heater were controlled by a power supply with
accuracies of 0.5%.
4. Results and Discussion
In this study, experiments are performed for flow rate
Q and heating power of the heater q in the ranges
of 30~50ml/min and 6~15W, respectively. Although
higher fluid flow rate and heating power can be used,
this study focuses on the justification of macroscale
heat transfer enhancement techniques in the microscale
dimension and therefore lower values of both flow rate
and heating power are employed for convenience in the
experimental setup and operation.
4.1 Temperature measurement results
In Tables 1, 2, and 3, the measured temperatures at
the heat sink outlets and heating areas for three heat
sinks studied are shown for various flow rates and
heating powers. For the heat sink directly contacts
with the electronic chip, the temperature of the heating
area on the heat sink base plate can be regarded as the
chip surface temperature if the contact resistance can be
ignored. As shown in Fig. 5 for PCHS and OCHS,
temperature measurement points are arranged such that
points 1, 2, and 3 are near the entrance of
microchannels, 4, 5, and 6 are at the central area of heat
sink, and 7, 8, and 9 are located near the exit of the
channels. Under fixed flow rate and heating power, it is
seen that temperature at the heating area increases
along the flow direction. That is, highest heat sink
temperature occurs at the downstream of the channels.
It is also seen that lower temperatures are measured at
the center of heat sink (measurement points 2, 5, and 8)
as compared with the points close to the edges of the
heat sinks. The reason for this result is clearly due to
the inlet arrangement. It is expected that more fluid
flow can be distributed into the channels located in the
central region of the heat sink. It is therefore more heat
can be convected away by the larger fluid flow rates in
these channels and results in lower heat sink
temperature. By comparing the temperature
measurement results between PCHS and OCHS, it is
found that higher temperatures were obtained in the
OCHS. Moreover, the outlet fluid temperature for both
PCHS and OCHS are almost identical. Based on the
heat transfer theory in the duct flow subject to constant
heat flux, the temperature measurement results indicate
that heat transfer coefficient is not enhanced by the
introduction of obstructive channels. The reason for this
observation may due to low aspect ratio of channel in
heat sink studied. Further studies are needed to verify
this conclusion.
For the PFHS, the measured temperature distribution
at the heating area is somewhat different from those of
PCHS and OCHS because of multiple inlet/outlet. It is
found that highest temperature always occurs at the
center (measurement point 5) of the heat sink for all the
fluid flow rates and heating powers studied. Because of
the transverse flow in the pin fin array, it is suspected
that part of the incoming fluids flow to the regions
close to the outlets before they reach the center of the
heat sink. This leads to a decrease of cooling capability
of the coolant at the center of the heat sink. As
compared with the PCHS and OCHS, it is found that
the highest temperatures in PFHS are always less than
those found in PCHS and OCHS which occur normally
at the exit of the channel under a given fluid flow rate
and a heating power.
The temperature uniformity at the heat sink base
plate is one of the methods in evaluating the heat sink
performance. Using the measured results shown in
Tables 1, 2, and 3, temperature uniformity of each heat
heat sink performance, it is found that the PFHS has the
best temperature uniformity, lowest thermal resistance,
and lowest pressure drop among the three types of heat
sinks studied. Based on these three parameters, it is also
found that the OCHS cannot provide better
performance than the PCHS. The reason for this result
may be due to low channel aspect used in the heat sink
design. Further studies on heat sinks with higher aspect
ratio are required to justify the results reported in this
study.
