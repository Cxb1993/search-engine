Access (DL-SDMA) assisted Multiuser Transmission
using Linear Dispersion Codes (LDC) is proposed for
space-time signaling, which attains the high diversity
order and a high throughput by jointly exploiting the
spatial- and time-domain. However, a potentially high
complexity may be imposed by the signal detection,
when aiming for achieving the optimum Maximum

Finally, a novel irregular KSD-CS design is proposed
to maintain an infinitesimally low BER at the lowest

we found that Irregular KSD-CS (IrKSD-CS) may
reduce the complexity by three orders of magnitude
at Eb/N0 = 5dB, while approaching the performance
of the full-search based KSD benchmarker detector.

I. INTRODUCTION
An attractive space-time signaling technique,
referred to as Linear Dispersion Coding (LDC),
was proposed by Hassibi and Hochwald [1]. The
family of LDCs exhibits a high flexibility in
terms of their diversity versus multiplexing-gain,
hence they have attracted substantial research at-
tention [2]–[4]. A LDC approaching the MIMO
channel’s capacity was proposed in [1], which
was refined in [2] for the sake of satisfying
different design criteria, such as minimizing the
BER or the BLock Error Ratio (BLER) [3]. An
iterative decoding aided DownLink (DL) SDMA
system was proposed in [5], which exploited
the knowledge of the users’ Spatio-Temporal
Channel Impulse Response (ST-CIRT) at the
Base Station (BS) for separating their transmit-
ted signals at the Multi-User Transmitter (MUT).
In this contribution we developed a novel LDC-
aided DL-SDMA scheme. By invoking an LDC
based space-time signaling technique, which
jointly exploits both the spatial- and time-domain
in order to increase the achievable degree of

symbol stream s(k)t [5]. Additionally, we define
the so-called Space-Time Preprocessor (STP)
matrix T (k)t ∈ CM×Lk , which was designed for
the sake of eliminating the Multi-User Interfer-
ence (MUI) [8] as detailed in [5]. Briefly, T (k)t
may be constructed based on the nullspace of the
matrix H˜(k)t , where the elements of H˜
(k)
t are
constituted by H(i)t |Ki=1,i6=k, in order to prevent
the user’s signals from being transmitted to other
users. Hence, the general received signal model
of the k-th user is given by,

where the second term of Equation 1 represents
the MUI, which will be entirely eliminated,

sents the AWGN noise vectors obeying the distri-
bution CN (0, No) for each constituent element,
where we have No = 2σ2n.
Let H(k) represent the observed ST-CIR of
the k-th user, which is assumed to be time-
variant over an interval of T slots, i.e. we have

as well as the same data rate of (Q/T = 2).
The capacity of a (6x6)-element MIMO system
assuming a Gaussian rather than discrete signal
input is also included as our benchmarker. On
the other hand, in Figure 2(b), we show that the
capacity may be potentially increased upon in-
creasing the number of independent data stream
Q from 4 to 5 or 6 while having the same value
of T , which is in this case T = 2. On the
other hand, the higher the value of Q, the higher
the signal detection complexity. Therefore, low
complexity signal detection is required.
IV. IRREGULAR CENTER-SHIFTING AIDED
K-BEST SPHERE DETECTION
As advocated in [5], [10], the SD process is
capable of providing a near-ML performance at
a low complexity. The nature of this non-linear
detection algorithm makes it eminently suitable
for operation in rank-deficient scenarios3, where
the family of linear detection algorithms, such as
MMSE detection, performs poorly. In the recent
literature [6], [9], [10], most research efforts
focus on the complexity reduction of each sphere
detection iteration. By contrast, our aim is to in-
troduce the concept of irregular sphere detection,
which is designed to reduce the overall iterative
decoding complexity by taking into account both
the complexity per iterative detection stage and
the number of iterations required.
In practice, the required ST-CIR knowledge
may be attained by using the estimation and
prediction schemes of [11], [12], which have
to be further assisted by the ST-CIR feedback
schemes of [13]. Naturally, accurate ST-CIR
3The rank-deficient scenario is defined as the case when the
number of transmitter antennas is higher than the number of
receive antennas.
estimation/prediction has the potential of sig-
nificantly reducing the residual MUI, which is
represented by the second term of Equation 3.
However, owing to space-limitations, here we
have to focus our attention on the proposed
irregular SD by stipulating the simplifying as-
sumption of having perfect ST-CIR. The achiev-
able complexity reduction remains valid in the
presence of imperfect ST-CIR, but the attainable
performance is expected to erode to a degree.
Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we will
remove the user index k, where this does not
cause any confusion. Furthermore, by defining
the effective channel matrix as He = HX , we
may write Equation 3 as
Y = HXd+N = Hed+N. (5)
A. K-best Sphere Detection
The ML solution of Equation 3, which was
further streamlined in Equation 5, may be equiv-
alently expressed as [10]:

d˘∈M

‖U(d˘− xˆc)‖
2, (6)
where U is a (Q×Q)-element upper-triangular
matrix and UHU = (HeHHe + 2σ2nI). Again,
MQc is the set of all possible candidates of
the Q-element transmitted data vector d. Fur-
thermore, xˆc is the transmitted symbol candi-
date considered to be the search centre of the
SD, which is usually the MMSE solution. Con-
sequently, let us define the objective function
which will be evaluated during the SD’s near-
ML search as [14]

demonstrated that the KSD operating without CS
may not have any iterative gain upon increasing
the extrinsic information provided for the SD,
as illustrated in Figure 5. On the other hand, the
KSD-CS scheme exhibits a substantial iterative
gain for both Ncand = 64 and Ncand = 256 K-

Systematic Convolutional (RSC) channel codec, having the octal
generator polynomials of G=[5,7], was employed by the system.

C. Irregular K-best Sphere Detection
In [7] a generic detection concept capable of
reducing the complexity of iterative decoding
was proposed, where a number of different con-
stituent detectors, such as Log-MAP, SD and
MMSE detectors were used to construct a so-
called irregular generic detector. In this paper,
we develop this concept further and invoke the
KSD-CS in conjunction with different values of
Ncand as the constituent detector components of
the IrGD. We refer to this scheme as the Irregu-
lar KSD-CS (IrKSD-CS). Owing to the limited
space available, we only briefly summarize the
concept of the IrKSD-CS in this paper. The
philosophy of the IrKSD-CS technique is that
of utilizing V number of KSD-CSs employing
different values of Ncand for detecting certain
predetermined segments of the transmitted sig-
nals, instead of using a fixed value of Ncand,
as justified later in this section. Based on the
appropriately optimized fractions of the received
signal, each KSD-CS generates its soft-bit esti-
mates of the appropriate fractions of the trans-
mitted signals. More specifically, for a trans-
mission block containing L encoded bits and
assuming that Nbps bits per symbol are transmit-
ted by the modulator, we have L/Nbps symbols
per transmission block, where each transmission
block is mapped to a separate time-slot. At the
receiver, we invoke the proposed IrKSD scheme,
which is constituted by V component KSD-CSs
employing different values of Ncand. Let Cv be
the complexity of the v-th component detector
of the IrKSD-CS scheme. Then the weighting
coefficient αv, v = 1, · · ·V , of the KSD-CSs has
to satisfy:
1 =
V∑
v=1
αv, Cgd =
V∑
v=1
αvCv, and αv ∈ [0, 1], ∀v,
(10)
where Cgd is the average complexity of the
IrKSD scheme.
In this paper we introduce the framework
of IrGD [7] by appropriately amalgamating a
number of K-best sphere detectors, each using
a different value of Ncand, although this may
be simply interpreted as using a single KSD-
CS and a variable value of Ncand. The K-
best sphere detectors using different values of
Ncand have a different decoding performance
and a different detection complexity. Hence,
by invoking appropriately amalgamated K-best
sphere detectors associated with different values
of Ncand, the IrKSD-CS scheme was designed to
reduce the overall complexity, which takes into
account both the complexity per iterative detec-
tion stage and the number of iterations required,

Ncand = 1, 64, 128, 256 and 4096. Figure 6(b)
shows that the IrKSD-CS detector has only a
modest Eb/N0 degradation of about 1 dB com-
pared to the KSD-CS benchmarker associated
with Ncand = 4096. The KSD-CS detector using
Ncand = 4096 conducted a full search over
the set of MQ = 46 candidates, i.e. by taking
into account all the possible candidates. By
contrast, the KSD-CS detector using Ncand = 1
represents the MMSE detector. Therefore, the

employed at the Eb/N0 values ranging from 3, 4, 5 to 6 dB
were [0,0,0,0.34,0.66], [0.37,0.03,0.6,0,0], [0.93,0.07,0,0,0] and
[0.995,0.005,0,0,0], respectively.
proposed IrKSD-CS provides a flexible detection
framework. By switching the value of Ncand of
KSD-CS detector according to the appropriately
designed weighting-coefficient vector α, the sys-
tem may be expected to operate at the lowest
possible iterative decoding complexity.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we investigated iterative decod-
ing aided DL-SDMA invoking LDC aided MUT,
which has a higher achievable capacity than the
basic DL-SDMA using no LDC. Furthermore,
we proposed the IrKSD-CS algorithm designed
for reducing the complexity of the iterative de-
coding aided system. By appropriately designing
the weighting-coefficient vector α, the IrKSD-
CS aided system may potentially provide the
lowest possible iterative decoding complexity.
Quantitatively, Figure 6 suggests that the IrKSD-
CS aided iterative DL-SDMA system associated
with α = [0.93, 0.07, 0, 0, 0] may reduce the
complexity by three orders of magnitude at
Eb/N0 = 5dB, when compared to the KSD-
CS benchmark detector associated with Ncand =
4096.

2theorem [8], which requires a sampling rate fs in excess of 2fd,
where fd denotes the normalized Doppler frequency. According
to Figure 1, we have fs = 1Tp+Td and the condition of fs =
1
Tp+Td
≥ 2 · fd should be satisfied.
On the other hand, each MS estimates its ST-CIRTs using the
received pilots as indicated in Figure 1. Assuming that there
are (M × N) ST-CIRT coefficients for each frame – which
tacitly implies having a single complex-valued CIR tap – and
the DL receivers quantize each ST-CIRT coefficient using q bits
for the magnitude and q bits for the phase, the symbol interval
Tq required for feeding back all the ST-CIRT coefficients of each
transmission frame is given by
Tq =
(M ·N) · 2 · q
Nbps
, (1)
where Nbps is the feedback transmission rate of the MS’s Up-
Link (UL) transmitter. The propagation delay of the channel may
be negligible compared to Tq , due to the high number of ST-
CIRT coefficients representing the MIMO channels.
Assuming that 10% DL pilot overhead is employed, we have
Tp/Td = 0.1. By letting fs = 1Tp+Td = 2 · fd, we may define
the normalized feedback overhead Λ when the DL-receivers use
q-bit quantization as
Λq =
Tq
Td
≈ Tq · 1.1 · 2 · fd ≈ Tq · fd. (2)
Let us now consider two schemes. First, the MSs employ a-
bit quantization to convey the ST-CIRT coefficients to the BS,
which are subject to a feedback duration of Ta. In the second
scheme, the MSs employing b-bit quantization to signal the ST-
CIRT coefficients to the BS and have the corresponding feedback
duration of Tb. Then we define the normalized overhead
reduction ratio RΛ associated with using b instead of a bits
as
RΛ =
Λa − Λb
Λa
=
Ta−Tb
Td
Ta
Td
=
Ta − Tb

M = 6 DL transmit antennas and supports K = 3
MSs. Each MS has N = 2 receive antennas. When
the MS employs a q = 3-bit quantization scheme, we
require Tq = (6 · 2) · 2 · 3/4 = 18 symbols, where we
assumed that the MS had a feedback transmission rate
of Nbps = 2 · 2 bits per transmit symbol interval with
the aid of using 4QAM and two transmit antennas.
Let us furthermore assume that fd = 0.001. Then
the normalized overhead of the q = 3-bit quantization
scheme is Λq = 0.018, i.e. 1.8%.
By contrast, when the system adopts a q = 2-bit ST-
CIRT quantization instead of using q = 3-bit quantiza-
tion, the resultant normalized overhead reduction ratio
becomes RΛ = (3− 2)/3 = 0.33, i.e.33%.
In this study, we did not take the channel prediction error
into account in order to focus our attention on the investigation
of the limited ST-CIRT feedback. Assuming that the channel
prediction is perfect, the ST-CIRT coefficients are contaminated
by the quantization error only. Hence, at every symbol interval
we assume that the BS exploits the current ST-CIRT coefficients
quantized by using the CQs. Consequently, in our forthcoming
discourse the inaccuracy of the ST-CIRT employed by the BS
will be dominated by the limited ST-CIRT feedback.
III. INTRODUCTION TO CSI QUANTIZATION
In general, the quantization of ST-CIRT may utilize two differ-
ent types of quantization schemes, namely Scalar Quantization
(SQ) and Vector Quantization (VQ) [9]. Vector quantization may
be viewed as a generalization of SQ, where several ST-CIRT
coefficients are quantized jointly. The attainable performance
of VQ may be superior to that of SQ, because VQs exploit
the correlation between the components of the input-vector [9],
which in our case is either the spatial-domain or time-domain
correlation of ST-CIRT coefficients. However, since in our study
uncorrelated ST-CIRT coefficients are assumed, we employ a SQ
scheme.
The accuracy of quantization is typically measured by the
distortion D, defined as the mean squared error of the quantized
signal hq , namely as
D = E
˘
(hq − h)
2
¯
, (4)
where h is the signal to be quantized. In order to reduce the
distortion D, we may use a high-resolution quantizer, which
increases the number of quantization levels. Let us denote the
number of quantization levels of the SQ by Nq. Then, q =
log2(Nq) bits are required to represent Nq quantization levels.
Furthermore, we may design the spacing between quantization
levels to be uniform or nonuniform [10]. The benefit of using
nonuniform quantization [9] is that the dynamic range that
can be accommodated for a given number of bits may be
significantly increased without increasing the average distortion
of the quantizer. This is achieved by exploiting the knowledge
of the Probability Distribution Function (PDF), of the input
signal. A NonUniform Quantizer (NUQ) is typically designed by
placing the quantization intervals more densely, where the PDF
indicates a high relative frequency of the input samples. The
most widely used codebook design algorithm is the Generalized
Lloyd Algorithm (GLA) [9].
In our study, the magnitude of the input signal’s PDF is
assumed to be Rayleigh distributed, while the phase of it is
assumed to be uniformly distributed. Therefore we employ a
scalar ST-CIRT quantizer using NUQ to separately quantize the
magnitude and phase of each CIR coefficient using q bits. We
used the GLA [9] to obtain the N quantization intervals for both
the magnitude and phase of the ST-CIRT coefficients.
In this paper we intend to focus our attention on the investiga-
tion of our iterative DL-SDMA system using limited-feedback,
while perfect CSI is assumed to be available at the DL receivers.
Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity, an free-error feedback
channel is assumed. Hence, the mean square error of the ST-
CIRT quantizer, which is denoted by σ2ST−CIRT , is given by
σ2ST−CIRT = D = E

IV. EXIT-CHART OPTIMIZED CHANNEL QUANTIZATION
In this paper we propose an algorithm, which allows the
system to use a different number of quantization bits q in
different symbol intervals. The goal is to minimize the average
of q over a number of symbol intervals, while maintaining a
certain target performance. Let us assume for example that there
are 100 symbol intervals. The receiver quantizes the ST-CIRTs
of 40 symbol intervals using q = 2-bit quantization and the rest
of the ST-CIRTs of 60 symbol intervals using 3-bit quantization.
Therefore during the observed 100 symbol intervals, the average
number of feedback bits for each sampled ST-CIRT conveying
both the magnitude and phase is q = 2 · 0.4 + 3 · 0.6 = 2.6.
The question is now, how to determine the required number of
quantization bits q for the sampled ST-CIRTs.
In order to resolve this design dilemma, we adopt the design
concept of irregular convolution codes [11] and aim to minimize
the average value of q, while assuming that an open EXIT-
tunnel is still attainable for the iterative system at a given Eb/N0
values. More explicitly, we exploit the fact that similarly to
having different channel SNRs, the different amount of ST-CIRT

the j-th modulator of 4. Accordingly, as illustrated in Figure
4, the MUT-STP matrix T (k) will be generated by using the
ST-CIRTs, which were quantized using four different number of
quantization bits per ST-CIRT coefficient for the four segments
of transmitted symbols. The MUT-STP matrix T (k) generated
by the q-bit quantized ST-CIRTs is denoted by T (k)(Hq−bitq ),
as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 5 shows the structure of the iterative DL-SDMA using

segments. Accordingly, for each segment of the received signals,
the MMSE detector will generate the soft-bits as the input of the
URC decoder. The four segments of the extrinsic information
bits generated by the URC decoder will become the apriori
information bits of the channel decoder of Figure 5. As the
iterative decoding process is carried out, the extrinsic information
bits of the channel decoder will be partitioned into four segments
again in order to construct four segments of apriori bits of the
URC decoder. The four-segment output of the URC decoder will
then be forwarded to the MMSE detector for the next iteration
of the decoding process.

VI. EXIT CHART ANALYSIS
In the following discussions, we provide the EXIT chart
analysis of our iterative DL-SDMA systems using conventional
CQs and the proposed ECO-CQs.
A. Iterative DL-SDMA Systems Using Conventional CQ
Figure 6 illustrates the EXIT chart of the iterative DL-SDMA
systems using the conventional CQs in conjunction with different
number of quantization bits, q, which is ranging from q = 2, 3, 4
to 5. Observe that by reducing the number of quantization bits,
the inner EXIT-curves, which characterizes the MMSE detector
and URC-decoder represented inner systems, are getting closer
to the outer EXIT-curve, which characterizes the employed RSC
channel decoder, until the open tunnel disappears between them.
Based on this EXIT chart, we expect that the system will suffer
from a high BER, when using 2-bit CQ at Eb/N0 = 6dB. On
the other hand, the system using a 5-bit CQ performs close to
the one benefiting from perfect ST-CIRT.

Therefore, in order to assist the system in maintaining an open
EXIT-tunnel at Eb/N0 = 6dB, we have to increase the number
of quantization bits to q = 3. However, the EXIT-tunnel of
the systems using 3-bit CQ is rather wide. With the aid of the
proposed algorithm of Section IV, and given a certain level of
Eb/N0, we will be able to design the system for maintaining

Abstract
An iterative detection aided Down-Link (DL) Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) system is proposed. The Base Station
(BS) requires DL Channel State Information (CSI) estimated by and fed back from theMobile Station (MS) for separating the DL
signals to be transmitted to the MSs from the BS. We investigate the achievable system performance subject to finite-accuracy
CSI feedback. The achievable receiver performance is investigated with the aid of Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Charts.
Furthermore, a novel concept, referred to as the EXIT-Chart Optimized CSI Quantization (ECO-CQ) is proposed. The ECO-CQ
scheme assists the system in maintaining the lowest possible CSI feedback overhead, while ensuring that an open EXIT-tunnel
is still attainable, which implies maintaining an infinitesimally low BER. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed ECO-
CQ may reduce the normalized feedback overhead compared to the conventional CQ.
.
Introduction
The iterative DL-SDMA system by exploiting the Spatio-Temporal
Channel Impulse Response at Transmitter (ST-CIRT) is capable of
separating the signals destined for the different users at the base
station’s DL transmitter and hence results in a Multi-User Inter-
ference (MUI)-free single-user performance [1]. In practice, the ST-
CIRT required by the BS’s DL transmitter may be obtained via a
feedback channel from the DL receiver. The DL receiver is typically
designed to feed back the quantized ST-CIRT to the BS by striking
a balance between reducing the amount of the feedback informa-
tion and maintaining a near-perfect MUI rejection. However, lim-
ited amount of feedback bits to BS results in having partial ST-CIRT
only.
Against this back ground, in this paper we analyze the achievable
performance of iterative DL-SDMA systems employing imperfect
ST-CIRT subject to finite-accuracy CSI feedback. Its impact on the
convergence behavior of the system will be demonstrated by us-
ing Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts [2]. We propose an
algorithm, which assists us in exploring the overhead required for
maintaining an open EXIT-tunnel. We refer to the CSI quantization
employing this algorithm as the EXIT-Chart Optimized CSI Quan-
tizer (ECO-CQ).
The Scenario of ST-CIRT Feedback
Consider the scenario when the BS periodically sends pilots to the
DL receivers, so that theMSsmay estimate the ST-CIRTs and use the
allocated feedback channels to periodically feed back the ST-CIRTs,
as illustrated in Figure 1.

1 EXIT-Chart Optimized Channel Quantization
Instead of using single quantizer to quantize the ST-CIRT, we em-
ploy NQ different number of quantization bits to quantize the ST-
CIRT. The goal is to minimize the average of the quantization bit
q over a number of symbol intervals, while maintaining a certain
target performance. We adopt the design concept of irregular con-
volution codes [3] and aim to minimize the average value of q,
while assuming that an open EXIT-tunnel is still attainable for the
iterative system at a given Eb/N0 values. For example, we have
q = {2, 3, 4, 5} for NQ = 4. The ST-CIRTs in the segment of αjNts
symbol intervals will be quantized by using a specific number of
quantization bits q, where αj is a weight, controlling the size of each
segment. Then the weighting coefficient αj has to satisfy:
1 =
NQ
∑
j=1
αj, q¯ =
NQ
∑
j=1
αjq, and αj ∈ [0, 1], ∀j. (1)
where q¯ is an averaged value over the observed transmission block.
According to [3], the corresponding EXIT function TI(Iin), which
characterizes the inner decoder’s EXIT-curve in the system, is given
by
TI(Iin) =
NQ
∑
j=1
αjTq(Iin), (2)
where Tq(Iin) denotes the EXIT function, when the ST-CIRTs are
quantized by using q-bit channel quantization.
