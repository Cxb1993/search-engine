Abstract 
 
The propagation of sound wave in the ocean is predominantly influenced by marine 
environment. Factors of influence include sea water, sediment under the sea floor and 
bathymetry. Consequently, the ever-changing acoustics environment in the shallow sea is 
very complicated to analyze with all the details involved.  
The purpose of this project is to investigate the complicated environmental characteristic 
in shallow water. The analyses focus on establishing the coupling factor and uncertainty of 
sound wave that effect the environmental perturbation.  
The velocity of sound is used as the main parameter to characterize various physical 
phenomena in sea water, and serves as the basis of calculation in underwater acoustic field. 
The sound speed of sea water is greatly influenced by its temperature, salinity, internal wave 
and current. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) was applied to analyze the 
measurement data of sound speed. Furthermore, the complicated sound speed was rebuilt by 
simpler orthogonal function. The effect of bottom sediment variation is also a key point in this 
project. 
The project takes place a field experiment around Dan-Shui River area to collect the 
environment data and measure the acoustic data. These data were to verify the model result 
and to support the application of underwater communication.  
To quantize the uncertainty of environment parameter in shallow, and establish its 
priority in effects of underwater sound propagation is the key point of sound field variation 
that can substantially enhance understanding of characteristics of underwater waveguide. 
Application of results from increased understanding of waveguide characteristic in shallow 
water includes acoustical issues involving underwater communication.

壹、計畫目標 
1.1 研究背景 
由於科技進步，人口的增加，使得人類活動領域自陸地向上往太空及向下往海洋發
展，太空科技受限於距離遠，經費門檻高，加以海洋的範圍寬廣，較易接近，使得向海
洋開發新領域，成為各國科技開發的重要領域。聲波是水中最主要的能量形式，要了解
海洋就必要善用聲波，並掌握聲波於水下的各種特性，惟水下聲波在傳遞過程中，受各
種海洋環境變動因素影響甚大，這種影響在淺水海域更顯得重要。 
聲波於海洋中傳遞主要受到海洋環境的影響而有所變化，這些影響因素包括了廣大
的海水，海底下的沉積物、底床，以及上下不同介質（如大氣、岩石）間的界面。這些
海洋環境隨時間或空間的結構不斷變化，將影響聲波在海洋中傳播的特性，例如內波現
象會使得聲波傳遞路徑大幅改變，故掌握環境的變動因素，是瞭解水下聲波傳遞的首要
工作。 
本研究之重點即在探討淺水波導環境之特性，予以分析聲波傳遞受海洋環境不確定
度之影響，以有效解算淺水波導環境之聲波特性，提供作為水下通訊之應用。 
1.2 目標 
(一)尋求有效之海洋環境水下聲速變化分析方法 
(二)完成水下波導環境受聲速及底質影響之變動關係分析 
(三)建立海洋環境與水下聲場間之耦合變動關係 
(四)規劃實驗進行實測資料蒐集，以驗證並修改研究成果 
(五)完成淺水海域之水下聲場不確定度分析 
(六)建構水下通訊所需之波導環境分析模組 
1.3 研究要點 
由於聲速受到溫度、鹽度及深度等因素的改變而改變，而這些因素又因海洋環境在
時間與空間的不同而改變，造成水下聲速的變動因素非常複雜，若是要依據複雜多變的
水中聲速資料進行水下波導（Underwater waveguide）相關的聲學分析，其所得的結果
將變得雜亂而無法處理，故有必要以較簡單的參數來描述水下聲速隨環境變化的重要關
鍵因素。其中經驗正交函數（Empirical Orthogonal Functions, EOF）是最常用的方法，
屬於主軸分析(Principal Analysis)法中的一種方法。它依據實際的觀測資料，將水下聲速
隨時間及空間複雜變動的特性，建立變方矩陣（Covariance matrix），並經由 EOF 分析
而獲得數個正交函數的組合後，以較簡單 EOF 函數重建水中聲速的特性。這些 EOF 彼
此具正交特性，並且依其相對應的特徵值（eigenvalue）值的大小，代表其在整體變化
中所代表的比例，利用這種特性，便可依需求，適度調整取用 EOF 數目之多寡。由於
它是依據使用者之經驗進行其所代表的物理意義判斷，故稱為經驗正交函數[1]。經驗正
交函數的好處是可以分析大量的資料，並且從中獲得具有代表性之空間及時間上的變化
特性。

2.1.2 海水的鹽度 
臺灣附近表層海水鹽度的變化，除了少數受到河川入海口影響，一般變化相
當微小，其值介於 34 至 34.8psu，如圖 2-2 於 30 公尺之鹽度分佈。不過從夏天到
冬天鹽度的分布型態，受中國大陸和臺灣的河川淡水排放與季節性降雨變化影
響，相對變化較大。 
在八月和九月降雨較多之季節，臺灣河水注入海洋達到最高鋒，但是臺灣河
水注入所產生的稀釋效應因受到高鹽度（約 35psu）的黑潮水混合之影響而抵消
掉，致使臺灣四周表面海水的鹽度並沒有明顯降低至 34psu 以下。冬天時低溫低
鹽的北方大陸沿岸流，使得冬季中國大陸沿岸呈現較低鹽度分布。 
2.1.3 海流 
流經台灣東岸的「黑潮」是北太平洋環流的一部份，亦是全世界最重要的海
流之一，它負有調節熱帶地區與高緯度地區之熱量平衡機制，亦是台灣附近的主
要海流，黑潮受到地形影響所產生的湧昇流，得台灣東北方海域成為豐富漁場。
複雜的海底地形及季風變化與黑潮間交互作用，形成台灣附近主要海流運動，敘
述如下：圖 2-3[6]︰ 
（一）黑潮主流︰黑潮為來自赤道附近的暖流，具高溫高鹽度特性，黑潮北
流至臺灣南端附近，受地形影響分成兩股︰主流沿臺灣東北上，流速達 1m/sec，
有時高達 2m/sec。一般而言，夏季流速較快，表面水溫平均達 27℃，對臺灣東部
的氣候與漁產都有重大影響。
           圖 2-3 台灣附近海流示意圖    圖 2-4 台灣週邊海底地形[5]
 
（二）黑潮支流︰黑潮支流自巴士海峽沿臺灣西岸而上，夏季時受到季風吹
送，可一直流經整個臺灣海峽；冬季時海峽北部海面因有盛行的東北季風吹送，
黑潮支流流至澎湖群島附近，與北方的中國沿岸流會合海。 
（三）中國沿岸流︰起源於渤海與黃海北部，沿大陸海岸南下，受緯度及長
江黃河等大型淡水河流注入影響，屬於低溫低鹽度的冷流。冬季因有東北季風之
助，流到臺灣海峽後與黑潮支流相會於澎湖群島附近，會合後再一起流入南海；
夏季時，黑潮支流強勁，就無法流到臺灣海峽。 
（四）南海海流︰冬季時，此一海流無法流入臺灣海峽，在夏季由於有西南

了 224Hz 聲源，在大陸棚 Env120（S4）附近佈放了垂直聽音陣列（Vertical Line Array, 
VLA），後續的分析中，將以 Env350 所量測的海水溫度資料，進行相關水文環境之 EOF
分析及對水下通訊之聲波傳遞影響。

圖 2-6 Env350 在 IT期間位於 60公尺處之
溫度變化頻譜圖及頻段分隔示意圖 
2.2.1 ASIAEX 溫度錨碇資料 
Env350 自 2001 年 4 月 21 日至 5 月 18 日每日量測溫度剖面圖，其資料顯示
5 月 1 日至 5 月 5 日溫度剖面顯示海水溫度剖面變化較為緩和，主要是受內潮變
化影響（Internal Tide, IT），其餘時間均有較大的內波影響，其中以 5 月 6 日至 5
月 10 日之變化最為劇烈，由於內波現象會造成水文環境的劇烈變化，使得用以
進行水下通訊之聲波訊號偵測效能降低，故後續分析將以此時段做為受非線性內
波影響（Nonlinear Internal Wave, NIW）。 
在南海海域的海水溫度變化週期，主要受到中尺度海洋作用、潮汐及高頻的
非線性內波等因素影響，故針對 Env350 之海水溫度資料，可以分成次潮汐
（Subtidal）、潮汐（Tidal）及超潮汐（Supertidal）等三個頻段，利用頻段分析
及 EOF 法，進行內潮期間（IT, 5/1~5/5）及非線性內波期間（NIW, 5/6~5/10）之
海水溫度資料分析，用以偵測影響水下通訊之非線性內波的活動。 
2.2.2 Env 350 資料之 EOF 分析 
首先利用適當濾波器將 Env350 之不同頻段資料取出，如圖 2-6，依據其頻率
特性，分成次潮汐頻段（Subtidal），潮汐頻段（Tidal）及超潮汐頻段（Supertidal）
等三個頻段，分別代表中尺度海洋作用、潮汐及高頻的非線性內波等不同環境因
素所造成之海水溫度變化機制，相關的顏色表示在後續描敘均採用一致作法，也
就是紅色為次潮汐頻段，綠色為潮汐頻段，黑色為非線性內波，藍色則為未經處
理的原始資料。 
利用 EOF 法進行 Env350 資料不同頻段的正交函數的解析，圖 3-7 表示內潮
作用期間之不同頻段資料，其各個 EOF 函數所佔整個變化量之累積曲線，由圖中
顯示，綠色潮汐頻段的第一個 EOF 即佔了 80％變化量，而黑色的超潮汐頻段的
第一個 EOF 僅佔了 40%的變化量，表示內潮 IT 期間，非線性內波作用較弱，這
說明了利用不同頻段的第一個 EOF 函數變化量應可進行海水溫度變化主要作用
機制進行偵測，為了進一步驗證此一機制正確性，針對 04/22 至 05/18 期間之
Env350 錨碇資料進行計算，以 24 小時之資料為一個單元進行 EOF 分析，並以潮
汐頻段及超潮汐頻段第一個 EOF 百分比變化進行繪圖。如圖 3-8 顯示，綠色曲線

參、海下聲能傳播受環境變化之影響分析 
3.1 環境變動的不確定性分析 
如第 2.1 節所述，有許多環境因素會影響聲波傳遞，為了解這些環境變動因素的不
確定對音傳損耗的不確定性影響，本節以 ASIAEX-SCS 之底質與水文資料，模擬水下通
訊之聲波傳遞的海洋環境，建立一環境不確定性的分析模型。 
典型的淺水海域是由空氣－海水及海水－底質等兩種界面所組成，一般底質具有較
水層高的密度與聲速，對於均質的水層而言，便組成了「佩克瑞司波導（Pekeris 
Waveguide）」，如圖 3-1 之環境模型示意圖，其水層的聲場與環境參數間的關係可以

圖 3-1 不確定性分析之環境變動模型  
 
依據Turgut[16]利用Chirp Sonar對ASIAEX-SCS實驗海域所進行底質參數估算的資
料，加上音源位置的不確定性，利用圖 3-1 之計算模型，進行音傳損耗不確定分析，相
關環境參數的不確定性定義於表 3-1 中，由於環境相關參數包括音源位置 zo、接收器位
置 r、水層密度ρ、水層聲速 c、底質密度ρ1、底質聲速 c1 及底質衰減係數α等在式（3-1）
中已經定義相對應的關係，在計算時，依序僅將一個環境參數依據所設定的不確定性區
間上、下限值，其餘參數則維持固定，利用（3-1）式進行音傳損耗計算，以分析單一
環境參數之不確定區間對音傳損耗不確定之變化關係。按照此一程序，依序對每一環境
參數建立不確定性變動計算，及對應之音傳損耗變動區間。 
依據圖 3-1 之模型及表 3-1 之環境參數資料，假設音源頻率為 224Hz，水層的聲速
為定值 1520m/s，計算距離 5km 外，接收器深度 10m 之音傳損耗，如圖 3-2 所示，其水

圖 3-5 顯示 Shelf Track 的分析結果，在 5 月 4 日的海水溫度剖面，由於水深
較淺，海水溫度受地形影響，其整體的變動性較大，半日週期之變化較不明顯，在 1300
時具有較深的層次深度，其水下通訊之偵測距離較遠，之後隨著層次深度遞減，偵測距
離亦縮減。5 月 8 日主要受到非線性內波 NIW 海水溫度變化劇烈的影響。此外，由於
Shelf Track 之整體水深較淺，受到海底反彈作用影響，可使聲波能量傳送較遠距離，所
以整體水下通訊的偵測距離比 Slope Track 要遠，此結果與 Chiu[20]所計算相符。

肆、結論與評析 
由於地形及潮汐週期運動之影響，使得淺水海域內波活動頻繁，加上內波生成後，
受地形及內波間交互作用影響，造成海洋環境變動性大，更增加淺水海域之水下通訊偵
測效能之複雜性。 
在針對南海的海洋環境，以及 2001年在南海執行的「亞洲聲學實驗 ASIAEX」所獲
的資料，進行內波活動對水下通訊之聲波傳遞影響進行分析。 
水下通訊偵測距離主要受到海洋環境變動的影響，由於複雜的海洋環境，在台灣附
近或是淺水海域，有必要對於影響水下通訊偵測的環境因素進行分析，以掌握關鍵的環
境影響因素，以做為水下通訊效能評估的依據。 
總而言之，水下通訊之聲波傳遞受水文環境影響變化甚大，在本研究中運用 EOF法
解析水文環境變化特性，並利用聲學模型進行水下通訊效能的模擬與分析，相關成果可
作為水下通訊偵測效能之預估與研究，提升水下通訊之運用效益。惟本計畫原規劃三年
之執行期程，因故後續兩年之計畫未獲核准，針對本計畫規劃之目標，於本年度中均已
大致完成，受限於期程縮短，配合總計畫第二年執行之淺水區域實驗尚未執行，故本計
畫所發展之相關模式與實測資料驗證均無法執行，殊為可惜。

本整合計畫之執行要感謝行政院國家科學委員會對本研究計畫的支持。同時亦感謝
所有各子計畫參與的教授、研究生、技術員、助理、助教等，對本研究案的付出與努力。

Abstract- Passive-phase conjugation (PPC), in a shallow water 
waveguide, the cross-correlation of impulse response and the 
impulse response immediately after, can be utilized as the channel 
equalizer to enhance the communication performance. PPC is 
more practical and simpler than Time Reversal Mirror (TRM) 
since the back propagation is simulated, instead of using source 
receiver array transmitting backward. This paper addresses the 
long range (32km) communication performance based on PPC 
with the 100bps BPSK modulation scheme. At- sea data analysis 
and simulations are performed to attribute to the maximum bit 
rate, bit error rate, phase shift and the optimum performance of 
PPC. The results show the realization of PPC is affected by the 
number of receivers and existent acoustic modal structure, which 
fluctuate due to the large-amplitude internal waves and a range-
dependent, shoaling bathymetry.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The rise of underwater exploitation and activities drives the 
development of underwater communications [1-2]. Sound 
wave is the most effective media to communicate in 
underwater, but the properties of sound propagation result in 
several obstacles in underwater acoustics communication [3]. 
Effort to overcome the obstacles is mainly put in system design 
and signal processing which includes equalization technique 
and array processing [3].  
Traditional equalizers are robust enough in air wireless 
communication, but usually fail in the water [4]. From the 
aspect of acoustic property, passive phase conjugation (PPC) is 
a new equalization skill which could compensate for the 
multipath effect and could cooperate with other equalizers [5].  
PPC, similar to time-reversal mirror (TRM) processing, bases 
on acoustic mode characteristics, use array signal to 
compensate for signal distortion [6]. But the performance of 
PPC equalizer is dependent on the characteristics of acoustic 
field. 
The acoustic field in the South China Sea  (SCS) is highly 
fluctuated [7-8], and the PPC performance is hard to 
determined or estimated. Nonlinear internal waves and internal 
tides activities are very strong in the SCS [9-10]. These 
activities together with the shoaling bathymetry result in high 
variability on acoustic energy, received structure, and vertical 
distribution. 
Several questions rise under the environment and acoustic 
uncertainties, which are stated as follow.  
1) How is the communication performance with only 
quadrature demodulation system and with PPC equalizer in an 
environment teeming with internal waves? 
2) How will the PPC performance fluctuated in different 
ocean circumstances? 
3) What is the relation between the communication 
performance and the acoustic mode field? 
The objective of this paper is to answer the questions above, 
and this paper is structured as follow. The communication 
performance based on quadrature demodulation system and 
PPC equalizer will be shown in section II and III respectively. 
Section II includes the analysis of simulation result and the 
experiment data, and also introduces the relation between the 
communication performance and the acoustic mode field. 
Section III performs basic PPC processing and gives the 
analysis results. Finally, the summaries will be given in section 
IV. 
 
II. COMMUNICATION PERFORMANCE BASED ON QUADRATURE 
DEMODULATION SCHEME 
Modeling results provide the predicted symbol error rates in 
every meter. In this section, the communication performance 
using simulated data is first studied. And next, the experiment 
data will be analyzed in this section, too.  
A. Simulation 
Three different cases are simulated to obtain the channel 
impulse responses and to analyze the communication 
performances, include one case of background status, one case 
of the nonlinear internal waves propagating on slope, and one 
case of the nonlinear internal waves on shelf break. The

Figure 3 The symbol constellations from 5 m to 115 m in the case of nonlinear 
internal waves propagating on shelf break. 
 
Symbols are scattered in the middle except for the case of 
nonlinear internal waves propagate via shelf break. The depths 
of channels at 35 and 45m in Figure 3 have the error-free 
symbol constellations due to both the enhanced energy and 
constructive interference as internal waves via shelf break. 
Unlike the channels in Figure 2, even though enhanced energy 
flux of the middle water column but not contribute to 
constructive interference. This makes the performances of 
symbols not as good as which of the case of internal waves 
propagating via shelf break. 
B. Experiment Data 
In this section, BPSK data collected at sea will be processed 
by using quadrature demodulated receiver. The data is in 
support of the same observations made above, based on results 
of modeling. Receivers (ch1-ch16) are deployed from 40 
meters to 124 meters of the water column and received data are 
processed as the symbol error rates corresponding to the depths 
of deployment. 
1) Background case: The output symbols of model and data 
are displayed in the symbol constellation plots. Figure 4(a), (b), 
and (c) show the simulation results of BPSK symbols for one 
sequence (511 symbols) at depths of experiment; (d), (e), (f) 
are the data results of channel 3, 10 and 15 for two sequences 
(1022 symbols) over 10.22 seconds.  Data results conform very 
well to the observations shown in simulation results. 
 
Figure 4 The symbol constellations of the simulation result and the experiment 
data in the background case. 
 
The three channels are respectively selected from the upper-
middle, lower-middle and lower water column. Very like the 
simulation results, the symbols are scattered and not easily 
identified at channel 3 and 10, but are more clearly separated at 
channel 15. As the channel impulse response functions 
mentioned above, channel 3 and 5 could not be clearly traced 
as two symbol groups due to the lower signal energy and 
multiple path effect. From simulation results, they are all 
deployed in the middle water column which carries lower 
signal peak value, would easily make received symbols blurred 
by the multiple path effect and noise intrusions. Since the 
predicted output symbols are all noise-free; give the optimum 
bound of performance are still not easily recognized, worse 
results of data suffered by noise would be certainly expected.  
Channel 15, differ from the shallower channels, has good 
performance of symbols and made most of symbols properly 
classified as well as the model result even the symbols are not 
equalized. It conforms to the prediction of model, saying that 
higher signal level enhances the signal to noise ratio and 
reduces the error of transmitted symbols. Symbol error rates of 
all 16 channels comparing to simulation results are shown in 
Figure 5.  
In Figure 5, one might observe that below 70 meters two

acoustic channel, and mode 3 and 4 are the most dominated 
modes. One note that, differ from the background case, the 
acoustic energy diffused to the shallower so that the main 
signature of depth distribution of acoustical energy would 
appear in mode 3 and 4.  
Mode 4 in Figure 8, possesses 32% of energy flux, is the 
most dominated mode and mode 3, possesses 29% of energy 
flux, is expressed as the secondary dominated mode. These two 
modes, totally have over 60%, would make the vertical 
distribution of signal energy well described by these two 
modes.

Figure 8 The estimated mode amplitudes and the local mode function of mode 
3 and 4 at the location of receiving array. 
 
Figure 8 also shows the local mode functions of mode 3 and 
4. The thick-solid curve and thin-dash curve respectively 
represent mode 4 and mode 3. Hydrophones are denoted as the 
pink dots and green ones on mode 4 and 3. 
Ch5-9 residing at the first crest of local mode 4, possess 
higher energy than any other modes, give the lower symbol 
errors in data. This observation also reveals in the simulation 
results so that the depths among 55-70m the symbols stably 
hold at errors of ~12%. The reason for explaining the non 
error-free occur among this segment of depths, is that, though 
these depths residing at the first crest of mode 4 make the 
signal energy enhanced, but the other weak modes would also 
influence these depths so that the symbols could not certainly 
reduce to error free. These weaker modes contribute to the 
constructive or destructive interference.  
Ch9-11(also notice the modeling results among 70-85m), 
following Figure 8, are crossing the first node of local mode 4, 
so that at node the signal level carried by mode 4 diminishes to 
be zero, symbol errors in the meanwhile reach a climax due to 
the weakest signal energy.  
For depths below 80m, the magnitude of mode 3 is slightly 
higher than that of mode 4 shown in Figure 8, this means, as 
the mode amplitudes of mode 3 and 4 are qualitatively the 
same, mode 3 seems to become the dominated mode in the 
lower depths. For ch11-13, they also follow the magnitude of 
mode 4 but more accurately follow the magnitude of mode 3, 
gives that the signal energy, from first peak crosses the first 
node of mode 3 to the second peak, so that the symbol errors 
raise to the local highest at node than descend to the local 
minimum (error free) at the second peak of mode function. 
Symbol errors seem not to disobey the magnitude of mode 4, 
track the second crest of mode 4, across the node, then to the 
third crest.   
Note that at these channels they possess high signal peak 
value, yet not improve the symbol performances, this means, 
performance of symbols, nevertheless, not solely depends on 
the signal level of depths which channels carries. From 
predicted functions of channel impulse response mentioned 
above, even though higher peak values reveal in the middle 
water column, the performance would not be expected to be 
good in simulation results. The reason pointed out is the 
destructive effects of multiple paths on symbols as mentioned 
above. 
Higher signal level would never be the unique explanation 
for improving the performance of symbols, since destructive or 
constructive multiple paths play a role of domination of 
symbol interference. In a point of view of mode propagation to 
look at the destructive and constructive interference, they are 
manifested by the interferences of modal arrivals and modal 
structures. Take Ch1-4 (for depths of 40-60m) to be illustrated, 
they are all resided at the low magnitude both of mode 4 and 3, 
the other modes, i.e., mode 1, 6, 7 and 9, which have higher 
magnitudes of mode function in these depths, also appear at 
VLA and their amplitudes possess certain energy flux (of > 
5%), would doubtless interfere and disturb received signals ay 
these channels. This makes the symbols be fluctuated by the 
other modes, and these modes could not be ignored since they 
might have very high magnitude of modal function even lower 
amplitudes appear. Similarly for Ch14-16, the fluctuations are 
interpreted as the interactions of the other modes which have 
low amplitude but high magnitude of mode function.  
3) Case of internal waves on shelf break: As nonlinear 
internal waves propagate via shelf break, they re-squeeze the 
sound channel, so that the sound energy coupled from mode 3 
and 4 to the other higher modes, and mainly focus on mode 8.  
From the predicted results, the performances of demodulated 
symbols in this case are also low-grade. Also for simplifying 
the layout of printed pages, Figure 9 displays the symbol-error 
curve of received data and compares to the simulation results. 
One could also proclaim that two curves follow the same 
oscillation, that is to say, data results are qualitatively the same 
as observations shown in simulated results.  
Notice the output of symbols in the middle water column in 
Figure 9, at specific depths of 40-50m, 60-70m, and 80-90m, 
predicted ones are descending to the error free. But for depths 
of 70-80m, (only ch8 deployed among these depths), symbols 
with the result that most symbols spread out of the decision 
plane, make the symbol errors in modeling and data reach a 
local climax. This observation also conforms to those of data 
(for ch5 and11, the low symbol errors appear, but for ch8, error 
reaches the climax). The reason pointed out for explaining 
better performances of symbols at these specific depths and the 
abruptly deteriorated performance at ch8, could be conceived 
of the acoustic modal space.  
Figure 10 shows the estimated mode amplitudes for the 
acoustical channel invaded by the nonlinear internal waves via 
shelf break. Modes 1-16 are also displayed and one might 
observe that many modes were generated and excited due to

summed over the receivers. Symbols for one sequence or for 
greater than one sequence, are sampled to create the symbol 
constellation plot, and error performances are displayed.  
The results are first shown with the equalization of each 
single channel based on PPC with three different cases: the 
background case, the case of internal waves propagating via 
slope, and the case of self break.  
Figure 11 shows the constellation plots of the received 
symbols using single channel based on PPC and compare to the 
plots of symbols only with quadrature demodulation at CH9 
and CH15. The right column shows the symbols based on PPC, 
and one might observe that at CH9, differ from the result with 
quadrature demodulation, the symbols cluster appear into two 
circular areas even if only one channel is based on PPC, but 
many symbols still remain spread in the out layers. As 
mentioned above, the performance of symbols with quadrature 
demodulation at CH15, is easily recognized (error rate of ~1%) 
even without any equalization, but after PPC, the variance on 
Q-channel seems to slightly reduce. For rule of BPSK symbol 
decision, the data at CH9 based on equalization of PPC have 
symbol error rate of ~5.6%, which is better than that of ~18% 
appeared without PPC. To minimize the bit-error rate, the first 
is to use more receivers.

demodulation and single channel PPC in the background case. 
 
Similarly, Figure 12 shows the constellation plots of the 
received symbols using single channel based on PPC in the 
case of internal waves on slope and compare to the plots of 
symbols only with quadrature demodulation at CH8 and CH16. 
The right column shows the symbols based on PPC, and one 
might observe that at CH8, differ from the result with 
quadrature demodulation, the symbols cluster appear into two

As displayed above, the performance of symbols with 
quadrature demodulation at any channel is not easily 
recognized without using equalizers, but after PPC, the 
variance on Q-channel could reduce and a clearer clustering of 
the symbols into two circular areas would be observed. For 
rule of BPSK symbol decision, the data at CH8 based on PPC 
have symbol error rate of ~4%, which is better than that of 
~17% appeared without PPC. Similarly, to minimize the bit-
error rate, more receivers are used. 
Figure 13 shows the constellation plots of the received 
symbols using single channel based on PPC in the case of shelf 
break and compare to the plots of symbols only with 
quadrature demodulation at CH3 and CH16. The right column 
shows the symbols based on PPC, and one might observe that 
both at CH3 and CH16, differ from the result with quadrature 
demodulation, the symbols cluster appear into two circular 
areas even if only one channel is based on PPC, few symbols 
spread in the out layers.

Abstract- Passive-phase conjugation (PPC), in a shallow water 
waveguide, the cross-correlation of impulse response and the 
impulse response immediately after, can be utilized as the channel 
equalizer to enhance the communication performance. PPC is 
more practical and simpler than Time Reversal Mirror (TRM) 
since the back propagation is simulated, instead of using source 
receiver array transmitting backward. This paper addresses the 
long range (32km) communication performance based on PPC 
with the 100bps BPSK modulation scheme. At- sea data analysis 
and simulations are performed to attribute to the maximum bit 
rate, bit error rate, phase shift and the optimum performance of 
PPC. The results show the realization of PPC is affected by the 
number of receivers and existent acoustic modal structure, which 
fluctuate due to the large-amplitude internal waves and a range-
dependent, shoaling bathymetry.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The rise of underwater exploitation and activities drives the 
development of underwater communications [1-2]. Sound 
wave is the most effective media to communicate in 
underwater, but the properties of sound propagation result in 
several obstacles in underwater acoustics communication [3]. 
Effort to overcome the obstacles is mainly put in system design 
and signal processing which includes equalization technique 
and array processing [3].  
Traditional equalizers are robust enough in air wireless 
communication, but usually fail in the water [4]. From the 
aspect of acoustic property, passive phase conjugation (PPC) is 
a new equalization skill which could compensate for the 
multipath effect and could cooperate with other equalizers [5].  
PPC, similar to time-reversal mirror (TRM) processing, bases 
on acoustic mode characteristics, use array signal to 
compensate for signal distortion [6]. But the performance of 
PPC equalizer is dependent on the characteristics of acoustic 
field. 
The acoustic field in the South China Sea  (SCS) is highly 
fluctuated [7-8], and the PPC performance is hard to 
determined or estimated. Nonlinear internal waves and internal 
tides activities are very strong in the SCS [9-10]. These 
activities together with the shoaling bathymetry result in high 
variability on acoustic energy, received structure, and vertical 
distribution. 
Several questions rise under the environment and acoustic 
uncertainties, which are stated as follow.  
1) How is the communication performance with only 
quadrature demodulation system and with PPC equalizer in an 
environment teeming with internal waves? 
2) How will the PPC performance fluctuated in different 
ocean circumstances? 
3) What is the relation between the communication 
performance and the acoustic mode field? 
The objective of this paper is to answer the questions above, 
and this paper is structured as follow. The communication 
performance based on quadrature demodulation system and 
PPC equalizer will be shown in section II and III respectively. 
Section II includes the analysis of simulation result and the 
experiment data, and also introduces the relation between the 
communication performance and the acoustic mode field. 
Section III performs basic PPC processing and gives the 
analysis results. Finally, the summaries will be given in section 
IV. 
 
II. COMMUNICATION PERFORMANCE BASED ON QUADRATURE 
DEMODULATION SCHEME 
Modeling results provide the predicted symbol error rates in 
every meter. In this section, the communication performance 
using simulated data is first studied. And next, the experiment 
data will be analyzed in this section, too.  
A. Simulation 
Three different cases are simulated to obtain the channel 
impulse responses and to analyze the communication 
performances, include one case of background status, one case 
of the nonlinear internal waves propagating on slope, and one 
case of the nonlinear internal waves on shelf break. The

Figure 3 The symbol constellations from 5 m to 115 m in the case of nonlinear 
internal waves propagating on shelf break. 
 
Symbols are scattered in the middle except for the case of 
nonlinear internal waves propagate via shelf break. The depths 
of channels at 35 and 45m in Figure 3 have the error-free 
symbol constellations due to both the enhanced energy and 
constructive interference as internal waves via shelf break. 
Unlike the channels in Figure 2, even though enhanced energy 
flux of the middle water column but not contribute to 
constructive interference. This makes the performances of 
symbols not as good as which of the case of internal waves 
propagating via shelf break. 
B. Experiment Data 
In this section, BPSK data collected at sea will be processed 
by using quadrature demodulated receiver. The data is in 
support of the same observations made above, based on results 
of modeling. Receivers (ch1-ch16) are deployed from 40 
meters to 124 meters of the water column and received data are 
processed as the symbol error rates corresponding to the depths 
of deployment. 
1) Background case: The output symbols of model and data 
are displayed in the symbol constellation plots. Figure 4(a), (b), 
and (c) show the simulation results of BPSK symbols for one 
sequence (511 symbols) at depths of experiment; (d), (e), (f) 
are the data results of channel 3, 10 and 15 for two sequences 
(1022 symbols) over 10.22 seconds.  Data results conform very 
well to the observations shown in simulation results. 
 
Figure 4 The symbol constellations of the simulation result and the experiment 
data in the background case. 
 
The three channels are respectively selected from the upper-
middle, lower-middle and lower water column. Very like the 
simulation results, the symbols are scattered and not easily 
identified at channel 3 and 10, but are more clearly separated at 
channel 15. As the channel impulse response functions 
mentioned above, channel 3 and 5 could not be clearly traced 
as two symbol groups due to the lower signal energy and 
multiple path effect. From simulation results, they are all 
deployed in the middle water column which carries lower 
signal peak value, would easily make received symbols blurred 
by the multiple path effect and noise intrusions. Since the 
predicted output symbols are all noise-free; give the optimum 
bound of performance are still not easily recognized, worse 
results of data suffered by noise would be certainly expected.  
Channel 15, differ from the shallower channels, has good 
performance of symbols and made most of symbols properly 
classified as well as the model result even the symbols are not 
equalized. It conforms to the prediction of model, saying that 
higher signal level enhances the signal to noise ratio and 
reduces the error of transmitted symbols. Symbol error rates of 
all 16 channels comparing to simulation results are shown in 
Figure 5.  
In Figure 5, one might observe that below 70 meters two

acoustic channel, and mode 3 and 4 are the most dominated 
modes. One note that, differ from the background case, the 
acoustic energy diffused to the shallower so that the main 
signature of depth distribution of acoustical energy would 
appear in mode 3 and 4.  
Mode 4 in Figure 8, possesses 32% of energy flux, is the 
most dominated mode and mode 3, possesses 29% of energy 
flux, is expressed as the secondary dominated mode. These two 
modes, totally have over 60%, would make the vertical 
distribution of signal energy well described by these two 
modes.

Figure 8 The estimated mode amplitudes and the local mode function of mode 
3 and 4 at the location of receiving array. 
 
Figure 8 also shows the local mode functions of mode 3 and 
4. The thick-solid curve and thin-dash curve respectively 
represent mode 4 and mode 3. Hydrophones are denoted as the 
pink dots and green ones on mode 4 and 3. 
Ch5-9 residing at the first crest of local mode 4, possess 
higher energy than any other modes, give the lower symbol 
errors in data. This observation also reveals in the simulation 
results so that the depths among 55-70m the symbols stably 
hold at errors of ~12%. The reason for explaining the non 
error-free occur among this segment of depths, is that, though 
these depths residing at the first crest of mode 4 make the 
signal energy enhanced, but the other weak modes would also 
influence these depths so that the symbols could not certainly 
reduce to error free. These weaker modes contribute to the 
constructive or destructive interference.  
Ch9-11(also notice the modeling results among 70-85m), 
following Figure 8, are crossing the first node of local mode 4, 
so that at node the signal level carried by mode 4 diminishes to 
be zero, symbol errors in the meanwhile reach a climax due to 
the weakest signal energy.  
For depths below 80m, the magnitude of mode 3 is slightly 
higher than that of mode 4 shown in Figure 8, this means, as 
the mode amplitudes of mode 3 and 4 are qualitatively the 
same, mode 3 seems to become the dominated mode in the 
lower depths. For ch11-13, they also follow the magnitude of 
mode 4 but more accurately follow the magnitude of mode 3, 
gives that the signal energy, from first peak crosses the first 
node of mode 3 to the second peak, so that the symbol errors 
raise to the local highest at node than descend to the local 
minimum (error free) at the second peak of mode function. 
Symbol errors seem not to disobey the magnitude of mode 4, 
track the second crest of mode 4, across the node, then to the 
third crest.   
Note that at these channels they possess high signal peak 
value, yet not improve the symbol performances, this means, 
performance of symbols, nevertheless, not solely depends on 
the signal level of depths which channels carries. From 
predicted functions of channel impulse response mentioned 
above, even though higher peak values reveal in the middle 
water column, the performance would not be expected to be 
good in simulation results. The reason pointed out is the 
destructive effects of multiple paths on symbols as mentioned 
above. 
Higher signal level would never be the unique explanation 
for improving the performance of symbols, since destructive or 
constructive multiple paths play a role of domination of 
symbol interference. In a point of view of mode propagation to 
look at the destructive and constructive interference, they are 
manifested by the interferences of modal arrivals and modal 
structures. Take Ch1-4 (for depths of 40-60m) to be illustrated, 
they are all resided at the low magnitude both of mode 4 and 3, 
the other modes, i.e., mode 1, 6, 7 and 9, which have higher 
magnitudes of mode function in these depths, also appear at 
VLA and their amplitudes possess certain energy flux (of > 
5%), would doubtless interfere and disturb received signals ay 
these channels. This makes the symbols be fluctuated by the 
other modes, and these modes could not be ignored since they 
might have very high magnitude of modal function even lower 
amplitudes appear. Similarly for Ch14-16, the fluctuations are 
interpreted as the interactions of the other modes which have 
low amplitude but high magnitude of mode function.  
3) Case of internal waves on shelf break: As nonlinear 
internal waves propagate via shelf break, they re-squeeze the 
sound channel, so that the sound energy coupled from mode 3 
and 4 to the other higher modes, and mainly focus on mode 8.  
From the predicted results, the performances of demodulated 
symbols in this case are also low-grade. Also for simplifying 
the layout of printed pages, Figure 9 displays the symbol-error 
curve of received data and compares to the simulation results. 
One could also proclaim that two curves follow the same 
oscillation, that is to say, data results are qualitatively the same 
as observations shown in simulated results.  
Notice the output of symbols in the middle water column in 
Figure 9, at specific depths of 40-50m, 60-70m, and 80-90m, 
predicted ones are descending to the error free. But for depths 
of 70-80m, (only ch8 deployed among these depths), symbols 
with the result that most symbols spread out of the decision 
plane, make the symbol errors in modeling and data reach a 
local climax. This observation also conforms to those of data 
(for ch5 and11, the low symbol errors appear, but for ch8, error 
reaches the climax). The reason pointed out for explaining 
better performances of symbols at these specific depths and the 
abruptly deteriorated performance at ch8, could be conceived 
of the acoustic modal space.  
Figure 10 shows the estimated mode amplitudes for the 
acoustical channel invaded by the nonlinear internal waves via 
shelf break. Modes 1-16 are also displayed and one might 
observe that many modes were generated and excited due to 
9 
 
summed over the receivers. Symbols for one sequence or for 
greater than one sequence, are sampled to create the symbol 
constellation plot, and error performances are displayed.  
The results are first shown with the equalization of each 
single channel based on PPC with three different cases: the 
background case, the case of internal waves propagating via 
slope, and the case of self break.  
Figure 11 shows the constellation plots of the received 
symbols using single channel based on PPC and compare to the 
plots of symbols only with quadrature demodulation at CH9 
and CH15. The right column shows the symbols based on PPC, 
and one might observe that at CH9, differ from the result with 
quadrature demodulation, the symbols cluster appear into two 
circular areas even if only one channel is based on PPC, but 
many symbols still remain spread in the out layers. As 
mentioned above, the performance of symbols with quadrature 
demodulation at CH15, is easily recognized (error rate of ~1%) 
even without any equalization, but after PPC, the variance on 
Q-channel seems to slightly reduce. For rule of BPSK symbol 
decision, the data at CH9 based on equalization of PPC have 
symbol error rate of ~5.6%, which is better than that of ~18% 
appeared without PPC. To minimize the bit-error rate, the first 
is to use more receivers. 
 
Figure 11 Comparison of the symbol constellation between the single channel 
demodulation and single channel PPC in the background case. 
 
Similarly, Figure 12 shows the constellation plots of the 
received symbols using single channel based on PPC in the 
case of internal waves on slope and compare to the plots of 
symbols only with quadrature demodulation at CH8 and CH16. 
The right column shows the symbols based on PPC, and one 
might observe that at CH8, differ from the result with 
quadrature demodulation, the symbols cluster appear into two 
circular areas even if only one channel is based on PPC, but 
many symbols also remain spread in the out layers.  
As displayed above, the performance of symbols with 
quadrature demodulation at any channel is not easily 
recognized without using equalizers, but after PPC, the 
variance on Q-channel could reduce and a clearer clustering of 
the symbols into two circular areas would be observed. For 
rule of BPSK symbol decision, the data at CH8 based on PPC 
have symbol error rate of ~4%, which is better than that of 
~17% appeared without PPC. Similarly, to minimize the bit-
error rate, more receivers are used. 
Figure 13 shows the constellation plots of the received 
symbols using single channel based on PPC in the case of shelf 
break and compare to the plots of symbols only with 
quadrature demodulation at CH3 and CH16. The right column 
shows the symbols based on PPC, and one might observe that 
both at CH3 and CH16, differ from the result with quadrature 
demodulation, the symbols cluster appear into two circular 
areas even if only one channel is based on PPC, few symbols 
spread in the out layers.
