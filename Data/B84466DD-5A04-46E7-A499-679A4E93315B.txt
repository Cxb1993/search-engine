2the contractor of the freedom to allocate resources from job to job and may force the
contractor to use more expensive alternatives. The importance of the total float of an
activity has been explained by many studies (Garza et al. 1991; Callahan et al. 1992;
Bartholomew 1998); however, since the total consumption of float does not affect the finish
date of the project, owners and contractors tend to ignore its potential effect on the project’s 
overall cost.
The impact of float loss on a project’s cost is one of the most complicated factors to assess.
Zafer and Sameh (2007) used the MSAT (multiple simulation and analysis technique) to
quantify the impact of float loss on project duration and cost; least-squares nonlinear
regression converts the stochastic results into a polynomial function that quantifies the impact
by relating the value of the float loss directly to project duration and cost at a specified
confidence level. Woodworth and Shanahan (1988) proposed an algorithm to create
resource-constrained links between activities to show resource dependencies in the network.
Unlike previous studies that have tended to quantify the impact of project changes based
on each activity’s resource level, this study uses a genetic algorithms (G.A.) optimization
model to assess the impact of project changes based on the resource allocation of the whole
project. Following a project change, the model simulates the effects of the change on the
optimal resource allocation and quantifies the cost increase caused by the changes.
2 Literature Review
2.1 Project Management Operational Research
Project management has become a professional domain receiving growing attention in
the past decades and many useful models are developed for supporting project planning works
such as project scheduling and budgeting. In addition, many operational research (OR)
techniques have been adopted to support project management (Tavares 2002). One of the
most OR applications on project management is the resource-constrained project scheduling
problem (RCPSP), which has become a standard problem for project scheduling in the
literature (Hartmann and Briskorn 2010). However, since the common objective of RCPSP
is to minimize the completion time of the project when resources are scarce, the
considerations of project cost as well as the production economics were not sufficiently
addressed.
The economic theory of production concerns the optimal utilization of inputs so that
the output can be maximized and the maximum profit can be obtained. A production process
is considered efficient if the resulting quantity of output reaches the highest level. Since a
project generally comprises a fixed budget and tasks to be done, the efficient production
process is considered as the optimal resources allocation and the minimum production cost, so
as to maximize the profit. Relative to the concept of production economics, the resource
availability cost problem (RACP) has been proposed as another important OR topic, which
4best ways to determine what really occurs day to day on a project (Kartam 1999; Stumpf
2000).
Major schedule impact analysis techniques include: (1) total time or as planned versus
as-built;(2) what-if or impacted as-planned;(3) but-for or collapsed as-built; (4) window,
snapshot, or contemporaneous period analysis; and (5) time impact analysis. Each technique
may have several variants. Different techniques may yield inconsistent results for a given
circumstance and may not be universally applied (Bubshait and Cunningham 1998; Hegazy
and Zhang 2005). In addition, none of these techniques adequately addresses resource
alocation in “after-the-fact” schedule delay analysis. The need to reflect and capture the
practice of resource allocation in schedule analysis is apparent and imperative (Ibbs and
Nguyen 2007).
3 The Proposed Model
In this research, the G.A. optimization model, which can optimize the allocation of
resources in keeping with the project schedule, is adopted to build the optimal schedule and
cost impact analysis.
This research has the following assumptions:
1. Contract duration is pre-fixed and time-cost trade-off is not included.
2. Projects are performed in optimal working sequences and the following optimization
process doesn’t change the relationship between activities.
3. The workload for each activity will not change during the optimization process.
4. For a specific task, there is a substitution relationship between two different types of
resources with work productivity loss.
5. There are unlimited resources available for the project and there are idle costs for
standby resources and costs for resource mobilizations and demobilizations.
6. Activities in the CPM diagram can not be split and the resource rates are uniform
throughout each activity’s duration.
The chromosome of the G.A. optimization model is based on the activity level. Each
activity (activity k, k = 1---n) contains several types of tasks (task I, I = 1---n ), each task
needs several types of resources ( Rj, j = 1---n ), each resource consists of several gene cells,
and the cell value is designated to be between 0 and 1. The chromosome for each activity is as
shown in Fig. 1.

The GA optimization process begins with the early-start schedule and then shifts the
non-critical activities within the time span of the total float by allowing the gene values to
8resources plan viable for the real world situation by reducing the times of mobilization and
demobilization.

Fig. 4 shows the bar-chart comparisons between the optimal schedule and the early-start
schedule. As shown in the TF column, after the optimization process, in the non-critical
path B-E-H-I-K-M-O-Q with TF=9, activities O and Q defer the start date for 3 days, while
activities B, E, H, I, K, and M retain the same start date as in the early-start schedule. In the
non-critical path D-G-L-N-R with TF=23, the start date of activities D, G, L and R defers for
11 days, and only activity R defers for 19 days.

optimization of project resources, an after-impact schedule is developed. The impact on
project duration and cost can be determined by comparing the before/after impact schedule.
Assume that a disruption of work causes the delay of the start day of activity D to day
16. The optimization results show that the total cost of this delay will be $6,973,900, which is
1.8% more than the cost of original optimal schedule. The cost difference and variance
between the optimal schedule (before-impact) and the after-impact schedule are easily
identified from the S-curve. In addition, as mentioned before, activity D has 10 days optimal
float and thus, any delay within the time span of the optimal float will not cause any change in
project cost. However, once the delay lasts beyond day 10, the original optimal schedule
becomes null and an after-impact optimal schedule has to be developed to allow the continued
execution of the project. If the original optimal start date is interrupted, the after-impact
optimal start date for activity D is day 21 instead of day 16. The updated after-impact optimal
schedule with its set of brand new start and finish dates for each activity (as shown in Table 5)
can be conveniently identified through the optimization process.
