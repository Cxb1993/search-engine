4cell under direct internal reforming conditions. They used a model to study the
influences of various operating parameters on cell performance, such as the air flow
rate, anode thickness, steam to carbon ratio, specific area, and pre-reforming. Their
results indicate that the efficiency of the fuel cell itself is higher for pre-formed fuel
compared to non-reformed fuel. Araki et al. [8] investigated a power generation
system consisting of two-staged SOFCs with serial connection of low and high
temperature SOFCs. Their results show that the power generation efficiency of the
two-staged SOFCs is a little higher than that by high-temperature SOFC only.
Bedogni et al [9] presents an experimental analysis of circular-planar type
intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells, and the interpretation of the
experimental results with a finite volume model, which is calibrated and validated
over experimental voltage-current data. The comparison between the model and
experiment demonstrates the capacity of the model to predict the cell behavior and
overall energy balances when changing significantly the cell operating conditions.
Achenbach [10] presented a three-dimensional simulation for the gas, current
density, and temperature distribution of a planar solid oxide fuel cell, which accounts
for time-dependent effect, flow configurations, internal methane-steam reforming, and
recycling of the fuel. Recknagle et al. [11] simulated a three-dimensional SOFC unit
with three kinds of flow patterns using the same commercial package used by [3] for
reaction area performance. The authors showed temperature, current density, and
fuel composition distribution with three flow configurations, i.e. co-flow, counter-flow,
and cross-flow. Their results indicated that the co-flow had the most uniform
temperature distribution and smallest thermal gradients. Beale et al. [12]
investigated three different numerical method approaches for solving a unit and a
ten-stack SOFC with cross-flow. Results indicated that the direct numerical method
is the most accurate single cell method. Simpler approaches can potentially supplant
or complement the direct numerical method in fuel cell stack analysis. Iwata et al.
[13] established a numerical program to estimate temperature and current density
profiles of a planar-type SOFC unit with co-flow, counter-flow, and cross-flow. That
study investigated gas re-circulation ratio, operating pressure, and physical property
effects on current and temperature distributions. Recently, Wang et al [14]
constructs a fully three-dimensional mathematical model for planar
porous-electrode-supported SOFC to simulate the steady state electrochemical
characteristics and multi-species/heat transport. Their results indicate that the fuel
and air flow is progressively heated up along with the flow direction, and the mass
transport resistance of species in the porous anode under higher fuel utilization is
dominant in lowering the cell performance.
The flow configuration of a SOFC is similar to that of a heat exchanger,
regardless of whether the flow configuration is co-flow, counter-flow or cross-flow.
Because the fuel and air need manifolds to lead them into each stack, and distributors
to assign the gases to channels in each stack, manifold position and distributor
geometry influence flow rate distribution in the inlet section. Flow rate pattern in
both the frontal entrance area and stacking direction are therefore nonuniform in
practice. Costamagna et al. [15] investigated nonuniform mass flow distribution in
the stacking direction of a fuel cell with 100 stacks. Boersma and Sammes [16]
considered a nonuniform gas flow distribution in the stacking direction along a solid
oxide fuel cell stack system height, and employed a hydraulic resistance network to
insight this distribution. Recently, Okada et al. [17] proposed a large-scale stack
divided into four blocks from the point of view of the gas flow scheme in order to
supply gas to each stack uniformly in a solid oxide fuel cell, and this method can
6This study considers the reformed methane or ethanol in the external reformer
and the reforming gases are fed into the SOFC, i.e. the feed fuel includes hydrogen
(H2), nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and water (H2O).

2.1.2 Mass balance equations
Flow through fuel and air channels can be assumed to be one-dimensional and
laminar, i.e. plug flow, so this study takes the conservation of mass for each species
molar flow rate change in fuel and air with species consumption linking the local
current density.

Meanwhile, L is the length of cell with the subscript of x or y, n is the molar flow
rate, jX is the mole fraction of j-component, and the plus/minus symbol represents
molar flow rate increase or decrease dependent on reactant or product species. i is
the current density, and F is the Faraday constant (96485 A s mol-1). In Eq. (4),
fuel reactants and products include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and
water. The reactant and product in air only includes oxygen in Eq. (5). The
superscript k stands for the stack number.
2.2.3 Energy balance equations
This study takes the conservation of energy for fuel, air, cell, and the
inter-connector for each stack. It is noted that the inter-connector for energy
conservation combines the inter-connector flowing with the air and the
inter-connector flowing with the fuel in the next stack. Therefore, the
inter-connector temperature will affect the adjacent gas and cell temperature in the
next stack, as well as couples the temperature interaction in the whole stack. The
energy conservation for the fuel, air, cell, and inter-connector are as following.

Meanwhile, 0E is the ideal voltage for hydrogen oxidization under the standard
pressure. This study considers voltage loss caused by electrolyte ohmic polarization,
electrode activation polarization, and concentration polarization. Because
concentration polarization in the cathode is less than that in the anode when the SOFC
cell is electrolyte-supported and anode-supported, this study neglects concentration
polarization in the cathode [23]. Therefore, cell voltage is equal to the Nernst
voltage by subtracting the polarization of ohmic, activation, and concentration in
anode as follows.

Here, r is 30010-7Ω/m2 [24], anodei ,0 and cathodei ,0 are 1290 and 970 A/m2 [25],
respectively, the anode is 0.05mm, and anodeD is 210-5 m/s [26]. The solving
method for above governing equations in a SOFC unit has been developed in my
previous research [20], and the method uses mass balance equations and energy
balance equations to solve the mole faction of each species, and the fuel, the air, the
cell, and the inter-connector temperature, respectively. Then, the solving method
calculates the current density by Eqs. (16)-(19), based on assuming the cell voltage to
be uniform over the cell reaction area.
3. Numerical Methods
This study uses a finite difference method to solve the governing equations in the
stack by stack. For each stack, there are four two-dimensional calculation domains
with same area of 0.2×0.2 m2. Every calculation domains are divided into N×N
subdivisions, and the inlet and exit of fuel and the air subdivisions are assigned the
calculation nodes of the gas molar flow rate and temperature. Moreover, this study
assigned the calculation nodes of cell temperature and current density in the center of
the cell subdivisions, and assigned the calculation nodes of inter-connector
temperature in the center of the inter-connector subdivision. Author discretizes the
Eqs. (4) to (9) to finite difference equations by an implicit scheme and the above node
arrangement. Then, this paper builds a Fortran code to solve gas molar flow rate of
each species in the fuel and the air, the temperatures of the fuel, the air, the cell, and
the inter-connector, as well as the current density, which are the variables in the finite
difference equations. The calculation proceeds as follows 1) The program guesses a
uniform current density distribution and solves the molar flow rate of each species in
the fuel and the air using Eqs. (4) and (5) in the first stack. 2) The program solves
the temperature fields of the fuel, the air, the cell, and the inter-connector using Eqs.
(6) to (9), respectively, in the same stack. 3) Calculate the Nernst voltage by Eq. (14)

in this figure is similar to that in Fig. 3(a), which has both uniform inlet fuel and air
flow. Because the air dominates the temperature distribution due to its larger molar
flow rate comparing to that of the fuel, the contour in Fig. 3(c) is close to that in Fig.
3(a). Although the non-uniform inlet fuel flow slightly affects the temperature
contour in Fig. 3(c), the progressively increasing profile of inlet molar flow rate
induce a little lower temperature about 5 C on the bottom stack comparing to that
in Fig. 3(a). This temperature drop is induced by the less reaction heat caused the
lower molar flow rate of the fuel. Figure 3(d) depicts the temperature distribution on
the exit and top faces of the SOFC stack in Pattern IV, which has both non-uniform
inlet molar flow of fuel and air. According to the above mentions, the air dominates
the cell temperature distribution and the effect of non-uniform inlet molar flow rate of
fuel is ignored, so it is clear that the contour in Fig. 3(d) is close to that in Fig. 3(b)
because of the same non-uniform air flow. The little difference between Fig. 3(d)
and 3(b) is that the cell temperatures near the bottom stack, because the non-uniform
inlet molar flow rate of the fuel induces less reaction heat due to the lower fuel flow
in the bottom stack.
This study calculates the current density distribution in each stack when the cell
voltage in each stack is assumed to be constant and the stacks are connected in
parallel connection. Figure 4 shows the current density contour on the faces of exit
and top faces in the SOFC stack when the deviation of inlet molar flow rate in the
stacking direction is 0.5. In this figure, it is clear that the outline of these contours in
Pattern I and Pattern II are similar, and so are those in Pattern III and Pattern IV.
Pattern I and Pattern II have same inlet molar flow rate of the fuel, but different inlet
molar flow rate of the air. Comparing Fig. 4(a) to 4(b) indicates that the
non-uniform inlet molar flow rate of the air slightly affects the current density
distribution in a SOFC stack, it only raise current density on the top stack and drop it
on the bottom stack. Examining the difference of average current density in each
stack between the Pattern I and Pattern II indicates that all the change rates of the
average current density in every stack are below 0.5%. Therefore, the effect of
non-uniform inlet flow rate of the air in the stacking direction on the electrical
performance of a SOFC stack is ignored. The current density contours of Pattern III
and Pattern IV are similar to each other in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), and the change rate of
the average current density in each stack respected to those of Pattern I are over 5%
through author’s inspection. Because the Pattern III and Pattern IV have the same
inlet condition of non-uniform molar flow rate of the fuel, the effect of the fuel
non-uniform inlet flow in the stacking direction on the electrical performance of a
SOFC stack is stronger than the effect of the air non-uniform inlet flow. Comparing
the Figs. 4(c) to 4(d) shows that the non-uniform inlet molar flow rate of the air little
affects the current density distribution as in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), and it raises the
current density on the top stack and drops that on the bottom stack. Examining the
contours of the current density in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) indicates that the current density
increases along the stacking direction. The average current density increases from
3574 2/ mA on the bottom stack to 4171 2/ mA on the top stack in Pattern IV, and
it has change rate of 15%. It is noted that the more flow rate of the fuel will keep a
higher concentration of hydrogen and produce a higher current density. The
non-uniform inlet molar flow rate of the fuel in this study is progressively increasing
from the bottom to the top, so the current density will rise to a higher value because of
more fuel flow as well as the current density drops to a lower one due to the less fuel.
In a fuel cell, the molar flow rate of fuel is always restricted for reducing the waste of
hydrogen, so the manifold design for producing uniform inlet flow in the stacking

temperature and isolated boundary conditions. The effect of non-uniform inlet flow
of the fuel on the variation of current density in parallel connection or on the variation
of cell voltage in serial connection are both close to 15 % in the Pattern III and IV.
On the other hand, the air dominates the temperature field of a SOFC stack, and the
non-uniform inlet molar flow rate of the air affects nearly 3% variation rate of the
average cell temperature among different stacks. Although the effect of non-uniform
inlet molar flow rate does not affect the total power of the SOFC stack, the variation
rate of average cell temperature and cell voltage is close to 3% and 15%, respectively.
This non-uniform effect in the stacking direction is apparently larger than that in the
transverse direction, which has investigated in our previous research.

三、計畫成果自評
（ㄧ）優點
1. 本計畫已經完成固態氧化物燃料電池堆三維熱電性能分析，並已經將此研究
成果發表於 2nd International Conference on Advanced Computational
Engineering and Experimenting
2. 在定溫條件之研究成果也發表於第 15 屆全國計算流體力學會議。
3. 本計畫之整體成果也已經投 Journal of Power Sources，且已經被接受。
4. 本計畫確實依照原計畫內容進行，並獲得良好成果。
（二）待改進
1.由於此一計畫原來申請三年期，但是經過評審後改為一年期。因此原計畫中之
第二部份「即時反饋控制模型之建構」無法進行。
2.由於主持人所任職的單位為一般技術學院，目前並無研究生。在很多計畫中需
要協助部分ㄧ般四技生無法勝任，以至於需主持人本身自行處理。雖然研究
之專精度不受影響，但此一現象使研究的廣度大受影響。
3.建議評審能審慎了解對於技職校院從事研究之資源匱乏下而有不錯之研究成
果的學者給予不同的標準（不能以一般研究型大學研究速度相比），使其能有
國科會的補助進行完整的研究規劃。
