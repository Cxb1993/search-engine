Abstract 
A new polymer/surfactant system, the poly(N-vinylformamide) (PNVF)/lithium 
perfluorononanoate (LiPFN) system, has been studied by a combination of the surface tension 
method and two-dimensional 1H-19F heteronuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy (2D 
1H-19F HOESY).  Using the surface tension method, we found that the critical aggregation 
concentration (cac) of LiPFN in the presence of PNVF is ca. 2 mM.  In addition, the association 
behavior between LiPFN and PNVF is similar to that between poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and 
LiPFN.  The supramolecular structure of the PNVF-LiPFN complex in the aqueous phase is 
revealed by means of the 2D 1H-19F HOESY experiment.  On the basis of the intermolecular 
cross-relaxation between the PNVF protons and the LiPFN fluorines, we could conclude that the 
PNVF chain do penetrate into the LiPFN aggregate.  The semi-quantitative analysis of the 
internuclear distance indicates that the PNVF chain is not located at the center core of the LiPFN 
aggregate, but the PNVF chain thread itself through the surface shell of the LiPFN aggregate 
instead.  PNVF protons are nearest to the fluorines next to the carboxyl group, suggesting that 
the interaction between PNVF and LiPFN is mainly due to the dipole-ionic attraction.  Moreover, 
we have reinvestigated the supramolecular structure of PVP-LiPFN complex and have found that 
the PVP chain also penetrates into the LiPFN aggregate.  In contrast with the PNVF-LiPFN 
complex, the PVP chain in the PVP-LiPFN complex is rather close to the middle part of the 
LiPFN molecules which constitute the polymer-bound aggregate.  This indicates that the 
formation of PVP-LiPFN complex involves more or less fluorophilic interactions.

dodecyl sulfate (PEO-SDS),9,10 poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-SDS (PVP-SDS),11 PVP-sodium decyl 
sulfate (PVP-C10OS),12 and poly(vinylformamide)-SDS (PNVF-SDS),13 have been proven to 
belong to the Type II structure. 
A variety of spectroscopic techniques, including small angle neutron scattering (SANS),3 
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR),14 and NMR paramagnetic relaxation,9 have been applied 
to elucidate the supramolecular structure composed of different types of polymers and 
surfactants.  Recently, the two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy (2D 
NOESY) has been proven as a prominent molecular technique to provide insight into molecular 
features of surfactant micelles and macromolecule-surfactant complexes.10,12,13,15-23  It is unlike 
EPR and NMR paramagnetic relaxation, the addition of a third non-native probe to the 
polymer/surfactant mixture is not required for the 2D NOESY NMR experiment.  In a 2D 
NOESY spectrum, the presence of cross-peaks directly provides proximity on two nuclei of 
interest located within about 5 Å of each other.  It is thus possible to distinguish whether the 
polymer chain penetrates into the micelle-like surfactant aggregate.  Taking the PNVF/SDS 
system13 as an example, the PNVF protons have cross-relaxation with the terminal methyl 
protons of SDS, giving distinct NOESY cross-peaks between them; therefore, it ensures that the 
PNVF polymer chain penetrate through the SDS aggregate.  On the other hand, if the polymer 
chain does not penetrate through the surfactant aggregate, no NOESY cross-peak will be found 
between the polymer and the surfactant.20 
Perfluorinated surfactants, which are composed of fully fluorinated carbons as the 
hydrophobic moiety, possess unique surface active properties compared to hydrocarbon-based 
surfactants.  Although the polymer/hydrogenated surfactant systems have been extensively 
studied, only limited studies of few polymer/perfluorinated surfactant systems have been 
 6
mM.  Fluorine nuclei (19F) is a good isotope for NMR analysis of the polymer/surfactant system 
containing the perfluorinated surfactant; therefore, we apply the 2D 1H-19F HOESY experiment 
to investigate the supramolecular structure of the PNVF-LiPFN complex.  Considering the 
association behavior between PNVF and SDS is similar to that between PVP and SDS, we also 
reinvestigate the PVP/LiPFN system using the 2D 1H-19F HOESY experiment.  Moreover, by 
taking advantage of the well-resolved 19F resonance peaks in the 2D spectra, the penetration 
depth of the polymer chain in the LiPFN aggregate can be semi-quantitatively determined. 
 
Experimental Section 
Materials.  N-vinylformamide (NVF, Aldrich, 98%) was purified by distillation under reduced 
pressure prior to polymerization.  Perfluorononanoic acid and lithium hydroxide were purchased 
from Fluka.  Poly(vinylformamide) (MW = 88,000) was prepared as stated in our previous work.  
Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (MW = 40,000) was purchased from Aldrich. 
Preparation of Lithium Perfluorononanoate (LiPFN).  The procedure for transformation of 
perfluorononanoic acid to its corresponding lithium salt is based on the steps in ref. 39.  
Perfluorononanoic acid (3.00 g, 6.46 mmol) was dissolved in 5 ml ethanol.  In another round 
bottom flask, an equimolar amount of lithium hydroxide was dissolved by adding 5 ml deionized 
water.  The two solutions were mixed and stirred at 45°C for one hour.  The mixture was 
concentrated by evaporation to a small volume of ca. 2.5 mL, and then 5 mL of hot ethanol were 
added into the mixture.  The solution was concentrated again to ca. 2.5 mL, and then the lithium 
salt was precipitated by adding 45 mL chloroform to this concentrated solution.  The salt was 
filtered and redissolved in ethanol, and then recrystallized following the above procedure.  The 
final product was dried and stored in a vacuum desiccator.

from the plot of surface tension vs surfactant concentration in the presence of polymer.  First, the 
surface tension of aqueous PNVF/LiPFN mixtures stop decreasing at [LiPFN] = 2 mM, which is 
considered as the cac of LiPFN in the presence of 5 g/L PNVF.  The cac marks the onset of 
cooperative binding of LiPFN molecules to the polymer.  It should be noted that the cac of 
LiPFN (2 mM) of the PNVF/LiPFN system is higher than the reported value (0.9 mM) of the 
PVP/LiPFN system with the polymer concentration of 1 wt%.27  Second, at surfactant 
concentrations between 2 and 10 mM, we see a surface tension plateau.  In the plateau 
concentration range the added surfactant molecules are bound onto the polymer chains, rather 
than are absorbed at the air-water interface; consequently, the surface tension keeps as a constant 
value of 29 mN/m.  The surface tension starts to decrease again as [LiPFN] is higher than 10 mM, 
the maximum binding concentration of surfactant at which polymer chains in the solution are 
saturated with LiPFN aggregates. 
From the maximum binding concentration of PNVF (10 mM) and the PNVF 
concentration of 5 g/L (70.4 mM for the NVF repeating unit), we calculate a biding ratio 
LiPNF/PNVF-monomer of 0.14 (one surfactant per seven monomer units).  For the LiPFN/PVP 
system, the biding ratio LiPNVF/PVP-monomer is 0.12 (one surfactant per eight monomer 
unit).27  The above results obtained by the surface tension method indicate that the association 
behavior between PNVF and LiPFN is very similar to that between PVP and LiPFN. 
1H and 19F NMR characterization.  The one-dimensional 1H and 19F spectra and assignments 
of chemical shifts for the PNVF (5 g/L)/LiPFN (20 mM)/D2O and PVP (10 g/L)/LiPFN (18 
mM)/D2O mixtures are shown in Figure 3 and 4, respectively.  Note that the 19F chemical shifts 
are referenced to the fluorine resonance of α, α, α-trifluorotoluene at -63.73 ppm.

Supramolecular Structure of the PNVF-LiPFN Complex from 2D 1H-19F HOESY NMR.  
To gain insight into the molecular interactions and the microstructure of the polymer-surfactant 
complex, we have performed 2D 1H-19F HOESY experiments.  The cross-peaks presenting in the 
2D HOESY spectrum warrant that the spatial distance between a 1H-19F pair of interest is less 
than 5Å.  Figure 5a shows the 2D 1H-19F HOESY spectrum of the PNVF (5 g/L)/LiPFN (20 
mM)/D2O mixture.    All polymer/surfactant systems that have been studied so far show a slow 
buildup of intermolecular NOE.  On the basis of the slow buildup of intermolecular 1H-1H NOE 
between PNVF and SDS and to take account of the smaller heteronuclear 1H-19F NOE, the 
mixing time used in the study is set to 800 ms.  It should be noted that at the concentration of 
LiPFN below its regular cmc, no cross-peaks were found in the 2D HOESY spectrum, indicating 
that LiPFN and PNVF molecules are not in close vicinity at such low concentration of LiPFN. 
Figure 5a illustrates the 2D 1H-19F HOESY spectrum for the PNVF/LiPFN system, and 
the 1D slices in the 1H dimension (ω1), which are extracted along the 19F (ω2) dimension at the 
maximum of each proton resonance peak of PNVF are shown in Figure 5b~d.  It is apparent 
from Figure 5a and 5b that NβH protons of PNVF show cross-peaks with all fluorine nuclei of 
LiPFN, evidencing close spatial proximities (< 5Å) between PNVF and LiPFN.  Furthermore, 
the appearance of intermolecular HOESY peaks between F9 and all PNVF protons indicates that 
the PNVF polymer chains do penetrate through the LiPFN aggregate rather than only surround 
on the outer surface of the aggregate. 
Since the well-resolved 19F peaks spread over a large chemical range in the 2D HOESY 
spectrum, to examine the relative spatial distances of different 1H-19F pairs in the PNVF-LiPFN 
complex becomes possible.  The peak volume of a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum can 
qualitatively reflect the internuclear distance; however, the intensity of the cross-peak must be 
 12
negligible as compared with the intense F2-NCHO cross-peak (see Figure 5d).  However, there 
are distinct cross-peaks from F8 and F9 fluorines and NCHO.  The peak intensity F3-NCHO 
should be stronger than that of F9-NCHO and F8-NCHO cross-peaks if the later two cross-peaks 
were due to spin diffusion.  With these data, the possibility of spin diffusion along 
perfluorocarbon chain can thus be excluded. 
Supramolecular Structure of the PVP-LiPFN Complex from 2D 1H-19F HOESY NMR.  
PVP has long presented as a prime and thoroughly reviewed model polymer for investigation of 
polymer/surfactant systems.  As mentioned in the introduction, the supramolecular structures of 
PVP-SDS and PNVF-SDS complexes are like the Type II structure.  Nevertheless, Segre et al. 
showed that the data from the 1H and 19F chemical shifts indicated the PVP-LiPFN complex as 
the Type I structure.29  However, the forementioned results obtained from the surface tension 
method have indicated that the association behavior between LiPFN and polymer in the 
PNVF/LiPFN system resembles that of the PVP/LiPFN system.  Therefore, we reinvestigate the 
PVP-LiPFN complex with a direct molecular approach (2D 1H-19F HOESY), and compare the 
discrepancy between the PVP-LiPFN and PNVF-LiPFN complexes. 
The 2D HOESY spectrum of the PVP (5 g/L)/LiPFN (18 mM)/D2O mixture with 800 ms 
mixing time are shown in Figure 6a, and the cross sections taken from VβH, V3H, V4H and 
VαH along 19F dimension are shown in Figure 6b~e.  Unfortunately, spectral resolution in the 
proton dimension (ω1) is very poor so that only the cross-peak volume due to V4H (the ring 
methylene protons next to nitrogen) and VαH (the backbone methine proton) are measurable.  
The data in Table 2 show that the corrected cross-peak intensities from F4~7 of LiPFN between 
the ring proton V4H and the backbone proton VαH are much stronger than those from F2 and F9.  
This indicates that the polymer chain is relatively close to the middle part of the LiPFN 
 14
 
Conclusion 
We have used the surface tension and 2D 1H-19F HOESY NMR techniques to investigate 
the new polymer/perfluorinated surfactant system, the PNVF/LiPFN system.  The cac (ca. 2 mM) 
of LiPFN in the presence of PNVF has been determined using the surface tension method.  The 
binding ratio LiPNF/PNVF-monomer is 0.14, i.e. one surfactant per seven monomer units.  In 
terms of the results obtained by the surface tension method, the association behavior between 
PNVF and LiPFN is very similar to that between PVP and LiPFN, except for that a lower cac of 
LiPFN (0.9 mM) for the PVP/LiPFN system.  Therefore, we have also reinvestigated the 
PVP/LiPFN system by NMR spectroscopy.  The broad 1H and 19F resonance peaks indicate that 
the conformational motion of PVP chain is strongly hampered due to the planar ring by 
neighboring with LiPFN molecules.  The slow motion of the PVP chain might account for the 
lower cac of LiPNF in the presence of PVP.  On the basis of the 2D 1H-19F HOESY NMR 
analysis, we have concluded that both polymers penetrate into the interior of the LiPFN 
aggregate.  The PNVF chain only threads through the hydrophilic shell of the LiPFN aggregate, 
and association of PNVF with LiPFN is manly originated from the dipole-ionic interaction.  The 
PVP chain crosses the middle part of the LiPFN aggregate, and the fluorophilic interaction is 
involved in complexation of PVP with LiPFN.

爾獎得主：提出「超分子」（supramolecules）概念的1987年諾貝爾獎得主 Jean-Marie 
Lehn 教授，另一位是 2000 年以導電性高分子得到諾貝爾獎的 Alan J. Heeger 教

中，這次會議可以一次邀請到 16 位知名學者共聚一堂，講授他們最新的研究成
果與未來研究方向，每一場演講都非常精彩，讓筆者大呼過癮。 
因為筆者在博士班修業期間曾經在 Mainz 的 MPI for Polymer Research 的
Prof. Dr. Spiess 教授研究室訪問研究過一年，因此藉這次會議的機會重訪舊地。
當年我所認識的Prof. Dr. Spiess教授研究室中的研究成員幾乎全部都已經離開到
其它單位工作，但很多舊識也都藉此會議從德國各地回到 Mainz，大家在會場聊
天敘舊，瞭解近況。因為這次會議的時間還在學期當中，所以無法多待幾日，參
加 MPI 的 reunion，頗為遺憾。 
筆者這次共發表兩篇壁報論文，一篇是有關高分子-界面活性劑交互作用的
研究，另一篇則是利用電紡絲來製作高分子奈米纖維。可惜的是這次參加會議的
學者鮮少有做高分子-界面活性劑交互作用的相關研究，但做高分子奈米纖維則
不少，因此，在壁報展出時，很多人來詢問製作高分子奈米纖維的相關問題。 
以下將與高分子奈米纖維研究領域相關的壁報做一簡單整理：

Interactions between Poly(N-vinylformamide)-Based Copolymers and 
Surfactants in Aqueous Solutions

Poly(N-vinylformamide) (PNVF) is a green and biocompatible polymer 
developed recently to replace poly(acrylamide) (PAAm), whose monomer is known as 
a potential carcinogen.  The repeating units of PNVF and PAAm are structural 
isomers for each other.  It is well known that PAAm does not interact with anionic 
surfactants, whereas we have found that PNVF homopolymer shows significant 
interactions with anionic surfactants.  However, like other uncharged water-soluble 
homopolymers such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and poly(ethylene oxide), there is 
almost no interaction of the PNVF homopolymer with both cationic and nonionic 
surfactants.  In order to increase the interactions between PNVF and cationic and 
nonionic surfactants, in the study we have synthesized two series PNVF-based 
copolymers of poly(N-vinylformamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNVFAA) and 
poly(N-vinylformamide-co-hexadecyl acrylate) (PNVFC16A).  The PNVFAA 
copolymers possess negative charges from the AA units, which can bind strongly with 
the cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonian bromide (CTAB).  The 
NVFAA/CTAB system shows interesting phase behaviors which will vary with the 
amount of AA units in the copolymer.  For the PNVFAA copolymer containing 3 
mol% AA units, the aqueous PNVFAA/CTAB mixture precipitates as [CTAB] ranging 
from 0.6 to 20 mM, while the mixture becomes to a clear solution again as [CTAB] 
higher than 20 mM.  The supramolecule structure of PNVFAA-CTAB complex has 
been elucidated using 2D NOESY NMR.  The hydrophobically modified 
PNVFC16A copolymers contains hydrophobic C16-alkyl group on its side chain.  
Owing to the enhanced hydrophobicity, the PNVFC16A copolymer can interact with 
anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants.  Additionally, the PNVFC16A/surfactant 
aqueous solution show different rheological properties depending on the strength 
between the copolymer and the surfactant.
