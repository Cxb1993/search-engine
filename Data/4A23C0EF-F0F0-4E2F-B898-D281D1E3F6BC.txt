repair interval. This strategy is based on the idea that replacements close 
to the end of the warranty are not in the interest of the manufacturer. 
Nguyen and Murthy [4,5] continued with the idea of splitting the warranty 
period into distinct intervals for repair and replacement. The first warranty 
servicing model, involving minimal repair and assuming constant repair 
and replacement costs, was that of Nguyen [6]. Jack and Murthy [7] 
recently presented a warranty servicing strategy involving minimal repair 
and replacement. The strategy splits the period into two intervals during 
which only repairs are performed, separated by a third interval in which at 
most one replacement is made. For intermediate values of cost ratio of 
replacement versus repair, the expected cost of the new static strategy 
compares favorably with that of the optimal dynamic strategy, as 
determined by Jack and Van der Duyn Aschouten [8].   
   Most of the studies cited here assume that the failure rate function of an 
item increases with the item’s age. Item failure mechanisms and failure 
phenomena have been studied [9]. The life cycle of an item includes 
generally three phases of failure rate. The three phrases are represented as 
a pattern of bathtub curve. Hence, this study applies a bathtub-shaped 
failure rate to describe the new warranty servicing strategy. The cost of 
the i-th minimal repair at age y  is ( ( ), ( ))ig C y c y , where ( )C y  represents an 
age-dependent random part of the cost; ( )ic y  is a deterministic part of the 
cost, which depends on the age and the number of minimal repairs; ( )ic y  
is non-decreasing in i , and g  is a positive non-decreasing and continuous 
function. The general warranty servicing strategy proposed herein again 
involves splitting the warranty period [ ]0,W  into three distinct intervals for 
performing repairs and making a replacement. Section 2 describes the 
model. Section 3 analyzes the model. Section 4 presents the form of the 
optimal strategies.

3. MODEL ANALYSIS 
    The expected total warranty servicing cost per item is represented as a 
function of L  and K , ( , )J K L . The objective is to determine the optimal 
K  and L  that minimize ( , )J K L , subject to the constraints 0 K L W≤ ≤ ≤ . 
An expression for ( , )J K L is devised by subdividing the expected total 
warranty servicing cost per item ( , )J K L  over [ ]0,W  into three parts.   
Consider a non-homogeneous Poisson process { }( ), 0N t t ≥  with intensity

Then, the function ( )G t  on [0, ]W is non-decreasing on [0, 2]W , and non-
increasing on [ 2, ]W W . Moreover, ( )G t reaches its maximum value 
( 2) ( ) 2 ( 2)r h hh W c R W R W− + −  at the point 2t W= . 
PROOF. Differentiating ( )G t  yields

The proof is separated into the following cases. 
Case (1). 10 t t≤ < . The function ( )h t  is non-decreasing on [0, ]W , so 
( ) 0h t′ ≥ . Notably, W t t− ≥ , ( ) ( )h W t h t− ≥  and ( ) ( ) 0r t r W t− − ≤  on 1[0, )t  
by assumption, implying ( ) 0G t′ ≥ . 
Case(2). 1 2t t W≤ < . The function ( )h t  is non-decreasing on [0, ]W  and 
W t t− ≥ , so ( ) ( )h W t h t− ≥ . Notably, 12W t W t− ≥ ≥  and ( )r t  is non-
decreasing in t  for 1t t≥ , implying 1( ) ( ) ( )r W t r t r t− ≥ = . Hence ( ) 0G t′ ≥ .  
Case(3). 2W t W≤ ≤ . Follows ( 2C ), ( ) 0G t′ ≤  on [ 2, ]W W . Accordingly, the 
desired results are obtained. 
LEMMA 3. Suppose that the failure rate function ( )r t  has a bathtub shape 
with change points 1t  and 2t . Moreover, 1 2,t t and ( )r t  satisfy,  
( 1C ) 1 1 2 22 2 2t t t W t W≤ + ≤ ≤ ≤  and  
( 3C ) ( ) ( ) 0r t r W t− − ≤  on 1[0, )t , ( ) ( ) 0r t r W t− − ≥  on 2[ , ]t W , and ( )h t  is 
non-decreasing on [0, ]W  such that ( )h t  is constant on [ 2, ]W W . 
Then, the function ( )G t  is non-decreasing on [0, 2]W , and non-increasing 
on [ 2, ]W W . Moreover, ( )G t reaches its maximum value 
( 2) ( ) 2 ( 2)r h hh W c R W R W− + −  at the point 2t W= . 
PROOF. The proof is separated into the following cases. 
Case (1). 0 2t W≤ ≤ . As the same as the proof in Lemma 2, it is clearly. 
Case(2). 22W t t≤ < . The function ( )h t  is constant on [ 2, ]W W  by 
assumption, so ( ) 0h t′ =  and 2 2W t W W W t− ≤ − = ≤ , implying 
( ) ( )h W t h t− ≤ . Notably, 1 2 22t W t W t W W t t≤ − ≤ − ≤ − ≤ ≤  and ( )r t  is 
constant on [ ]1 2,t t t∈ , implying ( ) ( )r t r W t= − . Hence, ( ) 0.G t′ ≤  
Case(3). 2t t W≤ ≤ . The function ( )h t  is constant on [ 2, ]W W  by 
assumption, so ( ) 0h t′ = . Notably, 2 20 2 2W t W t W W W t t≤ − ≤ − ≤ − = ≤ ≤  
and ( )h t  is non-decreasing in t , implying ( ) ( )h W t h t− ≤ . Also 
( ) ( ) 0r t r W t− − ≥  on 2[ , ]t W  by assumption, ( ) ( )r W t r t− ≤  hence ( ) 0.G t′ ≤  
Accordingly, the desired results are obtained.

two roots in [0, ]b , one at b  and the other at [ , 2]c a W∈ . 
PROOF. Suppose that ( 2) ( ) 2 ( 2) ( )h h rh W R W R W c h W+ − > > ; from Lemma 2 
or 3, the maximum value of ( )G t  is positive, (0) 0,rG c= − < and 
( ) ( ) 0rG W h W c= − < . Therefore, the equation ( ) 0G t =  has two roots, 
(0, 2)a W∈  and ( 2, )b W W∈ . Differentiating (9) yields ( ) ( ) ( )H K G K F K′ ′=  
on [0, ]b . H ′  has the same sign as G′ . Lemma 2 or 3 thus yields the 
desired result ( 1R ). By definition of ( )H K , and from the sign of ( )G t′ ,

Therefore, the desired result ( 2R ) is again obtained. 
 
Accordingly, the following theorem is inferred. 
 
THEOREM 2. Suppose that ( 2) ( ) 2 ( 2) ( )h h rh W R W R W c h W+ − > >  and the 
failure rate function ( )r t  is a bathtub-shaped function with change points 
1t  and 2t . Moreover, ( )r t  satisfies ( 1C ) - ( 2C ) or ( 1C ) - ( 3C ). 
Then, * ( , 2)K a W∈ , * ( 2 , )L W W∈ , and the optimal strategy is to use the new 
( , )K L  strategy with * *( , ) ( )hJ K L R W< . 
PROOF. Let K  be fixed and the optimal L  as a function of K , i.e., * ( )L K , 
is found. Then, the optimal K  is obtained by minimizing *( , ( ))J K L K . By 
Lemma 4, the equation ( ) 0G t =  has two roots, (0, 2)a W∈  and ( 2, )b W W∈ . 
Now, the proof is separated into the following cases.

In case (1) 0t , the value of [ ]0,K b∈  which minimizes ( , )J K b , is now
