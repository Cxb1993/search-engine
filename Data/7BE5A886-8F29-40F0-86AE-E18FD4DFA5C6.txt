2.2 Three traffic parameters:  stopped, moving and empty 
Figure 2 defines Stopped, Moving, and Empty. Stopped means that a vehicle is present for more than a 
specified period of time. Moving means that a vehicle is present for less than a specified period of time. 
Empty means that no vehicle is detected during a specified time interval. All of these three new 
parameters depend only on the presence of a vehicle, which is the most reliable traffic parameter in a 
traffic jam. Hence, Stopped, Moving and Empty remain stable and pertinent during a traffic jam.

Fig. 4 Departure shockwave detection 
When a traffic light turns green, the vehicles start to move forward and a departure shockwave 10W  is 
formed. If a vehicle sensor with the capability of outputting three new traffic parameters has been 
installed at a distance D from the stop bar, it will change from Stopped state to Moving state after time
T . Therefore, the departure shockwave can be calculated as    
   
         (8) 
2.5 Ideal  arrival shockwaves computation 
State 2 exhibits an ideal traffic flow, which means that the vehicles arrive at a regular cycle time c, and 
are all discharged in the green phase time g. In green time, the flow is mQ (= 1Q ). Therefore,  2Q  can be 
calculated as  
 
mmc
g
rQQQ 2          (9) 
 
The flow ratio r between  and mQ  equals g/c. To replace x with 2 in equation (2), the ideal forward 
arrival shockwave is calculated to be 
 
101021 11 Wc/gWrW         (10) 
 
Similarly, to replace x with 2 in equation (3), the ideal backward arrival shockwave is calculated as

increases, the green phase time also increases. Thus, the green phase time changes dynamically according 
to the traffic flow.

3.1 Three new traffic parameters  
Figure 7 displays three traffic parameters for two vehicle detectors. Due to changes in phase time, 
some cycle times are shorter or longer than others. When traffic flow is low, the two sensors only output 
Empty and Moving time. The Stopped time of sensors is presented when a traffic queue is shown on the 
detection area. Figure 8 shows the relation between the Stopped time and red phase time. Notably, the 
Stopped time of two sensors occasionally approaches the effective red time, indicating that many vehicles 
are discharged for more than two cycles. In other words, if the Stopped times of two sensors are almost 
the same as the red phase time, the traffic queue has reached the location of sensor 2. Furthermore, 
because traffic is queued from sensor 1 to sensor 2 and disappears from sensor 2 to sensor 1, the cycle 
numbers of the sensor1’s Stopped time are always longer than sensor 2.

lower than the shockwave 12W when the arrival traffic flow is discharged for more than two cycles. On the 
contrary, the shockwave 13W  is higher than the shockwave 12W when the arrival traffic flow is discharged 
for a single cycle. Similarly, the ideal backward arrival shockwave 
20W is a basic curve for general 
backward arrival shockwave 30W . The shockwave 30W  is higher than the shockwave 20W when the 
arrival traffic flow is discharged for more than two cycles. On the contrary, the shockwave 30W  is lower 
than the shockwave 
20W when the arrival traffic flow is discharged for a single cycle. Figure 10 illustrates 
that the algorithm can yield good results. The detected arrival shockwaves are almost identical to the direct 
measure shockwave of CORSIM.

3.3 Flow and speed 
If all shockwaves of state 3 have been detected, the arrival flow and speed of state 3 can be calculated by Eq. (14) 
and (15). These calculations provide an upstream flow and speed detection method that makes it possible to 
determine traffic information far from a sensor’s location. Figure 11 shows the predicted results for flow. To see the 
effect of method, the predicted flow is presented as a ratio of green time’s flow ( mQ ). The new predicted flow is 
almost the same as simulation. Figure 12 shows the predicted results for speed, which is a little lower than the 
previous simulation.
