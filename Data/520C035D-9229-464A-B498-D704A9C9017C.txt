Abstract 
     This report uses the orthogonal function 
approach, Taguchi method and genetic 
algorithm to solve the mixed robust/optimal 
control problem of linear continuous-time 
systems with PID controllers as well as both 
time-varying structured and unstructured 
parameter uncertainties by directly 
considering the quadratically-coupled 
uncertainties in the problem formulation. First, 
the regional eigenvalur-clustering robustness 
problem of PID controlled systems is 
converted to the regional 
eigenvalues-clustering robustness problem of 
singular systems controlled by static output 
feedback controller. Based on the OFA, an 
algorithm only involving algebraic 
computation is derived for the 
quadratic-optimal controller of nominal 
closed-loop singular systems. Using some 
essential properties of matrix measures, a new 
sufficient condition is proposed for ensuring 
that the resulting singular systems with 
structured and quadratically-coupled 
structured parameter uncertainties is regular, 
impulse-free and all the finite eigenvalues 
retained within the specified region. Next, the 
hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) 
approach is applied to design the 
robust/optimal PID controller for the linear 
systems with time-varying structured 
parameter uncertainties. A design example is 
given to illustrate the application of 
integrating the presented sufficient condition, 
OFA and HTGA approach. 
Keywords: Regional eigenvalues-clustering 
robustness, PID controller,  performance, 
singular systems, structured parameter 
uncertainties.

二、計畫緣由與目的 
The PID (proportional-integral-derivative) 
controller is the most common form of 
feedback in use today, and is successfully used 
for a wide range of application: process 
control, motor drives, magnetic and optic 
memories, automotive, flight control, 
instrumentation and so on (Tan et al., 1999; 
Isaksson and Hagglund, 2002). But the 
problem for the performance analysis and 
design of linear multivariable PID control 
systems is still a real challenge to control 
system engineers (Saeki, 2006). Therefore, 
recently, some researchers have proposed 
some approaches to study the performance 
analysis and design problems of linear 
multivariable PID control systems (see, for 
example, Tan et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002; 
Lin et al., 2004; Kim and Cho, 2005; Xue et 
al., 2005; He et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2006;

     Equation (4) is called a singular system, 
generalized state-space system, implicit 
system, semi-state system, or descriptor 
system (Dai, 1989). Here the matrix E  may 
be a singular matrix with . nErank 3)( ≤
The quadratic-optimal control problem 
considered in this paper is to find the optimal 
output feedback controllers for the linear 
singular system in Eq. (4) such that the linear
