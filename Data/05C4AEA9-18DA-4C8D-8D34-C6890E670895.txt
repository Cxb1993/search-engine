英文摘要 
 The dynamic facility layout problem (DFLP) was first proposed by Rosenblatt in 1986.  
Stemming from the traditional facility layout problem (FLP) which is concerned with 
constructing a single layout (considering requirements for a single period), DFLP is concerned 
with constructing a set of two or more layouts, one for each period in the planning horizon. 
 When solving a DFLP, one needs to consider inter-departmental material handling costs just 
like solving an FLP.  In addition, he or she needs to consider department relocation costs: these 
are the costs needed to change a department’s location (moving the department to a new location) 
in a new period.  The main challenge of solving a DFLP is how to balance between material 
handling costs and department relocation costs.  For instance, moving a department to a new 
location may lower the overall material handling costs, but the price for the move (relocation) 
may be huge.  Also, some departments change area (increase or decrease) in different periods, 
and others will be replaced (phased out) by new departments.  All these make solving DFLP’s 
very challenging. 
 In this project, we developed an algorithm to solve DFLP in a heuristic manner.  Built upon 
 研究目的 
The purpose of this project is to develop a heuristic algorithm for solving a new category of 
unequal-area DFLP.  Briefly, in this new category, whether a department is relocated or not is 
measured by a predefined tolerance—if any of the four department boundaries moves beyond the 
tolerance, the department is considered relocated; otherwise, it is not.  We have formulated this 
new DFLP as a mixed integer program (MIP).  As not a surprise that such an MIP is very 
difficult to be solved optimally even for a small number of departments, we set up our goal to 
develop a heuristic algorithm for this new DFLP. 
 
研究方法 
The heuristic algorithm is based on the results obtained from our last NSC project, in which we 
developed a heuristic algorithm for solving the unequal-area FLP formulated as an MIP.  This 
algorithm is based on a “graph pair representation” technique in which a pair of graphs is used to 
represent the relative position of all department pairs.  As the below figure shows, if department 
m is to be in the east of department n in the facility, an edge (m, n) is drawn in the “east-west” 
graph to indicate this relative position between m and n.  Using this technique, all department 
relative positions can be captured and changed via a graph pair.  This allows us to develop a 
heuristic algorithm for the FLP.

 We used results from our study of the FLP as the building blocks of the new algorithm for 
solving the new DFLP.  We would construct a dynamic layout one period at a time.  To 
determine each period’s layout, we used our algorithm for solving the (static) FLP; that is, we 
solved a single period layout model with the departments’ relative positions determined by a 
graph pair.  However, this layout model was incorporated with new binary (0/1) variables and 
new constraints to capture department relocation (with respect to the layout already determined 
for the previous period).  Therefore, the objective of this model was to generate a single layout 
with a lowest total cost of material flows and department relocation.

Further, let M be an arbitrary large positive number, and 
let , , and be binary (0/1) variables indicating the 
four possible ‘relative positions’ (RPs) between departments i 
and j in the facility: is 1 if i is east of j, is 1 if j is east of 
i, is 1 if i is north of j, and is 1 if j is north of i; they are 0 
if otherwise. Then, constraints (1), (2) and (3) below (adopted 
from [15]) can separate i and j in the east-west direction and/or 
the north-south direction.

As an example, in the layout shown in Fig. 2 department 6 
is north of department 5, and we must have (and no other 
0/1 variables for these two departments) set to 1. Observe that 
the ≥  sign in (1) can be replaced with an equal sign without 
changing the optimal solution. Therefore, the problem focus 
becomes: How to fix these four 0/1 variables to satisfy (4) for 
all department pairs while lowering material handling costs as 
much as possible?

A. Graph-pair Representation Technique 
We discovered that graphs are excellent tools for displaying 
and handling the RP between two departments. We use one 
graph for RPs in the east-west direction (called the ‘east-west 
graph’ and denoted as GEW) and another graph for RPs in the 
north-south direction (the ‘north-south graph’, GNS). Our graph-
pair representation technique works as follows. 
Figure 2.  A 6-department layout. 
• Each department i in the layout has one and only one 
corresponding node i in both GEW and GNS and vice 
versa. 
• If department i is ‘strictly east’ of department j in the 
layout, that is, i is east of j but they cannot be separated 
clearly in the north-south direction (e.g., 1 and 3 in Fig. 
2), there must be an edge (i, j) in GEW. Similarly, if i is 
‘strictly north’ of j in the layout, there must be an edge 
(i, j) in GNS. 
• If two departments have a ‘compound RP’ that they 
can be separated in both east-west and north-south 
directions, for example, 5 is east of 4 and 4 is north of 
5 in Fig. 2, there can be an edge in GEW (e.g., (5,4) in 
GEW) or an edge in GNS (e.g., (4,5) in GNS) but not in 
both graphs. 
This technique demands GEW and GNS to each have n nodes 
and contain totally n(n–1)/2 edges. Fig. 3 illustrates a graph-
pair representation for RPs obtained from the layout in Fig. 2; 
those dashed edges indicate a compound RP between the 
corresponding two departments in the layout. 
B. Layout Construction with Graph-pair Representation 
The graph-pair representation technique provides an overall 
view of how two departments are located relative to each other 
in the layout. Moreover, as the focus of solving UA-FLPs is the 
determination of the binary variables in (4) (which one should 
be 1), the two graphs provide an ideal media through which 
these variables can be fixed and changed quite easily. For 
layout construction, we will draw an edge in either GEW or GNS 
for each department pair; this corresponds to fixing one binary 
variable in (4) to 1 and all three others to 0. This fixing would 
in turn ‘activate’ (2) or (3) to separate the two departments in 
the proper direction. For example, if an edge is drawn from 
node j to node i in GEW, this would correspond to fixing in 
(4) to 1 and all three other 0/1 variables to 0. Use these values 
in (2) and (3) and they are now reduced to only one active 
separation constraint for i and j: ; all other separation 
constraints are now redundant and can be removed from the 
model. Repeat the same procedure for every department pair 
and the result is an LP which can be solved quite easily.

The graph-pair representation technique can also create 
new graph pairs by moving an edge from its current graph to 
the other. This is called ‘edge migration’ (EM) and it changes 
the RP of the selected two departments from, say, east-west, to 
north-south. EM is crucial to layout improvement as it changes 
the graph pair’s fundamental structure which cannot be done 
with DR. Note that we will exclude enforced t-edges for EM 
because the two departments of such an edge are not adjacent 
and may be far away from each other in the layout. Changing 
their RPs does not seem likely to produce an LP that is feasible. 
Therefore, only non t-edges are allowed for EM. The following 
steps describe how EM is used to generate new layouts. 
1. Randomly select a non t-edge, say, (i, j). Delete (i, j) 
from its current graph. 
2. Randomly determine a new edge for i and j in the 
other graph, i.e., (i, j) or (j, i). 
3. Check cycles for the new edge and reverse the new 
edge if cycles will form. 
4. Enforce as many missing t-edges as possible due to 
the addition of the new edge. A new graph pair is 
obtained. 
5. Solve the LP resulted from the new graph pair. If the 
LP is feasible, a new layout is obtained. 
Fig. 6 illustrates the new graph pair obtained after 
migrating edge (5, 4) from GEW to GNS in Fig. 3. Note that (5, 4) 
was not a t-edge in GEW. The new edge for departments 4 and 5 
is still (5, 4) in GNS. This new edge creates a missing t-edge (5, 
3) in the graph and t-edge enforcement is hence needed (which 
may bring more edges from GEW to GNS). 
D. Department Area Approximation 
Department area requirements have also received much 
attention. Initially, [15] used a range predetermined for each 
department’s length, width and perimeter to provide a linear 
area approximation, but the results were not impressive. 
Various methods have been proposed after that; see, for 
example, [5, 8, 14]. We adopted a four-line approximation 
approach and the area constraints used in our LP model are 
shown below. The lines’ slopes and intercepts (those S’s and 
I’s in the equations) are determined using standard regression 
methods (details in Appendix). This approach is simple, does 
not introduce any new decision variables into the model, and 
delivers acceptable results. For example, when the maximum 
shape ratio is 4.0, the approximation error is less than 3%.

III. LAYOUT ALGORITHM 
We now present a heuristic algorithm which solves UA-
FLPs with the graph-pair representation technique. The new 
algorithm has a construction and an improvement phases. In 
the construction phase, each department pair is assigned an 
edge using the methods described in Section II. Potential cycles 
are checked every time a new edge is added to the graph pair; 
missing t-edges are enforced whenever possible. The layout 
construction phase is performed as follows. 
1. Initialize GEW and GNS. 
2. Randomly select a department pair, say, i and j, with 
their edge still not determined in the graph pair. 
3. Randomly determine if (i, j) or (j, i) will be the edge 
for i and j and randomly select GEW and GNS for the 
new edge. 
4. Check potential cycles in the selected graph for the 
new edge. Then add the new edge accordingly. 
5. Enforce as many missing t-edges in the selected 
graph as possible. 
6. If every department pair has an edge in the graph pair, 
go to step 7; otherwise, go to step 2. 
7. Use the graph pair to determine separation constraints 
for each department pair. Solve the resulting LP. If 
the LP is feasible, stop as an initial layout has been 
obtained. Otherwise, go to step 1. 
The improvement phase immediately begins upon the finish 
of the construction phase. In this phase, new layouts are 
systematically generated using department relabeling (DR) or 
edge migration (EM). And these layouts are accepted or 
rejected along the course of improvement which is driven by 
simulated annealing. In particular, the simulated annealing 
algorithm described in [11] is adapted to drive our layout 
improvement. A high level view of our improvement process is 
as follows. 
1. Select DR or EM with probability 0.70 and 0.30, 
respectively. Randomly select an eligible edge. If DR 
is selected, go to step 2; otherwise, go to step 3. 
2. (DR) Relabel the two nodes of the selected edge in 
both GEW and GNS to create a new graph pair. Go to 
step 5. 
disappearance of a department, that ‘department’ can 
be modeled as a real department with a very small area 
(say, 0.001) and zero flow from/to other departments. 
This way, graph pairs would all have the same number 
of nodes and edges across the planning horizon, thus 
reducing complexity of the heuristic solution process.

APPENDIX 
Our department area approximation is illustrated in the next 
figure (Fig. 7) in which xy=A represents the curve of 
department area. Four lines are used to approximate the curve. 
To determine the ‘best fit’ values for the lines’ slopes and 
intercepts, the two end points on the curve are calculated using 
the department’s maximum allowable shape ratio. These two 
points define the range on the curve from which data points are 
sampled to best fit the lines, which is determined by 
minimizing the sum of squared errors of the standard 
regression method.
