Abstract 
This project is to investigate the nonlinearly constrained detector allocation problems 
in which the types of detectors and the corresponding numbers and locations are to be 
decided simultaneously so as to minimize the maximum detecting failure rate in a 
specified area.  In other words, the objective of the detector allocation problem is to 
minimize the maximum failure rate by deciding the best possible combination of three 
types of decision variables, i.e., the type of detector, the numbers of each transmitter 
type and where to build up each of them within a specified plan. So, the quality of 
reliability of event detecting can be assured and consistent.  By the way, the intensity 
of the signal usually decays proportionally to some power of the distance from the 
detector.  That makes the longer distance far away the detector, the bigger failure rate 
in detection of the event. Through this project, we wish to build up the mathematical 
model and then provide the best strategy to allocate the detectors optimally. The 
detector allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming 
model, usually using mathematical programming or heuristic optimization approaches 
for finding the optimal solution or near optimal solution.  The difficulties 
encountered for both methodologies are the amount of decision variables and the 
difficulty of satisfying constraints.  In this project, a grid computing based hybrid 
meta-evolutionary approach has be developed for overcoming the difficulties and 
finding the optimal solutions for the detector allocation problems efficiently and 
effectively.  Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology has been 
evaluated with the commercial optimization software (ex. Lingo).

【Drezner et al., 2002】，然而實際上卻有所不同。此外、對於廠址選擇問題雖然
有文獻考量到設施的設置對顧客的服務的可靠度(reliability)與距離有關【Berman 
et al., 2003】，而欲將設施服務的可靠度予以最大化，似乎與計畫所提的偵測訊號
強度會隨著距離因素而衰退的特性相近，除此之外，該文獻但仍與過去一般廠址
的選擇問題並無太大之差異。本研究計畫所提與其主要相異處如下列幾點所述： 
1. 廠址選擇的問題如 p-median problem 【Drezner, 1998】、【Hankimi, 1986】，
每一個服務需求點皆服從由距離該點最近的設施(facility)來獲得服務；然
而所提計畫問題對於每一個服務需求點其服務來源不必然須從最近的設
施而來。 
2. 所提問題不同於廠址選擇問題一般並無同時求解不同規格之設施及相對
應數目之問題求解。 
3. 廠址選擇問題的目標成本函數（Objective）一般形式乃是由需求量（人
口分部）與設施距離的乘積和來制訂【Berman and Simchi-Levi, 1990】、
【Chen, 1988】；然而本研究之目標函數乃為欲使每一個服務需求點「事
件」發生時，其同時被所有偵測器偵測不到的最大的失敗機率最小化，
亦即要確保所服務範圍的偵測品質達到一致性。雖然所提問題之目標函
數為一MinMax的目標函數而非一MiniSum的問題。 
由上述可知所提問題的求解更為複雜且困難。

相對應設置的「位置」，而欲使該特定區域任何一地點之訊號偵測最大失效率達
到最小化。亦即希望在有限的成本考量下，如何同時決定「類別」、「數目」、「位
址」三類決策變數，而欲使特定區域範圍內所有地點訊號偵測之最大失效率最
小化，此目的是欲使所有地點的偵測品質（整體偵測可靠度）達到最佳的一致
性。隨著「偵測器」設立的位址與「事件」發生地點之距離逐漸增加時，偵測
器之訊號強度便會逐漸呈現衰退，因此偵測失效率也會隨之升高。透過本計畫
研究內容，期能提供此類偵測配置問題有一最佳化的策略依據。

each of them within a specified zone. Thus, the quality of signal detection can be 
assured more consistently.  Moreover, the intensity of the signal usually decays 
proportionally to some power of the distance from the detector.  That makes the 
longer distance be farther from the detector, the bigger failure rate by the detectors is 
to be caused.  The signal detector allocation problem is formulated as a mixed 
integer nonlinear programming model.  The difficulties encountered are the amount 
of decision variables and the difficulty of satisfying constraints.  
The realistic application for the proposed model includes the cellular phone 
transmitter location application. When one is placing a phone call, a transmitter has to 
detect the phone call to facilitate the connection. So, the locations of all the 
transmitters become very important to provide customer with high quality of phone 
call service. In the literature, very few researchers investigated the relative research. 
Drezner and Wesolowsky (1997) were the pioneers to study the problems. However, 
in their model, only the locations are to be solved while the number and types of all 
detectors are given. While one detector location problem in their model, it can be seen 
as a 1-center or minimax single facility location problem (Love et al, 1988). Moreover, 
the multiple detector problems resemble the p-center problems (Plastria, 1995). The 
problems belong to the non-convex problem that may have many local optima. But 
the detector location problem discussed in our study is more complicated than those 
studied in the literature. We considers the nonlinearly constrained multiple category 
signal detector allocation problems in which the types of signal detectors and the 
corresponding numbers and locations are to be decided simultaneously so as to 
minimize the maximum detection failure rate that may occurs in a specified area. 
Recently, artificial immune algorithms (IAs), which were originally proposed by 
Jerne (1974), have been widely studied and applied to a variety of engineering 
optimization problems, usually of a combinatorial nature. Owing to numerous reports 
of successful applications of these innovative algorithms, IAs have attracted more 
recent attention than most other heuristic/metaheuristic methods in various field of 
optimization, including the reliability problems. For instance, Chen and You (2005) 
used IAs to solve redundancy allocation problems (integer reliability problems) and 
reported effective solutions.

detectors with the corresponding categories and the approximated location are able to 
be obtained by using AIs in the first stage. In the next stage the approximated location 
of each detector is adjusted by using particle swarm optimization. It is to improve the 
solutions obtained in the first stage, i.e., the approximated locations of all the 
detectors are fine tuned to minimize the maximum failure rate based on the 
deployment of the various detectors. 
Introduction to Artificial Immune Algorithms 
The nature immune system is a very intricate system for defense against pathogenic 
organisms. A two-tier line of defense is in the system including the innate and the 
adaptive immune systems.  The basic components are lymphocytes and antibodies 
(Farmer et al., 1986). The cells of the innate immune system are immediately 
available to combat against a wide variety of antigen without previous exposure to 
them. The antibody production in response to a determined infectious agent (antigen) 
is the adaptive immune response mediated by lymphocytes which are responsible for 
recognition and elimination of the pathogenic agents (De Castro and Timmis, 2002). 
The cells in the adaptive system are able to develop an immune memory so that they 
can recognize the same antigenic stimulus when it is presented to the organism again. 
Also, all the antibodies are produced only in response to specific infections. The 
lymphocytes carry surface receptor molecules capable of recognizing antigens. The 
antigens will only bind to these receptors with which it makes a good fit. 
To distinguish and eliminate the intruders of the organism is the main task of the 
immune system so that it must have the capability of self/non-self discrimination.  
Epitope is portion of antigen recognized by antibody and acts as an antigen 
determinant. Each antibody has its own specific antigen determinant which is called 
idiotope. In order to produce enough specific effector cells to against an infection, the 
activated lymphocyte has to proliferate and then differentiate into these effector cells. 
This process is called clonal selection and then a large clone of plasma cell is formed. 
Thus, the antibodies can be secreted and ready to bind antigens. According to above 
facts, Jerne (1973) proposed an idiotype network hypothesis which is based on the 
clonal selection theory.  In his hypothesis, some types of recognizing sets are 
activated by some antigens and produce an antibody which will then activate other 
types of recognizing sets. Finally, the activation is propagated through entire network 
of recognizing sets via antigen-antibody reactions. It is noted that the antigen 
identification is not done by a single or multiple recognizing sets but by 
antigen-antibody interactions (Huwang, 2000).  According to this point of view, the 
antibody and antigen can be looked as the solution and objective function 
respectively.  
Introduction to Particle Swarm Optimization 
In PSO, individuals (or particles) work by cooperation and competition between 
themselves. Each individual adjusts its flying by its own experience with the 
information from companions. Each individual represents a potential solution to the 
problem. The particles fly through the search space by updating the position of the ith 
particle at time t according the following equation (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995):  
6 
individuals. 
Step 1.6 Check the stopping criterion, if not stop then go to Step 1.3. Otherwise go to 
next step. 
Step 1.7 Stop. The best n solutions obtained in memory are then sent to Phase II. 
Phase II –Solutions adjustment process 
 In this phase, the best n solutions obtained from previous phase are to be 
adjusted by PSO for improving the solutions individually. It is noted that only the 
positions of the detectors are adjusted but the categories and the number of detectors 
are fixed.   
Step 2.1 Generate an initial population of particles by varying the positions of a 
solution randomly. 
Step 2.2 Evaluate each of the particles (solutions) based on the Equation (3). 
Step 2.3 Update the values of pi (best location this particle has experienced) and pg 
(the best position of the colony) respectively. 
Step 2.4 Using Equation (6) to modify the velocity of each particle based on the 
values of pi and pg obtained in previous step. 
Step 2.5 Modify each particle’s position based on its updated velocity by using 
Equation (5) so that the position of each particle can be then updated. 
Step 2.6 Check the stopping criterion, if not stop then go to Step 2.2. Otherwise go to 
next step. 
Step 2.7 Terminate the solution adjustment process. The best adjusted solution is then 
obtained.

numbers (Michalewicz, 1994) and then rounded up to be integers.  While the number 
of signal detectors is decided, the second binary substring is then divided into g 
substrings in decoding stage 2. For each of g substrings, it contains two sections 
including the detector category and the approximated location respectively. Thus, the 
general form of the solutions can be represented by the proposed binary string. 
While the best n solutions found by IAs in the Phase I, these n solutions are then send 
to PSO in Phase II for adjusting the positions of all detectors in terms of improving 
the approximated solutions obtained from Phase I. So, the solution representation of 
PSO is focus on the adjustment of the detector locations without changing the number 
and categories of signal detectors.  The solution representation of PSO is represented 
by strings of real numbers as shown in Figure 3. Each string contains g substrings 
(locations) and each substring represents the coordinate (x, y) of the corresponding 
signal detector. The value of g depends on the solution given from IAs in Phase I.

Constrained optimization 
For breeding the superior particles for the next generation (iteration), to evaluate the 
antibody is necessary step for the PSO. The goal of PSO is to adapt the unfeasible 
particles to the feasible particles, so as to reduce the constraint violations of the search 
for obtaining the optimal or near optimal solutions. For handling these constraint 
violations, a penalty function has to be defined. The penalty function increases the 
penalty for infeasible solutions based on the distance away from the feasible region.

improvement of the solutions found by the proposed approach to the previous best 
know solutions (Coit and Smith, 1996). MPI is the fraction that the best feasible 
solution achieved of the maximum possible improvement in the system reliability 
failure rates, it is described as: 
MPI (%)=(Fs_LINGO - Fs_IAPSO)/(Fs_LINGO) 
Where Fs_IAPSO represents the maximum failure rate obtained by the proposed hybrid 
meta-evolutionary computation approach and Fs_LINGO represents the maximum failure 
rate obtained by LINGO®. 
The numerical results in Tables 2 which reports the detailed solutions obtained by the 
proposed approach for seventeen test problems and they are compared with those 
obtained by using LINGO®.   
The results in Table 2 indicate that： 
y compared with the solutions of all test problem obtained by LINGO®, twelve out 
of seventeen test problems obtained by the proposed approach are superior to or as 
well as those found by using LINGO®.  Solutions of four test problems found by 
both approaches are the same.  
y five solutions obtained by using the proposed approach are slightly inferior to the 
solution found by LINGO® but those are just worse no more than 2% of MPI.   
y seven solutions found of the proposed approach are superior to those of LINGO®, 
the solution improvement can be up to 64%.  
According to the above observations, it can be conclude that the proposed approach is 
an effective and stable method for the signal detector deployment problem which are 
investigated in this study.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents an meta-evolutionary approach IAPSO for solving nonlinearly 
constrained multiple category signal detector allocation problems in which the types 
of signal detectors and the corresponding numbers and locations are to be decided 
simultaneously so as to minimize the maximum detection failure rate that may occurs 
in a specified area. In the optimization problems, it is to minimize the maximum 
failure rate by deciding the best possible combination of three types of decision 
variables, i.e., the number and category of the signal detectors to be located, and 
where to build up each of them within a specified zone. So, the quality of detection 
can be assured more consistently. As demonstrated in the previous section, the best 
solutions found by the proposed IAPSO are all better than or tie the best solutions by 
Lingo for the multiple category signal detector allocation problems. Based on our 
LINGO IAPOS
