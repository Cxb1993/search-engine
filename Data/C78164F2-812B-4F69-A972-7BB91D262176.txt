III. BINARY GENETIC ALGORITHMS 
    The genetic algorithm, which main proposed a searching 
method of optimal global solutions. In recently years, genetic 
algorithm used to process complex nonlinearly and discon-
tinuous problem. This thesis utilize genetic algorithm to de-
termine parameters of the viscoelastic creep model and simu-
lation creep dynamics. The Flow chart of the genetic algorithm 
is illustrated in Fig. 3. 
1. Set the w  individuals of chromosome in every variable as 
follows 
0 , , , 1 3i ik k c i = "                      (7) 
2. Defined a suitable fitness function as (8), which is index of 
simulation error. In terminal condition,  assume that t  
tend to 0, and simply defined as follows

follows 
( ) ( )1f g f g< −                       (9) 
where ( )f g  is the fitness function of current generation. 
4. The rules for terminating the parameter search is deter-
mined by justifying ( ) ( )max min

missible upper bound. 
IV. FEEDFORWARD TRACKING CONTROLLER 
In this paper, we propose a tracking control method in-
cluding the identification scheme and feedforward controller. 
The block diagram is illustrated in Fig. 4, and The procedure is 
as follows 
1. Assign a reference signal and the control signal (0)du  to 
begin from 0. 
2. Take a sample displacement ( )df k  using identification 
scheme. 
3. Compare ( )df k  with the displacement using creep 
model to calculate the creep output rf . The error is used 
to update the control signal, its formulation is as the ex-
pression. 
( ) ( 1) ( )d d du k u k u k= − + Δ  (10) 
where ( )du kΔ  is the modified control voltage, ( )du k  and 
( 1)du k −  are, respectively, the control voltage with and 
without modifying it. 
3. Input the next reference displacement signal and repeat the 
step 3, and let ( 1) ( )d du k u k− = . 
V. CROSS-COUPLING CONTROLLER 
    In convention tracking control, due to dynamic property of 
each axis were differently and time varied, thus, design for 
tracking controller is significant. Cross-coupling control theo-
rem utilizes geometry of rectangular coordinate to integrate 
tracking error of each axis. Therefore, derived control gain and 
compensation for contour error. By this control method, which 
were cooperatively influenced the position precision of each 
axis to adjust motion direction of platform, to achieve mini-
mize contour error. As shown in Fig. 5, 
x dxe P x= − and y dye P y= − are the tracking errors with respect 
to the individual axis, dnp is the desired position, anp is the 
corresponding actual position and np is the position on the 
reference trajectory that is closest to anp . The overall tracking 
proaches demonstrate the performance and applicability under 
a variety of operating conditions.
