capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach 
for characterizing the gear malfunctions at the DLFs 
corresponding to the meshing frequency as well as the 
shaft rotating frequency.  The Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) is then employed to classify the vibration 
patterns of gear transmission system at different 
malfunctions.  Using the energy distribution at the 
characteristic DLFs as the features, the different 
fault types of gear can be identified by SVM with 
high accuracy.

components of rotating machinery.  On the other hand, there has been an increasing interest in 
applying the cyclostationarity analysis to diagnose the gear faults and another rotating machinery 
because of the properties of periodicity [20-22]. 
Due to the complexity of measured data, different classification and discrimination 
algorithms have been applied to identify the fault types of gearbox systems and demonstrated the 
effectiveness of diagnosis.  Neural network and pattern recognition are the broadly used 
techniques for classifying the faults of gear systems and have attracted many researchers and 
engineers devoting in this field [10, 23-25].  Alternatively, the support vector machine (SVM) 
can be also employed to classify different fault types of gear transmission systems [7, 15].  In 
addition, Saravanan et al.[9] presented the fault diagnosis results of spur bevel gearbox by using 
the J48 decision tree algorithm combining the discrete wavelet analysis for feature selection and 
classification.  Moreover, a weighted K nearest neighbor classification algorithm was utilized by 
Lei and Zuo [26] to identify the gear damage levels. 
As investigated in the previous studies of rotating machine condition monitoring, the major 
features of machine fault are strongly governed by the shaft rotating speed.  Namely, the 
characteristic frequencies of rotating machinery are the functions of shaft rotating speed.  In 
most previous literature, the conclusions and results of diagnostics in rotary systems are based on 
the operating condition of steady shaft rotating speed.  Unsteady rotating speed will 
consequently generate time-dependent characteristics of the rotary system.  However, the shaft 
rotating speed is normally varying along with the environmental situations as well as the machine 
loads, such as the small-size wind turbine rotating with variable speed driven by variable wind 
levels and directions.  It is difficult to achieve the precise fault diagnosis and online inspection 
by using the traditional approaches if the system is operating under variable rotating speed.  
McBain and Timusk [27] proposed a method to account for the effects of variable rotating speed.  
In their approach, the vibration response is segmented into speed bins with a small range of speed, 
and then the statistical parameters of each bin are derived for separating the data of healthy and 
faulted gear states.  Nevertheless, the derived parameters and separating results may be affected 
by the choice of segmentation as well as the interpolation method, particularly in the operating 
condition of severe fluctuated speed.  Meltzer and Ivanov [28] dealt with the recognition of 
faults in toothing during non-stationary startup and rundown of gear drive.  In their investigation, 
new kernels were created for cases of the known-in-advance angular acceleration of gear drive. 
The order tracking technique is to acquire the measurements with identical angle increment 
instead of the identical sampling period.  In general, this technique, therefore, is eligible to 
remove the factor of shaft rotating speed, and can be utilized to analyze the rotary system in case 
of variable shaft rotating speed [29-31].  The inevitable drawback of employing the traditional 
order tracking techniques is that a specific hardware is required to capture the measurements with 
precisely identical angle increment.  These hardware facilities are generally incompatible with 
the common-used signal acquisition devices that operate with a fixed sampling frequency.  Fyfe 
and Munck [32] proposed a computed order tracking method in which the vibration signal is 
reconstructed by interpolating the data points that are computed in terms of the signals of 
keyphasor and regular vibration sensor.  Additionally, a hybrid method combining the traditional 
and computed order tracking techniques was proposed by Bossley et al. [33].  Although the two 
approaches demonstrated the improvement over the traditional order tracking method, their 
methods need sophisticated interpolation algorithms to reconstruct the vibration data.  Even 
though the hybrid method has the merit of high precision, it still requires the specific hardware to 
facilitate the measurement, as the same as the traditional order tracking technique. 
On the other hand, most of the conventional fault diagnosis methods are Fourier analysis 
based techniques.  The Fourier analysis, however, is applicable to linear systems and stationary 
data.  The mechanical vibration due to malfunctions of gears may exceed the elastic range and 
exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary behavior.  For such a complicated vibration, more harmonic 
components are needed to synthesize the distorted nonlinear waveforms if the Fourier-based 
methods are utilized.  These harmonic components exist only for mathematical satisfaction 
without obvious physical representations.  Furthermore, it is generally difficult to directly 
extract the fault features from the original measurements because of the complexity of signals as 
 4 
single IMF, which is mostly caused by signal intermittency.  The mode mixing may be 
interpreted incorrectly that different physical meaning is represented by this mode [36].  On the 
other hand, this phenomenon implies that there is energy leakage from one IMF component to its 
adjacent mode.  Because the orthogonality is the inherent property of IMFs [35], the mode 
mixing contradicts the fundamental characteristic of independency among the decomposed 
components.  The other problem, the end effect, is the phenomenon that there exists a drift in the 
ends of the finite length of signals.  In order to resolve the aforementioned drawbacks, the 
EEMD method was proposed to improve the problems [36].  In the EEMD method, the random 
white noise is injected into the original measured signal x(t) to form the j-th artificial measurement 
xj(t), 
( ) ( ) ( )j jx t x t w t= + .                              (2) 
The EMD operation is then employed to decompose the j-th artificial measurement into different 
components gjk(t), that is:

Once this step is repeated many times, the final result of IMF components is obtained by 
computing the ensemble mean of the corresponding components, that is:

where m is the number of IMFs and Ne is the ensemble number of the EEMD process.  In order 
to let the injected white noise series cancel each other in the final mean of the corresponding 
IMFs, a well-established statistical rule [36] was formulated to provide the minimal ensemble 
number of EEMD algorithm, Ne, such that the low signal-to-noise ratio will not significantly 
affect the final result of IMFs,

where ε represents the amplitude of the added white noise and εn represents the final standard 
deviation of error, which is defined as the difference between the original measurement and sum of 
the corresponding IMFs and the trend.  Since the injected random white noise series in the 
EEMD method can provide a uniform reference scale distribution to facilitate EMD, and help to 
establish a reference frame in the time-frequency space, therefore the EEMD method can be 
utilized to resolve the mentioned mode mixing and end effect problems [36]. 
As examined on the final EEMD results, the ensemble mean results of EEMD process are 
not necessarily the IMFs.  For such components, the corresponding Hilbert spectra may have 
alias, and hence the Hilbert spectrum analysis of these components may not be feasible.  
Therefore, the post-processing of EEMD [19, 36] is an unavoidable step to resolve such a 
non-IMF problem.  The procedure of the post-processing of EEMD can be stated as the 
following steps: 
(i) The first component decomposed from EEMD process, h1(t), is re-decompose through 
EMD method: 
EMD
1 1 1( ) ( ) ( )h t c t q t→ + ,                            (6) 
where c1(t) represents the first component obtained by applying the EMD method and q1(t) 
is the remainder.  Since the first decomposed component of this step, c1(t), dominates 
h1(t) and satisfies the aforementioned two conditions of IMF, therefore, it is extracted as 
the first IMF. 
(ii) Through the same procedure, the remainder, qk-1(t), is then added into hk(t) to form the 
new sequential signal, Dk(t).  By applying the EMD method to Dk(t), we can also extract 
the first component as the k-th IMF, ck(t), and the remainder, qk(t): 
EMD

The AM part of the data is generally different from the modulus of the analytical signal.  As 
indicated and demonstrated by Huang et al. [37], the AM part of data is smoother than the 
modulus of analytical signal of data and devoid of the higher frequency fluctuation and 
overshoots as in the modulus of analytical signal. 
(2) Generalized zero-crossing (GZC): 
The zero-crossing method is the most fundamental method for computing the local 
frequency.  In the GZC method, the temporal resolution is improved to a quarter wave period by 
taking all zero-crossings and local extrema as the critical points. 
In the GZC method, three classes of time intervals are considered as a whole, half or 
quarter period, respectively.  Firstly, the time interval between two consecutive up (or down) 
zeros-crossings or two consecutive maxima (or minima) is counted to be a whole period.  Each 
point along the time axis has four values which are determined from this class of period.  
Secondly, the time interval from an up (or down) zero-crossing to the next down (or up) 
zero-crossing or from a local maximum (or minimum) to the next local minimum (or maximum) 
is counted to be a half period.  Each point along the time axis has two values which are 
determined from this class of period.  Finally, the time interval between a local extremum 
(maximum or minimum) and a zero-crossing is counted to be a quarter period.  Each point along 
the time axis has only one value which is determined from this class of period. 
Let the classes of whole, half and quarter periods be designated as T4j, T2j and T1, 
respectively.  Since the class of quarter period, T1, is the most local, the weighting factor of T1 is 
set 4.  Next, the class of half period, T2j, is less local, so the weighting factor of T2j is set 2.  
Obviously, the class of full period, T4j, is least local, so the weighting factor of T4j is set 1.  
Therefore, according to the localness, there are seven (one for full period, two for half period and 
four for quarter period) values of periods at each point along the time axis.  The mean frequency 
at each point along the time axis can thus be calculated as [37]

The GZC method is based on the fundamental definition of frequency and hence it gives 
the most accurate and physically meaningful mean local frequency.  Since the GZC method 
involves no transforms or differentiations, it is direct and robust.  The limitations of GZC 
method include its crude localization, only down to a quarter wavelength at most, and its inability 
to represent the details of waveform distortion [37]. 
(3) Direct Quadrature (DQ): 
After the normalization process as stated in NHT, the empirical FM part of IMF, F(t), is 
the carrier part of the data.  Assume the carrier part is a cosine function, and its quadrature can 
be simply expressed as 
2sin ( ) 1 ( )t F tφ = − .                            (16) 
Since the DQ preserves the phase function of the real data without the distortion caused by 
analytical signal, it can be utilized to compute the correct phase function as well as the further 
instantaneous frequency.  It is also noted that the DQ bypasses the Hilbert transform and does 
not involve integral interval.  Thus, its value is not influenced by any neighboring points and the 
frequency computation is based on differentiation.  Therefore, it is as local as any methods can 
be.  Furthermore, without integral transform, it can preserve the phase function of any data 
exactly for an arbitrary phase function [37]. 
In order to obtain more stable computation of phase angle, Huang et al. [37] proposed a 
modified approach through computing the phase angle by arctangent, that is,

Here F(t) has to be a perfectly normalized IMF after repeated normalization process as stated 
previously.  Namely, the value of F(t) has to be less or equal to unity, otherwise Equation (16) 
will become imaginary.  The instantaneous frequency can thus be determined through the

As emphasized in this paper, the gear transmission system may be operating with variable 
rotating speed in many cases.  In such a condition, the vibration signals during the gear meshing 
process reveal non-stationary behavior, and the aforementioned characteristic frequencies, except 
for the natural frequency, are varying along with the rotating speed.  Therefore, it is difficult to 
analyze the non-stationary vibration signals through the traditional Fourier spectrum analysis 
method. 
In this paper, the Dimensionless Frequency (DLF) normalization method is proposed to 
deal with such kind of vibration signals in case of variable rotating speed.  In order to remove 
the factor of rotating speed, the rotation frequency of shaft, ωs(t), is measured synchronously with 
the measurement of vibration.  The non-stationary vibration signal is then decomposed into a 
number of IMFs through EMD or EEMD method.  By using the introduced methods of 
instantaneous frequency calculation, the instantaneous frequency of the k-th IMF, ωk(t) can be 
determined.  The instantaneous DLF of the k-th IMF is then obtained through DLF 
normalization, that is, 
0 ( )( )

Substituting the instantaneous frequency ωk(t) in Equation (18) and (19) by 0 ( )k tω , the 
time-DLF-amplitude (energy) distribution of IMFs and the marginal DLF spectrum can be clearly 
formulated.  Obviously, with the DLF normalization, the factor of variable shaft rotating speed 
can be removed, and the related characteristic frequencies can be observed more easily at 
constant values. 
Experimental Validation 
In order to verify the proposed approach on characterizing the malfunctions in the gear 
transmission system, a simplified test rig that consists of a pair of spur gears, shafts and bearing 
sets, is performed to illustrate the experimental cases of gear faults.  The feasibility and 
effectiveness of the proposed approach are then evaluated.  The experimental configuration is 
shown in Figure 1(a) and schematically plotted in Figure 1(b).  The driving shaft is connected to 
a flexible coupling that is driven by a motor.  The driving gear (#1, 23T) mounted on the driving 
shaft is meshing with the driven gear (#2, 51T) which is mounted on the driven shaft.  The two 
shafts are supported by four sets of bearings.  The accelerometer (PCB Model 355B04) is 
installed to measure the vibration, and then the signals are captured by the data acquisition device, 
NI9234.  The rotating speed of the driving shaft is synchronously measured through the encoder.  
The profile of motor rotating speed is first set by LabVIEW software and then feed the command 
through the motor control unit and NI9401 DIO card.  The oil tank is utilized to provide an 
adequate lubrication during the gear meshing process. 
As shown in Table 1, five cases of gear faults are illustrated in this experiment.  Case 1 
and Case 4 represent the gear transmission system operating under the normal condition and the 
vibration signals are measured at bearing #1 and Bearing #2, respectively.  In Case 2, a tooth of 
gear #1 is artificially scratched by a chisel to simulate the occurrence of gear tooth wearing.  
One of the teeth on gear #1 is removed to simulate the gear with a broken tooth in Case 3.   In 
Case 5, a tiny mass is stuck on gear #2 to artificially produce the gear unbalance condition.  The 
NI9234 DAQ card is used to synchronously acquire the vibration signals from the accelerometer 
as well as the rotating speed of shaft with the sampling frequency of 4.6 KHz.  In order to verify 
the consistence of characterizing the gear faults, twenty sets of signals for each experiment case, 
total one hundred sets of signals, are recorded with data length of 6.5 seconds. 
Under the same pre-set of motor speed, the total one hundred signal sets of vibrating 
acceleration and driving shaft rotating speed, twenty sets for each case, are measured and 
recorded.  The corresponding rotating speed of driven shaft during the gear meshing process is 
also computed.  The Fourier spectra of the measured vibration signals in different cases (normal, 
worn tooth, broken tooth and unbalance), are first shown in Figure 2.  As shown in this figure, 
due to the variable shaft rotating speed which results the non-stationary vibration signals, the 
characteristic frequencies, such as the shaft rotation frequency (9.9-27.4 Hz) and gear meshing 
 10 
method.  The part (a) of these two figures presents the collection of marginal DLF spectra of 
total forty data sets (twenty sets for each case), and the part (b) shows the mean marginal DLF 
spectra of the corresponding cases.  Similarly as Case 2 and Case 3, there is vibration energy 
concentrated around the DLF range of 1 and 51.  As presented in Figure 15, the malfunction of 
gear unbalance causes the energy increasing at the DLF of 1.  Oppositely, the Figure 16 does not 
demonstrate such apparent and consistent conclusion at the DLF of 51.  By observing these two 
figures, one can infer that the major feature of gear unbalance can be identified in the energy 
level change at the DLF of 1 which is corresponding to the shaft rotating speed. 
In order to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the support 
vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed to classify the different malfunctions of gear 
transmission system in case of variable shaft rotating speed.  As pointed out in the analysis of 
marginal DLF spectra previously, the major features of gear include the energy distribution at the 
DLFs of 1, 23 and 51, which represent the shaft rotation frequency and gear meshing frequencies 
of driving and driven shafts, respectively.  Therefore, the magnitude of marginal DLF spectra at 
the corresponding characteristic DLFs (1, 23 and 51) are selected as the features for classification 
of SVM.  The Radial Basis Function (RBF) is utilized as the kernel function of SVM in this 
study.  Eighteen data sets of each case, total ninety data sets, of all cases, are randomly extracted 
for SVM training and the remaining ten data sets are utilized for testing.  The procedure is 
repeating ten times.  The classification results are shown in Table 2.  The left column of this 
table represents the true experimental cases.  The top row represents the corresponding fault 
cases the selected features are classified to.  The middle array of the table indicates the numbers 
of data sets in experimental cases which are classified to the corresponding fault cases.  As 
observed in Table 2, all the testing data sets are classified to the correct corresponding fault cases 
except for the four data sets of Case 2 (worn tooth) and four data sets of Case 3 (broken tooth).  
It can be inferred that the vibration patterns of broken tooth and worn tooth have similar features.  
As indicated in the analysis of Figure 13, the major feature of broken tooth as well as worn tooth 
can be observed in the energy concentration at the DLF of 23 which represents the gear meshing 
frequency.  Since the broken tooth condition is serious than the worn tooth condition, the 
difference between these two fault conditions is mainly observed in energy level at the DLF of 23.  
Conclusively, the vibration patterns of different gear fault types can be accurately classified by 
SVM (more than 90 percentile) through DLF normalization process. 
Conclusions 
In this paper, a novel approach, instantaneous DLF normalization combining HHT, is 
proposed to characterize the malfunctions of gear transmission system in case of variable rotating 
speed.  The vibration signals of running gears with faults, including worn tooth, broken tooth 
and unbalance, are decomposed by EEMD method and the instantaneous frequencies of the 
associated IMFs are determined by using NHT, GZC and DQ methods, respectively.  The 
instantaneous DLF normalization is employed to remove the factor of shaft rotating speed, so that 
the analysis of DLF distribution can be utilized to characterize the occurrence of faulty gears 
under variable rotating speed.  With different methods of instantaneous frequency computation, 
the time-DLF-energy distributions consistently reveal that more vibration energy concentrates at 
the DLFs of the corresponding gear meshing frequency as well as shaft rotation frequency.  The 
analysis results of marginal DLF spectra present that the major feature of gear defects, such as 
worn tooth and broken tooth, is observed in vibration energy increase at the DLF of the 
corresponding gear meshing frequency.  On the other hand, the analysis results also demonstrate 
that the malfunction of gear unbalance reflects the vibration energy change at the DLF of the 
corresponding shaft rotation frequency.  The SVM classifier is also utilized to identify the 
different faults of gear transmission system, and accurate classification results are obtained.  
Conclusively, the analysis results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed 
approach for characterizing the occurrence of gear faults in case of variable rotating speed.

三、發表論文全文或摘要 
The research purpose is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) 
approach and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify the features of the vibration signal of 
roller bearing system. The vibration signals are measured in case of different fault types, such as outer 
race defect, inner race defect, and roller defect. Through the HHT method, the vibration signals are 
decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) by Empirical Mode Decomposition 
(EMD). The envelope analysis is then employed to the IMFs of high frequencies.  The features of 
different fault types can be identified by examining the energy distribution in the time-frequency Hilbert 
spectrum as well as the marginal Hilbert spectrum. With the selected features from the analysis results of 
HHT, the SVM is utilized to classify the vibration patterns of different defect conditions.  A test rig of 
roller bearing system is performed to illustrate the different defects on the bearings.  The vibration 
acceleration signals in the cases of different bearing defects are measured and analyzed.  The results 
show that the SVM can accurately classify the different defect types of bearing through the selected 
features of HHT analysis.

The research purpose is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing Hilbert-Huang Transform 
(HHT) approach and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify the fault features 
of the vibration signal of roller bearing system.  The vibration signals are measured under the 
occurrence of different fault types and levels, such as severe and slight outer race defect, se-
vere and slight inner race defect, and roller defect.  Through the HHT method, the vibration 
signals are decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) by Empirical Mode 
Decomposition (EMD). The envelope analysis is then employed to the IMFs of high frequen-
cies.  The features of different fault types and levels can be identified by examining the ener-
gy distribution in the time-frequency Hilbert spectrum as well as the marginal Hilbert spec-
trum.  With the selected features from the analysis results of HHT, the SVM is utilized to 
classify the vibration patterns of different defect conditions.  A test rig of roller bearing sys-
tem is performed to illustrate the different faulted conditions on the bearings.  The vibration 
acceleration signals in the cases of different bearing defects types and levels are measured 
and analyzed.  The results show that the SVM can accurately classify the different bearing 
faulted conditions through the selected features of HHT analysis. 
1. Introduction 
The fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is an important task and has attracted much atten-
tion in the academic fields as well as the industrial applications.  Among large numbers of compo-
nents and devices in mechanical systems, bearing is one of the crucial parts and frequently utilized 
in rotating machinery.  Because of several reasons such as material fatigue, the occurrence of bear-
ing detriment is inevitable after a period of operation.  Therefore, the identification of bearing fault 
in the early stage is import for maintenance engineering and safety management in the fields of me-
chanical and aerospace industries. 
The bearing fault detection has been investigated for decades and promising results can be 
found in previous literature.  Randall1, 2 presented a complete and systematic review to summarize 
the measurement techniques and the fault diagnosis of rotary systems.  The envelope analysis and 
demodulation technique are also used to analyze the vibration signals and extract the features of 
different bearing defects3-6.  In order to identify the different fault types in rotating machinery, clas-

where x(t) represents any complicated non-linear and non-stationary signal, ck(t) is the k-th IMF of 
the signal x(t) and rm(t) represents the final residue which can be a constant or the signal mean trend.  
Based on the concept of EMD, each IMF component satisfies the following conditions12: (1) The 
number of extrema and the number of zero-crossings must be either equal or differ at most by one 
in the whole data set; (2) At any point, the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima 
and the envelope defined by the local minima is zeros.  It is noted apparently that each IMF only 
has one frequency value at any moment.  It is, therefore, feasible to compute a meaningful instanta-
neous frequency once the multi-component signal is reduced to a collection of mono-oscillation 
component through the EMD process. 
2.2 Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) 
Although the EMD process is capable of decomposing complicated non-linear and non-
stationary signals into numbers of IMFs adaptively, however, there exist two unsatisfactory prob-
lems which are encountered frequently in practical applications.  One is mode mixing and the other 
is end effect.  The mode mixing is the phenomenon that disparate frequencies exist in a single IMF, 
which is mostly caused by signal intermittency.  The mode mixing may be interpreted incorrectly 
that different physical meaning is represented by this mode14.  Moreover, the mode mixing phe-
nomenon of IMFs implies energy leakage from one IMF component to its adjacent mode, and thus 
the independency among the IMF components is not imposed.  The end effect is the phenomenon 
that there exists a drift in the ends of the finite length of signals. 
Due to the mentioned problems of EMD, Wu and Huang14 proposed the Ensemble EMD 
(EEMD) method to resolve the problems.  The basic idea of EEMD method is to introduce the 
white noise series into the original signal, so that the introduced white noises can provide a uniform 
reference scale distribution, and facilitate EMD for addressing the aforementioned drawbacks.  In 
the EEMD method, the random white noise is injected into the original measured signal x(t) to form 
the j-th artificial measurement xj(t), 
( ) ( ) ( )j jx t x t w t= +                                                            (2) 
The EMD operation is then performed to decompose xj(t) into different components gjk(t), that is:

This step is then repeated many times, and thus the final result of IMF components is obtained by 
computing the ensemble mean of the corresponding components, that is:

where m is the number of IMFs and Ne is the ensemble number of the EEMD process.  In order to 
let the added white noise series cancel each other in the final mean of the corresponding IMFs and 
hence increase the signal-to-noise ratio, Wu and Huang14 provided a statistical rule to formulated 
the relationship among the ensemble number, the added noise level and the error tolerance,

where ε represents the amplitude of the added white noise and εn represents the final standard devia-
tion of error, which is defined as the difference between the original measurement and sum of the 
corresponding IMFs and the trend.

Hilbert spectrum and its corresponding marginal Hilbert spectrum of the envelope that is de fined 
by the cubic spline fitting of extrema of the first IMF under normal condition with the rotating 
speed of 720 RMP.  As observed in this figure, the vibration energy concentration can be only ob-
served at 12 Hz which is corresponding to the shaft rotation frequency.  One of the normal bearing 
set is then replaced by the faulted bearing of outer race defects (Case 2 and 3) to simulate the bear-
ing operation condition under the slight and severe outer race faults.  Figs. 2 and 3 show the time-
frequency Hilbert spectra and their corresponding marginal Hilbert spectra of the envelope of the 
first IMF in cases of slight outer race defect (Case 2) and severe outer race defect (Case 3) with the 
rotating speed of 720 RMP.  As shown in these two figures, more vibration energy can be found at 
46 Hz as well as 12Hz and 25 Hz which are corresponding to bearing characteristic frequencies of 
outer race fault, shaft rotation and roller self-rotation, respectively.  It can be also noted that the 
concentrated vibration energy at the faulted bearing outer race characteristic frequency (46 Hz) is 
less in the case of slight bearing outer race fault (Case 2) than the case of severe bearing outer race 
fault (Case 3).

On the other hand, the same analysis procedure was employed to the cases of faulted bearing 
with inner race defects (Case 4 and 5), and the time-frequency Hilbert spectra and their correspond-
ing marginal Hilbert spectra of the envelope of the first IMF are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respec-
tively.  Except for the common features that the vibration energy concentrates at 12 Hz and 25 Hz, 
the vibration energy concentration can be also observed at the frequency range of 70-80 Hz which is 
corresponding to the bearing characteristic frequency (73 Hz) of inner race defect.  The same as the 
observation in Case 2 and 3, it can be noted that the vibration energy level at the bearing character-
istic frequency of inner race defect is higher in the case of sever bearing inner race defect (Case 5) 
than in the case of slight bearing inner race defect (Case 4).

put features of SVM for classification.  The radial basis function is utilized as the kernel function of 
SVM in this study.  Twenty five data sets of each case, total 150 data sets, of all cases are randomly 
extracted for SVM training, and the remaining 150 data sets are used for testing.  For the purpose of 
comparison, the procedure is repeating for both shaft rotating speeds of 720 and 1020 RPM.  The 
classification results are shown in Table 3 and 4, respectively.  The left columns of the tables repre-
sent the true experimental cases. The top rows represent the corresponding faulted cases the se-
lected features are classified to. The middle arrays of the tables indicate the numbers of data sets in 
experimental cases which are classified to the corresponding faulted cases.  It is noted in these two 
tables that all the testing data sets are identified to the correct corresponding faulted cases except for 
one of the data sets of Case 4.  Conclusively, the vibration patterns of different experimental cases 
can be accurately identified by SVM through the selected features that are analysis results of HHT.
