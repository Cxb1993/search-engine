Abstract 
In this project, a new method is 
proposed to convert an analog signal to 
its corresponding counterpart for the 
discrete-time system. This method is 
suitable for the natural response curve, so 
it can be more effective for some digitally 
redesigned systems. According to the 
mapping region of the transformation via 
proposed method from s-domain to 
z-domain, such a transformation with a 
modulated sine function is used to 
generate a corresponding stable 
discrete-time signal system for a stable 
continuous-time signal system. As a 
suitable modulated parameter in our 
proposed transformation is chosen to 
digitalize an analog system, the new 
sampled-data signal system has a good 
performance for its originally 
continuous-time response, and it also can 
tolerate a comparatively large sampling 
period for sampled-data implementation.   
 
1.  Introduction 
Most of the controller signals are 
designed based on continuous-time 
model for which many theories and 
practical methods have been well 
developed [1, 2]. It is often necessary to 
refit these controllers with digital 
tranceducers and digital electronics for 
practical implementation [3]. For 
effective digital implementation of the 
designed continuous-time controller, the 
continuous-time controller needs to be

There are several well-known 
numerically integrated methods [14] for 
obtaining the value of each 
continuous-time integral term on the 
right-hand side of Eq. (3), such as 
trapezoid (bilinear or Tustin 
transformation) numerical integration 
method, etc. [3,12]. However, according 
to the available sampled data in a 
continuous-time integration, they 
generally form a curve with arc, and these 
arc curves are often similar to the some 
part of a modulated sine function curve. 
Assuming a controlled system is 
described as shown in Fig. 1, where )(tr  
and )(ty  are respectively the input and 
output of the controlled system, and )(te  
and )(tu  are the input and output of the 
controller, respectively. According the 
theorem of the feedback control, the 
transfer functions of

where )()(1)( sPsCs +=Δ . From above 
equations, it is shown they have same 
characteristic equation )(sΔ , it means 
they have same characteristic roots. If the 
controlled system is stable, the 
characteristic roots of characteristic 
equation must locate in the left-half 
region of the s-plane, and the negative 
real part of characteristic roots will make 
the time-domain responses of )(ty , )(tu

modulated curve area 2A  and tA  is 
shown. The horizontal coordinate value 
of point b and point e are with 0=t  and 
Tt = , respectively, and let point c be the 
corresponding point on a modulated sine 
function )sin(nt  with Tt = , where n is 
the modulated parameter. The triangle 
area tA  can be obtained as

In the case of another possible stable 
response as shown in Fig. 2b, the 
evaluated area can be obtained by 
subtracting the downward sine area 2A′  
(area ebc ′ with dash arc) from the 
rectangle area 1A  (area deab ′ ). Area

It is seen that the transformation via the 
modulated sine function method can map 
the left half of the s-plane into a circle 
region with center point ( )0,cσ  and 
radius r on the z-plane. As π<< nT0 , 
the range of the mapping radius is 
10 << r , the range of cσ  is 10 << cσ , 
and the mapping region (with dash circle) 
of the z-plane is inner the unit circle as 
shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, under 
satisfying the restricted condition of 
π<< nT0 , any suitable modulated 
parameter n can be applied on the 
proposed transformation which can be 
used to produce a stable discrete-time 
controller for a stable continuous-time 
controller.
