cycle is a closed path with at least three vertices such that the first vertex is the same as the last one.  
The length of a path P, denoted by l(P), is the number of edges in P.  A cycle of length m is 
denoted by Cm.  For any two vertices u and v of G, the distance between u and v, denoted by dG(u, 
v), is the length of the shortest path in G.  The diameter of G is the maximum distance among all 
dG(u, v) for any pair of vertices u and v. 
     Network topology is essential for parallel and distributed computation, and it determines the 
performance of a network.  Many topologies, such as the hypercube, the butterfly graph, and the 
star graph, have been proposed [13].  Among these topologies, the hypercube is one of the most 
popular networks since it has attractive properties including regularity, symmetry, small diameter, 
strong connectivity, recursive construction, partitionability, and relatively low link complexity [1, 
12].  However, there are still some different points of view to construct new topologies.  For 
example, the crossed cube is derived by changing some connections from the hypercube [4].  The 
crossed cube has a structure similar to that of the hypercube including recursive structure, the same 
number of vertices, and the same number of edges; however, it supports a better performance in 
some ways than that of the hypercube [5].  In [4], Efe proved that the diameter of the crossed cube 
is better than that of the hypercube if the dimensions are the same. 
     Let Qn and CQn respectively denote the hypercube and the crossed cube of dimension n with 
2
n
 vertices.  In [8], Hsu et al. proved that, for any two white vertices u and x and any two black 
vertices v and y of Qn, there are two disjoint paths P1 and P2 such that (1) P1 is a path joining u to v, 
(2) P2 is a path joining x to y, and (3) P1  P2 spans Qn.  Such property is called the 2P property.  
In [11], Lee et al. extended the 2P property such that the lengths of P1 and P2 can be any odd 
integers, where l(P1)  dQn(u, v) and l(P2)  dQn(x, y).  This property is called the 2RP property 
which is described more precisely below.  Assume that n  4.  Let u and x (v and y, respectively) 
be two distinct white (black, respectively) vertices of Qn.  Let l1 and l2 be odd integers with l1  
dQn(u, v), l2  dQn(x, y), and l1 + l2 = 2
n
 – 2.  Moreover, let l3 and l4 be even integers with l3  dQn(u, 
x), l4  dQn(v, y), and l3 + l4 = 2
n
 – 2 except the case that {l3, l4} = {2, 2
n
 – 4} and {u, x, v, y} 
induces a C4.  Then, there are two disjoint paths P1 and P2 such that (1) P1 is a path joining u to v 
with l(P1) = l1, (2) P2 is a path joining x to y with l(P2) = l2, and (3) P1  P2 spans Qn.  
Furthermore, there are two disjoint paths P3 and P4 such that (1) P3 is a path joining u to x with l(P3) 
= l3, (2) P4 is a path joining v to y with l(P4) = l4, and (3) P3  P4 spans Qn. 
     In this study, we discuss the 2RP property for the crossed cube.  Assume that n is a positive 
integer of n  5.  Let u, v, x, and y be four different vertices of CQn.  Moreover, let l1 and l2 be 
any two integers with l1 + l2 = 2
n
 – 2, where n  l1 and n  l2.  Then, there exist two disjoint paths 
P1 and P2 such that (1) P1 is a path joining u and v with l(P1) = l1, (2) P2 is a path joining x and y 
with l(P2) = l2, (3) P1  P2 spans CQn. 
     The rest of this study is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we define a crossed cube and 
introduce some of its properties.  In Section 3, we prove that there exist two required spanning 
paths in a crossed cube.  Finally, in Section 4, we give some applications of this study.

Hamiltonicity problem that determines the maximum integer k such that G – F remains Hamiltonian 
for every F  (V(G)  E(G)) with |F|  k if G is Hamiltonian.  Similarly, the fault-tolerant 
Hamiltonian connectivity is defined to be the maximum integer k such that G – F remains 
Hamiltonian connected for every F  (V(G)  E(G)) with |F|  k if G is Hamiltonian connected.  
A graph G is k-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian (k-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected, respectively) or 
simply k-Hamiltonian (k-Hamiltonian connected, respectively) if it remains Hamiltonian 
(Hamiltonian connected, respectively) after removing at most k vertices and/or edges. 
     The following lemmas discuss some properties about Hamiltonian paths and Hamiltonian 
connectedness for the crossed cube. 
Lemma 6.  [9] For any integer n, n  3, CQn is (n−2)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and 
(n−3)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected. 
Lemma 7.  [3] Let u and v be any two vertices of CQn, n  4, and let l be any integer with dCQn(u, 
v)  l  2n – 1 and l  dCQn(u, v) + 1.  Then, there exists a Hamiltonian path P of CQn such that 
P(1) = u and P(l + 1) = v. 
Lemma 8.  Let H be a subset of V(CQn), where n  5 and 0  |H|  n.  Besides, let H0 = H  
V(CQ
0 
n−1) and H1 = H  V(CQ
1 
n−1).  If CQ
0 
n−1 – H0 and CQ
1 
n−1 – H1 are both Hamiltonian connected, 
then CQn – H is also Hamiltonian connected.  Moreover, for any two vertices u and v of CQn – H, 
there exists a Hamiltonian path P of CQn – H joining u and v such that P contains a Hamiltonian 
path of CQ
0 
n−1 – H0 or a Hamiltonian path of CQ
1 
n−1 – H1 as its subpath. 
Lemma 9.  Let u be a vertex and (x, y) be an edge of CQn, n  5.  Then, CQn – {u, x, y} is 
Hamiltonian connected. 
Lemma 10.  Let (u, v) and (x, y) be two edges of CQn, n  5.  Then, CQn – {u, v, x, y} is 
Hamiltonian connected. 
Lemma 11.  Let H = u, v, x, y, z be a path of length 4 in CQn, n  7.  Then, CQn – H is 
Hamiltonian connected. 
     Let u be a vertex of CQn and v = (u)
i
 be a neighbor of u, where i < n and i is even.  Then, we 
call such edge (u, v) an even-edge.  As described in Lemma 5, vertices u, v, (u)
n
, and (v)
n
 form a 
C4 in CQn. 
Lemma 12.  Let H be a subset of V(CQn), n  5, where 0  |H|  3 and H forms a path if |H|  2.  
Then, there exists a Hamiltonian path P of CQn – H joining any two vertices of CQn – H such that P 
has at least four even-edges. 
 
3. The existence of two required spanning paths 
     In this section, we will show that a crossed cube can be spanned by two disjoint paths of 
required lengths. 
Theorem 1.  Let u, v, x, and y be any four vertices of CQn, n  5.  Moreover, let l1 and l2 be any 
two integers with l1 + l2 = 2
n
 – 2, where n  l1 and n  l2.  Then, there exist two disjoint paths P1 
and P2 of CQn such that (i) P1 is a path joining u and v with l(P1) = l1, (ii) P2 is a path joining x and 
y with l(P2) = l2, and (iii) P1  P2 spans CQn.

can set P2 = S1, and we can get the other required path P1. 
Case 4.  u  V(CQ0 n–1) and {v, x, y}  V(CQ
1 
n–1).  This case is similar to Case 2 since u and v are 
in different subcubes while x and y are in the same subcube. 
Case 5.  {u, v, x}  V(CQ0 n–1) and y  V(CQ
1 
n–1).  Consider the following subcases. 
  Subcase 5.1.  2n – 1  l2  2
n–1
 – 1.  Let p be a vertex of CQ0 n–1.  By induction, there exist two 
disjoint paths R1 and R2 of CQ
0 
n–1 such that R1  R2 spans CQ
0 
n–1.  Also by induction, there exist two 
disjoint paths S1 and S2 of CQ
1 
n–1 such that S1  S2 spans CQ
1 
n–1.  By setting P2 = x, R1, p, (p)
n
, S1, 
y, we can get the other required path P1. 
  Subcase 5.2.  (x, y)  E(CQn) and n  l2  2n – 2.  By Lemma 2, we have dCQ0 n−1(x, (y)
n
) = 
dCQn(x, y) – 1 or dCQ
1 
n−1
((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1, thus we need to consider the following two 
conditions. 
Condition 5.2.1.  dCQ0 n−1(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1.  By induction, there exist two disjoint paths R1 
and R2 of CQ
0 
n–1 such that R1  R2 spans CQ
0 
n–1.  By Lemma 6, CQ
1 
n–1 is Hamiltonian connected.  
By setting P2 = x, R1, (y)
n
, y, we can obtain the other required path P1. 
Condition 5.2.2.  dCQ1 n−1((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1.  By induction, there exist two disjoint paths S1 
and S2 of CQ
1 
n–1 such that S1  S2 spans CQ
0 
n–1.  By Lemma 6, CQ
0 
n–1 is Hamiltonian connected.  
We set P2 = x, (x)
n
, S1, y.  Then, P1 can be obtained. 
Subcase 5.3.  (x, y)  E(CQn) and n + 1  l2  2n – 2.  Let p be a neighbor of x in CQ
0 
n–1.  By 
Lemma 6, CQ
0 
n–1 is Hamiltonian connected.  By induction, we have two disjoint paths S1 and S2 of 
CQ
1 
n–1 such that S1  S2 spans CQ
1 
n–1.  We set P2 = x, p, (p)
n
, S1, y, and we can find the other 
required path P1. 
Subcase 5.4.  (x, y)  E(CQn) and l2 = n.  Let (x, p) be an even-edge of CQ
0 
n–1.  Then, we can 
find a path R1 of CQ
0 
n–1 joining x and p such that l(R1) =  2
1n ; i.e. |V(R1)| =  2
1n  + 1.  We also 
can find a path S1 of CQ
1 
n–1 joining (p)
n
 and y such that l(S1) =  2
n ; i.e. |V(S1)| =  2
n  + 1.  By 
Lemma 6, there exists a Hamiltonian path R2 of CQ
0 
n–1 – R1.  Similarly, there exists a Hamiltonian 
path S2 of CQ
1 
n–1 – S1.  By setting P2 = x, R1, p, (p)
n
, S1, y, the other required path P1 can be 
found. 
Case 6.  {u, x}  V(CQ0 n–1) and {v, y}  V(CQ
1 
n–1).  There are four subcases that should be 
considered. 
  Subcase 6.1.  2n – 1  l2  2
n–1
 – 1.  Let p be a vertex of CQ0 n–1.  By induction, there exist two 
disjoint paths R1 and R2 of CQ
0 
n–1 such that R1  R2 spans CQ
0 
n–1.  Also by induction, there exist two 
disjoint paths S1 and S2 of CQ
1 
n–1 such that S1  S2 spans CQ
1 
n–1.  We set P2 = x, R1, p, (p)
n
, S1, y.  
Then, the required path P1 can be obtained. 
  Subcase 6.2.  (x, y)  E(CQn) and n  l2  2n – 2.  Consider the following two conditions. 
Condition 6.2.1.  dCQ0 n−1(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1.  By induction, we have two disjoint paths R1 and 
R2 of CQ
0 
n–1 such that R1  R2 spans CQ
0 
n–1.  By Lemma 6, CQ
1 
n–1 is Hamiltonian connected.  We 
set P2 = x, R1, (y)
n
, y, and the other required path P1 can be obtained. 
Condition 6.2.2.  dCQ1 n−1((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1.  By Lemma 6, CQ
0 
n–1 is Hamiltonian connected.

Abstract - A connected graph G is said to be panconnected 
if, for any two distinct vertices x and y of G, it contains a 
path P between x and y such that dP(x, y) = l for any integer 
l satisfying dG(x, y)  l  |V(G)| – 1, where dG(x, y) 
(respectively, dP(x, y)) denotes the distance between x and y 
in G (respectively, P), and |V(G)| denotes the total number 
of vertices of G.  If such path P can be extended to form a 
Hamiltonian path P of G such that P  P, then G is 
hyper-panconnected.  In this paper, we study the property 
of hyper-panconnectedness with respect to the class of 
crossed cubes, which is a popular variant of the hypercube 
network. 
 
Keywords: Panconnected, Hamiltonian path, Crossed cube, 
Interconnection network 
1  Introduction 
     Network topology is essential for parallel and 
distributed computation, and it determines the performance 
of a network.  Among many kinds of network topologies, 
the hypercube [14] is one of the most popular networks 
since it has good properties such as regularity, symmetry, 
small diameter, strong connectivity, recursive construction, 
partitionability, relatively low link complexity, and so on.  
However, the hypercube is bipartite so that it cannot make 
the best use of network resources.  To compensate for this 
drawback, many researchers [1, 5, 6, 15] try to fashion 
networks.  One such network topology is the crossed cube, 
which was first proposed by Efe [7].  The crossed cube is 
derived from the hypercube by changing the connection of 
some links.  Its diameter is about half of the hypercube’s 
* This work is supported in part by the National Science Council of the 
 Republic of China under Contracts NSC98-2218-E-468-001-MY3 and 
 NSC99-2221-E-167-025. 
[4, 7].  Moreover, the crossed cube has additional 
attractive properties.  For example, it has more cycles 
than the hypercube [9], and it can embed binary trees [12], 
paths of odd and even lengths [8, 10], and many-to-many 
disjoint path covers [13].  The definition of the crossed 
cube will be presented in the next section. 
     In terms of network analysis, the topological 
structure can be modeled as a simple graph.  For the graph 
definition and notation, we follow the standard terminology 
given by Bondy and Murty [3].  Let G be an undirected 
graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G).  Two 
vertices x and y of G are adjacent if (x, y)  E(G).  The 
degree of a vertex u is the number of edges incident to u.  
A graph G is k-regular if all its vertices have the same 
degree k.  A graph H is a subgraph of G, denoted by H  
G, if V(H)  V(G) and E(H)  E(G).  Moreover, H is a 
spanning subgraph of G (or H spans G) if V(H) = V(G).  
Let S be a nonempty subset of V(G).  The subgraph of G 
induced by S is a graph whose vertex set is S and whose 
edge set consists of all the edges of G joining any two 
vertices in S.  A path P of length k, k  1, from vertex x to 
vertex y in G is a sequence of distinct vertices v1, v2, . . . , 
vk+1 such that v1 = x, vk+1 = y, and (vi, vi+1)  E(G) for 1  i 
 k.  We can write P as v1, v2, …, vi, Q, vj, …, vk+1 for 
convenience if we know that Q = vi, …, vj, where i  j.  
The reverse of P, denoted by rev(P), is defined as rev(P) = 
vk+1, vk, …, v1.  A single vertex x can be considered as a 
path x of length 0.  The ith vertex of P is denoted by P(i); 
i.e., P(i) = vi.  We use l(P) to denote the length of P.  The 
distance between two distinct vertices x and y in G, denoted 
by dG(x, y), is the length of the shortest path between x and 
y.  A cycle is a closed path with at least three vertices such 
that the last vertex is adjacent to the first one.  For clarity, 
a cycle of length k is represented by Ck = v1, v2, …, vk, v1, 
where k  3. 
Lemma 4. [11] CQn is (n − 2)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian 
and (n − 3)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected for any 
integer n, n  3. 
     In CQn, vertex x = xnxn−1…x1 is adjacent to vertex y = 
ynyn−1…y1 along the ith dimension, 1  i  n, if the 
following four conditions are all satisfied: (i) xi  yi, (ii) xj = 
yj for all j, i+1  j  n, (iii) x2kx2k−1 ~ y2ky2k−1 for all k, 1  k 
  2
1i , and (iv) xi−1 = yi−1 if i is even.  Then, we say that 
x is the i-neighbor of y, and vice versa.  The i-neighbor of 
vertex x is denoted by (x)
i
, and edge (x, (x)
i
) is called the 
i-dimensional edge.  It is easy to see that y = (x)
i
 if and 
only if x = (y)
i
.  According to the adjacency of vertices, we 
can locate C4 and C5 in CQn as described in the following 
lemmas. 
Lemma 5. [9] Let (x, y) be any n-dimensional edge in CQn, 
n  3.  Then, the set of vertices {x, y, (x)2, (y)2} induces a 
C4. 
Lemma 6. [9] Let (x, y) be any n-dimensional edge in CQn, 
n  3.  Then, ((x)1)n = ((y)2)1 = ((y)1)2.  Moreover, (i) the 
set of vertices {x, y, (x)
1
, (y)
2
, ((y)
2
)
1
} induces a C5; (ii) the 
set of vertices {x, y, (x)
1
, (y)
1
, ((y)
1
)
2
} induces a C5. 
     By brute force with a computer program, we have the 
following lemma for CQ4. 
Lemma 7. Let (x, y) be any 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, 
or 4-dimensional edge of CQ4.  Then, CQ4 − {x, y} has a 
Hamiltonian path between two arbitrary vertices. 
     Corollary 1 is drawn from Lemmas 4 and 7. 
Corollary 1. Let (x, y) be any i-dimensional edge of CQn, 
where n  4 and 2  i  n.  Then, CQn − {x, y} has a 
Hamiltonian path between two arbitrary vertices. 
3  The hyper-panconnectedness of CQn 
     In Section 1, we define that a graph G is 
hyper-panconnected if, for any two distinct vertices x and y, 
there exists a Hamiltonian path P of G such that dP(x, y) = l 
for any integer l satisfying dG(x, y)  l  |V(G)| − 1.  For 
convenience, we can consider P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y.  
However, by the definition of the crossed cube, CQn has no 
C3 as a subgraph; thus, there does not exist any path of 
length 2 between any adjacent vertices x and y in CQn.  
For this reason and by Lemma 3, we exclude the cases of 
paths of length dCQn(x, y) + 1 for any two distinct vertices x 
and y, and we present a loose version of the 
hyper-panconnectedness for the crossed cube. 
Theorem 1.  Let x and y be any two distinct vertices of 
CQn, n  4.  Moreover, let l be any integer with dCQn(x, y) 
 l  2n – 1 and l  dCQn(x, y) + 1.  Then, there exists a 
Hamiltonian path P of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(l + 1) 
= y. 
Proof.  This theorem will be shown by induction on n.  
For the induction base CQ4, the correctness can be verified 
by brute force with a computer program.  Suppose that this 
theorem holds for any CQk, 4  k  n − 1.  Then, we will 
show that CQn has a Hamiltonian path P such that P(1) = x 
and P(l + 1) = y.  Without loss of generality, assume that x 
 V(CQ
0 
n−1).  Consider the following three cases. 
Case 1.  y  V(CQ
0 
n−1).  By Lemma 1, we have dCQn(x, y) 
= dCQ
0 
n−1
(x, y). The following three subcases have to be 
considered. 
Subcase 1.1.  2
n−1
 + 1  l  2n − 1.  By Lemma 4, there 
exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ
0 
n−1 joining x to y.  We 
can write path R as x, R1, a, b, R2, y, where a and b are 
two adjacent vertices in CQ
0 
n−1 satisfying l(R1) = l − 2
n−1
 − 1.  
Notice that x = a if l = 2
n−1
 + 1 and b = y if l = 2
n
 − 1.  
Also by Lemma 4, CQ
1 
n−1 has a Hamiltonian path S joining 
(a)
n
 to (y)
n
.  Then, P = x, R1, a, (a)
n
, S, (y)
n
, y, rev(R2), b 
is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y. 
Subcase 1.2.  l = 2
n−1
.  Let a be any vertex in CQ
1 
n−1 
other than (x)
n
 and (y)
n
.  By Lemma 4, there exists a 
Hamiltonian path S of CQ
1 
n−1 − {a} joining (x)
n
 to (y)
n
.  
Similarly, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ
0 
n−1 − {x} 
joining (a)
n
 and y.  Then, P = x, (x)n, S, (y)n, y, R, (a)n, a 
is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(2
n−1
 + 1) = 
y. 
Subcase 1.3.  dCQn(x, y)  l  2
n−1
 – 1 and l  dCQn(x, y) + 
1.  By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian 
path R of CQ
0 
n−1 such that R(1) = x and R(l + 1) = y.  We 
can write path R as x, R1, y, R2, a, where a is some vertex 
of CQ
0 
n−1.  Notice that a = y if l = 2
n−1
 − 1.  By lemma 4, 
there exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ
1 
n−1 joining (a)
n
 to 
Subcase 3.6.  l = 3.  By Lemma 5, vertices x, y, (x)
2
, 
and (y)
2
 induce a C4.  Since CQn is (n − 2)-fault-tolerant 
Hamiltonian by Lemma 4, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle 
C of CQn − {x, (x)
2
, (y)
2
}.  We can write C as y, R, a, y, 
where a is some vertex adjacent to y.  Then, P = x, (x)2, 
(y)
2
, y, R, a is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and 
P(4) = y. 
Subcase 3.7.  l = 1.  By Lemma 4, there exists a 
Hamiltonian path R of CQn – {x} joining y and some vertex 
a, where a  x.  Then, P = x, y, R, a is a Hamiltonian 
path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(2) = y. 
The above completes the proof.        
4  Concluding remarks 
     In a hyper-panconnected graph, we can find a path 
joining any two distinct vertices in a required distance, and 
this path can be further augmented to form a Hamiltonian 
path.  Since there does not exist any path of length 2 
between any two adjacent vertices in the crossed cube, we 
present a loose version of the hyper-panconnectedness for 
the crossed cube in this paper.  Let x and y be any two 
distinct vertices of CQn.  We show that, for any integer l 
with dCQn(x, y)  l  2
n
 – 1 and l  dCQn(x, y) + 1, there exists 
a Hamiltonian path P of CQn such that P(1) = x, P(l + 1) = y, 
and therefore dP(x, y) = l.
