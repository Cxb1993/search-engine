Abstract 
Analysis of dopant and carrier concentration 
near the surface was performed using X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy and Hall 
measurement. The thickness of native oxide 
was quantitatively determined by X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy. The native oxide 
was removed and then another layer of native 
oxide was grown on the silicon substrate. 
The procedure removed surface silicon atoms 
layer by layer and each layer with a thickness 
resolution around one nanometer. Within 
each etching and regrowth period, dopant 
concentration was measured by X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy and carrier 
concentration was monitored by Hall 
measurement. The project revealed the 
diffusion mechanisms near the surface during 
dopant deactivation in ultra-shallow 
junctions. The results will help the 
optimization of transistors.

Introduction 
The series resistance of source /drain 
metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect 
transistors (MOSFETs) is critical to the 
speed of integrated circuits. Therefore, 
heavily doped ultrashallow junctions (USJ) 
are required to achieve low resistance in 
source and drain regions [1]. Rapid annealing 
at high temperatures is used in dopant 
activation. However, dopant deactivation 
occurs during subsequent low-temperature 
processes. Influence of dopant deactivation 
on the carrier density needs to be 
characterized. Differential Hall measurement 
(DHM) has been used to measure active 
dopant profiles. A continuous anodic 
oxidation technique (CAOT) has been 
developed for DHM [2][3]. Hall 
measurement is performed after the removal 
of the anodic oxidized silicon. Carrier 
profiles are then calculated based on the 
residual carrier concentration obtained from 
each Hall measurement. Native oxide was 
also suggested for etching silicon layers [4]. 
However, an average oxidation rate is usually 
assumed for DHM. X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) provides nanometer 
resolution in measuring the thickness of 
native oxide. In this study, we developed a 
DHM technique using XPS to achieve 
nanometer resolution for active dopant 
profiles.  
Experiment 
In order to examine the dependence of 
doping level on the growth rate of native 
oxide, (100) oriented p-type 
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers were used. 
SOI wafers were first oxidized to form a 
3 
According to the DHM results using XPS 
for monitoring the oxide thickness, the 
carrier concentration as a function of the 
depth are shown in Fig. 7. An activation level 
around 1×1021 cm-3 was obtained after laser 
annealing near the surface of the phosphorus 
junction. After deactivation, the carrier 
concentration of the whole profile decayed. 
Carrier profiles before and after deactivation 
decreased sharply at 4.5 and 3.5 nm, 
respectively. The sharp decrease of the 
carrier profile is consistent with the projected 
range of phosphorus after implantation. 
However, the difference in the depth profile 
is around 1 nm between the carrier and 
chemical profiles after annealing. The shape 
of carrier profile remained similar except for 
a dip near the surface. This suggests some 
profile redistribution near the surface during 
deactivation annealing at 500 °C.  
Figure 8 compares normalized XPS 
signals before and after deactivation. Similar 
background Si plasma signals were obtained 
for all profiles. Clear P 2p signals were only 
observed in samples with initial oxide. This 
indicates that most of the phosphorus is near 
the surface. Interestingly, evident increase of 
the intensity of the P 2p signal was observed 
after deactivation. The increase of the XPS 
signal suggests a high chemical concentration 
due to phosphorus uphill diffusion to the 
surface. This confirms evident profile 
redistribution as that observed in DHM 
results during deactivation annealing 500 °C. 
Point defect generation and enhanced tail 
diffusion during phosphorus deactivation was 
reported [5]. However, DHM and XPS 
results indicate that the redistribution of 
active and chemical profiles at the peak 
region cannot be ignored during phosphorus 
deactivation even at 500 °C.  
Conclusions 
A DHM technique was developed using 
XPS to monitor the thickness of native oxide 
grown on phosphorus USJs. The growth rate 
of native oxide on uniform doped SOI 
samples depends on the doping level of 
phosphorus. The initial growth rate was rapid 
while the thickness saturated for long 
exposure times. Therefore, the thickness of 
native oxide was measured by XPS to obtain 
nanometer depth resolution in each etching 
step during DHM analysis. The DHM 
method was applied to measure phosphorus 
deactivation in laser annealed USJs. DHM 
results indicated redistribution of carrier 
profile near the surface due to phosphorus 
deactivation. The redistribution is caused by 
uphill diffusion of phosphorus which resulted 
in the increase of surface phosphorus signals 
after deactivation.
