的 TiNi形狀記憶合金。使用細的元素 Ti粉與 Ni粉、Ti51Ni49的組成與液相燒結方式可
以得到前所未有之密度(達 95.3%)的 TiNi 燒結體。在麻田散體相變態部分，燒結後，
Ti51Ni49的相變態潛熱可以達到31.9J/g，相較於一般發表利用粉末冶金製程所得到的TiNi
都要來得高，甚至接近於一般 TiNi 鑄鍛件所得到的結果。第一個主要的原因是富鈦的
組成會在 TiNi基地中產生 Ti2Ni化合物，能吸收基地中的碳、氮與氧等雜質，藉以純化
TiNi基地。而第二個主要的原因就是 TiNi基地內的 Ti/Ni比率大於 50/50的結果。最後

The second paper was presented by Fu-Cheng Yen, a PhD candidate and the title of the 
paper was “Mechanical Properties and Shape Memory Characteristics of PM Ti-rich TiNi 
Shape Memory Alloys”. This shape memory alloy session was chaired by me, as part of the 
duty for a member of the Technical Program Committee. The main achievement of this study 
is that a record high sintered density for TiNi has been obtained using the processing 
parameters selected in this study. The shape memory characteristics obtained are similar to 
those of the wrought materials. The reasons behind these properties have also been identified. 
 
The proceeding of this conference includes six volumes and about 5,000 pages. The 
conference sells these volumes individually, not free. The field that I am interested in is the 
PIM and thus the proceeding I brought back is Volume 4. The hot topics, judging from the 
papers presented, include PIM, HIP, fatigue, and lean manufacturing. The HIP industry is 
strong and more and more PIM parts are now HIP’ed to enhance the mechanical properties. 
The PIM industry is strong in particular in Germany due to the strong automotive industry, 
and in the Far East due to the strong 3C industry, especially the smart phones and notebook 
computers. The lean manufacturing has become a focus of recent research because of the high 
prices of the nickel and copper, which are the two most commonly used alloying elements for 
PM and PIM. To reduce the manufacturing cost of PM and to remain its competitiveness, low 
Ni and low Cu materials have been developed continuously through the past 5 years and more 
Mn and Cr are now used as the key alloying elements. The focus of the research include the 
optimum amount, and the sintering conditions to resolve the difficulties of sintering 
evaporative Mn and reactive Cr. 
 
The Italian PM industry is stronger than in Taiwan mainly because there are several 
large car, such as Fiat, and motorcycle companies in Italy. There is also a metal powder 
company, Pometon, supplying customers iron and copper powders. When a country has car 
industries, their PM industry is usually healthy since about 70% of the worldwide PM arts are 
used in the car industry and more than 1,000 PM parts or 10-20Kgs PM materials are used in 
every car. In contrast, the PIM industry in Italy is small compared to in Taiwan. Less than 10 
companies are in Italy and the largest one can only be ranked in the second tier in Taiwan. The 
main market is in the car industry and the diamond tools industry. 
 
There are several after-conference tours. The one I went to is the factory of Maserati 
located at about two-hours drive from Florence. The factory is small and the production line is

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF POWDER INJECTION MOULDED 17-4 PH SINTERED IN 
DISSOCIATED AMMONIA

ABSTRACT 
The mechanical properties of powder injection moulded 17-4 PH stainless steels sintered 
in dissociated ammonia, vacuum, and hydrogen are compared in this study. When sintered in 
dissociated ammonia, more austenite forms and the density is lowered because the dissolved 
nitrogen reduces the δ-ferrite amount and slows down the diffusion rate of iron. This problem 
is resolved by increasing the sintering temperature from 1320 to 1350 ℃, and by adding 1% 
Mo, which is a ferrite stabilizer, to negate the nitrogen effect. With improved sintered density 
and the solution-strengthening effect by nitrogen, the hardness, tensile strength, and ductility 
of aged tensile test specimens are 45 HRC, 1350 MPa, and 2.5%, respectively. The relevant 
changes in microstructure, phase diagram, and sintering behavior caused by the sintering 
atmosphere and Mo addition and the consequential effects on mechanical properties are 
discussed. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Powder injection moulded (PIM) 17-4 PH stainless steel is typically sintered in the dual 
phase region of δ+γ under hydrogen or vacuum to attain high sintered density and good 
corrosion resistance. To reduce manufacturing costs and to take advantage of the nitrogen 
strengthening effect, it is promising to use a continuous furnace, either pusher or walking 
beam types, with an economical atmosphere of dissociated ammonia (DA). Strengthening by 
solid solutioning of nitrogen has been widely used in high-nitrogen stainless steels [1-3]. The 
dissolved nitrogen can also reduce the grain size of austenite, which improves the mechanical 
properties [4,5]. Although it is beneficial to use low cost DA to sinter stainless steels, the high 
amounts of nitrogen dissolved in the matrix during sintering could reduce the fractions of the 
δ-ferrite, which impairs densification due to the higher diffusion rate of iron in the bcc structure 
than in the fcc [6-9]. In addition, the dissolved nitrogen may form chromium nitride, Cr2N, at 
grain boundaries and within grains if the cooling rate is not fast enough. This compound 
formation develops Cr-lean areas around Cr2N particles and seriously deteriorates the 
corrosion resistance [10-12]. Fortunately, most sintered 17-4 PH stainless steels are 
solutioned and then aged. With the fast quenching process after solutioning and low 
temperature aging, the amount and size of the compound can be reduced. The small amount 
of niobium in the 17-4 PH also helps reduce the formation of Cr2N by primarily forming NbN. 
Thus, it is possible that economical DA can be employed if correct processing parameters and 
materials are used. Since the studies of using DA are still very limited, the objective of this 
study is thus to compare the effects of vacuum, hydrogen, and DA on the sintered density and 
mechanical properties. The relevant changes in sintered properties are also discussed with a 
focus on the effects of nitrogen and Mo on the phase diagram, fractions of phases, and 
microstructure. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
The base powder used in this study was water atomized 17-4 PH stainless steel powder, 
with irregular shape and a pycnometer density of 7.80 g/cm3. The particle size distribution was 
D10=4.5 µm, D50=10.2 µm, and D90=29.8 µm. The molybdenum powder used had a 
Pycnometer density of 10.15g/cm3 and a mean particle size of 7.3 µm. To prepare PIM 
specimens, the 17-4 PH and molybdenum powders were kneaded with 7 mass% wax-based 
binder, which consisted of paraffin wax (PW), stearic acid (SA) and polyethylene (PE), using a 
Σ-blade kneading machine. The resulting feedstock was molded into tensile test specimens

To understand the effects of nitrogen and Mo on the densification behavior, dilatometer 
tests were performed for 17-4 PH in hydrogen, 17-4 PH in DA, and 17-4 PH+1Mo in DA. 
Figure 1 shows that the densification of 17-4 PH specimen became significant at about 1000 
℃ when sintered in hydrogen. When the atmosphere was switched from hydrogen to DA, the 
densification was delayed to about 1200 ℃. After adding 1% Mo, the beginning temperature 
for densification in DA decreased to about 1100 ℃. The temperatures where the δ phase 
formed in these three materials were also calculated using the Thermo-Calc software and are 
marked in Figure 1. The agreement of the δ phase formation temperature and the 
densification point suggest that the δ-ferrite formation is the key factor in the densification of 
17-4 PH stainless steel. 
Although sintering in dissociated ammonia decreased the amount of ferrite and increased 
the amount of austenite during sintering, the as-sintered specimen contained little austenite at 
room temperature. The x-ray diffraction patterns, as shown in Figure 2, indicate that all 
specimens, regardless of the sintering atmosphere or the Mo addition, consisted of only 
δ-ferrite and martensite. No fcc peaks are detected. Thus, the mechanical properties will be 
determined by the fractions and properties of ferrite and martensite.

Microstructure 
Figure 6 shows the typical microstructures of the 17-4 PH specimen sintered in vacuum, 
hydrogen, and DA. It was observed that sintering in DA produced more martensite and less 
δ-ferrite. In addition, the hardness of the martensite, 343 HV, is much higher than those of 
 7
CONCLUSIONS 
When 17-4 PH stainless steel is sintered at 1320 ℃ for 2 hours in dissociated ammonia, 
the density is only 94%, lower than the 97% of those sintered in vacuum and hydrogen. By 
adding 1% Mo or by increasing the temperature to 1350 ℃, the sintered density can also be 
raised to 97% due to the increase in the amount of δ-ferrite. With improved density and 
nitrogen strengthening, the specimens produced using these two methods can attain a 
hardness of 45 HRC and a tensile strength of 1350 MPa after aging, both of which are higher 
than possible with sintering in vacuum or hydrogen.

Table 1. Characteristics of the elemental Ti and Ni powders used in this study. 
 
Ti powder was mixed with Ni powder in the atomic ratio of 51/49 for 8 hours using a 
Turbula mixer. The resultant admixed powders were compacted into tensile bars with a gage 
length of 10 mm under a pressure of 240 MPa. The green density was 66% of theoretical 
density, which is close to that used for the powder injection molding process. The sintering 
was performed in a vacuum furnace with graphite heaters and insulating felt. The specimens 
were heated to 932 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min, followed by heating at a rate of 2 ℃/min 
to 1280 ℃, and sintering at that temperature for 2 hours under a vacuum of 5.5×10-5 torr. To 
reduce the carbon contamination, no binder or lubricant was used during compaction and the 
compacts were surrounded by Ti powders during sintering, which acted as getters for 
interstitials. 
In order to obtain fully dense PM TiNi SMAs, specimens with a density great than 95% 
were further hot isostatically pressed (HIP). Since these specimens had few interconnected 
open pores, no container was used. The as-sintered specimens were heated to 1162 ℃ and 
then held for 3 hours and 15 minutes in argon under a pressure of 103 MPa. Since as-sintered 
and as-HIPed specimens showed network-like Ti2Ni at grain boundaries, as a result of 
peritectic reaction during cooling, annealing treatment was employed to improve the 
morphologies and distributions of the compound and the tensile properties. The specimens 
were heated to 1004 ℃ and then held for 24 hours under a vacuum of 5.5×10-5 torr. 
 
Materials Characterizations 
The density of sintered compacts was measured using the Archimedes’ method. Since 
martensitic transformation behavior of TiNi SMA [4-6] is greatly influenced by the impurity 
contents, the amounts of interstitials were measured. The C content was tested using a C/S 
analyzer and O and N contents were measured using an O/N analyzer. For microstructure 
analysis, specimens were prepared following the standard grinding and polishing procedure 
and were examined using an optical microscope and a field emission scanning electron 
microscope. The grain size of the TiNi matrix, amount of Ti2Ni phase, and particle size of the 
Ti2Ni dispersoids were measured using the line intercept method. The transformation 
temperature, including start, peak, and finish temperature (Ms, Mp, and Mf for martensite, As, 
Ap, and Af for austenite), and enthalpy were characterized and quantified using a differential 
scanning calorimeter. The heating and cooling rates were fixed at 10 ℃/min. The shape 
memory characteristics were evaluated with bending test [7] and the tensile properties and 
fracture behavior were analyzed using a Shimadzu tensile testing machine.

Martensitic Transformation Behavior and Shape Memory Characteristics 
The interstitial atoms, in particular C, N, and O can easily react with Ti to form TiC, TiN, 
and TiO2, which reduces the Ti content in the TiNi matrix and causes adverse effects on 
martensitic transformation behavior [4-6]. The amounts of C, N, and O in the specimens were 
thus closely monitored. Table 3 shows the contents of these elements after sintering, 
annealing, and HIPing. The data show that there was very little pickup for these elements 
during annealing and HIPing.

Figure 2 shows the effect of annealing and HIPing on the shape memory characteristics 
of PM Ti51Ni49 SMA using DSC. The A→M peak of the sintered-and-annealed specimen was 
slightly narrower (Ms-Mf) than that of the as-sintered specimen. The transformation enthalpy, 
∆H, also increased slightly. Both these changes indicate that annealing improved the shape 
memory effects. The HIPing process also gave narrower A→M peak and higher ∆H, because 
HIPing can be treated as an annealing process, except that the temperature is higher and the 
annealing time shorter. When HIPed specimen was further annealed, the width of the A→M 
peak and the ∆H did not change much.

Ti2Ni strips shown in the HIPed specimen (Figure 6c) also disappeared (Figure 6d). As a 
result, the tensile strength increased by 6 and 10% for as-sintered and HIPed tensile bars, 
respectively; the elongation increased by 40% and 39%, respectively. The fracture surface of 
annealed specimens also showed more dimples and fewer intergranular fractures, as shown

Therefore, in the ﬁrst phase of this study, the primary
objective was to examine the eﬀects of Ti/Ni ratio with
titanium content ranging from 50 to 55 at. pct and
sintering temperature ranging from 1173 K to 1573 K
(900 C to 1300 C) on density and martensitic trans-
formation temperature and enthalpy. With a better
understanding of the eﬀects of the Ti/Ni ratio on the
density and shape memory eﬀects, the heating schedule
and sintering temperature were modiﬁed in the second
phase of the study. The sintering was performed on
Ti51Ni49, as determined from the results of the ﬁrst
phase experiment.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Fine elemental titanium powders (TILOP-45, OSAKA
Titanium Technologies Co., Ltd., Tokyo) and nickel
powders (T-123, Inco Co., Mississauga, Canada) with
mean particle sizes of 27.2 and 3.7 lm, respectively, were
selected for this study. The Ti powder was produced
using gas atomization, and thus, the contents of carbon,
oxygen, and nitrogen were low. The Ni powder was
produced by decomposing Ni-carbonyl, so the carbon
content was slightly higher than that in the Ti powder. Its
oxygen content was also higher due to its spiky shape
and large surface area. The characteristics of these two
powders are given in Table I.
To prepare the compacts, Ti powder was mixed for
8 hours with diﬀerent amounts of Ni powder in the
Ti/Ni atomic ratios from 50/50 to 55/45 using a Turbula
mixer (T2C, Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik,
Basel, Switzerland). The resultant admixed powders
were compacted uniaxially into round discs, 13.33 mm
in diameter and 3.38 mm in thickness, with a pressure of
200 to 250 MPa. The green density was 66 pct of
theoretical density, which is similar to that used for the
powder injection molding process. The green compacts
were surrounded by Ti powder, which served as carbon,
oxygen, and nitrogen getters, during sintering in a
vacuum furnace with graphite heaters and graphite
insulation felts. The samples were heated at 5 K/min
under a vacuum of 6.67 9 103 Pa to the designated
temperature and then sintered for 2 hours.
The sintered density was measured using the Archi-
medes’ method, and the reported data are averages of at
least ﬁve measurements. The total amounts of C, O, and
N in the as-received powders and sintered parts were
measured for C content using a carbon/sulfur analyzer
(EMIA-220V, HORIBA Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and for O
and N content using an oxygen/nitrogen analyzer
(TC-136, LECO Co., St. Joseph, MI). The surface
morphology of each sintered specimen was examined
using a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope
(LEO-1530, LEO ElectronMicroscopy Ltd., Cambridge,
United Kingdom). For microstructure analysis, speci-
mens were prepared following the standard grinding and
polishing procedure. The chemical composition of each
phase in the sintered compact was examined using an
electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JXA-8200SX,
JEOL Ltd., Tokyo). The amounts of diﬀerent phases
were measured using the line intercept method. To
identify the B19’ phase (martensite) and traces of other
phases at room temperature, a high power monochro-
matized X-ray diﬀractometer (TTRAXIII, Rigaku Co.,
Tokyo) with Cu radiation (k = 1.542 A˚) was employed
using an acceleration voltage of 50 kV and working
current of 300 mA. The precision of the 2h angle of the
diﬀraction lines, calibrated using a polycrystalline Si
standard, was better than 0.02 deg. Since the diﬀraction
lines of B19’, Ti2Ni, and Ti4Ni2X (X = C, N, O) are
very close, a small scanning step size of 0.01 deg and a
slow scanning rate of 1 deg/min were employed to
obtain better resolution of diﬀraction lines. The trans-
formation temperature, including start, peak, and ﬁnish
temperatures (Ms, Mp, and Mf for martensite; As, Ap,
and Af for austenite), and enthalpy were quantiﬁed
using a diﬀerential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Q10,
TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). The heating and
cooling rates were ﬁxed at 10 K/min. The reported data
on martensitic transformation properties are averages of
at least three measurements.
III. RESULTS
A. Sintered Density
To determine which temperature range should be used
for the ﬁne elemental Ti and Ni powders—below the
Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic temperature of 1215 K (942 C),
between 1215 K (942 C) and the Ti2Ni peritectic
temperature of 1257 K (984 C), between 1257 K
(984 C) and the TiNi-TiNi3 eutectic temperature of
1391 K (1118 C), or above 1391 K (1118 C) (Fig-
ure 1)—a preliminary test was carried out using Ti50Ni50
and Ti52Ni48 compositions. Specimens were heated at
5 K/min to the designated temperature and then held at
that temperature for 10 minutes, followed by furnace
cooling. Figure 2 indicates that the sintered densities
had a signiﬁcant drop above the eutectic temperature of
1215 K (942 C), irrespective of the Ti content. As the

could be Ti2Ni and Ti4Ni2X (X = C, N, O). Since the
structures of the Ti2Ni and Ti4Ni2X are face-centered-
cubic and their lattice parameters are very close with the
diﬀerence in 2h value of about 0.1 deg, the diﬀerentia-
tion between these two phases is quite diﬃcult even with
a small scanning step size of 0.01 deg and a slow
scanning rate of 1 deg/min for the X-ray diﬀractome-
ter.[19–21] Thus, no ﬁrm identiﬁcation could be made
using X-ray diﬀractometry.
Figure 6 also shows a small amount of TiC and
Ti2Ni/Ti4Ni2X phase in the Ti50Ni50 compact. As the
Ti content increased, TiC peaks disappeared in the
Ti51Ni49 and Ti55Ni45; only TiNi and Ti2Ni/Ti4Ni2X
phases were observed. This indicated that the distribu-
tion of carbon was quite diﬀerent in these sintered
compacts, depending on the Ti content. The X-ray
diﬀraction patterns also show that both B2 and B19’
phases were present in Ti50Ni50. This suggests that the
martensitic transformation was incomplete during
cooling. In contrast, other samples did not show any
B2 peaks, indicating that the B2 phase had trans-
formed completely to the B19’ phase, as was conﬁrmed
later by the DSC analysis.
To further identify the gray and dark gray phases, the
amounts of Ti, Ni, C, and O in these diﬀerent areas were
measured using the EPMA. The measurement of N was
neglected because the total amount of nitrogen was less
than 0.003 wt pct. Table II shows that the amount of O
in the dark gray area was the highest, followed by that in
the gray and white areas. The amount of C in the dark
gray area was also the highest, but in the white and gray
areas, the amounts were almost the same. Although
these EPMA measurements for C and O are not very
accurate, as can be cross-checked by their total amount
measured by the carbon and oxygen analyzer, as shown
in Section C, these data still provide valuable informa-
tion on the relative scale of the concentrations of C and
O in the white, gray, and dark gray areas.

surfaces and almost all of the nickel oxide and dissolved
oxygen in the Ni powder can be reduced during high
vacuum sintering.
Figures 9(a) and (b) show the cooling and heating
DSC curves of the sintered TiNi compacts, respectively.
TheMs,Mp,Mf, and DHM observed during cooling and
the As, Ap, Af, and DHA during the reverse phase
transformation are also summarized in Tables III and
IV, respectively. The highest DHM of 30.6 J/g was
produced by Ti51Ni49, and its Ms and Mp temperatures
were 349.5 K and 332.1 K (76.5 C and 59.1 C),
respectively. The enthalpy of 30.6 J/g measured from
the Ti51Ni49 specimen is probably the highest DH
reported to date for sintered TiNi compacts and is
approaching the highest enthalpy of 35 J/g reported to
date for wrought TiNi.[9] The Ms and Mp temperatures
are similar to or even higher than those of the wrought
TiNi fabricated by vacuum induction melting and
electron beam melting.[5,8–12]
Figure 9(a) and Table III also show that the Mf of
Ti50Ni50 is 283.2 K (10.2 C), which is lower than the
testing temperature of 295 K (22 C). As a result, the
martensitic transformation of Ti50Ni50 would not be
complete. This result is in agreement with the X-ray
diﬀraction patterns shown in Figure 6, which indicate
that the austenitic B2 phase was present. As the Ti
content increased, theMf increased and was higher than
the testing temperature. Thus, no B2 phase was detected
in these samples. It is believed that whether the
transformation is complete or not depends on the
distribution and amount of the interstitials in the TiNi,
which are demonstrated in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
D. Effect of Ti Content on Martensitic Transformation
Behavior
The EPMA results, as illustrated in Figure 10, showed
that the Ti concentration in the TiNi matrix remained at
about 50.5 at. pct as the total Ti content increased
beyond 51 at. pct. This suggests that the solubility of the
Ti in the TiNi matrix was about 50.5 at. pct and that the
extra Ti over the solubility limit formed Ti2Ni. Since the
Ti/Ni ratio in the matrix of the TiNi compacts, except
for Ti50Ni50, remained at about 50.5/49.5, the transfor-
mation temperatures of the Ti-rich alloys were similar,
as shown in Figure 10 and Table III. These correlations
also applied for reverse transformation temperatures
(As, Ap, and Af) and transformation temperature inter-
vals (Af -As) during heating, as shown in Table IV.
The other factor that inﬂuences the transformation
heat is the total amount of TiNi in the specimen. When
the Ti content is greater than 51 at. pct, the amount of
TiNi decreases almost linearly with the increasing Ti
content due to the increase of the Ti2Ni/Ti4Ni2X phase,
as shown in Figure 11. Combining these two factors, the
Ti/Ni ratio in the matrix and the amount of TiNi, the
DH ﬁrst increased and then decreased as the Ti content
increased, as depicted in Figure 12, and the maximum
DH of 30.6 J/g occurred in Ti51Ni49. It was noticed that
this DH did not decrease proportionally with the
decreasing amount of TiNi. For example, as the TiNi
content decreased from 96 wt pct in the Ti51Ni49 to
68 wt pct in the Ti55Ni45, the DH only decreased from
30.6 to 23.7 J/g. This resulted in an increasing speciﬁc
DH (joule per gram of TiNi), as shown in Figure 12. The
speciﬁc latent heat achieved with Ti55Ni45 was 35.0 J/g,
the same as that of wrought TiNi. The main reason is

TiNi matrix, which are prone to form carbides and
oxides with titanium and decrease the Ti/Ni ratio in the
matrix.[5,6] Thus, low Ms, low DH, incomplete martens-
itic transformation, and wide DSC peaks, as compared
to those of the high purity TiNi, were observed in the
PM Ti50Ni50, as shown in Figure 9 and Table III. It was
noticed in Figure 9, however, that when the Ti content
was greater than 51 at. pct, the width of the DSC peak
narrowed and the Ms increased. One reasonable expla-
nation is that the extra Ti in the Ti-rich TiNi alloy forms
stable Ti2Ni compounds whose fcc structure can accom-
modate large amounts of residual carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen, up to about 14 at. pct when Ti4Ni2C, Ti4Ni2O,
and Ti4Ni2N form.
[19,20] This was conﬁrmed by the
X-ray mapping in Figure 7, which shows that high
amounts of C and O were dissolved in the Ti2Ni phase
and that the oxygen content in the Ti2Ni was much
larger than that in the TiNi matrix. Thus, the high
Ti/Ni ratio and low C and O in the TiNi matrix of
Ti51Ni49 could be maintained. Another conﬁrmation
was that the TiC peak in the X-ray diﬀraction pattern
of the Ti50Ni50, as shown in Figure 6, disappeared in
the Ti51Ni49 compact because carbon was dissolved in
the Ti2Ni compounds. Since Ti51Ni49 had about
4.4 wt pct Ti2Ni to absorb interstitials, the concentra-
tions of C and O in the TiNi matrix must be low. Thus,
with low interstitial contents and high Ti content of
about 50.5 at. pct in the TiNi matrix, the martensitic
transformation temperature measured in the Ti51Ni49
specimen was comparable to those of wrought TiNi
alloys, which contain very low amounts of C, O, and N,
usually less than 0.1 wt pct total. With a clean TiNi
matrix, it was not surprising either to see in Table III
that the highest speciﬁc DH for Ti55Ni45 sintered at
1411 K (1138 C) is the same as the highest DH of

Ti2Ni phase and deteriorate the shape memory eﬀect
and ductility.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The conclusions deduced from the results of this study
of PM TiNi SMAs can be summarized as follows.
1. With ﬁne Ti and Ni powders and persistent liquid-
phase sintering at 1553 K (1280 C), a Ti51Ni49
specimen can reach a density of 95.3 pct, Ms of
347.1 K (74.1 C), and DH of 31.9 J/g, which are
comparable to those of wrought TiNi.
2. The extra Ti over the equiatomic portion in the
TiNi compact serves three purposes. (a) It forms
Ti2Ni compounds that act as getters for interstitials.
(b) It maintains a high Ti/Ni ratio, above 50/50, in
the TiNi matrix. (c) It forms a suﬃcient quantity of
liquid phase to cause densiﬁcation by persistent li-
quid-phase-sintering mechanisms.
3. When the Ti content in the specimen was in excess
of 51 at. pct, the transformation start, peak, and
ﬁnish temperatures (Ms, Mp, and Mf) remained the
same because the Ti/Ni ratio in the TiNi matrix did
not change. However, the DH decreased because
the amount of Ti2Ni increased at the expense of
TiNi. Nonetheless, the specific DH (J/g TiNi) in-
creased because the C, O, and N in the TiNi matrix
were trapped more completely by the increasing
amount of Ti2Ni. The specific latent heat in
Ti55Ni45 can achieve 35.0 J/g, the same as that of
wrought TiNi.
4. The criteria for the optimum Ti content are to have
the minimum amount of overequiatomic Ti to form
Ti2Ni and trap the C, O, and N while keeping the
amount of Ti2Ni to a minimum and to provide suf-
ﬁcient liquid during persistent liquid-phase sintering
in the liquid+TiNi region.

a b s t r a c t
Through the use of ﬁne titanium and nickel elemental powders and persistent liquid phase sintering, a
high density powder metal Ti51Ni49 with a high phase transformation temperature and enthalpy, and
narrow transformation hysteresis, which are comparable to those of wrought TiNi alloys, are produced.
However, due to the presence of a semi-continuous Ti2Ni network, the shape recovery and tensile prop-
erties in themartensitic state at room temperature, determined using bending tests, are lower than those
of cast TiNi counterparts. Through hot isostatic pressing and annealing above the peritectic temperature
for sintered specimens, these properties are improved due to the increase in density and spheroidization
of the Ti2Ni compound. The phase transformation temperature and enthalpy are also enhanced due to
the continuing carbon absorption by the Ti4Ni2X (X=C, O) phase, which decreases the carbon content in
the TiNi matrix.

1. Introduction
TiNi shape memory alloys (SMAs) have been widely used in
automotive, aeronautic, chemical, and medical engineering appli-
cationsdue to their unique shapememory characteristics, excellent
mechanical performances, high corrosion resistance, and good
biocompactability [1]. Commercial TiNiproducts are typically fabri-
cated by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and vacuum induced melting
(VIM), which entail the problems of poor machinability, large
amounts of machining waste, difﬁculties in plastic deformation,
and high processing costs [2]. In contrast, powder metallurgy (PM)
technology allows economical production of net-shaped prod-
ucts without the need for machining and deformation operations.
Nonetheless, PM TiNi has its own problems. Previous studies [3–7]
have shown that a sintered density greater than 90% is difﬁcult to
achieve using the press-and-sintermethod for several reasons: for-
mation of Kirkendall pores due to unbalanced Ti/Ni interdiffusion
rates; melting of Ti above the Ti–Ti2Ni eutectic temperature, leav-
ing large pores at original Ti powder sites; and gases formed during
heating as a result of intense Ti/Ni exothermic reactions.With a low
sintered density, non-uniform microstructure, and heavy contam-
ination with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, only a few PM TiNi with
modest martensitic transformation heat have been reported [8].
With the use of ﬁne elemental Ti and Ni powders, a slightly high
Ti composition, and persistent liquid phase sintering, the authors

have demonstrated that these problems can be resolved [9,10]. A
highdensityTi51Ni49 compactwithmore than95%sintereddensity,
low impurity content (C <400ppm, N<40ppm, and O<1000ppm),
and good martensitic transformation enthalpy of 30.7 J/g can be
achieved through the conventional press-and-sinter method [9].
However, when these Ti51Ni49 alloys cool through the peritectic
reaction temperature of 984 ◦C, as shown in Fig. 1 of the Ti–Ni
phase diagram, the intrinsically hard and brittle Ti2Ni phase pre-
cipitates at grain boundaries, which deteriorates the mechanical
properties and restricts their engineering applications [11]. For
wrought Ti-rich TiNi alloys, the Ti2Ni phase can be eliminated by
homogenization treatment if the titanium content is still within
the solubility limit or its shape can be modiﬁed into ﬁne disper-
soids through repeated thermal–mechanical treatment and the
resulting tensile properties are much improved so that the ten-
sile strength and elongation of Ti-rich TiNi alloys can still exceed
800MPa and 20%, respectively [12–14]. However, the beneﬁts of
thermo-mechanical treatment for PMTi-rich TiNi compacts are not
appealing because PM parts are usually net-shaped, with complex
geometries. Thus, post-sinteringheat treatment couldbeapractical
way to resolve the problems caused by Ti2Ni precipitates.
In previous studies [15], Zhang et al. reported that the Ti51Ni49
alloys fabricated using VAR without rolling showed improved
shape memory characteristics after annealing at 850 ◦C for 2h.
However, Ti2Ni networks were observed at grain boundaries, indi-
cating that the annealing temperature was not high enough [15].
The Ni-rich and equiatomic TiNi alloys also showed a small amount
of Ti2Ni at prior particle surfaces when prealloyed TiNi powders
were sintered and subsequently hot isostatically pressed (HIPed)

tribution of the Ti2Ni compounds are critical for the mechanical
properties of TiNi SMAs. Thus, the objective of this study was to
eliminate or reduce the amount of Ti2Ni phase and to modify its
morphology, in particular the compounds at the grain boundaries,
in order to further improve the shape memory and mechanical
properties of Ti-rich TiNi compacts. Both container-less HIPing
and annealing were employed on high density Ti51Ni49 sintered
compacts that contained few interconnected pores. In this paper,
the tensile properties and fracture behaviors are examined, and
the effect of HIPing and annealing on the tensile properties is
discussed. The martensitic transformation behavior and one-way
shape memory property of these high density PM TiNi alloys were
also measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
bending tests, respectively. These results are compared to those of
the wrought TiNi alloys.

2. Experimental procedure
Carbonyl nickel powder (T-123, Inco Co., Mississauga, Canada)
with a spiky shape and a mean particle size of 3.7m was selected
for this study. Since titanium powders (TILOP-45, OSAKA Titanium
Technologies Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) may melt and ﬂow into ﬁne
capillaries when heated above the Ti–Ti2Ni eutectic temperature,
leaving pores at the original Ti powder sites that are too large to
densify in later sintering stages, relativelyﬁnegas atomizedTi pow-
der with low oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon contents and a mean
particle size of 27.2m was used. More details on the characteris-
tics of these elemental Ti and Ni powders are given in Table 1.
To prepare tensile test specimens, Ti powder was ﬁrst mixed
with Ni powder in the atomic ratio of 51/49 for 8h using a Tur-

bula mixer (T2C, Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik, Basel,
Switzerland), followed by compacting the admixed powders into
tensile bars with a gage length of 10mm and a cross-section of
3.08mm×3.12mm using a hydraulic press under a pressure of
240MPa. The green density was 66% of theoretical density. The
specimens were heated to 932 ◦C at a heating rate of 10 ◦Cmin−1,
followed by heating at a rate of 2 ◦Cmin−1 to 1280 ◦C, and sintered
at that temperature for 2h under a vacuum of 6.67×10−3 Pa. To
reduce the carbon contamination, no binder was used during com-
paction, and the compacts were surrounded by Ti powders during
sintering, which acted as getters for interstitials in the furnace.
In order to obtain fully dense PM TiNi SMAs, specimens with
a density greater than 95% were further hot isostatically pressed.
Since these specimens had few interconnected open pores, no con-
tainer was used in order to prevent contamination due to contact
between the TiNi and container materials. The as-sintered speci-
mens were heated to 1162 ◦C and then held for 3h and 15min in
argon under a pressure of 103MPa. Since as-sintered and HIPed
specimens showed network-like Ti2Ni at grain boundaries, as a
result of peritectic reaction during cooling, spheroidization anneal-
ing treatment was employed to each specimen to improve the
morphologies and distributions of the compound and the tensile
properties. The specimens were heated at 10 ◦Cmin−1 to three
annealing temperatures, 932 ◦C, 964 ◦C, and 1004 ◦C and then held
at these temperatures for 24h under a vacuum of 6.67×10−3 Pa.
The density of sintered compacts was measured using the
Archimedes’ method. To understand the effect of titanium content
on sintered density, the amount of liquid phase was established
using the Thermo-Calc program and a TCBIN database (Thermo-
Calc Software, Stockholm, Sweden). For microstructure analysis
using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
specimens were prepared following the standard grinding and pol-
ishing procedure and then etched using a mixed solution of 5%
HF, 15% HNO3, and 80% glycerol to reveal grain boundaries. The
chemical composition of each phase in all specimens was mea-
sured using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JXA-8200SX,
JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The grain size of the TiNi matrix, amount
of Ti2Ni phase, and particle size of the Ti2Ni particles were mea-
sured using the line intercept method. The tensile properties and
fracture behavior were analyzed using a Shimadzu tensile test-
ing machine (Autograph AG-IS, SHIMADZU Co., Kyoto, Japan). The
crosshead speed was ﬁxed at 0.3mmmin−1. The fracture surface
was examined using a ﬁeld emission SEM (LEO-1530, LEO Electron
Microscopy Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom).
Since the martensitic transformation behavior of TiNi SMA is
greatly inﬂuenced by impurities [20–22], the amounts of intersti-
tials were measured. The C content was tested using a C/S analyzer
(EMIA-220V, HORIBA Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), and O and N contents
were tested using an O/N analyzer (TC-136, LECO Co., St. Joseph,
MI, USA). The transformation temperature, including start, peak,
and ﬁnish temperature (Ms, Mp, and Mf for martensite; As, Ap, and
Af for austenite), and enthalpy were characterized and quantiﬁed
using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Q10, TA Instru-
ments, New Castle, DE, USA). The heating and cooling rates were
ﬁxed at 10 ◦Cmin−1. The one-way shape memory properties were
evaluatedusingbending tests for 36mm×27mm×1mmﬂat spec-
imens. The detailed testing procedure and calculation for shape
recovery have been presented elsewhere in the literature [23].
3. Results and discussion
TiNi compacts with Ti contents between 50.3 and 53.0 at.% were
sintered at 1280 ◦C for 2h. All specimens were persistent-liquid-
phase sintered in the liquid +TiNi region. Table 2 shows that the
sintered density increased from 71.7 to 100% of theoretical den-
sity when the Ti content increased from 50.3 to 53.0 at.% due
to the increase in the amount of liquid. However, distortion was
observed in the Ti53Ni47 specimen, in which the amount of the liq-

intergranular cracking was noticed. These observations suggest
that the Ti2Ni networks at grain boundaries are the vulnerable
sites during mechanical testing and must be eliminated or mod-
iﬁed if the mechanical properties of Ti51Ni49 compacts are to be
improved. With annealing at 1004 ◦C the shape of the Ti2Ni phase
transformed fromnetwork-like into spherical and thus reduced the
number of sharp radii at Ti2Ni crack tips. Nevertheless, a number of
cracks still initiated at the Ti2Ni phase, as shown in Fig. 9b. When
the applied stress further increased, the cracks penetrated through
the TiNi grain. It was observed that signiﬁcant plastic deforma-
tion occurred ahead of the crack tips, which is an indication of
the impedance of the crack propagation. This plastic deformation,
when high enough, will also induce new cracks. As a result, the
average length of individual cracks decreased and the number of
cracks increased, as compared to those of as-sintered compacts.
3.3. Martensitic transformation behaviors and one-way shape
memory properties
To understand whether the interstitial atoms, in particular C, N,
andO, had reactedwith Ti to formTiC, TiN, and TiO2, thereby reduc-
ing the Ti content in the TiNi matrix and causing adverse effects on
the martensitic transformation behavior, the total amounts of C, N,
andO in the specimensweremeasuredusingC/S andO/Nanalyzers.
Table 4 shows that there was very little pickup of these impurities
during annealing andHIPing. How these elements, except nitrogen,
were distributed in the TiNimatrixwas also examined using EPMA.
The nitrogen content in the TiNi matrix was difﬁcult to determine
due to two reasons. One is the nitrogen content for these specimens
(N<40ppm) was lower than detectable minimum value, 100ppm,
of EPMA. Another one is the overlapping of the Ti Ll peak (395eV)
and N K peak (399eV) in the WDS spectrum [25]. Thus, the nitro-
gen was not measured. Since the amounts of Ti, Ni, C, and O in the

itored and the data reported were averages of 20 measurements.
Table 5 shows that the amounts of titanium, nickel, and oxygen in
the TiNi matrix of these Ti51Ni49 compacts remained almost the
same after annealing or HIPing. Although the amount of carbon
determined using EPMA was not as accurate as that determined
using the C/S analyzer, the data could differentiate the carbon level
in a relative scale. It was observed that the carbon content in the
TiNi matrix of as-sintered compacts was high, about 0.86 at.%. After
annealing or HIPing, the carbon content decreased to 0.66 at.%. The
X-ray mapping also showed that the carbon and oxygen content in
the TiNi matrix was lower than in the Ti4Ni2X (X=C, O) phase, as
shown in Fig. 10. These experimental results conﬁrmed previous
postulations [24,26–29] that the Ti2Ni phase could absorb carbon
and improved thepurity levelwhile keeping ahigh Ti/Ni ratio in the
matrix by preventing the formation of TiC. Moreover, such absorp-
tioneffectdidnot stopafter sintering. It continuedduringannealing
and HIPing.

4. Conclusions
High density powder metal TiNi shape memory alloys with a
high transformation temperature and low impurity content were
fabricated using the press-and-sinter method. With HIPing and
annealing, the density, mechanical properties, and shape mem-
ory characteristics were further improved. The following are the
conclusions:
(1) Powdermetal TiNi shapememory alloyswith a density of 95.3%
were produced by using ﬁne elemental Ti and Ni powders,
51 at.%Ti, andpersistent liquidphase sintering. The transforma-
tion temperature (Ms) of 78.3 ◦C and transformation enthalpy
(H) of 30.7 J/gwerecomparable to thoseofwroughtTiNiprod-
ucts.
(2) Fully dense powder metal TiNi can be obtained through
container-less HIPing without an increase in the amounts of
C, N, and O. With coarse grains and full density, the HIPed
specimen showed improved ductility and shape recovery char-
acteristics. The tensile strength and elongation forHIPed tensile
specimens were 600MPa and 15.4%, respectively. These prop-
erties were lower than those of the wrought products due to
the presence of the Ti2Ni, which is brittle and network-like.
(3) With 1004 ◦C annealing for 24h, the Ti2Ni compound became
spheroidized. As a result, the tensile strengths of sintered-and-
annealed and HIPed-and-annealed tensile specimens were 676
and 662MPa, respectively, about 6% and 10% increments from
that of the as-sintered specimen. The elongations were 20.4%
and 21.6%, or 40% and 39% increments, respectively.
(4) After annealing, an increase in transformation temperature
(Ms) and transformation enthalpy (H) and a narrower trans-
formation hysteresis (Ms–Mf) were observed. This was mainly
due to the decrease in the carbon content of the TiNi matrix.
(5) With HIPing at 1162 ◦C, signiﬁcant grain growth occurred,
and the shape memory characteristics were better than those
obtained by annealing. The H was 33.9 J/g and the Ms was
81.7 ◦C. The shape recovery rate was also improved by about
8%.
(6) The carbon content in the TiNi matrix decreases after HIPing
and annealing because the Ti4Ni2X (X=C, O) phase continued
to absorb carbon during the post-sintering process.

Abstract 
Ti51Ni49 compacts consolidated with persistent liquid phase sintering usually contain Ti2Ni 
networks at the grain boundaries, which cause adverse effects on mechanical properties. With 0.5 
and 1.0 at pct B additions, fine TiB forms during heating and sintering and acts as a nucleation 
site for Ti2Ni to precipitate within the grain during cooling. The resultant uniform distribution of 
TiB and Ti2Ni impedes grain growth and prevents the formation of continuous Ti2Ni precipitates 
at grain boundaries. As a result, significant improvement in tensile elongation, and not 
contraction, as in most as-cast titanium alloys, is obtained due to these changes. The tensile 
strength also increases, without deterioration of the shape memory characteristics. The tensile 
strength and elongation are close to those of wrought TiNi alloys.

treatments because most PM parts are net-shaped and have complex geometries. With changes to 
the morphology of the Ti2Ni phase in PM TiNi alloys, it has been demonstrated that, with hot 
isostatic pressing and recrystallization treatment, an elongation of 21.3 to 33.4 pct can be 
achieved.[6,12,13] The authors recently applied spheroidization treatment on sintered Ti51Ni49 parts 
with 95 pct density. The amount of Ti2Ni at grain boundaries was significantly reduced, and its 
shape was spheroidized. The elongation increased from 14.6 to 20.4 pct, and the tensile strength 
increased from 638 to 676 MPa.[6] Although hot isostatic pressing and post-sintering heat 
treatments can improve the tensile strength and elongation, these operations incur additional costs 
of the PM TiNi. 
Since the tensile properties of as-sintered TiNi are still not comparable to those of wrought 
products, mainly due to the coarse-grained TiNi matrix and large and irregularly-shaped Ti2Ni 
phase, how to inhibit the grain growth during sintering and to reduce the amount and size of Ti2Ni 
and Ti4Ni2O and their distribution have become important research topics. Given that the 
maximum solubility limits of boron in Ti and Ni are 0.050 and 0.049 wt pct at 1813 and 1362 K 
(1540 and 1089 °C), respectively, calculated using the Thermo-Calc program and a TCBIN 
database (Thermo-Calc Software, Stockholm, Sweden), it is very likely that, with boron addition, 
titanium boride may form and act as a grain growth inhibitor via the Zener pinning 
mechanism.[14-17] Furthermore, several previous studies have shown that the addition of boron to 
powder metal and cast titanium and titanium alloys improves the tensile strength by grain 
refinement. However, its effect on elongation is mixed; some alloys improve and some 
deteriorate, depending on the alloy type and the amount of boron added.[14-17] The titanium 
borides formed are also different: TiB2 in cast Ti-Pd-Ni,[14] and TiB in cast Ti, Ti-6Al-4V, and 
Ti-6Al-5Zr-0.5Mo-0.25Si.[15-17] Since the properties of boron-doped PM TiNi have not been 
reported before, the method of adding boron powders, which is a direct and simple method for 
manufacturing, was applied in this study, and the effects of boron on the microstructures, 
mechanical properties, and shape memory characteristics were examined.

fracture behavior were analyzed using a tensile testing machine with a crosshead speed of 3 
mm/min (Autograph AG-IS, SHIMADZU Co., Kyoto, Japan). The fracture surface was examined 
using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO-1530, LEO Electron 
Microscopy Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom). 
Since the martensitic transformation behavior of TiNi SMA is greatly influenced by 
impurities,[18] the amounts of interstitials were measured. The C content was tested using the 
combustion infrared absorption method (EMIA-220V, HORIBA Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), and O and 
N contents were tested using the inert gas fusion infrared method (TC-136, LECO Co., St. Joseph, 
MI, USA). The transformation temperatures, including start, peak, and finish temperatures (Ms, 
Mp, and Mf for martensite; As, Ap, and Af for austenite), and enthalpy were characterized and 
quantified using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Q10, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, 
USA). The heating and cooling rates were fixed at 10 K/min. The one-way shape memory 
properties were evaluated using bending tests for 36 mm×27 mm×1 mm flat specimens. The 
detailed testing procedure and calculation of shape recovery rate have been presented elsewhere 
in the literature.[19] 
 
III.  RESULTS 
The effects of the addition of 0.5 at pct boron and sintering time on sintered density were 
examined first. Figure 1 shows that Ti51Ni49 compacts densified quickly due to persistent liquid 
phase sintering and reached 90.7 pct and 95.3 pct after 10 and 120 minutes of sintering at 1553 K 
(1280 °C), respectively. With 0.5 at pct boron addition, the density further increased and reached 
96.8 pct after 2 hours of sintering. The microstructures of the boron-free and boron-added 
specimens, as shown in Figure 2, reveal that the number of pores decreased but the pore size 
increased as sintering time increased. Also observed was that as the sintered density increased, 
the grain size of both specimens increased due to the decreasing pinning effect of pores on grain 
boundary movement. However, the grain growth in boron-doped specimens was less significant. 
With 0.5 at pct boron addition, the grain size decreased from 172 μm in the boron-free 
 7
boron addition became Ni-rich, and thus no liquid phase was present to enhance densification 
during sintering. 
The distribution of Ti, B, Ni, C, and O in the (Ti51Ni49)99B1 compact sintered at 1553 K 
(1280 °C) for 2 hours were also examined. As can be seen in Figure 6, the Ti2Ni phase trapped 
some oxygen and carbon and thus reduced their contents in the TiNi matrix, which agrees with 
previous results.[7,10,18,21,22] It is interesting to note that the TiB compound formed during sintering 
also contained some oxygen, similar to the gettering effect of Ti2Ni. Thus, a high purity level and 
high Ti/Ni ratio could be attained in the TiNi matrix. 
The tensile properties of sintered compacts in martensite and austenite state were tested, as 
shown in Figure 7(a) and (b), respectively. The sample was in martesitic state when the 
temperature was 298K (25 °C), and was in austenitic state at 413K (140 °C, 20 K above Af). The 
result in every test was acquired from at least six samples. When the sample was in the martensite 
state, the stress-strain curve displayed the stress plateau, which caused from the reorientation of 
martensite variant under applied stress. However, in the austenite state, no stress plateau was 
observed. These results were also consistent with the previous works.[10,13] 
With reduced amounts of oxygen and carbon in the TiNi matrix, no brittle Ti2Ni networks 
at grain boundaries, and fine Ti2Ni and TiB dispersoids uniformly distributed in the fine grained 
matrix, the tensile properties of sintered specimens with 0.5 and 1.0 at pct boron addition were 
much better than those of the boron-free specimens. Figure 7 shows that the specimens without 
boron addition had an ultimate tensile strength of 638 MPa and an elongation of 14.6 pct. With 
boron addition, the tensile strengths increased by about 6 and 14 pct, to 673 and 726 MPa for 
(Ti51Ni49)99.5B0.5 and (Ti51Ni49)99B1, respectively. This level of improvement is similar to that 
observed in as-cast titanium and titanium alloys. The elongation also increased to 17.7 and 21.0 
pct, about 21 and 44 pct increment, respectively. This, however, is opposite to most findings of 
cast titanium alloys, in which boron addition decreased the elongation.[16,17] The reason could be 
that the TiB formed in sintered TiNi compacts was more spherical in shape, while the TiB formed 
during cooling of cast titanium alloys is mostly needle-like, the sharp tips of which become 
 9
effects. 
 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
The previous results demonstrate that boron addition produces compacts with fine-grained 
matrices and high sintered densities. This grain refinement could be attributed to the 
characteristics of the pores and/or dispersoids. In terms of the effects on pores, Figure 1 and 
Figure 3 show that when boron was added, the density increased and the porosity decreased, 
which usually accelerated grain growth. But the grain size decreased. This suggests that the TiB 
and Ti2Ni, rather than pores, were what impeded the grain growth. The influence of the pores and 
dispersoids on grain size can be further compared using the Zener equation:[23,24] 
Dcrit = 4r/3f -----------------------------------------------------------(1) 
where Dcrit is the critical grain size, and f and r are the volume fraction and radius of pores or 
second phases, respectively. Since the mean diameter of the pores in sintered compacts shown in 
Figure 3(b) was larger than that of the TiB and Ti2Ni particles given in Table VI, while the 
volume fraction of pores was slightly smaller than that of dispersoids, it is clear from the Zener 
equation that the fine TiB and Ti2Ni particles determine the final grain size. 
It is interesting to observe that the continuous Ti2Ni networks at grain boundaries 
disappeared when boron was added, as shown in Figure 4. Table VI further shows that the particle 
size of the Ti2Ni particles decreased as the boron content increased. It appears that boron addition 
provided nucleation sites for the precipitation of Ti2Ni when compacts cooled through the 
peritectic (liquid+TiNi→Ti2Ni) temperature of 1257 K (984 °C). As a result, Ti2Ni could not 
precipitate at grain boundaries during peritectic reaction, and consequently, fine particles were 
produced in the matrix and impeded the grain growth. Figure 4 and Figure 6 also reveal that most 
Ti2Ni compounds were tied up with TiB particles. These phenomena suggest that the fine TiB 
particles that formed during heating and sintering acted as nucleation sites for the Ti2Ni to form 
within the grain, preventing the formation of continuous Ti2Ni network at the grain boundaries. 
Moreover, as the amount of boron increased, more TiB nuclei formed and consequently the

Trip Report (附件 1) 
 
Conference: World Powder Metallurgy Congress & Exhibition 
Location: Florence, Italy 
Date: October 10-14, 2010 
 
The World Powder Metallurgy (PM) Congress & Exhibition is held every four years 
and is the largest conference worldwide in the field of powder metallurgy. There were over 
1,000 delegates visiting this conference. In addition, there were more than 100 exhibitors. To 
get familiar with the status in the PM industry and the most recent progress in the research of 
PM, this is the best gathering to attend. About 10 people went to this conference from Taiwan, 
despite the long travelling hours and the high registration fees. 
 
It was noted that China had more papers and more exhibitors in this conference than 
ever before, indicating that the PM and MIM industry are very healthy and is growing 
strongly there. The statistics given by the European PM Association, Japan PM Association, 
and Metal Powder Industrial Federation (USA) all show excellent growth in China, compared 
to most other regions. It was also noted that Korea and Japan had also a strong presentation in 
this conference. The PM and MIM industries in these two countries were also healthy due to 
the recovery of the automotive industry. Regarding the coming PM events, the issues, such as 
organization committee and number of delegates from each country, for the coming Asian PM 
conference (at Jeju, Korea in October 2011) and the next World Congress of PM (at 
Yokohama, Japan in October 2012) were also discussed among the Asian attendees.  
 
Two papers were presented from our PM laboratory at National Taiwan UNiversity. The 
first paper was given by me and the title of the paper was “Mechanical Properties of Powder 
Injection Molded 17-4PH Sintered in Dissociated Ammonia”. The main contribution of this 
study was that a sintering condition has been found and both 316L and 17-4PH PIM parts can 
now be sintered in the same furnace using the same sintering temperature, time, and 
atmosphere. Same mechanical properties and corrosion resistance as those sintered in vacuum 
or hydrogen atmosphere are obtained. This method will reduce the manufacturing cost for 
these materials and enhance their competitiveness.

mostly manual, which is quite surprising and makes me wonder if the accuracy and quality of 
the assembled cars are good enough for a luxury car. 
 
The scheduling of this conference is quite loose. The time control for oral sessions is 
not as accurate as it should be, probably due to the life style of Italians. The hotel 
accommodation is not as good as expected for large cities and the direct travelling to Florence 
is not easy. These are minor issues considering that the conference is successful in general. 
The numbers of the oral and poster presentations and the exhibitors are enormous and 
everyone who attended this conference should have learned a lot.

(MPIF Standard 50) using an injection molding machine (320C/400, Arburg GmbH, Lossburg, 
Germany). To remove the binder, compacts were first immersed in 45 ℃ heptane for 24 
hours to extract the paraffin wax and stearic acid, which are soluble in heptane. After solvent 
debinding, compacts were heated at a rate of 5 ℃/min to 350 ℃ under hydrogen, followed 
by a slower heating rate of 2 ℃/min between 350 ℃ and 550 ℃, within which the remaining 
binder was thermally removed. The final sintering was carried out in a graphite furnace under 
vacuum, or in a tube furnace under hydrogen or DA. Since chromium evaporates under high 
vacuum, the furnace was back-filled with argon and kept at a pressure of 1~5 torr. The 
specimens were heated at a rate of 10 ℃/min to 1320 ℃ or 1350 ℃ and sintered for 2 
hours. To attain optimum mechanical properties, the sintered tensile bars were solutioned at 
1050 ℃ for 30 minutes in argon and then water quenched. For aging treatment (H900), the 
solution treated specimens were heated to 482 ℃ and held at that temperature for 1 hour. 
The sintered density was measured using the Archimedes method, following the MPIF 
Standard 54. The hardness of sintered specimens was measured using a Rockwell Hardness 
tester (ARK-600, Mitutoyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). The tensile strength was measured using a 
Universal Tensile Tester (AG-10TE, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). To check whether the 
organic binder had been completely removed during debinding and sintering, the carbon 
content was determined using a carbon analyzer (EMIA-220V, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). The 
nitrogen and oxygen contents, which are also critical for the γ-austenite amount, were 
measured using an Oxygen/Nitrogen Analyzer (TC-136, LECO, St. Joseph, Michigan, U.S.A). 
For microstructure analysis, the specimens were ground, polished, and then etched with the 
Fry’s solution (HCl:40 cm3, H2O:130 cm3, Ethanol:25 cm3, CuCl2:5 g). The compositions of the 
phases present and the dispersed compounds were determined using an Electron Probe 
Microanalyzer (EPMA, JXA-8600SX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). With actual 
compositions, including carbon and nitrogen, the phase fractions were calculated using the 
Thermo-Calc software and a TCFE3 database (Thermo-Calc Software, Stockholm, Sweden) 
and were compared to those shown in the microstructure. The corrosion resistance was 
examined following the MPIF standard 62. Flat specimens were immersed in a 2% H2SO4 
solution at room temperature for 24 hours. The weight loss was measured and then converted 
into a weight loss per surface area per day factor. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Effects of Nitrogen and Molybdenum on Densification 
The sintered densities of 17-4 PH compacts were about 7.62 g/cm3 when vacuum or 
hydrogen atmosphere were used. In comparison, the density reached only 7.36 g/cm3 when 
DA was used. The most possible reason is that the nitrogen content was high, about 0.148%, 
as shown in Table 1. Since nitrogen is an austenite stabilizer, the presence of nitrogen 
reduced the δ-ferrite amount, in which the diffusion rate of iron is fast. The calculated amount 
of ferrite at the sintering temperature of 1320 ℃ was only 38%, lower than the 61% of that 
sintered in hydrogen with only 0.003% nitrogen. As a result the density decreased. It was also 
noticed that the 0.148% nitrogen was higher than the 0.125%, as calculated using the 
Thermo-Calc software, possibly because the solubility of nitrogen in 17-4 PH is at its 
maximum of about 0.273% at 1178 ℃. Thus, as the temperature decreased from 1320 ℃ 
during cooling, the nitrogen content in the matrix increased slightly. As the temperature further 
decreased, the nitrogen became oversaturated and the extra nitrogen formed Cr2N. 
To reach high sintered density in DA, two approaches were taken. The first method was 
to increase the sintering temperature from 1320 ℃ to 1350 ℃, which increases the δ-ferrite 
amount from 38% to 56%. The other method was to add 1% Mo powder to the 17-4 PH while 
maintaining the sintering temperature at 1320 ℃, by which the δ-ferrite amount increases 
from 38% to 57%. The reason is that Mo is a ferrite-stabilizer and can offset the 
austenite-stabilizing effect of nitrogen. Table 2 shows that both methods achieved the same 
final density of about 7.61 g/cm3.

Mechanical Properties 
Figures 3 and 4 show, respectively, the effects of sintering atmosphere and Mo addition 
on the hardness and tensile strength of 17-4 PH stainless steels. Since the sintered density of 
the specimen sintered in DA was low, the nitrogen strengthening effect was offset and the 
hardness and tensile strength were similar to those of samples sintered in vacuum and 
hydrogen. As 1% Mo was added or as the sintering temperature increased by 30 ℃ to attain 
high density, the hardness and strength of sintered tensile bars were above 30 HRC and 1050 
MPa, respectively. After solutioning and aging, the properties further improved to above 45 
HRC and 1350 MPa. These properties were higher than those of samples sintered in vacuum 
and hydrogen. Figure 5 shows that the elongations of all tensile bars were similar. However, 
after aging, those of samples sintered in hydrogen and DA decreased. The deterioration could 
be caused by hydrogen embrittlement and the problem can be improved by slightly overage 
[13-15]. More detailed study is underway to find the cause and a remedy.

sample sintered in vacuum and hydrogen due to the nitrogen solutioning. With higher 
magnifications, it can be seen that a small amount of fine NbN and Cr2N nitrides were present 
in the matrix, as shown in Figure 7. However, Cr2N, which formed at the surface of as-sintered 
tensile bar, disappeared. This indicates that the solutioning process at 1050 ℃ and the fast 
quenching afterwards eliminated most Cr2N. With these compounds, the corrosion rate of the 
specimen sintered in DA was about 0.02 g/dm2/day, slightly higher than the 0.004 g/dm2/day 
for those sintered in vacuum and hydrogen.

ABSTRACT 
Powder metallurgy technology provides an economical production route for making 
net-shaped TiNi shape memory alloys. Although difficulties have been encountered in making 
TiNi with good shape memory effects, low amounts of C, N, and O, and high sintered densities 
above 90%, these problems can be resolved through the use of fine Ti and Ni elemental 
powders and persistent liquid phase sintering. With a density greater than 95% and a Ti/Ni 
ratio greater than 50/50 in the matrix, the Ti-rich Ti51Ni49 shows high phase transformation 
temperature and enthalpy, and narrow temperature hysteresis, which are similar to those of 
wrought TiNi alloys. The shape memory properties measured with bending tests are slightly 
lower but can be improved by thermomechanical training. The tensile properties performed in 
martensitic state can be further improved by employing hot isostatic pressing and annealing 
on sintered specimens due to the increase in density and spheroidization of the Ti2Ni 
compound. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
TiNi shape memory alloys (SMAs) with excellent functional and structural properties are 
one of the smart materials widely used in the industry [1]. Commercial TiNi products have 
been fabricated mainly by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and vacuum induction melting (VIM). 
However, these processes entail the problems of poor machinability, large amounts of 
machining waste, difficulties in plastic deformation, and high processing costs [2-3]. In 
contrast, powder metallurgy (PM) technology allows the economical production of net-shaped 
products without the need for machining and deformation operations. However, the PM route 
has its own problems, such as contaminations of C, O, and N from the sintering atmosphere, 
or from the lubricant or binder, which are necessary for shaping green parts. The other major 
problem in fabricating PM TiNi is that high sintered densities are difficult to obtain, not to 
mention the good shape memory characteristics. 
The current study aims to resolve these problems through the use of persistent liquid 
phase sintering, fine elemental Ti and Ni powders, and off-equiatomic compositions. The high 
density specimens with isolated pores were further densified using container-less hot isostatic 
pressing. The shape memory properties of these high density PM TiNi alloys were measured 
using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and bending test, and were compared to those 
of the wrought TiNi alloy. The tensile and fracture behaviors were also examined and the 
effect of annealing on improving these tensile properties was discussed. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Specimen Preparation 
Carbonyl nickel powder with a spiky shape and a mean particle size of 3.7 µm was 
selected in this study. Since titanium powders could melt during the early heating process and 
leave huge pores that are too large to fill in later sintering stages, relatively fine gas atomized 
Ti powder with low impurities and a mean particle size of 27.2 µm was used. More details on 
the characteristics of these elemental Ti and Ni powders are given in Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Density and Microstructures 
Previous studies of PM TiNi SMA have shown that a high sintered density is difficult to 
achieve for several reasons: formation of Kirkendall pores, violent Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic reaction, 
and anisotropic shrinkage. In the early stage of this study, TiNi compacts with the Ti content 
between 50.3 and 53.0 at% were sintered at 1280 ℃. All specimens were 
persistent-liquid-phase sintered in the liquid+TiNi region. Table 2 shows that the sintered 
density increased from 71.7 to 100% of theoretical density when the Ti content increased from 
50 to 53 at% Ti due to the increase in the amount of liquid. However, distortion was observed 
in the Ti53Ni47 specimen, in which the amount of liquid phase, as calculated with the 
Thermo-Calc software, was about 60 wt%. Since the Ti51Ni49 compact could be sintered to 
95% density, with which few open pores were present, and without distortion, it was used for 
subsequent experiments and for HIPing to obtain fully dense parts. The annealing heat 
treatment was also performed on both as-sintered and as-HIPed compacts to improve the 
shape and distribution of the Ti2Ni compound, which was about 5.4wt%. 
The microstructures of these specimens with various heat treatments are shown in Figure 
1. The as-sintered specimens display fine grains with Ti2Ni formed at grain boundaries. In 
some regions, the compounds were connected, which would deteriorate the mechanical 
properties. With annealing treatment, the Ti2Ni became more spherical and was no longer 
network-like. When sintered specimens were HIPed, the grain size increased significantly due 
to the long HIPing time at 1162 ℃. As the HIPed specimens were annealed, little further grain 
growth was observed.

6.25%. 
 
The effect of annealing and HIPing on the shape memory characteristics of PM Ti51Ni49 
SMA was also examined using the bending test. Figure 3a shows that the annealing process 
helped very little in improving the shape memory effect. However, with HIPing, the shape 
recovery rate increased by about 8%. After 4 training cycles, the shape recovery rate of all 
specimens with or without HIPing or annealing reached about 98%, as shown in Figure 3b, 
and this recovery rate is comparable to that of wrought TiNi alloys [8]. It was noticed that both 
annealing and HIPing were helpful in improving the shape memory effect measured using 
DSC, but only HIPing is effective when the bending method was used, probably because the 
bending test is a mechanical method and thus more likely to be influenced by the porosity. 
Tensile Test 
The tensile test performed in the martensitic state for the Ti51Ni49 compacts displayed 
typical two stage stress-strain curves, as shown in Figure 4. The tensile strength and 
elongation of the as-sintered tensile bars were 638 MP and 14.6%, respectively. The fracture 
surface of as-sintered compact depicts a mixture of dimple and intergranular structures, as 
shown in Figure 5a. The brittle fracture along grain boundaries was ascribed to the Ti2Ni 
networks at grain boundaries, as shown in Figure 1a. After annealing, the tensile strength 
increased slightly to 676 MPa, while the elongation increased markedly to 20.4% due to the 
coarsening of the grains and the spheroidization of the Ti2Ni compound. The fracture surface, 
as shown in Figure 5b, also shows less intergranular fractures, indicating an improvement in 
ductility. When HIPing was applied to as-sintered specimens, the tensile strength decreased 
to 600 MPa with a slight increase in elongation to 15.4%. For comparison, Mentz et al. [9] 
reported a strength of 790 MPa and elongation of 8.7% for a TiNi alloy fabricated using 
prealloyed powders and HIPing. It was noticed in Figure 5c that intergranular fractures still 
occurred in the fully dense HIPed specimen. With the significant grain growth shown in Figure 
1c and an increase in density, these values for tensile strength and elongation were 
unexpected. Since the Ti2Ni is intrinsically brittle [9], its amount, size, and shape could be the 
determining factors for tensile properties. However, Table 4 shows that all Ti51Ni49 compacts 
had similar amount of Ti2Ni, and the particle sizes of the Ti2Ni were also similar. This leads to 
the hypothesis that the shape of the Ti2Ni phase could play an important role in tensile 
properties and fracture behaviors. When HIPed specimens were annealed, the tensile 
strength and elongation were improved again, similar to the annealing effect on as-sintered 
specimens. The fracture surface also converted from intergranular mode to a ductile mode. 
To explain the effect of annealing on tensile properties, the microstructures were 
examined in higher magnification. It was observed that the Ti2Ni network in the as-sintered 
specimen (Figure 6a) disappeared after annealing (Figure 6b). For HIPed specimens, the few

CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, high density PM TiNi SMA with high transformation temperature and low 
impurity content was fabricated through a press-and-sinter method. Annealing and HIPing 
were also employed to further improve the density and shape memory effect. The following 
are the conclusions. 
(1) The PM TiNi SMAs with a density of 95.3%, transformation temperature (Mp) of 56.3 
℃, and transformation enthalpy (∆H) of 30.7 J/g can be produced by using fine elemental Ti 
and Ni powders and persistent liquid phase sintering. 
(2) The fully dense PM TiNi SMAs can be obtained through HIPing without an increase in 
impurity content. With coarse grains and full density, the HIPed specimen showed some 
improvement in shape recovery and elongation, and the transformation enthalpy (∆H) 
reached 33.9 J/g 
(3) All specimens contained about 5.4 wt% Ti2Ni, which is intrinsically brittle. Thus, the 
characteristics of the Ti2Ni dispersoids are important in determining the tensile properties. 
With annealing, the Ti2Ni compound becomes more spherical and less continuous. As a result,

This study demonstrates that a high density and a high transformation heat can be attained for
PM TiNi. With the use of ﬁne elemental powders, a composition of Ti51Ni49, two-step heating,
and persistent liquid-phase sintering at 1553 K (1280 C), a 95.3 pct sintered density was
attained for compacts with a green density of 66 pct. A transformation heat, DH, of 31.9 J/g
was also achieved, which is much higher than reported previously for sintered TiNi and is
approaching the highest DH reported to date, 35 J/g, for wrought TiNi with low C, O, and N
contents. The main reason for having these properties in powder metal TiNi with higher
amounts of C, O, and N is that the extra Ti, that over the equiatomic portion in the Ti-rich
Ti51Ni49, forms Ti2Ni compound, which traps most of the C, O, and N. This results in low
interstitial contents and a high Ti/Ni ratio of 50.5/49.5 in the TiNi matrix. The tensile strength,
elongation, and shape recovery rate after ﬁve training cycles were 638 MPa, 14.6, and 99.1 pct,
respectively, despite the presence of Ti2Ni compounds at grain boundaries.

I. INTRODUCTION
SHAPE memory alloys (SMAs) can generate large
displacements or forces through thermoelastic martens-
itic transformation or application of a magnetic ﬁeld.[1–4]
Among the SMAs, TiNi is the one most widely used in
industry in particular sensors and actuators, and it is
mostly produced using the cast/wrought processes.
Although powder metallurgy (PM) technology allows
economical production of net-shaped TiNi SMAs and
minimizes the need for machining and deformation
operations, several important problems remain unre-
solved. First, contaminations of C, O, and N from the
powder surface, sintering atmosphere, and lubricant or
binder, which are necessary for shaping green parts, are
high compared to those of cast alloys. Since C, O, and N
can react with Ti and Ti2Ni to form carbides, oxides,
and nitrides,[5–7] Ti is extracted from the TiNi matrix,
causing enrichment of the area surrounding the com-
pounds with Ni at a concentration greater than
50 at. pct.[5,8–10] It has been reported for wrought TiNi
SMAs that when the Ni content is greater than
50 at. pct, an increase of 0.1 at. pct in Ni could result
in a 10 K decrease in martensitic phase start tempera-
ture, Ms,
[11] and the highest Ms and transformation
enthalpy, DH, are obtained with Ni concentrations
ranging from 49 to 50 at. pct.[10,11] Therefore, the
equiatomic TiNi with C, O, and N contaminations will
have a Ni content greater than 50 at. pct in the matrix,
consequently causing a low Ms and low transformation
enthalpy during martensitic transformation.[8,9,12] Thus,
to fabricate PM TiNi SMAs, the contamination intro-
duced from the powder, binder, lubricant, and the
debinding and sintering atmospheres should be mini-
mized and the Ti/Ni ratio should be accommodated for
the C, N, and O retained.
The other major problem in fabricating PM TiNi is
that high sintered densities are diﬃcult to obtain. When
solid-state sintering is used, excessive sintering time is
required to achieve high density due to the slow
diﬀusion rates of Ti and Ni. Moreover, the solid-state
sintering creates large amounts of Kirkendall pores on
the Ni side because of the unbalanced interdiﬀusion rate
between Ni and Ti.[13,14] When liquid-phase sintering is
used, the densiﬁcation rate is usually increased due to
the increase in the diﬀusion rate and the capillarity
eﬀect. However, previous studies of TiNi compacts have
shown that the liquid may penetrate into powder
contact areas, causing swelling.[13] Furthermore, when
coarse Ti powder is used, large pores are left behind at
the original Ti powder sites as the Ti powder melts
above the Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic temperature of 1215 K
(942 C).[13,14] These pores are too large to be eliminated
within a practical sintering time. As a result of these
phenomena, both densiﬁcation and swelling of liquid-
phase-sintered TiNi compacts have been reported.
To resolve the density problem, previous studies have
tried using optimized compacting pressures, isostatic
pressing, slow heating rates, ﬁne Ti and Ni powders, and
ball milling.[13–17] With these previous eﬀorts, the
density and martensitic transformation characteristics
obtained have been improved. However, due to the large
number of variables involved, such as composition,
particle size, powder type, and sintering conditions,
obtaining a high sintered density together with high
martensitic transformation enthalpies and other shape
memory eﬀects remains a challenge.

sintering temperature increased to above 1257 K
(984 C), the density of the Ti52Ni48 specimen increased
with increasing temperature, reaching 95 pct when
sintered at 1553 K (1280 C), while the density of the
Ti50Ni50 specimen increased very slightly. The increase
in density without any interruption suggests that there
was little TiNi-TiNi3 eutectic formation at 1391 K
(1118 C). The results also suggest that, to obtain high
sintered densities, the Ti/Ni ratio and the sintering
temperature should be selected in a way that persistent
liquid-phase sintering in the liquid+TiNi region is
carried out.
Figures 3(a) and (b) show, respectively, the surface
morphologies of the Ti50Ni50 and Ti52Ni48 samples that
were sintered for 10 minutes at 1235 K (962 C), 20 K
above the Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic temperature of 1215 K
(942 C). Most powders were still discernible, and only a
small amount of liquid phase, as marked with arrows,
was noticed. The pore size was close to the mean particle
size of the Ti powder, 27 lm. This indicates that these
pores were the original sites of Ti powders, which melted
during the Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic formation; the selection of
ﬁne Ti powders is thus important for forming small
pores so that they can be easily densiﬁed when sintering
continues.
For high sintering temperatures, the compacts sin-
tered at 1411 K (1138 C) were analyzed because this
temperature is between 1273 K and 1423 K (1000 C
and 1150 C), the range in which most previous sinter-
ing studies were carried out. At 1411 K (1138 C), the
Ti50Ni50 specimen showed a similar density but with
more large pores, while the Ti52Ni48 specimen had a
denser matrix, as shown in Figures 3(c) and (d),
respectively. At all temperatures, the Ti50Ni50 specimen
showed a small amount of liquid phase, even though the
phase diagram indicates that no liquid phase should be
present. This indicates that homogenization of TiNi was
not complete, yet after 10 minutes of sintering, and
transient liquid-phase sintering occurred with a small
amount of Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic liquid formed around Ti
particles. For Ti52Ni48, the amount of liquid was much
higher than that in Ti50Ni50.
Based on this preliminary test, compacts with 50, 51,
52, 53, 54, and 55 at. pct Ti were sintered under high
vacuum at 1411 K (1138 C) for 2 hours. As shown in
Figure 1, all specimens except for Ti50Ni50 were sintered
in the liquid+TiNi region if Ti and Ni were homoge-
nized. Figure 4 displays that the sintered density
increased from 68 to 99 pct of theoretical density when
the Ti content increased from 50 to 55 at. pct Ti.
However, distortion was noticed in the Ti53Ni47,
Ti54Ni46, and Ti55Ni45 specimens, in which the calculated
amounts of liquid phase were too large, at 20, 28, and
36 wt pct (23, 31, and 39 vol pct), respectively. The
sintered densities of nondistorted Ti50Ni50, Ti51Ni49, and
Ti52Ni48 were 68, 71, and 85 pct, respectively. Although
these three compacts had no distortion, their densities
were low and need to be improved with further optimi-
zation of the Ti/Ni ratio and sintering temperature.
B. Microstructure
The microstructures of the preceding samples with 50,
51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 at. pct Ti, as shown in Figure 5,
agreed with the density results shown in Figure 4. A
signiﬁcant drop in porosity was evident when the Ti
content was in excess of 53 at. pct Ti due to the increase
in the amount of liquid phase, which ﬁlled the pores at
the prior Ti particle sites. These ﬁgures demonstrate that
the densities of PM TiNi products with large amounts of
pores that are formed due to the melting of the Ti
particles can be improved by adjusting the Ti content, or
the amount of liquid, and the size of Ti powder.
In addition to the density changes, the phases present
also changed as the Ti content increased. Figure 5(a)
shows that, in the Ti50Ni50 compact, the matrix
consisted mainly of TiNi phase (white area). It was
apparent that as the Ti content increased to 52 at. pct
(Figure 5(c)) and higher, other phases were present. For
example, additional gray and dark gray areas were
observed in the microstructure of the Ti55Ni45 compact
shown in Figure 5(f). The X-ray diﬀraction patterns of
Ti50Ni50, Ti51Ni49, and Ti55Ni45 compacts, as shown in
Figure 6, indicate that the gray and dark gray areas

METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 42A, AUGUST 2011—2433
was also performed, as shown in Figure 7. In the
Ti50Ni50 compact, some TiC and Ti4Ni2X phases with
high contents of C and O were observed. No Ti2Ni
phase was found. In the Ti51Ni49 compact, some
Ti4Ni2X phases were also present. No Ti2Ni or TiC
phase was present. As the Ti content increased to
55 at. pct, a large amount of Ti2Ni phase was present,
with some Ti4Ni2X phases having high C and O content.
With the above data collected from the X-ray
diﬀraction patterns and EPMA, it is suggested that the
white, gray, and dark gray phases shown in Figure 5(f)
are TiNi, Ti2Ni, and Ti4Ni2X (X = O and C), respec-
tively. The EPMA data further suggest that the Ti4Ni2X
is Ti4Ni2O with a small amount of C dissolved in it. The
Ti2Ni also contains signiﬁcant amounts of O, if not
enough to form the Ti4Ni2O compound.
C. Effect of Impurity Content on Martensitic
Transformation Behavior
Figure 8 shows that the contents of C, O, and N in
sintered compacts decreased as the Ti content increased.
A reasonable explanation is that, as the Ti content
increased, more liquid phase formed, and the densiﬁed
structure inhibited the penetration of the residual gas in
the furnace chamber through interconnected pore chan-
nels to react with the Ti inside the specimen. It was also
noticed in Figure 8 that the total amount of C was close
to the 0.046 wt pct in the starting powder. The reason
was that Ti getter powder was used and little further
carburization occurred. Oxygen content was lower than
the 0.175 wt pct in the mixed powder. This is reasonable
because most of the moisture absorbed on powder

(f) Ti55Ni45. All were heated at 5 K/min and sintered at 1411 K (1138 C) for 2 h.
METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 42A, AUGUST 2011—2435
that the C, O, and N in the TiNi matrix were trapped
more completely by the increasing amount of Ti2Ni.
E. Optimized PM TiNi
The results obtained in the ﬁrst phase of this study
indicate that Ti51Ni49 has the highest DH due to a good
balance of the TiNi amount, Ti/Ni ratio in the TiNi
matrix, and low contaminations of C, O, and N.
However, the relative sintered density of this composi-
tion sintered at 1411 K (1138 C) was only 71 pct. Thus,
based on the sintered density data shown in Figure 2, a
high sintering temperature of 1553 K (1280 C) was
chosen to produce optimized PM TiNi.
In terms of heating rate, previous studies by others
indicate that a faster heating rate causes reaction
sintering and thus distortions and large voids. In
comparison, a slow heating rate prevents reaction
sintering but forms a skeleton and inhibits densiﬁcation
during sintering.[14] This study tried heating rates of 2, 5,
10, and 20 K/min, and the results showed that the
highest heating rate that did not cause distortion was
10 K/min, as proposed by Zhang et al.[14] Thus, in the
second phase of this study, this heating rate was used
from 298 K to 1205 K (25 C and 932 C). Above
1205 K (932 C), a slow heating rate of 2 K/min was
used so that homogenization would be more complete
and enhance the densiﬁcation and shape memory eﬀect.
With these selected heating rates, sintering tempera-
tures, and compositions, the resulting sintered density of
the Ti51Ni49 compact was 95.3 pct and the DH was
31.9 J/g. The speciﬁc DH achieved was 34.1 J/g, which is
almost the same as the highest DH, 35.0 J/g, reported to
date for wrought TiNi. The martensitic transformation
temperatures ofMs,Mp, andMf were 347.1 K, 331.0 K,
and 318.5 K (74.1 C, 58.0 C, and 45.5 C), respec-
tively. The amount of Ti2Ni was 6.4 wt pct, as shown in
Figure 13. The tensile strength and elongation were
638 MPa and 14.6 pct, respectively, despite the presence
of brittle Ti2Ni/Ti4Ni2X compound. The shape recovery
rate after ﬁve training cycles was 99.1 pct, indicating
good shape memory properties. The results of these
mechanical and shape memory properties will be
reported separately later.
IV. DISCUSSION
One of the main reasons why PM TiNi is diﬃcult to
produce is the presence of carbon and oxygen in the
Fig. 7—(a) through (c) Backscatter electron images of Ti50Ni50, Ti51Ni49, and Ti55Ni45 and their corresponding (d) through (f) C mapping and
(g) through (i) O mapping analysis.
METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 42A, AUGUST 2011—2437
35.0 J/g reported to date for wrought TiNi. However, it
should be noted that when the Ti content is too high and
when no more C, O, and N can react with Ti or dissolve
in the Ti2Ni phase, the excess Ti2Ni will have adverse
eﬀects by decreasing the total amount of DH and
ductility.
The sintering temperature of 1553 K (1280 C)
chosen for producing Ti51Ni49 may seem too close to
the melting point of TiNi. Fortunately, the solidus
line has a steep slope, as shown in Figure 1, and
the temperature diﬀerence, DT = Tliq – Ts, between the
solidus and liquidus lines is quite large. Thus, the change
in the amount of liquid phase is about ±2 vol pct
if the temperature deviates from 1553 K (1280 C) by
±5 K. As a result, the dimensional control is not a
serious problem, in comparison to other supersolidus
liquid-phase-sintered materials, such as 440C stainless
steels or M2 tool steels, the DT of which is very narrow
and the dimensional control of which is diﬃcult.[22]
In summary, the Ti-rich TiNi is favored for preparing
the PM TiNi. The extra Ti over the equiatomic portion
in the TiNi compact serves three purposes. (1) It
provides a Ti2Ni getter to trap carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen so that the amounts of these contaminants
dissolved in the TiNi matrix are reduced. (2) It main-
tains a high Ti/Ni ratio, above 50/50, in the TiNi matrix.
(3) It forms a suﬃcient quantity of liquid phase to cause
densiﬁcation by persistent liquid-phase sintering mech-
anisms and by ﬁlling pores that have been left behind at
the original Ti powder sites. It should be noted,
however, that too much Ti will lead to the formation
of excessive liquid during sintering, causing problems in

uid phase, as calculated with the Thermo-Calc software, was about
60wt.%. Since the Ti51Ni49 compact could be sintered to 95% den-
sity with few open pores and without distortion, this composition
was selected for HIPing and other subsequent experiments.
3.1. Microstructure, stress–strain curve, and fracture surface
analysis
Fig. 2 shows the microstructures of as-sintered and HIPed
Ti51Ni49 compacts. The as-sintered specimens displayed grains
with an average grain size of 172m and Ti2Ni compounds at
grain boundaries. In some regions, the compounds were semi-
continuous, which would deteriorate the mechanical properties.
After HIPing, nearly fully dense compacts, 99.9% of theoretical den-
sity, were obtained. With a long HIPing time at 1162 ◦C, the grain
size increased signiﬁcantly to 573m,more than 3 times that of as-
sintered compacts, as shown in Table 3. Furthermore, most Ti2Ni
compounds turned into dispersoids, and only a few stripes (Fig. 2d)
were observed at grain boundaries.
The tensile test performed at 25 ◦C in the martensitic state
for the Ti51Ni49 compacts yielded typical two-stage stress–strain
curves, as shown in Fig. 3. The tensile strength and elongation of
the as-sintered tensile bars were 638MPa and 14.6%, respectively.
After HIPing, the tensile strength decreased to 600MPa and the
elongation increased slightly to 15.4% because HIPed specimens
possessed fully dense matrix, larger grains, and few amounts of
semi-continuous Ti2Ni at grain boundaries. For comparison, Mentz
et al. [24] reported a strength of 790MPa and a elongation of 8.7%
for a HIPed TiNi alloy fabricated using prealloyed TiNi powders.
Fig. 4 shows the cross-section microstructure and fracture sur-
face of as-sintered and HIPed compacts. In the as-sintered sample,
the intergranular crack path passed through the Ti2Ni compound
stripes, and the fracture surface consisted of a mixture of dimple
and planar facets, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The fracture surface
under SEM showed that individual grains were still recognizable,
indicating that the cracks occurred mostly along the grain bound-
aries. For comparison, the HIPed sample showed more spherical
Ti2Ni compounds and the fracture path that passed through the
compounds was shorter, as shown in Fig. 4c. Many slip bands
were also observed, indicating that a signiﬁcant amount of plastic
deformation occurred before fracturing. As a result, more dimple
structures and few facets were observed shown in Fig. 4d. These
observations agreed with the improvement in elongation observed
in the tensile test.
The results in Figs. 3 and 4 showed that even with the elimi-
nation of porosity, the tensile strength of the HIPed specimen was
not much improved. Nor was the elongation not much improved,
despite the large amount of grain growth after HIPing. The rea-
son could be that a few Ti2Ni stripes were still present in HIPed
specimens. To further improve the tensile properties, an annealing
treatmentwas applied to change themorphologyof Ti2Ni networks
at grain boundaries. Three annealing temperatures, 932 ◦C, 964 ◦C,
and 1004 ◦C – one below the eutectic point, one above the peri-
tectic point, and one in between – were selected in this study. The
microstructures of sintered and annealed specimens are illustrated
in Fig. 5. As the annealing temperature increased, the change in
grain size of the TiNi matrix was not evident, as shown in Table 3.
Butmost network-like Ti2Ni became isolated, andonly a fewstripes
were still observed in compacts annealed at 932 ◦C. When the
annealing temperature increased to 964 ◦C and 1004 ◦C, little fur-
ther grain growth occurred, and all Ti2Ni networks were broken
and spheroidized. Similar phenomena were also observed in HIPed
specimens after annealing at 964 ◦C and 1004 ◦C, as shown in Fig. 6.
The grain size data in Table 3 show very little grain growth during
annealing. The size and amount of the Ti2Ni precipitates remained
similar to those of as-HIPed specimens because the HIPing tem-

perature of 1162 ◦C was already much higher than the annealing
temperatures.
With the improvedmorphologyof theTi2Ni compound, both the
tensile strength and elongation of as-sintered andHIPed specimens
were improved signiﬁcantly after annealing, as shown in Fig. 7.
The tensile strength of the sintered Ti51Ni49 compacts annealed
at 964 ◦C and 1004 ◦C increased from 638MPa of the as-sintered
tensile specimen to 702 and 676MPa, respectively, and the elon-
gation increased from 14.6% to 19.6 and 20.4%, respectively. Their
fracture surfaces, as shown in Fig. 8a and b, showed an increase in
the amount of dimples and a decrease in the intergranular features,
indicating an improvement in ductility. The effect of annealing on
tensile properties and fracture behaviors of HIP compacts was also
signiﬁcant. With annealing at 964 and 1004 ◦C, the tensile strength
of HIP compact increased from 600MPa to 675 and 662MPa,
respectively, while the elongation increased markedly from 15.4%
to 20.1 and 21.6%, respectively. The fracture surfaces alsowere con-
verted from the intergranular mode to the ductile mode, as shown
in Fig. 8c and d.
3.2. Crack initiation site and propagation
Fig. 9a shows thatwhen tensile stresswas applied to as-sintered
specimens, cracking initiated at the interface between Ti2Ni and
TiNi matrix, which is a stress concentration site. As the tensile
stress increased, cracks preferentially propagated within the brit-
tle Ti2Ni compound and along the Ti2Ni/TiNi interface at grain
boundaries, which was perpendicular to the tensile axis. Thus,

of the as-sintered specimen. The transformation enthalpy,H, also
increased slightly. Since the grain size remained almost the same
after annealing, the main reason could be that the carbon content
in the TiNi matrix was reduced. When the sintered specimen was
HIPed, the Ms increased and the Ms–Mf decreased. The H also
increased. The main reason, in addition to the carbon effect, was
that HIPing was performed at 1162 ◦C and the grain size increased
by more than three times. The similar grain size effect on the
martensitic transformation behaviors was also reported by Kang
et al. [30]. When the HIPed specimen was further annealed, the
grain growth and carbon contentwere not greatly changed because
the annealing temperature was lower than that of the HIPing tem-
perature. Thus, the Ms, Ms–Mf, andH did not further improve.
The effect of annealing and HIPing on the one-way shape mem-
ory propertieswas examined using the bending test. Fig. 12a shows
that the shape recovery rate of Ti51Ni49 compacts decreased as
the amount of bending strain increased. The reason is that the
amount of permanent strain increased as the amount of total strain
increased, which caused a decrease in the recovery strain. Fig. 12a
also shows that the annealing process helped very little in improv-

porosity and larger grains improved the shape recovery rate by
about 8%. After 5 training cycles, the shape recovery rate of all spec-
imens, with orwithout HIPing or annealing, reached amaximumof
99% and became very consistent, as shown in Fig. 12b; this recov-
ery rate is comparable to that of the wrought TiNi alloy [15]. It was
interesting to note that both annealing and HIPing helped improve

I.  INTRODUCION 
Powder metallurgy (PM) technology allows economical production of net-shaped products 
and minimizes the need for machining and plastic deformation operations. Thus, the use of PM 
for fabricating TiNi shape memory alloy (SMA) components has become an important focus of 
research. However, PM TiNi has its own problems. First, high sintered densities are difficult to 
obtain. [1-5] When solid state sintering is used, excessive sintering time is required to achieve high 
density due to the slow diffusion rates of Ti and Ni. Moreover, the unbalanced interdiffusion rate 
between Ni and Ti creates large numbers of Kirkendall pores on the Ni side. When liquid phase 
sintering is used, either by increasing sintering temperature or by increasing the Ti/Ni ratio to 
form liquid phase, some large pores could be left behind at the original Ti powder sites, since the 
Ti powder melts above the Ti-Ti2Ni eutectic temperature of 1215 K (942 °C).[1-5] In addition, the 
increase in the Ti/Ni ratio increases the amount of Ti2Ni and Ti4Ni2X (X=O, C), which have no 
shape memory properties. To resolve these problems, previous studies have used methods such as 
optimized compacting pressures, isostatic pressing, slow heating rates, fine Ti and Ni powders, 
and ball milling.[1-8] With these efforts, the sintered density of press-and-sinter or metal injection 
molded TiNi compacts can now reach a density greater than 95 pct of theoretical density.[6-8] 
An additional drawback in fabricating PM TiNi is that the shape memory characteristics and 
tensile properties are modest compared to those of wrought materials. The reasons are, in addition 
to the porosity, that Ti2Ni and Ti4Ni2O stripes are frequently found at grain boundaries, in 
particular in TiNi alloys with a Ti/Ni ratio greater than 1.[6,7,9] These brittle compounds, which are 
crack initiation sites and crack propagation paths,[8,10] impair mechanical properties. The 
elongation normally found in previous reports for as-sintered compacts is below 15 pct.[6-8,10] For 
wrought Ti-rich TiNi alloys, the amount of this Ti2Ni phase formed during solidification can be 
minimized using homogenization treatment, and its shape can be modified into fine dispersoids 
through repeated thermal-mechanical treatment. With grain refinement and uniformly distributed 
fine Ti2Ni dispersoids, the tensile strength and elongation of wrought TiNi can exceed 800 MPa 
and 20 pct, respectively.[11] However, the PM TiNi does not allow secondary thermal-mechanical 
 4
II.  EXPERIMENTAL 
Fine titanium powders (TILOP-45, OSAKA Titanium Technologies Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 
nickel powders (T-123, Inco Co., Mississauga, Canada), and boron powders (15580, 
Sigma-Aldrich Co., Buchs, Switzerland) with median particle sizes of 27.2, 3.7, and 1.7 µm, 
respectively, were used in this study. The characteristics of the powders are shown in Table I. 
Since the solubility of boron in Ti and Ni is low, the amounts of boron added were 0.5, 1.0, and 
2.0 at pct or 0.10, 0.20, and 0.41 wt pct. The Ti/Ni ratio was fixed at 51/49 based on our previous 
study of the effects of Ti/Ni ratio on sintered densities.[6,7] To prepare the compacts, Ti, Ni, and B 
powders were mixed for 8 hours using a Turbula mixer (T2C, Willy A. Bachofen AG 
Maschinenfabrik, Basel, Switzerland). The resultant admixed powder was compacted uniaxially 
into tensile bars with a gage length of 10 mm and a cross-section of 3.08 mm x 3.12 mm under a 
pressure of 200 to 250 MPa. The green density was 66 pct of the theoretical density. The 
specimens were heated to 1205 K (932 °C) at a heating rate of 10 K/min, followed by heating to 
1553 K (1280 °C) at a heating rate of 2 K/min, and then sintered at that temperature for 2 hours 
under a vacuum of 6.67×10-3 Pa. To reduce the contamination of C, N, and O, neither binder nor 
lubricant was used during compaction, and the compacts were surrounded by Ti powders during 
sintering, which acted as getters for interstitials in the furnace.[6,7] 
To determine the effects of titanium content and Ti/Ni ratio on sintered density, we 
calculated the amount of liquid phase using the Thermo-Calc program. The average data for 
sintered density were acquired from at least 6 samples. For microstructure analysis, specimens 
were prepared following the standard grinding and polishing procedure and etched using a mixed 
solution of 5 pct HF, 15 pct HNO3, and 80 pct glycerol to reveal the grain boundaries. To identify 
the phases and their compositions, sintered specimens were examined using an electron probe 
microanalyzer (EPMA, JXA-8200SX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD, 
TTRAX III, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). The grain size of the TiNi matrix, amount of Ti2Ni and 
TiB phases, and particle size of the Ti2Ni and TiB particles were measured using the line intercept 
method. The data reported are averages of at least 50 measurements. The tensile properties and 
 6
specimen to 130 μm, and the pore size decreased from 98 to 72 μm after sintering for 2 hours, 
as shown in Figure 3. Since high sintered density could be obtained after 2 hours of sintering and 
the oxygen contents of both Ti51Ni49 and (Ti51Ni49)99.5B0.5 compacts remained slightly lower than 
0.2 wt pct of the grade 1 specification of commercially pure titanium, this sintering time was used 
for the following experiment. 
When the Ti51Ni49 specimen was examined with a higher magnification, it was observed that 
continuous Ti2Ni network formed at grain boundaries, as shown in Figure 4(a). With the addition 
of 0.5 at pct boron, this network was interrupted, and two different types of dispersoids were 
dispersed in the matrix, as shown in Figure 4(b). The EPMA results showed that one of the 
second phases was Ti2Ni, while the other second phase contained boron, and the Ti/B ratio was 
1.01. The XRD patterns obtained at room temperature (<Mf), as shown in Figure 5, showed two 
characteristic 2θ peaks at 36.05 and 41.86 degrees. Both EPMA and XRD results indicated that 
TiB formed, not TiB2, and no nickel boride was present. Since the addition of 0.5 at pct boron 
increased the sintered density and improved the microstructure, extension of the boron content to 
1.0 and 2.0 at pct was further examined. 
Table II shows that, after sintering at 1553 K (1280 °C) for 2 hours, the sintered density 
increased slightly from 95.3 pct in the boron-free specimen to 96.8 pct in the specimen with 0.5 at 
pct boron. As the boron content increased to 1.0 at pct, the density slightly decreased to 96.4 pct 
and the dispersoids became finer, as shown in Figure 4(c). When the amount of boron was further 
increased to 2.0 at pct, the density decreased to 81.3 pct. These changes in density could be 
related to the changes of the grain size and the Ti/Ni ratio of the matrix, which determine the 
amount of liquid at the sintering temperature.[6,7] Although nickel might react with boron to form 
nickel borides, all various nickel borides have low formation energy,[20] and were melted at the 
sintering temperature. Moreover, no borides other than TiB were observed in the sintered 
compacts. Thus, it was reasonable to assume that all of the boron reacted with the 2 at pct 
titanium and thus decreased the Ti/Ni ratio and the amount of liquid phase. The calculation with 
Thermo-Calc software, as shown in Table II, indicates that the matrix of the TiNi with 2 at pct

stress-concentration sites and cause brittle fractures.[16,17] As shown in Figure 8, the fracture 
surfaces of the specimen without boron addition contained a mixture of dimples and intergranular 
cleavage structures, and individual grains were still discernable, indicating that the cracks 
occurred mostly along the grain boundaries. For comparison, the fracture surfaces of the 
boron-modified specimen, which had no Ti2Ni networks at grain boundaries, showed more 
dimples and fewer intergranular cleavage structures. The cross-section of the specimen near the 
fracture surface, as shown in Figure 9, further demonstrates that the cracks at Ti2Ni networks in 
boron-free specimens are larger in size but fewer in number. In sample with the boron addition, 
cracks still occurred around Ti2Ni particles, but the cracks were smaller and were less continuous. 
Figure 10 shows the martensitic transformation behaviors of Ti51Ni49 sintered compacts. 
The phase transformation temperatures and heats during cooling and heating were also 
summarized in Table III and Table IV, respectively. The martensitic phase transformation start 
temperature (Ms) and transformation heat (∆H) were similar or close to those of wrought TiNi, in 
agreement with our previous findings.[6,7] It was believed that the gettering effect provided by 
Ti2Ni and TiB and the low total contents of interstitials (C<400 ppm, N<40 ppm, and O<1000 
ppm), as shown in Table V, were the main attributes of these high Ms and ∆H. When boron was 
added, the Ms and ∆H increased slightly. The most likely explanation is that the total volume pct 
of the Ti2Ni and TiB, as given in Table II for calculated values and Table VI for measured values, 
which have no shape memory effect, was slightly lower than in the absence of boron. For shape 
memory characteristics, the effect of boron doping on the one-way shape recovery rates was also 
examined using the bending test developed by Lin et al.[19] Figure 11(a) shows that the shape 
recovery rate of Ti51Ni49 compacts decreased as the amount of bending strain increased, 
indicating that the amount of permanent strain increased as the amount of total strain increased. 
After 5 training cycles, the shape recovery rate of all specimens, with or without boron doping, 
consistently reached a maximum of 99 pct, as shown in Figure 11(b), and this shape recovery rate 
is comparable to that of the wrought TiNi alloy.[9] These results indicate that boron addition could 
improve the mechanical properties of PM TiNi without causing adverse effects to shape memory 
 10
particle size of Ti2Ni decreased, as shown in Table VI. It can be argued that nickel boride may 
also form during heating and serve as nucleation sites too. However, all various types of nickel 
borides were in the liquid form at the sintering temperature. In contrast, TiB has a higher 
formation energy than do all nickel borides,[20] and it remains solid throughout the sintering cycle. 
Thus, it is believed that TiB plays a key role in changing the form of the Ti2Ni compound and 
refining the grain size of the matrix. 
Although boron addition decreased the grain size in the TiNi matrix and improved the 
mechanical properties, the amount of liquid at the sintering temperature of 1553 K (1280 °C) 
decreased because the formation of TiB reduced the Ti/Ni ratio. The calculated liquid content for 
(Ti51Ni49)99.5B0.5 was 11.4 vol pct, which is lower than the 16.7 vol pct of the Ti51Ni49, as shown 
in Table II. This could be the reason why the boron-free specimen had a slightly higher sintered 
density after 10 minutes of sintering, as shown in Figure 1. However, the grain size effect seems 
to be more important than the liquid content in the final stage of sintering. Thus, after 2 hours 
sintering, the (Ti51Ni49)99.5B0.5, which contained only 11.4 vol pct liquid, still had a higher density 
of 96.8 pct than the 95.3 pct of the boron-free specimen. 
 
V.  CONCLUSIONS 
(Ti51Ni49)99.5B0.5 and (Ti51Ni49)99B1 compacts have higher sintered densities and better 
microstructures than boron-free Ti51Ni49. With the addition of boron, TiB forms and acts as 
nucleation site for the precipitation of the Ti2Ni compound within the grain while the compacts 
cool through the peritectic (liquid+TiNi→Ti2Ni) temperature. As a result, brittle Ti2Ni networks 
do not form at grain boundaries, TiNi matrix grains are refined, and Ti2Ni and TiB dispersoids are 
uniformly distributed. The tensile strength of (Ti51Ni49)99B1 is 726 MPa, about 14 pct above that 
of boron-free Ti51Ni49 sintered compacts. Unlike most cast titanium alloys, in which boron 
addition has an adverse effect, these PM alloys have an elongation of 21 pct, 44 pct more than in 
the absence of boron. These tensile properties are comparable to those of wrought TiNi alloys, 
while the shape memory effect is not affected.
