In this report, a navigation system is developed. The 
system includes path tracking and obstacle avoidance 
apparatus for a car-like wheeled robot (CLWR) within an 
internet-based smart-space (IBSS) using fuzzy-neural 
adaptive control (FNAC). Two distributed CCD 
(charge-coupled device) cameras are installed to capture 
both the dynamic pose of the CLWR and the obstacle. 
Based on the control authority of these two CCD cameras, 
a suitable reference command that contains the desired 
steering angle and angular velocity for the FNAC built in 
the client computer is planned. Because of the delay 
encountered by the transmission through the internet 
network (IN) and the wireless local area network (WLAN) 
and the nonlinear coupling features of the CLWR, a 
weighted combination of N linear subsystems that are 
described by state-space model with average-delay is 
implemented to approximate the dynamics of an 
internet-based smart-space CLWR (or IBSS-CLWR). The 
proposed FNAC contains a neural network consisted of 
radial basis function (RBFNN) to learn the uncertainties 
due to the fuzzy-model error (e.g., the random 
time-varying delays and the slippage of the CLWR) and 
the interactions caused by other subsystems. The stability 
of the overall system is then investigated by adopting 
Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a sequence of 
experiments including the control of the off-ground CLWR 
(i.e., the CLWR does not contact with the ground) and the 
navigation of the ISBB-CLWR as compared with the 
conventional PID control are performed to demonstrate the 
advantage of the proposed control system.  
Indexing Terms: Internet-based smart space navigation,

二、簡介 
 Recently, distributed control applications within 
sensor networks are attaining a role of importance (e.g., 
[1-3]). A sensor network that combines both wireless local 
area network (WLAN) and internet network (IN) is called 
as internet-based smart space (IBSS) network. It is able to 
monitor what is occurring within the remote equipments, 
build their own models, communicate with their 
inhabitants, and act on the decisions that they make. If the 
IN and WLAN are absent from IBSS, it is then called 
smart space (SS). Many problems encountered in classic 
wheeled robots (e.g., asking for localization [4], requiring 
high computational power [5], searching for different 
software for different kinds of mobile robot [6, 7], 
minimizing the interference with each sensor [8]) are 
solved when they are in an SS. Due to the constraint of 
system architecture, a CLWR is designed to track a 
trajectory, which is made up by a set of line segments. 
This paper reveals that using a set of line segments is 
practical for the path planning. 
   Based on the concept of IBSS or SS (e.g., [1-3]), two 
distributed CCD cameras are set up in this space to reveal 
the dynamic positions of both the CLWR and the obstacle. 
If the system monitoring region is wide, then we need to 
either increase the number of CCD cameras or consider 
implementing active CCD cameras. After the images are 
processed by a server computer, the poses of the CLWR 
and/or the obstacle together with the outputs of two motors, 
i.e., steering angle and angular velocity, in the CLWR are 
transmitted through to the client computer so that a 
reference input for the FNAC is entered. After the control 
input is transmitting through the system, its results are 
passed through the internet to the server computer. It 
finally reaches the CLWR via a WLAN.

Fig. 3 shows the photograph of our CLWR. Upon 
considering the restriction of selecting a frequency for a 
CCD (or image processing), the total times needed in the 
transmission delay in the IN and WLAN, and the total 
computation times needed for the control algorithm, the 
sampling time is set at 260ms. More details are discussed 
in section 3.2. The maximum estimation error of this 
CLWR problem is about 2cm, which is acceptable and only 
occurs in the periphery of the visible area. Finally, a 
sequence of experiments, including the control of the 
off-ground CLWR and the navigation of the IBSS-CLWR, 
are executed. Comparisons are made between the proposed 
control and the PID control in order to verify the 
effectiveness of the current control system.  
 
四、模糊建模 
 Two models are discussed in the fuzzy modeling. The 
first model does not consider the total times in the 
transmission delay in the IN and WLAN, and the total 
computation time of the control algorithm. The second 
model, to be discussed in section 3.2, incorporates the 
estimated nominal delays for the transmission in the client 
computer.  
4.1 Model Without Delay 
Before modeling the CLWR, a proportional feedback 
gain volt/radk p  45
1
=  for the front-wheel and a forward 
gain 802 =pk  for the rear-wheel are applied to improve 
the system dynamics so as to obtain a unit DC gain of the 
rear-wheel (see Fig. 4). They are called enhanced steering 
and translating subsystems (or ECLWR1 and ECLWR2). 
In this proposed control system, the output of the 
front-wheel is the angular position (in rad ) and the output 
of the rear-wheel is the angular velocity (in srad / ). 
Because the ranges of the operations of the front-wheel 
and rear-wheel are known, and because the symmetric 
feature of the CLWR exists, nine operating points 
as °±°±°== 30 ,15 ,0)()( 11 txty and ,4.20,0)()( 22 == txty  
37± (cm/s) are chosen. Due to the jiggling velocity of the 
rear-wheel caused by the uncertainties, e.g., loading effect, 
slippage of the CLWR, an average statistic dynamics is 
employed to approximate the corresponding dynamics. 
Hence, each connected system and its associated coupling 
systems, i.e., all elements of 22×  transfer function 
matrix, are supposed to be a 2nd order system. Based on the 
resulting step response of a standard 2nd order system, the 
corresponding overshoot ( pM ) and settling time ( sT ) are 
expressed as follows:  
,
21 ξpiξ −−
= eM p )(4 ns wT ξ= (2% criterion)       (3) 
where ξ and
n
ω  denote respectively the damping ratio and 
natural frequency of the transfer function 
( ).2)( 222
nnn
sssG ωξωω ++= Therefore, two equations can 
be formed to associate with these two unknowns ξ and nω . 
The dynamics of the ith operating condition of the CLWR 
is expressed by the following two-input-two-output 
transfer function matrix: 
)()()( sUsGsY iii =                          (4) 
where .)()( and ,)()(),( 2212 ×× ℜ=∈ℜ∈ ssGssUsY iii Define 
)( sG ijk as the transfer function of the jth row and the kth 
column for ),(sG i or the relation between the kth input and 
the jth ouput of the ith subsystem. Because the angular 
velocity of the rear-wheel does not have influence on the 
output of the front-wheel, it has the result 0)(12 =sG i ; i.e., 
the system output 1 (i.e., )(1 ty ) is not affected by the 
system input 2 (i.e., )(2 tu ).  
Remark 1: There are two connected systems for the model 
of the CLWR or IBSS-CLWR. However, in the fuzzy 
modeling of the CLWR or IBSS-CLWR it contains nine 
subsystems. Each subsystem corresponds to one operating 
condition. These modeling representations are different. 
 Subsystem 1 is defined as the system corresponding to 
the operating point or step input, [ ]TsssU 3730)(1 =  
with the unit degree and ,scm respectively. The resulting 
step responses are shown in Figs. 5 (a) and (b). The first 
subsystem is then approximated by the following transfer 
function matrix from these resulting step responses,

 Before discussing the controller design, the following

where )()()(~ tztxtx −= denotes the tracking error

×ℜ∈GG are chosen such that the dynamics of 
0)( =tσ is Hurwitz. In the selection of 21  and GG it can 
also adjust the frequency response between the tracking 
error and the sliding surface. Based on the concept of 
parallel distribution control (PDC), e.g., [11, 12], the 
proposed FNAC is supposed to share the same fuzzy sets 
with the subsystem (15).

nominal system including the learning uncertainties, and a 
switching control (28b), i.e., ),(twi  to cope with the

input may be in a chattering way and its amplitude is also 
large if the upper bound of uncertainties is large. Although 
a large value of iε will make the control input smooth, the 
tracking accuracy is generally degraded. Therefore, a 
compromise must be made. This is one of important design 
consideration that the system uncertainties must be learned 
and to design an extra compensation function so that the 
tracking accuracy and the degree of chattering control 
input are improved. Furthermore, if the uncertainties do not

gain as comparing with its nominal value. It indicates 
that this uncertainty must be smaller than the 
corresponding nominal value. 
(ii) Condition (35) denotes the must known upper bound 
of the uncertainty. Its upper bound is interrelated with 
the system performance. From (36), the larger

5.3 Condition: 2)( σσ nt <  
     When 2)( σσ nt < , the updating law (30) is employed 
to learn the uncertainty ).(ρΩ i  It is assumed that the 
unknown signals )(ρΩ i  can be smoothly truncated 
outside of )()( ρΨρ ∈t (a compact subset in 12ℜ ). Hence, 
their spatial Fourier transformations are absolutely 
integrable. The following universal approximation theory 
(e.g., [20-22]) is first stated.  
Theorem 2: Suppose )()( ρΨρ ∈t  (a compact subset of 
12ℜ ), 2:)( ℜ→Ψρf  is a continuous function vector. For

be continuous and approximated by the following RBFNN:

smaller than that in the robust control. However, a mere 
adaptive control often results in a transient response. In this 
situation, a robust control is first used to force the 
operating point to converge to an acceptable set and then 
an extra compensation of the uncertainties (i.e., adaptive 
control) is used to enhance the system performance.

learn the system uncertainties; then, the environment 
uncertainty is reduced. In addition to the same control

initial poses of the CLWR, (ii) to track the same path as in 
part (i) but with two static obstacles, and (iii) to track the 
same path as in part (i) but with one static and one dynamic 
obstacle in the X -axis direction. The positions of two static 
obstacles with radius 25cm are ),( YX  
)59.482 ,32.72(−= and ,)31.295 ,33.91( cm respectively. 
The path to be tracked is made up by five segments of 
straight line (i.e., the dash lines in Figs. 10 and 11). The 
coordinates of the five-segment from the start point to the 
end point are (-45,0), (-65,330), (-50,495), (85,495), 
(75,200) and (10,0) cm. Then the corresponding responses 
of the above-mentioned three cases are shown in Fig. 10 
for ./6.28 scmd =ν  The responses in the neighborhood of 
the overlap region, which is simultaneously visible by 
CCD1 and CCD2, e.g., ,325275 cmY << are often in an 
unfavorable situation due to the discontinuity resulting 
from the pose estimation and the reduced quality of the 
image system. Because it always exists a minimum turning 
radius for a CLWR, the tracking performance in the third 
segment is inferior. In this situation, an omni-directional 
wheeled robot (e.g., [24]) should be considered instead. 
Although the segments to be tracked are in the periphery of 
smart space with reduced quality in pose estimation, the 
performances in Fig. 10 are still acceptable to confirm the 
usefulness of our control system. In addition, the responses 
of the steering angle and the translation velocity of Fig. 
10(a) by using the FNAC are shown in Fig. 11, which are 
apparently acceptable responses.  
 Before comparing the results obtained by executing 
our proposed FNAC with that obtained by using PID 
control, the parameters of PID control are chosen such that 
the off-ground CLWR has good enough performance. By 
comparing the performance as shown in Figs. 10(a) and (c) 
obtained by CLWR with that performance shown in Fig. 
12 with PID control with the same case it appears that PID 
control is inferior to the CLWR. Although in Fig. 12 it has 
a total delay between 210 and 260ms and we have sound 
result by using PID control, it will fail if the time delay of 
the IBSS-CLWR is changed too much. For instance, a total 
time-varying delay in the range of 260~310ms will 
navigate the CLWR outside of the visible area of CCD1 
and CCD2, and a total time-varying delay in 310~360ms 
will result in a negative phase margin. However, our 
proposed control can survive to accomplish the desired 
goal [23]. These features are verified by our experiments. 
Because the bandwidth of the IBSS-CLWR is constrained 
by the sampling rate, its motion becomes slower as the 
larger sampling time is used. For simplicity, these results 
are omitted. In summary, the robustness of PID control is 
worse than that of our proposed control. If the monitoring 
region is wide, the number of the CCD camera should be 
increased or the active CCD camera should be considered.  
 
七、結論 
 Nine subsystems without delay are developed from the 
step responses of CLWR with nine specific conditions, 
which are also assigned as the premise variables for the 
fuzzy rule. To our best knowledge, we believe that it is the 
first time in the fuzzy modeling that the model has been 
developed from the CLWR step responses with various 
conditions. Meanwhile, the transmission delays of the input 
and output signal passing through the IN and WLAN, the 
image processing time, and the total calculation time in the 
control algorithm, are estimated. Eventually, the fuzzy 
delay modeling of an IBSS-CLWR is achieved. Then, a 
suitable fuzzy reference model is applied to shape the 
response of the closed-loop system. Based on these 
operations, our proposed FNAC is designed without the 
constraint on the upper bound of the time-varying delay for 
the input of an IBSS-CLWR. However, the uncertainties 
caused by the fuzzy-model error and the interactions 
among subsystems must be relatively bounded, and the 
stabilizing conditions of every transformed delay-free 
subsystem must be satisfied. Although the line segments to 
be tracked is in the periphery of the smart space, and 
incurring quality in the pose estimation, our proposed 
control system provides satisfactory performance in the 
path tracking and obstacle avoidance to verify the 
usefulness of our proposed control system. If the delay of 
the controlled system is beyond range, the traditional 
control (e.g., robust control, PID control) often fails due to 
the retarded navigation of the CLWR and the existence of 
negative phase margin. If the monitoring area is wide, the 
number of the CCD camera should be increased or the 
active CCD camera should be considered.
