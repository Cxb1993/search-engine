We propose two rate allocation algorithms for the wavelet based codec and H.264/SVC, 
respectively. The programming languages used in the implementation of the codecs are C/C#. 
Several techniques, such as the distortion estimation for bi-orthogonal filters and the efficient 
representation for the motion vectors, are used to increase the coding efficiency and save the 
computation time. These techniques are developed originally and also published in the 
international journals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
problem in SVC with the user’s preference information. We discuss the implementation and
present the experimental results in Section 6; and then provide some concluding remarks in
Section 7.
2 Aspects of the SVC Bit-allocation Problem
In this section, we discuss three important aspects of the SVC bit-allocation method for a scal-
able video codec, namely, the R-D model, the measurement of the source coder’s performance,
and the structure of data dependency under SVC.
2.1 The rate-distortion model
In our analysis, we use He and Mitra’s ρ-domain source model [7], which relates the number of
zeros to the rate-distortion function of quantized DCT coefficients. Let ρ denote the percentage
of zeros in the quantized DCT coefficients. In the model, the rate R is linearly dependent on ρ
and the distortion D is exponentially dependent on ρ. The relations are shown in the following
equations in which α and θ are parameters and σ is the picture variance:
R(ρ) = θ(1− ρ), (1)
D(ρ) = σ2e−α(1−ρ), (2)
where D represents the mean-square-error (MSE). Substituting Equation (1) into Equation
(2), we obtain the result such that
D(R) = σ2e−Rγ, (3)
and γ = α/θ. He and Mitra’s model assumes that γ is a constant.
2.2 Quality measurement of SVC
To assess the performance of the multi-layer structure, we use the model proposed in [8].
Suppose there are N subscribers, from 1 to N , and the video quality they receive is measured
by the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNRi for subscriber i). We also introduce the parameter
ψi to denote the preference of subscriber i in the system. Then, the overall quality of the N
subscriber system is
∑N
i=1 ψiPSNRi.
A scalable codec supports several spatial and temporal resolutions. Let S and T represent
the sets of spatial and temporal resolutions, respectively; and let [s, t] denote a particular
resolution with s ∈ S and t ∈ T . In addition, let q(i) denote the resolution that subscriber i
requests. Based on the subscribers to the resolution [s, t], we have
QN =
N∑
i=1
ψiPSNRq(i) =
∑
s∈S,t∈T
PSNR[s,t]
∑
q(i)=[s,t]
ψi. (4)
If we normalizeQN by dividing it by the preferences of all subscribers; i.e.,
∑N
i=1 ψi =
∑
s∈S,t∈T
∑
q(i)=[s,t] ψi,
we obtain the average PSNR:
¯PSNR =
∑
s∈S,t∈T
µ[s,t]PSNR[s,t], (5)
where the preference factor of the [s, t] resolution is
µ[s,t] =

q(i)=[s,t] ψi∑N

1. Xti,(s,l) indicates the object X, associated with the frame i of spatial resolution s and at
temporal level l, which is derived after applying temporal prediction on the input frame
Ii,(s,l,∞).
2. Xsi,(s,l) indicates the objectX, associated with the frame i of spatial resolution s and temporal
level l, which is derived after applying temporal and spatial prediction on the input frame
Ii,(s,l,∞).
In a similar way as in Equation (9), the residuals ∆ti,(s,l) and ∆
s
i,(s,l) can be represented as
Ii,(s,l,∞) − Iti,(s,l) and Ii,(s,l,∞) − Isi,(s,l), respectively.
3.2 Temporal prediction
In SVC, temporal scalability with dyadic temporal levels can be implemented effectively by the
hierarchical prediction structure. In temporal prediction, the input frame Ii,(s,l,∞) is predicted
by the corresponding reconstructed frames, Ii−m,(s,l−1) and Ii+m,(s,l−1), with l ≥ 1. Thus, Ir,ti,(s,l)
defined as in Notation is obtained by
∆ti,(s,l) = Ii,(s,l,∞) −
{Pi,i−mIi−m,(s,l−1) + Pi,i+mIi+m,(s,l−1)}
= Ii,(s,l,∞) −
(Pi,i−mIi−m,(s,l−1,∞) + Pi,i+mIi+m,(s,l−1,∞))
+(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(s,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(s,l−1))
= Cti,(s,l) +
(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(s,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(s,l−1)),
(10)
where P is the matrix representation of the motion compensation prediction method, and Cti,(s,l)
is the constant error, defined as in Notation. The second term in Equation (10) represents the
propagation of the residuals ∆i−m,(s,l−1) and ∆i+m,(s,l−1) of the reconstructed predicting frames
in the previous temporal level. The distortion is measured by the variance of the residual
∆r,ti,(s,l). If we assume that the first and second terms in Equation (10) are uncorrelated, then
we have
σ2i,(s,l) = var(C
t
i,(s,l)) +
var(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(s,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(s,l−1)).
(11)
3.3 Spatial prediction
Spatial prediction is achieved by inter-layer spatial residual prediction, which predicts a tempo-
ral residual by up-sampling the corresponding reconstructed temporal residual in the previous
spatial resolution. We use the matrix U to denote an up-sampling method applied to mac-
roblocks in a frame. The residual ∆si,(s,l), defined as in Notation, can be derived with s ≥ 1
as follows:
∆si,(s,l) = ∆
t
i,(s,l) − U(Ii,(s−1,l) − Isi,(s−1,l)), (12)
where the first term is the temporal residual in Equation (10); and the second term is the
up-sampled reconstructed residual of the frame i in (s− 1, l). This equation indicates that it is
4
We introduce the 2 by 1 vector hi,(0,l), whose value is (1 0)
T or (0 1)T to indicate var(Cti,(0,l))
or var(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(0,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(0,l−1)) dominates the variance in Equation (11). Then
Equations (16) and (17) can be combined as follows:
σ2i,(0,l) ≈ hTi,(0,l) (18)(
var(Cti,(0,l))
var(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(0,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(0,l−1))
)
.
By applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we observe that
var(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(0,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(0,l−1)) ≈
((Cα)ti−m,(0,l−1)(C
β)ti+m,(0,l−1)
Di−m,(0,l−1)Di+m,(0,l−1))
1
2 , (19)
where (Cα)ti−m,(0,l−1) and (C
β)ti+m,(0,l−1) are constants.
Case 2: stream (s, l) with s, l ≥ 1.
The frames belonging to this case are predicted by both temporal prediction and spatial
prediction. Similar to Case 1, to determine which term dominates the other two components
in the variance in Equation (15), we introduce a 3 by 1 vector hi,(s,t) with the value of each
component either 0 or 1. We set hi,(s,t) = (1 0 0)
T if var(Csi,(s,l)) is the dominating term; we set
hi,(s,t) = (0 1 0)
T if var(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(s,l−1)+Pi,i+m∆i+m,(s,l−1)) is the dominated term; and, we set
hi,(s,t) = (0 0 1)
T to indicate var(U(∆i,(s−1,l)) is the dominating term. To simplify our analysis,
we also assume that the variance of the predicted frame in the case can be approximated as
follows:
σ2i,(s,l) ≈ hTi,(s,l) var(C
s
i,(s,l))
var(Pi,i−m∆i−m,(s,l−1) + Pi,i+m∆i+m,(s,l−1))
var(U(∆i,(s−1,l)))
 .
(20)
We suppose that var(U(∆i,(s−1,l))) can be approximated as
σ2i,(s,l) = (C
ω)si,(s−1,l)Di,(s−1,l), (21)
where (Cω)si,(s−1,l) depends on the up-sampling method; if bilinear interpolation is used, then
(Cω)si,(s−1,l) ≈ 1.
4 Distortion of a Layer
We use nu(l) to denote the number of frames in temporal level identifier l. The dyadic temporal
structure means that
nu(0) = n0, and nu(l) = 2nu(l − 1) for l ≥ 1, (22)
where n0 is the number of frames in the stream (0, 0). For convenience, we define that nu(−1) =
0. The number of frames in temporal level l is 2l−1n0. A user who subscribes to temporal
resolution t will receive all the frames in the temporal level identifiers 0, 1, · · ·, t. Thus, the
user will receive
∑t
i=0 nu(i) = 2
tn0 frames. The average distortion of the frames in the resolution

5 Solving the Inter-layer Bit Allocation Problem
Our objective is to derive the optimal QP assignment that will minimize the average distortion
function in Equation (8). To achieve the objective, we need to represent the average distortion
as a function of the bits assigned to an individual stream. After substituting Equation (23)
into Equation (8), and taking the minus logarithm, we have
log{∏

log(
nu(l)∏

Substituting Equation (28) into Equation (29), the minus logarithm of the average distortion
is calculated as

log(

i=nu(l−1)+1
Di,(s,l)) = f1 + f2, (30)
in which f1 and f2 denote the first and second terms in Equation (30) and can be deduced as
follows.
1. The first term:

l=0
ω(s,l)b(s,l), (33)
where ωi,(s,l) denotes the weight of bi,(s,l) and can be calculated by reordering the summations
in Equation (32). The value of ω(s,l) is the weight of the rate allocated to the stream (s, l) and
can be computed by
ω(s,l) =
∑nu(l)
i=nu(l−1)+1 ωi,(s,l)γi,(s,l)bi,(s,l)
b(s,l)
. (34)
From the above derivations, we have shown that maximizing average PSNR of H.264/SVC
with spatial and temporal scalability can be approximated by maximizing Equation (33). If we
use C to denote the maximal rate allowed for encoding the GOP, the constraint of the optimal
bit allocation problem is ∑
s∈S
|T |−1∑
l=0
b(s,l) ≤ C. (35)

the average PSNR gain of Proposed over Lagrangian is also dependent on the user preference
profile, the coding gain in Figure 2 is much larger than that in Figure 1.
7 Conclusion
We present a theoretical analysis of joint R-D optimization for multiple-layer coding. The
data dependency structure of temporal and spatial prediction is fully explored in the analysis.
We derive that the average PSNR of SVC is the weighted average of the bit rates assigned
to individual streams. The weighting factor is a function of all the affected layers and their
corresponding preference factors. We propose an optimal bit allocation algorithm that controls
the encoder rate with subscribers’ preference information. Our experiment results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm yields a better performance compared to that of a state-of-the-art
coder when the preference information is provided to both coders. In a future work, we will ex-
tend our analysis to study the rate allocation of the coder that considers spatial, temporal and
quality scalability simultaneously. In addition, we will explore and analyze the rate allocation
strategy while users’ preferences are changing during the encoding process or not known to the
encoder.

ICIP, the leading Image processing conference, was held in Hong Kong this year. We 
took our plane on September 26 and went to the conference building right after our 
arrivals. The general chair is Wan-Chi Siu, who is the chair professor of Hong Kong 
Polytechnic University. He organized this ICIP into several sessions. 
 
The tutorials were delicately organized into different topics. We joined the T-7: To tell 
a Good Picture from a Good one: Perceptual Visual Quality Evaluation. In this talk, we 
exchange some perspectives with the experts came from different nations. 
 
The first day of ICIP was very exciting. After the opening, the plenary talk began right 
away. Prof. Tony F Chan deduced his recent work to relax the convex so as to reach 
the global optimal. Since the cost function had been relaxed to a new convex one, 
the fast algorithm can be realized. In the afternoon, mainly I went to the MP.PB 
session to gain the knowledge of debluuring and denoising. 
 
The second day, the plenary talk was presented by Thrasyvoulos N Pappas. Prof 
Pappas introduced the visual signal analysis and compression. He discussed the 
development of objective texture similarity metrics that allow substantial 
point-by-point deviations between textures that according to human judgment are 
virtually identical. After the plenary talk, I went to TP.PI session to obtain new ideas 
of high dynamic range (HDR). The banquet was held on this day.
