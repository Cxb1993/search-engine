2industry utilize VDTs during their
normal workday, and high rates of upper
extremity (UE) musculoskeletal
symptoms and visual fatigue have been
reported among some
telecommunication employee group
(Ferguson, 1976; Gunnarsson &
Sőderberg, 1983; Hocking, 1987; Hales
et al., 1994; Ferreira et al., 1997;
Ferreira et al., 2002). Hales et al. (1994)
indicated that work-related upper
extremity musculoskeletal disorders
were relatively common among
telecommunication employees. Hocking
(1987) reported the prevalence rate of
repetition strain injury (RSI) in female
and male were 27% and 20%,
respectively, in Australia
telecommunication employees.
More recently, attention has been
progressively moving to aspects of work
organization, worker performance and
psychosocial environment related to
health complaints in telecommunication
employees (DiTecco et al., 1992; Lund,
1992; Smith et al., 1992; Westin, 1992;
Smith & Bayehi, 2003; Chi & Lin,
2004). DiTecco et al. (1992) identified
major sources of work-related stress
among telephone workers by a
questionnaire survey. They discovered
that call-time pressures items were most
strongly related to job stress by workers,
and over 50% of workers reported that
telephone monitoring led to their job
stress. Smith et al. (1992) also reported
that electronic performance monitoring
could influence worker stress responses
in telecommunications companies.
Some studies have shown that high
levels of workplace stress which results
in a variety of adverse health conditions,
such as cardiovascular disease,
hypertension and digestive aliments
from manufacturing industries to service
industries (Kristensen, 1989; Homer et
al., 1990; Schnall et al, 1994; Hellerstedt
& Jeffery, 1997). Major sources of job
stress identified in the literature included
heavy job demands and long working
hours, lack of control, routing tasks,
inter-personal conflicts, and
organizational problems (Hurrell et al,
1998).
As job stress is a widespread
problem in most call center operators,
there are few reports to examine the
association of job stress with
self-perceived health complaints, such as
musculoskeletal disorders and visual
problems. Yet, there has been no
research, to our knowledge,
investigating how the call center
operators face multiple health risks
related to job stress in the workplace.
Therefore, the present study employed a
cross-sectional questionnaire survey on
individual factors, health status,
perceived job stress levels, major job
stressors and psychosocial job
characteristics to investigate the rates of
subjective physical discomforts, and
assess the prevalence of job stress and
the patterns of major job stressors
among call center operators of two large
telecommunication companies in Taiwan.

Psychosocial job characteristics
was assessed by using a Chinese version
22 item Job Content Questionnaire
(C-JCQ), which was revised from the
Karasek et al.’s (1998) Job Content
Questionnaire (JCQ). Of these analyses,
we used the job control dimension by
summing up two subscales: skill
discretion of six items, and decision
authority of three items. Job demands
scale is measured by five items. The
work-related social support scale is the
sum of two subscales: support from
supervisors and support from
co-workers, both measured by four
items. For each item, the response was
recorded on a four-point Likert scale,
range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4
(strongly agree). The C-JCQ was
developed for domestic workers in
Taiwan and has been tested and
validated (Cheng et al. 2003).
Among FE company operators,
760 usable returns were received, while
263 useable returns were received from
CH company operators, resulting in
response rates of 95% and 88%,
respectively.
2.3 Statistical Analyses
Comparison of operators’
demographic parameters such as gender,
age, length of employment (year),
marital status, full time work, and
prevalence of body discomfort were
performed between FE and CH
companies by means of Student’s t test
or Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. The
prevalence of job stress and the patterns
of major job stressors were examined by
demographic and employment factors.
To measure the associations,
multivariate logistic regression
techniques were used to determine the
relationship of perceived levels of job
stress with various health complaints.
The questionnaire data provided by
respondents were analyzed using the
SPSS for Windows package with the
significance level of 0.05.
3. Results
3.1 Characteristics of the study
population
Characteristics of the study
population were summarized in Table 1.
The average age of FE and CH
companies were 28.0 and 33.9 years,
respectively, and the mean (SD) length
of employment was 2.7 (2.1) and 9.1
(10.2) years for FE and CH companies.
Most of the call center operators were
female (83% vs. 90%), single (80% vs.
53%) and full-time workers (99% vs.
88%). As for the age, length of
employment, gender, marital status
6(Table 5). However, significant
differences between FE and CH
companies were found in most of the
C-JCQ sub-scales. High job control,
high work demands and high workplace
supports were reported by FE company
operators.
3.5 Health problems in association
with job stress
The associations of perceived
levels of job stress with various health
complaints were examined. As shown in
Table 6, the associations between
perceived levels of job stress and health
complaints are presented for all the
study subjects by gender. Gender and
length of employment were found to
confound the relationships of job stress
and health outcomes (Table 3). To adjust
for potential confounding effects of
gender and length of employment, a
multivariate logistic regression was
performed. As shown in Table 6,
compared with low-stress operators,
operators with higher levels of job stress
had significantly increased risks of
various health complaints. Gender and
length of employment-adjusted odds
ratios (95%CI) for discomfort
complaints among the study subjects
were shown as following: 1.52 for skin
(0.91-2.55), 2.33 for eyes (1.44-3.75),
2.05 for ears (1.31-3.21), 3.25 for throat
(1.93-5.49), 2.01 for respiratory organs
(1.28-3.16), 4.97 for cardiovascular
system (2.75-8.98), 4.45 for digestive
organs (2.68-7.36), 2.99 for renal organs
(1.66-5.36), and 2.74 for
musculoskeletal system (1.68-4.46).
When analyses were performed by
gender, it became clear that the strength
of the associations of job stress with
health risks was more pronounced
among female operators, while no
association for levels of perceived job
stress and health complaints was found
among male operators.
4. Discussion
4.1 Prevalence of physical discomforts
The overall prevalence of
musculoskeletal discomforts (73% for
FE and 81% for CH) and visual fatigue
(70% for FE and 84% for CH) were
significantly higher after prolonged
working at call centers, as shown in
Table 1. These findings were similar to
the prevalence among disabled workers
in the call center (Chi & Lin, 2004).
This study also found a high prevalence
of throat aliment (78% for FE and 78%
for CH) for the call center operators.
However, this was not evident from the
previous survey.
Musculoskeletal discomforts and
visual fatigue were the most pronounced
and prevalent complaints for the VDT
task and could get worse after a long
period of work, inadequate workstation,
low luminance contrast, close viewing
distance, and fast moving targets
(Duncan & Fergusson, 1974; Hunting et
al., 1981; Knave et al., 1985; Sauter et
al., 1991; Chi & Lin, 1998). Thus,
appropriate ergonomic improvements
8on ear discomfortness of operators. An
evaluation on the operators’preferred
and no-harm volume settings is
necessary.
4.2 Prevalence and risks factors of job
stress
Nearly one-thirds of the operators
(34% for FE and 32% for CH) were
classified as high-stress workers. This
was lower than that of DiTecco et al.’s
study (57%). However, 24% of male and
35% of female reported that they often
or always felt very stressed at work.
These were significantly higher than
those, i.e., 7.6% for male and 6.5% for
female, observed in the national working
population survey in Taiwan (Cheng et
al., 2001). The association between
perceived job stress and body
discomforts in the present study
demonstrated that the work at the call
center is characterized with perceived
job stress, which may in turn result in
high reports of body discomforts.
Several studies have documented job
stress as an important risk factor for
health-related quality of life (Lerner et
al., 1994; Amick et al, 1998).
Furthermore, in compliance with
previous reports, the associations of job
stress with health risks appeared to be
much stronger among female operators.
The call center operators of
company CH had higher discomfort
prevalence rates for eyes,
musculoskeletal system, cardiovascular
system, and digestive organs than those
of company FE as shown in Table 2.
Though, the percentages of high-stress
operators between FE and CH
companies were not significant different
(Table 3), other individual factors, such
as age, length of employment, and
psychosocial conditions were
significantly different (see Table 1 &
Table 5). Results shown in Table 1
revealed that CH company’s operators
were older (33.9 years old vs. 28.0 years
old) and with much more working
experience at call center (9.1 years vs.
2.7 years) than the FE company
operators. Nevertheless, Company CH’s
operator scored substantially less in job
control (skill discretion, decision
authority) and supervision support.
Difference in the ranks of top five
job stress was found between the two
call centers in the present study (Table
4). Interestingly, a great majority of the
study subjects, 70.1% for FE and 63.0%
for CH, considered “Having to deal with 
dificult customers” as the top one job
stressor. This finding was different from
that of the DiTecco et al.’s study (1992),
which reported that the most important
job stressor was “Difficulty in serving
customer well and still keeping average
work time down.”We examined all the
major job stressors between DiTecco et
al.’s and our studies and found that
operators of both studies reported
similar specific stressors which
contributed to their feelings of job stress,
for instance, “Difficulty in serving
customers well and still keeping average
