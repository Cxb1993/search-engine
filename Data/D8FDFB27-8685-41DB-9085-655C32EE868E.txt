（二） 計畫英文摘要 
The research project presents a study of solving the joint replenishment problem (JRP) 
by using the RAND method, a heuristic approach that has been proven to find almost as good 
as the optimal solutions, under uncertain demand and holding costs. The classical JRP deals 
with the problem of determining a replenishment policy that minimizes the total cost of 
replenishing multiple products from a single supplier. The total cost considered in the JRP 
consists of a major ordering cost which is independent to the number of items in the order, a 
minor ordering cost depending on the items in the order, and the holding cost. There have 
been many heuristic approaches proposed for solving the JRP. Most of the research work was 
done under the assumption where the unit holding cost and demand are known and constant. 
However, in real world the holding cost as well as the demand for each item type may be 
difficult to be precisely estimated or it maybe changing over the replenishment horizon. The 
study addresses the issue of the uncertain demand and holding cost to the JRP and 
investigates how misestimate of holding cost may influence the replenishment policy 
determined by the most famous JRP heuristic, the RAND method.

3-1. The RAND Method under Uncertain Unit Holding Cost 
For the classic JRPs, the procedure of the RAND method is as follows: 
Step 1. Compute the maximum value (Tmax) and minimum value (Tmin) for T using the following 
equations.

the true future demands by the managers who use these assumed true demands as input for their 
replenishment plans. In this study, we examine the impact of the misestimate on unit holding 
costs and the forecasting errors on the demands for the ordered items when adopting the RAND 
method to solve the JRPs. The misestimates may depend on how many items are estimated 
inaccurately in terms of their unit holding costs, what these items are, and how much the 
estimating error is. In order to measure the impact of the misestimates of the unit holding costs 
and the demands when determining the replenishment plans using the RAND method, we use the 
following notation.  
 
PH: Proportion of the number of the items whose unit holding costs are estimated 
inaccurately. 
PD: Proportion of the number of the items whose demand rates are estimated inaccurately. 
Δhi: Fraction of the actual annual unit holding cost representing the difference between the 
actual unit holding cost and the estimated holding cost for item i. 
Δdi: Fraction of the actual demand rate representing the difference between the actual 
demand rate and its forecasting value for item i . 
TR: Basic cycle time found using the RAND method with the values of actual unit holding 
costs (or actual demands). 
TE: Basic cycle time found according to the RAND method using the estimates of the unit 
holding costs (or the demand forecast). 
kiR: An integer multiple of a basic cycle TR  for item i. 
kiE : An integer multiple of a basic cycle TE  for item i. 
TCR: Total cost based on the TR and kiR  (i = 1,2,…..,n). 
TCE: Total cost based on the TE and kiE  (i = 1,2,…..,n). 
 
For example, if given a joint replenishment problem with all the parameters known, Di, mi, M, 
and the actual holding cost hi, the basic cycle time TR and all the values of kiR can be determined 
by using the RAND method, and the total cost  TCR can be determined by equation (1). To 
examine the impact of the estimating errors on holding costs, we deal with the same problem 
under the same parameters except we use the estimates of unit holding cost (hi．(1 + Δhi)). Again, 
the estimated basic cycle time TE and all the values of kiE can be determined by using the RAND 
method and will be used to find the total cost TCE. Note that the estimated holding cost (hi．(1 + 
Δhi)) are only used to determine TE and kiE. The total cost belonging to this policy (TCE) is 
determined using the real holding costs (hi), since, in real life, the policy is applied under the real 
holding costs. 
 
3-2. Simulation and Experimental Results 
In this paper, we conduct a simulation study to measure the impact of misestimates of the unit 
total cost for the cases of PD = 70%, while if the forecasting error, Δdi, is reaching -50%, the total 
cost will increase by about 15%.

Figure 2. Impact of forecasting error of demands on total cost (50 items) 
 
In addition to separately measuring the effects of misestimates on the unit holding costs and 
customer demands, it is essential to consider both estimating errors simultaneously for 
developing a joint replenishment policy. Figures 5 and 6 show the impact of different levels of 
PH on the total cost for the case where PD is equal to 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. (Note that the 
fraction, Δdi and Δhi, are both set equal for the values at x-axis in Figure 5, 6, and 7.) If the unit 
holding costs are precisely estimated (PH = 0), then the value of TCerror at Δhi = Δdi = -0.5 
increases from 2.48% to 14.71% when the value of PD is from 0.3 to 0.7. If the unit holding costs 
are estimated very roughly (say PH = 0.7), then the value of TCerror at Δhi = -0.5hi and Δdi = 
-0.5di increases from 22.86% to 55.03% when the value of PD is from 0.3 to 0.7.  
 
Since the JRP is concerned with ordering multiple items from a single supplier, the number of 
ordered item types may sometimes depend on how many different item types the supplier can 
offer. In this study, we are also interested if the number of ordered items affects the total cost 
results from the replenishment policy developed by the RAND method under different levels of 
misestimates. In Figure 7, three cases (number of items = 10, 30, and 50) are examined under PD 
= 0.7 and PH = 0.7.  It is evident that the three curves representing these three cases do not 
present much difference under the circumstance when the unit holding costs and demands of 70% 
of the ordered items are not accurately estimated. Various scenarios of combining different values 
of PD and PH have been examined and similar results can be found. That is, overestimating the 
unit holding costs is less risky than the underestimating the unit holding costs even under the 
replenished. Management Science, 21(4), 436-443.
