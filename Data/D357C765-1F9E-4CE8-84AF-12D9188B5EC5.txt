micro devices differ from those in macroscopic devices.  
The experimental investigations related to the pressure drop in microchannels are 
introduced first. Wu and Little [1, 2] conducted tests on rectangular microchannels 
with hydraulic diameters ranged from 50 to 80 mµ . Their results indicated an earlier 
transition from laminar to turbulent flow region. Their measured  value for 
laminar flows was constant but was much higher than 64. The measured friction 
factor for turbulent flows was also much higher when compared with the 
conventional results.

Choi et al. [3, 4] measured friction factor for both laminar and turbulent flows in 
microtubes. The internal diameters of these microtubes ranged from 3 to 81 mµ  and 
the working fluid was nitrogen gas. They found that the measured  values were 
about 53 for laminar flows, instead of 64 as predicted by the incompressible flow 
theory. The measured friction factor for turbulent flows was also smaller than that 
predicted using conventional correlations for larger tubes. Yu [5] investigated the 
fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics of nitrogen gas and water in microtubes 
with diameters of 19, 52 and 102 
Re⋅f
mµ . They reported that the measured friction 
factors were about the same as that predicted by the Blasius correlation.  
Chen et al. [6] solved the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate two-dimensionally 
gaseous flow in microchannels. They confirmed that for very small Reynolds 
numbers, on the order of , the fluid in a microchannel is indeed isothermal due 
to the extraordinarily large momentum and heat diffusion in the smallest dimension 
direction. But if the Reynolds number is large, the isothermal flow assumption is no 
longer valid. Chen et al. [7] solved the compressible boundary-layer equations to 
simulate compressible flow in microtubes. The numerical results compared well with 
the experimental data. They reported that slip and compressibility effects are the two 
major factors that cause difference in flow behavior in conventional and micro tubes

Sobhan and Garimella [8] conducted a comparative study of the experimental 
results and theoretical investigations available in the literature on fluid flow and heat 
transfer in microchannels. They reported that there is little agreement between the 
experimental results reported by different investigators. Also, the information in the 
literature does not point to unequivocal trends of variation or reasons of such trends. 
They concluded that a reliable prediction of heat transfer and pressure drop in 
microchannels is not possible and additional studies are necessary. 
The major advantage of the present numerical procedure is its fast speed due to 
the parabolic character of the governing equations. An efficient space marching 
algorithm is adopted to solve the governing equations. It is at least two to three orders 
of magnitude faster than the full Navier-Stokes simulation. This is because the 
unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are a mixed set of hyperbolic-parabolic equations 
that are integrated in time until a steady state solution is reached. This procedure is 
inefficient because of its time marching procedure. The present numerical procedure

The constants for the above two equations are listed in Table 1. In the reduced 
Navier-Stokes equations described above we neglect the diffusion terms in the 
x~ -direction. This is reasonable, because the momentum and energy diffusions in the 
-direction are much smaller than that in the x~ y~ - and z~ -directions for the long 
microchannel flows studied in this paper. The pressure mp~  in the -momentum 
equation is different from the pressure

The pressures mp~  and cp~  are calculated separately. The pressure mp~  is a 
space-averaged pressure over a y~ - z~  cross-section. The gradient xd~
pd m~  is 
calculated iteratively in a y~ - z~  cross-section by satisfying the global mass 
conservation. The pressure cp~  is a correction to the pressure mp~ . It only influences 
the - and -velocities; it does not affect the -velocity. The three momentum 
equations and the continuity equation are combined to construct a Poisson equation to

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
In order to validate the numerical program, the program was first used to 
calculate the friction factor for the flow in conventional-size channels. The channel 
height was fixed at 1cm. The channel width was varied to obtain different aspect 
ratios. The channel length was 1000 times the hydraulic diameter. The working fluid 
was water. The channel outlet pressure was atmospheric pressure and the pressure 
ratio, , was 1.001. Several different aspect ratios 
were simulated. The simulated conditions are listed in Table 1. The calculated  
values are listed in Table 2. The parameter Re in Table 2 was defined by 
. Also listed in Table 2 for comparison are the results of two 
dimensional numerical simulations conducted by Shaw and London [11]. In Shaw 
and London’s report

 is a function of aspect ratio, 
, and is independent of Reynolds number. As 
demonstrated in Table 2, the agreement between the present numerical solution and 
Shaw and London’s results is excellent. The difference is less than 0.2%. This close 
agreement validated our numerical program.

Water is the most often used liquid in cooling equipment. Yet, its physical 
properties change remarkably with changing temperature. For example, its 
conductivity increases from about 0.56 )/( Kmw ⋅  at 273K to about 0.68  at 
373K, a 21% increase. Its absolute viscosity decreases from about  
at 273K to about  at 373K, an 84% decrease. These property 
changes affect the friction and heat transfer characteristics of microchannel flows 
significantly. To investigate these effects we simulated microchannel flows subject to 
changing fluid properties. The simulated conditions are listed in Table 3.

A three-dimensional numerical procedure was developed to study the friction 
characteristics for steady laminar incompressible flow in long microchannels. The 
numerical program was first used to simulate incompressible flow in 
conventional-size channels subject to isothermal wall boundary conditions. The 
calculated  at several different aspect ratios compared quite well with that of 
the corresponding two-dimensional incompressible fully developed flows calculated 
by other investigators. This comparison validated our numerical program. 
Re⋅f
For the isothermal wall condition, the pressure and Re⋅f  distributions along 
the channel axis are nonlinear due to the fluid property changes. The  value 
reaches a constant for different pressure ratios. This constant equals to that obtained 
from two-dimensional simulation for constant property fluid. But this constant should 
not be used for microchannel flows because a large part of the channel deviates from 
this value. 
Re⋅f
For the constant heat flux condition, the pressure and Re⋅f  distributions along 
the channel axis are also quite nonlinear due to the fluid property changes. Unlike the 
isothermal wall case, the  value is different for different heat fluxes. The fluid 
property changes must be taken into account in analyzing microchannel flows if large 
temperature variations are involved.
