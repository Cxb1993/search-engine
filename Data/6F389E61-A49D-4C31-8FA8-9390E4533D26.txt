displays (FDP) [6-7]. For OTFT applications, 
the pentacene (C22H14) and CuPc are the 
most potential organic materials for high 
mobility, which equal to or even larger than 
the mobility values found in amorphous Si [8]. 
In the past, most researchers developed high 
performances pentacene- and CuPc-based 
OTFT through complicated fabrication 
process or addition of some rare materials 
[9-12]. On the other hand, it has been 
evidenced that the incorporation of iodine (I2) 
on polymer material could increase the 
conductivity [13] and enhance the electrical 
performance of OLED [14]. Thus, we 
improved the performances of pentacene and 
CuP with doping iodine.  
  
In this work, we investigate the 
performances of pentacene and CuPc with 
and without iodine doping through the 
measurement of surface roughness, doping 
profile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
atomic force microscopy (AFM), secondary 
ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) and 
current-voltage (I-V)/capacitance-voltage 
(C-V) measurements. Additionally, the 
mechanisms affecting the improvement of 
pentacene and CuPc doped iodine were 
discussed in detail. Experimental results 
found the current was significantly increased 
with bias for doped pentacene. In comparison 
to the reported methods, the doping iodine 
technology has the advantage of low cost, 
convenience and does not change the current 
OTFT preparation process and becomes the 
potential application for fabrication of high 
response OTFT. 
 
3. Device Design, Fabrication and 
Measurements 
As schematically shown in Fig.1 (a), the 
samples with configuration of Al/organic 
materials /Al (namely MSM-like) for 
current-voltage (I-V) measurement were 
prepared in the glass substrates. After 
ultrasonic cleaning in H2O-H2O2-NH3OH 
solution, the substrates were taken into a stain 
steel chamber which then be evacuated to 
1x10-5 Torr for deposition of 500Å pentacene 
or CuPc thin films. For I2 doped samples, 
mixed powder with weight ratio of 
pentacene/I2 or CuPc/I2 =1/50, was 
evaporated. Next, 1500Å Al was evaporated 
as electrode contact Additionally, the organic 
MOS-like samples with the structure of Al/ 
pentacene or CuPc / p- Si as shown in Fig.1 
(b) were prepared for capacitance-voltage 
(C-V) measurement. Finally, HP4156 and HP 
4284 were used to measure the electrical 
characteristics. Moreover, use SEM, AFM 
and SIMS for the surface morphology and 
doped iodine profile measurements, 
respectively. 
 
4. Results and Discussions 
Figure 2 presents the measured Current 
-Voltage (I-V) curves of MSM-like with and 
without iodine doped on organic materials 
pentacene or CuPc samples. As seen, without 
doping the current of pentacene (curve c) is 
larger than that of CuPc (curve a) under same 
bias owing to the higher mobility of highly 
oriented pentacene [15-17]. Furthermore, 
compared to without doping one for 
pentacene, the current of iodine doped sample 
(curve d) was significantly raised, for 
example, under bias 5 V and 10 V, the current 
was enhanced from 16.3 nA to 38.2 nA and 
 ~ 2 ~
capacitance decrease with increasing 
frequency owing to the Debye effect [21] 
 
Fig. 7 (a)-(b) show the normalized 
capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement with 
and without iodine doped on CuPc and 
pentacene samples at p- and n- substrate 
under 1MHz, respectively, and the inset 
illustrates the capacitance models, where Cog 
and Cj present for organic and interface 
capacitance, respectively. In the MOS-like 
capacitor, pentacee or CuPc films replaced 
oxide as insulator. For pentacene, as can be 
seen, in depletion region, the total 
capacitance is dominated by insulator 
(organic) one, thus due to the iodine negative 
free ions charge generated with doping, the 
C-V curve (c) right shifted to (d) for both of 
the p- and n MOS-like, respectively. The 
shifted amount is attributed to I3- iodine free 
ions generated in pentacene as disused above 
and the same as MOS diode in semiconductor 
[22]. However, the capacitor for CuPc is left 
shifted from curve (a) to (b). Obviously, the 
left shifted is contradiction to semiconductor 
MOS device thus still needs some more 
experiments to build a clear model. While, in 
the inversion region, the capacitance is major 
contributed from the organic material/ silicon 
substrate interface trap. It has been reported 
the quantity of trap density existed in 
pentacene / Si interface is larger than that in 
CuPc/Si interface [23-24] and evidenced by 
SEM cross-section micrographs of the 
organic materials/p-Silicon structure before 
doping shown in Fig.8(a) and 8(c), 
respectively. As seen, smoother interface is 
found for CuPc and results in lower 
capacitance. After doping, Fig. 8(b) and 8(d) 
show almost no changes in the interface for 
the two organic materials and lead to same 
capacitance before and after doping. We 
suppose the very small quantity of I2 
penetrated in interface as shown in Fig. 3 is 
responsible to the no changes in the interface. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The performances of pentacene and CuPc 
organic materials doped with iodine have 
been studied in detail. Compared to without 
doped one for pentacene, the current was 
significantly improvement from 16.3 nA to 
38.2 nA and 30.7 nA to 75.8 nA under bias 5 
V and 10 V, respectively, and large increasing 
with the bias increases. However, for CuPc 
doped, the current was slightly increasing. We 
attributed the obvious promotions to the 
morphological effect and iodine free ions 
were generated with iodine doped. The 
morphological effects were investigated by 
the morphology and surface roughness 
through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The iodine 
free ions generated could be evidenced with 
C-V measurement. The organic materials 
doped iodine technology possesses potential 
applications for fabrication high response 
organic thin film transistor (OTFT).
