Abstract 
 
Background 
High-throughput microarray experiments now permit researchers to screen thousands 
of genes simultaneously and determine the different expression levels of genes in 
normal or cancerous tissues. In this paper, we address the challenge of selecting a 
relevant and manageable subset of genes from a large microarray dataset.  Currently, 
most gene selection methods focus on identifying a set of genes that can further 
improve classification accuracy. Few or none of these small sets of genes, however, 
are biologically relevant (i.e. supported by medical evidence). To deal with this 
critical issue, we propose two novel methods that can identify biologically relevant 
genes concerning cancers. 
Results 
In this paper, we propose two novel techniques, entitled random forest gene selection 
(RFGS) and support vector sampling technique (SVST). Compared with results from 
six other methods developed in this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that RFGS 
and SVST can identify more biologically relevant genes in patients with leukaemia or 
prostate cancer. Among the top 25 genes selected using SVST method, 15 genes were 
biologically relevant genes in patients with leukaemia and 13 genes were biologically 
relevant genes in patients with prostate cancer.  Meanwhile, the RFGS method, while 
less effective than SVST, still identified an average of 9 biologically relevant genes in

Background  
The completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) has been recognized as 
a great achievement in the study of biomedicine; the project not only provided 
comprehensive information on the human genome but also inspired new ways to 
study human diseases such as cancers. Concurrent with the advancement of the HGP, 
several high-throughput and rapid gene function analysis techniques were developed. 
Among them, microarray may be the most mature technique, and it has become a 
major data resource in gene function research [1-3]. Over the past few years, 
microarray-based gene expression profiling has proven to be a promising approach in 
predicting cancer classification and prognosis outcomes [4-6]. In most cases, cancer 
diagnosis depends on using a complex combination of clinical and histopathological 
data. However, it is often difficult or impossible to recognize tumor types in atypical 
instances [7]. To translate microarray data into functional physiological information, a 
set of genes with the maximum amount of information and a minimum amount of 
noise is needed. For example, diagnostic tests that measure the abundance of a given 
protein in serum may be derived from a small subset of biologically relevant genes.  
In cancer classification, one of the reasons one may wish to select a minimum 
set of genes is to avoid an over-fitting problem caused by attempting to apply a large 
number of genes to a small number of samples.  There are several statistical and 
machine learning techniques such as t-Test, k-nearest neighbors, clustering methods 
[8], self organizing maps (SOM) [9], genetic algorithm [10], back-propagation neural 
network [11-13] , probabilistic neural network, decision tree [14], random forest [15], 
and support vector machines (SVM) [16, 17] that have been applied in selecting 
informative genes.  Although these methods can select smaller set of informative 
genes, only a small percentage of these so called “informative” genes are biologically 
relevant as proved by medical experiments. Our goal in this paper, therefore, is to best 
identify biologically relevant genes from a small set of genes using our proposed 
methods. We present a novel approach that addresses different considerations, 
including: (1) the identification of quality samples, (2) the selection of a small set of 
informative genes from these samples, (3) the comparison of these genes with medical 
literature, and (4) the interpretation of their biological relevance.

experiment results and discusses leukemia and prostate cancer. Finally, Section 5 
presents the conclusions of our study. 
Statistics-Based Gene Selection Methods 
Gene selection is widely used to select target genes in the diagnosis of cancers. 
One of the primary goals of gene selection is to avoid the over-fitting problems 
caused by the high dimensions and relatively small number of samples of microarray 
data.  Theoretically, in cancer classification, only informative genes which are highly 
related to particular classes (or subtypes) should be selected [24]. In microarray data 
analysis, the challenge is to select informative genes that clearly differentiate the 
classes. Since the number of informative genes is very small compared to the total 
number of genes in each experiment, utilizing a better search technique is critical. We 
divide such techniques into two main categories: statistics-based methods and 
machine learning-based methods.  In this section, we will discuss the statistics 
methods while addressing the machine learning-based methods in the next section. 
The statistics methods rank or score the discriminability of each gene based on 
its own gene expression patterns. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches for 
estimations of discriminability have been proposed. The parametric estimation 
approach assesses the discriminability of genes using a variety of statistical analyses, 
including Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), t-Test, and Least Significant Difference (LSD). 
Parametric estimation depends on exact expression levels and the number of replicate 
samples. The statistical criteria are based on the assumption that the data comes from 
some kind of distribution. Each parametric approach puts different weights on the 
variance and number of samples of the criteria. In this study, we use three parametric 
methods: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), t-Test, and Least Significant Difference (LSD).  
A gene is considered more informative if it possesses a larger corresponding score. 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) 
Each dataset consists of m samples and n genes. For each gene ig , we 
normalize the gene expression data by subtracting the mean (signal) and then dividing 
by the standard deviation of the expression value (noise).  Every sample is labeled 
with {+1,-1} (e.g. normal or cancer). We use the following formula to calculate each 
gene’s F score. 
 - 10 - 
Weighted Punishment on Overlap (WEPO). 
Threshold Number of Misclassification (TNoM) 
TNoM assumes that an informative gene has different values between the two 
classes, and thus we are able to separate these using a threshold value. A decision rule 
corresponding to a given expression level, such as sign (ax+b), is used to score the given 
gene and predict the unknown class. TNoM looks to select the values of a and b in order 
to minimize the number of errors:  
{ }∑ +×≠=
k
k b)G(i)sign(a(i)i)|bErr(a, ll    
i)|bErr(a, minTNoM(i)
ba,
=
   
We then rank these genes with a TNoM score and select the top 25 gene sets as the 
features. 
Minimum Distance to Modal Ranking (MDMR) 
The MDMR method first ranks all the sample values of a gene and then 
computes the minimum distance between these ranks and a modal rank. The ranking 
algorithm, described by Park et al [28], is used in this study. A score is defined as the 
minimum number of consecutive swaps needed to arrive at a perfect split of two 
classes. A score of 0 represents the gene that can split two classes exactly.  The 
MDMR score is defined as   
( )∑ ∑
∈ +∈

-1p 1q

where h(x) is the indicator function 



≤
>
=
0x0,
0x1,
h(x)
 
We then rank these genes with an MDMR score and select the top 25 genes for the 
study. 
Weighted Punishment on Overlap (WEPO) 
Chung et al. [30] proposed the WEPO method to reduce possible loss of 
information when using the TNoM or MDMR methods. Because genes with identical 
ordered expression data may not have the same discriminative power, WEPO 
introduces the z-score into the rank swapping scheme in order to avoid this problem. 
 - 12 - 
cycles, all genes will be ranked based on their score. In this paper, we select the top 
25 genes and confirm them based on supporting evidence culled from current medical 
literature. If the genes are found to have a relationship with the target cancers, we call 
them “biologically relevant genes”. Because the random forest approach may generate 
different biological genes each time, we run the code 10 times. Those genes which on 
average appear most consistently within the top 25 are used in comparison with the 
results of other methods.  
 This approach is displayed in the following pseudo code, where X is the 
cancer’s gene expression data (containing S samples and G genes) and the SY is the 
label of each sample.  
 
Support Vector Sampling Technique (SVST) 
In the ongoing effort to improve the accuracy of cancer classification, many 
machine learning methods have been developed over the past few years. Among them, 
SVM is arguably one of the best methods. Although the SVM classification method 
has been widely used in the machine learning domain, there is little research focused 
on the actual support vectors. These support vectors have several computational and 
learning theoretic consequences [32]. Gene selection is a common way to avoid the

Results and Discussion 
In this paper, we experiment using two cancer gene expression microarray 
datasets: leukemia and prostate cancer. We chose this data not only out of concern for 
the potential influence on human beings but also for the data’s characteristics. 
Leukemia microarray data is easily classified; many cancer classification researchers 
consider this data as a performance comparison standard. Prostate cancer microarray 
data, however, is not easily classified. Therefore, utilizing both datasets provides a 
measurable way to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed methods. 
Application to the leukemia microarray dataset 
Leukemia dataset 
This original gene expression data was downloaded from 
www.genome.wi.mit.edu/MPR/ [23].  The data contains 72 bone marrow or 
peripheral blood samples with either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The data set provides 7129 human genes produced by 
Affymetrix high-density olignucleotide microarrays. The intensity of gene expression 
is rescaled to normalize overall intensities for each microarray. Even though this data 
provides a plethora of genetic information, its feature dimension is too high for 
practical analysis. We need a selection method that can reduce this feature dimension. 
Identifying biologically relevant leukemia genes 
Table 2 compares the resulting biologically relevant genes in leukemia 
identified using the 8 methods. Among these 8 methods, WEPO finds the least 
number of biological genes at 5 genes, while TNoM identifies 6 genes. LSD and t-
Test both identify 7 biological genes. SNR and random forest identify 8 and 9 
biological genes respectively. SVST and MDMR find the most biologically relevant 
genes, where SVST identified 15 and MDMR identified 12. Our proposed SVST 
method has the best performance in terms of identifying biologically relevant genes 
for leukemia. 
 For the random forest method, we can identify, on average, 9 biologically 
relevant genes from the top 25 ranked genes.  In Table 2, we show the results of 
running the method 10 times and order the relevant genes by decreasing number of 
hits. As shown in Figure 3, 9 genes are recorded in the following order: MGST1 (7 
 - 18 - 
K562, the SPTAN1 mapped centromeric to the translocation breakpoint, indicating 
that the alpha-fodrin gene is not translocated to the Ph1 chromosome in this cell line 
[40]. The MPO gene: The tumour cells were positive for CD68 (KP1), CD68 (PGM1), 
lysozyme and CD45. They were negative for MPO, CD15, CD163, TdT, CD117, T 
and B cell markers [41]. The CST3 gene: Sun Y explores differentially expressed 
genes in leukemia gene expression profiles and identifies main related genes in acute 
leukemia. The results show that in four patient/donor pairs with ALL, 5 up-regulated 
(RIZ, STK-1, T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1A, Cbp/p300, Op18) and 1 down-regulated 
genes (hematopoietic proteoglycan core protein) were identified. In five patient/donor 
pairs with AML, 6 up-regulated (STAT5B, ligand p62 for the Lck SH2, CST3, 
LTC4S, myeloid leukemia factor 2 and epb72) and 1 down-regulated genes (CCR5) 
were identified [42]. The CD79A gene: Expression of the CD79A (MB-1) chain has 
been studied in leukemia and is shown to be present in most B lineage acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia [43]. The CCND3 gene: A 51-bp deletion was detected in 
CCND3 in a patient with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia [44]. The PSMB9 
gene: PSMB9 (LMP2) is expressed both in normal EBV latency and EBV-associated 
pathologies. EBV is associated with a variety of haematopoietic cancers such as 
African Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's, and adult T-cell leukemia [26]. The IL18 
gene: IL18 (IGIF) proposed to be designated as IL-18, selectively up-regulates 
ICAM-1 expression in KG-1 cells, a human myelomonocytic cell line, human IL-18 
was measurable in the plasma of leukemia patients [45]. The STOM gene: STORP is 
homologous to the STOM (Epb72) gene coding for the erythrocyte band 7 integral 
membrane proteins or stomatin. The STORP gene is positioned 2 kb upstream of the 
promyelocytic leukemia gene in a head-to-head configuration. [46]. 
Application to the prostate cancer microarray dataset 
Prostate cancer dataset 
The original gene expression data for prostate cancers is available at 
http://www. genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/cancer/datasets.cgi [47]. The dataset contains 
expression levels for 52 prostate tumor samples and 50 normal samples. Each sample 
contains 12600 genes measured using Afffymertix oligonucleotide arrays. We set the 
tumor sample to (-1) and the normal samples to (+1), and we then merged these data 
sets together for the 8 methods.

prostate epithelial cells whereas Ang-1 (ANGPT1) was expressed in epithelium and 
smooth muscle [50]. 
We also list the roles of the rest of the biological genes shown in Table 5. The 
TNFSF10 gene: the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors is implicated in 
TNFSF10 transcriptional activation in prostate carcinoma cells [51]. The S100A4 
gene: S100A4 protein is expressed in neither benign nor malignant prostatic 
epithelium nor in LNCaP and Du145 cells. The mechanism underlying absent S100A4 
expression in prostatic epithelium and cell lines may involve methylation [52]. The 
RBP1 gene: Altered CRBP1 expression and promoter hypermethylation occur in 
several tumours, these changes were investigated in prostate tumorigenesis [25]. The 
COL4A6 gene: COL4A6 expression is missing in nearly all cancerous tissues as 
evidenced by the Boolean function [53]. The PTGDS gene: Lipocalin-type 
prostaglandin D syntheses (L-PGDS) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) metabolites 
produced by normal prostate stromal cells inhibited tumor cell growth through a 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-dependent 
mechanism [54]. The SERBP1 gene: The expression of hepsin, uPA, PAI-RBP1 
(SERBP1), PAI-1, and factor XIII may influence fibrinolysis and are regulated by the 
tumour microenvironment [55]. The LMO3 gene: The protein encoded in this gene is 
a LIM-only protein (LMO), which is involved in cell fate determination. This gene 
has been noted to up-regulate in the prostate cancer samples [56]. The DIO2 gene: 
Subtype II tumours represent the second clinically aggressive tumour subclass, and 
the gene expression feature that characterizes this subgroup includes several genes 
identified in supervised analysis to be associated with both high grade and advanced 
stage cancer, such as HDAC9 and DIO2 [57]. The TARP gene: TARP is exclusively 
expressed in the prostate in males and is up-regulated by androgen in LNCaP cells, an 
androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line [58]. The HPN gene: Xu L has identified a 
pair of robust marker genes (HPN and STAT6) by integrating microarray datasets 
from three different prostate cancer studies [59]. 
  In Table 6, we summarize the results from related studies. Since few studies 
focus on identifying biologically relevant genes in cancers, we summarize their results 
based on the study’s computing methods. We then compare all these 8 gene selection 
methods, including our two proposed novel methods, with the results in Table 6. In 
different cancer types and methods, very few biologically relevant genes are identified. 
Our methods, especially our proposed SVST method, are significantly superior to

Preliminary study of gene-gene interaction of biologically relevant leukemia 
genes identified by the SVST method 
Due to the superior characteristics of our SVST method (i.e. identifying a 
greater number of biologically relevant genes and yielding better classification 
accuracy rates), we would like to further investigate the possible gene-gene 
interactions among these biologically relevant genes. Our hypothesis is that the gene-
gene interactions among these biologically relevant genes, if present, may provide 
additional benefits with regards to the diagnosis of cancers. As a preliminary study, 
we ran the experiment using 15 biologically relevant genes selected from a leukemia 
dataset.  At first, we screened several protein-protein interaction (PPI) websites, and 
we found the IPIR (integrated protein interaction resource, 
http://ymbc.ym.edu.tw/ipir/) to be an excellent tool for building PPI graphs of 
leukemia gene products. The IPIR is a powerful web tool which retrieves protein-
protein interaction information from BIND, DIP, HPRD, MINT, MIPS, and IntAct 
databases.  
The protein-protein interaction graph based on the 15 biologically relevant 
leukemia genes selected using the SVST method is displayed in Figure 7. The name 
of each gene is viewable by expanding the scale of graph.  In Figure 7, we find that 11 
biologically relevant genes (marked in red) out of 15 genes form a PPI graph. To 
further understand the relationships among these genes, we summarize the 
neighbourhood genes and bridge genes in Table 9. The 11 biologically relevant genes 
we found which have interactions are ZYX, TCF3, CD33, CD63, TCRA, SPTAN1, 
MPO, CST3, HOXA9, CD79A, and IL18.  Among these 11 genes, TCF3 has the 
largest number of interacting genes (47). SPTAN1 has the second largest number of 
interacted genes (46), and the remaining 9 genes (with the number of interacting 
genes shown in the subsequent parentheses) are: MPO (35), CD79A (16), ZYX (15), 
TCRA (15), CD63 (13), HOXA9 (13), CST3 (9), IL18 (8), and CD33 (3). 
There are several sub-networks among these genes. For instance, the sun-
network links ZYX with TCF3, CST3, and SPTAN1via NEDD9, ATXN1, and TES, 
respectively (marked in yellow). The sun-network links TCF3 with ZYX and HOXA9 
via NEDD9 and CREBBP, respectively. The sun-network links CD33 with CD79A 
and APTAN1 via PTPN6 and SRC, respectively. The sun-network links CD63 with 
TCRA via HLADRA. The sun-network links TCRA with CD63 and MPO via 
HLADRA and HSPA5, respectively. The sun-network links SPTAN1 with MPO,

8 or less genes in patients with prostate cancer, our methods yield significantly better 
results. The significance of identifying biologically relevant genes cannot be 
understated; research in the fields of biology and medicine can benefit substantially 
from the identification of biologically relevant genes to confirm recent discoveries in 
cancer research or suggest new avenues for exploration.

PSMB9 
The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is 
characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, 
Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly 
basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic 
activity. This subunit is involved in antigen processing to generate 
class I binding peptides. 
[26] 
IL18 
Augments natural killer cell activity in spleen cells and stimulates 
interferon gamma production in T-helper type I cells. 
[45] 
STOM 
Interacting selectively with one or more specific sites on a receptor 
molecule, a macromolecule that undergoes combination with a 
hormone, neurotransmitter, drug or intracellular messenger to 
initiate a change in cell function.
