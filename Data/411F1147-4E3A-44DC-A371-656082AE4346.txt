the high-κ GdOx layer, which is controlled by oxygen 
ions migration under negative and positive 
polarities. Then, improved resistive switching memory 
characteristics were demonstrated for an 
Al/Cu/Ti/TaOx/W structure with a Ti nanolayer at the 
Cu/TaOx interface under low voltage operation of ± 
1.5 V and a range of CCs from 0.1 to 500 &micro；A. 
Oxygen accumulation at the Ti nanolayer and formation 
of a defective high-κ TaOx film were confirmed by 
HRTEM, EDX, and XPS. The resistive switching memory 
parameters, such as HRS/LRS (~1e4), switching cycle 
stability (> 1e6), and multi-level operation, were 
improved compared with those of Al/Cu/TaOx/W devices. 
These results were attributed to the control of Cu 
migration/dissolution by the insertion of a Ti 
nanolayer at the Cu/TaOx interface.  
 Formation-free resistive switching for Ir/TaOx/W 
memory device in cross-point structure fully 
fabricated at room temperature has been achieved. 
Robust pulse endurance of >1e6 cycles with only ±2.5 
V/100 &micro；A is obtained. The multilevel data 
storage capability, narrow statistical distribution 
of memory parameters which are technologically of 
immense importance, read endurance of >6e5 times and 
85 oC data retention are also demonstrated. Crossbar 
resistive memory device in IrOx/GdOx/W structure also 
shows formation-free resistive switching with a small 
CC of 50 &micro；A. This memory device has excellent 
dc/ac endurances of >1e4 cycles, stable multi-level 
operation, and data retention of 1e4 s at 85oC. The 
memory devices in cross-point structure have great 
potential for future nanoscale non-volatile 3D 
architecture.

1. Introduction 
Being a powerful alternative to present conventional nonvolatile memory technologies, 
resistive memory (RRAM) devices have attracted considerable interest [1-2]. In such devices data bits 
can be stored as resistance making these devices easily scalable, faster and stackable. Other incentives 
of RRAM include its simple metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure, compatibility with standard 
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process and lower power consumption. Various 
solid-electrolytes such as GeSex [3-6], GeS [7, 8], Ta2O5 [9,10], ZrO2 [11], SiO2 [12], Ag2S [13,14], 
have been reported by several groups. In these cases, silver (Ag) or copper (Cu) metal can be used as 
one of the electrodes to mobilize Ag+ or Cu2+ ions. But, recently, transition metal oxides especially 
binary oxides have been proposed for resistive switching memories. Among other various oxides such 
as, NiO [15-17], TiOx [18], HfOx [19-22], Cr2O3 [23], Sm2O3 [24], CuOx[25], ZrO2 [26,27], AlOx [28-
30], WOx [31], SrTiO3 [1,2,32], Na0.5Bi 0.5TiO3 [33], ZnO [34,35], and so on, tantalum oxide (TaOx) 
based devices are becoming appealing due to its high dielectric constant (εr~25) and CMOS 
compatibility. However, the resistive switching characteristics using TaOx material has been reported 
infrequently [36,37]. On the other hand, tungsten oxide (WOx) is another promising material reported 
for RRAM applications due to its ease of fabrication and CMOS compatibility [31].  
 In this project report, we have investigated two kinds of resistive memory devices: (1) via 
structure and (2) cross-point structure. For via type devices, resistive memory stacks of 
IrOx/TaOx/WOx/W, IrOx/GdOx/WOx/W and Al-Cu/Ti/TaOx/W have been studied in detail. The 
fabricated memory devices have shown good essential memory characteristics such as uniform and 
reversible current-voltage (I-V) hysteresis, stable endurance and satisfactory data retention properties. 
In spite of these memory properties, devices have shown multilevel data storage capability, good 
device to device uniformity and read endurance characteristics. The underlying switching mechanisms

2. Experiment 
In this study, resistive switching memory devices in via structure as well as cross-point structure have 
been fabricated employing technologically important high-k materials such as TaOx and GdOx as 
resistive switching materials. Various resistive memory stacks of IrOx/TaOx/WOx/W, 
IrOx/GdOx/WOx/W and Al-Cu/Ti/TaOx/W in via structure and IrOx/GdOx/W and Ir/TaOx/W in cross-
point structure have been fabricated. To make via devices, a tungsten (W) metal layer of thickness 100 
nm as a bottom electrode (BE) was deposited by rf magnetron sputter system on 8” SiO2 (200 nm)/Si 
wafer. Then, a low temperature SiO2 (LTO) layer with a thickness of 150 nm was deposited on W BE. 
Different via sizes ranging from 0.4×0.4 to 8×8 µm2 were then defined by lithography and etching 
methods followed by another lithography step to pattern the device for lift-off. Next, a high-κ 
switching material layer of tantalum oxide (TaOx) with a thickness of approximately 10 nm for 
IrOx/TaOx/WOx/W stack and gadolinium oxide (GdOx) layer with the thickness of approximately 15 
nm for IrOx/GdOx/WOx/W stack were deposited by electron-gun evaporator using pure Ta2O5 and 
granules Gd2O3 pieces respectively. The thickness of TaOx was 18 nm for Al-Cu/TaOx/W memory 
devices. In order to deposit iridium oxide (IrOx) as a top electrode (TE), IrOx layer with a thickness of 
approximately 200 nm was deposited by reactive sputtering using Ir target (>99.999%). The ratio of Ar 
and O2 mixture was 1:1 and working pressure was maintained at 20 mTorr. The rf power used during 
deposition was 50 W. In case of Al-Cu/TaOx/W stack, copper (Cu) which provided mobile ions, was 
deposited at a layer thickness of approximately 50 nm by a thermal evaporator. A 160-nm-thick layer 
of Aluminum (Al) was then deposited in situ using the same thermal evaporator to protect the Cu 
surface layer from oxidation by the external environment. The total thickness of the top electrode (Cu + 
Al) was approximately 200 nm. Cu mobile ions play a major role in the Al-Cu/TaOx/W structure 
resistive switching memory device (device S1). In this S1 device, Cu is oxidized at the Cu/TaOx

pressure of Ar gas was maintained at 20 mTorr and rf power used for deposition was 50 W. To deposit 
iridium oxide (IrOx) as a top electrode (TE), IrOx layer with a thickness of approximately 200 nm was 
deposited by reactive sputtering using Ir target (>99.999%). The ratio of Ar and O2 mixture was 1:1 
and working pressure was maintained at 20 mTorr. The rf power used during deposition was 50 W. 
Finally, lift-off process was done to get the cross point resistive switching memory devices.       
  To know the film thickness, microstructure and interface among deposited stack layers, HRTEM 
image was acquired using FEI Tecnai G2 F-20 field emission system with an operating voltage of 200 
kV. The memory device for TEM observation was prepared using an FEI Helios-400s system with an 
operating voltage of 5 kV and Ga+ ion source was used to thin down the device. The TEM image was 
acquired within a short time of <5 s. The chemical elements present in various deposited layers for all 
the materials were investigated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). All materials 
compositions were studied by XPS using Al K∝ monochrome X-ray with energy of 1486.6 eV. The 
vacuum in analytical chamber was 1x10-9 Torr and a spot size of 650 µm in diameter was used to 
analyze the materials. In order to analyze W layer, the TaOx (~9nm) or GdOx (~14 nm) layer was 
etched out using 3 keV Ar ion sputtering in 100 and 150 s respectively. All the acquired spectra were 
calibrated by C1s peak at energy of 284.6 eV. Memory characteristics such as current-voltage (I-V) 
hysteresis, pulse endurance, read endurance and retention were performed using HP4156C precision 
semiconductor parameter analyzer and bias was applied on TE while BE was grounded. For cross-point 
resistive memory, the cross-point nearest to the probing pads is selected for the measurement. Current-
voltage (C-V) curves were measured using HP4284A LCR meter. The frequency applied during the C-
V measurements was 1 MHz. The capacitance was measured in parallel capacitance-conductance (Cp-
G) mode.

The device selected for TEM was fresh i.e. no any electrical measurement was performed. The memory 
device size is approximately 2 × 2 μm2. Very good conformal deposition (via filling) of all the 
materials is obtained. Fig. 1(b) shows the HRTEM image of the selected area in Fig. 1(a) where all the 
stack layers and their interfaces are clearly visible. The thicknesses of the TaOx and WOx layers are 
approximately 9 and 5 nm, respectively. The high-κ TaOx film is amorphous while the WOx is 
polycrystalline due to the presence of nano grains as can be clearly seen in the TEM image. The 
presence of oxygen (O) peak at the energy of approximately 0.52 keV in EDX spectra shown in Fig. 
1(c) indicates the formation of tantalum oxide and tungsten oxide layers. The composition of both the 
layers is confirmed by the XPS analysis. The XPS spectra of TaOx and WOx layers are shown in Fig. 
2(a) and (b) respectively. The peaks of Ta2O5 4f doublet with peak binding energies of 26.70 eV 
(Ta2O54f7/2) and 28.60 eV (Ta2O54f5/2) with peak separation of 1.9 eV are observed and are in well 
agreement with reported values [39]. Additionally, peaks corresponding to metallic tantalum (Ta) with 
peak binding energies of 21.77 eV (Ta4f7/2) and 23.74 eV (Ta4f5/2) [40] are also observed (Fig. 2(a)).  
The peaks of Ta2O5 along with metallic Ta ensure the sub-stoichiometric tantalum oxide (TaOx) film. 
The peaks corresponding to WO3 with peak binding energies of 36.21 eV (WO34f7/2) and 38.23 eV 
(WO34f5/2) in addition to peaks corresponding to metallic W 4f doublet with peak binding energies of 
31.63 eV (W4f7/2) and 33.88 eV (W4f5/2) are observed in the XPS spectra of WOx layer (Fig. 2(b)) 
which confirm the formation of tungsten oxide (WOx). These values of binding energies of W4f for W0 
in metallic tungsten and for W+6 in WO3 are in well agreement with the published literature [41]. Due 
to the bilayer structure of TaOx/WOx films, good resistive switching performance is obtained and 
explored hereafter.

Fig. 3 shows typical current-voltage (I-V) resistive switching characteristics of fabricated RRAM stack 
in an IrOx/TaOx/WOx/W structure. Before getting reversible bipolar resistive switching from pristine 
device, memory device is electroformed by applying negative bias on IrOx TE and resulting I-V curve 
is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The formation which is analogous to soft-break down occurs at a 
voltage (Vform) of -6.6 V with a set current compliance of 40 uA. During this soft-breakdown process, 
some of Ta-O bonds of TaOx film break and create oxygen vacancies (Vo) by releasing O2- ions. These

obvious dependence of LRS on device area ensuring the presence of localized conducting filaments. 
The switching mechanism is then governed by formation and rupture of conducting filaments 
comprised of oxygen vacancies illustrated schematically in Fig. 6. When negative voltage is applied on 
the IrOx TE, oxygen vacancies (Vo) migrate toward IrOx TE and form the filament in TaOx layer after 
sufficient electric field is reached bringing the device into LRS (Fig. 6(a)). In contrast, the oxygen ions 
(O2-) from TaOx layer move toward BE and recombine in WOx layer which acts as reservoir. Due to 
the presence of large number of oxygen vacancies, the WOx film behaves like conducting. This 
suggests that the conducting filament formation which results resistance switching can be observed in 
the TaOx layer. On the other hand, when positive voltage is applied on IrOx TE, O2- move from WOx 
layer toward TE and oxidize the conducting filament. As a result, filament ruptures and device goes to 
HRS (Fig. 6(b)). The similar phenomena of oxygen vacancy generation/recombination to form/rupture 
a conducting filament and hence switching the device between LRS and HRS is also reported for other

part of the filament remains (Fig. 6(b)) after reset operation. This suggests that the filament is 
formed/ruptured in the entire length of TaOx layer rather than only near the WOx/TaOx interface.  
3.1.2.3 Switching uniformity 
Fig. 7 shows the statistical analysis of memory parameters such as formation, set/reset voltage and 
LRS/HRS of fabricated resistive memory stack of IrOx/TaOx/WOx/W. The mean values of Vform, set 
(Vset), and reset (Vreset) voltages are -7.15, -2.08, and 1.26 V, respectively (Fig. 7(a)).  Small values of 
standard deviation (σ), which is the measure of dispersion, of formation, set and reset voltages are 
found to be 0.21, 0.35 and 0.27 respectively. The fabricated memory devices show good cumulative 
distribution of HRS and LRS as well with mean values of 2 MΩ and 2.56 kΩ respectively (Fig. 7(b)). 
A high resistance ratio (HRS/LRS) of approximately 8×102 is obtained, which is desirable for 
multilevel data storage applications. 
3.1.2.4 Endurance and retention characteristics 
 Fig. 8 shows the pulse switching endurance of memory device of more than 8 x 102 cycles. The pulse 
width used for program/erase is 10 ms. Even though, fluctuations in the resistance states especially in 
LRS are observed during course of measurement, the memory device is alive after endurance test. 
Further study is needed to understand the fluctuations in the resistance states. It is expected that better 
switching endurance can also be obtained due to the TaOx/WOx bilayer design in 1T-1R configuration. 
Fig. 9 shows the data retention characteristics of fabricated memory device at 85 °C. Both, low and 
high resistance states remain stable without any noticeable degradation during testing and over 104 s of 
data retention is achieved. The ratio of HRS to LRS is more than 102 which is sufficient for memory 
applications.

Figure 10(a) shows the HRTEM image of RRAM device. All layers are observed clearly. The thickness 
of the GdOx and WOx layers are approximately 15 nm and 5.5 nm, respectively. The GdOx film shows 
a small crystalline grain while the WOx film shows polycrystalline. The d-spacing of the crystalline 
GdOx nanograins is 1.92 Å. It is very important to note that the filament can be guided by the Gd-rich 
nanograins or nanocrystals.

Gd2O3 film. The Gd 3d5/2 and Gd2O3 3d5/2 peaks are located at 1186.73 and 1189 eV, respectively, 
which proves Gd:Gd2O3 mixture [46]. The height ratio of Gd:Gd2O3 is 1:0.93 and area ratio of 
Gd:Gd2O3 is 1:0.89, which suggests a Gd-rich GdOx film. Fig. 12(b) shows the WO3 element with an 
energy peak at 35.48 eV [47]. So WOx layer formed on the surface of W BE. So it is GdOx/WOx 
bilayer structure. 
         3.2.2 Electrical characterization of IrOx/GdOx/WOx/W memory stack 
3.2.2.1 Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics 
Fig. 13 shows the typical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the IrOx/GdOx/WOx/W memory 
device. Initially virgin state of the device is found to be insulating. In order to activate the resistive 
switching, an initial soft breakdown process (forming) is carried out by applying negative and positive 
bias on the TE for negative and positive formation polarity, respectively. A forming voltage of 
approximately -6.4V is needed to activate resistive switching behavior for negative polarity whereas 
the forming voltage of approximately +3.6V is needed for positive polarity (not shown here). 
Considering the work functions of IrOx (Φm~5.2 eV) [48] and W  (Φm~4.3-4.93 eV) [49] electrodes, 
the electron injection from the IrOx electrode is lower as compared to that of the W electrode owing to 
the higher barrier height at the IrOx/GdOx interface. It reveals that the value of formation voltage under 
negative polarity is higher than that of the positive polarity. It is one of the reasons to improve the 
resistive switching parameters by lowering the formation voltage or by selecting the formation polarity. 
After negative formation and 1st RESET operation, typical I-V hysteresis characteristics with five 
consecutive cycles are shown in Fig. 13(a). The SET and RESET voltages are -2.4 and +1.9V, 
respectively. A huge variation of the I-V characteristics with cycle-to-cycle is observed, which may be 
due to large formation voltage, i.e., many weak conduction paths created in the switching material or

WOx layer. In consequence the oxygen vacancies (Vo) will move from WOx layer to the GdOx layer. 
Then oxygen vacancy filament will be formed in the GdOx layer or the oxygen vacancy filament can be 
guided by the Gd-rich GdOx nanograins. So the device switches to LRS. The conducting filament will 
be ruptured by applying positive bias on the TE and the device switches to HRS. In this case, O2- ions 
will move from the WOx layer toward the GdOx switching layer and oxidize the conducting filament. 
Basically, the conducting filament formation/rupture is due to the oxygen ions migration. Under 
positive formation polarity on the TE, the Gd-O bonds will be also broken and releases the O2- in to the 
GdOx layer. Due to the positive polarity on the TE, the O2- will move toward the GdOx/TE interface. It 
suggests that the GdOx layer is separated in to two layers, i.e, oxygen vacancy and oxygen rich GdOx 
layers. The oxygen rich layer will be formed near the TE and oxygen vacancy layer will be formed 
near WOx layer. The conduction channels can be formed in the oxygen vacancy layer of GdOx 
switching material. The oxygen vacancy as a positive charge sets the LRS with a series insulator near 
the TE. The HRS occurs due to electron trapping or de-trapping holes in the oxygen vacancy layer of 
GdOx switching material. So charge trapping and de-trapping phenomena leads the LRS and HRS, 
respectively. To investigate the conduction mechanism of our memory device under positive formation 
polarity, I-V curves are plotted in log-log scale (not shown here). LRS and HRS both shows space-
charge-limited current conduction (SCLC), which consists of a Ohmic region (I ∞V) and a Child’s law 
region (I∞V2). It suggests that switching mechanism is based on the trapping and de-trapping of 
charges between the WOx and oxygen-rich GdOx layers. The charge trapping and de-trapping 
phenomena in the high-κ GdOx layer has been explained below. 
             The charge trapping properties have been investigated by using capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
measurement in a n-Si/SiO2/GdOx/IrOx metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure, as shown in Fig. 
14. After cleaning the n-Si surface, the SiO2 tunneling oxide with a thickness of 3 nm was deposited.

3.2.2.3 Memory device uniformity 
Uniformity of both SET/RESET voltages and HRS/LRS are very important for realization of memory 
device application. Using randomly selected 20 devices, SET/RESET voltages and HRS/LRS have 
been measured for positive formation polarity with device-to-device and 100 cycle-to-cycles, as shown 
in Fig. 15. The average (standard deviation) SET and RESET voltages of device-to-device are +1.8V 
(0.079) and -1.81V (0.075), while those values for cycle-to-cycle are +1.87V (0.042) and -1.84V 
(0.041), respectively. Similarly average (standard deviation) HRS and LRS for device-to-device are 
197 kΩ (12.95) and 8.24 kΩ (1.64), while those values for cycle-to-cycle are 206.19 kΩ (16.21) and 
8.64 kΩ (1.56), respectively. Excellent uniformity of SET/RESET and HRS/LRS have been observed 
under positive formation polarity, which is very useful for nanoscale nonvolatile memory applications.

are found to be 7.2 kΩ and 265 kΩ for positive formation polarity, respectively. The LRS under 
positive formation polarity is higher than that of the values under negative formation polarity owing to 
the series resistance effect or oxygen-rich GdOx layer at the GdOx/IrOx interface. Both the LRS and 
HRS resistances can be retained for more than 104 seconds with a high resistance ratio of >103 at room 
temperature and 85 oC for negative formation whereas resistance ratio of >10 at RT and 85 oC for 
positive formation polarity. It is indicating that the memory device is nonvolatile and stable at RT and 
also at 85 oC. Moreover, the devices show semiconducting behavior in both positive and negative 
formation polarity bias because the resistance decreases with temperature.

the highest of any layer in the resistive switching memory device. These findings suggest that the Ti

improved resistive switching memory characteristics as described below.

formed, suggesting that Cu migration was controlled by the TiOx layer. In this case, the initial filament 
formation of a pristine device depends on a few switching cycles rather than the formation voltage, 
which is commonly needed for a ReRAM device. Therefore, this provides an advantage for future real 
applications of Cu metallic filament resistive switching memory devices. The present device also only 
requires very low operation voltage of ±1 V with a current of only a few nano-amperes. Although it has

Cu/TaOx interface controlling the migration of Cu ions under SET operation. Therefore, one of the 
major reasons that control of the Cu ion mobilization is easier in the device with Ti is because of the 
higher defective TaOx solid-electrolyte. Under RESET operation, either the filament is almost 
dissolved (Fig. 24(d)) or the gap length (i.e. the length between the Cu electrode and the remaining 
filament, or length of filament dissolution) in the S2 devices is longer than that of the S1 devices. The 
longer gap length of the S2 devices produced a higher resistance ratio (approximately 104 vs. 10, 
respectively) than that exhibited by the S1 devices because of the easier dissolution of the Cu filament

are used. Excellent switching uniformity with small set/reset (1.4/-1.8) voltage and large memory 
window (HRS/LRS) of >100 is achieved. The set, reset power of the memory device is calculated to be 
140 µW and 120 µW respectively, which is low enough for power consuming nonvolatile memory 
applications. The typical value of average surface roughness of tungsten BE in the cross-points is about 
8 nm which is higher than that of the flat surface (~1 nm) memory device (generally formation is 
needed) [58]. This suggests that the rough surface of BE helps to concentrate the electric field which in 
turn facilitates and controls the filament formation. This results formation free and uniform resistive 
switching.

Fig. 38 shows the schematic view of our IrOx/GdOx/W cross-point memory device. Inset figure shows 
the optical microscope image of our cross-point memory device. The device size is 4 x 4 µm2. For 
simplicity, only first cross-point (marked in Fig. 38) has been selected for the measurement. Fig. 39 
shows cross sectional HRTEM image of cross-point memory device. Each layer is clearly observed 
from the HRTEM image (Fig. 39). Thickness of GdOx film is approximately 17.5 nm and it is 
polycrystalline in nature. EDX spectra, shown in Fig. 40, confirm the presence of all the expected 
elements such as Ir, Gd, W and O in respective layers.

3.4.2.2 Electrical characterization of cross-point memory 
3.4.2.2.1 Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics 
 Typical bipolar current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for both as deposited and anneal sample are 
shown in Fig.41. The direction of I-V curve with a current compliance (Icc) of 300 µA are indicated as 
follows 1→4. Initially no formation is needed to initiate the resistive switching behavior. The surface 
roughness of W bottom electrode and pre-existing defects in the GdOx film during deposition are the 
key of our forming free resistive switching, owing to the higher defects in percolation length. That’s 
why formation free resistive switching memory is obtained. The annealing device is showing higher 
high resistance state (HRS) as compared to the as-deposited one, which is unwanted defects annealed 
out, resulting in a higher resistance ratio (HRS/LRS). The annealed device shows repeatable 
consecutive 100 switching cycles with a small operation voltage of ±3V.

3.4.2.2.3 Multilevel data storage operation 
Fig. 43 shows the multi-level I-V curve with ICCs of 50-300 µA. With increasing the current 
compliance, the conducting path through the GdOx layer becomes more conducting. That’s why with 
increasing the ICC, resistance level in the low resistance gradually decreases. Fig. 44 shows excellent 
multi-level retention characteristics with ICCs. After 103 s., the resistance ratio (HRS/LRS) for 50, 100, 
and 300 µA are approximately 10, 100, and 500, respectively. Fig. 45 shows the multi-level operation 
with variation of stop voltages. When negative bias applied on the TE, O2- are migrated and oxidation 
length of the conducting path at the TE/GdOx interface increases with increasing the negative voltages. 
That’s why current level in the high resistance state gradually decreases. Fig. 46 shows the multi-level 
retention characteristics with variation of stop voltages. Obviously, the resistance ratio increases with 
increasing the stop voltages.

defective high-κ TaOx solid-electrolyte. The high-κ TiOx and TiOx films were amorphous as observed 
by HRTEM. The oxygen accumulation properties of the Ti nanolayer at the Cu/TaOx interface were 
confirmed by EDX and XPS analyses. Good uniformity with large resistance ratio of approximately 
104, long P/E endurance of > 106 cycles, MLC operation, and 10 year data retention were observed for 
the devices with Ti nanolayer at the Cu/TaOx interface.  
 To further increase the density of resistive memory devices as well as operational power for 
highly desired high density low power non-volatile memory applications, resistive memory properties 
in a cross-point structure have been investigated in the second section of this report. Formation free 
cross-point resistive switching memory stack of Ir/TaOx/W has shown low set/reset power, high 
uniformity, long ac endurance of >106 cycles in 1R configuration with a small current of 100 µA. The 
rough surface of BE helps to defective TaOx film and concentrate the electric field which controls 
easily the formation/rupture of filament. Furthermore, good read endurance of >6x105 times and data 
retention of >3 hours at 85 oC are also achieved. The cross-point novel memory device in IrOx/GdOx/W 
structure has also shown promising memory characteristics. Each layer clearly observed from HRTEM 
image. EDX spectra confirm the presence of expected elements. Memory device is showing forming 
free, good endurance, excellent multi-level operation with variation of current compliance as well as 
variation of stop voltage, good AC endurance of 104 cycles, excellent read endurance of 105 cycles, and 
stable data retention of 104 s 85 oC with a high resistance ratio. The memory devices show the great 
potential for future nanoscale nonvolatile memory device applications. The devices with cross-point 
structure will be useful for nanoscale non-volatile 3D memory applications.

T.-J. K. Liu, University of California, Berkeley reported that steady miniaturization of the 
transistor has yielded continual improvements in integrated-circuit performance and cost per function 
over the past four decades, resulting in the proliferation of information processing technology with 
dramatic impact on virtually every aspect of life in modern society. Continued transistor scaling will 
not be as straight forward in the future as it has been in the past, however, as fundamental limits are 
approached. That is already apparent from the slowdown in supply voltage (VDD) scaling, which has 
added a new constraint for CMOS chip design and exacerbates the emerging issue of electronics 
energy consumption. Alternative approaches for improving chip functionality, cost per function and 
energy efficiency eventually will be necessary to sustain the rapid growth of the semiconductor 
industry beyond the next decade.

         H. Ohno reported that the scalability of Spin RAM has been determined by both materials and 
process integration development. It is a big challenge and is difficult to predict how far in dimension 
one can go at this point. One thing that can be pointed out is that the spintronics nonvolatile memory 
approach has solid grounds in terms of science and technology; there is an established magnetism and 
magnetic materials science base together with a large hard disk drive industry. T. Ohsawa et al. 
reported a novel STT-SRAM cell to show that its SNM is enhanced by 25% due to the MTJ switching. 
It is estimated that the MTJ size and its MgO thickness scaling can contribute to reduce its cell size 
down to the 6T SRAM cell size and smaller. H. Koike et al. discussed about “A Study for Adopting 
PMOS Memory Cell for 1T1R STT-RAM with Asymmetric Switching Current MTJ”. The problem in 
1T1R STT-RAM write operation originated from asymmetric switching current of MTJ has been 
analyzed in detail. F. Iga et. al. reported the improved switching probability and writing speed of the 
STT-RAM. They experimentally demonstrated that the switching probability and switching speed of 
STT-RAM can be improved by proposed 2step writing method. In the case of 1-write of Vb=0.6V, 
switching probability was improved about 20% without raising switching pulse voltage. Moreover, 
they have developed 2step pulse current generator with 90nm CMOS process that can successfully 
generate proposed 2 step current pulse with switching pulse of 450 ps. 
 
100/09/28   Session F-2: Advanced Memory Technology (Area 4)  
 
Ferroelectric memories have been extensively investigated for over two decades, but have only 
recently been emerging as a mainstream nonvolatile memory technology, reported by R. Udayakumar, 
Texas Instruments. FRAMs are distinguished by fast write speeds, low-voltage, low power operation, 
high cycling endurance and architectural flexibility. These memories have found applications in 
various sectors including business machines, instrumentation, medical equipment, industrial 
microcontrollers, radio frequency identification tags, etc. Production devices exhibit 1014 write/read 
cycles and more than 10 years at 85ºC data retention. He provides an overview of the development of 
this technology from the ferroelectric capacitor development phase through its integration within a 
130nm, 5LM copper CMOS platform through demonstration of its reliability. Trinh et. al. was 
designed and demonstrated a FGT-NAND memory array using only ferroelectric-gate thin film 
transistors with solution-processed channel and gate insulator. A wide memory window (3V) and a 
large on/off current ratio (106) were obtained for each cell. Importantly, the big issue on the data-
disturbance of the conventional NAND circuit was solved with a small loss of the stored signal.  
An optimized process of R-TiO2 MIMcap is demonstrated by K. Tomida et. al., without Ru pre-
oxidation, a smaller number of cycles of Ti-H2O, and a longer O3 pulse in Ti-O3 process. The 
optimized process gives not only a good Jg-EOT relation (Jg~10-8A/cm2 at EOT~0.68nm), but also an 
optimal WIW-NU. In addition, the leakage mechanism is found to be trap related and the trap strongly 
depends on the phase of TiOx. This implies that the Jg of the stacks can be further improved by

100/09/29   Session F-5: Advanced Memory Technology (Area 4)  
 
     C. H. Chou et. al. reported that new operation schemes were demonstrated for a split gate SONOS 
cell. This new scheme used the same strategy of back-bias assisted electron injection (for program) and 
hole injection (for erase). Also, it is well suited for two-bit operation. Several salient features of the 
new scheme include: (1) lower voltage and high speed operation, (2) better mismatch of electrons and 
holes for 2-bit operation, (3) better endurance as a result of a better control of the charge injections, 
and (4) expected good retention for reasons of good mismatch. H. Kusai et. al. reported the MONOS 
(SiN ~2 nm) device. They found that charge loss through the tunnel layer during data retention 
becomes more significant with decreasing the SiN thickness. To improve performance and reliability 
of MONOS devices with ultra-thin SiN charge trap layer, some measure must be taken to enhance the 
capture cross-section of the traps and to inhibit carrier motion in the SiN layer simultaneously. S.-H. 
Liu et. al. reported that the NH3 plasma pre-treatment significantly improves the quality of the 
interface between NCs and Si3N4. At the same time, it also effectively eliminates the unnecessary 
shallow trap sites and interface states to approach the really perfect data retention property. Besides, 
the NH3 PT yielded device owns the superior endurance characteristics, with nonsignificant memory 
narrowing, due to the hydrogen passivation in the interface states between Si-sub and tunnel oxide. In 
the NAND-type MLC operation, NH3 plasma treated memory also exhibits very exceptional reliability 
properties.  
 
100/09/30   Session F-6: Advanced Memory Technology (Area 4)  
 
     J. Tominaga delivered his talk about “Entropy-controlled Phase-change Memory”. Phase-change 
memory (PCM) has recently been more attracted as one of the promising nonvolatile solid-state 
memories because of its simple cell design and good performance in Set-Reset cycles. Up to now, in 
PCM, amorphous- crystal phase transition has been applied to record and erase data, as well as optical 
phase-change memory such as a DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and rewritable Blue-ray disc. In very recent, a 
new type of PCM has been designed, which does no longer relay on amorphous-crystal phase-
transition, but on crystal-crystal phase-transition. The new phase-change memory is called “interfacial 
or intelligence phase-change memory (IPCM),” because the solid-solid phase transition only occurs at 
interfaces between an atomically controlled thin GeTe layer and Sb2Te3 layer. Due to the interfacial 
switching, Ge atoms can only flip-flop between octahedral (low resistance) and tetrahedral (high 
resistance) bonding states. In such a super lattice, the <111> direction of a GeTe fcc lattice and the c-
direction of Sb2Te3 hexagonal lattice align each other, and all the other elements in Sb2Te3 layers do 
not take part in the switching. As a result, entropic loss accompanied with melting and phase-change at 
a high temperature is greatly depressed. In this paper, we present the entropic loss in PCM devices and 
introduce our concept to greatly reduce switching energy in comparison with current PCRAM device 
trends. C. Ahn et. al. reported that an issue of practical importance for the development of multi-level 
PCM cell is the drift of the cell resistance. Since the drift leads to an increase in the amorphous state 
resistance with time, the dependence of the crystallization process on the resistance drift is an 
important property to be investigated. In their work, the crystallization behavior of the PCM cell was 
studied at shorter time scales (μsec) using a doped SbTe phase-change alloy and an on-chip Micro-
Thermal Stage (MTS). It was found that a time delay between thermal disturbances can increase the 
effective activation energy for crystallization and this effect could be utilized to suppress the re-
crystallization due to thermal disturb from neighboring cells. J. Woo et. al. demonstrated significant 
improvement in resistive switching uniformity of Ge2Sb2Te5 based ReRAM devices by introducing 
interfacial oxide layer acting as an IR. Interfacial oxide was grown by simple oxidation process at low 
temperature. Highly uniform distribution of both resistance states can be achieved by limiting current 
at LRS. Furthermore, the devices exhibited good memory performance such as large on/off resistance 
 6 
also obtained. The multi-level operation is achieved by both current compliance and stop voltage 
changes. This crossbar ReRAM device can be useful in future nanoscale (<20 nm) 3D IC integration. 
S. M. Sadaf et. al. reported the switching uniformity and reliability of RRAM device with 
W/NbOx/Pt structures. Scaling down active device area (Φ = 250 nm) can significantly minimize the 
extrinsic defects related non-uniform switching which was normally observed in large area (μm scale) 
device. Electro migration of oxygen ions under the bipolar electric field and lightning-rod effect 
localized at WOx/NbOx interface can explain the improved switching behavior. Good device 
characteristic such as lower switching voltages, fast switching speed (100 ns), high temperature 
retention (> 104 sec, 85°C), stable cycling endurance (107 cycles), almost 100% device yield, and 
excellent device to device uniformity are obtained. 
 
100/09/30   Session F-9: Advanced Memory Technology (Area 4)  
 
     My student, Mr. S. Z. Rahaman reported a novel resistive switching memory device in a 
Cu/GeOx/W structure. High performance resistive switching characteristics with excellent uniformity 
of HRS/LRS and SET/RESET, excellent read endurance of 105 cycles, multi-level operation, and a 
stable resistance ratio of 105 for bipolar and 109 for unipolar operations maintaining up to 10 years of 
data retention are obtained. The memory device could be operated as low current as 1 nA. This 
resistive memory device can be useful in future logic circuit operation with a low current operation of 
<1 μA and nonvolatile memory with a reasonable high current operation. I reported a novel resistive 
switching memory device with Ti interfacial layer in an Al/Cu/TiOx/TaOx/W structure with a large 
resistance ratio of >102, excellent endurance of 104 cycles and extra-plotted 10 years data retention. 
The resistive memory device could be operated as current as 1 mA. This resistive memory device is 
very useful in future nonvolatile memory devices below 20 nm technology node. Q. Liu proposed a 
novel forming operating method to obtain a reliable Cu/SixNy/Pt ReRAM device.  
 
Conclusion:  
 
The SSDM conference was very good, especially for different memory devices. I have learned 
process and recent progress of different ReRAM devices. Although the resistive switching mechanism 
is unclear and uniformity/yield is not enough, however, the ReRAM devices are the possible candidate 
to replace flash beyond 20 nm technology node. 
 
 
 
Report on “1st International Workshop on Resistive RAM”, Oct. 20-21, 
Leuven, Belgium, 2011 
 
           It was my great pleasure and opportunity to join such a RRAM workshop in IMEC, 2011. All 
leading companies and academics came to share their expertise to develop the RRAM technology for 
future nanoscale nonvolatile memory applications. Total 182 participants were attended this workshop 
including 4 keynotes, 19 invited talks, 32 posters, and 2 panel discussions. I had invited talk and I was 
so pleased to present our recent CBRAM data in front of the leading groups in the World.  
 
 
Apologize:  
    I am really sorry for delay submission this report. Thanks a lot for your consideration.
