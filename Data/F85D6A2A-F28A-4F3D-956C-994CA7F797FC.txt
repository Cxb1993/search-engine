Abstract 
Tumor angiogenesis is an important indicator in the assessment of tumor growth and metastasis. 
Ultrasound has become an important tool to investigate the vascularity of the breast tumors and distinguish 
between benign and malignant lesions. However, ultrasound imaging usually contains a large number of 
noises and speckles which will have a considerable impact for physicians to diagnose. Therefore, noise 
filtering and extracting features from the tumor vascularity are very important and useful for physicians to 
diagnose. This project utilizes the mathematical morphological operations to filter noise and speckles and to 
extract morphological feature in three-dimensional (3D) High-definition flow (HDF) Doppler ultrasound 
images of the chemotherapy treatments of breast cancer. We also observe the correlation between these 
features and the chemotherapy effect for these patients. This project evaluates 16 malignant breast lesions 
(each lesion included five or six times chemotherapy treatments). The proposed method utilizes 3D 
mathematical morphological operations – closing and opening to reduce the noise and speckles in the 3D 
HDF Doppler ultrasound imaging. A 3D thinning algorithm is performed to obtain vascularity centerlines. 
Then this project extracts thirteen morphological features and three vascularity direction features based on the 
inside volume of interest (VOI), boundary VOI, outside VOI and entire VOI. Finally, this study observes the 
correlation between the features and chemotherapy effect.

performed to improve the thinning accuracy. Finally, morphological features included vascularization index 
(VI), number of vessel trees (NT), length of vessel (LV), number of branching (NB), number of neighbor 
voxel (NN), branching neighbor voxel (BN) , priority distance metric (PDM), average distance metric (ADM), 
number of cycle (NC), mean of radius (MR), vascularization flow index (VFI) , thinning flow index (TFI), 
flow index (FI), blue voxel ratio (BVR), number of change direction (NCD) and average number of change 
direction (ANCD) were extracted from the HDF Doppler ultrasound imaging. Figure 1 shows the flow chart 
of the proposed method.

2. Materials and Methods 
Patients and chemotherapy 
Patients were recruited into this study consecutively from July 2007 to July 2008. Sixteen consecutive T2 
breast cancer (Tumor size > 2cm and ≤ 5cm) patients, who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at Changhua 
Christian Hospital, were recruited for this study. The diagnosis of breast cancer was made by core needle 
biopsy. Pre-operative intravenous chemotherapy was given for six courses in each patient and three weeks per 
cycle with FEC. Epirubicin (Pharmorubicin, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York City, NY, USA) 80-90 mg/m2, 
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 and 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 on day 1 every three weeks. Sonography

be removed without changing the topology of the object. The thinning operator set out to from the object’s 
boundary and continues inward until no more simple points can be removed. The vessel centerline of the 3D 
object will be obtained after 3D thinning operator. 
This study utilized the parallel 3D 12-subiteration thinning algorithm proposed by Palagyi et al. [15] to 
thin the noise-reduced 3D HDF Doppler ultrasound images. The advantages of the thinning algorithm are that 
can achieve excellent efficiency and implement easily. The operator produces either curve skeletons or 
surface skeletons from 3D binary objects in (26, 6)-connectivity by repetitive iterations until no more points 
need to be removed. The algorithm performs a good efficiency since a single iteration step contains 12 sub 
iterations in which can be executed in parallel. 
The vascularity centerline was extracted from the thinned 3D HDF Doppler ultrasound images. However, 
the blood flow points might fail to be thinned correctly or might locate together to become a surface region 
due to the object is too complex. This situation was called as multiple voxels wide skeletons (MVWS) 
problem in this study. The MVWS regions were harmful for feature extraction. Therefore, elimination of the 
MVWS after 3D thinning was necessary to obtain the correct vessel centerline. Moreover, the colour of voxel 
within the HDF Doppler ultrasound imaging indicates the direction information of blood flow which would 
annotate to each point in the vascular centre-line. Figures 2 show the process of vascular centre-line extraction 
in a 3D HDF Doppler imaging.

outside VOI and boundary VOI. The extracted features were vascularization index (VI), number of vessel 
trees (NT), length of vessel (LV), number of branching (NB), number of neighbor voxel (NN), branching 
neighbor voxels (BN), priority distance metric (PDM) [18], average distance metric (ADM), number of cycle 
(NC), mean of radius (MR), vascularization flow index (VFI), thinning flow index (TFI), flow index (FI), blue 
voxel ratio (BVR), number of change direction (NCD) and average number of change direction (ANCD), 
respectively.  
 
3. Result 
The chemotherapy treatment effect of the sixteen patients was evaluated by the clinical tumor response. 
The clinical tumor response was classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease 
(SD) or progressive disease (PD) [19] described as followed: 
z Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. 
z Partial response (PR) is defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target 
lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. 
z Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the 
target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
z Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions since the treatment 
started. 
In this study, the length of the tumor in the 3D HDF Doppler ultrasound images was selected as the target 
lesions. Patients were classified into two groups: the responder, which was classified as CR or PR, and the 
nonresponder, who was classified as SD or PD. Table 1 shows the classified result of response of patients. The 
D1, D2, D3 were the length of the tumor before chemotherapy measured in three different viewpoints. We 
selected the largest of the three viewpoints as the starting target lesion and the pathology length of tumor is 
the ending target lesion. The decrease of the target lesion was calculated by 
In this study, the simulation evaluated the vascularization indices from both the responder and 
non-responder groups to identify practical features for tumor angiogenesis. The results indicated that the 
indices VI, NT, LV, NB, FI, FDC and PDM that extracted from all the three regions would be potential early 
predictors for good responses to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. The indices NN and AFDC within the VOI area, 
VFI on the boundary area and NC from the entire volume area were beneficial as well. Figures 4 illustrate the 
variations of number of vascular centre-lines from the three areas during the six ultrasound examinations. The 
blue and green lines are the responder cases. The yellow and red lines are the non-responder cases. The 
decreasing tendency towards responder is more evident in the early examinations than that of the 
non-responder cases. Figures 5-6 show the variations of frequency of direction changes in vascular 
centre-lines and vascularization flow index. Figures 7-8 illustrate the variations of average number of 
neighbours for vascular centre-line points and number of cycles of vascular centre-lines. 
All analyses were made on a single CPU Intel Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz personal computer with Microsoft 
Windows XP® operating system and 2 GB memory. The programs were performed using C++.net language

could decrease the unnecessary chemotherapy treatments for patients. In addition, an automatic segmentation 
system could be utilized for 3D HDF Doppler ultrasound imaging of breast tumors in place of the generation 
of VOI to improve the accuracy of the proposed features. The proposed features will be utilized to classify the 
breast tumors into benign and malignant lesions.
