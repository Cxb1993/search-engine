???Generation "New"- Does Innovation Change Our Culture?
At any time in history we have seen a comparable transition within society. Today the
speed of innovation has reached a critical pace: Mobile communication, broadband internet,
new media etc. have changed our life in a fundamental way. The generation gap is widening
and new global business structures challenge our traditional models. Leaps in innovation
induce disorientation within enterprises and in societies. How is innovation changing our
culture?
