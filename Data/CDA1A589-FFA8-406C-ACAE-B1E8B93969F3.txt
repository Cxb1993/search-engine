1.  Introduction and Literatures 
 
To measure the contribution of a single 
component or a specific position in a system 
towards the system reliability, various 
reliability importance indices have been 
proposed and widely studied— Birnbaum 
importance, combinatorial importance, 
structural importance, and half-line 
importance, for example [2-6, 11, 12, 15].  
In this paper, we concern the importance 
index between two components. 
Joint reliability importance (JRI) of two 
components is a measurement of the degree 
of interactions between two components in a 
system.  The definition of JRI is as follows.

denotes the states of n  components.  JRI 
was first proposed independently by 
Hagstrom [7] and by Hong and Lie [10], and 
then attracted many researches [1, 8-10, 14].  
The value of JRI is positive (negative) if and 
only if one component becomes more (less) 
important when the other is functioning.  
Hong et al. proposed several properties of 
JRI of the k -out-of- n  system [9].  
However, some of their results are incorrect. 
In this project, we study the JRI in three 
kinds of systems: the k -out-of- n  system, 
the series-parallel system, and the 
consecutive 2-out-of- n  system.  In the k - 
out-of- n  system, we re-state the properties 
of JRI of the 2-out-of- n  system and correct 
the errors in the paper by Hong et al. [9].  
We compare the JRI in the k -out-of- n  
system with that in the k -out-of- )1( +n  
system.  In addition, we also find the JRI in 
the k -out-of- n  system with covariance 
between any two fixed components.  
Secondly, we study the JRI in the 
series-parallel system.  We determine the 
JRI of the following three cases: (i) two 
components in the same series subsystem of 
the same series-parallel subsystem; (ii) two 
components in different series subsystems of 
the same series-parallel system; (iii) two 
components in different series-parallel 
subsystems.  Finally, we study the JRI in 
the consecutive 2-out-of- n  system, which is 
not a symmetric system.  We present 
several results of the JRI of pairs of 
components.  It is surprising that the JRI of 
the first and the j th components is equal to 
that of the first and the )4( +− jn th 
components. 
 
2.  Joint Reliability Importance of 
k-out-of-n Systems 
 
In this section, we study the joint 
reliability importance of the k -out-of- n  
system with identical and independent 
distributed (IID) components.  A k -out-of- 
n  system is a system that works if there are 
at least k  functioning components among 
n  components.  Hong et al. stated the 
definition of JRI for the IID model.  They 
derived the JRI and then characterized the 
sign of JRI of the k -out-of- n  system with 
IID components as follows [9].

3.  Joint Reliability Importance of 
Series-Parallel Systems  
 
In this section, we study the joint 
reliability importance of the series-parallel 
system with identical and independent 
distributed (IID) components.  Let the 
series-parallel system S  have k  
subsystems connected in parallel where each 
subsystem has in  IID components 
connected in series.  See Figure 3 for 
example.  In the following, we present the 
joint reliability importance (JRI) of the 
series-parallel system. 
Theorem 3.1.  The reliability of the 
series-parallel system is ∏ −−=

Theorem 3.2.  Consider a single 
series-parallel system.  The joint reliability 
importance of the series-parallel system is as 
follows.

Next, we consider a system with two 
series-parallel subsystems, where the first 
one is composed of r  series subsystems 
each with in  components, and the other one 
is composed of s  series subsystems each 
with tm  components. Figure 3.2 shows a 
system with two series-parallel subsystems.

series-parallel subsystems is =R
