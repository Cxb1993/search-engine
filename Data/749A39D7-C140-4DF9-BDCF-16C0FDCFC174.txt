1. Introduction 
In the completion the sequencing of the human genome [1, 2], scientists need to develop 
new research tools to analyze a vast array of biological information. The growing availability of 
the genome sequence data is opening up the possibility of developing a comprehensive 
understanding of complex cellular processes. In traditional approaches, cellular parameters are 
represented by populations. They are averages and cannot exactly represent individual cells. 
Additionally, heterogeneity cannot be evaluated in bulk cultures. Multiple parameters must be 
measured in real time in single living cells to correlate cellular events with genomic information 
and thus understand complex cellular processes.  
For single cell analysis, cell impedance analysis [3-5] has developed rapidly and has become 
an effective method of biological measurement. The temperature, electric conductivity and 
mobility of a cell can influence its impedance characteristics directly or indirectly so the cell 
impedance characteristic can be used to understand biological characteristic behavior. 
Measurements on single cells also provide more accurate and in-depth information about 
electrical properties than do those of pathological tissues. Single-cell impedance also can be 
applied to study the effect of pharmaceutical compounds [6], the effect of viral and bacterial 
infections [7-10], and environmental parameters [11], toxicity [12] and other factors. 
Microsensors are one of the preferred technologies that are adopted to characterize cells 
according to their electrical properties in the frequency domain for single cell sensing. Recent 
developments in miniaturized impedance measurement systems enabled the impedance of cells to 
be measured [13-16]. Impedance studies of cells have demonstrated that the measurement of 
dielectric properties can reveal the pathological status of the cell. Bio-impedance analysis detects 
the effects of multiple physiological parameters on gene behavior. In the production of microscale 
sensors and actuators, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) is an enabling technology that 
is used in semiconductor fabrication [17, 18], and involves the integration of mechanical 
elements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a common silicon substrate using 
microfabrication technology. Such microsystems have the potential to lower the cost, increase the 
accuracy, and reduce the labor involved in performing assays, as compared to macroscale systems. 
Therefore, the development of MEMS modules for characterizing single cells is essential to 
measuring multiple parameters in small colonies of living cells in real time.   
Stable environments must be maintained for cells of interest to probe cellular functions at 
the single cell level. Simultaneously, the environment must also be designed to enable effective 
determination of multiple parameters of cells in real time as functions of environmental changes. 
In recent years, the general methods used to capture cells have been mechanical trapping, electric 
trapping and optical tweezers. Mechanical trapping employs MEMS technology and pressure 
driving to cause fluids to flow through the microchannel. It separates cells of various cell 
exteriority and sizes [19, 20] or utilizes silicon pillars to catch biological particles [21]. Electric

3. Theory 
An equivalent circuit model, including the cell, dielectric capacitance and electrodes is 
established. The system can be modeled electrically as cell impedance Zcell in parallel with a 
dielectric capacitance Cdi and both in series with a pair of electrodes resistor Re, as presented in 
Fig. 2. The model is operated at low frequency between 1 and 100 kHz. Zcell comprises both cell 
membrane Cc and cytoplasm Rc. Cdi represents a capacitance that has contributions from all of the 
materials that are between two electrodes, including the solution. The impedance Zcell is 
1c cR j Cω+ , whereω  is the angular frequency of the electrical single. The overall impedance of 
the system can be written as

4. Simulation 
A commercial software package, CFD-ACE+ (CFD Research Corporation), was used to 
produce a model to study the flow of the channel. The code has unique capabilities for 
multiphysics, multiscale and coupled simulations of fluid, thermal, chemical, biological, 
electrical and mechanical phenomena for real-world applications.  The program provided an 
integrated geometry and grid generation module, a graphical user interface for preparing the 
model, a computational solver for performing the simulation, and an interactive visualization 
program. These were used to analyze the simulation results. 
Figure 3 presents the velocity field around the micro pillars at a pressure difference of 100 
Pa between the inlet and the outlet of the channel. This numerical model was two-dimensional 
and incorporated a fluid module. The width and length of the model were 200 μm and 100 μm, 
respectively, and the size of three micro pillars was 10 μm x 10 μm. The maximum velocity of the 
fluid near the region of the three micro pillars was about 0.26 m/s. The probability of cell capture 
was calculated from the percentage of the channel width where the velocity vectors flow into the 
trap. According to the velocity field, the probability of cell capture by three micro pillars was 
around 10%. 
  
0.8V because Zcell became significant.  
The equivalent circuit model of the system including Cc and Rc, Cdi and Re shown in Fig. 2 
was fitted to the experimental results. The values Re=3×104 Ω and Cdi=5×10-12 F were extracted 
by curve fitting for the HeLa cell and held fixed when the model was fitted to all other samples. 
Figure 8 plots simulated (solid line) and measured (circles) system impedance magnitude and 
phase response at 0.1V, with parameters Rc=6×107 Ω, Cc=2.5×10-12 F, Re=3×104 kΩ and 
Cdi=5×10-12 F. Table 1 presents the values of Cc and Rc obtained from the fits to all the samples. 
Since increasing the operating voltage may open ionic channels, Rc declines and Cc increases. 
Yao et al. [28] demonstrate that the approximate capacitance of malignant tumor cell membrane 
is 6.95×10-9 F. It is higher than that obtained in this study because they use higher operation 
voltage (100 V). According to the developed model, it can be seen that the higher operation 
voltage results in higher cell capacitance. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This study presents a microfluidic device that can perform physical capture and measure 
impedance by impedance spectroscopy at the single cell level.  This microfluidic device 
comprises a PDMS channel with micro pillars and a glass substrate with electrodes. The 
experiments reveal that the single HeLa cell is successfully captured by the micro pillars. Its 
impedance is measured by impedance spectroscopy at frequencies of between 1 and 100 kHz. 
The commercial software CFD-ACE+ is adopted to study the flow of the microstructures in the 
channel; the probability of cell capture by three micro pillars is about 10%. Additionally, an 
equivalent circuit model, incorporating the cell, dielectric capacitance and electrodes, is 
established. The circuit can be modeled electrically as Zcell in parallel with Cdi and both in series 
with a pair of Re. The equivalent circuit model fits the experimental results closely at various 
operating voltages. The system parameters can be obtained from the curving fitting of all samples. 
According to the experimental results for HeLa cell and isotonic solution, the magnitude of the 
HeLa cell is smaller than magnitude of isotonic solution about 1~2 orders at 0.1V and 0.5V 
because this cell is more conductive than isotonic solution. The results of the HeLa cell 
experiments show that the magnitude of the HeLa cell declines as the frequency increases at all 
operation voltages because the HeLa cell is capacitive. Furthermore, increasing the operating 
voltage reduces the magnitude of the HeLa cell impedance because a strong electric filed may 
increase the exchange of ions between cytoplasm and isotonic solution. Below the operating 
voltage of 0.9V, the system impedance responds like a parallel circuit below 30 kHz and like a 
series circuit between 30 and 100 kHz. The phase of the HeLa cell impedance is characteristic of 
a series circuit when the operating voltage exceeds 0.8V because Zcell is then significant.
