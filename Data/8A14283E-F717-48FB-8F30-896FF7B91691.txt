ABSTRACT: A compact size slot antenna designed for ultra-wideband applications is proposed. 
The slot embedded into the antenna was comprised of an open-ended hemi-circular slot and a 
narrow rectangular slot. To achieve good impedance matching within the desired band of 
interest, the 50 Ω microstrip feed-line is loaded with an elliptical slot, while an extended 
substrate was protruded above the upper edge of the antenna. The experimental results such as 
return losses, radiation patterns and gain p operties are studied, and good characteristics are 
demonstrated. Typical frequency domain responses are also measured to ensure that the 
proposed antenna can provide stable signal transmission within the UWB spectrum.   
 
Key words: ultra-wideband, slot antenna, open-ended

the open-end of the feed-line. Here, the long- and short-axis of the elliptical slot are 4.7 mm and 
1.2 mm, respectively. To excite the UWB spectrum, an open-ended slot comprises of a 
hemi-circular slot and narrow rectangular slot are embedded into the radiating element. The 
radius (R) of the hemi-circular slot is 4.0 mm, while the narrow rectangular slot aligned to the 
center of the circular slot is with dimension 7.5 mm × 1.0 mm. Note that the exact size of the 
radiating element is only 25.0 mm × 13.5 mm. As for the additional 1.5 mm FR4 substrate (Es) 
extended above the upper edge of the radiating element, it plays an important role in attaining a 
desirable return loss (below the 10 dB threshold). Further investigation on this extended section is 
discussed in the Section 4. 
   
3. DESIGN METHODOLOGY 
To provide a clear guideline on the design and development process of the proposed antenna, a 
flow chart that described the design methodology of this proposed UWB antenna is illustrated in 
Figure 2. The design of the proposed antenna begins with studying the reference antenna [21] and 
all its vital parameters. The design specifications such as the return loss, bandwidth, gain, and 
radiating pattern are also defined, so that the designer could select/modify the structure of the 
proposed antenna that must satisfy the specification set for a UWB antenna. Here, an FR4 
substrate with permittivity 4.4 and thickness 1.6 is adopted so that the proposed antenna is 
comparable to the reference in [21]. The electromagnetic simulator, HFSS is used for studying 
the structure of the proposed antenna and predicting the results in terms of the design 
specifications. Furthermore, from the simulation process, it will also lead to the initial 
understanding of various vital parameters that will affect the antenna performances, which 
include the bandwidth and impedance matching along the desired band of interest (UWB).  
After determining the substrate, firstly, the hemi-circular slot and the narrow rectangular slot 
are designed because they are the main parts of the proposed antenna. The corresponding 
parameters are R, H, and d, which can be used for rough tuning and good impedance matching. 
Secondly, the intersection of the narrow rectangular slot and the elliptical ring-slot loaded to the 
open-end of the microstrip feed-line are also important parts affecting the impedance matching. 
The corresponding parameters are R2 and R3, which need to be determined for fine tuning and 
good impedance matching around upper frequencies. Finally, the extended substrate section Es 
and the location of the 50 Ω microstrip-line are adjusted as well for fine tuning and good 
impedance matching around middle frequencies. 
The vital parameters that are discovered by simulation are R, H, d, R2, R3, and Es as depicted 
in Figure 1. Each parameter has its own contribution on the impedance matching around the 
lower, middle, and/or upper operating band of the UWB spectrum. By tuning these parameters 
appropriately as illustrated in Figure 2, good impedance matching can be achieved. These tuning

bands are usually observed around the 4 GHz and 6 GHz band. To fully comprehend the role of 
the extended substrate section Es, which aids in achieving better impedance matching at the two 
aforementioned bands which are usually mismatched when certain parameters (R, H, d, R2, or R3) 
are varied, an investigation on Es is also studied and presented in Figure 8. In this figure, if the 
substrate section is absent from the proposed antenna (Es = 0 mm), an impedance mismatch will 
be incurred around the frequency band from 5 to 6.5 GHz. Although the upper frequency bands 
(6.5 to 11.0 GHz) are also affected, they are still well below the 10-dB return loss. If Es is further 
increased to 3.0 mm, it is noteworthy that the two frequency bands (around 4 and 6 GHz) are still 
well matched below 10 dB return loss. Nevertheless, to achieve compact size of 0.25 λ × 0.15 λ, 
Es is therefore chosen to be 1.5 mm. 
 
5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A prototype of the proposed UWB antenna is fabricated and experimentally studied. From the 
measured and simulated return losses as depicted in Figure 9; both results are generally in good 
agreement. As for the slight disagreement exhibited between the two results at frequency band 
around 3.0 GHz, it may be due to the inserted feeding probe and unexpected tolerance during the 
fabricating process of the proposed antenna. Nevertheless, from the measured return loss, the 
proposed antenna can cover the UWB spectrum from 3.09 GHz up to 11.0 GHz. Since the 
proposed antenna is stemmed from the design reported in [21], by comparing the physical length 
of the proposed antenna (25 × 13.5 × 1.6 mm3) with the reference antenna (30 × 13.5 × 1.6 mm3), 
whereby the extended substrate section for both antennas are not considered, it is obvious that the 
antenna size proposed here is smaller and more comparable to the reference antenna. Furthermore, 
by referring to the lower-end frequency of the UWB spectrum (approximate 3.0 GHz), the 
electrical dimension (length and width) of the proposed antenna can be calculated as 0.25 λ × 
0.15 λ (including Es).   
To obtain the radiation patterns of the proposed antenna, an anechoic chamber similar to the 
one mentioned in [22] is used for measuring wideband antenna, and the measurement procedure 
is as according to the IEEE standard [23]. The normalized radiation patterns of the proposed 
antenna measured across the three principal planes (x-z, y-z, and x-y planes) at 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 
GHz are presented in Figures 10, 11, and 12, respectively. Near omni-directional patterns are 
observed in the azimuth plane (x-y plane) of both 4 and 6 GHz bands. Figure 13 shows the 
measured and simulated peak gain variation of the proposed antenna. Both results are fairly 
matched to each other. In this figure, an inclining gain between 2.2 dBi and 4.4 dBi is observed 
with increasing frequency, except at around the frequency band above 10.0 GHz. This 
phenomenon may be due to the increasing losses (or distortion) generated within the measuring 
system at such frequency (larger than 10 GHz), or due to a decrease in antenna’s efficiency at the

國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                     日期 100 年 10 月 30 日 
一、參加會議經過 
今年的海峽兩岸四地無線電研討會在中國哈爾濱工業大學舉行，為期5天(7月26日
至7月30日)。本研討為口頭報告方式發表論文，各國專家學者互相交流認識，討論彼此
的研究領域及交換心得。由於本人發表時間為7月28日上午10:50~11:05，因此7月26日
從桃園機場搭機經北京轉機至哈爾濱，7月26日先在會場觀摩與了解還環境，7月28日下
午為本人口頭報告方式發表時間。發表期間有幾位學者對本篇論文有興趣，皆能詳細與
他們交換心得。7月31日下午從哈爾濱搭機經北京轉機返回台灣。 
 
二、與會心得 
此次研討會是本人第 1 次參與海峽兩岸四地無線電研討會，透過本研討會可與各國
學者交換心得，互相觀摩學習。在口頭報告方面，許多學者花費心思，相當精緻，確實
有改善空間。在其他領域的學術論文發表會上，雖然與自己研究方向較不相關，但聽取
了研究先進們所發表的論文，不但可以增廣見聞，還可以提起本人在其他領域上的興
