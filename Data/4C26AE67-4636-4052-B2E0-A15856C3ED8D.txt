英文摘要 
In this project, a cascade integral sliding mode control for a water tank level control 
system was proposed to realize level position regulating and tracking control. The key 
feature of this control scheme is use of cascade back-step design method for the 
cascade nonlinear water tank level system to improve the control performances. The 
validity of the proposed control scheme is verified through practical testing on an 
experimental tank level system device. In the cases of step, multi step, and sinusoidal 
level position command inputs, the test results show that the proposed control scheme 
is capable of improving the tracking precision. 
Keywords: cascade integral sliding mode control, water tank level control system, 
back step. 
 
1. Introduction. Owing to the requirement of industrial manufacturing processes, the 
liquid tank level control system is applied to many processing fields. For example, the 
raw materials stock of chemical works[1], the mixture raw materials of lithification 
process[1], the mould casting process[2,3], and the steam generator of nuclear power 
plants[4,5] etc., involve liquid level control to a certain extent. Conventionally, the 
linear PID control schemes are employed to have control of the liquid level for a 
number of liquid tank systems. However, as regards the high-precision control, it is 
insufficient to use linear PID controllers. Typically, there are some challenges in the 
design of liquid tank level control systems such as system parameter variations, and

R ρ=  is the fluid resistance [10]. Consider the liquid-level 
system shown in Fig. 2, the tank acts as a fluid capacitor where fluid enters by pump 
motor and fluid leaves the tank across a pipe resistance. According to mass flow rate 
balance [11, 12],

where q  is the rate of liquid storage in the tank, miq  is the flow rate of water into

area of tank, and h  is the height of liquid inside the tank, Eq.(2) can be written as

where m  is the liquid mass of storage in the tank and ρ  is the mass density. Since 
the electrical control response time of the pump is shorter than the water flow into the 
tank, theflow rate miq  of water flow into the tank can be considered as proportional 
to the control input, u , i.e. 
 kuqmi = ,  (4) 
3. Design of a Cascade Sliding Mode Control. There are many nonlinear plants, which 
are composed of a moving mechanical part and an electrical driving part. These plants 
can usually be described by the following equations:

where u , R∈y , are the input and output, respectively; RR →nmm gf :,  , RRR →× pnaa gf :,  , 
RR →:F  are smooth functions. We assume that the driving force, )(ζF , is  
 2221 )( ζαζζζα ≤≤ F          (11) 
For convenience, we will express )(ζF  as  
  )()( ζρζζ FF Δ+=     (12) 
where ζσζ ≤Δ )(F [6],[7]. Moreover, the function mf and af  are assumed the 
following forms: )()(ˆ)( XXX mmm fff Δ+=  and ),(),(ˆ),( ζXζXζX aaa fff Δ+= , respectively; mfˆ , afˆ  
are nominal parts and mfΔ , afΔ  are uncertain parts. The uncertainties of the system were

The object is to design a control law such that the output y  will approximately track 
a given signal ay , i.e., ,0)(lim =∞→ tet  where

5. Conclusion. By introducing like a back step design method, we have successfully 
presented a cascade integral sliding mode control scheme to effectively improve the 
tracking performance. With this control law, we have shown that the feasibility of 
controller for the control of the cascade nonlinear WTLCS, as compared with the 
sliding mode control for the simplify model of WTLCS. Through the experimental 
testing, the results show that the proposed approach provides high precision level 
control as well as transient response of a nonlinear WTLCS. From the above 
discussions, three points should be highlighted. 
(1) We have shown that the tracking performance of the newly developed sliding 
mode control seems to be promising in the application of liquid tank level control 
problems. 
(2) The experimental results obtained through pratical testing on an experimental 
setup, PC-based WTLCS, strongly suggest that the proposed approach provides 
high-precision tracking with regard to the multi-level command inputs and good 
robustness against the external disturbances and parameter variations. 
(3) By a comparison study on WTLCS, we have shown that the performance of the 
proposed sliding mode control is much better than those of the linear PID control, the 
nonlinear fuzzy control, and conventional sliding mode control.
