devices or smart phone, a single device functions as a phone, 
camera, personal entertainment console, GPS, PDA, and application 
platform) 的迅速而普遍的被人們接受並成為生活中不可或缺的
一部份。在以資訊為基礎的工業型態下，每個人都想要隨時隨
地的維持信息的更新與取得，因此大量的增加了每個人所需要
的傳輸頻寬。為了因應此發展，最好的解決方法之一就是使用
光纖當作傳輸媒介。以光纖為主幹的通訊系統不但可以有效的
舒緩目前無線通訊頻寬不足的窘境，也是目前所知最能滿足未
來頻寬要求的傳輸媒介。因此整合光纖到家 (fiber-to-the-home, 
FTTH提供 triple-play services, voice, video and internet) 以及
radio-over-fiber (ROF, 提供無線的語音以及網路服務) 的混成光
纖擷取網路架構 (hybrid optical access network) 已經逐漸被大家
所認可是最具有經濟效益的網路架構。混成光纖擷取網路系統
可同時傳輸基頻與高頻訊號，提供了一高品質的傳輸媒介 (低
損耗、低干擾) 與多元與豐富的服務內容。如果 FTTH和 ROF
各自需要鋪設自己的光纖網路，則不但耗費時間、造成重複資
本投資 (capital expenditure, CAPEX)，也將大量增加營運與維護
的資本支出 (operating expenditure, OPEX)。因此若能整合
FTTH與 radio-over-fiber兩個系統，不但能降低成本、加速網
路建置的時效，同時有能有效的降低營運成本、減低支出，進
而大大的增加光纖網路的附加價值。在傳統的基頻 (base-band, 
on-off keying) 光通信中，光是很難攜帶向量信號 (eg. QAM, 
MPSK)，但是在無線通信中為了增加頻帶效率 (spectral 
efficiency)，向量信號是非常重要的基本要求，因此在傳統的網
路中，必須要在基地台將光通信的信號格式轉成無線通信的信
號格式，這不但增加了成本的支出也使的傳輸的效率降低。因
此在本計畫中我們將發展以目前無線通信最受重視的傳輸方式
QAM-OFDM (quadrature amplitude modulation, orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing) 將其轉載在光的微波信號頻段來
傳輸，以實現提供 quad-play services (voice, video, internet and 
wireless) 的目標。我們也將同時發展在 60-GHz 頻段的戶內超
高傳輸量 (>4 Gb/s) 網路。此一網路的目標就是希望達成在用戶
家庭內的高速網路來傳輸 HDTV 的信號。自 2001年美國聯邦
通訊委員會 (federal communications commission，FCC) 撤銷從
57到 64 GHz中間 7-GHz的連續無線通訊頻段，業界和學術界
便投入大量心力去研究這具有無限前景的無線技術。消費電子
產業的六大供應商 LG、松下、NEC、三星電子、Sony以及東
芝等公司在 2006年底組成的Wireless-HD小組來共同制定 60-
GHz無線技術規格 (http://www.wirelesshd.org/)。60-GHz所能使
用的頻帶寬高達 7-GHz，直接影響到的資料傳輸率也提升許
division-multiplexer (WDM) RoF systems. In this project, a novel 
frequency quadrupling approach that can generate a carrier 
suppressed optical mm-wave signal up to 160-GHz using a single 
integrated MZM and inexpensive electronic components with a 
frequency range of 40-GHz will be demonstrated.

1. Introduction 
With the exponentially increasing of customer needs for broadband services, passive optical 
network (PON) is considered to be the most promising candidate that can economically 
provide high bandwidth to end-users [1]. Recently, there have been growing interests in the 
new type of optically amplified large-split long-reach PON (LR-PON) [2–6]. Integrated the 
access network with the metro network within the 100-km target range, LR-PON claims to 
considerably reduce the capital and operational expenditures by increasing the coverage of the 
central office and consolidating the O/E/O conversion interfaces inside the existing networks. 
Besides, LR-PONs can simplify the network hierarchies and thus reduce the network latency, 
which is very important for the real-time broadband services. 
To realize next generation LR-PON systems, several multiplexing schemes are viable 
candidates to support more ONUs with higher data rate, such as time-division multiplexing 
(TDM), orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and wavelength-division 
multiplexing (WDM). In particular, OFDM LR-PON, which boasts to offer high spectral 
efficiency and flexible bandwidth allocation, has attracted a lot of attention recently [7]. Both 
TDM and OFDM LR-PONs can easily support numerous ONUs by using an optical splitter 
with large splitting ratio and can broadcast the aggregated data to all ONUs on a single 
wavelength, thus have the benefit of simple wavelength management [6]. However, the 
aggregated data rate on a single wavelength will be very high (40 Gbps or higher), and each 
ONU has to process very high-speed aggregated data in order to receive and transmit a small 
portion of data (e.g. <1/128) [6]. In [7], a 108-Gbps OFDM PON over single wavelength is 
demonstrated employing two Mach-Zehnder modulators, polarization multiplexing and two 
receivers. For cost-sensitive ONUs, the proposed scheme will be too complicated and 
expensive to be a practical solution in the near future. An alternative solution is WDM LR-
PON, where each ONU can be assigned a wavelength, thus ONUs doesn’t have to process the 
aggregated data and the speed requirement of each transceiver can be considerably lower. 
Besides, instead of using a large-splitting-ratio optical splitter, WDM LR-PON can use a 
wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer (waveguide grating router, WGR), and the loss of 
WGR is much lower and insensitive to wavelength number. Unfortunately, even though the 
speed requirement of each transceiver is lower in a WDM system, numerous color 
transmitters are costly and undesired. To preserve the colorless upstream architecture, an 
RSOA (reflective semiconductor optical amplifier) is employed for upstream service [8,9]. 
Currently, employing RSOAs are still facing some technical challenges such as limited 
bandwidth, ASE noise, Rayleigh backscattering needed to be overcome. Besides, the systems 
fail to allocate bandwidth flexibly among ONUs of different wavelengths [4]. In particular, 
since a LR-PON is needed to be coexisted with the current PONs, such as 10-Gbps PON (XG-
PON) and Gigabit PON (G-PON). As shown in Fig. 1 [10], excluding guard bands, the 
available enhancement bands provide very limited bandwidth at C-band for future LR-PONs. 
For the reasons stated above, a more practical solution will be a hybrid WDM/OFDM LR-

to each of 32 ONUs. Moreover, the system could simply be upgraded to support 128 ONUs 
by using only four wavelengths for each direction (downstream and upstream). Thus, 
compared with the previous proposals of LR-PONs, our proposed 33-Gbps hybrid 
WDM/OFDM LR-PON optimizes the trade-off between the number of wavelength channels 
[2–6,8,9,12] and the cost of transceivers [7], based on cost-effective 10-GHz EML and PIN 
based IMDD scheme.

Fig. 2. Proposed feasible architecture for a cost-effective LR-PON. 
Based on the trade-off between wavelength channel number and transceiver cost and the 
requirements of next-generation PON (NG-PON) discussed in [18], some criteria have been 
contemplated for a feasible LR-PON. Though some of the proposed numbers are open to 
discussion and may change with the development of technologies, these are the important 
issues that need to be addressed prudently: (a) Sustainable symmetric data rate of each ONU 
is 1 Gbps for supporting future broadband multimedia services [18]; (b) Power splitting ratio 
(N) is 32 for a reasonable optical loss budget and the aggregated data rate on a single 
wavelength is 32≥  Gbps; (c) Supporting ONU number is 128≥ for sharing the capital and 
operational expenditures; (d) Using WDM technology to stack four (W = 4) 32-Gbps PON, 
thus 128 ( 128N W× = ) ONUs can be achieved by four wavelengths for each direction, and 
(e) Cost effective transceiver design is achieved by a 10-GHz IMDD scheme. Notably, four 
wavelengths for each direction (downstream and upstream) are recommended due to very 
limited wavelength resources, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, the proposed architecture of a LR-
PON and the corresponding parameters of the above criteria are illustrated in Fig. 2, and the 
proposed LR-PON can meet the requirements of NG-PON [18] by using a cost-effect and 
feasible architecture. Wavelength management of four channels is not technique challenging, 
but the most crucial part turns out to be achieving the expected data rate of >32 Gbps via a 
cost-effective transceiver. In particular, while the IMDD scheme is preferred, an optical 
OFDM signal is generated in the form of DSB. Namely, an electrical OFDM subcarrier will 
be translated into two conjugated optical subcarriers on both sides of an optical carrier. After 
transmission in fiber link, however, the residual dispersion destroys their conjugated property 
and results in a well-known power fading. Moreover, since an optical signal modulated by a 
DML or an EML is chirped, the additional phase modulation also weakens the conjugated 
property between subcarriers. Accordingly, both frequency chirp and fiber dispersion will 
affect the received power. Considering small-signal approximation, the received power, Pr, of 
an OFDM subcarrier [17,19,20]

without the requirement of high-speed (>10 GHz) electronics. Considering 10-GHz 
transceivers, the total bandwidth of passbands within 10 GHz is exhibited in Fig. 4(b). The 
total bandwidth increases after the distance of ~40 km due to the joining of the 2nd passband, 
but it decreases after ~80-km transmission owing to the appearance of the 2nd forbidden band. 
Thus, fully utilizing all the available passbands and properly allocating OFDM subcarriers can 
overcome the difficulty of very limited bandwidth after transmission. The following section 
will present the multi-band EAM-based transmission by allocating OFDM subcarriers in 
different passbands based on the analysis results shown in Fig. 4. Since the total bandwidth is 
not monotonously decreasing as transmission distance is increasing, in additional to 100-km 
transmission, the capacities of 20-km, 40-km, 60-km, and 80-km transmissions are also 
investigated to verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme over PONs of various sizes.

except that the transmission distances are different. A point-to-point transmission is adopted 
to emulate a long-reach OFDM-PON, since the loss of a remote node in PONs can be 
compensated by an optical amplifier. The baseband electrical OFDM signal is generated by an 
arbitrary waveform generator (AWG, Tektronix® AWG7122) using Matlab® programs. The 
signal processing of the OFDM transmitter consists of serial-to-parallel conversion, QAM 
symbol encoding, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, and 
digital-to-analog conversion (DAC). The sampling rate and DAC resolution of the AWG are 
12 GS/s and 8 bits, respectively. In order to utilize the bandwidth of both passbands as shown 
in Figs. 3 and 4, the two-band electrical OFDM signal is composed of two streams of OFDM 
signals with the FFT size of 512 generated owing to the limited AWG bandwidth of only 7.5 
GHz. Nevertheless, since the channel number of the AWG is only 2, the signal of the 2nd 
band is emulated by directly up-converting the signal from the channel 2 of the AWG, instead 
of independent I- and Q-channels. 
With the detailed parameters of the multi-band OFDM at different transmission distances 
given at Table 1 at the end of this section, and to avoid similar scenario being repeated, the 
following paragraphs only describe the parameters of the 40-km and 100-km transmissions, 
because the transmission conditions of these two cases are severer than the others. That is, as 
shown in Fig. 4 (b), the 40-km SMF transmission has only one passband and the available 
bandwidth is the minimum, while the 100-km SMF transmission has the longest distance in

optical power budget among 20–100-km LR-PONs. The optical power following the EDFA as 
shown in Fig. 5 is about 16.5 dBm, thus the corresponding optical power budget of 100-km 
LR-PON is 26 dB, which can support the optical power loss of the following 50-km SMF and 
the optical splitter with 32 splitting ratio. Finally, Table 1 collates all the experimental results 
of 20-km, 40-km, 60-km, 80-km and 100-km SMF transmissions, including the multi-band 
OFDM subcarrier allocations, data rates, received power penalties, receiver sensitivities and 
power budgets. Both the cases of 20-km and 40-km transmissions adopt only one passband, 
while the others have two passbands. The minimum data rate of 33.04 Gbps is obtained after 
40-km SMF, and the maximum of 40 Gbps is demonstrated after 20-km SMF. Moreover, the 
received power penalties and the receiver sensitivities of the 40-km and 100-km systems are 
worse than the others, since the available bandwidth is the minimum after 40-km SMF and the 
100-km system suffers from the severest SSII.

4. Conclusion 
To summarize, this work has experimentally demonstrated optical DSB-OFDM transmission 
over 20–100-km SMF links using a cost-effective 10-GHz EAM and a 10-GHz PIN. Although 
the frequency responses of the 20–100-km EAM-based transmission systems are seriously 
impaired by power fading, this work efficiently and dynamically allocates different 
modulation levels and power levels of OFDM subcarriers in different bands to cope with 
uneven frequency responses and to avoid serious power fading. The experimental results show 
the superior performance of at least 33 Gbps over 20–100-km transmissions and the record 
data rate of 34.78 Gbps after 100-km SMF based on a 10-GHz EAM-based IMDD scheme.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a superior performance of 
2.1-Tb/s·km OFDM signal transmission over 100-km long-reach PONs. 
While the bandwidth of a 100-km SMF transmission system is limited to 4.3 
GHz due to positive chirp, we successfully achieve spectrally-efficient 
21-Gb/s signaling by using a cost-effective and low-chirp EAM, and 
adopting the 128-QAM format and adaptive subcarrier pre-emphasis.

While   of a commercial DFB laser is generally larger than 6, the corresponding bandwidth 
after 100-km SMF, as shown in Fig. 1, is less than about 1.1 GHz. This fact implies that a very 
high order QAM format must be employed to transmit signals at the data rate of 10 Gbps or 
beyond. Hence, an EML (or EAM) with 1   is more suitable for a cost-efficient long-reach 
OFDM-PON.

Via a network analyzer, we display in Fig. 2 the measured frequency responses of an 
EAM-based transmission system over 100-km SMF under different bias voltages. Notably, the 
first null point of the frequency response, 
nullf , can be used to estimate the bias-dependent

From Fig. 2, we observe the system bandwidth strongly depends on the bias voltage, and the 
bandwidth can be even larger than that of a chirp-free system of which 
nullf  is about 6.1 GHz, 
when bias voltage is smaller than ~ 1.5  V. Since the bandwidth is not the only concern to the 
signal performance, in the following section, we present our EAM-based OFDM transmission 
system to evaluate the transmission performance.

Fig. 4. (a) Optical power loss and (b) chirp parameter and 3-dB bandwidth at 100-km SMF of the 
EAM as functions of bias voltage. 
In Figs. 4(a) and (b), we display the amplitude and phase characteristics of the EAM, 
respectively, and the linear electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversion region is between 1.1  V 
and 0.5  V. Within this region, the measured chirp parameter ranges from 0.3 to 1.2, and the 
corresponding transmission bandwidth at 100-km SMF is from 3.5 GHz to 2.4 GHz. 
Accordingly, the transmission bandwidth at 100-km SMF could be a critical issue for our 
3-GSymbol/s signal, when the electrical signal is operated in this linear E/O conversion region. 
Furthermore, to evaluate the signal performance, Figs. 5(a)-(c) depict the measured SNR of 
every OFDM subcarrier with and without transmissions, and we use the different profiles of 
subcarrier power pre-emphasis which are illustrated in Fig. 5(d). While both the bias voltage 
and the subcarrier pre-emphasis are optimized at back-to-back, the operational bias voltage is 
0.8  V, which is about the center of the linear E/O conversion region. However, as shown in 
Fig. 5(a), after 100-km SMF transmission, the subcarriers at high frequency suffer severe SNR 
penalty and fail to achieve the FEC threshold (BER 33.8 10   and redundancy ratio of 7%) 
[16]. This implies a trade-off problem between bandwidth and E/O conversion linearity. For 
example, a bias voltage of 0.8   V yields wider transmission bandwidth, however, at the 
expense of lower conversion linearity. Therefore, the bias voltage should be slightly reduced to 
obtain wider bandwidth and better transmission performance after SMF transmission. In Fig. 
5(b), subcarrier power pre-emphasis is optimized according to the SNR at 50-km SMF, and the 
bias voltage is slightly down shifted to 0.84  V. Furthermore, by optimizing the subcarrier 
power pre-emphasis at 100 km and reducing the bias voltage to 0.93  V, we show the 
measured SNR in Fig. 5(c) which demonstrates that the subcarriers at high frequency suffer less 
SNR penalty compared to that in Fig. 5(a), and all the subcarriers achieve the FEC threshold 
within 100-km transmission. Moreover, we plot in Fig. 6 the BER performance of the 
EAM-based OFDM signal, with the corresponding constellations shown in the insets of the 
figure. Each BER curve is adaptively optimized at a specific transmission distance, and the 
transmission penalty over 100-km at the FEC threshold is as low as ~1 dB.

Abstract—In this letter, we propose a novel passive optical
network (PON) architecture supporting radio-over-fiber signals
and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
PON signals. The architecture transports upstream multiple
remote antenna’s wireless signals using only one upstream
wavelength. In addition, the windowed-orthogonal frequency-di-
vision-multiplexing technique is employed to mitigate interference
during the integration process. Experimental results shows that
10-Gb/s OFDMA and three radio-frequency signals at 2.1 GHz
are successfully transmitted over 20-km single-mode fiber in a
32-optical-network-unit PON.

I. INTRODUCTION
B ROADBAND wireless access systems have been success-fully exploited to provide ubiquitous high-speed connec-
tivity to end users. Next-generation passive optical networks
(PONs) are thus expected to seamlessly transport wireless sig-
nals [1] to reduce the deploying cost while taking advantage of
huge capacity of optical fiber. However, supporting multiple re-
mote antenna ports in one trunk fiber gives rise to the optical
beat interference (OBI) problem. To alleviate the problem, the
approaches [2] exploit either wavelength-division-multiplexing
(WDM)–PON or multiple upstream lasers at specially selected
widely apart wavelengths, which are relatively expensive and
impractical.
In this letter, we propose a new orthogonal frequency-divi-
sion multiple access (OFDMA)-PON architecture without using
WDM lasers. The architecture enables integration of broadband
transport and wireless radio-frequency (RF) signals from mul-
tiple remote antennas. The integration unfortunately gives rise

to the OFDMA signal interference to RF signals despite that
several OFDMA subcarriers around the radio band are disabled.
In this letter, we adopt a windowing technique at the OFDMA
transmitter to mitigate the interference. Experimental results
demonstrate that 10-Gb/s OFDMA signals and three RF sig-
nals at 2.1 GHz are successfully transmitted over 20-km single-
mode fiber (SMF) in the new PON with 32 optical network units
(ONUs).
II. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
The proposed OFDMA-PON [3], [4] (see Fig. 1) connects
multiple ONUs to the optical line terminal (OLT) through
an optical distribution node (ODD). The ODD is composed
of one short section of drop fiber for each ONU and a set of
optical circulators to direct signals among ONUs and OLT. The
OFDMA-PON uses two wavelengths, and , to convey
downstream and upstream data, respectively. To send data
downstream, the splitter in ODD generates multiple signal
copies, each of which passes a circulator before reaching the
destined ONU.
For upstream data, ONU-1 first sends its upstream data and
control information to ONU-2 through circulators. Upon having
received data and control information on , the next ONU de-
termines the subcarrier on which its upstream data is carried,
and regenerates the OFDMA signal and sends it to the next ONU
down the line. Finally, at ONU- , the upstream wavelength is
passed to OLT through the ODD. Moreover, the OFDMA-PON
includes a 1-by-2 optical switch at each ONU’s (upstream) to
protect from accidental blackout or shutdown of ONUs.

20-MHz WiMAX RF signal at 2100, 2160, and 2220 MHz,
which are generated by AWG2 are used for the upstream test.
The experiment consists of two parts. OFDM and RF are
first combined to drive a 3-dBm output power, 1550-nm direct
modulated laser module. For the first part (a direct link test), a
real-time scope captures the signal for offline signal demodula-
tion. Over 1 million bits are compared before and after the link
to obtain bit-error-rate (BER) results. A digital 200-MHz notch
filter at 2160 MHz is used to remove the RF signals before the
OFDM receiver. For the second part, we assess the performance
of the RF signal via an offline recirculating loop experiment.
After RF signals are extracted, a real-time scope captures and
stores a section of waveform at a 12.5-GHz sampling rate in a
file. The stored waveform is resampled to 10 GHz by a digital
signal processing (DSP) program and fed to the AWG2 for the
next hop transmission. For each hop, we load different OFDM
signals to AWG1 so that each hop’s interferences are not corre-
lated. We can thus emulate the accumulated interference to RF
signal from ONU-1 to ONU-32.
Define the power ratio (PR) as the OFDMA signal’s driving
power to the wireless signal’s, assuming the overall modulation
index is optimized in a weakly clipping condition. We show in
Fig. 6 that the RF signal’s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is dom-
inated by the PR value and received power level. Although we
intentionally zero 10 subcarriers for RF signal transmission, the
inevitable OFDM sidelobes still affect the RF signal’s quality.
The windowing method provides 0.5- to 1.3-dB improvement
on the RF signal’s SNR. The inset of Fig. 6 shows the RF spec-
trum under PR dB. We show in Fig. 7 that the receiver
sensitivity for BER , which is the error-free limit with
forward error correction (FEC), is 15.3 dBm at PR dB
and 0.5-dB penalty is observed if RF signal is increased to 0-dB
PR. Note that a better sensitivity can be achieved by using the
avalanche photodiode (APD)-based photoreceiver instead of the
PIN-based receiver in our experiment. After the 20-km fiber

transmission, the receiver sensitivity is degraded by 1.2 dB to
13.6 dBm. The fiber penalty comes from the laser diode’s
chirp effect. The OFDM constellation diagram is displayed in
the inset of Fig. 7. Given an optical received power of 13 dBm
at ONU and 15 dBm at OLT, as shown in Fig. 8, the SNR
of RF signal degrades as the node number increases due to the
interference from OFDM signal’s sidelobes and optical–elec-
trical–optical (O-E-O) conversion noise. If PR is equal to 1 dB,
the SNR of the RF signal can still be above 16 dB (quadra-
ture phase-shift keying (QPSK) error-free bound) after passing
through 32 ONUs and a 20-km SMF.
V. CONCLUSION
We have proposed an OFDMA-PON architecture that in-
tegrates 10-Gb/s OFDMA and three wireless signals using a
windowing method to reduce interference. Experimental results
show that after-coding direct-detection receiver sensitivity of
OFDMA over a 20-km fiber is 13.6 dBm. Under a PR of
1 dB and received power of 13 dBm at each ONU, the RF
signal can be relayed in a 32 ONU’s chain and recovered at
OLT successfully.

dual-electrode modulator structures) for RF OFDM signal trans-
mission [13]–[15]. However, it is imperative that the employed
RoF links are as simple as possible to reduce cost, while pro-
viding the needed performance. This is especially true for cer-
tain applications such as in-building systems, where certain per-
formance attributes offered by complex RoF systems are not
even required. For example, fiber spans in most in-building ap-
plications are typically less than 300 m. Therefore, in-building
RoF systems for 60 GHz do not need the fiber chromatic disper-
sion tolerance for tens of kilometers that complex systems boast
of.
In this paper, we propose a simple RoF system architecture
for transporting and generating wideband OFDM signals at
60 GHz and investigate its performance theoretically and
experimentally. The RoF system uses only one single-elec-
trode Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) having no more than
35.5-GHz bandwidth. We experimentally demonstrate the suc-
cessful use of the simple RoF system to deliver a 13.875-Gb/s
wireless signal at 60 GHz. The OFDM signal occupied the
full 7-GHz spectrum at the 60-GHz band and used QPSK
modulation. Remote frequency upconversion from the IF to 60
GHz was achieved by employing a system configuration that
used a 35.5-GHz local oscillator (LO) signal, which was trans-
ported alongside the OFDM signal. This enabled high-quality
signal transmission over extended fiber lengths exceeding 3
km without any fiber dispersion compensation. The RoF link
included a wireless transmission distance of 3 m.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
concept of the proposed system and the two main design is-
sues of the RoF link, namely RF fading and beat noise inter-
ference. Section III presents in detailed the theoretical basis of
the proposed RoF system using a theoretical model and VPI
WDM-TransmissionMaker simulation platform. Section IV de-
scribes the experimental approach and discusses the results ob-
tained from system experiments employing the design criteria
from Section III. Finally, Section V reviews the main conclu-
sion of the paper.
II. CONCEPT OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
Fig. 2 schematically depicts the concept of the proposed RoF
system. The MZM driving signal consists of an OFDM signal
at a subcarrier frequency of and a sinusoidal LO signal with
a frequency of , as indicated in Fig. 2(insets i–iii). The fre-
quency of the LO signal is half the desired mm-wave fre-
quency of operation. To achieve the double sideband (DSB) with
carrier suppression modulation scheme, the MZM is biased at
the null point to suppress the optical carrier. Fig. 2(inset iv)
shows the generated optical OFDM and LO spectrum that has
two upper wavelength sidebands (USB1, USB2) and two lower
wavelength sidebands (LSB1, LSB2) with carrier suppression
at the output of the MZM. After square-law photo detection, the
generated photocurrent can be written as
(1)
Expanding the aforementioned equation produces the following
terms:
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
The beating terms of and gen-
erate the desired OFDM-modulated electrical signals at the sum
frequency . The beating terms of and
generate electrical OFDM signals at the fre-
quency difference , which are well below the desired
mm-wave frequency band and are filtered off prior to wireless
transmission. Notably, a frequency multiplication factor of two
(2) can be achieved by properly choosing frequencies and
. This reduces the bandwidth requirements of the RoF trans-
mitter allowing for the use of low-frequency electrical and op-
tical components, including the MZM ( GHz), which are
readily available and have very good performance (e.g., flat fre-
quency response).
In this paper, the target sum frequency is 60 GHz. Two main
issues will be crucial to the system performance and will be
explained in details in following sections. First, the RF fading
issue, as shown in (12), comes from the interaction between the
two copies of the desired signals, which are generated at the
photodiode, namely, and , re-
spectively. After fiber transmission, the relative phase between
the two generated RF signals will change with transmitted dis-
tance owing to the slight difference in the propagation speeds of
the two sideband pairs induced by fiber chromatic dispersion.
As the relative phase reaches 180 , the electrical RF signal will
vanish. This is the RF fading problem. The second issue comes

single-mode fiber length for various input frequency differences (i.e.,       ).
After square-law photo detection, the photocurrent at the fre-
quency of can be expressed as
(12)
Due to fiber dispersion effect, the RF fading issue
would be observed. The RF signal power is related to
. Therefore, the RF fading issue
would become serious when the magnitude of sum frequency
and frequency difference become large.
For 60-GHz applications, the sum frequency is fixed
at 60.5 GHz, and the frequency difference will dictate
the performance of RF fading. As shown in Fig. 4, when the fre-
quency difference increases, the RF power will drop off rapidly.
For frequency differences of 10 and 40 GHz, the first deep ap-
pears following 6 and 1.6-km fiber transmission, respectively.
Not only does the smaller frequency difference result in a longer
fiber transmission distance, but it also reduces the bandwidth
requirements of the transmitter. However, the drawback of a
small frequency difference is the risk of having beat noise in-
terference. For example, if we choose 5.5 GHz as the frequency
difference and set the input frequencies at 33 GHz and
27.5 GHz, then with 7-GHz signal bandwidth, the gener-
ated signal will occupy frequencies from 24 to 31 GHz. As a re-
sult, the beat noise (i.e., ) will fill the band from 48
to 62 GHz. Since the generated OFDM signal will fill the band
from 57 to 64 GHz, the beat noise will fall in-band, as shown in
Fig. 5(a), resulting in the possibility for severe system perfor-
mance degradation. It is therefore necessary to choose proper
frequencies of the input signals in the design process in order
to avoid beat-noise induced system performance degradation.
A good example is shown in Fig. 5(b), where a frequency dif-
ference of 15.5 GHz is chosen, resulting in the beat noise occu-
pying the band from 38 to 52 GHz and causing no interference.
Therefore, there are tradeoffs between RF fading and beat
noise interference. In the following analysis, we will choose the
lowest possible frequency difference without causing any beat
noise interference. With a target signal bandwidth of 7 GHz and
center frequency of 60.5 GHz, we have

GHz (13)
Fig. 5. Beat noise interference in the proposed system and how to keep it from
degrading system performance: (a) beat signal falls inside the desired band,
(b) beat signal is far away from desired band, and (c) beat noise is just outside
the desired frequency band.
This leads to a frequency difference equal to 10.5 GHz and
input signal frequencies GHz and GHz,
respectively. In this case, the beat noise falls just outside the
desired signal band, as shown in Fig. 5(c). With the chosen
frequency parameters, we can calculate the RF fading perfor-
mance. Fig. 6(a) shows the RF power of the mm-wave signals
generated between 57 and 64 GHz plotted against frequency.
The line and circle represent theoretical results obtained using
the model in (12) and VPI WDM-TransmissionMaker simula-
tion results, respectively. It can be seen that RF fading is neg-
ligible over the whole 7-GHz spectrum for fiber spans up to
1 km. Beyond 1 km, frequencies in the lower part of the spec-
trum begin to experience increasing attenuation because they
are generated from larger frequency differences. After 4 km of
fiber transmission, the attenuation increases to 14 dB at 57 GHz
and only 3 dB at 64 GHz. Nonetheless, for typical indoor appli-
cations, 2–3 km is more than enough [17]. On the other hand,
if longer fiber transmission distances are needed, then any one
of the four optical sidebands (see Fig. 2) may be filtered off
to eliminate fading. To compare the fading length of the pro-
posed system to that of a DSB intensity-modulation direct-de-
tection (IMDD) transmission system, we plot the calculated and
the simulated (VPI WDM-TransmissionMaker) fading (signal
power) as a function of frequency. As Fig. 6(b) shows, the first
deep (total fading) at 60.5 GHz occurs after just 1 km of standard
single-mode fiber transmission in the case of the DSB IMDD
RoF system. Therefore, compared with the DSB IMDD RoF
system, the proposed system offers superior transmission per-
formance and more flexible system design.

with about 23-dBi gain and transmitted over 3-m wireless dis-
tance. After transmission over the air, the 60-GHz signal was re-
ceived by another standard gain horn antenna with dBm
received power. Therefore, the estimated path loss of the wire-
less transmission is about 77.8 dB. Then, the received signals
was amplified with an LNA ( 21 dB) and passed on to the
60-GHz downconverter. The 60-GHz downconverter consisted
of a mixer driven by a 56-GHz LO, as shown in Fig. 7. There-
fore, the received OFDM signal at 60.5 GHz was down-con-
verted to an IF of 4.5 GHz. The IF was chosen so as to maintain
the 7-GHz-wide spectrum of the received OFDM signal. The
waveforms of the downconverted OFDM signals were captured
by a real-time oscilloscope with a 40-GSample/s sampling rate
and a 3-dB bandwidth of 13 GHz for offline signal processing
and analysis. An offline Matlab digital signal processing pro-
gram was employed to demodulate the OFDM signal. The de-
modulation process included synchronization, FFT calculation,
and one-tap equalization.
B. Experimental Results and Discussions
First, we measured the performance of the system with 3-m
wireless transmission. Fig. 8 shows the bit-error-rate (BER)
curves for the received 13.875-Gb/s QPSK OFDM signal. The
BER was estimated from the measured error vector magnitude
(EVM), which is defined in [19] and [20] as
(14)
where and are the ideal and the measured con-
stellation points, respectively. For QPSK signal, the BER is re-
lated to EVM by

where is the Gaussian coerror function. Fig. 8 shows that
as fiber transmission length increased, the system sensitivity de-
creased. For back-to-back (BTB), 500-m and 1-km transmission

distances, the sensitivity was the same and equals to dBm
for a BER of . After 2 km and 3 km of fiber trans-
mission, there was a small penalty of about 1 dB and 1.5 dB,
respectively, at the BER of . However, after 5 km of
fiber transmission, the signal was severely corrupted with the
BER greater than . Fig. 9 shows the electrical spec-
trum of the down-converted OFDM signal. It can be seen from
the figure that the spectrum of the downconverted OFDM signal
was 7-GHz wide. The spectrum also shows a peak at 4.5 GHz,
which is the residual signal from the 25-GHz LO used to upcon-
vert the baseband OFDM signal to 25 GHz back at the HEU. The
progression of the chromatic-dispersion-induced fading as the
fiber transmission distance becomes larger can also be seen in
Fig. 9. It was observed that lower frequency components faded
quicker and deeper, just as predicted by the theoretical analysis
presented in Section III-B. The reason for the quicker/greater
fading at the lower frequency components is because the lower
frequency components are generated by larger frequency dif-
ferences of the two electrical input signals at the HEU. Fig. 10
shows the constellation diagrams of the demodulated OFDM
signals for different fiber transmission lengths with the wire-
less transmission distance fixed at 3 m. Very clear constella-
tion diagrams were observed until the fiber length exceeded
3 km. The total data rate of the signal was 13.875 Gb/s. The
detected optical power corresponding to the constellation dia-
grams was dBm. For the BTB case, the calculated EVM
was 17.7%. However, lower EVM values up to 16% were ob-
tained at higher received optical powers. The clean constellation
diagram in Fig. 10 confirms the excellent performance of the
RoF system in generating and transmitting high-quality wide-
band OFDM signals at 60 GHz both over optical fiber and wire-
less distance. It also shows the potential of the system for oper-
ating at a bit rate higher than 13.875 Gb/s by using modulation
formats of higher order than QPSK (e.g., 8 QAM).
To further investigate the impact of RF fading on signal
quality, the SNR of each of the 74 subcarriers making up the
OFDM signal was calculated for different fiber transmission
distances, using [19]

transmission.
discussed earlier. The difference in the sensitivities of the two
systems (with and without wireless transmission, i.e., Figs. 8
and 12, respectively) is about 1 dB. This is attributed to the pres-
ence of an extra LNA required in the wireless receiver (i.e., in
the case of the system with wireless transmission).
Given the small dispersion penalty observed for fiber spans up
to 3 km, the proposed RoF system is well suited to system ap-
plications characterized by short fiber spans, but where minimal
system complexity is critical. A good example is in-building
applications, where in most instances fiber spans of less than
300 m are sufficient. However, if required, the fading-limited
maximum fiber transmission distance may be extended by, e.g.,
using a filter such as a wavelength interleaver to remove any
one of the four sidebands (LO or OFDM) from the modulated
optical signal at the HEU prior to transmission. Filtering one
of the sidebands results in the generation of only one copy of
the desired mm-wave signal at the RAU, eliminating the possi-
bility for fading. However, the addition of the filter makes the
RoF system more complex, which as stated earlier should be
avoided in short-range RoF applications.
V. CONCLUSION
We have theoretically and experimentally investigated the
performance of a simple RoF system for transporting and gener-
ating multi-Gbps OFDM-modulated wideband wireless signals
at 60 GHz. The RoF system employs a single-electrode MZM
and uses no linearization techniques. Theoretical analysis of
the proposed system shows that by choosing appropriate input
signal frequencies, the system can achieve fiber transmission
distances exceeding 3 km without any chromatic dispersion
compensation. The theoretical analysis was confirmed by
experimental results. The RoF system was successfully used
to transport a 14-Gb/s OFDM-QPSK-modulated signal at 60
GHz over 3 km of standard single-mode fiber and 3-m wireless
distance. Experimental results showed that after 3 km of fiber
transmission there was only a small optical power penalty of 2
dB or less, at both BERs of and . Fiber links
of 3 km are sufficient for most short-range RoF applications
such as in-building systems, where low system complexity is
very critical. However, if needed, the RF fading limit of the
proposed system may be extended to much longer fiber spans
by filtering.

Abstract—The increasing demand for wireless video-based
interactive and multimedia data services explains why 60-GHz
millimeter-wave wireless system is a promising candidate to pro-
vide multi-gigabit-per-second wireless services. While attempting
to generate and transmit 60 GHz signals in a wireless system cost
effectively and increase the spectral efficiency to facilitate multi-gi-
gabit-per-second services, this work reviews three radio-over-fiber
(RoF) systems based on optical frequency multiplication (up to
6 times) to reduce the bandwidth requirement of optical trans-
mitters. Additionally, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) signals with multi-level modulation formats (16 QAM)
are utilized to achieve an ultrahigh data rate of 28 Gbps within the
7-GHz license-free band and compensate for an uneven frequency
response of 60-GHz RoF systems. Negligible power penalty fol-
lowing 25-km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) transmission is
observed, capable of significantly extending the service range to
various applications within a building or campus.

60 GHz wireless system with 7 GHz license-free band include

and IEEE 802.11 VHT. Given a high air-link loss at 60 GHz

Consequently, wireless access networks at 60 GHz require
numerous base stations (BSs) to connect the access points.
However, insufficient bandwidth and serious propagation loss
make a conventional coaxial cable inadequate for the trans-
mission of wireless signals in the microwave/millimeter-wave
range. Therefore, the radio-over-fiber (RoF) system, which
distributes RF signals from a central station (CS) to BS over
an optical fiber, is a promising means of reducing the overall
cost of a 60 GHz wireless access network owing to its nearly
unlimited bandwidth and extremely low propagation loss.
However, 60-GHz optical millimeter-wave generation remains
a challenging task explaining its considerable interest.
Although the feasibility of the 60-GHz RoF system has
been demonstrated using electro-absorption-modulator (EAM)
[1]–[5], 60-GHz equipment and components are required,
subsequently increasing overall system costs significantly.
Moreover, the EAM modulation generates a double side-
band (DSB) signal, which suffers from dispersion-induced
performance fading. Generating a 60-GHz millimeter-wave
signal with frequency doubling and overcoming the disper-
sion-induced performance fading warrant the development
of a double sideband with carrier suppression (DSB-CS)
modulation scheme using Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM).

erated electrical 60-GHz OFDM signals are down-converted
using an electrical mixer with a 55-GHz local oscillator (LO)
signal and then sent into a digital signal oscilloscope to capture
the time domain waveform for off-line demodulation. The
demodulation process includes synchronization, fast-Fourier
transform (FFT), one-tap equalizer, and QPSK demodulator.
Based on the multi-carrier characteristic of the OFDM signal,
one-tap equalizer can compensate for the uneven frequency
response of the 60-GHz components efficiently. Bit error rate
(BER) is estimated from the constellation diagrams to evaluate
the signal performance.
C. Experimental Results of the Frequency Doubling Scheme
OPR of the optical un-modulated sideband to OFDM-modu-
lated sideband significantly affects the receiver performance. In
the conventional SSB modulation scheme, OPR cannot be easily
adjusted. An additional narrow band optical filter is normally
required to suppress the original optical carrier and enhance the
receiver performance [34]. The proposed TSSB system gener-
ates the un-modulated and OFDM-modulated optical sidebands
from two driving signals. Therefore, OPR can be adjusted by
controlling the amplitude of driving signals. Fig. 4 illustrates the
QPSK-OFDM BER versus OPR curves. The best receiver per-
formance is obtained with 6-dB OPR, where the power of the
un-modulated sideband is 6 dB higher than that that OFDM-
modulated sideband. The insets of Fig. 4 show the constella-
tion diagrams with OPRs of dB, 6 dB and 11 dB. Notably,
OPR in OFDM systems are higher than a conventional signal
carrier system, which has 0-dB optimal OPR [34]. Due to the
high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) property, OFDM sig-
nals are sensitive to the nonlinearity of the transmission systems,
while the signal performance can be easily degraded. Therefore,
increasing the optical power of the un-modulated optical side-
band can effectively enhance the OFDM signal performance.
Fig. 5 shows the BER curves and constellation diagrams of
the 13.75-Gb/s QPSK OFDM down-link signals. Without using
the one-tap equalizer, the OFDM signal cannot be recovered due

two desired optical sidebands with the frequency sextupling
obtained are selected using an optical interleave (inset (iii)
of Fig. 6). Since the generated optical signal consists of an
un-modulated subcarrier and a data-modulated subcarrier, the
proposed scheme can support high spectral efficiency vector
signals, including M-ary phase shift keying (PSK), quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM), and OFDM signals. Addition-
ally, the proposed scheme does not incur dispersion induced
performance fading. Since un-modulated and data-modulated
optical sidebands are generated from two driving signals, the
receiver performance can be optimized by controlling the
optical power ratio (OPR) between two optical sidebands [34].
Owing to the frequency sextupling using optical up-conversion,
signal processing can be handled using 10-GHz components
with high reliability and low costs.
B. Experimental Setup of the Frequency Sextupling Scheme
Fig. 7 illustrates the experimental setup of the proposed
60-GHz OFDM generating system with frequency sextupling.
A DFB laser is utilized as the optical source. In the first
stage, the sub-MZMs (MZ1-a and MZ1-b) of the DP-MZM
are biased at the minimum transmission point, while the
main MZM is biased at the quadrature point to introduce a
90 phase difference. The OFDM signals are generated at
baseband (BB) using an AWG (Tektronix® AWG7102) with
the following parameters: sampling rate of 20 GSa/s for the
DAC, IFFT size of 256, subcarrier frequency separation of
78.125 MHz, 44 subcarriers generated at BB, and a bandwidth
of 3.4375 GHz. The BB OFDM signals are then up-con-
verted using an electrical mixer with a 10-GHz sinusoidal
signal, subsequently obtaining 10-GHz OFDM signals with
6.875-GHz bandwidth and 88-subcarriers. The total data rate
of the emulated 8-QAM-OFDM signal is 20.625 Gb/s. Next,
the un-modulated optical sideband is generated using another
10-GHz sinusoidal signal. The 10-GHz OFDM signal and
10-GHz sinusoidal signal are divided into two paths (upper
path and lower path). Additionally, the modified SSB signal
using the SSB-CS modulation scheme is generated by adding
a 90 phase delay to the upper path of the OFDM signal and
the lower path of the 10-GHz sinusoidal signal. The upper path
and lower path signals are combined and sent to DP-MZM. At
the output of the first stage, a 20-GHz modified SSB signal is
obtained (inset (1) of Fig. 7). The 20-GHz OFDM signal is then
sent to the second stage for optical up-conversion. The second
DP-MZM is utilized for optical up-conversion with frequency
quadrupling. The sub-MZMs (MZ2-a and MZ2-b) are biased
at the maximum transmission point while the main MZM is
biased at the minimum transmission point. The 10-GHz driving
signal of the second DP-MZM is divided into two paths, and
a 90 phase delay is added to the lower path signal. After the
second DP-MZM, both the un-modulated and OFDM-modu-
lated optical sidebands of the 20-GHz modified SSB signal are
up-converted. Inset (2) of Fig. 7 shows the optical spectrum.
Next, a 60-GHz modified SSB OFDM signal is generated using
an optical interleaver to select the desired optical sidebands
(inset (3) of Fig. 7). Following transmission of 25-km SSMF,
the optical signal is received using a V-band PD. The received

Fig. 11. Experimental setup of the proposed system.
IV. FREQUENCY QUINTUPLING SCHEME WITH
ALL-OPTICAL UP-CONVERSION
A. Concept of the Frequency Quintupling Scheme
Though the second scheme is operated at linear E-field
region, an electrical mixer is still needed. A new all optical
up-conversion scheme is proposed to resolve this problem.
Fig. 10 schematically depicts the proposed frequency quintu-
pling system employing all-optical up-conversion. The pro-
posed 60-GHz OFDM transmitter consists of two DP-MZMs for
optical up-conversion and frequency quadrupling, respectively.
For optical up-conversion, OFDM I and Q signals are sent
to MZ-a and MZ-b of the first DP-MZM, respectively. Next,
both MZ-a and MZ-b are biased at the null point to achieve
high optical modulation depth and operate in the E-field linear
region of MZM. Additionally, direct-detection OFDM signals
are realized by inserting an optical subcarrier as a remote het-
erodyne scheme through the use of single side band modulation
with carrier suppression [35]. Therefore, according to inset (a)
of Fig. 10, the generated optical OFDM signal consisting of an
un-modulated subcarrier and an OFDM-modulated carrier can
be converted into electrical RF OFDM signals by square-law
PD detection. Next, the generated optical OFDM signal is
up-converted by using the frequency quadrupling method [36]
(inset (b) of Fig. 10). Following an interleaver to filter out
the unwanted sideband, frequency quintupling is achieved, as
shown in inset (c) of Fig. 10. Notably, the proposed OFDM
transmitter does not require an electrical mixer with a typical
noise figure (NF) of more than 8 dB for up-conversion to 60
GHz. This is an extremely important feature for high spectral
efficiency OFDM signals (i.e., 16-QAM and above) that require
a higher SNR. Additionally, the relative intensity between the
un-modulated and OFDM-modulated subcarriers can be modi-
fied by varying the individual power of the electrical sinusoidal
and OFDM signals to optimize the performance of the optical
RF signals [34].
B. Experimental Setup of the Frequency Quintupling Scheme
The OFDM signals are generated by an AWG (Tektronix®
AWG7102) using a Matlab® software program. The sample
rate and DAC resolution of AWG are 10 GSa/s and 8 bits, re-
spectively. The IFFT length is 64. A 156.25-MSym/s 16-QAM
symbol is encoded at 45 channels, i.e., channels 3–25 and
42–63, with the remaining nine channels set to zero. Therefore,
an optical 28-Gb/s 16-QAM OFDM signal with 45 subcarriers
and occupying a total bandwidth of 7 GHz can be generated. To
realize the optical direct-detection OFDM signal, a new optical
subcarrier is generated at the lower sideband of the original
carrier by 12 GHz (inset (b) of Fig. 11). Notably, the undesired
sideband suppress ratio is greater than 28 dB, which only
slightly influences the performance of the generated OFDM
signals. The generated OFDM signal is up-converted by using

TABLE I
COMPARISON OF THREE PROPOSED SYSTEMS
V. COMPARISON
Table I shows the comparison of three proposed systems.
Though TSSB is the simplest and requires only one dual-elec-
trode MZM, there are several drawbacks that limit the system
performance. Firstly, with only frequency doubling, expensive
electrical components are needed. The OFDM signal is pro-
cessed at 30 GHz and the bandwidth of the transmitter is 33.5
GHz. Secondly, instead of operating at linear E-field region,
TSSB modulation is operated at the linear amplitude region of
the dual-electrode MZM which is biased at the quadrature point.
This nonlinear transfer curve will increase the PAPR-induced
distortion of the generated OFDM signal. To mitigate PAPR-in-
duced nonlinearity impairment, the modulation indexes of the
TSSB scheme for driving the MZM , where
is the peak-to-peak voltage of the OFDM signal and is
the MZM switching voltage at which the voltage-induced phase
difference reaches 180 ) are less than those of the other pro-
posed schemes. Thirdly, an electrical mixer is needed to up-con-
vert the baseband OFDM signal to 30 GHz. With a typical NF
of 8 dB, electrical mixer severely degrades the SNR and limits
the system performance. Hence, the highest signal modulation
format for the TSSB scheme is limited to QPSK. The maximum
data rate of QPSK OFDM signals occupied the full 7 GHz li-
cense-free is 13.75 Gbps.
Compared with TSSB scheme, the frequency sextupling
scheme offers few important improvements. First, the band-
width of the optical OFDM transmitter is less than 13.5 GHz
and OFDM signals are processed at lower frequency, i.e.,
6.5–13.5 GHz. Secondly, to mitigate the nonlinear PAPR issue,
the sub-MZMs are biased at the null point which is the linear re-
gion of the electrical field. Therefore, the frequency sextupling
system can provide 60-GHz OFDM RoF signals with higher
SNR. 20.625-Gbps 8-QAM-OFDM signal generation is exper-
imentally demonstrated with negligible receiver power penalty
following 25-km SSMF transmission. Two stages of DP-MZMs
are required which will increase the system complexity.
To further improve the system performance, the frequency
quintupling scheme is proposed. This scheme has the lowest
bandwidth requirement of the optical OFDM transmitter (i.e., 12
GHz). Since no electrical mixer with a typical NF of more than 8
dB is required to up-convert OFDM driving signals, the OFDM
signal is processed at baseband to ensure higher SNR. More-
over, the external modulator is also operated at E-field linear re-
gion. Therefore, the frequency quintupling scheme can support
highest modulation format and 28-Gbps 16-QAM OFDM sig-
nals are experimentally demonstrated. Nevertheless, two stages
of DP-MZMs which increase the system complexity are also re-
quired in the all-optical up-conversion system.
Notably, although two stages of signal generation and optical
up-conversion are required in frequency sextupling and quintu-
pling systems, WDM up-conversion can be potentially achieved
in these two systems. All WDM channels share only one optical
up-conversion system which is based on the wavelength inde-
pendent frequency quadrupling system [37], and the system cost
can be significantly reduce.
VI. CONCLUSION
This work demonstrates the feasibility of ultra broadband
60-GHz RoF systems beyond 10 Gbps based on optical fre-
quency multiplication. Frequency doubling, sextupling, and
quintupling schemes are also developed to reduce the bandwidth
requirement of optical transmitter. Since the driving signals
are processed at a lower frequency, the proposed schemes can
provide better SNRs of generated electrical 60-GHz signals.
Furthermore, OFDM signals with high modulation formats are
utilized to achieve a data rate (exceeding OR of more than)
10 Gbps within the 7-GHz license-free band and compensate
for an uneven frequency response of 60-GHz RoF systems.
Hence, extremely high data rates of up to 28 Gbps achieved.

photodiode. Since the PN in DDO-OFDM comes from the inter-
action between the laser LW and CD, the power and bandwidth
of PN will be shown to be functions of both the subcarrier fre-
quency and the transmission distance.
To understand this direct-detection PN more thoroughly, we
quantify the PN with the following parameters: the laser PN
is modeled by the Wiener process [5] with a variance of
, where is the laser LW. Before transmission, the signal
with laser PN can be modeled as ,
where is the imaginary unit, and are the complex
amplitudes of the carrier and th data subcarrier [7], respec-
tively, and represents the frequency of the th subcarrier.
After transmission, the CD-induced walk-off will be in-
volved into the signal model which now has a form of
, where is
the relative time delay of the th subcarrier with respect to the
carrier and can be expressed as , of which
is the light speed in vacuum, is the dispersion parameter,
is the fiber length, and is the operated wavelength. Then
the th subcarrier after the photodiode can be expressed as
, where takes the
real part of , the superscript “ ” carries out the complex conju-
gation, and stands for the converted
electrical PN in DDO-OFDM systems [8]. After the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) demodulator, the th subcarrier signal can be
represented as [5], [6]
with , where is
the FFT size and is the timely sampled function of .
Note that the zeroth-order PN , conventionally CPE in
CO-OFDM, is a function of the subcarrier index (frequency)
and, therefore, its value is no longer common to all the data
subcarriers. Thus, we rename simply as “phase rotation
term (PRT)” here because typically it induces only the symbol
rotation when PN is small [5], [6]. For DDO-OFDM, the
received subcarrier signal has a similar form as its wireless
analogy [5], with the following extra assumptions: 1) PN of the
signal–signal beat interference (SSBI) [7] is relatively small
and can be omitted; 2) the PN-to-amplitude noise is negligible,
which usually is true when the sideband is far from the carrier.
Now we obtain the electrical signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR)
and BER by assuming that ICI from adjacent subcarriers are all
independent and Gaussian-distributed [5]. The ESNR, without
considering the PRT, , could be approximated as
(1)
where ESNR is the ESNR of th subcarrier with only
the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise [7]. The BER,
with 4-QAM format, for each subcarrier should consider both
the phase rotation of PRT and the Gaussian-noise terms of ASE
and ICI, and can be obtained as follows [5]:
(2)
where is the random phase rotation and is Gaussian
distributed with a variance of . The system BER can then
be obtained by taking the average of BER [7]. Notably, the

BER with higher QAM formats can be easily derived in a similar
manner [5].
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In simulations, we consider the typical gapped-OFDM
transmission [1] with 20-Gb/s data rate, 160 data subcarriers,
1024 FFT size, 20% cyclic prefix, 2-MHz laser LW, and
16-ps/(nm.km) dispersion parameter for transmission fiber.
The second-order Gaussian optical filters are used with a 3-dB
bandwidth equal to 1.2 (signal bandwidth). In Figs. 2 and
3, we first compare the PN characteristics of the CO- and
DDO-OFDM systems with 16-QAM format. In Fig. 2(a),
we show the PN waveforms of and for the CO-
and DDO-OFDM systems, respectively, with 1600-km fiber
transmission. For DDO-OFDM, we show the results of both
the 1st and 160th subcarriers to emphasize the frequency
dependency. The larger PN variance in CO-OFDM is observed
because of the random walk nature of the Wiener process,
which allows the phase to travel unlimitedly with increasing
time. On the other hand, the PN power of DDO-OFDM will
be constrained by its variance of and thus would
not go unboundedly. Also, in DDO-OFDM, the PN power of
160th subcarrier is twice as large as that of the first subcarrier
due to the doubled accumulated CD. In Fig. 2(b), we show
the PNs’ PSD, which are analytically provided in [8], for both
the CO- and DDO-OFDM systems. For DDO-OFDM, the
results of the 1st and 160th subcarriers are shown with 800-
and 1600-km fiber transmission. The one-sided 3-dB PN band-
width of DDO-OFDM ( 174 MHz for 160th subcarrier with
1600-km transmission) is found to be much broader than that of
CO-OFDM ( 1 MHz), and be a function of both the subcarrier
frequency and the transmission distance. Typically, a higher
subcarrier frequency (i.e., 160th subcarrier) with a longer
transmission distance (i.e.,1600 km) would result in a larger
PN power and a narrower PN bandwidth. In Fig. 3, we further
show the received constellations for CO- and DDO-OFDM
systems with 1600-km transmission. For CO-OFDM, the CPE
has a relatively larger power than ICI and would strongly rotate
the subcarrier phase so that the CPE compensator is a must
at the receiver [6]; while for DDO-OFDM, although the PRT
would similarly degrade the signal by introducing some phase
deviations, due to its broader PN bandwidth, the ICI shows a

Abstract: While coherency between an RF-tone and OFDM signals in RoF 
systems at 60 GHz is de-correlated by fiber dispersion, both phase rotation 
term (PRT) on each subcarrier and inter-carrier interference (ICI) between 
subcarriers are induced at a receiver. We analytically calculate the powers of 
PRT and ICI under different parameters, such as subcarrier number, 
modulation format, laser linewidth and transmission distance. Moreover, 
dispersion-induced ICI is shown to be non-Gaussian distributed by its 
kurtosis, and its distribution depends on system parameters. Therefore, using 
only the power of ICI cannot predict accurate bit error rate (BER) and 
corresponding power penalty. We propose to use t-distribution to fit the 
distribution of ICI, and it can be used to compute BER precisely.

Figure 1 depicts the setup of an OFDM RoF system at 60-GHz band. At the transmitter, a laser 
source is modulated into two coherent monochromatic tones with 60-GHz frequency difference 
[11, 12]. When one of them is used as the RF-tone without further modulation, the other will be 
modulated by an optical I/Q modulator to carry complex OFDM signals [13]. Although various 
architectures can realize identical optical single-sideband OFDM RoF signals [5–7], the 
advantages and disadvantages of different architectures will not be included in this work. While 
coherent RF-tone and OFDM signals with frequency difference of 60 GHz are generated, 
electrical OFDM signals at 60-GHz band can be obtained at the receiver by square-law 
detection. After down conversion, removing the cyclic prefix (CP) and taking discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT), the received qth subcarrier in an OFDM symbol without transmission is 
given as,

Fig. 3. The ICI and PRT powers of OFDM signals over 32 subcarriers with 1-MHz laser 
linewidth after 100-km transmission. 
Since this work focus on the case of OFDM signals at unlicensed band within 57 GHz and 
64 GHz, the dispersion-induced relative time delay is set as ( )2 0qt DLc f f q Nλ= × + ∆ × , 
where 16D =  ps/nm/km is the dispersion parameter, 1550λ =  nm is the signal wavelength, 
c  is the light speed, L  is the transmission distance, and the frequency difference between the 
first (last) subcarrier and the RF-tone is 0 57f = GHz ( 0 64f f+ ∆ =  GHz). Figure 3 shows ICI 
power and PRT power of OFDM signals over 32 subcarriers calculated by Eqs. (5)-(7), and 
each subcarrier has different noise power due to different group delay. In Fig. 3, higher 
frequency corresponding to more relative group delay results in more differential PN and 
higher PRT power. Nevertheless, since 2| ( ) |
m
I k  is a circular function and 2ICI ( 1)Nσ −ɶ  is 
mainly contributed by 22| (1) |NI −  (high relative group delay) and 20| ( 1) |I −  (low relative 
group delay), 2ICI ( 1)Nσ −ɶ  is lower than 2ICI ( 2)Nσ −ɶ . However, higher frequency basically 
corresponds to higher ICI power.

As a result, when the relative group delay is small and qn N<< , the normalized ICI power 
is,

which is proportional to the relative time delay and depends on the subcarrier number little. 
However, if the relative group delay is large and 1qn N= − , the ICI becomes

In this case, ICI is proportional to the subcarrier number, but it is independent on the 
relative time delay implying that it does not increase as further extending the transmission 
distance. This approximated results of Eqs. (9) and (11) are identical to the results in 
coherent-detected OFDM systems [17], since large group delay makes the RF-tone and OFDM 
signals to be completely incoherent. Moreover, Eqs. (8) and (10) are plotted by the dotted lines 
in Figs. 4(a) and (b) for comparison, respectively. However, the dashed lines representing Eqs. 
(9) and (11) only show the case of N = 32 in Figs. 4(a) and (b), because qt t∆  is only about 38 
after transmission of 700 km. 
 
Fig. 5. The kurtosis excess of the real part of ICI 
From Eq. (4), PRT is approximated as the summation of Gaussian distributed random 
variables, and therefore, it is also Gaussian distributed. However, according to Eq. (3), since 
ICI is the summation of independent but non-identical distributed random variables, the central 
limit theory cannot be applied, and ICI may not be normally distributed. Actually, ICI is not 
Gaussian distributed, and this can be shown by calculating its kurtosis excess. The definition of 
kurtosis excess, 2γ , is 
4
4 3µ σ − , where 4µ  is the forth central moment and 
2σ  is the 
variance. For a normal distribution, 4µ  is 
23σ , and therefore, 2γ  is zero. While the real and 
imaginary parts of ICI have independent and identical distribution, the kurtosis excess of the 
real part (or imaginary part) can be derived as

The results of Eq. (12) with q = N/2 are plotted in Fig. 5. For ICI, fewer subcarriers and 
higher dispersion will result in higher kurtosis and more deviation from a normal distribution.

( )Q( ) erfc 2 2x x=  is a normalized form of the cumulative normal distribution function, 
and 2| |S qP Wρ =  is the SNR. Numerical simulation results are plotted in Fig. 7 to show the 
estimation error by setting ICI Gaussian-distributed. The estimation error will increase as 
2,ICIγ  or 
2
ICIσɶ  increasing. For 4-QAM, the case of N = 128 shows higher error, compared with 
the case of N = 32, due to larger 2ICIσɶ . However, the error reduces from N = 32 to N = 128 for 
64-QAM owing to the reduction of 2,ICIγ . Furthermore, although the dispersion-induced ICI is 
assumed to be Gaussian-distributed to estimate theoretical BER in direct-detection optical 
OFDM systems [10], the underestimation of BER increases after longer transmission distance 
corresponding to the higher power and the higher kurtosis of ICI. 
4. Using t-distribution to simulate ICI 
From Figs. 5-7, it is evident that assuming ICI to be Gaussian distributed is not precise. While 
the kurtosis excess can be computed by Eq. (12), a known distribution with adjustable kurtosis 
and zero skewness may be utilized to approach the exact distribution. A good candidate in the 
Pearson system is the Pearson type VII distribution [18], i.e. the well-known t-distribution, of 
which the normalized probability density function (pdf) is,

and ( )xΓ  is the Gamma function. The variance and kurtosis excess of ( )p xν  are 1 and 
6 ( 4)ν − , respectively. While ν  approaches infinity, kurtosis excess is zero and it becomes a 
normal distribution. By setting 2,ICI4 6ν γ= + , the corresponding CDFs of the t-distribution 
are plotted by the dashed lines in Fig. 6(b), and the t-distributions have good agreement with the 
numerical results. To further examine the similarity between the t-distribution and ICI 
distribution, Eq. (10) is used to calculate BER curves, and the theoretical BER becomes Eq. (6) 
after replacing Q( )x  by T( , )Wx ν  [18]:

一、參加會議經過 
2011 年美國光纖光電通訊研討會(Optical Fiber Communication Conference, OFC)於美國加
州洛杉磯 conventional center 舉行，會議為期五天。OFC 在光通訊領域中是一個相當重要的學術
會議。每年都有來自世界各國的頂尖學校與研究機構在 OFC 發表研究成果，除了學術與研究單位
外，光電或光通訊元件的相關廠商也會參加展覽，展示各公司最新的技術與產品。參加 OFC 不只
能了解世界各地於光通訊領域發展的情況也能拓展自己的眼界。 
會議主要有 short courses、論文發表和廠商展覽，論文報告分為口頭報告(Oral 
presentation)以及壁報報告(Poster presentation)，口頭報告依照不同類型的研究領域分類後依
主題在不同的場地發表，這次投稿的論文在會議的最後一天下午口頭報告，在上台報告的前幾天就
參加與研究有關的會議並了解外國學者如何報告研究成果。 
 
二、與會心得 
這次參加 OFC 並能上台報告自己的研究成果，是一個很難得的經驗，看到來自全世界的頂尖
學術和研究單位發表成果，聽取這些先進的報告，對於在光通訊在未來發展的趨勢會有更多的了
解。會議中也請來了 AT&T 與 IBM 等國際知名的大公司的高級主管來發表演說，在他們的演說中更
能看到業界對於通訊領域大環境的看法與公司在未來數年的發展時間表與預計發表的新技術，在不
久之後就能使用報告中所提到的新科技。 
由於口頭論文報告的時間是在會議的最後一天，在前幾天大多參與 OFDM、Radio over Fiber、
Long reach PON 與 Single carrier 的相關報告，也學習他們報告的方法，這對於我的口頭報告有
很大的幫助，我的報告是在會議的最後一天，三月十日下午 2:15~2:30，這不是我第一次以英文報
告，但是第一次在這種大型的國際會議報告，但這是一個非常獨特的經驗，所以無論如何都要盡力
做到最好，在還沒去美國之前就已經練習過數次，所以報告的過程也是相當的順利。 
參加 OFC 會議這是一個很好的與研究領域相近的外國學者互相交流的機會，在聽取許多報告
的時候，有時聽眾對報告的內容有興趣時，不只會對報告者提問，更會在報告後互相討論，能多
和外國學者交流，聆聽不同的想法與聲音，也是個不可多得的機會。 
    在 OFC 當中發表的論文品質都相當的不錯，參與此次會議除了看到自己的研究方向是否符合研
究的潮流，也可以看到自己的研究成果是否可以跟其他知名大學及研究機構比較。台灣在光通訊領
域當中，礙於研究經費的限制，很多很好的想法都因為沒有儀器及元件的支援而作罷，我覺得這是
相當可惜的一件事。
