ABSTRACT
The purpose of this work was to study the use of
TiO2 with UV–Ozone for surface modification of
polyolefin materials, including LDPE, HDPE, and PP.
Modification treatment was carried out using a
benchtop photoreactor, and specimens were exposed to
UV wavelength (254 nm) and ozone in the presence of
TiO2 nanopowder inside the reactor. Certain functional
groups formed on polymer surface as a result of
modification were determined by FT-IR and contact
angle meter. Less time required was observed by the
treatment of UV/O3/TiO2 to achieve surface
modification on polyolefin polymers compared to
UV/O3. The intensity of transmittance dropped at
certain wavelengths and the decrease of water contact
angels ascertained the surface oxygenation.
INTRODUCTION
The specific surface chemistry and low polar free
energy of polyolefin substrates affect the adhesion
properties and limit their application, such as
incorporation of particular functional components to
fabricate active packaging materials. Surface
modification serves as surface functionalization to
modify the surface layer of a polymer by inserting
some functional groups onto the surface, therefore,
improve its wettabliliy, sealability and adhesion to
other components (Liston and others 1993).
Surface modification using ultraviolet irradiation
and ozone has been widely reported to increase the
oxygen functional groups on polymer (McIntyre and
Walzak 1995; Bai and others 1996; Mathieson and
Bradley 1996; Ozen and others 2002; Chen-Yang and
others 2004). Generally, TiO2 is sensitive to UV
irradiation, photocatalytic reactions occurring on the
TiO2 surface create an electron-hole pair, and then
generate certain active oxygen species in the presence
of water and/or oxygen/ozone (Gerischer 1995; Pichat
and others 2000; Von Gunten 2003).
Since, the photolytic reaction may lead to an
increase of hydrophilicity of the naturally inert polymer
surface (Fig 1), this study aimed to develop a
bench-top surface modification process using
UV/O3/TiO2.

B. Surface modification process
1. Development of Reaction Chamber
A surface modification reaction chamber was
constructed in this study using plexiglass materials
(Fig. 2), and the modification process was then
undertaken in the chamber.
Fig 2. Reaction chamber for surface modification
(A): the reactor was constructed using 8mm plexiglas
(12 x 30 x 10 cm, W x L x H, vol. 3000 ml3). An
open (W x L, 25 x 7.5 cm) on the top panel was
crafted for placing UV lamp, and 2 holes (15
mm diameter each) on side panel were drilled
and then installed with Swag-lok valves for
ozone flow

2. Surface Modification Process
A. Surface modification reactor : polyolefins were
placed in a reaction chamber and processed using
ultra violet, ozone and titanium oxide for surface
modification in this study. The ozone and titanium
oxide were activated by ultra violet irradiation to
produce highly reactive radicals, and cause
structure modification.
To prevent the additives in polymer causing errors,
polyolefin materials were pre-washed by soaking
polymer in acetone for overnight to remove
coating on surface. The procedures are as follows:
a. Reactor: a benchtop reactor was constructed in
this study using polyacrylic acid plate (12 cm
x 30 x 10 cm, W x L x H, and 8 mm thickness),
the capacity of reactor was measured 3600 ml.
An open (25 x 7.5 cm, L x W) was made on
