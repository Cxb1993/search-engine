Abstract 
The proposal aims at developing CMOS biosensors for dopamine detection, including those 
based on electrochemical sensing, capacitive sensing, and ion-sensitive field-effect transistors 
(ISFET). We also develop a multi-electrode electrochemical sensing and cell-stimulating biochip 
in a conventional CMOS process. The chip will be used as the platform for basic research and 
practical surgery of the Parkinson’s disease with its unique capability in real-time localized 
detection of the dopamine neuro-transmitter.  
We have published 5 journal papers and 6 international conference papers during the span of 
this 3-year project. We have obtained fruitful results on the dopamine sensing devices based on 
electrochemical, capacitive, and ion detections, achieving detection limits down to sub-µM, 
sub-fM, and fM, respectively. They have been published in IEEE sensors journal, Biosensors and 
Bioelectronics, and IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices. We also have test results on the integrated 
cell stimulating and electrochemical dopamine sensing chips with successful enhancement on cell 
growth and 2-D dopamine detection.

電化學感測電路設計：The CMOS sensing circuit as shown in figure 2(b) is designed and 
fabricated by using the TSMC 0.35-µm CMOS process. All transistors are operated at the 
standard 3.3 V. The anode (generator) electrode is connected to the circuit and its bias is provided 
through the virtual ground of an operational amplifier. The gate of the M1 transistor provides 
isolation between the op-amp and the sensing node; in addition, the potential at the sensing node 
is regulated by use of a large external capacitor C1 in the order of nF. The amplifier is a 
conventional two-stage op-amp design with p-type input transistors. It has an open-loop gain of 
67 dB, a unity-gain frequency of 32 MHz and a phase margin of 70° by simulation (output load = 
20 pF and 1 MΩ). The final output voltage is produced through a buffer circuit which is also 
made of the same operational amplifier. The produced oxidation current at the anode is amplified 
by the wide-swing cascade current mirror (M2 to M5) with a current gain of 10. The amplified 
current is then converted to a voltage by use of an integrating capacitor C2 with a value of 4 pF. 
An external clock signal VCLK constantly resets the output and controls the integration time 
through the M6 transistor. The buffer input is reset to the potential provided by the voltage Vb2. 
Simulation results show the circuit can provide a constant current gain in the range between 0.2 
nA to 0.4 µA, equivalent to a dynamic range of 66 dB. By removing the input current source of 
the current mirror in simulation, an input-referred leakage current of 6.4 pA produces a 0.8-V 
output in a 50-ms span. The total circuit size is 370 µm × 280 µm. For an input current of 1 nA, 
the current mirror and the op-amp consume 36 nW and 0.9 mW, respectively. 
金電極感測結果：The microelectrode die and the CMOS die were placed on a small PC board 
and connected through wirebond; in addition, the CMOS die was covered by epoxy as shown in 
figure 2(c).  
Output waveforms were measured at input current values from 10 pA to 1 µA as provided by a 
sourcemeter. Figure 2(d) depicts the current gains for all cases obtained by experiment and 
simulation. The measured gain curve deviates from the desired gain of 10 at tenths of pA and 
hundreds of nA. The measured dynamic range is about 60 dB, 6 dB less than the simulated value. 
The inaccuracy of the simulated current gain for low current values can be explained by taking 
the simulated leakage current of 6.4 pA into account. The measured leakage is about twice of the 
simulated value to produce a larger deviation in the measured current gain. Cyclic voltammetry 
was performed using the fabricated microelectrodes to identify the respective oxidation and 
reduction potentials for dopamine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in phosphate buffer solution (pH=8.1, J. 
T. Baker, USA). In the single-mode operation where only one set of the working electrodes (l = 
150 µm, g = 3 µm, and 35 microbands) was used, the molecules adjacent to the electrode was 
oxidized or reduced in the cyclic voltammetry, depending on the voltage value. Figure 2(e) shows 
the measured result of 1-mM dopamine by using an electrochemical workstation (Model 701B, 
CH Instruments, Austin, TX) at a scan rate of 50 mV/sec. One peak occurs at about -0.15 V and 
the other at about 0.5 V, both with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The values near the 
two peaks can be used as the reduction and oxidation potentials.  
 8
The CMOS detection circuit and the microelectrodes were connected and biased to perform the 
electrochemical detection. Figure 2(f) depicts the recorded current values with a background 
value of about 0.4 nA. The corresponding output waveforms from the CMOS circuit at different 
time instants were measured. By using microelectrodes, the sensitivity of produced current with 
respect to dopamine concentration is about 70 times higher than the value (20 pA/µM) reported 
previously.

以 Nafion增加電化學感測選擇比：As a selective detection of redox species in the presence of 
interfering samples is very important in electroanalytical chemistry, coated electrodes have been 
used for electrochemical detection of catecholamines and their metabolites. Nafion, a 
perfluorosulfonated derivative of Teflon and an ion-exchange polymer, is highly permeable to 
cations but almost impermeable to anions. A Nafion-coated electrode is insensitive to anionic 
species like ascorbic acid, and very sensitive to the cationic species such as dopamine and 
norepinephrine. The Nafion-coated nanoimprinted electrodes reported in this work can achieve 
selective dopamine detection. 
奈米壓印金電極製作：Thermoplastic nanoimprint lithography was utilized for fabrication of the 
sub-µm interdigitated electrodes. As in a standard nanoimprint process, a thin layer of imprint 
resist was spin coated onto the substrate. Then the mold with predefined topological patterns was 
brought into contact with the sample and pressed under controlled pressure and temperature. 
After removal of the mold, the patterned resist was used for lift-off of the interdigitated 
electrodes. 
Fabrication of the nanoimprint mold is described as follows. The silicon wafer was spin coated 
with 300-nm photoresist (PMMA 50K) and the sub-µm electrode patterns were transferred by 
using an electron-beam lithography system (Elionix ELS-7800). Exposed resist was developed 
afterward (Shipley developer MF319). Immediately after development, a Cr thin film of 20 nm 
was thermally evaporated and lifted-off in acetone under ultrasonic agitation, followed by 
cleaning in sulfuric acid to remove particles. The sample was then transferred into the reactive 
ion-etching chamber to perform a 300-nm silicon etch by the CF4 gas with Cr as the etch-resistant 
mask. After the dry etch, the sample and the liquid F13-TCS were placed into a chamber that was 
filled with nitrogen gas and heated at 270°C for 2 hours. Evaporated F13-TCS reacted 
immediately to form a covalent linkage with the –OH bond on the mold surface. A F13-TCS 
monolayer was formed as an anti-stiction layer. The subsequent electrode fabrication was 
performed on a 4-in. <100> silicon wafer with a 500-nm silicon nitride grown by plasma 
enhanced chemical vapor deposition. A double-layer photoresist comprising of 300-nm PMMA

Gouy-Chapman-Stern model describes the interface capacitance as the series combination of the 
double-layer capacitance, or so-called the Helmholz capacitance, and the diffuse layer 
capacitance, the Gouy-Chapman capacitance. The constant phase angle impedance arising from 
the interface capacitance is given by the empirical relation: 
  ( ) ( )nCP CjC ω=ω
1                            
where C is the magnitude, n is a constant (0 ≤ n ≤ 1), and ω is the angular frequency. According 
to Fig. 4(c), the sensor output is given by:

where Cs is the capacitance of interdigitated microelectrodes, Cin is the pre-amp input capacitance, 
As is the voltage gain, and Vm is amplitude of the modulation voltage. CI is the total capacitance 
formed by Cox and CCP when Rs and RCT are neglected. For dopamine detection, the produced 
negative charges and the associated dielectric property change of the electrode-analyte 
capacitance reduces the total capacitance between the sensing node and ground, leading to 
increase of the sensed output. The oxide capacitances (Cox) in the three designs are 42 fF, 1.8 pF, 
and 5.4 pF based on calculations using parallel-plate capacitors with a 0.1 µm oxide thickness. 
The constant phase angle impedance CCP becomes dominant when Cox is significant larger. The 
sensitivity with respect to the change of CCP can thus be expressed by:

The buffer amplifier performs continuous-time capacitive sensing with a supplied voltage of 3.3 
V. The complete pre-amp input capacitance Cin also includes the parasitic capacitances due to the 
microelectrode and required signal routing. Placing the circuit beside or beneath the 
microelectrodes results in a small routing capacitance and thus increases the signal-to-noise ratio. 
The second stage drives the output load with a maximum bandwidth of 10 MHz. The large 
bandwidth allows us to perform signal modulation in order to avoid the low-frequency flicker 
noise. The original circuit input capacitance is calculated as 241 fF based on the gain of -2.0131 
dB. The two-stage buffer has a gain between 0.966 and 0.969 for five different simulation 
corners.

第一種電容式感測電路感測結果： Buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4) was first added to the CMOS 
chip after surface functionalization, and 200-nM dopamine solution was added after 60 minutes. 
The measured pre-amp input capacitances were 31 fF, 70 fF, and 234 fF for the three designs on 
the same chip. The measured signal changes were 9.2 mV, 7.1 mV, and 13.9 mV after dopamine 
was added, giving equivalent interface capacitance changes of 0.22 fF, 1.46 fF, and 22 fF for the 
three designs. The measured capacitance changes with respect to time are depicted from Fig. 4(d) 
to 4(f). The sensitivities were 0.046 mV/nM, 0.036 mV/nM, and 0.070 mV/nM, respectively. 
PBS buffer induced an immediate capacitance change in about 30 seconds due to the change of 
electrode-solution interface. It took more than 20 minutes for the output to reach the steady state 
after dopamine was added. The pre-amp output noise was measured by a spectrum/network 
analyzer (Agilent 4395A) with a root spectral density of -85 dBm/Hz1/2, giving an input-referred 
noise of 14.2 µV/Hz1/2. Given the sensitivities as mentioned, the minimum detectable capacitance 
changes were 0.3 aF, 2.9 aF, and 22.5 aF for the three designs in a 1-Hz measuring bandwidth. 
The corresponding minimum detectable dopamine concentrations were 309 pM, 394 pM, and 203 
pM, respectively. The average sensitivities with respect to the capacitance change were -41.82 
mV/fF, -4.86 mV/fF, and -0.63 mV/fF for the three designs. The largest 925-fF design produced 
the largest capacitance change under the same dopamine concentration.  
第二種感測電路搭配 5x5電容式感測電極： A conventional two-polysilicon-four-metal (2P4M) 
0.35-µm CMOS process was used for fabrication of the 5×5 capacitive sensor array. The CMOS 
aluminum layer (metal-3) was used as the electrode material and the inter-metal silicon dioxide 
on metal-3 was used for biomolecule immobilization. The top passivation layers (1-µm Si3N4 and 
0.45-µm SiO2) for chip protection were removed from the electrode areas by dry etch in the 
foundry process. The remaining oxide thickness on the metal-3 electrodes was 0.25±0.035 µm as 
measured by a surface profilometer (Kosaka ET4000a). The silicon dioxide can be further 
thinned down by an optional dielectric reactive etch in order to enhance the signal-coupling 
efficiency and the minimum detectable resolution. Fig. 5(a) illustrates the photo of the complete 
CMOS chip containing the 5×5 interdigitated microelectrodes and the associated sensing circuits. 
The circuits are placed beneath microelectrodes and can be observed through the transparent 
CMOS dielectric layers, except for those larger microelectrodes which completely cover the 
circuits. Interdigitated microelectrodes of five different sizes (types A, B, C, D, and E) were 
fabricated. The electrode thickness and separation are 0.64 µm and 0.5 µm, respectively. 
Capacitive sensitivity is significantly enhanced by taking advantage of the sub-µm spacing 
provided by the CMOS process. Scanning electron micrograph of the type-A design is also shown 
in Fig. 5(a).  
 16
第二種感測電路設計：Fig. 5(b) depicts the schematic of the CMOS self-oscillating readout 
circuit that produces a digital pulse stream whose frequency varies with respect to the 
electrode-analyte capacitance. A fixed current source, which can be adjusted from 1 µA to 16 µA 
by a 4-bit decoder, is used to charge the electrode-analyte capacitor. The interdigitated 
microelectrode is represented by Celec in the figure. Due to a small Celec value from 
miniaturization, the implementation in an integrated-circuit process is highly desirable for 
reducing the parasitic effect and thus enhancing the sensing resolution. As depicted in Fig. 5(b), 
when the ramp signal produced by the charged capacitor reaches the switching level of the 
comparator, a signal is generated to turn on the reset transistor and subsequently to discharge the 
integrating capacitor to ground potential. The delay stage composed of four inverters is used to 
ensure a sufficient length of the reset pulse such that the integrating capacitor can be completely 
discharged. The capacitor resumes integration after reset and the production of reset pulses is 
sustained by the feedback loop.The total capacitance is affected by the electrode-analyte 
impedance on sensor surface. The interface model in our case, as shown in the dashed line box of 
Fig. 5(b), comprises a constant phase angle impedance CCP that represents interface capacitive 
impedance, shunted by a charge transfer resistance RCT, together in series with the CMOS oxide 
capacitance Cox and the solution resistance Rs. The resistance RCT can be neglected since there is 
no electrochemical current produced during the reaction, and Rs is negligible as well. The overall 
impedance as contributed by Cox, CCP, and Celec is therefore purely capacitive. 
The electrode capacitance Celec is positively charged by the current source. The negative 
charges produced after binding of dopamine and CPBA molecules attract positive charges from 
the analyte to form the capacitance CCP. The charge storage capability of the overall capacitance 
Cs, as contributed by Cox, CCP, and Celec, thereby reduces due to neutralization of the positive and 
negative charges. Conversely the positive charges as produced from protonation of boronate and 
amino group in MES buffer increase the overall capacitance Cs. Assume a negligible leakage 
current in the reset transistor, the frequency of the output pulses is related to the capacitance Cs 
by

VCf τ where Vsw is the comparator switching level, IB is the bias current, and 
τd is the time delay caused by the comparator and the inverter delay stage. With a negligible τd, 
the frequency is inversely proportional to the capacitance Cs. The initial pulse frequencies of all 
5×5 sensors were measured under a bias current source of 1 µA and a switching level VSW of 1.65 
V. The electrode capacitances, based on the measured frequencies, were 123±4 fF, 155±5 fF, 
245±29 fF, 640±58 fF, and 1310±73 fF for the five designs, respectively. Those values are larger 
than the capacitances listed in Table 1 because the parasitic capacitances contributed from 
microelectrodes to substrate, routing, and input capacitance of the comparator have to be 
considered. The initial capacitances were quite uniform with percentage deviations of ±3.2%, 
±3.2%, ±11.8%, ±9.1%, and ±5.6%, respectively.  
 
 18
第二種感測電路感測結果：Output frequency changes of the 5 × 5 sensors were monitored 
on a digital oscilloscope (Agilent 54624A) to determine the associated capacitance changes. The 
initial output frequencies for the five designs before surface treatment were 4925±153, 3933±55, 
2501±289, 956±88, and 464±26 kHz, respectively, when operated in air. Initial test by adding 
deionized water on the sensor chip showed that, due to the associated high dielectric constant, the 
capacitances increased by 49.9±9.7%, 62.0±27.8%, 155.0±25.8%, 163.1±50.2%, and 
167.7±21.3% for the five designs, respectively. The result indicates that the sensors are quite 
sensitive to the dielectric property change such that even small air bubbles on sensor surfaces 
should be carefully removed before a measurement.  
Measurements were performed for the modified (processed by UV and APTES) and 
unmodified sensors, respectively. As shown by the test sequence in Fig. 5(c) and 5(d), those 
sensors were first measured under a bias current of 1 µA (step 1), after adding the solution of 
5-mM CPBA, 100-mM EDC, and 10-mM MES buffer (2:1:7) (step 2), and after adding 10-mM 
MES buffer and inserting an Ag/AgCl electrode (step 3). In step 2, the positive charges due to 
protonation of boronate and amino group on the modified sensors increased the total 
analyte-electrode capacitances. The increase of analyte-electrode capacitance for the modified 
sensors was even more significant in step 3 with the inserted Ag/AgCl reference electrode biased 
at ground potential. The reason for the increase was due to that the produced electric field lines, 
whose direction was from the positively charged electrodes to the solution, tended to attract 
negative charges closer to the produced positive charges on sensor surfaces. Fig. 5(c) and 5(d) 
show the percentage capacitance changes for the modified and unmodified sensors, respectively. 
In the final step, the percentage capacitance increases of the modified sensors were 43, 52, 21, 9, 
and 9 times larger than those of the unmodified ones for the five designs, respectively. 
The modified and unmodified chips after CPBA immobilization were used in the following 
experiment. The pulse frequencies of all 5×5 sensors on the two chips were measured for 
increasing dopamine concentrations from 1 aM (10-18 M) to 1 mM. The CPBA immobilized 
sensors were biased at 16 µA such that their initial output frequencies were close to those of 
unmodified ones for convenient comparison. For CPBA-immobilized sensors, after binding with 
dopamine molecules, the frequencies of all 5×5 sensors increased as the negative charges 
produced on sensor surfaces caused the electrode-analyte capacitance to decrease. The percentage 
capacitance changes for the type-A sensors is depicted in Fig. 5(e) and the results of other designs 
are shown from Fig. 5(f) to 5(i). The percentage capacitance changes for the control group were 
either positive or negative, with the average values close to zero. For example, the average 
percentage changes for the unmodified type-A sensors were between -0.3% to 0.2%. The sensors 
of experiment group clearly showed more percentage changes than those of the control group, 
especially at higher DA concentrations. The ratios of the percentage capacitance changes of the 
experiment group over those of control group were all larger than one for the five designs at DA 
concentration of 0.1 fM. Statistical data gathered from the arrays were very useful to the 
understanding of sensor’s resolution.

感測元件製作：The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) 0.35-µm 
two-polysilicon-four-metal (2P4M) CMOS process was used for device fabrication. The process 
flow in Fig. 6(a)-6(d) shows the development of an open-gate ISFET in cross-sectional view. 
After completion of the CMOS foundry process, most of the die area, including the bond pads, 
was covered by the top passivation layer except for the openings on top of ISFETs. A wet etch by 
the piranha etchant (H2SO4: H2O2 = 2:1) was performed through the openings to remove stacked 
metal (aluminum) and via (tungsten) layers, while the CMOS inter-metal dielectric layers were 
used for etch protection. The use of large-piece via layers was against the foundry design rule but 
allowed for fabrication. The piranha solution was constantly heated at 85°C while H2O2 was 
replenished every 20 minutes to maintain the etching rate. The etch rate of piranha for polysilicon 
was nearly zero such that the etch can stop at polysilicon gate. The gate was then removed by a 
diluted KOH solution at 80°C for a short time (18 seconds) to avoid over-etch to the gate oxide 
(Fig. 6(c)). The remaining gate oxide thickness is about 70 to 80 Å according to the foundry 
process parameters. The passivation on bond pads was removed at last for wirebond (Fig. 6(d)). 
Fig. 6(e) shows the SEM of the fabricated device. 
感測原理：The operating principle of dopamine detection using a p-type ISFET is depicted in 
cross-sectional view in Fig. 6(f). Surface functionalization and biomolecule immobilization were 
performed on the gate oxide surface, which was treated with UV/ozone (model 42, Jelight 
company) for 15 minutes followed by immersion in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The 
amino group introduced by APTES was coupled to the added 1-mM CPBA under the activation 
of N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). Then specific reaction of DA and 
CPBA molecules on sensor surface produced negative charges, which affected channel 
conductivity of the p-type ISFET. More positive charges (p-type carriers) were attracted to the 
source-drain channel, resulting in an increase of the source-to-drain current or equivalently a 
decrease of the threshold voltage (in absolute value). 
感測電路設計：The threshold voltage of an open-gate ISFET is affected by the accumulated 
charges on gate oxide. For a conventional MOS transistor, the threshold voltage is given by:

where φg and φsi are the work functions of the gate material and silicon. The second term is due to 
charges in the oxide (Qox), at the oxide-silicon interface (Qss), and the depletion charges in silicon 
(QB). φF is the difference between the Fermi potential of the substrate and intrinsic silicon. In the 
case of ISFET, the expression is :

where Eref  is the reference electrode potential, Ψ is a chemical input parameter as a function of 
solution pH, and χsol is the surface dipole potential of the solvent. Both Ψ and χsol determine the 
interfacial potential, and thus the threshold voltage change, which can be detected by measuring 
the gate-bias change of an ISFET biased at a constant current.  
Fig. 3(a) shows the schematic of the sensing circuit that converts the ISFET source-to-drain 
current to a digital output. The source voltage of the p-type ISFET transistor is controlled via a 
voltage follower. The drain voltage is controlled by a regulation loop composed of a two-stage 
operational amplifier and a source-follower transistor so that the entire ISFET current is directed 
into the integrating capacitor below. The op-amp has a gain more than 65 dB and a phase margin 
more than 60°. The scheme is suitable for integrated-circuit implementation since a small 
capacitor (Cint = 1 pF in our case) can instantly produce a ramp output after being charged by the 
ISFET current; in addition, the parasitic effect is reduced by integrating the capacitor on chip. 
When the ramp output reaches the switching level of the comparator, a reset signal is generated to 
turn on the transistor Mres and subsequently to discharge the integrating capacitor to ground 
potential. The delay stage composed of four inverters is used to ensure a sufficient length of the 
reset pulse such that the integrating capacitor can be completely discharged. The capacitor 
resumes integration after reset and the production of reset pulses is sustained by the feedback 
loop. The output driving circuit consists of four inverters with increasing transistor sizes in order 
to reduce capacitive loading to prior stage while providing sufficient driving capability to the 
output load. Assume a negligible leakage current and the parasitic capacitance is much less than 
Cint, the frequency of reset pulses is related to the ISFET current as given by:

where Vsw is the comparator switching level and τd is the time delay caused by the comparator 
and the inverter delay stage. Each ISFET has its own detection circuit with a size of 210 µm × 
360 µm. The sensing circuit can in fact be shared by many ISFETs while implementing a sensor 
array with the use of MOS switches to select the desired ISFET for detection. 
量測結果：  The current-voltage (Isd-Vsg) curves of p-type ISFETs under different DA 
concentrations were measured by using a Keithley 2602 source meter. The gate bias Vg set by the 
Ag/AgCl electrode and the drain voltage were zero such that Vsg = Vsd, which ensured the devices 
to operate in saturation region when Vsg was larger than the threshold voltage. Dopamine was 
diluted in 10-mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer to obtain four different 
concentrations from 1 fM to 1 nM, differing by a factor of 100. The 10-mM MES buffer was first 
injected by a micro-pipette and then dopamine concentrations from low to high were successively 
injected. Fig. 6(h) and 6(i) show the measured Id-Vsg curves for functionalized ISFETs with 
channel width/length ratios of 3 µm/1 µm and 30 µm/1 µm, respectively. The measured curves

生長，並且利用鈣離子通道阻斷劑(LaCl3)可以完全抑制電刺激所誘導的 PC12 細胞的神經
軸生長。由此文獻結果可知，電訊號會影響細胞內鈣離子的流動進而影響到 PC12 細胞的
神經軸生長。神經軸生長是神經細胞型態分化的一個標誌。隨後同研究團隊報導，電訊號
會誘導在神經分化上有重要角色的基因 c-fos，利用 LaCl3阻斷鈣離子通道亦會抑制電刺激
所誘導的 c-fos基因表現。此研究也指出，電刺激也會透過 protein kinase C (PKC)激酶影響
PC12細胞的神經軸生長。另一研究也指出，電訊號的刺激，也會誘導 PC12 細胞產生神經
分化之標誌物，如: NF-200和β3-tubulin。  
儘管在許多文獻中指出電刺激可以促進神經的分化或再生，但電刺激對於促進神經分
化的機轉仍尚未清楚確立，所以我們在此研究中使用 PC12 細胞培養於 indium-tin oxide 
(ITO)電極上再給予 PC12 細胞 電刺激，並觀察電訊號對 PC12細胞的生長分化及細胞內訊
息傳遞的影響，以釐清電訊號刺激促進神經軸生長之分子機轉的調控。若能了解電刺激在
細胞分子層次上之影響，有助於未來藥物設計，以期提供神經性疾病治療上的新曙光。 
實驗方法與材料 
一、試劑: 
  Anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK1/2)及 Bovine serum albumin(BSA)購自
於 Sigma (S. Louis, MO). Anti-pERK1/2、Anti- AKT、 Anti-pAKT(S473)、Anti-signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)及 Anti-pSTAT3(S727)購自於 Cell Signaling (Danvers, 
MA). NGF 及 rat-tail collagen I 購自於 BD Bioscience (Bedford, MA). BCA assay 試劑購自
於  SantaCruz Biotechnology. IRDye800CW-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody 購自於
LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). Alexa-Flour® 700-goat anti-mouse secondary antibody 購
自於 Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). 
二、細胞培養及電刺激: 
  所採用之 PC12 細胞購自 American Type Culture Collection。PC12 細胞種植在覆蓋
濃度 0.1 mg/ml膠原蛋白的 ITO晶片上，並在 37°C， 10% CO2的環境中以培養液 (DMEM, 
10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM antibiotic-antimycotic) 
維持 PC12 細胞的生長。在細胞培養 24小時後，先給予細胞 50 mV/100 Hz 或 200 mV/100 
Hz的電刺激訊號 2小時，再給予 100 ng/mL或 50 ng/mL 的 NGF，且在電訊號刺激第 24
及 48小時時，使用 Carl Zeiss Observer Z1倒立光學顯微鏡拍攝 PC12 細胞的神經軸生長及
分化情形。 
三、細胞均質液製備及西方墨點分析法 
  PC12 細胞培養在 ITO晶片上 24小時後，將培養液置換成無血清的培養液(DMEM, 
1% BSA ,1 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM antibiotic-antimycotic)中 16小時，再先給予細胞 50 
mV/100 Hz的電刺激訊號 2小時，隨後給予 100 ng/mL NGF 2小時。之後將晶片至於冰上，
將培養液吸乾，並以 PBSV，清洗三次。加入 RIPA(50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 
 28
胞分化。所以我們想釐清電刺激是否會藉由影響NGF誘導的下游訊息傳遞路徑而促進PC12 
細胞的神經軸生長與分化。由 Fig. 11 顯示，在單獨給予電刺激訊號時，並無影響細胞內
STAT3和 ERK1/2的磷酸化情形，但會稍微降低 AKT的磷酸化。在 NGF作用下，電刺激
訊號會更促進 ERK1/2的磷酸化，但電訊號對 NGF所誘導的 STAT3及 AKT蛋白之磷酸化
並無差異。所以由我們的研究結果可以得知，電刺激訊號可以透過促進 NGF 所誘導的
ERK1/2磷酸化，進而促進 PC12 細胞的分化。

由傳輸閘來控制刺激訊號的輸出與否，而傳輸閘的控制訊號將分別由行與列的解碼器訊號
透過 NAND邏輯閘來判斷，唯有 Col 與 Row 同時為 1時刺激訊號才可輸出至電極。又本晶片
之刺激單元為三十二乘三十二之陣列，因此需要兩個五對三十二之解碼器分別對行與列解
碼的部分。前述之即之刺激電路可完成電路架構如圖 4.5 所示。圖 4.6 則為打線與封裝完
的 SEM 圖，其中央即為電極陣列。電路量測部分，如圖 4.7 輸入一 ramp 波來觀察輸出擺幅
範圍，其結果模擬相符合。在溶液中實際操作，亦可透過 Ag/AgCl 對溶液內訊號的量測，
如圖 4.8 使用計數器(Clock)每半周期切換一個輸出位置，可發現不同位置的電極皆可順利
驅動金電極/溶液之介面阻抗，送出電刺激訊號。在電刺激對於細胞影響的方面，使用透明
之測試晶片做培養並刺激，希望以電刺激來取代神經生長因子(NGF)使 PC12分化的功能，
惟其結果並不理想。推測是由於其對 PC12分化之定義與不同，文獻採用長為 10µm，我們
採用 25µm。用低長度做為定義分化時，可能很容易將 PC12細胞體之延伸而非神經線的部
分誤計之，在此對其結果採取保留的態度。我們改以觀察電刺激對以分化細胞生長之影響，
發現在適當的條件下，如圖 4.9 可發現電刺激對 PC12 有促進神經線生長的情形，尤其在
>0µm時有 10%之差異，可以推測電刺激對於神經線的 initiation有較顯著的影響。此外，
我們亦透過西方墨點法檢視存在於細胞內與神經線生長相關的信號通道(signaling pathway)
上的蛋白質作用情形。可得結果如圖 4.10，發現受到電刺激的 PC12在此信號通道中之 ERK
磷酸化的情形為無電刺激的 1.4 倍，此結果指出電訊號會刺激 NGF 所誘導的 ERK 磷酸化
情形上升，這個結果暗示電刺激可能加強神經線之生長。

這個會議基本上是針對感測器的領域，因此與 IEEE舉辦的微機電MEMS或Transducers
會議不同，涵蓋領域較窄但容納更多感測相關的論文，舉凡感測機制的探討、化學及氣體
感測器、生醫感測器、光學感測器、機械及物理感測器、感測器/致動器系統、感測器網路

應用為導向，所以建構的系統是採用已成熟的感測器產品；例如今年工研院有用所建構的

這也是這個會議背後的目的之一，希望鼓勵由感測的應用端出發來改進現有技術的不足，
開發出新的創意及產品。 
今年大會有三個 keynote speech，其主題皆很有特色。第一個演講是 UC Berkeley Prof. 
Maharbiz 的無線甲蟲控制，他展示了許多影片，令人印象深刻。主要他在甲蟲的蛹階段便
在其中移植了刺激電極來控制甲蟲飛行，而且是在甲蟲的非自主意識下，可以往左往右飛
行。會場有一些討論，關於這樣的研究到底有怎樣的願景，其實並沒有一致的結論。這個
美國國防部計畫似乎不能真正做一些無人偵察等國防應用，研究的出發點主要還是來自於
研究者的好奇心與興趣。不過看了許多甲蟲被控制的影片心中倒是覺得不忍。第二個 kenote
是交通大學吳重雨校長給的”Biomedical electronics”。吳校長在電子人工眼領域鑽研多年，
正逐漸邁向可以實現的階段，對於失明者將會是一大福音。第三個 keynote是 Prof. French 
(Delft University of Technology, Netherland)關於感測器製作是否要跟 IC整合的課題，這個
問題我很有興趣，我本身就專注在 CMOS微感測器方面的研究。演講者回顧的許多 CMOS
微機電的製程技術，至於要不要整合其關鍵不一定是在技術，良率可能是更大的考量。也
是因為良率與製作成本，Analog Devices, Inc.現在發展的是兩個晶片的微加速度計（機械結
構與 CMOS感測電路分開），不再是單一 CMOS感測器晶片技術。縱然從設計理論而言，
單晶片整合有降低噪聲的優勢在於降低噪聲，但成本降低對於現今手機及遊樂器等銷售量
非常大的應用非常重要。 
慣性感測器仍然是此會議的主要課題之一，基於許多產品已經成熟，在此研究的創新
並不容易。今年看到較多的陀螺儀研究，會議還邀請美國的專家 Prof. Shekl (UC Davis)做專
題演講。目前陀螺儀已經置入手機及遊戲機，一般作為娛樂用途；Prof. Shekl 提到，要真
正做到能用在導航的陀螺儀，目前MEMS的陀螺儀還是無法做到。接著 Prof. Shekl後面的

Prof. Kraft的陀螺儀，他們利用 6th-order的 sigma-delta迴授系統做感測訊號的 A/D轉換，
成果不錯。我接著請問 Prof. Kraft是否擔心在高的 quality factor及高階迴授系統的穩定性問
題，他只能就實驗成果說明目前穩定性 ok,但我仍有所存疑；其實高階 sigma-delta迴授系統
雖增加訊號雜訊比，但缺點就是系統穩定性。近年來為了研究目的階數是愈做愈高。其實

可以實現的階段，對於失明者將會是一大福音。第三個 keynote是 Prof. French (Delft University 
of Technology, Netherland)關於感測器製作是否要跟 IC整合的課題，這個問題我很有興趣，
我本身就專注在 CMOS微感測器方面的研究。演講者回顧的許多 CMOS微機電的製程技術，
至於要不要整合其關鍵不一定是在技術，良率可能是更大的考量。也是因為良率與製作成本，
Analog Devices, Inc.現在發展的是兩個晶片的微加速度計（機械結構與 CMOS 感測電路分
開），不再是單一 CMOS 感測器晶片技術。縱然從設計理論而言，單晶片整合有降低噪聲的
優勢在於降低噪聲，但成本降低對於現今手機及遊樂器等銷售量非常大的應用非常重要。 
慣性感測器仍然是此會議的主要課題之一，基於許多產品已經成熟，在此研究的創新並
不容易。今年看到較多的陀螺儀研究，會議還邀請美國的專家 Prof. Shekl (UC Davis)做專題演
講。目前陀螺儀已經置入手機及遊戲機，一般作為娛樂用途；Prof. Shekl 提到，要真正做到
能用在導航的陀螺儀，目前MEMS的陀螺儀還是無法做到。接著 Prof. Shekl後面的三篇陀螺
儀研究偏向物理學家做的，分別用光學(Northwestern Univ.)、原子干涉(Stanford Univ.)、及
Nuclear magnetic resonance (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA)原理，便不是我
們微機電用科氏力的這種方式。在我主持的 session有兩篇不錯的陀螺儀研究，一篇一樣是來
自 Prof. Shekl團隊的研究，探討在科氏力原理下，當驅動與感測的結構之 quality factor有很
好的匹配時，原本窄頻的角速度感測能變成大範圍的全角度感測；其工作原理我現在還是沒
有弄懂，應再找其之前期刊論文看一下。另一篇是 Univ. of Southampton Prof. Kraft的陀螺儀，
他們利用 6th-order 的 sigma-delta 迴授系統做感測訊號的 A/D 轉換，成果不錯。我接著請問
Prof. Kraft是否擔心在高的 quality factor及高階迴授系統的穩定性問題，他只能就實驗成果說
明目前穩定性 ok,但我仍有所存疑；其實高階 sigma-delta 迴授系統雖增加訊號雜訊比，但缺
點就是系統穩定性。近年來為了研究目的階數是愈做愈高。其實中國大陸近年來也朝製作陀
螺儀邁進，而且有一些成果出來；雖然有些結構設計有模仿之前文獻，我仍是覺得台灣在這
方面要多加強。台灣在微機電領域努力這麼久，但專注領域一直不在陀螺儀。這使得我目前
一直在思考新的方式以 CMOS製程製作整合型陀螺儀。 
我主持的”Biomedical application”也有一些不錯的論文，像是 Univ. of Louisville製作電極
陣列及 IC來量取心肌的電生理訊號；Univ. of Bremen開發了微流體流速控制的系統，並對流
速感測有適當的溫度補償；Standford Univ.開發了一套微機械結構來量測細胞貼附時的剪應
力；Louisiana Technical Univ.以 patch clamp來打開細胞的 ion channel，藉量測 ion current來判
定細胞是否活著。我主持的”Stress sensing”有一篇有趣的論文，其製作了感測器及致動器，可
以將 nanowire附著在致動器上，經由拉伸而量測出材料的 Young’s modulus.
