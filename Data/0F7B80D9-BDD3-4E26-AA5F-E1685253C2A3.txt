INTRODUCTION 
The rapid development and progress of laser technology has made application in 
medical areas  more and more extensive, such as cancer tumor heating therapy, 
cosmetic  laser therapy etc..  In order to avoid necrosis of good tissues caused by 
excessive thermal energy during the process of in vivo laser surgery, the prediction of 
temperature distribution is very critical.[1]-[8]. 
Pennes’s heat transfer equation was widely implemented to study the thermal effect 
of laser-tissue interaction [9]-[11]. In solving this bio-heat transfer equation, Beer’s 
model which only considering the effect of laser light absorbed by tissues [12], 
[13].was often used to describe the behavior of laser heat source term. Both scattering 
[14]-[16] and thermal diffusion two effects are taken into account, the equation will 
become increasingly complex [17]. In bio-heat transfer issue, laser energy is 
instantaneously applied to one region, and this energy resulted significant energy 
change in the region, this situation is similar to welding heat transfer issue, therefore, 
it is feasible to use welding heat source in bio-heat transfer issue. 
While simulating welding heat source in 1984, Goldak [18] developed a double 
ellipsoid heat source model, its advantage is that it is quite easy to change its heat 
source model and has versatility and flexibility. But Goldak ignored the effect of 
solid-liquid interface, did not take into account the impacts of molten zone and heat 
affect zone on thermal field, these two zones represent the regions of metal changed 
from solid state to liquid state and the region where phase change occurs. Double 
ellipsoid heat source model can correct the effect of molten pool or heat affect zone 
through the adjustment of Gaussian parameters [19], [20], and it is a method that has 
been adopted by many researchers in welding analysis. Rajan [12] used bio-heat 
transfer equation to calculate the latent heat to simulate phase-change (phase change 
temperature is 100ºC) of tissues, and assumed regions of occurring phase change 
phenomena of vaporization, melting as the equivalence as heat affect zone of welding. 
Laser has characteristics of strong penetration ability on tissues, the energy density 
distribution of rear half part is larger than the energy density distribution of front half 
part while laser acting on tissues, double ellipsoid function can change energy density 
distribution trend by adjusting Gaussian parameters, so that simulation result is closer 
to real situation. However, it is required to adjust more parameters when using double 
ellipsoid heat source function as laser heat source term, so in this study at first made 
adjustment on Gaussian parameters in ellipsoid function and thermal efficiency. 
Currently, Nd: YAG laser and diode laser are often used in inner layer skin laser 
treatment process, such as for hemangioma and vascular malformation [21], [22], the 
3 
 
veins； and Qm, Qr, and Ta are metabolic rate, laser heat source term, and arterial 
blood temperature of the tissues. As the porcine liver used in the experiment is not in 
vivo, so the influences of flow of blood and metabolism of tissues on temperature are 
very small, so Eq.(1) can be simplified into:

Sysweld software is finite element analysis software developed by ESI Company 
[25], its main function is for handling phase change generated in welding and 
calculating residual stress and temperature produced by welding. While in the 
establishment of the grid model, the Company has developed a more user-friendly 
subsidiary software Visual mesh operated in Visual environment, it can be used to 
perform various functions, such as combining elements and nodes between objects, 
and simplify modeling procedure; when Visual mesh is used in model with more 
complex geometries, it has more user-friendly functions for easily and quickly 
constructing a model. 
Considering the geometric model of porcine liver as an axisymmetric rectangular 
model with dimension of 20mm × 10mm × 20mm, Fig. 4 shows the mesh model of 
porcine liver. The model has a total of 18,000 elements, and a total of 6,057 nodes. 
B. Laser heat source 
In analyzing of bio-heat transfer, Yilba [26] proposed a 1-D heat source model to 
solve 1-D thermal field issue. And Fanjul [27] proposed a 3-D heat source model for 
solving 3-D thermal field issue, the heat source function can be expressed as:

     
                 (3)         
where s is laser beam radius, μa (mm-1) is absorption coefficient, and I0 (W/mm2) is 
laser intensity. This study used double ellipsoid heat function to simulate laser light 
source based on the theory firstly proposed by Rosenthal in 1940 [28]. The drawback 
was that the thermal field near heat source to be distorted. Pavelic [29] in 1960 
proposed a plane Gaussian heat source mathematical model that heat energy 
distribution in a round plate is Gaussian distribution to solve Rosenthal’ problem. And 
in 1984, Goldak proposed double ellipsoid heat source function, this function 
considers that the temperature gradient in the front half part of heat source is changed 
more largely than that in the rear half part, (4) represent power density of the front  
and rear half parts of heat source respectively.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Surface thermal field distribution of adjusting Gaussian parameters 
When double ellipsoid Gaussian function is used to simulate laser heat source, 
surface thermal field distribution due to diode laser surgery can be obtained by 
adjusting Gaussian parameters and thermal efficiency. The position of surface thermal 
field of heat center is at coordinates (0, 10, 20) shown in Fig.6, and the position on 
which of the laser acts on under the surface of porcine liver. Experimental condition is 
fixed 10W10s3mm. Fig. 7 shows the surface temperature curve around the center of 
heat source and along x-axis direction. The Gaussian parameters combination used are 
a=b=1, cf=cr=7 and thermal efficiency to be 0.15. This figure shows the maximum 
surface temperature is about 38ºC, and the change of surface temperature is 16ºC. 
B. Surface thermal field distribution of different powers 
After the adjustments of Gaussian parameters and thermal efficiency of laser diode 
obtained in previous section, then the   surface thermal fields can be calculated 
under fixed irradiation time, and 3mm distance between laser and surface of porcine 
liver at different powers. Fig. 8 shows the surface temperature curve around the heat 
source center along X-axis direction under different powers. It shows that values of 
maximum surface temperature power are 27ºC, 38ºC and  47ºC corresponding to the 
power 5W, 10W and 15W. The maximum surface temperature is increasing with 
power increase and surface temperature rising rate is highest at 10W. Fig. 9 shows the 
surface thermal field distribution of different powers by Sysweld. 
C. Surface thermal field distribution of different laser irradiation times 
When the power is fixed at 10W, and distance between laser and surface of porcine 
liver is fixed at 3mm, Fig. 10 shows surface temperature curve under different laser 
irradiation times. When the time is 10 seconds, the maximum surface temperature is 
about 38ºC with an increase of 16ºC. And when the time increased from 10s to 15s, 
the surface temperature again increased about 16ºC, and the maximum temperature 
then is 54ºC. When the time is increased from the 15s to 20s, the temperature at the 
center of heat source increased by 6ºC, the maximum temperature then is 60ºC. From 
7 
 
between laser and surface of porcine liver is 3mm, the maximum surface temperature 
is 27~47ºC.  When irradiation time of diode laser is within the range of 10s~20s, 
power is 10W, and the distance between laser and probe is 3mm, the maximum 
surface temperature is 37~60ºC. When the distance between laser and surface of 
porcine liver is 3~7mm , power is 10W, and irradiation time is 10s, no change in 
surface temperature from exceeding 3mm.    When applying laser in clinical 
surgery, if power is below 10W and laser irradiation time is less than 10s, it is 
recommended that the laser depth is not less than 5mm, to avoid thermal damage in 
surface of tissues caused by increase of surface temperature. 
Thermal damage volume within tissues of porcine liver under different irradiation 
times is about within the range of 60~180 mm3; thermal damage volume under 
different powers is about within the range of 30~120mm3; while in changing distance 
between laser source and the surface of porcine liver, the thermal damage volume is 
almost no change.

Inasmuch as the spatial distribution of targeted blood vessels varies in HVL, 
optimum Intralesional Laser Photocoagulation (ILP) and Cryogen Spray Cooling (CSC) 
parameters must be selected based on an individual patient basis and HVL pathology. 
ILP is thought to act via a combination of vaporization, photocoagulation and 
thrombogenesis end up with decreasing volume of these vascular tumor and releasing 
symptoms.  Its advantages are that it is minimally invasive and that the area 
exposed during surgery is smaller.  Using the technique of ILP with the wavelength 
of 810nm, 940nm, 1064nm, nonspecific thermal injury to the normal overlying skin 
and adjacent structures occurs and therefore, virtually the complications of 
hypertrophic scarring, changes in the normal skin pigmentation, atrophy, or 
induration are inevitable. 
Based on the result, subjects with hemangioma and HVL will be collected in our 
future studies .  For all subjects, the primary efficacy measure using the 
quantitative assessment of photocoagulation with volume reduction will be made 
on a blinded basis as well as prevention of superficial thermal damage.  The 
occurrence of adverse effects such as hypertrophic scarring, changes in the normal 
skin pigmentation, atrophy, or induration will also be documented.  This study 
will be extended to different laser system such as Diode laser with wavelength
