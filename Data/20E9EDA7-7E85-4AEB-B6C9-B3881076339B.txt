savings through increased speed and 
accuracy of data entry. This study provides 
information on radio-frequency identification 
(RFID) and its potential applications in the 
construction supply chain management. 
RFID involves the use of miniature 
read/write transponders that are capable of 
storing data in harsh environments. The 
RFID technology is currently used in several 
applications outside the industries, and is 
seen as having potential in the construction 
industry. Potential construction applications 
for RFID technology discussed here include 
concrete processing and handling, cost 
coding for labor and equipment, and 
materials control. Discussion of limitations 
of RFID technology for construction 
applications includes proximity of equipment, 
costs, and workforce attitudes. This study 
demonstrates the effectiveness of a 
RFID-based supply chain management 
application and system in construction 
projects, demonstrating that it responds 
efficiently and enhances the information flow 
among offices and sites in a construction 
supply chain environment. A construction 
industry-RFID supplier workshop was held to 
disseminate information about this 
technology and to generate suitable 
application ideas for the industry. With the 
information gathered during the workshop, 
one application idea was selected and pilot 
tests conducted to learn more about RFID 
and its applicability to the construction 
supply chain management. The system is also 
then applied to a selected real case study to 
verify the proposed methodology and 
demonstrate the effectiveness of information 
sharing of project control in the construction 
phase.  Finally, conclusions and suggestions 
are drawn regarding possible future impacts 
on construction industry.
