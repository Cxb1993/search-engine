Abstract:
In this two-year project, we investigated the phase behavior effects on the
characteristics of particulate samples, which were produced from the supercritical
anti-solvent (SAS) processes. Three major topics have been studied which include
dispersiods preparation of pigment red 177 particles with the aid of supercritical
carbon dioxide, ultra-fine particles preparation for pigment green 36 via supercritical
anti-solvent treatment, and nanoparticle formation of metallocene catalyzed cyclic
olefin copolymer (mCOC). According to our experimental results, it was found that the
phase behavior of mixture in the high pressure vessel during the supercritical fluid
processing is one of crucial factors to govern the morphology and the mean particles
size of the particulate products taken from experimental runs. Nano-metric or
sub-micron particles can be obtained as the supercritical fluid treatments were operated
in supercritical phase region or compressed liquid phase region. Mirco-metric particles
may be formed in the superheated vapor phase region, while serious aggregation of
primary particles was found and even dense cake-like films may be generated in the
vapor-liquid coexistence region. The results of each studied topic have been published
in the SCI journal. These three journal papers are compiled in this final report.

Abstract
A series of experiments was conducted to investigate the dispersion of 1 wt % of
pigment red 177 particles in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA). It
was found that 40 wt % of Hypermer PS3 dispersant could provide better dispersion
and could stabilize the pigment particles in PGMEA at ambient condition. With the aid
of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2), additional 1 wt % of CO2-philic dispersant,
Zonyl FSO-100, could further enhance the dispersion. Holding the mixtures in
dispersion chamber at higher temperatures and pressures for a sufficient period of time
was also favorable to improve the dispersion. The size of the dispersed particles
appeared to have a correlation with the phase behavior of the mixtures in the
dispersion chamber. The preferable operating conditions are at 348.2 K and 20 MPa,
and 20 min of holding time was long enough before rapidly releasing chamber’s
pressure. Under the recommended operating conditions, the mean sizes of the
dispersoids could be as small as 148 nm, which met the required range of 100 nm to
200 nm in industrial applications. The TEM images have proven that the supercritical
carbon dioxide-assisted dispersion method could efficiently disperse the pigment
particles in PGMEA.

6helpful in the dispersion process, since the surfactants are possibly carried by
supercritical carbon dioxide and then penetrate into the vacancies of the aggregated
particles. Consani et al. [7] measured the solubility of 130 surfactants in carbon
dioxide at 323 K and pressures from 10 MPa to 50 MPa. Among these investigated
surfactants, fluorinated hydrocarbons were found to be highly CO2-philic. Such
surfactants are potential candidates for the supercritical dispersion process.
In the present study, a supercritical carbon dioxide-assisted dispersion process
with blended dispersants was developed to produce the pigment dispersoids whose
mean sizes were ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm. This size range is generally
acceptable for preparing photo resists. A series of dispersion experiments was
conducted to find the favorable formulations of the blended dispersants and the
preferable operating conditions for dispersing 1 wt % of ultra-fine pigment red 177
particles into PGMEA. The pigment concentration of this study is higher than that of
Cheng et al. [6] by about 500 folds. The supercritical carbon dioxide-assisted
dispersion runs were made at temperatures from 318.2 K to 348.2 K and pressures up
to 35 MPa. The mean sizes of dispersiod samples were determined with a dynamic
laser scattering (DLS) particle analyzer, and the transmittances of dispersoid samples
were measured with a UV/visible spectrophotometer.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Pigment red 177 (aminoanthraquinone red) was supplied by Ciba Special
Chemicals Co., Hong Kong. Its molecular structure has been presented in Wu et al. [4]
Two commercially available dispersants were used in this study. One is a
polyester/polyamine copolymeric dispersant, Hypermer PS3, weakly cationic, 100 %
copolymer (ICI Americas Inc, USA) and the other is a CO2-philic dispersant, Zonyl
FSO-100, F(CF2CF2)1-7CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)0-15H, molecular weight about 725,
nonionic, 100 % fluorosurfactant (du Pont de Nemours and Co., USA). Propylene
glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) (purity of 99.9 mass %), a suitable
chemical for preparation of photo resists, was purchased from Aldrich, USA, and
carbon dioxide (purity of 99.8 mass %) from Liu-Hsiang Gas Co., Taiwan. These
chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2 Apparatus and procedure
8were calibrated with two standard samples (Latex Microsphere Suspensions 5016A,
mean diameter = 160 nm and Nanosphere™ Size Standard3200A, 200 nm, mean
diameter = 1996 nm, Duke Scientific Co., USA). All dispersion runs were repeated
twice at each experimental condition. The mean sizes of the replicated samples could
be reproduced to within about 5 %. Three representative samples were also
analyzed with a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H-7100, Japan) by
depositing the dispersoids on 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids. The
transmittances of four diluted dispersoid samples were measured with a UV/visible
spectrophotometer (JASCO V-530, Japan).
A volume-variable phase equilibrium analyzer has been installed to investigate
the phase boundary of mixtures containing carbon dioxide + dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) with or without pigment blue 15:6 [8]. This apparatus was also employed in
this study to measure the bubble and the dew points of carbon dioxide + PGMEA from
which the critical points at the operating temperatures of dispersion process were
estimated. The relationship between the dispersion of pigment particles and the phase
behavior of mixtures in dispersion chamber will be discussed later. The
volume-variable cell consists of a high-pressure generator (Model 62-6-10, High
Pressure Equipment Co., USA), a sapphire window (Part No.: 742.0106, Bridgman
closure, SITEC, Switzerland), a rupture disk and a circulation jacket. The internal
volume of the cell is adjustable manually with a piston screw pump and the cell is
operable up to 50 MPa and 473.2 K. The cell’s temperature was maintained by
circulated thermostatic water to within 0.1 K. A pressure transducer (PDCR 407-01,
Druck, UK) with a digital indicator (DPI 280, Druck, UK) displayed the cell’s pressure
to within an accuracy of 0.04 %. Two precision syringe pumps (Model: 260D, Isco
Inc., USA) were utilized to charge carbon dioxide and PGMEA, respectively, under
constant-pressure mode. A magnetic stir bar was placed inside the cell to enhance the
mixing of the loaded mixture. The weight of each loaded substance was calculated
from the known charged volume (accurate to 0.01 cm3) and the density value at the
delivery pressure and temperature. While the densities of carbon dioxide were taken
from the NIST Chemistry WebBook [9], the densities of PGMEA were determined
experimentally by a high-pressure densitometer (DMA 512P, Anton Paar, Austria) with
an oscillation period indicator (DMA 48, Anton Paar, Austria) to an accuracy of
10
dispersion agent. The mean sizes grew much slower in the presence of dispersant,
especially for the samples containing Hypermer PS3 greater than 10 wt %. Their sizes
are substantially smaller than that of the blank case on the third day, implying that the
dispersant effectively provided steric barrier to keep the dispersed particles from
re-agglomeration. The mechanism of steric stabilization of the hydrocarbon-based
dispersant suggested that the pigment-affinity groups (segments of the polyamines)
absorbed onto the pigment particles’surface and the solvent-soluble chains (segments
of the polyesters) stretching into the PGMEA liquid phase, and to establish a sufficient
thickness to stabilize the dispersed pigment particles [3, 10]. Under lower
concentrations of Hypermer PS3 (e.g., less than 10 wt %) the dispersant may not form
enough thickness to prevent the particles from re-agglomeration, whereas high
concentrations of Hypermer PS3 (e.g., equal to or greater than 60 wt %) may result in
inevitable flocculation [2]. The experimental results disclosed that using 40 wt % of
Hypermer PS3 (0.4 g Hypermer PS3 to 1 g pigment, on the PGMEA-free basis)
yielded better dispersion. The mean size increased from about 300 nm to 390 nm after
one day of preparation and maintained about the same size up to the 7th day.
3.2 Dispersion with addition of Zonyl FSO-100 and supercritical carbon dioxide
A CO2-philic dispersant Zonyl FSO-100 was tested in this study. It was found
that the initial mean sizes increased monotonically from 335 nm to 750 nm while the
concentrations of Zonyl FSO-100 increased from 3 wt % to 40 wt %. High
concentrations of Zonyl FSO-100 appeared unfavorable to reduce the size of dispersed
particles. Fig. 3 illustrates the results of the samples containing 10 wt % to 60 wt % of
Hypermer PS3 and addition of Zonyl FSO-100 up to 3 wt % (0.03 g dispersant to 1 g
pigment). It also shows that the presence of Zonyl FSO-100 did not significantly affect
the mean sizes of the dispersoid samples as the dispersion process was achieved only
by ultrasonic mixing at ambient condition. However, there are certain benefits by the
addition of this CO2-philic fluorosurfactant, Zonyl FSO-100, when the dispersion was
operated with the aid of supercritical carbon dioxide [7, 11].
More dispersion experiments were thus implemented with the treatment of
supercritical carbon dioxide. Before the dispersoids were rapidly released from the
high-pressure dispersion chamber to the receiver at atmospheric pressure, the pigment
mixtures were maintained at 328.2 K and 20 MPa for 20 min in this series of runs.
12
improve the dispersion of the pigment particles in PGMEA. However, no obvious
influence was found when the holding times were longer than 20 min. It was suggested
that the penetration process of carbon dioxide with the dispersants into the spaces of
agglomerated pigment particles was almost completed at about 20 min.
3.4 Effects of holding temperature and pressure
Table 3 reports the mean sizes of dispersoid samples prepared at different holding
temperatures and pressures (run #14 to run #32). Throughout these 19 runs, the loaded
pigment mixtures have same composition as mentioned in the above section, and the
charging rate of carbon dioxide and the holding time were 2.0 cm3/min at 278 K/6
MPa and 20 min, respectively. Fig. 6 illustrates the effects of holding pressure and
temperature on the mean sizes of dispersed samples. Higher holding temperatures are
favorable to enhance dispersion. The temperature-effect, however, becomes minor as
temperatures higher than 338.2 K, especially at elevated pressures. At a fixed
temperature the mean size decreases with increasing pressure, but the effect sharply
leveled-off as pressures exceeded about 10 MPa. As shown in Table 3, the mean size of
dispersoid could be as small as 145 nm as the dispersion chamber was maintained at
348.2 K and 35 MPa during the holding stage (run #32). While the dispersion
processes were operated at 338.2 K - 348.2 K and 20 MPa during the holding stage,
the mean sizes of the resulting dispersoids were within a range of 148 nm to 160 nm,
which satisfies the requirement (100 nm to 200 nm) for industrial applications.
3.5 Effects of phase behavior
The influences of temperature and pressure on the particles’dispersion may be in
accordance with the phase behavior of the mixtures in the dispersion chamber. To find
this correlation, the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) phase boundaries of carbon
dioxide + PGMEA were measured with the volume-variable phase equilibrium
analyzer. Since the concentrations of pigment and dispersants were very dilute in the
dispersion mixtures during the holding stage (e.g., the mass ratio of pigment :
dispersants : PGMEA: carbon dioxide was about 1 g : 0.41 g : 98.59 g : 218 g), the
phase boundaries of the mixtures in the dispersion chamber could be approximately
represented by those of carbon dioxide + PGMEA, similar to the observations of Wu et
al. [8] for carbon dioxide + DMSO + pigment blue 15:6. Fig. 7 is the VLE phase
diagram of carbon dioxide + PGMEA in the vicinity of critical regions over
14
carbon dioxide; holding at 318.2 K and 5.0 MPa (at subcritical conditions) for
20 min; mean size = 332 nm (i.e., run #14)
(case 4) With 40 wt % of Hypermer PS3 and 1 wt % of Zonyl FSO-100; treated with
carbon dioxide; holding at 348.2 K and 35.0 MPa (at supercritical conditions)
for 20 min; mean size = 145 nm (i.e., run #32)
Each sample was diluted with PGMEA by 500 times before the analysis. Fig. 8 shows
that the transmittances are 87.6 %, 91.3 %, 92.0 % and 95.8 % at the wavelength of
620 nm for the samples obtained from case (1) to case (4), respectively. It again
illustrates the smaller sizes of dispersed pigment particles resulting in the higher
transmittances.
Figs. 9(a) to 9(c) are the TEM images of dispersoid samples taken from cases (1),
(2) and (4), respectively. Serious aggregation of pigment particles is shown in Fig. 9(a),
in the case of no dispersants and without treatment of supercritical carbon dioxide. Fig.
9(b) indicates that better dispersion was obtained by adding appropriate amounts of
dispersants with ultrasonic mixing at ambient condition. As evidenced from Fig. 9(c),
the supercritical carbon dioxide-assisted method can effectively improve the dispersion
of pigment red 177 particles in PGMEA, and the mean size of the produced dispersoid
meets the requirement (between 100 nm and 200 nm) for industrial applications. Fig.
10 presents the evolution of the mean sizes of samples obtained from the experiments,
whose initial mean sizes were smaller than 200 nm. As shown from the graph, higher
holding temperatures and pressures are favorable to stabilization of the dispersed
particles. The mean sizes of dispersoids prepared from run #27, run #29 - run #32 can
be maintained to be smaller than 200 nm until about 16 to 18 hours after the
preparation. Within this time period, the sizes of the dispersoids are acceptable for
industrial applications.
4. Conclusions
A series of experiments has been conducted in a high-pressure dispersion
apparatus to investigate the dispersion of 1 wt % of pigment red 177 particles in
PGMEA with the aid of supercritical carbon dioxide. It was found that 40 wt % of
Hypermer PS3 and 1 wt % of Zonyl PSO-100 could be a favorable formulation of
dispersants for the particles’dispersion. The dispersion was only slightly affected by
the pressurization rate. However, the holding time of pigment mixtures at elevated

Abstract
Ultra-fine particles of pigment green 36 were prepared with a continuous
supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) apparatus by using quinoline as a solvent and
supercritical carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. A series of precipitation experiments
was conducted at different temperatures, pressures, and the flow rates of the pigment
solution. The vapor-liquid phase boundaries of carbon dioxide + quinoline mixtures
were also measured with a volume-variable phase equilibrium analyzer at temperatures
from 308.2 K to 328.2 K. Mapping the estimated compositions of mixtures in a model
CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) precipitator at the end of pigment solution
injection onto the phase diagram found that the morphology of prepared particles was
mainly governed by the phase behavior of anti-solvent + solvent mixtures.
Nano-particles were obtained as the precipitation loci were manipulated within either
supercritical or superheated vapor region through the SAS process, whereas
micro-metric aggregated ball-like particles were produced as the precipitation loci
passed by the vapor-liquid coexistence region.

Pigment green 36 is one of coloring materials widely used in preparing photo
resists. Nano-particles of this pigment were produced, in the present study, with a
continuous SAS apparatus using quinoline as a solvent and supercritical carbon
dioxide as an anti-solvent. The experiments were conducted at various flow rates of
pigment solutions over temperatures ranging from 308.2 K to 328.2 K and pressures
up to 31 MPa. The collected particles samples were analyzed with a field emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and the PSD and the mean sizes of particles
were then determined with an image processing software. Since the phase behavior
played an important role in the SAS precipitation, the vapor-liquid phase boundaries
(bubble and dew points), including near critical region, were also measured in this
study with the volume-variable phase equilibrium analyzer for carbon dioxide +
quinoline at 308.2 K, 318.2 K, and 328.2 K over a wide range of pressures. The
composition variations of fluid mixtures in the precipitator during the courses of
injection and purge stages were estimated from a simple continuously stirred tank
reactor (CSTR) model, and the calculated precipitation loci were mapped onto the
phase diagram of carbon dioxide + quinoline to examine the influence of the phase
behavior on the resultant pigment particles.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Pigment green 36 (Cu-phthalocyanine, halogenated) was supplied by Ciba
Special Chemicals Co., Hong Kong. Its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1. The
particle sizes of the pigment as received distribute in the range of 1 m to 20 m.
Quinoline (purity of 99.9 %, spectrophotometric grade) was purchased from Aldrich
(USA) and carbon dioxide (purity of 99.8 %) from Liu-Hsiang Gas Co., Taiwan. These
chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Apparatus and operation
A volume-variable phase equilibrium analyzer was utilized to investigate the
phase boundary (bubble and dew points) of the binary mixtures of carbon dioxide +
quinoline. The apparatus and the experimental procedure have been detailed elsewhere
[1]. The uncertainties of measurements are 0.1 K, 0.05 MPa, and 0.003 for
temperature, pressure, and composition in mole fraction, respectively.
30
the extremely minute solubility of pigment green 36 in supercritical carbon dioxide,
the phase behavior of the mixtures in the precipitator should be very similar to that of
the mixtures without containing the pigment, i.e., the binary mixtures of carbon
dioxide + quinoline [6]. The vapor-liquid phase boundaries (including dew points and
bubble points) of the binary system of carbon dioxide + quinoline were thus measured
with the volume-variable phase equilibrium analyzer over a temperature range of 308.2
K to 328.2 K and up to critical pressures. Fig. 2 illustrates the experimental results in
which xCO2 stands for the mole fraction of carbon dioxide. This phase diagram is
divided into four phase regions, including vapor-liquid coexistence (V-L), compressed
liquid (L), superheated vapor (V), and supercritical (SC) regions. The critical pressure
and composition at each temperature were estimated from the maximum point of the
smoothed isothermal phase boundary near the critical region. The estimated critical
points are located at 308.2 K/23.9 MPa/xCO2 = 0.843, 318.2 K/25.3 MPa/xCO2 = 0.842,
and 328.2 K/26.9 MPa/xCO2 = 0.842, respectively.
3.2. Influence of phase behavior on morphology of resultant particles
The precipitation experiments were conducted at different volumetric flow rates
of pigment solution (F, from 0.0100 cm3/s to 0.0667 cm3/s), precipitation temperatures
(T, from 308.2 K to 328.2 K), and precipitation pressures (P, from 20 MPa to 31 MPa),
but the concentration of the injected pigment solution was fixed at 0.08 kg/m3 through
all the experimental runs due to the low solubility of pigment green 36 in quinoline.
The experimental conditions and the results are reported in Table 1, where the densities
of carbon dioxide at precipitation temperature and pressure were taken from the NIST
Chemistry WebBook [11].
The composition variations of fluid mixtures in the precipitation chamber during
the SAS process were calculated, in this study, from unsteady-state material balance
equations around the precipitator. The estimated results can be mapped onto the phase
diagram of carbon dioxide + quinoline to identify the phase regions being passed
during the SAS procedure. Similar to the work of Schmitt et al. [12], the precipitator
was assumed as a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with two inlet and one
outlet streams. With the initial condition of pure carbon dioxide (zCO2 = 1.0, where zCO2
is the mass fraction of carbon dioxide) at the beginning of injection of pigment

horizontal dashed line twice. It means that the fluid mixtures in the precipitator passed
by the vapor-liquid coexistence region during the SAS process. While the mixing in
precipitator was non-ideal, the actual minimum concentration of carbon dioxide xoCO2
should be lower than the value calculated from eq (1).
The estimated minimum concentrations of carbon dioxide xoCO2, at the end of
pigment solution injection, were marked on Figs. 4, 5, and 6 for the experiments
conducted at 308.2 K, 318.2 K and 328.2 K, respectively. The horizontal dashed line
stands for the critical pressure at the precipitation temperature and the solid curve for
the vapor-liquid phase boundary. The particles formation occurred in the supercritical
region, if the points are above the horizontal dashed line, such as runs #1, #3 to #6, #10
to #13 (in Fig. 4), run #15 (in Fig. 5), and run #16 (in Fig. 6). The precipitation and
purge stages were operated in the superheated vapor regions, if the points are located
under the horizontal dashed line but well behind the right hand side of the vapor-liquid
phase boundaries, such as run #2 (in Fig. 4), runs #8 and #14 (in Fig. 5), and run #9 (in
Fig. 6). In the case of the points located on the left hand side or near the phase
boundaries, such as run #17 (in Fig. 4), run #18 (in Fig. 5), and runs #19 and #20 (in
Fig. 6), the SAS procedure was likely to crossing the vapor-liquid coexistence region.
Although the estimated minimum compositions of carbon dioxide of runs #17 and #20
are located in the superheated vapor region, actually these runs should pass by the
two-phase coexistence region at the end of pigment solution injection because the
recovered quinoline from the separator was found to turn into greenish. As noted
earlier, this discrepancy may be attributed to the non-ideal mixing in the precipitator.
Fig. 7 shows the FESEM images of the samples prepared in the vapor-liquid
coexistence region (run #18, Fig. 7(a)), in the supercritical region (run #10, Fig. 7(b)),
and in superheated vapor region (run #14, Fig. 7(c)), respectively. Fig. 8 is the
corresponding enlarged FESEM images. As seen from the images, the shape of the
resultant primary particles of pigment green 36 is near sphere. The images also
illustrate that micron-metric aggregated ball-like particles were formed when the SAS
process passed by the vapor-liquid coexistence region. Nano-metric and less
aggregated pigment particles were produced when the SAS process was operated in
either supercritical or superheated vapor region. In the former case serious
34
concentrations of fluid mixtures in the precipitator during the SAS process can be
estimated by a simple CSTR model. The vapor-liquid equilibrium phase diagram
together with this CSTR model provides valuable information for manipulating the
particulate products. The experimental results also showed that higher densities of
fluid mixtures in the precipitator may be favorable to reduce the particle size of the
resultant products.

1. Introduction
Ultra-fine and monodispersed polymeric particles have a wide variety of
applications in many industries. For example, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
particles, which possess excellent optical, electrical and biocompatible properties, can
be used as spacers in the fabrication of liquid crystal displays or as additives in
cosmetics [1]. The metallocene cyclic olefin copolymer (mCOC) is an engineering
polymer that has low dielectric constant, high transparency and high glass transition
temperature [2]. Due the excellent thermal properties of mCOC, even better than those
of PMMA, ultra-fine mCOC particles are expected to be applied to optical and
electronic areas in the near future [3]. The aim of this study is to investigate the
micronization process for preparing ultra-fine mCOC particles with supercritical CO2.
In the last decade, several supercritical fluid-assisted methods have been developed to
prepare fine particles. Among the methods, rapid expansion of supercritical solutions
(RESS) [4], particles from gas-saturated solutions (PGSS) [5], and supercritical
anti-solvent (SAS) [6, 7] have been developed. For the SAS apparatuses with different
designs, several designations have been given, for examples, aerosol solvent extraction
system (ASES) [8], solution enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDS) [9],
and precipitation by compressed antisolvent (PCA) [10]. Jung and Perrut [11],
Reverchon [12], and Reverchon and Adami [13] have discussed progress of the
research. Because of the low solubility of polymeric materials in supercritical fluids,
the SAS method was adopted in the present study to prepare ultra-fine mCOC
particles.
A series of investigations for polymeric materials with PCA method has been
conducted by the research group of Johnston [14-16]. Among these studies, Dixon et al.
[14, 15] produced polystyrene (PS) microspheres and fibers by spraying polymer
solutions into liquid carbon dioxide. Spherical PS particles with diameters from 0.1 μm 
to 20 μm were formed while 1 wt % of PS in toluene solution was charged into the
high pressure vessel under different temperatures and pressures. In their experiments,
the densities of carbon dioxide were manipulated in the range of 0.13 to 0.86 g/cm3.
When the polymer concentrations were higher than a specific composition, the
morphology of the PS products changed from spherical particles into micorporous
fibers and oriented fibrils. Mawson et al. [16] designed a coaxial nozzle to enhance the
48
A lab scale continuous SAS apparatus (model: SAS 200) was purchased from
Thar Technologies Co., USA. Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagram, in which the
injection device has been modified by our research group. This apparatus consists of
three major parts: feeding, precipitation, and separation units. The polymer solution
was delivered by a high pressure pump (11, P2) and had a maximum flow rate of 30
g/min. Carbon dioxide (1) flowed through a filter (2) (model: OT3-2 Agilent, USA), a
cooler (3), and then was charged with another high pressure pump (11, P1) that had a
maximum flow rate of 200 g/min. Its flow rate was measured by a mass flow meter (4)
(model: RHM03, Rheonik, Germany) to an accuracy of ± 0.5 %. Before entering a
coaxial injector (9), carbon dioxide was heated up to about precipitation temperature
by a preheater (6). The coaxial injector was composed of a 0.3175 cm (OD) stainless
steel tube with an insert of PEEK capilary tube (inside diameter of 254 μm, Victrex, 
UK). While the polymer solution was sprayed into a precipitator (10) via the capillary
tube, carbon dioxide was diverted through the stainless steel tube outside the capillary
tube. The precipitator was a stainless steel high-pressure vessel with an inside
diameters of 7.62 cm, a length of 57.15 cm and an internal volume of 2000 cm3. This
precipitation chamber was heated with an outer heated jacket (8) and operable up to 60
MPa and 423.2 K. A pressure transducer (14) (model: PDCR 910, up to 50 MPa, Druck,
UK) with a digital indicator (model: DPI-261, Druck, UK) measured the operating
pressure in the precipitator. The pressure in the chamber was controlled by a back
pressure regulator (13). A metal frit (5) with a pore size of 0.5 m was installed at the
bottom of the precipitator to collect the produced particles. The mixture of the solvent
and the anti-solvent, passing through the metal frit, was transferred into a cyclone
separator (12) at lower pressures to separate the solvent and the anti-solvent. The
separator had an outside diameter of 7.62 cm, an inside diameter of 5.41 cm and an
internal volume of 500 cm3. This vessel was useable at pressures up to 10 MPa and
temperatures up to 373.2 K. The separator temperature was manipulated with a heating
jacket (8). The operation of the SAS apparatus was monitored by a personal computer
(7) and all the experimental conditions were specified via an operation menu with the
aid of built-in software.
2.2 Materials
50
(JSM-6500F JEOL, Japan). The mean particles size and the PSD of the primary
particles were determined with Sigma Scan Pro 5 software. At least 300 particles were
counted from an FESEM image to determine PSD. The residual solvent in the samples
of mCOC particles, if any, was detected with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA)
(TGD-7000H SinkuRiko, Japan). During the TGA analysis, the samples were heated at
a fixed heating rate (10 K/min) from 298.2 K to 873.2 K. The glass transition behavior
of mCOC particulate samples was observed with DSC (DSC-2010 TA Instruments,
USA). Each sample, about 1 mg, was heated at a temperature increment of 10 K/min
from 298.2 K to 453.2 K.
3. Results and Discussions
The SAS apparatus, as described above, was used in the present study to explore
the influence of various experimental parameters on the morphology, the mean size
and the PSD of the prepared samples. Table 1 lists the operating conditions of the
experiments and the corresponding experimental results. The significance of each
investigated factor is discussed as follows.
3.1 Effect of character of CO2 injector
Two different injection systems were used in the SAS process to investigate the
influence of character of carbon dioxide injector on the resulting particles. In the
original design, carbon dioxide and polymer solution were diverted individually into
the precipitator, polymer solution from the top of the vessel and carbon dioxide from
the radial direction of the vessel. This type of injection unit has been named as the
aerosol solvent extraction system (ASES) [8]. A coaxial injector, which consisted of a
straight tee with an insert of 254 μm capilary tube to enhance the mass transfer 
between the injected supercritical fluid and polymer solution, was replaced the original
one. It is known as the solution enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDS),
first developed by Hanna [22]. A series of experiments, which is given as runs # 1 to
#12 in Table 1, was conducted with two different injection units of carbon dioxide. Fig.
3 compares the mean sizes of primary particles obtained from this series of runs under
precipitation pressures ranging from 7 MPa to 15 MPa. Smaller particles were
obtained by using the coaxial injector over the entire pressure range. At pressures
lower than 8.5 MPa, the mean sizes of the particles from the ASES were larger than
those from the SEDS by about 50 nm. At precipitation pressures higher than 10 MPa,
52
the metal frit (at the bottom of precipitator). While the precipitations were operated in
the supercritical region, nanoparticles with narrow distribution were produced and the
particles were found not only on the metal frit but also on the inner surfaces of the
precipitator.
3.3 Effect of precipitation temperature
The precipitation experiments were also conducted at various temperatures, from
298.2 K to 343.2 K, for investigating the temperature-effect on the particulate products.
In this series of runs, including runs #10, #12, #14, #17, and #19 to #25, the
precipitation pressures were at 10 MPa or 15 MPa and the concentration of mCOC in
toluene was 1 wt % with the polymer solution flow rate of 5 g/min. The mean sizes of
the primary particles produced at different precipitation temperatures are shown in Fig.
8, indicating that larger mCOC particles were formed at higher temperatures, which
may be attributed to the growth rate of particles increased with an increase of
temperature [25]. The FESEM images of samples taken from this series of runs are
presented in Figs. 9(a) to 9(d) and Figs. 10(a) to 10(d). At precipitation temperatures as
high as 343.2 K, primary particles appear to be seriously fused together as shown in
Figs. 9(d) and 10(d). Although the intrinsic glass transition temperature (Tg) of the
mCOC is about 404 K, its Tg may be depressed down to below 343.2 K in the presence
of carbon dioxide at elevated pressures [26]. As a consequence, the polymeric mCOC
materials were likely in a fluidity state during the precipitation stage, leading to the
serious agglomeration of the final products. In this series of experiments, the
precipitation conditions of run #22 (298.2 K and 15 MPa), run #23 (306.2 K and 15
MPa) and run #14 (333.2 K and 10 MPa) are located in the compressed liquid, the
supercritical, and the vapor-liquid coexistence regions of carbon dioxide + toluene
system, respectively. Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) show that uniform nanoparticles were
obtained from either homogeneous compressed liquid or homogeneous supercritical
region, whereas extraordinarily large particles were produced from the two-phase
coexistence region as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). The importance of the phase behavior in
the SAS process is evident from the influence of both precipitation pressure and
temperature on the morphology of the resulting products.
3.4 Effect of anti-solvent density
As discussed above, the mean size of particulate products are sensitive to
54
3.6 Effect of nature of organic solvents
Kröber et al. [29] demonstrated the manipulation of tartaric acid particles by
using different organic solvents in the SAS process. In this study, toluene was adopted
as a solvent because it was often used in the industrial chemical process for synthesis
of mCOC. In addition to toluene, several other solvents were also tested. These
solvents included the isomers of xylene and THF. All of this series of precipitation
experiments, runs #12 and #36 to #39, were conducted at 313.2 K and 15 MPa to
ensure the mixtures in the precipitator were at a homogeneous supercritical state
during the particles formation stage. It was found that nanoparticles were produced by
using any one of the tested solvents. The mean sizes were distributed in the range of
42.5 nm with THF as a solvent to 53.5 nm with p-xylene as a solvent as shown in
Table 1. It is apparent that the influence of the nature of solvents on the mean particle
size is small if the precipitation conditions are manipulated in the same phase regions.
3.7 Determination of residual solvent
In the micronization processes, special attention has been given to not only the
mean size and the size distribution of primary particles, but also to the amount of
residual solvent left in the final products. TGA was applied in this study to detect any
residual toluene left in the particulate mCOC samples after the SAS process. The
results of TGA analysis show that the unprocessed mCOC sample was beginning to
decompose at about 666.2 K and the weight loss reached to about 100 % at 752.2 K, as
depicted in Fig. 15. The normal boiling point of toluene is 383.2 K, which is far below
the initial decomposition temperature of mCOC. The TGA analysis results as shown in
Fig. 15 also reveal that the mCOC sample after SAS processing has a slight weight
loss by about 1.6 % as temperature reaching 666.2 K. Consequently the residual
toluene in the particulate product should be extremely low.
3.8 Glass transition behaviour
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of mCOC samples was measured with DSC.
The original mCOC sample exhibits a normal glass transistion behavior and its Tg is
about 404 K as shown in Fig. 16. The graph also shows the thermal histograms for the
samples obtained from different precipitation pressures and all these samples were
prepared at T = 313.2 K, and C = 1 wt % solution of mCOC in toluene and F = 5 g/min.
As the precipitation pressure increases from 8 MPa to 20 MPa, the Tg decreases from
56
4 wt %. According to the TGA analysis, the amount of residual solvent was very small
in the mCOC sample after SAS processing. However, sub-glass transition behavior
was exhibited on the thermal histograms of DSC analysis from the mCOC
nanoparticles.

技術/創作名稱 一種分散顏料微粒的方法
發明人/創作人 吳弦聰、李明哲、林河木
中文：一種分散顏料微粒的方法，其係藉由將一顏料與一共聚
物分散劑加入至一溶劑中以形成一混合物，並將該混合
物置入一分散槽後，導入超臨界二氧化碳，使該分散槽
內壓力上升並維持於一預設壓力下，同時使該分散槽內
溫度昇溫並維持在一預設溫度下。待於前述壓力與溫度
下維持一預設時間後，將分散槽中的混合物迅速釋壓至
大氣壓，並移至一接收槽中。其中，該顏料相對於該混
合物的濃度為 0.1~2 wt %，且該共聚物分散劑相對於該
顏料的濃度為 20~60 wt %。
