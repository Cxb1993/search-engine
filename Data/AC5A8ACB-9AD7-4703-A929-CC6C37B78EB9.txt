Abstract (英文摘要) 
As a descendent of the project “the software 
defined radio system chip”, this project will be 
focused on the research and development of receiver 
base-band circuits and frequency synthesizer. 
Decimation filter topology is adopted to realize the 
base-band circuits. Since the data will be sampled 
before entering ADC, the system requirements for 
ADC will be therefore relaxed. On the other hand, 
the filter response will be a function of sampling 
frequency, which means the filter bandwidth can be 
adjusted by manipulating the sampling clock signals. 
For a SDR system, such filter architecture will offer 
great flexibility. As we may need variable clock 
signals for desired filter responses, a clock 
generation circuit providing multi-frequency and 
multi-phase clock signals will be necessary. In this 
project fractional-N frequency synthesizer is 
adopted for local oscillator generation in the 
transceiver. Differentially tuned varactors are used to 
realize VCO for its advantage of common-mode 
noise canceling, which greatly improves the phase 
noise. In order to find a suitable frequency 
synthesizer for SDR transceiver, we intend to apply 
such a VCO in our frequency synthesizer for it 
exhibits both low phase noise and wide tuning range. 
Other VCO configurations, like VCOs with a 
transformer-C tank are invetigated. By combining 
the bias voltage of the current flowing in the 
transformer and the control voltage of varactor, the 
proposed VCO can offer even wider tuning range. 
The proposed VCO can also employ the 
differentially tuned varactor as an alternative so that 
it can provide wide tuning range with good phase 
noise performances. 
 
Key words: software defined radio, decimation filter, 
frequency synthesizer.

Fig. 1.1 The block diagram of a fractional-N frequency 
synthesizer. 
The VCO provides a tuning range of 6.8-10 GHz; 
therefore, the synthesizer can deliver frequency 
ranges of 3.4-5 GHz, 1.7-2.5 GHz, and 0.85-1.25 
GHz through the three divide-by-two circuits. 
Notably, two of the divide-by-two circuits are 
included in the divider chain to make a compromise 
between the power consumption and the 
quantization noise.  
A. Charge Pump 
The charge pump current ICP is an important 
parameter of a PLL. It relates to many 
characteristics such as the damping ratio ζ, the 
natural frequency ωn, and the loop bandwidth of the 
PLL. The loop bandwidth can be expressed as: 
N
RKIbandwidthloop VCOCP 2⋅⋅≈                   (1) 
, where N is the ratio of the carrier frequency to the 
reference frequency, KVCO is the gain of the VCO, 
and R2 is one of components of the loop filter. Over 
the entire frequency range of the wideband 
synthesizer, the variation of the number N and the 
gain KVCO could be extremely large. According to 
(1), either the value of ICP or the loop filter 
component R2 can be dynamically adjusted to 
achieve a fixed loop bandwidth and a desired locked 
time. Therefore, a dynamic charge pump current ICP 
is adopted to keep the loop bandwidth constant over 
the entire tuning range of the synthesizer in this 
work. The adopted ICP within different frequency 
range is shown in Fig. 1.2, where the required 
minimum and maximum of ICP are 0.2 mA and 1.2 
mA. The dynamic charge pump current can be 
implemented with a 7-bit current steer digital to 
analog converter (DAC) which provides an output 
current range of 0~1.27 mA and achieves a fine 
resolution of 10 uA, around twentieth the minimum 
ICP. 
 
Fig. 1.2 The adopted ICP versus VCO frequency. 
B. VCO 
There exist more difficulties in the design of the 
VCO than in other components of the synthesizer, 
especially when it is for an SDR. The VCO must 
provide a very wide tuning range and present low 
phase noise, required by wireless communication 
systems of interest. CMOS LC VCOs with turning 
ranges around 50% have been reported [4]-[7], 
where switch-capacitor arrays are adopted and 
digital control circuits is required to perform the 
frequency band pre-selection.  
In this work, differentially-tuned varactors are 
adopted to implement the high-gain LC VCO. The 
architecture with differentially-tuned varactors can 
minimize the common mode noise from high-gain 
varactors for VCOs with wide tuning ranges [4-5]. 
The schematic of the differentially -tuned VCO is 
shown in Fig. 1.3. The complementary MOS 
cross-coupled pairs provide the negative 
transconductance (gm) for the VCO, where the tail 
current source is absent as it can contribute 
considerable phase noise to the high-gain VCO 
through the AM-to-FM mechanism. As shown in Fig. 
1.3, a common-source amplifier plays the role of a 
voltage converter whose input and output voltages 
are both applied to control the varactors to achieve

Fig. 1.5 shows the spectra of the 4.99-GHz 
output signals obtained from the divide-by-two 
circuit, where the 24-MHz reference spurs is -68 
dBc at the integer-mode. Fig. 1.6 shows the 
measured VCO tuning range and the corresponding 
KVCO around different frequencies for a given 
controlled voltage range from 0.4 V to 1.3 V. The 
entire tuning range is from 6.8 GHz to 10 GHz (38.8 
%).

The achieved locked times of the frequency 
synthesizer at different operation modes are listed in 
Table I. In general, the synthesized signals can settle 
to the desired values with 15-ppm error within 11 us. 
The experimental results are summarized in Table II 
and the chip microphotograph is shown in Fig. 1.7. 
According to the measurement results, the BFM of 
the proposed SDR frequency synthesizer is -211 
dBc/Hz and -199 dBc/Hz at the integer mode and 
the fraction mode, respectively.

3. 類比基頻電路 II 
A complex band-pass filter, as the key building 
block for low-IF SDR receivers, is studied and 
implemented in this work. A complex band-pass 
filter with a bandwidth of ωC and a center frequency 
of ω0 can be obtained from shifting the frequency 
response of a low-pass filter (LPF) with a bandwidth 
of 0.5ωC by ω0[8]. In this work, a 6th-order complex 
BPF is obtained by cascading three 2nd-order 
complex BPFs, each of which is formed from a gm-C 
LPF through the frequency shifting. The schematic 
of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) 
used in the gm-C filter is shown in Fig. 3.1. The OTA 
employs a feed-forward structure consisting of M5-12 
to stabilize the output common mode voltage [9]. A 
raise in the common-mode voltage at out1 would 
cause a decline at the output of the inverter INV3, 
which can be used to cancel the raise in the 
common-mode voltage at out2. Similarly, the raise in 
the common-mode voltage at out1 can be cancelled 
by the induced voltage decline at the output of the 
inverter INV5.  
The 2nd-oder complex BPF is depicted in Fig. 
3.2, where a biquad LPF is formed from gm1, gm2, C1 
and the gyrator-C (gm3−4 and C2). A gyrator is 
inserted between the output nodes of two biquad 
LPFs, while another gyrator is inserted between the 
contained RC networks (gm2 and C1), to translate the 
low-pass frequency response to the complex 
band-pass response. Note that gm2, C1 and the 
gyrator-C effectively construct an RLC network and 
the transfer function of the LPF, TLPF (s), can be 
expressed as:

Note that the bandwidth of the complex BPF

to support a variety of wireless technologies, the 
BPF must achieve variable bandwidths from 
hundreds of kHz to tenths of MHz. The tunable 
bandwidth is realized by adjustable OTAs and 
capacitors. In this work, the filter operates in a 
narrow-band mode and a wide-band mode, where

The VCO provides a tuning range of 6.8-10 GHz; therefore, 
the synthesizer can deliver frequency ranges of 3.4-5 GHz, 
1.7-2.5 GHz, and 0.85-1.25 GHz through the three 
divide-by-two circuits. Notably, two of the divide-by-two 
circuits are included in the divider chain to make a 
compromise between the power consumption and the 
quantization noise.  
A. Charge Pump 
The charge pump current ICP is an important parameter of a PLL. 
It relates to many characteristics such as the damping ratio ζ, the 
natural frequency ωn, and the loop bandwidth of the PLL. The loop 
bandwidth can be expressed as: 
N
RKIbandwidthloop VCOCP 2⋅⋅≈                   (1) 
, where N is the ratio of the carrier frequency to the reference 
frequency, KVCO is the gain of the VCO, and R2 is one of 
components of the loop filter. Over the entire frequency range of the 
wideband synthesizer, the variation of the number N and the gain 
KVCO could be extremely large. According to (1), either the value of 
ICP or the loop filter component R2 can be dynamically adjusted to 
achieve a fixed loop bandwidth and a desired locked time. Therefore, 
a dynamic charge pump current ICP is adopted to keep the loop 
bandwidth constant over the entire tuning range of the synthesizer in 
this work. The adopted ICP within different frequency range is 
shown in Fig. 2, where the required minimum and maximum 
of ICP are 0.2 mA and 1.2 mA. The dynamic charge pump 
current can be implemented with a 7-bit current steer digital 
to analog converter (DAC) which provides an output current 
range of 0~1.27 mA and achieves a fine resolution of 10 uA, 
around twentieth the minimum ICP. 
 
 
Fig.2 The adopted ICP versus VCO frequency. 
B. VCO 
There exist more difficulties in the design of the VCO than 
in other components of the synthesizer, especially when it is 
for an SDR. The VCO must provide a very wide tuning range 
and present low phase noise, required by wireless 
communication systems of interest. CMOS LC VCOs with 
turning ranges around 50% have been reported [4]-[7], where 
switch-capacitor arrays are adopted and digital control 
circuits is required to perform the frequency band 
pre-selection.  
In this work, differentially-tuned varactors are adopted to 
implement the high-gain LC VCO. The architecture with 
differentially-tuned varactors can minimize the common 
mode noise from high-gain varactors for VCOs with wide 
tuning ranges [4-5]. The schematic of the differentially -tuned 
VCO is shown in Fig. 3. The complementary MOS 
cross-coupled pairs provide the negative transconductance 
(gm) for the VCO, where the tail current source is absent as it 
can contribute considerable phase noise to the high-gain 
VCO through the AM-to-FM mechanism. As shown in Fig. 3, 
a common-source amplifier plays the role of a voltage 
converter whose input and output voltages are both applied to 
control the varactors to achieve the differential tuning. 
Notably, a capacitor at the output of the voltage converter is 
required to suppress the flicker noise contribution from the 
PMOS.    
 
 
Fig. 3 The schematic of the differentially-tuned VCO. 
C. DSM 
The fractional-N synthesizer employs a 24-bit 
third-order mash-type DSM for high-pass noise shaping. 
Conventionally, a MASH3 DSM is a cascade of three 
accumulators of the same bit size. However, the second and 
the third stages require fewer bits than the first one does to 
deal with the quantization noise. Therefore, the sizes of the 
second and the third accumulators can be simplified to 16 bits 
and 8 bits, respectively. In this way, the hardware of the 
DSM can be reduced by 1/3, that is, the chip area of the 
third-order DSM can be the same as that of a second-order 
one. Moreover, 8-bit accumulators are inserted as delay units 
to deal with the carry delay issue. 
III. MEASUREMENT AND DISCUSSIONS  
The proposed synthesizer is implemented using 90-nm 
CMOS technology. The VCO and the charge pump together 
draw 26 mW from a 1.5-V supply while the rest part 
dissipates 33 mW from a 1.2-V supply, corresponding to a 
total power consumption of 59 mW. As mentioned in Sec II, 
each SCL divide-by-two circuit is followed by a buffer which 
dissipates 4.8 mW from the 1.2 V supply. The high-power 
buffer can provide sufficient driving capability during the 
measurement, which may be unnecessary in practical use. 
Therefore, the required power consumption of the synthesizer 
is possibly 45 mW in the real situation.

Fig. 7 The chip microphotograph. 
 
Phase noises of VCOs and frequency synthesizers have 
been discussed in numerous studies [12]-[14]. Banerjee 
claims that the in-band phase noise LPLL_in-band is in proportion 
to the square of the divide ratio N (of the divider) and the 
frequency of the reference clock fref given at the PFD input 
[14]. The relationship can be described by the following 
formula as:      
refbandinPLL fNL ⋅∝− 2_               (3) 
Therefore, a normalized phase noise PN1Hz is proposed to 
evaluate the quality of a phase-lock-loop, i.e.:

The Banerjee model was applied to a variety of PLL-based 
frequency synthesizers in previous studies, where the 
normalized phase noise PN1Hz is used as the FOM for PLLs, 
called BFM. According to the measurement results, the BFM 
of the proposed SDR frequency synthesizer is -211 dBc/Hz 
and -199 dBc/Hz at the integer mode and the fraction mode, 
respectively. 
IV. SUMMARY 
The design and implementation of a PLL-based CMOS 
frequency synthesizer are described. The synthesizer employs 
the fractional-N architecture to achieve a fine frequency 
resolution while adopting a wide loop bandwidth for short 
locked times. The synthesizer was fabricated in a 90-nm 
CMOS process and occupied a chip area of 0.95 mm2. 
Adopting the differentially-tuned topology, its VCO achieves 
a wide tuning range of 38.8 % while exhibiting a phase noise 
of -110 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from the carrier frequency of 
5 GHz. The synthesizer can provide carriers in the frequency 
bands of 3.4-5 GHz, 1.7-2.5 GHz, and 0.85-1.25 GHz at a 
power consumption of 59 mW. Although the wide frequency 
range leads to very large variations in both the divide ratio N 
and the VCO gain KVCO, the charge pump current can be 
dynamically adjusted to maintain a constant loop bandwidth, 
which can be realized by using a current-mode DAC to 
provide a programmable charge pump current. Therefore, the 
synthesizer can achieve short locked times around 10 us in 
each frequency band. At the frequency band of 4.99 GHz, the 
synthesizer can achieve BFMs of -211 dBc/Hz and -199 
dBc/Hz at the integer mode and the fraction mode, 
respectively.

Abstract—A 6.8-10 GHz fractional-N frequency synthesizer 
for the software-defined-radio is presented in 90-nm CMOS 
technology. Differentially tuned varactors are employed to 
achieve a VCO with a wide tuning range and low phase noise. 
The charge pump current is varied to optimize the loop 
bandwidth over the entire VCO tuning range from 6.8 GHz to 
10 GHz. The power dissipation of the synthesizer chip is 59 mW. 
The synthesizer achieves the close-in phase noise of -91 dBc/Hz 
and the reference spur of -68 dBc at the integer-N mode. The 
synthesizer can settle to the desired frequency within 10~11 us 
in each application band while offering a frequency resolution of 
3 Hz.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, portable devices embedded with a variety of 
wireless technologies are drawing attention. With powerful 
micro-processors and programs, such devices can be flexibly 
adjusted as the software to provide variable wireless services 
operating within a wide frequency range (ex: 0.8~5.0 GHz), 
which introduces the concept of a software-defined-radio 
(SDR) [1-3]. SDR portable devices can be implemented with 
either wide-band transceivers or multi-band transceivers, 
where frequency synthesizers are required to offer wide-band 
carriers with low phase noise to cover all the popular wireless 
standards from 0.8 to 5.0 GHz, such as GSM, DCS, PCS, 
Bluetooth, WCDMA, WLAN 802.11a/b/g and WiMAX 
802.16e.   
In addition to supporting many wireless technologies, SDR 
portable devices need to be small, light and cheap to gain 
competitive advantages in the market. The number of the 
internal building blocks and the external components of a 
transceiver should be minimized. The best solution may be 
the direct conversion architecture, where issues such as LO 
self-mixing and LO pulling are often resolved by operating 
the oscillator at twice the radio frequency. Therefore, the 
frequency synthesizer needs to provide a frequency range 
around 6-12 GHz to generate the desired carrier frequencies 
for wireless standards mentioned above. In the previous 
works, more than one voltage-controlled- oscillators (VCOs) 
are used in the frequency synthesizer since it is difficult to 
achieve a wide tuning range by using only one VCO [2-3]. 
However, the LC-tanks of the VCOs occupy large chip area, 
which may raise the manufacturing cost. Studies on VCOs 
presenting wide tuning range and low phase noise are then 
drawing our attention [4-7]. 
For a frequency synthesizer employing the integer-N 
phase-locked-loop (PLL) architecture, the loop bandwidth 
and the frequency resolution are closely interrelated. 
Approaches that enable a synthesizer to achieve fine 
frequency resolution and fast locking are necessary [8-9]. 
Fortunately, the fractional-N PLL architecture allows 
frequency steps far smaller than the reference frequency. A 
wide loop bandwidth can be adopted, which helps reduce the 
settling time of a PLL [10]. 
In this work, a VCO with differentially-tuned varactors is 
firstly employed in a fractional-N synthesizer which can 
provide the wide-band carrier for SDR transceivers based on 
the direct conversion architecture. The rest of the paper is 
organized as follows. Sec II describes the design of each 
building block of the frequency synthesizer. Sec III reports 
the experimental results of the frequency synthesizer along 
with discussions. Finally, Sec IV summarizes this work in 
brief. 
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN 
Fig. 1 depicts the block diagram of a fractional-N 
synthesizer which consists of a crystal oscillator, a voltage 
controlled oscillator (VCO), a charge pump phase/ frequency 
detector (CP-PFD), a loop filter, a MASH3 
delta-sigma-modulator (DSM) and dividers, including a 
programmable divider and three divide-by-two circuits. Both 
the 3rd-order loop filter and the crystal oscillator are 
implemented with off-chip elements in this work.

The phase noises of the synthesized carrier signals were 
measured with the R&S® Signal Source Analyzer FSUP26. 
Fig. 4 shows the measured phase noises of the 4.99-GHz 
output signals from a divide-by-two circuit, where the 
close-in results are -91 dBc/Hz and -78.8 dBc/Hz at the 
integer mode and the fraction mode, respectively. The 
discrepancy in the close-in phase noises could be due to the 
nonlinearity in the phase detector which causes the 
high-pass-shaped quantization noise to fold down around dc, 
and thus increases the close-in phase noise of the synthesizer. 
Therefore, the linearity of the phase detector in a fractional-N 
synthesizer is far more critical than that in an integer-N one. 
 
Fig. 4 The measured phase noises at carrier frequencies of 4.988 
GHz (integer mode) and 4.968 GHz (fraction mode). 
 
Fig. 5 The measured spectra at carrier frequencies of 4.988 GHz 
(integer mode) and 4.968 GHz (fraction mode). 
 
Fig. 5 shows the spectra of the 4.99-GHz output signals 
obtained from the divide-by-two circuit, where the 24-MHz 
reference spurs is -68 dBc at the integer-mode. Fig. 6 shows 
the measured VCO tuning range and the corresponding KVCO 
around different frequencies for a given controlled voltage 
range from 0.4 V to 1.3 V. The entire tuning range is from 
6.8 GHz to 10 GHz (38.8 %).

The achieved locked times of the frequency synthesizer 
at different operation modes are listed in Table I. In general, 
the synthesized signals can settle to the desired values with 
15-ppm error within 11 us. The experimental results are 
summarized in Table II and the chip microphotograph is 
shown in Fig. 7.
