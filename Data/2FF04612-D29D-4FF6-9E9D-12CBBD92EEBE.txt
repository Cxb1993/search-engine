 Useful information had been provided to engineers according to these studies however more 
efforts are still required. In this numerical study, the authors predict a single pile model in the 
centrifuge model tests by Abdoun et al. [15] using an effective stress analysis, to not only 
compare the predicted responses and the observations but also to investigate the dynamic 
mechanism of the soils surrounding the pile in the shake. 
NUMERICAL METHOD 
The numerical method of the effective stress analysis is briefly described in this section. 
A soil-water coupled problem was formulated based on a u-p formulation (Oka et al., [17]). 
The finite element method (FEM) was used for the spatial discretization of the equilibrium 
equation, while the finite difference method (FDM) was used for the spatial discretization of 
the pore water pressure in the continuity equation. Oka et al. [17] verified the accuracy of the 
proposed numerical method through a comparison of numerical results and analytical 
solutions for transient response of saturated porous solids. The governing equations are 
formulated by the following assumptions; 1) the infinitesimal strain, 2) the smooth 
distribution of porosity in the soil, 3) the small relative acceleration of the fluid phase to that 
of the solid phase compared with the acceleration of the solid phase, 4) incompressible grain 
particles in the soil. The equilibrium equation for the mixture is derived as follows: 
- div - = 0Sρ ρu σ b&&  (1) 
where ρ  is the overall density, Su&&  is the acceleration vector of the solid, σ  is the total 
stress tensor and b  is the body force vector. The continuity equation is derived as follows: 
( )div -grad + - - + = 0F F S Sv F
w
k np ρ ρ ε p
γ K
⎧ ⎫⎪ ⎪⎨ ⎬⎪ ⎪⎩ ⎭
b u&& & &  (2) 
where k  is the coefficient of permeability, wγ  is the unit weight of the fluid, Fρ  is the 
density of the fluid, Svε&  is the volumetric strain rate of the solid, p  is the pore water 
pressure, n  is porosity and FK  is the bulk modulus of the fluid. Newmark implicit 
method was used for time integration. 
The constitutive equation used for sand is a cyclic elasto-plastic model (Oka et al., [16]). 
The constitutive equation is formulated by the following assumptions; 1) the infinitesimal 
strain, 2) the elasto-plastic theory, 3) the non-associated flow rule, 4) the concept of the 
overconsolidated boundary surface, 5) the non-linear kinematic hardening rule. Oka et al. 
[16] discussed the applicability of the constitutive model for cyclic undrained behavior of 
sand through a comparison of numerical results and hollow cylindrical torsional shear tests. 
The model succeeded in reproducing the experimental results well under various stress 
conditions, such as isotropic and anisotropic consolidated conditions, with and without the 
initial shear stress conditions, principal stress axis rotation, etc. 
 
 
 
As to the deformation boundary condition, the bottom of the model was set to be rigid, 
and all lateral boundaries were set to be equal- displacement to both avoid unnecessary echo- 
vibration and simulate the side boundary conditions of the laminar box. The input 
acceleration as shown in Fig 2 was set at the rigid bottom boundary.

acceleration as shown in Fig 2 was set at the rigid bottom boundary. As to the drainage 
boundary condition, the lateral and bottom boundaries were supposed to be impermeable 
while the water table was permeable. The initial stress state was computed by the static 
analysis of which the two degree angle is neglected. Following the first stage, a dynamic 
analysis with keeping internal variables was conducted.

A time integration step of 0.01 second was adopted to ensure the numerical stability. 
The hysteresis damping by the constitutive model was basically used, and Rayleigh damping 
proportional to initial stiffness was used in order to describe the damping especially in the 
high frequency domain. β  and γ  in Newmark method were set to be 0.3025 and 0.6 to 
ensure the numerical stability. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5 (a) and (b) show the responded shear stress of soils in the back of pile and the 
excess pore pressure during a shake in liquefiable soil layer of Sand I and Sand II in two 
layered profile (element a to f in Fig 2). The corresponded excess pore water pressure reaches 
to almost one at around 12 second in sand I and 14 second in Sand II and the soils liquefy. 
Due to liquefaction, the shear stress at x- direction vanishes to almost zero at these times 
from the initial state. It can be observed that after around 2 -3 second later, the shear stress of 
soils at shallow depths increases again and it implies the pile encounters an earth pressure 
again from the soils. It follows a reduction of the excess pore water pressure due to the fact 
that those soils are contracted by the pile. It is seen in Sand I that the increasing lateral 
pressure at the shallow layer reaches the peak value at t=26.6 second when pile head 
displacement reaches the peak value. And the shear stress decreases again while the pile head 
moves backward. The liquefied soils lose their strength to provide earth pressure on the pile 
in some parts of the liquefiable layer. The earth pressure on pile at those moments is provided 
by water pressure. For element g at hard stratum, the deflecting pile induces negative excess 
pore water pressure and some large shear stress responses at some times due to soil dilatancy.
Fig 6 shows the normalized bending moment comparisons at different times. Although 
the deformation of soils in Sand I is greater than in Sand II, however, the corresponded 
bending moment in Sand II is greater. It is because the Sand I is not able to move the pile 
head after fully liquefied but the Sand II with higher liquefaction strength is not fully 
liquefied and therefore pile head is kept being deflected. It also demonstrates that no matter 
the pile is installed in Sand I or Sand II, the largest bending moment occurs at the boundary 
between liquefied and non- liquefied layers. 
Summary and conclusions 
Liquefaction responses of pile head deflection and bending moment of single pile 
installing in a slopping two layered ground is studied by this numerical analysis, of which, 
two types of liquefiable soils, namely Sand I and Sand II are filled in the upper part of the 
ground and non- liquefied soils are filled in the lower part of the ground. Sand I has similar 
liquefaction strength to Dr= 35% Nevada sand and Sand II has much higher liquefaction 
strength than the others.  
This numerical analysis has investigated the responses of soils in the back of pile, pile 
head deflection and bending moment distribution. The numerical results showed that 1) The 
liquefiable layer dominated the responses of pile head deflection and the corresponded 
bending moment, 2) the side boundary in this numerical simulation is more extendable than 
the physical test and predicts greater values of bending moment and deformation, 3) the pile 
head deflection decreases while the surrounding soil starts to fail due to shaking in Sand I, 4) 
While pile head moves backward, the pile head encounters an passive earth pressure from 
soils in the back in Sand I, 5) the pile head deflection keeps increasing while the surrounding 
soils have stronger resistance against liquefaction in Sand II, 6) the greater bending moment 
occurs at the soil boundary.

4.   FEM MODEL 
Figure 2 shows the meshes for the numerical simulation. The soils 
are modeled with 8-node isoparametric solid elements. It contains 
1836 nodes and 1341 elements. Figure 2 also presents the three 
types of soil profiles in the numerical analysis, namely DDL、
DLD、LDD. Of which, D represents relative dense sand layer and L 
represents relative loose sand layer. Each layer is 3m thick.  
The authors use the cyclic elasto-plastic model for all soil layers. 
The elements below the water table are treated as fully saturated 
elements with DOF (Degree Of Freedom) of pore water pressure.

5.   BOUNDARY CONDATIONS 
As to the deformation boundary condition, the bottom of the model 
is set to be rigid. And the lateral boundaries are set to be into three 
types, including equal- displacement boundary condition, namely 
EB, fixed boundary condition, namely FIX, and roller at z direction 
and the rests are fixed, namely Z-Roller. EB condition is used to 
avoid unnecessary echo- vibration and sometimes is to simulate the 
side boundary conditions of the laminar box in a physical test. 
However, in some physical tests, the soil container is with rigid side 
wall, therefore, responses due to lateral side conditions with FIX and 
Z- Roller is necessary to investigate.  
The input acceleration history as shown in Figure 3 is set at the rigid 
bottom boundary. The seismic wave used is sine wave with 
frequency 1.5Hz and magnitude 200 gal as [1]. As to the drainage 
boundary condition, the lateral and bottom boundaries are supposed 
to be impermeable while the water table was permeable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3  Input wave 
 
6.   INITIAL CONDITIONS 
The initial stress state is computed by a gravity analysis with the 
dam sitting on the soil strata. Following the first stage, a dynamic 
analysis with keeping internal variables is conducted. 
 
7.   OTHER NUMERICAL CONDITIONS 
A time integration step of 0.01 second is adopted to ensure the 
numerical stability. The hysteresis damping by the constitutive 
model is basically used, and Rayleigh damping proportional to 
initial stiffness is used in order to describe the damping especially in 
the high frequency domain. β  and γ  in Newmark method are set 
to be 0.3025 and 0.6 to ensure the numerical stability. 
 
8.   RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS 
In this analysis, many conditions have been involved and a great 
amount of figures and tables are draw. However, due to the page 
limitations in this conference, selected figures are shown for some 
important information and the rest of the discussions will be 
possibly carried out in some other paper later on.  
Figure 4 shows the build-up pore water pressure during a shake in 
DDL at FIX. It can be seen that significant pore pressure is induced 
during a shake at loose layer underlying the bottom of the ground. 
And after shake, the pore pressure starts to decrease due to post- 
liquefaction consolidation. Figure 5 demonstrates the corresponding 
settlement in the same condition as Figure 4. The top of the earth 
structure settles the most, followed by the middle of the earth, the 
toe and the soils at far field. And the after shake settlement occurs 
most at the top of earth structures too. The soil at far field settles not 
significantly due to a possible reason that the pore pressure 
dissipation is not yet fully complete. This study shows the time 
period of 25 sec. shaking and 25 sec. consolidation as [1].  
Figure 6 shows horizontal movement of several locations in DDL at 
different boundary conditions. The large displacement difference 
occurs at each soil boundary below the earth structure due to the 
strong earth structure responses, and develops mostly in loose sand 
layer in the free field although the value is much smaller. It also 
shows the earth structure triggers the great movement in this system.  
Figure 7 demonstrates vertical settlement at 25sec. and 50 sec at 
each boundary condition, respectively. It can be seen that the major 
displacement occurring in the loose sand layer and the predicted 
settlement in EB shows a greater value than the rests because 
disturbances from the boundary is not shown.  
Figure 8 presents the settlement below dam and at far field. It is 
found that the earth structure settles the most in LDD. Earth 
structures in DLD have a relative good seismic stability against 
liquefaction induced settlement.

9.   CONCLUSIONS 
Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of the numerical 
analysis in this paper. The dynamic responses of the earth structure 
induce the occurrence of liquefaction in three types of ground. A 
greater settlement of the earth structure is investigated in the LDD 
soil profile although the much liquefaction occurs in DDL. DLD 
provides a better seismic stability to this earth structure. Simulations 
at all the boundary condition show a similar result in predicting 
movement of earth structure, pore water pressure development, and 
responded acceleration of ground surface and earth structure. But 
boundary condition of equil- displacement provides a better 
numerical boundary to the earth structure for settlement 
development in this analysis.
