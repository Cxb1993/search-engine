Abstract
The formation of intermetallic compounds in the coatings inhibits grain growth at high
temperature environment. The current work presents Ta-Ru and Cr-Ru coatings with a Cr or Ti
interlayer on cemented carbide substrates and silicon wafers deposited by direct current
magnetron co-sputtering at 400 oC. The annealing treatments were carried out at 600 oC. The
as-deposited Ta-Ru coatings possessed a hardness of 13–14 GPa and a surface roughness of
1.3–4.0 nm. After annealing in vacuum at 3 × 10-3 Pa, the Ta-Ru coatings showed grain size,
hardness, surface roughness and phase stability comparable to those of as-deposited coatings.
While annealing in vacuum at 3 Pa, preferential oxidation of Ta in the Ta-Ru coatings was
verified and the internal oxidation zone consisting of a laminated structure was observed.
To explore the internal oxidation phenomena, Ta47Ru53 and Mo46Ru54 coatings were
prepared and annealed in oxygen containing atmospheres. Internal oxidation phenomena
appeared in Ta47Ru53 coatings annealed in both 50 and 10000 ppm O2 containing atmospheres.
The Mo46Ru54 coatings exhibit external oxidation at 50 ppm O2 containing atmosphere, and
internal oxidation at 10000 ppm O2 containing atmosphere. Finally, this study proposes an
internal oxidation mechanism for alloy coatings with an orientated structure.
The intermetallic compound phases Cr2Ru and Cr0.398Ru0.602 were identified for the
4usage in ultra-high density magnetic recording [15-17]. The Ta-Ru and Cr–Ru phase diagrams
reveal various intermetallic compounds [13,18,19], offering the potential for a hardness increase
in Ta-Ru and Cr–Ru coatings. Ta and Cr are oxidized easily and the oxide Ta2O5 and Cr2O3 are
recognized to be stable up to 1360 [20] and 1200 [13] oC, respectively, thus Ta-Ru and Cr-Ru
coatings are possibly suitable candidates as protective materials for glass molding dies.
In the present study, Ta-Ru and Cr-Ru coatings were fabricated by direct current magnetron
co-sputtering. Heat-treatment up to 600C in controlled atmosphere was carried out on the alloy
coatings. The corresponding nanohardness, roughness, structural evolution and internal oxidation
phenomenon of the coatings in the as-deposited and heat-treated states were investigated and
intensively discussed.
2. Experimental details
The alloy coatings, Ta-Ru, Mo-Ru, and Cr-Ru layers, were fabricated onto 6 wt.% cobalt
cemented carbide substrates and/or silicon wafers with an interlayer, Cr or Ti, by direct current
magnetron co-sputtering. The sputter guns were inclined in the sputtering chamber to exhibit
plasma focused on the circular track of substrate holder. The substrate holder was rotated with a
speed of 5.0 rpm and heated to 400 °C during sputtering. The alloys coatings were further
annealed at 600C in various atmospheres to investigate the coating characteristics.
A conventional X-ray difractometer (XRD, X’Pert PRO MPD, PANalytical, Netherlands)
with Cu Kαradiation was adopted to identify the phases. The surface hardness of coatings was
measured with a nanoindentation tester (Nano Hardness Tester, CSM, Switzerland) using a
Berkovich diamond probe tip. The nano-hardness and elastic modulus of each indent was
calculated based on the Oliver and Pharr method [21]. The surface roughness values, Ra [22], of
the coatings were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension 3100 SPM,
NanoScope IIIa, Veeco, USA). The surface morphologies of the coatings were evaluated by field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S4800, Hitachi, Japan). The chemical
composition of the coatings was evaluated by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS, Horiba,
Japan) equipped with the FE-SEM or by a field emission electron probe microanalyzer
(FE-EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL, Japan) on the surfaces. The microstructure was examined by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010F, JEOL, Japan). The chemical states of the
constitute elements were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 1600, PHI,
Japan). The chemical composition depth profiles were evaluated by Auger electron spectroscopy
(AES, PHI700, ULVAC-PHI, Japan).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Ta-Ru coatings
3.1.1 As-deposited Ta-Ru coatings
The Ta–Ru coatings with a wide composition range, from 35 to 64 at.%, revealed a
columnar structure with strong crystalline orientation. Figure 1a shows the XRD patterns of
as-deposited Ta-Ru coatings, revealing reflections of tetragonal RuTa [ICDD 08-0343],
hexagonal Ru [ICDD 06-0663] and tetragonal β-Ta phases [ICDD 25-1280]. Corresponding to

oxidized Ta64Ru36 coating.
Fig. 3. Cross-sectional TEM image of a Ta64Ru36
coating annealed for 4 h in vacuum at 3 Pa at
600 °C.
The XPS spectra of the annealed Ta64Ru36 coating were shown in Fig. 4. A binding energy of
531.01 ± 0.02 eV was identified for the spectra of O2- ions in the interior portion. Though oxygen
was incorporated in the Ta-Ru coating, Ru sustained its metallic state. The Ru 3d doublet
revealed binding energies of 279.69 ± 0.10 eV and 283.85 ± 0.13 eV. Ta changed its valence from
Ta5+ dominated on the surface to Ta0 enriched in the interior portion. The 4f doublet was 26.03
and 27.86 eV for Ta5+ on the free surface. The position of Ta5+ 4f7/2 was well consistent with
previous reports in a range of 26.2–26.5 eV for Ta5+ in Ta2O5 [24,25]. Beneath the free surface,
the 4f doublet of Ta5+ were determined to be 26.72 ± 0.09 eV and 28.73 ± 0.07 eV, which were
consistent with a previous report, indicating 26.74 eV for the Ta5+ 4f7/2 transition [9].

h in vacuum at 3 Pa at 600 °C.
Internal oxidation, also called sub scale formation, is the formation of oxide precipitates
within an alloy [26]. The classic internal oxidation phenomenon requires the following conditions
[26,27]: (1) more negative free energy of formation in the internal oxide than the base metal
oxide, (2) negative value of free energy of formation for the reaction B(diss.) + νO(diss.) = BOν,
and (3) a lower concentration of the solute elements than that required for the transition from
internal to external oxidation.
Since the formation Gibbs energies of RuO2, Ta2O5 and MoO2 at 600 oC are -157534,
-663572 and -428554 J/(mole O2) [28], respectively, Ta2O5 and MoO2 forms more often than
RuO2 does. To explore the internal oxidation phenomena, Ta47Ru53 and Mo46Ru54 coatings were
prepared and annealed in 50 ppm and 10000 ppm oxygen containing atmospheres. In the sample
preparation, the substrate was alternately exposed to two sources in the co-sputtering process; the
as-deposited Ta47Ru53 coating revealed a metallic laminated structure in the columnar structure.
The substrate holder was rotated at 5.0 rpm and the sputtering time was 21.5 min. As the coating
thickness was 678 nm, the period of the as-deposited metal film should be 6.3 nm. Observation of
cross-sectional TEM images shows that the period of laminated metal/metal structure in the
8Young’s modulus revealed decreasing tendency as increasing Cr content in the Cr-Ru coatings.
The surface roughness values of Cr47Ru53, Cr56Ru44, Cr65Ru35 and Cr83Ru17 coatings were 3.4, 3.3,
1.9 and 4.5 nm, respectively.

coatings.

Reflections of Cr2O3 [ICDD 38-1479] and Cr0.398Ru0.602 phases revealed in the XRD spectra
of the annealed Cr47Ru53, Cr56Ru44 and Cr65Ru35 coatings as shown in Fig. 8.
Figure 9 shows the top view and cross-sectional SEM images of the annealed Cr47Ru53 and
Cr65Ru35 coatings. The cross-sectional SEM images show that a dense oxide scale presents in
both coatings. The annealed Cr47Ru53 coating reveals some whisker-like oxides outside the free
surface as seen in the top view SEM image. The whisker-like oxides cover all the surface of the
annealed Cr65Ru35 coating. The columnar structure in the as-deposited state transformed to the
granular structure.

sectional images (c) & (d) of Cr47Ru53and
Cr65Ru35 coatings annealed at 600oC in 50 ppm
O2-N2 atmosphere for 2 h, respectively.
Fig.10. AES depth profiles of the annealed
Cr65Ru35 coatings.
Figure 10 shows the AES depth profiles of the annealed Cr65Ru35 coating, revealing a Cr2O3
scale formed on the surface, a Cr depleted zone present beneath the oxide layer and the part with
original concentration in the interior. The Cr concentration in the Cr depleted zone reveal a
gradient from high Cr content in the Cr-Ru coating to low Cr content in the Cr2O3 oxide scale.
The hardness and Young’s modulus values of Cr-Ru coatings decreased after annealing.
Since the thickness of Cr2O3 layers is around 150 nm and the indentation depth of the Berkovich
tip is within the range of 68 to 81 nm, the hardness analysis combines the effects from the surface
oxide layer, the Ru enrich region and the granular Cr0.398Ru0.602 grains.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 As-deposited Ta-Ru and Mo-Ru coatings
The Ta:Ru and Mo:Ru ratios of as-deposited coatings were
47.1:52.9 and 46.4:53.6, respectively, as determined by FE-EPMA.
The oxygen contents in the as-deposited Ta47Ru53 and Mo46Ru54
coatings were 1.5 and 3.7 at.%, respectively, indicating that the weak
oxidation due to residual oxygen in the vacuum chamber could be
ignored. These coatings were denoted as Ta47Ru53 and Mo46Ru54
coatings. A columnar structure appeared on the silicon wafer, with
cross-sectional SEM observations confirming the presence of a Cr
interlayer for both as-deposited coatings. The as-deposited Ta47Ru53
and Mo46Ru54 coatings were 678 and 751 nm thick, respectively. The
surface roughness values of the as-deposited Ta47Ru53 and Mo46Ru54
coatings were 1.4±0.1 and 1.0±0.1 nm, respectively. Figures 1 and 2
show that the XRD pattern of the as-deposited Ta47Ru53 coatings
revealed reflections of β-Ta, Ru and RuTa phases, while the XRD
pattern of the as-deposited Mo46Ru54 coatings revealed Ru and
Mo5Ru3 phases [19], respectively.
3.2 Annealed Ta47Ru53 coatings
Table I lists the chemical compositions of Ta47Ru53 coatings
annealed at 600 oC in a 50 ppm O2–N2 atmosphere. The oxygen
content of the annealed Ta47Ru53 coatings increased from 38.0, to
Fig. 1. XRD spectra of Ta47Ru53 coatings annealed in a 50 ppm O2-N2
atmosphere for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min.
40.3, to 47.4, to 50.0, to 50.5 at.% as the annealing time increased
from 10, to 20, to 30, to 60, to 90 min, respectively. The atomic ratios
of Ta/(Ta+Ru) sustained a fixed level of 0.45-0.47. The annealed
Ta-Ru coating included an oxidized zone and a columnar grain zone,
as figure 3 shows. Table I lists the thicknesses of these zones. The
interface between the oxidized zone and the columnar grain zone
moved toward the Cr interlayer as the annealing time increased. After
60 min of annealing, the whole coating evolved to an internal
oxidation zone consisting of a laminated structure. Figures 3d and 4
show cross-sectional images of the 90 min annealed Ta47Ru53 coating
from SEM and TEM observations, respectively. In the TEM image,
the original columnar feature is still clear. The oxygen content
reached a saturated value of 50 at.% after 60 min of annealing. The
atomic ratio of O/Ta was 2.2, which is close to the theoretical value
of Ta2O5. Figure 1 shows the XRD spectra of the annealed Ta47Ru53
coatings. Reflections of the orthorhombic Ta2O5 phase [19] appeared
after 10 min of annealing, accompanied by reflections of theβ-Ta, Ru
and RuTa phases. When the Ta47Ru53 coatings were annealed for
more than 60 min, the reflections of β-Ta and RuTa phases
disappeared and only reflections of Ru and Ta2O5 phases existed.
Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional TEM image of the laminated
structure consistimg of crystallite layers after 10 min of annealing.
The bright and dark layers in this image correspond to the
orthorhombic Ta2O5 and hexagonal Ru phases, respectively.

exceeded 30 min. Figure 8 shows that the surface morphology of the
Mo46Ru54 coating annealed for 90 min is covered with randomly
distributed needle-like oxides. The coating thickness remained at the
original level and the columnar structure sustained in the
cross-sectional feature. Table II shows that the surface roughness
values of annealed Mo46Ru54 coatings evaluated by AFM remained at
1-2 nm, except for the 90 min annealed Mo46Ru54 coating, which

could not be detected.
After annealing at 600 oC in a 10000 ppm O2–Ar atmosphere, the
Mo/(Mo+Ru) ratios decreased to 0.35 and 0.32 after 60 and 90 min of
annealing, respectively, due to the formation and volatility of MoO3.
Note that MoO3 becomes volatile above 550
oC [20,21]. The
reflection intensities of the Mo5Ru3 phase in the XRD spectra
diminished as the annealing time increased, while those of the MoO2
and Ru phases increased (Fig. 9). Figure 10 shows cross-sectional
SEM images of Mo46Ru54 coatings annealed in a 10000 ppm O2-Ar
atmosphere. Similar to the annealed Ta-Ru coatings, the outer parts of
the coatings transformed to the oxidized zone, whose thicknesses
appear in Table II. Figure 11a shows a cross-sectional bright field
TEM image of the 90 min annealed sample. The outer part of the
internal oxidation region, region A in Fig. 11a, exhibited
recrystallized grains. The selected area diffraction patterns of region
A and B in Fig. 11a reveal similar spots, from Ru and MoO2 phases,
as shown in Figs. 11b&c, respectively. The atomic ratios of O/Mo
were 2.3 and 2.6 for the 60 and 90 min annealed samples, implying
the formation of high valence molybdenum oxides such as MoO3 in
the coatings. The width enlargement of oxidized coating was limited
by the volatility of MoO3. The formation of MoO3 roughened the free
surface of Mo-Ru coatings, as indicated by the surface roughness
values in Table II.
3.4 Internal oxidation mechanism
Internal oxidation, which is also called sub scale formation, is
the formation of oxide precipitates within an alloy [9]. The classic
internal oxidation phenomenon requires the following conditions
[7,9]: (1) more negative free energy of formation in the internal oxide
than the base metal oxide, (2) negative value of free energy of
formation for the reaction B(diss.) +νO(diss.) = BOν, and (3) a lower
concentration of the solute elements than that required for the
transition from internal to external oxidation.
Since the formation Gibbs energies of RuO2, Ta2O5 and MoO2 at
600 oC are -157534, -663572 and -428554 J/(mole O2) [22],
respectively, Ta2O5 and MoO2 forms more often than RuO2 does. The
internal oxidation phenomenon occurs as oxygen diffuses into the

10000 ppm O2-Ar atmosphere for (a) 10, (b) 30, (c) 60 and (d) 90 min,
respectively.
