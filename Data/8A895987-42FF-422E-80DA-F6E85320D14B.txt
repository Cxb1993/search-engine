1. Introduction 
Time series model is a popular method and is successfully used in forecasting economic, 
marketing, social problems, etc. While this model has the advantage of accurate forecasting 
over short periods, it also has the limitation that at least 50 and preferably 100 observations or 
more should be used. However, when we look around the rapid change of current 
socio-economic situations, it is sometimes impossible to collect 50 data or above for forecasting 
a new product demand or a new system developing. For solving limited time series data, the 
grey model GM(1,1) (Deng 1986) (Deng 1989) was defined and introduced in management and 
engineering applications, whereas it uses limited data to obtain point estimation which supplies 
too little information for the decision maker, and it still cannot be applied with fuzzy-input val-
ues. For solving fuzzy relation between independent variables and dependent variable or lim-
ited datum, fuzzy regression was first introduced by Tanaka et al in 1982 but seldom applied 
for time series data. An application that uses fuzzy regression to time series analysis was pre-
sented by Watada, and Tseng et al. proposed the fuzzy ARIMA method which uses the fuzzy 
regression method to fuzzify the parameters of the ARIMA model. However, FARIMA method 
has been criticized that that they could use the obtained ARIMA (2,0,0) to forecast directly, and 
rather than contradict to operate fuzzy ARIMA (2,0,0). Kim et al have shown that the forecast-
ing error in fuzzy regression model is better than statistical regression if the collected data is 
smaller by simulation and comparison those two models.  
Therefore, we have developed a fuzzy grey regression model for analyzing limited time 
series data by hybridizing fuzzy set theory into the grey model GM(1,1), and solving it by a 
linear programming model with as little as four data. However, fuzzy grey regression model 
cannot fit all types of data that collected over time tend to exhibit trends observations in differ-
ent time period are autocorrelated. That is, the effect of the independent variable on the de-
pendent variable is distributed over time. Then, a change in the current value of independent

to formulate fuzzy grey regression model, and in Figure 4 we find that its linear trend derives to 
wide forecasting interval which contributes too little information for the decision maker. Then 
the fuzzy grey autoregressive model is proceeded with the following steps.

Step 1. Find the rough autoregressive model  
In time series model, the maximum number of lags (as suggested by Box and Jenkins) is 
roughly n/4 for a series where n is the number of observations. In Table 2 and Figure 5, the 
autocorrelation coefficients are obtained and shown where there are two significant autocorre-
lation at lag 1 and lag two, and the autocorrelations appear to cut off after lag 2. Besides, in Fig-
