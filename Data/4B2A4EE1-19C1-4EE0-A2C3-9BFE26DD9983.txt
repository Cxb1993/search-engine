LDPC(Low-Density Parity-Check)碼為下個世代的先進通訊標準所採用的錯誤更正
碼，其優異的錯誤更正能力可以逼近 Shannon 的理論值，配合訊息傳遞(message passing, MP)
演算法，可以快速得到傳送端所發出之訊息。但是 MP 法不保證得到為最佳的解碼結果，故
在本論文裡，將把它和 A*法結合作混和解碼，但同時也把它們的優缺點作比較，由結果發現，
A*法的編碼增益較 MP 法高，但是解碼的複雜度隨碼長度呈指數性增加，而非如 MP 法的線
性增加。 
若採用混和式架構，則可以得到與 A*相同的編碼增益，同時解碼複雜度只略大於
MP 法。當使用碼長 96 bits、碼率為 1/2 的 LDPC 碼，並在 BER = 510− 時，本論文所提出之
混和式架構比 MP 法提高 1.4 dB 的編碼增益，經實驗統計結果得知約只有 1%的接收序列在
第一階段 MP 法不成功時，要轉入第二階段的 A*法，因為 A*法保證得到最佳解。故混和式
架構的解碼方式，可以在編碼增益(由 A*法所提供)與解碼複雜度(只有約 1%的序列要作 A*
法，剩餘的約 99%序列由快速的 MP 法解出)之間取得一個平衡。

For block codes there is an optimum decoding 
algorithm named A*, which is presented by [8]. 
Instead of parallel iteration decoding, A* is a 
sequential tree search method, which guarantees to 
find the optimum solution efficiently. The A* method 
tries to find the shortest path for the metric derived 
from the maximum likelihood principle. Because of 
the optimality, the A* method can be applied when 
the suboptimum MP method fails. 
This paper will propose a mixed decoding 
method to balance the decoding gain and decoding 
complexity. It improves the decoding performance 
for MP method once it fails. It is found that only 
about 1% received sequences need to be 
transferred to A* decoding stage. 
2. System model and simulation 
To simulate LDPC code for various decoding 
algorithms, we need first to construct the code with 
certain desired constraints. We adopted the Rule 1B 
of MacKay’s rule [5]. Let 3=J , overlap=1, 
girth=6. We have constructed 5 kinds of ),( KN  
LDPC codes )16,32(1 =C , )32,64(2 =C , 
)84,96(3 =C , )72,96(4 =C  and )48,96(5 =C . 
Among them 1C , 2C  and 5C  have the different 
code lengths but with the same code rate 1/2. On the 
contrary, 3C , 4C , and 5C  have the same code 
length but different code rate. 
In Figure 1, at the transmitter end the 
information sequence }1,0{∈im  of block length 
K is encoded by the generator matrix G to yield a 
codeword }{ ic  with }1,0{∈ic . After the BPSK 
modulation, it is mapped to }{ ix , with 
}1,1{−∈ix where 12 −= icix . It is then transmitted 
through an discrete time AWGN channel and a 
received sample is denoted by inixiy += , where 
in  is the white Gaussian noise with signal-to-noise 
ratio SNR defined by 
)22/(0/SNR σRPNbE == , where P  is the 
signal power, R  is the code rate, 2σ  is the noise 
variance. We will assume 1=P  so that the SNR is 
expressed in terms of 2σ . The code rate appearing 
in the SNR is to keep the comparison for different 
code rates at the same SNR level. When expressed in 
dB we have SNR= )0/(10log10 NbE . 
The simulation results will demonstrate the 
performances for various decoding algorithms. The 
MP algorithm adopts LLR as the messages for the bit 
and check nodes. While running the A* algorithm, 
we preset the largest stack size as 1000. When stack 
overflow occurs, the stack will remove those nodes 
with larger metrics. In this paper we compare both 
the MP and A* algorithms and the design for 
combining these two methods as shown in the block 
diagram of Figure 2. Once the resulting sequence 
of MP method fails the syndrome test, we will 
transfer it to the A* decoding stage. The parameters 
for LDPC code are: code rate 8/7~2/1=R ，block 
length =N 32~96 bits, and the maximum iteration 
number =maxL 5~1000. 
3. Simulation Results and Analysis 
Figures 6-7 show the BER versus SNR 
performance for the comparison of the methods. The 
notation MP5 denotes the MP algorithm with 
maximum iteration number 5max =L . The 
notation Mix5 is for the mixed algorithm of MP and 
A* and with the first MP stage using 5max =L . 
The notations MP5(I) and MP5(II) are explained as

that the receiver needs to wait for a long time to get 
the result. 
6. Efficiency comparison 
As show in Table 1, the advantage of the Mix 
scheme is that we can get the similar decoding gain 
as the A* method and its decoding complexity is not 
much increased with respect to MP method. When 
we consider the hardware complexity, because the 
Mix method is composed of two algorithms, it has 
higher hardware complexity. To reduce the waste for 
just an algorithm is running and the other one is 
waiting, we can run both algorithms at the same time.

7. Conclusions 
Because the next generation stander will adopt 
LDPC codes of length larger than 5000 bits, it is 
better to use the MP method only. But because it is 
just an suboptimum algorithm, its performance is not 
guaranteed. 
The proposed Mix scheme tr ies  to take 
advantage of both the MP and the A* algor i thms,  
so that  the solut ion is  near ly  opt imum. Thus i t  
improves  the  suboptimum proper ty  of the  MP 
method.  For  the case tha t  MP method fa i ls ,  the 
decoder  has another  opt imum method to 
implement .  Because A* may use a  pr ior i ty  s tack 
with dynamic s ize,  which may grow 
exponentia l ly ,  the  complexi ty of decoding is  a  
major  problem.  For tunately,  about  1% received 
sequences could  not  pass  the f i rs t  s tage and need 
to be processed by the  A* s tage for  the  opt imum 
solut ion.  
Our  proposed Mix algor i thm can solve the 
problem of decoding performance and decoding 
complexi ty .  I ts  performance is  the same as  A*, 
but  i t  needs  to  combine  two stages  of MP and A*.  
So the hardware complexi ty is  h igher  than MP 
only.  As for  i ts  decoding complexi ty ,  i t  depends  
on the fa i lure rate of the f i rs t  MP s tage.  So i t  
var ies  between l inear  and exponentia l  ones .  The 
advantage is  tha t  i t  solves the  problem of the 
fa i lure  of  the  MP method and can get  an 
opt imum solut ion.  For tunate ly ,  one  may not  
need to go to the second s tage.  For  example ,  
when a  LDPC code of rate 1 /2 a t  BER = 510− ,  
there  are  about  1% received samples  need the A* 
s tage.  The res t  99% received samples  can be 
solved by the f i rs t  s tage .  Our proposed method 
improves  about  1 .4 dB of SNR. So we proposed 
an compromised method to take care  of both 
decoding gain and decoding complexi ty .  In [11]  
a  method named augmented bel ief-propagat ion 
decoding is  presented to  reuse the resul t  of  MP 
method when i t  fa i ls .  We found that  we can 
apply the idea of A* method to reuse the MP 
resul t ,  and this  wil l  be  shown in  our  future  
work.
