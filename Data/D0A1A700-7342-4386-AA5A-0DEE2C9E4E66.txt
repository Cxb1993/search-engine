at the antenna. It is soon apparent that the ADC 
in the SDR receiver (SDR RX) must fulfill 
extraordinary specifications. For example, to 
digitize the frequency band from 800 MHz to 
5.5 GHz, where all of today’s cellular and 
WLAN channels lie, will require a 12 bit, 11 
GS/s ADC. Not only is this ADC impossible 
today, it will remain so in the foreseeable future 
because ADC dynamic range and conversion 
are known to progress at a rate much slower 
than Moore’s law. Even if we knew how to 
build an ADC with these specifications, its 
power dissipation might be hundreds of watts. 
To find a way out of this impasse, we must 
question Mitola’s paradigm. To break the link 
between carrier frequency and ADC sample rate, 
the band of interest can be first downconverted 
to within the ADC’s Nyquist band. Toshiba uses 
RF prefilters for antialiasing to realize a mainly 
digital, flexible receiver for PDC and DCS. 
Switch selectable RF filters at 1.5 and 1.9 GHz 
pass 27-MHz-wide bands which are digitized. 
The 27-MHz-wide band is translated to one 
side of DC so that the stopband of the RF filter 
attenuates images that will now lie on the other 
side of DC. With these measures, the image is 
actually suppressed by 70 dB. This receiver is 
one step in the right direction even though the 
covered bandwidth was still limited. Recently, 
Professor Abidi from UCLA has proved the 
practicability of SDR by utilizing a wideband 
receiver architecture, which again validates the 
importance of frequency conversion. To realize 
of the front-end circuits required in this 
application, we have developed a series of 
design equations for wideband LNA, mixer, 
and bandwidth-tunable low pass filter. 
Hopefully by this proposal, we can fulfill the 
prospect of the SDR [1]. 
 
三、文獻探討 
目前關於軟體定義無線電的研究在國內
電子學門尚未受到重視，然而在國外實際上
卻已經有許多研究團隊在關心這個議題。以
比利時Leuven大學的Dr. Craninckx為主的研
究團隊，在今年 ISSCC 會議上發表了一個在
130nm CMOS 製程下實現的軟體定義無線電
收發機[2]。Dr. Craninckx 的架構是以可調整
式射頻電路搭配可調整式基頻電路所達成的
軟體定義無線電收發機。然而在這篇論文
中，確有一些實際上的問題。首先是在射頻
前端電路之前所置放的一個微機電式開關，

四、研究方法 
The whole picture of the proposed 
wideband SDR transceiver is depicted in Fig. 1. 
The research of this sub-project is mainly 
focused on the RF functional blocks including 
low noise amplifier, mixer, driver and low pass 
filter for transmitter. The other three 
sub-projects will be interested in the frequency 
synthesizer, baseband circuits, and analog to 
digital converter.

in Fig. 3 (b). The input impedance Zin is 
dominated by Rf since the impedance looking 
into the gate of M1 is relatively high. Therefore, 
the feedback resistor RFB can be adjusted to 
obtain good input return loss. According 
equation (1), the input return loss S11 can be 
expressed as

In general, S11 should be smaller than -10 dB

From equation (6), the matching bandwidth can

The solutions of r  that satisfy the equation (7) 
can be obtained as follows: 
92.152.0 ≤≤ r       (8) 
Therefore, the correspondent range for Rf is 
equal to 
               96≤≤26 fR .        (9) 
Here the example for real case design is 
given, the power gain of 12 dB (ignored the 
effect of RFB at the start of estimation) is chosen 
to meet the cases of conventional wideband 
application while considering the parasitic loss 
of 2 dB [5]-[12]. The correspondent voltage 
gain from gate of M1 to RL is 41 =Lm Rg . Thus 
the transconductance of 80 mS is obtained. 
The resistant in the shunt feedback path 
directly adds noise current to the input leading 
to increase the overall NF of the amplifier. 
Proper selection of a shunt feedback resistor, 
however, can minimize the noise contribution 
from the feedback resistor. The higher Rf of 
70Ω  (> 50Ω ) is chosen for obtaining the lower 
NF. By equation (2), the RFB of 300 Ω  is 
obtained. Furthermore, the reasonable power 
consumption for wideband LNA designs 
[5]-[12] are 9~33.2 mW. The lower power 
consumption of 12 mW is chosen, thus the bias 
current of this amplifier is 10 mA while 
operating with the voltage of 1.2 V. The respect 
size ratio of the M1 can be decided that the 
correspondent intrinsic capacitor Cgs1 is 200 fF. 
Now, the Rf and Cgs1 are given, from 
equation (7) the matching bandwidth can be 
swept to the reasonable Rf corresponded to the 
equation (9) as shown in Fig. 4. It can be 
observed that the about 40Ω  of Rf will achieve 
the maximum matching bandwidth. It indicates 
that the tradeoff between matching bandwidth 
and NF are raised from the conventional 
resistive feedback topology for LNA design.

By equation (11), the Rf of 70Ω and Cgs1 of 
200 fF are chosen as mentioned previously, the 
Lg of 0.7 nH is obtained, thus the frequency at 
the matching boundary can be obtained by 
equation (15), is equal to 12.4 GHz and also 
can be seen in Fig. 5 and Fig. 7.

C. Analysis for the Flatness of Noise Figure 
In wideband applications, it is important for a 
wideband amplifier with the flat gain response 
and the wideband input impedance matching, 
the flatness of the NF is also required. In this 
Section, the flatness of NF is analyzed to gain 
more insight for wideband LNA design. 
Fig. 12 shows the equivalent of Fig. 10 (a) 
for its NF calculation. The source resistor Rs

current gni and channel resistor thermal noise 
current ndi  are given. Their mean square 
values are listed in equations (21)-(24), 
respectively.

the inductor Lg is not only used for extending 
the matching bandwidth, but also flattening the 
NF of conventional resistive feedback LNA. 
Fig. 16 shows the analytic NF results for a 
critical-damped (Qin=0.707) input network of 
the wideband LNA with varies inductor LP. The 
use of inductor LP is also helpful for improving 
NF in higher frequency while in gain 
enhancement.

D. Receiver Design 
Fig. 17 shows the proposed front-end 
integrated receiver circuit. The proposed SDR 
receiver is planned for the applications around 
the frequency of 800 MHz ~ 6 GHz. The gain 
in higher frequencies is prevented from rolling 
off by the series inductors LP. To complete the 
single to differential transition, the wideband 
micro-mixer is used for designing a wideband 
down-converter. This topology is with the 
function of single-differential transition. 
Fig. 18 shows the simulated results for 
wideband LNA. The gain of >13 dB and 
return-loss of <-10 dB are obtained in the 
frequency band of 800 MHz ~ 6 GHz as shown 
in Fig. 18(a). The NF is < 2.8 dB in the 
frequency band of 800 MHz ~ 6 GHz as shown 
in Fig. 18(b). 
Fig. 19 shows the simulated results for 
SDR wideband receiver. The return- loss of 
<-10 dB is obtained in the frequency band of 
800 MHz ~ 6 GHz as shown in Fig. 19(a). The 
RF frequency, 800 MHz (lower boundary) and 
6 GHz (higher boundary) are down-converted 
respectively with LO to the IF frequencies of 
0.1~528MHz as shown in Fig. 19 (b). It can be 
seen that the error of the conversion gain is < 2 
dB over the frequency band of 800 MHz ~ 6 
GHz. The NF of SDR wideband receiver is 
shown in Fig. 19(c). Fig. 19 (d) shows the 
down-converted IF differential signal. The 
proposed SDR wideband receiver draws 11.5 
mA from VDD of 1.5 V.

E. Transmitter Design 
   Fig. 20 shows the proposed front-end 
integrated transmitter circuit. The conventional 
cascode topology in Fig. 21 is not suitable to 
design a high linearity transmitter because of its 
poor linearity. The strategy is to design a driver 
amplifier with the topology of two-stage. To 
prevent the gain at high frequency from rolling 
off, the gain in higher frequencies is 
compensated by the series inductors, Lg, Lg1, 
L1, Lp.

transmitter for SDR

Fig. 22 shows simulated S-parameter for the 
driver amplifier. Fig. 22 (a) shows that the 
proposed driver amplifier has the variable gain 
range of >20 dB and the output return-loss of 
<-10 dB while varying the power gain as shown 
in Fig. 22(b). Fig. 23 (a) shows the output 
return loss of whole SDR transmitter. The 
return- loss of <-10 dB are revealed in the 
frequency band of 800 MHz ~ 6 GHz. Fig. 23 
(b) shows the output spectrum under the 
condition of  input power of -20 dBm (at 
500MHz). It also reveals that the output power 
of the transmitter is above -10 dBm over the 
frequency range of 800 MHz ~ 6 GHz. Besides, 
the down-converted signal also appears in the 
output spectrum. It can be further omitted by 
the topology of single-sideband mixer. Fig. 23 
(c) shows the linearity of the SDR transmitter. 
This transmitter shows the output 1-dB 
compression point at -5.1 dBm. The proposed 
SDR wideband transmitter draws 12 mA from 
VDD of 1.5 V.

The current feedback signals are converted 
back to those in voltage domain by series 
resistors in the paths The simulated AC

is run to check the time-domain performance,
