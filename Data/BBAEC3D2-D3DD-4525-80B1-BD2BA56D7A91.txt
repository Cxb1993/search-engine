二、緣由與目的 
高科技製造產業鏈在產品需求、製程、零組件
與原材料供應 各方面通常有極高的不確定性，這
些不確定性所引發的動態事件對供應鏈的工作負
載(workload)和產能需求(capacity requirements)往
往造成嚴重影響。例如，2005 年春季日月光公司
的中壢工廠發生工業火災，燒毀多樓層的廠房，
封裝基板產能完全喪失，不 僅衝擊該公司的營運，
對整個半導體產業也造成影響。半導體產業也經
常發生產品進程不順 (如 CPU、晶片組)、產品需
求的突發性熱烈、製程研發延誤等事件。不確定
與動態事件的影響不僅限於個別企業之內，也會
隨者產業鏈擴散，因此是供應鏈研究與企業所關
切的問題，本計畫的具體研究目標就是針對不確
定與動態事件發展協同控制的機制與方法。 
高科技產業鏈的基本結構如圖（一）所示，
由於存在不確定因素，協調控制機制的功能是要
能運用備用資源、維持優良的整體績效。以產能
與生產為決策（decision variables），本計畫有三
項研究主題：動態事件的最佳前攝控制、多方委
外製造的產能競爭、以及面對不確定產品需求的

3.3  不確定需求的產能規劃 
 
許多高科技製造產業具有產品需求易變、產
能投資成本高且不可逆、技術更迭快速等特性，
又由於景氣循環現象顯著，產能供給與需求經常
發生失衡。產能投資的抉擇不僅決定經營獲利，
也會影響廠商的長期競爭力，因此產能投資是廠
商的重要決策。產能投資決策可分為產能規模
(sizing)與就緒時點(timing)兩大類的方法。 前者是
要決定該建置多少產能，其決策變數為產能增量，
後者則是要決定在什麼時間點建置產能，決策變

Abstract 
In industries that manufacture highly-engineered products, manufacturing firms usually engage in multiple project 
products in various phases of life cycle. This paper is based on a case study of a manufacturer in the defense 
industry that is engaged in multiple project products in various phases of life cycle. Projects are classified as R&D 
projects, production projects, and maintenance and logistic service projects. Successful R&D projects will lead to 
production projects and subsequent service projects. This paper addresses a business strategy decision issue of 
whether to be aggressive or conservative by allocating more resources to R&D or not. Since resources are 
constrained, outsourcing is utilized in production and service projects. A methodology is presented for finding an 
efficient allocation of resources among projects and outsourcing to optimize the organization’s long-term prospect 
while satisfying short-term mission. Its application is demonstrated with three strategies of organization development: 
conservative, ordinary, and aggressive.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Most production organizations have both short-term 
mission to deliver current work orders and long-term 
mission to continue developing new capabilities that 
are necessary for acquiring new orders in the future. A 
semiconductor fabrication factory that must process 
mass production lots and engineering pilot lots by using 
the same set of machines is an example of such 
production organizations. Because of high investment 
cost of wafer fabrication plants, process/product R&D 
does not have dedicated equipment and both 
engineering lots and mass production lots are usually 
run in the same facility. Since engineering lots are used 
to work out yield problems, it is important that they are 
given top priority in factory scheduling so as to shorten 
product development time. A shorter time-to-market 
then has a higher probability of generating a larger 
demand in the future. However, by giving pilot lots a 
higher priority, the efficiency of regular production for 
customer orders will be adversely affected. Trade-offs 
between the two types of production is an important 
operation management issue [1]. 
The manufacturing of highly engineered products, such 
as aero-space systems and defense systems, typically 
involves development, fabrication, testing, deployment 
and in-use support and maintenance. The demands for 
those products usually are uncertain in both quantity 
and timing. Furthermore, the total production quantity is 
low and is spread out over a long duration. These 
products are managed as projects over their life time 
and in this paper they are called project products or 
projects for brevity. Managing a portfolio of project 
products in various phases of life cycle and training 
employees for migrating to high value-add portfolios 
are key management functions. 
Projects are often regarded as building blocks for 
executing corporate strategies. In today’s dynamic 
business environment, firms must manage the whole 
collection of projects as one entity and link the set of 
projects with the ultimate business objective [2]. There 
are two categories of multiple project management 
problems: multiple project management and project 
portfolio management. In the multi-project environment, 
projects are loosely related, except for sharing some 
resources. As a result, allocation and scheduling of 
resource use are key issues of concern. In many R&D 
organizations, the matrix structure is commonly used 
and employees of different disciplines or divisions are 
assigned to various projects. Whether one person 
should be assigned to one or multiple projects 
becomes a fundamental factor of productivity. If a 
person’s time is scattered in more projects, the 
individual’s efficiency within each project will in general 
decrease. Hendriks, Boeten and Kroep advocated a 
practice of dividing human resources into all-round 
project members, experts, and service employees in 
order to improve overall efficiency and the practice also 
provides links between long-term, medium-term and 
short-term resource allocations [3].  
In portfolio management, the challenge is to select, 
prioritize and coordinate projects. Dickinson, Thornton, 
and Graves described a case of product development 
improvement projects whose missions are to improve 
the capability of product development, as compared to 
product development itself [4]. The improvement 
projects are interdependent and vary in probability of 
success, project cost, and capability impact. By using 
an independency matrix, they constructed a non-linear 
integer program to optimize project selection. Their 
model seeks to strike a balance between risk, overall 
objectives, and the cost and benefit of the entire 
portfolio. In new product development in engineering 
companies, concurrent development of products gives 
rise to critical requirements on project management. 
Due to commonality of parts, system integration, 
technological prerequisites, and market interaction, 
there are not only resource interdependencies but also 
input/output interdependencies between projects [5]. 
De Mario et al. also identified and developed 
prescriptive models for five fundamental steps of the 
multi-project management process: (1) individual 
project evaluation, classification and initial screening, 
(2) Multi-project classification and selection, (3) actions 
for improvement and portfolio reclassification, (4) 
priority assignment, (5) ongoing control of project 
20th International Conference on Production Research 
mature products typically have lower value-add. 
Outsourcing, therefore, also facilitates organization 
learning.

From Tables 1 and 2, the average revenue per R&D 
personnel can be calculated. As shown in the following 
figure, the productivity function is convex. It is thus 
desirable from the firm’s perspective to be aggressive. 
However, the risk in not being able to deliver the 
products and to service the products will also increase, 
since fewer workforces will be left for production and 
service. To find the optimal level of resource allocation 
is the problem that will be addressed in the next 
section.

3. MATHEMATICAL MODELING 
Before suppliers’ resources can be leveraged in 
production and service, training must be provided. 
Training suppliers require human resources to be 
allocated. Thus, the system builder must allocate its 
human resources among four types of projects: R&D 
projects, production projects, service projects and 
training projects (Figure 2). Training will consume 
resources, but they will also enable suppliers’ 
resources to be made available for production and 
service projects through contracts. The gain is positive. 
That is, for each person that is devoted to training, the 
suppliers, once qualified, can deliver more than 
one-person worth of productive capability. This gain is 
represented by parameters α and β in the figure. The 
R&D, production, service and training projects will be 
numerically indexed as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let ri be the 
amount of resources allocated to project i.

The production workloads associated with each project 
by time is represented as wj,t and the service workloads 
are represented as sj,t. Note that there is time lag 
between production and service that is required after 
deployment. The decision variables are x’s for selecting 
one of the three strategies and other resource 
allocation variables. Let yi be the number of trainer 
teams for three levels of project. This decision problem 
can be modeled by a mixed-integer linear program. The 
constraints are:

The three strategies are mutually exclusive. This is 
enforced by equation (1). For any choice of the strategy, 
corresponding production and service workloads are 
instantiated by inequalities (2) and (3). Equality (4) is 
used to constrain the total number of employees. 
Constraint (5) sets the number of people in the R&D 
group based on a chosen strategy. Inequality (6) 
summarizes the total number of trainers. The last two 
inequalities ensure that there are sufficient workforces 
for production and service projects. 
The objective function is to maximize the revenues.
