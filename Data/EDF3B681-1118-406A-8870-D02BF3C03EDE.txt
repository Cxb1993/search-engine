    For the stress analysis of ultra-thin structures, the modeling of conventional domain 
solution techniques will require a tremendous amount of domain elements, whose aspect ratios 
must have orders close to unity.  Due to this reason, past research work by the finite element 
method seldom investigated ultra-thin layers of composites. This report proposes a boundary 
element approach that may yield accurate stress analysis by coarse mesh-modeling for ultra-thin 
layers of multilayered composites subjected to inertial loads. In this report, the nearly singular 
integrals in the boundary integral equations for displacements and strains are analytically 
integrated. The algorithm has been successfully implemented in an existing computer program 
based on quadratic elements.

Introduction 
 Recently, multilayered composites have been extensively applied in engineering applications 
for the multi-benefits that they provide. The composites are often constructed by bonding 
together different layers of materials together, either isotropic or anisotropic. In achieving this 
high performance, however, the integrity of composites is of utmost importance. Due to different 
properties of the adjoin materials, significant stresses shall arise at interfaces of the layered 
composites under operational environments. The present work aims at providing an expedient, 
yet powerful approach to accurately computing strains/stresses in ultra-thin layers of composites 
subjected to inertial loads due to high-speed rotations. This topic is especially of great importance 
for the composites used in aerospace applications.  
 Laminated composites used in common engineering practice are sometimes very thin [1]. 
Over the years, various approaches have been proposed to investigate interlaminar stresses of 
layered composites. Among many numerical works, Lajczok [2] has applied the finite difference 
technique to the strains and curvatures obtained from MSC/NASTRAN to determine their 
derivatives, which are incorporated into the classical thin plate theory for calculation of 
interlaminar shear stresses. Using a 2D finite element scheme, Tolson [3] calculated interlaminar 
proposed approach are demonstrated by a few examples. 
 
Boundary integral equation for anisotropic bodies with inertial loads 
 As is well known for its distinctive feature that only the domain boundary needs to be 
modeled, the boundary element method has been recognized to be an efficient computational tool 
for engineering analysis. However, this advantageous feature holds true only if no inertial effects 
are considered. As described in details by Zhang et al [17], the volume integral arising from the 
inertial effects can be transformed into a series of boundary ones. For computation of boundary 
values, the transformed boundary integral equation (BIE), which relates the nodal displacements 
uj and tractions tj at the boundary S of the homogeneous elastic domain, is written in indicial 
notation as

where ( )J  ξ represents the Jacobian transformation of the original integration path to the local 
coordinate; the superscript a represents the a-th global node of the boundary mesh, b denotes the 
b-th element, and c is the c-th node of the element. Also in Eq. (10), the in  denotes the unit 
outward normal vector on the boundary. The usual boundary collocation process for all nodes will 
therefore yield a system of equations that can be solved for unknown boundary values.   
 Apparently, the problem of nearly singular integrals will arise when the integrand contain 
singularity at 0kz = . Any attempt to numerically integrate these integrals will fail to yield 
accurate integration values. This situation happens when the source point P on the boundary sits 
very close to the element under integration. It can be obviously seen that the integrands 
associated with 
jiU  and ,j iH , given respectively in Eq. (4a) and (4d), are  weakly singular, 
while the one associated with jiT , given in (4b), is strongly singular. Next, treatments of these 
integrals will be elucidated for each class of singularity individually.  
 
Regularized BIE of Anisotropic Bodes Subjected to Body Forces 
 As noted in the previous description for singularity, the regularization process to remove 
singularity needs to be taken for all singular integrals in the BIE. In what follows, treatments of 
these nearly singular integrals will be described only for quadratic elements, which are commonly 
used in the BEM analysis. For elements of higher orders, the same process can also be followed. 
 Using the Lagrange interpolation as given in Eqs.(9), the generalized coordinate ( )kz ξ  and 
the Jacobian ( )J ξ  may be expressed as

The other weakly singular integral needing to be treated is the third integral term in Eq. (10). By 
substituting the shape function and the fundamental solution into the integrand, the integral is 
written as

 To this end, all nearly singular integrals of the BIE for anisotropic thermoelasticity have 
been fully regularized. However, there is one more issue needs to be addressed for the validity of 
the regularized BIE. As described in details by Shiah and Lin [8], the branch cut of the 
multiple-value function log(z) needs be redefined to be oriented outwards at the source point. The 
purpose of such a process is to avoid the intersection of the negative ξ-axis through the domain, 
which will invalidate the volume integral transformation for the integral of the body force. To 
account for such argument redefinition, one needs to rewrite the logarithmic function in the 
integrands to be 
( )21

log ( ) log log ( )b t t lt
l
z B Rξ ξ ξ
=
= + − + Δ∑                          (32) 
where ( )ξΔ  is the phase difference. For each Gauss integration point Gξ , the phase difference is 
given by 
 ( )21

l
z B Rξ ξ ξ
=
⎛ ⎞Δ = − + −⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠∑                     (33) 
In Eq. (33), the branch cut of the first term on the right hand side is defined in the direction of the 
outward normal vector, while the others adopt the default setting in computers, which has the 
branch cut oriented in the negative ξ-axis.  To make compensation of this phase difference, the 
integration of Eq. (24) for ten-point Gauss integration, for example, is thus rewritten as 
rough meshes may yield fairly consistent results compared with FEM data.  
The second example treated here is a lap-joint shown in Fig. 4 with plates of FR4 bonded 
by an epoxy adhesive (Young’s modulus, E=3GPa, and Poisson’s ratio, ν= 0.38). Suppose the 
lap-joint is subjected to rotation about the origin with an angular velocity ω . The dimensions 
considered are as indicated in the figure.  By virtue of symmetry, only one-half of the physical 
domain is modeled, and plane strain conditions are assumed. 
The adhesive layers, treated as quasi-isotropic materials, have the following properties,

 As shown in Fig. 4, the surfaces along the symmetrical planes are constrained from moving in 
the normal direction. Figure 5 shows the BEM mesh with a total of 50 quadratic elements 
employed for the three sub-regions. An FEM analysis using ANSYS is also carried out in which 
33114 PLANE42 elements with the aspect ratio 1:1 are used; the mesh is again not shown here 
because of the high density of the elements used. The distributions of the boundary stresses are 
shown in Fig.6, 7 for the central plate, the adhesive, and the outer plate, respectively. In these 
figures, the density of FR4 ( ρ ) times l2 2ω  is used for normalizing the computed stresses. Since 
the stress component σ22 is negligible in all three layers, they are not shown here.  As can be 
seen from these figures, even with a relatively coarse mesh, the BEM results are still in very 
satisfactory agreement indeed with those obtained from the refined FEM analysis.  It is perhaps 
worth noting that at the corner edges of the adhesive, the stresses are singular; the discrepancies 
between the results from the two numerical methods which are more evident there are thus to be 
expected. 
 
Conclusions 
 This report proposes an efficient BEM algorithm to accurately compute the interlaminar 
stresses of thin layered composites subjected to inertial forces. The conventional BEM approach 
will encounter the numerical difficulty of nearly singular integrals for modeling thin layers. In 
this paper, the nearly singular integrals of the BIE are fully regularized to give accurate 
integration values no matter how close the source point may be to the element under integration. 
Using coarse meshes, the proposed BEM approach can be applied to model ultra-thin layers of 
composites, while a tremendous amount of fine meshes are required for the modeling of the 
conventional finite element analysis.
