ABSTRACT 
Cooperative and Cognitive Radio (CCR) is a radio technology that is able to intelligently 
sense and learn the current opportunity of spectrum in the surrounding environment of 
heterogeneous networks. According to the utilities of spectrum of CCRN (CCR Network), the 
spectrum ultilization of CCR can be cataloged into Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), Dynamic 
Spectrum Sharing (DSS) and Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM). 
In the part of DSA, Subproject 2 intends to deal with this issue from the aspect of link layer. 
They proposed a dynamic sampling rate adjustment for compressive spectrum sensing over 
CCRN, which can not only track the optimal sampling rate but also determine the unoccupied 
channels accurately in a unified method. Moreover, Subproject 5 further enhances the ability of 
spectrum sensing from the aspects of physical layer. They proposed the Bayesian-based spectrum 
sensing scheme effectively reduce the false-alarm probability of spectrum sensing. 
In the part of DSS, Subproject 1 proposed a fuzzy active period adaptation (FAPA) scheme, 
which decides the active period of IEEE 802.16h system to efficiently coexist with a WLAN 
system in unlicensed spectrum. The proposed FAPA scheme effectively improve the overall 
throughput and reduce the idle time of the spectrum. Subproject 3 considered the collision time 
and the interference time to the primary users in the CCRN and then define the optimal sensing 
period for CR users. Subproject 4 proposed an optimal channel-hopping sequence (OCS) for CR 
users, which is designed by exploiting the optimal load balance between both the channel 
availability and channel utilization within the delay constraints of primary users. The proposed 
OCS scheme effectively maximizes the aggregate throughput and as well guarantee the QoS 
requirement of the primary users. 
In the part of DSM, Subproject 1 proposed a utility function and game theory (UGT) based 
network selection scheme to maximize accommodated number of calls, minimize handoff 
occurrence frequency, and fulfill quality of service (QoS) requirements in heterogeneous wireless 
networks. In addition, Subproject 1 also proposed two scheduling schemes to maximize the 
system throughput and fulfill QoS requirements for the CCRN. One is the dynamic priority 
resource allocation (DPRA) scheme, and the other is the GA with SS grouping resource 
allocation (GGRA) scheme. Otherwise, an intelligent hybrid automatic repeat request (iHARQ) 
scheme is also proposed to dynamically make an appropriate selection of the MCS level for the 
initial packet transmission. Subproject 2 proposed several valuable researches on DSM based on 
the applications of MIMO technology. They utilized the network coding scheme and proposed a 
cooperative network protocol with relay nodes. Besides, they consider the weights of 
beamforming to design an iterative algorithm to maximize the capacity of CCRN. Subproject 3 
aims on the QoS management in CCRN and proposed a subchannel splitting algorithm to modify 
the conventional iterative water filling power allocation scheme. The proposed scheme 
effectively reduces the interference among the users in CCRN. Furthermore, Subproject 3 
proposed an energy efficient resource allocation and relay selection scheme for OFDMA-based

I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
Cooperative and Cognitive Radio Network (CCRN) which combines cognitive radio (CR) 
and cooperative wireless network arouse a lot of research interests and discussion in recent years. 
CR is a radio technology that is able to intelligently sense and learn the current opportunity of 
spectrum in the surrounding environment of heterogeneous networks. Cooperative wireless 
network is built based on the cooperation among several wireless radio nodes such as base 
stations, relays, and user equipments. Those wireless radio nodes form a virtual MIMO 
transmission environment thus can be regarded as an intelligent MIMO technology. According to 
the utilities of spectrum of CCRN, the spectrum utilization of CCR can be cataloged into 
Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) and Dynamic Spectrum 
Management (DSM). DSA is to sense the opportunistic spectrum and to access these spectrum 
resources dynamically; DSS can support the QoS guarantee for each user, in which the priority 
between primary users and secondary users also should be taken into account; DSM is involved 
with many aspects, including spectrum hand-over, multiplexing protocol design, channel 
allocation, power saving and control. Also the broadcasting and beamforming of intelligent 
multi-antenna of physical layer are all belong to field of the DSM. 
The research topics of this integrated project are across five protocol layers of the OSI 
model. Some subprojects accommodate the same layer, but they adopt different viewpoints and 
methods to solve the problems. The integrated research project will be carried out through five 
subprojects including Subproject 1: Traffic Scheduling and Control for Cooperative and 
Cognitive Radio Networks, Subproject 2: MIMO Technologies for Cooperative and 
Cognitive Radio Networks, Subproject 3: Protocol Architecture and QoS Management for 
Cooperative and Cognitive Radio Networks, Subproject 4: Power Management and 
Throughput Enhancement for Cooperative and Cognitive Radio Networks, and Subproject 
5: Spectrum Sensing and Receiver Designs for Cooperative and Cognitive Radio Networks. 
The five subprojects of this integrated project focus on the three dynamic spectrum utilization 
aspects (DSA, DSS and DSM) on protocol layers such as physical layer, link layer (MAC and 
LLC), network layer, transport layer and application layer. Key research emphases will be on the 
intelligent opportunistic radio resource management (RRM), multiple-input, multiple-output 
(MIMO)-based CCR access system, power management, and opportunity spectrum sensing and 
receiver design for CCR. 
The hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is adopted to increase transmission rate in the 
modern wireless communication system such as HIGH-SPEED downlink packet access (HSDPA) 
[11] and WiMAX system [2]. HARQ combines the forward error correction mechanism with the 
original automatic repeat request function, where it operates per transport block. When the cyclic 
redundancy check (CRC) for HS-DSCH has an error, a retransmission of the original transport

A more powerful intelligent technique called fuzzy QL (FQL) algorithm [16], [17] has been 
proposed to model the motion and way of thinking of humans in robot design. The FQL 
algorithm is an extension of the QL into fuzzy inference systems, where fuzzy logic [18], [19] is a 
mathematical approach to emulate the way humans think by using if–then rules. Fuzzy logics can 
deal with soft reasoning instead of crisp. However, the performance of fuzzy logics is highly 
related to the design of the fuzzy rule base. The FQL algorithm applies the QL algorithm in fuzzy 
logics to adaptively adjust the fuzzy rule base for the varying environment according to the 
feedback reinforcement signal. Therefore, the FQL algorithm takes advantages from both fuzzy 
logics and QL to adapt the closed-loop system to uncertain environments. Many applications of 
the FQL algorithm can be found in [20]–[22]. For example, call admission control using the FQL 
algorithm for wideband code-division multiple-access/wireless local area network heterogeneous 
networks with multimedia traffic can achieve higher system throughput and lower handoff rate 
than conventional effective schemes under the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements [22]. 
Therefore, we propose an intelligent HARQ (iHARQ) scheme using the FQL algorithm for 
HSDPA systems in this paper with the purpose of maximizing the system throughput and to keep 
the BLER requirement guaranteed. The iHARQ scheme, which is a sort of IR scheme, not only 
determines an appropriate MCS level for initial packet transmission but learns the function 
between the MCS level and the measured BLER with delayed CQI as well. An initial result of 
this paper was given in [23]. In this paper, we further effectively divide the fuzzy rules into three 
parts to accelerate the learning process. Moreover, the reinforcement signal is properly designed 
according to the results of both initial transmission and retransmissions. Simulation results show 
that the iHARQ scheme outperforms the conventional ATS scheme [8] and the QL-based HARQ 
(QL-HARQ) scheme [11]. In particular, when the mobile user is in speed of between 10 and 120 
km/h, the iHARQ scheme can increase the system throughput up to 75.2% compared with the 
ATS scheme and up to 16.4% compared with the QL-HARQ scheme. 
An emerging idea to solve the problem of spectrum drought is relied on cognitive radio (CR) 
networks where the unlicensed users are allowed to cleverly utilize the spectrum holes if the 
induced interference causes harmless effects. To dynamically switch among available spectrum 
holes, each CR user has to sense the wideband spectrum in a fast and efficient manner. To fulfill 
the goal, compressive spectrum sensing has been proposed to enable the sensing of spectrum at a 
sub-Nyquist sampling rate. With the compressive sampling rate, the complexity of the wideband 
RF circuit for spectrum sensing is greatly reduced. Also, the requirement of fewer spectrum 
measurements makes fast spectrum sensing and system response possible.  
Several novel compressive spectrum sensing methods had been proposed. They could be 
roughly divided as single-CR approaches and multiple-CR approaches. For single-CR approaches, 
Tian and Giannakis [24] proposed to sense the wideband spectrum based on the concept of 
compressive sampling (CS) [25] for a single CR user. By finding the spectrum is usually sparse, 
the original wireless signals could be reconstructed even the problem formulation is

Combining (MRC) implemented for each relay node was proposed in [33], and it focused on 
maximizing the system throughput under the total sum power constraint and the individual power 
constraint respectively.  In [34], relay power allocation for maximizing the max-min rate and the 
weighted sum rate in multi-user relay networks was investigated, and the distributed 
implementation method has been proposed. However, only the power allocation for relay stations 
was considered.  In [35], algorithms were proposed to choose a set of cooperating relays to 
minimize the total transmission time of a fixed amount of data. An efficient convex relaxation 
approach was proposed in [36] to maximize user throughput while minimizing the total transmit 
power of relay nodes, and only the RS power allocation was considered.  All the above works 
focus on either max-throughput or fairness consideration, and some of them only consider power 
allocation for RS with fixed MS power. Besides the substantial studies of power allocation 
schemes for relay networks, energy-efficient communication has also been investigated in some 
literatures. Bits-per-energy efficiency has been studied in [37]. An energy-efficient design for 
maximizing ‘bits per joule’ for a single BS system was investigated in [38] [39]. In [40], a 
game-theoretic approach for maximizing energy efficiency, defined as ‘bits per energy’, in a 
user-cooperation network where one MS can transmit data collaboratively via another MS was 
proposed. In [41], a relay selection scheme for energy saving was proposed for a cooperative 
relay system where transmit data is beamformed by a set of relays. Both the objective and 
scenarios discussed in this work are different from those in [40] and [41]. In this work, we 
studied the joint power allocation for RS and MS and the relay selection problem under the 
constraint of limited RS transmit power in order to maximize the energy efficiency per user 
defined as ‘bits per joule’ for uplink transmission in an OFDMA Decode-and-Forward (DF) 
cooperative relay network. 
The increasing demand for spectrum resource lately has caused the so-called spectrum 
scarcity problem primarily due to the conventional approaches of static spectrum allocation. In 
fact, according to the regulations from FCC [42], a large portion of the priced frequency spectrum 
is underutilized in most of the time and location, i.e., known as spectrum holes. Consequently, 
cognitive radio (CR) for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been prevailing exploited for more 
efficient spectrum utilization over the licensed bands [43] such as the IEEE 802.22 [44] [45] 
standard. It is an emerging standard that allocates spectrums for TV broadcast services via a 
license exempt basis. The CR user (CRU), i.e., unlicensed user, is capable of sensing the channel 
condition and can adapt its internal parameters to access the licensed channels while these 
channels are not being utilized by the primary users (PUs), i.e, licensed users. In addition to the 
IEEE 802.22 standard which focused on specification for a centralized CR network, there are also 
a great number of research interested in decentralized DSA in multi-channel TDMA-based (i.e., 
time slotted-based) primary networks. The main focus is on how to design a medium access 
control (MAC) protocol to effectively exploit the channel availability under the overlay paradigm 
considering that both the PUs and CRUs cannot transmit simultaneously. 
 7 
channel-hopping sequence (OCS) based on dynamic programming (DP) is derived in order to 
achieve maximum aggregate throughput for the CRUs and average frame delay of the PUs with 
quality of service (QoS) guaranteed. Based on the proposed OCS scheme, optimal load balance 
can be achieved between the probability of channel availability and channel utilization within the 
CR network under the knowledge of frame arrival probabilities of PUs. Numerical results are also 
presented to illustrate that the prosed OCS approach is feasible to capture the rapidly varying 
opportunities of spectrum holes for the CRUs. 
Cognitive radio (CR) is a widely known opportunistic spectrum access technique for 
enhancing the cell-wide spectrum utilization efficiency [50] [51]. In order to detect the idle 
frequency band so as to gain the channel access, spectrum sensing performed at the CR users is 
indispensible. In the literature, the detection of idle spectrum is typically considered as a binary 
hypothesis test, and a commonly used signal model under both hypotheses is [50] [51]

where N is the length of the data record,  ,  ,   are, respectively, the signal of the primary user, 
the received signal at the CR terminal, and the measurement noise. The hypothesis model (1) 
implicitly assumes perfect synchronization between the primary transmitter and the CR receiver. 
Such an assumption, however, is not valid in many practical situations. For example, in an 
overlay femto cell network [52], the signal of the macro mobile subscriber, synchronized with the 
macro base station (BS), will arrive at a femto BS asynchronously. The spectrum detection at the 
femto BS is typically subject to timing misalignment of the primary signal [53] [54]. Also, in 
heavy-traffic networks in which primary users may dynamically enter the network, time delays 
observed in the sensing period is unavoidable, especially when a long sensing duration is adopted 
for obtaining good sensing performance. Thus, in the aforementioned cases, a more reasonable 
signal model for the binary hypothesis test is thus

sensing schemes in the literature focusing on the synchronized signal model (1) [50] [51], this 
paper considers the spectrum detection aimed for tackling signal timing uncertainty under the 
hypothesis (2). 
 
Among the existing spectrum sensing schemes, the energy detector (ED) [55] is quite

SUBPROJECT 1 
Traffic Scheduling and Control for Cooperative and Cognitive Radio 
Networks – Intelligent HARQ Scheme for HSDPA 
 System Model 
A. HSDPA Model 
In HSDPA, Node B controls the link adaptation and the fast physical retransmission 
combining instead of the radio network control [1]. The user data are transmitted on the 
HS-DSCH, which is multiplexed into the high-speed physical downlink shared channel. The 
HS-DSCH supports multicode transmission and code multiplexing of different users. The 
spreading factor for HS-DSCH is fixed at 16. However, the maximum number of codes that can 
be allocated to a user is 15, since the common channel reserves one code space. The modulation 
orders supported are quaternary phase-shift keying and 16-quadratic-amplitude modulation, and 
the coding scheme of HS-DSCH is turbo code. In this paper, the code rates of the turbo encoder 
are considered as {1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5} [11]. Therefore, there are in total ten kinds of MCS 
levels being chosen, as shown in Table I, where MCS level 10 can carry the highest data rate, 
whereas MCS level 1 can carry the lowest data rate, under the additive white Gaussian noise 
(AWGN). To achieve a short round trip delay and improve the tracking of fast channel variations, 
a packet transmission time interval (TTI) is specified as 2 ms. 
The physical layer control information is carried on the high-speed shared control channel. 
Each control information contains the channelization code set, the modulation scheme, the 
TABLE I – MCS LEVELS FOR THE HSDPA SYSTEM

Fig. 1. Functional blocks of the iHARQ scheme 
At every decision episode of the nth TTI, the iHARQ scheme selects the average BLER 
performance indication and the CQI, which is denoted by ( )BLER n  and ( )CQI n , respectively, 
as input linguistic variables to infer the suitable action of MCS level for the initial packet 
transmission. Thus, it has the input system state at the thn  TTI, which is denoted by ( )X n  and 
expressed as 
 ( )( ) ( ), ( )X n BLER n CQI n=  (5) 
It defines the output linguistic variable at the thn  TTI, which is denoted by ( )a n , as the 
MCS level expressed as 
 ( ) , 1, ,ka n MCS k K= = …  (6) 
Note that the smaller MCS level has better BLER performance but lower system throughput, and 
there are ten kinds of MCS levels ( 10)K =  for the HARQ control given in Table II. 
The functional block diagram of the iHARQ scheme is shown in Fig. 1. At the beginning of 
the nth episode of TTI, the input linguistic variables of the system state ( )X n = 
( )( ), ( )BLER n CQI n  are measured and transformed into fuzzy linguistic terms with their 
associated membership functions defined in the fuzzifier. According to these fuzzy linguistic 
terms, the Q -values can be obtained through the designed fuzzy rules in the fuzzy rule base. 
These Q -values are denoted by ( , )n j kq S MCS  for 1, ,j J= …  and 1, ,k K= … , where jS  is 
the thj  fuzzy linguistic term of ( )X n , 
k
MCS  is the thk  MCS level of ( )a n , J  is the total 
number of input linguistic terms (system states), and K  is the total number of output MCS level. 
Then, the optimal action *( )ja n  for each state–action pair j  can be inferred at the thn  episode 
of the TTI by the inference engine. The intensity of ( )X n  belonging to jS  , which is denoted 
by ,j nµ , is also yielded in this block. Finally, the optimal action *( )a n  can be obtained for the 
HSDPA system through the defuzzifier. Afterward, the reinforcement signal ( )r n  is then 
attained and fed back to the block of Q -function update, where the adjustment step of the  
 13
in the very safe (dangerous) region. 
The fuzzy term set for ( )CQI n  is defined as ( )( )T CQI n  = { 1 ( 1)Level L , 2 ( 2)Level L , 
3 ( 3)Level L , 4 ( 4)Level L , 5 ( 5)Level L , 6 ( 6)Level L , 7 ( 7)Level L , 8 ( 8)Level L , 
9 ( 9)Level L , 10 ( 10)Level L }. Each term in ( )( )T CQI n  stands for the status of one CQI and 
is denoted by one kind of 10 MCS levels adopted to guarantee *BLER  during this CQI region. 
Each term B  in ( )CQI n  has a membership function denoted by ( )( )B CQI nµ , B = 1L , 
2L , …, or 10L . As shown in Fig. 3, ( )( )Li CQI nµ , 2, , 9i = …  is a triangular function with 
center at iB  and left (right) width 1i iB B −−  ( 1i iB B+ − ); ( )1 ( )L CQI nµ  ( ( )10 ( )L CQI nµ ) is a 
trapezoidal function with right (left) edge at 1B  ( 10B ) and right (left) width 1B  ( 10 9B B− ). The 
kB , for 1, ,k K= … , is set to be the required CQI value to maintain 
*BLER  for kMCS , and 
1 1B =  and 3kB k= × , for 2, , 10k = … . There are 30J =  kinds of linguistic terms (states) in 
( )X n , and jS  , 1 j J≤ ≤ , and ( ) ( )( )( ) , ( )A BBLER n CQI nµ µ  are the outputs to the fuzzy rule 
base and the inference engine, respectively. 
B. Fuzzy Rule Base 
The fuzzy rule base emulates the memory of humans reacting to the environment. Each 
fuzzy rule j  for the thj  linguistic term in the fuzzy rule base 1 j J≤ ≤  is designed as 
 Rule : if ( ) is , then ( ) is with ( , ), for 1j k n j kj X n S a n MCS q S MCS k K≤ ≤  (7) 
The ( , )n j kq S MCS  denotes the Q -value of the state–action pair ( , )j kS MCS  and will be 
reported to the inference engine. To accelerate the learning procedure, we divide the fuzzy rule 
base into green, yellow, and red parts according to the fuzzy term of ( )BLER n .Within each part, 
the candidate set forMCS selection is determined by the fuzzy term of ( )CQI n . 
Green Part:  
If ( )BLER n  is Green  and ( )CQI n  is Level m , then ( )a n  is kMCS  with 
nq ( ( )BLER n  is Green , ( )CQI n  is Level m , kMCS ), k m> . In this part, since the 
value of ( )BLER n  is much smaller than the BLER requirement *BLER , the MCS 
selection should be more aggressive to enhance the system throughput. Thus, only 
kMCS  with k m>  are taken into account. Note that the MCS with larger level can 
transmit more information bits. 
Yellow Part:  
If ( )BLER n  is Yellow  and ( )CQI n  is Level m , then ( )a n  is kMCS  with 
nq ( ( )BLER n  is Yellow , ( )CQI n  is Level m , kMCS ), 1 1m k m− ≤ ≤ + . In this 
part, since the BLER performance is around *BLER , it is better to keep the BLER 
performance unchanged. Hence, only kMCS  with 1, , and 1k m m m= − +  are 
considered as candidate actions.

However, the value of *( )a n  may be a real number, whereas the actual output value should 
be an integer. Therefore, the final output action *( )a n  is to round off *( )a n  in (50) to obtain an 
integer value. 
D. Q-Function Update 
The Q -function update emulates the learning process of humans with interactions of the 
environment. It generates *( , ( ))n jq S a n∆  to update the Q -value in the fuzzy rule base. The 
input of the Q -function update is the reinforcement signal ( )r n , which is derived according to 
the transmission results of the iHARQ scheme in the HSDPA system. The Q -value update for 
each state–action pair by the reinforcement signal will be performed when every packet 
transmission is finished. Each rule in the same part of the fuzzy rule base will have the same 
reinforcement signal to generate the Q -value to reward the selected MCS level. 
For the green part, the MCS level selection would be more aggressive to maximize the 
system throughput. The reinforcement signal at the nth TTI is designed here according to the 
results of both initial transmission and retransmissions and given as

( )

 (12) 
where kR  is the number of information bits in the transmitted packet with kMCS , and ,d kR  is 
the summation of redundant bits in the initial transmission and in the retransmission. Notice that 
( )BLER n  decreases only when the initial packet is successfully received without retransmission. 
The retransmission increases ( )BLER n ; however, the throughput is also increased. Therefore, to 
achieve aggressive MCS selection, the selected MCS level is here enforced when the packet is 
successfully received without regard to either initial transmission or retransmission. It can be 
expected that the higher the ratio of information bits to the total transmitted bits, the larger the 
reward feedback. However, as the retransmission occurs, the reward will be decreased since ,d kR  
increases. If the reception of this packet failed after three retransmissions, then this packet will be 
dropped, and a severe punishment will be given by letting ( ) 10r n = − . 
For the yellow part, the MCS level would be selected to keep the BLER performance 
unchanged. Hence, the reinforcement signal is defined as 
 17
where *( ( ), ( ))nQ X n a n  is the Q Q-value for the state–action pair 
*( ( ), ( ))X n a n , which is the 
weighted summation of *( , ( ))n j jq S a n , for 1, ,j J= …  by using the rule intensity ,j nµ  of

Finally, the procedure of the iHARQ scheme is summarized as follows. 
Step 1: 
Transform the received input variables ( ) ( ( ), ( ))X n BLER n CQI n=  into a fuzzy

the fuzzy rule base. 
Step 3:

Step 5:  
Derive the reinforcement signal ( )r n  by (12), (13), or (14) from the HSDPA system 
and calculate the adjustment value of the Q -value ( )*, ( )n jq S a n∆  by (15) in the 
Q -function update. 
Step 6: Update the Q-value by (8) in the fuzzy rule base.

Finally, we explain the proposed SMC method to numerically estimate P(XK|CZ1:K) and track the 
dynamic sampling rate over time. 
A. Compressive spectrum sensing (CS) for a local CR 
Before the inference process in (18), the detection of channel statuses in local CRs should be 
determined. Many previous single-CR approaches could be applied to achieve the goal. In our 
system, due to the robustness, we adopt the compressive sensing method proposed by Polo et al. 
[26] to reconstruct the spectrum; exploit the wavelet-based edge detector [27] to identify the 
number of channels and their frequency ranges; finally apply an energy-based detection method 
[58] to determine the channel status. Based on the process, we could indentify the channel 
number N and the frequency range of each channel directly. Also, we could systematically 
determine the channel statuses. Due to the limited space, we only briefly explain this process.

, the ith CR 
senses Si=R(x

) samples instead of SNyq samples and generates a compressed autocorrelation 
vector rC with size 2Six1. In [24], it showed that the edge spectrum En, which is the derivative of 
the power spectrum density (PSD) Fn, presents the sparse property. Based on the CS theory [26] 
[27], we can formulate an l1-norm optimization problem and recover the edge spectrum En.

 The formulation of the preference prior  
Beside the temporal prior, we still applied the preference prior P(XK) of the sampling rate for 
the optimal solution finding. Intuitively, our system prefers a smaller sampling rate for efficiency. 
Hence, the preference prior is P(XK) is designed to be a linear function as  
 P(XK)= sXK +Offset, (24) 
where s = -0.01 is a predefined slope of the linear function; Offset is determined by the 
normalization process to make the probability summation of P(XK) equal to 1. Note that the 
interesting range of sampling rates is [0, XNyq]. With the preference prior P(XK), the proposed 
system tends to search the minimum sampling rate while preserving the accuracy.

Protocol Architecture and QoS Management for Cooperative and Cognitive

A. System Model and Assumptions 
Let  denote the received signal transmitted by MS ni on subcarrier k to node rj at 
time t, which means the t
th
 two-time-slot transmission period.  denotes signal with unit 
energy transmitted by MS ni on subcarrier k. Let  denote the transmit power of MS ni on 
subcarrier k to receiving node rj, and denote the fading coefficient for the channel (link) 
between MS ni and node rj over subcarrier k. Then, the received signal  in time t can be 
written as:

n k n k n k n k n ks t p t h t x t n t= +  (27) 
where  denotes the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at node rj. 
During a two-time-slot transmission period, since MSs via direct link would actively transmit 
data in both time slots while MSs via relay link would only transmit data in the first time slot, a 
fair comparison on the achievable rate should be measured in a per time slot basis, and the 
normalization to one time slot should be done to have equal consumed energy for MS with 
relaying and MS without relaying. Thus, the achievable rate in bits/sec/Hz for the direct link 
between BS node r1 and source node ni on subcarrier k is:

For the relay link (MS-RS-BS), MS ni transmits data to relay node rj in the first time slot, and 
relay node rj transmits it to BS node r1 in the second time slot. BS node r1 receives two scaled 
packets with the same data and combines them by applying the maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) 
scheme. Therefore, the achievable rate for the MRC relay link can be expressed as:

In this section, we present the optimal transmit power for MS via direct (MS-BS) link for 
maximizing the energy efficiency. It’s not hard to see and has already been shown that Eq. (7) is a 
strictly quasi-concave function. Therefore, given that L subcarriers are assigned to MS ni 
transmitted to BS node r1 via direct link, a unique global optimal power vector

(MS-RS-BS) Link 
The problem of finding the optimal power allocation to maximize energy efficiency for relay 
link is more complex. In that case, power allocation for both MS ni and RS node rj should be 
jointly considered. By substituting Eq. (30), (32), and (33) into Eq. (35), we have

Now, we can know from Eq. (38) that the larger relay transmit power, , is allocated,

The constraint (49) limits the total transmit power of relay node rj not to exceed , 
where  can be obtained from Eq. (44). The constraint (50) implies that each subcarrier 
must be assigned to only one MS during a two-time-slot period to avoid inter-subcarrier 
interference. Let  denote the assignment indicator, which represents 1 while subcarrier k is 
assigned to node rj linked with MS ni, and represent 0 otherwise, and the constraint (51) implies 
the subcarrier assigned to relay node rj should be the same as the subcarrier assigned to MS ni 
during a two-time-slot period. The constraint (50) and (51) also imply that a subcarrier can only 
be assigned to one relay node for RS-BS link during a two-time-slot period because the constraint 
(50) would not be satisfied due to the constraint (51) if a subcarrier is assigned to more than one 
relay node. 
 29
which means a MS transmits via relay link. Also, the allocation would follow the constraint (50) 
~ (51), and the corresponding RS transmit power, , in Eq. (50) can be obtained from Eq. 
(18). No more subcarrier should be assigned to a relay node during that transmission period if the 
total transmit power of that relay node reaches its upper bound, . If a subcarrier is assigned 
to  pair (direct link), that means the same subcarrier would be assigned in both time slots 
due to the assumption of same channel condition during a two time-slot period.

 System Model 
Both the primary and the CR networks are slotted systems with the same slot duration Ts, in 
which the CR network is depicted as the dotted vertical lines in Fig. 7. Due to imperfect 
synchronization, the time difference between these two networks can be observed at the starting 
epoches, i.e., in Fig. 1, at the beginning of each slot as 2 1t t t∆ = − . For the primary network with 
M  identical bandwidth channels, each of them is occupied by a PU independently with 
Bernoulli arrival process [40] with the probability iλ  of one frame arrival and the probability 
1 iλ−  of no frame arrival at the starting epochs for 1, 2, ,i M= … . It is noted that infinite queue 
capacity is assumed for each channel, where the frame duration is equal to a slot length. Given 
that the PUs will retransmit until success, i.e., no collisions happened to a frame.

III. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 
SUBPROJECT 1 
Traffic Scheduling and Control for Cooperative and Cognitive Radio 
Networks – Intelligent HARQ Scheme for HSDPA 
The iHARQ scheme is compared with two conventional adaptive HARQ schemes. The first 
scheme is the ATS scheme [8]. The ATS scheme adaptively sets the SINR threshold for each 
MCS level. After each transmission, the thresholds that are close to the SINR of the last 
transmission will be increased (decreased) if the transmission fails (succeeds). The increasing 
step of the threshold adjustment for the failed transmission is set to be *0.1 (1 )BLER× − , 
whereas the decreasing step for the successful transmission is set to be *0.05 BLER× . The 
second scheme is the QL-based HARQ (QL-HARQ) scheme [11]. The QL-HARQ scheme uses 
the QL algorithm to learn an optimal policy in both link adaptation and HARQ retransmission 
version. The transmission cost is defined as   2(( ( , ) ( )) ( ))k k k kSINR x a SINR a SINR a− , where 
( , )k kSINR x a  is the received SINR at UE for the state kx  with action ka , and 
 ( )kSINR a  is 
the required SINR with action ka . After learning, the QL-HARQ scheme will choose the MCS 
where the SINR threshold is closest to the received SINR. 
To evaluate the performance, we define an HSDPA service power ratio (HSPR) as the 
transmission power allocated to HS-DSCH over the total transmission power of Node B for the 
performance analysis. If the value of HSPR for a Node B is small, then it might not guarantee the 
BLER requirement for the UE in bad channel condition. 
 
Fig. 8. Average computation time 
 37
Fig. 9 shows the BLER performance measure versus HSPR. It can be seen that the BLER 
performances of the three compared schemes are always satisfied. The reason for this is that the 
iHARQ scheme intends to enhance the system throughput as well as guarantee the BLER 
performance via the FQL algorithm. When ( )BLER n  is lower than the BLER requirement, the 
iHARQ scheme takes an aggressive action by selecting a higher MCS level to enhance the system 
throughput but would increase the ( )BLER n . When ( )BLER n  is over the BLER requirement, 
the iHARQ scheme selects a conservative action by choosing a lower MCS level to decrease 
( )BLER n . Hence, the iHARQ scheme can maintain the BLER performance just below the BLER 
requirement. On the other hand, the QL-HARQ scheme adjusts the Q -value according to the 
received SINR and the required SINR, which is too sensitive to the fast varying channel condition. 
This makes the QL-HARQ scheme adopt a conservative action and have the best BLER 
performance. The ATS scheme adjusts the SINR thresholds only based on the ACK/NACK 
information, which is also too sensitive to the fast varying channel condition. However, since the 
adjustment step is fixed, the ATS scheme has higher BLER performance than the QL-HARQ 
scheme. 
Fig. 10 presents the packet dropping ratio versus HSPR. In the simulation, if a packet failed 
to be decoded after three retransmissions, then this packet will be dropped. It can be found that 
the ATS (QL-HARQ) scheme has the largest (smallest) packet dropping ratio, and the iHARQ 
scheme is in the middle. The iHARQ scheme has the packet dropping rate in the middle, but it 
still achieves the largest system throughput and has the highest BLER performance. It is because 
the iHARQ scheme chooses a more aggressive but safe MCS to enhance system throughput, and 
a higher MCS level carries more information bits. This safe MCS selection makes the iHARQ 
scheme have a higher probability of successfully decoding a packet after retransmission.

erroneously transmitted packets would make the BLER performance metric become high. At this 
condition, the iHARQ scheme can take a more conservative action to quickly recover the BLER 
performance in a few iterations. It can be seen that the iHARQ achieves the best convergence 
performance. After 90 iterations, the iHARQ scheme converges the learning process and keeps 
the BLER performance guaranteed under the BLER requirement. On the other hand, the 
QL-HARQ scheme needs about 180 iterations to attain the BLER performance to fulfill the 
requirement since it adjusts the Q -value only based on the received SINR and the required  
SINR. This cannot provide enough information about BLER for the QL-HARQ scheme to

a fixed sampling rate such as Nyquist rate or sub-Nyquist rate, our system could look for the 
optimal balance between system accuracy and efficiency. A quantitative evaluation of system 
accuracy and efficiency are listed in Table II. Here, we measure the status detection accuracy 
(ACC) to assess the system accuracy defined as  
 
True occupied channel detection + True free channel detection
Total channel number  Sensing indices number
ACC =
×
 (75) 
Besides, we calculate the average sensing rate (ASR) during different periods with different spare 
levels to assess the system efficiency. Here, we use the Nyquist rate of our transmitted signal as 
the reference unit. 
In summary, we find the sparse level of the environment spectrum is not static but 
time-varying. To adapt to the dynamic changing, we proposed an adjustment scheme for dynamic 
sampling rate selection. The stochastic process of varying spare levels is modeled as a dynamic 
system, and the optimal dynamic rate selection is treated as a tracking problem. By combining 
SMC-based tracking concept into a distributed compressive spectrum sensing framework, the 
optimal sampling rate is well tracked and the free channels are well determined under the 
proposed method.

Fig. 15 and 16 shows the proposed MaxEE scheme and the exhaustive search achieve the best 
energy efficiency performance. Fig. 16 is the outcome of normalizing the results of Fig. 15 with 
the best performance curve in Fig. 15, so the best curve in Fig. 15 has unity performance. The 
MaxEE scheme obtains very similar performance with a much-lower complexity as compared to 
the exhaustive search. It is also shown that the energy efficiency can be improved in the range of 
15% to 30% by the deployment of relay nodes. In addition, the proposed scheme outperforms the

the queue of a channel becomes unstable. The quantized level p∆  for searching OCS is set as 
0.001, which is accurate enough to obtain the proposed OCS in the simulation settings. Moreover, 
two conventional channelhopping sequences are also simulated for comparison purpose as 
follows: (a) uniform channel-hopping sequence (UCS) with the probability 1
i
p M=  for i = 1, 
2, ...,M, and (b) proportional channel-hopping sequence (PCS) with channel hopping probabilities 
proportioning to the complement of iλ . It is designed according to the situation that smaller 
frame arrival probability is assumed to result in larger channel availability, which can be written 
as

Fig. 19 shows that the proposed OCS can provide higher aggregate throughput compared to 
the other channel-hopping sequences since it can exactly exploit the potential throughput in 
multiple channels. It is interesting to note that the aggregate throughput in OCS will saturate after 
exceeding a certain number of CRPs while the number of the CRPs is large enough to utilize each 
channel with optimal throughput. In general, the design concept arises from assigning additional 
CRPs into the virtual channel in order to reduce collision with the PU.  
On the other hand, as show in Fig. 20, the aggregate frame delay of primary network can 
also be guaranteed by adopting the proposed OCS approach. As a result, even though the delay 
constraints is not taken into consideration, the OCS still can ensure the QoS requirement of the 
PUs to a certain level. In order to provide tighter QoS requirement for the PUs, the case with 
constraints , 2c iD =  for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are also shown in both Figs. 19 and 20. The effect with

effectively reduces the interference among the users in CCRN. Furthermore, Subproject 3 
proposed an energy efficient resource allocation and relay selection scheme for OFDMA-based 
cooperative relay networks. A low complexity subcarrier power allocation and relay selection 
scheme is designed for maximizing energy efficiency. Subproject 4 build the model for the 
dynamic environment of cognitive network. They utilized the game theory to describe the 
cognitive network and derive the optimal power allocation scheme for users by maximizing the 
designed utility function. 
To sum up, in this integrated project, the cooperation among the five subproject teams 
indeed benefit out research achievements. The DSA-related research results not only enhance the 
spectrum utilization of CCRN, but also ensure the robustness of the proposed algorithms from 
other subprojects. The DSS-related research provide good solutions to the interference problem 
between primary-network and CR users, thus make the discussions of the schemes related to 
DSM can be carried out smoothly. We believe those valuable achievements from this integrated 
project must benefit the communication industry.
