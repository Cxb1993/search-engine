model is applied to investigate the multi-response 
quality problem for the IC packaging process. The IC 
packaging process plays a key role in improving the 
IC product quality. The quality responses for the IC 
packaging process are multi-dimensional and varied. 
How to effectively investigate the multi-response 
quality problem for finding an optimum parameter 
combination for the IC packaging process is a 
challenging and valuable task. In this study, the 
developed stochastic super-efficiency DEA model is 
used for completely ranking those decision making 
units (DMUs) with input/output data having 
probability distribution and co-variance 
relationship. Besides, sensitivity analysis is used 
to investigate the impact of changes in significant 
level on ranking DMUs. A local IC packaging foundry 
provides real-world experimental data for case study. 
Finally the developed stochastic DEA model is used to 
solve the multi-response quality problem and obtain 
an optimum parameter combination using these 
experimental data. The proposed approach can be 
expected to apply to other industries for solving the 
multi-response quality problem.

1. Introduction 
 
The main issue is how to resolve the multi-response quality problem resulting from producing IC 
components and products. In many traditional manufacturing processes, the selection of control 
parameters in design of experiments and quality control is usually determined by plant engineers 
using some rules of thumb from their experiences or trial and error tests. For some high-tech 
industries such as IC packaging processes, it is not possible to obtain a good combination of control 
parameters without applying reliable design of experiments and analyzing experimental data. One 
reason is that in high-tech industries the manufacturing processes are increasingly complicated and 
the factors affecting the product quality are not limited in one or two quality characteristics. 
In the IC industry, the packaging processes play a key role to determining the quality of the IC 
components and products. The quality problem in the IC packaging processes is changeable and 
typical of multiple responses in nature. The data collected from experiments are always 
probabilistic in nature. It is desirable to investigate the multi-response quality problem for the IC 
packaging processes using probabilistic-based optimization techniques. Then, a satisfactory 
combination of control parameters may be obtained to meet the demand for quality and competitive 
advantages. 
Recently, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been applied to cope with multi-response 
quality problems with certain expected results. Still, some conventional DEA methods cannot 
provide complete ranking results for possible combinations of parameters. Not to mention the 
capability for dealing with the issues of covariance effect among quality responses and probabilistic 
nature in experimental data. Thereby, it is imperative to develop a desirable DEA model that can 
simultaneously consider probabilistic and covariance effect problems while providing complete 
ranking results. 
In this study, the multi-response quality problem for IC packaging processes will be 
investigated and analyzed for the selection of control parameters and response factors. Taguchi 
method will be used to design robust experiments using the selected control factors. Experimental 
data for response factors will be collected. A stochastic super-efficiency DEA model will be 
proposed for dealing with probabilistic output data while providing complete ranking results. 
Sensitivity analysis will be performed to show the sensitivity of ranking results to changes in 
probability distribution. Finally, a satisfactory combination of control parameters and levels will be 
obtained using the signal-to-noise ratio additive model. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was proposed by Charnes et al. (1978) by formulating an 
input-based, constant return to scale DEA model. The DEA model they built has been coined as the 
CCR model. Their efforts initiated a study of performance measure method and modeling. Later, 
Banker et al. (1984) extended the CCR model to formulate an output-based, variable return to scale 
DEA model, the so-called BCC model. Cooper et al. (2007) did an extensive literature review 
6 
proposed multiple response optimization using mixture-designed experiments and desirability 
functions in semiconductor scheduling. Su and Tong (1997) and Fung and Kang (2005) applied 
principal components technique to solve Taguchi method for multiple responses optimization 
problems. The principal components technique converts all the interrelated response factors into a 
few independent components and provides a satisfactory combination of factors and levels for 
parameter design. The main weakness of principal components might lie in the fact that it tries to 
interpret the whole variation using small variance. Its effort is not enough to fully explain the 
variation in the multi-response problem. Hsieh et al. (2005) adopted statistical regression and 
fitness function for optimizing multi-response problems. Reddy et al. (1997) unified robust design 
and goal programming for multi-response optimization problems. Yang and Tseng (2002) and Goel 
et al. (2007) combined response surface optimization and goal programming approach to solve for 
multi-response problems in integrated-circuit ink marking problems. In fact, no goal-programming 
problem was actually solved in their method. Koksoy (2008) presented a nonlinear programming 
model using mean square deviation function and devised a generalized decent gradient algorithm 
for solving parameter combination problems. Tong and Su (1997) solved a multi-response design 
problem using a multiple-attribute decision-making method. They considered the quality loss of 
each response and adopted a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) 
to optimize the multi-response design problem. Later, Yang and Chou (2005) applied TOPSIS 
method to find an optimal parameter combination by assigning and normalizing a surrogate 
objective function for each response. Tarng et al. (2000), Lin et al. (2000), and Chien et al. (2008) 
applied fuzzy logic methods for solving multi-response problems. Lin and Lin (2002) and Chiang 
and Hsieh (2009) used orthogonal array with grey relational analysis to optimize the multi-response 
problem in color filter manufacturing. Recently, several scholars tried to integrate artificial neural 
network with other methods to solve multi-response problems. For instance, Hsieh and Tong (2001) 
applied artificial neural network method for optimizing multiple responses involving qualitative and 
quantitative characteristics in integrated-circuit manufacturing. Li et al. (2003) used a novel 
neural-genetic algorithm for parameter selection. Hou et al. (2008) used neural networks and 
immune algorithm to find optimum parameters for an integrated-circuit wire bonding process. 
Liao and Chen (2002) proposed data envelopment analysis for optimizing multi-response 
problems in the Taguchi method in the hope of reducing uncertainty and smoothing away the 
weakness in principal components technique. Liao (2004) applied both neural networks and data 
envelopment analysis to optimizing multi-response problems. Gutierrez and Lozano (2009) used 
artificial neural networks to enumerate all possible combinations of factors and then applied data 
envelopment analysis to selecting the best combination. The merit of this approach is to reduce 
uncertainty and complexity arising in subjective judgments. However, the approach of their data 
envelopment analysis didn’t consider the stochastic nature and variation rooted in each response 
characteristic during experiment and the resulting probability distribution. 
The study for the quality problems in integrated-circuit packaging processes plays a key role 
to improving the integrated-circuit product quality. Sheaffer et al. (1987) applied design of 
experiments for copper bonding process using ball shear strength and copper wire pull strength as

Efficient DMUs have an index equal to or less than 1. It represents the maximum possible 
proportional decrease in an output vector retaining DMU efficiency. Inefficient DMUs are 
assigned an index of efficiency greater than 1, which could be interpreted as the minimum 
increase in output vector that is required to make a DMU efficient. It is worth emphasizing that 
we can solve the proposed super-efficiency model to find efficient DMUs as well as rank them. 
This derives from the fact that efficient DMUs have efficiency score less than or equal to 1.  
The conventional DEA models don’t allow stochastic variations in input and output. To 
remove this weakness in the conventional DEA models, some scholars incorporated stochastic 
input and output variations into the DEA models (Huang and Li, 1996; Cooper et al., 2004; 
Khodabakhshi and Asgharian, 2009; and Khodabakhshi, 2009).  
In this study, stochastic version of the output-oriented super-efficiency model will be 
proposed, which allows for the consideration of stochastic variations in output data. Following 
Cooper et al. (2004), let )~,...,~(~ sjijj yyy  be random output related to ),...,1(, njDMU j  . 
Suppose that all output components are jointly normally distributed. The stochastic version of 
the super-efficiency DEA model may be expressed as follows.

current and still remain efficient. Hence, the lower the sup*o is, the better the DMUo will be. 
The deterministic equivalent of the stochastic super-efficiency model can be obtained by the use

4. Sensitivity Analysis 
 
Sensitivity analysis can be used to examine the sensitivity of efficient DMUs to changes of 
different significant levels. There are two approaches to sensitivity analysis in DEA. One is to allow 
all data for all DMUs to be varied simultaneously until at least one DMU changes its status from

Figure 1: IC packaging processes 
 
   Among those processes, wire bonding and molding are the two most influential processes on the 
quality of IC packaging. In this study, wire bonding and molding processes will be analyzed to find 
suitable control and response factors. Then, the developed stochastic super efficiency data 
envelopment analysis model will be used to optimize the multi-response problem for 
integrated-circuit packaging processes. 
 
Wire Bonding Process 
Figure 2 shows the procedure of wire bonding process. The procedure of wire bonding process 
consists of loading, indexing, clamping, heating, searching, EFO ball formation, ultrasonic bonding, 
wire looping, fish tail formation, repeating, and off-loading.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Wire bonding process 
 
The aim of wire bonding process is to connect the pad on a chip to the inner lead of lead frame 
with thin gold wire (18-50 μm) and then transmit circuit signals of IC chips outward. When the lead 
frame is positioned within the magazine, the digital image processing technology is applied to 
inspect the connection and position of each pad with inner lead. Once the inspection is complete, 
the wire bonding process is initiated. Figure 3 displays the detailed bonding.  
In the wire bonding process, the first bond is referred to the pad on a chip and the second bond 
to the inner lead in the lead frame. When processing the wire bonding, the end point of the gold 
wire is heated up to form a ball bond and then the ball bond is pressed into the capillary at the first 
bond, as shown in Figure 3. The other side of gold wire is then pulled out and extended to connect 
to the inner lead through a scheduled path and pressed onto the second bond. At the same time, the 
connecting segment of gold-wire between the capillary and the second bond is then cut off. That

Selection of control factors and response factors 
The selection of control factors that are used to design experiments for wire bonding and 
molding processes is made according to results from literature review and suggestions of shop-floor 
engineers. There will be seven control factors in designing experiments, including wire-bonding 
force, wire-bonding temperature, wire-bonding time, ultrasonic energy, clamping pressure, mold 
temperature, and waiting time after molding. Among these control factors, wire-bonding force, 
wire-bonding temperature, wire-bonding time and ultrasonic energy are associated with the wire 
bonding process, while clamping pressure, mold temperature, and waiting time after molding are 
related with the molding process. Wire-bonding force, wire-bonding temperature, and ultrasonic 
energy exhibit a high degree of impacts on the gold wire and lead frame by inter-metallic formation. 
The length of wire-bonding time will affect the adhesion force of gold wire. For the mold 
temperature, the higher the temperature is, the sooner the epoxy compound cures. On the other hand, 
if the mold temperature is too low, it is not easy for a mold to fill to the full with epoxy compound. 
The waiting time after molding can cause delay for the operation time and decrease of throughput. 
However, if the waiting time after molding is too short, the cladding of chip with epoxy compound 
will be unstable and vulnerable to loose. 
There will be at least three response factors to be observed and collected from this experiment. 
The response factors to be observed and collected will be wire pull strength, ball shear strength, and 
wire sweep. Wire pull strength and ball shear strength are the larger-the-best responses. Wire sweep 
is used to measure the degree of gold wire deviation using X-ray test and is the smallest-the-best 
response.  
 
6. Results of Solving Multi-Response Quality Problem by Stochastic DEA 
 
Procedures to solving the multi-response quality problem in IC packaging processes is proposed 
by the application of stochastic super-efficiency DEA model and Taguchi design method. First, the 
control factors and response factors are selected for the experiment of IC packaging 
multi-response quality problem. Then, Taguchi’s 1 7
18L (2 3 )  orthogonal table is used to 
determine the possible combinations of control factors and the associated levels. Real-world 
experimental data of response characteristics is collected for each combination and 
super-efficiency DEA model is applied. The approach is summarized as follows. 
 
Step 1: Selection of control factors and response characteristics 
Seven control factors and three response characteristics for designing IC packaging quality 
experiments are selected and used for experiments. The control factors are wire-bonding force, 
wire-bonding temperature, wire-bonding time, ultrasonic energy, clamping pressure, mold 
temperature, and waiting time after molding, while the response characteristics are wire pull 
strength, ball shear strength, and wire sweep. 
 
Step 2: Application of Taguchi orthogonal table 
Orthogonal tables are the most important tool in parameter design. The selection of suitable 
orthogonal table relies on the product feature, number of factors, and number of levels. In this study, 
Taguchi’s 1 7
18(2 3 )L   orthogonal table is used to determine the possible combinations of control 
factors and levels, as shown in Table 1. The 1 7
18(2 3 )L   orthogonal table has least number of 
treatments to account for more than seven three-level control factors. 
 
Step 3: Data collection for response characteristics 
Experimental data for response characteristics are collected for each 18 experimental scenarios. 
For each experimental scenario, there are 12 replications of experiment to reflect the sampling 
variability for each response. Eighteen sets of response data as well as the corresponding control 
factors and levels are obtained. We assume that each experimental scenario is performed 
18 
is performed under different levels of significance. The optimization software, AIMMS, is utilized 
for developing the formulated stochastic super-efficiency DEA model and providing optimal 
solutions. Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 provide ranking results of each test by setting α= 0.5, 0.4, 0.25, and 
0.75, respectively. Theψ 0
super
  values obtained for each scenario can be used to indicate which 
scenario is efficient or non-efficient. The scenario is stochastically efficient if the associated ψ 0
super
  
value is less than or equal to one.  
According to Theorem 1, for 5.0 , the results provided in Table 3 are obtained from the 
deterministic DEA model. Table 3 suggests that three scenarios are stochastically efficient in the 
deterministic case. That means scenarios 6, 15, and 18 are stochastically efficient when we assume 
the variance values are zeros.  
According to Theorem 2, for 5.00  , the number of stochastically efficient scenarios 
obtained from the deterministic model is smaller than or equal to that obtained from the stochastic 
model. Table 4 shows that six scenarios are stochastically efficient atα= 0.4, and Table 5 shows 
that thirteen scenarios are stochastically efficient atα= 0.25. Also, the number of stochastically 
efficient scenarios increases as the level of significance reduces. 
According to Theorem 3, for 15.0  , the number of stochastically efficient scenarios 
obtained from the deterministic model is larger than or equal to that obtained from the stochastic 
model. Table 6 shows that non scenarios are stochastically efficient atα= 0.75

Table 7 summarizes the ranking results for five differentαvalues. The ranking results vary as 
the level of significance changes. The larger the deviation from α= 0.5, the bigger the difference 
of ranking results is. Either the smaller significant level or the larger significant level implies 
greater variability in the response values from experiments, which in turn suggests the difficulty for 
obtain a satisfactory combination of control factors. Most of experiments for designing satisfactory 
combinations of control factors are tended to adopt a deterministic model or assumption by 
calculating mean values and setting zero variance. If the variability of the observed response 
outcomes is significantly large, then the selection of satisfactory combinations of control factors can 
be missed the target.

的發展方向與命脈所在，許多專家與學者皆視為第三次工業革命之啟動關鍵所在，因此該公
司不但在本身的研發上要搶得先機，也要在客戶中創造這方面的需求，促成商機。 
大會所預期達成的結果是整合製造與資訊系統之新構思、新邏輯、及新內涵，即所謂數
位化製造之發展方向。會議的焦點是針對製造自動化與資訊系統之整合過程所需之資訊科
技、網際網路、資訊系統及組織發展等應用。其主旨乃為在二十一世紀來臨之際，許多學者
專家正為資訊科技快速發展之良機，思索如何進一步將製造工程、自動化與資訊系統結合這
種科技與趨勢，發展出更輝煌之成果。尤其是在全球傳播科技日新月異之際，如何透過全球
資訊通訊科技來加強各國之間的科技合作與交流，是一件刻不容緩之課題。 
製造工程與資訊系統領域之崛起，即所謂的數位化製造（Digital Manufacturing），有可
能促成第三次工業革命，不論是在國內或國外，不過是最近一﹑二十年的事情，基本上是肇
因於自由市場的興起﹑私營企業規模不斷的擴張﹑企業經營策略的不斷求新求變、與全球化
之趨勢而形成的一門領域。從早期傳統的生產製造轉型成企業系統管理，及至目前以資訊通
訊科技和網際網路為基礎的工業與電腦系統之領域。雖然如此，製造工程、自動化與資訊系
統的理論與技術仍然不斷的受到興起中的趨勢發展要素的衝擊，包括顧客、電子化服務、組
織文化、員工、企業科技與一般科技，而試圖力求銳變，這一切的發展將會隨著資訊通訊產
業突飛猛進、網際網路的盛行、和企業競爭壓力而不斷進展，因此在學術界過去幾年所倡導
的製造工程、自動化與資訊系統理論與方法，都需要經過多次的檢討修正或甚至被揚棄。 
目前製造工程、自動化與資訊系統技術領域在芬蘭的學術界或實務界都有相當快速的進
展，透過整個製造工程、資訊系統與自動化技術，特別是藉助資訊通訊科技與電子商務的推
展而達成新的成就。另一方面又考慮到芬蘭在國情﹑民情﹑商情的不同，設法依其特性之不
同，設計出多種不同的製造工程、自動化技術與資訊技術，特別是資訊通訊基礎建設之完
備、網際網路基礎建設之普及、政府組織之再造、與民間企業電子化之推動。  
目前國內製造工程、自動化技術與資訊系統技術領域，大致上可分為以傳統製造業為主
之製造生產﹑以電子業為主之運籌管理、以及以網際網路為主之產業電子化等類型。表面上
這些不同類型之行業在實務上似乎沒有任何關連或相通之處，然而從學理的角度來分析，卻
可以歸納出相當多的雷同，可發現這些不同類型的行業，皆面臨相當多的類似問題，如快速
顧客反應﹑縮短訂單週期時間﹑各種商情資訊之共享與應用﹑資訊網路的應用、產業電子化
之推動等。因此許多傳統之經營理念與技術，經過不斷的在實務上嘗試檢驗與淘汰。為加速

alternatives cannot be certain or crisp under fuzzy environments, such decision problems can be fuzzy in nature 
qualitatively and quantitatively. Those fuzzy MADA problems need the use of fuzzy set theory and related soft 
computing techniques for resolution. 
There are several methods that can be used for solving MADA problems, such as simple additive weight, technique 
for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), elimination et choice translating reality (ELECTRE), 
analytic hierarchy process (AHP), weighted product, median ranking, linear assignment, hierarchical additive 
weighting, and the like [19]. Among those methods, the TOPSIS method exhibits several features, such as flexibility, 
robust, stability, and so on, that can be applied to deal with the fuzzy multi-response quality problems. In this study, the 
fuzzy TOPSIS is proposed to investigate the multi-response quality problems in wafer fabrication process. The 
motivation is that the fuzzy TOPSIS method can take advantage of normalizing and defuzzifying fuzzy data collected 
from multi-response quality problems and utilizes fuzzy entropy measures to provide objective weights for each 
criterion [18]. Furthermore, the fuzzy TOPSIS method can be integrated with Taguchi method to develop an exact 
procedure for obtaining satisfactory combinations of parameters. 
The objectives of this study are three-fold. First, a fuzzy TOPSIS method with fuzzy entropy weight measure is 
developed for the fuzzy multi-response quality problem. Second, Taguchi method is combined with the developed 
fuzzy TOPSIS method to select satisfactory combinations of parameters for wafer fabrication process. Finally, the 
developed approach is implemented to show the benefit of improving the quality problem in wafer fabrication process. 
2. DEVELOPMENT OF FUZZY TOPSIS METHOD 
The method of Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was proposed by [19] 
in which the concept of compromise solution [20] is adopted and served as proximity to the ideal solution. The TOPSIS 
method selects the best alternatives based on criteria in which the distance to the positive ideal solution is shortest and 
the distance to the negative ideal solution is longest. The positive ideal solution is the one with the maximal benefit 
value and minimal cost value among all possible alternatives. The negative ideal solution is the one with minimal 
benefit value and maximal cost values. The positive and negative ideal solutions can be found by way of weighting the 
normalized decision matrix. A relative closeness is computed and used for ranking all possible alternatives by the 
measure of Euclidean distance. 
The fuzzy TOPSIS method is one of fuzzy MADA methods in which the fuzzy sets theory is used to modify the 
TOPSIS method for decision problems under fuzzy environments. Fuzzy set theory is applied to provide fuzzy number 
for describing any fuzzy subset of responses and preferences with suitable membership functions. Then, the developed 
fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to rank all possible alternatives by the criteria of relative closeness to positive and 
negative ideal solutions. The following is the detailed procedure for the developed fuzzy TOPSIS method. 
2.1. CONSTRUCTING A FUZZY MULTI-CRITERION DECISION MATRIX 
Construction of fuzzy decision matrix is the first step for solving fuzzy multi-attribute decision problem. Every 
alternative is evaluated under each criterion to obtain its performance measure. Suppose there are k decision makers, m 
alternatives, and n criteria. Each decision maker k can provide one fuzzy performance measure, ij
k = ( ), 
under the jth criterion for the ith alternative, where  is smallest number,  medium number and  largest number, 
that is, . The k fuzzy performance measures are summed and denoted as ij via equation (1). Then the 
fuzzy decision matrix ( ) can be constructed as shown in equation (2). 
ij = ij
1+ ij
2+…+ ij
k                                                                                                                    (1) 
 = mxn           i=1,2,…,m；j=1,2,…,n                                                                                 (2) 
2.2. NORMALIZING THE FUZZY DECISION MATRIX 
In order to be comparable among each criterion, the collected data under different criteria should be normalized 
into the scale of between 0 and 1. At least two ways of normalization can be used in this purpose, that is, vector 
normalization and linear normalization ([21], [22], [23]). The linear normalization is used in this study due to its 
simplicity. The normalized fuzzy decision matrix  can be obtained via equations (3) and (4), where ij is the 
normalized fuzzy number. 
 = [ ij]m×n, i=1,2,…,m；j=1,2,…,n                                                                                              (3)

2.6. Calculating the distances to fuzzy positive and negative ideal solutions 
Let i
+ be the distance to the fuzzy positive ideal solution from alternative i and i
- be the distance to the fuzzy 
negative ideal solution from alternative i. Then equations (16) and (17) can be used to calculate for i

2.7. COMPUTING THE FUZZY RELATIVE CLOSENESS FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE 
Let i be the fuzzy relative closeness coefficient for alternative i. Equation (18) can be used to compute the fuzzy 
relative closeness coefficient. The fuzzy relative closeness for alternative i represents the degree of proximity to the 
positive ideal solution. If the computed i value is close to 1, one can infer that alternative i approaches the positive 
ideal solution and could be the best one among other alternatives. Otherwise, if i value is far less than 1, alternative i 
won’t be a good one.

2.8. RANKING THE ALTERNATIVES BY THE FUZZY CLOSENESS COEFFICIENT 
The obtained fuzzy closeness coefficients are averaged and used to rank all possible alternatives. The larger the 
mode of i is, the better the alternative i will be. 
3. CASE STUDY 
In this study, one of wafer fabrication processes, the deposition process, is used as a case study for showing the 
implementation of the developed fuzzy TOPSIS method. During the deposition process, three quality responses place 
significant effects on the quality of wafers, that is, defect number on wafer surface, density of wafer, and deposition 
rate. The defect number is type of the smaller-the-better response, the density the larger-the-better response, and the 
deposition rate the nominal-the-better response. 
During the experiment, six control factors are selected, that is, deposition temperature, deposition pressure, 
nitrogen flow, silane flow, setup time, and cleaning method. Each control factor has three levels. By Taguchi 
experimental design method, the L18(2
1×37) orthogonal table is used to provide eighteen combinations for this 
experiment, shown  in Table 1. 
For each combination of experiment, three wafers were randomly selected from one batch of 50 wafers and 
inspected in terms of defect number, density, and deposition rate on three positions of each wafer, that is, top, central, 
and bottom. Experimental data were collected and summarized to provide a fuzzy decision matrix. The obtained fuzzy 
decision matrix is normalized. The fuzzy entropy method is then applied to estimate fuzzy weights for each quality 
response, provided in Table 2. Using the fuzzy weights, the weighted fuzzy decision matrix is calculated in Table 3.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
The quality problems arising in the IC semi-conductor components are diverse, variable, and fuzzy. The design of 
wafer fabrication process should consider many aspects of the quality problem and takes so much time and cost to solve 
the quality problem. A fuzzy TOPSIS method with fuzzy entropy weight measure is developed for the fuzzy 
multi-response quality problem. Since during the deposition process in wafer fabrication, some undesired defect 
number on the wafer surface might occur quite often and the variability of the density within wafers and in-between 
wafers might be large, it is essential to investigate those cause and effect to improve the quality problem. In this study, 
the deposition process in the wafer fabrication is used a case study to demonstrate the merit of the developed fuzzy 
TOPSIS method. Results of this study indicate that the developed approach provide a satisfactory combination of 
control factors for the wafer fabrication process.  
There are several opportunities that can apply the developed fuzzy TOPSIS approach for future study. One can find 
that the demand for electronic product with higher quality is increasing and the environment under the various quality 
measurements is becoming uncertain and fuzzy. The developed fuzzy TOPSIS method can be considered to apply in
