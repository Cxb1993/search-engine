Chapter 1 Introduction 
1.1 Motivation and Background 
Over the past decade, due to the advances in nanotechnology and software 
technology have resulted in an explosive growth of thermal management problems in 
compact space. The thermal requirements on the personal computer (PC) become 
much stricter with the increase in the dissipation of CPU and VGA. One of the 
solutions is the use of heat pipes. Nowadays, we commonly find heat pipes in 
notebook computers, game consoles, and even integrated into normal PC CPU coolers. 
A heat pipe is a heat transfer device that utilizes vaporization and condensation of the 
working fluid to efficiently transfer heat from the evaporator section to the condenser 
section. Typically designed to carry less than 40 W of power, these parts are low in 
cost and highly reliable. Heat pipe use in high-power (>150 W) cooling applications 
has been limited to custom applications requiring either low thermal resistance or with 
a severely restricted enclosure area. The cost of these larger diameter heat pipes is 
high due to a limited number of manufacturers and handmade assembly. 
However, traditional working fluids have poor heat transfer properties compared 
to most solids, therefore, Argonne National Laboratory has developed a new class of 
heat transfer fluids called “Nano-fluids”, which are engineered by suspending 
ultra-fine metallic or nonmetallic nanometer dimension particles in traditional fluids 
such as water, engine oil, ethylene glycol, etc(Choi, 1995). Some experimental 
investigations have demonstrated that nano-fluids advantages; such as high thermal 
conductivity, high convective heat transfer, high critical heat flux and high surface 
wettability. Therefore, the main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the silver 
nano-fluids heat pipe thermal performance.

Thus, for effective capillary pumping fluid through the wick structure, the selection a 
well-wetting fluid must be considered. 
The thermal performance of heat pipes was estimated as shown in Fig. 2 [2, 3]. The 
overall thermal resistance ( HPR ) is comprised of ten different resistances arranged in a 
series-parallel combination. Numbers of investigations have indicated that the main 
resistance consisted of the pipe wall radial resistances ( 10R ), the liquid-wick 
resistances at both the evaporator ( 3R ) and condenser ( 7R ), radial resistance of the 
pipe wall at evaporator ( 2R ) and condenser ( 8R ). The expression for the equivalent 
thermal resistance of 2R , 3R , 7R , 8R and 10R are

liquid flow thickness becomes smaller and the liquid film thinner, and leads to a 
decrease in the thermal resistance of the macro liquid region. The thermal resistance 
will reach its minimum as the liquid flow thickness is equal to non-evaporating film 
thickness [4]. Ma et al. studied the effect of capillary flow on the condensation heat 
transfer occurring on the vertical grooved plate. Numerical results indicated that the 
capillary flow induced by the capillary force significantly affects the condensation 
heat transfer in addition to the plate height, groove width, and groove angle. When 
porous drainage strips are used at the edge of the drainage plane, the length of the 
grooved condensing plate has a larger influence on the condensation heat transfer 
coefficient of a grooved plate. When grooves on the condensing plate are optimized, 
the drainage strip can significantly enhance the condensation heat transfer occurring 
on the grooved plate [5]. In addition, they also investigated the effect of contact angle 
on the meniscus radius, thin film profile and heat flux distribution occurring in the 
micro-trapezoidal grooves of a heat pipe. The numerical results show that while the 
capillary limitation governs the maximum heat transport capability in a grooved heat 
pipe, the thin film evaporation determines the effective thermal conductivity in a 
grooved heat pipe. The ratio of the heat transfer through the thin film region to the 
total heat transfer through the wall to the vapor phase decreases when the contact 
angle increases. The superheat effects on the heat flux distribution in the thin film 
region also have been conducted and the results show that the disjoining pressure 
plays an important role in this region [6]. 
The recent development of screen mesh wick, the effect of wick thickness and 
fluid loading on the heat transfer performance of wicked heat pipes was 
experimentally investigated by testing heat pipes with 1 to 6 layers of wire screen 
mesh as a wick. The results showed that the heat pipes with the smaller number of 
mesh layers, the effective thermal resistance was non-linear, especially at low heat

1.2.2 Review of Nano-fluids 
1.2.2.1 Basic Concepts 
Nano-fluids are solid-liquid composite materials consisting of solid nanoparticles 
with sizes typically of 1-100 nm suspended in liquid [16]. Owing to the nanoparticles 
have three attractive features: a large surface area, less particle momentum, and high 
mobility, thereby made it probable candidates for suspension in fluids. Das et al. 
proposed five possible benefits of nano-fluids that are expected as following: 1. 
Higher heat conduction, 2. Stability, 3. Microchannel cooling without clogging, 4. 
Reduced chances of erosion, 5. Reduction in pumping power [17].  
Because the basis for operation of a heat pipe is the vaporization, condensation 
and capillarity of the working fluid, selection of a suitable working fluid is the 
important concept in heat pipe technology. Hence, four advantages of nano-fluids in 
cooling technology are proposed in the present study. 
 
1.2.2.2 Effective Thermal Conductivity 
The heat pipe typically consists of a sealed container, wick structure and working 
fluid. For given a specific tube, the liquid-wick structure thermal resistance is 
dependent on the thermal conductivity of the working fluid. In order to decrease this 
thermal resistance, a working fluid with high thermal conductivity is needed for 
enhancing the performance. Numerous studies on the thermal conductivity of 
nanoparticles dispersed in fluids have been investigated. Early experimental studies 
focus on Cu, CuO and Al2O3 nanoparticles suspensions in base fluids, such as 
deionized water (DW) and ethylene glycol (EG) . Their results have demonstrated that 
nanoparicles dispersed in base fluid can enhance the effective thermal conductivity 
(keff) of fluid. Lee et al. indicated the keff ratio increases of EG systems are always 
higher than water based nano-fluid systems [18].  
9 
In 2003, Xie et al. propose a method to produce stable and homogeneous 
suspensions of CNTs in DW, EG, and DE and showed enhanced thermal 
conductivities of these nano-fluids. The thermal conductivity enhancement increases 
with the increase in nanotube loading, but is reduced with thermal conductivity 
increase of the base fluid [26]. Das et al. go detailed into investigating the increase of 
thermal conductivity with temperature for nano-fluids with water as base fluid and 
particles of Al2O3 or CuO as suspension material.It is observed that a 2 to 4 fold 
increase in thermal conductivity enhancement of nano-fluids can take place over a 
temperature range of 21°C to 51°C. This finding makes nano-fluids even more 
attractive as cooling fluid for devices with high energy density [27]. The thermal 
conductivity of Au and Ag nano-fluid were measured. The results showed that: 
thermal conductivity enhancement of 5%–21% in the temperature range of 30–60 °C 
at a loading of 0.00026% V.F. Au-citrate nano-fluid. When loading the 0.011% V. F. 
Au-thiolate nano-fluid, the thermal conductivity increased in 7%–14%. Thermal 
conductivity if Ag-citrate nano-fluid was enhanced 3.2%–16.5% at 0.001% V. F. 
loading [28].  
In 2005, the systematic experiments for thermal conductivity measurements 
using three different batches of fairly monodipersed Al2O3 samples. The most 
important finding is the effect of the nanoparticle mobility, known as the Brownian 
velocity that is single most dominant function of temperature for a given particle size. 
The result indicated that the nano-fluid thermal conductivity increases primarily as a 
result of increasing nanoparticle Brownian motion [29]. TiO2 nanoparticles in 
rod-shapes of 10 nm×40 nm (diameter by length) and in spherical shapes of 15 nm 
were dispersed in DW by Murshed’s group. The experimental results show that the 
thermal conductivity increases with an increase of particle volume fraction and 
particle size. For 5% volumetric loading of rod-shape, the enhancement is found to be 
11 
nanoparticles and temperature are clarified. The results show that the effective 
thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increase with an increase in the particle 
concentration, in the particle thermal conductivity, and in the ratio of the length to 
diameter of CNFs [37]. Liu et al. conducts a chemical reduction method to produce 
Cu–water nano-fluids. The chemically synthesized copper nanoparticles in water 
without surfactant significantly improve thermal conductivities, compared to pure 
fluids. For example, the thermal conductivity of Cu/water suspension can be enhanced 
by 23.8 percent at a volume fraction of 0.001 [38]. And then they measured the 
thermal conductivity of Cu-EG nano-fluid, the results showed that thermal 
conductivity was enhanced by up to 22.4 % at a volume fraction of 0.05 [39]. Li and 
Peterson investigated the effects of variations in the temperature and volume fraction 
on the steady-state effective thermal conductivity of CuO (29nm) nano-fluid and 
Al2O3 (36nm) nano-fluid, respectively. The 6% volume fraction of CuO nano-fluid 
and Al2O3 nano-fluid resulted in an increase in the effective thermal conductivity of 
1.52 times and 1.3 times comparison with pure water [40]. Zhang et al. measured the 
effective thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of Al2O3/water, ZrO2/water, 
TiO2/water, and CuO/water nano-fluids and analyzed the effect of the volume 
fractions and thermal conductivities of nanoparticles and temperature. The results 
show that the effective thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increase with an 
increase in the particle concentration and in the thermal conductivity of nanoparticles 
[41]. Hwang et al. measured the thermal conductivities of the MWCNTs/water, 
CuO/water, SiO2 /water, and CuO/EG nano-fluids. Based on the particle volume 
fraction of 1%, the MWCNTs/water reached the maximum enhancement ratio thermal 
conductivity than others. And results indicated that the thermal conductivity of 
nanofluids depends on the thermal conductivity of the suspended particles and base 
fluids [42, 44]. Yang and Han found that the thermal conductivity enhancement in the 
13 
thermal conductivity is attributed to the effective conduction of heat through the 
chainlike structures formed in the nano-fluid [49]. A novel synthesis method was 
proposed to make a well-dispersed CuO nano-fluid. It was synthesized by 
transforming an unstable Cu(OH)2 precursor to CuO in water under an ultrasonic 
vibration, followed by microwave irradiation. The thermal conductivity enhancements 
of CuO nano-fluid are 18%, 28%, and 31%, correlated to volume fractions of 1%, 3%, 
and 5%. The experimental data show a nonlinear correlation between the thermal 
conductivity and the volume fraction of CuO nanoparticles [50]. Hwang et al. 
investigated the stability and thermal conductivity of nano-fluids. The result indicated 
that the stability of nano-fluid is strongly affected by the characteristics of the 
suspended particle and base fluids such as the particle morphology, the chemical 
structure of the particles and base fluid [51]. Yoo et al. studied on the thermal 
conductivities of TiO2, Al2O3, Fe, and WO3 nano-fluids and compared with each other. 
The major finding showed that the surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles is a 
principle factor in determining thermal conductivity of nano-fluids [52]. Li and 
Peterson studied the effect of particle size on the effective thermal conductivity of 
Al2O3-water nano-fluid. The thermal conductivity enhancement of the two nano-fluids 
demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with respect to temperature, volume fraction, 
and nanoparticle size, with increases in the volume fraction, temperature, and particle 
size all resulting in an increase in the measured enhancement. The most significant 
finding was the effect that variations in particle size had on the effective thermal 
conductivity of the nano-fluid [53]. In 2008, CuO nano-fluid of average diameter 8 
nm were synthesized by a simple precipitation technique. The maximum enhancement 
of thermal conductivity observed with 1 vol.% of CuO nanoparticles is 54%. The 
large enhancement in thermal conductivity is attributed to the smaller particle size and 
monodispersity of particles. The thermal conductivity of nano-fluid increases

1.2.2.3 Convective Heat Transfer 
With increasing power density in a compact space, liquid cooling is one method 
in thermal management. The main mechanism for liquid cooling is convective heat 
transfer. Nano-fluids not only have higher thermal conductivity but also have a higher 
convective heat transfer coefficient. In 2003, Xuan and Li investigate convective heat 
transfer and flow features of the nano-fluid in a tube. The measured value showed that 
nano-fluid has larger heat transfer coefficient than that of the original base liquid 
under the same Reynolds number. The friction factor for the dilute nano-fluids 
consisting of water and Cu-nanoparticles is approximately the same as that of water 
[57]. Wen and Ding studied on the convective heat transfer of nano-fluids, made of 
γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles and DW, flowing through a copper tube in the laminar flow 
regime. The major finding is that the enhancement of convective heat transfer is 
particularly significant in the entrance region, and decreases with axial distance. And 
17 
through a horizontal tube. They observed the enhancement is a function of axial 
distance from the inlet, increasing first, reaching a maximum, and then decreasing 
with increasing axial distance. They proposed the possible mechanism of convective 
heat transfer coefficient enhancement is the reduction of boundary layer thickness 
[63]. And then they also investigated the natural convective heat transfer of TiO2 
nano-fluid. The results show that the presence of nanoparticles systematically 
decreases the natural convective heat transfer coefficient, an observation that contrasts 
our previous expectation. The maximum decrease is observed to be around 30% [64]. 
Laminar flow forced convection heat transfer of Al2O3/water nano-fluid inside a 
circular tube with constant wall temperature was investigated experimentally by Heris 
et al. The experimental results indicate that heat transfer coefficient of nano-fluids 
increases with Peclet number as well as nanoparticles concentration [65]. He et al. 
carried out on the flow and heat transfer behaviour of aqueous TiO2 nano-fluids 
flowing through a straight vertical pipe under both the laminar and turbulent flow 
conditions. The result showed that addition of nanoparticles into the base liquid 
enhances the thermal conduction and the enhancement increases with increasing 
particle concentration and decreasing particle (agglomerate) size [66]. 
Previous works have demonstrated that nanoparticles dispersed in fluid 
significantly enhanced the convective heat transfer and with the similar friction factor 
of water, as shown in Table 2.  
Therefore, Nguyen et al. have applied these advantages in a liquid cooling 
system [67]. They utilized the Al2O3 nanoparticles-water as the coolant; the results 
showed the maximum enhancement was 40% at particle volume concentration of 
6.8%. In addition, experiments showed an increase of nano-fluid concentration 
produced a clear decrease of heated block temperature. According to previous studies, 
the nano-fluids have greater convective heat transfer characteristics than water, and 
19 
showed that the CHF performance has been enhanced to ~32% and ~13%, 
respectively, for both horizontal flat surface and vertical flat surface in the pool due to 
delayed boiling activity [73]. Wen and Ding studied the pool boiling heat transfer of 
γ-Al2O3/water nano-fluids. The results show that nano-fluids can significantly 
enhance boiling heat transfer and the enhancement increases with increasing particle 
concentration and reaches~40% at a particle loading of 1.25wt% [74]. Junhong et al. 
investigated the effect of mass concentration of magnetic particles and an applied 
magnetic field on pool boiling heat transfer of water-based magnetic fluid on a 
horizontal heater. The experimental results show that high-concentration magnetic 
fluid deteriorates boiling heat transfer, while middle- and low-concentration magnetic 
fluid enhances the boiling heat transfer. When the concentration was reduced, the 
enhancement effect of the applied magnetic field became more remarkable [75]. 
Milanova and Kumar systematically studied the effect of the negatively charged silica 
nanoparticle suspension in boiling conditions in water for different particle size, 
particle concentration, and under various pH conditions and ionic concentration. The 
experimental data showed that nanosilica suspension increases the critical heat flux 3 
times compared to conventional fluids [76]. Kim et al. investigate the characteristics 
of CHF enhancement using nano-fluids, the results showed that the nano-fluids 
significantly enhanced CHF compared to that of pure water [77].  
The Korea researcher found that a lot of nanoparticles were deposited on heating 
surface and formed a porous layer. This layer significantly improves the surface 
wettability, as shown by a reduction of the static contact angle on the nanofluid-boiled 
surfaces compared with the pure-water-boiled surfaces. The contact angle reduction is 
attributed to changes in surface energy and surface morphology brought about by the 
presence of the nanoparticle layer. The high surface wettability can plausibly explain 
the boiling critical heat flux enhancement in nano-fluids [78]. And then they 
21 
proved by many researchers, as shown in Table 3. Many investigators proposed a 
porous layer formed by nanoparticles significantly improves the surface wettability 
and is the main factor for enhancing the CHF [77-81]. With the previous 
investigations, the CHF can be enhanced by a small amount of nanoparticles 
dispersed in pure water due to the enhanced surface wettability. That means it is 
helpful in cooling high heat flux components and without a complex manufacturing 
process. 
 
1.3 Nano-fluid Application in Heat Pipes 
1.3.1 Heat Pipes 
Since the nano-fluids are with the unique thermal properties for heat transfer 
application. In 2004, Tsai et al. investigated the thermal performance of gold 
nano-fluids (8~43.7 nm) in meshed heat pipes. The circular meshed heat pipe had a 
length 170 mm and an outer diameter of 6 mm. The heat pipe thermal resistance 
ranged from 0.17 to 0.215 °C/W. The measured results show that the thermal 
resistance of the heat pipes with nano-fluids was lower than pipes containing pure 
water [85]. A miniature flat heat pipe (MFHP), with micro-grooved heat transfer 
surface of its evaporator, was filled with Water-CuO as working fluid to investigate 
the boiling heat transfer characteristics. The experimental results indicated the heat 
transfer coefficient and the CHF can increase 25%~150% and 50%~200% under 
various pressures, respectively [86].  
Water-based CuO (50nm) nano-fluid was filled into a horizontal micro-grooves 
heat pipe to study its heat transfer performances in the evaporating and condensing 
sections under steady operating pressures (7.45, 12.38 and 19.97 kPa). The mass 
concentration of CuO nanoparticles ranged from 0.5 wt% to 2.0 wt%. The results 
showed the average temperatures and temperature difference of the heat pipe for 
23 
 
Fig. 6 Effect of the mass concentration of nanoparticles on the heat resistance [87] 
 
1.3.2 Thermosyphon 
A two-phase closed thermosyphon is a gravity-assisted wickless heat pipe. The 
property of the working fluid is the important factor for thermal performance. 
Nano-fluids with unique thermal properties compared with water are therefore utilized 
as the working medium in the thermosyphon. In 2006, acid-treated carbon nanotubes 
nano-fluid was filled in a two-phase closed thermosyphon to investigate its 
performance. The carbon nanotube (d=15nm, L=10μm) filled thermosyphon has a 
high evaporation section wall temperature, incipience temperature, and thermal 
resistance. At 555 W, the thermal resistance of the suspension-filled thermosyphon 
was about 3.3 times that of the water-filled thermosyphon. That means the addition of 
carbon nanotubes deteriorated the performance of the thermosyphon [88].

Shang et al. investigated two topics on the self-exciting mode and flow 
characteristics of OHP performance [94, 95]. The copper nanoparticle size range is 
from 25nm to 60nm. The self-exciting mode OHP with nano-fluid enhanced the 
thermal performance and proposed that the optimal filling ratio of nano-fluid should 
be more than water. Additionally, the experiment indicated that the multiphase flow of 
steam, fluid and different forms of nanometer particles in the OHP strongly affected 
the heat transfer, and under specific conditions, heat transfer could be enhanced. Kang 
et al. investigated the effect of silver nano-fluid on pulsating heat pipe thermal 
performance. The experiment shows the best filled ratio is 60%, and the better filled 
fluid is 100 ppm of silver nano-fluid. When the filled ratio is 60% and the heating 
power is 85 W, the average temperature difference of evaporator and condenser 
compared with the pure water is less than 7.79 ℃, and the thermal resistance is also 
less than 0.092 ℃/W [96]. 
From the aforementioned discussion, which is summarized in Table 4 and shown

Chapter 2 Heat Pipe Thermal Performance 
This chapter introduces the experimental setup and test procedure for thermal 
performance analysis of the heat pipes. Grooved heat pipe and sintered heat pipe of 
varying dimensions were tested in the present study. 
 
2.1 Experimental Setup and Procedure 
2.1.1 Experimental Setup 
The nanoparticles used in these experiments were silver particles 10 nm and 
35nm in size. The base working fluid was pure-water. Silver (Ag) nano-fluids were 
prepared using a two-step method. Ag nanoparticles were prepared first. Ag 
nanoparticles were produced using a catalytic chemical vapor deposition method 
(NANOHUBS TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.). The silver nanoparticles were then 
added to pure water. No surfactant was used in the Ag-nano-fluid suspensions. The 
mixture was created using an ultrasonic homogenizer. Nano-fluid concentrations of 1 
mg/l, 10 mg/l, 50mg/l and 100 mg/l (ppm) were used in this study. Fig. 13 shows a 
TEM image of the Ag nanoparticles.

2.2.1 Grooved Heat Pipe 
An experimental system was set up to measure the thermal resistance of circular 
grooved heat pipes. The outer diameter and length of the heat pipes used in these 
experiments were 6 mm and 200 mm, respectively. The heat pipe contained 211µm 
width × 217µm depth grooves. 
2.2.1.1 Effect of Nanoparticle Concentration 
Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 show the wall temperature distribution according to 200 mm 
heat pipe axial length with a diameter of 6 mm under the water-cooling. As Fig. 15(a) 
shows, the wall temperature distributions of the heat pipe containing pure water were 
41.06 °C, 40.96 °C, 40.92 °C, 40.89 °C, and 40.81 °C, respectively. After adding a 
small amount of silver nanoparticles in the pure water, the heat pipe wall temperature 
became lower than that for pipes filled with pure water; from 40.56 °C to 40.37 °C (1 
ppm). As more the nano-partilces became dispersed in the working fluid, the heat pipe 
wall temperature increase became smaller than that for pure water filled heat pipe 
under various heat loads.  
However, a continuing decreasing in heat pipe wall temperature was not 
observed at concentrations higher than 50 ppm. Therefore, the 50 ppm nano-fluid is 
the lowest heat pipe increase in wall temperature.

2.2.1.3 Preliminary Summary 
The primary conclusions of the nano-fluid filled in grooved heat pipe are listed 
below. 
(1) With greater silver nanoparticles dispersed in working fluid, the increase in 
heat pipe wall temperature was smaller than that for a pure water filled heat 
pipe under various heat loads. 
(2) Comparing two nanoparticle sizes with the thermal resistance using DI-water, 
the maximum reduction was 50% (10 nm) and 80% (35nm), respectively. 
Therefore, the thermal resistance of grooved heat pipe depended on the size 
of the nanoparticles. 
2.2.2 Sintered Heat Pipe 
An experimental system was set up to measure the thermal resistance of circular 
heat pipes. The outer diameter and length of the heat pipes used in these experiments 
were 6 mm and 200 mm, respectively. The heat pipe contained 1mm wick-thickness 
copper powder (150~180 mμ ) sintered wicked. 
2.2.2.1 Effect of Nanoparticle Concentration 
Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 show the wall temperature distribution according to 200 mm 
heat pipe axial length with a diameter of 6 mm under the water-cooling. As Fig. 20(a) 
shows, the wall temperature difference of the heat pipe containing pure water were 
0.89 °C, 0.9 °C and 1.19 °C, respectively (30W~50W). After adding a small amount 
of silver nanoparticles in the pure water, the temperature difference became lower 
than that for pipes filled with pure water. At an input power of 60 W, the temperature 
difference of pure water filled heat pipe exceeds 10 , but the nano℃ -fluid filled heat

Chapter 3 Surface Wettability 
In heat pipe design, a high wettability fluid is desirable in order to enable to the 
heat pipe to operate against gravity to generate a high capillary driving force. To 
investigate the effect of nanoparticle on capillary phenomena, the static contact angle 
of nano-fluid was measured in present study.  
In addition, S. Vafaei et al. used bismuth telluride nanoparticles with an average 
range from 2.5 to 10.4 nm. The results show that smaller sized nanoparticles lead to 
larger changes in the contact angle at the same mass concentration [97]. In addition, 
Xue et al. investigated the performance of a nano-tube aqueous solution used to fill a 
two-phase closed thermosyphon [98]. They measured the contact angle of water 
(109.5°) and nano-fluid (103.2°) on a copper sheet. Chon et al. studied the thermal 
characteristics of evaporating nano-fluid droplets. Their experiments showed a 
ring-shaped nanoparticle stain was formed, and particle size had strong effect on the 
dried stain [99]. Previous studies have not shown the effect of the nanoparticle 
distribution on surface wetttability. 
The purpose of this chapter was therefore to investigate the characteristics of a 
silver nanoparticle distribution, concentration and size on surface wettability. The 
contact angle is measured to determine the relationship between these factors. 
 
3.1 Experimental Setup and Procedure 
The nanoparticles used in these experiments were Ag particles 10 nm and 35 nm 
in size. The base working fluid was pure-water. Ag nano-fluids were prepared using a 
two-step method. Concentrations of 1 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 10 mg/l, 15 mg/l, 50mg/l and 100 
mg/l (ppm) were used in this study. In the experiment, the area and thickness of the 
copper plates were 40×40 mm and 1.5mm, respectively.  
49 
contact angle compared with 10nm nano-particles and pure water. 
 
 
Concentration (ppm) 
Fig. 22. Effect of silver nanoparticle concentration on contact angle 
 
Since the contact angle has a nonlinear relationship with the nanoparticle size 
and concentration, an optical microscope and FE-SEM were utilized to investigate the 
nanoparticle distribution effect on the contact angle for the first time. Fig. 23 and 
Fig.24 show the OM images (Zoom=50X) of evaporated droplets on specimens. With 
increasing nanoparticle concentration, the droplet rim becomes clearer. In particular, 
there is more sediment in the central droplet region at 50ppm and 100 ppm. To 
analyze the specimen rim and sediment compositions, Fig. 25 and Table 5 show the 
FE-SEM and EDS analysis results. As Fig. 25(a) and Fig. 25(b) show, there are lots of 
nanoparticles over the droplet rim and formed a porous nano-particle layer. That 
means most of nanoparticles distribution were clustered over the rim. As shown in 
table 5, there are 17.62 Wt% (1ppm) and 15.28 Wt% (1ppm) of Ag nanoparticles over 
the outside (over the rim). But the porous layer over the outside rim is not observed in 
51

3.3 Preliminary Summary 
The following summary is drawn from the experimental results presented in this 
chapter: 
(1) The surface wettability is enhanced by silver nanoparticles dispersed in base fluid. 
The maximum contact angle reduction is close to 20°. A continuous decrease in 
contact angle was not observed at concentrations higher than 15 ppm under 
various particle sizes.  
(2) Comparing the effect of two nanoparticle sizes at the same concentration, the 
35nm nanoparticles produced lower contact angle. 
(3) The nanoparticles formed a nano-porous layer over the droplet rim at low 
concentrations. Increasing concentration caused the second rim to exhibit porous 
layer deposition. The possible reason might be the gravity affect on the 
nanoparticle distribution, causing a higher concentration with more sediment. 
According to the experimental results, nano-fluids may be advantageous in capillary 
and phase change phenomena applications. This research provides a simple method to 
enhance the surface wettability and capillary force.

Nano-fluids have a powerful advantage in dealing with the increasing heat flux. 
In 2003, You’s group showed that Al2O3 nanoparticles suspended in fluid significantly 
increasied the critical heat flux (CHF) in comparison with water. MIT’s group 
proposed a porous layer formed by nanoparticles significantly improves surface 
wettability and is the main factor for enhancing the CHF [77-81, 84]. Since the 
equivalent thickness of liquid film ( eδ ) increases with decreasing contact angle (Fig. 
28) as eqns. (4.4)

Since the film thickness of water in condenser section [ ( )w condδ ] is thicker than 
nano-fluids [ ( )nf condδ ] and thereby the heat dissipation of water is less than 
nano-fluids. 
 
4.3 Convective Heat Transfer 
The single phase cooling is one method in thermal management and its major 
mechanism is convective heat transfer. Previous works have demonstrated the 
nano-fluids have a higher convective heat transfer coefficient and have a similar 
65 
nano-fluid shown a smaller temperature difference between the evaporator section and 
the condenser section, and was therefore enhanced the OHP thermal performance 
[91-95]. 
 
4.4 Preliminary Summary 
In this chapter, we have taken the first step to propose the possible mechanisms 
(effective thermal conductivity, surface wettability and convective heat transfer) in 
nano-fluids application in heat pipe technology. The major findings contained in this 
paper are: 
(a) The theoretical results of nano-fluids showed that the higher effective 
thermal conductivity can not be a well agreement with experimental 
results of heat pipe thermal performance. Hence, the highly effective 
thermal conductivity of nano-fluids is not the main mechanisms for 
enhancing the heat pipe thermal performance. 
(b) When the nano-fluid boiled, the nanoparticles are deposited on the 
surface and form a porous layer. The porous layer not only increases the 
surface wettability but also improves the capillary force, critical heat 
flux and condensation phenomena. For these concepts, an increasing 
surface wettability may be the major enhanced mechanism of thermal 
performance. 
(c) The suspended nanoparticles in base fluid showed a significantly 
increased convective heat transfer performance. This advantage is 
suitable to application in single-phase cooling systems and 
mixture-phase cooling systems (OHP). 
These findings give nano-fluids a highly competitive advantage in 
67 
Chapter 5 Summary and Conclusions     
5.1 Summary 
An overview of nano-fluids application in heat pipes technology (heat pipe, 
thermosyphon and oscillating heat pipe etc.) was presented in Chapter 1. Based on 
existing literature, four advantages are proposed for application such as high thermal 
conductivity, high convective heat transfer coefficient, high critical heat flux and high 
surface wettability.  
The 211µm width × 217µm depth grooved circular heat pipe and 1mm 
wick-thickness sintered circular heat pipe filling with silver nano-fluids were tested to 
analyze the effect of nano-fluids (Chapter 2). In order to investigate the characteristics 
of a silver nanoparticle distribution, concentration and size on surface wettability. The 
contact angle is measured to determine the relationship between these factors 
(Chapter 3). The fundamental mechanisms of enhanced heat transfer for heat pipes 
were investigated and three possible explanations for this increase: Effective thermal 
conductivity, surface wettability and convective heat transfer are discussed in Chapter 
4. 
 
5.2 Conclusions 
The silver nano-fluids filled in the grooved heat pipe and sintered heat pipe were 
experimentally tested. Some of the conclusions arrived from the current study were: 
(a) At a same charge volume, the measured nano-fluid filled heat pipe temperature 
distribution demonstrated that the thermal resistance decreased 10%~80% 
compared to DI-water at an input power of 30~60W. The measured results also 
show that the thermal resistances of the heat pipe decrease as the silver 
nanoparticle size and concentration increase.

Appendix III Experimental uncertainty analysis 
    Using the method by Holman [1989], suppose a set of measurement is made the 
uncertainty in each measurement may be expressed with the same odds. These 
measurements are then used to calculate some desired result of the experiments. The 
result R is a given function of the independent variables x1, x2, x3, ..., xn. Thus 
1 2 3( , , ,... )R R x x x xn=  
Let wR be the uncertainty in the result, and w(x1), w(x2), w(x3),..., w(xn) be the 
uncertainties in the independent variables. If the uncertainties in the independent 
variables are all given with same odds, then in the result having these odds is given by 
Kline and McClintock [1953] as

According to this formula, the experimental uncertainty in present study can be 
calculated as following: 
(1) Uncertainty of temperature 
The tube wall temperature measured by the T-type thermocouple has typically 
±0.1  precision. According to working temperature (40 to 100 ), the related ℃ ℃ ℃
uncertainty is about 0.33%. 
(2) Uncertainty of power supply 
The input power was supplied by CT605D power supply has ±0.5% precision 
and then the related uncertainty is about 1.41%。 
(3) Uncertainty of manufacturing  
The jig was manufactured by CNC has 0.5mm precision and then the related 
uncertainty is about 5.2%。 
(4) Uncertainty of thermal bath 
The thermal bath provides the constant-temperature water to cooling the heat

Abstract 
This study utilizes a silver nano-fluid on a flat heat pipe.  
It studies the effect of various concentrations on flat heat pipe 
thermal performance by air-cooling testing equipment.  The 
particles used in these experiments were silver particles 35 
nm in size.  The base working fluid was pure-water.  Nano-
fluids were prepared using a two-step method.  In the 
experiment, the thickness and length of the heat pipe are 3 
mm and 200 cm, respectively.  An experimental system was 
set up to measure the temperature distribution of heat pipes 
and calculate the thermal resistance by equation R = ∆T /Q. 
At the same charge volume, the thermal resistance of the heat 
pipe filled with nano-fluid was lower than that of DI water.

1. Introduction 
Now that “Tera-scale computing” is coming [1], more 
heat generation will accompany compact electronic 
components.  The requisite thermal management for a 
personal computer is most often achieved via heat pipe (HP), 
heat sink and fans.  In general, flat heat pipes (FHP) are 
usually used as notebook coolers, due to their favorable 
thermal characteristics and flexiblility.  In 2000, Wang and 
Vafai [2-3] investigated the thermal performance of the FHP; 
their results showed (1) the wick in the evaporator section 
provides the largest resistance to the heat transfer process, (2) 
the heat transfer coefficient strongly affects the time it takes 
to reach steady state, (3) the experimental results were 
compared with analytical results and were found to be in very 
good agreement.  Peterson and Wang [4] developed a novel 
FHP, which utilized a sintered copper screen mesh as the 
primary wick structure; the experimental results showed the 
maximum heat transport capacity can reach 112 W and 123 
W, respectively.  However, the thermal performance of a 
traditional circular HP is better than for a FHP.  In order to 
enhance the heat transfer efficiency, an innovative heat 
transfer fluid called nano-fluid was developed by Argonne 
National Laboratory [5].  Numbers of experimental 
investigations have demonstrated the nano-fluid has a higher 
effective thermal conductivity and critical heat flux [6-19]. 
This is an advantage in applications such as for heat transfer 
devices. Therefore, the purpose of this present study is to 
investigate the effect of a nano-fluid on FHP thermal 
performance. 
2. Experimental Procedure 
The nano-particles used in these experiments were silver 
particles 35 nm in size. The base working fluid was pure-
water. Silver (Ag) nano-fluids were prepared using a two-step 
method (NANOHUBS TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.). Ag 
nano-particles were prepared first. Ag nano-particles were 
produced using a catalytic chemical vapor deposition method. 
The Ag nano-particles were then added to pure water. No 
surfactant was used in the Ag nano-fluid suspensions. The 
mixture was created using an ultrasonic homogenizer. Nano-
fluid concentrations of 5 mg/l, 50 mg/l and 100 mg/l (ppm) 
were used in this study. An experimental system was set up to 
measure the wall temperature of FHP (Figure 1). The 
thickness and length of the FHP used in these experiments 
were 3 mm and 200 mm, respectively. 
The local temperature on the FHP was measured by four 
isolated type-T thermocouples. Two thermocouples were 
attached to the evaporator; the others were attached to the 
condenser section. All thermocouples were calibrated against 
a quartz thermometer. The uncertainty in temperature 
measurements was 0.1± °C.  Two heater bars (maximum 
120 W) were used as a heat source in the heating section. 
Thus, the heating load ( Q ) and temperature difference 
( evaporator condenserdT T T= - ) were measured, and the thermal 
resistance (R) of FHP was calculated by the

difference of FHP under various input power. 
 
Figure 4: Influence of particle concentration on the thermal 
resistance of FHP under various input power. 
 
 
 
Figure 4 illustrates the influence of thermal resistance on 
FHP containing silver nanofluid and pure water as working 
fluid. The result shows that thermal resistance of FHP filled 
pure water was higher than nano-fluid under 20W to 40W. 
The effect of adding silver nanoparticles on the thermal 
performance of the FHP is more evident if the data are 
expressed as a plot of Rwater-Rnanofluid/Rwater versus nanofluid 
concentration, as shown in Table 1.  This table shows the 
range of reducing rate on thermal resistance were 0.39 to 0.71 
under different concentration.  
4. Conclusions 
This preliminary study investigated the effect of flat heat 
pipe thermal performance using silver-nano-fluid as the 
working fluid.  The temperature difference and the thermal 
resistance of the FHP with the silver nano-particle solution 
was lower than that with pure water. 
The plausible reason for enhancement of the thermal 
performance of the FHP using the nanofluid can be explained 
as follows: 
(1) Using the existing heat pipe and nano-fluid theories, 
particularly those related to the critical heat flux 
enhancement by higher wettability. 
(2) Reducing the boiling limit because of increasing 
effective liquid conductance and the effective thermal 
conductivity of the wick structure in heat pipes.  
Hence, the thermal resistance of a heat pipe is reduced for 
the same reason.
