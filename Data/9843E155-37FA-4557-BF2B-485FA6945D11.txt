deposited nanoparticle atoms on the substrates. The 
well-aligned 0-D to 3-D Bi2Te3 nano- structures show 
more excellent in-plane power factors than most of the 
randomly aligned Bi2Te3 nanostructures at room 
temperature mainly due to significantly reducing inter 
resistance. The thermoelectric properties of these 
well-aligned Bi2Te3 nanostructures are comparable to 
any other intrinsic Bi2Te3 nano- structures that have 
ever been reported. The present data are valuable for 
further improving and designing advanced 
thermoelectric materials and confirm that precise 
control of nanostructural aggregation is an effective 
strategy for enhancing the thermo -electric 
performance.

Introduction 
Nanostructuring has been widely accepted 
as one of the most effective strategies for 
significantly increasing the thermoelectric figure 
of merit ZT=σS2Tκ-1 where σ is the electrical 
conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, T is 
the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal 
conductivity.1-3 The theoretical studies of Bi2Te3 
have obviously predicted the importance of 
controlling size and dimension.4,5 For instance, 
the ZT for a 2-D quantum well (3.8 Å thickness) 
and a 1-D quantum wire (squared cross section 
of 5 Å width) is about 16 and 27 times higher, 
respectively, comparing with that for bulk 
(ZT~0.52). Experimental data for single 
quantum crystal is extremely lacking due to the 
technological difficulties of the thermoelectric 
measurements of such small crystals. Balandin et 
al. experimentally proved that an about 30–40% 
enhancement in ZT for an ultra-thin quasi-2D 
Bi2Te3 crystal was mainly contributed from the 
great drop of the thermal conductivity from 
0.5–0.6 Wm-1K-1 (bulk) to 0.1–0.3 Wm-1K-1 in 
the cross plane direction at room temperature.6 
The presence of boundaries or interfaces 
accompanying with the decreased size or 
dimension is considered to be the key to 
effectively inhibit not only the thermal 
conductivity but usually also the electrical 
conductivity. A remarkable electrical 
conductivity thus is helpful to approach a high 
ZT for quantum crystals because of the 
competition relation between these two 
parameters as described above. It has been 
reported that a single Bi2Te3 nanowire (77 nm 
diameter) can present a high electrical 
conductivity (860 Scm-1)7 which is at same order 
of magnitude compared to that obtained from 
bulk (900 Scm-1)8. In this case, in comparison 
with Bi2Te3 bulk, a higher ZT may be found 
owing to an expected lower thermal 
conductivity. 
Even though individual Bi2Te3 quantum 
crystals have experimentally and theoretically 
demonstrated excellent thermoelectric 
performance, there still exist many technological 
problems in fabrication as well as 
characterization for further applications. 
Assembling of the quantum crystals, i.e. a film 
or bulk with nanostructures, thus becomes a 
much more feasible way for fundamental studies 
and practical applications. It is believed that 
orderly assembling of the nanostructures may be 
an advanced strategy for novel thermoelectric 
materials and devices since the electrical and 
thermal energy can be effectively transport in the 
orderly structures9,10. For practical example, the 
breakthrough of the Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattices 
(ZT~2.4) were considered as the results of an 
effective increase of the state density near the 
Fermi level and the phonon transport resistance 
contributed by the quantum confinement effect11. 
Due to these exhilarating investigations, many 
efforts have focused on the preparation of 
assembles of Bi2Te3 nanocrystals with various 
morphologies, e.g. nanoparticles12-14, nano- 
wires9,15, nanorods10,16, and nanoplates17,18, to 
introduce the spatial confinement. However, till 
now, most cases of the nanocrystal assembles 
are randomly-aligned to substrates. It is hence 
not easy to obtain predicted significant 
thermoelectric properties. Well-aligned Bi2Te3 
nanostructures prepared by template- or catalysis 
-free approaches were less reported. In addition, 
Bi2Te3 nanostructures with spatial confinements 
from 1-D to 3-D nanocrystals also have not been 
systematically fabricated and studied yet. These 
technological issues indeed need to be clarified 
for the further enhancement of thermoelectric 
materials. 
In this work, we present an optimized 
one-step, large-area, noncatalystic and template 
-free growth approach to distinct Bi2Te3 nano- 
structures by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). By 
optimizing the substrate temperature and 
background atmosphere, four physically self 
-assembled and well-aligned Bi2Te3 nano- 
structured films respectively consisting of 0-D 
nanoparticles, 1-D nanorods, 2-D nanoflakes, 
and 3-D nanocanyons with specific preferential 
orientations normal to the insulated SiO2/Si 
substrates were newly fabricated. Most

~880 nm (Fig. 1(d)). The triangle-like top view 
(Fig. 1(h)) has an average width of ~440 nm 
(Fig. 2(d)). 
According to the XRD patterns as shown 
in Fig. 3(a), all these four nanostructures can be 
mainly identified as the Bi2Te3 rhombohedral 
phase (JCPDS 89-4302) with respective 
out-of-plane preferential orientations. It is 
surprising that the recorded peaks for 0-D 
nanoparticles seem perfectly random, however, 
the relative high integrated intensity of the (006) 
peak indicating the occurrence of the 
anisotropic growth. For the well-aligned 1-D 
nanorods, the (015) direction clearly dominated 
the out-of-plane preferential growth. The only 
impurity peak found neighbor to Bi2Te3 (015) 
was identified as Te (101) (JCPDS 89-4899), 
which might originate from the wider spatial 
distribution of the Te plume than that of the Bi 
one because of the feasible volatile behavior of 
the Te element in PLD19. For the 2-D 
nanoflakes, the (110) peak is determined as the 
preferential orientation by numerical analysis 
with other peaks. In contrast to the (015) and 
(110) preferential orientation for the nanorods 
and nanoflakes, respectively, the 3-D 
nanocanyons display a strong c-axis preferential 
orientation, i.e. (006). The chemical 
composition and binding energy of these four 
nanostructures were evaluated by EDS and XPS, 
respectively. Four elements, Bi, Te, Si and O 
can be clearly observed in the EDS spectra. The 
deviation of the Bi/Te composition (see Table 1) 
with the substrate temperatures is frequently 
observed in various deposition techniques. The 
binding energy of 157.2 eV and 162.5 eV 
shown in Fig. 3(b), and of 572.2 eV and 582.5 
eV in Fig. 3(c) can be indexed as the 4f7/2 and 
4f5/2 band for Bi0, and 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 band for 
Te0, respectively. The absence of the oxidation 
states for both Bi and Te is in agreement with

conductivity from the four-probe method is 230, 
29, 78, and 70 Scm-1, which is close to the result 
of the Hall measurement. The Seebeck 
coefficient (see Fig. 6(b)) for the 0-D to 3-D 
Bi2Te3 nanostructures exhibit similar levels with 
that for intrinsic Bi2Te3 bulk, which also 
confirm their n-type semiconductor behavior. 
Higher deposition temperatures (2-D and 3-D) 
seem important for obtaining of higher Seebeck 
coefficients where the averaged value is -91, 
-81, -132, and -143 μVK-1 for the 0-D to 3-D, 
respectively. However, the electrical conduc 
-tivity would be generally sacrificed with the 
Seebeck coefficient increasing due to the 
opposite tendency for these two parameters. 
The in-plane power factor is 1.90, 0.19, 
1.35, and 1.43 Wcm-1K-2 respectively for the 
0-D to 3-D nanostructures as shown in Table 2. 
The present dry synthesis process is considered 
to provide clean and solid contacts between 
nanoparticles (see Fig. 3(b) and (c)). It is thus to 
achieve the relative high power factors. For 
instance, the present dense 0-D nanoparticle 
(~19 nm diameter) films exhibit about eight 
times higher in the electrical conductivity but an 
only ~40 % lower in the Seebeck coefficient 
comparing with the sintered pellets completely 
consisted with nanoparticles (~39 nm 
diameter)13. In addition to the grain conductance, 
of course the particle size would also be an 
important issue. When the nanoparticle size of 
the pellets decreases to sub 10 nm,12 a further

Conclusions 
We have successfully demonstrated the 
systematic fabrication of physically self- 
assembled and well-aligned Bi2Te3 nano- 
structures on SiO2/Si substrates without pre- 
built templates or catalysts by PLD at various 
substrate temperatures ranging from 250 to 550 
oC. The building nanocrystals of the prepared 
Bi2Te3 nanostructures were clearly identified as 
the 0-D nanoparticles, 1-D nano- rods, 2-D 
nanoflakes, and 3-D nanocanyons and were 
found to be orderly-aligned on SiO2/Si 
substrates with an overall (006), (015), (110), 
and (006) preferential orientation, respectively. 
The well-aligned 0-D to 3-D Bi2Te3 nano- 
structures show excellent in-plane power factor 
of 1.90, 0.19, 1.35, and 1.43 Wcm-1K-2, 
respectively. It is worth to notice that most of 
the randomly-aligned intrinsic Bi2Te3 nano- 
structured films generally present values smaller 
than 1 W cm-1K-2 at room temperature. The 
experimental evidence provided that the 
significant improvement in the power factor 
mainly originates from to the reduction of the 
inter resistance.
