英文摘要 
 
The first part of the present research employed a thin buffer layer deposited by thermal 
evaporation at high temperature to inhibit the nucleation of c-plane ZnO on the -LiAlO2 (LAO) 
substrate.  Results showed that the processing temperature window for the m-plane ZnO can be 
effectively extended and the crystallinity of the epilayer is also improved.  High quality ZnO and 
Zn0.9Mg0.1O deposited on LAO have been obtained by chemical vapor deposition.  The FWHM 
values of the (1010)ZnO rocking curves are in the range of 216-468 arcsec.  Various lattice defects, 
such as misfit dislocation, threading dislocation, basal stacking faults and inversion domain 
boundaries, have been characterized mainly by transmission electron microscopy.  Basal stacking 
faults are the major defects correspond to the deterioration of the photoemission property. A long 
time annealing at temperatures higher than 600oC can effectively reduce the density of the Basal 
stacking faults.   
Nonpolar (1010) oriented ZnO has been deposited on (100) LiGaO2 (LGO) substrates by 
chemical vapor deposition.  At 650oC or above, the epitaxial deposition of ZnO from the gas 
phase is in competition with the volatilization of Li from the substrate surface.  Zn and O are 
incorporated into the Li-depleted LGO substrate and ZnGa2O4 (ZGO) spinel nanocrystals are 
formed on the substrate surface.  On the other hand, the (1010)-oriented ZnO grains, which 
nucleate epitaxially on the LGO substrate, have to grow laterally over the spinel nanocrystals to 
form a continuous epilayer.   
Cu-alloyed GaN epilayers were prepared by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy in a 
Ga-rich environment with Cu-to-Ga beam equivalent pressure ratios of 1.2 to 4.8 %.  Islands 
enriched with Cu are found on all the GaN epitaxial layers.  The islands are composed of a 
Cu9Ga4 intermetallic phase and GaN with the orientation relationship: [111]Cu9Ga4//[1 210]GaN and 
(10 1 )Cu9Ga4//(0001)GaN.  The formation mechanisms of the islands are discussed in detail.  
Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses indicate that the 1.2 % and 4.8 % samples 
contain 0.10  0.02 wt.% Cu and 0.04  0.03 wt.% Cu, respectively.  Both samples show 
ferromagnetic behavior with a magnetization of in a range of 2.3-5.1x103 A/m at saturation.  A 
strategy to suppress the island formation and increase Cu incorporation is accordingly proposed 
and verified.

the magnetic moment contributed by Cu atoms.  The understanding of the Cu incorporation in 
GaN can provide useful information for preparing Cu-added ZnO epilayers. 
The solutions of the above mentioned problems rely on thorough characterizations on the 
microstructures and physical properties of the epilayers.  The present study therefore aims at : 
(1) characterizing the microstructure and optical properties of the (1100)-oriented ZnO epilayer 
grown on the (100) LAO substrate by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using x-ray 
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron 
microscopy/cathodoluminescence (SEM/CL),  
(2) clarifying the mechanism of the epitaxial growth of the (10 1 0)-oriented ZnO on the (100)LGO 
substrate by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), with special emphasis on the interfacial 
stability of the substrate.  
(3) analyzing the content of soluble Cu in GaN and proposing accordingly the growth strategy of 
Cu added GaN.   
 
2. Experimental 
Single crystals -LiAlO2 and -LiGaO2 5 cm in diameter were grown in the [100] direction 
using the Czochralski pulling technique.  After cutting and polishing, LAO and LGO wafers of 
the (100) surface with RMS roughness of ~0.8 nm were obtained and used as substrates 
throughout the experiments.  The substrates were cleaned successively in ultrasonic baths of 
acetone and methyl alcohol for 10 minutes each.  The ZnO films were deposited on the wafers in 
a horizontal CVD reactor of two temperature zones.  Zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (Zn(C5H7O2)2．
H2O, Lancaster, 98%) was employed to be the zinc source and was loaded into the 
low-temperature zone of the reactor.  The source temperature was controlled at 100-120oC to 
vaporize the solid reactant and the vapor was carried by a N2/O2 gas mixture into the high 
temperature zone of the reactor in which thesubstrate was placed.  Prior to the CVD process, the 
chamber was pumped to less than 1 Pa, refilled with nitrogen and oxygen, and maintained a 
constant pressure of 2.7x104 Pa.  The flow rates of nitrogen and oxygen were 500 sccm, 
respectively.  The deposition time was varied from 33 to 180 minutes.  In addition, a novel 
approach was employed to grow nonpolar ZnO in a bigger processing window.  The substrate 
was first deposited a very thin layer of ZnO by thermal evaporation at 600-800oC in CVD 
chamber followed by regular CVD process.    
Cu-alloyed GaN epilayers were grown on (0001) sapphire substrates by plasma assisted MBE 
in a Riber compact 21 system equipped with three effusion cells for Al, Ga and Cu.  The 
substrates were glued on Si (100) wafers with In.  After outgasing the substrate in a loadlock 
chamber, the samples were first exposed to an activated nitrogen flux with a pressure of 3.2x10-5 
Pa at a temperature of 200oC for nitridation. A 6 nm thick AlN was formed after 180 minutes.  
After nitridation, an AlN buffer layer of 25 nm thick was deposited under slightly Al-rich 
condition.  Subsequently, Cu-alloyed GaN epitaxial layer was grown at a substrate temperature of 
750oC  (thermocouple reading) for two hours under Ga-rich condition.   The growth rate was 
estimated to be 65 nm/hour.  Three samples having Cu-to-Ga beam equivalent pressure (BEP)

Fig. 2 shows the x-ray diffraction patterns obtained in a configuration for the ZnO

for 120 min.  For the samples without a buffer layer, the intensity of the (10-10)ZnO peak 
increases and that of the (0002)ZnO one decreases, with increasing the growth temperature.  It is 
clear demonstrated that the buffer layer inhibits the nucleation of the c-plane ZnO so that the 
samples with a buffer layer possess a much stronger (10-10) ZnO peak than the ones without the 
buffer layer.

at 550oC for 120 min.  
 
As mentioned above, only the buffer layer deposited at 800oC is a continuous layer.  Fig. 4 
shows the x-ray rocking curves of the (10-10)ZnO reflection for samples deposited at 550oC for 
120 min with a buffer layer obtained at two temperatures.  The continuous buffer layer results in 
a lower FWHM value.

The defects in the m-plane ZnO is indeed relatively low and the result coincides well with 
the low FWHM values of the XRD measurements mentioned above.  Fig. 10 is the CL results 
obtained at 300K.  Fig. 10a shows the CL spectrum in which a strong near-band emission at 3.29 
eV is observed with a FWHM value of 90 meV and the intensity of the yellow emission is low.  
Figs. 10b and 10c show the SEI image and the corresponding CL monochromatic image at 3.29 eV.  
The CL image reveals that numerous dark lines parallel to (0001)ZnO are observed inside the 
stripes.  The density of the dark lines is ~5x104 cm-1 and is very close to that of BSFs.  These 
dark lines are thus possibly resulted from the BSFs in the epilayer [37].   
A magnesium doped sample (, Zn1-xMgxO, x=0.1) was also prepared and annealed at 700 oC 
for 360 min.  SEI image indicated that the sample has the same morphology characteristics as its 
ZnO counterpart.  X-ray rocking curves of the (1100)ZnO reflection possessed a very low FWHM 
(full width at half maximum) value of 216 acrsec as the x-ray beam was parallel to [1120]ZnO.  A 
larger FWHM value of 684 arcsec was also yielded for the beam being perpendicular to [1210]ZnO.  
Evidently, post-growth annealing improved the crystallinity and reduced the defect densities. 
Fig. 11 are the plane-view TEM BFIs obtained from area where LAO is still left at g=0002 
and g=1120, respectively.  Fig. 11a shows no contrast resulted from dislocations at all, whereas 
evident dislocations roughly in parallel to the ZnO/LAO interface are shown in Fig. 11b.  The 
phenomenon is exactly the same as that for ZnO.  In other words, the dislocations are misfit 
dislocation exhibited at the interface with b=

Room-temperature CL analysis was carried out for the sample.  Fig. 13a shows the CL 
spectrum in which a strong near-band emission at 3.55 eV is observed with a FWHM value of 150 
meV and the intensity of the yellow emission is moderate.  In addition, radiation at 1.79 eV is 
also observed.  The peak is resulted from the 2nd order interference of the near band emission.  
Figs. 13b and 13c show the SEI image and the corresponding CL monochromatic image at 3.5 eV.  
The CL image reveals that dark lines parallel to (0001)ZnO are observed inside the stripes.  But its 
density is significantly less than that of the ZnO epilayer, indicating the density of the BSFs is 
lower in the ZMO sample.

The FWHM value of the rocking curve of the (1010)ZnO peak decreased with increasing 
deposition time, indicating that the islands with large tilting angles were merged into those with 
small tilting angles during growth.  Moreover, samples deposited at a higher temperature of 
700oC possessed a much smaller FWHM value at the short deposition time of 3000 s.  These 
indicated that the crystallinity of the epilayers can be improved both by prolonging the deposition 
time and by increasing the growth temperature.      
As mentioned above, fine crystals of about 20 nm in size are observed on the substrate at 
short deposition time.  In-plane TEM observations were carried out to characterize the 
nanocrystals in detail.  Fig. 15a shows the bright field image (BFI) of the sample deposited at 
650oC for 33 min and Fig. 15b are the corresponding selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of 
LGO and ZnO in the [100]LGO and [1010]ZnO zone axes.  The orientation relationship between 
LGO and ZnO is thus confirmed as (100)LGO//(1010)ZnO, and [001]LGO//[0001]ZnO.  Additional 
diffraction arcs are observed which can be indexed as LiGa5O8 (a=0.830 nm), ZnGa2O4 (a=0.833 
nm) or -Ga2O3 (a=0.822 nm) spinel structures [38-40], in the [100] zone axis.  Since Auger 
spectrum indicates that the nanocrystals contain Zn, Ga as well as O with a Ga/Zn ratio of about 2, 
they are therefore assigned as a ZnGa2O4 (ZGO) phase.  Although the diffraction arcs extend to 
20 degrees, an approximate orientation relationship appear to exist between ZGO and LGO that 
the three principle axes are roughly parallel, i.e., [100]ZGO//[100]LGO and [010]ZGO//[010]LGO, with 
a deviation of ~10 degrees.  Fig. 15c is the dark field image (DFI) from the (002)LGO/(0002)ZnO 
spots showing ZnO of 100 nm or larger in size.  Slightly distorted Moire fringes are observed due 
to a combination effect of the difference in d-spacing and a very small rotation between ZnO and 
LGO as shown in Fig. 15b.  The distortion of the Moire fringes indicates that defects, such as 
misfit and threading dislocations, are present in ZnO.  Fig. 15d is the DFI from (0 4 4 )ZGO 
verifyinging that the ZGO crystals possess much smaller sizes in a range of 5 to 40 nm.

Fig. 17 Cross-section TEM (a) BFI and (b) energy dispersive X-ray spectra acquired from the 
ZGO layer of the sample deposited at 700oC for 50 min. 
 
The epitaxial layer grown at 700oC for 50 min was also observed by TEM along [001]LGO.  
Fig. 17a is a BFI acquired in a two beam condition showing a double-layer structure.  The ZGO 
layer is about 40 nm thick and is covered by ZnO of ~100 nm in thickness.  The corresponding 
energy dispersive X-ray spectra acquired from the ZGO and ZnO layers, respectively are shown in 
Fig 17b.  The spot size of the incident electron beam is 3 nm.  No Ga is detected in ZnO, but a 
significant amount of Ga is detected in ZGO.  Since the sample is situated on a Cu grid, Cu 
radiation is observed in both spectra due to the spurious effect.  Totally five detections were 
made for ZnO and ten for ZGO.  The spectra are analyzed based on the Cliff-Lorimer approach 
using k-factors provided by the software vender (Oxford).  The O concentration of ZnO is 
estimated as 59.5+/-4.3 at.%, indicating that the k-factor of O is overvalued by a factor of ~1.4.  
The concentrations of Zn, Ga and O of ZGO, nevertheless, are calculated as 12.6+/-4.9, 23.4+/-5.6 
and 64.0+/-6.2 at.%.  The oxygen concentration is 12% higher than the stoichiometric value as 
18 
 
constant of 0.820 nm is very close to that of ZGO.  Accordingly, the formation of ZGO probably 
involves the following reactions:   
5LiGaO2 = 2Li2O + LiGa5O8 
2LiGa5O8 + 5ZnO = Li2O + 5ZnGa2O4 
Another possibility is that the spinel Ga2O3 phase is an intermediate phase of the 
decomposition of LGO.  However, the formation energy of Ga2O3 phase is larger than that of 
Ga2O3, as verified by Rawn and Chaudhuri [17] that the Ga2O3 phase appears on the 
decomposition of LGO.  The only possibility is that the co-existance of Zn and O stabilizes the 
Ga2O3 phase.  In other words, LGO may transform directly to ZGO due to the volatilization of 
Li with the assistance of Zn and O.   
Growth of ZnO on LiGaO2 
ZnO does not form on ZGO since a highly oriented ZnO epitaxial film cannot grow on a 
layer of poorly oriented ZGO crystals.  Accordingly, ZnO must nucleate first on LGO and then 
the formation of ZGO follows.  Therefore there is only a small portion of the LGO substrate 
surface in direct contact with ZnO.  The lattice mismatch between ZnO and LGO is 2.9 % in the 
direction of [010]LGO and [11 2 0]ZnO and 3.8 % in the direction of [001]LGO and [0001]ZnO.  As a 
result, misfit dislocations are expected to form at the interface.  The overgrowth was reported to 
ensure a low density of threading dislocations in ZnO.  As a consequence, high quality ZnO 
epitaxial films with low density of threading dislocations can be grown on the LGO substrate duo 
to the lateral overgrowth mechanism.   
Deep acceptor center has been reported in Li-doped ZnO which produces broad 
luminescence at 2.0-2.5 eV [41-43].  The emission was suggested to be of a donor-acceptor pair 
character.  The deep acceptor is originated from Li which is in substitution of Zn and is located 
0.81 eV above the valance band whereas the nature of the donor is still unresolved [44, 46, 47].  
However, the yellow emission peak has also been attributed to the radiative emission at 
oxygen-vacancy related defects [45, 48, 49]. The concentration of oxygen vacancies was 
suggested to increase with the diffusion of Li into ZnO [50, 51].   In the present study, a strong 
yellow emission with a FWHM of 0.5 eV is observed in the ZnO films deposited on LGO.  It is 
quite possible that has been incorporated or diffused into ZnO on deposition, althoug its 
concentration is too low to be detected by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (result not shown).  
The strong yellow emission is thus mainly attributed to the doping effect of Li.  It is to be noted 
that the yellow emission from the film deposited at 700oC possesses a slightly higher intensity 
than the one at 650oC due to the high Li volatilization rate at high temperature.  However, the 
possibility that part of the yellow emission may be contributed from the substrate can not be ruled 
out.  The poor near-band emission observed in the film deposited at 700oC may also be related to 
the incorporation of Li [52].  Further study is nevertheless needed.

(a=0.8747 nm, P 4 3m) [53].   The Cu9Ga4 layer is a single crystal and indeed possesses a 
well-defined orientation relationship with the bottom GaN layer.  Fig. 20f shows diffraction 
patterns of Cu9Ga4 , GaN and AlN taken along the [10 1 0] direction of sapphire.  It indicates that 
both GaN and AlN have their [1 210] direction parallel to [10 1 0]sapphire and one of the <111>Cu9Ga4 
is also parallel to [1 210]GaN.  The orientation relationship between GaN and Cu9Ga4 is thus 
identified as: [111]Cu9Ga4//[1 210]GaN and (10 1 )Cu9Ga4//(0001)GaN.  In addition, discrete GaN 
islands scattered on the Cu9Ga4 layer, indicated by arrows in Fig. 20b, are observed.

Figs. 22a and 22b are TEM bright field images of type-B and type-C islands, respectively.  
Figure 22a shows that the Cu9Ga4 phase, having a mountain-like cross section, is also capped by a 
top GaN layer.  The GaN underneath the Cu9Ga4 phase is only 10 nm thick.  Figure 22b shows 
the bright field image of a type-C island of about 500 nm in size.  The Cu9Ga4 crystal is 
embedded deeply in GaN.  However, there is no GaN underneath the Cu9Ga4 crystal.  Instead, 
the Cu9Ga4 crystal is grown directly on the AlN buffer layer.  In addition, the type-C island is 
much thinner than the other types of islands.

EDS spectra were collected in cross-section TEM observation, but failed to detect Cu in GaN.  
The Cu content in GaN, if any, is accordingly lower than the detection limit of energy dispersive 
spectroscopy of ~0.1 at.%.  In addition, the samples were examined by WDS in in-plane 
direction.  The energy of the electron beam was 15 keV and the excitation volume of GaN was 
about 1 m in diameter.  Three spots were chosen on the flat GaN epilayer for each sample with 
the closest island located at least 3 m away from the center of the spot.  The samples were 
etched by HNO3 for 5 minutes prior to the microanalysis to dissolve all Cu and Cu9Ga4 on the 
surface.  Table 1 summarizes the intensities of the Cu and Ga peaks and the corresponding 
Cu-to-Ga peak ratios of the two samples.   The 1.2 % and 4.8 % samples contain 0.10 0.02 
at.% Cu and 0.04 0.03 at.% Cu, respectively.  No Cu composition of the 2.8 % sample was 
yielded due to a serious charging problem upon analysis, though the sample indeed shows 
ferromagnetism.  The Cu content is estimated directly from the Cu-to-Ga peak ratio since the 
ZAF correction cannot be carried out for the heterostructure [54].  It is worth noticing, however, 
that Cu possesses a high mass absorption coefficient of 271.2 cm2/g for Ga K.  This indicates 
that part of the generated Ga Kx-ray is absorbed by Cu atoms in GaN and excess Cu K 
radiation can be excited by the Ga Kone.  TheCu content given above is probably 
overestimated.     
24 
 
crystal of Cu9Ga4 was observed to be located directly on the AlN buffer layer (Fig. 20b) or on a 
thin layer of GaN (Figs. 19b and 20a).  It is reasonable to believe that Ostwald ripening plays an 
important role in the formation of these islands.  In Ostwald ripening, atoms from the small 
droplets diffuse to the large ones [64].  Due to an extremely high diffusivity of Ga on the surface 
[65, 66], the Ga in the small droplets should be depleted much faster than Cu, and the Cu content 
of the droplets reaches the liquidus line within a short period of time.  Further outward diffusion 
of Ga results in the precipitation of the Cu9Ga4 phase at the AlN(GaN)/solution interface 
epitaxially.  Both the precipitation of Cu9Ga4 and the Ostwald ripening depleted the droplets and, 
finally, a layer of GaN is deposited on the Cu9Ga4 islands epitaxially from the gas phase upon 
subsequent growth.  The mountain-like shape of the Cu9Ga4 phase indeed results from a 
gradually decreased size of the droplets.  The smaller the droplet, the earlier the precipitation of 
Cu9Ga4 is and the faster the droplet is exhausted.  The capped GaN layer on the smaller islands is 
therefore thicker than that on the larger islands.  The type-A/B tails are probably formed due to 
the coalescence of a type-A and a type-B islands.  
Cu content in GaN 
Since the majority of Cu adatoms diffuse into the droplets, there is only a very small amount 
of Cu which can be incorporated in GaN grown from the gas phase.  The WDS analysis shown in 
Table 1 reveals that about 0.04~0.10 at.% Cu is dissolved in GaN.  In addition, sample having a 
higher BEP ratio (4.8%) contains less Cu in GaN.  This phenomenon is probably due to the fact 
that a higher fraction of the sample surface is covered by the liquid droplets and thus fewer Cu 
atoms can be incorporated in GaN formed from the gas phase.  The GaN formed through the 
VLS mechanism underneath the Ga-Cu droplets may contain no or less Cu.  All the three 
samples are ferromagnetic with the magnetization at saturation of 5.1x103, 1.7 x103 and 2.3 x103 
A/m, respectively, for the 1.2 % , 2.8% and 4.8 % samples.  It worth noting that the values are 
proportional to the measured Cu contents dissolved in the matrix, indicating that the 
ferromagnetism is attributed from the Cu alloying.    
Growth Strategy 
Based on the above discussion, the formation of the discrete Ga-Cu droplets on the surface is 
responsible for the precipitation of the Cu9Ga4 phase.  In fact, many 3d transition metals possess 
binary phase diagrams with Ga very similar to that of Cu-Ga [67, 68].   In other words, other 
MxGay intermetallic compounds can be formed in MBE growth of metal-alloyed GaN following 
the mechanism established for the Cu9Ga4 phase.  Consequently, the GaN epilayer should be 
grown under N-rich environments to avoid excess Ga appears on the surface.  Indeed, a similar 
conclusion has been drawn in a processing study for Fe alloyed GaN prepared by plasma assisted 
MBE [69].    
A preliminary attempt to grow Cu-alloyed GaN under a N-rich condition was therefore 
carried out.  The sample was grown in three steps after nitridation.  First, a 25 nm buffer layer 
was grown at low substrate temperature and slightly Al-rich condition.  Second, a 130 nm GaN 
layer was grown under a slightly Ga-rich condition.  Last, a Cu-alloyed GaN epilayer of the same 
thickness followed under a slightly N-rich condition with a Ga-to-Cu BEP ratio of 1.7%.  Fig.

prolonging deposition time and by increasing growth temperature.  A layer of nanocrystalline 
ZGO is found between ZnO and LGO.  The ZGO results from the volatilization of Li from LGO 
and has an approximately orientation relationship with LGO of: [100]ZGO//[100]LGO and 
[010]ZGO//[010]LGO up to 10 degrees deviation.  The (1010)-oriented ZnO grains, which nucleate 
epitaxially on the LGO substrate, have to grow laterally over the ZGO nanocrystals to form a 
continuous epilayer.  The ZnO film deposited at 650oC has a strong excitonic emission peak and 
a broad yellow emission peak.  The later is attributed to the incorporation of Li in ZnO and the 
LGO substrate. 
Cu-alloyed GaN epilayers were prepared by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy in a 
Ga-rich environment with Cu-to-Ga beam equivalent pressure ratios of 1.2 to 4.8 %.  Islands 
enriched with Cu were found on all the GaN epitaxial layers.  The large, equaxed islands are 
composed of a top Cu9Ga4 intermetallic layer and a bottom GaN layer which is about twice as 
thick as the GaN layer grown from the gas phase. The thick bottom GaN layer is grown via a VLS 
mechanism and an orientation relationship between GaN and Cu9Ga4 was identified as 
[111]Cu9Ga4//[1 2 10]GaN and (10 1 )Cu9Ga4//(0001)GaN.  The long, dendritic islands and the fine, 
equiaxed islands are resulted from the precipitation of the Cu9Ga4 phase in the small, 
oversaturated droplets.  Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses indicated that the 1.2 
% and 4.8 % samples contains 0.10 0.02 wt.%Cu and 0.04 0.03 wt.%Cu, respectively.   No 
islands are formed on the surface and only a small amount of the Cu9Ga4 precipitates are found in 
GaN as the film is prepared under a N-rich condition.   As much as 5 at.% of Cu can be 
incorporated in GaN.

Cu-alloyed GaN epilayers were prepared by plasma assisted 
molecular beam epitaxy with Cu-to-Ga beam equivalent 
pressure ratios of 1.2 to 4.8 %.  Islands enriched with Cu are

samples contains 0.10 0.02 wt.%Cu and 0.04 0.03 wt.%Cu, 
respectively.     
 
Introduction 
 
Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) based on III-nitrides alloyed with 
transition metal elements have attracted attention recently for possible applications in 
spintronic devices (1-4).  Cu is one of the elements considered for alloying in DMS 
since first principle calculation predicted that Cu has a ferromagnetic ground state in 
GaN with a magnetic moment of 2B/Cu (5-8).  Applying Cu alloying can also avoid 
controversy regarding the origin of ferromagnetic ordering since metallic Cu and all 
possible Cu-Ga alloys are not ferromagnetic (3, 4).   
Ganz et al. demonstrated very recently that Cu-alloyed GaN epilayers grown by 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) are ferromagnetic at room temperature (9).  However, 
the nominal magnetic saturation is lower than the theoretical prediction using the 
Cu-to-Ga beam equivalent pressure ratio to determine the nominal Cu doping.  This 
1.2% (Fig. 1a), three island morphologies are observed: large, equiaxed islands of 2~10 
m in diameter, long, dendritic ones of ~1 m wide as well as fine, equiaxed ones of 
0.1~1 m in diameter.  For simplicity, these islands are named type-A, -B and -C 
islands, respectively.  By increasing the BEP ratio to 2.8 %, the size of the type-A 
islands increases (see Fig. 1b).  Some of the type-A islands possess a long tail which 
is similar in shape to the type-B islands.  The long tail of the type-A island is 
therefore named type-A/B island.  In Fig. 1c, the number fraction of the type-A 
islands increases associated with dramatic decreases of that of the type-B and type-C 
ones.  The sample having a BEP ratio of 2.8 % was used for further microstructural 
analysis since all types of the islands can be easily allocated on the sample. 
Cross section TEM samples were prepared by focus ion beam technique to 
collect morphologic, crystallographic and compositional information of the islands.  
Figure 2a is a bright field image of a FIB sample made from the center of a type-A 
island.  The image shows that the GaN epilayer is about 100 nm thick whereas the 
island is as thick as ~400 nm.  The island is mainly composed of two parts: a thick top 
layer with uneven thickness and a bottom GaN layer having a thickness twice as much 
as that of the neighboring GaN.  The interface of the two layers is flat.  The top layer 
contains 68.8 wt.% Cu and 31.2 wt.% Ga according to the energy dispersive X-ray 
spectrum in Fig. 2b which corresponds

ratios of (a) 1.2 %, (b) 2.8 %, and (c) 4.8 %. 
 
to a Cu9Ga4 phase.  A series of select area diffraction (SAD) patterns were taken from 
the top layer and two of them are shown in Figs. 2 c-d as examples, confirming that it 
Cu9Ga4 crystal is embedded between a thin, flat bottom GaN layer of ~60 nm thick and 
an irregular top GaN layer.  Diffraction analysis (result not shown) indicates that the 
Cu9Ga4 crystal follows the same orientation relationship with the bottom GaN as that 
described previously.  Figure 3b shows the cross section image of a type-B island.  
The Cu9Ga4 phase, having a mountain-like cross section, is also capped by a top GaN 
layer.  The GaN underneath the Cu9Ga4 phase is only 10 nm thick.  The maze-like 
pattern shown in the Cu9Ga4 phase is probably due to the antiphase domains.  
However, further studies are needed to clarify this.  Figure 3c shows the bright field 
image of a type-C island of about 500 nm in size.  The Cu9Ga4 crystal is embedded 
deeply in GaN.  In fact, the Cu9Ga4 crystal is grown directly on the AlN buffer layer.  
Moreover, the type-C island is much thinner than the other types of islands.

Figure 3. TEM bright field images of (a) type-A/B, (b) type-B, and (c) type-C islands. 
 
Our TEM results reveal that the islands possess basically two kinds of 
mircostructures.  One is composed of three layers: a discrete top GaN, a thick, uneven 
Cu9Ga4 in the middle and a thick, uniform GaN at the bottom.  The interface between 
the Cu9Ga4 phase and the bottom GaN is flat and the orientation relationship between 
them is identified.  This is the microstructure found for type-A islands.  Another one 
the Cu content in GaN is higher than that in AlN.  However, no Cu K peak is found 
in the EDS spectra acquired from GaN, and the higher Cu intensity probably results 
from a relatively high fluorescence background.  The Cu content in GaN, if any, is 
accordingly lower than the detection limit of energy dispersive spectroscopy of ~0.1 
wt.%.   
In addition, the samples were examined by WDS in in-plane direction.  The 
energy of the electron beam was 15 keV and the excitation volume of the sample was 
about 1 m in diameter.  Three spots were chosen on the flat GaN epilayer for each 
sample with the closest island located at least 3 m away from the center of the spot.  
The samples were etched by HNO3 for 5 minutes prior to microanalysis to dissolve all 
Cu and Cu9Ga4 on the surface.  Table 1 summarizes the intensities of the Cu and Ga 
peaks and the corresponding Cu-to-Ga peak ratios of the two samples.   The 1.2 % 
and 4.8 % samples contain 0.10 0.02 wt.% Cu and 0.04 0.03 wt.% Cu, respectively.  
The Cu content is estimated directly from the Cu-to-Ga peak ratio.  It is well known 
that the generated and measured x-rays in electron beam microanalysis are affected by 
matrix factors such as atomic number of element (Z), mass absorption of x-ray (A) and 
x-ray fluorescence (F).  A ZAF correction has therefore to be carried out in order to 
obtain compositions as close to the real values as possible (11).  However, the 
correction has not been performed in the present case since the size of the excitation 
volume (~1 m) is larger than the film thickness (~150 nm).  ZAF correction is too 
complicate to be conducted for such a heterostructure (11).  It is worth noticing, 
however, that Cu possesses a high mass absorption coefficient of 271.2 cm2/g for Ga 
K.  This indicates that part of the generated Ga Kx-ray is absorbed by Cu atoms in 
GaN and excess Cu K radiation can thus be excited by the Ga Kone.  TheCu 
content given above is probably overestimated.     
 
TABLE 1 Summary of the WDS analyses 
Ga-to-Cu BEP ratio, % Cu Kcps Ga Kcps Cu content, wt.% 
1.2 76+/-15 37266+/-761 0.10+/-0.02 
4.8 30+/-19 36775+/-198 0.04+/-0.03 
 
The magnetic behavior of the samples coincides well with the compositional 
analysis.  The magnetic moment of dissolved Cu atoms is estimated as 3.4 sat /Cu and 
2.4 sat /Cu, respectively, for the 1.2 % and 4.8 % samples.  The values coincide with 
the theoretical one predicted by Wu et al. within the order of magnitude (5).  However, 
as discussed above, the Cu contents are slightly overestimated and the magnetic 
moment of Cu atoms derived in the present study is about 50 % higher than that 
predicted.

A single crystal -LiGaO2 5 cm in diameter was grown in the [100] direction using 
the Czochralski pulling technique.  After cutting and polishing, LGO wafers of the 
(100) surface with RMS roughness of 0.8 nm were obtained and used as substrates 
throughout the experiments.  The substrates were cleaned successively in ultrasonic 
baths of acetone and methyl alcohol for 10 minutes each.  The ZnO films were 
deposited on the LGO wafers in a horizontal CVD reactor of two temperature zones.  
Zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (Zn(C5H7O2)2．H2O, Lancaster, 98%) was employed to be 
the zinc source and was loaded into the low-temperature zone of the reactor.  The 
source temperature was controlled at 110oC to vaporize the solid reactant and the vapor 
was carried by a N2/O2 gas mixture into the high temperature zone of the reactor in 
which the (100)LGsubstrate was placed.  Prior to the CVD process, the chamber 
was pumped to less than 1 Pa, refilled with nitrogen and oxygen, and maintained a 
constant pressure of 2.7x104 Pa.  The flow rates of nitrogen and oxygen were 500 
sccm, respectively.  The deposition time was varied from 2000 to 7200 seconds. 
 
Following the CVD growth, a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, 
JEOL JSM-6700F, operating at 10 kV) was used to examine the surface morphology of 
the epitaxial films.  X-ray diffraction studies were performed in a Siemens D-5000 
diffractometer (XRD, Cu-K radiation) equipped with a graphite monochromater 
mounted in the secondary side to monitor the crystallinity of the epitaxial films.  
Auger electron microscopy (AES, JEOL JAMP 9500F at 10 kV) was employed to 
analyze the composition of crystals, having different morphology and size, grown on 
the LGO substrate.  Detailed microstructural characterization of the films was carried 
out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010 operating at 200 kV).  
The in-plane TEM samples were prepared by grinding and polishing the specimens 
from the substrate side to ~20 m thick followed by Ar ion milling (Gatan PIPS-691) 
to electron transparency.  The cross-section samples were fabricated by focused ion 
beam (SMI 3050) technique.  Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room 
temperature by a Horiba HR 800 spectrometer using a 325 nm He-Cd laser as the 
excitation source.  
 
Results and Discussion 
 
SEM micrographs of the ZnO films deposited at 600, 650 and for 700oC for 7200 s 
are shown in Figs. 1a-c, respectively.   Fig. 1a shows that the substrate surface is 
covered by fine ZnO grains, about 100 nm in size, with random oriented facets at 
600oC.  On raising growth temperature to 650oC, the substrate is covered by crystals

(0 4 4)ZGO of the ZnO film deposited at 700oC for 3000 s. 
 
SEM observation for sample deposited at 650 and 700oC showed that fine crystals 
of about 20 nm in size coexist with elongated ZnO islands on the substrate at short 
deposition time (result not shown).  In-plane TEM observations were therefore 
carried out to characterize the nanocrystals in detail.  Fig. 3a shows the bright field 
image (BFI) of the sample deposited at 700oC for 3000 s and Fig. 3b are the 
corresponding selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern of LGO and ZnO in the [100]LGO 
and [1010]ZnO zone axes.  Additional diffraction arcs, though faint, are observed 
which can be indexed as LiGa5O8 (a=0.830 nm), ZnGa2O4 (a=0.833 nm) or -Ga2O3 
(a=0.822 nm) spinel structures (16-18), in the [100] zone axis.  Since Auger spectrum 
(result not shown) indicates that the nanocrystals contain Zn, Ga as well as O with a 
Ga/Zn ratio of about 2, they are therefore assigned as a ZnGa2O4 (ZGO) phase.  
Although the diffraction arcs extend to 20 degrees, an approximate orientation 
relationship appear to exist between ZGO and LGO that the three principle axes are 
roughly parallel, i.e., [100]ZGO//[100]LGO and [010]ZGO//[010]LGO, with a deviation of 
~10 degrees.  Fig. 3c is the DFI from (0 4 4)ZGO showing that the ZGO crystals 
possess small sizes in a range of 5 to 30 nm.  
  
The diffraction contrast is contributed by LGO and the result indicates that the ZnO 
crystals nucleate directly on LGO.  Finally, Fig. 4d shows the energy dispersive X-ray 
spectrum acquired from the ZGO layers.  The atomic ratio of Zn, Ga and O is about 
1.5:1.5:4.  In other words, the nanocrystals are indeed a ZnGa2O4 phase with a portion 
of Ga substituted by Zn.        
 
The current results show that ZnO films deposited on LGO at relatively high 
temperatures of 650-700oC suffer a problem of interfacial reaction so that ZGO is 
formed.  SEM and TEM results indicated that both ZnO and ZGO crystals forms on 
the substrate surface in the very beginning of deposition.  The formation of the ZGO 
crystals is probably associated with the decomposition of LGO and the inward 
diffusion of Zn and O.  Rawn and Chaudhuri (14) reported that Li volatilization from 
LiGaO2 resulted in the formation of LiGa5O8 and -Ga2O3 at temperatures above 
900oC.  The surface became rough due to the transformation (13).  According to the 
BFI shown in Fig. 4a, the interface between ZGO and ZnO is much rougher than the 
original substrate surface (Ra~0.8 nm).  However, the -Ga2O3 phase can not be the 
first decomposition product of LGO in the present case, since the low crystal symmetry 
of -Ga2O3 (monoclinic, C2/m) will result in many ZGO variants on LGO instead of 
the only one observed (19).  On the other hand, the LiGa5O8 phase has an inverse 
spinel structure (space group P4332) and its lattice constant of 0.820 nm is very close 
to that of ZGO (16).  Accordingly, LGO may decompose to LiGa5O8 and/or Ga2O3 
and then transform to ZnGa2O4 in sequence.
