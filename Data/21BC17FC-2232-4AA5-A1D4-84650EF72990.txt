Abstract 
The purpose of this project is try to develop an easy and cheap ‘universal computer workstation’. It could 
provide more adjustable design and assistant devices that makes it easy to use a computer with sitting, reclined 
or supine postures. This workstation would satisfy the requirements of both normal people and most 
handicapped persons. This project is the second year (period) of the continuous project. It is aimed at 
determining the optimal positions for keyboard and mouse while using computer at supine posture by 
ergonomic experiment methodology. The experimental results indicate that the participants had significantly 
higher performances and lower muscle effort when using the mouse under preferred setting, as compared with 
the guideline setting. However, little difference in typing performance was found between the guideline and 
preferred settings. We combined the experimental results and the workstation design from the first year and 
then make the prototype of the computer workstation. At last, we tested the usability of the prototype. After 
several reviewing and refining, the universal computer workstation that can satisfy most people’s requirements 
were be accomplished.

users and reduce discomfort of muscle and bones, such as the ergonomic mouse, ergonomic chair, 
ergonomic workstations, and arm support apparatus. These equipments have only limited effects of 
alleviating muscular and skeletal discomfort, and offer temporary convenience or comfort to users 
because current computer operations are static and in prolonged sitting positions, giving rise to 
muscular and skeletal discomfort. 
Modern employment of most people means prolonged operation of a computer in a sitting position, 
thus, fatigue easily occurs, and in the home, when changing posture to lying down, and using a 
computer for entertainment, chatting, or typing, while at ease, not only can release psychological 
stress, but also alleviate muscular and skeletal burdens. Lower-extremity disadvantaged population 
often feel very uncomfortable, sore muscles from the daily use of a computer, those not adapted to 
prolonged sitting [3], experience great discomfort related to computer operations and body posture. 
Therefore, this study was dedicated to understanding how to set up a keyboard and a mouse when 
using a computer in supine posture. It is hoped that people could lie in bed and operate a computer, 
feeling comfortable, convenience of operation, and alleviating muscular and skeletal discomfort [4]. 
The goal of this study was to study and compare the effect of keyboard and mouse setting dur ing 
computer work with a supine posture. More specifically, the study was designed to test the 
following hypotheses during copy typing and mouse dragging tasks: 
(a) Preferred setting will result in better performance and lower muscle effort compared with the 
guideline setting during copy typing task. 
(b) Preferred setting will result in better performance and lower muscle effort compared with the 
guideline setting during mouse dragging task. 
2   Methods 
Ten healthy adults and ten people with disabilities of the lower extremities participated in this study. 
All participants used the mouse with their right hand. The healthy participants use the computer for 
over ten hours per week. All the handicapped participants had experience of computer use. 
The experimental tasks included copy typing, mouse dragging and mouse stability operations. 
Participants completed a 20min copy typing task in each of two conditions: (a) guideline setting of 
keyboard and mouse; (b) preferred setting of keyboard and mouse. Testing order was randomized. 
Participants were given a 15min break between the two conditions. Immediately following the 
typing task, the mouse dragging task was performed. The mouse dragging task required the 
participant to move the mouse quickly following a tortuous path presented on the screen (Fig 1). 
During standardized computer work, the work performance in terms of typing score, typing speed, 
and mouse task completion time were registered. 
In the guideline setting condition, the keyboard and mouse were arranged to let the participant’ 
elbow bend at 90 degree, as shown in Fig. 2. In the preferred setting condition, an adjustable 
keyboard tray and mouse tray were used to be adjusted freely by the participant, as shown in Fig. 3. 
 
found between these two settings. For the mouse dragging task, the mean %MVC value of the 
extensor carpi ulnaris muscle EMG was significantly greater under guideline setting compared with 
preferred setting; however, no significant differences in %MVC of sternocleidomastoid muscle 
EMG were found between these two settings. Overall the preferred setting of keyboard and mouse 
could lead to lower effort in some muscle no matter during typing or mouse dragging tasks.

4   Discussion 
In the current study, computer work tasks were performed with a supine workstation either under 
the guideline setting or under personal preferred setting of keyboard and mouse. Interestingly, all of 
the participants preferred to put the mouse alongside their right hip. Personal preferred setting could 
lead to better performance during mouse dragging task, but had no significantly better performance 
during typing task compared with the guideline setting. This result means that the traditional 
guideline setting for sitting workstation is not suitable for using a supine workstation, especially 
dragging a mouse. In addition, the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle EMG results also confirmed that 
preferred setting could lead to obviously lower muscle effort (16.42% MVC) during mouse
