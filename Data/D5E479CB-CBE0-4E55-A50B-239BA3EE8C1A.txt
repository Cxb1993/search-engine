potential to integrate the processes of artificial 
microenvironment include development of engineered 
scaffolds； change of functions and behaviors of 
cells to be a new cell resource； and establishment 
of artificial microenvironment composed of 
biochemical, physical, and topographical cues used to 
influence regenerated cell adherence, viability, 
proliferation, migration and differentiation. 
    In the first year, we patterned biological 
molecule (Laminin) using soft lithographied stamp to 
study how signals provided by microenvironment orient 
cell growth. We investigated the efficacy of 
microcontact printed laminin to align and redirect 
Schwann cells growth. Experimental results show that 
microcontact printing is a potential way to pattern 
cell-recognition molecule on scaffolds for guided 
neural cell growth in tissue regeneration. In the 
second year, we modified regular electrospinning into 
rotating multichannel electrospinning (RM-ELSP) to 
produce microparticles and nanofibers simultaneously. 
Gelatin nanofibers (0.1–1 μm) and polycaprolactone 
(PCL) microparticles(0.5–10 μm) were formed and 
well-mixed. Adjusting the concentration of PCL and/or 
gelatin, we can fabricate various microparticles / 
nanofibers composites with different sizes of PCL 
particles and different diameters of gelatin 
nanofibers depending on their concentrations (2–10%) 
during electrospinning. Using PCL particles as a pore 
generator, we obtained gelatin nanofiber scaffolds 
with controllable pore size and porosity. Cells 
adhere and grow into the scaffold easily during in 
vitro cell culture. In the third year we developed 
microfluidic pattern green fluorescent protein 
expressing mouse mesenchymal stem cell (GFP+ mMSCs) 
and red fluorescent protein expressing (RFP+) neuron 
cells separately on the same cover glass. The 
microfluidic patterned coculture system engraved 
using the laser micromachining might help us to 
evaluate the neural differentiated of mMSC into 
neuron-like cells. It has potential to understand

1、Introduction  
The microenvironment, the niche of cell, plays 
an important role in cell behavior and function 
(Fuchs, Tumbar et al. 2004; Arai, Hirao et al. 2005). 
Cells dynamically respond to biochemical, 
mechanical, and topological cues derived from their 
microenvironment including gradient of soluble 
cytokines (Yu, Meyvantsson et al. 2005), interaction 
with the extracellular matrix (Aigner and Stove 2003; 
Sands and Mooney 2007), and communication 
between cells (Bhatia, Balis et al. 1999). In addition 
to its programmed differentiation capacity, one cell 
lineage is able to adopt other fates via extrinsic 
induced pathways such as juxtacrine: membrane 
proteins of one cell surface interact with receptor 
proteins of an adjacent cell, and paracrine: secreted 
proteins from one cell diffuse to induce changes of 
neighboring cells (Alexanian 2005).  
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are 
programmed for mesodermal lineages differentiation, 
including osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and 
adipogenesis in vivo. However, when detached from 
the physiological niche, the in vitro cultured MSCs 
also have the plasticity to express the ectoderm 
neural markers and can adopt morphological 
characteristics of neurons and astrocytes (Kopen, 
Prockop et al. 1999). Secreted soluble factors from 
neuron cells and physical contact with neuron cells 
may cause/ facilitate the co-cultured MSCs to cross 
germinal boundaries, a process called 
transdifferentiation. However, from a regular 
co-culture system with randomly mixed two cell 
types, it is difficult to differentiate whether the 
neural protein expression of MSCs is induced from 
the pathway of paracrine, juxtacrine, or both 
(Alexanian 2005). Although, a semipermeable 
membrane of transwell co-culture system was 
employed to separately culture two kinds of cells 
without contacting each other in the same medium 
(Wislet-Gendebien, Hans et al. 2005), cells are 
separated far enough and /or the membrane could be 
an additional diffusion barrier for secreted soluble 
factors. Furthermore, it is difficult to find out what 
actually causes MSCs to transdifferentiate into 
neuron–like cells based on the fragmented and 
inconsistent results. Therefore, we designed the 
microfluidic patterned co-culture system, a 
straightforward and effective method to immobilize 
cells (Chiu, Jeon et al. 2000; Park and Shuler 2003; 
Tan and Desai 2003) and organize them in a 
controllable and reproducible way, to co-culture 
green fluorescent protein expressing (GFP+) mouse 
MSCs (mMSCs) and red fluorescent protein 
expressing (RFP+) neuron cells for characterizing 
the facilitating way of transdifferentiation and 
determining the possibility of cell fusion. We used 
the direct-write CO2 laser microchanneling (Fogarty, 
Heppert et al. 2005) to manufacture a microfluidic 
patterning device and evaluated the cell plasticity 
with the use of the expression of neural markers, 
beta tubulin III and glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), in MSCs. The effect of neural cells direct

culture.  
 
GFP+ mMSCs were isolated from bone marrow of 
the femurs and tibias of GFP+ mice at 6 to 
8-weeks-old and cultured at a cell density of 2x105 
cells/cm2 with complete medium consisting of 
MEM alpha supplemented with 20% FBS with 2 
mM L-glutamine (InVitrogen, Gibco-BRL), 100 
U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Hsiao, 
et al.; unpublished). After incubation for 72 hr, the 
non-adherent cells were removed by refreshing the 
medium. Plastic-adherent GFP+ mMSCs from 
mouse marrow were purified by immunodepletion 
with magnetic microbeads conjugated to either 
anti-CD11b or anti-CD45 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec 
Paris, France). 
 
2.3 Microfluidic patterning 
The cell suspension, GFP+ mMSCs in MEM alpha 
and RFP+ neuron cells in DMEM/F12, was 
delivered individually into the microchannels of the 
microfluidic patterning device by simple injection 
(Fig. 1g). Cells attached to the substrate exposed to 
the microflow of cell suspension and were incubated 
at seeded densities of 3x106 cells/cm2 for 24 hr. 
After that, GFP+ mMSCs and RFP+ neuron cells 
were patterned separately on the cover glass and 
followed by culturing at 37 °C in differentiation 
medium (Fig.1h). Laser scanning microscope (LSM; 
Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and Axiovert 100TV 
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) were 
used to observe the cells’ behavior.  Four different 
culturing conditions were used to investigate the 
transdifferentiation mechanism: undifferentiated 
MSCs, microfluidic patterned co-cultured MSCs and 
neuron cells, randomly mixed co-cultured MSCs and 
neuron cells, and transwell co-cultured MSCs and 
neuron cells. In the randomly mixed co-culture, 
GFP+ mMSCs/neuron cells (1:1) were mixed and 
cultured at seeded densities of 1x105 cells/cm2 on a 
cover glass. In the transwell co-culture system, 
GFP+ mMSCs were seeded at densities of 2x105 
cells/cm2 and separately co-culture with neuron 
seeded at densities of 4x105 cells/cm2 in a 0.4 μm 
pore size transwell device (BD, CA, USA) in the 
same medium. 
 
2.4 Immuno-histochemistry analysis 
Before fixation, cells were cultured with 2.5 μg/ml 
Hoechst 33342 (InVitrogen, Gibco-BRL) for 30 min 
to stain nuclei. According to a standard 
immunohistochemistry analysis procedure, we used 
3 % paraformaldehyde (Wako) in phosphate buffer 
solution (PBS) to fix samples at 37 °C for 30 min. 
After that, we used 5 % FBS in PBS for 30 min at 
room temperature to block samples. The primary 
antibodies we used were rabbit anti-mouse beta 
tubulin IgG (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), rabbit 
anti-mouse GFAP IgG (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) 
(Anjos-Afonso, Siapati et al. 2004; Isakova, Baker et 
al. 2006) and mouse anti-mouse O4 (R&D Systems, 
USA) diluted 1:100 in 5 % FBS. All primary 
antibodies were applied to stain samples overnight at 
4 ℃ and then rinsed five times each with PBS. The 
secondary antibodies, Alexa-Fluor647 conjugated 
donkey anti-rabbit IgG (InVitrogen, Gibco-BRL) 
and Alexa-Fluor647 conjugated goat anti-mouse 
IgM (InVitrogen, Gibco-BRL), were applied at 
1:200 diluted in 5 % FBS for 3 hr. After five more 
rinses in PBS and mounting with glycerol/water 
(1:1), stained samples were inspected by LSM. 
 
2.5 Stereological cell count 
We used an unbiased stereological estimation of the 
total number of MSCs expressing neural 
markers(Gundersen and Jensen 1987; West, 
Slomianka et al. 1991) MSCs expressing neural 
biomarkers were identified by staining for both beta 
tubulin III and GFAP. Neural expression of MSCs 
were counted in randomly selected areas (375x375 
μm) using a 40x objective. At least thirty separate 
regions of each sample were photographed and 100 
9 
in blue signals, GFP+ mMSCs in green signals, 
RFP+ neurons in red signals, and Alexa-Fluor647, a 
dye spans near-IR spectra, conjugated antibody for 
beta tubulin III and GFAP in purple signals (Fig. 
6,7). GFP+ mMSCs expressed higher level of beta 
tubulin III (67.1 ± 14.5 %, t-test, p<0.01) and GFAP 
(86.2 ±5.9 %, t-test, p<0.001) without contacting 
with any neuron cells in the first day of microfluidic 
co-culture (Fig. 8). However, when used a traditional 
transwell co-culturing system to separately GFP+ 
mMSCs with RFP+ neuron cells, we obtained lower 
transdifferential ratio. mMSCs expressed beta 
tubulin III (59.8 ± 14.2 %) at almost the same level 
as their naturally expression of beta tubulin III (47.5 
± 9.5 %) and at lower expression level of GFAP (52 
± 5.4 %; t-test, p<0.05). 
 
During microfluidic co-culture, although dynamic 
cell migration might mingle the border between two 
cell types, most GFP+ mMSCs and RFP+ neuron 
cells still can be recognized into two groups creating 
co-culture condition consisted of physical contact 
and soluble factors induction (Fig. 9). LSM was 
used to comfirm if the neural biomarkers in purple 
signals were expressed within the GFP+ mMSCs 
(data not shown). 
 
3.5 Cell fusion 
When GFP+ and RFP+ signal colocolizating inside 
the same cell, it indicates the happening of cell 
fusion during co-culture. However, only a very few 
case of fused cell was observed (Fig. 10). Although 
neural biomarkers expressing MSCs could be the 
result of a cell fusion process between MSC and 
neuron cells, this phenomenon can also coexist 
during co-culture, they might not be the major cause 
of GFP+ mMSCs differentiating towards neural 
markers expressing neural-like cells after co-culture.  
 
4. Discussion 
Cell-cell interaction is a complex process. Secreted 
factors from adjacent neural cells do affect MSC 
behavior and function. In 2000, Sanchez-Ramos 
assessed the influence of cell-cell interactions and 
the factors released from developing neural tissue. 
They found that the interactions played an important 
role in neural differentiation of MSCs 
(Sanchez-Ramos, Song et al. 2000). Though several 
studies have reported that MSCs transdifferentiated 
into neuronal-like cells when co-culturing with 
neuron cells, the findings have been challenged for 
the lack of neural specific markers, the 
heterogeneous nature of the MSCs, and the random 
distribution of the co-cultured cell population (Song 
and Sanzhez-Ramos 2003; Krabbe, Zimmer et al. 
2005; Phinney and Prockop 2007). Our study 
demonstrated a novel design of microfluidic pattern 
GFP+ mMSCs and RFP+ neuron cells co-culturing 
system in order to evaluate that the neural 
expression of MSCs is facilitated by not only the 
juxtacrine via cell-cell contact but also the soluble 
factors mediated paracrine signaling. In our 
microfluidic patterned cell culture device, patterning 
cell is easy and straightforward without the need of 
complicated fabricating process or complicated 
pre-modified procedures for the culture plates or 
substrates as shown in literature (Bhatia, Balis et al. 
1999). Cells in our system were patterned with 
well-defined boundaries; besides, highly organized 
cell pattern provides us a better way to evaluate the 
cell migration, immune-cytochemistrical characters 
and transdifferentiation than randomly displayed cell 
pattern. Targeted cells could also be harvested from 
specific locations on the surface using laser 
microdissection and used for molecular level 
analysis (Lee, Jones et al. 2006). Moreover, with a 
defined cell border created by the microfluidic 
patterning, we could further identify the evident of 
cell fusion during co-culture. The fused cell reported 
both GFP+ and RFP+ signals indicated the 
possibility of cell fusion.
