Abstract
Location-awareness is crucial and becoming increasingly important to many applications in wireless sensor
networks. This project presents a network-based positioning system and outlines recent work in which we have
developed an efficient principled approach to localize a mobile sensor using time of arrival (TOA) and angle of arrival
(AOA) information employing multiple seeds in the line-of-sight scenario. By receiving the periodic broadcasts from
the seeds, the mobile target sensors can obtain adequate observations and localize themselves automatically. Based
on the distance measurements and the initial position estimate, adaptive fuzzy control scheme is applied to solve the
localization adjustment problem. The simulations show that the proposed approach provides adaptive flexibility and
robust improvement in position estimation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Due to the low power, lower cost, robust and distributed internal algorithms are required for sensor positioning
problems. Common ranging techniques are receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI), time of arrival (TOA), time
difference of arrival (TDOA) and angle of arrival (AOA). In order to estimate the position of a moving target
sensor in most environments, incorporating angle information may help tackle the localization problem in addition
to distance measurements. Thus, an AOA-aided TOA localization scheme may be employed to make the position
estimation possible. In general, the localization problem can be solved by the joint AOA/TOA positioning scheme
using a single seed [1]. However, in the case of poor observations, more AOA-aided TOA measurements may be
applied to complement the measurements [2]. Comprehensive surveys of design challenges and recently proposed
positioning algorithms for wireless networks can be found in [3]-[5].
In the propagation environments, some of the propagation paths between the target sensor and the seeds may
be non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. Several NLOS mitigation techniques [6], [7] have been proposed such that the

A. AOA-Aided TOA Measurement
As shown in Figure 1 (top left), due to the locations of the seeds, the time stamps of the received signals from
the seeds are different. Thus, a measurement modification may be applied to coordinate the distance information in
a scenario with multiple seeds. Assume that the unknown sensors are aware of their orientations. Figure 1 (top right)
depicts the concept of measurement modification. Let T0 be the broadcasting time of the seed. Let Ti be the time
stamp of the received signal from Seed i. Denote di as the distance between Seed i and the target sensor. Denote
△di as the movement of the target sensor from time stamp T0 to time stamp Ti. Denote φi as the direction of the
received signal from Seed i with respect to the orientation. Denote φm as the moving direction of the target sensor
with respect to the orientation.
Hence, based on di, △di, the AOA information, and the mobility model (e.g. the moving direction), the distance
measurement may be modified by
d′2i = d
2
i +△d2i − 2di△di cos(θi). (1)

2) Gradient Descent Learning: In Phase III, fuzzy logic and gradient descent method are used to adjust a suitable
answer for the target sensor position. The objective function is defined by E = 12(u − ud)2, where ud is a desired
output value for an input vector, and u is a fuzzy inference value. Here, we use the projections onto the x-axis of ⃗ˆdi
and d⃗i
′
to explain the operation of the fuzzy system and minimize the objective function E. In this case, the desired
output value for input vector x = [x1, x2, . . . , xN ]T is udi = x

i and the fuzzy inference value is ui = xˆ

1) Using TOA Information: Given variance of distance estimation σ2d = 0.01 and the number of samples of particle
filter (ranging from 25 ∼ 750 samples/area), Figure 3 (left) shows the location adjustment of the target sensor using
TOA information. Referring to the line with label - Particle Filter (TOA), it suggests that a better initial position
estimate in Phase II may be obtained with a larger sample size. Based on the initial estimation, Figure 3 (left)
further shows the improvement of positioning performance when applying the refinement schemes. Observe that the
performance of the adaptive fuzzy control with an increase in the number of iterative training may be superior to
that of the MCMC method with a smaller sample size. This is attributed to the fact that the number of MCMC
samples may have an influence on the particle set’s quality [14]. For the proposed fuzzy control method, the fitting
for training data is good.

2) Using AOA/TOA Information: Suppose that the target sensor receives AOA and TOA information to estimate its
own coordinate. The AOA measurement noise is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable and AOA is measured with
degree information. Similar to the results described in Figure 3 (left), Figure 3 (right) show that, given the variance
of distance σ2d = 0.01 and variance of angle σ
2
φ = 0, the position estimation error is suppressed with increasing
the number of samples (ranging from 25 ∼ 750 samples/area). Notice that compared with the MCMC method, the
adaptive fuzzy control using AOA and TOA information has less position estimation error. Figure 3 (right) also
demonstrates that incorporating accurate angle information may help tackle the localization problem in addition to
distance measurements. Hence, one possible way to approach network localization is to include other measurements
such as angle information and heading information [15] in order to suppress the computational complexity.
In Figure 4, given the variance of distance σ2d = 0.01 and σ
2
d = 0.5, we explore the estimation performance with
varying the variance of angle information. Notice that as shown in Figure 4 (left), the proposed adaptive fuzzy control

C. The Effect of Mobility on the ATPA
Given three seed locations P1 = [10, 25], P2 = [80, 25], and P3 = [50, 80], and the target moving from [30,30]
to [60,60] with speed 5 m/s, Figure 6 (top) shows the position error of x-axis and y-axis with varying the variance
of distance when using TOA information. We compare the estimation performances using the proposed positioning
method with fuzzy control and that with MCMC. Note that the MCMC position accuracy is better than that of
the fuzzy control with low distance variance in this example, but the fuzzy control scheme is computational cheap
compared with the MCMC algorithm. With a larger distance variance, the positioning accuracy of the fuzzy control
is better than that of the MCMC. In Figure 6 (bottom), with the AOA and TOA information and the variance σ2φ =
0.1, the proposed position system effectively reduces the position error. Compared with the positioning performances
with only TOA information (described in Figure 6 (top)), the MCMC scheme and the fuzzy control method have
superior positioning performances with TOA and AOA information (described in Figure 6 (bottom)), which suggests
that the AOA information may help to suppress the estimation error due to the noisy measurements (ranging from
-10 ∼ 0dB).

sensors are synchronized; (2) The target sensor will not dra-
matically change its moving direction; (3) The seeds broadcast
their position information periodically. The major steps for
distributed self-positioning are LOS identification, distance
measurement and modification, initial position estimation, and
estimation refinement, which are achieved by applying NLOS
mitigation techniques, AOA-aided TOA information, particle
filtering, and adaptive fuzzy control scheme, respectively.
The operations and design principles of the proposed ATPA
approach are detailed in the following subsections.
A. AOA-Aided TOA Measurement
As shown in Figure 1 (left), due to the locations of the seeds,
the time stamps of the received signals from the seeds are
different. Thus, a measurement modification may be applied
to coordinate the distance information in a scenario with
multiple seeds. Assume that the unknown sensors are aware
of their orientations. Figure 1 (middle) depicts the concept of
measurement modification. Let T0 be the broadcasting time of
the seed. Let Ti be the time stamp of the received signal from
Seed i. Denote di as the distance between Seed i and the target
sensor. Denote di as the movement of the target sensor from
time stamp T0 to time stamp Ti. Denote φi as the direction of
the received signal from Seed i with respect to the orientation.
Denote φm as the moving direction of the target sensor with
respect to the orientation.
Hence, based on di, di, the AOA information, and the
mobility model (e.g. the moving direction), the distance mea-
surement may be modified by
d′2i = d
2
i +d2i − 2didi cos(θi). (1)
Accordingly, Figure 1 (right) shows that given N seeds, the N
modified distance measurements may be applied to estimate
the location of the target sensor at time T0.
B. Geometrical Positioning with Particle Filtering
Given the modified distance measurements, the Bayesian
particle filter method may be applied to performance geomet-
rical positioning since it is robust to noisy measurements and it
allows for flexible information transmission. Assume the target
sensor m obtains new measurements from neighboring seeds
and estimates its own position. The target position is given by
the discrete-time state equation
xk = Φxk−1 + Γwk, (2)
where xk is the position of the mobile sensor and wk is an un-
correlated Gaussian diffusion term describing the uncertainty.
The measurement term for the target sensor m is
zk =
∑
∈Hm
∣∣|xmk − xk| − dm∣∣+ vk (3)
where the sum is over the nearby seeds with location xk,
dm represents the measured distance between the estimated
target sensor m and seed S; the measurement noise is another
uncorrelated zero mean Gaussian white noise process; the set
Hm is the chosen seeds for the measurement. After applying
particle filtering, the mobile sensor carries along a complete
distribution of estimates of its position, which is inherently an
accuracy measure of the positioning system.
C. Adaptive Fuzzy Control
Due to the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic controller in
minimizing the estimation error [9], an adaptive fuzzy control
system is developed to approach the true target coordinate.
1) Inputs of the Fuzzy Control: In the proposed fuzzy
control system, two scenarios are considered. For Scenario 1,
as depicted in Figure 2 (left), the target sensor has no AOA
information. Given the initial estimate of target position and the
reference position of Seed i, the vector ˆdi and angle θi (in radi-
ans) are obtained. Hence, the projections of ˆdi onto x-axis and
y-axis are xˆproji = dˆi cos(θi) and yˆ
proj
i = dˆi sin(θi). Instead
of using the estimated target position, the modified distance
measurement (i.e. di′ ) and angle θi are applied to find the pro-
jections, which are xproji = di
′
cos(θi) and yproji = di
′
sin(θi).
For Scenario 2, as shown in Figure 2 (right), the target sensor
has received AOA information. Following the same operations
above, we have xˆproji = dˆi cos(ϕi), yˆ
proj
i = dˆi sin(ϕi),
xproji = di
′
cos(Φi), and yproji = di
′
sin(Φi). Note that angle
Φi is captured from the AOA information and the information
of mobility model, and angle ϕi is derived from the initial
target position estimate and the reference position of Seed i.
A. MCMC v.s. Adaptive Fuzzy Control
Two sets of experiments are applied to evaluate the per-
formance of adaptive fuzzy control and the performance of
MCMC technique when using TOA/AOA information, and
those only using TOA information, respectively. In the sim-
ulation, the measurement errors are assumed to be Gaussian
random variables. Note that in the experimental illustration,
the line with the label - Particle Filter, represents the initial
position estimate in Phase II.
1) Using TOA Information: Given variance of distance
estimation σ2d = 0.01 and the number of samples of particle
filter (ranging from 25 ∼ 750 samples/area), Figure 3 (left)
shows the location adjustment of the target sensor using TOA
information. Referring to the line with label - Particle Filter
(TOA), it suggests that a better initial position estimate in
Phase II may be obtained with a larger sample size. Based
on the initial estimation, Figure 3 (left) further shows the
improvement of positioning performance when applying the
refinement schemes. Observe that the performance of the
adaptive fuzzy control with an increase in the number of
iterative training may be superior to that of the MCMC method
with a smaller sample size. This is attributed to the fact that
the number of MCMC samples may have an influence on
the particle set’s quality [14]. For the proposed fuzzy control
method, the fitting for training data is good.

2) Using AOA/TOA Information: Suppose that the target
sensor receives AOA and TOA information to estimate its own
coordinate. The AOA measurement noise is assumed to be a
Gaussian random variable and AOA is measured with degree
information. Similar to the results described in Figure 3 (left),
Figure 3 (right) show that, given the variance of distance σ2d =
0.01 and variance of angle σ2φ = 0, the position estimation
error is suppressed with increasing the number of samples
(ranging from 25 ∼ 750 samples/area). Notice that compared
with the MCMC method, the adaptive fuzzy control using
AOA and TOA information has less position estimation error.
Figure 3 (right) also demonstrates that incorporating accurate
angle information may help tackle the localization problem in
addition to distance measurements. Hence, one possible way
to approach network localization is to include other measure-
ments such as angle information and heading information [15]
in order to suppress the computational complexity.

Fig. 4. Estimation adjustment without AOA information; Estimation adjust-
ment with AOA information.
In Figure 4, given the variance of distance σ2d = 0.01 and σ2d
= 0.5, we explore the estimation performance with varying the
variance of angle information. Notice that as shown in Figure 4
(left), the proposed adaptive fuzzy control with moderate noisy
angle information may dominate the localization performance
under the circumstances of good distance estimation. However,
as shown in Figure 4 (right), even with the moderate noisy
angle information, the noisy distance information may have the
predominant influence and degrade the estimation performance
due to the performance loss caused by measurement uncertain-
ties and propagation environments. Therefore, the MCMC and
the proposed adaptive fuzzy control have roughly the same
estimation performance in this scenario.
B. Adaptive Fuzzy Control v.s. Fixed Fuzzy Control
This set of experiment compares the estimation performance
of the ATPA with an adaptive fuzzy control scheme and the
FLAME with a fixed fuzzy control method [12]. Simulation
study is conducted to show that the performance of the
FLAME approach is superior to those in [16], [17]. Thus, the
FLAME heuristic may provide a good way to benchmark the
performance of ATPA scheme. Here we examine the estimation
performance with two sets of fuzzy controller parameters. In
Figure 5 (left), appropriate initial settings of controller parame-
ters with fixed fuzzy rules may sensibly improve the estimation
accuracy. Observe that the performance gap between these two
methods is small. In contrast, as shown in Figure 5 (right),
inappropriate initial parameter settings with fixed fuzzy design
rules may make the estimation performance even worse since
the parameter settings may vary from different scenarios. Thus,
because of the lack of learning process, the estimation accuracy
with a fixed fuzzy control method may highly depend on the
parameter settings and fuzzy logic. On the other hand, even
with inappropriate initial settings, the proposed adaptive fuzzy
control scheme may still converge the estimation behavior and
suppress the estimation error. Therefore, the ATPA approach
owns adaptive flexibility when dealing with uncertainty in
position estimation.
C. The Effect of Mobility on the ATPA
Given three seed locations P1 = [10, 25], P2 = [80, 25],
and P3 = [50, 80], and the target moving from [30,30] to
[60,60] with speed 5 m/s, Figure 6 (top) shows the position
