1. Introduction 
Microspeakers are commonly used in many portable devices such as mobile phone, PDAs, 
and digital cameras, etc.  Apart from the traditional need to reproduce speech signals, 
microspeakers in these consumer electronic products are required to reproduce music signals 
with high intensity level and good sound quality.  Due to their small physical sizes and hence 
high fundamental frequencies, microspeakers are inherently incapable of rendering 
low-frequency signals.  To cope with this problem, this paper presents a systematic design 
approach for microspeakers with vented box enclosure, in light of electroacoustic analysis and 
optimiation procedure. 
The loudspeakers discussed in this paper are dynamic moving-coil type.  Like other 
electroacoustic transducers, the model of a loudspeaker involves electrical, mechanical, and 
acoustical domains.  As a low-frequency approximation, the loudspeaker can be modeled with 
electro-mechano-acoustical (EMA) analogous circuits and lumped parameters [1]-[4].  
Although not much literature on microspeakers can be found, as compared to large loudspeakers, 
some research are focused on aspects such as structure dynamic analysis of diaphragm, 
voice-coil impedance, cover perforation properties, [5]-[8], etc. 
This paper revisits low-frequency enhancement using vented-box and transmission line [3] 
methods with application in loudspeakers.  Vented-box design has long been used as a useful 
means in low-frequency extension.  Thiele [9]-[10] and Small [11]-[14] have laid the theoretical 
foundation for vented-box design in a series of classical papers.  Bai and Liao [15] applied the 
vented-box idea to design the acoustical enclosure of miniature loudspeakers for mobile phones.  
Along the same line, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the microspeaker, with the 
emphasis on the interactions between the microspeaker and the acoustical enclosure with a cavity 
and a port.  The port can be modeled as either a lumped mass or a transmission line.  Distinct 
from the prior research, the present work seeks to carry out the vented box design in a more 
analytic and systematic way.  As will be demonstrated later, the physics underlying the coupled 
mechanical and acoustical system is surprisingly parallel to that of a dynamic vibration absorber 
 3
2. Theory and Method 
A loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer that converts the electrical signal to sound 
signal.  The processes of the transduction are complex.  These cover the electrical, mechanical, 
and acoustical transduction.  In order to model the process of the transduction, the EMA 
analogous circuit can be used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the loudspeaker.  The circuit 
is overall and decomposed to electrical, mechanical, and acoustic part.  A loudspeaker is 
characterized by a mixed of electrical, mechanical, and acoustical parameters. 
 
2.1 Electrical-mechanical-acoustical analogous circuit 
The concept of the electric circuit often applied to analyze transducers in the electrical and 
mechanical system.  The technique analysis of the electric circuit can be adopted to analyze the 
transduction of the mechanical and acoustical system.  The simple diagram of EMA analogous 
circuit is shown in Fig. 1.  The subject of EMA analogous circuit is the application of electrical 
circuit theory to solve the coupling of the electrical, mechanical and acoustical system.  The 
EMA analogous circuit is formulated by the differential equations of the electrical, mechanical, 
and acoustical system and the differential equations can be model by the circuit diagram.  The 
rules of analytic methods are follows. 
For the electromagnetic loudspeaker, the diaphragm is driven by the voice coil.  The voice 
coil has inductance and resistance which are defined ER  and EL .  The term ER  and EL  are 
the most common description of a loudspeaker’s electrical impedance.  In order to model the 
nonlinearity of inductance, a resistance 'ER  can be parallel connected to inductance.  Thus, the 
electrical impedance of loudspeaker is formulated as: 
'( // )E E E EZ R j L Rω= +  (1) 
When the current ( )i  is passed through the voice coil, the force ( )f is produced and that 
drives the diaphragm to radiate sound.  The voltage ( )e  induced in the voice coil when it 
movies with the mechanical velocity ( )u .  The basic electromechanical equations that relate 
the transduction of the electrical and mechanical system are listed.

and perforation of the enclosure.  The acoustical impedance can be formulated as  
A AF ABZ Z Z= + , (9) 
The general acoustic circuit is shown in Fig. 3(a).  The ZAF means the impedance in the front of 
diaphragm and ZAB means that in the back side.  In general, the circuit would turn to Fig. 3(b) 
the general form in the electronics.  The following discussion will use this kind of circuit. 
The two basic variables in acoustical analogous circuit are pressure p  and volume velocity 
U .  Because of using impedance analogy, the voltage becomes pressure p  and current 
becomes volume velocity U .  Therefore, the ground of this circuit showing in Fig. 3 means the 
pressure of the free air.  Thus, it also can employ the concept about the mechanical system and 
the acoustical system can be coupled by the below two equations. 
s Df S p=  (10) 
DU S u=  (11) 
The equation s Df S p=  represents the acoustic force on the diaphragm generated by the 
difference in pressure between its front and back side, where DS  is the effective diaphragm area 
and p  is the difference in acoustic pressure across the diaphragm.  The volume velocity 
source DU S u=  represents the volume velocity emitted by the diaphragm.  From the Eqs. (10), 
the pressure difference between the front and rear of the diaphragm is given by 
( )AF ABp U Z Z= +  (12) 
Using Eqs. (10) and (11), force field can be transformed to pressure field. 
 
2.2 The method of parameter identification 
Almost all of the useful loudspeaker parameters had been defined by other researchers 
before Thiele and Small.  However, Thiele and Small made these parameters in a complete 
design approach and shown how they could be easily determined from impedance data. 
There are at least four methods for measuring Thiele and Small parameters from driver 
impedance data.  They are: 
1. Closed box (Delta compliance method)

Closed box method 
When the impedance of a mechanical system is 1M MS MS
MS
Z j M R
j C
ω ω= + + , the resonant 
frequency is 1S
MD MSM C
ω = .  When a driver is placed in a closed box, its resonant frequency 
rises.  This is because the inward cone motion is resisted not only by the compliance of its own 
suspension, but also by the compression of the air in box.  The compliance of the driver 
suspension is reduced by the compliance of the air spring.  If the total compliance has decreased, 
the resonant frequency of the driver will rise.  The concept can employed to calculate to the 
mechanical mass, mechanical compliance and mechanical resistance of the system. 
The closed box procedure for determining T/S parameters is given below: 
1. Measure Sf  and ESQ  using the curve fitting method 
2. Mount the driver in the test box.  Make sure there are no air leaks around the box and 
speaker.  One point must be noticed is that the testing volume for the case of 
miniature speaker must be less than 0.015L, or you can’t measure the realizable T/S 
parameters. 
3. Measure the new in-box resonant frequency and electrical Q using the same procedure 
as that used in step 1.  Label these new value Cf  and ECQ . 
4. Compute the ASV  as follows: 
( 1)C ECAS T
S ES
f QV V
f Q

where 1M  is the air-load impedance at low frequency. 
On the other hand, the parameters, and the mechanic resistance ( MSR ) and the motor constant 
( Bl ) can be calculated, using the following formula: 
 9
1 2 Ap p p R U= − =  (22) 
where AR  is the acoustic resistance of the screen.  The circuit is shown in Fig. 4(b). 
Theoretical formulas for acoustic resistance are generally not available.  The values are 
usually determined by experiments.  Table 1 gives the acoustic resistance of typical screens as a 
function of the area S  of the screen, the number of wires in the screen, and the diameter of the 
wires. 
Acoustic compliance 
Acoustic compliance is a parameter that is associated with any volume of air that is 
compressed by an applied force without an acceleration of its center of gravity. 
To illustrated an acoustic compliance, consider an enclosed volume of air as illustrated in 
Fig. 5(a).  A piston of area S  is shown in one wall of the enclosure.  When a force f  is 
applied to the piston, it moves and compresses the air.  Denote the piston displacement by x  
and its velocity by u .  When the air is compressed, a restoring force is generated which can be 
written Mf k x= , where Mk  is the spring constant.  (This assumes that the displacement is not 
too large or the process cannot be modeled with linear equation.)  The mechanical compliance 
is defined as the reciprocal of the spring constant.  Thus we can write

This equation involves the mechanical variables f  and u .  We convert it to one that involves 
acoustic variables p  and U  by writing and /f pS u U S= =  to obtain

follows from Eqs. (24). That the phasor pressure is related to the phasor volume velocity by

criterion that the air in the tube act as a pure acoustic mass is that its length must satisfy 8l
λ≤ , 
where λ  is the wavelength. 
Radiation impedance of a baffled rigid piston 
Radiation impedance can be easily explained by an example of the diaphragm vibration.  
When the diaphragm is vibrating, the medium reacts against the motion of the diaphragm.  The 
phenomenon of this can be described as there is impedance between the diaphragm and the 
medium.  The impedance is called the radiation impedance. 
The detail of the theory of radiation impedance is clearly described by Bernek.  The 
analogous circuit of the radiation impedance for the piston mounted in an infinite baffle is shown 
in Fig. 7.  The acoustical radiation impedance for a piston in an infinite baffle can be 
approximately over the whole frequency range by the analogous circuit.  The parameters of the 
analogous values are given by

Radiation impedance on a piston in a tube 
The flat circuit piston in an infinite baffle that is analyzed in the preceding section is 
commonly used to model the diaphragm of a direct-radiator loudspeaker when the enclosure is 
installed in a wall or against a wall.  If a loudspeaker is operated away from a wall, the acoustic 
impedance on its diaphragm changes.  It is not possible to exactly model the acoustic radiation 
impedance of this case.  An approximate model that is often used is the flat circuit piston in a

3. Simulation and experiment of loudspeaker 
A sample of a moving coil microspeaker with a 16 mm diameter and 4 mm thickness is 
shown in Fig. 10 (a).  The front view of the microspeaker without screen is shown in Fig. 10 (b).  
The diaphragm is covered by a metallic frame with one large circular hole with fifteen 
surrounding small circular holes.  Figures 10 (c) and (d) show the front view and the back view 
of the microspeaker without frame cover.  Figure 10 (e) shows the cross section diagram of the 
microspeaker.  The T-S parameters of microspeaker is shown in Table 2. 
 
3.1 Experiment and result of parameter identification  
In order to establish the electroacoustic model, the so-called Thiele and Small (T-S) 
parameters need to be identified via electrical impedance measurement [3]-[4].  While either the 
test-box method or the added mass method [3] can be used in the impedance measurement, the 
former method is preferred for the microspeakers discussed herein.  A 2cc test box was used in 
the experiment, as shown in Fig. 11.  The measured voice-coil impedance curves of the 
microspeaker with (solid line) and without (dotted line) the test-box is shown in Fig. 12.  The 
voice-coil resistance 7.26ER = Ω  can be directly read out from the figure.  The resonance 
frequency located from the peak of the impedance curve is 857.0 Hz.  After fitted with the 
small test box, the resonance frequency is pushed upward to 1218.75 Hz due to cavity 
compliance of the test-box.  A small peak is visible near 9 kHz in the voice-coil impedance.  
This is caused by the resonance of back chamber that is not removable from the loudspeaker.  
Using the procedure detailed in Ref. [18], the T-S parameters of loudspeaker can be extracted 
from the impedance data, as summarized in Table 1. 
 
3.2 System simulation and experiment 
With the identified T-S parameters of the microspeaker, the response of buzzer can be 
simulated on the basis of the EMA analogous circuit of Fig. 13.  In the acoustical domain, the 
impedance of acoustical load mainly consists of the acoustical impedance of the microspeaker

The overall EMA analogous circuit of a vented-box is shown in Figs. 15 (a) and (b), where the 
vent modeled as a lumped mass and a transmission line, respectively.  The acoustical 
parameters of ZAB is summarized in Table 4. 
 
4.2 Theory of Dynamic Vibration Absorber 
Vented-box design is a common approach to enhance bass response of conventional 
loudspeaker systems.  An engineering practice is to choose an acoustical resonance frequency 
( Aω ), or the Helmholtz frequency, approximately equal to the mechanical resonance frequency 
( Mω ), i.e., Aω ≅ Mω  such that the cavity-port system would create a resonance at a frequency 
lower than the original resonance frequency of the loudspeaker itself [3].  For theoretical 
justification on this engineering practice, an alternative view based on the vibration absorber 
theory [16, 17] will be presented in the following to gain more physical insight on the problem 
and hence more control on the subsequent acoustical design. 
 
4.2.1 Dynamic Vibration Absorber 
Consider a machine rotating with constant speedω , as shown in Fig. 16 (a).  The 
displacements responses, 1( )X ω and 2 ( )X ω , of this two degree-of-freedom system can be 
shown to be [16, 17]

acoustical mass and acoustical resistance will increase the on-axis SPL at the peak.  However, 
reducing acoustic mass, or equivalently, the mass ratio (ρ) will shift the acoustical resonance 
frequency (fA) to a higher frequency.  In case of a vented-box design, the preferred strategy is to 
select a smaller mass ratio and a design curve with greater frequency ratio (α) at the fixed 
normalize frequency ( 1r ) in the design chart.   After these search steps, a satisfactory design 
can generally be found. 
 
4.3 Optimal Design of microspeaker 
An optimization design procedure can be carried out, with the aid of the preceding 
microspeaker model.  The purpose is to find the best mechanical and acoustical parameters of 
the microspeaker to attain the maximum sound pressure output at the driving frequency under 
prescribed constraints.  The design chart method and the Sequential Quadratic Programming 
(SQP) algorithm are employed to find the optimal parameters.  The details of the SQP 
algorithm can be found the references [18] and [20-22]. 
Optimization formalism was employed to solve the micrpspeaker design problem on the 
platform of the SQP routine in the Matlab [23].  The syntax of the constrained optimization 
takes the following form augmented with various linear equality and inequality constraints: 
min ( )  subject to   0
                                   0

the microspeaker design problem considered herein, the on axis sound pressure at the 1st 
resonance frequency 400 Hz of microspeaker is defined as the cost function. 
In the following, the vented-box design of microspeaker problem shall be solved in light of 
 25
5. Simulation and Experiment 
Simulation and experimental investigations are undertaken in this paper to validate the 
aforementioned design optimization techniques.  A 2.83 Vrms swept sine signal is generated to 
drive a microspeaker, with the frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 20 kHz.  On-axis sound 
pressure response was measured by a microphone positioned at 10 cm away from the 
microspeaker. 
 
5.1 Response Simulation of the Microspeaker Design 
Simulation of the microspeaker was carried out on the basis of the EMA analogous circuit 
with pre-identified T-S parameters.  Figures 19 (a) and (b) show the voice-coil impedance and 
the on-axis SPL obtained from the simulation and experiment, respectively.  The simulated 
voice-coil impedance (dotted line) is in reasonable agreement with that of the measured data 
(solid line).  From Fig. 19 (b), the simulated on-axis SPL is greater than measurement by 2 dB, 
while the response trend of the simulation and measurement are quite similar.  Except for some 
minor discrepancies due to unmodeled structural and acoustical modes, the main features such as 
the main peaks are well captured by the lumped parameter model. 
In this section, optimization procedure is applied to obtain a low-frequency enhanced 
vented-box design.  To initiate the SQP constrained optimization procedure, the lower critical 
frequency of the pressure response of the coupled speaker-enclosure system is selected to be 400 
Hz.  The design variables are selected to be the port radius ( Pa ), the duct length ( PL ) and the 
volume of cavity ( ABCV ).  The results obtained using constrained optimization are summarized 
in Table 5. 
As mentioned previously, the duct can be modeled as either a lumped mass or a 
transmission-line.  Figures 20 (a) and (b) show the frequency responses of voice-coil impedance 
and on-axis SPL for the lumped mass model (solid line) and the T-circuit model (dotted line).  
In Fig. 20 (a) of the voice-coil impedance simulation, results of the lumped mass model and the 
transmission-line model are in very good agreement.  In Fig. 20 (b) of the SPL responses, the 
 27
resonance of the optimal vented-box design is greater than the non-optimal design by 2 dB.  At 
the 2nd resonance frequency, the on-axis SPL of original design is similar to the optimal design.  
In addition, the on-axis SPL between the two resonance frequencies of the optimal design is 
significantly greater than the original design.  This indicates that the proposed optimization 
technique is effective in enhancing the acoustic output of vented-box systems, even for very 
small loudspeakers like microspeakers.

ABSTRACT 
A novel sound field reconstruction technique based on a time-domain Nearfield 
Equivalence Source Imaging (NESI) approach is proposed to identify locations and 
strengths of noise sources.  Due to its time-domain nature, many problems of the 
conventional FFT-based methods such as spatial aliasing problem can be avoided.  
Tikhonov regularization that alleviates the ill-posedness inherent in the inverse problem 
with the least-squares optimization is employed to design multichannel time-domain 
inverse filters.  A windowing design is also suggested to cope with the defocusing problem.  
The DOR is selected according to the condition number of the propagation matrix.  In 
order to avoid singularity problems during processing, focus points are retreated away 
from the reconstruction surface.  Post-processing is carried out using the time-domain 
filters to calculate acoustical variables including sound pressure, particle velocity, and 
active intensity.  Furthermore, new features including the non-planar array, farfield 
reconstruction, and field interpolation/extrapolation are developed to enhance the present 
technique.  Simulations and experiments are conducted to justify the proposed NESI 
technique using a two-dimensional (2D) array.  Indicated in the results, the NESI technique 
proved effective in identifying sources of many kinds, including broadband, narrowband, 
stationary, and transient sources. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A successful noise control program relies on effective noise source identification.  
Accurate estimation of the location and strength of the source is crucial to the application of 
any noise control measures.  Noise source identification by sound field imaging using 
microphone arrays has received much research attention in recent years [1-2].  There are two 
main categories of microphone array techniques: the Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH) 
[3-4] and the acoustical beamformer [5-6].  The NAH that emerged in 80s due to Maynard 
and Williams et al. [3] and later extended to Spatial Transformation of Sound Field (STSF) 
by Brüel & Kjær [6] represents an early attempt to visualize sound fields using microphone 
arrays.  A comprehensive coverage of NAH can be found in the monograph by Williams [7].  
Another microphone array technique, the acoustical beamformer, employs array signal 
processing methods such as delay-sum algorithm, delay-filter algorithm, or high-resolution 
algorithm to determine the direction of incoming sound that is assumed to be plane waves 
from the farfield [5].  By this nature, the beamforming approach is thus well suited to 
localizing large-scale sources situated in the farfield.

where M I×∈G ^  is the propagation matrix modeling the radiation process between the point 
source and the sound pressure, 1M×∈p ^  is the sound pressure vector and 1I×∈q ^  is the source 
strength vector to be determined.  The purpose here is to design inverse filters J M×∈C ^  that 
best recover the source strengths by matching the path of GC to a model J I×∈W ^ , as depicted 
in Figure 1(b).  In the Figure, 1J×∈e ^  is the error vector.  The simplest choice of W would be 
the identity matrix I, where the problem reduces to, given p and G, finding an inverse filter C 
such that ≈ =CG W I  and hence 
ˆ = = ≈q Cp CGq q . (3) 
Usually, the number of microphones is no greater than that of the focused points ( M I≤ ), 
the propagation matrix can be square or underdetermined.  Alternatively, more sophisticated 
window design can be incorporated to the model W by including some null points near the 
edge to overcome spatial spillover and defocusing problem.

3 MULTI-CHANNEL INVERSE FILTERS 
3.1 Inverse filter design using Tikhonov regularization 
The inverse filtering problem depicted in Figure 1.  Ideal model matching requires that 
ˆ = =q Cp CGq .  However, the propagation matrix G is often ill-conditioned and even non-
square, which is a situation similar to deconvolution in the NAH.  This ill-posed nature is not 
necessarily due to the presence of evanescent waves but because of the finite size of the 
measurement surface.  When using the Helmholtz integral equation, we write the field at a 
given point in terms of the field values over a closed surface.  In our case, we have a ‘‘patch’’ 
for a measurement surface instead of a closed surface which produces this ill-posed nature.  
To overcome this difficulty, we employ the Tikhonov regularization in the matrix inversion 
process.  In the method, window design is calculated within: 
1( )H H β −= +C WG GG I , (4) 
where the regularization parameter 0β ≥  can either be constant or frequency-dependent. 
The inverse filter matrix C  in Equation (4) is a frequency-domain formulation.  The 
final touch calls for the inverse FFT along with circular shift to convert the frequency-domain 
inverse filters to the time-domain finite impulse response (FIR) filters.  It should be noted that 
the inverse FFT is only used in the off-line design stage, whereas the resulting inverse filters 
are entirely in the time-domain.  Apparently, the benefit of this approach lies in that many of 
the FFT limitations such as spatial aliasing, planar geometry, microphone spacing, and 
stationary conditions can all be lifted. 
Defocusing problem can likely arise when DOR is exceedingly large or when the 
number of microphones is less than that of the focus points ( M I≤ ).  To overcome the 
problem, windowing technique analogous to digital filter design can be incorporated to the 
model W.  “Null points” are added at the outer ring of the focal surface to suppress the side 
lobes, as shown in Figure 2(a).  Here, the window matrix takes the form 
The normal velocity at the normal direction can be calculated for a point source using the 
following formula: 
1( ) ( ) ( ) ( )n ru z F z p zcρ= ⋅n e , (8) 
where ρ  is the density of air, er = (x-x0)/r, r = |x-x0|, F(z) = (τ0/τ)[(1+gτ)z+(1-
gτ)]/[(1+gτ0)z+(1-gτ0)], g = 2πfp/tan(πfp/fs), fp being the bandwidth of interest, fs being the 
sampling rate, τ = r/c, and p(z) is obtained by ˆ( ) jkrq e rω −  in discrete-time domain. 
The instantaneous normal intensity is simply 
( , ) ( , ) ( , )n nI n p n u n=x x x . (9) 
Similar procedure applies to a collection of point sources, where the sound field can be 
calculated by using the principle of superposition. 
3.3 Beamwidth predicted by piston model 
In the farfield reconstruction, the beampattern of piston source model is employed to 
calculate aperture size of focal surface.  The piston source that dimension is equal to array is 
on the array.  In this paper, the piston source that shape is same array is rectangle.  Assume θ  
and φ  is degree of z to y and x to y.  Therefore, the piston model as follows 
( )( , )= ( ) ( ) x yj k x k yx yV k k x y e dxdy
∞ ∞ +
−∞ −∞∏ ∏∫ ∫ , (10)
where ( ) xjk xx eΠ =  is pi function.  Hence,

where x and y are the Cartesian coordinates, kx and ky are the wave number components in the 
x and y directions, and lx and ly is length in the x and y directions of rectangle piston source.  
To fix 90φ = D , the degree (θ ) on the first zero of Equation (11) is beamwidth of main-lobe.  
Therefore, the aperture of focal surface is calculate by 2 tan( )L θ . 
 
4 NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS 
In order to justify the NESI, numerical simulations and experimental investigations are 
conducted for 2D planar and non-planar rectangular arrays shown in Figure 2.  Practical 
sources including a scooter were chosen as the test targets for experiments to examine the 
proposed technique.  
4.1 Numerical simulation 
A simulation was undertaken for the planar rectangular array depicted in Figure 2(a).  In 
the first case, the number of microphones (M) was equal to the focus points (J).  Specifically, 
M = J = 4×4 in this simulation.  The spacing of the microphones (d) and the focus points (df) 
were both selected to be 0.1715 m (λ/2 corresponding to the fmax 1 kHz).  DOR (L) was 
chosen to be d and the retreat distance (Lr) was chose to be d/20.  For this DOR, the condition 
number was well below 103.  In the inverse filter design, the regularization parameter β was 
selected to be 5% of the smallest to the largest singular value of G.  Although the present 
technique is based on inverse filtering, the system can also be viewed in the context of 
beamforming.  However, unlike the conventional beamformers those are based on farfield 
assumptions, the NESI forms a focusing beam at the nearfield.  To better understand this idea, 
the beam pattern of NESI can be calculated.  The beam pattern is useful in that it gives the 
idea of spatial resolution of the beamformer and a check if the system has grating lobe or 
defocusing problems with the current array setting.  Therefore, the beam pattern associated 
with the focus point (0m, 0m) is shown in Figure 3(a).  Three random noise sources with

on the contour plot.  (a) The sound pressure received at the virtual microphones, (b) the source strength using 
the NESI with the virtual microphones. 
 
In the second case is a non-planar 4 4×  rectangular array shown in Figure 2(b) is 
employed in the numerical simulation.  The array parameters of M and J is same the first 
simulation.  Four points around the center of the array and the focal surfaces protrude from 
the planes to simulate the non-planar situation.  The respective planes are labeled as A to D-
surfaces in Figure 2(b).  The array parameters are: number of microphones and focus points 
M = J = 4×4, spacing between microphones and focus points d = df  = 0.343 m = 1 λ, 
maximum reconstruction frequency fmax = 1 kHz, DOR L = d, retreat distance Lr = L/20, 
protruding distance Lm = Lf = L/2.  Two rings of null points are padded around the boundary.  
For this DOR, the condition number of propagation matrix plotted versus frequency is well 
below 1000 throughout the interested band.  In the inverse filter design, the frequency-
dependent regularization parameter β was selected to be 5% of the smallest to the largest 
singular value of G.  To mitigate defocusing problem, window design was employed by 
surrounding the focus points with two ring of null points.  The beam patterns without and 
with window design associated with the focal point (0m, 0m) are shown in Figures 5(a) and 
(b).  This figure shows that the main-lobe is focused at (0m, 0m) with the window design, but 
is not focused without the window design.  By comparing these two plots, we observe that the 
window design is effective in reducing the grating lobe and the side lobe.  Two random noise 
sources band-limited to 1 kHz are situated at (0.686m, 1.029m) on the C-surface and (0.343m, 
0.343m) on the D-surface, respectively.  Of these two noise sources, one source is situated on 
the C-surface near the center, whereas another source is situated on the D-surface near the 
boundary.  Figure 5(c) shows the unprocessed rms sound pressure received at the 
microphones.  Figure 5(d) illustrate the processed rms values of the sound intensity obtained 
using the NESI technique.  In contrast to the barely resolvable image of the unprocessed rms 
pressure (Figure 5(c)), two sources are clearly visible in the NESI results (Figure 5(d)).  With 
this extremely large spacing and reconstruction distance (λ), the NESI remains capable of 
identifying noise sources with satisfactory accuracy.  Particularly, no significant spatial 
aliasing can be seen, even though a source is located right at the upper boundary. 
In the final case is a farfield reconstruction.  In this section, the aperture of focal surface 
is calculated by beampattern of piston source model.  The array parameters of M and J is 
same the first simulation.  The spacing of microphones ( d ) is 0.1715 m (λ/2).  DOR (L) is 
chosen to be 10d (farfield).  The beam pattern as shown in Figure 6(a), the degree of first zero 
is 20.  Consequently, the aperture of focal surface is 1.25 m.  In this numerical simulation, the 
aperture of focal surface is chosen to be 1.03 m that is smaller than 1.25 m.  The spacing of 
focal points (df) is 0.343 m when using aperture of focal surface is 1.03 m.  In the inverse

4.2 Scooter experiment 
In the following, a 125cc SYM scooter served as a more practical source to justify 
performance of the NESI technique.  The scooter is mounted on a dynamometer inside a 
semi-anechoic room.  The 4 4×  rectangular array was placed in front of the scooter engine 
case.  In the experiment, the array parameters are selected as M = J = 4×4, d = df  = 0.1 m = 
λ/2, fmax = 1.7 kHz, L = d , and retreated distance Lr = L/20.  For this DOR, the condition 
number of propagation matrix was well below 1000.  In the inverse filter design, the 
regularization parameter β  was selected to be 5% of the smallest to the largest singular value 
of G.   
The NESI was applied to reconstruct the sound field on the right side of the scooter 
running.  A run-up test from 1500 to 7500 rpm within ten seconds was conducted.  The 
unprocessed rms sound pressure received at the microphones is shown in Figure 7(a).  Figure 
7(b) illustrate the rms sound intensity reconstructed using the NESI.  These results clearly 
indicate that the cooling fan was the major noise source.  Therefore, this experiment proved 
that the proposed NESI technique applies to not only broadband random but also transient 
noise sources.

ABSTRACT 
In this paper, a design technique is proposed to extend the response of handset 
microspeakers toward low frequencies.  This technique aims at finding the optimal 
parameters of the vented-box configuration using a systematic design procedure based on 
vibration absorber theory, where the system is viewed as two coupled serial and parallel 
oscillators.  The characteristic equation of the vented box system is derived form the 
vibration absorber theory.  A simulation platform is established on the basis of an electro-
mechano-acoustical (EMA) analogous circuit. Electrical impedance and on-axis sound 
pressure level (SPL) of the microspeaker are simulated by solving the loop equations of the 
analogous circuit.  Based on the characteristic equation of the vented box system, a design 
chart is devised to determine the parameters such that the system delivers the maximal 
output at the low-frequency end.  In addition, a constrained optimization procedure is also 
applied to best reconcile the acoustic output and the enclosure constraints.  Experiments 
were conducted to justify the optimal design.  The on-axis SPL of the vented box system 
has been improved with the optimal design. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Microspeakers are commonly used in many portable devices such as mobile phone, 
PDAs, and digital cameras, etc.  Apart from the traditional need to reproduce speech signals, 
microspeakers in these consumer electronic products are required to reproduce music signals 
with high intensity level and good sound quality.  Due to their small physical sizes and hence 
high fundamental frequencies, microspeakers are inherently incapable of rendering low-
frequency signals.  To cope with this problem, this paper presents a systematic design 
approach for microspeakers with vented box enclosure, in light of electroacoustic analysis 
and optimiation procedure.  The microspeakers discussed in this paper are dynamic moving-
coil type.  Like other electroacoustic transducers, the model of a microspeaker involves 
electrical, mechanical, and acoustical domains.  As a low-frequency approximation, the 
microspeaker can be modeled with electro-mechano-acoustical (EMA) analogous circuits and 
lumped parameters [1]-[4].  Although not much literature on microspeakers can be found, as 
compared to large loudspeakers, some research are focused on aspects such as structure 
dynamic analysis of diaphragm, voice-coil impedance, cover perforation properties etc [5]-[8].

2.1 Frequency Response Simulation 
The response of microspeaker can be simulated on the basis of the EMA analogous 
circuit of Fig. 2.  In the acoustical domain, the impedance of acoustical load mainly consists 
of the acoustical impedance of the microspeaker and the radiation loading, respectively.  
Specifically, the acoustical impedance of the microspeaker takes into account the effects from 
the metallic frame, and a cavity between the metallic frame and diaphragm, as shown in Fig.

3.2 Theory of Dynamic Vibration Absorber 
Vented-box design is a common approach to enhance bass response of conventional 
loudspeaker systems.  An engineering practice is to choose an acoustical resonance frequency 
( Aω ), or the Helmholtz frequency, approximately equal to the mechanical resonance 
frequency ( Mω ), i.e., Aω ≅ Mω  such that the cavity-port system would create a resonance at a 
frequency lower than the original resonance frequency of the loudspeaker itself [3].  For 
theoretical justification on this engineering practice, an alternative view based on the 
vibration absorber theory [16, 17] will be presented in the following to gain more physical 
insight on the problem and hence more control on the subsequent acoustical design. 
3.2.1 Analysis of the Coupled System from the Vibration Absorber Viewpoint 
Figure 5 shows this structure in the mechanical domain, where a serial second-order 
oscillator circuit is coupled with a parallel second-order oscillator circuit.  When A Mω ω= , 
the motion of the mechanical system cancels that of the acoustical system, or alternatively 
viewed, the infinitely large impedance of the acoustical system “blocks” the motion of the 
mechanical system.  This is the unique feature of vibration absorber that is frequently 
exploited to suppress vibrations.

Solving for the roots of the characteristic equation (12) yields two undamped natural 
frequencies.  Note that the resonance frequencies of the coupled mechanical and acoustical 
system are generally different from, but strongly influenced by, those of the individual 
subsystems.  The resonance frequencies of the coupled system can be plotted versus the mass 
ratio ρ  for various frequency ratios α.  These loci of the resonance frequencies can be used 
for a design chart, as shown in Fig. 6.

A word of caution regarding how to use the design chart should be mentioned.  Reducing 
the acoustical mass and acoustical resistance will increase the on-axis SPL at the peak.  
However, reducing acoustic mass, or equivalently, the mass ratio (ρ) will shift the acoustical 
resonance frequency (fA) to a higher frequency.  In case of a vented-box design, the preferred 
strategy is to select a smaller mass ratio and a design curve with greater frequency ratio (α) 
at the fixed normalize frequency ( 1r ) in the design chart.  After these search steps, a 
satisfactory design can generally be found.  The design chart procedure was applied to obtain 
an optimal vented-box design, as shown in Fig. 7. 
3.3 Optimal Design of Vented-box Microspeaker 
An optimization design procedure can be carried out, with the aid of the preceding 
microspeaker model.  The purpose is to find the best mechanical and acoustical parameters of 
the microspeaker to attain the maximum sound pressure output under prescribed constraints 
[20-21]. 
In the following, the vented-box design of microspeaker problem shall be solved in light 
of the preceding optimization procedure.  To begin with, maximizing the 1st resonance 
frequency ( 1f ) of sound pressure output of vented-box design is selected to be the objective 
for optimization.  In this case, the volume of cavity ( ABCV ), the radius of port ( Pa ), and the 
duct length ( PL ) are to be determined.  The constraints are placed on design factors including 
the total volume, acoustical mass ( AM ), acoustical compliance ( AC ), acoustical resistance 
( AR ), 1f , and ( )sΔ .  Among these, Pa , PL and ABCV  are selected to be the design variables for 
optimization.  This can be written in terms of the following optimization formalism:

4 SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT 
Simulation and experiment investigations are undertaken in this paper to validate the 
aforementioned design optimization techniques.  A 2.83 Vrms swept sine signal is generated 
to drive a microspeaker, with the frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 20 kHz.  On-axis SPL 
response was measured by a microphone positioned at 10 cm away from the microspeaker.

mockup is shown in Fig. 10 (b).  The measured voice-coil impedance and on-axis SPL with 
the vent open (solid line) and closed (dotted line) are shown in Figs. 11 (a) and (b), 
respectively.  With the vent closed, there is a resonance peak whose frequency is labeled as f0.  
With the vent open, the voice-coil impedance exhibits a typical two-peak behavior of a 
vented-box design.  The on-axis SPL responses in Fig. 11 (b) demonstrate the effectiveness 
of the optimized vented-box design, where the bandwidth is extended to the low-frequency 
and the on-axis SPL is increased by 7 dB at the 1st resonance frequency.

5 CONCLUSIONS 
An optimization technique for the design of vented-box microspeaker system is 
presented.  The vented box design problem can bee closely related to the dynamic vibration 
absorber theory.  According to the theory, the characteristic equation of the vented box 
system was derived.  A design chart method and a constrained optimization method were 
devised to design the acoustic enclosure via the system characteristic equation. 
Using the EMA analogous circuit, voice-coil impedance and on-axis sound pressure 
response can be predicted by solving the loop equations of the analogous circuit.  The 
resonance frequencies of the coupled system are generally different from those of the 
individual subsystems.  From the characteristic equation, the resonance frequencies of the 
coupled speaker-enclosure system can be calculated.  The design chart method and the 
constrained optimization technique were employed to achieve low-frequency extension and 
maximize sound pressure output of the vented-box system under practical constraints.  
Despite the small size of microspeaker, both designs obtained using the optimization 
procedures provide significant performance improvement at low frequencies over the non-
optimal design in terms of sound pressure output.
