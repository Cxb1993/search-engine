We can realize that firms make use of contingent workers for cutting costs and
increasing the flexibility with respect to market fluctuations. Foote and Folta (2002)
also presented the real options theory that can offer managers the ability to consider
irreversibility and to make workforce investment decisions under conditions of
minimum uncertainty and maximum flexibility.
The demands of labor for most of the service systems, such as fast-food
restaurants and supermarkets, are varied from period to period. Thus, in order to
minimize system cost for developing competitive advantages, managers need to
determine staffing requirements, especially determine the work schedule for the
contingent workers.
Martinich (2002) indicated the competition for customers in retail service
industries, for instance, the fast-food, grocery and banking industries, is often fierce.
This competition occurs not only in price, but especially in perceived customer
service. According to Bennett (1990, p. B1),“no aspect of customer service is more
important than the wait in line to be served”, and “the wait can destroy an otherwise
perfect service experience.” Thus, even small reductions in waiting time will result
in better quality of service and lead to enhance customer loyalty and increase sales.
An excellent review for the issue of time and consumer behavior from differing
perspectives in the literature of economics, marketing and management science is
given by Jacoby et al. (1976). In this paper, the economist, J. Mincer, is quoted as
stating in his well known 1963 paper, “the properly defined price with which the
consumer is faced is not p, the market selling price, but p = p+c where c is the
opportunity cost of time.”(Jacoby et al., 1976, p.321) Although the importance of
waiting time as a form of price has been recognized, it is difficult to account for this
effect in making managerial decisions. Ittig (1994) mentioned two difficulties for
estimating the opportunity cost of waiting time. The first is that the waiting time
may vary in each customer, while the price may be fixed. The next is that the
monetary value of per unit of the waiting time during a shopping trip may vary widely
from one customer to another, and may have difficulty to estimate. Therefore, it is
more practical to consider using the concept of the waiting time as a form of the price
to estimate the lost profit from lost business.
Commonly, managers of service systems in which the timing of customer
demands for service is random and cyclic adjust staffing levels in order to provide a
fixed level of service at all times. Examples include staffing of toll plazas (Edie,
1954), airline ground services (Stern and Hersh, 1980; Holloran and Byrne, 1986;
Brusco et al., 1995), tele-retailing (Andrews and Parsons, 1989), and banking
(Brewton, 1989). In applications described in the literature, these staffing policies
are typically determined by first dividing the workdays into “planning periods,”such
the total number of balking customers is 112 and reneging customers is 95. The
balking probability is about (112/1424) = 0.079 = 7.9% and the reneging probability
is about (95/1424) = 0.067 = 6.7%. Thus, the formulating of balking probability and
reneging probability is needed to estimate the amount of lost business and evaluate
the service configuration.
Recently, firms increase using contingent workforce in their service system,
especially for the low-skilled required positions. In order to operate with minimum
total cost, service cost plus waiting cost (balking loss and reneging loss), managers
need to allocate appropriate contingent workforce for different periods that have
cyclic demands. If you add more servers in the service systems, of course, the
average queue length and waiting time will reduce, that is, the balking loss and
reneging loss will reduce, but the service cost will increase. Contrarily, if you use
fewer servers in service systems, you can reduce the service cost, but the balking loss
and reneging loss will increase. Therefore, in order to approach the optimal number
of servers by minimizing total cost , the data in Table 1 and the SIPP
M/M/S:(FCFS/∞/∞) queuing model are utilized for analyzing.

2. Formulate balking loss and reneging loss
Balking is the act of not joining a queue because the prospective arriving
customer judges the queue to be too long. (Jones, 1999) Hence, it is reasonable to
assume the probability of balking is equal to Lqθ1, where Lq is the expected queue
length (excludes customers being served), and θ1 is the balking index. θ1 is the
reneging loss can be formulated as
reneging loss = R(Wq,θ2,λ)AR = Wqθ2λAR (2)
In practice, it is not too hard to estimate the mean purchase amount and the mean
net profit rate, but managers may have trouble to estimate balking index and reneging
index. However, we can collect data by directly observing and use these data to
estimate balking index and reneging index. From Table 1, most of the balking and
reneging customers are in those peak hours, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, and 19-20.
Hence, managers can use the data of these four periods to estimate the balking index
and reneging index of this restaurant. In Table 2, Lq can be estimated from data, then
according to B(Lq, θ1, λ) = Lqθ1 λ, manager can calculate θ1 for each period, for
instance, in planning period 11-12, 21 = 15.1θ1220, and then θ1 = 21/(15.1220) =
0.0063. By the same approach, theθ1 for the other time periods can be estimated in
the same way, and the average θ1 for these four time periods is 0.0081. In addition,
Wq can also be estimated from data, then according to R(Wq, θ2, λ) = Wqθ2 λ,
manager can calculateθ2 for each period, for instance, in planning period 11-12, 20 =
4.15θ2220, and then θ2 = 20/(4.15220) = 0.0219. By the same approach, the θ2
for the other time periods can be estimated in the same way, and the average θ2 for
these four time periods is 0.022. With those estimated parameters, θ1, θ2, λ, A, R, μ,
and K, the optimal number of servers can be approached, whereμis the mean service
rate per server in that planning period, and K is the cost of hiring one server for one
planning period.

3. SIPP M/M/S: (FCFS/∞/∞) model
The (M/M/S):(FCFS/∞/∞) queuing model assumes that all interarrival times are
independently and identically distributed according to an exponential distribution, that
all service times are independent and identically distributed according to another
exponential distribution, that the number of servers is S (any positive integer), that all
(9)
According to equation (8)
K(S+1) + (Lq(S+1)θ1 + Wq(S+1)θ2 )λAR ≧ KS + (Lq(S)θ1 + Wq(S)θ2)λAR,
thus
K/(λAR) ≧ (Lq(S) -Lq(S+1))θ1 + (Wq(S) -Wq(S+1))θ2. (10)
Therefore, combining (9) and (10), we have
(Lq(S) -Lq(S+1))θ1 + (Wq(S) -Wq(S+1))θ2≦ K/(λAR)≦ (Lq(S-1) - Lq(S))θ1 + (Wq(S-1) - Wq(S))θ2.
(11)
By taking advantage of the equations, (3), (4), (5), and (11), each planning period
can be independently solved for the optimal number of servers. Hence, fast food
restaurants can achieve minimum total cost. In this research, Mathematica 5.1
software is used to approach the optimal number of servers.
4. Approaching the optimal number of servers
From Table 1, the number of customers between 7pm and 8pm is 147, λ= 147,
and the mean service rate per server for this fast food restaurant is estimated to be 40
customers/hour, μ= 40, the cost per server per hour is 90 dollars (through out this
paper, all the dollars is New Taiwan Dollars, NTD), K = 90, from Table 2, the balking
index is estimated to be 0.0081, θ1 = 0.0081 (that is, if Lq = 1, the probability of
balking = 0.0081, Lq = 2, the probability of balking = 20.0081 = 0.0162, and so on),
the mean purchase amount of customers is estimated to be 100 dollars, A=100, and
the mean net profit rate of this restaurant is estimated to be 0.5, R = 0.5. From Table
3, if a manager hires four servers for this planning period, according to equations (3)
and (4), Lq = 9.34, that is, the balking probability of those 147 customers is equal to Lq
θ1 = 9.34 0.0081 = 0.0757 = 7.57%, this means about 7.57% of those 147
customers will balk, therefore the number of balking customers, B(Lq,θ1, λ) = Lqθ1
λ, is equal to 0.0757 147 = 11.13 which indicates about 11 customers will balk.
Therefore, balking loss equals to B(Lq, θ1, λ) A R = 11.13 100 0.5 = 557.
Moreover, from Table 2, the reneging index is estimated to be 0.022,θ2 = 0.022 (that
is, if Wq = 1, the probability of reneging = 0.022, Wq = 2, the probability of reneging =
20.022 = 0.044, and so on). From Table 3, if a manager hires four servers for this
planning period, according to equation (5), Wq = 3.81minutes, that is, the reneging
probability of those 147 customers is equal to Wq θ2 = 3.81 0.022 = 0.0838 =
8.38%, this means about 8.38% of those 147 customers will renege, therefore the
number of reneging customers, R(Wq,θ2,λ) = Wq θ2λ, is equal to 0.0838147 =
12.32 which indicates about 12 customers will renege. Therefore, reneging loss
equals to R(Wq,θ2,λ)AR = 12.321000.5 = 616, service cost = KS = 904 =
360, and the total cost = service cost + balking loss + reneging loss = 360 + 557 + 616
rising.
As a result, from Table 3 and Fig. 1, the service cost is increasing from S = 4 to S
= 9, but the balking loss and reneging loss are decreasing. The total cost is
decreasing from S = 4 to S = 6 and increasing from S = 6 to 9, thus S = 6 gives the
optimal number of servers of this planning period. Therefore, using 6 servers
instead of using 3 servers in the period 19-20 of Table 1, the restaurant can save [3 
90 + (11 + 7)1000.5]–583 = 587 dollars.

5. Conclusions
This research is focus on formulating balking loss and reneging loss as waiting
cost, and on using this concept to find the optimal number of servers of each planning
period for queuing systems with varying demands by minimizing the total cost which
includes the service cost, the reneging loss, and the balking loss. One example data
was used to test the practicality and the benefit of using this optimal staffing policy,
and the result shows that this approach is not only innovative but effective tool to aid
managers to determine the optimal number of servers for each planning period of the
time-varying demands queuing systems. By using this approach, restaurants can
benefit from minimizing the total cost to increase the return on invested capital,
enhancing the loyalty of customers to reduce the customer defection rate. The
benefit of customers is that they do not need to stay a long time in the waiting line.
Moreover, utilizing this optimal staffing policy, firms can build their competitive
advantages in such a dramatically competing industry.
The lost profit from lost business is quite difficult to estimate. Therefore, the
most significant contribution of this work is that the balking probability is defined as
