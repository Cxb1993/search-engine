Timing-Driven X-Architecture Routing Tree Construction 
Among Rectangular and Non-Rectangular Obstacles 
  
 
 
 
Abstract—In this paper, we formulate a new X-architecture routing problem in 
presence of non-rectangular obstacles, and propose an X-architecture 
timing-driven routing algorithm to minimize the maximum source-to-sink delay 
and the total wirelength simultaneously. First, a spanning graph is constructed 
by the terminals and the corners of the obstacles. A minimal spanning tree is 
then produced by performing searching algorithm to the spanning graph. The 
feasible X-architecture is constructed by transforming all slant edges of the 
minimal spanning tree. For the initial X-architecture routing tree, the delay of 
source-to-terminal is estimated by the modified Elmore delay model. According 
to the user defined delay threshold, an efficient rerouting algorithm is used to fix 
the timing violated nets. The critical terminals iteratively are rerouted by 
splitting two sub-trees and merging into one tree. Compared to the routing 
result without rerouting, the maximum source-to-sink delay is improved by 
49.1% and only 2.5% of additional total wirelength is increased.

and merges two sub-trees, is proposed to enhance 
the timing of the violated terminals. Experimental 
results indicate that if the initial routing tree is not 
optimal, then the rerouting not only minimizes the 
delay but also reduces the wire length.

superimposing a bounding rectangle for the non- 
rectangular obstacles. The concept of virtual nodes

extension is shown to reveal that the method 
handles obstacles with any geometric shapes.   
  The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section

2 Preliminary 
This section describes the motivation and the novel 
concept for non-rectangular obstacle. Finally, the 
TNOA-XSMT problems are formulated. 
 
2.1 Motivation 
Fig. 1 illustrates that the short wire length is 
obtained by the modern router, which can handle the 
routing with the non-rectangular obstacles. To the 
best of our knowledge, no routers for 
X-architectures have yet been reported in the 
literature. For the Fig. 1(a), the traditional router, 
which treats a non-rectangular obstacle as a 
rectangular obstacle, has the results in Fig. 1(b) but 
the total wire length is long. However, the short total 
wirelength in Fig. 1(c) is obtained by the modern 
router which can handle routing with 
non-rectangular obstacles.  We observe that the 
algorithm can handle the routing with 
non-rectangular are necessary.   
     Besides, we consider the terminals inside the 
virtual obstacle which is the minimal bounding box 
superimposing the non-rectangular obstacles (Fig. 
2(a)). If we only take the corner points of the virtual 
obstacles into the spanning graph construction, we 
have the long wire length (Fig. 2(b)). However, the 
short wire length is obtained in Fig. 2(c). Two 
observations motivate us to develop the modern 
X-architecture router to handle the timing-driven 
routing with the non-rectangular obstacles. 
 
2.2 Frame-based Transformation and 
A-Shaped Pattern Routing 
To simplify, the frame-based transformation which 
finds the minimum bounding box containing the non- 
rectangular obstacle (Fig. 3(a)), is proposed to 
transform the non-rectangular obstacles into the virtual 
obstacles in Fig. 3(b). Because the X-based routing is 
used in the paper, only the isosceles right triangle is 
listed in the experimental results. In fact, the concept is 
suite for not only the triangles but also the hexagon, 
octagon, and the polygon. Furthermore, we construct 
the spanning graph for the rectangles, virtual obstacles 
and terminals. How about the terminals inside the 
virtual obstacles?  
     A novel A-shaped pattern routing, which adds 
two projected virtual nodes onto the non-rectangular 
obstacles, is used. First, we construct the spanning 
graph for the terminals inside the virtual obstacles and 
the corner points of the virtual obstacles (see Fig. 3(c)). 
Second, the additional edges, which connect the virtual 
nodes and the corresponding terminals insider the 
virtual obstacles, are added into the spanning graph 
(Fig. 3(d)). Finally, we can construct the better routing 
tree like Fig. 1(c). Generally, if there are v terminals 
inside the obstacles, we need 2v additional points and 
2v edges in the spanning graph. Hence, the A-shaped 
patter routing which needs less memory is efficient.  
 
2.3 Problem Definition 
The similar concept in [11] is used to obtain a timing- 
driven routing tree with the maximum 
source-to-terminal delays ( maxD  for short), and we 
rerouted the critical path which their delays are larger 
than the delay threshold max    thd D r= × , where r is the 
delay ratio. A larger (smaller) ratio denotes looser 
(tighter) timing constraints. After rerouting which an 
edge of the routing tree is removed and then two 
sub-trees are merged, we have the timing-driven 
routing tree. Hence, the problem is defined as follows, 
     Given a set of the rectangular obstacles 
1 2{ , ,b b . . . }mb , the non-rectangular obstacles 
1 2{ , ,o o . . . }wo , and a set of terminals 1 2{ , ,t t . . . }nt with 
the source s  under the user-defined delay threshold 
( thd ), the objective is to construct the X-architecture 
routing tree which minimizes the maxD among obstacles. 
8 
Table 1   Results for the wirelength and timing-driven routing trees. 
 
Second, we investigate the rerouting effect on 
the detour routing, i.e. maxD . Fig. 6 shows the 
rerouting effect on delay, indicating that the detour in 
routing (the red line) is reduced. Because of paper 
limit, Table 1 only shows the result of source type I. 
In fact, our method stably reduced the maxD under 
three source types. If the rerouting does not reduce 
the maxD of the initial tree, the initial result is 
retained.  
 
5 Conclusion  
This study formulates a novel TNOA-XSMT 
problem. Additionally, this work presents an 
effective timing-driven algorithm that minimizes the 
maxD  to construct an X-based routing tree with 
non-rectangular obstacles. Compared with the result 
without rerouting, the experimental results indicate 
that the maxD  with rerouting is improved by 49.1% 
with only 2.5% additional wire length.
