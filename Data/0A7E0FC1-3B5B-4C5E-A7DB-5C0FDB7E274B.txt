 The calcined materials were again ground to -325 BBS mesh. X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) 
analysis was carried out on the calcined (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 powder. CuO-TiO2 mixture with the CuO/ 
TiO2 mole ratio 1 was prepared. 1wt% CuO-TiO2 mixture was added to calcined (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 
powder by wetting mixing. After drying and grinding, the products were pressed into pellets using 
distilled water as binder. The pellets were sintered at temperatures varying 1050 to 1200
o
C, keeping 
the sintering duration fixed for 2h, to study the effect of sintering temperatures on the morphologies 
and bulk densities of CuO-TiO2 mixture fluxed (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics. Bulk densities were 
calculated by using the Archimedes method. The microstructural observations of the surfaces of 
sintered samples were directly observed from the SEM (scanning electronic micrograph). The Ag-Pd 
paste were printed at both side and sintered at 700
o
C for 15min. The dielectric properties of 
(Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics were measured at 1MHz with Agilent-4294A impedance analyzer.

Results and Discussion 
For (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics without CuO-TiO2 mixture addition, the grain growth is found to be 
negligible even 1300
o
C is used as sintering temperature (not shown here). Fig.1 shows the 
photomicrographs of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics with 1wt% CuO-TiO2 mixture addition and fired at 
different temperature. Sintered at 1100
o
C, as Fig.1(a) shows, the grain growth is not found and the 
sintered (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics show a porous morphologies. Sintering at 1150
o
C, the BaTiO3 and 
(Ba0.8Sr0.2)TiO3 ceramics reveal a densified and uniform-grain-growth surface, as shown Fig.1(b) (20 
~110µm) and 1(c) (10 ~40µm). As Figs.1(b)~1(c) are compared, it is found that the grain sizes of 
(Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics decrease with the increase of SrO content. The sintered morphologies prove 
that CuO-TiO2 mixture can be used as a sintering aid and improve the grain grow of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 
ceramics. Fig.1 also suggests that the sintering and dielectric characteristics of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 
ceramics will have large variation as the sintering temperature changes from 1100
o
C to 1150
o
C. 
Fig.2 show the X-ray diffraction patterns of calcined powders and CuO-TiO2-fluxed (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 
ceramics. For calcined powders and 1050
o
C-sintered ceramics, only the (2,0,0) plane of BaTiO3 
composition shows an apparent splitting and the (2,0,0) plane of (Ba0.9Sr0.1)TiO3 and (Ba0.8Sr0.2)TiO3 
compositions shows an unapparent splitting. Sintered at 1150
o
C, the splitting in (2,0,0) and (2,1,0) 
planes are observed and (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics reveal a tetragonal phase. The 2θ values of 
(Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics are shifted to higher values as the SrO content increases, this result suggests 
that the lattice constants of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics will decrease with the increase of SrO content. 
The bulk densities of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics are presented in Fig.3 as a function of SrO content 
and sintering temperature. The unfluxed (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics will be densified at about 
1400
o
C~1450
o
C, and the bulk densities of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics are about 94% the theoretical 
density of (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics (not shown here). The densification curves of CuO-TiO2 mixture 
fluxed (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics are shifted about 300
o
C lower than those of unfluxed (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 
ceramics. The CuO-TiO2 mixture fluxed (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 ceramics start to densify at around 1050
o
C.
