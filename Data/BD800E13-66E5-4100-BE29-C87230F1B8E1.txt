英文摘要: A well known problem associated with the diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is 
that reconstructed optical-property images suffer from low spatial resolution due to the 
diffusive nature of light.  An iterative solution to the optimization problem was developed 
using Tikhonov regularization with optimal constraints regarding as a prior knowledge into 
the objective function.  In this study, we focused on the edge-preserving constraint in the 
objective function and half-quadratic regularization was introduced in the minimization task 
to seek the estimate of reconstructed optical-property images.

1. Introduction 前言 
Optical tomography is in an attempt to image interior human tissues such as brain, breasts, etc., acting as 
non-destruction biopsy.  A well known problem associated with the tomography reconstruction of the near 
infra-red (NIR) imaging system is the introduction of blurring effect and artifacts into a reconstructed 
optical-property image due to the diffusive nature of the light scattered by the biological tissues.  For the 
purpose of remedying these defects to improve the reconstructed image quality, image reconstruction 
regularized with constraints is an alternative rather than that using the structural information incorporated into 
an initial guess.   
As known, image reconstruction (the inverse solution) for DOT is an ill-posed problem [1]. Tikhonov 
regularization is a method of incorporating a priori assumptions or constraints about the desired solution, 
which converts an ill-posed problem into a well-posed problem. For available constraints, several factors are 
usually considered as listed below. It is expected that a reconstructed optical-property image should exhibit 
the following characteristics which are (1) positive, (2) spatially smooth, (3) edge preserved and (4) 
convergent but not (5) band limit and (6) sensitive to noise, and so on.  
Several studies [2-7] have been realized using structural prior information as the constraint in the objective 
function.  To the end of obtaining better and reasonable images, we derive a finite element method (FEM) 
based image reconstruction from maximizing the likelihood or minimizing the least squared error combined 
with the above described constraints.  Therefore, an iterative solution to the optimization problem is 
developed using the Tikhonov regularization with the optimal constraints regarding as a prior knowledge into 
the objective function. In this study, we focus on the edge-preserving constraint in the objective function and

In order to simplify the minimization task, half-quadratic regularization [8, 11] was introduced; the 
principle is to introduce a set of auxiliary variables, b = ( bh, bv, bd1, bd2 ), to make the manipulation of the 
MAP criterion easier.

For the reconstruction of the optical-property images by iteratively updating Δχ, minimizing the MAP
 energy Q(Δχ) in Δχ is equivalent to minimizing Q*(Δχ, b) in (Δχ, b).   An algorithm to estimate Δ
χ is based on alternate minimizations over Δχ and b as follows, i.e.

These equations can be solved iteratively, starting each step from the estimated image of previous step.  
Here, we use a generalized Lorentzian function in replace of φ’(t)/2t of three edge-preserving potential

As can be seen, Eq.(11) is equal to the use in [8] when γ=1 and m=2, 1, 0.5, and is also a Lorentzian function 
when m=1.  The use of the generalized Lorentzian function is for its adaptive characteristics.  Figure 1 
illustrates the procedure of FEM-based image reconstruction in the DC domain.  As indicated, the 
edge-preserving constraint approach is implemented without altering the original FEM-modeling too much.

1. Introduction 
Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) uses the non-radioactive light in the near infrared range to image the human 
body non-invasively and has ability to quantify the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin which can be used to 
target the physiological function of tumors. Therefore, DOT becomes a promising diagnostic tool for cancer 
detection. Due to the diffuse nature of light when photons transporting through the highly scattering medium such as 
tissues, the image reconstruction problems in DOT are usually ill-posed and ill-conditioned [1], and must be 
regularized or added the structural prior information in order to obtain the convinced results [2-9]. The method of 
Tikhonov regularization for stabilizing the solution of image reconstruction is usually adopted in DOT and often 
results in blur images. In this study, we present the use of edge preserving regularization as a priori information in 
the reconstruction procedure for DOT to prevent unwanted edge smoothing, which degrades the attributes of images 
for distinguishing tumors from background tissues. In the proposed regularization method a potential function with 
edge preserving properties is introduced as a regularized term in an objective function. With the purpose of 
minimization of this objective function, an iterative method to solve this optimization problem is presented. The 
frequency-domain simulated data are employed to justify the proposed technique. The reconstruction results indicate 
that the edge preserving regularization provides evident improvement over the standard Tikhonov regularization. 
2. Method 
In edge-preserving regularization, we consider the inverse problem in DOT as a damped least squares problem in 
which the objective function is

where the index k  is in the lexicographical order, the index l  may represent the horizontal, vertical or diagonal 
direction, and   is the regularization parameter that balances the first, data term, and the second, a regularization or 
a priori term, on the right-hand side of equation (1).   is known as the potential function in the Bayesian 
framework. It determines the regularization imposed on every value of the first-order difference lD χ , which is 
used to detect the discontinuities of the update vector χ  in specific direction l . In order to preserve edges,   is 
required to satisfy three conditions [10]: (1) ( ) 2t t  is continuous and strictly decreasing on [0, ) , (2)

Suppose that ( )EpQ χ  has a minimum in χ , then we have necessarily condition that the derivative of

where weightedΔ  is a matrix that represents a weighted discrete approximation of the Laplacian operator. The matrix-
vector multiplication weightedΔ χ  is equivalent to a non-stationary filtering of χ  by a weighted Laplcian filter.
