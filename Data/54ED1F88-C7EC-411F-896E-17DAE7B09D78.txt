and experiments. For the first subproject, we 
have completed a spectrum auction platform for 
hierarchical package bidding (HPB) as well as a 
detailed model for femtocell-based MVNO. In 
the second subproject, we have successfully 
transformed the NP-hard integer programming

globally optimal objective values. The third 
subproject investigated the short-interval 
secondary spectrum market and designed the

spectrum auction (SISA) platform according to 
the analysis results. The subproject also 
established integrated decision model of pricing 
and channel allocation, developed solution 
method and analyzed strategies of integrated 
pricing and channel allocation for MNO. The 
fourth subproject focused on the VCG auction 
design and has completed 16 sessions of 
experiments with 96 subjects participating in 
201 auctions. We believe the outcome of this 
project, including its models, analysis 
approaches, results, and the human-machine 
hybrid simulation platform can become a set of 
valuable decision-supporting tools for both the 
government and the wireless industry.

2. Research Progress of the Subprojects 
2.1. Performance Analysis and Simulation of 
Coordinated Spectrum Sharing 
Mechanism between Large Scale 
Wireless Network and MVNOs 
2.1.1. Introduction 
In the research of efficient allocation and 
sharing of the wireless spectrum, we start by 
modeling the auction of the spectrum licenses 
and developing its auction platform. Via the 
development of the business evolution model 
which helps the valuation of the spectrum, and 
the actual implementation of the radio spectrum 
auction platform, one can simulate various 
scenarios of spectrum license auctions and 
provide an advanced impact analysis of possible 
auction outcome. Based on these tools, we will 
be able to design short-term or fast spectrum 
auction mechanisms, and the wireless resources 
can be shared or allocated more efficiently. In 
addition, higher license fee via the spectrum 
auction can also be collected, and the 
government/regulator can have much better 
understanding of the impact of auction results 
on the evolution of cellular market. 
In the second year of this project, we have 
completed a spectrum auction platform 
implementing the hierarchical package bidding 
algorithm (HPB)[1]. The bidders can bid on any 
combination of the frequency bands in this 
platform and the server software will decide the 
winner according to the rules defined by HPB. 
In addition, we also develop a femtocell-based 
MVNO model which illustrates the scenario 
that an MVNO can make agreement with the 
MNO and extend its service by deploying 
femtocells. In next step, the auction platform 
will be ported to a cloud computing architecture, 
and an evaluation tool based on the developed 
business evolution model of both MNO and 
MVNO will be incorporated. 
2.1.2. Auction Platform 
We have developed the spectrum auction 
platform based on the hierarchical package 
bidding (HPB) [1][2] algorithm. This platform 
enables the auctioneer to hold an auction 
according to the HPB architecture, which allows 
the bidders bid for any combination of the 
frequency bands.  
2.1.2.1 HPB algorithm 
The fundamental concept of the HPB 
algorithm is briefly described as follows.  
If the sum of separate spectrums is greater 
than a single combinative spectrum, the winning 
bid and winners of separate spectrums are equal 
to their highest bid respectively and 
corresponding winners, the winning bid of 
combinative spectrums are equal to the sum of 
the highest bids of separate spectrum without a 
winner. 
Otherwise, if the sum of separate spectrums 
is less than a single combinative spectrum, the 
winning bid and winner of the single 
combinative spectrums are equal to the highest 
bids of combinative spectrum and 
corresponding winner, the winning bid of 
separate spectrums are equal to their highest bid 
added by the respective tax without winners 
respectively.  
2.1.2.2 Software Implementation 
Our spectrum auction platform is 
implemented using Flash, PHP, MySQL, and 
6 
We consider a model of a single macro BS 
with coverage radius Rm, and there are totally 
Nfc femto BS deployed in this area. Since 
co-channel operation of the femto BS is 
presumed, their coverage radius rf will depend 
on their transmit power Pf and the intensity of 
the interferences. As a result, the transmit power 
of the macro BS Pm and the distance between 
the macro and femto BS dfm will affect the value 
of rf. In addition, path loss models are also 
essential to the calculation of rf and the 
achievable air interface data rates of the BS. As 
in [4], we adopt the widely accepted ITU-R 
P.1411 [5] and P.1238 [6] models for the 
outdoor and indoor path losses. 
It is assumed that there are Nf licensed 
femto users in each femtocell and each femto 
user will access the network with probability q. 
In order to prevent excessive roaming macro 
users from abusing the resources of the 
femtocells, there is an upper limit Nr on the 
number of simultaneous roaming users in each 
femtocell. 
The mobility pattern of the macro users is 
assumed to be nomadic. The locations of the 
connecting macro users and the femto BS are 
presumably distributed as Spatial Poisson Point 
Processes (SPPP) in the macrocell. However, 
due to the higher achievable capacity of the 
femtocells, we assume that there will be an 
“absorbing effect” if the locations of the 
femtocells are advertised and known to the 
macro users. That is to say, the macro users may 
become willing to move to the vicinity of a 
nearby femtocell within certain range in order to 
obtain better data throughput. We model this 
effect by multiplying the arrival rates in the 
femtocell coverage by an “absorbing factor” α. 
The transmit power Pf of the femto BS is a 
key parameter for the MVNO for network 
design and performance tuning. Since the femto 
BS could be deployed at any location and might 
probably be moved to other places by the 
subscribers, we assume that the MVNO can 
only design a single Pf value optimized for any 
possible location of deployment in this model. 
The objective of the optimization of Pf is to 
maximize the expected utility of the femto users. 
Nevertheless, the macro users will also react to 
the resulted transmission range and data rate of 
the femtocells and adjust the degree of their 
absorbing behavior to maximize their utility. 
Therefore, it constitutes a two-sided 
optimization problem and can be solved via 
game theoretic technique. 
2.1.3.2 User Utilities 
The idea of the utility functions originates 
from the study of the economics and has been 
applied to represent the satisfaction of the 
subscribers to network or telecommunication 
services in the literature [11][12]. In this work, 
the well-known Sigmoid function is adopted to 
quantify the users' utility with respect to the 
received quality of service (QoS), e.g. the 
throughput and/or the blocking probability. 
For femto users, the only QoS metric 
considered is the received data rate bf and thus 
the utility function is given as 
 
( )
1( ) ,
1 f f ff f b
u b
e
ζ β −=
+
 ( 1 ) 
where βf corresponds to the data rate at which 
the utility of the femto users is 0.5, and ζf is a 
parameter that controls the shape (slope) of the 
function. 
On the other hand, the utility function of 
8 
Bm(Pf) and Bf (α) is done by finding the ridges 
in the 3D plot of Uf and Um then acquiring the 
projection of the ridges on the Pf-α plane 
respectively. Thus, the Nash equilibrium of this 
setting can be acquired by computing the 
intersection of these two curves.

Maximum transmit power of femto BS

We compare the performance results of the  
NE solutions to those of the scheme that the 
MVNO optimizes Pf without considering the 
absorbing effect. We compute the minimum 
number of femtocells required in a macrocell to 
maintain the blocking probability 0.05bmp ≤  
and the total interference power produced by 
these femtocells (see TABLE 1). In this case, 
the optimal solution of the single side 
optimization (Opt. Pf) is always setting the 
transmit power to the maximum value 21dBm. 
This is due to the low arrival rate of the roaming 
users if the absorbing effect is not taken into 
account, and the best policy for maximizing the 
Uf is increasing Pf to achieve higher throughput. 
For comparison, if there is no femtocell 
deployment, the blocking probability would be 
0.53 and the expected throughput of the macro 
user is as low as 0.14 even when λtot = 2 
(1/min.). From TABLE 2, it is obvious that the 
NE solutions significantly reduce the intensity 
and range of the interferences while providing a 
similar level of QoS. According to the 
discussions in [7] and [8], excessive transmit 
power of the femto BS would lead to high call 
drop probability and can increase the amount of 
mobility signaling in the core network. As a 
result, adopting the NE solutions not only saves 
power, but also makes the MVNO more 
welcome to the MNO who leases the usage of 
the frequency band.

The surrogate duality gap is adopted in the interior 
point DSA optimization to choose the approximation 
parameter t  and to decide the termination 
condition. 
In summary, the interior point DSA optimization 
algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. 
2.2.3 Simulation Results and Discussion 
The simulation environment is an L L×  2m  
square region.  There is a PR base station locating 
at the center of the region.  All other PUs and CR 
transmitters are randomly deployed.  Each CR 
receiver locates 10 to 20 m to the corresponding 
transmitter in each coordinate.  TABLE 4 
summarizes the other simulation parameters. 
TABLE 4.  Simulation parameters. 
 
When considering the utility function, we adopt 
the bit error rate (BER) calculation from the IEEE 
802.15.2-2003 standard [27]. 
We compare the proposed DSA optimization 
method with three other solutions of the DSA 
problem in CRNs.  The first solution is proposed 
by Shu and Krunz in [16].  This would be denoted 
as BLP in this report, which uses a discrete 
approximation technique to transform the MINLP 
problem to a BLP problem.  In our simulation, the 
number of discrete approximation is set as 11.  The 
second and the third solutions are proposed by 
Hoang et al. in [19].  They would be denoted as 
MDCA-MM and MDCA-SM, respectively, where 
MM denotes maximum matching, and SM denotes 
simple matching.  In MDCA-SM, a secondary user 
randomly selects a channel from its candidates.

Fig.5 Aggregated throughput vs. number of 
channels. Length of simulation area is 200 m. 
The number of secondary users is set as 5. 
We fix L  as 200m  and N  as 5 .  Fig.5  
shows the aggregated throughput with different 
number of channels.  This figure shows that the 
proposed method always performs the best.  
MDCA-MM performs a little better than 
MDCA-SM does, since MDCA-MM tries to find a 
solution with maximum weights.  However, they 
both get poor performance in the simulations.  The 
reason of the poor performance is that MDCA-MM 
and MDCA-SM could only assign any channel to 
one SU, and each SU could only use at most one 
channel.  Therefore, these two algorithms could not 
benefit from using multiple channels, and their 
performance is limited.  BLP performs better than 
MDCA-MM and MDCA-SM do.  However, its 
performance is limited by the discrete 
approximation which loses many feasible solutions.  
The performance of the proposed method increases 
as the number of channels increases.  Although 
increasing the number of channels also means 
increasing the number of PUs, and thus the 
14 
secondary spectrum market, a single round, 
sealed bid auction is chosen for detailed design. 
It is aimed to allocate channels efficiently, and 
reflect the value of the channels according to 
the requirements of MVNOs. The spectrum 
broker is also the auctioneer who coordinates 
the auction procedure. In the auction as shown 
in Figure 9, the auctioneer selects winning bids 
by solving a Knapsack problem that maximizes 
bid price combination. The winners settle the 
payment according to a second price scheme of 
multiple objects. In making bid offer decision, 
individual MVNOs estimate the number of 
demand channels based on their respective 
customer service demands. MVNOs calculate 
the channel values according to the expected 
revenue, running cost, expected profit rate and 
customer service dissatisfaction.  
2.3.3 Analysis Findings 
Comparisons are performed beween 
pay-as-bid and VCG auction schemes (Table 7).  
Analyses of the VCG auction model under 
different bidding attitude lead to the following 
findings: 
(1) MVNOs offering bids based on their true 
valuation of channels is the optimal bidding 
strategy.  
(2) MVNOs bidding aggressively wins a higher 
percentage of supply channels than bidding 
conservatively. 
(3) The MNO needs to set a reserve price for the 
channels. 
(4) The second-price settlement rule suits an 
intensely competitive market. 
2.3.4 Short-Interval Spectrum Auction (SISA) 
Platform  
We also designed and implemented the 
auction mechanism on a short-interval spectrum 
auction (SISA) platform as depicted in Figure 
10, which adopts Flash CS4 for interface design, 
MySQL 4.0.24 as the database, Apache 1.3.33 
as the web server, and PHP for the server-side 
programming language. The platform is 
applicable to three MVNO bidding decision 
modes: automatic, manual, and supervised 
(Figures 11).

that a specific type of MVNO will choose the 
pair whose corresponding utility value is closest 
to the value in the original function. The MNO 
will announce the optimal price schedule to the 
MVNOs. All MVNOs are assumed to be 
rational so that each MVNO will select the 
quantity-price pair from the price schedule 
designed for its type. 
2.4.2 Related Work 
In the past, a number of system models 
have been proposed for bandwidth allocation 
and pricing in wireless environments. They 
address the problem by considering a different 
mix of the players of service providers, 
customers, and government. Various methods 
such as auction [37][38][39], game theory 
[36][40][41], or economic analysis [42][43] are 
used to tackle the problem. In these works, 
service providers are modeled by using some 
simple parameters such as maximum budget or 
maximum amount of money willing to pay for a 
certain bandwidth amount. In our work, we 
model the behavior of an MVNO by demand 
curve and acceptance function to capture the 
essential factors of a service provider in service 
provisioning. The demand curve describes an 
MVNO’s willingness to pay (W2P) for the 
bandwidth. It shows the dollar value the MVNO 
attaches to the bandwidth resource. It gives the 
relationship of the willingness to pay for one 
more units of bandwidth and the dollar measure 
of the benefits the extra unit of the bandwidth 
brought to the MVNO. The term "willingness to 
pay" also implies "marginal benefit" to the 
MVNO. The utility function is used as a 
mechanism to measure an MVNO’s satisfaction 
of MNO’s offer in response to its demand in 
dynamic bandwidth trading. 
Among all the methods used in spectrum 
management, auction has been the most 
popularly used method. In [37], they consider a 
spectrum manager (e.g., the government) that 
periodically auctions short-term spectrum 
licenses to multiple CDMA network operators. 
They consider the goal of the operators is to 
find maximum revenue. Therefore, each 
operator determines its own pricing based on its 
users’ willingness to pay in bidding. In [38], 
two auction mechanisms are proposed for 
spectrum sharing between a number of users 
according to signal to interference-plus-noise 
ratio (SINR) and received power. In [39], a 
spectrum auction framework is presented which 
formulates a conflict-free spectrum allocation 
between users as an optimization problem. They 
also discuss the tradeoffs between auctioneer’s 
revenue and the fairness to the users under 
different pricing strategy (such as uniform or 
discriminatory pricing). The main drawback of 
auction is that it is time-consuming and may 
incur high operation cost. It is also known for 
its unfavorable of spectrum utilization. Namely, 
it is possible that some operators may not fully 
utilize the fixed amount of spectrum band from 
bidding in its lease term. Indeed, such a 
problem has been well recognized. The new 
emerging topics of cognitive radio and dynamic 
spectrum allocation are targeting on these 
problems [40]. In this paper, we assume that a 
spectrum owner (MNO) will take its unused 
bandwidth to open market for trading. Any 
interested MVNOs could buy bandwidth from 
the MNO to meet their service needs and goals. 
The open bandwidth trading and allocation will 
be an iterative process rather than a one-time 
20 
2.4.3 System Model 
In this work, we use a non-linear price schedule 
to discriminate among different types of 
MVNOs – the potential buyers of the unused 
bandwidth supplied by the MNO. The price 
schedule is in a form of pairs of bandwidth 
quantity and the price designed for each 
different MVNO type. In the proposed model 
there are two roles of players, the buyers 
(multiple MVNOs) and the seller (one MNO). 
The MNO owns only one single product, 
bandwidth, with constant marginal cost c 1 
which will publish a price schedule for 
MVNOs’ choice. Based on the type of the 
MVNOs, each MVNO will select the 
bandwidth-price pair that is suitable for it. 
2.4.3.1 MVNO: the Buyer 
We assume that MVNOs are of types. Here 
we use parameter θ to describe the MVNO type; 
θ is bounded by [θL, θU]. A type θ MVNO has 
preference represented by the utility function 
which follows the standard consumer surplus 
approach: 
TdxxpTbU
b
−= ∫0 );();,( θθ              (1) 
where b is the quantity purchased, T is the total 
price paid and p(x; θ) is the demand price 
function of type θ MVNO. The demand price 
function p(x; θ) represents the dollar value the 
type θ MVNO attaches to the bandwidth 
resource. It states the price that the MVNO is 
willing to pay for one more unit of bandwidth.2 
                                                 
1
 In economics and finance, marginal cost is the change 
in total cost that arises when the quantity produced 
changes by one unit. The constant marginal cost simply 
the problem. 
2
 In the real world the unit is usually in discrete format 
while the function is continuous. 
The integration of the demand price function 
gives the total willingness to pay for the total 
amount of b units of bandwidth. We assume 
there exists an efficient consumption level for 
which demand price exceeds marginal cost for 
type θ, denoted by be(θ). Two assumptions are 
made for the demand price function. 
Assumption 1. For all feasible θ, (1) the 
demand price function p(b; θ) is 
non-increasing in b and non-negative3; 
(2) be(θ)≧ 0 and p(b; θ) is decreasing in 
b for b ≦ be(θ), and p(b; θ)≧ c if and 
only if b ≦ be(θ); and (3) p(b; θ) is 
twice continuously differentiable. 
Assumption 2. Higher levels of θ are 
associated with a higher demand. That is, 
p(b; θ) is strictly increasing in θ 
whenever p(b; θ) is positive. 
Hence, the differences in MVNOs are 
modeled by the parameter θ.For a specific qua 
tity of bandwidth, if θa < θb, a type θb MVNO is 
willing to pay more than type θa MVNO in 
obtaining extra unit of bandwidth.  
We assume MVNO uses the utility 
function to measure and evaluate the price 
schedule of bandwidth leasing service from the 
MNO. Each type of MVNO is assumed to 
choose the quantity-price pair that will 
maximize its utility. If there are more than one 
pairs of choice giving the same maximal utility, 
the MVNO is assumed to choose the one with 
the greatest amount of bandwidth.  
Here, it is assumed that the MVNOs follow 
a continuous distribution represented by the 
cumulative distribution function (CDF) F(θ) 
and the probability density function f(θ). F(θ) is

 The non-increasing property might not be suitable for 
scarce resources. Although the spectrum is scarce, we still 
assume this property in our work. 
22 
constraints in finding the optimal price schedule. 
The self-selection constraints are that each 
MVNO type be as happy with the quantity-price 
pair assigned to it in the optimal price schedule 
as with that of any other type. In other words, 
for each type, only one of the constraints is 
actually binding. This is also called the "local 
downward" constraint. For example, suppose 
that there are n different types. Because we have 
assumed that the indifference curves 
(return-quantity of purchase curve) of an 
individual MVNO with a higher type are 
everywhere steeper (according to Assumptions 
1 and 2). In the schedule of the quantity-price 
pairs optimal for each buyer type, if the pair is 
optimal for lowest type, then all other pair 
offers must lie on or above the indifference 
curve for the type through the optimal pair for 
this type. That is, a type i MVNO will not 
switch to a lower level of bandwidth 
quantity-price offer. No higher type MVNO will 
do so either. Thus the function b(θ) is a 
non-decreasing function.  
Furthermore, in Assumption 3, we assume 
F(θ) is a strictly increasing, continuously 
differentiable function on the interval [θL, θU] 
with F(θL) = 1 - F(θU) = 0. With (q(θ), p(θ)> 
optimal for each type θ MVNO, we can write 
maximized utility as 
)());(()(* θθθθ RbNU −≡
              (7) 
And, according to Assumptions 1 and 2, for 
each type of MVNO, the "local downward" 
constraint is also strictly binding. That is, a type 
θ MVNO obtains no extra surplus by choosing 
the offers for the MVNOs with the lower types 
than θ. Hence, we have

Therefore, the construction of the optimal price 
schedule is divided into two steps. In the first 
step we want to find the optimal bandwidth 
{b*(θ)} that maximizes the expectation of 
return, EQ(11). Then, we will take the optimal 
bandwidth b*(θ) from the first step into EQ(8) 
to compute R*(θ) and then using following 
equation to obtain the optimal price T*(θ).

                (12) 
In the following we will show how to derive the 
optimal price schedule. 
2.4.4.1 Compute Optimal Bandwidth 
Quantity 
To find the maximum expectation of return 
in EQ(11), is to maximize I(b(θ); θ) for all 
feasible θ. In other words, if b*(θ) maximizes 
I((b(θ); θ) for all feasible θ, b*(θ) would also 
maximize the expectation of return. We prove 
the above statement by contradiction. Suppose 
that b*(θ) maximizes I(b(θ); θ) and there exists 
a b**(θ) such that b**(θ) leads to a higher 
expected return than b*(θ). Since b**(θ) leads 
24 
correction of the cumulative distribution 
function is done by iteration of a new price 
schedule announcement and request 
re-submissions from the MVNOs. 
Another important task performed in each 
iteration is to enforce the bandwidth capacity 
constraint. In the initial phase, the optimal price 
schedule is derived with no capacity constraint. 
In the subsequent iterations, we will focus on 
how to assure that the total amount of 
bandwidth MVNOs requested does not exceed 
the bandwidth capacity, denoted by B. We note 
that in each round the MVNOs' responses to the 
optimal price schedule gives the information of 
the possible total bandwidths needed. If the total 
amount does not exceed B, then the iteration of 
the trading process can terminate by the MNO 
accepting all requests from the MVNOs. 
Otherwise, we need to consider how to 
incorporate the capacity constraint into the 
optimal price schedule computation. We take 
the expectation form of the requested amount of 
bandwidth and the capacity constraint can be 
represented as follows:

continuous function. In practice, the price 
schedule is usually given in a simple 
easy-to-read discrete format for the general 
public. Therefore, the translation from the 
continuous optimal price schedule function into 
discrete table is also addressed so to assure that 
a specific type of MVNO will choose the pair 
whose corresponding utility value is closest to 
the value in the original function. Finally an 
example optimal price schedule is given. 
2.5. An Experimental Study of Auction 
Design and Spectrum Trading 
Mechanisms in Telecommunication 
Market 
2.5.1 Guidelines for HPB procedure 
Suppose there are { }IB,...B,BI 21=  
bidders competing for 
{ }1 2, , , JG G G G= K goods in an auction. Let 
{ }SS ,...2,1=  be the set of all possible subset of 
J , so 12 −= JS . In a combinatorial auction, 
bidders could place bid on any one of the 
subsets. We begin with the simplest possible 
case, let 2=J  and the two goods are spectrum 
blocks A and C. So { } AC  C,  A, =S , which 
means that A and C could be sold separately or 
in package AC. For easy of expression, an 
element of S is referred to as an item, A and C 
are singleton items, and AC is a package item. 
The basic principle of the winner 
determination rule in HPB is quite simple, we 
first find the highest bids for A, C and AC, 
which are labeled as HBA, HBC and HBAC. The 
goods will be sold in package only if HBAC 
>HBA+ HBC, that is, only if the government 
could receive more revenues from package AC.  
There are two possible allocation results in 
each round; the goods may be sold separately as 
Single goods, or they could be sold as Package. 
These two allocations are abbreviated as S and 
P respectively. For S allocation, the highest bids 
of A and C would be referred as the provisional 
winning bids PWBA and PWBC. And if the 
allocation is P, the highest bid of package AC is 
recorded as PWBAC. The associated provisional 
winners will be labeled as PWi, i=A, C and AC. 
HPB is a multi-round auction, so we also 
need to specify the bid incremental rule between 
rounds. To calculate the minimum effective bids 
(MEBi), we must consider the possibility the 
there may or may not be new bids for the items 
in round k. If there are no new bids for an item, 
the HB in this round would be zero, so we must 
refer back to the highest bid in the previous 
round, abbreviated as OHBi (old high bid). The 
incremental rule contains two parts:  
 (1). Basic increment I: If there are new bids in 
round k, then the bids in round (k+1) must 
increase by I for singleton, and 2I for package 
AC. But for items with no new bids, we do not 
need to raise the bids by I or 2I in the 
subsequent round.  
(2). Hierarchical differences D: Two sub cases 
must be considered here; that the allocation in 
round k is S or P.  
2.5.1.1 The result of round k is S allocation, so 
HBAC≦HBA+ HBC. Singltons are provisional 
winner, and the provisional winning bids are 
PWBA and PWBC. For the new bids for package 
AC to be effective in round (k+1), it must be 
greater than (PWBA+PWBC).  
2.5.1.2 The result of round k is P allocation, so 
HBAC>HBA+ HBC. Goods are sold in package 
and the provisional winning bid is PWBAC. The 
difference between PWBAC and sum of highest 
28 
4    
5    
6   62 
 
Determining that PWBAC=62 is easy, but 
the calculation of MEBi is more complicated. 
Note that there are new bid for A in round k, 
and a higher HBA causes a decrease in 
hierarchical difference. In round (k-1) it was D 
= 0.5(PWBAC-HBA-HBC) = 0.5(56-22-24) = 5. 
But in round k, D = 0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC) = 
0.5(62-40-24) = -1. It is not reasonable to have 
a negative hierarchical difference, so the 
definition of D should be modified into 
D=max{ 0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC), 0 }.  
But adding this D value to the OHBC 
would result in a smaller MEBC in round k, 
MEBC=OHBC+D+I=24+0+2=26. It seems 
reasonable to require MEBi to be 
non-decreasing. Let MEBi(k-1) refer to the 
minimum efficient bid of item i in round k-1, 
the correct formula should be: MEBC ＝
max{ OHBC + max { 0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC), 
0 }+I, MEBC(k-1)}. Invoking this corrected 
formula for MEB, the HPB program would 
report the round k results as in the following 
table. 
Item PWB PW MEB 
A N/A N/A HBA+D+I=40+0+2=42 
C N/A N/A max { OHBC + D+I, 
MEBC(k-1)}= max {26, 
31}=31 
AC PWBAC=62 PWAC=6 PWBAC + 
2*I=62+2*2=66 
 
Note that in round (k-1), 
MEBA29+MEBC31=MEBAC60. This 
relationship would still hold in round k if we do 
not invoke the nonnegative D and non 
decreasing MEB constraint. Without these 
constraints, the minimum effective bid would be 
calculated as  
MEBA=HBA+0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC)+I=40-1
+2=41,  
MEBC=OHBC+0.5(PWBAC-HBA-OHBC)+I=24-
1+2=25.  
And MEBA41+MEBC25=66, which is exactly 
the value of MEBAC. 
To compare the meaning of the constrained 
MEB and no constrain MEB, let us look into 
some possible new bids in round (k+1). Under 
the no constrain MEB, if the new bids in (k+1) 
round are as in Example 1, the result would be a 
P allocation.  
Example 1 new bids in round (k+1) 
 A C AC 
1 40   
2    
3    
4  26  
5   70 
6    
 
But the constrained MEB raises the MEB for 
singleton, and since effective HBC is higher, it 
means that the threshold for HBAC to be the 
provisional winner will be higher. So the same 
HBAC=70 in Example 2 would not be the 
winning bid.

2.4.3 VCG Experiment Design 
Our experiment involves 6 bidders (firms) 
competing for 3 goods (spectrum blocks), so the 
set X contains 216 possible x allocations. The 
three goods are { }C,B,AG = , and the set of 
subsets is 
{ } { } { } { } { } { } { }{ }ABCBCACABCBAS ,,,,,,= . 
{ }A , { }B , and { }C  are referred to as singleton 
subsets, { }AB , { }AC , and { }BC  dual subsets, 
and { }ABC  grand subset 
Within this structure, there are four 
controls in our research; synergy, industry 
structure, auction rules, and private versus 
common value.  
1. The goods may have positive or negative 
synergy. Positive synergy means the 
value functions are superadditive, for 
example, ( ) ( ) ( )ABvBvAv iii    ≤+  for all 
i. It also means that the goods are 
compliments. Negative synergy means 
the value functions are subadditive, for 
example, ( ) ( ) ( )ABvBvAv iii    ≥+ , and 
the goods are then partially substitutes. 
2. We consider three industry structures. 
The six bidders could all be big firms 
interested in all seven subsets. Or, they 
could be six medium size firms, each 
interested in two singletons and one dual 
subset. And the final case assumes that 
three of the bidders are small firms 
interested in one singleton, the other 
three are big firms interested only in 
obtaining the grand subset.  
3. With exactly the same synergy, industry 
structure and random private values, we 
run the same design twice, once under 
VCG rule and also under the first price

B1 A 
B2 B 
B3 C 
B4, B5, B6 ABC 
 
Our common value environment design 
includes tow level of uncertainty. 
1. CV easy 
Each good has an unknown market value 
which is common to all bidders. The bidders 
receive only an estimation of this common 
value, denoted by m. An easy CV design is that 
the true value of m is the average of the 6 
estimates bidders received. The ranges of 
estimates for singleton, dual and grand subsets 
are revealed to the bidders, which are 
respectively, [20,40], [40,80], and [60,120].  
2. CV hard 
Again the true common value, m, is 
unknown to the bidders. And bidders are told 
that the estimates they receive are randomly 
drawn form the interval ( )3.01±×m . This 
structure means that the estimates maybe too 
high or too low by a 30 percent margin.  
All the experiments of this year are 
conducted in Room 2618 in the Economic 
Department of Soochow University. We have 
written EXCEL macros to calculate the revenue 
maximizing allocation and VCG prices. We 
have also completed a simple computer 
interface for subjects to submit their bids, as 
shown in Fig.13. The auctioneer could monitor 
the progress of the biding process, as shown in 
Fig.14. 
Fig.15 shows an assistant reading the instruction 
to the subject, Fig.16 shows an assistant 
recording the auction result on the blackboard 
and subjects checking their payoffs. And Fig.17 
and 18 show subjects determining their bids.

VCG is an interest research topic because it is 
one good demonstration of the fact that there 
are sometimes gaps between theories and the 
real world. As the title of one paper amply calls 
it, VCG seems to be a lovely but lonely 
theoretical construct. Theoretical analysis 
predicts that people under the VCG mechanism 
could bid their true valuation, and the outcomes 
are efficient allocations. We will test whether 
these predictions could be supported by the 
behavior record of our subject.  
We have now only had a first glance of the 
data. Based on our research design and 
preliminary observations from the data, we will 
formally test the following hypotheses.  
Hypothesis 1: When facing more packages, 
some subjects chose to ignore some of the 
packages by not entering any bids, hence the 
proportions of zero bids are higher when the 
number of available subsets are larger.  
Hypothesis 2: A direct implication of the 
above hypothesis is that the bidding functions 
( )ii vb  would be more nonlinear when subjects 
have more subsets to bid on.  
Hypothesis 3: The bidding functions are 
significantly different for goods with positive 
and negative synergy. 
Hypothesis 4: Comparing with VCG, the 
bids are significantly lower under FPP auctions, 
but the revenues higher.  
Hypothesis 5: The bidding function ( )ii vb  
is different for PV, CV easy and CV hard 
environment. Bidders downward adjust their 
bids when the level of uncertainty is higher.  
Hypothesis 6: We also employed a 
domain-specific risk-attitude scale and expect 
that subjects with higher risk attitudes scale 
would bid more aggressively in the auction.

著無線電技術如 WiMAX 及 LTE 的快速發
展，電子書閱讀器平台在 60 秒內完成一本電
子書的下載任務也是大有可為的，這樣的服
務便非常適合利用短期頻譜空檔的支援。而
智慧型運輸系統 (Intelligent Transportation 
System，ITS)、軍方、緊急救護及預付卡服務
等，都是短時段占用頻帶的例子，在通訊技
術保證可以在有需求時提供一定品質的傳

A.2 研究方法 
A.2.1 動態頻譜拍賣經濟架構 
Sengupta及Chatterjee (2009)提出了動態
頻譜拍賣的經濟架構模型[29]，本研究將之調
整分為四個層級，分別是行動營運商
(MNOs)、行動虛擬營運商(MVNOs/WSPs)、
頻譜仲介者(Spectrum broker)與終端使用者
(End users)。本研究的整體經濟架構在圖8中
36 
決定參與競標的行動虛擬營運商其第一
件任務為決定在下一回合的拍賣中需要多少
個頻道。假定行動虛擬營運商-i 在下一回合會
有 Ui 個顧客來使用服務，而每個顧客在下一
小時的平均使用服務次數為λi，λi的決定是對
過去的資訊取隨機 Poisson 分布後所得。每個
顧客單次使用服務的周期為 Ti，統計資料顯
示，手機使用者有 80%的比例會在 3 分鐘內
結束通話，平均使用服務的時間則為 1 分鐘，
使用服務周期的分布呈 Exponential 遞減，行
動營運商可以推估出平均的使用服務週期。
另外，設定單一頻道可容納的使用者數目為
C，c 則為滿足基本服務需求之外所需增購的
頻道數。可以推得下一回合所需的頻道數 Ji

(2) 標金決策模型 
在進行標金計算前，我們將競標者的投
標行為(Bidding Behavior)分為三種類型：積極
出價、正常出價和保守出價。以期望利率(Es%)
來做區別，積極出價將會最高的期望利率
比，依序為正常出價與保守出價。 
假定參與競標的行動虛擬營運商其期望
利潤(Expected Profit)皆為大於 0。因此，由下
式可以開始進行投標金額的試算。 
利潤 = 收益 - 花費 > 0 
收益部分是根據所有使用者(Ui)在 X 時
段的平均使用服務次數(λi)及時間(Ti)及業者
所收取的服務費率(ωi)來計算，如下式，行動
虛擬營運商-i 在標得 j 個頻道後的收益 Ri,j 為 
)1( ,, jiiiiiji bTUR −××××= ωλ  
其中的 bi,j 為行動營運商-i 在標得 j 個頻
道後，終端使用者請求服務時被阻斷的機
率，(1-bi,j)則是代表服務不被阻斷的機率。我
們另外做了一個假設是，當使用者請求服務
被拒絕後，將不再進行請求的動作，因此行
動營運商將無法從此使用者身上獲得收入。 
支出部分則包含了行動虛擬營運商業者
的基本營運支出(Running Cost)、投標金額
(Bid Price)、支付給仲介者的佣金(Commission 
to Broker)及競標失敗後必須付出的懲罰金額
(Penalty)。行動虛擬營運商-i 基本支出我們用
一常數 RCi 來表示；所需支付的佣金則為標
得頻道後，投標金額(αi,j)乘上一固定佣金比例
(β)。可推得投標金額為

根據此標金決策模型，搭配MVNO的營
運數據及參數，計算3個MVNO的標單資訊為 
MVNO-1：($117.74，$1018.1，$1703.64，
$1952.69) 
MVNO-2：($272.77，$1131.9，$1565.19) 
MVNO-3：($414.93，$1084.45) 
以2.3.2.2小節的決標模型來判定拍賣5個
頻道時的贏家，將由MVNO-1贏得3個頻道，
MVNO-2贏得2個頻道。 
A.2.4  短期頻譜拍賣系統架構 
本短期頻譜拍賣系統 (Short Interval 
Spectrum Auction System, SISA)擁有三個使
用者介面 (Graphic User Interface, GUI)，分別
為 MNO Registration GUI, Auctioneer Control 
GUI與MVNO Bidding GUI，以利行動營運商
(MNO)、拍賣者(Auctioneer)與行動虛擬營運
商(MVNO)使用。在使用者介面設計上，本研
究使用了Flash CS4[31]進行設計與實做，同時
使用php[32]網路程式語言實作與編寫我們所
設計的演算法並與使用者介面進行串連。在
資料庫的選擇方面，我們選擇與php整合度相
當高的免費軟件MySQL 4.0.24[33]。最後，網
路伺服器方面，也是採用了來自The Apache 
Software Foundation[34]的免費產品Apache 
1.3.33版本。

一、會議簡介 
In spite of the cancellation of DySPAN2009 due to the economical down turn, IEEE 
DySPAN 2010 brought together experts and researchers of cutting-edge and 
cross-disciplinary research in technology, economics and policy of dynamic spectrum 
access and cognitive radios.  The aim is to build a healthy industry/regulatory 
ecosystem for the commercialization of smart radio system technologies. The 5 keynote 
speakers delivered exciting and thought-provoking speeches and technical 
presentations. The technical program is comprised of technology and policy tracks 
including panels and poster sessions. There are 64 papers with an acceptance rate of 
34%. In addition, there were also a full day of tutorials, three days of live 
demonstrations by both technology companies and academic research institutions, two 
panels, and "5-minute madness" talks for demo presenters who were also given the 
opportunity to include short 2-page papers in the proceedings. The symposium patrons 
include Alcatel-Lucent, Microsoft Research, UMIC, iNETS, IEEE Singapore Section, 
IEEE Communications Society Singapore Chapter and ROHDE &SCHWARZ.

Development” and focuses on the role that Communications is playing in the fast 
development of Africa.  ICC 2010 overall program comprises 11 technical symposia, 2 
plenary sessions, 6 business panels, 20 tutorials and 10 workshops. ICC 2010 received 
2618 paper submissions from over 70 countries and accepted 1035 symposium papers 
from 54 countries and regions, which were presented in 135 oral presentation sessions 
and 39 poster style sessions. 
 
The First International Workshop on Social Networks was organized by Profs. K.-C. 
Chen, NTU, and Prof. Naohisa Ohta, Keio University.  There are 10 papers with Prof. 
Vincent Poor of Princeton University as a Keynote speaker.  The subjects covered 
include 
- Social network behaviors, dynamics, modeling, and analysis;  
- Representation, measurement, modeling of relationship;  
- Social network topology, complex network theory, random graph, and relationship 
to statistical mechanics or biology; 
- Web connections and grid/cloud computing;  
- Applications and services to Internet, multimedia networks, e-commerce, and 
mobile-commerce.  
 
二、參加會議經過  
During 05/23/2009 -05/26/2010, Shi-Chung Chang  
(1) presented the paper entitled “Behavior Modeling of Teaching Material Sharing 
Network” in the First International Workshop on Social Networks;  
(2) attended keynote speeches and technical session sessions on wireless 
communication, spectrum management, P2P network design and cognitive radio; 
and 
(3) exchanged ideas with researchers of similar research interests. 
 
(4) 與會心得 
1. Paper topics of The First International Workshop on Social Networks were broad.  
A special interest group on social networks has been formed by Prof. K.-C. Chang 
of NTU.  Hopefully there will be more papers and focused topics in ICC 2011. 
2. Chinese researchers and graduate students from China demonstrated both their 
research strength and abundance in funding.   
3. As this is the first time I attend ICC, I get to know many new friends. 
4. The Internet access was quite poor in the conference center.  Internet access is 
quite expensive because Telekom monopolizes the last mile in South Africa.
