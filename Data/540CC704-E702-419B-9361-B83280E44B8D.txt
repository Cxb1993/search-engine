Abstract 
   It has been used widely that analysis of blood pressure (BP) variability in the 
frequency domain has been useful in pathophysiologic research into the nature of cardiovascular 
regulation. Regularity or complexity characteristics of physiological signal fluctuations have 
attained importance in the evaluation of a variety of pathological conditions. A nonlinear 
approach, approximate entropy (ApEn), was applied to analyze the complexity of arterial blood 
pressure (ABP) waveform. Fourteen age-matched healthy adults and nineteen diabetic 
autonomic neuropathy (DAN) subjects were chosen for this experiment. The blood pressure 
waveform was continuously measured with Finapres device in both the supine and tilt-up 
positions. The values of ApEn for normals in both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) 
were statistically smaller than that of DAN patients in tilt-up position (Normals DBP: 0.207?
0.059, DANs DBP: 0.306?0.104, p?0.01; Normals SBP: 0.183?0.052, DANs SBP: 0.336?
0.141, p?0.01). However, no significant difference of ApEn values was found in both SBP and 
DBP in supine position between normals and DANs. The results llustrated that the neural 
control associated with DAN patients is more irregular than that of normals. Cross ApEn 
(Co-ApEn) was also applied to evaluate the dynamic variation of the pattern similarity between 
SBP and DBP in both normals and DANs. The results showed that the Co-ApEn between SBP 
and DBP of DANs is significantly larger that that of normals in tilt-up position (Normals: 0.183
?0.063, DANs: 0.268?0.083, p?0.01). It indicates that SBP and DBP signals are more similar 
to each other in normals. (Acknowledgement: The authors would like to thank the National

generated by CBFV and ABP values to assess CA and it 
provided important clinical information [4-7]. Nevertheless, 
most experiments demand the introduction of variations in 
ABP via physiological or pharmacological manipulations. It is 
not easy to find proper approaches to assess CA non-invasively 
and reliably by simple and acceptable measurements. Recent 
investigations have shown that the autoregulatory dynamic 
response can be identified from spontaneous fluctuations in 
mean ABP (MABP) and CBFV [8] and assessed the dynamic 
relationship between spontaneous MABP and CBFV using 
transfer function analysis in either normal subjects [9-10] or 
autonomic failure patients [11]. Spectral and transfer function 
analyses of CBFV and ABP were performed by fast Fourier 
transform (FFT) in their studies. However, the stationary 
property and time resolution are two crucial issues for spectral 
analysis. 
Time-domain cross-correlation function (CCF) has been 
recently utilized by previous investigators as a means to assess 
the dynamics of CA [12-16]. In addition, cross-correlation 
analysis of blood pressure and heart rate variability has been 
applied to investigate the relationship between pulse interval 
and systolic arterial blood pressure [17]. Previous study showed 
that CCF would be a useful tool to assess CA in normal 
subjects [16]. The main purpose of this research is to use 
time-domain cross-correlation analysis of pre-filtered MABP 
and mean CBFV (MCBFV) to assess the cerebral 
autoregulation in normal subjects, diabetics without autonomic 
neuropathy and diabetics with autonomic neuropathy. 
 
Materials and methods 
2.1 Subjects and measurements 
There were 3 groups of subjects (sex and age matched) 
being recruited in this study, i.e., 10 healthy adults for normal 
subjects (group 1), 10 diabetics without autonomic neuropathy 
(group 2) and 10 diabetics with autonomic neuropathy (group 
3). The subjects in group 1 were included only if they had no 
history of vascular disease, heart problems, hypertension, 
migraine, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm, intracerebral bleeding or 
other pre-existing neurological conditions. None of the subjects 
were receiving any medication during the time of the study. 
CBFV was measured in the right middle cerebral artery using 
TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, EME TC2020) in 
conjunction with a 5-MHz transducer fixed over the temporal 
bones by an elastic headband. Continuous ABP recordings 
were obtained through the Finapres (Ohmeda 2300) device 
with the cuff attached to the middle finger of the right hand. 
Subjects were investigated on a tilt-table that enabled a 
motor-driven change from a supine to an upright position 
within 10 seconds. Data acquisition was started after a 10-min 
relaxation in supine position. Spontaneous ABP and CBFV 
were recorded simultaneously to PC for off-line analysis. The 
acquisition periods were approximately 5 minutes in both the 
supine and o75 tilt-up positions by a self-developed data 
acquisition system as shown in Figure 1. The personal 
computer combined with a general-purpose data acquisition 
board and LabVIEW environment for acquiring signals 
correctly was developed in our previous study [18]. The 
sampling rate to acquire the analog data from TCD and 
Finapres was adjustable in this system. In our experiments, the 
sampling rate is set to 60 Hz. The MABP and MCBFV signals

are bandpass filtered in the very low-frequency (VLF, 
0.015-0.04 Hz), low-frequency range (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and 
high-frequency range (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz) before applying CCF 
for the purpose of studying the effect of different bandwidths 
on the resulting mean CCFs.

time index in the (i-1)th pulse beat, and iV  is the time index 
of the wave-trough in the ith pulse beat. Therefore, iMABP  is 
the calculated mean ABP value for the ith pulse beat. Similarly, 
the mean CBFV value was calculated by each heart beat as 
follows.

CBFV signal corresponding to the ith pulse beat. iMCBFV  is 
the mean value of CBFV for the ith pulse beat. Afterward, the 
MABP and MCBFV time series calculated by Equations (1) 
and (2) are placed at regular intervals equal to their mean heart 
period. Before calculating the CCF between MABP and 
MCBFV time series, MABP and MCBFV were normalized by 
using their mean values. Assume that the normalized MABP 
and MCBFV time series are )(nf  and )(ng  respectively. 
The normalized MABP and MCBFV time series can be 
calculated as follows:

CCF values in LF in supine position for group 1 (Table 2) is 
more obvious than that for group 2 and group 3 (group 1: 0.52?
0.15, group 2: 0.42?0.17, group 3: 0.32?0.14). On the other

hand, the fluctuations of standard deviation in LF in supine 
position for group 1 are smaller than that for group 2 and group 
3 (maximum CCF SD of group 1: 0.17?0.08, maximum CCF 
SD of group 2: 0.22?0.12, maximum CCF SD of group 3: 0.21
?0.10). A detailed list of the CCF results for group 1, group 2 
and group 3 are shown in Table 2. In VLF range, there was no 
significant difference for the maximum CCF values in each 
group as shown in Table 2. Moreover, the maximum CCF 
standard deviations are large. Hence, the relation between 
MABP and MCBFV is uncertain. According to previous study 
results for VLF range, it also showed that the correlation 
between MABP and MCBFV is low, the results are agreed with 
the previous results [16,19]. On the other hand, the results 
indicate that averages of (maximum CCF SD)/(maximum CCF 
value) in LF for supine position for group 1 are smaller than 
that for group 3 and exists significant difference. It depicts that 
the fluctuations of normal subjects in LF for supine position are 
smaller than that of group 3. The low fluctuations indicate high 
correlation and the results can be observed from the maximum 
CCF values as shown in Table 2. In (a) of Figure 2, Figure 3 
and Figure 4, “coh.” indicates the coherence between MABP 
and MCBFV, which were presented as mean±SD. The curves

SD)/(maximum CCF value). Moreover, the distribution plot for 
group 2 is between group 1 and group 3. This trend indicates 
that correlations of both MABP and MCBFV for group 1 are 
higher and variations are lower comparing to group 3. 
Discussion 
It is important to ensure safety and harmlessness for 
patients by non-invasive treatment, especially for diabetics. 
Therefore, we must look more carefully into that how to treat 
patients in an appropriate process to keep from secondly injury. 
The advances in TCD and computerized acquisition techniques 
have allowed simultaneous recording and analysis of velocity 
signals from the intracranial arteries with other physiological 
parameters. This study focused mainly on using the 
time-domain cross-correlation approach to test the effects of 
changes in MABP on MCBFV. The MABP and MCBFV 
signals were bandpass filtered before applying cross-correlation 
analysis for the purpose of studying the effect of different 
bandwidths on the resulting mean CCF. Cross-correlation 
analysis can provide correlation and phase relationship between 
MABP and MCBFV. The mean and standard deviation analysis 
results listed in Table 1 showed that the changes in MABP 
resulted in an insignificant change in MCBFV. The mean 
MABP value changed more than that of MCBFV from the 
supine to tilt-up positions in group 3. In this research, we found 
that the mean values of MABP dropped significantly in tilt-up 
position for group 3 compare with group 1 and group 2. 
The effect of spontaneous MABP changes to MCBFV was 
evaluated by the cross-correlation analysis in time-domain and 
the results were shown in Table 2. According to the results of 
previous study that applied time-domain cross-correlation 
analysis in normal subjects [16], it showed that correspond time 
lag is –1.20±0.91 seconds in LF range and is –0.07±0.42 
seconds in HF range. Compare to previous study, the results in 
this study (time lag is –1.01±1.17 seconds in LF range and 
is –0.08±0.25 seconds in HF range) are close to the results 
obtained in the previous study. We may say that CCF could be 
an appropriate method to assess CA. We also adopted 
maximum CCF value and (maximum CCF SD)/(maximum 
CCF value) to be critical indices to correct CCF lag time. The 
parameters of maximum CCF value and (maximum CCF 
SD)/(maximum CCF value) indicate that correlation in supine 
position for normal subjects is higher than that for diabetics 
without autonomic neuropathy and diabetics with autonomic 
neuropathy. Figure 5 reveals this trend as mentioned above. On 
the other hand, the phase relationship between MABP and 
MCBFV can be established easily by computing the correlation 
for a number of different lags and taking the significant value 
as the correct value. The phase shift analysis between MABP 
and MCBFV demonstrated its usefulness as a test of dynamic 
autoregulation [20]. In our study, the results of 
cross-correlation analysis in Table 2 revealed that a good 
relation between MCBFV and MABP in the LF range in 
normal subjects with supine position. In contrast to group 1, the 
relationship is poor in the LF range in supine position for group 
2 and group 3. It also means that the CA mechanism of the 
group 1 is better than the other two groups. The negative lag of 
the CCF peak between MABP and MCBFV is a result of the 
phase-lead property and it also indicates that CA is a highpass 
filter. The increasing time lag of the CCF peak might be a good 
evidence to show the disturbance of autoregulatory effect. The 
cross-correlation analysis indicated that the MCBFV preceded 
MABP in LF range. In LF range, time lag in group 1 with 
supine position is more than 1 second but the values in the 
other two group are smaller than 0.5. It might mean that the CA 
mechanism in group 1 works better than diabetics. Generally, 
the maximum CCF values in VLF range are smaller than that in 
LF range of both group 1 and group 2. However, its standard 
deviation is the largest among the three groups. Therefore, it 
indicates that the relation of MABP and MCBFV is uncertain 
in VLF range. As to the results in the HF range, the time lags 
between MABP and MCBFV were closer to the origin. It 
implies that CA is less efficient in the HF range. Some 
investigators presumed that a failure to autoregulate manifests 
as a zero or nearly zero time delay [14]. Therefore, we 
conclude that the CA operates efficiently in the LF range rather 
than in HF range. According to the results, cross-correlation 
analysis and non-invasive method has been shown a useful tool 
in estimating the dynamic response of CA. Our future work 
involves reproducing our findings in a larger population that 
might show absence or impairment of cerebral autoregulation 
and might be helpful in clinical practice.

Introduction 
Cerebrovascular diseases have become a global burden to human beings for several decades. 
Cerebrovascular diseases are the top-ten leading causes of mortality in Taiwan [1]. Hypertensive 
diseases, one of the risks that induce cerebrovascular diseases, negatively influence people’s health 
all over the world [2]. However, it is still uncertain whether ischemic stroke patients in the acute 
phase need antihypertensive drug treatment. Some studies have revealed that blood pressure in the 
acute phase of an ischemic stroke is raised to help restore cerebral perfusion, which activates the 
collateral arterial supply and minimizes the infarct size. It has been postulated that antihypertensive 
drugs should be taken when the blood pressure is too high [4, 8, 14]. Nevertheless, some other 
studies were opposed to this conclusion. Most patients with acute ischemic stroke do not need 
antihypertensive therapy because the rapid decrease in blood pressure may reduce the cerebral 
blood flow owing to impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA) [10, 21]. The balance between the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems controls the blood pressure. Cerebral 
autoregulation is a feedback mechanism, which maintains constant cerebral blood flow despite 
changes in blood pressure [3]. Although the autoregulatory curve in the brain is created by two 
parameters, arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity, to assess whether CA is normal 
or not in humans, CA is more of a concept rather than a physically measurable entity [15]. 
Non-invasive assessment approaches have been developed and adopted to study static or dynamic 
CA [22]. Two non-invasive approaches, spectral and cross-correlation functions (CCFs) analyses, 
were applied to evaluate physiological conditions. Spectral analysis can be used to evaluate the 
autonomic nerve system [16, 18]. Previous spectral analysis studies indicated that the ratio of low- 
to high-frequency power (L/H) could be considered as an index of sympathetic activity in 
hypertensive patients [11]. CCF analysis has been utilized by previous investigators as a means to 
characterize dynamic CA [5, 17, 19, 20]. In previous studies, CCFs analysis was applied to assess 
and quantify CA between normal subjects and diabetics. The results showed that CCF could be a 
useful tool in assessing CA [6, 7]. Melenovasky et al. [13] adopted two different hypolipidemic 
drugs to compare the effects in patients with hyperlipidemia. Their result showed that the difference 
between the effects of both drugs was found only for blood lipids. Kanaya et al. [9] compared the 
differential HRV effects of two drugs, Propofol and Sevoflurane. Results indicated that Sevoflurane 
has little or no effect on the cardiac parasympathetic tone. In this study, the mean arterial blood 
pressure (MABP) and mean cerebral blood flow velocity (MCBFV) signals were acquired during 
both supine and tilting positions before and after 2 months treatment. These two signals were 
bandpass-filtered in the low frequency (LF: 0.07-0.15 Hz) and high frequency ranges (HF: 
0.15-0.40 Hz) before applying both spectral and CCF analyses to the effects of antihypertensive 
drugs on different bandwidths. Two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec, were adopted to

where CBFV(?) is the CBFV signal continuously acquired from the TCD. CBFVi is the time index 
of the wave-trough in the CBFV signal corresponding to the ith pulse beat and N is the total number 
between ith pulse beat and (i+1)th pulse beat. MCBFVi is the mean value of CBFV for the ith pulse 
beat. 
Power spectral density analysis 
Spectral analysis can be used to explore the specific autonomic nervous system activity. 
MABP and MCBFV signals are bandpass filtered in the low frequency range (0.07-0.15 Hz) and 
high frequency range (0.15-0.40 Hz) before applying spectral analysis. The ratio of low- to 
high-frequency power (L/H) was calculated as an index of sympathetic-vagal activity. 
Power spectral density is calculated as follows. A discrete-time signal x(n), the discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT) analysis relationship is:  
 
 
                                    k=0,1,2…,N-1  ………………………………..(3) 
 
 
Then power spectral density is given by:

density function.

In time domain, results revealed that the values of MABP in the group with Cozaar were reduced 
significantly after 2 months treatment in both supine and tilt-up positions. However, there was no 
significant reduction in the group with Renitec after 2 months treatment. It may show that Cozzar 
seems to have more manifest effect on lowering blood pressure than that of Renitec. On the other 
hand, the MCBFV values in the two groups have no significant difference after 2 months treatment 
(Table 1, 2).

In the spectral analysis, the ratio of low- to high-frequency power (L/H, an index of 
sympathetic-vagal activity) was increased more in the Renitec group compared to the Cozaar group 
in MABP and MCBFV after 2 months treatment (Table 3, 4). This may indicate that Cozaar has 
more manifest effect for suppressing the sympathetic nervous system activity than Renitec.

The CCF result from one sample in the normal group as shown in Fig.3. The maximum CCF value, 
maximum CCF time index and corresponding time lag, maximum CCF time are shown. Similarly, 
the minimum CCF value, minimum CCF time index and minimum CCF time can also be 
observed. According to previous research, the CCF peak in the negative time index is a result of 
the phase-lead property. The increasing time lag stands for evidence of cerebral autoregulation 
disturbance [6, 7].

indices. The line with symbols (?) is the mean CCF value in each time index. The line with symbols (?) is the standard 
CCF deviation in each time index. 
Tables 5, 6 and 7 reveal the CCF results from normal subjects, Cozaar group and Renitec 
group in the low frequency bandwidth. In the Cozaar group, the maximum CCF value increased and 
the coefficient of variation (CV) of the maximum CCF value decreased in the tilt position after 2 
months treatment. This value was significantly different after treatment (p?0.05). Moreover, the 
CV of the maximum CCF values was significantly different between the supine and tilt positions 
after 2 months treatment (p?0.05). This might indicate that the correlation between MABP and 
MCBFV improved and became more stable after the Cozaar treatment. The maximum CCF index 
value in the Renitec group increased and became significantly different (p?0.05) in the supine 
position after 2 months treatment. Therefore, this might indicate that the cerebral autoregulation 
disturbance function was better after treatment. Before treatment, the maximum CCF time and CCF 
index values were significantly different (p?0.05) between the supine and tilt positions. After 
treatment, the CV of the maximum CCF index and CCF values decreased and became significantly 
different (p?0.05) between the supine and tilt positions. Other CCF analysis results from the 
Cozaar and Renitec groups did not change significantly after 2 months treatment.

Moreover, the maximum CCF time and CCF time index values for the Renitec group were 
significantly different (p?0.05) from those in the normal group before treatment. The maximum 
CCF values for the Cozaar group were significantly different (p?0.05) from those in the normal 
group before treatment. After 2 months treatment, all of the CCF analysis results for both the 
Cozaar and Renitec groups were close to those for normal group subjects. This might indicate that 
patients with hypertension will exhibit normal blood pressure values after treatment with these two 
antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec. 
Table 8, 9 and 10 reveal the CCF results for normal subjects, Cozaar group and the Renitec 
group in the high frequency bandwidth. These results did not show significant in HF changes after 2 
months of treatment for these two groups. The CCF results for the normal group did not show a 
significant difference from the Cozaar and Renitec groups. Hence, the CCF results were not 
manifested in HF and agreed with the result from the previous study [6].

be more obvious in the LF range. According to previous research, the left-shift (negative lag) of the 
CCF peak between MABP and MCBFV is a result of the phase-lead property. The increasing time 
lag of the CCF peak might be evidence of auto-regulatory disturbance. As the CCF HF results show 
in tables 8, 9 and 10, the maximum CCF time values in the HF range were closer to zero than those 
in the LF range. It may be inferred that CA is less efficient in the HF range. Hence, it is helpful to 
filter the MABP and MCBFV signals before applying them to CCF analysis. The CV of the 
maximum CCF value in the LF range decreased significantly (p＜0.05) in the tilt position in both 
the Cozaar and Renitec groups. Because CV stands for a relative dispersion measurement, it may 
reveal that the CA conditions of hypertensive patients are more stable after 2 months treatment with 
Cozaar or Renitec. 
Figures 4, 5, and 6 show a the LF range CCF results comparison for patients and normal 
subjects. After treatment with Cozaar or Renitec, the CCF analysis results became close to the 
normal values. The results between normal persons and patients don’t have significant difference (p
?0.05). The maximum CCF time and index indicated the phase between MABP and MCBFV. 
Therefore, the CA function will tend to be normal after treatment. The max CCF value became 
higher after treatment, which means that the correlation between MABP and MCBFV became 
higher. This is evidence that the cerebral autoregulation has been improved. A previous study 
revealed that these two drugs were beneficial to patients. Therefore, the CCF analysis results agree 
with the results from the previous study [12].

1. Introduction 
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that occurs when the body does not produce enough 
insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin. Most people with diabetes are the type that cannot use 
the insulin properly. However, many diabetics have no symptoms and are only diagnosed after 
many years of onset. As a consequence, almost half of diabetics with the type that cannot use the 
insulin properly are not aware that they have this life-threatening condition and diabetes has already 
been one of leading causes of mortality in the world [31]. Diabetes with autonomic neuropathy is 
probably the most common complication of diabetes. Neuropathy can lead to sensory loss and 
damage to the limbs. Complications of both vascular and nervous systems are the major risk factors 
for mortality of diabetics. According to previous researches, about 70% of diabetics have autonomic 
nervous dysfunctions. Moreover, it is about 2~4 times risks for a diabetic patient to have a stroke 
than an age-matched subject. The crucial factor of cerebrovascular diseases is cerebral 
autoregulation (CA). Cerebral autoregulation is a feedback mechanism, which maintains cerebral 
blood flow constant despite change of blood pressure [1]. 
It is not easy to find proper approaches or tools to assess CA non-invasively. Most experiments 
demand the introduction of variations in ABP via physiological or pharmacological manipulations 
in the past. With the progress of medical technology rapidly, non-invasive medical instruments were 
well developed in decades. Therefore, several non-invasive approaches have been developed and 
adopted to study static or dynamic CA [27]. Though the autoregulatory curve in the brain can be 
characterized by two parameters, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity 
(CBFV), to assess if CA is normal or not in humans, CA is more a concept rather than a physically 
measurable entity [20]. CA has been investigated by using many time and frequency domain 
analysis methods [4,6,16,26]. Some investigators used autoregulatory index (ARI) generated by 
CBFV and ABP values to quantify and evaluate CA and it provided important clinical information 
[3,12,20,22]. Previous researchers utilized cross-correlation function (CCF) to assess the dynamics 
  68
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Subjects and measurements 
There were 2 groups of subjects being recruited in this study, i.e., 11 healthy adults for normal 
subjects (group 1) and 19 age-matched diabetics with autonomic neuropathy (group 2). All subjects 
were informed consent prior to entry to the study and it had been approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of Cheng-Ching General Hospital. The subjects in group 1 were included only if they 
had no history of cardiovascular disease, heart problems, hypertension, migraine, epilepsy, cerebral 
aneurysm, intracerebral bleeding or other pre-existing neurological conditions. None of the subjects 
were receiving any medication during the period of the study. CBFV was measured in the middle 
cerebral artery using TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, EME TC2020) in conjunction with a 
5-MHz transducer fixed over the temporal bones by an elastic headband. Continuous ABP 
recordings were obtained through the Finapres (Ohmeda 2300) device with the cuff attached to the 
middle finger of the right hand. Subjects were investigated on a tilt-table that enabled a 
motor-driven change from a supine to an upright position 75? within 4 seconds. Data acquisition 
was started after a 10-min relaxation in supine position. Spontaneous ABP and CBFV were 
recorded simultaneously to PC for off-line analysis. The acquisition periods were approximately 5 
minutes in both the supine and 75?tilt-up positions by a self-developed data acquisition system as 
shown in Fig. 1. The personal computer combined with a general-purpose data acquisition board 
and LabVIEW environment for acquiring signals correctly was developed in our previous study [5]. 
The sampling rate to acquire the analog data from TCD and Finapres was adjustable in this system. 
In our experiments, the sampling rate is set to 60 Hz.

is the time index of the wave-trough in the CBFV signal corresponding to the (i-1)th pulse beat and 
iD  is the time index of the wave-trough in the CBFV signal corresponding to the ith pulse beat. 
iMCBFV  is the mean value of CBFV for the ith pulse beat. Afterward, the MABP and MCBFV time 
series calculated by Equations (1) and (2) are placed at regular intervals equal to their mean heart 
period. 
2.4 Nonlinear analysis 
Three nonlinear parameters, correlation dimension (CD), Lyapunov exponent (LE), and 
Kolmogorov entropy (K2) [13], were calculated from the MABP and MCBFV segments. The signal 
was reconstructed from the time series before measuring the chaotic properties to determine the 
signal complexity and regularity. A new coordinate system called the phase space was used to 
reconstruct an attractor. The phase space is a coordinate system that expresses the behavior of a 
dynamic system. In the phase space, the dynamic system behavior (trajectory or orbit) converges 
into the stationary state, called the attractor. Because the number of phase space coordinates cannot 
be calculated directly from the time series data, it is necessary to reconstruct the n-dimensional 
phase space from a single time series measurement record. The n-dimensional attractor can be 
reconstructed from one-dimension time series projected data using the delay embedding method. 
The n-dimensional vector is constructed as follows. 
{ ))1((,),(),()( ττ −++= dmtxtxtxtX L  
where )(tX is the newly reconstructed n-dimensional vector. τ  is the delay time, dm  is an

2.4.2 Lyapunov exponent 
The Lyapunov exponent quantifies the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It is an 
important feature of chaotic systems and describes how small changes in the state of a system grow 
at an exponential rate and eventually dominate the behavior. The Lyapunov exponent is defined as 
the long time average exponential rates of divergence of nearby states. As shown in Fig. 5, assume 
  74
when K2=0, the system is regular; K2=∞ , the system is random; K2>0 and finite, the system has 
chaotic behavior. 
3. Results 
3.1 Linear analysis results [15] 
The MABP signal in the finger was acquired by using Finapres. The MCBFV signal of the 
middle cerebral artery was acquired by using TCD ultrasound. Both values were measured 
continuously during supine and tilt-up positions for 5 minutes in normal and diabetic subjects. 256 
points were acquired for each position. Typical MABP and MCBFV signals for a normotensive 
subject during supine and tilt-up positions are represent in Fig. 6. Typical results shown in Fig. 7 
indicate that both MABP and MCBFV for diabetes with autonomic neuropathy decrease in the 
tilt-up position. However, MABP and MCBFV for normal subjects (as shown in Fig. 6) revealed no 
obvious difference in both the supine and tilt-up positions. The analysis results are listed in Table 1.

The relationship between MABP and MCBFV is shown in Fig. 8 (A) and (B). The results 
revealed that the data for normal subjects in the supine and tilt-up positions were more concentrated. 
Conversely, the data for diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy were distinctly separated.

3.2 Nonlinear chaotic analysis results 
The MABP correlation functions during supine and tilt-up positions in typical normal subjects 
are shown in Fig. 9 (A) and (B). The MABP correlation functions during supine and tilt-up 
positions for typical diabetic patients with ANS diabetic neuropathy dysfunction are shown in Fig. 
10 (A) and (B). Each curve was plotted by )(RCd  vs. R. and each curve means specific embedding 
dimension.

Fig. 10. However, the MCBFV CD showed no change. MABP LE values for normal and diabetic 
subjects in the supine position (Normals: 1.704?0.995; Diabetics: 1.016?0.415; p<0.05) and  
MCBFV LE values for diabetics in the supine and tilt-up positions (Supine: 1.058?0.333; Tilt-up: 
0.797?0.382; p<0.05) were significantly different. The K2 in both the normotensive subjects and 
diabetics were not statistically significant. The only difference was that the K2 MCBFV values for 
normal and diabetic subjects in the tilt-up were statistically significantly different (Normals: 2.835?
0.461; Patients: 3.323?0.568; p<0.05). The results are listed in Table 2.

decreased while head-up tilting. The results agreed with the previous study [18]. However, CD and 
LE have different physiological meanings. CD can indicate complexity of a system and LE 
describes the sensitivity of an initial condition. Therefore, it could be speculated that tilting in 
diabetics with autonomic neuropathy can affect the sensitivity of the initial condition but 
complexity in MCBFV. In contrast to MCBFV, the effect of tilting on MABP could not alter 
sensitivity of the initial condition even if the CD values changed significantly in diabetics with 
autonomic neuropathy. The K2 metric evaluates the degree of chaos in the system. On the other 
hand, positions changing for normal subjects didn’t influence complexity and initial condition in 
both MABP and MCBFV obviously since the values of CD and LE didn’t change significantly. The 
K2 results were not statistically significantly in both the normotensive subjects and diabetics. The 
only difference was that the K2 values of MCBFV in normal and diabetic subjects in the tilt-up 
were significantly statistically different. It might indicate that the degree of chaos in diabetics was 
more than that in normal subjects after tilting. 
In conclusion, the significant difference of nonlinear parameters might stand for somewhat 
impairment of autonomic nervous system in diabetics during supine to tilting positions. According 
to the present results, the nonlinear measures, CD, LE, and K2, are suitable tools to explore the 
nonlinear components of dynamic CA in diabetes with autonomic neuropathy. Previous study 
indicated chaotic nature existed in blood pressure [29]. In the present study, the results indicated not 
only blood pressure was chaotic but also cerebral blood flow velocity was chaotic. The results 
might be helpful for clinical practice in assessing the dynamic CA conditions and can provide 
critical information for physicians. Further studies are needed to understand the physiological 
meanings of chaotic analysis for normal persons and diabetics with autonomic neuropathy in 
clinical practice.

pressure, renal blood flow [12,13] and 
cardiovascular system [14-16]. The correlation 
dimension (CD), one of the indexes of chaos, 
was applied to evaluate the complexity of 
MABP in this study. Melenovasky et al. [17] 
adopted 2 different hypolipidemic drugs to 
compare the effects in patients with 
hyperlipidemia. Their result shows that the 
difference between the effects of both drugs 
was found only for blood lipids. Kanaya et al. 
[18] compared differential effects on HRV of 
two drugs, Propofol and Sevoflurane. Results 
indicated that Sevoflurane has little or no effect 
on cardic parasympathetic tone. We adopted 
two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec, 
to investigate the effects on MABP after 
treatments by using two methods, spectral and 
chaotic analyses, to assess the physiological 
conditions in different antihypertensive drug 
treatment. The aim of this study is to 
investigate the effects of antihypertensive 
therapy and build up treatment guideline for 
hypertensive patients. 
 
2. Methods 
2.1.      Subjects and measurements 
 
Two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and 
Renitec, were adopted to investigate the effects 
on MABP after 2 months treatments. 17 
hypertensive outpatients from the Section of 
Neurology of Cheng-Ching General Hospital 
were enrolled and separated randomly into two 
groups. One group with 9 subjects taking 
Cozaar treatment (mean age?SD=50.11?10.30 
years), the other group with 8 subjects taking 
Renitec treatment (mean age?SD=50.75?14.37 
years). Hypertension was defined as a clinic 
blood pressure ? 140/90 mmHg (WHO/ISH 
Guidelines 2000). Blood pressure was 
measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer 
BP monitor. Subjects were examined on a 
tilt-table that enabled a motor-driven change 
from a supine to an upright position within 10 
seconds. Data acquisition was started after a 
10-min relaxation period in the supine position. 
MABP signals were acquired during both 
supine and tilt-up positions before and after 2 
months treatment. The personal computer 
combined with a general-purpose data 
acquisition board and LabVIEW environment 
for acquiring signals correctly was developed 
in our pervious study [19]. 
 
2.2.       Data analysis 
 
In this study, the MABP value was calculated 
for each heart beat as follows: 
 
 
MABPi=  
 
 
where x(?) is the arterial blood pressure pulse 
signal continuously acquired from the analog 
output. Vi-1 is the wave-through time index in 
the (i-1)th pulse beat, and Vi is the time index of 
the wave-through in the ith pulse beat. 
Therefore, MABPi is the calculated MABP 
value for the ith pulse beat. 
 
2.2.1.    Power spectral density analysis 
 
We use spectral analysis of blood pressure to 
explore the specific autonomic nervous system 
activity. MABP signals are bandpass filtered in 
the low frequency range (0.07-0.15 Hz) and 
high frequency range (0.15-0.40 Hz) before 
applying spectral analysis. The ratio of low- to

Renitec after 2 months treatment (Table 1). It 
may showed that Cozzar has more manifest 
effect in lowering blood pressure than that of 
Renitec.

 In spectral analysis, the ratio of low- to 
high-frequency power (L/H, an index of 
sympathetic activity) was increased more in the 
group with Renitec comparing to that with 
Cozaar in MABP after 2 months treatment 
(Table 2, 3). It may indicate that Cozaar has 
more manifest effect for suppressing the 
activity of sympathetic nervous system than 
that of Renitec.

tilting positions after treatment 2 months.

Abstract 
The cerebral autoregulation (CA) mechanism refers 
to the cerebral blood flow tendency to maintain relatively 
constant in the brain. The blood vessel characteristic 
indices were applied to evaluate blood pressure (BP) and 
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals acquiring 
from 10 normal subjects and 60 diabetics separated into 3 
groups with autonomic neuropathy in both supine and 
tilting positions. The results revealed that the 
tilting-to-supine ratio values (tilting/supine) of both mean 
arterial blood pressure (MABP) and systolic arterial blood 
pressure (SABP) in diabetics with severe autonomic 
neuropathy were decreased (tilt/supine＜1) and the values 
were significantly different (p＜0.05) with that in both 
normal subjects and diabetics without autonomic 
neuropathy. It might show that the autonomic neuropathy 
has exerted an influence on the change of blood pressure 
in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy. The results of 
blood vessel characteristic indices showed that diabetics 
with autonomic neuropathy have higher values in both 
resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) than that of 
normal subjects. Also, the index values are significantly 
different (p ? 0.05). The values of cerebrovascular 
resistance (CVR) are also higher in diabetics than in that 
of normal subject. These index values indicated that both 
blood resistance and pressure are higher in diabetics. It 
might reveal that diabetes is indeed a risk factor of 
cerebrovascular diseases.

Abstract 
 
The cerebral autoregulation (CA) mechanism 
refers to the cerebral blood flow (CBF) tendency to 
maintain relatively constant in the brain. In this 
study, the time-domain analysis was applied to 
evaluate the relationship between blood pressure and 
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals 
acquiring from normal subjects and diabetics with 
autonomic neuropathy both in supine and tilting 
positions. Besides, the autoregulatory index (ARI) 
was utilized to quantify CA mechanism. The model 
provides an autoregulatory index, which ranges from 
0 (no autoregulation) to 9 (best autoregulation). The 
results revealed that the tilting-to-supine ratio values 
(tilting/supine) of mean arterial blood pressure 
(MABP) and diastolic pressure were significantly 
different (p? 0.05) between supine and tilting 
positions. However, it didn’t change obviously in 
cerebral blood flow velocity and it might show that 
the CA mechanism remains relatively workable in 
diabetics. On the other hand, the ARI showed that 
the mean index value in normal subjects is higher 
than that in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy and 
the autoregulatory index values were significantly 
different (p?0.05). It also means that the CA 
mechanisms in normal subjects are better than that in 
diabetics. Therefore, the ARI can be a useful tool to 
quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation in clinical 
practice.

blood, pressure is raised to help restoring cerebral 
perfusion which activates collateral arterial supply and 
enhances the treatment goal of minimizing infarct size so 
that antihypertensive drug should be taken when blood 
pressure is too high [3-5]. Nevertheless, some other 
studies were opposed to this conclusion. Most patients 
with acute ischemic stroke do not need antihypertensive 
therapy because the rapid decrease of blood pressure may 
reduce cerebral blood flow owing to impaired cerebral 
autoregulation [6-7]. The balance between both 
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems mainly 
controls blood pressure. Cerebral autoregulation is a 
feedback mechanism, which maintains cerebral blood flow 
constant despite change of blood pressure [8]. 
Cross-correlation functions analysis has been applied to 
evaluate dynamic cerebral autoregulation in previous 
studies. It can characterize and quantify CA between 
normal subjects and patients [9-10]. Melenovasky et al. 
[11] adopted 2 different hypolipidemic drugs to compare 
the effects in patients with hyperlipidemia. Their result 
showed that the difference between the effects of both 
drugs was found only for blood lipids. Kanaya et al. [12] 
compared differential effects on HRV of two drugs, 
Propofol and Sevoflurane. Results indicated that 
Sevoflurane has little or no effect on cardic 
parasympathetic tone. In this study, mean arterial blood 
pressure (MABP) signals were acquired during both 
supine and tilt-up positions before and after 2 months 
treatment and bandpass-filtered in the low frequency range 
(0.07-0.15 Hz) before applying cross-correlation functions 
analysis. Two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec, 
were adopted to investigate the effects on MABP after 
treatments by using cross-correlation function analysis to 
assess the physiological conditions in different 
antihypertensive drug treatment. The main purpose of this 
study is to investigate the effects of antihypertensive 
therapy on CA by using CCFs analysis and build up 
treatment guideline for hypertensive patients. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Subjects and measurements 
Two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec, were 
adopted to investigate the effects on the correlation 
between MABP and MCBFV after 2 months treatments. 
17 hypertensive outpatients from the Section of Neurology 
of Cheng-Ching General Hospital were enrolled and 
separated randomly into two groups. One group with 9 
subjects taking Cozaar treatment (age: mean?SD=50.11?
10.30 years), the other group with 8 subjects taking 
Renitec treatment (age: mean?SD=50.75?14.37 years). 
Hypertension was defined as a clinic blood pressure ? 
140/90 mmHg (WHO/ISH Guidelines 2000). Continuous 
ABP signals were acquired via using the Finapres 
(Ohemda 2300). CBFV signals were obtained through 
TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, EME TC2020). 
Subjects were examined on a tilt-table that enabled a 
motor-driven change from a supine to an upright position 
within 10 seconds. Data acquisition was started after a 
10-min relaxation period in the supine position. MABP 
and MCBFV signals were acquired during both supine and 
tilt-up positions before and after 2 months treatment. The 
personal computer combined with a general-purpose data 
acquisition board and LabVIEW 6i environment for 
acquiring signals correctly was developed in our pervious 
study [9-10]. 
Data analysis 
In this study, the MABP value was calculated for each 
heart beat as follows:

The CCF result of one sample in normal group was 
drawn in Fig. 2. It can show the maximum CCF value, 
maximum CCF time index and corresponding time lag, 
maximum CCF time. Similarly, minimum CCF value, 
minimum CCF time index and minimum CCF time can be 
observed. According to previous research, the CCF peak 
in negative time index is a result of the phase-lead 
property. The increasing time lag stands for an evidence of 
cerebral autoregulation disturbance [9-10]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2 CCF result of one sample subject in normal group. k 
is the time index. CCF(k) is the mean value of CCFs in 
time indices. The line with symbols (?) is the mean value 
of CCFs in each time index. The line with symbols (?) is 
the standard deviation of CCFs in each time index. 
Table 3, 4 and 5 revealed that the CCF results of normal 
subjects, Cozaar group and Renitec group. In the group 
with Cozaar, maximum CCF value increased after 2 
months treatment in tilting position. The value was 
significantly different after treatment (p?0.05). It might 
indicate the correlation between MABP and MCBFV was 
improved after the treatment with Cozaar. On the other 
hand, the value of maximum CCF index in the Renitec 
group was increased and significantly different (p?0.05) 
after 2 months treatment. Therefore, it might indicate the 
function of cerebral autoregulation disturbance was better 
than that after treatment. Other results of CCF analysis in 
Cozaar and Renitec groups didn’t change significantly 
after 2 months treatment.

Table 4 CCF analysis results of Cozaar group 
@ p?0.05, PRE indicates before treatment and 2M means treatment 
after 2 months. 
 
Table 5 CCF analysis results of Renitec group 
# p?0.05, PRE indicates before treatment and 2M means treatment after 
2 months. 
Moreover, the values of maximum CCF time and 
maximum CCF time index in Renitec group were 
significantly different (p?0.05) comparing to those in 
normal group before treatment. In Cozaar group, the 
maximum CCF values were significantly different (p?
0.05) comparing to those in normal group before treatment. 
After 2 months treatment, all of the values of CCF 
analysis results in both Cozaar and Renitec groups turned 
to be close to those subjects in normal group. It might 
indicate that patients with hypertension will tend to 
normal after treatment with the two antihypertensive drugs, 
Cozaar and Renitec.
