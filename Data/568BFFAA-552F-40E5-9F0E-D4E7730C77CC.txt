而光纖鎖模雷射所能發展的應用則大致有以下幾個領域： 
（１） 高重複率：通常用來作光通訊、微波光電等應用所需的光源。 
（２） 低雜訊：通常用來作精密量測、量子光學、時序同步等應用所需的光源。 
（３） 短脈衝：通常用來作超快量測、super continuum 產生、光梳頻產生等應用所需的光源。 
（４） 高功率：通常用來作各種工業應用所需的光源。 
本計畫中要發展的光纖鎖模雷射光源大致也是朝著上述四個趨勢來發展，並特別強調高重複率
與低雜訊。 
利用低雜訊鎖模光纖雷射來進行精密量測、量子光學、量子通訊等應用是另一個很有發展潛力
的學術研究領域，譬如利用較低重複率的短脈衝鎖模雷射來作為量子壓縮態的光源[9-11]。在本計
畫中我們則著重探討光固子對量子糾纏態的產生與偵測方法，這是量子光學與量子資訊研究上的一
個重要研究新課題。

IV. 結果與討稐 
過去三年裏我們的研究成果主要是在以下這幾方面： 
１、持續研究非同步鎖模光固子光纖雷射的雷射動力學特性，並藉其特性發展出一個量測光纖色散的
新方法，只需使用 RF spectrum analyzer而不需要用到 Network analyzer 來作色散量測。此研究成
果已發表在 IEEE JQE、PTL 等國際學術期刊。 
２、持續發展新穎光纖元件之製作、設計與應用技術，包括各種短通及帶通光纖式光濾波元件等。這
方面的研究成果有多篇論文已在 IEEE PTL、JLT 等國際學術期刊上發表。 
３、持續發展光纖光固子量子糾結態之產生與偵測的理論，首次嚴格證明在經過非線性交互作用後，
時間多工光纖光固子序列將成為量子糾結態，並首次指出要偵測此種量子糾結特性所需要的特殊
homodyne detection local oscillator pulse-shapes。此研究成果已發表在 Physical Review Letters 之上。 
以下即針對這幾點來進行說明： 
 
１、非同步鎖模光固子光纖雷射與應用 
我們過去幾年來在高重複率（>=10GHz）飛秒級鎖模光纖雷射的研究已獲得很好的成果，
利用所發展之飛秒級非同步光固子鎖模光纖雷射架構可以直接由雷射輸出 500-800fs 的高重複
率脈衝序列（一般之高重複率鎖模光纖雷的脈衝寬度大都為 ps 等級），不需額外之腔外脈寬壓
縮，也不需用到高頻電子電路來作共振腔長控制。在本計畫中我們持續針對非同步鎖模光纖雷
射系統來進行雷射動力學上之理論與實驗研究。利用 Master equation及變分法來對非同步鎖
模光纖雷射進行理論模擬，發現非同步鎖模光纖雷射的輸出脈衝序列會有慢速的週期性變化，
並進而在實驗上也實際量測出其時序週期性變化與中心波長週期性變化的大小，然後與理論結
果來作比較驗證。此一完整的研究成果已發表在 2010 IEEE JQE。 
非同步鎖模光纖雷射的原理約如下圖所示，透過讓相位調變訊號與共振腔諧頻有幾 k 到幾
十 kHz 的差距，共振腔內光固子與相位調變訊號將有一個線性 walk off。由於此時雷射腔內的

利用非同步鎖模光纖雷射的中心頻率會有慢速週期性振盪的特性，上圖所示的量測架構也可用來作為
一種新型光纖色散量測方法，只需使用 RF spectrum analyzer 而不需要用到 Network analyzer 來作
色散量測。此方法在實驗上藉著量測 RF 輸出頻譜上的次諧波分量相對大小可以直接來推測出脈衝時序
上的變化大小。而脈衝中心頻率的慢速週期性振盪在經過色散光纖後則會轉換為慢速週期性的脈衝時
序振盪，此部分的脈衝時序振盪大小將會隨光纖長度（或色散大小）的增大而增大。透過量測經過標
準 SMF 光纖的脈衝時序振盪大小，我們可圖中公式推知脈衝中心波長的慢速週期性振盪大小。在求出
中心波長的慢速週期性振盪大小之後，將 SMF 光纖換為待測光纖然後重作量測，即可利用所得之脈衝
時序振盪大小由相同理論反推待測光纖的色散值。我們針對 LEAF 及 DCF 兩種光纖量其色散值，相當
符合兩種光纖應有的色散值，也由此證明了本量測方法的可行性。這些研究成果已在 2010 IEEE PTL
上發表，結果可見下二圖及下表。

Laser Dynamics of a 10 GHz 0.55 ps Asynchronously
Harmonic Modelocked Er-Doped Fiber Soliton Laser
Wei-Wei Hsiang, Hon-Chieh Chang, and Yinchieh Lai
Abstract—Laser dynamics of a 10 GHz 0.55 ps asynchronously
harmonic modelocked Er-doped fiber soliton laser are investigated
both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical analyses based
on the master equation model solved by the variational method
have indicated that all the pulse parameters of the laser output will
exhibit complicated slow periodic variations in the asynchronous
soliton modelocking (ASM) mode. New experimental methods
based on analyzing directly the RF spectra of the ASM laser
output have been developed to accurately determine the sinusoidal
variation of the pulse timing and the pulse center wavelength for
the first time. It is found that the pulse center wavelength variation
can be as large as 1 nm half-peak-to-peak and the pulse timing
variation can be as large as 3 ps. The consistency among all the
experimental data and theoretical prediction is carefully examined
and the results indicate that the ASM pulse dynamics observed
experimentally are in good agreement with those obtained from
the theoretical analyses.

I. INTRODUCTION
U LTRASHORT optical pulse trains with high repetitionrates are highly desirable in a wide range of applications
including the high speed optical communication [1], ultrafast
optical signal processing [2], [3], supercontinuum generation
[4], [5], optical frequency metrology [6], and many other sci-
entific researches [7]. Over the past few decades, a lot of efforts
have been devoted to the generation of sub-ps pulses with GHz
repetition rates from modelocked fiber lasers. In particular, the
soliton pulse shaping techniques have been employed in mode-
locked fiber lasers by active harmonic modelocking [8], hybrid
modelocking [4], [9], and passive harmonic modelocking [10],
[11]. Recently asynchronous soliton modelocking (ASM) has
been proved to be an effective technique of generating ultra-
short pulses with GHz repetition rate and high supermode-sup-
pression ratio (SMSR) [12]–[14]. By employing an EO phase
modulator driven at the frequency detuned from the cavity har-
monic by 10–65 kHz in the modelocked Er-doped fiber laser,
10 GHz 0.8 ps pulses with the SMSR more than 70 dB have

been successfully demonstrated [14]. Most interestingly, mode-
locked fiber lasers with asynchronous phase modulation exhibit
many unique laser dynamics when compared to normal actively
modelocked fiber lasers. The previous theoretical analyses with
the soliton perturbation theory has shown that, due to the asyn-
chronous phase modulation, both the output pulse timing and
the output pulse center frequency will exhibit slow sinusoidal
variation at a few (or a few tens) kHz [13]. The peak-to-peak
displacement of the sinusoidal variation in the pulse center fre-
quency of a 1 GHz 1 ps asynchronously mode-locked Er-doped
fiber laser wasmeasured to be 5–25GHz by using a Fabry–Pérot
interferometer [12]. However, the characterization of the pulse
timing variation has not been performed experimentally. For
practical purposes, it is crucial to carefully characterize such
periodic variation of the output pulse parameters before one can
actually utilize the ASM fiber lasers in real applications. This is
especially true for those applications which will depend on the
laser pulse timing or the pulse center frequency.
In the present paper, the laser dynamics of a high-repeti-
tion-rate (10 GHz) ultrashort-pulsewidth (0.55 ps) asynchro-
nously harmonic modelocked Er-doped fiber soliton laser are
investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical
analyses based on the master equation model solved by the vari-
ational method have been carried out. The calculation results
indicate that not only the pulse timing and the center frequency,
but also all other pulse parameters such as the pulse energy are
found to exhibit more complicated slow periodic variations than
expected previously. In addition, new experimental techniques
have been developed to measure the sinusoidal variations of
the pulse timing and the pulse center wavelength accurately.
Instead of performing the ultrafast measurement in the time
domain, the output pulse timing variation is characterized
by analyzing directly the RF spectra of the laser output. The
typical half peak-to-peak displacement of the sinusoidal pulse
timing variation is identified to be 3 ps for the studied laser.
Furthermore, by measuring the extra pulse timing variation
introduced by the pulse center wavelength variation through
the group velocity dispersion (GVD) of an external optical
fiber section, the corresponding half peak-to-peak displacement
of the sinusoidal pulse center wavelength variation can be
identified to be 1 nm. We believe this is for the first time
that the variation of these two pulse parameters for an ASM
fiber laser is determined accurately from direct experimental
data. The connection among the experimental results of the
asynchronously modelocked Er-doped fiber laser, including
the pulsewidth, the optical spectrum, and the pulse center
wavelength variation, are carefully examined. We find that the
ASM pulse dynamics observed experimentally are in good
agreement with those obtained from the theoretical analyses.

the fundamental cavity frequency is only 8.3 MHz, it is not
easy to make direct observation of the supermode hopping in
the optical domain experimentally. The experimental results
described above indicate that the advantages of ASM are the
shorter pulsewidth and the greater SMSR when compared to
normal harmonic mode-locking. The reasons for these ad-
vantages can be understood and explained briefly as follows.
The combination of the periodic pulse center frequency drift
and the fixed optical filter in ASM is equivalent to the effects
of sliding-frequency guiding filters in soliton communication
systems [16]. The solitons can follow the relative periodic
frequency shift induced by asynchronous phase modulation
because of their nonlinear optical property and thus the center
wavelength of the solitons will oscillate around the spectral
peak of the fixed optical filter. On the other hand, the linear
noises will experience more losses and will be filtered out more.
Hence, the suppression of the supermode noises can be more
effective than that of normal frequency modulation (FM) mod-
elocking. Furthermore the suppression of the noises in ASM
will also enhance the laser stability for a shorter pulsewidth,
which is usually lacked in normal FM modelocking when the
pulsewidth is getting shorter and shorter.
In real experiments, the oscillating laser dynamics of ASM
fiber lasers can not be observed directly in the optical spectra or
the SHG intensity autocorrelation traces due to the long integra-
tion time of the two measurements. However, they can be easily
observed on the RF spectra of the laser output with a smaller
span. Fig. 5 shows the RF spectra of the laser output with a span
of 500-kHz near the 10, 20, 30, and 40 GHz pulse train har-
monics respectively. The evenly spaced sub-frequency compo-
nents near the main pulse train harmonics indicate the existence
of the slow kHz and complicated pulse parameter varia-
tion. The similar sub-frequency components also appear near
DC, which has been utilized for long-term stabilizing the 10
GHz asynchronously modelocked Er-doped fiber laser [15]. In
the following sections, detailed theoretical analyses will be car-
ried out and new measurement methods based on analyzing the
RF spectra of Fig. 5 will be developed to fully characterize the
pulse dynamics of the ASM fiber laser.
III. THEORY OF ASYNCHRONOUS SOLITON MODELOCKING
A. Master Equation of Asynchronous Soliton Modelocking
Under the assumption of small round-trip change, an asyn-
chronously modelocked fiber soliton laser can be described by
the master equation as follows [13], [17]:
(1)
Here is the complex field envelope of the pulse, is the
unsaturated gain, is the gain saturation energy, is the linear
loss, represents the effect of the optical filtering, is group
velocity dispersion, represents the effect of equivalent fast
saturable absorption caused by the polarization additive pulse
modelocking (P-APM), is the self phase modulation coeffi-
cient, is the phase modulation strength, is the angular
modulation frequency, is the number of the cavity round trip,
is the time axis measured in the moving frame propagating at a
specific group velocity along with the pulse, and is the linear
timing walk-off per round-trip due to asynchronous phase mod-
ulation, which can be expressed by
(2)
Here is the deviation frequency between the N-th cavity har-
monic frequency and the modulation frequency . In
the following analyses, the sinusoidal modulation curve of the
phase modulator will be expanded by the Taylor’s series at the
center of the pulse to the second order:
(3)
where
(4)
and
(5)
Such an approximation should be quite accurate since the laser
pulsewidth is much shorter than the modulation time period in
modelocked fiber lasers.
B. Variational Analysis of Asynchronous Soliton Modelocking
The master equation (1) describing ASM can be reformu-
lated as a variational problem and then solved approximately by
assuming a reasonable pulse solution ansatz [18]. In the vari-
ational approach, the Lagrangian corresponding to the master
equation (1) is
(6)

quency; (b) pulse timing; (c) pulse amplitude; (d) pulse energy.
is chosen to be 0.5 ps, which is of the same order with the laser
pulsewidth. The value of is then determined from the known
filter bandwidth (13.5 nm) and the value of is determined
from the estimated cavity average dispersion ps as
well as the cavity length (25m). The values of and are from
the roughly estimated loss and gain of the cavity. The values of
and are estimated from the values of and under the
assumption that the pulse is a chirpless fundamental soliton with
roughly the unit normalized pulsewidth and the unit normalized
amplitude. To be more specific, we have simply set
and required [17]. The value of also can
be estimated based on the above normalization assumption. The
other parameters can be directly estimated from the actual ex-
perimental conditions. In this way, a reasonable set of parame-
ters that correspond to the studied fiber laser can be obtained for
illustrative studies. These numbers should not be very far from
the actual operating conditions of the studied laser. From the ob-
tained plots, one can clearly observe the slow periodic variation
at the deviation frequency as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). The half
peak-to-peak displacement of the pulse center frequency varia-
tion is found to be 125 GHz in Fig. 6(a), corresponding to the
variation of the pulse center wavelength of 1 nm around 1550
nm, and the half peak-to-peak displacement of the pulse timing
is 3 ps in Fig. 6(b). Besides these two parameters, other pulse
parameters are also found to exhibit smaller but more compli-
cated slow periodic variation. In particular the evolution of the
pulse amplitude and the pulse energy are shown in Fig. 6(c) and
(d), respectively, which clearly indicates that the oscillation is
not purely sinusoidal and the components of the higher-order
harmonics of the deviation frequency appear. Direct numerical
simulation of the master equation (1) has also been performed
to verify the obtained results. The direct numerical solution is
based on the finite difference Crank-Nicholsonmethod for prop-
agating a suitably chosen initial pulse along the T-direction till
the stable periodic oscillating solution is reached. The pulse pa-
rameters are then extracted from the numerical pulse solution
for comparison. The ASM oscillating behavior is directly ob-
served and the excellent agreement with the variational solution
has been found. Nevertheless, even though the variational ap-
proach as well the direct numerical solution have been proved
to be very helpful for understanding the steady-state dynamics
of ASM modelocked fiber lasers, they are both under the as-
sumptions of the master equation model (1). In particular, the
cavity round-trip change has been assumed to be small, only the
evolution of a single pulse is considered, and no noise source is
included. Therefore, to investigate the noise dynamics of ASM
modelocked fiber lasers will require a more elaborated theoret-
ical model and will be a good subject of further studies.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF PERIODIC VARIATION
OF THE PULSE PARAMETERS
According to the results obtained from the theoretical
analyses in Section III, all the pulse parameters of the ASM
laser may exhibit the slow periodic variation. We have found
that when the modulation depth of the phase modulator is
not too large, the simulation results indicate that the variation
appearing in the pulse timing and the pulse center frequency
are nearly pure sinusoidal at the deviation frequency . In this
section, new experimental methods based on directly analyzing
the RF spectra of the laser output are developed to directly
characterize the sinusoidal variation of the pulse timing and
pulse center frequency.
A. New Method to Determine the Sinusoidal Variation of
Pulse Timing
With the reasonable assumption that the pulse timing varia-
tion is mainly a simple sinusoidal function at the deviation fre-
quency , the photocurrent from the fast photodiode detecting
the pulse train can be expressed by
(22)
where is the response function of the fast photodiode,
is the pulse intensity, is
the period of the cavity harmonic, is the half peak-to-peak

fiber length is (a) 50 m; (b) 100 m; (c) 200 m; (d) 300 m.
D. Experimental Examination of the Pulse Center Frequency
The experimental setup used to measure the sinusoidal vari-
ation of the pulse center wavelength is shown in Fig. 8. As
the same as the measurement of the pulse timing variation, the
analyses of RF spectra of the laser output are utilized to identify
the pulse timing variation before and after (i.e., and )
the pulse train propagates through an external single mode fiber.
Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 9(a)–(d) are the RF spectra of the pulse train
measured near 10 GHz with a 500-kHz span before and after
propagating through 50-m, 100-m, 200-m, and 300-m SMF-28
fibers, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the peak inten-
sity ratio between the 0th and 1st sub-frequency components is
indeed reduced with increasing fiber length. By comparing the
differences of the RF intensities and , the corresponding
pulse timing variations and are evaluated according to
(25) and represented by the solid squares in Fig. 10. The curve
in Fig. 10 is the fitting curve of in (26) with the parameter
ps for the SMF-28 fiber. The fitting results in-
dicate that the half peak-to-peak displacement of the sinusoidal
pulse center wavelength variation is around 1.12 nm for the
studied ASM laser.
V. DISCUSSION
The ASM laser dynamics have been analyzed theoretically
in Section III and investigated experimentally in Section IV.
Fig. 10. Measurement (square dots) and the fitting curve (solid line) of the net
pulse timing variation ! versus the length of the SMF-28 fiber.
Although the slow periodic variation of the pulse center fre-
quency and the pulse timing do not appear directly in the
experimental optical spectra and SHG autocorrelator traces
presented in Section II, the connection among all the experi-
mental and theoretical results still needs to be carefully checked
for ensuring consistency. According to the SHG autocorrelator
trace in Section II, the measured pulsewidth is 0.55 ps. For
such a pulsewidth, the corresponding transform-limited optical
FWHM bandwidth is 4.58 nm with the assumption
of the pulse shape. Compared to the measured optical
spectrum of the pulses presented in Section II, it implies that
an extra 0.5 nm bandwidth is introduced by the slow periodic
variation of the pulse center wavelength. Theoretically the
broadened optical spectrum caused by the sinusoidal pulse
center wavelength variation can be estimated by calculating the
averaged optical spectrum
(28)
By using nm derived form the pulsewidth
and nm obtained from Section IV, the calculated
FWHM bandwidth of the broadened optical spectrum from (28)
is close to that measured by the optical spectrum analyzer. This
shows that the results obtained from Sections II–IV are consis-
tent and also proves the feasibility of the newmeasurement tech-
niques for identifying the pulse timing variation and the pulse
center frequency variation presented in Section IV.
VI. CONCLUSION
To conclude, the pulse dynamics of a 10 GHz 0.55 ps asyn-
chronouslymode-locked Er-doped fiber soliton lasers have been
carefully investigated both theoretically and experimentally. By
putting the experimental parameters of the studied mode-locked
Er-doped fiber laser into the theoretical formulation, the simula-
tion results have shown that all the ASM pulse parameters will
exhibit complicated slow periodic variation. In order to know
more exactly the magnitudes of the sinusoidal variation for the
ASM pulse timing as well as the pulse center wavelength, new
experimental methods based on analyzing the RF spectra of the

Fiber Dispersion Measurement With a
Swept-Wavelength Pulse Light Source
Siao-Shan Jyu, Shiou-Fong Liu, Wei-Wei Hsiang, and Yinchieh Lai
Abstract—A new fiber dispersion measurement method by
utilizing a periodically swept-wavelength pulse light source is
proposed and demonstrated. The periodic pulse timing variation
of the pulse train induced by wavelength sweeping can be directly
detected by a radio-frequency spectrum analyzer. Experiments
by using an asynchronous mode-locked fiber soliton laser as the
swept-wavelength pulse source have been successfully carried out
to demonstrate the feasibility.

I. INTRODUCTION
F IBER dispersion originates from the combined effects offibermaterial/waveguidedispersionandcancausethelinear
optical pulse broadening effects through the wavelength-depen-
dent group time delay. Fiber dispersion also plays an important
role in many applications of nonlinear fiber optics and ultrafast
fiber optics. In the literature, many dispersion measurement
methods have been demonstrated. They can be roughly classified
into twomaincategories:noninterferometricandinterferometric.
Thetimeofflight(TOF)techniqueandthemodulationphase-shift
(MPS) technique are the most well-known noninterferometric
methods [1]. Some recent schemes using supercontinuum pulse
light sources for broadband measurement are also under this
category [2]. The interferometric category also includes many
subcategories. Temporal interferometry methods and various
spectral interferometry methods with continuous-wave (CW)
narrowband or broadband lights are the most well known ap-
proaches [1], [3]. Some special techniques based on the cavity
resonance effects like the self-seeding laser oscillation method
[4] can also be listed under this category. In general, the noninter-
ferometric methods will have the advantages of setup simplicity
and measurement stability, while the interferometric methods
have themain advantage of higher sensitivity.
Among the above-mentioned approaches, the standard MPS
technique is probably the most commonly used method due to

its simplicity. However, since it will typically require the precise
phasemeasurement of the radio-frequency (RF)modulation sig-
nals through an expensive RF network analyzer, the equipment
cost is higher. In the present work, we propose and demon-
strate a new method of fiber dispersion measurement based on a
periodically swept-wavelength pulse light source. Only the RF
spectral measurement capability is required. The measurement
principles are based on two concepts: 1) Periodic wavelength
sweeping of a pulse train will induce periodic pulse timing vari-
ation; 2) the periodic pulse timing variation of a pulse train can
be directly measured by an RF spectrum analyzer. In this way,
we are able to construct an economic new noninterferometric
method for fiber dispersion measurement.
Inordertodemonstratethefeasibilityof theproposal,a10-GHz
asynchronously mode-locked (ASM) Er-fiber soliton laser we
previously developed has been utilized as the wavelength-swept
pulse source [5]–[7]. Such a mode-locked fiber laser system can
produce slow sinusoidal center wavelength sweeping with the
half peak-to-peak amplitude around 1 nm at the oscillating fre-
quency of several tens of kilohertz (kHz). Preliminary dispersion
measurements have been performed on two types of test fibers,
i.e., large-effective-area fiber (LEAF) and dispersion-compen-
sating fiber (DCF), and comparable results to commercial equip-
ment have been obtained. Directions for further improvement on
measurement sensitivity will also be given.
II. PRINCIPLE
Let us consider a delta function pulse train with slow periodic
timing and amplitude oscillation

The Fourier transform of can be derived in the following
way. First, (1) can be rewritten as:

Since the functions and are slow periodic functions
(with the fundamental frequency ), the final two terms in the
integral can be expanded in Fourier series to obtain

TABLE I
MEASUREMENT RESULTS
results of our dispersion measurement are listed in Table I.
The absolute values of the dispersion parameters for the LEAF
and DCF fibers are estimated to be 4.21 and 111 ps/nm/km,
respectively. The wavelength variation is 0.835 nm and
the original timing variation is 2.74 ps. The timing variations
after the test fibers are 3.05 and 5.16 ps for the LEAF and DCF
fibers. Most importantly, the used fiber lengths are only 380
and 47 m for the two cases. The accuracy of these measurement
values has been checked by comparing with the data from a
commercial equipment (Advantest Q7760). The deviations for
the LEAF and DCF fibers are 9.2% and 6.0%, respectively.
This indicates that the proposed method indeed can measure
the fiber dispersion with good accuracy and sensitivity.
Further improvement on the measurement sensitivity can be
achieved either by further increasing the wavelength oscillation
or by reducing the original timing oscillation . As has
been analyzed in [6], the wavelength variation can be increased
by increasing the modulation depth. For the ASM fiber laser, we
have observed more than 1.0-nm wavelength variation and ex-
pect that several nanometers (nm) may be possible. The original
timing variation can be reduced by reducing the cavity disper-
sion and it may also be possible to reach the sub-ps level.
We have confirmed that the group time delay measurement
uncertainties of our present measurement is in the sub-ps level
( 0.2 ps), comparable to the commercial equipments based on
the MPS method. Since the wavelength variation is 0.835 nm,
this corresponds to the dispersion measurement uncertainty
of 0.24 ps/nm. However, the wavelength resolution of the
present experiment will be less than that of the commercial
equipments (typically around 0.1 nm) due to the larger optical
bandwidth of the ASM laser (2–3 nm). Amplitude variation
due to nonflat spectral responses of the tested devices may also
be taken into account with the general formula developed here.
Another limiting factor for measuring large dispersion is the
pulse overlapping effect. When the adjacent pulses are broad-
ened to strongly overlap, the measured RF harmonic signals
will also be strongly degraded. This effect can be reduced by
using longer ps pulses. On the other hand the minimum de-
tectable group delay is right now limited by the original timing
variation of the ASM laser to the ps level. From Fig. 4(a), the
minimum detectable dispersion-induced group delay is roughly
the group delay of a 100-m SMF with 0.8-nm wavelength
sweeping, which corresponds to the 2.0-ps/nm minimum
detectable dispersion. The value of the minimum detectable
dispersion should be approximately the same between the
tunable wavelength range (from 1545 to 1565 nm) of the ASM
laser, and this lower limit may be more easily overcome by
using different implementation schemes. For example, the pulse
train can be generated by a CWwavelength-scanning laser with
an electrooptic (EO) modulator. This kind of implementation
scheme may provide ways to reduce the setup complexity and
to measure the dispersion over a wide wavelength range.
V. CONCLUSION
We have proposed and demonstrated a new method of fiber
dispersion measurement based only on simple RF spectral mea-
surement with a swept-wavelength pulse light source. By mea-
suring the periodic pulse timing variation before and after the
test fiber with an RF spectrum analyzer, the fiber dispersion can
be determined. This new method should provide an economic
way for measuring fiber dispersion noninterferometrically and
should be potentially useful for fiber communication and ultra-
fast fiber optics applications.

obtain as the starting point. It is thus very desirable to
develop numerically efficient algorithms that can directly
determine the optimal local oscillators for squeezing or
entanglement detection as well as the optimal basis func-
tions for the mode description of quantum solitons.
Recently, experimental observation of squeezed lights
with 10 dB quantum noise reduction from optical para-
metric oscillation processes has been reported [22]. It will
be interesting to see whether the soliton schemes can also
generate and detect large quantum squeezing through
optimization.
In the this Letter we start by developing a theory that can
efficiently determine the true optimum homodyne local
oscillator pulse shape for soliton squeezing detection.
Our theory leads to the discovery of the ‘‘natural’’ internal
squeezing modes that are minimum-uncertainty states. By
thinking in terms of these internal squeezing modes, one
can easily understand why there are intra- and intersoliton
quantum correlations and how to optimally detect the
correlation. Most importantly, based on the theory we
can rigorously prove that the time-multiplexed optical
solitons after nonlinear interaction are indeed quantum
mechanically entangled in the sense that the ‘‘quadrature
components’’ of the specially selected multipartite state
can satisfy the following inseparability criterion: the un-
certainty product of the inferred quadrature components is
below the Heisenberg uncertainty product limit.
We start from the well known QNLSE given below:
@U^
@z
¼ i 1
2
@2U^
@t2
þ iU^yU^ U^ . By assuming the quantum noises
are much less than the mean fields, the linearization ap-
proximation can be justified. The quantum noise part of the
soliton can be described by the following linearized opera-
tor equation:
@u^
@z
¼ i
1
2
@2u^
@t2
þ i2U0
#U0u^þ iU
2
0u^
y: (1)
Here U0ðz; tÞ is the classical solution and u^ðz; tÞ, u^
yðz; tÞ
are the perturbed quantum field operators. In order to
calculate the quantum noises by the back-propagation
method [8], the adjoint system of Eq. (1) is intro-
duced by requiring the inner product of the solutions
of the two systems to be a conserved quantity along z.
Here the definition of the inner product is given
by huAðz; tÞju^ðz; tÞi ¼
R
1
2
½uA#ðz; tÞu^ðz; tÞ þ H:c:*dt. This
leads to the following classical linear adjoint evolution
equation:

@z
¼ i

@2uA
@t2
þ i2U0
#U0u
A + iU20u
A#: (2)
Since both Eqs. (1) and (2) are linear, their solutions can
be formally written as u^ðz; tÞ ¼ Lz 0 - u^ð0; tÞ and
uAðz; tÞ ¼ Az 0 - u
Að0; tÞ. Here Lz 0 and Az 0 are the
formal evolution operators of the two systems (linear and
adjoint) from 0 to z. The symbol - is introduced to remind
us of the fact that these formal linear differential operators
operate on both u^ and u^y. With such compact notations and
by assuming the initial input state is a coherent state, the
detected squeezing ratio after the propagation distance z
can be nicely expressed as
RðzÞ ¼
hA0 z - fðtÞjA0 z - fðtÞi
hfðtÞjfðtÞi
: (3)
Here fðtÞ is the local oscillator pulse used in the homo-
dyne detection, and A0 z - fðtÞ is the back-propagated
local oscillator pulse through the adjoint system.
Mathematically Eq. (3) can be viewed as a functional of
fðtÞ, and the condition for its stationary solutions can be
determined by performing a variation with respect to fðtÞ.
Using the fact that the inner product of two solutions is
conserved along z, one has hA0 z - fðtÞjA0 z - fðtÞi ¼
hfðtÞjLz 0A0 z - fðtÞi. It is then easy to show that the
variational equation .RðzÞ ¼ 0 leads to the following ei-
genvalue problem with the eigenvalue / equal to the
optimum squeezing ratio:
Lz 0A0 z - fðtÞ ¼ /fðtÞ: (4)
Equation (4) is one of the main results in this Letter. It
elegantly describes the necessary condition that the opti-
mal local oscillator pulse shape must satisfy. Since we are
mainly interested in the solution with the globally mini-
mum eigenvalue /, the numerical inverse power method
can be applied to Eq. (4) for iteratively approaching the
eigensolutions we want to find.
It is not difficult to prove that if fðtÞ is the eigenstate of
Lz 0A0 z with the eigenvalue /, then i # fðtÞ is also the
eigenstate of Lz 0A0 z with the eigenvalue 1=/. This
implies that if one uses fðtÞ as the basis to project out the
corresponding internal mode field operator a^ðzÞ ¼R
f#ðtÞu^ðz; tÞdt=
R
jfðtÞj2dt, the projected mode will be a
minimum-uncertainty state with one quadrature squeezed
and the other quadrature antisqueezed. So the results in
Eq. (4) physically imply that the minimum-uncertainty
state requirement is the necessary condition to achieve
optimum squeezing detection. This is a very meaningful
result that can provide us with deeper physical insights
about the internal squeezing modes of the solitons. This set
of internal modes is the natural basis set for describing the
quantum noise properties of the soliton, in the sense that
there is no quantum correlation among these internal
modes. This can be easily seen from the formula for
calculating the quantum correlation of two measured op-
erators by the homodyne detection: C12ðzÞ / hA0 z -
f1ðtÞjA0 z - f2ðtÞi, where f1ðtÞ and f2ðtÞ are the two local
oscillator functions.
With the above physical insights, we now demonstrate
how to determine the optimum local oscillator pulse shapes
for detecting entanglement. To illustrate, let us consider the

able range of current technologies. The impacts of fiber
losses on the achievable squeezing or entanglement for
given local oscillators can be readily calculated by the
back-propagation method [8]. Determination of the opti-
mal local oscillator in the presence of fiber losses should
also be possible with some further development of the
theory. The theory developed here should also be appli-
cable to the study of Bose-Einstein condensates. However,
in contrast to the traditional soliton perturbation theory or
the Bose-Einstein condensation Bogoliubov–de Gennes
equation approach based on the perturbed nonlinear
Schro¨dinger equation [4], the expansion eigenmodes em-
ployed in this Letter are not the (generalized) eigenmodes
of the perturbed nonlinear equation itself. Instead, they are
the eigenmodes of the cascaded (linearizedþ adjoint) evo-
lution operators for a fixed propagation length.
In conclusion, we have presented an elegant theory to
rigorously prove that multipartite entangled states can be
directly generated by time-multiplexed solitons. The en-
tanglement can only be detected by using specially chosen
homodyne local oscillators to project out the correspond-
ing quadrature components of the solitons. The optimum
detection functions are related to the internal modes of the
soliton systems, under which all the modes are uncorre-
lated minimum-uncertainty states. The presented theory
provides the way to find the optimum local oscillator pulse
shapes for detecting intra- and intersoliton entanglements
and helps to clarify the physical origin of the entanglement.
The theoretical concept is general and should be also
applicable to other soliton squeezing and entanglement
schemes. The results presented here are believed to be
helpful for future quantum information experiments that
require larger squeezing or entanglement factors.

tained results for quantum squeezing and correlation are sub-
sequently shown and analyzed in Sec. IV. Finally, a brief
conclusion is given.
II. QUANTIZATION OF SIT SOLITONS
In this section, we begin our studies by deriving the valid
quantum operator equations for the SIT soliton system. In the
Heisenberg picture, the sfine-graind interaction Hamiltonian
of ensemble two-level atoms with a traveling-wave light
field can be written as
Hint = iKo
j
hUˆ †sz j,tdpˆ jstd − pˆ j
†stdUˆ sz j,tdj . s1d
Here Uˆ sz j , td is the senveloped light field operator, pˆ jstd is the
dipole moment operator of the jth atom at position z j, and K
is the coupling constant between the light filed and the at-
oms. For simplicity, a one-dimensional identical atomic dis-
tribution and a single polarization light resonant with the
atoms have been assumed. From basic quantum optics, the
atomic operators obey the following commutation relations:
fpˆ j, pˆ j
†g = − nˆ j , s2d
fpˆ j
†
, nˆ jg = − 2pˆ j
†
, s3d
fpˆ j, nˆ jg = 2pˆ j . s4d
Here nˆ j is the population inversion operator of the jth atom.
By defining the coarse-grain-averaged dipole moment and
population inversion density operators according to the fol-
lowing two expressions:
E
z
z+Dz
Pˆ sz,tddz = o
z#zj#z+Dz
pˆ jstd , s5d
E
z
z+Dz
Nˆ sz,tddz = o
z#zj#z+Dz
nˆ jstd , s6d
then one can rewrite the interaction Hamiltonian as follows:
Hint = i"KE
−`
`
hUˆ †sz,tdPˆ sz,td − Pˆ †szdUˆ sz,tdjdz . s7d
This is the coarse-grain-averaged interaction Hamiltonian
suitable for the SIT soliton studies. It is easy to prove that the
dipole moment and population inversion density operators
have to obey following commutation relations:
fPˆ sz1,td,Pˆ †sz2,tdg = − Nˆ sz1,tddsz1 − z2d , s8d
fPˆ †sz1,td,Nˆ sz2,tdg = − 2Pˆ †sz1,tddsz1 − z2d , s9d
fPˆ sz1,td,Nˆ sz2,tdg = 2Pˆ sz1,tddsz1 − z2d . s10d
With above results, the complete Hamiltonian for a traveling
light pulse inside a two-level medium is then given by
H = i"E
−`
`
c
2HUˆ sz,td]Uˆ †sz,td]z − Uˆ †sz,td]Uˆ sz,td]z Jdz
+ i"KE
−`
`
hUˆ †sz,tdPˆ sz,td − Pˆ †sz,tdUˆ sz,tdjdz . s11d
Here c is the light speed in the vacuum. We will require the
light field operator Uˆ sz1 , td to satisfy the following equal-
time commutation relation:
fUˆ sz1,td,Uˆ †sz2,tdg = dsz1 − z2d . s12d
This commutation relation also implies that
eUˆ †sz , tdUˆ sz , tddz has the physical meaning of the photon
number inside the whole light pulse.
From above Hamiltonian and related commutation rela-
tions, one finally arrives at the following quantum operator
evolution equations in the Heisenberg picture:
]Uˆ sz,td
]t
= − c
]Uˆ sz,td
]z
+ KPˆ sz,td , s13d

]Nˆ sz,td
]t
= − 2KhPˆ †sz,tdUˆ sz,td + Uˆ †sz,tdPˆ sz,tdj . s15d
These equations model the quantum effects of decayless en-
semble atoms rigorously and will be the starting point of our
quantum noise calculation. To further simplify the notation,
the evolution equations can be cast into the following nor-
malized form by introducing suitable normalization units:
]Uˆ sz,td

]Nˆ sz,td
]t
= − hPˆ †sz,tdUˆ sz,td + Uˆ †sz,tdPˆ sz,tdj . s18d
Here the normalization units for hPˆ sz1 , td, Pˆ †sz2 , td, Nˆ sz2 , tdj
have been chosen to be the density of atoms Na, the normal-
ization units t0 for time t and u0 for light field hUˆ sz , td,
Uˆ †sz , tdj have been chosen to satisfy the following require-
ment: Ku0t0=1 /2. The normalization units z0 for position z
have been chosen to be ct0. Finally, the normalized coupling
coefficient r=2KNat0 /u0=Na /u0

has a simple physical meaning: the ratio between the atom
density Na and the photon number density units u0
2 ssince
np=u0
2z0 is the normalization units for the photon numberd.
Under such a normalization scheme, the commutation rela-
tions for all the operators now become

measurement operator at time t= te by the homodyne detec-
tion:
Mˆ sted = E

`

one can simply backpropagate the adjoint system from t= te
to t= tb with the initial conditions at t= te given by uAsz , ted
= fLszd, pAsz , ted=0, and nAsz , ted=0. Due to the time conser-
vation of the inner product between the two systems slinear-
ized and adjointd, the measured operator can be rewritten as
Mˆ sted = E

Since all the quantum properties of the operators at the origi-
nal time tb are known, the variance of Mˆ sted can be calcu-
lated according to
VarfMˆ stedg =

upAsz,tbdu2Gdz . s41d
Here we have used the fact that the atoms are in the ground
state at t= tb such that the atomic fluctuations only comes
from the dipole moment fluctuations. The squeezing ratio of
the measurement then is

Equation s42d has an interesting physical implication.
When the atomic characteristic number na si.e., atom number
seen by the solitond is much large than the photonic charac-
teristic number np si.e., one-fourth of the soliton photon
numberd, the contribution from the initial atomic fluctuations
will be reduced by a factor np /na. Physically, this is of
course a signature of the noise averaging effects caused by
the ensemble atoms. We shall also emphasize that the depen-
dence of the quantum squeezing on the atomic density is not
expected from the classical SIT theory and can only be de-
rived by a quantum theory from the fundamental light-atom
interaction Hamiltonian. In classical SIT soliton theories, the
coefficient r=na /np in Eq. s42d can be totally eliminated by
transforming to the moving coordinate and rescale the units
of z. This is not rigorously possible in the quantum theory
developed here.
If the following two operators are measured by two ho-
modyne detectors:
Mˆ 1sted = E

`
ffL1p szduˆsz,ted + fL1szduˆ†sz,tedgdz , s43d
Mˆ 2sted = E
−`
`
ffL2p szduˆsz,ted + fL2szduˆ†sz,tedgdz , s44d
then the corresponding quantum correlation between the two
operators can be calculated according to the following for-
mula:

is to stay at exact resonance, but the output sech soliton pulse
shape is now also position shifted instead of phase shifted
only. This can be expected by the observation that the linear
combination of fnszd and fzszd should be very close to a
position-shifted sech function. Figure 3 shows the detectable
squeezing ratio for different medium lengths and frequency
detunings when the sech local oscillator pulse is both opti-
mally phase shifted and position shifted. The obtained results
in Fig. 3 are almost the same as those in Fig. 1. For com-
parison, in Fig. 4 we show the difference of achievable
squeezing ratio in dB scale between the results in Figs. 1 and
3 si.e., Figs. 1–3d. The squeezing degradation mainly shows
up for the cases under off-resonance condition and long
propagation distance. At resonance, the achievable squeezing
ratio is very close to the soliton part result. In fact, it can be
even a little smaller than the soliton part case due to the fact
that the linear combination of fnszd and fzszd is not exactly a
position-shifted sech function and that the introduced field
continuums may help to improve the squeezing in some
cases. In this way, the required local oscillator can be simply
the sech pulse instead of a much more complicated pulse
shape given by Eq. s51d. This should be the easiest way for
practical experiments to perform the homodyne detection
and the obtained results here should be very useful for help-
ing design future SIT squeezing experiments.
One interesting question here is how much contribution
comes from the initial atomic noises? We find that for all the
soliton cases considered above, the impacts of the initial
atomic noises on the achievable squeezing ratio can be to-
tally ignored, as long as the simulation time window ftb , teg is
large enough to cover almost all the response tails of the
backpropagation. Intuitively, this is because the backpropa-
gated adjoin system solution travels mostly backward outside
the medium and, thus, the left excitation of the dipole mo-
ment part at tb will be very small when tb is early enough in
relative to the collision time. The generation of squeezing in
these cases is thus mainly through the nonlinear mediation of
the atoms on the optical field. This should not be true if the
input pulses are not exact solitons.
In our studies, we have also found that two-time-
multiplexed SIT solitons can become quantum correlated
through the mediation of the atomic medium. The photon
number correlation can be very large if the two in-phase
solitons are close to each other and the propagation distance
is long enough, just as the NLS solitons in optical fibers f24g.
Figure 5 shows an illustration on how to establish the quan-
tum correlations between two SIT solitons by varying the
separation td. After passing through the atomic media, we
calculate the quantum correlations of the photon number op-
erators between the soliton pair. In Fig. 6, we show that a
certain degree of quantum correlation in photon numbers can
be established when the two solitons are in phase. The quan-
tum correlation increases as the separation decreases due to
stronger overlapping. It also increases as the propagation dis-
tance increases due to accumulated nonlinear effects. A more
interesting result found is the situation when the two solitons
are almost nonoverlapping si.e., td=20d. One will expect that
some quantum correlations may still get established through
the long-live atomic perturbations. The following cases of
number-number, number-phase, phase-number, and phase-
phase correlations are more interesting and unexpected. Fig-
ure 7 shows the dependence of all the four quantum correla-
tions as functions of the propagation distance when the two

1. Introduction 
 
Ultra-short optical pulse trains with high repetition rates are very important for many important applications. Rational 
harmonic mode-locking (RHML) is one of the effective techniques to generate high-repetition-rate short pulses from 
fiber lasers [1-4]. However, typical RHML fiber lasers suffer from the un-equal pulse amplitudes caused by the 
rational mode-locking mechanism, which can be clearly seen in the RF spectrum with obvious un-wanted harmonic 
frequency components. On the other hand, asynchronous soliton mode-locking (ASM) lasers have been proved to be 
an effective technique of generating ultrashort pulses with high repetition rates and high 
Super-Mode-Suppression-Ratio (SMSR) [5-6]. In one of our previous works we have investigated both theoretically 
and experimentally the properties of a high-repetition-rate (10 GHz) ultrashort-pulsewidth (0.55 ps) asynchronously 
harmonic mode-locked Er-fiber soliton laser [7]. In this study, we further demonstrate the new possibility of 
combining the RHML and ASM mechanisms. By detuning the frequency of modulation with a fraction of the cavity 
fundamental frequency plus some deviation frequency from the chosen harmonic frequency, the new asynchronous 
rational harmonic mode-locking (ARHML) operation state can be observed. We find the output pulse train can 
advantageously have a wider optical spectrum and very uniform amplitudes with the un-wanted harmonic frequency 
components highly suppressed. 
 
2. Experiment 
 
The experimental fiber laser setup is shown in Fig.1 [5]. The fiber laser consists of a 5.5-m long Er-doped fiber, an 
output coupler, two wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) couplers, two polarizer controllers, a LiNbO3 phase 
modulator, a polarizer, a tunable optical filter with FWHM=13.5nm, and two 980-nm pump laser diodes. The average 
cavity length is estimated to be 24.8 m and the fundamental cavity frequency (fc) is 8.3MHz. A synthesizer is used to 
provide the RF signals which are amplified to 29 dBm for driving the phase modulator.

mode-locking operation for an Er-fiber laser. In comparison to traditional rational harmonic mode-locked (RHML) 
lasers, this new mode of mode-locking can suppress the un-wanted harmonic components more completely. 
Moreover, the 2.4nm FWHM of asynchronous rational harmonic mode-locking is also wider than the obtained 
optical bandwidth when the same laser is operated under normal rational harmonic mode-locking. This kind of new 
rational harmonic mode-locking techniques should be very promising for generating uniform ultra-short pulse trains 
at very high pulse repetition rates.

 spectrum bandwidth is 45 nm.  We recognize that the 
optical spectrum obtained in our laser is relatively wider 
than typical mode-locked single mode Er-doped fiber 
lasers. This is resulted from the high third order 
nonlinearity of the 400 m long single mode fiber. The 
resulted 45 nm bandwidth from our simple laser 
configuration already can approach the 50 nm bandwidth 
performance of the reported frequency comb fiber laser 
[8].  
Based on the parameters of a 500 kHz repetition rate, 
1.87 ns pulse width and 3.27 mW average power, we 
estimated the peak power of the laser output is about 3.5 
W.  Besides, judging from the observed wide optical 
bandwidth, it should be possible to further compress the 
output pulses for achieving shorter pulse-width and 
higher peak power.

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
We have investigated a passive mode-locked all-fiber 
Er-doped fiber laser operated with large net anomalous 
dispersion as well as large net nonlinearity. Over 400 m 
single mode fibers have been added in the laser cavity to 
generate stable wave breaking free pulses with a low 
pulse repetition rate of 500 kHz and a wide, flat optical 
spectrum of 45 nm.  This fiber laser configuration may 
be further applied to chirped pulse amplification systems 
without resorting to pulse stretchers and pulse pickers.

 Abstract-- A self-Q-switched mode-locked Er-doped fiber 
laser with 500-kHz low mode-locking repetition-rate and 
peculiar self-similar-like optical spectrum has been 
experimentally demonstrated. This new operation state may 
be useful for generating high-peak-power pulses from Er-
doped fiber lasers. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
For the past two decades, passive mode-locked Erbium 
doped fiber lasers have been intensively investigated for 
producing stable, compact and maintenance-free 
ultrashort pulses light sources [1].  In order to generate 
high peak power pulses, the Q-switched mode-locked 
(QML) technique is an efficient method through reducing 
the effective pulse repetition rate [2-5].  With a saturable 
absorber inside the cavity, the self-QML pulses can 
usually be experimentally observed in solid state lasers 
before complete CW-mode-locking is reached [3].  
Additional active devices like an acoustic modulator 
(AOM) can also be inserted inside the fiber laser cavity to 
produce QML pulses [4]. With mode field mismatch, the 
passive all fiber Q-switched laser can be carried out [5]. 
In this work, stable self-QML pulses with peculiar self-
similar-like optical spectrum are experimentally observed 
in an all-fiber Er-doped fiber laser with 500 kHz low 
mode-locking repetition-rate and 2.24kHz Q-switched 
repetititon rate. The experimental observation suggests a 
new operation state of Er-doped fiber lasers and may be 
useful for generating high-peak-power pulses for 
practical applications. 
II.  EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
The self-QML pulses are generated in an Erbium-doped 
fiber ring laser in which the polarization additive pulse 
mode (PAPM) technique is employed for achieving 
mode-locking and Er-doped fiber as saturation absorber 
for Q-switched. An intracavity polarization-dependent 
isolator is used to ensure unidirectional laser operation 
and also as part of the mode-locking module.  A laser 
diode with center wavelength of 980 nm is used to pump 
the Er-doped single-mode gain fiber through a 
wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) coupler.  The 
Er-fiber is very highly doped erbium fiber and the 
absorption coefficient is 80 dB/m @ 1530 nm.  Over   
400 m of single mode fiber is used inside the laser cavity 
to reduce the mode-locking repetition rate and to provide 
large dispersion and high nonlinearity.  The mode-locked 
pulse train is coupled out through a 90/10 output coupler. 
The laser output is connected to an oscilloscope (LeCroy 
Wave Surfer 62 Xs, bandwidth 650 MHz) or an optical 
spectrum analyzer (ADVANTEST Q8384) for 
monitoring and measurements. 
III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Stable Q-switched mode-locked (QML) pulses can be 
generated after properly rotating the angles of the 
polarization controllers (PCs).  At a suitable pump power, 
the QML pulse train shown in Fig. 1(a) is observed. The 
time spacing between adjacent Q-switched envelopes is 
about 446 µs, corresponding to a 2.24 kHz repetition rate.   
Figure 1(b) reveals the expanded symmetric single Q-
switched envelope. Inside the envelope, the mode-locked 
pulses with a 500 KHz repetition rate can also be 
obviously seen.  The time trace of a single mode-locked 
pulse is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), from which the 
pulse width is estimated to be below 7 ns.
