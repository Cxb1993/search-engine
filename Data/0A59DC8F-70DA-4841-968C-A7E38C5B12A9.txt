2. 計畫架構 
要完成智慧型生態社區 Eco-Community，首要之務便是無線感測網路的佈建與資料的蒐集(如
溫度、濕度等)，搭配資料整合，將龐大的數據轉成有用的資訊。然而，盲目而隨意的設置感測器，
並無法確切取得最需要的資訊，反而會造成系統的負荷。因此，我們必頇考慮人們活動，搭配建
築思維，在適當的地方設置感應器以擷取資料，並且安裝適當的設備。此外，有了這些資訊和設
備，我們還必頇結合有效的控制方法來驅動這些裝置，加以調節環境。因此，整合本計畫所提出
的四個子計畫，能夠在適當的地方感測各種資訊，並自動啟動設備做出相對應的調節，讓生活、
辦公的環境更加舒適宜人，進而成為真正的智慧型生態社區：Eco-Community。 
本計畫中的四項子計畫環環相扣、相輔相成(請參見圖 1)。智慧型社區模型提供無線感測網路
適當的建物與人車分佈拓樸，讓感測器所取得的數據資料，能夠確切掌握人們活動範圍的環境變
化；而無線感測網路將蒐集到的數據交由後端的控制系統分析，並且根據當時環境狀態以及智慧
型建築所提供人們對環境舒適度的相關資訊，透過實境與虛境互動平台發送指令，驅動設備，讓
各項裝置可以達到預期的環境調節功能。然而，這樣的環境調節也許並未能符合人們的預期與需
求，因此，控制端會將人們手動調節裝置的資訊整合交給智慧型社區模型，再加上無線感測網路
所蒐集的當時之環境資訊，加以分析、學習，讓智慧型社區模型能夠達到更高的生活舒適滿意度，
以及給予控制系統更準確、更符合預期且兼顧生態概念的資訊。 
 
式，在社區裡，白天青壯年的居民大多外出工作，社區中僅會留下年長與年幼的居民，然而年長
與年幼的人通常比較需要被照顧，如果白天居民可以利用本身的力量互相照顧，將可以大幅減少
社會成本的浪費與額外的支出。 
為了達到上述的目的，本子計畫擬完成下述四個項目。 
(1) 建構以社群為中心的無線感測網路定位服務系統 
定位在未來生活中扮演相當重要的角色，只有透過定位才可以進行位置相關的服務。社
區住戶身上攜帶配備有符合規格的無線感測裝置，在社區空曠處可以接收到 GPS 定位訊號，
可以利用現行 GPS 定位方式進行定位，然而在 GPS 遮蔽處之室內及室外環境中，我們將在
無線感測網路平台設計與實作一套定位系統。有了社區住戶、物件的位置資訊將可以成為互
動式智慧型社區之創新應用的重要根基。 
(2) 建構以無線感測網路定位服務系統為基礎的社區管理服務系統 
透過社區住戶定位系統所即時更新的住戶位置資訊，社區管理服務系統可以清楚了解每
個社區住戶的即時所在位置，當社區住戶有需要服務或是緊急狀況時，社區住戶的位置就會
是一個非常有用的資訊，透過此資訊，本系統可以提供許多不同的創新社區管理服務。 
(3) 建構以無線感測網路定位服務系統為基礎之導引系統 
導引系統與傳統導航系統不同的地方在於，傳統導航系統是透過靜態資料庫存放目的地
資訊，然後利用定位系統協助，計算出一條路徑供使用者參考，但是因為導航系統只有靜態
資訊，無法得知動態的即時資訊，因此所提供的路徑都是固定的，無法隨著環境的改變，給
予不同的服務。而本系設計之導引系統將連接社區之無線感測網路，透過動態即時資訊與靜
態資料庫的結合，能夠依據目前社區的狀況導引使用者到正確的位置。 
(4) 建構以無線感測網路服務系統為基礎之健康照護系統 
本計畫將設計出一個妥善職能照顧的老人養生村：本計畫可搭配智慧型的無線監控系
統，依據使用者的心脈律動及體溫變化等生理變化，透過社區網路連結，適時通知社區周遭
醫療體系。若監控系統查知使用者有劇烈生理變化，急需醫療救治，感測器利用無線的方式
將病患生理資料傳回到中央控制伺服器，中央控制伺服器會根據這些資料，以及病患之前就
診記錄，來做出一個適當的決策通知醫療團隊，達到醫療零時差的病患照顧。 
 
子計畫三：感測網路之通訊及感測資料處理技術 
為了建立一個智慧型生態社區，我們需要使用相當數量的感測器和其他裝置組成感測網路，
藉由這些感測器節點收集環境資訊並加以利用，發展出各種便利的應用。所以，感測網路是整個
計畫的基礎，必頇建立一套穩定、有效率且牢固的感測網路，才能更有效率、更準確地提供各種
服務。一套好的感測網路必頇考慮許多因素，如感測器佈點位置、網路初始化步驟以及節點間通
訊所使用的網路協定，每個環節都必頇相互呼應才能成就一套好的系統。另外，在我們的網路中
可能會有手機、PDA 等裝置，因此異質網路間的通訊也是必頇考慮的重點。 
為了達到上述的目的，本子計畫擬完成下述三個項目。 
(1) 網路佈建與初始化 
在感測網路初始化的階段希望做到叢聚化(Clustering)和階層化(Hierarchical)的網路架
構。叢聚化能有效的壓縮與整合訊息，可節省訊息傳送的資料量，避免過多的訊息傳送造成
的碰撞，造成訊息遺失，也可以節省電力的耗損，讓感測器的壽命延長。階層化的目的是為
了能夠善用各種不同的感測節點特性，讓一些耗損能量較多的節點能夠減緩其耗損能量的速
度，達到系統的穩定。 
覺上的、聽覺上的及文字上的。 
(5) 評估實境使用者與虛境使用者之間的社交社群互動模式 
我們也希望分別針對實境使用者與虛境使用者，對於不同的互動模式，從使用者角度所
可能產生不同程度的感受性、融入性、動機進行評估，以瞭解實境與虛境相對應於不同的互
動模式中的使用者的反應，並作為此系統後續設計與改進的重要依據。 
 
 
二、重要執行成果及價值 
1. 實境平台 
 Google Maps 平台 
我們在 Google Maps 上建立我們的介面，營造一個虛擬社區，以利我們能以最簡單且直接的
方式，對這社區中的任何事物要求我們想知道的相關資訊，甚至可以遠端操縱設備。在這個平台
上，我們建立了資料庫系統平台，其他應用可以此平台為基礎作應用。 
 社區環境監控平台 
我們建立了一個社區環境監控平台，可作環境的監控，如光度、溫度與濕度。圖 2 與 3 為社
區環境監控的平台，分別為室外與室內的環境。感測節點偵測到的資料藉由 Multihop 傳回，利用
我們設計出適用於目前網路環境的 MAC 及感測網路路由協定，來提高傳遞效率。 
 
  
圖 2 社區環境監控平台(室外)               圖 3 社區環境監控平台(室內) 
 
 定位技術 
我們藉由手持裝置上內嵌的微電子機械元件，提升原有定位系統的精準度，並整合不同的定
位系統，以提供一個無所不在的定位服務系統。我們利用 GPS、IMU 與 RF，再經由 Kalman Filter
整合，以得到精準的位置資訊。GPS 主要是用在室外定位。而利用 IMU 內的三軸加速度計與三軸
磁力計的資料，可以得到相對的位移以及絕對的方向。RF 定位則是即時反應環境中訊號變化的情
形，有效率地判斷出使用者靠近於哪些參考點，判斷使用者可能的所在位置，主要是用在室內定
位。最後是使用 Kalman Filter 來整合 GPS、RF 定位以及慣性感測元件的定位資訊，提供一個高
精確的絕對位置。室內外定位的精確度請見圖 4 與 5，其中藍線為真實路徑、綠線為 GPS 軌跡、
紅線則為利用慣性感測元件所得到的軌跡。 
 
溫度越高的時候，所產生的回饋就會比較小，當溫度越低，所產生的回饋就越大，也就越難鼓動
鼓風器。當鼓風器開始有氣流時，Wonderland 會傳送一個訊號給電風扇風速的控制器，氣流越大，
電風扇的轉速也越快，反之則越慢。圖 7 顯示我們將感測器佈建在工程五館的示意圖。

3. 創新應用 
 個人導航系統 
我們開發個人導航系統並在其上實現了以位置為基礎的服務。系統架構包含 Server端和 Client
端。Server 端主要是以 Google Maps 為基礎，在上面建立圖資，顯示相關區域景點和建築等，並
顯示使用者的移動情況和所在行經路線的景點資訊。資料庫中儲存景點的位置、相關介紹資訊，
建築的位置、圖資，供使用者使用定位系統查詢相關資料。Client 端配備有 IMU、以高精準的三
軸加速度計和三軸磁力計測量提供相對位置，Client 端還配有 GPS，提供絕對位置。室外及室內
的以位置為基礎的服務請見圖 8 與 9。

 虛擬運動場 
目前已經能夠初步掌握 Wonderland 模組的繪製以及物件的位置控制、人物模組的控制，並且
能夠將感測器接收到的資料反應在 Wonderland 的虛擬世界之中。利用感測器控制在 Wonderland
之中的物件移動，可以根據感測器移動向量來決定物體該往何處移動，並且知道該移動多少距離，
當然也可以做到在社區住戶勞累一天之後，不想外出運動，就可以利用家中的設備和感測器做一
些休閒活動，利如跑步、舉啞鈴、仰臥起坐等，配合 Wonderland 裡面的人物動作及場景音樂效果，
達到放鬆身心的休閒娛樂，並且有運動的效果。圖 14 顯示虛擬運動場的介面。 
 
 
圖 14 虛擬運動場 
 
 My 太極 Book 
近年來以網頁為基礎的社交網路，如 YouTube、Blogger、Windows Live、Facebook 與 Twitter
等，引起了廣泛的注意。透過這些社交網路，使用者可以很容易地與朋友分享相片、影片、文章
與訊息。然而這些社交網路是虛擬的，若我們能結合實體的 MEMS 設備與無線感測網路，便能在
虛擬的世界裡做實體的互動。我們利用 Body Sensor Network 為基礎的(BSN-based)社群式網路活
動，來發展社群式網路應用服務元件，讓數量龐大且分佈在各區域的社區使用者，可以打破時間
空間上的限制、透過智慧型終端裝置，互相分享、從事共同的運動、分享醫療方面的生理狀態等。
我們展示了太極運動社群之成果，圖 15 為其在 Facebook 上的介面。

(2) 停車位監控系統 
a、 實作出停車位監控系統，使用者可以利用此系統得知停車場可用停車位的數量資訊，方
便使用者找到停車位。 
b、 可協助快速找到可用的停車位，避免使用者自行搜尋停車位所造成的油耗。 
 
子計畫三：感測網路之通訊及感測資料處理技術 
(1) 感測網路 MAC 協定設計 
a、 已設計出合適的 MAC，可適用於目前所需之應用。 
b、 設計具有省電效果且容易實作在真實感測器上的 MAC。

(3) 智慧型手機與社區的結合 
a、 使用者可以因應環境的變化，藉由搖晃手機來傳遞訊息。 
b、 手機可透過通訊網路將訊息傳送至社區伺服器。 
 
子計畫四：建構交叉實境互動平台 
(1) 交叉實境平台的建立 
a、 完成中央大學資工系工程五館室內 Octopus 無線感測網路建構。 
b、 熟悉 Wonderland 的使用，並結合數位美術設計人員，以軟體建構縮尺寸之模擬社區，並
以動畫技術(雲霧、火焰等)具體視覺化環境參數於虛擬社區中。 
c、 以虛擬大廳來展示交叉實境虛擬互動社群平台架構。 
(2) 感測器的應用 
a、 以多個感測器實作出 Body Sensor Network，以太極運動來展示虛擬互動社群平台架構。 
 
2. 未來執行重點 
子計畫一：建構 Google Earth 上的虛境及實境互動式平台 
針對目前的成果，我們需要改進的部分主要為增加定位的準確性，這或許可以利用更佳的坐
標演算法增加準確性，同時感測器的精準度也會隨著硬體技術的精進而增加，這也會大大地增加
我們的定位準確性。另外，也可以考慮藉由多種感測器的合作來增加準確性，因為多個感測器的
使用，增加可參考的資料量，所以定位系統可以參考的資料樣本增加，準確性也會有所提升。有
了精確的定位資訊之後，再開發出更多與位置相關的應用。 
未來的目標主要是著重在網路和手持裝置的管理和維護，如考慮到每個使用者的活動範圍，
通常會固定在某些區塊行動，故我們可以將感測器的設置位置最佳化；再者，當區塊內的使用者
人數有變化，或者是使用者的身分為單車、機車或汽車，我們需要更改資料收集的頻率，讓感測
網路可以更有效地收集到資料；此外，如手持裝置的管理：當使用者在社區行動，感測器對手持
裝置作感測，並將所得資訊回傳給後端伺服器，由伺服器判斷此使用者的行動是否合理，也可以
有效掌握到手持裝置的位置和狀況；利用有效的資料整合與壓縮，將可以有效減少感網路流量以
子計畫四：建構交叉實境互動平台 
未來將佈建室外無線感測器網路、建立行動式交叉實境互動平台、建立精確定位機制，讓實
體使用者能夠以虛擬分身在虛擬社區中與其他虛擬玩家互動。 
此外，研究並設計人因量表，量測以使用者為中心對於視覺上的互動、聽覺上的互動、文字
上的互動以及虛擬介面使用上的感受性，這包括了視覺或聽覺舒適度、系統的功能性和使用性的
評估；更進一步，研究並設計存在量表，量測並比較使用者置身於實境以及虛境的融入性，並藉
此評估使用者繼續使用此一平台之動機的強烈程度。還有，進行真人實驗，以評估實境使用者與
虛境使用者對於不同互動模式(視覺、聽覺、文字)的反應，並比較使用者對於資訊視覺化的反應，
以做為系統改善的方向。 
 
 
四、計畫之實際執行情形與預期工作之差異分析 
1. Google Maps 與 Google Earth 
Google Maps 與 Google Earth 皆為 Google 公司所提供的服務，兩者的商業模式有所不同，然
而大致上說來都提供免費的地圖服務與開放的 API，掀起了公眾參與地理資訊系統的熱潮，因此，
提供了個人加值或是企業加值的空間。Google Maps 與 Google Earth 共用 KML 地標資訊，在資料
的轉換上難度不高。使用 Google Earth 瀏覽地圖，較為順暢，但其所提供的地理資訊較少；而使
用 Google Maps 來瀏覽地圖，則顯示速度略為緩慢，但是資訊較為豐富。也因此，在初步的開發
上，我們選擇圖資較為豐富且使用率較高的 Google Maps 來當作開發與顯示的平台。 
 
2. Wonderland 與 Second Life 
本計畫原先預定用 Second Life 來當作虛境的平台，然而在 Second Life 中租借一塊虛境需要
每年固定付費給其公司，耗費相當大的維護資金，且若是要使用 Second Life 作為虛境顯示介面，
使用者端必頇要額外安裝其他程式才能使用，所以我們虛境的部分不採用 Second Life 為顯示虛境
的介面。因此，我們採用了使用者端只要能夠執行 JAVA 的程式就可以使用的 Wonderland Project，
雖然沒有營利公司為其撐腰，但表現一點也不遜色。而其又為 Open Source，故為一經濟的解決方
案。Wonderland 以 Dark Star 為基礎，再加上 Voice Bridge 和一些其他的應用程式伺服器所構成，
3D 圖型主要以 JME (JAVA 以 OpenGL 為核心繪制 3D 物件的引擎)來繪製我們所要的物件，感測
器的資料或是其他設備上的感測裝置(如 G-Sensor)可以透過網路傳輸 UDP 的協定將資料傳送到
Wonderland 之中，並且可以看到使用者感測資料顯示在虛擬環境之中。 
 
 
五、早期參與廠商績效 
目前正與工研院討論技轉的相關事宜。 
 
 
六、目前所遭遇之困難與因應對策 
Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Redundancy for
RFID Data Cleansing
ABSTRACT
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies are used in
many applications for data collection. However, raw RFID read-
ings are usually of low quality and may contain many anomalies.
An ideal solution for RFID data cleansing should address the fol-
lowing issues. First, in many applications, duplicate readings (by
multiple readers simultaneously or by a single reader over a period
of time) of the same object are very common. The solution should
take advantage of the resulting data redundancy for data cleaning.
Second, prior knowledge about the readers and the environment
(e.g., prior data distribution, false negative rates of readers) may
help improve data quality and remove data anomalies, and a de-
sired solution must be able to quantify the degree of uncertainty
based on such knowledge. Third, the solution should take advan-
tage of given constraints in target applications (e.g., the number
of objects in a same location cannot exceed a given value) to ele-
vate the accuracy of data cleansing. There are a number of exist-
ing RFID data cleansing techniques. However, none of them sup-
port all the aforementioned features. In this paper we propose a
Bayesian inference based approach for cleaning RFID raw data.
Our approach takes full advantage of data redundancy. To cap-
ture the likelihood, we design an n-state detection model and for-
mally prove that the 3-state model can maximize the system per-
formance. Moreover, in order to sample from the posterior, we
devise a Metropolis-Hastings sampler with Constraints (MH-C),
which incorporates constraint management to clean RFID raw data
with high efficiency and accuracy. We validate our solution with a
common RFID application and demonstrate the advantages of our
approach through extensive simulations.
1. INTRODUCTION
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an electronic tagging
technology that allows objects to be automatically identified at a
distance without a direct line-of-sight, using an electromagnetic
challenge/response exchange [27]. An increasing number of major
retailers such as Wal-Mart, The Home Depot, Kroger, and Costco
have installed RFID based inventory management systems in their
warehouses and distribution centers. However, practitioners are

facing a challenging problem: the raw data collected by RFID
readers are inherently unreliable [23, 17]. Therefore, middleware
systems [16] are required to correct readings and provide cleansed
data. Most previous solutions [11, 17, 21, 15, 8] for cleansing RFID
raw data focused on smoothing the readings generated by a group
of readers. However, these existing solutions suffer from three ma-
jor limitations:
• Data redundancy introduced by overlapping detection regions
of multiple stationary readers (spatial redundancy) or contin-
uous readings over time of a single mobile reader (temporal
redundancy) is not utilized to improve reading accuracy.
• Prior knowledge about tagged objects and RFID readers is
not effectively utilized to improve reading accuracy.
• Constraints in target applications (e.g., the maximal capacity
of a room or a shelf) are not effectively utilized to cleanse the
data.
In this paper, we propose a method to address these limitations.
We focus on taking full advantage of data redundancy, prior knowl-
edge, and application constraints to elevate the accuracy of data
cleansing.
1.1 Data Redundancy
Two types of redundancy may arise in RFID related applications:
spatial redundancy, where an object is detected by multiple readers
in its neighborhood, and temporal redundancy, where an object is
detected multiple times by a single reader over time.

2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
In this section, we develop a Bayesian inference-based approach
to handle redundant readings and prior knowledge, and we analyze
the challenges when applying this approach. Table 2 summarizes
the notations used in this section.
2.1 A Bayesian Inference Based Approach
Bayesian inference is a statistical inference technique that es-
timates the probability of a hypothesis (x) based on observations
(y). Bayesian inference shows that posterior is proportional to the
multiplication of likelihood and prior, which can be represented as
p(x|y) ∝ p(y|x)p(x).
Suppose there are m zones and n objects in our monitoring en-
vironment, each zone with a reader mounted in the zone center.
Let oi represent the object with ID i. For each oi, its location is
represented by a random variable hi. Therefore, a possible distri-
bution of n objects in m zones can be denoted as an instance of
the random vector Hˆ = (h1, h2, . . . , hn). hi represents the zone
ID where object oi is in. For example h1 = 2 denotes that object
o1 is in zone 2 in the current instance. For the reader in zone j,
the raw data (0 or 1) it receives from the RFID tag of object oi is
denoted as zij . The raw data matrix for each complete scan from
m readers can then be represented as an n ×m matrix Z = [zij ].
Thus the Bayes’ theorem can be represented as Equation 1, where
post(Hˆ|Z) denotes the posterior probability of location vector Hˆ
given the raw data Z, and a valid hypothesis means the hypothesis
satisfies all constraints:
post(Hˆ|Z) = 0 : Hˆ is not valid
post(Hˆ|Z) > 0 : Hˆ is valid
post(Hˆ1|Z) > post(Hˆ2|Z) : Hˆ1 is more likely than Hˆ2
In particular, if zij = 1 in a raw data matrix and the actual loca-
tion of object oi is not in zone j, then zij is a false positive. Take
Table 1 as an example, at least one of z22 and z23 is a false positive
because object 2 cannot be in zone 2 and zone 3 simultaneously.
Similarly, at least one of z43 and z44 is a false positive.
To compute post(Hˆ|Z), we make some independence assump-
tions of random variables. RFID reader transmissions or tag trans-
missions may lead to collisions because readers and tags communi-
cate over a shared wireless channel. Reader collisions happen when
neighboring readers communicate with a tag simultaneously [9]
and tag collisions occur when multiple tags transmit to a reader
at the same time [10]. However, the two kinds of collisions can be
effectively prevented by arbitration protocols (e.g. by scheduling
adjacent readers to operate at different times) [25, 13, 20]. There-
fore, we assume each reader detects the tags of different objects in-
dependently (i.e., whether a reader can successfully detect the tag
of a certain object does not interfere with whether the reader can
successfully detect that of another object) in this research. Based

on the assumption, we can derive Equation 2.
Furthermore, because we employ MH-C to take into account
constraints (i.e., to ensure that each generated sample satisfies all
the constraints), here we can simply assume independence between
different hi (i.e., the locations of objects). In addition, we assume
that each reader’s detection of the same object is independent. Be-
sides, the prior distribution of each object does not depend on that
of other objects. Therefore, we can obtain Equation 3. If we rewrite
Equation 3 using the normalizing constant, denoted as α, we can
reach Equation 4, which shows how to compute the posterior of
each sample. To be specific, p(zij |hi) reflects the corresponding
likelihood, which is the probability that the reader in zone j reports
the value of zij about object oi given that object oi is actually in
the zone with ID hi. Furthermore, p(hj) denotes the prior proba-
bility that the object oj is in the zone with the ID of hj . The prior
probability can be interpreted as the assumed distribution before
the acquiring of the RFID raw data.
2.2 The Goal and the Obstacles
Based on Equation 4, given the raw readings Z and a hypothesis
Hˆ (the location of each object), we can derive the probability of the
hypothesis. However, finding just one valid hypothesis will provide
nothing more than a biased answer to queries against the uncertain
data. To address this issue, we need to query against all valid hy-
potheses. However, this is unrealistic because there are numerous
valid hypotheses in most cases. Thus, our goal is to create a large
sample set of valid hypotheses, each associated with a weight com-
puted by Equation 4: (Hˆ1, w1), (Hˆ2, w2), · · · , (Hˆn, wn). The
sample set of valid hypotheses as a whole enables us to answer
queries with high credibility. To achieve this goal, we must over-
come the following obstacles:
• A prerequisite for effective hypothesis sampling is to be able
to compute the posterior probability of each hypothesis pre-
cisely. Therefore, we propose the n-state detection model in
Section 3 to capture likelihoods in an affordable and accurate
way.
• The hypothesis space is high dimensional, and the posterior
probability is difficult to sample from. Thus, we need a sam-
pling technique that has desirable efficiency. In Section 5,
we apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) be-
cause MCMC can maintain the correlation between samples,
resulting in an improved sampling efficiency.
• We need to incorporate constraint management in sampling.
We propose a sampler called Metropolis-Hastings sampler
with Constraints (MH-C), which improves the naive Metropolis-
Hastings (MH) sampler. Each sample generated by MH-C
automatically satisfies all the constraints.
3. RFID READER DETECTION MODELS
The major difficulty in computing the posterior of each sam-
ple (Equation 4) lies in how to accurately estimate the likelihood
p(zij |hi). To do so, we introduce the n-state detection model of
RFID readers to capture likelihoods in an affordable and precise
way.
3.1 Physical Characteristics
An RFID reader sends RF signals to communicate with (passive)
tags to retrieve a list of IDs in its detection range. However, RFID
data acquisition and transmission are unreliable [10, 15, 17, 21]. In
our experiments, we investigated the change of the read rate over
distance using regular RFID readers and tags. The results are as

among every 5 successive zones. A formal derivation of the loca-
tion distribution in terms of the probabilistic mass function can be
found in Section 4.
3.4 A Case Study: The 3-State Model
We elaborate on the 3-state model as a case study. Suppose one
reader can only detect its own zone and the two neighboring zones.
This assumption implies that, as for a particular reader, there are
three distinct location-based states of a object: in the same zone as
the reader, in the neighboring zones, and in all the other zones. To
capture this correlation, we have to choose n = 3 and the resulting
model is the 3-state detection model, where the overall detection
range of a reader is divided into two sub-regions, as shown in Fig-
ure 5. Specifically, the major detection region, the minor detection
region and the zero read rate region in Figure 5 correspond to the
zone where the reader locates, neighboring zones and all the other
zones, respectively. Therefore, the motivating scenario (Figure 1),
if interpreted by the 3-state model, can be illustrated in Figure 6.
Figure 5: The 3-state detection model of RFID readers.
In Figure 6, by using the 3-state detection model, not only the
duplicate readings can be incorporated, but also a zone and all its
neighboring zone can be differentiated because they are with dis-
tinct read rates. To be specific, if object oi is in zone j, not only
zij but also zi(j−1) and zi(j+1) should have a considerable chance
to be 1 (false positives). In the meantime, other readers are unable
to detect the tag of object oi. The reason is that object oi may be
in the major detection region of the reader in zone j while it may
be also in the minor detection region of both readers in zones j− 1
and j+1. As for the other readers, object oi is totally beyond their
overall detection regions, leading those readers to report 0 for ob-
ject oi. If we denote the mean value of the read rate in major detec-
tion region as rmajor and the mean value of the read rate in minor
detection region as rminor , the estimate of the likelihood using the
3-state model can be represented in Equation 9 and Equation 10.
p(zij = 1|hi) =
{ rmajor if hi = j
rminor if hi ∈ {j − 1, j + 1}
0 otherwise
(9)
p(zij = 0|hi) =
{ 1− rmajor if hi = j
1− rminor if hi ∈ {j − 1, j + 1}
1 otherwise
(10)
The advantage of the 3-state detection model over the 2-state
detection model can be measured by the system entropy (Section
4). We also answer the question whether having even more states
(more than 3) can further benefit the system.
4. ENTROPY ANALYSIS
We use entropy to measure the uncertainty in a system after in-
valid system states have been eliminated by a data cleansing method.
Generally, applying an efficient data cleansing method will lead
to systems with smaller entropy. In this section, we firstly show
the advantage of the 3-state model over the 2-state model and then
prove that the 3-state model can maximize the system performance
compared with other detection models with even more than 3 states.
A snippet of the RFID raw data is shown in Table 3 and the actual
location of an object i is denoted as a random variable L.
4.1 Entropy versus Read Rate
Entropy of the 2-State model: Suppose that y denotes the read
rate in the 2-state detection model. According to the right side
of Equation 4, the probabilistic mass function of L in the 2-state
model can be represented as:
p(L = l) =
{ α(1− y)y(1− y)β if l = j
α(1− y)(1− y)yβ if l ∈ {j − 1, j + 1}
0 otherwise
(11)
where α is the normalizing constant and β represents the prior
probability (we assume the prior distribution as a uniform distri-
bution) in Equation 4. Thus, we can calculate the entropy of the
distribution of L as:
H(L) = −α(1− y)(1− y)yβ · ln(α(1− y)(1− y)yβ) (12)
−α(1− y)y(1− y)β · ln(α(1− y)y(1− y)β)
−α(1− y)(1− y)yβ · ln(α(1− y)(1− y)yβ)
Because the probabilities on all the locations sum to 1, we can
derive Equation 13. By applying Equation 13 to Equation 12 (α
and β are canceled out), we can obtain Equation 14.

Figure 9: Taking advantage of the correlation between samples
to improve sampling efficiency.
In our design, we choose MCMC instead of other sampling tech-
nique because MCMC maintains the correlation among samples.
In MCMC, the next sample depends on the current sample. Before
we elaborate on how we can take advantage of sample correlation
to improve the efficiency of sampling in our scenario, we define
two terms as follows.
Definition We call any sample generated by the sampler a candi-
date sample. A qualified sample is a candidate sample that satisfies
all constraints.
The existence of constraints leads to the uniqueness of our prob-
lem. Samples must satisfy all the constraints to become qualified.
Note that in most sampling problems, we prefer independent sam-
ples, that is, the current draw of a sample is independent from the
previous draw. In our scenario, however, the sampling techniques
which generate independent samples (e.g., importance sampling)
may suffer from low sampling efficiency due to the loss of corre-
lation between adjacent samples. Figure 9 illustrates how the cor-
relation between samples can be utilized to improve the sampling
efficiency. The qualified sampling space is a subset of the complete
sampling space. Suppose sample point A is the current sample in
the qualified sampling space. For an independent sampler, the next
sample could be any point in the complete sampling space. How-
ever, the next sample is useful only if it happens to fall into the
qualified sampling space. On the contrary, if a MCMC-based sam-
pler is employed, the next sample will be chosen according to the
proposal distribution at point A, i.e., the next sample will be in the
area denoted by the dotted circle centering at point A. Therefore,
compared to other independent samplers, the probability that the
next sample generated by MCMC falls into the qualified sampling
space is considerably increased.
Note that although MCMC improves sampling efficiency, a sam-
ple generated by MCMC may not necessarily be a qualified sample.
As in Figure 9, point B is a sample generated by MCMC after point
A. However, point B is outside the qualified sampling space. Con-
sequently, we have to sample again to acquire point C, which is a
qualified sample, and then add it into the Markov chain as the next
state. Afterward, the Markov chain moves from point A to point
C.
5.3 Metropolis-Hastings Sampler with Con-
straints
Although the naive MH algorithm can evaluate the posterior by
forming a Markov chain in the sampling space, it does not take

constraints into account. If we impose constraints to samples, many
of them should be rejected because they are inapplicable, i.e., they
are not qualified samples.
To incorporate constraints in sampling, we propose a Metropolis-
Hastings sampler with Constraints (MH-C). With MH-C, each zone
is associated with multiple variables called resource descriptors.
The current value of a resource descriptor represents how much the
associated resource is still available. Suppose we have a variable,
denoted as Descriptorzonei , to keep track of the current available
vacancy in zone i. The initial value of Descriptorzonei is set to
the maximal capacity of zone i. Thus, whether an object j with
the volume V olumeobjectj is able to be stored in zone i can be
examined by:
Descriptorzonei = Descriptorzonei − V olumeobjectj (18)
The proposed resource allocation is feasible only ifDescriptorzonei
is no less than zero. Otherwise, we have to re-sample until a new
allocation meets all the constraints. Consequently, the problem of
whether an allocation is feasible (or compatible) can reduce to the
problem of monitoring the value of each descriptor.
With MH-C, because each sample is a Dobject-dimensional vec-
tor, a proposal sample is generated iteratively dimension by dimen-
sion. If any descriptor for the current allocation is less than zero,
there will be no chance for the current partial sample to become a
qualified sample. Therefore, we can discard the current value and
then choose another value for that dimension by re-sampling. As
far as the proposal distribution is concerned, we construct a random
walk chain by choosing a uniform proposal distribution within the
step length. A detailed description of MH-C algorithm is illustrated
in Algorithm 1 and the related notations are summarized in Table
4.
In Algorithm 1, line 1 initializes the sample set and takes the
RFID raw data. Line 2 loads the n-state detection model of readers
with the objective of computing the likelihood. Line 3 initializes
all the resource descriptors and line 4 randomly chooses a quali-
fied sample as the first state of the Markov Chain. Lines 6 to 17
generate a random sample as the proposal sample dimension by
dimension (object by object). Lines 8 to 13 correspond to the sam-

true distribution, i.e., the smaller value of K-L convergence indi-
cates the higher accuracy of the reconstructed distribution. The
recovered matrices (reconstructed distributions) were inverted by
the matrix inversion module to facilitate the computation of K-L
divergence. Then the K-L divergence module was used to compare
the reconstructed distributions with the true distributions and com-
pute the corresponding K-L divergence values for MCMC and SIS.
On the other hand, the top-k success rate reflected how many cases
can be located precisely at a certain resolution using data cleansing
techniques. The top-k analysis module was responsible for calcu-
lating the top-k success rate.
Definition The top-k success rate is a percentage of the number of
cases whose true locations match the top k predicted locations of
the reconstructed distribution over the total number of cases.
6.3 Visualization of Query Results
To visualize the results of location and remaining capacity queries,
for the simplicity of presentation, we issued queries against the
small-scale warehouse setting. As Table 5 shows, we assume that
there are twenty cases with identical length and five racks with a
length limit to accommodate at most seven cases. True distribu-
tions of the first six cases are shown in Table 6(a) where the rows
represent cases and columns represent racks. To be specific, if a
case is on a rack, the corresponding position is 1 and 0 otherwise.
Therefore, according to Table 6(a), the first case is on the first rack,
the second case is on the fourth rack and so on. On the other hand,
the corresponding noisy RFID data matrix, generated by our sim-
ulator, is shown in Table 6(b) in the same format. By comparing
the two matrices, we can easily see that there is notable difference
(existence of noise and duplicate readings) between these two ma-
trices. Specifically, duplicate readings of the fourth and fifth case
(consecutive 1’s) occur in the noisy raw data. Afterward, we em-
ployed MCMC and SIS to cleanse the noisy distribution matrix to
recover the true distributions. In this experiment, we drew 5000
qualified samples for MCMC and SIS, respectively, and we assume
that the read rate in the major detection region of readers is 95%.
6.3.1 The Location Query
The results of the location queries returned by MCMC and SIS
for the first six cases are demonstrated in Figure 11. For the first
case, the correct location is the first rack. MCMC predicted a prob-
ability of 0.47 on that rack while SIS predicted a probability of only
0.01. Similarly, for the second case, the true location is the fourth

rack. MCMC predicted a probability of 0.70 on that rack while SIS
predicted a probability of 0.98. For the third case, the accurate loca-
tion is the third rack. MCMC predicted a probability of 0.53 on that
rack while SIS predicted a probability of 0.98. For the fourth case,
the exact location is the second rack. MCMC predicted a probabil-
ity of 0.51 on that rack while SIS predicted a probability of 0.32.
For the fifth case, the precise location is the fifth rack. MCMC
predicted a probability of 0.53 on that rack while SIS predicted a
probability of 0.99. At last, for the sixth case, the correct location
is the first rack. MCMC predicted a probability of 0.20 on that
rack while SIS predicted a probability of only 0.05. In summary,
MCMC tends to generate a much smoother probability distribution
than SIS. Consequently, MCMC provides a superior overall pre-
diction of the distribution of all the objects monitored by an RFID
system compared with SIS.
6.3.2 The Remaining Capacity Query
We applied the available length on a rack as the acquirable vol-
ume of that rack to demonstrate the remaining capacity query. The
results of the remaining capacity queries answered by MCMC for
the first five racks are demonstrated in Figure 12. Note that the
remaining capacity on each rack is 3 because each rack exactly ac-
commodates 4 cases according to the true distribution matrix used
for this experiment (the first six rows of the matrix are as shown
in Table 6(a)). As illustrated in Figure 12, the remaining volumes
on racks 1 and 4 were reported correctly. On the contrary, the re-
maining volumes on racks 2 and 3 were underestimated and the
remaining volume on rack 5 was overestimated.
6.4 The Performance Analysis of MH-C
In this section we focus on the performance of MCMC and SIS
with respect to the reconstruction efficiency and accuracy in the
large-scale warehouse setting where there are 5000 cases and 200
racks in total as shown in Table 5. For each result in this section,
we randomly generated the true distribution matrix and the cor-
responding RFID noisy matrix 100 times. We reconstructed case
distributions, recorded the average sampling time, and computed
the average K-L divergence, the top-1 success rate and the top-2
success rate of all the involved 5000 cases.
6.4.1 The Reconstruction Efficiency
Here we investigated the performance of MCMC and SIS in
terms of the average sampling time. Compared to SIS, the aver-
age sampling time of MCMC is remarkably reduced over different
number of qualified samples as illustrated in Figure 13. For exam-
ple, with 5000 qualified samples the sampling time of MCMC is
11.58 seconds while the sampling time of SIS is 230.78 seconds.
This is because MCMC takes advantage of the current qualified
sample to generate the next qualified sample (i.e., keeping the rele-
vance of samples). Consequently, MCMC takes less time than SIS
to come up with the same number of qualified samples .

For each experiment, we drew 5000 qualified samples and the num-
ber of racks managed by a reader is 1. Figure 15 illustrates the
results. With the enlargement of data redundancy degree, both the
performances of MCMC and SIS on reconstruction accuracy are
elevated. Specifically, as demonstrated in Figure 15(a), MCMC al-
ways maintained a lower K-L divergence value than SIS, reflecting
a more precise prediction. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 15(b),
the top-1 success rate of MCMC increased from 0.54 to 0.65 with
the increase of the data redundancy degree while the top-1 success
rate of SIS expanded from 0.42 to 0.51. Figure 15(c) demonstrates
how the top-2 success rate increased when we raised the redun-
dancy degree for MCMC and SIS.
The Impact of the Number of Managed Racks per Reader
We evaluated the performance of MCMC and SIS by varying the
number of managed racks per reader. In order to deploy readers
in a warehouse more efficiently, users may want to assign multiple
racks to be managed by a single reader. Taking into account the
fact that the overall detection region of a regular RFID reader has
little chance to be more than 20 feet [17], we changed the number
of racks managed by a reader from 1 to 6. As Figure 16(a) demon-
strates, when each rack had its own reader, the K-L divergence val-
ues of MCMC and SIS were 0.68 and 3.11, respectively. When a
reader monitored more racks, both the K-L divergence values of
MCMC and SIS deteriorated. When a reader was responsible for
detecting cases on six racks, the K-L divergence values raised to
1.66 of MCMC and 4.01 of SIS. Moreover, as demonstrated in Fig-
ure 16(b), with the enlargement of the number of managed racks
per reader the top-1 success rate of MCMC decreased from 0.65 to
0.55. On the other hand, the top-1 success rate of SIS dropped from
0.51 to 0.41. Also, Figure 16(c) depicts how the top-2 success rate
of MCMC and SIS decreased correspondingly.
7. RELATED WORK
Many systems have been developed to manage data with uncer-
tainty. The usual approach to address uncertainty is to augment the
classical relational model with attribute-level or tuple-level prob-
ability values [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]. On the other hand, a more gen-
eral approach based on sampling is proposed for managing incom-
plete and uncertain data [14, 28]. The idea is simple and intuitive:
we construct random samples while observing the prior statistical
knowledge and constraints about the data. Thus, each sample is one
possible realization in the space of uncertainty, and the entire set of
samples reveals the distribution of the uncertain data we want to
model. Queries and inferences are then conducted against this dis-
tribution.
An important application that drives the recent surge of inter-
est in managing incomplete and uncertain data is RFID data man-
agement. Chawathe et al. [5] proposed a system architecture of a
distributed RFID system and discussed related data management
challenges such as inferences and online warehousing. An expres-
sive temporal data model for RFID data is defined by Wang and
Liu [26] to support tracking and monitoring queries. Gonzalez et
al. [12] designed a warehousing model which provides RFID data
compression and path-dependent aggregates. Based on the pro-
posed warehousing framework, they also developed techniques for
summarizing and indexing RFID data and various query methods.
Because RFID raw data usually contains anomalies [10], solutions
have been proposed to clean the input data from readers. Jeffery
et al. [15] presented a framework for building data cleaning infras-
tructure to support pervasive applications. An adaptive smooth-
ing filter (SMURF) for RFID data cleaning was proposed in [17].
SMURF focuses on a sliding-window aggregate that interpolates
for lost readings. Our paper, however, is motivated by how to lever-
age data redundancy to elevate the localization accuracy for all the
tagged objects in a target area.
The works in [18, 19, 28] are the most relevant research to this
paper. For correcting erroneous RFID raw data, Khoussainova et
al. [18, 19] presented a system for correcting input data errors au-
tomatically using application defined global integrity constraints.
The system corrects the input data by inserting missing tuples when
necessary and assigning to each one the probability that it is correct
for groups of conflicting tuples. This maximum entropy based so-
lution is practical. However, it is unable to capture all application
related prior knowledge and dependency compared with sampling-
based approaches. Useful information can be recovered from noisy
RFID data by exploiting constraints and sequential importance sam-
pling methods [28]. Nevertheless, the work in [28] failed to con-
sider the duplicate readings caused by the overlapped detection re-
gions of RFID readers.
8. CONCLUSIONS
The data reported by RFID devices are known to be unreliable.
In this research, we propose a Bayesian inference based approach
for cleansing RFID raw data which can take advantage of duplicate
readings. In order to evaluate the location and aggregate queries,
our approach employs prior knowledge to quantify the degree of
uncertainty on the location of each object and the remaining ca-
pacities in each zone. Furthermore, we propose the n-state model
to capture likelihood and validate that the 3-state model can max-
imize the system performance. Finally, we devise MH-C to effi-
ciently sample from the posterior distribution under environmental
constraints.

報告自己的研究成果外，也盡量多聽各方先進對資料庫研究最新的進展。我最近比較偏重空間
資料庫相關的研究，所以在會議 SESSION 中，選擇比較多這方面論文的，如"Advanced Query 
Processing", Graph Data & Query"，和"Graph Mining"。在聆聽了這些 SIGMOD 論文後，我的想
法是(1)現今因為資料庫越變越大，而且許多的資料來源也越來越不穩定，這使得統計的工具變
得越來越重要。(2)相對於亞洲別的國家(如香港，新加坡，和印度)，台灣在資料庫研究明顯不
足或落後。

ABSTRACT 
Power Saving Class (PSC) is an essential issue on IEEE 802.16-
2009. In previous research, many algorithms had been proposed to 
reduce the consumption of power, but most of them only 
considered multiple connections in a Mobile Subscriber Station 
(MSS); in fact, it does not fit in with the situation of real world. 
On the contrary, others proposed algorithms considering the 
situation of multiple MSSs with multiple connections; 
nevertheless, it is difficult to increase the amount of MSSs. In this 
paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, which refers to both 
categories and avoids state transitions. When packet size is much 
smaller or delay bound is more loosening, the result shows that 
our scheduling algorithm can serve almost double multiple MSSs 
with multiple connections and still maintain high sleep ratio for 
energy efficiency.

1. INTRODUCTION 
IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access 
(WiMAX) is used for the internet of Broadband Wireless Access 
(BWA), and its characteristics of widespread coverage area in 
metropolitan areas and high-speed bandwidth are much better than 
those of personal communication networks we use today. By 
adopting the structure of Point-to-Multipoint (PMP), a Base 
Station (BS) can serve several Mobile Subscriber Stations (MSSs) 
with multiple connections simultaneously, but the scheduling 
algorithm can not violate each Quality of Service (QoS) demand 
of connections.

Because the scheduling algorithm is an open issue on the Media 
Access Control (MAC) layer in the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard 
(including the specification of IEEE 802.16e) [1], an efficient 
scheduling algorithm must increase the capacity of BS in order to 
serve more MSSs in large-scale environments. Besides, the 
algorithm attempts to make MSSs work longer based on the 
battery-powered energy. In the standard, there are four QoS 
mechanisms: Unsolicited Grant Scheme (UGS), real-time Polling 
Service (rtPS), non-real-time Polling Service (nrtPS) and Best 
Effort service (BE) [2]. UGS, like VoIP, requests consistent 
bandwidth for a guaranteed period of time. Unlike UGS, rtPS, like 
streaming audio or video, requests variable bandwidth and strict 
delay bound. nrtPS, like FTP service, provides efficient service of 
non-real-time traffic with minimum reserved rate. Like web 
browsing, BE allocates bandwidth only when the bandwidth is not 
exhausted. In this paper, we focus on UGS applied to multiple 
connections among multiple MSSs 
The standard also establishes three types of Power Saving Class 
(PSC): type I, type II and type III. Even though the process of 
each type is different, the goal is identical to less energy 
consumption for each MSS. In the PSC, there are two states of 
transceiver within the time unit of frame: on-state and off-state. 
The continuous frames with on-state are called listening period, 
and those with off-state are called sleep period. We can find that 
an association between listening period and sleep period is a 
periodical pattern called sleep cycle. When starting the sleep 
period, the transceiver will go into off-state; when ending the 
sleep period, it will revert back to the on-state. In type I, usually 
applied to BE and Non-Real-Time Variable Rate (NRT-VR), 
sleep period will double itself in the next time when listening 
period has no packet to deliver. When applying to UGS and Real-
Time Variable Rate (RT-VR), type II will repeat sleep cycle 
sequentially; i.e. the sleep cycle has a fixed listening period and 
sleep period. When the purpose of multicast or management 
operations is known beforehand, type III only enters the sleep 
period once. Fig. 1 presents a comparison between these types [3]. 
Because we focus on the UGS of QoS type, we adopt the Type II 
of PSC in this paper. 
In the real world, a MSS usually has multiple connections 
simultaneously; furthermore, a BS also serves many MSSs at the 
same time. The problem is that the BS can only deliver packets to 
a MSS in a time slot, the unit of minimal time for scheduling. 
When PSC is adopted, the whole frame, the unit of minimal time 
for PSC, must awake if a slot wants to deliver a packet. In past 
research, many algorithms had been proposed to reduce the 
consumption of power, but most of them only considered multiple 
connections in a MSS, which does not fit in with real world 
the sleep cycles of two connections are multiples or factors of 
each other, the sleep cycles do not have overlap with each other, 
and they can work together in the same MSS. The same property 
can apply to two MSS patterns in the same BS. Therefore, we 
must maintain each MSS pattern to conform to type II in order to 
interleave with other MSSs as shown in Fig. 3(b). 
 
Figure 3.  Example of  ideas 
Because the probability that sleep cycle of connections or MSS 
pattern becomes the multiple or factor of each other will increase, 
the bandwidth utilization rate of BS pattern will increase, when 
the number of connection and MSS increases. On the other hand, 
in some special cases such as shown in Fig. 4(a), MSS pattern is 
not a multiple or factor of each other but can still interleave 
successfully. Nonetheless, in some special cases such as shown in 
Fig. 4(b), MSS patterns will overlap in some frames. This means 
that those MSSs can not work simultaneously in the same BS. In 
order to simplify the situation of Fig. 4(a) and avoid the situation 
of Fig. 4(b), we can use the relation between multiple and factor 
to schedule the BS patterns like in Fig. 3(b). Furthermore, we 
must schedule the connections of each MSS and consider all four 
parameters, especially state transitions, referred in the previous 
paragraph. 
 
Figure 4.  Example of special case 
3. PROPOSED SCHEMES 
We define that Ti is the length of MSS i, Ts is the minimal length 
of MSS pattern in BS pattern, and Tm is the maximal length of 
MSS pattern in BS pattern. Mu, which means how many Ts are in 
Tm, is that Tm divided by Ts. Sx is the remaining resource in the X
th 
CAGE. TFRi is the request resource of MSS i. Ci,j means 
connection j of the MSS i. Di,j is the delay bound of Ci,j. CHECK 
is used to indicate if the first two different MSS patterns are 
successfully scheduled in the BS pattern. In the below, we 
propose an algorithm to check whether Ti can join to the BS 
pattern.

Input: 
Sorting Ti from minimum to maximum; 
Ts = T1; Tm = T2; Mu = Tm / Ts; S1 = (T1*Bf) –TFR1; CHECK=1;

Output:

For i = 2 to a do 
        If CHECK <> 2 and Mu == 1 
                If S1 > TFR2 
                                S1 = S1 –TFRi; Join Ti to the BS pattern; 
                Else 
                                Can’t join Ti to the BS pattern; 
                End If 
        Else If CHECK <> 2 and Mu <> 1 
                If S1 > TFRi 
                                For k=2 to Mu do 
                                        Sk = S1; S1 = S1 –TFRi; Ts = Ti; CHECK = 2;  
                                End For; Join Ti to the BS pattern; 
                Else 
                                Can’t join Ti to the BS pattern; 
                End If 
        Else 
                For r = 1 to Mu do 
                        For z = 1 to (( Ti / Tm ) – 1 ) do  
                                        Sr = Sr+z*Mu; 
                        End For 
                End For 
                Tm=Ti; 
                If any Sx can contain TFRj; 
                                Join Ti to the BS pattern; 
                Else 
                                Can’t join Ti to the BS pattern; 
                End If 
        End If 
End For 
Because we restrict that Ti is an exponent of 2, as shown in Fig. 5, 
we can avoid the problem presented in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b). 
 
Figure 5.  Example of Algorithm 1 
The remaining work is how to schedule each connection to a sleep 
cycle of type II in the same MSS and maintain each pattern of 
MSS with the exponent of 2. Furthermore, we have to consider 
the basic three parameters together with state transitions but not 
violate those rules. We define that PIi,j is the packet inter-arrival 
time of Ci,j. The frame duration F is assumed to be an exponent of 
2ms. Firstly, we sort Ci,j of the same MSS i by delay bound of Ci,j 
like 𝐷𝑖 ,1 ≤ 𝐷𝑖,2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝐷𝑖,𝑎  and then choose the Di,1 and CAGE, 
which is the length of sleep cycle for Ci,1, qualified by (2). 
situations randomly picked the delay bound from an interval. The 
simulation result presents that when the interval is more loosening, 
PSS-CAGE can contain more MSSs as a result of bigger gap 
between the maximum length of MSS pattern and the minimum 
length of MSS pattern. As the same, the results shown in Fig. 8 
can response to the situation of Fig. 2.

Figure 10.  Effects of Bf on the successful scheduling rate 
4.3 Effects of Maximum Bandwidth (Bf) 
We randomly pick the packet size from 40 to 80 bytes per frame 
and gradually increased the Bf from 150 to 2500 bytes per frame. 
Furthermore, we set five MSSs working simultaneously in this 
simulation. Through Fig. 9, we can observe that PS can not 
activate the sleep mode when Bf is lower than 500 bytes per frame 
because the total requested bandwidth of all MSSs exceeds Bf; 
nevertheless, PSS-CAGE can activate even though the Bf is very 
small. This phenomenon happens because PSS-CAGE can 
abandon some MSSs in order to successfully schedule others 
when Bf is very small; however, PS can only either successfully 
schedule all MSSs with all connections or schedule none of them. 
In other words, PSS-CAGE gets better performance than PS when 
the BS lay in high loading. We can also observe that when Bf is 
lower than or equal to 500 bytes per frame, PSS-CAGE can 
successfully and completely schedule as many MSSs into BS as 
PS after Bf is greater than or equal to 750 bytes in Fig. 10. 
Although PS still obtains higher sleep ratio when Bf exceeds 500 
bytes per frame, PSS-CAGE is very close to PS as shown in Fig. 9. 
The gap between PS and PSS-CAGE is only 3% and lower than 
1% when Bf is greater than or equal to 500 bytes per frame. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we propose a new power saving algorithm called 
PSS-CAGE that can let more MSSs work simultaneously than 
previous work and still maintain high sleep ratio. Besides, PSS-
CAGE also avoids state transitions issue by adopting type II of 
PSC. Thus, each connection and MSS can maintain a regular 
pattern and does not violate its delay bound. In other words, PSS-
CAGE can decrease additional listening period and try its best to 
approach the delay bound. According to Fig.7, the result indicates 
that PSS-CAGE can schedule more MSSs simultaneously than PS, 
and PSS-CAGE still maintains high sleep ratio as shown in Fig. 9.
