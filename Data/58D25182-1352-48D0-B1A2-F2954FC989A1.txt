摘 要 
關鍵詞：取樣數據控制、離散非週期時變系統、極限系統、可偵測性、全
域穏定性、自走車。 
在目前的文獻中，大部份的控制器設計仍以連續時間模型為主，再應
用電腦或微處理器實現之。這樣的做法很直接，但在理論上很難保證原設
計的控制器，在數位化之後仍具有同樣的控制效果。更恰當的做法為直接
考慮數位控制器，並推導整個閉迴路數位化系統，再加以設計之， 以逹到
所要求的控制目標。 
    基於上述的考量，本計晝研究取樣控制系統之準確(非近似)離散模型
的穏定性分析與控制。在非線性離散時間系統的穏定性分析中，最常用的
一個定理為LaSalle不變法則，然而該法則只適用於週期系統，對一般的時
變系統是不成立的。有兩個理由迫使我們必須考慮非週期系統，第一個是
許多受控系統是時變非週期的如追踨控制系統，更甚的是即使受控系統是
週期系統，取樣後常會轉變成非週期系統。 
    在上述背景下，本計晝首先推廣了LaSalle不變法則到非週期時變系統
以擴大理論的應用範圍，其中極限系統及可偵測性的觀念扮演了關鍵性的
角色，而後再以所推得的廣義LaSalle不變法則來研究取樣數據控制，特別
地本計畫提出了一個新的自走車取樣數據控制器之設計，其中廣義的
LaSalle不變法則提供了很深入的穩定性分析。相關的研究已以全文(Full 
Paper)型式刊登在控制界深具權威之IEEE Transaction on Automatic 
Control期刊上，足見本計晝的執行已強化我國在學術上的國際競爭力。

漸進穩定的。在實際的應用上，往往找到的能量函數其差分只為半負定 (negative 
semidefinite)，故無法應用李阿普諾的穩定性定理，此時 LaSalle 不變法則即可派上用場。
從理論的角度來看 LaSalle 不變法則，其減弱能量函數的條件可有效增加能量函數的選擇
性(即增加 Lyapunov functions candidates)，使控制器設計更有彈性。這個特性也使得 LaSalle
不變法則成為非線性離散時間系統穏定性分析中一個非常重要與不可或缺的工具。 
然而眾所皆知的、LaSalle 不變法則只適用於週期時變系統[14]，對一般的非週期時
變系統是不成立的。至少有兩個理由迫使我們必須考慮非週期系統，第一個是許多受控系
統本身的特性就是時變非週期的，如機械與電子電路系統的追踨控制[9,23,35,37]，第二
個理由是即使受控系統是週期系統，取樣後常會轉變成非週期系統。 
基於這兩個重要的原因，本計晝第一個目的為推廣 LaSalle 不變法則到非週期的時變
系統，以解決上述的困境，並加強 LaSalle 不變法則的適用範圍，使之更符合實際的需求。
特別的我們將以極限系統及可偵測性的觀念來研究 LaSalle 不變法則的推廣。本計晝的另
一個目的為應用推得的廣義 LaSalle 不變法則來研究取樣數據控制(sampled-data 
control)，以穩定原連續時間系統，我們將以移動式機器人的取樣數據控制設計為例來說
明相關推廣的重要性。所獲得的成果將提供數位化控制器設計的堅實基礎並可大大的提升
國家的數位化科技與國際競爭力。 
 
 
三、文獻探討 
誠如前述，本計畫的理論部份是研究非線性時變、離散時間系統(nonlinear 
time-varying discrete-time systems)的穏定性，主要的目標為為推廣 LaSalle 不變法則
到非週期的時變系統，而應用部份則為取樣數據控制，以下分成兩段詳細討論之。 
1. 非線性時變、離散時間系統穩定性相關研究 
在非線性時變、離散時間系統中最常用的定理為李阿普諾(Lyapunov)穩定性定理
([25,14,36])。其敘述簡單也廣為使用，但在實際應用上並不總是容易找到一個合適相關
限制條件的李阿普諾函數，例如移動式機器人的數位控制系統，即不易找到這樣的函數
[14]，故有推廣的必要。目前大部份的文獻最常用的替代定理，為基於 LaSalle 不變法則
的結果[19]，即著名的 Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理之離散時間版本[36]。然而誠如研究目的
中所述，基於 LaSalle 不變法則的定理只適用於週期時變系統，並不適用於一般的追踨控
制系統，又如移動式機器人的討論中所示，對取樣控制而言，這些結果仍然是不足夠的，
這顯示出 LaSalle 不變法則及其相關推論皆有推廣的必要性。 
相較於連續時間系統，這方面的推廣與結果並不多見，大多針對某些特殊結構之系統
而探討之。其中文獻[12]討論非時變離散時間系統的可偵測性問題，[10]探討具干擾之系
統的輸入輸出穩定性，[11]研究具干擾之系統的逆李阿普諾定理，[32]則考慮感應馬逹的
數位化模型，並提出一個穏定化的數位控制器，[24]與[27]則研究串聯(cascaded)系統的
穏定性，藉著假設無輸入之個別子系統的穏定性來保證整個串聯系統的穏定性。值得一提
的是 Teel 及其合作者提出許多有意思的相關推廣，其中[13]考慮差分包含(difference 
inclusions)系統，研究其靭性(robust)控制與平滑(smooth)李阿普諾函數之間等價性與關
係，[28]則考慮 Matrosov 定理的推廣至非線性時變離散時間系統，基本上他們考慮一組(而

四、研究方法 
本計劃係針對非線性時變、離散時間系統的穏定性分析作深入的探討，並研究在取樣
數據控制(sampled-data control)方面的應用。主要的目標為推廣離散系統的李阿普諾定
理及離散時間的 Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理，在精神上將是 LaSalle 不變法則的延伸與推廣，
另一方面我們亦研究這些結果在移動式機器人之取樣數據控制的應用。更詳細的說，我們
先研究適合於離散系統穏定性分析的可偵測性定義，然後探討李阿普諾定理的推廣，而後
研究簡化可偵測性定義的可行性來推廣離散時間的 Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理，並應用這些結
果到串聯系統上，以檢驗所推得理論的價值。此外，我們亦簡潔的研究取樣數據控制與離
散系統之關係，再將所推得的離散時間系統相關定理應用在移動式機器人的取樣數據控制
上，詳細的成果與說明請參考下一節。 
 
五、結果與討論 
本計劃所獲致的成果相當豐碩，詳見附錄的英文全文，以下僅分段列出主要的結果
並 簡 要 的 說 明 之 。 本 計 畫 將 使 用 下 列 的 符 號 及 定 義 :

1. 一致全域漸近穩定性(UGAS)的第一個刻劃 
首 先 ， 介 紹 極 限 解 (limiting solution) 及弱可偵測性 (weakly zero-state 
detectable ;WZSD)的定義如下:  
Definition 1. A function XZx →+:  is called a limiting solution of (1) with respect to an 
unbounded sequence { kt } in +Z , if there exist a 0>r and a sequence { }rtk BZx k →+:  of 
solutions of (1) such that for each +∈ Zn , the associated sequence { })( kk tnx +  converges 
to )(nx .      
Definition 2. System (1)-(2) is weakly zero-state detectable (WZSD) if, for any limiting 
solution x of (1) with respect to an unbounded sequence { kt } in +Z  that satisfies the 
following equation 
,,0))(,(lim +∞→ ∈∀=+ Znnxtnh kk                   (3) 
we have  
.0)(inf =+∈ nxZn                             (4) 
    考慮下列的假設: 
(C1) 0)(lim =∞→ nxn  for any limiting solution x  of (1). 
(H1) There exists a continuous function ),0[: ∞→ℜqµ , with 0)0( =µ  and 0)( >vµ  for 
all 0≠v  such that, for each 0>σ and each 0>r  there exists a constant 
 6
,0))(,( =nxnhγ +∈∀ Zn , it holds that .0)(inf =+∈ nxZn  
    則可推得下列一致全域漸近穩定性的第二個刻劃: 
Theorem 2. Consider a system of the form (1)-(2) where f  and h  are both continuous in 
argument x, uniformly in n. Suppose that the origin is uniformly globally stable. Then, the 
origin is UGAS if and only if (H1) and (H2) hold.                                 ■ 
定理二(Theorem 2)可視為離散時間的 Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理之推廣，因為令
⋅=µ 且輸出為 ),()),(,1( xnVxnfnVy −+= ，其中 V為李阿普諾函數，則 (H1) 可由 V
之遞減特性推得，(H2)則來自不變性條件，故可由定理二推出下列的離散時間之
Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理。  
Corollary 2.  Consider a system of the form (1) where f  is a continuous periodic function. 
Let ),0[: ∞→ℜ×+ pZV be a continuous function with the same period as f such that  
)(),()( 21 xWxnVxW ≤≤ ,                      (10) 
( 1, ( , )) ( , ) 0,V n f n x V n x+ − ≤                     (11) 
for all +∈ Zn , all px ℜ∈  where ),0[:1 ∞→ℜ pW  and ),0[:2 ∞→ℜ pW  are continuous 
positive definite functions with ∞=∞→ )(lim 1 xWx . Suppose that for any m in +Z , the zero 
solution is the unique solution : m px Z+ →ℜ  satisfying ( , ( )) ( , ( ))V n x n V m x m= , mn Z+∀ ∈ . 
Then, the origin is UGAS.                                                   ■      
3.應用至串聯系統 
    定理 1-2 可用以建立時變串聯系統的穩定性如下: 
Theorem 3. Consider a system in the following hierarchical form: 
,,,2,1)),(),(,),(,()1( 11 Ninxnxnxnfnx iiii LL ==+ −             (12) 
where ,,,2,1, Nix ini L=ℜ∈  are state variables and Nifi ,,2,1, L= , is continuous in

Suppose the solutions of the system are globally uniformly bounded and the origin is UGAS 
for all reduced subsystems .,2,1),,(ˆ)1(ˆ Nixnfnx iii L==+  Then, UGAS also holds for the 
whole system.                                                              ■

LEE AND JIANG: ON UNIFORM GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY 1645
see, for instance, Section IV. These observations motivate our
study for the UGAS property of discrete-time time-varying sys-
tems. As an illustration of our stability results on discrete-time
time-varying systems, we will study in details the design of
a sampled-data nonlinear controller on the basis of the exact
models of a continuous-time system.
In the study of stability for nonlinear discrete-time systems,
a powerful tool is the well-known LaSalle invariance principle
[19]. A central limitation of this result is that it is not applicable
to general non-periodic non-autonomous systems [14]. How-
ever, many engineering applications involve feedback systems
that are usually nonperiodic, for instance, the tracking control
problem for mechanical systems [27]. As another interesting
example, sampled-data control systems may become non-peri-
odic even though the original continuous-time systems are pe-
riodic; as shown in Section IV. Thus, it is desirable to have ef-
fective tools for studying nonperiodic time-varying systems. In
[28], a novel nested Matrosov theorem was proposed to pro-
vide such criterion. After our paper was submitted, we became
aware of the independent work [38] where summation-type con-
ditions were proposed for uniform asymptotic convergence in
discrete-time systems.
The main purpose of our paper is to contribute a different
method towards stability analysis of time-varying, not nec-
essarily periodic, discrete-time systems. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we develop two new characterizations
of UGAS. While the proposed results are the counterpart
recently developed for continuous-time systems [22], some
involved definitions appeared in continuous-time systems such
as asymptotically almost periodic (AAP) functions [34] and
uniform convergence are further simplified due to the simpler
(discrete) topology in Z than in . Moreover, it is shown that
the proposed stability criteria for time-varying discrete-time
systems suit well for the stabilization problem of sampled-data
nonlinear control systems, based on the exact discrete-time
models. Secondly, we apply the obtained stability results to
analyze uniform asymptotic stability of cascaded time-varying
systems. As we will see in Subsection III-C, some technical
assumptions in recent papers, e.g., [27], can be relaxed.
The first characterization of UGAS is based on the finding
that, under some mild assumptions, weak-zero state de-
tectability is equivalent to UGAS for globally uniformly stable
discrete-time systems. The second characterization of UGAS
says that to test UGAS for a time-varying discrete-time system
it is sufficient to verify a detectability condition for its reduced
limiting systems. It is shown how the first characterization of
UGAS can serve as a fundamental tool to extend the classical
Lyapunov direct method for stability analysis of discrete-time
systems. More interestingly, the second characterization of
UGAS is a valuable tool for practical applications. Through the
use of limiting systems, the verification of the UGAS property
of the original system is reduced down to the test of some
detectability properties for its reduced limiting systems, which
are often reminiscent of “zero-dynamics” of the original system
[5], [20], [22]. An interesting example from the sampled-data
control of mobile robots will be supplied to demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed results in practical applications.
Particularly, we show by this example that in general, the sam-
pled-data systems may become non-periodic even though their
original continuous-time systems are periodic. In this case,
our results can replace the classic LaSalle invariance principle
to guarantee attractivity in the same spirit but using reduced
limiting systems rather than the original systems. Moreover, the
proposed criteria are applicable to studying uniform asymptotic
stability of a class of cascaded time-varying, discrete-time
systems. It is shown how the proper application of our first
characterization of UGAS leads to the (slight) relaxation of
some technical assumptions needed for stability results in [24],
[27].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we introduce some necessary mathematical preliminaries and
recall the key notions of detectability, limiting solutions, and
limiting functions. In Section III, we state the main results of
the paper that include among other results the two characteriza-
tions of UGAS. Then, they are applied to studying the UGAS
property of a class of cascaded systems. Section IV presents an
illustrative example related to the sampled-data control of mo-
bile robots. Some concluding remarks are offered in Section V.
II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we give several basic notions and re-
sults that are instrumental for the development of our
main results in the rest of this paper. These notions in-
clude limiting solutions, limiting functions and weak
zero-state detectability. Throughout this paper, we denote
and
for any . Whenever there is no
confusion, we simply denote .
A. Limiting Solutions and Detectability
We study a nonlinear, time-varying, discrete-time, system de-
scribed by
(1)
(2)
where is the state, is the output and
and are all functions defined on with
. System
(1)–(2) is assumed in the output-injection form in the sense that
, for any and
some continuous function with .
This technical assumption is to relax the regularity requirements
(e.g., without assuming to be a continuous function) and
simplify the form of reduced systems, see Subsections III-C
and Section IV for such examples. A function
for some is said to be a solution of (1) starting from
if .
To simplify the whole discussions, we also assume that is
continuous with respect to , uniformly in , i.e., for each
and each , there exists a so that
.
To make our work self-contained, let us first recall some def-
initions of stability from the past literature; see, for instance,
[1], [7]. Consider system (1). The origin is said to be uniformly
LEE AND JIANG: ON UNIFORM GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY 1647
any there exists a so that for
all and all in . In the sequel, we first give two in-
teresting technical results on uniform boundedness and uniform
continuity for discrete-time functions continuous at any , uni-
formly in , where the proof of the uniform boundedness can
be found in Appendix A.
Lemma 3: Suppose is a function con-
tinuous at any , uniformly in with being bounded.
Then, is uniformly bounded.
In the theory of real analysis, it is well-known that every con-
tinuous function on is also uniformly continuous on every
compact subset of [18]. In the following, we state a similar
result where it is said that a function is uni-
formly continuous on a compact set , uniformly in , if
for any , there exists a such that for all
with , we have .
Its proof is omitted for want of space.
Lemma 4: Suppose is a function con-
tinuous at any , uniformly in . Then, for any compact set
, it is uniformly continuous on , uniformly in .
Now, we show that, under the assumption of Lemma 3, the
function can serve as a discrete-time version of asymptot-
ically almost periodic (AAP) functions [22]. More explicitly,
the following result can be derived from Arzela–Ascoli lemma
where it is said that a sequence of functions
is equicontinuous on a set if, for any there exists a
only depending on and such that
with [18].
Proposition 1: Suppose is a function
continuous at any , uniformly in and is bounded.
Then, for any unbounded sequence in there exist a
subsequence of and a function
such that is a limiting function of associated with .
Moreover, is also continuous at any , uniformly in .
Proof: According to Lemma 3, is uniformly
bounded. Thus, for each in , the associated sequence
is totally bounded on every compact
subset of . In view of Lemma 4, it can also be seen that
is equicontinuous on every compact subset of . By
employing the Arzela–Ascoli Lemma [18], for each in ,
there exists a subsequence of so that
converges to a continuous function on every compact subset
of where denotes the sequence . According to
the diagonal process, we choose a sequence
such that it is a common subsequence of for all .
Let and . Then, it
can be concluded that for each in and each in ,
the sequence converges to
by the choices of and . This particularly shows
that the associated sequence
converges pointwise to on . Thus, is a limiting
function of associated with . It remains to show that
is continuous at any , uniformly in . Notice that, for each
and each , there exists a so that
, by the
continuity of . Taking the limit, we have
. This shows that is continuous at ,
uniformly in . It completes the proof of the proposition.
The following result is a direct consequence of Proposition 1.
Corollary 1: Suppose is a bounded function.
Then, for any unbounded sequence in there exists a
subsequence of with .
Before closing this section, let us propose a simple result re-
lated to the limiting functions of a composite function. The proof
follows readily from the continuity property and thus is omitted.

III. MAIN RESULTS
In this section, we propose two new characterizations of
UGAS for nonlinear time-varying discrete-time systems. One
characterization is based upon WZSD and an almost bounded
output energy condition-(H1) while the other one invokes
(H1) and a detectability condition associated with reduced
limiting systems to simplify the WZSD condition. The notion
of reduced limiting systems will be defined later, in terms of
limiting functions. Furthermore, we also show that the proposed
results generalize both the classical Lyapunov theorem and the
Krasovskii–LaSalle theorem in the context of discrete-time
time-varying systems. More interestingly, we derive conditions
under which the UGAS property of a class of time-varying
and discrete-time cascaded systems is guaranteed. Particularly,
it is shown that the local Lipschitz assumption (on Lyapunov
functions) introduced in the recent work [24], [27] can be
relaxed by merely requiring the continuity.
A. First Characterization of UGAS
In this subsection, we propose a new criterion for UGAS of
time-varying discrete-time systems. It is a generalization of the
well-known Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, certain converse re-
sults will also be given. This way, a new characterization for
UGAS can be obtained based on our approaches.
First, let us consider the following condition which, roughly
speaking, states that the output energy eventually approaches to
zero as time goes to infinity.
(C2) For each and each , there exists a
such that, for any and any solution
of (1)
(5)
Then, by detectability and the convergence of output energy,
it can be expected that the origin is attractive. More explicitly,
the following result can be obtained based on (C2) and WZSD.
Proposition 2: Consider a system of the form (1)–(2) where
is continuous at any , uniformly in . Suppose the origin is
uniformly globally stable. Assume further that (C2) holds and
the system is WZSD. Then, the origin is UGAS.
The proof of Proposition 2 is postponed to Appendix B.
Now, we show that Proposition 2 can be further improved by
LEE AND JIANG: ON UNIFORM GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY 1649
the two sides of (8) and using the second inequality of (7), the
following inequalities can be derived:
(9)
for all , all , all and all solutions
of (1). Then, (H1) holds. Therefore, the proof of
the proposition is completed in view of Theorem 1.
Consider a special case where . In this case, the system
clearly is WZSD. So, the following classical Lyapunov theorem
can be deduced from Proposition 4.
Corollary 2: Consider a system of the form (1). Let
be a positive–definite continuous function and
be a function such that
(10)
(11)
for all , all where and
are continuous positive–definite functions
with . Then, the origin is UGAS.
B. Second Characterization of UGAS in Terms of Reduced
Limiting Systems
In this subsection, we propose the second characterization
of UGAS in terms of reduced limiting systems, instead of the
original system. We use it to obtain a generalization of a dis-
crete-time version of the well-known Krasovskii–LaSalle the-
orem.
First, we define what is a reduced limiting system. Consider
a system of the form (1)–(2) given in Section II. Throughout
this subsection, we assume that and are both continuous in
argument , uniformly in . Consider the extended function
. Then, is also continuous in argument , uniformly
in . Moreover,
. Thus, for any unbounded sequence in there exists
a subsequence of in view of Proposition 1.
Particularly, the set is not empty. Thus,
the following definition makes sense.
Definition 4: A reduced limiting system of system (1)–(2) as-
sociated with is defined as
(12)
(13)
We impose the following simplified detectability hypoth-
esis that, roughly speaking, describes a “weak zero-state
detectability” on reduced limiting system (12)–(13) (see [22]
for a similar definition in the context of continuous-time nonau-
tonomous systems).
(H2) For any admissible sequence and any
bounded solution of reduced limiting system
(12)–(13) satisfying the equation , it
holds that .
Now, we are in a position to state the main result of this sub-
section. To avoid the interruption of the whole discussions, its
proof is postponed to Appendix C.
Theorem 2: Consider a system of the form (1)–(2) where
and are both continuous in argument , uniformly in . Sup-
pose that the origin is uniformly globally stable. Then, the origin
is UGAS if and only if (H1)–(H2) holds.
As a special case, consider a system consisting of continuous
periodic functions with the same period. In this case, it is not
difficult to see that and are both continuous in argument
, uniformly in . Moreover, every limiting function is just a
time-shifting of the original function. Then, (H2) is equivalent
to the following condition.
(C3) For any and any bounded solution
of that satisfies the equation
, it holds that .
Now, the following result is a simple consequence of The-
orem 2. It can be viewed as a generalized Krasovskii–LaSalle
theorem in discrete-time systems [36].
Corollary 3: Consider a system of the form (1)–(2) where
and are continuous periodic functions with the same period.
Suppose that the origin is uniformly globally stable. Then, the
origin is UGAS if and only if (H1) and (C3) hold.
Based on Corollary 3, the following result that is a discrete-
time version of the well-known Krasovskii–LaSalle theorem
[36] can be proposed. In fact, by taking and the output
as , (H1) can be derived from
the non-increasing property of Lyapunov function . More-
over, (C3) follows from the condition that the zero solution is
the unique solution satisfying
.
Corollary 4: Consider a system of the form (1) where is a
continuous periodic function. Let be a
continuous function with the same period as such that
(14)
(15)
for all , all where and
are continuous positive definite functions
with . Suppose that for any in ,
the zero solution is the unique solution satis-
fying . Then, the origin
is UGAS.
C. Specifications to Time-Varying Discrete-Time Cascades
In this subsection, we consider an interesting application to il-
lustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new discrete-time sta-
bility criteria. More precisely, we will derive conditions under
which the UGAS property of a class of time-varying and dis-
crete-time cascaded systems is guaranteed. Particularly, it is
shown that the local Lipschitz assumption (on Lyapunov func-
tions) introduced in [24] and [27] can be relaxed by merely re-
quiring continuity. Furthermore, with the help of a novel con-
verse Lyapunov theorem, the UGAS property can also be guar-
anteed for the overall cascaded system provided that the solu-
tions are globally uniformly bounded, and all reduced subsys-
tems are continuous and satisfy the UGAS property. It should
LEE AND JIANG: ON UNIFORM GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY 1651
where the last equality follows from the facts
and that is continuous at the origin with
. This results in
for all where the continuity of and was used
throughout. Thus, the claim is true. Taking the sum on the two-
sides of (21), it holds that
This implies that . Since is a con-
tinuous positive–definite function and every limiting solution is
bounded, it can be deduced that . This to-
gether with , shows that the system is
WZSD. The proof of the theorem follows readily from Theorem
1.
Remark 5: Notice that, the technical assumption that the
solutions are globally uniformly bounded is crucial. In fact,
the whole system may not be UGAS in the absence of this
assumption. Additional conditions, imposed on the cross term
, are necessary to guarantee the
uniform boundedness of all solutions. For such results, we refer
the interested reader to [24], [27] for the discrete-time case and
[33] for the continuous-time case.
Remark 6: In [27, Cor. 2], a similar result was proposed under
a stronger Lipschitz continuous condition. Loosely speaking,
this condition was proposed to yield an inequality similar to
Bellman–Gronwall inequality in differential equations and to
control the bound of solutions. Thus, it is not clear how to use
merely the continuity of the Lyapunov function to draw the same
conclusion along the lines given in that paper.
While the Lyapunov function-based condition (C5) is enough
for many practical applications, it is still interesting and natural
to use (C4) to guarantee UGAS of cascaded system (16)–(17).
In the following, we would like to propose such a result by using
Theorem 3 and the continuity of . To this end, we need a con-
verse Lyapunov theorem as follows. Its proof is postponed to
Appendix E.
Proposition 5: Consider a system of the form (18) and define
a function as follows:
(22)
Suppose the origin of (18) is UGAS and is continuous with
respect to , uniformly in . Then, there exists a function
continuous in argument , uni-
formly in , such that (19)–(20) holds.
Notice that Proposition 5 shows that (C4) implies (C5) under
the continuity assumption of systems. Moreover, (C4) as well
as the assumption that the solutions are globally uniformly
bounded are necessary conditions of the UGAS property with
respect to (16)–(17). Thus, the following result is readable from
Theorem 3 and Proposition 5.
Proposition 6: Consider a system of the form (16)–(17) and
the function defined in (22). Suppose is continuous with
respect to , uniformly in . Then, the origin is UGAS if and
only if (C4) holds and the solutions are globally uniformly
bounded.
Remark 7: In [27, Cor. 1], a related result was proposed by
using a trajectory-based condition, called as the UGC condition.
In general, the UGC condition is hard to check since it involves
the estimation of solutions. To overcome such difficulty, a Lip-
schitz condition was made on the right-hand side of the differ-
ence equation to check the UGC condition, see [27, Prop. 2]. In
contrast to this, Proposition 6 only needs the continuity assump-
tion.
Recursively using Proposition 6 and in view of Remark 3,
the following corollary can be proposed for systems in a hierar-
chical form. It is a discrete-version of [36, Th. 86, p. 259].
Corollary 5: Consider a system in the following hierarchical
form:
(23)
where , are state variables and
, is continuous in argument ,
uniformly in , with . For each , define
a reduced function as
(24)
Suppose the solutions of the system are globally uniformly
bounded and the origin is UGAS for all reduced subsystems
. Then, UGAS also holds
for the whole system.
IV. APPLICATION TO SAMPLED-DATA STABILIZATION OF
MOBILE ROBOTS
Over the last few years, the stabilization problem of a non-
holonomic mobile robot has been extensively studied by many
researchers. See, for example, [16] and [37] for a tutorial. In this
section, we address the sampled-data stabilization of the same
benchmark example of mobile robots. An interesting stabilizer
will be presented using the exact discrete-time model as opposed
to an approximate discrete-time model that was considered in
[17] and [27].
A. An Exact Discrete-Time Model for Mobile Robots
In this section, our aim is to design a sampled-data stabilizing
controller for mobile robots by means of the stability criteria
LEE AND JIANG: ON UNIFORM GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY 1653
system is uniformly stable by the global stability of the sub-
system consisting of first and second equations. Therefore it can
be concluded that the origin of the whole closed-loop system is
also uniformly globally stable. In the remainder, let us use The-
orem 2 to check attractivity.
Define a virtual output
(34)
In view of (30)–(31), it can be checked that
and, hence
(35)
Taking sum on the two sides of [35], (H1) holds with
. Notice that the closed-loop system can be written
into the form of (1) where
(36)
and . Due to
and the closed-loop system is in the output injection form.
Since is a function continuous in argument , uniformly
in , it can be seen that and are both continuous in argument
, uniformly in , in view of (34) and (36). Moreover,
and . By Theorem
2, it remains to check (H2).
Let be any admissible sequence. By virtue of
Proposition 1, there exists a limiting function of associated
with a subsequence of . By the uniqueness of limit,
every subsequence of admissible sequence yields the same lim-
iting function. Particularly, and . According
to Lemma 5, the reduced limiting systems can be described as
follows:
(37)
(38)
To verify (H2), we can assume that . In view of (37),
and are both constant functions. If , it can be
seen that .
Thus, and, hence, .
Therefore, (H2) holds in this case. If , we would
like to choose a suitable function such that this case cannot
occur. Define . Then, there exists a such
that and . Let
. By (38) and , it can be derived that
Since
, it can be concluded that
, by the definition of in (27). We claim that
. First, notice
that by (37), . If , we
have and hence the claim holds. If ,
with (28), we have
In this case, the claim also holds. That is to say that
is a constant function. Since takes the same value
only finite times on a compact interval and is a bounded func-
tion, is a finite set. Notice that
. This implies that
is also a finite set. Due to this fact, if we
can find a function so that is an infi-
nite set whenever , we will reach a contradiction
and it can be concluded that (H2) holds. To meet such condi-
tion, a simple choice is
where is a positive definite con-
tinuous function and with the set defined as
is a rational number (39)
Thus, is continuous at , uniformly in , with
. Moreover, every limiting func-
tion of takes the form
, and some .
In the following, let us show that the sampled function
takes infinite values and is not periodic.
Lemma 8: Consider the function with
and . Then, it takes the same value at most at
two time instants. Particularly, it is not a periodic function.
Proof: Notice that
implies that there exists a such that or
. If and ,
we have that , a contradiction. Thus,
for different and implies that
there exists a such that .
If there exists three different , such that
, it holds that
for some . This again implies
and we reach another contradiction.
Thus, the claim is true, i.e., takes the same value
at most at two time instants. Particularly, it is not a periodic
function. This completes the proof of the lemma.
From Lemma 8, it is easy to see that
is an infinite set whenever . Particularly, it can

let us show that is also a closed set. Let be any limit
point of . Then, there exists a sequence contained in
such that . Again by the continuity of ,
there exists a so that
. Thus, there exists a large enough
such that . This implies
that
and . So, is closed. Since is connected, we have
[18]. As a result, the claim is true.
In the following, we prove the lemma by contradiction. Sup-
pose is not uniformly bounded. Then, there exists a
such that for each , there exist a in and a in
satisfying . Since is compact, there
exists a subsequence of such that converges
to a point in . Since is continuous at any , uniformly
in , we have
We reach a contradiction by the claim. Thus, is uniformly
bounded. It completes the proof of the lemma.
APPENDIX B
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2
The theorem will be proven by contradiction. Suppose the
origin is not UGAS. Then, there exist a and a
such that for each , there exist some
(thus, ) and a solution of (1) satisfying
and . Since the solutions
are globally uniformly bounded, there is also a so that
lies within the compact set . Notice that, due to the fact
, uniform stability implies that there exists
a such that for all
and all . For each , let be
the positive integer given in (C2). Now, choose a subsequence
of satisfying . In the following,
let be any positive integer. By (C2), there exists a ,
with so that
(A1)
LEE AND JIANG: ON UNIFORM GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY 1657
Thus, the following equation can be derived:
Thus, the claim is true by the inductive principle. Particularly,
every solution of reduced limiting system
(12)–(13) satisfying the equation ,
is a limiting solution of (1). By Lemma 2, we have
and, hence, (H2) holds. This completes the
proof of the theorem.
APPENDIX D
PROOF OF LEMMA 7
Let be any constant. Our target is to find a posi-
tive constant so that for each and each solution
of (16)–(17) with and
, we have and .
By (C5) and Corollary 2 (Lyapunov theorem), the solutions of
(18) are globally uniformly bounded. Thus, there exists a con-
stant so that for each and each solution
of (16)–(17) with and
, the following inequalities hold:
(A8)
(A9)
Let us define and choose some constants as follows. Since
, is a continuous positive definite function and
, we can find three positive constants
, satisfying
and
(A10)
Since is continuous with respect to , uniformly in , it is
also uniformly continuous on , uniformly in by Lemma 4.
Thus, there exists a such that with ,
(A11)
By assumption, is continuous at the origin and hence, there
exists a such that . By the
UGAS property of (17), there is also a such that for
each and each solution of (17) with
, we have
(A12)
Let . We claim that for each
and each solution of (16)–(17) with
and , we have and
. The uniform stability of the origin
follows from the claim.
The claim will be proven by induction. First, the claim
holds for by noticing that . Now, let
be any integer. By the inductive hypothesis, we can assume
that and . Since
and by (A12), we have
. To finish the proof of the claim, it remains to
show that . In view of , the
following definition makes sense:
(A13)
By the definition of , it can be seen that and
. According to (20), the fol-
lowing inequality holds:
(A14)
for all . Since , it holds that
. This results in
(A15)
by the choice of . Notice that the inequalities
and also hold in view of (A8)–(A9),
. Thus, the following inequality can be derived:
by employing (A14), (A11), and (A15). In view of the choice of
and using the fact , we have
. From this fact and using the inequality
for the case , we can conclude that
if
if (A16)

. Thus, is positive definite. It remains to show
that is continuous. Since and are both continuous in
argument , uniformly in , we have that for any and
any , there exists a such that
and
for any and any with . This
results in
The continuity of follows from the previous inequality. This
completes the proof of the proposition.

一、參加會議經過：
IEEE 2007 年機器人與自動化國際會議(2007 IEEE International Conferenceon Robotics
and Automation)於 2007 年 4月 10 日至 4月 14 日在義大利著名的觀光與歷史重地-羅馬盛大
地舉開。本次會議的主要內容為探討『普遍存在的機器人 (UBIQUITOUS ROBOTICS) 。』並藉
此匯集來自全世界各地的學者專家共同探討機器人與自動化未來的發展趨勢。依據大會的報
告約有一千八百多篇文章投稿而僅有八百篇左右文章被接受為會議發表論文，通過率僅為四
成多，報告人能參加此次會議與有榮幸。
本次會議繼承以往傳統分為邀請演講、一般報告的分組討論與影片的分組討論等，內容
相當精采。其中如娛樂性機器人、生物機器人、具有感情的機器人及微機電等皆令人印象深
刻，相信以前在科幻電影所看到的內容不久的將來將出現在我們的日常生活當中。另外，會
場亦有許多廠商展覽其自動化與機器人相關產品，可作為日後研究的參考。
二、與會心得：
此次會議中看到許多相當先進的研究成果，可作為日後研究方向的參考。然而卻也發現
這些成果大多為美日等國的實驗室所研發，顯示我國的機器人與自動化相關科技仍有相當成
長空間，若能投入更多人力與經費，發展將不可限量。
三、建議：
台灣半導體與 PC 相關產業的發展已在世界上扮演一重要角色，其中的自動化設備卻大多
從國外引進，若我國可自行研發相關產品，一方面可擴大內需，另一方面也可提高我們的技
術水準並創造另一個高科技產業，何樂而不為?

where 5321 ),,,,( ℜ∈Tzzzyx  is a state vector and 
2),( ℜ∈Tvu  is a control vector.  
Remark 1. Based on the condition proposed in [15], it can be 
seen that (1) cannot be transformed into a chained form 
system [4]. Thus, the existing controllers derived for the 
nonholonomic chained form systems cannot be used here.■ 
Remark 2. Equation (1) is only an approximating model of 
rolling sphere under some proper coordinate transformations. 
For example, consider the nilpotent approximation model 
(20) derived in [17] (via the method developed in [25]). 
Then, equation (20) in that paper can be transformed into (1) 
by using the following coordinate transformations: 
)6/ˆˆˆˆ),ˆˆˆ(2,ˆ,ˆ,ˆ(),,,,( 33134325312321 zzzzzzzzzzzzzyx +++=  
and   ).,(),( 21 wwuv =  
    Although (1) is not an exact model of rolling sphere, it is 
hoped that the method proposed here can yield further 
insights into the design of complete model.                        ■ 
    In this section, we will first consider a special tracking 
problem. Toward this end, let us recall a class of periodic 
functions defined in [12] as follows. 
Definition 1.  For any positive constant M, let SM be the set 
of all continuous real-valued periodic functions h defined on 
),0[ ∞ that satisfy the following conditions: 
1) 0)(
0
=∫ dtthT , where T is a period of h. 
2) There exist two constants t0 and s0 such that h(t0)= M and 
h(s0)= M− .                                                                           ■ 
    Let Mrr Svu ∈,  be the desired control signals for some 
positive constant M with the same period T, and  
ττ dutx t rr )()( 0∫=  and 0,)()( 0 ≥∀= ∫ tdvty t rr ττ     (2)  
be the (virtual) tracking signals with respect to the state 
variables x and y, respectively.. By their definitions, we have  
               )()( tutx rr =&  and 0),()( ≥∀= ttvty rr& .              (3) 
Let us further assume that  
.0,0)()( ≥∀= ttvtx rr                                (4) 
Notice that, there are many possible choices to match these 
conditions. For instance, let ru  and rv  be two periodic 
functions with the same period T and over a period, they can 
be described as follows:

In view of (5)-(8), it can be seen that Mrr Svu ∈,  and (4) 
holds.  
Define an error state vector and new control variables 
as follows:

By employing (1) and (4), the following error model can be 
derived:

=&                    (11) 
Let 2/~ 2xV =  be a Lyapunov candidate. Using direct 
computation, it can be checked that  
 )].([~)](~[ 321321 yzxzzxyvyzxzzvuxV ere +++++++=&    (12) 
This suggests that the following controllers should be 
chosen: 
                           eur xkyzxzzvu −++−= )(~ 321                 (13) 
and                     )]([~ 321 yzxzzxykv ev +++−= ,             (14) 
with ku and kv being any positive constants. According to 
LaSalle invariance principle [9], the following result can be 
proposed. It will be used to derive a fast regulator in next 
section.  The proof is postponed to appendix.  
Theorem 1. Consider rolling sphere system (1) and its error 
model (11). With the controllers chosen as (13)-(14), 0~ =x  
is uniformly globally asymptotically stable and locally 
exponentially stable.                                                           ■ 
Remark 3. By using a result from [22], it can be concluded 
that the origin is globally K-exponentially stable.               ■ 
Remark 4. Equation (4) is a technique condition that was 
used to simplify the form of error model (11) as well as the 
design of the controllers.                                                            ■ 
Remark 5. It should be noticed that we just solved a tracking 
control problem with respect to a special trajectory in 
Theorem 1. It is interesting but not easy to attack the general 
tracking control problem. For our purpose, a partial solution 
is enough to be used in the regulation problem.                        ■

function on vI .  In view of (A2), we also have 
that rer yyyy =+=  is not a constant function on vI . Since 
x~  is a constant function, it can be derived from (A4) that  
                                  .031 ≡= zz                                      (A7) 
Since urr Ittutx ∈∀≠= ,0)()(& , there exists a non-empty 
open interval ux II ⊆  such that rx  is not a constant function 
and takes no zero value on xI . Again by (4), it can be seen 
that .,0)()( xrr Ittvty ∈∀==&  Notice that, ey  is a constant 
function and thus, er yyy +=  is also a constant function on 
xI . From (A2), it can be seen that for each 
,xIt ∈ )()()()( txtxtxtx rer =+= is a root of a fixed second 
order polynomial. Since rx  is continuous and is not a 
constant function on xI , this implies that the coefficients of 
the polynomial are all equal to zero. Particularly, 
.,0)()()()()( 231 xe Ittztztytzty ∈∀==+=  
Again using the fact that x~  is a constant function, it can be 
seen that  
                                  .02 ≡= zye                                    (A8) 
From (A2), (A7) and (A8), we conclude that 0~ ≡x  
whenever 0≡V& . Thus, the origin is uniformly globally 
asymptotically stable by LaSalle invariance principle or 
Krasovskii-LaSalle Theorem [9].  
    Now, let us show that the origin is locally exponentially 
stable. Consider the linearized system of the closed-loop 
system. It is not difficult to see that the linearized system 
takes the same form as the original system with the variables 
x and y replaced by xr and yr, respectively.  Thus, all previous 
arguments can be repeated with a minor modification to 
show that the origin of the linearized system is uniformly 
globally asymptotically stable. A detailed proof is omitted to 
save space. From this, the origin is locally exponentially 
stable [9]. This completes the proof of the theorem.           ■
