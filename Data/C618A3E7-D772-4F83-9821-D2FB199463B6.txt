elements in K(h) is given by J(h) = (r+h−1)!/(h!(r−1)!).
To ease the presentation, we adopt the short hand notations
displayed below:
k = k1k2 · · · kr
µk = µk11 µ

k − ei = k1k2 · · · (ki − 1) · · · kr
π(k) = (k1!)(k2!) · · · (kr!).
Associated with the r-tuple, we denote by P (k) the index
set of all possible membership permutations leading to µk =

P (k) = {i|(i1i2 · · · ir), 1 ≤ ip ≤ r, p = 1, 2, · · · , r}.
The number of the elements in P (k) for a d-dimensional
fuzzy summation is given by d!/π(k). For example, associated
with the 2-tuple (k1k2), the membership monomials leading
to µ1µ32 are
P (13) = {(µ1µ2µ2µ2), (µ2µ1µ2µ2),
(µ2µ2µ1µ2), (µ2µ2µ2µ1)}
= {(1222), (2122), (2212), (2221)} (1)
for a 4-dimensional fuzzy summation (i.e. d = 4). The number
of the elements in P (13) is given by 4!/1!3! = 4. Lastly, We
note that the notation (1) will be served as the indices for
matrices associated with the term µ1µ32. For example, (Y1222+

II. PRELIMINARIES
Before proceeding to the main result, the result known as
Po´lya’s Theorem [22] is rehearsed.
A. Po´lya’s Theorem based on Polynomial Theory
To begin, we introduce Po´lya’s Theorem [22] and its related
theorem [23].
Lemma 1 (Po´lya’s Theorem): [22] For a positive integer
r, ∆r := {(µ1, . . . , µr)|µi ≥ 0,
∑r
i=1 µi = 1}. If a real
homogeneous polynomial F (µ1, . . . , µr) is positive, then for
a sufficiently large d all the coefficients of
(µ1 + . . .+ µr)
dF (µ1 . . . µr)
are positive.
B. Literature Review
In this section, we review several important literature about
relaxations using slack matrices.
Given a typical closed-loop state-feedback T-S fuzzy control
system
σx(·) =
r∑
i=1
µiµj(Ai +BiKj) (2)
where the PDC controller is given by u =
∑r
i=1 µiKjx. Ap-
plying Lyapunov-based quadratic stability and relaxed method
[24] to the aforementioned fuzzy control system, we have
Mµµ < Yµµ < 0 (3)
By applying matrix-valued Po´lya’s Theorem, (3) leads to
(
r∑
i=1
µi)
dMµµ < (
r∑
i=1
µi)
dYµµ < 0 (4)
where for continuous-time systems

and for discrete-time systems
Mij =
[
−Q ⋆
AiQ+BiNj −Q
]
(6)
where Q > 0, Nj = KjQ and Yij are LMI decision variables.
III. MAIN RESULTS
The PD-LMIs (4) comprises of infinitely many LMIs, thus
being a feasibility problem of infinite dimensions. We need
to obtain a set of convex finite-dimensional LMI conditions
associated to PD-LMIs (4) so that the relaxation becomes
a finite-dimensional problem. The proposed methodology is
formally stated below.
Theorem 1: The closed-loop T-S fuzzy control system (2)
is quadratically stabilizable by state feedback control if there
exist matrices Nj , j = 1, 2, . . . , r; Yi and Q = Q′ > 0 such
that

system x˙(t) = A(t)x(t) and G is the weighting matrix
for state, which is to be selected in optimal control.
Corollary 2 (Time Derivative of P−1(t)): Given
the time-varying positive definite matrix P−1(t)
above, the time derivative of which is display below:

= A(t)P−1(t) + P−1(t)AT (t) + G. (3)
Identity (3) says that the time derivative of a time-
varying Lyapunov matrix P (t) can be expressed in
terms of system matrix A(t).
III. STABILITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we derive a stability condition for
an open-loop fuzzy system that is displayed below:
x˙(t) = A(t)x(t)
=
r∑
i=1
μi(t)Aix(t)
= Aµx(t), (for short-hand notation)
where constant matrix Ai is a system matrix of each
rule i and μi(t) ≥ 0 is the firing strength of rule i.
Theorem 1 (Stability Condition): The open loop
system (4) is stable if there exist symmetric, positive
definite matrices Qj satisfying the following LMIs:⎡
⎢⎣
(
(QiATi + AiQi) + (QjA
T
j + AjQj)
−(QjATi + AiQj)− (QiATj + AjQi)

⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦ > 0
(4)[
(QiATi + AiQi) Qi
Qi −(QiATi + AiQi)−Gii
]
< 0
(5)
Proof:
Consider a quadratic function
V (x(t))=xT (t)P (t)x(t), P (t) is a symmetric,
positive-definite matrix of time t, the time derivative
of V (x(t)) along the state trajectories is
V˙ (x) = x˙TP (t)x + xTP (t)x˙ + xT P˙ (t)x
= xT (AT P (t) + P (t)A + P˙ (t))x.
Based on Lyapunov theory, a sufficient condition is
AT P (t) + P (t)A + P˙ (t) < 0. (6)
Utilizing Schur complement, inequality (6) is equiva-
lent to
0 >
[
AT (t)P (t) + P (t)A(t) I

Applying Corollary 2 leads to

,
we arrive at[
P−1(t)AT (t) +  
P−1(t) −(A(t)P−1(t) + )−G
]
(8)
Letting P−1(t) = Q(t), we, thus, have[
Q(t)AT (t) +  
Q(t) −(A(t)Q(t) + )−G
]
< 0.
To continue, we parameterize the time matrixes as
Q(t) =
r∑
j=i
μjQj = Qµ
A(t) =
r∑
j=i
μjAj = Aµ
G =

M22 + M33 −M23 −M32 ≥ 0
M11 + M33 −M13 −M31 ≥ 0

This proves inequality (4). What follows is to

At the vertex [0, 1, 0]′
f(v2) =

⎤
⎥⎦
⎡
⎢⎣ 01
0
⎤
⎥⎦
= M2 + M22.
Similarly, at the vertex [0, 0, 1]′ we have
f(v3) = M3 + M33.
For r = 3, to ensure negativeness, we need
M1 + M11 < 0
M2 + M22 < 0
M3 + M33 < 0.
Paralleling the argument for r = 3, we arrive at the
following form for the general case.
Mj + Mjj
=
[
QiA
T
i +  
Qi −(QiATi + )−Gii
]
< 0.
This proves inequality (5).
Remark:
For a state feedback (u = Kx) stabilization problem,
simply replacing A with A + BK and following the
standard procedure used in state feedback will lead to
another set of LMIs.
IV. EXAMPLES
In order to appreciate the efficiency of the proposed
method, we consider examples where the T-S fuzzy
models are borrowed from existing papers.
A. Example 1
A continuous fuzzy system, borrowed from [16],
composed of the following two rules
R1 : IF x1(t) is M1, THEN x˙(t) = A1x(t)
R2 : IF x1(t) is M2, THEN x˙(t) = A2x(t)
The fuzzy sets are described by the following two
triangular membership functions:
μ1(x(t)) =
1 + sin(x1)
2
, μ2(x(t)) =
1− sin(x1)
2
and
A1 =
[
−5 −4
−1 −2
]
, A2 =
[
−2 −4
20 −2
]
the global T-S fuzzy model is:
x˙(t) = (μ1(x(t))A1 + μ2(x(t))A2)x(t)
Solving (4)-(5) and the following matrices are ob-
tained:
Q1 =
[
4.9248 −0.5812
−0.5812 4.9613
]
× 104
Q2 =
[
0.5156 0.1036
0.1036 2.3176
]
× 105.
By using the matlab LMI toolbox, one can easily
verify that for the common P solution, there exists
no positive definite matrix for the fuzzy system to
guarantee its stability. In other words, the fuzzy does
not admit a global quadratic Lyapunov function. But
by the proposed method, non-common Q1 and Q2
solution do exist and Fig. 4 depicts two stabilizing
Lyapunov functions involved and the simulation re-
sults shown in Figs. 2-3 indicate the system is stable.

systems. The proposed approach utilizes a premise-
dependent Lyapunov function to prove Lyapunov sta-
bility of the underlying fuzzy systems, leading to
a non-common P method that releases the conser-
vatism of the common P scheme. In addition, the
time-derivative dependence imposed by parameter-
dependent Lyapunov approach is removed. It is shown
and demonstrated via examples that the stability can
be determined by solving a set of LMIs.

2this section. In Section III, new stabilization conditions
to the underlying H∞ control system are shown. The
relaxation properties of the newly derived test condi-
tions, as opposed to existing stabilization conditions,
are discussed. One example is presented in Section
IV to illustrate the effectiveness and relaxation of the
derived conditions. Finally, Section V summarizes key
contributions of this paper.
Notations: The notation used is fairly standard.
We have Yμ =
∑r
i=1 μiYi and μi is the fir-
ing strength with
∑r
i=1 μi = 1, where Y =
{Aμ, B1μ, B2μ, C1μ,D1μD2μ, Fμ, Zμ}. r is the num-
ber of fuzzy rules. M ′ denotes the transpose operator
of a matrix M . And ∗ are terms that can be obtained by
symmetry. For example, A+B+CD+BT +DTCT =
A + (B + CD) +  and MTPM = MTP. δ is
the derivation operator for continuous-time systems
[δx = x˙(t)].
II. PRELIMINARIES
Consider the following fuzzy systems{
δx = Aμx + B1μω + B2μu
z = C1μx + D1μω + D2μu
(1)
and a PDC state feedback controller
u = Fμx (2)
For ease of presentation, a well-known common P
stability lemma is rehearsed first.
Lemma 1 (Continuous common P ): The system
(1) is stabilizable in an H∞ sense via state feedback
PDC law if there exists a positive-definite matrix X
satisfying the following LMIs, i, j = 1, · · · , r.

< 0
where
Mi = FiX.
Following is the second lemma that will be used in
deriving the main results.
Lemma 2: [25] Let λ(P ) be a matrix expression
that may relate to P , or may have nothing to do with
P . Then, there exists a positive-definite matrix P > 0
such that [
−λ(P ) ATP
PA −P
]
< 0 (3)
if and only if there exist a positive-definite matrix P >
0 and a matrix Z such that[
−λ(P ) ATZ
ZTA P − Z − ZT
]
< 0 (4)
Proof: (⇒) Necessity is proved by noticing that
feasibility of (3) implies existence of Z = ZT = P >
0 satisfying (4).
(⇐) Assuming that the inequality (4) is feasible, we
have Z + ZT > P > 0, which implies that Z is
non-singular. Since P is a positive definite matrix,
the inequality (P − Z)TP−1(P − Z) ≥ 0 holds,
establishing ZTP−1Z ≥ Z +ZT −P . Which, in turn
yields [
−λ(P ) ATZ
ZTA −ZTP−1Z
]
< 0 (5)
Recalling that Z is non-singular, letting T =
diag[I, Z−1P ] and forming T ′(5)T lead to inequality
(3).
To begin, we will state the following definition.
Definition 1 (Lie derivative): Let h : Rn −→ R
be a smooth scalar function, and g : Rn −→ Rn be a
smooth vector field on Rn, then the Lie derivative of
h with respect to g is a scalar function defined by
Lgh = ∇hg
where
∇h = ∂h/∂x
Similarly, if V is a Lyapunov function candidate
for the system, its derivative V˙ can be
written as LgV where x˙ = g(x). That is,
V˙ = LgV = ∂V∂x x˙ =
∂V
∂x g(x).
III. H∞ STABILITY ANALYSIS
We consider the following non-PDC state feedback
controller
u = FμZ−1μ x (6)
where Fi and Zi are controller gain to be determined.
The closed-loop system consisting of (1) and (6),
becomes {
δx = Aˆμx + B1μω
z = Cˆμx + D1μω
where Aˆμ = Aμ + B2μFμZ−1μ and Cˆμ = C1μ +
D2μFμZ
−1
μ .

T =

⎥⎥⎥⎦ .
Noticing that the upper 3 × 3 principle submatrix of
(12) bears the form of (3) and by Lemma 2, we have⎡
⎢⎣ −
−1I ∗ ∗

Forming T ′(13)T gives⎡

⎤
⎥⎦ < 0 (14)
where
T =
⎡
⎢⎣ I 0 00 0 I
0 I 0
⎤
⎥⎦
When replacing the 3 × 3 block matrix of (12) by
the left-hand side of (14), no violation occurs to the
aforementioned position and dimension criteria [26].
Thus, we have the following matrix inequality⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣

exchanges, we have⎡

< 0
Factoring the
∑
μi and
∑
μj out, we have the LMI
(7).
IV. AN EXAMPLE
In order to appreciate the efficiency of the propose
method, we consider an example borrowed from ex-
isting papers. Numerical comparisons with our results
and existing reports illustrate the relevance of this new
condition.
The following example, borrowed from the example
1 in [27] and modified, is used to demonstrate that the
proposed approach allows us to explore the feasible
solutions that existing techniques cannot.
The T-S fuzzy system has the following fuzzy rules:
R1 :If x1 is M11 THEN{
x˙ = A1x + B11ω + B21u
z = C11x + D21u
R2 : If x1 is M21 THEN{
x˙ = A2x + B12ω + B22u
z = C12x + D22u
(15)
where system matrices are borrowed and displayed
below:
A1 =
[
2 −10
2 0
]
, A2 =
[
a −5
1 2
]
B21 =
[

]
, B22 =

, B11 = B12 =
[
0
1
]
C11 = C12 =
[
1 0
]
, D21 = 0.03, D22 = 0.04
It is noted that the parameters a and b are further
adjusted to generate a family of controlled systems so
that comparison of feasibility regions can be made.
Figure 1, generated via the Lemma 1, reveals the
feasibility region by common P approach when pa-
rameters are varied. Figure 2 shows the parameter
regions where system stability is ensured by existing
common P relaxation [27]. It is noted that the relax-
ation technique shown in Theorem 2 [27] is adopted
and re-derived for Lemma 1. Thus Figure 2 is obtained
by Lemma 1 with relaxation technique introduced in
[27]. Figure 3, generated via the proposed Theorem
1, depicts that our technique can find feasible region
much larger than the existing common P methods.
Moreover assume b = 0, and our objective is to
check the H∞ performance of the above fuzzy control
system with different values of a. The minimum H∞
performance γ obtained by using Lemma 1, Theorem
2 (Relaxed Lemma 1) [27] and the proposed Theorem
1 ( = 0.0001) are listed in Table 1.

Theorem 1 0.1880 0.2146 0.2905 0.7307
Table 1 shows that the minimum H∞ performance
obtained by the proposed Theorem 1 is as good as
those obtained by Relaxed Lemma 1. The last two
rows in Table 1 show that, in this example, both
relaxed-common P and non-commom P mehtods
give same performance level, indicating the optimal
