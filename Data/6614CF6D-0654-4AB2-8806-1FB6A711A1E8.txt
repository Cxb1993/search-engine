Abstract 
This paper reports on an experimental finding concerning two states bi-stably existed at a fixed speed 
of flow over a circular cylinder in the pre-critical regime. The characteristics of the two states, named 
States A and B, respectively, were studied with pressure measurements and thermal tuft sensors on the 
circular cylinder, and hot-wire velocity measurements in the near wake region. While State B is 
identified as the sub-critical state, State A indicates the initial transition towards the critical regime. 
Using the present data analysis technique, the differences between the flow characteristics of the two 
states can be clearly revealed, which are described in terms of their Strouhal numbers, steadiness of the 
vortex shedding frequency and base pressure coefficients.  Physically, State A is featured with two 
separation bubbles situated symmetrically on the two sides of the circular cylinder.  Comparing the 
results obtained at two Reynolds numbers of State A, differed by 6% only, shows that the separation 
bubbles were situated at different locations, an indication that this flow phenomenon is very sensitive to 
Reynolds number.

in this regime, revealing that two separation lines at θ=73o and 92o could be clearly visible. While both 
studies indicate the presence of laminar separation bubbles on their circular cylinder models, 
respectively, the discrepancies between these two findings are worthwhile to be addressed below. 
Higuichi et al. (1989) suggested that a laminar separation bubble be occurred in the region of θ=88o-92o, 
whereas the flow visualization photo in Schewe (2001) indicated that a laminar separation bubble 
would be initiated at θ=73o. Moreover, Higuichi et al. (1989) pointed out that the presence of the 
laminar separation bubble is unsteady and three dimensional in nature. On the other hand, Schewe’s 
(2001) oil film visualization picture infers that the laminar separation bubble be steady and 
two-dimensional most likely.  
The Reynolds numbers of the present study fall in the same range as that those of Higuichi et al. 
(1989) and Schewe (2001). The results presented in this paper focus on an experimental finding of two 
states bi-stably existed at a fixed free stream flow speed, below which the flow shows the sub-critical 
behavior. Thus, this finding of a bifurcation process is deemed relevant to the initial transition from the 
sub-critical to the critical states. In the end, the present results show that the phenomenon observed is 
very sensitive to Reynolds number.  A discussion on this observation with those of Higuichi et al. 
(1989) and Schewe (2001) will be made. 
 
2. Experimental method 
The present experiment was carried out in the ABRI (Architecture and Building Research Institute) 
environmental wind tunnel, a close-loop design with two test sections arranged in series (Kao, 2005).  
The circular cylinder model employed was situated on a turntable.  The center of the turntable was at 2.9 
m downstream of the inlet of the first test section, which is 4m (width) by 2.6 m (height) in cross section.  
Spanning the top and bottom walls of the test section, the circular cylinder was made of acrylic, 300 mm 
in diameter, called D. By lathe machining, the accuracy of the roundness was about 1 μm.  The averaged 
height of roughness of the acrylic cylinder was 0.73 μm; the relative roughness, based on D, is 2.43×10-6. 
Therefore, this model can be regarded as a smooth cylinder. (ESDU 80025, 1980)

μm in thickness, deposited on a polyimide layer using a MEMS (Micro-Electrical-Mechanical-System) 
fabrication process. (Tu & Miau, 2009)  The total thickness of the MEMS sensor is about 20 μm.  Each 
film is of a dimension of 200 by 260 μm, with a cold resistance about 150 Ω.  This film was flexible, 
and could be applied on the cylinder surface without any difficulty.  
The Reynolds number, called Re, is based on D and Vref, where Vref denotes the reference velocity 
reduced from the pressure measurement at θ=0. Based on the definition of Cp below, the pressure 
coefficient Cp at θ= 0 is unity always.

In (1), P  denotes the time-averaged pressure measured on the cylinder, P0 denotes the static pressure 
of the free stream measured at the inlet of the test section and ρ denotes the density of the working fluid.  
In addition, Cp can also represent the real-time pressure coefficient, if P  in (1) is replaced by P, the 
real-time pressure measured on the circular cylinder. The definition of the base pressure coefficient, Cpb, 
is given in (2), where Pb denotes the time-averaged base pressure measured at θ=180

The presence of the circular cylinder in the test section caused a blockage effect. As a result, the Vref 
value reduced was higher than the free-stream velocity, which was measured by a Pitot tube situated at 
the inlet of the test section during the experiment.  The difference was about 5% over the Reynolds 
number range of the present interest. According to Miau et al. (2011), the blockage effect tends to be less 
significant as the Reynolds number gets higher toward the critical regime.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Observations of the discrete transition in the pre-critical regime 
Figure 2 presents the signal traces obtained at the pressure taps θ= 80o and 180o on the circular 
cylinder and the hot-wire probe in the near wake region, at Re=2.4×10
5
, in Series I experiment. All the 
7 
In figure 2, the velocity signal trace obtained by a single hot-wire probe at the edge of the wake 
shows larger fluctuations during the time period of State B compared to those during State A.  This 
implies that the wake width of State A is relatively narrowed. Conversely speaking, the hot-wire probe 
was situated further away from the wake shear layer.  This in fact conforms to the observation described 
earlier that the base pressure coefficient of State A is less negative than that of State B.  
 Figure 4 presents a set of the signal traces obtained in Series II experiment at Re=2.54×10
5
. All the 
signal traces shown, including those of the five pressure taps on the cylinder surface, the hot wire, and the 
MEMS thermal tuft sensors, were sampled simultaneously at a rate of 1 k/s for 120 seconds.  A discrete 
transition from States B to A is noted in the neighborhood of t=53 second. 
The Reynolds number at which the discrete transition took place in Series II experiment is actually 
about 5 % higher than that in Series I experiments.  This discrepancy was noted during the experiment, 
and repeated measurements were made for confirmation.  In fact, between these two series of 
experiments another set of measurements was conducted.  However, no bi-stable phenomenon was 
observed, despite that a considerable amount of efforts were made to search for such a flow condition.  
Our experiences indicate that searching for this phenomenon in experiment is always a time-consuming 
process.  
In figure 4a, the pressure signal traces obtained on both sides of the cylinder at θ=±80o, ±90o 
consistently show that the transition from one state to the other takes place synchronously in the 
neighborhood of t=53 second. This implies that State A is existed symmetrically with respect to θ.   
This symmetry behavior of State A was also pointed out by Higuchi et al. (1989), who attributed this flow 
characteristic to the development of small laminar separation bubbles on both sides of the cylinder.    
In figure 4b, the signal traces of the MEMS temperature sensors in the neighborhood of θ=±92o 
show an immediate change in response to the transition of the states.  In these plots, the vertical axis 
indicates a normalized temperature, Tn, defined below. 
Tn=(Volt’- Volt0)/( Volth- Volt0)                             (3)

respectively. Wl is about 60% of Wu only. This marks a distinct difference between States A and B.  The 
wake velocity profile of Re= 1.70×10
5
, which is of a sub-critical state, in the figure shows a good 
agreement with that of Re= 2.73×10
5
 in the region of y>0.            
Table 1 lists the Strouhal numbers and the base pressure coefficients of States A and B reduced from 
Series I, II, and III experiments for comparison; the measurements were made at the Reynolds numbers 
corresponding to the occurrence of the discrete transition.  As seen in the table, Sates A and B can be 
clearly differentiated in terms of the quantities presented.  
Figure 6 presents the base pressure coefficients obtained in Series II and III experiments at a number 
of Reynolds numbers, together with those reported in the literature (ESDU, 1980; Tsai, 2006; Bearman, 
1969; Güven, 1980; Farell and Blessman, 1983). In the figure, the ESDU data was reduced according to 
the surface roughness of the present acrylic cylinder.  A region marked in the figure indicates the range 
of Reynolds numbers where the discrete transition was observed in the present study. As seen, this region 
falls in the pre-critical regime, where the base pressure coefficients get deviated from the sub-critical 
level about -1.0.  
 
3.2 Instantaneous vortex shedding behaviors of States A and B 
In figure 3, the spectrum of State A contains much more fluctuating energy at low frequencies, 
compared to that in the spectrum of Sate B. This was noticed and further investigated with Wavelet and 
Hilbert-Huang transformations of the raw signals, which enabled us to look into the instantaneous flow 
behaviors of vortex shedding.  The results obtained in this respect are presented in this section. 
In figure 7, two segments of the pressure signals obtained at θ=80o corresponding to States A and B in 
figure 2, together with the instantaneous vortex shedding frequencies reduced by Wavelet transformation 
(Torrence & Compo, 1998), named fvW, are presented for comparison.  In the figure, the merit of using 
Wavelet transformation is immediately seen.  By this technique, the vortex shedding frequency at any 
time instant of interest, fvW, can be examined, in contrary to the result obtained by FFT analysis which 
gives only one single value of vortex shedding frequency, Fv, corresponding to the time-mean flow 
11 
shedding frequency are quite pronounced. In order to quantify these signal behaviors, a data analysis 
scheme using Hilbert-Huang transformation (Huang et al., 1998) was developed to examine the 
frequency components of interest embedded in the raw signals.  The Hilbert-Huang transformation is 
initiated with an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) procedure, which is able to decompose a 
continuous signal into a set of mono-components, called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs).  Each IMF 
contains no dc value, and is ready for Hilbert transformation to reduce for the instantaneous frequency 
and modulus. (Huang et al., 1998)   This technique has been successfully applied in previous studies 
(Hu et al. 2002; Miau et al. 2007) for analyzing the vortex shedding signals at sub-critical Reynolds 
numbers.   
In each of figures 9a and b, there are two IMFs presented, corresponding to the mono-components 
associated with the vortex shedding frequency and low frequency modulations, respectively.  As noted, 
these IMFs contain the most significant fluctuating energy among all the IMFs reduced from the EMD 
procedure.  Specifically, for the pressure signal trace obtained at θ=80o in figure 9a the fluctuating 
energy of the vortex shedding frequency and low frequency components are 19.5% and 16.5% of the total 
fluctuating energy, respectively; for the pressure signal obtained at θ=-80o in figure 9b the two 
components are 13.8% and 26.3%, respectively.  For either signal trace, there were 14 IMFs in total 
resulted from the EMD procedure.      
Time-lag correlation analysis was then carried out with respect to the IMFs in figures 9a and b.  
The results obtained with respect to the two IMFs of the vortex shedding frequency component are 
presented in figure 10.  As seen in the figure, the maximum negative correlation value takes place at 
zero time lag, about -0.59.  This basically evidences the anti-phase characteristic of vortex shedding in 
the flow.  Figure 11 presents the results obtained with respect to the two IMFs of the low frequency 
component in figures 9a and b.  The maximum correlation value is occurred at zero time lag as well, 
about 0.72, an indication of the in-phase characteristic of this fluctuating component measured on the 
positive and negative θ sides of the circular cylinder. Physical implication of this low-frequency 
component can be further elaborated below.  Wu et al. (2005) conducted a study on vortex shedding 
13 
in Series II experiment; the latter were reduced from the measurements obtained at Re=2.73×10
5
 and 
2.90×10
5
 in Series III experiment.  In Series II experiment, the output signal of the thermal tuft sensor at 
each θ location measured was sampled for 60 seconds, which was sufficient for obtaining a meaningful 
value of probability regarding the flow direction.  In Series III experiment, measurement at each θ 
location was conducted with a sampling time of 120 seconds.  However, it was found that this time 
length was not sufficient for obtaining a meaningful probability value when the measurements were made 
in the intermittent separation bubble region.  
Figure 12 shows that θ =77.5o is the most upstream location where the reversed flow was detected.  
In the vicinity of θ =80o, the probability of forward flow is about 50%, a reference for defining the 
time-mean flow separation point (Miau et al. 2006).  Basically, these findings are in good agreement 
with those reported in Miau et al. (2006) regarding laminar flow separation over a circular cylinder at 
sub-critical Reynolds numbers. As indicated in the figure, the region of θ =77.5o to 87.5o can be regarded 
as the intermittent flow separation region.  It is seen in the figure that the probability values reduced in 
the region of θ= 70o to 100o vary smoothly, an indication that the quality of the probability values reduced 
is acceptable.    
In figure 13a, the plot obtained at Re=2.73×10
5
 shows that the θ location corresponding to the on-set 
of reversed flow is at 82
o
, which is noted further downstream of that seen in figure 12.  Moreover, this 
distribution curve shows a hump around θ=87o-92o.    This appearance is similar to the results obtained 
by a surface fence probe at Re= 1.93×10
5
 in Higuchi et al. (1989).  A hump between the θ regions of no 
separation and fully separation implies the presence of a separation bubble in this region.  Higuchi et al., 
(1989) indicated that the separation bubble was situated in the region of θ=88o-92o. According to the plot 
in figure 13a, a separation bubble is likely to occur in the same θ region.  In addition, it should be 
mentioned that in the present study large variations of the probability values were actually observed at 
θ=87o and 92o, evidenced in the table included with the probability values of repeated measurements.  
Physically speaking, the separation bubble was not steadily present on the cylinder surface. This flow 
characteristic was also mentioned by Higuchi et al (1989).

upstream as the Reynolds number increases. For two Reynolds numbers differed by 6%, the θ regions of 
separation bubble are seen markedly different. Moreover, this finding serves to explain and resolve the 
discrepancy noted between the experimental observations of laminar separation bubbles reported by 
Higuchi et al (1989) and Schewe (2001).

DI water (pH=5.6) in sub-100 nm silica nanochannels can be reasonably neglected.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
As the dimensions of microfluidic channel downscale to nanometer regime, many unique 
properties of liquid flow transport phenomena have been reported.
1
 Examples of these properties 
include parabolic and reduced electro-osmotic flow (EOF),
2, 3
 increased viscosity,
2, 4, 5
 increased proton 
mobility,
6-8
 ion exclusion and enrichment,
9
 ion depletion and enrichment (i.e., ion concentration 
polarization),
10
 nonlinear electro-kinetic flow,
11
 and ion current rectification,
12
 shift of isoelectric point 
13
 etc. Most of these unique transport phenomena generally were attributed to the presence of a thicker 
(or an overlapped) electrical double layer (EDL) in the flow passage. The locally non-electroneutral 
region termed as EDL is created near the channel wall bearing the surface charges, and its size typically 
is of the order of several nanometers to hundred nanometers. When the channel size is almost 
comparable to the EDL (i.e., EDL overlaps in the flow passage), the surface charges have a significant 
impact on the ion distribution and transport via electrostatic interactions.
14
 As a result, it will create a 
considerable electro-kinetic effect on the liquid flow in the nanospace. For example, the 
electroviscosity (or electroviscous effect) due to the presence of streaming current/potential in the 
nanospace was considered to be one contribution for the increase in the viscosity of aqueous solution.
2, 
5
 As shown in Fig. 1, the streaming current ( strI ) is produced when the pressure-driven flow (PDF) 
carries the charges in the EDL towards the downstream end.
15
 Corresponding to this convective current, 
an electrical potential difference called the streaming potential ( str ) is produced between the ends of 
the channel. The action of the streaming potential produces an electrical current called the conduction 
current ( condI ) and a liquid flow called EOF in the opposite direction of the pressure drop. The overall 
result is a reduced flow rate in the pressure drop direction and results in the flow retardation 
phenomenon. It seems like that the liquid would have a higher viscosity compared to the intrinsic 
viscosity. This increase in apparent viscosity usually was referred to as electroviscous effect or 
electroviscosity.

 In this work, we will focus on the investigation of the electro-viscosity in 
nanochannels and ion-selective nanochannels/nanotubes (or nanopores) taking hydrodynamic slippage 
into account. The ends of these nanochannels and nanotubes are connected to two large wells (or

proposed an overlapped EDL model taking into account the conservation condition of ion number (e.g., 
salt ions, hydronium ion, and hydroxide ion), the dissociation of water, and the surface charge 
regulation (i.e., site dissociation). However, they didn’t notice that their adopted surface charge 
regulation model developed by Healy & White
24
 was derived in the open system, e.g., the reference 
electrical potential and ion concentration (e.g., hydronium ion) both were set to be the bulk value in the 
large well (reservoir). Here we think that their proposed model conflicts with Healy & White’s model. 
Further, Ren & Li
25, 26
 also extended this closed system concept to model the electro-viscous effect on 
liquid flow of dilute electrolyte solutions ( M10
6
0
c ) in small microchannels (14.1 and 40.5 μm). 
Their results are very particular compared to the traditional EDL knowledge, e.g., the potential gradient 
at the middle plane of slit is not equal to zero and there is a negative net charge density far away the 
negatively charged wall. In addition, Huang & Yang
27
 modified the bulk concentration of salt ion in the 
traditional PB formula based on the closed system concept and employed the surface charge regulation 
model proposed by Behren and Grier
28
 to develop an overlapped EDL model in nanochannels. Further, 
Wang et al.
16, 29, 30
 extended this EDL model to describe the electro-kinetic transport in nanochannels. It 
is noted that the wells connected to the ends of channel were not considered to develop the above new 
EDL model, i.e., the equilibrium between ionic solution in the wells and within the nanochannel is 
negligible in their proposed model. This may not be reasonable in reality because the wells generally 
are created to allow the liquid continuously flowing through the channel in experiments. As a result, 
some researchers have employed the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model to numerically investigate 
the electrokinetic transport phenomena in a nanochannel connected to the wells at the ends.
31-33
 More 
recently, Baldessari and Santiago
17
 developed a new EDL model considering the channel-to-well 
equilibrium and derived a semi-analytical solution for describing the overlapped EDL field. They 
argued that their proposed model is more appropriate to accurately describe the overlapped EDL field 
compared with the so-called “existing thick EDL model”2, 14, 18-21. According to the concept of the 
channel-to-well equilibrium, in this work, we will derive an analytical solution for the overlapped EDL 
in a nanochannel connected to two wells at either end, where the cation concentration may not be equal

 theoretically demonstrated that the efficiency 
was greatly enhanced in slip nanoslits and ion-selective nanopores. In this work, the liquid slip effect is 
also considered and the Navier slip boundary condition is employed to evaluate the electroviscosity in 
nanochannels/nanotubes. Compared to the non-slip condition, the results show that the slip charged 
nanochannel has a much larger electroviscosity. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the general governing 
equations for EDL and electroviscosity and derives the analytical solution and approximate solution of 
them in nanochannels where EDL overlaps. Section III presents the various analytical results of 
electroviscosity in nanochannels and nanotubes. The effects of a unipolar solution of counterions, 
slippage, and ambient atmospheric CO2 dissolution
7, 53, 54
 on electroviscosity are addressed. Finally, Sec. 
IV provides some brief concluding remarks.  
II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 
A. Poisson-Boltzmann model for overlapped EDL in nanochannels 
We consider a charged nanochannel connected to two relatively large wells at either end, as shown 
in Fig.1 (a). According to electrostatic theory, the electrical potential distribution ( ) in this channel 
system can be described by the Poisson equation:

the type-i ions, respectively. F  is the Faraday’s constant, l  is the dielectric constant of liquid, and 
0 is the permittivity of vacuum. Assume that the system is in equilibrium, the electrochemical potential 
( i ) of each ions i should be constant everywhere, i.e. 
0 i ,                                                               (2) 
where  Fziii  . i  is the chemical potential of the type-i ions, which is given by

Although 0  disappears in this compact form, but it will be considered as an “important” boundary 
condition later to solve the electrical potential distribution of the overlapped EDL field (see Appendix). 
Further, the net charge density is written as

0 can be obtained by solving Eqs. (12), (13), (15), and (17) together. Then, the overlapped EDL 
potential distribution ( ) and ion distribution ( c ) across the nanochannel height are obtained from 
Eqs.(12) and (8), respectively. When the volume of the wells is much larger than that of the channel 
(i.e., well ch2V V ) and the number of ions in the wells is much larger than the number of charges on 
the channel walls (i.e., well well ch2V zFc S  ),   ccc

zeta potential (the electrical potential defined at shear plane of EDL),

Meanwhile, the overlapped EDL potential and ion distributions across the channel height are also 
obtained.

In Eq. (22c), the first term represents the contribution from electromigration, while the second term 
represents the electrical conductance from the advection of charges driven by EOF. Substituting 
Eqs.(22a)-(22c) into Eq.(21), then the electroviscosity is obtained. 
C. Exact and approximate solutions of electro-viscosity in ion-selective nanochannels 
An ion-selective nanochannel usually refers to situation when the counter-ions (positive ions) 
strongly dominates the ion transport of a (negatively charged) nanochannel, i.e., the dimensionless 
Dukhin number
58
 (  ccDu e ) is much larger than unity, where c is the bulk concentration and 
Fhzce    is the excess ion concentration.
59, 60
 Note that the Dukhin number in general is more 
appropriate than the Debye-Hückel parameter ( Dh  ) to determine the ion-selective channel since the 
role of surface charge is not included in the latter. The co-ions ( c ) only have a negligible influence on 
the electrokinetic properties of a cation-selective nanochannel due to c c  inside the nanochannel. 
The liquid inside the channel can be regarded as a unipolar solution of counterions. As a result, Eq.(11) 
can be reduced to the following simplified PB equation

cm 1l , channel width μm 100w , channel height nm 1002 h , well diameter mm 4well D , and 
well depth mm 1well d . From Eq. (17), it can be seen that ion concentration of the well

    hRTzedyRTze

larger than 296 mV. As a result, we can infer that the condition of   ccc
wellwell
 (i.e., 1 ) 
almost is valid in most experiments on nanofluidics since the maximum zeta potential usually was 
measured on the order of several hundreds millivolts, i.e., the EDL overlap problem can be easily 
solved using the coupling of Eqs. (12) and (13). In this condition of   ccc

   , where  

EDL model is returned to the so-called “existing thick EDL model” or the traditional PB model. 2, 14, 
18-21, 62 
 
Further, we demonstrate the overlapped EDL model proposed by Baldessari & Santiago
17
 is the 
same as the “existing thick EDL model”. Figure 2 shows the comparisons between the results 
calculated from the present overlapped EDL model and Baldessari & Santiago’s model in the 
condition of   ccc

. Three models for predicting the zeta potential [Fig.2 (a)] and surface 
charge density [Fig.2 (b)] at the wall were employed, which respectively are the specific zeta potential 
( mV 159 ), specific surface charge ( 2mmC 39 ), and surface charge regulation model. The 
last model was derived from the silica surface site-dissociation reaction (SiOH SiO H

addition, the mobility of ions is assumed to be independent of the ion concentration and the location in 
this channel system.  
In the absence of slip, the electroviscosity of KCl solution in a 30 nm-height nanochannel as 
functions of the salt concentration ( KClc c ) and surface charge density ( ) is plotted in Fig. 3(a). In 
this work, the ion mobilities: 8 2
K
7.64 10 m Vsm 
   and 8 2
Cl
7.91 10 m Vsm 
   , and the liquid 
viscosity: 48.904 10  kg ms   , were used in the calculations. In Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that the 
electroviscosity increases significantly with decreasing the salt concentration, and then reaches a 
plateau at low salt concentration regime (or 1Dh   ). In the limit of thin EDL ( 1Dh  ), it is known 
that the electrical conductance of nanochannel is dominated by the bulk conductance and then reveals a 
scaling of nK hc . The advection of charges effectively driven by a non-slip PDF is increases as the 
salt concentration (EDL thickness) is decreased (increased) due to the presence of larger flow velocity 
near the centerline of channel, i.e, the streaming conductance has a scaling of 
str DS h h c     . Therefore, the streaming potential [Eq.(19)] increases with decreasing the 
salt concentration, i.e., the reverse EOF driven by the streaming potential and the electroviscosity both 
are increased. The reverse EOF can be scaled with 
22 2
eo str nQ S K h c    and the parameter in 
Eq.(21) has a scaling of  2 2 2Z h c  . In the limit of thick EDL ( 1Dh  ), the surface charge 
(counter-ion) governs (dominates) the ion transport,
14, 59, 60
 and then the electrical conductance and 
streaming conductance are scaled as 
nK   and 
2
strS h  , respectively, if we assume that the 
counter-ions have a uniform distribution inside the nanochannel. The reverse EOF reveals a scaling of 
4
eoQ h   and the parameter Z has a scaling of
2
Z h  . In the small-Z regime, the approximation 
of electroviscosity is given as 1a Z    . As a result, it is known why a   in Fig. 3 increases 
quadratically with decreasing the salt concentration and the channel height in the limit of 1Dh  . The 
electroviscosity in Fig. 3 (a) doesn’t depend on the salt concentration in the limit of 1Dh  , but it 
increases as the surface charge density is increased, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). However, it is 
55 
In Fig. 4, 1GCa   (low- a  limit) implies that the counter-ions have a more uniform 
distribution inside a nanotube. strS  and nK  are both linearly proportional to  . The streaming 
conductance is scaled as 3
strS a  . The electrical conductance contributed by EOF is negligible 
since a smaller value of   indicates a smaller EOF velocity. The electrical conductance is dominated 
by ionic electromigration and can be scaled as 
nK a   . The streaming potential is inversely 
proportional to , i.e., a larger value of   (or m ) results in a smaller streaming potential and a 
smaller reverse EOF. The reverse EOF is scaled with 5
eoQ a    and the approximation of 
4Z a m    is obtained from Eq.(33). Since a low- a   regime has a small value of Z, the 
increase in viscosity due to electroviscosity is approximately  a Z        . Then, we have an 
approximation of the increased viscosity due to electroviscosity in an ion-selective nanotube as: 
4a m      . Similarly, the approximation of    of an ion-selective nanochannel is 
obtained as 3h m   . As a result, it can be seen that the electroviscosity increases linearly with 
increasing a   ( h  ) in the low- a   ( h  ) regime in Figs. 3 and 4. In addition, we can simply 
estimate that the increased viscosity of an ion-selective nanochannel is approximately 1.3 times that of 
an ion-selective nanotube. While 1GCa  (high- a  limit) implies that most counter-ions are 
located within a thinner layer near the walls, strS slightly increases with   and it has a scaling of 
2 lnstrS a a   since the smaller flow velocity always appears in the proximity of the wall. The EOF 
contribution to the electrical conductance becomes considerable because a larger value of   yields a 
larger EOF velocity, i.e., the electrical conductance has a scaling of  1nK a   . As a result,

of  strS b h h . The amplified electrical conductance due to slip EOF is scaled as 
  
2slip
nK b h h  . This slip-amplified electrical conductance is not considerable in the 
low-b  regime (i.e., GCb  ) since the slip EOF is negligible. The electrical conductance is still 
dominated by the ionic electromigration and it has the same scaling as the non-slip condition [i.e., 
nK h m   in the limit of 1Du ], except it has a very much large slip length. In the limits 
of 1Du , 1 3b h  and GCb  , the approximation of  Z b h h m   is obtained, i.e., the 
electroviscosity doesn’t depend on the channel height but depends on the slip length and the surface 
charge density. This is why the electroviscosity shown in Fig. 5(b) increases very slightly as the 
channel height decreases (i.e., the slip ratio increases) for the lower surface charge density (or 
lower- b  ). Similarly, we also have an approximation of  Z b a a m  for the ion-selective 
nanotubes in the limits of 1 4b a  and GCb  . From Fig. 6, it can be seen that the 
electroviscosities of the ion-selective nanochannel and nanotube both increase linearly as the surface 
charge density is increased in the low-b  regime. In the low-b  regime, the electroviscosity in the 
ion-selective nanotube is comparable to the ion-selective nanochannel, as shown in Fig.6. When 
GCh   and b h   is gradually increasing (i.e., a high-b   regime), it is seen that the electroviscosity 
of an ion-selective nanotube is larger than an ion-selective nanochannel. This trend is very different to 
that observed in the non-slip condition. The main reason is that the amplification degree of the 
amplified streaming conductance due to slip (
slip no-slip
str str strS S  ) in nanotubes is larger than that in 
nanochannels, i.e.,    nanotube ln 2str GC GCb a e      , and    
nanochannel lnstr GC GCb h e      . 
In experiments, we infer that the apparent slip length ( ab ) for the salt (electrolyte) solution in 
charged nanochannels/nanotubes will be measured to be smaller than the realistic slip length (b ) due to 
the presence of the streaming potential or the reverse EOF. The relationships between the realistic slip 
length and the apparent slip length for the nanochannel and nanotube are, respectively, given by:

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In most experiments, the wells usually are created to connect the ends of a nanochannel, which 
allows the fluid continuously flowing in and out. Taking the equilibrium between the ions inside the 
channel and the ions in the wells into account, an overlapped EDL model for this nanochannel system 
based on the global electroneutrality and conservation of mass was developed in this work. For the 
large enough wells (i.e., well chV V  and then 
well wellc c c    ), the present model will be returned to 
the existing thick EDL model
2, 14, 18-21, 62 
or the traditional PB model. Further, we demonstrated that 
Baldessari & Santiago’s model17 in fact is the same as the existing thick EDL model. Based on this 
EDL model, we derived the analytical solutions to predict the liquid flow retardation due to 
electroviscosity in nanochannels and nanotubes. 
In the limit of 
well wellc c c    , we predicted the electroviscosity in a nanochannel, taking the slip 
effect into account. The predictions showed that the ion-selective nanochannels/nanotubes have the 
largest electroviscosity. In the absence of slip effect, the corresponding conditions for the maximum 
electroviscosity of the ion-selective nanochannel and nanotube are 
2
mCnm 32.0 h  and 
2mCnm 4.0 a , respectively. For LiCl solution, the maximum increase in viscosity due to 
electroviscosity in nanochannels (nanotubes) is about 60% (47%) of the intrinsic viscosity. When the 
hydronium ion dominates the ion transport, the electroviscosity is negligible since the increase in 
viscosity always is below 7% of the intrinsic viscosity. The electroviscosity in a nanotube usually is 
smaller than a nanochannel. In slip condition, the predictions showed the electroviscosity is greatly 
amplified. When the slip length is comparable to the nanochannel half-height or the nanotube radius, a
