(A) Two-glassy-phase bulk metallic glass with 
remarkable plasticity

Abstract Using the computational-thermodynamic 
approach, the potential compositions of Zr-Cu-Ni-Al alloy 
system exhibiting the two-liquid miscibility phase 
equilibrium in the liquid temperature region have been 
identified. The resulting Zr base bulk metallic glasses show 
a microstructure of two micro-scaled glassy phases. The 
glass possesses a high compressive strength and 
remarkable macroscopic plastic strain of 30% at room 
temperature. The gain of mechanical properties is 
attributed to the unique glassy structure correlated with the 
chemical inhomogeneity on the micron scale; the hard 
phases surrounded by the soft phases, leading to an 
inherent capability of extensive shear-band formation, 
interactions, and multiplication. 
 
One exciting benefit of preparing bulk metallic glasses 
(BMGs) is a tremendous gain in high yield strength. 
However, even for some tougher zirconium or palladium 
based metallic glasses, their applicability is limited by the 
lack of plasticity resulting from shear localization and 
work-softening [1-3]. To overcome this limited plasticity, 
two ways have been exploited: one is intrinsic toughening 
by increasing the Poisson’s ratio [4-5], and the other is 
extrinsic toughening by developing a composite 
microstructure within the glassy matrix [6-10]. Although 
the underlying deformation mechanisms are still not well 
understood, these studies are of scientific as well as 
industrial interests. In particular, the discovery of the 
super-plastic BMGs at room temperature sheds light that 
BMGs seems to have the potential to exhibit remarkable 
plasticity if some unique structures, e.g., a two-glassy 
phase structure, are available [4,10].  
In intermetallic alloys and ceramics, we can improve 
the mechanical properties by forming a duplex or 
multiphase microstructure which can provide effective 
obstacles for the propagating micro-cracks [11,12]. For 
BMGs, the nucleation and propagation behavior of shear 
bands is similar to the micro-cracks of crystalline materials. 
Following these ideas, the development of a 
two-glassy-phase microstructure is expected to be of 
potential interest in terms of the ductility improvement of 
BMGs. The early efforts to obtain two-glassy-phase BMGs 
usually involve the addition of alloying elements with a 
positive enthalpy of mixing into the master alloy systems 
and, thus, inevitably make the resultant BMGs to inherit 
inferior glass formation ability (GFA) [13-14].   
To overcome the dilemma, it is necessary to prepare 
dual-glassy-phase BMGs with high GFA. We note that the 
Zr–Cu–Ni–Al alloy system is a good candidate for this 
investigation, since it shows a high GFA and includes an 
atomic pair with a positive enthalpy of mixing between Ni 
and Cu elements [15]. But the positive heat of mixing 
between Cu and Ni is very slight, how to pinpoint the 
composition of an alloy exhibiting phase separation 
appears to be a scientific challenge.  
Yan et al. have explored a computational- 
thermodynamic approach to identify the potential 
compositions of Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu alloys exhibiting low-lying 
liquidus surfaces that favor the glass formation [16], in 
reasonable agreement with those determined 
experimentally by Lin and Johnson [17]. A salient feature 
of this approach is that the thermodynamic models of the 
phases implicitly incorporate the multiple chemical and 
topological interactions among component elements 
through the enthalpy and entropy terms. Before applying 
the method on the Zr-Ni-Cu-Al system, we need to employ 
a “thermodynamic description” concept on the basis of the 
description of a multicomponent system obtained by the 
Calphad approach [18-20]. For the quaternary system, 
there are 6 constituent binaries and 4 constituent ternaries. 
Using the quaternary thermodynamic description obtained 
and the commercial software Pandat [21], the isotherms 
and isopleths can be calculated.  
For the quaternary system, the complete isotherm is a 
tetragonal volume under a constant pressure, and, then, a 
two-dimensional section can be obtained from cutting with 
constant Al content. This will provide the information for 
the selection of alloy compositions. In this study, the 
selected “X” alloy (Zr63.8Ni16.2Cu15Al5) within the two 
immiscible liquid phase region (L1 and L2) can be found 
in the 1,050oC isothermal section, from which the isopleth 
cut for Al5Ni40Zr55 and Al5Cu25Zr70 composition regions is 
determined, as shown in Fig. 1. According to the diagram, 
the “X” alloy with the optimum composition of 
Zr63.8Ni16.2Cu15Al5 is located in the two-liquid-phase region, 
and the compositions of the two calculated liquid phases 
are Ni-rich Zr68.4Ni23.9Cu6.6Al1.1 and Cu-rich 
Zr61.7Ni12.8Cu18.8Al6.7, respectively.                                
Based on the selected optimum composition within the 
two liquid-phase region, Zr63.8Ni16.2Cu15Al5, cylindrical 
ingots of the Zr base BMGs, 2 mm in diameter, were 
prepared by arc melting the pure elements under a purified 
Ar atmosphere and in situ suction casting in a copper 
mould. The rod specimens with an aspect ratio of 2:1 were 
tested in compression under an initial strain rate of 2 x 10–4 
s–1 at room temperature.

branched, and the periodicity of the wave is about 0.5 ~ 1.5 
µm (Fig. 4(d)). The consistency between the wave 
periodicity of shear bands (0.5 ~ 2 μm) and the size scale 
of second glassy phase (around 0.5 ~ 1 μm) suggests that 
there exists strong interaction between shear bands and 
second glassy phases. Most interestingly, interaction of less 
wary shear bands is also observed in region II of the 
fracture surface, as illustrated in Fig. 4(e). This trend 
indicates a homogeneous nucleation and distribution of 
shear bands throughout the BMG to accommodate the 
applied strain rather than the accumulation of damage at 
some particular shear bands, as seen in monolithic BMGs 
[24,25].  
 
 
The HREM observations did not reveal nanocrystals 
even in heavily-deformed flakes. This trend indicates that 
the remarkable plasticity does not a result from the 
stress-induced nanocrystallization as found in other BMGs 
[26].  
We know that a direct result of the phase separation is 
the emergence of the regions with different chemical 
compositions, different coordinate numbers, and different 
closest neighbors. And this will cause the inhomogeneous 
distribution of hardness (and modulus) in the BMG. In this 
case, the softer Cu-rich glassy phase in the two-phase 
BMG is the glassy matrix with a brighter contrast, and the 
local hardness measured by nano-indentation for the bright 
phases is 5.22 ± 0.04 GPa, which is softer than that of the 
dark phases (6.17±0.04 GPa). They might possess different 
critical shear stresses (CSSs) for activating shear bands 
[27]. The softer glassy matrix should have more open free 
volumes, thus exhibiting a higher Poisson’s ratio, ν [28], 
which will benefit the initiation of shear bands due to the 
lower CSS. When yielding occurs, the relative soft glassy 
phase, i.e. the matrix in this case, will become 
preferentially the shear-transformation zones, serving as 
the nucleation sites for the shear bands. Consequently, 
abundant shear bands can be observed in the soft matrix 
regions, as shown in Fig. 4(c).  
On the other hand, there exists a large amount of well 
bonded interfaces between the two glassy phases in the 
current BMG. As a result, the shear-band propagation 
would be impeded by the second glassy phase clusters with 
a higher CSS, and this trend will alter the propagation 
directions and assist shear-band multiplication, resulting in 
the wave-like appearance of shear bands [Fig. 4(d)], as also 
observed by Xing et.al [9]. So the micron-scale 
inhomogeneity resulted from phase separation would 
possess the ability to hinder the propagation of shear bands, 
resulting in multiple shear banding. Finally, based on the 
concept of most shock wave propagations, any wave 
encounters an interface of another phase with a different 
composition or modulus, deflection and reflection of the 
initial wave would be induced. This effect would generate 
wave branching or deflection during the wave propagation. 
The rapid propagation of the shear band in BMGs could 
behave similarly to the shock wave propagation during 
high-rate deformation in many solid materials.  
The present work shows that, by the two-liquid phase 
separating based on the thermodynamic prediction, a 
good-GFA and ductile Zr BMG can be achieved from the 
two-glassy-phase microstructure. The two-glassy-phase Zr 
base BMG shows remarkable plasticity through the 
formation of a microstructure composed of hard regions 
surrounded by soft regions, which enables easy and 
homogeneous nucleation of the shear bands and continuous 
multiplication during deformation. The present results for 
the two-phase BMG are promising and demonstrate the 
possibility of designing other ductile bulk metallic glasses 
by the thermodynamic prediction.  
 
(B) Sample size effect and micro-compression 
of Mg65Cu25Gd10 metallic glass 
 
J.C. Lee, J.C. Huang, T.G. Nieh 
 
Abstract  Micro-pillars with a diameter of 1 and 3.8 μm 
were fabricated from Mg-based metallic glasses using 
focus ion beam, and then tested in compression at strain 
rates ranging from 6x10-5 to 6x10-1 s-1. The apparent yield 
strength of the micropillars is 1342-1580 MPa, or 60-100% 
increment over the bulk specimens. This strength increase 
can be rationalized using the Weibull statistics for brittle 
materials, and the Weibull modulus of the Mg based 
metallic glasses is estimated to be about 35. Preliminary 
results indicated that the number of shear bands increased 
with the sample size and strain rates. 
 
The strengths of face-center cubic (FCC) single 
crystals are known to be strongly dependent on the sample 
dimensions, especially when the dimension is close to 
micron or submicron scales [1-5]. For example, the 
strengths of Ni or Au micro-sized single crystal specimens 
are several times higher than that of the bulk specimens, 
and the strength can be even further increased by more 
than one order of magnitude in sub-micron pillar 
specimens. This dramatic effect occurs when the size of 
samples smaller than the characteristic length for 
multiplication, which results in the dislocation starvation.

where P and hΔ  are in the units of Newton and meter, 
respectively. Thus, the elastic modulus is the slope of 
load-displacement curve multiplied by a constant of 
2.64x1012, which is about 41 GPa. However, the above 
calculation was based on a rigid substrate. In our case, the 
substrate is also the same Mg-BMG.. Under such a 
condition, according to a finite element analysis of 
micro-compression [11], the actual Young’s modulus 
should be corrected by a factor of about 1.25. This results 
in a value of 51.3 GPa which is in excellent agreement 
with the literature value of 50.6 GPa measured from bulk 
Mg-BMG sample [12].  
Since the sample is tapered, yielding will, in principle, 
start from the top of the sample because this is the location 
with the minimum cross section. The departure load 
divided by the top area is then the “apparent” yield strength. 
Despite a slight variation, the apparent yield strengths of 
the 3.8 and 1 μm pillars range from 1342 to 1580 MPa, 
which are much higher than that for the bulk Mg65Cu25Gd10 
samples, which is about 800 MPa [13]. These data are 
summarized in Table I. The current result of improved 
strength caused by a decrease in sample size is in accord 
with a previous study on mm-scaled BMG [8]. Also noted 
in Table I is the fact that the average strength of the 1 μm 
pillar (~1500 MPa) is higher than that of the 3.8 μm pillar 
(~1390 MPa). This demonstrates that the sample size effect 
can extend from the mm to μm range. The strength 
improvement from mm-scaled sample to μm-scaled pillar 
is noted to be about 60-100%, which is quite remarkable.  
 
 
 
 
After yielding, the load remains essentially constant at 
different strain rates; as evident in Fig. 2. The 
corresponding engineering stress-strain curves, not shown 
here, have a similar shape. This particular shape of 
stress-strain curve usually, according to the conventional 
wisdom, leads to a conclusion that BMG behaves like a 
perfectly plastic material. However, the raw 
displacement-time data, as given in Fig. 4, seem to reveal a 
different message. Specifically, data in Fig. 4 indicate the 
displacement (or strain) takes place almost instantly. In 
other words, strain does not occur in a gradual fashion but 
in the form of burst, even though the tests were conducted 
under strain rate control conditions. Every strain burst 
event, regardless of the strain rate, proceeds within about 
one second, suggesting the strain rate during these bursts 
was at least 10-1 s-1. There is also a notable trend that, for 
both micro-pillars, a faster compression rate results in a 
larger strain burst. The instant strain burst is peculiar but is 
usually indicative of a sudden propagation of a localized 
shear band [9].  
The morphology of compressed pillar samples is 
shown in Fig. 5. It is well known that bulk Mg-BMGs 
generally fracture into fragments at the onset of yielding 
since they have a low Poisson’s ratio ~0.32 [14]. However, 
the present micropillar samples do not exhibit such a 
catastrophic fracture mode even at a “macroscopic” strain 
of 10-15%. In fact, all of them deformed by macroscopic 
shear, presumably resulted from localized shear band 
propagation. In principle, shear band is anticipated to 
initiate from the corner of contact between specimen and 
compression punch, as marked in Fig. 3. This is the 
location where the sample experiences the maximum stress, 
not only because it has the minimum cross section as a 
result of sample taper, but also due to the large constraint

been discovered, including Ti, Zr, Fe, Pd, Mg, Cu, Ni, and 
other metallic glass alloy systems. [2-4] BMGs have 
attracted much attention due to their unique properties, for 
example, their superior strength and high hardness, 
excellent corrosion resistance and high wear resistance. 
Recently, many techniques have been used successfully to 
prepare Ti-based BMGs, but most of the research efforts 
and industrial interests are focused on different 
implementations of rapid solidification. [5] An alternative 
method uses solid-state amorphization processing, as in 
mechanical alloying (MA), to prepare amorphous powders 
that are suitable for further compaction and densification. 
Meanwhile, reinforced particles can be introduced easily 
into the glassy matrix. As previous investigations have 
demonstrated, MA has been used successfully to prepare 
amorphous Cu- and Zr-based composite powders. [6, 7] 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been one of the most 
actively studied materials in contemporary research. These 
structures have good chemical and physical properties 
potential applications in many different fields. CNTs, with 
their superb electronic, mechanical, and structural 
characteristics, are strong candidate components for new 
functional devices, such as field emission displays, 
nanoscale transistors supercapacitors, [6-8] secondary 
batteries, and various composites. [8-10]  
Even though BMGs and CNTs have many excellent 
properties, a literature survey indicated that no report exists 
on the formation of a Ti-based BMG composite powder 
containing CNTs using the MA process. In this work, 
amorphous Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powders with and without 
CNT additions will be prepared using MA. Subsequent 
consolidation of as-milled powders will be performed and 
the mechanical property of compacts will be evaluated by a 
Vickers microhardness and compression tests. 
 
II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The XRD patterns of the elemental powder mixture 
with a composition Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 after milling for 8h are 
shown in Fig. 1 (a). Only a broad diffraction peak appears 
around 2θ = 42 deg, indicating that fully amorphous 
powders have formed. In the case of the composite 
powders, as seen in Figs. 1(b) and (c), no diffraction peaks 
for the crystalline CNT can be detected in the XRD 
patterns for the composite powders of Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 
alloy mixed with 4 and 8 vol. % CNT after 8h of milling. 
This may be attributed to the small volume fraction of 
CNT particles and their small crystalline size. Lin et al. [11] 
reported that, for small Al2O3 additions in mechanically 
alloyed Ni-Al alloys, no Al2O3 phase can be detected by 
XRD after 10 h milling. This is similar to what was 
observed in this work for the preparation of the NiAl-Al2O3 
intermetallic-matrix composite. The XRD spectra of the 12 
vol. % CNT -containing powders are also depicted in Figs. 
1 (d). The 12 vol. % CNT -containing powders exhibit a 
broad halo peak, superimposed by sharp diffraction peaks, 
which are identified as TiC, suggesting the presence of a 
mixture of the amorphous and TiC crystalline phases. In 
order to observe the microstructure within the bulk metallic 
glasses, Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 and its composite with 12 vol.% 
CNT additions, i.e., the corresponding sample as shown in 
Figs. 1, was examined by transmission electron microscope. 
As shown in Fig. 2, a typical “salt and pepper” 
microstructure representing a homogeneous amorphous 
phase was observed for the TEM micrographs of 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powder. For composite powder with 12 
vol. % CNT, as revealed by TEM in Fig. 2b, the TiC 
nanoparticles with irregular shapes and size raging around 
20 ~ 40 nm were embedded and homogeneously 
distributed within the amorphous matrix. The insert 
included in Figure 2(b) presents the selected area 
diffraction (SAD) pattern taken from matrix, where a 
typical amorphous representing diffuse halo with the ring 
patterns of crystalline TiC can be noticed. The results 
indicate that the introduction of carbon induces the in-situ 
formation of TiC particles, while the Ti-based 
multicomponent matrix remains as amorphous due to its 
high glass-forming ability. By the Miedema model [16], 
the mixing enthalpy (kJ/mol) is calculated for Ti-C: -92, 
Ti-Cu: -9.6, and Ti-Ni: -34, respectively. This means in the 
current work, during the course of the in-situ reaction, 
there is a greater chance for Ti than Cu, Ni and Sn metal to 
interact with C, which leads to the precipitation of TiC 
particles in the amorphous matrix. A similar behavior has 
been reported by Wang et al. [17-19] who examined 
Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni-Be with carbon and Zr-Cu-Ni-Al-Ti with 
carbon nanotube. 
Differential scanning calorimetry was used to 
investigate the glass transition and crystallization behavior 
of the as-milled powders. The DSC scans of the 8h 
as-milled Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 monolithic glass and the 
composites with CNT particles are shown in Figure 3. The 
glass transition (Tg) and crystallization (Tx) temperatures 
are defined as the onset temperature of the endothermic 
and exothermic DSC events, respectively. The Tg and Tx 
are 719 and 765 K, respectively, for the Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 
without CNT particles, and 746 and 790 K for the 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 with CNT particles. The values of Tg and 
Tx of the composite powders are higher than that of the 
single-phase amorphous Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 alloy. The 
addition of CNT particles into the glassy matrix induces a 
shift in Tg and Tx to higher temperatures. This suggests that 
a small amount of CNT might be alloyed into the matrix 
upon milling, thus changing the overall composition of the 
glassy phase. However, the supercooled liquid region (ΔTx 
= Tx - Tg) for composite powder remained almost 
unchanged. Similar behavior was reported for small ZrC 
additions in a Zr-Al-Cu-Ni alloy. [12]  
Based on the DSC results, the 8h as-milled 
composite powders were consolidated into a disk with 10 
mm diameter and 2 mm thickness by vacuum hot pressing. 
Figure 4 shows the consolidated sample of the bulk 
metallic glass composite, which exhibited a smooth outer 
surface and metallic luster. X-ray diffraction and 
differential scanning calorimetery were performed to 
confirm the amorphization status of the consolidated 
samples. Though not shown here, consolidated BMG

Abstract. The microstructures and mechanical properties 
of Ta-W thin films sputter deposited at two substrate 
temperatures, 296 and 773 K, were investigated. Whereas 
the 298 K sample is crystalline, the 773 K sample has an 
amorphous structure. Hardness and Young’s modulus of the 
nanocrystalline Ta-W thin film were determined to be 
14.29 GPa and 181.73 GPa, respectively. These values are 
about 20% and 10% lower than that measured from the 
amorphous counterpart. 
 
1.  Introduction 
Tantalum and tantalum-tungsten alloys are attractive 
because of their high density, high elastic modulus, high 
melting point, low ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, 
high ductility, good workability, good welding properties, 
good corrosion resistance and high strength at high 
temperatures [1-5]. These attributes have made crystalline 
Ta-W alloys one of the most attractive materials used for 
aerospace, defense, and nuclear industries [5-7].  
Compared to their micro counterparts, nanocrystalline 
(nc) materials have shown unusual mechanical properties 
such as high strength, increased resistance to tribological 
wear [8], excellent formability at high temperatures [9]. 
These superior properties drive the development of various 
techniques for the synthesis of nc materials. 
Electrodeposition has probably been one of the most 
successful methods to produce nc materials with fine grain 
size down to 6 nm. Alloying often can further reduce the 
grain size down to the amorphous limit [8]. Tantalum has a 
body-centered structure with a high affinity for interstitial 
gases (e.g., O, N, H, and C). These impurities can either 
dissolve extensively in Ta to form a solid solution or react 
with Ta to form stable compounds [6]. Traditional powder 
metallurgy technique inevitably introduces impurities. In 
contrast, Magnetron sputtering method can produce pure 
alloys with a full density in the form of thin films [10]. A 
deposited film can also keep a uniform chemical 
composition. 
To the best of our knowledge, mechanical properties 
of nc and amorphous Ta-W alloys have not been reported. 
In the present paper, we study Ta-W alloy films deposited 
at different substrate temperatures. Microstructures of these 
films were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties of 
these alloys were characterized using nanoindentation 
techniques.

solid solution effect is overwhelmed by the grain size 
effect in the current alloy. This negligibly small solid 
solution effect is due to the symmetric strain field 
associated with a substitutional element, which has weak 
interaction with dislocations. Similar weak hardening by W 
substitutional solute has also been observed in direct 
current electrodeposited nc Ni [8]. 
It is interesting to note that both the hardness (17.11 
GPa) and Young’s modulus (200.52 GPa) of the amorphous 
Ta-W film are higher than that of the nc Ta-W film. 
Specifically, they are about 20% and 10% higher, 
respectively. Based on the pile-up model, it was pointed 
out that the maximum strength of a solid occurs at a grain 
size dc according to the equation [18]:   
app
c
Gbd συπ
1
)1( −= ········································· (4) 
where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burgers vector, ν is 
the Poisson’s ratio, and σapp  is the external applied stress. 
Insert yield strength of 460 MPa for a coarse-grained Ta-W 
[19] in the above equation for σapp, the critical grain size dc 
is estimated to be only about 22.9 nm. Thus, Ta-W film 
with a grain size of 35.9 nm does not possess the maximum 
strength. In fact, it is even softer than the amorphous Ta-W 
film. A higher modulus value in the amorphous film is, 
however, difficult to explain. The modulus of the 
amorphous Ta-W should be, in principle, lower than that of 
the crystalline Ta-W. However, experimental data show the 
opposite. Presently, it is not clear about this discrepancy.  
4.  Summary 
A final note is about the amorphous structure in the 
Ta-W film sputter deposited at 773 K. Solid-state 
amorphization has been reported in some binary Ta-X 
systems, such as Ta-Au and Ta-Y [20], but not in a Ta-base 
solid solution system. We repeated the deposition 
experiment of Ta-W at 773 K several times and the 
amorphous structure appeared reproducible. However, 
when we annealed the room-temperature-deposited nc 
Ta-W films at temperatures of 673 K, 773 K and 873 K, the 
XRD patterns were all showing a crystalline structure. This 
suggests that different thermal processing paths can lead to 
different structures. It would be of great scientific and 
technical interest to identify the crystalline-amorphous 
transition in the Ta-W system. The study is currently 
underway.

present a onset temperature of viscous-flow (Tonset) about 
451 K. Base on the result of TMA, the deformation 
behavior for Mg58Cu31Nd5Y6 BMG rod was investigated by 
compression test with different strain rate (2.5 x 10-3 ~ 1 x 
10-2 s-1) at various temperature near the Tonset (namely 438, 
443, 448, and 458 K) in the supercooled liquid region. The 
value of flow stress with a constant strain rate of 2.5×10-3 
s-1 presents a decreasing trend with increasing temperature 
and reaches a quite low flow stress of 5 MPa at the test 
temperature of 458 K. On contrary, the value of flow stress 
increases with the strain rate of compression. In addition, 
the superior superplastic forming ability of the 
Mg58Cu31Nd5Y6 BMG was observed and demonstrates that 
excellent workability of this BMG at the supercooled 
liquid region. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  
  The alloy ingots based on the compositions of 
Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 by atomic percentage were firstly prepared 
by atmosphere-controlled induction melting of the 
appropriate mixture of pure elements. Then the alloy ingots 
were remelted in an induction furnace under a purified 
argon atmosphere. After complete melting, the liquid alloy 
was injected into the water-cooled Cu mold to form alloy 
rods with a size of 4 mm in diameter x 50 mm in length. 
These as-cast BMG rods were characterized by TMA 
(Thermal mechanical Analyzer, PerkinElmer Diamond 
TMA), under the pressure from 7.98 kPa to 79.8 kPa in an 
argon atmosphere using a ceramic-cylinder pressure vessel 
at a heating rate of 0.67 K/s. Each sample was heated up to 
573 K which is above the glass transition temperature (Tg). 
In order to assure the accuracy of TMA, both side of each 
sample were cut to be parallel and carefully polished to 
insure the flatness. Several temperatures between Tg and 
crystallization temperature (Tx) (namely 443, 448, 453 and 
458 K) were selected for high temperature compression 
tests by a MTS-801 mechanical test system with strain 
rates of 2.5×10-3~1×10-2 s-1 to study the deformation 
behavior within the SCL region. The compression samples 
with the height to diameter ratio of 2:1 (h = 8 mm and d = 
4 mm) were cut to be parallel and carefully polished to 
insure the flatness from the as-cast Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG 
rod. Finally, the hot-compressed samples were examined 
by X-ray diffraction (Scintag X-400 X-ray diffractormeter) 
with monochromatic Cu-K radiation. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Fig1. shows the combination of DSC and TMA 
curves for the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG at the heating rate of 
0.33 K/s and l00 mN stress (7.96 kPa‧s). Before Tg, the 
linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for 
amorphous solid is αg = 1.78 x 10-6 m/mK. Above Tx, the 
CTE for crystal solid is αc = 5.85 x 10-5 m/mK, suggesting 
that the CTE is in agreement with the common Mg alloys. 
As increasing temperature, the relative displacement keeps 
almost constant below Tg temperature. However, the 
relative displacement is enhanced appreciably with 
increasing magnitude of loading and temperature; 
especially approaching the Tonset (the onset of viscous flow 
occurs around 450 K). The deformation of viscous flow is 
formed when the glass structure becomes viscous matter, 
namely inhomogeneous deformation transforming into 
homogeneous deformation. In parallel, the relative volume 
of the compressive deformation is enlarged about ~-7.2% 
over the transition temperature interval from 450 to 490 K. 
The relative displacement as a function of temperature 
which obtained from TMA for the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG 
rod with different compressive stress (namely 7.96, 15.92, 
23.88, 39.8, and 79.6 kPa) at the heating rate of 0.67 K/s is 
shown in Figure 2. It reveals that the amount of 
deformation strain increases with the compressive stress. In 
addition, to convert the foregoing result of Figure 2 into the 
plot of viscosity versus temperature by the equation of 
•= ε
ση flow  (in which fiowσ  is flow stress and ε•  is 
strain rate), as shown in Figure 3. There is a clear transition 
of viscosity change at Tg, the glassy solid exhibits the rigid 
matter at the temperature below Tg and becomes viscous 
matter in the supercooled liquid region, as shown in Figure 
4. A relatively low viscosity between 106~107 
sPa • occurs at the temperature interval of supercooled 
liquid region. As the temperature approaching to Tx 
(namely 490 K), the viscosity of the BMG sample 
increases rapidly back to 1010 sPa •  due to the 
crystallization and becomes a rigid matter again.  
Base on the result of TMA, the viscous flow behavior of 
Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG rods were investigated by 
compression test with different strain rate (2.5×10-3~1×10-2 
s-1 ) at various temperature near the Tonset (namely 438 K, 
448 K, 453 K, and 458 K) in the SCL region. The true 
stress-strain curves of the BMG samples deformed at 438 
K, 448 K, 453 K, and 458 K with different strain rates 
between 2.5×10-3 and 1×10-2 s-1 are shown in Fig.4 (a)~(d), 
respectively. Typically, all stress-strain curves show a yield 
peak of stress at the beginning of compression and 
significantly reducing the stress to a stable and relatively 
low value with increasing strain. In addition, the flow 
stress also decreases clearly with compressive strain rate 
and compression temperature. As a result of compression 
test, the plastic strain around 80% ~ 160% can be obtained 
easily at various temperature and strain rate. A typical 
deformed sample at 458 K with a strain rate of 1×10-2 s-1 is 
shown in Fig.5. Moreover, the X-ray diffraction reveals 
that there is only a broad diffuse peak is observed in the 2θ 
range of 30°- 50° for the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 alloy rods 
compressed at 458 K and various strain rates as shown in 
Figure 6. 
To further discuss the flow behavior of the BMG, the 
Backofen function is introduced [23].

1) alloy (as shown in Fig. 1(b) and(c)) shows the 
characteristic shining surface.  
The DSC scans of the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix (x = 
0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) amorphous alloys rods with diameter of 
4 mm are shown in Figure 3. All of the samples exhibit a 
clear glass transition followed by a supercooled liquid 
region and then exothermic reaction due to crystallization. 
In addition, the lowest liquidus temperature (about 1132 K) 
occurs at the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.5Si0.5 alloy, as show in 
Table 1. According to the analyses of Turnbull [13], the 
best metallic glass forming alloys are at or near deep 
eutectic composition and also result in obtaining highest 
reduced glass transition temperature Trg (Trg = Tg/Tl). This 
implies that the alloy (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.5Si0.5 would retain 
a high glass forming ability. 
According to the result of DSC analysis in Table 1, 
the value of GFA index, γ(

with the silicon additions and reach to the optimum value 
of 0.430 and 0.774, respectively at the 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99Si1 amorphous alloy. In comparison the 
value of γand γm with the base alloy, it is suggested that the 
Si element present a positive effect on increasing GFA in 
the Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8 alloy system. 
The activation energy of crystallization for the 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) alloys was 
determined by means of the Kissinger plot [16],  
ln(b/T2) = - Ea/RT + constant                (1) 
Where b is the heating rate, T is the specific temperature, R 
is the gas constant, and Ea is the activation energy. By 
substituting T with Tp (peak temperature of crystallization) 
in equation (1), the activation energy of crystallization can 
be determined from the slope of a plot of the ln(b/T p 2) 
against 1/Tp. The ln(b/T p 2) as a function of 1/Tp is plotted 
in Figure 4(a). Figure 4(b) shows the activation energy of 
crystallization calculated by Kissinger plot as a function of 
Si content for (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix alloys. The 
activation energy of these (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix alloys 
increases with Si content and reaches the maximum (294 
kJ/mole) at the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.75Si0.25 alloy. This 
indicates that the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.75Si0.25 may have the 
best thermal stability for the(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix alloy 
system.  
By using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) isothermal 
analysis for volume fraction x transformed as a function of 
time t based on the following equation (2): 
][-(kt)- x(t) nexp1=     (2) 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix amorphous alloys were annealed 
isothermally at several temperatures between Tg and Tx. To 
construct the JMA plots, the volume fraction of 
crystallization at time t was assumed to be the same as that 
of heat released. Therefore, the volume fraction of 
crystallization x which obtained by measuring the partial 
area under peak up to time t versus as the annealing time is 
plotted as shown in Figure 5. In parallel, the incubation 
time as a function of isothermal annealing temperature 
exhibits an increasing trend with Si addition as shown in 
Figure 6. This indicates that the optimum thermal stability 
may occur at the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSi0.75 amorphous 
alloy. Since the covalent atomic radius of Si (0.132 nm) is 
just between the atomic group of [Zr (0.160 nm), Al 
(0.143nm)] and [Cu (0.128nm ), Ni (0.125 nm)], that the 
addition of Si would increase the packing density of the 
base alloy. In addition, both of the Zr-Si (-67 kJ/mole) and 
Ni-Si (-23 kJ/mole) binary system has a large negative heat 
of mixing [17] which can form strong atomic bonding of 
Zr-Si and Ni-Si atomic pairs. Therefore, the increase of 
thermal stability for the base alloy with Si addition is 
suggested contributing by the increase of their atomic 
packing density as well as their Zr-Si and Ni-Si strong 
atomic bonding. This evidence is in agreement with the 
previous report [10,18], Si would present a positive effect 
on improving the thermal stability of some Zr-based 
BMGs.  
 
CONCLUSION 
Base on the results of thermal analyses, X-ray 
diffraction, and TEM observation for the 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) amorphous 
alloys, the effect of microalloying with Si on the glass 
forming ability and thermal properties can be summarized 
as follows: 
(1) The value of GFA index, γ (γ =Tx/Tg+Tl) and γm all 
exhibit an increasing trend with the silicon additions and 
reach to the optimum value of 0.430 and 0.774, 
respectively at the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99Si1 amorphous alloy. 
This implies that the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.5Si0.5 alloy has the 
highest GFA (glass forming ability) in this series alloys. 
(2) Both of the activation energy of crystallization and 
the incubation time of isothermal annealing these 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix amorphous alloys indicates that the 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.75Si0.25 alloy posses the best thermal 
stability in the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)100-xSix alloy system. The 
increase of thermal stability for the base alloy with Si 
addition is suggested contributing by the increase of their 
atomic packing density as well as their Zr-Si and Ni-Si 
strong atomic bonding.

Hydrogen Effects on Mg, Al and Zr based 
BMG and Nanocrystalline Alloys  
 
Jiann-Kuo Wu and Chia-Po Hung 
 
Abstract The corrosion behavior of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 and 
(Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were 
studied in 3.5%NaCl, H2SO4 and NaOH solutions. The 
results of cyclic potentiodynamic polarization test showed 
excellent corrosion resistance of the (Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 
BMG in 3.5% NaCl, H2SO4 and NaOH solutions due to the 
formation of better protective films. (Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 
has higher pitting potential in 3.5% NaCl and lower 
passivation current density in H2SO4 and NaOH solutions, 
compared with Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5. Adding 2% Er to Zr-baesd 
BMGs, shows the beneficial effect on corrosion resistance 
of Zr-based BMGs. 
 
Introduction 
Bulk metallic glasses are a new class of metallic materials 
with excellent chemical, physical and mechanical 
properties for functional and structural applications [1-7]. 
Amorphous alloys have been successfully produced in bulk 
sizes for many alloy systems including Mg, Al, Fe, Ti and 
Zr- based alloys. Nanocrystalline states can be obtained by 
these amorphous alloys [8]. The amorphous state and 
nanocrystalline alloys both attract our attention due to their 
excellent performance. In our previous results, corrosion 
properties and hydrogen embrittlement of some Zr [9], Fe 
[10-11] and Pd [12] based alloys have been reported. 
Zr- based amorphous alloys have been proposed for 
biomedical application because of their good 
biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties and high 
polarization resistance in an artificial body fluid [13-15]. It 
was found that the addition of Er greatly enhanced the 
mechanical properties of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 alloy [16]. In this 
study, we focused on the effect of Er (erbium) addition on 
the corrosion improvement of Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 in various 
aqueous solutions. 
 
Experimental Procedures 
Zr based bulk metallic glasses specimens were cast with 
8mm x 4.5mm x50mm and a diameter of 6mm respectively. 
Figure 1 presents the X-ray diffraction patterns of the 
Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 and (Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 alloys. Both 
Zr- based amorphous alloys are x-ray amorphous. 
Electrochemical measurements were obtained using a 
typical three-electrode system. The electrode consisted of a 
stationary specimen, a pair of counter electrode and a 
saturated calomel electrode. A Solartron model 1286A 
potentiostat was used for the cyclic potentiodynamic 
polarization curve measurements. Calibration was 
conducted in accordance with ASTM G 5-78 [17] and 
ASTM G 59-78 [18]. 
 
Results and Discussion 
The Evans diagram for Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 and 
(Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 amorphous alloys and Zircaloy in 
3.5% NaCl, 0.1N H2SO4 and 0.1 N NaOH solutions are 
shown in Figures 2-4. The corrosion data from polarization 
curves are summarized in Tables 1-3. The corrosion current 
densities of (Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 were the lowest among 
the specimens in 3.5% NaCl, 0.1N H2SO4 solutions. A 
wider passivation region and lower passivation current 
densities were observed for (Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 than 
Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 in all test solutions. This indicates that the 
Er addition to Zr BMGs can be easier to passivate and 
more corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions. Rosalbino 
et al. reported [19] that adding Er to Mg alloys also found 
great corrosion improvement. 
Surface morphologies of both Zr based BMGs show pits 
formation after polarization tests in 3.5% NaCl solution 
and are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Zircaloy has highest 
value of pitting potential in 3.5% NaCl, three Zr alloys 
show susceptibility to pitting corrosion. 
 
Conclusions 
Adding 2% Er to Zr-baesd BMGs, exhibits the beneficial 
effect on corrosion resistance of Zr-based BMGs. 
(Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5)98Er2 even shows better corrosion

Abstract The oxidation behavior of the Zr58Cu22Al12Fe8 
bulk-metallic glasses (ZC4-BMG) was studied over the 
temperature range of 350 - 550°C in dry air.  The 
oxidation kinetics of the ZC4-BMG generally followed a 
multi-stage parabolic-rate law, and the steady-state 
parabolic-rate constants (kp values) increased with 
increasing the temperature when it is below the 
glass-transition temperature (Tg= 413.3oC).  Conversely, 
the kp values were nearly identical from 400 to 550oC. The 
scales formed on ZC4-BMG were composed mostly of 
tetragonal-ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) and minor amounts of Al2O3 and 
monoclinic-ZrO2 (m-ZrO2).  The amounts of both Al2O3 
and m-ZrO2 increased with increasing the temperature.  In 
addition, the amorphous substrate remained unchanged 
after the oxidation for 36 h at T < 375oC.  However, it 
transformed into different crystalline phases at higher 
temperatures, which are strongly dependent on the 
temperature and duration of time. 
 
1. Introduction 
Zr-based bulk-metallic glasses (BMGs) are the most 
popular amorphous systems among the BMG systems 
studied because of their easy fabrication and relative low 
material-cost for use in many practical applications [1-4].  
In general, these BMGs possess good glass-forming ability 
(GFA) against crystallization and superior mechanical 
properties [5-6].  Moreover, a series of new Zr-Cu-Al-Fe 
BMGs containing free Ni were developed to meet the 
possible applications for biomedical purposes.  It was 
found that the Zr58Cu22Fe8Al12 (in atomic percent, at.%) 
BMG (ZC4-BMG) is one of the best amorphous alloys in 
the composition of (ZrxCu100-x)80(Al60Fe40)20 with the x 
range of 68 ~ 77.  A typical example of ZC4-BMG had an 
excellent tensile yield strength of 1.71 GPa and an elastic 
strain of 2.25% [7].  Another interesting work was 
reported to study the cytotoxicity behavior of the same 
BMG with surface-modification treatments, and it was 
found that an exclusive ZrO2 formed on the surfaces of the 
as-cast glassy alloy acts as a protective barrier to provide 
good biocompatibility although the exact modification of 
zirconia was not identified [8].  In spite of some studies 
on the mechanical and biochemical properties of 
ZC4-BMG, its air-oxidation behavior has not yet been 
studied.  Thus, the main goal of this study is to investigate 
the oxidation behavior of ZC4-BMG, and, in particular, to 
understand the role of alloying elements on the scale 
constitution and phases.  In addition, the crystalline 
counterpart with the same composition was also 
investigated for comparative purposes. 
 
2. Experimental 
The ZC4-BMG rods were prepared by an 
injecting-casting technique, as described elsewhere [9].  
The actual composition of the amorphous rod done by 
X-ray wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) is 
Zr-21.7%Cu-12.5%Al-7.8%Fe (at.%).  Sample slices with 
a measured weight of about 35 mg were cut from the BMG 
ingot (3 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in height), 
mechanically polished down to #1,000 SiC abrasive papers, 
cleaned in acetone, and, then, immediately dried before the 
tests.  Some BMG samples were further vacuum-annealed 
at 700oC for 30 min. to obtain the crystalline counterparts 
(X-ZC4) for comparison studies. 
Details of the oxidation measurements by the 
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) at a heating rate of 
10°C/min. in high-purity dry air (> 99.999%) have been 
described elsewhere [10].   The net flow rate of air was 
kept constant at 40 cm3/min. throughout each test, and the 
heating and cooling rates of the TGA furnace were set at 
 30
also in good agreement with the fact that the 400oC- kp 
value of the amorphous alloy is much faster than that of 
X-ZC4 at the same temperature and exposure time (Fig. 4).  
In addition, it should be pointed out that two crystalline 
phases of Zr2Cu and Zr2Al were detected in the substrate, 
indicating the occurrence of the partial crystallization for 
ZC4-BMG although the oxidation temperature is about 
13oC below Tg (413.3oC).  Furthermore, the scales formed 
on the amorphous alloy at 450oC for 36 h is shown in Fig. 
7, revealing a thick scale-layer, having an average 
thickness of around 11.9 + 0.8 μm.  XRD analyses 
revealed a similar scaling behavior at T < 400oC except 
that the amounts of Al2O3 and m-ZrO2 were much 
abundant.  Unlike the unchanged amorphous structure at 
T < 375oC or the formation of two crystalline phases of 
Zr2Cu and Zr2Al at 400oC, another important aspect to the 
substrate is to form four crystalline phases after the 
450oC-oxidation, containing not only Zr2Cu and Zr2Al, but 
also two additional phases of ZrCu and Zr2Fe.  The 
amount of Zr2Fe is very small and nearly undetectable.  
Therefore, it is necessary to further verify the existence of 
this compound through TEM studies.  An example of 
TEM micrograph and corresponding SAD patterns taken 
from the cross section of the ZC4-BMG substrate after the 
450oC-oxidation for 36 h are shown in Fig. 8.  The 
bright-field image revealed numerous nano-granular 
crystalline phases with an average grain size around 10 to 
15 nm.  The SAD results with an aperture size of 20 μm 
taken from dark particles came out in spot patterns under 
the zone axis of [210] for the Zr2Fe phase.  Thus, TEM 
analyses confirmed the presence of Zr2Fe in the substrate 
after a 36-h exposure at 450oC.   
Cross-sectional BEI micrographs of ZC4-BMG 
oxidized at 500 - 550oC for 36 h are further shown in Figs. 
9a-b.  The scales formed at both temperatures were also 
well adherent to the substrate, and their thickness was 
nearly equal to that at 450oC, being about 14.6 + 2.8 μm at 
500oC and 15.2 + 1.4 μm at 550oC.  This observation is in 
good agreement with the similar kp values at both 
temperatures.  In addition, the average scale-thickness of 
ZC4-BMG formed at 500oC for 36 h is thicker than that of 
X-ZC4, which is also in good agreement with the faster 
oxidation kinetics of the glassy alloy, as presented in Table 
1.  The corresponding XRD spectra obtained at 550oC are 
shown in Fig. 9c, indicating that the scale constitution and 
substrate crystalline-phases are similar to those at 450oC, 
except that the amounts of Al2O3 and m-ZrO2 in the scales 
and of ZrCu and Zr2Fe in the substrate gradually increased 
with temperature.  As reported previously [10-11], this 
similar trend is commonly observed in the air oxidation of 
other Zr-based BMGs, although the composition and 
temperature range in this study were not exactly the same.  
Furthermore, in a review of the Zr-O system, ZrO2 is the 
only stable phase in the oxidation of pure Zr, and three 
modifications may exist, containing the monoclinic, 
tetragonal, and cubic structure being stable below 1,000 – 
1,200oC, at 1,200 – 1,500oC, and above 1,500oC, 
respectively [13].  Also, the exact transformation 
temperature may be markedly affected on the impurity 
content present in the BMG substrate [14].  It is very 
likely that the presence of both t- and m-ZrO2 but the 
absence of the cubic modification in the current study, as 
well as the change of their relative amounts were 
dependent on temperature.  The formation of various 
amounts of t- and m-ZrO2 or possible Al2O3 in the scales 
could play an important role in the observed similar kp 
values of ZC4-BMG at 400 - 550oC.   In order to clarify 
this possibility, the areas of the strongest XRD peak-height 
intensities taken from different 2θ angles of the three 
oxides formed on ZC4-BMG at 400 and 500oC were 
calculated, and the results are presented in Table 2.   The 
results of the similar calculations for X-ZC4 are also 
summarized in the same table for comparative purposes.  
Apparently, the higher the temperature is, the more the 
amounts of Al2O3 and m-ZrO2 present in the scales of the 
two alloys.  As well-known, one may expect that the 
higher the temperature is, the faster the diffusivities of 
cations and anions (O) through the scales, thereby leading 
a faster oxidation rate if the scale constitution and phases 
are independent of temperature.  However, if the growth 
rate of Al2O3 and m-ZrO2 is indeed lower than that of 
t-ZrO2, and, then, the growth of abundant amounts of 
t-ZrO2 for ZC4-BMG at the 400oC-oxidation may 
contribute a fast scaling rate, which could be identical to 
another contribution from the fast diffusivities raised at 
higher temperatures.  Thus, the kp values of ZC4-BMG 
were nearly the same from 400 to 550oC. 
An interesting aspect to further discuss is the possible 
reason why the amorphous alloy exhibited a poor oxidation 
resistance despite forming similar oxides (Al2O3, t- and 
m-ZrO2).  One possible reason could be attributed to the 
presence of the extra free volume in the amorphous alloy, 
which may provide an easy, short-circuit path for the 
inward diffusion of oxygen, thereby leading to faster 
oxidation rates, as described in the literature [15].  
Another reason could be due the formation of different 
amounts of oxides, as also shown in Table 2.  Since the 
amounts of Al2O3 and m-ZrO2 formed on X-ZC4 are much 
greater than those formed on ZC4-BMG at both 
temperatures, it is possible to expect that the X-ZC4 may 
have a better oxidation assistance.   
Besides, another interesting aspect of the results to 
discuss is the reason why the high-temperature t-ZrO2 
phase could retain its stability or only partially transform 
into the stable m-ZrO2 phase after a 36-h exposure over the 
temperature range of study.  Although this observation 
has commonly been reported in the previous studies 
[10-11], yet the answer is still unclear.   This may deserve 
the short-term oxidation study, as described below. 
 
Short-term oxidation 
As well known, a BMG may suffer the simultaneous 
oxidation and crystallization when exposed in air at 
temperatures near Tg.  To clarify the sequence of the 
oxidation and crystallization of ZC4-BMG as well as to 
examine the stability of oxides, short-term-oxidation tests

一、參加經過 
 
The 5th International Conference on Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMG-V) is an extension 
conference after the BMG-I in Singapore, BMG-II in Taiwan, BMG-III in Europe, BMG-IV 
in USA. It is a special conference particularly for bulk metallic glasses. This one in Japan has 
attracted 182 presentations and 200 participants from this scientific community. Among the 
submitted papers, 57 of them are selected as oral presentation and 125 for poster presentation. 
One of our submitted papers is selected as oral presentation, and the rest are in posters.  
 
The oral presentations are separated into fourteen sessions, each with one emphasis. It 
starts from the keynote speech by the pioneer in this field, Prof. A. Inoue, from Tohoku 
university of Japan. He addressed the fabrication and applications of late transition metal base 
bulk glassy alloys with critical diameters of centimeter order (from 10 mm to 100 mm). He 
not only presented the processing and applications for bulk structural uses, but also gave 
many examples for the mini-parts used in MEMS, which is highly useful for Taiwan industry.

highly stimulating to us.  
 
  
Taken for the improved ductility and toughness by the addition of high melting elements (left) 
or using surface compressive residual stresses (right) 
 
Taiwan attendants this time are totally 22 from NSYSU (9), ISU (5), NTOU (4), NCKU 
(2), and NTHU (2). It is about 1/10 of the participants. The papers submitted from Taiwan are 
21, around 1/6 of the total papers. The strength in quantity is very significant, but the quality 
still requires further improvement. There is only one oral presentation selected by the 
BMG-V committee, which is the paper by our group in NSYSU: 
“Thermomechanical behavior of Mg-Cu-Y bull metallic glasses”, by Y. C. Chang, T. H. 
Hung, H. M. Chen, J. C. Huang, and Y. G. Nieh.  
 
  
Taken on the conference site with my students (left) and the oral presentation (right) 
 
The other ten papers submitted from our group are

 My trip to Vancouver, Canada, during June 28 till July 9 of 2006 includes the visit of 
University of British Columbia (UBC) and the participation of the Thermec Conference. Both 
visits are fruitful and the interaction with local people was great.  
 
The Thermec 2006 represents the 2006 International Conference on Processing & 
Manufacturing of Advanced Materials. It has been held in many major cities over the past 
twenty years, for example, Sydney in 1997, Las Vegas in 2000, Spain in 2003, and Vancouver 
in 2006. The conference usually attracts more than 1000 attendances worldwide. There are 
nine sessions, with 23 focuses, including aluminum alloy, titanium alloys, magnesium alloys, 
steels, intermetallics, composites, biomaterials, superalloys, metallic glasses, hydrogen and 
fell cell materials, economic materials, smart materials, surface engineering, thin films, 
fracture and mechanical properties, powder metallurgy, metallic foams, severe plastic 
deformation, texture, nanocrystalline materials, welding and joining, modeling, and 
microstructural characterization. The session I attend is the metallic glasses, and the invited 
paper I presented is “Thermomechanical properties of Mg-Cu(Ni)-Y(Gd) amorphous and 
nanocrystalline alloys. My presentation was scheduled on the first day morning and the first 
session of this focus, and the content attracted much attention and arose many questions. I felt 
the interaction and discussion of this talk were very positive.

the first in world-wide literature. The results are also very promising. There are many 
scholars and students visiting our poster and discussed with me and my PhD student, C. I. 
Chang. Prof. K. Higashi from Osaka of Japan also stopped by our poster and discussed the 
future of friction stir processing. He will also come to Taiwan to visit us, ITRI, and Mg 
association next month.

After the welcome party on Oct 22, the keynote speeches were scheduled on Oct 23 
morning. The four keynote presentations are all attractive and interesting. These are  
(1) “Modeling of Metal Processing and Nanostructure Evolution”, by the Chinese 
Academician YiYi Li, Institute of Metal Research (IMR), Chinese Academic of Science 
(CAS), China. 
(2) “A Look at Physical Simulation of Metallurgical Processing, Past, Present, and Future”, 
presented by Dr. D. Ferguson, Dynamic System, Inc, USA. 
(3) “Nano Material Properties for Process Simulation”, presented by Prof. N. Saunders, 
Thermotech Ltd, UK.  
(4) “Ultrafine Grain Formation in FCC Metals during Severe Plastic Deformation”. 
presented by Prof. T. Sakai, University of Electro-Communications, Japan. 
 
I was invited by the conference chairman, Prof. J. Niu, Harbin Institute of Technology, 
and submitted two papers. One was selected to present in oral session, and the other is 
presented in poster. I took two graduate students to this conference to open their eyes, and 
meet some worldwide famous scholars. This would strengthen their vision and courage. I feel 
that they two have learned a lot through this trip, owing to the sponsorship of Nano Center, 
NSYSU, by the budget of 50B project of MOE. The two papers of ours are  
(1) “Finite Element Simulation of Micro-Imprinting in Mg-Cu-Y Amorphous Alloys”, by Y. 
C. Chang, T. T. Wu, M. F. Chen, C. J. Lee, J. C. Huang, and C. T. Pan.  
(2) “Atomic Simulation of Vitrification Transformation in Mg-Cu Thin Film”, by Y. C. Lo, 
J. C. Huang, C. L. Chen, S. P. Ju, H. S. Chou, X. H. Du, M. C. Liu, and C. N. Kuo.  
After the keynote speech, there are eight parallel session going on, which are  
(1) Casting, 65 papers 
(2) Forming (1)  
(3) Forming (2), the two Forming sessions have 201 papers 
(4) Materials (1)  
(5) Materials (2), the two Materials sessions have 216 papers 
(6) Welding, 121 papers 
(7) Nano Processing and simulation, 22 papers 
(8) Others, 135 papers 
Our 1st paper is in the Forming (1) session, and the 2nd one is in the Materials (1) session. 
Both sessions attracted great attendance.  
Over the conference, I have listened many interesting and stimulating talk. For 
example, Prof. Sakai used the multi-directional forging (MDF) to result in nano strained 
materials, which appears to be easier than the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) I have used. 
The forming can apply via three directions, making the recrystallized grains to be equiaxed 
and in nano scales. Following his idea, using multiple passes of MDF, the binary or ternary 
alloy might have chance to achieve grain size down to 10 nm or eventually to amorphous 
alloys. 
The misorientation angles between the resulting grains are mostly over 20o, meaning 
that the boundaries are mostly high angle grain boundaries. And the forging can be done at 
lower temperatures, for example, at 195 K or even lower, which is difficult to achieve when 
applying ARB. There might some room for our future studies.  
 When doing simulation, a talk by a British professor is helpful. He mentioned that we 
need the information from four aspects.  
(1) Knowledge base system, 
(2) Regressive analyses,  
(3) Fundamental theoretical modeling (e.g., first principle calculation, MD simulation, etc),  
(4) Thermodynamics consideration.
