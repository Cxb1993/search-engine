In this project, we investigate the all-optical regeneration techniques. A semiconductor laser, a 
commonly available low-cost light source, is recently found to be an ideal optical decision 
element, which can provide all-optical 2R regenerating function when injection-locked by a 
degraded signal. Both theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration are studied. Based on 
the traditional two-mode injection locking (TMIL) technique, two types of 
semiconductor-laser-based 2R schemes are presented. The first scheme has a simplified structure 
which employs a compact self-seed Fabry-Pérot laser diode (SSFP-LD) to execute all-optical 2R 
regeneration without the help from the traditionally required external probe lasers. Additionally, 
an integrated module using this SSFP-LD incorporated in a bidirectional optical amplifier is also 
proposed. Another scheme is an amplifier-free edition of the first one. By skillfully using 
different operation conditions from those of the first scheme, even the outside amplifiers are not 
required for 1.3/1.5 μm all-optical 2R regeneration. The proposed schemes are proved to be 
cost-effective solutions for the system impairments, and are promising for future deployment of 
optical networks.

achieve a nonlinear intensity transfer function. Figure 1.2 shows the most common structure: 
SOA-based Mach–Zehnder interferometer (SOA-MZI). An input signal at wavelength λ1 acting 
as a control signal and a continuous-wave (CW) signal at wavelength λ2 acting as a probe. The 
output power is given by  
 
 
Where 
1,2, -)()(Δ 11 ΦPΦPΦ λinλin =  . The injection signal at λ1 will induce a phase shift through cross 
phase modulation (XPM), and the amount of which depends upon its power level 
1,λinP . As a 
result, phase modulation is attempted to change the amplitude on the signal at λ2, and 2R 
regeneration can be achieved. 
 
1.2.2  Fiber-Based 
In the case of fiber-based devices such as the nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) illustrated in 
Fig. 1.3, the phase shift is induced through Kerr effect in an optical fiber [8]. Such cross-phase 
modulation (XPM) induced optical phase change will determinate whether the input signal is 
transmitted or reflected. The fiber-based devices have fast response of the Kerr nonlinearity, 
which is suitable for ultrahigh bit-rate operation. However, major limitations lay in environmental 
instability, strong polarization dependence, and difficult integration, resulting from the 
requirement of kilometer-scale fiber lengths. 
 
1.2.3  EAM-Based 
Another choice is using an electro-absorber modulator (EAM) as a saturable absorber to achieve 
ER improvement and reduce noise variation [9]. Such device absorbs low intensity noise, for 
example amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), while high intensity pulses are transmitted with 
low loss. The optical nonlinearities induced in an EAM is based on real process of carrier 
generation by absorption of injected optical pulse, and the absorption recovery time is faster than 
gain recovery time of an SOA.  
 
1.2.4  Semiconductor-Laser-Based 
In addition to semiconductor optical amplifier, semiconductor laser have also been applied as 
all-optical 2R regenerator [10]. Such 2R regeneration features an injection locking phenomenon 
which can only be observed within an oscillator above certain threshold condition. Laser injection 
locking exhibits an on-off threshold for the incoming signal. Therefore, a step-like nonlinear 
intensity transfer function can be provided. Besides, compared with SOA, the semiconductor 
diode laser has far reduced cost and compatible regeneration efficiency, and thus become the 
main subject of our study.

is defined by the ratio of the transmitted field over the injected one, can be written in the form:

magnitude )(ωrtG inside the laser cavity rises to be exactly unity at free-running oscillation 
frequency, an oscillation threshold would occur. Such oscillation threshold would thus correspond 
to the point where the overall regenerative gain goes to infinity for an externally injected signal 
tuned exactly to the oscillation frequency of the laser. Therefore, a laser injection locking is 
achieved. 
 Actually, the )(ωrtG would be clamped at the value of unity, which means that the overall 
regenerative gain for an externally applied signal at any other frequency away from the resonance 
frequency is still finite and limited as illustrated in Fig. 3.2. The regenerative power gain has the

on either side of the free-running frequency ω0, the amplified signal begin to steal enough gain 
from the laser medium, or begin to saturate the laser gain down, that the free-running laser 
oscillation at ω0 will be turned off or goes out, leaving only the injected signal at ω1. However, 
the amplified output power at the injected frequency ω1 will no longer continue to rise as ω1 is 
tuned further inside this range, since the amplifying medium αm inside the oscillator just can not 
supply enough power. Instead, the amplified output at ω1 will be limited to the free-running 
oscillation intensity I0, or slightly above this to account for the additional signal power that is

It is reasonable that a stable injection locking will be achieved if the system, with slight 
perturbations of δI, δN, and δ , returns to its equilibrium state through a damped relaxation 
oscillation. Therefore, following the standard treatment as in [6], the Fourier transformation and 
Routh-Herqitz criterion were applied to above equation to obtain the damping time of the 
relaxation oscillation in the following form:

As a result, the dynamic limit of injection locking range is defined by the curve τR = 0 illustrated 
in Fig 2.3. Four different regimes are thus distinguished as a function of injection power ratio: (A) 
a symmetrical stable locking band; (B) two stable locking bands for positive and negative values 
of frequency detuning separated by an unstable region; (C) stable locking only for negative 
values of detuning; and (D) a bistable region [22-24]. 
 
2.2.3 Relaxation Oscillation Frequency 
It is known that the modulation bandwidth of a semiconductor laser is proportional to its 
relaxation oscillation frequency given by the following form [25]: 
 
 
 
where τp is the average photon life time in the laser cavity, υ is the group velocity of light, and S0 
is the photon density in steady state which is proportional to |β(t)|2. In fact, the second term in 
(2.13) is relatively small and negligible. Apparently, in order to enhance the relaxation oscillation 
frequency, we have two choices: reducing the photon life time τp, and increasing the photon 
density S0. Reducing the photon life time can be achieved by reducing the length of laser active 
medium and lowering the reflectivity of the end facet. And from above analysis, we know that the 
injection locking is a useful technique to increase the photon density S0 in the laser cavity by 
stimulated emission, and the relaxation oscillation frequency can thus be effectively enhanced. In 
addition, the damping time will also be highly reduced as the injection level increase. Therefore,

over the zeros and ones. The schematic diagram of the proposed self-seeded FP-LD is illustrated 
in Fig. 3.2. To achieve higher modulation bandwidth and lower polarization effect, a short FBG 
cavity length is needed. A 2.5 GHz commercial high-power FP-LD without an output isolator is 
employed. A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is directly integrated into a FP-LD with a ~10mm-long 
feedback cavity. 
 
3.2.2 Static Characteristics 
Figure 3.3 shows the output power of the self-seeded tone varies with the signal injection power 
at different bias currents. As shown in Fig 3.3, step-like transfer functions can be observed. The 
peak power of self-seeded tone increase with the bias current, and require more signal injection 
power to compete with it. In addition, Figure 3.4 displays the output power of the self-seeded 
tone varies with the signal injection power at different injection mode numbers. As indicated in 
Fig 3.4, with larger injection mode number +8, the injection locking threshold power is higher 
and the injection signal requires more peak power to suppress the self-seeded tone. 
 
3.2.3 Experimental Setup 
Figure 3.5 displays the experimental setup for this proposed all-optical 2R regeneration at 10 
Gb/s (with block A). A self-seeded FP-LD for all-optical waveform reshaping was placed 
between two 50 km standard single-mode fiber (Corning SMF-28) spans. A 1548.39 nm 
transmission signal, generated from a tunable laser (TL), was externally modulated by an 
electro-optic modulator (EOM) with a 231-1 PRBS data stream at 10 Gb/s. The modulated signal 
was propagated through the first 50 km fiber span, and was then injected into the self-seeded 
FP-LD via an optical circulator (OC) and a polarization controller (PC). The self-seeded FP-LD 
was biased at 3.14 times the threshold current and the temperature was controlled at 19.76℃ to 
generate a self-seeded tone at 1546.26 nm with a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) larger than 
30 dB. Moreover, an FBG with a central wavelength of 1546.1 nm, a grating reflection of 9 dB, 
and a bandwidth of 0.2 nm, was packaged inside the FP-LD. After filtered out by a bandpass filter 
(BPF) with a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.8 nm, the regenerated signal was propagated through another 
50 km fiber span and transmitted to a clock and data receiver (CDR) to generate electrical clock 
and data for performance evaluation in a bit-error-ratio tester (BERT). A variable optical 
attenuator (VOA1) was used to adjust the input signal power at FP-LD, and VOA2 was employed 
to set the average powers at each input port of 50km spans to 1 dBm to prevent fiber nonlinearity. 
Moreover, the functional block B represents the all-optical waveform regenerator for the 
two-mode injection locked method [6-7]. In this case, a 1547.08 nm external probe laser with 0 
dBm power and a 1549.28 nm transmission signal with -1.7 dBm average power were injected 
into the FP-LD via a 70:30 coupler, an OC and PCs for all-optical reshaping. 
 
3.2.4 Result and Discussion 
Figures 3.6(a) and (b) show the optical spectra of the self-seeded FP-LD without and with the 
injection signal at 10 Gb/s, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3.6(b), a 1548.39 nm injection signal 
results in gain competition with the self-seeded tone at 1546.24 nm, and induces two four wave 
mixing (FWM) tones. Such FWM tones can be negligible since they’ll be filtered out by the 
optical band-pass filter. The insert is the optical reflection and transmission spectra of the FBG. 
Figure 3.7 illustrates the received eye diagrams at 10 Gb/s with and without 2R regeneration. The 
average injection power into the FP-LD was kept at 1.3 dBm, and the distorted signal was 
injected at a frequency in one of the FP modes with a slight detuning of +0.05 nm from the 
central frequency in this mode. As a result, with regeneration, the eye diagram was still 
wide-open after 100 km propagation, while the signal without regeneration was seriously 
distorted by the accumulation of chromatic dispersion. Figure 3.8 shows the bit error rate (BER) 
performance of the proposed (P) scheme and that of the two-mode injection locked (T) method. 
The BER performance without using optical regenerators is also indicated in Figure 3.8. For fair 
comparison, the same FP-LD without an embedded FBG was employed as the slave laser and 
was driven under the same condition. When the proposed method was used, the power penalties, 
14 
 
transmitted over the first fiber span of 50 km, and then was injected into block A or B through a 
polarization controller (PC). The transmission performance at 50 km can be measured right after 
the point b. To measure the performance of 100 km transmission, the regenerated signal, after 
filtered out by an OBPF with the 3 dB bandwidth of 0.8 nm, was propagated through another 50 
km fiber span and into a receiving module. This module includes a variable optical attenuator 
(VOA), an optical preamplifier, an OBPF, and an optical-to-electrical (O/E) module. A 20 Gb/s 
digital scope for eye diagram measurement or a bit-error-ratio tester (BERT) with a clock and 
data receiver (CDR) for bit-error-ratio (BER) measurement is utilized after this receiving module. 
To prevent from causing fiber nonlinearity, the average powers at each input port of 50 km spans 
were set at –8 dBm. 
 
3.3.3 Result and Discussion 
Fig. 3.11 shows the output spectra of the proposed 2R regenerator when the testing signal is 
injected. As shown in Fig. 3.11, the injected signal of 1555.32 nm is located in the fourth 
longitudinal mode counting from the self-seeded tone in the long wavelength direction. In order 
to optimize the regenerated signal, the average injection power into the proposed 2R regenerator 
is kept at –18.2 dBm with a slight wavelength detuning of +0.03 nm from the central frequency 
of targeted mode. The input power dynamic range of the proposed 2R regenerator ranges 
between –16.2 and –21.8 dBm, and the total signal gain provided by this proposed 2R module is 
about 10.2 dB. Moreover, two four wave mixing (FWM) tones generated by the injected signal 
and the self-seeded tone are observed in Fig. 3.11. The inset in Fig. 3.11 indicates the optical 
spectra of the embedded FBG for reflection and transmission. Figure 3.12 shows that the 
measured input and output optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) of the proposed 2R regenerator 
are 22.64 and 35.41 dB/0.1nm, respectively. The minimum required OSNR is about 21 dB/0.1nm. 
ASE noise accumulated in mark and space of the incoming signal could be obviously suppressed 
due to the thresholding characteristic of the proposed 2R device. Figure 3.13 performs a 
back-to-back testing that puts signal from transmitter directly into the 2R regenerator and 
measure the BER penalty in this situation. The input and output eye patterns are measured. The 
power penalty at 10-9 BER in that situation is about 0.5 dB, which is the regenerating limitation 
for the proposed 2R module. Fig. 3.14 illustrates the received eye diagrams at 10 Gb/s using 
proposed 2R and traditional 1R regenerations for 50 and 100 km fiber link transmissions. As 
shown in Fig. 3.14, the proposed 2R regeneration can provide a wide-opened eye after 100 km 
propagation, while the signal using 1R-only regeneration was seriously distorted by the 
accumulated chromatic dispersion over 100 km transmission. In addition, Figure 4.15 shows the 
BER performances of the proposed 2R regenerator and the conventional 1R module for 50 and 
100 km fiber transmissions. For the proposed 2R regenerator, the power penalties of BER = 10-9, 
referring to the back-to-back case, are 1.9 and 2.5 dB after 50 and 100 km transmissions, 
respectively. However, larger power penalties of 3 and 8.9 dB are observed for 1R-only 
regeneration after transmitting over 50 km and 100 km. Therefore, compared with conventional 
1R regeneration, this proposed 2R regeneration can obtain 6.4 dB improvement of power penalty 
at BER = 10-9 for 100 km SSMF propagation. 
 
3.4 Summary 
In this chapter, we present and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of 10 Gb/s all-optical 
2R regeneration via the injection locking of a compact self-seeded FP-LD with an ultrashort 
feedback cavity of ~10 mm. In our experiments, it is proven that, by using the proposed 
self-seeded method, the BER performances can compete with those of the traditional two-mode 
injection locked scheme. Also, we further propose a new and economic 10 Gb/s all-optical 2R 
regenerator consisting of a compact SSFP-LD with an ultrashort feedback cavity of ~10 mm, and 
a bidirectional EDFA. The BER performances of using the proposed scheme, compared with the 
one of 1R-only regeneration, can be significantly improved. The elimination of external probe 
laser and utilization of a bidirectional EDFA can highly simplify the all-optical 2R regeneration. 
Both simplified TMIL schemes are promising on the applications of future optical networks.

SSFP-LD, the FP-LD is injection-locked and begins to operate at λ1 with a constant power. The 
induced red-shift of the FP mode comb would lead to a wavelength misalignment between the 
reflectivity maximum of the FBG and the closest FP longitudinal mode, and helps to quench the 
self-seeded tone [22]. The injection-locking mechanism is characterized by an on-off threshold 
that can be exploited to reduce and compress the noise over the zeros and ones. In addition, the 
regeneratively amplified gain of injected signal Sin is limited by the spectral profile of the FP-LD. 
A positive gain of input signal can be achieved by arranging the signal wavelength in the 
main-peak mode area and the self-seeded tone far from the main-peak mode. 
 
4.2.2 Experimental Setup 
Figure 4.2 indicates experimental setups for 10 Gb/s all-optical transmissions with the proposed 
2R regenerator (block A) and a conventional EDFA module (1R device, block B). To provide an 
EDFA-free transmission, a self-seeded FP-LD, which can provide 8.3 dB gain at 1560.12 nm, 
was placed between two 38 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) spans. A signal at 1560.12 nm, 
generated from a tunable laser (TL), was externally modulated by an electro-optic modulator 
(EOM) with 231−1 PRBS data stream at 10 Gb/s. The modulated signal propagated through the 
first 38 km fiber span, and then was injected into the SSFP-LD via an optical circulator (OC) and 
a polarization controller (PC). The SSFP-LD was biased at 4.6 times its threshold current (10 mA) 
and had its temperature controlled at 17.35℃ to generate a self-seeded tone at 1551 nm with a 
side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) larger than 40 dB. After filtered out by a bandpass filter 
(BPF) with a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.8 nm, the regenerated signal was propagated through another 
38 km fiber span, and transmitted to an optical receiver to investigate the bit error rate (BER) 
performance and the eye diagram. Average input powers of around −8 dBm were set at two 38 
km spans to avoid or decrease the nonlinear effects such as self phase modulation (SPM) of fiber 
and four wave mixing (FWM) of SSFP-LD. 
 
4.2.3 Result and Discussion 
Figure 4.3(a) and (b) illustrate the optical spectra of the SSFP-LD without, and with the injection 
signal, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4.3(a), the free-running SSFP-LD have a 1551 nm self-seed 
tone with side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) over 40 dB. In Fig. 4.3(b), when a 1560.12 nm 
degraded signal at 10 Gb/s was injected, the beating between the injection signal and the 
self-seeded tone led to two FWM tones at 1541.94 and 1569.42 nm, respectively. However, such 
redundant components can be eliminated by an OBPF before being transmitted to the next span. 
Figure 4.4 shows the testing results of data-rate transparency up to 10 GHz. The noisy signals at 
bit rates of 155 MHz, 2.5 GHz and 10 GHz were input into the proposed 2R regenerator, and the 
outputs with clear eye diagrams come out. The data-rate transparency of the proposed scheme has 
been successfully proven.  
Figure 4.5 depicts the dynamic range and amplified gain of the injection signal for the proposed 
SSFP-LD as a function of the operating wavelengths to achieve successful waveform reshaping. 
Clearly, a higher signal gain and lower injection power level can be obtained if the operating 
wavelength approaches the free-running main mode of the FP-LD (~1562 nm). Figure 4.6 depicts 
26 
 
techniques have been presented, such as praseodymium doped-fiber amplifier (PDFA) [23-25], 
Raman amplifier (RA) [26-28], and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) [29-31], to provide a 
supplementary transmission window for the present EDFA-dominant system. However, owing to 
the issues of device cost and stability, it is still doubtful that whether these methods will meet the 
requirement for field deployment in local/metropolitan area networks (LANs/MANs). Recently, 
1.5 μm all-optical 2R regeneration (re-amplification and re-shaping) modules based on two-mode 
injection-locked (TMIL) semiconductor laser diodes [19-21] have been intensively studied. This 
type of regenerator usually requires extra optical amplifiers to re-amplify the signal and to 
compensate the loss of re-shaping. However, we find that optical amplifiers are not necessities 
since the TMIL semiconductor laser itself, in principle, can simultaneously act as a regenerative 
laser amplifier and a waveform re-shaper. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and demonstrate 
the feasibility of a new and cost-effective 1.3 μm all-optical 2R regenerator using a two-mode 
injection-locked distributed feedback laser diode (TMIL DFB-LD). This new regenerator can 
offer a promising alternative for short and middle haul applications. 
 
4.3.1 Operation Principle 
Figure 4.10 depicts the conceptual diagram of the proposed 1.3 μm all-optical 2R regenerator. A 
DFB-LD, which is side-mode injection-locked (SMIL) by a CW signal at λp, can provide 
all-optical 2R regeneration by highly suppressing its free-running main mode and enhancing its 
relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF). When a degraded signal Sin at wavelength λs, which has 
a power level exceeding the injection-locking threshold, is injected into this DFB-LD and its 
wavelength is fit into the locking range of the main mode, the Sin will be regeneratively 
amplified after passing through this DFB-LD. In the mean time, the mode frequencies of the 
DFB-LD will be red-shifted due to the carrier-induced refractive index change, which can help to 
pull the CW light out of the locking range and relieve the suppressing strength. If the Sin has the 
power level fallen below the injection-locking criterion, it will experience nature loss when going 
through this DFB-LD. As a result, the DFB-LD by using a two-mode injection-locked (TMIL) 
technique can reduce the accumulated noise over one and zero levels and achieve the signal 
regeneration. 
 
4.3.2 Experimental Setup 
Figure 4.11 illustrates the experimental setup for a 10 Gb/s straight line link with the proposed 
1.3 μm all-optical 2R regenerator. As shown in Fig. 4.11, the proposed 2R regenerator was placed 
between two 30 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) spans. An optical transmitter, composed 
of a tunable laser (TL), a PC and a Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM), can emit a 10 Gb/s signal 
with 231−1 PRBS test pattern at 1307.9 nm. After being transmitted over a 30 km SSMF span, 
the degraded signal was then fed into the proposed regenerator. This regenerator comprises an 
optical circulator (OC), a 60:40 coupler, a polarization controller (PC), and two DBF-LDs: 
DFB-LDp, and DFB-LDr. The DFB-LDr was biased at 23.6 mA and had its temperature 
controlled at 13.64℃ to generate a main mode wavelength at 1307.9 nm. In addition, the 
DFB-LDp, serving as an external probe light source, was biased at 141 mA and 10.42℃ to

technique, two types of semiconductor-laser-based 2R schemes are 
presented. The first scheme has a simplified structure which employs a 
compact self-seed Fabry-Pérot laser diode (SSFP-LD) to execute 
all-optical 2R regeneration without the help from the traditionally

By skillfully using different operation conditions from those of the first

Abstract: We propose a hybrid optical access network integrating wired-line FTTH baseband and 
wireless RF signals sharing a single distributed infrastructure. After transmitted over 50km optical 
fiber, power penalties for both signals are less than 0.2dB.

Introduction 
The high data rate demands of wireless and wired networks have been rapidly increasing in recent years. Since the 
costs of such separated wireless and wired access networks are high, there’s high desire to merge the two distributed 
networks into a single shared infrastructure. However, one of the tasks is to modulate and transmit both radio and 
baseband (BB) signals on a single wavelength over a single fiber. Recently, simultaneous modulation and 
transmission of a RF signal and a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) BB signal using one external modulator has been 
demonstrated [1-2]. Nevertheless, [1] and [2] suffer performance fading due to fiber dispersion so that the signals 
are transmitted over dispersion-shifted-fiber to reduce the impairment of fiber dispersion, resulting in increasing the 
cost of the distributed infrastructure. Furthermore, interchannel interference between the BB and RF signals in this 
system will degrade system performance [3]. Hence, a simple and cost-effective system without RF signal fading 
and interchannel interference is imperatively required. 
In this paper, we propose simultaneous!modulation and transmission of a 1.25-Gb/s on-off-keying (OOK) BB 
signal and a 20-GHz 622-Mbit/s OOK RF signal. We use double-sideband with optical carrier suppression (DSBCS) 
modulation scheme for the RF signals. Compared with double-sideband (DSB) and single-sideband (SSB) 
modulation schemes, RF signals using DSBCS modulation can provide the best receiver sensitivity, lowest spectral 
occupancy, lowest bandwidth requirement for RF devices and optical modulator, and smallest power penalty of 
receiver sensitivity after long transmitted distance. In addition, the BB signal can be modulated at the optical carrier. 
Moreover, in our proposed system, the power penalties of both BB and RF signals are below 0.2 dB after 
transmitted over 50 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF), demonstrating the feasibility of the system.
