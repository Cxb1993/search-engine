classes of compensation techniques, i.e., non-model-based 
and model-based compensation for friction.  The non-model-
based compensation techniques include stiff PD control, 
integral control, EKBF, and learning feed-forward 
compensation, etc.  Basically, the stiff PD control is 
implemented in a high proportional loop gain with 
differential controller to tune the damping value.  Some 
researchers modified the simple PD controller by adding 
another compensators, such as integral controller and 
nonlinear friction compensators, to improve system 
performance under friction.  Ray et al. presented and 
validated an extended Kalman-Bucy filter (EKBF)-based 
friction compensation method.   This friction estimator was 
constructed using EKBF by treating friction torque as an 
unknown state element and estimating the augmented state.  
Otten et al. studied a direct drive linear motor and found that 
force ripple and friction were the major disturbances to the 
system.  They proposed a learning feed-forward controller 
structure to eliminate the positional inaccuracy due to force 
ripple, friction, and any other disturbances. 
As motioned above, several friction models have been widely 
studied for providing a good understanding of friction.  Based 
on different models, the model-based compensation strategies 
can be employed.  Friedland and Park presented an adaptive 
compensation algorithm for a presumed constant Coulomb 
friction model.  In their approach, a nonlinear reduced-order 
observer was introduced, which forced the error between the 
estimated and actual parameter vector to converge 
asymptotically to zero.  Amin et al. and Tafazoli et al. used 
this nonlinear observer to estimate dynamic friction.  They 
modified the original nonlinear observer by appending a 
velocity observer.   Ro et al. designed a robust tracking 
control with a friction estimate and a direct disturbance 
observer (DOB).  Many researchers integrated the adaptive 
control with robust control methods to obtain good tracking 
performance as well as stability.  The approximation of 
friction can be obtained by multilayer neural networks (MNN) 
or radial basis function networks (RBFN).  Du and Nair 
adopted the RBFN for friction estimation because it was 
inherently well suited allowing for systematic designs with 
guaranteed error bounds.  Horng et al. proposed a LuGre 
model-based neural network friction compensation algorithm 
for a linear motor stage.  For matching the friction 
phenomena in both the motion-start region and the motion-
reverse region, the  LuGre dynamic model is employed into 
the proposed compensation algorithm. 
The LuGre model can capture most of the known frictional 
behaviors, and is suitable for control.  In this project, a 
feedforward friction compensator based on LuGre friction 
model is proposed.  The key parameters in this model are 
firstly estimated by various experiment of parameter 
identification and then GA optimizes the key parameters by a 
single identification experiment.  When compared with the 
conventional black box learning algorithm, this mode-based 
compensator uses only five parameters to model the 
nonlinear friction phenomenon and the corresponding 
convergent rate of parameters is fast in the learning process.  
Finally, the friction compensated performance of proposed 
algorithm is evaluated and compared with the traditional 
uncompensated system. The simulated and experimented 
results show that the velocity error is drastically improved by 
the feedforward friction compensator in a linear motor 
motion system. 
2. DYNAMICS OF LINEAR MOTOR STAGE 
The linear slide systems are the most common applications of 
motion control.  From the friction study viewpoint, the 
existing backlash and compliance in a ball-screw-driven 
system may induce nonlinear phenomena together with 
multi-source friction effects.  This makes it practically 
impossible to distinguish friction from other nonlinear effects.  
On the contrary, linear-motor-driven systems are free from 
the complicated situation because nonlinear backlash and 
multi-source frictions do not exist in the systems.  The 
observed friction behaviors will be quite different for the 
same reason.  In this project, a linear-motor-driven motion 
system is under study. 
2.1  Hardware Setup 
The experimental motion system setup illustrated in Fig. 1, 
consists of following components: a linear-motor-driven 
motion system and a PC with a DAC and encoder interface.  
The linear motor system is composed of a linear motor 
(PLSA-A-2-NC) and a servo amplifier (SERVOSTAR CD) 
operating in torque (current) mode, both of which are made 
by Kollmorgen Corporation.  Some specifications are listed 
in Table 1.  The linear motor is assembled with two linear 
guide-ways and other mechanical components to form the 
single-axis motion stage.  A linear scale (RENISHAW 
RGH22Y, resolution 0.4 micrometer) provides position 
information for the vector control of servo amplifier.

3.2 Feedforward Friction Compensator learning by GA 
Genetic algorithms are directed random search techniques 
which can find the global optimal solution in complex 
multidimensional search spaces.  GA were firstly proposed 
by Holland and have been applied successfully in many 
engineering and optimization problems.  Friction parameters 
appear nonlinearly in the LuGre model, which make them 
difficult to estimate.  Using GA, the friction parameters can 
be estimated by a single identification experiment.  In this 
project, the five parameters (Stribect velocity, coulomb and 
maximum stick force, bristle stiffness and damping 
coefficients) of LuGre model, coarsely obtained in section 
2.4, are optimized by GA.  The learning scheme is 
represented in Fig. 3; where the well tuned parameters of 
LuGre model are obtained by minimizing the error between 
velocity response vr from nominal velocity loop and the 
actual velocity response v.

of the parameters are specified according to the identified

5. CONCLUSIONS 
From the friction study viewpoint, the existing backlash and 
compliance in a ball-screw-driven system may induce 
nonlinear phenomena together with multi-source friction 
effects.  This makes it practically impossible to distinguish 
friction from other nonlinear effects.  In this project, a linear-
motor-driven motion system is under study because it is free 
from the complicated situation due to its simple structure and 
absence of flexible coupling. 
This project proposes a feedforward friction compensator 
based on LuGre friction model.  The various parameters in 
both the friction model and the system plant model would be 
coarsely estimated by the various experiments, and then the 
GA optimize the key parameters by a single identification 
experiment.  The friction can be estimated so as to 
compensate the friction in a linear motor stage.  When 
compared with the conventional black box learning algorithm, 
this model-based compensator uses only five parameters to 
model the nonlinear friction phenomenon and the 
corresponding convergent rate of parameters is fast in the 
learning process.  Finally, the proposed compensator is 
evaluated and compared experimentally with a traditional 
uncompensated system on a microcomputer controlled linear 
motor positioning system.  The experimental results show 
that the velocity error occurs at the motion-start region and 
the motion-reverse region are drastically improved.
