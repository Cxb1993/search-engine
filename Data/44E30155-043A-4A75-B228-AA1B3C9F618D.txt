Abstract 
In recent years, many incidents of intentional manipulation of fraudulent financial 
report have caused the financial loss of investors. A common failure in these incidents 
was that the auditors were unable to uncover the falseness in the financial reports. 
Thus, it is important for investors, creditors, regulators, and auditors to have the 
ability of predicting the possibility of financial distress of a company to prevent this 
kind of incidents happening again. One difficulty in financial distress problem is the 
scarce of the number of financial-distressed firms in the market, and hence makes it 
Other statistical techniques such as probit and logit analysis were also popular 
approaches for financial distress prediction.  The probit analysis uses statistical 
inference procedures to derive a linear model from a set of input data based on the 
assumption that the error term has a cumulative normal distribution.  The model 
estimates the probability that each case falls in a particular class.  Logit analysis is 
very similar to the probit analysis, except that it assumes that the error term has a 
logistic distribution.  Thus, the logit regression model of the financial distress 
prediction problem is defined as:

where, 
p: the probability of financial distress 
xi: explanatory variables of the prediction model, i=1,..,m 
β0: regression intercept 
βi: coefficients of the explanatory variables, i=1,..,m. 
It has been reported that the logit regression approach is often preferred over 
discriminant analysis [19]. 
 In recent years, machine learning techniques including decision tree, case-based 
reasoning (CBR), artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithm (GA) became 
popular in the research area of financial distress prediction.  These techniques were 
effective in financial distress prediction when nominal variables dominate.  For 
example, Han et al. [10] showed that the accuracy of this type of learning techniques 
increased as the portion of nominal variables decreased in the classification model. 
The principle of CBR is to remember a similar problem that has been solved in 
the past and adapt the old solution to solve the new problem [23].  Jo and Han [13] 
integrated CBR, ANN, and MDA to predict bankruptcy.  They also compared the 
performances of the three respect techniques [14].  Decision tree learning is a 
method for approximating discrete-valued target function, in which the learned 
function is represented by a decision tree.  Tam and Kiang [24] has compared the 
performance of the ID3 [20] decision tree with the neural network. 
ANNs are another popular machine learning technique used in financial distress 
prediction [6, 12, 13, 14, 24, 22, 18].  An artificial neural network is a parallel 
system of highly interconnected processing units based on neurobiological models.  
ANNs are designed to mimic the human cognition function through parallel 
processing of signals.  The processing units of the ANN are called neurons that are 
arranged in a number of hierarchical layers. One of the most widely implemented 
neural network architecture is the multi-layered feed-forward structure with 
supervised-learning.  This structure consists of input and output layers as well as one 
Financial Distress Index Measured by Zmijewski’s Model (FDI) 
Rather than directly treating individual financial ratios as explanatory variables, the 
ratios are aggregated into an overall score by the use of the probit model of 
Zmijewski’s [16] as done in [2].  These financial ratios are measured to proxy the 
profitability, leverage, and liquidity of the firms.  The Zmijewski model calculates a 
surrogate for the probability of bankruptcy, z*, as: 
z* = -4.803 – 3.6(ROA)+5.4(FNL)-0.1(LIQ)    
 (6) 
where, ROA = Net income / Total assets 
   FNL = Total debt / Assets 
   LIQ = Current assets / Current liabilities 
A higher value of z* indicates greater probability of bankruptcy. 
Ratio of Business Groups’ Cross-holding Investments (RCI) 
The research report published by Taiwan Economic Research Center in 1999 indicates 
that the cross-holding phenomenon is widespread in business groups in Taiwan among 
listed firms inducing monitoring inefficiency of the board, which in turn, helps trigger 
financial distress.  For this reason, we use the ratio of conglomerate companies’ 
cross-holding investments to reflect the unique institutional situation in Taiwan.   
Firm Size (SIZE) 
Becker et al. [5] suggested that firm size was a surrogate variable for numerous 
omitted variables in financial distress prediction and its inclusion increased the 
goodness of fit of the model.  Thus, we include the firm size in our prediction model.  
The firm size is calculated as the natural logarithm of equity by market value. 
Beta Coefficient (BETA) 
According to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the required return on equity 
capital for a firm is an increasing function of its systematic risk.  Conventional 
wisdom also suggested that the systematic risk of financial distressed firms should 
increase, presumably because of increases in leverage associated with financial 
distress [17].  Thus, it is reasonable to anticipate that the positive effect of leverage 
on systematic risk would seem to apply to financial distressed firms and the 
systematic risk of such firms is initially greater than average.  The present study 
incorporates such concept in the prediction model by dividing firms into aggressive 
stock for which with the β coefficient greater than 1 and neural/defensive stock for the 
β coefficient less than or equal to 1.  
3.1.2 Qualitative Variables (Nominal Variables) 
Auditor Changes (AC) 
Lennox [16] reported that companies switching auditor decrease the chance of receiving a 
modified audit report.  Firms with successful opinion shopping may replace an auditor in 
are subject to regulation and scrutiny by the Taiwanese Securities & Exchange 
Commission and Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation, and they are required to 
disclose financial data and release important operational information to the investors.  
In addition to the benefit of constructing a more or less homogeneous group of 
financial distress firms, such a practice also help collecting the necessary data.  
Secondly, important pieces of information of the listed corporations are rather widely 
reported and/or commented by mass media so that the financial distress 
announcement can be double-checked by relevant newspaper reporting.  The year 
1996 is chosen as the starting year of the data population due to data availability and 
manageability.  
One hundred and five companies are identified to incur financial distress during 
the sampling period, which is approximately 1.34% of the population.  Due to the 
scarcity of financial distress firms, a matched-pair design is used to compose the 
sample data.  We have conducted many sets of experiments to examine the effect of 
choice-based sampling.  In other words, each financial distress firm is matched with 
one, two, four, six, eight, and ten, respectively, healthy firms randomly selected from 
a group of firms which are in the same industry and with comparable firm size.  This 
matching process results in a sample of 210, 315, 525, 735, 945, and 1,155 firms, 
respectively, in which the data of financial distress firms are their conditions of the 
explanatory variables one year prior to the occurrence of financial distress.  A 
summary of descriptive statistics of variables in the sample is given in Table 1.  
Table 1 indicates that approximately 30.5%, 9.5%, and 9.6% of the sample firms 
changes auditor firm in the financial distress firms and financial healthy matched 
samples, respectively.  The ratio of business group’s cross-holding investments is 
approximately 17.8%, 20.8%, and 19.9% in the samples.  It seems that the financial 
distress firms have moderate business group’s cross-holding investments in 
comparison with their counterpart.  The β coefficients are 0.741, 0.778, and 0.751 in 
respective samples.  It suggests that both the financial distress and financial healthy 
firms have non-discrepancy β coefficients and can be grouped as defensive stock.   
There is approximately 53.3% of the financial distress firms incurred negative 
operating cash flow in the prior accounting year.  Yet, only 22% of the financial 
healthy firms incurred negative operating cash flow in the same accounting year.  
The ratios receiving unqualified audit report prior one year of the sampled firms are 
22.5%, 49.5%, and 53.8%, respectively.  It indicates that, to some extent, the audit 
quality suitably reflects the financial conditions in the samples.  Besides, the average 
financial distress index from Zmijewski’s [26] model in the respectively samples 
ranges from -0.156 to -2.142.  The average FDI of the financial distress firms is 
conspicuous larger than the matched samples which exhibits they currently face an 
4. Effect of Choice-based Sampling 
We have conducted many sets of experiments to examine the effect of choice-based 
sampling. We also compared the effects of different classification tools, namely the 
traditional logistic regression and the support vector machine. The settings of different 
experiments are summarized in Table 2.

The results are shown in the following subsections. 
4.1 Experiment 1 
The kernel function of the SVM used in this training is a Gaussian function with 
distribution from 0.5 (0.05||xi – xj||) to 2 (0.95||xi – xj||). In each experiment, we 
randomly pick two third of the 104 financial-distressed firms and match these data 
with a certain ratio of healthy firms as the training data set. The rest of 
financial-distressed firms are also matched with some healthy firms to serve as the 
testing data set. The training and testing results by SVM and logistic regression, 
respectively, are presented in Table 3. 
4.2 Experiment 2 
The threshold value used in the logistic regression is varied from 0.6 ~ 0.2 with step 
-0.01, and the selection criteria include the minimum number of error prediction of 
financial-distressed firm and the minimum number of overall error predictions. The 
training results are presented in Table 4. 
4.3 Experiment 3 
Due to the scarce of financial-distressed firms, it is difficult for the training models to 
learn the pattern of financial-distressed firms. Thus, in this experiment, we use 
duplicated data of financial-distressed firms in the training data set. The training 
results are shown in Table 5.

financial distress firm incorrectly classified as a healthy firm) and type 2 errors (i.e. a 
healthy firm being classified as a financial distress firm). Tables 6, 7 and 8 report the

6 Conclusions 
This study investigated the effect of choice-based sampling on the prediction accuracy 
of two prediction models, namely the support vector machine and the logistic 
regression analysis. Although choice-based sampling results in biased estimation, it is 
required in problems with unbalanced classes. In the financial distress prediction 
problem, the ratio of financial-distressed firms is only 1.43% of the entire population. 
The scarce of the financial-distressed samples make it very difficulty in solving such a 
problem. Our computational results demonstrated that the use of matched data in 
constructing training samples is necessary, because the use of truly random sample 
would result in very high type 1 errors.
