calculation of motion energy is simpler that dynamic 
equations developed in conventional literatures. 
The proposed idea also leads to separate the func-
tions of trunk and lower limbs in a walking gait.  The 
lower limbs play the role of moving the biped robot, but 
the trunk, for whole body balance, is designed to control 
ZMP on the sole of support leg.  Such function separa-
tion enables a biped robot to implement various walking 
styles. 
The organization of this paper is as follows.  This 
research also implements a prototype biped robot.  
Therefore, a biped robot designed by Cybernetic Robots 
Lab., National Kaohsiung First University of Science 
and Technology (NKFUST) is first described in section 2.  
Section 4 is the main idea of biped walking planning.  In 
this section, the definitions of walking pattern parame-
ters are also included.  The planning of walking pattern is 
in task space.  It is thus necessary to solve walking pat-
tern by inverse kinematics for all joint angles of the biped 
robot.  The inverse kinematics is derived in section 4.  
Motion energy of the biped robot is defined and analyzed 
for optimal trajectories in section 5.  Conclusions and 
discussions are made in section 6. 
 
2. Design of a Biped Robot 
The walking patterns proposed in this paper are 
eventually implemented in a biped robot, a prototype 
designed by Cybernetic Robots Lab. at National Kaoh-
siung First University of Science and Technology 
(NKFUST).  This paper thus starts with design of a biped 
robot in this section.  The mechanism and parameters of 
the bipedal robot are listed.  Its direct kinematics is then 
derived. 
The biped robot is designed for reliable walking 
and easy controlling.  These ideas become the center 
targets of realizing the structure and mechanism of the 
biped robot.  Biped robots are machines, which imitate 
human behaviors such as walking, standing, running, and 
so on.  In intuition, its structure design thus observes 
human mechanism how to finish walking, and to control 
body stably very well. 
According to human experience and biped robot 
development in future, the structure of the biped robot is 
designed under the following ideas: 
A. Easily balance with its heavy gravity on or even 
below waist during walking and alleviate loading by 
distributing links’ weight of both feet; 
B. Use aluminum alloy for alleviating weight and 
gaining enough hard; 
C. Use steel gear for providing enough steering force; 
D. Expansible structure and simple control; 
The built biped robot is symmetric to both feet, and each 
foot is able to move in three dimensions with six Degrees 
Of Freedom (DOFs).  Fig. 1 shows the mechanism of the 
biped robot designed with twelve DOFs.  As shown in 
Fig. 1, the biped robot owns fifteen links and twelve 
joints consisting of hip, thigh, knee, and ankle.  One foot 
has six DOFs, three DOFs in hip, one DOF in knee, and 
two DOFs in ankle, respectively.  The biped robot thus 
needs twelve motors for motion.  In addition, there is a 
virtual upper body, trunk, defined for studying the biped 
robot motion influenced by up limb.

All of the above transformation matrices are im-

phase as all joints at initial states.  In addition, MATLAB 
implements the other situation such as single support 
phase.  The implemented MATLAB demonstrates that 
the transformation matrices are correct.

3. Planning of Walking Patterns 
In this section, two 4-3-4 polynomials connected to 
compose the trajectories of biped robot waist and swing 
limb heel are described.  Both trajectories consist of 
walking patterns of the biped robot.  The parameters of 
walking patterns represented by the trajectory based on 
4-3-4 polynomials are figured out by four definitions.  
These definitions try to show up how to design the 
walking patterns based on the trajectory of 4-3-4 poly-
nomials.

swing leg heel. 
 
The notion of walking planning considers not only 
the location of swing limb heel but also that of the biped 
robot waist.  This notion is based on human walking that 
swing limb heel moves for striding a step, but waist 
moves to control the center of gravity for walking sta-
bility.  In the planning of walking patterns, there are thus 
two trajectories: the biped robot waist and the swing limb 
heel as shown in Fig. 3.  According to the two trajectories, 
all joint angle trajectories of the biped robot can be 
solved by its inverse kinematics, which will be derived in 
next section.  Assigning the locations of robot waist and 
swing limb heel during walking is more practical than 
only assigning that of swing limb heel in general walking 
pattern planning.  If all joint angles are solved according 
to only assigning the heel location, the waist and trunk of 
the biped robot solved by uncertain posture are an un-
practical solution.  Assigning the locations of not only 
heel but also waist lets the biped walking in stable pos-
ture be possible. 
There are two design issues about planning of both 
trajectories.  The first is how to design the whole tra-
jectories.  The trajectories considered in the planning are 
continuity.  The continuous trajectories of the swing limb 
heel and the biped robot waist make continuous joint 
angle trajectories possible.  There are many kinds of 
continuous polynomials such as three-cubic, five-cubic, 
4-3-4, and so on.  The 4-3-4 polynomial is famous for 
designing continuous function [15].  It can be used to 
design velocity and acceleration as well.  The 4-3-4 
polynomial is thus used to design the trajectories of waist 
and heel for the walking planning.  The second is how to 
choose the better trajectory.  The choice of the better 
trajectory is based on wasting motion energy of the biped 
robot.  In section 5, motion energy are defined for com-
paring the biped robot in distinct trajectories. 
In a 4-3-4 polynomial, there are four points, initial, 
lift-off, set-down and final, that designer can designate.  
Let the times of the four points be t0, t1, t2, and tf.  The 
4-3-4 polynomial needs three functions to connect the 
four points as follows ( ) 10112123134141 atatatatath ++++=  (20) ( ) 20212223232 atatatath +++=  (21) 
( ) 01223344 ffffff atatatatath ++++=  (22) 
where h1(t) connects the points between t0 and t1, h2(t) 
connects the points between t1 and t2, and hf(t) connects 
the points between t2 and tf.  Robot move trajectory at 
least needs the continuity of position, velocity and ac-
celeration for smoothing manipulation.  One point in the 
continuous trajectory thus possesses three boundary 
conditions, position, velocity and acceleration.  Added 
two boundary conditions of the positions located at 
lift-off and set-down points, there are fourteen boundary 
conditions in total.  Fourteen boundary conditions for 
solving the 4-3-4 polynomial are consistent with the 
coefficients of the three functions. 
ωl,0 ≡ (z1-zi)/(t1-ti). (25) 
On the other hand, it is not easy to approach a uniform 
value of lift-off acceleration.  The 4-3-4 polynomial de-
signed for robot acceleration products lift-off force lo-
cated at t1.  Therefore, the acceleration located at time t1 
is an interesting value as follows 
αl,0 = αl(t1) = 12a14 21t  + 6a13t1 + 2a12 (26) 
Definition 4: set-down velocity and deceleration, ωs and 
αs, respectively. 
The set-down velocity and acceleration are re-
spectively the velocity and acceleration as the biped 
robot limb touches the ground.  From Eq. (22), the 
mathematical manipulation can obtain 
ωs = 4af4t3 + 3af3t2 + 2af2t + af1, and (27) 
αs = 12af4t2 + 6af3t + 2af2, respectively. (28) 
The set-down velocity can be also approached as 
ωs,0 ≡ (zf-z5)/(tf-t5). (29) 
Besides, the interesting deceleration is 
αs,0 = αs(t5) = 12af4 25t  + 6af3t5 + 2af2 (30). 
Notice that the heel and waist trajectories of biped 
robots defined by Zh(x) and Zw(x), respectively, are 
functions of x(t), but the variable x(t) can be transferred 
into time scale for Zh(x) and Zw(x) related to time t.  It is 
then easy to solve the velocity and acceleration of heel 
and waist trajectories based on two 4-3-4 polynomials.  
For example, the trajectory shown in Fig. 5 plans to 
perform a stride SH = 80 mm and SL = 60 mm.  If the time 
scale of the trajectory is designed by 6 ms, then 
(z1-zi)/(x1-xi) = 20/10 = 3.  Thus, ωl,0 is 30 mm/sec. 
The velocity and acceleration of biped robot limbs 
is vital during walking.  Conventional researches only 
take care of velocity and acceleration for optimal energy 
consumption.  However, the force relied on the velocity 
and acceleration of biped robot limbs is not just energy 
consumption, but is very useful for a biped robot in spe-
cial ground condition such as slip plane or in special 
walking styles [14].  The walking pattern based on 4-3-4 
polynomials provides the parameters such as ωl, αl, ωs 
and αs to design desired force for biped robot walking.  
Hence, the optimal energy consumption studied in this 
paper is the walking patterns designed for a desired ve-
locity and acceleration.  The desired velocity and accel-
eration include lift-off velocity and acceleration, and 
set-down velocity and acceleration as definitions 3 and 4. 
 
4. Inverse Kinematics for joint angle trajectories 
Inverse kinematics solves joint angles as the loca-
tions of the biped robot waist and the swing limb heel 
decided by a walking pattern.  It is thus crucial for in-
verse kinematic equations to implement biped walking 
patterns.  There are two sets of inverse kinematic equa-
tions for the support and swing limbs, respectively.  For 
the support limbs, the inverse kinematic equations solve 
the joint angles to put the waist location on its trajectory 
and the support limb on fixed location.  On the other 
hand, the inverse kinematic equations for the swing 
limbs solve the joint angles for the waist and swing limb 
heel to follow both trajectories simultaneously. 
Fig. 6 is a posture model of the bipedal robot.  In 
the posture model, a support point under the support limb 
sole and the waist location decide the angles of the sup-
port limb joints.  Besides, the locations of waist and 
swing limb heel decide the angle trajectories of the swing 
leg joints.  Note that the walking patterns planning only 
consider the bipedal robot in sagittal plane.

inverse kinematics are necessary for the biped robot joint 
angles to solve the support limbs from [0 0 0]T to [Xw 0 
Zw]T, and the swing limbs from [Xw 0 Zw]T to [XF 0 ZF]T, 
respectively.  The inverse kinematics for the joint angles 
of the support limbs is derived in the following.  Based 
on the coordinate systems of all joints as shown in Fig. 1, 
direct kinematics between [0 0 0]T and [Xw 0 Zw]T is ( ) ( ) ( )

The solution of Eq. (31) is the inverse kinematics 
between the support limb sole and the biped robot waist.  
The following lemma solves this inverse kinematics. 
Lemma 1: In sagittal plane as shown in Fig. 6, the in-
verse kinematics of the biped robot between [0 0 0]T and 
[Xw 0 Zw]T is 
According to both the waist and heel trajectories, 
the inverse kinematic equations are able to solve the an-
gle trajectories of the biped robot joints.  Fig. 7b shows 
the trajectories of all joints as the trajectories of the biped 
robot waist and the swing limb heel are Fig. 7a.  There 
are two cases of the solutions from inverse kinematic 
equations as shown in Fig. 7b.  Fig. 8 shows the stick 
diagrams of the planned walking pattern solved by the 
biped kinematics of case I and II.  As shown in Fig. 8, 
Case I is more similar to human walking pattern. 
The kinematic solutions, Cases I and II, are com-
pared by ZMP yielded by the angle trajectories of all 
joints.  The ZMP trajectories of case I and II are shown in 
Fig. 9.  During this single support phase, the sole of the 
support limb lays on region x = [-30 0] mm as shown in 
Fig. 8.  The Case I ZMP on this support region is in the 
time period t = [1.1 1.9] second as shown in Fig. 9.  This 
period almost is the center time of the single support 
phase, but case II produces narrow time period of the 
ZMP on the support sole.  Based on the comparison of 
the ZMP trajectories, Case I is better than Case II.  Both 
cases will be also compared by wasting motion energy in 
next section for discussing the choice of inverse kine-
matic equations. 
 
5. Analysis of Motion Energy 
After having the form of walking patterns, the bi-
ped robot needs rules to design better polynomials of 
both heel and waist trajectories.  The rules proposed here 
is based motion energy for the biped walking.  In this 
section, the motion energy is defined for the choice of 
better walking pattern formed by the 4-3-4 polynomials 
for the trajectories of the biped robot waist and the swing 
limb heel.  The analysis of the parameters how to influ-
ence the motion energy for easy way to show up the 
better walking pattern is also included. 
It is reasonable that walking patterns of a biped 
robot for optimization are designed according to motion 
energy.  It is also well known that the motion energy of a 
body includes kinetic and potential energy.  Thus, two 
kinds of motion energy, kinetic and potential are defined.  
The kinetic energy produced by linear and rotation ve-
locity is

6. Conclusions and Discussions 
In this paper, the walking patterns based on two 
4-3-4 polynomials composed for both heel and waist 
trajectories are proposed.  The 4-3-4 polynomial allows 
the walking pattern trajectories to design not only posi-
tion but also velocity and acceleration.  This feature 
makes appropriate torque designed for lift-off and 
set-down limb possible.  For exactly implementing this 
idea, the mechanism of a biped robot is designed, and its 
direct and inverse kinematics is derived.  There are two 
solutions, cases I and II, for the angle trajectories of all 
joints solved by the derived inverse kinematics as both 
heel and waist trajectories are given.  The analysis of the 
ZMP trajectory produced by the angle trajectories of all 
joints shows up that the inverse kinematics of case I 
similar to human walking pattern benefits easy mainte-
nance of the biped robot ZMP under its support limb 
sole. 
In addition, the walking pattern proposed in this 
paper is analyzed for optimal trajectories of both the 
biped robot waist and the swing limb heel.  The optimal 
procedure is based the defined motion energy.  By ex-
periments, the motion energy of the swing limb heel tra-
jectory is dependent on its highest vertical level.  In other 
words, increasing the highest vertical level of the swing 
limb heel wastes more motion energy.  Consequently, it 
is reasonable that the optimal walking pattern only fo-
cuses on the initial knot and the highest vertical level of 
the biped robot waist trajectory.  A development pro-
cedure summarizes the optimal planning of the walking 
pattern.
