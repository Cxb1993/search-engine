to form composite particles with MnO2. Other than 
acting as a binder to bound together MnO2 particles, 
the SAP is believed to facilitate distribution of 
electrolyte throughout the active layer owing to its 
electrolyte-absorbing and swelling behaviors. The Cs 
of MnO2 remains almost unchanged as the oxide loading 
varies over a wide range (1.5~6.5 mg cm-2) of heavy 
active-material loading. In addition, putting PAA 
throughout the entire active layer helps to magnify 
the specific interaction between PAA and MnO2 that is 
known to enhance the capacitance of individual MnO2 
particles. The success in combining both high Cs and 
high active-material loading results in GCD of ca. 
1.8~1.4 F cm-2 even under very high current densities 
(ca. 35~260 mA cm-2 or 5~40 A g-1-MnO2).

The second category of the fadingmechanisms attributes capac-
itance reduction to the mechanical failure of electrode structure
causedbycyclic volumetric variationsof theMnO2 crystallitesupon
cycling [9,16]. The structural failure leads to increasingly deterio-
rating electrical contact between the constituent particles within
the electrode, leading to an increase in overall resistance and hence
in energy loss. Capacitance fading by this mechanism is insensitive
to operating potential and can effectively be alleviated by increas-
ing binder content to enhance the mechanical robustness of the
electrode structure [16].
This paper describes an investigation on the long-term elec-
trochemical behaviors of MnO2 electrodes upon being cycled over
potential ranges extending to different potentials below the open-
circuit potential (OCP) of the oxide electrode. The object of this
study is twofold. Firstly, it intends tounderstand the effect of reduc-
ing potential end on the capacitance fading process, if any, in terms
of fading rate and eventual capacitance loss. Secondly, it intends to
link the electrochemical behaviors of the oxide electrode with its
chemical and structural characteristics that evolve during cycling.
2. Experimental
MnO2·nH2O particles were prepared by mixing 0.15M KMnO4
and 0.15M MnSO4 aqueous solutions with a Mn(VII)/Mn(II) molar
ratio of 2:3 at 25 ◦C. After being thoroughlywashedwith de-ionized
water, the particles were ﬁnally dried at 200 ◦C for 1h in air. To
prepare the electrode, slurry containing the oxide powder, acety-
lene black (AB), andbinder (polyvinylidenediﬂuoride; Aldrich)was
coated onto Ti foils, and ﬁnally dried at 120 ◦C for 6h in vacuum
to form oxide layers of 30–35m in thickness. On the dry basis,
the oxide to AB ratio was 7:3, while the binder, which used N-
methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, Mitsubishi Chemical) as the dispersing
solvent, had a weight composition of 14%. Such a high binder con-
tent employed in the present study was intended to give sufﬁcient
binding strength to minimize capacitance fading due to deteriora-
tion of electrode structure [16].
Electrochemical characterizations, including cyclic voltamme-
try (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were
carried out on an electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie PGSTAT30)
with a beaker-type electrochemical cell. The cell was equipped
with a working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode, and
an Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl (EG&G, 197mV versus NHE at 25 ◦C) ref-
erence electrode. All the potentials mentioned hereafter are based
on this reference electrode. The electrolyte was aqueous 1M KCl
with pH=6, while the potential scan rate was ﬁxed at 50mVs−1.
Potential scan has been started and ended at the lower-end poten-
tial, unless otherwise noted. The capacitance of the electrode was
determined from the voltammograms according to the following
equation:
Cavg = V−1
∫
I−1dV (1)
where Cavg is the average speciﬁc capacitance, V is the scanned
potential window, I is the current, and  is the potential scan rate.
EIS analyses were carried out at 0.4V with the frequency ranging
from 10mHz to 60kHz and a voltage amplitude of 10mV.
Prior to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the oxide electrodes were
washed with de-ionized water and dried in a drying cabinet at
room temperature. Surface morphology was examined by a ﬁeld-
emission SEM (FE-SEM LEO-1730). XPS analysis employed an Al K
X-ray source operated at 15kV and 100W, and used a beam size of
400m and pass energy of 20eV for spectrum acquisition. Sput-
tering gun was operated at 3kV and 1A with a sputtering area of
2mm×2mm and sputtering time of 10 s.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1a shows the voltammogramofMnO2·nH2O electrodemea-
sured within the potential range of −0.2V and 0.8V. While nearly
parallel curves are clearly obtained for the cathodic and anodic
branches between +0.2V and +0.8V, a prominent reduction tail
occurs toward the lower-end potential. By taking the derivative
of the cathodic branch of the curve, as shown in Fig. 1b, one can
identify different electrochemical behaviors within three differ-
ent potential ranges. Above 0.2V, Range I, the derivative, dI/dV, is
close to zero. It is a capacitive behavior, as the cathodic current
I is essentially constant. Between 0.0V and 0.2V, Range II, dI/dV
showed a small and broad peak, which indicates the existence of a
reduction event. Indeed, one can observe a shallow hump in the CV
plot (Fig. 1a) within this potential range. Finally, below 0.0V, the
dI/dV values increase steeply with decreasing potential, indicating
a major reductive event.
The pseudocapacitance of MnO2 has been attributed to the
redox transitions of superﬁcial oxy-cation species at various oxi-
dation states. The charge-transfer process is then balanced by
insertion/extractionof cations, suchasproton, in theelectrolyte [9].
The potential–pH diagram for a manganese–water system shown
by Pourbaix [19] indicates several thermodynamically stable man-
ganese oxides, such as Mn3O4, Mn2O3, and MnO2, containing
manganese with different oxidation states within the scanned
potential range of this study. Therefore, the charge-transferring
reactionswhich lead to the pseudocapacitance ofMnO2 could actu-
ally lead to the formation of the above-mentioned manganese
oxides.
The long-term behavior of MnO2 electrode was thus investi-
gated over the potential ranges that respectively cover the three
potential ranges marked in Fig. 1a. For brevity, the electrodes are

reduction of Mn valence on the cycled electrodes is permanent
and not affected by the starting/ending potentials of the cycling
processes.
3.2. SEM analysis
The fresh electrode was found to contain nano-ﬂakes of the
oxide and rounded AB particles (Fig. 3a). Comparison of Fig. 3a and
b (after 3000 cycles) reveals no obvious change in morphologies,
indicating that the morphology of MnO2 electrode is not signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuenced by cycling within the potential range covering
Range I. In contrast, the SEM micrograph (Fig. 3c) reveals that the
initial nano-ﬂake structurehasevolved into thepetal-likemorphol-
ogy after cycling covering Range II. The curved petals are packed
with void and formed a macroporous open structure. On the other
hand, the morphology of cycled S(−0.2, 0.8) electrode changes to
needle-tipped ﬂakes (Fig. 3d). As suggested by Wei et al. [18],
the morphological evolution from a compact nano-ﬂake structure
into a more open structure may follow a dissolution–precipitation
mechanism.
3.3. Electrochemical performances
3.3.1. Potential range: 0.2–0.8V
Fig. 4a shows the cycle performance of S(0.2, 0.8) electrode. The
capacitances have been normalized with respective to the capac-
itance of the second cycle, of which the speciﬁc capacitance is
71.5 F g−1 (at 50mVs−1). The speciﬁc capacitance of the electrode is
fairly stable. Fig. 4b presents the voltammogramsof selected cycles.
All the curves exhibit nearly rectangular proﬁles and they look very
similar except for a growing small reduction tail appearing near
0.2V. As described before, the XPS data (Table 1) indicated a reduc-
tion in the amount of the hygroscopic function groups after cycling.
As the capacitance is unchanged, the data may suggest that the

to capacitance enhancement during the initial cycles. In addi-
tion, the growing intensity of the partially reversible redox couple
between 0.0V and 0.2V can also contribute the rise in the capac-
itance. On the other hand, the irreversible surface reduction of
Mn oxide results in surface passivation, causing increasing charge-
transfer resistance and hence capacitance reduction after longer
cycles.
3.3.3. Potential ranges: ≤−0.1V to 0.8V
Fig. 7a summarizes the capacitance variation versus cycle num-
ber for three different cycling potential windows, including (−0.3V
to 0.8V), (−0.2V to 0.8V) and (−0.1V to 0.8V). One common fea-
ture among these curves is that the capacitance decreases over a
certain period of initial cycles and then levels off at a rather sta-
ble value for at least another several thousand cycles. This trend
suggests a scenario that the structure and/or composition of the
electrode evolve toward a new stable state during initial period of
cycling in response to the selected cycling potential window. Once
the stable state is reached, the properties, including capacitance,
of the electrode remains largely unchanged upon further cycling.
It is also noticed that this ﬁnal stable capacitance decreases most
dramatically when the lower limit of the scanned potential range
is lowered from −0.1V to −0.2V.
Fig. 7b presents the voltammograms of selected cycles for elec-
trode S(−0.2, 0.8). One clearly sees a prominent reduction tail
below 0.0V for the initial cycles. However, there is no additional
oxidation counter-part occurs during the anodic scan. Thus, this
reduction event is far less reversible than the redox couple occur-
ring between 0.0V and 0.2V as observed on S(0.0, 0.8) (Fig. 5b).
Upon cycling, while the capacitance decreases, the intensity of this

low-potential reduction event is also diminishing. The reduction
tail is no longer recognizablewhen the capacitance reaches a stable
value after nearly 1000 cycles. Before the capacitance of the elec-
trode reaches the plateau, the total amount of charge passed during
the cathodic scan (QC) was found to be higher than that during the
anodic scan (QA), suggesting irreversible electrode reduction. This
is again consistent with the XPS data (Table 1), which indicates
that the Mn valence of the oxide electrode surface dropped to 2.2.
The ﬁnding of oxide reduction under the present potential range
is consistent with the XANES study of Nam et al. [17], who, how-
ever, have not identiﬁed the existence of the capacitance-stable
states.
Strictly speaking, the capacitance reduction observed here does
not exactly conform to the general concept of “capacitance fading”,
which typically refers to indeﬁnite capacitance loss in an uncon-
trollable manner. Under such circumstances, no stable capacitance
is expected. The dissolution mechanism, for instance, may imply
ever decreasing capacitance, as dissolution of Mn oxide electrode
continuously occur upon cycling. This is in contrast to what were
observed in the present study, where rather stable capacitances
were reached after certain cycles even the lower-end potential was
lowered down to −0.3V (versus Ag/AgCl). Each stable capacitance
is believed to correspond to a steady-state surface chemistry and
microstructure.
Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots of selected cycles for S(−0.2, 0.8)
electrode. Compared with those of S(0.0, 0.8) electrode (Fig. 6),
S(−0.2, 0.8) electrode exhibits much higher charge-transfer resis-
tance after experiencing the same number of cycles. It is believed
that the signiﬁcant capacitance reduction taking place particularly
for cycling below −0.1V is due mainly to the formation of inactive
surface species. The SEM (Fig. 3d) and XPS (Table 1) data, on the
other hand, indicate that these surface inactive species are different
from those formed in S(0.0, 0.8) electrode, as different morpholo-
gies and Mn ion valences were detected on these two electrodes.
The exact crystallographic nature of the resulting surface species
is not certain at this point. While the valence value (2.2; Table 1)
is close to that of either MnO or Mn(OH)2, bulk MnO and Mn(OH)2
are known to be thermodynamically unstable under the present
bulk electrolyte condition (pH=6.0) [19]. As the surface species are
likely non-stoichiometric, its (or their) thermodynamic behaviors
may not be determined from the phase diagrams of bulk oxides.
From the viewpoint of practical operation, an increase in oper-
ating potential window can increase the stored energy density.
However, the presence study indicates that the widening of poten-
tial window will suffer from dramatic capacitance reduction below
certain potential.
Long-Term Charge/Discharge Cycling Stability of MnO2
Aqueous Supercapacitor under Positive Polarization
Fatemeh Ataherian and Nae-Lih Wu*,z
Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan
The long-term charge/discharge cycling stability of MnO2 electrode under positive polarization in aqueous KCl electrolyte has
been studied over different potential windows spanning from the open circuit potential to varied higher-end potential limited by
O2 evolution. Cycling up to 1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl(aq)) causes partial (35%) capacitance fading to a plateau value within the initial
cycles, accompanied by morphological reconstruction, reduction of surface Mn ions and oxygen evolution. The surface Mn-ion
reduction has been attributed to a two-step oxidation–reduction mechanism involving OH oxidation in electrolyte, based on elec-
trochemical analysis. When cycling potential extends to 1.4 V, extensive oxygen evolution takes place. The combination of surface
passivation of current collector and extensive gas bubbling, which deteriorates electrical contact among the constituent particles
within the electrode, results in further monotonic capacitance reduction.

Supercapacitors are used primarily for application that require a
high power output and a good cycle stability.1,2 Supercapacitors
based on manganese oxides as active material are currently attracting a
lot of interest due to its relatively low cost, excellent electrochemical
performance, and the environment-friendly characteristics.3–14 Even
though studies on manganese oxide supercapacitors usually highlight
the long term usage limitations of the electrode in an aqueous electro-
lyte,15–20 its capacitance fading mechanism is still unclear. It has been
shown that electrochemical stability is closely related to physicochemi-
cal feature evolution of the electrodes during cycling.21–23
The long-term cycling stability of an amorphous MnO2 electrode
in aqueous electrolyte under negative polarization has been investi-
gated in our previous study.23 Cycling within the potential range
between 0.2 and 0.8 V [vs. Ag/AgCl] results in no change in either
microstructure or surface chemistry of the oxide electrode, and no
appreciable capacitance reduction takes place. Cycling down to
0.0 V leads to extensive morphological reconstruction along with
limited reduction of surface Mn ions, while the electrode capaci-
tance remains stable. Extending the lower-end of potential below
0.0 V results in obvious capacitance reduction concomitantly with
significant morphological reconstruction and Mn reduction.23
Cycling under positive polarization exceeding the thermody-
namic O2 evolution potential (i.e., 0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl in neutral
electrolyte17), has been shown to cause capacitance fading, but the
fading mechanism is not yet fully understood. While Brousse et
al.17 reported the limitations seemed to be related with oxygen evo-
lution reaction at the positive electrode, Khomenko et al.18 ascribed
the fading to irreversible Mn(IV) to Mn(VII) reaction.
This paper presents an investigation on the electrochemical
behaviors of manganese oxide upon being cycled over different
potential ranges above the open circuit potential (OCP) of the oxide
electrode, extending to above O2 evolution potential. Evolution of
the morphology and chemical state of the Mn oxides upon charge/
discharge cycling are discussed.
Experimental
MnO2nH2O particles were prepared by mixing 0.15 M KMnO4
and 0.15 M MnSO4 aqueous solutions with a Mn(VII)/Mn(II) molar
ratio of 2:3 at 25C. After being thoroughly washed with de-ionized
water, the particles were finally heated at 200C for 1 h in air. To
prepare the electrode, slurry containing the oxide powder, acetylene
black (AB), and PVdF was coated onto Ti foils, and finally dried at
120C for 6 h in vacuum. On the dry basis, the oxide to AB ratio
was at 7:3, while the binder, which used N-methyl pyrrolidone
(NMP, Mitsubishi Chemical) as the dispersing solvent, had a weight
composition of 14%.
Electrochemical characterizations, including cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were car-
ried out with a beaker-type electrochemical cell. The cell was
equipped with a working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode,
and an Ag/AgCl, saturated KCl (EG&G, 197 mV vs. NHE at 25C)
reference electrode. All the potentials mentioned hereafter are based
on this reference electrode. The electrolyte was aqueous 1 M KCl
with pH of 7 while the potential scan rate was fixed at 50 mVs1,
unless otherwise noted. Potential scan has been started and ended at
the lower-end potential. The capacitance of the electrode was deter-
mined from the voltammograms according to the following equation:
Cavg ¼ DV1
ð
Is1dV [1]
where Cavg is the average specific capacity, DV is the scanned poten-
tial window, I is current, and s is voltage scan rate. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the potential of 0.4
V vs. Ag/AgCl. Electrochemical tests were carried out on an elec-
trochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie PGSTAT30).
Subsequent to cycling, the electrodes were washed with deion-
ized water and dried at room temperature prior to scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analyses. Surface morphology was examined by a field-emission
SEM (FE-SEM LEO-1730). XPS analysis employed an Al K x-ray
source operated at 15 kV and 100 W, and used a beam size of 400
lm and pass energy of 20 eV for spectrum acquisition. Sputtering
gun was operated at 3 kV and 1 lA with a sputtering area of 2 2
mm and sputtering time of 10 min.
Results and Discussion
Electrochemical performances.—The cyclic voltammogram
(CV) of MnO2nH2O electrode measured within the potential range
of 0.4–1.4 V in 1M KCl with the scan rate of 50 mVs1 is depicted
in Fig. 1. While nearly parallel curves are clearly obtained for the
cathodic and anodic branches betweenþ0.4 andþ0.8 V, a promi-
nent tail occurs toward the higher-end potential. By taking the deriv-
ative of the anodic branch of the curve, as shown in Fig. 1a, one can
identify different electrochemical behaviors within different poten-
tial ranges. While below 0.8 V, the derivative (dI=dV) is close to
zero, between 0.8 and 1.2 V, dI=dV shows one obvious peak, which
indicates the existence of an oxidation event. Finally, around 1.4 V,
dI=dV values increases steeply with increasing potential, indicating
another oxidation event.

gated over three different potential windows. The electrodes are

started to change into a petal-like morphology after cycling within
the potential 0.4–1.0 V. Figure 5c confirmed severe morphological
evolution induced by varying the upper cut-off potential to 1.2 V.
Expanding the higher limit of applied potential to 1.4 V is accompa-
nied with particle fracture into smaller oxide particles which
increases the electrode surface porosity (Fig. 5d).
XPS analysis.—The cycled (1000 cycles) electrodes are sub-
jected to XPS analysis for determining the oxidation state of Mn
located at the electrode surfaces. Figure 6 shows the Mn3s spectra
while the associated data are summarized in Table I. The Mn3s
spectrum shows peak splitting due to the parallel spin coupling of
the 3s electron with the 3d electron during the photoelectron ejec-
tion. A linear correlation between the energy separation DEð Þ of
these two peaks and the valence of Mn has been suggested.26–28 By
reference to the DEð Þ values for MnO (5.79 eV), Mn3O4 (5.50 eV),
Mn2O3 (5.41 eV), and MnO2 (4.78 eV) (Ref. 26) the valences of
Mn ions at different electrode surfaces are estimated. As shown in
Table I, the Mn valence of the fresh electrode isþ3.7.
The O1s spectrum (Fig. 6a; Table I) showed a sharp peak cen-
tered at 530 eV and a broad peak of lower intensity extending
over higher binding energy range. The former may be attributed to
O in the Mn  O  Mn bonding configuration, while the latter to

Photosynthetic water oxidation is a fundamental chemical reaction
that sustains the biosphere and takes place at a catalytic Mn4-Ca site

Today it is generally agreed that four Mn ions bounded to the
protein matrix of photosystem facilitate the use of water as an elec-
tron source for the photosynthesis of carbohydrates.32 A hypothesis
on the mechanism of dioxygen formation which has been proposed
based on x-ray absorption Spectroscopy data, sketched in Fig. 8.
According to this hypothesis, water oxidation is facilitated by man-
ganese reduction that is coupled to proton transfer from water to
bridging oxides.33
The first step is likely to involve H-atom abstraction from
Mn  OH or Mn  OH2 group which electrochemically leads to
MnðVÞ ¼ O formation (the anodic peak shown in Fig. 1). Outer-
sphere water molecules presumably bound by hydrogen bond to
l-oxo bridge plays the starting role in water absorption step. It seems
that in this step l-oxo bridge serves as proton accepting base and
reduces adjacent MnðIVÞ to MnðIIIÞ ion. The resulting outer-sphere
hydroxyl radical is optimally positioned to enable O  O bond forma-
tion due to favorable orbital overlap with the singly occupied
Mn  O	 p-orbital. Hydroperoxo ligand formed is transformed into a
peroxo radical by reduction of vicinal MnðIVÞ to MnðIIIÞ ion and sec-
ond l-oxo protonation. Subsequently oxidation of the peroxoradical
releases dioxygen accompanied with MnðIIIÞ to MnðIIÞ reduction.
It seems that that the significant capacitance reduction taking
place for the S(0.4,1.0) and S(0.4,1.2) electrodes, as well as the first-

ended at the lower-end of the voltage window. The capacitance of the
electrode was determined from the voltammograms according to the
following equation:
Cavg ¼ ΔV−1∫Is−1dV
where Cavg is the average speciﬁc capacitance, ΔV is the scanned po-
tential or voltage window, I is current, and s is voltage scan rate.
Subsequent to cycling, the electrodes were washed with deionized
water and dried at room temperature prior to x-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) analyses. XPS analysis employed an Al K X-ray source
operated at 15 kV and 100W, and used a beam size of 400 μm and
pass energy of 20 eV for spectrum acquisition. Sputtering gunwas oper-
ated at 3 kV and 1 μAwith a sputtering area of 2×2 mm2 and sputtering
time of 2 min.
3. Result and discussion
The fresh MnO2 particles are agglomerates of nanoﬂakes with the
widths in the range of 10–30 nm [3]. The cycling stability of single
MnO2 electrode within the potential window of −0.2 to 0.4 V was
tested by using CV scanning, and the variations of speciﬁc capacitance
under different conditions are summarized in Fig. 1a. First, in order to
investigate the effect of oxygen dissolved in electrolyte, the electrolyte
was purged with either argon or air for at least 1 h prior to measure-
ments. Hereafter, the electrodes cycled in Ar-purged electrolyte, air-
purged electrolyte and blank electrolyte (electrolyte without any
prior gas-purging treatment) are denoted as S–Ar, S–O2 and S–B, re-
spectively. The S–B electrode has an initial speciﬁc capacitance
65 Fg−1 at 50 mV s−1 based on the mass of entire active-layer. As
shown in Fig. 1a, the capacitance of the S–B electrode initially de-
creases monotonously within the ﬁrst 1000 cycles and then levels off
at ca. 50% of the initial value. The capacitance of the S–Ar electrode,
which has an initial speciﬁc capacitance of 58 Fg−1, exhibits very sim-
ilar fading pattern. They are consistent with our previous ﬁndings [3].
In great contrast, the S–O2 electrode, which has a slightly higher spe-
ciﬁc capacitance (77 Fg−1), shows no fading up to 3000 cycles.
Fig. 1b illustrates the voltammograms of selected cycles of the S–B
electrode. One clearly sees a prominent reduction tail below 0.0 V for
the initial cycles, while there is no additional oxidation counterpart
occurring during the anodic scan. Upon continuous cycling, while
the capacitance decreases, the intensity of the low-potential reduction
tail also diminishes. The reduction tail is no longer recognizable when
the capacitance fades to the plateau value after ca. 1000 cycles. Before
the capacitance of the electrode reaches the plateau, the total amount
of charge passed during each cathodic scan is always higher than that
of the corresponding anodic scan, suggesting irreversible electrode re-
duction. As shown in our previous study [3], the average Mn valence
on the electrode surface has been reduced to +2.0 after cycling.
The data of the S–O2 electrode (Fig. 1a and c), on the other hand,
clearly indicates that the capacitance fading problem is alleviated by
increasing the oxygen content in the electrolyte. These results suggest
that the dissolved oxygen be involved in maintaining the electrode
activity. One notes that MnO2 materials have also been studied as al-
ternative cathodic catalysts to platinum (Pt) in air-cathode microbial
fuel cells (MFCs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [6,7]. In such a
process, the reduced Mn(III) species transfer electron to the O2 mole-
cule and itself is oxidized back to Mn(IV), i.e.,
2MnðIIIÞ þ 1=2O2 þ H2O↔2MnðIVÞ þ 2OH− ð1Þ
This process is facilitated by the fact that the Mn(III)/Mn(IV) redox
potential is close to the onset potential of the ORR [8]. It is inferred
that the same ORR helps to pass electrons to the dissolved oxygen
in the electrolyte when MnO2 is negatively charged to below 0.0 V
in the O2-saturated electrolyte in the S–O2 cell so that the formation

same cycling conditions. This full-cell apparently exhibits a much
more complex fading history than that of single electrode under neg-
ative polarization (Fig. 1a). This may suggest adverse interaction be-
tween the two electrodes in a full-cell conﬁguration when the cell is
running over unstable voltage range.
4. Conclusion
Capacitance fading of MnO2 supercapacitor electrode under nega-
tive polarization below 0.0 V arises from irreversible formation of inac-
tive Mn(II) surface species. In view of the fact that this potential limit is
close to the onset potential of MnO2-catalyzed ORR, the fading problem
has been tackled by passing the accumulated electrons in the oxide
electrode to the dissolved oxygen molecules via the ORR in order to
suppress the formation of the Mn(II) species. This has successfully
been demonstrated by either increasing the dissolved oxygen content
in the electrolyte or using the Ti(IV)/Ti(III) redox as a charge-transfer
mediator to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of MnO2 for ORR. As
a result, the reduction potential limit has been lowered to−0.2 V, and
a 1.2 V MnO2 symmetric electrochemical supercapacitor with remark-
able capacitance retention over more than 10,000 cycles has been
achieved by using Ti(IV)-containing neutral electrolyte (1 M KCl(aq)).

A new type of asymmetric supercapacitor containing a MnFe2O4 negative electrode and a LiMn2O4 posi-
tive electrode in aqueous LiNO3 electrolyte has been synthesized and characterized. The nanocrystalline
MnFe2O4 anodematerial has a speciﬁc capacitance of 99 F g−1 and the LiMn2O4 cathode a speciﬁc capacity
of 130–100mAhg−1 under 10–100C rate. The cell has amaximum operating voltage window of ca. 1.3V,
limited by irreversible reaction of MnFe2O4 toward reducing potential. The speciﬁc power and speciﬁc
energy of the full-cell increase with increasing anode-to-cathode mass ratio (A/C) and saturate at A/C
∼4.0, which gives speciﬁc cell energies, based on total mass of the two electrodes, of 10 and 5.5Whkg−1
at 0.3 and 1.8 kWkg−1, respectively. The cell shows good cycling stability and exhibits signiﬁcantly slower
self-discharge rate than either theMnFe2O4 symmetric cell or the other asymmetric cells having the same
cathode but different anode materials, including activated carbon ﬁber and MnO2.

1. Introduction
Asymmetric supercapacitors are promising energy storage
devices, being capable of charging/discharging faster than batteries
andhavinghigher energydensities than traditional electric double-
layer capacitors (EDLCs). Based on the electrochemical properties
of the electrode materials, they can in general be divided into two
major categories. The ﬁrst kind of asymmetric supercapacitors con-
tains two electrodes of different materials exhibiting capacitive
behavior over different potential ranges so that the overall oper-
ation voltage window of the cell can be enlarged and its energy
density becomes greater than the symmetric cells containing solely
either kind of the electrodes [1–3]. The second type combines a
battery electrode with a capacitor electrode in one cell [4–6]. As
the battery electrode charges/discharges at a plateau potential,
the cell is capable of storing a greater amount of energy than the
symmetric cell of the capacitive electrodes even within the same
operating voltage window. Most of the existing examples of this
category [5,6], such as activated carbon (AC)/PbO2 and AC/NiO,
employ an EDLC material for the capacitor electrode. The only cell,
to our knowledge, that uses pseudocapacitve material for this pur-
pose isMnO2/LiMn2O4 [7]withaLi+-containingorganic electrolyte.
However, the cell was not tested for cycle-life and self-discharge
characteristics.
Nanocrystalline MnFe2O4 is a pseudocapacitive material pos-
sesses high-power delivering capability [8–10]. In contrast to
MnO2-based pseudocapacitive materials, which are essentially

amorphous, MnFe2O4 exhibits pseudocapacitance in crystalline
form, and its symmetric cell has been shown to exhibit superior
cycling stability than the amorphous-MnO2 ones in aqueous elec-
trolytes [9]. In this work, a new type of asymmetric supercapacitor
which consists of a MnFe2O4-carbon black composite, abbreviated
asMnFe2O4@C, anode anda LiMn2O4 cathodehasbeen synthesized
and characterized for its fundamental operating characteristics,
including energy and power capabilities, cycling stability and self-
discharge behavior.
2. Experimental
The preparation procedure for theMnFe2O4@C composite pow-
der, which has an oxide-to-carbon mass ratio of 74:26, has been
described in detail elsewhere [8,9]. In brief, aqueous solution con-
taining MnSO4 and FeCl3 (Mn2+:Fe3+ =1:2) and predetermined
amount of carbon black powder was simultaneously introduced
into a 1.5M NaOH(aq) solution under vigorous stirring. Black pre-
cipitate formed immediately upon mixing, and was subsequently
washed with de-ionized water to remove residual anions. Finally,
the powder was dried in air at 50 ◦C, followed by calcination at
350 ◦C in N2 for 2h. LiMn2O4 was a courtesy from Industrial Tech-
nology Research Institute, Taiwan.
The cathode electrode contained 63wt% LiMn2O4, 25wt% KS6
(Timcal), 5wt% Super P (Timcal) and 7wt% polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
(PVdF, Aldrich),while the anode contained 93wt%MnFe2O4@C and
7wt% PVdF. Both electrodes used Ti foil as current collector, and
the active-layers were prepared by a slurry-casting method using
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP; Mitsubishi Chemical) as solvent. The
electrodes were ﬁnally dried at 120 ◦C in an oven for 6h.

black, as determined from its pure electrode, is ∼5Fg−1, the spe-
ciﬁc capacitance of the MnFe2O4 component is thus estimated to
be ca. 99 F g−1.
The voltammogram of the LiMn2O4 electrode shows two redox
pairs. One pair is located at 0.85V,while the other located at 0.95V.
They correspond to the lithiation and de-lithiation reactions of
LixMn2O4 with 0.5≤ x≤1 and 0≤ x≤0.5, respectively. The poten-
tial difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks is very
small, indicating high reversibility. From Fig. 2a, it can be seen that
this asymmetric systemhas amaximumoperating voltagewindow
of ca. 1.3V.
Fig. 2b shows the potential curves of the cathode at differ-
ent C-rates. (The C-rate is calculated based on the theoretical
speciﬁc capacity of 148mAhg−1 for LiMn2O4.) It was found that
the speciﬁc capacity is 128mAhg−1 at 0.5C rate, and it does not
decreases much, by less than 5%, as the current is increased to
10C rate (1.48Ag−1). The cathode remains capable of delivering
a capacity of 97mAhg−1 at 100C-rate (14.8Ag−1). The coulom-
bic efﬁciencies are all greater than 99%. The contribution to the
overall capacity due to the capacitance of the conductive additives
(0.69mAhg−1 or 2.5 F g−1) is negligible. Fig. 2C shows the galvanos-
tatic charge/discharge voltage curves of a MnFe2O4 symmetric cell
under different current densities. They all show linear correlation
between voltage and discharge time, typical of a capacitor.
3.2. Full-cell characterization
Three full-cells having different anode-to-cathode (A/C) mass
ratios, including those close to 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1, were charac-
terized (Table 1). These cells have the same active-material loading
(g cm−2) on cathodebut varied loadings onanode. For brevity, these

of 1Ag−1).
cells will hereafter be referred to as the 1-1, 2-1, 3-1 and 4-1 cells,
respectively. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests of the full cells
give linear voltage curves (Fig. 3). The inset in Fig. 3 shows an
example of the potential plots of individual electrodes during the
test, conﬁrming the battery and capacitor behaviors for cathode
and anode, respectively, during the full-cell operation.
The power and energy performances among these cells are illus-
trated in two ways. Fig. 4a plots the speciﬁc cell capacitance and
capacity, both based on the total mass of the active-layers (includ-
ingbinder) versus currentdensityandC-rates.As thecathodeside is
likely the limiting electrode for power performance, all the current
data are calculated based on the cathode active-material loading
(the x-axis). The operating speciﬁc capacities for individual elec-
trodes at their lowest tested current rates are listed in Table 1. Data

the resulting composite exhibits very promising performance in
speciﬁc capacitance, power capability and self-discharge behav-
iors.
2. Experimental
Two types of C substrates have been adopted for depositing MnO2, includ-
ing  CB powder (VULCAN X72, Cabot Corp., USA) and CNT (Industrial Technology
Research Institute, Taiwan; conductivity: 80 S cm−1). To produce the oxide, the
following procedures were adopted: The C material was ﬁrst ground and then dis-
persed in a solution of nitrate acid (7 M)  with stirring at 80 ◦C for 2 h. Another
solution containing KMnO4 (0.2 M)  was added into the acid solution drop by
drop. A dark-brownish precipitate was formed in the solution and the purple
color of the solution gradually disappeared. The solution was stirred and heated
for  another 4 h. At the end of sedimentation of the resulting product, the upper
clear portion of the solution was decanted and replaced with de-ionized water.
The  same washing procedure was repeated several times. Finally, the solution
was  ﬁltered and the product was dried at 60 ◦C. The weight ratio of MnO2 to
C  in the composite powder is 63.5:36.5. The composites will, respectively, be
referred to as the MnO2/CNT and MnO2/CB hereafter. For comparison in the self-
discharge test, amorphous MnO2 has also been deposited on CB (referred to as
a-MnO2/CB) by another process where 100 mL  of 0.15 M KMnO4, and 150 mL of

equal to the product of its mass in the composites and the speciﬁc
capacitances determined from pure CNT and CB electrodes. By sub-
tracting these amounts, the speciﬁc capacitance, Cs, of MnO2 spinel
in MnO2/CNT is 309 F g−1 at the scan rate of 2 mV  s−1, while that of
birnessite in MnO2/CB is 229 F g−1.
The power performance of the electrodes was evaluated by
conducting CV analysis on symmetric cells between −0.8 and
0.8 V under increasing voltage scan-rate. Fig. 4a shows the depen-
dence of the speciﬁc capacitance of the oxide as a function of
scan-rate, while selected voltammograms were shown in Fig. 4b.
As shown, the speciﬁc capacitances of both electrodes decreases
with increasing scan-rate, but the MnO2/CNT electrode shows a
markedly greater performance under high-rate conditions than
the MnO2/CB electrode. The former retains a Cs of 221 F g−1 at
500 mV  s−1 (110 A g−1 or 77 mA  cm−2), which corresponds to a spe-
ciﬁc energy of 19.6 Wh  kg−1 at the speciﬁc power of 88.4 kW kg−1
of the oxide, while the latter already exhibited 36% reduction to
140 F g−1 at 200 mV  s−1.
In short, the MnO2 spinel nano-ﬂakes deposited on CNT exhibits
higher speciﬁc capacitance and greater power capability than the
birnessite granules deposited on CB. The difference in speciﬁc
capacitance may  in part be accounted for by the fact that the spinel
nano-ﬂakes have a larger speciﬁc surface area than the birnessite
granules. On the other hand, the outstanding power performance
exhibited by the spinel nano-ﬂakes may  be attributed to two fac-
tors. First, their surfaces are located mainly within either meso-
or macro-pores, and hence the electrolyte diffusion resistance is
reduced. Secondly, the superior electronic conductivity of CNT as
compared with CB helps to reduce the transmission resistance for
current transport.
3.3. Cycling stability
Long-term cycling stability of the composite electrodes was
evaluated by cycling the symmetric cells ﬁrst at 50 mV  s−1 for 5000
cycles and then at 100 mV  s−1 for another 5000 cycles. The capac-
itance of the MnO2/CNT electrode remains very stable throughout
the entire process; it loses less than 4% of the initial capacitance
after 10,000 cycles (Fig. 5). In contrast, the MnO2/CB loses nearly
23%. The good cycling stability of the MnO2/CNT electrode indicates
strong bonding at the spinel oxide/CNT interface.
Subramanian et al. [18] prepared amorphous MnO2/CNT via a
similar process to the present study, and the composite showed
speciﬁc capacitances in the range of 100–200 F g−1, depending on

One common dilemma encountered in designing a supercapacitor electrode is that the speciﬁc capacitance
(Cs) of the active material decreases signiﬁcantly as the active-material loading (mass area−1) increases. As a
result, the geometric capacitance density (GCD; Farad area−1) of the electrode does not scale up linearly but
gradually levels off with increasing loading. For MnO2 supercapacitors, this problem has been solved to a
great extent by introducing a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) binder, namely polyacrylic acid (PAA), to form
composite particles with MnO2. Other than acting as a binder to bound together MnO2 particles, the SAP is
believed to facilitate distribution of electrolyte throughout the active layer owing to its electrolyte-absorbing
and swelling behaviors. The Cs of MnO2 remains almost unchanged as the oxide loading varies over a wide
range (1.5–6.5 mg cm−2) of heavy active-material loading. In addition, putting PAA throughout the entire
active layer helps to magnify the speciﬁc interaction between PAA and MnO2 that is known to enhance the
capacitance of individual MnO2 particles. The success in combining both high Cs and high active-material
loading results in GCD of ca. 1.8–1.4F cm−2 even under very high current densities (ca. 35–260 mA cm−2 or
5–40A g−1-MnO2).

1. Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors,
are promising energy storage devices auxiliary to rechargeable
batteries and fuel cells for meeting high-power demands [1]. For
practical applications of SCs, metal current collector, that supports the
active-material layer, is indispensable for conducting high current
throughput. Because of ﬁnite thickness of the current collector,
typically in the range of 20–30 μm for foil-type current collector, it is
always desirable to increase the geometric capacitance density (GCD),
i.e., capacitance per unit area, of the active layer so as to maximize the
volumetric capacitance density of the entire cell. One way to increase
the GCD is to increase the active-materials loading, i.e., the amount of
active material per unit area, of the electrode. However, one common
dilemma encountered in this approach is that the speciﬁc capacitance
(Cs) of the active material often decreases signiﬁcantly as the loading
increases. As a result, the GCD does not scale up linearly but gradually
levels off with increasing loading. The power performance also goes
down quickly. The reduction is believed to largely arise from limited
access of electrolyte to the surfaces of the active materials. This
phenomenon is particularly well known for MnO2 SCs.
Hydrated manganese oxide, MnO2·nH2O, has drawn much attention
as one promising pseudocapacitive material for SCs [2]; it has the
advantages of high theoretical Cs, environmental-friendly nature and low
cost. Table 1 lists representative literature Cs data [3–15] of the MnO2 SC
electrodes using foil-type current collector. (In view of high-power
application for SCs, only thosemeasuredwith sufﬁcient high voltage scan
rates, in this case ≥20 mV s−1, for the cyclic voltammetry (CV)
measurement were quoted for comparison.) It is clear that the reported
Cs values spread over a verywide range, and it is typically lower for higher
oxide loading of the electrode. This is particularly demonstrated by the
data sets from Refs. [6] and [9], where the Cs is shown to systematically
decrease with increasing MnO2 loading. The geometric capacitance
density in these data has been limited to be lower than 0.21F cm−2.
In this work, it is demonstrated that the long-standing dilemma
mentioned above can be alleviated to a great extent by combining MnO2
particles with a superabsorbent polymer (SAP), in this case polyacrylic
acid (PAA), to form composite powder as the active material via a spray-
drying process. The Cs of MnO2 in these composite particles has been
found to be almost unchanged over awide range of the oxide loading and
less sensitive to current density for thick electrodes. The improvement
may be attributed to the electrolyte-absorbing and swelling behaviors of
the SAP binder, which, other than providing sufﬁcient binding strength to
hold up the structure of the composite particles, facilitates distribution of
electrolyte throughout the active layer. The same beneﬁcial effects can be
applied to other SC systems aswell. Furthermore, putting PAA throughout
the entire active layer magniﬁes the speciﬁc interaction between the

oxide (as well as CB) has not been able to produce the same extent of
improvement.
Fig. 2a shows the typical voltammograms of a composite-particle
symmetric cell. The single-electrode voltammogram measured in a
three-electrode conﬁguration with a Ag/AgCl(aq) reference electrode
is also shown as an inset in the ﬁgure. All the voltammograms show
nearly rectangular proﬁles, indicating nearly ideal capacitor beha-
viors. It is also shown that the voltammogram is almost unchanged,
exhibitingmerely 1.5% reduction in capacitance, after 3000 cycles. The
data indicate that the composite particles are both chemically and
mechanically robust against capacitance fading. The contribution of
the CB component (3.0–3.3F g−1-active material) has been deter-
mined from the CV measurements of pure CB electrode (not shown)
and subtracted from the overall electrode capacitance in order to give
the capacitance due to the MnO2 component.
Fig. 2b compares the speciﬁc capacitanceofMnO2of two sets (A− and
B−) of electrodes. For the A-set electrodes, they were made of the
composite particles and have different active-material loadings, including
1.6, 3.8, and 6.4 mg cm−2 for A1, A2, and A3 electrodes, respectively. On
the other hand, the B-set electrodes are control electrodes (without PAA),
containing 1.1, 3.2 and 6.1 mg cm−2 of MnO2 for B1, B2 and B3,
respectively. First of all, it can be seen that the B-set electrodes suffer
frommuch greater Cs reductionwith increasing oxide loading than the A-
set electrodes. Secondly, for the thicker electrodes, the Cs of the B2 and B3
electrodes decreases much faster with increasing scan rate than those of
theA2andA3electrodes, indicating that the composite activematerial has
superior power performance. At the scan rate of 200 mV s−1, while the
oxide loading increasesnearly 6 folds (from1.1 to6.1 mg cm−2) for theB-
set electrodes, the Cs drops by 60%, and hence the GCD increases by
only ∼2.4 folds. In contrast, the problem with Cs reduction is solved to a
great extent in the composite electrodes. Cs loses only by 2.2–5.4% at
different scan rates as the oxide loading is increased by 4 folds, from1.6 to
6.4 mg cm−2. The GCD essentially scales up linearly with the oxide
loading.
Furthermore, it is noted in Fig. 2b that the speciﬁc capacitances of the
composite powder are consistently nearly two times those of the control
electrodes even at low scan rates. In our previous study [7] on aqueous gel
electrolytes, it was found that using polyacrylate-based polymers, such as
potassium polyacrylate and potassium polyacrylate-co-polyacrylamide,
as gel polymer electrolytes to replace corresponding liquid electrolytes,
the speciﬁc capacitances of MnO2 electrodes of similar oxide loadings
were increased by 30–50% at 20 mV s−1. The enhancement can be
attributed to the strong interaction between the carboxylate groups of the
polymers with the surface Mn ions, and in-situ X-ray absorption near-
edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis conﬁrmed an enlarged variation in
Mn-ion valence upon charging/discharging [7]. Even greater enhance-
ment inCs,N100% (Fig. 2b), and a greater variation inMn-ion valence (not
shown) have been observed for the present composite electrodes. It is
clear that introducing PAA throughout the entire electrode matrix has
magniﬁed the PAA–MnO2 interaction. With the combination of high
speciﬁc capacitance andhigh active-material loading, as shown in Table 1,
the electrode A3 possesses a far higher GCD, reaching 1.78F cm−2 at the
scan rate of 20 mV s−1, than those reported in the literature.
Fig. 2c plots the GCD as a function of equivalent current density, Id.
They are respectively calculated from
GCD = Csmd ð2Þ
and
Id = Csmdυ; ð3Þ
wheremd is the oxide loading (mass area−1) of electrode and υ is the
voltage scan rate. For comparison, the GCD and current density data
calculated using the literature data shown in Table 1 are also plotted.
It is clear that the composite electrodes synthesized in the present
study exhibit far superior energy (i.e., GCD) and power (i.e., Id)
performance. It is noted that, for the B-set electrodes, the GCD quickly
levels off with increasing oxide loading at high current density region.

cathode! Element analysis shows presence of Al on cathode.  
 
ITRI Li4Ti5O12 doped with P, Cr and Mg improve c-rate performance 
 
Synthesis of LiFeFx 
- Fe(NO3) + HF + LiCO3 in solution in water + ethanol or propanol solutions at 0~60 C 
- Basa A JPS (2012)
