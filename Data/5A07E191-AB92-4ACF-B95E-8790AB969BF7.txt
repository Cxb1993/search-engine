Abstract
Evolution of cellular systems in urban
environments results in microcell and macrocell
overlaying architectures with heavy traffic
loading seen around hot spots. To achieve high
spectrum efficiency, serious traffic blocking
problems usually emerge in such architecture if
the network resource is not well managed.
Based on a normal graph framework, we
propose a fully-distributed dynamic channel
assignment algorithm for hierarchical cellular
systems using antenna arrays.  Utilizing the
available mobile station location information, the
proposed algorithm defines soft-information to
reflect the local traffic distribution.  The soft-
information is then iteratively exchanged among
mobile stations and base stations to significantly
increase system capacity.
Keywords: soft-information, graph
framework, overlaying
architectures, location information

With increasing demands for wireless
communication services and with limited
channel bandwidth resource, increasing
spectrum efficiency becomes an important issue.
Higher spectrum efficiency, and thus higher
system capacity, can be achieved through
sectorization, cell splitting, and reuse-factor
reduction while limiting interference to maintain
signal quality.  In addition, one recently
popular technique to dramatically reduce the
cochannel interference (CCI) and to
significantly increase system capacity is to adopt
NSC94-2213-E-238-002-4
from a BS node to an MS node whenever the
MS is detectable to the BS.  These edges
altogether represent a codeword.  Each edge
is associated with a codeword bit, which can be
either one or zero: One means that desired
signals are transmitting through the link between
the corresponding MS and BS; zero means that
the edge is an interference link.  We define
)(iM  as the set of BS nodes that are
connected to MSi  and define )( jB  as the set
of MS nodes which are connected to BSj .
Figure 1. An example network scenario for
dynamic channel assignment.
In other words, each codeword intends to
describe a DCA solution, and we just need to
decide the best codeword according to the
local constraints.  In order to faithfully
describe the network scenario, we have to
impose the local constraints at each node, as
will be described next.

      Fig. 1
3.2  Local Constraints
Let us first start with the local constraints
associated with the MS nodes.  For simplicity
reason, we assume a system with single-rate
data transmission, i.e., an active MS receives
service only from one BS and the service is
restricted to a single channel, either a time slot
or a frequency band depending on the system
multiplexing scheme.  In that case, the
constraint rule for each MS node is to make
sure there is only a single “one” in the
codeword bits among the associated variables
of all the related edges (or codeword bits)
connected to the MS node.  However, this
rule can be easily extended to a multi-channel
system transmitting multi-rate data just by
allowing more ”ones” in the codeword bits.
Now, let us turn to the local constraints
associated with the BS nodes.  We can make
use of the available MS location information to
define a mobile exclusive region (MER) for
each MS.  When an MS is activated, an MER
is defined and is off-limits to the other MSs
served by the same BS.  Note that an MER is
not effective for the MSs served by the other
BSs due to angle selectivity of the MS channels
in a MIMO system.  For a MIMO uplink
scenario, the MER for each MS looks like a
sector with its vertex at the corresponding BS.
The angle span of the sector is inversely
proportional to the angular resolution of the
antenna array at the corresponding BS; the
radius extension of the sector is proportional to
the distance between the corresponding MS
and BS.  By forcing such angle and distance
protections, the MERs can guarantee the quality
NSC94-2213-E-238-002-6
the SI from BSA  to MSc , MSd , and
MSe  in a similar way.  In scenario 2,
)1,,(SI MSbBSA  = 5.0)0,,(SI MSaBSA .
If there are a large number of MSs
connected to a BS, jBS , we can always
further break )(C j  into independent
simpler constraints so that the application
of (2) can always stay very low
complexity.  
Step 3) From MS to BS:
In order to complete an iteration loop,
each MS needs to calculate its output SIs
with 1) the output SIs from its associated
BSs, and 2) its data rate request. If we
assume single rate for simplicity reason,
the SI passed from iMS  to jBS  is easily
acquired.
Step 4) Convergence check:
At the end of each iteration, we calculate
the likelihood of each codeword bit. For
the codeword bit between MS i and BS j ,
it is temporally decided as l if
)1,,(SI)1,,(SI MSiBSjBSjMSi >
(3)           )0,,(SI)0,,(SI MSiBSjBSjMSi
and decided as 0 otherwise.  If all the
temporal decisions meet all the local
constraint rules, then the algorithm is
considered converges.  However, the is
no guarantee that the proposed algorithm
will always converge in any scenario, since
a viable solution may not even exist for
some heavily overloaded systems.
Nevertheless, while staying very low
complexity, the proposed algorithm can
almost always provide a better solution
than the existing DCA algorithm in non-
trivial scenarios, as will be shown next.
?????????
Simulations are conducted to confirm the
performance improvement of the proposed
DCA algorithm.  The criteria for performance
measurement considered here is the system
capacity subject to a pre-determined blocking
rate.  For comparison, we also test some
conventional algorithms: 1) DCA with no
sectoring, 2) DCA with three-sector cells, 3)
DCA with four-sector cells, and 4) space-
division multiple access (SDMA) scheme.
The SDMA scheme employs an adaptive
switched-beam system, where multiple beams
are used to cover the entire coverage area of
each BS and the beam with the strongest signal
power for the desired MS is selected to serve
the MS.  In the simulation, we assume a
single-frequency scenario for simplicity.
However, it can also be easily extended to
multi-frequency scenarios.  Notice that this
frequency band is allowed to be used in
different sectors or beams.  In other word, the
frequency reuse factor for the DCA with no
sectoring, the DCA with three-sector cells, and
the DCA with four-sector cells are 1, 1/3, and
1/4, respectively.  In order to avoid the CIR
measurement, we apply the concept of MER in
all the algorithms to assign channel.  The MER
for the DCA with no sectoring is a circle; the
MER for the DCA with three-sector cells is a
120-degree sector; the MER for the DCA with
four-sector cells is a 90-degree sector; and
angle spans of the MER sectors for the SDMA
scheme and the proposed algorithm depends on
the resolution of the BS antenna array. In the
SDMA and the proposed algorithm, we test
two different angle protections, 30  and 60 .
The simulation scenario, shown in Fig. 3, is a
