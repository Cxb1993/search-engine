with distilled water at 60 °C to remove 
residual Cl– and then dried at 80 °C overnight. 
Finally, the catalysts were heated at either 
120 or 180 °C for 4 h. 
The feeding rate was regulated to very 
slow so the particles can be controlled under 
5 nm. Special care was taken to have uniform 
particle sizes. 
   The catalysts were characterized by XRD, 
TEM, CO chemisorption, and XPS. Some of 
the samples were examined by high resolution 
TEM.  
Catalytic measurements of CO oxidation 
were carried out in a downward, fixed-bed 
continuous-flow, glass-tubular reactor at 
room temperature. A 0.06 g of Au/CeO2 or 
Au/MnO2 catalyst (bulk density = 1.515 
g/cm3) was placed in the reactor, and the 
reactant gas (1 vol% CO in air) was admitted 
into the reactor with a flow rate of 50 ml/min 
for all the experiments. No pretreatment was 
applied before the reaction run. Quantitative 
analysis of CO and CO2 was performed on a 
gas chromatograph (China Chromatography 
8700T) with a thermal conductivity detector 
using argon as the carrier gas. Calibration 
was carried out with a standard gas 
containing known concentration of the 
components. A CO analyzer (Industrial 
Scientific Corp., model T82) was used to 
analyze CO concentration in the effluent 
below 1000 ppm.  
The CO conversion was calculated based on 
the CO consumption as follows:

where [CO]in is the concentration of CO in 
the inlet gas and [CO]out is the concentration 
of CO in the outlet gas. 
四、結果與討論 
The catalysts prepared by DP method can 
have about 3 nm Au particles. The samples 
prepared by photodeposition could have 
smaller Au particles (~ 1.5 nm). The samples 
prepared by NaBH4 reduction had bigger 
particles. The irradiation time and light 
intensity had strong effect on the particle size 
of gold. Increasing the irradiation time (from 
3 to 10 min by 400 W lamp) lead to the 
agglomeration of gold particles (>5 nm), and 
the particles were widely distributed from 1 
nm to 5 nm as shown in Fig. 5.1. Herrmann et 
al. (1988) also reported similar relationship 
between the amount of silver deposited and 
the illumination time, 400 nm of silver 
particles was obtained with longer 
illumination time. However, large particles of 
gold were not observed on the samples 
prepared by the irradiation of 10 W UV lamps. 
In the images of gold catalysts prepared by 10 
W lamps, it can be observed that small gold 
particles were highly dispersed on the rough 
surface of TiO2. HRTEM was therefore used 
to investigate the particle size of Au. Based 
on the several images of HRTEM, more than 
150 particles were counted and the size 
distribution graph was made. Au particles in 
Au/TiO2 catalyst prepared by low power 
source (10 W) were mainly in the range of 
1.5 nm. The gold particles prepared with a 
400 W lamp were greater than those prepared 
with 10 W lamps. The results demonstrated 
that the power of UV lamp should be low to 
have small gold particles. If the power of UV 
light is too high, the photo-deposition rate 
would be too fast to have large gold particles. 
By optimizing suitable power of UV light and 
irradiation time, it can be possible to prepare 
a catalyst with a gold particle size of 1.5 nm 
and uniform particle size distribution. The PD 
method was proved to form uniform 1 nm 
gold particles on the support (Chan et al., 
2005); however, its catalytic activity has not 
been explored. The mean particles size 
increases from 1.7nm to 3.3 nm after 
reaction.  
 The intensities of plasmon bond at 550 
nm increased with gold loading. It can be 
observed that even after reaction, all the 
catalysts have the similar plasmon at 550 nm 
and exhibit the same purple color, but with 
different intensities. The absorbance at 550 
nm corresponds to the presence of metallic 
gold particles. Zanella et al. (2004) reported 
the presence of plasmon bond of metallic gold 
at 400-600 nm and the intensity of the peak 
increased with the pretreatment temperature.
