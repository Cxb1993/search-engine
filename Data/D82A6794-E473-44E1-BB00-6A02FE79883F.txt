ABSTRACT 
When the three-phase com-
mon-voltage-source UPS, that without output 
transformers, are in parallel, and the 
load-sharing control are operating, usually the 
line-voltage amplitude and the line-voltage 
phase angle of each inverter are adjusted indi-
vidually for the load-sharing control, and 
therefore, when the space vector modulation 
technique is used, the zero-sequence circulat-
ing-current will arise. In this paper a simple 
compensation technique is proposed, and the 
propose compensation technique compensates 
the zero-sequence modulation waveforms of 
parallel inverters to identical, therefore the 
circulating-current is reduced, when the load 
sharing control is progressing. The simulation 
results and the experimental results are pro-
posed for confirming the validity of the pro-
posed compensation method.

lating current.

Dual-Modulator Compensation Technique for
Parallel Inverters Using Space-Vector Modulation
Tsung-Po Chen, Member, IEEE
Abstract—In common dc-link parallel-inverter systems, the am-
plitudes and the phase angles of three-phase inverters can be
separately adjusted to control power sharing. However, when the
space-vector modulation technique is used in a parallel-inverter
system without the output transformers, the zero-sequence cir-
culating current will occur. This paper provides detailed analy-
sis of the zero-sequence circulating current and proposes a
novel dual-modulator compensation technique for eliminating the
zero-sequence circulating current caused by power-sharing con-
trol systems. Results obtained from both simulation and exper-
iments confirmed the performance and the effectiveness of the
proposed compensation method.
Index Terms—Circulating current, inverter, parallel, space-
vector modulation.
I. INTRODUCTION
PARALLEL connection techniques for three-phase in-verters can be employed in motor-drive systems, converter
systems, distributed generation systems, and distributed un-
interrupted power systems [1]–[19]. The main benefits of con-
necting the inverters in parallel include flexibility in planning,
economy in design effort, and capacity for expansion. Hence,
parallel-connection techniques have become important research
topics in recent years. The pulsewidth modulation (PWM)
control of parallel inverters can be centralized using approaches
such as the interleaved modulation method [3], [4] to efficiently
suppress the ripple current. However, for those systems that
cannot use centralized control such as the modular-inverter
system, independent PWM control methods are employed
[5]–[8]. The benefits of independent PWM control for parallel-
inverter systems include flexibility in configuration.
In parallel-inverter systems, such as distributed uninterrupted
power systems, or in active power filters [8]–[19], the phase
angle and the amplitude of each three-phase inverter serve
to control the active and the reactive power of the inverter,
respectively. Parallel inverters with the common dc link will
establish a zero-sequence circuit, whose impedances mainly
come from the current-sharing inductors that are in series with
the output lines of inverters. In general, space-vector modula-
tion techniques involve using various amounts of zero-sequence
modulation signals to improve its performance. Nevertheless,
this would cause zero-sequence circulating-current problems in

parallel-inverter systems [5]–[7]. Current approaches to sup-
pression of the zero-sequence circulating current include the
methods for discontinuous space-vector modulation (DPWM)
[5], [6] and the methods for conventional space-vector modu-
lation (SVPWM) [7], [20]–[23]. Some applications that imple-
ment the most well-known SVPWM are discussed in [24]–[30].
When SVPWM is employed, the zero-sequence voltages of
the parallel inverters may vary, thus producing difference in
the zero-sequence voltage and giving rise to a zero-sequence
circulating current. Comparison among various PWM methods
[4], [21]–[23] reveals that SVPWM is superior to sinusoidal
PWM. However, the problem of the circulating current makes
SVPWM unsuitable for parallel inverters [4], [25].
This paper proposes an open-loop method to compensate
the discordant SVPWM zero-sequence modulation waveforms,
which occur in the power-sharing control system of a parallel-
inverter system using SVPWM. However, the proposed dual-
modulator compensation technique will modify the modulation
waveforms of the parallel DPWM inverter system, spoil some
clamped regions of the three-phase modulation waveforms, and
certainly increase switching losses. Thus, the DPWM tech-
niques are not recommended for use in the proposed dual-
modulator system.
The proposed dual-modulator compensation method has the
following advantages.
1) Open-loop compensation requires no stability analysis
and is simple and easy to use.
2) The zero-sequence voltage is directly compensated with-
out the need of a current-control loop.
3) No extra current-detecting device or extra analog-to-
digital converter is required.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the theoretical background of the parallel-inverter
system, including space-vector modulation and the complex
power-sharing control method for parallel-inverter systems.
The zero-sequence circulating current of the parallel-inverter
systems is detailed in Section III, and a dual-modulator com-
pensation method for eliminating the zero-sequence circulating
current is proposed. Section IV presents the results obtained
from simulation and experiments to demonstrate the perfor-
mance of the proposed method. Section V contains the conclu-
sion of this paper.

ulation techniques [20]–[23] are defined in Fig. 1. As can be

selected is 6◦, the impedance of each current-sharing inductor
is 0.05 per unit (p.u.), the total voltage on the current-sharing
inductors is about 0.1 p.u., and the amplitude of the line current
is approximately 1.0 p.u. As shown in Fig. 3(b), when V2
decreases, i.e., the voltage difference increases, by Kirchhoff’s
voltage law, I1 will increase, and the phase lags 90◦. In the
analysis, the maximum voltage difference selected is 0.1 p.u.,
and the amplitude of I1 is 1.0 p.u.
C. Droop Control for Parallel-Inverter System
In the literature, while power-sharing control systems have
been extensively studied [17]–[19], there is only a brief review
of the droop-control method for reference. As mentioned
in the previous section, parallel inverters follow the basic
power-sharing theorem. The concept of droop control for the
parallel-inverter system comes from the well-known power-
sharing control of the parallel-generator system [31]. Every
inverter in the parallel system has its droop line. The droop line
of a large-capacity inverter has a small slope, whereas that of
a small-capacity inverter has a large slope. As shown in Fig. 4,
with the output frequency being constant, when the total active
power sharing changes from PA to PB , droop-line 1 is moved
up, thus increasing its output active power. At the same time,
when droop-line 2 is moved down, the output active power
sharing is decreased. When the droop lines are kept fixed, the
increase in the active load will be shared by the two inverters,
according to the slope of the droop lines. The droop-control

system does not require any communication between inverters
and is, therefore, an independent power-sharing control
method. A review of the recent development in power-sharing
techniques is provided in [19].
D. Zero-Sequence Circulating Current in
Parallel-Inverter System
Fig. 5 displays the carrier-based modulation waveforms of
the SVPWM inverter, where the modulation index is 1.15,
and the frequency is 48 Hz. The zero-sequence modulation
waveform is the triangular waveform plotted in solid line,
and the sinusoidal three-phase fundamental modulation wave-
forms are also plotted in solid lines. The three-phase SVPWM
waveforms, which comprise the three-phase and zero-sequence
modulation waveforms, are plotted in dashed lines. The data
type of the modulation waveforms shown in Fig. 5 is unsigned,
and the span of the carrier is from 0.0 to 1.0.
Fig. 6 shows the parallel-connected three-phase inverter
with a common dc link, where the output current of the
inverters flows into the load bus through the current-sharing
inductors. Normally, the SVPWM modulator cannot inde-
pendently control the three-phase fundamental modulation
waveforms and the zero-sequence modulation waveform. When
the power-sharing control system is working, the zero-sequence
modulation waveforms of the parallel inverters vary with the
fundamental voltages. A zero-sequence circulating current ex-
ists in the zero-sequence path when the complex power sharing
of the inverters is different.

the follower inverters are sent to the dual SVPWM modulator,
and the original zero-sequence modulation waveform of the
follower inverter is replaced by the zero-sequence modulation
waveform of the master inverter. This way, all parallel invert-
ers have identical zero-sequence modulation waveforms, thus
reducing the zero-sequence circulating current. Although the
transmission of voltage commands may add extra burden to
the microprocessors of the master and follower inverters, the
variations in the modulation index and the frequency command
for load-sharing control are small, and, therefore, the commu-
nication load is light.
Equation (10) expresses the zero-sequence voltage of the
master inverter, with (11)–(13) denoting the output voltages of
the master inverter, the three-phase fundamental voltages, and
the zero-sequence voltage, respectively, i.e.,
vcom1 =
∞∑
k=1
A3k,1 cos(3kωt + θ3k,1) (10)
va,1 =A1,1 cos(ωt + θ1,1) + vcom1 (11)
vb,1 =A1,1 cos(ωt + θ1,1 − 2π/3) + vcom1 (12)
vc,1 =A1,1 cos(ωt + θ1,1 + 2π/3) + vcom1. (13)
Fig. 11. Compensated three-phase modulation waveforms: M =1.15×0.35,
f = 60 Hz.
Similarly, (14) expresses the zero-sequence voltage of the
follower inverter, with (15)–(17) denoting the output voltages
of the follower inverter, the fundamental voltage, and the zero-
sequence voltage, respectively, i.e.,
vcom2 =
∞∑
k=1
A3k,2 cos(3kωt + θ3k,2) (14)
va,2 =A1,2 cos(ωt + θ1,2) + vcom2 (15)
vb,2 =A1,2 cos(ωt + θ1,21 − 2π/3) + vcom2 (16)
vc,2 =A1,2 cos(ωt + θ1,2 + 2π/3) + vcom2. (17)
The zero-sequence modulation waveform of the follower in-
verter is removed from the three-phase modulation waveforms.
Instead, a zero-sequence modulation waveform is generated
according to the voltage command of the master inverter and
then injected into the three-phase modulation waveforms of
the follower inverter. The compensated phase voltages, i.e., the
follower inverter’s fundamental voltage plus the zero-sequence
voltage of the master inverter, are given by
v′a,2 = va,2 − vcom2 + vcom1
=A1,2 cos(ωt + θ1,2) + vcom1 (18)
v′b,2 =A1,2 cos(ωt + θ1,2 − 2π/3) + vcom1 (19)
v′c,2 =A1,2 cos(ωt + θ1,2 + 2π/3) + vcom1. (20)
Since the zero-sequence voltage of (14) will not affect the
output voltage, it is, therefore, not necessary for the lower
modulator of Fig. 10 to be an SVPWM modulator. A sinusoidal
PWM modulator, for example, will be acceptable as well.
Fig. 11 shows the modified three-phase modulation wave-
forms of the follower inverter. As can be seen, the peaks
of the three-phase modulation waveforms will rise, and that
may also decrease the linear modulation range of the follower
inverter. The compensated parallel-inverter system can com-
pletely eliminate the zero-sequence circulating current caused
by the power-sharing control system.

the fundamental output voltage amplitude of the compensated
follower inverter decreases by about 1% at M = 1.15476◦ due
to overmodulation. Furthermore, with the decrease in the actual
phase difference when the modulation index exceeds 1.1, the
minimum actual phase difference is 5.5◦ at M = 1.1547, as
shown in Fig. 15(b). Affected by overmodulation, the accuracy
of the fundamental output voltage of both the amplitude and
the phase angle is slightly degraded, and these errors will un-
dermine the performance of the power-sharing control systems.
The zero-sequence voltage sources of the voltage difference
and the phase difference from the power-sharing control system
are determined. The frequency of the circulating current is
triple that of the fundamental output voltage, and the magnitude
of the relevant circulating current is large. To overcome the
above problems, the proposed dual-modulator compensation
method is recommended. On the other hand, the closed-loop
control method in [7] is originally designed for fine-tuning the
undetermined miscellaneous zero-sequence circulating currents
from “different switching frequencies, different power stage
parameters or different switching dead-time.” In addition, such
a circulating current of fundamental frequency constitutes only
a minor part of the zero-sequence circulating current.
