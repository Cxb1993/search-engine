Abstract 
Transition from a motionless conductive state to an onset of convection and then a complex 
nonlinear bifurcation in a three-dimensional partially heated rectangular cavity will be analysed in the 
present study. The dynamic phenomena involved in the investigated nonlinear system include 
pitchfork bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, frequency doublings, secondary Hopf bifurcations, and 
chaotic dynamics. The predicted results will be verified by comparing with the experimental results 
for the equations governing the natural convection of air in a thermally driven cubic cavity, subject to 
the specified temperature difference at two vertically opposing faces. The solutions for the cases 
investigated at the Rayleigh number with values up to are obtained from the divergence-free 
compensated (DFC) solution algorithm and the dispersion-relation-preserving (DRP) method for the 
approximation of convection terms. For exploring three-dimensional vortical details, it is necessary to 
extract their physically meaningful insight from the enormous amount of simulation results. In this 
study, topological theory was employed for a better understanding of the three-dimensional vortical 
flow features in the thermal driven cavity. One of the effective methods which enable exploration of 
kinematics of three-dimensional fluid flows is the topological study of limiting streamlines (or wall 
streamlines).

1. Introduction 
Free convection, which is resulted from the 
buoyancy force when a fluid is heated by different 
means, may strongly affect the product quality in a 
wide variety of material processing industries. One 
typical example is the Rayleigh-Bénard convection, 
which was originated in the famous experiments 
conducted in 1900 by H. Bénard for the 
investigation of free surface fluid heated from 
below in a dish. In the case of transition from 
conduction to convection, a rather regular cellular 
convection cells was observed.  
In 1916, Lord Rayleigh (1916) interpreted the 
phenomena found in Bénard experiments by 
making the Boussinesq assumption along the 
gravitational direction in the derivation of equations 
of motion. He also showed that the convection sets 
in as the dimensionless Rayleigh number exceeds a 
certain critical value. Since this pioneering work, 
there have been numerous studies of this problem; 
see among others Chandrasekhar (1981) and Drazin 
& Reid (1981) for linear theories, and Kirchgässner 
(1975) and Yudovich (1967), and the references 
therein for nonlinear theories. 
According to Elder (1965) and Seki et al. 
(1978), the convective flow in a cubical cavity 
becomes unstable along with the developed 
disturbances. Guckenheimer (1983) and Wiggins 
(1990) have analyzed these 3-D disturbances based 
on the Hopf bifurcation theory to highlight the 
existence of limit cycles. In the literatures it has 
been investigated so far the structure of limit cycles, 
resulting from an externally modulated 
Rayleigh-Bénard system (Ketchamen et al. 2004), 
the nonlinear damping coefficient (Abed and 
Varaiya 1984) and the effect of induction machine 
load (Ajjarapu and Lee 1992). Also, a successive 
transition from the primary convective steady-state 
to the oscillatory motion and, finally, to the chaotic 
motion has been the subject of several recent works 
where . This is followed by applying 
the projection operator to render 
. According to the definition 
of , we will get  and, in turn, 
. The differential operator  is then 
applied to both sides of Eq. (2) to yield 
. 
Since  is a divergence-free vector, we are led to 
get  or  
. 
The intermediate velocity  can be 
therefore calculated from the following fully 
implicit equation along with the prescribed no-slip 
velocity with the pressure term being eliminated 
from the momentum equations 
(4) 
Calculation of the incompressible viscous 
solutions becomes, as a result, much simplified. 
Through the advection step, given by 
, and the diffusion step, 
given by , 
the predicted intermediate velocity solution  
is not necessarily to be divergence-free. 
 
4. Results and Discussion 
4.1 Validation study 
To validate the present analysis code, the 
solutions predicted at ,  and  
in the currently investigated cubic cavity will be 
compared with other available numerical results. 
We present firstly the predicted velocity profiles 
,  and  at central 
plane . The grid-independent velocity 
profiles predicted at  will 
be compared with the numerically predicted 
profiles of Wong & Baker (2002) in Figures 2. 
 
4.2 Flow topology on the solid surface 
We will now provide additional justification 
of the numerical simulation based on the topology 
rule of Hunt et al. (1978) for the solutions on the 
cross-flow plane. Consider an arbitrary cross-flow 
plane  the critical points of different 
topological types shown in Figure 3 can be 
determined. Summing the nodes , saddles , 
half-nodes , and half-saddles , the values of 
, , , and  satisfy the 
topological rule at the cross-flow plane in the 
non-obstacle flow interior:

Another frequency doubling bifurcation, with 
respect to frequency , was observed at 
 with the frequency of 
Hz shown in Figure 5(c). 
Note that frequency  is also commensurate 
with  and  in the sense that . 
Contradictory to the bifurcation with doubling 
period, which is known as one of the three routes 
to chaos, the currently predicted period-halfing 
bifurcation stabilizes the system and leads the 
system to order. We call ,  and are 
ultraharmonics and ultrasubharmonics (Enns & 
Guire 2001). Figure 6 summarizes the predicted 
periodic solutions, plotted together with the limit 
cycles, based on the phase portraits in the 
bifurcation range I, which is

4.3.2 Quasi-periodic bifurcation 
As the value of  was increased to 
, a new class of bifurcations with 
frequency Hz is predicted and plotted 
in Figure 7(a). We are followed by plotting its 
ultraharmonic mode Hz in 
Figure 7(b) at . This 
predicted subharmonic frequency  is 
incommensurate with the harmonic frequency  
and other previously predicted family-I 
frequencies.

5. Conclusions 
Nonlinear natural convective flow in a cubical 
cavity with hot and cold temperatures prescribed at 
two opposing vertical walls was studied in detail. 
Subsequent to the pitchfork bifurcation, which 
breaks symmetry, the increasingly nonlinear 
condition gives rise to the supercritical Hopf 
bifurcation at .

The predicted results include the time-series 
solutions, the power spectra and the phase portraits 
for  to . As  was 
increased beyond , the growth of 3D 
nonlinear effects in the flow could trigger more 
basic frequencies of oscillations to occur. The 
secondary Hopf bifurcation was seen to occur at 
about  and it leads to the 
quasi-periodic motion with the incommensurate 
frequencies. Ultimately, the flow was evolved to 
show the corrugation of the torus and the strange 
attractor. The chaotic motion was then observed at 
.
