1Space-Time Precoder-Equalizer System
Design for Correlated FIR-MIMO Channel
Principal Investigator: Carrson C. Fung
Project Number: NSC-96-2221-E-009-053
Effective Date: August 1, 2007 to October 31, 2008
Abstract
In this project, a SOS-based precoder-assisted blind equalizer for MIMO-OFDM system which can equalize
correlated FIR-MIMO channel at the receiver is proposed. The proposed scheme uses a set of orthogonal precoders
at the transmitter such that the transmitted signal can be colored temporally thereby satisfying the identifiability
condition previously proposed by Hua and Tugnait. The scheme is shown to outperform previously proposed
schemes in terms of BER and computational complexity. Simulation results have shown that the BER performance
is close to that of a least-squares zero-forcing equalizer with perfect channel knowledge.
3computational complexity at the receiver.
In this project, we proposed a new set of precoder to perform direct channel equalization for MIMO-OFDM
systems such that improved BER performance and lower receiver complexity can be achieved compared to that
of [12], even when the spatial correlation exists. In Section II, we will give a description of the system model,
followed by a review of the equalization algorithm in Section III-A. We will then propose a novel precoder
design in Section III-B. Simulation results are given in Section IV followed by the conclusion in Section ??.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a MIMO-OFDM system with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas. Let s
(i)
m, denotes
the complex-valued data symbol transmitted on the mth tone in the th OFDM symbol from the ith antenna
for i = 1, 2, . . . , Nt. Also, let K = M + v denote the overall OFDM symbol length, where M is the size of
the FFT and v is the length of the cyclic prefix. Then the transmitted signal ui[n] can be written as [11]
ui[n] =
∑

g[n− K]
M−1∑
m=0

where g[n] is a rectangular function rect[0,K−1][n] with
rect[T1,T2][n] =
⎧⎨
⎩ 1, n = T1, T1 + 1, . . . , T20, otherwise.
Then the received signal at the kth receive antenna can be written as
xk[n] =
Nt∑
i=1
[∑


+ ηk[n] (1)
where ηk[n], for k = 1, 2, . . . , Nr, is the stationary additive white channel noise at the kth receive antenna and
hk,i[] is the discrete-time impulse response of the channel. Defining
x[n]=[ x1[n] x2[n] · · · xNr [n] ]T ,
u[n]=[ u1[n] u2[n] · · · uNt [n] ]T ,
η[n]=[ η1[n] η2[n] · · · ηNr [n] ]T
as the receive signal vector, transmit signal vector and the channel noise vector, respectively, then (1) can be
written as
x[n] =
∑

Hu[n− ] + η[n] (2)
where [H]k,i = hk,i[] is the Nr ×Nt channel matrix of order q, that is,
H(z) =

with Σvˇ being the square root inverse of the eigenvalue matrix of Rvˇvˇ(0), and Qvˇ being the eigenvector matrix
of Rvˇvˇ(0). Then we can obtain
WRvˇvˇ(0)WH=E
[
Wvˇ[n]vˇH [n]WH
]
=WHHHWH
=INrL (4)
According to (4), the effective channel U = WH is a unitary matrix. Applying W to the received signal vector
xˇ[n], we can obtain
zˇ[n]=Wxˇ[n]
=W [Huˇ[n] + ηˇ[n]]
=Uuˇ[n] + Wηˇ[n] (5)
From (5), we see that U can be equalized by
U−1zˇ[n] = UH zˇ[n] = uˇ[n] + UHWηˇ[n] (6)
From (6), the problem of equalization becomes finding the unitary equalization matrix of U. Defining the
correlation matrices for zˇ[n] and ηˇ[n] as E
[
zˇ[n]zˇH [n + τ ]
]
and E
[
ηˇ[n]ηˇH [n + τ ]
]
, respectively. From (3),
E
[
ηˇ[n]ηˇH [n + τ ]
]
= 0, for τ = 0. Thus, the correlation matrix of zˇ[n] can be written as
Rzˇzˇ(τ) = URuˇuˇ(τ)UH , for τ = 0. (7)
Thus, the equalizer U can be obtained by diagonalizing Rzˇzˇ(τ). According to [12], we can find U that
equalizes frequency-selective channels if the source signal has different spectral energy. In addition, the chance
of eigenvalue degeneracy can also be reduced by performing a joint diagonalization on a set of Rzˇzˇ(τ) with
various τ = 0, i.e.
UHRzˇzˇ(τp)U = diag
(
ρ1(τp), ρ2(τp), . . . , ρNt(L+q)(τp)
)
,
for p = 0 ≤ t ≤ P (8)

(9)
where Oi(m) is a function having only two possible values +1 and −1. Oi(m) can be designed to generate
orthogonality among different precoders by being assigned different shape for different precoders. Ci,τp deter-
mines the magnitude of corresponding cosine term. Distinct values of Ci,τp must be used for various values
of n and p in order to satisfy the distinct power conditions in [8]. The number of cosine term can be decided
arbitrarily by choosing P . Furthermore, different τp is used for different cosine terms with τp = 1, 2, . . .. The
reason for using cosine is because we can completely control how many autocorrelation matrices in {Rzˇzˇ(τp)}
we need in (8) for the joint diagonalization. This can be seen by considering the inverse Fourier transform of

(δ[n + τp] + δ[n− τp]) (10)
Using (10), the time domain signal after IFFT can be written as
uˇ(n) ∗ {1− Ci,τ02 (δ[n + τ0] + δ[n− τ0])}
= uˇ(n)− Ci,τ02 (uˇ[n + τ0] + uˇ[n− τ0])
(11)
where ∗ denotes convolution and P = 1. From (11), it is easy to see that temporal correlation of delay τ0
can be generated. Therefore, only Rzˇzˇ(τ0) will have to be used in the joint diagonalization process at the
receiver. In fact, using the rest of the Rzˇzˇ(τp), ∀p = 0 will not improve the equalization performance. This
will be shown in the simulation results in the next section when we compare equalization performance of our
proposed algorithm using different τp. Besides varying the parameter τp, the parameter P can also be used
to improve performance of the equalizer. This can be achieved by increasing the value of P such that more
temporal correlation is added to the transmitted bitstream. However, as will be seen in Section IV, P cannot
be increased indefinitely because the precoder will introduce too much amplitude variation into the bitstream
which degrades the BER performance, even though a better estimation of U can be obtained.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
A MIMO-OFDM system is simulated to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. In all simulations,
Nt = 2, M = 64, and v = 16. The channels are randomly generated. Two channels were chosen to show the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm. The first one is a 3-tap channel with 4 received antennas, i.e. Nr = 4, with

Figure 3 compares the BER performance of the proposed precoder with the joint diagonalization based
equalizer with a similar system that uses the joint diagonalization based equalizer but without any precoder. A
least-squares (LS) zero-forcing equalizer with perfect channel state information (CSI) is used as benchmark.
For the precoder-equalizer system, the equalizer uses two correlation matrices, Rzˇzˇ(τ1) and Rzˇzˇ(τ2), for joint
diagonalization. The 3-tap channel in (12) was used. Since the input signal s(i)m, is independently distributed,
the result reaffirms the idea that if the diagonal entries of the input signal power spectral density matrix are not
distinct (no precoder is used), then it is not possible to identify and equalize FIR-MIMO channels using SOS
of the received signal.
Figure 4 shows the BER results of the proposed precoder-equalizer system as the number of OFDM symbols
varies for different SNR values. Similar to previous simulations, Rzˇzˇ(τ1) and Rzˇzˇ(τ2) are used for joint
diagonalization. As the figure shows, the BER of the proposed precoder-equalizer system approaches that of
the LS equalizer when the number of symbols increases. This is because as more symbols are used, more
accurate estimation of the correlation matrix can be obtained. Furthermore, at SNR = 18 dB, the proposed
algorithm is able to equalize the channel using only 350 symbols with a BER of about 10−3. Compare to
higher-order statistics techniques such as [1], when the number of symbols needed for equalization is in the
order of 103, only a small amount of latency is incurred in the proposed technique in order to equalize FIR-
MIMO channels.
Figures 5 and 6 compare the BER performance of the proposed precoder-equalizer system with the precoder-
equalizer scheme in [12]. Results using a LS equalizer and an identical system that uses no equalization are also
shown as benchmarks. As seen in the figures, the performance gap between the LS equalizer and the proposed
one remains virtually unchanged as the channel spectrum changes. This shows that the performance of the
proposed scheme is insensitive to various channel responses. This can be explained by observing the equation
of the precoder in (9). Since the precoder is composed of cosine functions, the spectrum of the precoder will
fluctuate periodically in the frequency domain. Since the amplitude of the cosine, Ci,τp , is set to a small value,
even if the minimum value of the cosine term coincides with the spectral null of the channel, this will not
greatly impact the BER. Compared with the precoders in [12], the proposed precoders perform better by at least

As discussed earlier, the parameter P cannot be increased indefinitely in order to enhance equalization
performance at the expense of increase computational complexity. Likewise, P also cannot be made too small
since it will adversely affect the equalization performance. Figure 8 shows the result of the proposed algorithm
when P is allowed to vary from 1 to 5. As seen from the figure, the BER is smallest when P = 2. Therefore,
P cannot be made arbitrary small in order to minimize computational complexity at the receiver, but it also
cannot be made arbitrarily big since it will adversely impact the BER performance since this will induce too
much amplitude variation into the transmitted bitstream.
V. CONCLUSION
A SOS-based precoder-assisted blind equalizer system has been proposed to equalize correlated FIR-MIMO
channels for MIMO-OFDM system. Simulation results have shown that using the proposed precoder cannot
only outperform the precoder proposed in [12] in terms of BER, but also allows the transmitter to dictate which,
and how many, correlation matrices are to be used for equalization at the receiver. This decreases the amount

did not satisfy the Nyquist criteria.  This has tremendous applications, such as sensor networks, channel 
estimation and array signal processing.  I also attended numerous talks on array signal processing, blind source 
separation, brain computer interface, channel estimation, channel equalization, MIMO systems, etc.  
 
Besides attending the talks, plenary sessions and tutorials mentioned above, I was able to meet many 
researchers who work in similar areas as me, where we get to share many thoughts about current research 
problems and possible future research topics.  One interesting topic that is of growing importance in the signal 
processing community is compressive sensing.  I was able to discuss this with Prof. Richard Baranuik from 
Rice University during his tutorial session, in which he shared his thoughts on possible applications using 
theories behind compressive sensing.  I feel this is an area definitely worth investigating in my own research 
group. 
 
 Recommendations 
I strongly recommend my own students to attend this conference as it contains many papers relevant 
to their research.  Since this is the flagship conference for EURASIP, not only will the students 
benefit from the technical content, but they will also be able to meet many people who are working in 
similar research areas.  I have found enhancements in my own research through active discussions 
with many of these experts during and after the conference.  This conference also serves to give 
students more of a global view of what is going around besides the research topics they are working 
on.  This will be extremely useful to Ph.D. students, who will possibly be faculty themselves upon 
graduation, in order to assist them in selecting which research topics others are working on and 
problems that remain to be solved.

The 2008 EUSIPCO (the flagship conference of EURASIP – The European Association for Signal Processing) 
took place at Lausanne, Switzerland from Aug. 25 – 29, 2008.  The conference has a total of 6 tutorials, held 
in two different sessions.  I was able to attend one on Discrete Optimization in Vision and Graphics in which I 
learned about different types of optimization algorithms, such as Flow-based algorithm, discrete optimization 
and convex relaxations.  The other tutorial I attended was on Compressive Sensing, in which I learned about 
how to approximately reconstruct a continuous-time signal from discrete-time even when the sampling process
