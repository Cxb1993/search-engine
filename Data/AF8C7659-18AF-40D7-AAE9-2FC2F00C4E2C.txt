摘要 
二氧化鈦（TiO2）為具有光催化性質之光觸媒，在利用紫外光（UV light）照射下，方
可降解有機污染物；為了將二氧化鈦於可見光下有更多的應用範圍，本研究添加硝酸氨及
硝酸鐵來改質二氧化鈦，利用氮元素及鐵元素植入二氧化鈦表面，縮短二氧化鈦之能隙，
使其於可見光下即可降解有機污染物；而本計畫研究將改質之含氮鐵二氧化鈦（Fe/N-TiO2）
結合粒狀活性碳（Granular Activated Carbon, GAC），使二氧化鈦於實場應用時，可改善不
易回收及容易產生逸散現象之缺點；並利用活性碳與二氧化鈦所產生之協同作用，增加處
理有機污染物之效率，亦可增加可見光觸媒於實場的應用性。 
本研究製備之含氮鐵二氧化鈦有一最佳光催化活性，其製備條件為：氮鐵添加量為 N = 
0.001 mole、Fe = 0.0012 mole，水熱溫度 150℃，反應時間 1 hr，針對偶氮染料（10 mg/L）
於光波長 419 nm，光強度 35 mW/cm2 照射下，其反應速率為 0.56 hr-1，優於未改質之二氧
化鈦，反應速率為 0.0853 hr-1。 
    Fe/N-TiO2-GAC 應用於連續式流體化床可見光光催化系統中，在不同 pH 值之條件下，
此系統於酸性條件下有較好的反應速率，反應速率常數為 k = 0.60 hr-1。在水力停留時間部
分，結果顯示當系統在酸性條件下，其去除效率隨著停留時間愈長，反應效率愈好在光照
強度部分，隨著光照強度的提高，對於偶氮染料（AO7）在光催化反應呈現增大的趨勢。
在不同初始濃度部份，結果顯示其去除效率隨著濃度增加而下降，反應速率常數由 1.74 hr-1
降低至 0.17 hr-1。

ABSTRACT 
The objective of this study is to synthesize nano-particle titanium dioxide catalyst using 
Sol-gel/Hydrothermal process. In our research, doping of nitrogen in TiO2 enhances 
photoresponse in visible light region and doping of Fe
3+
 reduces the recombination of electrons 
and holes. Both of the above effects are beneficial for improving the performances of Fe/N-TiO2 
photocatalyst. Besides, the photocatalytic oxidation of acid dye (Acid orange 7) in visible light 
(419 nm) irradiation was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor. Fe/N-TiO2-granular activated 
carbon was employed as the photocatalysts, and the lamp was used as the light source.  
The photocatalytic oxidation of acid dye (Acid orange 7) in visible light (419 nm) irradiation 
was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor. It can be seen that maximum removal percent of AO7 
is 95% at pH =3 and C0 = 100 mg/L and the minimum one is 60% at pH = 3 and C0 = 200 mg/L. 
The pseudo-first-order rate constant kobs for acid orange 7 was enhanced with increase of light 
intensity and HRT. The highest kobs was 0.60 hr
-1
 at pH = 3, HRT = 10 hr and light intensity = 35

粉末；並利用水熱法，以不鏽鋼鍋之密閉空間，以低溫的方式產生壓力，避免以高溫對二氧
化鈦之本身晶相產生改變。 
現今有許多學者以溶膠凝膠法、水熱法、熱水解法來合成複合型二氧化鈦，其合成元素
包括了過渡金屬元素（Zn、Fe、Pd、Mo、Cr）[2-6]以及非金屬元素（N、S、C）[7-10]。Ye
等人於 2005 年[11]利用溶膠-凝膠法進行 TiO2 合成，其添加元素包括了 Cr3+、Fe3+、V4+
等過渡金屬，以及非金屬元素 N 的摻雜，可將激發光偏移至可見光區，並以波長 470nm 的
LED 光源進行水楊酸光催化降解，其光催化效果與未改質之商業用二氧化鈦（Degussa P-25）
相比較，其光催化活性皆優於 Degussa P-25。 
在光催化反應器的部分，由於流體化床技術目前在環境工程方面廣泛的應用於廢棄物焚
化減量、廢氣及廢水等汙染物處理，此技術在環保範疇的重要性與普遍性日漸增加。Wong
等人及 Patel 等人於 2006 年皆應用流體化床技術去除水中之污染物，說明了流體化床技術可
以增加其污染物之去除效率[8, 12]，其原理為利用液體垂直通過填充所形成之顆粒床，主要
目的在於使固體顆粒與流體間能有充分之接觸，以便於進行熱傳、質傳或化學反應。 
因此本計劃研究利用溶膠凝膠法及水熱法兩部分來製備含氮、鐵二氧化鈦，期望藉由溶膠凝
膠法製備均勻性高及產物品質佳等優點，再結合水熱法的密閉操作空間，確保粉體的均勻
度，亦可避免粉體遭到其他物質污染。故本實驗利用 Mi 等人於 2008 年[13]以溶膠凝膠法製
備含氮、鐵二氧化鈦，利用其最佳改質參數，硝酸銨（0.001 mole）及硝酸鐵（0.0012 mole）
之添加比例，作為本實驗之氮、鐵來源，結合粒狀活性碳並應用於光催化流體化床進行光催
化試驗，增加處理有機污染物之效率，亦增加可見光觸媒於實場之應用性。 
 
四、 研究方法 
1. 含氮、鐵二氧化鈦改質方法 
        溶膠凝膠部份為取四丁基氧化鈦（0.1 mole）與定量之無水酒精（100 ml），緩慢
的將四丁基氧化鈦滴入無水酒精中，並攪拌至均勻可獲得溶液 B。將硝酸銨（0.001 mole）
及硝酸鐵（0.0012 mole）溶於去離子水中，並加入 10ml 之冰醋酸，並充分攪拌後可獲得溶
液 A。將溶液 B 緩慢滴入溶液 A 並攪拌 48hr，即完成溶膠凝膠部份。 
    水熱法部分即為將攪拌 48 小時過後的膠體溶液，置入於高溫反應容器中，並施以設定
之時間及溫度進行反應。待冷卻後，取出樣品以 80℃烘乾 12 小時，再以 300℃與以加熱 1
小時使其形成二氧化鈦結晶，最後經由研磨可得到含氮、鐵二氧化鈦粉末。 
2. 連續式流體化床光催化反應 
    本實驗所使用之連續式流體化床為一圓柱形體，其內徑為 3 cm，外徑 4 cm，高為 50 
cm，並以兩台蠕動幫浦分別控制其水力停留時間（HRT）及流體化程度，使反應器內部成

（2）ESCA 表面元素分析 
   以化學電子光譜分析儀（ESCA）偵測 Fe/N-TiO2 表面元素之化學組態。圖 4 中 Fe/N-TiO2
之製備條件為氮鐵摻雜比例 0.001：0.0012 mole、水熱溫度 150 ℃、反應 1 小時；而 TiO2
則為未添加氮鐵元素，並以相同水熱溫度反應 1 小時。於 Fe/N-TiO2 之 ESCA 全能譜圖中，
發現 Ti(2p) 及 O(1s) 的訊號相當明顯，束縛能約於 458.3 eV、529.6 eV，同時也觀察到 N(1s) 
及 Fe(2p) 之訊號，束縛能約於 400 eV 及 710.4 eV，而在未摻雜氮鐵元素之 TiO2 僅有 Ti 及
O 的訊號出現，經由計算可以發現當 N(1s) 訊號產生時，O(1s) 訊號會相對減弱，而有 Fe(2p) 
訊號產生時，Ti(2p) 訊號亦會相對減弱，可判定 TiO2 的中有部分 O 及 Ti 與 N 及 Fe 發生
置換，代表著本研究，以硝酸銨及硝酸鐵分別作為氮及鐵的來源，利用溶膠凝膠/水熱法製
備含氮鐵二氧化鈦為可行之方式。

應；當連續式流體化床系統之 pH = 7、10 時，其水力停留時間由 2.5 hr 增加至 5 hr 時，其

六、 結論 
1. Fe/N-TiO2物性分析 
（1） 本研究利用溶膠凝膠/水熱法製備含氮鐵二氧化鈦，於能隙變化評估部分，其製備
之 Fe/N-TiO2 皆位移至可見光區（427 nm ~ 485 nm），其能隙亦有顯著變化，由 3.2eV
縮小至 2.58 eV。 
（2） 在晶相組成分析部份，以 X 光繞射儀（XRD）可發現由溶膠凝膠/水熱法所製備之
Fe/N-TiO2 晶相皆由 Anatase phase 組成（100 %），其原因為於溶膠凝膠脂實驗過程，
採用弱酸介質（CH3COOH），故所製成之晶相主要為 Anatase phase。 
（3） 本研究以溶膠凝膠/水熱法，以硝酸銨及硝酸鐵為氮鐵之來源，改變不同添加量及
不同水熱溫度製備 Fe/N-TiO2，以 ESCA 表面元素分析 Fe/N-TiO2 表面氮鐵摻雜量之
變化，其結果顯示隨著氮鐵添加量增加其氮鐵摻雜量亦隨之上升，而當水熱溫度上
升，其摻雜量亦隨之上升；操作參數在 0.002/0.0024-200℃時，有最高之氮鐵摻雜
量，其分別為 5.58 % 及 5.48 %。 
2. 批次式 Fe/N-TiO2 處理偶氮染料試驗 
（1） 本研究利用溶膠凝膠/水熱法製備 Fe/N-TiO2，利用批次光催化反應進行光活性測
試，其最佳改質參數為，氮鐵添加量之 molar ratio ＝ 0.001：0.0012，以水熱法 150℃
反應 1 小時，有最佳之光催化效果。 
（2） 能隙變化對於光活性影響方面，本研究製備之 Fe/N-TiO2 能隙可縮小至 2.58 eV，但
其偶氮染料之光催化降解效果並不隨著能隙縮小而增加，當能隙為 2.87 eV 時，其
偶氮染料之光催化降解效果最佳。 
（3） 比表面積分析中，當增加氮鐵添加量時，鐵元素摻雜於二氧化鈦表面時，會造成二
氧化鈦產生凝聚現象，而造成比表面積亦隨之上升；而比表面積對於光催化反應之
影響為當比表面積較大時，光催化活性隨之上升，比表面積較小時，其光催化活性
相對下降趨勢。 
（4） 在 ESCA 表面元素分析中，操作參數在 0.002/0.0024-200℃時，有最高之氮鐵摻雜
量，但在光催化活性測試部份並沒有隨著氮鐵摻雜量的增加而增加，反而在製備條
件 0.001/0.0012-150℃，有一最佳光催化活性。亦代表著並不是一昧的增加 TiO2表
面之氮鐵摻雜量，當 TiO2 表面氮及鐵元素摻雜過量，易導致電子電洞對之再結合，
進而影響光催化活性。 
3. Fe/N-TiO2-GAC 應用連續式流體化床處理偶氮染料試驗 
（1） Fe/N-TiO2-GAC 於流體化床管柱中為擬一階反應，反應速率隨著 pH 值及水力停留
時間改變而有不同處理速率；針對 pH 值對系統之影響部分，其系統於酸性條件下，
隨著水力停留時間（HRT）的增加，對於偶氮染料（AO7）有較佳的降解效率，而
去除效率隨著 pH 值的上升而降低，去除效率為 85%，反應速率常數為 0.6 hr-1。 
（2） 在不同光照強度部份，當系統隨著光照強度由 8.75 mW/cm2 提高至 35 mW/cm2 時，
其對於偶氮染料之去除效率亦隨之上升。 
（3） 隨著偶氮染料（AO7）濃度的增加，到達光觸媒表面的光照強度已隨之減少，故當

一、參加會議經過 
 
The article titled “Catalytic Reduction of NOx and Unburned Carbon From Flue Gas By 
Packed Bed α-Fe2O3 Process” and “Ferric Catalyst De-NOx Processes by Utilization of 
Carbon Monoxide from Vehicle Exhaust” were presented in the A&WMA’s 102nd 
ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION (06/16/2009-06/19/2009) in COBO Center, 
Detroit, Michigan. (please see the attached)  
 
The Air & Waste Management Association (A&WMA) is a professional organization 
that enhances knowledge and expertise by providing a neutral forum, and outreach to 
more than 8000 environmental professionals in 65 countries. In the four day conference, 
the topic covers all aspects of the air and waste management, including chemistry of the 
atmosphere, ambient monitoring, health and environmental effects of air toxics, risk 
assessment and management, pollution prevention, climate change strategies, 
management and treatment of hazardous, and municipal waste treatment. Discussed 
subjects includes laboratory, pilot-scale and full-scale case studies as well as modeling 
studies. Moreover, the Association also sponsors between 6 and 10 specialty conferences 
a year, including the topics such as global climate change, emission inventories and 
measurements of toxic and related air pollutants; workshops on a range of environmental 
issues. 
 
二、與會心得  
 
Latest air and waste pollution management technology has been discussed in this 
conference. In the four-day conference, the topic covers all aspects for the management of 
air and waste pollution, including the prevention, reduction and reuse methods. 
Furthermore, over 60% of the articles are sustainability related issue. It tells us two things:

does increase the removal of NOx in this burning facility. Li et al7 also reported that CO removal at 
temperatures of 350℃ using Fe2O3 in the oxygen–rich environment. Fe2O3 is a porous material, which is a 
common catalyst in many chemical processes, and can remove CO up to 90 % in above experimental 
condition. Chen et al.11 studied the effects of temperature and empty bed contact time (EBCT) for ZVI/NO 
reaction in a packed bed column process. For six controlled temperatures of 573 K-773 K and 400 ppm of 
NO influent concentration for EBCT of 0.0225 sec to 0.0679 sec, NO was completely removed. Moreover, 
the amounts of NO reduction (as mg NO /g ZVI) increased as temperature increased. Another research done 
by Hayhurst and Lawrence3 studied the difference between ZVIR and iron oxide for NOx removal, and 
showed iron oxide was useless for NO and N2O, but ZVIR can remove both pollutants up to 80 %. They 
also mentioned that the final products after ZVIR/NOx reaction would be Fe2O3 for NO removal, and FeO 
for NO2 removal but no chemical analysis to support their conclusions in their paper. Furthermore, the 
presence of CO can be utilized to react with iron oxide to act as reducing agent to regenerate iron shown in 
Equations (1)-(4).

The addition of carbon could be oxidized to form CO by O2. CO is a stable source to supply reducing gas for 
α-Fe2O3 to remove NO. Consequently, this present technique is directly using oxidizing carbon in the 
exhaust gas for NO reduction. In addition, not only simultaneous removal of NO and carbon could be 
reached, but the convenience and less cost of pollution controlled equipment operation also could be 
achieved. Therefore, the purposes of this research are to identify the reaction among α-Fe2O3/NO/C for the 
followings: (1) Effects of operating temperatures, especially the typical temperatures for the flue gas, (2) 
Effects of weight on NO reduction and breakthrough time, (3) Identification crystal structures of the 
reactedα-Fe2O3 by XRD and determination of reaction mechanisms among NO/O2/C/α-Fe2O3. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
The experimental setup was shown in Figure 1. Pure N2 gas was used to dilute the NO to the desired 
concentration (240-960 ppm) by mass flow control (MFC) equipment. A dynamic dilution system was used 
to control the concentration into the heated quartz column filled with 45 μm α-Fe2O3 (manufactured by 
RDH chemical Inc.) with BET measured surface area of 0.183m2/g. Activated carbon (C) powder (diameter: 
590 μm  φ  840 μm) is CA≦ ≦ -104 NII/OV manufactured by SHIGEMATSU WORKS Co. The column 
was heated by an electrothermal heating system with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) temperature 
controller to maintain the desired temperature to less than 2 % error. The fluidized column is designed with 
longer narrow tube with diameter 0.8 cm. The influent NO concentration was controlled around 240 ppm to 
simulate the flue gas concentration out of stationary combustion source. The influent and effluent gases 
were monitored by CEMS (Continuous Emissions Monitoring System) which connected to a data collector 
to store the experimental results. The CEMS is a Modular System S710 manufactured by SICK MAIHAK 
AG, German, and is capable of analyzing NO continuously. Crystal structures of the reacted ZVI species 
were analyzed by XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), a DMAX 2200 VK type manufactured by Rigaku Co. in Japan. 
Before operation, 30 minutes of system preheat were used and nitrogen gas purging was continuous to 
maintain the iron surface activity.  
 
Four different parameters: temperature (623K, 673K, 723K and 773 K), NO influent concentration (240, 
480, 720, 960 ppm), oxygen content (3%, 6%, 9% and 12%) andα-Fe2O3/Carbom dosage (0.5g, 0.75g and 
1.0g) were tested in packed bed α-Fe2O3 column studies. Breakthrough time for NO were determined based 
on 80 % reduction of the initial concentration passing through. Therefore, amounts of NO reductions (as mg 
NO) were determined based on the area above the breakthrough point from equation (5) derived from the 
ideal gas law, where b.t. is the breakthrough time, Cin is the influent concentration and Cout is the effluent 
concentration, Q is the flowrate and MW is the molecular weight of NO:

ppm,α-Fe2O3 /C= 3.0g/2.0g, Flowerate= 300 mL/min, O2= 3%. 
 
The influent NO concentration was controlled around 240ppm to simulate the concentration from the flue 
gas. Figure 3 presents the NO removed (commonly 50ppm of the effluent NO concentration) by α-Fe2O3 
together with addition of carbon versus the three working temperatures. The results show that when the 
temperature was increased, the amount of NO removed per gram of α-Fe2O3 was increased, and linearity 
was found from 673 K to 773 K from the equation of Q = 0.0327 (Temp)+1.8079 with R2 of 0.9507 where 
Q is the amount of NO removed per gram of α-Fe2O3. The lowest reaction temperature can be determined 
when Q is input as zero and is calculated as 673K according to this equation. Moreover, kinetic wise, rate 
constant should be higher for higher temperature based on Arrhenius equation, but is not discussed here 
since the reaction was so fast that the NO was completely removed. One can increase the NO concentration 
or reduce the breakthrough time to achieve rate constant if needed.

Effects of Weight of α-Fe2O3 (W)/Carbon(C)  
Figure 6 presents the controlledα-Fe2O3 dosages of 0.1 g-3.0 g at same influent NO concentration of 
240ppm. The experiment started with α-Fe2O3 dosages of 0.1 g, 90.75% of NO was removed. When 
theα-Fe2O3 dosages increased to 0.5g, 100 % removal was achieved, the mass reduction and breakthrough 
time of NO were all linearly proportional to the α-Fe2O3 dosage, but NO removed (as mg NO) were also 
constant. Combining the above results, NO removed (as mg NO) were constant (5.31 mg NO averagely) 
regardless ofα-Fe2O3 dosage. Linearites can be seen for the line with correlation coefficients (R2) greater 
than 0.92. The result shows from 0 g to 0.5 g from the equation of Q = 5.643 (α-Fe2O3 Dosage)-2.955 with 
R2 of 0.92.  
 
Figure 7 presents the effluent NO concentrations at four different carbon dosages of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 g at 
sameα-Fe2O3 dosage of 3.0 g, using temperatures of 773 K as examples. Complete removals were achieved 
for these breakthrough times since the reaction kinetic was so fast. The breakthrough time for the higher 
carbon dosages (2.0 g) was about 20.1 % larger than that of the lower carbon dosages (0.5 g) for the same 
temperature of 773K. The time of CO produced was affected by carbon dosage. However, more addition of 
carbon produced more CO. The results show that when the carbon dosage was increased, the amount of NO 
removed per gram ofα-Fe2O3 was increased.

Determination of reaction mechanism  
In order to determine the reaction mechanism among α-Fe2O3, carbon, O2 and NO, X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
was conducted to analyze the crystal structure of the reacted α-Fe2O3 for α-Fe2O3, carbon, NO, O2 from 
previous experimental condition (Temperature 773K, α-Fe2O3/carbon dosage of 0.5 g/0.5 g, same flux of 
0.6 mL/min.cm2). Since the reaction is a heterogeneous reaction which only occurred on the ZVI surface 
instead of bulk of the ZVI(Hayhurst and Lawrence, 1997; Hayhurst and Ninomiya, 1998), the reacted 
α-Fe2O3 remained on the surface can be used for characteristic identification to understand its byproduct 
and the reaction mechanism. According to Hayhurst & Ninomiya(Hayhurst and Ninomiya, 1998), the 
byproducts of ZVI could be either FeO, Fe3O4 or Fe2O3. FeO is the predicted remaining iron oxide 
according to a model based on a shrinking core of iron surrounded by an outside layer of oxide, but it was 
risky without any chemical identification. XRD was used for identifying the species, and the XRD spectra 
were shown in Figure 10. In addition to the highest peak (α-Fe2O3), the rests were determined as Fe2O3, 
δ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3.

SUMMARY 
In this study, temperature, NO influent concentration, oxygen content and α-Fe2O3 /carbon dosage as well 
as the fate of ZVI were determined for the chemical reaction betweenα-Fe2O3 /carbon and NO. For five 
controlled temperatures of 523 K-773 K and 240 ppm of NO, NO was completely removed for temperature 
of 623 K-773 K, but was not removed at all for 523 K. The addition of carbon also plays an important role. 
When iron powder quantity was fixed and the carbon powder quantity increased, capacity ofα-Fe2O3 (as 
mg NO) was proportionally increased as the carbon quantity increased. In addition, the increase of oxygen 
concentration decreased the efficiency for NOx removal. Under the environment of high-temperature and 
low oxygen, carbon gasification provided the reducing agent CO to assist the reduction of NOx. Moreover, 
unburned carbon from flue gas was oxidized to produce CO in higher temperature and O2 condition. CO is 
a good reducing gas for α-Fe2O3 catalyst to remove NO. X-Ray powder diffraction was conducted to 
analyze the crystal structure and oxidation state of the reacted powders. Several species were determined 
from the spectrum: Fe2O3, δ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3. Combining the results from XRD, the mechanisms for 
α-Fe2O3 /carbon and NO to simulate the presence of fugitive carbon can be proposed as the following 
consecutive reactions:

ABSTRACT 
In this study, two iron oxide catalysts (α-Fe2O3, φ 45 μm and FeOOH, manufactured in the laboratory) ≦
were utilized to evaluate carbon monoxide, emitted by engine exhaust with NOx simultaneously, as a 
reductant for de-NOx process by packed bed reactor. Four reaction parameters were adopted: reaction 
temperature, NO influent concentration, CO influent concentration and α-Fe2O3 / FeOOH dosage. Possible 
reaction steps were investigated by XRD spectrum. 
In α-Fe2O3 catalyst system, effective temperature was 673~773 K and NO removal efficiencies were 81~95 
% for NO influent 240~720 ppmv and CO influent 1910 ppmv, respectively. NO removal of 4 % was 
observed for CO concentration 955 ppmv, but was increased to 95 % for CO concentration 1910 ppmv in 
773 K and stayed 95 % NO removal for CO influent up to 3820 ppmv. It was showed molar removal ratio 
RNO/RCO was linearly correlated to influent concentration ratio [NO]in/ [CO]in due to reduction of NO and 
oxidation of CO were simultaneously occurred. α-Fe2O3 dosage also affected NO removal efficiency, 
where α-Fe2O3 dosage was controlled above 2.g for 95 % NO removed at 240 ppmv in 773 K.  
In FeOOH catalyst system, effective reaction temperature was 523 K~723 K for over 98 % NO removed 
with NO influent 720 ppmv and CO influent 1910 ppmv. Lower CO influent concentration 478 and 955 
ppmv decreased NO removal efficiency to 0 and 44.6 % in 523 K due to lack of sufficient activated iron 
sites provided by CO / FeOOH reaction. It was observed as CO influent 1910 ~2980 ppmv, the CO reacted 
efficiency was decreased, and NO removal efficiency was still kept in 100 % due to CO / FeOOH reaction 
provide stably reduction reaction for NO to convert to N2. 
Moreover, XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) was used for demonstration of catalytic reactions among CO, NO, 
α-Fe2O3, and FeOOH.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
The exhausts of vehicle comprise of NOx, CO2, CO, HC. NOx emission from vehicles is demonstrated as 
the precursor to both tropospheric ozone and acid rain in urban area. However, there are limits to reduce 
emissions solely by improving engines; therefore, after-treatment devices are demanded for more NOx 
reduction in recent years. There are three types of catalyst be used presently, comprise of 1) precious metal, 
2) metallic oxide, 3) transition metal. Such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), widely used in stationary 
sources, but is not a convenient technique in automobile systems since urea addition is not possible.  
 
CO is a strong reducing agent and is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing compounds, 
notably in internal-combustion engines. α-Fe2O3 is ordinary as catalyst for chemical process which is 
attributed to its good porosity of surface. NO can be catalytically reduced by CO over α-Fe2O3 surface in a 
fluidized-bed combustor has been reported in literature [1]. The performance for catalyst is influenced by 
some factors, such as reaction temperature, time, and catalyst’s properties (particle size, surface area). 
There is a report in literature that employed α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as an oxidant to oxidize carbon 
monoxide at 350 °C of the operation temperature in the presence of oxygen, and derived significant amount 
of CO it can remove through the catalytic oxidation, and the CO conversion rates were higher than 90 % [2]. 
It is demonstrated with higher activity of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles than non-nano α-Fe2O3 powders that was 
attributed to small particle size and its high surface area; it could potentially provide significantly improved 
catalytic performance over non-nano catalysts.   
 
α-Fe2O3 could also catalyze reduction of NOx that was demonstrated in a combustion system, which 
employed α-Fe2O3 powder coinjection both with the main fuel and reburning fuel into a 300-kW Boiler 
Simulator Facility, and improved NOx reduction by about 20 % [3]. In the catalytic procedure that NO 
Reduction and CO Oxidation could self-stimulate by α-Fe2O3 simultaneously. An initial CO or NO

CO reacted with Fe2O3 to form to CO2, in this study also employed five different reaction temperatures (623 
K, 648 K, 673 K, 723 K, and 773 K) to evaluate the reacted efficiencies of CO for the gas flow rate Q25°C 
300 mL /min at 25 °C, the weight of α-Fe2O3 3 g, NO influent 240 ppmv, and CO influent 1910 ppmv, 
respectively. By the experimental results showed the reaction temperatures 623~648 K and CO reacted 
efficiencies were 19~25 % for NO influent 240 ppmv and CO influent 1910 ppmv. Subsequently the 
experimental results showed the reaction temperatures 673~773 K and CO reacted efficiencies were 40~55 
%. The results revealed the reaction temperature above 673 K had the better reacted efficiency for CO. The 
CO reacted efficiencies and reaction temperature were shown in Fig. 4.

α-Fe2O3 dosage also affected NO removal efficiency. there were four different α-Fe2O3 dosage employed to 
evaluate the NO removal efficiencies in 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 ppmv for 773 K, the gas flow rate Q25°C 300 
mL /min at 25 °C, NO influent 240 ppmv, and CO influent 1910 ppmv, respectively. The experimental 
results were shown in Table. 3. According to the experimental results, CO reacted efficiency were increased 
from 27.6 % to 55.39 % and NO removal efficiency were increased from 58.61 % to 95.87 % with α-Fe2O3 
dosage from 0.5 g to 3.0 g, respectively. Also the CO molar removal efficiency RCO were increased from 
5.48 mmol.s-1 to 9.41 mmol.s-1 and NO molar removal efficiency RNO were increased from 1.21 mmol.s-1 
to 2.05 mmol.s-1, respectively. Although NO removal efficiency had achieved above 95 % in α-Fe2O3 
dosage 2.0 g and 3.0 g, respectively. However, CO reacted efficiency was 55.39 % > 53.23 % in α-Fe2O3 
dosage 3.0 g and 2.0 g. 
 
Possible reaction steps for NO, CO, and α-Fe2O3 were investigated by X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD) 
spectrum. In order to confirm the crystal structure of catalytic products, the analyzed results as compared 
with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) spectrum. Fig. 9. showed the analyzed

According above experimental results, the optimum reaction temperature is above 573 K for FeOOH 
catalyst system. Therefore, there were five different NO concentrations employed to evaluate the NO 
removal efficiencies in 240, 480, 720, 960, and 1200 ppmv for 573 K, the gas flow rate Q25°C 300 mL /min 
at 25 °C, the weight of FeOOH 3 g, and CO influent 1910 ppmv, respectively. The experimental results 
showed NO influent concentration 240~720 ppmv, the NO removal efficiencies were above 98 %. 
Nevertheless, when the influent NO concentration were more than 720 ppmv, the NO removal efficiencies 
were decreased gradually. And the NO concentration increased to 1200 ppmv the NO removal efficiency 
was down to 82 %. As for CO reacted efficiency, when NO concentration from 240 to 720 ppmv, the CO 
reacted efficiency was from 49 % up to 70 %. And when the NO concentration was 960 ppmv, the CO 
reacted efficiency was 65 %, but when the NO concentration was 1200 ppmv, the CO reacted efficiency 
was 72 %. Therefore, the optimum operation NO concentration was 720 ppmv. The experimental results 
were shown in Fig. 11. 
 
CO concentration also evaluated as below. Therefore, there were five different CO concentrations 
employed to evaluate the NO removal efficiencies in 478, 955, 1910, 2865, and 3820 ppmv for operation 
temperature 523 K, the gas flow rate Q25°C 300 mL /min at 25 °C, the weight of FeOOH 3 g, and NO 
influent 720 ppmv, respectively. The experimental results showed as CO influent concentration 955 ppmv, 
the NO removal efficiency just only 44.6 % and the CO reacted efficiency was 83 %. Then as CO influent 
concentration increased to 1910 ppmv, the NO removal efficiency increased to 100 % and the CO reacted 
efficiency was decreased to 70 %. And the NO removal efficiency still kept in 100 % as CO influent 
concentration increased to 2865 and 3820 ppmv, respectively. The results revealed after CO influent 
concentration had achieved 1910 ppmv, NO removal efficiency can not increase more due to CO / FeOOH 
reaction provide stably reduction reaction for NO to convert to N2. The experimental results were shown in 
Fig. 12. 
 
FeOOH dosage also affected NO removal efficiency. there were four different FeOOH dosage employed to 
evaluate the NO removal efficiencies and CO reacted efficiencies in 2, 3, 4, and 5 ppmv for 523 K, the gas 
flow rate Q25°C 300 mL /min at 25 °C, NO influent 720 ppmv, and CO influent 1910 ppmv, respectively. 
The NO removal efficiencies were all achieved 100 % in five different FeOOH dosages. However, CO 
reacted efficiencies above 87 % since 4 g FeOOH dosage. The experimental results were shown in Table. 5. 
 
XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) was also conducted to analyze the crystal structure and oxidation state of the raw 
and reacted FeOOH. It was demonstrated that carbon monoxide reduced Fe3+ ion of FeOOH to Fe2+ and 
nitric oxide oxidized Fe2+ back to Fe3+ ion, indicating FeOOH is a catalyst in the reaction. Fig. 13. showed 
the XRD analysis results for FeOOH reacted with CO/ NO. There were four compounds had found in 
FeOOH catalyst system, which were FeOOH, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and Fe2FeO4 in reaction temperature 523 K.

SUMMARY 
Initially, in the α-Fe2O3 catalyst system the NO removal efficiency was lower but increased with the 
cumulative amount of reduced α-Fe2O3 by CO. Which CO adsorbed on the α-Fe2O3 weakens one of the 
Fe-O bonds to create a loosely attached O site. A subsequent CO gets oxidized by this O and transforms the 
Fe2O3 to a reduced Fe2O2, and then reduces NO via multiple oxidation and reduction steps that return the 
Fe2O2 to the oxidized Fe2O3. It is demonstrated that Fe2O3 can oxidize CO to form CO2 and reduce NO to 
form N2 by undergoing compositional changes between Fe2O2 and Fe2O3 states. The α-Fe2O3 catalyst 
systems for the utilization of CO, and reaction temperature showed a linear relationship. There was a linear 
relationship for NO removal efficiency with the reaction temperature at only 623-673 K and NO removal 
efficiency had been maintained at 80-95 %. The NO removal efficiency was 4.45 % at CO influent 
concentration 955 ppmv, but when the CO influent concentration increased to 1910 ppmv, the NO removal 
efficiency elevated to 95 %. That revealed the lower concentration of CO could not offer adequacy reduced 
α-Fe2O3 activity for NO. Although the CO concentration increased from 1910 ppmv to 3980 ppmv but the 
NO removal efficiency all kept above 95 %. And then the CO reacted efficiency were still kept at 55~65 %. 
It demonstrated the continually increased CO concentration that could not to reduce NO anymore.  
In FeOOH catalyst system that there was a linear relation for both CO reacted efficiency and reaction 
temperature in 373~523 K. There was a best NO removal efficiency with reaction temperature in 523 K. 
And CO optimum operation temperature was above 523 K. The CO concentration increased from 1910 
ppmv to 3980 ppmv but the NO removal efficiency all kept 100 %. And then the CO reacted efficiency was 
decreased with the influent CO concentration. According to above experimental results, it demonstrated a 
redox reaction for NO/ CO took place in FeOOH catalyst system.  
It was demonstrated by the above experimental results for α-Fe2O3/ FeOOH catalyst system, which had 
good performance for eliminating NO/ CO vehicle exhaust. To elevate the reaction temperature for FeOOH 
to CO could aid the reaction rate. The α-Fe2O3/ FeOOH catalyst system optimum operation temperature 
was 723 K and 523 K, respectively. And the reaction rate for FeOOH to CO was fast than α-Fe2O3 to CO. 
The advantages for α-Fe2O3/ FeOOH catalyst system is without waste catalyst problem, and not precious. 
The purpose of this study is to derive the optimum operation temperature for these two catalysts 
system. The packed bed reactor (PBR) could cause pressure loss in real emission system 
and may substitutes with supported catalysts to overcome this problem.
