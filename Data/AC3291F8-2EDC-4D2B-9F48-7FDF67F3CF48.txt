Abstract 
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of exertion force (20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % 
of maximum holding capacity) on endurance time, muscular activity and vibration of the box 
during the holding task. The results showed that the endurance time decreased while the 
muscular activity and vibration of the box increased with the exertion force. The endurance 
times of the exertion force of 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of the maximum holding capacity were 
approximately only 22.7 %, 12.0 %, and 5.6 % of the endurance time of the exertion force of 20 
% of the maximum holding capacity. The muscular activity also increased as the time 
proceeded from the initial to the end of holding task. The dominant frequency of the box 
vibration ranged from approximately 6 to 10 Hz across the time phases and four force exertion 
levels.

weight, and stature were 20.7(1.2) years, 68.4(8.6) kg, and 173.3(4.5) cm, respectively. All 
participants were briefed on the purpose and procedure of the experiment prior to their 
participation. 
 
2.2. Experimental Equipment 
The main experiment equipment in this study included a wooden box, an electromyography 
(EMG) instrument and an accelerometer. The dimension of the wooden box was 50 * 35* 15 
cm with cylindrical handles (handle diameter, 3.8 cm) located in the upper middle of the width 
dimension (35 cm). The EMG instrument (MyoScan-Pro EMG, Thought Technology LTD., 
Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was used to record the activities of muscular contraction. The raw 
EMG signals were amplified, filtered (band pass 20 to 500 Hz), rectified, and processed with an 
averaging constant of 200 ms to provide the root mean square (RMS) EMG. The accelerometer 
(model CXL02LF3, Crossbow Technology LTD., San Jose, Ca., USA) was equipped inside the 
bottom of the box to measure the acceleration of the box vibration during the holding tasks. The 
signals of EMG and accelerometer were sampled simultaneously by two personal computers at 
the rate of 32 Hz and 100Hz, respectively. 
 
2.3. Tests of maximum holding capacity 
Several days prior to the formal experiments, each participant was tested his own maximum 
holding capacity which was the basis to determine the exertion forces of holding tasks of that 
individual participant in this study. The participant was asked to stand erectly and grasped the 
handles of the experimental wooden box placed on a height-adjustable table. The height of the 
box was adjusted to fit a 90-degree arms posture when the participant grasped the handles of the 
box. The initial weight of the box was fully balanced and randomly loaded with some 
cylindrical irons. Then, the participant was asked to lift-and-hold the box just clear off the table. 
If the participant succeeded the holding task, he was asked to increase the weight of the box by 
adding more irons, in increments of 2 to 5 kg, and tried the lift-and-hold task again. The 
procedure repeated until the participant failed the lift-and-hold task. At least 2 minutes of rest 
was provided for the participant between two consecutive progressive trials, eliminating the 
effect of fatigue on determining the participant’s maximum holding capability. The initial load 
increments were large but were reduced as the participant approaches his maximum holding 
capability. No any motivational factors were provided to the participant. The participant’s 
maximum holding capability could normally be obtained after approximately five to seven 
trials. 
 
2.4. Independent variables and dependent variable 
The independent variable of this study was the exertion force. Four exertion forces, which were 
20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of the participant’s maximum holding capacity, were examined. 
The dependent variables of this study were the endurance time, activity of muscular contraction 
and vertical acceleration of the box vibration during the holding tasks.

3. Results 
The mean(SD) endurance times for the exertion force of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of the 
participant’s maximum holding capacity were 360.6(121.8) seconds, 81.9(20.3) seconds, 
43.3(11.8) seconds, and 20.4(9.6) seconds, respectively. The endurance times of the exertion 
force of 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of the maximum holding capacity were approximately only 22.7 
%, 12.0 %, and 5.6 % of the endurance time of the exertion force of 20 % of the maximum 
holding capacity, respectively. The results of Duncan’s multiple range tests demonstrated that 
the endurance time of 20 % exertion force was significantly different from those of other 
exertion forces (p < 0.05), while the differences of the endurance times between 40 % and 60 % 
exertion forces, and between 60 % and 80 % exertion forces were not significant (p > 0.05). 
 
Table 1 shows the mean(SD) muscular activities (%MVC) of all participants for the exertion 
force of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of the maximum holding capacity. Table 1 reveals that the 
muscular activities increase with exertion force for all phases. Duncan’s multiple range tests 
demonstrated that the muscular activities among the 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % of exertion 
forces were all significantly different from one another (p < 0.05) for all muscles in all time 
phases, except for the deltoid muscle. Additionally, the muscular activity also increased as the 
time proceeded from the initial to the final phase, except for the deltoid muscle.

Table 2 shows the mean(SD) RMS accelerations (m/s2) for the exertion force of 20 %, 40 %, 60 
% and 80 % of the maximum holding capacity. Table 2 demonstrates that RMS acceleration 
generally increased with the exertion force or time phase. The smallest RMS acceleration 
occurred at 20 % maximum holding capacity while the greatest RMS acceleration occurred at 
60 or 80 % maximum holding capacity. Duncan’s multiple range tests indicated that the 
difference between 20 % and 80 % exertion forces or between the initial and final phases was 
significant (p < 0.05).

Table 3 lists the results of the mean(SD) dominant frequency (Hz) and the associated peak 
accelerations (m/s2) from the spectrum analysis on the acceleration of the box vibration. 
Generally, both dominant frequency and the associated peak acceleration increased with the 
exertion force. However, the differences among the dominant frequencies or the associated peak 
accelerations for the three phases were limited. Duncan’s multiple range tests indicated that the 
differences in peak acceleration or frequency between the pair of 20 % and 80 % of the 
maximum holding capacity were almost significant (p < 0.05) for all phases.

The quantity of acceleration is used to represent the amplitude of vibration in mechanics. In 
neurophysiological study, acceleration is also used to analyze the performance of manipulative 
control (Morrison and Keogh, 2001) or postural tremor (Morrison and Newell, 2000). This 
study measured the acceleration of box vibration to examine the effects of force exertion and 
time phase on the steadiness of hands during holding task. Our general hypothesis was that the 
steadiness of hands would decrease as more force was exerted or as the exertion time proceeded 
due to more difficult in muscular control or muscle fatigue. However, the hypothesis for the 
relationship between acceleration and force exertion only verified in the range of force exertion 
from 20 % to 60 % maximum holding capacity. The RMS accelerations for the 60 % maximum 
holding capacity were approximately1.6, 2.3, and 3 times of that of 20 % maximum holding 
capacity, respectively. Notably, the relationship between acceleration and time phase was 
congruent with our hypothesis. The RMS acceleration of the final phase increased by 
approximately 128%, 33%, 21 %, and 70 % as compared with those of the initial phase, for 20 
%, 40 %, 60 %, and 80% maximum holding capacity, respectively. 
 
Both force exertion and time phase affected the peak acceleration of the box vibration. Force 
exertion affected peak acceleration only for low (20 %) to medium (40 %) force exertion. The 
effect of time phase on peak acceleration was apparent also only for low (20 %) to medium (40 
%) force exertion. The peak accelerations, averaged across three time phases, of the exertion 
force of 40 % and 60 % of the maximum holding capacity were approximately 305 % and 512 
%, respectively, of that of 20 % maximum holding capacity. The effects of force exertion on 
peak acceleration were consistent with that on RMS acceleration, consolidating the hypothesis 
that the steadiness of hands would decrease as more force was exerted during holding. Finally, 
the dominant frequency ranged from approximately 6 to 10 Hz across three time phases and 
four force exertion levels. This result revealed the effect of muscle fatigue or force exertion on 
dominant frequency was limited to a narrow range. However, the range of the dominant 
frequency also indicated the possible range of resonance frequency for holding task.
