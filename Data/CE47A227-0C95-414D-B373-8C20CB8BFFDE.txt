1.研究目的： 
    過去國內研發成功之ROV，其纜線直接連接在工作母船上，然而在有海流或深度較大水
域作業之水下載具，通常需要有纜繩管理系統或中繼系統來協助。為滿足台灣海域各種複雜
環境的作業要求，整合計畫擬開發具備迅速調整作業能力之高適應力的複合模式水下載具系
統，使其能夠因應各式作業任務需求。 
  配合整合計畫之要求，本子計畫預定設計開發一套適用於複合模式水下載具的中繼系統。
此中繼系統的上游部份，以可承受較大張力之纜繩與母船連接，接收電力並傳輸各式控制與
偵測訊號。而下游部份與則依任務需求，與所搭載之 ROV或 AUV 連結。 
 
本年度目標如下： 
1. 掌握下游水下載具的基本規格、各種介面形式與模組化 
2. 制定提供不同水下載具的電源基本資訊，釐訂供電模組規格 
3. 開發中繼站供電部分 
4. 開發中繼站結構部分 
 
2.研究內容： 
2.1 下游水下載具規格 
    本計畫為製作一中繼系統作為水下載具與母船間電力、資訊與訊號等之溝通橋梁，故系
統必須針對下游水下載具規格提供不同電壓或訊號處理，並掌握下游水下載具之基本規格。
與其他子計畫人員討論後，決定以成功大學方銘川教授研究室所開發之 ROV作為下游載具，
該水下載具之供電/訊號規格如下表： 
表一. 下游載具規格 
供應電壓 訊號方式 消耗功率 
48V 網路傳輸(TCP/IP) 1200W(max) 
 
2.2 中繼站主纜繩分析與重量估測： 
    水下中繼系統(Depressor)介於母船與水下載具之間，與母船間以主纜繩連接，而與水下
載具間，則以副纜繩連接。中繼站的功能主要是擔任母船與載具間之緩衝及資訊處理工作，
中繼站佈放後希望能保持在母船正下方，因此需有足夠重量將主纜繩拉直。此處先就主纜繩
在水流不同速度狀況下進行分析。 
    考慮纜繩繫一重物，並將其放入靜止之水中，假設此時有一水流流經此系統，則纜繩位
置會因水流作用於其截面上之力而產生變化。假設此纜繩受穩度水流作用後，其飄移狀態呈
現穩定狀態，在此假設狀態下進行靜力分析。

3. 纜繩分析結果及重量估測： 
    由於水流對纜繩及中繼站的影響，中繼站佈放後不可能會在母船的正下方，故其須有足
夠重量或提供推進器做簡單修正。利用自製的纜繩分析程式可知道在不同水流分佈情況下纜
繩偏移情形，經討論後決定在中繼站於超過 80公尺深度且表面水流速度 2節的情況下中繼站
不可偏移母船超過 10公尺之距離，經程式推算後決定中繼站重量約為 130公斤左右。

Fig.2. 
 
Fig.2. Cuboids of room‟s space 
After that, we use “boundary method” [7] to detect 
pipes‟ collision with obstacles and pipes previously ar-
ranged in engine room. The steps are as follows:  
Step1. To select the collision surface of rectangle by the 
pipe‟s grown direction. For example, X axis is the grown 
direction as Fig.3; therefore Y-Z surface will be the colli-
sion surface. If Y and Z coordinates of the pipe‟s start 
point are both within the boundary of collision surface, it 
means possibilities of collision and detection needs to 
take step2. 
 
Fig.3. Detection of collision surface 
Step2.Collision could be judged by one-dimensional after 
step1. If the length of X direction satisfies one type of the 
collision situations as Fig.4, there will be a collision 
between pipes and obstacles. (MIN and MAX represent 
the boundary of obstacle; min and max mean pipe‟s.) 
 
Fig.4. Collision situations 
2.3 QUANTIZATION OF EQUIPMENT’S 
OPERATING SPACE (EOS) 
It needs to retain the space for personnel‟s activity 
when inspection, operation, and maintenance for equip-
ments. In addition to transform equipments‟ physical 
volume to rectangles, this study proceeds quantization of 
Equipments‟ Operation Space by referring the data of 
human factor. For example, there is a manhole on a drink 
water hydraulic tank as Fig.5 (a). According to the height 
between the highest point of manhole and floor is 1100 
mm, we can assume that personnel will take squatting 
pose when disassemble the manhole. Consulting adult 
anthropometric data, width of adult shoulder is within 
400 to 450mm, and length between hip and knee is 550 
to 600mm, so it could be defined a 450*600*1100 (mm) 
rectangle as a EOS like Fig.5 (b). 
 
Fig.5. Quantization of hydraulic tank operating space 
We apply the previous mentioned method to detect 
collision between EOS and pipes. However EOS isn‟t 
existence as entity, it‟s belong to virtual obstacle. Even if 
the pipeline passes through EOS, it does not produce a 
real collision. In other words, if the necessity of pipeline 
arrangement is pretty high at this space, or of EOS is 
relatively low, this space could let the pipeline passing.  
This research considers the necessity of EOS by 
“Equipment Operability” and calculates in fitness value 
of design with penalty function; the details will be de-
scribed at section 3.2. 
3. APPLICATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHM 
IN PIPELINE ARRANGEMENT 
3.1 CONFIGURATION AND PARAMETERS FOR 
GENETIC ALGORITHM 
Genetic Algorithm is an optimization search method 
for simulating evolution by computer artificial intelli-
gence [8]. The calculating mode first picks up an initial 
population at random, and then retains better individuals 
by “Survival of the fittest”. These retainable individuals 
will progress evolution for new generations by three 
procedures- Selection, Crossover, and Mutation [9]. 
  
 
tance （ E1 ,N1 ,U1 ） and calculated distance
（E2 ,N2 ,U2）of the start to the end. P1=|E1-
E2|，P2=|N1-N2|，P3= |U1-U2|。 
• P4：The value of penalty when detecting physical 
collision of pipes and obstacles. Judging the final 
array whether their coordinates are within the 
range of occupied cubes or not. If there is a colli-
sion, P4 = 500; otherwise, P4 = 0.  
• P5：The value of penalty that judges EOS is re-
served or not by detecting virtual collision be-
tween pipes and EOS. Relative to detection of 
physical collision, these values are depended on 
“Equipment Operability”-C0, which is defined by 
importance of each EOS. In an EOS, we will give  
different penalty values according to the location 
of collision with pipes, and it can divided into 
three parts by three directions (E，N，U). For 
example, we assumed a pipe crossed an EOS of 
equipment as Fig.10. 
 
Fig.10. Locations of pipe and EOS 
There is a pipe along east-west direction in 
front of the manhole, so it had to check the pipe‟s 
height first. As Fig.11 and Fig.12 shown, if its 
height (u) is higher than manhole‟s location (mU-
min), it will produce a serious influence for man-
hole‟s operation, and to avoid this situation the 
penalty value (Cu) should be defined bigger; but if 
its height is lower than mUmin, the influence and 
the value will be smaller even though the space 
for person standing is interfered. 
 
         Fig.11. View of N axis 
 
Fig.12. Penalty value of U axis 
Second, we use the view of N axis to check 
the penalty value (Ce) of E axis like Fig.13. If the 
overlap between pipe and manhole is more, it 
represented the more influence for manhole‟s op-
eration. When the scope of overlap exceeds the 
center of manhole (mEm), it causes the total inter-
ference of manhole‟s operation; therefore we set 
the biggest penalty value for this situation.  
 
Fig.13. View of N axis 
 
Fig.14. Penalty value of E axis 
Last, it turns to see the view of E axis (Fig.15) 
and defining the penalty value of N axis (Cn). It 
depends on the distance (n) from a pipe to a man-
hole. If they are closer, Cn will be bigger as Fig.16. 
 
Fig.15. View of E axis  
  
 
Step1. To read the environment data of basic sample 
(Fig.17) through the pipeline drawing interface, and then 
produce two files as Table 1 and Table 2 for the next step.

BOX2 375 -375 4075 3425 1625 25 Op=0.1 
P.S. We marked rectangular type on the last column “Type”: 
“Re” means real cuboids; and “Op” means virtual cuboids 
for EOS. The value of “Op” represents its significance of 
Equipment‟s Operability.  
Step2. Entering a general setting of parameters and data 
of rectangular boundary without consideration of EOS 
into the pipeline calculating interface-GA for Piping 
Route (Fig.18), and it will provide the suggested result 
for the pipeline arrangement when the system stop calcu-
lating.  
 
Fig.18. GA of Piping Route 
Fig.19 is the result without consideration of EOS; ob-
viously it can see that fitness stops decreasing after gen-
erations are more than 25, and Fig.20 shows the pipeline 
arrangements with different fitness values. Because there 
were more elbows and longer length in Fig.20 (a), its 
fitness is bigger than Fig.20 (b). If the manhole needs to 
be operated in this case, it has to dismantle the pipes. 
That doesn‟t satisfy the demands of operation and main-
tenance.  The main idea of this research is investigating 
and solving this problem, and the consideration of 
Equipments‟ Operability test will be discussed and ex-
plained at section 4.3.

Fig.20.Different fitnesses 
4.2 PARAMETER SELECTION 
4.2.1 Population size 
The population size depends on the scope of envi-
ronment and complexity of pipeline, the greater size of 
population spend longer time for evolution, and the 
quality of generation will be better; otherwise, it spends 
shorter time with worse quality. Setting an appropriate 
size can help GA to take efficiency and quality [3]. The 
test result (Table 3) shows that GA with difference popu-
lation sizes but for same objective. When the number of 
population is 200, GA can search the objective with the 
least generations.  
Table 3 Results of different population size 
Population Time Generation 
100 00:11.7 140 
150 00:10.5 60 
200 00:09.8 45 
250 00:16.6 95 
300 00:41.6 250 
When the population size is lower than 200, although 
the time of every generation‟s evolution is faster, the 
quality of individual is worse. Therefore, the number of 
generations and the time of calculation will become more 
and longer. Conversely, when the size is more than 200, 
the time of calculation also increases with the population 
size. For this reason, we select 200 for our population 
size. 
4.2.2 Rates of crossover and mutation 
In general, in order to maintain the diversity of search, 
improve the scope of distribution for search points, and 
  
 
cating oil cooler, M\E air cooler and fresh water cooler 
sequentially,  finally discharge outside the ship.  
 
Fig.25. Seawater cooling system diagram 
 
Fig.26. Equipments arrangement 
First, our system transforms the sea chests, pump, 
cooler and other equipments to rectangles, judges the 
coordinates, directions, and bore of every cooler nozzle 
for the start and end points. The layout of the relevant 
equipments is shown in Fig.26. 
In Fig.27, the oval-shaped area is marked as the space 
for personnel activity and equipments‟ maintenance. 
Because the pipeline arrangement doesn‟t consider 
Equipment Operability, it passes though the oval-shaped 
area, and occupied the space that will be necessary when 
operation and/or maintain is carried out. 
 
Fig.27. Pipeline arrangement without EO consideration 
Next we set the oval-shaped area as Equipment Oper-
ation Space, and calculate again. The result shown in  
Fig.28 indicates obvious difference to Fig.27. After EO 
consideration, pipeline will be arranged under the deck in 
order to avoid EOS, and this type of pipeline arrange-
ment is more conformed to the real situation in ship‟s 
engine room pipeline arrangement.  
 
Fig.28.Optimal pipeline design with EO 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
This study used GA to optimize the design of pipeline 
arrangement with comprehensive cost and consideration 
of equipments‟ operability by the penalty functions and 
redefinition of chromosome‟s coding. Based on two 
programs, we performed above concepts to a system, and 
then use it to verify the pipeline arrangement in real M\E 
seawater cooler system. The main conclusions of this 
research are as follows:  
1. Pipeline drawing interface can transform physical 
and virtual volume of equipments to rectangles; it 
saves time in recording coordinates and improves 
efficiency. 
2. After GA calculation, this system can use “Data 
Input” to automatically draw the best pipeline path 
in 3D environment. User can estimate whether this 
pipeline is achieved optimal design by entities.  
3. Because inserting the Equipment Operability to the 
penalty functions, the optimal design of pipeline 
arrangement upgrades from economic cost down to 
comprehensive cost down which includes econom-
ic and human factors. And it also can get the best 
solution for the shortest path or detoured path by 
this concept which changes the convergence trend 
of GA calculation. 
4. After considering EO in real ship‟s pipeline ar-
rangement, the pipeline could be closer to practical 
design. The higher frequency of personnel using 
EOS, the higher possible of EOS preservation. 
The optimal design of pipeline arrangement in this 
paper is based on single pipe; it doesn‟t consider coordi-
nates of branches and their directions of path extension

METHODS OF PAYMENT 
What is the C.V.V code? 
A 'CVV code' appears on most credit and debit cards. It provides an additional security measure to prevent fraudulent use of cards. The CVV 
code is an extra three or four digits usually found on the back of your card, on the signature strip. The last few digits of your card may be 
repeated before the code - but it is just the last set of digits that you need to enter for the CVV code. On American Express cards, the security

除了 22 日上午筆者發表論文之外，也聽取多場論文發表。因為這次
的主要議題為電腦在造船產業之應用(Computer Applications in Shipbuild-
ing)，因此大多數的文章都是圍繞在軟體、程式、系統構想等方面。而在
各式各樣的議題中，結合不同領域的現有系統(或軟體)，整合成一個大系
統，來提昇造船流程作業效率的文章最多。舉例來說，由日本 Universal 
Shipbuilding Corporation 所提出的論文：「Development of  “Block Lifting 
Simulation System” with Ship 3D CAD Model 」，系開發大組合工廠所製造
銲接好的 block 吊到船台上進行組裝或是翻轉等作業的模擬系統。block 吊
掛與安裝模擬是目前提昇船廠效率最急需的一環；其主要的工作項目包
含：預估 block 的重量與重心位置、纜繩固定位置的決定、每一條吊掛纜
繩的作動程序、評估吊掛過程纜繩所受覆載是否安全等等工作。而這些工
作必須運用到繪圖軟體與設計時建立的幾何圖檔，結構計算用的 CAE 軟
體，顯示模擬流程的動畫系統等。因為上述三種軟體當初開發時，有各自
的應用對象，完全沒有考量到與其他軟體結合的問題，各自有自己的數據
與檔案格式，因此在整合過程需要花費很大功夫。這類型關於系統整合的
論文，雖然是造船產業生產、設計所需要的應用系統，但是需要依賴具備
資訊工程人員來進行程式撰寫工作，也是一項很特別的開發模式。 
除了研究論文發表之外，在會場並設有歐洲各主要研發機構、船舶儀
器廠商、系統整合商等單位所提供的攤位 (例如：AVEVA、Virtalis、
SIEMENS 等)，展示各家的最新研發成果、產品展示以及宣傳文宣等。這
些活動提供船舶科技的最新發展現狀，除了讓與會者在休息空檔能夠接觸
技術開發資訊之外，透過自家新技術的展示，提昇公司形象，達到商業行
銷也是目的之一。 
另外依照國際研討會的慣例，除了主要的研討會之外，通常主辦單位
還會安排相關的 technical tours。此次的 tours 為 23 日上午參訪 Trieste 附近

科技在造船產業應用上，若將細節公開容易遭到模仿與學習，同時涉及到
眾多的商業行為，或許是考慮到後續的技術機密，因此歐美國家的論文中
對於技術這一塊，相當地保留。 
另外在各國參加者的表現上，在發表結束後的詢答時間，韓國出席者
的發言相當活躍；如果演講內容在韓國國內已經有這方面的應用或經驗的
話，通常會在詢問時提出：這個韓國也有類似系統..等等 comment，甚至
會對演講者的內容提出質疑或檢討。個人覺得一方面表示韓國參加者能夠
掌握演講內容，另一方面也顯示出他們對於自己國家造船產業的自信。在
筆者演講後的答詢問題中，一位韓國聽講者就想瞭解我們研究所使用的軟
體名稱。通常這種問題不一定適合在答詢場合提出，但是這位韓國人也很
大膽的提出來，讓我對於他們的風格，留下深刻印象。其實不只是這次會
議，在個人最近參加的幾次國際會議，或多或少都感受到這種強勢的韓國
作風。也是造船大國的日本，相對的就比較內斂，發言詢問演講者的狀況
也比較少。這種現象是否在某種程度也反映出：造船產業霸主地位，已經
轉移到韓國的現狀。
