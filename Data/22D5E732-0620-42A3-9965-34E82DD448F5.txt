所以，LEACH 不能保証一定會找到如圖 1(a)中的分群架構。

2   Related Works 
In recent years, some WSN positioning technologies 
have been proposed, including Received Signal 
Strength (RSS) [6], [12], Angle of Arrival (AOA) 
[5], [7], Time of Arrival (TOA) and Time 
Difference of Arrival (TDOA)[2], [4], [10], [14]. 
RRS uses the signal strength received to measure 
the distance between targets. However, it is easily 
affected by noises, such as shielding effect and 
multi-path fading, which cause relatively large error 
in distance measurement. AOA uses hardware like 
sector antennae or an antenna array to help judge the 
angle of signal reception between a base station and 
its nodes.  However, this method can only give 
accurate measuring outcomes under the existence of 
line of sight (LOS) between transmitter and receiver. 
TOA measures the propagation delay (At) of electro-
magnetic waves between nodes (A and B) and ob-
tains the distance (
AB
d~ ) between two nodes by 
multiplying the speed of electromagnetic wave (C). 
The formula is:  
 
CAd tAB *
~ =      (1) 
 
TDOA is based on the TOA, which uses timing 
to measure the corresponding relative arrival time 
from one to another node. TDOA needs at least 
three position-known nodes as its bases. 
Geometrically, two lines are considered as two 
equations. The intersection of these two equations is 
the position of the unknown node. The equations for 
the aforementioned are shown, respectively, as:

~Δ  is the difference of DA and DC, toABD~Δ  is the 
difference of DA and DB. Suppose there are three 
known coordinate nodes around node D: A (xa,ya), 
B(xb,yb), and C(xc,yc). The Euclid Distance Formula 
can be used to define the following formula:

Substitute (3) into (2): The relative coordinate of an 
unknown node can be gained. This method is not 
like TOA, which needs exact time synchronization. 
The advantage of TDOA is that using relative 
arrival delay to replace absolute arrival delay can 
eradicate the difficulty of time synchronization and 
error caused by measurement. 
 Both the above methods, TOA and TDOA, do 
not need too much extra equipment, which conforms 
to the requirement of low cost of sensor network. 
TDOA does not need exact time synchronization 
and its accuracy is higher than that of TOA. There 
are obstacles (for example, buildings) and non-line 
of sight (NLOS) [15-16], [21], for example, the 
signal reflection and diffraction) disturbances in 
realistic environment, which may reduce the 
precision of the whole positioning system and 
causes relatively large error. Moreover, those noises 
would cause large error and reduce the precision of 
positioning when measuring distance using AOA 
and RSS. 
 
 
3   Hierarchical Localization Strategy 
To improve positioning of sensor nodes and lower 
costs, based on TDOA measurement, we propose a 
hierarchical positioning strategy. Our strategy fo-
cused on two elements: First, estimation error’s cor-
rection. Second, position computing and hierarchi-
cal localization. We use simple statistics for the 
correction of error of distance measurement in order 
to reduce the consumption of energy and to improve 
the precision of positioning. When nodes are 
deployed in real environments, diverse noises will 
delay signal transmission. The more noises exist, the 
larger the error in the estimated location will be. 
Thus, the exactness of propagation delay measured 
between two nodes is extremely important. Main 
causes of time delay of packets transmission is 
NLOS and multi-path delay [1], [15], [16]. To 
improve the precision of node positioning, we must 
cut back on the possible distance error. 
 
 
3.1 Estimation Error Correction 
 
Multicasting of wireless network causes multi-path 
delay. Packets perhaps pass through many paths to 
reach a source node or a destination node. Hoping to 
overcome this kind of time delay, we add a 
parameter, called Hop_Count, into the packet to 
record how many times the packet has been relayed. 
To avoid accumulation of error, we only take 1-hop 
relaying into account. Time delay caused by NLOS

To solve equation Ax=b, we can get the relative 
coordinate value (x, y) of the unknown node. 
 
 
3.3 Hierarchical Localization 
 
All nodes are divided into three categories in our 
proposed method, as shown in Fig.1. The first cate-
gory is beacon points (BPs) whose relative locations 
are known. We scatter BPs throughout the whole 
network. The second category is relay nodes (RNs) 
which can obtain information from at least three 
different BPs. Both BPs and RNs are defined in the 
Level-1. The third is compute nodes (CNs) which 
have yet to be positioned. These nodes cannot 
gather information from at least three different BPs. 
If they cannot obtain sufficient information from 
BPs then they retain what they have obtained and 
try to collect the information they need from RNs. If 
CNs are unable to collect any information from BPs, 
then they need to collect all necessary information 
from surrounding RNs. The level of CNs is Level-2 
by definition. All the nodes belonging to Level-1 
will be located as top priority throughout the whole 
positioning process. 
 
 
4   Simulation and Results 
In order to prove that the method we put forward 
cannot only reduce cost but also offer more reliable 
location information on a sensor node, we used a 
simulation to conduct an experiment. We simulated 
how a survey distance error is modified and the 
node positioning is done. Furthermore we used 
simulation to compare our methods and TDOA and 
show the differing simulation results, including the 
difference between estimated location and the true 
location of an unknown node and the modification 
of survey distance error. 
 
4.1 System parameters of simulation 
 
The simulator is developed by MATLAB. The sys-
tem parameters are as follows: the network size is 
100×100 square meters (m2), the relative location of  
BPs are (0, 50), (0, 0), (50, 50), (50, 0), (50, 100), 
(100, 50), (0, 100), (100, 0) and (100, 100), the 
effective communication range is 50 meters, the 
number of sensor nodes is 200, randomly distributed 
in the network, the distances between all the nodes 
are different and the occurrences of distance 
measurement are 20. In the experiment, we set the 
noise parameter as follows: one is in a larger scale 
of noise, adding a random error between 0.2 to 1 to 
true distance between two nodes; the other is in a 
smaller scale of noise, adding a random error 
between 0.05 to 0.1 to true distance. 
 
 
4.2 Simulation Results 
 
First, we ran the modification experiments for the 
measured distance between two nodes to ensure that 
the measured distance after modification can 
approximate more to the true distance that the dis-
tance without modification does. The simulation ran 
200 times under different noise conditions and the 
minimum distance was chosen as the comparison 
baseline. The experiment results for measured dis-
tance are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Red lines 
represent the original distance difference between 
minimum distance and actual distance. Blue lines 
represent the difference of the distance measurement 
with error correction from the actual distance. In 
Fig.2 where the scale of noises is bigger, after error 
modification of distance measurement the average 
error of 200 rounds is 0.95981 (m), the comparison 
group being 7.006523 (m). In Fig. 3 where the scale 
of noises is smaller, after error modification of 
distance measurement the average error of 200 
rounds is 1.186104 (m), and that of the comparison 
group is 1.654109 (m). The experiment shows that 
the measured distance between two nodes is closer 
to the actual distance. Especially in surroundings of 
more noise, a more accurate survey distance can be 
gained. The actual position and estimated position

To further prove that better results can be achieved 
with our method, simulation was done 100 times in 
two different surroundings and the estimations were 
averaged for analysis. First, a simulation was 
undertaken 100 times under a larger scale of noise, 
and the average estimation errors of nodes be-
longing to Level-1 are shown in Fig. 6.  The average

and BP induced ill geometry shape and bigger 
estimated error [1], [16].There is a potential 
problem in the level 2. If the relative locations 
of RNs and CN form an ill geometry shape 
might cause a bigger estimated error [1], [16]. 
In the level 2, CN and nearby three RNs may 
not form the shape showed in the 9 (a), in which 
three circles drawn from the radiuses of 
distance from each RN to CN will overlap. True 
CN is likely to locate in this overlapped area. If 
the relative locations of RNs and CN are 
formed as 9(b), 9(c), and 9(d), the error will still 
exist even the measured distance is modified. 
The estimated position will seriously deviate 
through the aggregate errors. 
 
 
5   Conclusion 
In this paper, we propose a low cost and high posi-
tioning rate hierarchical localization strategy for 
sensor networks. Our strategy, based on TDOA, a 
few BPs and positioned RNs, is used to assist the 
localization of a whole network of nodes. The 
advantage of this method is that it can reduce the 
considerable cost and energy consumption by 
reducing extra positioning hardware. In order to en-
hance the precision of positioning, simple statistics 
are used to improve the error of survey distance be-
tween two nodes. The simulation results show that 
our method outperforms TDOA.

Substitute (3) into (2): The relative coordinate of an 
unknown node can be gained. Both the above 
methods, TOA and TDOA, do not need too much 
extra equipment, which conforms to the requirement 
of low cost of sensor network. TDOA does not need 
exact time synchronization and its accuracy is higher 
than that of TOA. 
 
 
3   Hierarchical Localization Strategy 
To improve positioning of sensor nodes and lower 
costs, based on TDOA measurement, we propose a 
hierarchical positioning strategy. Our strategy fo-
cused on two elements: First, estimation error’s cor-
rection. Second, position computing and hierarchical 
localization. We use simple statistics for the correc-
tion of error of distance measurement in order to re-
duce the consumption of energy and to improve the 
precision of positioning. When nodes are deployed in 
real environments, diverse noises will delay signal 
transmission. The more noises exist, the larger the 
error in the estimated location will be. Thus, the 
exactness of propagation delay measured between 
two nodes is extremely important. Main causes of 
time delay of packets transmission is multi-path 
delay and non-line of sight (NLOS) [1], [5]. 
Multicasting of wireless network causes multi-path 
delay. Packets perhaps pass through many paths to 
reach a source node or a destination node. To avoid 
accumulation of error, we only take 1-hop relaying 
into account. To improve the precision of node 
positioning, we must cut back on the possible 
distance error. 
 
 
3.1 Estimation Error Correction 
 
Time delay caused by NLOS is the most difficult to 
overcome. Up to now, there has been no effective 
way to eliminate this error. NLOS is a kind of time 
delay due to reflection and diffraction when a wave 
meets an obstacle. This causes a packet’s propagation 
delay, which affects the precision of distance 
measurement. The consequence is the increase of 
error due to the longer transmission time of a packet. 
In order to improve the measurement of survey 
distance, we designed a new distance formula: 
 
edR +=      (4) 
 
R is the survey distance between two nodes, d is the 
true distance, e is the error variable of measurement. 
We use multiple times measurement and the concept 
of standard deviation to obtain a relatively reasonable 
error term. Suppose we measure k times of distance 
between two nodes, and we express k-times measured 
distance by one-dimensioned vector (L). 
 
kkRRRL ×= 121 ],....,,[  
 
We analyzed the possible error occurring in the meas-
uring process and, furthermore, subtracting the error 
term from the survey distance. Use vector L to 
calculate the standard deviation of survey distance:

We can get a pure error value from formula (5). Since 
the survey distance is bigger than the true distance, 
we expect to get a value extremely close to the true 
distance. We thus use the minimum survey distance 
to subtract standard deviation. The modified formula 
is,  
 
σ−= min' Rd      (6) 
 
d’ in formula (6) is the new survey distance between 
two nodes. 
 
3.2 Position Computing 
 
When an unknown node modifies the survey distance, 
substitute the modified distance value into formula (2) 
to estimate the best location of the unknown node. 
Suppose unknown node (x, y) has got enough loca-
tion information (x1 , y1), (x2 , y2), (x3 , y3), and the 
measurement distances after modification are , , 
. The new formula is:

distance measurement the average error of 200 
rounds is 0.95981 (m), the comparison group being 
7.006523 (m). The experiment shows that our 
method is closer to the actual distance. The actual 
position and estimated position of nodes are shown in 
Fig. 3. Red circles represent the actual position of 
nodes. Green asterisks, belonging to level-1, 
represent the nodes which are estimated from at least 
three BPs. Blue squares represent the estimated 
locations of nodes, belonging to level-2. In the 
following simulation process, a comparison is made 
between our method and TDOA. The result is shown 
in Fig. 4, in which we can find obvious differences 
between the two methods. Next, the location 
estimation of the 200 unknown nodes in single round 
is compared to TDOA. With our method, the largest 
location error is 71.9221 (m), the smallest 0.1384 (m) 
and the average 2.6006 (m). With TDOA, the largest 
is 70.3803 (m), the smallest 0.2260 (m) and the 
average is 11.0588 (m). Our method obviously 
obtains a more precise location. We further ran the 
experiment 100 times and recorded every positioning 
biases of nodes in the diverse levels. Then the 
average positioning biases in all levels for every 
rounds were showed in the Fig. 5 and Fig.6.  Fig. 5
