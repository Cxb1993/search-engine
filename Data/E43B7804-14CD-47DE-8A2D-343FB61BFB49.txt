 Abstract 
Separating a reentry vehicle into warhead, main body, and debris is a conventional and 
efficient means of producing a huge decoy and increasing the kinetic energy of the warhead. 
This procedure causes the radar to track the main body and debris, whose radar cross section 
are large, and ignore the warhead, which is the most important part of the reentry vehicle. 
Moreover, radar tracking suffers from clutters in the form of unwanted, unavoidable and 
unpredictable signal echos from sea, land, and weather. The warhead is difficult to be 
identified after separation using standard tracking criteria in a cluttered environment. This 
investigation presents a novel tracking algorithm to track warhead among objects separation 
from the reentry vehicle in clutter environments. The proposed algorithm composes of the 
targets acquisition algorithm based on the Hough transform, extended Kalmn filter with 
input estimation, and modified probabilistic data association filter. This algorithm provides a 
good tracking capability for the warhead ignoring the radar cross section and effects of 
clutters. Simulation results reveal that the errors between the updated and warhead 
trajectories are reduced to a small interval in a short time. Therefore, the radar can keep 
tracking the warhead all the time from a scan. In conclusion, this algorithm is worthy of 
further study and application.

1.  Introduction 
Separation of the reentry vehicle (RV) into several objects, including the warhead, 
main body and debris during the reentry phase, is an effective means of confusing radar by 
generating many sets of measurements. The radar estimates and predicts the target trajectory 
at the next sampling period from the measurement with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and 
forms beams to illuminate it. The body or debris is then tracked and intercepted first, since 
its radar cross section is inevitably larger than that of the warhead. The warhead, which is the 
most significant part of the reentry vehicle, will be a new track or be completely disregarded. 
Identification of warhead should be achieved among these sets of objects. Furthermore, 
clutter describes unwanted signal echo from sea, land, or weather. Clutter is unavoidable and 
unpredictable in radar tracking, and cause radar to randomly receive numerous echos in one 
scan. This makes the warhead identification problem more complicated and serious. 
Two issues, estimation of warhead trajectory and origination of measurements, are 
induced to solve this problem. If a warhead does not alter its trajectory in separation, then it 
typically follows the original trajectory closely. However, the body and debris fall down 
faster than the warhead and clutters appear in random locations and directions. Then, the 
heading of warhead is the key factor to identify it based on the predicted states at previous 
time interval. An on-line precision trajectory estimation approach is required to establish the 
baseline. Data association technique can be adopted to solve the origination problem. 
The main problems with the on-line estimation of RV or warhead trajectory relate to 
model validation, owing to model error between the mathematical model and the physical 
system. Model error generally results from simplifying assumptions, maneuvering and 
unpredictable external forces during flight or from parameter uncertainty. The extended 
Kalman filter (EKF) is a well-known state estimation scheme, but fails to rapidly achieve the 
required accuracy. Lee and Liu developed a filter associating the EKF with Input estimation 
(IE) to handle model validation problems, and presented an accurate trajectory estimation 
approach for RV in a clear environment [1,2,3,4]. Their proposed filter was widely applied 
to many areas and is helpful to this problem [5,6,7]. 
Bar-Shalom designed a suboptimal Bayesian algorithm, probabilistic data association 
filter (PDAF) [8,9], for tracking a single target in a cluttered environment. It predicts the 
 3
acquisition algorithm choose two sets of measurements. Section 5 presents the MPDAF to 
have the combined warhead trajectory for tracking purposes. Section 6 then summarizes the 
simulation analysis of the proposed filter in different cases. Finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section 7. 
2.  Dynamic Equations 
Define the radar Cartesian coordinate system to be centered at the radar site OR with 
three axes downrange XR, offrange YR, and altitude ZR. Figure 1 shows a vehicle in the 
reentry phase over a flat and nonrotating earth. Assume the RV is a point mass with constant 
weight following a ballistic trajectory in which two significant forces, drag and gravity, that 
act on the RV. Extra forces are induced by model error when assumptions are violated or the 
RV undertakes a maneuver. The RV trajectory model can be written as [16]

where ε  denotes the measurement noise vector, which is assumed to be normally distributed 
with mean zero and variance R. Equations (5) and (6) are the dynamic equations for the RV 
during reentry.  
The radar predicts the target position at the next sampling period according to a set of 
measurements, and creates a search pattern to illuminate the predicted position to track the 
target. The phased array radar emits radar beams to form a certain search pattern centered at 
the predicted target position. This pattern is formed by several radar beams shown in Fig. 2. 
Once the traget is outside the pattern, the tracking procedure will be terminated.  
The RV separates into No objects, including the warhead, body and debris, at stt = . 
The warhead generally flies along a slightly different trajectory from that of the original RV 
if no action is conducted. The body and debris then deviate from the original  RV trajectory, 
and fall on their own. Equations of motion for the warhead with the ballistic coefficient

3. Extended Kalman Filter with Input Estimation 
The input estimation algorithm estimates unknown inputs in state equations from 
pseudo-residuals. The predicted and updated states vectors of the RV by the EKF from 
t n t= ∆  to t n t= +( )1 ∆ , n = 0 1 2, , ,... , under known input vector )(nu  are given by, 
respectively, [18]

In Eq. (18), k and s respectively denote the starting and stopping indices of the system 
input, which can be obtained by testing. Two hypotheses, exitence and absence of inputs, are 
set. Each normalized estimated input at time k+l-1 locates on the confidence interval [-tst, tst] 
if the first hypotheis is satisfied. Otherwise, the input is absent. The confidence interval can 
be obtained from the cumulative normal distribution table for a certain preset confidence 
level α−1  [3].  
Once the input is estimated, the EKF is corrected with the estimated input at the same 
time. By incorporating the on-line input estimator into the EKF, the predicted and updated 
states at time interval k t t k s t∆ ∆≤ ≤ +( )  are given by

We select a set of measurements among No+Nc sets if its HT in Eq. (30) or (31) shares a 
common point with Eqs. (32) and (33). 
 Let the common point of Eqs. (32) and (33) be located at ),( ** θρ . It is possible to 
determine that ),( ** θρ  satisfies one of Eq. (30) or (31). For simplicity and tolerating the

where θ∆  indicates the step size representing the tolerance of θ and θπθ ∆=M . The sets 
of jρ  corresponding to jθ  for Eqs. (30)∼(33) are then defined. The difference of jρ  under 
jθ  for the predicted states is defined as follow

As previously mentioned, trajectory of the warhead is closer to the original than of the 
body, debris, and clutters. The association probabilities of the ith object is inversely 
proportional to length of the normalized innovation in position and is then defined as [12]

where )(tRt denotes the slant range to the warhead at time t and bwθ  represents beamwidth 
of the radar beam and let bwθ =1.2°. θ∆  relates the tolerance of finding *θ  and )1( +∆ nρ . In 
this section, let o5=∆θ . The sampling period of the radar and confidance level are set to 
∆t=0.25seconds and 1-α=0.95, respectively. Figures 8∼12 show the measured position and 
velocity of the warhead, body, and debris, respectively. Moreover, Figs. 13∼15 demonstrate 
four clutter locations in three axes spread out around the warhead within rb. It is necessary to 
estimate  and predict the warhead trajectory based on these eight sets of measurements.  
Figure 16 illustrates the association probabilities assigned to warhead and other object 
by Method I.  The association probability assigned to warhead almost reaches one rapidly 
that reduces the effcts of other object to almost zero. Figures 17 and 18 display the position 
and velocity estimation errors w.r.t. warhead by using Method I, respectively, that restrict 
within ±25m and ±20m/sec. Figure 19 depicts their norms which are lower than 30m and 
20m/sec. This results lead the warhead to be tracked well. Figure 20 gives the association 
probability provided by Method II. The association probability assigned to the warhead 
approachs to zero gradually. Spikes in this figure indicates the involvement of clutters in 
estimation and worsen the problem. Figures 21 and 22 illustrate the estimation errors in 
position and velocity, respectively, generated by Method II that are in 1200m ∼ -2800m and 
200 m/sec ∼ -350m/sec and are much larger than.  The error norms shown in Fig. 23 are also 
much larger than for Method I. Obviously, Method I is superior to Method II and provides a 
good tracking maintainance to the warhead.  
The ballistic coefficient is the critical parameter for obtaining the RV and warhead 
trajectories from dynamic equations under some assumptions. The ballistic coefficient is a 
function of time and is hard to be measured by the defender. A constant is usually set in the 
entire estimation procedure. In this case, the robustness property of the proposed approach is 
evaluated by changing the ballistic coefficient. Figures 24∼35 demonstrate the association 
probabilities and estimation error norm for Methods I and II under three different ballistic 
coefficients. The association probabilities and error norms induced by Method I indicates 
that only a little change is achieved due to the parameter variation. The association

計劃成果自評 
計劃目標 
重返載具以其高速度與高重返角度，增加雷達追蹤之困難；再加以於重返階
段，可能採取其他作為，使得持續追蹤異常困難。在可能採行之作為包括有：以操
縱性改變彈道、分裂彈頭、彈體與多個碎片分離以混淆偵測等，均對雷達之持續追
蹤鎖定造成嚴重影響；再者，雷達於偵測過程中，無法避免雜波或類似雜波特性之
干擾絲之干擾，均將造成偵測之困難。輸入估測法已成功對具操縱性之重返載具彈
道，進行估測與預估，其精度可達數公尺之內，遠較擴展型卡曼濾波器之估測效果
為佳，是為可實際應用之估測方法。對於分離之彈體，亦成功結合修正型機率數據
結合濾波器，可將彈頭與彈體分離，而於短時間內準確鎖定彈頭，且對具操縱性之
彈頭，仍維持穩定之追蹤，此對重返載具之作戰，具有極重要之意義。面臨一般之
雜波偵測環境，以及重返載具可能分裂更多之碎片，單以擴展型卡曼濾波器、輸入
估測與修正型機率數據結合濾波器進行估測，已無法準確偵測彈頭，而須另覓他
途。 
彈體、碎片與雜波有一相同之特性，即其彈道或位置與原彈道均有相當之差
異；亦即其速度方向之變異量相當大，此為辨識彈頭之重要因素。Hough 轉換為一
用於影像處理之技術，以偵測影像內之直線。本計劃針對此一課題，擬引入以
Hough 轉換作為先行過濾雜波與碎片，而後再送入原發展偵測彈頭之法則內，若通
過 Hough 轉換之回跡中，包含彈頭之回跡，以前所發展之法則性能，應可於短時間
內準確鎖定彈頭。因而可建立有效之目標辨識與持續追蹤法則，期能增進數位雷達
對重返載具之追蹤鎖定之能力。 
 
計劃成果 
本計劃成功結合 Hough 轉換、擴展型卡曼濾波器、輸入估測與機率數據結合濾
波器，發展一新追蹤法則，使得數位雷達得能於雜波偵測環境下，重返載具分解為
彈體、彈體與多個碎片時，仍能持續追蹤彈頭，不至於誤鎖彈體、碎片或雜波，而
喪失攔截彈頭之機會，造成重大之傷害。經由模擬證明，本法則確可達成計劃目
標，此對反彈道飛彈之發展，具有重大之效益，值得持續發展。 
 
建議 
本法則初步證明，可滿足計劃需求，但建議持續以不同模式所產生之數據，及
實測之數據，加以驗證與評估，增加可靠度，以實際應用於系統之上。
