Abstract 
The main purpose of this report is to study the safety of the moving high-speed train due to 
earthquakes and foundation settlements using finite element analyses. The moving trains are 
modeled as the combination of nonlinear wheel elements, visco-elastic spring-damper 
elements and lumped mass moving in the X direction, and the bridge, foundation, and 
embankment are modeled according to the actual condition of the Taiwan high-speed rail. 
The Newton-Raphson method and Newmark’s direct integration method are used to solve the 
nonlinear finite element analysis. Theoretical solutions and field experimental results are then 
used to validate the current finite element model in good agreement.  
For moving high-speed train during an earthquake loading, the ability of a maximum 
ground acceleration of only 0.17 g in the Jiasian earthquake on March 4, 2010 to derail a train 
is still doubtful. The finite element results of this report indicate that the bridge system may 
have significantly magnified the seismic load, especially due to a resonance between bridges 
and earthquakes. Moreover, the X direction (in the train direction) earthquake caused a large 
sharp vertical displacement between two simply supported girders, so the train wheels 
passing this gap generated impact loads that produced high frequency vibrations, and large 
derailment coefficients were generated. Due to these reasons, a moderate earthquake, such as 
the Jiasian-earthquake in Taiwan, may derail a high-speed train. Since bridges are often built 
for high-speed trains, avoiding derailment is an important issue that deserves further 
attention. 
For moving high-speed train under bridge foundation settlements, the sharp 
displacements between two simply supported girders caused by the foundation settlement or 
rotation will generate large train derailment coefficients. Other than at the locations between 
two girders, the derailment coefficients are significantly small. The derailment coefficients 
increase when the foundation settlement or rotation increase, but the relationship is not linear. 
The derailment coefficients can be greatly enlarged, when the vertical settlement or Y rotation 
(transverse direction) of the foundation is over a certain safe value, but this condition was not 
found for the foundation X rotation. Rail irregularities will increase the derailment 
coefficients, so a smooth rail can decrease these when a train moves across foundation 
settlements or rotations. The train derailment coefficients rise with the increase in train speed. 
The derailment coefficients may significantly increase when the train runs at a certain speed, 
because some wheels are disconnected from the rail for a long time. Thus, the best way to 
pass a settlement location in safety is to decrease the train speed. The time-history 
displacements at the train obviously contain jumps when the train passes a location with 
foundation settlements or rotations. When the displacement jump is much larger than the 
background displacements produced from the bridge impact deformation and rail 
irregularities, there should be a large foundation settlement, and a warning system can thus be 
established using this measurement.

Chapter 1. Introduction 
High-speed trains have become an important transportation facility in many countries. 
They are mainly used for passenger transport, so safety and comfort are the most important 
requirements. However, when a strong earthquake hits a train running at high speed, 
derailment becomes a serious threat. By chance, a recent example of derailment took place on 
March 4, 2010 in Tainan, Taiwan. The Jiasian earthquake led to the Taiwan High Speed Rail 
slightly derailing with fortunately no casualties in this accident (Fig.1.1 to Fig.1.3). Another 
derailment event was that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 occurred in Chuetsu region 
of Niigata Prefecture of Japan on October 23, 2004 at 17:56. The earthquake inflicted heavy 
damage to Kanetsu Expressway and Hokuriku Shinkansen Line and Joetsu railway line, and 
the Shinkansen train traveling at a speed of 200km/h was derailed (Fig.1.4). This project 
investigates the derailment of high-speed trains moving on multi-span simply supported 
bridges, which is the same as the current bridge system of the high-speed rail in Tainan area. 
A moving wheel finite element containing contact and separation modes was developed to 
simulate vehicle-bridge interaction problems under seismic loads. Rail irregularities and 
bridge-rail-train interactions were appropriately considered in the nonlinear finite element 
analysis. In particular, the reason of the derailment of the high-speed train during the 
Jiasian-earthquake in Taiwan on March 4, 2010 was examined and discussed. More details 
can be found in Chapter 5. 
  Another essential issue of the moving high-speed train is its safety problem due to 
foundation settlements, and finding the relationship between foundation settlements and train 
derailments is more and more important, but the related investigations are limited in literature. 
Thus, the second goal of this project is to investigate the derailment of trains moving on 
multi-span simply supported bridges with foundation settlements or rotations. Rail 
irregularities, train-track-bridge interactions, and wheel/rail separations were considered in 
the three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analysis. In this project, a number of figures 
showing the relationship between the train derailment coefficient and foundation settlement 
may give useful suggestions for the current problem of moving high-speed trains under 
foundation settlements. More details can be found in Chapter 4.  
   This project also investigates the characteristics of train and ground vibrations for moving 
high-speed trains, and the accuracy of point contact conpared with the surface contact is 
studied in details. Chapter 2 investigates the accuracy of the point contact scheme for trains 
moving on rails with irregularities. The advantages of this scheme are that it requires only 
linear analysis, a coarse mesh, and low CPU time. Two validations were performed in that 
chapter. Chapter 3 investigates the behavior of ground vibrations induced by trains moving on 
embankments using theoretical formulations, finite element analyses, and field experiments.

and 1  and 2  are frequencies that change the shape of )(rrG . If 1  is set to zero, 
equation (2.3) is the same as the power spectral density function in reference [9]. Thus, only 
2  and Ar are required in equation (2.3). If   is smaller than 2 , )(rrG  is 
approximately proportional to 1/ 2 ; otherwise )(rrG  is approximately proportional to 
1/ 4 . 
In this report, we performed field measurements and finite element analyses of a 
high-speed train running in the south of Taiwan for comparison. The rail irregularity had an 
amplitude of 2 mm per 20 m of the rail in the vertical and transverse directions of the rail, and 
irregularity parameters are shown in Table 2.1. Fig. 2.1 (a) shows the vertical PSD from the 
field measurements and simulation. The measured PSD was obtained using the actual rail 
vertical coordinate along the rail direction, and the simulation was calculated using equation 
(2.3) with the data in Table 2.1. This figure indicates that the data in Table 1 are good enough 
to simulate the rail irregularity near the location of our field experiments. Fig. 2.1 (b) shows 
the vertical rail irregularity profile from the simulation. The transverse rail irregularity is 
similar to the vertical one near our experimental region, so the in Table 2.1 was used for both 
directions.  For a train speed of 300 km/h using the data of Table 2.1, frequencies l  and 
u  equal to 0.08 and 20 rad/m, respectively, specify that the actual vibration frequencies 
covered a broad range between 1 and 265 Hz. Frequency 2  of 3 rad/m means that the 
major part of vibration (frequency<40 Hz) is approximately proportional to 1/ 2 .

wheel location in the moving wheel direction (X axis). For Hertzian contact theory, kr can be 
approximated as follows [11]: 
21 /
HHr kk   (2.7) 
where H  is the deformation between the wheel and rail, and kH is the constant Hertzian 
stiffness. Thus, equation (2.7) produces a nonlinear finite element analysis. To avoid this 
inconvenience, a constant kr with a considerably large value can be set to neglect the H  
effect. This is reasonable, since H  is often very small compared to the rail or train 
displacement. Moreover, the rail and wheel shapes are not exact as a uniform disk, which 
may cause inaccuracy using the standard Hertzin theory. In Section 4, we will study the error 
due to using a constant kr. 
 
2.3.2 Surface contact method 
The contact element modified from a node-to-line contact element [12] contains a 
contact node and a number of target nodes curved by a cubic spline, in which the contact 
node can move along the cubic spline. As shown in Fig. 2.2, when the contact simulation is at 
a certain time step of iteration n, the 3-node contact element tangent stiffness matrix is

master-node coordinates minus the coordinates of the spring-damper. If there is no master 
node connected to the spring-damper, Z  ,Y ,X  and  are zero. 
   In this study, the lumped mass is used, and each master node can contain three mass 
values and three moment of inertia values. If the node contains an acceleration or centrifugal 
force, one can add this inertia or centrifugal force to the node to model the acceleration or 
turning behavior.  
 
2.4 Accuracy of the wheel-rail point contact scheme with rail irregularities 
   A train wheel moving on a rail is a complicated contact problem. However, people often 
simplify it by using a point contact scheme without frictional forces to model it. Thus, we 
will investigate the accuracy of this scheme by comparing it with the surface contact method 
that models the actual wheel-rail contact behavior. Equation (2.1) shows that the rail 
irregularity rv is a combination of cosine functions with various frequencies. Thus, a single 
cosine function of equation (2.12) is used to model the rail irregularity. 
  )Vtcos(A)xcos(A)X(r ccccv   11  (2.12) 
where Ac is the irregularity amplitude, c  is the irregularity frequency, x is the coordinate in 
the rail direction, V is the constant wheel speed , and t is the time. For a mass moving on a 
rail with the above irregularity, the following equation can be obtained to avoid a separation 
between the mass and rail: 
gVA)]X(rmax[a ccvmaxv  22 +F/Mc (2.13)   
where g (9.8 m/s2) is the gravity constant, F is the vertical applied force to the mass, and Mc 
is the mass. 
As shown in Fig. 2.3, a wheel system passing a simply supported beam with five 
intermediate supports was analyzed using the point and surface contact methods. The 
thicknesses of the beam and wheel are both 0.1 m, and the mass density, Young’s modulus, 
and Poisson’s ratio of the wheel and beam are 7.8 T/m3, 2E8 kN/m2, and 0.25, respectively. 
The wheel radius is 0.2 m, the beam length is 3.96 m, and the beam depth is 0.2 m. The plane 
stress assumption is used in the finite element analysis. The wheel system contains a mass 
(Mc=6 T) and a wheel, which are connected by a spring-damper device (Kc=1000 kN/m and 
Cc=20 kN-s/m). The intermediate support contains a spring-damper (Kc=10000 kN/m and 
Cc=10 kN-s/m) with an interval of 0.66 m to model the rail system. Train speed V was set to 
15 m/s, and frequency c  was set to 5, 10, and 20 rad/m for the three cases, respectively. 
According to equation (2.3) under the assumption of F/Mc=g, Ac can be set to 32E-4, 8E-4, 
and 2E-4 m, respectively, for the three cases.  
   For the surface contact finite element model, the rail irregularity wave was modeled 
exactly in the mesh of the beam, as shown in Fig. 2.3. The contact elements were generated 
 11
schemes for the three cases. The mass center displacements are the absolute mass center 
displacements minus the absolute wheel center displacements. In this figure, solid and dashed 
lines overlap, which indicates that the results of the two schemes are almost identical. A small 
difference at early time steps is due to the wheel moving from the zero rotation sliding for the 
surface contact scheme, which made the frictional force large at those time steps. Otherwise, 
the wheel rotating without sliding has a small frictional force, which produces almost 
identical results for the two schemes. Another reason to cause the similarity of both schemes 
is because the contact region between the wheel and rail is significant small. If the 
irregularity wave length is smaller than the contact region, the two schemes will have a big 
difference, but this condition only occurs in the very high frequency range of the rail 
irregularity.  The above phenomenon seems like a common sense; however, without this 
precise validation, the accuracy of the point contact scheme is still doubtful by people. The 
major advantages of the point contact scheme are: (1) it only requires linear analysis, (2) a 
fine mesh is not necessary, and (3) CPU time is low. For example, a surface contact analysis 
of this section requires about 24 hours using a 3GHz Intel computer, but not more than 10 
seconds for the point contact analysis.        
We also performed elastic-plastic finite element analyses for the above three surface 
contact cases with a steel yield stress of 350 Mpa. However, the plastic region is significantly 
small, so that the elastic and elastic-plastic results are very similar and cannot have any 
difference as shown in Fig. 2.4. Thus, linear elastic analysis is suitable for trains moving on a 
rail with reasonable rail irregularities (without a separation between wheels and rails). Since 
the displacements between the mass and wheel centers for the point and surface contact 
schemes are almost identical, the total contact force between the wheel and rail of the two 
schemes should also be very similar. Therefore, one can use the total contact force from the 
point contact scheme to find the contact region or pressure according to Hertzian contact 
theory.  
 
2.5 Validation of the point contact scheme by experiments for train-induced vibrations 
This section uses field measurements to validate the accuracy of the wheel/rail point 
contact scheme applied to a complicated train-rail-bridge interaction problem. Our previous 
work compared the dynamic responses of finite element analyses and field experiments [13], 
but the rail model and its irregularity were not considered. This section considers them and 
compares the ground and train vibrations from experiments and finite element analyses.

Fig. 2.6 Bridge pier, piles, and beam dimensions. 
 
The rail is the JIS-60-kg type supported on the upper concrete bed with a support 
interval of 0.625 m in the rail direction (X-direction). The concrete slab system shown in Fig. 
2.6 includes a 19-cm-thick upper concrete bed for sustaining the rail, a 4.5-cm-thick 
cement-asphalt layer (CA layer) for cushion, and a 33-cm-thick bottom concrete bed for 
sustaining the track structure on the soil foundation. The Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio,

elements connected to the concrete slabs modeled by 8-node solid elements every 0.625 m in 
the X-direction using two spring elements (Krail=spring constant=2.5E5 kN/m in X, Y and Z 
directions) and the nodes along rails are the wheel target nodes of the train model. The nodes 
along the bottom surface of rail concrete slabs are slave nodes controlled by the nodes of the 
bridge beams. Thus, the bridge superstructure including rails, concrete slabs, AC layers, and 
bridge main beams are coupled together.

elements. The master node is arranged at the column center, and other nodes within this 2.8

 In field experiments, there were two measurement stations with distances of 3 and 100 
m, respectively, from the railroad centerline (Fig. 2.8). Each station with three velocity 
sensors were set up to measure X, Y, and Z vibration velocities with 512 measurements per 
second. For finite element analyses, two cases with different rail irregularity coefficients (Ar) 
were analyzed. The first case had Ar=0 that means a perfectly smooth rail, and the second 
case was the regular case (Ar=0.8E-7 m2 rad/m as shown in Table 2.1). Fig. 2.9 shows the 
experimental and finite element results of the vibrations on the moving train. Fig. 2.10 shows 
the experimental and finite element results at the two stations under a train speed of 300 km/h. 
We also measured the Y and Z vibration velocities on the moving train near the field 
measurement stations, and the velocity meters were installed at the floor center of the fourth 
train carriage under the train speed near 300 km/h. The two figures have the following 
features: 
(1) The accuracy of the finite element analysis is acceptable for vibrations in the free field 
and on the moving train. The Y direction vibrations have a larger error than those in other 
directions, which is due to the mechanical behavior of the rail in the Y direction being more 
complicated. The Y-direction vibration depends not only on the rail minor moment of inertia 
but also on its rotational inertia; moreover, the wheels contacting the two rails in the Y 
direction cannot be well simulated by the finite element model. This deviation of the 
Y-direction vibration is also found in the measurements on the train, because Fig. 9(a) shows 
that experimental measurements in the Y direction have a larger variation than those in the Z 
direction.

(the jump at point A of (b) is from the beam length of the simply supported bridges).

(2) The vibration on the train is highly influenced by rail irregularities. When the rail is 
perfectly smooth, the vibration on the train is smaller than 80 db, making the train appropriate 
for offices according to Table 2.2. At this condition, the only large vibration peak at point A 
of Fig. 9(b) is caused by the train passing each girder of the multi-simply supported bridges. 
However, with the actual rail irregularity of Table 2.1, the vibration is over 100 db, which 
cannot be classified using Table 3. Thus, to decrease the vibration on the train for comfortable 
travel, the rail should be as smooth as possible.     
Figure 10 shows that the train-induced ground vibrations are not greatly influenced by rail 
irregularities, and only vibrations higher than 10 Hz were obviously different in simulations 
with and without rail irregularities. The reason is because the low frequency vibrations of the 
bridge highly depend on its natural frequencies, especially the first one in each direction. 
Normally, these first natural frequencies in the X and Y directions of the bridge are smaller 
than 3 Hz, and that in the Z direction is smaller than 7 Hz, which may cause resonance of the 
trainload dominant frequencies and the bridge natural frequencies at low frequency vibrations. 
For the high frequency range, such as frequencies larger than 10 Hz, the rail irregularity 
effect cannot be ignored.      
2.6 Conclusions 
A simplified point contact scheme is often used to model the complicated contact 
behavior of a train wheel and a rail. The major advantages of this scheme are that it only 
requires linear analysis, a coarse mesh, and low CPU time. Thus, this study investigated the 
accuracy of this scheme by comparing it with the surface contact method that models the 
actual wheel-rail contact behavior. For the surface contact finite element model, the rail 
irregularity wave was modeled exactly in the mesh of the beam using plane stress 
isoparametric elements. The cubic spline contact elements were generated between the wheel 
rim and the beam top surface with a friction coefficient of 0.3. A very fine mesh was 
generated to exactly model the condition of a wheel moving on a rail. However, for the point 
contact scheme, the rail irregularity wave was modeled as the element force vector, so the 
mesh did not require the rail irregularity wave. The simply supported beam was modeled by 
only 12 two-node beam elements, and the wheel was modeled as a lumped mass. Both elastic 
and elastic-plastic finite element results indicate that the displacements at the beam and mass 
centers of the two schemes are almost identical. This is because the contact region and plastic 
zone between the wheel and rail are significant small. Thus, if the mechanical behavior 
within the contact region is not of interest, the point contact scheme is a good alternative, 
especially for a large scale finite element analysis.  
Experimental measurements were also used to validate the accuracy of the wheel/rail 
point contact scheme applied to a complicated train-rail-bridge interaction problem. The 
finite element model contained a high-speed train with 12 carriages, a rail and its support 
concrete slabs with CA layer, multi-simply supported beam, pile foundation system, and

approach to account for trenches close to a railroad by considering train-induced 
low-frequency ground vibrations. The ground is modeled as a layered semi-infinite domain 
and the embankment with finite layers, and no irregularities in rails or wheels were accounted 
for. Galvın and Domınguez [11] used a three-dimensional boundary element method /finite 
element method approach for the analysis of train induced vibrations. Experimental and 
numerical results at several points near the track were compared in their investigation. Gupta 
et al. [12] presents the experimental validation of a coupled periodic finite element-boundary 
element model for the prediction of subway induced vibrations. The model fully accounted 
for the dynamic interaction between the train, the track, the tunnel and the soil. 
Analyzing soil-train interaction problems, most of the researchers concentrated at the 
numerical modeling or experimental validation, and not many were focus on the behavior of 
train-induced ground vibrations. For example, to understand the major source and frequency 
range of train-induced ground vibrations still requires more researches, since they are very 
different under subsonic and supersonic train speeds. This study used theoretical formulations, 
finite element analyses, and field experiments to investigate the behavior of ground vibrations 
induced by trains moving on embankments. The vibration and frequency behaviors of rail 
irregularities under subsonic and supersonic train speeds will be adequately discussed and 
illustrated.  
 
3.2 Study of train-induced vibration behavior using Timoshenko beam theory 
Rail irregularities are one of the major sources of vibration for moving trains. In this 
section, a train passing over a Timoshenko beam [13] with rail irregularities was solved to 
investigate the train induced vibration. 
 
3.2.1 Rail irregularity 
A function )(Xrv  of the rail irregularity [14] was used in this study, and the formulation 
is mentioned in Section 2.2. In this report, we will perform field measurement and finite 
element analysis of a high-speed train running in the south of Taiwan. The rail irregularity has 
an amplitude of about 2 mm per 20 m of the rail. We used the irregularity parameters as 
shown in Table 3.2, and Fig. 3.1 shows the profile. These data were assumed for the rail on 
embankments and they are different from those of Section 2.2 for the rail on bridges.

used. In this study, 80 modes were used in the numerical analysis. 
The vehicle model can be several trains or dampers, springs, and mass with the zero velocity 
to model the soil or sleepers underneath the simply supported beam. The matrix equations of 
vehicles can be formed as follows:

where M, C, and K are the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, R is the vector of beam 
reaction forces at wheel locations, and X is the displacement vector. In this study, car bodies, 
bogies, and wheel-axis sets are assumed rigid, and the mass is lumped at the mass centers 
(master nodes). The vehicle is then modeled as the combination of Kelvin spring-damper 
devices and rigid links. For a spring or damper, whose upper and bottom sides are connected 
to two master nodes with the distances of Du and Db, the stiffness or damping matrix can be 
calculated as follows:

the damping matrix S, ][ buT DDB 11  . If there is no connection with a master node, 
Du or Db are zero. The mass matrix of equation (3.6) is diagonal with the lumped mass and 
the moment of inertia. For stiffness and damping matrices, all the matrices of equation (3.7) 
are added to find the global matrix of equation (3.6). Since the forces and displacements 
between the beam and wheels are coupled, we used the following procedures to solve this 
beam-vehicle problem.

Both figures show that the beam deflections are large at the frequencies of nV/Lc, where n 
is a positive integer, V is the train speed, and Lc is the carriage interval. Ju et al. [16] used 
field experiments and train load equations to indicate that nV/Lc are the dominant frequencies 
of moving trains, but the effect of rail irregularities was not discussed. In this study, the 
theoretical formulation under extremely large rail irregularities also shows the train-induced 
vibration has those dominant frequencies. To further explain this phenomenon, the wheel 
loads of a train passing a point, as shown in equation (3.1), were re-written as follows:

Fig. 3.4 shows the influence factors using equation (3.11) for the Japanese SKS-700

can be precisely predicted by nV/Lc, even though there are extremely large rail irregularities 
in the system. Many researches have discussed the dominant frequencies for moving trains, 
but why those dominant frequencies are still obvious under large rail irregularities of a board 
range of frequencies was not clearly illustrated in the literature.

mass. These components can be appropriately simulated using the above wheel and 
spring-damper elements. 
 
3.3.3 Finite element model 
The Newmark direct integration method and the consistent mass scheme were used to 
solve this problem with the solution scheme of the SSOR (Symmetric Successive 
Over-Relaxation) preconditioned conjugated gradient method [18]. The finite element model 
is 985 m long, 360 m wide and 150 m deep with the maximum solid element size of 2.5 m. 
The major part of the mesh is modeled by eight-node 3D solid elements for the soil and rail 
foundation. Rails are modeled by two-node 3D beam elements connected to the eight-node 
solid elements every 0.625 m in the X-direction using two spring elements (spring constant = 
2.5E5 kN/m), and the nodes along the rails are the wheel target nodes of the train model. 
Finally, the five surfaces, except for the top surface of the mesh, are modeled by the 
absorbing boundary condition [19]. Fig. 3.6 shows a typical 3D finite element mesh, which 
contains 9,861,576 degrees of freedom. The time step length is 0.005 seconds, and 3,000 time 
steps are simulated.

   To further validate the dominant frequencies of nV/Lc, all the three-direction particle 
velocities of the seven field measurements at the 100-m station were transformed to the 
frequency domain using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The train velocities were measured 
between two locations divided by the difference in the arrival times, and we also used the 
tenth dominant frequency (f10) to calibrate the train speed (V=Lcf10/10=2.5f10 m/s, where 
Lc=carriage interval=25 m). Fig. 3.8 shows the frequency-domain results, which were 
averaged from the seven experimental measurements in the three directions. This figure, 
directly obtained from experiments, indicates that the particle velocities are large at the 
frequencies of nV/Lc, even though the experiment location is 100 m away from the moving 
train.

3.3.5 Rail irregularities and layered soil effects for train speed under the soil Rayleigh speed 
   Since it is not easy to perform a parametric study for the effects of rail irregularities and 
layered soils using field experiments, we use finite element analyses to investigate these 
conditions. Five cases were analyzed, as follows: (1) a perfectly smooth rail (no rail 
 33
which is not easy to decay on the soil surface. If the soil profile is layered, the vibration 
reflected between soil layers will further cause a slow decay of the train-induced ground 
vibrations.  
     
(a) Case 1: No rail irregularity 
 
(b) Case 2: Ar=2.5E-6 m2 rad/m<Ar of line-grade-6 (very good case) 
 
(c) Case 3: Ar of line-grade-3 (poor case)

magnified by 3E6 times).

3.4 Train speed over soil Rayleigh speed with rail irregularity effect 
References [1,2,10,22,23] indicated that ground vibrations increase considerably and 
decay slowly when the train speed exceeds the soil Rayleigh speed (supersonic train speed). 
However, rail irregularities were not considered in their analyses. In this section, the effect of 
rail irregularities will be discussed when the train speed exceeds the soil Rayleigh speed. The 
soil is set to homogeneous with the Young’s modulus of 1E5 kN/m2, Poisson’s ratio of 0.48, 
and mass density of 2 t/m2, so the soil Rayleigh speed is 445 km/h. There are six cases with 
two train speeds of 500 and 600 km/h, and three rail irregularity coefficient Ar of 0 (perfectly 
smooth), 2.5E-6 (very good smoothness), and 68.16E-6 rad.m2/m (line grade 3 and poor 
smoothness). Other data and dimensions are the same as those in section 3.3. Fig. 3.11 shows 
the surface displacements of finite element analyses for Ar of 0 and 68.16E-6 rad.m2/m under 
the train speed of 500 km/h, and Fig. 3.12 and 3.13 shows the finite element results, which 
indicate the following features: 
(1) The vibration pattern is difficult to damp and is like the displacement compressed by the 
trainloads moving in the railway direction. Notably, the vibration at the first dominant 
frequency (V/Lc) is much higher than those of other frequencies. The reason is because 
the vibration decay is very slow when the train speed is faster than the soil Rayleigh 
speed, and the vibration of the first dominant frequency having the longest wave length is 
even more difficult to damp. 
(2) The ground vibrations with or without rail irregularities are not very different, and the 
cases with rail irregularities are only larger at high-frequency vibrations. When 
train-induced vibrations move away from the railway, the high-frequency vibrations will 
be damped fast, and the vibration at the first dominant frequency will be the most obvious, 
which means that the effect of rail irregularities is minor for train speeds over the soil 
Rayleigh speed. The train-induced vibrations under a very poor rail irregularity can be 
still dominant, but such a poor rail irregularity is almost impossible for the high-speed rail 
system. Thus, thick concrete slabs and soil improvement suggested by Ju and Lin [22] can 
still be used to efficiently reduce the ground vibration for moving trains with rail 
irregularities.   
(3) The vibrations in the vertical (Z) direction are obviously much larger than those in the 
other two directions, but this condition was not found for the train speed smaller than the 
soil Rayleigh speed (subsonic train speeds). This is because the rail irregularities are the 
major sources to produce ground vibrations for subsonic train speeds, and the vertical and 
transverse rail irregularities are often in a similar range (the same in this study), which 
causes similar vibration magnitudes in all three directions. However, for supersonic train 
speeds, the most important vibration source is the vertical trainload, so the largest 
vibration should be in that direction.

Chapter 4. Safety of high-speed trains moving on bridges during 
foundation settlements 
4.1. Introduction 
High-speed rail systems are mainly used for passenger transport, so safety and comfort 
are the most important requirements. However, when high-speed trains travel on a railway 
with foundation settlements, their safety becomes a serious problem. For this reason, finding 
the relationship between foundation settlements and train derailments is more and more 
important, but the related investigations are limited in literature. Mauer in 1995 [1] presented 
a dynamic settlement model to simulate track settlement behavior under rail traffic, and 
simulations of track settlement under various initial geometrical and parametrical conditions 
were described and discussed. Dahlberg in 2001 [2] used the finite element program 
LS-DYNA to simulate the long-term behavior of the track. He found that settlement will 
occur if the stresses in that element exceed the yield limit of the element material. In addition, 
'hanging sleepers' may be modeled and obtained as a result of track settlement. Liang et al. in 
2001 [3] indicated that track damage involves not only the failure in strength of components 
but also the overdeformation or intolerable settlement of the system below the track, so they 
investigated the interactions between the vehicle running quality and the subgrade design 
parameters. Lundqvist and Dahlberg in 2005 [4] presented a computer model by which the 
dynamic train/track interaction can be simulated, and examined the influence of one or 
several voided sleepers on the train/track interaction force and on the track dynamics, as well 
as the issue of track settlement due to hanging sleepers. Wong et al. in 2006 [5] measured the 
settlement and formation of piping holes on surfaces along a rail embankment subject to 
normal traffic load with piezometers installed in the native peat and soil underneath the 
embankment inside and outside problematic areas to measure the pore pressure responses 
during train traffic. Saussine et al. in 2006 [6] used a discrete element simulation to study 
behaviors related to the alteration of railway ballast after repeated train passing, and the 
numerical results for the settlement of a track submitted to 20,000 loading cycles or more 
were presented. Yau in 2009 [7] presented an incremental-iterative procedure to investigate 
the influence of ground settlement on the dynamic interactions of train-bridge system, and 
indicated that the inclusion of ground settlement is generally small on the bridge response, 
but it can drastically amplify the vertical response of a moving train, especially with a 
concave-up settlement profile. Yau in 2009 [8] investigated the dynamic response of a 
Maglev vehicle traveling over a series of guideway girders undergoing ground support 
settlement, and indicated that the increase in levitation gap for a Maglev vehicle may result in 
a larger vehicle response, but the response with a smaller gap will be significantly amplified 
at higher speeds once ground settlement appears at the guideway supports. 
Multi-span simply supported bridges are often built in city areas for high-speed trains.

4.3.1 Nonlinear finite element modeling of moving trains with the derailment effect 
The nonlinear wheel element contains a stiffness kr between the rail and wheel with the 
separation and contact modes. If the two target nodes and the wheel node are nodes 1, 3 and 2 
respectively, the three-node element stiffness for the nodal displacements (X1, 1 , X2, X3, 3 ) 
is:

where 1X , 1 , 3X  and 3 are the translations and rotations at target nodes 1 and 3, 2X  is

formulation above using a spring-mass (Fig. 4.1) moving on a rigid surface with the 
separation mode, where the mass is 1 t, the spring constant is 1104 kN/m, the mass speed is 
10 m/s, kr of equation (4.5) is set at 5105 kN/m, the gravity constant is assumed to be 10 
m/s2, and the applied force at the bottom of the spring is shown in Fig. 4.1. This problem can 
be solved using the theory of dynamics and vibration, as shown in the Appendix. The finite 
element model according to the formulation of Section 3.2 was analyzed using the average 
acceleration Newmark method with the time step lengths of 0.0001 s and 0.001 s for two 
cases. Fig. 4.2 shows the results of the finite element and theoretical methods, and this figure 
indicates that the two results are almost identical. This example thus demonstrates that the 
current finite element model can be used to simulate the separation and contact modes of the 
wheel/rail correctly.

4.5 Finite element results 
4.5.1 Derailment due to foundation settlements and rotations 
   This section studies the train derailment caused by the vertical settlements and rotations at 
the pier bottom. The vertical settlement angle (Vangle) is defined as  
Vangle=Vsettlement/Lspan (4.9) 
where Vsettlement is the vertical settlement at the bottom of the pier, and Lspan is the span length 
of simply supported beam. Fig. 4.4 shows the deformed bridges due to the vertical settlement 
of 6.5 cm (Vangle=0.00217 rad) at a pier bottom, and Fig. 4.5 shows the deformed bridges due 
to the X or Y rotation of 0.003 rad at the pier bottom. These figures indicate that the rail 
contains a sharp displacement between two simply supported girders, and this location may 
cause separations between the wheels and rails, which produce a large train derailment 
coefficient. 
 
 
 
 49
(2) Other than the locations between two girders, the derailment coefficients are significantly 
small, where the small oscillations (point E) shown in Fig. 4.6 are due to the supports of 
rails with the interval of 0.625 m. The small jumps (point A) of the derailment 
coefficients are generated from the train moving across the points between two girders, 
and these are independent of the settlements or rotations of the foundation. Moreover, 
they are much smaller than the critical derailment coefficient of 0.8.   
(3) The derailment coefficients increase when the foundation settlement or rotation increase, 
but the relationship is not linear. For the vertical settlement or Y rotation of the foundation, 
when they are larger than a certain value, such as 8-cm settlement (Vangle=0.00267 rad) or 
0.005-rad rotation, as shown in Fig. 4.7, the derailment coefficients will be greatly 
enlarged. This is because the separation distance between the wheels and rails is almost 2 
m, which causes the normal contact forces to approach zero. The derailment coefficient 
will thus be significantly increased according to equation (4.1). For the foundation X 
rotation, the curve is pretty smooth, and a rapid increase cannot be found. This is because 
the bridge girders are continuous in the Y direction, so that the sharp change in the rail 
displacements is not large at the locations between the two girders.      
(4) The rail irregularities will increase the derailment coefficients for trains across a 
foundation settlement or rotation. When the vertical settlements or rotations are small, 
such as when they are smaller than 3 cm (Vangle=0.001 rad) or 0.002 rad, as shown in Fig. 
4.7, the derailment coefficients may be dominated by the rail irregularities, and the effects 
of the foundation settlement and rotation are not obvious. However, the derailment 
condition is always worse when including rail irregularities. Thus, a smooth rail can 
decrease the derailment when a train moves across foundation settlements or rotations.  
 
    The above discussions indicate that the gaps between simply supported girders will 
cause serious problems when bridge foundations contain relative settlements, so one can 
decrease the eccentricity of the bridge girder shown in Fig. 4.3 (c) to reduce the train 
derailment coefficients at these locations. To validate this situation, a number of finite 
element analyses were performed under the vertical settlement of 6.5 cm without rail 
irregularities. Fig. 4.8 show the train derailment coefficients changing with the eccentricity of 
the bridge girder, which clearly validates the above phenomenon. In practice, the girder 
eccentricity for multi-span simply supported bridges cannot be avoided; however, a shortest 
length is suggested for the safety reason.

4.5.2 Effect of train speed 
  The change in the derailment coefficient with the train speed is investigated this section. 
The vertical settlement of 6.5 cm ((Vangle=0.00217 rad)) or the rotation of 0.003 rad at a pier 
bottom were set for the train speeds from 50 to 375 km/h. Fig. 4.9 shows the finite element 
results, which indicate the following features:  
(1) The train derailment coefficients rise with the increase of the train speed. This can be 
explained by using a sine function as )sin()sin( aVtAaxAz   for the settlement, where 
z is the vertical displacement, x is the position, V is the train speed, t is time, and a is a 
factor of the settlement shape. The acceleration is then )sin()( 22 aVtVAaza   . It is 
clear that the increase in train speed will cause greater acceleration of the train, which 
 53
time-history displacements at the train to estimate the actual vertical settlements of railway 
bridges. When a measured displacement range is much larger than the background 
displacements produced from the bridge impact deformation and rail irregularities, such as 2 
mm for the bridge system used in this report, there should be a large foundation settlement; 
thus, a warning system can be established using this measurement. For example, as shown in 
Fig. 4.11 (a), the derailment coefficients are not large for a foundation vertical settlement 
smaller than 1 cm but the carriage Z-displacement of 11 mm is obvious compared to the 
background range of 2 mm.    
(2) For the figure of the X-rotation at the pier bottom, the condition is similar to those of the 
foundation vertical settlement, but one should monitor the Y-displacements measured at the 
mass center of the carriage, and they are obvious for a small foundation Y-rotation. For 
example, as shown in Fig. 4.11 (b), the derailment coefficients are small for a foundation 
Y-rotation smaller than 0.002 rad, but the carriage Y-displacement of 17 mm are much larger 
than the background displacement of 3 mm.   
(3) For the figure of the Y-rotation at the pier bottom, the vertical displacements measured at 
the mass center of the train carriage are within the background range of 2 mm for a slightly 
large foundation Y-rotation. For example, the train vertical displacement due to the 
foundation X-rotation of 0.002 rad is 2.3 mm, which is similar to the background range of 2 
mm (due to rail irregularities). Nevertheless, Fig. 4.11 (c) shows that the measured vertical 
displacement ranges at the carriage mass center are still fairly larger than the background 
range of 2 mm when the foundation Y-rotation begins to cause unsafe condition, such as the 
foundation Y-rotation larger than 0.003 rad. For this reason, monitoring the train vertical 
displacement is still suitable to estimate a danger condition due to the foundation Y rotation.

Chapter 5. Nonlinear analysis of high-speed trains moving on bridges 
during earthquakes 
 
5.1 Introduction 
High-speed trains have become an important transportation facility in many countries. 
However, when a strong earthquake hits a train running at high speed, derailment becomes a 
serious threat. By chance, a recent example of derailment took place on March 4, 2010 in 
southern Taiwan. The Jiasian earthquake led to the Taiwan High Speed Rail slightly derailing 
with fortunately no casualties in this accident. Although the reasons for train derailment may 
be varied and complex, several studies have already considered this issue during seismic 
loads. Yang and Wu (2002) used three-dimensional (3D) train and bridge models to 
investigate the stability of trains initially resting on or travelling over bridges under different 
seismic excitations, with the effect of the track system taken into account [1]. Luo (2005) 
evaluated the dynamic response behavior of railway vehicles with a simplified analytical 
model and proposed a code-type provision based on the concept of energy balance, in which 
the spectral intensity is employed as an assessment index [2]. Based on the theory of dynamic 
wheel-rail interactions, Xia et al. (2006) established a dynamic model of coupled train-bridge 
system subjected to earthquakes, in which the non-uniform characteristics of 
the seismic wave input from different foundations were considered [3]. Kim and Kawatani 
(2006) investigated the seismic response of steel monorail bridges using 3D dynamic 
response analysis, and considered monorail bridge-train interaction when subjected to ground 
motions [4]. Yau and Fryba (2007) studied the vibration of a suspension bridge due to moving 
loads of equidistant, identical forces and shaken by vertical support motions caused by 
earthquake, and the suspension bridge was modeled as a single-span suspended beam [5]. 
Kim et al. (2007) investigated dynamic responses of the bridge for a straddle-type monorail 
subjected to ground motions. The validity of the equations of motion developed for a 
monorail train-bridge interaction system was verified by comparison with the field-test data 
[6]. Tanabe et al. (2008) used a finite element method to solve for the dynamic interaction of 
a high-speed train and railway structure during an earthquake [7]. A substructure model was 
devised to obtain the approximated combined motion of a long train with many cars and the 
railway structure during an earthquake. Fryba and Yau (2009) analyzed the vibration of 
suspension bridges subjected to the simultaneous action of moving loads and vertical support 
motions during an earthquake [8]. Nishimura et al. (2009) studied vehicle safety in terms of 
the dynamic stability and the possibility of derailment directly caused by the track excitations 
of earthquakes [9]. Through the analyses, four major outcomes for the train derailment were 
obtained. Fryba and Yau (2009) investigated the vibration of suspension bridges subjected to 
the simultaneous action of moving loads and vertical support motions due to earthquakes. 
The dynamic actions of traffic loads were modeled as a row of equidistant moving forces,

5.2.3 Nonlinear finite element modeling of moving trains with the derailment effect 
Different from our previous linear train formulations [11,14], this paper models trains as 
the combination of nonlinear wheel elements, visco-elastic spring-damper elements and 
lumped mass moving in the X direction. The Newton-Raphson method was used to solve the 
nonlinear finite element analysis. There are a number of nonlinear methods to perform 
moving train analyses [15, 16]. This study developed a simple nonlinear moving wheel 
element to deal with the contact and separation modes of the wheel and rail. The wheel 
element contains a stiffness kr between the rail and wheel. The separation and contact modes 
will be checked using the spring force between the wheel and rail. The formulations are exact 
 61
5.3.2 Finite element model 
The Newmark direct integration method and the consistent mass scheme are used to 
solve this problem with the solution scheme of the SSOR (Symmetric Successive 
Over-Relaxation) preconditioned conjugated gradient method [18]. The finite element model 
is 2070 m long with 69 simply supported bridges, as shown in Fig. 4.5. 
We use springs to model the rotation degrees of freedom for the foundation and soil, and 
the stiffness values as shown in equation (5.1) are calculated using soil-foundation interaction 
finite element analyses [14].

where x , y , and z  are rotations at pier bottom, and Mx, My, and Mz are the moments at 
pier bottom. Three translation degrees of freedom at the pier bottom are, then, applied to the 
seismic displacements, which are integrated using the ground accelerations of Fig. 5.1. As 
shown in Fig. 4.5, rails are modeled by two-node 3D beam elements connected to the 
concrete slabs modeled by eight-node solid elements every 0.625 m in the X-direction using 
two spring elements (Krail=spring constant=2.5E5 kN/m in X, Y and Z directions), and the 
nodes along rails are the wheel target nodes of the train model. The nodes along the bottom 
surface of rail concrete slabs are slave nodes controlled by the nodes of the 3D beams for the 
bridge girders. Thus, the bridge superstructure including rails, concrete slabs, AC layers, and 
bridge main beams are coupled together. The bearing plates of the simply supported beam are 
not located on the pier center, so the rigid beam system shown in Fig. 2.7 (c) is used to model 
this eccentricity equal to 1.25m wide. The time step length is 0.001 seconds with 24,000 time 
steps simulated. The computer memory and time requirements are about 2.6 GB and 2 days, 
respectively, using an Intel I7-950 personal computer. 
  
5.4 Finite element results 
5.4.1 Derailment due to rail irregularities and train speeds 
This section investigates the effect of the maximum derailment coefficients versus train 
speeds with or without rail irregularities using the seismic loads at the Xinhua station (EQ1). 
Moreover, the derailment event due to the Jiasian earthquake in Taiwan is also discussed. Fig. 
5.3 shows the maximum derailment coefficients of all the train wheelsets changing with time 
for the train speed equal to 300 km/h. The total maximum derailment coefficients are 
obtained from the maximum derailment coefficients for the entire time interval required for 
the train to pass through the finite element domain of 2000 m. Fifteen different train speeds 
from 50 to 400 km/h are examined with and without rail irregularities, as shown in Table 4.1.

frequency ( Vks   =constant), the increase of V will decrease k , and also cause a 
larger ak from equation (4.3). This, therefore, produces a larger rail irregularity (rv(X)), 
and the value is approximately proportional to V2 if we set Vsk /21    in 
equation (4.4). Thus, a higher train speed will produce a larger derailment coefficient. To 
overcome this condition, a smooth rail system should be built. 
(3) Without rail irregularities, the seismic load also causes that a higher train speed generates 
a larger derailment coefficient, which is very similar to that in discussion (1). This is 
because the seismic loads cause horizontal and vertical vibrations of the bridge girder, 
which are similar to a special type of rail irregularities. Thus, the two conditions, only rail 
irregularities and only seismic loads, have similar derailment behavior for the train speed. 
For example, if the bridge girder vibrates following a certain mode as 
)L/Vtnsin()L/xnsin(z  , where z is the horizontal or vertical displacement, x is 
the position measured from the beginning of the girder, V is the train speed, t is time, n is 
the mode number, and L is the girder length. Then, the acceleration is 
)L/Vtsin()L/Vn(za 222   . It is clear that the increase in train speed will cause a 
larger acceleration of the train, which causes larger a train derailment coefficient.      
(4) With the combination of the seismic load and rail irregularities, the trend of the 
derailment coefficient changing with train speed is still similar to these seen with only the 
seismic load or only rail irregularities. Generally, the derailment coefficients are enlarged 
with the increase in train speed. When the train speed is over 350 km/h, the derailment 
coefficients are greatly increased. This is because a certain rail is almost disconnected 
from the wheel during a moving distance of 2 m, and they can be fully separated during a 
certain moving distance of 2 m for a very fast train speed, such as 500 km/h.

case 2: only Y and Z seismic loads) 
 
   To study the above critical condition of the gaps in simply supported bridges again, the 
finite element mesh for a multi-span continuous bridge was generated, in which the bridge 
material properties and dimensions are the same as those of the multi-span simply supported 
bridge, but all the spans are continuous without gaps, and a hinge support is arranged at the 
centerline of each pier. Fig. 5.8 shows the bridge deformation at the time of 12 s, which 
indicates that the X-direction deformation is smooth without caps. Fig. 5.9 shows the 
maximum derailment coefficient changing with time for the two bridge types, where 
three-direction earthquake shown in Fig. 5.1 (a-c) was applied without rail irregularities. This 
figure indicates that the train derailment coefficient of the continuous bridge is smaller than 
that of simply supported bridge, and it is similar to that of simply supported bridge without 
the X-direction earthquake (Fig. 5.7). This conclusion further validates the disadvantage of 
the safety for the gaps in a simply supported bridge.

Xinhua station (EQ1) and Shanhua station (EQ2) without rail irregularities 
 
Fig. 5.11 Y-direction accelerations at the center of the bridge girder under the seismic loads 
at Xinhua (EQ1) and Shanhua (EQ2) stations without rail irregularities 
Fig. 5.4 shows that the coefficient has a peak at the train speed of 200 km/h. This is 
because the trainload at frequencies 3V/L (V=190-200 km/h=train speed and L is the interval 
of two train carriages) is near the elevated railway vertical natural frequency of 6.3 Hz. 
Vertical resonance, thus, occurs, which causes a large vibration of the bridge girder, and then 
increases the derailment coefficient. The large bridge vibration during the train speed of 
190-200 km/h can also be found in the field experiment of reference [19] near the same 
location of the derailment accident.    
 
5.5 Conclusions 
(1) This study developed a nonlinear moving wheel finite element to simulate vehicle-bridge 
interaction problems under seismic loads, where car bodies, bogies, wheel-axis sets, springs 
and dampers are modeled by assembling moving wheel elements, spring-damper elements, 
lumped mass and rigid link effects. The moving wheel element contains the separation mode, 
which can be used to simulate the non-contact behavior of the wheels and rails during 
earthquakes. The theory and formulations of this vehicle model are simple and can be added 
to standard dynamic finite element codes without difficulty. Additionally, rail irregularities,

finite element procedures and examines the derailment of the train during severe earthquake.  
 
6.2 Models of train, rail irregularity and derailment 
6.2.1 Train model 
We set the rail direction in the X axis, the earthquake direction in the Y axis, and the negative 
gravity direction in the Z axis. Moving trains are modeled as a combination of moving wheel 
elements, spring-damper elements, lumped mass, and rigid links. The wheel element contains 
a stiffness kr between the rail and wheel in the X, Y, or Z direction [9]. The formulations are 
the same as those mentioned in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.3. It is noted that the finite element 
analysis of this chapter is linear elastic, and the separation mode of the wheel/rail is not 
included. This is because the finite element mesh is too large to perform the nonlinear 
analysis. 
Fig. 2.5 shows the 3D model of the SKS-700 high-speed train, which contains 
spring-dampers, rigid bodies and lumped masses. The stiffness kr between wheel and rail was 
set to 3×105 kN/m. These components can be appropriately simulated using the above wheel 
and spring-damper elements.  
 
6.2.2 Rail irregularity 
A function )(Xrv  of the rail irregularity [15] was used in this study. The formulation is 
mentioned in Section 2.2. The rail irregularity has an amplitude of about 2 mm per 20 m of 
the rail. We used the irregularity parameters as shown in Table 3.2, and Fig. 3.1 shows the 
profile. These data were assumed for the rail on embankments and they are different from 
those of Section 2.2 for the rail on bridges.  
  
6.2.3 Train derailment  
The phenomenon of wheel flange climbing over the rail is an important safety criterion of 
railway vehicles. There are two major variables which govern the derailment during the 
flange climb process. One is the ratio of wheelset horizontal (lateral) force Q and vertical 
force P, and the other is the wheel moving duration of the time or distance. Here, we 
introduced two main flange climb safety criteria: (1) Q/P time duration criterion: proposed by 
Japanese National Railways, and (2) wheel climb distance criterion: proposed by 
Transportation Technology Center, Inc. [11]. In this report, the maximum wheel derailment 
coefficient (Q/P) from all the wheelsets of a train is calculated as follows [12] (Jun and 
Qingyuan, 2005): 
Q/P=Max(Qi/Pi), i=1,n (6.1) 
where Qi and Pi are the horizontal and vertical forces of the ith wheelset, and n means the total 
number of wheelsets for the train.  
The specification standards for derailment prevention in various countries are: (1)

6.3.2 Absorbing boundary conditions  
For infinite soil medium, there has been developed several time-domain boundary 
methods including viscous boundary [15], absorbing boundary [16], and the perfect matching 
layer method [17]. In this report, absorbing boundary condition was used along the finite 
element boundaries to avoid fake wave reflection in equation (6.2).

6.3.3 Embankment dimensions and soil properties 
The report studied the behavior of trains moving on embankments, as shown in Fig. 6.3, 
under seismic loading. The rails are supported on a concrete slab system, with a 19-cm-thick 
upper concrete bed for sustaining the rail, a 4.5-cm-thick cement-asphalt layer (CA layer) for 
cushioning, and a 33-cm-thick bottom concrete bed for sustaining the track structure on the 
soil foundation. The rail is the JIS-60-kg type supported on the upper concrete bed with a 
support interval of 0.625 m in the rail direction (X-direction). The Young’s modulus, 
Poisson’s ratio and mass density for the concrete bed are 2×107 kN/m2, 0.15, and 2.4 t/m3, 
while those for the cement-asphalt layer are 0.6×106 kN/m2, 0.25, and 1.6 t/m3, and those for 
the rail are 2×108 kN/m2, 0.3, and 7.85 t/m3, respectively.

For the boundary condition of the mesh, the four surfaces, except for the top and bottom 
surfaces of the mesh, are modeled by the absorbing boundary condition [16], so that the 
vibration passing these mesh boundaries will not be reflected. Along the soil surface, all the 
nodes are free to move, and along the bottom of the mesh where the hard soil layer is located, 
the vertical degrees of freedom of all the nodes are, then, fixed. The time-history of the 
earthquake accelerations, as shown in Fig. 6.1, then were integrated to obtain the nodal 
displacements. These nodal displacements were applied to the nodes in the Y direction along 
the mesh bottom, which means that an earthquake is applied to the problem domain in the Y

irregularities completely, the train speed should thus be limited due to safety.

seismic excitation) 
 
6.5.2 Earthquake effect 
6.5.2.1 Derailment due to earthquake types and PGA 
This section investigates the variation of the derailment coefficient due to different seismic 
loadings. It is not really possible to directly scale quakes by only changing accelerograms or 
frequencies. However, if we changed both frequencies and accelerograms, the modified 
earthquake becomes a new one, which causes difficulty of the parametric study. Thus, we 
only change one term at once in this section.  A mentioned in section 3.1, three different 
earthquakes were analyzed, the train speed was set to 300 km/h, and the rail irregularities in 
Table 3.2 were used in finite element analyses. Fig. 6.6 shows the maximum derailment 
coefficient of all the train wheelsets changing with time during the three earthquakes. To 
understand the combined effect of rail irregularities and seismic loading, Fig. 6.6 (d) shows 
the results during earthquake 2 without rail irregularities. Thus, we can compare it with Fig. 
6.6 (b) that contains rail irregularities.

that the three earthquakes dominant frequencies are quite different. Obviously, the 
lowest-frequency earthquake causes the largest derailment coefficient, while the reverse 
is true for the highest-frequency earthquake. The first natural frequencies of the train 
carriage in the lateral and vertical directions are 0.6 and 0.5 Hz, respectively, which are in 
the low frequency range. Thus, the resonance between the train and earthquake increases 
the train vibration, which causes a larger derailment coefficient.  
(3) The first natural frequencies of the train are often smaller than 1 Hz, which means that an 
earthquake with dominant frequencies below 1 Hz may cause resonance between the 
moving train and seismic loading. A region with soft soil will usually cause the seismic 
loading to approach the low frequency range when an earthquake passes through. This 
condition makes the situation even worse, since the vibration behavior of seismic waves 
will be also enlarged when they pass through soft soil. This phenomenon was also found 
experimentally in reference [25].  
(4) If all the structural behaviors are linear elastic under a certain earthquake loading, the 
maximum derailment coefficients are quite linear in proportion to the PGA of the 
earthquake, as shown in Fig. 6.7. When the earthquake is significantly small, the 
maximum derailment coefficients will be dominated by the rail irregularities, but the 
coefficients are gradually linear in proportion to the PGA of earthquake when it increases. 
It is noted that this study only performed linear finite element analyses. For a large scale 
earthquake, the nonlinear behavior of rails and soils may produce a worse condition with 
regard to train derailment.   
 
Fig. 6.7 Maximum derailment coefficients during the 20-second earthquake loading changing 
with the maximum earthquake acceleration 
 
This section studies the resonance effect between the train and seismic load under an 
equal earthquake PGA. Changing soil properties can vary the ground motion, so they were 
constant for the above investigation. We performed another two finite element analyses under 
earthquake 2 (Fig 3.1) without rail irregularities, when the Young’s modulus of the 
embankment soil is reduced or magnified three times. The derailment coefficients of the three

6.6 Conclusions 
(1) To simulate the derailment of trains moving on embankments under the seismic loading, 
the soil profile cannot be ignored. Generally, using the time-domain finite element method to 
simulate the 3D unbounded wave problem produces a large number of degrees of freedom. 
Moreover, the wave will be reflected along the mesh boundary only if the traditional finite 
element method is used. However, this study overcame these obstacles in order to simulate 
the derailment of trains due to earthquakes. First, trains, including car bodies, bogies, 
wheel-axis sets, springs, and dampers, are modeled by assembling moving wheel elements, 
spring-damper elements, lumped masses, and rigid links. Then, a finite element mesh 
including rails, embankment foundation, and soil was generated using the traditional 
two-node beam elements and 3D 8-node isoparametric elements. For the boundary condition 
of the mesh, the four surfaces except for the top and bottom were modeled by the absorbing 
boundary condition to avoid fake wave reflection. Along the bottom of the mesh, the 
time-history of the earthquake displacements were applied to the nodes in the Y direction. 
Using the above scheme, Newmark’s method can be used with the efficient solution scheme, 
the SSOR preconditioned conjugated gradient method, to perform the dynamic finite element 
analysis, which is exactly the same as the traditional time-domain finite element analysis. 
(2) For the case of a perfectly smooth rail, the derailment coefficients of train wheelsets are 
near zero, and they are almost independent of train speeds. However, with minor rail 
irregularities, the derailment coefficients of train wheelsets are highly dependent on train 
speeds, and faster trains will cause larger derailment coefficients, and it thus seems that the 
coefficient increases with train speed in more than a linear relationship. Thus, to decrease the 
derailment of moving trains, the rail should be as smooth as possible. However since it is 
impossible to avoid rail irregularities completely, the train speed should be limitated due to 
safety. 
(3) This study shows that the resonance between the train and earthquake plays an important 
role in train derailment. The first natural frequencies of the train are often smaller than 1 Hz, 
which means that an earthquake with dominant frequencies below 1 Hz may cause resonance 
between the moving train and seismic loading. Furthermore, the maximum derailment 
coefficients are relatively linear proportional to the PGA of the earthquake, if the structural 
behaviors are not nonlinear.   
(4) Without rail irregularities, the train derailment coefficient due to the seismic loading is 
almost independent of the train speed, but it is highly dependent on the train speed when rail 
irregularities are included. Moreover, the combined effect of rail irregularities and seismic 
loading can not be ignored, so to investigate train derailment under seismic loading without 
considering rail irregularities is of little practical use.
