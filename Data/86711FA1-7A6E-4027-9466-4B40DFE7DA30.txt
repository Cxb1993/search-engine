近年來印刷產業隨著科技的進步，複製出高品質的印刷品乃是一
大趨勢。在國內印刷品質不夠穩定是拓展外銷市場最大的阻力，而穩
定的印刷製程即是品質提升的首要目標，如能在正式印刷前檢測出印
刷製程是否平順，既能夠節省成本的浪費，又能回饋至印刷廠檢討並
改進印刷過程的缺失，進而達到平穩的印刷製程以追求更好的印刷品
質。四色版（K、C、M、Y）之階調擴增值百分比（TVI Ratio）趨為
一個常數，此理論前提為印刷製程必須為一定程度上之穩定水準，因
此階調擴增值百分比也可以成為檢查印刷製程是否平穩之重要指標。
但提出此理論的學者 Stanton 和Hutton，於 1999 年之研究報告“An 
Analysis of Sheetfed Lithographic Print Attributes”中並沒有在多種製程
或多種材料下進行實驗，因此本研究即設定多種製程及多種材料下探
討四色階調擴增值百分比（50：75 和 50：25）是否趨於常數，並探討
其值與滿版濃度、印刷對比有無相關性。本研究採用真實驗研究設計
（True Experimental Designs），分為兩階段的實驗：第一階段旨在運用
各種印刷製程（傳統平版、複合式平版、傳統柔版、複合式柔版、無
水平版、網版、數位印刷）印刷於各類被印材（塗布紙、非塗布紙、
塑膠薄膜、PP 合成紙、綠背紙、光碟）上，以求出K、C、M、Y 四
色版階調擴增值百分比，並分析其間是否有差異，再訂定目標值（Target 
Value）與寬容度（Tolerance）；第二階段為從第一階段之各項製程與被
印材料中排出四色階調擴增值百分比有趨於常數之組合再次上機印刷
實驗，為增加樣本數以求取更高的研究效信度，藉由實驗比較相同印
刷製程於不同被印材上之階調擴增值百分比，以及比較不同印刷製程
下相同被印材料之階調擴增值百分比，最後分別探討階調值擴增百分
比與滿版濃度、印刷對比是否有相關，若有，則找出其關係式以提供
給印刷業者多一個快速而方便之印刷品質監控的依據，最後將結果彙
整提出階調值擴增百分比規格貢獻給國內印刷產業，進而達到穩定的
印刷過程追求更好的印刷品質，為台灣印刷業界之外銷市場開拓新的
疆土。 
可利用之產業 
及 
可開發之產品 
藉由多製程、多材料、多樣本及無套用任何階調補償曲線之結
果可推斷無論何種印刷製程印刷於何類被印材，並無四色版之階調
擴增值百分比趨於一常數之印刷適性。於第二階段則發現在同印刷
製程不同印刷材料時有趨於一個常數之組合，為數位印刷印製
PVC、PP、GB 和帆布之 K 色 50：75 階調擴增百分比無顯著差異，
趨於常數 1.3202；M 色 50：75 階調擴增百分比無顯著差異，趨於
常數 1.2113。而在不同印刷製程同被印材料之情況時，傳統平版與
複合式平版印製塗布紙之四色版 50：25 階調擴增百分比分別趨於
一個常數，K、C、M、Y 版分別為 1.2715、1.4059、1.2985 及 1.4040。
除此之外傳統平版與複合式平版印製非塗布紙之四色版 50：75 階
調擴增百分比也分別趨於一個常數，K、C、M、Y 版分別為 1.6300、
1.5234、1.4774 及 1.6454。 
針對以上組合分別對其滿版濃度與印刷對比做相關性分析
（Correlation），以了解階調擴增百分比是否與滿版濃度與印刷對比
有線性或非線性關係，進而執行迴歸分析得到關係式。 
根據相關性分析，得到與滿版濃度或印刷對比有相關性之組

An Experimental Study of Tone Value Increase Ratios on Various 
Printing Combinations 
Yung-Cheng Hsieh1; Hui-Wen Cheng2; Cheng3, Yuan-Hao; Chen, Shu-Yu4 
Keywords: Tone Value Increase, Lithography, Flexography, Digital Printing, Screen Printing, 
Waterless Lithography 
Abstract: Stanton and Hutton, who proposed the theory that Tone Value Increase Ratios (TVI Ratios) 
of CMYK four colors tend to be a constant, did not conduct experiments with different printing 
processes or with different substrates in their 1999 research paper titled "An Analysis of Sheetfed 
Lithographic Print Attributes." Based on True Experimental Designs and with various printing 
processes covering conventional lithography, hybrid lithography, conventional flexography, hybrid 
flexography, waterless lithography, screen printing and digital printing, this study conducts printing 
experiments on different substrates including coated paper, uncoated paper, PVC substrate, PP 
synthetic, (PP) paper, greenback (GB) paper, canvas and compact disc for calculation of TVI Ratios of 
four-color (C, M, Y, K) printing and analysis of differences among different combinations. Results of the 
study show that TVI Ratios of different substrates with the same printing process tend to be to a constant. For 
example, the TVI Ratio of 50:75 for PVC for black digital printing is 1.3127; for GB, 1.3020; for PP, 
1.3307; for canvas, 1.3353; all converging to a constant. On the other hand, the same has been found 
when printing on the same substrate with different printing processes, i.e. when printing on coated 
paper, the TVI ratios of 50:25 for conventional lithography is 1.2490 while for hybrid lithography it is 
1.2940. It is therefore reasonable to infer that same can also be observed at the TVI ratios of 50:25 and 
50:75 when printing on the same substrate with different printing processes or when printing on 
different substrate with the same printing processes. Further studies focused on TVI Ratio differences 
between same printing processes against different substrates as well as TVI Ratio differences between 
same substrate against different printing processes and further analyses on correlations with Solid Ink 
Densities and Print Contrast are suggested to follow-up studies aiming at identification of possible 
relations or prediction model for the printing industry as basis of quality control.

1.3 Significance of this research  
Printing industries in Asia has exhibited rapid growth in recent years with an average annual growth 
rate of 7~8% while the global figure is 3~4%. Worldwide annual consumption on printing per capita is
€48, while the same numeral in Asia is €8 except for Japan. As figures speak for themselves, based 
on a population of 3.9 billion, or 60% in the world, a sharp rise in Asian printing industries is not a 
slogan but just around the corner. (Chen, Zheng Xiong 2007) 
Printing industries in Taiwan has always been local-market-oriented. The increase in capacity leads to 
nothing but fierce price competition when the market does not expand appropriately. To find outlets for 
the excess of capacity, the industry has had a clear understanding of the importance of export market 
development because failing to open up export market may jeopardize the business. However, only 
limited accomplishment has been achieved due to some weaknesses exist in local printing industries 
including high material and labor cost, elusiveness of market information and lack of international 
trade professionals specialized in printing industry. Apart from these is the instability of printing quality 
which is one of the greatest obstacles in export market development. It will be difficult to compete with 
overseas printing companies if printing quality does not reach international standard. (Hsieh, 2003) 
Under such circumstances, a set of easy-to-use printing quality reference with representativeness are 
helpful for the local industries to improve their quality and make breakthroughs in overseas markets. If 
the TVI Ratios of four-color with different printing processes and diverse substrates studied in this 
research based on large-sized random sampling can be found converging to a constant, it will be a good 
reference in determining printing quality. 
Capability, a term to describe whether or not stability in printing processes can be maintained, has 
gradually been attached great importance to by the local printing industries in recent years. Among 
complicated processes, how to improve capability so as to enhance printing quality and customer 
satisfaction is not only a foremost goal pursued by major printing companies but a primary issue for the 
whole industry. As mentioned in "A Proposal for Sheetfed Offset Print Specifications" published by 
Stanton and Hutton of GATF (2000), the premise for TVI Ratios to converge to a constant is that a 
stable standard has to be maintained throughout printing processes. Hence, stability of TVI Ratios can 
also be an index for stability in printing processes. Nevertheless, Stanton and Hutton conducted their 
study only on coated paper with sheetfed offset print, not on diverse substrates with different printing 
processes. Still, the sample size in their study was not large enough. Therefore, whether their theory 
can be applied to the printing industry as a quality control reference needs further studies. 
In view of the background given above, in order to have an in-depth investigation into preliminary 
results discovered by previous researchers, this research conducts a study on seven printing processes 
(digital printing, conventional lithography, conventional flexography, hybrid lithography, hybrid 
flexography, screen printing and waterless lithography) and seven substrates (coated paper, uncoated

1.5 Research assumptions and limitations 
1. Printing houses participating in this research are carefully selected by the research team but not 
randomly picked.  
2. GATF's (Graphic Arts Technical Foundation) Digital Test Form Version 5.0 is used with 
modifications in this study. 
3. Solid Ink Densities in this study are set as follows; specifications in General Requirements for 
Applications in Commercial Offset Lithography (GRACoL) are followed in lithography; 
specifications in Flexographic Image Reproduction Specifications & Tolerances (FIRST) are 
followed in flexography; standards used by printing houses are followed in digital printing, 
screen printing and waterless lithography. 
4. Specifications of printing plates, printing blankets, damping solution and other printing material 
and facilities are not to be uniformed in this study but adhere to standards used by respective 
printing houses. Effects on the study are neglected. 
5. Room temperatures and relative humidity in the printing house adhere to standards used by 
respective printing houses. Effects on the study are neglected. 
6. Different printing combinations are processed by different printing houses with printing presses 
and proofing presses of different brands, different ages, specifications and physical conditions. 
Effects of such variables are neglected. 
7. Paper used by different printing houses may be of different brands, types, basis weights and basic 
sizes. Brands of other substrates are not regulated either. But basis weight of paper used is set 
between 100 lb to 175 lb in principle. Brands and types of the ink used in this study are the same 
as those used by respective printing houses in routines. Effects of these variables are neglected. 
8. Printing houses are requested not to apply any tone compensation curves in plate making. 
9. Measurement instruments used in this study, such as GretagMacbeth Eye-One iO 
Spectrophotometer and X-Rite530 Spectrodensitometer have all been launched and sold in 
international markets by manufacturers. The reliability and validity of these instruments have 
been confirmed by both academic and industrial circles and not to be discussed in this study. 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Printing quality 
In printing, Tone Value Increase refers to the difference in dot area between film and plate or between 
film and paper. TVI may occur at color separation, film exposure, plate developing and ink transfer 
from printing presses to the paper. Such changes of area are inevitable in printing processes that 
involve ink carry and transfer. In lithography, TVI has been confirmed a key factor influencing printing 
quality. (Hsieh, 1997)  It would be beneficial to a print house to understand the types, causes,

relation exhibit between TVI Ratio at 50% and TVI Ratio at 75% (the quotient derived from TVI Ratio 
at 75% divided by TVI Ratio at 50%) at all colors, LPI and paper types. A similar constant relation also 
exhibits between TVI Ratio at 50% and TVI Ratio at 25% at all colors, LPI and paper types. Table 1 
shows the average ratios between TVI at 50% and TVI at 75%. Table 2 shows the average ratios 
between TVI at 50% and TVI at 25%. An error of 0.1 in the ratio will generally result in 1% error in 
75% or 25% TVI ratios. As indicated in Table 1, the 50:75 TVI Ratios in all four colors are very similar, 
with errors less than 0.1. Another point worth mentioning is that the consistence also exists among 
different types of paper. Average 50:75 and 50:25 TVI Ratios listed in Table 1 and Table 2 indicate that 
for all types of paper, LPI and ink color, TVI@50%/TVI@75% converge to 1.51 while 
TVI@50%/TVI@25% converge to 1.28. Based on such findings, once a correct 50% TVI is given, the 
corresponding 75% TVI can be worked out from the 50:75 TVI Ratios and the corresponding 25% TVI 
can be worked out from the 50:25 TVI Ratios. In most cases, actual 75% or 25% TVI in lithographic 
printing shall fall within 2% deviation from the calculations. (Stanton et al, 1999)

Table 2 indicates that 50:25 TVI Ratios on coated paper at Y and C tend to be higher than the overall 
average. Judging from the fact that mean errors at Y, M, C, K and paper types are all within the 0.1 
deviation, Stanton and Hutton are of the opinion that errors of coated paper may level down sample 
value. (Stanton and Hutton, 1999)

calibrated before measurement. Measuring dot areas after output with a densitometer is also a 
key procedure to avoid tone value increase during output and verify linearization of the 
imagesetter to achieve stable printing processes. 
4. GretagMacbeth IC-PlateⅡPlate Scope 
GretagMacbeth IC-PlateⅡ Plate Scope is used to analyze dot areas, screen rulings and screen 
angles of conventional PS plates, CTP plates, positive/negative working lithographic plates and 
AM/FM screens. The device in this study is for measuring dot areas in lithographic plates to 
avoid tone value increase. 
3.4 Experiment samples 
Printers participating in the study are selected based on the printing quality and processes they 
specialized in. They are high quality commercial printers in Taiwan. The criteria for selecting the 
participants in this study as high quality were: printers were active member companies of PIT (Printing 
Industry of Taiwan) or PTRI (Printing Technology Research Institute); they established themselves as 
commercially successful printers; and they were quality-conscious enough to have invested 
considerable time, materials, and effort in participating in this study without monetary compensation. 
As for sampling, the population size for each printing processes is 1000 sheets, i.e., each participating 
printer was asked to print 1000 copies of the test form provided by the research team, and 50 
experimental sheets are sampled by systematic random sampling. After 50 experimental samples have 
been picked, densities of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of K, C, M, Y four colors in each sample are 
measured with GretagMacbeth Eye-One iO Spectrophotometer. TVI Ratios of 50:25 and 50:75 are then 
obtained through calculation in Microsoft Office Excel 2007. The substrate of compact disc is 
measured with X-Rite530 Spectrodensitometer. The parameter n is set at n=1.14 (Hsieh, 2002). Data 
obtained are collected and recorded for follow-up analyses.  
3.5 Analyses 
Data collected and recorded are then analyzed with SPSS 14.0 and Minitab 14.0 to identify differences, 
if any, among TVI Ratios of four colors. Items analyzed are listed hereunder: 
1. TVI Ratios L75 and L25 of CMYK color on PVC, PP, GB and canvas with digital printing. 
2. TVI Ratios L75 and L25 of CMYK color on coated paper and uncoated paper with conventional 
lithography. 
3. TVI Ratios L75 and L25 of CMYK color on coated paper, uncoated paper and PVC with 
conventional flexography. 
4. TVI Ratios L75 and L25 of CMYK color on coated paper and uncoated paper with hybrid 
lithography.

As shown in Figure 3, GATF's (Graphic Arts Technical Foundation) Digital Test Form Version 5.0 with 
modifications is the test form used in this study of dimensions 28×45(cm) for all the substrates other 
than compact discs. 
 
Figure 3. Test form used in this study 
Since substrates used in the study include compact discs for waterless lithography and screen printing, 
a special test form is designed to fit the size of 8.27×11.7 (inch). The special design for compact disc 
printing includes C, Y, M, K test forms and images for verification of color performance. Refer to

4. Printing 
Printing with different processes on various substrates is conducted after platemaking is completed. 
Coated paper and uncoated paper are then printed with conventional and hybrid lithography. Coated 
paper, uncoated paper and PVC are printed with conventional and hybrid flexography. Compact discs 
are printed with waterless lithography and screen printing. PVC, PP, GB and canvas are printed with 
digital printing. Printing conditions and operation environment follow printers' standard operational 
production settings with test runs prior to actual printings. 
Printing conditions and operation environment settings for flexography follow Flexographic Image 
Reproduction Specifications & Tolerances (FIRST) stipulated in Basic Requirements for International 
Design and Graphic Solutions (BRIDGS') General Printing Guidelines, 2007 issued by Flexographic 
Technical Association (FTA). Actual experimental printing were conducted with narrow sheetfed

6. Measurement and statistics 
Sampling stage was followed by measurement with GretagMacbeth Eye-One iO Spectrophotometer to 
generate various density data. Data obtained were input to a TVI conversion equation in Microsoft 
Office Excel for calculation of the TVI values at 25%, 50% and 75%. TVI values were then entered to 
SPSS 14.0 and Minitab14.0 to produce TVI Ratios of 50:25 and 50:75. Compact discs were measured 
by X-Rite530 Spectrodensitometer. The TVI values obtained were also recorded to statistical software 
for calculation of TVI Ratios of 50:25 and 50:75. TVI Ratios were then analyzed with One-way 
Analysis of Variance (one-way ANOVA) and Independent Sample T Test to identify whether significant 
differences exist, if any, of K, C, M, Y TVI Ratios among different printing processes and various 
substrates, and verify whether or not TVI Ratios converge to a constant. ANOVA level of significance 
(α) in this study is set at 0.05, or, whether they are significantly associated within a confidence 
interval of 95%.
