today. In order to sustain or even to improve the profitability and competitive advantage, it is 
very critical for technology-driven companies to create and launch superior new products on 
time and in budget. However, radically new products involve new and unfamiliar 
technologies. Such new product development (NPD) projects inherently take more risk. In 
order to accelerate new product time-to-market, to reduce NPD cost, and to improve product 
quality, we have seen a noticeable trend toward the paradigm of product platform 
development. A new product platform creates the architecture of a family of products and 
allows a variety of derivative products to be developed more rapidly and easily (Ulrich and 
Eppinger, 2008). Nowadays, many NPD projects belong to derivative product development. 
Hence, NPD project managers often face the problems of derivate NPD project planning and 
control. An inappropriate NPD management approach may jeopardize a product’s chance for 
success. However, many NPD project managers still use intuitive guesses and subjective 
judgment to plan and control NPD projects. In fact, NPD managers need a scientific, 
analytical approach to perceive the relationship among different skill-level human resource 
quantities, facility allocations and activity times, and to consider the costs of the NPD 
resources per unit time so as to achieve the aim of minimum-cost NPD planning and control. 
Hence, this study applies the benchmarking-based concept to develop an integrated 
methodology to assist project managers to plan and manage NPD processes during the 
planning and execution stages of a NPD project. Finally, this study utilizes an industrial 
computer development (ICD) project as a case study to demonstrate the real-world 
application and efficacy of the minimum-cost NPD planning and control methodology. 
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature 
on NPD planning and management. A minimum-cost NPD planning and control 
methodology is presented in Section 3. Section 4 uses a real-world case study of an ICD 
project to elaborate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Finally, 
Section 5 provides a conclusion and clarifies the research limitations. 
 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
Many academics and managers are devoted to addressing the problem of project management. 
The following literature reviews articles published in the areas of project planning and 
control. A survey by Reichelt and Lyneis (1999), the average budget and schedule overruns 
of large development projects are 86% and 55%, respectively. These phenomena emphasize 
the importance of effective process control as well as reasonable time and cost estimation for 
each activity. Pollack-Johnson and Liberatore (2006) formulated a mixed integer linear 
program to optimal tradeoffs among quality, time, and cost for tasks within a project so as to 
make final project scheduling decisions. Yan and Wu (2001) put forward a scheduling 
approach for design activities in concurrent engineering to shorten development time and 
minimize cost. In respect of manpower allocation, this approach considers the ability of 
different individuals and selects the largest ability value in the ability table of this activity. A 
number of heuristic approaches are applied in project scheduling problem. In order to find the 
minimum project duration, Ӧzdamar (1999) proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm approach 
which incorporates problem-specific scheduling knowledge by a chromosome encoding. 
Wang (2005) applied the simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to repair the disrupted 
project schedule with the minimum cost of resource constraint violation. Shou (2007) 
developed a bi-directional ant colony algorithm to search for all feasible project schedules 
without violating the resource constraints. However, the above mentioned approaches need to 
decide the time and resource requirements for each activity based on subjective judgments of 
experts or project managers.  Furthermore, these parameters are fixed, but in reality, activity 
duration and cost are not invariable. Wang and Huang (2000) assumed the time and cost of a 
The Probability Estimate of Meeting the NPD Deadline 
 
This research applies the PERT (program evaluation and review technique)/CPM (critical 
path method) technique to estimate the probability of meeting the specified project deadline. 
This approach assumes the duration of each activity follows the Beta distribution and use 
three-time estimate method as shown in Equation 1 and 2 to acquire the expected value and 
variance of the duration of each NPD activity. According to the above-mentioned information, 
we can calculate the expected value and standard deviation of each path through the project 
network. The path with the longest expected time is the critical path which decides the project 
completion time. Hence, the PERT/CPM approach uses the critical path to calculate the 
probability of meeting the project deadline as shown in Equation 3. The expected complete 
time of the NPD project p ( Pμ ) is the sum of the expected values of the durations of the 
activities on the critical path. Moreover, the variance of the NPD project time ( 2Pσ ) is 
achieved by summing up the variance of the duration of the activities on the critical path.

The Probability Estimate of Meeting the NPD Cost 
 
Firstly, this research uses average input quantities of NPD manpower and facility resources 
per day as well as activity time and the unit cost of each resource to calculates the three costs 
of each NPD activity, i.e., optimistic cost, most-likely cost and pessimistic cost as shown in 
Equation 4, 5, and 6. Due to the linear relationships between the three-cost estimates and 
three-time estimates of a NPD activity, this study can reasonably assume the three-cost 
estimates of a NPD activity also follows Beta distribution. Hence, the expected cost and the 
variance of the cost for the NPD activity i can be gained by using Equation 7 and 8. Finally, 
using Equation 9 calculates the probability that the project cost is less than the specified cost.

model of different skill-level manpower and facilities calculates the quantities of the 
minimum-cost resource allocation under the assigned most-likely time. According to the 
given resource quantities, the NPD project manager can gauge the feasibility of each NPD 
activity time. If it is not feasible, the minimum time estimate with the limited resource 
quantities provides the minimum activity time and optimal resource allocation. Next, the 
NPDPPM estimates the probability of meeting the NPD deadline. If the deadline cannot be 
satisfied, the project manager can employ CTE analysis to evaluate the feasibility of adding 
NPD resources for shortening NPD activity time. If the results of the CTE analysis do not 
violate the NPD resource constraints, the NPD project manager can employ the minimum-
cost way to reduce the activity time. On the contrary, it isn’t feasible and then the project 
manager needs to consult with the customer about the deadline. 
The second step evaluates the feasibility of meeting the NPD cost constraint. The NPDPPM 
is based on the minimum-cost method to allocate NPD resources. Hence, if the probability of 
meeting the NPD cost cannot gratify the customer requirement, the project manager needs to 
consult with customer about the NPD cost constraint. If the cost constraint of the NPD project 
cannot be changed, the NPDPPM suggests that the NPD project manager should reject the 
NPD project. 
In the execution phase, if the NPD activity has delayed, the NPDPCM is activated. The 
NPDPCM is divided into two main parts as shown in Figure 2. The first part is the adjustment 
in the NPD time and resource allocation. The second part is to assess the feasibility of 
meeting the NPD time constraint. Firstly, the NPDPCM notifies that the project manager and 
the NPD engineers evaluate whether the technical bottleneck of the NPD activity can be 
overcome. If it is infeasible, the NPD project manager evaluates the feasibility of outsourcing 
the NPD activity. If it is not feasible, the NPD project is terminated. If it is feasible, the NPD 
project manager re-evaluates activity time and then the NPDPCM calculates the probability 
of meeting the NPD deadline. If the NPD deadline constraint cannot be satisfied, the CTE 
analysis is employed to find the minimum cost way to adjust the following activities for 
reducing the duration of the critical path. If it is infeasible, the NPD manager consults with 
the customer about the deadline constraint. If the time constraint can be gratified, then the 
NPDPCM re-estimates the probability of meeting the NPD cost constraint. According to the 
probability, the NPD project manager can judge whether the NPD cost constraint can be 
satisfied. If the NPD cost constraint cannot be gratified, the NPD project manager needs to 
consult with the customer about the cost constraint of the NPD project.

The Minimum Time Estimate with Limited Resource Quantities 
 
Given the limited resource quantities, Equation 11 can estimate the minimum time of the 
NPD activity. Figure 4 shows the concept of the minimum time estimate (mtp) with limited 
resource quantities. Points ra, rb, rc, rd and re represent the benchmarking NPD activities, 
which most efficiently utilize the NPD resources to minimize the activity time. In addition, 
maybe these limited resources do not have to be inputted completely. Hence, the project 
managers can use Equation 12 and 13 to obtain the optimum NPD resource allocation. 
 
 
Figure 4: The methodological concept of the minimum time estimate with the limited 
resource quantities 
 
As shown in Figure 4, the point p represents the NPD activity p on the critical path. In order 
to shorten the most-likely time of the activity p, the point p moves down along the efficiency 
frontier and then we can find a benchmarking reference point rc. Then, we further compute 
the CTE value of the activity p. Firstly, we calculate the decreasing activity time and the 
changing resource quantities of the activity p, and then the project manager confirms whether 
the increasing resource quantities violate the resource constraints. If these resource 
requirements do not violate the resource limits, we can obtain the CTE value of the activity p 
using Equation (14). Through using the same way, we can calculate the CTE values of other 
NPD activities on the critical path. Then, the project manager can select the best CTE value 
of the NPD activity and then adjust its resource allocation for improving the probability of 
meeting NPD deadline.

CASE STUDY 
 
This study utilizes an ICD project as an example to clarify the efficacy of the proposed 
methodology. Figure 5 shows the network diagram of the ICD project. In this case, because 
this ICD company focuses on NPD activities, manufacturing activities C, G, H, and J are 
being outsourced. Therefore, this paper concentrates on the inner ICD activities of this 
company to demonstrate the significant efficiency and effectiveness of the minimum-cost 
NPD planning and control methodology.

Then, we can use Equation 1 and 2 to calculate the expected value and variance of the 
duration of each ICD activity. There are three paths in the network diagram of the ICD 
project, i.e., A-B-C-D-H-K-L, A-E-F-G-H-K-L, and A-I-J-F-G-H-K-L. The expected lengths 
of these paths are 162, 107 days, 73 days, respectively. Hence, the first path (A-B-C-D-H-K-
L) is the critical path. The customer requires that the probability of meeting the deadline of 
165 days is not less than 0.9. By using Equation 2, we can acquire the probability of meeting 
the deadline is only 0.758. Hence, the NPDPPM evaluates the feasibility of shortening the 
critical path time by adding NPD resources. Because the available resources of the ICD 
activity K are assigned completely, the NPDPPM can only add resource quantities of the ICD 
activities B and D on the critical path for reducing the expected critical path time. In order to 
meet the time constraint of the ICD project, the NPDPPM employs the CTE analysis to find 
the minimum-cost process adjustment method. Through using the requirement estimate 
model of different skill-level manpower and facilities under the specified activity time, we 
can gain the changing amount of each NPD resource for reducing one day. Then the 
NPDPPM uses Equation 14 to obtain the CTE values of the B and D activities, i.e., 9905 and 
6070, respectively. Consequently, the NPDPPM alters the resource allocation of the ICD 
activity D for reducing the expected critical path time. By using the previous analytical 
results, we can understand that the benchmarking reference point is the second activity on 
Table 3. Hence, the most-likely time of the activity D can be decreased three days by 
adjusting resource quantities as shown in Table 14. At the same time, the resource 
requirements don’t violate the resource constraints of the ICD project. Therefore, the ICD 
project manager modifies the three-time estimates, i.e., 45, 53, 58. Next, the NPDPPM re-
estimates the probability of meeting the deadline by using Equation 3. The probability is 
equal to 0.903 which satisfies the customer requirement.

Then the NPDPPM evaluates the feasibility of meeting the cost constraints. The average costs 
of the outsourcing ICD activities C, G, H and J are given by the ICD partners. In respect of 
the inner ICD activities, the NPDPPM can calculate the average costs for these ICD activities 
per day derived from the average resource input quantities. Table 15 shows all average costs 
of the ICD activities per day. Next, the NPDPPM uses Equation 7 and 8 to obtain the three-
estimate costs, the expected costs and cost variances of the ICD activities as shown in Table 
16. The customer requires that the probability of meeting the cost constraint NT $2,670,000 
is 0.9 at least.  By using Equation 9, the probability of meeting the cost constraint is equal to 
0.925 which can gratify the customer requirements. Consequently, the NPDPPM completes 
the NPD process planning.
