Abstract 
In this project, we proposed follows from the 
previous NSC project and consider the 
investigation of equilibrium problems with 
equilibrium constraints (EPEC for short), 
multilevel problems, minimum-norm problems, 
zeros of operators problems, and their composite 
and special cases, including mathematical 
programs, variational inequality problems, etc. 
as special cases, based on the techniques of 
metric fixed-point theorem and nonlinear 
analysis. We study some kinds of iterative 
algorithms for solving these problems based on 
investigating framework of hierarchical fixed 
point problems (HFPP for short).  
We first prove a strong convergence 
theorem by using a projection method which 
solves some variational inequality. As a special 
case, this projection method also solves some 
minimization problem. Secondly, under 
different restrictions on parameters, we obtain 
another strong convergence result which solves 
the hierarchical fixed point problem. The related 
interesting examples are given. Based on that, 
we can extend and improve some known results 
in literature. Under the partially support of NSC 
in 2011, we publish totally 21 high quality of 
journal papers and 2 conference papers (see: 
section 6). 
Keywords? VIP, EPEC, HFPP, nonexpansive

??????? 
Recently, hierarchical fixed point problems and 
hierarchical minimization problems have 
attracted many authors’ attention due to their 
link with some convex programming problems. 
4 
references therein. 
?????? 
In order to solve the hierarchical fixed point 
problem HFFP, Moudafi [15] introduced the 
following Krasnoselski–Mann’s algorithm: 
 
where  and  are two real numbers in 
(0,1). However, we note that the author only 
obtained a weak convergence result. 
Very recently, Yao and Liou [29] further 
studied the convergence of the 
Krasnoselski–Mann’s iterative algorithm for 
solving problem HFPP under the weaker 
restrictions on parameters. Moreover, when S is 
a contraction, Yao and Liou [29] gave a strong 
convergence result under different restrictions 
on parameters for solving problem HFPP. Hence, 
this brings us a natural problem: how to obtain a 
strong convergence result when S is a 
nonexpansive mapping ? For this purpose, 
Mainge and Moudafi [12] introduced and 
studied the following iterative algorithm: 
 
where  and  are two sequences in (0,1). 
Under some assumptions on operators and 
algorithm parameters, the authors obtained a 
strong convergence result. Very recently, 
Cianciaruso et al. [8] introduced another 
iterative algorithm and proved some strong 
convergence results for solving the HFPP. 
Related works can be found in [6,7,10,25]. 
Motivated and inspired by the works in 
this direction, in this project we first prove a 
strong convergence theorem by using a 
projection method which solves some 
variational inequality. As a special case, this 
projection method also solves some 
minimization problem. Secondly, under 
different restrictions on parameters, we obtain 
another strong convergence result which solves 
the hierarchical fixed point problem. In order to 
achieve the purpose of the research, we will  
give some preliminaries and need the following 
background in the argument of the subsequent 
section. 
Lemma 1 ([9], Demiclosedness Principle for 
Nonexpansive Mappings). Let C be a nonempty 
closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space H 
and let T: C C be a nonexpansive mapping 
with Fix(T)  ;. If {xn} is a sequence in C 
weakly converging to x and if {(I-T)xn} 
converges strongly to y, then (I-T)x = y; in 
particular, if y = 0, then x Fix(T). 
The metric (or nearest point) projection 
from H onto C is the mapping projC: H C 
which assigns to each point x  C the unique 
point projC[x]  C satisfying the property 
 
The following properties of projections are 
useful and pertinent to our purposes. 
Lemma 2. Given x   H and z   C, 
(i) That z = projC[x] if and only if there holds 
the relation: 
 
(ii) That z = projC[x] if and only if there holds 
the relation: 
 
(iii) There holds the relation 
 
Consequently, projC is nonexpansive and 
monotone. 
Lemma 3. For all x, y   H, there holds the 
inequality 
 
Lemma 4 ([13]). Let f : C H be a contraction 
with coefficient     [0,1) and T: C C be a 
nonexpansive mapping. Then for all x; y   C, 
6 
algorithm (2) solves the minimum norm solution 
of Fix(T). 
Inspected by recent work in the literature, 
our results can extend and improve some known 
results in literature. Our results studied in the 
project can be viewed as a refinement and 
modification of many results in the literature. 
Under the support of this NSC project, we have 
publish 21 high quality journal papers and 2 
conference papers.

Main Results
• Motivated and inspired by the works in this direction, in this 
talk we will use this idea to introduce both viscosity method and 
new hybrid method for solving some hierarchical (two-level) 
fixed point problem and variational inequality problem under 
some conditions on involved parameters in Hilbert spaces.
• Our method includes some algorithms in the literature as 
special cases. We prove that the proposed algorithms strongly 
converges to an element which solves some hierarchical fixed 
point problem and variational inequality problem.
