A Bond Graph Approach for Predicting the Trigger Hook Response 
Time of High-Voltage Circuit Breaker Driving Mechanisms 
                   
Abstract:  This report presents an energy-based bond graph approach for simulating 
the trigger hook response time of the driving mechanism used in high-voltage circuit 
breakers. The complicate topology changing motion characteristics of the mechanism 
and the corresponding contact impact phenomena are largely simplified in the bond 
graph model by introducing a continuous contact force module with switched 
zero-junction. A practical method for calibrating the equivalent system parameters of 
the model based on simple experiment data is also presented. The effectiveness and 
accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparing the simulated results with the 
measured data of a real system under various applied conditions.

will be allowed to rotate to drive the switch contactors by the spring forces of the open 
and the wipe spring, such that the configuration of the mechanism would be changed 
from Fig. 2(c) to Fig. 2(d), and the elapsed time of this final period is referred to as the 
main shaft driven time (MSDT). 
    A number of methods have been developed for analyzing and simulating the 
general motion characteristics of solenoids (Pawlak et al., 1988; Lequesne, 1990; 
Marielle et al., 1999). Besides, as indicated by Root and Ragsdell (1983), the MSDT of 
the circuit breaker can be calculated by using commercial available multi-body dynamic 
simulation programs such as IMP or ADAMS. Therefore, the subject matter of this 
article is focused on establishing a systematic approach to predict the THRT. 
    In order to compute the THRT, it is necessary to first formulate the dynamic model 
of the driving mechanism of the circuit breaker. However, it should be noted that the 
kinematic structure of the circuit breaker is different from conventional single degree of 
freedom planar mechanisms in that it undergoes a sequence of topology changes during 
a motion cycle. As indicated in figure 2, the armature and the trigger hook will separate 
from each other after a very short period of contact. Consequently, the kinematic 
constraints imposed on the mechanism at the two stages (i.e. before and after) of the 
contacting period would be different. Although the topology changing problem may be 
handled by individually performing dynamic analysis at each stage, or, as suggested in 
Gilmore and Cipra (1991), by using an incidence matrix to bookkeeping and 
reformulate the kinematic constraint equations at different stages to achieve continuous 
dynamic analysis, the involved derivations and mathematic manipulations of these 
methods are very elaborate, and, hence, may not be appreciated by industrial engineers 
at large. In order to resolve this difficulty, a bond graph based approach for modeling 
 7
The bond graph models of the five subsystems constructed on the basis of the above 
assumptions are shown in Fig. 4(a) ~ 4(e) and are separately explained as below: 
 
2.1 Armature of Solenoid 
The armature of the solenoid is modeled as a moving mass which connected to an 
adverse reset spring and subjected to an electro-magnetic force before contact. The bond 
graph of such model is shown in Fig. 4(a), in which the mass of the armature is 
represented by an inertial element I with parameter am , and the reset spring is 
represented by a capacitor element C with parameter ka. An effort source element, Se, 
with parameter Fe, is used to represent the driving electro-magnetic force induced by 
electric current, the value of which is obtained according to the characteristics of the 
solenoid. The three elements are constrained by a 1-junction of the armature velocity, 
va. 
 
2.2 Impact Contact between Armature and Trigger Hook   
The moving armature contacts the trigger hook after traveling a specific distance from 
the position of Fig. 2(a) to that of Fig. 2(b). The topological change of the mechanism 
due to discontinuous contact with impact is handled by introducing a switched 
zero-junction, X0 (Breedveld, 2002) and a continuous force model with stiffness and 
damping in the bond graph of Fig. 4(b).  
    As shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 4(b), the velocity of the armature, va, and 
that of the trigger hook, vh, are integrated to obtain the positions of the armature and the 
trigger hook. The velocity of the 1-junction of impact velocity, vah, is the difference 
between the velocity of contact point on the armature and that of the trigger hook. The

In which vm and Em (m = i, j) are respectively the Poisson’s ratio and the Young’s 
modulus of body m. It should, however, be noted that the stiffness constant K so 
calculated only gives an idealized estimation of its true value, as the material property 
and the structure of the investigated physical system may not be consistent with the 
assumptions. A method for calibrating this parameter is given in section 3 of this report.  
 
2.3 Trigger Hook 
The trigger hook is connected with the reset spring, the stop bar, and the mechanism of 
trigger cam and roller as shown in block (c) of Fig. 3, the bond graph of which is 
modeled in Fig. 4(c). The velocity of the trigger hook, vh, obtained from momentum 
transfer of contact reaction, is first transformed into the angular velocity of the trigger 
hook shaft, 1θ& , by a transformer modulus TF:s3, where s3 denotes the length of the 
lever arm, and then transformed into the linear velocity of the hook reset spring by 
TF:s4. The elements I, C, and R with parameters Jh, kh, and bh are used to denote, 
respectively, the moment of inertia of the trigger hook, the stiffness of the reset spring, 
and the rotational friction of the trigger hook. It should be noted that the friction 
coefficient bh is difficult to be evaluated precisely by either theoretic calculations or 
simple experiments, as which includes the effect due to the friction of the trigger hook 
shaft and that between the trigger cam and the roller. Nevertheless, this difficulty can be

2.5 Main Shaft 
The main shaft is connected to the trigger cam and roller mechanism together with the 
open spring and the wipe spring as shown in block (e) of Fig. 3. It is forced to first 
rotate a small clockwise angle before being driven backwardly while the release angle 
of the trigger hook is reached. The energy transmitted from the trigger cam mechanism 
is considered to be dissipated in the forms of rotational kinetic energy of the main shaft

condition such as rated voltage to evaluate the duration time of the contact period. An 
experiment under the same nominal condition is then performed on the real system and 
the actual time of contact period is measured for comparison. If the later is larger than 
the former, then it implies that the estimated value of the stiffness constant K should be 
reduced, otherwise it should be increased. Consequently, a one dimensional search 
algorithm can be applied along with the simulation process to adjust the stiffness 
constant until the simulated duration time of contact period converges to the measured 
time. 
    A similar approach can be used for calibrating the value of the friction coefficient 
bh. A numerical simulation with no friction (i.e. bh = 0) is first carried out to evaluate 
the duration time of the after-contact period, which is then compared against the 
experiment data obtained under the same nominal condition, and the value of bh can be 
gradually increased until the two data are consistent to each other. 
 
4.  COMPARISON OF SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT DATA 
A practical example is presented in this section to demonstrate the effectiveness and 
accuracy of the proposed method. The measured dimensions and system parameters of 
the mechanism used for the example is given in Table 1, in which the restitution 
coefficient re  of 0.74 is obtained from data of hard steel (Goldsmith, 1960). By using 
Eq.(2), the value of the stiffness constant K is first estimated to be 8.3×109 N/m, and the 
simulation is carry out at rated voltage of 110 V which rendered an impact velocity of 
3.8 m/s. The simulated results of the impact force, trigger hook angle, trigger hook 
velocity, and armature velocity are shown in Fig. 7. As indicated in the figure, the 
simulated THRT is 1.24 ms, which consists of a contact period of 0.10 ms and an 
 15
experimental data, as listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the differences between the 
two sets of data are no greater than the precision scale (0.1 ms) of the measuring 
instrument, and hence the accuracy and effectiveness of the calibration process is 
justified.  
 
5.  CONCLUSIONS       
    A systematic approach to predict the trigger hook response time of high-voltage 
circuit breaker has been developed in this report. By using bond graph formulation, the 
topology-changing problem of the mechanism is simplified by introducing a continuous 
contact force module with switched zero-junctions. An effective method based on 
experimental data for calibrating the equivalent stiffness constant and friction 
coefficient of the system is also presented. Numerical examples indicate that the 
proposed approach provides a convenient and accurate method of predicting the THRT. 
In addition, a realistic estimation of the amount of the impact force, which is useful for 
determining the necessary strength of the trigger hook and the armature but difficult to 
be measured experimentally, can be obtained alongside of the simulation process. 
Therefore, it is believed that the presented approach can be adopted in future researches 
on the optimal design of high-voltage circuit breaker mechanisms.
