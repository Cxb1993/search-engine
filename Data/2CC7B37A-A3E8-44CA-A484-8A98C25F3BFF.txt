Abstract 
 
In order to understand and analyze the 
function of DNA, researchers have to obtain 
each haplotype of an individual for analysis. 
To this end, one has to solve the population 
haplotype inference (PHI) problem to infer 
haplotype data from genotype data for a 
population. Previous researches require 
criterions to define the objectives for the PHI 
problem. Among those criterions, the pure 
parsimony criterion (HIPP) proposed by 
Gusfield (2003) has received much attention 
recently. HIPP seeks the minimum number of 
distinct haplotypes to resolve a given 
genotype matrix. Two integer linear 
programming (ILP) models have been 
proposed to solve the HIPP problem to 
optimality. Several heuristic algorithms have 
also been reported to have good performance 
in solving the HIPP problem. This research 
focuses in solving the HIPP problem based 
on the mathematical programming methods 
and heuristic algorithms. New HIPP 
formulations, bound estimations, and 
algorithms will be proposed in the 
second-year part.

二、緣由與目的 
 
In the Post-Genomic Era, the 
development of a full Haplotype Map has 
high priority since Helmuth (2001) suggests 
that the knowledge about the genetic 
constitution of an individual chromosome 
called haplotypes can be applied in linkage 
disequilibrium, inference of population 
evolutionary history, disease diagnosis, and 
customization of treatment for each 
individual. The haplotype is a sequence of 
closely linked single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in one copy of a 
chromosome. There are two haplotypes in a 
pair of chromosomes in all diploid organisms. 
Since the collection of haplotypes data 
  3
q
bounds for the HIPP objective value may still 
be too loose. Similar compatible relations are 
also independently discussed by Lynce and 
Marques-Silva (2008) and Lynce et al. (2008), 
where they propose several techniques, 
different from ours, to improve the lower 
bounding procedures for their SHIPs method. 
In next section, we introduce two heuristic 
algorithms that seek a good solution in 
practice based on the compatible relations. 
 
四、新的 HIPP 演算法: MGP 
 
Based on the compatible genotype pair 
relations, the common haplotypes for any 
two compatible genotypes can be easily 
identified and used to give a feasible solution 
to the HIPP problem. First, we construct a 
merged genotype pair, denoted as k , 
, for each compatible genotype 
pair  as follows: 
mg 
1,...,k = 
( ,ag g )b
1.  ,, : a jk j , if , for 
1,...,
mg g= , , {0,1,2}a j b jg g= ∈
j n= , 
2.  , : 1k j  or 0, if 
} or 
)}, respectively, 
for 1,..., . 
mg =
, ,( ,a j b jg g
, ,( ,a j b jg g
=
) {(1,2), (2,1)∈
) {(0,2), (2,0∈
j n
After conducting the pairwise comparisons, 
all the  distinct merged genotype pairs q
: {( ) : 1,..., }kMG G mg k q= =  
2(O m n
{ : a i
 for a given 
genotype matrix G  can be identified in 
 time. For each , we use )
( ) :
ig
k k  }aIVMG i mg g g= ⊗ mg=  g G∀ ∈  
to record the set of its compatible merged 
genotype pairs.  
Similar to the minimum arc covering 
technique for estimating the  upper bound 
that selects the minimum number of arcs (i.e. 
compatible relations) in  to cover all the 
nodes (i.e. genotypes), our first heuristic 
algorithm, called as MGP, selects the 
minimum number of merged pairs in  to 
cover all the nodes. Since a merged pair may 
contain more than one arc (i.e. compatible 
relation) in , the objective value of MGP 
tends to be better than the objective value 
obtained by the minimum arc covering 
heuristics for upper bound.

In particular, for each component  in

to select a set of minimal number of merged 
genotype pairs in  that covers all the 
nodes in component . Suppose these 
selected merged genotype pairs form a 
subgraph of , denoted as . Then, we 
enumerate all the candidate haplotypes for 
each selected merged genotype pair, and 
formulate another integer linear

gives a set of minimum number of distinct 
haplotypes that resolves all the genotypes 
covered in complement  from those 
candidate haplotypes that can resolve the 
selected merged genotype pairs defined in

 in , in a sense MGP tries to compute a 
good feasible solution from a reduced 
solution space of the original problem. The 
final solution is obtained by the union of the 
solutions obtained for each component in

follows:

摘要 
 
The ICCAS-SICE 2009 conference has a special meaning to both SICE of Japan and ICROS of 
Korea, which are the leading academic societies in Japan and Korea, respectively. The two societies 
already have a long history of collaboration such as attending each annual conference and 
organizing joint conference and sessions. The ICCAS-SICE 2009 is the second collaboration after 
SICE-ICCAS 2006 which consists of more than 1,100 papers by authors from 31 countries. Japan 
and Korea contribute most (around 660 and 240 papers, respectively). Thailand, China, Taiwan, and 
United Kingdom follow in this order. I attended the session titled “Optimization Algorithms and 
Applications”, as well as other sessions and learned many interesting research topics..

三、 心得 
 
I am glad that I have participated in this conference. One reason is that I have met with 
several excellent scholars in the fields of my research interests. Among the talks I have 
attended, I am more impressed by the following papers: “Cluster-Structured Particle Swarm 
Optimization with Interaction”, “An Exact Algorithm based on Lagrangian Relaxation for the 
Input-Output Scheduling Problem in automated Warehouses” and “Decomposition Model of 
Vehicle Routing Problem and Hybrid Approach Mixing Branch-and-bound Techniques and 
Meta-heuristics”. In the first talk, several researchers asked why the author chose an unusual 
way to search for the solution, but the speaker could not understand the question and thus not
