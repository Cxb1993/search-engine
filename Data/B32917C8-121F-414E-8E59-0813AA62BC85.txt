temperature distribution produced by the Joule heating effect nearby 
the channel wall in a microfluidic chip utilizing a temperature-
dependent fluorescence dye. An advanced optical microscope 
system—total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) 
is used for measuring the temperature distribution on the channel 
wall at the point of electroosmotic flow in an electrokinetically 
driven microfluidic chip. The short fluorescence excitation depth 
from a TIRFM system makes the intensity information obtained is 
not sensitive to the channel depth variation which ususally biases 
the measured results while using conventional epi-fluorescence 
microscope (Epi-FM). A TIRFM can precisely describe the 
temperature profile of the distance within 100 nm of the channel 
wall where consists of the Stern layer and the diffusion layer for an 
electrokinetic microfluidic system. In addition, this research 
presents a method to reduce the Joule heating effect and enhance the 
separation efficiency of DNA biosamples in a chip-based capillary 
electrophoresis (CE) system utilizing pulse DC electric fields. 
Results indicate the proposed TIRFM provides higher measurement 
sensitivity over Epi-FM. Significant temperature gradient along the 
channel depth is experimentally observed. In addition, the measured 
wall temperature distributions can be the boundary conditions for 
numerical investigation into the Joule heating effect. The proposed 
method gives a precise temperature profile of microfluidic channels 
and shows the substantial impact on developing a numerical 
simulation model for precisely predicting the Joule heating effect in 
microfluidic chips. The performance of the proposed method is 
further evaluated by separating a DNA sample of Hae III digested 
ΦX–174 ladder. Results indicate the separation level of the two 
neighboring peaks of 5a (271 bp) and 5b (281 bp) in the DNA 
ladder is as high as 120% which is difficult to be achieved using a 
conventional CE scheme. The improved separation performance is 
attributed to a lower Joule heating effect as a result of a lower 
average power input and the opportunity for heat dissipation during 
the zero-voltage stage of the pulse cycle. Overall, the results 
demonstrate a simple, low-cost technique for achieving a high 
separation performance in CE microchips.

shown in the chart represents the test samples passing through the detection 
point, where a light source and a photodetector work, in order. Electrokinetic 
forces, both electroosmotic and electrophoretic, are generally adopted for

effect causes the properties of the fluid, such us the pH of the buffer, the 
electrical conductivity, the diffusion coefficient, the dynamic viscosity, and so 
forth, to become non-uniform, which affect both the applied electric potential 
field and the flow field [16, 17] and may influence the reproducibility of the 
buffer [18]. It has also been reported that the Joule heating effect may alter the 
conformations of the DNA molecules within the sample and may cause the 
uncertain separation parameters [19].

Finally, the Joule heating effect not only reduces the separation efficiency 
of a CE separation system, but also increases the buffer temperature, which in 
turn may prompt the thermal decomposition of unstable samples and 
denaturation of proteins and nucleic acids [20]. Issaq et al. [21] discussed the 
influence of temperature on DNA separation efficiency and found that the best 
temperature of DNA separation is at 25–50oC. Wang et al. [22] discussed the 
relationship between the intensity of applied electric fields and the sample 
 6
capillary with a probe method to analysis the temperature variation. Gobie et al. 
[30] and Lacey et al. [35] measured the temperature variation in the capillary by 
Gobie-Ivory method and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These methods, 
however, are indirect and the data obtained using these measured temperatures 
are averaged due to the indirect measurement methods. Rathore [36] reviewed 
researches of numerical simulation and experiments with regard to the Joule 
heating effect and the raised temperature in a CE system. Alternatively, 
Sakakibara et al. [37] developed a novel method of using a 
temperature-dependent fluorescent dye as the index for measuring the 
temperature in a macroscopic system in 1999. This technology is that only 
adding the diluted fluorescent dye as the index for measuring the temperature in 
the measured buffer solution. The method takes advantage of some kinds of 
fluorescence dyes changing their fluorescence intensity with temperature 
variation [25, 37-41]. Ross et al. [42, 43] reported the method which used these 
kinds of temperature-dependent fluorescent dyes as the index for measuring the 
temperature distribution of the buffer solution in the microchannels, based on 
the method presented by Sakakibara et al. [37] in a macroscopic system. 
Temperature measurement using temperature-dependent fluorescence dyes in 
microchannels has since become one of the most popular methods [44, 45].  
For example, Ross et al. [42] and Erickson et al. [46] used 
temperature-dependent dyes as the index to measure the temperature in the 
microchannels. The measured temperature averaged 25–53oC in a glass 
microchannel of 75 μm in width and 30 μm in depth [42] and averaged 25–35oC 
in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/glass microchannel of 120 μm in width and 
20 μm in depth [46]. Xuan et al. [25] also used temperature-dependent dyes to 
measure the temperature distribution and the variation of EOF velocity in the 
 8
that the internal temperature in the microchannel should be about 71oC and the 
temperature on the microchannel wall should be about 47oC at the applied 
electric field of 500 V/cm. The temperature difference between the internal 
channel and the channel wall could reach even as high as 54oC [51]. In general, 
there are many factors that affect temperature changes due to the Joule heating 
effect, including geometry, electric field strength, applied time, substrate 
materials and thicknesses, buffer conductivity, and etc. However, these 
divergent results still indicate that more research regarding the temperature on 
the microchannel wall is needed. Chein et al. [53] presented a simple analytical 
model that predicts the temperature and pressure variations inside an 
electrokinetically driven microchannel with the Joule heating effect. A lumped 
analysis over the cross-sectional area is used which leads to a nice closed form 
solution. Tang et al. [58] also reported that the Joule heating effect was the 
constraint which limits the maximum applied voltage for inducing fluid pressure 
using electrokinetic driving force. Moreover, the Joule heating effect is 
responsible for the low thermodynamic efficiencies of the pump, since the 
major part of the power consumption is due to the Joule heating effect. Xuan 
[59] revisited the Joule heating effect by considering the increased conductivity 
within the electric double layer (EDL). He demonstrated that such contribution 
of the so-called surface conductance is generally negligible in terms of the 
temperature profile. Although several works have been reported to investigate 
the temperature distribution inside a microfluidic channel, experimental 
measurement on the wall temperature distribution is still lacking as of today. 
A TIRFM is an advanced optics technology for enhancing fluorescence 
image resolution.(this sentence is not really true) Only within 100 nm of the cover 
glass is the excited range of the detected fluorescence sample. Therefore, a 
 10
the microchannel wall can be achieved. 
Total internal reflection (TIR) is a common optics phenomenon occurring at 
the interface. In general, the TIR usually occurs at the interface between the 
cover glass and the sample medium, mainly aqua, when the light source is 
incident to the microchip through a high numerical aperture (NA) objective. 
Only within 100 nm of the cover glass is the excited range. The excited range is 
at nano level and therefore the technology is suitable most for observation of 
fluorescence sample quite closed to the cover glass, for example, physiology of 
cell membrane, molecule interaction, etc. A TIRFM can dramatically reduce the 
background noise of the fluorophore which lies far from the cover glass and can 
effectively enhance the captured image resolution, especially nearby the cover 
glass.

An Epi-FM is the most commonly adopted method to excite and measure 
the emission fluorescence in the embedded microchannel due to its simple and 
straightforward detection scheme (Figure 5 (a)). Nevertheless, the measured 
temperature is always biased by the comparative long DOF of an Epi-FM. In 
this regards, the Epi-FM detection scheme is not able to measure the 
temperature distribution at the channel wall where the most rapid heat 
conduction occurs. In addition, because this boundary layer is composed of the 
Stern and the diffusion layer for an electroosmotic system, it affects the 
behavior of an EOF significantly. In contrast to the Epi-FM detection scheme, a 
TIRFM creates a highly sensitive and high-contrast image of single molecules 
within 100 nm of the cover glass such that the noise outside the evanescence 
wave range is automatically filtered by the TIRFM scheme (Figure 5 (b)).

2. Motivation and objectives 
2.1 Motivation 
In general, the Joule heating effect brings drawbacks for the operation, 
including causing a temperature gradient, non-uniform fluid properties, thermal 
decomposition or denaturation of bio-samples, poor reproducibility and 
decreased separation efficiency. Therefore, investigation of the Joule heating 
effect in electrokinetically driven microfluidic chips is of great importance for 
researchers who work in this field. Many methods have been reported to 
evaluate the induced Joule heat in a microchannel. However, the divergent 
results indicate more research is needed, especially on the temperature 
measurement of microchannel wall at the point where the EOF occurs in an 
electrokinetically driven microfluidic chip. The wall temperature is a major 
parameter for analyzing the fluid behavior in a microfluidic channel and can be 
 16
pulse electric field to a CE separation system is still lacking. 
 
2.2 Objectives 
In order to precisely study the temperature distribution on the 
microchannel wall in microfluidic chips, this research presents a new detection 
technique, the TIRFM of nano level resolution, for measuring the temperature 
distribution nearby the channel wall at the point where the EOF occurs in an 
electrokinetically driven microfluidic chip. A TIRFM can precisely describe the 
temperature profile of the distance within 100 nm of the channel wall. The 
temperature-dependent dye of Rhodamine B filled the microchannel acted as the 
measurement index. High resolution images from nearby the cover glass are 
first captured using a high performance charge-coupled device (CCD) via a 
modified microscope system which is capable of TIRFM and Epi-FM functions 
within a single microscope. The captured images are then used for calculating 
the temperature distribution on the microchannel wall using a digital image 
processing technique. The study also applies the Epi-FM to measure the internal 
temperature in the microchannel for comparison with the results measured by 
TIRFM. The temperature variations under different applied electric fields and 
different times are measured and visualized. In addition, the measured wall 
temperatures are used as the boundary conditions for numerical investigation 
into the Joule heating effect. The proposed method can give a precise 
temperature profile of microfluidic channels and shows the substantial impact 
on developing a numerical simulation model for precisely predicting the Joule 
heating effect in microfluidic chips. 
Moreover, in this study, a standard LIF detection system incorporated a 
 18
the channel wall at the point where EOF occurs. Figure 7 shows the 
experimental setup in this study, capable of switching the inverted microscope 
(TE2000-U, Nikon, Japan) into TIRFM or Epi-FM mode in seconds to eliminate 
the measurement variations. Therefore, the temperature information inside the 
microfluidic channel from Epi-FM and TIRFM can be obtained in a single test 
run such that the influence factors from the uncontrolled parameters can be 
excluded. All the equipment and experiments are operated on a low-vibration 
optic table at room temperature of 26oC. The Epi-FM mode is the same as a 
standard LIF detection system. In the white-light TIRFM (W-TIRFM) mode, a 
mercury lamp module (Model C-SHG1, Nikon, Japan) is adopted for the 
excitation and observation of the fluorescent images as a ringlike light source 
using a crescent optical grating. A white-light source enables multicolor 
fluorescence images. Switching into TIRFM mode, the TIR occurs at the 
interface between the cover glass and the microfluidic channel full of diluted 
Rhodamine B (479.01 g/mole, Acros Organics, USA) when the light source is 
incident to the microchip by a high NA (1.45) and 60× objective. Rhodamine B 
is diluted by the buffer, 10 mM Na2B4O7‧10H2O (Borax, Showa Chemical Co., 
Japan), pH = 9.2. 
The output voltage was provided by a high-voltage power amplifier 
(MP-3500-250P, Major Science, Taiwan) capable of ±3500 V and was fed into 
the CE microfluidic chip. A CCD module (Digital Sight DS-U2, Nikon 
Corporation, Japan) was used to detect the emitted fluorescence images both in 
Epi-FM and in TIRFM mode. The sample well was given positive voltage to 
drive the analytes and the waste well was ground. This study used a 
temperature-dependent fluorescence dye of Rhodamine B to evaluate the 
 20
(E-400, Nikon, Japan) and a mercury lamp module is used for the excitation and 
observation of the fluorescent samples. Figure 8 shows the experimental setup 
in this study. A DAQ module (USBDAQ-9100MS, Adlink Technology inc., 
Taiwan) controlled by Labview® program is used to generate the low-voltage 
input signals then the signals were amplified 200X using a high-voltage power 
amplifier (677B-L-CE-EX, Trek Inc., USA). The output voltage was fed into the 
CE microfluidic chip via a home-built relay system. The high-voltage power 
amplifier is capable of generating electricity up to 2 kV with the frequency 
from 0 kHz (i.e. a DC signal) to 1 kHz and is used to carry out CE separation; 
electrophoresis and electroosmotic effects are then pulsely induced. A 
photomultiplier tube (PMT) module (R928, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) is 
used to detect the emitted fluorescence signals. The optical data was collect 
using a 16 bit data acquisition (DAQ) card (SISC, 9924, Scientific Information 
Service Corp., USA) with the sampling rate of 20 Hz. 
Figure 2.6 (a) and (b) present the power modes for the conventional DC 
electric field and the proposed pulse DC electric fields. All the CE tests in this 
study can be successively operated for more than 50 min without sample 
leakage in the separation channel. A double-L injection technique was used to 
inject the sample plug into the separation channel. This method was developed 
by Lin [73] in order to minimize the sample leakage and the baseline drift. The 
injection was set at the applied electric field of 170–290 V/cm with 5 s loading 
time for a 12 mm long injection channel. The separation was set at the applied 
electric field of 150–300 V/cm in all testing cases. For the pulse DC electric 
fields, a short period of DC field (5 s) was applied at the beginning of the 
separation stage in order to drive the sample plug leaving the channel cross 
division. Then pulse DC electric fields were applied following the short period

3.3 Experimental procedures 
A temperature-dependent dye of Rhodamine B was filled in the 
microchannel and was used to evaluate the temperature distribution. The 
fluorescent intensity of Rhodamine B is dependent on its temperature; therefore, 
measuring the fluorescent intensity gradient can detect the temperature 
distribution in the microchannel. The concentration of the Rhodamine B 
fluorescence used in this study is 10-4 M. Prior to the temperature measurement 
utilizing the temperature-dependent Rhodamine B dye, a temperature versus 
fluorescence intensity calibration curve in the temperature range of 25–70oC 
was first obtained using Epi-FM and TIRFM (Figure 9). The blue circle marks 
and the red triangle marks represent the calibration curves measured by Epi-FM 
and TIRFM, repectively. The calibration curves shown in Figure 9 were not 
obtained by capturing the fluorescence intensity in the microchannel. Instead, a 
home-made cuvette with a cover glass slide bottom and a PID (proportional 
integral derivative) -controlled heater system were used to measure the

Figure 9 Calibration curves regarding the measured emission intensity of 
Rhodamine B under different temperature by Epi-FM and TIRFM. The blue 
circle marks and the red triangle marks represent the calibration curves 
measured by Epi-FM and TIRFM, repectively. The curve is approximately 
linear at 25–40oC which was identical with the report by Sakakibara et al. [38]. 
 
The emission spectrogram of Rhodamine B under different temperature 
was acquired by a spectrometer (HR4000, Ocean Optics, USA) (Figure 10). The 
PID-controlled heater system was also used to heat the home-made cuvette. The 
concentration of the Rhodamine B fluorescence used is 10-4 M as well. Results 
indicate the Rhodamine B changes only its intensity under different temperature 
while keeping the same shape in the spectrogram. Since Rhodamine is a neutral 
dye, both physical adsorption and absorption phenomena are not significant 
while detecting the emission intensity under the standarad LIF detection 
scheme.  
 26
The z-axis is the radial position of the microchannel. The seven wedges lie on 
the x-axis from right to left show different visualized measured fluorescence 
intensity variation under different application times of applied electric fields, 
0–60 s. Results show the measured fluorescence intensity decreased–which 
means the measured temperature increased–with increased application times of 
applied electric fields, by both TIRFM and Epi-FM. The measured fluorescence 
intensity by TIRFM was lower than that by Epi-FM due to the excitation depth 
of Rhodamine B in the microchannel (Figure 4). 
A mixed fluorescent sample composed of two fluorescent dyes, 0.5 mM 
Rhodamine B (479.01 g/mole, Acros Organics, USA) and 0.1 mM Rhodamine 
6G (479.02 g/mole, Sigma-Aldrich co., USA) and a standard DNA ladder were 
used to evaluate the separation performance using the proposed pulse DC 
electric fields. Note that the physical properties of the two fluorescent dyes, 
Rhodamine B and Rhogamine 6G, are almost identical and have only 0.002% 
difference in their molecular weights. The concentration of Rhodamine B was 
adjusted to 5-fold higher than Rhodamine 6G for better distinguishing the 
emitted signals of these two fluorescent dyes. The running buffer used in this 
test was 10 mM Na2B4O7.10H2O (Borax, Showa chemical co., Japan), pH = 9.2. 
For the DNA separation test, ΦX–174 DNA standard ladder (Hae III digested, 
Takara Bio, Japan) was chosen as the biosamples and 1.5% hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC) (Sigma-Aldrich co., USA) dyeing YO-PRO-1 iodide 
(Molecular Probes, USA) was used as the sieves. 
 28
microchannel under different power supply modes, Rhodamine B was full of the 
microchannel as a temperature index. The fluorescent intensity of Rhodamine B 
is dependent on its temperature; therefore, measuring the fluorescent intensity 
variation can detect the temperature variation in the microchannel. The 
Rhodamine B in the microchannel was electrically driven under DC and the 
proposed pulse electric fields. Then the change of fluorescent intensity in the 
microchannel was detected by the CCD and could be calculated to the change of 
temperature in the microchannel by the temperature versus fluorescence 
calibration curve measured by Epi-FM in Figure 9. For the experiments of 
measuring the real power variation under different power supply modes, the 
variation of the electric current provided in different electric fields conditions 
was measured. Then the real measured power was achieved by calculating the 
measured variation of the electric current.  
 
4. Results and Discussion 
4.1 Measurements of Joule heating effect 
Figure 12 presents the measured temperature in the microchannel under 
different driving electric fields by the TIRFM and Epi-FM methods, 
respectively. The solid line in Figure 12 shows the numerically obtained 
temperature profile at the center of the channel using the experimental data 
obtained by TIRFM. Note that the applied electric field for this test was ramped 
successively and the data were collected continuously in a test run. The Epi-FM 
measured the temperature in the microchannel, while the TIRFM measured the 
temperature on the microchannel wall. All driving electric fields were applied 
for 20 s prior to the fluorescence intensity measurement in Figure 12. When an 
 30
26–31oC and 28–49oC, respectively. The temperature measured with TIRFM 
was lower than that with Epi-FM due to the fast heat conduction on the channel 
wall. The measured temperature variation by TIRFM was within 3oC while the 
applied electric field was lower than 800 V/cm. At the same time, the measured 
temperature difference between TIRFM and Epi-FM methods also increased 
with the increasing applied electric field, ranging from about 2 to 17oC. Results 
show that as the applied electric field increased, the temperature on the 
microchannel wall measured by TIRFM was slower to increase than the 
temperature in the microchannel measured by Epi-FM due to the fast heat 
conduction on the channel wall. These results also give strong evidences on 
describing the temperature gradient inside the microfluidic channel. 
Figure 13 shows the corresponding measured temperature with increasing 
time under an applied electric field of 800 V/cm by Epi-FM and TIRFM, 
respectively. Again, the solid line in Figure 13 shows the numerically obtained 
temperature profile at the center of the channel using the data obtained by 
TIRFM. For the lines presented in Figure 12 and Figure 13, we found that the 
temperatures obtained numerically were a bit lower than the temperatures 
obtained experimentally especially at high temperature regions, since the 
temperatures obtained numerically were averaged from temperatures all over 
the cross section of the microchannel. The temperature measured with TIRFM 
was lower than that with Epi-FM due to the fast heat conduction on the 
microchannel wall. The measured temperature by Epi-FM ranged between 
about 35 and 55oC. The variation in temperature measured by TIRFM was 
within 3oC, and was also relatively small even under a comparatively long 
electric field application times of 60 s, indicating the significant heat conduction 
rate on the microchannel wall. The measured temperature difference between

presents the temperature distribution of centerline in the microchannel. The 
maximum temperature is about 44.7 and 48.4oC at a distance of 1,000 μm 
downstream from the sample container for 20 s and 40 s, respectively. The 
estimative values are approached to the measured temperature by Epi-FM.

4.2 Separation efficiency improvement for mixed fluorescent dye  
This study presents systematical investigations into the sample separation 
levels with the conditions of the applied electric fields in a chip-based micro CE 
system. The separation performance was compared by the experimental results 
of the conventional DC electric field and the proposed pulse DC electric fields. 
Figure 16 presents the experimental and numerical results obtained for the 
electropherogram signal amplitude at a distance 2 cm downstream from the 
channel cross division when separating a mixed sample comprising 0.5 mM 
Rhodamine B and 1 mM Rhodamine 6G fluorescent dyes. The solid line 
represented the experiment results while the dotted line represented the 
numerical simulation results. Figure 16 (a) corresponds to the case in which the 
sample is separated using a conventional DC electric field, while Figure 16 
(b)~(f) present the results obtained using a pulse DC electric field with 
voltage-on durations of T1=100 ms, 80 ms, 60 ms, 50 ms and 40 ms, 
correspondingly, and a constant idle period of T2 = 50 ms. In every case, it can 
be seen that the electropherograms contain two peaks, corresponding to the two 
different fluorescent dyes. In other words, it is apparent that the two dyes are 
successfully separated using both the conventional DC electric field approach 
and the proposed pulse DC electric field technique. The two fragments within 
the sample have an electroosmotic mobility ratio of 0.764:1 (Rhodamine B: 
Rhodamine 6G), and hence the peak corresponding to the Rhodamine 6G dye is 
detected earlier than that of the Rhodamine B dye. The peaks corresponding to 
Rhodamine B are taller than those of Rhodamine 6G since, as discussed 
previously, the concentration of the Rhodamine B dye was adjusted such that it 
was 5 times higher than that of Rhodamine 6G. The peak intensity of the sample

cross division when the T2:T1 ratio is assigned a value in the range 0.5~1.25. In 
other words, given an appropriate specification of the pulse DC electric field 
parameters, the optimal CE separation performance can be obtained within a 
shorter separation channel length, which not only reduces the chip size, but also 
lowers the fabrication cost.

Figure 18 Electropherograms when separating the Hae III digested ΦX–174 
DNA ladder using conventional DC power supply mode and two pulse DC 
electric field profiles. The pulse DC power supply modes used were the optimal 
T2:T1 ratio, T2:T1=1, in the experiments of separating the mixed fluorescence 
dye. The separation levels for separating the 5a (271 bp) and 5b (281 bp) peaks 
in the DNA ladder using the DC, Case I pulse DC and Case II pulse DC electric 
fields were 78.9%, 108.1% and 121.6%, correspondingly. Note that the DC 
applied electric field is 300 V/cm in each case. 
 
The separation level is a commom and useful index for evaluating if two 
peaks were separated or not, especially when these two peaks were closed to 
each other, e.g. when the separation level was less than 1 (=100%). The 
calculated separation level varies directly with the distance between peaks and 
with the FWHM of the peaks in the electropherograms. The calculated

The red solid line represents the measured temperature variation under the 
conventional DC electric field and the blue dotted line represents the measured 
temperature variation under the pulse DC electric field mode of the optimal 
T2:T1 ratio, T2/T1=1:1, in the experiments of separating the mixed fluorescence 
dye (Figure 16). The DC applied electric field is 150 V/cm. Results show that 
the measured temperature variation under the DC electric field is higher than 
that under the pulse DC electric field of T2/T1=1:1. The results confirm that the 
Joule heat is reduced by using the pulse DC electric fields as compared with the 
DC electric field as the electrokinetically driven force in a CE microfluidic chip. 
Figure 20 presents the measured power under the conventional DC power 
supply mode and different pulse electric fields conditions used in Figure 17 and 
Table 1. The power was measured by measuring the variation of electric current 
provided in different electric fields conditions. The measured values of power 
under the conventional DC power supply mode are higher than those under 
different pulse DC electric fields conditions. In addition, the measured power 
decreases when the value of the T2 and T1 ratio increases. Increasing T2 and T1 
ratio means the proportion of the idle period in the total time of the applied 
electric field increases, which means the effect of using the proposed pulse DC 
electric field is more noticeable. The measured results of the temperature 
variation and the real power variation certainty confirm the effectiveness of the 
proposed pulse DC electric field method in reducing the produced Joule heat in 
a CE microfluidic chip.

conventional Epi-FM detection for measuring the temperature-dependent 
fluoresence dye. The measured temperature obtained using TIRFM was lower 
than the measured data obtained using Epi-FM, indicating significant 
temperature gradient occurred inside the microfluidic channel during the 
application of electric field. Results show the measured temperature gradient 
inside the microfluidic channel increased with the increasing applied electric 
field and with an increased application time of the electric fields. The 
temperatures obtained numerically were a bit lower than the temperatures 
obtained experimentally especially at high temperature regions due to lower 
temperature nearby the channel wall caused by the faster heat conduction. The 
measured temperature profile is feasible for being used as the exact boundary 
conditions for numerical modeling of the microfluidic system. This study not 
only gives a method to precisely measure the boundary temperature of channel 
wall, but further confirms the precise temperature profile of microfluidic 
channels caused by the Joule heating effect in microfluidic chips. Moreover, in 
order to reduce the Joule heating effect caused by the applied high voltage 
electric fields and enhance the separation efficiency of CE microchips, this 
research has presented a low-cost, straightforward method in the chip-based CE 
system by utilizing the pulse DC electric fields. The performance of the 
proposed driving scheme has been verified by conducting separation 
experiments using a mixed fluorescent dye sample and a DNA biosample, 
respectively. The experimental and numerical results have demonstrated the 
ability of the proposed method to separate a mixed sample of Rhodamine B and 
Rhodamine 6G; two fluoresceins with virtually identical physical properties. 
The calculated separation level for these two fluorescent dyes is up to 2.1-fold 
higher than those peaks obtained using conventional DC electric field. The

控制昆蟲飛行提供一個契機，不過，反過來問為何人類要控制昆蟲飛行呢??  
這是一個有趣的問題，Prof. Maharbiz 教授也提供的他的看法。基本上，自然
界的昆蟲其飛行的效率遠高於人造微型飛行器，現行所發展的微型人造飛行
裝置均無法穩定飛行，若能透過無線控制系統及反饋感測迴路對昆蟲飛行進
行控制，則其將是一個非常有效率的微型飛行器。本次演講最令人感到深刻
的部分是，Prof.   將電刺激晶片及一些光學感測元件均已經完成 IC 設計及
製作，並已經直接固定於昆蟲背上，算是一個整合程度相當高的原件。 
    因應今年的諾貝爾物理獎的公佈，大會特別開出了兩場 special sessions，
主要是利用石墨烯進行感測應用。其實，graphene 這種材料已經是一個典型的
感測器材料，因為獲得今年的諾貝爾物理獎，所以特別又被舉出來討論。看
來石墨烯的未來應用，將會有一段時期的熱度。

ELECTRONICS。演講的前半段為介紹發展生醫感測器時所需考量的一些設計
重點，並說明許多相關的法令規章，屬於較通則性的介紹。演講的後半段為
吳校長所帶領的團隊，發展的各式神經傳導量測用系統，包括各種微探針

技術說明
(中文) 本發明利用一無電鍍技術沈積鈀金屬於一具有奈米孔洞之聚碳酸酯薄膜，因聚碳
酸酯具非催化之特性，故需先活化其表面使鈀金屬能附著於奈米孔洞之表面，進
而堆積形成奈米組合電極。 
奈米組合電極於電化學安培偵測法中可提高其擴散速率以增加電極靈敏度，並可
以產生較低且穩定的背景電流，有利於降低偵測極限，電極的訊雜比（S/N 
ratio）提高將有利於分析物的偵測。 
於電化學安培偵測法中，施加的分離電壓所產生之電泳電流將會遠大於微電極所
測得的分析物之氧化或還原電流，故於工作電極前置一導電界面，使電泳電流由
此導出接地，降低其對偵測器之干擾。然而，分離電壓之高電場易電解水並於接
地端產生氫氣阻斷迴路或使電泳電流分流至工作電極，造成背景電流增大，因此，
為了避免氣泡的產生與聚集，可利用鈀具有吸附氫氣的性質，將鈀作為電泳晶片
安培偵測之導電界面，有效的導掉接地端表面因高電壓作用而產生的氫氣，使電
泳電流對於工作電極的干擾降到最小。 
鑑於以上因素，本發明所製作之鈀奈米組合電極將能有效提高靈敏度及訊雜比，
降低電泳電流及其所產生氫氣之干擾，避免使其影響偵測之準確度。
