Abstract: 
Maintaining reconstructed signal with desired quality is crucial for ECG data compression. 
In this project, a linear quality control design based on the Reversible Round-Off 
Non-Recursive Discrete Periodized Wavelet Transform (RRO-NRDPWT) is proposed for 
high efficient wavelet-based ECG data compression. With the advantages of error propagation 
resistance and octave coefficient normalization, RRO-NRDPWT enables the non-linear 
quantization control to obtain an approximately linear distortion by using a single control 
variable. Based on the linear programming, a linear quantization scale prediction model is 
presented for the quality control of reconstructed ECG signal. Following the use of the 
MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the experimental results show that the proposed system, with 
lower computational complexity, can obtain much better quality control performance than that 
of other wavelet-based systems.

Abstract—In this paper, a fast quality-on-demand (QOD) 
algorithm for wavelet-based electrocardiogram (ECG) signal 
compression is proposed. The algorithm based on the 1-D 
reversible round-off non-recursive discrete periodized wavelet 
transform (1-D RRO-NRDPWT) and an approximately linear 
compression performance design to build a linear prediction 
model for quantization scale refinement. The convergence of 
quality control is verified to be always held. By using the 
MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the experimental results show 
that the proposed method can effectively improved the 
computational complexity and convergence speed of quality 
control.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
lectrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis is a non-invasive 
modality widely used for heart disease diagnosis. The 
home care and medication of cardiac crucially rely on 
long-term recording and ambulatory monitoring of ECG 
signal. To this end, many ECG data compression methods 
have been proposed for the demands of real-time data 
transmission and mass data storage. Recently, the 
wavelet-based approach has attracted much attention from 
researchers [1-7] due to simplicity and high compression 
performance. 
In ECG data compression, quality control is an important 
issue that requires a reconstructed signal keeping at the 
desired quality. The percentage root mean square difference 
(PRD) is usually used for quality criterion. Data compression 
methods based on fixed bit rate or fixed quantization scale 
design, generally, can not satisfy the requirement due to the 
non-stationary property of ECG signals varying with complex 
pattern. If the quality of the retrieved ECG signal is not 
guaranteed, the compressed data will be useless. 
An ECG signal compression with quality control function 
should include an error control loop. The error control loop is

an iterative process used to limit the distortion of every 
segment data in an error bound. For this purpose, many 
quality control strategies were proposed for ECG data 
compression [1, 2, 4, 6]. Based on the set partitioning in 
hierarchical trees (SPIHT) compression scheme [3], 
SPIHT-based QOD algorithm [4] used Newton-Raphson 
prediction for quality control. This method required 
embedding the inverse SPIHT and inverse DWT processes in 
the error control loop. This method obtains high quality 
control performance at the cost of computation complexity. 
In this paper, we proposed a fast QOD algorithm based on 
the 1-D RRO-NRDPWT ECG data compression system [7]. 
The 1-D RRO-NRDPWT associates the non-recursive 1-D 
discrete periodized wavelet transform (1-D NRDPWT) and a 
reversible round-off linear transformation (RROLT) theorem. 
The use of 1-D NRDPWT and RROLT is to resist error 
propagation effect and normalize the significance of octave 
coefficients, respectively. Traditional 1-D DWT applying 
recursive pyramid decomposition process will induce serious 
error propagation due to word-length-growth effect. The error 
propagation of high octave quantization error is the main 
factor that causes compression performance rapidly 
descended in high CR situation. The 1-D RRO-NRDPWT can 
facilitate a non-linear quantization scheme design with a 
single variable control and an approximately linear 
compression performance result. Based on the quantization 
scheme, a linear quantization scale prediction algorithm is 
presented in this paper. This error control method doesn’t 
need the inverse-SPIHT process. The experimental results 
show that the new QOD algorithm can effectively lower 
computation complexity and improve convergence speed in 
comparing with the SPIHT-based algorithm [4].

VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
For compression performance evaluation, a dataset 
including the 11 ECG signals: 100, 101, 102, 103, 107, 109, 
111, 115, 117, 118, and 119, in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
database [10], are suggested in [3] for testing signals. Each 
signal contains about 10-min length of sampled data. We use 
the 6-tap Daubechies’ filter for RRO-NRDPWT and a 
segment involves 1024 samples (N=1024). The comparison 
of the three methods of Benzid et al. [5], SPIHT [3], and 
proposed method is shown in Fig. 3. The Fig. 3 shows that the 
proposed method has better compression performance than 
SPIHT, particularly in high CR situation. The MIT-BIH: 231 
signal is used in the proposed method for visual inspection. 
The original, reconstructed, and error signals of the first 2048 
samples are shown in Fig. 4. The PRD=6.01% and CR=16.48 
are obtained when QF=11. The both amplitudes and durations 
of clinical features are preserved well in the reconstructed 
signal.
