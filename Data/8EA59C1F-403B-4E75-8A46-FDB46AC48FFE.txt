由於醫療科技與人類文明的進步造成全球高齡人口的增加，使骨質疏鬆症
成為全世界第二大流行病學，導致骨質疏鬆相關脊椎病變患者劇增。在 2000 年
全球共有 4,400 萬的人罹患骨質疏鬆症，脊椎骨折占了 140 萬人。臨床上以傳統骨
釘來治療骨質疏鬆脊椎骨折，其椎弓骨釘固定系統在受力後常產生鬆脫
(Pull-out)的情形，因此如何增加骨釘與海綿骨之界面強度來穩定骨質疏鬆的脊
椎是臨床上常面對的難題。本研究目的為研發設計適用於骨鬆椎骨之骨水泥錨定
型椎弓骨釘，其特定目標：(1) 設計研發 3D 骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘模型；(2) 模擬分
析骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘植入三節椎體之生物力學特性。 
 
本研究主要分為四個階段：(1) 依據功能性需求利用 CAD 進行設計適合骨鬆患
者之骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘，並進行雛型製作。(2) 利用椎弓骨釘配合骨水泥植入
假骨進行骨水泥擴散實驗來驗証其可行性，並以長度、寬度及體積來量化其擴
散分佈，且應用 solidworks 重建骨水泥擴散模型。(3) 利用 MTS 進行椎弓骨釘
配合骨水泥植入假骨之生物力學抗拉強度測試共分為 12 組，探討各組間拉出強
度及拉出能量並以 One-way ANOVA 分析其差異性。(4)以有限元素法模擬分析
骨泥錨定型骨釘植入椎骨(包括至少三節椎骨)及灌入骨水泥生物力學特性。 
 
結果顯示：(1)在抗拉強度下骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘相較於傳統骨釘其最大應力
增加 5%，骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘相較於傳統骨釘在總反作用力減少 6%。在抗彎強度
下骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘相較於傳統骨釘其應力增加 3%，但在位移下骨泥錨定型椎弓
骨釘相較於傳統骨釘增加 3%。(2)骨水泥的灌注對傳統骨釘、中空骨釘及錨定型椎
弓骨釘的拉出強度與拉出能量皆有顯著性差異(P<0.05)。(3)椎弓骨釘配合骨水泥
植入三節椎體模型之分析可得知傳統骨釘及骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘當增加骨水泥的
灌注時，可明顯的降低整體的最大應力 27%至 44%。 
 
本研究結果建議在治療骨質疏鬆相關脊椎病變時，骨水泥錨定型椎弓骨釘配合
骨水泥可有效的加強其固定效果，且骨水泥量愈多其固定效果愈佳。未來可針對本
研究之骨泥錨定型椎弓骨釘進行 cadver 生物力學及動物實驗，以提供完整的資料作
為臨床治療骨質疏鬆脊椎病變的另一種選擇。 
 
Abstract 
 
Because of improvement and development of the medical technology, the dramatic increase 
of aged population and associated osteoporosis has lead to increase patients with spinal trauma 
and related spinal disorder. In 2000, the America National Osteoporosis Foundation reported that 
there are over 140,000 vertebral fractures annually. The transpecicle screw system has been 
widely used to treat spinal disorder in the past two decades. Loosing or pullout of the pedicle

INTRODUCTION 
 
Functionally, the spine mainly supports the body axis and transmits the weight of the trunk 
to the lower limbs. It surrounds and protects the spinal cord and provides attachment for the ribs, 
and ligaments and muscles of the neck and back to perform physiologic mobility and activities of 
daily living for reducing injury to bones, soft tissues, or neurologic structures [4]. With the advent 
of medical technology, the dramatic increase of aging population and associated osteoporosis has 
lead to increased patients with spinal trauma and related spinal disorder. In 2002, America 
National Osteoporosis Foundation reported that there are over 500,000 vertebral compression 
fractures annually, and more than one fourth of American women older than 65 years of age 
suffer from vertebral compression fractures [3, 12, 18, 20, 21, 23]. In 2006, Taiwan Department 
of Health reported that 12.5% of aged male and 20% of aged female suffer from vertebral 
compression fracture due to osteoporosis.  
 
Currently pedicle screw instrumentation has been frequently used for spinal reconstruction, 
fixation, correction and coupling decompression in spinal trauma and related spinal disorder 
surgery [10, 24, 27]. However, the conventional screw is unable to provide enough screw-bone 
interface strength for osteoporotic cancellous bone, and complications resulted from loosening or 
failure of the implants remain a significant clinical issue [6, 11, 17]. Many studies have showed 
the evidence that the stiffness and strength of pedicle screw fixation can be significantly 
increased with the pedicle screw augmented with various cements. Polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA) has advantages such as availability, inexpensiveness, short application time, and 
appropriate fixation strength for clinical application. The proper use of PMMA has been proved 
to be a safe and reliable material for pedicle screw augmentation. However, conventional pedicle 
screw augmentation with PMMA has still remained some potential problems in clinical practices, 
such as elaborate surgical procedures and unable to adjust the position of cemented pedicle screw.  
 
The advent of computer-aided engineering, precise manufacture, finite element analysis, 
better understanding in osteoporosis, and advanced technique in spinal surgery provides a novel 
bone cement anchoraged thoracolumbar pedicle screw design and seems to become potentially 
useful to enhance fixation strength for osteoporotic spine and simplified surgical procedures. The 
contributions may be significant to clinical and biomechanical sciences as well as medical 
instrumentation to osteoporotic spine. 
 
 
 
using bone cement augmentation for group D, five designed pedicle screws with a cannulated 
central hole using bone cement augmentation for group E, and five designed pedicle screws with 
a cannulated central hole using bone cement augmentation, followed by a matched central pin 
insertion for group F. 
 
The experimental method is used to measure the axial pullout strength and energy required 
to fail or remove pedicle screws from the sawbone test block. Each specimen is mounted onto a 
material testing system (HUNG TA 2402BP) through a custom-made clamping device with 3D 
adjustment. The 3D adjustment makes it possible to compensate for the variation in pedicle screw 
orientation among specimens quickly and easily, and ensure each pedicle screw is pulled purely 
along its long axis. Before tightening the device, careful alignment of the test fixture is made to 
ensure that the force induced on the screw during clamping is minimal. The test block clamp is 
connected with a metal bar which has an inner thread with a same dimension of the nut to firmly 
lock outer thread inside the screw head (Figure 2). 
 
 
 
Similar to the experiment for bone cement distribution, the synthetic bone (Test block, 
Model: #1522-507, Pacific Research Laboratory Inc., Vashon Island, WA, USA) is used with a 
rectangular shape (test block) of 78 x 70 x 42 mm
3
 for biomechanical pullout test. The test blocks 
with pedicle screws insertion are examined and compared for the pullout strength related to either 
method of pedicle screw fixation (with or without PMMA bone cement augmentation). The 
pullout strength using bone cement augmentation with different volumes (2, 3, and 4 mL) is also 
investigated.

 Numerous in-vitro investigations using synthetic cancellous bone as a substitute for 
cadaveric specimens have shown that synthetic cancellous bone is a good predictor of the 
mechanical characteristics in real patients. Johnson and Keller investigated the comprehensive 
mechanical properties of synthetic vertebrae, and they concluded that synthetic open-cell foam 
vertebrae offer researchers an alternative to human vertebral bone for static and dynamic 
biomechanical experiments, including studies examining the effects of bone cement injection [13]. 
Zdero and Schemitsch examined the effects of screw pullout rate on cancellous bone screw 
purchase strength in synthetic cancellous bone cubes [30]. Their results indicated that failure 
force, failure stress, and resistance force were highly linearly correlated with pullout rate. The use 
of synthetic cancellous bone simplifies the experimental set-up, limiting experimental error. It 
provides a consistent test platform (independent of bone variation) for comparing screw designs 
with different numbers of radial holes. Cancellous bone generally reported to have a density in 
the range of 0.09-1.25 g/cm
3
. The synthetic bone material used in this study has a density of 0.12 
g/cm
3
, which is chosen to model osteoporotic spinal vertebrae.  
 
Many experimental studies demonstrated that various bone cement such as PMMA, 
hydroxyl apatite, calcium sulfate, and calcium phosphate are effective in augmentation of pedicle 
screw. Among these cements, PMMA is the most available, cost effective, and has been used in 
many orthopedic applications for decades. Some studies comment that PMMA has stronger 
augmentation power than calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate in primary screw augmentation 
[19, 21]. Other studies report that PMMA could increase pullout strength up to 96% to 262% and 
transverse bending stiffness up to 153% [22, 26, 29, 30]. Recently, many non-PMMA or 
biodegradable substitutes have been developed and proved to increase the pullout strength 30% to 
90% [1, 5, 9, 15, 26]. However, those non-PMMA bone cement have to wait at least 4 to 24 hours 
to reach the appropriate strength and stiffness for screw augmentation.  
 
In clinical practice, quick setting of bone cement with maximal fixation strength is 
mandatory and necessary during assembling of the spinal construct, especially when compression 
and distraction force for correcting the spinal deformity is needed. If the pedicle screw fixation is 
not rigid enough, immediate loosening of the construct can occur, especially in patients with 
severe osteoporosis. Therefore, the delayed setting of biodegradable bone cements is not 
appropriate and may limit their clinical application.  
 
The optimal amount of bone cement augmentation for each pedicle screw is not known. 
However, both safety and strength of augmentation must be balanced. Theoretically, the higher 
strength of pedicle screw fixation can be obtained with the larger amount of injected bone cement, 
addition to systemic medications for osteoporosis and new implant designs, the success of 
recently emerging techniques, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty, balloon kyphoplasty, or 
pedicle screw instrumentation using bone cement augmentation, for the treatment of compression 
fracture or osteoporosis related spinal disorder, have driven physicians to consider surgery in 
conditions previously thought with difficulties or no help. However, it is still a challenge for 
spinal surgeons to operate on the osteoporotic spine. 
 
Careful following the underlying principles of conceptual and optimal design, a novel bone 
cement anchoraged pedicle screw is developed. The feasibility and performance of the pedicle 
screw prototype is proved by using sawbone test block of compromised quality empirically and 
analytically. A finite element method is also employed to examine the geometric structure and 
validate the experimental results. Through the comprehensive research of this study, the use of 
the bone cement anchoraged pedicle screw can effectively enhance the fixation strength and 
stability in sawbone test block with compromised quality, either finite element analysis or 
biomechanical testing.  
 
In clinical practice, the bone cement anchoraged pedicle screw design may have advantages of 
secure pedicle screw fixation which can decrease the instrumented and fusion segments, and 
shorten the wound incision and operative time. This leads patients with osteoporosis who require 
spinal surgery can early return to their activities of daily living and improve quality of life, 
therefore, decreasing the medical and social cost. However, the efficiency and convenience of the 
bone cement anchoraged pedicle screw for clinical application in osteoporotic spinal surgeries 
need further investigation. The author concludes that the bone cement anchoraged pedicle screw 
using PMMA bone cement augmentation may be a viable clinical option for instrumentation in 
severe osteoporotic spine.
