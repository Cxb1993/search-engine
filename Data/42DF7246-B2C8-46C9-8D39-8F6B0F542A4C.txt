thoroughly. The height of transfer unit of the 
system was deducted as a function of the tested 
parameters that can be used for designing a NOx 
scrubbing system. The absorption of NO2 is not 
sensitive 
to the inlet NO2 concentration. However, as 
expected, the NO2 absorption increases with the 
increase of L/G ratio. An L/G greater than 2.5 is 
essential to a practical NO2 scrubbing application. 
The pilot test suggested that the scrubbing solution 
is 
with Na2S concentration greater than 0.0015 M at 
pH 9. The solution effectively removed more than 
90% of the incoming NO2 in the five-foot height 
packed bed scrubber. The study also indicates that a 
gas residence time of 4.5 s is essential to achieve 
more than 80% NO2 absorption. 
英文關鍵詞： NOx, Absorption, Control 
 
Recently, non-thermal plasmas are under intense
investigation for the oxidation of NO in the ﬁrst stage
[3]. After the NO is oxidized to NO2 in the ﬁrst stage,
a second stage for NO2 absorption is critical for the
technology to be effective for NOx control.
The advantage of a wet scrubbing system is that
the system removes NOx as well as sulfur dioxide
in the ﬂue gas [4–7]. However, the major challenge
for the technology is the low solubility of NO. Usu-
ally, the NO must be oxidized to NO2 in the ﬂue gas
before a reasonable degree of absorption can occur
in an aqueous system [8–15]. A pilot-scale ﬁeld test
for NO2 absorption with Na2SO3 was performed to
collect operational parameters for industrial applica-
tion [16]. Since Na2SO3 is a derivative of Na2S, it is
desirable to understand the effectiveness of Na2S for
NO2 absorption [17]. In this study, a pilot test was
performed for the NO2 absorption with aqueous Na2S
solution. The objective of this study is to establish
pilot test data for the design and operation of the
NOx scrubbing system. How the considered parame-
ters, the concentrations of Na2S in the scrubbing solu-
tion, liquid/gas ratio, pH of the aqueous solution, gas
ﬂow velocity, and residence time affected the NOx
absorption performance were thoroughly investi-
gated. The heights of the transfer unit correspondent
to the parameters for the design of the NOx absorp-
tion system were also deducted.
PROCESS CHEMISTRY
The overall chemical reactions for the absorption
of NO2 by Na2S solution can be described by the fol-
lowing reactions [18]:
S2 þ H2OðlÞ $ HS þOH (1)
NO2 þ HS $ NO2 þ HS (2)
2NOðgÞ þO2ðgÞ ! 2NO2ðgÞ (3)
N2O4ðgÞ ! N2O4ðlÞ (4)
N2O4ðlÞ þ H2OðlÞ $ HNO2ðlÞ þHNO3ðlÞ ! NO2 þ NO3
(5)
The study indicated that at high pH condition,
the reactions favor the absorption of NO2 in the
Na2S aqueous solutions. More S
22 ions are dissoci-
ated from Na2S solution at pH 9 than that at neutral
or acidic conditions. The dominating reactions of
NO2 absorption are reactions (1) and (2). The study
also indicated that NO2 absorption is most likely
through hydrolysis of N2O4 as presented in reactions
(5).
CHEMICAL ABSORPTION
The column height, ZT of an absorption pack
tower, can be expressed as below:
ZT ¼

y  y (6)
where y is gas molar fraction of absorbate, A is the
cross-sectional area of absorption tower, V is gas
molar ﬂow rate, Kya is the overall mass transfer coef-
ﬁcient, dZ is differential height, and a, b are the inte-
gration location along the tower, respectively. The
integral in Eq. 6 represents the change in vapor con-
centration divided by the average driving force and is
represented as the number of transfer units, NTU.
The other part of the Eq. 6 has the unit of length and
is represented as the height of transfer unit, HTU.
The chemical reaction in the liquid phase reduced
the equilibrium partial pressure of the solute over the
solution, which generally increases the driving force
for mass transfer. If the reaction is essentially irrever-
sible at absorption conditions, the equilibrium partial
pressure is zero, and the NTU can be calculated just
from the change in gas composition. For y* 5 0,

The rate of absorption of NO2 can be evaluated by

implicitly included in HTU.
EXPERIMENT
The NO2 absorption tests were carried out at a pilot
plant built by Kunstoff Manufacturer, Co. Figure 1
shows the schematic of the pilot-scale ﬂue gas scrub-
bing system. The system consists of a gas blending
unit, a packed bed scrubber, a chemical injection and
control system, and a NOx monitoring unit. The gas
blending unit is capable of producing a wide variety of
gas compositions by mixing air with high concentration
NO2 from cylinders. The NO2-containing air stream is
then passed through the scrubbing tower where the
NO2 absorption takes place. Samples are taken to mon-
itor the inlet and outlet concentrations of NO2 under
various settings of parameters to determine the optimal
conditions for NO2 absorption with the Na2S aqueous
solutions, and to obtain HTU and Kya information for
the absorption process design reference.
The gas blending system is capable of a total ﬂow
rate of 45 m3/min (1600 cfm). The NO2 concentra-
tions are varied by injecting NO2 from a 5% gas cylin-
der through a mass ﬂow meter. The whole system is
made of ﬁberglass reinforced plastic, including the
blower, except for the NO2 lines which are polypro-
pylene tubing. After the NO2 is injected into the air
stream, the whole stream is passed into a section of
Tellerete Packing to have a better mixing. The well

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A series of tests were ﬁrst conducted to identify a
suitable inlet concentration range for further parame-
ters study. Various inlet concentrations, ranging from
25 to 100 ppm were tested in the system to deter-
mine their effect on the NO2 absorption. Within the
range of 25 and 100 ppm, NO2 absorption was rela-
tively stable at different inlet concentrations. The tests
conﬁrmed that the system performance become less
sensitive to the change of inlet NO2 concentrations
when the NO2 concentration is over 50 ppm as
shown in Figure 2. Thus, an inlet concentration of
50 ppm was chosen for further study.
A set of experiments was conducted to explore the
effect of gas and liquid mass ﬂow rates on NO2 absorp-
tion. Experiments were conducted at constant NO2 in
the gas phase and Na2S, pH in the scrubbing solutions.
The gas mass rate was varied from 1296.1 to 5184.2
kg/m2-h, and the liquid mass rate was tested in a range
between 2440 and 9760 kg/m2-h. The NO2 absorption
was found to drop signiﬁcantly when liquid mass ﬂow
rate is reduced from 9760 kg/m2-h to 2440 kg/m2-h as
shown in Figure 3. When comparing NO2 absorption
change among different liquid mass ﬂow rate, we
found the NO2 absorption becomes less sensitive to
liquid mass ﬂow rate as the rate is over 4880 kg/m2-h.
At a aqueous mass rate of 4880 kg/m2-h, more than
80% of the incoming NO2 was absorbed into the scrub-
bing solution when the gas mass ﬂow rate was kept at
1944.2 kg/m2-h. Hence the gas mass ﬂow rate of
1944.2 kg/m2-h was chosen for further experiment.
With a liquid mass ﬂow rate at 4880 kg/m2-h and
a gas mass ﬂow rate is below 2592 kg/m2-h, a 65%
NO2 absorption was achieved as indicated in Figure
3. There is a 15% decrease of the NO2 absorption
among each increase of gas mass ﬂow rate. A reason-
able gas–liquid contact time in the packed bed is
essential for the operation. To test extreme condi-
tions, the least liquid mass ﬂow rate of 2440 kg/m2-h
was pumped through the packed bed at the maxi-
mum gas mass ﬂow rate of 5184 kg/m2-h. A less 60%
NO2 absorption was found in the test. This indicates
that there is a lower limit for liquid mass ﬂow rate
and an upper limit for gas mass ﬂow rate to be kept
to maintain an acceptable NO2 absorption perform-
ance in the scrubbing system. To achieve more than
60% NO2 absorption, this study indicates that the
lower limit for the liquid mass ﬂow rate is 4880 kg/
m2-h and the upper limit for the gas mass ﬂow rate is
2592 kg/m2-h. For design reference, the HTU of the
NO2 absorption system under various gas and liquid
mass rates with Na2S concentration of 0.002 M was
provided in Figure 4.
To illustrate the effect of liquid and gas mass rate on
NO2 conversion, a combined parameter, liquid-to-gas
ratio (L/G) can be introduced. The NO2 absorption at
various pH with respect to L/G ratios are illustrated in
Figure 5. As can be expected, NO2 absorption increases
with the increasing of L/G ratio. For L/G 5 1, there is
49% NO2 absorption and is independent of the pH in
the scrubbing solutions. For the condition of L/G 5
1.88, only when pH at 9 results in more than 60% NO2
absorption. At an L/G greater than 2.51 for pH at 9.0,

absorption.

absorption.

the other hand, when the gas residence time was
increased to 4.1 s at pH 9, an 80% NO2 absorption
was achievable. If a 60% NO2 absorption is required
to comply with local regulations, a 4.1 s of gas resi-
dence time is essential.
Gas velocity can be calculated from gas ﬂow rate and
the dimension of the tower. The scrubber removed 60%
of the incoming NO2 for a gas velocity at 0.45 m/s under
different pH conditions as shown in Fig. 10. However,
when gas velocity was increased from 0.45 m/s to 1.19
m/s, the NO2 absorption dropped below 45%. On the
other hand, if gas velocity was at 0.3 m/s, less than 0.41
m/s, 80% of the incoming NO2 was absorbed into the
scrubbing solution. As stated before, the system requires
a sufﬁcient contact time between gas and liquid phases
to complete the chemical absorption process. Since gas
velocity is closely related with the gas residence time, a
scrubber volume has to be speciﬁed tomeet the required
removal efﬁciency. This usually depends on individual
design consideration. In this pilot test, a gas velocity of
0.45m/s or a residence time of 4.1 s is recommended.
A previous study suggested that Na2SO3 aqueous
solutions are good media for NO2 absorption as well
[3]. Two systems for NO2 absorption are compared in
Figure 11. The comparison indicates that Na2SO3
aqueous solutions are superior to Na2S aqueous solu-
tions in NO2 absorption capability. At a certain L/G
ratio, the NO2 absorption increased about 15% when
the concentration of Na2SO3 was increased from 0.15
M to 0.25 M. With the same concentration of 0.015 M,
Na2SO3 solution is superior to Na2S solution in NO2
absorption. When the L/G ratio is greater than 3, a
higher NO2 absorption was measured with Na2S sys-
tem; however, the difference between the two sys-
tems is insigniﬁcant. Since the molecular weight of
Na2S is less than that of Na2SO3, when both NO2
absorption efﬁciency and the chemical consumption
cost are considered; Na2S system is competitive with
Na2SO3 for NOx absorption.
The results from this study are also compared with
the results of a laboratory scale test performed by Shen
and Rochelle [19]. Table 2 shows the difference
between the two studies. The comparison indicates that
wider variations of NO2 absorption were conducted in
this pilot-scale test. The results from the pilot-scale
study are comparable with that from a bench-scale.
This study has lay out a solid foundation for scrubber
design by providing all of the important parameters
such as concentration and pH of scrubber solution,
liquid and gas mass rate, and the gas residence time.
CONCLUSIONS
This pilot-scale study of NO2 absorption by Na2S
aqueous solution is concluded with the following
ﬁndings:
 To maintain high NO2 absorption, the gas mass
ﬂow rate needs to be kept at less than 1944.2 kg/
m2-h and the liquid mass ﬂow rate has to be over
7320 kg/m2-h.
 When L/G ratio is greater than 2.51, the scrubbing
system can achieve more than 90% of NO2
absorption.
