一、 研究目的與文獻探討 
在許多創新前瞻之研究中，新穎設計兼具結構及材料上創新的進階光纖元件，廣泛應用在光電
奈米科技、生醫技術與精密感測等，吸引了各學術界研究者的矚目。其中，具有極化特性光纖
元件在光纖通訊、鎖模光纖雷射以及特定感測系統的應用上極為重要，在文獻上，可以產生在
光纖中傳遞固定偏振態的極化光的光纖極化器元件，早期多是利用(1)、表面電漿共振之側磨光
纖[1-10]、(2)、具雙折射性薄膜材料覆鍍於側磨光纖或tapered 特殊結構雙折射光纖[11-16]
以及(3)、光纖光柵寫在特殊結構雙折射光纖[17-20]的結構為多，上述中，第(1)、需精良側磨
技術以及鍍膜(蒸鍍或是濺鍍)相關技術，複雜度高，第(2)則須特殊雙折射光纖，需要特製的
preform 抽絲，造價並不便宜，至於第(3)項的技術製作出來的光纖光柵光纖極化器元件，雖然
有較低的損耗，且全光纖式(all-fiber)，但侷限於光纖光柵本身特性其濾波頻寬窄，因此頻寬
都不寬，因此，應用價值有限。近期由於光子晶體光纖的盛起，利用一些光子晶體光纖[21,22]
為主體的結構之光纖極化器，已經被研究及探討著，Alkeskjold 等人於近期提出液晶式光子能
隙光纖，利用電調變液晶雙折射現象控制S/P 極化光的通過與否，此技術製程之極化元件雖然
頻寬高，但價格較昂貴且光的損耗很大、況且需複雜電極製鍍技術以及調變技術等[21]，2007 年
Wang 等人也提出利用CO2 雷射寫製長週期光纖光柵於光子晶體光纖上製程光纖極化器，聲稱所
提元件對環境溫度不靈敏，但是頻寬只有 11nm、消光比最大只有20dB 而已[22]。總而言之，
上述光纖極化器不是元件結構複雜、價格昂貴、製作困難度高，便是無法達到超寬頻、大範圍
可調波長同時具備的多項優點。 
本計畫擬設計及製作出一個新穎型超寬頻可調式、高消光比以及具有極化特性之長週期光纖光
柵元件，此元件可以作為一高性能之光纖極化器。主要想法是將拉格朗日演算法優化設計之超
寬頻長週期光纖光柵(LPG)設計在一個之具雙折射性之薄纖殼光纖上，薄纖殼的產生可以利用氫
氟酸蝕刻，從纖殼直徑125μm到約40μm，薄纖殼LPG 之主要作用可以消去眾多纖殼模態
(cladding modes)的共振在極寬頻域(1300nm~1700nm)只有單一纖殼模態共振(single cladding 
mode resonance)避免LPG 之鄰近許多高階纖殼模態的共振損失，此元件稱之為超寬頻單一共振
模態之長週期光纖光柵(Ultra broadband LPG: UBLPG)，本計畫擬將此元件製作在高雙折射之
橢圓纖心光纖上，便是一個具有選擇光極化性、具應用價值的元件了

利用上述橢圓纖心光纖理論，將長周期光纖光柵寫在core中，預期可以優化設計出高Extinction

析如下: 
The radiuses of ECF are set at 8μm (long axis: a) and 6μm (short axis: b), respectively. Calculated 
effective refractive index of LP01 (only even mode existed), LP (even and odd modes) and LP21 02 
guided modes can be obtained by the Eq. (1) and shown in Fig. 6(a). Phase-matching grating periods 
versus the coupling wavelengths between the LP coupling modes of ECLPG are shown in Fig. 6(b). 
For the reason of the coupling coefficient between LP and LP01 21 odd mode is zero shown in Fig.7, 
therefore when 265μm of LPG grating pitch is selected, LP01 will be coupled into LP21 even mode at 
resonant wavelength is 1.5μm. The coupling factors between LP modes are calculated and shown in 
Fig.7. The coupling strength of LP  and LP01 21 coupling is larger than that of LP01 and LP02 because of 
mode filed of higher order mode, LP02 is stretched-out into cladding region more greatly than LP21 
mode. The designed transmission spectra of optimal ECLPG by the use of dB-scale LMO are shown 
in Fig. 8(a). It shows that a 30dB PER, broadband, 200nm in -20dB and 120nm in -30dB, polarized 
ECLPG can be achieved. Designed index modulations (Δn) from the relation, ηλπκ ⋅Δ= n  can be 
obtained for the ECLPG. The profile is Sinc function- alike and not complicated which can be easily 
achieved and fabricated by using the UV-writing technology on ECF is shown in Fig. 3(b). On the 
other hand, the optimal TAP condition is occurred in LP01 and LP02 coupling if grating period is 
99.86μm has central wavelength 1.625μm. It can be seen in Fig.9, transmission response of a 
Gaussian-apodized, 8cm-ECLPG with bandwidth only about 40nm in -20dB is obtained for 
comparison.

結論 
We have used the weakly guiding approximation to calculate and analyze the cutoff frequencies of the 
first six even and odd LP modes, and their intensity distributions on the cross section with different 
aspect ratio of elliptical core fibers. From the theoretical simulation results, modal propagation 
characteristics of the few guided LP modes can be evidently understood and completely realized. 
More importantly, for the first time, coupling factors between the linearly polarized (LP) modes are 
calculated and analyzed in this present study. Furthermore, for the first time, a high polarization 
extinction ratio (about 30dB), spectrally flat and broadband (200nm in -20dB) polarized ECLPG by 
the design of dB-scale LMO method is presented and demonstrated in this paper. Based on the 
Coupling factor between LP01 fundamental mode and high order LPmn modes are analyzed in the 
present study. From the simulation results, the LP01 fundamental mode the performance of 
birefringence can be further enhanced if the aspect ratio of ECF became larger. We believe such a 
novel device can be very useful for many polarized applications in fiber optics.

We have analyzed diﬀerent inverse design algorithms for the synthesis problems of ﬁber gratings. An example of dense
wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) multichannel ﬁber Bragg grating (MCFBG) for optical ﬁber communi-
cation was synthesized and simulation results were analyzed and compared with use of the discrete layer-peeling (DLP)
inverse scattering algorithm and Lagrange-multiplier constrained optimization (LMCO) algorithm. Simulation results
show the LMCO method was more ﬂexible than the DLP method. # 2009 The Optical Society of Japan
Keywords: multi-channel ﬁber Bragg grating (MCFBG), discrete layer-peeling (DLP) algorithm, Lagrange-multiplier
constrained optimization (LMCO) algorithm
1. Introduction
Due to the increasing demand for transmission capacity,
the channel spacing of two adjacent dense wavelength-
division-multiplexing (DWDM) channels has been as small
as 50/25GHz because of limited by the bit rate. For such
small channel spacing, it is not easy to build narrow-
bandwidth OADM/MUX/DEMUX ﬁlters that can separate
diﬀerent channels with small cross-talks and large usable
bandwidth ratios. The ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG) based
device technology is one of the available technologies that
can meet the required performance. Among these ﬁlters,
superstructure or sampled FBGs are especially attractive for
DWDM applications in the existing long-haul ﬁber network
due to their comb and multichannel spectrum responses.1,2)
However, in comparison to a single channel grating,
manufacture of an N-channel FBG device requires greater
variation of the photo-induced refractive index change. In
fact, it has been shown that the total index change is directly
proportional to the number of constituent gratings to be
written, N times higher than a single channel grating.2) Since
the maximum index change in a silica glass by UV irradiation
is on the order of 0.001, there is an upper bound in the
practical fabrication on the number of gratings that can be
written by the superposition method. By employing the
powerful inverse design methodology, it is possible to design
multichannel FBG (MCFBG) ﬁlters with large channel
numbers. The designed MCFBG ﬁlters that can achieve the
best performance are typically multi-phase-shifted FBGs
with complicated proﬁles of coupling coeﬃcients and long
lengths. Special UV exposure setups are thus required to
fabricate these complicated devices with the targeted
performance. In 2003, Li and Sheng presented the inverse
scattering discrete layer-peeling (DLP) algorithm for the
direct design of multichannel ﬁber gratings with an additional
simulated annealing optimization process for diﬀerent
channel phases.3) Recently, the Lagrange-multiplier con-
strained optimization (LMCO) algorithm has been utilized to
design MCFBGs for DWDM technology.4) The proposed
LMCOmethod constrains various parameters of the designed
devices for practical application demands through a user-
deﬁned functional cost. The user-deﬁned cost function in the
proposed method can be able to deﬁne to meet demands of
the designed devices for practical fabrication, for example,
shorter grating length, lower index modulation of the grating.
Although the complicated ﬁber grating based ﬁlters; espe-
cially MCFBGs, can be inversely designed using the above
methods, however, the compared simulation results and
theoretical discussions of the problems of such inverse design
for complicated ﬁber gratings have not appeared in published
papers so far. Therefore, in this paper, a comparative analysis
of designed MCFBGs with the DLP and LMCO inverse
design algorithms is presented. Our simulation results for the
synthesis of the designed ﬁlters found that, when compared to
the DLP algorithm, the LMCO method can easily embed
various constraints in the cost functional of the algorithm
for more ﬂexible on the designed characteristics. Moreover,
by varying the weighting parameters in the user-deﬁned
cost functional, the index modulation requirements can be
controlled to meet practical fabrication conditions using the
commercially available photosensitive ﬁbers.
2. Discussion of Design Methods for MCFBGs and
Results
Simulation results of the synthesis of MCFBG ﬁlters with
the LMCO algorithm and the DLP algorithm, which have
been successfully used in designing various ﬁber grating
ﬁlters,3,4) were compared and analyzed. Several MCFBGs
with the two methods and having diﬀerent grating length,
channel number and bandwidth were synthesized; their
target spectrum of the reﬂectivity can be easily set as follows

where N is the total number of channels, r0 is the maximum
reﬂectivity, c is the central wavelength, CS is channel
spacing, and  is the bandwidth for each channel. The
central wavelength is set to be 1:55 103mm (1550 nm).
The units of  and L are mm, and ðzÞ is mm1. In the
LMCO algorithm for synthesizing MCFBGs,  is an ad hoc
constant and  is a weighting parameter which is zero for
unconstrained conditions and nonzero for the constrained
coupling coeﬃcient design. The constraint on the value of
the coupling constant can be more further with the sacriﬁce
of the reﬂectivity spectrum quality by increasing the values
of the weighting parameter .
Figure 1 shows the simulation results of two-channel
MCFBG where N ¼ 2 with CS is 0.4 nm and  is 0.2 nm
in 3 dB, designed using the DLP and LMCO methods. The
results show the apodization proﬁle (n) of the LMCO
method as being more symmetrical and less complicated
than that with the DLP method. In the following design
example, a four-channel MCFBG, N ¼ 4, with grating
length 50mm, CS 0.5 nm and  0.4 nm in 3 dB, is
synthesized. The simulation results appear in Fig. 2. Again,
the designed reﬂection spectrum very well agrees with the
target spectrum with either LMCO or DLP method.
It is worth noticing, in the above MCFBGs synthesis with
the LMCO method, the weighting parameter  is zero for the
unconstrained design. To further decrease the maximum
value of the index modulation,  ¼ 1 107 is used to
control the maximum index modulation in the apodization
proﬁle. In Figs. 3 and 4, it can be seen that the maximum
index modulation of the designed MCFBG could be
signiﬁcantly decreased by slightly sacriﬁcing the channel
reﬂectivity.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have analyzed the simulation results of
synthesis of DWDM MCFBGs ﬁlters with DLP and LMCO
methods. When compared to the existing results from the
powerful DLP method, except for the slightly longer
computation time, a number of advantages in using the
LMCO approach to solve the inverse design problems of
MCFBGs have been identiﬁed. These advantages include the
possibility of constraining the patterns of the coupling
coeﬃcient proﬁles, constraining the ﬁber grating length, and
obtaining better solutions by skillfully arranging the weight-
ing parameters regarding cost. These ﬂexible features
certainly have great merit in the design of practical ﬁber
grating devices with special requirements.

UBLPG devices will be very useful in a variety of applica-
tions for an ultrawideband optical communications to cover
the S+–L bands.
2 LMO Algorithm for UBLPG
LPGs incorporate coupling guided through the core mode
into the forward propagating modes in a fiber by phase
matching the two modes at resonant wavelengths. LPGs
characteristics can be effectively identified using the
coupled mode equations.13 As the single resonance peak of
the designed UBLPG is extended over an extremely wide
wavelength range, the material dispersion should be consid-
ered in the simulation processes. The dispersive character-
istics of pure silica SiO2 and silica doped with dopants
such as GeO2 have been precisely calculated using the fol-
lowing Sellmeier equation:
n2 − 1 = 
i=1

2 , 1
where Ai and Bi are Sellmeier coefficients and  is the
wavelength, measured in microns. The silica doped with
GeO2 used in this designed case is shown in Table 1.14 The
effective index of the guided core mode can thus be ob-
tained using dispersion relations.13 The effective indices of
cladding modes can be determined by solving the disper-
sion relations of three-layer optical fibers.6 Once the effec-
tive core and cladding modes are calculated, the resonant
wavelengths of the LPGs can be expressed as p

−neff−cl
m  ·, where neff−co and neff−clm are the effective indices
of the core and the m-order cladding modes and  is the
grating period of UBLPG. The detailed theoretical analysis
of LMO for synthesized LPGs has been described in a pre-
vious work,11 in which the boundary conditions for the
coupled equations of the Lagrange multipliers were ob-
tained by using the variational method with the cost func-
tional with respect to the parameters of the designed LPG.
In the current study, to improve the target performance, the
corresponding boundary conditions for Lagrange multipli-
ers coupled equations at L are strategically calculated in
decibel scale, as follows:
coL = − 2 · AcoL · t−dB , 2a
clL = 0, 2b
where coL and clL are the Lagrange multipliers fields
for the core and cladding mode of UBLPG at L, L is the
grating length, AcoL is the mode field of the core mode of
the designed UBLPG at L, and t−dB= 10 log10Tco

Abstract: This paper demonstrated an optimal, high extinction 
ratio, spectrally flat and broadband fiber polarizer which is 
based on a birefringent elliptical-cored long-period fiber 
grating (ECLPG) with optimally synthesized by the Lagrange 
multiplier optimization (LMO) algorithm. 
Keywords: Fiber polarizer, Long-Period Fiber Grating (LPG), 
Lagrange multiplier optimization (LMO), Polarization 
extinction ratio (PER). 
1. INTRODUCTION 
An in-line fiber polarizer with the optical loss less than 1 dB, 
the polarization extinction ratio (PER) higher than 30 dB and 
even the wide operation bandwidth is beneficial for practical 
applications in fiber-optic systems. However, it is difficult to 
simultaneously satisfy the above requirements based on the 
conventional fiber polarizers [1-5]. Among them, a LPG 
based photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is not very practical for the 
difficult and expensive fabrication [1-2]. S. Ramachandran et 
al. demonstrated a broadband, spectrally flat LPG-based 
polarizer in especially designed few-mode birefringent fibers 
that were designed to have two coupled modes with identical 
group velocities in the desired spectral range of wavelength. 
The LPG coupling in this condition can achieve a broadband 
mode conversion because it occurs in the turn-around-point 
(TAP) between the fundamental mode and a specific 
higher-order guided core mode [5]. However, the special 
dispersion-tailor fiber must be difficultly fabricated using a 
specially designed process.  
This paper presents a spectral flat-top, ultra broadband 
fiber polarizer with a bandwidth of more than 80nm at -20dB. 
The proposed device is based on an elliptical-core LPG with 
synthesizing using the Lagrange multiplier optimization 
(LMO) algorithm. The current study examines the waveguide 
dispersion as well as material dispersion, calculated using the 
Sellmeier equation, involved in the numerical analysis for a 
wideband wavelength range. From the simulation results, the 
bandwidth of the resonant peak for the designed LPG can be 
substantially broadened when using the proposed LMO 
algorithm, which is a variation-based approach that has been 
proven to be very effective in designing different fiber grating  
 
filters for the applications of fiber optics [6-7].  
2. LMO ALGORITHM FOR BROARDBAND ELLIPTICAL CORE 
LPG (ECLPG) 
The dispersive characteristics of pure silica (SiO2) and silica 
doped with dopants such as GeO2 have been precisely 
calculated using the Sellmeier equation. The effective index 
of the polarized guided core modes of the ECF can thus be 
obtained using characteristic equations of published paper

Abstract: By exposing UV light on amplitude mask over a 
hollow core fiber (HCF) filled with NOA65 polymer, a novel 
and simple long-period fiber grating (LPG) with broadband 
spectral transmission is easily fabricated and demonstrated. 
 
Keywords: Polymer, Long-Period Fiber Grating (LPG), 
Hollow core fiber (HCF). 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Long-period fiber gratings (LPGs), coupled with a guided 
core mode in co-propagating modes in optical fibers, have 
been widely used as useful devices for applications in fiber 
communication and sensing systems. There are many hollow 
core fiber (HCF) based LPG filled with liquid crystal (LC) 
which have been reported in the published papers [1-4]. Y. 
Jeong et al. first proposed an electrically controllable LPG 
based on liquid crystal in a HCF [1-2]. Recently, photonic 
bandgap fiber (PBF) based LPGs were reported by using 
electrical and mechanical control [3-4]. However, the 
fabrications of such devices are expensive and complicate 
because of experimental processes for the periodically poled 
LC by a comb-structured electrode must be made by vacuum 
evaporation.   
The current paper presents a simple and novel polymer- 
hollow core long-period fiber grating (HCLPG) with 
broadband spectral transmission performance. The novel 
polymer-HCLPG device is based on a hollow core fiber filled 
with monomer NOA65. NOA65 is a kind of photo- 
polymerizable monomer which can be cured by ultraviolet 
light with a maximum absorption within the range of 
350-380nm [5]. The polymer has minimum oxygen inhibition, 
any of its surfaces in contact with air will be non-tacky when 
fully cured. In our experiment, by exposing UV light with 
certain intensity on an amplitude mask over the hollow core 
fiber filled with monomer NOA65, the monomer is 
transformed into hard and became the polymer after UV light 
curing and a LPG can be easily formed inside the hollow core 
fiber with periodical index variation. There are many merits 
of the proposed device, e.g., easy fabrication, cost effective 
(expensive equipments for UV-laser writing for traditional 
fiber gratings is not needed), all-fiber device and broadband 
spectral transmission because coupling strength (κL) is over 
coupling in the proposed LPG. To the best of authors’ 
knowledge for the first time a simple and inexpensive LPG is 
proposed. We believe such a novel device may be very useful 
in many applications.  
2. EXPERIMENT AND SIMULATION 
In experiment, monomer NOA65 was injected into a 10μm of 
diameter of hollow core fiber by high pressure micro-syringe 
pump. In our experiments, the UV exposure intensity is 30 
mW/cm2 and the curing time on amplitude mask over the 
HCF filled with monomer is about 5~30 sec at temperature 25 
°C with real time monitoring by optical spectrum analyzer 
(OSA). When monomer is gradually transformed into 
polymer in a refractive index range of 1.515(monomer with 
before UV-curing) to 1.524 (polymer with total UV-curing). A 
diagram of the proposed polymer-HCLPG is shown in Fig.1.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents the theoretical analysis for few mode 
elliptical-core fiber (ECF) with different aspect of the ellipse. 
Based on the weakly guiding approximation, the modal 
behaviors and cutoff frequencies of the proposed step-index 
elliptical-core few-mode fibers are examined and analyzed by 
solving characteristic equation which is expressed in series of 
ordinary and modified Mathieu functions. Coupling factors 
between the linearly polarized (LP) modes are also calculated 
in this present work. 
  
Introduction 
     
There are many research works have been made towards the 
guided modes in the elliptically-cored optical fibers because 
they have great applications in different technologies such as 
polarimetric sensors, dual mode filter, optical fiber 
components and so on [1-2]. The elliptical-core fiber (ECF) 
can stable mode-intensity distribution and eliminate the 
polarization-mode dispersion, therefore they can be used for 
telecommunication applications. While ECF finds such more 
interests in optical devices and fiber components, 
understanding of the guided modes and their propagation 
becomes very important. Furthermore, there is now an 
practical application in making optical components and 
sensing systems using some special properties of few mode 
fiber [3-4]. The study and realization of electromagnetic fields 
of the LP modes in special elliptical core fibers is extremely 
important and useful.  
In this study, we have theoretical analysis for elliptical-core 
fiber (ECF) with different aspect ratio of the ellipse. The modal 
behaviors and cutoff frequencies of linearly polarized (LP) 
LPmn hybrid modes in the proposed step-index elliptical-core 
few-mode fibers are examined and analyzed. By using the 
weakly guiding approximation, simulation of LPmn Modes 
characteristic equation expressed in series of ordinary and 
modified Mathieu functions can be calculated numerically. 
Coupling factors between different LP modes are also 
calculated and discussed in this present work.

Abstract - A spectral flat-top, single resonant and ultra 
broadband—more than 180 nm in a -20dB bandwidth, 
thin-clad long-period fiber grating (LPG) with 
synthesizing using the Lagrange multiplier optimization 
(LMO) algorithm is presented in this paper.  
Introduction 
A typical LPG gain flattening device could lead to a high 
insertion loss as a result of the high order cladding 
modes coupling for a wide wavelength range. To 
overcome this shortcoming, K. Oh et al. theoretically 
presented a new LPG filter that significantly enhanced 
the free spectral range (FSR) by controlling the 
waveguide dispersion of the cladding modes in fluorine-
doped-cladding LPG [1]. However, the proposed 
methods are not very practical due to the highly difficult 
fabrications of such special fibers. S. Yin et al. 
demonstrated that a HF-etched ultrathin LPG (with a 
cladding thickness of 28 μm) with first-order cladding 
mode coupling provides a wide tuning range of 120 nm 
and has only a single resonant peak over a wide 
wavelength range [2]. They presented a highly 
sensitivity sensor based on a ultra thin-clad LPG, with 
high order mode coupling that can be tuned for more 
than 220 nm; however, the inherent bandwidth of the 
resonance peaks of LPGs are narrow, at about several 
nm, because the phase-matching condition between the 
two optical modes is satisfied at only a specific resonant 
wavelength.  Indeed, this is the major drawback of the 
bandwidth-versus-coupling strength trade-offs for 
practical applications when using such a narrow-band 
LPG device. 
To enhance LPGs’ performance for broadband 
resonance of LPG filters, S. Ramachandran et al. 
demonstrated a broadband, spectrally flat LPG-based 
devices in especially designed few-mode fibers that were 
designed to have two coupled modes with identical 
group velocities, under the turn-around-point (TAP) 
condition in the desired spectral range of wavelength [3]. 
However, the special dispersion-tailor fiber must be 
difficultly fabricated using a specially designed process.  
This paper presents another option: a spectral flat-top, 
single resonant and ultra broadband LPG with a 
bandwidth of more than 180nm at -20dB. The proposed 
device is based on a thin-cladding LPG with 
synthesizing using the Lagrange multiplier optimization 
(LMO) algorithm. Such devices can be utilized as 
broadband mode converters and broadband couplers for 
broadband optical applications. They can also be used as 
a broadband all-fiber polarizer when the UBLPG is 
written in the birefringent fiber. The current study 
examines the waveguide dispersion as well as material 
dispersion, calculated using the Sellmeier equation, 
involved in the numerical analysis for covering such a 
wideband wavelength range. From the simulation results, 
the bandwidth of the resonant peak for the designed LPG 
can be substantially broadened when using the proposed 
LMO algorithm, which is a variation-based approach 
that has been proven to be very effective in designing 
different fiber gratings for the applications of fiber optics 
[4]. Furthermore, the presented UBLPG device has only 
a single resonant peak over a very wide wavelength 
range (>600nm). We believe that such UBLPG devices 
will be very useful for an ultra wideband optical 
communications to cover the S+ ~L bands.  
LMO algorithm for UBLPG 
As the single resonance peak of the designed UBLPG is 
extended over an wide wavelength range, the material 
dispersion should be considered in the simulation 
processes. The dispersive characteristics of SiO2 and 
silica doped with dopants such as GeO2 have been 
precisely calculated using the Sellmeier equations. The 
effective indices of cladding modes can be determined 
by solving the dispersion relations of three-layer optical 
fibers [2]. Once the effective core and cladding modes 
are calculated, the resonant wavelengths of the 
UBLPGs can be expressed as  , 
where  and  are the effective indices of 
the core and the
−= −coeffmp n(λ Λ⋅− )m cleffn
coeffn − m cleffn −
orderm − cladding modes and Λ is the 
grating period of UBLPG. The detailed theoretical 
analysis of LMO for synthesized LPGs has been 
described in previous work [4], in which the boundary 
conditions for the coupled equations of the Lagrange 
multipliers were obtained by using the variational 
method with the cost functional with respect to the 
parameters of the designed LPG. In the current study,

Abstract  
Optimization correction of spectral distortion for 
superimposed DWDM multichannel fiber Bragg grating 
filters is performed with a hybrid Lagrange multiplier 
optimization algorithm to enable fast convergence as 
well as to retain the easy-fabrication merits. 
 
Introduction 
Multichannel fiber Bragg grating (FBGs) are essential 
optical devices in modern optical communication 
systems and fiber sensor applications. Their narrow 
bandwidth properties facilitate wavelength filtering in 
dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) 
systems. To fabricate limited-length multichannel FBGs 
within photosensitive fibers, the most simplistic 
approach is to sequentially superimpose several single-
channel FBGs with their location slightly shifted. 
Another widely used method is the sampling grating 
method[1]. However, these types of FBGs will suffer 
from the spectral response distortion due to spatial and 
spectral overlap or the existing interchannel interference. 
Recently, the fast and efficient discrete layer-peeling 
(DLP) algorithm has been developed for inversely 
designing general FBGs. However, for designing 
multichannel FBGs[2], the designed results from DLP 
would easily exceed the maximum index change of the 
practical fiber photosensitivity. Therefore some 
optimization-based approaches have been developed to 
constrain the maximum index change during the design 
procedure[3-5]. Even so, the designed envelopes of the 
index change for mutichannel FBGs are typically 
complicated with many sharp index changes, which 
enhance the difficulties in production. The required 
iteration to achieve the optimized results from the initial 
guessed index profile for stochastic optimization 
calculation may take long time as well. 
In principle, if neglecting the spectral distortion, the 
most simplistic superimpose method is relatively 
attractive, particularly when the advanced high index 
change photosensitive fibers have still been developing 
nowadays. In the present letter, we investigate a new 
optimization correction method for spectral distortion of 
multichannel FBG design based on the superimpose 
method. The approach starts from some other 
multichannel FBGs design methods suffering from the 
spectral distortion, and then employs the Lagrange 
multiplier optimization (LMO) algorithm[5] to correct 
these distortions. We have selected the designed 
examples of superimposed FBGs for the first step, just 
for the reason of being the most simplistic way for 
fabrication. By utilizing this developed hybrid algorithm, 
our approach can fast and efficiently converge to the 
optimization target starting from the close initial profile 
and still retains the easy-fabrication feature.

The LMO algorithm embarks on the following objective 
functional that needs to be minimized [5]:

The design goal is to minimize the difference of )(λγ

till it converges to zero. In order to simulate different 
periods of gratings superimposed with each other, the 
period shift from

superimposed fabrication method, the total length L

consider three different periods of gratings superimposed 
to form the total length L. Then it should be divided into 
five sections: 0~L1, L1~L2, L2~L3, L3~L4, L4~L. The
