Abstract 
The synthesis and characteristic absorption spectra of 
2,3,8-trisubstituted-indeno [2,1-b]thiophene compounds 5, 6 
and 7 were reported. Cyclization of 3-dicyanovinyl- indan-1- 
one 3 with sulfur gave 2-amino-8-oxo-8H-indeno[2,1-b]thio- 
phene-3-carbo- nitrile compound 5. The reaction of compound 
5 with malononitrile and with ethyl cyanoacetate gave the 
indeno[2,1-b]thiophene derivatives 6 and 7, respectively. The 
absorption maxima of these compounds changed very 
significantly by the introduction of various substituents on the 
8-position of indeno[2,1-b]thiophene ring system. The 
preparations of the corresponding azomethine dyes and azo 
disperse dyes were also reported. The azomethine dyes 10, 11 
and 12 were carried out by condensation reaction of 
compounds 5, 6 and 7 with N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde 8. 
Additionally, compounds 5, 6 and 7, as diazo components, were 
diazotized using sodium nitrite in concentrated sulfuric acid, 
and coupled to N,N-disubstituted anilines 9a-d to afford a 
series of novel azo disperse dyes 13a-d, 14a-d and 15a-d, 
respectively.  The prepared products were confirmed by 
elemental analysis, IR, 1H-NMR and MS spectral data. The 
substituent effects of these compounds and dyes on the 
electronic absorption properties in solvent are also evaluated.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, the use of heterocyclic intermediates in the 
synthesis of azo disperse dyes is well established, and the 
resultant dyes exhibit good tinctorial strength and brighter 
dyeing than those aniline-based components [1-6]. Dyes 
derivative from heterocyclic amine produce a pronounced 
bathochromic shift when compared to the corresponding 
benzoid compounds [7-9]. It is well known that some simple 
2-aminothiophene and its benzo analogues are very useful 
compounds as intermediates in the dyestuff industry and find 
widely application in pharmaceutical [10-20] and electronic 
industry [21-22]. Thiophene-based azo dyes show generally red 
to blue in colour with high extinction coefficient in comparison 
with aniline-based azo dyes. To our knowledge, there are few 
papers dealing with the carbocyclic fused thiophene 
compounds as dye intermediates. And the preparation of the 
corresponding azo or azomethine dyes derived from these 
compounds are not present so far. In the present investigation, 
we report here the synthesis of some new trisubstituted 
indeno[2,1-b]thiophene compounds 5, 6 and 7 derived from 
3-dicyanovinylindan-1-one 3, as starting material.  As a part 
of our investigation focused on the synthetic ultility of new 
prepared heterocyclic compounds as dye intermediates for dyes.  
The synthesis of dyes with different chromophore types, such 
as azomethine dyes 10, 11 and 12 and azo disperse dyes 13, 14 
and 15, respectively, were reported in this paper. Also, the 
substituent effects of these dyes on their absorption properties 
were evaluated. 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Synthesis of intermediate compounds 5, 6 and 7 
The reaction routes for the synthesis of 2,3,8-trisubstituted 
indeno[2,1-b]thiopnene derivatives 5, 6 and 7 were described, 
as shown in scheme 1. Condensation of 1,3-indandione 1 with 
malononitrile 2 gave the 3-dicyanvinylindan-1-one 3 in good 
yield. Compound 5 was prepared by ring closure of compound 
3 with sulfur in the presence of diethylamine as catalyst in 
absolute ethanol. This process was achieved in high yield 
(92%). The obtained product was characterized using IR, MS 
and 1H-NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum of product 5 
showed a characteristic band at 2219 cm–1, attributed to the 
cyano group, and a strong band at 1664 cm–1 was assigned to 
the carbonyl group. The characteristic band for the amino group 
appeared in the range of 3175-3299 cm–1. The mass spectrum 
of this product revealed a molecular ion peak (M/z) at 226. The 
1H-NMR spectrum of compound 5 was recorded in DMSO-d6. 
Compound 5 showed a 2H singlet at δ= 8.76 ppm assigned to 
the protons of amino group, and a 4H multiplet at δ= 
7.25-7.41 ppm is attributed to aromatic protons in the ring of 
indeno[2,1-b]thiophene. The structure of this product was 
actually identified as 2-amino-8-oxo-8H-indeno[2,1-b]thio- 
phene-3-carbonitrile. 
Compound 5 reacted with an excess of malononitrile 2 in 
absolute ethanol in the presence of anhydrous sodium acetate 
under reflux to afford the compound 6 in excellent yield (95%). 
The spectrum of compound 6 showed the absorption bands at

The preparations of azo disperse dyes 14 and 15 are 
similar to those for the dyes 13, except the diazo components 
replaced by other aminoindeno[2,1-b]thiophene derivatives 6 
and 7. The colour of the dyes 14 and 15 are deep blue-greenish. 
The structures of azo disperse dyes 13, 14 and 15 were 
established by elemental analysis and spectral data, as shown in 
Tables 1 and 2. The IR spectrum of the dyes 13, 14 and 15 
showed the absorption band in the range from 2213 to 2221 
cm–1 due to the presence of cyano group. It was observed that 
the carbonyl absorption appeared in the range from 1698 to 
1713 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of dyes 13 and 15 except that of 
the dye 14. The absorption band of amino group was not 
present in the IR spectrum of dyes 13, 14 and 15. The 1H-NMR 
spectra of azo dyes were recorded in DMSO-d6. Azo dyes 13, 
14 and 15 showed a 8H multiplet in the range from δ= 
6.65-7.06 to 7.99-8.34 ppm, which can be attributed to the 
protons of the two aromatic groups, one (4H) on the 
indeno[2,1-b]thiophene moiety and the other (4H) on the 
aniline ring. The signal of amino group was not observed in the 
1H-NMR spectrum of azo dyes. 
The physical and spectral data of the azomethine dyes 10, 
11 and 12 and azo disperse dyes 13a-d, 14a-d and 15a-d are 
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. 
Analytical and spectral data support fully the structure for 
all dyes.

are taken as the parent molecules. The shifts observed for 
the azo dyes 13a, 14a and 15a can be attributed to the effect of 
nitrogen atom with lone pair electron. 
The substituent effects at the 8-position of 
indeno[2,1-b]thiophene diazo component of azo dyes, are listed 
in Table 5. The absorption maxima of dyes 13a, 14a and 15a 
showed the absorption bands in the visible regions at 561, 691 
and 658 nm, respectively. Replacement of carbonyl group in 
the indeno[2,1-b]thiophene moiety by a dicyanovinyl group or 
cyano carbethoxyvinyl group shift the absorption maximum to 
longer wavelengths. Dye 14a showed a significantly higher Δ
λ = 130 nm than dye 13a. Dye 15a containing cyano 
carbethoxy group absorbed also at 97 nm higher than dye 13a. 
Introduction of strong electron-withdrawing substituents into 
the diazo component results in a large bathochromic shift.
