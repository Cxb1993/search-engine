The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates a multi-period portfolio selection problem. 
The GA for solving the proposed problem is stated in Section 3. Section 4 presents the experiments to show the 
solution of a multi-period portfolio selection of Taiwanese stocks by the proposed GA. Finally, Section 5 concludes 
the paper and suggests possible future research directions. 
2 A formulation for a multi-period portfolio selection problem 
In this paper, we assume an investor buy initial shares of the assets at time t = 0 with the budget b. The rebalancing 
takes place instantaneously at discrete time t = 1, 2, ..., T. The investor can allocate his wealth among the N assets. 
si,t denotes the expected price of the ith asset at time t. ui,t denotes the number of shares of the ith asset traded at time 
t for rebalancing. Therefore, the vector x’ = [u1,0, ..., u1,T, u2,0, ..., u2,T, ..., un,0, ..., un,T] denotes the investor’s trading 
strategy and the vector r’ = [r1,0, ..., r1,T, r2,0, ..., r2,T, rn,0, ..., rn,T] = [(s1,T+1−s1,0), ..., (s1,T+1−s1,T), (s2,T+1−s2,0), ..., 
(s2,T+1−s2,T), ..., (sn,T+1−sn,0), ..., (sn,T+1−sn,T)] denotes the vector of the investor’s expected return. The matrix Σ is the 
general covariance matrix [please refer to (Draviam and Chellathurai, 2002) for detail], contains the block matrices 
Ci,j as elements and has T×N rows and columns as shown (1).

where Ci,j(p,q) is the (p, q)th element of an N×N covariance matrix Ci,j define by  
Ci,j(p,q) =E{(Rp,i-rp,i)(Rq,j-rq,j)}, where Rp,i is the random variable of return of the pth asset at time i and Rq,j is the 
random variable of return of the qth asset at time j. 
In terms of the Markowitz mean-variance principle, the multi-period portfolio selection problem is formulated 
in the following: 
(Problem) min σp2 = x’Σx / b2 (2)

new chromosome. The most commonly used is single-point crossover. Another alternative is chromosome mixing, 
where intact chromosomes are randomly swapped. As a random algorithm, it also has parameters to be set, i.e., 
mutation rate, crossover rate, etc. No general agreement in the community about which is the preferred variation 
exists; the choice depends on the particular task (Adcock, 2010). 
3.1 Encoding 
As describe above, encoding a solution into a chromosome is an important issue in using GAs. A solutions to the 
proposed problem is the vector x, which contains the number of shares of all assets traded at all trading date. We 
uses real numbers to encode the solutions and the length of the chromosome is N×T. However, not all elements of 
the vector x is free to change. Since constraints (3), (4) and (5) contains T+2 simultaneous equations, T+2 elements 
of the vector x should be solved. We choose u1,0, u2,0, u1,t (where t = 1, ..., T) to be solved and others to be 
random-generated for each chromosome of the first generation. 
3.2 Fitness Function 
Although solving simultaneous equations can satisfy constraints (3), (4) and (5) in the first generation, the mutation 
operator may break them in the follow-up generations. To deal with the situation, we use the penalty strategy that 
integrates a penalty function into a fitness function to direct the infeasible solutions evolve into feasible ones. The 
penalty functions are defined as follows.

The fitness function integrates the objective function of minimizing σp2 and penalty functions as follows. 
Fitness =1/{σp2 + Z[e(u)+f(u)+g(u) +h(u)]}, 
where Z is a very large positive number to make penalties effective. The inverse form transforms the 
minimization problem into an equivalent maximization problem.  
4 Empirical Results 
4.1 Data for Testing Problem 
We use monthly data of Taiwanese stock from October, 2009 to April, 2010 to test the proposed algorithm. The 
monthly closed prices are list in table 1. We conduct two experiments with T=0 (i.e. single period) and T=3 (i.e. 
multi-period), respectively. For T=0, an analytical closed form solution for general problems exists and we compare

4.2 Parameter Setting for GA 
We use Genetic Algorithm Utility Library (GAUL) (Adcock, 2010) to implement the algorithm and many 
parameters should be set before running. The number of population is set to 100. The number of generation is set to 
100000. Single selection method is set to ‘round robin’. The mutation rate is set to 0.9 to generate most diverse 
solutions in each single generation. The best parent of the population is not replaced by children to keep the best 
solution alive. The crossover operator is not used. For T=0, the value of the required return rate µ of the testing 
problem ranges from 0.0005 to 0.0950. For T=3, the value of the required return rate µ of the testing problem ranges 
from -0.005 to 0.0045. The algorithm runs once for every value of µ (increasing 0.0005 per run), the corresponding 
variance of the best portfolio is calculated, and then the equation of the efficient frontier is fitted by cftool of 
MATLAB. The original budget b is set to 1 million. 
4.3 Efficient Frontiers 
The closed-form solution [refer to Rabbani (2010) for detail] for T=0 is shown in (7). Figure 1 shows the numerical 
data generated by our algorithm and (8) shows the equation fitted from the numerical data. The points in Figure 1 
are the best portfolios generated by our algorithm, dotted line is the curve fitted by MATLAB, and the solid line is 
drawn according to the closed-form solution. We can find that (7) and (8) are almost identical. Therefore, we can say 
safely that the algorithm can generate efficient frontiers as good as the analytical method for single period portfolio 
selection problem. 
For T=3, there are no closed-form solutions for general problems. However, our algorithm can also generate the 
numerical solution. The numerical data is shown in Figure 2 and the equation fit from the numerical data is shown in 
(9).
