evaporation system is used deposit organic 
films and metal electrodes as shown in fig. 2. 
Before the device fabrication, the ITO glass 
was carefully cleaned in successive baths of 
solvents of isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and 
methanol with a ultrasonic cleaner. The 
organic films and metal anode were deposited 
via high-vacuum thermal evaporation at a 
base pressure of 5.0×10-6 Torr. For the device, 
a 250-Å-thick film of PTCDA was deposited 
onto the ITO cathode as n-type layer, 
followed by a various p-type layer. The 
various p-type layer materials, including 
ZnPc, CuPc, and m-MTDATA were deposited 
up to 550 Å, 350 Å, and 350 Å, respectively. 
Finally, a 1000-Å-thick Ag anode was 
evaporated to define the active area of 0.09 
cm2. 
The current density versus voltage (J-V) 
characteristics in the dark and under 
illumination from a solar simulator set to 
produce an AM1.5 (air mass 1.5) spectrum 
were measured using a Keithley 2400 source 
measurement unit. The illumination intensity 
was measured with a PMA2100 photometer. 
The absorption spectra were measured on 
ITO glass substrates using an HP 8453 
ultraviolet/visible spectrometer referenced to 
clean ITO glass substrates to cancel out 
absorption losses in the ITO glass. All 
measurements were carried out at room 
temperature in ambient air. 
 
四、重要結果與討論： 
Fig. 3 shows the current density versus 
voltage (J-V) characteristics of the devices 
with various p-type layer materials. Table I 
summarizes the photovoltaic performances 
for the all detected devices. Evidence 
indicates that the device with ZnPc p-type 
layer exhibits the superior power conversion 
efficiency characteristic as comparing to 
those with CuPc and m-MTDATA p-type 
layers. Such a result was deduced to be that 
ZnPc possesses the higher lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (LUMO) and the better 
absorption property. To further elucidate the 
effects of various p-type layer materials on 
the photovoltaic properties of organic solar 
cells, the energy-band diagram and the 
absorption measurements have been also 
established which were shown in Fig. 4 and 
Fig. 5, respectively. 
In this article, the effect of the active layer 
on the photovoltaic properties of organic 
p-i-n solar cell was systematically 
investigated. The device structure consisting 
of indium tin oxide (ITO) / perylene 
tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) / active 
layer (X nm) / zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) / 
Ag, was shown in Fig. 1. Inside the device, 
ZnPc and PTCDA were arranged to constitute 
the active layer with different thickness 
ranging from 0 to 10 nm. The highest power 
efficiency (0.1%) occurred at the active layer 
with a thickness of 5 nm, and decreased with 
increasing of thickness of active layer. The 
characteristic of current density－voltage (J
－V) was illustrated in Fig. 7. Besides, the 
relationship between photovoltaic properties 
and thickness of active layer was depicted in 
Fig. 8. It is evident that the short-circuit
