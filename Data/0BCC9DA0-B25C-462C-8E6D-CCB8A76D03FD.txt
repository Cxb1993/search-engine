Abstract: A least-squares (LS) channel estimation (CE) technique is investigated to apply pseudo-random-postfix
orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (PRP-OFDM) communications onto mobile applications, which often
operate on a rapidly time-varying frequency-selective fading channel. Since conventional techniques exploiting
a moving averager cannot function on a rapidly time-varying channel, the proposed technique takes
advantage of several self-interference cancellation (SIC) methods to effectively and timely reduce inter-path
interference, inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-block interference (IBI). The proposed technique can
therefore overcome frequency selectivity caused by multipath fading and time selectivity caused by mobility;
in particular, OFDM communication is often anticipated to operate in environments where both wide Doppler
spread and long delay spread exist. Meanwhile, lower mean-square estimation errors, lower error probabilities
and lower error floors can also be achieved using the proposed technique. Since conventional techniques
based on minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) CE usually highly require a priori channel information or many
training preambles, a generic estimator assisted from LS CE is exploited as it can be performed serially, block
by block, to reduce computational complexity. Extensive computer simulations in conjunction with strict
statistical analysis are carried out to verify the improvements provided by the proposed technique.
1 Introduction
Orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM)
technologies have recently been chosen as candidates for
fourth-generation (4G) mobile communications in a
variety of standards, such as IEEE 802.16 and IEEE
802.20 [1] in the United States, and international research
projects, such as EU-IST-MATRICE and EU-IST-
4MORE projects [2] for 4G mobile communication
standardisation at the European level. Although the
mobile communication applications mentioned above are
all based on cyclic-prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM)
modulation techniques, several encouraging prior
contributions have investigated other alternatives, for
example zero-padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) [3, 4] and
pseudo-random-postfix OFDM (PRP-OFDM) [5, 6] for
the purpose of substituting the time-domain (TD)
redundancy by null samples or by known/pre-determined
sequences. It has been found that many improvements and
superiorities can be accomplished by either ZP-OFDM or
PRP-OFDM over CP-OFDM [3–6]. ZP-OFDM has
been completely studied in the previous works [3, 4] for
achieving the merit of keeping symbol recovery irrespective
of null locations on a multipath channel. Meanwhile,
PRP-OFDM replaces the null samples originally inserted
between any two OFDM blocks in ZP-OFDM by an a
priori known sequence. This way, the receiver can take
care of a priori knowledge of a fraction of transmitted
blocks for accurately estimating the channel impulse
response (CIR) and for effectively reducing loss of
transmission rate on highly frequent and periodical
training sequences [5, 6].

Immediately after the IDFT modulation process, a postfix
vector c0L ¼ [c0 c1    cLÿ1]T, where the superscript ð ÞT
denotes the transpose operator, is appended to the resultant
output vector x0N [i] from the IDFT modulation. In this
study, c0L is sifted from a partial period of a long pseudo-
random sequence and c0L is phase updated every frame that
contains tens of TD OFDM signal blocks; instead, a
deterministic postfix vector with a pseudo-random weight
was employed in the conventional PRP-OFDM [5–7]. The
main reason is that no long PRP sequence was suggested in
the previous works [5–7] and that pseudo-random
sequences, for example m-sequence, gold sequence, are
actually more commonly used in various communication
applications. Therefore the ith transmitted block with a
length of M ¼ N þ L can be expressed as
xM [i] ¼ FHzpXN [i]þ cM (2)

IN denotes an N  N identity matrix, and 0LN denotes a
zero matrix with the size indicated in its subscript. The
elements of xM [i] are then transmitted sequentially one by
one (probably with transmit filtering or symbol shaping).
The channel studied here is modelled by means of a
tapped-delay-line or a finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter
of order v2 1, that is the impulse response of the
investigated channel can be written as
h ¼ h0 h1    hvÿ1

It is commonly assumed that the postfix (or prefix)
redundancy of length L is longer than the length of the
CIR v. Typically, the multipath delay spread of the
transmission channel is highly dynamic and cannot be
determined a priori at the receiving end. Therefore the
number of channel tap-weighting coefficients is often
assumed to be up to L for the purpose of taking the worst
ISI-free case into consideration. Meanwhile, the number of
channel tap-weighting coefficients is therefore assumed to
be the length of the postfix, that is v ¼ L. Thus, the
longest excess delay is vTs, where Ts denotes the sample
duration.

formulated as

2.1 Channel estimation
In this paper, the CIR is considered to be time-varying, but
not significantly changing within one or two OFDM blocks.
The symbols employed here for the sake of CE can be
formulated as follows
rCE,Lþvÿ1[i] ¼

In fact, rCE,Lþvÿ1[i] can be reformulated in detail as
follows
rCE,Lþvÿ1[i] ¼ C[i]hþ n00[i] ¼ Cohþ n0[i] (6)

a benchmark in theory; meanwhile, performance
comparisons among the proposed techniques and other
techniques in previous studies [5–7] in terms of MSE will
be given in the next section. By proceeding with the
derivations written in either (7) or (8), the received signal
to be employed in the CE can be reformulated in much
detail as

If mobile OFDM communication systems operate in
environments with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values
or if various kinds of interference can be effectively
eliminated, the effects of interference are negligible when
compared with those of the noise. Under the above
assumption, the mobile OFDM systems work in noise-
dominant environments and, thus, the autocovariance
matrix of n[i] can be considered as
Kn ¼
s2n
2
ILþvÿ1 þ K I 8
s2n
2
ILþvÿ1 (14)
where K I denotes the covariance resulting from the
interference. In accordance with the reasoning in the
previous studies [12, 13], the minimum-variance unbiased
(MVU) estimation can be accomplished in theory, and the
Cramer–Rao bound (CRB) being attained here can be
directly found by means of the partial derivative of the log-
likelihood function [11, p. 83], that is

This is mainly because the previous noise-dominant
assumption makes rCE,Lþvÿ1[i] white and Gaussian; thus,
the LS solution can be considered to be the linear-model
estimation technique [11, p. 83] and can arrive at MVU
[12, 13]. As a result, it can be learned from (15) that the
proposed CE written in (7) and (8) evidently arrive at the
MVU estimation in noise-dominant environments, and its
covariance matrix, also obtained from (15), can be written as

from the v estimation error variances of the TD channel tap-
weighting coefficients.
3.2 Error probability
The symbol-error probability and bit-error probability of
QPSK transmitted over an AWGN channel can be written
as [14, 15]

and Eb denote the symbol energy and bit energy, respectively;
and N0/2 is the two-sided PSD of the AWGN. If the
transmission system operates on a Rayleigh flat fading
channel, the symbol-error probability and bit-error
probability can be derived as [14, 15]

enough narrow bandwidth) in order to effectively suppress
various kinds of interference and reduce the AWGN on
the other hand.
In practice, this can be quantitatively discussed below. It
can be observed, from Figs. 9 and 10 in the prior article
[7], that the CE MSEs will arrive at error floors or will
arrive at their minima roughly while the moving-averagers
accumulate 20–40 OFDM symbols in the WLAN (say,
IEEE802.11a and HIPERLAN/2) environments tested,
where the carrier frequency is 5.2 GHz, the subcarrier
number is 64, the bandwidth is 20 MHz and the mobile
speed is 30 m/s. In the simulation experiment, the mobility
of 30 m/s would lead to a maximum Doppler frequency of
fD ¼ 520 Hz. Meanwhile, 20–40 OFDM symbols could
span the accumulation duration of the moving-averager
employed in the previous study [7] over 80–160 ms. Since
the coherence time of the time-varying channel tested in
the previous study [7] can be evaluated by [17, p. 166]
Tcoh: ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
9
16pf 2D
s
¼ 813:73 ms
the accumulation duration of the moving averager has to be
chosen in the range from 9.83% to 19.66% of Tcoh. to
effectively reduce the CE MSEs.
Based on the environmental parameters, as listed in
Table 1, the maximum Doppler frequency and coherence
time of the mobile channel tested in the following
simulation experiments can be evaluated as
fD ¼ 1:611 kHz (carrier frequency: 5:8GHz;
speed: 300 km/h)
Tcoh: ¼ 262:64 ms
On the mobile channel tested in the following simulation
experiments, 9.83–19.66% of Tcoh: corresponds to 25.82–
51.64 ms. As a result, the best accumulation duration of the
moving averager in the mobile environment under
investigation would be only 1.16–2.33 OFDM symbol
periods if the OFDM symbol duration is determined to be a
period of 22.2 ms according to Table 1. Even if the relative
velocity is reduced to 100 km/h, the corresponding best
accumulation duration may be updated to roughly 3.48–7.00
OFDM symbol durations. In theory, the CLT cannot be
applied to the sums of such few random variables, as
previously mentioned. The ability to suppress the interferences
by averaging over the above-mentioned OFDM symbol
durations (7) is, in practice, very limited. Based on the above
reasoning, the CE techniques assisted from moving-
averaging-based ISI/IBI suppression methods in the previous
studies [5–7] cannot function in the mobile environments.
Since the OFDM symbol duration (say, 22.2 ms in this
experiment) is very often chosen to be much shorter than
the coherence time (i.e. roughly, 262.64 ms in this
experiment) of the mobile channel in order to keep the
primary assumption that the channel can be considered static
or very slowly time varying within an OFDM symbol
duration, the channel transfer function (CTF) or the CIR to
be estimated in an OFDM symbol duration is highly
correlated with that obtained in neighbouring (i.e. preceding
or succeeding) OFDM symbol durations. Therefore the
CTF or the CIR can very often be obtained using
smoothing, filtering or interpolation methods in the time
direction. Several TD smoothing methods have been
intuitively proposed and thoroughly investigated by
modelling channel tap-weighting coefficients as auto-
regressive (AR) processes in the previous studies [7, 8, 12,
13]. It has been proven in the prior articles [8, 12, 13] that
the LI method based on first-order statistics can achieve a
lower estimation error than the second-order polynomial
interpolation method can. It may be surprising that second-
or higher-order interpolation methods cannot achieve lower
errors in the TD smoothing process on CIR estimation.
This is mainly because second-order or even higher-order
smoothing/filtering/extrapolation methods undesirably
introduce a group delay into the estimates of CIR [12, 13,
18, p. 60]. This group delay will randomly rotate the FD
channel weights on individual subchannels, thus destroying
the subsequent CE and equalisation. As a result, the
proposed technique also employs the TD LI method for
accurate CIR estimation as employed in the prior study [8].

respectively. Shown in Figs. 2a and 3a are MSE sums over

4.3 BER comparison
Illustrated in Figs. 4–6 are bit error probabilities against
time-average Eb=N0 obtained using the previous works [5–
7] and the proposed technique in the 4MORE RA
environment when a maximum mobile speed of either 30,
100 or 300 km/h exists, respectively. It can be seen from
these figures that the OLA with SIC symbol recovery
equalised by the ZF and MMSE CEs studied in the
previous works [5–7] can work only on a very slowly time-
varying channel, for example with a mobility of 30 km/h;
and that they have high error probabilities when a mobile
speed is either 100 or 300 km/h. When the previous works
[5–7] are performed on a very slowly time-varying
multipath channel (as is shown in Fig. 4), the longer the
accumulation duration is, the lower the error probabilities
achieved in the previous works [5–7]. This is mainly
because a longer accumulation duration of the moving
averagers employed in the previous works [5–7] can reduce
various kinds of interference more effectively by their
narrower-bandwidth filtering. On the other hand, while the
previous works [5–7] are performed in higher-mobility
environments (as employed in Fig. 6), the longer the
accumulation duration is, the higher the error probabilities
achieved in the previous works [5–7] were. Although
longer accumulation durations of the moving averagers
employed in the previous works [5–7] can reduce
interference more effectively, such narrow bandwidths of
the moving averagers completely change the statistics of the
PRP and the local means of the channel. They inevitably
result in CE performance degradation and, thus, higher
error probabilities. However, the proposed technique,
labelled with either ‘RSD,2,0,N ; h^
0
0’ or ‘RSD,2,1,N ; h^
0
1’ in
these figures, can achieve lower error probabilities by taking
advantage of the proposed SIC methods than the previous
works [5–7], which are compared here. ‘RSD,1,N ; h^
0
0’ has
high error probabilities because the conventional OLA with
no SIC inevitably introduces self-interference. Furthermore,
‘RSD,2,1,N ; h^
0
1’ and ‘RSD,2,0,N ; h^
0
0’ can achieve lower error
probabilities (or lower error floors) than ‘RSD,0,N ; h^
0
0’ can
in interference-dominant environments because the DD
SIC method can function well only on high-SNR
conditions. This is the main reason that the crossovers
occur with the SER (or BER) curves of ‘RSD,2,1,N ; h^
0
1 ’ and
‘RSD,0,N ; h^
0
0’ in these figures.

technique can effectively deal with the problem caused by a
residual timing error.
Illustrated in Fig. 8 are the BERs obtained using the
compared techniques tested in environments identical to
those employed in Fig. 5, except the uniformly distributed
residual timing error d  Uniform (0, L/32] that exists in
this experiment. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the bit
error probabilities obtained here using the proposed
technique are close to those shown in Fig. 5 using the
perfect timing synchronisation assumption. This indicates
that the proposed technique has a high tolerance to timing
errors that occur in the DFT demodulation.
5 Conclusion
The proposed LS CE technique has been thoroughly
investigated in practical mobile environments. By taking
advantage of the SIC mechanisms, the proposed technique
can timely eliminate various interferences, accurately
estimate CIR, effectively track rapid CIR variations and
therefore can achieve low error probabilities. The proposed
technique can achieve low bit error floors as 1/5 of those
obtained using the conventional method. The generic
estimator assisted from the LS CE can be performed
sequentially on all OFDM blocks for complexity reduction
without a priori channel information, which was actually
required by the conventional techniques based on MMSE.
Using the generic estimator, the computational complexity
can be reduced to be roughly 1/14 of the conventional
method. In addition, the proposed technique exhibits better
robustness against some residual timing error that occurs
with the DFT demodulation than the previous studies
compared here. The improvements of the proposed
techniques have been verified by means of extensive
computer simulations in conjunction with statistical analysis.

Abstract: A channel estimation (CE) technique that uses a postfixed pseudo-random sequence padded with
zero samples is investigated to extend pseudo-random-postfix orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing
(PRP-OFDM) communications onto mobile applications. The proposed technique takes advantage of
pseudo-noise sequences periodically inserted after each OFDM block within the original guard interval
(GI) in conventional zero-padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) or within the original cyclic prefix (CP) in conventional
CP-OFDM. This allows accurate estimation of the channel impulse response. In addition, the proposed
technique takes advantage of the null samples padded after the PN sequences for reducing inter-symbol
interference occurring with the CEs and with the overlap-add information detection in the conventional
PRP-OFDM. The proposed technique successfully applies either (1) a least-squares (LS) CE with assistance
from decision-directed data or (2) an approximate LS CE method onto PRP-OFDM-like communications for
the purpose of improving CE performance on rapid time-varying channels. Computer simulations in
conjunction with statistical analysis assess the performance evaluation of the proposed technique and
show that it can achieve lower mean-square estimation errors and lower error probabilities in mobile
environments.
1 Introduction
Next-generation mobile communications are anticipated to
fulfill various multimedia services, from high-quality voice to
video applications transmitted over wireless channels.
Therefore broadband multi-carrier transmission technologies,
e.g. orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM),
have recently attracted a lot of research interest. Various
applications have successfully exploited OFDM technologies.
Examples of these applications include European digital
audio broadcasting (DAB) [1], digital video broadcasting
systems (DVB) [2], high-speed modems on digital subscriber
line (xDSL) applications [3], wireless local area network
(WLAN) [4], Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
Access (WiMAX, IEEE 802.16e) [5, 6] and 3GPP LTE
[7]. Although all these OFDM applications employed the
CP-OFDM, encouraging previous studies have considered
zero-padded (ZP)-OFDM and pseudo-random-postfix
(PRP)-OFDM and have found several superiorities/
improvements that can potentially be achieved [8, 9]. ZP-
OFDM was thoroughly investigated in the previous study for
being capable of guaranteeing symbol recovery irrespective of
null locations on multipath channels [8]. Meanwhile, PRP-
OFDM substitutes null samples originally inserted between
any two OFDM blocks in ZP-OFDM by an a priori known
sequence [9]. This way, the receiver can exploit a priori
knowledge of a fraction of transmitted blocks for the purpose
of accurately estimating the channel impulse response (CIR)

advantage of a PN sequence with length D padded with
Dþ 2 null samples to keep system consistency and
comparison fairness.
Very often, the channel model can be expressed as [16, 17]
h(t, t) ¼
XLcÿ1
i¼0
ai(t)d(tÿ iTs) (3)
where Lc denotes the number of taps, Ts is the sample
duration, ai(t) represents the ith tap-weighting coefficient
of the channel, t and t are the time and delay parameters,
respectively. In practice, OFDM communication systems
are commonly arranged such that the entire postfix (or
prefix) (i.e. the GI in ZP-OFDM, the CP duration in CP-
OFDM, the PRP length in PRP-OFDM and the PRP
plus padded zeros, L ¼ 2D þ 2, in the proposed technique)
exceeds the channel memory; i.e. Lc  L. It is remarked
that if Lc . D, the proposed technique may fail to
function, and that if Lc . 2D þ 2, ISI may occur with any
forms of OFDM systems and destroy conventional CEs.
Because the worst case was considered in the previous
studies [12–14], the length of CIR was assumed to be
Lc ¼ L. However, based on the reasoning in a previous
study [18, 19], the length of CIR Lc set to be D is
sufficiently conservative. In practice, D is actually much
longer than the length of the CIR. Therefore the received
signal can be expressed as
r(t) ¼ r0(t)þ w(t) ¼
XLcÿ1
i¼0
ais(t ÿ iTs)þ w(t) (4)
where w(t) is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
Although ai is definitely time-varying, (t) was omitted for
simplicity. At the receiving end, the received signal is
sampled to generate the OFDM symbol block [rm,0
rm,1    rm,Nÿ1 ym,0 ym,1    ym,Lÿ1]T. The last L samples of
the received OFDM symbol block are exploited for CE,
and they can be formulated in detail as

where wm,n denotes the AWGN samples. Meanwhile,
rm,n, n ¼ 0, 1, . . . ,N ÿ 1 are fed into the overlap-add

[8, 9, 12–14] to generate the samples r0m,n, n ¼ 0, 1, . . . ,

Eventually, the LS CE assisted by the DD data and preceding
CE proposed here can be formulated as

m¼ 1, 2, . . .
(13)
where Y^LS=DDm ¼ Ymÿ C^mH^LS=DDmÿ1 represents the PRP
portion of the mth received OFDM symbol with the IBI
cancellation.
3.2 Approximate LS CE
Equation (8) can be reformulated as follows:
Ym ¼ CmHm þ Nm ¼ CHm þ N 0m (14)
where N 0m ¼ Nm þ C0mHm. The LS solution of (14) can be
expressed as
H^
ALS
m ¼ ( C
H
C)ÿ1 C
H
Ym, m ¼ 0, 1, . . . (15)
Because all of IBI terms are summed into N0, (15) can
definitely be considered an LS CE because it completely
obeys the LS philosophy [21]. H^ALSm is, in fact, an
approximate version of H^LS=DDm . It achieves significant
reduction in computational complexity with very slight CE
performance degradation. Although the term
{( C
H
C)ÿ1 C
H
} either in (13) or (15) can be pre-calculated
and pre-stored for every OFDM frame as a generic CIR
estimator and it can be sequentially applied onto each
OFDM symbol in the same OFDM frame, Y^LS=DDm in (13)
must be evaluated for every OFDM symbol because the
IBI regeneration and cancellation must be updated for
every OFDM symbol.
4 Symbol recovery and
self-interference cancellation
To accurately detect information, self-interference
cancellation and symbol recovery have to be conducted
immediately before signal detection processes. To conduct
the symbol recovery process, the last L samples have to be
overlapped and added to the leading L samples. The
overlap-add (OLA) method was employed in the previous
study [13]. The pre-demodulation symbols after the OLA
can thus be written as
r0m,0

r0m,2

(16)
The OLA method can reduce ICI caused by multipath
fading and timing error by keeping the orthogonality
among subcarriers in the same fashion as in the CP-
OFDM. However, extra IBI, contained in
[ym,0 ym,1    ym,Lÿ1 0    0]T, is inevitably introduced by the
above-mentioned OLA process, and therefore it must be
removed by means of the following self-interference
cancellation (SIC). Accordingly, the proposed technique
employs the pre-demodulation samples after the OLA with
the SIC, i.e.
r00m,n ¼
r0m,n ÿ

(17)
In the above equation, a^LS=DDm,i is obtained by the CE
conducted in the on-time symbol and the summation term
is employed for the purpose of IBI regeneration and
cancellation. The aforementioned SIC method following
the OLA can effectively reduce error probabilities (or error
floors) in interference-dominant environments.
5 Comparative simulation
experiments
The system parameters of the PRwZP-OFDM
communication system investigated here are listed in
Table 1. They are obtained from the EU-IST-MATRICE
[25] and EU-IST-4MORE projects [26]. A channel
model defined in Table 2, also obtained from the EU-IST-
MATRICE and EU-IST-4MORE projects [25, 26], is
employed in the following simulation experiments. The
rural area (RA) channel model employed here therefore has
a mean excess delay of 116.118 ns and a root-mean-square
(rms) delay spread of 125.031 ns. From Table 1, the PRP
duration is found to be 2.22 ms, which is much longer than
four times the rms delay spread of the channel [27]. Unlike
the previous studies [12–14], only uncoded OFDM is
taken care of in the following simulation experiments to
make fair comparisons of the CE performance solely for
clarity and to avoid assistance from error correcting coding.

obtained using the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)
CE technique presented in earlier works [12–14], the LS/
DD and ALS techniques proposed here based on either the
conventional PRP-OFDM structure or the PRwZP-OFDM
structure in the 4MORE RA environments when a
maximum mobile speed of 30 km/h exists. Meanwhile,
shown in Figs. 4 and 5 are those when a maximum mobile
speed of 200 km/h exists. The zero-forcing (ZF) CE
method studied in earlier works [12–14] was not taken into
comparison because it actually suffers from possible
divergence and noise enhancement problems. In these
figures, the Cramer–Rao bounds (CRBs) modified from the
previous study [19, 28] are also plotted as effective
benchmarks. Seven things can be observed from these
figures. First, the MMSE CE technique [12–14] can work
only on a slowly time-varying multipath channel as shown in
Figs. 2 and 3. Second, the MMSE CE technique [12–14]
has high MSEs at a mobile speed of 200 km/h. Third,
when the MMSE CE technique [12–14] operates on a
slowly time-varying multipath channel as shown in Figs. 2
and 3, the longer the accumulation duration is, the lower the
MSEs can achieve. This is mainly because the longer
accumulation duration of the moving averager can reduce ISI
and IBI more effectively by its narrower-bandwidth filtering.
Fourth, the proposed techniques, ALS or LS/DD CE, can
achieve lower MSEs than the MMSE CE technique [12–
14]. Fifth, the LS/DD and ALS CE techniques based on
the PRwZP-OFDM structure can achieve lower MSEs than
those based on the conventional PRP-OFDM structure by
taking advantage of the SIC approach and the partial GI.
Sixth, the differences of the MSEs between the LS/DD
and ALS CE techniques are minor. Seventh, the MSEs
obtained using LS/DD and ALS are close to the CRBs
derived in earlier studies [19, 28], especially, in noise-
dominant environments.
Shown in Figs. 6–9 are the bit-error rates (BERs) against
time-average Eb/N0 obtained using the MMSE CE
technique presented in earlier works [12–14] and the
techniques proposed here under either the conventional
PRP-OFDM structure or the proposed PRwZP-OFDM
structure in the 4MORE RA environments when
maximum mobile speeds of 30, 100, 200 or 300 km/h
exist. In these figures, the curves marked as ‘Z ¼ 4’,
‘Z ¼ 8’, ‘Z ¼ 16’ and ‘Z ¼ 32’ represent results from the
MMSE CE in the previous study that used a moving
averager with an accumulation duration of 4, 8, 16 and 32
OFDM symbols. These figures show that the conventional
techniques [12–14] can only work on a slowly time-varying
channel, e.g. 30 km/h, and that it has high error
probabilities at a mobile speed of 100 km/h or higher.

6 Conclusion
A CE technique based on either the LS/DD or the ALS
method for a PRwZP-OFDM communication operating in
a mobile environment has been thoroughly investigated. The
proposed technique outperforms the technique presented in
earlier studies [12–14] by taking advantage of the
interference regeneration/cancellation method in
conjunction with the above effective CE methods.
Obviously, the LS/DD CE can achieve lower BER than the
other techniques compared here. The proposed technique
employing either the LS/DD or the ALS method can
significantly improve the CE performance while slightly
increasing computational complexity. The main advantage
of the proposed technique is its ability to estimate and track
the channel variations by effectively exploiting either the
LS/DD or ALS CE method. The improvements made by
the proposed technique grow significant as mobile OFDM
communications are often expected to operate in high-
mobility environments where the techniques presented in
the previous studies [12–14] do not perform very well.

Least-Squares Channel Estimation for Mobile
OFDM Communication on Time-Varying
Frequency-Selective Fading Channels
Jia-Chin Lin, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—A least-squares (LS) channel estimation (CE) tech-
nique for mobile orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) communications over a rapidly time-varying frequency-
selective fading channel is investigated in this paper. The proposed
technique keeping the comb-type pilot arrangement can achieve
a low error probability by accurately estimating channel impulse
response (CIR) and effectively tracking rapid CIR time variations.
The LS CE technique proposed here is conducted in the time
domain (TD).Meanwhile, a generic estimator is serially performed
block by block without assistance from a priori channel informa-
tion and without increasing computational complexity. By taking
advantage of linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) or pseudoran-
dom signals transceived for jointly sounding pilot subchannels,
the proposed LS CE can inherently perform pseudonoise (PN)
matched filtering (MF) to suppress multipath interference (MPI)
caused by frequency-selective fading and intercarrier interfer-
ence (ICI) resulting from data subchannels. The optimality of
the proposed technique is verified by taking Cramer–Rao lower
bounds (CRLBs) into comparison both on noise- and interference-
dominant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, the
dual optimality of the LFM and PN pilot symbols is verified
for both TD and frequency-domain (FD) CEs. Furthermore, the
proposed technique also exhibits good resistance against residual
timing errors occurring with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
demodulation. Extensive computer simulations in conjunction
with statistical derivations show the superiority of the proposed
technique.

channel-estimation (CE) technique for coherent OFDM com-
munications is highly desired for the purpose of demodulating/
detecting received signals, improving system performance, and
tracking time-varying multipath channels, particularly for mo-
bile OFDM. This is because it often operates in environments
where signal reception is inevitably accompanied by wide
Doppler spreads caused by rapidly dynamic surroundings, as
well as long multipath delay spreads caused by time dispersion.
Much research effort has been made in dealing with various
CE and/or subsequent equalization problems by estimating
subchannel gains or channel impulse response (CIR). Very
often, CE techniques in OFDM systems exploit several pilot
symbols transceived at given locations of the frequency–time
grid for the purpose of sounding relevant channel parameters.
Several previous studies have investigated the performance
of CE techniques assisted by various allocation patterns of
the pilot/training symbols [4]–[7]. Meanwhile, several prior
CEs have simultaneously exploited both time- and frequency-
directional correlations of the channel under investigation [8]–
[10]. In practice, these 2-D estimators requiring 2-D Wiener
filters are often too complicated to be applicably implemented.
Moreover, it is also difficult to achieve any superiority obtained
using a 2-D estimator as expected, even at the cost of high
computational complexity [11]. As a result, serially exploiting
the correlation properties in the time and frequency directions
may be preferred [8] for the purpose of both reducing com-
plexity and keeping good estimation performance. In mobile
environments, channel tap-weighting coefficients are rapidly
very often changing. Hence, the comb-type pilot pattern where
pilot symbols are inserted and time-continuously transmitted
over specific pilot subchannels in all OFDM blocks is naturally
preferred and highly desirable to effectively and accurately
track channel time variations [4]–[6], [12].
The conventional CEs assisted by comb-type pilot subchan-
nels are often completely performed in the frequency domain
(FD) involving two steps: 1) jointly estimating the channel
gains on all pilot subchannels and 2) smoothing the obtained
estimates to interpolate the channel gains on data (nonpilot)
subchannels. The comb-type pilot arrangement (CTPA) CE
technique [12] and the pilot-symbol-assisted modulation CE
technique [13] have been shown as practical and applicable
methods for mobile OFDM communication because their ca-
pability of tracking rapidly time-varying channels is much
better than that of a block-type pilot arrangement CE tech-
nique. Several modified variants for further improvements and
for complexity or rank reduction by means of singular value

notes the number of pilot subchannels; Nsp denotes the pilot-
subchannel separation, which is an odd number in the studied
case; Dk′ represents the k
′th information-bearing data symbol;
Ivsc stands for the index set of the virtual subchannels; and Ipsc
stands for the index set of the pilot subchannels. The block
modulation of OFDM can be reformulated in the following
matrix operation:

which is the TD sequence resulting from the information-
bearing QPSK symbols modulated on the data (nonpilot) sub-
channels. In accordance with the central limit theorem, x˜n, n =
0, 1, . . . , N − 1 are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
zero-mean Gaussian random variables with variance ((N −
Nv −Np)/N)σ2Xk , where σ2Xk is the transmitted signal power.
After the TD signal x is obtained by conducting IDFT
modulation, a cyclic prefix (CP) with length L is inserted,
and thus, the complex baseband transmitted signal s can be
expressed as
s = GI · x = GI · FI ·X ∈ C(N+L)×1 (5)
where
GI =
[
0L×(N−L) IL
IN
]
∈ N (N+L)×N .
GI is a matrix for CP insertion, I is an identity matrix with
its size in the subscript, and 0 is a matrix whose entries
are all zeros with its size in the subscript. The transmitted
signal s is fed into a parallel-to-serial operator, a digital-to-
analog converter, a symbol shaping filter, and, finally, a radio
frequency modulator for transmission. For complex baseband
signals, the equivalent baseband representation of a multipath
channel can be expressed as h˜(t, τ) =
∑
m′ hm′(t)δ(τ − τm′),
where t denotes the time parameter, hm′(t) represents the
m′th tap-weighting coefficient, and τ is the delay parameter.
The aforementioned 2-D channel model follows the wide-
sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) assumption.
Based on the WSSUS and quasi-stationary assumptions, the
channel tap-weighting coefficients are time varying but do not
significantly change within a single OFDM block duration
whose length is NTs, where Ts is the sampling period. Since
fractional duration (i.e., in a fraction of Ts) delays or paths are
not taken into consideration in this paper, for some given time
instant, the aforementioned tapped-delay-line channel model
can be thought of as a CIR. Therefore, the channel model
can be rewritten in a discrete-time form for simplicity as
h = {hm} ∈ CLc×1, where Lc depends on the multipath delay
3542 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 57, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2008
where the superscript (·)H denotes the Hermitian operator, and
c¯0 =
{
c¯0p,q
} ∈ CN×Np
c¯0p,q = x¯|p−q|N , 0 ≤ p ≤ N − 1; 0 ≤ q ≤ Np − 1.
In practice, a residual timing error that occurs with the
DFT demodulation process inherently leads to phase errors in
rotating the demodulated symbols. The phase errors caused
by a timing error d are linearly dependent on both the timing
error d and the subchannel index k. Any small residual timing
error can severely degrade the transmission performance in all
the previous studies exploiting the two-stage CTPA CEs [12]–
[18]. On the other hand, the proposed technique has a higher
level of tolerance to a timing error. Because the timing error d
that occurs with the received training sequence (i.e., delayed
replica of x¯) is naturally the same as the error that occurs
with the received data sequence (i.e., delayed replica of x˜),
the extra phase errors inserted onto the demodulated symbols
on individual subchannels are inherently the same as those
occurring with the estimates of subchannel gains. Therefore, the
extra phase rotations in the proposed technique can completely
be removed in the succeeding single-tap equalization process
conducted on individual subchannels. As a result, the proposed
technique can effectively deal with the problem caused by a
residual timing error.
III. COMPARISONS IN THEORY
A. MSEs
Mean-square estimation errors (MSEs) of the proposed tech-
nique will be derived here to build benchmarks in theory;
meanwhile, performance comparisons among the proposed
technique and other techniques in previous studies [12]–[17]
will be made in this section.
1) TDLS: By proceeding with the previously written deriva-
tions, n˜0 = c˜0 · g + n0 can easily be shown to have mean
vector Mn˜0 and covariance matrix Kn˜0 , which are written as
follows:
Mn˜0 =0N×1
Kn˜0 =E
{
n˜0n˜
H
0
}
= KN + KI (10)
where E{·} denotes the expectation operation; the elements
of c˜0 resulting from x˜n are i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian ran-
dom variables with variance ((N −Nv −Np)/N)σ2Xk , KN =
σ2nIN , and KI = E{c˜0ggH c˜H0 } = σ2IIN , with σ2I = ((N −
Nv −Np)/N)σ2X
∑Np−1
m=0 |gm|2. As a result, the likelihood
function of r0 can be expressed as
f(r0;g)=
1
piNdet(Kn˜0)
exp
[−(r0−c¯0g)HK−1n˜0 (r0−c¯0g)]
(11)
where det(·) denotes the determinant operator, Kn˜0 can be
substituted by σ2T IN , and σ
2
T = σ
2
N + σ
2
I .
If mobile OFDM communication systems operate in environ-
ments with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, interference
is negligible while it is compared with noise, i.e.,
Kn˜0
.
= σ2nIN . (12)
From (11), the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimation
can be accomplished in theory, and the CRLB being attained
here can directly be found by means of the CRLB theorem,
which is formulated here as [30]
∂
∂g
log f(r0;g) =
c¯H0 c¯0
σ2n
[(
c¯H0 c¯0
)−1
c¯H0 r0 − g
]
. (13)
As a result, it can be learned from (13) that the proposed
TDLS estimator, which is written as ĝTDLS = (c¯H0 c¯0)
−1c¯H0 r0
in (9), evidently arrives at the MVU estimation under low SNR
conditions, and its covariance matrix, which is also obtained
from (13), can be written as
K
ĝTDLS
= σ2n
(
c¯H0 c¯0
)−1
.
Because (c¯H0 c¯0)
−1 = (Npσ2X)
−1INp can easily be proven since
the columns of c¯0 are mutually orthogonal with one another, the
covariance matrix of ĝTDLS can furthermore be written as
K
ĝTDLS
=
1
Npγ¯e
INp (14)
where γ¯e = (σ
2
X/σ
2
n). Since ĝ
TDLS is the MVU, the diagonal
elements of K
ĝTDLS
represent the CRLBs. Meanwhile, the
MSE on a subchannel can be evaluated as
MSEper-subchannel = tr(KĝTDLS) = γ¯
−1
e (15)
where tr(·) means taking the trace of a matrix.
In practice, if the transmission system operates on a Rayleigh
flat-fading channel, the bit error probability can be derived as
[32], [33]
Pb,Rayleigh(γ¯b)
.

1

(
1−
√
γ¯b
1 + γ¯b
)
(16)
where γb and γ¯b are the instantaneous and time-averaged SNR
per bit, respectively. Under the commonly used assumption of
employing ideal front-end bandpass filters with bandwidths of
1/Ts, γb has the same value as Eb/N0. If the communication
system operates on a multipath fading channel consisting of Lc
resolvable independent Rayleigh-faded propagation paths, the
bit error probability when the signals on multiple transmission
paths are received by means of a multipath diversity combining
technique based on the maximum ratio combining (MRC)
criterion can be formulated as [32], [33]

where γ¯b,l denotes the time-averaged SNR per bit on the lth
propagation path. However, when the signals are received by
means of a multipath diversity combining method based on the
3544 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 57, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2008
multipath diversity combining based on the EGC criterion, the
symbol and bit error probabilities can be derived as

where U and V can be proven independent according to the
WSSUS assumption.
3) FDLS: The MSE of FDLS [12]–[17] followed by the
transform-domain interpolation (TFDI) method [28] on each
subchannel in the FD can be derived as follows: 1) By the
linear model estimation [30], the MSE of the pilot-subchannel
estimation can be expressed as MSEpilot-subchannel = γ¯
−1
e .
2) Based on TFDI [28], the estimates of the pilot sub-
channels have to be transformed into the TD. Therefore,
the MSE on a TD sample after the IDFT can be written
as MSEper-TD-sample = (Np/N)γ¯
−1
e . 3) Only leading N
′
p =
[N/Nsp]r TD samples are effective, where [N/Nsp]r denotes
taking the closest integer apart from the value ofN/Nsp; the re-
minder TD samples should be forced to be zeros. Then, leading
N ′p active TD samples padded by (N −N ′p) zeros have to be
multiplied by a factor of
√
N/N ′p for normalization. 4) The re-
sultant N TD samples must be transformed back to the FD.
By following the aforementioned procedure and after some
manipulations, the MSE per subchannel can be expressed as
MSEper-subchannel=
N ′p

(24)
Nevertheless, the ICI has never been taken into account in (24)
due to the derivation difficulty in FD operations. This is the
main reason why none of the previous research compared in
this paper took interference into investigation [6]–[17]; instead,
FD signal processing can conduct an ICI-free CE.
IV. COMPARISONS IN PRACTICE
The fundamental requirements of the mobile environments
considered and the parameters of the OFDM communications
investigated here are shown in Table I. The commonly used
tapped-delay-line channel model was employed in the fol-
lowing simulation experiments. In addition, a Jakes’ Rayleigh
fader [31] was used to simulate the time-varying channel tap-
weighting coefficients. The rural area (RA) environment with
the power intensity profile listed in Table II was also employed
in the simulation experiments. These parameters were all taken
from previous studies in EU-IST-MATRICE [2] and EU-IST-
4MORE [3].
A. MSE Comparison
Fig. 3 shows the MSEs obtained using the proposed tech-
nique (TDLS) and the previous studies [12]–[17] consisting
of the pilot-subchannel estimation based on either the FDLS,
TABLE I
OFDM SYSTEM PARAMETERS
TABLE II
RA CHANNEL MODELED BY A TAPPED DELAY LINE
LMMSE, or SVD technique followed by TFDI [28], linear
interpolation (LI), or second-order polynomial interpolation
(SOPI) on a time-varying multipath channel, which was mod-
eled as a tapped delay line with RA power intensity profile
drawn from Table II. It can be seen from this figure that
the simulation results of the proposed technique are close to
the analysis results, particularly in the noise-dominant SNR
range, that error floors are observed using the techniques com-
pared here in the interference-dominant SNR range, that the
simulation results of the proposed technique are higher than
the analysis results in the interference-dominant SNR range
because the analysis results were obtained by assuming that σ2T
is independent of g, and that TDLS proposed here can achieve
lower MSEs than all the previous studies compared [12]–[17],
whose MSEs exhibit even higher error floors resulting from
irreducible ICI.
B. Bit-Error-Rate Comparison
Fig. 4 shows the bit error probabilities obtained using the
perfect CE, the proposed technique with either LFM or SPPPR
sequences as the pilot symbols, and the previous studies [12]–
[17] consisting of the pilot-subchannel estimation based on
either the FDLS, LMMSE, or SVD technique followed by
TFDI [28] on a single-path Rayleigh fading channel where
the highest mobile speed is 300 km/h. The TFDI method [28]
was employed for data-subchannel interpolation in the previous
studies compared here for fair comparisons with the proposed
3546 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 57, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2008
Fig. 5. Comparison of CE performance in terms of bit error probability in the RA environment defined in Table II.
and 6) SVD/TFDI has the same bit error probabilities as those
of LMMSE/TFDI. It definitely makes sense that SVD/TFDI
and LMMSE/TFDI should have very close bit error probabil-
ities because SVD is often applied to achieve LMMSE with
rank reduction. The main reason why FDLS/TFDI has higher
bit error probabilities than SVD/TFDI and LMMSE/TFDI has
previously been explained [12]–[17]. These studies [12]–[17]
also seem likely to show the superiority of SVD and LMMSE
over FDLS.
Fig. 5 shows the bit error probabilities obtained using TDLS
with either LFM or SPPPR pilot symbols, and the previous
studies [12]–[17] consisting of the pilot-subchannel estimation
based on either the FDLS or SVD technique followed by either
the LI or TFDI [28] method in the RA environment. The
channel tap-weighting coefficients were simulated by indepen-
dent Jakes’ Rayleigh faders while the highest mobile speed is
300 km/h. Since the LMMSE technique achieves the same per-
formance as the SVD technique, the simulation results obtained
using LMMSE were not shown in this figure. Six things can
be seen in Fig. 5: 1) The simulation results obtained using the
perfect CE method are similar to the analysis results derived in
(18); 2) the performances of FDLS and SVD in terms of bit er-
ror probability are not significantly different with the two kinds
of pilot symbols employed, i.e., either LFM or SPPPR; 3) TFDI
[28] can achieve lower error probabilities than LI can for any
specific pilot-subchannel estimation technique; 4) negligible
performance variations caused by the different pilot symbols
(i.e., either LFM or SPPPR) occur with the proposed technique;
5) FDLS sometimes has slightly higher bit error probabilities
than SVD; and 6) the proposed technique can achieve lower
bit error probabilities than all of the previous works compared
here [12]–[17]. Meanwhile, after conducting numerical integra-
tion on a computer, PI.-D.,s = 1.85394× 10−2 and PI.-D.,b =
9.26969× 10−3 are obtained using (23). Although the value
of PI.-D.,b is slightly higher than the error floor (roughly,
8× 10−3) read in Fig. 5, (23) offers good insights on the
error floors caused by ICI, and it furthermore supports a close
reference level for error floors in theory under interference-
dominant conditions. The main reason why the value of PI.-D.,b
is slightly higher than the error floor obtained using TDLS by
computer simulation is because (23) was actually derived under
the worst-case assumption that Np (> Lc) equal-power i.i.d.
resolvable paths exist on the WSSUS channel.
In this simulation experiment, SVD was able to reduce the
rank to 19 and keep the same performance as LMMSE, whereas
the ordinary LMMSE had a full rank of Np = 32. In fact, a
generic estimator of the proposed technique can be built in
advance, and the technique can thus be serially performed block
by block while keeping its computational complexity close to
that of the generic estimator of either SVD or LMMSE [12]–
[17]. The proposed technique can be interpreted as applying
Np in-band training sequences with PN-like properties simul-
taneously transceived for the purpose of jointly sounding the
Np specific pilot subchannels. Because the TDLS technique is
employed, no a priori knowledge of the channel is required,
and no severe model mismatch problem will occur with the
proposed technique. Finally, it should be remarked that the
theoretical bit error probabilities in Figs. 4 and 5 may be slightly
higher than the simulation results obtained using the perfect
CE on the low SNR values. This is, in fact, caused by the
approximation that a Q2(·) term has been neglected and has
not been taken into account since (16) and (18) were derived
for simplicity.
C. Resistance Against Timing Errors
Figs. 6 and 7 show the bit error probabilities obtained using
the compared techniques tested in environments identical to
3548 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 57, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2008
does not exhibit the model mismatch problem, and FDLS/TFDI
can achieve sufficiently low bit error probabilities. In addition,
FDLS/LI and FDLS/SOPI have higher error probabilities than
FDLS/TFDI because LI and SOPI still cannot completely over-
come the extra phase rotations caused by residual timing errors.
On the other hand, the bit error probabilities obtained here using
the proposed technique are close to those shown in Figs. 4 and 5
using the perfect timing synchronization assumption. This indi-
cates that the proposed technique has a high level of tolerance
to timing errors that occur in the DFT demodulation.
D. Further Comparisons
Earlier studies have mentioned that SVD can dramatically
reduce the computational complexity from the orderN or from
the order L of LMMSE to the order of SVD (i.e., 19 in the stud-
ied case) by means of rank reduction in the pilot-subchannel
estimation stage and can further reduce the computational
complexity from TFDI [28] to SOPI or LI while retaining good
CE performance [12]–[17]. These studies also mention that
FDLS has higher error probabilities than SVD and LMMSE
because it suffers from the noise enhancement problem [12]–
[17]. The good performance of SVD or LMMSE can also be
seen in the previous simulation results, as shown in Fig. 4, but
this may be true only in the special environments such as those
employed in Fig. 4 or those used in the previous study [12],
where frequency selectivity or multipath fading is insignificant
so that the received signals only suffer from almost frequency-
flat channel fading, and no timing error exists. On the contrary,
it can be observed in Fig. 5 that while frequency selectivity in
conjunction with time selectivity corrupts the received signals,
SVD and LMMSE cannot achieve any superiority over FDLS,
even with high computational complexity and with assistance
from the complicated TFDI [28]. However, a timing error can
completely destroy LI and SOPI by introducing extra phase
rotations. As a result, TFDI [28] is certainly highly desired to
achieve good interpolation performance. Thus, the complexity
of the data-subchannel interpolation subsystem used in the
conventional FD CE exploiting CTPA cannot easily be reduced,
although LI and SOPI were very often considered essential
parts for complexity reduction in the previous studies. Even-
tually for a CTPA OFDM system, as mentioned in the previous
sections, the computational complexity in the pilot-subchannel
estimation stage may be reduced in theory, from the order of
Np (32 in the studied case) to the order of SVD (19 in the
studied case), or even further by means of the order-recursive
LS algorithm [30], but neither from N nor from L to the order
of SVD.
In fact, the LS CEs (either FDLS/TFDI or TDLS) studied
here have a much better ability to track rapid channel variations
than either SVD or LMMSE with either LI, SOPI, or TFDI, be-
cause the LS techniques estimate the current CIR by exploiting
the on-time received signals block by block with no assistance
from preceding, preprocessed/stored, or presumed a priori
channel information that is absolutely required in LMMSE and
SVD. Since CTPA has been proven more suitable in high-
mobility environments, the FDLS/TFDI and TDLS techniques
investigated in this paper must be highly preferred for the sake
of accurately estimating and tracking the rapidly time-varying
channels.
It is remarked that FDLS/TDFI and TDLS can achieve lower
error probabilities in a frequency-selective environment where
a residual timing error exists, as shown in Fig. 7, than those
can in a frequency-selective environment where no timing error
exists, as shown in Fig. 5. The main reasons are explained in
the following. On the delay space, a residual timing error does
not change the order of inherent multipath diversity if it is
shorter than the CP length, and thus, no ISI results. Since the
frequency/multipath diversity is kept, the joint estimations of
pilot-subchannel weights can effectively work in both of the
aforementioned environments. On the other hand, a residual
timing error undoubtedly introduces an extra phase rotation,
which linearly depends on the subchannel index and on the
value of the timing error, onto an individual subchannel. In
addition, a residual timing error will cyclically fold the impulse
response of the multipath channel. Therefore, a residual timing
error makes the transfer function to be estimated become more
linear-phase. Furthermore, TFDI can be thought of as conduct-
ing ideal low-pass filtering on an FD sequence of subchannel
weights. Since a residual timing error actually reshapes the
transfer function to be estimated by inserting a linear phase onto
individual subchannels, it therefore helps TFDI effectively filter
out all the subchannel weights because the transfer function
with a residual timing error tends to be more linear-phase than
that with no residual timing error. In other words, the more-
linear-phase sequence of subchannel weights can more easily
pass through TFDI, which is definitely an ideal low-pass filter
with a linear-phase transfer function, with better interpolation
results. Eventually, FDLS/TDFI and TDLS (neither FDLS/LI
nor FDLS/SOPI) can achieve slightly lower error probabilities
in a frequency-selective environment where a residual timing
error exists than those in a frequency-selective environment
with no residual timing error.
1) Optimality Verification of Pilot Symbols: Training se-
quences with impulse-like correlation functions are effective for
channel sounding and CE [26], [27], [34]. In [34], LS filtering in
TD for CE has been thoroughly studied, and optimal binary se-
quences were exhaustively searched for by the following search
criterion: F = tr(Φ−1), where Φ is the correlation matrix of
the training sequence. To strictly keep the CTPA structure,
the spectra of the training sequence x¯ can occupy only the
Np pilot subchannels for reducing ICI expanded onto the data
subchannels. By following the definitions and evaluations used
in previous studies [26], [27], [34], the TD training sequence
used in either TDLS/LFM or TDLS/SPPPR can achieve F and
normalized signal-to-estimation-error ratio (SER) as follows:
FTDLS =tr

= 4.580602× 10−2
SERTDLS = 10 log10

= 13.39 (in decibels).
(25)
Since both LFM and SPPPR pilot symbols have the same
uniformly distributed magnitude spectra allocated on the pilot
subchannels, both of them can reach the minimum achievable

operates around 5.8 GHz. In addition, this application
is usually for V2I or I2V. The parameters employed in
IEEE 802.11p are listed in Table I. IEEE 802.11p adopts
the same physical layer (PHY) of 802.11a, with the only
exception that a 10 MHz channel bandwidth is used in
802.11p.
The proposed PRP-OFDM transceiver is depicted in
Fig. 1. Sm,N is the resultant signal at the modulator
output. The optional signal mapping schemes, e.g., BPSK,
QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM, are utilized by the trans-
mission unit. xm,N is the results of the source data stream
Sm,N modulated by an inverse discrete Fourier transform
(IDFT). The comb-type pilot symbols are inserted on
the given subcarriers for CE, located on the -21st, -7th,
7th and 21st subcarriers. As is detailed in J.-C. Lin, [9],
the prefix pL is inserted prior to the information-bearing
symbol transmission, which consists in this paper of a
15-bit PN-sequence and a 1-bit zero padding. pL can be
represented as [1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 1 -1 0]. To
make the prefix exhibit in a flat power spectrum, the PN
sequence has to be shifted 1 bit per symbol. Therefore
the employed prefix not only owns the optimum property
for acting as training sequence as mentioned in the text-
book; e.g. Adaptive Filter Theory by Simon Haykin [13],
but also introduces minimum self interference. At the
receiving unit, after time synchronization is completed,
the prefix is removed and then the signal is fed into the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) demodulation.
According to the Channel 172, a safety-oriented appli-
cation defined in IEEE 802.11p, there are two network
traffic types: periodic transmission and event-triggered
transmission [14]. The periodic traffic is a broadcast
sequence of data symbols whose preambles may not
exist, e.g., construction zone warnings. The event traffic
includes preambles and data symbols, e.g., intersection
collision warning/avoidance.
The impact of channel interference on inter-vehicle
communications fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably, and
therefore several impairments, such as path loss, shadow-
ing and narrow-band fading, are often used to characterize
the channel. As a result, the fading channel is referred to
as a rapidly time-varying channel. Path loss and shad-
owing effects are usually dealt with by automatic power
control or diversity techniques. The Rician distribution
model is often employed to describe the scenario where
a LOS propagation exists; meanwhile, the Rayleigh dis-
tribution model is known to be a good model in non-
LOS (NLOS) cases. In addition, the channel models
addressed in [15], which were open-space small-scale
fading models measured by the IEEE 802.11 working
group at the Georgia Institute of Technology, are used
to evaluate system performance. The channel parameters
used in this paper are listed in Table II. These small-scale
fading models only represent multipath fading effects and
do not include path loss or shadowing.
III. PROPOSED CHANNEL ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE
The system architecture of the current IEEE 802.11p
standard and the proposed PRP-OFDM system have been
outlined in Section II. The TD CE techniques proposed for
IEEE 802.11p are derived in this section. To improve CE
performance while keeping the specifications unchanged
is the primary goal of this study.
A. TD Least Square Estimation (TDLSE)
1) Definition: As shown in Fig. 1, the received OFDM
symbol r consists of the prefix vector rm,L and the data
vector rm,N . As a result, rm,L can be written as
rm,L = Mhm + wm,N ,
where M is the transmitted prefix, hm is the CIR at the
mth symbol, and wm,N is the Additive White Gaussian
Noise (AWGN) vector whose elements have the common
variance σ2n.
In the TD CE method proposed here, M results from
the training sequence conveyed in the prefix pL, which
can be written as
pL =
[
p1 p2 · · · pL−1 pL
]T
.
Then, the matrix M can be formulated as
M =

2) Pre-calculation: By taking advantage of the fact
that (MHM)−1MH can be pre-calculated and stored in
advance, the TDLSE algorithm can be computed on a
symbol-by-symbol basis with low computational com-
plexity.
3) On-time calculation: The received signal in the
observation window is

D. Channel Tracking (CT)
The CT method adopts the estimates obtained in the
preambles as initial weights, and it updating the initial
weights with the variation obtained via comparing the
pilots and initial weights. Following the IEEE 802.11p
standard, one pilot updates adjacent 12 subcarriers [4],
[5]. For example, the current estimates of pilots are hT,n,
where n represents the pilot location. The CIR hp is
estimated by preambles. Thus, the CT CIR h¯p can be
formulated as
h¯p =
hp,n
hT,n
· hp.
When CT is used in the proposed TDLSE algorithm, the
CIR hp is estimated by the prefix. The simulation in next
section will test the conventional pilot allocation assisted
from the CT by preambles and TDLSE assisted from the
CT by the prefix.
IV. SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS
Bit error rate (BER) performances of the conventional
CP-OFDM, as defined in the IEEE 802.11p standard, was
compared with those obtained using the proposed tech-
niques. The simulation scenario was one OBU communi-
cation with one RSU. The signal mapping type used was
QPSK. Each packet consisted of a preamble and either
10 or 64 data symbols; 10 data symbols are simulated
here for event traffic, and 64 data symbols are simulated
for periodic traffic. The speeds and environments tested
in this paper were 120 km/h for urban and rural envi-
ronments and 140 km/h on the expressway. The Jakes
Rayleigh fader [17] was used to simulate the time-varying
channel tap-weighting coefficients. All simulations were
conducted for a transmission spanning 10 seconds. The
fundamental requirements of mobile applications and the
parameters of the channel models are shown in Tables I
and II. The CE techniques compared in this paper are as
follows:
• TDLSE.
• TDLSE with TD filtering: in this simulation, it
takes five estimates to conduct the filtering procedure
introduced in Section 3.2. In addition, L in (1) is set
to 16.
• TDLSE with SIC.
• TDLSE with CT: as described in the previous sec-
tion. Prefix assisted CT for TDLSE will be simu-
lated.
• Conventional comb-type pilot.
• Conventional comb-type pilot with CT.
• Preamble only: using the estimate from the preamble
to equalize all data symbols in the same packet.

A. Conventional Techniques
BER performances of the conventional techniques are
clearly illustrated in Figs. 2-7. BERs obtained using
the compared techniques in suburban-street scenarios are
shown in Figs. 2 and 3. BERs obtained using the urban
canyon scenarios are also presented in Figs. 4 and 5. The
results obtained from the expressway scenarios can be
found in Figs. 6 and 7.
The simulation results prove that the pilot alloca-
tion in the current standard cannot achieve satisfactory
performance under severe multipath channel conditions,
as the current pilot density is insufficient for accurate
estimation of the channel weights. The other conventional
techniques, such as comb-type pilot with CT and pream-
ble only, can only work appropriately in short-packet
cases. When the packet length increases, regardless of the
type of scenario, the performance degrades dramatically.
The cause of this degradation is that the estimates of
channel weights obtained from preambles cannot support
the estimation for a long time.
B. Proposed Techniques
The proposed techniques can achieve lower BERs as
shown in Figs. 2-7. Three points are worth noting regard-
ing these results. First, Figs. 3, 5 and 7 highlight that
the proposed techniques can still achieve remarkable per-
formance improvements, no matter how long the packet
is. As the proposed techniques are based on symbol-by-
symbol estimation, the estimates are not influenced by the
packet length. In addition, although CT can remarkably
improve the performance in preamble-assisted cases, e.g.,
conventional comb-type pilot with CT, CT in prefix-
assisted TDLSE cases cannot present similarly remarkable
results. The estimates by means of the prefix are not
as accurate as they are in the preamble, and neither
is the improvement as remarkable as preamble-assisted
CT. Moreover, TDLSE with SIC can improve the BER
performance by compensating for the effects of ICI and
IBI.

term testing plans. The former took a long time and large scare
field test in urban canyons and high speed highways where two
cars transmit data to each other for the purpose of observing
the impact of multipath interference and speed effect. The
plan content mentions the following incidents that transmission
shield occasionally happen as the cars are blocked by another
car in between, stops at traffic lights and changes in traffic flow
according to the traffic. On the contrary, the latter includes
a local coverage area and shorter hours to further observe
the relationship of relative velocity and distance change to
communication performance.
The third category mainly discusses designs for system
improvements, focusing on system efficiency enhancements
and current standards improvements. In high mobility, the
concept of midamble [10] in time domain is proposed because
of the low pilot density offered by IEEE 802.11p. [11],
[12] evaluate the midamble efficiency, which; however, will
slow down the effective transmission rate. In order to resolve
this, we have discovered, from some encouraging references,
another method to employ guard interval: ZP-OFDM [13].
Most of the OFDM systems use CP-OFDM. When the length
of cyclic prefix (CP) is longer or equal to the length of
channel impulse response, inter-symbol interference (ISI) can
be avoided. ZP-OFDM offers the same characteristic; also they
exhibit the same spectrum efficiency when the CP length is
equal to the zero padding (ZP) length. In addition, [14], [15]
adopt the method of replacing prefix with pseudo random
sequence and apply it on mobile communication. [16] is used
to avoid the loss of throughput when midamble is increased,
and thus the theories of [14] and [15] are employed to modify
the prefix in CP-OFDM from a CP to a defined signal and
carry out experiments on IEEE 802.11p structure.
The paper will employ a systematic experiment to introduce
telematic related studies conducted by Automotive Research
and Testing Center (ARTC) in Taiwan. The experiment pro-
cedures are carefully established with the plan of the experi-
mental flow, development of the test platform, records of the
field variables, design of the test items and analysis of the
test data to offer a safe, reproducible and objective testing
environment, which can be used as a test field for telematics
related products. The reminder of the paper is organized as
follows. In Section II, the descriptions of the field test flow
and platform development are reviewed, and also the analysis
of the data obtained from the experiment is provided to derive
a software simulation platform with the available literature.
Results with an proposed technique to improve IEEE 802.11p
system will be provided in Section III.
Fig. 2. Field Test Platform.
II. EXPERIMENTAL FLOW AND TEST PLATFORM
DEVELOPMENT
Field tests are a necessary step for leading to a successful
marketing strategy for telematic products, allowing the lab-
developed system to be exposed to the field test. Conditions
in the fields provide more complex parameters than in the
lab, such as the outside electromagnetic interference and other
common elements of temperature, humidity, dust, biological
contamination, and corrosion caused by salt-fog. Therefore,
it is suggested that telematics products are field-tested to be
proven reliable for their functions, under the field conditions
of the vehicle and road-side area.
It is necessary to first check if there is no apparent co-
channel interference present in the field, then to verify the in-
strument has been error calibrated to minimize the error caused
by measurement uncertainty and to secure the precise data.
Finally, it is essential to define the effective coverage range to
establish the starting and finishing points for determining the
real communication distance, length of time, data collection
coverage and corresponding real traffic conditions.
The paper will use the 802.11p-like system operated in
DSRC band as a testing object to complete the field testing
design, exploring the influences of the speed and distance
have on the efficiency of the packet loss and latency of
the communication system. The experimental flow and steps
related to the field test have been organized, as shown in
Fig. 1. However, tests related to field conditions are excluded
from discussion in this paper. According to the experimental
flow shown in Fig. 1, the structure of the corresponding field
test platform is depicted in Fig. 2, consisting of cars loaded
with data acquisition system, photoelectric reflex switch and
Racelogic Velocity BOX (V-BOX) and OBU for speed and
distance tests, fixed roadside units (RSU) and few traffic cone
collars to indicate the starting and finishing points of the
effective communication. The radius of the RSU coverage
range is expressed as the symbol r. Please note that the left
and right sides of the RSU communication coverage are not
necessarily symmetrical.
Instruments and devices are as described in Table I, and the
important specifications, physical measurements and functions
are briefly explained. The DSRC/WAVE compliant Savari
WAVE-BOX device used in the cars and on the roadside can

includes channel conditions under 6 different scenarios. Three
V2R/R2V scenarios are selected for simulations, and they are
120 km/h for the urban canyon, 120 km/h for the suburban
street and 140 km/h for the expressway. The packet length of
each packet is 10 and 64 data symbols. The result is illustrated
in Figs. 4 and 5. The simulation results indicate that the PRP-
OFDM structure with TDLSE is able to increase the system
efficiency.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a
systematic and feasible field testing flow. By selecting a
certificated coastdown test track and open field for experiment
to complete the efficiency evaluation of R2V from field tests.
Two efficiency indicators, packet loss and latency, are used to
close up the primary efficiency analysis of the DSRC system.
In addition, the measurement results not only can provide
suggestions and recommendations to all sorts of vehicle com-
munication, but also act as the baseline result for the efficiency
comparisons on the real road in the future, as well as to offer
better specifications to effectively improve the transmission

Abstract—The primary challenge in the current IEEE 802.11p
draft standard is the weak performance in multipath environ-
ment. Hence a time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD)
channel estimation techniques that can enhance the performance
of channel estimation are proposed in this paper. The TD
technique makes a little modify in current standard to use the
symbol prefix to assist channel estimation and obtain remarkable
improvement. In addition, the FD pseudo-pilot technique change
nothing in the standard and can obtain adequate improvement.
Furthermore, this paper also discuss how to employ the preamble
to improve the FD channel estimation performance. The channel
models adopted for simulation are referencing HIPERLAN/2 and
a modified exponential model.
I. INTRODUCTION
IEEE 802.11p [1], also known as Wireless Access in the
Vehicular Environments (WAVE), is an extension of the IEEE
802.11 family, which employs the mechanisms originally
provided for IEEE 802.11 to operate in the Dedicated Short
Range Communication (DSRC) band to support inter-vehicle
communication and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
applications. DSRC is a short-range wireless communication
technology compliant with the ASTM E2213-03 standard [2]
to work in the 5.9 GHz band in United States or 5.8 GHz band
in Japan and European Union. It offers data communication
between two vehicles (V2V) or that between a vehicles and
a roadside unit (V2I or I2V). The spectrum of DSRC is
partitioned to seven channels whose individual bandwidths are
10 MHz. There are four service channels (SCHs) at Channel
174, 176, 180, 182, one control channel (CCH) at Channel
178, and two special use channels at Channel 172 and 184.
Listed in Table I are the parameters employed in IEEE
802.11p. It actually adopts the same PHY defined previously
for 802.11a, only except for the 10 MHz channel bandwidth
being used. As a result, the transmission rate may probably
reduced to be half of the original. Comb-type pilot signals,
located on -21, -7, 7 and 21, are inserted over the given
subcarriers for channel estimation. The main drawback of
the specifications highly probably falls on insufficient pilot
allocation in the urban areas. Although the comb-type pilot
arrangement are capable in fast fading channels, the pilot
organization of IEEE 802.11p standard does not perform well
in urban environments, where multipath fading is severe and

thus delay spreads may be long [3]. In order to solve the pilot
insufficiency in the current draft standard; the previous studies
[3]-[5] utilized midamble to enhance the channel estimation
(CE) performance. In these studies midamble worked like
block-type pilots did, which are located in the stream of data
symbols. The packet structure is shown in Fig. 1. However,
it is apparent that the midamble may trade the throughput of
data transmission for improving CE performance.
In order to avoid the multipath effect mentioned above, a
strategy to compensate the multipath must be well developed.
For enhancing CE performance in an OFDM communication,
utilizing pseudo-random sequences has been proposed. In [7],
it provides an idea of utilizing the pseudo-random sequence
to insert into guard interval. Our related researches also
be applied in mobile OFDM communication systems [8]-
[11]. All of them have employed pseudo random sequence
to perform time-domain channel estimation and carried out
simulations for high-mobility environments around 5 GHz.
[12] has introduced a practical sequenced OFDM technique
for vehicular communication, and has also proposed a time-
domain channel estimation method for IEEE 802.11p. The
proposed technique assisted from insert Zadoff-Chu sequence
in prefix, and exhibits lower error probabilities achieve by
getting more perceive estimations of CIR.
For fast or multipath fading, if the deep fading happens
between two pilots, linear interpolation could not accurately

Techniques discussed in this paper are as follows:
A. TD LS estimation (TDLSE) with FD filtered
Fig. 2 depicts the transceiver structure of the IEEE 802.11p,
where xn is the results of source data stream SN modulated
by an IDFT. In addition, the commonly-seen postfix is moved
to be prefix in PRP-OFDM in order to comply with the prefix
structure of the CP-OFDM. In other words, the prefix pL is
inserted prior to the data symbol which consists of a PN-
sequence, [1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 1 -1 0], in this
paper.
The proposed TD CE technique obtains the estimate of CIR
by analyzing the receiving training sequence. As shown in Fig.
2, the received vector r is the combination of the prefix vector
rCE,L and the data vector rM,N . As a result, the received
vector r can be derived as
r = Mh + w,
where M is transmitted block, h is the CIR, and w is AWGN
vector with the common variance σ2n. In the TD CE method
proposed, M results from the training sequence m conveyed
in prefix, which can be formulated as
m =
[
P1 P2 · · · PL−1 PL

.
The matrix M can be formulated as

.
By means of the LS philosophy, the estimate of CIR can be
formulated as
hˆLS = (M
HM)−1MHr. (2)
hˆLS is CIR in the TD, and thus the transfer function in the
FD for the propose of equalization can be formulated as
Hˆ = FN hˆLS,L+N ,
where FN is the DFT operation; and hˆLS,L+N =[
hˆLS,1 · · · hˆLS,L 0 · · · 0
]T
. Therefore, the output
data S˜1(k) can be obtained as
S˜ = RM/Hˆ.
The FD filtered procedure is based on the LSE. The FD
transfer function are normalized over several preceding and
succeeding symbols. The on-time symbol is finally equalized
by means of the resultant average of FD transfer function. The
initial state of the buffer is filled in the FD transfer function
estimated from preamble.
The LS algorithm is practical, which is very suitable for
satisfying real-time requirements. By taking the advantage
that (MHM)−1MH can be pre-calculated and pre-stored; the
computational complexity of the TDLSE is lower than FD
linear interpolation by comb-type pilot.
Theoretically, TDLSE can obtain better performance than
other algorithms. However, it is not a standardized algorithm in
IEEE 802.11p. So, in this research, TDLSE is the performance
benchmark to evaluate the performance of following pseudo-
pilot algorithm.
B. Pseudo-pilot
The pseudo-pilot procedure in this paper follows the idea
first addressed in [13]. In some cases which multipath or
fast fading bring about the linear interpolation in pilot cannot
obtain accurate channel stste. By using pseudo-pilots, the
pilot density can be raised, and then, the exactitude can be
improved.
According to the theory of [13], the FD pseudo-pilot algo-
rithm can be modified to be capable of channel tracking (CT).
The procedure is as follows:
1) Precalculate:
• Define the regression polynomial qn =
(1, n, n2, · · · , nd)T , where n ∈ pilot position P or
pseudo-pilot position PP , in addition, d is often ≤ 2
[13].
• Q =


...
qTn
...

, 0 ≤ n ≤ l; Qp =


...
qTn
...

, n ∈ P∪PP .
• The received symbols denoted as
Y0, Ypp1, Ypp2, · · · , Yl−1, where Y0 and Yl−1 are
pilots, Ypp1 and Ypp2 are pseudo-pilot.
• Pre-calculate and pre-store M = (QHp Qp)
−1QTp and
MM = (Q
TQ)−1QT .
2) On-time estimation:
• The reference CIR: h˜p = (
Y0
X0
,
Y⌊l/2⌋
X⌊l/2⌋
,
Yl−1
Xl−1
).
• Calculate the least-squares estimates of wholel CIR hˆp
by hˆp = QMh˜p.
• Obtain the possible equalized symbol (Xˆ1, · · · , Xˆl−2) by
hard decision (
Y1
hˆ1
, · · · ,
Yl−1
hˆl−2
), where hˆ1, · · · , hˆl−2 results
from hˆp.

time-variant and severe multipath channel, symbol-by-symbol
method can obtain better performance. However, the TDLSE
have to amend the current standard to insert sequences in
symbol prefix. That makes our proposed CT pesudo-pilot
algorithm become more promising and practical than TDLSE.
V. CONCLUSION
Two novel CE techniques proposed for vehicular com-
munications are introduced in this paper. TDLSE, which
adopts PN-sequence to instate original cyclic prefix in CP-
OFDM could obtain better performance than FD pseudo-pilot
algorithm. Nevertheless, sequenced prefix is not included in
the standard, but while the IEEE 802.11p is a draft standard
yet, TDLSE is still worth researching and standardizing into
the stable standard. On the other hand, the proposed CT
pseudo-pilot algorithm really can prevent multipath and severe
channel condition. In long packet particularly, the CT pseudo-
pilot algorithm will not trade throughput for inserting more
midambles to improve CE performance. The future work of
this research can modify the preamble assisted algorithm to

matrix, i.e., FMF

MFM = IM , where (·)H denotes the
matrix Hermitian operation. The reference signals used for CE
in the LTE specifications are generated from ZC sequences.

where 1 ≤ m ≤ M − 1, q is an integral shift, r is any
integer relatively prime to the sequence length M , and ip
is the time index of pilot symbol. Unlike data signals, the
reference signals are directly conveyed on subcarriers without
pre-coding in a specific time interval (i.e., the 4th symbol in
a time slot) in the LTE uplink transmission.
Due to the variation of channel conditions where different
mobile terminals operate, the BS often has to allocate different
transmission bands to different users. Thus, the pre-coded data
signals and reference signals for specific mobile station should
be mapped onto the band at a given subframe or a transmission
time interval (TTI). Following the LTE specification, a time
slot contains Ns SC-FDM symbols, and a subframe or a
TTI consisting of two consecutive time slots. The mapping
matrix A is used to map the signals to a cluster of localized
subcarriers on the assigned resource block (RB), and the
resultant signals can be expressed as
X˜ = [X(0), X(1), · · · , X(i), · · · , X(N ′s−1)] = A ·XRS ,

where N ′s denotes the number of symbols in a subframe; the
ith column of the M -by-N ′s resource matrix XRS in a normal
CP symbol system can be written as

to the argument and the modulus Ns operation, respectively.
In (6), the matrix consists of an identity matrix I with
size presented in its subscript and two zero matrices whose
elements are all zeros with size in its subscript.
Then, all the mapping signals X˜ are transformed into the
time domain (TD) (similar to those in conventional OFDMA
systems) by an N -point IFFT modulation operation, and this
can be expressed as
x˜ = [x(0), x(1), · · · , x(i), · · · , x(N ′s−1)] = FHN · X˜. (7)
In (4) and (7), the vectors X(i) and x(i) are actually equal to
X′p and x
′
p, respectively, when the symbol index i is one out
of {i||i+ 1|Ns = 4} for a normal CP symbol.
Before transmission, the TD transmitted signals would add
cyclic prefix (CP) with length LG. It can be given by
s˜ = [s(0), s(1), · · · , s(i), · · · , s(N ′s−1)] = G · x˜, (8)
where the CP insertion matrix G has the following form [10]:
G =
[
0LG×(N−LG) ILG
IN
]
(9)
and the ith column vector s(i) denotes the ith SC-FDM
symbol.
After the CP insertion, the transmitted signal s˜ will be
transmitted column by column, that is, from s(0) to s(N
′
s−1).
Thus, the transmitted vector can be expressed as
s˜PS =
[(
s(0)
)T (
s(1)
)T
· · ·
(
s(N
′
s−1)
)T]T
. (10)
Finally, the transmitted signals, including data and pilots,
propagate through a wireless channel.
For the baseband equivalent representation, the wireless
multipath channel based on the wise-sense stationary uncor-
related scattering (WSSUS) assumption can be expressed as
[11]
h˜(t, τ) =
∑
n′
hn′(t)δ(τ − τn′(t)), (11)
where t denotes the time instant, hn′(t) is the n
′th complex
channel-weighting coefficient, and τ represents the path delay
parameter. If the discrete-time channel is modeled as a tapped-
delay-line (TDL), the channel impulse response (CIR) vector
h˜(n) is employed for sample time index n. In the model,
it is assumed that the channel coefficients do not change
significantly within a SC-FDM symbol duration whose length
is NTs, where Ts is the sampling interval. Therefore, the
received signal at the BS can be written as
yr = h˜
(n) ∗ s˜PS , (12)
where ∗ denotes the convolution operator.
If the timing synchronization is perfect and the CP length
LG is sufficiently greater than the maximum CIR length Lc ,
the CP can be removed, and the pilot signal yr,p after the CP
removal can be expressed as
y′p = G

where the CP removal matrix G′ can be written as

the matrix should be updated for a period of time. However,
in this paper, we make a strong assumption that the receiver
completely has the on-time correlation matrix at any instant
in advance [13].
Because the LMMSE can be obtained from RC and Hˆp,LS ,
one can estimate the channel transfer vector using the FDLS
criterion and use the estimation to obtain the FDLMMSE
estimation. The FDLMMSE estimator yields much better per-
formance than the FDLS estimator; especially, in low signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. A major drawback of the
FDLMMSE is its high computational complexity.
C. Frequency-Domain Least-Squares Estimation with Win-
dowing
The FDLS estimator in (25) actually suffers from noise
enhancement problem. In noise-dominant environments, the
FDLS estimator has worse performance than the FDLMMSE
estimator. Therefore, by exploiting the correlation of the
channel transfer function, an estimation based on FDLS with
assistance from FD windowing is proposed to effectively
suppress the noise. In the FDLS with constant windowing
(FDLS/CWD) CE method, a rectangular sliding window is
employed to smooth the estimates on subcarriers obtained by
FDLS CE. The mathematical representation can be formulated
as
Hˆp,FDLS/CWD = diag
−1(DR · zM ) ·DR · Hˆp,FDLS , (31)
where the constant sliding window matrix DR is an M -by-M
matrix whose row vectors represent the sliding window with
finite impulse response (FIR) of length R. The elements of
the matrix DR can be defined as
[DR]mrmc =
{
1, 1− ⌈R2 ⌉ ≤ mc −mr ≤ ⌊R2 ⌋
0, otherwise,
(32)
where mr and mc denote the row index and the column index,
respectively.
The method would be expected to have better CE per-
formance at low SNR values. However, the self-interference
may degrade the performance at high SNR values because
the method is based on the average of the elements in the
constant window (CWD). It is noted that the length of the
sliding window highly depends on the coherence bandwidth
because the coherence bandwidth is a function of the channel
variation rate between the two subcarriers. To reduce the effect
of self-interference at high SNR values, one can choose a
window length less than or equal to the coherence bandwidth
with 0.9 correlation. In general, if we choose a window length
in the appropriate range (less than the coherence bandwidth
with 0.9 correlation), the longer the window length is, the
better the CE performance is at low SNR values. However,
at high SNR values, the CE performance is worse than that
obtained with a shorter window length.
Actually, the receiver cannot know the channel coherence
bandwidth immediately. Thus, it is possible that the window
length chosen is too long. At high SNR values, an improved
method is employed to convert the CWD length into an adap-
tive window (AWD) length to avoid much self-interference
introduced. By using the FDLS estimation results, the variation
rate of the estimated response can be used to determine the
AWD length on every subcarrier, and the maximum AWD
length is upper-bounded by the original CWD length. By the
simulation results in Section IV, the method of using AWD
length at high SNR values can effectively reduce the high error
floor occurring with the CWD length method.
IV. COMPARISONS IN PRACTICE
The SC-FDMA system investigated here is tested in the
environments based on the COST-259 channel model, whose
parameters are listed in Table I. The COST-259 channel model
is a new channel power delay profile model which overcomes
the limitations in the GSM channel models (COST-207) [14].
The model includes consideration of directions of arrival and
is thus suitable for simulations of wireless systems that use
smart antenna like in the LTE [15].
To verify the performance of the CE algorithm proposed
here, the simulations consist of two parts. In the first part,
MSE performances of the pilot subchannel estimators are
taken into comparisons. In the second part, we compare the
BER performances of the different pilot estimation methods
by setting the data subchannel estimation method as the linear
interpolation (LI). In addition, single-tap frequency-domain
equalizer (FDE) will be employed to compensate for the
channel weights on the data subchannels.
A. MSE Comparison
The MSE performances of the different pilot estimation
methods in the COST-259 RA models that consist of eighteen
taps (roughly one-half CP length) are investigated [13].
The MSE performances on the RA120 channel model is
shown in Figs. 3. The FDLMMSE estimator has the best MSE
performance in the simulation results. The MSE floor of the
FDLS/CWD of length 32 is about 8×10−4, and the MSE floor
of the FDLS/CWD of length 16 is roughly 3 × 10−4 since
the FDLS/CWD of length 16 estimator has lower interference
at high SNR values. Meanwhile, the FDLS estimator has the
worst MSE performance at low SNR values.
B. BER Comparison
In Fig. 4, the FDLS/CWD estimators have better perfor-
mances than the FDLS estimator in low SNRs. Their perfor-
mances are similar to the FDLMMSE estimator and very close
to the perfect channel estimation. However, at high SNRs, the
FDLS/CWD of length 32 has more self-interference than the
FDLS/CWD of length 16. The performance of FDLS/CWD
of length 32 is worse than the FDLS estimator, and the
performance of FDLS/CWD of length 16 is close to that of
the FDLS estimator. By switching the FDLS/CWD of length
32 into FDLS with adaptive windowing (FDLS/AWD) at
Eb/N0 = 30 dB, the performance of FDLS/AWD estimator is
close to the conventional estimators at high SNRs. In this case,
the error floor is about 5×10−4. Meanwhile, the performance

Abstract—A least-squares (LS) channel estimation technique
is investigated to extend pseudo-random-postfix orthogonal-
frequency-division multiplexing (PRP-OFDM) techniques onto
mobile applications in rapidly time-variant frequency-selective
fading environments. The proposed method exploits self-
interference cancellation to effectively reduce a variety of inter-
ferences; and thus, it can overcome not only frequency-selectivity
caused by multipath reception but also time-selectivity caused
by mobility; in particular, OFDM communications are often
expected to operate in the presence of both wide Doppler spread
and long delay spread. As a result, the proposed technique can
achieve lower channel estimation errors and lower bit error
probabilities than the conventional techniques exploiting a time-
averaging method. Since sufficiently long PRP sequences have
never been found in the previous works regarding PRP-OFDM,
an application of the proposed technique using chirp signals for
mobile PRP-OFDM communication is investigated because the
chirp signals exhibit good training properties.
I. INTRODUCTION
OFDM communication has been attracting much research
effort because it is a candidate for 4th-generation (4G) mobile
communication in many standards, e.g. IEEE 802.16 and
IEEE 802.20 [1] in the United States, international research
projects, such as the EU-IST-MATRICE project [2] and the
EU-IST-4MORE project [3] for 4G mobile communication
standardization in the E.U. Although the mobile communi-
cation applications are usually based on cyclic-prefix OFDM
(CP-OFDM) modulation techniques, several encouraging prior
arts have studied several alternatives; e.g., zero-padded OFDM
(ZP-OFDM) [4], [5] and pseudo-random-postfix OFDM (PRP-
OFDM) [6], [7] for the sake of replacing the time-domain
(TD) redundancy by an all-zero sequence or by a specific
training sequence. Several superiorities have been proven to be
accomplished by ZP-OFDM or PRP-OFDM over CP-OFDM
[4]–[7].
Effective CE techniques for coherent OFDM communica-
tion are, in practice, required for the sake of demodulat-
ing received signals, improving detection performance and
tracking time-variant multipath channels. Much research effort
has been made on dealing with various PRP-OFDM CE and
subsequent equalization problems [6]–[9]. However, the afore-
mentioned works [6]–[9] may be limited in wireless local area
network (WLAN) scenarios in which multipath fading and
Doppler effects are not so severe as in mobile communication.
In addition, the previous works [6]–[9] employed a time-
averaging method to substitute statistical expectation opera-
tions and to suppress various kinds of interference, including
inter-block interference (IBI) and inter-symbol interference
(ISI). Unfortunately, these moving-averager-based interference
suppression methods studied in the previous work [6]–[9]
exhibit malfunctions in mobile environment because of rapid
channel variations and real-time requirements. As a matter of
fact, it is difficult to design an effective moving averager for
the previous studies [6]–[9]; because the moving averager not
only must have a sufficiently short time-averaging duration
(i.e., enough wide bandwidth) to both accommodate the time-
variant behaviors of channel tap-weighting coefficients and
to keep the a priori known statistics of PRP unchanged for
effective channel estimation, but also must have a sufficiently
long time-averaging duration (i.e., enough narrow bandwidth)
in order to effectively suppress various kinds of interference
and reduce AWGN.
Recently, previous studies have taken chirp or linearly
frequency modulated (LFM) signals into considerations for
choosing synchronization training sequences [10] in OFDM
systems assisted by Frank codes and other similar sequences
[11]–[13]. Newman phases have also been employed in OFDM
systems and proven suboptimal for reducing peak-to-average
power ratios (PAPR) [14]. In addition, the Zadoff-Chu se-
quence, which is a chirp-like sequence, has been chosen as the
reference sequence on channel estimation in the Third Gener-
ation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)
[15]. Since the dual-chirp signal has many good properties,
which have been shown in previous studies, for the purpose of
training on channel estimation, the proposed technique with a
chirp signal may be applied to mobile PRP-OFDM communi-
cations [16]–[19] with beneficial results; because sufficiently
long PRP sequences are very difficult to find and have not
been searched for in the previous works [6]–[9]. In this paper,
a PRP-OFDM communication system with assistance from a
dual-chirp preamble sequence and a chirp postfix is tested in
mobile environments. Relevant simulation experiments were
conducted for demonstrating the applicability of the chirp
sequence and the improvements obtained using the proposed
technique.

arranged to be [Mp Mp+1 · · · Mq]T sifted from a column
vector M or a row vector with elements arranged to be
[Mp Mp+1 · · · Mq] sifted from a row vector M.
As a matter of fact, rCE,pre,L+v−1[i] can be rewritten in
much detail as follows:
rCE,pre,L+v−1[i] = T[i]h + n
′′[i] = Toh + n
′[i], (6)
where n′′[i] is an (L+ v − 1)× 1 AWGN vector of elements
with the common variance σ2n;
T[i] = (TL[i] + To + TU[i]) ;
To is a Toeplitz matrix with its left-most column
column0 (To) = [c0 c1 · · · cL−1 0 · · · 0]T ;
TU[i] is an Toeplitz inferior triangular matrix with the upper-
most row
row0 (TU[i]) =
[
0 〈xM [i− 1]〉N−1:N−(v−1)
]
;
TL[i] is a Toeplitz superior triangular matrix with the left-most
column
column0 (TL[i]) =
[
01×L 〈xM [i]〉T0:v−2
]T
;
and n′[i] = n′′[i] + TL[i]h + TU[i]h. In the above equation,
TL[i]h inevitably induces inter-symbol interference (ISI) ex-
tended from on-time symbols onto the CE; meanwhile, TU[i]h
inevitably induces inter-block interference (IBI) extended from
preceding symbols onto the CE. According to the LS philos-
ophy, the CE proposed here can, therefore, be formulated as
ĥ0[i] =
(

HTo
)

HrCE,L+v−1[i] (7)
where
rCE,L+v−1[i] =

2
(rCE,post,L+v−1[i− 1] + rCE,post,L+v−1[i]) .
As a matter of fact, the CE performed using rCE,L+v−1[i]
makes the channel estimator, ĥ0[i], derived in (7), effectively
exploit the first-order statistics to conduct the (TD) linear
interpolation (LI) as employed in the previous work [9]. Due to
the LS philosophy, the statistics of n′[i] need not be completely
known prior to performing the CE and

can be pre-calculated and pre-stored as a generic LS CE.
Furthermore, by taking advantage of decision-directed (DD)
self-interference cancellation (SIC), the estimates of CIR can
be iteratively obtained by

with the upper-most row
[

, actu-
ally resulting from the DD symbols. Finally, the estimates of
channel weights on individual subchannels can be obtained by
applying DFT on the ZP replicas of either ĥ0[i] or ĥ1[i]; i.e.,
Ĥk[i] = FN
[
Iv 0v×(N−v)
0(N−v)×v 0(N−v)×(N−v)
]

B. Equalization
For information detection at the receiving end, the ith
information symbol within the DFT (or FFT) window can be
obtained as
rSD,N [i] = 〈rM [i]〉0:N−1 , (10)
and, thus, its corresponding FD symbol is
RSD,0,N [i] = FNrSD,N [i]. (11)
According to the settings in the PRP-OFDM communication
under investigation, the ICI caused by multipath delays can be
compensated for. Thus, the signal symbol for signal detection
can be written as
RSD,1,N [i] = FN (rSD,N [i] + rICIC,N[i]) (12)
where
rICIC,N[i] =
[ 〈rM [i]〉N :N+v−2
0(N−v+1)×1
]
is exploited here for the sake of ICI compensation. In fact,
RSD,1,N [i] in (12) is modified from the method that was called
the overlap-add (OLA) approach in the previous works [5], [8].
Furthermore, the self-interference occurring with the signal
detection can be eliminated; and therefore, the signals fed into
the following detection may then be formulated as
RSD,2,k,N [i] = FN (rSD,N[i] + rICIC,N[i]− r̂prp,k[i]) ,
k = 0, 1,
(13)
where
r̂prp,k[i] = T˜oĥk[i− 1], k = 0, 1
and
T˜o =
〈
T˜′o
〉
(v−1)×v
denotes a matrix sifting most upper-left (v−1)×v components
of the matrix T˜′o that is a circulant matrix with its left-most
column [p0 p1 · · · pL−1]T .
III. SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS
Due to the excellent training properties of the chirp signal,
which have been proven previously, the proposed technique
using the dual-chirp signal can be well applied to PRP-OFDM
communications [16]–[19]. The fundamental requirements of
the mobile environments considered here and the parameters of
the PRP-OFDM communication investigated here are shown
in Table I. The commonly-used tapped-delay-line channel
model was employed in the following simulations. In addition,
the Jakes Rayleigh fader [20] was used to simulate the

IV. CONCLUSIONS
An LS CE technique for PRP-OFDM communications has
been studied in practical mobile environments. The proposed
technique assisted from chirp signals can precisely estimate
CIR and, therefore, can achieve low error probabilities. The
improvements of the proposed technique have been verified
by means of extensive computer simulations.

impulse response (CIR), inter symbol interference (ISI) is 
prevented. However, it is difficult to utilize CP for any other 
tasks, such as channel estimation or synchronization.  
In [9], it provides an idea of utilizing the guard interval for 
processing channel estimation. Our related and previous 
research also adopt this idea to apply in mobile OFDM 
communication systems [10]-[13]. Hence, we hope to 
implement the time-domain channel estimation with PRP-
OFDM in the prefix scheme to obtain better performance in 
rich scattering environments. Related research papers on time-
domain channel estimation in time-varying channels have been 
done in the past [10]-[13]. All of them have employed pseudo 
random sequence to perform time-domain channel estimation 
and carried out simulations for high-mobility environments in 
5GHz band. 
The paper is organized as follows. Descriptions of the 
system structure and channel conditions are briefly reviewed in 
Chapter 2, and whereas the sequence-padding adjustments and 
time-domain channel estimation technique will be given in 
Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, computer simulations of the IEEE 
802.11p communication will be carried out to analyze different 
SNR for ordinary CP-OFDM with pilot channel estimation, as 
well as to compute the error probability of proposed PRP-
OFDM with time-domain channel estimation scheme. The 
simulation conclusion is provided in the end.

“Accident avoidance safety of life” channel is located at 5.8 
GHz Ch. 172, designated for public safety, are investigated in 
this paper. In addition, this scenario is a base station which 
covering area is about 300m (2 or 3 street blocks). Table 1 lists 
the specific parameters for the current IEEE 802.11p. 
For the channel condition, we have referred to 
HIPERLAN/2 [14], the channel parameters of the simulations 
are depicted in Table 2. 
In urban areas, multipath interference is more significant 
than mobility velocity. In this paper, HIPERLAN/2 model B is 
adopted for simulation. In rural areas, LOS often happens. 
HIPERLAN/2 model D is adopted in this paper. The coherence 
bandwidth and coherence time can be evaluated as follows:

Comparing with the pilot organization from IEEE 802.11p 
standard, it can be concluded that IEEE 802.11p specifications 
do not perform well with many multipath signals. In order to 
solve the insufficient of the specifications, [3]-[5] utilize 
midamble to assisted preamble for enhancing the performance. 
The midamble works like half preamble, which is located in the 
stream of data symbols. The packet structure is shown in 
Figure 1. However, the midamble may lower the throughput of 
data transmission. Unlike [3]-[5], therefore, in this paper, a 
channel estimation technique that base on time-domain channel 
estimation will be proposed.

Figure 1 shows the packet structure of transmission blocks. 
Before data symbols begin to transmit, the preamble will be 
processed first. The proposed algorithm will utilize the 
preamble signals for time domain channel estimation. 
Furthermore, the channel estimation method is also using the 
LS algorithm which introduce in previous section. Then, the 
following data symbols will use the CTF which is obtained by 
estimating the preamble for equalizing. 
IV. SIMULATION
Simulation parameters are listed in Table 1 and 2. The 
paper compares the BER performances of the conventional 
CP-OFDM and the proposed technique using different SNR in 
same channel condition. The modulation type is QPSK, packet 
length are two preamble (short preamble and long preamble) 
and 10 or 64 data symbols. The speeds and environments 
tested in the paper are 30 km/h for urban streets and 100km/h 
for rural highways. All simulations will transmit 10000 
packets. 
The channel estimation techniques compared in this paper 
are as follows: 
• TDLSE: using Time domain least-square estimation 
solution to estimate time domain CIR from symbol 
prefix. Then, transform to frequency domain transform 
function and equalizing received symbol. In, addition,  
in equation (1) is 8. 
• TDLSE with FDEQ normalize: using TDLSE. Then, 
normalize all transformation for equalizing received 
symbols. In this simulation, it takes each 5 or 10 CIRs 
from pre and post symbols, on the other hand, when 
data symbol is 64. 
• Preamble TDLSE: using TDLSE to estimate time 
domain CIR from preamble. Then, using this result for 
equalizing all symbols in the same packet.   in equation 
(1) is 36. 
• TDLSE preamble update: combine TDLSE and 
Preamble TDLSE. Using Preamble TDLSE to estimate 
an initial CIR, then, correct the CIR by average post 
and current TDLSE results from each symbol 
recursively. 
The simulation results of urban NLOS rich scattering 
environment are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. From these 
two figures, the influence of different packet length to the 
performance of each technique is depicted. Preamble TDLSE 
suffer from the most impact of the packet length. Because the 
channel is time-varying; longer packet indicates the variation is 
higher. So, the CIR estimates from preamble may not have the 
ability to equalize all symbols. TDLSE preamble update can 
solve this problem and correct the error from TDLSE 
simultaneously. In these two figures, the weakness of pilot 
organization from the standard is also shown. 
Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the results of rural LOS 
environment. While vehicle speed up to 100 km/h, the channel 
varying become faster than 30 km/h. However, in rural 
environment, the LOS signal may make the receiver have 
better recipient. Therefore, in the simulation results, it is 
apparently that Preamble TDLSE couldn’t be satisfied in this 
environment. The major cause comes from the rapid channel 
varying.  Besides, TDLSE preamble update can grab accurate 
CIR and get better performance. 
It is true that TDLSE with FDEQ normalize has much 
better performance than other solutions in these two 
environments; however, it have to buffer enough CIRs for 
normalize process. Not only the memory consumption, will the 
timing delay also happen. Moreover, it is also interesting that 
how many CIRs for normalizing will obtain the balance of 
performance and processing time. 
V. CONCLUSION
The paper has introduced a practical OFDM technique for 
vehicular communication, sequenced OFDM, and has also 
proposed a new channel estimation method for IEEE 802.11p. 
The proposed technique assisted from sequence prefix exhibits 
more perceive estimations of CIR; and therefore can achieve 
low error probabilities. The improvements of the proposed 
technique have been verified by the means of extensive 
computer simulations.

Abstract— A novel estimation technique of timing delay and
frequency offset that takes advantage of a dual-chirp signal is
proposed and investigated in this paper. The proposed tech-
nique can be implemented with low hardware or computational
complexity by using fully-digital circuitry or a digital signal
processor (DSP). In addition, it can achieve sufficiently low
errors both on timing delay and frequency offset estimation
by effectively analyzing only a single burst. Furthermore, the
proposed technique enjoys higher resistance against various kinds
of interference than conventional techniques. Its superiority is

I. INTRODUCTION
Timing synchronization and frequency offset compensa-
tion are the most important for any wireless communication
applications. Very often, pseudo-noise (PN) sequences are
employed as training preambles for the purpose of timing
synchronization in a variety of wireless transmission systems
[1], [2]. Although PN sequences can provide high-resolution
timing synchronization based on their good correlation prop-
erties by taking advantage of PN matched filtering (PN MF),
they unfortunately cannot be applied to estimation or com-
pensation of frequency offset [3], [4]. In addition, the cross-
correlation between the received signal and a locally-generated
PN sequence may be significantly destroyed due to phase
rotations within the correlation/accumulation period in the PN
MF in which a high frequency offset exists [3]. In order to
take care of an initial frequency offset, continuous wave (CW)
signals are often applied in conjunction with the PN training
preamble. In a typical arrangement, a receiver can first analyze
a CW signal to accurately estimate the frequency offset, and
then compensate the frequency offset for the subsequent PN
correlation process. However, such a conventional approach
not only increases the number of preambles required by
the synchronization sub-systems, but also sacrifices system
performance and robustness against interference because the
CW signal is vulnerable to any forms of interference. The
conventional method also requires significant hardware com-
plexity because the CW frequency offset estimation method
cannot be easily performed in discrete-time form on a digital
signal processor (DSP), as discussed in recent research studies
[5].
A particular synchronization burst, called dual-chirp signal,
was originally addressed in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)
Mobile Radio (GMR) mobile-satellite communications [6],
[7]. The dual-chirp signal, which can be thought of as a
spread spectrum (SS) waveform, can actually offer significant
processing gain to combat various kinds of interference [8].
Moreover, it enables a joint estimation of timing and frequency
errors. In fact, chirp signals have been commonly used in
radar applications, such as pulse compression radar [8], [9]. In
practice, joint estimation of timing delay and frequency offset
using dual chirp in the GMR mobile-satellite communications
were previously presented [10], [11]. However, the main points
in [10], [11] are limited in the applicability, reducibility and
implementation. Both of the time-domain (TD) and frequency-
domain (FD) estimators proposed in the previous works [10],
[11] jointly estimate the timing delay and frequency offset
simultaneously with reduced complexity at the cost of degra-
dation of the estimates. In other words, the TD estimator
proposed in the previous works [10], [11] can accurately
estimate the timing delay but can only approximately estimate
the frequency offset, meanwhile the FD estimator can accu-
rately estimate the frequency offset but can only approximately
estimate the timing delay. Joint estimation simply sacrifices
estimation accuracy for reducing computational complexity.
In addition, performance evaluations were completely skipped
in the previous works [10], [11].
II. SIGNAL MODEL AND SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

der investigation in this paper for estimation of timing and
frequency errors can be formulated as

As a result, the timing delay of the dual-chirp burst can be
estimated using
τˆ =
tˆu + tˆd
2
− T. (11)
In fact, if the term 1 − |t′| occurring in (9) was ignored,
both equations would be in the form of the sinc function and
have peaks when their arguments equal zero. In other words,
the peaks occur around t′ = −ǫ′ for |yu,u (t′)| and around
t′ = ǫ′ for |yd,d (t′)|. The peak magnitude of |yu,u (t′)| is
shifted away from the right instant, t′ = 0, by roughly −ǫ′;
meanwhile the peak magnitude of |yu,u (t′)| is shifted away
from the right instant, t′ = 0, by roughly ǫ′. Finally, the middle
of tˆu and tˆd represents the right instant. In the special case
where no frequency offset exists, i.e., ǫ′ = 0, |yu,u (t′)| and
|yd,d (t′)| completely overlap with each other; and the right
instant occurs at their common peak.
B. Interference Components
After some algebraic manipulation, the magnitudes of the
crosstalk terms, yu,d(t) and yd,u(t), can be rewritten as
|yu,d (t′)| = |yd,u (t′)|
=
√
ET
8D
{
[C (κ1)− C (κ0)]2 + [S (κ1)− S (κ0)]2
} 1
2
,
−1 ≤ t′ ≤ 1
(12)
where
κ0 =
√
D [−1 + |t′| − ǫ′] ,
κ1 =
√
D [1− |t′| − ǫ′] ,
C(κ) =
∫ κ

2
α2
)
dα,
S(κ) =
∫ κ
0
sin
(π
2
α2
)
dα.
In the above, C (κ) and S (κ) are the Fresnel integrals [12].
From (12), it can be shown that
|yu,d (t′)| = |yd,u (t′)| ≤ 1√

4 [1− |t′|] 12 , |t′| ≤ 1.
(13)
Therefore, the power ratio of the peak cross-talk and the
peak desired components, which may be interpreted as the
reciprocal of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), can be obtained
from
max
{
|yd,u (t′)|2
}
max
{
|yu,u (t′)|2
} ≤ 1− |t′|
2
√
D
, |t′| ≤ 1, (14)
which approaches to zero as D goes to infinity. This confirms
that the cross-talk effects are negligible while D is sufficiently
large.
C. Frequency Offset Estimation
Let us carefully consider the two signals shown below:
zu(t) = r(t) · 1√
T
s∗u (t− τˆ) = zu,u(t) + zu,d(t) + n′u(t)
zd(t) = r(t) · 1√
T
s∗d (t− τˆ) = zd,u(t) + zd,d(t) + n′d(t),
(15)
where τˆ denotes the estimate of the timing delay τ , and can
be obtained from the timing estimate in (11); and
zp,q(t) =
1√
T
s∗p (t− τˆ) ·
√
ET
2T
sq(t− τ)ej(2πǫt+θ),
n′p(t) =
1√
T
s∗p (t− τˆ) · n(t), p, q ∈ {u, d}
The Fourier transforms of zu(t) and zd(t) can be written as
Zu (f) = Zu,u (f) + Zu,d (f) +Nu (f) ,
Zd (f) = Zd,u (f) + Zd,d (f) +Nd (f) .
(16)
After some algebraic manipulation, the magnitudes of the
signal components in (16) can be derived to be
|Zu,u (f)|
=
√
ET
2
(
1− τe
T
) ∣∣∣∣∣sinc
{[
f − ǫ− µτe
][
|τe| − T
]}∣∣∣∣∣;
|Zd,d (f)|
=
√
ET
2
(
1− τe
T
) ∣∣∣∣∣sinc
{[
f − ǫ+ µτe
][
|τe| − T
]}∣∣∣∣∣,
|τe| < T,
(17)
where τe = τ − τˆ denotes the error in the aforementioned
timing delay estimate. Examples of the magnitudes of the
signal components have been simulated and plotted in Fig. 3.
Since the term (|τe| − T ) in (17) is independent of f , it cannot

stands for “least-squares interpolation”. Since the waveforms
or correlations in the TD or in the FD cannot always be
sampled on the peaks, the 3-point least-squares interpolation
method was used for finding the true peaks in order to reduce
power loss and to improve the accuracy.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The estimation of timing delay and frequency offset using
a dual-chirp sequence has been thoroughly investigated. The
proposed technique can simultaneously achieve low errors
in timing delay and frequency offset estimates by analyzing
only a single burst. In addition, this technique exhibits better
robustness with respect to various kinds of interference, and
it can be digitally implemented on a DSP. The superiority has
been verified through both simulations and statistical analysis.

會議名稱 ICC 2010 - IEEE International Conference on Communications 
發表論文題目 Field Test and Performance Improvement in IEEE 802.11p 
V2R/R2V Environments 
報告內容包括下列各項：(e-mail 至本校國際事務處 yupin@ncu.edu.tw，俾利上
網刊載） 
一、參加會議經過 
 
本次會議於南非開普敦舉行，因為世界盃足球賽也即將於南非舉辦，因此南
非相當多的建設都是非常新穎而且具有現代感的。但是晚上治安仍然不好，因此
會議後，幾乎所有人都會到有較多警察巡邏的維多利亞港吃飯。 
 
二、與會心得 
會議現場無線網路服務相當不堪，本人在前往南非前在台北參加了
VTC-spring。該會由中華電信支援無線網路服務，在每個會議點都架設了無線網
路服務。而 ICC 卻是全場只有 250 個 ip，由與會的 1700 多人共用，因此有大半
時間無線網路服務是無法使用的。 
 
本人報告過程順利，因為報告主題是一個還在草稿階段的車間通訊 802.11p
規格，因為加上少見的量測及認證規劃內容，因此引起與會人員的興趣。因為本
規格有其天生限制及使用上的要求，所以限制了很多複雜技術應用到上面的可能
性。但在與會人士的建議之下，我們也發現行動通訊幾項熱門研究主題其實與我
們的研究有相當大的關聯。（牽涉本報告為公開資料，不予以詳細討論）並且可
以與目前熱門的感知無線電、Relay Network、Green IT communication 研究方向
結合。 
 
近年中國大陸的研討會投稿量有大幅度的增加，但是也發現一件有趣的現
象，這些錄取者繳了註冊費之後讓文章進入 IEEE 資料庫，卻不參加研討會。而
五、攜回資料名稱及內容

二、與會心得 
本會議為一個小而精巧的會議，與 ICC 相比，這個會議參加人數大約
只有 ICC 的四分之一，但是研究領域比 ICC 更為專精。同時在簡報要求上
也更加嚴格。本人報告過程相當順利，報告會場座無虛席，報告主題是 IEEE 
802.11p 規格的效能提昇方法，因此引起與會人員的興趣。而主席也順應問
問題人數坐了報告時間的調整，讓我的時間多延長了幾分鐘。 
可以發現，車間通訊這個研究領域仍然在起步並且慢慢發酵為熱門研究
項目。報告人員有車廠代表、電信業者、研究單位。是值得投資的研究項目。
但本人所發表的題目過於偏向設備製作，因此有些與會者無法感覺我們這個
研究方向的關鍵為何。這一點值得作記錄，以便未來出國製作投影片時的重
要參考。
