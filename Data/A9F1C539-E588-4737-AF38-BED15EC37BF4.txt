In this paper, the problem of an inﬁnite sequence of parallel cracks in an inﬁnite extended piezoelectric
solid is analyzed. A system of singular integral equations is formulated for general anisotropic piezoelec-
tric materials, of which the kernel functions developed are in complex form. For commonly used trans-
versely isotropic piezoelectric materials, the kernel functions are given in real forms. Furthermore, the
obtained real kernel functions may be reduced, respectively, to those kernel functions for purely elastic
and purely electric problems when the coupled mechanical and electric effects disappear. The system of
singular integral equations is solved numerically and the coupling effects of the mechanical and electric
phenomena are presented by the generalized stress intensity factors.

1. Introduction
In recent years the wide use of the electromechanical and elec-
tronic devices, such as ultrasonic generators, sensors, underwater
acoustic, transducers and actuators has promoted the investiga-
tions of the piezoelectric materials to improve the understanding
of the intrinsic coupling effect between mechanical and electrical
ﬁeld. In these devices, both electrical and mechanical loads applied
on the piezoelectric components will give rise to sufﬁciently high
stresses that can lead to their failure. To understand their fracture
behaviors, many researchers have performed the analyses of piezo-
electric materials with defects (e.g., cracks, holes, inclusions, etc.).
For example, earlier works related to one defect were done by
Chung and Ting [2], Lu and Williams [15], Gao and Fan [4], Park
and Sun [17,18], Sosa [20], Pak [16], etc., just mention a few. Elec-
tronic devices are sometimes operated at severe environments
such as high temperature and high moisture. Under these severe
environments the device will deteriorate in a complicated manner
such as the observations of many undesirable micro-cracks devel-
oped. To ensure the integrity of the device, the understanding of
interactions of the multiple cracks becomes important. Recently
investigations on multiple defects have also been received much
attention. For example, problems with ﬁnite collinear cracks have
been studied, respectively, by Gao and Fan [3] for transversely iso-
tropic piezoelectric materials and by Hao [9] for general aniso-
tropic materials. Periodic collinear cracks extended inﬁnitely
have been investigated by Gao and Wang [5] and later on by Hao
[10] with further elaborations on the effects of the permittivity
of air contained in the cracks. Using different approaches, the inter-
actions of multiple cracks in piezoelectric materials are analyzed,
respectively, by Han and Wang [8] and Han and Chen [7].
In this paper, a sequence of parallel cracks (see 1) embedded in
a piezoelectric solid under pressure, in-plane shear, anti-plane
shear and electric displacement loadings is considered. Following
the investigations suggested by Wang and Mai [28] and Ueda
[26], the boundary conditions on the crack faces are assumed to
be electric impermeable in our analysis. Based upon the general-
ized Stroh formalism, a system of singular integral equations with
the unknown generalized dislocation densities deﬁned on the
crack faces is developed to evaluate the mechanical and electric
coupling effects on the generalized stress intensity factors. The ker-
nel functions of the singular integral equations, valid for general
anisotropic piezoelectric materials, are expressed in terms of inﬁ-
nite sums of certain combinations of polynomial functions. Kernel
functions are in general in complex form since the complex-valued
matrix B, deﬁned in the context, is contained in the kernel func-
tions. Employing the results developed by Liou and Sung [12]
who express the elements of the matrix B in terms of the elastic
stiffness explicitly for piezoelectric materials, then a real form of
the kernel functions for monoclinic materials may be obtained.
For simplicity only the explicit results for transversely isotropic
piezoelectric materials are given. The obtained explicit real kernel
functions for transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials show
the mode II (III) elastic deformation is totally decoupled from both
the mode I elastic deformation and the mode for electric ﬁeld. Two
different types of materials may be classiﬁed for transversely pie-
zoelectric materials [23]. For type I material, we may show that the

at point xD ¼ ðxD1 ; xD2 Þ in a crack-free piezoelectric inﬁnite solid. The
corresponding complex generalized stress functions in a crack-free
piezoelectric inﬁnite solid have been given by Ting [25] and Liu
et al. [13] and the results are

where
zDa ¼ xD1 þ paxD2 ða ¼ 1;2;3;4Þ: ð3:2Þ
With the generalized stress functions determined above, the gener-
alized traction at any pint on a plane curve with outward unit nor-
mal vector m may be evaluated by
tv ¼ ouos ; ð3:3Þ
where s is the arc length measured along the curve. Now suppose
there are generalized dislocations with densities b*(t) distributed
over the crack faces, then by summing up the generalized tractions
induced by these generalized dislocations on the crack faces, a rep-
resentation equation for the total generalized tractions on the crack
faces is obtained. For the present problem, the total generalized
tractions on the crack faces are known a prior, therefore, a system
of singular integral equations is obtained instead. To develop these
equations, we ﬁrst express variables za and zDa on the crack faces in
terms of the new variables n and t, respectively, as
za ¼ n; j n j6 c; ð3:4Þ
zDa ¼ t þ paNd; jtj 6 c ða ¼ 1;2;3;4Þ; ð3:5Þ
where N = 0,±1,±2, . . . Thus, the complex generalized stress function
corresponding to a periodic array of dislocations each situated a dis-
tance d apart in a piezoelectric inﬁnite solid is

With this generalized stress function and then employing the pro-

as [25]

Note that the term corresponding to N = 0 is the singular part of the
kernel function K(n, t) and the rest terms with N 6¼ 0 are all regular
terms. For single values of generalized displacements around a

The coupled singular integral equations for the generalized disloca-
tion densities in Eq. (3.7) combined with Eq. (3.10) can be solved
numerically. Once the generalized dislocation densities have been
found, the generalized stress intensity factors at the crack tips,
i.e., the three stress intensity factors kI, kII, kIII and the electric dis-
placement intensity factor kD, can be extracted directly, for example
for the crack tip at n = c, by [21]

It is noted that for general anisotropic piezoelectric materials the
determination of the generalized dislocation density e(t) involves
the evaluation of the matrix B, since matrix B appears in the kernel
functions as shown in Eq. (3.9). The effects of the piezoelectric
material properties on the kernel functions are mostly contained
in the matrix B, therefore it is of interest to express matrix B explic-
itly in terms of material constants. For monoclinic piezoelectric
materials, matrix B has been expressed explicitly in terms of mate-
rial constants by Liou and Sung [12]. Therefore with their results,
the kernel functions originally expressed in complex form for gen-
eral anisotropic piezoelectric materials may then be expressed in
real form for monoclinic piezoelectric materials. In the next section,
however, only the results for transversely isotropic piezoelectric
materials mostly used in applications are presented.
4. Explicit real kernel functions
As mentioned in previous section, the kernel functions for gen-
eral anisotropic piezoelectric materials are in general in complex
form. To develop the kernel functions in real forms, explicit expres-
sion of matrix B is needed which has been constructed by Liou and
Sung [12] for monoclinic piezoelectric materials. Therefore the ker-
nel functions may be worked out for monoclinic piezoelectric
materials, however, we will present in the following only the
results of the real kernel functions for transversely isotropic piezo-
electric materials. For transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials
with the x2-axis parallel to the poling direction, the constitutive
equation (Eq. (2.1)) is expressed as

and using the identities h2 ¼ h1 (Eq. (A.1)) and Im{h3} = 0 (Eq. (A.2))

and Kab are shown in the Appendix C. For type II materials, the ker-
nel functions expressed above are in series forms. No compact func-
tions are found to represent these series. In numerical computations
these inﬁnite terms have to be truncated. Our numerical computa-
tions to be discussed in the next section show that satisfactorily
results can always be obtained for these kernel functions. The
vanishings of the kernel functions K12 = K13 = K14 = K21 = K23 = K31 =
K32 = K34 = 0 and K41 = K42 = 0 show that the phenomena of mode
II and mode III mechanical deformations decoupled from both the
mode I mechanical deformation and the electric response observed
for type I materials are also existed for type II materials.
4.3. Kernel functions for decoupling problems
When the mechanical and electric coupling effect vanishes, the
original coupled problem will be reduced to two separated purely
anisotropic elasticity and electric problems. By letting the piezo-
electric-stress constants ekij be zero, we see that parameters ha
(a = 1,2,3) deﬁned in Appendix A all vanish. Therefore matrix B de-
ﬁned in Eq. (4.5) becomes

trix B in Eq. (4.17), the kernel functions for mechanical and electric
decoupled problem become, for type I,

pear as the crack spacing approaches to inﬁnity, i.e.,
kIII ! 0 as d=ð2cÞ ! 1. The intrigued coupled phenomenon is also
observed for kD, as can be seen in Fig. 2c. Similar behaviors ob-
served for kIII and k

D induced by mode I loading are not surprising
since it is reasonable to conjecture that both behaviors, when
decoupled from the mode I, are essentially governed by the type
of Laplace equation. To our knowledge, the above intrigued cou-
pled phenomenon of mechanical interaction between mode I and
mode III has never been reported in the literature. However, in
the analysis of magnetoelectroelastic materials, similar behavior
of kD has also been observed by Wang and Han [27].
5.1.2. Uniform in-plane shear loading
The results when crack faces are subjected to uniform in-plane
shear loading are presented in Figs. 3a–3c. No results are plotted
for kI since there will be no response for mode I deformation when
in-plane shear loading is acting. Results presented in Fig. 3a are the
mechanical responses of kII which show that all are monotonically
decreasing functions of d/(2c). The mechanical behavior for mode
III, existed only for the left-hand quartz in a rotated coordinate sys-
tem with diad jjx2, is shown in Fig. 3b. Note that the behavior of kIII
is also a monotonically decreasing function as the crack spacing in-

versa. However, the coupling effect between mode II and mode III
behaves in a different way. It is observed from Fig. 4b that kII
(non-monotonic) behaves more or less like that of kI (Fig. 4a) when
anti-plane loading is applied. However, kIII (Fig. 3b) is a monoton-
ically decreasing function when in-plane shear loading is applied
as discussed above. As to the behavior for kIII, Fig. 4c shows that
kIII induced by itself loading is a monotonic function of d/(2c).
5.1.4. Electric displacement loading
The results of crack faces under uniform electric displacement
loading are presented in Figs. 5a–5c. No presentations are made
for kIII since anti-plane and electric responses are decoupled for
these three materials, i.e., kIII ¼ 0 when electric displacement load-
ing is applied. Note that the effects of electric displacement loading
on the behaviors of kI and k

II are similar to those of anti-plane
loading on kI and k

II. It is also observed that mechanical response
of kI and k

II induced by the applied electric displacement loading
is not signiﬁcant.

paring the coupled and decoupled results from these tables, it does
reveal that the coupled results are all slightly different from those
for decoupled problem. For comparisons, results for purely isotro-
pic elastic problems are also presented in these Tables. The accu-
racy of the present isotropic elastic responses has been validated
with the work of Yokobori and Ichikawa [32] for in-plane problems
and with the work of Smith [19] for anti-plane problem.
6. Conclusion
The problem of an inﬁnite sequence of parallel cracks in an inﬁ-
nite extended piezoelectric solid is analyzed. A system of singular
integral equations valid for general anisotropic piezoelectric mate-
rials is developed. Explicit real kernel functions are given for com-
monly used transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials.
Furthermore, when the coupled mechanical and electric effects
disappear, these real kernel functions may be reduced, respec-
tively, to those kernel functions for purely elastic and purely elec-
tric problems and both will recover those kernel functions
corresponding to isotropic materials. The system of singular inte-
gral equations is solved numerically and the coupling effects of
the mechanical and electric phenomena are presented by the gen-
eralized stress intensity factors. Some interesting coupling effects
observed for monoclinic materials are discussed and attention is
also given to the effects of the spacing of the cracks on the general-
ized stress intensity factors.
