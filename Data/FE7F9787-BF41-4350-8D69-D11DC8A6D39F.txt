Abstract 
With the extensive usage of Computer 
Graphics Software and the advent of World 
Wide Web technologies, many designers 
have participated in web-based learning 
community of Computer Graphics Software 
to share their knowledge. However, current 
learning communities are limited to their 
inflexible user interface. They do not take 
into account the differences in user cognitive 
styles and behavior patterns. This limitation 
hampers many users in taking advantage of 
these forums due to inconvenience of use. 
Therefore, the objective of this research is to 
study the design of adaptive user interfaces 
for this kind of learning community based 
on cognitive styles and behavior patterns. 
This research includes two parts. The 
first part studies appropriate web pages for 
people with different cognitive styles. The 
second part constructs a recommendation 
system of the training files for learning 
Computer Graphics software based on the 
characteristics and usage behavior patterns 
of learners.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Adaptive Web Pages based on 
Cognitive Styles 
1.1.1. Background and motivation 
In face of the competitive work environment and the 
more and more advanced Internet technology, many 
designers have started acquire knowledge about using 
computer graphics software through online forums in 
recent years. However, as most of the online forums 
are not adaptive, inconvenience in using and learning 
 4
were originally made. Unlike trail files, training files 
contain the extension “.txa.” A training file contains 
directives that guide a learner through a sample 
exercise or operation in Pro/ENGINEER. When a 
learner runs a training file, the textual comments in 
these directives are displayed in an information 
window. 
1.2.2. Research objective 
Although training files are useful for self-learning, 
selecting appropriate training files that are suitable 
for a learner with specific knowledge and skill levels 
is still a difficult task. Therefore, in order to facilitate 
self-learning, the objective of this research is to 
develop a personalized recommendation system for 
the training files of a feature-based design system. 
1.2.3. Literature review 
In the e-learning environment, it is important to 
provide a personalized recommendation system that 
can adaptively recommend teaching materials 
according to the interests and levels of learners 
(Zaïane, 2002; Lu, 2004; Chao et al., 2005). There 
are two types of technologies used in 
recommendation systems: content-based filtering and 
collaborative filtering (Wang and Shao, 2004). 
Content-based filtering is based on content analysis of 
the considered objects, e.g. term frequency for text 
documents, and its relation to the user’s preferences. 
A content-based system, in general, analyzes a set of 
documents rated by an individual user and uses the 
content of these documents, as well as the provided 
ratings, to infer a profile that can be used to 
recommend additional items of interest. MLTutor 
(Smith and Blandford, 2003) and WALTZ2U (Chao 
et al., 2005) are educational systems that applied 
content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering 
techniques, match people with similar interests and 
then recommend one person’s highly evaluated items 
to the others. In collaborative filtering objects are 
selected for a particular user, which are relevant to 
similar users. The content of the objects is ignored 
and only other user’s opinions on the considered 
objects are relevant. An educational example of 
collaborative filtering can be found in WebCOBALT 
(Mitsuhara et al., 2002). Collaborative filtering is 
independent to the content. However, the 
performance of it relies on the amount of available 
opinions on the considered objects and it therefore 
fails when few or no opinions are known. In the 
contrary, content-based approach is less sensitive to 
sparsity of ratings. However, users can receive only 
recommendations similar to their earlier experiences 
through content-based filtering. In order to take the 
advantages and overcome the problems, this research 
employs a hybrid approach. 
 
 
2. RESULTS OF THE ADAPTIVE 
FORUM BASED ON COGNITIVE 
STYLES 
2.1. Component Factors of Webpage 
Layouts 
The objective of this stage is to investigate the 
difference in component factors of online forum web 
layouts. Besides, the experimental equipment 
employed in this research includes a 15-inch monitor 
and a desktop PC. The display resolution is set at 
1024x768, and the subjects are 30 professionals with 
a background in design and students from 
departments of design in colleges or graduate 
institutes. 
In the experiment of this stage, 10 component 
factors of web layouts are selected, and 10 
domestic/foreign online forums are collected. The 
subjects are then invited to make a subjective 
evaluation of the 10 forums on the 10 component 
factors. Besides, as to the experimental procedure, 
subjects are required to connect to the experimental 
website and search for the answers to the 
experimental tasks. At last, they make an evaluation 
of preferences for the experimental website. There are 
two experimental tasks in this stage, including 
searching for the poster of a specific article and the 
member with the most post counts. These tasks are 
intended to make the subjects browse the entire 
webpage. At last, based on the literature review and 
the current online forums, a questionnaire is designed. 
The content of the questionnaire can be divided into 
two sections. The first section is the basic data of the 
subject, including age, gender, experience of using 
online forums, and time spent on online forums. The 
second section is the subjective preference for 
existing online forums. At the end of this section, 
subjects are allowed to express their opinions, 
suggestions, and expectations for online forums. 
The evaluation criterion of this stage is the 
subjective preference for the experimental website. 
The evaluation items are 10 component factors of 
web layouts, and Likert Scale is adopted to provide 7 
levels (1-7) of preference for selection. Further, 
2-way ANOVA and SPSS statistic analysis software 
are adopted to analyze the experimental results. 
Based on the experimental results, subjects had 
bipolar opinions on the satisfactions with white space, 
page division, contrast between foreground and 
background, and color on existing online forums. On 
the existing online forums, significant differences 
existed among the 4 components factors, including 
white space, page division, contrast between 
foreground and background, and color. In the aspect 
of white space, the difference in the proportion of 
white space columns was the largest. In the aspect of 
page division, the difference in the location of basic 
data and utilization of color blocks is the largest. In 
the aspect of foreground and background contrast, the

3. RESULT OF THE TRAINING FILE 
RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 
3.1. Content-based Filtering 
There are several types of representation models for 
content-based filtering. This research employs the 
vector space model (Salton, 1989) to represent 
trailing files and learner profiles. The degree of 
similarity between a training file and a learner is then 
calculated using the cosine measure.  
3.1.1. Training file model 
In the vector model, a training file i is represented as 
a t-dimensional vector, where each dimension 
corresponds to a distinct term T and t is the total 
number of indexed terms used in the collection of 
training files. These terms represent the design 
features used to construct a 3D product model. 
Therefore, the vector for a file i is represented by Fi = 
(wi1, wi2, …, wit). The weight wij of a term Tj in a 
training file Fi is defined as the term frequency (tf) 
multiplied by the inverse document frequency (idf): 
j
ijij df
ntfw log⋅=                                     
, where  tf is the number of occurrences of term Tj in 
file Fi; n is the total number of training files in the 
recommendation system; dfj is the number of files in 
which term Tj appears at least once. The assumptions 
behind tf-idf scheme are based on two characteristics 
of text files. First, the more times a term appears in a 
file, the more relevant it is to the topic of the file. 
Second, the more times a term occurs in all files in 
the system, the more poorly it discriminates between 
files.  
3.1.2. Learner profile 
The profile of a learner u is represented by Lu = (lu1, 
lu2, …, lut). The entry luj of an indexed term Tj for lu is 
provided by the learner to indicate the degree of 
importance for the design feature he or she is 
currently learning.  
3.1.3. Similarity measurement 
Since a file and a learner profile are represented as 
t-dimensional vectors. The similarity can be 
quantified by the cosine of the angle between these 
two vectors as:

prediction of rating, each similarity value is 
multiplied by a scaling factor, ks, which is the 
maximal value of the rating scale.

con =   
                                                     
3.2. Collaborative Filtering 
3.2.1. Learner profile and similarity measure 
There are several types of approaches to collaborative 
filtering. This research employs the person-to-person 
correlation approach. The task of a collaborative 
filtering system is to predict the usefulness rating of a 
particular learner u for a training file i. Therefore, the 
rating vector of a learner u is represented by Ru = (ru1, 
ru2, …, rui). The entry ruj of Ru is provided by the 
learner to indicate the degree of usefulness for the file 
he or she is currently used in learning specific topics. 
The system compares the user’s ratings with the 
ratings of all other users, who have rated the 
considered file. Then a weighted average of the other 
learners rating is used as a prediction. If Iu is set of 
 8
experiences, of the learner. Secondly, the training 
files can be grouped into several categories based on 
their applications, such as product models for 
consumer electronics or vehicles. Thirdly, the history 
of viewing the training files can serve as additional 
information in learner profiles. These suggestions will 
be considered as the features of the system in next 
version. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
In the first study, the analysis indicated that users with 
field independence preferred the placement of basic 
data on the left, joined published articles with the use 
of different color blocks, while users of field 
dependence preferred the placement of basic data on 
the left, un-joined published articles, and the use of 
same color blocks. 
In the second study, by taking the advantages of 
content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, the 
developer of this system employed a hybrid approach. 
The representation models, the algorithms and the 
prototype of a recommendation system were 
constructed. The result showed that learners can 
obtain appropriate training files effectively.

ABSTRACT 
Training files are important for self-learning while using a feature-based design system. However, selecting appropriate 
training files that are suitable for a learner with specific knowledge and skill levels is a difficult task. Therefore, in order 
to facilitate self-learning, the objective of this research is to develop a personalized recommendation system for the 
training files of a feature-based design system. The authors employ content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to 
construct the system. In content-based filtering, a vector-based representation scheme is used to model the training file 
and learner profile. The keywords for searching training files are recorded in the database with their important ratings. 
The similarity is then quantified by the cosine of the angle between these two vectors and converted into the prediction of 
rating. In collaborative filtering, usefulness ratings for files are provided by the learners and recorded in the database. 
These ratings are used to predict the ratings for new items for specific learners. The predicted rating of each file is then 
calculated by combining the results from content-based and collaborative filtering linearly. Based on the predicted rating, 
training files that are useful to a learner are retrieved and listed in a descending order in the user interface of this system. 
The result shows that learners can obtain appropriate training files effectively.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In a feature-based design system, design engineers construct 3D product models step by step using different 
types of design features, such as protrusions, holes, surfaces, etc. Therefore, learning how to manipulate these 
features with effectiveness and efficiency is important for model construction. In order to become 
professional design engineers, people have to go through extensive training courses continuing for several 
months.  
Instead of taking formal training courses, people can benefit from the training files provided by 
instruction institutes or experienced designers. For example, in Pro/ENGINEER, a commercial 3D modeling 
system, training files are customized trail files that can be used to help train users. A trail file is a record of all 
menu choices, dialog-box choices, selections, and keyboard entries for a particular working session. Trail 
files allow a user to view the record of activity so that a user can reconstruct a previous working session or to 
recover from an abrupt termination of a session. Trail files are editable text (.txt) files. When a user run a trail 
file, the system replays the selections in the exact order in which they were originally made. Unlike trail files, 
training files contain the extension “.txa.” A training file contains directives that guide a learner through a 
sample exercise or operation in Pro/ENGINEER. When a learner runs a training file, the textual comments in 
these directives are displayed in an information window. 
Although training files are useful for self-learning, selecting appropriate training files that are suitable for 
a learner with specific knowledge and skill levels is still a difficult task. Therefore, in order to facilitate self-

The profile of a learner u is represented by Lu = (lu1, lu2, …, lut). The entry luj of an indexed term Tj for lu is 
provided by the learner to indicate the degree of importance for the design feature he or she is currently 
learning.  
3.1.3 Similarity measurement

3.2 Collaborative filtering 
3.2.1 Learner profile and similarity measure 
There are several types of approaches to collaborative filtering. This research employs the person-to-person 
correlation approach. The task of a collaborative filtering system is to predict the usefulness rating of a 
particular learner u for a training file i. Therefore, the rating vector of a learner u is represented by Ru = (ru1, 
ru2, …, rui). The entry ruj of Ru is provided by the learner to indicate the degree of usefulness for the file he or 
she is currently used in learning specific topics. The system compares the user’s ratings with the ratings of all 
other users, who have rated the considered file. Then a weighted average of the other learners rating is used 
as a prediction. If Iu is set of files that a learner u has rated then we can define the mean rating of learner u as:  
∑
∈
=
uIi
ui
u
u rI
r 1                            
When Pearson correlation is used, similarity is determined from the correlation of the rating vectors of 
learner u and the other learner u’. This value measures the similarity between the two users’ rating vectors.
