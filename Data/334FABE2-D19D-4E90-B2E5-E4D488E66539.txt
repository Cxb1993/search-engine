reaction, the profiles of pH and oxidation reduction 
potential (ORP) were monitoring and recorded on-line 
and the results of H2O2, total organic carbon (TOC) 
and concentration of ethylenediamine were measured. 
Experimental results indicated that 34.6% of 
ethylenediamine was degraded coupled with 33.2% 
mineralization within the reaction time of 60 min at 
pH 3.0, 25℃, H2O2 of 1 mg/min and Fe2+ of 5 mg/L in 
sono-Fenton system. Comparing with the sole 
ultrasound (17% of ethylenediamine degradation 
coupled with 17.3% mineralization) or Fenton process 
(20% of ethylenediamine degradation coupled with 
18.3% mineralization), it was found that the 
combination of ultrasound and Fenton process, namely 
sono-Fenton process, showed the better degradation 
efficiency for ethylenediamine. In addition, 
increasing the dosage of H2O2 from 1 to 4 mg/min led 
to the increase in ethylenediamine degradation from 
46.6% to as high as 61.0%. When the Fe2+ dosage was 
increased from 5 mg/L to 20 mg/L, degradation of 
ethylenediamine increased from 34.6% to 49.2% (H2O2 2 
mg/min). As the Fe2+ was increased to as high as 40 
mg/L, degradation of ethylenediamine significantly 
decreased to 30.9%, which indicated that additional 
dosage of Fe2+ was worthless in the enhancement of 
ethylenediamine degradation. Experimental results 
also pointed out the lower reaction pH and 
ethylenedimaine concentration were profitable to the 
degradation of ethylenediamine by sono-Fenton 
process. Based on the results shown in this study, 
the optimal dosage of H2O2 and Fe2+ should be 4 
mg/min and 20 mg/L. At this condition, 61.0% of 
ethylenediamine is degraded coupled with 53.5% 
mineralization； in addition, this result is much 
better than our previous finding (batch mode sono-
Fenton process for 120 min reaction could get 40% 
ethylenediamine degradation and 13% mineralization).

1中文摘要
有機剝膜液所含之乙二胺為半導體製程中主要的有機汙染廢水來源，不易被生物分解，
故不利於傳統生物處理，因此，本研究針對不同 pH 及 H2O2、Fe2+的添加量以及初始乙二胺
濃度等因子，探討乙二胺之分解效率及其礦化率之變化。反應過程中取得之水樣分別對 pH、
氧化還原電位 (oxidation reduction potential, ORP)、H2O2、總有機碳 (total organic carbon, TOC) 
及乙二胺的濃度進行測定。實驗結果顯示，當實驗條件設定於 pH 3.0、25℃，H2O2 為 1 
mg/min 及 Fe2+ 5 mg/L 時，反應 60 分鐘後，連續式 sono-Fenton 程序可分解 34.6% 之乙
二胺 (初始濃度為 100 mg/L)，礦化率為 33.2%；若與 Fenton 程序及單純超音波程序比較，
Fenton 程序對於乙二胺之去除率僅為 20%，礦化率為 18.3%，超音波程序則為 17%及 17.3%。
此外，H2O2 加入量的提高對於提升乙二胺的分解效率具有正面之效益，當加入量由 1 
mg/min 提高至 4 mg/min 時，乙二胺之去除率由 46.6% 提高至 61.0%，而當 Fe2+ 由 5 
mg/L 增加到 20 mg/L 時，乙二胺之去除率由 34.6% 提高至 49.2% (H2O2 2 mg/min)，但若
Fe2+ 增加至 40 mg/L 時，乙二胺之去除率反而降低至 30.9%，顯示過量之 Fe2+ 對於提升
乙二胺去除率並無幫助。而在初始 pH 及乙二胺濃度不同時，較低之 pH 及初始乙二胺濃度
對於乙二胺之去除較為合宜。根據實驗不同的參數結果得知，最佳的 H2O2 及 Fe2+ 的加藥量
分別為 4 mg/min 及 20 mg/L，同時，若與本研究群以往之研究結果相比 (批次式 sono-Fenton 
程序反應 120 min，乙二胺之去除率 40%，礦化率 13%)，連續式 sono-Fenton 程序對於乙
二胺之降解確實具有理想效果。
ABSTRACT 
The ethylenediamine contained in the organic stripping liquid, which is generally used in the 
semi-conductor producing process, is the major organic and refractory wastewater pollution. The 
non-biodegradable characteristics of ethylenediamine lead to the difficulty of wastewater treatment 
by means of traditional biological treatment units. Hence, in this study, we tried to use the 
continuous dosing sono-Fenton process to degrade the ethylenediamine and investigate the effect of 
pH, H2O2 dosage, Fe2+ dosage and initial ethylenediamine on the degradation and minerzalization 
of ethylenediamine. During the reaction, the profiles of pH and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) 
were monitoring and recorded on-line and the results of H2O2, total organic carbon (TOC) and 
concentration of ethylenediamine were measured. Experimental results indicated that 34.6% of 
ethylenediamine was degraded coupled with 33.2% mineralization within the reaction time of 60 
min at pH 3.0, 25℃, H2O2 of 1 mg/min and Fe2+ of 5 mg/L in sono-Fenton system. Comparing with 
the sole ultrasound (17% of ethylenediamine degradation coupled with 17.3% mineralization) or 
Fenton process (20% of ethylenediamine degradation coupled with 18.3% mineralization), it was 
found that the combination of ultrasound and Fenton process, namely sono-Fenton process, showed 
the better degradation efficiency for ethylenediamine. In addition, increasing the dosage of H2O2 
from 1 to 4 mg/min led to the increase in ethylenediamine degradation from 46.6% to as high as 
61.0%. When the Fe2+ dosage was increased from 5 mg/L to 20 mg/L, degradation of 
ethylenediamine increased from 34.6% to 49.2% (H2O2 2 mg/min). As the Fe2+ was increased to as 
high as 40 mg/L, degradation of ethylenediamine significantly decreased to 30.9%, which indicated 
that additional dosage of Fe2+ was worthless in the enhancement of ethylenediamine degradation. 
Experimental results also pointed out the lower reaction pH and ethylenedimaine concentration 
were profitable to the degradation of ethylenediamine by sono-Fenton process. Based on the results 
shown in this study, the optimal dosage of H2O2 and Fe2+ should be 4 mg/min and 20 mg/L. At this 
condition, 61.0% of ethylenediamine is degraded coupled with 53.5% mineralization; in addition,

3.1 pH 之影響
本研究首先針對 pH 對反應程序分解乙二胺之影響進行討論，乙二胺初始濃度設定為 100 
mg/L，過氧化氫及 Fe2+ 濃度為 1 mg/min 及 5 mg/L ，初始 pH 為 3.0 - 6.0。實驗結果顯
示，在亞鐵離子及過氧化氫添加後，ORP 較初始值提高 40-134mV，之後皆趨近平穩 (圖 2)，
顯示出不同之 pH 對於初始的 ORP 值有著顯著的影響，pH 值越低，初始 pH 值卻越高。
由圖 5 之結果顯示，當過氧化氫添加濃度為
鐘後，乙二胺之去除率約為 46.4%
因此，由添加不同濃度之過氧化氫的實驗結果可得知
劑量。而由 sono-Fenton 程序在不同過氧化氫濃度條件下分解乙二胺之
果顯示，過氧化氫添加濃度為
提高為 4 mg/min 時，TOC 去除率約為

Abstract 
This study tried to use a sono-Fenton process to degrade the ethylenediamine wastewater for 
enhancing its biodegradability and investigated the effect of experimental parameters, such as 
H2O2 and Fe2+ concentration and reaction temperature, on the degradation of ethylenediamine. The 
reaction was initiated at ethylenediamine concentration of 50 mg/L and pH 3. Experimental results 
indicated that degradation of ethylenediamine were insignificant with a sole ultrasound for 60 min 
reaction, where the biodegradability (BOD5/COD) was slightly increased from 0 to 0.2. More than 
50% of ethylenediamine degradation coupled with 20% DOC (dissolved organic carbon) removal 
was found at H2O2 and Fe2+ of 100 and 40 mg/L in sono-Fenton process. Biodegradability of 
treated wastewater was also effectively increased to 0.7, which could be supposed as a 
biodegradable wastewater. Five reaction temperatures were carried out in this study, where the 
25oC was suitable for ethylenediamine wastewater degradation than other reaction temperatures. 
Based on the results shown in this study, sono-Fenton process not only could degrade the 
ethylenediamine and transfer them as biodegradable but also be suitable using as a pre-treatment 
method for refractory ethylenediamine wastewater degradation before biological treatment units.

INTRODUCTION 
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been employed as the attractive alternative methods for 
the removal of hazardous materials from wastewaters. In principle, AOPs are known to generate 
highly reactive and non-selective hydroxyl radicals (OH), which is able to oxidize almost all toxic 
organic compounds and non-biodegradable pollutants. Ultrasound is a novel method in which water 
molecule undergoes molecular fragmentation and releases OH through high-frequency acoustic 
cavitation (Hoffmann et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2008, Joseph et al., 2009). Over the last few years, 
ultrasound has been studied extensively for the degradation of organic pollutants in 
water/wastewater. However, the major disadvantage of water sonolysis is the generation of 
insufficient quantity of OH; thus, several sonolysis studies conducted with the addition of 
chemicals such as Fenton’s reagent or ozone, or combination with UV radiation have amplified the 
ultrasonic action (Kidak and Ince, 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2010a, b).  
 
The production of OH by ultrasound with water molecules has been shown in Eq. 1 to Eq. 4. The 
reaction mechanisms in the presence of Fe2+ and H2O2 (Fenton’s reagent) in an aqueous solution 
with ultrasound are much more complex than as reported in Eq. 1 to Eq. 4. It is well known that the 
degradation of organic pollutants under Fenton oxidation is mainly by OH/OOH that can be 
generated by the inter-reaction of H2O2 with Fe3+ and Fe2+ in acid solution according to Eq. 5 and 
Eq. 6. These OH production reactions have been used extensively for the oxidation of many 
hazardous organic pollutants such as phenols, chlorinated phenol, pesticides and herbicides from 
water and wastewater, and to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved organic carbon 
(DOC) content (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Momani et al., 2004). The Fe3+ formed according to Eq. 
5 and Eq. 6 subsequently will react with H2O2 and produce a complex intermediate (Fe-O2H2+) as 
shown in Eq. 7. Although the Fe-O2H2+ can be decomposed to Fe2+ and OOH (Eq. 8), the reaction 
rate is much smaller (Sun et al., 2007). On the other hand, the Fe3+ can also react with OOH and 
forms Fe2+, O2 and H+ (Eq. 9); further, the formed Fe2+ can react with H2O2 (Eq. 1) and produce 
METHODS 
 
Materials 
The chemical reagents used in this study were ethylenediamine (purity > 99.9%), ferrous sulfate 
(FeSO47H2O, purity > 99.5%), and an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30% w/w in 
water). During the analytical processes, potassium iodide (KI), hydrogenophtalate potassium 
(C8H5KO4) (KHP), benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) and other chemicals were used in determining H2O2, 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ethylenediamine concentrations. All the chemicals were the 
purest grade commercially available and were used without further purification. 
 
Experimental apparatus  
A schematic drawing of the reactor is shown in Figure 1. A sonicator (Microson VCX 750, 0-
750 W, USA) equipped with s sealed converter (Model CV 33, 63.5 mm in diameter and 183 mm in 
length) and titanium probe tip (Part. No. 630-0210, 25 mm in diameter and 122 mm in length) 
operated at 20 kHz was used in this study. The amplitude in the sono-Fenton tests was adjusted at 
30% (225 W power output) without pulse length setup. Reactions were performed in a cylindrical 
reactor (1 L working volume) with a cooling jacket and a circulating temperature controller to 
maintain the reaction temperature at certain level during the tests. A magnetic mixer controlled the 
mixing speed of the solution at 100 rpm. Aeration inside the reactor was maintained at 0.2 L of air 
per minute. Sensors for oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and pH (Suntex PC-3200, Taiwan) 
were placed in the solution for real-time monitoring. Prior to commencing the experiment, the ORP 
sensor was rechecked using a standard solution of 220 mV. 
 
Experimental conditions and procedure 
The value of the initial pH in all experiments was 3 attained by adding 1 N H2SO4 as required. 
During the reactions, the pH values varied freely without any hand correction. Initial 
ethylenediamine concentration was designed as 50 mg/L. In sono-Fenton process, the effects of 
H2O2 dosage (0-200 mg/L), Fe2+ dosages (5-50 mg/L) and reaction temperature (20-50oC) on 
ethylenediamine degradation were studied. Total reaction duration was 60 min, and the water 
samples were collected at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min for further analyses. 
 
Sample analysis 
Determination of ethylenediamine was analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS-QP2010, Shimadzu, Japan) using a DB-5MS column (length 30 m, thickness 
0.25 μm, diameter 0.25 mm) in the GC oven. Before analysis, 5 mL water samples were collected at 
set time intervals and 1 mL of benzaldehyde was added and mixed with the water sample for 30 
minutes at a mixing speed of 150 rpm for derivation. The GC oven temperature ranged from 70°C 
(holding time 2 min) to 230°C (holding time 5 min) at a ramp of 20°C/min. The injector and 
detector temperatures were maintained at 230°C and 280°C, respectively. High purity (99.99%) 
helium was used as a carrier gas (1.5 mL/min) and the sample was analyzed in splitless mode. Mass 
spectra were obtained by electron-impact (EI) at 70 eV using the full-scan mode.  
 
Prior to sample analysis, a calibration curve was plotted with known concentrations of 
ethylenediamine (1.56 to 50 mg/L) and an area response with an R2 of 0.995. Figure 2 shows the 
mass spectrum of ethylenediamine determination in GC-MS analysis. Based on the appearance of 
mass spectrum including peak 91, 104 and 133 and comparison with the mass spectra library in GC-
MS, it can be identified as the 1,2-(dibenzylideneamino)ethane, which is the derivation compound 
of ethylenediamine by adding benzaldehyde, and the similarity was greater than 99%. The H2O2 
concentration was measured by the KI titration method followed the steps proposed in Kormann et 
al. (1988). Ethylenediamine mineralization was determined by DOC concentrations, which were 
(20%) was similar to the result of H2O2 100 mg/L. Therefore, the H2O2 dosage set at 100 mg/L in 
following experiments.

Effect of Fe2+ dosage 
To study the effect of Fe2+ concentration on the degradation of ethylenediamine, five Fe2+ 
concentrations with 100 mg/L H2O2 were carried out and the results were shown in Figure 6. It is 
found in Figure 6 that 25% of ethylenediamine was degraded while the Fe2+ concentration ranged 
from 5 - 20 mg/L. As the Fe2+ concentration was increased to 40 mg/L, degradation of 
ethylenediamine increased to 40%, which indicated that higher the Fe2+ concentration at a certain 
H2O2 level, higher the degradation of ethylenediamine. This could be explained by the more 
formations of OH based on the effectively reaction among H2O2, Fe2+ and sonication. Stavarache et 
al. (2002) proposed a comparable result that the increment of Fenton’s reagent was useful to 
produce large amounts of OH with sonication. In addition, degradation efficiency of soluble 
organic pollutants was increased. However, in this study, as the Fe2+ concentration was increased to 
50 mg/L, degradation of ethylenediamine decreased to 32%, which was slightly lower than that at 
Fe2+ of 40 mg/L. Pradhan and Gogate (2010) tried to use hydrodynamic cavitation and Fenton 
reagent in the degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) and found that the degradation PNP were 56.2 
and 57.6% at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L Fe2+ concentration and 5 mg/L H2O2. This result indicated that 
increase of the Fe2+ could enhance the degradation of organic compound but the enhancement was 
insignificant. Also, additional amounts of Fe2+ would lead to the shadow effect on the formation of 
OH and produce iron type sludge. In this study, based on the data shown in Figure 6, 40 mg/L Fe2+ 
was estimated as the better Fe2+ concentration in ethylenediamine degradation. 
 
Effect of temperature 
Figure 7 shows the profiles of ethylenediamine degradation at different reaction temperatures (20-
50oC) with H2O2 and of Fe2+ of 100 and 40 mg/L and pH 3. It is found that the degradation of 
ethylenediamine was increased from 20 to 39% as the reaction temperature increased from 20 to 
25oC. However, as the reaction temperature was continued increased to 30, 40 and 50oC, 
degradation of ethylenediamine decreased to 26, 18 and 16%; that is, higher the reaction 
temperature, lower the degradation of ethylenediamine. Several researches (Riesz et al., 1990; 
Joseph et al., 2009) proposed that the sonochemical process generated two mechanisms for the 
degradation of organic compounds: (1) the reaction with the OH and (2) thermal reaction and the 
reaction mechanism of the ultrasonic bubble cavity was shown in Joseph et al. (2009). There were 
three reaction regions could be observed sonication system: (1) bubble cavity (or gas phase), (2) 
                                                     Eq. (13) 
 
Table 1 shows the results of ethylenediamine degradation, DOC removal, COS and BOD5/COD 
ratio at different reaction conditions. It is found that the percentages of DOC removal were much 
lower than those of ethylenediamine degradation. In fact, the molecular structure of 
ethylenediamine only consists of a C-C single bond and two amino groups. This single and 
saturated C-C bond is difficult to be oxidized in solution phase, which resulting in the low removal 
percentage of DOC. In COS, the original ethylenediamine COS was 0.25. After treatments, the 
COS increased to 1.68 – 2.70, where the highest one was observed in the experimental condition of 
H2O2 100 mg/L, Fe2+ 40 mg/L and 25oC. Amat et al. (2009) proposed that the increment of COS 
could be estimated as the efficiency of oxidation process on the degradation of pollutants; that is, 
remarkable increase of COS indicated a high consequence of oxidation process. Hence, in this study, 
a higher COS could be identified as a better choice in ethylenediamine. It is found in Table 1 that 
the COS of five sono-Fenton process were greater than those of ultrasound/H2O2 process, which 
could be explained by the contribution of Fe2+ in the increase of ethylenediamine degradation. 
Results of BOD5/COD ratio change in Table 1 also proposed that the biodegradability increased 
with the increase of Fe2+ and H2O2 concentrations; the maximum one (BOD5/COD = 0.81) was 
observed at H2O2 100 mg/L, Fe2+ 40 mg/L and 25oC, too, which was same to the COS result.

CONCLUSIONS 
This study used the sono-Fenton process to degrade the non-biodegradable ethylenediamine 
wastewater and investigated the effect of temperature, concentration of H2O2 and Fe2+ on the 
treatment efficiency. Experimental results indicated that the increase of H2O2 and Fe2+ was 
profitable to the increase of ethylenediamine degradation and biodegradability; however, additional
