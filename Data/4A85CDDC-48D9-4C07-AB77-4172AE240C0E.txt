Fig. 1. Two methods of wormhole attacks 
In this paper, m1 and m2 of Figure 1 are called a tunnel ingress node and a tunnel 
egress node, respectively. Conversely, if a route is from node d to node s, then m2 is the 
tunnel ingress node and m1 is the tunnel egress node. A malicious node can be a tunnel 
ingress node and/or an egress node. The paper discusses how to deploy some nodes, 
executing an intrusion detection system (IDS) into a MANET so as to detect and isolate 
wormhole nodes. The defense mechanism executed on an IDS node is called an 
Anti-Wormhole Mechanism (AWM), which is used to sniff routing messages of 
regular nodes within their transmission range. IDS nodes can determine if there is a 
tunnel ingress node according to the pairing of RREQ and RREP in the AODV routing 
protocol, and also determine if there is a tunnel egress node, according to RREP, being 
normally processed in a valid time. When the abnormal score exceeds the threshold, 
IDS can broadcast a block message to all nodes so as to jointly isolate the malicious 
nodes that possibly execute wormhole attacks. The remainder of this paper is organized 
as follows: Section 2 reviews the related works on prevention of wormhole attacks in 
MANETs; Section 3 presents the function of AWM executed in IDS; Section 4 shows 
some results of ns2; and Section 5 presents the conclusions.  
2   Related Works 
The following is a briefing on related researches concerning the three different approaches 
in defending against wormhole attacks. The first is merely to modify the routing protocol 
to avoid wormhole nodes in path discovery, such as [2], and [3]. The second is to equip 
extra hardware for a node, like a positioning system, a time synchronization mechanism, 
or a directed antenna, in addition to modifying the routing protocol. Some of them are [1], 
[4], and [5]. Finally, the third is to deploy some special nodes executing Intrusion Detec-
tion Systems (IDSs) with or without hardware support, such as [6] and [7].  
3   The Proposed Intrusion Detection System 
Three prerequisites are assumed in this paper as follows:  
 
1. Two neighboring IDS nodes are in the transmission range of each other so as to 
transmit block messages to each other. 
256 M.-Y. Su and K.-L. Chiang 
 
The following paragraphs will explain the algorithm of AWM executed on IDS 
nodes. AWM maintains four tables: the RQ Table, RP Table, SN Table, and Nr Table, 
as shown in Table 2. The RQ table records RREQs sniffed by an IDS node within its 
transmission range. The RP Table records RREPs sniffed by an IDS node within its 
transmission range. This implies that for the RREP, the latest forwarded node is Node 5 
and is destined to Node 1. If Node 1 continues to be within the IDS’s transmission 
range and is not the end of the RREP (the source node of the path), and does not for-
ward the RREP within a specific period, then the suspicious value of Node 1 will be 
added with 1 by the IDS.  
The Nr Table records Hello Messages sniffed by an IDS node within its transmission 
range; namely, it records the list of neighboring nodes. As shown in Table 2 (c), Nodes 
3, 4, and 7 exist within the range of transmission of the IDS node. The SN (suspicious 
node) Table, as shown in Table 2 (d), records the suspicious values of neighboring 
nodes within the IDS’s transmission range. The suspicious value is an important basis 
for a IDS, determining whether a neighboring node is a malicious node. At present, the 
suspicious value of Node 3 in Table 2 (d) is 1. Assuming it is less than the threshold, the 
status is “inactive”; whereas the suspicious value of Node 4 is 6; assuming that it 
reaches the threshold, the status is “active” and should be blocked.

Fig. 3. Total packet loss rates without IDS 
When one pair of wormholes exists, the packet loss rate is increased to 47.66%. If two 
pairs of wormholes exist, the packet loss rate will continue to increase to 54.11%. 
Figure 3 shows that wormhole nodes can successfully grab the routes and drop packets 
to conduct a high packet loss rate.   
Considering the deployment of IDS nodes, if IDS nodes need to cover the entire 2000 
m × 2000 m area, 90 IDS nodes are required as shown in Figure 4(a). However, it is 
difficult to deploy 90 IDS nodes to realize such a full coverage of IDS in a real MANET. 
In this study, we let four neighboring IDSs form a local coverage. It is assumed that for 
the case of two wormhole nodes, a local coverage can cover one wormhole node, as 
shown in Figure 4(b), and for the case of four wormhole nodes, two local coverages can 
cover two wormhole nodes of the two pairs, as shown in Figure 4(c).

Fig. 4. Full coverage, one local coverage, and two local coverages of IDS 
When two (one pair) wormhole nodes exist in a MANET, improvement is shown by 
the decrease in the total packet loss rate by the full coverage and local coverage as 
shown in Figure 5(a). As for the full coverage of IDS (90 IDS nodes), the performance 
is best when the pause time is 10, with the packet loss rate down from 45.07% to 
12.55%. This is close to the packet loss rate of AODV and MAODV when there is no 
attack, representing the fact that wormhole nodes can be detected rapidly and blocked.

(pause time set as 10 seconds). If there is only local coverage (4 IDSs), the packet loss 
rate can be decreased to 29.24% (pause time set as 10 seconds). When there are four 
(two pairs) wormhole nodes in the MANET, the average of total packet loss rate is 
54.11%. In the case of full coverage (90 IDSs), the packet loss rate can be successfully 
decreased to 27.64% (pause time set as 5 seconds). If there are two local coverage (8 
IDSs), the packet loss rate can also be decreased to 40.63% (pause time set as 0).
