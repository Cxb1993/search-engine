and data accessing process in hard disk drives 
(HDDs) [3]. However, potential failure modes 
are caused by the head burnish induced 
clearance variation including wrinkles, buried 
defects, and nano-asperities. Extensive 
analysis has shown that wrinkles and buried 
particles have no correlation with head 
burnish. Nano-asperities are believed to be 
particles from a previous polish step found 
protruding through the magnetic layer of a 
PMR disk. The asperities are very small 
measuring 2-3 nm high and 40-80 nm wide 
(Fig. 1). Developing a polishing process to 
eliminate surface asperities and residual 
surface defects of the glass substrate in a 
Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (PMR) 
disk is therefore a necessity to meet the 
challenges of future technology [4]. One 
strategy is to use a polyester-based polish tape, 
much smaller diamond abrasive, and a 
suitable coolant for complete abrasive 
dispersion. Pressures on the order of 16-40 psi 
combined with suitable oscillation and 
revolution speeds are required to polish the 
glass surface to the required performance level. 
The physical and mechanical characteristics of 
the polished substrate surface quality 
determine the quality of the in-plane magnetic 
alignment [5]. Polished substrates with low 
surface roughness have higher spectral 
signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) [6]. The surface 
roughness is a parameter that characterizes the 
directional preference of the magnetic 
properties of the PMR storage media. Possible 
mechanisms which contribute to the 
crystallography of the layered magnetic 
structures [7,8], are lower intergranular 
exchange coupling [9], and stress effects [10]. 
Polished substrates with enough stock 
removal and less polish scratches can reduce 
the media defects [11]. Polish patterns with 
smooth surface morphology and low surface 
defects yield disks with optimized magnetic 
and defect performance. However, increasing 
the polish stock removal rate with larger 
diamond sizes may cause scratching while the 
use of smaller diamond sizes to reduce polish 
scratches may not be aggressive enough to 
eliminate the substrate surface asperities to the 
required quality. To keep pace with demand 
for higher stock removal rate to improve 
defectivity and surface quality in the HDD 
industry, diamond manufacturers developed 
fascinating morphological refinements to the 
base structure of diamond. Microcrystallines, 
graphitic shells, and diamond nanotechnology 
each induced significant process improvement 
steps in the HDD timeline storage density.

Historically, the HDD industry has in the 
past utilized Synthetic Monocrystalline 
Diamond, Synthetic Polycrystalline Diamond 
[12], Heat-Treated Synthetic Monocrystalline 
Diamond [13] for 1~120 GB HDD density 
during the 1995 to 2009 timeframe. Ishizuka 
[14] claims that the heat treating process 
utilized in HDD processing forms minute 
cracks within the crystal. Excessive loading 
will also fracture the pieces. The 120 GB disk 
also required further improvements in sputter 
alloy compositions [15] to reduce the 
head-disk spacing [16,17] to improve SNR. At 
this point, and perhaps the final phase of 
 4
suitable coolant and DI water. The average 
cluster size of all these three types of diamond 
slurries is approximately 22.4 nm and the 
range of the slurry size varied from 9 to 35 nm. 
Glass substrates after normal polishing and 
clean processes were sequentially deposited 
with a Cr foundation layer, Co-alloy magnetic 
layer and hydrogenated carbon overcoat by 
using an Intevac 250B disc dc-sputtering 
system. This is then followed by the 
application of a lubrication layer. We then 
compared the polished surface Ra, polish 
stock removal amount, polish scratch level 
and pixel count of the polished glass 
substrates. Media defect performance of the 
disks prepared by the three types of diamonds 
was then performed. Atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) is used to characterize the polished 
surface morphology. Optical Surface Analyzer 
(OSA) was used for polished surface scratch 
and pixel count measurement. HRTEM, XPS, 
Raman and BET were used for the diamond 
particle analysis in order to obtain the 
structure, diamond contained percentage, 
particle density and surface area. Media defect 
count is determined using a commercial defect 
tester. 
四、結果與討論 
Characteristics of diamond particles 
Fig. 2 demonstrates HRTEM photos of 
NCD-90, NCD-80 and NCD-70 diamond 
particles. It is readily apparent that the NCD 
particles are made up of a myriad of smaller 
‘crystallites’. Fig. 2a shows the HRTEM 
structure of NCD-90, its average primary 
crystalline size is about 8 nm. There is a better 
select area diffraction (SAD) on (111), (220) 
and (311) planes, which means less 
non-diamond carbon content in NCD-90. Fig. 
2b shows the HRTEM structure of NCD-80, 
its average primary crystalline size is about 6 
nm.  There is better SAD on (111) and (220) 
planes. Fig. 2c shows the HRTEM structure of 
NCD-70, its average primary crystalline size 
is about 6 nm similar to NCD-80. There is 
better select area diffraction (SAD) on (111) 
and (220) planes also similar again to 
NCD-80. 
Fig. 3 demonstrates representative XPS 
spectra of NCD-90, NCD-80 and NCD-70 
diamond particles. The percentage of 
crystalline diamond was calculated from the 
peak area of three NCD samples compared 
with peak area of standard diamond. The error 
of measurement is about ±3%. Based on this 
measurement, the percentage of crystalline 
diamond in NCD-90, NCD-80 and NCD-70 is 
90%, 80% and 70%, respectively. Amorphous 
content calculation is based on the diamond 
(111) peak. The remaining percentage of 
non-diamond in NCD-90, NCD-80 and 
NCD-70 is 10%, 20% and 30%. It is readily 
apparent that the NCD-90 is comprised of a 
higher diamond percentage. 
Fig. 4 Raman spectroscopy identifies 
diamond (D) and graphite (G) components of 
NCD-80 and NCD-70 diamond particles. Two 
Raman peaks were identified in Fig. 5a of 
NCD-80. Its G/D ratio is 3.29. The lower G/D 
ratio may indicate less non-diamond carbon in 
the sample. Three Raman peaks were 
identified in Fig. 5b of NCD-70. Its G/D ratio 
is 4.45, which shows a much larger G/D ratio, 
indicating relatively high non-diamond carbon 
content. The Raman spectrum analysis of 
NCD-90, NCD-80 and NCD-70 diamond 
particles is summarized in Table 1. The results 
show that NCD-90 exhibits two peaks as well 
as NCD-80. But, the NCD-90 exhibits the 
lowest G/D ratio 2.88 compared with NCD-80 
and NCD-70.

generates a relatively large Ra compared to 
NCD-80 and NCD-70. This is because of the 
higher diamond percentage, higher particle 
density and lower particle surface area in 
NCD-90. Its polish penetration depth causes a 
rougher polish surface, which in turn causes 
the surface scratches thus increasing the disk 
defects. On the other hand, The NCD-70 
slurry generates a relatively lower Ra 
compared to NCD-90 and NCD-80. This is 
because of the lower diamond percentage with 
lower particle density and higher particle 
surface area in NCD-70. This lower polish 
penetration results in a smoother polish 
surface, which in turn generates less surface 
scratches, thus improving the disk defect 
density. Substrate polishing with NCD-70 
yields the lowest scratch and pixel count as 
compared to the other two types. The primary 
reason is that NCD-70 provides a larger 
surface area and less sharp edges for polish. 
The scratch count of a NCD-70 polished 
surface (22) is approximately 3 times lower in 
defects than a NCD-90 polished surface (71). 
The disk defect performance with NCD-70 is 
about 2 times better than that of NCD-90. 
NCD-80 performance in terms of polish 
surface Ra and scratch, and disk defects is in 
between that of NCD-90 and NCD-70. 
On the other hand, all three slurries show 
similar polish stock removal amounts, as 
shown in Table 2. There are two reasons for 
this. First, the contribution of NCD to improve 
polish stock removal amount is inherent in its 
particle density. NCD-90 exhibits a higher 
particle density which means it is harder and 
more aggressive in its removal rate during 
polish, thus increasing stock removal amount. 
The second contributing factor to polish 
removal performance is a function of the 
particle surface area itself. NCD-70 exhibits a 
higher particle surface area, which in turn 
provides more cutting edges to remove bulk 
from the substrate surface thus increasing 
stock removal. Additionally, since the 
NCD-70 cluster is a looser bonded formation 
than NCD-90 and NCD-80, its clusters will 
break down easier when acted upon by shear 
stresses, reducing the potential for scratches. 
Consider the surface density and surface area 
of NCD particles, these three NCD show 
similar stock removal amounts, but,  
NCD-70 can achieve the lower Ra, lower 
scratch count and lower defectivity because its 
physical characteristics. 
The contributing factors to finish good disk 
defect performance are a function of polish 
removal capability and scratch reduction. 
Therefore, rather than merely generating 
higher stock removal rate, the NCD-70 will 
aid in decreasing the polish scratches on the 
substrate surface. Furthermore, by optimizing 
the polish abrasive particle, one might 
optimize the polish stock removal rate and 
lower polish scratches of the NCD-70 
particles thus optimizing disk defect 
performance. This is readily observed in the 
experimental data regarding surface finish and 
defect performance. Surface roughness, polish 
scratch and pixel count of all disks polished 
surfaces are shown in Table 2. The lowest 
surface AFM Ra, polish scratch and pixel 
count, and disk defect are found to occur 
when using the NCD-70 slurry.
