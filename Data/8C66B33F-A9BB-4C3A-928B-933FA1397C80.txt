Abstract 
Plastic anisotropy is a typical property of 
many metals and it can have a significant 
effect of the limit load of structures. It is 
therefore of importance to evaluate this effect 
for typical geometries covered by compendia 
of flaw assessment procedures for limit load 
solutions. The present paper deals with typical 
highly undermatched specimens in pure 
bending and tension. It is assumed that the 
mis-match factor (the ratio of the yield stress 
of weld material to the yield stress of base 
material) is so small that plastic deformation 
solely occurs in the weld whereas the base 
material is elastic (rigid). The weld material 
obeys Hill’s quadratic orthotropic yield 
criterion. The variation of the upper bound 
bending moment and force with the thickness 
of the weld and anisotropic properties of the 
material is illustrated. Comparison with the 
isotropic case made shows that an effect of 
plastic anisotropy can be quite large. 
Keywords: bending, tension, limit load, 
highly undermatched welded joints, plastic 
anisotropy. 
 
1. Introduction 
The limit load is an essential input 
parameter of many defect assessment 
procedures [1]. Reviews of available limit load 
solutions are given in [2, 3]. It follows from 
these reviews and [4] that isotropic yield 
criteria are usually adopted to find the limit 
load. However, many structural components 
are made of anisotropic materials. In particular, 
in the case of welded structures both base and 
weld materials can be anisotropic. A significant 
effect of plastic anisotropy of base material on 
the limit load of several overmatched 
specimens has been demonstrated in [5, 6]. 
However, in the case of welding of some 
modern materials the weld material is much 
softer than the base material, for example [7, 8]. 
It can result in such a deformation pattern in 
the limit state that plastic flow occurs in the 
weld material whereas the base material 
remains elastic [7, 8]. Based on such an 
assumption, an upper bound limit load solution 
for a tensile panel with a crack in the weld 
obeying Hill’s quadratic orthotropic yield 
criterion [9] has been proposed in [10]. As in 
the case of overmatched specimens, the 
solution demonstrates a significant effect of 
plastic anisotropy on the limit load. In the 
present paper, the same material model is 
adopted to predict an effect of anisotropy of the 
weld on the limit load of a typical highly 
undermatched specimen in pure bending and 
tension. The effect is illustrated by means of 
comparison with the corresponding limit load 
solution for the isotropic specimen. The 
kinematically admissible velocity field used

x yv v y xω ω= + = −v i j i j          (4) 
where i and j are the base vectors of the 
Cartesian coordinates, and xv  and yv  are 
the velocity vector components, xv yω=  and 
yv xω= − . The velocity vector in the plastic 
zone will be denoted by u. It follows from 
equation (4) that the x-component of the 
velocity vector v is independent of x and, in 
particular, xv yω=  at x H= . Therefore, 
one of the boundary conditions on the velocity 
field in the plastic zone is 
xu yω=       at x H=             (5) 
The other boundary condition follows from 
the symmetry with respect to the y – axis and 
can be written as 
0xu =        at 0x =       (6)   
To satisfy the boundary conditions (5) and (6), 
the x-component of the velocity vector in the 
plastic zone can be taken in the form

Using the incompressibility equation, 
0x yu x u y∂ ∂ + ∂ ∂ = , and equation (7) it is 
possible to find the y-component of the 
velocity vector in the plastic zone as

It is known from the theory of plasticity of 
isotropic materials that the real velocity field 
is singular in the vicinity of velocity 
discontinuity surfaces [11]. Even though no 
general analysis is available for anisotropic 
materials, a particular solution given in [12] 
shows that velocity fields in such materials 
can also be singular and that the asymptotic 
behaviour of the velocity field in the vicinity 
of velocity discontinuity surfaces is the same 
as in the case of isotropic materials. In 
particular, the velocity component tangent to 
the velocity discontinuity surface should 
follow a square root rule in the form 
( )0 1u U U s o sτ = + +   as 0s →     (9) 
where s is the distance from the surface and 
0U  and 1U  are independent of s. The 
simplest choice of the function ( )f x  
satisfying equation (9) and the condition that 
yu  is an even function of x is

In (31) and (33) it is necessary to replace 
( )0bζ γ  with the function of γ according to 
(20) and to exclude 0c  by means of (19), and 
cotϕ  in the integrand of (33) should be 
excluded by means of (31). As a result, the 
integrand of (33) is a function of γ.  
The value of the integral (33) over the 
interval from γ δ=  to 2γ pi δ= −  denoted 
by 20b

Using (39), (40) and (41) the right hand 
side of (38) can be minimized numerically 
with no difficulty. The variation of mu with h 
at different value of c is shown in Fig.4. 
Calculation has been carried out at 
0.0001δ = . Note that the solution proposed is 
valid if and only if 1dz ≤  (or 1dζ ≤ ), as 
follows from Fig.2. The values of c1 and, with 
the use of (21), bζ  are found along with 
determining the optimal value of mu. The 
variation of the value of b bz ζ=  with h at 
different value of c is shown in Fig.5. It is 
seen from this figure that the condition 1dz ≤  
is satisfied in all cases considered. It also 
follows from physical arguments that 0xyξ ≥  
in the plastic zone. Therefore, (22) shows that 
c1 should be negative. Figure 6 illustrates that 
this condition is satisfied.

2.5 CONCLUSIONS  
A new upper bound limit load solution for 
bending of highly undermatched welded 
specimen has been found. Its main 
distinguished feature, as compared with other 
known solutions, is that an effect of plastic 
anisotropy of the weld has been taken into 
account. This effect is illustrated in Fig.4 
where the isotropic case corresponds to 0c = . 
It is seen from this figure that the limit 
bending moment can be either larger or 
smaller than that for the isotropic case. In 
order to show a relative effect of plastic 
anisotropy, the variation of
