Abstract 
In the micro-cutting process, a variety of sensors can be used for monitoring the tool wear. In which, the 
acoustic emission signal is a type of high frequency signal that is generated mainly by dislocation motion in 
materials and contains the energy from around 10 kHz to 1 MHz. Due to its high frequency characteristics, 
AE signal will be more difficult to be influenced by the low frequency background noise in cutting.  
Considering the AE generation and propagation mechanisms, the model of the relation between the acoustic 
emission signal generation and tool wear was established for cutting processes.  At the same time, the effect 
of tool wear on the AE signal generation in frequency and amplitude was studied as well. In the model 
establishment, the finite element analysis was first used for calculating the shear strain rate distribution on the 
shear plane based on the orthogonal cutting assumption.  Following the FEM analysis, the dislocation 
density in materials was calculated based on the calculated stress rate. Finally, the AE signal picked up by the 
senor was calculated based on the distribution of AE source on the shear plane  
An experiment was implemented to verify the accuracy of the established model, and the results show 
that both the experimental and simulation data show that the amplitude of the AE signals increase as tool wear 
increases. Moreover, in frequency domain, the frequency signal energy moves to the higher frequency range 
for both cases.  The results obtained from the above investigations show that the model established in this 
study can be use for predicting the effect of tool wear on the AE signal generation.

射訊號能量大小之關係。Gorman 及 Prosser[13]則是利用鉛的破裂來模擬聲射訊號，因而發現到聲射訊
號的振幅大小和聲射源的定位有關。Trochidis 及 Polyzos [14-17]發現聲射訊號的產生機制為差排消滅

包括時間分析、傅利葉轉換及小波轉換等，另外則是刀具磨耗評估法則，包括型態分類法、模糊分類
及類神經網路等。 
為了建立聲射源產生、傳遞與刀具磨耗之關係，微細切削力學與磨耗之關係模型扮演著重要的角
色。在一般切削狀態中，切削力主要由剪切區材料變形所產生，聲射源也主要分布於剪切面與切削/刀
具接觸面，但是當未切削厚度(uncut thickness)與刀刃半徑達到同數量級時，犁切力的影響便逐漸重要。
Waldorf [19-20]等人建立滑線場(slip-line field)模型，分析不同刀刃半徑與犁切力之關係，而發現到在正
交切削狀態之下，刀刃半徑越大，犁切力影響越顯著。Karpat [21]等人利用 Waldorf 的滑線場模型探討
刀腹磨耗對於切削力、應力及溫度分布的影響。在正交金屬切削模型的建立與模擬方面，通常可使用
有限元素法，有限元素法是將實體利用網格劃分為許多的元素，再分別計算各元素內所受到的力量值，
因此在工程分析上利用有限元素法進行分析可以達到非常準確的結果。最早利用有限元素法模擬正交
金屬切削時切屑形成的是 Strenkowski 和 Carrol [22]。Mamalis[23]等人利用熱-機械性質的平面應變正交
金屬切削模型，並使用 MARC 有限元素分析軟體進行模擬，其切屑分離準則採用幾何分離，當臨界距
離到達 3μm 時，節點產生分離動作。Shih [24-26]利用平面應變有限元素法來分析正交金屬切削過程，
並結合應變、溫度、應變率、液靜壓力及傾角(rake angle)等不同切削參數的影響來模擬切削過程，而
發現到溫度、塑性應變、有效應力等最高值皆出現在第二變形區，刀尖和工件接觸端則產生最大的熱，
另外刀具傾角為 5 度時，元素會產生最大的塑性應變率。Yen[27-28]等人設計不同刀具幾何形狀以分析
切削力的改變，另外利用泰勒關係式及其擴充方程式作為刀具壽命之數學模型，並使用有限元素分析

[11] also concluded that the effect of tool wear on the high 
frequency energy can be observed by sound signals in the 
turning process.  Lu and Kannatey-Asibu [12-13] obtained 
audible sound radiation from a microphone for tool wear 
detection in turning.   For its applications in the micro 
machining, Yen et al. [14] shows the potential of sound signal 
applying to the micro tool wear monitoring.  Chen et al. [15] 
develop the model of micro tool dynamics and shows that the 
sound signal collected by the microphone contains more 
accurate information for micro tool vibration than the 
accelerometer installed on the workpiece.  In the multi-sensor 
system development, sound signals are also studied [16-17], as 
well as in the predicting the cutting performance [18]. 
With properly selected sensors, it is also important to 
process the signal with appropriate algorithms which can 
extract the most valuable features and classify the patterns of 
interest reliably.  Various pattern recognition techniques are 
reviewed by Nieddu and Patrizi [19].  Emel and Kannatey-
Asibu [20] developed a tool failure monitoring system in 
turning based on linear discriminant function analysis.   In 
research done by Anastassopoulos et al. [21], classification 
error is shown to strongly depend upon feature selection and 
problem complexity.  The effect of feature dimensions is also 
investigated for different algorithms by Van Ness and Simpson 
[22] and Van Ness [23]. 
In this study, the sound signals were collected during the 
cutting processes for classifying the tool wear condition.  The 
monitoring system was developed with three steps featuring the 
tasks of signal transformation, the feature selection, and the 
classification. The collected sound signal was first transformed 
from time domain to the frequency domain. After the 
transformation, some of the spectral components (features) 
were selected based on the class scatter criteria and serve as the 
input for the classifier.  In the classification step, the Fisher 
Linear Discriminant (FLD) was adopted for the classifier 
design.  Finally, an experiment was implemented to provide 
the signals for developing the system and evaluate the system 
performance. 
 
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT  
A sound based tool condition monitoring system is shown 
in Fig. 1. The tasks developed in the system include the signal 
transformation, feature selection, and classification.  The fast 
Fourier transformation (FFT) combined with the class scatter 
criterion were adopted in this study for the signal 
transformation and feature selection.  On the other hand, the 
Fisher Linear Discriminant was chosen as the model to develop 
the classifier.

Signal Transformation and Feature Selection 
For a sensor base tool wear monitoring system, the time 
domain signals usually hold lower sensitivity to the micro tool 
wear change and are usually transformed into the feature space 
for the following classifier design.  In this study, the fast 
Fourier transformation of original time series signals were 
conducted to provide the spectral components as the features 
for the micro tool wear monitoring.    After transforming the 
time domain signals into the frequency domain, the equal 
energy band of spectral components were considered as the 
features for tool condition classification.  In order to analyze 
the effect of the size of the energy band on tool wear 
classification rate, the average of spectral components inside 
the selected energy band were computed as the new spectral 
components for the corresponding energy band.  For all 
features, some features might be sensitive to the change of tool 
wear and considered as the valuable features for identifying the 
tool condition.  However, there are a number of features 
keeping unchanged in the test as tool wear proceeds or 
changing by the other parameters such as material, noise, et al.   
In the case with the high number of feature selected but not 
related to the tool wear condition, the system efficiency will 
decrease due to the higher computing loading in the neural 
network model development.  At the same time, the sensitivity 
of system will also decrease because the contribution of the tool 
wear related features will decreased in the network due to the 
increase of effect of the noise sensitive and unchanged features.  
In contrast, in the case with the low number of features selected 
for condition classification, the drawback will be observed 
because the information related to the tool wear condition will 
be removed in the system development and lead to the decrease 
of the monitoring performance.  Therefore, the proper 
selection of features closely related to tool condition change 
will play a very important role in improving the performance of 
tool condition monitoring system in micro cutting. 
In order to evaluate the correlation of each feature to micro 
tool condition and select the right features for tool wear 
monitoring, the class scatter criterion is adopted and the cost 
function   kkR
kkRJ c
,
,  which estimates the between-class scatter 
to within-class scatter ratio is used for analysis [20].  The

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Signal Analysis 
The tool wear for the micro end mill after the first and fifth 
cutting pass in the test were investigated by the microscope and 
recorded as shown in Fig. 5.  In which, 6μm flank wear was 
observed after the first pass of cutting, so do the 30 μm flank 
wear after the fifth pass of cutting.  During cutting the flank 
wear is observed to increase as long as the cutting proceeded.  
The tool after fifth pass of cutting for was considered as worn 
tool in this study.  The sound signals collected during cutting 
are shown in Fig. 6.  The amplitude of both signals are at the 
same level, and the difference between signals for two tool 
conditions is not enough to distinguish the worn tool from the 
sharp tool.

Fig.6 Sound signals for sharp (first cut) and worn tool (Fifth) 
test. 
 
After transforming the time domain signals into the 
frequency domain signals, the energy distributions of spectral 
signals for the sharp and worn tool are shown in Fig. 7.  The 
difference of energy distribution between worn tool and sharp 
tool can be easily observed, especially at the frequency from 10 
kHz to 40 kHz.   By considering the energy change over the 
frequency, the amplitude of spectral components for the worn 
tool at around 20 kHz is clearly higher than that for the sharp 
tool condition at the same frequency.  The results show the 
capability of audible sound signal in classifying the tool 
condition.

Tool wear classification 
Signals obtained from four tests were used as the training 
data, and that obtained from the other 3 tests were used in this 
study to verify the system performance.  For each test, 50 
samples were collected during the cutting processes.  The 
signals were normalized before put into the feature selection.  
The classification rates for the system with different size of 
feature bandwidth are shown in table 3 and table 4.   The 
results show that the size of the feature bandwidth and the 
number of features selected for processing affect the system 
significantly.  In consideration of the feature bandwidth size, 
the case with size in 8 kHz shows the higher classification rate 
than the others with the number of selected features lower than 
4, especially compared to the cases with 1kHz size and 2 kHz 
size.  The result follows well with the prediction discussion 
above with the higher value of cost function J.  However, it 
provides the worst classification rate than the others with 5 
selected features.  After investigating the cost function for 
each bandwidth size shown in Fig. 9, the fourth and fifth best 
features in the case with bandwidth size of 8 kHz hold the 
lowest value of J compared to that in the other case with the 
smaller size of feature bandwidth.  It might cause that the 
noise signals closely related to the system variation other than 
tool condition were selected through the selection of the fifth 
features in the 8 kHz case. This seriously leads to the 
misclassification of the tool condition for the system.  The 
situation is also observed in the case with 4 kHz feature 
bandwidth.  In contrast, by investigating the cases with 
smaller bandwidth size of features, the classification rate was 
improved as the number of features selected increases.  For 
the case with the feature bandwidth of 1 kHz, the best 
classification rate was observed with four and five features 
selected for classifier.  It is because the 1 kHz bandwidth is 
not large enough to reduce the effect of the system variation on 
the features.  Therefore, the increase of the number of selected 
features provides the multi-information for the classifier to 
overcome the effect of the system variation and lead to the 
more reliable system. 
The results discussed above suggest that the larger 
bandwidth design for the feature can reduce the effect of the 
noise signal, which comes from the system variation or other 
background noise.  However, the benefit of the large 
bandwidth size will be altered if the signals related to the tool 
wear were covered by the signals not related to the tool 
condition.  By considering the number of selected features, the 
over selection of features will include more noise and lead to 
the reduction of the system performance. 
 Finally, by considering the ratio of the size of total features 
to the selected features, higher than 2.5 provides the good 
results in the case with feature bandwidth of 8 kHz.  On the 
other hand, the ratio higher than 15.5 provides the classification 
rate lower than 70% in the case with bandwidth of 1 kHz.

6.  Please  provide  graphs  for  the  “Tool  wear 
classification”  section  that  shows  how  the  ‘chosen’ 
features were projected  into the Fisher space (y  in your 
paper).  Indicate  how  ‘separable’  the  class  means  are. 
Provide  the  graphs  for  the  top  4  features  mentioned 
under the results section. 
Response: This  is a  very  good  suggest  to us  to put  the 
decision  space  in  the  paper  to  explain  the  feature 
distribution  for  classes.    The  example  in  the  following 
figure can show that we set the X and Y axis for the two 
features  selected,  respectively.    The  selected  data will 
be  the  projected  onto  the  fisher  space  which 
perpendicular  to  the  separation  line.    As  for  the  4 
features, we were working  for obtain  the graph  for  the 
decision  space.    However,  due  to  the  fact  that  our 
student  author  had  graduated  last  Fall, we  need more 
time  to create  the graph with careful verification.    We 
are  sorry  we  can  not  show  it  in  the  paper  at  this 
moment, but we are going to do our best to show  it on 
the  presentation  if  the  paper  can  be  accepted  by  the 
committee.

Reviewer 2:  
The paper presents a development work of using 
sound signal to monitoring and detecting tool 
wear in micro-milling. It is not clear why micro-
milling is special, different from the conventional 
milling, 
Response: In view of signal, the energy level of the 
exciting force is lower than that in the 
conventional milling and the components 
corresponding to the small wear land is lower than 
that level in the conventional cutting.  This leads 
to the low energy signal which is harder to be 
detected and vulnerable to the noise.  In view of 
the sensor installation, there is smaller space for 
sensor installation. In view of the cutting 
environment, the higher restriction of the damage 
on the small cutting feature and higher accuracy 
requirement make the environment better fit to 
the sound signal detection. The address for this 
issue has been added in the page 1 in blue color.  
 
Reviewer 3:  
A well written paper on Sound Based Tool Wear 
Monitoring System for Micro-milling process. To 
improve clarity, authors may want to define 
"worn-out" tool. 
Response: In this report, the 30 um flank wear had 
been defined for worn out tool in Fig.5. This 
address has been added in the page 4.
