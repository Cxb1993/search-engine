1Growth of carbon nanotubes on metallic substrates using a substrate-shielded
microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
Abstract
Aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grown with unprecedentedly high growth
rates on copper and nickel substrates using a microwave plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition system. A simple technique, involving a microwave shield, was
used to prevent the reflection of microwaves from the metallic substrates. In the
mean time, the shield still allows the growth species to reach the substrate or growing
CNTs. There is basically no growth of CNTs when the shield is not used. This is
due to the undesirable interaction between the metals and plasma during the growth.
On the other hand, such a simple use of microwave shielding leads to the growth of
very long aligned CNTs, up to 310 μm, and an unprecedentedly high growth rate of 
62 μm/min.  The key factors that contribute to the enhanced growth are discussed.
The resulting CNTs, exhibiting very high aspect ratios, also show excellent field
emission properties, including a turn-on field (at 10 μA/cm2), a threshold field (at 1
mA/cm2), and a maximum curent density (at 2.12 V/μm) of 1.08 V/μm, 1.31 V/μm, 
27.9 mA/cm2, respectively.

3substrates but allows the growth species to reach the substrate. Similar approaches
were reported for the the growth of single- and double-walled CNTs on Si substrates,
which were partially covered using a shield, and growth rates of 7.2 to 12 m/min
were obtained at a relatively high temperature of 850 ℃.39 In this study, metallic
substrates (Cu and Ni) were used. Using these substrates, we show that the use of a
microwave shield is truly effective in enhancing the CNT growth. The growth of
aligned CNTs having lengths up to 310μm and growth rates as high as 62μm/min are
reported. The length is excellent and the growth rate is unprecedented.
Experimental
CNTs were grown on Ni and Cu substrates using an MPECVD method. The
catalyst used was a Fe-Si thin film prepared by sputter deposition as reported
previously. 20 The deposition time varied from 0.5 min to 7 min in order to obtain
Fe-Si catalyst layers with different thicknesses, ranging from 4 nm to 56 nm. The Si
concentration is approximately 21 atomic %. Selected substrates were pre-deposited
with an Al underlayer also by sputter deposition.20 The Al deposition time varied
from 15 sec to 90 sec. Prior to the CNT growth, the catalyst was etched using
20-torr H2 plasma for 5 min. The growth of CNTs then took place in a
methane/hydrogen mixture (4/9 by volume) at a microwave power of 400 W and a
pressure of 40 torr. The growth time varied from 2 min to 10 min. During the
growth of CNTs, used a shield. The length and microstructure of the resulting CNTs
were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-6701F) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM-2010). Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy microanalysis (EDAX) was used to determine the composition of
catalyst. A micro Raman spectrometer from Renishaw having a He–Ne laser source
with a wavelength of 633 nm was used to determine the quality of CNTs. Field
emission properties were determined by measuring the I–V curves using a Keithley
237 high voltage source measure unit.
Results and discussion
Without the use of a plasma shield, only a few random-oriented CNTs were
occasionally found on the substrate, regardless of the substrate type, catalyst thickness,
and growth condition. With the use of a shield, CNT growth occurs in less than 2
min under all the conditions. Fig. 1 is a montage that shows SEM images and the
lengths of CNTs grown on copper and nickel substrates with the use of a shield. Fe-Si
having various thicknesses was used. The growth time was 5 min. The nominal
lengths (filled circles) of CNTs sparsely found on Cu substrates without the use of a
shield are also given. At all the catalyst thicknesses used, very limited CNTs were
occasionally seen when there was no shield, as shown in the lower-left SEM image in
Fig. 1. On the other hand, the presence of a shield shows great enhancements of the
5larger average diameter of 9.2 nm ± 1.0 nm and consist of 4-6 layers of concentric
graphene sheets. Unlike the CNTs grown on Ni substrate, some of the CNTs grown
on Cu substrate exhibit more defects like bending, as pointed out by solid-line arrow,
and bamboo structure, as pointed out be the dashed-line arrow. The TEM analysis
also shows that the growth of CNT follows the root growth mode, as shown in Fig.
5C. EDAX analysis shows that the catalyst has a composition of 4.3 atomic % Si
and 95.7 atomic % Fe. This is in accordance with previous studies. 16,17,43
The microstructure was further examined using Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 6
shows the Raman spectra of CNTs grown on unshielded and shielded Ni substrates.
The Fe–Si thickness, Al thickness, and growth times were 40 nm, 8 nm, and 3 min,
respectively. The spectra consist of two major peaks representing the D- and G-band,
and a shoulder D’ peak, which is a characteristic peak of CNT.  After deconvolution, 
the ID/IG ratio, G-band position, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the G
band were obtained and are also shown in the figure. CNTs grown on the shielded
substrates apparently have a lower ID/IG ratio than that grown on unshielded substrate
(1.69 vs. 2.38). In both cases, the D-bands appear to be high. It may be to do with
the fast growth rate. However, it is also noted that for CNTs grown on metal
substrates, the D-bands appear to be strong even when the growth rates are lower. 44,45
The former also has a G-band position that is closer to 1580 cm-1 than the latter (1583
cm-1 vs. 1588 cm-1). This indicates that the CNTs grown on shielded substrate are
more graphitic than that grown on unshielded substrate. 46-49 Also, the values of
FWHM for CNTs grown on shielded and unshielded substrates are 51 cm-1 and 53
cm-1, respectively. They are therefore considered to have similar graphite cluster
sizes. CNTs obtained were also characterized for field emission properties. Due to
the length or aspect ratio, excellent field emission properties were obtained using the
CNTs grown on Ni substrate. Fig. 7 shows the I-E curve for CNTs having an
average length of 100  m and a very high aspect ratio of ~14,300. A very good
turn-on field (at 10 μA/cm2) and an excellent threshold field (at 1 mA/cm2) are only
1.08 and 1.31 V/ m, respectively. A very excellent maximum current density of
27.9 mA/cm2 was obtained at an electric field of as low as 2.12 V/ m. In general,
for CNTs grown substrates, the turn-on and threshold fields range from ~0.5 to
greater than ~4.0 and ~1.3 to ~6.5 V/ m, respectively. 22,30,33,36,45,50-57 Also, the
maximum current densities range from ~0.03 to less than 2 mA/cm2 at an electric
fields that are mostly higher than the one reported here. These outstanding filed
emission properties are attributed to the very high aspect ratio as discussed elsewhere.
