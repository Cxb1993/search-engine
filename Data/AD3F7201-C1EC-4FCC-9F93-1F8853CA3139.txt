Abstract 
BACKGROUND. Although cancer statistics indicated that the mortality rates of female breast 
cancer continued to decrease, little knowledge was explored to show if the decrease of mortality 
occurred in all aspects of demographic attributes, histology, and treatment on patients. The 
purpose of this research was two-fold. First, to identify if the survival curves of female 
early-stage breast cancer did improve from 1973 to 2000. Second, to identify if the improvement 
occurs likewise on patients’ characteristics, tumor characteristics, or treatments.  
METHODS. Subjects included 56,132 patients that were at in situ or localized stage in 
1973-1987, and 189,076 patients that were at Stage 0, I, IIA, or IIB in 1988-2000. Subject data 
were from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program between 1973 and 
2000. Survival curves were drawn using Kaplan–Meier estimates. Comparisons on survival 
curves were made by Log rank tests accompanying either a method of pooled over strata or 
pairwise over strata in SPSS software.  
RESULTS. In 1973-1987, the survival curves of early-stage female breast cancer could be 
distinguished into five periods (1973-1981, 1982-1983, 1984, 1985-1986, and 1987), and four 
periods (1988-1990, 1991-1993, 1994-1996, and 1997-2000) in 1988-2000. The latter period had 
a better survival curve than the former one. However, such an overall improvement did not 
happen on young female patients (<=34 years old), African American women (before 1994), and 
patients with histologic types: 8211/3, 8501/2, 8520/2, 8522/3, 8501/3, and 8510/3. 
CONCLUSIONS. This research found a significant improvement for female early-stage breast 
cancer from 1973 to 2000. However, patients with certain ages, race, and histologic types may 
not receive the same improvement. Special medical attentions have to be paid on those patients to 
improve their prognoses. 
 
KEYWORDS: age, histology, race, survival, period, Log rank test. 
 
Measurement of variables 
Year of diagnosis was the most important variable in this study. This research intended to find 
how the survival curves were improved over the years. Based on the results, the following 
variables were considered:  
(1) Age at diagnosis: to identify how the survival curves were improved over the years in 
each age record. The age records were specified in Tables 1 and 2.  
(2) Race: to identify how the survival curves were improved over the years for white 
American women and African American women. 
(3) Stage: to identify how the survival curves were improved over the years for in situ and 
localized stages in 1973-1987, and for Stage 0, Stage I, Stage IIA, and Stage IIB in 
1988-2000. 
(4) Histology: to identify how the survival curves were improved over the years for the 
following histologic types based on the coding system of International Classification of 
Diseases for Oncology: 5 
8010/3: Carcinoma, NOS (No Otherwise Specified) 
8140/3: Adenocarcinoma, NOS 
8141/3: Scirrhous Adenocarcinoma 
8211/3: Tubular Adenocarcinoma 
8480/3: Mucinous adenocarcinoma 
8500/2: Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating, NOS 
8500/3: Infiltrating duct carcinoma, NOS 
8501/2: Comedocarcinoma, noninfiltrating 
8501/3: Comedocarcinoma 
8510/3: Medullary carcinoma, NOS 
8520/2: Lobular carcinoma in situ, NOS 
8520/3: Lobular carcinoma, NOS 
8522/3: Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma 
Note, rare histologic types (each had less than 1% of total cases) and unknown types 
were grouped into an NOS type.  
(5) Topography: to identify how the survival curves were improved over the years for the 
following topography codes based on the coding system of International Classification 
of Diseases (Revision 10): 
C50.1: Central portion of breast 
C50.2: Upper-inner quadrant of breast 
C50.3: Lower-inner quadrant of breast 
C50.4: Upper-outer quadrant of breast 
C50.5: Lower-outer quadrant of breast 
C50.8: Overlapping lesion of breast 
C50.9: Breast, unspecified 
D05.0: Lobular carcinoma in situ 
D05.7: Other carcinoma in situ of breast 
D05.9: Carcinoma in situ of breast, unspecified 
Note, rare topology codes (each had less than 1% of total cases) and unspecified codes 
five survival curves (Figure 1). It is noted that the number without parentheses represents a Log 
rank statistic, whereas the number within parentheses represents a P value in Table 3 and hence 
after. Similarly, four periods, (1) 1988-1990, (2) 1991-1993, (3) 1994-1996, and (4) 1997-2000, 
were formed for 1988-2000. The results of comparison and survival curves were shown in Table 
4, and Figure 2, respectively. The distinguished survival curves indicated an improvement over 
the periods.

periods (1988-2000) 
 
Transition of survival curves in association with periods and other variables  
Though Figures 1 and 2 indicated that survival curves progressed for overall patients over the 
periods. However, survival curves might not progress homogenously in terms of patient or 
treatment characteristics. By comprehensively comparing the survival curves, this research 
obtained the following results. 
 
Age 
By pooled Log rank tests, a summary result was shown in Table 5. Table 5 indicated that the 
survival curves for patients who were 34 years old or younger (15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 
years, and 30-34 years) did not improve in both 1973-1987 and 1988-2000, since the P values in 
those age groups are all larger than 0.05.

Histology 
Table 10 indicated a pooled Log rank test based on histology of breast carcinoma over the periods. 
Based on the results in Table 10, concluding remarks can be made as follows: 
(1) Survival curves improved significantly in both 1973-1987 and 1988-2000: 
 8140/3 (Adenocarcinoma, NOS) 
 8480/3 (Mucinous adenocarcinoma) 
 8500/2 (Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating, NOS) 
 8500/3 (Infiltrating duct carcinoma, NOS) 
 8520/3 (Lobular carcinoma, NOS) 
(2) Survival curves improved insignificantly in both 1973-1987 and 1988-2000:  
 8211/3 (Tubular Adenocarcinoma) 
 8501/2 (Comedocarcinoma, noninfiltrating) 
 8520/2 (Lobular carcinoma in situ, NOS) 
 8522/3 (Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma) 
(3) Survival curves improved significantly in 1973-1987, but insignificantly in 1988-2000: 
 8501/3 (Comedocarcinoma) 
 8510/3 (Medullary carcinoma, NOS) 
It was interesting to find out that the improvement of survival curves of 8501/3 
(Comedocarcinoma) and 8510/3 (Medullary carcinoma, NOS) became insignificant in 1988-2000. 
Additionally, survival curves of 8211/3 (Tubular Adenocarcinoma), 8501/2 (Comedocarcinoma, 
noninfiltrating), 8520/2 (Lobular carcinoma in situ, NOS), and 8522/3 (Infiltrating duct and 
lobular carcinoma) did not improve at all since 1973.

Site specific surgery 
Only codes 10, 20, 40, 50, 58, and 90 of site specific surgery were with larger number of patients 
in SEER data. Since 1998, site specific surgery was no longer used in SEER. However, because 
1997 was the only year in the fourth period (1997-2000) of 1988-2000, the data of 1997 were 
excluded from the analysis. Hence, only three periods (1988-1990, 1991-1993, and 1994-1996) 
were analyzed. The results in Table 12 indicated a significant improvement on survival curves for 
all types of the surgery.

Radiation sequence with surgery 
Table 13 indicated that the survival curves improved since 1973 no matter what types of radiation 
sequences. In other words, the improvement was independent of radiation sequence.
