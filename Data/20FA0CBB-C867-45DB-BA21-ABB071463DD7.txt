(Airbus, 2009; Boeing, 2009). However, the benefit to airlines of such figures is limited, as 
there is a lack of data for specific routes or markets. In addition, most of the academic 
literature focuses on forecasting figures for passengers, cargo or traffic (combining air 
passenger and air cargo) individually. To date, the factors which influence both passenger and 
cargo demand together have not been studied in detail by a quantitative approach.   
In this study, the factors which influence air passenger and cargo demand have been 
identified, evaluated and analyzed in detail by applying back-propagation neural networks. As 
visitors from Japan are Taiwan's primary inbound market segment, and Japan is one of 
Taiwan's major trading partners, the Japan-Taiwan country-pair is chosen for empirical 
analysis. A novel forecasting model that considers the actual air passenger and air cargo 
markets is established in this work, with results that will benefit both air carriers and 
government authorities. 
 
2. Air transport demand forecasting 
A comprehensive review of research on air passenger demand was presented by Jorge-
Calderon (1997). A demand model for scheduled airline services was established for the 
entire network of international European routes in 1989. The estimated model included 
variables describing both the geo-economic characteristics of the area where transportation 
took place and the patterns of airline service, as determined by flight frequency, plane size 
and prices. Brons et al. (2002) collected 37 studies and 204 observations, and indicated that 
air passenger demand is largely determined by the spending capacity of customers. Hsu and 
Wen (1998) used grey theory to develop time series GM(1,1) models for forecasting total 
passenger and 10 country-pair passenger traffic flows in the Asia-Pacific market. In addition, 
Hsu and Wen (2000) later developed a series of models capable of forecasting airline city-pair 
passenger traffic, designing a network of airline routes and determining flight frequencies on 
individual routes were developed by applying grey theory and multi-objective programming.  
More recently, Grosche et al. (2007) presented two gravity models for the estimation of 
air passenger volume between city-pairs. The models include variables describing the general 
economic activity and geographical characteristics of city-pairs instead of variables describing 
air service characteristics. Booking data of flights between Germany and 28 European 
countries were used for calibration, and both models show a good fit to the observed data. 
Kuo et al. (2010) employed artificial neural networks (ANN) to establish a mathematical 
model with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and their results indicate that this model may 
accurately forecast the air transport demand for a network of routes.   
The myriad of factors that influence the choice of airport by freighter-operating airlines 
were identified and evaluated by Gardiner et al. (2005). A number of factors such as night 
curfews, freight forwarders and airport charges were found to be influential, and these were 
examined against a number of dependent variables such as the airline‟s home region and 
operational patterns in order to identify key variations. Ohashi et al. (2005) used air cargo 
traffic flow data to identify the critical factors influencing air cargo transshipment route 
choice decisions. The empirical results showed that the choice of the air cargo transshipment 
hub is more sensitive to time cost than the monetary costs such as landing fees and line-haul 
price. 
Zhang and Zhang (2002) employed a multi-market oligopoly model to examine the 
effect of cargo liberalization on competition between all-cargo carriers and mixed 
passenger/cargo carriers. They suggested that the separation of air cargo and passenger rights 
might be fraught with difficulty in Asia due to the characteristics of its air cargo market, in 
which most passenger carriers have substantial cargo businesses and operate „„combi‟‟ fleets. 
Hong Kong air cargo in the context of both China and the Asia-Pacific region was discussed 
by Zhang (2003), and an oligopoly model was also developed to investigate the effect of an

3. Method and Data 
 
3.1 Back-propagation neural networks 
A neural network consists of an input layer, an output layer, and usually one or more 
hidden layers (Masters, 1993; Haykin, 1999). Each of these layers contains nodes, and these 
are connected to other nodes at adjacent layers. Fig. 1 illustrates a neural network with three 
layers. Each node in a neural network is a processing unit. The output from a given neuron is 
calculated by applying a transfer function to a weighted summation of its input to give an 
output. In this study, the summation function is the weighted summation.

The activity function represents the output of the summation function.

Because the output range of the sigmoid function is between 0 and 1, the mapping of data is 
more suitable. The following simple equation is employed because it is not necessary to 
adjust the data pattern.

where maxX  and minX  are the maximum and minimum of the variables. maxD  (=0.8) and 
minD (=0.1) are the specified maximum and minimum. 
Nodes in the input layer represent independent variables of the problem, including the 
appropriate social and economic parameters. The hidden layer is used to add an internal 
representation of nonlinear data. In general, the number of nodes in the hidden layer is 
determined by the arithmetic or geometric mean of the nodes in the input and output layers. In 
this research, the arithmetic mean was used for fast convergence and stable performance. The 
output of a neural network is the solution to a problem. In this study, the numeric values from 
the output nodes were used to represent air passenger and air cargo volumes. The energy 
function is a verification function which determines if the network energy has converged to its 
minimum. Whenever the energy function approaches zero, the network approaches its 
optimum solution.

Back-propagation network (BPN) is one of the most commonly used supervised ANN 
models. BPN is a layered feed-forward supervised network which is suitable for use in the air 
passenger and air cargo forecasting models presented in this study. A simple MATLAB 
computer program was developed for the neural network model, as shown in Fig. 1. In this 
study, seven widely used criteria: MAE (=MAD), MAPE, SSE, MSE, RMSE, RMSPE, and r 
(Law and Au, 1999), were used to evaluate the forecasting performance of neural networks. 
The measures of forecasting accuracy are listed as follows:

The number of candidate input variables were assigned to be the same for both air 
passenger and air cargo demand. The first six independent variables stand for the variables in 
Japan for air passenger demand and the ones in Taiwan for air cargo demand. For example, 
X1 is population in Japan and X11 is population in Taiwan. The former may be the driving 
force to influence air passenger demand from Japan to Taiwan, while the later may be the 
driving force to influence air cargo demand from Japan to Taiwan. It is well-known that 
economic growth drives air transport demand. Therefore, X6 (Economic growth rate in Japan) 
and X16 (Economic growth rate in Taiwan) were employed. In addition, population and 
employed population were simultaneously used, as were GDP and GNP. These collinear 
variables were used to demonstrate the forecasting performance of artificial neural networks.  
X7 (Foreign exchange rate), X9 (CPI), and X10 (Average hotel rate) were similar with the 
input variables used by Law and Au (1999). Flight movement from Tokyo (NRT) to Taipei 
(TPE) was also employed to represent the most important route connecting the two capitals. 
After market analysis and preliminary evaluation, X17 (Import price index in Taiwan), X18 
(Listed companies in Tokyo), X19 (Gross import amount from Japan to Taiwan), and X20 
(Industrial product in Japan) were also proposed as the candidate input variables for air cargo. 
Gross import amount from Japan to Taiwan includes air and marine freight. The above 20 
factors which may influence air passenger and air cargo demand were identified, evaluated 
and analyzed in detail by applying back-propagation neural networks, as follows.  
 
4. Results and discussion 
The empirical results are discussed in the following four sections. First is air passenger 
demand forecasting, followed by air cargo demand forecasting. Next, the candidate variables 
have been deleted and added to verify their influences. Finally, the hybrid model in which air 
passenger and air cargo are the two dependent variables is presented. 
 
4.1 Air passenger demand forecasting  
This study adapts the data from Table 1 for network training and validation. Considering 
the requirements of the aviation industry, two years may be a reasonable lead time for 
developing an operating strategy.  Among the 10 years‟ sample entries, the first eight rows 
from 1999 to 2006 are selected to form the training set, while the rest are used for forecasting 
accuracy validation. In general, a large sample size is often suggested for training in order to 
obtain sufficient learning. However, the literature offers little guidance in either selecting the 
samples or their sizes. Kuo et al. (2010) employed an ANN model to forecast the air transport 
demand in a network of routes, and their empirical results for eight different cases reveal that 
a small sample size (SSS) is tolerable and acceptable in terms of forecasting performance for 
ANN model.  
The 10 candidate variables in Table 1 are all used for the 10 nodes (X1, X2……X10) in 
the input layer. The output variable (Y1) used in this research is air passengers from Japan to 
Taiwan. Fig. 1 (solid lines) shows a neural network with a hidden layer of six nodes, which is 
used to determine air passenger demand. In this study, six nodes are used for fast convergence 
and stable performance. The energy function vs. iteration loop is shown in Fig. 2. It is seen 
that the present model can achieve a convergent result after the training phase. Fig. 3 provides 
a graphical presentation of the empirical findings with the BPN air passenger demand 
forecasting model. The dotted line is the actual observation and the solid line is the predicted 
value. They are close to each other in spite of the air passenger volume declining due to the 
SARS epidemic in 2003.  
Table 3 shows the experimental results of three training year models and seven criteria. 
Because their values vary case by case and become less referable, the following four criteria 
are not recommended to evaluate forecasting accuracy: Mean Absolute Error (MAE, MAD), 
 8 
volume. The variables in the overlap between the two circles are underlined to indicate that 
they influence both air passenger and air cargo volume. 
X1 (Population in Japan), X3 (PCI in Japan), X4 (GDP in Japan), X5 (GNP in Japan), X7 
(Foreign exchange rate), and X8 (Flight movement from Tokyo to Taipei) only influence air 
passenger volume. X11 (Population in Taiwan), X12 (Employed population in Taiwan), X14 
(GDP in Taiwan), X15 (GNP in Taiwan), X16 (Economic growth rate in Taiwan), X17 (Import 
price index in Taiwan), X18 (Listed companies in Tokyo), and X19 (Gross import amount from 
Japan to Taiwan) only influence air cargo volume. X2 (Employed population in Japan) and 
X13 (PCI in Taiwan) influence both of air passenger and air cargo volumes.  
The candidate variables outside these two circles are the inappropriate independent 
variables, and thus should be excluded. X6 (Economic growth rate in Japan), X9 (CPI in 
Taiwan), X10 (Average hotel rate in Taiwan), and X20 (Industrial product in Japan) are the 
interferences in the BPN model. These variables appear in Fig. 5 with lines through them. 
Although Japan is Taiwan‟s largest source of imports, Taiwan is not Japan‟s primary export 
market. It is thus seen that X6 (Economic growth rate in Japan) and X20 (Industrial product in 
Japan) are not the appropriate input variables in the BPN model. Since PCI in Japan is much 
higher than PCI in Taiwan and business passengers are less sensitive to price, X9 (CPI in 
Taiwan) and X10 (Average hotel rate in Taiwan) do not moderate the number of air passengers 
from Japan to Taiwan.  
 
4.4 Hybrid demand forecasting 
If the 16-9-2 BPN model is used for forecasting air passenger and air cargo demand 
simultaneously, the forecasting accuracy is decreased. It seems that MAPE values for air 
passenger and air cargo demand will increase considerably, as shown in Table 6. The factors 
in the left half-moon in Fig. 5, namely X1, X3, X4, X5, X7, and X8, show no influence on air 
cargo demand. Instead, they become interferences in the present hybrid model. The same is 
true for the factors in the right half-moon in Fig. 5 for air passenger demand. Therefore, the 
forecasting accuracy is decreased. 
A contribution graph (Gately, 1996) is also used to study the influence of a processing 
unit in the input layer. The contribution of an input variable is the sum of absolute values of 
the weighting connected to every node in the hidden layer ( 
k
j ij
W
1
). To evaluate the 
influences of input variables, the scale developed by Gately (1996) is used. Any input variable 
with a contribution of less than 2 has weak influence, while one with a contribution greater 
than 5 has a significant influence.  
Table 7 shows the contributions of input variables for three models: air passenger, air 
cargo, and hybrid (forecasting air passenger and air cargo simultaneously). X8 (Flight 
movement from Tokyo to Taipei), X13 (PCI in Taiwan), and X7 (Foreign exchange rate) are 
the three most important factors for air passenger demand forecasting. X16 (Economic growth 
rate in Taiwan) is the most important factor for air cargo demand forecasting. These important 
input variables are in boldface type in Table 7 and Fig. 5. In addition, the variables 
influencing both air passenger and air cargo volume are underlined in Table 7 and Fig. 5. The 
interferences appear in Table 7 and Fig. 5 with lines thorough them. 
It is noteworthy that the results from Tables 4 and 5 obtained by deleting and adding 
candidate variables are similar to that from Table 7 attained with the use of a contribution 
graph. For example, if X8 (Flight movement from Tokyo to Taipei) is excluded in the BPN 
model, forecasting accuracy would decrease most severely, as shown in Table 4 
(MAPE=5.20%). Also, its contribution (=8.27) is highest, as shown in Table 7. However, few 
conclusions can be drawn by comparing the hybrid model (forecasting air passenger and air 
 10 
forecast air transport demand, and the data thus obtained can be a good reference for both air 
carriers and government authorities.  
In the present study, only official annual numerical data were selected to be the candidate 
variables. Dummy variables were not used, and political effects were not considered. In 
addition, air fare and oil price were not included in the present model. The results show that 
forecasting air cargo demand is more difficult than forecasting air passenger demand. This is 
mainly because the present model only considers a single country-pair. Moreover, the 
unbalanced air cargo flow in the global supply chain is more complicated than air passenger 
flow. One possibility for future study could be to include other input variables to improve 
forecasting accuracy for air cargo demand. The other country-pair, city pair or route may be 
selected to further validate the BPN model. In addition, a forecasting model using seasonal or 
monthly data would be valuable if the data are available.  
Future research could be conducted to forecast air cargo demand in a global routes 
network using back-propagation neural networks. After evaluating the international air cargo 
network structures, several major air cargo hubs may be selected (Matsumoto, 2007). The 
output variables may be the air cargo volumes, including import, export, transit and 
transshipment. The social and economic parameters in each hub, country or region are the 
candidate input variables. It is supposed that air cargo demand may be more accurately 
forecasted in a global routes network (Kuo et al., 2010), and that many fruitful results could 
be obtained if the elaborate model is established. 
In addition, Song and Li (2008) reviewed the published studies on tourism demand 
modelling and forecasting from 2000 to 2007 and suggested that integrating both qualitative 
and quantitative forecasting approaches may improve forecasting accuracy. Future research 
thus can try to quantify the qualitative variables in the application of the BPN model. 
Moreover, the potential effects of crises, disasters and other events on air transport demand 
may be further analyzed based on appropriate scenario analysis. It is believed that these 
efforts may make the present BPN model both more powerful and applicable.

本計劃主要目的在以類神經網路建構日本來台航空客運與航空貨運需求預測模式，透過回
顧相關文獻、市場分析與初步評估，決定候選輸入變數，再以類神經網路深入分析其影響
程度。實證結果顯示此創新之航空客、貨運量預測模式具高精確度之預測能力，預測日本
來台航空客運量之平均絕對百分誤差(Mean Absolute Percentage Error, MAPE)為 0.34%，
預測日本來台貨運量之 MAPE 為 7.74%。所有結果皆符合原計畫之預期目標，同時計劃書中
所列之工作項目均已順利完成。本人參加 99年 7 月 11 日至 15 日於葡萄牙里斯本舉行之
12th World Conference on Transport Research 國際學術研討會，口頭發表本計劃之成
果。並已修改論文，投稿 Transportation Planning and Technology 國際學術期刊(SCI, 
SSCI, EI)。研究結果具學術與實務價值外，亦可提供主管機關制定政策參考。
