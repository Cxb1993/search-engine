by moving loads can be significantly higher than the deformation created by static loads. The 
problem of moving loads on elastic structures also arises in many modern machining operations 
such as ballistic machining and high-speed precision drilling. Because of the extreme position 
accuracy required in many of these machining operations, the dynamic behavior of the elastic 
structures becomes critical in maintaining the machine’s performance [1]. 
In the analysis of frame vibration induced by moving loads, two characteristics must be 
considered: the structural mass is distributed along beam members in the frame, not concentrated 
on some particular points; the load is traveling along the length of beam members, not acting on 
some fixed points. When using the finite element method to analyze the vibration of elastic 
frames, the frame mass is approximated either by the lumped mass method or the consistent mass 
method. To calculate the time-history response of the frames, the decoupled equations of motion 
for the vibration amplitudes of natural modes are usually solved either by the approximate 
numerical methods or by assuming that the input load is linearly varied in a time interval. To 
reduce errors created by the discrete coordinates in space and time, the beam members must be 
divided into a lot of beam elements and the time intervals have to be very small, which will 
increase the computation effort. 
To avoid using the discrete coordinates, the behavior of vibration induced by moving loads 
can only be studied in a simple model such as simple-supported beams [2, 3]. Wu and Dai [4] 
applied the transfer matrix method to study the vibration of multi-span continuous beams due to 
moving loads, but it still assumed that the exciting force is linearly varied with time in a small 
interval. Wang and Lin [5] presented a transfer matrix method to analyze the dynamic response 
of multi-span Timoshenko frames induced by moving loads, but it required the same span length 
and the same column height for all spans. 
From the differential equation of beam vibration, the relationships between harmonic forces 
and displacements at the ends of a beam member can be exactly established. These relations are 
usually referred to as the dynamic stiffness matrix of beam members. The elements in the 
dynamic stiffness matrix are nonlinear functions, trigonometric and hyperbolic, of vibration 
frequency. The dynamic stiffness matrix of the whole structure which is an assemblage of beam 
members can be formed by the direct-stiffness method. Theoretically, the structural degrees of 
freedom are infinite when using the dynamic stiffness matrix method. The dynamic stiffness 
matrix, which is frequency-dependent, can be directly employed in solving the steady-state 
response of the frames subjected to harmonic loadings. To solve the problems of transient 
response, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the frames must be first calculated from the 
dynamic stiffness matrix. The calculation is usually referred to as a nonlinear eigenproblem and 
is different from the linear eigenproblem encountered in the dynamic analysis of discrete systems.

and  is the displacement vector for the joints at which the beam elements are connected. The

4. Numerical examples 
4.1. Example 1 - multi-span step beam 
Adopted from reference [4], the multi-span step beam shown in Fig. 2 consists of five 
Bernoulli-Euler beam segments and is subjected to a moving load of . Each 
segment has different span length, sectional properties and density, which are listed in Table 1, 
but has the same Young’s modulus . Natural frequencies and mode shapes 
of the first five modes are shown in Fig. 3. Time-history analyses were carried out by using the 
first five modes. The transverse displacements and bending moments at the midpoint c of the 
step beam are plotted in Fig. 4 as functions of the load position for two different moving 
velocities,  and , which shows that the responses caused by the two 
different velocities have the similar tendency, but the higher moving velocity may create larger 
high-frequency flutter.

the square frame. The mode 1 has frequency Hz461.01 =f  and wave length m201 =λ  as 
shown in Fig. 11(a). To create the mode-1 resonance, the space of the loads is 20m and the speed 
of the load is m/s2.911 ≈= λfvc  as depicted in Fig. 12(a) where, although three loads are shown 
in the length of 40m, the first load and the third load refer to the same moving load and only two 
loads are moving around the frame. The time history of transverse displacement at the midpoint 
of element 1-2 is plotted in Fig. 12(b) which shows the amplitude of vibration increases with 
time. The deformation shapes of the square frame at time 18.48s and time 19.56s are shown in 
Figs. 12(c) and 12(d), which are very similar the deformation shape of mode 1. 
The mode 4 has frequency Hz980.04 =f  and length of deformed pattern m104 =λ  as 
shown in Fig. 11(d). To create the mode-4 resonance, the space of the loads is 10m and the speed 
of the load is m/s0.144 ≈= λfvc  as depicted in Fig. 13(a) where, although five loads are shown 
in the length of 40m, the first load and the fifth load refer to the same moving load and only four 
loads are moving around the frame. The time history of transverse displacement at the midpoint 
of element 1-2 is plotted in Fig. 13(b) which shows the amplitude of vibration increases with 
time. The deformation shapes of the square frame at time 18.00s and time 18.50s are shown in 
Figs. 13(c) and 13(d), which are very similar the deformation shape of mode 4. 
The mode 5 has frequency Hz74.15 =f  and wave length m105 =λ  as shown in Fig. 
11(e). To create the mode-5 resonance, the space of the loads is 10m and the speed of the load is 
m/s5.1755 ≈= λfvc  as depicted in Fig. 14(a) where, although five loads are shown in the length 
of 40m, the first load and the fifth load refer to the same moving load and only four loads are 
moving around the frame. The time history of transverse displacement at the quarter point of 
element 1-2 is plotted in Fig. 14(b) which shows the amplitude of vibration increases with time. 
The deformation shapes of the square frame at time 11.46s and time 11.75s are shown in Figs. 
14(c) and 14(d), which are very similar the deformation shape of mode 5. 
The mode 8 has frequency Hz46.28 =f  and length of deformed pattern m208 =λ  as 
shown in Fig. 11(h), based on which the spaces of the loads, depicted in Fig. 15(a), are set so that 
the mode-8 resonance can be created. The speed of the load is m/s4988 ≈= λfvc . Although five 
loads are shown in the length of 40m, the first load and the fifth load refer to the same moving 
load and only four loads are moving around the frame. The time history of transverse 
displacement at the quarter point of element 1-2 is plotted in Fig. 15(b) which shows the 
amplitude of vibration increases with time. The deformation shapes of the square frame at time 
7.56s and time 7.76s are shown in Figs. 15(c) and 15(d), which are very similar the deformation 
shape of mode 8. 
The mode 9 has frequency Hz61.39 =f  and wave length m3/209 =λ  as shown in Fig. 
11(i). To create the mode-9 resonance, the space of the loads is 20/3m and the speed of the load 
 10
arrangement of load distance and moving speed may cause resonance of the frame in some 
natural modes.
