1. Introduction 
  
According to the WHO, in developing and transitional countries alone, some 16 thousand million injections are 
administered each year. Speedy injections in fact obscure many dangers and harms. Studies show: the usage of 
syringes that are not sterilized or are contaminated have caused the transmission of many diseases. Furthermore, 
studies show that unsafe and unnecessary injections should be decreased (Hutin, 2003). 
 
The annual occurrence rate of needle-stick injuries for medical personnel is approximately 23%~71% 
(Leliopoulou, 1999). Many health workers are infected due to needle-stick injuries. There are many reasons that 
cause medical personnel needle-stick injuries; studies show that nearly 65% of all medical personnel have been 
pricked or cut by needles. The needles primarily come from: injection needles, stitching needles, and scalpels 
(Rattner, 1994). Full-time direct patient care occupations have greater risk of injury compared to part-time and 
casual workers within the health care sector (Alamgir, 2008). Additionally, work procedures also influence the 
rate of needle-stick injuries of medical personnel. IV-catheters, blood transfusions, and blood extractions are the 
top three most likely for needle-stick injuries (Lee, 2001). For medical personnel in Taiwan, needle-stick injuries 
mostly occur due to injection needles, at approximately 55.3%; 21.3% are injured due to recapping of needles 
(Hung, 1999). In addition, a significant number of sharps injuries accidents were not being reported. Research 
pointed out that safety-engineered devices are likely to be effective at injury reduction (Elder, 2006). 
 
The International Sharps Injury Prevention Society (ISIPS) has proactively pushed for legislation in various 
countries of the world in hopes of replacing traditional syringes with safety syringes. The United States passed 
the “Needle-Stick Safety and Prevention Act” in November 2000, and began to promote the full usage of safety 
syringes in hospitals in 2005. WHO also hopes that its member countries will follow suit. Studies also show that 
medical personnel are more interested in purchasing safety syringes with protection and lock functions 
(Woodside, 1998). Therefore, many companies have devoted themselves to the design and development of safety 
syringe. 
 
In the world, the reuse of medical waste has been long in practice, resulting in the prevalent abuse of needles, 
indirectly causing the continued rise of AIDS infections in those areas. In 2000, contaminated injections caused 
an estimated 21 million HBV infections, two million HCV infections and 260,000 HIV infections, accounting for 
32%, 40% and 5%, respectively, of new infections for a burden of 9,177,679 disability-adjusted life years 
between 2000 and 2030 (Hauri, 2004). Therefore, un-reusability will be a significant issue in safety syringe 
design. WHO requires its member countries and sponsors to immediately begin using safety syringes with 
self-destruct mechanisms, and to eliminate traditional syringes in all vaccinations and inoculations. 
 
In the practice use of safety syringes, these not only replace traditional syringes and prefilled syringes (such as 
insulin for diabetic patients), but are also applied in needles for medical use such as IV infusion needles, vacuum 
tubes, and lancets (often used by diabetic patients to test blood sugar levels). However, existing so-called safety 
syringes are primarily still hypodermic needles. Existing safety syringes on the market are manual; even though

2.3 Procedures 
 
The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate the new safety syringe (Type III). The author conducted a 
patent search in the USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database, in order to summarize the most representative 
single-use safety syringe type. Then, this study invited six senior professional medical personnel (including 
usage experts) who have an average of over 11 years of experience to conduct Focus Group Interviews (FGI), in 
order to ascertain the designs for the new safety syringes. 
 
In order to explore characteristics of the existing safety syringes, this study used Focus Group Interviews to 
conduct research. Many highly professional issues are suitable for research via Focus Group Interviews 
(DePasquale, 1999; Prince, 2004). This method forms groups surrounding specific issues or populations to 
conduct data collection. The advantages are: it is easy to elicit interaction, broader issues can be discussed, and it 
is possible to have in-depth understanding of actual conditions of the research subject. The utilization of Focus 
Group Interviews can allow the researcher to understand viewpoints of different populations, and can be applied 
in investigating the latent views on new projects, services, or product designs (Bruseberg, 2001). 
 
In FGI, six senior professional medical personnel (including usage experts) have two important tasks: (1) 
propose suggestions on how to avoid needle-stick injuries (the author uses Dematal for further analysis in this 
portion) and (2) propose expert opinions on Type I and Type II. 
 
Dematal uses a two-dimensional matrix to understand the correlation among all elements within a system, and 
ultimately produces a multilevel structural hierarchy (Warfield, 1977). The author can use results of Dematal to 
determine design guidelines, and then allow 3 industrial designers to complete the new safety syringe design. 
 
After completing the safety syringe design, the author selects and ascertains the 98 test subjects. The subjects 
need to fill out experiment consent forms and basic data forms. After explaining the experiment and practicing, 
the two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1: primarily tests for medicine extraction speed of users in 
using the safety syringe (to extract at least 1cc of medicine from a vial with an 8mm diameter); Experiment 2: 
conduct safety evaluation for safety syringes (use Training for Development of Innovative Control Technology 
Project, TDICT) with Safety Feature Evaluation Form (SFEF) as the evaluation scale. The experimental 
procedures for the design and evaluation of new safety syringes are as shown in Figure 2. 
 
3. Results 
 
Results of this study are divided into two portions: Safety Syringe Design and Safety Feature Evaluation, which 
 5
principle of “avoid recapping” can be met, medical personnel can avoid the danger of needle-stick injuries. 
 
3.1.3 Completion of design of outward-pushing safety syringe  
 
With the important design directive of “avoid recapping,” this study uses the Expert Opinion method (Ozer, 1999) 
to assemble 3 industrial designers for the new design of safety syringes. With expert suggestions, the key points 
for design of the new safety syringe include: 
(1) It should be designed based on traditional syringes, without too many new functions. 
(2) In operation, there should not be too many new actions required to operate the safety mechanisms. 
(3) It should avoid contradicting original operational habits and postures. 
(4) Activation and deactivation of safety mechanism should have clear feedback. 
(5) The likelihood for accidental triggering of safety mechanism should be lowered. 
(6) The form of safety syringe and location of its mechanisms should consider the psychological security of the 
user. 
(7) The used needle should avoid any likelihood of protruding from the barrel (regardless of poked through or 
fell out). 
 
After ascertaining the design plan, 3 industrial designers helped to finish the design for the new safety syringe. 
The design has acquired patent rights in Taiwan (Chang, 2006), whereas patent rights are in the process of 
application in the United States and Japan. The new safety syringe is comprised of: an outer barrel, a needle hub, 
an inner barrel, and a plunger, as shown in Figure 4. Of which, needle hub and plunger are completely the same 
as traditional syringes. Design of the new safety syringe adds teeth-like structures on the outer edge of traditional 
syringe barrels (this portion is the inner barrel). Additionally, an outer barrel is placed on the outer edge of the 
inner barrel, and inside the outer barrel there are also teeth-like structures to match the ones on the outer edge of 
the inner barrel. This structure can only move in one direction. After using the syringe, the user can pull the outer 
barrel outward to the end, which then fully covers the needle, thereby meeting the “unreusable” safety syringe 
design standard of the WHO. The operational method of outward-pushing safety syringe is shown in Figure 5. 
 
3.2 Safety Feature Evaluation  
 
After completing design of the new safety syringe, the author conducts Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 for Type 
I, Type II, and Type III (new safety syringe). 
 
3.2.1 Experiment 1: tests for medicine extraction speed of users in using the safety syringe  
 
Experiment 1 primarily tests for medicine extraction speed of users in using the safety syringe; Experiment 1 
results are as shown in Table 2. Table 2 shows, the operation times for regular syringes are clearly the shortest, 
meaning most subjects are still more familiar with traditional syringes. In terms of safety syringe, syringe 
operation time is best for Type III, followed by Type I and Type II. This study uses One Way ANOVA to analyze 
 7
(2) In SFEF, Type III had the highest total score with 66.81; Type I was second with total score of 62.22; Type II 
had the lowest total score with 59.77. In the 17 evaluation indicators, the outward-pushing safety syringe scored 
better in 12 indicators than Type I and Type II (7 of which reached significant levels of difference). Overall, Type 
III has greater usage safety satisfaction. 
(3) In SFEF, scores of all three syringes do not surpass 4 points for questions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, and 16. These 
questions are less likely to directly affect safety of medical personnel in using safety syringes; in design of safety 
syringes they also tend to be overlooked. 
(4) In SFEF, 7 questions for Type III received scores over 4 points (questions 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17). 
Especially in the stage of “Training,” Type III has breakthrough scores in questions 15 and 17. This shows that 
Type III requires no training for correct usage, and it is easy to not miss any important steps in use. 
 
Advantages of the newly designed safety syringes are as follows: (1) since structure of the newly designed safety 
syringe is simple, production costs are low, commensurate with its disposability. (2) Since the teeth-like 
structures can only move in one direction, the syringe must be disposed after a single instance of use, which fully 
conforms to the WHO’s stipulation of “avoid repeat usage.” (3) The action of pulling the outer barrel outward 
forces the user to have no chance of recapping, thus there is no chance of needle-stick injuries for the user. (4) 
Design of the new safety syringe is nearly the same as that of traditional syringes in terms of usage, thus the user 
would not need to learn any new techniques. 
 
This study uses FGI and SFEF to find existing problems of Type I and Type II safety syringes, and conducts 
design and evaluation. Although the usage safety of Type I and Type II safety syringes is higher for medical 
personnel in comparison to traditional syringes, there are still many usage problems to be overcome. Even 
though the new safety syringe is better than Type I and Type II in terms of usage, its volume after use is too large, 
and has the disadvantage of not decreasing the volume of garbage. The result of this study provides safer and 
more usable safety syringes, the effect of which offers concrete and significant benefits for needle safety and 
prevention of disease. The new safety syringes meet the latest regulations by the WHO on safety syringes, and 
will be able to effectively lower the instances of medical personnel needle-stick injuries.

A disposable syringe after one time usage includes an outer tube having 
an inner teeth set formed on the inner wall of the outer tube and an 
inner tube having an outer teeth set formed on the outer wall of the 
inner tube and a safety guide.  The inner teeth set of the outer tube 
meshes with the outer teeth set of the inner tube.  The single direction 
design of the teeth sets allows the outer tube to be pulled away from 
the inner tube, but not to be pushed back.  The pulling force of the 
outer tube will pull the safety guide to form a damaged groove and the 
outer tube is adapted to enclose a needle so that the needle is not 
exposed outwardly, which prevents the needle from poking people 
accidentally.  The syringe is unable to be reused.
