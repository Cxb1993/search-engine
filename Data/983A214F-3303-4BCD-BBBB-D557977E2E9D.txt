Abstract 
 
Verifiability is essential for a secret sharing 
approach which allows the involved participants to 
detect cheaters during the secret retrieval process. In 
this article, we propose a verifiable secret image 
sharing scheme that can not only resist dishonest 
participants but can also satisfy the requirements of 
lossless and camouflage. The new approach conceals 
the shadows into a pixel pair of the host image by 
adding or subtracting a pixel value by 1. Consequently, 
the embedding alteration can be reduced to preserve 
the fidelity of the shadow image. Recoverability is a 
practical essential for protecting the valuable host 
image from being distorted. After the authorized 
participants retrieve a lossless secret image, they can 
remove the shadows from the shadow images to 
recover the unmarked host image. The experimental 
results exhibit that the proposed scheme can share a 
large secret capacity according to the threshold t and 
retain superior quality of around 52 dB.

1. Introduction 
 
The purpose of secret sharing is to distribute a 
secret key among involved participants in order to 
reduce the risk of lost, distorted, and stolen [1-3]. The 
concept of the (t, n)-threshold secret sharing system 
was first introduced by Blakely [1] and Shamir [2] in 
1979. To share the secret, a dealer first encodes and 
divides the secret into n shadows. Then, the shadows 
are distributed to the involved participants. With any t 
out of n shadows, authorized participants can 
cooperate to retrieve the secret. 
A critical assumption in the (t, n)-threshold secret 
sharing mechanism is that all shadows must be genuine 
and provided by honest participants during the secret 
retrieval process. Tompa and Woll [4] prove that 
Shamir’s scheme is insecure and incapable of 
preventing fraudulent participants. A cheater may 
provide a fake shadow and can collect other genuine 
shadows during cooperation. The cheater with a 
sufficient number of genuine shadows can later restore 
the secret. 
In order to overcome this potential attack, a 
verifiable sharing approach [5] has been proposed to 
confirm the shadow validity of the participants during 
cooperation. The schemes [6-8] conceal a shared 
shadow and a verification bit into a 22 block of a host 
image. The involved participants can verify the 
shadows by a parity check. To satisfy the 
steganography of shadows, the schemes [6-9] embed 
noise-like shadows into host images to form the 
shadow images. The perception of the shadow image is 
meaningful and therefore can reduce attention from 
malicious intruders. Hence, the quality of the shadow 
images is an important essential for evaluating an 
efficient sharing approach. The fidelities of the shadow 
image are around 34 dB to 40 dB [6-9]. 
The retrieved secret image is distorted due to 
truncation of the gray-scale values [6, 9]. To share a 
lossless secret image, the schemes [5, 8] used two 
pixels to represent the exceeding gray values. 
Nevertheless, this results in the expansion of the secret 
image and may reduce the shared capacity as well as 
distort the quality of the shadow image. Another 
concern for secret image sharing is the maximum 
shared capacity of the secret image. Since these

share (t2) secret digits into a pair of O. Let the shared 
two secret digits be 3 and 4, the verification bit v = 1, 
and the pixel pair (g1, g2) be (7, 5). The value of m can 
be computed by m = M(7, 5) = 2 by Equation (2). Thus, 
F(x) can be formulated as F(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x2 +4x3) 
mod 5. Assume that the secret keys K1 = 1, K2 = 2, K3 
= 3, and K4 = 4. By Equation (4), the four shadows can 
be derived as y1 = F(1) = 0, y2 = F(2) = 4, y3 = F(3) = 2, 
and y4 = F(4) = 3. 
 
Camouflage Phase 
The derived n shadows yi’s are meaningless. To 
achieve the purposes of steganography, the dealer 
embeds the n shadows into the pixel pair (g1, g2) of the 
host image to generate n shadow pairs. That is, the n 
camouflaged shadow pixels for each participant are 
meaningful and visually similar to the original pixel 
pair.  
From the located pair (g1, g2) at matrix M, the value 
of m is mutually different from its four neighbors in 
the up, down, left, and right directions. The dealer can 
derive the new shadow pair (g1i, g2i) by adjusting the 
corresponding shadow yi at the row g1i and the column 
g2i for the four neighbors of (g1, g2). The adjustment 
manner is as follows:  
Step 1: Calculate the different value d of yi as 
 d = (yi  m) mod 5. (5) 
Step 2: Generate the embedded shadow pair (g1i, g2i) 
for yi according to the four directions. If d = 0, the 
generated shadow pair (g1i, g2i) = (g1, g2). Otherwise, 
derive the shadow pair (g1i, g2i) by the following 
formula:


	

	
 2 if,1
2 if,1
55 dgg
dgg
dd
dd . (6) 
For example, for the (g1, g2) = (7, 5) and derived 
shadow y1 = 0, the value d = 3 by Equation (5). Since d 
 0 and d > 2, the value of pixel g2 = g21 = 5-1 = 4 by 
Equation (6). That is, the shadow pair is (7, 4). In the 
same manner, we can learn the shadow pairs (7, 6), (7, 
4), and (8, 5) for y2 = 4, y3 = 2, and y4 = 3, respectively. 
By repeating the shadow derivation and camouflage 
phases, the dealer can generate and camouflage all 
secret shadows into the host pairs in order to obtain n 
shadow images Oi’s. Then, the dealer can distribute the 
meaningful shadow image Oi and the key Ki to the 
involved participants. 
 
2.2. Verification and Retrieval Procedure 
 
Given any t out of n shadow images Ôj’s and the 
keys Kj’s from the involved participants. The 
participants can mutually verify the accuracy of the 
provided shadow images. That is, they can detect 
whether any dishonest participants exist. Then, the 
authorized participants can cooperate to reconstruct the 
lossless secret image S and the host image O, where j = 
1, 2, …, t.  
The processes of verifying the shadow image Ôj 
and restoring the S and O are described in the 
following phases. 
 
Preliminary Phase 
Step 1: Generate the verification stream V={vi | i = 1, 
2, …, HW/2} in a five-ary notational system by the 
dealer’s secret key K. 
Step 2: Derive the magic matrix M with HW 
elements by the weighted sum function [11] for 0  g1 
< W, and 0  g2 < H.  
 M(g1, g2) = (g1 + 2  g2) mod 5. (7) 
Step 3: Group the shadow images Ôj into pixel pairs 
where j = 1, 2, …, t.  
Assume that v is the verification digit of V, and the 
pixle pair (1j, 2j) is the corresponding pixel pair of Ôj, 
where j = 1, 2, …, t. 
 
Verification and Reconstruction Phase 
Step 1: Compute the value j by mapping the row 1j 
and column 2j at a magic matrix M, where 
 j = M(1j, 2j). (8) 
Step 2: Derive a (t1)-degree polynomial F(x) by 
Lagrange’s interpolation formula with t shadows j’s 
and secret keys Kj’s:  
 )(ˆ xF = ( vˆ  + mˆ x + 1x2 +…+t-2xt-1) mod 5. (11) 
Step 3: Compare the value of verification digit v with 
the value of vˆ  from )0(Fˆ . If v  vˆ , then the shadow 
images are counterfeit; terminate the retrieval 
procedure. Otherwise, the provided shadow images are 
valid; follow the next steps.  
Step 4: Learn the secret digits s1, s2, …, st2 by 
extracting the last (t2) coefficients of )(ˆ xF . Here, 
sk= k, for k=1, 2, …, t2. 
Step 5: Obtain the feature value m at the second 
coefficient of )(ˆ xF , where m = mˆ . 
Step 6: Restore the original pixel pair (g1j, g2j) by 
selecting the row g1j and the column g2j, which is 
corresponding to the element value m at the same 
location of magic matrix M. 
Step 7: Repeat the above steps until all shadow pairs 
have been processed, where j = 1, 2, …, t. 
Finally, the authorized participants can not only 
obtain the secret image S losslessly but can also restore 
the host image O by rearranging all extracted secret 
digits and pixel pairs, respectively.

Figure 4. The secret capacity with different t 
 
Without loss of generality, if the PSNR value is less 
than 35 dB, then some important signal characteristics 
may be lost. While the PSNR value is less than 30 dB, 
the quality is unacceptable. In other words, it is 
difficult for people to distinguish the original image 
from the shadow image when the PSNR value is larger 
than 35 dB. Figure 3 illustrates the shadow image 
qualities of the test images. The PSNR values are 
approximate to 52 dB for various types of images. This 
indicates that the fidelity of the shadow images is 
approximate to that of the original images after the 
camouflage process.

3.2. Comparison 
 
The shared secret capacity of the proposed (t, n)-
threshold sharing approach can be increased according 
to factor t. Table 1 lists the capacities and the qualities 
of the shadow images with different t settings. Since 
we embed (t2) secret digits into each pixel pair, the 
maximum capacity of the secret is (HW)/2(t-2) 
digits, which equals HW(t2) bits. Here, a digit in 
the five-ary notational system equals two bits in the 
binary notational system. No matter how much the 
secret capacity is increased, the quality of the shadow 
images remains around 52 dB. Hence, the new scheme 
can achieve the essentials of both capacity and fidelity. 
Figure 4 compares the capacity for sharing methods 
and the proposed scheme. The capacity of the shared 
secret [6-8] is fixed at HW2 bits. For the situation of 
t  3, the capacities of [6-8] are better than the 
proposed scheme. By increasing the setting t > 3, we 
can observe that the new scheme can share 
significantly more secret data than related schemes.
