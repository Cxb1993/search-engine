Abstract 
Based on the Adleman-Lipton’s molecular 
computing model and Reif’s Recombinant DNA 
(RDNA ） Model, this project focused on 
providing a molecular solution to construct a 
platform for advanced data analyses. We 
proposed a DNA-computing based scheme for 
advanced database application. The practice of 
DNA computing has grown significantly in 
solving the number of difficult problems. Three 
subjects are suggested in this proposal. (1) A new 
data structure presented by DNA strands is 
presented. The strands are designed as several 
segments according to the RDNA model and the 
identical content of each segment is defined. (2) 
Multi-layer DNA-based database model is 
proposed. It contains a scheme for an optimal 
solution for 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack 
Problem (0-1 MKP). (3) A series of parallel 
DNA algorithms are designed based on the 
speciation of our proposed model. In summary, 
by taking the advantage of vast parallelism 
inherent in DNA Computing, one SCI journal 
paper has been accepted. Two EI journal and one 
conference papers have been published within 
this one year research. 
 
Keywords: DNA computing；DNA encoding；

前言 
隨著科技的進步，對於資料的處理與分析
對於各研究單位與組織企業營運的影響愈來
愈重要。而針對資料分析的範疇，亦從商業智
慧的應用到生物醫學等領域，不斷地發展出不
同的應用，以提供多方面議題之解決方案。在
資料分析中，「查詢」處理是最常用的功能，
而查詢的本質即是篩選，因此若以DNA計算之
大量平行處理特性考量，則恰好適用於查詢處
理之特質。故，若能將資料以及資料處理中常
用功能，對DNA計算能處理之方式做設計，將
其應用於複雜之大量資料的分析處理，實為一
DNA平行計算之重要應用。 
 
研究目的 
使用 DNA 計算之平行計算及高儲存能力
的特性是 DNA 計算的優點。這兩大特性目前
庫與簡易分群分析之 DNA 計算模式之雛型
及對應之 DNA 程序。其步驟包含下列(1)提
出一 DNA 計算模式架構，其有較低複雜度
的運算，可快速的解決複雜的查詢問題。(2)
進一歩模擬以進行所提出模式之驗證。(3)並
且在驗證之同時，設計更低的計算時間複雜
度的 DNA 程序。以下，針對研究之資料庫
設計加以描述內容。 
(1) 處理資料之分析:依據本研究所設計
的模式，定義出了以下的資料結構分析。將
常用的資料結構用 DNA 索加以定義。例如，
資料數字型態的資料以二進位方式設計，而
有關字串的資料，則將資料庫中大量使用的
字串，事先做設定，例如某些鹹基代表 A~Z
間的字母。日期格式則是以多個 bit 來代表
年、月、日。在以往，DNA Computing 大部
分被用來解複雜的 NP 系列之數字問題，本
研究則將此計算擴展到不同資料形式之表
現。 
 4
(2) 以 DNA 索為基礎之資料設計:由於本
DNA 計算資料庫是以關聯式資料庫為基礎
所設計，而關聯式資料庫模式包含二大基本
要素，資料結構與資料運算；因此，針對本
模式所處理的資料結構內容，我們提出的
DNA 索之位元表示方式之設計理念，用 m×n
條單索代表 n 個二進位數。每個位元（bit）
設計為 10mer 長度的 DNA 索，並且利用
sticker model 的設計原理將 strand 定義成多
個 區 段 。 另 外 ， 設 定
Σ={A1,A2,…,An,B1,B2,…,Bm, 1A , 2A ,… nA , 1B , 
2B ,…, mB , kP , 0C , 1C , 0D , 1D , 1 , 0 , # }，其中
A1,A2,…, An 代表所定義變數，B1,A2,…, Bm
代表一個二進位數的位元位置。因此，我們
可以用上述符號來定義一條單索 Si,j。因此，
依據關聯式資料庫以欄位做為處理的單位，
一組完整設計過的欄位所成的集合就構成一
筆紀錄，試管 T 即為所有記錄的資料表。 
在資料運算方面，本模式之設計以關聯式代
數為主。一般資料運算分為原始運算子與非
原始運算子。原始運算子包括：1.乘積運算
（Cartesian Product）、2.聯集運算（Union）、
3.差集運算（Difference）、4.選擇運算
（Select）、5.投影運算（Project）、6.交集運
算（Intersection）、7.合併運算（Join）。依據
常用的資料類型，一般區分為文字、整數字、
布林值、日期等四類。其中，若是布林資料，
則使用一個位元表示；對每一個大量使用的
字串，事先定義其意義，並使用一個位元表
示依序對應到的固定位置，並以 0 表示此字
串不存在，以 1 表示此字串存在。若是計算
的數值資料，則使用 k 個位元來表示其二進
位值，其中 k 是取適當足以表示資料且表示
其加總的二進位值；而 Si,j索可依需求加以定
義，再藉由參數的傳遞執行相關程序。 
(3) 資料庫系統之 DNA 計算模式設計: 此
DNA 計算模式設計為三層：資料定義層、程
序模組層與查詢層。資料定義層主要功能在
把資料庫中的屬性、紀錄、資料表對應成
DNA 索。而程序模組層內包含關聯式代數運
算、流程控制、查詢應用模組與所有相關模
組程式，其包含基礎關聯式代數運算模組
等，每個模組都包含 DNA 演算法程序。

Abstract 
This paper presents a novel development of a database model with operational procedures 
by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) computing solution to exploit vast parallelism. The 
proposed solution is based mainly on the recombinant DNA (RDNA) model of Reif [1] to 
implement table design, simulate relational algebra and solve query problems. The potential for 
applying the proposed DNA-based computation to database operations and query-solving 
simulation is theoretically favorable, given the operational time complexity of O(6xy-10y+8k+21) 
bio-steps of the RDNA model, where x, y and k are the total number of levels, the number of 
relational tables and the number of binary value bits, respectively. Being inherent molecular 
parallelism, our proposed model could be potentially an algorithmic basis for database 
operational procedures embedded in biomolecular computations for the further development.

Abstract—This study presents a customized service 
approach by using data mining technology to provide the 
decision makers making profit-marketing policy for a local 
chained mid-sized supermarket in Taiwan. The proposed 
approach mines customer transaction data to extract the top 
20% profit-making customers and then categorize the rest 
customers into n consumption clusters. Programs then 
generate bi-weekly customized electronic coupons (e-
coupon) based on their consumption preferences for each 
cluster customers. Clustering technology and association 
rule are adopted herein associated with relational database. 
Moreover, algorithms have been developed to perform 
extracting valuable customer and implementing the results 
of rules to generate e-coupons. Hence, the implementation 
of our approach will assist the local supermarket decision 
makers determine promotion strategy to gain profit by 
analyzing transaction data regularly. This work provided 
solutions via four steps: (1) database design and data 
transfer, (2) customers clustering, (3) rules mining and (4) 
customized e-coupon generating. A comparison was 
conducted to test the effectiveness and showed that there 
was an improvement between adopting the proposed 
approach, as compared with without adopting. 
Keywords - data mining, marketing promotion plan, 
customerized e-coupon, association rules, cluster technology 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Incorporating information technology and marketing 
strategy plan to solidify the relationship between customers 
and enterprises has become a top priority task for decision 
makers in recent years. Due to the growth of information 
technology, enterprises are capable of collecting instant huge 
data easily. Thus, how to make data a competitive 
intelligence by converting meaningless data into useful 
information and further becoming useful knowledge to 
support decision making is a critical challenge for business. 
Data mining technology has been widely adopted to predict 
customer behaviors for the past few years. It contains all 
activities and technologies to utilize the collected data to 
discover implicit information and analyze the historical 
records to gain valuable knowledge. Fayyad et al. [1] define 
data mining as the nontrivial process of identifying valid, 
novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable 
patterns in data. John [2] defines it as the process of 
discovering advantageous patterns in data. Data mining 
technology searches for pattern presented in a particular 
representation set, including classification rules, decision 
trees, clustering, regression and sequence modeling. In the 
application of business application, new pattern discovery 
can be implemented to make prediction of customer’s 
individual purchasing preference. The presentation of 
promotional product information to customers via web has 
become increasingly important for many companies. Thus, 
researches on the mining data to generate customer-oriented 
topics have been proposed [3-4]. Marketing strategy aims to 
gain the most profits for a business. One of the key strategies 
includes maintaining a long-term relationship with customers 
and building their loyalty to an enterprise. It could be 
achieved by providing customer services and further 
discovering customers’ purchasing patterns and predicting 
their change. All these information is obtained by the result 
of marketing survey and analyzed by statistic 
software/experts in the past. Since now, data mining 
technology has been used; such as Giudici etc [5] use 
statistic association and graphic models to study customer 
behaviors and discuss model selection procedures. 
However, data mining technology is mostly applied in 
enterprises in Taiwan. Still many local organizations run 
their businesses by traditional promotion strategy. This study 
aims to improve the promotion strategy design for a mid-
sized local chained supermarket by consulting the manager 
of supermarket and adopting the mining technology. We 
analyze customer consumption patterns, develop programs 
and use data mining techniques to help manager discover 
consumption preferences pattern and then generate e-coupon 
to improve marketing sales. Cluster and association rule 
algorithms in Microsoft SQL Server 2005 are used in this 
environment to implement analysis service. The functions 
and attributes of tables are explained as follows. 
 
 
Fig. 2. Database design 
 
Fig. 1 System frame 
Customer: It maintains customer’s basic data and 
includes Id, name, sex, address, e-mail, birthday, education 
degree, career, monthly income (NT dollars), VIP member 
and household number for each member customer. 
Product: It maintains product’s data and includes Id, 
name, brand, the belonging category (such as food, 
drink,…etc.) and update_period of the product. The field 
update_period is used to determine the loyalty of the 
customer to the specific product. 
Trans_detail: It records the transaction details and 
includes transaction ID, customer Id, product ID, transaction 
date and time and each purchasing quantity for one specific 
product. We then apply cluster algorithm to classify these two group customers in SQL Server 2005 separately and output 
sub-clusters. Cluster detection is derived from a map of self-
organizing neural networks. In the processing of cluster, data 
are partitioned into subsets based on the degree of similarity. 
Cluster algorithm automatically detects difference between 
the groups in the database. The cluster algorithm can be used 
to cluster data to groups before running further analysis 
while processing mass data and variables. The K-means 
algorithm is one of the best implementation of cluster 
technology. It basically includes three steps. Step 1: It 
randomly selects K numbers of observations as centers of 
initial clusters from N observations. Step 2: It finds the 
nearest cluster in terms of the Euclidean distance with 
respect to xi = (xi1, xi2,…, xip) for each of the remaining (N-K) 
observations.  Step 3: It calculates the Euclidean distance 
between each observation and calculate the cluster’s center 
point to verify that whether they have been allocated to the 
nearest cluster when all observations have been allocated. 
Product_price: It shows the selling price of a product. 
Since the selling price for every product varies depends on 
the wholesale price at the transaction time period, this table 
contains product Id and transaction date, selling price and 
whole sale price. The profit of one product comes from the 
difference between selling price and wholesale price. 
Category: It contains category Id and Category name. 
3.2 Customers Clustering 
In this phase, a series of algorithms are designed to 
extract VIP cluster customers. These algorithms consider 
attributes in database tables as key attributes, such as 
household number, income, purchasing product category, 
career and education of each member. An attribute named 
“profit” is calculated from Product_price table (discussed in 
Section 3.1) to calculate monthly profit. The following 
algorithm is the main program to output VIP and Non-VIP 
members to class1 and class2. 
3.3 Rules mining  
Association rule in SQL Server 2005 is applied to 
generate purchasing rules for each sub-cluster in this phase. 
customer_id, discount percentage and item_id. Currently, 
the content criteria of e-coupon are determined by user 
(manager) based on the conclusion of rules. Basically, we 
apply association rule algorithm to find out the valuable 
customers’ purchasing pattern and predict their next 
purchasing and then promote associated products which 
might attract their attention and encourage their purchasing 
intention. Customers receive the coupon either via e-mail or 
receive the printout while customers make purchasing. 
The result of experiment shows the performance of the 
system. In comparison with the average month profit data 
over year 2008 and 2009, the proposed approach achieves 
10% better performance in the month profit on 2010 (Fig. 6).

5. CONCLUSIONS 
Analysis of customer purchasing patterns and further 
generation of suggested promotion strategy would potentially 
assist the mid-sized stores to survive better in the 
competition of worldwide organization. The main 
contribution of the experiment result shows the proposed 
approach achieves 10% improvement in the month profit 
compared with the past two years. In this study, data mining 
tool is used to cluster customers into groups based on data 
over year between 2008 and 2009. The VIP algorithms are 
programmed to segment the 20% and 80% customers. To 
analyze customer consumption preference, we used the 
cluster and association rule of SQL Server 2005 analysis 
service to cluster groups and mine the rules. The system then 
generates e-coupon. The approach is currently implemented 
as a prototype. Further research will focus on two directions. 
(1). Either combine the programs output to SQL Server 2005 
analysis service, or design customized mining system for the 
business; (2). Provide more customized promotion plan for 
the business by adopting the output of rules and by designing 
data mining algorithms.
