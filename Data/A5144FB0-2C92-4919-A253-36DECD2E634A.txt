Yuen-Kai Co., Ltd. specializes mainly in plastic injection and molding as well as 
manufacturing all kinds of desk calendars. A desk calendar consists of three major parts: booklet, 
plastic platform and plastic spring. The booklet and plastic platform with many small holes are 
made into a desk calendar with the plastic platform at the bottom by threading in the plastic spring, 
which allows the pages to be turned over smoothly. The move of threading a plastic spring 
through the holes of the booklet and the plastic platform to make a volume is a bottleneck in 
assembling operation, which currently is conducted manually. According to the makers, most of 
the assembly is done by inmates at prison at low cost or by people in the countryside for low pay. 
Recently, due to Taiwan’s upsurge in wages, except for prints that are commissioned to other 
companies, the rest of the assembly is shipped to countries of low wages for assembly. In addition 
to transport expenses, the damage incurred in transport process should also be borne, which 
directly diminishes quality and increases costs. 
To resolve the makers’ bottleneck as described above, this research has designed an 
automatic assembling machine for desk calendars that can automatically undertake feeding, 
assembling and material return. This research first explores the advantages and disadvantages of 
existing processing methods and processes which can be automated, and lists each design and its 
advantages and disadvantages; and then it selects those excellent ones among them to undertake 
designing and proceeds with the test-making of the prototype. The goal of this research is to 
design and make the prototype of an automatic desk calendar assembling machine, which, after 
sufficient discussion, hopefully can become a special-purpose machine for manufacturers.
