In this proposal, we report on the synthesis of a new series of three para-substituted styrene 
monomers with pi-conjugated mono-, di-, and tri(9,9-dihexylfluorene) moieties, abbreviated as 
St-Fl, St-Fl2, St-Fl3, and their anionic polymerization behaviors, especially from a view point of 
living polymerization. Besides, we describe the synthesis of a series of 
poly[4-(9,9-dihexylfluoren-2-yl)styrene]-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P(St-F1)-b-P2VP) and 
poly[4-di(9,9-dihexylfluoren-2-yl)styrene]-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P(St-F12)-b-P2VP). The 
block composition, molecular weight, and the length of the fluorene side chain were varied in 
order to control the final morphologies. Moreover, we use the multifunctional benzyl halide 
derivatives considered in the synthesis of star shape polymers by the coupling reaction with living 
anionic polymers. Herein we also report the successful synthesis of well-defined star shape 
polymer by coupling the anionic chain end P(StFl) with different benzyl bromide moieties.  
 
2. Objectives 
 
We plan to explore (1) the anionic polymerization behavior of the novel styrene monomers 
p-substituted with oligo(fluorene)s, and (2) amphiphilic block copolymer and their morphologies, 
(3) symmetric star-shape polymer containing conjugated moiety by using anionic polymerization. 
 
3. Experimental 
 
Materials. All of the reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Acros and used as received, 
unless otherwise stated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was refluxed over sodium wire, distilled over 
LiAlH4 under nitrogen, and then distilled from its sodium naphthalenide solution under high 
vacuum conditions (10-6 torr).  Heptane and tert-butylbenzene were washed with conc. H2SO4, 
water, aq. NaHCO3, and dried over P2O5, and finally distilled in the presence of 
1,1-diphenylhexyllithium. Styrene was washed with aq. NaOH (10 wt-%) and water, and dried 
over MgSO4. After filtration, styrene was distilled twice over CaH2 under reduced pressures and 
finally distilled over Bu2Mg under high vacuum conditions. sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi, 1.2 M in 
heptane, Aldrich Japan) was diluted with heptane and determined in concentration by the 
colorimetric titration from colorless end-point of the red-colored solution obtained after the 
addition of 1,1-diphenylethylene with standardized octanol in THF solution under high vacuum 
conditions.  
 
Synthesis of Styrene Monomers p-Substituted with Oligo(fluorene)s, St-Fl, St-Fl2, and 
St-Fl3. 
 The synthesis of styrene monomers p-substituted with fluorene, bifluorene, and trifluorene 
moieties, St-Fl, St-Fl2, and St-Fl3, was accomplished through the Suzuki coupling reaction of 
p-vinylphenylboronic acid with the corresponding 9,9-dihexyl-2-dibromofluorene derivatives. 
The reaction scheme was shown in Scheme 1. Besides, the intermediate chemical structure, 
 4 
degassed methanol. The first stage polymerization was carried out at -78 °C by mixing St-Fl in 
THF solution with sec-BuLi in heptane solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 3 
h. Then, functional BnBr core in THF solution was added to the reaction reactor under -40oC for 
additional 48 hrs. Finally, the reaction mixture was quenched with degassed methanol and the 
polymer was concentrated using rotary to dry. The polymer was purified by wash with THF and 
methanol mixed solvent. The specific amount of initiator and monomers added in the reaction, 
molecular weight, and composition measured by RALLS-SEC as listed in Table 3. 
 
Measurements. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on an Asahi Techneion 
AT-2002 equipped with a Viscotek TDA model 302 triple detector array using THF as a carrier 
solvent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 30 °C. Three polystyrene gel columns of bead size 5 µm 
and pore size of 200, 75, and 25 Å and bead size 9 µm and pore size 650, 200, and 75 Å were 
used. Both 1H and 13CNMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DPX300 in CDCl3. Chemical 
shifts were recorded in ppm downfield relative to (CH3)4Si (δ 0) and CDCl3 (δ 77.1) for 1H and 
13C NMR as standards, respectively.  
 
4. Results and discussions 
 
4.1 Anionic Polymerization of St-Fl, St-Fl2, and St-Fl3 
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the fluorene dimmer, followed by trimmer, had the same terminal 
bromide as the starting 9,9-dihexyl-2-bromofluorene, the same Suzuki coupling reaction could be 
repeated to increase stepwise the number of fluorene unit. The resulting styrene monomers were 
purified by column chromatography and trace amounts of water were removed by azeotropic 
distillation with absolute benzene several times under reduced pressures and finally dried for 24 – 
48 h under high vacuum conditions (10-6 torr) in the presence of P2O5 placed in another vessel. 
They are either viscous liquid or semi-solid soluble in common organic solvents. Interestingly, 
however, only St-Fl was insoluble in benzene. Therefore, these monomers were dissolved in THF 
or tert-butylbenzene instead of benzene and employed in the anionic polymerization. The 
1H-NMR、13C-NMR of the monomers, St-Fl, StFl2 were shown in Figure1-4. 
 
The anionic polymerization of St-Fl was first performed in THF at -78 °C for 3 - 24 h using 
sec-BuLi as initiator under high vacuum with break-seals. On addition of St-Fl to sec-BuLi, a 
characteristic dark blue color immediately developed as shown in Figure 5, strongly indicating 
the generation of St-Fl-derived propagating chain-end anion. This color remained unchanged 
during the course of polymerization, but disappeared by adding degassed methanol to quench the 
polymerization. The yield of polymer was always quantitative. The 1H NMR spectrum of the 
resulting polymer as shown in Figure 1 revealed the absence of signals for the vinyl protons and 
the presence of new resonances attributable to the backbone chain protons. The relative 1H NMR 
signal intensities of aliphatic protons for both the backbone chain and the hexyl groups to 
 6 
 
As mentioned above, the styrene monomer p-substituted with 9,9-dihexylfluorene moiety, 
St-Fl, underwent living anionic polymerization without any problem. In this section, the anionic 
polymerizations of the styrene monomers p-substituted with 9,9-dihexylfluorene dimmer and 
trimmer, St-Fl2 and St-Fl3, were examined under the same conditions. The anionic 
polymerization of St-Fl2 was first carried out in THF with sec-BuLi at -78 °C. The 
polymerization system always colored dark blue, similar to that of St-Fl, and remained 
unchanged during the course of the polymerization. Yields of polymers were quantitative. The 1H 
and 13C NMR spectra of the resulting polymer revealed that the vinyl polymerization exclusively 
occurred (Figures 2 and 4). The polymerization results are also given in Table 1 
(St-Fl2-1~St-Fl2-3). The molecular weights were well controlled in the range from 6 000 to 50 
000 g/mol. Moreover, a poly(St-FL2) with a predictable molecular weight and a narrow 
molecular weight distribution was quantitatively obtained in tert-butylbenzene with sec-BuLi at 
20 °C for 24 h. As shown in Figure 6(b), the polymers all possess narrow monomodal SEC 
distributions, the Mw/Mn values being less than 1.05.   
 
The anionic polymerization of St-Fl3 was performed in THF with sec-BuLi at -78 °C. Similar 
to the cases with St-Fl and St-Fl2, a characteristic dark blue color was developed on mixing 
St-Fl3 with the initiator. A yield of polymer was quantitative. The SEC profile of the resulting 
polymer exhibited a narrow monomodal distribution. Although the Mn value measured by 
SEC-RALLS was somewhat higher than that calculated from monomer to initiator ratio, it 
became close to the calculated value using the concentration of active chain-end determined by 
the colorimetric titration in vacuo (St-Fl3-1). This may possibly be caused by the loss of initiator 
activity due to impurities in St-Fl3 as mentioned above (see St-Fl-4). Unfortunately, no 
polymerization occurred probably due to the impurities when higher molecular weight 
poly(St-Fl3) (Mn > 30 000 g/mol) was prepared (see St-Fl3-2). At the moment, more vigorous 
purification of St-Fl3 is essential to examine the anionic polymerization behavior in detail, 
although the preliminary result strongly indicated occurring of the living anionic polymerization 
of St-Fl3.  The anionic polymerization of St-Fl3 is now in progress. 
 
Similar to the case of poly(St-Fl), the absolute molecular weights of poly(St-Fl2) as well as 
poly(St-Fl3) by SEC-RALLS were observed to be always higher than those calculated by SEC 
using standard polystyrene calibration curve. Again, the presence of the fluorene dimmer and 
trimmer as side chains may affect on the hydrodynamic volumes in THF. 
 
 
4.2 Synthesis of Amphiphilic Block Copolymers.  
The block polymers of P(St-Fl)-block-P2VP and P(St-Fl2)-block-P2VP were synthesized by 
sequential living anionic polymerization as depicted in Scheme 3, similar to our recent study on
