Abstract 
Process intensification is one of the most important trends in green chemical process technology.  
Thermally coupled distillation and reactive distillation are two promising applications of process 
intensification.  In this project, a new process technology with high potential, thermally coupled reactive 
distillation, is addressed and its process design and control strategies were studied.  This project is 
implemented in two years.  In the first year, we design thermally coupled reactive distillation processes and 
investigate the effect of thermal coupling on energy saving.  The first is two ideal reaction systems with the 
highest energy consumption among the different relative volatility rankings of reactants and products and the 
second is two real transesterification reaction systems.  Different thermal coupling structures are constructed 
by implementing partially or fully thermal coupling between columns and 22.2% and 20.3% energy saving 
can be obtained for these two ideal reactive systems, respectively.  In the transesterification reaction of 
n-butanol and methyl acetate to produce n-butyl acetate and methanol, 20% energy saving can be obtained.  
In the transesterification of ethylene carbonate and methanol to produce dimethyl carbonate and ethylene 
glycol, reactive distillation + thermally coupled extractive distillation provides the best energy efficiency. 
In the second year, proper selection and pairing of controlled and manipulated variables are determined by 
using steady-state analysis for the ideal reaction system with the most degree of the thermal coupling and the 
real reaction system to produce dimethyl carbonate and ethylene glycol.  Temperature control or composition 
+ temperature cascade control schemes are used in these two reaction systems.  Dynamic tests show that the 
proposed control scheme can maintain high product purity and stoichiometric balance between the reactant 
feeds.

Figure 1a shows the nominal process flowsheet of type IR with excess design.  Reactants A (LLK) and B 
(HHK) with a flow rate of 12.6 kmol/hr, respectively, are fed into a 35-stage RDC (C1) at stage 1.  The RDC 
has 21 trays (including a total condenser) in the reaction zone, followed by a stripping section with 14 trays 
(including a partial reboiler).  The column is operated at 8 bar under total reflux.  The bottom product of 
column C1 is then fed to a 36-stage conventional distillation column (C2) at stage 19.  Product C (LK) with 
purity 95 mol% is produced in the column distillate.  The bottom product, mainly consisting of B and D 
(HK), of the column is fed to a 26-stage conventional distillation column (C3) at stage 14.  Product D with 
purity 95 mol% is obtained from the column overhead and reactant B (with purity 95 mol%) recovered from 
the column base is recycled back to the column C1.  In the process, there are five design degrees of freedom: 
boilup ratios of three columns and reflux ratios of columns C2 and C3.  The reflux ratio of column C2 and 
reflux ratio and boilup ratio of column C3 are adjusted to satisfy purity specifications of C, D, and B, 
respectively, from three outlet streams.  The remaining two design degrees of freedom, boilup ratios of 
columns C1 and C2, are used to minimize the total reboiler duty of the process.  Figure 1a also shows the 
stream information and operating conditions of the process with the minimum total reboiler duty (822.8 kcal/s) 
when the boilup ratios of columns C1 and C2 are 0.980 and 1.680, respectively.  The reboiler heat inputs for 
columns C1, C2, and C3 are 268.3 kcal/s, 299.0 kcal/s, and 255.5 kcal/s, respectively.

Figure 1. Nominal processes for (a) type IR and (b) type IIR with excess design. 
Figure 1b shows the nominal process flowsheet of type IIR with excess design.  Reactants A (LLK) and 
B (LK) with flow rates of 12.34 kmol/hr and 12.86 kmol/hr, respectively, are fed into a 27-stage RDC (C1) at 
stage 1.  The RDC has 19 trays (including a total condenser) in the reaction zone, followed by a stripping 
section with 8 trays (including a partial reboiler).  The column is operated at 10 bar under total reflux.  The 
bottom product of column C1 is then fed to a 25-stage conventional distillation column (C2) at stage 13.  
Reactant B with purity 90 mol% is recovered from the column top and recycled back to the column C1.  The 
bottom product, mainly consisting of C (HK) and D (HHK), of the column is fed to a 35-stage conventional 
distillation column (C3) at stage 19.  The product purities of C at distillate and D at bottoms are set at 95 
mol% and 99 mol%, respectively.  In the process, there are the same five design degrees of freedom as those 
 4
coupling between column C1 and the system with fully thermal coupling (constructed in structure 3).  The 
design of these four thermally coupled processes and the effect of thermal coupling on energy consumption 
are discussed in the following. 
Figure 2a shows the reactive distillation configuration (denoted by PTC) where partially thermal 
coupling is implemented between two conventional distillation columns.  Liquid and vapor are interchanged 
between columns C2 and C3.  In order to reduce energy consumption further, partially thermal coupling is 
explored between the RDC and the system with partially thermal coupling shown in Figure 2a.  Figure 2b 
shows the process configuration (denoted by PTC_PTC) with partially thermal coupling twice.  Liquid and 
vapor are interchanged not only between columns C2 and C3 but also between columns C1 and C2.  Table 2 
gives the total reboiler duty of PTC and PTC_PTC configurations for type IR.  The process shown in Figure 
2a can save 8.0% total energy consumption than the one without thermal coupling.  The process with 
PTC_PTC structure in Figure 2b can save 18.6% total energy consumption than the one without thermal 
coupling and 10.6% total energy consumption can be further reduced by implementing partially thermal 
coupling between the RDC and the system with partially thermal coupling. 
Figure 2c shows the reactive distillation configuration (denoted by FTC) where a divided wall column 
(DWC) is constructed by implementing fully thermal coupling between two conventional distillation columns.  
The process shown in Figure 2c can save 8.3% total energy consumption (given in Table 2) than the one 
without thermal coupling.  It can be found from the figure that the optimal position of the divided wall is 
located at the column middle when the feed compositions of the DWC for components C, D, and B are near 
equal.  There is not apparent difference between energy consumption for the systems with partially thermal 
coupling (PTC) and fully thermal coupling (FTC).  To further investigate the effect of thermal coupling on 
energy consumption, partially thermal coupling is also implemented between the RDC and the DWC of the 
process shown in Figure 2c.  Figure 2d shows the process configuration (denoted by PTC_FTC) with both 
partially thermal coupling and fully thermal coupling.  The process with PTC_FTC structure can save 17.9% 
total energy consumption than the one without thermal coupling and 9.6% energy consumption can be further 
reduced by implementing partially thermal coupling between the RDC and the DWC.  In the design of DWC 
for the processes of Figures 2c and 2d, the stage number of DWC is set to be equal to the sum of stage 
numbers of two conventional distillation columns.  The stage number in each side of DWC is set to be equal 
to that of the conventional distillation column with less stage number.  Figure 2e shows the process 
configuration (denoted by PTC_FTC*) with the minimum reboiler duty when the length of divided wall is 
used as a design degree of freedom.  The stage number in each side of the divided wall is reduced from 26 to 
22 and 22.2% energy saving can be obtained than the process without thermal coupling.  Energy 
consumption can be further reduced 4.3% by only decreasing the length of divided wall in the process shown 
in Figure 2d.

thermally coupled processes for type IR

In implementing fully thermal coupling between two conventional distillation columns, the stage number 
of DWC is set to be equal to the sum of stage numbers of two conventional distillation columns and the stage 
number in each side of DWC is first set to be equal to that of the conventional distillation column with less 
stage number.  It is found that the minimum total reboiler duty (715.2 kcal/s) for the process (denoted by 
FTC) with fully thermal coupling between conventional distillation columns is larger than that for the process 
without thermal coupling.  However, energy consumption can be substantially reduced if the length of 
divided wall is used as a design degree of freedom.  Figure 3c shows the optimal process configuration 
(denoted by FTC*) with the minimum total reboiler duties when stage number in each side of divided wall is 
reduced from 25 to 21.  The process can save 6.7% energy consumption than the one without thermal 
coupling.  That is, 13.2% energy reduction can be obtained by adjusting the length of divided wall.  The 
divided wall is located at the position somewhat near the DWC top for the feed with larger amounts of C and 
D.  Partially thermal coupling is also implemented between RDC and DWC of the process shown in Figure 
3c to further reduce the energy consumption.  Figure 3d shows the process configuration (denoted by 
PTC_FTC*) with both partially thermal coupling and fully thermal coupling and11.7% energy reduction can 
be obtained by adding partially thermal coupling between the RDC and the DWC. 
From above simulation results, thermally coupled reactive distillation can provide better energy 
efficiency than reactive distillation without thermal coupling and 22.2% and 20.3% energy saving can be 
obtained for these two ideal reactive systems, respectively. 
3. Process Design of Transesterification Reactive Distillation with Thermal Coupling for the Synthesis 
of n-Butyl Acetate and Methanol 
The transesterification reaction of methyl acetate and n-butanol is proceeded as follows: 
n-butanol+methyl acetate⇌n-butyl acetate+methanol                   (1) 
n-Butyl acetate and methanol are the high and low boiling products, respectively.  n-Butanol and methyl 
acetate are the high and low boiling reactants, respectively.  The yield for the transesterification reaction is 
strongly limited by the equilibrium conversion.  Kinetic data given by Jiménez et al.14 for a sulfonic 
ion-exchange resin, Amberlyst 15, were used in the study. 
 Figure 4a is a schematic illustration of the conventionally complete reactive distillation process, 
including a reactive distillation column and a separation column.  n-Butanol and methyl acetate reactants 
with 100 kmol/h each are fed to the stages 28 and 43, respectively, numbering from the column top.  The 
column is operated at 1 atm.  The pressure drop in the column is assumed to be 0.2 atm.  The column is 
sized as a tray-column with diameter 2.7 m.  A liquid holdup of about 200 L was obtained.  We assume that 
a reaction volume of 50 L and catalyst of 500 g are available on every tray in the reactive zone.  n-Butyl 
acetate with high-purity 99.5 mol% is withdrawn from the column bottom.  The distillate product is a 
mixture of methanol and un-reacted methyl acetate and then fed to a separation column with 10 stages.  High 
methanol purity, 99.5 mol%, is obtained from the column bottom.  The distillate of the column, approximate 
the minimum boiling azeotrope of methanol and methyl acetate, is recycled back to the fresh methyl acetate

4. Design of DMC Synthesis Process via Reactive Distillation and Thermally Coupled Extractive 
Distillation 
The transesterification reaction of EC and MeOH is proceeded as follows: 
EC + 2MeOH ⇌ DMC + EG                           (2) 
EC and MeOH are the high and low boiling reactants, respectively.  EG and DMC are the high and low 
boiling products, respectively.  The yield for the transesterification reaction is strongly limited by the 
equilibrium conversion.  This reversible reaction can be catalyzed by basic catalyst.  The kinetic equation 
for the reaction catalyzed by a homogeneous catalyst, sodium methoxide, can be expressed as15:

The simulation of the transesterification distillation was carried out using the rigorous distillation model 
provided by ChemCad software.  Nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model was used for the 
vapor-liquid equilibrium of this reactive system with four components.  Table 4 gives the NRTL parameters 
of the system.  The set of NRTL parameters for (EC, MeOH), (EC, DMC), (EC, EG) and (DMC, EG) pairs 
is obtained from Fang and Qian.16  Fang and Liu17 provided thermodynamic parameters of MeOH and DMC 
from vapor-liquid equilibrium data at 1 atm.  However, their thermodynamic model gave large deviation 
from experimental data under high pressure condition needed in subsequent pressure-swing distillation.  The 
NRTL parameters of MeOH and DMC given in Table 4 is calculated by regressing vapor-liquid equilibrium 
data at 1 atm18 and azeotropic data of MeOH/DMC at different pressures.19  The NRTL parameters for 
 8
with a purity of 99.8 mol%.  The MeOH/DMC mixture, rich in MeOH, is distilled from the top and fed to the 
low-pressure column.  High-purity methanol, 99.99 mol%, is withdrawn from the column base and recycled 
back to the fresh methanol feed location in the RDC.  The top product containing MeOH and DMC is 
recycled back to the high-pressure column. 
The pressure-swing distillation system is first designed by running the rigorous simulation with two 
bottoms compositions held at their specified values.  Sufficiently large numbers of stages for high- and 
low-pressure columns are used and two reflux ratios are determined by minimizing the total reboiler duties of 
the system.  The numbers of stages for the two columns are increased until two reflux ratios stop decreasing.  
The approximated minimum reflux ratios can be obtained from iterative simulations and are found to be 2.55 
and 4.0 in the high- and low-pressure columns, respectively.  The corresponding methanol compositions at 
the distillates of these two columns are 93.70 mol% and 86.55 mol%, respectively.  The pressure-swing 
distillation system is next designed with distillate and bottoms compositions held at their specified values.  
DMC and methanol specifications are 99.8 mol% and 99.99 mol% at the column bases of high- and 
low-pressure columns, respectively.  Methanol composition specifications from the distillates of high- and 
low-pressure columns are 92.76 mol% (1 mol% lower than 93.70 mol%) and 87.41 mol% (1 mol% higher 
than 86.55 mol%), respectively.  For the column design, the reflux ratios are set to 1.2 times of the 
approximated minimum reflux ratio.  Given the product specifications, the numbers of stage are found to be 
23 for the high-pressure column and 35 for the low-pressure one.  The optimum feed stage locations are 
determined by finding the feed stages that minimize reboiler duty.  Figure 6 also shows the stream 
information and operating conditions for the plant-wide process of reactive distillation + pressure-swing 
distillation.  The reboiler duties for RDC, high- and low-pressure columns are 12.86 GJ/hr, 40.76 GJ/hr, and 
36.33 GJ/hr, respectively.

until reflux ratios stop decreasing.  Then the actual reflux ratios are set to 1.2 times the approximated minima.  
Given the reflux ratios, the numbers of stages required to achieve specifications are found to be 48 in the EDC 
and 32 in the solvent recovery column.  The optimum feed stage locations for the approximate MeOH/DMC 
azeotrope and phenol are determined by minimizing the reboiler duty.  The feed stages are 6 for the phenol 
with a flow rate of 355.1 kmol/hr and 40 for the distillate from the RDC.  For the temperature of the solvent 
feed, Knight and Doherty21 suggested to set the feed temperature to be a few degrees (about 5-15°C) below 
the top temperature of the EDC.  We used a temperature of 50 °C in the simulation, which is achieved by 
using a cooler (top temperature of the column is 64.5 °C).  Figure 9 also shows the stream information and 
operating conditions for the plant-wide process of reactive distillation + extractive distillation.  The reboiler 
heat inputs for RDC, EDC, and solvent recovery column are 12.94 GJ/hr, 17.20 GJ/hr, and 4.97 GJ/hr, 
respectively.  There is only little difference between the reboiler duties of RDCs in two different plant-wide 
processes shown in Figures 6 and 9.  However, extractive distillation system provides much less energy 
consumption than that in the pressure-swing distillation system.  The reboiler heat inputs in the extractive 
distillation system are only about 28.8% of those in the pressure-swing distillation system.

4.3 Design of reactive distillation + thermally coupled extractive distillation 
In order to reduce energy consumption further, the thermal coupling of the reactive distillation + 
extractive distillation process is explored. Because we focus on the coupling between the EDC and the solvent 
recovery column, the RDC in this thermally coupled flowsheet (Figure 11a) is identical to that of the one 
without thermal coupling (Figure 9).  Without loss of generality, the same numbers of stages (cf. Figure 9 
and Figure 11) are used for systems without and with thermal coupling.  Liquid and vapor are interchanged 
between the EDC and the solvent recovery column as shown in Figure 11a.  The configuration in Figure 11b

little difference between the reboiler duties (12.94 GJ/hr vs 13.43 GJ/hr) of RDCs in these two processes, and 
the difference comes from the increased recycle flow rate of methanol for the thermal coupling one.  
However, extractive distillation with thermal coupling provides less energy consumption than that without 
thermal coupling.  It can save about 17.6% of the reboiler duty in the extractive distillation without thermal 
coupling.  Figure 11 also shows the stream information and operating conditions for the plant-wide process 
of reactive distillation + thermally coupled extractive distillation. 
In the designed pressure-swing distillation system shown in Figure 6, the condenser and reboiler duties 
are 37.58 GJ/hr and 40.76 GJ/hr, respectively, for the high-pressure column while the condenser and reboiler 
duties are 38.99 GJ/hr and 36.33 GJ/hr, respectively, for the low-pressure column.  The condenser 
temperature (137.2℃) in the high-pressure column is higher than the base temperature (64.5℃) in the 
low-pressure column.  Then the heat removed from the condenser of the high-pressure column can be used 
as the heat input to the base of the low-pressure column.  However, the reboiler duty of the high-pressure 
column is still much larger than the reboiler duties of the extractive distillation systems without and with 
thermal coupling (22.17 GJ/hr and 18.27 GJ/hr, respectively).  In the methods used in the study to separate 
MeOH and DMC, extractive distillation with thermal coupling provides the best energy efficiency. 
5. Control of Ideal Reactive Distillation with Thermal Coupling 
For a RDC in the kinetic regime, the desired steady-state temperature or composition profile changes 
when feed rate changes and product purities are kept at their designed values.22  For a thermally coupled 
distillation column, the desired steady-state temperature or composition profile also changes for various split 
ratios under product purities kept at their designed values.23  In industrial applications, temperature control is 
usually used instead of composition control.  The reason is that most product analyzers, such as gas 
chromatographs, suffer from large measurement delays and high investment and maintenance cost.  To 
improve the control performance and have a faster mean of measuring the changes occurring in column 
during transient conditions, the feasibility of temperature control is investigated by adding two kinds of 
disturbances, external disturbances such as changes in reactant feed rates and internal disturbances such as 
changes in vapor split in the reactive distillation processes with PTC_FTC* structure for type IR.  The vapor 
split is usually determined by the location of the split and the pressure drop of the split sections.  The split of 
vapor flow is therefore not controlled.  Hence there are three keys to controlling such a process: (1) to 
maintain the correct stoichiometric balance between the reactant feeds, (2) to maintain the product quality, (3) 
to account for possible changes in control objective when throughput rate or vapor split changes. 
The product purity and stoichiometric balance between the reactant feeds must be maintained when 
operating a RDC.  Feed ratio control is the simplest way to maintain stoichiometric balance.  However, 
when there is a measurement bias in feed flow rate, the feed-ratio control scheme will not be able to keep the 
desired feed ratio.  To overcome this problem, Al-Arfaj and Luyben24 suggested that the reactant 
composition of some column stage be controlled by the reactant feed flow.  In the study, an internal 
composition loop is replaced by an internal temperature loop.  The feed flows of reactants A and B are two 
candidates for the manipulated variable of the internal temperature control.  Reactant A feed flow is selected 
as the manipulated variable because internal stage temperature is more sensitive to reactant A feed flow than 
reactant B feed flow.  There are three product compositions (C at the distillate, D at the side draw, and B at 
the bottom of the DWC) to be maintained in the RDC + DWC shown in Figure 2e.  They are maintained by 
adjusting the reflux flow, sidedraw, and reboiler duty of the DWC.  Figure 12 gives stage temperature

Figure 13: Desired Profiles of Temperature Changes in the RDC and DWC for Changes of Reactant Feed 
Rates and VSR under Product Purities Kept as Their Designed Values 
Figure 13 gives the desired profiles of temperature changes for the RDC and DWC when reactant feed 
rates and VSR are increased or decreased by the amounts, 20% and 10%, respectively, under product purities 
kept as their designed values.  It shows the necessary temperature variations from nominal condition under 
external and internal disturbances and there is more influence for vapor split changes on the desired 
temperature profiles in the RDC and DWC.  This figure indicates that the set points of temperature control 
loops should be changed for product purities to be settled at designed values.  The necessary change for the 
controlled stage temperature in the RDC is relatively smaller than the necessary changes for the controlled 
stage temeratures in the DWC.  In the study, the set point of temperature loop in the RDC remains 
unchanged and the set points of temperature loops in the DWC are reset by cascade composition loops with C, 
D, and B product purities at distillate, side draw, and bottom, respectively as controlled variables and the set 
points of the inner temperature control loops as the manipulated variables.  RGA analysis, shown in Table 6, 
is also used to pair the manipulated and controlled variables in the temperature + composition cascade control 
scheme.  It indicates that the set points of the temperature loops using T32(DWC), T58(DWC), and T27(DWC) as 
controlled variables should be reset by the composition loops using C, D, and B as controlled variables, 
respectively.  There are little interactions between the inner and outer loops of the cascade control scheme.  
Figure 14 shows the scheme of temperature control in the RDC and temperature + composition cascade 
 16
when there is a measurement bias in feed flow rate, the feed-ratio control scheme will not be able to keep the 
desired feed ratio.  To overcome this problem, Al-Arfaj and Luyben24 suggested that the reactant 
composition of some column stage be controlled by the reactant feed flow.  In the study, an internal 
composition loop is replaced by an internal temperature loop.  EC and MeOH feed flows are two candidates 
for the manipulated variable of the internal temperature control.  To maintain high-purity EG at the bottoms 
of the RDC, the other temperature loop is used, in which one stage temperature is maintained by manipulating 
the reboiler duty of the column.  To select appropriate location used for control purpose, singular value 
decomposition (SVD) method25 was used in the study.  Figure 15 gives temperature deviations from nominal 
values for changes in two reactant feeds and reboiler duty in the RDC.  Temperatures of high sensitivity with 
manipulated variables can be found at the stages near the bottom of reactive section.  Figure 16 gives the 
desired temperature profiles of the RDC when reactant feed rates or VSR are increased or decreased by the 
amount, 10%, under product purities kept as their designed values.  Desired profiles of temperature change 
are also given in the figure to more clearly illustrate the necessary temperature variations from nominal 
condition under external and internal disturbances.  The figure shows that there is only little influence for 
vapor split changes on the desired temperature profiles in the RDC.

two overhead compositions under disturbances.  One is to keep two reflux ratios at their nominal values.26  
The other is to hold both reflux flow rates at constant values and only change with the feed rate to the 
EDC.27,28  However, these two control strategies are not suitable for the thermally coupled extractive 
distillation system.  Table 8 gives the comparison of operating condition changes in the system under 
external and internal disturbances for four product purities (EG, MeOH, DMC, phenol) kept at their 
respectively designed values.  When reactant feed rates are changed simultaneously by the same amounts, 
+10%, the change percents for the feed rate of MeOH/DMC mixture to EDC, reflux flow of EDC, reflux flow 
of SR, and solvent feed rate to EDC are almost proportional to the change percents of reactant feed rates.  
There are only small changes of operating condition for the MeOH composition of MeOH/DMC mixture fed 
to the EDC, reflux ratio of EDC, reflux ratio of SR, and the ratio between the feed rates of solvent and 
MeOH/DMC mixture to EDC.  These mean that two overhead compositions of the system can be maintained 
by either keeping two reflux ratios at their nominal values or holding both reflux flow rates at constant values 
and only changing with the feed rate of MeOH/DMC mixture to EDC.  However, some different results are 
observed when VSR is changed by +10%.  There are small changes for the flow rate and MeOH composition 
of MeOH/DMC mixture fed to EDC, solvent feed rate to EDC, and the ratio between the feed rates of solvent 
and MeOH/DMC mixture to EDC.  However, larger changes are observed for reflow flow rates and reflux 
ratios.  Especially, about forty percent changes are necessary for the reflow flow rate and reflux ratio of EDC.  
These results explain that the control strategies to maintain two overhead compositions in the system under 
the disturbances of reactant feed rate are not proper to be used when VSR changes.  Therefore, three 
temperature loops are used in the study to maintain product purities in the thermally coupled extractive 
distillation system.  Three manipulated variables, including reflux flow (m1(EDC)) and reboiler duty (m2(EDC)) 
of EDC and reflow flow (m1(SR)) of SR are used in the temperature loops.

In the following discussions on control performance, the controllers were tuned using a sequential design 
approach29 after the pairing was determined.  For each controller, relay-feedback test30 is performed to obtain 
ultimate gain and ultimate frequency.  The following equations are used to calculate the tuning parameters of 
PI controllers: 
3/CUC KK =                                   (4)

where  and  represent proportional gain and integral time respectively, and   and  are 
ultimate gain and ultimate period respectively.  Figure 19 shows the control scheme for the plant-wide 
process of reactive distillation + thermally coupled extractive distillation.  Five temperature control loops are 
designed by the above steady-state analysis.  In the RDC, column pressure is controlled by manipulating 
coolant flow rate.  Reflux–drum level and base level are maintained by changing reflux flow rate and bottom 
flow rate, respectively.  Reflux ratio is controlled by manipulating distillate flow rate.  The MeOH feed is 
flow controlled.  In the thermally coupled extractive distillation system, pressures of EDC and SR are 
controlled by manipulating coolant flow rates, respectively.  Reflux–drum levels of EDC and SR are

7. Conclusion 
Reactive distillation and thermally coupled distillation are two promising technologies achieving 
substantial economical benefits from process intensification.  In the study, thermally coupled reactive 
distillation, a technology combining reactive distillation and thermally coupled distillation, is performed to 
further enhance the advantages of both integration ways.  Processes with different degrees of coupling are 
designed to achieve possible energy saving for two ideal quaternary systems of types IR and IIR.  Different 
thermal coupling structures are constructed by implementing partially or fully thermal coupling between 
columns for these two systems.  The technology of thermally coupled reactive distillation is also applied to 
two transesterification reaction system with azeotropes.  Simulation results demonstrate that reactive 
distillation with thermal coupling can provide better energy efficiency than reactive distillation without 
thermal coupling. 
Steady-state analysis is used to select controlled and manipulated variables and determine their pairing.  
A temperature control scheme in the reactive distillation column for type IR system is utilized to maintain 
stoichiometric balance between the reactant feeds.  Product purities can be maintained at their desired values 
by a temperature + composition cascade control scheme in the fully thermally coupled column under external 
and internal disturbances.  In the transesterification reaction system to produce dimethyl carbonate and 
ethylene glycol, dynamic simulation results reveal that designed temperature control strategy can maintain 
reactant inventory in the reactive distillation column and product purities at or around their desired values 
under external and internal disturbances.

ABSTRACT 
 
Reactive distillation has become one of the extensively researched process intensification 
methods due to its ability to increase reaction conversion by removing the product and 
simplify separation by reacting away azeotropes.  The process design of the 
transesterification of methyl acetate and n-butanol by reactive distillation to produce 
methanol and n-butyl acetate is investigated in the study.  The n-butyl acetate/n-butanol 
azeotrope is reacted away in the reactive distillation column.  The products from the column 
include n-butyl acetate and a methanol/methyl acetate mixture.  An innovative process, 
reactive pressure-swing distillation, which incorporates the reaction inside a pressure-swing 
distillation, is designed in the study to produce high-purity products of the transesterification 
reaction.  Heat integration technology is used in the process.  The reactive pressure-swing 
distillation process with heat integration not only saves energy consumption but also has 
better operability than the complete conventionally reactive distillation process. 
Keywords: Reactive distillation; Plant-wide Design; Transesterification; Pressure-swing 
distillation, Heat integration. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The coupling of physical separation and chemical reaction in one unit operation, reactive 
distillation, has received increasing attention in recent years.  Reactive distillation (RD) 
increases reaction conversion by removing the product and simplifies separation by reacting 
away azeotropes.  The number of papers in this field has grown rapidly in recent years for 
process design [Doherty and Buzad, 1992; Okasinski and Doherty, 1998; Wang and Wong, 
2006; Tung and Yu, 2007], steady-state behavior description [Barbosa and Doherty, 1988; 
Al-Arfaj and Luyben, 2000a, b; Chen et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2005], and dynamics and 
control [Sneesby et al., 1999; Al-Arfaj and Luyben, 2000a, b; Hung et al., 2006].  Research 
on RD has been comprehensively reviewed by Doherty and Buzad [2001], Sundmacher and 
Kienle [2003], and Luyben and Yu [2008].  One of the processes that can make effective use 
of is the production of methanol and n-butyl acetate by the transesterification reaction of 
methyl acetate and n-butanol.  Like esterification, transesterification is a typical equilibrium-
limited reaction.  Therefore, RD is used to improve conversion.  However, the presence of a 
minimum-boiling azeotrope between methyl acetate and methanol prevents the use of only a 
single RD column because any unreacted methyl acetate leaving from a reaction zone will go

The simulation of the transesterification distillation was carried out using the rigorous 
distillation model provided by ChemCad software.  The liquid phase activities were 
calculated by using modified UNIFAC [Gmehling et al., 1998], as that used in Wang et al. 
[2008].  The quaternary reaction system presents two minimum boiling binary azeotropes 
(methyl acetate/methanol and n-butyl acetate/n-butanol).  The predicted azeotropic 
temperatures and compositions agree well with experimental results provided by Gmehling et 
al. [2004].  Fig. 1 is a conventionally complete RD process used in Wang et al. [2008], 
including a RD column and a separation column.  There are three zones in the RD column 
with 27 (including a total condenser), 16, and 7 (including a partial reboiler) equilibrium 
stages in the rectification, reaction, and stripping zones respectively.  The column is operated 
at 1 atm.  The pressure drop in the column is assumed to be 0.2 atm.  High-boiling and low-
boiling reactants, n-butanol and methyl acetate with 100 kmol/h each, are fed into the top and 
the bottom of the reactive zone, respectively.  A reaction volume of 50 L and catalyst of 500 
g are available on every tray in the reactive zone.  n-Butyl acetate, the high-boiling product,

process is lower than that in the complete conventionally RD process.  These result in higher-
purity methyl acetate fed to the RD column.  Both reboiler duties in the reactive PSD process 
are lower than those (5.31 Gcal/hr and 3.17 Gcal/hr, respectively) in the complete 
conventionally RD process.  30.9% reduction of total reboiler duty is obtained for the reactive 
PSD process.  It was also found that reactive PSD process can provide better energy 
efficiency than the thermally coupled RD process designed in Wang et al. [2008].  Energy-
saving effect by operating RD column at higher pressure is larger than that by implementing 
thermal coupling between two columns for the transesterification reaction.

Fig. 6 shows the comparison of optimal total reboiler duty for different designs of 
transesterification RD under various feed flows of fresh reactant.  The reboiler duty of the 
complete conventionally RD process increases sharply with the fresh reactant feed for the 
same amount of catalyst in the RD column when the fresh reactant feed exceeds the nominal 
one, 100 kmol/hr.  However, the energy consumption increases proportionally with the fresh 
reactant feed for the reactive PSD processes without and with heat integration.  The reactive 
PSD process with heat integration provides the best energy efficiency.  72% reduction of total 
reboiler duty is obtained when fresh reactant feed is equal to 115 kmol/h.  There is no 
solution to obtain high-purity (99.5 mol%) products at two column bottoms when the reactant 
feed exceeds 115 kmol/h for the complete conventionally RD process.  These results reveal 
that the reactive PSD process without and with heat integration not only saves energy 
consumption but also has better operability than the complete conventionally RD process.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
In the study, a RD process is used to produce n-butyl acetate and methanol by the 
transesterification reaction of methyl acetate and n-butanol.  Since methanol and methyl 
acetate formed an azeotrope, the products of a reactive distillation column include n-butyl 
acetate and the mixture of methanol and methyl acetate, which must be separated by an 
additional column.  Methanol/methyl acetate azeotrope is sensitive to pressure and methanol 
azeotropic composition increases with pressure.  The pressure effect is exploited in the 
transesterification reaction to increase the reaction conversion in the RD column and reduce 
the reboiler duty of the process.  A reactive PSD process is designed and the reactive PSD 
processes without and with heat integration give better energy-saving effect than the 
thermally coupled process designed in Wang et al. [2008].  The process with heat integration 
provides the best energy efficiency.  It not only saves energy consumption but also has better 
operability than the complete conventionally RD process.

ABSTRACT 
 
Reactive distillation and thermally coupled distillation are two promising technologies achieving 
substantial economical benefits from process intensification.  In the study, reactive distillation 
processes with different degrees of thermal coupling are designed to achieve possible energy saving 
for an ideal quaternary reaction system with the least favorable relative volatility ranking under excess 
design.  Simulation results demonstrate that thermally coupled reactive distillation can provide better 
energy efficiency than reactive distillation without thermal coupling.  Energy efficiency increases 
with the degree of the thermal coupling. 
Proper selection and pairing of controlled and manipulated variables chosen for three control 
objectives are determined by using steady-state analysis.  A composition + temperature cascade 
scheme in the divided wall column is proposed to reset the set point of temperature control loops.  
Dynamic tests show that the proposed control scheme can reject external disturbances as well as 
internal disturbances and maintain high product purity and stoichiometric balance between the 
reactant feeds.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The separation of multi-component mixtures by continuous distillation has traditionally 
been accomplished by arranging columns in series.  Several alternative configurations exist, 
most notably the direct and indirect sequences.  Thermal coupling between two columns in a 
sequence has proven to be very successful in providing energy savings around 30% with 
respect to the conventional distillation trains [Glinos and Malone, 1988; Triantafyllou and 
Smith, 1992; Wolff and Skogestad, 1995; Annakou and Mizsey, 1996; Emtir et al., 2001].  It 
has been explained in the works of Triantafyllou and Smith [1992] and Herna´ndez et al. 
[2003] that the options of thermally coupled distillation processes can decrease energy 
consumption because remixing is avoided or reduced, in contrast to conventional distillation 
sequences.  Remixing is associated with higher energy consumption because additional 
energy is required in the next column in order to re-purify the mixture.  However, application 
of thermally coupled processes was limited, mainly because of complexity in design and 
control of these structures [Dunnebier and Pantelides, 1999]. 
The coupling of physical separation and chemical reaction in one unit operation, reactive 
distillation, has received increasing attention in recent years.  Reactive distillation increases

3. DESIGN OF REACTIVE DISTILLATION PROCESSES WITH THERMAL 
COUPLING 
The reactive distillation processes with different degrees of thermal coupling are designed in 
the following. 
3.1 Partially thermal coupling between two conventional distillation columns (PTC) 
Fig. 2a shows the reactive distillation configuration (denoted by PTC) where partially 
thermal coupling is implemented between two conventional distillation columns.  Liquid and 
vapor are interchanged between columns C2 and C3.  There are several design degrees of 
freedom in the process.  The feed locations of columns C2 and C3, boilup ratio of column C1 
and vapor split ratio in column C3 are used as the design degrees of freedom to minimize the 
total reboiler duty of the process while reflux ratio of column C2 and reflux and boilup ratios 
of column C3 are used to satisfy three purity specifications of C, D, and B, respectively.  Fig. 
2a also shows the stream information and operating conditions of the process with the 
minimum total reboiler duty (756.7 kcal/s) when boilup ratio of column C1 and vapor split 
ratio in column C3 are 0.915 and 1.586, respectively.  The feeds of columns C2 and C3 are 
located at tray 19 in column C2 and tray 13 in column C3, respectively.  The reboiler heat 
inputs for columns C1 and C3 are 257.5 kcal/s and 499.2 kcal/s, respectively.  The process 
shown in Fig. 2a can save 8.0% total energy consumption than the one without thermal 
coupling. 
3.2 Partially Thermal Coupling Between Column C1 and the System with Partially Thermal 
Coupling (PTC_PTC) 
In order to reduce energy consumption further, partially thermal coupling is explored 
between the RDC and the system with partially thermal coupling shown in Fig. 2a.  Fig. 2b 
shows the process configuration (denoted by PTC_PTC) with partially thermal coupling 
twice.  Liquid and vapor are interchanged not only between columns C2 and C3 but also 
between columns C1 and C2.  In the design degrees of freedom of the process, feed locations 
and vapor split ratios of columns C2 and C3 are used to minimize the total reboiler duty of the 
3 
 
The 5th International Symposium on   PSE ASIA 2010 
Design, Operation and Control of Chemical Processes  July 25-28, 2010, Singapore 
To further investigate the effect of thermal coupling on energy consumption, partially 
thermal coupling is also implemented between the RDC and the DWC of the process shown 
in Fig. 2c.  Fig. 2d shows the process configuration (denoted by PTC_FTC) with both 
partially thermal coupling and fully thermal coupling.  There is no design degree of freedom 
in the RDC.  In the design degrees of freedom of the DWC, feed location, sidedraw location, 
divided wall location, liquid split ratio, and vapor split ratio in the DWC and the vapor split 
from the DWC to the RDC are used to minimize the total reboiler duties of the process while 
the reflux ratio, sidedraw flow, and boilup ratio of the DWC are adjusted to satisfy the purity 
specifications of C, D, and B at the DWC distillate, sidedraw, and bottoms, respectively.  Fig. 
2d also shows the stream information and operating conditions of the process with the 
minimum total reboiler duty (675.6 kcal/s) when liquid split ratio and vapor split ratio of the 
DWC and liquid split ratio from the DWC to the RDC are 4.8, 0.57, and 1.66, respectively.  
The process with PTC_FTC structure can save 17.9% total energy consumption than the one 
without thermal coupling.  From the processes in Figs. 1c and 1d, 9.6% energy consumption 
can be further reduced by implementing partially thermal coupling between the RDC and the 
DWC.  In addition, similar energy efficiency is provided by these two processes shown in 
Figs. 1b and 1d. 
In the design of DWC for the processes of Figs. 1c and 1d, the stage number of DWC is 
set to be equal to the sum of stage numbers of two conventional distillation columns.  The 
stage number in each side of DWC is set to be equal to that of the conventional distillation 
column with less stage number.  However, what is the effect of the divided wall length on 
energy consumption when the stage number of the DWC remains unchanged?  Fig. 2e shows 
the process configuration (denoted by PTC_FTC*) with the minimum reboiler duty (639.8 
kcal/s) when the length of the divided wall is used as a design degree of freedom.  The stage 
number in each side of the divided wall is reduced from 26 to 22.  Liquid split ratio and vapor 
split ratio of the DWC and liquid split ratio from the DWC to the RDC are 4.8, 0.55, and 1.68, 
respectively for the optimal condition with the minimum reboiler duty.  22.2% energy saving 
can be obtained for the process shown in Fig. 2d than the one without thermal coupling.  
Energy consumption can be further reduced 4.3% by only decreasing the length of the 
divided wall in the process shown in Fig. 2d. 
4. CONTROL OF A REACTIVE DISTILLATION PROCESS WITH THERMAL 
COUPLING 
For a RDC in the kinetic regime, the desired steady-state temperature or composition 
profile changes when feed rate changes and product purities are kept at their designed values 
[Wang et al., 2003].  For a thermally coupled distillation column, the desired steady-state 
temperature or composition profile also changes for various split ratios under product purities 
kept at their designed values [Wang and Wong, 2007].  In industrial applications, temperature 
control is usually used instead of composition control.  The reason is that most product 
analyzers, such as gas chromatographs, suffer from large measurement delays and high 
investment and maintenance cost.  To improve the control performance and have a faster 
mean of measuring the changes occurring in column during transient conditions, the 
feasibility of temperature control is investigated by adding two kinds of disturbances, 
external disturbances such as changes in reactant feed rates and internal disturbances such as 
changes in vapor split in the reactive distillation processes with PTC_FTC* structure for type 
IR.  The vapor split is usually determined by the location of the split and the pressure drop of 
the split sections.  The split of vapor flow is therefore not controlled.  Hence there are three 
keys to controlling such a process: (1) to maintain the correct stoichiometric balance between

candidates for the manipulated variable of the internal temperature control.  Reactant A feed 
flow is selected as the manipulated variable because internal stage temperature is more 
sensitive to reactant A feed flow than reactant B feed flow.  There are three product 
compositions (C at the distillate, D at the side draw, and B at the bottom of the DWC) to be 
maintained in the RDC + DWC shown in Fig. 2e.  They are maintained by adjusting the 
reflux flow, sidedraw, and reboiler duty of the DWC.  Fig. 3 gives stage temperature 
deviations from nominal values for changes in reactant A feed flow in the RDC and reflux 
flow, sidedraw, and reboiler duty in the DWC.  To select appropriate location used for control 
purpose, singular value decomposition (SVD) method [Moore, 1992] was used in the study.  
The controlled temperatures are selected at stage 31 in the RDC and stages 27, 32, and 58 in 
the DWC from SVD method.  Table 1 shows the relative gain array (RGA) analysis of these 
controlled stage temperatures and manipulated variables.  m1, m2, m3, and m4 represent the 
reactant A feed flow, reflux flow, sidedraw flow, and reboiler duty in the DWC, respectively.  
Hence the control loop pairing  is that the temperature at stage 31 in the RDC and the 
temperatures at 32, 58, 27 in the DWC are controlled by manipulating reactant A feed flow, 
reflux flow, sidedraw flow, and reboiler duty in the DWC, respectively.  Dynamic results 
show that the controlled stage temperatures can be settled at their corresponding set points 
under the +20% changes of reactant B feed rate or +10% changes of two vapor split ratios.  
However, three product purities cannot return to their desired values under the temperature 
control.

Variables

Fig. 4 gives the desired profiles of temperature changes for the RDC and DWC when 
reactant feed rates and VSR are increased or decreased by the amounts, 20% and 10%, 
respectively, under product purities kept as their designed values.  It shows the necessary 
temperature variations from nominal condition under external and internal disturbances and 
there is more influence for vapor split changes on the desired temperature profiles in the RDC 
and DWC.  This figure indicates that the set points of temperature control loops should be 
changed for product purities to be settled at designed values.  The necessary change for the 
controlled stage temperature in the RDC is relatively smaller than the necessary changes for 
the controlled stage temeratures in the DWC.  In the study, the set point of temperature loop 
in the RDC remains unchanged and the set points of temperature loops in the DWC are reset 
by cascade composition loops with C, D, and B product purities at distillate, side draw, and 
bottom, respectively as controlled variables and the set points of the inner temperature control 
loops as the manipulated variables.  RGA analysis, shown in Table 2, is also used to pair the

scheme.  It indicates that the set points of the temperature loops using T32(DWC), T58(DWC), and 
T27(DWC) as controlled variables should be reset by the composition loops using C, D, and B as 
controlled variables, respectively.  There are little interactions between the inner and outer 
loops of the cascade control scheme.  Fig. 5 shows the scheme of temperature control in the

5. CONCLUSIONS 
Reactive distillation and thermally coupled distillation are two promising technologies 
achieving substantial economical benefits from process intensification.  However, they 
represent different ways of integration.  In the study, thermally coupled reactive distillation, a 
technology combining reactive distillation and thermally coupled distillation, is performed to 
further enhance the advantages of both integration ways.  Processes with different degrees of 
coupling are designed to achieve possible energy saving for an ideal quaternary systems of 
types IR with excess design.  Four different thermal coupling structures are constructed by 
implementing partially or fully thermal coupling between columns. 
Steady-state analysis is used to select controlled and manipulated variables and 
determine their pairing.  A temperature control scheme in RDC is utilized to maintain 
stoichiometric balance between the reactant feeds.  Product purities can be maintained at their 
desired values by a temperature + composition cascade control scheme in the DWC under 
external and internal disturbances.
