GaAs based heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) have long been recognized as the 
leading device technology for high speed high power applications. The advantages of using 
InGaP HBTs over traditional LDMOSs include better efficiencies, higher operating 
frequencies and better linearity. We have recently demonstrated a 28V InGaP/GaAs power 
HBT with high efficiency and high linearity. [1] The BVcbo of the transistors was beyond 70 V. 
Kurpas et. al have also reported InGaP HBTs with high voltage capabilities.[2] However, 
HBTs, as in all bipolar devices, suffer from various feedback phenomena, which may cause 
instability and device failure in certain operating conditions. The most well known damaging 
effect is the “thermal runaway” caused by self-heating. [3-8] An approximate expression for 
the collector current under such electro-thermal feedback can be shown as  
)](exp[0 cecthbbeebec VIRIRIRVkT
qII φ+−−=       (1) 
where Rth is the thermal resistance and φ is the electro-thermal feedback coefficient, typically 
1.25mV/oC for GaAs. If there are multiple fingers, some of the fingers may go into the high 
current state and some into low current state causing the hot fingers to thermally run away. A 
simple way to alleviate this problem is to increase Re, or to add ballast resistors. [9-12] In 
normal operations where Ib is much smaller than Ie, the instability (or SOA) boundary is 
defined by, according to Eq.(1),

For transistors operated at high voltages, the impact ionization or avalanche effect is 
even more devastating can happen. When this happens in the collector, for an NPN transistor, 
the avalanche current results in a hole current back injected into the base. [13-17] This current 
can reverse the sign of the base current. It causes Vbe to drop and leads to device instability. 
For transistors with high BVcbo’s, the collector doping is usually low. When the injected 
carrier density exceeds the doping density, Kirk effect takes place and the location of the peak 
electric field shifts from the base-collector interface to the collector-subcollector interface 
where avalanche breakdown happens. Because the space charge concentration in the collector 
is d
s
c N
qv
J − , which increases with the current flowing through the collector, the impact 
ionization and avalanche breakdown will take place at a lower voltage as the current increases. 
The additional base current caused by the avalanche process can provide a feedback 
mechanism resulting in device failure.  
This mechanism can be seen clearly from the following expression for the collector 
current under breakdown condition,

enough to determine the device’s operation point in this space. All the allowed solutions are 
therefore represented by a surface in the 3-D plot. Here we take an example of an 
InGaP/GaAs NPN HBT with a collector thickness of 2.5 μm, which is uniformly doped to a 
doping concentration of 6 x 1015cm-3. The emitter size was assumed to be 3x8 μm2, the 
emitter resistance (including ballastor), base resistance and collector resistance were taken to 
be 50 ohm, 17 ohm and 2 ohm, respectively. The calculated I-V characteristics are shown in 
Fig. 1. The X and Y axes are taken as Vce and Ic while the Z axis is Vbe. This mountain-shaped 
surface represents the allowed operation points for the device. The mountain ridge, which 
runs from the high Ic, low Vce corner to the low Ic, high Vce corner, is the local maximum for 
Vbe and is the dividing line for the device’s safe operation and unstable operation. We can 
picture this as follows: if we bias the device with certain Vce and slowly increase the collector 
current, the Vbe value goes up until it reaches the ridge of the mountain. At this point, Vbe can 
no longer go any higher. If we let Vbe go down, there are two paths for the device to go down 
hill. In other words, there will be two solutions, one with a higher current and the other with a 
lower current once the device passes the ridge. So the device fails if its operation reaches the 
ridge. This ridge, which is a curve in our 3-D space, is therefore the SOA (safe operation area) 
boundary. The projections of the curve onto the Ic - Vce, Ic - Vbe and Vbe -Vce planes are the 
different representations of the SOA boundary in different coordinate systems. The calculated 
SOA boundary and its representations in the three planes for our example are shown in Fig.2. 
Since the SOA is usually shown as a curve in the Ic - Vce plane, we focus our following 
discussions on the representation on this plane. (however we need to bear in mind that the real 
curve should be in a 3-D space) First we did a set of calculations with constant Vbe inputs of 
1.25V, 1.3V, 1.4V, 1.5V and 1.6V. The calculated I-V curves are shown in Fig.3. For each 
curve there is a bend-over point, beyond which the device becomes unstable because each Vce 
/ Vbe pair gives two solutions. The connection of all the bend-over points is the SOA boundary, 
which is the same as the projection of the 3-D SOA curve on the Ic - Vce plane.  
To find out the root cause for instability, we show in Fig.4 the terminal base currents 
along with the I-V’s shown in Fig.3. As Vce increases, both Ic and Ib increase due to 
self-heating. When Vbe is high, higher than 1.3V in this case, Ib suddenly drops and goes to 
negative when the instability point is reached. This is the impact ionization or avalanche 
effect we mentioned earlier. The hole current generated by the avalanche process in the 
collector back injects into the base causing the reverse of the base current. Because the 
avalanche current easily overwhelms the base current, the base current reversal point is 
generally the instability point. Due to the Kirk effect, the breakdown voltage decreases as Vbe 
(or Ic) increases, the instability point (or the SOA boundary) takes place earlier (at lower Vce’s) 
when Vbe is higher. At a very low Vbe (e.g., 1.25V), the instability point happens before the 
reversal of the base current. This is because the instability is caused by self-heating not by the 
breakdown effect. As described earlier, both self-heating and avalanche effect can cause 
instability. The question is which one is the dominant effect at a given bias condition. In the 
example presented here, at Vbe = 1.25V, the breakdown voltage is higher than the thermal 
instability point shown in Eq. (2). So the device failure is controlled by the self-heating effect. 
But at higher Vbe’s, the breakdown voltage is reduced by the Kirk effect and becomes lower 
 6
Effects of emitter resistance and base resistance on SOAs 
It is well known that the use of emitter ballast resistors reduces transistors’ thermal 
instability. Its effect on the impact ionization caused SOA is the same. Based on Eq. 3, Re 
always provides a negative feedback that alleviates the positive feedback caused by 
self-heating and impact ionization. The role of base resistance on device stability is more 
complicated. If the SOA is controlled by self-heating alone, a higher base resistance would 
result in a better SOA the same way as the emitter resistor does. But if the SOA is controlled 
by impact ionization, because the avalanche current may reverse the base current, a higher 
base resistance would result in a worse SOA. 
Fig.8 shows the calculated SOA boundaries for Re = 50 ohm and 70 ohm. The SOAs 
caused by self-heating alone and breakdown effect alone are also shown for comparison. It 
can be seen that at high voltages, the SOAs are controlled by the thermal effect. But at high 
currents, because the Kirk effect reduces the breakdown voltage, the SOA boundaries move to 
much lower voltages and are controlled by the Kirk effect induced breakdown effect. The 
thermal SOA has a very strong dependence on Re, as discussed in Eq. 2. But its effect on the 
SOAs controlled by the KIB effect is much smaller. So the effect of emitter ballast resistors 
on high current SOAs is very limited. 
The base resistance plays two roles in SOAs. It increases the SOA when the device 
stability is governed by self-heating and avalanche effect is not a concern, but reduces the 
SOA when the opposite is true. Fig.9 shows the calculated SOAs for Rb = 0, 100, and 1000 
ohms. At high currents, the SOA is smaller as Rb increases. At low currents and high voltages, 
a high Rb, however, gives a better SOA. As explained earlier, the effect of Rb is similar to that 
of Re when there is no impact ionization in the collector. The effect, however, is reduced by a 
factor of the current gain because the voltage drop across the base resistance is proportional to 
the base current. So one has to use a very large base resistor as the ballastor in order to see 
any improvement in SOA. But, at high currents when the SOA is controlled by the KIB effect, 
we do not need to have a very large base resistance in order to see the degradation in SOA. 
Because of the back flow of the avalanche current going to the base terminal is directly 
controlled by the base resistance, a smaller change in base resistance can have a profound 
effect on the SOA. So in device applications, if one operates the device at high currents, it is 
important to avoid high base resistance. 
The calculation presented here has been used to fit the experimental results of our high 
voltage HBTs. The device consisted of 64 fingers. The collector was doped to a density of 6 x 
1015cm-3 and had a thickness of 3μm. Emitter ballast resistances of 70 ohm and 140 ohm were 
used. The measured SOAs and the calculated ones are shown in Fig.10. Very good agreement 
was obtained. The fact that the SOAs are pretty close to each other at high currents when very 
different ballast resistors are used can not be explained by self-heating alone. It is because 
that the failure mode was controlled by the KIB effect mentioned above.

failure is controlled by the KIB effect. Since the KIB effect depends on the doping structure 
of the collector, one can significantly improve the SOAs by properly design the doping profile 
in the collector.
