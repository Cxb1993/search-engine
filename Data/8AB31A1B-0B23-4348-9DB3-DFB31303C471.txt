chloride (99.8 %) and trichloromethane (99.4 %) (all Merck Co.), and drying agent anhydrous 
magnesium sulfate powder (J. T. Baker Co.) were obtained from the indicated suppliers. 
 
1-3.2. Measurements 
1H NMR and 13C NMR (700 MHz, VARIAN VNMRS-700) spectra were recorded of samples in 
CDCl3 with TMS as an internal standard. The molar masses of the polymers were measured with a 
gel permeation chromatograph (GPC, Viscotek-TDA) at 25℃, using trichloromethane as eluent and 
polystyrene as the standard reference; this GPC posesses multi detectors including a refractive 
index detector, a right angel laser light scattering detector, a low angel laser light scattering  
detector, a viscometer, and an UV detector.  
IR absorption spectra were recorded with a spectrometer Bomem DA8 FTIR or Nicolet Magna 
860 FTIR attached to the IR beamline at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in 
Taiwan, see Figure 2-S1 in Supporting Information; a HgCdTe or DTGS detector served to span the 
mid-IR range 500–4000 cm-1 or 400–4000 cm-1, respectively. The IR spectra were typically 
measured with resolution 0.5 cm-1 and 200–512 scans. Samples of polysquaraines were dissolved in 
trichloromethane. KBr discs were dipped in the samples as saturated solutions and subsequently 
dried in a vacuum oven to remove the solvent.  
Elemental analyses (Foss Heraeus CHN-O-Rapid), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA, TA Model, 
N2 atmosphere), and visible absorption spectra (Ocean Optics UV-visible spectrophotometer) were 
performed or measured with the indicated instruments. Photoluminescence spectra were obtained 
from a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrophotometer. 
 
1-3.3. Preparation of poly(1-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) 
  Poly(1-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) was synthesized on refluxing 1-octylpyrrole (1.1224 g, 6.26 
mmol) and squaric acid (0.714 g, 6.26 mmol) in equimolar proportions in a mixture of 1-butanol 
(60 mL) and benzene (30 mL) under a continuous flowing N2 atmosphere for 24 h [28,29 66-68]. 
The dark blue solutions obtained were filtered, and the filtrates were concentrated with vacuum 
distillation and poured into diethyl ether. The crude products were collected on filtration and 
washed with diethyl ether, before being redissolved in trichloromethane to yield solutions that were 
filtered again; the filtrates were evaporated to dryness in an open fume cupboard to eliminate the 
HCCl3. The precipitates were finally washed again with diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum 
chamber near 295 K for two days. 
The dark blue product of poly(1-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) was obtained with the yield 53 %.

6.26 mmol) and squaric acid (0.714 g, 6.26 mmol) according to the same process used to prepare 
poly(1-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) [29,66-68]; in which the product was obtained with the  yield

in the spectral range 400–4000 cm-1 (a) squaric 
acid; (b) 1-octylpyrrole; and (c) 3-octylpyrrole. 
 
  IR spectra of the P1 and P3 are divided into two regions. The left region, from 2700 to 3400 cm-1, 
contains strong absorptions attributed to C–H and N–H stretching modes. The intense lines 
observed between 2800 and 3000 cm-1 are assigned to C–H stretching modes of the octyl moiety in 
both polymers. Unlike the octyl group linked to –N atom in P1, P3 has its octyl group linked to 
a –C atom and shows a signal of the –NH group according to a –NH stretching mode near 3300 
cm-1 in Figure 1-1(b). 
  The right parts of the spectra, from 400 to 1750 cm-1, serve as ‘fingerprints’ of other functional 
groups and modes. The lines associated with carbonyl (–CO) functional groups in the intrinsic 
structural backbone of the polymer are typically discernible in the spectra. The covalent and 
zwitterionic –CO functional groups in polysquaraines have characteristic absorptions near 1750 
cm-1 and 1600 cm-1 [69-74], respectively; these values are smaller than the corresponding value 
1815 cm-1 of squaric acid.  
  As carbonyl moieties of these two kinds are thus distinguished directly in the IR spectra, we 
derive information about these dissimilar components in polymers on the basis of these lines. For 
instance, Figure 1-1 (b) shows a strong absorption at 1600 cm-1 and a weak one at 1742 cm-1; the 
intensity of the latter attributed to covalent carbonyl is about 3 % as that of the former associated 
with zwitterionic carbonyl. This result demonstrates that P3 possesses mostly zwitterionic repeating 
units in the polymer chain, so that it’s repeating units represented as n in Scheme 1-2 are about 97 
%. Even with the same procedures for the polycondensation, a variation of backbone structures 
might happen from batch to batch. To test this uncertainty, we prepared polysquaraines P3 for four 
batches, P3-1, P3-2, P3-3, and P3-4. The IR absorption spectra of P3-1, P3-2, P3-3, and P3-4 are 
compared in Figure 1-3; the shapes of these spectra are similar. The percentages of zwitterionic and 
covalent carbonyl backbones in polymer chains for these P3 polysquaraines are listed in Table 1-1. 
All these P3 polysquaraines possess mostly zwitterionic structures larger than 96 %.  
and a broad shoulder near 600 nm, as depicted in Figures 1-5 (a) and 1-6 (a), appearing blue in 
solution.

Figure 1-6. Visible absorption spectra of 
poly(pyrrolyl)squaraines, as synthesized, in 
non-hydrogen-bonding solvents: (a) P1; (b) P3. 
 
As discussed above, because P3 possesses mostly zwitterionic repeating units in its structure, the 
backbones tend to be identical and to bestow on its visible absorption only one narrow band, with 
maxima in various solvents listed in Table 1-2, whereas P1 contains two backbones in its polymer 
chain, so producing a more complicated absorption in its visible spectra.  Through comparison 
with the narrow absorption for zwitterionic P3, we assign the corresponding narrow band of P1, of 
which the maxima are also listed in Table 1-2, which we attribute to its zwitterionic moiety; the 
shoulder is due to its covalent part.

The wavelengths of the maximum visible absorptions of the polymers as synthesized varied with 
the solvent, possibly related to its polarity. The relative permittivity εr that is a measure of a solvent 
to separate charge and to orient a dipole is a useful parameter to describe the polarity of the solvent. 
Relations of the visible absorption maxima of P1 and P3 versus relative permittivity of HB solvents 
are displayed in Figure 1-7. As the wavenumbers of maximum absorption exhibit a linear shift with 
relative permittivity in the HB solvents [81,82], the visible absorption spectra of both polymers as 
synthesized exhibit significant negative solvatochromism [83-87]; i.e., the absorption exhibits a 
bathochromic effect with decreasing polarity in alcoholic solvents. The slopes of these relations for 
P3 and P1 are almost the same; the zwitterionic structures in these two polymers are hence similar, 
but for the same solvent the wave length of maximum absorption of P3 is blue-shifted relative to P1; 
this phenomenon reflects the fact that the mass ratio of the zwitterionic moiety in P3 is greater than 
the values for P3 are greater than those for P1. This occurrence also reveals the phenomenon that 
the mass ratio of the zwitterionic moiety in P3 is greater than that in P1.

1-4.5. Thermal stabilities of polysquaraines as synthesized 
For various applications the thermal stability of these polysquaraines is a matter of concern. As 
displayed in Figure 1-10, the TGA curves of P1 and P3 under N2 were recorded at heating rate 
15 ℃?/ min. Both polymers exhibited no loss of mass at temperature below 155 ℃?; when 
temperatures went up to 200.0 ℃?, the mass loss of P1 and P3 were 1.2 % and 0.8 %, respectively.

Figure 1-10. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of P1 (solid line) and P3 (dotted line) as

If we define the temperature at which mass loss is 5 ％? as Td, we obtain values 259.8 ℃? for P1 
and 270.1 ℃? for P3. For a temperature below 304 ℃?, the extent of mass loss of P1 is slightly 
greater than for P3, but above 304℃?, the mass loss of P3 increases more rapidly; this result 
indicates that the thermal degradation of P3 under the latter condition is more pronounced than that 
of P1. In the chain of polysquaraine, the covalent backbone is expected to be more stable than the 
zwitterionic one. As P1 comprises more covalent moieties than P3, P1 hence tends to resist thermal 
degradation above 304 ℃?. 
Further evidence of thermal stability for these two polymers was obtained from thermal tests 
monitored with IR spectra. We dipped polymers on the low-E plates and heated the plates in situ for 
IR measurements in the reflection mode. IR spectra of polysquaraines as synthesized in the spectral 
range 650–4000 cm-1 at various temperatures are shown in Figure 1-11 and 1-12.  
many areas of development. One of the most significant interests in developing a CP is that its 
optical, physical and electronic properties are affected strongly by a variation of the polymer 
conformation [97-100]. Development of a CP requires an understanding of its detailed structure and 
its variation under various manipulations. This topic has hence become a focus of research from 
both scientific and practical points of view. 
  Polysquaraines are zwitterionic dyes containing squaraines and π-conjugated polymers that are 
characterized by intense red absorption [25-27]; these compounds are suitable for the design of 
conducting polymers with small optical band gaps [34-40]. This possession of unique properties has 
made polysquaraines provide great sensitivity and optimal performance in such applications as 
communication and biosensors, etc. [46,48,51,101,102].    
  The optical, physical and electronic properties of CP are affected strongly by a variation of the 
polymer conformation because of excitonic interaction among the constituent chromophores. To 
optimize the performance, controlling the conformation is a critical issue for applications based on 
these materials. Preceding authors have investigated the variation of the structural conformation for 
squaraine-based materials through external stimuli by solvent concentration [58-60], solvent 
polarity [58,61,62], temperature [58,63], metal ions [49,64,65] and other conditions. Besides 
induction by these external stimuli, other techniques might control the conformation of 
polysquaraine. 
  A condensation of squaric acid with electron-donating aromatic compounds produces squaraines 
[28,30,103]. In one such reaction, squaric acid reacts with a pyrrole derivatives to form 
poly(pyrrolyl)squaraines [76], having either covalent or zwitterionic backbones, so differing in the 
chain of the polymer. The intrinsic molecular structure of polysquaraine is expected to influence 
strongly its stability and opto-electronic properties; for instance, as the positive moiety containing a 
N atom in the zwitterionic polysquaraine can bind to either a H atom or an alkyl group (R), this 
subtle local variation of molecular structure likely affects its chemical and physical properties.  
  Here we demonstrate that, besides induction by metal ions, the structure of 
poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine having a zwitterionic repeating unit is variable when its solution in 
trichloromethane makes contact with the surface of an active metal. A possible structural alteration 
of this CP is thus a reversible isomerization from a linear conformer to a folded one induced with an 
active metal surface. This observation has no precedent; our findings provide an impetus for further 
investigation of the structural modification of similar CP and the structural dynamics of their 
polymer chains in solution.

2-3.2. Preparation of poly(octylpyrrole)squaraine 
To synthesize poly(octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid), 1-octylpyrrole or 3-octylpyrrole (1.1224 g, 6.26 
mmol) and squaric acid (0.714 g, 6.26 mmol) in equimolar proportions were refluxed in a mixture

poly(3-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) are denoted with formulae I and II, respectively. 
Polysquaraines are described as having π-conjugated structures that typically possess intense 
absorption in the visible range. Figure 2-1 displays the visible spectra of poly(pyrrolyl)squaraines in 
trichloromethane; poly(1-octylpyrrolyl)squaraine (P1) and poly(3-octylpyrrolyl)squaraine (P3) 
exhibit distinct features in their visible spectra.

poly(1-octylpyrrolyl)squaraine (P1); (B) poly(3-octylpyrrolyl)squaraine (P3). The insets show 
the molecular structures of P1 and P3; P1 consists of repeating units of covalent and 
zwitterionic structural backbone in a ratio 1:2, whereas P3 possesses mostly zwitterionic 
repeating units (>97 %). 
 
The visible absorption of zwitterionic P3 in trichloromethane exhibited a single and narrow 
absorption band centred at 543.6 nm, producing a magenta color in solution, whereas P1 has a line 
with maximum absorption at 547.9 nm and a broad shoulder near 600 nm, resembling navy blue in 
solution. 
As reported in the section B [104], because P3 as synthesized possesses mostly zwitterionic 
repeating units in its structure, the backbones tend to be identical and to bestow on its visible 
absorption only one narrow band, whereas P1 contains backbones of two types in its polymer chain, 
so producing a more complicated absorption in its visible spectrum. Through comparison with the 
narrow absorption for zwitterionic P3, we deduce the corresponding narrow band of P1 to imply its 
zwitterionic moiety; the shoulder is due to its covalent part.  
 
2-4.1. Visible absorption spectra of P1 and P3 in trichloromethane solution inserted with 
metals  
In most electronic devices, connection to a metal surface or contact through opto-electronic 
materials is generally unavoidable. Because metals used in devices are typically rigid, these 
materials, including conducting polymers, tend to be considered stable when they bond to a metal or 
are in contact with its surface. The physical and chemical properties of CP are poorly explored and 
understood; an assumption of a CP being inactive towards a metal should be verified before we 
accept it as common knowledge. 
The strengths and shapes of the visible absorption features of P1 and P3 in a silica cell remained 
constant for over seven days; these polymers hence appear to be stable in trichloromethane solution. 
With a polymer solution as blank for comparison, we inserted metal plates or gauzes into the silica 
cells and monitored the visible absorption of the polymer solutions as a function of time. For

When we inserted a Cu plate into a solution of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine, the visible 
absorption spectra of these polymer solutions altered more profoundly. Figure 3-6 illustrates the 
temporal variation of visible absorption spectra for the case of a Cu plate (surface area 382 mm2) at 
295 K; over 40 h the original spectral feature with maximum absorption at 543.6 nm gradually 
decreased, and became replaced with another broad feature with a maximum at 513.8 nm. All these 
spectra retain an isosbestic point at 525.8 nm. The inset photograph in Figure 2-6 displays the 
distinct color change from pale magenta before insertion of the copper plate to pale orange 
afterward. 
For these active metals, the relative rates of variation of the spectra of 
poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine solution are derived from the decrease of absorbance at 543.6 nm 
during the same periods. The corresponding rates relative to that for copper are listed in Table 2-1. 
Among these active metals, copper is most active, and iron second: the rate for iron is about 0.37 
that for copper. Relative to the rate for copper, the rates for other metals are Rh 0.21, Ag 0.09, Pt 
0.08, Zn 0.06, and Pb 0.03. Although copper and iron are metals commonly used in electronic 
devices, nobody expects that these two metals would effect a color change of this kind for a CP.

2-4.4. Reversibility of the color change induced by metal  
A notable feature of the transformation of visible absorption of this zwitterionic polymer with 
metals is its reversibility. After the absorption at 543.6 nm became replaced with the feature at 
513.8 nm induced by metals, the reverse shift from 513.8 nm to 543.6 nm occurred on removal of 
the metals from the solution.  
Figure 2-9 shows this phenomenon; on removal of the copper plates from the solution after 
insertion for 11 h, the absorption at 513.8 nm of the polymer solution with the Cu plates became 
replaced with the band at 543.6 nm. The temporal variation of these spectra preserves the same 
isosbestic point at 525.8 nm. This reversibility of absorption behavior implies that the polymer, 
without the metal in contact with its solution, reverted to its original conformation.

The adsorbed polymer might desorb from the surface from random movements or collisions and 
maintain its linear conformation in solution, but, while the zwitterionic polymer is anchored at one 
end on the metal surface, the other terminus of the polymer chain remains free to move in the 
solution. The polymer chain would swing back and forth and might fold its structure. If an energy 
term for the folded conformation compensates the entropy term, this conformation might be stable 
and exist in solution for a protracted period. The zwitterionic poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine has 
alternately negatively charged -O- and positively charged -NH+ moieties that might interact in the 
folded conformation. The closure might cause the -O- and the -NH+ moieties to attract each other 
and to bind together through hydrogen bonds. Scheme 2-3 illustrates the proposal molecular 
structures of the reversible isomerization of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine induced by an active 
metal; the internal hydrogen bonds are schematically depicted in the folded conformation.

2-3.6 Evidence of folding structure from IR absorption spectra 
According to Scheme 2-3, we perceive that internal hydrogen bonds might be formed in the 
folded structure of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine. Such a formation of hydrogen bonds might play a 
key role in this closure. Information about the structure of this polysquaraine in solution might be 
derived from infrared spectra. As shown in Figure 3-12, although trichloromethane absorbs strongly 
in the mid IR region, so interfering with measurements of dissolved samples, it is still possible to 
obtain useful IR absorption spectra of liquid samples by careful subtraction of the absorption by the 
solvent. Figure 2-13 presents the IR net absorbance of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine between 
solutions without, in 2-13 (A), or with, in 2-13 (B), contact with a Cu plate, relative to the solvent. 
Apart from artefacts produced by imperfect subtraction of trichloromethane in both spectra, the 
significant feature located at 1602 cm-1 belongs to the functional group of the zwitterionic carbonyl 
of this polysquaraine sample [75,78,80,104]. A notable difference between these two spectra is a 
line at 3364 cm-1 that appears only in Figure 2-13 (B), and that is assigned to an OH stretching 
mode of a intra-hydrogen bond [109].  As discussed above, the carrier sample of 
poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine in trichloromethane is postulated to exist as a linear form (formula 
III) that contains no OH functional group, consistent with its absence from Figure 2-13 (A), 
whereas in the presence of the copper plate this polysquaraine sample has a folded structure 
(formula IV); the negatively charged -O- then binds to positively charged -NH+ to form a internal 
hydrogen bond, revealed through its OH stretching mode at 3364 cm-1 in Figure 2-13 (B). The 
evidence from the IR spectra is thus consistent with a folded conformation of this polysquaraine 
sample induced by active metal surfaces, as demonstrated in Scheme 2-3.

Figure 2-14. SAXS profiles of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine in trichloromethane solution in a 
copper cell at initial (solid line) and final (dotted line) stages. The inset depicts relations of ln 
I(q) versus q2 for small q at initial (solid line) and final (dotted line) stages. 
 
The SAXS curve of the polymer solution in the copper cell at the initial stage, displayed as a 
solid line, was similar to that in the stainless steel cell; it gradually altered and eventually became 
the dotted curve in Figure 2-14. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the polymer is determined from the 
plot of ln I(q) versus q2 in the range of small q; the value of Rg thus extracted from the slope 
(-Rg2/3) of this plot [110,111], as shown in the insert of Figure 2-14, was (21±2) nm and (16±2) nm 
in the copper cell at the initial and final stages, respectively. The result is consistent with two 
conformers existing in solution and with our folded model. 
 
2-4.8. Possible mechanisms for isomerization 
Summarizing the above, we observed reversible changes in visible absorption, IR absorption and 
SAXS spectra of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine in solution in contact with particular metals; we 
postulate that the effects reflect conformational isomerization of this conducting polymer induced 
by metals. One mechanism that might explain these spectral changes is the chemical oxidation of 
the polymer chains by either dissolved metal ions or oxidation of the polymer chains by dissolved 
oxygen at the metal surfaces. 
Zwitterionic organic dyes act as ligands and react with metal ions to form stable complexes, 
resulting in altered optical properties. As synthesized, poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine reacts thus with 
metal ions; the color of its solution alters concurrently. To test the role of metal ions, we added cations 
to similar polymer solution.  
On reaction of our poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine, as synthesized, with Cu2+ cation in 
trichloromethane solution, the absorption maximum gradually shifted with time from 543.6 nm to 
524.0 nm; the intensity of the former band correspondingly decreased, as shown in Figure 2-15. For 
this reaction we prepared a saturated solution of Cu2+ in HCCl3 over Cu(ClO4)y6H2O. The curves of 
these spectra intersect at 531.2 nm, an isosbestic point.  
Thus either poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine reacted with Cu2+ ion in trichloromethane or the metal 
ion altered the structure of this zwitterionic polymer, in either case to shift the absorption band of 
poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine. Scheme 2-4 illustrates the proposed transformation of the molecular 
structure of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine caused by Cu2+; the linear backbone of this polymer 
represented as formula III converts to a folded complex with Cu2+ ion as formula V. In such 
modification of conformation caused by a cation, the metal ion plays a key role. 
conformational change of this CP induced by a metal being due to a metal ion that is dissolved from 
the metal. 
In addition, although this polysquaraine solution exhibited a similar variation of the conformation 
induced by both cations and some active metal plates, but this zwitterionic polymer folds its 
structure in two distinct ways. While the polysquaraine reacts with a cation and folds its structure, 
the negative charge of –O- binds to the cation; in this case, no OH group is be formed in the 
complex. The difference IR absorption spectrum of poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine with added Cu2+ 
cations in trichloromethane is shown in Figure 2-17; compared to Figure 2-13 (B), this IR 
absorption spectrum possessed no such OH band. The evidence from the IR spectra thus further 
confirms the distinct conformational changes of this polysquaraine sample induced by cations and 
by the surfaces of active metals.

An analogous argument of reversible and irreversible processes applies also to oxidation of the 
polymer from oxygen dissolved at the metal surfaces: a conformational change caused by such 
oxidation would be irreversible. Without adding a reductant, the oxidation product would not be 
reduced to its original form. The intrinsic irreversibility of an oxidation mechanism is inconsistent 
with the reversible observation and must be excluded. 
 
2-4.9. Photoluminescent spectra of linear and folded conformers 
The conformation of the zwitterionic polysquaraine is thus reversible, back and forth, depending 
on the presence or absence of an active metal. We thus reversibly control the conformation of this 
CP with this simple heterogeneous process without altering the chemical environment in solution, 
whereas adding metal ions to the polymer solution causes an irreversible change of the chemical 
environment and the structure for this CP.  
The isomerization of this polysquaraine induced with a metal surface modified the optical 
properties, not only the visible absorption spectra described above but also the emission spectra. 
Figure 2-18 displays photoluminescent spectra (PL) of this polymer in trichloromethane; the 
emission maximum shifted from 562 nm to 557 nm accompanying the conformational change 
induced with the copper plate.  
The quantum yield of this polysquaraine with the linear structural conformation reduced to 47% 
as that of folded one. Regarding the PL yields for comparison, we used 2,3-benzanthracene as an 
external standard under the same optical conditions. Based on the PL intensity of 
2-4.11. Manipulation of the durations of forward and reverse isomerizations 
The observation of this reversible structural modification accompanying the optical alterations 
for the zwitterionic polysquaraine induced by active metal surface is unprecedented; it represents a 
new chemical and physical process. This optical-switching property of a CP induced by active 
metals has prospective applications. Our findings provide an impetus for the investigation of the 
structural modification of similar CP and the structural dynamics of their polymer chains in 
solution. 
As shown in Figure 2-6, the forward isomerization of the target polymer in trichloromethane was 
completed longer than 40 h by inserted a copper plate (surface area 382 mm2) at 295 K. For the 
forward transformation, increasing the surface area of metal and temperature decreases the duration 
of reaction. By increasing the surface area, we thus can reduce the forward reaction time. Figure 
2-21 shows that the forward isomerization completed in 6 h with surface area 1720 mm2 of copper 
plates at 296 K.

inserted a copper plate (surface area 1720 mm2) at 296 K: before addition (black curve) and 6 h 
after addition (green curve). 
 
The reaction time of forward isomerization could even be reduced by using gauzes.  For 
example, with Cu gauze (100 mesh, diameter 0.11 mm and mass 2.133 g) in a cell of liquid volume 
3 mL and optical path of length 1.0 cm, the change was completed in 60 min at 296 K, as displayed 
in Figure 3-22.  Increasing the temperature could reduce the forward time further, with the same 
Cu gauze (100 mesh, diameter 0.11 mm and mass 2.133 g) in a cell of liquid volume 3 mL, the 
change was completed in less than 30 min at 323 K. 
For the reverse transformation in the free solution, increasing the temperature decreases the 
duration of unfolding. As shown in Figure 2-9, the backward isomerization time was over 22 h at 
323 K. Thus, the reverse transformation in the free solution is slow. Strikingly, ultrasonic agitation 
to perturb the folded polymer solution also decreases the duration profoundly: we found that only 
25 min was required to accomplish the reversal with ultrasonic agitation, as shown in Figure 2-23.  
We believe the response periods of the transformations might be further decreased with improved 
technique. This reversible behavior accompanying color changes hence endows materials of this 
type with a great prospective capability for display applications or information storage, and might 
lead to the development of other significant applications. For example, by means of this mechanism, 
an optical switch might be achievable in the liquid state. 
This reversible phenomenon encourages the discovery of further knowledge about the 
interactions of polymers with metallic surfaces, and about the dynamics and energetics of 
conformational changes of polymers. We expect our findings to motivate the investigation of 
conformational modifications of other CP and applications of this phenomenon. Applying these 
polymer solutions onto substrates might enable these CP to retain their specific structures in the 
solid after removal of solvent. The properties and applications of these switchable films or materials 
observations of these optical and thermal properties were reconciled to their structures. 
The optical, physical and electronic properties of CP are affected strongly by a variation of the 
polymer conformation because of excitonic interaction among the constituent chromophores. To 
optimize the performance, controlling the conformation is a critical issue for applications based on 
these materials. Preceding workers have investigated the variation of the structural conformation for 
squaraine-based materials through solvent concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, metal ions 
and other conditions. Besides induction by these external stimuli, we found that the conformation of 
polysquaraine can be controlled by active metals. 
We synthesized the target CP poly(3-octylpyrrolyl)squaraine to possess mostly zwitterionic 
repeating units. Accompanied by color changes, the conformational structure of the carrier was 
altered on adding metal ions to solutions of the polymer and also induced by some active metals. 
Active metals induce a variation of the conformation of zwitterionic conducting polymer 
poly(3-octylpyrrole)squaraine in trichloromethane solution.  
Evidence from infrared, visible and photoluminescent spectra and from small-angle X-ray 
scattering profiles unambiguously confirms the isomerization of this polysquaraine induced by the 
surfaces of active metals. Unlike the irreversible change induced by cations in solution, the folded 
conformation induced by active metals reverts to its original structure on eliminating contact 
between the metals and the solution.  
This observation of a reversible structural modification, accompanying altered optical properties, 
for the zwitterionic polysquaraine induced by active metal plates is unprecedented; it represents a 
new chemical and physical process, and it has a potential to lead to the discovery of significant 
knowledge about the interactions of polymers with metal surfaces, the dynamics and the energetics 
of polymer conformations. This observation of a reversible conformation for a zwitterionic polymer 
induced by a metallic surface provides an impetus to investigate both such a structural modification 
of other CP and applications of this phenomenon.

Part II. Polysquaraine Enhancing  the Holographic Optical Data Storage of  
PMMA/ PQ Photopolymers 
 
1.Abstract 
In this study, we synthesized poly(3-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) (PSQ3), a polysquaraine, 
through the reaction of 3-octylpyrrole and squaric acid, and then co-doped it with 
phenanthrenequinone (PQ) into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to improve the holographic 
data storage characteristics of the photopolymer. The photopolymers co-doped with relatively small 
amounts of PSQ3 exhibited greatly improved holographic recording characteristics, including 
superior diffraction efficiency and dynamic range (M#). Among the samples co-doped with PQ and 
PSQ3, the maximum diffraction efficiency reached 54.8% (cf. 9.0% for PMMA/PQ) without further 
downgrade and the value of M# reached 1.05 (cf. 0.46 for PMMA/PQ). Therefore, the holographic 
data storage characteristics of the photopolymer PMMA/PQ were improved through co-doping with 
PSQ3. 
 
2. Introduction 
Holographic data storage is one of the most promising next-generation data storage technologies 
because it combines large storage capacities with fast data access rates. Photopolymer recording 
materials are particularly attractive for holographic recording applications [1–6]; compared with 
inorganic materials, photopolymers can provide larger refractive index modulation, higher 
sensitivity, and better flexibility in terms of composition. In previous studies, we found that 
9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ)–doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) serves as a good 
recording material for holographic data storage [6–9]. During such a holographic recording process, 
the PQ molecules absorb energy to form an excited state, which undergoes further transfer to a 
radical state that reacts with residual MMA monomer to form the photoproduct; at the same time, a 
modulated refractive index change occurs [10]. Faster photoreaction processes and larger modulated 
refractive index changes of the photopolymer are expected to result in superior holographic 
recording characteristics. 
Polysquaraines are pi-conjugated polymers that possess consecutive donor/acceptor repeating 
units in the polymer chain [11,12]; they feature considerable charge-transfer interactions, which 
could be used to affect the photoreaction between PQ and MMA and, thereby, improve the 
holographic characteristics. In this study, we synthesized poly(3-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) 
(PSQ3) and co-doped it with PQ into PMMA as the photopolymer. We used a UV–Vis spectrometer 
and an Abbe refractometer to measure the optical absorption and refractive index data, respectively. 
From a study of the holographic recording characteristics of the photopolymer incorporating 
different doped concentrations of PSQ3, we found that the co-doped polysquaraine improved the 
dynamic range and sensitivity of the photopolymer. 
 
3. Experimental 
3.1 Materials 
High-purity 3-octylpyrrole and squaric acid were obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry and 
Acros Organics, respectively. Benzene was acquired from Showa Chemical. Butyl alcohol, ethyl 
ether, and CH2Cl2 were purchased from Echo Chemical Company. PMMA powder (average 
molecular weight: 120,000) was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. PQ was acquired from Tokyo 
Chemical Industry and used as received. 
 
3.2 Poly(3-octylpyrrole-co-squaric acid) (PSQ3) 
3-Octylpyrrole (0.5 mmol) and squaric acid (0.5 mmol) were heated under reflux in benzene (10 
mL) and butyl alcohol (20 mL) under a N2 atmosphere with stirring for 24 h, with azeotropic 
removal of water in a Dean–Stark apparatus [11, 13]. After cooling, the mixture was concentrated 
under vacuum and the product poured into ethyl ether. The precipitate was collected by filtration; 
2800–3000 cm–1 [16]. The broad absorption band at 3300 cm–1 was produced as a result of 
intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the PSQ3 structures. These spectral features were consistent 
with the proposed structure of PSQ3. 
 
Figure 2. FTIR spectra of PSQ3. 
 
4.2 Optical chemical measurements 
Figure 3 presents typical optical absorption spectra of the various photopolymers before and after 
exposure. PSQ3 itself exhibited its maximum absorption at 549 nm. Prior to exposure, the 
photopolymers co-doped with PSQ3 all provided similar absorption curves. All of the samples had 
lower absorbance at 514 nm than they did at 532 nm. Notably, the absorption coefficients at 514 and 
549 nm increased upon increasing the doped content of PSQ3. After exposure to green light (514 
nm), the entire absorption band of the each photopolymer underwent a blue shift. At the same time, 
the absorption peak of PSQ3 disappeared, predictably because PSQ3 reacted with PQ and PMMA 
to form various photoproducts [10, 17-18]. This substantial variation in absorbance was clearly 
different from that of the unmodified PMMA/PQ photopolymer. To monitor the effect of co-doping 
PSQ3 in the PMMA/PQ photopolymer in terms of the holographic data storage characteristics, we 
selected 514 nm as the recording wavelength for our subsequent studies.

Figure 5. Running curves for multiple-hologram recording in the photopolymers. 
 
  Figure 5 displays the running curves for multiple-hologram recording in PMMA/PQ 
photopolymers co-doped with PSQ3. Each curve reached saturation when the exposure energy 
exceeded a certain value. Using the formulas above for curve-fitting, we obtained the values of M#, 
Eτ, and S listed in Table 2. All of the photopolymers co-doped with PSQ3 had higher values of M# 
and S than did the PQ-only doped photopolymer. The PMMA/PQ/0.1 wt% PSQ3 photopolymer 
exhibited the highest value of M# (1.05) among all of the tested samples (cf. 0.47 for PMMA/PQ). 
Moreover, the value of S of the PMMA/PQ/0.1 wt% PSQ3 system was 2.6 times greater than that of 
the PMMA/PQ photopolymer.

  These experimental results reveal that co-doping with PSQ3 enhanced the holographic data 
storage characteristics of the PMMA/PQ photopolymer system. Upon exposure to light, the 
conjugated structure of PSQ3 predictably changed or was destroyed; the absorption peaks of PSQ3 
disappeared, consistent with its having undergone photochemical reactions with PQ and PMMA. In 
which the C-O group of PSQ3 was reaction with the PMMA [17,18], and the C=C of PSQ3 was 
furthermore reacted with the C=O group of PQ [10]. These new photoproducts would be different 
from those in the PMMA/PQ sample, providing a larger refractive index change and superior 
holographic recording performance. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Part III. Effect of Ionic Liquid on Structure and Properties of Polysquaraine 
 
1.Abstract 
An ionic liquid [Oct3NMe][TfO] was used as an polymerionic stabilizer in polysquaraine 
preparation. The ionic liquid (IL) plays an important role on structure and properties of 
polysquaraine (SQ12). With increasing concentration of IL, the ratio of 1,3- and 1,2- structure 
intensity was grandly increased, and the hypochromic effect of SQIx in nonpolar solvent were 
observed. Adding marginal IL to SQ12 can improve film forming ability and film conductivity 
(SQIx).  
 
2. Introduction 
π-conjugated polymer in general have intense absorption in the visible to the near-IR region, 
which are associated with the donor-acceptor-donor-type charge-transfer interaction [1]. Because of 
their unique optoelectronic properties and intrinsic conductivity, squaraine have been extensively 
studied. However, the intrinsic aggregation and insoluble behavior were observed in our present 
work. It is known that ionic liquids are often considered as promising solvent replacements for 
volatile organic compounds(VOCs), and its zwitterions structure feature cause our interesting. We 
expected that ionic liquid (IL) can greatly improve the solubility and facilitate a decreased tendency 
for aggregation. Here, we investigate the influence of IL effect on the squaraine that removing of 
ionic liquid by ethanol, and their impact on the morphology and conductivity. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
The poly(1,4-bis[2-(1-methylpyrrole-2-yl)vinyl]-2,5-didodecyloxybenzene)squarine (SQ12) was 
synthesized following the standard procedure of squaraine dye [1,2], thus generating zwitterionic 
π-conjugated polymer with quinoid resonance structure, invoking strong charge-transfer 
interaction(Fig.1). IL was addition to SQ reaction solution to improve the aggregation behavior.

structure showed within the dotted line. 
 
  Structure analysis based on FT-IR.  Bispyrrole derivative reacts with squaric acid might 
generate two types of repeating units consisting of a 1,3-substituted zwitterionic and 1,2-substituted 
diketionic structure. The 1,3-zwitterionic and 1,2-diketionic －CO functional groups has been 
previously discussed [3-6] and absorption near 1750 and 1600 cm-1. IR spectra of SQ12 showed a 
strong peak at 1622 cm-1 and 1716 cm-1, which are characteristic of 1,3-zwitterionic and 
1,2-diketionic carbonyl, respectively. The IR data of SQ12 and SQIx (Fig. 2) exhibit the same 
spectroscopic feature and IL characteristic absorption has disappeared, which indicates the removal 
of the IL from the final polymer product (SQIx). On the other hand, SQ12 was comparable with 
those of the SQIx (removing of IL by EtOH), the ratio of 1,3-zwitterionic and 1,2-diketonic 
structure intensity was predominant (Table 1). With increasing concentration of IL, accompanied by 
an increase in the ratio of 1,3- and 1,2-structure intensity, In other words, 1,2-diketionic structure

Electronic Absorption Spectral Proteries. The absorption spectral changes of SQ12 and SQIx 
are shown in Fig. 5. The absorption of SQIx in co-solvent showed relatively narrower band (Fig. 5A) 
than those that removing of IL, probably attributed to the dipole-dipole interaction between IL 
(cation and anion) and zwitterionic SQ polymer, and the shoulder on Fig. 5(B) curve a and b 
indicated that might due to n-BuOH characteristic absorption. In addition, with increasing 
concentration of the IL, the absorption band was gradually narrowed, which could due to the 
enhanced acidity of reaction solution. Further evidence supported that absorption peak of SQI0.01 in 
n-BuOH/Benzene co-solvent was included the characteristic peak in both individual solvents (Fig. 
6A curve c), namely, the shoulder on Fig. 5(B) was attributed to characteristic absorption in 
n-BuOH. Besides, the maxima absorption of SQI0.01 and SQI5 in Benzene were narrower compared 
to BuOH, the solvent effect on SQI0.01 was more significant than on SQI5. It might be result from 
the change of polymer in chain between their protonated cationic form (nonplanar) and 
deprotonated anionic form (planar) in the hypochromic effect [7]. The absorption maximum of neat 
SQ12 showed hypsochromic shift behavior (Fig. 7(A)), which can be explained on the basis of the 
enhanced acidity of n-BuOH compared to Benzene. On the other hand, in the case of SQI5 showed 
significantly different solvatochromic behavior was observed (Fig. 7(B)). With increased co-solvent 
polarity, the absorption maxima of SQI5 was displayed a significant red shift broad band, similarity 
to deprotonated anion form feature[8], might affected by the hydrogen bond between anion of IL 
and n-BuOH. A more detailed discussion of solvent effect is in progress.
