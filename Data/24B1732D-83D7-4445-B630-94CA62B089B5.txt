Characterization of the films.— The crystal structure of the
films was examined by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction XRD,
MacScience MXP3 X-ray diffractometer, which was operated at 40
kV and 150 mA using Cu K radiation.
The surface morphology and cross section structure of the films
were observed using an atomic force microscope AFM, model
Seiko SPA400, and a field-emission-scanning electron microscope
FESEM, JEOL JSM-6700F, operated at 3.0 kV. The microstructure
was investigated by using a transmission electron microscope
TEM, JEM-1200, 120 kV. The ZnO thin films deposited on glass
substrate were prepared for TEM observation by the precision ion
polishing system Ion Million Gatan 691.
The chemical composition of the films was analyzed using an
X-ray photoelectron spectroscope XPS, ULVAC-PHI 5000, com-
bined with 4 keV Ar+ sputter depth profiling. A standard X-ray
source, 15 kV, 25 W, Al K h = 1486.6 eV was used. Binding
energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
Results and Discussion
Effect of pH with acid addition.— In general, a reaction occurs
when an acid is dissolved in water; a proton H+ is transferred from
the acids to water. Aqueous HCl is a strong acid, which means that
almost all the original HCl is dissociated or ionized in water. How-
ever, HCOOH and CH3COOH are only partially ionized in water;
therefore, the aqueous solution of HCOOH and CH3COOH are
weak acids. In addition, the acid strength of CH3COOH is weaker
than HCOOH due to the acid dissociation constant Ka of aqueous
CH3COOH, which is 1.7  10−5mol dm−3 pKa 4.77, which is
smaller than that of aqueous HCOOH 1.6  10−4mol dm−3
pKa 3.80.24 In this study, in preparing the precursor colloids with
various pH values, a pH ranging below 7.0, the varied acids, i.e.,
HCl, HCOOH, and CH3COOH, with different acid strengths were
adopted to be used as acid agents.
The initial pH of the raw colloid, without adding any acid agent,
is 5.9. After adding an acid agent, the pH of the precursor colloid
decreases. Figure 1 shows the variation in the pH of the precursor
colloids as a function of the moles of the acid agent. In Fig. 1, it can
be seen that the influence of the HCl agent on the pH of the precur-
sor colloid is stronger than that of the HAc and HCOOH agents
employed. Only 0.01 mol of HCl was added, the pH of the colloid
abruptly decreased to 0.1. However, when adding the same amount
of HAc and HCOOH, the pH of the HAc and HCOOH colloids
decreased to 3.6 and 2.5, respectively. In addition, the pH range of
the HCOOH colloids, in which the amount of HCOOH was in-
creased from 0.01 to 0.10 moles, is 2.5–0.5. Whereas, for the HAc
colloids, while the same acid amount was increased, the pH spans
from 3.6 to 2.2.
XRD analysis.— Figure 2a shows the XRD spectrum of the ZnO
film prepared with raw colloidpH 5.9, and Fig. 2b-d represents the
XRD spectra of the films prepared with the HAc colloids of pH 3.6,
2.8, and 2.5, respectively. Figure 2e-g shows the spectra of the films
prepared with the HCOOH colloids of pH 2.0, 1.1, and 0.5, and Fig.
2h represents that of the film prepared with the HCl colloid of pH
0.1.
All of the films exhibit a ZnO crystalline phase with a hexagonal
wurtzite structure, and have three main peaks corresponding to
100, 002, and 101 planes, along with small peaks for the 102
and 110 planes. Furthermore, the preferred orientation of the raw
colloid’s film displays a 101 peak. However, when the films were
prepared with the precursor colloids in which the pH is above 2.0,
such as HAc colloids of pH 3.6, 2.8, 2.5, and HCOOH colloidpH 2.0,
the preferred orientation of the films changes to the 002 plane. In
addition, those of the films prepared with the HCOOH colloidpH 1.1,
HCOOH colloidpH 0.5, and HCl colloidpH 0.1 change to a preferred
101 orientation. This result suggests that the microstructure of the
acid colloid’s ZnO films was influenced by the pH of the precursor
colloids.
The average crystallite size of the ZnO films can be calculated
using Scherrer’s equation, D = 0.94/ cos , where  is the X-ray
wavelength,  is the full width at half-maximum fwhm of the
diffraction line, and  is the diffraction angle.25,26 Table I shows the
results calculated from the diffraction peaks. The results indicate
that the crystallite size of the films prepared with the precursor col-
loids with a pH value above 1.0 is about 15–20 nm. The films were
prepared with the HCOOH colloidpH 0.5 and HCl colloidpH 0.1;
their calculated crystallite size slightly decreases to about 10–12 nm.
FESEM analysis.— The pH effect of the precursor colloids on
the microstructure of the ZnO films can be further understood using
the FESEM analysis. Figure 3 represents the FESEM images of
plane-view and cross-sectional ZnO films prepared with raw, HAc,
and HCl colloids. The raw colloid’s film exhibits a surface with
small and roundlike crystallites, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. When
adding the acetic acid, the surface of the films that were prepared
with the HAc colloids of pH 3.6, 2.8, 2.5, and 2.2 displays a similar
morphology to that of the raw colloid’s film, and the images of the
HAc colloidpH 2.5 film are shown in Fig. 3c and d. Figure 3e and f
shows the film prepared with HCl colloidpH 0.1, in which it can be
seen that numbers of the large crystallites with a crystallite size of
about 500–1000 nm randomly appear on the bottom layer, and some

prepared with the precursor colloids with pH above 2.0 exhibit simi-
lar crystal types; the main feature of the crystallites is that they are
small and round, with a crystallite size ca. 20 nm, which corre-
sponds to that estimated using the fwhm of the XRD spectra esti-
mated crystallite sizes of 15–20 nm. However, when the precursor
colloids decrease to below pH 1.0, the main appearance of the coat-
ings consists of large crystallites with sizes of 500–1000 nm, which
have grown on the surface of the fine ZnO crystallite bottom layer.
The crystallite sizes of the fine and large crystallites of these ZnO
coatings measured from the FESEM images are also given in Table
I. The measured sizes of the fine crystallites existing in the coatings
are coincidental to those estimated using the XRD spectra esti-
mated crystallite sizes of 10–12 nm. Therefore, the results of the
XRD and FESEM analyses confirm that the fine ZnO polycrystallite
layer is responsible for the observed boarding of the XRD peaks.
AFM analysis.— AFM analysis was also conducted to further
clarify the influence of the pH of the precursor colloids on the sur-
face morphology of the ZnO films and coatings. Figure 5 shows the
AFM images of the ZnO films prepared with HCOOH colloids with
variant pH values. It was found that the root-mean-square rms
surface roughness of the film prepared with the raw colloidpH 5.9 is
about 13.7 nm and that the rms value of the film varied after adding
the acid agent. The rms values of the films prepared with the
HCOOH colloids of pH 2.5 and 2.0 are slightly lower than that of
the raw colloid’s film. This indicates that the surface of the films of
pH 2.5 and 2.0 is much smoother than that of the raw colloid’s film.
However, for the coatings prepared with pH 1.1 and 0.5 colloids, the
rms values of the coatings are much higher than that of the raw
colloid’s film and also considerably rougher than those of the films
prepared with the precursor colloids with pH above 2.0.
The variation in the rms surface roughness of the films or coat-
ings as a function of the pH of the HCOOH colloids is shown in Fig.
6. The results of Fig. 6 reveal that adjusting the pH value of the
acidity precursor colloids between 2.5 and 2.0 can decrease the av-
erage rms of the films to ca. 8.4 nm. If the pH of the colloids is
adjusted between 2.0 and 1.0, the rms of the films increases to about
20.5 nm, and when the pH of the colloids is further decreased to
below 1.0, the roughness of the coatings increases abruptly to over
71.3 nm. The results demonstrate that the surface roughness of the
films closely relates to the pH of their precursor colloids. The sur-
face morphology of the ZnO films or coatings can be tailored by
using optimum acid agents to adjust the precursor colloids at opti-
mum pH.
TEM analysis.— The crystal structure of the ZnO films and coat-
ings was further investigated by TEM analysis. Figure 7a displays
the TEM images and selected area electron diffraction SAED pat-
terns of the films prepared with HOOC colloidpH 2.5. It demon-
strates that the microstructure of the HCOOH colloidpH 2.5 film is
composed of small crystallites with a crystallite size of 20 nm,
and the SAED pattern confirms that the small crystallites of the film
is a polycrystal wurtzite structure.
In addition, for the TEM observation, the specimens of the HCl
colloid’s coating must be sufficiently thin. This was achieved by
removing the glass substrate and the fine crystallite bottom layer
near the substrate. Ion milling of the large crystallites to reach a
crystallite thickness below 100 nm to allow the TEM E-beam trans-
mission was also conducted. The TEM image and the SAED pattern
of the large crystallites of the coatings prepared with
HCl colloidpH 0.1 are given in Fig. 7b. It is evident that large crys-
tallites, as large as approximately 600 nm, are present. The appear-
ance of the SAED pattern taken from the areas pointed by the arrow
in the image as perfect regular spots indicates the high crystallinity
of the large crystallites, which confirms that the obtained ZnO large
crystallites have a single-crystal structure.
XPS analysis.— To further understand the pH effect of the pre-
cursor colloids on the chemical bonding of the ZnO crystallites, the
XPS analysis of the films prepared with raw colloidpH 5.9,
HCOOH colloidpH 2.5, and HCl colloidpH 0.1 was performed. Fig-
ure 8a shows the Zn 2p3/2 XPS spectrum of the raw colloidpH 5.9
film, and the XPS spectrum of the film can be deconvoluted into two
peaks, a higher binding energy peak at 1021.8 eV corresponding to
the perfect ZnO bonds and a lower binding energy peak ZnO at
1020.8 eV, indicating the presence of deficient ZnO states. It was
observed that the peak content of the perfect ZnO bonds of the
acidic films, as shown in Fig. 8b and c, is larger than that of the raw
(a) PH 5.9 RMS 13.7 nm (b) PH 2.5 RMS 6.8 nm
(c) PH 2.0 RMS 10.1 nm (d) PH 1.1 RMS 21.3 nm
(e) PH 0.5 RMS 72.7 nm

if the colloid’s pH remains in the pH values of between pH 2.0 and
1.0, the morphology of the films presents a mixed feature of nano-
crystallites and large single crystals.
