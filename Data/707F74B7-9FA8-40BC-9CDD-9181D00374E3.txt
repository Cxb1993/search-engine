Abstract
In this investigation, the ultrasonic
vibration and the assisted magnetic force are
integrated with the electrical discharge
machining (EDM) to form a hybrid process,
and then the combined process is adopted to
explore the effects of the main machining
parameters on the material removal rate (MRR),
electrode wear rate (EWR), surface roughness
(SR) and morphologies of machined surface for
machining SKD 61 mould steel. Moreover, the
effects correlated with expelling the debris
from the machining gap are also studied via
evaluating the discharge waveforms, and
analyzing the morphology of machined surface.
The bottleneck on machining large area using
EDM process would be overcome when the
optimal parameters of the hybrid process
combined EDM with assisted magnetic force
and ultrasonic vibration is obtained. From the
experimental results shown, the hybrid EDM
process of integrated the ultrasonic vibration
and the assisted magnetic force can improve the
machining characteristics of EDM. The MRR
was increased significantly and the SR was
reduced to ameliorate the surface quality. The
hybrid process revealed the potential for EDM
applications in large area machining.
Keywords: EDM, hybrid process, EDM,
magnetic assisted force, ultrasonic vibration,
large area machining.
二、緣由與目的
放電加工法乃是將工件與工具電極浸入
絕緣加工液中，並在兩極間導入適當的電場
強度，當工具電極逐漸向工件接近時，由於
電場強度隨極間距離縮短而逐漸增強，致使
極間產生絕緣破壞的現象，進而在工件與電
極間藉離子化而形成放電柱。放電加工對材
料的移除效果，乃是藉由放電柱，在兩極間
引發高溫、高熱現象，使材料產生蒸發、熔
融作用，透過加工過程中絕緣液因高熱氣化
在極間引發局部的爆壓衝擊力，促使熔融材
料從加工的表面移除。一般而言，放電加工
的性能並不受材料本身強度、硬度等機械性
3表面粗糙度、再鑄層厚度及表面裂紋，降低
對放電加工表面品質造成致命危害的可能
性。
由於放電加工過程中加工屑的排除對加
工效率及加工表面的品質特性具有決定性的
影響，本研究計畫擬在放電加工機上附加超
音波振動機構及磁力輔助機構整合成複合放
電加工機構，確立超音波振動及磁力輔助對
放電複合加工機制的有效的運作模式，並以
此複合放電加工機構進行加工實驗研究，探
討其對 SKD 61 模具鋼進行複合放電加工
時，超音波加工參數、磁力輔助加工參數及
放電加工主要參數，對材料去除率、電極消
耗率及表面粗糙度及加工表面狀態等放電加
工特性的影響。希望經由本計畫的執行能確
立超音波與磁力輔助複合放電機構的加工效
益，建立此一複合放電加工技術，提升放電
時極間的排渣效果，使放電時極間的狀態獲
得改善，以適應大面積放電加工時可能面臨
的挑戰，建立快速便捷且表面形態及尺寸精
度優良的複合放電加工技術，提升加工的技
術層次，厚植國家科學及產業的實力。
三、實驗方法
3.1 實驗材料
實驗材料選用 SKD 61 模具鋼為工件，
試片尺寸分別為 110×110×8 mm(波形觀察)及
55×55×8 mm(加工特性)，表面皆先精磨以確
保平行度， SKD 61 模具鋼之化學成分如表
一所示。電極則使用 50 mm 及 100 mm 正方
形，厚度為 8 mm 之電解銅，電極之放電加
工端面在實驗前需逐次先以 600#、800#、
1200#砂紙於平台上研磨，以確保電極加工表
面之表面粗糙度與平行度。表二則為銅電極
材料之基本性質。實驗使用之放電加工絕緣
液，為市售之放電加工專用油，並以自製之
油槽控制加工液之液面高度，以便順利進行
放電加工實驗。

3.2 實驗方法
本研究係採用電晶體控制回路之雕模放
電加工機附加自行研發之超音波振動與磁力
輔助機構，整合成超音波與磁力輔助複合放
電加工機構，探討此一複合加工機構對 SKD
61 模具鋼進行放電加工時，加工參數對材料
去除率、電極消耗率及表面粗糙度等放電加
工特性的影響。實驗中除使用自行設計之超
音波動頭附加於放電加工機主軸，磁力輔助
機構則與油槽及工件固定座結合，使用高強
度的永久磁鐵，搭配可調整速度之往覆運動
機構，置於工件夾持座下方，形成超音波與
磁力輔助複合放電加工系統。
超音波與磁力輔助複合放電加工特性的
量測包括材料去除率(Material removal rate,
MRR /mm3· min-1)、電極消耗率 (Electrode
wear rate, EWR / mm 3 ·min-1)及表面粗糙度
(Surface roughness, Ra/m)，加工前後均需量
測工件試片及電極的重量，以便計算材料去
除率及電極消耗率，試片重量的量測係採用
(Percisa XT 220A)精度 0.1mg 之精密電子秤
進行測量，表面粗糙度的量測係採用
(Mitutoyo-SJ401)精密表面輪廓粗度儀，採隨
機方式量測 5 次加工面的表面粗糙度值，並
且求其算數平均值做為表面粗糙度的評估基
準。實驗中利用高速數位式示波器偵測放電
波形的變化，藉以評估超音波與磁力輔助複
合放電加工實驗過程中極間的穩定性。同時
利用光學顯微鏡(OM)及掃描式電子顯微鏡
(SEM)對加工表面進行觀察，以瞭解放電加
工表面微觀狀態。圖一為超音波與磁力輔助
複合放電加工實驗設備圖。
3.3 實驗條件
液中氣體放電加工實驗研究主要探討參
5同時又有磁力輔助的排渣作用，可明顯提升
放電加工的性能，具有較佳的材料去除率同
時又可獲得較精細的加工表面，對大面積放
電加工具有應用的潛力。

般放電加工特性之比較
4.3 複合放電加工材料去除率分析
圖四為超音波與磁力輔助複合放電加工
在不同放電電流與脈衝作用時間的加工條件
下材料去除率的比較。由圖中實驗結果可
知，超音波與磁力輔助複合放電加工之材料
移除率會隨著放電峰值電流之增加而提高，
顯示超音波與磁力輔助複合放電加工隨著放
電能量的增加，在極間產生明顯的蒸發、熔
融等材料去除效果，使得材料的去除率會隨
著放電能量的增加而增加。同時隨著放電脈
衝時間的增加，材料去除率呈現先增加達到
一定峰值後，隨著脈衝時間進一步延長，都
有下降的趨勢。一般而言，放電點之放電柱
直徑會隨著放電脈衝時間的增加而膨脹，脈
衝作用初期較大的放電柱直徑對加工表面材
料熔融、蒸發等放電材料移除機制，具有正
向效果，因此材枓去除率可隨脈衝作用時間
的逐漸增加而增大；然而隨著放電脈衝時間
進一步的延長，將造成放電柱內的能量密度
隨放電柱的膨脹而降低，當其下降到一定值
時，將對材料的移除效產生不利的影響，因
此料去除率將產生下降的現象。圖五為加工
極性對超音波與磁力輔助複合放電加工之材
料去除率的影響。由實驗結果可看出，將銅
電極接到電源陽極而SKD 61工件材料接到
電源陰極的正極性加工(+)，可得到較高的材
料去除率。一般而言，在較長脈衝時間的加
工條件下，陰極將承受較多的放電能量[9]，
引發較明顯的蒸發、熔融等材料去除作用，
因此有較為明顯的材料去除效果。同時隨著
放電脈衝時間的增加，材料去除率在正及負
極性加工，均呈現先增加達到峰值後，隨著
脈衝時間進一步延長，都有下降的趨勢。

音波與磁力輔助複合放電加工之電極消耗率
會隨著放電峰值電流之增加而提高，同時，
電極消耗率會隨著放電脈衝作用時間的延長
而有下降的現象。一般而言，電極消耗率大
7有超音波震動，使極間放電產生的加工屑
不易聚集影響極間的穩定；同時又有磁力

性能，具有較佳的材料去除率同時又可獲
得較精細的加工表面，對大面積放電加工

同時，電極消耗率會隨著放電脈衝作用時

工時，電極消耗率非常低。
4.加工表面之粗糙度值隨著放電電流的增加
而增加，並且隨脈衝時間的增加，表面粗

KEYWORDS : EDM in gas, Material removal rate, Electrode wear rate, Surface roughness, Machining performance  
 
 
The aim of this study is to construct a diverse process of electrical discharge machining (EDM) in gas media, and 
then the new developed machining approach was used to investigate the effects of machining parameters on 
machining characteristics. Firstly, the feasibility of the EDM in gas media was established with consecutive electrical 
sparks generated within the machining gap. Moreover, the main machining parameters such as peak current, pulse 
duration, machining polarity, and gas media supply conditions like air compressed pressure were varied to evaluate 
the effects on machining characteristics of SKD 61 mold steel in the developed EDM process. The surface morphology 
of machined surface was observed by a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) to determine the influences of EDM 
discharge energy on surface integrities. From the result shown in experiments, the material removal rate (MRR) 
increased with peak current, pulse duration, and air pressure. In addition, the electrode wear rate (EWR) went up with 
peak current at first, and then attained a peak value with extending the pulse duration and the air pressure, but the 
EWR declined with further increasing of the pulse duration and the air pressure. Furthermore, the integrities of the 
machined surface revealed dramatically rough features when the peak current was set at high value. While the pulse 
duration was further extending, the surface integrities of the machined surface exhibited a smoothened trend obtained 
by EDM in gas media. Consequently, the developed technique of EDM in gas media possesses the potential of 
promoting machining performance, reducing environment impact, and extending the EDM applications.

1. Introduction  
 
Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is one of non-traditional 
machining processes, which are widely employed in mold and die 
manufacturing industries. Recently the EDM process is also used in 
micro electromechanical system (MEMS) to fabricate the micro and 
precise components with extremely complicated shape and tight 
tolerance [1-4]. The machining characteristics of EDM process are 
not subjected to mechanical properties such as material tensile 
strength, hardness, and toughness etc. Therefore, the EDM process is 
greatly suitable to shape difficult-to-machine materials such as mold 
steels, ceramics, and composites [5-6]. As a result, great efforts have 
been conducted to investigate the machining performance of EDM 
process for various advanced materials, which have exhibited the 
outstanding outcome in sophisticated industrial applications [7-10]. In 
the last decade, the research works executed for EDM process mainly 
focused on the issues of improving the machining efficiency, 
marching precision, quality of machined surface, and the machining 
stabilization during EDM [11-14]. 
Dielectric fluid like kerosene exhibited excellent machining 
performance, so it is widely employed in common EDM applications. 
Using kerosene as the dielectric fluid for EDM process would incur 
the undesirable problems in terms of fire hazard, air pollution, and 
environmental damage during EDM process. Therefore, to develop a 
reliable dielectric medium with both excellent EDM performance and 
environmentally friendly feature is urgently necessary and the 
automatic operation of EDM process in safety regime will be 
realized[15]. The concept of EDM performed in gas media was 
proposed by Kuneida and his coworkers in 1997 [16-17]. The molten 
materials generated during EDM process was ejected from machining 
area by an air jet with high pressure. In their work, the removal 
efficiency of molten material was improved by using a hollow 
electrode, which passed the high compressed air into machining gap

3.1 Effects of machining polarity 
Figure 3 shows the effects of machining polarity on MRR for 
EDM in gas media. As the SKD 61 specimen was connected to 
cathode and copper electrode was joined to anode (negative polarity), 
the EDM in gas media would obtain higher MRR. Moreover, the 
MRR for EDM in gas media went up with the pulse duration. In 
general, the cathode would receive more discharge energy at longer 
pulse duration. As a result, the material removal mechanisms caused 
by EDM process such as melting, vaporizing, and impulsive force 
become more distinguished on the cathode at longer pulse duration 
[25]. Therefore, the MRR of EDM in gas media was higher as the 
workpiece connected to cathode at longer pulse duration. In addition, 
the discharge energy delivered to machining gap increased with pulse 
duration within a single pulse, so the surplus material was removed 
more apparently. However, the energy density within discharge spot 
would reduce at end interval of single pulse, since the diameter of 
discharge column would expand. The impulsive force also decreased 
at end interval of single pulse by using conventional dielectric fluids. 
Consequently, the molten workpiece materials were not removed 
completely from machined surface, since the impulse force caused by 
exploding dielectric fluid was deficient and the energy density within 
discharge spot was insufficient. Thus, the recast layer would form on 
the machined surface after EDM process due to the molten materials 
re-solidification. The evacuation of molten material mainly based on 
the spurting action resulted from high pressure air when gas media 
was employed in EDM process as the dielectric. It is worthy to note 
that the effects of pulse duration on MRR for EDM process 
demonstrated obvious variations between gas media and conventional 
dielectric fluid. The MRR increased with pulse duration for gas media. 
On the contrary, the MRR using conventional dielectric fluid would 
increase with pulse duration firstly and subsequently attained a peak 
value when the pulse duration set at a suitable length. Then the MRR 
would decline as the pulse duration extended to an exceeding interval 
[6]. Figure 4 depicts the relationships between machining polarity and 
EWR. As the experimental results show that the workpiece connected 
to cathode (negative polarity) obtained a higher EWR compared with 
anode (positive polarity). Furthermore, the EWR slowly decreased 
with an increase in pulse duration. In contrast, the EWR exhibited 
very small and the variation of EWR is also slight in the rage of pulse 
durations, while the workpiece connected to anode (positive polarity). 
There were even minus values of EWR when positive machining 
polarity was employed in the EDM in gas media. The minus value of 
EWR means that the electrode weight was added after EDM process. 
This is attributed to the fact that the workpiece material would be 
transferred and deposited on the electrode surface during EDM 
process. Indeed, it will introduce the uncertainty of dimensional 
accuracy. Consequently, for reducing the uncertainty of dimensional 
accuracy, the experimental works were conducted at negative 
machining polarity in the following experimental design scheme.

coarser when the peak current and pulse duration increased, since the 
wider and deeper craters were formed on the machined surface. 
However, if the pulse duration extended to an exceeding interval 
(longer than 750 μs in this investigation), the density of discharge 
energy within spark spot would reduce gradually when the diameter 
of discharge column expanded obviously. As a result, the discharge 
craters would become wider but shallower on the machined surface. 
The energy density within spark spot become insufficient at 
exceeding long pulse duration, so the workpiece material within spark 
spot could be molten but could not be removed completely. Therefore, 
the depth of discharge crater became shallower at such a long pulse 
duration, and the surface roughness of the machined surface obtained 
from exceeding long pulse duration was smaller than that from short 
pulse duration.      
   Figure 9 shows the micrographs of machined surface obtained 
from SEM performed by EDM in gas media with various machining 
conditions. From the observation on the machined surface with large 
magnification, the machined surface became coarser when the peak 
current and pulse duration increased to promote the material removal 
effects during the EDM process. Nevertheless, when the pulse 
duration was further extended, the surface integrities would not 
deteriorate. In contrast, the discharge craters revealed on the 
machined surface became more even and shallow, and the surface 
integrities demonstrated fine features associated with the EDM in gas 
media at long pulse duration condition.

4. Conclusions  
 
This investigation explored the EDM characteristics of SKD 61 
steel by using gas media as dielectric. From the analysis based on 
experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn. 
(1)The use of negative machining polarity (SKD 61 steel connected 
to cathode and copper tool linked to anode) could obtain higher 
MRR for EDM in gas media. Moreover, if the pulse duration 
extended, the MRR depicted an increasing trend. The EWR 
obtained from negative machining polarity was higher than that 
obtained from positive machining polarity, and the EWR declined 
slightly with an increase of pulse duration. 
(2)The MRR for EDM in gas media increased with air pressure, and 
the MRR attained a peak vale at 5 kg/cm2. Moreover, the MRR 
enlarged with both peak current and pulse duration. However, 
when the pulse duration was beyond a critical value, the MRR 
could not further increase with the pulse duration. 
(3)The EWR for EDM in gas media magnified with peak current and 
exhibited a slightly reduction with extending the pulse duration. 
(4)The surface roughness for EDM in gas media increased with peak 
current and pulse duration under various peak currents and pulse 
durations. In addition, the surface roughness reached a peak value 
at the pulse duration near 750 μs. If the pulse duration was further 
lengthened, the surface roughness revealed the trend of gradually 
degradation. 
(5)The surface integrities obtained from SEM micrographs displayed 
coarsened when the peak current increased. Despite the pulse 
duration was prolonged to a specific level, the surface integrities 
did not further deteriorate. As a result, the surface morphologies 
reveal a finish effeteness and discharge craters presented on the 
machined surface with a flatten trend at long pulse duration.

1. Introduction
Among the several advantages of magnetic abrasive finishing
(MAF) include its self-sharpening, self-adaptability and self-
controllability capabilities, enabling it to remove deteriorated layers
and micro cracks from a workpiece and easily obtain a mirror-like
surface [1-5]. Kim et al. [1] utilized two magnetic abrasive tools, i.e.
magnetic abrasive wheel and magnetic brush, to polish a free-form
surface, demonstrating that two-stage polishing method can finish the
free-form surface efficiently and without any complex tool-path
control. Chang et al. [2] used an unbonded magnetic abrasive (UMA)
to polish the cylindrical rod of steel, subsequently decreasing surface
roughness from 0.25 mRa to 0.06 mRa within a few minutes.
Additionally, they also applied UMA to grind the EDM surface of the
cylindrical rod, demonstrating the feasibility of easily removing the
recasting layers and cracks [3]. Yin et al. [4] developed a vertical
vibration assisted MAF, in which the micro burr of the magnesium
alloy could be withdrawn in a short time and the material removal
rate of this alloy exceeded that of the brass and the stainless steel.
Finishing properties of MAF were closely related to the magnetic
abrasive used. Magnetic abrasives of MAF can be divided into two
parts. The first is UMA [2, 3, 6-7], in which this magnetic abrasive is
applied to the stirring method in order to mix the ferromagnetic
particles and the abrasives. Therefore, the abrasive is not physically
bonded to the ferromagnetic material. The other magnetic abrasive
utilizes the ferromagnetic matrix to hold the abrasive and forms as
abrasive medium by sintering, chemical or other procedures [1, 4-5,
8-9]; these abrasives are commonly referred to as bounded magnetic
abrasives (BMA). Nevertheless, UMA is not bonded to the
ferromagnetic material; these abrasives are easily flown away by the
centrifugal force in MAF. Therefore, the finishing effect is unstable
when UMA is used as the abrasive medium in MAF. Despite having
an excellent bonding force to the abrasives, BMA requires a long time
to produce, subsequently increasing costs in MFA. Regardless UMA
or BMA, these abrasives can not recycle after finishing. By applying
polymer gel to bond the ferromagnetic particles and abrasive can
alleviate the above mentioned abrasive media problems [10]. This
study attempts to find how the gel properties affect the polishing
efficiency.

2.1 MFGA set up
Figure 1 shows the MFGA layout. Equipment consists of a
magnetic force control system, rotating system, reciprocating system
and control panel. A magnetic force control system uses two series of
electromagnets to induce the magnetic poles that produce the
magnetic field during finishing. A rotating system utilizes a brushless
DC motor (M1) to drive the chuck that enables the workpiece to
achieve rotational motion. Eccentric cam, induction motor (M2) and
frequency converter were combined as the reciprocating system to
produce the axial vibration of the workpiece. A control panel was
applied to adjust the current and the vibrating frequency in MFGA.

2.2 Materials
Polymer gel was the most important material used in this study to
mix the ferromagnetic particles and the abrasives. Silicone gels, semi-
solid polymers, have a deformable characteristic, and do not attach
itself on the workpiece after contact, making it an excellent material
to form the base of the gel abrasive [10]. These gels with various

KEYWORDS : Magnetic abrasive finishing, Gel abrasive, Self-sharpening
Magnetic finishing with gel abrasive (MFGA) performs better than magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) in terms of
polishing efficiency. However, silicone gels are semi-solid polymer gels with deforming properties that are
temperature dependent materials, ultimately degrading the polishing efficiency in MFGA significantly. Therefore,
this study evaluated the MFGA mechanism to elucidate the properties of silicone gels in order to attain both the
finished effect in MFGA and effective gel abrasives to produce a highly efficient polished surface. Cylindrical rods
were polished using silicone gels with different plasticity to determine the temperature of abrasive media in the
working area. Next, circulating effects of abrasive media were identified to ensure the efficiency in MFGA.
Additionally, finding the relation between the concentrations of abrasive media and circulating effect in the working
area. Experimental results showed that silicone gels with low plasticity produced high temperature of abrasive media
in MFGA, and high temperature of abrasive medium made excellent circulating effect in the working area, inducing
high material removal and fine surface roughness.

3.2 Silicone gels with various plasticity
Given the high plasticity of silicone gels had high hardness,
inducing poor deformation under stress; therefore, polished effects of
silicone gels with different plasticity were investigated here. This
experiment continuously finished the workpiece 30 minutes to find
temperature and surface roughness after MFGA. Fig. 6 displays the
effects of silicone gels with different plasticity on temperature of
abrasive media near machining surface. According to those results,
temperature of abrasive media raised with increasing the finishing
time in MFGA, temperature of silicone gel with plasticity 80, 120,
160 could reach to 111oC, 101oC, and 74oC. The reason was that
silicone gels with low plasticity had good ability to circulate in the
working area, so new abrasives would easily appear to abrade the
surface; these new cutting edges produce high machining temperature
in MFGA. Since temperature of silicone gels with plasticity 80 and
120 could exceed 100oC after finishing 30 minutes, those two gels
could handily circulate in the working area; therefore, excellent
efficiency could be obtained by these gels. For example, using
silicone gels with plasticity 80 or 120 as abrasive medium, surface
roughness of workpiece could be decreased from 0.655μm Ra to
0.025 or 0.021μm Ra; moreover, 0.234 and 0.193 g material removal
(MR) could also be located in these experiments. However, utilizing
silicone gel with plasticity 160 as abrasive medium, surface
roughness of workpiece could be lessened to 0.058μm Ra only and
material removal was only 0.105 g after polishing. Hence,
temperature in the working area would dominate the polishing
efficiency in MFGA. Fig. 7 demonstrates change of the silicone gels
with different plasticity after finishing 30 minutes. Given to high
temperature of silicone gels with plasticity 80 or 120 after finishing
30 minutes, Fig. 7(b) and 7(d) exhibited noteworthy circulations of
abrasive media. Nevertheless, silicone gel with plasticity 160 had
high hardness, causing low circulating effect in MFGA. Consequently,
only little circulation was found in the machining area, explaining
why silicone gel with high plasticity could not produce excellent
polishing efficiency.

3.3 Polishing efficiency of different concentrations
Since circulation of abrasive media in the working area had
remarkable effect in the polishing efficiency, yet either plasticity or
concentration of the abrasive media could affect the circulating
phenomenon in MFGA. Hence, excepting the plasticity of silicone
gel, we should identify the relationship between concentrations and
circulation of abrasive media in the working area. Abrasive medium
in this study contained silicone gels, ferromagnetic particles (SG)
and SiC abrasive, weight of each material was used to decide the
concentration of the abrasive medium. However, weight of silicone
gels 10 g and SG 15 g were not change, only weight of SiC was
utilized as parameter in the following research. Workpieces were
also finished 30 minutes in these experiments, but surface
roughness and material removal should be located at each 5 minutes
to verify the efficiency with different concentrations.

4. Conclusions
New magnetic abrasive medium, using silicone gels with
different plasticity to mix steel grits and silicon carbon, were
developed to enhance the efficiency of MAF in this study. Since
silicone gels are semi-solid polymers that have good deformable
ability and these gels don’t stick on the workpiece after contact, so
gel abrasives were easily produced and it was easily cleared away
from the workpiece after MFGA. Silicone gels are temperature
dependent materials, temperature of abrasive medium reached to
110oC in the working area with using silicone gels as bonding gels;
these gels produced a fluid property in a high temperature
environment. Abrasive media created a fine circulation in MFGA if
silicone gels slowly flow in the working area; then abrasives were
easily replaced by the circulating effect in the finishing process.
This phenomenon could not happen in MAF; therefore, MFGA
functioned better than MAF in the polishing efficiency.
Silicone gels with high plasticity are harder than the silicone
gels with low plasticity, temperature of high plasticity gels are
smaller than the temperature of low plasticity gels. In our
experiments, temperatures of silicone gels with plasticity 80 and
120 both exceed 100oC in the working area within 30 minutes, but
temperature of silicone gels with plasticity 160 only raised to 74oC
within the same time, explaining why silicone gels with plasticity
80 and 120 induced excellent circulating effect in MFGA. Hence,
silicone gels with plasticity 80 and 120 performed better than
silicone gel with plasticity 160 during polishing 30 minutes in terms
of efficiency. However, concentrations of abrasive in the abrasive
media affected the circulating effect in MFGA; in general, abrasive
media contained less abrasive made excellent circulation in the
working area. For example, abrasive medium contained 5g SiC
operated better than the medium contained 10 and 15g SiC in terms
of surface roughness when silicone gel with plasticity 80 and 120
was utilized as bases in MFGA. Nevertheless, abrasive medium
contained 10g SiC produce more MR than abrasive medium with 5
and 15g did if the same gels were applied as media. Additionally,
abrasive medium contained 5g SiC performed better than abrasive
medium contained 10g SiC in both surface roughness and MR when
silicone gel with plasticity 160 was used as bonding gel. But
silicone gel with plasticity 160 was too hard to mix much abrasive,
so this gel could not mix 15g SiC as abrasive medium.
