Abstract  
The properties of a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) biosensor fabricated by immobilizing 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the thin film of electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) on a 
platinum electrode have been investigated. The possible electrochemical processes occurred on the 
electrode is discussed. Parameters that affect on the performances of this HRP/PANI/Pt biosensor 
are characterized. In particular, the influence of the dissolved oxygen in the test and sample solution 
on the measurement of H2O2 is extensively investigated.  This problem can be overcome by 
utilizing mild reducing agent, such as sodium thiosulfate. The modified biosensor exhibits a 
satisfied linear correlation between the cyclic voltammetric response and the concentration of H2O2 
in a wide range from 0.01 to 35.2 mM with a sensitivity of 37.55 µA/mM and a correlation 
coefficient of 0.997. In addition, we have attempted to apply this amperometric HRP/PANI/Pt 
biosensor to measure the H2O2 in human urine as well as cell culture mediums; however, the 
interferences from other ingredients are inevitable. Therefore, to eliminate these influences from an 
actual sample will be the major challenge in future for the development of practical biosensor for 
H2O2 detection in a biological system. 
 
Keywords: HRP, biosensor, H2O2
1. Introduction 
 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a small, diffusible, unstable, and ubiquitous signaling molecule 
that functions as an important mediator for various intracellular events in response to different 
stimuli [Rhee, 1999; Neill, et al., 2002]. The concentrations of H2O2 in different intracellular 
compartments are expected to maintain at a minimal level by effective antioxidant mechanisms, but 
are normally elevated under abnormal conditions or cellular metabolisms [Fiander and Schneider, 
2000; Wagner, et al., 2005]. The excess H2O2 is often recognized as one of the major reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) that may cause DNA damage and cell death [Rhee, 1999; Gu, et al., 2001]. 
The concentrations of H2O2 are detectable in human plasma and urine under abnormal physiological 
conditions [Halliwell, et al., 2000] and have been implicated in several diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases [Tabner, et al., 2002; Milton, 2004]; therefore, H2O2 is to be a 
potential biomarker in clinical diagnosis. However, the actual concentrations of H2O2 in vivo are 
often controversial [Bleau, et al., 1998; Nohl, et al., 2005], which is largely due to the limitation of 
methods employed and the inherent instability of H2O2. Obviously, it is necessary to develop 
 3

auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3M NaCl) electrode as the reference electrode. 
 
2.3. Preparation of PANI/Pt electrode   
To construct a Pt/ceramic base, platinum was sputtered on the ceramic plate with a shadow 
mask to form a desired pattern and dried at 50oC for one hour. A certain amount of aniline was then 
electropolymerized onto the Pt/ceramic base by immersing the working electrode into the solution 
containing 1 M HCl and 0.1 M aniline, whilst the potential was swept from 0.0 to 1.0 V for certain 
cycles under an ambient condition. The fashioned PANI/Pt electrode was then immersed in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 4.0) and reduced at -0.5 V for 20 min to remove the remaining 
chloride ions that were possibly embedded in the polymer matrix. It was then oxidized in the same 
PBS buffer at 0.6 V for 10 min. 
 
2.4. Enzyme immobilization   
HRP was immobilized according to the adsorption method described by Yang and Mu [Yang 
and Mu, 1997] with minor modifications. 1.7 mg of HRP (approximately 306 units) was suspended 
in 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH 5.6) where HRP was positively charged because it had an isoelectric point 
(pI) of 7.2. The pretreated PANI/Pt electrode was then transferred into the HRP solution and 
reduced at -0.5 V for 20 min to immobilize HRP on the PANI/Pt electrode. The HRP/PANI/Pt 
electrode was further stabilized by glutaradehyde solution and incubated at 4oC for overnight to 
form the covalent linkage between HRP and PANI. Afterward, the HRP/PANI/Pt electrode was 
rinsed with PBS buffer (pH 5.6) thoroughly and stored in 4oC refrigerator. 
 
2.5. Electrochemical measurements   
The catalytic mechanism of immobilized HRP to the reduction of H2O2 has already been 
proposed [Csoregi, et al., 1993]. The reduction of H2O2 at PANI/Pt or HRP/PANI/Pt electrode was 
quantified with a cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH 6.2). The buffer had undergone 
deoxygenation with highly pure nitrogen for 20 min before a certain amount of H2O2 was added. 
During the calibration of the concentration of H2O2, pure nitrogen gas was gentle purged on the 
surface of the sample solution to create an anaerobic atmosphere. 
 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Characterization of PANI modified electrode 
Figure 1A demonstrates that platinum is able to catalyze the electrochemical redox reactions of 
H2O2 within a selected potential range from -0.6 to 0.6 V, the addition of H2O2 gives rise to a major 
anodic response at 0.6 V and a cathodic response at 0.1 V on the bare platinum electrode, which is 
resulted from the oxidation of H2O2 to produce O2 and the further reduction of O2 vs. Ag/AgCl in 
0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer solution, respectively. Both anodic and cathodic responses at 0.6 and 
0.1 V, respectively, are strongly dependent on the concentration of H2O2. By narrowing the potential 
window between -0.6 and 0.4 V, the above redox responses at 0.1 and 0.6 V are almost completely 
V and its amine moieties (-NH-) are dominate, whereas a positive potential at 0.6 V leads to the 
dramatically increasing of imine moieties (=N- ) in PANI. At the reductive state, PANI possesses 
more secondary amines that can form hydrogen bond with –OH and –NH groups of HRP. 
Furthermore, the secondary amines are able to participating crosslinking with HRP by 
glutaraldehyde. Consequently, the cumulative effect of nature adsorption, electrostatic and 
hydrophobic interactions drive the adsorption of HRP to the PANI, and hydrogen bonding stabilizes 
the immobilization of HRP to the PANI film. 
 
3.3 The effect of dissolved oxygen on sensing H2O2  
It has been commonly known that platinum has the electrocatalytic activity toward O2 
reduction, so does the PNAI covered platinum electrode. As depicted in Figure 4, a significant 
cathodic peak centering at -0.3 V is observed in corresponding to 2.39 mM H2O2 in 0.1 M PBS 
solution (pH 6.2) without deoxygenatoin procedure (Figure 4, Line (c)). Sparging the solution with 
pure nitrogen gas for ten minutes before the addition of H2O2 decreases the maximum cathodic 
response by about 1.82 times, in contrast, sparging with pure oxygen increases the maximum 
cathodic response by about 1.80 times (Figure 4, Lines (a) and (b), respectively). Therefore, the 
dissolved oxygen may overestimate the bulk concentration of H2O2 by PANI/Pt or HRP/PANI/Pt 
electrodes. In particular, the observed peak potential for O2 reduction is almost identical to that of 
H2O2 under the experimental condition, denoting that dissolved oxygen may go through the similar 
electrocatalytic course as that of H2O2, where oxygen may be quickly reduced to H2O2 at PANI/Pt 
electrode within the applied potential window, the reaction observed was plausibly ascribed to 
 7
222  OH 2  2H  O ⎯⎯ →⎯++ + PANIe        (6) 
and then H2O2 was reduced to water through reaction (1).   
Although sparging with nitrogen is an effective way to remove the dissolved oxygen, it 
impractical for real samples due to the high volatility of H2O2. To circumvent this problem, we have 
tried to use oxygen scavengers, such as sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and ascorbic acid (C6H8O6). 
As shown in Figure 5, both sodium thiosulfate and ascorbic acid can diminish the cathodic peak as a 
result of the dissolved oxygen, whereas sodium thiosulfate is more effective.  
 Even though sodium thiosulfate is normally known as a mild reducing agent that may directly 
reduce the hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution, the reaction rate is somewhat slower than that 
catalyzed by PANI or HRP on the electrode. Therefore, with the presence of hydrogen peroxide, 
sodium thiosulfate may act as an efficient oxygen scavenge, on the other hand, it brings about much 
less effects on the cathodic response to hydrogen peroxide (Figure 6). 
 
3.4 The effect of entrapped protein on the sensitivity 
Previously, we have demonstrated that the entrapping BSA as a mediator into the aniline 
solution during electropolymerization improves the sensitivity of the biosensor. Further 
investigation demonstrates that the entrapped BSA can significantly stabilize the PANI as shown in 
Figure 7. Meanwhile, the results of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform
