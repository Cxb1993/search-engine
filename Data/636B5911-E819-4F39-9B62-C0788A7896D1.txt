Digital programmable light spectrum synthesis system
using a digital micromirror device
C. H. Chuang and Y. L. Lo
We present a digital programmable light spectrum synthesis system based on a digital micromirror
device (DMD) from Texas Instruments. A DMD pattern-scanning calibration method is developed and
applied to the synthesis of various infrared C-band (1530–1565 nm) spectral profiles, including a fast
programmable tunable light source with a bandwidth of approximately 3.8 nm, a square profile, a
sawtooth waveform, and a triangular spectrum profile. The experimental results show that the wave-
length resolution of the DMD spectrum synthesis system is approximately 0.076 nmpixel. The proposed
spectrum synthesis system has a number of key advantages, including a rapid and stable performance
and multichannel compatibility. The spectrum synthesis system is suitable for various applications,
including pulse shaping for coherent control and harmonic generation, a tunable light source, an equal-
izer for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, and a wavelength scanner. © 2006 Optical Society of America

1. Introduction
Digital micromirror device (DMD) chips are most
commonly applied in commercial digital light pro-
cessing (DLP) projector engines. However, various
other applications have also been proposed,1–3 includ-
ing near-infrared spectrometry, and programmable
array microscopy. The Riza group has proposed many
potential applications of DMD chips in optical fiber
communications. For example, in an early study, they
developed a high-density multiwavelength add–drop
filter using a two-dimensional DMD chip.4 The pro-
posed filter featured a polarization-insensitive oper-
ation, low interchannel cross-talk parallel processing,
and a fault-tolerant design. In later studies, Riza and
Sumriddetchkajorn5,6 simplified their original sys-
tem and applied the macropixel concept to develop
an optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
attenuator. Walter et al.7 presented a dynamic opti-
cal filter for dense wavelength division multiplex-
ing (DWDM) systems. The authors reported that the
DMD functions as a two-dimensional switched blazed
grating (SBG) when modulating coherent light
beams. In 2002, Sumriddetchkajorn and Riza8 and
Sumriddetchkajorn9 designed a digitally controlled
optical beam profiler, thereby making possible the
realization of a number of different beam profile mea-
surement concepts. A year later, Riza and Mughal10
combined the DMD macropixel concept with a high
spectral resolution broadband transmissive volume
Bragg grating to design a broadband optical equal-
izer. In the proposed system, a light beam was sepa-
rated by the grating into its constituent wavelengths
and the number of pixels in the wavelength mac-
ropixels was selected in order to control the spectral
intensity. The system design hypothesized the light
beam to have a Gaussian distribution when deriving
the optical system parameters used to obtain the
wavelength and intensity information from the DMD
chip. However, this assumption is not realistic in
practice and therefore creates difficulties in obtaining
a precise spectrum profile shape.
This study extends the concept presented by Riza
and Mughal in Ref. 10 and uses ZEMAX software to
design a transmissive-type light spectrum synthesis
system. Uniquely, this study develops a DMD pattern
scanning calibration method, which eliminates the
requirement for a Gaussian spectral distribution and
a precise alignment of the DMD chip. In the proposed
approach, the DMD spectral distribution contour is
obtained simply by scanning the DMD along the X
and Y axes, respectively, where the X axis corre-

this particular pixel is collected by the fiber lens as
illustrated in Fig. 1. Therefore a synthesized spec-
trum can be obtained by adjusting the pattern of the
DMD chip where the diffraction light is incident.
B. Digital Micromirror Device Chip Scanning Calibration
If all of the micromirrors on the DMD chip are set to
12°, all of the1-order diffracted light on the DMD
chip is reflected into the fiber lens. To calibrate the
relationship between the diffraction wavelength and
the X-axis coordinates of the DMD chip, a string-line
pattern is scanned along the X-axis direction. Simi-
larly, the diffraction intensity is calibrated by scan-
ning a string-line pattern along the Y-axis direction.
Figure 3 illustrates both string-line pattern scans
along the X and Y axes in the DMD chip. The spec-
trum corresponding to an individual DMD pixel is
expressed as
Fs, iDxm, yn, (6)
where Fs, i is the calibrated light spectrum, s is the
spectrum, i is the intensity, andDxm, yn are the DMD
pixel coordinates. If the spectrum on the DMD chip
has a Gaussian10 or uniform distribution, the inten-
sity distribution along the Y axis is easily obtained.
However, these conditions do not always hold. There-
fore string-line pixel scans are performed along
the X and Y axes, respectively, to obtain the two-
dimensional spectrum distribution on the DMD chip.
From Eq. (6), the light spectrum synthesis principle
is given by
Ss, iDxm, yn	xm, yn, (7)
where Ss, i is the synthesized light spectrum and
	xm, yn is the ON–OFF state of the DMD pixels.
When the micromirror state is 12° (i.e., the ON
state), 	xm, yn  1; otherwise 	xm, yn  0.
3. ZEMAX Simulation of the Light Spectrum
Synthesis System
Figure 4 presents a schematic of the light spectrum
synthesis system simulated using the ZEMAX optical
design software. Since in ZEMAX, the light source
cannot be specified as a continuous spectrum, this
study specified a light source with an infrared C-band
Gaussian spectrum distribution with three different
wavelengths, i.e., min  1530 nm, cen  1550 nm,
and max  1565 nm. The simulations assumed
the following: (i) a collimated light beam waist of
w  1 mm, (ii) a telecommunication grating with a
grating period of 1.667 
m, (iii) a light diffracted or-
der of 1, and (iv) an incident angle of i  45°.
Therefore from Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively, it was
found that the 1-order diffracted angle was cen 
12.879° and the spread angle was   1.235°. The
distance between the grating and the DMD chip, D,
was set at 250 mm. As shown in Fig. 4, lenses L1, L2,
and L3 focused the 12° state diffracted light from
the DMD into the fiber lens. The system parameters
analyzed by the ZEMAX simulations were then used
to establish an experimental setup for a digital pro-
grammable light spectrum synthesis system.
Figure 5 presents an enlarged view of the DMD
chip shown in Fig. 4. As shown, the chip is tilted at an
angle of 57° about the light axis. As discussed previ-
ously, the micromirrors on the DMD chip have 12°
states. In the present simulations, the micromirrors
at either end of the DMD chip were set to 12°
(i.e., the OFF state), causing the incident light to
be reflected through an angle of 90°. Meanwhile, the
micromirrors in the central region of the DMD were
set to the 12° state (i.e., the ON state), causing the
incident light to be reflected at an angle of 42°. From
Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively, the X-axis spread
length was found to be Lx 6.425 mm and the Y-axis
spread length to be w  1 mm.
4. Experimental Setup and Calibration
A. Experimental Setup
The light source in the present experiments was
an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from an

many micromirror columns are included, the resolu-
tion will be poor. Figure 9 illustrates the relationship
between the diffracted light wavelength and the
DMD X-axis pixel coordinates as obtained by X-axis
string-line pattern scanning. From Eq. (5), the DMD
chip wavelength resolution R is found to be 0.076
nmpixel.
Since the spread of the light diffracted in the Y-axis
direction is narrow [from Eq. (4), Lyw 1 mm], the
scan period must be shorter than that used for the
X-axis scanning to enhance the intensity resolution.
A 10-pixel 136.8 
m string-line pattern was found
to induce a serious diffraction effect, and hence scan-
ning was performed using a string-line pattern with
an average value of 30 pixels. For example, the in-
tensity in row 45 represents the average recorded
intensity over rows 31 to 60 (i.e., 30 pixels in total).
Although the measured values of intensity therefore
indicate the relative intensity rather than the abso-
lute intensity, the results nevertheless provide a good
indication of the actual intensity. The relationships
between the DMD micromirror coordinates and the
wavelength and intensity, respectively, were used to
draw the contour of Fs, i  Dxm, yn as illustrated
in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the contour has
two peaks, i.e., at 1545 and 1534 nm, respectively,
as expected from Fig. 8. Furthermore, the results
of Lx  450 pixels  13.68 
m  6.156 mm and
Ly  90 pixels  13.68 
m  1.23 mm are consistent
with the results presented in Section 3. The area
shown in Fig. 10 contains 40,500 pixels, i.e., just 120
of the total number of pixels on the DMD chip. Hence
the potential exists to design a multichannel system.
Finally, the contour can be used to synthesize differ-
ent spectra by applying Eq. (7). Four light spectrum
synthesis examples are presented for illustration
purposes in the following section.
5. Illustrative Examples of Synthesized Spectra
and Discussion
Figure 11(a) shows a square spectrum profile synthe-
sized by the calibration pattern presented in Fig. 10.
It can be seen that the spectrum is poorly defined
because the 30-pixel string-line scanning pattern is
not sufficiently precise. However, the DMD pattern
can be simply and quickly tuned according to the
contour shown in Fig. 10. The wavelength and inten-
sity of the synthesis spectrum in Fig. 11(a) need to
be checked and then the numbers of the DMD OFF-

the micromirror coordinates. The technique proposed
in this study is fully digitally programmable and pro-
vides a simple and versatile means of synthesizing
various light patterns. Hence it is suitable for applica-
tion in optical communication systems, sensing sys-
tems, and fluorescence microscopy.
