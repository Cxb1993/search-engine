Ag NPs have been discovered [8]. 
A number of synthetic methods for controlling the morphologies of Ag 
NPs have been devised using strategies based on the use of agents such as 
surfactants and polymers [9,10].  For sensing applications, such as SERS, that 
require the adsorption of analytes onto metallic NP surfaces, the presence of 
unwanted surface residues remaining from the synthetic conditions may interfere 
significantly with the analysis [11].  In addition, such surface-bound residues 
increase the difficulty of performing chemistry on the surface.  The removal of the 
template or directing agent from the NPs’ surfaces may require harsh conditions or 
multiple washings.  Therefore, it remains a challenge to prepare metallic 
nanostructures possessing “clean” surfaces in water in the absence of a surfactant 
or polymer [12]. 
Recently, the use of γ-irradiation in the preparation of metal NPs has been 
demonstrated to have a number of highly advantageous properties: (1) the 
controlled reduction of metal ions can be performed without using an excess of a 
reducing agent or producing any undesired oxidation products from the reductant, 
(2) the rates of reactions initiated by radiation is well defined, and (3) the reducing 
agent is generated uniformly in the solution [13]. 
 
2. Motivation 
Previous γ-irradiation-mediated syntheses of Ag NPs have involved the 
simultaneous reduction of Ag+ ions and intermediate clusters until the final NPs 
evolved [14,15].  These studies did not, however, indicate clearly how the 
γ-irradiation dose influences the properties (e.g., particle diameters) of the 
fabricated NP products.  In this present study, we investigated the preparation of 
Ag NPs in aqueous solution using different γ-irradiation doses.  The goal of this 
research was to prepare Ag NPs with controllable diameters and having the 
“cleanest” surfaces possible through γ-irradiation-mediated syntheses in water (i.e., 
in the absence of surfactants or polymers).  Additionally, we wished to assess the 
 6
NPs relative to those of the products obtained at a dose of 360 Gy.  This finding 
reveals that the fabrication of the Ag NPs was complete after a γ-irradiation dose of 
ca. 360 Gy.  Taken together, these experimental results suggest that Ag NPs 
having “clean” surfaces (i.e., not contaminated with surfactant or polymer) were 
successfully prepared in water through this γ-irradiation approach.  In addition, it 
is possible to control the quantity and dimensions of the Ag NPs by varying the 
γ-irradiation dose applied to the AgNO3 solution. 
To verify that the γ-irradiation-mediated reduction of AgNO3 produces 
particles of various diameters, we removed small portions of NP products that had 
been treated with different doses of γ-irradiation from the reaction vessel and 
viewed them using SEM.  Figures 2a and 2b present SEM images of the Ag NPs 
obtained at γ-irradiation doses of 60 and 100 Gy, respectively.  After γ-irradiation 
at ca. 60 Gy, the mean values of the particle diameter and the standard deviation of 
the Ag NPs were 34.2 and 6.0 nm, respectively.  Increasing the γ-irradiation dose 
to 100 Gy led to Ag NPs having relatively smaller particle diameters: the mean 
values of the particle diameter and the standard deviation were 21.0 and 2.4 nm, 
respectively.  Figure 2c displays the effects of the various γ-irradiation doses on 
the particle diameters of the Ag NPs; the results are consistent with those observed 
from the UV–Vis absorption spectra, and confirm that the dimensions of the Ag 
NPs are controllable by varying the γ-irradiation dose applied to the AgNO3 
solutions.  At lower γ-irradiation doses (ca. 60–80 Gy), the mean diameters and 
size distributions were relatively larger than those obtained at an intermediate range 
of the γ-irradiation doses (ca. 100 Gy).  At higher γ-irradiation doses (200–533 
Gy), we observed smaller mean particle diameters for the Ag NPs, but with larger 
size distributions. 
Figure 2c indicates that reshaping of the Ag NPs probably occurred 
during the γ-irradiation process.  It has been suggested that photoinduced electron 
emission occurs for Ag NPs that are resonantly excited by illuminating light [19], 
implying that a transformation from metallic Ag to Ag+ ions occurs on the NP

2. Title: Using Capillary Electrophoresis to Rapidly Measure 
the Stability of Au/Ag Core/Shell Nanoparticles 
 
Abstract 
This paper describes how capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be employed 
to investigate the stability of Au/Ag core/shell nanoparticles (NPs).  We obtained a 
linear relationship (R2 > 0.99) between the electrophoretic mobilities and sizes of 
Au/Ag core/shell NPs whose diameters fell in the range from 21.4 to 60.1 nm; the 
relative standard deviations of these electrophoretic mobilities were all below 1.1%.  
We employed these separation conditions to investigate the size stability of such 
Au/Ag core/shell NPs samples.  Our results suggest that CE analyses will be 
useful for accelerating the rates of fabrication and characterization of future 
nanomaterials. 
 
Keywords: Capillary electrophoresis, stability, Au/Ag, core/shell, nanoparticles 
 
1. Background 
NPs are currently attracting a great deal of attention in a wide variety of 
scientific fields [1].  The design, synthesis, and characterization of nanostructures 
have become very important aspects of the emerging field of the nanomaterials 
because the manipulation of structures has a direct effect in their macroscopic 
properties.  In fact, the physical and chemical properties of NPs are directly 
related to their chemical compositions, sizes, and surface structural characteristics 
[2].  Although Raman scattering is a well-established vibrational spectroscopic 
method in chemical analysis, its signals are generally too weak for use in 
immunoassays because most of the molecules exhibit low Raman scattering cross 
sections.  Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) offers a chance to increase 
the Raman intensities of molecules adsorbed onto rough metal NP surfaces by ca. 
 12
CE is one of the most powerful separation techniques [13]; it has been 
used to separate a variety of differently sized materials, including inorganic Au and 
Ag NPs [14–17].  Thus, a single sample can be rapidly analyzed using a volume 
as low as several nanoliters with simultaneous characterization of the 
size-dependent properties of its NPs. 
In this study, we investigated whether a relationship exists between the 
electrophoretic mobilities and sizes of Au/Ag core/shell NPs; if so, CE methods 
would provide a simple and rapid means for characterizing the stability of Au/Ag 
core/shell NPs over various storage times and for discovering stabilizer reagents 
that enhance their stability.  We believe that because CE involves short analysis 
times and has lower operating costs, it is a useful technique that may accelerate the 
analysis of future nanomaterials. 
 
3. Results 
Figure 1a displays the electropherograms of Au/Ag core/shell NPs having 
four different sizes (from 21.4 to 60.1 nm).  These Au/Ag core/shell NPs 
experience different migration times.  The sequence of migration times correlates 
to the increasing sizes of the Au/Ag core/shell NPs.  In CE separation, the 
migration time of an NP is strongly dependent on the electrical charge that it bears 
and also its size, with the electrophoretic mobility being proportional to its radius 
[16].  The migration behavior of the Au/Ag core/shell NPs in this study is 
consistent with previous findings [16].  Figure 1b indicates that a good linear 
relationship (R2 > 0.99) exists between the electrophoretic mobilities and the radii 
of the Au/Ag core/shell NPs.  This finding confirms that it is possible to employ 
CE to characterize the sizes of Au/Ag core/shell particles that have dimensions in 
the nanometer regime. 
For the practical application of CE to the routine characterization of the 
sizes of Au/Ag core/shell NPs, it is important to validate the reproducibility of their 
electrophoretic mobilities because it influences the precision of the characterization 
 14
process, Figure 2b presents the electropherograms of freshly prepared and 
six-day-old sample F.  The migration times these two samples were virtually 
unchanged at 2.59 and 2.60 min, respectively, with the migration times of the EOF 
of the two runs both being 1.11 min.  According to Figure 1b, the electrophoretic 
mobilities of the freshly prepared and six-day-old samples F correspond to particles 
having mean diameters of ca. 48.1 and 48.8 nm, respectively. 
For CE analysis, the process of characterizing the analytes takes less than 
4 min, which contrasts with the often one hour or more required when using SEM.  
By applying this CE method to the characterization of Au/Ag core/shell NPs, the 
overall analysis time can be reduced significantly. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, we have demonstrated a CE method for measuring the 
stability of Au/Ag core/shell NPs.  A linear relationship exists between the 
electrophoretic mobilities of Au/Ag core/shell NPs and their sizes; the relative 
standard deviation of the electrophoretic mobility was less than 1.1%.  We utilized 
this separation process to evaluate the feasibility of employing CE to measure the 
stability of Au/Ag core/shell NPs.  The CE approach requires far-shorter analysis 
times and involves lower operating costs; hence, it is a preferable method for 
routine analyses of the sizes of Au/Ag core/shell NPs.  We believe that analytical 
systems utilizing CE will be important for future investigations of NPs and 
nano-science in general.
