===========================================================================
Table 1 provides no indication of the precision of the sixty point estimators. If the
experiment were rerun with different random-number seeds, the cell entries would differ
from Table 1. The right-most digits would probably change; the left-most digits would
probably not change. Unlike the changing right-most digits, the unchanging left-most
digits provide information about the unknown performance measure. Table 1 works well
for Monte Carlo experiments run within a spread sheet such as MSexcel, since point-
estimator precision can be assessed visually by recalculating (hitting “F9”) a few times.
In less-interactive contexts, however, precision of a point estimator is often measured
by its standard error, ste, the square root of its variance. This measure is appropriate
when bias is zero or sample sizes are large, since then the bias is negligible compared
to its standard error. (Lewis and Orav 1988, Sections 6.1.2–6.1.3, is an excellent re-
view of moment estimation, including basic arguments for negligible bias and asymptotic
normality.)
Our goal is to modify Table 1 to provide precision information while preserving read-
ability. We argue here for something like Table 2, which differs from Table 1 only in the
content of each cell. Each cell now comprises two parts separated by a semicolon. The
second part contains only the leading digit (i.e., left-most non-zero digit) of the standard
error; the first part is the point estimate, omitting all digits to the right of the standard
error’s leading digit.

twice the space of the earlier tables, with twenty rather than ten lines. (This table is
identical to the SERVO output shown in the Appendix, except that the SERVO report
format uses one line for each point estimate and corresponding standard error.)
In addition to requiring additional space, Table 3 is more difficult to read than the
earlier tables because the standard errors interfere with scanning the point estimates.
Interleaving lines of point estimates with lines of standard errors is confusing in that they
provide quite different information. Standard errors provide secondary information about
the quality of the simulation experiment; point estimates provide primary information in
that they show properties of the system being analyzed.

Table 4 improves Table 3 by deleting right-most digits of both the point estimates
and standard errors. Specifically, each standard error is approximated by its leading two
digits (here with truncation) and the corresponding point-estimator digits are retained
to the same precision. Readability is improved a bit because the omitted digits create
white space. Not much statistical information is lost; later we argue for one digit less in
both the point estimate and standard error (as in Table 2). The disadvantage of Table 4
compared to Table 3 is that additional work (computer or human) is required to omit the
needless digits, which is why many output reports in practice contain all digits provided
by the computer. If the effort is made to omit needless digits to obtain Table 4, then we

number seed(s)).

3 The Leading-Digit Procedure and Format
The leading-digit procedure and format we propose in this paper are application specific,
as well as subject to the practitioner’s preferences. Our procedure and format are intended
to be widely applicable and appealing. We are guided by three criteria: (1) loss of
statistical information, (2) number of reported characters, and (3) appeal to all levels of
user sophistication. Of the three criteria, the second—number of positions available for
display—is fundamental; we take the amount of space available to be a constraint. The
third criterion—being useful to sophisticated users while not confusing casual users—is
important, but our recommendations are based on our subjective thoughts rather than
formal human experimentation.
3.1 Notation and definitions
We begin with some notation and definitions about the unknown performance-measure
value θ, the point estimator Θ̂, the point estimate θ̂, and its standard error ste. Through-
out, Greek letters refer to aspects of the point estimator and Roman letters refer to aspects
of the standard error.
7
3.3 Examples and discussion
Here are some examples of the leading-digit format. Suppose that θ̂ = 123.45678 and
ste = 0.011345. The leading-digits format produces the character string “123.46;1”. The
first six characters are θ̂ without its last three digits. The “;” sign separates the point
estimator from its precision indicator, which is dl = d−2 = 1, the leading digit of ste. The
“;” sign is simply a non-numeric separator. The digits δ̂−3 = 6, δ̂−4 = 7, δ̂−5 = 8 are
omitted because they are to the right of the trailing digit δ̂l = δ̂−2 = 5.
The string of characters needs to be modified for large and small values of θ̂, when the
lack of a decimal point leaves the magnitude ambiguous. For example θ̂ = 123456.78 and
ste = 113.45 results in the character string 1234XX; 1, where the character X is a place
holder. The digits δ̂1 = 5 and δ̂0 = 6 are not reported because the standard error’s value
indicates that their values are meaningless. For θ̂ = 1234567.8 and ste = 3113.45, the
scientific notation “1234E3;3”, with the character E indicating a power of ten, is used.
To demonstrate how the leading-digit format behaves under finite or infinite precision,
or with or without space constraint, we discuss three cases below. We consider a sequence
of eight examples in which the parameter θ̂ = 1234567.8 with the standard error getting
progressively larger.
3.3.1 Case 1: infinite-precision and unlimited space available
For now we assume that there are no space limitations and that θ̂ and ste are specified
to infinite precision.
Table 6: Examples of the leading-digit format with infinite-precision specified values and
unlimited space available for reporting
example θ̂ ste Leading-Digit Format
1 1234567.8 .0000311345 1234567.80000; 3
2 1234567.8 .00311345 1234567.800; 3
3 1234567.8 .311345 1234567.8; 3
4 1234567.8 31.1345 123456X; 3
5 1234567.8 3113.45 1234E3; 3
6 1234567.8 311345. 12E5; 3
7 1234567.8 311345E2 0E7; 3
8 1234567.8 311345E4 0E9; 3
In the first row of Table 6, the standard error .0000311345 is miniscule compared to
the point estimator, with the trailing digit δ̂−5 = 0 being specified only implicitly. The
corresponding leading-digit format contains thirteen digits—seven digits to the left of the
9
To be specific, the reported standard-error digit always corresponds to the trailing
digit of θ̂, even when the trailing digit is not δ̂l. In these cases the standard error’s value
is known only to be substantially less than required to ensure that the trailing digit is
known with negligible sampling error.
3.3.3 Case 3: single-precision and space for only eight characters
Table 8 again contains the same eight examples. A third restriction—space— is added to
the number of digits reported. In Table 7, the first four examples took nine characters.
When tabling results in simulation output or summarizing statistical data in general,
limiting results to a fixed number of characters simplifies the presentation of results.
In Table 8 we require that no more than eight characters are used in the leading-digit
format, changing the results for Examples 1–4. Two characters are required to specify
the precision, leaving only six characters for θ̂, which is expressed as 1235E3. Here again
the ; 0 means that the trailing digit is known with negligible sampling error.
Table 8: Examples of the leading-digit format with single-precision specified values and
space for only eight characters
example θ̂ ste Leading-Digit Format
1 1234567.8 .0000311345 1234E3; 0
2 1234567.8 .00311345 1234E3; 0
3 1234567.8 .311345 1234E3; 0
4 1234567.8 31.1345 1234E3; 0
5 1234567.8 3113.45 1234E3; 3
6 1234567.8 311345. 12E5; 3
7 1234567.8 311345E2 0E7; 3
8 1234567.8 311345E4 0E9; 3
An alternative to the leading-digit format when the standard-error digit is zero is
to omit ; 0, thereby freeing all eight characters to specify θ̂. Examples 1–3 would then
produce 1234567. with the interpretation that δ̂0 = 7 (with truncation) is known with
negligible sampling error. Example 4 would produce 123456XX but the value of δ̂6 has
substantial sampling error, although the eight-character leading-digit format has “; 0”.
For consistency across examples, we always show the semicolon and the leading digit of
the standard error.

The original SERVO output is reproduced below in Figure 1. That the original SERVO
output takes so much space was a motivation for our interest in developing a more-concise
reporting format.
