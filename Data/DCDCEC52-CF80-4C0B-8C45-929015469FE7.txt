2filtering problem is transfer into the
chain-scattering setting, the coprime factori
-zation approach for state-delayed systems
that one had developed in the last project
[8], can directly apply to the present filter
designl problem as well as the traditional
H control theory [6], [7]. Furthermore,
while combining the Youla parameterization
with the chain- scattering matrix
description, the present methods can yield a
family of the stable filters.

六、結論與討論
We have provided the state-space
representation of the specific doubly
coprime factorization for the systems with
delayed-time in both state and output, where
both coprime factors possess the same
delayed states as that of the original
systems. We have also stated the sufficient
condition for the state-delayed systems to be
conjugate (-J,-J’)–lossless. Since the
chain-scattering setting transforms the H
filtering problem into a simple lossless
network, the solving process thus is easy to
understand. This approach not only provides
a concise state-space approach to obtain a
family of the stable H filters for the
systems with delayed-states but the reduce
order H filter disign.
七、計畫成果自評
本計畫中我們針對狀態延遲及輸出部亦
含延遲狀態之 H 狀態估測器設計，提出
一種新的設計方式，其係結合我們先前計
畫所提出之狀態延遲系統互質分解方法，
讓我們可如傳統 H 控制法則一般，得到
一群穩定之狀態估測器，而且，此一法則
亦適用於同時滿足預設 H -norm規格之
狀態估測器降階設計問題。
