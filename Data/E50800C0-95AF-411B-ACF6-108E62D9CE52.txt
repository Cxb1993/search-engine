中文摘要 
在專案尚未進行的假設情況下，專案作業時間的分佈在專業計劃評核術的領域中已
有廣泛的討論。專案作業時間估算一般都是採用某種專案作業時間的分佈的期望值，常
見的專案作業時間分佈為 Beta 分佈。 
隨著專案的進行，一項已發動專案作業完成時間的期望值將因其條件式機率的改變
而受到影響。未能注意到此現象往往誤解以為進行中專案作業剩餘時間期望值，就是原
先推算此作業時間的期望值減去作業已進行的時間。本研究採用“條件式部份期望值＂
的觀念去估算一項已發動專案內，進行中作業剩餘時間的期望值。我們推導出專案作業
時間在一致分配、三角分配、Beta 分配、以及常態分配下的應用公式，供未來在專業計
劃評核術的進階研究使用。 
關鍵詞:  專案管理、計劃評核術、專案作業時間分佈。 
Abstract 
Studies on the probability distribution of project activity time have been widely 
discussed in the context of PERT under the situation where the activities have not started. 
The activity time is then estimated based on the expected value of various assumed 
probability distributions, predominantly, the Beta distribution.  
As the project proceeds, an activity in progress will affect the expected completion 
time of this activity through the change of conditional probabilities. Failing to recognize 
this fact often leads to the misconception that the remaining activity completion time is the 
estimated activity time minus the elapsed activity time. In this research, we develop the 
conditional partial expected value which can properly estimate the mean remaining 
activity completion time as the project proceeds. Formulas for such estimation are derived 
under the activity time distribution of uniform, triangular, Beta, and normal distributions 
for quick reference in the future studies of PERT. 
Keywords:  Project management; PERT; Activity time distribution 
Such partial expected value evaluates the mean activity time based on the possible activity 
times and the remaining associated probabilities ranging from k to b. However, in order to 
properly estimate the mean remaining activity completion time based on the posterior 
probabilities, we need to calculate the following “conditional partial expected value” defined 
as

In essence, this calculation adjusts the basis of the mean activity time to reflect the fact that the 
activity time has elapsed k－1 days (and is not completed yet). The conditional partial expected 
value thus “update” the mean activity completion time given that this activity has elapsed k－1 
days. As a result, the mean remaining activity completion time, denoted as Tr, can therefore be 
estimated as 
Tr = )1()( −− kkXμ . 
3. Inferences on various probability distributions of activity time 
We now consider the probability distribution of activity time under Uniform distribution, 
Triangular distribution, Beta distribution, and Normal distribution as in the following table.

Based on the concept of conditional partial expected value, this research derives the explicit 
formulas for the proper estimation of mean remaining completion time of a project activity, 
ranging from optimistic time a  to pessimistic time  after it has elapsed k－1 days, 
. These derived formulas are listed below:
