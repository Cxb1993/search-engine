2in which melt could be injected with precision on the order of micro grams. An arburg injection machine with 25 tons of
clamping force was used to batch produce plastic parts. We aimed to cut the cost per piece from US 1.2 dollars to 30
cents or less. The molding technique used here can also be extended to the production of other metal parts. Here, the
critical properties, including shrinkage, accuracy, cost, wear abrasion, and strength, of nylon polymer with added micro
particles were systematically established and compared with those of a metal material [17-18].
2.0 EXPERIMENTS
2.1 Materials and specimens
High performance polymer nylon 66 is an engineering thermoplastic with excellent physical wear resistance,
self-lubrication, and processing properties. Products produced with nylon 66 compound include rollers, bearings,
gearwheels etc. Thus, nylon 66 polymer was selected here as an experimental material to replace a metal material (S316
steel) that is widely used and commonly formed through metal powder injection molding. Plastic compounds with high
accuracy were produced in batches through microinjection molding. The materials used in this study included pure
nylon 66, nylon 66 with 15wt% added glass fillers, and nylon 66 with 15wt% added carbon fillers. The pure nylon 66
and nylon 66 with 15wt% added glass fillers were made by Toray Industries, Japan. The nylon 66 with 15wt% added
carbon fillers was made by DSM Engineering Plastics, The Netherlands.
The ball-sliding plate had a width of 6 mm, a length of 13 mm, and a 3.5 mm pitch diameter, as shown in Fig. 2. A
round specimen with a diameter of 8 mm and a thickness of 10 mm was selected to perform wear tests (ASTM G99-04).
In addition, a dog-bone with a thickness of 4 mm, a width of 10 mm, and a length of 60 mm was selected to perform
tensile tests (ASTM D638).
2.2 Processing windows
The processing window is an effective tool for finding the range of processing parameters for manufacturing high
quality parts. In this experiment, the injection pressure and the melt temperature were significant processing parameters.
The injection pressure and melt temperature were also varied point by point to find the processing window. Short-shot
or flash in parts was located outside the boundary of the processing window. The permissible injection pressure, called
the mechanical ability, could not exceed 2,300 bars in this window. All the tests were conducted using an Arburg
injection machine (25 tons, 220S).
2.3 Quality evaluation
To examine the shrinkage and accuracy of the polymer compounds, parts made with nylon 66 with glass and
carbon fillers were compared with metal parts in this study. They were measured with a coordinate measurement
machine (CMM, Poly, Italy). The precision level of the measurements was 1 micron. The dimensions of the mold
cavities for nylon 66 polymer and S316 metal were enlarged in advance by 1.3% and 19.5%, respectively, to
compensate the shrinkage of parts. After molding, the S316 metal parts needed to be sintered at a temperature of 1300oC
for 2 hours. The pitch dominates the quality of ball-screw plates. Thus, here, the shrinkage in pitch of the ball-screw
plate was analyzed. The shrinkage () could be calculated as follows:
(1),%100
p
pp
where p represents the pitch dimension in the mold cavities which were enlarged in advance by 1.3% and 19.5%,
respectively, for the nylon 66 compounds and S316 metal. prepresents the pitch dimension in the parts that were
measured after injection molding in the case of the nylon 66 compounds and sintered at a temperature of 1300oC in the
case of the S316 metal. The average shrinkage of the parts was determined based on ten specimens. The reproducibility
of the parts was evaluated as a standard of accuracy. Ten measured plastic parts were selected from the eleventh to the
twentieth mold. That is, the first ten pieces were discarded because their quality was unstable. The allowable deviation
in the precision of parts currently available on the market is normally 20 µm. Thus, the level of accuracy achieved here
was considered acceptable when the deviation in the precision of the parts was less than 20 µm.
Wear tests were carried out by using a pin-on-disk tester (Micro phonics, USA). The surface roughness of the disk,
which was 120 mm in diameter, was 0.2 µm (Ra). Round specimens were placed in contact with the disk at a position
located 37 mm from the center and rotated from 5,000 (1.16km) to 40,000 revolutions (9.30km) with a step increase of
5,000 revolutions at a constant speed of 70 rpm. The vertical load on the pin was 0.75kg. The specimens were cleaned
and dried after they were rotated. Then, the weight of each specimen was measured using an electronic weighing
machine (Honeywell, UK). The weight loss ( W ) was then calculated as follows:
W = %100
W
WW  , (2)
where W is the weight before wearing and Wis the weight after wearing. To achieve high quality, low weight loss is
4glass fillers, and nylon 66 with 15wt% added carbon fillers was 1.6%, 1.46%, and 1.13%, respectively. Nylon 66 with
15wt% added carbon fillers exhibited the least shrinkage. The shrinkage of polymer with 15wt% added glass fillers was
next greatest. The shrinkage of polymer with 15wt% added carbon fillers was 0.34% lower than that of pure nylon 66.
This clearly shows that adding fillers to the polymer effectively reduced shrinkage. When the polymer was in the
melting stage, the fillers with lower expansion coefficient reduced the activity of the molecules, resulting in
significantly lower volume expansion of the molecules. Then, crystallization of the molecules was retarded by the fillers
during the frozen stage. Thus, shrinkage was reduced when fillers were added to the polymer.
However, the shrinkage in the pitch of the parts made with S316 metal was 17.07% which represented a 2.43%
deviation from the designed shrinkage. The shrinkage of the S316 metal parts was difficult to control because they had
to be sintered at a high temperature of 1300oC after metal injection molding. The tolerance in the metal parts, thus, was
higher and random. The results revealed that the nylon composites made through microinjection molding exhibited
significantly lower tolerance and shrinkage than the S316 metal parts made using metal injection molding did.
As Fig. 5 shows, larger error deviations occurred with the polymer compound with added glass fillers. We
speculated that a possible reason could be that the glass particles were not uniformly distributed in the polymer
compound. In order to determine the actual reason for this result, an SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy, Jeol,
JSM-6700F) image of the polymer compound with 15wt% added glass fillers was taken and is shown in Fig. 6. The
nylon 66 compound with 15wt% added glass fillers showed agglomeration. Large error deviations among the ten
specimens thus occurred, because the glass particles were not uniformly distributed in the polymer compound.
Meanwhile, smaller error deviations occurred in the case of the polymer compound with added carbon fillers. The
particles were uniformly distributed in the polymer compound with 15wt% added carbon fillers, as shown in Fig. 7. The
error deviations among the ten specimens were small, because the carbon particles were uniformly distributed in the
polymer compound. The same conditions were found in the tensile tests, which will be discussed in the last section. The
varying uniformity of the different fillers induced error deviations in shrinkage and strength. The kneading of the
polymer and fillers was the key factor affecting the uniformity of the composites [9-10]. The nylon compounds with
added glass and carbon fillers, respectively, were provided by different vendors. Thus, uniform distribution of fillers in
polymers is required for the production of reinforced composites.
A photograph of three different ball-sliding plates, which were used to verify the measured shrinkage of the
polymer compounds, is shown in Fig. 8. The ball-sliding plates at the top had a width of 3 mm and a length of 13 mm,
and were made with pure nylon 66. The mold cavity had previously been enlarged by 1.6%. The ball-sliding plates at
the bottom left had a width of 5 mm and a length of 11 mm and were made with nylon 66 with 15wt% added glass
fillers. This mold cavity had previously been enlarged by 1.5%. The ball-sliding plates at the bottom right were made
with nylon 66 with 15wt% added carbon fillers. In this case, the mold cavity had previously been enlarged by 1.2%. It
can be observed from the photograph that the plastic parts were well formed through microinjection molding. The
average tolerances of the plastic parts, made in mold cavities that had been enlarged, were between 3 and 6 µm, which
was far less than 20 µm. The results clearly show that plastic parts could be made with high precision and
reproducibility when precise shrinkage was achieved in the mold cavity.
3.4 Wear behavior of metal and polymer compounds with added fillers
The weight loss of the nylon 66 compounds with different added fillers and the S316 metal is shown in Fig. 9. The
surface roughness of the wear disk was 0.2 µm (Ra). The wear loss increased steadily as the rotation distance increased
for every tested specimen. The weight loss reached 3.44%, 0.81%, 0.38%, and 0.16%, respectively, for the metal, pure
nylon 66, nylon 66 with 15wt% added glass fillers, and nylon 66 with 15wt% added carbon fillers after the specimens
were rotated about 9 km. The weight loss of the S316 metal increased significantly, while the weight loss of the nylon
66 compound with added carbon fillers increased very little. The pure nylon 66 and nylon with 15% added carbon
fillers resisted wear abrasion applied 4 and 10 times, respectively, more than the metal material did. This contradicts the
intuition that metal exhibits better wear resistance.
In order to understand the wear behavior of the nylon 66 polymer and S316 metal, an SEM image of the pure
nylon 66 polymer following wearing was taken and is shown in Fig. 10. The worn surface of the pure nylon 66 was
slightly damaged, because nylon 66 polymer is self-lubricating and can resist wear abrasion. On the other hand, the
worn surface of the S316 metal showed serious damage, as shown in Fig. 11, resulting in significant weight loss. In
addition, 5W40 oil (Aral, German) was used to lubricate the disk surface as a metal specimen was wearing. The weight
loss of the metal specimen was effectively decreased when lubrication oil was added to its 0.2 µm rough surface. The
weight loss of the metal material with 5W40 lubrication was very close to that of the pure nylon 66 polymer. However,
the lubrication oil easily induced pollution and increased the required labor.
In contrast, the weight loss decreased significantly when fillers were added to the polymer compound. The weight
loss decreased by 0.43% and 0.65%, respectively, for polymer compound with added glass and carbon particles
compared with pure nylon 66. The wear abrasion was the least in the case of nylon 66 polymer with added carbon fillers.
During wearing, the polymer in the compound was stripped, leaving only the carbon fillers, which were much harder
