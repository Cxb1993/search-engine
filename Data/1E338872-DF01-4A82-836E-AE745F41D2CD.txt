摘要
對於使用暗物法(dark target method)反演氣膠時，通常假設地表為均勻。如此所反演之
氣膠光厚度(aerosol optical depth)便會被高估。此誤差亦會經由大氣改正而傳播到所反演之
地表反射率，尤其是對於具 8 米空間解析度之福衛二號(又名華衛二號) RSI 而言。本研究
估計經由暗物法在忽略周圍效應(adjacency effect)假設下所求之氣膠光厚度誤差，傳播到大
氣改正所反演地面反射率之誤差分析。結果顯示，除了低反差、亮物之外，所反演地面反
射率之誤差相當顯著，亦即可大於 0.01。暗物誤差大於亮物。暗物反射率之誤差會因為大
氣改正時之氣膠誤差而加強。其可以大於 35%(暗物)，小於 10%(亮物)。因此建議周圍效應，
除了低反差、亮物之外，均需考慮於氣膠光厚度反演以及大氣改正之過程。

Abstract
Homogeneous surface is usually assumed in aerosol retrieval for the dark target method.
Retrieved aerosol optical depth can thus be overestimated. This error will also be propagated
into retrieved surface reflectance during atmospheric correction, especially for high spatial
resolution of 8 m for FORMOSAT-2 (also known as ROCSAT-2) RSI. The error in retrieved
surface reflectance during atmospheric corrections induced by retrieved aerosol optical depth
error due to adjacency effect over a dark target is studied in the green and red bands of
FORMOSAT-2 RSI. The results show that significant errors in retrieved surface reflectance, i.e.
larger than 0.01, may occur in most cases except at low contrast for a bright target. Such an
error for a dark target is larger than that for a bright target for given contrast and haziness.
Relatively, the error of retrieved surface reflectance is enhanced by the introduced error of
aerosol optical depth in atmospheric correction for dark targets. The error can be larger than
35% for dark targets and less than 10% for bright targets. Hence, it is suggested that adjacency
effect be considered from aerosol optical depth retrieval to surface reflectance retrieval in
atmospheric correction except at low contrast for bright targets.

over the DT including LC with b of 0.06
and MC with b of 0.11 are considered,
according to Lyapustin and Kaufman (2001).
3. Results and Discussion
Before estimation of the errors in c for
AC, AOD retrieval over the DT is performed
under the assumption of homogeneous surface.
The errors in the retrieved AOD are reported
in green and red bands for different haziness,
v and contrasts (Table 1a and b). The
values of s and  are 30o and 0o,
respectively. The mean absolute and relative
errors A and R are determined from the
errors over the DT with b ranging from
0.01 to 0.21. As indicated in the previous
study (Liu, 2005), ( )A a increases as the
AOD increases and/or the contrast increases.
This is because of neglecting stronger
scattered radiance due to the homogeneous
surface assumption. Table 1a and b also
show that ( )A a decreases as v increases.
This is due to the fact that atmospheric
reflectance increases and the proportion of the
scattering attributed to adjacent surface
decreases when v increases. However,
compared with the sensitivity to contrast and
AOD, ( )A a is less sensitive to v . In
fact, one can see that ( )A a is most
sensitive to contrast, which is consistent with
the results of Lyapustin and Kaufman (2001),
and least sensitive to v for the ranges of
three parameters discussed. In both bands,
( )A a can exceed 0.1 for LC in hazy sky and
0.2 for MC in both skies. Even for LC in
clear sky, ( )A a can be 0.07 at nadir.
Although the values of ( )A a in both bands
differ only less than 0.05, the induced ( )A c 
in the green band can be up to 0.05 greater
than that in the red band, which will be
discussed later. Hence ( )A a can be quite
significant especially for MC and/or hazy sky.
As for ( )R a , it increases as AOD decreases
and/or contrast increases. ( )R a also
decreases with v. ( )R a can be at least
16% for LC in hazy sky at v=45o and up to
105% for MC in clear sky at nadir in the red
band. The latter error seems to be reasonable,
since this error at 30-m spatial resolution is
reported to exceed 100% for the same
conditions (Lyapustin and Kaufman, 2001).
In the green band, the values of ( )R a
ranging from 15% to 103% are similar to that
in the red band. These results show the need to
consider AE in aerosol retrieval especially for
MC.
The error in retrieved AOD due to AE
may cause an error in derived surface
reflectance in AC, since surface reflectance is
retrieved by inverting TOA with the same
parameters given in the simulation of TOA ,
except for the retrieved AOD. As pointed
out by Fraser and Kaufman (1985) and
Kaufman (1989), critical reflectance (CR) is
defined as the surface reflectance where TOA
stays essentially constant as a increases.
CR depends on aerosol optical characteristics,
sun and viewing geometry. At CR, as a
increases, the amount of increase in
atmospheric reflectance due to more aerosol
backscattering is equal to that of the decrease
in surface reflection owing to decreased
atmospheric transmittance. The amount of
decrease in the surface reflection is weighted
by surface reflectance. For c<CR, TOA
increases with increasing a, and for c>CR,
TOA decreases with increasing a . As
mentioned above, CR has been defined as the
surface reflectance where TOA stays
essentially constant with varying a. To see
the performance of CR under a heterogeneous
surface assumption, TOA is plotted as a
function of c and b for different a in
the red band of FORMOSAT-2 RSI (Fig. 1).
s is 30o. For given contrast and haziness,
when c increases, ( )A c  decreases from
the maximum, reaches a minimum value and
then increases. The minimum of ( )A c 
occurs in CRR. It is interesting to note that
CRs for both contrasts are the same in clear
sky, i.e. 0.13 as well as in hazy sky, i.e. 0.17.
As discussed above, it is because CR increases
as a increases for low b (Fig. 2(a)).
The CR is around 0.09 when a changes
from 0.2 to 0.6, and it is around 0.14 when a
changes from 0.6 to 1.0. This is because for
low b, a lower value of CR can be enough
to balance the increase in atmospheric
reflectance and the decrease in surface
reflection as a increases in clear sky;
however, an increase in atmospheric
reflectance due to the increase of a should
be compensated with the larger attenuation of
surface reflection, i.e. larger value of CR, in
hazy sky. Since the behavior of ( )A c  due
to a as a function of c for different
contrasts and haziness in the green band is
similar to that in the red band (Fig. 5), its
figure is omitted. However, quantitative
analysis is reported. For a DT, ( )A c 
increases as ( )A a increases from clear sky
to hazy sky for given contrast and/or from LC
to MC for given haziness (Table 1). For a
BT in the green band, i.e. c =0.16~0.21
(Lyapustin and Kaufman, 2001), ( )A c 
remains relatively stable from clear sky to
hazy sky for given contrast for nadir view;
however, it also increases as ( )A a
increases for v at 45o. In the red band,
( )A c  remains relatively stable from clear
sky to hazy sky for given contrast. For a BT,
( )A c  also increases with increased ( )A a
for given haziness in both bands. For nadir
view, ( )A c  ranges from 0.010 for LC in
clear sky to 0.111 for MC in hazy sky for a
DT and is still greater than 0.01 for BT at MC
in the green band. In the red band, it varies
from 0.008 to 0.084 for a DT and is also
greater than 0.01 for a BT at MC. The
values of ( )A c  for a DT in both bands are
larger than that for a BT with given contrast
and haziness. The result of ( )A c  at
v=45o will be discussed later. The values of
( )R c  for DTs are larger than 44% and can
be up to 481% for MC in hazy sky in the
green band. In the red band, they are larger
than 35% and can also be up to 370% for MC
in hazy sky. However, they are smaller than
8% for BTs in both bands. Quantitatively,
( )A c  can be only negligible for BTs at LC.
For a DT and MC in hazy sky at nadir view,
( )A c  can be very significant, i.e. 0.111 and
0.084, in green and red bands, respectively.
4. Conclusions
The error in retrieved surface reflectance
in AC induced by the error in retrieved AOD
due to AE over a DT is studied in the green
and red bands of FORMOSAT-2 RSI.
Simulation results show that the positive bias
of the retrieved AOD due to AE over a DT can
underestimate the surface reflectance of a DT
and overestimate the surface reflectance of a
BT in both bands. It is suggested that AE be
considered from AOD retrieval to surface
reflectance retrieval in AC except at LC for a
BT.
