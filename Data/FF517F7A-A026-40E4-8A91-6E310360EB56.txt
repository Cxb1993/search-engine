Abstract 
Although the design and applications of linear 
tuned mass damper (TMD) systems are well 
developed, nonlinear TMD systems are still 
developing. In this study, the application of multiple 
semi-active friction tuned mass dampers 
(SAF-MTMD) for response control of a multistory 
structure under seismic excitation is investigated. 
The friction forces of the SAF-MTMD are 
controllable. A non-sticking friction (NSF) controller, 
which is able to keep each of the TMD activated and 
in its slip state throughout an earthquake with 
arbitrary intensity, was conducted. A parametric 
study is performed to investigate the effectiveness of 
SAF-MTMD. The seismic performance of the 
SAF-MTMD is also compared with the single and 
multiple passive friction tuned mass dampers 
(PF-TMD/PF-MTMD). The numerical result shows 
that the SAF-MTMD is superior to PF-MTMD in 
reducing the response of the primary structure under 
the seismic excitation. 
Keywords: Tuned mass damper (TMD), multiple 
tuned mass damper (MTMD), friction, passive 
control, semi-active control. 
I. Introduction 
Tuned mass damper (TMD) is a wildly used 
strategy in the area of structural control [1-8]. A 
TMD system consists of added mass with properly 
3 
investigated. The friction forces of the SAF-MTMD 
are controllable. A non-sticking friction (NSF) 
controller, which is able to keep each of the 
SAF-TMD activated and in its slip state throughout 
an earthquake with arbitrary intensity, was 
conducted. A parametric study is performed to 
investigate the effectiveness of the SAF-MTMD. 
The seismic performance of the SAF-MTMD is also 
compared with the single and multiple passive tuned 
mass dampers (PF-TMD/PF-MTMD). 
II. Modeling of MDOF system with 
   SAF-MTMD 
Fig. 1 illustrates the mathematic model of a 
multi-story (n-story) shear building controlled by p 
SAF-TMDs at roof. In Fig. 1, ksi represents the 
stiffness of the ith TMD; Fi(t) is the variable friction 
force of the ith TMD. In addition, in Fig. 1, the mass 
of the ith TMD is denoted by msi, and the ith floor 
mass, damping, stiffness of the primary structure is 
denoted by the notations mpi, cpi and kpi. Symbol xpi(t) 
represents the ith floor relative-to-the-ground 
displacement of the primary structure while vsi(t) 
denotes the stroke of the ith TMD. The whole 
system has (n+p) degrees of freedom. The dynamic 
equation of the mathematic model shown in Fig. 1 
can be represented by

sliding state. If the SAF-TMD is in its stick state, its 
energy absorption capacity goes to zero. Although it 
doesn’t necessarily affect asymptotic stability, it 
does reduce the rate at which system energy is 
dissipated. The SAF-TMD will remain sliding if

where β is a parameter representing the measure of 
the thickness of the boundary layer. Fig. 2 shows the 
function values of tanh(βx) with different β values. A 
large β causes a function value to increase rapidly to 
1.0, implying that clamping force, Fi(t), increases 
rapidly when a large β is used. Equation (17) is 
called the NSF controller.

IV. Numerical analysis method 
Since a structure controlled by such a 
PF-MTMD or an SAF-MTMD becomes a nonlinear 
system, a numerical method is generally required to 
analyze its dynamic behavior. The discrete-time 
solution of Eq. (5) may be written in an incremental 
form [25]:

Eq. (18) is called the discrete-time state-space 
equation. In the equation, the constant coefficient 
matrices Ad, Bd, and Ed can be treated as the 
discrete-time counterparts of the matrices Ac, Bc, 
and Ec in Eq. (7), respectively. In addition, Δt 
denotes the time interval (sampling period) for 
analysis. Eq. (18) states that response z[k+1]of the 
(k+1)-th time step can be computed based on state 
z[k], excitation ][kxg&& , friction force F[k], which are 
all evaluated at the previous time step, i.e., the k-th 
step. Because of the NSF controller can prevent the 
SAF-MTMD in its stick state, the F[k] can be 
directly determined by Eq. (17) for the SAF-MTMD. 
On the other hand, the PF-MTMD may stick during 
an earthquake. In such a situation, the friction force 
F[k] should be computed using the force balance and 
kinetic conditions of a friction mechanism [30]. 
V. Numerical model and  
  Ground acceleration record 
In this section, a 3-story shear building 
equipped with an SAF-MTMD and controlled by the 
NSF controller is studied numerically. Its control 
performance will be compared with the same 
structure equipped with a PF-MTMD. Table 1 lists 
the structural matrices and modal parameters of the 
3-story structure before the control devices are 
installed. These structural parameters were 
synthesized from a modal testing performed on an 
actual 3-story steel frame erected in the earthquake 
simulation laboratory of the National Center for 
Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), 
Taipei, Taiwan. This frame has been extensively 
used for experimental studies of various structural 
control devices. In our simulation, the time interval 
for numerical analysis was taken to be 0.005 second.    
In the following discussions, the term 
“displacement” represents the relative-to-the-ground 
displacement; while, the term “acceleration” denotes 
the absolute acceleration.

PF-MTMD system is 5%. 
For the SAF-MTMD, Figs. 6 and 7 compare the 
maximum response contours (normalized by the 
uncontrolled case) as a function of control parameter 
β and Rf subjected to the El Centro earthquake (PGA 
scaled to 0.3g). The contour lines of different values 
show different reduction levels (%) of maximum 3F 
responses for parameters of β and Rf. An optimal 
region exists for the chosen β and Rf. From Figs. 6 
and 7, a proper β and Rf for the SAF-MTMD is taken 
to be 0.5 and 5%. Table 3 lists the results of 
parametric study for PF-MTMD and SAF-MTMD 
systems. These values will be used in the following 
subsections.

VIII. Conclusions 
In this study, the application of multiple 
semi-active friction tuned mass dampers 
(SAF-MTMD) for response control of a multistory 
structure under seismic excitation is investigated. 
The friction forces of the SAF-MTMD are 
controllable. A non-sticking friction (NSF) controller, 
which is able to keep each of the TMD activated and 
in its slip state throughout an earthquake with 
arbitrary intensity, was conducted. A parametric 
study is performed to investigate the effectiveness of 
SAF-MTMD. The seismic performance of the 
SAF-MTMD is also compared with the single and 
multiple passive tuned mass dampers 
(PF-TMD/PF-MTMD). The numerical result shows 
that in large PGA levels of the earthquake, both 
PF-MTMD and SAF-MTMD are effective in 
suppressing structure responses. On the other hand, 
in small PGA levels of the earthquake, the 
performance of the PF-MTMD is closed to that of 
the uncontrolled case because the PF-MTMD is not 
activated effectively. The SAF-MTMD is also 
effective in small PGA levels and can prevent a 
residual TMD stroke that may occur in a 
PF-MTMD.
