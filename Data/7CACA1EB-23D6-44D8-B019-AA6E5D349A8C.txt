advantages of using the InGaAs-OI(NFET)/GeOI(PFET) 
SRAM cells, and propose the optimized threshold-
voltage (Vt) designs to enhance the variation 
immunity for high-performance and low-voltage 
applications, respectively. Besides, we present a 
comparative leakage analysis of GeOI FinFET and Ge 
bulk FinFET at device and circuit levels, and 
evaluate the effectiveness of various high Vt 
technology options for leakage reduction. Our results 
indicate that using drain-side underlap is a more 
effective strategy to reduce leakage for Ge FinFETs 
compared with increasing gate length or channel 
doping.

Germanium and III-V materials such as 
InGaAs have recently been proposed [1-6] as 
alternative channel materials of future CMOS 
devices for higher mobility and current drive. 
This 2-year project aims to conduct a 
comprehensive evaluation for CMOS logic 
circuits and memories using these hetero-
channel devices. Advanced device structures 
such as ultra-thin-body (UTB) and FinFET 
devices are used in our assessment of Ge and 
III-V channel based logic and SRAM 
applications. 
In the first year, we have investigated the 
logic circuits and SRAM cells using UTB 
Germanium-on-Insulator (GeOI) MOSFETs. 
With technology scaling, the off state leakage 
current has increased drastically and leakage 
power has become a major contributor to the 
total power. Due to lower band-gap, the Ge 
channel devices suffer from larger band-to-
band tunneling leakage current than the Si 
counterparts. Several studies [7-11] have 
compared the electrostatics and performance 
of GeOI and SOI devices. However, a 
comprehensive investigation of UTB GeOI 
logic circuits and SRAM cells is still lacking. 
Therefore, we conduct a comparative analysis 
on the leakage, delay, and stability of UTB 
GeOI logic circuits and SRAM cells with 
respect to the UTB SOI counterparts using 
physics-based TCAD simulation. The impacts 
of temperature, Vdd scaling, gate length, and 
the leakage dependence on input patterns for 
GeOI circuits are analyzed.  
In the second year, we examine the 
advantages of the InGaAs-
OI(NFET)/GeOI(PFET) SRAM cells. 
Although SRAM cells with III-V channel 
MOSFETs have been studied and improved 
performance has been reported [12, 13], the 
higher leakage and variability may be a 
concern for III-V channel MOSFETs in 
SRAM applications. In this project, the 
stability, variability, performance and cell 
leakage of III-V-OI and GeOI SRAM cells are 
analyzed under two scenarios (InGaAs-
OI(NFET)/GeOI(PFET) and GeOI 
NFET/PFET) and compared with the SOI 
SRAM cells. We show that hetero-channel 
SRAM cells with optimized threshold voltage 
(Vt) design exhibit improved stability and 
performance, and comparable variability 
compared with the SOI SRAM cells.  
In addition, we conduct a comparative 
leakage analysis of GeOI FinFET and 
Germanium on bulk substrate FinFET (Ge 
bulk FinFET) at device and circuit levels. Si-
on-Insulator (SOI) FinFET and Si bulk 
FinFET had been studied in the past [14]-[16], 
and results showed that Si FinFET on bulk 
substrate with optimized Punch-Through 
Stopper (PTS) doping [17] underneath the 
channel region can exhibit comparable 
performance and leakage with that on SOI 
substrate. However, a comparative leakage 
analysis between GeOI FinFET and Ge bulk 
FinFET has rarely been seen. In this project, 
the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) leakage 
current in the GeOI FinFET is shown to be 
amplified due to the bipolar effect, and various 
device design strategies for mitigating the 
bipolar gain (Œ≤) and leakage current of GeOI 
FinFETs are examined.

1. GeOI Logic Circuits and SRAM Cells  
Fig. 1 shows the impact of temperature on 
the off currents (Ioff at Vgs = 0V and Vds = 
Vdd) for the UTB GeOI and SOI devices at 
various Vdd, respectively. At high Vdd (1.0V), 
the Ioff of UTB GeOI device exhibits weaker 
temperature dependence than the UTB SOI 
device, since the Ioff of GeOI device is 
dominated by the band-to-band tunneling 
leakage with lower temperature sensitivity 
 4 
Fig. 5 (top) illustrates the bias condition for 
evaluating the worst-case noise of dynamic 
gates (where the dynamic node remains 
‚ÄúHigh‚Äù). As clock goes ‚Äúhigh‚Äù, the dynamic 
node voltage is reduced (Œî Vdn) due to 
leakage currents through the input logic 
branches (legs). Fig. 5 (top) shows the 
dynamic node voltage droop comparison 
between GeOI and SOI dynamic gates. At Vdd 
= 1.0V and 300K, GeOI dynamic gate shows 
slightly larger ŒîVdn than the SOI dynamic 
gate. However, at 400K, GeOI dynamic gate 
shows around 5 times improvement in ŒîVdn 
(number of legs = 32) than the SOI counterpart 
because SOI devices have larger temperature 
sensitivity and higher subthreshold leakage 
currents.Fig. 5 (bottom) illustrates the bias 
condition for evaluating the worst-case delay 
of dynamic gates (dynamic node evaluates to 
‚ÄúLow‚Äù) with, only one pull-down stack to 
discharge the dynamic node. Fig. 5 (bottom) 
shows the worst-case delay comparisons 
between GeOI and SOI dynamic gates. As can 
be seen, GeOI dynamic gate shows 
comparable worst-case delay at 300K, and 
smaller delay at 400K compared with the SOI 
counterpart. Compared with the GeOI 
dynamic gate with 32 legs, the SOI dynamic 
gate shows 1.4 times increase in the worst-
case delay at 400K. As temperature rises from 
300K to 400K, the SOI dynamic gate shows 
larger degradation in the worst-case delay than 
the GeOI counterpart due to its larger mobility 
and drive-current degradation. 
Fig. 6(a) shows that the GeOI 6T SRAM 
cell with larger threshold voltage exhibits 
larger Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM) than 
the SOI counterpart at both 300K and 400K. 
The definition of RSNM is shown in Fig. 6(b) 
inset. The 6T GeOI SRAM cell with larger 
threshold voltage shows smaller read disturb 
voltage than the 6T SOI SRAM cell with 
smaller threshold voltage because the pass-
gate transistor is very sensitive to threshold 
voltage at Vdd = 0.5V ~ 1V. As temperature 
changes from 300K to 400K, the RSNMs for 
both GeOI and SOI SRAM cells decrease 
because the threshold voltages for GeOI and 
SOI devices decrease. Fig. 6(b) shows that the 
GeOI SRAM cell shows comparable Write 
Static Noise Margin (WSNM) at Vdd=1V and 
smaller WSNM at Vdd=0.5V compared with 
the SOI SRAM cell at 300K. The definition of 
WSNM is shown in the Fig. 6(b) inset.  
Fig. 7 shows the degradation of 
RSNM/WSNM due to LER for UTB GeOI 
and SOI SRAM cells at Vdd = 1V and 0.5V. 
At Vdd = 1V (0.5V), GeOI SRAM cell 
exhibits smaller (larger) œÉ RSNM and œÉ
WSNM than the SOI SRAM cell. UTB GeOI 
SRAM cell shows larger ùùÅRSNM/œÉRSNM 
than the SOI SRAM cell at both Vdd = 1V and 
0.5V due to its larger ùùÅRSNM. Fig. 8 show 
that UTB GeOI SRAM cell exhibits smaller 
cell leakage for Vdd < 0.8V at 300K, and for 
Vdd = 0.5 ~ 1V at 400K. The UTB GeOI 
SRAM cell also exhibits smaller cell leakage 
variation considering LER than the SOI 
SRAM cells for Vdd = 0.5V ~ 1V at both 
300K and 400K.  
 
2. InGaAs-OI(NFET)/GeOI(PFET) SRAM 
Cells  
Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b) show that the RSNM 
and WSNM comparisons between InGaAs-
OI/GeOI SRAM cells and SOI SRAM cells 
with (same-) high-Vt design. As can be seen, 
the InGaAs-OI/GeOI SRAM cells show 15% 
and 18% improvements in RSNM and WSNM 
at Vdd = 1V respectively compared with the 
high-Vt SOI SRAM cells. The insets of Fig. 
9(a) and Fig. 9(b) show the improvement in 
RSNM and WSNM over SOI SRAM cells by 
using InGaAs-OI/GeOI SRAM cells. Fig. 9(c) 
shows the Ids-Vgs characteristics of UTB 
InGaAs-OI, GeOI and SOI MOSFETs with 
same high-Vt design. The InGaAs-OI NFET 
shows around 80% improvement in Ion 
compared with the SOI NFET. Therefore, the 
InGaAs-OI/GeOI SRAM cells have both 
 6 
shown in the Fig. 14 inset. The band-gap 
widening due to quantum confinement is 
considered for the 7nm fin width (Wfin) GeOI 
and Ge bulk FinFETs in this work. The 
GeOI/Ge bulk FinFETs and circuits are  
analyzed using TCAD mixed-mode 
simulations. 
Si bulk FinFET with optimized doping 
shows similar intrinsic device performance 
(Ioff vs. Ion) compared with the SOI FinFET 
at high and low Vds [14, 15]. Fig. 14 shows 
that the GeOI FinFET exhibits comparable 
DIBL, subthreshold swing, and leakage at Vds 
= 0.05V as compared with the Ge bulk FinFET 
with PTS. However, the leakage currents are 
different between the GeOI FinFET and the 
Ge bulk FinFET at Vds = 1V. 
Fig. 15 illustrates the leakage components 
for the GeOI FinFET and Ge bulk FinFET at 
Vgs = 0V and Vds = 1V. The leakage 
components of the GeOI FinFETs include the 
BTBT hole current (Ib,hole), the amplified 
BTBT current (Œ≤ x Ib,hole) due to bipolar 
effect [32], and the subthreshold leakage 
current (Isub-vt), while the leakage 
components of Ge bulk FinFETs only include 
the BTBT hole current (Ib,hole), and the 
subthreshold leakage current (Isub-vt). 
For Ge bulk FinFET, as BTBT occurs, 
Ib,hole flows into the substrate contact and 
hole concentration in the channel is much 
lower than the GeOI FinFET. Therefore, the 
BTBT induced bipolar effect is not observed 
in the Ge bulk FinFETs. The total leakage Ioff 
for Ge bulk FinFET equals the sum of Ib,hole 
and Isub-vt. The leakage components of the 
GeOI FinFET and Ge bulk FinFET at various 
Vds are shown in Fig. 15. The Ioff of GeOI 
FinFET is dominated by the BTBT induced 
bipolar current (Œ≤ x Ib,hole) at Vds > 0.4V. 
For Ge bulk FinFET, the Ioff is dominated by 
the BTBT leakage (Ib,hole) at Vds > 0.6V, and 
by the subthreshold leakage (Isub-vt) at Vds < 
0.6V. Therefore, the BTBT induced bipolar 
leakage needs to be taken into account for 
GeOI FinFET when it is compared with the Ge 
bulk FinFET. 
Power-performance optimization often 
requires devices with multiple threshold 
voltages (Vt) [32-34]. High threshold voltage 
(HVT) transistors are typically employed for 
noncritical paths to reduce the leakage, while 
low threshold voltage (LVT) transistors are 
used for the critical paths.  Several kinds of 
device design can be used to achieve high-Vt 
transistors. Asymmetric gate-to-source/drain 
underlap devices have been used in the SRAM 
cell to adjust the threshold voltages and 
improve the cell leakage and stability [26, 27]. 
Increasing gate length was used in a 
microprocessor design [35]. Increasing the 
channel doping increases the total depletion 
charge in the device channel, hence increasing 
the Vt. Fig. 16 shows the schematics of low-Vt  
(LVT, Lg = 18nm) and different high-Vt 
(HVT) FinFETs options including drain-side 
underlap (Lund = 4nm), increasing channel 
doping (Nch' = 2e18cm-3), and increasing gate 
length (Lg' = 22nm). The effectiveness of the 
HVT options to suppress the BTBT induced 
bipolar leakage in the GeOI FinFET is 
examined. 
Fig. 17 shows the leakage comparisons of 
LVT and HVT FinFET options for the GeOI 
and Ge bulk FinFETs at Vds = 1V. The 
leakage current of GeOI FinFET is dominated 
by the bipolar current (Œ≤ x Ib,hole), and the 
leakage current of Ge bulk FinFET is 
dominated by the band-to-band tunneling 
current (Ib,hole) at Vds = 1V. For GeOI and 
Ge bulk FinFETs at Vds = 1V, drain-side 
underlap (HVT(Lund)) shows significantly 
larger reduction (73% and 79%) in Ioff 
compared with increasing gate length 
(HVT(Lg')) and increasing channel  doping 
(HVT(Nch')) as shown in Fig. 17. This is 
because as drain-side underlap length (Lund) 
increases, the band-to-band tunneling width

UTB GeOI logic circuits and 6T SRAM

2. We have examined the advantages of 
using the InGaAs-OI(NFET)/GeOI(PFET) 
SRAM cells, and have proposed the 
optimized threshold-voltage (Vt) designs 
to enhance the variation immunity for 
high-performance and low-voltage 
applications, respectively [39].  
3. We have conducted a comparative 
leakage analysis of GeOI FinFET and Ge 
bulk FinFET at device and circuit levels, 
and have evaluated the effectiveness of 
various high Vt technology options for 
leakage reduction [40].  
 
Our study has provided detailed 
understanding of the advantages, constraints, 
trade-off and merits of hetero-channel devices 
for future logic/SRAM applications. Our 
research results have been reported at IEDM 
[26] and several IEEE journal papers [36-41] 
under this project. These research works have 
been crucial to the education of our graduate 
students to become leading researchers in the 
areas of silicon-based nanoelectronics, 
modeling and design for emerging CMOS 
devices, and circuit-device interaction and co-
optimization in nanoscale CMOS.

Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop (SNW), sponsored by the Japan Society of Applied 
Physics and the IEEE Electron Device Society, is a major international workshop in the 
area of silicon-related nanoelectronics aiming to bridge the gap between Si 
nanotechnology and the real VLSI world. The 2013 SNW, held in Kyoto from June 9-10, 
is the 18th in a series of annual workshops. SNW is also a satellite workshop of the VLSI 
symposia held from June 11-13 at the same location.  
This year, the technical program of SNW consisted of 9 sessions: [Session 1] Plenary & 
Nonvolatile Memories, [Session 2] Ge Channel MOSFET, [Session 3] Nanoscale FETs: 
Small & Low Power, [Session 4] Nanoscale FETs: Device Model & Variability, [Session 5] 
Posters, [Session 6] Nano Wire FETs & Formation, [Session 7] Single-Electron & Dopant 
Phenomena, [Session 8] Emerging Devices, and [Session 9] Rump Session. Our paper was 
presented in Session 5 on June 9. Before the start of the poster session, each paper was 
given 1 minute for a brief oral introduction/summary of the work. Our presentation went 
smoothly. Many people from Taiwan attended the conference, among them including Profs.

Although our National Science Council has provided opportunity for student travel 
support, it is sometimes too late (in schedule) for graduate students to apply for the travel 
support from NSC after knowing the acceptance of their papers. It would be good for 
students if NSC can somewhat relax the application schedule (e.g., 4 weeks before the 
conference) of the student travel support.

High-mobility channel materials (such as Ge and InGaAs) have been regarded as 
alternative channel materials of future CMOS. This work aims to conduct a 
comprehensive evaluation for CMOS logic circuits and SRAM using these 
hetero-channel devices. Advanced device structures such as ultra-thin-body (UTB) 
and FinFET devices are used in our assessment. In this project: 
1. We have conducted a comprehensive investigation and analysis of leakage-delay, 
stability and variability for UTB GeOI logic circuits and 6T SRAM cells with respect 
to the UTB SOI counterparts. 
2. We have examined the advantages of using the InGaAs-OI(NFET)/GeOI(PFET) SRAM 
cells, and have proposed the optimized threshold-voltage (Vt) designs to enhance 
the variation immunity for high-performance and low-voltage applications, 
respectively.  
3. We present a comparative leakage analysis of GeOI FinFET and Ge bulk FinFET 
at device and circuit levels, and evaluate the effectiveness of various high Vt 
technology options for leakage reduction. 
   Our research results have provided detailed understanding of the advantages,
