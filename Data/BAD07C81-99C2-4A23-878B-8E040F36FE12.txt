components was more than 60%. The embedded passive technology, which was to incorporate the 
passive components into one of the inner layers of multi-layer substrate, had been actively investigated 
[1]. Integration of passive components in a substrate had the benefits of better electrical performance, 
higher reliability, lower cost, and improved design options. For that, organic substrates with embedded 
devices were predicted to grow rapidly from 2005 to 2011 in the world market [2-3]. In the past, most 
researches were focused on embedded capacitors with various capacitance values and properties. The 
capacitance value of a material could be calculated from: 
C = εo εr A/ d       (1) 
Where εo and εr were the free space (or air) and relative permittivity, A was the electrode area, and d 
was the thickness. Increasing the electrode area was not a good method because this method obeyed the 
expectation of miniaturization. Developing a technology to combine of using a high dielectric constant 
material and decreasing the thickness of embedded devices was a better method to increase the 
capacitance of embedded capacitors. In the past, most high dielectric constant fillers were in the scale 
of micro-meter. In order to get the thinner dielectric layer, the particle sizes of fillers were hoped to be 
scaled down, for example in nano-scale. 
Polymer/ceramic composites were the promising materials used to develop the embedded passive 
components. BaTiO3, (Ba,Sr)TiO3, and Ba(Zr,Ti)O3 ceramics were well-known for their high dielectric 
constant (εr), and they had been applied to fabricate epoxy/ceramic composites [4]. The dielectric peaks 
of ferroelectric ceramic were existed at the Curie point, that would influence the stability of dielectric 
properties and the applications of polymer-ceramic composites. To improve this shortcoming, isovalent 
Sr+2 ions and aliovalent Zr+4 ions were used to substitute the Ba+2 and Ti+4 ions in BaTiO3 ceramic to 
form (Ba0.8Sr0.2)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BSTZ) composition [5]. The BSTZ ceramic had higher dielectric 
constant and a broader dielectric peak than BaTiO3 ceramic did [6]. From the descriptions, the 
influences of different contents and sizes of BSTZ ceramic powders were developed in this study. The 
polyetherimide (PEI) was used as the polymer because it had the characteristic of flexibility. To 
develop the embedded devices with thinner thickness and higher dielectric constant, high dielectric 
constant of BSTZ ceramic powder with different average particle sizes (3 µm, 200 nm, and 100 nm) 
were developed as the fillers to investigate PEI/BSTZ composites. The dielectric characteristics of 
PEI/BSTZ composites were measured from 10kHz to 1MHz using the plate method. The Lichtenecker 
logarithmic mixing rule was also used to predict the dielectric constants of PEI/BSTZ composites and 
critically decreases. As the content of dispersant is more than 0.4 wt%, the viscosity reveals a saturation 
value. For that, 0.6 wt% DK1 dispersant is used for the different shear rate with low viscosity. 
The XRD patterns of BSTZ ceramic powders are compared in Fig.3. Using 1450oC as the sintering 
temperature, no unknown or satellite phases are observed and the BSTZ ceramic shows a tetragonal 
structure. XRD patterns suggest that the BSTZ ceramic has the ferroelectric characteristics at room 
temperature. The results shown in the XRD patterns indicate that even with different particle sizes, all 
BSTZ ceramic powders have the similarly crystalline peaks. Comparing the (110) peak shown in Fig.3, 
the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of 3µm-BSTZ is smaller than those of 200nm-BSTZ 
and 100nm-BSTZ ceramic powders. As the particle sizes are decreased to nano-meter, the diffraction of 
X-ray happens, and then the FWHM values increase. As the average particle sizes decrease from 
200nm to 100nm, the diffraction effect is more apparent and the crystalline intensity of (001) peak 
critically decreases. 
The morphologies of the PEI/BSTZ composites mixing with different particle sizes and contents of 
BSTZ ceramic powders are also observed by SEM and the results are shown in Fig.4. If no dispersant 
is added or the amount of dispersant is less than 0.4wt%, the BSTZ ceramic powder will agglomerate. 
From the SEM images in Fig 4, the BSTZ powder is well dispersed in PEI as the 0.6 wt% KD1 
dispersant is added. As the contents of 200nm-BSTZ and 100nm-BSTZ are equal and more than 
50wt%, the BSTZ particles are observed. Because as the sizes of BSTZ ceramic powders decrease from 
3µm to the scale of nanometer, the surface area is critically increased and the PEI is not enough to 
cover the whole BSTZ powder, as Fig.4(f) and Fig.4(i) show.  
It is very important for real designs and applications if we can precisely predict the effective 
dielectric constants of developed polymer/ceramic composites. The Lichtenecker logarithmic mixing 
law is widely recognized for a composite with m components. The PEI/BSTZ composites are assumed 
as a randomly connected state, half is in parallel and half is in series, and the general equations form is 
[7]:

= ∑
                                             (2)  
and, a mixture of two components is 
 (VP+VC) log ε = VP log εP + VC log εC               (3) 
where VP=WP/DP and VC=WC/DC are the volume fraction of polymer and ceramics, and εP and εC 
represent the dielectric constants of polymer and ceramics, respectively, and VP+VC=1. 
loss tangents for PEI/3µm-BSTZ composites are small than those of PEI/200nm-BSTZ and 
PEI/100nm-BSTZ composites. For example, as the 70wt% ceramic powder is used as the filling 
content, the loss tangents of PEI/3µm-BSTZ, PEI/200nm-BSTZ, and PEI/100nm-BSTZ composites are 
increased from 0.023 to 0.028, from 0.019 to 0.027, and from 0.015 to 0.024, respectively, as the 
measured frequency increases from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The reason is that as the contents of 
200nm-BSTZ and 100nm-BSTZ ceramic powders are more than 50wt%, the PEI is not enough to cover 
over the whole particles of nano-scale BSTZ ceramic powders. As Fig.4(f) and Fig.4(i) show, some 
pores exist in the PEI/BSTZ composites as nano-scale BSTZ ceramic powders are used as the fillers. 
However, even the 200nm-BSTZ and 100nm-BSTZ ceramic powders are used as filler and the content 
is more than 50wt%, the loss tangents of all PEI/BSTZ composites developed in this study are less than 
3%. As the ferroelectric ceramic of BSTZ ceramic powders mixing with the nonpolarizable material of 
PEI to form PEI/BSTZ composites, fewer ionic dipoles are available to form switchable dipoles. For 
that, the dielectric constants and loss tangents of PEI/BSTZ composites are almost unchanged as the 
measured frequency from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The PEI/BSTZ composites fabricated in this study have 
good dielectric characteristics, and the PEI/BSTZ composites show less pores as compared to other 
literatures. Because the nano-scale ceramic powders can be well mixed with PEI, for that we can 
develop the PEI/BSTZ composites with thinner thickness in the future. 
 
Conclusions 
The contents of (Ba0.9Sr0.1)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BSTZ) ceramic powders to be uniformly dispersed in PEI 
are dependent on the particle sizes. As the contents of BSTZ ceramic powders increase from 10 wt% to 
70 wt% and the measured frequencies increase from 10 kHz to 1 MHz, the dielectric constants and loss 
tangents of all PEI/BSTZ composites increase, independent on the particle sizes. As the BSTZ contents 
are less than and equal to 50 wt%, the dielectric constants of PEI/200nm-BSTZ and PEI/100nm-BSTZ 
composites are larger than those of PEI/3µm-BSTZ composites. Even the 200nm-BSTZ and 
100nm-BSTZ ceramic particles are used as the fillers, the Lichtenecker equation is useful to predict the 
dielectric constants of PEI/BSTZ composites. The fabricated PEI/BSTZ composites have good 
dielectric characteristics and all loss tangents of PEI/BSTZ composites are less than 3%. These results 
suggest that the PEI/200nm-BSTZ and PEI/100nm-BSTZ composites can be a good candidate to 
develop the thinner embedded capacitor devices with high capacitance value in the future.
