will be referred to as “subsurface”.  The alloys 
were polished with no. 2000 sandpaper and 0.3 
µm Al2O3 powders (99.9 % C2H5OH solution was 
used). The microstructures of the alloys were 
determined using an image analyzer.  In 
addition, both XPS and thin-film XRD were used 
to obtain data of the surface and the subsurface.  
For thin-film XRD analysis, the Cu-Kα standard 
(λ=1.5403nm) was selected for X-ray diffraction.  
The scanning angle was varied from 20o to 90o 
and the scanning velocity was 3o · min -1.  
Furthermore, the thin film of the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu 
alloy was examined by transmission electron 
microscopic (TEM) observation and selected 
area diffraction (SAD) analysis.  The structure 
of the affected region was observed by a TEM 
(JEOL-JEM-3010) operating at was 200 Kv.    
In order to compare the experimental results, 
solidification thin film data of the pure tin and 
Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu specimens was also gathered 
using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  
For SIMS analysis (CAMECA-NanoSIMS 50), 
the primary ion source was Cs+ with 5 KeV and 
the dimensions of the square specimen were 8 
mm × 8 mm × 2 mm.  Each analysis datum 
was the average of 3~4 test results. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
Fig. 1 shows the different microstructures of 
the Sn-3.5Ag and the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu alloy.  A 
previous study of the Sn-3.5Ag-xCu (x=0~2.0 wt.%) 
alloy and reference [3] revealed that Cu6Sn5 
compounds and the area fraction of eutectic 
phases increased, and the shape of β-Sn phase 
transformed from dendrite into dispersed with 
increasing the Cu content. The overcooling 
gradient increased with increasing the Cu content 
and this was the main reason for the structural 
variations in the solders.  In addition, dendritic 
β-Sn phase and eutectic phase (β-Sn and Ag3Sn) 
were also observed in the Sn-3.5Ag alloy (see Fig. 
1(a)).  In Fig.1 (b), a large number of precipitated 
Cu6Sn5 can be seen mostly in beta-Sn phase and 
a very small number of Cu6Sn5 precipitated 
around beta-Sn grain boundaries.   This finding 
does not tally with that of the relevant study [9]. 
In this work, to begin with, Cu and Sn melt reacted 
to form precipitated Cu6Sn5 dispersed in the matrix.  
Then, beta-Sn solidified.  Finally, eutectic phases 
solidified.  Ag3Sn phase is not observed in either 
Fig. 1(a) or Fig.1 (b).  In order to examine the 
difference in composition between the surface and 
the subsurface, thin-film XRD analysis of the 
Sn-3.5Ag and the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu alloy was 
performed. 
Fig. 2 (a) shows the thin-film X-ray diffractive 
patterns of the Sn-3.5Ag alloy.  It can be seen 
that both β-Sn phase and Ag3Sn phase existed in 
the surface and the subsurface.  As for the 
relative composition, the content of Ag3Sn phase 
was lower in the surface than in the subsurface.  
To compare the data, thin-film XRD analysis of the 
Sn-3.5Ag-2Cu alloy was also performed (see Fig. 
2 (b)).  Results show that the composition of both 
the surface and the subsurface were similar.  In 
addition to β-Sn phase, Ag3Sn compounds and 
Cu6Sn5 compounds also formed, and the content 
of the latter two compounds had a tendency to 
increase from the surface to the subsurface.  The 
solidification surface thin films of both the 
Sn-3.5Ag specimen and Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu 
specimen exhibited discoloring, but neither Fig. 2 
(a) nor Fig. 2 (b) can explain the mechanisms of 
the solidification surface film completely.  With an 
aim to understand the solidification thin film 
characteristics, XPS was performed at the surface 
and the subsurface.           
 Fig. 3 shows the full XPS spectra of both the 
Sn-3.5Ag specimen and the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu 
specimen.  Fig. 3 reveals differences between 
the surface and the subsurface.  In Fig. 3(a), 
comparing the surface with the subsurface, a large 
amount of Sn / SnOx (Sn3s1; Sn3p3) was found at 
the subsurface.  For the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu alloy 
(see Fig. 3(b)), the subsurface also contained a 
larger amount of Sn / SnOx (Sn3s1; Sn3p3) than 
the surface.  According to the above findings and 
relevant references [10-11], the full XPS spectra 
can’t distinguish between Sn and SnOx phase.  
Moreover, the concentration of every element in 
the experimental specimens was also analyzed by 
the curve-fitting figures of XPS analysis to explain 
the thin film characteristics.                 
The curve-fitting figures of XPS-Sn analysis 
on the Sn-3.5Ag alloy and the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu 
alloy are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 [10-11].  In 
Fig.4 (Sn-3.5Ag), the single peak curves of the 
surface and the double peak curves of the 
subsurface are composed of three curves: Sn, 
Sn2+ and Sn4+ curves.  As for relative composition, 
the Sn content of the subsurface was higher than 
the surface, and both the Sn2+ and Sn4+ content 
were lower at the subsurface.  A similar 
phenomenon also occurred in the Sn-3.5Ag-2.0Cu 
specimen (see Fig. 5).  These results indicate 
that the oxidative effect was lower at the 
subsurface.  Notably, Sn2+ and Sn4+ spectra are 
still observed at the subsurface of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.  
The evidence shows that tin alloys are highly 
susceptible to oxidation in air.  Comparing Fig. 4 
with Fig. 5, Sn2+ of the Sn-3.5Ag specimen 
diffused more easily from the subsurface to the 
surface.  This can explained by increasing Cu 
repressing the diffusion of Sn2+ in the Sn-3.5Ag 
specimen (interstitial diffusion was lower [12-13]).  
In the copper-free solidification process, the 
kinetics energy of Sn2+ was greater than that of 
Sn4+ (the standard kinetic energy of Sn4+ and Sn2+ 
are 486.3 eV and 485.4 eV).
