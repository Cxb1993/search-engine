Abstract
This final report summarizes all of the results of the 3-year project. This report is divided 
into two parts : effect of carbon incorporation techniques on the NiSi/Si structure and 
gate-all-around (GAA) poly-Si thin film transistor(TFT) technology. 
In the part of carbon incorporation, plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), 
conventional ion implantation, and low energy/low temperature ion implantation techniques 
were employed. Carbon film may be deposited on sample surface as the PIII energy is too low. 
In this case, the Ni/Si interaction will be blocked. All of the three techniques can raise the 
thermal stability of NiSi/Si by 50-100!C as the carbon dose is higher than 1x10
15
 cm
-2
.
However, with the high dose As, P, or B, this benefit disappears. The low energy ion 
implantation technique produces the highest quality surface amorphous layer among the three 
techniques. Low energy carbon ion implantation integrating with suitable rapid thermal 
annealing and laser annealing can obtain substitutional carbon concentration as high as 1.1%. 
This value is useful for strained Si application. Unfortunately, high dose carbon implantation 
produces many defects in Si substrate. These defects can not be fully removed after high 
temperature annealing. Ni atom may diffuse quickly via these defects and may results in 
higher p-n junction leakage current. The distribution of carbon and the junction depth should 
be designed carefully. High dose carbon incorporation may reduce the Schottky barrier height 
by 30meV on n-Si, which implies that the contact resistance will not be affected by carbon 
incorporation.
In the part of GAA TFT technology, e-beam lithography, photo-resist trimming, and 
plasma etching processes were developed to fabricate TFTs with channel length and channel 
with smaller than 30nm. Due to the 8-nm-thick ultra-thin active layer and the GAA gate 
structure, fully-depleted channel and good short channel effect is obtained. Integrating with 
the modified Schottky barrier source/drain junction, the record small TFT with 18-nm gate 
length is demonstrated. Using high dielectric constant dielectric to replace the SiO2 gate 
dielectric, the record high driving current of 500  A/ m is obtained. This driving capability is 
close to the conventional nMOSFET. 
In the past three years, 3 Ph.D students and 6 graduate students involved this project. 
Among them, 2 of the 3 Ph.D student and 4 of the 6 graduate students have received their 
Ph.D and MS degrees, respectively. The other one Ph.D student is expected to receive his Ph. 
D degree in one year. Three undergraduate students have entered the MS program. Parts of the 
results have been published as 2 SCI journal papers and 5 conference papers. One SCI journal

do low energy ion implantation, it can be used on ultra-shallow junction fabrication. In the 
research of C.A. Pico et al., PMOS is successfully fabricated by using BPIII process [11]. PIII 
is also used on sidewall doping of trench structure [12]. Since PIII has immersion type doping 
characteristic, the sidewall doping of high aspect ratio trench structure is easier by using PIII. 
Nitrogen PIII can use on suppressing thermal hillock formation in aluminum metallization 
[13], or improve the electrical characteristics of high-k gated MOS devices [14]. 
    In this chapter, we use PIII as carbon ion implantation source. First, we discuss the basic 
characteristic of the CPIII silicon substrate. Then the thermal stability improvement of CPIII 
on the NiSi/Si structure is discussed, both without As doping and with As doping samples are 
included. 
 
1.2 Experimental Procedure 
A. Carbon Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation (CPIII) 
    The PIII system used in this project consists of process chamberĭġelectrical power system, 
vacuum system, and gas providing system. Fig.1-2 shows the whole PIII equipment. The 
process chamber is a chamber with sample chuck at the bottom and an antenna to light the 
plasma on. A valve control panel is linked to the chamber to control all the valves linked to 
the process chamber. Fig.1-3 shows the control panel of the valves. Fig.1-4 and Fig.1-5 show 
the electrical power system, it includes a DC power supply and a DC pulse signal source. The 
vacuum system includes two pumps and one pressure meter. One pump is for the first step 
vacuum to make the pressure down from air pressure, the other pump is a turbo pump which 
can make the chamber pressure down to 10
-6
 torr. The gas providing system includes CH4 gas 
source and a gas flow meter.  
    At the beginning of the process, we put the wafer on the sample chuck. Then we use the 
vacuum system to make the chamber pressure down to 10
-5
 torr. After the process pressure 
reached, CH4 gas is pour into the process chamber with a flow rate of 50 sccm. DC power 
supply is turned on to light on the plasma with a value of 150V. In the final step, DC pulse 
signal is applied to the chuck and the carbon ions are implanted into the silicon substrate, the 
process pressure is about 1.2 ǘġ 10-3 torr. 
 
B. Sample Preparation 
    Six-inch-diameter p-type (100) silicon wafers with nominal resistivity of 15~25  -cm 
were used as substrates. The PIII was performed at 3 keV and 5 keV, and the implantation 
4 
CPIII sample, we can see that there is a 32nm thick amorphous layer on the surface of silicon 
substrate. 
Since too many carbon implanted into silicon will deactivate other dopants and increase 
the interface contact resistance [15]. The suitable carbon dose in the silicon substrate should 
be between 1×10
15
 cm
-2
 and 1×10
16
 cm
-2
. Base on all the experimental data, the carbon 
implantation time will be controlled less than 5 minutes in the following experiments, which 
is expected to produce better experimental results. 
 
1.4 Impact of CPIII on NiSi/Si Structure  
In this section, thermal stability of the NiSi/Si structure after performing carbon PIII 
process is examined. First, the thermal stability of the pure NiSi/Si structure is discussed and 
used as reference, then the thermal stability of the carbon PIII NiSi/Si structure is discussed. 
Both NiSi/Si structure with N
+
 doping and without N
+
 doing are included. 
 
A. Pure NiSi/Si Structure 
From the sheet resistance value of the samples shown in Fig.1-9, the resistance value of 
NiSi is very stable when the annealing temperature is lower than 700 C. This indicates that 
agglomeration and phase transformation do not occur when the annealing temperature is not 
higher than 700 C. From the SEM images in Fig.1-10(a) ~Fig.1-10(c), it is also found that the 
surface of the sample is smooth when the annealing temperature is not higher than 700 C. 
This indicates that agglomeration does not occur. As the annealing temperature increases to 
800 C, the sheet resistance increases obviously. This result indicates that agglomeration 
and/or phase transformation occurs. From the SEM image shown in Fig.3-10(d), it is observed 
that the nickel silicide surface agglomerates and some holes appear. From the XRD spectra 
shown in Fig.3-11, it is observed that the phase of nickel silicide transforms from NiSi to 
NiSi2 when the annealing temperature increases to 900 C. Fig.3-10(e) shows that the 
agglomeration is very sever, there is no continuous nickel silicide film on the surface. 
In summary, pure NiSi can form stable nickel silicide thin film when the annealing 
temperature is not higher than 700 C. Agglomeration and phase transformation occur at 
temperatures higher than 800 C. 
     
B. CPIII NiSi/Si Structure without Arsenic Doping 
Fig.1-12 shows the sheet resistance values of the 3K1M and 5K1M CPIII samples after 
6 
partly agglomerates before phase transformation, so the sheet resistance is high. When the 
annealing temperature increases to 900 C, the phase transformation speed is higher. NiSi 
phase can transform to NiSi2 phase before severe agglomeration occurs, so the extent of 
agglomeration is slighter than that on the 800ʚ annealed sample, and the sheet resistance is 
lower. The SEM micrographs shown in Fig.1-18 proofs the agglomeration on the 800 C 
annealed sample is more severe than that on the 900 C annealed sample. This observation 
confirms previous hypothesis. 
 The sheet resistance results of the 5K1M CPIII sample are similar to the results of the 
3K1M CPIII sample. That means the agglomeration and phase transform on the samples are 
similar. The surface morphology of the 3K1M and 5K1M CPIII samples inspected by SEM 
are shown in Fig.1-18 and Fig.1-19, respectively. It is observed that both 3K1M and 5K1M 
samples has very smooth surface without agglomeration when the annealing temperature is 
500 C and 600 C. This observation matches with the sheet resistance results. As the 
annealing temperature increases to 700 C, both 3K1M and 5K1M samples reveal pin holes on 
part of the surface. Since most part of the surface is still continuous, the sheet resistance does 
not change significantly. From the SEM micrographs shown in Fig.1-18 and Fig.1-19, the 
surface morphologies of the 3K1M and 5K1M samples are very similar at every annealing 
temperatures, this result is consistent with the sheet resistance result. 
    The sheet resistance values of the 3K5M and 5K5M PIII samples are very different from 
the 1 minute CPIII samples. When the annealing temperature is 500ʚ and 600ʚ, the sheet 
resistance values of both 3K5M and 5K5M samples are between 160  /  and 200  / . The 
surface morphologies of both samples are shown in Fig.1-20 and Fig.1-21. It is observed that 
the surface of both samples were smooth, which implies that the high sheet resistance value is 
not due to agglomeration. The XRD analysis reveals that there’s no nickel silicide formed on 
sample surface when the annealing temperature is 500 C and 600 C, as shown in Fig.1-22. As 
the annealing temperature increases to 700 C, NiSi2 forms so the sheet resistance decreases. 
However, the SEM images shown in Fig.1-20 and Fig.1-21 show that the silicide film 
significantly agglomerates when the annealing temperature increases to 700 C, so the sheet 
resistance is still around 130 / . In the 800 C annealing case, the agglomeration is severer, 
so the sheet resistance further increases. When the annealing temperature increases to 900 C, 
because the phase transform speed increases as mentioned before, the agglomeration is 
slighter than the 800ʚ annealed sample, so the sheet resistance is lower. 
    The experimental results of the CPIII NiSi/Si structure are summarized as follows. In the 
8 
1.5 Conclusions  
 Carbon plasma immersion ion implantation can implant large amount of carbon into 
silicon substrate in a short time. The SIMS depth profile indicates that the effective dose after 
15minutes CPIII process can achieve 1.52×10
18
 cm
-2
 and most of the implanted carbons are 
located in the top 50 nm from the surface of the substrate. From the TEM image we can find 
there’s no evident amorphous layer on the surface. We perform CPIII on N
+
P junction 
structure at energy 3keVˣ5keV for 1minuteˣ5minutes, and we find the CPIII process would 
not increase junction leakage because implanted carbon can repair the secondary defects 
caused by ion implantation by capturing Si interstitials, and further reduce the leakage current 
brought by secondary defects. As CPIII applied to NiSi/Si structure without arsenic doping, 
we find 5K1M CPIII process can improve the agglomeration temperature to 800ɗ. In the 
case of arsenic doped NiSi/Si structure, we find CPIII could not increase NiSi thermal 
stability because arsenic atom will change the interfacial energy between nickel silicide and 
silicon.

Effect of Carbon Ion Implantation on the Thermal 
Stability of Nickel Silicide Film 
2.1 Introduction 
 NiSi has been used as source/drain (S/D) contact material of sub-100 nm MOSFETs 
technology because of its several advantages including low resistivity, low contact resistivity, 
low temperature process, less Si consumption during silicide formation, and no narrow line 
effect and bridging failure [1]. For further scale-down, one of the main issues of NiSi is its 
poor thermal stability. It has been known that NiSi film agglomerates at 700 °C and 
transforms into NiSi2 at 750 °C. These factors result in an increasing sheet resistance of nickel 
silicide and poor morphology, and then degrade device performance. Consequently, raising 
the thermal stability of NiSi is very important. Many different solutions have been proposed 
by several authors to improve the thermal stability of nickel silicide. These solutions involve 
the ion implantation utilizing F or N2 ions before NiSi formation, Ti or Pt deposition as a 
capping layer or a interposing layer, and Ni1-xTix or Ni1-xPtx alloy [2-7]. 
 Recently, S. Zaima et al. reported that Ni film on p
+
 Si0.996C0.004 epitaxial layer grown by 
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) can suppress NiSi agglomeration 
effectively after annealing at 750 °C and retard its phase transformation until the annealing at 
850 °C [8]. This result indicates that adding carbon (C) atoms in Si substrate is a feasible 
method to enhance the thermal stability of NiSi. Since the solid solubility of carbon in Si and 
NiSi is very low [9], carbon atoms segregate to the NiSi grain boundary and NiSi/Si interfaces 
and modify grain boundary and interfacial energy to suppress agglomeration and phase 
transformation [10]. However, when adopting selectively embedded S/D process of 
MOSFETs in order to produce strained Si channel, it is difficult to grow Si1-xCx with 
substitutional C concentration exceeding 1 % (x>1 %) due to extremely low solid solubility of 
C in Si. 
 In this chapter we introduce the ion implantation method with C ions into Si substrate so 
that high substitutional C concentration can be achieved, and this process is an easier than 
epitaxy process and can be integrated with conventional CMOS process flow. The correlation 
between the C dose of the ion implantation and the NiSi thermal stability is also discussed. 
30 
As the C
+
 implantation dose increases up to 5x10
15
 cm
-2
, the Rs values are stable without 
increasing until 850 °C. For the CIA samples with C+ implantation to 5x10
15
 cm
-2
 at 30 keV, 
the Rs values increase slightly at 850 °C, but for the reference samples, the Rs values increase 
greatly at 850 °C due to serious agglomeration. Hence the function of carbon atoms within 
nickel silicide is suppressing agglomeration. For the CIA samples with C
+
 implantation to 
5x10
15
 cm
-2
 at 40 keV, the Rs values are unchanged even at 850 °C. According to the XRD 
result as shown in Fig.4, no phase transformation occurs, and the NiSi film is still continuous 
without agglomerating after 850 °C annealing as shown in the plane-view SEM micrographs 
of Fig.5. 
Fig.6 shows the measured Rs values of w/o CIA samples and the reference sample as a 
function of annealing temperature for 30sec. For the w/o CIA samples with a dose of 1x10
15
 
cm
-2
, lightly agglomeration and phase transformation (not shown) take place at 800 °C as the 
same as the CIA samples with the same dose. When C+ implantation dose increases to 5x10
15
 
cm
-2
, as comparing between Fig.1 and Fig.6, the temperature dependence of the Rs value of 
the w/o CIA samples is more apparent than that of the CIA samples. We speculate that the 
grain size variation dominates this phenomenon. Because the Si surface was amorphorized by 
the high dose C
+
 implantation, the poly-NiSi grain size of the w/o CIA samples is lager and 
the Rs value is lower with the increase of temperature during nickel silicide formation. For the 
w/o CIA samples with a dose of 5x10
15
 cm
-2
, grain growth effect dominates Rs value at the 
temperature range of 500~800 °C as shown in Fig.6. On the contrary, phase transformation 
and agglomeration dominate Rs value at 850 °C as shown in Fig.7~8, so that the Rs values 
increase at 850 °C. 
Table 2-1 summarize the phase transforming and agglomerating temperature of all 
samples. It is clear that carbon ion implantation with a dose of 1x10
15
 cm
-2
 can raise the 
agglomeration and phase transformation temperature of nickel silicide to 800 °C. Increasing 
carbon dose to 5x10
15
 cm
-2
, it is able to further raise the agglomeration and phase 
transformation temperature of nickel silicide to 850 °C. 
 
2.4 Conclusions 
 We have investigated the impact of carbon ion implantation on the thermal stability of 
nickel silicide. Although carbon atoms exist within nickel silicide, may increase the sheet 
resistance at low silicide-formation temperature (ɩ700  C) due to C segregation at grain 
boundary, the increased sheet resistance value is only slightly larger than that of the reference

Impact of Carbon Ion Implantation on the Thermal 
Stability of Nickel Silicide Contacted Shallow Junction 
3.1 Introduction 
 Nickel monosilicide (NiSi) has been extensively investigated and used as a source/drain 
(S/D) contact material for a long time. NiSi has several advantages including low resistivity, 
low contact resistivity, a low-temperature process, less Si consumption during silicide 
formation, no narrow-line effect, and no bridging failure [1]. However, the main issue of NiSi 
film is its thermal stability at high temperatures. It is well known that NiSi film agglomerates 
to form small broken holes and then discontinuous islands at 700 °C, and the NiSi phase 
transforms into NiSi2 phase at 700-750 °C. These two factors cause an increase in the sheet 
resistance (Rs) of the Ni-silicide film. Moreover, with the continuous scaling down of 
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices, ultra shallow S/D junctions are 
becoming increasingly important in order to suppress the short-channel effect (SCE). The 
decrease in junction depth requires a decrease in NiSi film thickness, which has a strong 
effect on its thermal stability. Consequently, several methods of raising the thermal stability 
of NiSi film have been published [2-7]. These methods involve ion implantation (I/I) utilizing 
F or N2 ions before NiSi formation, the deposition of Ti or Pt as a capping layer or an 
interposing layer, and the deposition of a Ni1-xTix or Ni1-xPtx alloy. 
Recently, Zaima et al. reported that a p

 Si0.996C0.004 epitaxial layer grown by 
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) can effectively raise the thermal stability 
of NiSi film [8], and similar results were also reported by Nakatsuka et al. [9]. The 
mechanism of suppressing the agglomeration and phase transformation of NiSi film is that C 
atoms segregate to the NiSi grain boundaries and NiSi/Si interface to modify the grain 
boundary and interfacial energy due to the low solid solubility of C atoms in NiSi [10].  Two 
common methods have been used to include C atoms within a Si substrate. One is Si1-xCx 
epitaxial growth directly on a Si substrate [8, 10], and the other is C I/I into a Si wafer surface 
followed by thermal annealing [9, 11-12]. As a result of the extremely low solid solubility of 
C atoms in Si, the Si1-xCx epitaxial process cannot easily achieve a higher substitutional C 
concentration than 1% (x>1%) [13]. In this chapter, we focus on C I/I technology. This

samples with blanket Ni-silicide films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was adopted to distinguish 
the NiSi phase from the NiSi2 phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to 
inspect the surface morphology of the Ni-silicide. The I-V characteristics of the n
+
/p shallow 
junctions were measured by an Agilent 4156C precision semiconductor parameter analyzer. 
 
3.3 Results and Discussion 
A. Thermal stability 
 Figure 2 shows the measured Rs values as a function of silicide formation temperature 
with As I/I energy at 35 keV. The samples with the higher C I/I dose of 5x10
15
 cm
-2
 (C5As35) 
have slightly higher Rs values at a lower silicide formation temperature (ɩ700 °C) due to the 
larger number of C atoms within the Ni-silicide film. Figures 3-5 display SEM images of the 
C0As35, C1As35, and C5As35 samples, respectively. The Rs values of the C0As35 samples 
increase from 700 °C because of NiSi film agglomeration. Many broken holes in the NiSi film 
can be seen in Fig. 3(b). On the other hand, few holes can be observed at 750 °C in the 
C1As35 samples, as shown in Fig. 4(c), and a continuous Ni-silicide film without any holes is 
obtained even at 800 °C in the C5As35 samples as shown in Fig. 5(d). Hence, it is confirmed 
that sufficient C atoms can effectively suppress the agglomeration of Ni-silicide film. 
To understand the reason for the increased Rs values of the C1As35 samples at 750 °C 
and the C5As35 samples at 800 °C, XRD analysis was used to identify the Ni-silicide phase. 
The XRD spectra of C1As35 and C5As35 samples are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), 
respectively. In Fig. 6(a), it is observed that the NiSi2(400) phase appears at 750 °C in the 
C1As35 samples, and the NiSi(121) phase coexists in the Ni-silicide film at the same time. 
Furthermore, the NiSi(121) phase disappears and only the NiSi2(400) phase can be detected at 
800 °C. In the C5As35 samples, the NiSi2(400) phase does not occur until 800 °C as shown in 
Fig. 6(b). According to these observations, it is clear that increasing the C I/I dose to 5x10
15
 
cm
-2
 can retard the phase transformation of NiSi film. In summary, performing the C I/I 
process with a higher C dose of 5x10
15
 cm
-2
 is a feasible method for enhancing the thermal 
stability of NiSi film even if As dopants exist. 
Figure 7 shows the measured Rs values as a function of silicide formation temperature 
with As I/I energy at 85 keV, and the corresponding SEM images and XRD spectra are shown 
in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The information revealed from these figures is similar to that 
discussed previously. Moreover, the phase transformation temperature of the C0As85 samples 
is 750 °C while that of the C0As35 samples is 700 °C. On the basis of the experimental 
46 
produced by the high-dose I/I process form the diffusion path. Ni atoms can rapidly diffuse 
via these defects during silicide formation. As Ni atoms diffuse toward the junction depletion 
region and form deep levels, the junction leakage current increases. The third is the phase 
transformation from the NiSi phase to the NiSi2 phase. When the phase transformation occurs, 
the thickness of the silicide film becomes double that of the NiSi film. Thus, the Ni-silicide/Si 
interface becomes closer to the junction depletion region. Agglomeration can easily damage 
the junction depletion region, and more Ni atoms arrive at the junction depletion region to 
contribute to the junction leakage current. Agglomeration and the phase transformation occur 
at a high silicide formation temperature and depend on the silicide formation temperature and 
C I/I dose. In addition to the silicide formation temperature, the effect of the diffusion of Ni 
atoms is also related to the number of I/I defects, which depends on the C I/I dose. 
For the reasons mentioned above, the deeper junction has fewer Ni atoms within the 
junction depletion region. Moreover, the agglomeration and phase transformation also have 
less impact on the deeper junction. Hence, by comparing Figs. 11 and 12, it can be seen that 
the leakage current at an As I/I energy of 85 keV is much lower than that of 35 keV at a high 
silicide formation temperature. 
When the C I/I dose is zero or equal to 1x10
15
 cm
-2
, the number of defects is not large 
enough to form a long diffusion path for Ni atoms. Hence, the agglomeration and phase 
transformation dominate the junction leakage current mechanism, and the junction leakage 
current increases with silicide formation temperature. Because the C1As35 and C1As85 
samples have better thermal stability of the Ni-silicide film, both samples exhibit a lower 
leakage current than the C0As35 and C0As85 samples with silicide formation temperatures of 
700 and 750  C .  
On the other hand, when the C I/I dose increases to 5x10
15
 cm
-2
, it generates many 
remnant defects, and Ni atoms can diffuse very rapidly via these defects. Therefore, the 
diffusion of Ni atoms dominates the junction leakage current mechanism. The leakage 
currents of the C5As35 and C5As85 samples are similar to that of the C0As35 sample at 500 
 C, as can be observed by comparing Figs. 11 and 12. This indicates that most of the defects 
generated by a high C I/I dose were annihilated by RTA at 1100  C for 30 s. Figures 13(a) 
and 13(b) show the SIMS depth profiles of C, As, and Ni atoms of the C5As85 and C0As85 
samples with the silicide formation temperature at 600  C, respectively. The different surface 
NiSi thicknesses of these two samples is due to the thickness variation of the as-deposited Ni 
films. Hence, all of the depth profiles were measured from the NiSi/Si interface, which is 
48 
3.4 Conclusions 
 We have investigated the impact of carbon ion implantation on the thermal stability of 
nickel silicide. Although carbon atoms exist within nickel silicide, may increase the sheet 
resistance at low silicide- ʀformation temperature ( 700 °C) due to C segregation at grain 
boundary, the increased sheet resistance value is only slightly larger than that of the reference 
sample without C
+
 implantation. For the CIA samples, the increased of sheet resistance value 
is smaller than 1  /!. Sufficient carbon atoms, a dose of 5x10
15
 cm
-2
, can effectively suppress 
the agglomeration and phase transformation. For the CIA samples with a dose of 5x10
15
 cm
-2
 
at 40 keV, agglomeration and phase transformation indeed can be suppressed completely even 
at 850 °C. Hence as the silicide-formation temperature exceeds 700 °C, samples with C
+
 
implantation have lower Rs values than the reference samples. The thermal stability of nickel 
silicide can be improved by as high as 150 °C with the optimum C
+
 implantation condition of 
5x10
15
 cm
-2
 at 40 keV.

Low temperature e-chuck can lower the temperature of wafer, and can provide several process 
benefits. 
 
B. Substitutional Carbon Density Sample  
    Six-inch-diameter p-type (100) silicon wafers with nominal resistivity of 15~25  -cm 
were used as substrates. The low temperature ion implantation was performed at chuck 
temperature of 5 C or -15 C. The implant energy is at 3 keV, 5 keV, 7 keV, and 9 keV. The 
implantation dose is controlled toġ2~5×1015 cm-2. The implantation conditions of samples are 
labeled in the form of energy/dose. For the samples implanted at 5ɗ chuck temperature the 
implantation conditions are 3 keV/5×10
15
 cm
-2ˣ5 keV/5×1015 cm-2 and 7 keV/5×1015 cm-2. 
For the samples implanted at -15 C chuck temperature, the implantation conditions are 7 
keV/5×10
15
 cm
-2ˣ7 keV/8×1015 cm-2ˣ9 keV/5×1015 cm-2 and 3 keV/2×1015 cm-2+ 5 
keV/3×10
15
 cm
-2
+ 7 keV/3×10
15
 cm
-2
. Then all the samples accepted additional phosphorous 
ion implantation at 17 keV to a dose of 5×10
15
 cm
-2
. After phosphorus ion implantation, the 
samples were cut into small pieces and two steps of annealing process were performed for 
SiC formation. In the first step, samples were annealed in N2 ambient by a rapid thermal 
annealing (RTA) system at temperatures ranging from 650  C to 850  C for 90 to 180 secs. In 
the second step, some of the samples were annealed in N2 ambient by a RTA system at 
temperature of 1000 C for 1sec second. Some samples were annealed by a pulse laser 
annealing (PLA) system. A 248nm KrF excimer laser was used as laser source, the laser 
energy is 350 mJ/cm
2
, the pulse duration is around 25 ns/shot and the number of shots ranges 
from 5 to 20. 
    The same process steps were also performed on the CPIII samples to evaluate the 
substitutional carbon density of the CPIII process. The carbon ion implant condition is 3K5M 
and the annealing temperature is 650 C and 750 C for 120 secs. 
C. Material Analysis
    Several Material Analysis techniques include XRDǵSEMǵSIMS and TEM were used in 
our experiment. XRD analysis has two main purposes in this experiment. The first one is to 
find out the nickel silicide phase transformation temperature. The second purpose of XRD is 
to calculate the number of substitutional carbon by using the rocking curve method proposed 
by P. C. Kelires in 1997 [1]. This model can calculate the atomic percentage of the 
66 
decreases and the concentrations of phosphorous in the region between 16nm to 24nm and 
between 44nm to 48nm increases evidently. In the deeper region of the silicon substrate, the 
number of phosphorous increased for less than one order. 
The change of depth profiles indicates that phosphorous atoms diffuse from the original 
location toward the shallower region of the silicon substrate. The concentration of 
phosphorous in the tail region didn’t increase significantly, which means the phosphorous 
diffusion to the substrate is not affected by carbon. B. J. Pawlak et al. reported that the 
implanted carbon in the silicon substrate can catch Sii (interstitial silicon) to form Si-C cluster 
and reduce the number of Sii [2]. As the number of Sii decreases, the interstitial assisted 
transient enhanced diffusion (TED) will be suppressed and the depth of dopant diffused to the 
substrate will be reduced. We can also find that the concentration of phosphorous in the 
original carbon rich region significantly decreases after annealing, and the phosphorous 
distribution is shallower than the as-implanted distribution. This observation can be explained 
by a model which is similar to that proposed by B. J. Pawlak. In typical case, the Sii 
distributed near the Si surface will diffuse toward to Si surface because the free Si surface acts 
efficient Sii sink, while the Sii distributed deeper than the project range (Rp) of the implanted 
ions will diffuse toward the Si substrate because of the concentration gradient. With carbon 
ion implantation, some of the Sii in the carbon rich region tends to diffuse toward the bulk 
will be caught by carbon. The Sii assisted TED on phosphorus would be suppressed. 
Therefore, the depth of phosphorus becomes shallower. In the region between Si surface and 
the Rp of phosphorus, the concentration of Sii does not affected by carbon effectively. The 
upward diffused Si stream results in the increase of phosphorus near Si surface. This 
characteristic might be applied to ultra shallow junction fabrication, is one of the benefit of 
carbon ion implantation process. 
Fig.4-4 shows the TEM image of 7 keV/5×10
15
 cm
-2
 low temperature (5 C) carbon 
implanted sample. We can observe that the surface amorphous layer thickness is about 49nm 
to 50nm and is near totally amorphous. The boundary of amorphous layer and silicon 
substrate is clear but not very smooth. Fig-4.5 is the TEM image of 7 keV/5×10
15
 cm
-2
 low 
temperature (-15 C) carbon implanted sample. We can find its amorphous layer thickness is 
49 nm to 50 nm which is very similar to the 5 C implanted sample. The amorphous layer is 
totally amorphous, and the boundary of amorphous layer and silicon substrate is complete and 
smooth, it means the level of amorphous is higher than the amorphous layer of 5 C implanted 
sample but the difference is not very significant. The TEM image of 7 keV/5×10
15
 cm
-2
 low 
68 
percentage of the Csub (substitutional carbon) is only 0.501% at 3 keV and as the energy 
increases to 5 keV, the Csub increases to 0.743%. The Csub increases to 0.973% as the 
implantation energy further increases to 7 keV. From these results we can see that the Csub 
increases as the implantation energy increases. In Fig.4-8 we compare the results of the 7 keV 
and 9 keV samples, the Csub increases from 1.027% to 1.047 %. This difference is not 
significant.  
    The reason for the above results might be due to the difference in amorphous layer 
created by different implantation energies. In the research of K. Sekar et al., they found that 
the Csub will increase as the surface amorphous layer is thicker or the amorphous level is 
higher [3]. When energy increases from 3 keV to 7 keV, the amorphous layer thickness 
becomes thicker and level of amorphous becomes higher, so the Csub increases obviously. But 
when the energy increases from 7keV to 9keV, since the surface is nearly totally amorphous 
when the energy is 7 keV, the amorphous layers created at 7 keV and 9 keV don’t have 
evident difference, therefore, the Csub don’t have much difference. 
 
A-2. Effect of Implantation Dose 
To study the implantation dose effect, we fixed the carbon implantation temperature at 
5 C and implantation energy at 7 keV while the dose were controlled to 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 and 
8×10
15
 cm
-2
. The samples were annealed in N2 ambient at 750 C for 120 sec. 
From the XRD rocking curves shown in Fig.4-9, it is found that the Csub slightly 
increases from 1.037% to 1.127% when the dose increases from 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 to 8×10
15
 cm
-2
. 
But the Si-C peak of the 8×10
15
 cm
-2
 sample is broader and the peak intensity is lower than 
that of the 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 sample. The differences in the Si-C peaks indicate the crystalline 
quality of the Si-C is better in the 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 sample. The Si reference peak of the 8×10
15
 
cm
-2
 sample is also broader than that of the 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 sample, that means there are more 
interstitial carbons in the 8×10
15
 cm
-2
 sample. Comparing the Rs (sheet resistance) values, the 
value of the 8×10
15
 cm
-2
 sample is 391.7 ͈/  and the value of the 5×1015 cm-2 sample is 258 
͈/ . The significantly higher Rs value of the 8×1015 cm-2 sample supports the poor 
crystalline quality of this sample. 
Since the solid state solubility of carbon in silicon is very low [4], most of the implanted 
carbons are at interstitial sites. When carbon dose increases from 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 to 8×10
15
 cm
-2
, 
the amount of carbon incorporated into the interstitial site increases significantly. These 
interstitial carbons will form interstitial carbon defects [5] and increases the Rs value, the two 
70 
two-step annealing, and annealing temperature will be discussed. 
 
B-1. First Step Annealing Temperature 
    The ion implantation condition used to study the effect of annealing temperature is chuck 
temperature 5  C, implantation energy 7 keV, and implantation dose 5x10
15
 cm
-2
. The samples 
were then annealed in N2 ambient by RTA at 650  C to 850  C for 120 sec.  
    It has been listed in Table 4.1 that the Rs value decreases as the first step annealing 
temperature increases. The XRD rocking curves shown in Fig.4-11 indicate that the Csub 
increases from 0.88% to 0.973% as the first step annealing temperature increases from 650 C 
to 700 C, and the stronger Si-C peak intensity on the 700 C sample indicates better 
crystalline quality. As the annealing temperature increases from 700 C to 750 C, the Csub does 
not increase again but the Si-C peak intensity on the 750 C annealed sample is higher than 
that of the 700 C annealed sample. This result indicates that although the density of 
substitutional carbon does not increase but the crystalline quality can be improved as the 
annealing temperature increases to 750 C. When the annealing temperature further increases 
to 800 C, the Si-C peak nearly merges with the silicon reference peak. This means the density 
of substitutional carbon is very low. Increasing the annealing temperature to 850 C, the Si-C 
peak totally disappears, and the Si peak broadens. It means that there is nearly no 
substitutional carbon and the number of interstitial carbon increases dramatically. 
    During the thermal annealing process, the thermal energy provided by the annealing 
process affects the implanted carbons in two mechanisms [3]. The first one is to make the 
interstitial carbons incorporate into the substitutional site. The second one is to make the 
substitutional carbons diffuse into the interstitial site. When the annealing temperature is 
under 750 C, the first mechanism dominates in the process. For that reason, as temperature 
increased from 650 C to 750 C, the Csub density increased and the crystalline quality became 
better. But after the temperature is increased to 800 C or higher, the second mechanism starts 
to dominate, although some of the interstitial carbons diffuse into the substitutional site, but 
more carbons are tend to diffuse into the interstitial site. That makes the Csub density deceased 
as temperature increased to 800 C or higher, and the number of interstitial carbon increased at 
the same time. The highest solid state solubility of carbon in silicon is at the temperature of 
the melting point of silicon, which is 3.5²0.4Ø1017 cm-3, it is only about 7Ø10-4% which is 
very low [6]. Most of the implanted carbons were on interstitial site before annealing. During 
the SPE annealing process, the carbons were driven into substitutional site and reach 
72 
 
B-3. Second Step Annealing Condition 
In order to further increase the Csub, the feasibility of high temperature second step 
annealing is examined. In this experiment, carbon implantation was performed at chuck 
temperature -15 C and implantation energy 7 keV. The samples were annealed in N2 ambient 
by RTA at 750  C for 120 sec as the first step annealing. Two kinds of second step annealing 
were performed on different samples. The first one is annealed in the N2 ambient by RTA at 
1000 C for 1 sec in N2 ambient. The second one is PLA at 350mj/cm
2
 with 5 shots.  
    From the sheet resistance values listed in Table.4-2 and Table.4-3, after 1000  C /1 sec 
second step annealing, the sheet resistance deceases significantly. In the case of using PLA for 
the second step annealing, the sheet resistance does not change by the 5 to 20 shots of PLA 
process. According to the XRD spectra shown in Fig.4-13, after the 1000 C /1sec second step 
annealing, the Si-C peak totally disappears, which indicates no substitutional carbon. Fig.4-14 
shows the XRD rocking curves of the PLA sample with 5 shots of laser pulse. It is calculated 
that after PLA, the Csub doesn’t decrease but slightly increase from 1.046% to 1.091%. 
    The result can be explained by the following reason. By monitoring the temperature 
curve of 1000  C /1 sec second step anneal, we find the sample was annealed at temperature 
higher than 900ʚ for about 7 sec to 8 sec. Although the high temperature increases the 
carbon solid state solubility, the further thermal budget will drive the carbon atoms out of the 
substitutional sites. In the case of PLA, the laser pulse can melt the silicon surface. SiC 
formed in the SPE process will not melt due to its high melting point, and other carbons will 
incorporate into substitutional site to increase the Csub density [7]. That’s because the pulse 
duration is very short (25ns), after 5 shots of laser pulse, the effective annealing time is less 
than 125 ns, there’s no further thermal budget to drive the substitutional carbon out of the 
substitutional site. In the research of K. Sekar et al., they find mili-second flash anneal can 
increase Csub density, too [8]. So we speculate that the annealing time of second step anneal 
should not be longer than milli second. 
    In summary, suitable second step anneal can help to increase Csub. But the annealing time 
should not be longer than milli-second. Otherwise, the further thermal energy will drive the 
carbon atoms out of the substitutional site. PLA or Flash annealing is the ideal choice for the 
second step annealing technique. 
 
C. Comparison of Si-C Forming by PIII and Low Temperature Implantation

with a dose of 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 and chuck temperature at -15  C can create about 49nm thick high 
quality amorphous layer. After annealing at 750  C for 120 sec, we find the phosphorous will 
diffuse out from the carbon-rich region and the phosphorous profile will be shallower 
compare to as-implanted sample. That’s because the Sii in the carbon-rich region will diffuse 
to the shallower or deeper region of silicon substrate. The Sii diffuse to the deeper region will 
be trap by Si-C clusters and reduce the interstitial-assisted diffusion, and the Sii diffuse to the 
shallower region will make phosphorous diffuse with it and make the profile shallower. As 
low temperature carbon implantation applied to phosphorous doped NiSi/Si structure, we find 
it could not improve NiSi thermal stability, that’s because phosphorous atom will change the 
interfacial energy between nickel silicide and silicon. As low temperature carbon implantation 
applied to Si-C forming, we find as the implant energy is under 7keV, Csub density will 
increase as energy increase, that’s because higher energy can produce thicker amorphous layer 
with higher quality. The surface is near totally amorphous when implant energy is 7keV, so 
higher energy could not make significant Csub density difference. As carbon dose increased 
from 5×10
15
 cm
-2
 to 8×10
15
 cm
-2
, the Csub density did not increase significantly, that’s because 
the surface is totally amorphous when dose is 5×10
15
 cm
-2
, so higher dose won’t make 
significant difference on surface amorphous layer. The solid state solubility of carbon in 
silicon is very low even under supersatuation state, most of the implanted carbon is interstitial, 
too much carbon dose could not increase Csub density effectively but will increase the number 
of interstitial carbon and make the crystalline quality worse. Annealing at 750 C for 120 sec 
was found to be the best first step annealing condition in our experiment, more thermal budget 
will make the silicon substrate back to thermal equilibrium and decrease the Csub density. 
Second step annealing temperature should be higher than first step to increase the Csub density 
in super-satuation state, and the duration time should be less than 1sec. If the duration time is 
too long, too much thermal budget will decrease the Csub density. PLA for 5 shots at energy 
350mj/cm
2
 can increase Csub density from 1.046% to 1.091%, it indicates that PLA is a 
promising process to perform second step Si-C formation annealing. Finally, we find low 
temperature carbon ion implantation can produce higher Csub density after Si-C formation 
compare to CPIII, that’s because low temperature carbon ion implantation can produce thicker 
surface amorphous layer with high quality.

grown on a p-type Si substrate. Then, an 18-nm-thick amorphous Si film was deposited by a 
low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system as the channel layer. The 
amorphous Si film was recrystallized to poly-Si film during a SPC annealing at 600 
o
C for 24 
hr. The active region of poly-Si NW was defined by electron beam lithography (EBL) and 
reactive ion etching (RIE). The narrowest poly-Si NW width (WNW) is 35 nm as shown in Fig. 
5-2(a). The average grain size of the poly-Si channel inspected by plan-view transmission 
electron microscope (TEM) is about 55 nm as shown the inset in Fig. 5-2(a). 
A simple process was used to fabricate the GAA structure. The wet oxide, whose length, 
width, and depth is 1  m, 1 m, and 70 nm, under the poly-Si NW was removed by EBL and 
wet etching. Hence, the poly-Si NW was suspended from the wet oxide. Next, after the 
standard RCA cleaning process, a 25-nm-thick tetra-ethoxy-silane (TEOS) gate oxide and a 
200-nm-thick in-situ phosphorus-doped poly-Si gate were sequentially deposited followed by 
a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 1000 
o
C for 10 sec. Fig. 5-2(a) shows that the poly-Si NW 
channel was completely surrounded by TEOS gate oxide and poly-Si gate, and the darker area 
under the poly-Si NW contains grains of poly-Si gate with different orientations. The final 
poly-Si active layer thickness (TSi) was reduced to 8 nm owing to the several cleaning steps. 
The cross-sectional area of the narrowest NW is 35 nm x 8 nm. After poly-Si gate patterning, 
a 20-nm-thick TEOS SiO2 and a 20-nm-thick Si3N4 were deposited and etched to form a 
double spacer. To reduce the serious series resistance of the poly-Si NW’s S/D region, the 
low-temperature process of MSB Ni-silicide S/D was used for our GAA NW poly-Si TFTs. 
After removing the remnant TEOS SiO2 and/or native SiO2 on S/D and gate regions by dilute 
HF (DHF) solutions, the composite Ni(6 nm)/TiN(10 nm) films was continuously deposited 
by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) system. The two-step silicidation process was 
employed to form Ni-silicide [12]. Phosphorus ions were implanted into Ni-silicide at 10 keV 
with a dose of 5x10
15
 cm
-2
, then a furnace annealing at 600 
o
C for 30 min was performed to 
form N
+
 S/D extension. After recording the fresh current-voltage characteristics, a NH3 
plasma treatment at 300 
o
C for 5 min was performed to passivate the grain boundary defects. 
Fig. 5-2(b) displays the cross-sectional TEM micrograph along the channel direction. The 
shortest physical gate length is 30 nm. The plan-view channel area of the smallest GAA NW 
poly-Si TFT is smaller than the average poly-Si grain size, so there are few grain boundaries 
in the ultra scaling channel region. Therefore, the smallest GAA NW poly-Si TFT with NH3 
plasma treatment can be considered as the single-crystal-like logic device.

to the GAA structure. Therefore, the DIBL effect can be improved. The ION/IOFF current ratio 
is raised to 5x10
7
 at VDS = 1V. We believed that the VTH, S.S., DIBL, and ION values could be 
further improved by scaling equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) to get better gate 
controllability. 
Figure 5-12 shows the typical output characteristics of the NH3-passivated GAA NW 
poly-Si TFT with LG = 30 nm, WNW = 35 nm, and TSi = 8 nm. The key parameters of our 
GAA NW poly-Si TFT and some state-of-the-art TFTs [7-10] are summarized in the table 
inserted in Fig. 4. The linear relationship between IDS and VDS when the NH3-passivated GAA 
NW poly-Si TFT is biased in the linear region indicates that the MSB S/D has been 
successfully fabricated. The normalized driving current (IDS/WEFF) at VGS-VTH = 5 V and VDS 
= 1 V is 187  A/ m (WEFF = 2 x (WNW + TSi)). If normalized to the drawn channel width, the 
driving current can be as high as 459  A/ m. As we compared our device characteristics with 
state-of-the-art TFTs listed in references [7-10], our device shows the best driving current 
value due to the ultra short LG and fully silicided S/D. 
The gate dopant activation process at 1000 
o
C for 10 sec can be replaced by 600 
o
C for 
12 hr to avoid thermal budget issue in the 3D-IC application. We consider the device can still 
be retained because the rather thick EOT of the GAA NW poly-Si TFTs. 
 
5.4 Conclusions 
 The record smallest poly-Si NW TFT with GAA structure is demonstrated for the first 
time. The tight GAA and NW structure enhances the gate potential controllability effectively. 
Therefore, excellent short channel and narrow width behaviors can be obtained. It is 
demonstrated that the VTH, DIBL, and ION can be further improved by scaling the gate oxide 
thickness and by NH3 plasma treatment for defects passivation. These results reveal the 
possibility of 3D ICs.

High Performance Poly-Si Nano Wire Thin Film 
Transistors using the HfO2 Gate Dielectric 
6.1 Introduction 
 Polycrystalline-silicon thin film transistors (poly-Si TFTs) are extensively applied 
in the active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) at present. For high-level applications in 
the future, such as the peripheral integrated circuits (IC) of the system-on-panel (SOP) and 
three-dimensional (3D) IC, the high driving capability is necessary for the poly-Si TFTs. 
However, the normalized driving current of the most published poly-Si TFTs are still smaller 
than 100  A/ m [1-2]. Therefore, it is very important to improve the driving capability of the 
poly-Si TFTs. Most research on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs with the ultra-thin 
body (UTB) has shown excellent electrical characteristics [3-4], so the concept of the UTB 
could be easily extended to the poly-Si TFTs. Furthermore, several studies also indicate 
reducing the channel thickness of the poly-Si TFTs can also achieve larger driving current, 
lower leakage current, steeper subthreshold swing, and lower threshold voltage [5-6]. 
One issue of the ultra-thin poly-Si channel thickness is the degradation of its film quality. 
After the solid phase crystallization (SPC) process, the thinner poly-Si film consists of the 
smaller grain size and thus higher grain boundary trap density [5]. Therefore, the channel 
thickness of the published SPC poly-Si TFTs is just thinned to 20 nm [7]. The other issue of 
the poly-Si TFTs with the ultra-thin channel thickness is the large parasitic resistance at the 
source/drain (S/D) regions. Both of these issues degrade the driving capability of the poly-Si 
TFTs. In recent years, the poly-Si TFTs with various high-! gate dielectrics, such as hafnium 
dioxide (HfO2) and praseodymium oxide (Pr2O3), have been proposed to reduce the EOT 
[9-11] but the gate electrodes they used are close to planar structures.  
 On the basis of our previous work described in the previous chapter [8], we focus on the 
scaling of the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) by using the high-! gate dielectric in this 
chapter. The electrical characteristics of the poly-Si nanowire (NW) TFTs with the ultra short 
LG are investigated. The HfO2 gate dielectric and the novel omega-shaped (") gate structure 
are both employed to improve the gate-to-channel controllability and suppress the short 
102 
The LG and the ultra-thin poly-Si channel thickness (TSi) are 40 nm and 10 nm, respectively. 
The fully Ni-silicided S/D was successfully fabricated. The narrowest poly-Si NW channel 
width (WG) observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is 20 nm, as shown in the 
inset of Fig.6-1. 
For comparison, the other two devices named device B and device C were also 
fabricated by using the process flow described in reference [8] and [14], respectively. The 
active layer thickness and the gate dielectric thickness of all devices are listed in Fig.6-2. 
 
6.3 Results and Discussion 
To investigate the intrinsic gate-to-channel controllability without the influence of the 
SCE, the transfer characteristics of three non-sintered long-channel devices with LG = 5  m 
and WG = 10  m are compared in Fig.6-2. The linear region threshold voltage (VTH) is 
defined as the gate voltage (VGS) at which the drain current (IDS) equals to (WG/LG) x 10 nA at 
VDS = 0.05 V. The drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) value is calculated from the 
difference in VTH at VDS=0.05V and 0.5V. The device key parameters including the VTH, 
subthreshold swing (S.S.), and DIBL values are extracted and shown in the inserted table in 
the Fig.6-2. By comparing the device key parameters of the device B to those of the device C, 
it is observed that the scaling of the TSi and Tox can effectively improve the gate-to-channel 
controllability. The grain boundary trap density (Nt) is measured by Levinson’s method [15]. 
For device B with ultra-thin TSi of 8 nm, the Nt value is 5.266x10
12
 cm
-2
, and is comparable to 
that of SPC poly-Si TFTs with the thicker TSi [16]. Moreover, the off current of the device B 
is smaller than that of the device C owing to the thinner TSi. As the TEOS SiO2 gate dielectric 
is replaced by the HfO2 gate dielectric to further reduce the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), 
the device A exhibits the best transfer characteristics among these three devices. The S.S. and 
DIBL values can be further improved to 606 mV/dec and 2.283 V/V, respectively, but the 
gate-induced-drain-leakage (GIDL) effect is more apparent in the off-state as the result of the 
stronger electric filed between the gate electrode and the drain electrode. 
Figure 6-3 shows the non-sintered and sintered transfer characteristics of the poly-Si NW 
TFTs combined with the HfO2 gate dielectric, and its LG/WG is equal to 90 nm/20 nm, 
respectively. Before the sintering process, the VTH, S.S., and DIBL values are 2.561 V, 253 
mV/dec., and 0.459 V/V, respectively. It is indicated that the SCE can be greatly suppressed 
by the structure of the HfO2 gate dielectric, the ultra-thin poly-Si NW, and the omega-shaped 
gate structure. After utilizing the 400 #C forming gas sintering process to passivate the grain

出國報告 
 
此行主要任務是出席 9/11-9/13在德國慕尼黑舉行的 The 37th European 
Solid State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC 2007)，順便拜訪工業技術
研究院設在柏林的駐歐洲辦事處，但屬私人行程。行程如下： 
09/08   搭機赴德。 
09/09-09/10 拜訪工業技術研究院駐歐洲辦事處(私人行程) 
09/10   搭火車赴慕尼黑 
09/11-09/13 出席 ESSDERC 2007 
09/14   私人行程 
09/15-09/16 搭機返國行程。 
 
一、 整體面 
ESSDERC/ESSCIRC 是歐洲做主要的積體電路製造技術以及設計技術
領域的研討會，性質和每年六月輪流在日本京都和美國夏威夷舉行的 VLSI 
Technology/Circuit Symposium以及四月份在台灣舉行的 VLSI-TSA/DAT類
似，都包含製程技術和設計技術兩部份，不同的是 ESSDERC/ESSCIRC 是
在不同場地同時進行，另兩個研討會是在同一場地不同日期進行。 
本年度的 ESSDERC/ESSCIRC共有約 600人參加，兩部份人數差不多。
研討會報名費高達 560 歐元，約台幣 25000 元，但是研討會的品質很好。
會場服務周到，指標明確。會場供應果汁、汽水、紅茶、咖啡、餅乾、麵
包、蛋糕等各式茶點，並供應三天的午餐。午餐是在舉辦學校的空地搭建
的臨時餐廳，但是和台灣的「辦桌」水準不可同日而語。臨時餐廳是用鋼
樑、白色防水布幕搭建，高度超過 10公尺，並有通風設備。餐桌、餐椅、
餐具都是高級餐館的水準。三天的餐前菜、主菜、甜點都不一樣，非常可
致。最重要的是 Pulfrey認為 CNTFET相對於 Si MOSFET的優勢不夠顯著，
若考慮 Si MOSFET的製程成熟度，CNTFET未必能在實際應用上勝出，或
許可以先應用在 Si MOSFET不適用的場合。UCLA發表一篇以石墨分組曾
作為通道的碳元件，由於石墨的能隙太小(0.32eV)，on/off ratio並不理想，
但是若利用 Si source/drain形成 Schottky contact，可以提高 Rout，作者認為
或許在 analog或是 RF電路上有應用的可能，但是個人以為 Si device還是
較具優勢。 
9/12 上午以 Si emerging devices 為主，我們的論文也是安排在這個
session發表。連續三篇論文討論 I-MOS (Impact Ionization MOS)，雖然有快
速 switch 的優勢，但是從元件結構來看，不易微縮是最大的缺點。新加坡
的 Institute of Microelectronics發表以 Si nanowire製作的 inverter，這是全球
首度有 Gate-all-around Si nano-wire邏輯閘，轉換速度快，工作電壓可低至
0.2V，一方面顯示低功率應用的潛力，一方面展示新加坡在 GAA結構上的
領先。下午聆聽幾篇應變矽的論文，基本上還是在製程技術上加強，並沒
有特殊之處。但是新加坡大學整合 SiGe-OI基板、embedded SiGe layer、SiC 
source/drain，呈現相當不錯的特性。義大利的University of Udine提出 internal 
probe元件結構，直接測量通道電導，以擷取 mobility，具有參考價值。 
最後一天以和我們的研究有關的 Capacitor characterization 以及 charge 
trap memory聆聽重點。有兩篇論文討論如何校正以得到正確的 MIM電容
值。一篇用 RF 測試，從 S 參數轉換為 ABCD 參數，再扣除四元件等效電
路的寄生元件，方法稍嫌繁複，且未能考慮 dielectric loss。第二篇雖考慮
dielectric loss，但是只採用四元件等效電路，未考慮寄生電感。雖然都提出
成功的數據，但是根據我們的經驗，這樣的方法未必具有普遍性，應該不
如我們 2006年提出的五元件等效電路有效。NXP semiconductor公司提出以
resistance degradation判斷 dielectric lifetime的方法，可以在接近元件正常工
