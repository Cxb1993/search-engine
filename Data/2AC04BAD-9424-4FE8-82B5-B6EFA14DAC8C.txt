Treatment Arrangement: as shown in Figure 2. 
• First, two phased arrays were arranged to be face-to-face on the X’ axis and set 
both focal zones located at the center of the PTV (O’). 
• The focal zone of these two phased arrays was scanned sequentially with a 
switch-frequency of 9 Hz at the predetermined locations in the PTV with a 2 
mm interval. 
• As the maximum temperature of the PTV reached the target temperature (Ttgt), 
the set of phased arrays was rotated 90 degree on X-Y plane and then 
continued the sonication to achieve a uniform heating for the entire PTV.

of the two phased arrays and heating process.
  
 As the PTV was close to the ribs, the two phased arrays were tilted with a large 
angle of θT (65°) to be able to deliver the acoustic power to heat the PTV with a total 
acoustic reflection on the ribs. Fig. 1C showed the experiment setup and a 
color-changeable transparent phantom was used, and the color changed at 43℃. The 
attenuation coefficient of this phantom was 73.5 dB/m/MHz. Three thermocouples 
(TC1, TC2 and TC3) were inserted at the interface between bone and phantom. To 
compare the temperature elevations on the bone surface, the two phased arrays were 
tilted with a θT of 90° or 65°, and the distance from the PTV center to the bone 
surface was 1cm or 0.5cm.

N = 10, with d = 0.5 or 1cm.
 
CONCLUSION 
The simulation and experiment results indicated that the proposed heating system 
and strategy could produce a uniform desired heating treatment for breast tumor 
thermal therapy (Figs. 3-4). The acoustic beams emitted from the phased arrays 
were parallel to the chest wall and were able to minimize the temperature rise on 
the ribs (Fig. 5A). To be able to heat a PTV close to the chest wall and avoid the 
overheating on the ribs, the two phased arrays were tilted with an angle of θT (65
°). The distance between the center of PTV and the bone surface should be larger 
than 1cm (Fig. 5B) in order to effectively avoid the overheating on the ribs.
