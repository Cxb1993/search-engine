   The advantages of an automotive active suspension system have been promised 
for many years. A fully active or parallel active-passive suspension system based on 
hydraulic actuators seemed to be a good candidate for fulfilling such expectations. 
However the high frequency characteristics of such systems have been proved to be 
problematic for practical implementations. A high fidelity mathematical model 
capturing realistic dynamic behaviors of the hydraulic active suspension is required 
for the development of model based controller. In this project, we will aim at 
developing some intelligent control strategies that no explicit modeling is required 
and the stability can be guaranteed. Furthermore, consider the on-line learning of 
such controllers in a limited bandwidth half-vehicle tandem active-passive 
suspension systems subject to unlimited disturbance. The experimental results will 
be compared with passive suspension systems for achieving a good compromise 
between conflicting design requirements such as effective handling qualities and 
good ride comfort.

is shown in Fig. 1. There are two independent 
hydraulic power systems serve for road 
profile generating and active suspension 
control, respectively in each side. Each 
hydraulic power system consists of a variable 
displacement axial piston pump, two electro- 
hydraulic servo actuators and an accumulator. 
The actuators are controlled by two stage 
servo valves with four high-performance 
flapper nozzle.

III. THE STRUCTURE OF DAFC 
For the demonstration and explanation 
convenience, the schematic diagram of FLC 
based DAFC for active suspension system 
with 2 input variables and 4 outputs is 
illustrated in Fig. 2. In this architecture, two 
weighted summation of sliding surface 
variables is adopted as the input variables to 
reduce the non-square MIMO fuzzy logic 
system into a square MIMO fuzzy logic 
system by using the perturbation parameterδ . 
Hence, the fuzzy rules can be reduced from 
 to nq 2
n
q  (where is the number of the 
system output, is the number of the fuzzy 
sets). Accordingly, the design procedure and 
computation effort is simplified dramatically. 
In following section, the DAFC control 
algorithm for nonlinear square MIMO 
systems is described, the stability analysis is 
discussed, and the decoupled DAFC for a 
non-square MIMO system via the singular 
perturbation scheme is derived.

There three experimental cases are planned 
to verify the performance of the proposed 
active suspension control system and the 
experimental results are compared with that of 
the passive system.  
1) The road surface variation inputs are 
simulated by the outputs of the road 
profile generating system. They are 
specified as )5.2sin(5)( ttxuf π= and 
)5.2sin(5)( ttxur π=  for right and left 
suspension, respectively. The following 
control parameters: 
6.,24.,003.0,0003.0 2121 ==== ηημμ  are used in 
the adaptive law for these experiments. 
The dynamic responses of passive and 
active suspension systems are shown in 
Fig. 3 for comparison. Since the frequency 
of the sinusoidal wave road surface 
variation, 1.25 Hz, is near the natural 
frequency of the sprung mass, the 
resonant phenomenon of the sprung mass 
is excited in the passive suspension 
system. However, the active suspension 
system using DANC can reduce the 
amplitude of the vertical acceleration on 
the G.C. of the body effectively. The 
maximum amplitude is reduced from 
8.5 2sm to 1.3 2sm . 
2) The frequency responses of the passive 
and active suspension system with respect 
to another surface variation are shown in 
Fig. 4 for comparison. The road profile is 
superposed with six sinusoidal waves 
inputs from 0.5 to 20 Hz. The control 
parameters are the same as case 1. It can 
be observed that the power spectrum 
density (PSD) of the vertical acceleration 
on the G.C. of the body are reduced within 
10 Hz effectively for the introducing of 
active suspension control. However, when 
the road variation frequency beyond the 
wheel hop frequency (10Hz), the dynamic 
performance of the active suspension 
system is similar to that of the passive 
system. 
3) In this case, the bumpy road variation 
input is assigned. The road profile 
generating system is specified as 
sec)5.00(,5.7)( <<= ttxuf and  
for right and left suspension, respectively 
to simulate this road surface variation. 
The dynamic responses passive and active 
suspension systems are shown in Fig. 5 
for comparison. It can be observed that the 
DANC active suspension system can 
effectively reduce the vertical acceleration 
amplitude from 6
sec)15.0(,5.7)( <<= ttxur
2s
m  to 1 2sm  by 
comparing with that of the passive 
suspension. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The decoupled adaptive fuzzy controller 
(DAFC) combining with the singular 
perturbation scheme has been effectively 
implemented on a nonlinear non-square 
MIMO hydraulic active suspension system 
with an unknown model. The consequent 
parameters can be initialized at zeros, and an 
adaptive tuning law is employed to adjust 
them on-line for reducing the expertise 
dependency. The singular perturbation scheme 
can be used to decouple the non-square 
MIMO system into two square MIMO 
subsystems, then the stability of these 
subsystems are guaranteed by means of the 
Lyapunov stability criterion with the 
Kalman-Yacubovich lemma requirement 
relaxed using analysis of separate time scales. 
This novel controller can decouple the 
non-square MIMO nonlinear systems and 
monitor each subsystem dynamic output for 
tracking a user-defined reference model.
