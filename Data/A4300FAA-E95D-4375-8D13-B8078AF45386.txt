1Blind Adaptive Multicarrier-CDMA Receivers in
Multiuser and Multipath Communications
Jun-Da Chen
Abstract—OFDM-CDMA, which combines DS-CDMA with
OFDM, has become an attractive alternative to DS-CDMA for
future high-data-rate wireless communication systems. OFDM,
known as a special form of multicarrier modulation, incorporates
a large number of orthogonally selected subcarriers to transmit
a high-data-rate stream in parallel in the frequency domain.
In a single carrier system, a single fade or interference can
cause the entire link to fall, but in a multicarrier system, only
a small percentage of subcarriers will be affected. Thus OFDM
scheme is robust against frequency-selective fading and narrow-
band interference. The problem of intersymbol interference (ISI)
introduced by a multipath fading channel is significantly reduced
in OFDM due to the parallel data transmission through multiple
low-rate subcarriers. In addition, the orthogonal characteristic of
the subcarriers in OFDM allows the spectrum of each subcarrier
to be minimally densely overlapped in the frequency band. High
spectral efficiency and immunity from multipath are two major
advantages of the OFDM scheme. Furthermore, the multicarrier
modulation in OFDM can be implemented by the use of the
fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing without increasing the
system complexities of the transmitter and receiver.
In this project, we design the blind multiuser MC-CDMA
receivers by constrainted Constant modulus algorithm (CMA).
If the blind receiver has the chance to converge to the local
minimum, the system BER performance will becomes very poor
when the local minimum occur. A new constraint can guarantees
the global convergence in multipath environment. So the adaptive
receiver can converge to the desired user.
Index Terms—OFDM, MC-CDMA, MC-DS-CDMA.
I. INTRODUCTION
CDMA systems based on the direct-sequence (DS) spreadspectrum technique have drawn much interest for mobile
communication applications. However, the capacity of a DS-
CDMA system is limited by both multiuser and interchip
interference (ICI) in high-data-rate communication environ-
ments. The OFDM-CDMA, which combines DS-CDMA with
OFDM, has become an attractive alternative to DS-CDMA
for future high-data-rate wireless communication systems.
OFDM, known as a special form of multicarrier modula-
tion, incorporates a large number of orthogonally selected
subcarriers to transmit a high-data-rate stream in parallel in
the frequency domain. In a single carrier system, a single
fade or interference can cause the entire link to fall, but in
a multicarrier system, only a small percentage of subcarri-
ers will be affected. Thus OFDM scheme is robust against
frequency-selective fading and narrowband interference. The
problem of intersymbol interference (ISI) introduced by a
multipath fading channel is significantly reduced in OFDM
due to the parallel data transmission through multiple low-rate
subcarriers. In addition, the orthogonal characteristic of the
subcarriers in OFDM allows the spectrum of each subcarrier
to be minimally densely overlapped in the frequency band.
High spectral efficiency and immunity from multipath are
two major advantages of the OFDM scheme. Furthermore,
the multicarrier modulation in OFDM can be implemented
by the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing
without increasing the system complexities of the transmitter
and receiver.
From the purpose of detection of view, there are two
adaptive schemes for filtering as follows, trained detector and
blind detector. The blind detector does not require a training
sequence, but it does require an accurate knowledge of the
desired user’s spreading sequence. One of the simple blind
algorithms is the decision-directed scheme, its implementation
is only slightly more complex than that of conventional
adaptive equalizer. However, error propagation is easy to
produce in this algorithm. The other important adaptive blind
algorithms, including Sato, CMA, and Godard algorithms, use
the statistical property of the transmitted signal. In multiple-
user CDMA systems with time-varying multipath channels,
several users were transmitted simultaneously by modulating
signature waveforms. The interference can be cancelled by
utilizing orthogonal signals to transmit the data for each
user. Because the delays between receivers and transmitters
are always different, the received signals of the BS can’t
be regarded as orthogonal. This will cause the effect named
MAI which is especially severe for a short spreading code.
Most blind adaptive methods will fail when the interference
is correlated with the signal of interest as the MAI effect is
serious. The convergence behavior is shown in ref. [1]. Lee
extended the concept to multiuser CDMA system in ref. [2].
The blind adaptive equalizers of multiuser CDMA system
can be found in many literatures, such as ref. [3]-[6]. However,
the blind algorithms in MC-CDMA systems are only published
in a few literatures. [7]-[12] are blind channel estimation of
MC-CDMA. [13] uses the subspace method to equalize the
channel effect. [14]-[15] adopt the blind adaptive algorithms
to recover the channel effect. Besides, these few blind MC-
CDMA schemes didn’t ensure that they can converge to the
desired user. In fact, we have proposed the GSC-based blind
adaptive receiver which is a useful implementation of linearly
constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer in the
single carrier CDMA system in ref. [16]. The GSC-based
receiver is obtained by dividing the signal space into two
subspaces, a constraint subspace and an orthogonal subspace.
By this constraint, GSC filter possesses the property of global
convergence in multipath environment once the channel esti-
mation is appropriate. In [17], a linearly-constrained version
of the CMA, that is a typically adaptive blind algorithm,
was developed based on the decomposition property of the
3in the time-domain can be described as
r() =
−1X
=0
yˆ(;) + g() (3)
yˆ(;) = [ˆ−()  ˆ−1()
ˆ0() ˆ1()  ˆ−(+1)()
¤
g() = [0() 1()  −1()]
where yˆ(;) denotes the signal of the th path delayed 
sampling time, and g() is the additive noise vector containing
zero-mean, uncorrelated complex Gaussian noise (AWGN)
samples during the th MC block interval. The delayed path
is equivalent to the cyclic shift of the direct path because
the guard interval in the form of CP is appended in front
of the data block. From the expression (3), the distorted
signal through a dispersive channel can be viewed as a linear
combination of contents of all the attenuated paths. To further
express the received signal, we introduce a circular-shift matrix
I. I is formed by left shift the rows of the  × identity
matrix by amount  in a circular fashion, therefore, I0 = I
is the identity matrix. In other words, the ( )-th element of
I is I( ) = (−−)mod . By matrix I, we can write
yˆ(;) as yˆ(;) = Iyˆ(). Therefore, the received signal of
(3) can be rewritten as
r() =
−1X
=0
I
−1X
=0
yˆ()() + g() (4)
After discarding the samples corresponding to the CP, an
FFT of size  =  is performed, i.e. v() =
Fr(), and frequency deinterleaving takes place, the signals
at the output of the deinterleaver is given by v() =
[0() 1()  −1()] . Now we focus on the de-
spreading on the single data symbol of the desired user for
mathematical simplification, i.e.  = 1. In fact, when we
derive the algorithm for multiplication symbols (  1),
it must has some revision compared with single symbol.
Despite the derivation of multiplication symbols has been
accomplished, we only provide the single-symbol algorithm
in the report.
In this report, we exploit the LMS algorithm to realize the
adaptive receivers for the MC-CDMA communication system.
At first, we describe the conventional Despreader Filter used
to compare with our proposed GSC Filter.
A. Conventional Despreader Filter
We take the despreading code vector w() as a weight
vector to provide the estimation of the desired response (so
called Despreader Filter as shown in Fig. 2) according to the
received signal vector v(). At first, we need to initialize the
despreading code vector for the desired user  by setting it
equal to the original spreading code vector c(), which can be
denoted as w(0) = c(). The estimated data symbol ˆ() of
the desired signal () for the th user can be computed as
ˆ() = w()v().
We hope that the variance of the signal at the despreader
output approach to the variance of the transmitted data.
To achieve this goal we generate the cost function  =
µ

½¯¯¯b()¯¯¯2¾− 1¶2. Ignoring the expectation operation of
the cost function, we can rewrite this cost function as  =³b2()− 1´2 = ³b()− 1´2 ³b() + 1´2. Such cost func-
tion also meets the discreteness of the input data symbol,
and it is the same as the CMA. The receiver based on such
cost function can effectively deal with distortion of source
sequence. In using stochastic gradient algorithm to minimize
the cost function  we need to compute

w∗() = (
¯¯¯ b()¯¯¯2 − 1)[b∗()v()]
Thus the Despreader Filter can be represented as
w(+ 1) = w() + (
¯¯¯ b()¯¯¯2 − 1)[b∗()v()] (5)
where  is the step size.
B. GSC Filter
From (4), we can see that the received signal
without noise term after removing CP can be
rewritten as r() = {P−1=0 I}FCd(),
where C = [ c(0) · · ·  c(−1) ] whose column
is formed by each user’s spreading code and
d() = [(0)() (1)()  (−1)()] . Similar to
Despreader Filter, the estimated data symbol ˆ() of the
desired signal () for the th user can be computed as
ˆ() = w()Fr(). The goal of CMA is to find a weight
vector w that minimizes 　uctuation in the envelope of
the output b() Accordingly, the first step is to define a
cost function  that measures how far the output is from
a constant variance state. Since all the signals in CDMA
system are PSK modulated and have a constant variance,
in a CMA single-user detector, the desired user’s signal is
unnecessary but capture the signal variance instead. The linear
constrained minimum variance (LCMV) was proposed as a
method for controlling the behavior of the blind algorithm
in case of adaptive antenna arrays performing beamforming.
By using the analogy with beamforming, it can be applied to
MC-CDMA single-user detection.
The first step is to define a set of normalized linear con-
straints on the weight vector w. Each constraint is expressed
in terms of a constraint vector {P−1=0 I}Fc() and a
corresponding scalar constrained value  for the desired user
. Define the constrained matrixΦ ={P−1=0 I}FC, the
constrained condition thus can be compactly written in matrix
notation as
w()FΦ = g (6)
where g =
£
0 · · ·  · · · 0 ¤ is a matrix of dimen-
sions 1 × , and  is normalized to 1 for desired user .
By this constraint, we can ensure that all the MAI terms are
removed, and only the desired user’s signal ()() survived.
The overall linearly constrained CMA problem can be de-
scribed as minimizing the following cost function subject to
the constraint in (6)

½¯¯¯b()¯¯¯2¾− 1¶2 subject to w()FΦ = g (7)
5IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
This section provides learning curve comparisons of pro-
posed GSC receivers and Despreader Filter for 50 users at
0 = 15dB. Note that three conditions of GSC Filter
are considered, that is perfect channel estimation (bα=α), bias
channel estimation (bα=α − 01) and only the channel order
is known for the receiver (O(bα)=O(α)), where bα is the esti-
mation of the channel vector and O(·) means that the channel
order. We choose the Gold sequence of processing gain 127
as the spreading codes in QPSK modulation. Although in the
above derivation we only consider one QPSK symbol within
one OFDM symbol, we perform the simulations of two QPSK
symbols within one OFDM symbol to show our result in the
derivation of multiplication symbols (  1) . Note that the
ensemble-average learning curve is obtained by averaging the
instantaneous-squared-error “ | ()|2 versus  ” curve over
150 independent trials of the computer experiment, where
 () is difference between filter output b() and correspond-
ing transmitted symbol. To compare the performance between
the proposed receivers, we consider two kinds of COST 207
channels, rural area (RA) and typical urban area (TU). The
path number of former is only 2, while that of latter one is
11.
In the Figs. 4 and 5, the simulations of first QPSK symbol
and second QPSK symbol within one OFDM symbol in RA
environment are shown. Because of the frequency interleaving,
both symbols have similar results. We can see that in this short
path environment, each kind of GSC Filter obviously perform
better than Despreader Filter. However, In the Figs. 6 and 7, the
performances of GSC Filter with bias channel estimation and
with channel order are degraded to close to that of Despreader
Filter in TU environment. This is because the TU channel has
longer path number than RA channel, the channel estimation
plays an important role in this environment. Also, in these
figures, we can see that the convergence rate of each kind of
GSC Filter is shorter than Despreder Filter.
