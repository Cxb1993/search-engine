Abstract 
A storm beach buffer, being different from the coastal set back currently in place in many 
countries in the world, is the provision of a sufficient beach width to safe guard against the 
onslaught of a fierce storm. The main purpose of its establishment is not to meet the ecological 
needs but for the mitigation of coastal disaster, particularly through the provision of a beach berm 
that may be completely removed by storm waves thereby sparing the infrastructures landward. If 
this extent of berm is properly protected by a suitable device prior to the attack of storm waves, 
the return of the material removed by the storm may also be ensured. Despite the importance of 
this theme, reports are rather limited as one searching through the literatures, perhaps due to the 
complexity of the phenomena and the factors involved. However, since the integration of beach 
nourishment with suitable artificial headlands to protect the fill has become a popular trend 
worldwide for an eroding coast, either for shore protection or even for recreation, it is imperative 
to study the phenomena of beach profile changes associated with a storm activity, and more 
importantly to quantify the beach buffer width for practical engineering projects. 
However, for an artificially nourished bay beach, its berm width, profile and stability may be 
affected by waves and surge induced by the storm; resulting in beach retreat if the buffer was 
insufficient. During fair weather, waves undergo refraction and diffraction around a headland, as 
they enter a bay, and sculpture the beach in its lee to form an embayment. The wave sheltering 
effect produces non-uniform wave height distribution within the embayment, hence requiring 
variable buffer widths along its curved shoreline to meet the onslaught of a storm. Therefore, it is 
necessary to provide an appropriate beach width to reduce the threat to infrastructures and assist 
in beach recovery after its berm being removed by the storm. 
The main purpose of this study is to estimate a storm beach buffer for the mitigation of 
coastal disaster, by the provision of an adequate berm for the storm waves, rather to meet the 
ecological needs. The software used include SBEACH and the Spanish SMC, in which the output 
of wave height distribution from SMC is used for running SBEACH model. This paper aims to 
quantify the beach buffer width for a beach nourishment project and formation of bar induced by 
storm waves. The modeling results would benefit the planning of a beach nourishment project 
incorporating headlands for mitigation of erosion and the design of recreational beach. 
Keywords：storm beach buffer, artificial nourishment, storm-built beach profile, modeling of

University of Hanover（UH）大型波浪水槽（LWT: Large Wave Tank）的試驗，說明灘線後
退與潛洲成長隨時間的演變。Silvester and Hsu（1993, 1997）則考慮平台與潛洲體積在侵淤
平衡的條件下，彙整美國 CERC、日本 CRIEPI 以及德國 UH 等共 20 個相關 LWT 試驗結果，
探討潛洲頂高與離岸距離、潛洲體積及灘線後退量與短期灘線後退及潛洲變化的關係，並
提出最終理想化剖面參數經驗式。隨後，Hsu and Wang（1997）利用 Silvester and Hsu（1993）
提出的剖面參數經驗式，進一步將剖面資料加以迴歸分析，藉以得到潛洲體積、深海波高
波長及灘線侵蝕距離等相關因素的經驗關係式。Dette et al.（2002）利用德國 UH 的大型波
浪水槽（德文 Grosser Wellen Kanal: 簡稱 GWK，相當於英文的 LWT），進行一系列的試驗，
探討不同波浪條件、波浪作用時間及水工構造物等因素，對海灘剖面變化與沙灘流失量的
影響。 
然而上述有關海灘平衡剖面形狀之預測模式，大都未探討海灘經過颱風巨浪侵襲後之
海灘剖面變化過程，亦未考慮所造成的灘線後退最大幅度與暴浪作用的關係。基此，本研
究團隊已於去年以海岸防護區在遭受颱風巨浪暴潮侵襲之海灘侵蝕為出發點，用 CEDAS
中的 SBEACH 模組估算海灘被侵蝕後，沙土在近岸堆積為潛洲之海灘剖面變化及海岸線後
退之幅度，以及探討不同粒徑與緩衝帶關係（李等，2009；林等，2009）；故在本延續計畫
的研究，主要針對灣岸內人工養灘受颱風侵蝕後的海灘剖面為主要考量。 
四、研究方法 
在數種海灘剖面變遷的相關數值模式，目前較常被引用的有美國 Veri-Tech 公司推廣的
CEDAS 中的 SBEACH（Storm-induced BEAch CHange）模組，及西班牙 Cantabria 大學的
SMC（Coastal Modeling System）模式。 
SBEACH原是瑞典Lund大學Magnus Larson教授之博士論文及後續研究成果之彙整。
該模組主要被引用於模擬颱風波浪在數小時或數日內快速造成的海灘剖面變化，可供模擬
巨浪侵襲時的海灘剖面變化。該模式是以大型波浪水槽（以簡諧波在近乎原型比例的波高
和週期進行試驗）的海灘剖面時間變化資料為基礎，再加以廣域的實驗資料分析，建構了
波浪作用與海灘剖面變化的交互關係。在大型水槽實驗資料分析和相關物理條件為基礎下，
數值模式得以發展，並在大型水槽剖面變化的模擬測試中獲得良好的模擬結果。為了區別
近岸不同的波浪動力行為及不同流況下之漂沙物理特性，Larson（1988）將向、離岸方向
的漂沙狀況，分為四個區域，如圖 4-1。

五、結果與討論 
5-1  模擬之地形與波浪資料 
本研究所模擬之海域為一均勻等水深坡降的地形（圖 5-1），並在水深-8m 處設立一長
約 400m；寬約 50m 的岬頭。當波浪自外海進入近岸，經由折射和岬頭的繞射效應，在岬
頭後側形成灣岸。海灘斷面則規劃與水深垂直之 Sec1 與灣岸內垂直等水深線之 Sec2~4 等
四條，分別表示不受灣岸影響之 Sec1；岬頭處之 Sec2 及灣岸內之 Sec3 與 Sec4，各斷面之
剖面變化如圖 5-2，其濱台高度均為 2m；Sec1 至水深-10m；Sec2~4 則至水深-6m。海灘中
值粒徑擬以西子灣海岸之底質中值粒徑（ 2.050 =D mm）進行模擬。 
模擬的波浪條件為引用中華顧問工程司（2005）「高雄西子灣海岸計畫整體規劃暨高雄
西子灣海岸計畫第一階段景觀改善示範工程委託設計」（高雄市政府工務局局委託）研究報
告中之高雄港外海（依據 1940~2004 年間之颱風資料推算，目標區水深-75m）迴歸設計波
高（表 5-1）及平均潮位（+0.74m）。其中暴潮偏差水位部份則參考許泰文（2003）中之颱
風路徑 4 通過高雄附近海域，造成各重現期暴潮偏差水位。設計水位為平均潮位再加上各
重現期暴潮偏差水位，主要考量颱風暴浪挾帶強大能量進入近岸時，強烈低氣壓使海平面
驟昇，同時波高也隨淺化而加劇，後灘沙土受侵蝕與挖掘，被掏走之沙土往碎波點以外沉
積形成潛洲，因此研擬海岸緩衝帶寬度時，除了考量波浪作用外，設計水位必須包含潮位
與暴潮偏差的情況下。

若依各斷面表示，海岸緩衝帶寬度與無因次沉降速度關係如圖 5-7（由於 Sec4 僅有二

ωt 增加而減少，可能是波浪提前在沙洲頂點碎波，削減大部份的波浪能量，且 Sec1 所需
規劃的海岸緩衝帶寬度較其他斷面大。位於岬頭處 Sec2 之海岸緩衝帶寬度隨無因次沉降速
度的增加而增加；而在灣岸內之 Sec3 可能受到岬頭的遮蔽效應，其海岸緩衝帶寬度則先隨
無因次沉降速度增加而增加；但當 H/ωt>5 後，所需海岸緩衝帶寬度則隨無因次沉降速度
增加而減少。海岸緩衝帶寬度在不同斷面之結果，經迴歸分析所得數學式，如表 3。由此
迴歸式，僅需輸入深海波浪高及波長，即可初步估算岬頭處及灣岸內之海岸緩衝帶寬度。

upper layer was larger than the bottom layer in order to 
facilitate the physically existence of an elevated IW. The 
results demonstrate the inversion of a depression ISW into 
elevation on the horizontal plateau beyond a turning point. 
Detailed examination also includes the influence of inversion 
on the wave amplitude, phase speed and energy of the inverted 
new wave across the plateau.

repeated transects across one internal wave, with the first on the top         
panel and the last at the bottom [9]. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 
In the laboratory experiments, a depression ISW was 
produced in a stratified two-layer fluid system within a 
steel-framed wave tank 12 m long, 0.7 m high by 0.5 m wide 
at the National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan. The fluid 
density in the upper (fresh) and lower (brine) layers was 996 
and 1030 kg/m3, respectively. The experimental apparatus, 
including the shelf-slope topography, five ultrasonic probes 
and other recording devices, are illustrated in Fig. 4. A 
shelf-slope topography made of smooth impermeable acrylic 
(0.37 m high and 6.3 m long), had a horizontal plateau 4.8 m 
long and front slope with 1.5 m in horizontal projection. The 
front toe was located near the middle of the tank where the 
total water depth H (= h1+h2) was 0.55 m in all the 
experiments. In order to study the inversion, the depth of 
upper layer larger than that of the lower layer was purposely 
arranged on the plateau. A total of 23 runs were performed 
(Table 1). An ISW was generated by a “collapse” mechanism 
arising from the difference in the interface level on either side 
of a vertical sluice gate, which when opened produced the 
overturning of the water column and induced required ISW. 
The relative difference in the water depth between the upper 
and lower layer (i.e., step depth η0; see Fig. 4) and initial ISW 
amplitude (a1) were two of the main input parameters.  
During the experiments, probe 1 recorded the amplitude of 
the incident ISW; probes 2 and 3 measured the waveform of 
the ISW on the front slope of the trapezoidal obstacle; while 
probes 4 and 5 measured the evolution of the transmitted wave 
above the horizontal plateau. Dyes were injected at selected 
locations to aid in flow visualization and observation of the 
mixing process of the ISW propagating over the trapezoidal 
obstacle. The fluorescent red and blue dyes which had 
densities of 1011 and 1020 kg/m3, respectively, floated in the 
upper and lower layers.

III. EVOLUTION OF A DEPRESSION ISW OVER A TRAPEZOIDAL 
OBSTACLE 
A. Wave Evolution on the Front Slope 
As a depression ISW propagating toward a trapezoidal 
obstacle, its leading trough encountered the front slope first, 
prior to across the shoulder, then onto the horizontal plateau. 
With large incident amplitude (a1),of the ISW  intense 
breaking and vortex motion were observed on the front slope. 
                                                              出席國際會議心得 2 (許榮中)   5 
waveform indicated by the wave profiles at probes 4 and 5 
was mainly in elevation type, while probe 3 showed an ISW of 
depression with increasing strength of elevation at the trailing 
end. It may be concluded that this waveform inversion (from 
probe 3 to probe 4) was generated after the turning point 
despite the occurrence of wave breaking. Overall, the process 
of waveform inversion and generation of a new wave of 
elevation-type occurred in two steps: First, through turbulent 
mixing and the formation of a strong vortex on the slope; and 
second, by shoaling and propagating along the horizontal 
plateau where the upper layer was thicker than the lower layer. 
Upon comparing the images in Fig. 5 and waveform profiles 
in Fig. 7, the waveform at probe 3 had unusual waveform 
consisting of an elevated bolus together with a large trough in 
depression. This process could provide extra energy input to 
the subsequent wave evolution on the plateau. 
 
Figure 7 Time series of ISW profiles recorded by ultrasonic probes at five 
locations along a wave tank. (Experimental conditions: h1 = 0.14 m,              
h2 = 0.41 m, hs = 0.37 m, a1 = 0.05 m; see Fig. 4 for notation) 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Dimensionless parameters for wave amplitude, group speed 
and energy are defined and their values calculated from the 
recorded wave profiles for further analysis on waveform 
inversion. The amplitude of each wave crest or trough is 
calculated using the maximum or minimum of each leading 
wave component in the records (e.g. Fig. 7). By relating the 
amplitude of the crest to trough at each probe location, the 
dimensionless amplitude ratios (At1, At2, At4 and At5; see (1) ~ 
(4) below) can help indicate the wave type at each location. 
For example, Ati = 1 (i = 1, 2, 4, 5) implies equal amplitude of 
crest to trough, Ati > 1 for crest greater than trough, and Ati << 
1 for an almost complete depression waveform. Furthermore, 
the non-dimensional incident amplitude or relative incident 
wave amplitude (α) related to the thickness of the bottom layer 
above the horizontal plateau is used in (5); while (6) and (7) 
denote the relative transmitted wave amplitude (TA) and 
transmitted energy (TE), respectively, at the down drift end of 
the journey at probe 5 for the physical properties in relation to 
the incident wave conditions.

TE = E5+ / E1- or E5- / E1-                                           
(7) 
In (1)~(7) above, a1+, a1-, a2+, a2-, a4+, a4-, a5+ and a5- are the 
amplitude of the crest or trough of the leading waveform at 
probes 1, 2, 4 and 5, respectively (with the vertical z-axis 
positive upwards from the original interface); h1 and h2 are the 
depth of the upper layer and bottom layer at probe 1 location 
(see Fig. 4), hs is the vertical height of the trapezoidal obstacle, 
and hs1 and hs2 denote the thickness of the upper and bottom 
layer above the horizontal plateau. The wave energy (E) 
defined by Michallet and Ivey [14] for the trough of a 
depression wave (Fig. 8(a)) is now extended to the complete 
wave profile of trough to crest (as conventionally employed in 
dealing with surface gravity waves, Fig. 8(b)) in order to study 
ISW waveform inversion from depression to elevation:

In (8), ai is the amplitude of each leading ISW at each 
location to be analyzed, C the wave phase speed, g the 
acceleration due to gravity, η the temporal interface level of 
the wave motion, and △ρ = ρ2 - ρ1, where ρ1and ρ2 are the fluid 
density of the upper and bottom layer, respectively. The 
difference in time, t1 - t0, is termed as characteristic period 
(Pw), calculated from a leading wave profile at two 
consecutive time steps t1 and t0 for the first and second 
zero-down crossing points on a wave record. Subscripts – and

respectively.

A. Waveform Inversion 
The likelihood of waveform inversion as a depression ISW 
propagates over a slope-shelf topography can be determined 
from the ratio between dimensionless amplitude α versus 
characteristic amplitude at crests and troughs. The ratios 
recorded at probes 1, 2, 4 and 5 (At1, At2, At4 and At5) are used 
to compile the picture seen in Fig. 9. The symbols (circles,

D. Variation in Transmitted Wave Energy 
Beside the variation in the transmitted wave amplitude (e.g., 
Fig. 10) and phase speed (Fig. 11), energy is calculated using 
(8) from the wave profile recorded by probe 5, from which 
energy dissipation of the leading wave can be obtained. By 
plotting the relative transmitted energy (TE) at probe 5 versus 
the relative incident amplitude (α) as in Fig. 12, a generally 
rapid decreasing trend for the wave energy associated with the 
trough can be appreciated on the plateau, as an elevated 
waveform propagating above it. As α increased, the resultant 
energy for the crest (TE+) and trough (TE-) at probe 5 location 
had a slow increasing trend, due to the fact that large portion 
of the energy dissipation was associated with intense wave 
breaking on the front slope, and the consolidation of the 
elevated IW above the plateau on which its upper layer was 
greater than the bottom layer. Interestingly, as α increased, 
energy for the crest (TE+) on the plateau did not increase 
proportional to the square of the amplitude, perhaps because a 
large amount of the energy had lost due to intense breaking on 
the front slope.

E. Variation in Transmitted Wave Period 
Whilst a depression ISW encountered a submarine obstacle 
(e.g., ridge or shelf), the fundamental frequency of the leading 
wave observed in field condition [15] was found to shift from 
low to high value (from long to short period). Although the 
frequency variability was identified, the process of frequency 
evolution had never been quantified, particularly for that 
related to waveform inversion. In order to study the variations 
in the period associated with waveform inversion, the HHT 
method [16] is used to analyze the time series data recorded 
by four ultrasonic probes in the present laboratory experiments. 
A record with time interval of 40 sec was taken from in each 
record. 
The outputs of marginal spectrum and time-frequency and 
energy spectrum from HHT at four probe locations (1, 2, 4 
and 5) are given in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14, respectively. In Fig. 13, 
the frequency increased from 19.95 s at (P1) to 26.30 s (P2), 
and increased further to 31.62 s at P4, following by 
conspicuous reduction to 8.32 s at P5. This implies that the 
wave period of a depression ISW reduced from 19.95 to 8.32 
seconds. A close examination of Fig. 14 finds that, from P1 to 
P5, the frequency band shifted from log 1.3~1.6 s to log 
0.9~1.4 s, indicating the down-shift of the active wave period, 
with center around log 4.4 s at P2 and P4. Comparing the four 
sub-plots in Fig. 13 for the fundamental frequency of the 
incident ISW, this frequency shift into shorter period band 
associated with the new ISW of elevation was obvious. Again, 
the marginal spectrum of P1 and P5 in Fig. 13 suggests energy 
of the leading wave suffered a significant dissipation when it 
propagated across a trapezoidal obstacle. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
The laboratory study on the propagation of a depression 
ISW over a trapezoidal obstacle help understand the process 
of waveform evolution over a shelf-slope topography in field 
condition. Employing the water depth of the upper layer 
greater than the lower part on s horizontal plateau, waveform 
inversion became apparent on a shelf-slope topography. In all 
the 23 runs examined, the phase speed decreased significantly 
toward the shoulder of the shelf-slope, especially after a strong 
vortex on the upper reach of the slope, which consequently 
triggered wave inversion. In addition, the transmitted wave 
amplitude, wave speed and wave energy were influenced by 
the depth ratio between the upper and lower layers above the 
horizontal plateau.  
As a depression ISW shoaled from deepwater, waveform 
inversion could be observed on the plateau, under favorable 
depth condition. However, the mechanism responsible for 
promoting waveform inversion depended mainly on the 
magnitude of the dimensionless amplitude α. For a large 
incident ISW of depression, an elevation IW could be 
generated by the combined effects of interface draw-down, 
internal hydraulic jump, vortex, turbulent mixing and run-up 
on the front slope. On the other hand, for a depression ISW in 
small amplitude, waveform inversion was controlled by 
shoaling effect. In both cases, waveform commenced 
inversion from depression into elevation around the turning 
point. Moreover, most of the incident energy was dissipated as

STORM BEACH BUFFER REQUIREMENT FOR STORM WAVES  
FROM A TROPICAL CYCLONE 
Fang-Chun Lee1, Wen-Hua Lin1, John R.-C. Hsu1 
Storm beach buffer, being different from the coastal set back currently in place in many countries in the world, is the 
provision of a sufficient beach width to safe guard against the onslaught of a fierce storm. The extent of this 
requirement is tentatively assessed using the SBEACH module in the CEDAS package. The inputs for the SBEACH 
module include berm width, medium sand grain diameter, beach slope, design water level and wave conditions; while 
the outputs consist of a range of characteristic parameters for the change in beach profile, especially berm erosion and 
bar formation resulting from a storm of different return periods. After having systematically performed a series of 
numerical studies, we may conclude that: (1) Berm erosion increases and bar becomes further offshore as the storm 
return period increases on a beach with identical sand grain size (i.e., non-dimensional fall velocity), or as sand grain 
dimension reduces; (2) Higher storm waves result in a larger bar to form quicker and cause wave breaking on the bar 
crest which could reduce the wave energy and limit the extent of the subsequent berm erosion; (3) Empirical equations 
can be derived to calculate the storm beach buffer width; and (4) A larger buffer is required for a beach with smaller 
sand grain, in order to effectively absorb the storm wave energy. The results presented in this paper can be used to 
assist in a beach nourishment project for shore protection and the design of a recreational beach. 
Keywords: storm beach buffer, berm erosion, bar distance offshore, storm return period, beach profile changes 
INTRODUCTION 
The provision of an adequate storm beach buffer is necessary for the safety of a beach during 
storm events and ecological conservation. A beach functions not only as the habitat for marine fauna 
and flora, but also for the needed protection against the onslaught of a fierce storm. During a storm, the 
stability of a berm, dune and associated beach profile is affected by large waves and high storm surges, 
resulting in permanent beach retreat if the buffer is insufficient. For example, Hurricane Bob which 
caused a strong northeast storm on the Halloween Eve in 1991 along Massachusetts' North and South 
Shores in the United States had reduced a significant portion of the beach/barrier buffer zone 
(Fitzgerald et al., 1994). The widespread and severe damage to the dwellings occurred along the South 
Shore in the areas where beaches were narrow or nonexistent and places where houses were subjected 
to gravel overwash. In Japan, many sections of the Ibaraki coast were once protected by sandy beaches 
with dunes, but were eroded after port construction; thus reducing the beach width from a few hundred 
meters to a few ten meters. Consequently, storm waves and severe surges broke seawalls and cut sand 
dunes, during typhoon Bebeica event in October, 2006, despite the existence of protective hard 
structures (Hisamichi, 2008). 
Nowadays, artificial nourishment schemes incorporating man-made headlands have been carried 
out in many countries for the design of recreational beach and shore protection. The performance of 
such a scheme depends on the duration (or longevity) of the fill material to be retained on the new 
beach. On a beach frequented by storms, the extra volume of new sediment on an existing beach offers 
better protection against the onslaught of a fierce storm. Hanson et al. (2002), among many others, 
have reported several successful coastal projects with artificial nourishment in Europe. In Taiwan, 
nourishment projects were executed at Anping during 2002~2004 and Sizihwan between 2006~2008. 
Both are in the southwestern Taiwan, where artificial beach was produced by nourishment 
incorporating man-made headlands of groin type, from dredged navigation channel and offshore site, 
respectively. After several storm events, both sites had experienced beach retreat in the middle of the 
embayment (see Fig. 1), due to insufficient storm buffer width. 
In addition, for an artificially nourished beach incorporating man-made headlands, sufficient berm 
width should be taken to delineate the shoreline planform in static equilibrium in order to ensure the 
safety of a beach during a storm, in addition to the simultaneous requirement of the equilibrium beach 
profile (EBP). To accomplish this objective, the headland tip should be located preferably beyond the 
distance of bar position that could exist. The aim of this paper is to discuss the need and quantification 
of adequate berm width for a design storm of assumed return period in order to mitigate local beach 
erosion. The preliminary results derived from a series of numerical computations using the SBEACH

We first examine the effects of the two principal parameters (i.e., transport rate coefficient, K, and 
the slope-related sand transport coefficient, ε) on beach profile changes. The procedure involves the 
comparison of the entire profiles derived from the simulation using SBEACH with that measured from 
the selected LWT cases cited in Kraus and Larson (1988).

MODELING PROCEDURE 
A storm-built beach profile may result by storm action on an initial EBP in the form of 3/2Axh =  as 
given by Bruun (1954) and Dean (1997). In this expression, h (m) is the depth from a reference 
sealevel, and x is the distance offshore. ( )4400670 ..A ω=  is the dimensional shape factor (Dean, 1997), 
where the fall velocity ω  is related to a sediment grain size (D50), which in turn affects the berm slope 
and nominal sediment fall velocity as shown in Fig. 7 (data from Wiegel, 1965). From this, the value 
for the dimensionless fall velocity, TH ω0 , can be calculated.

Using a typical beach profile (berm height 2.5 m with width 100 m) and the typhoon wave 
conditions given in Table 2, SBEACH model was then used to calculate the beach profile changes 
under monochromatic waves. Specific attention was given to berm erosion and bar location, for a 
design storm with different return periods, sand grain diameter and beach slope. 
In the numerical calculations for a storm event with 50-year return period on a beach with D50= 
0.25 mm, the temporal output from SBEACH model (Fig. 9) indicates that the berm was eroded 
rapidly within the first 9 hours but held back for a short while about 3 hrs between 9th ~ 12th hrs, then 
followed by two cycles of moderate erosion, before reaching a final asymptote of berm erosion after 
the 39th hrs. While the berm was experiencing erosion and eventually reaching a limit as indicated in 
this figure, the water depth on the bar crest decreased progressively and became steady afterward. It is 
suspected that, between the 39th and 60th hrs, material to build up the bar may come from the region 
between the bar and the newly eroded shoreline, rather from further berm erosion. As seen in Fig. 9, 
berm erosion and bar depth increase with the duration of storm action. However, calculation is 
terminated when berm erosion ceases or bar depth reaches a constant value. In this particular case, the 
total run time of 48 hours may be taken as the effective duration for the storm action on the beach.

BERM EROSION AND BAR LOCATION 
Effect of storm return period 
SBEACH model is used to simulate beach profile changes for storm waves with different return 
periods (10, 20 and 50 years, respectively) on a sandy beach with D50= 0.25 mm and a constant mean 
sea level. From the variation in the resulting dimensionless berm erosion (
0LX b ) versus 
dimensionless fall velocity TH ω0  for different storm return periods shown in Fig.10, the worst berm 
erosion (
0LX b ) appear to occur for storm with 50-year return period with wave from all possible 
directions.

Effect of sand grain size 
The dimension of sand grain size on a beach affects berm slope and subsequent profile changes 
under variable wave actions. For example, the simulated results for berm erosion 
0LX b  (Fig. 12) 
indicate that a beach responds differently with D50 varying from 0.2 to 0.4 mm, under the same 
condition of mean sea level and 20-year storm return period. The dimensionless berm erosion 
0LX b  
varies not only implicitly with TH ω0 , but also explicitly with D50.

The relationship between bar crest location

offshore) as TH ω0  increases for all the four D50 values under consideration.

APPRAISAL OF STORM BUFFER WIDTH USING SBEACH 
Since it is a common belief that a wide sandy beach is the most effective wave energy absorber for 
shore protection, the question is how to determine an adequate storm buffer, in order to protect the 
beach. For places without storm attack, berm erosion would never become a problem. On the other 
hand, berm erosion varies with storm wave conditions arising from different return periods, which is 
the most influential factor for the appraisal of storm buffer width for a beach with a specific D50. Based 
on the results of a series of numerical calculations, a regressed equation for storm buffer width (X in 
Fig. 2) may be expressed by a multiple linear regression model:

Eq. (6) may be used to estimate the storm buffer from a given set of inputs values ( H0 (m), T (sec) , 
D50 (mm) and ω (m/s)) directly. The result suggests 0HX  value decreases either as TH ω0  increases 
under a specific D50 or as the D50 increases under the same wave conditions (H0 and T). One possible 
reason is perhaps due to the wave would have broken on the bar crest accompanying by wave energy 
dissipation, thus limiting further berm erosion in the lee of the bar. It also implies that a wider storm 
buffer is required for a beach with smaller D50. Verification using field data has also shown to be 
satisfactory. 
 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presents the results of modeling beach profile changes using the well-known SBEACH 
module. After the successful calibration of four selected beach profiles in CERC’s LWT tests (Kraus 
and Larson, 1988), upon matching the characteristic features of the entire profile changes (especially 
berm erosion and bar shape), the best combination of the two key parameters (sand transport rate 
coefficient, K and slope-related sand transport coefficient, ε) for other cases can be estimated using 
similar procedure from given input conditions (i.e., storm waves (H0 and T) for a specific return period, 
D50 and design water level). 
After having performed a series of numerical study, regression equations are then proposed for the 
appraisal of storm beach buffer width as a function of wave conditions (H0 and T) and medium grain 
size (D50, fall velocity ω). From these, we may conclude that (1) Berm erosion increases and bar 
becomes further away offshore on a beach with small sand grain; (2) Storm wave could break on the 
bar crest in the later stage of a storm event, which could reduce storm wave energy and limits 
subsequent berm erosion; (3) A larger buffer is required for beach with smaller sand grain, in order to 
effectively absorb storm wave energy.
