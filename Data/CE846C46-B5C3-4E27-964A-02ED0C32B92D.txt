 frequency and continuously amplify a co-propagating electromagnetic wave. The 
interactions occur when the resonance condition 0≅Ω−− czz svkω  is satisfied, where ω  
is the wave frequency,  is the propagation constant,  is the electron axial velocity,  
is the cyclotron harmonic number, and 
zk zv s
cΩ (= cmeeB γ/0 ) is the relative electron cyclotron 
frequency. 
The performance of early gyro-TWT experiments was limited by spurious oscillations.2-3 
Recently however, high power and gain were achieved in gyro-TWT experiments by using an 
interaction structure with distributed wall losses to suppress spurious oscillations. At the 
National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Taiwan, a gyro-TWT experiment provided 
zero-drive stability at ultrahigh gain. The experiment produced a saturated peak power of 93 
kW at a 70 dB gain and 26.5% efficiency with a 3 dB bandwidth of 8.6% in the Ka-band.4-5 At 
the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), a Ka-band gyro-TWT experiment employed lossy 
ceramic structures to provide the required loss for stable operation and high-average power 
compatibility. The experiment produced a saturated peak power of 137 kW at a gain of 47 dB 
and an efficiency of 17% with a 3 dB bandwidth of 3.3% in the Ka-band.6-7 At UCD, a 
W-band gyro-TWT experiment yielded 59 kW saturated power at 92.2 GHz with 42 dB gain, 
26.6% efficiency and a 3 dB bandwidth of 1.3%.8  
High-harmonic gyro-TWT amplifiers have also been developed to allow high-frequency 
operation at reduced magnetic field requirement. The electron beam interacts with a 
higher-order waveguide mode at a high cyclotron harmonic by properly matching the 
resonance condition, then the required magnetic field strength can be reduced by a factor of 
the harmonic number. A proof of principle experiment has demonstrated the amplification of 
the  mode at the eighth harmonic.81TE
9 At UCD, a second harmonic TE  gyro-TWT 
experiment produced a saturated peak power of 207 kW, a saturated gain of 16 dB and a 
saturated bandwidth of 2.1 % in the Ku-band.
21
10 The experiment also verified the theoretical 
prediction that the second harmonic gyro-TWT can be more stable to oscillations due to 
weaker harmonic interactions and can generate high powers than the fundamental harmonic 
gyro-TWT. 
Most of the harmonic gyro-TWTs developed in the past have used either cylindrical or 
rectangular waveguides as interaction structures.2-10 The characteristics of a harmonic 
gyro-TWT with a coaxial interaction waveguide have still seldom been studied. However, 
problems of mode competition in a high-power gyrotron oscillator have been reduced using 
coaxial structures in recent years. The coaxial-waveguide gyro-TWT may be suitable for high 
power and broad bandwidth operation in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave ranges. 
Recently, several studies have analyzed the performance and stability of the 
fundamental-harmonic coaxial gyro-TWT. A TE  coaxial gyro-TWT was predicted to 
achieve a gain of 67 dB at a frequency of 140 GHz.
16,28
11 A  coaxial gyro-TWT with 
distributed-loss structure was predicted to stably generate 435 kW in the Ka-band with 31%

 provides another mechanism for improving the stability of the coaxial gyro-TWT. The 
eigenvalue mnχ  (= ) of a TE  mode is a function of C  (Fig. 3) for a coaxial 
structure, where  satisfies the equation

k ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0=′′−′′ bkYakakYbkJ mnmmnmnmmnm J m , and 
 and Y  are the first and second kind of Bessel function of order m, respectively. If a 
different  value is chosen, the 
mJ m
C zk−ω  diagram of the second-harmonic coaxial gyro-TWT 
will differ from that at =1.9, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Instabilities will occur at 
different intersections of the waveguide mode and synchronism lines, and the stability of the 
coaxial gyro-TWT is altered by choosing the  value. Therefore, the geometrical parameter 
 will be varied in the later analysis to determine its effect on the start-oscillation current of 
the likely oscillating modes.

When the parameter  is varied, the cutoff frequency  of the operating TE  
mode is always 88.7932 GHz (corresponds to = 18.6097) to keep the operating point 
(point 1 in Fig. 1) unchanged. The outer radius  for a given  value is then determined 
from the eigenvalue 
C 02
(= k ) of the operating TE  mode in Fig. 3. After the outer 
radius  is determined, the guiding center radius  is chosen to yield strong coupling 
strength of the beam/wave interaction for the operating mode. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the

negative-  mode in Fig. 1) is dominated by a backward-wave component. The axial field 
profile of the  mode is formed with comparable forward and backward components 
since the intersection in Fig. 1 is near its cutoff frequency. The  mode is excited at the 
highest normalized frequency  (which corresponds to a largest , as shown in Fig. 1) 
and is the lowest-order mode among the four modes, so it has the smallest attenuation
