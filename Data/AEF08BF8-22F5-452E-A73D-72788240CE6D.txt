計畫中文摘要
關鍵詞： 有機薄膜雷射，奈米壓印
由於有機發光元件具有可撓性特質，在下一世代的顯示產業中，備受矚目。而有機薄
膜雷射雖然並不是光源的主要來源，但是雷射特有的聚焦傳播及高色純度，加上有機材料
發光頻譜的寬廣，使得有機薄膜雷射佔有一個特殊的地位，雖然電激發光更具吸引力，但
由於偏振子耦合等問題，用光激發的可行性較高，我們希望設計多彩的有機薄雷射，以建
議一種可撓式雷射顯示的可能性。
96 年關於光激發有機薄膜雷射的研究，利用 DCJTB/PVK 的混合系統成功的觀測到 620
nm 的紅光輸出，對於發光的原理部份也有初步的了解，因此我們繼續朝短波長的研究方向
進行，藍光的有機雷射成功的完成，不同結構以及不同的有機薄膜介質的分析也有一定成
果，但在嘗試以單一光子晶體結構發出多重波長時，由於有機材料的要求非常高，初期遇
上瓶頸，但終於找到適當組合而順利克服，成功完成了薄膜元件發出紅與藍兩種顏色的雷
射。並於過程中研發出雙重奈米壓印的技術，有助於降低量產時的成本。
計畫英文摘要
Keywords：Organic Thin-film Lasers, Nano-imprint
Because of the possibility to be constructed on flexible substrates, organic light emitting
devices have been one of the research focal areas in the next-generation display industry.
Researches regarding organic thin-film lasers are blooming due to laser properties, such as easy
focusing and high color saturation. Electrical pumped organic lasers are particularly attracting,
although the research in this area has been disappointing for the last decade. Without the
troublesome polaron effect, optical pumped organic thin-film lasers have been reported recently.
However, the theory behind the lasing mechanism and reported output power are not satisfactory.
We propose to study optical pumped organic lasers. We plan to start marking patterns of
DFB structure or 2-dimensional photonic crystal structure in later part of this project by e-beam
writing or nano imprint, experimentally, to construct the lasing cavity. For the gain medium, we
will mix small light-emitting organic molecules in the polymer host to prevent the damage from
the water and oxygen in the environment. We also consider using the absorption property of the
host polymer to excite the small molecule through the energy-transfer process. The pumping
source will be the second harmonic or the third harmonic of a nano-second Nd:YAG laser.
After successfully providing the proto-type of blue surface-emitting organic lasers, we
further studied the emitting properties of the blue organic materials and the effect of different
structure symmetries on the lasing characteristics. Using single rectangular photonic crystal
structure with proper side lengths and a correct recipe of organic compound mixture, dual-color,
red (612 nm) and blue (449 nm) emission has been successfully demonstrated. To reduce the cost
of the fabrication process if mass production is interested, we also developed a novice technology
called double nano-imprint lithography.

The gain medium is prepared by PTT doped in polymers, Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) of
M.W. 90,000, PVK of M.W. 1,100,000, or Polycarbonate (PC) of M.W. 64,000. Solvent is
chloroform. The pumping wavelength was 355 nm. Hence, we should double check the polymers
have lower absorption to 460 nm and PPT doped in PVK with chloroform show higher
absorption than in polycarbonate at 355 nm. The absorption spectrum and emission spectra are
showed in Fig. 2.1, and Fig. 2.2, respectively.

highest gain coefficient, we measure PPT:PVK(M.W. 90,000) with more weight percentages.
Comparing gain coefficient, we observe 7 wt% is the best concentration. In a summery, we select

2.3 Technology development
the fabrication of PhCs often requires elaborate and expensive techniques, such as
electron-beam lithography. To mass producing PhC structures, several patterning methods have
been developed. For example, nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technique has been used to
fabricate 2D photonic crystals for enhanced light extraction [12].

4 g is the gain coefficient.
7on the organic thin-film structure at a slating angle of 450. The surface emitted light was
collected by a fiber-coupled CCD spectrometer to produce the emission spectra. Fig. 2.7 shows
the two lasing peaks are 454.8 nm and 458 nm, corresponding to the 290 nm side and the 300 nm
side of the rectangular lattice, respectively. The stronger emission at 454.8 nm was due to higher
material gain of PFO. The FWHM of the 454.8 nm emission peak is 2.2 nm and the one of the
458 nm emission peak is 1.8 nm due to the limitation on the dynamic range of the CCD
spectrometer. The pumping energy threshold of 454.8 nm lasing peak is 0.40 μJ and the one of 
458 nm lasing peak is 0.57 μJ as shown in Fig. 2.8.

pumping fluence in PhCs laser

We put a lossy linear polarizer in front of the fiber and observed the emission intensity at
different rotation angle. Fig. 2.9 (a) and (b) show orthogonal linear polarization behavior of the
458 nm emission and the 454.8 nm emission, respectively, comparing to Fig. 2.7. This
phenomenon is expected, since these two emission peaks are corresponding to orthogonal sides of
the rectangular lattice. This effect can also be observed from the horizontal and vertical far-field
emission patterns shown in Fig. 2.10.

2.4 Structure designs
Bragg diffraction can explain the coupling mechanism of waves in photonic crystal. In this
section, we’l simply introduce the theory of Bragg difraction and then explain how these saddle 
9nm, the direction of propagation wave is Γ-K.
The hexagonal regions are the tiled first Brillouin zones in Fig. 2.11 (a). The incident wave
of MI is the vector from Γ to M in the first Brilouin zone(Fig. 2.11 (a)). In order to satisfy the
constant frequency condition, we can plot a sphere which center is Γ point and radius is the 
magnitude of the incident wave. In other words, whatever results after we calculate, the
diffraction waves that can couple with incident wave are always on the surface of the sphere. The
section of the sphere on x-y plane is a circle. In Fig. 2.11 (a), it is clear to see that the diffraction
occurs only in the reverse direction on the sphere. We can use the same method to find the
diffraction wave at others points. In order to verify the Bragg diffraction theory, we simulated the
structure by FDTD method with RSoft5. We can compare the figures of FDTD with wave-vector
diagram of Bragg diffraction theory. By observing Fig. 2.11 (b), (c), it is clear that the diffraction
wave coupler with reverse direction. This result matches with Fig. 2.11(a).

In Fig. 2.13 (d), there are coupling waves which satisfy the conditions shown in Fig. 2.13
(a). By analyzing Fig. 2.13 (a) with Bragg diffraction, we know that the coupling waves of MII
point divide into three parts and each part is independent to each other. In other words, one side
of triangular lattice in real space constructs one part of coupling system in reciprocal lattice. In
order to verify this hypothesis we design the isosceles triangular lattice to prove. Fig. 2.14 (a) is
an isosceles triangular lattice in real space, and Fig. 2.14 (b) is the wave-vector diagram at MII
point in the reciprocal lattice.

2.5 Results and discussion
Part 1. Red emission
We use the organic dye DCJTB doped in the matrix of PVK as the gain medium. The
organic thin-film laser with 2D photonic crystal is made by spin casting an organic thin film onto
a 2D photonic crystal structure with triangular lattice fabricated by E-beam lithography and dry
etching.
1. We used spin-casting process to coat the photoresist on the SiO2 substrate and then
electron beam lithography was employed to write patterns. Through development
the mask we needed could be obtained. The reactive ion etching was utilized to get
pattern on SiO2 and then removed the photoresist. The pattern on SiO2 with total
region of 2.32*2.20 mm2 is shown in Fig. 2.17 (a). The E-beam firstly wrote from
the top of lift-hand side of Fig. 2.17 (a) and the SEM image shown in Fig. 2.17 (b).
When finished a block of 462.5 *441.2 μm2, the E-beam shifted to the lift and
continue writing until the 25 blocks is done. The triangular lattice of circular holes
has lattice constant of 4005 nm and diameter of 3055 nm shown in Fig. 18 (a)
and (b). The etching depth is 107 nm measured by AFM shown in Fig. 18 (c)
2. The organic solution was prepared by PVK with M.W. 90000 dissolving into
chloroform approximately at 3% by weight. Doping concentration of DCJTB in the
PVK matrix is 3%, also. Spin-casting process was employed to form the organic
thin-film with thickness of 470 nm (measured by Dektak 3030ST) on the patterned
SiO2 substrate.

The lasing experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2.19. The 2D-DFB structure coating with
organic thin-film was pumped by a Q-switched second harmonic generated Nd: YAG laser
(Quantel Ultra CFR) with =532 nm. The hot mirror was used to reflect the propagation wave
of =1064 nm (R> 95 % @ 1064 nm) from Nd: YAG laser and let the wave of =532 nm pass
(T> 92 % @ 532 nm). Energy of each pulse was controlled by a half waveplate and a polarizer.
We utilized a convex lens (f = 15 cm) to focus the beam onto the 2D-DFB structure. The surface
emitting light was collected by a fiber-coupled CCD spectrometer (CDI Spec 32) to produce the
emission spectrum. The focusing beam shape on the 2D-DFB structure is an ellipse with long
axis length of 153μm and short axis length of 123μmshown in Fig. 2.20. This shape was caused
by maximum laser energy and left the permanent damage on structure.

of long axis length of 153μm and short axis length of 123μmwas caused by
maximum laser energy and left the permanent damage on structure.
Fig. 2.21 shows the emission spectrum at different pumping energy with λpeak = 621 nm. As
the pumping energy increases, the emission spectra get narrowed and grow rapidly. We plot the (a)
output intensity and (b) FWHM of Fig. 2.21 depending on different pumping energy shown in Fig.
2.22. It is apparent that when the pumping energy was at 4.67 μJ, the output intensity suddenly
grew rapidly and lasing phenomenon was observed. Furthermore as pumping energy was higher
than 6.89μJ, the saturation occurred that can be deduced from the output intensity in Fig. 2.21 (b)
and the FWHM of the spectrum widths in Fig. 2.22.

photonic crystal structure with triangular lattice fabricated by E-beam lithography and dry etching.
The lattice constant is 405 5 nm with air holes of radius 150 5 nm. Lasing phenomenon is
observed at threshold pumping energy of 6.7 μJ at the peak wavelength of 621 nm. The FWHM is
indicated as 4.22 nm due to the limitation on the dynamic range of the CCD spectrometer. The
calculated band diagram of lasing action at the peak wavelength of 622 nm shows good
agreement with measured wavelength of 621 nm.
Part 2. Blue emission
The experimental results and discussions are presented in this section. There were five
structures which was designed for emitting 460 nm in our experiment; the first structure is the
triangular lattice with lattice constant of 300 nm and the diameter of 206 nm and it was
corresponded to MII point; the second structure was also designed at MII point but its diameter
was 172 nm, in order to understand the power of effect with the diameter in photonic crystals;
The third structure was the triangular lattice with lattice constant of 349 nm and the diameter of
284 nm and it was coresponded to Γ point; The fourth structure was the triangular latice with 
lattice constant of 405 nm and the diameter of 306 nm and it was corresponded to KII point; the
final structure was the isosceles triangular lattice which designed to proof the hypothesis which
explains that one side of triangular lattice in real space constructs one part of coupling system in
reciprocal lattice at MII point. The isosceles triangular lattice possessed lattice constant of 300
nm, 321 nm and diameter of 227 nm. All the information is listed in the following table.

In this case, we spin-coated PPT doped in PVK of M.W. 90,000 with 7 wt% as the active
layer on structure I and the thickness of thin film was controlled to be about 375 nm. Figure 4.19
shows the emission spectrum with diferent pumping energy and λpeak=445.2 nm. Increasing the
pumping energy would make the emission spectra get narrowed and grow rapidly. We plot the
output intensity and FWHM of Fig. 2.23 depending on different pumping energy shown in Fig.

with the same thickness.

Fig. 2.25 shows the emission spectrum with different pumping energy at λpeak=443.2 nm.
Increasing the pumping energy would also make the emission spectra get narrowed and grow
rapidly. We plot the output intensity and FWHM of Fig. 2.25 depending on different pumping
energy shown in Fig. 2.26 (a) and (b), respectively. The FWHM of spectra can narrow to 4.2 nm
when the device operates above the threshold energy.

Structure IV
In this case, we spin-coated PPT doped in PVK of M.W. 90,000 with 7wt% as the active
layer on structure IV and the thickness of thin film was controlled to be about 375 nm. Fig. 2.29
shows the emission spectrum with different pumping energy. It is apparent that there is no lasing
phenomenon occurring at KII point.
Fig. 2.29 Emission spectra of a thin film of PPT doped in PVK of M.W. 90,000 with 7wt% on
structure IV under different pumping fluence.
Structure V
In this case, we spin-coated PPT doped in PVK of M.W. 90,000 with 7wt% as active layer
on structure V and the thickness of thin film was controlled to be about 375 nm. Figure 13 shows
the emission spectrum with different pumping energy at λpeak=455.8 nm. Increasing the pumping
energy would make the emission spectra get narrowed and grow rapidly. We plot the output
intensity and FWHM of Fig. 2.30 depending on different pumping energy shown in Fig. 2.31. It
is easy to observe that the output intensity suddenly grows rapidly when the pumping fluence is
upon 0.456 μJ/pulse and lasing phenomenon is observed. The FWHM of spectra can narrow to 
3.2 nm when the device operates above the threshold energy. In this experiment, we know that if
one side of the isosceles triangular lattice conforms to design, the structure can lase.

materials. Fig. 33 only presents the band structure at B1 & B2. The organic solution was
spin-coated on the PhC substrate to form a thin film with thickness of 350 nm.

Fig. 33 The band diagram for the blue emission
Optical excitation was provided by a pulsed Q-switched frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser.
FWHM of the pulse width was around 7 ns and repetition rate was 5 Hz. The pumping laser beam
was focused to a 300 μm diameter spot on the organic thin-film structure at a tilt angle of 450.
The surface emitted light was collected by a fiber-coupled CCD spectrometer (CDI Spec 32) to
produce the emission spectra shown in Fig. 34. The phenomenon of dual color emission is
observed. Two peak wavelengths at 444.29 nm and 612.26 nm show good agreement to the
calculated emission wavelengths 445.67 nm and 614.21 nm, respectively, based on the band
diagram. The relationship between the emission intensity and the pumping energy are shown in
Fig. 35. The slope efficiencies are similar for both blue and red emission while the pumping
threshold energy for red emission at 0.109 uJ is lower than the one for blue emission at 0.125 uJ.
Since we expected that TE mode of the blue emission was oscillated vertically (configured as in
Fig. 1) and TE mode of the red emission was oscillated horizontally, the emission should possess
polarization characteristics accordingly. We indeed observed orthogonal polarization of the blue
and red emissions as shown in Fig. 36 (a) (0o) and (b) (90o).
