兩群體區別分析(Discriminant Analysis)的樣本重疊部分是錯誤分類主要來

Abstract
The overlap of sample between two groups may result in misclassification in
two-group discriminant analysis. Chang et al. (2005) proposed a novel procedure
based on symmetric stratified data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, with the
features of nonparametric and nonlinear discriminant functions, to classify the
objects within overlap effectively. However, when the proportion of objects in
both groups is significantly different and the cost of type-I error is extremely
higher than type-II error’s (such as the cases of disease diagnosis and bankruptcy
analysis), the symmetric stratified DEA procedure tended to have the upward
biases towards the larger sample size group. In this study, therefore, we will
address an asymmetric stratified DEA model to further improve the discriminant
accuracy by incorporated with the expected misclassification cost as the criteria
of performance evaluation.
Keywords: Discriminant analysis, Misclassification cost, Data envelopment analysis
(Eisenbeis, 1977; Dimitras et al., 1995, 1996). These conventional statistical methods,
however, have some restrictive assumptions such as the linearity, normality and
independence among predictor variables. But the violation of these assumptions for
independent variables frequently occurs with financial data (Deakin, 1976); therefore
the methods will have limitations to obtain the effectiveness and validity. There are
several methods proposed to overcome some disadvantages of the discriminant
analysis and to provide higher prediction accuracy. Such as the study of Ohlson (1980)
using logit analysis and the study of Zmijewski (1984) using probit analysis; Frydman
et al. (1985) first employed the recursive partitioning algorithm while Gupta et al.
(1990) used mathematical programming methods for the business failure prediction
problem. Other methods used were survival analysis by Luoma and Laitinen (1991),
expert systems by Messier and Hansen (1988), neural networks by Altman et al.
(1994). The recent studies in artificial neural networks (ANNs) show that ANNs are
powerful tool for pattern recognition and pattern classification due to their nonlinear
nonparametric adaptive-learning properties. Tam and Kiang (1992), Wilson and
Sharda (1994), Lacher et al. (1995), and Sharda and Wilson (1996) report that ANNs
produce significantly better prediction accuracy than classical statistical techniques.
However, it has been commonly reported that ANNs model requires a large amount of
training data to estimate the distribution of input pattern, and have difficulties of
and bankrupt classes are established by the benchmarks, which were identified by
DEA model. The basic idea was inspired by the fact that observations belonging to the
same class should be dominated by the same benchmarks. The benchmarks of each
class (non-bankruptcy or bankruptcy) can construct a piecewise frontier to dominate a
convexity class. For the purpose of classification, the frontier of non-bankrupt class is
constructed by the worst companies, which were identified by DEA model as the
benchmarks based on how efficient they are at being bad. Consequently, companies
dominated by these benchmarks are evaluated as inefficient ones and regarded safer
than the benchmarks to become bankrupt. On the contrary, the boundary of
bankruptcy is established by picking out the best companies to be as benchmarks
which are identified based on how efficient they are at being good, that is, the
benchmarks will have more opportunities than the dominated companies to become
non-bankrupt ones. There might be companies dominated by both frontiers, it
represents the existing of overlap. TypeⅠ (misclassify a health company as failure)
and Type errorsⅡ (misclassify a failure company as health) may occur. Therefore, an
asymmetric stratified DEA model that is a layering technique is applied to reduce and
ultimately eliminate the overlap to establish the separating hyperplanes for the two
classes. The major merit of the proposed approach is that, the nonlinear separating
hyperplanes can be established easily by the frontiers of the two classes without the

DEA model classifies DMUs on the frontier as efficient and DMUs enveloped by the
frontier as inefficient. Thus, the benchmarks are the best performers on the frontier,
and the poor performers are furthest away from the frontier. In this article, instead of
aiming at picking out the good performers, the frontier of non-bankrupt class is
established by identifying the worst performers to be benchmarks. This is achieved by
selecting variables that reflect bad to perform. The strategy is to pick output variables
that reflect poor utilization of resources, or are undesirable outcomes, such as working
capital and debt. Input variables are selected such as profits, sales and equity that are
the more the worse for a bad performer. The companies identified to construct the
frontier of non-bankrupt class are those companies (as the points A, B, C, shown in
Figure 1(a)) with the lowest of inputs (profits, sales, et al.) while having the highest
level of the outputs (working capital, debt, et al.).
The frontier of bankrupt class is established based on a general DEA model to
identify the best performers (as the points D, E, F, shown in Figure 1(b)). It is
(1)
the same production possibility set (PPS) and will be classified to the same class. Two
PPSs of 1G and 2G might have intersection (

shown in Figure 2), it means some companies or DMUs dominated by the frontiers of
1G and 2G simultaneously, which may result in misclassification. That is, if 1G
and
2G
 are the efficiency scores of newDMU evaluated separately by the
variable-benchmarks of 1G and 2G , there are four possible situations:

Situation (iii) indicates the intersection between two PPSs because newDMU is
dominated by the benchmarks of 1G and 2G simultaneously. In order to establish a
general discriminant rule that company can be classified as a designated class if it was
dominated only by a correspondent frontier, the stratification model (Zhu, 2003) was
further applied to deal with the overlap problem.

symmetric layering technique that is suitable to an even number of observations. For
the bankruptcy prediction, remove a layer of frontier from non-bankrupt class will
raise the risk of Type errorⅠ because the reduction of PPS range. If the frontier being
removed is from bankrupt class, it will then increase the risk of Type Ⅱ error.
Generally, the cost of Type Ⅱ error is much more expensive than Type error. InⅠ
order to minimize the total cost of Type and TypeⅠ Ⅱ errors, an asymmetric layering
technique is performed by incorporating the error costs and risk rates into the
expected cost of misclassification (ECM) function to identify a pair of frontiers that
can minimize the misclassification cost. That is:
     21 21211212min pPcpPcECM 
Where  12c is the cost of Type error andⅠ  21c means the cost of Type error.Ⅱ
 12P and  21P are the risk rates of Type and Type errorsⅠ Ⅱ , which are
calculated with the accumulative benchmarks number on the removed frontiers being
divided by total amount of DMUs in the corresponding class. The more frontiers
removed from the PPSs result in the larger risk of Type Ⅰ or Type errors.Ⅱ The
ratios of 1p and 2p are the proportions of non-bankrupt and bankrupt companies.
There are several combinations on the two sets of benchmarks (notated as *1E
and *2E ) that can dominate two PPSs having no intersection between them

In this article, we considered 1996 data to be as training samples for model
developing and 1997 data as holdout samples for validation purposes. There have
been several studies aiming at identifying the most important indicators for
bankruptcy prediction (Beaver, 1966; Altman, 1993; Deakin, 1976; Edminster, 1972;
Ward, 1995), from which some indicators of failure companies were found having
significantly different values than those of healthy companies. In this article, the
variables of total assets (TA), earnings before income, tax, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA), total current liabilities (CL), interest expense (IN) and cash
flow from operations (CF) were examined to be different significantly between
bankrupt and non-bankrupt classes and then selected as discriminant factors.
In order to identify the worst performers to establish the boundary for non-bankrupt
class, those DUMs with the highest output level of total assets (TA), total current
liabilities (CL) and interest expense (IN) while having the lowest input level of
earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and cash flow
(CF), will be identified as benchmarks. The same variables were used for bankrupt
class by replacing the input variables as output and output as input to identify the best
performers. Because negative value is usual for some financial variables, in order to
satisfy the positive restriction in DEA model, any one of the selected factors taking on
a negative value needs add an adequate positive constant value to the factor value of
are different between two classes. Removing a layer of frontier from bankrupt class
bring much more risk (Type Ⅱ errors) than from non-bankruptcy (Type errorⅠ s),
because the first layer of removed frontier causes only 1.25% risk in non-bankruptcy
(Type errorⅠ s) but 10.53% in bankruptcy (Type Ⅱ errors).
<<Insert Table 1>>
<<Insert Table 2>>
There are eight collocations of pair frontiers making no intersection between two
PPSs of non-bankrupt and bankrupt classes. To identify the optimal pair of frontiers to
be as separating hyperplanes, formula (5) is solved in accordance with different error
risks and costs caused from each collocation to minimize expected cost of
misclassification. The ratio of Type Ⅱ cost to Type Ⅰcost (  21c /  12c ) is assumed
from 1 to 1 to 20 to 1 for the situation of different applications. Table 3 shows NB-2
and B-7 are the best choice if ignores the influence of error cost (that is, assume
 21c /  12c equal to 1). For which, only 1.25% of healthy companies (the
benchmarks on the first layer of frontier, see Table 1) are removed from the
non-bankrupt class, but 78.95% of failed companies (the benchmarks removed from
layer one to layer six, see Table 2) need to be removed from the bankrupt class
article is to solve the discriminant problem with uneven cost of error risk and uneven
observations. Ttherefore, frontiers NB-2 and B-7 are uncertainly the best solution if
the cost rate of Type Ⅰand Type Ⅱ errors is greater than one. Table 4 shows that
hit-ratio and misclassification cost trade off to each other if the proportion of Type Ⅱ
to Type Ⅰcost is greater than 10, that is, a higher hit-ratio will accompany with a
greater misclassification cost. Therefore, although the hit-ratio of training sample is
only 34.92% and holdout is 31.94%, the frontiers of NB-21 and B-1 were determined
the best separating hyperplanes for bankruptcy prediction because they can cause the
minimized expected misclassification cost (as shown in Table 4).
<<Insert Table 4>>
4. Conclusion
This article introduces an asymmetric-stratified DEA approach, which establishes the
nonlinear discriminant functions by the benchmarks of non-bankrupt and bankrupt
classes. Instead of evaluating the prediction capability by hit-ratio that tended to have
upward biases towards the larger class (non-bankruptcy) to improve the performance
of discrimination, the proposed approach establishes the discriminant functions by
minimizing the total expected misclassification cost (EMC). Generally, the risk of
TypeⅠerror. If the proportion of Type Ⅱ to TypeⅠcost is greater than 10, hit-ratio
and misclassification cost trade off to each other. When the cost ratio of two errors is
assumed 20 to 1 as the ratio documented by Altman (1993) and Hull (1998), the
separating hyperplanes of frontiers NB-21 and B-1 were determined the best solution
to prevent the appearance of Type Ⅱ error to minimize expected misclassification
cost, although the hit-ratio of training data is only 34.92% and holdout is 31.94%.
Therefore, by incorporating different errors cost and risks into the procedure, the
proposed benchmark approach can easily establish more than one separating
hyperplanes and provide flexibility to decision makers for credit evaluation and
bankruptcy prediction.
