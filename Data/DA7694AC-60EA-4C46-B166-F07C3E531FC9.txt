Abstract 
    Much literature has provided the 
methods to prevent from the occupational 
injuries about manual material handling 
(MMH), but little research investigates the 
energy efficiency of manual material handling. 
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to 
investigate the effects of “combination of 
weight and frequency” and box size on energy 
efficiency and various physiology responses. 
Sixteen young men joined this study. The 
independent variables of the lifting 
experiment are box size (big and small) and 
combination of weight and frequency (12 kg & 
2 lift/min, 8 kg & 3 lift/min, 6kg & 4 lift/min, 
4kg & 6 lift/min ). Dependent variables are 
oxygen consumption, energy efficiency, heart 
rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, 
body temperature, and RPE. Three are 8 trials 
of lifting experiment, 16 min tasks. Subjects 
had to fill the form of RPE scale after each 
trial. We also measured their body 
temperature, systolic pressure and diastolic 
before and after each trial. Heart rate would 
collected during the lifting experiment. 
The results indicated the combination of 
weight and frequency had significant effect on 
RPE. When the weight of box increased, RPE 
also increased. Some results of physical 
fitness tests have positive correlation with the 
physiology responses. We could give some 
suggestions for selecting the lifting workers 
from the results. The study found RPE has 
significantly positive correlation with LI 
(lifting index). We could use RPE to 
determine safety limit for MMH. This study 
provided useful information for designing 
lifting tasks, and also assisted in elevating the 
energy efficiency of MMH. 
Keywords:lifting; physiology; energy 
efficiency; physical work.

ABSTRACT 
The use of digital projectors is becoming more popular, but studies about visual fatigue of digital projector 
users are rare. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of illumination and viewing 
distance on the digital projector user’s visual fatigue. Each experimental trial took 40 min, including a 10-
min proofreading task and a 30-min film watching task. The critical flicker frequency (CFF) and ratings of 
visual fatigue were measured in each trial. The results indicated that viewing distance had a significant 
effect on both accuracy rate (p=0.022) and change in CFF (p=0.039). Besides, illumination had a significant 
effect on both attention rate (p=0.047) and change in CFF (p=0.038). The viewing distance ´ illumination 
interaction was not statistically significant on all the measures. A higher attention rate (about 10% greater) 
was found at the brighter illumination levels (450 and 750 lx) compared to the average attention rate for the 
darker illumination levels (75 and 200 lx). There was a significant decrease in the visual fatigue with 
increasing viewing distance. But, a tendency to a reduced accuracy rate was found with increasing 
viewing distance.

INTRODUCTION 
Since the rapid development of digital science and technology, the usage of digital projectors has 
increased immensely – both in schools and companies. More and more people rely on digital projectors to 
present, brief, teach, or see a film. But when it is used in a room, a decrease in ambient illumination may be 
required to get a clear picture on the projection screen. Darker ambient illumination may have a negative 
minutes of arc at the viewing distance of 3, 6, and 9 m, respectively. 
The illumination was within-subject factor, while viewing distance was between-subjects factor. 
Thirty participants were randomly divided into three groups and each group had 10 persons. 
Ten subjects were randomly assigned to each of the three levels of the between-subjects 
factor, viewing distance. Every subject randomly completed the four treatments (75, 200, 450, 
and 750 lx) of the within-subject factor on four different days. 
Figure 1 shows the workplace arrangement in the experiment. The digital projector was 
positioned on a table 76 cm in height. The horizontal distance from the projection screen to the 
lens of the projector was 240 cm. The elevation angle of the projector base was 11 degree 
with respect to the table surface. There were six subjects performing the experimental tasks at 
the same time. The distances from the projection screen to the subject’s eyes for the front, 
middle, and last seats were 3, 6, and 9 m, respectively. The subjects were forbidden to adjust 
their seating positions to keep their viewing distance constant during the experiment. The used 
work table was 76 cm high, 50 cm wide and 199 cm long. The ambient illumination was 
produced by 6 lamp stands, which were placed beside the tables. The color temperature of 
each bulb was about 6500 K. The self-made lampshades were used to adjust the illumination 
level on the table according to the experimental treatments (75, 200, 450, and 750 lx). No 
glare appeared on both of the projection screen and the tables.

Experimental Tasks and procedure 
Each subject should perform four experimental trials (with 75, 200, 450, and 750 lx 
illumination) on four different days. Each experimental trial comprised two visual tasks: 
proofreading for 10 minutes and watching a film for 30 minutes. Four different articles for 
proofreading tasks were made by the Microsoft Power Point program. These articles were 
similar and randomly assigned to the four experimental treatments. Each article had a simple 
story and would display on the continuous 60 slides. The text was set to be the Standard K 
 
Data analysis 
Microsoft Excel and SPSS 10.0 were used for the data analysis. All the dependent variables 
were described as mean values with their standard deviations (SD). The inferential statistics of 
ANOVA was used to evaluate the effects of illumination, viewing distance, and their 
interaction on the dependent variables. Statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05. The 
Duncun’s treatment contrast tests were used for post-hoc comparisons if the effect of 
between-subjects factor was significant. 
 
RESULTS 
The mean and standard deviation values for the accuracy rate, attention rate, @CFF, and 
visual fatigue rating under each level of the independent variables are shown in Table 1. A 
higher attention rate (about 10% greater) was found at the brighter illumination levels (450 and 
750 lx) compared to the average attention rate for the darker illumination levels (75 and 200 
lx). The decrease in CFF was greatest for 200 lx (-2.28 Hz), followed by 450 lx (-1.80 Hz), 
75 lx (-1.53 Hz), and 750 lx (-1.20 Hz). The mean accuracy rates (0.65~0.66) and ratings of 
visual fatigue (3.23~3.53) didn’t differ significantly under the four levels of illumination. 
There was a tendency to a reduced accuracy rate in the proofreading task with increasing 
viewing distance. The accuracy rates were 0.75, 0.64, and 0.57 for the viewing distances 3 m, 
6 m, and 9 m, respectively. Besides, there was also an obviously decrease in the @CFF with 
increasing viewing distance. The mean @CFF values were -2.36 Hz, -1.53 Hz, and -1.23 Hz 
for the viewing distances 3 m, 6 m, and 9 m, respectively. The mean attention rates 
(0.73~0.79) and ratings of visual fatigue (3.13~3.50) didn’t differ significantly under the three 
levels of viewing distance.

The summary of the ANOVA results (Table 2) indicated that viewing distance had a significant 
effect on both accuracy rate (p=0.022) and @CFF (p=0.039). Besides, illumination had a 
significant effect on both attention rate (p=0.047) and @CFF (p=0.038). The interaction

dependent variables. 
 
angle of character height. This obtained suitable visual angle of the Chinese character height in 
using the digital projector was in line with the previous studies for reading from the VDTs 
[6][8]. 
 
CONCLUSION 
For enhancing audience’s attention in watching the projection screen, the local illumination on 
user’s work area was recommended to be 450~750 lx. At visual angle of 25 min of arc, user 
might exhibit adequate visual performance and not lead to great visual fatigue as watching the 
projection text. This study indicated that whatever viewing distance or local illumination, the 
subjects have a sign of visual fatigue after watching the projection screen for 40 min. A short 
break may be required to recover the visual function after using the digital projector for 40 min. 
This study suggested that there may exits similar suitable local illumination and visual angle in 
using the digital projector and using the VDTs to read Chinese text. More studies should be 
conducted to confirm whether the previous recommendations, such as contrast, color and 
brightness of text and background, for using VDTs can also be applied in using digital 
projectors.
