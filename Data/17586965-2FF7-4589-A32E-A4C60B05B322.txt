Abstract 
  In this research project, we consider the 
problem of synthesizing anti-windup low-order 
controllers for a given system in the presence 
of actuator saturation and exogenous energy-
bounded disturbance. In particular, the 
controller structure of PID type is considered. 
The sufficient conditions for achieving output 
performance and disturbance attenuation are 
given in terms of the multi-objective H∞  
specifications. The results from the earlier 
works on parameter-based PID synthesis are 
then used to solve the resulting multi-objective 
H∞  PID design problem. The set of the 
admissible controller parameters can be 
determined constructively using linear-
programming techniques. The proposed 
synthesis method is then used to design an anti-
windup PID controller for the position control 
of a DC servomotor system and the 
experimental results are presented to show 
effectiveness of the proposed method. 
 
Keywords: anti-windup; low-order control; 
H∞  control; actuator saturation; disturbance 
attenuation; servo control 
 
1.  Motivation and Objective 
 
  All physical control systems are subject to 
actuator saturation. If the control signal 
saturates, the signal from the controller differs 
from that enters the plant. Any slow or unstable 
modes in the controller will result in undesired 
effects on the response for a substantial time 
after the actuators have returned from 
saturation such that the closed-loop 
performance will significantly deteriorate 
(large overshoot, oscillation, limit circle or 
even instability). This phenomenon is referred 
to as windup. Windup has been originally 
observed and discussed in PI/PID control [1]-
[5]. Anti-windup refers to a class of control 
schemes that minimize the undesirable effects 
of the saturation constraints on the closed-loop 
performance. The most popular anti-windup 
schemes [6]-[15] are based on a two-step 
design procedure where a linear controller is 
first synthesized by ignoring the input 
nonlinearities and then augment an anti-windup 
compensation to reduce the effects caused by 
windup. Based on this design methodology, 
many anti-windup compensator synthesis 
problems [8]-[15] were cast into the H∞  
framework and computational techniques are 
available for control system synthesis with

PID controller parameters are the proportional 
gain pk , integral gain ik , derivative gain dk , 
derivative filter time constant T, and anti-
windup compensator constant tT . The idea of 
this back-calculation technique is to mitigate 
the effects of the integrator continuing to 
integrate due to the nonlinear saturation effect. 
The difference between actuator input and 
output is fed back to the integrator through the 
constant gain 1
tT
. As soon as saturation occurs, 
this signal becomes non-zero and prevents the 
integrator from winding up. The objective here 
is to determine the controller gain values 
( , , )p i dk k k  and the anti-windup compensator 
constant tT  such that the following design 
criteria are satisfied: 
(i) the closed-loop system is asymptotically 
stable; 
(ii) with zero initial conditions, the L2 gain 
from the command input ( )r t  and the 
disturbance input ( )d t  to the control 
error ( )e t  is less than or equal to 1, i.e.,

define the H∞  optimization criteria to be:

where ( )W s  is a stable frequency-dependent 
weighting function. Moreover, denote the 
weighting function ( )( )( ) nd

W sW s = , where ( )nW s  
and ( )dW s  are coprime polynomials. In [23]-
[25], it was shown that the H∞  PID synthesis 
problem can be reduced to simultaneous 
stabilization of the closed-loop characteristic 
polynomial and a family of complex 
polynomials as follows: 
 
Lemma 4.1 [23]-[25] For a given 0γ > , there 
exist PID gain values ( , , )d p ik k k  such that 
( ) ( , , , )cl p i dW s T s k k k γ∞ <  if and only if the 
following conditions hold:

γ⎡ ⎤+⎣ ⎦  is 
Hurwitz for all θ in [0, 2 )π ; 
(3) (0) (0, , , )cl p i dW T k k k γ< . 
 
With a fixed θ, both polynomials in conditions 
(1) and (2) are in the form of 
2( , , , ) ( ) ( ) ( )p i d d p is k k k T s k s k s k U sδ = + + +  
 (4.3) 
where ( )T s  and ( )U s  are some given 
complex polynomials. In [23]-[25], a linear-
programming-based synthesis procedure was 
provided for determining all stabilizing 
( , , )p i dk k k  values, if any, for which (4.3) is 
Hurwitz. In particular, it was shown that for a 
fixed pk , the stabilizing ( , )i dk k  values are 
the feasible solutions of a set of linear 
inequalities. Accordingly, by sweeping over 
pk  the linear-programming techniques were 
used to generate the entire parametric space of 
the stabilizing ( , , )p i dk k k  values for (4.3). 
The necessary ranges of stabilizing pk  can be 
prescribed by using the root locus method 
presented in [17, 24]. 
  To determine the admissible ( , , )p i dk k k  
values satisfying the H∞  optimization criteria 
(4.2), we first sweep over [0, 2 )θ π∈  and use 
the method presented in [17, 24] to determine 
the necessary ranges of pk  such that the 
admissible ( , )i dk k  values of conditions (1) 
and (2) may exist. Then with a fixed pk  in the 
necessary ranges, using the results from [23]-
[25], we are able to determine the entire 
admissible ( , )i dk k  region such that condition 
(1) is satisfied. The resulting admissible set is 
denoted by S1. With the same pk , sweeping 
over [0, 2 )θ π∈ , and using the results of [23]-
[25] again, we can determine  the entire 
admissible ( , )i dk k  region such that condition 
(2) is satisfied. Let S2 denote the resulting 
admissible set. Condition (3) gives a set of 
linear inequalities in ik  and the resulting 
admissible set is denoted by S3. Then for a 
fixed pk , the admissible ( , )i dk k  region 
achieving robust performance is given by 
∩ ∩
 
By sweeping over pk  in the necessary ranges 
and determining the corresponding S at each 
stage, we can obtain the entire set of the 
admissible ( , , )p i dk k k  gain values such that 
the H∞  optimization criterion (4.2) is satisfied. 
 
Remark 4.1 The PID controller structure used 
in Fig. 1 can be regarded as:

Using a linear transformation proposed in [17] 
to reparametrize the controller parameters, 
then the H∞  PID design is applicable to the 
PID controller in the form of (4.4).

6.  Application to Robust Position Control 
of a DC Servomotor System 
 
In this section, we apply the preceding 
design technique to the problem of position 
control of a DC servomotor system. The 
control objective here is to design PID 
controller to achieve good step response in the 
presence of actuator saturation and transient 
load disturbance.  We first formulate this 
control problem as robust anti-windup PID 
controller design. Then the proposed anti-
windup PID design method is used to 
determine a set of admissible controllers and 
the experimental results are represented to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed 
PID control. 
  An experimental setup has been constructed 
as shown by the schematic diagram in Fig. 3. 
The setup consists of a DSP board, a ball-screw 
driven mechanism, a DC servomotor, and 
power circuitry for driving the servomotor.  
The position control system uses a DC 
servomotor to drive a ball-screw whose angular 
position determines the location of the platform 
on which a load is added.  The controller is 
implemented on the DSP board based on the 
Texas Instruments TMS320F2812 digital signal 
processor (150 MHz/32-bit). A voltage signal is 
generated according to the design control law 
through the D/A converter and is also supplied 
to the motor driver. The operation range of the 
D/A converter is 10±  volts. An optical 
encoder with resolution 2000 pulse/rev attached 
to the shaft of the motor is used to measure the 
angular position of the motor shaft.

  Using the techniques of system identification, 
the model of the voltage input of the motor to 
the position of the platform is obtained. It is 
given by

Anti-windup PID controllers for the servomotor 
system are designed to meet the following step-
response performance specifications: 
z Settling time is approximately 5 
seconds for the system output to 
achieve 95% of its final value. 
z Overshoot is less than 15%. 
Based on weight selection given in [28], the 
performance weighting function 1( )W s  is 
chosen as the approximation of the inverse 
sensitivity function of an acceptable closed-
loop system. The resulting expression of 1( )W s  
is given by

performance specifications. 
 
7.  Experimental Results 
 
  The controller designed in the previous 
section is implemented on the DSP system as 
shown in Fig. 3. Implementation is done by 
discretizing the PID controller with the Tustin 
transformation and a sampling frequency of 1 
kHz. To assess the performance of the closed-
loop system, a 100 mm set-point reference and 
a transient load disturbance are considered. 
  For the sake of system performance 
comparison, the PID control is first 
implemented without the anti-windup 
compensator. The load disturbance is added by 
turning the shaft of the motor manually. The 
output position response and control voltage 
are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. 
From Fig. 4, it is shown that the position 
response has a large overshoot and a long 
settling time for both set-point reference and 
 9
design. The results of this paper are currently 
under preparation for a submission to the 46th 
IEEE Conference on Decision and Control.
