many innovative technologies including: wireless 
impulsive powering, multi-fold energy transfer, 
diversified energy transfer, and miniature 
implantable antennas in order to achieve power supply 
more efficiently under smaller average input power 
(<-5 dBm). Second, we further design compact high-
power portable impulsive input device to recharge the 
electronic devices wirelessly at anytime and anywhere 
(roaming type). Third, this project will evaluate the 
influences of the practical wireless channel on the 
PCE in order to design the optimal pulse shape for 
energy transfer, while the power supply modules will 
be implanted onto the biomedical devices to validate 
the integration and the performance of the system.

 the output voltage markedly increases with a reduction in the duty cycle. Evaluation of embedded rectenna in 
pork of using impulsive power is shown in [4]. However, design challenges of miniaturized, implantable 
UWB antennas persist, as well as the matching issue over extremely large broad band width. 
 
This work presents a novel scheme to overcome the above problems. Rather than using single frequency, 
continuous wave (CW) or UWB impulsive waveforms, dual tone or multi-tone CW microwave power is 
transmitted simultaneously. Also, additional output power can be gained due to non-uniform power 
distributions and non-linear exponentially-increased transfer curves of the rectifier, as discussed later. 
Meanwhile, a dual band matching design can increase the efficiency of receiving power into the rectifier. 
When more than two tones are involved, a broad frequency spread results in complicated matching network. 
Therefore, four- or eight-tone powering is set within a narrow bandwidth and their performance is evaluated 
in the experiments. Therefore, proper matching can be feasibly designed by assuming that the input 
impedances of the rectifier circuit over a stable loading current vary slightly over a narrow bandwidth of 60 
MHz [6].  
 
II. PROJECT PURPOSE  
Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has become one of the most-growing, high impact 
technologies that will revolutionize the world in the recent years. The power supply module for biomedical 
implantable devices is the core technology among them. Conventionally, batteries or wired power transfer will 
cause the limitations of implanted devices in time and in space; therefore, the wireless power technology 
applying in biomedical implantable devices will become an urgent matter and an on-going trend. The most 
critical part of the wireless power transfer technology is its power conversion efficiency (PCE). To develop an 
efficient wireless power supply system will prolong to expand the applicable scenario and the use of time of 
the implantable devices. This project for multiple-year terms proposes “the multi-fold, high efficiency, 
roaming wireless power transfer technologies” to allow the biomedical devices implanting in a limited, tiny 
area under the subcutaneous tissues to receive sufficient external wireless power supply securely and convert 
to the output voltage efficiently. We propose technologies of wireless impulsive powering, multi-fold energy 
transmission, and miniature implantable antennas in order to achieve power supply more efficiently under 
smaller average input power (<-5 dBm). Therefore, this project is not simply to improve the traditional 
characteristics of wireless power transfer technology, but rather to develop a novel wireless power transfer 
technology based on broadband pulses, to design miniature broadband antennas and broadband matching 
network, to optimize performance. Such multi-fold wireless power transmission techniques not only promote 
the efficiency of the power supply, but also can be applied in biomedical implantable devices to monitor 
physiological vital parameters in the human body for a long time. The goal of this project is to provide 
devices wireless power for required data for professional medical diagnosis, to implement the remote home 
care, to promote the health care status of our people effectively, and further to enhance the quality of life of all 
mankind.

where X denotes the random variable of the instantaneous powers in dBm and D represents the duty 
cycle for the impulse waves. Consider a rectifier consisting of a 2-stage voltage doubler  that follows a 
specific transfer function Vout(t)=Hrectifier(Pin,dB(t)) at the moment t. Hrectifier(∙) can increase monotonically and 
have a convex property due to the exponential growth of the diode current with a bias. Notably, PCE is largely 
determined by Hrectifier(∙) and can be further optimized based on the lumped element parameters in a rectifier 
[9]. Rather than optimizing the rectifier, this work proposes another angle of view by varying the power 
supply compositions to induce different output powers over the same rectifier circuit, i.e., same Hrectifier(∙). 
Therefore, the average output voltage can be estimated as the expected value of the input power based on the 
transfer function Hrectifier(∙) and the probability distribution Pcdf,UWB or Pcdf,2-tone, by assuming that the Schottky 
diodes respond quickly enough for these instantaneous powers. The improvement ratios and trends can be 
estimated empirically. 
 Vout, dc = E { Hrectifier(Pin, dBm) } (4) 
According to the observation of the impulsive test, the output voltage significantly increases with a 
decreasing cycle D. Although the instantaneous power is normally zero, a small portion of high peak power 
(Pavg/D) drives on the rectifier with a significantly higher efficiency under the exponential-like curve of 
Hrectifier(∙) than that of CW waves, i.e. D=100%. Therefore, this work devises non-uniform power distributions, 
in which a portion of large instance powers can be used to increase the output voltage. Consequently, the 
same average input power can output a high PCE based on the portion of the high-level power. Impulsive 
sources can be generated by an impulsive circuit which is relatively complex. Therefore, a straightforward 
method by simply combining two CWs spontaneously generates a non-uniform voltage distribution to 
simplify the entire circuit. Figure 2 shows the measurement of the power spectrum, the instantaneous voltage, 
and CDF of the mixed two -8 dBm CW signals at 1.83 GHz and 3.36 GHz. This figure reveals that more than 
48% of the instantaneous power exceeds the average power and 33% surpasses the total power of these two 
signals, implying the potential of the PCE improvement. Figures 2(b)(d)(e) show the waveform and 
distribution of the close signals within 50 MHz.

 The main modified monopole radiator is surrounding along the perimeter to provide an 
omni-like radiation pattern as well as high antenna efficiency. Another feature is the special fed 
structure for impedance matching. The fed part includes a 7×1.4 mm
2
 metal pad and a surrounding 
thin wire of total length of 25 mm to provide capacitive impedance adjustment.  
 
From this radiator structure, a monopole radiator with dual resonance modes through a single 
path is induced (λ/4 and λ/2 for low and high frequencies, respectively). The total current path along 
the periphery is 45 mm which is slightly longer than the estimated length for 1.83 GHz mode (41 mm) 
due to shrink area of the ground. This portion is marked as Reference Antenna in this paper. Then the 
high resonant frequency can be generated at 3.22 GHz at the same time. From Fig. 3 (b), a thin wire 
of total 25 mm length is added the feeding part (Type 1) to enhance the coupling and balance the 
reactance to form a resonance circle at 1.83 GHz (Fig. 4). To control the upper operation frequency, 
the metal pad inside the thin wire is extended (Type 2) to reduce the inductive reactance caused by 
the thin wire and eventually make the impedance at 3.35 GHz drag inside the circle of VSWR = 2. 
This dual band antenna achieves both the low band of 1796 - 1850 MHz and high band of 3243 - 
3441 MHz and the impedance bandwidths are about 55MHz and 200MHz, respectively. The 
measured gain is from -1.79 to -1.12 dBi and from 1.05 to 2 dBi, respectively. The simulation and 
implementation are matched to each other and their return loss is shown in Fig. 5.

 V. MEASUREMENT SETUP 
Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the multi-tone WPT of the same input power can increase 
the output voltage and PCE of the rectifier. The rectifier (doubler rectifier) composed of two schottky diodes 
and two capacitors, Cs = 8.2 (μF) and Cf = 1 (μF). The schottky diode is Avago HSMS-286C whose detailed 
parameters can be found in the datasheet. Some parameters for its equivalent linear circuit model include Rs = 
6.0 (Ω), CJ = 0.18 (pF), and RJ =
0.026
/(5×10
-8
 + Ib), where Ib is externally applied bias current. This dual-tone 
power transmission is first evaluated through cables to obtain transfer function Hrectifier without a propagation 
loss; realistic indoor measurements are then setup for testing. Two equal power CW tones at 1.83 and 3.36 
GHz are generated from a vector network analyzer (Agilent-E5071C) and a signal generator 
(Agilent-E8267D), which also provides the function of generating multiple tones of up to 8 tones. Two signal 
sources suggest that the coherent and synchronized setup is unnecessary. A power combiner (up to 8 GHz) 
sums up these multiple tones. Accurate powers are calibrated by Agilent-U2001A power meter on the input 
plane of the rectifier. The wireless power delivery uses the proposed dual band antennas.  
 
The wireless power source in a transmitter is amplified by a 20-dB gain PA (Mini-Circuits ZRON-8G) to 
overcome path loss at the distance of 10 cm in the far-field zone. These wired or wireless powers are delivered 
through a double frequency matching network to the rectifier. A 100 kΩ resistor, a 300 μF capacitor, or a 1 mF 
capacitor is connected as loads or storage components. Finally, the performance is evaluated by an induced 
output voltage and recharging time for a capacitor. 
 
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Wired Measurements 
Wired setup experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concept and 
related phenomenon, including single frequency (single tone), dual tone CWs, and multi-tones waves as the 
power sources to determine the induced power. Hrectifier(∙) is approximated by curve fitting of the measured 
rectifier (Hrectifier(Pin) = exp 
0.175(Pin)+1.627
). Figure 8 summarizes those results. While using single 1.83 and 3.36 
GHz CW of -5 dBm, Vout is 1.5 V and 0.79 V, respectively. However, by using dual-tone instead, the output 
voltage can increase to 1.72 V (31.5% additional power increase). According to (4) and the power distribution 
referred in Fig. 2, the predicted induced output voltage is 1.62 V which gains 19.2% additional power 
compared with the CW output voltage of 1.48 V in numerical analysis. The error of output voltages (1.62/1.72) 
is 5.8% due to the errors of the approximated transfer function and assumption of short responding time of 
Schottky diodes. However, this analytic procedure can provide an initial estimate of the PCE improvement. 
This specific model presents an example to demonstrate the improvement, and the multi-tone WPT still gains 
some benefits if other rectifiers are applied. The improvement percentage depends on several factors including 
distributions of input power, composition of multiple tones, the resistive load, average power strength, the 
rectifier, and diode parameters. Moreover, increasing the number of tones up to 8 around 1.83 GHz within the 
bandwidth can significantly improve the induced voltage by 3.8 and 2 times with respect to single tone Vout at 
3.36 GHz and 1.83 GHz, respectively. Therefore, the transfer function of power conversion is both a function 
of input power (PIN) and the components of the CWs such as multiple tones.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
This work presents a novel multiple tone wireless power transmission scheme to increase the induced 
output voltage and efficiency. Both analytical and measured results demonstrate that the PCE depends not 
only on the average input power but also on the distribution of the input power. Due to the path losses in free 
space, we recommend multiple tones at low frequencies. Dual-tone WPT can increase the output voltage by 
14%. Increasing the number of tones can increase the induced voltage by 3.8 times under adequately 
controlled environments. Finally, a 330 μF capacitor is used for wireless recharging within 10.12 sec. Efforts 
are underway to optimize the multiple-tone WPT systems.

Abstract  —  A novel rectenna is proposed for the power 
supply of implantable dental devices in biomedical monitor 
applications. Several challenges include the design of compact 
implantable antenna on teeth and the conversion efficiency of 
the rectifier at low input power for biomedical applications, so a 
high efficient dental rectenna is required. In this paper, a 
compact dental antenna is designed within 811.58 (736) cm3 
over MedRadio band (401~406 MHz), and a high efficiency 
rectifier is applied to achieve more than 70% power conversion 
efficiency (PCE). Also, applying the proposed wideband wireless 
power transmission technique can further improve the output 
voltage by nearly 90 % based on the varying the duty cycles.  
Index Terms — Rectenna, dental antenna, wireless power 
transmission (WPT), wideband WPT, power conversion

I. INTRODUCTION 
In the current era of cloud computing, health care services 
may gradually become a part of cloud services, which are 
extended from the remote home care [1] and integrated 
electronic and medical resources. Moreover, biomedical 
resources may be redistributed and used more efficiently. One 
of important device for such services is the personal or 
implantable devices to seizure biological information and 
signals. After implanting the device, the device monitors 
biological signals for detection and observation and sends out 
the messages wirelessly. Moreover, the power supply module 
is one of the core technologies and also one of the highlight 
applications can be useful for biomedical devices. 
A special implantable position is investigated on teeth due 
to the minimally invasive feature [2]. The kind of minimally 
invasive implantable device features high efficacy and incurs 
low surgical risks. The health condition of the human body 
can be determined by detecting a few physiological signals, 
such as body temperature, blood concentration, pH value, 
blood glucose, and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2). 
The saliva is also very useful for the diagnostic applications [3] 
including autoimmune diseases, endocrine disorders, and 
infectious diseases with on the developments of the related 
bio-sensors. In this paper, we propose the wireless power 
supply technologies for the minimally invasive implantable 
device to coat over dental prostheses for health monitoring.  
The wireless power technology is suitable to apply in 
biomedical implantable devices to prevent the problems of 
batteries or wired power transfer the implanted devices. One 
of the major challenges for the wireless power transfer (WPT) 
technology is its power conversion efficiency (PCE) and 
output voltage. In biomedical applications, the available input 
power must be limited for security to meet the requirement of 
maximal Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), so the traditional 
WPT technologies may not achieve their optimal efficiency 
operating conditions. In this paper, a wideband power transfer 
technologies based on varying duty cycle is proposed to 
generate sufficient wireless power supply under low average 
input power from external power supply device and to 
improve the conversion efficiency.

 II. Overview of Teeth Rectenna Systems 
The teeth rectenna system is formed of an implantable 
dental antenna and a high efficient rectifier as shown in Fig. 1. 
The biomedical device operates at the MedRadio band (401 
MHz – 406 MHz), so the size of the antenna is one of the 
major limitations to design. The common size of a patch 
antenna at MedRadio band is approximately 7×6 cm
2
, which is 
not a feasibly implantable size on teeth. The choice of size is 
based on the average molar of Asians whose size is 
approximately 8  11.5  8 mm3. Besides, we should take into 
consideration that shrinking the antenna aperture also reduces 
the bandwidth and the antenna efficiency. This is be resolved 
by a mixed type design of the antenna to expand the 
bandwidth. 
The rectifier is based on two stage voltage doubled circuit. 
However, traditional rectifier degrades its efficiency 
performance significantly. Therefore, instead of using 
conventional continuous wave for WPT, we further vary the 
duty cycles of the pulse waves and form a broadband power 
transmission system to enhance the PCE of the rectifier at its

 direction coupler and a power meter (Agilent U2000A). The 
simple mouth cavity model is based on actual volume and 
thickness of muscle tissue (by using pork). Therefore, the 
feasibility and effectiveness of the wideband WPT systems are 
verified in the biomedical implantable environments.

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
(A) Verifying the performance of the rectifier circuit 
The resistive loads for the operation condition of the 
RF-DC rectifier circuit are measured according to the process 
to determine the optimal PCE in [5]. At fixed input power (0 
dBm), output voltages and PCEs are measured under different 
load to determine the 5 kΩ as the optimal load. When the 
input power is 9 dBm, the best PCE achieves 73.2% and the 
output voltage is 5.391 volt as shown in Fig. 5. 
 
Fig. 5 The performance of the second order RF-DC rectifier circuit. 
 
Fig. 6 The PCE vs. input power of the rectifier with different duty cycles. 
(B) Verifying the performance of wideband WPT 
systems 
After adjustments of the impulsive duty cycle at 100% 
(referred as traditional continuous wave), 50%, 25%, 10%, the 
optimal loads are determined to be 5 kΩ, 8 kΩ, 15 kΩ, and 30 
kΩ, respectively by the procedure as mentioned previously. 
The results are shown in Fig. 6. As duty cycle reduces, the 
input powers for maximal PCE decrease, implying that the 
best PCE can be achieved at a relatively small input power.  
When the input power is smaller than 0 dBm, the PCE can be 
effectively enhanced as the duty cycle reduces. For instance, 
at the input power of -15 dBm, PCE can be improved from the 
20.9% to 29.1% as the duty cycle reduces from 100% to 25 %. 
(C) Verifying the performance in the wireless 
biomedical implantable environments 
The teeth antenna is implanted in the mimic mouth model 
as shown in Fig. 4 to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of 
wideband WPT system in biomedical environment, and the 
loads are chosen according to the previous setup. Figure 7 
shows the relationship of the output voltage and the input 
power of the rectifier received by the teeth antenna. At the 
same received power, the output voltage can increase 
effectively through the duty cycle adjustments. At the input 
power of -5 dBm, the output voltage increases by 89% (from 
0.9 V to 1.7 V) as the duty cycle decreases to 10%.

duty cycles in wireless biomedical environments. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
A novel teeth antenna and a high efficiency rectifier form 
the rectenna for the compact power supply of implantable 
dental devices. The compact dental antenna operates at 
MedRadio band (401~406 MHz) and its area is 245 cm
2
. 
Moreover, the proposed wideband wireless power 
transmission technique is verified in the biomedical 
implantable environments through the wireless experiments, 
and the output voltage can improve significantly at low input 
power by varying the duty cycles.
