the microstructure changes and establish the system 
further to evaluate the ability of thin film adhesion 
on the substrate. In the experimental study, the 
externally-applied electrical current can be provided 
to investigate the contact electrical resistance 
arising at the thin-film specimens, and then obtain 
the rate of electrical resistance. The experimental 
results obtained from in-situ TEM measurements can be 
provided as the auxiliary information in the analyses 
of above thin film parameters (or behavior). The 
timely monitor technique can be thus developed. 
The theoretical model and the technique for the 
measurement of thin-film contact electrical 
resistance become the main goals of thin study. The 
improvements in the inspection technique and the 
precision in measurements are also included. The ECR 
nano tester is employed to establish the technique 
able to track and distinguish the fatigue failure and 
even the phase change in the thin film microstructure 
during the nanoindentation process. The delamination 
behavior occurring in the thin films due to dynamic 
loading conditions is also investigated.

2. Theoretical Model for Internal Stresses and Contact Depths Arising in the Unloading 
Process of Nanoindentation Test 
Figure 1(a) shows the force and moment diagram of a simply-supported rectangular beam 
subject to a uniform pressure p in the central region with a length of 2c. It should be stressed that 
half crevice width, 'a , is a variable expressed as a function of the indentation depth in the 
unloading process. R and M are defined as the equivalent force and moment, respectively, 
created at one end of the simply-supported beam. The force and moment balances are given as: 
cpRR BA 2−=+                                                                                                                        (1)

The one-dimensional elastic deflection y(x) of the composite film and the internal moment (M) 
in Fig. 1(b) can be obtained as:

where *fE  is the reduced Young’s modulus of the composite film. The central deflection maxw  is 
actually equal to the contact depth hc. Substituting the p parameter, the central deflection, and

According to the membrane theory, the solution for the central deflection maxw can be 
obtained to have the same form as Eq. (6). In the loading process, half of the crevice length is 
found to be quite close to the radius of the circle inside tangential to ∆ABC. In the unloading 
process, the crevice length shown in Fig. 1(b), a′2 , is increased to be larger than max2a . At the 
end of the unloading process, the crevice length is increased to a maximum value of max2a′ . By 
the Hooke law, IfI E εσ *=  can be rewritten as

In the unloading process, Eq. (8) can be applied directly to determine the (hc)buckling value if 
the indentation load ( )cF , half of the crevice length 'a , and the internal stress Iσ corresponding 
to the buckling behavior arising in the final unloading process are available. Therefore, Eq. (8) 
for the unloading process can be rewritten as

Here,  Iσ  can be determined equal to ( )( )Rbuckling σσ − , where Rσ denotes the residual stress, 
which is a constant value obtained from the experiments based on the specimen’s topography. 
Equation (11) is applied to determine the ( )dhdFc /  curve as a function of  ( )RI σσ + . This curve 
is valid for various k values. The ( )( )RbucklingI σσ +  value can be determined if the ( )bucklingc dhdF /  
value is known from the indentation experiment. The ( )bucklingIσ  value in Eq. (18) is thus 
determined. From the study of Marshall and Evans [11], the internal stress Iσ of the indented

The results for the indentation depth as a function of time are shown in the mid-left corner of    
Fig. 2, and then, the load-depth profile for the entire indentation process is obtained. Figure 3 
shows the load (Fc)-depth (h) profiles for the entire indentation process. The load in the loading 
process operates with a periodic partial unloading/reloading.  At the end of the loading process, a 
dwelling process with the maximum load (1000 µN) occurs, and then, the unloading process is 
carried out at an unloading rate of 100 µN/s. Figure 7 shows the electrical current variations in 
the entire indentation process of the Al (200nm)/SS specimen in response to the force-depth 
conditions that were shown in Fig. 3. In the loading process, the electrical currents coded 1 to 8 
are seemed to protrude out of the electrical current curve in respond the partial 
unloading/reloading behavior. However, a sharp rise in electrical current appears at the 
indentation depth between codes 3 and 4, but it is almost closer to code 4. After code 4, there is a 
noticeable indentation depth increase but almost constant with electrical current lying between 
codes 4 and 5. The end of this sharp rise and the start of the stabilization of the electrical current 
are speculated to be features of a buckling point with an unknown mode. The validity of this 
conjecture and the buckling mode are discussed in a later section. A significant rise in electrical 
current occurs just before the start of buckling, which occurs at a depth (h) about 240 nm. In 
general, the thin film delaminates from the substrate material before reaching the buckling point. 
The thin film is suspended at its two ends when subjected to an indentation load, and the 
deflection of this suspended film increases slightly with the indentation depth. This causes the 
contact area between the indenter and the composite film increases, and this also elevates the 
electrical current. If the buckling point is not reached yet, the increase in the contact electrical 
current is quite limited, as shown in Fig. 4. However, continuous increases in the indentation 
depth finally allow the buckling behavior to take place. The sudden drop of the indenter due to 
buckling causes a sudden increase in the contact area between the lateral surface of the indenter 
and the specimen, and this leads to a sharp increase in the electrical current between codes 3 and 
5 too. After the buckling point, the electrical current continues to rise along with the indentation 
depth. Equation (17) is developed to be a general form for various buckling modes. In the present 
study, n = 1 for the first-mode buckle and n = 2 for the second-mode buckle were used to 
calculate their respective hc values. The applied load corresponding to the buckling point in the 
loading process is about 3109.2 −× N. The Al (Poisson's ratio 33.0=υ ) film thickness is 
710.2 −× m. For the Berkovich indenter 03.70=α , and the residual stress Rσ  is evaluated to be 
91072.3 × N/m2. The *fE value is calculated as 91055.78 × N/m2, while the hc value for n = 1 is 
obtained to have 83 nm, and for n = 2 is 219 nm. The hc value for n = 2 is obviously very close to 
the indentation depth of the starting point of buckling (h ≅  240 nm), and its value is slightly 
smaller than this indentation depth. The contact depth hc developed by Oliver and Pharr is 
applied to determine the approximate indentation depth h corresponding to this hc value with the 
following expression

here, the geometric constant χ in Eq. (23) for the Berkovich indenter is 0.75 if the indenter is 
treated as an equivalent cone, (dP/dh)buckle, which means the unloading stiffness occurring at this 
second-mode buckling point is estimated to have a value of 78 µN/nm. This value is roughly 
estimated from the (dP/dh) values evaluated at the code 4 and 5 points. (h)buckle is thus calculated
