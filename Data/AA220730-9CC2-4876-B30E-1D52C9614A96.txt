一、前言 
    現代化的大眾捷運系統是交通主要的運輸模式，在全球大都會區每年約有數十億乘客在
使用。捷運系統有別於其他交通工具，其主要是建構在地下隧道或高架軌道上的獨立運輸系
統。然而，地下部分的捷運系統是一個密閉空間，無論污染物是源自外部大氣環境或自內部
產生，皆可能促使污染物濃度上升。如果機械通風系統不能適當地運作，污染物濃度可能會
累積至具有危害的程度 (Nieuwenhuijsen 等，2007)。在捷運系統地面環境的空氣品質可能比
在地下環境更容易受到室外交通的直接影響(Kam 等，2011)，從道路車輛所排放的污染物很
容易被傳輸到捷運車站內。例如，巴士經常被作為乘客的轉乘工具，且在捷運車站附近皆設
有巴士停靠站。在這些巴士停靠站通常存在著較高濃度的粒狀污染物，而這些高濃度的粒狀
污染物往往源自於巴士在減速、怠速、或加速時燃料燃燒不完全所排放(Yip 等， 2006; Kinsey
等，2007; Richmond-Bryant 等，2009; Jayaratne 等，2009; Wang 等，2010)。不管探討地面或
地下部分的捷運系統，捷運站內的空氣品質已是一個重要的議題。因為乘客每一天均花費可
觀的時間搭乘捷運系統。根據先前的研究，高濃度的粒狀污染物已在許多的地鐵系統中被測
得 (Fromme 等，1998; Pfeifer 等，1999; Sitzmann 等，1999; Adams 等，2001; Johansson 和 
Johansson，2003; Seaton 等，2005; Braniš，2006; Ripanucci 等，2006; Li 等，2007; Kim 等，
2008; Park 和 Ha，2008; Raut 等，2009)。 
二、研究目的 
    截至本研究進行時，台北捷運系統已完成 8 條路線，營運總長度延伸至 90.5 公里（50 %
地下），連接 82 個車站（63% 地下）。目前，每天有超過 140 萬的乘客搭乘台北捷運系統。
乘客在尖峰時段和非尖峰時段通常分別花費約 2-4 分鐘和 3-6 分鐘在月台上等候列車。晚上
11 時後，乘客等待列車的時間增加到 10-15 分鐘。儘管如此，乘客每天經常花費大量的時間
在捷運系統內，在某些情況下更達 1- 2 小時。有關乘客在台北捷運系統中暴露於懸浮微粒的
議題必須受到關注。因為懸浮微粒已被確認對環境有很嚴重的衝擊，它對健康的影響已成為
一個最重要的問題 (Pope 等，2004)。此外，學者 Karlsson 等(2005)指出地鐵的粒狀污染物比
街道上的粒狀污染物更具基因毒性，對人體肺部細胞更具氧化能力。然而，在台北捷運系統
中有關地面車站和地下車站粒狀污染物的特性和差異性的相關資料是極為有限的。因此，本
研究在同一條捷運路線上的三個不同類型車站使用攜帶式監測器測量車站戶外、售票大廳及
月台的 PM10 和 PM2.5 濃度、微粒質量粒徑分布及超細微粒數目濃度。此外，其他的室內空
氣品質參數，如：一氧化碳濃度與二氧化碳濃度也一併測量。現場測量的結果將用來探討車
站戶外和室內環境 PM10、PM2.5、超細微粒、一氧化碳和二氧化碳濃度之間的關係，並比較在
台北捷運系統中地面車站和地下車站內環境的 PM10、PM2.5、超細微粒、一氧化碳和二氧化碳
濃度的差異性。微粒質量粒徑分布的分析可用來探討捷運車站內及週遭環境中懸浮微粒的特
徵。 
三、文獻探討 
 Nieuwenhuijsen 等 (2007) 和 Salma 等(2007) 的研究中指出，在不同的地鐵系統中粒狀
污染物濃度的差異可能源自於所使用的系統和設備的不同，如電力系統、制動系統、通風系
統和操作條件等。因此，經過多年的使用後粒狀污染物可能會累積在通風系統內或自設備本
身產生，因而在較老的地鐵系統中可量測到高濃度的粒狀污染物 (Cheng 等， 2008)。另外，
Kim 等 (2008)也指出，在不同的地鐵系統中粒狀污染物濃度的差異可能是由於不同的監測
條件所導致，如測量的時間、地點或季節、測量的設備和戶外氣候。此外，Johansson 和 
 3
下月台的PM10濃度分別顯著高於戶外的PM10濃度約1.2和1.4倍（戶外與售票大廳的p=0.016、
戶外與月台的p<0.001）。台北主站與民權西路站地下月台的PM2.5濃度也顯著高於戶外的PM2.5
濃度約1.3倍（台北主站的p =0.014，民權西路站的p =0.006）。然而，民權西路站地下月台的
PM10濃度和台北主站地下售票大廳的PM2.5濃度與戶外的測量值並無顯著性差異(民權西路站
月台與戶外的p= 0.188，台北主站售票大廳與戶外的p=0.107)。測量結果顯示在地下環境中的
懸浮微粒濃度大多高於在戶外環境中的懸浮微粒濃度，說明在地下系統的內部可能會產生額
外的懸浮微粒，因而導致較高的懸浮微粒濃度。此外，在台北主站地下售票大廳和月台均可
觀察到高濃度的粗微粒，特別是在售票大廳。測量結果顯示在地下售票大廳的粗微粒可能是
由於在此密閉空間中每天高達290,000人次的大量旅客在移動過程中所造成的揚塵。此外，在
地下月台的粗微粒濃度亦可能藉由車輪與軌道的機械摩擦及制動器磨損而提升。 
    在地面室內環境中的測量結果顯示地面上室內環境與戶外環境的PM10和PM2.5濃度都有
強烈的正相關性（所有的RPearson≧0.894和所有的p<0.001），這表示在地面室內環境的懸浮微
粒可能源自戶外環境。另外，劍潭站高架月台與戶外環境的PM10和PM2.5濃度也均無顯著性差
異 (PM10的p=0.362與PM2.5的p=0.470) ，但存在著強烈的正相關性 (PM10的RPearson= 0.923和p< 
0.001與PM2.5的RPearson = 0.901和p < 0.001）。測量結果亦證實在劍潭站高架月台上的懸浮微粒
濃度比地下月台的懸浮微粒濃度更易受到戶外環境懸浮微粒濃度的影響。根據實驗結果顯
示，在地下環境中的PM10和PM2.5濃度均大於地面室內環境的PM10和PM2.5濃度。這些結果表
示，地下環境懸浮微粒的來源與地面室內環境懸浮微粒的來源有顯著地差異。 
3.2比較在三個不同類型捷運車站的微粒粒徑分布 
    以前相關於地下或地面車站內微粒質量粒徑分布的研究較缺少。圖2a-c顯示在三個捷運
站所測得的平均微粒質量粒徑分布。在每個測量地點可觀察到微粒質量粒徑分布均呈現雙峰
的分布。根據測量結果，在三個捷運站戶外的微粒質量粒徑分布並沒有差別。與戶外路邊相
比較，在台北主站的地下售票大廳和月台存在著較高的粗微粒(>10 µm)。此外，戶外路邊、
台北主站售票大廳及月台之間的細微粒亦不相同。這些結果顯示在台北主站地下售票大廳和
月台上較大的粗微粒可能源自於大量乘客的移動所造成的揚塵，而細微粒則可能源於站外透
過自動電扶梯隧道而進入。此外，台北主站地下月台的粗微粒也可能因機械摩擦而產生。有
關細微粒的部分在民權西路站地下月台也觀察到相同的結果。但是，在民權西路站地下月台
並未觀察到高濃度的粗微粒。在民權西路站地下月台存在著較低的粗微粒的可能原因是這些
粗微粒被通風系統所過濾(Chan等，2002)，但在台北主站地下售票大廳與月台的通風系統並
未能有效地將粗微粒過濾。此外，在劍潭站高架月台上的微粒質量粒徑分布不同於那些在台
北主站及民權西路站地下月台的微粒質量粒徑分布，卻相似於戶外環境的微粒質量粒徑分
布。再次驗證在高架月台開放空間環境的懸浮微粒強烈地受到戶外環境的影響。在地面室內
環境中，民權西路站和劍潭站售票大廳的粗微粒亦略高於那些在戶外環境的粗微粒，這表示
在地面售票大廳的粗微粒也是由於乘客的移動所造成的揚塵，但由於地面售票大廳自然通風
較好且在民權西路站和劍潭站的乘客人次約僅有台北主站的四分之一到五分之一，因此在民
權西路站和劍潭站的揚塵並沒有像台北主站地下售票大廳那麼嚴重。盡管如此，在劍潭站與
民權西路站售票大廳的細微粒部分則類似於戶外環境。很顯然地，室外交通的排放可能是地
面車站懸浮微粒主要的來源。

Cheng, Y. H.* and Yan, J. W., 2011, Atmospheric Environment, 45, 4882-4891.  
stations is an important issue for commuters, due to the considerable
amount of time they spend traveling in the MRT system each day.
Based on previous studies, high concentrations of PM have been
measured inmanymetro systems (Fromme et al.,1998; Pfeifer et al.,
1999; Sitzmann et al., 1999; Adams et al., 2001; Johansson and
Johansson, 2003; Seaton et al., 2005; Branis, 2006; Ripanucci
et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Park and Ha, 2008;
Raut et al., 2009). Nevertheless, low PM levels have been reported
in some modern metro systems (Chan et al., 2002; Gómez-Perales
et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2008). Nieuwenhuijsen et al. (2007) and
Salma et al. (2007) pointed out that differences in PM levels among
different metro systems may be due to different systems and
equipment such as the power system, braking system, ventilation
system, and operational conditions. Accordingly, PM can accumu-
late in ventilation systems or be generated by equipment over
a period of years, thereby introducing high levels of PM in oldmetro
systems (Cheng et al., 2008). Additionally, Kim et al. (2008) noted
that differences in PM levels among differentmetro systemsmay be
due to different monitoring conditions such as the time, place, or
season of the measurements, the equipment involved, and the
outdoor climate. Moreover, Johansson and Johansson (2003) and
Salma et al. (2007) reported that PM levels in underground metro
stations are closely associated with the frequency at which trains
run. Their results indicate that PM levels can be induced through re-
suspension due to the movement of trains. Additionally, coarse PM
may also be generated through mechanical disintegration within
metro systems. Themetallic elementsmost commonly encountered
in PM in metro systems included Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Cu (Chillrud
et al., 2004; Aarnio et al., 2005; Ripanucci et al., 2006; Salma
et al., 2007, 2009), indicating that PM can be generated through
the friction of wheels and rails, brake wear, and the vaporization of
metals due to sparking (Sitzmann et al., 1999; Pfeifer et al., 1999). In
addition, Branis (2006) suggested that outdoor levels of PM signif-
icantly inﬂuence air quality in underground transport systems
through ventilation systems, escalator tunnels, and corridors. Cheng
et al. (2008) and Cheng and Lin (2010) also demonstrated that PM
levels inside metro stations and outdoors are positively correlated,
suggesting that PM levels in metro systems are inﬂuenced consid-
erably by outdoor ambient PM levels. PM may originate outside, in
ambient air, entering the stations via train tunnels and accumu-
lating in the underground system. According to these studies, PM
levels and their sources inside metro systems vary widely
throughout theworld. Therefore, it is necessary to further reveal the
contribution from outdoor sources to PM levels in the metro
systems.
At the time of the current study, the Taipei MRTcomprised 8 rapid
transit lines stretching 90.5 km (50 % underground), linking 82
stations (63% underground). Currently, over 1.4 million commuters
travel on the Taipei MRT system each day. The commuters usually
spend approximately 2e4min and 3e6min on the station platform
to wait the metro trains at the rush hour and non-rush hour,
respectively. At night after 11 pm, the waiting time for commuters
rose up to 10e15 min. However, commuters usually spend a consid-
erable amount of time, in some cases up to 1e2 h a day, in the Taipei
MRT system. The issues related to commuter exposure to PM in the
Taipei MRT system must be addressed. Because suspended PM is
recognized to have a strong impact on the environment, it has
become a major concern with regard to effects on health (Pope et al.,
2004). Furthermore, Karlsson et al. (2005) noted that metro PM was
more genotoxic than street PM, inducing oxidative stress in cultured
human lung cells.
However, information related to the characteristics and differ-
ences of PM levels at the ground-level and in the underground
stations in the Taipei MRT system is limited. Therefore, this study
measures the PM10 and PM2.5 levels, particle mass size distributions,
and particle number (PN) concentrations outside theMRT station, at
the ticket hall, and on the platform of the three different types of
MRT stations on the same rapid transit line using portable monitors.
In addition, the other indoor air quality parameters, CO and CO2
levels, temperatures, and relative humidity, were also measured in
this study. The ﬁeld measurement results were used to evaluate the
relationships of PM10, PM2.5, PN, CO, and CO2 levels between the
outdoor and indoor environments at metro stations, and compare
the PM10, PM2.5, PN, CO, and CO2 levels at the ground-level and in
the underground environments in the Taipei MRT stations. Analysis
of mass size distribution was used to characterize airborne PM in
and around the MRT stations.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Sampling location
Fig. 1 presents a map of the Taipei metropolitan area and the
Taipei MRT system. Three MRT stations, Taipei main station (UG),
Minquan W. Rd. station (AG1) and Jiantan station (AG2), are on the
same rapid transit line, and these were selected as subjects for this
study (Table 1). This line was the ﬁrst high-capacity rapid transit
line (red line) in the Taipei MRT system, beginning operation on
March 28,1997. On this line, trains travel underground between the
UG and the AG1 (approximately 1.73 km), and travel above ground
(elevated) between the AG1 and the AG2 (approximately 2.54 km).
The UG is a major transfer station in the Taipei MRT system,
located at a trafﬁc hub in the center of the Taipei metropolitan area.
This station serves commuters transferring to another rapid transit
line (blue line), shuttle buses, intercity buses, the Taiwan railway
system and Taiwan’s high-speed railway. Thus, UG is the busiest of
the three stations in this study.Moreover, the UG is an underground

(Raut et al., 2009), and similar to those measured in Hong Kong
(Chan et al., 2002), Helsinki (Aarnio et al., 2005) and Los Angeles
(Kam et al., 2011). Nieuwenhuijsen et al. (2007) and Salma et al.
(2007) pointed out that differences in PM levels among different
metro systems may be due to different system and equipment such
as the power system, braking system, ventilation system and
operational conditions. Aarnio et al. (2005) noted that lower PM
levels in the Helsinki metro system were because it is a relatively
newmetro system and has a new electric braking system that dose
not generate a great amount of PM. Same results had also been
reported by Kam et al. (2011) in the Los Angeles Metro, suggesting
its ventilation system and braking technology are probably more
efﬁcient and more advanced than older metro systems. Accord-
ingly, the Taipei MRT system has only been in operation since 1996
and has electrical regenerative braking systems making it relatively
newandmore advanced comparedwith other oldermetro systems.
For these reasons, PM levels in the Taipei MRT system were rela-
tively lower than those measured in older metro systems.
3.2. Comparison of mass size distributions and PM2.5-to-PM10 ratios
at three different types of MRT stations
Fig. 3aec shows the average particle mass size distributions
measured at the three MRT stations. Here, the measured particle
mass size distribution was determined using DistFit software.
Table 2 lists the mass median diameters and geometric standard
deviations of the mass size distributions at all selected monitoring
locations. Two modes of particle mass size distribution could be
observed at each of the selected monitoring locations. According to
measurement results, the mass size distributions outside the three
MRT stations did not differ. The mass size distributions in outdoor
environments were similar to that measured by Morawska et al.
(1999). Morawska et al. (1999) demonstrated particle size distri-
bution with a bimodal distribution pattern, showing a dominant
mode at approximately 0.3 mm and a minor mode at approximately
3.5 mm near the source of trafﬁc. Fine and coarse PM could be
attributed primarily to trafﬁc emissions and the re-suspension of
road dust by trafﬁc, respectively.
Few previous data have been reported for particle mass
size distribution in the underground or ground-level stations.
Measurement results indicate a higher fraction of large coarse PM
(>10 mm) in underground ticket hall and platform of the UG
compared to outdoor roadside. In addition, the ﬁne PM fractions
among outdoor roadside, ticket hall and platform of the UG were
also quite different. These results indicate that large fraction of
coarse PM in the underground ticket hall and platform of the UG
had been re-suspended by the movement of large numbers of
commuters, and ﬁne PM was likely transferred from its source
outside the station through escalator tunnels. In addition, the
coarse PM on the underground platform of the UG also could be
generated through the mechanical friction processes. The same
results were observed for the fraction of ﬁne PM on the under-
ground platform of the AG1. However, a large fraction of coarse PM
on the underground platform of the AG1 was not observed. The far
lower fraction of coarse PM on the underground platform of the
AG1 may be attributed to the fact that coarse PM had been ﬁltered
out by the ventilation system (Chan et al., 2002), but it appears
that the ventilation system had not been performing particularly

environments were 9.5103e1.7104 particles cm3, and signif-
icantly lower than those in outdoor environments by approxi-
mately 0.3e0.5 times (all p< 0.001). The mean PN levels in ground-
level indoor environments were 3.3104e3.8 104 particles cm3.
The PN levels in the ground-level ticket hall of the AG1 were
slightly lower than those outside, by approximately 0.9 times
(p¼ 0.018). However, the PN levels in the ground-level ticket hall of
the AG2 did not differ signiﬁcantly from those outside (p¼ 0.761).
Accordingly, the mean PN level on the elevated platform of the AG2
was 2.3104 particles cm3, and was also signiﬁcantly lower than
those at outdoor roadside approximately 0.6 times (p< 0.001). The
low PN levels on the elevated platform make it reasonable that
particles had been diluted via the ambient air in the open space of
the AG2. Despite the PN levels in the ground-level ticket hall of the
AG2, the PN levels in all indoor environments (ground-level and
underground) were signiﬁcantly lower than those in outdoor
environments (all p 0.018). These measurement results indicate
that PN levels in ground-level indoor environments had been
inﬂuenced more directly by outdoor air than those in underground
environments.
Little work has been done to measure the levels of PN in metro
systems. Levy et al. (2002) measured the mean level of PN on
the platform of the underground station in the Boston subway,
resulting in approximately 3.2104 particles cm3. Aarnio et al.
(2005) noted that the average daytime PN level on the platform
of the underground station in the Helsinki subway system was
3.1104 particles cm3. Seaton et al. (2005) measured the average
PN levels on platforms of three stations in the London underground
at 1.4104e2.9104 particles cm3, noting that PN levels on the
platforms were approximately 0.4e0.7 times lower than those in
outdoor environments. Cheng et al. (2009) noted that PN levels on
station platforms were about 1.6104 particles cm3 in the Taipei
MRT system. Based on these measurement results, the levels of PN
in underground systems are usually lower than for outdoor air.
Their origin is related to the introduction of outdoor air that
contains pollutants from trafﬁc outside the metro stations (Aarnio
et al., 2005; Seaton et al., 2005).

ABSTRACT 
 
The Taipei Bus terminal is a main transportation hub for over 50 bus routes to eastern, central, 
and southern Taiwan. Daily traffic volume at this terminal is about 2,500 vehicles, serving over 
45,000 passengers daily. This station is a massive 24-story building housing a bus terminal, a 
business hotel, a shopping mall, several cinemas, offices, private residential suites, and over 900 
parking spaces. However, air quality inside this bus terminal is a concern as over 2,500 buses are 
scheduled to run daily. The adverse health effects of fine particulate matter have been identified 
by recent epidemiological studies. Short- and long-term exposure to PM is associated with 
various health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. This study investigates 
the PM10, PM2.5 and ultrafine particulate (UFP) levels inside and outside the bus terminal. 
Measurement results show that coarse PM inside the bus terminal was re-suspended by the 
movement of large numbers of passengers. The fine and ultrafine PM in the station concourse 
were from outside vehicles. Moreover, fine and ultrafine PM at wait rooms were exhausted 
directly from buses in the building. Based on measurement results, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels in 
the bus terminal were lower than Taiwan’s EPA standards for indoor air quality proposed in 
December 2005, in which the 24-h average PM10 and 24-h average PM2.5 are 150 μg m-3 and 100 
μg m-3, respectively, for public buildings. However, UFP levels at the bus terminal were 
significantly higher than those in the urban background by about 10 times. Therefore, the effects 
of UFPs on the health of passengers and workers must be addressed at this bus terminal.  
 
Introduction 
 
Motor vehicles have been recognized as a dominant source of ambient PM in urban areas.1,2 Bus 
stations often display high concentrations of PM released as a result of the incomplete 
combustion of fuel when buses decelerate, idle and accelerate.3-7 See et al.8 showed that average

Experimental Methods 
 
Sampling Location 
 
The Taipei Bus Station is a main transportation hub for over 50 bus routes to eastern, central, and 
southern Taiwan, with a daily volume of approximately 2,500 scheduled buses, serving over 
45,000 passengers daily. The concourse on the ground floor of this bus terminal has ticket 
counters and a bus information center as well as several gift and souvenir shops. The central 
areas of the second, third, and fourth floors are passenger waiting rooms. Buses drive around the 
waiting rooms within a bus lane inside the building. Each floor has 16 platforms surrounding the 
waiting room. Passengers pass through the gates between the waiting room and the platform to 
board or alight from the buses. Buses enter the building and drive to the second floor lane, and 
exit the station from the third floor taking a route to the ground floor or exiting directly onto an 
elevated expressway from the third floor via a connecting overpass. 
 
The monitoring sites in this study were on the station concourse ground floor (S1F), waiting 
rooms on the second floor (S2F), third floor (S3F) and fourth floor (S4F), and at an outdoor 
roadside (OR) site about 10 m from the terminal entrance (Fig. 1). Excluding the OR, the indoor 
environments at the station concourse, S1F, and waiting rooms, S2F–S4F, were air-conditioned 
via a central ventilation system.  
 
Sampling Equipment and Data Collection 
 
In this study, a Grimm Series 1.108 OPC (Grimm Tech., Inc., Douglasville, GA, USA) was used 
to determine the short-term levels of the PM10, PM2.5 inside and outside the bus terminal. At the 
same time, a TSI Model 3007 CPC (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) was used to measure UFP 
levels. The Grimm OPC measures particle mass concentrations according to an optical size of 
0.23–20 μm in 15 different size ranges. The PM10 and PM2.5 levels were calculated as fractions 
of the mass size distribution.11 The measured mass size distribution was also fitted using DistFit 
software (Chimera Tech., Inc., Forest Lake, MN, USA) to determine the mass median diameter 
and geometric standard deviation. 
 
The PM10, PM2.5 and UFP levels inside and outside the bus terminal were measured 
simultaneously by a subject carrying monitors in a backpack. All air samples were collected at 
roughly 1.0–1.5 m above the floor (when subject was seating or standing). The logging interval 
for all measurements was set at 1 min. During phase I monitoring, measurements were taken 
 3
was compared with an equivalent method using the target aerosol under the same environmental 
conditions as those used to evaluate PM levels. The PM2.5 concentrations were measured 
simultaneously over a three-day period using a Grimm OPC and a Met One E-BAM sampler 
(Met One, Inc., Grants Pass, OR, USA) on the concourse of the bus terminal. The Met One 
E-BAM sampler is an automatic air monitor based on beta attenuation. The beta attenuation 
approach has been certified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Taiwan as an 
effective method. Raw data obtained by the Grimm OPC was corrected using a scaling factor to 
evaluate PM levels and mass size distributions at the bus terminal. 
 
An independent sample t-test was performed to test differences in PM levels among the selected 
locations. Moreover, an independent sample t-test was also performed to test differences in PM 
levels between monitoring periods. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. 
The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (RPearson) was also applied to determine the 
strength of correlations for PM levels among selected locations or relationships between different 
pollutants. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
PM10 and PM2.5 Levels at the Bus Terminal 
 
Figures 2a-d present PM10, PM2.5, coarse PM (PM2.5–10 or PMcoarse) levels and PM2.5-to-PM10 
ratios at the five monitoring sites. Analytical results demonstrate that PM10 levels at S1F were 
significantly higher than those at S2F, S3F, and S4F by about 1.2–1.4 times (p=0.002 for S1F vs. 
S2F, p<0.001 for S1F vs. S3F and S1F vs. S4F); however, PM2.5 levels at S1F, S2F, S3F, and S4F 
did not differ significantly (all p>0.05), indicating that coarse PM levels at S1F were 
significantly higher than those at S2F, S3F, and S4F (all p<0.001). These measurement results 
suggest that the coarse PM on the station concourse was re-suspended more than that at waiting 
rooms as passenger activity on the station concourse was greater than that at waiting rooms. The 
PM2.5-to-PM10 ratio at S1F was about 0.49, significantly lower than those at S2F, S3F, and S4F 
(all p<0.001). Moreover, the PM2.5-to-PM10 ratios at S2F, S3F, and S4F were similar. 
Measurement results suggest that PM levels on the station concourse were governed by coarse 
PM; however, those at waiting rooms were dominated by fine PM. These comparison results 
indicate that sources of PM on the station concourse differed markedly from those at waiting 
rooms. Additionally, previous studies noted that PM10 and PM2.5 levels inside highway buses 
were about 40–60 μg m-3 and 25–48 μg m-3, respectively, in Taiwan.12,13 The PM10 and PM2.5 
levels inside the bus terminal were roughly 1.5 and 1.4 times higher than those measured inside 
 5
show a strongly positive relationship for PM levels between S1F and OR (RPearson= 0.80; p<0.001 
for PM10 and RPearson= 0.88; p<0.001 for PM2.5), suggesting that variations in PM levels at S1F 
were more strongly correlated with outdoor environmental conditions than those at S2F, S3F, and 
S4F. 
 
Mass Size Distributions at the Bus Terminal

size distributions at S1F, S2F, S3F, and S4F differed from that at OR. Measurement results reveal 
that three modes existed in the lognormal size distributions at S1F, S2F, S3F, and S4F. A 
comparison of the mass size distribution between S1F and OR indicates that a high fraction of 
coarse PM (>10 μm) existed in the mass size distribution at S1F; however, the mass size 
distribution of fine PM at S1F was similar to that at OR. These measurement results indicate that 
coarse PM was re-suspended in the station concourse by movement of large numbers of 
passengers, and fine PM was likely transferred from traffic outside the terminal. The size 
distribution at OR is similar to those in typical urban traffic environments.14-16

Temporal Variations of PM10, PM2.5, and UFP Levels in the Waiting Room and on the 
Platform 
 
Figure 5 presents fluctuation in average PM10, PM2.5, and UFP levels taken at 10-min intervals 
inside the waiting room and on the platform throughout the phase II monitoring period. The 
hourly number of buses in the bus terminal is also shown in Figure 5. Measurement results show 
that PM levels varied markedly and irregularly during the sampling period, particularly on the 
platform. The PM levels on the platform rose quickly after 5:00 and dropped after 22:00. 
Fluctuations in the volume of traffic were more regular than PM levels. Hourly traffic volume at 
the bus terminal was 15–170 vehicles h -1 (mean= 107 vehicles h -1), with traffic volumes peaking 
slightly between 12:00 and 20:00. The lowest traffic volume occurred in the early hours. Based 
on measurement results, the fluctuations in the PM levels on the platform were not only caused 
by the particulate matter emitted from buses, but are also from both natural and mechanical 
ventilation conditions. However, observations have shown a positive relationship between hourly 
PM levels and hourly traffic volumes on the platform (RPearson= 0.55, p<0.001 for PM10; RPearson= 
 9
coarse PM. Moreover, the UFP levels on the platform decreased more quickly than those inside 
the waiting room in the early hours. Low UFP levels on the platform in the early hours can be 
attributed to the dispersion of contaminated air by means of natural ventilation and a reduction in 
the emissions from diesel buses. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Measurement results show that coarse PM inside the bus terminal was re-suspended by the 
movement of passengers. Additionally, sources of fine and ultrafine PM in the station concourse 
on the ground floor and at waiting rooms on the second, third, and fourth floors likely differed. 
The fine and ultrafine PM in the station concourse were from outside traffic. Moreover, fine and 
ultrafine PM at waiting rooms were likely exhausted directly from buses inside the building. 
Based on measurement results, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels in the bus terminal were lower than 
Taiwan’s EPA standards for indoor air quality proposed in December 2005, in which the 24-h 
average PM10 and PM2.5 are 150 μg m-3 and 100 μg m-3 for public buildings. However, the UFP 
levels at the bus terminal were significantly higher than those in the urban background about 10 
times. Bräuner et al.28 and Møller et al.29 noted that UFPs from traffic exhausts could induce 
DNA damage via systemic oxidative stress. Therefore, the effects of UFPs on the health of 
passengers and workers must be addressed at this bus terminal since the levels of UFPs are 
higher than >1.0×105 particles cm-3. Effective control methods for UFPs are needed to protect the 
health of passengers and workers at the bus terminal.
