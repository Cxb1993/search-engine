locating the cells with fluorescence pattern in an 
IIF image. This proposal proposes a color selector to 
transform a color IIF image into a gray-level image, 
a run length enhancer to suppress the hazy 
fluorescent halo surrounding the cells, an adaptive 
filter to smooth the surfaces and to fill in the 
holes on the cells, gradient computing method 
effectively to compute the pixel gradients of an 
image. These proposed techniques also can be applied 
to segment the objects from other kinds of images. 
Furthermore, watershed and distance transform 
techniques are used to split overlapping objects. 
Since the properties of the six patterns of IIF 
images are extremely different, the proposed 
segmentation method adopts different parameter values 
in segmenting the cells from distinct IIF images. A 
rough classifier is proposed to decide which set of 
the parameter values should be employed to segment 
the objects from distinct IIF images.

assist physicians, without relevant experience, in making correct diagnosis. As ANA 
testing becomes more popularly used, a functional automatic inspection system is 
essential and its clinical application becomes more urgent [2]. 
Roughly, IIF with HEp-2 cells can be classified into six different main patterns: 
diffuse, peripheral, coarse speckled, fine speckled, discrete speckled, and nucleolar 
patterns. Fig. 1 shows the six distinct autoantibody fluorescence patterns in IIF 
images. From an image processing point of view, the fluorescence cell belonging to 
diffuse, peripheral, coarse speckled, or fine speckled pattern normally includes only 
one connected region. On the contrary, the discrete speckled and nucleolar patterns 
contain mass and some bright spots [3].

Ideally, a fluorescent image [4] shows only the structure of interest that is labeled 
with fluorescent dye, while the responses of unstained cells remain unobserved. 
Specificity of dyes with respect to cell types is sufficient for identifying supporting 
cells and receptor cells. The application of an array of fluorochromes has made it 
possible to identify cells and sub-microscopic cellular components with a high degree 
of specificity amid non-fluorescing material. Many different fluorescent dyes can be

Cell culture [8] is the process by which prokaryotic, eukaryotic, or plant cells are 
cultivated under controlled conditions [9]. This process allows individual cells to act 
as an independent unit. In cell culture, the size and quantity of cells will increase 
during cell division, and the growth of cells will be constrained by culture variables 
such as nutrient depletion. Culture techniques have become an important and 
extensive part of biotechnology in applied research areas such as genetics, cytology, 
and pathology. Cell culture also brings huge economic benefits and prospects to 
agriculture, crop genetics, crop breeding, and food additives.  
Since the growing cells must be separated into two or more dishes to avoid 
excessive growth in cell culture, biologists need to know the precise number or 
density of cells. Quantity measurement is an important task in cell culture. In addition, 
assessing medium suitability, determining population doubling times, and monitoring 
cell growth in culture all require ways to quantifying cell population. Cell 
quantification also allows standardization for manipulations such as transfection or 
cell fusion.  
Generally, biologists count the cells under microscope one by one or utilize the 
chambers. The most widely used chamber is the hemocytometer, a device designed 
for estimating the number of cells in a given volume under a microscope. This device 
separates the whole-cell samples into several large, equal squares, and each large 
square contains many small squares. Counting the cells in several small squares or 
larger squares provides an estimate of the total number of cells. However, manually 
counting the cells on an image that contains an extremely large number of cells is a 
time-consuming, arduous, and inaccurate task. An automatic software system to count

page, DNA microarray elements, or even quantum semiconductor dots. First, the 
strategy converts the image into a gray-scale one and uses a morphological top-hat 
operator with a disk-shaped structuring element to smooth out the uneven 
illumination. Second, Otsu's thresholding method [11] is employed to determine a 
good threshold for converting the image to a binary one. Finally, this strategy 
computes the distance transform of the complement of the binary image, modifies it to 
force the background to be its own catchment basin, and then uses the watershed 
transform to extract objects.  
Althoff et al. [1] provided a cell contour segmentation method to cut off the 
neural stem cells from a time-lapse image sequence. The method is an iterative 
process for every image in the sequence and can be described as follows: 
(1) Use multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian filters to separate image background 
from cell regions. 
(2) Find the centroids of all blob-like objects in the image. 
(3) Select the centroids of the blobs that are most likely to be cells. 
(4) Use a dynamic programming to segment the cells.  
Tang et al. [6] also offered a method for severing neural stem cells from a 
sequence of images. This method first applies a Gaussian filter to remove noise from 
the images. It then performs fuzzy thresholding as follows: all pixels with intensity 
below a lower threshold tl are set to 0, and all pixels with intensity above a higher 
threshold th are set to 1. The gray level intensities between tl and th are linearly 
rescaled to the range [0, 1]. The chosen lower threshold tl=+0.3σ, where  is the 
mean value and σ is the standard deviation of the background intensity. Similarly, the 
chosen higher threshold th=+4σ is high enough to guarantee that the pixels brighter 
than th are really well inside the cells. Through the use of a fuzzy thresholding 
approach, the method becomes less sensitive to the exact values of these threshold

3.1.2. Run Length Enhancer 
In IIF images, cells are bright objects protruding out from a uniform dark 
background. However, some cells are often surrounded by a hazy fluorescent halo, 
such as the image in Fig. 3(a). The hazy fluorescent halo will make cell segmentation 
more difficult. Therefore, this paper proposed a run length enhancer to suppress the 
hazy fluorescent halo. For each pixel f0(i, j) located at the coordinates (i, j) on f0, the 
run length enhancer draws eight line segments l0, l1, …, l7, all of which pass through 
f0(i, j), and the included angle between lh and X-axis is 22.5×hº. Let Wr, consisting of 
mr×mr pixels, be a window on f0, where f0(i, j) is the central pixel of Wr. We call Wr

The run length enhancer then stretches the gray-level contrast of fr from 0 to 255. 
Fig. 3(b) is the fr obtained by executing the run length enhancer on image f0 in Fig. 
3(a). Fig. 3(b) explains that the run length enhancer can suppress the hazy fluorescent 
halo.

3.1.3. Adaptive Filter 
Fig. 3(b) shows that some cells are uneven and there may exist some holes on the 
cells in fr, indicated by a red arrow; therefore, the AIICS system adopts an adaptive 
filter to smooth the surfaces and to fill in the holes on the cells. Let Aveg be the 
average gray-level intensity of all the pixels in fr, Wa, consisting of ma×ma pixels, be a 
related window of fr(i, j), and Avel as well as Mina be the average and minimal 
gray-level intensities of all the pixels in Wa. Since cell pixels in fr are generally 
brighter than background pixels, the adaptive filter gives

Fig. 6. The example results obtained by the thinning and spur pruning operations 
Since the contrast of the pixel at the vicinity of the cell contour or noise is 
generally high, they may cause a false contour or a contour with the thickness of over 
one pixel. The contour of an object should be one pixel in thickness. The AIICS 
system adopts a hit-and-miss transform-based skeletonization (HMTS) algorithm [14] 
to thin the contour of an object so that the contour of an object is the thickness of one 
pixel. We refer to the eliminated candidate contour pixels as the redundant-contour 
pixels and the remaining contour pixels as true-contour pixels. We call this algorithm 
the thinning operation.

overlapping cells an overlapping area. The watershed algorithm is commonly used to 
split the overlapping object [15-18]. Watershed based segmentation can give good 
results for gray level images with different minima and catchment basins. For a binary 
image, however, there are only two gray levels 0 and 1 standing for background and 
cell. If two cells are connected together in the binary image fc, only one minimum and 
catchment basin will be formed in the topographic surface. In employing the 
watershed algorithm to segment connected cells, distance transform [19] is often 
adopted to preprocess the image to make it more suitable for segmentation by 
watershed algorithm, for assigning the catchment basins in the overlapping area. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distance transform [19-20] labels each pixel in an overlapping area with the 
distance of the pixel to the nearest pixel outside the overlapping area. Let R be an 
overlapping area in fc. For each pixel P(x, y) in R located at the coordinates (x, y) on 
fc, the distance transform can be determined by the following three steps: 
Fig. 9. The results of Overlapping Cells splitting 
(c) fm 
 
(a) Original image (b) fw  
20 
After that, fc is converted into other binary image fw. Fig. 9(b) demonstrates the fw 
obtained by running this watershed algorithm on the fc of the image in Fig. 9(a), 
where only the overlapping areas surrounded by white closed curves in Fig. 9(b) are 
further split by the watershed algorithm.   
There may be still some cells split into more than one region. The AIICS system 
tries to combine them. Let μA and σA be the average and standard deviation of the 
areas of all the object regions on Iw. If the area of object region Ok is less than 
μA–0.5×σA, the AIICS system merges Ok into one object region which is adjacent to 
Ok and has the longest common edge with Ok. After region combination, fw is 
converted into fm. Fig. 9(c) displays the fm obtained from the fw in Fig. 9(b) by the 
region combination. 
4. Rough Classifier 
There are six distinct autoantibody fluorescence pattern cells which have quite 
different fluorescence characteristics. To effectively sever the cells from the IIF 
images, the authors roughly classify IIF images into two categories, uniform pattern 
category and fleck pattern category. Most of the cells on an image in uniform pattern 
category are with coarse speckled pattern, diffused pattern, fine speckled pattern, or 
peripheral pattern, while most cells on an image in fleck pattern category are with 
discrete speckled pattern or nucleolar pattern. The nuclei of the cells on the images in 
fleck pattern category have bright spots. Since both category images have 
significantly different properties, the AIICS system will take a rough classifier to 
classify IIF images and use distinct parameter values to segment the cells from the 
images.  
Given an IIF image, the rough classifier first applies Otsu's thresholding method 
[11] to determine a threshold Tb for converting the IIF image into a binary image. A

Fig. 10. Example for GAPD 
 
GAPD applies the accumulated historical IIF images to train the most 
appropriate values of Tarea, rm , am , rm  , am  , and mb by using a genetic algorithm. 
The manually drawn cell regions are considered as a collection of ground truths. The 
relative distance error (RDE) [21] is often adopted to measure the segmentation errors 
of a segmentation method. GAPD will use RDE as the measure of fitness of Ch based 
on the values of Tarea, rm , am , rm  , am  , and mb encoded by Ch. 
Initially, GAPD randomly generates N chromosomes, each with narea+ rn  + an  + 
rn  + an  +nb binary bits. To evolve the best solution, the genetic algorithm repeatedly 
executes mutation, crossover, and selection operations until the relative fitness values 
of the reserved chromosomes are very similar to one another, or the number of 
iterations is equal to MAXRUN.

In selection operation, N optimal chromosomes are selected from the N 
chromosomes reserved in the previous iteration and N as well as 2×N  ´chromosomes 
created in the mutation and crossover operations respectively, according to their 
fitness. GAPD continuously performs the three operations — mutation, crossover, and 
selection, until the related fitness of the reserved N chromosomes are very close. 
Finally, GAPD employs the chromosome Ch with the best fitness in the N reserved 
chromosomes to describe Tarea, rm , am , rm  , am  , and mb in segmenting cells from 
IIF images. Fig. 10(a) is a chromosome Ch indicating Tarea=110, rm =9, 
am = rm  = am  =7, and mb=5, where narea= rn  = an  = rn  = an  =nb=4. Fig. 10(b) displays

modified hausdorff distance (MHD) [23], and relative distance error (RDE) [21] are 
often adopted to measure the segmentation errors. In this experiment, they are used to

In this paper, the AIICS system is proposed to automatically segment and count 
cells on an IIF image. The experimental results show that the AIICS system can 
effectively segment and count the cells on an IIF image, even though the 
characteristics of the IIF images are extremely different. In this paper, color selector, 
run length enhancer, and adaptive filter are provided to remove noise and to enhance 
the contours of cells on an image. To cut off the cells from an image effectively, a 
new gradient computing method is proposed to compute the gradient of edge and an 
adaptive threshold method is given to decide the most proper thresholds for detecting 
the cells on an image. In addition, rough classier is presented to classify IIF images. 
GAPD is presented to decide the most suitable parameters used in the AIICS system. 
These techniques can be also applied in segmenting the objects from other kind of 
images.

The International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control
（ICECC 2011）於二Ｏ一一年九月九至十一日在中國大陸寧波大酒店舉行。由
大陸寧波大學資訊科學與工程學院 (College of Information Science and 
Engineering, Ningbo University)主辦，並由 IEEE Advancing Technology for 
Humanity、美國University of Georgia、大陸Nanjing University of Information 
Science and Technology、大陸National Natural Science Foundation of China、大陸
Science and Technology on Space Microwave Laboratory，大陸China Academy of 
Space Technology、大陸Ningbo Association For Science and Technology等學術單位
協辦。 
此會議可說是一相當大型國際會議，並由Quantum Computing、Materials and 
Architecture、Environmental Protection and Energy Application與Machinery and 
Automation等四個workshops所組成，探討的主題可說相當廣泛。該會議同時也
邀請了六位國際知名學者，於會議中分別進行不同主題的keynote speech。該六
位keynote speakers幾乎皆是IEEE FELLOWS，且都是擔任許多國際知名期刊之主
編或副主編之職務。 
該會議共收錄超過五百篇資訊相關主題之學術論文，且將被收錄至EI 
Compendex的資料庫中。此次研討會有來許多來自各國的教育研究人員、專家學
者、教師與研究生共聚一堂，互相交流切磋，彼此交換研究心得。除了可豐富個
人的知識領域外，亦是一個很好的學習與成長的機會，且有助於提升本校的國際
能見度與聲譽。從中學習別人的優點也讓國外友人更加了解認識我們，能使學校
進一步達到國際化的程度。 
本人也於該會議中發表了一篇論文，題目分別為“Automatic Band Detection 
of 1D-Gel Images”，同時也受到相當熱烈的反應。該論文主要提議一如何從一張
1D-Gel image中，切割出非常微弱的DNA/Protein bands，或從許多已連成區塊的
DNA/Protein bands，該技術對於生醫的1D膠膜圖，可提供很大的運用。該會議
共進行三天的討論，同時也安排最後一下午至天一閣藏書博物館參觀。此行收穫
良多，與許多學者交換研究與教學經驗，也接觸許多更新穎的研究題目與領域。
然因經費有限，迫使本人須於會議第二天就得返國來。最後也要感謝 國科會 能
提供本人參加此次會議之部分經費補助，以便能順利參加此次會議活動，並獲許
多寶貴經驗與交流。

filter are provided to remove the noises and to enhance the contours of cells on 
an image. To cut off the cells from an image effectively, the new gradient computing 
method is proposed to compute the gradient of edge and the adaptive threshold method 
is given to decide the most proper thresholds for detecting the cells on an image.
