Abstract
In this study, CO2 was bubbled into Fe0-contained solution to create an acidic environment
favorable to reduction of aqueous nitrate under various water qualities. Results showed that nitrate of
30 mg L-1 could be removed from solutions almost completely within 30 min under the conditions of 2
g Fe0 L-1 and CO2 bubbling flow rate of 200 mL min-1. It was observed from the Fe0/CO2 system that
one mole of nitrate reduced by Fe0 led to the formation of 6.6 mol of ferrous ions. The removal of
nitrate increases with increasing Fe0 dosage, however, the removal makes no difference as the Fe0 is
applied at a relatively higher dosage. In the system with various water qualities, nitrate removal was
inhibited significantly in the presence of humic acid. Calcium ions strongly retard nitrate removal,
whereas chloride ions promote the reduction of nitrate in a significant way. Sodium ions impose only
slight inhibitive effect on nitrate removal. Water molecule in the studied system can be of significance
due to its competitive capability of electrons released from Fe0.
Keywords: alkalinity, carbon dioxide, carbonated water, denitrification, hardness, nitrate, zero-valent
iron.
1. Introduction
The elevated concentration of nitrate in groundwater from intensive agriculture has raised an
issue of concern about contamination of drinking water supply. Sources of contamination involve
chemical fertilizers to provide nutrient for cultivation, uncontrolled animal-feeding operations, and
waste contamination through storm and urban runoff. Excessive intake of nitrate could render
particularly the infants the risk of disease of methemoglobinemia (Walton, 1951). Many of the
physicochemical and biological processes have been developed for removing nitrate from
contaminated water, yet these processes might be either marginally cost-effective or detrimental due to
potential side-effect on water quality. Therefore, it is imperative to explore new technologies for
resolving the above issue of concern.
Chemical method of zero-valent iron (Fe0) reduction has been researched intensively for nitrate
removal from water in the past few years. Zero-valent iron (Fe0), serving as an electron donor to nitrate,
represents the most common metallic reducing agent since it is readily available at low cost and
nontoxic (Siantar et al., 1996). Recently, various research groups have demonstrated that Fe0 is an
effective reductant used for reducing nitrate (Siantar et al., 1996; Cheng et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1998;
Choe et al., 2000; Liao et al., 2003). Based on the literature survey, the solution pH was reported as an
18
concentration was determined by using the spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-1201, Japan) with
the light wavelength set at 510 nm (Standard Methods, 1995). The residual nitrate, nitrite, and end
product ammonium were analyzed by using Ion Chromatography (IC) (DIONEX-120, USA). In IC
analyses, 4 drops of 15,000 mg L-1 H2O2 was spiked into the above filtrate to convert Fe2+ to ferric
precipitate via Fenton’s reaction and then the water sample was furthered filtered using a 0.45 m
membrane filter disk to remove the iron precipitate from solution. Humic acid concentration was
measured by TOC analyzer (Elementar-liqui TOC, Germany). In addition, the pH, dissolved oxygen
(DO), oxidation and reduction potential (ORP) were monitored continuously by using a pH meter
(Suntex, TS-1, Taiwan), DO meter (WTW, Oxi 340, Germany), and ORP meter (Suntex, TS-2, Taiwan),
respectively.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Fe0 dosages
Figure 1 presents the effect of Fe0 dosage on the system parameters in the presence of CO2
bubbling flow rate of 200 mL min-1, including pH, DO, ORP, nitrate residual, ammonium formation,
and ferrous ion accumulation. The Fe0 dosages applied were 1, 2 and 4 g L-1. In Fig. 1a, the pH
dropped to around 3.5-4.5 rapidly within 5 min; however, it gradually increased to 5-5.5 in 15 min and
became quite steady afterward. According to the Henry constant of CO2, 3.78 10-4 mol kPa-1 L-1 at
25oC (Stumm and Morgan, 1996), the carbonated solution with CO2(g) at 280.7 kPa (operating pressure
in this study) contains 9.310-2 M CO2, and the theoretical equilibrium pH is calculated to be 3.69 in
such carbonated water system. This implies that CO2 bubbling is very efficient to provide H+ and can
maintain solution under an acidic condition. The reason of the pH rebounding from 3.5-4.5 to 5.0-5.5
is because of the consumption of hydrogen ions due to nitrate reduction (Reactions (1)-(3)) as well as
the generation of hydroxide ions due to reduction of oxygen and water molecule (Reactions (4)-(5)).
4Fe0 + NO3- + 10H+ = 4Fe2+ + NH4+ +3H2O (1)
5Fe0 + 2NO3- + 12H+ = 5Fe2+ + N2 + 6H2O (2)
Fe0 + NO3- + 2H+ = Fe2+ + NO2- + H2O (3)
2Fe0 + 2H2O + O2 = 2Fe2+ + 4OH- (4)
Fe0 + 2H2O = Fe2+ + H2 + 2OH- (5)
As presented in Fig. 1b, the initial DO ranging from 7.1 to 7.8 mg L-1 was nearly zero within
10 min regardless of various Fe0 dosages. As understood, oxygen in the solution may be stripped out of
the system due to continuous CO2 bubbling, and it may be also consumed reductively by Fe0 (see
Reaction (4)). As has been well understood, oxygen can act as a role of electron acceptor similar to the
nitrate in Fe0 system (Reaction (4)). If the amount of oxygen in the solution is comparable to that of
nitrate, oxygen can compete with nitrate for electrons effectively, and this may lead to the inhibition of
nitrate removal even to a greater degree. In regard to ORP, Fig. 1c shows that the initial values of about
200 mV, indicating an oxidative environment, dropped considerably to–651,–683, and -913 mV in the
presence of 1, 2, and 4 g L-1 Fe0 in 60 min, respectively. Theoretically, the more reductive environment
was created, the more rapid nitrate removal will be resulted in, as was evidenced in Fig. 1d. As is
seen from Fig. 1d, it appears a lag phase over the initial period of 5 min, where nitrate was removed
only slightly. This may be due to that the initial dissolved oxygen competes for Fe0-releasing electrons
with nitrate at a much higher rate, as is evidenced by the rapid drop of DO within the first 5 min in Fig.
1b. Another reason might be the time required to activate the Fe0 surface by the hydrogen ions since it
was used in this study without any pretreatment. Following the lag phase, the nitrate residue dropped
rapidly. With the Fe0 dosage of 1 g L-1, the nitrate was removed by 91% at 30 min, and 96% at 60 min.
As the initial Fe0 increased up to 2 and 4 g L-1, the nitrate was completely removed within 30 min. It is
noticed here that the two NO3- profiles with 2 and 4 g L-1 of Fe0 differ from the one with 1 g L-1
significantly. This implies that 2 g L-1 of Fe0 is sufficiently enough to remove 30 mg L-1 of nitrate in
20
experiments, chemical reagents of sodium carbonate, calcium chloride, and sodium chloride were
employed to investigate their impacts on the process performance. In most of cases, unless specified,
background species involve (1) organic humic acids and (2) inorganic sodium chloride, calcium
chloride, and sodium carbonate. In addition, when alkalinity species of sodium carbonate was added
into solution, the initial pH for each experiment in this Section was adjusted at around 7.
To investigate the effect of alkalinity on nitrate reduction by the Fe0/CO2 process, the sodium
carbonate was prepared and added into solutions at various concentration levels of 47, 94, and 141 mg
L-1 as CaCO3. Figure 3a presents the effect of sodium carbonate on nitrate reduction in the presence of
other background species. It can be seen that the nitrate removal profiles were close to one another. For
example, the percentage of nitrate removal at 90 min was 48% with the lowest Na2CO3 concentration
of 47 mg L-1 as CaCO3, and it was 54% with the highest Na2CO3 concentration of 141 mg L-1. The
percentage difference of both was in the least degree though the applied Na2CO3 concentration was
three times difference. It appears that the presence of sodium and carbonate ions results in insignificant
effect on nitrate removal under the studied background condition. As presented in Fig. 3a, the pH
values all fell within 4-5 for the three different sodium carbonate concentrations at time of 5 min,
remained unchanged for a certain time interval, and then rised up slightly in the final reaction period.
As is understood, carbonate will shift toward formation of bicarbonate or carbonic acid under the
acidic pH condition, which was created by bubbling CO2 into solution continuously, according to the
following reactions:
CO2(g) CO2(aq) (6)
CO2 + H2O H2CO3 (7)
H2CO3 HCO3- + H+ pK1 = 6.3 (8)
HCO3- CO3= + H+ pK2 = 10.3 (9)
Hence, it seems that carbonate species can be assimilated into the carbonated water system without
causing any significant impact on the Fe0/CO2 process performance. Under such setting, sodium ions
with single positive valence impose only slightly inhibiting effect on the nitrate removal.
As for the cation calcium and anion chloride, their individual effect was illustrated in Figs.
3b-3e. The chloride is frequently found in the groundwater intruded by the neighboring seawater, while
the calcium is one of the major species present in the solution with hardness. To further single out the
effect of chloride ion alone on nitrate reduction, various concentrations of sodium chloride was used in
this study, including 35.5, 106.5, 213 mg L-1 as Cl-. As shown in Fig. 3b, the nitrate removal
significantly increased with increasing NaCl concentration. However, the efficiency of nitrate
reduction became limited at the high chloride concentrations such as 106.5 and 213 mg L-1 as Cl-. As
has been described earlier, sodium (Na+) imposes an inhibitive effect on nitrate reduction only in a
slight degree (Fig. 3a). Hence, it seems reasonable to infer that the Cl- alone accelerates the corrosion
of Fe0, resulting in the promoting effect on nitrate removal. Choe et al. (2004) reported that chloride
ion in solution induces pitting corrosion of the Fe0 surface, which could enhance surface reactivity or
increase the reactive area of the Fe0 for NO3- reduction to occur.
To further clarify the effect of calcium alone on nitrate removal, experiments were designed by
using the solution conditions described in the caption of Fig. 3c. This figure indicates that under the
same chloride content (106.5 mg L-1) the residual profile of nitrate with higher calcium content, 60 mg
L-1 (--) shows a higher position than that of lower calcium content, 0 mg L-1 (--). In other words,
calcium ions with double positive valence exhibit significant retarding effect on nitrate removal. On
the other hand, if looking into the two profiles with (--) and (--), it was found that the presence of
chloride (106.5 mg L-1) enhances the nitrate removal remarkably under the same basis of zero calcium
content. It appears that cation like Ca2+ suppresses Fe2+ dissolution from Fe0 surface, leading to
inhibitive nitrate removal, whereas anion like Cl- pulls Fe2+ out of the Fe0 surface, resulting in more
rapid reduction of nitrate, in addition to its pitting effect on the Fe0 surface.
As concluded from the above, calcium and chloride exhibit their effects on process
performance in an opposite way. Knowing that calcium chloride dissociates into calcium and chloride
22
CO2 flow rate. On an average, 6.6 mol of ferrous ion are formed as 1 mol of nitrate is reduced by Fe0.
The increase of Fe0 dosage results in the increase of rates of nitrate removal and ferrous ion
accumulation, but the rate approaches a maximum and remains unchanged as the Fe0 dosage is
increased to a sufficiently large amount. Linear relationship between nitrate removal and ferrous ion
accumulation was observed. With various water characteristics, it is concluded that nitrate removal
decreased remarkably with increasing humic acid concentration. The blockage of reactive sites may
occur from adsorption of humic acid onto the surface of Fe0. In addition, calcium ions inhibit the
removal of nitrate significantly due to its suppression of Fe2+ dissolution from Fe0 surface as well as
calcium carbonate coating onto Fe0 surface if there’s the presence of CO32- in solution under alkaline
condition. On the contrary, increasing chloride concentration leads to the increase of nitrate reduction
efficiency. Chloride ions in solution inducing pitting corrosion of the Fe0 surface could enhance
surface reactivity or increase reactive surface area of the Fe0 for NO3- reduction to occur. In addition,
chloride ions may also pull Fe2+ out of the Fe0 surface, leading to a higher reduction rate of nitrate.
Other background species such as sodium ions imposes only slight inhibition on nitrate reduction.
Under the studied condition, water molecule was found to play an important role of consuming
electrons in a significant way.

Abstract
In this study, the Fe0/CO2 process was investigated for removing nitrate from aqueous
solution under different operating conditions such as CO2 bubbling rate (0-400 mL/min), Fe0
dosage (1-6 g/L), initial nitrate concentration (6-23 mg N/L), batch mode, and fresh Fe0
supplementing (0-1 g/L). Results show that the bubbling of CO2 flow rate at 200 mL/min was
sufficient for supplying H+ into solution to create an acidic environment favorable to nitrate
reduction reaction. It was found that sigmoidal model equation describes the S-curve
behaviors of nitrate reduction, ferrous accumulation and ammonium formation satisfactorily,
and the parameter t1/2 of the proposed model equation serves as a powerful tool for the
comparison of nitrate reduction rate. Sustainability test demonstrates that Fe0 powder began
to deteriorate after three batches operation. Concerning the operating modes, the batch mode
with the treated solution emptied and freshly refilled outperforms the one, which was
operated by retaining the treated solution and spiking concentrated nitrate into it for the next
batch treatment. To guarantee satisfactory nitrate removal using the former mode, supplement
of appropriate amount of Fe0 needs to be optimized.

1. Introduction
Nitrate contamination in groundwater is derived mainly from sources such as
agricultural land runoff, leaching of nitrogen fertilizers, intensive animal feeding operations,
food processing, and industrial waste discharge. It is urged that certain actions need to be
taken for numerous sites locating at the governmental and private facilities, where the
groundwater contains nitrate in considerably high level. Such contamination may sacrifice
drinking water quality and risk the public health. High concentration of nitrate not only
causes methemoglobinemia in the newborn infants, but also leads to formation of carcinogen
30
system (Millipore Simplicity, France).
2.2. Experimental methods
As shown in Fig. 1, the experiments were conducted in a cylindrical reactor of 1.3 L.
The liquid volume was 1 L. Internal recirculated flow by a peristaltic pump was used to
achieve homogeneous mixing of solution. The CO2 gas was introduced by passing through a
disk diffuser of silicate material installed at the bottom of reactor. As the experiments were
carried on, water samples were taken from the reactor at different time intervals for
subsequent analyses.
2.3. Instrumental Analyses
After pre-filtration of treated water sample, the filtrate was taken for the analysis of
ferrous ion. Ferrous ion was able to form a colored complex with 1,10-phenanthroline;
therefore, its concentration was determined through the spectrophotometric reading
(SHIMADZU, UV-1201, Japan) with the light absorption at 510 nm, which corresponds to a
certain ferrous quantity (Standard method, 1995). The residual nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium
were analyzed by using Ion Chromatography (IC; DIONEX-120, USA). In IC analyses, 4
drops of 15,000 mg/L H2O2 were spiked into the above filtrate to convert Fe2+ to ferric
precipitate(Fenton’s reaction) and then the water samples were furthered filtered using a 0.45
m membrane filter to remove the iron precipitate from solution. In addition, the pH, DO,
ORP were monitored continuously by using a pH meter (Suntex, TS-1, Taiwan), DO meter
(WTW, Oxi 340, Germany), and ORP meter (Suntex, TS-2, Taiwan), respectively.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. CO2/H2O system
To understand different characteristic aspects of carbonated water system (CO2/H2O),
deionized water without any other background species was used to fulfill this purpose.
Different profiles of pH, DO, ORP are presented in Fig. 2. The bubbling time period was
controlled within 40 min, and the CO2 bubbling rate varied from 100 to 400 mL/min. In Fig.
2 (a), it can be seen that all solution pH drop rapidly from the neutral to acidic range and
remain unchanged after 10 min. The pH profile indicates that the pH decreases with
increasing CO2 bubbling rate. According to Reactions (1)-(4), the source of hydrogen ion in
the reaction system was the bubbling of CO2 into the solution, and the ultimate equilibrium
pH depends on the absorption rate of CO2 in water. Fig. 2 (a) shows that continuous CO2
bubbling is efficient for providing hydrogen ion to create acidic conditions, which are in the
pH range of 3-4. In summary, the bubbling of CO2 was an effective alternative to create a
desired acidic environment for nitrate reduction. For example, Whitman et al. (1924)
observed that the iron corrosion rate at room temperature was greatly enhanced by lowering
the pH down to less than 4.
As illustrated in Fig. 2 (b), the solution DO decreased rapidly to nearly zero in all
cases, though, it took longer time to reach zero reading for the lower bubbling rate of CO2.
The dissolved oxygen was stripped out of the aqueous system by the CO2 gas. As a result, the
solution became anaerobic which was favorable for the corrosion of zero-valent iron
according to Bigg and Judd (2000). As shown in Fig. 2 (c), the ORP value in solution
increased slightly when the CO2 gas was bubbled into solution continuously. In general, the
higher the CO2 bubbling rate, the lower the ORP profile. Additionally, the ORP’s under
32
bubbling rates of 0-400 mL/min as well as dosages of 0-4 g Fe0/L, and the initial nitrate
concentration was kept at a constant value of 6.8 mg N/L. As can be seen in Fig. 4 (a), the pH
in all CO2 bubbling rates fell rapidly from the neutral pH to around 3.5 in less than 5 min.
Then, the pH gradually rebounded in all cases except the one without CO2 bubbling. As
depicted in Reactions (7)-(9), the reason of pH rebounding after their initial drop is due to the
reduction of nitrate by Fe0, in addition to water and oxygen-induced corrosion of Fe0
(Reactions (5) and (6)). Fig. 4 (b) shows that the DO value in solution decreased to nearly
zero within 10 min under different CO2 bubbling rates. As understood, the DO disappeared
because of CO2 stripping and its reaction with Fe0 (Reactions (6)). Similar to NO3-, the
dissolved oxygen can act as a role of electron acceptor, providing protection of nitrate from
reduction. In regard to the ORP, Fig. 4(c) shows that the initial positive ORP values for CO2
at 100, 200 and 400 mL/min were 158, 179 and 158 mV, respectively. After 60 min, the ORP
values dropped down to the negative ones of –501, –651, and -702 mV, respectively.
Furthermore, the final ORP values decreased with increasing CO2 bubbling rate.
4Fe0 + NO3- + 10H+  4Fe2+ + NH4+ +3H2O (7)
5Fe0 + 2NO3- + 12H+  5Fe2+ + N2 + 6H2O (8)
Fe0 + NO3- + 2H+  Fe2+ + NO2- + H2O (9)
As shown in Fig. 4(d), nitrate decreased slightly during the initial time period and
dropped down swiftly after 5 min for all different CO2 bubbling rates. The lack of nitrate
removal in the initial phase may be due to the time required to activate the iron surface by the
hydrogen ions. Following the lag phase, the nitrate residue was seen to drop rapidly. With
CO2 inflow at 100 mL/min, the nitrate was removed by 94% at 30 min, and complete nitrate
removal occurred at 60 min. In contrast, as the CO2 bubbling rates of 200 and 400 mL/min
were used, respectively, the nitrate was completely removed at the time of only 30 min in
either case. In addition, the residual profiles of nitrate show no difference for these two CO2
bubbling rates. Therefore, it can be implied that the CO2 bubbling rate at 200 mL/min was the
optimum one in the reaction system. According to Fig. 4(d) and 4(f), the results show that
nitrite (NO2-) was not detected in the treated solution throughout the whole reaction period,
whereas ammonium was the predominant reaction products. The ammonium occurred rapidly
when the nitrate reduction began, and its formation rate was reduced as the nitrate reduction
rate became slowing down. According to this study, the ammonia yield at the end of reaction
was 95-105%. Cheng et al. (1997) and Huang et al. (1998) reported that ammonium
dominates the reaction products in the Fe0 process. Under such a setting, a post treatment of
separating ammonium from treated water is needed if the reduction process of Fe0 is
employed for the treatment of nitrate-contaminated waters. As shown in Fig. 4(e), ferrous
accumulation increased with increasing CO2 bubbling rate. It is interesting to point out that
the initial lag phase for ferrous accumulation was observed for each CO2 bubbling rate. In
addition, the accumulation rate of ferrous appears to be in consistence with the rate of nitrate
removal, if comparing the respective profiles of Fig. 4(d) with those of 4(e). This is to say
that nitrate removal is highly correlated with the ferrous concentration in the bulk solution.
Thus, monitoring of ferrous ion can provide prediction of the degree of nitrate being removed
in the reaction system.
3.3.2. Effect of Fe0 dosage
To optimize the Fe0 dosages for treating different initial nitrate concentrations,
experiments were conducted to fulfill this purpose and the results were shown in Fig. 5(a)-(c).
In Fig. 5(a), the average initial nitrate concentration was 6.95 mg N/L. The nitrate removal
34
raise nitrate concentration to a level close to the one in the previous batch; and Mode 2:
treated solution was emptied and refilled with freshly prepared solution for the next batch
treatment, containing the same level of nitrate as the previous batch. With Modes 1 and 2, Fig.
7 presents the comparison between the paired profiles of pH, nitrate, ammonium, and ferrous
accumulation. All paired profiles were almost the same in the first batch treatment because
the experiments were conducted under identical conditions. Nitrate in the first batch was
removed completely from solution within 30 min, and the ammonium formation and ferrous
accumulation at 60 min in both modes were around 6.8 mg N/L and 225 mg/L, respectively.
However, in the 2nd and 3rd batches, significant difference between the two modes began to
appear. With Mode 1, the efficiency of nitrate reduction decreased with increasing number of
batch treatment. For example, the efficiency of nitrate reduction was 100% at 60 min, 86.4%
at 120 min, and 65.2% at 180 min. The decreasing of nitrate reduction efficiency might be
due to the following three reasons. First, the deterioration of nitrate reduction is caused by
that the pH in Mode 1 was seen to increase gradually along the reaction time from the lowest
pH value to 5.62 (60 min), to 5.86 (120 min) and to 5.98 (180 min), the pH condition of
which becomes unfavorable to trigger the nitrate reduction. As described earlier, the gradually
increasing pH was due to reduction of nitrate and water by Fe0. Second, the continuous
accumulation of NH4+ and Fe2+ might be the reason that the nitrate reduction is deteriorating.
For example, the ammonium concentrations were 6.0 mg N/L, 8.7 mg N/L and 12.3 mg N/L,
respectively, at times of 60, 120, and 180 min, while the ferrous ions were 200, 332 and 422
mg/L, respectively. These cations tend to suppress Fe2+ dissolution from Fe0 surface because
of mutually repelling electrostatic interaction among cations, leading to lesser capacity of
nitrate removal. Third, the available amount of reactive surface sites of Fe0 serves to explain
lesser removal of nitrate in Mode 1. In fact, the third reason also relates strongly with the pH
variation. As the pH continues to increase, precipitation of iron corrosion product is
accelerated and may occupy and coat on the reactive sites of Fe0 available to nitrate
reduction.
With Mode 2, the nitrate was completely removed from solution within 60 min in all
three batches. However, the nitrate reduction performance decreased slightly with increasing
number of batch treatment. For example, nitrate was removed by 100% in 30 min in the first
and second batch treatment, while the nitrate was removed by 100% in a longer reaction time
of 60 min for the third batch. As has been described above, both the rising pH and cations
accumulation lead to retardation of nitrate removal. With Mode 2, the concentration gradient
of Fe2+ between Fe0 surface and bulk solution became enlarged when the solution was
emptied and replaced with the fresh solution without any ferrous ions, and in turn this will
enhance the tendency of electrons released from Fe0 surface. In addition, the concentration
gradient of CO2 between gaseous bubble surface and bulk solution was also enlarged, leading
to acceleration of CO2 dissolving into the bulk solution and the pulling down of the pH
profile. Hence, with these two factors of concentration gradient, more reducing power in
Mode 2 was observed than in Mode 1. Yet, the activity of Fe0 was degrading as the number of
batch treatment increased. For example, ferrous accumulations were 222, 183, and 159 mg/L
in the order of batch treatment; the difference of ferrous accumulation between the first and
the third batches is significant. In addition, no lag phase was observed in the second and third
batches in the cases of both modes because the Fe0 surface has been activated from the
previous batch. Based on the above results, it is concluded here that parameters such as the
pH, background ferrous concentration, and the operating mode should be concerned, if this
process was applied in the groundwater treatment.

Three batches were conducted under the conditions of CO2 bubbling rate of 200 mL/min and
a recirculated flow of 1000 mL/min. The time for each batch was 60 min. The first batch was
conducted by using 2 g Fe0/L and 6.8 mg NO3--N/L. In the second batch (60- 120 min) and
third batch (120-180 min), the treated solution of previous batch was removed from reactor,
the iron residue from previous batch was reclaimed and then Fe0 was supplemented at various
dosages. In the meantime, fresh solution of 6.8 mg NO3--N/L was filled into reactor for the
next batch operation.

be taken for numerous sites locating at governmental and private facilities, where the nitrate
concentration in groundwater is beyond 10 mg N/L. In recent years, the chemical reduction of
nitrate has received widespread attention from many researchers (Cheng et al., 1997; Huang
et al., 1998; Choe et al., 2000; Huang and Zheng, 2002; Alowitz and Scherer, 2002;
Westerhoff and James, 2003; Liao et al, 2003; Choe et al., 2004; Huang and Zheng, 2004). Of
the chemical reduction processes, zero-valent iron (Fe0), serving as an electron donor to
nitrate reduction, represents the most common metallic reducing agent since zero-valent iron
is readily available at low cost and non-toxic. Nitrate reduction by Fe0 is a fast reaction under
acidic condition. The use of CO2 to supply hydrogen ions in the solution is promising in view
of its non-negative effect on treated water quality as well as a very common practice in water
purification processes such carbonation and re-carbonation. In this study, Fe0/CO2 process
was investigated for removing nitrate from aqueous solution, in terms of process efficiency,
process operation mode, and post treatment of the end product ammonium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Material and Reagents
Zero-valent iron (Fe0) of 10 m size (specific surface area 1 m2/g) purchased from Merck
KGaA, Germany was used without any pretreatment. The CO2 gas with purity greater than
99.5% was purchased from a local supplier. A nitrate concentration of 2.25.-23 mg N/L,
prepared from sodium nitrate (Merck KGar Germany), was used in this study. Solutions were
prepared using water generated by a Millipore-Q system (Millipore Simplicity, France).
Figure 1. Configuration of reactor for the Fe0/CO2 system.
Experimental methods
As shown in Figure 1, the experiments were conducted in a cylindrical reactor of 1.3 L. The
liquid volume was 1 L. Internal recirculated flow was used to achieve homogeneous mixing
of solution using a peristaltic pump. The CO2 gas was introduced by passing through a disk
diffuser of silicate material installed at the bottom of reactor. As the experiments were carried
on, water samples were taken from the reactor at different time intervals for subsequent
analyses.
Analytical methods
After pre-filtration of treated sample, the filtrate was used for the analysis of ferrous ion.
Ferrous ion was able to form a colored complex with 1,10-phenanthroline; therefore, its
concentration was determined through the spectrophotometric reading (SHIMADZU,

show no difference for the two dosages of 2 and 4 g/L, but the difference becomes quite
significant as the dosage was reduced from 2 to 1 g/L. In view of marginal benefit in nitrate
removal, the optimum Fe0 dosage of 2 g/L is recommended in the case of initial nitrate of
6.95 mg N/L. In addition, nitrite (NO2-) was not detected in treated solution, whereas
ammonium is the predominant nitrogen-containing species. The ammonium occurred rapidly
when the nitrate reduction began, and its formation rate was reduced as the nitrate reduction
rate became slowing down. Cheng et al. (1997) and Huang et al. (1998) reported ammonium
as dominating reaction products in the Fe0 process. As for the mass balance, ammonium
accounts for 95-105% of the total nitrogen.
Effect of initial nitrate concentration
To investigate the effect of initial nitrate concentration on Fe0/CO2 process, the initial nitrate
concentration was varied from 2.2 to 24.2 mg N/L. The experiment was carried out with 2
g/L Fe0, 200 mL/min CO2 inflow rates, and a recirculated flow of 1000 mL/min. The results
show that the curves of all initial concentrations exist a lag phase over the initial period of 5
min, where nitrate was removed only slightly. Nitrate was transformed almost completely
within 30 min for the initial NO3- of 2.2 mg N/L and 6.8 mg N/L. In contrast, the initial
nitrate of 10.4 mg N/L and 24.2 mg N/L reduced to 3.4 mg N/L (93% removed) and 4 mg
N/L (81% removed), respectively at time of 60 min. It appears that the normalized residual
nitrate concentration decreases with increasing nitrate concentration.

Figure 3. Effect of initial nitrate concentration on (a) nitrate reduction and (b) ferrous
accumulation. Nitrate concentration was in the range of 2.18-24.19 mg N/L. The experiment was conducted
by using 2 g/L Fe0 as well as bubbling CO2 at an inflow rate of 200 mL/min and a recirculated flow of 1000
mL/min.
According to Reactions (1) and (5), both water and nitrate molecules will compete with each
other for Fe0-releasing electrons, leading to the formation of ferrous ions. As shown in Figure
2(b), ferrous accumulation exhibited an exponential trend after the first 5-min lag phase. The
rate of ferrous accumulation increased with increasing nitrate concentration. To differentiate
the competition reactions with Fe0 between water and nitrate, ferrous concentration based on
the dominating stoichiometric Reaction (1) was calculated and plotted in Figure 2(b). The
differences between the measured and calculated profiles indicate those ferrous ions deriving
from reduction reaction of H2O with Fe0 (Reaction 5). By visual comparison between the
measured and the calculated ferrous ion, significant differences of ferrous profiles are
observed for the initial nitrate of 2.18, 6.66 and 10.38 mg N/L. It demonstrates that ferrous
ion generated in the system occurs from nitrate reduction when nitrate still remain in the
52
completely from solution within 30 min in both operation modes. According to the 2nd and 3rd
batches, significant differences between the two modes began to appear. With Mode 1, the
efficiency of nitrate reduction decreased with increasing number of batch. For example, the
efficiency of nitrate reduction was 100% at 60 min, 86.4% at 120 min, and 65.2% at 180 min.
The decreasing of nitrate reduction efficiency was due to the rising of pH. As shown in Figure
4(a), the pH level in Mode 2 was lower than that in Mode 1. This seems to justify why the
residual nitrate has a value lower in Mode 2 than in Mode 1 since lower pH is favorable to
Fe0 corrosion. On the other hand, the continuous accumulation of NH4+ and Fe2+ in Mode 1
might be the reason of deterioration of nitrate reduction. These cations tend to suppress Fe2+
dissolution from Fe0 surface, leading to lesser electrons available to nitrate reduction. In
addition to this, the rising of pH in Mode 1 is also one of the key reasons behind such
phenomenon. As the pH continues to increase, precipitation of iron corrosion product is
accelerated and may occupy and coat on the reactive sites of Fe0 available to nitrate reduction.
It is important to notice that the pH governs the process performance in a significant way and
needs to be monitored continuously in operating this process.

Figure 5. Effect of different operation modes on (a) pH and (b) nitrate reduction. The
experiment was conducted under the conditions of CO2 bubbling rate of 200 mL/min and a recirculated flow of
1000 mL/min. The first phase (0-60 min) was conducted by using 2 g Fe0/L and initial NO3
- of 6.8 mg N/L. In
the second (60- 120 min) and third phases (120-180 min), 3 mL of 10,000 mg/L nitrate solution was spiked into
the reactor at 60 min and 120 min, respectively (the operating Mode 1). In the operating Mode 2, the treated
solutions from the first phase were emptied and refilled with fresh nitrate-contained solution of the same
concentration level as the previous batch at times of 60 and 120 min, respectively.
Supplement of fresh Fe0
As understood from the above operating mode, the reduction efficiency of nitrate by
zero-valent iron decreases with increasing number of batch treatment, and the process
operation using Mode 2 outperforms Mode 1 on nitrate removal. With such understanding in
mind, it appears that supplement of fresh zero-valent iron is required to maintain a
satisfactory efficiency of nitrate reduction when the process is operated in a longer time
period. Hence, the experiment of Mode 2 was further tested by stepwise supplement of fresh
Fe0 during each batch operation. As shown in Figure 6(a), nitrate can be removed by 100% in
all cases, and supplement of 1 g Fe0 imposes the most rapid removal of nitrate in the third
batch. Without Fe0 supplement, the nitrate can be removed completely from solution in 60
min for the third batch, which is compared to the required times of 30 and 20 min,
respectively, with Fe0 supplements of 0.25 and 1.0 g. As mentioned earlier, Figure 6 (b)
shows that, without Fe0 supplement, ferrous accumulations were 222, 183, and 159 mg/L,
respectively, in the order of batch treatment. The accumulation values indicate that the

CONCLUSIONS
As a result, the Fe0/CO2 process is capable of removing nitrate of 30 mg/L within 30 min
under the conditions of 2 g/L Fe0 and 200 mL/min CO2 flow rate. The normalized residual
nitrate concentration decreased with increasing nitrate concentration (2.18-24.19 mg N/L).
Humic acid plays a role of inactivating nitrate reduction because of its adsorption onto
zero-valent iron surface. In view of different process operation modes, it was interesting to
find that batch operation mode (Mode 2) outperformed the spiked nitrate mode (Mode 1) in
nitrate removal when these were compared on the same basis. The key reason behind such
difference is the rising of pH in Mode 2, which is not favorable to Fe0 corrosion. In addition,
the measure of zero-valent iron supplement needs to be taken to guarantee satisfactory nitrate
removal in the batch operation mode. The appropriate amount of the Fe0 supplement applied
can meet the requirement of nitrate removal efficiency in the studied batch operation.
Moreover, ammonium as a dominating product in the studied reaction system can be stripped
out of the aqueous by adjusting the solution pH at 12 and by air bubbling. According to the
test run, when alkaline species NaOH was applied for pH adjustment and the air flow rate
was controlled at 500 mL/min, ammonium was stripped out of solution from 6.4 to 0.3 mg
N/L within 22.5 hr, 95% being removed. To shorten the ammonium stripping time, future
research should be focused on improving the system of ammonium stripper.

Abstract
Nitrate contamination in groundwater and surface water has become an environmental issue of concern in the
past decade, including eutrophication and health-related threats to human. To apply this innovative technology
in the in situ groundwater treatment or drinking water treatment unit, the compact reactor is favorable for easy
installation and transportation. In this research, attempt was made to combine the mixing tank of nitrate/Fe0 and
the Fe0 settling tank into one unique reactor among a series of continuous treatment units. Such reactor consists
of a recirculated pump used for complete mixing of reaction mixture in the first compartment and Fe0 recycling
in the second compartment. On top of this, CO2 gas is introduced into the first compartment through the venturi
tube valve. The results indicated that nitrate concentration of 23 mg-N/L decreased to 2.93 mg-N/L within 2.5
hrs under the conditions of influent feeding rate of 3 L/hr, Fe0 dose of 60 g, and CO2 gas inflow of 200 mL/min.
The supplement of Fe0 was designed at every operating time of 27 hrs to meet the requirement of nitrate
drinking water standard. As a result, 40 g of Fe0 was supplemented periodically for better practice of controlling
nitrate removal efficiency and ferrous accumulation.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, nitrate contamination in groundwater has become a serious problem because
of public health concern. The health effect of nitrate in drinking water is in fact related to
nitrite because nitrate can be microbially reduced to nitrite, which causes
methemoglobinemia in newborn infant by oxidizing the heme Fe2+ of hemoglobin or known
as “blue baby syndrome” (Walton, 1951). Additionaly, cancers and damages to liver and 
other organs by nitrite are convinced to be due to formation of nitrosoamines, group of
carcinogens produced from reaction of nitrate with amines, amides, and other nitrogenous
compounds (Menzer, 1993). Therefore, the U.S. regulatory health limit of nitrate 44 mg/L
(~10 mg-N/L) is applied as a safe drinking water quality standard in most of developed
countries (Waterhoff et al., 2003). Zero-valent iron (Fe0), serving as an electron donor to
nitrate reduction, represents the most common metallic reducing agent. This process receives
widespread attention from many researchers to treat nitrate (Cheng et al., 1997; Huang et al.,
1998; Huang et al., 2002 and 2004; Waterhoff et al., 2003; Liao et al., 2003; Choe et al., 2000

Figure 2. Innovative reactor for nitrate reduction by the Fe0/CO2 process.
Innovative reactor
Innovative reactor for nitrate reduction by Fe0/CO2 process was presented in Figure 2. The reactor
volume reactor was 12 L. Regarding the first compartment, the bottom slope was 75 degree in cone
shape to avoid dead-zone settling of Fe0. With such design, the discharge of recirulated flow at the
cone-shape bottom can cause complete mixing of Fe0 powder and CO2 bubbles. Then, the discharge moves
upward and passes through a weir toward the second compartment. The second compartment is divided
into recirculated and settling zones. The Fe0 powder from the first compartment is sucked into a
perpendicular tube by the recirculated pump and discharged back to the first compartment again. This
settling zone separates upward supernatant from the Fe0 powder, which is recycled back to the reaction
system through a cone-shape bottom design.
Process Operation
The liquid solution feeding rate was 3 L/hr by using a peristaltic pump. The recirculated flow
of 90 L/min was used for complete mixing of reaction solution. The CO2 gas is introduced
into the first compartment through the venturi tube valve with gas pressure controlled at 3
atm. As the reaction of all the experiments was carried on, water samples were taken from the
reactor at different time intervals for subsequent analyses of water quality parameters.
Water Analyses
After pre-filtration of treated sample, the solution was analyzed for various water quality
parameters. Ferrous ion was able to form a colored complex with 1,10-phenanthroline;
therefore, its concentration was determined through the spectrophotometric reading of light
absorption of solution at 510 nm, which corresponds to a certain ferrous quantity (Standard
Methods, 1995). The residual nitrate, nitrite, and the end product ammonium were analyzed
by using Ion Chromatography (IC). Prior to analyses of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium, 4
drops of 15,000 mg/L H2O2 were applied for converting Fe2+ to ferric precipitate (Fenton’s 
reaction) and then the sample was filtered by using a 0.45m membrane filter to remove the
iron precipitate from solution.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of Fe0 dosage
To determine the optimal Fe0 dosage on nitrate reduction, 40, 60 and 80 g of Fe0 were used in
the presence of CO2 bubbling with a constant flow rate of 200 mL/min and an initial nitrate
60
the nitrate reduction rate was slowing down. The ammonium yield agrees very well with the
nitrate disappearance on the basis of nitrogen mass balance between accumulated nitrate
removal and ammonium formation, the difference of which is within 5%. In Figure 3f, the
ferrous accumulation increased with increasing Fe0 dosages. It is interesting to point out that
the initial lag phase for ferrous accumulation was observed for all Fe0 dosages. It might be
due to the time required for ferrous ion to transfer from the first compartment, passing
through the second compartment, to the effluent outlet. Moreover, the activation time of Fe0
surface is needed as well for removing impurities from the surface of Fe0. The ferrous
accumulation rate in Figure 3f appears to be in consistence with the rate of nitrate removal in
Figure 3d. In other words, the nitrate removal is highly correlated with the ferrous
concentration in the bulk solution. Therefore, monitoring of ferrous ion can provide a good
prediction of the degree of nitrate being removed in the reaction system.
Effect of process operation
In the process operation, as shown in Figure 4, the operating mode was divided into 2 steps,
i.e., Step 1: the initial Fe0 of 60 g Fe0 was tested for 23 mg N/L of nitrate until its exhaustion
without any supplement of Fe0 in order to determine an appropriate supplementing time point;
Step 2: the supplement of 40 g Fe0 was introduced into the system when the effluent nitrate
concentration was higher than 10 mg/L NO3--N. This step was designed to control the effluent
nitrate so that it can comply with the standard. In Step 1, pH dropped at the beginning and
increased after 10 min.
62
Figure 3 Effect of Fe0 on (a) pH, (b) DO, (c) ORP, (d) nitrate reduction, (e) mass balance at
60 g Fe0, (f) ferrous accumulation. The initial NO3- concentration was 23 mg N/L. The
experiment was conducted by using various dosages of Fe0 (40-80 g), CO2 bubbling at an inflow
rate of 200 mL/min, and a recirculated flow of 90 L/min.
Then, it gradually decreased, similar to previous scenario. Moreover, it can be seen that pH
significantly decreased after 33 hrs because of the decreasing Fe0 mass in the system. The H+
consumption for nitrate removal by Fe0, as illustrated in reaction 1, decreased as Fe0 mass in
the system decreased; on the other hand, since the CO2 was continuously bubbled into the
solution, the H+ began to build up in the system, resulting in the decrease of the pH. Not only
can the pH indicate the reaction extent of the Fe0, the DO, ORP and ferrous accumulation also
relate to nitrate removal. As shown in Figure 4b, the increasing of DO value occurred when
Fe0 in the system diminished. As mentioned earlier, the decreasing of DO in the solution was
either stripped out of the system due to continuous CO2 purging or consumed reductively by
Fe0 (see Reaction (4)). Therefore, the DO in the system rised up in the later time period as the
Fe0 was used up completely.. According to ORP profile in Figure 4c, it is shown that the ORP
value changed from the negative to the positive, implying that the reductive environment was
diminishing in the system. As seen from Figure 4d, the nitrate removal rate decreased as the
reaction proceeded to a longer time period, particularly after 30 min. This indicated that the
residual mass of Fe0 was not sufficient for removing 23 mg N/L of nitrate to the desired
drinking water quality standard. In contrast, while nitrate removal decreased, the formations
of ammonium and ferrous were decreasing as well, as illustrated in Figures 4e and 4f,
respectively. At 48 hrs, the measured ferrous concentration was 22 mg/L, which accounts for
the accumulated mass of 43 g, as compared to 60 g at the beginning stage. The unbalance of
iron mass might be due to the formation of some iron complex species in the reactor and also
the Fe0 residue in the recirculated pump. By visual observation, it can be seen that the color
of solution changed from dark grey to light grey and to light yellow brown as the operation
proceeded for 40 hrs. This depicts that the Fe0 in the reactor has been utilized completely in
the reaction system. Prior to the occurrence of breakthrough, the effluent solution was not
colorless because FeCO3 (siderite) or Fe(OH)3 (ferric hydroxide) can be also formed in the
system. To ensure the compliance with effluent standard, it was found that extra Fe0 should
have supplemented at every 27 hrs rather than every 30 hrs for safety factor consideration. As
seen in Figure 4d, the supplement of 40 g fresh Fe0 at every 27 hrs can consistently control
nitrate to less than 10 mg N/L. Correspondingly, the ammonium formation was observed as
the nitrate was reduced by Fe0. In addition, the pH, DO and ORP as expressed in Figures 4a,
4b, and 4c were surprisingly steady after the Fe0 supplement. Therefore, the supplement of
Fe0 can be successful for maintaining the effectiveness of nitrate removal. However, the
optimal Fe0 supplement in the system should be carefully investigated in view of the best
marginal benefit and ferrous ion formation control. To accomplish this goal, 40 g of Fe0
supplement can be the optimum scenario for both achieving the desired nitrate removal
efficiency and controlling ferrous formation.

ABSTRACT
In this study, Fe0/CO2 was selected as an innovative purification technology for treating highly nitrate-contaminated saline
groundwater. The results show that nitrate of 23 mg N/L could be removed almost completely within 60 min under the
conditions of 4 g Fe0/L and CO2 bubbling flow rate of 200 mL/min. The removal of nitrate increases with increasing Fe
0
dosage. However, it is not significantly different when the Fe0 is applied at a higher dosage. The results of background
species show that calcium ions exhibit significantly inhibitory effect on nitrate removal. The presence of sodium shows
insignificant effect on nitrate removal, whereas chloride ions enhance nitrate removal remarkably. Therefore, Applying
Fe0/CO2 technology to treat highly nitrate-contaminated saline groundwater in northeastern region of Thailand is suitable
and promising.

2. MATERIAL AND METHOD
2.1 Material and Chemical
Zero-valent iron (Fe0) of 10 m size (specific surface area 1 m2/g) purchased from Merck KGaA, Germany
was used without any pretreatment. The CO2 gas with purity greater than 99.5% was purchased from a local
supplier. The nitrate concentrations of 30-100 mg/L (6 - 23 mg N/L) was used in this study. Sodium nitrate
(Merck KGar Germany) was used as the nitrogen source. Solutions were prepared using water treated by a
Millipore-Q system (Millipore Simplicity, France).
2.2 Experimental Method
The experiments were conducted in a cylindrical reactor of 1.3 L with the working volume of 1 L as shown in
Figure 2. The diameter and height of reactor were 5.5 and 55 cm, respectively. Internal recirculated flow
provided a homogeneous mixing for the solution by using a peristaltic pump. The CO2 gas with the operating
gas pressure of 280.7 kPa was introduced by passing through a disk diffuser of silicate material installed at the
bottom of reactor. As the experiments were carried on, water samples were taken from the reactor at different
time intervals for subsequent water analyses.
Figure 2. Experimental setup.
2.3 Analytical Methods
After pre-filtration of treated water sample, the filtrate was analyzed for quantifying ferrous ion content.
Ferrous ion was able to form a colored complex with 1,10-phenanthroline; therefore, its concentration was
determined by using the spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-1201, Japan) with the light wavelength set at
510 nm (Standard Methods, 1995). The residual nitrate, nitrite, and end product ammonium were analyzed by
using Ion Chromatography (IC) (DIONEX-120, USA). In IC analyses, 4 drops of 15,000 mg/L H2O2 was
spiked into the above filtrate to convert Fe2+ to ferric precipitate via Fenton’s reaction and then the water

Figure 3. Effect of Fe0 dosage on nitrate reduction under initial nitrate concentration of
23 mg N/L in the Fe0/CO2/NO3- system. The CO2 bubbling rate = 200 mL/min; internal water
recirculated flow = 1000 mL/min.
As presented in Figure 3b, the initial DO ranging from 5.8 to 7.1 mg/L was nearly zero within 5 min
regardless of Fe0 dosages. Dissolved oxygen in the solution may be either stripped out of the system due to
continuous CO2 purging and/or consumed reductively by Fe0 (see Reaction (4)). As has been well understood,
72
As shown in Figure 5, the nitrate removal significantly increased with increasing NaCl concentration from
35.5 to 106.5 mg/L. However, the removal efficiency became limited as the chloride content increased to 213
mg/L as Cl-. Since sodium (Na+) imposes only slightly effect on nitrate reduction, it is further implied that
chloride (Cl-) indeed accelerates the corrosion of Fe0, resulting in positive effect on nitrate removal. As
mentioned by Choes et al. (2004), the chloride ion induces a pitting corrosion on the Fe0 surface, which could
enhance surface reactivity or area of the Fe0 for NO3- reduction. Figure 6 illustrated that the reduction of
nitrate in the presence of calcium (Ca2+) was retarded. The reason might be that highly charged cations like
Ca2+ can suppress Fe2+ dissolution from Fe0 surface, leading to lesser reduction of nitrate. Similarly, the rapid
nitrate reduction with chloride ion can be explained correspondingly that anions like Cl- with opposite charge
are capable of accelerating the detachment of Fe2+ from the Fe0 surface. Therefore, the high chloride
concentration naturally present in the groundwater of northeastern Thailand can enhance the nitrate removal
effectively in the Fe0/CO2 process.

3.3 Issue of Undesired Byproducts and its Resolution
To achieve complete removal of nitrate, Figure 7 shows a prototype of continuous treatment system proposed
for further study in terms of system performance and cost analysis. This system consists of three component
units. The first unit is designed for the nitrate reduction by the Fe0/CO2 process. In this unit, nitrate will be
converted mainly into ammonium and the Fe2+ ions are expected to accumulate. To remove the Fe2+ from the
aqueous phase, the second unit employs the process of air aeration for iron crystallization. Iron species will
then be crystallized onto the surface of selected seeding material (e.g., quartz sand). The byproduct of iron
pellets from the second unit can be tested and reutilized for environmental application purpose. In the final

nitrate removal. Therefore, Applying the Fe0/CO2 technology is suitable for removing highly
nitrate-contaminated saline groundwater in the northeastern Thailand.

Theoretically, the more reductive environment created, the more rapid nitrate removal would occur. This is to
say that ORP value can serve as an indicator for nitrate removal performance. In Fig. 4.24(d), it appears that
78
80 g as well as bubbling CO2 at an inflow rate of 200 mL/min. The feeding rate of NO3- solution was 50
mL/min.
In Fig. 4.25(a), it appears that nitrate concentration remained unchanged within the initial period of 1 hr. This
may be due to the lapsed time for the treated nitrate solution transported from the first compartment, passing
through the second compartment, to the effluent outlet. In addition, it also takes time to remove impurities
from the Fe0 surface since it was used without any pretreatment. Following the lag phase, the nitrate residue
dropped rapidly. With the Fe0 dosage of 40 g, the nitrate was removed by 83% at 2 hrs. As the initial Fe0
increased up to 60 and 80 g, the nitrate was removed by 87% and 90%, respectively, at 2 hrs. Such a result
implies that the higher the Fe0 dosage, the lower the NO3- residue in the reaction solution. With 40 g of Fe0,
the nitrate concentration at 21 hrs was beyond the drinking water standard of 10 mg/L NO3--N. Therefore, the
Fe0 of 60 g was selected as the optimum dosage to remove 23 mg N/L of nitrate. In Fig. 4.25(b), the ferrous
accumulation increased with increasing Fe0 dosages. It is interesting to point out that the initial lag phase for
ferrous accumulation was observed for all Fe0 dosages. It might be due to the time required for ferrous ion to
transfer from the first compartment, passing through the second compartment, to the effluent outlet. Moreover,
the activation time of Fe0 surface is needed as well for removing impurities from the surface of Fe0. The
ferrous accumulation rate in Fig. 4.25(b) appears to be in consistence with the rate of nitrate removal in Fig.
4.25(a). In other words, the nitrate removal is highly correlated with the ferrous concentration in the bulk
solution. Therefore, monitoring of ferrous ion can provide a good prediction of the degree of nitrate being
removed in the reaction system.
4.2.1.3 Effect of NO3- concentration
To investigate the effect of initial nitrate concentration on Fe0/CO2 process, the initial nitrate concentration
was varied from 6.6 to 46.2 mg N/L. The experiment was carried out with 60 g/L Fe0, 200 mL/min CO2 inflow
rates. Fig. 4.26(a) shows that the curves of all initial concentrations exist a lag phase over the initial period of
1 hr.

Fig. 4.27 Effect of feeding solution rate on nitrate reduction (a) nitrate reduction, and (b) ferrous
accumulation. The initial NO3- concentration was 23 mg-N/L. The experiment was conducted by using 60 g
of Fe0 as well as bubbling CO2 at an inflow rate of 200 mL/min. The feeding rate of NO3- solution was various
from 50 to 200 mL/min.
60 g Fe0 can be applied for treating nitrate to below the standard value for 18 and 7 hr at 100 and 200 mL/min
of feeding rate and more than 24 hr at 50 mL/min. As seen from ferrous formation after lag phase as shown in
Fig 4.27(b), ferrous formation increased with increasing retention time. The increasing ferrous occurred from
the longer reaction time of nitrate and H2O reacted with Fe0. However, ferrous concentration at higher liquid
feeding rate will decrease rapidly than that at lower feeding rate. It might be due to the higher mass Fe0
consumption for NO3- removal occurred in higher liquid feeding rate.
4.2.1.5 Effect of process operation
In the process operation, as shown in Fig. 4.28, the operating mode was divided into 2 steps, i.e., Step
1: the initial Fe0 of 60 g Fe0 was tested for 23 mg N/L of nitrate until its exhaustion without any supplement of
Fe0 in order to determine an appropriate supplementing time; Step 2: the supplement of Fe0 was introduced
into the system when the effluent nitrate concentration was higher than 10 mg/L NO3--N. This step was
designed to control the effluent nitrate so that it can comply with the standard. The supplement of Fe0 was
varied from 30 to 50 g to find the optimal Fe0 for continuous operation in continuous. In Step 1, pH dropped at
the beginning and increased after 10 min. Then, it gradually decreased, similar to previous scenario. Moreover,
it can be seen that pH significantly decreased after 33 hrs because of the decreasing Fe0 mass in the system.
The H+ consumption for nitrate removal by Fe0, as illustrated in Reaction 4.3, decreased as Fe0 mass in the
system decreased; on the other hand, since the CO2 was continuously bubbled into the solution, the H+ began
to build up in the system, resulting in the decrease of the pH. Not only can the pH indicate the reaction extent

Fig. 4.28 Effect of Fe0 supplement on nitrate reduction (a) pH, (b) DO, (c) ORP, (d) nitrate removal, (e)
ammonium formation, (f) ferrous accumulation. The experiment was conducted under the conditions of
CO2 bubbling rate of 200 mL/min and a recirculated flow of 90 L/min. The influent nitrate concentration was
23 mg N/L. The operating mode was divided into 2 steps. Step 1: the initial Fe0 of 60 g was tested until
exhaustion, without any supplement of Fe0 (0 g Fe0 supplement). Step 2: The supplement of Fe0 such as 30, 40,
and 50 g was introduced in the system at times of 27 hrs and 54 hrs, respectively.
Prior to the occurrence of breakthrough, the effluent solution was not colorless because FeCO3 (siderite) or
Fe(OH)3 (ferric hydroxide) can be also formed in the system. To ensure the compliance with effluent standard,
it was found that extra Fe0 should have supplemented at every 27 hr rather than every 30 hr for safety factor
consideration. In step 2, the supplement of fresh Fe0 such as 30, 40 and 50 g was decided at every 27 hr to
control nitrate to less than 10 mg N/L. As seen in Fig. 4.28 (d), the supplement of Fe0 can assist to control the
effluent nitrate not to be greater than 10 ppm-N when 40 and 50 g of Fe0 was added every 27 hr. The
efficiency of nitrate removal increased after fresh of Fe0 supplement was introduced in the system. However,
the supplement of Fe0 at 30 g could not assist to control nitrate to below the drinking water standard. It might
be due to the mass of Fe0 in the system that was lower than during the first of 27 hr of operation. Regarding
other indicators such as pH, DO, ORP as shown in Fig. 4.28 (a), (b) and (c), at the supplement of Fe0 40 g and

Fig. 4.29 Effect of sand dosage on iron removal (a) pH, (b) DO, (c) ORP, and (d) total iron residue. The
experiment was conducted under the conditions of air flow rate of 5 L/min and a bed expansion of 0.25 from
original level. The feeding rate of solution was 50 mL/min.
The decreased of ORP value in the beginning stage occur from ORP value in the solution of Fe0/CO2 process
around -720 mV combined with solution in the iron precipitation process which have initial value as around
180-230 mV. The iron removal for different sand dosage was shown in Fig. 4.29(d). Ferric ion was completely
converted to iron solid form. In the first stage, total iron in the effluent increased slightly and remained steady
for 15 hours; however, it increased rapidly afterward in the second stage. Residual iron for 10, 15, and 20 kg
of sand within the first stage of 18, 30, and 36 hours, respectively, was not greater than 5 mg/L as compared to
the feeding concentration of 320-450 mg/L. As the availability of sand surface for iron precipitation was
limited in the second stage, more and more iron was leached out from the bed. It is necessary to mention that
the effluent irons in all scenarios were still higher than the drinking water standard of 0.3 mg/L. This might
be due to the shear force occurred on the sand surface as a result from fluidization flow rate. Bubble
generated from air can impede the coating of iron onto sand due to abrasion at the surface of sand.
Considering on the effect of sand size, it was found that size of 0.42-0.59 mm provided better iron removal
than “no classification” size (commercial sand). Although their performances on iron removal were different,
profiles of pH, DO, and ORP were quite similar regardless on sand size. Availability of sand surface is a
very important factor affecting on the coating performance. For commercial sand, 66% of the sand has the
size between 0.59-0.84 whereas 25% is between 0.42-0.59 as shown in Table 3.2. As we know, larger sand
size has lower specific surface area than the smaler one.  As a result, of the 25 kg of “no classification” sand, 
16.5 kg has the diameter in between 0.59 and 0.84 mm whereas only 6.5 kg has the size between 0.42 and 0.59
mm.  Therefore, it is not surprised that the iron removal eficiency of “no classification” sand was lower than 
those of 0.42-0.59 mm sand even it was supplied at a higher dosage. In conclusion, grain size for fluidized
material is a very important issue that needed to be considered for system performance. Particularly those want
to meet the drinking water standard. Air flow rate and bubble size which can impede the coating of iron onto
sand surface are also other important factors that needed to be taken care as well. Future studies are required
to investigate into more details regarding on this regard.

4.3. Field Testing Study
4.3.1 Nitrate reduction by Fe0/CO2 process
Nitrate removal between nitrate spiked in groundwater and RO water scenarios was compared. 40 g of
Fe0 in the presence of CO2 bubbling with a constant flow rate of 200 mL/min and an initial nitrate
concentration of 23 mg N/L was selected as the base conditions. The groundwater characteristic was shown in
Table 3.3. According to pH in Fig. 4.31(a), pH profile of nitrate spiked RO water scenario was observed to
drop rapidly from the neutral value to 5.7 in 10 min; however that of nitrate spiked groundwater scenario
dropped to around 5.9 at 10 min. The pH of profile in groundwater was slightly higher than that of profile in
RO water. It might be from alkalinity from water quality. Then, pH profile of RO water and groundwater
increased to 6 after 20 min and 6.2 after 1 hr, respectively. This was indicated activation of zero-valent iron
surface for the groundwater test was taken time longer than that for RO water test. It might be effect of water
characteristic such as dissolve organic carbon that might inhibit the surface of Fe0. During the operation, pH
profile gradually decreased and significantly dropped as shown at 27 hr for RO water test and at 30 hr for
groundwater test. The different time of significantly decreasing pH for two tests was related to the remaining
mass of Fe0 dosage in the system. The loss of Fe0 mass through its corrosion reaction in the system can lead to
less consumption of H+, therefore, decreasing of pH significantly can obviously occurred in the solution. As
presented in Fig. 4.31(b), the DO of profile dropped nearly zero within 5 min. However, DO increased when
the system was operated at longer time. It was due to the decreasing of Fe0 mass in the system. Therefore,
oxygen consumed by Fe0 was lower. In regard to ORP (Fig. 4.31(c)), the ORP value in the both systems

Fig. 4.31 Comparison system performance between NO3- spiked groundwater
and NO3- spiked RO water (a) pH, (b) DO, (c) ORP, (d) NO3- removal, (e) NH4+ formation, and (f) Fe2+
formation. The experiment was conducted under the conditions of CO2 bubbling rate of 200 mL/min and a
recirculated flow of 90 L/min. The influent nitrate concentration was 23 mg N/L. the initial Fe0 of 60 g was
tested.
92
Fig. 4.33(a), pH of groundwater was found to be higher than that of RO when air flow rate at 5 L/min was
introduced into the system. However, it can be seen that pH of the solution was around neutral pH, i.e., 7.6 for
ground water and 6.8 for RO water. DO of groundwater test and RO water test increased to around 11 and 10
mg/L, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4.33(b). Since the DO in the solution after nitrate reduction was nearly
zero; therefore, it can be said that oxygen from air flow was sufficient for oxidizing ferrous ion to ferric ion
which, it will precipitate later. As seen in Fig. 4.33(c), the ORP value of groundwater test decreased from 212
mV to -30 ± 20 mV from 149 mV to -50 ± 20 mV for RO water experiment. According to iron removal as
shown in Fig. 4.33(d), iron residual profile of groundwater test was higher than that of RO water test. Even
though, the iron concentration from Fe0/CO2 process in groundwater test was higher than that in RO test as
around 450 mg/L and 380 mg/L, respectively. The primary reason for low iron removal in groundwater test
might be due to the competition between iron and calcium precipitated on sand surface. CaCO3(s) and
Ca(HCO3)2(s) can form in the system with the high calcium-hardness groundwater (Chen et al, 2000).
Therefore, not only iron hydroxide was mainly found on the sand surface, but also CaCO3(s) and Ca(HCO3)2(s)
might begin to dominate on porosity of sand. Therefore, the application of iron precipitation in sand
fluidization for groundwater should consider the level of calcium because calcium might impede iron
precipitation on the sand. Regarding on nitrate as shown in Fig. 4.33(e), it was shown that nitrate profile
increased rapidly in the beginning stage.

Conclusions
Fe0/CO2 process was selected as an innovative purification technology for treating
nitrate-contaminated groundwater of Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science. The comparison nitrate
removal profile between RO water test and groundwater test showed that the residual nitrate in RO water test
was better than that in groundwater test. It might be due to the inhibiting effect of the water chemistry of
groundwater to nitrate removal such as dissolved organic carbon and Ca2+. However, nitrate removal in
groundwater test can occur more than 70%. It might be promoted by chloride that was found very high in the
groundwater. Regarding process operation, the 40 g Fe0 of supplement can be the admirable Fe0 supplement
for controlling nitrate removal efficiency to achieve drinking water standard at every 27 hr.
According to iron removal, iron residual of groundwater test was higher than that of RO water test. The
competition between iron and calcium which precipitated on sand surface might be the reason. CaCO3 (s) and
Ca(HCO3)2 can form in the system with the high calcium hardness in groundwater. Therefore, not only iron
hydroxide was mainly found on the sand surface, but also CaCO3 (s) and Ca(HCO3)2 (s) might begin to
dominate on porosity of sand. Therefore, the application of iron precipitation in sand fluidization for
groundwater should consider the level of calcium in the process because calcium might impede iron
precipitation on the sand.
Regarding on ammonia stripping, ammonium residual of RO water test was higher than that of
groundwater test. It might be the reason of ammonium concentration from the iron precipitation process at
groundwater test higher than RO water test as 17 mg N/L and 14 mg N/L, respectively. The precipitation of
iron solid occurred in the ammonia stripping tank. iron precipitation was obviously seen in the RO water test
more than in groundwater. At pH 12, all carbonate species would be in the form of CO32- which could combine
with Ca2+ and precipitated out in the form of CaCO3. By the same focus, magnesium could combine with
hydroxide and precipitate out. However, these divalent cations did not exist in RO water; as result, no
precipitate occurred in the reactor of ammonia stripping.

1. Introduction
Currently, zero-valent iron (ZVI) serving as in situ and ex situ groundwater treatment process is highly
interested for removing chlorinated compounds, heavy metal and inorganic contaminants (Kim and Carraway,
2000; Cheng and Wu, 2000; Alowitz and Scherer, 2002; Liao et. al., 2003). In our earlier studies, an
innovative Fe0-based process bubbled with CO2 to create acidic condition was employed to remove nitrate
from aqueous solution (Hsu et al., 2004; Ruangchainikom et al., 2005a; Ruangchainikom et al., 2005b). In this
process, a considerable amount of ferrous ion is derived from ZVI. Thus, it becomes an issue of concern that
how iron species in the process is removed and reclaimed for some other reutilization purpose.
In general, traditional process used for ferrous ion removal is chemical precipitation. Ferrous ion with
soluble form can be thereby changed into solid species such as iron oxide or hydroxide and settle out of
solution. The optimal pH for iron precipitation is a key factor to facilitate efficient iron hydroxide settling. As
understood, suitable pH for iron precipitation was around neutral and slightly basic pH. However, the settling
process is often accelerated by addition of a polymer coagulant, which gathers those particles of insoluble metal
compound into coarse flocs, leading to a higher settling velocity. Regarding the problem derived from
precipitation process, a large volume of sedimentation tank and a sludge dewatering facility for the removal of
moisture content are required to the pretreatment of iron sludge. Moreover, the disposal of dewatered iron
sludge occupies quite a large space of landfill. Therefore, coating iron onto media in a fluidized bed reactor
was selected as an alternative process in this study, while quartz sand with a great amount of specific area
served as seeding medium. As iron coated sands (ICS) become larger and heavier, the bigger ones will settle to
the bottom of reactor, which in turn will be drained out of fluidized bed reactor. Following this, fresh quartz
sand is then supplemented to maintain a desired process performance. According to the literature, this method
was applied to remove hardness (Van Der Veen and Graveland, 1988; Chen et al., 2000) and heavy metal
(Zhou et al., 1999). To eliminate sludge disposal problem, iron coated media can be further applied in water
decontamination processes such as Fenton oxidation and heavy metal adsorption.
In this study, H2O2 was applied in the coating process to convert ferrous species into ferric oxide or
ferric hydroxide. Specific experiments conducted include the effect of those parameters such as initial pH,
quartz sand bed expansion, sand dosages, and initial ferrous ion concentration. In addition, the iron coating
capacity of sand was also evaluated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Material and chemicals
ZVI of 10 m size (specific surface area 1 m2/g) purchased from Merck KGaA, Germany was used
without any pretreatment. The CO2 gas with purity greater than 99.5% was obtained from a local supplier. Two

acidified and analyzed by ICP-AES (Perkin Elmer，Optima 2000 DV). Micro-morphology and the surface
composition of the ICS were measured by a scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive
spectrometry (SEM-EDS, Hitachi S-3000N, Japan, EDS detector: HORIBA MOBEL 7021-H). Sample for
SEM/EDAX analysis was coated with a thin carbon film to avoid the influence of charge effect. The stainless
stand of the sample was covered with carbon tape to avoid its interference in iron analysis. The mineralogy of
the iron oxide coated on the sand was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (Bruker axs-D8 advance). Operation
parameters were as follows: Cu K radiations at 30 kV and 20 mA. The samples were scanned from 10° to 80°,
2θ, and the scanning rate was fixed at 0.1°, 2θ/s. In addition, the solution pH was monitored continuously by
using a pH meter (Suntex, TS-1, Taiwan).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Variation of solution pH during the working solution preparation
In preparation of ferrous solution by the Fe0/CO2 process, the solution pH drops fast down sharply to
around 4 at time of 5 min due to formation and hydrolysis of carbonic acid. The solution pH then gradually
rises up to 5.5 at 60 min, as shown in Figure 2. Before the Fenton pretreatment, solution pH was around
neutral. The increasing of pH was attributed to the hydroxide ion formation resulting from the corrosion of
ZVI in the solution, according to equations (1) and (2) (Ponder et al., 2000).
Fe0 + 2H2O → 2Fe2+ + H2 + 2OH- (1)
Fe0 + O2+ 2H2O → 2Fe2+ + 4OH- (2)
In Fenton pretreatment, the solution pH further decreased from 5.5 to 4.4 in 5 min when H2O2 was added into
the solution. The solution pH then increased gradually to be ? at reaction time ?. The related reactions resulted
in variation of the solution pH are depicted in equations (3) through (8). Of these equations, equation (3)
appears to dominate over the others (Pignatello, 1992). The products of Fe2+ reacting with oxygen includes
magnetite (Fe3O4), ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2), and ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3) as presented in equations (9)
through (12) (Kanel et al., 2005). Furthermore, hydrolysis of Fe3+ results in different iron complex species,
depending on the redox conditions and pH as shown in equations (13) through (17) (Snoeyink and Jenkins,
1980).
Fe2+ + H2O2 → OH + OH- + Fe3+ (3)
Fe3+ + H2O2 ↔ H+ + FeOOH2+ (4)
FeOOH2+ → OH2 + Fe2+ (5)

set at 6.5. It was observed that lower bed expansion ratio achieved higher ferrous removal. The ferrous
removal at 5 hrs was 70%, 60% and 50%, respectively, as the ratio was controlled at 0.5, 0.75 and 1. The
lower removal at higher bed expansion ratio can be attributed to the shear force between iron hydroxide and
sand surface. While turbulent flow occurred at higher recirculated flow rate, the shear force between iron
hydroxide and sand surface is higher, leading to a lesser amount of iron coated on the sand surface. Hence, the
lower recirculated flow rate for ferrous removal in the fluidized sand bed reactor is preferred. Consequently,
the bed expansion ratio of 0.5 was selected as the optimal condition for fluidized sand bed operation.
3.2.3 Effect of sand dosage
Regarding the effect of sand dosage on ferrous removal in the fluidized bed reactor, the results were shown
in Figure 6 under four different sand dosages of 200, 300, 400 and 500 g/L as well as bed expansion ratio of
0.5. The total ferrous concentration was 185 mg/L. The initial pH was set at 6.5. As may be expected, the
ferrous removal increased with increasing sand dosage. With the sand dosage of 200 g/L and 300 g/L, the iron
removal was 63% and 80% at 2 hrs, and 85% and 96% at 5hrs, respectively. As the sand dosage increased up
to 400 and 500 g/L, ferrous ion was removed by 98% and 99% at 2 hrs, respectively. It is interesting to
observe that the iron residue shows only slight difference for the two sand dosages of 400 g/L and 500 g/L.
According to kinetic analysis, it indicates that the first-order reaction kinetics is closely followed. The
resulting rate constants are listed in Table 2, which depicts that the rate constants increase with increasing sand
dosages (200-500 g/L). However, the increment between the two rate constants with dosages 400 and 500 g/L,
respectively, appears to be declining, when compared to the increments with lower sand dosages. This implies
that 400 g/L of sand was sufficient to remove 185 mg/L of total iron by 99% at 2 hrs. It is to say that applying
sand dosage in excess was not cost-effective to increase removal efficiency.
3.2.4 Effect of initial ferrous concentration
To further understand the effect of initial ferrous concentration on its removal in the fluidized bed
reactor, various initial iron concentrations with 126, 188, 252 and 334 mg/L were prepared from various Fe0
dosages of 1, 2, 4 and 6 g/L, respectively. The initial pH was set at 6.5. The sand dosage was 400 g/L and bed
expansion ratio was controlled at 0.5. The ferrous removal profiles with different initial ferrous concentrations
were presented in Figure 7. It can be seen that 97% and 95% of ferrous ion was removed within 2 hrs for the
initial concentrations of 126 mg/L and 188 mg/L, respectively. In contrast, the initial ferrous concentrations of
252 mg/l and 334 mg/L were reduced to 54 mg/L (78% removed) and 82 mg/L (75% removed), respectively at
time of 5 hrs. Based on the rate constants of different initial ferrous concentrations, as shown in Table 2, the
rate constants decreased with increasing initial ferrous concentration. According to the mechanism of
precipitation, the produced ferric species through Fenton pretreatment will compete with each other for OH-
available and for sand surface. It is possible that some of ferric solid will be combined together as a discrete
106
explained through the concept of the point of zero charge (PZC). SiO2 is the most abundant composition in
quartz sand and its PZC is around 2.9 (Sverjensky and Sahai, 1996). Based on such PZC, the surface charge of
quartz sand at solution pH 6.5 is considered to be negative. So, it is reasonable that the ferric species with
positive charge is easier to be adsorbed and to precipitate onto the surface of hydrated SiO2. In addition, by
digesting the IOCS and analyzing the total iron, the content of iron coated onto the sand surface was found to
increase from 0.45 mg Fe/g sand with 1 batch to 3.56 mg Fe/g sand with 11 batches. The recovery was 95%
based on calculation from iron removal within eleven batch operations. The maximum iron coating capacity of
sand can be used to predict the right timing for drainage of used sand and supplement of fresh sand, in view of
process operation.
4. Conclusions and recommendation
The ferrous removal from the Fe0/CO2 process was investigated by using the fluidized sand bed reactor.
Fenton pretreatment was selected for converting ferrous ion to ferric ion, and the optimal ratio of Fe2+:H2O2
was obtained to be 0.5. The results show that the optimum solution pH for ferrous removal after Fenton
treatment was 6.5. In regard to bed expansion, a lower ratio of 0.5 was preferred in order to achieve as a lesser
shear force of iron coated sand surface as possible, allowing the growth of iron precipitation. Such ratio was
controlled by adjusting the recirculation flow rate within the reactor. The results also show that 400 g/L of
sand was sufficiently enough to remove 185 mg/L of total iron by 98% within 2 hrs. As measured in this study,
the maximum amount of iron coating per unit weight of sand was 3.56 mg/g sand. Such iron coating capacity
can be used to predict the right timing for sand drainage and supplement, in view of process operation. In
addition, it was found that ferric hydroxide was the major crystalline of iron coated on the sand surface,
according to XRD analysis.
In view of application, the proposed method for ferrous removal also exhibits an additional advantage
for degradation of organic contaminants simultaneously, which are present in the treated water stream, since
Fenton oxidation reaction occurs in the reaction system. Furthermore, the reclaimed iron pellets produced by
the studied method can be employed as an adsorptive medium for the heavy metal removal.

(arsenite) in reducing environments [2]. As understood from the literature, the pH is a main trigger of arsenic
release from the solid-iron oxide phase.At natural pH’s, the arsenite exists in solution as H3AsO3 and H2AsO3-,
while arsenate is present as H2AsO4-, and HAsO42-. Under high pH conditions, arsenite is more strongly bound
to soil components than arsenate. In addition, arsenite is more toxic than arsenate and tends to be more mobile
in the environment. The mobility of As is a function of its oxidation state, with arsenite exhibiting greater
mobility through sand layers than arsenate.
Currently, there are several methods for removing both As(V) and As(III) species in water purification.
The USEPA report evaluated several commercially available technologies, including co-precipitation methods,
membranes, ion exchange, and adsorption [3]. Because of the treatment capacity of the coagulation process,
high cost of resins and the problem of membrane fouling, adsorption using low cost adsorbents has been
proven to be a suitable alternative, offering more reliable and efficient removal of complex inorganic and
organic metals than many other conventional methods [4]. Sorptive filtration by iron-oxide coated sands is an
innovative technology for treating drinking water contaminated by toxic metal pollutants. A number of papers
have used different IOCS such as Ce(IV)-doped iron oxide [11], iron impregnated quartz sand (IIS) [12],
silica-containing iron (III) oxide [13], sulfate modified iron-oxide coated sand (SMIOCS) [14],
iron-oxide-coated polymeric materials [15], and iron-oxide coated sand (IOCS) [16] to remove arsenic from an
aqueous solution. In third-world countries, the present focus on arsenic removal is the use of iron-containing
compounds because they are both economical and effective [17].
According to the study reported elsewhere [18-21], one type of IOCS was available from a nitrate removal
system by zero-valent iron (Fe0). Such IOCS was generated from a fluidized and air-aerated bed reactor, which
was designed to remove ferrous ions, produced due to the reduction reaction of nitrate by Fe0. After iron-oxide
coated sand pellets were formed and discharged from the fluidized bed reactor, it was naturally dried at
ambient temperature. With these iron pellets available, they were reclaimed and used for arsenic removal
purpose in this study. The idea of IOCS reclamation can be beneficial in view of solving solid waste disposal
problem as well as in providing another alternative of removing arsenic from contaminated groundwater.
Therefore, the primary focus of this study was aimed to explore the feasibility of arsenic removal by such
IOCS. In particular, attempt was made to investigate the effects of initial solution pH, adsorbent dosage and
arsenic content on the total arsenic removal. In addition, the adsorption isotherm model of this IOCS was also
tested in this study.
2. Experimental Methods
2.1. Material and reagents
Original quartz sand (OQS) was pretreated by soaking into the HCl solution (Merck, KGaA, Germany) of pH
1 for 24 h. Then, it was washed with DI water until the pH of rinsing water reached a value of 7, indicating the
quartz sand free of any HCl residue. As for IOCS, it was obtained from fluidized and air-aerated bed reactor
which used quartz sands as seeding material for the deposition and recovery of the iron oxide.
In this study, all the chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. All
glassware was acid washed and rinsed with DI water. The stock solutions of As(V) and As(III) were prepared
120
In this study, the micro morphology and elemental composition of original quartz sand and IOCS were
analyzed by SEM integrated with EDX (HITACHI S-3000N; Horiba EMAX, Japan). The specific surface area
was measured by nitrogen adsorption isotherm using the BET method with a surface area analyzer
(Micromeritics ASAP 2010, USA). The total iron was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optics
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Perkin-Elmer Optima 3000, USA). The samples were filtered through a
0.45 m membrane before analyses. And the total iron concentration of sample was obtained accordingly.
Total arsenic concentration was measured by "Hydride Generation Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Optical
Emission Spectroscopic Analysis" (HY-ICP-OES). A fixed volume of filtered solution was taken for arsenic
analysis. The KI/ascorbic acid mixture was used as reducing agent for pre-reduction of arsenate, and this was
to assure that the analyte is in the lower oxidation state before the hydride generation step [22]. The pH was
monitored for each sample by using a pH meter (Suntex, TS-1, Taiwan). To understand the characteristics of
the surface charge of IOCS, the pHzpc of IOCS was determined by mass titration method [23]. The oxide
/liquid ratios consisted of 0.01%, 0.1%, 1.0%, 5.0%, 10.0% and 20.0 % in the mass titration method.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 pHzpc of the reclaimed IOCS
According to the mass titration curve of reclaimed IOCS, it was found that the pHzpc of IOCS was about
7.0±0.4. This result is consistent with the pHzpc of most iron-oxide adsorbents, 6.5-8.5, as reported by Cornell
and Schwertmann (1996) [24]. In addition, the pHzpc of this reclaimed IOCS was close to that of an iron
hydroxide-coated alumina adsorbent, with a pHzpc of 6.9±0.3 [25]. Based on the pHzpc determination, it can be
deduced that the IOCS surface charge is positive, as the solution pH is less than 7. On the contrary, with a
solution pH higher than the pHzpc, the surface is negatively charged and there will be an electrostatic repulsion
between an anionic species and the surface of IOCS. Positive charge on the surface of IOCS may enhance the
removal of AsO43-, HAsO42-, H2AsO4-, and AsO2- through adsorption.
3.2 Comparison of arsenate removal by OQS and IOCS
To compare the arsenate removal efficiency by original quartz sand and IOCS, 3 g of original quartz sand
and IOCS were put into a solution of 300g l-1 As(V), with initial pH controlled at 5-8. As a result, the As(V)
removal by OQS was less than 3.4%, revealing trivial adsorption capacity. Such As(V) removal by OQS was
close to the data, 6.8%, reported by Zeng (2003) [13] using SiO2 and given the pH of 6.5. However, with IOCS,
the removal efficiency of As(V) ranged from 85.8% to 99.5%. Obviously, the enhancement of As(V) removal
by IOCS was attributed to the coating of iron oxide onto the surface of OQS.
3.3 Total iron release from the reclaimed IOCS
Leaching test was performed to measure the release of total iron from the surface of IOCS under various
initial pH values ranging from 5 to 8 to assess the binding strength of iron oxide which precipitates on the
surface of seeding material, quartz sand [18-21]. The results show that the final solutionpH’s shifting from 5, 
6, 7 and 8 to 5.6, 6.01, 6.24 and 6.42, respectively. It appears that al final pH’s approach to around 6.0-6.4,
regardless of different initial pH values. Possible reason might be due to the pHzpc of the IOCS which falls at
7.0±0.4, as observed from this study. Any solution pH values larger or lower than this pHzpc can tend to
122
led to the increase of removal efficiency. When the dosage of IOCS increased from 4 to 24 g l-1 and the initial
As(V) was fixed at 200 g l-1, As(V) removal was found to increase from 52.5% to 99.9% as the initial
solution pH was 5. When the adsorbent dosage and initial As(V) concentration were fixed, the As(V) removal
decreased with increasing initial solution pH. This tendency agrees with the deduction that higher pH favors
the formation of negative surface charge, leading to higher adsorption of As(V) onto the surface of IOCS.
Furthermore, the final solution pH’s were found to be around neutral condition, 6.0-7.1. The As(V) were in the
forms of H2AsO4- and HAsO42-. Under such condition of pH < pHzpc, the IOCS surface is positively charged,
adsorption of As(V) onto the surface of IOCS by electrically attractive reaction was expected. In view of
compliance with the arsenic standard, 10 g l-1, the minimal removal efficiency profiles were shown in the
dotted lines, as plotted in Fig. 2. According to Fig. 2(a)-(d), the minimal adsorbent dosage needs to increase
from 4 to 12 g l-1 at pH 5 in order to meet the arsenic standard, as the initial As(V) concentration increases
from 50g l-1 to 300g l-1.
3.5.2 Removal efficiency of As(III)
Profiles of As(III) removal under various initial As(III) concentrations, IOCS dosages and initial solution
pH’s were shown in Fig. 3. The As(III) removal efficiencies ranged from 59% to 79%, which are compared to
the arsenate removal of 92% to 99.5% (Fig. 2). The adsorption capacity of As(III) were 6.7 to 8.7g g-1 with
the conditions of IOCS dosage 24 g l-1, initial As(III) concentration of 300g l-1 and the pH range of 5-8. The
As(III) removal was found to be lower than that of As(V). Such result is consistent with the finding reported
by Bang et al. (2005) [28], who concluded that when the solution was open to atmospheric air, the removal of
As(III) was much lower and slower than As(V). In addition, the results also indicated that the lower the pH,
the better the removal efficiency of the As(III). In this study, adsorption capacities of As(III) decreased from
8.7 to 6.7g l-1 when the final pH increased from 6.3 to 7.1.
According to the literature, the dissolution constants of arsenite acid, pKa1and pKa2 were 9.2 and 12.7,
respectively. At neutral pH, As (III) exists in solution as mainly H3AsO3 and H2AsO3- marginally [29]. In this
study, the final pH slightly fluctuated between 6.3 to 7.1 and the pHzpc of IOCS is 7.0±0.4. The surface of
IOCS is a little positively charged and the predominant species of As(III) is H3AsO3. Only smaller adsorption
force was expected to occur between the surface of IOCS and H3AsO3. As the solution pH increased, the
amount of H2AsO3- increased by dissolution and the As(III) removal tends to become better due to its charge
shift [30]. Another article also reported that the As(III) was adsorbed to a greater extent than As(V) when the
pH was higher than 9 [31].
In summary, both higher IOCS dosage and lower pH were favored to obtain a higher removal efficiency of
As(V). Besides, the As(V) was more easily removed than the As(III) in the pH range of this study. For
example, 99.5% of As(V) was removed after 8 hrs with the initial As(V) of 300g l-1, the initial pH 5, and the
IOCS of 24 g l-1. In contrast, the As(III) was removed only by around 79% under the same adsorption
conditions. The pH dependence of arsenic adsorption is usually explained in terms of ionization of both
adsorbates and adsorbents [32]. In this study, the initial solution pH was controlled within the range of 5-8.
Under such condition, the surface charge of Fe(OH)3 solids will become positive, knowing that the IOCS
124
linearized form under various pH conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 6. In addition, the respective empirical
constants (a, b, n) of these two models are presented in Table 4. Note that the linearized forms of Langmuir
and Freundlich equations are expressed in terms of Cf/q vs. Cf and log (q) vs. log (Cf), respectively. As
depicted in Table 4, the As(V) adsorption isotherm fits the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.979, 0.936, 0.942, 0.977)
with a better degree than the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.906, 0.901, 0.841, 0.703) for the four different initial
pH conditions as well as the studied range of initial arsenate concentrations. The most useful aspect of this
Langmuir model is for obtaining the saturated adsorption capacity (SAC), while magnitude of the “b” is 
probably devoid of any physical-chemical meaning with respect to the forces involved in the sorption process.
Quantitatively speaking, the SAC’s of As(V) adsorbed onto IOCS were statisticaly calculated to be 22.1, 21.5, 
21.0, and 17.5g g-1, which seem to decrease with increasing initial solution pH values.
Fig. 7 shows the profiles of linearized form for adsorption isotherm of As(III). The correlated empirical
constants are summarized in Table 5. It is noticed here that the value of 1/q is much more sensitive to data
with low Cf value. Furthermore, it appears that the As(III) adsorption isotherm can be described more
favorably by the Langmuir model than the Freundlich model, according to the R2 values. The monolayer
adsorption of As(III) is also the major mechanism, similar to the case of As(V). As a result, the SAC (Q) data
of arsenite on IOCS were calculated statistically to be 12.6, 11.8, 11.5 and 10.5g g-1, which correspond to the
initial solution pH of 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively. This indicates that As(III) adsorption onto the surface of
IOCS depends on the pH, i.e., the higher the pH, the lower the As(III) adsorption. Compared to the SAC data
of As(V), 22.1, 21.5, 21.0 and 17.5g g-1, the As(III) is adsorbed by the studied IOCS with a less degree.
Fig. 8 shows the profiles of linearized form and Table 6 presents the empirical constants for the adsorption
isotherm of mixed arsenic species with equal concentration of arsenite and arsenate. Again, the result shows
that the total arsenic adsorption isotherm can be better described by the Langmuir model, according to the R2
values. However, the total arsenic removal can also be described by the Freundlich model, only with slightly
lower R2 values than those of the Langmuir model. The SAC data of mixed arsenic species onto IOCS were
calculated statistically to be 33.6, 22.9, 18.3 and 16.5g g-1, coresponding to the initial solution pH’s of 5, 6, 
7, and 8, respectively (Table 7).
With all model coefficients available from this study, Table 8 summarizes the comparisons of various
IOCS for arsenic removal by different researchers. In general, the performance of our adsorbent with SAC of
0.012-0.022 mg g-1 appears to fall in between those (0.008-0.136 mg g-1) obtained from various sources of
references. In view of specific surface area, the IOCS of this study is much lower than the others. In other
words, improvement of IOCS’s specific surface area can further enhance arsenic removal performance.
4. Conclusions
In general, the reclaimed IOCS was proven to be capable for the adsorption of both arsenate and arsenite
species within the pH range of 5-8. Such IOCS has a pHzpc of 7.0±0.4, indicating the positively charged
surface, which favors the adsorption of arsenic species in anion form. The As(V) and As(III) adsorption
decrease with increasing initial arsenic concentration. On the other hand, the increase of IOCS dosage led to
the increase of arsenic removal. When the adsorbent dosage and the initial arsenic concentration were fixed,

摘要
本研究主要是利用類神經網路(Neural Networks)多輸入多輸出系統的能力，運用於生活污水廢水處理廠
的放流水質預測模擬。根據實廠的實際操作參數和進流水質，以含有隱藏層的倒傳遞網路
(Back-Propagation neural networks)做批次式運算，預測實際的放流水質。本研究建構 5 種含不同變數的
模式，進行類神經網路的訓練和預測的比較，研究結果顯示，資料先經正規化處理有助於模式的預測
效能並能辨識是否含有不良變數，當含有不良的變數時，正規化後模式的預測效能將會降低。本研究
建構的 5 種模式中，其中預測 BOD 和 COD 的精度達到 82%和 88%的模式為最佳的放流水質預測模式，
當測得廢水廠當天進流水質時，運用本研究所建構最佳之模式，能迅速的運算而預測當天的放流水質，
幫助現場操作人員即時調整操作參數，以使放流的水質能合乎排放標準。
關鍵詞：類神經網路、廢水處理廠、倒傳遞網路。
130
(neuron)來模仿生物神經網路的能力。
經驗模式是對研究程序機構一無所知的情況下，將程序視作「黑盒子(Black Box) 」，僅僅
憑藉程序的輸入與輸出數據，透過數學技巧來決定程序的模式。此數學技巧指的是迴歸分析
(Regression Analysis)，即對所取得的數據作曲線擬合(Curve Fitting)[4]。
人工神經元是生物神經元的簡單模擬，從外界環境或其他人工神經元取得資料，並以數學
運算輸出其結果到外界環境或其他人工神經元。
3、倒傳遞類神經網路
倒傳遞類神經網路屬於監督式學習網路模式，是根據期望目標值與模式輸出值比較後，進
而調整權重值與偏權值的一種模式。圖2是表示倒傳遞網路的架構和演算法的例子，輸入神經元
2個，隱藏層1層，隱藏層神經元4個，輸出神經元3個，隱藏層轉移函數使用正切雙彎曲轉移函
數(tansig)，輸出層轉移函數使用線性轉移函數(purelin)，其中的演算法會以方程式(1)和方程式(2)
解釋。倒傳遞演算法是一種梯度下降(Gradient Descent)演算法，網路權重值是沿著性能函數負的
梯度方向移動，使模式輸出值與期望輸出值的差距趨近於0，若有差距，將誤差反向傳遞到各層
神經元的權重值與偏權值，藉由權重值和偏權值的改變，使模式輸出值與期望輸出值趨於一致。
Fig. 2 倒傳遞網路結構[4]
Fig. 2 的倒傳遞網路結構所列的演算法列於方程式(1)和方程式(2)：
a1 = tansig(IW1,1p1+b1) (1)
a2 = purelin(LW2,1a1+b2) (2)
其中，p1 = 輸入; a1 = 隱藏層輸出; a2 = 輸出層輸出; IW = 隱藏層權重值; LW = 輸出層權重值;
b1 = 隱藏層偏權值; b2 = 輸出層偏權值; tansig 和 purelin = 轉移函數。
倒傳遞演算法對於多層網路，其每一層的輸出將成為下一層的輸入，如方程式(3)：
am+1 = fm+1(Wm+1am+bm+1) m = 0, 2,…,M-1(3)
其中，M = 網路中層數目; a = 網路輸出; W = 權重值; f = 轉移函數。
轉移函數(Transfer
是模仿生物神經元Function) 模型的非線性處理機能，是從其它處理單元輸入的輸入加權值之加
權乘積和，轉換成處理單元輸出的數學公式。Fig. 為3 t 函數，ansig Fig.
為4 pu 函數，介紹如下：relin
132
toolbox。模式建立是以倒傳遞類神經網路模式為架構，建立五種使用不同變數的模式。訓練方
式是以整年度數據做批次式訓練和預測，由廢水廠所得的 2001 年數據做訓練，2002 年所得之數
據做預測，其預測方式是以當天進流水質預測當天的放流水質。輸入層和隱藏層的轉移函數使
用 tansig，輸出層轉移函數使用 purelin。根據文獻證明單一隱藏層的網路以可近似任何的連續函
數[5]，隱藏層若已有足夠的神經元，對於任何函數而言，單一隱藏層就足夠[6]。為了避免網路
過於複雜與造成掉落局部最小值[7]，而導致無法收斂，所以本研究皆採用一層隱藏層進行運算。
建立的五種模式如下：
BPN1
Fig. 5 為 BPN1 架構示意圖，輸入層使用 BODin、CODin、TSin、TPin、Temp、Flow 六變
數，輸出層使用 BODout、CODout、TSout、TPout 四變數。

三、結果與討論
1、 正規化的效果
研究初期建立 BPN1 與 BPN2，Fig. 7 與 Fig. 8 為 BPN1 與 BPN2 的 BOD 相對誤差圖，圖中
X 軸為時間(天)，Y 軸為相對誤差，平均誤差(Mean Error)的功能是為了判斷預測的相對誤差有
無常態分佈，由 Fig. 8 可看出相對誤差分佈比 Fig. 7 的來得大，由此可得 BPN1 經正規化後反而
相對誤差比未正規化還大。Table 1.為BPN1與BPN2有無正規化之R值，Table 2.為BPN1與BPN2
有無正規化之 MAPE，Table 3.為 BPN1 與 BPN2 有無正規化之 RMSE。由 Table 1.、Table 2.和
Table 3.發現 BPN1 經正規化處理後，反而 R 值、MAPE 和 RMSE 變得較差。在 BPN1 方面，判
斷可能是 BPN1 含有不良的變數，而導致經正規化後網路預測效果變差。而在 BPN2 方面，經
正規化處理之後，有增加網路效能的效果產生。由 Table 1.得到相關性最差為 TS，所以再建立
針對 TS 的 BPN3、BPN4 和 BPN5 來確定。

3、 網路模式的預測結果比較
以 Table 4.評估，整體看來最佳預測效能的模式是 BPN2，BPN2 模式的預測效果優於其它
模式，但缺點是每個輸出變數都要建立獨立的網路，而稍差於 BPN2 模式的 BPN3 模式，其 MAPE
和 RMSE 都與 BPN2 非常接近，其輸出變數較多，故判定 BPN3 模式為最佳預測效能的模式。
BPN3 模式使用的變數為輸入層為 BODin、CODin、TPin、Flow、Temp，輸出層為 BODout、
CODout、TPout，隱藏層有 100 個神經元。Fig. 9 為 BPN3 經正規化後預測 BOD 相對誤差圖。

四、結論
1、以上述結果得知，在資料代入不含不良變數的類神經網路模式訓練之前，先進行資料正規化
對於模式的預測效果是有幫助的，但在含有不良變數的模式中，資料正規化會明顯地降低模
式的預測效能。
2、類神經網路裡，輸入和輸出的變數對於網路的效能有很大的影響，所以應慎選具有相關性的

Abstract
In this study, Fe0/CO2 process was investigated for removing nitrate from aqueous solution, in terms
of process efficiency, process operation mode, and post treatment of the end product ammonium.
The results show that the nitrate of 30 mg/L could be removed from solution within 30 min under the
conditions of 2 g/L Fe0 and 200 mL/min CO2 flow rate. Additionally, nitrite was not detected in
treated solution, whereas ammonium is the predominant nitrogen-containing species. The
normalized residual nitrate concentration decreased with increasing nitrate concentration (2.18-24.19
mg N/L). Nitrate removal was inhibited significantly in the presence of humic acid. In comparison of
operation modes, NO3
- reduction efficiency with increasing number of batch operation in Mode 2
(treated solution was emptied and refilled with freshly prepared solution for the next batch treatment,
containing the same level of nitrate as the previous batch.) is better than that with Mode1 (treated
solution was retained in the reactor and spiked with concentrated nitrate solution to raise nitrate
concentration to a level close to the one in the previous batch.). However, to guarantee satisfactory
nitrate removal in batch operation mode, zero-valent iron supplement needs to be taken into
consideration. For example, the nitrate removal efficiency without Fe0 supplement is decreasing in
the third batch, compared to those with supplements of 0.25 and 1 g/L. According to a preliminary
study, the undesired end-product ammonium can be removed from solution by about 95% within
22.5 hr with the air flow rate of 500 mL/min and the solution pH around 12; the ammonium
concentration decreased from 6.4 to 0.3 mg 12N/L. Note that stripping time can be further shortened
by increasing air flow rate and using efficient air diffuser.
Keywords
Nitrate; groundwater; zero-valent iron; carbon dioxide
INTRODUCTION
Nitrate contamination in groundwater and surface water has become an environmental issue of
concern in the past decade in view of eutrophication and health-related threats to human. Hence, the
Experimental methods
As shown in Figure 1, the experiments were conducted in a cylindrical reactor of 1.3 L. The liquid
volume was 1 L. Internal recirculated flow was used to achieve homogeneous mixing of solution
using a peristaltic pump. The CO2 gas was introduced by passing through a disk diffuser of silicate
material installed at the bottom of reactor. As the experiments were carried on, water samples were
taken from the reactor at different time intervals for subsequent analyses.
Analytical methods
After pre-filtration of treated sample, the filtrate was used for the analysis of ferrous ion. Ferrous
ion was able to form a colored complex with 1,10-phenanthroline; therefore, its concentration was
determined through the spectrophotometric reading (SHIMADZU, UV-1201, Japan) of light
absorption of solution at 510 nm, which corresponds to a certain ferrous quantity (Standard method,
1995). The residual nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium were analyzed by using Ion Chromatography (IC;
DIONEX-120, USA). In IC analyses, 4 drops of 15,000 mg/L H2O2 was spiked into the above
filtrate to convert Fe2+ to ferric precipitate (Fenton’s reaction) and then the water sample was
furthered filtered using a 0.45 m membrane filter to remove the iron precipitate from solution. In
addition, the pH, DO, ORP were monitored continuously by using a pH meter (Suntex, TS-1,
Taiwan), DO meter (WTW, Oxi 340, Germany), and ORP meter (Suntex, TS-2, Taiwan),
respectively.
RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Effect of Fe0 dosages
The nitrate reduction profiles with different initial iron dosages were presented in Figure 2. The
initial NO3- concentration was 6.95 mg N/L. As can be seen from Figure 2 (a), the pH trends for all
Fe0 dosages dropped sharply to an acidic value of around 3.5-4.5. Then, the pH increased gradually
and became steady around pH 5.0-5.5. The rebounding pH is due to the hydroxyl ion produced from

200 mL/min CO2 inflow rates, and a recirculated flow of 1000 mL/min. The results show that the
curves of all initial concentrations exist a lag phase over the initial period of 5 min, where nitrate
was removed only slightly. Nitrate was transformed almost completely within 30 min for the initial
NO3- of 2.2 mg N/L and 6.8 mg N/L. In contrast, the initial nitrate of 10.4 mg N/L and 24.2 mg N/L
reduced to 3.4 mg N/L (93% removed) and 4 mg N/L (81% removed), respectively at time of 60
min. It appears that the normalized residual nitrate concentration decreases with increasing nitrate
concentration.

Figure 3. Effect of initial nitrate concentration on (a) nitrate reduction and (b) ferrous
accumulation. Nitrate concentration was in the range of 2.18-24.19 mg N/L. The experiment was conducted by
using 2 g/L Fe0 as well as bubbling CO2 at an inflow rate of 200 mL/min and a recirculated flow of 1000 mL/min.
According to Reactions (1) and (5), both water and nitrate molecules will compete with each other
for Fe0-releasing electrons, leading to the formation of ferrous ions. As shown in Figure 2(b),
ferrous accumulation exhibited an exponential trend after the first 5-min lag phase. The rate of
ferrous accumulation increased with increasing nitrate concentration. To differentiate the
competition reactions with Fe0 between water and nitrate, ferrous concentration based on the
dominating stoichiometric Reaction (1) was calculated and plotted in Figure 2(b). The differences
between the measured and calculated profiles indicate those ferrous ions deriving from reduction
reaction of H2O with Fe0 (Reaction 5). By visual comparison between the measured and the
calculated ferrous ion, significant differences of ferrous profiles are observed for the initial nitrate
of 2.18, 6.66 and 10.38 mg N/L. It demonstrates that ferrous ion generated in the system occurs
from nitrate reduction when nitrate still remain in the solution. However, ferrous ion generated after
20 min or 30 min should be primarily due to water reduction since the corresponding nitrate
residues were very low or near to zero. In addition, it was observed that the calculated ferrous
treated solution was retained in the reactor and spiked with concentrated nitrate solution to raise
nitrate concentration to a level close to the one in the previous batch; and Mode2: the treated
solution was emptied and refilled with freshly prepared solution for the next batch treatment,
containing the same level of nitrate as the previous batch. The profiles of pH and nitrate were
almost the same in the first batch treatment because the experiments were conducted under identical
conditions. Note that nitrate in the first batch could be removed completely from solution within 30
min in both operation modes. According to the 2nd and 3rd batches, significant differences between
the two modes began to appear. With Mode 1, the efficiency of nitrate reduction decreased with
increasing number of batch. For example, the efficiency of nitrate reduction was 100% at 60 min,
86.4% at 120 min, and 65.2% at 180 min. The decreasing of nitrate reduction efficiency was due to
the rising of pH. As shown in Figure 4(a), the pH level in Mode 2 was lower than that in Mode 1.
This seems to justify why the residual nitrate has a value lower in Mode 2 than in Mode 1 since
lower pH is favorable to Fe0 corrosion. On the other hand, the continuous accumulation of NH4+
and Fe2+ in Mode 1 might be the reason of deterioration of nitrate reduction. These cations tend to
suppress Fe2+ dissolution from Fe0 surface, leading to lesser electrons available to nitrate reduction.
In addition to this, the rising of pH in Mode 1 is also one of the key reasons behind such
phenomenon. As the pH continues to increase, precipitation of iron corrosion product is accelerated
and may occupy and coat on the reactive sites of Fe0 available to nitrate reduction. It is important to
notice that the pH governs the process performance in a significant way and needs to be monitored
continuously in operating this process.

and third phases (120-180 min), 3 mL of 10,000 mg/L nitrate solution was spiked into the reactor at 60 min and 120 min,
respectively (the operating Mode 1). In the operating Mode 2, the treated solutions from the first phase were emptied

120 min, respectively.
as sodium hydroxide was applied to increase the solution pH up to around 12; the ammonium
concentration was reduced from 6.4 to 0.3 mg N/L. Hence, it is feasible that the end product
ammonium in the reaction system of Fe0/CO2 can be removed by air stripping under the condition
of adjusted solution pH value higher than its pKa 9.3. When further applied to field operation,
ammonium can be removed by improving stripping facilities to shorten the stripping time.

especially significant in acidic solution (Piron, 1991). Generally, the application of acids such as
H2SO4 (Huang et al., 1998), HCl and acetic acid (Cheng et al., 1997) was used to speed up the rate
of nitrate removal. However, the presence of these alien species of sulfate, chloride and acetate will
risk the drinking water quality of treated water. To avoid such disadvantage, the use of CO2 to
supply hydrogen ions in the solution is promising in view of its non-negative effect on treated water
quality as well as a very common practice in water purification processes such as carbonation and
re-carbonation. In view of process operation, both mixing tank and Fe0 settling tank are needed for
Fe0 process, as shown in Figure 1. As a result, it takes up more space for two tanks and costs more
on construction. However, to apply this innovative technology in groundwater treatment units, a
compact reactor is favorable for easy installation and transportation.
Figure 1. Traditional reactor for Fe0 process
In this research, attempt was made to combine the mixing tank of nitrate/Fe0 and the Fe0 settling
tank into one unique reactor among a series of continuous treatment units, as shown in Figure 2.
Such reactor consists of a recirculated pump used for complete mixing of reaction mixture in the
first compartment and Fe0 recycling in the second compartment. On top of this, CO2 gas is
introduced into the first compartment through the venturi tube valve. The application of innovative
reactor was investigated for removing nitrate from aqueous solution, in terms of process efficiency
and process operation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Water Analyses
After pre-filtration of treated sample, the solution was analyzed for various water quality parameters.
Ferrous ion was able to form a colored complex with 1,10-phenanthroline; therefore, its
concentration was determined through the spectrophotometric reading of light absorption of
solution at 510 nm, which corresponds to a certain ferrous quantity (Standard Methods, 1995). The
residual nitrate, nitrite, and the end product ammonium were analyzed by using Ion
Chromatography (IC). Prior to analyses of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium, 4 drops of 15,000 mg/L
H2O2 were applied for converting Fe2+ to ferric precipitate (Fenton’s reaction) and thenthe sample
was filtered by using a 0.45m membrane filter to remove the iron precipitate from solution.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of Fe0 dosage
To determine the optimal Fe0 dosage on nitrate reduction, 40, 60 and 80 g of Fe0 were used in the
presence of CO2 bubbling with a constant flow rate of 200 mL/min and an initial nitrate
concentration of 23 mg N/L. The effect of Fe0 on the system parameters including pH, DO, ORP,
nitrate residual, ammonium, and ferrous accumulation was shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3a, the pH
profiles of different Fe0 dosage at 40, 60 and 80 g were observed to drop rapidly from the neutral
value to 5.41, 5.74, and 5.48, respectively, within 10 min; however, the pH’s increased to 5.9, 5.90,
and 5.96 in the next 20 min, respectively. Furthermore, the pH profile with 40 g Fe0 decreased
gradually after 20 min. In contrast, the pH profiles with 60 g and 80 g Fe0 went up to 6.01 and 6.07,
respectively. Then, both profiles became decreasing gradually. The decreasing profile of pH in the
initial phase may be due to the dominating acidification reaction of CO2 bubbling since zero-valent
iron surface has not yet been activated. However, the reason for the pH rebounding is the
consumption of hydrogen ions due to nitrate reduction (Reactions (1)-(3)) as well as the generation
of hydroxide ions due to reduction of oxygen and water molecule (Reactions (4)-(5)).
