          ABSTRACT 
 
Indium nitride (InN) epilayers have been successfully grown on Si (111) substrates 
with low-temperature (450°C) grown InN and high-temperature (1050ºC) grown AlN 
(InN/AlN) double-buffer layers by atmospheric-pressure metal-organic chemical vapor 
deposition (AP-MOCVD). X-ray diffraction characterizations indicated that highly 
(0001)-oriented hexagonal InN was grown on Si (111) substrate. Hall measurements 
showed the mobility and carrier concentration were 87.2 cm2/V-s and (7-8) × 1019 cm-3, 
respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) analyses performed at room temperature showed a 
strong emission at 0.72 eV with a full-width at half-maximum of 121 meV. Excitation 
intensity dependent measurements demonstrated the PL mechanism to be the band-to-band 
transition. Time-resolved PL could be fitted by a single exponential exhibiting an ordered 
film and a recombination lifetime of around 0.85 ns. In particular, transmission electron 
microscopy characterizations indicated that the use of AlN first buffer is very important to 
achieve a structurally uniform (0001)-oriented InN epilayer on Si (111) by AP-MOCVD.

[NH3]/[TMA] and [NH3]/[TMI] being maintained at 104 and 4×104, respectively. The 
substrates used in this experiment were cut from (111)-oriented Si wafers with 2-inch 
diameter. These wafers show n-type conductivity with the carrier concentration around 
1017 cm-3. Prior to growth, the Si (111) substrate was etched by boiling it in H2SO4:H2O2 = 
3:1 for 15 minutes and then dipped in HF solution (HF: H2O = 1:10) for 15 s to remove 
native oxide formed on the surface. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of our epitaxial structure 
using InN/AlN double buffers (denoted as sample A). First two thin films of AlN and InN 
were deposited in that order at 1050°C for 5 min and 450°C for 8 min, respectively, to 
form an InN/AlN double-buffer structure. Finally, the top InN layer with a total thickness 
of approximately 250-300 nm was grown at 580°C in an N2 atmosphere and with the 
molar ratio of [NH3]/[TMI] = 6 × 104. In addition, the growth of InN using an InN single 
buffer (denoted as sample B) was also conducted for comparison. The room temperature 
electron concentration for samples A and B are (3.2 – 3.8)×1018 and (8 – 9) ×1023 cm-3, 
respectively, while mobilities are 124 -133 cm2/V-s for sample A and 85 – 258 cm2/V-s for 
sample B, as determined by Hall measurements. The crystalline quality was evaluated by 
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Cu Kα radiation was used as the X-ray source. The 
optical properties were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements performed 
at both room temperature and 10 K, which were excited with the 488 nm line of an Argon 
laser at excitation power densities of 6.58 - 8.28 W/cm2. Besides, the recombination 
lifetime was determined from the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) conducted at 
10 K. In this case, the signal was excited by a semiconductor laser (λ=976 nm) with a 
pulse width of about 56 ps and a power density of 1.27 W/cm2. For PL and TRPL 
measurements, the luminescence was dispersed by a 0.5 m monochromator, and was 
detected by an air-cooled extended InGaAs detector (with a cutoff wavelength of 2.1 μm). 
Furthermore, detailed structure of the InN epifilms thus grown was examined by 
cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area diffraction 
(SAD) analysis. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of sample A. Obviously beside the Si (111) peak at 2θ 
= 28.5°, the X-ray diffraction peaks of 31.6° and 65.6° were obtained from the (0002) and 
(0004) InN, respectively. A discrete diffraction spot with two fold symmetry shows highly 
(0001)-oriented hexagonal InN crystals were grown on the Si (111) substrate despite the 
weak diffraction peak at 2θ = 33.1°, which has been assigned to the appearance of (101) 
plane of metallic In by Shubina et al. [23]. No other InN phases showing polycrystalline 
nature of the film were observable. The XRD signal obtained from sample B is much the 
same as that of sample A except that the intensity of the (101) In peak became stronger by 
a factor of 2 - 3. 
Fig. 3 shows the PL spectra of samples A and B measured at (a) room temperature 
and (b) 10 K. The inset displays the excitation power intensity dependence of PL spectra 
obtained at 10 K. Regardless of the variation of measurement temperature, a very strong 
emission peak at 0.7-0.8 eV (1.77-1.55 μm) was observed for both samples. However, a 
smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) of PL spectra was obtained from sample A, 
which is 121 meV at room temperature and reduces to only 68 meV at 10 K. Therefore,

undermines the quality of the film. On the other hand, Fig. 5 (b) demonstrates that the 
formation of amorphous-like SiNx thin film can be efficiently suppressed when the AlN 
buffer layer was introduced and simultaneously a wurtzite AlN layer was formed on the Si 
(111) substrate in spite of some interface inhomogeneities between them being in view. 
Further, the inset of Fig. 5 (b) displays an electron diffraction pattern taken from the 
>< 0110  direction of hexagonal AlN. Clearly, a monocrystalline InN film of wurtzite 
structure was deposited along the c-axis of AlN. This crystalline orientation has also been 
reflected in the XRD pattern presented in Fig. 2, wherein the (0002) peak dominates the 
entire spectrum. Based on the results obtained so far, the effect of InN/AlN double-buffer 
layers on the epitaxial growth of InN on Si (111) is considered as follows. The AlN first 
buffer might not only play a role of a good wetting layer, prevents the formation of 
amorphous SiNx thin film on top of the Si substrate, but also pre-determine the crystal 
structure of the top InN film. While, the following low-temperature grown InN buffer acts 
as a nucleation layer, initializing the crystal growth with small nuclides, which coalesce to 
form a continuous layer. It is quite possible for the hexagonal-type nucleation of InN 
crystallites to occur when the first buffer of AlN is introduced.  
As a first step to realize the effect of InN/AlN double-buffer layers on InN-on-Si, we 
have carried out the study as described above. Nevertheless, some material characteristics 
other than the optical properties are still left to be examined, such as the surface 
morphology of InN epilayer is still very rough (with a roughness of about 40-50 nm). 
Therefore, to achieve high-quality InN-on-Si heterostructures for device applications, 
many epitaxial parameters are left to be investigated. 
 
4. Conclusions 
InN epilayers have been successfully grown on Si (111) substrate by AP-MOCVD 
using InN/AlN double-buffer layers. XRD analysis indicates that the grown layer is a 
highly [0001] oriented wurtzite structure. Room temperature PL measurement exhibits a 
strong emission from InN epilayer at the energy of 0.72 eV with an FWHM of only 121 
meV. Furthermore, the luminescence mechanism is considered to be the band-to-band 
transition based on the excitation power dependent PL characterizations. Besides, TRPL 
analysis exhibits that the InN epilayer buffered by InN/AlN double thin layers is a 
structurally uniform film with a recombination lifetime of 0.85 ns. Finally, HRTEM and 
SAD observations show that the introduction of AlN buffer suppresses the formation of 
amorphous SiNx layer and enhances the growth of (0001)-oriented monocrystalline InN on 
Si (111).
