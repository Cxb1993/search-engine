It is important to note the peak compaction loading must be based on directly calculated 
lateral stress increase rather than directly calculated peak vertical stress increase multiplied by Ko, 
Ka or some other coefficient. Seed and Duncan (1983) concluded that either in the free field, or at 
or near vertical, non-deflecting soil/structure interfaces, Δσ’h,vc,p resulting from surface 
compaction loading can be calculated directly by simple elastic analysis. The parameter of 
Poisson’s ratio, ν for surface compaction loading may be chosen according to the empirically 
derived relationship

In the field, the factors affecting compaction include the thickness of lift, the intensity of 
pressure applied by the compacting equipment, and the area over which the pressure is applied. 
During compaction, the dry unit weight of soil is affected by the number of roller passes. 
Johnson and Sallberg (1960) used 84.5 kN (19 kip) three-wheel roller to compact a silty clay in 
229 mm (9 in) loose layers at different moisture contents. The test results show the growth curve 
that indicated the dry unit weight of a soil at a given moisture content increases to a certain point 
with the number of roller passes in Fig. 4. 
In Fig. 5, D’Appolonia et al. (1969) reported the distribution of the unit weight of soil with 
depth for a poorly graded dune sand, for which compaction was achieved by a vibratory drum 
roller. Vibration was produced by mounting an eccentric weight on a single rotating shaft within 
the drum cylinder. The weight of the roller used for this compaction was 55.6 kN (12.5 kip), and 
the drum diameter was 1.19 m (47 in). The lifts were kept at 2.44m (8 ft). The dry unit weight of 
compacted soil increased with the number of roller passes. However, the rate of increase in unit 
weight gradually decreases after about 15 passes. The dry unit weight and hence the relative 
density Dr reached maximum values at a depth of about 0.5 m (1.5 ft) and gradually decreased at 
lesser depths. This decrease occurs because of the lack of confining pressure toward the surface.

3. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 
 
To investigate the effects of vibratory compaction on the vertical and horizontal stresses in a 
cohesionless soil mass, the instrumented non-yielding model retaining wall facility at National 
Chiao Tung University (NCTU) was used. This chapter introduces the NCTU non-yielding 
retaining wall facilities and the vibratory compactor used to densify the loose backfill. The 
NCTU non-yielding retaining wall facilities consist of three components: (1) the soil bin, (2) soil 
pressure transducers, and (3) the data acquisition system (Chen and Fang, 2002). The details of 
the foregoing apparatuses are described in the following sections. 
 
3.1 Soil Bin 
 
To simulate a plan strain condition for model test, the soil bin is designed to minimize the lateral 
deflection of sidewalls. In Fig. 6, the soil bin was fabricated of steel plates with inside dimensions 
of 1500 mm × 1500 mm × 1600 mm. The soil bin was divided into two parts to discuss in the 
following section: (1) model wall, and (2) sidewall and end wall. 
The model wall shown in Fig. 6 is 1500 mm-wide and 1600 mm-high, and 45 mm-thick. To 
achieve at-rest condition, the wall material should be nearly rigid. It is hoped that the deformation 
of the wall could be neglected with the application of earth pressure. As indicated in Fig. 6, 
twenty-four 20 mm-thick steel columns were welded to the four sidewalls to reduce any lateral 
deformation during loading. In addition, twelve C-shaped steel beams were also welded 
horizontally around the box to further increase the stiffness of the box. 
Assuming a 1.5 m-thick cohesionless backfill with a unit weight γ = 17.1 kN/m3, and an 
internal friction angle φ = 41o was pluviated into the box. A 45 mm-thick solid steel plate with a 
Young’s modulus of 210 GPa was chosen as the wall material. The estimated deflection of the 
model wall would be only 1.22 × 10-3 mm. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lateral 
movement of the model wall is negligible and an at-rest condition can be achieved.  
The end-wall and sidewalls of the soil bin were made of 35 mm-thick steel plates. Outside 
the steel walls, vertical steel columns and horizontal steel beams were welded to increase the 
stiffness of the end-wall and sidewalls. If the soil bin was filled with dense sand, the estimated 
maximum deflection of the sidewall would be 1.86 × 10-3 mm. From a practical point of view, 
the deflection of the four walls around the soil bin can be neglected. 
 
3.2 Soil Pressure Transducers 
 
To investigate the distribution of stress in the backfill, a series of soil pressure transducers 
(Kyowa BE-2KCM17, capacity = 98.1 kN/m2) as shown in Fig. 7 was used. The transducers 
were buried in the soil mass to measure the variation of vertical and horizontal earth pressure 
during the filling and compaction process. The five radial extensions projected from the 
transducer are used to prevent possible rotation of the transducer due to filling and compaction. 
The effective diameter of the transducer is 22 mm and its thickness is 6 mm. 
 
3.3 Data Acquisition System 
 
A data acquisition system was used to collect and store the considerable amount of data 
generated during the tests. The data acquisition system is composed of the following four parts: 
(1) dynamic strain amplifiers (Kyowa: DPM601A and DPM711B); (2) AD/DA card (NI

5. TEST RESULTS FOR LOOSE SAND 
 
5.1 Testing Procedure 
 
The testing procedures adopted for this report for the measurement of relative density and stresses 
in the loose backfill are briefly described below. 
For the measurement of the relative density: 
(1) Sand pluviated into the soil bin by controlling the drop height of soil and slot opening of the 
sand hopper. 
(2) Density cups placed at the different elevations and locations. 
(3) After the soil had been filled up to 1.5 m from the bottom of the soil bin, soil density cups 
were dug out from the soil mass carefully. 
(4) The weight of the cup and soil was measured and recorded. 
For the measurement of the earth pressures: 
(1) Sand pluviated into the soil bin by controlling the drop height of soil and slot opening of the 
sand hopper. 
(2) Placed the SPTs at the desired locations. 
(3) When the backfill was filled up to 1.5 m, the earth pressures were recorded and stored. 
 
5.2 Distribution of Soil Density 
 
To observe the distribution of soil density in the soil bin, the soil density cups were made. The 
soil density control cup made of acrylic is illustrated in Fig. 11. During the preparation of soil 
specimen, density cups were buried in the soil mass at different elevations and different locations 
in the backfill. After the soil had been filled up to 1.5 m from the bottom of the soil bin, soil 
density cups were dug out from the soil mass carefully. The distribution of soil density with 
depth for loose sand is shown in Fig. 12. The mean relative density is Dr = 34.1 % with the 
standard deviation of 2.4%. The soil density distribution was reported by Chen (2002). The test 
results are in fairly good agreement with data. The backfill achieved with the air-pluviation 
method was loose, Dr = 15%~50% as suggested by Das (1994).  
 
For comparison purposes, at the beginning of this study, experiments were conducted to 
investigate the stresses in an uncompacted backfill. Fig. 13 shows the location of soil pressure 
transducers to measure the distribution vertical earth pressure σv with depth. The method to 
confirm the location and depth of the SPT in the soil mass is shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 15 shows the 
photograph of SPT used to measure vertical stress in the soil mass. After the backfill had been 
filled up to 1.5 m thick, the vertical earth pressure σv measured in the soil mass was illustrated in 
Fig. 16. Obviously, the vertical pressure increased with increasing depth and the test data were in 
good agreement with the equation σv = γz, where γ is the unit weight of the backfill. The 
locations of soil pressure transducers to measure the distribution of horizontal earth pressure σh 
were shown in Fig. 17. Fig. 18 shows the photograph of SPT used to measure horizontal stress in 
the soil mass. The distribution of horizontal earth pressure σh with depth was illustrated in Fig. 
19. In the figure, the earth pressure profile induced by the 1500 mm-thick loose backfill was 
approximately linear and was in good agreement with the Jaky’s equation. Mayne and Kulhawy 
(1982), Mesri and Hayat (1993) reported the Jaky’s equation is suitable for backfill in its loosest

compaction effort. Fig. 24 shows the surface settlement increased with the increasing number of 
passes of the compactor. After compactor was pulled horizontally by the operator on the 
compaction lane, the surface settlement was not uniform. 
 
By controlling the drop height of soil and slot opening of the sand hopper, a loose sand 
specimen (Dr = 34%) was prepared testing. Fig. 25 shows the contours of relative density in soil 
mass after the first passage of the compactor. In Fig. 26, Fig. 27, and Fig. 28, the region of dense 
sand (Dr = 60% ~ 80%) expanded with the increasing number of the compactor passes. The 
maximum relative density below the compactor was 68%, 72%, and 75%, respectively. The 
relative density 64%, 68%, 72% and 75% are correspond to the dry unit weight 16.3 kN/m3, 16.4 
kN/m3, 16.5 kN/m3 and 16.6 kN/m3, respectively.  
 
6.3 Change of Vertical Stresses due to Compaction 
 
In Fig. 29, it is seen that the contours of Δσv after the first passage of the compactor were 
analogous to concentric circles. The center of the concentric circles corresponding to the max 
Δσv was located at the depth of 300 mm below the compactor. The Δσv would decrease gradually 
from the central region. Before compaction, vertical stress at the depth of 300 mm calculated 
by σv = γz was 4.68 kN/m2. The incremental vertical stress Δσv was 2.2 kN/m2 and the 
incremental stress ratio was 53.0%. In Fig. 28, the relative density of soil changed from the 
initial value 34% to the maximum value of 72%. At z = 300 mm, the vertical stress increment 
due to the change of γ  (from 15.6 kN/m3 to 16.6 kN/m3) was 0.30 kN/m2. The Comparison 
between 2.2 kN/m2 and 0.30 kN/m2, indicated that the vertical stress increment Δσv was not only 
affected by change of unit weight of soil. The change of the vertical stress was related to the 
compaction-induced stresses.  
It may be concluded that the compaction-induced vertical stresses were quite significant 
below the compactor. As the number of passes increased to 2, 4, and 8, more compaction energy 
was input into the soil mass. In Fig. 30, Fig. 31, and Fig. 32, the contours showed that the depth 
of the compaction-induced zone increased with increasing energy input. The vertical stress 
increment Δσv increased with increasing number of passages of the compactor. 
 
6.4 Change of Horizontal Stresses due to Compaction 
 
In Fig. 33, the contours of Δσh formed two circles of stresses at the depth of 300 mm below the 
edge of the compactor. The Δσh gradually decreased with increasing depth and the distance from 
the compactor. At z = 300mm, the initial horizontal stress at the depth of 300 mm calculated by 
Jaky’s equation was 2.27 kN/m2. The incremental horizontal stress Δσh was up to 1.40 kN/m2 
and the stress incremental ratio was 62 %. It may be concluded that the compaction-induced 
horizontal stresses were quite obvious below the compactor. When the number of passes of the 
compactor increased to 2 passes, the two circles of high stresses remained below the edge of the 
compactor as shown in Fig. 34. After 2 – passes of the compactor, Δσh increased to 1.6 kN/m2. 
However, as the number of passes of the compactor increased to 4 and 8 passes, the double high 
stress circles disappeared, and the contours of Δσh were analogous to concentric circles in Fig. 
35 and Fig. 36. It is clear that the depth of the compaction-induced zone increased with 
increasing compaction energy input.

Y.S. Fang and Y.L. Chien / Variation of Soil Density and Earth Pressure due to Strip Compaction 701
To simulate the compaction of loose soil in the field, a 
vibratory compactor was made by attaching an eccentric motor 
(Mikasa Sangyo, KJ75-2P) to a 0.225 m × 0.225 m steel plate. 
The total mass of the vibratory compactor was 12.1 kg. The 
amplitude of downward cyclic vertical force (static + dynamic) 
measured with a load cell placed under the base plate of the 
vibratory compactor was 1.767 kN. The measured frequency of 
vibration was 44 Hz. Assuming the distribution of contact 
pressure between the base plate and soil was uniform, the 
downward cyclic normal stress σcyc applied to the surface of the 
soil was 34.9 kN/m2.

Air-dry Ottawa sand was used as fill material. To simulate 
the effects of compaction on the surface of a loose fill, the 
vibratory compactor was pulled over the compaction lane from 
the left sidewall to the right sidewall as shown in Figure 2. Then 
the compactor was turned around 180 degrees to compact the 
same lane for the second pass. At the end, the fill below the 
compaction lane had been compacted for eight passes with the 
compactor. The compaction lane was 0.225 m-wide, 1.5 m-long 
and each pass took 70 seconds.

3 TEST RESULTS 
This section reports the variation of the surface settlement, 
relative density, vertical stress and the horizontal stress due to 
the strip compaction on the surface of the fill. 
Figure 3 shows the surface settlement increased with the 
increasing number of passes N of the compactor. The surface 
settlement S shown in Figure 4 was the average settlement of 
the seven points (point B to H) shown in Figure 3. In Figure 4, 
the data points obtained from tests 0701 and 0703 indicated that 
the test results were quite reproducible. Based on the test 
results, a hyperbolic model was proposed to estimate the surface 
settlement S as a function of the number of passes of the 
compactor. The hyperbolic relationship can be expressed as: 
  
                                                                                               
(1) 
 
where S is the surface settlement in mm, and N is number of 
passes of the compactor.

Figure 4. Hyperbolic model to estimate surface settlements S as a 
function of number of passes of compactor N. 
 
Figure 5 shows the contours of relative density in soil mass 
after the first passage of the compactor. Before compaction, the 
fill has a uniform relative density of 34%. Under the 
compaction lane, the soil density became quite dense (Dr = 
64%), and the soil density decreased gradually with the distance 
from the compaction lane. From the relative density of 34% to 
64%, the effects of vibratory compaction on soil density were 
quite obvious right below the compactor. As the number of 
passes increased to 8, more compaction energy was transmitted 
to the soil. In Figure 6, the region of dense sand (Dr = 72%) 
expanded with the increasing number of the compactor passes. 
The maximum relative density below the compactor was 75%. 
The relative density 64% and 75% is corresponding to the dry 
unit weight 16.3 kN/m3 and 16.6 kN/m3, respectively.

4 MECHANISM OF SOILS UNDER STRIP COMPACTION 
Based on the test results reported in previous sections, the 
mechanism of soils under strip compaction is discussed in this 
section. 
Based on the contours of Δσh in the soil mass after the first 
passage of the compactor shown in Figure 9, Figure 11 shows 
the comparison between contours of Δσh in this study and soils 
under the bearing capacity failure mode (Vesic, 1973). The 
horizontal stresses under the compactor did not increase which 
was analogous to the elastic zone under the footing. In Vesic’s 
model, soils in the radial shear zones were pushed by the 
downward penetration of the footing. In Figure 11, the two high 
stress zones were thus induced. The mechanism of soils after 
the first pass of the compactor could be properly explained by 
local-shear bearing capacity failure mode. 
Based on the study of Yang (2006) shown in Figure 12, the 
influenced range below the pile tip in clean sand would            
be 3.5D ~ 5.5D, where D is pile diameter. Calculating the 
influenced zone of compaction by substituting the compactor 
width B = 225 mm for D, the influence range would be 788 mm 
~ 1238 mm. In figure 8 and figure 10, the depth of influence 
zone for Δσv and Δσh was 800 mm ~ 1200 mm, respectively. 
Figure 12 shows both the contours of Δσh measured after 8 
passes of the compactor and the influenced zone for a single 
pile driven in cohesionless soil (Yang, 2006). The influenced 
zone of compaction is analogous to the stresses below the tip of 
the pile in cohesionless soil. The mechanism of soils after 8 
passes of the compactor could be simulated by a single pile 
driven in a cohesionless soil.

5 CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, the effects of strip compaction on sand are 
investigated. Based on the test results, the following 
conclusions can be drawn. 
1. The surface settlement increased with the increasing number 
of passes of the compactor. The relationship between the 
surface settlement and the number of passes of the compactor 
could be properly described by the hyperbolic model. 
2. The contours of Δσv after the first passage of the compactor 
were analogous to a series of concentric circles. As the number 
  
of passes increased to 8, more compaction energy was input to 
the soil mass and the depth of the compaction-induced zone 
increased with increasing energy input.

pile driven into sand. (redrawn after Yang, 2006) 
 
 
 
3. After the first pass of the compactor, the contours of Δσh 
formed two regions of stress concentration at the depth of 300 
mm below the surface. As the number of passage of the 
compactor increased to 8, the two high-stress regions merged. 
4. The mechanism of soils after the first passage of the 
compactor could be properly explained by local-shear bearing 
capacity failure mode. The mechanism of soils after 8 passes of 
the compactor could be simulated by a single pile driven into a 
cohesionless soil.

ABSTRACT 
This paper studies the variation of soil density and earth pressure in a soil mass due to the vibratory compaction along a strip on the
surface of the cohesionless backfill. Experiments were conducted in a non-yielding model retaining wall facility and dry Ottawa sand 
was used as fill material. Based on the test results, it is found that surface settlement increased with the increasing number of passage
of the compactor. The relationship between the surface settlement and the number of passes could be properly described by the 
hyperbolic model.  The contours of Δσv after the first passage of the compactor were analogous to a series of concentric circles. As the 
number of passes increased to 8, the depth of the compaction-induced zone increased with increasing energy input. After the first 
passage of the compactor, the contours of Δσh formed two regions of stress concentration below the surface. As the number of 
passage increased to 8, the two high-stress regions merged. The mechanism of soils after the first passage of the compactor could be 
properly explained by local-shear bearing capacity failure mode. The mechanism of soils after 8 passes of the compactor could be 
simulated by a single pile driven into a cohesionless soil. 
 
RÉSUMÉ 
Cet article étudie les variations de la densité et de la poussée du sol après le compactage par vibration d’une bande à la surface d’un 
remblai meuble. Des expériences furent réalisées pour étudier les effets d’un vibro-compacteur sur la densification du sol. Basé sur les 
résultats des essais, la relation entre le tassement de la surface et le nombre de passages du vibro-compacteur pouvait être représentée 
de manière appropriée par un modèle hyperbolique. Après le compactage, les contours de l’incrément de contrainte verticale Δσv
étaient semblables à des cercles concentriques après le premier passage du vibro-compacteur et après 8 passages, et le Δσv  diminuait 
graduellement à partir de la zone centrale de compactage. Les contours de l’incrément de contrainte horizontale Δσh formaient deux 
zones circulaires de contraintes élevées et Δσh diminuait graduellement à partir de la zone centrale après le premier compactage. Les 
contours de Δσh étaient semblables à des cercles concentriques après 8 passages du vibro-compacteur. La profondeur de la zone de 
compaction induite augmentait avec l’accroissement de l’énergie de compactage. Basé sur les résultats des essais, la mécanique des 
sols du remblai après le premier passage du vibro-compacteur pouvait être simulée à l’aide d’un test de résistance au cisaillement 
d’une semelle peu profonde. Cependant, après 8 passages du vibro-compacteur, l’interaction entre le compacteur et le sol pouvait 
alors être simulée par la pénétration d’un pieu carré dans un sol meuble.

1 INTRODUCTION  
In the construction of highway embankments and earth dams, 
engineers would compact the loose fill to increase its unit 
weights. The objective of the compaction operation is to 
improve the engineering properties of soil such as to increase 
the bearing capacity or to reduce settlement. Compaction is a 
particular kind of soil stabilization method and it is one of the 
oldest methods for improving existing soil or man-placed fills.  
To analyze the residual lateral earth pressure induced by soil 
compaction, several methods of analysis have been proposed by 
Ingold (1979), Duncan and Seed (1986), Peck and Mesri (1987) 
and other researchers. However, little information regarding the 
mechanism of the compacted soil has been reported.  
This study simulates the two-dimensional line-compaction 
with a vibratory compactor on the surface of a loose granular 
soil in the field. Tests results obtained included the surface 
settlement, the change of soil density, and the change of stresses 
in the soil mass due to compaction. Based on the test data, the 
mechanism of the compacted soil due to the strip compaction on 
the surface of a sandy soil mass is explored.  
 
 
 
2 EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 
To investigate the effects of vibratory compaction on a 
cohesionless soil mass, the instrumented non-yielding model 
retaining wall facility (Chen and Fang, 2002) at National Chiao 
Tung University (NCTU) was used.  
To constitute a plane strain condition for model testing, the 
soil bin was designed to minimize the lateral deflection of 
sidewalls and the friction between the backfill and sidewalls. 
The soil bin was fabricated of steel plates with inside 
dimensions of 1500 mm x 1500 mm x 1600 mm as shown in 
Figure 1. To minimize the friction between the backfill and 
sidewalls, a lubrication layer consisted of plastic sheets was 
furnished for all model wall experiments. The lubrication layer 
proposed by Fang et al. (2004) consisted of one thick and two 
thin plastic sheets hung vertically on each sidewall of the soil 
bin before the backfill was deposited.   
To investigate the distribution of stresses in the backfill, a 
series of soil pressure transducers (Kyowa BE-2KCM17, 
capacity = 98.1 kN/m2) were used. The transducers were buried 
in the soil mass to measure the variation of vertical and 
horizontal earth pressure during the filling and compaction 
process. 
Y.S. Fang and Y.L. Chien / Variation of Soil Density and Earth Pressure due to Strip Compaction 702 
center of the concentric circles corresponding to the maximum 
Δσv was located at the depth of 300 mm below the surface. The 
Δσv would decrease gradually from the central high-stress 
region. 
 
Figure 5. Contours of relative density after 1 – pass of compactor. 
 
 
Figure 6. Contours of relative density after 8 – passes of compactor. 
 
 
Before compaction, vertical stress at the depth of 300 mm 
calculated by σv = γz was 4.68 kN/m2. The incremental vertical 
stress Δσv was 2.2 kN/m2 and the incremental stress ratio was 
53.0%. 
In Figure 6, the relative density of soil changed from the 
initial value 34% to the maximum value of 72%. At z = 300 
mm, the vertical stress increment due to the change of γ  (from 
15.6 kN/m3 to 16.6 kN/m3) was 0.30 kN/m2. The Comparison 
between 2.2 kN/m2 and 0.30 kN/m2, indicated that the vertical 
stress increment Δσv was not only affected by the change of soil 
unit weight. The change of vertical stress was related to the 
compaction-induced stresses. 
It may be concluded that the compaction-induced vertical 
stresses were quite significant below the compaction lane. As 
the number of passes increased to 8, more compaction energy 
was input into the soil mass. In Figure 8, the contours showed 
that the depth of the compaction-induced zone increased with 
increasing energy input. The vertical stress increment Δσv 
increased with increasing number of passage of the compactor. 
In Figure 9, the contours of Δσh formed two regions of stress 
concentration at the depth of 300 mm below the surface. Below 
the peak-stress points, Δσh gradually decreased with increasing 
depth. At z = 300mm, the initial horizontal stress calculated by 
Jaky’s equation was 2.27 kN/m2. The incremental horizontal 
stress Δσh was up to 1.40 kN/m2 and the stress incremental ratio 
was 62 %. It may be concluded that the compaction-induced 
horizontal stresses were quite obvious below the compaction lane. 
However, as the number of passes of the compactor increased 
to 8, the double high-stress regions merged, and the contours of 
Δσh were analogous to a series of concentric circles as shown in 
Figure 10. It is clear in figures 9 and 10 that the depth of the 
compaction-influenced zone increased with increasing 
compaction energy input.
