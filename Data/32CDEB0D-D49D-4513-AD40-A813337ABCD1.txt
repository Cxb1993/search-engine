cooler. Finally, she suggested that the methods to improve the performance of 
thermoelectric cooler were not only using a larger figure-of-merit but also considering the 
influence of Thomson effect. 
In 2009, Osamu Yamashita [8] investigated a new parameter, the resultant Seebeck 
coefficient, which is derived from the temperature dependence of the intrinsic Seebeck 
coefficient by considering the Thomson effect. Both the resultant Seebeck coefficient and 
the resultant figure-of-merit were larger than the intrinsic properties for a thermoelectric 
element. 
In this research, in order to increase the cooling capacity of thermoelectric cooler, we 
use two-stage thermoelectric coolers as our test module. Additionally, two-stage 
thermoelectric test module is examined for different types (serial type, parallel type and 
separate type with different current ratios). 
In previous investigations of thermoelectric cooler, constant hot and cold side 
temperatures of thermoelectric module were often chosen as boundary conditions. 
However, like Hodes [9], we used the fixed hot side temperature and the fixed cold side 
heat load as boundary conditions to analyze single stage thermoelectric cooler. The cold 
side heat load is controlled in order to meet the known allowable power input for the 
electronic components in practical application. The hot side temperature of thermoelectric 
module remains fixed to easily observe the cold side temperature variation.  
On the other hand, not only Joule heat but also Thomson heat is taken into account in 
the internal thermal analysis of thermoelectric cooler. In order to discuss the effect of 
Thomson heat on temperature prediction and the interior heat transfer mechanism of 
two-stage thermoelectric coolers, three different Seebeck coefficient models (Constant 
Seebeck Model, Quadratic Polynomial Seebeck Model and Log-linear Seebeck Model) 
are examined through experimental investigation and simulation. 
 
2 Analytical method 
 
2.1 General Model 
 
Before the experiment of two-stage thermoelectric coolers, the conversion relation 
between thermal energy and electrical energy will be introduced. In this research, for 
nonequilibrium thermodynamic system, temperature distribution of thermoelectric cooler 
is analyzed in the microcosm. We take a pair of semiconductors in thermoelectric cooler 
as the micro-system for analysis. Governing equations of two-stage thermoelectric coolers 
are derived according to irreversible thermodynamics, thermoelectric relations and 
Onsager’s Reciprocal Relations.  
The three dimensional governing equation of thermoelectric effects is derived in this 
4 
 
temperature distributions are ( )1 1T x  and ( )2 2T x  respectively. In addition, we define the 
temperature ( )i iT x  at ix l=  as the hot side temperature hiT  and at 0ix =  as the cold 
side temperature ciT ; the hot side heat load and the cold side heat load are hiQ  and ciQ  
( 1, 2i = ). 
Two-stage thermoelectric coolers are divided into serial type, parallel type, and 
separate type with varied current ratio γ , which is defined as 
 
1 2I Iγ = , (2) 
where 1I  is equal to the current of TEC 1 and 2I  is equal to the current of TEC 2. 
Here we choose 1
2
γ =  or 2 for separate type to realize the effect of current ratio on 
two-stage thermoelectric coolers. In this research, the current supplied to the test module 
is defined as totI . 
In this research, the test condition is to control the cold side heat load CQ  and the hot 
side temperature HT  of the test module. The hot side heat load HQ  and the cold side 
temperature CT  of the test module are unknown parameters. There are two reasons for 
the chosen conditions since this test module is used to cool electronic components. The 
first reason is that the power of most electron components is fixed, so controlling the cold 
side heat load is similar to practical application. The other reason for fix hot side 
temperature is to control the temperature of environment where electronic components are 
assembled. Also, we define the direction of the whole test module as x and the total length 
are 2l. Furthermore, for two-stage thermoelectric coolers, we assume that the temperatures 
and heat transfers at the junction have the same values for TEC 1 and TEC 2. Without the 
influence of interface layers, the boundary conditions is listed below,

many factors, a few reasonable assumptions are listed below. 
1. The test module operates in steady state, and all properties are independent of time.

2. Electric current flows along single direction without scattering. 
3. Energy only transmits across the cold side and the hot side of the test module. The 
other parts are assumed to be in adiabatic condition, i.e, no energy transfer. 
4. Heat only flows along the x-direction. 
5. Heat load supplied by heating unit is completely absorbed by the test module. 
6. The contact resistances between the interfaces of the test module are neglected. 
7. Thermal conductivity ( k ) and electrical resistivity ( ρ ) are viewed as constants at any 
temperature, and their values are obtained from the average value of thermal 
conductivity and electrical resistivity of p-type and n-type. 
8. Seebeck coefficient at different temperatures is measured in experiment. The data of 
Seebeck coefficient will be applied to determine CSM model, PSM model and LLS 
model.  
9. The effect of interface layers on the performance of thermoelectric cooler is neglected. 
10. The properties of p-type are equal to the properties of n-type. Only the electric 
current and the Seebeck coefficient are negative in n-type.  
 
 
2.3 Experimental Method 
 
The experimental structure is divided into four parts, power supply, data acquisition 
system, forced convection section and test section. The power supply provides the voltage 
and current required by the forced convection section and test section. The test section is 
placed in the forced convection section. When the test section is operating under the set 
8 
 
area. 
In this research, we use the 40 mm2 silicon rubber heater as the heating element. The 
electrical resistance of the heater is fixed. Thus we can control the heat load by the input 
current.  Furthermore, the heater thickness is considerably thin, so the heater can provide 
the heat load normal to the test module. The heater can also adhere to the test module 
tightly due to the soft structure. In addition, a complementary heater is assembled to make 
sure that the heat will not dissipate from the bottom. 
The test module is composed of two-stage thermoelectric coolers and two heat 
spreaders. The thermoelectric cooler is constructed from 125 pairs of semiconductors and 
two interface layers. The interface layer (ceramic substrate) is thermally conductive but 
electrically insulated. The heat spreader is made of brass. The heat spreader can spread the 
heat uniformly, and three grooves are processed on the spreader to set the thermocouples 
without destroying the surface of thermoelectric coolers. 
For two-stage thermoelectric coolers experiment, the control conditions are the fixed 
hot side temperature of test module ( HT ) and controlling the cold side heat loads or the 
heat loads of heating element ( CQ ). The hot side temperature is kept at 323.2K, 333.2K or 
343.2K respectively. The heat load is controlled with 5.5W, 12.3W or 22.0W. Then we 
control the total current of test module ( totI ) on 1.0A, 1.5A, 2.0A, 2.5A and 3.0A to 
change the cooling capacity. 
The cold side heat load is controlled by the heating element whose current is supplied by 
the power supply. The hot side temperature is controlled by the forced convection section. 
During the main experiment, we monitor whether the hot side temperature is in steady 
state or not. The criteria is defined as the temperature change in ±0.3K during 600 sec. 
Eventually, the cold side temperature ( CT ) and the voltage of test module ( TECV ) are 
measured, and the temperature difference ( TΔ ) and COP are calculated. 
10 
 
these two models is high. In detail, the coefficient of determination of PSM model is 
larger than the coefficient of determination of LLS model, i.e. the PSM model is colser to 
the actual Seebeck coefficient than the LLS model. 
 
3.2 Experimental Results 
 
When supplying a high current with a high cold side heat load, the hot side temperature 
cannot keep in the set temperature due to the insufficiency of the surroundings control 
system. Hence there is no data under some conditions. Besides, if 0TΔ < , it means that 
the test module has lost its cooling capacity. Therefore, the COP has no meaning, so the 
data will not be shown.  
Since the trends of TΔ  and COP are similar at different cold side heat loads or hot 
side temperatures.  
 
 
 
Fig. 4 The variations of temperature difference ( TΔ ) and COP for serial type 
(TH = 343.2K, QC = 5.5W.) 
 
we select serial type with QC=5.5W at TH=343.2K as a representation to analyze the 
trend of TΔ  and COP with increasing the total current of test module ( totI ). As shown in 
Fig 4, temperature difference increases with the increasing current. Because the cooling 
capacity of test module enhances as the current increases, the test module can generate a 
larger temperature difference. The other characteristic is that the increasing amount of 
temperature difference decreases with the increasing current, i.e. the slope of temperature 
difference decreases. Hence we can predict that if the current keeps increasing, the slope 
will approximate to zero at a specific current and also there will exist a maximum 
12 
 
Fig 5(a) shows the influence of hot side temperature on temperature difference. When the 
hot side temperature increases, temperature difference becomes larger. This indicates that 
thermoelectric test module has better cooling capacity at a higher hot side temperature. 
However, the change of hot side temperature doesn’t have a great effect on temperature 
difference since the increase of temperature difference is less than 3Kwhile increasing 
10K of hot side temperature. In addition, the influence of hot side temperature on 
temperature difference becomes more apparent when the current of test module increases. 
The other significant phenomenon is that the temperature difference of separate type 
with 1 2γ =  is larger than the temperature difference of separate type with 2γ = . As 
shown in Fig 6, this is caused by the thermoelectric cooler near hot side (TEC 2) not only 
has to cool the conduction heat but also has to dissipate the heat generated by the first 
thermoelectric cooler (TEC 1). Thus TEC 2 needs a higher current than TEC 1 for a larger 
cooling capacity. Otherwise, the heat will accumulate in the test module. 
 
 
Fig. 6 Illustration of separate type. 
 
The Fig 5(b) shows the effect of hot side temperature on COP of test module. COP 
decreases with the increasing hot side temperature, but the influence is quite small. The 
different current ratios for separate type only have a small effect on COP. The COP for
1 2γ =  is slightly larger than the COP for 2γ = . 
14 
 
the last one is LLS model. 
 
 
 
Fig. 8 Comparison of experiment and simulation for CSM model, PSM model and  
LLS model. 
 
Therefore, we determine that the PSM model is the best Seebeck coefficient model in 
this research. In PSM model, not only the Seebeck coefficient but also theThomson 
coefficient is dependent on temperature. Although the Thomson effect is also taken into 
account in LLS model, but the results show poor agreement. The possible reason is that 
the Thomson coefficient considered as a constant value in LLS model may result in over 
predicting. 
The existence of maximum temperature difference (ΔTmax) is predicted at a much 
higher current of test module from the experimental data. Therefore, we extended the 
range of current in simulation in order to examine the prediction. The temperature 
differences for different types are simulated at the hot side temperature 343.2K and with 
the cold side heat load 5.5W. The results are shown in Fig 9(a), and the shaded area is the 
experimental test area. From the figure, we can find that there does exist a maximum 
temperature difference at a specific current for each type. The specific current is defined 
as the optimum current, Iopt. If the current continuously increase after the optimum 
temperature, the increasing velocity of heat generation is faster than  
the Peltier cooling heat, so the temperature difference starts to decrease. At a much higher 
current, the heat generation totally eliminates the cooling effect results in the negative 
temperature difference, i.e., the test module loses cooling capacity. Here we find that the 
separate type with current ratio 1:2 has the highest maximum temperature difference. All 
the following results are analyzed for this type. 
Since COP represents the cooling efficiency, the coefficient of performance (COP) is 
meaningful only when the temperature difference is larger than zero. We find that COP 
has maximum values as temperature differences approximating to zero for each type of 
16 
 
current is defined as reverse current, Irev, more specifically, while the positive temperature 
gradient at the hot side starts to turn into negative. This phenomenon happens when heat 
gener ation increases faster than the cooling. In other words, the heat accumulates inside 
and can’t dissipate from the hot side. Input current should be lower than Irev to prevent 
from high internal temperature for practical use. 
As defined earilier, the optimum current, Iopt, will cause the maximum temperature 
difference, i.e. the cold side temperature is the lowest. In this case, Iopt =10.90A occurs 
after Irev =9.41A. We should not let the current of test module over the Irev in order to 
achieve the maximum temperature. Instead, the operating current should be less than the 
Irev to avoid the unmeasurable high temperature inside which may results in the failure of 
test module. 
 
 
Fig. 10 Temperature distribution. 
 
The distribution of Thomson heat is discussed in Fig 11. As the Thomson heat is 
positive, it means that the Thomson heat plays the cooling heat role in the interior. At the

4 Conclusion 
 
The conclusions of the investigation results are summarized below. 
1. In order to achieve good COP and good temperature difference as well, the separate 
type ( 1 2γ = ) is a better choice. 
2. We determine that the PSM model is the best Seebeck coefficient model. In PSM model, 
not only the Seebeck coefficient but also the Thomson coefficient is dependent on 
temperature. 
3. There exists a maximum temperature difference at the optimum current for each type. 
The separate type with current ratio 1:2 has the highest maximum temperature 
difference. 
4. An internal temperature larger than the hot side temperature occurs at the reverse 
current, Irev. Input current should be lower than Irev to prevent from high internal 
temperature for practical use. 
5. If the Thomson heat can be kept in positive, the cooling capacity of the two-stage 
thermoelectric coolers can improve a lot. 
We can try to substitute the air-cooling system with the water-cooling system as 
surroundings control system to resolve the insufficiency of data. To reduce the error 
between experiment and simulation, the influence of contact resistance and the 
temperature dependence of properties can be considered further. 
On the other hand, except using multistage coolers, we can increase the performance of 
thermoelectric cooler toward the following methods: (1)changing the current ratio in 1γ <
for separate type; (2)decreasing the length of thermoelectric cooler to enhance the cooling 
capacity, such as micro-thermoelectric cooler [10]; (3)manufacturing the semiconductors 
in integrated system to diminish the assembling space [11]; (4)changing the temperature 
dependence of Seebeck coefficient by Fermi energy to increase the cooling Thomson heat 
[7].

Abstract 
 Experiments were first conducted to measure the 
spectral normal emissivity values of a variety of aluminum 
alloys at 600, 700, and 800 K. Multispectral radiation 
thermometry (MRT) using linear emissivity models (LEM) 
and log-linear emissivity models (LLE) were then applied 
to predict surface temperature. Results show that the 
spectral emissivity decreases with increasing wavelength 
and increases with increasing temperature. Alloy effect 
becomes evident at higher temperature. The surface 
oxidation becomes fully-developed after the first hour 
heating and results in constant emissivity. Half of 
temperature predictions by MRT emissivity models provide 
the absolute temperature error under 10% and a quarter if 
the results are under 5%. The better emissivity model to 
suitably represent the real surface emissivity behaviors the 
more accurate inferred temperature by MRT can be 
achieved. Increasing the order of emissivity model and 
increasing the number of wavelengths cannot improve 
temperature measurement accuracy. More accurate 
temperature measurement by MRT can be achieved at 
higher temperature. Overall, three emissivity models give 
good results most frequently and provide the best 
compensation for different alloys, the number of 
wavelengths, and temperatures.

1 Introduction 
 
 Many processes in aluminum manufacturing, such as 
extruding and rolling, are required to accurately measuring 
the temperature of the aluminum alloy surface in order to 
attain desired mechanical properties, ensure product quality 
and reproducibility, as well as reduce cost. The 
thermocouple or other types of contact thermometers are 
very commonly used to measure the surface temperature in 
industry. However, in some processes, methods of contact 
temperature measurement are undesirable because the 
physical contact may not be feasible in moving material 
situations and may change the surface physically or 
chemically. Therefore, the accurate, noncontact radiation 
thermometry is highly desired for aluminum production. 
 Radiation thermometry, a convenient, non-contact 
temperature measurement method, utilizes the intensity of 
thermal radiation measured from the target surface to infer 
the true temperature. The foundation of this concept states 
that using fundamental electromagnetic wave theory, the  
measured intensity is used to infer the temperature of the  
surface when referenced to an ideal surface called a 
blackbody. The spectral intensity emitted by a blackbody at 
temperature T can be obtained by the Planck distribution

where, c1 = 1.19 × 108 W⋅μm4⋅m-2⋅sr-1 and c2 =1.439 × 104 
μm⋅K. Since the blackbody is an ideal emitter, the intensity 
of radiation emitted from a real surface will be smaller than 
from a blackbody at the same temperature. Emissivity, a 
surface radiative property is defined as the ratio of intensity 
of radiation emitted by a surface to that emitted by a 
blackbody at the same temperature. Therefore, spectral 
emissivity can be expressed as

helpful to develop an emissivity compensation algorithm 
which can accurately infer the temperature. In this study, 
the interdependent parametric influences of wavelength, 
temperature, heating time, and alloy composition on 
aluminum alloys emissivity were first investigated 
experimentally. The most commonly used MRT emissivity 
compensation algorithms, LLE and LEM, were then used to  
examine the MRT on aluminum surface temperature 
determination. 
 
3 Experimental Methods 
 
 An experimental apparatus was configured and

 The sample heating assembly consisted of cartridge

fastened by the aluminum frame and situated on a 
two-dimensional translation stage. The aluminum test 
sample was held in contact with a heating block. In order to 
minimize the temperature gradient, the heating block was 
fabricated from copper and surrounded by a thick blanket of 
high-temperature ceramic fiber insulation. Three embedded

Fig. 4 shows the emissivity distributions for AL1100, 
AL2024, AL5083, AL6061, and AL7005 at 600, 700 and 
800 K. The atmospheric absorption and scattering bands are 
centered around 2.7 μm and 4.3 μm. The former one is due  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to radiation caused by the room humidity and carbon 
dioxide, and the latter one is due to the room carbon dioxide 
alone respectively. According to Eqs. (3) and (4), the two 
bands should be excluded from the examined wavelength 
ranges since they will affect the intensity measurement and 
cause errors in calculating the spectral emissivity. Therefore, 
only the results from wavelength range 2.91 to 4.13 μm are 
shown in the figure. Overall, all alloys exhibit the expected 
trend for most metallic surfaces of monotonously 
decreasing emissivity with increasing wavelength. The 
shape of the emissivity spectrum for different alloys keeps 
linear at different temperatures. The difference of the 
emissivity value among different alloys becomes larger 
with increasing temperature. However, the spectral 
emissivity values do not always increase as expected trend 
for most metallic surfaces when the temperature increases. 
The increase in emissivity results from the surface 
oxidation and the discoloration during the heating. The 
discoloration which happens to magnesium-containing 
alloys while heating turns the surface color from light gray 
into black and results in the increase in emissivity [17]. 
AL5083 containing the most magnesium was found to have 
the highest emissivity value at 800 K. 
 Fig. 4 also shows the effect of alloy composition on 
the spectral emissivity at different temperature. The spectral 
emissivity distributions for different alloys are similar in 
shape, but not in magnitude. With increasing temperature, 
the effects of alloy composition become manifest. 
Therefore, a stronger alloy effect is evident at higher 
temperature. The differences in emissivity results from the 
variations in oxidation, which is alloy dependent.  
 Fig. 5 shows the effect of heating time on spectral 
emissivity. The results show that at 600 and 700 K, there is 
only a bit increase in emissivity after heating for periods of 
4 hours, but the increase is more evident at 800 K. The 
surface oxidation is known to contribute to the increase of 
the emissivity value with the time-at-temperature heating 
and the degree of the oxide formation is also 
alloy-dependent. Therefore, the oxidation becomes 
fully-developed after the initial first hour heating at 600 and 
700 K. However, the oxide layer continues to grow at 800 
K and leads to the increase in emissivity with increasing 
heating time. 
 
5 Application of MRT Emissivity Models 
 
 Table 5 illustrates the percentage of inferred 
temperature error predicted by two most commonly used 
MRT emissivity models, log-linear emissivity model (LLE) 
and linear emissivity model (LEM), in the spectral range 
from 2 to 4.8 μm. The atmospheric absorption and 
scattering bands centered around 2.7 μm and 4.3 μm are 
excluded from the examined wavelength range. Values 
exceeding 10% have been purposely deleted to help point 
out accurate models and their predictive trends. The results 
are shown for five different aluminum alloys: AL1100,

come in second. Similar result was also found earlier in 
Table 5. This shows that the first-order and second-order 
LLE models and the first-order LEM models not only 
achieve good temperature predictions for different alloys, 
number of wavelengths, and temperatures, but also provide 
the smallest inferred temperature errors. 
 How an emissivity model to influence the accuracy of 
temperature prediction is demonstrated through the 
following example. As shown in Table 5, for AL5083 at 
800 K with number of wavelengths n, the first-order LLE  
and the first-order LEM emissivity models show very good 
temperature prediction. Figs. 6(a) and (b) show that the 
emissivity distribution inferred by the first-order LLE and 
the first-order LEM emissivity models are in very good 
agreement with the real emissivity distribution. Therefore, 
if the generated emissivity spectrum inferred by the 
emissivity model can well represent the real emissivity 
behaviors, the more accurate inferred temperature can be 
achieved. 
 Table 7 shows the effects of emissivity values on 
MRT temperature prediction. The percentages of inferred 
temperature error predicted by MRT are given for the 
first-order and second-order LLE models and the first-order 
LEM models using the required minimum number of 
wavelengths in the spectral range from 2 to 4.8 μm. To help 
point out any useful trends, only values below 10% are 
shown in the table. The spectral emissivity values for all 
test alloys are generally divided into three regions: smaller 
than 0.13, in between 0.13 and 0.16, and higher than 0.16. 
From the results, apparently the better performance is found 
in the large emissivity value region. When the emissivity 
value is below 0.13, the good results are found less and 
randomly. Therefore, higher emissivity value shows better 
MRT temperature prediction. As we know, for most 
metallic surface, the emissivity typically increases with 
increasing temperature. This leads to the inference that for 
aluminum alloys surface more accurate temperature  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measurement by MRT can be achieved at higher 
temperature. 
 
6 Conclusions  
 
 In this study, experiments were performed to measure 
the normal spectral emissivity values for five different 
aluminum alloys, AL1100, AL2024, AL5083, AL6061, and 
AL7005 at 600 K, 700 K and 800 K. The effects of 
different parameters on spectral emissivity, such as 
wavelength, temperature, alloy composition, and heating 
time are investigated. Then the experimental work is 
complemented by two commonly used MRT emissivity 
models, LLE and LEM, to predict the surface temperature. 
The application of the MRT emissivity models on 
aluminum alloys are examined and analyzed. Key findings 
from this study are discussed below. 
 For aluminum alloys emissivity behaviors, all alloys 
overall exhibit the expected trend for most metallic surfaces 
of monotonously decreasing emissivity with increasing 
wavelength. However, the spectral emissivity value does 
not always increase as expected when the temperature
