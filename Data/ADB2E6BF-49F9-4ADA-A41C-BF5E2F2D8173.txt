performance of the CB-DBA mechanism is compared with 
the GB-DBA in terms of the throughput, end-to-end 
delay, drop probability, jitter and fairness for 16 
and 32 ONUs. The simulation results show that the BI-
DBA mechanism can improve the bandwidth utilization, 
Quality of Service (QoS) and realize the fairness for 
both different ONUs and services. The GB-DBA 
mechanism has better system performances in average 
bandwidth utilization, packet latency and drop 
probability； on the other hand, the CB-DBA has 
better end-to-end delay performance when the 
proportion of constant bit rate traffic is higher and 
has better fairness performance when the number of 
ONU is 32.

(NG-PON) owing to the increased upstream rates and 
distances between OLT and ONUs.  
The EPON and GPON standards do not explicitly specify 
any DBA algorithm to be used for the upstream time slot 
allocation. Only a framework is defined for the whole DBA 
process, and its implementation is left for the designers. In 
the past decade, numerous scholars have proposed a variety 
of DBA algorithms in EPON [4-7] and GPON [8-12]. In the 
bandwidth allocation, the estimated-based DBA can resolve 
the queue state inconsistency problem by according to the 
information of queue status and the waiting time of new 
arrival packets to execute the Differserv prediction. 
Therefore, the estimated-based DBA is the best among the 
fixed, limited and SLA-based DBA. In the uplink scheduling, 
the two-stage-based DBA, which can resolve the idle period 
problem, is better than the sequence and re-order scheduling. 
The two-stage-based DBA can perform clustering by class of 
service (which is able to enhance the specific services but 
cannot guarantee the overall system performance) or perform 
clustering by a number of subscribers (which is able to 
provide a comprehensive system performance). However, 
aforementioned dynamic bandwidth allocations and 
scheduling schemes have not been discussed and explored in 
the GPON literature.  
In this report, the proposed Bi-group Dynamic 
Bandwidth Allocation (BI-DBA) mechanisms which include 
Class-based scheduling (CB-DBA) and Group-based 
scheduling (GB-DBA) is studied in GPON environments. In 
the simulation environments, the ONU grouping methods, 
transmission sequence in different proportions of the traffic 
type, and a different number of ONUs are adopted to 
investigate the system performance in terms of packet delay, 
QoS, drop probability and fairness. The rest of this paper is 
organized as follows. Section II presents the proposed BI-
DBA mechanism in GPON. The simulation results of BI-
DBA mechanism are evaluated and compared in Section III, 
and followed by conclusions in Section IV.  
II. BI-GROUP DYNAMIC BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION (BI-
DBA) MECHANISM 
2.1 Hybrid cycle scheduling in BI-DBA 
The proposed method, shown in Fig. 2, is motivated by 
the previous work [7,12] to support different services in 
GPON, and the different classes of service require 
differential performance bounds. The transmission cycle 
time is divided by two bi-partition groups. The BI-DBA 
scheduling algorithm divides one transmission cycle time 
into two groups and dynamically adjusts the bandwidth 
between the first group and the second group alternatively to 
resolve the traditional idle period problem. In Class-based 
scheduling (CB-DBA), the first groups are with high-priority 
traffics, T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 2 for the existing ONUs. 
The second groups are with low priority traffics, T-CONT 3 
and T-CONT 4 for the existent ONUs. In Group-based 
scheduling (GB-DBA), the first group and the second group 
will be performed in accordance to the number of the ONU 
equipartition.  
The two-stage-based BI-DBA has two main contributions: 
one is to ensure QoS services by dynamically adjusting the 
bandwidth between the first group and the second group, and 
the other is to enhance the jitter performance for delay 
sensitive traffic of high-priority traffics without scarifying 
the low-priority traffic performance, and support 
differentiated services with various levels of QoS.  
A. Hybrid cycle scheduling in CB-DBA 
In the Class-based scheduling illustrated in Fig. 2 (b) at 
group two DBA time in cycle (C+1), the OLT performs the 
DBA computation for T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 of ONUs 
in the cycle (C+1). At the same time, the OLT has granted 
the GATE message to T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 2 for ONUs 
in the previous cycle C, so that the T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 
2 traffics of ONUs can transmit upstream data. T-CONT 3 
and T-CONT 4 traffics for ONUs in cycle (C+1) are 
allowed to transmit upstream data as soon as the T-CONT 1 
and T-CONT 2 traffics of ONUs in the first group in cycle 
(C+1) can finish transmission. Moreover, the CB-DBA 
process executes the QoS-based prediction of T-CONT 2 in 
the OLT, and the unused bandwidth is simply reserved for 
the next group, and the entire transmission time of two 
successive groups is limited in one maximum cycle time. In 
general, the total attainable bandwidth of each ONU will 
allocate to first group firstly, and then allocates to second 
group afterwards if the remaining bandwidth is available.

performs a bandwidth allocation for each ONU considering 
the requested bandwidth of each class. There are three steps 
to allocate the bandwidth for the (C+1)
th
 cycle.  
Step 1: Calculate the Available Bandwidth of each 
group(CAB). Because Bi-groups mechanism produces two 
times of DBA and transmit traffic data between different 
ONUs in one cycle, the available bandwidth to upstream in 
one cycle B

 can be calculated as max( - 2 )all gB S T N T    , 
where S is the OLT link capacity, T
max
 is the maximum cycle 
time, N is the number of ONU, Tg is the guard time; and the 
minimum guaranteed bandwidth for ONUi can be calculated 
as min all
i iB B W  , where Wi is the weight of ONUi and each 
ONU is assumed to have the same weight. The total granted 
bandwidth to the first group 1

The pseudo-code of the CB-DBA scheduler is shown in 
Fig. 4. It consists of two parts: the process_PMT2() and the 
process_RBR(). For the (C+1)
th
 cycle, the function 
process_PMT2() allocates the upstream bandwidth for each 
T-CONT 2 of group one. The function process_RBR() then 
calculates the total remaining and granted bandwidth for the 
T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 in group two.  
B. Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in GB-DBA 
In the GB-DBA, the flowchart is illustrated in Fig. 3(b), 
the DBA will do the same operation of each group and there 
are three steps to allocate the bandwidth.  
Step 1: Calculate the available bandwidth and 
Prediction Value of each ONU (CPV). The available 
bandwidth to upstream in one cycle B
all
 can be calculated as
max( - )all gB S T N T   . Initially, the available bandwidth for 
each group and the minimum guaranteed bandwidth ( min

for ONUi are evenly distributed. The predictive value ( ,

the EBR mechanism not only alleviates the unfairness 
problem but also supports QoS by fairly distributing in a 
priority manner to improve LBA scheduling and enhance the 
traffic class.  
The pseudo-code of the CB-DBA scheduler is shown in 
Fig. 5. It consists of three parts: the process_CPV(), 
process_CFV() and the process_UGV(). For the (C+1)
th
 
cycle, the function process_CPV() calculates the prediction 
value of each ONU firstly, which executes prediction scheme 
for CBR (by using the proportion of waiting time) and VBR 
by using difference between the value of the request and 
historical information). The function process_CFV() then 
calculate the first value for T-CONT by LBA and 
process_UGV() calculates the total excess/remaining 
bandwidth and redistributed bandwidth for the heavily-load 
ONU and next group.   
III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  
In this section, the system performance of BI-DBA 
mechanisms are compared between Class-based scheduling 
(CB-DBA) and Group-based scheduling (GB-DBA) in terms 
of the throughput, end-to-end delay, drop probability, jitter 
and fairness for 16 and 32 ONUs. The GPON simulation 
model is set up by the OPNET modeler network simulator. 
The simulation scenario is summarized in Table II. The T-
CONT 1 traffic has the deterministic efficacy with limits is 
anticipated. For the traffic model considered, an extensive 
study has shown that most network traffic can be 
characterized by self-similarity and long-range dependence 
(LRD) [13,14]. The traffics with minimum assured 
bandwidth and with additional non-assured bandwidth of T-
CONT 3 are assumed to distribute evenly. In order to 
observe the effective of high-priority traffic, the proportion 
of traffic profile is analyzed by simulating the six significant 
scenarios in (T-CONT 1, T-CONT 2, T-CONT 3, and T-
CONT 4) with (10%, 60%, 20%, 10%), (10%, 40%, 30%, 
20%), (40%, 40%, 10%, 10%) and (40%, 20%, 20%, 20%), 
respectively.  
3.1. Throughput 
Figure 8 shows the throughput comparisons of T-CONT 
2, T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 of CB-DBA and GB-DBA in 
both 16 ONUs and 32 ONUs with different proportions of 
traffic profile for different traffic loads. Figure 6 shows that 
the GB-DBA mechanism is better than CB-DBA in each 
scenario, the main reason is that the CB-DBA has two times 
data transition which causing double guard time and 
bandwidth wasted. Figs. 6(a), (b), (c) and (d) show that the 
BI-DBA mechanism will reach saturation when the traffic 
load is more than 80% for 16 ONUs. When the number of 
ONU is 32, Figs. 6(e), (f), (g) and (h) show that the BI-DBA 
mechanism will be saturated when the traffic load is about 
60% or beyond. However, the throughput of any type of T-
CONT is always proportional to the ratio of traffic. It is 
noted that we can obtain higher overall throughput when the 
proportion of CBR traffic increases regardless of 16 or 32 
ONUs. Moreover, both the inter-ONU scheduling CB-DBA 
and GB-DBA can resolve the idle-period problem by 
interleaved transmission to improve system throughput.  
3.2. End-to-end delay  
Figure 7 shows the end-to-end packet delay comparisons 
of T-CONT 2, T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 of CB-DBA and 
GB-DBA for 16 ONUs and 32 ONUs with different 
proportions of traffic profile for different traffic loads. 
Simulation results show that the total end-to-end packet 
delay of GB-DBA in both 16 ONUs and 32 ONUs are better 
than CB-DBA because of GB-DBA do not have two times 
guard time problem. In the T-CONT 2 end-to-end packet 
delay, the CB-DBA in 32 ONUs is better than the GB-DBA, 
and the reason is that the T-CONT 2 in CB-DBA will be 
transmitted earlier, thus the T-CONT 2 can get more 
resources and higher service level but has worse 
performance in other scenarios. Moreover, the end-to-end 
packet delay of GB-DBA in 32 ONUs, the staggered 
circumstances have occurred because of the bandwidth has 
been insufficient to supply high-priority and the low priority 
traffic cannot transmit data, which causing the packet loss. 
3.3. Drop probability, Jitter and Fairness 
Figure 8 compares the drop probability, jitter and 
fairness of the CB-DBA and GB-DBA in 16 ONUs and 32 
ONUs with different proportions of traffic profile for 
different traffic loads. Simulation results show that the 
blocking probability of CB-DBA scheme is worse than GB-
DBA because CB-DBA has lower total throughput, and the 
allocated bandwidth of T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 must 
wait for the remaining unused bandwidth given from T-
CONT 2. Therefore, the traffic data of T-CONT 3 and T-
CONT 4 will be queued in the buffer, especially for T-
CONT 4. As for 16 ONUs, the blocking probability occurs 
when traffic load exceeding 70% for CB-DBA and 80% for 
GB-DBA in 16 ONUs and 50% for both schemes in 32 
ONUs. The reason is that the more ONUs shares the 
remaining unused bandwidth, the less the bandwidth will be 
distributed to each ONU, and it is speculated that the 32 
ONUs will have more blocking probability than 16 ONUs.

 A Bi-Partitional Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation 
Mechanism for Differentiated Services to Support 
State Report ONUs in GPON

Abstract—With the emerging diversified services, the 
gigabit-capable PON (GPON) has emerged as one of the 
most promising broadband access network solutions due 
to the increasing demand for residential bandwidth. In 
this paper, a novel bi-partition dynamic bandwidth 
allocation (B-DBA) mechanism is proposed to enhance the 
differentiated services over GPON. The proposed B-DBA 
mechanism divides the transmission cycle time into two 
groups and adjusts the bandwidth dynamically between 
the first group for high priorities T-CONT 1, and T-
CONT 2 and the second group for low priorities T-CONT 
3, and T-CONT 4. Moreover, the T-CONT 2 traffic has 
prediction mechanism and recycles the remaining unused 
bandwidth for the low priority T-CONTs. The system 
performance of B-DBA mechanism is compared with the 
Jiang’s protocol in terms of the throughput, end-to-end 
delay and jitter for 32 ONUs. Simulation result shows that 
the proposed B-DBA mechanism can improve the QoS 
services without sacrificing the low priority traffic except 
before the system is half-loaded.  
 
Keywords- GPON, B-DBA mechanism, Differentiated 
services, System performance, QoS.  
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The access network, also known as the “first mile” or “last mile” 
network, connects the service provider center offices to businesses 
and residential subscribers. Residential subscribers demand first mile 
solutions that have high bandwidth, offer media-rich Internet 
services, and are comparable in price with existing networks. 
Similarly, corporate users demand broadband infrastructure through 
which they can connect their local-area networks to the Internet 
backbone. Due to the burst number of subscribers and dramatic 
demand for diversified services, the access network is, therefore, 
truly the bottleneck for providing broadband triple play services, 
voice, and video and high speed data. Therefore, the passive optical 
network (PON) has been introduced at the access network domain to 
support full-service broadband access networks. The FSAN (Full 
Service Access Network) group was formed in 1995 by a consortium 
of    major   telecom  companies worldwide in  order to  promote  the

Academy  Chung-Li, Taiwan 32092 (email: Alex@aaroc.edu.tw) 
deployment of broadband fiber access networks to the premises. 
Therefore, the FSAN consortium had defined a common standard for 
PON equipments which becomes as one of the most scalable and 
cost-sensitive residential access technology. The GPON (gigabit-
capable PON) and EPON (Ethernet PON) have been standardized by 
ITU-T [1] and IEEE [2], respectively, in response to the increasing 
requirements of bandwidth and emerging services including strict 
quality of service (QoS). Both ITU-T and IEEE have standardized 
solutions for PONs operating at gigabit per second line rates and the 
transmission of packet-based traffic.  
However, the GPON offers multiple services with the required QoS, 
such as multiple rates, full service and high efficiency advantages. 
The GPON adapts various transport concepts, for example, the GTC 
layer carrying ATM cells or GEM frame. The GPON supports 
symmetrical and asymmetrical line rates over the GTC layer, which 
can provide full services at high transmission rate in PON 
architecture. Moreover, the GTC contains five transmission 
containers (T-CONTs) which are specified by 983.4 [3]. T-CONT 1 
is guaranteed fixed bandwidth allocation for time-sensitive 
applications; T-CONT 2 is guaranteed assured bandwidth allocation 
for not time-sensitive applications; T-CONT 3 is guaranteed a 
minimum assured bandwidth and additional non-assured bandwidth; 
T-CONT 4 is not guaranteed for best effort, dynamically allocates 
bandwidth. T-CONT 5 includes all kinds of above service categories 
[4].  
Dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) mechanism is widely 
employed in EPON [5, 6, 7], which can dynamically allocate the 
transmission window among the ONUs and has the ability to solve 
problems in static bandwidth assignment. Therefore, the GPON not 
only needs an efficient DBA mechanism to achieve fairness, traffic 
control and QoS for different T-CONTs [8], but also needs support 
the GEM operation at MAC layer [9, 10]. When the OLT executes 
DBA algorithm, the MAC protocol controls the uplink timeslot in 
each upstream frame of per ONU. A dynamic MAC protocol based 
on an OLT polling procedure which allows varying successive 
transmission intervals and bytes among various services has been 
proposed in [8], but the proposed method does not recycle the 
unused bandwidth. A new reporting method was proposed in [9], 
which the ONU reports the length of new arrivals, not the total queue 
length. And the paper [10] proposed the new ONU reporting process 
and novel balance transferring mechanism, as well as the underlying 
bandwidth allocation algorithm, which is that the ONUs reports the 
information of queue status and the waiting time of new arrival 
packet. The bandwidth is proportionally distributed among the 
ONUs depending on the reference value generated by the new ONU 
reporting process and the balance transferring mechanism. Above 
research were devoted to discussing the performance of DBA in 
terms of minimizing the packet delay and improving system 
performance, but a satisfactory mechanism for jitter and QoS were 
not proposed. 
group. For the first group, this includes T-CONT 1 and T-
CONT 2 traffics of ONUs; and the second group, which 
includes T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 traffics of ONUs. At 
second group DBA time in cycle n, the OLT performs the 
DBA computation for T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 of ONUs 
in cycle n. At the same time, the OLT has granted the GATE 
message to T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 2 for ONUs in the 
previous cycle n-1, so that the T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 2 
traffics of ONUs can transmit upstream data. T-CONT 3 and 
T-CONT 4 traffics for ONUs in cycle n are allowed to 
transmit upstream data as soon as the T-CONT 1 and T-
CONT 2 traffics of ONUs in first group in cycle n finish 
transmission. Hence, the OLT receives Ethernet frames from 
ONUs in first group and second group alternately without 
significant interruptions. Moreover, the B-DBA process 
executes the QoS-based prediction for T-CONT 2 in the 
OLT. When the predicted bandwidth has been over-
estimated, the unused bandwidth is simply reserved for the 
next group, and the total transmission time of two successive 
groups is limited in one maximum cycle time. In general, the 
total available bandwidth of each ONU will allocate to first 
group firstly, and then allocates to second group afterwards if 
the remaining bandwidth is available. However, T-CONT 3 
has minimum assured bandwidth or additional non-assured 
bandwidth characteristic. This algorithm in second group 
will allocate the minimum assured bandwidth to T-CONT 3, 
and then distributes the remaining bandwidth to the non-
assured T-CONT 3 and the non-guaranteed T-CONT 4 
traffics evenly.

Figure 2.  Novel hybrid architecture upstream mechanism.  
The proposed B-DBA has two main contributions: one is 
to ensure QoS services by dynamically adjusting the 
bandwidth between the first group and the second group, and 
the other is to enhance the jitter performance for delay 
sensitive traffic of high priority traffics without scarifying 
low priority traffic performance, and support differentiated 
services with various levels of QoS. However, the proposed 
mechanism will generate the two times of guard time than 
the original scheme [13], which indicates the minimum 
guard times in different speed rates have different guard time 
values, respectively. Suppose that the upstream data rates up 
to 10 Gbps will have more than 256 bits of guard times, and 
the authors [14] show that 10 Gbps TDM passive optical 
network with burst mode configuration can has up to 300 
bits of guard time. The total guard time in the proposed 
mechanism can be up to 300 bits in 10 Gbps passive optical 
network but the total guard time can be ignored in this paper. 
B. Bandwidth allocation in B-DBA  
The proposed bi-partition concept is employed in GPON 
DBA mechanism, called B-DBA. For providing differential 
QoS, this is necessary to distinguish the transmission data 
between two groups, treating each of group in a different 
way according to their individual demand. 
Because two groups mechanism produces two times of 
guard times to transmit traffic data between different ONUs 
in one cycle, the available bandwidth to upstream in one 
cycle allB  is expressed as (1): 
 max( -2 )allB S T N G     
where S is the OLT link capacity, maxT  is the maximum 
cycle time, N is the number of ONU, G is the guard time; 
and the minimum guaranteed bandwidth for ONUi,

expressed as follow:  


where iW  is the weight of ONUi and each ONU is assumed 
to have the same weight. Allocating the same minimum 
bandwidth to each ONU can essentially guarantee the QoS 
for high priority traffics in first group. The total granted 
bandwidths to the first group

Figure 3 shows the throughput comparisons of T-CONT 
2, T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 of B-DBA mechanism and 
Jiang’s protocol in 32 ONUs with different proportions of 
traffic profile for different traffic loads. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) 
show that the proposed B-DBA mechanism has the same 
performance as Jiang’s protocol until the traffic load exceeds 
80% in T-CONT 2 throughput and 70% in T-CONT 3 
throughput. However, the TCONT 4 throughput is worse 
than Jiang’s protocol when the traffic load exceeds 50%. The 
reason is that there is no buffer for T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 
4 when the traffic load is heavy, and we priority service the 
T-CONT 1 and T-CONT 2 follow by T-CONT 3 and T-
CONT 4.

B. End-to-end delay 
Figures 4(a) and (b) shows that the B-DBA mechanism 
has better performance than Jiang’s protocol when the ratio 
of T-CONT 2 traffic increases. The reason is that the B-DBA 
mechanism with prediction mechanism satisfies the 
bandwidth requirement of T-CONT 2 first follow by the 
requirement of T-CONT 3 and T-CONT 4 traffic. For T-
CONT 2, the B-DBA mechanism has the same the end-to-
end packet delay as Jiang’s protocol until of the traffic load 
exceeds 70% especially for the scenarios (10%, 40%, 30%, 
20%) and (10%, 60%, 20%, 10%). For T-CONT 3, shown in 
Figure 4(b), the proposed B-DBA mechanism has lower end-
to-end packet delay than Jiang’s protocol. It can be observed, 
shown in Figure 4(c), that when the traffic load exceeds 50%, 
the T-CONT 4 end-to-end delay of B-DBA in scenario (10%,

本計畫之研究環境:GPON 比其餘光纖技術標準提供更高的傳輸頻寬與更低成本的傳統語
音服務，並沿襲 APON 標準架構給予訊務優質的服務品質分級；因此成為高寬頻接取網路
(FTTx)架構最佳選擇之一，而如何達成用戶端優質服務品質的保證（Quality of Service, 
QoS）是 GPON 關鍵核心技術之一。 
本計畫之動機:傳統 SR-DBA 需收到全數的 REPORT 控制封包才能啟動此機制而導致 Idle 
period 問題，二是傳統 SR-DBA 並未考慮在 waiting time 中新進之封包，使得封包無法
即時傳輸，尤其在 non-uniform 或 bursty 的網路負載時更加嚴重，更造成預測不準的問
題。三是 GPON 標準中定義了嚴格的訊務不同服務等級之服務要求(Class of Service, 
CoS)，但卻沒有於光網路單元制定良好的佇列排程機制達成優質的不同訊務等級服務。 
本計畫之研究成效:1.光終端機(OLT)方面執行 K-群組輪替傳輸架構與其動態頻寬分配機
制之研究-在 OLT 部分進行光網路單元分群之 K 群組輪替傳輸架構(K-Partition group 
Scheduling by ONUs)與訊務優先權分群之 K 群組輪替傳輸架構(K-Partition group 
Scheduling by T-CONTs)的分析模擬評估，探討不同的分群排程方式對於系統效能指標的
影響。例:封包延遲、系統輸出率、高優先權訊務震盪性(jitter)、封包遺失率(drop
