2. Bilinear LTR Observer
Consider a dyadic bilinear system with a multiplica-
tive control input:
xË™ = Ax+ b zu, z = hx, (1)
y = cx,
where the system state x âˆˆ Rn and z âˆˆ R1 are not
accessible for measurement, and the only accessible sig-
nals are the control input u âˆˆ R1 and the system output
y âˆˆ R1. All system matrices A âˆˆ RnÃ—n, b âˆˆ Rn, hT âˆˆ
Rn, cT âˆˆ Rn are known, and the open-loop system ma-
trix A is allowed to be unstable. Assume that the bilin-
ear system (1) satisfies the following conditions:
A1: the bilinear system is observable in the sense that
(A, c) is an observable pair.
A2: the bilinear system is controllable in the sense [24]
that (A, b) is controllable and (A, h) observable.
A3: the system (A+I, b, c) is minimum-phase (has only
stable zeros).
One now proposes an observer design for the bilinear
system (1) to estimate its state x from the input u and
output y. If the control u of the system is uniformly
bounded,
|u| â‰¤ U, (2)
where U may be arbitrarily large, the following bilinear
LTR observer is suggested :
Ë™Ë†x = AxË†+ bhxË†u+ L(y âˆ’ cxË†), (3)
in which the output injection gain L is designed as in
the linear LTR observer [23],
L =

Q(A+ I)T + (A+ I)Qâˆ’Qc
T c
Âµ
Q+ pibbT = 0,
pi(> 0) sufficiently large. (4)
From Assumptions A1 and A2, (A, c) is observable, and
(A, b) controllable. Hence, the solution Q âˆˆ RnÃ—n of the
above Riccati equation is positive definite [25]. Further-
more, the relationship between the solution Q(pi) and
the design parameter pi satisfies the following relation-
ship, which is a well-known result in the study of linear
LTR observer.
Theorem 1 [25] : Under the Assumption A3, the so-
lution Q(pi) of the observer Riccati equation (4) satisfies
lim
piâ†’âˆž
Q(pi)
pi
= 0.
With Theorem 1, one can now prove stability of the
proposed bilinear LTR observer.
Theorem 2 : Consider the bilinear system (1), which
satisfies a control upper bound in (2). Given whatever
large control bound U in (2), there always exists a suf-
ficiently large design parameter pi > 0 in the Riccati
equation (4) so that the state estimate xË† of the bilinear
LTR observer (3) approaches the true state x exponen-
tially.
Proof: The state estimation error xËœ = x âˆ’ xË† resulting
from the bilinear LTR observer satisfies
Ë™Ëœx = (Aâˆ’ Lc)xËœ+ bhxËœ Â· u. (5)
The goal is to prove that even for large U in (2), the
error dynamics (5) is globally exponentially stable if the
Riccati design parameter pi in (4) is sufficiently large.
Define a Lyapunov function W = xËœTQâˆ’1xËœ, where
Q > 0 is from the observer Riccati equation (4), and
xËœ from (5). The change rate of W along the trajectory
(5) satisfies
WË™ â‰¤ âˆ’2W âˆ’ 1
Âµ

+ 2Uâ€–hâ€– Â· â€–xËœâ€– Â· â€–bTQâˆ’1xËœâ€–,
where yËœ = cxËœ. Note that the maximum of the last two
terms in the above equation occurs when â€–bTQâˆ’1xËœâ€– =
Uâ€–hâ€– Â· â€–xËœâ€–/pi, with the maximum value being (Uâ€–hâ€– Â·
â€–xËœâ€–)2/pi. Hence,
WË™ â‰¤ âˆ’2W + (Uâ€–hâ€– Â· â€–xËœâ€–)

pi
â‰¤ âˆ’[2âˆ’ (Uâ€–hâ€–)2 ÏƒÂ¯(Q)
pi
] W, (6)
where the second inequality is derived using W â‰¥
Ïƒ(Qâˆ’1)â€–xËœâ€–2 = 1/ÏƒÂ¯(Q) â€–xËœâ€–2. According to Theorem 1,
ÏƒÂ¯(Q)/pi approaches zero as the observer design param-
eter pi approaches infinity. Hence, given whatever large
constant Uâ€–hâ€–, there always exists a sufficiently large
design parameter pi such that the number in the square
bracket in (6) is positive. This implies that W (t) and
hence xËœ(t) decay to zero exponentially. End of proof.
Remark 1: Most previous bilinear observers restrict
that the open-loop system be stable or the control up-
per bound U be small, while the proposed bilinear LTR
observer has no such constraints. However, if the ob-
server design parameter pi is chosen too large, the pro-
posed observer becomes high-gain. A dis-advantage of
2
equation is Lipschitz. By quoting Proposition 1.4.1 in
[27], one concludes that
0 < â€–x(0)â€–eâˆ’Mt â‰¤ â€–x(t)â€– â‰¤ â€–x(0)â€–eMt <âˆž.
The inequality on the left of â€–x(t)â€– shows that x(t) can
not decay to zero in finite time, and the inequality on
the right shows that x(t) can not explode to infinity in
finite time. End of proof.
Theorem 7 : Consider the bilinear system (1) under
the observer-based state feedback control (12). If the ob-
server design parameter pi in (4) is sufficiently large, the
proposed control stabilizes the system (1) in the sense
that the system state x will converge asymptotically to
the origin.
Proof : Define an arbitrarily small neighborhood around
the origin,
VÎ· = {x| V (x) â‰¤ Î·},
where V (x) is the Lyapunov function in Theorem 3, and
Î· > 0 an arbitrarily small number. Also define a critical
time constant T âˆ—
T âˆ— =
1
Î³
ln
(
2Î±4Î²mKâ€–xËœ(0)â€–
Î±3
âˆš
Î·/Î±1
)
, (16)
where Î±iâ€™s are as in Theorem 3, K, Î³, and xËœ(0) are
as in Corollary 5, Î² = â€–bâ€– Â· â€–hâ€–, and m is the upper
bound in (18) below. According to Theorem 6, the con-
trolled system state x can grow at most exponentially
fast; therefore, given any bounded initial condition x(0),
x(T âˆ—) is also bounded. It will now be shown that start-
ing from the bounded x(T âˆ—), x(t) will enter VÎ· within
a finite time, say at t = T âˆ— + T1, and x(t) will never
exit VÎ· again. Since Î· is arbitrarily small, this result
is equivalent to asymptotic stability of the controlled
system.
Define the normalized state ex = x/â€–xâ€–, and normal-
ized estimated state exË† = xË†/â€–xË†â€–. It is shown in the
Appendix that they satisfy
â€–ex âˆ’ exË†â€– â‰¤ 2â€–xâ€–â€–xâˆ’ xË†â€–. (17)
Also notice that the observer-based control (12) and the
state feedback control (7) can be expressed as the same
function of the (normalized) state,
uxË† = q(exË†), and ux = q(ex), where q(e) =
he Â· ke
|he|2 + 2 .
It is easy to see that q(e) has a bounded derivative for
all bounded e,
â€–âˆ‚q(e)
âˆ‚e
â€– â‰¤ m <âˆž, âˆ€ â€–eâ€– = 1. (18)
Using the mean value theorem [28] and the inequalities
(17), (18) yields
|âˆ†(t)| def= |uxË† âˆ’ ux| = |q(exË†)âˆ’ q(ex)|
= â€–âˆ‚q(e)
âˆ‚e
â€– Â· â€–exË† âˆ’ exâ€– â‰¤ 2mâ€–xâ€–â€–xË†âˆ’ xâ€–.(19)
One will now use a contradiction argument to show
that starting from the bounded x(T âˆ—), x(t) will enter the
small neighborhood VÎ· within a finite time at T âˆ— + T1.
Assume the contrary; that is, x is always outside of VÎ·
for all t â‰¥ T âˆ—. As a result of this assumption and (9)
in Theorem 3, one has â€–x(t)â€– > âˆšÎ·/Î±1 for all t â‰¥ T âˆ—.
Then, using (15) in Corollary 5 and equation (19), one
concludes that
|âˆ†(t)| â‰¤ 2mâˆš
Î·/Î±1
â€–xË†âˆ’ xâ€– â†’ 0, as tâ†’âˆž. (20)
Now check the time derivative of V (x) along the trajec-
tory under the proposed observer-based control uxË†:
d
dt
V (x) =
âˆ‚V (x)
âˆ‚x
(Axâˆ’ bhxuxË† Â± bhxux)
=
âˆ‚V (x)
âˆ‚x
f(x) +
âˆ‚V (x)
âˆ‚x
bhxâˆ†(t),
â‰¤ (âˆ’Î±3 + Î±4Î²|âˆ†(t)|) Â· â€–xâ€–2
â‰¤ (âˆ’Î±3
Î±1
+
Î±4Î²
Î±1
|âˆ†(t)|)V (x) (21)
where f(x) is as defined in (8), Î² = â€–bâ€– Â· â€–hâ€–, and the
inequalities in Theorem 3 have been used to derive the
last two inequalities. The last inequality (21) and equa-
tion (20) imply that V will eventually decays exponen-
tially to values smaller than Î·, contradicting the ear-
lier assumption that x will always stay outside of VÎ·
(V (x) > Î·). Hence, one concludes that if initially x(T âˆ—)
is outside of VÎ·, x(t) must enter VÎ· within a finite time
at T âˆ— + T1 for some finite T1.
Now, it remains to show that once x(t) enters VÎ· at
T âˆ—+T1, it will never exit VÎ· again. To show this, notice
that whenever x intends to exit VÎ·, it must go across
the boundary of VÎ·, where V (x) = Î·. One will now
check the change rate of V (x) at the boundary of VÎ·.
At the boundary, one has V (x) = Î· and hence â€–xâ€– â‰¥âˆš
Î·/Î±1 according to (9) in Theorem 3. Substituting
â€–xâ€– â‰¥âˆšÎ·/Î±1, (15), and (19) into (21) leads to
d
dt
V (x) â‰¤ (âˆ’Î±3

Î±4Î²
Î±1
2mKâˆš
Î·/Î±1
â€–xËœ(0)â€–eâˆ’Î³t)V (x). (22)
From this inequality, it is not difficult to see that the
change rate of V (x) at the boundary of VÎ· is always
negative if t â‰¥ T âˆ—; meaning that x can never exit VÎ·
