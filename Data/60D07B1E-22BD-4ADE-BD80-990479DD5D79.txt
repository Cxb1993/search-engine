Abstract 
The vibration behavior of a translating roller-follower cam is investigated. The cam profile for 
rise-dwell-fall-dwell (RDFD) motion is used to describe the rise and the fall motions of the follower. 
The cam profile is determined using theory of envelopes. The follower is modeled as a Rayleigh 
beam. The rigid-body translation is coupled with the flexible deformation and thus causes the study 
to become a moving boundary problem. Since the transverse deflection of the follower is 
considered, the contact position of the roller and the cam is an unknown which can not be 
determined with kinematics analysis. The unknown position will be substituted into the dynamics 
modeling with considering the geometric constraints. Applying the assumed mode method and 
Hamilton’s principle, the governing equations of motion are derived to be non-linear 
differential-algebraic equations. The system vibration responses for the RDFD motion are obtained 
using Runge-Kutta method. Then, the influences of system parameters are investigated. 
Keywords: cam, follower, translating, vibration analysis.

is restrained with a rigid rotating cam groove. 
Since the follower is flexible, the contact point 
of the roller and the cam is an unknown though 
it locates at the cam profile. Two geometric 
constraints are established and added to the 
Hamilton’s principle with Lagrange multipliers. 
The transverse deflection of the follower is 
expanded with the assumed mode method in 
which the mode is time-dependent since the 
follower is driven to lengthen or shorten when 
the cam is rotating. The vibration response of 
the follower is obtained from the derived 
differential-algebraic equation by applying the 
Runge-Kutta integration method. 
 
2. Derivation of Governing Equations 
A disk cam with a translating roller follower 
is shown in Fig. 1. The cam is assumed to be 
rigid. The roller follower consists of a follower 
rod that has a separate part, the roller, which is 
pinned to the follower stem. The follower rod is 
considered to be flexible and described by 
using Rayleigh beam theory. Since the roller 
moves in groove, the roller maintains contact 
with the cam and rolls on the cam surface as 
the cam rotates. The rigid-body motions and the 
flexible vibrations are restrained by the contact 
constraints. 
 
The kinetic energy and strain energy of the 
follower, the kinetic energy of the roller, and 
the work done by the constraint forces are 
formulated first. The follower deflections are 
expanded using the assumed mode method. 
Then, the governing equations of the flexible 
follower rod are derived by employing 
Hamilton’s principle.  
 
2.1 The cam profile for RDFD case 
The schematic of a cam mechanism is 
shown in Fig. 1. The displacement function of 
the follower rod when the cam rotates an angle 
θ  is denoted as )(θS . The 
rise-dwell-fall-dwell (RDFD) motion studied in 
this paper is described in Fig. 2. The cam 
profile is considered with rise and fall motions 
of cycloidal displacement (sinusoidal 
acceleration). The displacement function )(θS  
for the rise segment is given with the following 
function: (Chen [2]) 
βθ ≤≤0 : )]2sin(
2
1[)( β
πθ
πβ
θθ −= TSS   (1) 
where β  is the period of the rise segment and 
TS  is the total lift magnitude. In this study, β  
is set to be 
2
π . The above motion is used for 
the rise portion of the cam. The rise function is 
applicable to the fall with slight modification. 
To convert rise function to fall function, it is 
only necessary to subtract the rise displacement 
function )(θS  from the maximum lift TS . 
The period of the fall segment is also set to be 
2
π . 
 
Using the theory of envelopes, one can 
determine the cam profile. The profile 
coordinates ( CC yx 11 , ) are derived as (refer to

4. Numerical Results and Discussions 
An example is studied to investigate the 
vibration of the translating roller-follower cam 
for RDFD case. Since the follower is flexible, 
the contact point of the roller and the cam is an 
unknown point though it locates at the cam 
profile. The vibration response at the end point 
 6 
deflections. Thus, two geometric constraints are 
formulated to be added to the Hamilton’s 
principle with Lagrange multipliers. The 
numerical results for the studied cases show 
that the transverse vibration response of the 
follower is large for high rotation speed of cam. 
Even during the dwell interval, the follower 
vibrates to some extent especially for high 
rotation speed of cam. The follower rod with 
larger length or smaller cross-sectional radius 
induces larger response amplitude of the 
follower. The smaller cam base-circle radius or 
the larger total rise also brings about larger 
response amplitude.

ABSTRACT 
The dynamic analysis of flexible rotor-bearing system for ball end milling is studied in 
this paper. The determination of critical speeds, modes and the unbalance response of rotor-
bearing system are investigated with the application of a technique called the generalized 
polynomial expansion method (GPEM). This method can be applied to both linear and 
nonlinear rotor system. The dynamic responses of tool-tip under the dynamic cutting forces 
are numerically investigated. The time history of response, the orbit, and the FFT diagram are 
plotted to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the tool-tip. The results verify that the critical 
speeds of the rotor-bearing system with the tool-tip are proportional to the corresponding 
system natural frequencies, but inversely proportional to the number of flutes. The natural 
modes can be effectively and accurately determined by using the GPEM, and the critical 
speeds of some modes would be excited to affect the tool responses. The flexible isotropic 
rotor-bearing system with rotating speed can excite the forward and backward modes to form 
two different critical speeds. Under higher spindle speed milling, the responses of system 
show that the tool oscillates with the cutting-force frequency combined with a longer cycle 
vibration, and the period of the long cycle enlarges as spindle speed increases. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The ball end milling process has been widely used in the modern manufacturing 
industry. Especially, in the fabrication of moulds and the aerospace industry, large amounts of 
material have to be removed during machining. The high material remove rate and high 
quality of machined surface become the most concerns in the milling process. The design 
trend of rotating machinery in modern engineering is toward higher spindle speeds and lower 
cutting forces by improving the predicted rotor dynamic behavior. The most commonly 
predicted characteristic of rotor-bearing system are critical speeds and unbalance response. 
It is natural to consider that the cutting forces and structural vibrations will be affected 
by the variation of the depth of cut in surface machining. In addition, the chatter usually 
occurs in the interaction of cutting forces and structural vibrations and will greatly affect the 
surface finish as well as the dimensional accuracy of work-piece. Several researchers have 
devoted to establish the cutting forces models and the models have been successfully 
analyzed to determine the critical speeds by using a variety of methods. However, about the 
studies of the cutting forces model, the flexible rotor-bearing have never been taken into 
account numerically. In this paper, the cutting forces model for ball end milling coupled with 
the flexible rotor-bearing system is proposed and derived by using the generalized polynomial 
expansion method. The literature review for dynamics of rotor-bearing system and dynamics 
of ball end milling are given in the following subsections. 
 -3- 
experimental data to validate the proposed four Cases. Moreover, the relationship between 
critical speeds and natural frequencies is discussed with respect to various feed-per-teeth in 
linear and nonlinear rotor systems with the linear and nonlinear cutting forces. 
The purpose of this paper is using the GPEM to study the dynamic behaviors of the 
flexible rotor-bearing system for ball end milling with the dynamic cutting forces. This 
analysis method approximates the displacements of an entire rotating shaft in the global 
assumed modes sense with ( 1−pN )-th order polynomials with time dependent coefficients. 
The relationship between critical speeds and natural frequencies is discussed with respect to 
various spindle speed and tool flutes. 
 
EQUATION FORMULATION OF GPEM 
For the flexible rotor system, the Generalized Polynomial Expansion Method (GPEM) 
proposed by Shiau and Hwang (Shiau, 1989) is employed. It describes that the deflections of 
the flexible shaft can be expressed as functions of axial coordinate, z , of flexible shaft and 
time, t , and length, l , as follow:

Applying the numerical technique by Shiau and Hwang (Shiau, 1993) the steady state 
response of the rotor system can be obtained and expressed by a set of finite terms of 
trigonometric functions.  It should be noted that the linear and nonlinear forces due to the 
squeeze filem damper are symbolically included in the first and the second term on the right 
hand side of Eq. 2, respectively. 
 
DYNAMIC RESPONSES FOR BALL END MILLING 
The dynamic behaviors of linear and nonlinear rotor-brearing system with the linear and 
nonlinear dynamic cutting forces for ball end milling during milling operation had been 
proposed by Shaiu et al. (Shiau, 2008). This rotor system assumes the equivalent system 
 -5- 
 
Responses of system with GPEM 
The dynamic cutting forces can be expressed as Eq. 5, which are external forces of 
flexible rotor-bearing system. The equation of motion, Eq. 2, by using the GPEM can be 
modified as Eq. 6.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
In this study, the dynamic responses of tool-tip are numerically determined with the 
 -7- 
Figure 2 is the whirl map which shows that the forward and backward modes can be 
excited in the flexible rotor system under spindle speeds. The natural frequencies of forward 
mode increase as spindle speeds increase, but those of backward mode decrease as spindle 
speeds increase. The parameters fN  and km  determine the excitation line in the whirl map. In 
this study, 1k =m
 
and two cases including =fN 2, 3 are used. Thus, two whirl ratios are 1/2 
and1/3. The excitation line may intersect the natural mode curves at some corresponding 
spindle speeds, which are called critical speeds. The natural frequencies and critical speeds of 
various modes can be expressed in Table 3 to show the critical speeds of forward mode are 
higher than those of backward mode. Their associated mode shapes of forward and backward 
modes at critical speeds with 2 and 3 flutes of tool are expressed in Fig. 3. It is shown that the 
eigenvector magnitude for the mode 1is the largest at tool-tip C, but those for the modes 2 is 
relatively small.

Figure 5(a) shows the displacement of tool-tip with two flutes in x direction at spindle 
speed of 6040 rpm which is the critical speed of the second backward mode. It is found that 
the tool oscillates with the cutting-force frequency combined with a longer cycle vibration. 
The period of the long cycle is about 0.056 sec, which explains the work-piece surface are 
often found to have a lot of small waves inside the long cycle wave in the practical milling. 
From Fig. 2, it is seen that the lower first backward mode with the natural frequency of 112.1 
rad/sec is excited at spindle speed of 6040 rpm. The orbit of tool-tip is plotted in Fig. 5(b). It 
shows that the orbit trajectory of tool-tip encircles around the origin with many small inner 
loops. The large loop corresponds to the second backward mode while the small loop 
corresponds to the first backward mode. This phenomenon can be observed more obviously 
from the FFT diagram as shown in Fig. 5(c). There are two major peaks for x-response of 
tool-tip with two flutes at spindle speed 6040 rpm. The two frequencies governing the 
behaviors of tool-tip correspond to the first and second backward modes, respectively. The 
obvious low frequency peak verifies the long cycle wave phenomenon. A very small peak 
near the right hand of cutting-force frequency is also found. It is seen from Fig. 2 to coincide 
with the first forward mode at spindle speed of 6040 rpm. 
Figure 6(a) shows the displacement of tool-tip with two flutes in y direction at spindle 
speed of 19950 rpm which is the critical speed of the first forward mode. It is found that the 
tool oscillates with the cutting-force frequency combined with a longer cycle vibration. The 
period of the long cycle is 0.173 sec because the first backward mode is excited and the 
associated natural frequency is 36.31 rad/sec. The period of long cycle at spindle speed 19950 
rpm is larger than that at spindle speed 6040rpm. The orbit of tool-tip is plotted in Fig. 6(b). It 
shows the orbit trajectory of tool-tip encircles around the origin with many smaller inner 
loops. This induces a confused noise of chatter. The encircled directions of small inner loops 
are anticlockwise so this mode is dominated by the forward mode (second forward mode), 
and the encircled direction of large circle is clockwise so this mode is dominated by the 
backward mode (first backward mode). Figure 6(c) shows that the FFT diagram for y-
response of tool-tip with two flutes at spindle speed 19950 rpm. It is found that two 
frequencies govern the behaviors of tool-tip vibration. An obvious low frequency peak is 
found to verify that the first backward mode is excited. That is the long cycle wave 
phenomena.

Fig. 8 Response of tool-tip with 3 flutes at spindle speed 2160rpm. 
Figure 8(a) shows the displacement of tool-tip with three flutes in y direction. The 
spindle speed is 2160 rpm which is the critical speed of the first forward mode. The orbit of 
too-tip is plotted in Fig. 8(b). The result shows an encircled trajectory of tool-tip expands 
anticlockwise around the origin into a stable loop so this mode is dominated by a forward 
mode. Figure 8(c) shows the FFT diagram for y-response of tool-tip with three flutes at 
spindle speed 2160 rpm. A distinct peak with frequency of 678.6 rad/sec and a far smaller 
peak with frequency of 237.7 rad/sec are found. 
Figure 9(a) shows the displacement of tool-tip with three flutes in y direction at spindle 
speed of 4410 rpm which is the critical speed of the second backward mode. The tool 
oscillates with the cutting-force frequency combined with a longer cycle vibration which is 
the first backward mode with natural frequency of 138.54 rad/sec. The period of the long 
cycle is 0.045sec. The orbit of tool-tip is plotted in Fig. 9(b). It shows that the trajectory of 
tool-tip encircles around the origin with many smaller inner loops. Figure 9(c) shows the FFT 
diagram for x-response of tool-tip with three flutes at spindle speed of 4410 rpm. There are 
two major peaks govern the vibration of tool-tip. The obvious low frequency peak dominated 
by the first backward mode corresponds to the long cycle wave phenomena.

3. Under higher spindle speed milling, the responses of system show that the tool oscillates 
with the cutting-force frequency combined with a longer cycle vibration of the first 
backward mode, and the period of the long cycle enlarges as spindle speed increases. 
4. Under lower spindle speed milling, the vibrated trajectory of tool-tip in co-plane expands 
outsides gradually around the origin until arrives a stable loop. 
By using numerical simulation, the critical speeds of the system and the dynamic 
responses of tool-tip can be determined. Based on the realization of the dynamic behaviors of 
the rotor-bearing system for ball end milling, a better system may be designed. This study 
provides useful information on the dimensional accuracy of work-piece that will greatly affect 
the precision of surface finish.
