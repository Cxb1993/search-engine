Due to its small size, high CMRR, continuously 
adjustable gain and fairly low power consumption the 
system is an attractive solution for a wide range of 
wearable, long-term recording applications. 
This project led to a number of high-rank 
publications: 2 SCI journals, 2 international 
conferences, 1 MS thesis. Two papers are published in 
the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and 
Systems. Two papers are published in the IEEE 
International Conference on Circuits and Systems 
(ISCAS). A master degree thesis reporting results of 
this project was accepted at NSYSU in 2012, 
entitled ’Design of a programmable multi-parameter 
amplifier front-end for bio-potential recording.’

CMOS), affects the noise and input impedance of the system. Whereas the latter 
yields very high input impedance, the former provides lower noise. The BJT stage, 
manufactured as a lateral structure in a conventional CMOS process technology, is 
proposed as a convenient alternative to the chopper-amplifier conventionally used to 
suppress low-frequency noise [2, 3]. In this project we researched a programmable 
integrated recording front-end which can be configured to meet the requirements of 
different signals in terms of input device, gain, and recording topology. This ASIC 
can be used in a wide range of recording setups, e.g. in a body-area network (BAN) as 
illustrated in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 The currently targeted application is a ‘3-component’ sensor node 
printed-circuit-board (PCB) consisting of the transmitter unit, the front-end ASIC 
described here, and a microcontroller used for generating support signals for the ASIC 
as well as for handling the data transmission protocol [4]. Sensor nodes of this type 
can be deployed flexibly to record different types of signal by reprogramming the 
front-end chip via the microcontroller. For many applications this constitutes a sweet 
spot in terms of design complexity and reconfigurability compared to either a fully 
integrated system [5] or fully discrete assemblies [6]. 
The analog front-end must also provide low noise and high 
common-mode-rejection (CMRR). Furthermore, the electrode- skin interface 
introduces a DC offset to the input signal which has to be removed prior to 
amplification. High-pass filters with a very low cut-off frequency (about 1 Hz) can be 
implemented on-chip [7, 8] or with external components, most simply using a passive 
resistor-capacitor filter. However, the low cut-off frequency results in an inherently 
long settling time. Additional correction circuitry is hence required to avoid channel 
saturation, i.e. an active recovery stage [8]. Furthermore, slowly varying drift within

mismatch between the bias currents appearing in the drain of MB6 and MB8 
respectively, which allows estimating the matching requirement for this circuit. The 
mismatched portion of the current flows into load RL. An equal but opposite mismatch 
is assumed in the complementary compensation source. Analysis of the equivalent 
circuit then yields the differential offset voltage Voff at the amplifier input:

From this analysis it is evident that the offset compensation works best for small 
electrode loads. However, the deviation can be compensated over a wide range even 
for large loads by choosing a different compensation step. This applies as long as the 
load remains static during the recording period as is the case when using a passive 
input filter.

where vt denotes the thermal noise produced in Roff. The approximation holds since 
the resistance RMUX is designed to be negligible compared to Roff and the noise 
generated in the MUX is small since only the small offset current flows in its pass 
devices. Noise source in2 is essentially given by the thermal and flicker noise 
generated in transistor MB3 [11], and in1 represents the noise produced in MB2, MB7 
and MB8.  
When the offset compensation is switched off via SPI, the input signals bypass the 
floating batteries and are routed directly to the amplifiers via an input MUX.

effective current integration time Tdx is the period between integrator reset and 
sampling of the output voltage. A subscript x denotes parameters which are controlled 
individually for each of the two amplifier channels in the system. The integration time 
is used to control the circuit gain. Analysis of the system yields the transfer gain AVx 
for input signals below the Nyquist frequency [12]:

with )1(  ACr fo , where A’ is the open-loop gain of the integrator amplifier 
(about 29 dB in this implementation), and Cf is the integrating capacitance. 
Small-signal resistance ro is the output resistance of the OTA, dominated by the 
Early-Effect of the BJT input devices, respective the channel length modulation in the 
MOS devices [11]. This resistance reduces the effective circuit gain predominantly at 
longer integration periods, leading to decreased sensitivity of the gain to control 
parameter Tdx at high gain settings. 
Since the BJT stage is geared for low noise, a high BJT transconductance is desired 
to minimize the input-referred noise contribution. The BJT is therefore biased with 13 
μA tail current I1, (Fig. 5), yielding a transconductance Gm of about 260 μA/V. The 
MOS stage, where Q1 and Q2 are replaced by MOS transistors, uses a 3 μA tail 
current to yield a Gm of 48 μA/V. The size of integrating capacitance Cf is increased 
by applying parallel capacitors as shown in Fig. 4 when the BJT input stage is 
selected. Increasing Cf partially offsets the large transconductance Gm of the BJT 
OTA to reach the target gain range of a few hundred V/V. 
C. Sample-and-hold / Summing stage 
The S&H circuit following the integrator is composed of a pair of MOS 
transmission gates operated as the sampling switches connecting to 300 fF sampling 
capacitors. The S&H schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 6 for two signal channels as 
used in DD configuration; The S&H capacitors also implement the summing function.

channels respectively. 
 
The hold signal spike is generated on this negative edge of the waveform via the logic

The clrx signal spikes are generated when the rising edge of the sawtooth wave 
crosses reference level VTDx. The integration time Tdx is thus adjusted by control 
voltage VTDX:

sample rate is 15 kHz (TS=67 μs). The screenshot shows measured results. 
 
F. Analog-to-Digital Conversion 
The ADC architecture used is based on a single-slope integrating ADC. The 
sample voltage to be converted is stored on a capacitor, which is then discharged by a 
constant current. The discharge time is proportional to the sample voltage. Using a 
clocked counter to evaluate the discharge time, a digital output is obtained. In this 
project we focus on designing the voltage-to-time converter circuit (VTC). The 
counter function can be provided conveniently by an off-chip microprocessor. A 
time-interleaved sampling stage is used as shown in Fig. 9. The switched-capacitor 
block consists of two capacitor branches in parallel. Switches S1/S2/S3/S4 control the 
capacitor charge and discharge. When switches S1 and S3 are closed, C1 will be 
charged by the input voltage and C2 will be discharged with the constant current. 
Conversely, when switches S2 and S4 are closed, it is C1 which is being discharged. 
The discharge current path for C2 is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 9.

G. Channel simulation 
Fig. 10 shows simulated results of the channel gain for both SD and DD 
configurations. The simulation was carried out on a transistor-level circuit using the 
Cadence circuit design environment. The gain of the DD structure is about ½  that of 
the SD configuration due to the attenuation of the summing circuit. The non-linearity 
of the tuning curves is attributed to a relatively low resistance ro in (4). For the MOS 
stage it could be improved by employing longer input devices Q1/Q2 (Fig. 5) instead 
of using minimum length transistors.

H. Bench test 
First, the clock circuit was tested by applying a 1.8 V DC voltage to pin VH (Fig. 7) 
yielding a measured sample frequency of 15 kHz. An oscilloscope screenshot of the 
observed signal is shown in Fig. 8. The voltages VTD1 and VTD2 are then varied to 
generate different delay periods Tdx. The measured relation between VTDx and Tdx is 
plotted in Fig. 12 in comparison with the analytical results. The measured data 
correspond to an effective charging capacitance Ctri of 4 pF and cumulated 
comparator offset of -100 mV. The targeted sweep range from 5 to 50 μs is 
successfully covered. It is furthermore observed that there is good matching between 
the signal pairs Td1/Td2.

 For the BJT configuration the measured input noise is 1.9 μVrms in a bandwidth 
from 1 Hz.to 5 kHz, i.e. an average density of 27 nV/√Hz (290 nV/√Hz measured at 1 
Hz). Using the MOS input stage the total input noise is 5.9 μVrms. The flicker-noise 
corner frequency is estimated as 20 Hz and 200 Hz for BJT and MOS stage 
respectively. Also shown in Fig. 12 is a dual-tone test, where a superposition of a 10 
Hz and 200 Hz sinewave (each 707 μVrms) is applied to the DD BJT circuit. The test 
signal and amplifier output are shown in the figure. Furthermore, the CM rejection of 
the DD structure is tested by applying a superposition of CM (150 Hz, 1.0 mVpp) and 
differential sinusoidal signals (500 Hz, 0.7 mVpp) to the input leads Vinp and Vinn, 
while Vcm is held at the ground potential. Adjusting the relative channel gains 
compensates for initial on-chip mismatch of channel gains and also for impedance 
mismatch in the lead connections [9]. The CMRR measured exceeds 97 dB for the 
optimum setting. In the following measurement, shown in Fig. 14, the offset 
compensation structure is tested.

 A new set of electrodes is used in the next measurement. Here, the electrodes are 
attached to the forearm and the EMG is recorded at rest and with intermittent muscle 
activity (clenching the fist). Fig. 18 shows the output signal after the buffer as well as 
the differential signal obtained directly from the S&H stage outputs, Vsum_p, Vsum_n. A 
relatively large amount of CM interference (especially 60 Hz power line) is visible on 
these channels. The CM component is suppressed by the differential buffer and a 
clean EMG trace is obtained at its output. Periods of muscle activity and rest are 
successfully captured.

Finally, as a test of ENG recording, a travelling nerve action potential (AP) is to be 
captured with a gain of about 1200 V/V employing BJT input. The microvolt level 
signal for this test is generated using a dual-channel arbitrary signal generator whose 
voltage outputs are divided by a resistive attenuator. The signal dynamics and 
amplitude are modeled to represent ENG recorded from frog using cuff electrodes 
[20]. The finite velocity of an AP propagating along the nerve axon results in a time 
delay between the amplifier input voltages Vinp and Vinn as shown in Fig. 19. The 
principle of this emulation setup is further described in [21]. The ASIC successfully 
amplifies the differential signal Vinp-Vinn, which was also calculated off-line from the 
generator signals and shown in the figure for comparison.

 Abstract – We propose the demonstration of a hardware 
prototype of an emulator of peripheral nerve, eventually 
intended for testing bio-potential recording systems. The results 
of live interactions with the prototype are observed on a 
customized software based oscilloscope. The emulator represents 
a real nerve in terms of impedances, electrode voltages and action 
potential propagation characteristics.  
 
 This proposal is for live demonstrations of circuits and systems 
and is based on reference [1], published at ISCAS 2012.  
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
 Typically, in vitro experiments are required to evaluate 
novel neural recording systems, which necessitates the ex-
plantation of nerve from a sacrificed animal, artificial nerve 
stimulation and a complex recording setup. Measurements of 
this kind are difficult to obtain; the procedure is time 
consuming, expensive, and prone to error. 
 We propose the demonstration of a prototype hardware 
emulator for peripheral nerve in the context of multi-electrode 
cuff electroneurogram (ENG) recording. The electrical 
properties of a nerve are emulated in terms of load resistances, 
electrode voltages, and action potential (AP) propagation 
characteristics as conventionally measured from a nerve cuff. 
The dynamic behavior is controlled by a series of 
microcontrollers which emulate the electrode voltages for 
travelling AP whereas the output interface consists of passive 
resistors which are tapped to provide different voltage levels 
down to the microvolt range. Different emulation scenarios 
can be selected by the visitor. In this demonstration, single 
fiber action potentials (SFAP) with selectable propagation 
velocity, compound action potentials (CAPs) following 
stimulation, and naturally occurring nerve traffic emulation 
with different velocity bands are provided, ultimately intended 
for realistic testing of nerve recording systems. The emulated 
waveforms are synthesized from AP templates allowing the 
emulator to be reconfigured and instantaneously produce 
waveforms of the desired properties according to a user input. 
II. VISITOR INTERACTION AND EXPERIENCE 
        The demonstrator is realized as a PCB prototype (a first 
version is depicted in Fig. 1). Visitor interaction is provided 
via switches and selectors which are part of the emulator and 
allow choosing different types of scenarios as well as variation 
of the AP velocity in SFAP mode. The response of the 
emulator board is made visible in real time via a software 
based oscilloscope and evaluation surface which was 
programmed specifically for this demonstration. The emulator 
channel outputs are digitized for display using a portable 
acquisition card (DAQ). The software runs on a laptop 
computer and the PCB is powered via the DAQ card. In this 
way, pickup of interference and ground coupling is kept to a 
minimum and no further equipment is needed for this 
demonstration. This setup is also shown in Fig. 1. The 
transient display of the emulated electrode voltages visualizes 
the propagation of AP as a velocity dependent time delay 
between the recording channels in SFAP and CAP mode, 
varying in response to the user input. When natural nerve 
traffic is emulated, the output is observed on the velocity-
power spectrogram, also computed and displayed in real time. 
These experiments exhibit how the emulator could be used to 
test velocity-selective recording properties of advanced nerve 
recording systems (e.g. [2-3]). 
III. CONCLUSIONS 
        The emulator reduces the cost, effort and time required 
for testing of new circuits and methods for nerve signal 
recording. In this demonstration the versatility and ease of use 
are experienced by the visitor via user input and live display of 
the emulated electrode channels using a software evaluation
