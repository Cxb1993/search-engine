Ecological Effects of Road Construction on its Adjacent Ecosystem 
Abstract 
The impacts of road network on regional ecosystem are always overlooked by transportation 
planners and civil engineers. In the developing countries, the scale of ecological impacts of a road 
on its adjacent areas is a dispute between conservationists and engineers because of lack of 
related scientific and systematic study. The depth of road ecological impact varies depending 
upon species and is not well studied for some endemic species. Most researches of road 
ecological impact zone are for existing roads whose adjacent ecosystems are in stable situation. 
Few studies have been carried out for the cases of roads under construction that its dynamic and 
intensified disturbances of the construction may attract or expel animals of nearby natural areas. 
Those short term impacts may cause instant local extinction for some sensitive species and 
change local biodiversity. This study was undertaken on Kinmen island, Taiwan, to investigate 
the depth of the ecological impact zone of a road construction. The species studied in this 
research are mainly rodents, invertebrates, and amphibians. It was found that the Brown country 
rat (Rattus losea), a generalist, has broader edge habitat (35m) next to farmland than that (15m) 
next to the road, and the disturbance of construction reduces edge habitat area for the rodents. In 
the survey, Ornate ricefrog (Microhyla ornate) showed conspicuous avoidance to edges since 
they prone to reside and forage in dim and humid environments. Dryness of the environment and 
light illumination of the road side prevent them from entering the edge area. Invertebrates were 
mostly captured along the road side with edge depth of 15m and along farmland edge with 35m 
of ecological edge depth due to their phototaxis characteristics. Our data suggests that road 
construction can decrease the area of edge habitat within a woodland comparing to that of 
farmland, but the creation of new edges by a road can provide more edge habitats for edge 
species and, therefore, may lead to imbalance of the ecosystem. Obtained depths of road 
ecological impact upon roads can be applied to planning, designing, and building a road with 
more ecologically friendly guidelines and principles.

According to Table 1, it was found that larger species are more sensitive to the edge and have 
larger edge depths. In contrast, ecological effect edge zone is less than 300m for small animals 
and the depth of exotic plants invasion is less than 60m. This indicates that the tolerance ability to 
edge disturbances and the size of territory of species may reflect on the extent of the edges. The 
To avoid introducing non-native species, seeds and cuttings were collected and marked from 
native plants along the construction sites and were transplanted to greenhouses for further use as 
seedlings to rehabilitate the native vegetation. These strategies are examples that can be applied 
to lower the impacts of traffic and road construction. However, the effectiveness of ecological 
mitigation measures can only be evaluated as scopes of edge effects are studied thoroughly. The 
purpose of this research is to estimate the depth of ecological edge effects of a road under 
construction on rodents, invertebrates, amphibians and other species, and to establish the 
relationship between edge area and road density for regional development. 
Scope of investigation 
In Taiwan, most new highway or expressway systems were built mostly elevated above the 
ground rather than directly on the ground. A unique exception to this was the road network 
building on Kinmen island of Taiwan. The island area is 150.5 km2, with a population of about 
50,000 and is located off the coastline of Xiamen, Fujian Province, China. For defense purposes, 
Kinmen was intensively revegetated during the Chinese Civil War (1950~1990), and became 
ideal habitats for various species, especially migratory birds. Since the dissolution of the martial 
law in 1992, Kinmen has been experiencing continuous development and construction. Most 
roads were either widened or renovated, while some roads were newly created by destroying 
woodlands or revegetated areas. One of the roads currently under construction is the route 
connecting National Kinmen Institute of Technology (KMIT) and Wuan Dau East Road (WDE), 
which is the investigation site of this research (Fig. 1). The construction of the road is funded by 
the county government to provide additional access to the school for students and local residents. 
It is similar to other county roads with normal engineering design and expected low volume 
traffic. Construction commenced on June 27, 2006, with total a length of 337m and a width of 
15m, including a single-sided pedestrian walkway. The road bisects 9.97 hectare woodland into 
two sections (Fig. 2). The area of the southern section of the woodland is 4.04 hectares, and, the 
northern section is 5.01 hectares. The investigation of road ecological effect was conducted in the 
northern section. The woodland canopy is mostly covered by Beef woods (Casuarina equisetfolia) 
with dispersed Acacia confuse and Eucalyptus robusta. Under the canopy there are Melisa 
invertebrates, the wire meshed traps were washed thoroughly of residue to prevent unnecessary 
odors. On the evening of the same day, preys were again put into traps, and pitfalls were filled. 
The same procedures were performed on the third day morning. During the period of 
investigation, two routes (I and J) were greatly altered and shortened by construction and were 
then abandoned. Since only a few routes were slightly altered, the investigations were carried out 
with little change.

Results and Analysis 
Construction period of the road was set to be 210 days, but due to design changes, at the 
completion of this paper the project has not yet been completed. Since some survey routes E, F, G 
were destroyed by construction, the survey had to be stopped. The major stages in road 
construction include excavation, grounding, grading and ditch construction, with excavation of 
the earth possibly being the most intensified and severe disturbance to the adjacent natural area. 
On the other hand, ditch construction would create an artificial barrier to prevent animals from 
crossing the road. Each phase of road construction causes different ecological impact on the 
ecosystem thus requiring a survey to be carried out at each phase. During the construction period, 
the most common mammals captured were the Brown lountry (Rattus losea), the House shrew 
(Suncus murnus) and the Red-bellied tree squirrel (Callosciurus ergthraeas). Pitfalls collected not 
only great number of invertebrates but also spiders and amphibians. It is surprising that nine birds 
were also attracted by the preys in wire meshed traps and captured during the investigation. The 
type and number of species captured are listed in Table 2.

3.1 The ecological edge effects of road construction on B. lountry distribution 
B. lountries are widely dispersed in mid and low latitude agricultural fields and grass lands in 
Taiwan. Comparing the sequences of B. lountries in Taiwan and Kinmen, 3% distinction between 
the two rodents was identified (Chen, 2004). In Kinmen, B. lountry is the dominating small 
mammal in the field and its capture rate is high during the investigation. Calculating the collected 
data of eight surveying routes, shown in the Figure 4, a conspicuous propensity of the rate of 
capture (the average number of capture per night) shows that more rodents were captured near 
road and farmland edge than in the inner area of woodland. It is suggested that the resources and 
microclimate of the edge may attract the rodents to forage where they are captured by the wire 
a gradient edge, which also attracts the rodents. The distribution of rate of captivity with edge set 
along the boundary of woodland and farmland is shown in Figure 5. Observation of a similar 
pattern of distribution shows that more captures were found along the woodland edge. Utilizing 
the same statistical analysis method but excluding routes A and E because one end of route A fells 
inside the woodland, six routes were analyzed with d = 0m setting along the boundary between 
woodland and farmland. Similarly 50m from the boundary was taken into analysis and results are 
shown in Table 4. It is shown that where d = 35m has highest r = 0.478 and lowest p-value, p = 
0.002. This result illustrates that the scope of low edge gradient habitat is broader than the road 
edge habitat for the rodent. Even though edges provide a favorable environment for the rodents, 
the abrupt change of landscape (i.e. road/woodland) may become an ecological resistance to B. 
lountry to enter (Forman, 1995). The edge adjacent to a gradual change of landscape (i.e. 
farmland/woodland) may have better habitat quality for the rodents. Although B. lountry is a 
generalist, the intensive disturbance of road construction can reduce the depth of edge habitat for 
the species. The depth of edges for B. lountry obtained by this survey are somehow different from 
those (120~200m) of small mammals of other research (Stevens and Husband, 1998; Laurance, 
1994). The reasons may be that the size of the edge is highly dependent upon landscape, 
vegetation, geology, road condition, and species, such that the vegetation cover of surveying sites 
and species characteristics of the small mammals of this research is distinct from the other two.

Similarly, farmland edge effects on distribution of invertebrates can be analyzed by setting the 
irregular woodland/farmland boundary as an edge. The pattern of rate of invertebrate captivity is 
shown in Figure 7. The results of Point-biserial correlation analysis were obtained and are shown 
in Table 6. With the highest correlation coefficient r=0.294 and the lowest p-value p=0.041, the 
depth of the ecological edge along the woodland adjacent to farmland is d=35m and is statistical 
sound. This may be explained by the attraction of the invertebrates in the woodland to the 
microclimate or resources in the area near farmland edge where the gradient of ecological 
variation is much lower than road/woodland edges. Therefore, captivity of invertebrates is higher 
along woodland/farmland edge. Another possibility of this finding is that the invertebrates prefer 
farmland habitat rather than woodland, with the woodland next to the farmland having a higher 
concentration of the insects than the inner woodland. This phenomenon merits further study to 
clarify invertebrates' habitat preferences. 
species collected by pitfalls were not as many as invertebrate or small mammals; hence, it is 
statistically insignificant to evaluate the corresponding scope of edge effect. However, by 
observing the locations of captivity, species response to road construction would be identifiable. 
(2) Ornate ricefrog 
The distribution of captivity is shown in Figure 8 in which the last survey spot of route A is still 
in the interior portion of the woodland. From the figure, most captures were located at the interior 
of the woodland except for route G. Since ricefrogs favor humid and dark environments and are 
clearly interior species, they would avoid edges with microclimate of dryness and brightness. 
Because the core areas of woodlands or forests could be their ideal habitat, new road construction 
will expel the species from the newly formed edge and force them to retreat to remanent inner 
habitat. High density of road network will reduce the interior area of natural habitat and, therefore, 
be detrimental to their population persistence. 
(3) Spectacled toad 
Although abundant in Kinmen, the captivity of the Spectacled toad was relatively low and 
randomly dispersed (Fig. 9). Based upon their ecological features, we may conclude that the 
Spectacled toad is a generalist which migrates or forages over developed and natural areas. Road 
construction may have minor ecological impacts on this species. 
(4) Spiders 
There are 22 families and 151 morph species of spiders in Kinmen (Kinmen National Park, 2007). 
Spiders are important invertebrate predators in the terrestrial ecosystem (Woinarski et al., 2002) 
and exhibit different habitat preferences (Tso et al., 2005). The spiders collected by pitfalls are 
great in number and their distribution is uniformly dispersed (Figure 10). This investigation 
trapped only ground spiders which are more mobile than the bush and canopy species. However, 
it is found that forest understory and bush areas have most abundant and diversified spider 
population (Chen and Tso, 2004), and this may explain that in this study, spiders were collected 
both along the edge (mainly bushes) and in the interiors of the woodland (forest understory). 
Therefore, road construction may also have minor ecological impacts on understory spiders

between road density and edge area ratio, γ, in regional landscape. The relation of road width, 
road density and the ratio of edge area can then be obtained as shown in Figure 13 for R=15m and 
d=15m, 25m, 35m respectively. From the results of this research, for the local county public road 
in Kinmen, edge depth to B. lountry and invertebrates is about 15m. Once the road has been 
widened, the edge area ratio in a region will increase such that the population of edge species will 
augment. The balance of the regional ecosystem may be in jeopardy, especially for a fragile 
island ecosystem like Kinmen. Some interior species, such as ricefrogs avoid roads and road 
edges, then retreat to fragmented and diminishing inner habitat with limited resources and a small 
habitat area. Reduction of their population would result and more seriously high road density may 
cause local extinction for those sensitive interior species.

Equation (7) implies that each area encompassed by roads is Am in average sense. Although, it is 
unnecessary to have Am for each fragmented area, with road density less than ρcr in the region, 
there is greater possibility to maintain enough area for protected species. Therefore, ρcr is an ideal 
indicator in regional road planning as Am is known. With ρcr, transportation planners will be able 
to assess the appropriateness of road network arrangement in regional or landscape scale without 
affecting persistence or evolution of focal species. 
Discussion 
Road ecological effect on fragmented ecosystems is an important issue in regional ecological 
conservation. For road planning, those effects on various species, especially keystone or 
endangered species, have to be studied thoroughly. But for the integrality of an ecosystem, lower 
level species of the food chain, as with most invertebrates are associated with most of the higher 
level animals and need to be investigated as disturbance being induced. This research has 
demonstrated a feasible surveying practice for evaluating the scope of ecological edge effect of a 
road construction, and provides a model to estimate potential impact of road network on regional 
ecosystem. Wire meshed traps and pitfalls were used to capture small mammals, invertebrates, 
corresponding mitigation measures should be implemented at each phase of road engineering. At 
the road planning stage, connectivity of habitats or natural areas have to be the leading priority. 
Alternative road alignment to avoid natural habitat should be seriously considered. Building 
animal passages can be one of the important mitigation measures. Regional critical road density 
is a useful indicator to be evaluated during road planning to provide focal species with enough 
area to thrive. Road engineering construction practices have to be carefully reviewed and 
modified to lower the impacts on adjacent ecosystem. Once the alignment of the road has been 
finalized and avoidance to natural habitat is not possible, reduction, mitigation or compensation 
should then be designed and carried out. The construction methods for lowering the short but 
intensive ecological disturbances by road construction would be significant in this particular 
circumstance. Some precautions can be undertaken to be conducted during road engineering 
practices such as: (1) dividing a road into several construction segments with separated 
commencing time to keep effective connectivity of habitat during entire construction period; (2) 
installing and building berms and fences along the road edge to arrest construction disturbances 
(such as air pollution, waste water, chemicals, nutrients) and prevent wildlife from entering job 
sites; (3) moderating slopes, reducing cuts and fills and balancing earth to prevent inducing 
foreign soils; (4) using calmer construction machines and reducing noise, pollution, or chemicals; 
(5) keeping job sites, machines, and materials clean to avoid introducing alien species; (6) 
reducing erosion, sedimentation or accumulation of materials to keep adjacent ecosystem 
evolving naturally; (7) decreasing the construction period by utilizing precast construction instead 
of cast-in-place, using materials with similar colors and textures of the natural landscape; (8) 
building temporary or permanent wildlife passages to keep interruption of gene exchange to a 
minimum; (9) vegetating native plants in the ecological buffer zone between job sides and natural 
areas to provide gradual landscape gradient; and (10) carrying out real-time ecological 
surveillance during the entire road construction period to assess the degree of the impacts on 
adjacent ecosystem and to provide information for potential modification for construction. 
The scale of impacts of road construction on regional ecosystem is immense. Only congregational 
development, ecologically friendly design and construction can achieve convenience and

Introduction 
   The Westernization and globalization of regional development has been dramatically 
destroying the habitat of species and decreasing global biodiversity. The significant harmony and 
coexistence between nature and human beings is also in jeopardy. This long lasting relationship 
was crucial to the survival of human beings and it was long ago realized by our ancestors. 
Experience tells us that economic development and natural resource requisition has to follow the 
rules of nature and fulfill basic human needs by minimizing the disturbance to nature. This is the 
basis of so called eco-engineering. 
    Numerous species have gone extinct due to human economic development. After 
experiencing rapid economic and industrial development, many countries are facing slower 
economic growth plus decreasing and aging of population, especially in developed countries. The 
volume of new constructions is in decline such that old and remote communities may be 
abandoned. It is time to restore natural habitat and rebuild the harmonic relationship between 
nature and human beings. The impact of human development on global ecosystem is without 
precedent. Wilson (1989) estimates that 10,000 to 15,000 species become extinct worldwide each 
year due to the destruction of forests and animal habitats. Global biodiversity, ecological integrity 
and ecological health are damaged and it is estimated that 34 species disappear on the earth each 
day we delay effective conservation. 
    The most severe destruction by humans of ecosystems is by construction of road networks. 
Road construction not only causes direct impact to its adjacent habitat, but leads to more human 
invasion and further development after completion of roads. Four major impacts of roads on 
ecosystems are (a) destruction of habitat, (b) disturbance to animals, (c) road kills, (d) barrier 
effects (Seiler, 2001).  Although there are some positive effects of roads such as providing 
corridors for animal movement (Adams and Geis, 1983; Seiler, 2001), the destructive effects of 
roads are of much greater detriment to ecosystems, so that the planning of road networks has to 
be very prudent. Five major factors that need to be considered in planning ecologically friendly 
roads are summarized as: (a) the road itself (width, pavement, mitigation measures), (b) traffic 
(vehicle speed, traffic volume), (c) road verge (width, shape, vegetation), (d) adjacent land use 
of blending ecological conservation with the EIA is insufficient ecological investigation data, 
which is crucial in assessing the magnitude of ecological impact of roads and in planning 
mitigation measures. Hence systematic and long term ecological field study is necessary before 
commencing road network planning. The basic information of road related ecological data would 
be the locations of road kill hot spots and their causes. With that ecological information, 
implementation of ecological friendly transportation systems can possibly be achieved. Most 
factors in animal casualties are biological aspects, however, certain poor engineering designs, 
improper construction practices, or conflicts between engineering codes and conservation policy 
may potentially lead to massive road kills. Therefore, some road kills can be prevented simply by 
changing engineering methods, but this is always overseen by engineers because few studies 
regarding prevention of road kill were undertaken by engineering researchers or scholars. 
Moreover, mathematical modeling of probability of animal accident is essential to determine the 
significance of various causes of road kill scientifically. Good models can be used to predict the 
number of road kills and more importantly, to assess the ecological attributes of different types of 
roads. This study is aimed to model road kill probability by applying traffic flow theory and to 
analyze the effects of road attributes, roadside trees, traffic volume, and adjacent landscapes on 
the frequency of road kill. Field investigations were also carried out and their data are used to test 
the models. Some mitigation measures were proposed based on comparison of data and models, 
and the findings of this study. 
Investigation of road kills 
    The most conspicuous ecological impact of roads is the collision of vehicles and wildlife. In 
the USA, collisions of animals and vehicles cause 211 human casualties and 1.1 billion US 
dollars damage annually (Forman et al., 2003). In, Hokkaido, Japan, 753 collisions of deer and 
vehicles (or trains) happened in 1993 (Otaishi et al., 1998). Those animal accidents are noticeable 
but road kills of birds and small mammals may be the most common and are always neglected. 
Erritzoe (2002) has compiled information on bird road kills due to collision with vehicles in 
Europe as shown in Table 1. 
Table 1 Estimations of bird road kills in the European countries 
roadside trees, was  built and the military government encouraged residents to plant so that 
Kinmen's natural environment was improved greatly. However, after the dissolution of martial 
law (1952~1992), public works and civilian development expanded. Many existing roads were 
upgraded or renovated, and numerous new roads were built. Hence the ecosystem of the island 
started degrading. Most notably, the population of Eurasian Otter (Lutra lutra) has drastically 
declined from more than 1,000 to less than 100 today(Lee, 2006). Channelization of streams, 
fragmentation of otter habitats, and degradation of the local environment may be the major 
factors causing the decline of its population. In addition, the road network may also be 
detrimental to otters because collisions with vehicles led to 2 and 3 otter casualties in 2004 and 
2005, respectively. But due to requests of local residents, the transportation demands, and the new 
codes of traffic safety, roads on the island continue being widened and improved. For the 8 routes 
of this study, all were either widened or rebuilt with asphalt pavement. For a more comprehensive 
survey, 8 major roads are selected for road kill investigation: Central Road (CR, 11.86 km), 
Wuandaou E. Road (WDE, 3.25 km), Wuandaou W. Road (WDW, 12 km), Wuandaou N. Road 
(WDN, 12.45 km), Jiochan Road ( JR, 1.1 km), Banlin Road (BL, 0.74 km), University Road 
(UR, 0.5 km), and Gaoyaung Road (GY, 4.1 km), totalling 46 km as shown in Figure 1. The roads 
covered 4 townships of Kinmen and their adjacent landscapes, traffic flows, and speed limits are 
distinct. After 12 months of investigation, road kill hot spots were then identified and their 
associated factors such as road pattern, adjacent landscapes, traffic flows, road slopes and vehicle 
speeds were also studied.

Road Kill Surveying Method 
The investigated roads are all 2 lane public roads with different road widths, lengths, roadside 
trees, and grades. Those factors may affect the types of road kills. Two researchers riding 
motorbikes at speeds of about 40 km/hr along the 8 roads once a day every day, once an animal 
body was spotted, researchers would 1. take a picture of the body, 2. initially identify animal 
species, 3. use laser distance measurer to check road kill location, 4. remove the body and bury it 
on the road side to avoid double counting, 5. reconfirm the initial identification of species. The 
patterns of collision of birds and vehicles are more complicated than other animal accidents 
because they are 3 dimensional and the ways of birds crossing roads are more varied. It was 
found that granivorous and omnivorous birds are more likely to collide with cars as they forage 
on the roads or are attracted by the heat of roads (Dhindsa et al., 1988). Some investigation 
showed that avian road kills were rare at vehicle speeds of less than 80 km/hr (Nankinov and 
Todorov, 1983). Only when vehicle speed is over 100 km/hr could birds be hit (Dhindsa et al., 
1988) but this may not be true and needs to be tested. More frequent avian road kills are when 
birds are chasing and flying low on the roads (Eritzoe, 2002). Nevertheless, in this study, 
researchers have not seen animal accidents in person so the patterns of road kill were unable to be 
identified. Since road kill pattern is significant in this study for modeling and analysis, we 
interviewed local taxi drivers and categorized 4 types of avian-vehicle collision scenarios. 
(I) Birds run over by vehicles as they stand or walk on the road. 
(II) Birds hit by oncoming vehicles as they fly up from the road surface. 
(III) Birds hit by vehicles as they fly cross the road directly. 
(IV) Birds hit the side of vehicles as they fly into the road. 
The interviews and observations did not find head-on collisions of birds and vehicles and suggest 
that birds may easily sense directly oncoming objects but may only vaguely detect vehicles 
approaching at right angles. It was also found from the interviews that 72% of bird accidents 
were in scenarios (III) and (IV). This may suggest that birds have difficulty avoiding vehicles 
when flying across roads. Avian parallax may also confuse detection of incoming vehicles and be 
will occur. Lx is the distance ahead of vehicle that would cause accidents of scenario (III), hit by 
vehicle, and Lv is the range that causes accidents of scenario (IV), hit side of vehicle.

vehicle passing Lv is taken into account then the probability of a small animal successfully

Observing Equation (12), it can be found that even though traffic volume ( )λ  and vehicle 
speed (Vv) are independent variables, there is an implicit correlation between them. In the case of 
constant traffic volume, the relationship can be clarified. (a) At high average vehicle speed: The 
term Lv /Vv is small such that probability of animal hitting side face of vehicle is small. The 
second term of exponent would dominate the probability that implies that in this type of collision 
animal would be hit at front of vehicle. (b) Low average vehicle speed: The term Lv /Vv becomes

Testing Road Kill Models 
    To test the models, two roads with similar road side landscape are selected to compute the 
road kill probabilities which J-C section of WDN Road (total length of 5.44km, landscapes 
shown in Figure 4) and WDE Road (total length of 3.25km, landscape shown in Figure 5). Since 
the roadside trees and adjacent landscape of the two roads are similar, we assume that FL, FD, and 
FA of BY equal to those of WDE. The models are also applied to discuss the ecological 
characteristics of BY Road (part of CR Road with total length of 5.85km and landscape shown in 
Figure 6). The traffic data of the three roads are as Table 4.

To birds, flight speeds vary greatly depending on species such as Brambling(24~88km/hr), 
crow (80~90km/hr), Heron(29~46km/hr), Osprey(66km/hr) (Tyne and Berger, 1959). Since the 
speeds of flying through roads or taking off from road surface are much lower than normal flight, 
it is very difficult to obtain the speed of flight. However, bird speed of flight Va does not have 
significant effect on the result in the models, therefore the average speed of flight is assumed to 
be Va = 40km/hr. In addition, the crossing speed of small mammals (mostly rodents) is assumed 
to be Va = 10km/hr. The average crossing speed for the animal is then Va = 25km/hr.If average 
length of vehicles Lv=5m, vehicle width Wv=2.5m and considering double lanes, then bird road 
kill probability Lp  by Linear Model leads to

If we assume that the landscape factors of the two roads are equal, (FL)J-C=(FL)BY, the road kills 
of BY road are then 
X =241 (Linear Model) and X =237 (Traffic Flow Model), (26) 
respectively. The results are far from observation (40 road kills on BY) and the assumptions 
about landscape factors are incorrect. Expressions of (26) reveal that road kill probability of J-C 
section is 6 times higher than that of BY road, and implies that J-C section is prone to causing 
more animal accidents. We can then conclude that basically higher traffic volume increases road 
kill probability, but the traffic may become a barrier blocking animal crossing. Noise, pollution, 
and disturbance may make birds fly across roads at higher altitudes or avoid approaching the 
roads. Lower and dispersed roadside trees do not attract birds (especially understory species) thus 
fewer bird collisions take place along BY road. In addition, increasing road width and traffic 
prevent birds from foraging on the road, therefore reducing avian road kill probability. This 
assessment may be an important tool in planning, designing and constructing an ecologically 
friendly road. 
3. Inclined Roads (BL road) 
In the cases of low traffic volume, the relationship between traffic volume and vehicle speed is 
inconspicuous because the interval between cars is large and the speed of individual vehicle 
varies greatly. Similarly, along a road, the implicit relation of traffic volume and vehicle speed is 
hardly shown. Generally speaking, average vehicle speed in down-slope direction is higher than 
that of up-slope one. 
  On BL road where road kill probability is highest in the survey, with slope of 4.2%, the 
construction were due to collision of vehicles and flying birds, bird accidents should have 
occurred during the widening of the road. This may confirm our speculation that the road kills of 
birds were mostly because they were run over by vehicle as they walked or foraged on the road 
and because their views were blocked by the slope of the road surface. Hence the unusual road 
kills phenomenon can be well studied by applying the models to estimate reasonable causes of 
animal accidents. 
4. The effects of roadside trees on road kill  
Spacing and attributes of roadside trees such as density, height, and leaves and branches can 
affect avian road kill. Dense leaves and branches can block and detour the flying course of birds 
(Figure 7). Most birds would be forced to fly low and between trunks of trees whose height may 
be coincident with that of vehicles. The consequence is more bird casualties along this type of 
road, especially for understory avians. The observations confirm this scenario along WDN Road. 
 
Figure 7 Leaves and branches of roadside tree block part of flying route of birds. Most birds, 
especially understory species, would fly crossing road between trunks of trees whose height is 
almost coincident with vehicles'. Therefore this type of roadside tree arrangement would increase 
avian road kill probability 
    To estimate the effects of roadside trees on avian road kill, four roads in Kinmen have been 
selected to observe, record, and assess the effects: 
(a) WDN Road near Shiao-Jin Road: The south side of the road is mainly farmland and in the 
north side there is about 1 hectare woodland where is bird's habitat.  
(b) CR Road (between Cheng-Kong and Shia-Shin): This part of CR is in East-West bound. There 
like the roads in Kinmen. Although accidents involved small animals may not cause human injury 
or mortality, the effects of road kills on population and conservation of rare or endangered species 
may be considerable. If roads become barriers to the migration of animals, the consequences may 
be significant and lead to local extinction of some species. It is responsibility of road planning 
engineers to reduce road kills by adequate engineering method and management during 
construction and maintenance. 
    Three aspects affecting road kill probability are summarized based upon the survey of 
animal accidents, and derivation and test of the models. (A) Road-Traffic aspect: The comparison 
of number of animal accident between J-C section and WDE road shows that in the situation of 
similar landscape, there is strong positive correlation between traffic volume and road kill 
probability. It is also found that traffic volume is the most decisive factor affecting the probability. 
In addition, vehicle speed, car length, and animal crossing speed are important factors on the 
frequency of animal accident as well. But there is an implicit relationship between traffic volume 
and vehicle speed. In the case of high traffic volume but low vehicle speed, a traffic congestion 
will be formed and most of accidents will be of the pattern that the animal hit the side face of the 
vehicle. Thus road kill probability would be increased. On the other hand, at constant traffic 
volume but high vehicle speed, the influence of length of vehicle would become unimportant and 
most of accident will be of the pattern that the animal is hit by car at the front. (B) Landscape 
aspect: As road extends to the natural habitats, mating or foraging areas, or bisects an animal 
migration route, high road kill will be expected. This situation reflects the direct engagement of 
human and animals. Tall and dense roadside trees may attract animal to approach and may also 
change flying courses of avian, hence cause higher animal casualties, especially for understory 
species. However, low roadside trees, wide road surface and high traffic flow (just as BY road) 
may form an ecological barrier to the movement of some species. Certain terrestrial mammals 
may stay away from the road; birds fly high to cross the road, and understory or poor in flight 
avian such as Greater Coucal (Centropus sinensis) will be unable to cross the road, such that the 
gene exchange of those species would hard to continue. (C) Biology aspect: Generally speaking, 
most of drivers would slow down the speed to avoid hitting animals and therefore lower accident 
in upward trend such that birds would follow vegetation and fly over road safely. The resource 
provided by traffic and road (trash, temperature, water) may attract bird to forage on the road 
surface, with this type of vegetation, the chance of birds foraging on the road is lower hence 
reducing collision probability. 
(c) Gap of vegetation: Gaps in linear vegetation (such as roadside tree) would turn out to be avian 
migration conduits where may become road kill hot spots. Therefore vegetation should avoid 
making gaps in the vicinity of high traffic volume sections of a road. 
 
Figure 8 Reducing avian road kills by vegetation arrangement which is to plant trees and shrubs 
in upward trend to guide birds fly higher over a road. 
6.1.2 Road Attributes 
(a) Hot spots located at a slope of a road: Vehicle speeds on down slope lanes are always higher 
than upslope one and birds' view would be blocked by the surface of upslope lane, such that 
higher avian road kill probability is observed on BL Road. Drivers have very limited response 
time to emerging birds in high speed, so do birds to incoming vehicles, therefore lower vehicle 
speed can reduce avian road kills. Flatting slopes, installing warning signs and road bumps can 
reduce vehicle speeds and therefore give driver more time to response.. 
(b) Hot spots located at abrupt turns: The view of drivers and birds are both limited at abrupt 
turns of a road such that sometimes the response time is insufficient to each other and 
collisions can easily happen. Straightening the abrupt turns or clearing the vicinity obstacles 
closing the road or installing temporary underpasses (or overpasses) at the hot spots. Mitigation 
measures for terrestrial animals are dependent upon species. Passages are the most used measures 
in preventing terrestrial animal road kills, however, vegetation and fences have to be considered 
as a whole to achieve best results. The guidelines of installing passages are: (a) closing to animal 
habitat, (b) closing to animal migration route, (c) closing to the places where animals turn out 
most frequently or where hot spots are, (d) connecting animal habitats. The location and adjacent 
landscape are also decisive factors for the success of the passages, therefore the surroundings of 
the passages should be considered to have the following arrangement: (a) building constructed 
wetland near passage to attract animals. (b) regularly checking and clearing the entrance of 
passage regularly to prevent it from blocking, (c) installing fences to lead animals to the entrance 
but maintaining metapopulation dynamics, (d) constructing guiding facilities such as slopes, 
curves, ditches, etc. for animal to access the passage, (e) reducing human access or disturbances 
(Lin, 2006b).  
    Road is a destructive force to ecosystem but it can also be a positive ecological mitigation 
tool. Adequate vegetation on both sides of a road together with animal passages can provide 
moving corridors and would form ecological green network which may facilitate animals with 
conduits for interaction of migration, gene interaction, settlement, and habitats. We ought to 
encourage engineers to apply principle of green network on engineering projects. Without reliable 
data or theoretical basis, the gap and conflicts between engineering design and ecological 
conservation will be expanding and escalating. Systematic ecological investigation incorporated 
with of road kill probability models furnishes engineering and ecological factors of road kills 
such as traffic volume, vehicle speed, road design, landscapes, roadside trees, and adjacent 
vegetation. The application of this study may be able to fill the gap and provide a bridge for 
ecological conservation and engineering development. With the results of this research, more 
ecologically friendly road design and construction method can be commenced and conservation 
ability of road can therefore be enhanced.
