2. Introduction and Research Objectives 
QFD is considered to be one of the very 
effective quality system tools to fulfill 
customer requirements and improve 
customer satisfaction (Chan and Wu, 2002; 
Wu, 2006; Wu et al., 2006). Generally, QFD 
is an overall concept that provides a means of 
translating customer requirements into 
appropriate technical measures for each stage 
of product development and production 
(Sullivan, 1986; Tan and Shen, 2000). The 
most commonly seen QFD consists of four 
major phases, namely product planning (also 
known as house of quality (HOQ)), parts 
deployment, process planning, and 
production planning, depicted in Figure 1 
(Chan and Wu, 2002-03; Wu and Shieh, 
2006a). 
 
Figure 1. The Commonly Seen Four-Phase 
Quality Function Deployment 
 
House of quality, as shown in Figure 2, 
has six steps: (1) customer needs (WHATs), 
(2) planning matrix, (3) technical measures 
(HOWs), (4) relationship matrix between 
WHATs and HOWs, (5) technical correlation 
matrix, and (6) technical matrix (Chan and 
Wu, 1998; Wu et al., 2005). The foundation 
of HOQ is that products should be designed 
to meet customer needs so the marketing 
department, design engineers, and 
manufacturing staffs should work closely 
together from the time the product is first 
conceived (Tan and Shen, 2000; Hauser and 
Clausing, 1988). To provide 
customer-oriented products, listening to the 
voice of the customer is essential. The voice 
of the customer may come from a variety of 
sources, such as surveys, focus groups, 
interviews, trade shows, to name a few 
(Griffin and Hauser, 1993; Gryna, 2001). 
Figure 2. The House of Quality 
 
The traditional approach to collect 
customer requirements concentrates on 
“present” customer needs. Shen et al. (2001) 
and Wu et al. (2005) have concluded that 
analyzing “future” customer needs is very 
critical to an organization’s long-term 
competitiveness since customer needs are 
dynamic and may vary drastically from time 
to time. Besides, predicting future customer 
requirements early on could help 
organizations provide better products, 
possibly delight customers, and, eventually, 
increase customer satisfaction. Shen et al. 
(2001) have developed fuzzy trend analysis 
to analyze future customer needs by 
monitoring the importance trend for each 
customer requirement. However, the study 
only uses five categories to classify the 
importance of customer needs. Moreover, 
respectively, in customers’ 
questionnaires. To determine the 
economic conditions, for instance, a 
panel of experts can be consulted to 
determine the economic conditions of G, 
A, and P in the last and the current 
periods. Later, by computing the pattern 
frequency of the two successive periods, 
the estimated transition probabilities can 
be calculated from the joint probabilities 
of GG, GA, GP, AG, AA, AP, PG, PA, 
and PP, where, for instance, GG 
represents two good-economics 
conditions in the two consecutive 
periods. The estimated initial 
probabilities are P(G) = P(G,G) + 
P(G,A) + P(G,P), P(A) = P(A,G) + 
P(A,A) + P(A,P), and P(P) = P(P,G) + 
P(P,A) + P(P,P).  
2. The state transition probability 
distribution can be presented as a matrix 
of A = { ija } at time nt , where ija  = 
{ }iqjqP
nn tt
==
-1
| , for 1 £ i and j £ 3. 
From Step one, the estimated transition 
probabilities can be computed by 
conditional probability. 
3. The observation symbol probability 
distribution in state j can be presented as 
a matrix of B = { jkb }, where jkb  = 
{ }jqoxP
nn tkt
== | , for 1 £ j £ 3 and 1 
£ k £ 3. The estimated emission 
probabilities come from their choices 
(three choices: H, M, and L) under three 
conditions G, A, and P, respectively, in 
customers’ questionnaires. Under the 
condition G, count the frequencies of H, 
M, and L. Then compute the joint 
probability P(H,G), P(M,G), and P(L,G) 
by  n
nH , n
nM , and n
nL , 
respectively, where Hn  is the number 
of customer whose answer is H under 
the condition G, Mn  is the number of 
customer whose answer is M under the 
condition G , Ln  is the number of 
customer whose answer is L under the 
condition G, and n is the total number of 
customers. Then, compute P(H|G) by 
P(H,G)/P(G). By the same method, we 
can compute P(M|G), P(L|G), P(H|A) 
P(M|A), P(L|A), P(H|P), P(M|P), and 
P(L|P). 
4. The initial state distribution is p = 
[ ])0()0(3)0(2)0(1 ,,,, Jaaaa  , where ip  = 
{ }isqP =1  for 1 £ i £ 3 and J = 3. From 
Step 1, the initial state distribution is 
[ ])0()0(3)0(2)0(1 ,,,, Jaaaa  , and the 
correspondent initial observation 
symbol probability distribution is 
[ ])0()0(3)0(2)0(1 ,,,, KPPPP    from 
[ ])0()0(3)0(2)0(1 ,,,, KPPPP   = 
[ ]Baaaa J )0()0(3)0(2)0(1 ,,,,  . 
For convenience, a terminology of 
“n-step” transition-emission transformation 
matrix is introduced in our hidden Markov 
chain model. The transformation that the 
observation symbol probability distribution is 
at time t + n given that it is at time t is called 
the n-step transition-emission transformation 
matrix, denoted )(nTE . For CR1, the 
transition probabilities, emission 
probabilities, and transition-emission 
transformation matrices are A =

The second part of the results is briefly 
depicted as follows. A hidden Markov chain 
model (HMM) can be used to analyze 
customers' behaviors from probabilities 
viewpoints. The state in HMM would be 
changed in accordance with the transition 
matrix, and the observer only sees the output 
of the random functions associated with their 
respective state and cannot directly observe 
the states. HMM is one of the best tools to 
observe the evolution of systems over 
repeated trials in successive time periods 
where the state of the system in any 
particular period is uncertain. 
The transition-emission transformation 
is used to describe the manner where the 
system makes changes from one period to the 
next. The transition matrix is to compute 
conditional probabilities of being in a future 
state given a current state. The emission 
matrix is to describe the manner where the 
system makes emission under one state. A 
case study of library users in a university is 
conducted. Four major questions were asked 
to gather the needed probabilities with four 
items to be chosen, i.e., the frequencies of 
visiting the library in-person last week and 
this week, and the average durations of time 
in the library last week and this week. Thus, 
there are four distinct states (frequencies) 
with four distinct observation symbols (the 
average duration of time) per state. 
The transition matrix is to compute the 
probability of current state given the previous 
state, whereas the emission matrix is to 
calculate the probability of current 
observation symbols given the current state. 
By applying HMM, it is able to explain the 
possibly heterogeneous nature of sets of 
observed sequences and to handle partially 
observed training data. Finally, a clear and 
well-defined procedure is to be summarized 
and the results are to be discussed. For more 
information, please refer to Wu and Shieh 
(2007). 
 
5. Self-Assessment of This Project 
First, we have completed successfully 
what we addressed in the proposal of this 
project. Second, applying a hidden Markov 
chain model in QFD to analyze dynamic 
customer requirements is practical as 
discussed earlier. Third, the results have been 
published in conferences and journals. 
Specifically, there are one SSCI journal 
papers, and two international conference 
papers. Please refer to Ref. 11, 12, and 20. 
Overall speaking, the output of this project is 
prolific.

A case study of library users in a university is conducted. The paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 reviews hidden Markov models. The framework and an illustration are depicted in Section 3. 
Finally, conclusions are summarized in Section 4. 
2. Review of A Hidden Markov Model 
A hidden Markov model is briefly reviewed based upon the references from Poritz (1988), 
Rabiner (1989), and MacDonald and Zucchini (1997). Let a finite set S = { }Jjs j ,...,2,1| =  represent 
the exhaustive and mutually exclusive states of a system at any time and a finite set O = 
{ }Kjo j ,...,2,1| =  represent the observed symbols. A Markov chain can be presented as { }¥=0ntnq  
assuming values in a finite state space S with J states. Initially at time 0t , the system may be in any of 
these states. Let )0(ja  be the absolute probability that the system is in state js  at time 0t . If the 
system is Markovian, then define 
ija  = { }iqjqP nn tt == -1| ,                                                       (1) 
where ija  is the 1-step transition probability of going from state i at time 1-nt  to state j at time nt , 
and assume these transition probabilities are stationary over time. In addition, 
ntq  and 1-ntq  in 
Equation (1) are random variables. Moreover, let { }¥
=0ntn
x  be a random process with a finite set O = 
{ }Kjo j ,...,2,1| =  and define ijb  = ( )iqoxP nn tjt == |  = ( )ij soP | , for 1 £ i £ J and 1 £ j £ K. 
The transition probabilities from state is  to state js  and the emission probabilities that the 
output is jo  given that the current state is is  can be further expressed by matrices A and B , 
respectively, as follows:

P(S2,S1) + P(S2,S2) + P(S2,S3) + P(S2,S4), P(S3) = P(S3,S1) + P(S3,S2) + P(S3,S3) + P(S3,S4), and 
P(S4) = P(S4,S1) + P(S4,S2) + P(S4,S3) + P(S4,S4), where the joint probabilities of P(S1,S1), P(S1,S2), 
P(S1,S3), P(S1,S4), P(S2,S1), P(S2,S2), P(S2,S3), P(S2,S4), P(S3,S1), P(S3,S2), P(S3,S3), P(S3,S4),

S2S2, S2S3, S2S4, S3S1, S3S2, S3S3, S3S4, S4S1, S4S2, S4S3, and S4S4, respectively, and n is the total 
number of customers. 
2. K is the number of distinct observation symbols per state. In our case, the average duration of 
time in the library are denoted as O = {M1, M2, M3, M4}. 
3. The state transition probability distribution can be presented as a matrix of A = { ija } at time nt , 
where ija  = { }iqjqP nn tt == -1|  for known i and j. From Step 1, ija  can be computed by the 
following formula: P(S1|S1) = P(S1S1)/P(S1), P(S1|S2) = P(S1S2)/P(S2), P(S1|S3) = P(S1S3)/P(S3), 
P(S1|S4) = P(S1S4)/P(S4), P(S2|S1) = P(S2S1)/P(S1), P(S2|S2) = P(S2S2)/P(S2), P(S2|S3) = 
P(S2S3)/P(S3), P(S2|S4) = P(S2S4)/P(S4), P(S3|S1) = P(S3S1)/P(S1), P(S3|S2) = P(S3S2)/P(S2), P(S3|S3) 
= P(S3S3)/P(S3), P(S3|S4) = P(S3S4)/P(S4), P(S4|S1) = P(S4S1)/P(S1), P(S4|S2) = P(S4S2)/P(S2), 
P(S4|S3) = P(S4S3)/P(S3), and P(S4|S4) = P(S4S4)/P(S4). 
4. The observation symbol probability distribution in state j can be presented as a matrix of B = 
{ jkb }, where jkb  = { }jqoxP nn tkt == |  for known j and k. The estimated emission 
probabilities come from their average duration of time (M1, M2, M3, and M4) in the library under 
four different frequencies of visiting the library (S1, S2, S3, and S4), respectively, in customers’ 
questionnaires. Under frequency S1, count the frequencies of M1, M2, M3, and M4. Then compute 
the joint probability P(M1S1), P(M2S1), P(M3S1), and P(M4S1) by  n
nM1 , n
nM 2 , n
nM3 , and 
n
nM 4 , respectively, where 
1Mn  is the number of customer whose answer is M1 under S1, 2Mn  
is the number of customer whose answer is M2 under S1, 3Mn  is the number of customer whose 
answer is M3 under S1, and 4Mn  is the number of customer whose answer is M4 under S1, and n 
is the total number of customers. Then, compute P(M1|S1) by P(M1S1)/P(S1). By the same token, 
we can compute P(M2|S1), P(M3|S1), P(M4|S1), P(M1|S2), P(M2|S2), P(M3|S2), P(M4|S2) , P(M1|S3), 
P(M2|S3), P(M3|S3), P(M4|S3) , P(M1|S4), P(M2|S4), P(M3|S4), and P(M4|S4).
