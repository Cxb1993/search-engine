ABSTRACT 
 
  The application of the linear guideways is very extensive, such as automation equipment, heavy-duty 
carry equipment, heavy-cut machining tool, CNC grinding machine, large-scale planning machine and 
machining center with the demand of high rigidity and heavy load. By means of the contact between the 
roller/guideway and roller/slider, roller type linear guideways can improve the machining accuracy by a wide 
margin through the realization of higher rigidity and reaches the high-accuracy demand. The goal of this 
project is to study the system stress distribution of linear guideways and construct the system fatigue life 
model, with the help of the contact mechanics of rollers. In beginning, the theoretical solution of rigidity of 
linear guideways was verified by the FEM software (ANSYS workbench). Then, the system of linear 
guideways and the relations between each component will be investigated carefully. Moreover, the analyses of 
deformation curve and stress components of guideway/slider for a single roller compressed between them, 
will be conducted. Moreover, the rigidity of linear guideways was verified by the FEM software (ANSYS 
workbench). Finally, the system stress distribution of linear guideways can be obtained by using the 
superposition method, and Lundberg-Palmgren theorem is introduced to investigate the fatigue life.

1. Introduction 
   The linear guideway type (LGT) recirculating rollers shown in Fig.1 has many advantages compared to 
ball guideways [1] and conventional sliding guides, such as flat ways and V-ways [2]. For instance, the 
ultimate loading of the roller guideway can be larger than that of a ball guideway, making the lubrication 
more efficient so that the abrasion of linear motion roller bearings is less than that of sliding guides. Linear 
motion roller bearings also have no stick slip. Linear motion roller guideways are widely used instead of ball 
guideways and sliding guides in heavy CNC machining centers, grinding machines, precision heavy-duty X-Y 
tables, and TFT-LCD transport systems [3]. In recent years, the speed of machines using linear motion rolling 
bearings has increased. Kasai et al. [4-5] found that carriages of preloaded recirculating linear roller bearings 
were moved periodically with the roller passing frequency due to roller circulation. Ye et al. [6] carried out a 
modal analysis for carriages of linear guideway type (LGT) recirculating linear roller bearings under 
stationary conditions and pointed out the existence of the rigid-body natural vibrations of the carriage. 
Schneider [7] developed a theory for the natural vibrations of an LGT recirculating linear ball bearing with a 
45 degree contact angle. The study of prediction of dynamic fatigue life for linear guideways system, were not 
developed in the mentioned studies.  
Horng [8-10] demonstrated stiffness equation and stress components for the circularly crowned roller

where ( )yu z  denotes the deformation curve which can be obtained from Horng [9], and ( )yp  is the contact 
pressure, v is Poisson's ratio, E is Young's modulus, is the half length of the non-crowned part. With 
displacements curve obtained from Horng [8], Eq. (1) is the integral equation for the unknown contact 
stress . Within the limits of integration, there is a point of singularity when
c
( )yp ys = , which has led to the 
term 'singular integral equations'. When the boundary condition is in the form, prescribed e.g. ( )yu z′ , then 
equation (1) takes the form ( ) ( )∫− =−

solution of the form presented by Söhngen [11] and Mikhlin [12]. If the origin is taken at the centre of the 
loaded region and the pressure distribution is symmetrical about the centre-line, the solution simplifies to

Assuming that the pressure distribution is uniform over the contact area C is then equal to bP /π . The total 
load ( P ) and half width of the elliptical contact load (b ) can be obtained from the stiffness equation 
demonstrated in Horng [10]. From the above equations, the normal contact pressure gives:

In this study, the deformation curve is assumed to be in polynomial form within a small piece of distance 
interval and can be written as: 
1+= nByz                                (6)

It is known from Lundberg and Palmgren theory that for the improved line contact condition three 
parameters , , and  are related by the following equation [27]: e c h
3/102/)1( =+− ehc                       (24) 
   A search of the literature for a wide variety of materials and for nonrolling-element fatigue reveals that 
most stress criteria exponent vary from 6 to 12. Zaretsky [28] assumes that the value of the stress criteria 
exponent  = 9 and Weibull slope  = 1.11. Thus, depth exponent  is equal to 2.61.

   Cheng [20] found that the fatigue life of roller bearings under the pure rolling condition can be predicted 
by simply knowing the Hertzian contact pressure and the contact width, which avoids complicated calculation 
of the subsurface stresses. Under the conditions of non-frictional Hertzian line contact, maximum orthogonal 
shear stress 0τ (Gpa) is related to the maximum Hertzian contact pressure  through the following 
equation: 
0p
0τ = 0.250                                 (25) 0p
Furthermore, the depths of the critical stresses under the condition of non frictional Hertzian line contact 
can be calculated as: 
0z = 0.496                                (26)  b
Therefore, Eq.(23) can be rewritten as:

In beginning, the contact mechanical model was introduced to derive deformation curve on plate 
surface. Then, Modified Hertzian contact pressure and the contact width were calculated by using the relation 
between the plate deformation with finite and infinite depth. Due to the fatigue life of roller bearings under the 
pure rolling condition can be predicted by simply knowing the Hertzian contact pressure and the contact width 
which avoid complicated calculation of the subsurface stresses, the Lundberg-Palmgren life theory is 
introduced to predict the fatigue life for the arbitrarily crowned roller compressed between raceways
