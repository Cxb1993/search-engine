英文摘要 
 
In this project, theoretical analysis, numerically computation, and experiment are used to 
investigate real-time hybrid numerical-experimental simulation, and control strategies are 
developed for compensating testing error and time delays to ensure the success of the simulation. To 
overcome the limitations caused by cost and equipment required in full scale testing, real-time 
hybrid simulation allows one to observe the behavior of a critical substructure component at real 
size tested experimentally while the remaining parts of the structure are numerically simulated by a 
computer. Computationally, the numerical model of the simulation can be obtained by finite 
element formulation, and the time-delayed control force for adjusting the state of substructure in the 
experiment is applied to the numerical model, which results in a system of delay differential 
equations (DDEs). To achieve the objective of the proposed project, a numerical tool for simulating 
real-time hybrid simulation is developed by integrating the code of finite element analysis with a 
DDEs solver. The works in the first stage is to theoretically and numerically explore the 
fundamental issues behind the real-time hybrid simulation and to develop control algorithms for 
compensating errors due to time delay for linear structures. Preliminary results are shortly described 
in this report.

done in every laboratory worldwide. However, real-time hybrid numerical-experimental simulation 
provides an alternative to overcome these difficulties. In such simulation, only the critical 
substructure component at real size (i.e., the right column) is tested experimentally while the 
remaining parts of the frame structure are numerically simulated by computer. The schematic 
representation is shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Figure 1. Full-size experimental testing, mathematical modeling, and hybrid simulation 
The challenge in real-time hybrid numerical-experimental simulation is that errors in dynamics 
at the interfaces between the experiment and the numerical model are minimized and the hybrid 
model may behave in the same way as the emulated whole structure. Although real-time processing 
should ideally take place in both the experiment and the numerical model, inevitably, delays may 
occur and result from different sources including data acquisition, control algorithm processing, and 
actuator response. These delays increase the complexity of control and may lead to instability of 
system. Especially for structural testing of civil engineering, a large delay may be caused by 
servo-hydraulic actuators. 
    This research will be first focused on theoretically investigating the influence of delay on 
control and system stability by developing the delay differential equation model of the experimental 
model combined with the transfer system. Analytical exploration may provide a systematic way to 
develop and design the delay compensation and optimal control strategies. Here, we take the frame 
structure in Fig.1 as an example. Firstly, the governing equation of the tested frame structure subject 
to an external force F(t) derived from the full-size mathematical model can be written as

where ))(),(( txtxf ɺ is the reaction force of the right nonlinear column that is a function of the 
displacement and velocity of the mass, depending on the behavior of nonlinear substructure. In 
contrast, in real-time hybrid numerical-experimental simulation, only the right nonlinear column of

where k , α , c , and β  are the linear stiffness, cubic stiffness, linear damping and cubic 
damping of substructure. Obviously, it leads to a more complex delay differential equation and 
characteristic equation. The analytical calculation of system dynamics and stability boundaries may 
be difficult in this case. Therefore, numerical analysis will be needed. Numerically, the region of 
stability of system in the parameter space is defined by sweeping a large number of pairs of the 
system parameters of interest in order to determine the dependence of the critical delay on these 
parameters. 
Stability analysis based on DDE modeling 
A simple delay differential equation which governs a single degree-of-freedom retarded system 
is considered as ( ) ( ) ( ) 0mx t cx t kx tτ τ+ − + − =ɺɺ ɺ . It can be expressed with non-dimensional

and n k mω = . In order to determine the system stability boundaries in the parameter space 
spanned by ξ  and τ , the characteristic equation of the above system is first obtained as 
2 2 0e eλτ λτλ ξλ − −+ + = , and substituting ˆjλ ω= ±  into the characteristic equation leads to the two 
equations corresponding to the real and imaginary parts as ( ) ( )2ˆ ˆ ˆ2 sin cos 0ω ξω ωτ ωτ− + + =  and  
( ) ( )ˆ ˆ ˆ2 cos sin 0ξω ωτ ωτ− = . The two equations can be solved simultaneously to express the

Fig. 2 shows the curves for n=0 to n=6 of the infinite solution set for the critical parameter pairs

defined by the curve for n=0. When the parameter pairs (τ ,ξ ) are located in the unstable regions, 
the system become unstable.

RADAR5 solver, Matlab dde23 solver, and the modified Newmark explicit scheme with 
different time steps of integration. 
Control strategy and time-delay compensation 
Different from determining the control force for linear structures by minimizing the quadratic 
performance index, a more general formalism for deriving an optimal nonlinear control law for 
nonlinear structural control will be presented. In addition, control strategies for compensating time 
delays within the feedback loop will be studied. The resulting controlled system is also modeled by 
a nonlinear DDE by adding a control force to Eq. 2. The proposed scheme for hybrid simulation 
will be used by tuning the controller parameters such that the controlled system reproduces the 
dynamics of the original system governed by Eq. 1. In hybrid simulation, unavoidably, the control 
force needs to be formulated in discrete-time form because the control signal is calculated by a 
digital computer. Thus, the combined continuous-discrete time model (the continuous structural 
model is governed by Eq. 2 and the control force is applied in discrete time) is also considered. 
Time-delay compensation strategy 
We consider a linearly single degree-of-freedom system, which is a simplest case of real-time 
hybrid numerical-experimental testing where the controller commands the actuator to drive the 
spring to the calculated next step position (i.e. 21 / 2commandn n n nx x tx t x+ = + ∆ + ∆ɺ ɺɺ ) and the spring force 
is experimentally measured in real time to compute the next step velocity and acceleration as 
 10
a retarded system compensated by the proposed algorithm. 
 
Conclusions and Discussions 
Based on the above research content, we have completed the following work items. 
1. Simulate a single degree-of-freedom linear substructure system based on the DDE 
modeling, and solve it by both the analytical method and the developed numerical tool to 
understand the fundamental issues behind the simulation. Propose suitable control 
strategies for compensating unavoidable time delays to ensure the stability and efficiency 
of the controlled system.  
2. Being familiar with using Matlab Simulink and xPC Target system through the above 
example of a single degree of freedom oscillator.  
3. Set up the experiment including preparation of needed equipments, connection of all 
hardware, and test. 
4. Conduct the experiment of a cantilever beam in the linear-elastic range and investigate the 
performance of the proposed control and time-delay compensation procedure for linear 
structures. 
5. Integrate the FORTRAN code of finite element analysis programmed by the author with

experimental results with numerical results. 
2. Modify the control algorithm and compensation method for nonlinear structures if need be, 
and test again.

Abstract:  This paper presents a computational study on a new method of detecting multiple simultaneous damages 
in a cable-stayed bridge by use of the analysis of the vertical dynamic response of a vehicle passing the bridge. In this 
research, we consider that two kinds of damage including cable tension loss and deck damage may occur 
simultaneously at different locations. The differences between the vertical displacement responses of a vehicle 
passing the damaged bridge and the healthy bridge are sampled and called the relative displacement response vector 
of the vehicle. The proper orthogonal decomposition (P.O.D.) is utilized to decompose the relative displacement 
response vector of the vehicle passing the bridge with unknown multiple damages into an optimal set of basis vectors 
formed from the ones of the vehicle moving over the known damaged bridges. The associated system parameters 
variation with the unknown multiple damages can be reconstructed further.  
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
In recent years, cable stayed bridges have become 
more popular because they represent the best technical 
and economical solution to overcome long spans and 
provide many aesthetic options especially for 
communities seeking so-called signature structures and 
landmarks. Such long-span bridges have a long service 
period, require long-term durability, and suffer from 
heavy and fast moving loads, wind, earthquake, and 
environmental corrosion. Therefore, structural health 
monitoring systems are needed to ensure the long-term 
performance of these bridges. Cable tension, deck and 
tower deformation, and structural vibration are usually 
monitored by strain gauges (Ren 2007), accelerometers 
(Li 2006, Caicedo 2005, Macdonald 2005, and Ren 
2005), laser vibrometers (Miyashita 2008, and Mehrabi 
2006), polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF piezoelectric film 
sensors (Liao 2001 and Wang 1999), optic fiber sensors 
(Li 2006), and global position systems (GPS) (Li 2006 
and Watson 2007). Most of these sensors are attached or 
embedded in structural members of a bridge. However, it 
takes a lot of costs and manpower to maintain sensors or 
replace them if needed. Instead, Yang et al. (2004 and 
2005) provided the idea of using a vehicle moving over a 
bridge as a message carrier of the dynamic properties of 
the bridge, and theoretically and experimentally 
investigated the feasibility of extracting bridge 
frequencies from a passing vehicle. Compared with the 
aforementioned techniques of measurements, this 
method is cost-effective because it can reduce the 
number of needed sensors and the sensors installed in the 
vehicle are easy to maintain. 
For the cable-stayed bridges, stay cables are the most 
critical structural elements to offer the designed 
load-bearing ability. Thus, monitoring of the cable 
tension and its variation of cable-stayed bridges is very 
important and necessary. Traditionally, each cable is 
instrumented by sensors (e.g., accelerometers), and 
vibratory frequencies of cables are calculated from the 
directly measured data or identified by some modal 
identification techniques from ambient vibration 
measurements and finite element modeling (Macdonald 
2005, Ren 2005, and Weng 2008). Then, the cable 
tension is estimated through mathematical relationships 
between the frequencies and the cable force (Caicedo 
2005, Miyashita 2008, Mehrabi 2006, Liao 2001, and 
Wang 1999). In contrast, this paper presents a 
preliminary and computational study on a new method of 
detecting tension variations of multiple cables and deck 
damage at different locations in a cable-stayed bridge by 
use of the analysis of the vertical dynamic response of a 
vehicle passing the bridge.

3.  DAMAGE DETECTION TECHNIQUE 
 
In this study, two kinds of damage considered are 
stiffness reduction of the continuously distributed springs 
resulting from cable tension relaxation and flexural 
rigidity loss of the beam due to the fracture and 
deterioration of deck material. When the proposed 
damage detection technique is applied, we need to 
determine how many sample damage cases are 
considered. Each sample damage case refers to one kind 
of damage at one location with some damage level. 
These damage cases may take place simultaneously. The 
challenge is how to identify multiple damage cases by 
only use of the vertical responses of a vehicle. For this 
purpose, the vertical dynamic responses of the vehicle 
passing the healthy bridge and the bridge where all 
possible cases of damage are respectively imposed are 
simulated. Then, the differences between the vertical 
dynamic responses of the vehicle passing the damaged 
bridge and the healthy bridge are collected for all sample 
damage cases, and organized as column vectors in a 
matrix Q as follows 
 [ ]kzzzQ    21 ⋯= , (12) 
where hkk zzz −= , k is the number of the sample 
damage cases, kz and hz are the vectors of the vertical 
response of the vehicle moving over the damaged bridge 
for the kth sample damage case and the healthy bridge 
respectively, and kz  is named the relative vertical 
response vector of the vehicle for the kth sample damage 
case. Thus, each column vector is associated with a 
single damage case that refers to a set of known system 
parameter variations. The corresponding sets of known 
system parameter variations to all sample damage cases 
are also grouped as column vectors in a matrix P. Then, 
the test damage case is considered for a general scenario 
where multiple damage cases occur, and the relative 
dynamic response vector of the vehicle for the test 
damage case testz  is calculated. To evaluate the 
performance of the proposed technique, the parameter 
variations for the test case are reconstructed through 
P.O.D. based on the relative dynamic responses of the 
vehicle for all sample damage cases included in Q.  
First, a correlation matrix C is calculated as 
QQC T= . The distribution of the magnitude of the 
eigenvalues of C can be used to judge if the column 
vectors in Q are linear independent. The linear 
independence provides the possibility of distinguishing 
between these sample damage cases. The number of 
eigenvalues m with large magnitude indicates the number 
of identifiable damage cases, and it dictates the minimum 
number of basis vectors needed for the associated 
parameters reconstruction. The eigenvectors vi with 
i=1,…, m corresponding to the m largest eigenvalues are 
grouped in a matrix V. The proper orthogonal 
decomposition results in a set of optimal basis vectors 
arranged in a matrix D as 
 QVD = . (13) 
Next, the relative dynamic response vector of the vehicle 
for the test damage case testz  can be regarded as a 
linear combination of these optimal basis vectors as 
follows  
 Dαz =test , (14) 
where α  is the vector of weighting coefficients. These 
coefficients can be obtained by solving an 
underdetermined set of linear equations in a linear least 
squares sense as 
 ( ) testTT zDDDα 1−= . (15) 
Furthermore, the vector of weighting coefficients α  
associated with kzzz 2    1 ⋯  to represent testz  in a 
linear combination form are written as   
 Vαα = . (16) 
Finally, the corresponding parameter variations to the 
test damage case can be identified from the known 
parameter variations associated with all the sample 
damage cases by  
 αPp =
.ident , (17) 
which indicate the type, extent, and location of multiple 
simultaneous damages for the test damage case.

from Eq. (14) to Eq. (17). 
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed 
technique to detect unknown multiple simultaneous 
damages, we consider 0.1% loss of Km28~Km30 and 
Im28~Im30. The relative displacement of the car-body of 
the vehicle passing the damaged bridge for this case is 
plotted as shown in Fig. 9. The comparison between the 
specified parameter variations and the identified ones by 
the proposed method for this test case is presented in 
Table 4. One may find that multiple damages occurring 
at adjacent locations can be distinguished, and the 
damage type (e.g., spring stiffness reduction due to cable 
tension loss or reduction of moment of inertia of deck) 
and the damage level (i.e. the reduction percentage) are 
almost accurately detected. 
In addition, cable tension loss can be interrogated 
through the identified stiffness reduction of equivalent 
continuously distributed springs. By substituting Eq. (1) 
and (2) into Eq. (3), cable tension can be represented as

 When the stiffness reduction is identified, the 
current cable tension can be calculated by substituting 
the updated Kvt* into the above equation, and the cable 
tension loss can be obtained further. For example, the 
loss percentage of the eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth 
cable causing 0.1% reduction of Ks6, Ks7, and Ks8 are 
respectively 4.05%, 5.26%, and 3.14%.  
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this paper, a new method of detecting multiple 
simultaneous damages in a cable-stayed bridge using the 
analysis of the vertical dynamic response of a vehicle 
passing the bridge is demonstrated. The vertical vibration 
interaction of the vehicle-cable stayed bridge system is 
simulated by a finite element method. Two kinds of 
damage including cable tension loss and deck damage 
are considered to occur singly or simultaneously at 
different locations. The unknown multiple damages can 
be reconstructed by decomposing the relative 
displacement response vector of the vehicle passing the 
bridge with unknown multiple damages into the ones of 
the vehicle moving over the bridges with known 
damages based on proper orthogonal decomposition. The 
accurate results can be obtained when two requirements 
are satisfied. First, a care must be taken of choosing a set 
of sample damage cases which covers the most likely 
single damage scenarios such that the system parameter 
variations associated with the unknown damage case lies 
within the range of the ones associated with the sample 
damage cases. Second, the relative vertical response 
vectors of the vehicle for all the sample damage cases are 
linearly independent. Note that, in addition to 
displacement response, velocity and acceleration 
responses of the vehicle can be used in the proposed 
method as long as the second requirement is satisfied.

Real-time hybrid numerical-experimental simulation overcomes many past 
limitations on testing of large structures and provides an efficient way to test 
critical structural components and specific devices installed in the structure. 
The expertise and competence of handling stability and compensating time delay 
in real-time hybrid simulation gained from this project provide a basis for future 
research involving real large-scale experimental works.
