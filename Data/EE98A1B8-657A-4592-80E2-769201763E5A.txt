為了改善上述準諧振與多諧振整流器之諸
多缺點，故在90年初期，許多學者專家提出能
實現固定頻率控制的柔性切換技術。雖然提出
ZVS-PWM與ZCS-PWM整流器可控制諧振發生
的時機，使主功率開關操作於固定切換頻率，
但是主要的能量傳輸仍需經過諧振電感，因此
會造成額外的傳導損失，且電路元件必須承受
諧振而產生的大電壓與大電流應力。故有學者
提出ZVT-PWM與ZCT-PWM整流器，以消除上
述ZVS-PWM與ZCS-PWM整流器之缺點。其主
要特點係將輔助諧振元件從主要能量傳輸的路
徑移開，置於與主功率開關元件並聯，因此可
以避免額外的傳導損失，此外輔助開關導通在
主開關切換前的瞬間，其他時間均為截止狀
態，所以諧振現象只有發生在主開關切換的瞬
間，故電路元件可以有效地避免大電壓與大電
流應力。ZVT-PWM與ZCT-PWM整流器與其它
柔性切換整流器比較，具有較低的傳導損失與
元件應力，但輔助開關仍是操作於硬式切換，
因此電路存在與切換頻率成正比的切換損失。
另一方面，前述各種整流器僅能操作於單一象
限，故無法應用於如圖 1 所示之再生制動
(regenerative braking)系統，圖1之中常用兩象限
式轉換器一般採用硬式切換之單相全橋式SMR 
[9-16]，但此架構隨著開關切換頻率上升，開關
之切換損失亦隨之增加，導致整體系統之效率
大幅降低。 
有鑑於上述之情形，本計畫乃提出新型單
相全橋式柔性切換整流器 (Full-bridge soft 
switching mode rectifier, FBSSMR)，如圖2所
示。期能有效解決上述習用單相切換式整流器
之缺點。所研製之FBSSMR係在傳統硬式切換
單相全橋式整流器中，外加一輔助諧振電路，
在主功率開關導通與截止交替之際，令輔助開
關
5S 或 6S 先行導通一短暫時刻，使外加之諧振
電感
rL 與主功率開關( 1S ~ 4S )之寄生電容產生諧
振，使即將導通之主功率開關之電壓先降為零
後，再予以觸發導通，以達到零電壓切換之目
標，可降低主功率開關之切換損失，並使主功
率開關之切換應力減小，同時也降低切換時所
產生之電磁干擾。另一方面，因輔助開關係在
諧振電感電流降為零時，再將輔助開關截止，
故輔助開關可達到零電流切換之特性。因主功
率開關導通時，操作於零電壓切換，而輔助開
關於截止時，操作於零電流切換，故可大幅降
低切換損失，提高整體之效率。詳細各工作模
式說明敬請參閱下一節之研究方法。

二、研究目的 
    本本計畫之主要目的，係在研製新型單相
全橋式柔性切換整流器，俾能有效降低切換損
失，提高整體系統之效率。其特徵乃在於功率
電路僅在傳統硬式切換全橋式整流器中，外加
一組輔助開關;而於控制電路中，主功率開關之

為零電流導通。在此模式中，諧振電感 rL 兩端
電壓為 dcV ，故諧振電感電流 rLi 由零線性上升至
max,sI 如圖 4 所示。在此模式之各方程式如下所
示。

模式 3 ( 21 ttt << )：圖 3(c)所示為模式 3
之操作電路，當 1tt = 時，主開關 1S 與 2S 截止，
此時各主開關均為截止狀態即進入空白時間
(Blanking time)，只剩輔助開關 5S 仍為導通狀
態，所以在此模式中，整流器上之諧振電感 rL
與各諧振電容開始產生諧振， )(1 tvcr 與 )(2 tvcr 因
諧振之關係，其電壓由零上升至 dcV ， )(3 tvcr 與

)(4 tvcr 之電壓降為零時，將造成主開關 3S 與 4S

模式 4 ( 32 ttt << )：圖 3(d)所示為模式 4
之操作電路，當 2tt = 時，由於主開關 3S 與 4S
上之反向並聯二極體導通，故主開關 3S 與 4S 此
時觸發導通可達到零電壓導通之目標，此時諧
振電感 rL 二端電壓為 dcV− ，故諧振電感電流 rLi
開始線性下降至零。在此模式之各方程式如下

模式 5 ( 43 ttt << )：圖 3(e)所示為模式 5
之操作電路，當 3tt = 時，由於諧振電感上之電
流為零，故此時輔助開關 5S 截止，可達到零電
流截止之目標，另外在此模式中主開關 3S 與 4S
為導通狀態，故 043 == crcr vv V ， 1S 與 2S 則為
截止狀態，故 dccrcr Vvv == 21 ， sI 經由主開關 3S
與 4S 對輸出端傳送能量，且此時諧振網路上之
輔助開關 5S 與 6S 均為截止狀態，因此諧振電感
上之電流
rL
i 為零，故諧振網路在穩態工作時視
同斷路，故不會增加額外的電壓或電流應力與
傳導損失，且保有硬式切換整流器穩態工作之
優點。在此模式之各方程式如下所示。

              0)(3 =tvcr                                    (24) 
              0)(4 =tvcr                                (25) 
 
模式 6 ( 54 ttt << )：圖 3(f)所示為模式 6
之操作電路，當 4tt = 時，輔助開關 6S 導通，此
時諧振網路上之電流
rL
i 為零，故輔助開關 6S 為
零電流導通。在此模式中，諧振電感 rL 兩端為
dcV− ，故諧振電感電流 rLi 由零線性下降至
max,sI− 如圖 4 所示。在此模式之各方程式如下
所示。

               0)(2 =tvcr                           (38)

               dccr Vtv =)(4                         (40) 
在經由模式 8 之後，當 87 ttt << 時，電路
之操作又回到最初的模式 1， sI 經由主開關 1S
與 2S 對輸出傳送能量，且此時諧振網路上之輔
助開關 5S 與 6S 均為截止狀態，由上述之操作模
式說明可知，主開關( 1S ~ 4S )操作於零電壓切
換，輔助開關( 5S 、 6S )則操作於零電流切換，
而諧振現象係發生在主開關切換瞬間，由於諧
振發生之時間極短暫，故不會造成功率電路元
件過大之電壓及電流應力，且整流器仍保有硬
式切換整流器穩態工作之優點。 
 
3.2 諧振電感之設計 
諧振電感之選擇將影響整流器上開關是否
為柔性切換，並且是系統整體效率之關鍵，若
電感值選擇太大，則諧振電感 rL 無法與諧振電
容產生諧振，而造成各功率開關無法柔性切
換；相反地，若電感值選擇太小，將會造成功
率電路元件之電流應力增加，且會產生較大之
傳導損失，進而影響整體效率。設計之關鍵在
於諧振電感電流必須大於交流輸入側之電感電
流 si ，才可確保整流器柔性切換。 
考慮含漣波電流時， si 之最大值為

3.3 整流器之小信號推導

其中 v 與 i 分別為交流側相電壓及電流之有效
值。由(43)知由交流側輸入之功率與直流側供
給負載之功率相等。另外，因整流器交流側之
電流係採用電流控制迴路，其響應速度遠快於
外迴路之直流輸出電壓控制迴路，因此，在推
導系統之轉移函數只需要考慮直流側之動態行
為。在推導中所用小信號量 oriv ~,

                   iIi ~+=                                     (45)

因反向回復電流導致小部份之切換損失Ploss，
故所提之整流器之輔助開關也具柔性切換之特
性。圖10-11所示為所提整流器之輸入電壓與電
流之模擬與實測波形，由圖中可知，輸入電流is
趨近純弦波且與電源電壓vac同相位，硬體實測
交流側輸入電流之THD為2.81 % 而功率因數為
0.99。圖11(b)所示為輸入電流與其頻譜之實測
圖，由圖中可知，輸入電流is之低次諧波振幅已
大幅減小。暫態實測結果，係將負載電阻作步
級變化，將輸出功率由50W步級變化至400W，
其模擬與實測之結果如圖12-13所示。由圖中明
顯可知，當輸出功率瞬間加載至400W時，前饋
控制器能快速反應負載之變動，只需約6 mS 即
可達到穩態工作，故直流輸出電壓Vdc可保持平
穩輸出。於輸出功率400W時，所研製之柔性切
換整流器之整體效率可達93.5%。

II. PROPOSED SOFT-SWITCHING RECTIFIER 
A. Full-bridge Soft-Switching Rectifier 
A block diagram of the proposed FBSSR is shown in Fig. 
1. It consists mainly of a power stage, a voltage controller, a 
feed-forward controller, a current reference generator, a 
current controller, a PWM switching scheme, and a zero 
voltage switching signal generator. The power stage can be 
divided into two sections. The first section is a conventional 
full-bridge PWM rectifier. It is composed of  switches S1, S2, 
S3, and S4, their body diodes D1, D2, D3, and D4, an input boost 
inductor LS and an output capacitor C. The second section is 
the proposed new simple ZVS-PWM commutation cell, 
composed of S5, S6, Lr, Cr1, Cr2, Cr3, and Cr4. This section is 
synchronous with the circuit of the first section. It provides the 
ZVS on all semiconductors in the full-bridge PWM rectifier.  
 
B. Principle of Operation 
To simplify the analysis, the following assumptions are 
made during one switching cycle: (i) input boost inductor LS is 
sufficiently large that the input current can be considered to be 
ripple-free, iS=IS; (ii) the output capacitor C is large enough 
that the dc output voltage can be assumed to be constant, 
vo=Vdc; (iii) all values of resonant capacitors are identical, i.e., 
Cr1=Cr2=Cr3=Cr4≣Cr, where Cr is the sum of the MOSFET’s 
parasitic capacitance; and (v) all components and devices are 
ideal. On the basis of these assumptions, the circuit operations 
in one switching cycle can be divided into eight modes. The 
eight dynamic equivalent circuits are shown in Fig. 2. The 
theoretical waveforms of the proposed soft-switching rectifier 
are shown in Fig. 3. 
 
Mode 0 (t < t0): Initially, assume that the switches S1 and 
S2 are conducting the source current, and that the initial 
conditions are the resonant voltages  vcr1(t)=vcr2(t)=0 and the 
resonant voltages vcr3(t)=vcr4(t)=Vdc. The auxiliary switches S5 
and S6 are turned off and the resonant current iLr(t)=0, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). The resonant current and capacitor 
voltages can be described as 
 
0)( =tiLr  (1) 
0)()( 21 == tvtv crcr  (2) 
dccrcr Vtvtv == )()( 43  (3) 
 
Mode 1 (t0 < t < t1): As shown in Fig. 2(b), this mode 
begins when S5 is turned on with ZCS at t = t0. The resonant 
inductor Lr charges linearly from output dc voltage Vdc. The 
resonant current iLr(t) is increased linearly. This mode ends 
when the switches S1 and S2 are turned off with ZVS at t=t1. 
The resonant current and capacitor voltages can be described 
as

ti
r
dc
Lr −=  (4) 
0)()( 21 == tvtv crcr  (5) 
dccrcr Vtvtv == )()( 43  (6) 
 
Mode 2 (t1 < t < t2): As shown in Fig. 2(c), the resonant 
inductor Lr and the resonant capacitors Cr1, Cr2, Cr3 and Cr4 
form a resonant tank. At first, the resonant current iLr(t) 
increases and then decreases when it reaches its peak value. 
This mode is finished when the resonant voltages vcr3(t) and 
vcr4(t) drop to zero and the resonant voltages vcr1(t) and vcr2(t) 
reach Vdc. The resonant current and capacitor voltages can be 
described as

the resonant circuit, respectively. 
 
Mode 3 (t2 < t < t3): As shown in Fig. 2(d), since the 
resonant voltages vcr3(t) and vcr4(t) equal zero, the body diodes 
D3 and D4 start to conduct.  The switches S3 and S4 are turned 
on during this interval with ZVS commutation. The energy 
stored in the resonant inductor Lr is delivered back to the 
output dc voltage. The resonant current iLr(t) is decreased 
linearly. This mode ends when the resonant current iLr(t) drops 
to zero. The resonant current and capacitor voltages can be 
described as

Mode 4 (t3 < t < t4): As shown in Fig. 2(e), the switches S3 
and S4 are conducting the source current, and the resonant 
voltages vcr3(t)=vcr4(t)=0 and the resonant voltages vcr1(t) 
=vcr2(t) =Vdc. The auxiliary switches S5 and S6 are turned off

Mode 7 (t6 < t < t7): As shown in Fig. 2 (h), since the 
resonant voltages vcr1(t) and vcr2(t) equal zero, the body diodes 
D1 and D2 start to conduct. The switches S1 and S2 are turned 
on during this interval with ZVS commutation. The energy 
stored in the resonant inductor Lr is delivered back to the 
output dc voltage. The resonant current iLr(t) is increased 
linearly. This mode ends when the resonant current iLr(t) drops 
to zero. The resonant inductor current and capacitor voltages 
can be described as

After mode 7, the circuit operation is returned to mode 0. 
Through the analysis presented above, key waveforms of the 
proposed FBSSR can be plotted as shown in Fig. 3. 
III. DERIVATION OF THE DYNAMIC MODEL 
For convenient controller design, a dynamic model of the 
rectifier is derived in this section. It is assumed that the 
parasitic loss can be neglected and the input current is 
sinusoidal and in phase with the voltage source. Hence, from 
conservation of power, one can obtain

o
o r
vCv
dt
dvi

2 ]

1[ +=  (27) 
where v and i are the RMS voltage and current of ac source, 
respectively. Equation (27) means that the input power is 
equal to the sum of the increased power stored in the capacitor 
and the power delivered to the load. The dynamic behavior of 
the inductor can be neglected because the input current has 
been controlled by the fast response current controller. The 
small signals v~ , i~ , or~ , ov~  are defined according to the  
following relations 
vVv ~+=  (28) 
iIi ~+=  (29) 
ooo rRr ~+=  (30) 
ooo vVv ~+=  (31) 
Then, by using the above small perturbation and after 
linearization, we obtain the DC equation from (27),

IV. DESIGN OF THE FEED-FORWARD  CONTROLLER 
To achieve zero output impedance and zero audio 
susceptibility, Fig. 4 shows the block diagram of the proposed 
control strategy. There are three inputs and one output. Also, 
for simplicity, proportional control is chosen for the feed-
forward controller, and a simple PI control is chosen for the 
feedback controller (Gc(s)). It follows from Fig. 4 that one can 
obtain

where Zout is the output impedance and Sv is the audio

Thus, from (43) it can be seen that due to addition of the 
proposed feed-forward control, the influence of the line 
voltage variation and the output current variation can now be 
eliminated. Also, from (40) and (41) it can be seen that Fi and 
Fv are independent of all circuit parameters. In fact, it is

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, analysis, design and control of a novel 
single-phase full-bridge soft-switching rectifier with a unity 
power factor, a sinusoidal input current, a regulated dc output 
and a bidirectional power flow capability have been presented. 
In the proposed soft-switching rectifier, all main switches 
operate at ZVS turn-on and turn-off, and the auxiliary 
switches operate at ZCS turn-on and turn-off. Therefore, the 
proposed rectifier performs significantly better than its hard-
switching counterpart in switching loss and dv/dt reduction. 
Moreover, a small signal model is derived and, in addition to 
the feedback control, an adaptive feed-forward control is 
proposed to achieve good dynamic regulation. Finally, some 
experimental results are provided to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed soft-switching rectifier.

II. PROPOSED SINGLE-PHASE SOFT-SWITCHING ACTIVE 
POWER FILTER
A. System Configuration 
The block diagram of the proposed single-phase SSAPF, as 
shown in Fig. 1, consists mainly of a power stage, a voltage 
controller, a feedforward controller, a current reference 
generator, a current controller, a PWM switching scheme, and 
zero-voltage and zero-current switching signal generators. The 
power stage can be divided into two sections. The first section 
is a conventional single-phase hard-switching active power 
filter, comprising switches S1, S2, S3, and S4, their body diodes 
D1, D2, D3, and D4, an input boost inductor Lf and a dc capacitor
Co. The second section is the proposed simple ZVS-PWM 
commutation cell, comprised of S5, S6, Lr, Cr1, Cr2, Cr3, and 
Cr4. This commutation cell is synchronous with the circuit of 
the first section and provides the ZVS on all main switches in 
the proposed SSAPF. The generation of switching signals for 
the main and auxiliary switches of the proposed SSAPF is 
illustrated in Fig. 1(b). 
The control strategy for the proposed SSAPF uses multiple-
loop control. The first loop is the current control loop. A 
synchronous sinusoidal signal can be obtained from the source 
voltage signal. The sinusoidal signal is then multiplied by the 
current magnitude signal generated from the outer voltage 
control loop to produce the desired reference line current is
*
.
The reference compensation current if
*
 is obtained by 
subtracting the load current iL from the reference line current is
*
.
Then, the compensation current if is forced to follow the 
reference compensation current if
*
 by a SPWM current 
controller. Next, consider the voltage control loop, which 
basically consists of a feedback controller and a 
feedforward controller. From Fig. 1(b), one can see that 
the capacitor voltage error is fed to the voltage controller 
to provide a partial contribution to the current magnitude 
reference. For the feedforward controller, one can see 
from Fig. 1(b) that the reference capacitor voltage vdc
*
and
the actual capacitor voltage vdc are applied simultaneously 
to the feedforward compensator, providing the 
feedforward signal to improve the transient performance of 
the proposed SSAPF. 
B. Operation Modes 
To simplify the analysis, the following assumptions are 
made during one switching cycle: (i) input boost inductor Lf is
sufficiently large that the compensation current can be 
considered to be ripple-free, if=If; (ii) the dc capacitor Ĉ is 
large enough that the capacitor voltage can be assumed to be 
constant, vdc=Vdc; (iii) all values of resonant capacitors are 
identical, i.e., Cr1=Cr2=Cr3=Cr4ŁCr, where Cr is the sum of the 
parasitic capacitance of MOSFET; and (iv) all components and 
devices are ideal. On the basis of these assumptions, the circuit 
operations in one switching cycle can be divided into eight 
modes. The eight dynamic equivalent circuits are shown in Fig.

shown in Fig. 3. 
Mode 0 (t < t0): Initially, assume that switches S1 and S2 areʳ
turned on, switches S3 and S4 are turned off, and diodes D1 and 
D2 are conducting the compensation current If, and that the 
initial conditions are the resonant voltages vcr1(t)=vcr2(t)=0 and 
the resonant voltages vcr3(t)=vcr4(t)=Vdc. Auxiliary switches S5
and S6 are turned off and the resonant current iLr(t)=0, as shown 
in Fig. 2(a). The resonant current and capacitor voltages can be

Mode 1 (t0 < t < t1): As shown in Fig. 2(b), this mode 
begins when S5 is turned on with ZCS at t = t0. The resonant 
inductor Lr charges linearly from the dc voltage Vdc. The 
resonant current iLr(t) is increased linearly. This mode ends 
when switches S1 and S2 are turned off with ZVS at t=t1. The

form a resonant tank. The resonant current iLr(t) first increases 
and then decreases when it reaches its peak value. This mode

III. DESIGN OF PROPOSED SOFT-SWITCHING ACTIVE POWER 
FILTER
A. Design of  Reactor Inductance on the AC Side 
Under certain conditions, the current-forced control 
technique may not be able to guarantee successful tracking of 
the reference compensation current. This problem exists not 
only in the proposed SSAPF but also in the hard-switching full-
bridge configuration. Hence, a critical value for the reactor 
inductance on the ac side, for successful current tracking, is 
derived in this section.  
The generation of the maximum compensation current is 
limited by the di/dt capability of the circuit. Under the situation 
when the supply voltage is at the maximum,  
f dc m
f
di v V
dt L
−
= (27) 
reaches the minimum. For a compensation current, 
sin( )f mi I n tω=  (28) 
the maximum rate of increase of the current is 
max( )
f
m
di
n I
dt
ω=  (29) 
The value of max(dif /dt) in (29) should be less than the 
upper bound given in (27). Therefore, the design constraint 
becomes 
dc m
f
m
v V
L
n Iω
−
<  (30) 
B. Design of Capacitor on the DC Side 
As far as the design of the DC capacitor is concerned, 
the following conditions must be satisfied. 
1) Due to the high-frequency components of the modulated 
DC current, the voltage ripple must remain within suitable 
limits. 
 2) The capacitor energy must be able to sustain the output 
power demand during the delay time of the voltage control 
loop. 
The first condition is less critical than the second one, 
which determines the capacitor size in practice. 
Given the response time Tr of the voltage control loop and 
the maximum expected variation of the load power ǻPm, the 
energy ǻW exchanged by the DC capacitor can be expressed as

where vdc
* is the reference capacitor voltage, vdc is the 
actual capacitor voltage and ǻp is the variation of 
capacitor power. 
If vdc
*  ǻvdc (note that vdc = vdc*-ǻvdc), 2dcv becomes 
nearly equal to (vdc

C. Design of Resonant Inductor 
To achieve soft commutation at zero-voltage-switching for 
the main switches, the stored energy in the resonant inductor 
needs to be large enough to charge and discharge the resonant 
capacitors. The following inequalities should be satisfied: 
1 ,max

intervals and they must not be larger than Dmin TS or (1-Dmax)
TS, where Dmin and Dmax are minimum and maximum duty 
ratio, respectively.  
In the proposed circuit, the time intervals T1 and T5 are 
selected as T1= T5. From (34) and (35), the resonant inductor 
Lr can be obtained as

Abstract—A novel power converter configuration of a three-
phase soft-switching rectifier comprising four main switches and 
four auxiliary switches is proposed in this paper. The reduction 
in number of main switches can also increase the reliability 
because the control circuits and the auxiliary circuits are thereby 
reduced to two sets. All main switches in the proposed rectifier 
operate at zero voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on, while the 
auxiliary switches operate at zero current switching (ZCS) turn-
off. Moreover, the proposed rectifier achieves a near unity power 
factor, sinusoidal input currents, a regulated output voltage and a 
bidirectional power flow capability. Finally, a small-signal model 
is derived and a feed-forward control is presented to achieve 
almost zero output impedance and zero audio susceptibility. 
Some experimental results of the proposed soft-switching 
rectifier, rated 400 W and operated at 40 kHz, are presented for 
verification.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Three-phase pulse-width-modulated (PWM) rectifiers have 
been increasingly used in many applications: bidirectional 
battery energy storage systems, double converter for ac motor 
drives, and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems [1]-
[2]. Owing to switching losses and limitations of the currently 
available semiconductor devices, the switching frequency of 
hard-switching PWM converters is usually around a few 
kilohertz. Although both power density and transient response 
are improved with higher switching frequencies, high- 
frequency power conversion causes problems such as increase 
in switching stresses on the power devices, increase in 
switching losses, and generation of electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) due to a high dv/dt for high-frequency 
switching operations. 
 To improve the performance of the hard-switching PWM 
converter, a number of soft-switching converters have been 
proposed [3]-[6]. According to the placement of the auxiliary 
circuit, soft-switching converters can be divided into two 
categories: resonant DC link converters (RDCLCs) [1]-[3] and 
resonant pole converters (RPCs) [4]-[6]. In RDCLCs, its circuit 
composition is simple and can be easily understood, but their 
major drawback has been the high voltage or current stress. 
Moreover, RDCLCs require the main switches to operate 
synchronously, making it more difficult to apply the traditional 
sinusoidal pulse-width-modulation (SPWM) technique. RPCs, 
on the other hand, do not suffer from these drawbacks [4]. A 
typical RPC is an auxiliary resonant commutated pole (ARCP) 
converter [4]-[6]. Conventional ARCP converters overcome the 
voltage overshoot problem. However, the existing 
configurations still require six main switches and six auxiliary 
switches. Another problem of such converters with unity power 
factor is the poor dynamic voltage regulation, because of the 
bulk capacitor reducing the ripple voltage and the small 
bandwidth of the voltage regulator for keeping the input current 
sinusoidal. As a result, the voltage dip may be too large when 
the load or/and the line voltage is abruptly changed. 
The novel three-phase soft-switching rectifier presented 
here differs from the traditional ones in the following ways. 
First of all, the number of main switches and auxiliary switches 
are reduced. Decreasing the number of switches is important 
because cost reduction has always been a prime objective 
pursued by the industry. Reduction in number of switches can 
also increase the reliability because the control circuits are 
thereby reduced to two sets. Moreover, in the proposed 
rectifier, all main switches are turned on with ZVS. The 
auxiliary switches operate at ZCS turn-off. In addition to the 
feedback control, a simple feedforward compensator is 
proposed to achieve almost zero output impedance and zero 
audio susceptibility characteristics.

Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the proposed control 
strategy for achieving zero output impedance and zero audio 
susceptibility. Moreover, to be as simple as possible, a simple 
proportional control is chosen for the feedforward controller, 
and a simple PI control is chosen for the feedback controller 
(Gc(s)). It follows from Fig. 4 that one can obtain

Thus, from (51), it can be seen that due to addition of the 
proposed feedforward control, the influence of the line voltage 
variation and the output current variation can now be 
eliminated. In addition, from (48) and (49) it can be seen that Fi
and Fv are independent of all circuit parameters. 
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To confirm the feasibility and performance of the 
proposed three-phase soft-switching rectifier, a hardware 
prototype was constructed with the following parameters: 
1) Output voltage: vo = 200 V.
2) Input boost inductors: L = 5.5 mH.
3) Resonant inductors: Lra = Lrb = 17 Hμ .
4) Output capacitors: C1 = C2 = 1800 Fμ .
5) Rated output power: Po = 400 W.
6)    Switching frequency: fs = 40 kHz.
Figures 5 and 6 show the commutation phenomenon for the 
main switches (S1, S2, S3 and S4) and the auxiliary switchesʳ(Sa1, 
Sa2, Sb1 and Sb2), respectively. The experimental results shown 
in Fig. 5 demonstrate that ZVS is achieved at constant 
frequency for the mainʳ switches (S1, S2, S3 andʳ S4), while the 
experimental results shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate that ZCS is 
achieved at constant frequency for the auxiliary switches (Sa1, 
Sa2, Sb1 and Sb2).ʳ Hence, the switching loss for the proposed 
rectifier is significantlyʳ reduced. At full load, the efficiency 
obtained with the soft-switching rectifier is 2.96% higher than 
its hard-switching counterpart. Figure 7(a) shows the a-phase 
experimental waveforms va and ia. The line current ia is indeed 
in phase with the line voltage va and with a clear sinusoidal 
waveform. Figure 7(b) shows the frequency spectrum of i
a
. The 
total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line current is 4.17% 
and the power factor is 0.97. Figure 8(a) shows three-phase line 
current waveforms. As can be seen, the three-phase line 
currents are balanced and lowly distorted sinusoidal waveforms. 
Figure 8(b) shows the transient responses of the a-phase line 
voltage va, line current ia, output dc voltage vo, and output dc 
current io under a step load change from 0W to 300W. From 
Fig. 8(b), one can find that the proposed rectifier has good 
transient performance.
