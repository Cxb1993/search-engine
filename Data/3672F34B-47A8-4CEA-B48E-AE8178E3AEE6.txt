2cochannel interferers. The emphasis is on obtaining
closed-form expressions. Whereas publications in the
area dealt with SIMO, applications in more recent years
have become increasingly sophisticated, thereby relying
on the more general multiple-input/multiple output
(MIMO) antenna systems which promise significant
increases in system performance and capacity. With no
CCI, the performance of MIMO systems based on
Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) in a Rayleigh
fading channel was studied in [12]-[14]. In the presence
of CCI, the outage performances based on Maximum
Ratio Transmission (MRT) [15] and Optimum
Transmission (OT) [16][17] were studied. In general,
the analysis of above SIMO and MIMO systems adopt
the following assumptions: 1) The number of interferers
exceeds the number of antenna elements, and the
antenna array is unable to cancel every interfering signal
[5][6][17]. At this point, the interference is
approximated by Gaussian noise. 2) The phase of each
interferer relative to the desired signal for each diversity
branch is neglected, and thus phase tracking and symbol
synchronization are not only perfect for the desired
signal, but also for CCI [3]-[17]. 3) Average powers of
interferers are assumed to be equal, which is valid in the
case these interferers are approximately at the same
distance from the receiver [3]-[5][17]. 4) The effect of
thermal noise is neglected, which is reasonable for
interference limited systems [5][7][8][17]. Based on the
above assumptions, the SINR distribution is derived and
enables analytical computation of performance
measures such as outage probability and average error
probability.
The noise approximation model is simplistic, but
was shown to be inaccurate for the case of a few
dominant interferers. Moreover, all of the early work
mentioned above did not consider pulse waveform and
the modulation characteristics of the signal of interest,
as well as CCI. Therefore, the effects of ISI produced by
CCI due to symbol timing were neglected. In [9][10],
the bit error rate (BER) of PSK operating in several
different flat fading environments in the presence of
CCI was analyzed using the precise cochannel
interference model. The performances of dual-branch
equal gain combining (EGC) and dual-branch selection
combining (SC) were investigated by them. However,
the performances of MIMO systems using MRT and OT
schemes have not been studied to the best of our
knowledge. We study the exact average BER of OT and
provides the comparison with MRT using the precise
cochannel interference model when the desired signal
and interference are subject to nonfading and Rayleigh
fading. With the multiple ISI-like CCI sources, the
simulation is expected to be very tedious and time-
exhausting in MIMO systems. Therefore, we estimate
the error probability for each fading channel fast and
accurately using Gauss quadrature rules (GQR).
System Models
We consider a MIMO system equipped with
antenna elements at the transmitter and antenna
elements at the receiver as shown in Fig. 1. It is assumed
that there exist totally L cochannel interferers from the
neighboring cells. The system is modeled assuming that
desired signal and cochannel sources transmitting QAM
signal over a flat fading channel. The transmitted QAM
baseband signal from the desired signal can be
expressed in the form
(1)
where represents the transmit weight on the kth
antenna ( ). Since the CCI transmit weights
are not controlled by the desired receiver, the transmit
weights of CCI can be neglected. Thus, the ith transmit
cochannel interference can be combined as
(2)
where is the sequence of complex
data symbols and is the symbol interval. The data
symbols and on the in-phase and quadrature
paths define the signal constellation of the QAM signal
with points. In the constellation, we take
. The transmitter
filter gives a pulse having the square-root raised-
cosine spectrum with a rolloff factor. The desired signal
is indexed by , and the CCI sources by
( for CCI).
The channel is spatially independent flat Rayleigh
fading. The complex channel gain between the kth

Therefore, the maximum SINR can be achieved when

Error Probability Estimation
To complete this, we begin by the combined signal
in Eq. (7) as
(13)
where which is equal to is the largest
eigenvalue of the matrix for MRT and for
OT. With defining , the combined ISI
in the in-phase rail due to total CCI can be denoted by
(14)
The mth weighted discrete-time noise is expressed as
. The power spectra of the filtered noise
is and hence resulting in the
output power (variance) ,
where has a raised cosine spectral characteristic.
Since the noise is uncorrelated between diversity
branches, the variance of the combined output noise,
, is expressed as
. (15)
We define where and have
equal power (variance), . Since the
distribution density functions of quantities and are
symmetric to zero and are identical, it has been shown
that the average symbol error probability can be
bounded tightly by
. (16)
Because is a random variable whose distribution is
not known explicitly, the evaluation of is
performed by computing the conditional error
probability of each of all possible sequences of CCI, and
then averaging over all those sequences [18][19].
Using the Gaussian quadrature rule, the averaging
operation in (16) can be approximated by
, (17)
a linear combination of values of the function ,
where denotes the probability function of the
random variable with range . The weights (or
coefficients) , and the abscissas , can
be calculated from the knowledge of the first
moments of . A recursive algorithm which can be used
to determine the moments of all order of was
discussed in [18]. We compute the average in (17) by
means of the classic GQR’s suggested in [18] [19].
We only exhibit the simulation results of 4-QAM
with the rolloff factor . The performance is
evaluated by using the quasi-analytical technique (QA)
for fading cases. Average error rate due to fading can be
evaluated by averaging the error rate over all possible
varying channel parameters. A single dominant CCI and
six strongest interferers are considered individually. The
average bit error rate (BER) for 4-QAM.
When all channels are unfaded, but the random
carrier phase and symbol timing offsets of CCI in the
precise CCI model. It is observed that the results
obtained by using precise interference model are
considerably better than that obtained by using the
Gaussian model. Those curves appear different for L =
1, but they become close when L = 6. Based on a central
limit theorem, by increasing the number of interference
and number of receiver antennas, the Gaussian CCI
model can approach to the precise CCI model. Unlike
the Gaussian CCI case, we can see that using the precise
CCI model results in slightly better performance when T
> R, for example (T, R) = (3, 2), (T, R) = (2, 1) and (T, R)
= (3, 1), when L = 1. This is attributed to the fact that
more interfering signals received by antennas can
approach to Gaussian distributed CCI which causes a
higher degradation. In theory, neglecting the phase of
the channel results in a lowest BER with (T, R) = (2, 2).
Note that the average BER with (T, R) = (2, 2) is the
highest, particularly for the case of L = 6, since the
received signal power may be degraded by the variation
phase of the channel. However, decreasing the value of
SIR to 5dB, the performance with (T, R) = (2, 2)
becomes the best. When both the desired signal and
CCI are subject to fading, the average BER becomes
very high due to the fading effect on the desired signal.
The high average irreducible error floor is due to the fact
that fading effects increase the chance of taking on a
lower instantaneous SIR. The curves of the Gaussian
CCI and the precise CCI appear different with the
increase of the transmitter and receiver antenna
elements, since the fading effect of the desired signal is
reduced and then results in a similar behavior to the
nonfading case. Note that the performance with L = 6
becomes better than that with L = 1 for this fading CCI
case.
We consider the OT scheme and compare its
results with the MRT scheme in MIMO systems. The
number of receiver antennas must be greater than two in
order to cancel CCI. For the nonfading case, Fig. 2
shows that the performance is worse than MRT at R = 2
for L = 1 due to significant noise enhancement under
certain channel conditions (phase offset for each
diversity branch) of CCI, when the MIMO intends to
cancel CCI. In this case, the two channels are very
similar, leading to severe noise amplification. We find
that OT with two receiver antennas is unable to show the
superiority over MRT for higher value of SIR (e.g. SIR
> 7dB), particularly when T > 1. Interference
cancellation can compensate for noise enhancement
effect at low SIR. The use of R = 3 can avoid this worse
CCI situation and then improve the raised curve of BER,
as shown in Fig. 3. In fact, the maximum SINR is unable
to guarantee the minimum BER, if the interference is not

6worse than that with T = 1, R = 3 in the case of L = 1 due
to noise enhancement. However, the performance with T
= 2, R = 2 is still better in the case of L = 6, since CCI
cannot be eliminated and has a similar behavior to the
MRT case. Similary, the performance of the case (T = 3,
R = 2) is worse than the case (T = 2, R = 3). Note that the
performance of OT is worse than MRT in the case (T =
3, R = 2) when SNR < 20dB since the noise
enhancement effect cannot compensate for the gain of
CCI interference cancellation. The OT scheme has a
similar behavior to the MRT scheme for L = 6, having
an error floor because L > T + R. The results are similar
to that presented in [17], which shows that the OT
scheme with T = 5, R = 1 (or T = 4, R = 2) is always
worse than the one with (T = 1, R = 5 (or T = 2, R = 4)
for L = 6 in a Rayleigh-Rayleigh fading channel in
absence of noise, assuming that L > T + R. Similar to the
MRT case, it is preferable to distribute the number of
antenna elements evenly between the transmitter and the
receiver for an optimum performance using MRT and
OT when L = 6 (e.g., T = 3, R = 3 and T = 2, R = 2).
Usually, it is difficult to generalize the
performance of the OT scheme with reference to the
MRT scheme in all MIMO cases, depending on the
combination of the antennas at the transmitter and the
receiver, number of interference and the statical
characteristics of the channel. The results of this study
are expected to lead to a better understanding of the
effects of interference, and then to optimize spectrum
reuse and coverage in MIMO systems. The use of
precise CCI model provides significant improvement in
the performance analysis and comparison. To the
author’s knowledge, the precise analysis of OT and
comparison with MRT was not investigated. The
simulation results show that the Gaussian interference
model will become inaccurate for high order of antennas
in the MRT based MIMO system when the desired
signal and CCI suffer Rayleigh fading. Moreover, the
optimal technique using OT can offer performance gain
at high SNR when the number of interferers is smaller,
particularly for the case with high order of receive
antennas under the fading condition; however, the
performation is degraded by noise enhancement when T
> R. Hence, it is preferable to distribute the more
number of antenna elements to the receiver for an
optimum performance using OT given a fixed number
of total antennas, unlike the MRT case and multiple
interference case. The OT scheme, in general, does not
provide significant performance improvement over the
MRT scheme when the number of interferers is large,
particularly when the number of transmit antennas is
smaller than the number of receive antennas.
