1 Introduction
We consider a MTO inventory system that
the system starts to produce a new item
whenever one demand arrives and this
demand will take away an item (end-product)
if there is any, otherwise, it will wait for the
end-product. In order to satisfy with the
random demand, we may put some initial
inventory in the warehouse. We call such
system an inventory queueing system. In such a
system, demands for items arrives one-at-a-time at
the system, and each demand triggers an order for
a new item to be produced in the production
station. In this system, we assume that the
amount of the raw material for producing item
is infinite and the production station is
processed under a first-in-first-out disciple.
When the order for producing an item is
fulfilled, the corresponding end-product will
be put in the end production inventory. When a
demand arrives at the system, if there is at least
one end production in the inventory, the demand
will be satisfied immediately; otherwise, it
will wait for the product in the demands queue
on the first-in-first-out basis and will be
satisfied with future production output.
According to the descriptions above, the
inventory-queue system can be decomposed
into two subsystems which are production and
inventory system. The production system
includes both the order queue and the
workstation, and the inventory system
includes both the end-production inventory
and a demand queue. The illustration of this
system is shown in Figure 1.1
Figure 1.1: The Inventory-Queueing System
In the assembly system, a variety of
products are assembled to order from
components and sub-assemblies. We consider
a queueing system that the model parallel
devices are called fork-join queueing system.
The fork-join queueing system is used to
describe the dynamic behavior of a variety of
actual complex manufacturing systems and
assembly lines like refrigeration plants,
aerospace industry, telecommunications, etc.
The illustration of the fork-join queueing
system with two-node is shown in Figure 1.2.

2. Waiting time of the order in a inventory
system with a two-node FJ queueing
assembly system
In this section, we develop the waiting time
of the order in the fork-join queueing system
with two nodes based on Lindley’s equation

3. The response time of the demand in an
inventory queueing system
In this section, we analyze the
inventory-queue system. When the nth
demand arrives, if there are products in the
inventory, the demand will be satisfied
immediately; otherwise it will wait for the
product in the demands queue on the
first-in-first-out basis. In either case, the
corresponding production order, called the nth
order, will enter the production system
concurrently.
Note that in an inventory queueing system
with bases stock s, the end-product taken
away by demand (n + s + 1) is the made by
order (n + 1) is given by (3.1). Let nV be the
service time of the nth order, n be the time
epoch that the nth order starts to process and
'
n
 be the time epoch that the nth order
finishes processing. Also note that, nA +
q
nW
is the time epoch that the nth order starts to
process, n, it is also the time epoch that the
(n − 1)st order finishes processing,. We have
the following lemmas

In Theorem 1, we obtain the Lindley type
equation describing the dynamics of the
system. It will be the basis for the further
analysis on the system.
4. Numerical Analysis
From the section 3 we can consider the
Lindley’s equation mentioned above. we
simulate the expected waiting time of the
order based on 1000 samples. To show the
accuracy of our simulation for expected
waiting time of the order. The system

Typical numerical examples are shown in
Table 4.1, where the arrival rate is  = 1
(note that by assumption 1 2  ), and three
experiments varying the service rate of the
second server as follow

column of table contains our simulated
expected waiting time (denoted by Sim.).
