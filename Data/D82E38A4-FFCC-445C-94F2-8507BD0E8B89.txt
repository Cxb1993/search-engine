Abstract. As miniaturization of product 
becomes a trend, meso-machining technique for 
relevant components becomes necessary. Micro- 
milling with small size cutter is one of the key 
techniques for meso-manufacturing. When size 
of tool becomes small, feasible range of process 
parameter becomes limited. Without properly 
selected parameter, it could result in cost 
increase and quality unacceptable. Optimization 
of micro-milling to maximize removal rate and 
tool life is an important issue. This study aims at 
developing an optimization module using 
genetic algorithm for micro-milling. A milling 
experiment for constructing a prediction model 
of tool life was conducted. A computer program 
based on Pareto genetic algorithm was coded to 
search for optimized solution. A set of 
non-dominated solution satisfying dual 
objectives was obtained as the result. The 
solution can be used for determining milling 
parameter based on process interest. 
 
1. Introduction 
As minimization of precision product became 
a trend, demand for producing components with 
micro-meso feature has increased tremendously. 
Micro milling process uses micro-cutter to 
generate mini-part of 3D surface with tight 
tolerance and high precision. With equipment of 
lower cost and broader machining range than 
other micro-machining process, micro-milling 
becomes a better choice for meso-manufacturing. 
Friendrich et al [1] pointed out that 
micro-milling is for 3D mini-element, which can 
effectively perform micro removal. 
During milling, micro-cutter wears due to 
generated force, such that tool geometry 
deteriorates and machining accuracy affected. 
Tool wear is in the form of crater and flank wear, 
 4
non-dominated solution. The set of 
non-dominated solutions is in Pareto-front, as in 
Fig. 1. It indicates that non-dominated set is the 
solution with the least conflict of different 
objective and provides a better choice for 
decision maker. 
For specie without enough fitness was 
eliminated using niched method. The method 
was proposed by Horn et al [10] in 1994 as a 
pre-selection mechanism, which is described 
next. If C represents the second generation while 
P the first one. When fitness of C is better than 
that of P, P was substituted by C and inherited 
into subsequent generation, otherwise P is still 
retained. Since C and P have similar coding 
structure, the substitution maintains versatility 
of population and creates a niche environment to 
randomly mate among parental generation. 
Suppose there are N species in parental 
generation and mated to N/2 species. Each pair 
of parental specie is operated with crossover and 
mutation to generate 2 new species to compete 
with their parent to retain the one with better 
fitness. This algorithm generates solution with 
wider spectrum and shorter converging time.

4. Micro-milling Experiment 
A milling experiment was conducted for 
constructing tool life model of micro-milling. 
The objective is to obtain tool life data from 
groove milling under different condition for 
machined roughness better than 0.2μm. The 
machine tool for the test was a desktop four axis 
ultra-precision milling machine (TRIDER-X). 
The CBN cutter of 0.5mm diameter was ball-nose 
type with two flutes. The specimen was mold 
material SKD11 (100×40×10 mm) with surface 
hardness 60 HRC and surface error before the 
test within 2μm. The test variable includes feed 
rate (vw, in mm/min) and depth of cut (ap, in μm). 
The spindle speed was set to 30000 rpm and test 
conditions shown in Table 1. During the test, 
milling force in three directions (Fx, Fy, and Fz) 
was sampled by a force dynamometer at every 
40 mm of cut. The force data was acquired via a 
computer data acquisition system at 30 kHz 
sampling rate and low-pass filtered at 10 kHz. 
The sampled forces were transformed into 
tangential (Ft) and normal components (Fn). As 
the force sampling finished, the cutter was 
unloaded to measure tool flank wear (VB) and 
reloaded afterward to continue. The process 
repeats until the preset removal volume was 
reached.

9 60 1080 
 
5. Experimental Result and the Prediction 
Model 
As the test completed, the result was plotted 
against accumulated material removal, as in Fig. 
2 (only two examples from the result). It can be 
observed that three curves in each figure all 
show initially low value and a moderate increase 
afterward. For some cases, deflection point of 
curve may be seen after the increase to suggest 
an accelerated tool worn out. Since the purpose 
 6
(R2) of the statistical testing was found to be 
99%. 
The test was run and data collected.  The 
recorded ground roughness was plotted against 
the accumulated material removal, as in Fig. 3.  
It can be seen that the ground roughness tends to 
increase to a high value at around 10000 mm3 of 
removal volume and starts to scatter afterward. 
The roughness was not further increased 
prominently, which suggests the variability of 
the grain sharpness during grinding has reached 
a near stable condition such that the ground 
roughness only shows a scattered situation along 
the process. 
 
6. Process Optimization of Micro-Milling 
As the prediction model was obtained, the 
optimization program was activated to search 
for optimization. Since the model has taken tool 
wear and machined roughness into account, the 
optimization strategy did not consider the effects, 
which is 
To: Maximize MRR (ap × vw) and Teff  
Subject to: 30 ≦ ap ≦ 60 (μm) 
840 ≦ vw ≦ 1080 (mm/min) 
MRR is removal rate per width of cut. The 
process of optimization is described next. The 
solution space was first initialized with 
randomly generated condition. In this study, real 
value was used instead of binary string. The 
fitness function considered simultaneously 
removal rate and tool life. The chromosome 
selected with Roulette wheel algorithm [9] and 
the genes from arithmetic crossover were fed 
into fitness test to produce new generation. The 
process repeats until the preset number of 
generation. The program parameter is: 
population size 500, 160 for offspring, total 
number of generation 500, and rate of crossover 
0.8. The program was terminated when both 
objectives converged after 150th generations. Set 
of non-dominated solution (10 solutions) were 
obtained and listed in Table 4, which was also 
plotted for dual objectives in Fig. 4. As can be 
seen, most of the solution suggests high depth of 
cut. This might be due to the behavior of tool 
life.

討會，來自國內的學者較為少數，僅有成大、台北科大、南開、台中技術學院、本校學
者等約八餘人，尚可謂群聚一堂。在最後一天的學者結束發表後，眾人紛紛返回國內，
於是熱鬧的場面終告一個段落。 
本次研討會，由於事前大會以將所參加之論文，完成同儕審查(Peer Review)，因此
將直接交付先進材料研究期刊 (Advanced Materials Research Journal (ISSN: 
1022-6680))，以特刊(Special Issue)之形式直接出刊。由於該期刊目前正因稿擠，未能直
接完成付印。大會原本計畫以特刊作為大會論本集，因此，此次研討會在會議結束前均
未能提供與會者任何其他報告者的論文資料，可說是研討會的一大敗筆。但大會允若，
將在完成期刊印製後逕寄所有與會學者。
