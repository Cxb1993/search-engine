Abstract
This report presents the study results on the capability of phase control for the
oscillator arrays with two coupling mechanisms, injection locking and phase-locked
loop. Chapter 2 describes the basic principles and formulations of these two kinds
of oscillator arrays. Being able to regulate the phase relation of the oscillator array,
two applications in electronically scanned arrays are discussed in Chapter 3 and
Chapter 4. Both the theory and the experiments are studied.
Chapter 3 presents analysis and experimental results of a beam-steering antenna
array using an injection locked coupled oscillator array with self-tuning of oscillator
free-running frequencies. With the use of coupled type-II phase locked loops for tun-
ing oscillator free-running frequencies and an external injection signal for stabilizing
the array operating frequency, this antenna array can steer its main-beam through a
single control voltage and hold its output frequency at the injection signal frequency
in operation. Besides, its beam-pointing error arising from phase errors in coupled
oscillators can be reduced and the array works well over a certain frequency band.
Phase dynamics and stability are studied and experimentally verified. Experimental
results of a three-element injection locked coupled oscillator array show that its uni-
form phase progression ranges between −16◦ and 52◦ and the phase errors are less
than 5◦ at 2.7GHz. The operation bandwidth is shown from 2.68GHz to 2.72GHz.
Loading this oscillator array with rectangular patch antennas, the beam-steering
radiation characteristics are measured at various control voltages.
In Chapter 4, analysis and experimental results of a beam-steering and -switching

Introduction
1.1 Research Motivation
Today, the world has witnessed the rapid extension of research and development on
wireless communications and radar systems. To meet this demand, radio-frequency
(RF) circuit should have compact size, low cost, high efficiency, and high integrity.
With the maturity of the semiconductor industry, active antennas [1–4] draw more
and more attention, which integrate passive antennas and active circuits.
Coupled oscillators have some fascinating features. The capability of phase con-
trol is the most attracting. Many researchers devote themselves to this topic and
find various methods to analyze and control the phase distribution in coupled os-
cillators [5–29]. Being able to control the phase distribution, oscillator arrays can
provide higher output power than individuals. Thus, coupled oscillators have the po-
tential for active antennas. This report presents the useful methods of phase control
for coupled oscillators through two types of coupling mechanisms, injection locking
and phase-locked loop (PLL), and their applications in electronically scanned arrays
(ESAs).

can use an electronic method instead of a mechanical method to steer their main-
beams. This increases the speed of beam scanning strikingly. This kind of antenna
arrays is widely known as a phased array [33]. Moreover, planar phased arrays are
less bulky as compared with similar reflector antennas. Figure 1.1 illustrates a con-
ventional phased array. The phased array uses a feed network, phase shifters, and
control signals to provide the desired phase distribution. However, these components
are large, heavy, and lossy.
Oscillator arrays provide an alternative approach to implement a phased array
[8–10,12,17,21,22,25,28]. The common and promising feature of these techniques is
that they can eliminate phase shifters and, in certain cases, distribution networks of
3
oscillators. Thus, this array has a constant progressive phase relation. This approach
is known as inter-injection locking. Another one is edge de-tuning [9–11,15, 25, 28],
which changes the free-running frequencies of the edge oscillators in the opposite
directions. In theory, this approach needs to tune the periphery oscillators only.
However, one apparent drawback of coupled oscillators is the limited range of
phase progressions. This can be overcome by introducing a frequency multiplier
following each oscillator [36].
Two-dimensional beam-scanning antenna arrays using mutually coupled oscilla-
tors were studied [37, 38]. The approach of phase control is edge de-tuning similar
to that in the one-dimensional case.
1.3 Contribution
This report presents the methods of phase control for coupled oscillators through
two kinds of coupling mechanisms, injection locking and PLL, and their applications
in ESAs.
The precise phase control for a COA and its application in a phased array are
presented in Chapter 3 [39, 40]. With the use of coupled type-II PLLs for tuning
oscillator free-running frequencies and an external injection signal for stabilizing the
array operating frequency, this antenna array can steer its main-beam through a sin-
gle control voltage and hold its output frequency at the injection signal frequency in
operation. In addition, its beam-pointing error arising from phase errors in coupled
oscillators can be reduced and the array works well over a certain frequency band.
Phase dynamics and stability are studied and experimentally verified. Experimental
results are shown to be in agreement with the theory and present the potential for
ESAs.
The precise phase control for a CPLLA and its application in a phased array are
presented in Chapter 4 [41–44]. Using a type-II CPLLA and an external reference
5
experiment.
And the last, Chapter 5 draws some conclusions.

Basic Principles
The Dutch researcher Christiaan Huygens was probably the first scientist who ob-
served and described the synchronization phenomenon in the seventeenth century.
He discovered that a couple of pendulum clocks hanging from a common support
had synchronized, i.e. their oscillations coincided and the pendulums moved al-
ways in opposite directions. Huygens described his observation of synchronization
as follows [46, 47].
... It is quite worth noting that when we suspended two clocks so con-
structed from two hooks imbedded in the same wooden beam, the mo-
tions of each pendulum in opposite swings were so much in agreement
that they never receded the least bit from each other and the sound of
each was always heard simultaneously. Further, if this agreement was
disturbed by some interference, it reestablished itself in a short time. For
a long time I was amazed at this unexpected result, but after a careful
examination finally found that the cause of this is due to the motion
of the beam, even though this is hardly perceptible. The cause is that
the oscillations of the pendula, in proportion to their weight, communi-
cate some motion to the clocks. This motion, impressed on the beam,
necessarily has the effect of making the pendula come to a state of ex-

oscillators: the relaxation oscillator and the harmonic oscillator. The relaxation
oscillator is often used to generate a square or sawtooth wave. This oscillator has a
non-linear component that periodically discharges the energy stored in a capacitor,
causing abrupt changes in the output waveform. The harmonic oscillator produces
a sinusoidal output. This oscillator contains an electronic, non-linear amplifier with
the output applied to a narrow-band filter. The output of the filter is fed back to
the input of the amplifier. When switching on the power supply to the amplifier
first, the output of the amplifier consists only of noise. The noise travels around
the loop, being filtered and re-amplified until it increasingly resembles the desired
rhythm shape.
Electronic oscillators can exhibit rhythms of various shapes, from sinusoidal
waveform to a sequence of pulses. Taking the harmonic oscillator for example,
its rhythm can be quantified. The output signal of the oscillator is periodic (Figure
2.1), which would be the current or voltage. The period T is the main feature of
the oscillator. Often it is convenient to characterize the rhythm by the oscillation

2.2.1 Injection Locking
Integrated circuit technology allows the manufacture of multiple microwave oscilla-
tors on a single chip. Summing the outputs of these oscillators does not necessarily
help in increasing the output power. Indeed, even if the frequencies of these oscilla-
tors are identical, their phases would be different to give destructive responses. The
difference in frequencies will result in a relatively small power when summing the
outputs of these incoherent oscillators. Hence, to obtain high-density output power
these oscillators must not only have a common frequency, but also have close phases,
i.e. they should be synchronous. To implement this, one oscillator can be used as
15
where β = βp/G
3 and α = (αp − G)/G. Since the terms of amplitude and phase
of the oscillator are slowly time-varying function as compared with the period of
oscillation, 2π/ωinj, the output current of the oscillator can be expressed as

I(t)ejωinjt + c.c. (2.12)
where I(t) is the output current phasor of the oscillator. Substituting (2.10) and

where Φ is the coupling phase.
Generally, the frequencies of these two oscillators, ωfr,1 and ωfr,2, are different.
Let ωfr,1 < ωfr,2. If the coupling is sufficiently strong, frequency locking appears as
the mutual adjustment of oscillating frequencies, so that ωcmn =

dt
θ1 =

θ2 where
ωcmn is the common frequency. Then, Φ becomes equal to −ωcmnτp. Typically,

frequency distribution.
Now let us consider the case when the coupling phase Φ is zero. Assuming
identical free-running amplitudes of the oscillators and substituting ∆θi = θi − θi+1
into (2.24b) give
ωfr,i =


ǫ[sin(∆θi)− sin(∆θi−1)] i = 2 · · ·N − 1
ωcmn − ωfr,N2QN ǫ sin(∆θN−1) i = N.
(2.26)
In a phased array, the radiation pattern is steered in a particular direction by making
a constant phase progression along the array, which means ∆θi = ∆θ. Then, (2.26)
becomes
ωfr,i =


ǫ sin(∆θ) i = 1

ωcmn − ωfr,N2QN ǫ sin(∆θ) i = N.
(2.27)
For a linear antenna array using COA, the direction of the main-beam can then
be controlled by setting the central N − 2 oscillators to a common frequency ωcmn
and tuning the free-running frequencies of the two outermost oscillators in opposite
directions.
2.2.2 Phase-Locked Loop
In a PLL we try to synchronize a self-sustained oscillator with an external signal.
Instead of using the external signal as a forcing term as in (2.11), we construct an
additional electronic circuit to change the coefficients in (2.4) or (2.7) in order to
ensure synchronization. The advantage of this approach is that the different aspects
of the phase dynamics can be controlled separately. That is to say, one can make an
electronic circuit that simulates an equation for the phase with the wanted properties
of synchronization.

θ = ωfr +Kvv(t) (2.30)
where Kv is VCO tuning sensitivity. The phase detector (PD) multiplies these two

j(θref +θ) + ej(θref−θ)] + c.c.
= Kpd[e
j(θref +θ) + ej(θref−θ)] + c.c. (2.31)
where Kpd is the PD conversion gain. Then, an ideal low-pass filter (LPF) separates
these two parts of p(t). It suppresses the term in (2.31) that is proportional to
the sum of the instantaneous phases and leaves only the term proportional to the
difference between instantaneous phases. Its output signal can be expressed as
v(t) = Kpde
j(θref−θ) + c.c.
= Kpd cos(θref − θ). (2.32)
Substituting (2.32) into (2.30), one can get the phase dynamic equation [47, 49]
d
dt
θ = ωfr +KvKpd cos(θref − θ). (2.33)
From (2.33), one can know that the frequency of the self-sustained oscillator becomes
equal to the frequency of the reference signal, and a stable relation between phases
is achieved. Besides, one can use the specific PD and LPF to simulate a phase
dynamic equation for the desired properties of synchronization.
Now considering N self-sustained oscillators as shown in Figure 2.3(b) where

where ωcmn is the common frequency. Typically, ωfr,1 < ωcmn < ωfr,2. Frequency
locking implies a certain relation between the phases. This relation depends on the
free-running frequencies and the parameters of the feedback loop.
Now we extend this case to a more complicated situation when N oscillators are
interrelated through PLLs as shown in Figure 2.7. Following the analysis described
above, the phase dynamics of this N -element CPLLA is

θ1 = ωfr,1 −KvKpd cos(θ1 − θ2) (2.36a)

for i = 2 · · ·N − 1. Similarly, the phase distribution of this CPLLA is determined
by the free-running frequencies and the parameters of feedback loops.
Practical applications of oscillator arrays need certain phase relations to be syn-
thesized. Knowing how variations in free-running frequencies and parameters of
feedback loops will affect the array performance is important. Adjusting parame-

Beam-Steering Antenna Array
Using Coupled Oscillator Array
3.1 Motivation
Beam-steering antenna arrays find many applications in microwave radar and com-
munication systems. COA is a prominent technique to offer its output signals with
the required phase distribution to the connected antennas without the use of phase
shifters [1, 9, 12, 13, 17, 21, 50] or with the use of a single phase shifter [8]. The op-
eration of phase distribution control is based on the injection locking mechanism
of oscillators [5–7, 45]. For a linear COA in a phased array, nearest-neighboring
coupling is the most popular structure. A phase distribution with a constant pro-
gression, which means that the difference between the phases of successive elements
is a constant, is often taken into consideration for the output signals. The behavior
of such an array can be expressed by a set of nonlinear differential equations de-
scribed in Chapter 2 [9–11, 16]. In theory, one can set the central oscillators to a

cillators in opposite directions through two control signals to yield a uniform phase

determined approximately by solving [14]

where φ(x, τ) and ωfr(x) are the phase and free-running frequency functions at the
position x. For the i-th oscillator, φ(i, τ) = φi(τ) and ωfr(i) is its free-running
frequency when it is not synchronized. ∆ωlock is the inter-oscillator locking range,
and τ = ∆ωlockt is the time measured in the inverse locking range. V (x)φinj(τ)
represents the external injection signal where V (x) and φinj(τ) give the spatial
distribution of the injection signal and the time dependence of the injection signal
phase, respectively. The boundary conditions at the array ends are the classical
Neumanm conditions independent of time [13, 14].
Translating φ(x, τ) to φ(x, τ)− φinj(τ) in (3.2), one gets

Since φinj(τ) is a constant with respect to x, the last term of the right-hand side of
(3.3) is zero. As the array reaches synchronization, φ(x, τ) − φinj(τ) approaches a
constant with respect to τ but depends on x [14]. Then, (3.3) becomes

[φ(x, τ)− φinj(τ)]− V (x)[φ(x, τ)− φinj(τ)] = −ρ (3.4)
where ρ = Ωfr−Ωinj . Ωfr = ωfr(x)/∆ωlock is the normalized free-running frequency
function, and Ωinj = ωcmn/∆ωlock + ∂φinj(τ)/∂τ is the normalized injection signal
frequency.

phase errors can be reduced to zero through the process described above to decrease
|ρ′| to zero.
In the following of this chapter, we will present the design of an antenna array
using an ILCOA with self-tuning of oscillator free-running frequencies. With the use
of coupled type-II PLLs for tuning the oscillators and an external injection signal
for stabilizing the array operating frequency, the array can steer its main-beam by
a single control voltage and hold its output frequency stably at the frequency of the
injection signal. In addition, its beam-pointing error arising from the phase errors in
coupled oscillators can be reduced and the array works well over a certain frequency
band.
3.2 Theory
3.2.1 Phase Dynamics
Now considering the basic structure of an N -element ILCOA with self-tuning of
oscillator free-running frequencies. Figure 3.2 illustrates its configuration. The
ILCOA consists of N + 1 oscillators. The left-end oscillator represents an external
injection signal, and the others form a COA through a resistive coupling network.

oscillator output signal and injection signal, respectively. ǫ and Φinj are the coupling
strength and phase to account for the resistive coupling network.
Using (3.7) and (3.8) and assuming Cintvar ≫ ∆Cvar , one has

Kpd is the PD conversion gain. The phase shift Φpll is used to determine the PLL
stable equilibrium point. f(t) is the impulse response of the LPF, and ∗ is the
convolution operator. By using (3.7), (3.9), and (3.13), ωpllfr/Q

other one in the maximum is unstable. The stable solution depends on the values
of Φinj and Φpll. Letting Φinj = −2π and Φpll = −π/2, the stable point is
∆θ = sin−1
(
Vctrl
Kpd
)
. (3.22)
By varying Vctrl in (3.22) between its extremes, ∆θ ranges between -90
◦ and 90◦
accordingly.
An graphic representation can briefly explains this theory. Figure 3.3(c) illus-
trates the relation of the injection signal, PLL, admittance locus Yc(ω), and device
line −Yd(A). The intersection point (Apllfr , ωpllfr ) of the loci of Yc(ω) and −Yd(A)
determines the free-running amplitude and frequency under the influence of PLL.
The length of the arrow shown in Figure 3.3(c) is proportional to the amplitude
of the injection signal and corresponds to the distance between the device line and
admittance locus. Since the PLL output signal controls the the capacitance of the
varactor, Yc(ω) and the consequent ω
pll
fr can be adjusted. The phase difference be-
tween the oscillator signal and injection signal is then determined accordingly. When
the oscillator is synchronized, the PLL tunes ωpllfr to make the phase difference be
equal to sin−1(Vctrl/Kpd) through the loop filter of the inverting integrator. Simi-
larly, the value of the uniform phase progression is determined based on the same
approach in an N -element ILCOA integrated with coupled type-II PLLs.
Now comparing the above approach with the method having an oscillator inte-
grated with a type-I PLL [25], the phase difference is
∆θ = sin−1
(
Vtune + Vctrl
Kpd
)
(3.23)
where Kpd is the PD conversion gain. The voltage Vtune tunes the oscillator to make
its free-running frequency be equal to the reference signal frequency. The control
voltage Vctrl then determines the phase difference. From (3.22) and (3.23), one can
find that even if the oscillator intrinsic free-running frequency deviates from the
37
and
Kpd cos(∆θN−1 + Φpll)− Vctrl = 0 (3.28)
for i = 1, . . . , N − 1 at that time. In other words,
|∆θ0 + Φpll| = |∆θ1 + Φpll| = . . . = |∆θN−1 + Φpll| = cos−1
(
Vctrl
Kpd
)
. (3.29)
Therefore, the circuit shown in Figure 3.2 has 2N possible phase distributions. Let-
ting Φinj = −2π and Φpll = −π/2, the stable mode of (3.24) is
∆θ0 = ∆θ1 = . . . = ∆θN−1 = sin
−1
(
Vctrl
Kpd
)
, (3.30)
which is the uniform progressive phase distribution. Note Vctrl is the only control
voltage applied to determine the phase progression value, while there are two control
voltages needed for a conventional COA without using PLL circuits to control the
value of the uniform phase progression. From (3.24) and (3.30), the developed
oscillator array shows that it can accurately and conveniently provide its output
signals with a uniform progressive phase distribution. The phase difference is an
inverse sine function of Vctrl/Kpd in spite of the fluctuations described above. In
addition, the array can hold its output frequency stably at the frequency of the
injection signal in operation. Moreover, the proposed array can work well as the
injection signal frequency is varied within the injection signal locking range for
multi-frequency operation.
3.2.2 Stability Analysis
The behavior of coupled oscillators depends on the coupling network. Recent studies
have accurately predicted the performance of coupled oscillators for not only weak
and strong coupling but also narrow-band and broadband coupling networks [10,20,
21, 27, 53]. From (3.29) one can see that when the array reaches synchronization,

δ∆θi = δθi − δθi+1 (3.33)
and using (3.17), (3.31) then is expressed as

small perturbation if the perturbation dies out with time. That is all the eigenvalues
of A for this forced system must have negative real parts [10, 21, 54]. With Φinj =
−2π, Φpll = −π/2, Kv = 11MHz/V, Kpd = 0.72V, ǫωintfr /2Q = 532.8Mrad/sec,
R = 1KΩ, and C = 22uF, the eigenvalues of A for each mode given in (3.29) are
calculated for the developed three-element oscillator array to be described in the
next section. Only the phase distribution with uniform phase progressions meets
the stability requirement and thus is the stable solution of (3.24). The stable range
of phase progression is limited to ±90◦.
Nevertheless, stability depends on phase gradient and the number of array ele-
ments [21]. Furthermore, noises and non-identical array elements are encountered
in practical arrays. Therefore, the measured stable range would be smaller than the
predicted value and stability might not be guaranteed as the number of array ele-
ments increases. Linear stability analysis, however, gives useful information about
circuit parameters for initial design.
3.3 Experimental Verification
In this section, we will present the detailed circuit design of an N -element ILCOA
integrated with coupled type-II PLLs. Measured results of a single-element unit are
described first. And then, the control of the uniform phase progression and reduction
of phase errors are verified experimentally with a three-element ILCOA. Finally, by
loading this three-element ILCOA with rectangular patch antennas, the radiation
characteristics of this antenna array are measured to demonstrate the beam-steering
capability over the operation frequency band.
3.3.1 Circuit Implementation
Figure 3.4 illustrates the circuit schematic diagram of an N -element ILCOA inte-
grated with coupled type-II PLLs. The design frequency is 2.7GHz. The array
43
HMC481 amplifier can be measured by an Agilent 54855A oscilloscope for monitor-
ing the injection signal or loaded by an antenna for radiation.
Each of the oscillators shown in Figure 3.4 consists of a VCO, a Mini-Circuit D17I
directional coupler, a Hittite HMC481 amplifier, and aWilkinson power divider. The
VCO has two output ports, RFout1 and RFout2. RFout1 is connected to a resistive
coupling network for the mutual coupling of the oscillator array. The directional
coupler and power divider separate the signal at RFout2 into three signals. The signal
Vout,i at the output port of each HMC481 amplifier can be measured by an Agilent
54855A oscilloscope or radiated through a connected antenna, while the other two
signals at the output ports of the power divider are applied to the connected PDs
for phase comparison.
The VCO circuit uses an Agilent ATF-54143 low noise enhancement mode pHEMT
with series feedback at the transistor source terminal to provide negative resistance
for oscillation and a Philips BB-131 VHF varactor to tune the free-running fre-
quency. Figure 3.5(a) shows the VCO tuning range and power levels at the two
output ports, which gives Kv ≃ 11MHz/V in the linear region. Figure 3.5(b) shows
the VCO board layout where the pads marked with small circles are vias to the
ground.
The PD uses a Hittite HMC316 double-balanced mixer to measure the phase
difference between the output signals of two successive oscillators. Applying input
signals with the same power level to the RF and LO ports of the PD (13dBm at
2.7GHz in this design) and varying their phase difference ∆θ, the measured PD DC
output voltage Vpd,out shown in Figure 3.6 gives the curve fitting relation as
Vpd,out = 0.72 sin(∆θ − 1.4◦) (3.47)
with Kpd ≃ 0.72V.
The resistive coupling network is implemented with microstrip transmission lines

3.3.2.1 Single-Element Unit
The signals at the output ports of the HMC481 amplifiers fed by the VCO and the
injection signal for the single-element unit are measured with an Agilent 54855A
oscilloscope. The measured values of ∆θ at the different control voltages shown in

difference is shown to be about±90◦, which is in good agreement with the theoretical
result.
The locking range, over which the unit maintains synchronization but it may
not necessarily acquire locking, is measured under the conditions where VT and Vctrl

the mismatch among the PDs. The range of the uniform phase progression is from
−16◦ to 52◦. It demonstrates that the value of the uniform phase progression can
be determined by an accurate and convenient approach. The range becomes smaller
than that of a single-element unit because the difference between the injection signal
frequency and the common frequency of the oscillator array is limited to the locking
range divided by the number of oscillators in the array [14].
The locking range is measured under the same conditions as those of the single-
element unit and gives around 250MHz. The narrower locking range is due to the
variations in the tuning ranges of the three VCOs and the limited range of the
difference between the injection signal frequency and the common frequency of the
oscillator array.

acteristics of the developed beam-steering antenna array. The beam-steering an-
tenna array shown in Figure 3.10(a) is located on a computer-controlled positioner.

results show that the direction of the main beam is controlled through a single control
voltage. In addition, the beam-steering phased array works well and gives similar
radiation patterns over a frequency band ranging from 2.68GHz to 2.72GHz and its
operation frequency is determined by the injection signal. However, it is very time-
consuming for a conventional COA-based antenna array to tune all the oscillators for
proper beam steering over a frequency band. The experimental results demonstrate
that the developed ILCOA-based antenna array integrated with coupled type-II
PLLs can self-tune the free-running frequency distribution of the oscillator array for
beam-steering applications.
51
3.4 Summary
In this chapter, we present the configuration, analysis and experimental results of an
ILCOA circuit. Measurements of the developed oscillator array and the associated
beam-steering antenna array are conducted. Their performances are consistent with
the simulated results. With the use of the coupled type-II PLLs and an external
injection signal, the developed oscillator array can offer its output signals with a uni-
form progressive phase distribution through a single control signal and significantly
reduce the phase errors caused by fluctuations in the amplitudes and free-running
frequencies of the oscillators.
Since the injection signal controls the output frequency of the oscillator array, the
array has the potential for the communication system of multiple-access technique,
such as frequency-division multiple access or code-division multiple access. With
a modulated injection signal, it is also suitable for the frequency modulation and
phase modulation applications. In [56], the study proposes another approach in
an actual communication system, which relies on injection locking for distributing
and phase locking the carrier signal and uses digital-to-analog controlled mixers for
beam-forming and data modulation.
Few remarks on the ILCOA are given in the following. Firstly, as the phase
distribution is more precisely set by coupled type-II PLLs than by a COA, another
promising approach may use coupled type-II PLLs with independent oscillators and
an external reference signal, which will be given in the next chapter. The loop filter
of each element then becomes the design issue. Secondly, although the loop filter
of the inverting integrator would inevitably put a PLL on the verge of instability,
the proposed architecture is stable because COA coupling introduces a zero in the
open-loop transfer function for each PLL, which should be smaller than the PLL
loop bandwidth, i.e. the locking range of injection locking should be larger than
the loop bandwidth of PLL. In other words, COA coupling influences stability and
simplifies the loop filter design. Thirdly, each element of a COA integrated with

Antenna Array Using Coupled
Phase-Locked Loop Array
4.1 Introduction
A phased antenna array can control the direction of its main-lobe and configure its
radiation pattern. Recently, target tracking is attracting considerable attention of
the wireless communication industry. For the purpose of tracking targets, the sum
and difference radiation patterns are the basic array radiation characteristics. The
sum radiation pattern is applicable for target acquiring and range tracking, whereas
the difference radiation pattern is for target viewing angle tracking.
A conventional phased antenna array utilizes a power distribution network, phase
shifters, and control circuits to provide the desired aperture distribution [3,4]. How-
ever, the RF insertion loss, size, and weight of the distribution network and phase
shifters increase the difficulties of circuit design. Besides, a 180◦ hybrid junction
is needed for the antenna array to simultaneously generate the sum and difference
radiation patterns [57].

array consists of an oscillator, a prescaler, a PD, a difference circuit, a LPF, and an
antenna. The prescaler divides the oscillation frequency of the connected oscillator
by a pre-determined factor M . The PD then measures the difference between the
phases of two successive prescalers and produces an output signal as the sine function
of the phase difference by letting the phase shift Φpll = −90◦. In order to generate
the sum or difference radiation pattern for the antenna array, a switch, a non-
inverting buffer amplifier, and an inverting buffer amplifier are arranged as shown
in the center element. The switch dispatches the measured phase difference signal
from the corresponding PD to either a non-inverting buffer amplifier when ψ is logic
high or an inverting one when ψ is logic low, while all the other PDs have their
output signals directly to the respective difference circuits. Note that ψ is the logic
control signal of the switch. The LPF following the difference circuit then tunes the
linked oscillator.

To steer the main-beam with a sum radiation pattern, a spatially uniform phase

factor. When the PD of the center element changes its course to the non-inverting

Kpd
). (4.7)
This then gives the phase distribution for a sum radiation pattern. By varying Vctrl
in (4.7) between its extremes, ∆θi can range between M × (−90◦) and M × 90◦.
Thus, the maximum uniform progressive phase factor is extended by a factor M as
compared with conventional coupled oscillators.
4.2.3 Difference Radiation Pattern
For beam steering with a difference radiation pattern, the solution of a uniform
phase progression with the right half of the array being out of phase to the left half
is desired. When the PD of the center element changes its course to the inverting

4.3.2.1 Single-Element Unit
The output signals of the Hittite HMC481 amplifiers for the single-element unit are
measured with an Agilent 54855A oscilloscope. Figure 4.3 shows the measured phase
difference ∆θ defined in (4.4) at different control voltages for beam steering with
sum radiation patterns. The phase tuning range is about 495◦. Figure 4.4 illustrates

(4.8) because of the non-ideal sinusoidal characteristic of the PD. The measured
ranges of phase tuning for sum and difference pattern radiations are smaller than
the ideal value 540◦, which is mainly caused by the fact that the stability depends on
the phase gradient value. The measured phase errors of these two cases are shown
to be less than about 12◦ for all the values of Vctrl. The phase errors mainly result
from noises and circuit mismatches from fabrication inconsistencies, especially the
PDs.
Figure 4.5 shows the experimental arrangement for measuring the radiation char-
acteristics of the designed three-element antenna array. The reference signal comes
from an Agilent 8722ES vector network analyzer. The antenna array with half-
wavelength spacing between its radiation elements shown in Figure 4.6 is located on
a computer-controlled positioner. The right-end rectangular patch antenna within
the array is fed by the reference signal through a directional coupler and a amplifier,
while the others are connected to the respective VCOs. The radiation pattern is
measured in the far field. To operate this measurement system, a personal computer
is used to perform positioner rotation, spectrum monitoring, and data acquisition

shown in good agreement. The calculated array factors shown in Figure 4.8 testify to
the extended beam-scanning range, which is over ±90◦ as omnidirectional antennas
are used. The null between the two principal lobes also can be precisely steered
by a single control voltage, notwithstanding the fluctuations in the free-running
frequencies of the oscillators. In Figures 4.7 and 4.8, the discrepancies between the
measured and simulated patterns at the side lobes and nulls are mainly due to the
non-uniform oscillation amplitudes of the oscillators.
Note phase leading ∆θld, which exceeds 180
◦, is equal to phase lagging of ∆θld−
360◦ and phase lagging ∆θlg, which is less than −180◦, is equal to phase leading of
∆θlg + 360
◦. Therefore, the main-beam or the null of the radiation pattern would
appear at a negative angle when the uniform phase progression is larger than 180◦,
while it would appear at a positive angle when the uniform phase progression is
smaller than −180◦. These phenomena are observed in Figs. 4.7 and 4.8 as the
control voltage is changed from −0.4V to −0.5V and 0.4V to 0.5V.

Concluding Remarks
5.1 Conclusion
This report presents the methods of phase control for coupled oscillators through
two types of coupling mechanisms, injection locking and PLL, and their applications
in ESAs.
In Chapter 2, basic principles of these two kinds of coupled oscillators are intro-
duced. Circuit structures and their corresponding phase dynamics are described in
detail.
In Chapter 3, an ILCOA circuit configuration is presented with analysis and
experimental results. Using the type-II CPLLA to tune the free-running frequen-
cies of the oscillators and an external signal source to stabilize the array operating
frequency, the developed oscillator array can present a uniform progressive phase
distribution through a DC control signal and significantly reduce the phase errors
caused by fluctuations in the amplitudes and free-running frequencies of the oscil-
lators. Since the operating frequency of the ILCOA is controlled by the external
signal, it has the potential for the communication system of multiple-access tech-
nique, such as frequency-division multiple access or code-division multiple access.
With a modulated external signal, it is also suitable for the frequency modulation
89
presented in Chapter 4 does not encounter this problem. The stability of CPLLA
then should be analyzed, and it is under study.
Each element of these two approaches seems to need a large space due to PLL
circuits. However, they offer not only precise phase control but also real-time phase
monitoring. The system for monitoring the phase distribution can be set up through
digitizing the PD output voltages and processing them with computer software. By
using the multi-layer circuit boards or the MIC technology, the size of the proposed
antenna arrays could be reduced significantly. Moreover, the developed antenna
array would be applied to a two-dimensional array design for communication and
radar system applications.
In addition to the local-oscillator phase-shifting approach [59], the proposed ap-
proach could be applied to phased-array receivers with higher beam-forming accu-
racy and simpler circuit design.
Since an amplifier is introduced in front of each antenna in the antenna array to
provide inter-element isolation, the antenna array could have amplitude tapering if
variable gain amplifiers are used.
