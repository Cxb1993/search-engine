A variety of algorithms have been proposed to deal with reduced guard interval SC based systems.
[1]–[5] have proposed algorithms for reduced-CP based SISO-SC systems. [1] solves the problem of
channel induced interference by using a simple loading scheme to eliminate ISI and IBI. However, it
reduces the transmission rate. [2] proposed a block-by-block decision feedback equalization scheme
which outperforms [1] in terms of BER, but at increased computational cost. A CP-free detection
scheme was proposed in [3] which completely eliminates the use of the CP in order to minimize
transmission overhead. A decision-directed equalization scheme was proposed by [5]. Although [5]
requires less computational complexity than the turbo equalization scheme proposed in [4], it requires
specially designed frame structure before it can be used. A reduced-CP based SIMO-SC FEQ has
also been proposed by [6] which uses beamforming method to suppress ISI and IBI.
The proposed interference cancellation scheme is able to mitigate the IBI and ISI effect brought
about by the reduction, or the elimination, of cyclic prefix, and in addition, can significantly reduce
the effect of overlaid interference, multiple access interference and additive noise. Simulation results
show that the proposed scheme can outperform traditional LMMSE-FDE by 5 dB at BER = 10−3
without incurring much increase in computational complexity. Section II describes the system model,
followed by a detailed description of the proposed scheme in Section III. Complexity analysis and
Monte Carlo simulation results are shown in Section IV and the report is concluded in Section V.
This work serves as a extension of our previous work done on uplink transmission using OFDM.
Similar to this work, the proposed null subcarrier based interference cancellation technique was also
able to overcame ISI and ICI incurred due to insufficient cyclic prefix, as well as overlaid system
interference an co-channel interference. These techniques would enhance the throughput of the system
by reducing the amount of overhead required for transmission.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
The information-bearing symbols {u(j),∀j} are segmented at the transmitter, into blocks ofN sym-
bols. Represent the kth block as an N -element vector, u(k) =
[
u−N
2
+1(k), · · · , u0(k), · · · , uN
2
(k)
]T
,
where un(k) = u
(
kN + N2 − 1 + n
)
, for n = −N2 + 1, . . . , N2 .
Prefix u(k) with a length-G guard interval, which could be a cyclic prefix, i.e. a replication of
the last v entries of u(k). Mathematically, this cyclic-prefixing operation equals the multiplication of
u(k) into an (N +G)×N cyclic-prefix-insertion matrix Tcp =
 0G×(N−G) IG
IN
, to produce the
(N + G)-element vector, u˜(k) = Tcpu(k). This CP serves to reduce or to eliminate up to G taps
of inter-block interference (IBI), caused by a frequency-selective fading channel. The guard interval
needs not be a cyclic prefix as above, but could be entirely zero-energy symbols, or some mix of the
deploys a guard interval (comprising of zero-energy symbols, plus an optional cyclic prefix) that
may be shorter than the channel impulse response. From the data received during the zero-energy
symbol intervals, the proposed scheme estimates the combined effects of the signal-of-interest’s self-
interference, of any multiple access user interference, of any overlaid interference, and of the additive
noises. These denigrating effects are then subtracted from the information-bearing parts of the symbol
block, via a SINR-maximizer in the receiver. This interference suppression approach philosophically
resembles the null-subcarriers based methods in [7], [8] for OFDM, though the system architectures
and the algorithmic details are very different. The present scheme can operate with any non-zero
number of zero-energy symbols, with or without a cyclic prefix.
This zeros-inserting precoding can be realized by an N× (N−P ) precoding matrix Tzero, formed
by inserting P number of all-zero rows into an (N − P ) × (N − P ) identity matrix. For example,
appending all these zeros would require a precoding matrix of Tzero =
 I(N−P )×(N−P )
0P×(N−P )
.
B. The Proposed Two-Stage Equalizer
At the receiver, (1) remains valid despite the zero-inserting precoder, but now has u(k) = Tzeros(k).
The proposed linear equalizer involves a post-FFT linear single-tap-per-subcarrier frequency-domain
equalizer (FDE) W, followed by a post-IFFT signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) maximizer in
the time-domain. These are shown in Figure 1.

Rzero and Jzero involve no multiplication nor addition – these do not contribute to the real-time
computational load.

IV. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS
The information-bearing symbols {s(k)} are modulated with equiprobable QPSK-symbols. The
transmitted signal has N = 64. The channel impulse response has Q+ 1 = 11 complex-valued taps,
each randomly generated and not cross-correlated among themselves. Each tap’s real-value part and
imaginary-value part are not cross-correlated. Each tap is Gaussian, zero-mean. The qth tap has an
exponentially decaying variance of σ2q =
(
1− e−
Ts
TRMS
)
e
−q Ts
TRMS ,∀q = 0, · · · , Q, where Ts denotes
the sampling period, and TRMS symbolizes the root-mean-square delay-spread of the channel. The
additive noise is complex-value, temporally uncorrelated, zero-mean, Gaussian, with a noise power
of σ2η(k)η(k).
Consider these two curves in Figure 2:
(i) The top dashed black curve at G = 6 and P = 0 (i.e. an insufficient CP but no zeros-inserting
precoding).
(ii) The bottom green curve at G = 0 and P = 6 (i.e. no CP but 6 zeros-inserted by the precoder,
as proposed in this report).
These two curves both incur the same overhead of P + G = 6 symbols, but the proposed scheme
lowers the BER by 1− 9×10−43.8×10−3 = 76% at SNR= 15dB, and by 1− 3.2×10
−5
1.4×10−3 = 98% at SNR= 25dB.
In terms of the computational complexity for case (ii) above, Table I suggests that the proposed
scheme would increase the popular LMMSE-FDE method’s number of complex-value multiplications
by 60% and the number of complex-value additions by 45%.
Alternatively, if the transmission overhead is lightened to just 4 inserted zeros (i.e. (6+64)−(4+64)6+64 =
2.9% reduction overhead on the data-rate) but no cyclic prefix, then the proposed scheme can still
lower the BER by 1− 2.9×10−33.8×10−3 = 24% at SNR= 15dB, and by 1− 7.8×10
−4
1.4×10−3 = 44% at SNR= 25dB.

interference alignment.  All of these presentations are highly related to my current research topics in 
signal processing and communications.  I also attended three plenary presentations given by Prof. Sergio 
Verdu on “What is Information Theory?", Prof. Sergios Theordoridis on “Adaptive Learning in a World 
of Projections”, and Prof. Helmut Bolcskei on “Uncertainty Relations and Signal Recovery”.  The first 
one gave an overview on information theory, its impact in diverse areas in signal processing, and what the 
future direction in IT should be.  The second one discussed the deficiencies of today’s parameter 
estimation technique and proposed a novel approach based on projections on intersection of sets to the 
problem that would eliminate such deficiencies.  The third one showed how uncertainty relations allow 
to build a unified framework for understanding the fundamental limits of a wide range of signal 
reconstruction problems. 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
The 2011 European Signal Processing Conference is the flagship conference of EURASIP. The 
conference focuses on key aspects related to signal processing.  Exploration of new avenues and 
methodologies of communications are also encouraged.  Areas of interests include selected areas in 
communications (such as cognitive radio, cooperative communications, smart grid communications), 
communication theory, signal processing for communications, wireless communications, wireless and 
mobile networking, adhoc, sensor and mesh networking, signal recovery, detection and estimation, and 
audio and electroacoustics.  There were numerous plenary talks, tutorial sessions and technical sessions 
(35 in total).  Finally, I was able to present my paper during the Signal Processing for Communications 
session.  The proceedings of the conference were provided, as well as the conference schedule, which 
eased navigation at the conference venue. 
 
四、建議 
I strongly recommend my own students to attend this conference as it contains many papers relevant to 
their research.  Since this is the flagship conference of EURASIP, not only will the students benefit from 
the technical content, but they will also be able to meet many people who are working in similar research 
areas.  I have found enhancements in my own research through active discussions with many of these 
experts during and after the conference.  This conference also serves to give students more of a global 
view of what is going around besides the research topics they are working on.  This will be extremely 
useful to Ph.D. students, who will possibly be faculty themselves upon graduation, in order to assist them 
in selecting which research topics others are working on and problems that remain to be solved.  Besides, 
the tutorials are free of charge and it serves to encourage more people to attend.
