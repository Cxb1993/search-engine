1. Abstract 
 
A controllable damper, which is also 
referred to as a semi-active device or a 
variable passive damper, has the advantages 
of being able to generate a large control force 
with very low energy consumption. In this 
study, a controllable damper called a variable 
friction damper (VFD) is applied to enhance 
the seismic performance of an isolation 
system subjected to near-fault earthquakes. 
Both theoretical and experimental studies 
have been carried out. In the theoretical 
study, the effectiveness of using a 
controllable VFD in an isolation system was 
demonstrated numerically. In order to 
determined the on-line clamping force of the 
VFD, some fuzzy friction controllers have 
been proposed. In the experimental study, the 
feasibility of isolation systems with a VFD 
has been verified experimentally by a 
harmonic shaking table test. The controllable 
clamping force of the VFD is generated by 
an embedded piezoelectric actuator. The test 
data are illustrated in this paper.  
Keywords: controllable damper, semi-active 
control, fuzzy controller, friction damper, 
seismic isolation, piezoelectric material.

2. Motivation and Objective 
The application of controllable dampers 
to earthquake engineering is investigated in 
this studied. A controllable damper is also 
referred to as a variable passive damper or a 
semi-active control device. Generally, a 
semi-active control device has the following 
advantages over an active control one [1]: (1) 
the force of a semi-active device can be 
controlled by varying some of its internal 
parameters. Controlling internal parameters 
of the device generally requires much less 
control energy. (2) The force generated by a 
semi-active device, which is exerted by the 
relative motion between the device and the 
structure, is basically a passive (resistance) 
force; therefore, the semi-active force is not

Figs. 2 and 3 compare, respectively, the 
far-field and near-fault responses of the 
SAFC-V-Vg controller to those of the 
uncontrolled system. Note that in both 
figures the PGA level of all earthquakes has 
been scaled to 0.4g for the purpose of 
comparison. As shown in Fig. 3, the 
semi-active isolation system with SAFC-V- 
Vg controller greatly reduces the structural 
acceleration and base displacement responses 
simultaneously in a near-fault earthquake, 
whereas in Fig. 2 the controller results in a 
roughly equal level of acceleration response 
and a much less base displacement in a 
far-field earthquake.

3.2 Experimental study – harmonic test 
In the experimental study, a semi-active 
isolation system controlled by a piezoelectric 
VFD damper was fabricated (see Fig. 4). As 
shown in Fig. 4, a piezoelectric actuator, 
which has the features of low energy demand 
and quick response [4], is embedded in the 
VFD to control the clamping force. As a 
result, the slip force of the VFD damper, 
which is an energy dissipating force, can be 
regulated on-line to mitigate the response of 
the isolated system.  
In order to observe how the dynamic 
hysteretic behavior of the isolation system is 
changed, as the control voltage of the 
piezoelectric actuator is changed, a harmonic 
shaking table test was conducted. In the test, 
a harmonic ground motion of frequency 
1.5Hz was imposed on the system. The peak 
ground acceleration (PGA) was scaled to 600 
cm/s2. A open-loop control of constant 
voltages was considered in this preliminary 
study.  The constant driving voltage for the 
VFD was increased from 0, 300, 600 to 900 
volt step-wise. Fig. 5 shows the time 
histories of the clamping force N, which is 
controllable by changing the driving voltage 
V of the VFD.  Fig. 6 shows the relation 
between N and V.  From the figure, it is 
observed that the clamping force N is almost 
linearly proportional to the driving voltage V. 
The slope of the regression line in Fig. 7 
represents the piezoelectric coefficient Cz.  
The value of Cz identified by Fig.7 is 1.30 
N/V.

Equation 1 describes the hysteretic behavior 
(force-displacement relation) of the PFPI isolator.  
The above equation was obtained by assuming that 
the isolator slope and frictional coefficient is much 
smaller than one, i.e., 1)( <<′ xy  and 1<<µ .  The 
terms )(xur  and uf (x) physically represent, respec-
tively, the restoring force and friction force compo-
nents in the total shear U (x). The restoring force 
)(xur  provides the re-centering ability for the isola-
tion system.  This force is proportional to the slope 
)(xy′  of the sliding surface.  It implies that by 
properly selecting the geometric function y(x) of the 
sliding surface, the sliding isolation system may 
possess a desirable mechanical behavior and favor-
able dynamic characteristics.

Figure 2.  Normalized restoring force of a PFPI.  
 
In this paper, the geometric function of the PFPI 
sliding surface is defined by the following sixth-
order polynomial function 
246 )21()41()61()( excxaxxy ++=
            (4) 
where a, c, e are three constant coefficients. Note 
that the above geometric function is an even func-
tion that is symmetric about the y-axis and passes 
through the origin. Moreover, by using Equation 4 in 
Equation 2 the isolator restoring force of a PFPI can 
be expressed as 
excxaxxyPxur ++==
35)('/)(
 (5) 
Note that ur (x) in Equation 5 is normalized with 
respect to the vertical load P. This normalized re-
storing force is exactly equal to the first deriva-
tive )(xy′ , so )(xy′  can be treated as a normalized 
restoring force. 
The fifth-order polynomial function )(xy′  given 
in Equation 5 is an odd function. A curve defined by 
this function will pass through the origin of the co-
ordinates and anti-symmetric about the origin, as 
shown in Figure 2. In addition, the curve in Figure 2 
has three retroflexion points. Due to the anti-
symmetry of the curve, one of the retroflexion points 
must be located at the origin; while the other two 
points will be determined by the three polynomial 
coefficients a, c and e in Equation 5. By properly 
choosing the values of the three coefficients a, c and 
e, the restoring-force function )(xy′  of a PFPI will 
possess a softening section followed by a hardening 
section (like the one shown in Figure 2), when the 
isolator displacement x is increasing. In the soften-
ing section, the isolator stiffness is decreased, while 
in the hardening section the stiffness is increased. 
The purpose of the softening section is to mitigate 
the acceleration response for an earthquake below 
the design level; while, the purpose of the hardening 
section is to reduce the isolator drift for a sever 
earthquake beyond the design level, and to prevent 
the possible stability problem of the isolation sys-
tem.  In brief, the softening and hardening sections 
aim to control the structural acceleration and isolator 
drift, respectively. 
Because the three coefficients a, c, e in Equation 
5 have no engineering meaning, it is better to replace 
these coefficients by some engineering parameters.  
To do so, let us define three design parameters 0k , 
1k , 1D  (see Figure 2): (1) 0k  is the normalized ini-
tial stiffness at 0=x , i.e., 0)0(" ky = . (2) 1D  is the 
critical isolator drift, after which the PFPI system 
will switch from the acceleration control to dis-
placement control.  Geometrically, this means that 
1Dx =  is a retroflexion point of the )(xy′  function, 
i.e., 0)('" 1 =Dy . (3) 1k  is the normalized isolator 
stiffness at 1Dx = , i.e., 11 )(" kDy = .  Next, by using 
the above three conditions, one may obtain the fol-

4 SHAKING TABLE TEST OF A PFPI 
ISOLATED STRUCTURE 
4.1 Test setup and input ground motions 
In order to evaluate the seismic performance of the 
proposed PFPI system experimentally, a shaking ta-
ble test was conducted in this study.  The test setup 
involved a full-scale one-story steel frame model 
isolated by four PFPI isolators (see Figure 6). The 
steel frame, which is 3-meter in height and weights 
12 metric tons, has a fundamental frequency (fixed 
based) of 2.5 Hz and a damping ratio of 1%. The de-
sign parameters of the PFPI isolators were the same 
as those used in the cyclic test mentioned previously. 
Displacement and acceleration sensors were placed 
on each floor of the tested model and also on the iso-
lation system for the measurement of the accelera-
tion and displacement of the isolated structure.  
The time histories of two ground accelerations 
with strong near-fault characteristics were consid-
ered as the input excitations in the test (see Figure 
7). One is an artificially generated type-B pulse 
wave defined by Makris & Chang (2000) (see Figure 
7(a)); while, the other is a real earthquake record 
measured in the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake (El 
Centro Array #6 station) (see Figure 7(b)). Note that 
in the test the pulse period of Figure 7(a) was ad-
justed to 2.0 second to simulate a long-period pulse, 
and the peak ground acceleration (PGA) was scaled 
to 250 gal. On the other hand, the PGA of Figure 
7(b) earthquake was scaled to 350 gal in the test, due 
to the limitation of the shaking table. In Figure 7(b), 
an obvious long-period pulse waveform can also be 
observed in the range of 5 to 10 seconds. By Makris 
& Chang’s (2000) classification, Figure 7(b) earth-
quake can be classified as a type-B near-fault earth-
quake with a pulse period around 3.2 seconds.  
4.2 Results of the shaking table test 
Figures 8(a) and 9(a) depict, respectively, the meas-
ured isolator drift and super-structural acceleration 
responses of the PFPI isolated test frame that was 
subjected to the type-B pulse excitation (artificial 
earthquake). For the comparison, the simulated re-
sponses of the same frame isolated by a FPS system 
are also shown in Figures 8(b) and 9(b). In the simu-
lation, a typical isolation period of 2.0 second and a 
friction coefficient µ =0.09 (same as PFPI) were 
used for the FPS. From Figures 8 and 9, it is evident 
that the PFPI considerably reduces the maximum 
isolator drift to only 20% of that of the FPS system; 
at the meantime, it also reduces the structural accel-
eration to about 60% of the FPS acceleration.  
Similarly, Figures 10 and 11 compare the re-
sponses of PFPI and FPS isolation systems, when 
both are subjected to the realistic near-fault ground 
motion, Figure 7(b) (Imperial Valley earthquake). 
From these two figures, it is observed that, as com-
pared with the FPS response, the PFPI reduced the 
isolator drift to about 60% of the FPS without ampli-
fying the structural acceleration response.  
5 COMPARISON WITH THE THEORETICAL 
RESULTS  
The data of the shaking test was also verified by a 
theoretical result, in order to ensure the reliability of 
the test data. The theoretical result was obtained 
from a numerical method that is able to deal with the 
nonlinearity effect of )(tur and )(tu f  in the PFPI 
formulation. Figure 12(a) compares the experimental 
and theoretical structural accelerations of the PFPI 
isolated structure subjected to a 1-Hz harmonic exci-
tation of PGA=250g, while Figure 12(b) compares 
the hysteresis loops of the PFPI isolator. Both fig-
ures show that the experimental and theoretical data 
have very good consistence. This implies that the 
test data is reliable.
