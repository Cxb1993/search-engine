Chapter 1   
Introduction and Summary of Research Works 
 
1. Overview 
Reflector antenna systems are popularly employed in the applications of satellite 
communications. With the increase utilization of wireless frequency bands and popularity of satellite 
communications, the design of reflector antenna systems becomes more complicated then ever. The 
frequency bands tend to become very high frequencies, reflector sizes tend to increase in terms of 
wavelengths, and the beam width tends to become very small. As a result, advanced technologies 
continue to be in demand. The research team of this research proposal has developed fundamental 
technologies for the design of reflector antennas under the financial support of NSC. Previous works 
focused on the analysis and synthesis of reflector surfaces. Simulation codes have been developed 
and applied to develop practical system in terms of cooperation with industries. Good results have 
been demonstrated in the commercial product design with industries and in the paper publications. 
The research team is capable of developing advanced technologies to fulfill future requirement of 
reflector antenna designs in the applications of satellite communications. This research proposal 
addresses the works that the research team intends to develop for the next stage. The goal is to 
develop advanced technologies that can lead the antenna designs in the future phase of satellite 
communications. Particular subjects cover several topics including extending the previous works to 
treat more general reflector problems in the fast analysis and synthesis , new synthesis techniques 
that can be used to design sophisticate reflector systems , and multi -band feed synthesis capability . 
Also we would like to expand our research scope to cover the design of feed antenna system  that the 
entire reflector antenna systems can be designed optimally including broadband feed antenna and 
optimal feed antenna radiation system. Potential technologies covering the dual band feed antenna 
system will be studies. The development of the proposed works will allow the related technologies 
being handheld by the local engineers and assist the local industries as well as government to develop 
the major products in the satellite communications which have been considered as one of the major 
national developing directions. In this report, the developed technologies are presented, which were 
developed in the past few yeas.

HFSS as an electromagnetic computational engine and an add-on optimization scheme of genetic 
algorithm. It is motivated by the need of antenna operations at multiband frequencies, where an 
optimum design of horn antenna may significantly increase the efficiency because its narrow beams 
at higher frequencies will illuminate only a portion of the reflector surface. The quality of the antenna 
design will mainly rely on an effective optimization algorithm that can be and should be developed 
independently according to engineers’ own need since the variables and cost functions for 
optimization can be flexibly selected. The integration of existing analysis codes, which is very 
reliable in analysis, and self-developed algorithms will be most effective for an engineer in the 
customized antenna design. The concepts and strategies are addressed with numerical examples to 
validate.

employed to analyze the reflector antenna very efficiently without the need for ray tracing or 
numerical integration. 
 Previous GB solutions[8,9] have a shortcoming of being restricted to treat reflector antennas with 
perfectly conducting surfaces. This paper further extends the solutions in[8,9] and allows it to treat 
reflector antennas of  dielectric or imperfectly conducting materials. A variety of applications can be 
employed with this extended solution such as the increasing interest in the fast analysis of FSSs 
(frequency selective surfaces) sub-reflectors in a dual reflector antenna system[13], and so on. The 
core of the extension relies on a development of the scattered field in terms of a new, but similar 
closed form solution, due to a GB incident on the dielectric reflector. Similar to the development of 
previous solutions [8], the induced PO-based currents[7,13] are used in the radiation integral to find 
the scattered field via asymptotical evaluation[14]. The required reflected and transmitted fields over 
the reflectors, which are required to define the induced equivalent currents, are found by assuming 
similar forms in terms of GBs [15], i.e. the reflection and transmission of the incident GB are 
approximated by GBs of similar forms. Complex phase matching techniques [16] are employed to 
define the parameters of the reflected and transmitted GBs. Once the parameters are found, the 
incident, reflected and transmitted GBs are employed to define the induced electric and magnetic 
currents [13]. The advantage of this approximation is that complex phase matching techniques will 
ensure similar forms of phase variations over the reflector surfaces. This makes all the parameters 
obtained from asymptotic evaluations, such as from saddle and edge points, similar to those in the 
previous work [8]. Note that uniform dielectric characteristics are assumed over the entire reflector in 
this development. The existing analysis code can be modified in a very simple fashion with only 
some simple parameter changes. 
This paper is formatted in the following order. Section 2 describes the theoretical development of 
the GB solution extensions, and its application to the analysis of dielectric reflector antennas. In 
particular, section 2A reviews the fundamental concepts of the PO analysis. The scattered field of a 
GB incident on the dielectric reflector is summarized in section 2B. The application of the GB 
techniques to analyze the scattering from the dielectric reflector is overviewed in section 2C. Finally 
numerical examples and a discussion are presented in section 3 to validate the proposed approach.

complex phase matching technique. The incident GB is assumed to be in the form [8]

(6a)-(6b) remain valid within the paraxial region of GB axis. Also in (6a) O  is assumed to be the 
point where the axis of the GB hits the reflecting surface.  The matrix iQ  in (6a) defines the phase

  It is further assumed that the reflector surface in the vicinity of O  is approximated by a local 
paraboloid with two principal radii of curvatures, 1  and 2 , along the surface principal directions xˆ  
and yˆ ,respectively with origin located at O . The local surface is expressed by

In the implementation of the complex phase matching technique as illustrated in Figure 3, it is 
assumed that the reflected and transmitted fields can also be approximated by similar forms of GB, 
and the localized surface in (8) is not truncated. In another word, the reflected and transmitted GBs

For the case of deep thickness, reflected and transmitted GBs should be treated individually with 
each resulting in a similar form of (18).  It is noted that each term of (18) has a form identical to (21) 
in [8], and can be evaluated asymptotically by following the similar procedure described in [8] in 
terms of complex saddle point contributions and edge point contributions (see (62) in [8]). 
Nevertheless, due to a fact that the parameters obtained from asymptotic evaluation are mainly 
dependent on the phase variations of (18) that is identical to that of (21) in [8], the parameters 
obtained in [8] can be directly used here. For the purpose of simplification, the reader is referred to [8] 
for detailed derivations.   
C. Applications in the Analysis of Dielectric Reflector Antennas with General Source 
Illumination 
The applications of the developed GB techniques for the analysis of electrically large reflector 
antennas with highly conductive materials can be performed in a same fashion as described in [9]. 
The procedure is summarized in the following. The radiation external to the feed plane is represented 
by a set of relatively few, rotationally symmetric GBs launched radially outward from the phase 
center of the feed plane and with constant inter-axis angular spacing [9,15]. One example of the 
angular spacing grids is shown in Figure 4 where 
fsinfy;fcosfx                         (20) 
and )f,f(   are the spherical angular coordinates for the rays emanating from the feed. Also 
max in Figure 4 is used to define an angular cone in which the feed radiation illuminates the reflector

that is a frequency independent quantity. A similar expression can be found for the TE case by 
following a similar procedure in [17]. In the following examples we assume uniform conductivity 
and permittivity for the reflector (i.e., ZrZ )'( ). Based on the definitions of (21) and (22), the 
reflection and transmission coefficients can be found [18] by

be found from (23) and (24) based on the relation between electric and magnetic fields along the 
direction of plane wave propagation.  
The accuracy and efficiency of the present GB approach are demonstrated by comparing them 
with reference solutions obtained via a direct numerical evaluation of the PO integral in (1). For 
simplicity, the feed antenna is a Huygen's source and is tilted so that its broadside radiation is directed 
to the center of the reflector and its electric current moment lies in the x=0” plane. 
The first example demonstrates the radiation of a single beam incident on the reflector surface, 
where a part of the beam will illuminate the edge of the reflector and edge diffraction effects will 
appear in its radiation. In this case, the incident GB is rotational symmetric and has a 3dB waist of 
9.64” with center of the waist located at the focal point of the reflector. The situation is illustrated in 
Figure 5(b) where the reflector has a diameter D=28'', offset d=0”, and the focal length F=18” at 
frequency of 5GHz. Figure 7(a) and (b) shows the radiation far field patterns at the o0  plane in 
comparison with a reference solution of direct PO integration over (1) with resistances of 10 and 
100 used in (23) and (24). It is seen that both solutions agree very well in these two cases on the 
main beam and first side lobe. Note that the asymptotic GB solutions described in [8] require a 
significantly small illumination spot on the reflector surface, and the scattered fields consist of the 
reflected and diffracted fields arising from the local spot area. The case of Figure 7 demonstrates a 
worst situation where a large spot illumination has occurred. The second side lobe occurs mainly due

are the same for all frequencies since the number of GB’s used remains the same. On the other hand, 
the CPU time of PO solutions increases with the increase of frequency because the electrical size of 
the reflector surface increases with square of frequency. Furthermore, the CPU time of GB solutions 
is a small portion of that obtained by PO. Also shown in Figure 14(b) is variation of errors associated 
with this examination of CPU time while the frequency sweeps from 11 to 19 GHz, which is defined 
by

The errors are evaluated with co-polarized components of the radiation main beam patterns within 
angles of o5.1 on two principle planes, where 150 samples were uniformly selected with units of dB 
used in the patterns. It may be observed that the errors remain fairly constant of less than 3% for all 
the frequencies.  
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper extends GB solutions that were previously limited to treat perfectly conducting reflectors 
to analyze reflector antennas with general dielectric materials. The solution is as compact as the 
previous solutions, and can be straightforwardly incorporated into the existing codes. Numerical 
examples are demonstrated based on its application to analyze the scattering problems of reflector 
antennas with resistive surfaces. It is found that this GB solution remains the accuracy and efficiency 
as demonstrated in the previous solutions in comparison with PO solutions.

Hybrid GB and PO Analysis of Electromagnetic Radiation/Scattering from Large 
Reflector Antennas with Tapered Impedance Surfaces 
 
1. Introduction 
The developing trend of reflector antennas involves with the utilization of impedance reflecting 
surfaces. In many applications, such as in the compact range measurement systems[1,2], the surfaces 
are terminated with tapered impedance in the vicinity of the edge boundaries in order to reduce the 
diffractions from the reflector truncations, which results in difficulties of analysis for most of the 
previously available methods. Ray based solutions[3,4] are not valid within the ray caustics regions, 
and solutions for tapered impedance surfaces are not available. On the other hand, numerical 
integration based solutions of aperture integration (AI) and physical optics (PO) [5] are popularly 
employed, but suffer from computational inefficiency for large reflector antennas. Recently a 
Gaussian beam (GB) technique[6,7] was developed to accelerate the PO computation. The GB 
approach is efficient because it completely avoids the numerical integration. However, currently GB 
solutions are available only for reflecting surfaces with uniformly distributed impedance and smooth 
truncations, and can not be applied directly in this problem. 
This paper proposes a hybrid scheme combining GB and PO approaches to fast analyze these 
reflector antenna problems. In this hybrid scheme the reflecting surface is decomposed into two 
portions that can be treated efficiently by the GB approach and PO, respectively. The interior portion 
with uniformly distributed impedance and smooth truncation boundaries can be well treated by the 
GB techniques in [6,7]. On the other hand, the exterior portion of the reflecting surface, where 
tapered impedance occurs, can be treated utilizing numerical integration of regular PO approach. In 
most of practical application, the exterior portion is sufficiently small so that overall efficiency and 
accuracy can be well retained.

validate this hybrid scheme. The reflector under investigation has a diameter of 100” and focal length 
of 70”, which is offset by 20” to avoid feed blockage. The feed is assumed to be a Hygen’s source 
operated at a frequency of 11.803GHz. The reflector has uniform impedance of 10 in the interior 
region and an exponentially tapered resistance along the edge boundaries described by[1]

where sx  and ex  are the radial starting and edge points of the reflecting surface to impose the tapered 
resistance. sZ and eZ  denote the beginning and ending resistance in Ω associated with sx  and ex . In 
practice, eZ  is sufficiently large in order to obtain small edge diffractions. In this case, sx =90” and 
sx =100” on the projected aperture, and sZ =10 and eZ =1000, respectively.  
  The first case assumes feed located at focal point of the reflector. Figure 4 shows the near field 
pattern of observation points located at y=0” cut on the z=40” plane, where excellent agreements 
with reference solution have been observed. It is noted that less than 100 GB’s are employed in the 
computation and PO is employed in the analysis of exterior region of reflector with tapered 
impedance. Similar accuracy has also observed in the examination of far field pattern as shown in 
Figure 5. The second case considers 5 defocusing feed that is now located at (0”, 3.781”, 66.729”) 
and, examines the accuracy in the prediction of far field pattern. In this case, as shown in Figure 6, 
excellent agreement has been achieved.  
   Based on the above examinations, it can be observed that this hybrid scheme can be accurately 
employed in the analysis of reflector with tapered impedance edges. Since in most practical 
applications the surface with tapered impedance is only a small portion, the efficiency of GB 
approach analysis can be retained.

Fast Steepest Decent Method for Shaped Reflector Antennas to Synthesize 
Contoured Beams via Patch Decompositions in Physical Optics Integrals 
  
1. Introduction 
Fast design of large shaped reflector antennas remains challenging due to their increasing sizes 
needed in the applications of satellite and wireless communications [1~7]. Such challenges arise 
from the computational inefficiency in numerical radiation analysis that becomes dramatically 
cumbersome as the reflector size or operational frequency increase, and needs to be repeatedly 
performed at every loop of an iterative synthesis procedure. Thus, in the past, efforts have been 
focused in developing fast radiation analysis or convergent synthesis techniques in a relatively 
independent fashion.  
Typical works for the fast analysis techniques are exampled in [8,9] with most using the 
approximations of physical optics (PO) or aperture integration (AI) by numerically integrating 
radiation integrals. Either Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or expansions over the integrands using 
properly selected bases, such as Gaussian beams (GB)[4,5,10], which give closed solutions for the 
radiation integral, are performed at endurable sacrifice of accuracy. Synthesis techniques previously 
successfully employed are referenced in [3,11-13] including genetic algorithm (GA) [11], steepest 
decent method (SDM) [3], successive projection method (SPM) [12] and particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) [13]. Acceleration efforts were attempted to use less variables by representing 
reflector surfaces in terms of basis functions [7,14], and using the associated coefficients as variables 
for optimization. It may however loss freedoms for global optimization. More reduction in the 
number of variables causes more freedom loss, and tradeoffs between efficiency and optimum must 
be made. 
This paper presents an useful technique of synthesis procedure. It first discretizes the reflector 
surface into small patches whose sizes are selected sufficiently small to accurately approximate the 
reflector’s radiation by the superposition of each patch’s component in the PO radiation integral. The 
z-components of grid nodes’ coordinates are used as variables in conjunction with a SDM synthesis 
technique to determine the shaped reflector surface. It looks, at a first glance, to complicate the 
synthesis procedure since the number of variables has now been increased dramatically to cause 
cumbersome numerical computations for the derivatives of a cost function in SDM. However, the 
proposed works using patch decompositions for the radiation integral exhibit advantages by 
providing approximate but in closed-form solutions for the derivatives. The overall computational

decomposition makes (5) dependent on the corners’ parameters, and allows one to employ the corner 
locations as the optimization variables. A practical implementation selects the locations of corners 
first, which globally distribute over the reflecting surface, and determine the patches.  
 
D. Efficient Synthesis Procedure via Steepest Decent Method 
    SDM gives gradual parameters’ changes and results in a smooth reflector surface. It starts with 
defining a cost function in terms of sampled radiation patterns as [3]

df G G

     

                                                         (8) 
where sN  is a number of samples and G  is the normalized gain at 
th  field point with dG  being its 
desired value. Both sidelobe and cross-polarization levels are controlled by specifying dG  in the 
sampled points, and are considered as different sampled gains. f  is introduced in (8) to emphasize 
some desired gains, which is useful for side-lobe and cross-polarization suppression since their 
values are very small.  
In SDM the variables, ( 1 ~ )q q Q  with Q being the number of variables defining the reflector 
surface, is optimally changed in an iterative fashion by minimizing (8) using (9), that is, q  at 
 1 thi   iteration can be found by[6]

   with fr  being the feed’s location.  vˆ  is the unit 
vector indicating the polarization of interest, and may be used to specify co- or cross-polarizations. 
Note that (10) is a closed-form solution, and is continuous over the surface. As a result, not only the 
derivatives of (8) can be efficiently computed even though the number of corners can be very large, 
but also the synthesized surface retains smooth along the iterative procedure.   
E. A Useful Criterion to Choose   
SDM uses (9) to update qz  iteratively. The changes of qz , qz , in each iteration are controlled 
by a proper selection of  , and result in phase changes for the equivalent moments in (6) in a way 
that the superposition of their radiations will approach the desired contoured patterns. It can be 
achieved by allowing  qz  varying within a half wavelength. Thus    is selected such that 
maximum qz in each iteration is less than a half wavelength. A safe value is less than 0.25 
wavelength so that the overall maximum qz  after the complete of synthesis may retain less than a 
half wavelength. In practice,   should be continuously decreases as the synthesis proceeds since 
SDM converges very fast in the first few rounds of iteration and qz  will become gradually smaller. 
One may simply decrease   to a quarter or 0.1 of its value in the previous iteration when the value of 
cost function in (8) is found to increase, and retain this value for the next iteration. 
  
3. Numerical Validation and Discussion 
A. Analysis of Computational Complexity 
Computational complexity justified by counting the number of terms associated with the 
operation of summations in an iteration of numerical evaluation is examined. One first examines the 
computation complexity in traditional SDM. Assuming bN basis functions are used to represent the 
reflector surface in conventional SDM, the number of terms is counted in the following. Using (5) to 
find sN fields for (8) requires c sN N terms. Each iteration needs to find bN ( bQ N  in (9)) 
derivatives numerically for (9), and requires c s bN N N   terms. Similarly the number of terms in 
the proposed work is counted in the following.  Using (5) to find the sN fields for (8) needs c sN N  
terms. Using (9) to find mN  derivatives ( )m cN N  for (9) needs m sN N  terms. Thus if the number 
of iterations is not considered, the proposed work apparently has a better efficiency by cutting the 
computational complexity in an order of bN .

continuity of the synthesized surface.   
Finally the CPU time, running on an Acer Notebook with Intel 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo Processor 
T7500,  is 5.1718 seconds for the computation in an iteration with total time less than 35 minutes to 
complete the synthesis and achieve the results shown in Figure 5. 
  
4. Conclusion 
This paper presents an effective approach for the fast synthesis of shaped reflector antennas to 
radiate contoured beams employing SDM. This method exhibits largest freedoms by using a large 
number of variables in the synthesis, where the surface grid nodes are used. Closed form and 
continuous solutions of cost function’s derivatives are developed, which allows the surface varying 
smoothly while, in the mean time, retaining the computational efficiency. Numerical examples show 
that the computational complexity in this work can be reduced by an order of Q (the number of 
variables in traditional SDM using numerical computations to find the derivatives of a cost function). 
It is found in this work that SDM convergence is very fast in the first few rounds of iteration and 
tends to slow down. Future work will focus on improving the convergence rate.

allows the design procedures, variables and cost functions for optimization be flexibly selected and 
defined  to the best extent of an engineer’s experiences and knowledge without the need of spending 
months of time to learn the full scope of the commercial codes, which has been design to fit a wide 
variety of antenna problems, before their problems can be solved. The integration of this existing 
analysis code and self-developed algorithms is apparently most effective for an engineer in the 
customized antenna design. Furthermore, it may extend the application scopes of the simulation tool 
since a variety of new features may be developed.  
This code integration is developed to automate the optimization process. A program is established 
to monitor the optimization process and interact with the computation engine, which is HFSS in this 
paper, to optimize the radiations of the feed horn antennas. It may, however, be extended to treat a 
variety of antenna types since the fundamental concepts and code structure remain similar. The 
procedure begins with an initial setting within the framework of HFSS. The computation engine 
returns prescribed performance parameters (i.e., the radiation patterns, return loss and etc.). The 
program next adjusts the stepping size of the adjustable parameters according to its built-in 
optimization algorithm. Above process is performed iteratively until the desired performance or the 
specified iteration number is met. In this paper, generic algorithm (GA) [10~12] is employed to 
realize the concept because it can be effectively employed to optimize discrete variables.  
As to its application potentials, such an add-on optimization program could be made more 
capable than the optimization functions provided by commercial simulation packages, and reduce the 
efforts and time of an user to start their antenna design. The optimization criteria are not limited to 
antenna structure parameters, and can be the structure itself, which is suitable for antenna design 
using genetic algorithms. Furthermore, design packages from different venders could be coordinated 
using this intermediate program, and thus create most values in the antenna design. A potential 
example is to further integrate the EM analysis code of the reflector antennas [13,14], which will 
make the design of the entire reflector antenna system in a self-completeness fashion. This extension 
will be reported in the future phase of this work.  
This paper is formatted in the following order. Section 2 addresses the implementation strategies 
of this code integration as well as the interfaces to interact with the HFSS. Section 3 demonstrates the 
concepts by considering the radiation patterns optimization of a single band and a dual-band horn 
antenna designs for the application of reflector’s feed in the satellite communications. Finally a short 
discussion is presented in section 4 for a conclusion.  
 
2.  Implementation Strategies 
A. General Concepts and the Program Structure: 
 54
Thus the parameters with respect to the antenna operation such as the operational frequency bands 
and radiation analysis are input through the automation program to HFSS. The main body of the 
automation program is composed by four blocks. The “geometry controller” specifies the 
parameters and variables of the antenna structure to be optimized such as the dimensions and 
coordinates of particular geometries in the structure, which are used in the “GA operator” block to 
produce new values for creating new antenna structure with superior performances. The “GA 
operator” implements the GA algorithm. Also the antenna performance with respect to the design 
anticipation is evaluated in the “fitness function” block to justify whether the expectation has been 
reached based on the analysis of “HFSS simulation” block which uses the HFSS as the EM analysis 
tool. If the fitness value meets the prescribed conditions of requirement, we can declare that a 
satisfying design is found. Otherwise, the GA operator will sort designs according to the fitness 
values, then generate new designs as well as new values of the parameters for the next generation 
from superior designs.  
 
B. Generic Algorithm for Antenna Design Optimization (“GA operator” block): 
GA is employed to optimize the antenna structure to meet the prior requirements of the antenna 
operation. It sorts the design according to computed values of the fitness function, and creates new 
designs according to the superior designs from previous generations as illustrated in Figure 2(a). 
For the case shown, there are eight genes (n=8) representing eight antenna design. Each gene 
comprises a set of parameters’ values for an individual antenna design. The genes are created from 
superior parents in attempt to generate even better performance. The values of the fitness function 
are computed for each gene, and compared to justify the superiority of the antenna performance. In 
Figure 2(a) it is assumed that a larger fitness value indicates a superior performance of the antenna 
associated with this gene. The superior genes are retained while the rest are abandoned in the next 
generation. New genes are produced from the superior parent genes (i.e., the superior genes 
retained in the previous generation) based on a roulette wheel parent selection approach. The 
creation of the new genes uses either crossover or mutation methods as illustrated in Figure 2(b). 
The crossover method means that design parameters are swapped between two parent designs, 
while the mutation method implies that a parameter of the parent gene is replaced with a randomly 
generated number. The decision of using either crossover or mutation method is also random. The 
selection of parent designs is done via the roulette wheel method, that is, a superior design is 
assigned to a larger piece in the wheel, which is equivalent to a larger probability density value. 
Therefore, superior parents are more likely to produce more children. In this work, the crossover 
and mutation are performed based on the operations over the binary codes of the parents’ genes. For 
 56
is first performed within the work of this subroutine. The fundamental parameters such as the 
sampled frequencies, radiation patterns and geometries of antenna structures are assigned 
tentatively. This subroutine transforms the values of the parameters into a script file (called 
VBScript file by HFSS [9]) that can be recognized by HFSS, and then passes the parameters to the 
HFSS to perform the EM analysis and compute the radiations patterns of the initial antenna 
structure.  
The selection of the initial antenna structure plays a dominant role for the success of the 
optimization procedure. It should be capable of providing the essential possibility to achieve the 
design goal since the optimization procedure tends to fine tune the values of the antenna’s 
parameters instead of altering the structure dramatically. For example, if equal beamwidth in the 
radiation band is desired, the changes in antenna’s parameters should result in substantial difference 
in radiation patterns for the first few iterations and gradually converge until the optimum design is 
reached. In this case, the GA procedure will tune the parameter values to adjust the radiation 
patterns in an effective fashion until the designated beamwidth features are obtained. 
(2) Interaction with the HFSS by a VBScript file  
Interactions with HFSS are performed by using a VBScript file which can be executed in HFSS.  
The commands and functions within the antenna configuration subroutine that specify the antenna 
structures can be properly identified and transformed into the format recognizable by HFSS. The 
antenna model is then established within the HFSS GUI program. Commands and functions that 
read the antenna radiation data can be similarly established by identifying the commands in the 
HFSS VBScript file, which can be used to compute the fitness functions.  
 
(3) Intervention with HFSS Execution via key-board controlling keys  
The execution of the entire antenna design procedure is performed within the control program. The 
program knows when to call the HFSS for EM analysis, when the HFSS has completed the analysis, 
how to access the antenna radiation data and where to pass the parameters between HFSS and the 
GA operator via the VBScript file and data files. The access of HFSS is performed by simulating 
key-board controlling keys using C-languages commands and ANSI codes [15] for English 
characters. The key-board controlling keys allow one to run the functions of HFSS through its GUI 
program. As examples, the key-board command “Alt-T” and will open an HFSS window pending 
from “Tools” icon to run script commands as shown in Figure 3(a). The input of key “s” from 
keyboard, will open the window for file access from the hard disk to run a script file. Figure 3(b) 
shows the dialog window evoked.  
 58
in consideration for mass production. In this case, 3 corrugations are implemented, and 13 parameters 
associated with depth, width and thickness of the corrugations are employed as the variables to be 
adjusted along the optimization procedure so that the overall radiation patterns can be rotationally 
symmetric along the boresite. Note that 8 bits are employed to each parameter of the antenna 
structure in this case.

radiation patterns of the optimized antenna design, where one has observed almost identical main 
beam patterns at the two principal planes. In particular, the -10 dB beamwidth is 58 degrees as 
required in the design criterions. The values of the optimized parameters are also shown in Table 1 
for comparison. In this design optimization, the analysis of each antenna structure costs 8 minutes of 
CPU time running on  an AMD K8 3000 ( with 1 GB RAM) computer. The overall CPU time is 26.7 
hours for the entire optimization procedure, where approximately 250 antenna structures have been 
analyzed with HFSS. Note that most of the CPU time was spent in evaluating radiation patterns from 
various designs in the population via HFSS while the CPU time spent in performing 
crossover/mutation operations is negligible.

values of horn’s parameters are randomly selected, The initial design in this example follows the 
horn’s theories. As shown in Figure 6(a), this horn exhibits good radiation characteristics except that 
the beamwidths at 20 and 30GHz are not equal to explore full use of the reflector surface. The GA 
algorithm adjusts the dimensions of the corrugations to optimize the radiation patterns at these two 
frequency bands. The radiation patterns at the two principal planes are employed to justify the 
required beamwidth performance. The four sets of patterns were employed to compute the fitness 
function. The fitness function for nth set of genes is defined similarly by

In (5), Gnm,q (q = 1~4) indicates one of the four radiation patterns. In particular, Gnm,1 is selected to the 
one with beamwidth closest to the specification. The computation of (5) intends to minimize the 
differences in the four patterns. ΔGnm =0 if the difference between patterns are all smaller than the 
tolerance threshold. Equation (6) drives the beamwidths of the four patterns close to the required 
beam width.  Similar to the characteristics described in the previous example, a proper design will 
yield a fitness value of one (Fn = 1). Similar to the previous example, 10 genes are employed in each 
generation to determine superior parents and each parameter of the antenna structure is represented 
by 6 bits. These optimization parameters are selected to provide a relatively quick convergence in the 
GA optimization procedure.
