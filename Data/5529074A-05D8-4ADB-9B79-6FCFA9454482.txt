Introduction
It is important to understand what genetic variations could render avian influenza virus
capable of becoming a pandemic strain. Genome-wide comparison of human versus avian
influenza A viruses would reveal the evolutionary similarity /difference between them and thus
provide information for studying the mechanism of influenza viral infection/replication in
different host species. Although many research efforts have focused on the molecular evolution of
specific genes of influenza viruses, comprehensive comparisons among the nucleotide sequences
of all eight genomic segments and among the 11 encoded protein sequences have not been
extensively reported. In this study, we have utilized a number of computational approaches in
finding specific genetic signatures between human and avian influenza A viral genomes. We
subsequently validated the robustness of those found signatures with human and avian protein
sequences downloaded from Influenza Virus Resources at NCBI.
Materials and Methods
Sequences used in this study
To reveal the host-associated amino acid signatures, we have retrieved full genome
sequences (as of August 22, 2005) from the genome browser at Influenza Sequence Database. For
the purpose of differentiating between avian and human influenza viruses, we have excluded
human-isolated avian influenza viruses from human dataset, and examined those sequences
separately. Altogether, we have 95 avian and 306 human influenza viral genomes, henceforth
mentioned“primary dataset”throughout the text. All eleven viral proteins encoded from the eight
genomic RNAs were compared, including PB2, PB1, PB1-F2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS1
and NS2. Human-isolated avian influenza viruses from human flu were separately retrieved from
NCBI as well as from ISD. Altogether we have 417 accessions from 60 avian flu strains, in which
21 strains contain sequences (full or nearly full-length) from all 8 genomic RNAs. For validating
the obtained signatures from analyzing the primary dataset, we have further retrieved 15,785
human or avian influenza A viral protein sequences from NCBI’s Influenza Virus Resources.
GenBank accession numbers
There were 11 Taiwanese genomes produced by the Molecular Virology Laboratory at
Chang Gung University and have been deposited to GenBank with accessions DQ415283 to
DQ415370.
Results
Amino acid residues that differ most between human and avian influenza viruses
We separately calculated an entropy value for 95 avian influenza viruses and for 306 human
influenza viruses investigated, for every aligned amino acid position. We identified those amino
acid residues which are most highly conserved with an entropy value less negative than–0.4
within both the human and avian strains, respectively. We chose this entropy threshold based on
the entropy value–0.379 calculated at position 627 of PB2 for the 95 avian viruses. This widely
A/Thailand/16/2004), and the other one was A/Netherlands/219/03(H7N7), which was isolated
from the fatal human case of pneumonia in the Netherlands.
In order to understand how mutations had accumulated within one specific virus, we
summarized the amino acid changes for 21 of these avian viruses which contained full or nearly
full-length sequence for each segment (Table 3). It was found that 19 out of 21 strains contained
one or more species-associated amino acid changes, and seven of them contained two or more
substitutions, in which A/Netherlands/219/03(H7N7) had the highest count for mutation
accumulation (3 positions). Among these 52“species-associated”signatures, the mutation
combinations at positions PB2 199 and PA 409 were most commonly seen in H5N1 human
isolates from Hong Kong in 1997.
RNA segment 5 encoding NP protein exhibits clear boundary between human and influenza
viruses
Our observation that NP contained the highest number (15 out of 52) for
“species-associated”amino acids suggested that NP might serve as a molecular target for
differentiation between human and avian influenza A viruses. To reveal such host specificity, or
the“genetic boundary”between these two viruses at the nucleotide level, we performed a
pairwise sequence comparison for all eleven ORFs on our 401-genome primary dataset and
produced histograms on their computed pairwise identities (data not shown). We found that HA
and NA genes exhibited considerable sequence disparities between strains, as low as 47%. Also
noted is a wide spectrum of percent identities containing little sequence pairs for these two genes.
For both of these proteins, there are some strains from the same species that can have identities as
low as 50%. However, the ORF of another surface protein, M2 ion channel protein, is relatively
conserved (over 74% identity for viruses across species). The histograms for the polymerase
genes (PB2, PB1, and PA), NP and M1, on the other hand, are much less varied (mostly less than
20% variation). In particular, the NP gene was found to exhibit a fairly clear boundary between
homo and hetero pairs at approximately 86%.
Discussions
The glutamic acid residue at PB2 627, which is commonly seen in avian viruses, restricted
the viral growth in humans and monkeys, but a change to lysine restored the virus replication in
mammalian cells. In this work we have computed for every amino acid position (distributed in 11
known influenza viral ORFs) an entropy value which represents how conserved an amino acid
residue is at that given position. We found the entropy value–0.379 at 627 of PB2 and therefore
used–0.4 as a threshold to discover other amino acid residues which might be the potential
determinants of host-cell tropism. Another 51 positions were found“distinct”or“nearly distinct”
between human and avian viruses by this entropy threshold. The majority of these (40 out of 52)
are located in viral RNPs (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) which are essential for viral replication.
Taubenberger et al. reported ten amino acid residues distinguishing human and avian influenza
viral polymerases. Six of them were also identified in this study. The entropy values of the four
missing ones are found close to the preset threshold (–0.4) too. For example, PB2 567 showed a
human entropy of–0.039 and avian entropy–0.490, PB1 375 with human entropy–0.165 and
analysis, but also contains more species-associated amino acid signatures (15 out of 52) than
other ORFs. In addition to NP, polymerase proteins PB2, PB1 and PA also contain abundant
species-associated signatures. It can be seen from Table 1 that most of the signatures in these viral
RNPs are located on the functional domains related to RNP-RNP interactions that are important
to form replicase/transcriptase complex (3P and NP), suggesting that specific combinations of
polymerase complex and NP would allow an influenza virus to replicate itself efficiently. In
addition to RNA-interacting domains, many“species-associated”amino acid signatures of 3P and
NP are located in regions related to nuclear localization signals (NSL). It has been shown that
influenza viral replication is highly dependent on nuclear function, making it worthwhile in
further examining the roles of those amino acid signatures on nuclear localization of viral RNP in
avian versus human cells. We also noticed that several amino acid signatures in NP are located in
the regions interacting with cellular proteins, such as splicing factor (BAT1/UAP56) or MxA,
which plays certain role on cellular antiviral mechanism. It is not clear what species-specific host
factors may affect influenza viral replication rates. Biological experiments are required for further
understanding the roles of those amino acid residues and related functional domains on the
mechanism of interspecies infection.
PB1-F2 is a novel influenza viral protein translated from alternative initiation of PB1 gene.
PB1-F2 of PR8 (H1N1) has been shown to target to mitochondria and then trigger host cell
apoptosis. Our previous work has found that several strains contain truncated PB1-F2. In this
study, 379 out of 401 PB1 sequences (in the primary dataset) contained PB1-F2 no less than 87
and no longer than 90 amino acids. For the other 22 sequences, two H3N2 strains missed a start
codon; three H3N2 had the translation stopped at 11-aa long; one H9N2 stopped at 8-aa long; five
H1N1 stopped at 57-aa long; and three H9N2 and seven H3N2 stopped at 79-aa long. One H5N1
was found containing extra residues with its PB1-F2 being 101-aa long. We also noted five
“species-associated”signatures on PB1-F2, all of them are within the C-terminal domain which is
important for mitochondria targeting. It will be interesting to further investigate the mitochondria
localization of those PB1-F2 variants and their abilities for triggering apoptosis in cells derived
from different species.
It is difficult to predict how many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting
humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus to become a
pandemic strain. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is by far the only
pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Sixteen out of the 52
“species-associated”positions have residues typical for human strains, while the others remained
as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more
closely related to the avian influenza A virus than other human influenza viruses. From the
analyzed 21 avian viruses isolated from human in this study, we found 19 (90.49%) contain one
or more changes at the“species-associated”sites. Upon examining signature changes from
similarly-sized sets of randomly selected human viruses, randomly selected avian viruses, and
randomly selected viruses (avian plus human), on the other hand, we found 29.41%, 71.43%, and
47.06%, respectively, contain species-associated mutations. Although it is difficult to have a good
prediction about the emergence of a pandemic strain, close monitoring upon how those
species-associated signature positions have changed from bird to human-specific ones would
likely to provide a measurement for the likelihood of such events.
Figure 1(b) Entropy plots for the entire influenza A viral genome. Each lane displays entropy
value distributions of aligned protein sequences for one of the 11 viral proteins, with the upper
half representing 95 avian strains, and the bottom half for 306 human strains. (PB1-F2 contains a
fewer number of strains, as described in Discussions.) Positions completely conserved to a single
residue are shown in a white band, while less conserved ones are shown in various gray shadings.
The averaged entropy for the entire segment is shown to the right of these lanes. Entropy values
are zero when residues are completely conserved, with more negative values indicating more
diversity. Alignment size for each protein from top to bottom is 759, 757, 90, 716, 591, 498, 480,
252, 97, 230 and 121, respectively.
