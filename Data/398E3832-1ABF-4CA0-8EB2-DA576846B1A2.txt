摘要 
 A structure of Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si was first formed and then annealed at various 
temperature for 5 minutes in a rapid thermal annealing furnace with a vacuum of 10-2 torr. 
In Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structure, the ITO(10 nm) film was coated on Si substrate by 
sputtering process and the Cu film was deposited on ITO film by electroplating technique . 
The various Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si samples were characterized by a four-point probe, a 
scanning electron microscope, an x-ray diffractometer, a transmission electron microscope. 
The results showed that when the annealing temperature increases near 600 ℃ the interface 
between Cu and ITO becomes unstable, and the Cu3Si particles begin to form; and when 
the annealing temperature increases to 650 ℃, a good many of Cu3Si particles about 1 μm 
in size form and the sheet resistance of Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structure largely increases.

After dried in N2 stream the substrate was then put in a sputtering deposition chamber 
for coating ITO film. The deposition process was carried out in Ar gas with a working 
pressure of 4×10-3 torr. The power and the deposition time were adjusted so that an ITO 
film 10 nm in thickness can be obtained. 
A Cu film about 200 nm in thickness was deposited on ITO film by electrodeposition 
technique. The deposition bath is one of the simplest in which CuSO4．5H2O(212.5g/L) was 
taken as the Cu2+ ion source and pH value was controlled at 2 by dilute H2SO4 solution. 
The bath temperature and current density were kept at 25 ℃ and 5 A/dm2, respectively, in 
the deposition process. 
 
2.2 Annealing of Cu/ITO/Si samples 
 
A rapid thermal annealing (RTA) furnace was used for the annealing of Cu/ITO/Si 
samples. The annealing was performed at a temperature ranged from 300 to 750 ℃ for 5 
minutes in a vacuum of 10-2 torr. 
 
2.3 Characterization of Cu/ITO/Si samples 
 
The annealed Cu/ITO/Si samples were characterized by a four-point probe for their 
sheet resistances, an X-ray diffractometer (Macscience Co Ltd., MO3X-HF) for their 
phases, a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6360) for their surface 
morphologies, a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) for their 
cross-sectional microstructures, crystal structure, and high resolution image, and an energy 
dispersive spectrometer (EDS) equipped with SEM for their composition. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 annealing of ITO film 
 
It has been demonstrated that the as-deposited ITO film is amorphous [28]. In order to 
improve their crystallinity and increase their electrical conductivity, the ITO films on Si 
were annealed at a temperature of 200, 300, 400, and 500 ℃ for 1 and 5 minutes. Fig.1 
shows the relation between resistance of ITO film and annealing temperature. It can be 
seen that the resistance of ITO film decreases from 2.15×10-3 Ω-cm of the as-deposited film 
to about 0.25×10-3Ω-cm of the film annealed at a temperature of 300, 400, and 500 ℃ for 1 
and 5 minutes. Therefore, all the ITO films on Si were annealed at 300 ℃ for 5 minutes 
under a vacuum of 10-2 torr in a RTA furnace before Cu was electroplated on their surface. 
A TEM high resolution image of an ITO film on Si annealed at 300 ℃ for 5 minutes is 
 
The relation of sheet resistance versus annealing temperature for Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si 
samples annealed for 5 minutes in a RTA furnace with a vacuum of 10-2 torr is plotted in 
Fig.3. The sheet resistance of Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si samples keeps about 0.2 Ω/sq. until the 
annealing temperature is higher than 600 ℃, and increases rapidly as the annealing 
temperature is higher than 650 ℃.

as-deposited state and annealed for 5 minutes in a vacuum of 10-2 torr at 300~750 ℃. The 
peaks of Cu(111) and Cu(200) emerge in all XRD patterns of samples, and become more 
intensive and narrow until the annealing temperature increases. To 600 ℃ this displays that 
the size of Cu grains in Cu film increases with the increase of the annealing temperature. 
The peaks of Cu3Si (012) and Cu3Si (300) appear in XRD patterns of samples annealed at 
650, 700 and 750 ℃, and become more intensive as the annealing temperature increases. 
This means that the amount of Cu3Si phase increases when the annealing temperature 
increases from 650 ℃, through 700 ℃, to 750 ℃. At the same time, the intensity of Cu 
(111) and Cu (200) peaks decreases with the increase of annealing temperature from 650 to 
750 ℃. This demonstrates that the amount of Cu metal decreases as the amount of Cu3Si 
phase increases due to the formation of Cu3Si phase at 650~750 ℃.

Fig.6 shows the TEM cross-sectional views of Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si samples (a) at the 
as-deposited state, and annealed for 5 minutes in a RTA furnace with a vacuum of 10-2 torr 
at (b)400, (c)600 and (d)700 ℃. It can be seen that the ITO films in Fig.6 (a) and (b) lie 
quite flatly between Si and Cu, and the thickness of the ITO film in Cu/ITO (10 nm)/Si 
particles about 1 μm in size would form and the sheet resistance of Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si 
structure then increases largely.
