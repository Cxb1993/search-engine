et al., 2006; Ravikanth et al., 2007] and finger-to-finger seam recognition [Zheng et al., 2007] are 
new approach to recognize hands. In the previous research, palm-prints [Han et al., 2004], iris, 
fingerprints, facial features, and vein patterns [Lin et al., 2004] were also used to identify 
different individuals. Vein patterns [Lin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2007] are 
susceptible to body temperature and are unreliable to identify the hands. 
In this study, the new technique [Su, 2003] is used to extract: thumb, index, middle, ring, and 
small fingers and to perform finger identification. The geometrical descriptor is used to transfer 
geometrical features of the finger to another feature domain for image comparison. For reducing 
the number of files in the system, all the fingers of one person are placed in one file. Image 
subtraction is used to examine the difference of the two fingers. The hand is fixed each time when 
photographing and it is assumed that each time when the hand image is taken, it presents the 
same shape as the previous acquired ones; subsequently, after the fingers are extracted, they can 
be used to identify different persons. This report consists of four sections. Section 2 acquires the 
hand image; section 3 extracts the finger images; section 4 describes the geometrical descriptor 
and image subtraction. section 5 concludes this report. 
 
2. Acquiring hand image. 
 
Figure 2.1 shows the acquired hand images. After further processing, one can obtain the 
hand-edge images. The hand-edge images are shown in figure 2.2. Figure 2.3 shows the geometry 
features of the hand image. By the edge thinning direction and the hand geometry features, one 
can extract the fingertips and finger-valleys. The results are shown in figure 2.4.

taken for each group. To each group, one hundred and five comparisons are conducted to find the 
accurate-identification-rate of the developed identification algorithm. Within those one hundred 
and five comparisons, fifteen comparisons are conducted for self-comparison – since one person 
taken three different photos. The data of these fifteen comparisons are shown inside the 
rectangular boxes. The other ninety comparisons are conducted for comparisons between two 
different sources. Figure 5.1 shows parts of the data. The comparisons of the same person’s finger 
images yield much less values; however, the comparisons of the different person’s finger images 
yield much greater values. For the first group test, the error rate for the index finger is 22%, the 
middle finger is 9%, and the ring finger is 11%. For the second group, the error rate for the index 
finger is 35%, the middle finger is 29%, and the ring finger is 15%.

Fig. 2 Obtain the thinned-edges

Extract the finger images
Figure 1 shows the shelves for taking the hand-images. The
illuminations are from the left lateral and the bottom of the
shelves. By adjusting the lights one can control the illumina-
tions to the hand-image. In the middle shelf, several pegs are
used to peg the person’s hand to a certain position. This will
make the hand inertial when the hand-image is taken. Figure 2
shows the hand images and the extracted hand-edge images.
Figure 3 shows the position-features of the fingertips and fin-
ger-to-finger-valleys. By using these position-features, one
can extract the entire—thumb, index, middle, ring, and small
fingers. The entire images are shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6. The
finger extracting technique is shown in reference Su (2003).
Geometry descriptor
For every pixel (i, j) in the object, after the transformation
of the geometry descriptor, the final destination of (i, j) is
(i f , j f ). The geometry descriptor will transfer and interpo-
late the geometry features of every pixel inside the object
to another feature-domain. The original geometry feature of
the finger image will be preserved, after the object is trans-
fer to the new feature-domain. In the new feature-domain,
every object will have the same straight orientation and every
object’s centroid is aligned to position (64, 64). Since every
Fig. 3 Features of the fingertips and finger-to-finger-valleys
object has the same orientation and every object is aligned
to the same centroid, one can perform the image subtrac-
tion to perform the person’s identification. Equation 1 shows
the function of the geometry descriptor. In Eq. 1, “θ” repre-
sents the object’s orientation and “Centroid” represents the
object’s centroid. By using Eqs. 2–4, one can find the param-
eter θ . In Eqs. 2 and 3, idistance represents the i—distance
of a specific pixel g(i, j) to the object’s centroid, jdistance
represents the j—distance of a specific pixel g(i, j) to the
object’s centroid, and Weighti j represents the weight of a
specific pixel g(i, j).

Hybrid geometry signals and image subtraction
Figures 12 and 13 show the hybrid geometry signals. The
hybrid geometry signals are the composed signals of—the
thumb, index, middle, ring, and small fingers. The signals
of—the thumb, index, middle, ring, and small fingers are
added together to generate the hybrid geometry signals. Since
the separate finger cannot perform well to perform the per-
son’s identification, the hybrid geometry signals would pos-
sess more fingers’ geometry features to perform the person’s
identification. Finger 14 shows the various hybrid geometry
signals. As mentioned earlier, because of the illumination and
the fingers stretch at different positions, one cannot precisely
extract the fingertip and finger-root. For coping these errors,
the images are fine-tuning to different positions to obtain the
better recognition rate—during the image subtraction stage.

Fig. 16 Sub-pattern template convolution to find the minimum pixel
value
First, the image is shifted at different positions—to which
are—left four pixels, left three pixels, left two pixels, . . .
etc, right four pixels. Also, the image is shifted—top four
pixels, top three pixels, top two pixels, . . . etc, bottom four
pixels. When the images are fine-tuning to one certain po-
sition, the image is also fine-tuning to different orientations
for comparison. The rotated degrees are—counter-clockwise
2 degrees, counter-clockwise 0.8 degrees, counter-clockwise
0.6 degrees, . . .etc, to clockwise 1.8 degrees. Figure 15 shows
the rotated-images, which are rotated from −2.0 degrees to
+1.8 degrees.
After the image rotation, the software will perform the im-
age subtraction. The image subtractions are shown in
Figs. 16 and 17 In the top of Fig. 16, one can find a 5 by 5 sub-
pattern template. This 5 by 5 sub-pattern template will extract
the sub-pattern images of two persons’ geometry hybrid sig-
nals and, consequently, the image convolution is performed
to these two 5 by 5 sub-pattern template images. Fine-tuning
of the image is also performed in this stage and the min-
imum value of the convolution results will be recorded in
the resultant-image. The subtract result image is shown in
the right-hand side picture of Fig. 16. By calculating the
difference of the subtracted-result, one can recognize differ-
ent fingers.
Results and conclusions
In Fig. 17, one can find the original hand-edge images and
the hybrid finger geometry signals. The image subtraction
is performed to the hybrid finger geometry signals and the
results are shown in the right-hand side pictures of the Fig.
17. Figure 17 also shows the value of the difference of the
two subtracted-images. Figure 17 shows four different cases
of image subtractions. All these four cases involve the im-
age subtraction of one person’s hand-image subtracting to
the same person another hand-image. After performing the
image subtraction, the differences of these four cases are—
886850, 825250, 763852, and 834800. Figures 18 and 19
show the partial comparison data of the image difference after
performing the image subtraction. The data inside the rectan-
gular boxes in Figs. 18 and 19 are the image subtraction-result
of one person’s hand-image subtracting to the same person’s
another hand image. The other data, which is not circled
by the rectangular boxes, show the difference between two
different persons’ hand images subtractions. In Fig. 20, one
can find that the error range of the subtracted value of differ-
ent person comparison are 834725–674625. When conduct-
ing one person’s hand-image subtracting to the same person
another hand-image, the error range of the subtracted-value
are 1135550– 834800. In this research, 57 persons’ hand
images are taken. Each person takes three different hand im-
ages. As shown in Fig. 1, the illuminations are adjusted to
provide different illuminations to each hand image. After the
hand images are taken, several problems are found in the
hand images—the middle finger and the ring finger of sev-
eral people hands are stick together or the thumb finger of one
person’s hand-image are stretching too wide. The algorithm
developed in this research cannot correctly extract the middle
and ring fingers correctly when the middle and ring fingers
are sticking together and the algorithm will not extract the
wider-stretched thumb finger either. Since these two prob-
lems will cause the algorithm unable to extract the thumb,
middle, and ring fingers correctly, several images are dis-
carded from the test. Actually, the hand-photo-images used
in this system are only 120, which are belonged to 40 persons.
Regard these 120 photos as whole and run these 120 pho-
tos in one batch—which will take a very long time to get
the job done. Due to the software glitch, the running process
might break before the job completed. Consequently, one
might endlessly run and run the procedure again and again
and every time from the square one. Furthermore, the data-
base might have no enough memory to accommodate the
entire obtained-data. Thus, in this system, five persons are
designated as one group, i.e., five people are regarded as a
group and these five persons are tested in one step. Since one
person has been taken three different photos, totally 15 photos
are tested in each step. As mentioned earlier, in this system,
there are 40 persons participating the test. Thus, the system
totally will run eight different batches. Totally, 120 hand-
photos are tested. For each hand-photo-image, the following
steps are performed (1) the hand-edge is found, (2) the fin-
gers are extracted separately, (3) geometry descriptor is per-
formed to each finger, (4) mixed-finger-signal is generated,
(5) image shifting and rotation are performed, (6) genuine
and imposter comparisons are conducted. To each group, one
photo is compared against the other 14 photos. Totally, 105
comparisons are conducted to test the accuracy of the devel-
oped identification algorithm. Within those 105 comparisons,
15 comparisons are conducted for genuine-comparison, the
comparisons of the same person’s fingers — since one person
taken three different photos. The other ninety comparisons
are conducted for imposter-comparisons — the comparisons
of different person’s fingers. In this research, there are eight
different test batches. Thus, there are 120 genuine tests and
720 imposter tests. Figure 21 shows the comparison results

Abstract. This research uses the object extracting technique to extract the index, middle and ring
fingers from the hand images. The algorithm developed in this research can find the precise
locations of the different fingers’ fingertips and the finger-to-finger-valleys. After finding the
positions of the fingertips and finger-valleys, the index, middle and ring fingers can be extracted
from the hand images by using morphological technique. The extracted index, middle and ring
fingers contain many useful geometry features. One can use these features to do the person’s
identification. The orientations of the index, middle and ring fingers are found in this research.
Image rotating, image shifting, and image interpolating techniques are used to align different
persons’ index, middle and ring fingers. Image subtraction is used to exam the difference of two
index, middle and ring finger images. In this research so far only use the index, middle and the ring
fingers as the features to identify different persons.
Key words: dilating, finger shape extraction, finger shape identification, morphology, object curve
comparison.
1. Introduction
In the past 20 years, researchers invested a lot of effort to develop different
techniques to identify the hand images. This past work includes Y hand geometry
[2, 5, 12, 16], middle finger crease pattern matching [6], various finger size
measurements [7, 14], various finger lateral view size measurements [14], vein
pattern [9], eigenpalm [10], implicit polynomials [13], algebraic invariants [13],
Karen invariant computation [13], line interception and slope comparisons [17],
control point selection [8, 17], coarse to fine strategy [3], B-Spline [11], wa-
tershed transform [9], HMM [16]; However, some are very sensitive to the noise
[6, 17]; some have very complicated mathematical models [13] and some have
very complicated neural training algorithms. In this research, the new technique
is used to extract the index, middle and the ring fingers to do the person’s
identification. The orientations of the index, middle and ring fingers are cal-

are fixed with interval of five pixels. When A is moved, the distance BC between
points B and C is calculated. Consequently, various distances BC of points B
and C will be found. By checking the center picture in Figure 1, one can
find the distances BC are less than 13 Y since A is located in the positions around
the finger-to-finger-valley. Various distances BC are compared; the point A with
the minimum distance of BC will represent the index-middle-fingers-valley. The
center and right-hand-side pictures in Figure 1 are extracted from Microsoft
Access database. The center picture shows how to find the index-middle-fingers-
valley. The right-hand-side picture shows how to find the middle-ring-fingers-
valley.
In this research, the finger-ends are used to identify different persons. Figure 2
shows by using the finger root Y (i.e., finger-to-finger-valley) as the beginning
searching point and performing the bottomYup searching, one can obtain the dif-
ferent fingers’ finger-ends. When the algorithm performs the bottom-up searching
and when the algorithm detects the straight finger edge, the algorithm will mark
this point as the extracting point Y which late the algorithm will use this point to
extract finger-ends. In this research, when the distance BC is the greater than 20,
the algorithm will mark this point as the beginning point of the straight-finger-
edge. As contrast to Figure 1, one can find that when the finger edge is straight,
the distances BC between points B and C would be greater than those distances
of BC Y when A is located in the positions of the bending finger edge in
Figure 1. The center and right-hand-side pictures in Figure 2 are also extracted
from the Microsoft Access database. By using the beginning points, which are
Figure 2. Find the beginning points with straight finger edges.
FINGER IMAGE EXTRACTION BY MORPHOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE AND FINGER IMAGE 3
The extracted middle finger images are shown in Figures 5Y7, respectively. Di-
lating circles with radii 2, 3, and 4 generate the results of Figures 5Y7, re-
spectively. The error rates for Figures 5Y7 are 4.7%, 2.8%, and 4.7%. The error
rates are calculated by using the misidentification cases divided by the total test
cases. Since the dilating circle with radius 3 generates more accurate result, the
circle with radius 3 is used in this research to extract the original finger images.

the second group, the error rate for the original middle finger is 2.8%, the
original ring finger is 5.7%, and the original index finger is 1.9%. In the previous
research [15], the middle, ring, and index finger edges are extracted from
different persons for conduct the persons’ identification too. The subtracted-re-
sults of the middle, ring, and index finger edges are shown in Figures 13Y15,

By the experimental test, one can conclude that the original finger images
extracted by the dilated finger edges will produce the more accurate identification
rates.
4. Fine-tuning the Extracted Images to Increase the
Identification-Accuracy-rates and Speed Up the
Identification Process
For one specific person, one should expect one unique shape of the finger image
is extracted from the person’s different hand photos. However, the illumination

the topYbottom position shifting are top two pixel, top one pixel, no move,
bottom one pixel, and bottom two pixels. The shifting positions are shown in
Figure 16.
When the images are shifted at one certain position, the image is also rotated
to different orientations for comparison. The rotated degrees are counter-clock-
wise 2-, counter-clock-wise 0.8-, counter-clock-wise 0.6-. . . clock-wise 1.8-. The
image rotating figures are shown in Figure 17. After this fine-tuning, the
misidentification rate is drop from 30% to 20%, for the pure thinned middle
finger edge test in Figure 13.
As mentioned in Section 3, in this research, totally 10 persons participate
in the experimental test. In each group, totally 15 photos are taken. For each
group, totally 105 comparisons are required for each photo to be compared to the
other 14 remaining photos. Figure 18(a) shows 225 comparisons, which contains
120 trivial comparisons Y (since C2
15 is equal to 105). Figure 18(b) shows the
essential 105 comparisons. The algorithm, developed in this research, only
perform the 105 essential comparisons and the other non-essential comparisons
are skipped.
As checking Figure 19(a), one can find that the extracted middle finger image
only occupies a small portion of the image. In order to speed up the comparison
process, the algorithm only needs to compare the useful image to identify the
person. The useful image range Y Imin, Imax, Jmin, and Jmax are found in this
research and are saved in the end of the image’s original BMP file. The content
of the BMP file with saved Y Imin, Imax, Jmin, and Jmax is shown in Figure 19(b).

respectively, the algorithm will locate the beginning points, which begin with the
straight-finger-edges. The picture is shown in Figure 21(b). By further pro-
cessing, the point with minimum distance near the thumb-index-fingers-valley
will be located. This point will be treated as the thumb-index-fingers-valley. The
result is shown in Figure 21(c).
6. Results and Conclusions
As mentioned in Section 3, the original finger images extracted by the dilated
finger edges will produce more accurate results than the pure thinned finger
edges. If one can more effectively control the zoom-in and zoom-out effect of the
camera lens and if one also can control the illumination well when one person’s
hand image is taken, the algorithm might reduce the misidentification error to
below 2%. In order to cope the above lens and illumination problems, one might
consider the 3-D laser scanner to acquire the hand images.

between (ky+q and kyq) too. In Eq. (2.1), knq represents
the (n  q)th pixel residing in the obtained palm’s edge
image. The variable n varies from 1 to palm-edge-total-pix-
els subtracting q. The response energy Energy(kn) is
weighted by the distance of the two points knq and kn+q.
As one can see from Fig. 4, one can ﬁnd Energy(kn) will
Fig. 4. Show the positions of various feature points.have the less values in the ﬁngertip or the ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger
valley areas. In the straight-line area of the ﬁnger edge,
Energy(kn) will have the greater values. In this research,
q is set to 10. By this concept, one can extract the entire ﬁn-
gertips and ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger-valleys. Furthermore, one can
extract the entire ﬁngers. Since the ﬁngertip and the ﬁn-
ger-roots might cause some errors during the ﬁnger-recog-
nition process, the ﬁngertips and ﬁnger-roots are taken out.
The ﬁnal ﬁnger images are shown in Fig. 5. In the previous
research, the wavelet transform (Han, 2004; Han et al.,
2003) is used to ﬁnd the positions of ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger-val-
leys. This paper purposed method work more eﬃciently
and correctly to ﬁnd the position of the ﬁngertips and ﬁn-
ger-to-ﬁnger-valleys.
Fig. 5. The hand image antion of the geometry descriptor, the ﬁnal destination of
(i, j) is (if, jf). The geometry descriptor will transfer and
interpolate the geometry features of every pixel inside the
object to another feature-domain. The original geometry
feature of the ﬁnger image will be preserved, after the
object is transfer to the new feature-domain. In the new
feature-domain, every object will have the same straight
orientation and every object’s centroid is aligned to posi-
tion (64,64). Since every object has the same orientation
and every object is aligned to the same centroid, one can
perform the image subtraction to perform the person’s
identiﬁcation. Eq. (3.1) shows the function of the geometry
descriptor. In Eq. (3.1), ‘‘h’’ represents the object’s orienta-
tion and ‘‘Centroid’’ represents the object’s centroid. By
using Eqs. (3.2)–(3.4), one can ﬁnd the parameter h. In
Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3), idistance represents the i-distance of a
speciﬁc pixel g(i, j) to the object’s centroid, jdistance repre-
sents the j-distance of a speciﬁc pixel g(i, j) to the object’s
centroid, and Weightij represents the weight of a speciﬁc
pixel g(i, j). The images in the second row of Fig. 6 shows
the resultant images after the geometry descriptor is
applied to the ﬁnger images. During the image-comparison
stage, to allow the ﬁnger geometry to possess more salient
feature, the ﬁngers are scaled to various sizes. The images
are shown in the third row of Fig. 6.
In this research, in order to allow the ﬁnger geometry to
possess more salient feature when performing the ﬁnger
image-comparison, the ﬁngers are also magniﬁed to vari-
ous images. The images are named ‘‘distance-weighted-
images’’. One can obtain the ‘‘magniﬁed ﬁnger-image’’ by
processing the ﬁnger images by the following steps:
Assume one existing pixel T, T 2 ﬁnger image, and
assume f(i, j) is the gray level of point (i, j), and also assume
f(i, j) 2 ﬁnger image. One use the symbol kT  f(i, j)k to
represent the distance between point T and point (i, j)
and one denote the distance as d. The construction ofd the extracted ﬁngers.

20, counter-clockwise 15, counter-clockwise 10, coun-
ter-clockwise 5, etc., to clock-wise 20. Fig. 13 shows the
rotated-images, which are rotated from 5 to +5.
As mentioned earlier, for reducing the number of ﬁles in
the system, one person’s entire ﬁnger images are placed in
one ﬁle to perform the process of the image shifting and
image-rotation. After the image shifting and rotation, the
individual ﬁnger image needs to be extracted from the
hybrid geometry signal separately to perform the pattern
recognition. The hybrid geometry signals and the extracted
ﬁnger images are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. After obtaining
the individual ﬁnger image, one can perform the image sub-
traction to the ﬁnger images and to perform the pattern
recognition. The image subtractions are shown in Figs.
16–19. In the top of Fig. 16, one can ﬁnd a 5 by 5 sub-pat-
tern-template. This 5 by 5 sub-pattern-template will extract
the sub-pattern images of two persons’ hand geometry sig-
nals and, consequently, the image convolution is performed
to the 5 by 5 sub-pattern-template images. Image-ﬁne-tun-
ing is also performed in this stage and the minimum value
of the convolution results will be recorded in the resultant-
image. The subtract result image is shown in the right-hand
side picture of Fig. 16. By calculating the diﬀerence of the

is shifted – top four pixels, top three pixels, top two pixels,
etc., to bottom four pixels. The picture is shown in Fig. 12.
When the images are ﬁne-tuning to one certain position,
the image is also ﬁne-tuning to diﬀerent orientations forFig. 9. The results of the ﬁnger images after performing the gsubtracted-result, one can recognize diﬀerent persons. In

1. Introduction
During the past 20 years, researchers invested a lot of eﬀort to develop diﬀerent techniques to identify hand
images. This past work includes hand geometry [1,2,4,5,12,15–18], middle ﬁnger crease pattern matching [6],
various ﬁnger size measurements [7,14], various ﬁnger lateral view size measurements [14], vein pattern [9],Department of Industrial Engineering and Technology Management, Da Yeh University, 112 Shan-Jeau Road,

Abstract
In this research, a new technique is used to extract the thumb, index, middle, ring, and small ﬁngers and to perform a
person’s identiﬁcation. To allow the ﬁnger geometry to be more salient when performing the ﬁnger image comparison, the
ﬁngers are scaled to various sizes. For reducing the number of ﬁnger-image-ﬁles in the system, a person’s entire ﬁnger-
images are placed in one ﬁle. The hand is ﬁxed each time when a picture is taken and one can assume that each time when
the hand image is taken, the acquired ﬁnger images are the same as the previously acquired ones. Since the pictures are the
same, after the ﬁngers are extracted from the hand image, one can use the acquired ﬁngers to identify diﬀerent people. In
this research, the developed algorithm of the auto-registration technique can ﬁnd the precise location of the ﬁnger image –
including the centroid of the ﬁnger image and the orientation of the ﬁnger image. The ﬁnding of the position and the ori-
entation of the ﬁnger image are conducted automatically and without any further human eﬀort. After ﬁnding the positions
of the ﬁnger images, image rotating, image shifting, and image interpolating techniques are used to align diﬀerent ﬁnger
images to the same position and the same orientation for comparison. The extracted ﬁnger image contains many useful
geometrical features. One can use these features to do ﬁnger image identiﬁcation. Since the entire ﬁnger images are aligned
to the same position and the same orientation, the image phase-matching technique is used to examine the diﬀerence
between two ﬁnger images. The image phase-matching technique involves complex number manipulation and also ﬁndsFinger extraction, ﬁnger image automatic registration,
and ﬁnger identiﬁcation by image phase matching qdoi:10.1016/j.amc.2006.10.074

916 C.-L. Su / Applied Mathematics and Computation 188 (2007) 912–923The images in the third row of Fig. 3.1 show the resultant images after the geometry descriptor is perform
to the ﬁnger images. To allow the ﬁnger geometry to possess more salient features when performing the ﬁnger
image comparison, the ﬁngers are scaled to various sizes. The images are shown in the fourth row of Fig. 3.1.
Fig. 3.2 shows the overlapped geometry signals. The overlapped geometry signals are the overlapped signals
of the palm, thumb, index, middle, ring, and small ﬁngers; i.e. the signals of the palm, thumb, index, middle,
ring, and small ﬁngers are added together to generate the overlapped geometry signals. Since one ﬁnger-image
needs one ﬁle to record the ﬁnger image, more ﬁnger-images need more ﬁles to record these ﬁnger-images. In
this overlapped scheme, several ﬁngers’ images are recorded in one ﬁle. Since several ﬁnger images are

of the ﬁles is reduced, the system complexity is reduced when performing the person identiﬁcation. Fig. 3.3
shows the various overlapped geometry signals.

4. Image phase matching
Eq. (4.1) shows the function which transfers the function f(x,y) to function F(u,v) and Eq. (4.2) shows the
function which transfers the function g(x,y) to function G(u,v). Fig. 4.1 shows the various f(x,y) and its
corresponding F(u,v) images. Eq. (4.3) shows the relationship of image phase matching between – F(u,v),
conjugated G(u,v), f(x,y), and g(x,y). Symbol  represents the image phase matching. Fig. 4.2 shows the phase-
matching images of the two images f(x,y) and g(x,y). By checking Fig. 4.2, one can ﬁnd that by using the
image phase-matching technique, one can correctly identify the position of g(x,y). Fig. 4.3 shows the various
phase-matching images which are generated by the images f(x,y) and g(x,y). The top image is the palm image,
the center image is the thumb image, and the bottom image is the index ﬁnger image. The algorithm developed
in this research will examine the most salient pixel in the phase-matching image in Fig. 4.3 to identify whether
or not image f(x,y) and image g(x,y) are the same images. Fig. 4.4 shows the extracted palm images and the
phase-matching images of the two extracted palm images, Fig. 4.5 shows the extracted thumb images and the
phase-matching images of the two extracted thumb images, and Fig. 4.6 shows the extracted index ﬁnger
images and the phase-matching images of the two extracted index ﬁnger images. As mentioned before, the
algorithm developed in this research will identify the most salient pixel of the phase-matching image to identify
whether or not image f(x,y) and image g(x,y) are the same images.

are designated as one group, i.e. ﬁve people are regarded as a group and these ﬁve persons are tested in one
step. Since one person has three diﬀerent hand images being taken, totally 15 hand images are tested in each
step. As mentioned earlier, in this system, there are 40 persons participating in the test. Thus, the system will

一、 參加會議經過 
VISAPP is organized by INSTICC - Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and 
Communication. This international conference is a very big international computer vision event. It takes 
four days to complete this conference and it covers another computer vision workshop and it also covers 
several computer vision related workshops. Several important keynote speakers address their research 
interesting in this event.  
This is a very huge international conference. There are about 1000 speakers from the world attend this 
conference.  
 
二、 與會心得 
I am very glad to join this conference. I talked with many scientists, who were coming from different 
countries. Many interesting papers are presented in this conference and I came out the following idea 
after I attended this conference:  
 
1. One PhD student from Swiss, University of Geneva, presented the eye assistance device for the blind 
people.  A red line is paved in the road and a detecting device is stalled in the head of a blind 
person to detect the red line. Various sounds can be heard depending on how far the distances between 
the blind person and the red line. 
2. One keynote speaker presented how to generate the pictures of the animation film by using computer 
graphic technique and he mentioned it is a challenge job of how to mimic the face expression and 
the wrinkle of the skin. He also mentioned it took a very long time to produce one picture of one
