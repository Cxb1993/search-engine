The thermo-electro-structural coupled-field 
analyses will be solved. In the two-dimensional 
study, the plane stress condition is coupled with the 
thermo-electric plane problem. Linear elastic and 
isotropic properties are assumed. To simulate the 
more practical conditions, the temperature- 
dependent material constants and other data in Table 
1 [10] are adopted in the numerical model. The 
softening property of the material at high 
temperature is expressed by temperature-dependent 
Young’s modulus in Table 1.  
The phase change between liquid and solid 
states can be considered to analyze the melting crack 
tip. It is required to use the enthalpy values to 
simulate the phase change process in ANSYS [9]. 
The enthalpy values h of the mild steel with different 
temperature are shown in Fig. 2. 
The external current I0 can be the alternating 
current (AC) or direct current (DC). When the AC is 
used, the function of I0(t) is    
   
)2sin()(0 ftItI A π=  (1) 
 
where t, IA and f are the time, amplitude and 
frequency, respectively. However, a constant value 
of I0 is used to simulate the DC. 
Contact conditions between both crack 
surfaces are considered in this study. The electric 
current and heat flow can pass through the crack 
surfaces when the crack contact occurs. The crack 
contact may be induced by the compressive load or 
thermal deformation along the crack faces. 
Because of the complicated multi-physical 
nature as mentioned above, the thermo-electro- 
structural coupled analyses with ANSYS are used 
for this problem. Under the thermo-electric Joule 
heating, the current-induced thermoelastic problem 
is transient.    
From the results of finite element analyses, the 
temperature, melting size and electric current density 
factor at the crack tip will be obtained for estimating 
the crack tip behaviors. In addition, the stress field, 
temperature field, deformation and crack opening 
displacement will also be obtained for discussions. 
 
3. Methods of analyses    
 
3.1.  Coupled-field analysis

where U, T, V, F, Q and I are the vector forms of 
the displacement (m), temperature (ºC), electric 
potential (V), force (N), heat flow rate (W) and 
electric current (A), respectively. The material 
constant matrices M, C, Ct, Ctu, K, Kt, Kut and Kv 
are the structural mass, structural damping, thermal 
specific heat, thermoelastic damping, structural 
stiffness, thermal conductivity, thermoelastic 
stiffness and electric conductivity, respectively. The 
coupled heat flow matrix Q contains effects of the 
thermal loading and electrical Joule heating. Ctu and 
Kut  are thermoelastic coupled terms. Eq. (2) is a 
directly coupled nonlinear equation. The Newton- 
Raphson iterative method is used to solve it. Eq. (2) 
will be solved by the finite element software 
ANSYS [9].  
 
3.2.  Boundary conditions and initial conditions 
 
Boundary and initial conditions in this study 
are listed as follows:  
 
)(),,( 0 tJtLxJ =− , 0),,( =tLxφ , Wx ≤  (3) 
0),,(),,( σσσ =−= tLxtLx yyyy ,  Wx ≤  (4) 
0)0,,( TyxT =  ,  C210 °=T  (5) 
0)0,,()0,,()0,,( === yxuyxuyxu iii &&&  (6) 
 
where )2/()()( 00 WetItJ = . Because the time span 
is relatively short in the transient thermal analysis, 
four edges of the plate are assumed as adiabatic [11]. 
On the crack surfaces (−a<x<a, y=0), the electrical- 
thermal-mechanical contact conditions with contact 
parameters will be used in numerical simulations. 
 
3.3.  Finite element mesh 
 
The finite element meshes of the previous 
study [8] are adopted in this paper. The accuracy of 
the mesh has been validated in [8]. In Fig. 3, it 
shows a finite element mesh of ANSYS with 
W=L=0.1 m and a=0.01 m. Due to the symmetry, 
only half plate of Fig. 1 is analyzed and the 
symmetrical conditions are applied. The plate is 
modeled by ANSYS element type: PLANE223, i.e. 
the 8-node plane isoparametric element with the 
thermo-electro-structural coupled-field analysis.

when a/W and IA are larger. Under IA= 26000 A, the 
melting size is zero in the range a/W ≤ 0.2. It is 
concluded that the crack tip cannot melt when the 
crack length relative to the plate width is too small.  
     
4.5.  Results of electric current density factor    
 
The same plate dimensions as Section 4.2 are 
considered. The 60 Hz AC with IA=29000 A is 
applied for five cycles. In this case, there is no 
mechanical load. The result in Fig. 10 shows the 
variation of the electric current density factor KJ 
versus time. Positive and negative values of KJ 
imply the opposite directions of the external current. 
The curve in Fig. 10 is similar to the sine wave of Eq. 
(1), but the peak amplitude of KJ fluctuates with time. 
In five cycles, the peak amplitude decays first and 
then increases after t=0.0458 s. According to 
complicated results in Fig. 10, a regular relationship 
between KJ and crack tip temperature cannot be 
found.  
The electric current density factor KJ cannot be 
used to estimate the crack tip temperature and 
melting behavior. The practical and complicated 
results are obtained when the temperature-dependent 
resistivity is adopted in the analysis. If the simplified 
(temperature-independent) material constants are 
used, it will lead to wrong results. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
The finite element modeling and numerical 
analyses of the melting crack tip in a conductive 
plate under the Joule heating have been finished in 
this paper. The AC input is controlled to investigate 
the melting crack tip and associated phenomena.   
To find the practical and correct results, it is 
necessary to consider the AC input, temperature- 
dependent material constants and crack contact 
condition in the finite element simulations. However, 
the phase change effect can be ignored in the 
analysis due to its small error.  
Due to the electric current density 
concentration and thermo-electric Joule heating, the 
crack tip can melt when the electric energy is 
provided enough. The tensile load makes the crack 
open and helps the crack tip melt easily. Larger 
melting size is obtained when a/W and IA are larger. 
It is concluded that the crack tip cannot melt when 
the crack length relative to the plate width is too 
small. 
Finally, this paper shows that the electric 
current density factor KJ cannot be used to estimate 
the crack tip temperature and melting behavior. The 
practical and complicated results are obtained when 
the temperature-dependent resistivity is adopted in 
the analysis. If the simplified material constants are 
used, it will lead to wrong results.
