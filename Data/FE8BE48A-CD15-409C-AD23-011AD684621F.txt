2performance. In this paper, the use of bit-interleaving
is investigated.
It is well known that bit-interleaving process
disperses consecutive error bits caused by a noisy
M-ary modulation symbol and thus, makes the errors
more correctable. However, whether bit-interleaving
process improves the performance of fast FH/SSMA
systems with M-FSK modulation remains to be
clarified. In this paper, convolutional codes with
soft-decision decoding are considered. Theoretical
upper bounds on bit error rates show that
bit-interleaving induces two counter-acting forces on
the decoder performance. On the one hand,
bit-interleaving increases the free distances of codes
and thus, steepens the bit error rate curve. On the other
hand, it causes the loss of bit dependency information,
which results in decoder performance degradation.
The theoretical and numerical results further show that
the performance degradation caused by information
loss exceeds the performance improvement gained by
free distance increment. Thus, convolutional codes
without bit-interleaving greatly outperform those with
bit-interleaving. Finally, we find that convolutional
codes without bit-interleaving provide significant
performance improvement over RS codes with
hard-decision decoding.
3、SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL
The fast FH/SSMA systems considered here are
similar to those in [6]. In these systems, U transmitters
and U receivers are connected in a pairwise topology.
Each transmitter communicates with its receiver using
error-correcting codes and fast frequency-hopping
with L-fold diversity and M-FSK. In this paper, we
focus on convolutional codes with soft-decision
decoding for error correction.
At the transmitters, each data sequence is
encoded by error-correcting codes and then
bit-interleaved or symbol-interleaved to form a packet.
Here, bit-interleaving means that binary coded
sequences are first randomly interleaved and then
mapped into sequences of M-ary symbols, while
symbol-interleaving means that binary coded
sequences are first mapped into sequences of M-ary
symbols and then randomly interleaved. Each M-ary
symbol is transmitted using L chips. Let Ts and Tc be
the symbol interval and the chip interval, respectively.
Then, Tc = Ts / L. During each chip interval Tc, each
transmitter selects and transmits the tone
amx  (1)
in M-FSK based on the incoming coded symbol
m and a hopping variable a  in the transmiter’s 
hopping sequence. Note that the operation  in this
paper is the modulo-M addition. We assume that
transmitters have independent hopping sequences, and
each hopping sequence is modeled by a sequence of
independent random variables that are uniformly
distributed over {0, 1, 2,…, M－1}. Transmission
occurs over a channel that includes multiple access
interference, Rayleigh fading, and thermal noise with
power spectral density N0 /2. We assume that both
signals in different chip intervals and signals from
different transmitters are subjected to independent
Rayleigh fading. Moreover, we assume that fading is
slow enough (relative to the hopping rate) so that it
remains constant over a chip interval.
The fast FH/SSMA systems are synchronous; in
other words, the chip intervals of different transmitters
are time-aligned at all receivers. The received signal is
demodulated by a non-coherent M-FSK demodulator,
which consists of a bank of M energy detectors
matched to the M tones in M-FSK. Let iR be the
detector output for the i th tone and R = (R0, R1,…,
RM-1) be the received vector of a chip. The received
vector is then despread to form the vector 'R = (R’0,
R’1 ,…, R’M -1) with
amm RR ' (2)

We observe that the dominating terms in the
upper bounds on and SICCP in (14) and
(18) decrease as freed and freef increase and increase
as 0D and 0F increase, respectively. Since freed
and freef are free distances of the same code
measured in bit and symbol, respectively,
freefree fd  (19)
On the other hand, it can be easily proved that
2/000 MFDF  (20)
Fig. 1 plots the values of 0D and its upper bound
2/0MF for parameters 00 N (no thermal noise),
L = 4, and M = 64 and 256. We observe that the value
of 0D is close to the value of 2/0MF and thus is
much larger than the value of 0F .Combining this
observation with (19), we conclude that the bit error
rate of the CC-SI scheme is less than that of the
CC-BI scheme except for very small bit error rates.
This conclusion is in agreement with both the
theoretical upper bounds and the simulation results
plotted in Fig. 2.
We now investigate the insight behind the
phenomenon. Bit-interleaving induces two
counter-acting forces on decoding performance. On
the one hand, bit-interleaving disperses consecutive
error bits caused by a noisy M-ary signal and makes
the errors more correctable. On the other hand, the
same measure loses bit dependency information in the
process of computing a posteriori probability of each
coded bit and therefore compromises decoder
performance. The following example with parameters
00 N and M = 64 is used to illustrate how receiver
loses bit dependency information. The intended
transmitter transmits the 64-ary coded symbol
corresponding to 6543210 bbbbbbb = 000000. At the
receiver, only two rows in the output matrix S
corresponding to 6543210 bbbbbbb = 000000 and
6543210 bbbbbbb = 011011 are all one’s. In other words, 
symbol ambiguity arises with both 000000 and
011011 being possible transmitted symbols. Thus, the
entropy of 6543210 bbbbbbb in the output matrix is 1
bit. The process of computing a posteriori probability
for each coded bit causes the entropy of these bits to
increase to 4 bits, since the a posteriori probabilities
indicate that 2b , 3b , 5b , and 6b can be 0 or 1 with
equal probability. Thus, when symbol ambiguities
arise, the receiver loses bit dependency information in
the process of computing a posteriori probability of
each coded bit. Observe that a large population of
transmitters results in frequent occurrence of symbol
ambiguities and the loss of a large amount of bit
dependency information by employing bit-interleaving.
Hence, we conclude that when there are a large
number of transmitters, the benefit of error dispersion
in bit-interleaving is outweighted by the performance
degradation caused by loss of bit dependency
information.
Iterative decoding (ID) technique has been shown
BICC P
6bit-interleaving on the performance of fast FH/SSMA
systems with M-FSK modulation. We found that
bit-interleaving process increases the free distance of
convolutional codes, but loses bit-dependency
soft-decision information. Moreover, the performance
improvement gained by the increment of free distance
is outweighted by the performance degradation due to
information loss, except for very small bit error rates.
The simulation results further show that the
soft-decision decoding schemes without
bit-interleaving achieve considerably better
performance than RS codes with errors-and-erasures
decoding. For comparison, we also derived theoretical
upped bounds on bit error rates for errors-and-erasures
channel and found that the same observation does not
apply in this case, since for erasure channel, no
information is lost in bit-interleaving process.
