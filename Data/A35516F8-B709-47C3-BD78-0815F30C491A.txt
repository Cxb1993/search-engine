Abstract
Stripping crystallization (SC), also called distillative freezing (DF), is introduced to separate the
catechol/4-methoxyphenol mixture. In principle, SC is operated at a triple-point condition, in which
the liquid mixture is simultaneously vaporized and crystallized due to the three-phase equilibrium.
Thus, SC combines distillation and crystallization to produce pure crystals. Due to the high
crystallization temperatures of catechol and 4-methoxyphenol, a SC apparatus equipped with the
heating system is designed to separate the catechol/4-methoxyphenol mixture. The experiments
show that SC can purify catechol in the catechol-rich mixture. On the other hand, it is difficult to
purify 4-methoxyphenol in the 4-methoxyphenol-rich mixture.
Keywords: crystallization, distillation, distillative freezing, catechol, 4-methoxyphenol
Introduction
Separation and purification plays an
important role in a chemical manufacturing
process. In general, separation and purification
processes account for 40-70% of both capital
and operating costs in chemical industry, and
their proper application can significantly reduce
costs and increase profits.1-2 Among various
separation techniques, crystallization is
extensively used in different industrial
applications and exceeded in scope only by
distillation processes.3-4 Crystallization has
received renewed interest with the rising
demand for pure intermediates/products in the
pharmaceutical and chemical industries.5-6
Hybrid distillation/melt crystallization
processes are also widely used for the
separation of isomer mixtures.7-8
Stripping crystallization (SC), also called
distillative freezing (DF), has been developed
recently in our laboratory to separate the
mixtures with close boiling temperatures,
including the mixed xylenes,9-11 the
diethylbenzene isomers,12 and the
benzene/cyclohexane mixture.13 In principle,
SC is operated at a triple-point condition, in
which the liquid mixture is simultaneously
vaporized and crystallized due to the
three-phase equilibrium. Thus, SC combines
distillation and crystallization to produce pure
crystals. By lowering temperature and reducing
pressure during the operation, SC results in the
formation of pure crystals, and liquid phase and
vapor phase of mixtures. In essence, SC is
continued until the liquid phase is completely
eliminated and only pure crystals remain in the
feed. Thus, compared to the conventional
crystallization, filtration or centrifugation is not
needed to separate the solid crystals from the
mother liquor since no mother liquor is present
with the pure crystals. In addition, crystal
washing is not required since no impurities are
adhered on the crystal surfaces at the end of the
operation.9
In the previous SC applications, the
crystallization temperatures of the produced
crystals at the three-point condition are all
below room temperature. For example, in the
separation of cyclohexan from the

SC simulation process
The SC process is simulated in a series of
N equilibrium stage operation shown in Figure
2. Each stage is operated at a three-phase
equilibrium. The temperature of each stage is
chosen to meet TTT nn 1 for
Nn ,...,2,1 . The vapor formed in each stage is
condensed to the liquid and removed while the
solid and the liquid formed in each stage enter
the next stage. The whole process starts from
the liquid feed and continues until the liquid
phase is completely eliminated.

the cooling water is used to condense the vapor.
During the experiments, the reactor pressure is
controlled by adjusting the valve connected to
the vacuum pump and the temperature is
controlled by adjusting the constant temperature
bath.
The feed is prepared by mixing catechol
(Sigma-Aldrich, > 99% purity) and
4-methoxyphenol (Sigma-Aldrich, > 99%
purity) in different ratios. Then, the sample
temperature is lowered gradually with the
increasing time. The cooling rate generally
starts at sec/033.0 C and then decreases
gradually to sec/0083.0 C at the end.
Typically, one experiment is finished within
3000-6000 sec. In the experiment, a
temperature probe (type K, thermocouple,
accuracy: 8.0 ℃) is positioned in the center of
the liquid feed and a pressure gauge (Micro-ion
plus, Granville-Phillips, accuracy: %50 ) is
connected to the glass reactor.
As the sample temperature in the chamber
is lowered, the pressure is reduced by
controlling the vacuum pump. A series of the
three-phase equilibrium conditions are achieved
by controlling the temperature and pressure
based on the simulation results. Thus, the liquid
mixture is simultaneously vaporized and
solidified due to the three-phase equilibrium.
The actual SC experiment here is stopped at the
lowest pressure attainable in the apparatus
depending on the corresponding temperature. In
the end, the sample remained in the vessel is
weighed and its composition is analyzed by
HPLC. It is checked that the material balance is
satisfied for each experimental run, i.e., the
total mass of the product crystals and the
condensed vapor equals that of the feed.

Results and discussion
In the first part, SC is applied to produce
catechol (A) crystals from the catechol-rich
mixture in the range 71.00  BX (i.e.,
129.0  AX ). The SC simulation equations
are solved for three feeds: feed 1 (0.02 Kg with
80.0, AWX ), feed 2 (0.02 Kg with
85.0, AWX ) and feed 3 (0.02 Kg with
90.0, AWX ). Figure 4 displays the calculated
curve, )(TP , to simulate the SC operating
conditions in the production of catechol crystals.
Thus, as temperature decreases during the SC
experiments, the corresponding pressure for the
three-phase equilibrium is depicted by )(TP .
In Figure 4, the calculated final purity of
the product versus the final operating
temperature, )(, TX AW , is plotted as three
curves, one for each feed. The staring point of
each curve represents the feed purity and the
initial SC operating temperature. Ten
experimental runs are performed in comparison
with the simulated results. Each data point
represents the experimental final purity of the
product versus the final operating temperature
at the end of SC for an experimental run. The
number in the parenthesis next to each data
point represents the recovery rate.
The simulation predicts that feed 1 can be
purified from 80.0, AWX to 825.0, AWX
with %76SR as SC is operated from C95
to C59 . Two experimental runs are
performed for feed 1 based on the simulated
temperature and pressure. The experimental
results show that feed 1 is purified from
80.0, AWX to 905~90.0, AWX with
%63~%61ER .

results for separation of 4-methoxyphenol from the

initial purity for feed 4, represents simulated final
purity for feed 4, represents experimental final purity
for feed 4; represents initial purity for feed 5,
represents simulated final purity for feed 5,
represents experimental final purity for feed 5).
As predicted by the SC simulations, the
experimental results indicated that it is difficult
to further purify 4-methoxyphenol from the
4-methoxyphenol-rich mixture since the
operable temperature by SC is only in the range
56℃~36℃. On the other hand, it is easier to
further purify catechol from the catechol-rich
mixture since the operable temperature by SC is
in the range 104.6℃~36℃. In general, the
experimental recovery rate is lower than the
simulated recovery rate in the purification of
either catechol or 4-methoxyphenol by SC.
The discrepancy between the simulated
and experimental results can be attributed to the
following reasons: (a) The simulation results
are obtained based on the assumption that each
stage is operated at the three-phase equilibrium.
However, the three-phase equilibrium might not
always be attained during the experiments. (b)
It is difficult to perform the experiments at each
stage under the absolutely adiabatic condition.
(c) The physical properties and the Wilson
parameters in the simulations are taken from the
literature for a normal pressure and a certain
temperature range. However, the SC
experiments are operated at low pressure and
sometimes beyond the applicable temperature
range. (d) Liquid inclusion might occur in
crystal growth during the SC operation. (e)
Some liquid among crystals might not be
completely removed at the end of experiments.
If the actual data of the physical properties
and the Wilson parameters in the studied
temperature and pressure range are available,
the true three-phase equilibrium conditions can
be determined by the proposed model. Then,
the temperature and pressure of the SC
experiments can be carefully controlled to
insure that the three-phase equilibrium is
always attained during the experiments. As the
proposed model provides the true three-phase
equilibrium conditions, the experimental results
should be more consistent with the calculated
results predicted by the model.
Conclusions
A SC apparatus equipped with the heating
system is designed to separate the
catechol/4-methoxyphenol mixture. To account
for the nonideality of the
catechol/4-methoxyphenol liquid mixture, a
model is developed to simulate the three-phase
equilibrium during the SC operation. Although
the simulations deviate significantly from the
experimental results due to the five reasons
described previously, the model still provides a
useful scheme in the SC operation. It is found
that SC can be efficiently employed to further
purify catechol from the catechol-rich mixture.
On the other hand, it is quite difficult to further
purify 4-methoxyphenol from the
4-methoxyphenol-rich mixture. The unique
feature of SC is that, as the impurity is
vaporized and pure crystal is produced during
the operation, filtration and crystal washing is
not required at the end.
