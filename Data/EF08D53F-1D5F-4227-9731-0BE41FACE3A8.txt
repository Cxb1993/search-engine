Abstract 
 
This proposal presents the flight control 
design for a two degree of freedom 
helicopter. The strategy of explicit 
model-following design methodology is 
applied to control the input voltage of two 
DC motors such that the experimental 
helicopter behaves like of nominal model. 
The technique of command generator tracker 
is applied to convert the model-matching 
problem into a regulator problem. Both 
computer simulation and experiment results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel 
flight control technology. 
 
Keywords: Two Degree of Freedom 
Helicopter, Model Matching, Explicit 
Model-Following Control. 
 
二、研究目的與文獻探討 
 
The helicopter has already been used 
popularly in civil aviation or military. It 
takes-off vertically and landing without 
airstrip. In the daily life, helicopter is a very 
important vehicle. As a result of the body of 
a helicopter is not huge, it is used extensively 
to rescue disasters and be transportation. The 
flight attitude of a helicopter will depend on 
the front and back propellers. The control 
system of a helicopter is generally a 
nonlinear system. In the research [1], the 
authors presented a nonlinear dynamic model 
for a coaxial helicopter in hover condition. It 
is not easy to execute the task that the 
helicopter flies steady and command it to 
achieve a position desired exactly. Therefore, 
it is important to study the attitude control of 
a helicopter. 
Recently, there have been a lot of 
researches in the flight control of a helicopter. 
In the papers [2] and [3], the LQR 
optimization theory is applied to design the 
flight controller of a helicopter. However, the 
weighting matrices of the LQR controller are 
usually determined by a trial- and-error 
method based on the designer’s experience. 
There have not been yet systematic and 
express methods in selecting of the 
state-variable weighting Q and the 
control-energy weight R [4]. 
In this proposal, the design of control 
system of helicopter is treated as the 
model-following tracker problem. The 
command generator tracker is applied to the 
design of explicit model-following control 
such that the perfect tracking is guaranteed 
[5]. The advantages of this design are the 
optimal gains have gain margins from 0.5 to 
infinity and phase margins of 60 deg or more 
[6]. Therefore, the technology is applied to 
the flight control of a two-degree-of-freedom 
helicopter. After the system is augmented, 
the LQ regulator optimization is performed. 
Another benefit is that this controller

where 
QhhQ T=  
The weighting matrix Q and R are chosen 
such that the performance index is minimized. 
The closed-loop system 
)( KBAA ggc −=  
Therefore, the performance index may be 
expressed in terms of K as 
dtRKKQJ TT∫∞ += 0 )(21 ζζ  
Let 
ζζζζ )()( RKKQP
dt
d TTT +−=  
where P is a constant, symmetric, positive 
semi-definite matrix. Differentiating Eq. (24) 
results in 
ζζζζζζ )( cTcTTT PAPAPP +=+ &&  
ζζ )( RKKQ TT +−=  
Thus, a constraint equation is obtained to 
satisfy 
0=+++= QRKKPAPAg TcTc  
This is an algebraic Riccati equation (A.R.E). 
The performance index may be written as 
)()(lim

T ζζζζ ∞→−=  
The closed-loop system is stable so that 
ζ(t) vanishes with time and the performance 
index becomes 
)0()0(

For an appropriately dimensioned matrices 
Ag and Bg, Eq. (29) may be formed as

where 
)0()0( TX ζζ=  
To solve P and K, the Lagrange multiplier 
approach is introduced. Define the 
Hamiltonian 
H )()( gStrPXtr +=  
where S is the Lagrange multiplier. By partial 
differential with S, P and K, three equations 
are derived

After solving the three-coupled equations, 
the optimal control gain K is obtained

Once the control gain K has been found, it 
can be partitioned into three parts as

The longitudinal performance of 
nominal model is given as follows, rise time 
is specified as 2.2 seconds, settling time is 3 
seconds and damping ratio is 0.9. The lateral 
performance of nominal model is the same as 
the longitude. Therefore, the state space of 
nominal model is represented as
