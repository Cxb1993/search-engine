can be applied in any kind of wireless access networks as long as AMC is supported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
only work which solves this problem and provides all the above advantages. 
The remainder of the report is organized as follows. In Section II, we model the system and describe the proposed scheme. In 
Section III, we discuss the difficulty of the problem and its computational complexity. Section IV contains an analysis of the 
simulation results, and Section V concludes the report. 
II. ECONOMIC BASED DISTRIBUTED ALLOCATION 
A. System Model and Problem Specification 
Let the number of RSs and SSs be M and N respectively; and to identify nodes, each one is labeled with a unique integer. Let 
node 0 be the BS, nodes 1 to M be RSs, and nodes M+1 to M+N be SSs. Let jir ,  denote the resource required to transmit the 
stream from node i to j; while ],...,[ 10 Mrrr  represents the allocation, in which mr  is the resource allocated to sender  m, 
where Mm 0 . To describe the connectivity of senders, we use the binary functions )(mD , Mm 0 , to indicate if a 
sender m can receive the stream from the BS when allocation   is given. 1)( mD  
means that there exists a route 
]0[ m  that satisfies the two conditions: (i) 1)( mD  (node m  can receive the stream from the BS); and (ii) 
mmm rr  ,  (m can receive from m ), where Mm 0  is the preceding node on route ]0[ m .  
Given allocation 
 
and the channel conditions of the network (i.e., jir ,  for all i and j,), )(mD  of all senders (i.e., all 
Mm  ) can be derived as follows. Initially, )(mD  is set to 0 for all 0m , while 1)(0 D  because the BS can receive 
the stream initially. Then, )(mD  of all unserved RSs (i.e., 0)( mD ) that can receive the stream from the BS (i.e., all m 
with 0,0 rr m  ) is set to 1. Next, all unserved RSs that can receive from served senders (all m that can find a Mm 0 that 
satisfies mmm rr  ,  and 1)( mD ) are included. This is repeated until no more RSs can be included. Given an allocation 
 , it takes )( 2MO  steps to compute )(mD  for all m.  
Based on the above notations, we can formally define our problem Multi-Hop Multicast Maximization as follows:

B. Proposed Architecture 
We propose a distributed mechanism called Priced-Based Distributed Allocation (PBDA) to solve MHMM. To distribute the 
wireless resource efficiently, we introduce a new role called Bandwidth Broker (BB), which may belong to the network carrier 
that owns the radio bandwidth. Since the received content is identical regardless of the source, we let all SSs pay a fixed price 
(i.e., streamp ) to its sender when receiving the stream, while an RS can receive the stream from other senders free of charge 
when the channel quality allows because the stream has no utility to the RS itself. To transmit the stream and earn revenue, RSs 
must buy a certain amount of bandwidth from BB based on the unit price of the resource. The value of the unit price is 
determined by BB dynamically from a predetermined matrix ],...,[
max21 I
pppP  , where maxI  is the number of price options. 
The BB decides the unit price, and each sender requests the amount of bandwidth that will maximize its revenue. With the 
requested resource of each sender, the multicast routes of the stream can be constructed. Fig. 2 shows each node’s operation in 
PBDA.

Based on the value of streamp  and served , sender m declares its preferred resource 
i

newserved _  and newD , which record the new served  and D respectively if it is allocated

overwrites served  and D with newserved _  and newD  respectively. The new served  and D are given to the queried sender 
in the next loop. This procedure repeats until 1) all senders are queried; 2) all SSs have been served; or 3) the wireless resource is 
exhausted. After forming allocations under all prices (i.e., ],...,,[ 10

III. ANALYSIS 
In Theorem 1, we prove that MHMM is NP-complete. Theorem 2 shows that PBDA has polynomial complexity. 
Theorem 1: MHMM is NP-hard. 
Proof:  
To prove that MHMM NP-complete, we consider another problem called Single-Hop Multicast Maximization (SHMM). 
Similar to MHMM, SHMM involves maximizing the number of recipients with the given resource budget. However, in SHMM , 
RSs can only relay data between the BS and SSs; they cannot relay data for other RSs.  
SHMM can be reduced to a well-known NP-complete problem called Integral Knapsack [11]. Let iv  and iw  be the value 
and weight of a box i respectively. Integral Knapsack maximizes the total values of boxes put into a bag, (i.e., 
i
iv ,) subject to 
the total weight of the boxes not exceeding the limitation W (i.e., Ww
i
i  ), where Zwvi ii  ,, . SHMM can be reduced to 
Integral Knapsack because a box (say, ],[ ii WV ) can be transformed into an RS i and a corresponding group containing iV  SSs. 
In such a group, all SSs n have the same resource requirement ini Wr , , while the RS’s resource requirement 0,0 ir . So any 
instance (i.e., set of boxes and the weight limitation) of the Integral Knapsack can be mapped to an instance of SHMM (i.e., set of 
groups and the resource budget). The problem of maximizing the value of the boxes given a weight limit can be transformed into 
maximizing the number of recipients subject to resource budget. Since SHMM is more general then Integral Knapsack, which is 
known to be NP-hard, we know that SHMM is also NP-hard.  
Next, we verify that SHMM is a special case of MHMM. Any instance of SHMM is an instance of MHMM in which the 
required resource between RSs is larger than the budget, i.e., budgetmm rr 21 ,  for all Mmm  21,0 . Since MHMM is more 
general than SHMM, the latter is also NP-hard.▋ 
Theorem 2: The complexity of PBDA is )( 2NMO . 
Proof: 
As shown in Fig. 3, there are two for loops and one do loop in the main function of PBDA. The complexity of the first for 
loop is O(1) because maxI  is a constant. On the other hand, the complexity of the do loop is O(M) because it queries at least one

C. Simulation II 
To observe the stability of the allocation, we define “sacrificed SSs” as the SSs that are served before a new SS joins and 
requests the stream, but are not served afterwards. This can happen because a new SS may cause senders to make different 
decisions and thus change the network topology. The number of sacrificed SSs should be kept as low as possible to ensure the 
service of receiving users not interrupted. Similar to Simulation I, we set a=3, N=100, and tune budgetr  in the range 0 to 
3100 . 
After the allocation has been computed, a new SS is placed randomly in the circular area. After the new allocation is generated, 
we compare it with the previous one and calculate sacrificed SSs. Again, the results of each setting are averaged over 100 
random runs. 
The results in Fig. 6 show the trend of the sacrificed SSs. When the value of budgetr  is moderate (between 600,000 and 
800,000), the number of sacrificed SSs tends to be larger, and there are more sacrificed SSs when M is large. This is because, 
when there are more RSs and the budget allows more RSs to be active, SSs have more diverse senders; hence, it is more possible 
that SSs will be affected as the topology changes. However, given different budgets and numbers of RSs, the maximal number of 
sacrificed SSs is less than 0.35, which is a very small portion. Under different conditions, PBDA interrupts very few served SSs 
and provides stable services when a new subscriber joins. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this project, we study the multicast resource allocation problem in wireless relay networks. We formulate the problem as 
Multi-Hop Multicast Maximization (MHMM), and propose an economics-based algorithm called Price-Based Distributed 
Allocation (PBDA). The proposed scheme allows each component, including the Base-Station, Relay-Station and the 
Bandwidth-Broker to operate separately. Through analysis, we show that MHMM is NP-complete and that PBDA has 
polynomial-time complexity.  
The performance of PBDA is validated through simulations. The results show that the more RSs there are, the better the 
performance is, which means PBDA can indeed utilize RSs. In addition, under different conditions, users are always rarely 
affected by newly arrived recipients. The simulation results show that PBDA is an efficient, high-performance, and realistic 
scheme with a low signaling overhead; thus, it can be adapted to different kinds of wireless relay networks in the real world.
