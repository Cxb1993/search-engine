Abstract—A new balanced amplifier (BA) using metamaterial- 
based quadrature power splitters (QPSs) is presented in this letter. 
Instead of using conventional 90° couplers, the developed BA is 
implemented by two parallel amplifiers with broadband 
metamaterial-based QPSs at input and output ends. Since the 
QPSs can provide a broadband quadrature phase difference 
between two outputs, the input/output reflections from two 
amplifiers can be effectively cancelled over a wide bandwidth. 
The developed BA demonstrates the input/output return loss of 
better than 10 dB from 1.2 GHz to 3.5 GHz with 97.9% relative 
bandwidth.

I. INTRODUCTION 
ONVENTIONALLY, a balanced amplifier (BA) is realized by 
integrating two identical amplifiers with input and output 
90° hybrid couplers as shown in Fig. 1 (a). It has advantages of 
improving the input/output matching, optimizing the single 
amplifier performance regardless of input/output matching, and 
easily detecting circuit failure [1]. Since two 90° hybrid 
couplers are employed to cancel the input/output reflection 
from two amplifiers, the input/output matching performance of 
the BA is dependent on the characteristics of the 90° coupler. 
    Based on the circuit configuration shown in Fig. 1 (a), 
microwave BAs have been implemented with different types of 
couplers, such as branch-line couplers (BLCs) [2]-[4], Lange 
couplers [5]-[7], and broadside couplers [8], [9]. In 
consequence, the increment of the quadrature phase bandwidth 
between two output ports of the coupler leads to significantly 
enhance the input/output return loss bandwidth of the BA.  
A new broadband quadrature power splitter (QPS) [10] has 
been developed to achieve a broadband quadrature phase 
difference using the metamaterial (MM) transmission line (TL) 
[11]. It is realized by a Wilkinson power divider with a +45° 
well-synthesized MM TL and a −45° conventional microstrip 
(MS) line. An amplitude imbalance of less than 0.9 dB and a 
phase error of less than ±5° have been experimentally

demonstrated over frequency range from 1.1 GHz to 3.5 GHz 
with 104% relative bandwidth.  
In order to improve the return loss bandwidth, in this letter, 
metamaterial-based QPSs are exploited to realize the BA as 
shown in Fig. 1 (b). Two broadband QPSs replace conventional 
90° couplers to implement the BA together with two identical 
amplifiers. For comparison, a single amplifier and a 
conventional BA using BLCs are also fabricated and measured 
to clearly manifest the performance improvement of the BA 
using metamaterial-based QPSs. 
II. BROADBAND QUADRATURE POWER SPLITTER 
Based on the design procedures in [10], the broadband QPS 
is implemented using the circuit configuration shown in Fig. 2 
(a). It is composed of a Wilkinson power divider, a 
conventional microstrip, and a MM TL. The conventional 
microstrip and MM TL are connected to two output ports of the 
divider as a phase adjusting circuit to achieve broadband 
quadrature phase difference. In this letter, the 
metamaterial-based QPS shown in Fig. 2 (a) is designed at the 
center frequency of 2 GHz and fabricated on the FR4 substrate 
with 1.5-mm thickness and the dielectric constant of 4.3. In 
addition, the left-handed (LH) section in the MM TL is realized

gain reduction of less than 3 dB over frequency range of 0.8-3.7 
GHz. It is because the transmission loss and amplitude 
imbalance of two QPSs degrade the amplifier gain. The BA 
using BLCs obtains reasonable gain performance only around 
the design frequency of 2 GHz. Its gain characteristics are 
mainly limited by the amplitude imbalance and quadrature 
phase bandwidth of the BLC shown in Fig. 2 (b). The noise 
figures of the BAs are measured by Agilent E4445A spectrum 
analyzer with the noise figure measurement option 219. The 
noise figure of the BA using QPSs is less than 3 dB from 0.7 
GHz to 3GHz, whereas the BA using BLCs gives the noise 
figure of larger than 2.8 dB over the measured frequency band. 
The results shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 demonstrate that 
the developed BA using QPSs not only improve the return loss 
and noise figure bandwidths, but also achieve a flatter gain 
response.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this letter, a broadband BA has been implemented and 
experimentally verified. Compared with the conventional 
circuit configuration using BLCs, it is demonstrated that the 
BA using QPSs can effectively improve the input/output return 
loss bandwidth, the flatness of gain response, and the noise 
figure characteristics. In addition, compared with other types of 
couplers, the performance comparison shown in Table I 
demonstrates that using metamaterial-based QPSs is an 
effective approach to realize a BA with a broadband return loss 
bandwidth.

Conclusion: A wide-band balun using the CRLH TL has been
designed, implemented, and experimentally validated in this Letter.
It utilises the phase synthesis property of the CRLH TL to achieve the
phase-adjusting TL with a broadband 180 phase-advanced angle
compared with the conventional TL. The measured results demon-
strate that using the CRLH TL is an effective approach to design a
wide-band balun. In addition, the multilayered low temperature co-
fired ceramic (ML LTCC) or monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC)
fabrication processes can be applied to implement the wide-band
balun proposed in this Letter with further circuit size reduction.

Wilkinson power divider, a conventional microstrip, and a 
MM TL. The Wilkinson power divider equally separates the 
input power into two output ports, and also provides good 
isolation between them. The conventional microstrip and MM 
TL are connected to two output ports of the divider as phase 
adjusting TLs to achieve broadband 90° or 180° phase 
difference.  
Figure 1 (b) shows the phase responses of the MM TL and 
microstrip. Referring to the microstrip, the phase response of 
the MM TL is synthesized to have the 90° or 180° phase 
increment at 1f and 2f , and achieve the same slope of the 
phase-response curve as that of the MS [8]. Therefore, as two 
phase-adjusting TLs are connected with two output ports of the 
power divider, a QPS or balun can be implemented with a 
broadband phase difference and a good isolation between two 
output ports.  
III. BANDWIDTH-ENHANCED QPS AND BALUN 
The bandwidth-enhanced QPS and balun are realized using 
the circuit configuration shown in Fig. 1 (a). The FR4 
substrate with 1.5-mm thickness, dielectric constant of 4.3, 
and loss tangent of 0.02 is employed to fabricate the 
developed QPS and balun. In addition, the LH section in the 
MM TL is realized by Murata 0603 (1.6 mm×0.8 mm) chip 
inductors and capacitors. The measured results in this paper 
are carried out by the Anritsu 37300C vector network analyzer. 
For QPS development, the frequencies 0f , 1f , and 2f  are 
respectively chosen as 1 GHz, 1.2 GHz, and 2.8 GHz to 
achieve a 80% design bandwidth. The circuit is implemented 
as shown in Fig. 2 (a), and its dimension parameters are 
indicated as well. As depicted in the inset of Fig. 2 (a), the LH 
section is cascaded by two T-networks with L=12.1 nH 
(realized by 3.9 nH and 8.2 nH inductors) and C=5 pF. Two 
50°-bends are connected with two outputs of the QPS for the 
convenience to measure the isolation performance.  
For balun development, the frequencies 0f , 1f , and 2f  are 
respectively chosen as 2 GHz, 1.4 GHz, and 2.6 GHz to give a 
60% design bandwidth. As depicted in the inset of Fig.2 (b), 
two T-networks with L=5.7 nH (realized by 1.8 nH and 3.9 nH) 
and C=2.2 pF  are cascaded to form the LH section. The 
circuit dimension parameters are also indicated in Fig. 2 (b). 
For measurement consideration, two 50° bends are linked to 
two output ports of the balun with the convenience to measure 
the isolation performance.  
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. Measured Results of the Developed QPS 
The measured reflection coefficients at the input port and 
isolation performance between two output ports of the 
developed QPS are shown in Fig. 3 (a). The 11| |S  is better 
than -10 dB from 0.85 GHz to 3.46 GHz, while the isolation 
32| |S  is larger than 10 dB from 0.9 GHz to 3.3 GHz. The 
measured transmission coefficients and amplitude imbalance 
between two output ports are also illustrated in Fig. 3 (a). The 
maximum output imbalance, namely 31 21| | | |S S− , is about 0.9 
dB from 0.5 GHz to 3.5 GHz.  
The measured phase difference between two output ports of 
the QPS is shown in Fig. 3 (b). The phase difference at 1f  and 
2f  are close to the design specifications, while considering 
90 5° ± ° phase difference, the frequency range is from 1.1 GHz 
to 3.5 GHz with a 104% relative bandwidth. As the bandwidth 
is calculated by taking the ratio of the frequency range within 
5± °  phase error to the center frequency 0f  [6], a 120% relative 
bandwidth is achieved. For comparison, the 90° hybrid coupler 
and the QPS composed of two different-length conventional 
microstrips are fabricated at 2 GHz. The measured phase 
differences of two compared circuits also shown in Fig. 3 (b). 
B. Measured Results of the Developed Balun 
The measured reflection and transmission coefficients of 
the developed balun are shown in Fig. 4 (a). The input 
reflection coefficient 11| |S  is better than -10 dB from 1 GHz to 
4 GHz, while the amplitude imbalance between two output 
ports, namely 31 21| | | |S S− , is about 0.7 dB from 1.24 GHz to

結果係使用 Anritsu 3700C的網路分析儀進行量測。
為了實現具有 80%設計頻寬之 90相位差功率分配

nH和 8.2 nH串聯獲得)、電容值為 5 pF。爲了方便量測
隔離度的性能，故將兩個輸出埠分別連接至具有 50轉
角的微帶線。
此外，為了實現具有 60%設計頻寬之 180相位差之
功率分配器，頻率 f0、f1和 f2分別選擇為 2GHz，1.4GHz
和 2.6GHz。如圖 2(b)所描述，左手傳輸線亦使用兩級 T

了與其他具有相同特性之微波元件比較，中心頻率設計
於 2GHz時之枝幹耦合器(branch-line coupler)及由兩個不
同長度之傳統微帶線所構成的 90相位差之功率分配器
亦一併製作，其測量結果如圖 3(b)所示。
B、180相位差之功率分配器的測量結果
圖 4(a)為 180相位差之功率分配器的反射及穿透係
數，輸入端的反射係數 |S11| 從 1 GHz到 4 GHz皆低於-
10 dB，兩輸出埠間之最大振幅不平衡 (即 |S31|-|S21|)頻率
從 1.24 GHz 到 3.85 GHz 大約為 0.7 dB。如圖 4(b)所
示，180相位差之功率分配器的兩個輸出埠間相位差，
在設計頻率 f1和 f2 (即 1.4 GHz和 2.6 GHz)，其相位差分
別是 180.2和 177.7。此外，當考慮到 180±10的相位
圖 2 (a)及(b)分別為 90及 180相位差之寬頻功率分配器。
差時，可達 97%的相對頻寬，其頻率範圍為 1.24 GHz到
3.58 GHz。若使用設計中心頻率 f0來計算±10誤差之相
對頻寬時，則可獲得 117%的相對頻寬。為了與其他具
有相同特性之微波元件比較，環形耦合器及由兩個不同
長度之傳統微帶線所組成的 180相位差之功率分配器，
亦設計及製作於 2GHz 之中心頻率，其量測結果一併顯
示於圖 4(b)。若考慮相位頻寬特性之良窳，本文所提出
之電路架構，明顯優於傳統具 180相位差輸出的微波元
件。
五、 特性討論
為比較其他研究團隊所提出的 90相位差功率分配
器與本文所研製的新型功率分配器，其元件性能整理於
表 I 中。相較於參考文獻中使用前瞻積體電路製程，本
研究雖然使用印刷電路板製作，但還是可獲得具有競爭
力的電路效能。另一方面，使用左手傳輸線實現 180相
位差功率分配器之電路特性比較，如表 II 所示。本文所
研製的 180相位差功率分配器，其相位頻寬顯著地提
高，主要係因使用左手傳輸線之相位響應可任意地合成
的概念，並使用兩個合成頻率點有效地控制左手傳輸線
的相位響應曲線。
