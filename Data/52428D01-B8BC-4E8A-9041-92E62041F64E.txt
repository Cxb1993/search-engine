摘要
本研究提出以類切換式電容電路(QSC)為基礎之
多輸出選擇(multiple output choice)的直流對直流轉換
器(9.0/5.0V, 9/3.3V, 9.0/2.0V)，其以 CPLD 為數位控
制器的主體，進行一低功率轉換電路的實現(輸入電
壓:7~9V,負載 50~400 甌姆)。其中數位控制部份:以
Verilog CPLD、ADC/DAC 及 OP amp.來達成閉路控
制，如此硬體語言 Verilog 的做法，可使得控制器的
設計變得更有彈性、簡單且可靠。事實上，切換式電
容(SC)電路勿需磁性元件，故未來電路積體化的工作
將更為有希望，因而相當適合於低功率 VLSI 的應
用。在此電路中還使用了交錯式的壓控電流源，來進
行不同 cell 中電容的充電工作，如此可防止電源端電
流不連續現象的產生，因而具有較低的電磁干擾
(EMI)現象。如此的電流模式控制不僅可增強輸出對
電源雜訊干擾的強健能力，還可強化輸出對負載瞬變
時的調整能力。最後，以硬體的實現實際驗證所設計

1. 動機背景
In recent years, due to the popularity of potable electronic
equipments, for example, PDA, notebook, cellular phone,
digital camera, pager, and e-book …etc., their DC-DC power
module always asks for some good features of small volume,
light weight, high power density and efficiency, and good
regulation capability. Besides, to fit in with requirements of
various functions all in one, both multiple output choice and
flexible controller design become essential to power module
design gradually. Therefore, more manufactures and
researchers pay much attention to this topic on development of
a more flexible power converter for low-power applications,
ultimately requiring DC-DC converters realized on a chip by
mixed analog VLSI technology.
In 1996, Chung and Ioinovici suggested a completely
new converter scheme, called quasi-switched-capacitor (QSC)
step-down converter, employed by current-mode control idea
[1]. Basically, this converter configuration is composed of two
SC cells working in anti-phase periods. In fact, this
configuration is almost similar to that of Cheong’s [2], but the 
most different point between them is to use a constant current
source for charging capacitors (current-mode), not to use a
constant voltage source (voltage-mode). Here, some
MOSFETS are operated in pinch-off region as a
voltage-controlled current source, so the capacitor voltage is
linearly changed with time, not exponentially charged as [2].
Thus, the input current is continuous and constant, but not
discontinuous and variant as [2], so EMI problem can be
improved. From 1999, researchers are concentrated mainly in
regulation improvement and capability enhancement of the
QSC converter [3]-[8]. Henry suggested a multi-stage design
of QSC DC-DC converter for improving voltage regulation
and current drive capability [3]. For step-down design, n
capacitors are discharged in parallel, and then the larger output
current can be generated for the heavier load drive [4]. For
step-up design, n capacitors are discharged in series for
supplying the higher voltage load [5]. However, some
improvement spaces still exist, for example, multiple output
choice, controller reliability, and controller design flexibility.
In this paper, based on the CPLD-based digital controller, a
simple QSC step-down DC-DC converter with multiple output
choice is implemented for a variety of low-power output. Such
a Verilog-code-based CPLD chip can make controller design
more flexible, simple, and reliable.
2. 系統架構分析
2.1 CPLD-Based QSC Converter Scheme:
Fig.1 shows the overall circuit configuration of
CPLD-based QSC step-down DC-DC converter, and it
contains two parts: “power part” and “control part” for 
achieving the closed-loop control of QSC converter with
multiple output choice. First, the above half of Fig.1 deals with
the power part: QSC step-down DC-DC converter, which is
composed of capacitors and MOSFETS as shown in Fig.2 [1].
The basic control operation is described as follows. In the first
half-cycle, let QSA operate in pinch-off region as a constant
controlled current source, turn off SA and QSB, and turn on
SB in triode region as a small resistor. Thus, all capacitors of
cell A are linearly charged by the constant current source. At
the same time, all capacitors of cell B are discharged to supply
the load LR . Based on the same idea, in the second half-cycle,
exchange the works of two cells, and then run the operation
cyclically. Thus, it is obvious that the output ov can be
regulated relative to how much the capacitors are charged by
controlled current source. Fig.3 shows the theoretical current
waveforms of this QSC converter.
Secondly, the control part: CPLD-based digital controller
is shown in Fig.1 below, which is composed of
Verilog-code-based CPLD, ADC/DAC chips, crystal oscillator,
and low-pass filter. From the view of controller signal flow,
the feedback signal of the converter: output ov is sent into
the OP-amp low-pass filter for high-frequency noise rejection,
and next the filtered signal is transferred into the digital form
by an ADC chip. Then, the filtered/digitalized output is sent
into the CPLD chip, and then compared with the desired
output reference (selected by the multiple output choice) to
produce the digital-form control signal GSv . Next, with the
DAC chips, this digital-form control signal GSv is
transferred back into the analog form, and then to adjust the
drain current Di (IQSA/IQSB of QSA/QSB) for the
capacitor voltage regulation of two cells. So, the
Verilog-code-based CPLD chip has two tasks to do: (1). the
dynamic production of the digital-form control signal GSv
according to both the filtered/digitalized output and the desired
output reference, and (2). the static generation of the
timing-control signals of QSC converter cells according to the
scheduled operation of Fig.3. Here, by using Verilog
programming, the CPLD-based digital controller has a more
flexible, simple and reliable design process for multiple output
choice.
2.2 Formulation of QSC Converter:
By increasing the number of capacitors of two cells in
Fig.2, a circuit configuration of n-stage QSC step-down
Fig.4 n-stage QSC step-down DC-DC converter
formulation of (1), around one static operating point, all
voltages and currents are divided into two parts: static
operating points and dynamic small signals as:

)(ˆV)( o tvtv oO  , )(ˆV)( GS tvtv gsGS  , (2e,f)
where GSoDCoCbCa V,V,I,V,V,V represent the static
signals, and gsodCoCbCa vvivvv ˆ,ˆ,ˆ,ˆ,ˆ,ˆ are the dynamic small
signals. By substituting states variation 0)(' tx of (1), the
steady-state output oV and oI can be shown as

GSDoo )V(IVI tL VKnnR  , (3b)
where K is the process parameter of MOSFET, and tV is
the threshold voltage. Here, it is notable that both output
voltage oV and output current oI are not function of source
SV . In other words, when the source SV is decreasing a little,
such a source variation cannot affect output oV & oI
immediately. Since SV is not directly connected to the load
LR at any half-cycle of period, the variation of source SV
will not make any immediate response on output oV and oI .
That is a very excellent advantage for QSC converter, so it
could have better output robustness against source variation or
noise. Based on the conclusion of (3), the steady-state
input/output power of QSC converter can be computed as:

Next, around some static operating point, followed by

suggested in Equation (7):

where gsmd vgi ˆˆ  ,and KKgm DI2  is the trans-
conductance. If the QSC step-down converter is regarded as an
open-loop plant of control system, then its small-signal
open-loop model has been derived here with two forms of:
state-space and transfer function expression as Equations
(6)~(7). Next, some compensation techniques can be applied,
for examples, PID compensator or state-feedback controller, to
form a closed-loop feedback control system for more excellent
response performances.
3. 系統控制原理
First of all, before the closed-loop design, let’s take a look
at the stability of the open-loop QSC converter. Obviously, for
the better power efficiency, the applied value of load resistance
LR is supposed to be much larger than value of parasitic
Tr , Cr , Cor . So, the assumption of CL rR  , CoL rR  ,
TL rR  is supposed to be accepted basically. In fact, the
resistance value of load LR is about in -level, and the
value range of parasitic Tr , Cr , Cor is about in m -level.
Around some operating point of GSV , the open-loop
two-order transfer function of (7) can be approximately
reduced into the open-loop one-order transfer function model
with one dominant pole as:

 (8b)
It is obvious that the open-loop QSC step-down converter is
locally stable because this dominant pole is located in the left
half of s-plane. Furthermore, the variation of operating point of
GSV will not directly affect the location of the dominant pole,
so the result almost ensures the global stability of the
open-loop QSC converter. Thus, it is one of advantages that
the converter scheme has an inherent good stability.
Next, let’s discuss the closed-loop control design and
implementation of the QSC converter. First for steady-state
regulation, according to (3a), the steady-state output voltage
oV is linearly regulated by drain current DI , which is
controlled by the gate-source voltage GSV . Thus, for the aim
to steady-state voltage regulation, it is desired that the
steady-state output voltage oV can follow reference refV
by adjusting the gate-source GSV . Based on (3a), let oV be
identical to the desired refV , and then obtain the nonlinear
compensator f as (9) to produce the static gate-source voltage
GSV for achieving the steady-state regulation,

Secondly for the small-signal transient regulation,
according to (7), the small-signal output voltage ovˆ is with
two-order t ransfer funct ion of small-signal gate-
source voltage gsvˆ . Thus, for the aim to small-signal voltage
regulation, it would be better to employ the closed-loop
control for dynamic compensation of output ovˆ . As the
control scheme of Fig.1, a simple PI-type controller with
cut-off frequency Lw and proportional gain PK is applied
here to compensate the transient difference between output &
desired reference, even for some good performances, for

6. 結論
A simple QSC step-down DC-DC converter with multiple
output choice (9V/5V, 9V/3.3V, 9V/2V) is implemented by
using CPLD-based digital controller for a variety of low-power
output requirement (Specification: Input voltage: 7.0V~9.0V,
load range: 50~400Ohms). In this paper, an integrated digital
controller is designed and implemented via combination with
Verilog-code CPLD and ADC/DAC chips to achieve the
closed-loop control of QSC step-down DC-DC converter.
Such a Verilog-based CPLD can make controller design more
flexible, simple and reliable. Finally, the hardware experiments
are illustrated to show the efficacy of the scheme, where some
cases include: voltage conversion and output ripple percentage,
output robustness against source variation, and converter
regulation capability for loading variation.
The following advantages of the proposed scheme are
involved. (i) Since all the elements of QSC converter only
contain MOSFETS and capacitors, the uniform is helpful to
I.C. fabrication future. (ii) An interleaved current-mode

Fig.2 Power-Part: QSC Step-Down Converter
Thus, it is obvious that the output ov can be regulated
relative to how much the capacitors are charged by
controlled current source. Fig.3 shows the theoretical
current waveforms of this QSC converter.
Secondly, the control part: CPLD-based digital
controller is shown in Fig.1 below, which is composed of
Verilog-code-based CPLD, ADC/DAC chips, crystal
oscillator, and low-pass filter. From the view of controller
signal flow, the feedback signal of the converter: output
ov is sent into the OP-amp low-pass filter for high-
frequency noise rejection, and next the filtered signal is
transferred into the digital form by an ADC chip. Then,
the filtered/digitalized output is sent into the CPLD chip,
and then compared with the desired output reference
(selected by the multiple output choice) to produce the
digital-form control signal GSv . Next, with the DAC
chips, this digital-form control signal GSv is transferred
back into the analog form, and then to adjust the drain
current Di (IQSA/IQSB of QSA/QSB) for the capacitor
voltage regulation of two cells. So, the Verilog-code-
based CPLD chip has two tasks to do: (1). the dynamic
production of the digital-form control signal GSv
according to both the filtered/digitalized output and the
desired output reference, and (2). the static generation of

according to the scheduled operation of Fig.3. Here, by
using Verilog programming, the CPLD-based digital
Fig.3 Theoretical current waveform
controller has a more flexible, simple and reliable design
process for multiple output choice.
2.2 FORMULATION OF QSC STEP-DOWN CONVERTER
By increasing the number of capacitors of two cells in
Fig.2, a circuit configuration of n-stage QSC step-down
DC-DC converter is suggested as shown in Fig.4 to
supply the load LR from the source SV . This n-stage
QSC converter is still composed of two n-stage cells A
and B in parallel between source SV and output oV . For
each cell, there includes n capacitors nC, CC 21 , & 3n-1
switches 1321 n-S,SS  (i.e., power or complementary
MOSFETS), where each capacitor has capacitance C
with equivalent series resistance (ESR) Cr , and similarly
the output capacitor has capacitance oC with ESR Cor ,
and MOSFETS 1321 n-S,SS  are operated as static
switches with the on-state resistance Tr .
According to the scheduled operation of Fig.3, it is
obvious that both cells A and B are basically operated in
anti-phase: when cell A is in the capacitor-charging
period, cell B is working in the capacitor-discharging
period, and vice versa. So, the duty cycle is fixed at 0.5
for each cell. Here, in the first half-cycle period, let QSA
be in pinch-off region as a controlled current source, turn
off SA & QSB, and turn on SB in triode region as a small
resistor. Then, n capacitors AnA CC ~1 of cell A are
linearly charged in series by the constant controlled
1654
Equations (6)~(7). Next, some compensation techniques
can be applied, for examples, PID compensator or state-
feedback controller, to form a closed-loop feedback
control system for more excellent response performances.
III. CONTROL DESIGN OF CPLD-BASED CONVERTER
First of all, before the closed-loop design, let’s take a
look at the stability of the open-loop QSC converter.
Obviously, for the better power efficiency, the applied
value of load resistance LR is supposed to be much larger
than value of parasitic Tr , Cr , Cor . So, the assumption of
CL rR  , CoL rR  , TL rR  is supposed to be accepted
basically. In fact, the resistance value of load LR is about
in -level, and the value range of parasitic Tr , Cr , Cor is
about in m -level. Around some operating point of GSV ,
the open-loop two-order transfer function of (7) can be
approximately reduced into the open-loop one-order
transfer function model with one dominant pole as:

pole


 . (8b)
It is obvious that the open-loop QSC step-down converter
is locally stable because this dominant pole is located in
the left half of s-plane. Furthermore, the variation of
operating point of GSV will not directly affect the
location of the dominant pole, so the result almost
ensures the global stability of the open-loop QSC
converter. Thus, it is one of advantages that the converter
scheme has an inherent good stability.
Next, let’s discuss the closed-loop control design and
implementation of the QSC converter. First for steady-
state regulation, according to (3a), the steady-state output
voltage oV is linearly regulated by drain current DI ,
which is controlled by the gate-source voltage GSV . Thus,
for the aim to steady-state voltage regulation, it is desired
that the steady-state output voltage oV can follow
reference refV by adjusting the gate-source GSV . Based
on (3a), let oV be identical to the desired refV , and then
obtain the nonlinear compensator f as (9) to produce the
static gate-source voltage GSV for achieving the steady-
state regulation,

f  refrefGS

)V(V . (9)
Secondly for the small-signal transient regulation,
according to (7), the small-signal output voltage ovˆ is
with two-order transfer function of small-signal gate-
source voltage gsvˆ . Thus, for the aim to small-signal
voltage regulation, it would be better to employ the
closed-loop control for dynamic compensation of output
ovˆ . As the control scheme of Fig.1, a simple PI-type
controller with cut-off frequency Lw and proportional
gain PK is applied here to compensate the transient
difference between output & desired reference, even for
some good performances, for example, rise time and
setting time. In this PI controller, there are two
parameters of Lw , PK , where the gain PK is designed for
tracking error compensation, and the cut-off frequency
Lw is designed for the possible high-frequency noise
rejection. Therefore, combining the ideas of steady-state
and transient control, the overall closed-loop control of
QSC step-down DC-DC converter can be presented as
shown in Fig.5, in which a voltage limiter of GSv is used
in order to protect the drain current not to be larger than
safe drain current of MOSFET.
Next, let’s look at CPLD controller implementation.
Here, an integrated digital controller is implemented via
combination with Verilog-code CPLD and ADC/DAC
/OSC/OP chips to achieve the closed-loop control of QSC
step-down converter with multiple output choice. From
the angle of signal flow of the digital controller, the
output signal ov of the converter gets in through the OP-
amp low-pass filter for the high frequency noise rejection,
and then the filtered analog output signal is transferred
into the digital form by the ADC chip. Then, the
digitalized output signal is sent into the CPLD chip and
compared with desired reference refV , and following to
produce the suitable digital-form control signal GSv .
Next, with the DAC chips, the digital-form control signal
GSv can be transferred into the analog form for the
adjustment of Di . The scheme of the digital controller is
shown in the Fig.1 below. In addition, the CPLD chip has
to handle the timing control of the converter in
accordance with the scheduled operation of Fig.3. Here,
by using Verilog programming, both control signal
production and timing control operation can be easily
realized and integrated in this CPLD chip.
IV. EXPERIMENT OF CPLD-BASED QSC CONVERTER
In this section, the hardware implementation and
experiment of the closed-loop CPLD-based QSC step-
down DC-DC converter is illustrated. The hardware
implementation of closed-loop QSC converter is shown
in the photo of Fig.6, and all the hardware elements are
listed in Table.1. Here, the core: CPLD chip has to not
only handle the control signal production, but also realize

Fig. 8(b) Steady output conversion (mode: 9V/3.3V)

Fig. 9(a) Steady Output while source variation (mode: 9V/2V)
Fig. 9(b) Steady Output while source variation (mode: 9V/3.3V)
Fig. 9(c) Steady Output while source variation (mode: 9V/5V)
(C). Finally, the regulation capability of the converter
with loading variation is discussed. Fig. 10(a) shows the
transient output waveform when the load is added in
double, i.e. the same load is added and connected in
parallel with the output terminals ( 200  100 ). Fig.
10(b) shows the transient output waveform when the
added load is removed away from the output terminals
( 100  200 ). From Fig. 10(a)~(b), it is obvious that
the output voltage can be still regulated to hold on about
V2 ( V2Vref  ) no matter when the extra load is added in
or removed away. Of course, ones can also find that the
output ripple becomes larger during the time interval of
supplying the heavier load. Besides, for the other output
choices ( 5VV,3.3Vref  ), the output regulation capability
can be also experimented and measured as shown in Fig.
10(c)~(f). In these figures, it is found that this converter
can still keep the outputs on about 5VV,3.3 respectively
in spite of the loading variation. So, by using this CPLD
digital controller, this closed-loop QSC converter has a
pretty good regulation capability.
V. CONCLUSIONS
A simple QSC step-down DC-DC converter with
multiple output choice (9V/5V, 9V/3.3V, 9V/2V) is
implemented by using CPLD-based digital controller for
a variety of low-power output requirement (Specification:
Input voltage: 7.0V~9.0V, load range: 50~400Ohms). In
this paper, an integrated digital controller is designed and
implemented via combination with Verilog-code CPLD
and ADC/DAC chips to achieve the closed-loop control
