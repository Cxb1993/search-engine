metalorganic chemical vapor deposition 
(MOCVD) have been successfully applied in 
mercurial optical and electronic devices [1, 2]. 
The polar of GaN controlled has been 
demonstrated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
exercising different nucleation steps or buffer 
layers [3, 4]. The resulting layers have been 
reported to have rather poor quality compared 
with Ga-polarity GaN layers. To explore fully the 
potential functions and applications of 
III-nitrides, the growth on various polar of GaN 
by MOCVD is important. The improvement of 
p-type GaN conductivity is one of the most 
important issues for the development of these 
devices. Magnesium (Mg) is the most commonly 
used dopant for obtaining p-type GaN. Different 
polarity can not only impact growth kinetics but 
also affecting the characteristics of p-type GaN 
since these planes have different structures. Up to 
now, minority reported on the p-type GaN 
growth for N-polarity GaN layer. 
In this study, Mg implantation characteristics 
in Ga- and N-polarities GaN layers grown by 
MOCVD have been systematically investigated. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence 
(PL) were used to observe crystalline structural 
and optical characteristics. Different elements 
distributed in each layer of as-grown layers were 
measured by second ion mass spectrometry 
(SIMS). Electrical properties were compared 
with those of the Mg implantation into various 
polarities GaN layers by Hall measurement. 
 
三、研究方法 
 The GaN films used in this study were grown 
on c-face ( 0001 ) sapphire substrates by MOCVD. 
Ttrimethylgallium (TMGa), ammonia (NH3) and 
trimethylaluminum (TMAl) were used as the 
sources of gallium, nitrogen and aluminum, 
respectively. The carrier gas is hydrogen (H2), 
and the growth pressure is 100 Torr. The 
substrate was initially heat to 1100°C in H2 
ambient for cleaning the surface of substrate and 
the lower to 550°C to grow a 30 nm-thick 
low-temperature GaN buffer layer. Then, the 
temperature was subsequently raised to 1000°C 
to grow a 2-µm-thick undoped GaN layer. 
Afterwards, the TMAl is introduced to reverse 
the Ga-polarity to N-polarity of GaN. Finally, 1 
µm-thick undoped GaN epilayer was deposited 
on the top on the Al intermediate layer. 
Conventional MOCVD grown 2 µm-thick 
undoped GaN film without Al intermediate layer 
was also prepared under the same growth 
conditions. SIMS depth profile analysis was 
performed to observe material composition. After 
growth, these two as-grown samples are 
immersed into 10N-KOH for 5minutes to 
identify the lattice polarity. 
The as-grown samples with and without Al 
intermediate layer were then implanted with Mg 
using multiple implantation technology, and 
denoted the sample A and B, respectively. Mg 
ions were implanted with the total doses of 
1.5×1015 cm-2 (40keV/1.5×1014 cm-2, 100keV/ 
4×1014 cm-2 and 200keV/9.5×1014 cm-2) to 
produce a uniform concentrations of 5×1019 cm-3 
with a depth of ~0.3µm. After implantation, 
samples were annealed in N2 ambient at 
1100℃~1200℃ for various times capped with an 
undoped GaN wafer in a face-to-face geometry. 
XRD was employed to characterize the as-grown, 
after etching and post-implantation annealing 
samples. Optical and electrical properties were 
compared with those of the Mg implantation into 
various polarities GaN layers by PL and Hall 
measurements. 
 
四、主要結果 
  Figure 1 shows the measured SIMS profiles 
of Ga, N and Al for these two as-grown samples. 
It was found that the presence of Al in the region 
of 1 µm for sample with Al intermediate layer, 
but not to be observed for sample without Al

compound semiconductors. Figures 2(a) and (b) 
show the typical ω-scan (rocking curve) XRD 
curves of the annealed sample A and sample B, 
respectively. Both samples were annealed at 
1100  for various periods of 10s℃ , 20s, and at 
1200  for 10s℃ , respectively. It can be found 
obviously that the smallest XRD ω-scan 
full-width-half-maximum (FWHMs) were 
obtained by post-implantation annealing at 
1200℃, 10s for both sample A and B. In addition, 
the FWHM of sample A after annealing at 
1200  for 10s ℃ was 0.075°. Such a value was 
much smaller than the 0.095° XRD ω-scan 
FWHM observed from the sample B annealed at 
1200  for 10s℃ . The observed results suggest that 
the implanted samples were to be annealed at 
1200  for 10s℃  to achieve a sufficient recovery 
of crystal quality and sample A after an 
appropriate annealing treatment have a better 
crystal quality than sample B.  
Figures 3(a) and (b) show the 10K PL spectra 
of sample A and sample B annealed at various 
conditions, respectively. It could be seen that the 
PL spectrum of sample A after annealing at 
1200  for 10s℃  exhibits an intense 
acceptor-bound exciton (I1) emission at 3.46eV, 
and a donor-acceptor-pair (DAP) transition at 
3.27 eV followed by two LO phonon replicas 
with ~90meV separation [7]. In contrast, a very 
weak I1 line was observed from the sample B 
annealed at 1200℃ for 10s. Besides, a notorious 
yellow band (YB) emission [8] appears at 2.3eV 
for sample B and was much higher than sample 
A. The much stronger PL intensity and the fact 
that no YB emissions were observed both 
suggest a high quality GaN layer can be achieved 
by annealing at 1200℃, 10s for sample A. These 
PL characteristics were in reasonable agreement 
with the observed results by XRD measurements. 
Hall measurement exhibits the sample A and 
sample B after annealing at 1100℃ regardless of 
10s or 20s, which remain n-type conductivity. Up 
to annealing at 1200 ℃ for 10s, the sample A 
convert their conductivity to p-type, but the 
sample B still remains n-type conductivity. This 
phenomena could be attributed to the enhanced 
Mg atoms substitution since N-polarity layer 
have more Ga vacancies, and eventually achieve 
p-type conductive characteristics for the Mg 
implanted N-polarity GaN layer after an 
appropriate annealing treatment.
