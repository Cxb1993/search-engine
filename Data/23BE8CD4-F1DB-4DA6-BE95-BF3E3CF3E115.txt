21. Introduction
Recently, a lot of one-dimensional
(1-D) inorganic nanostructures have been
prepared and widely investigated due to
their potential in practical industrial uses.
However, only very few studies concerning
the synthesis of organic nanowires have
been reported. Copper phthalocyanine
(CuPc) and Tris(8-hydroxylquinoline)
gallium (III) (Gaq3) with special electrical
and optical properties are very popular
organic materials applied in several areas.
For instance, CuPc is one type of organic
semiconductor whose electrical and optical
properties have been studied extensively due
to its widespread applications in
photovoltaic cell, gas sensor, optical storage,
optical switch, and field effect transistor
[1-5]. Gaq3 has been considered in OLEDs
architectures by Burrows et al. [6]. It was
reported that OLEDs containing Gaq3
exhibited higher electroluminescence yield
than that based on Alq3 [8]. For these
applications, the efficiency and sensitivity
of the devices are mostly proportional to the
surface area of the organics. Therefore, by
preparation of nanostructures of CuPc and
Gaq3, a high surface area of the materials
can be easily obtained. In this study,
nanostructures of CuPc and Gaq3 were
prepared by thermal evaporation. The
effects of experimental parameters on
growth of the nanostructures and their
optical properties were investigated.
2. Experimental
2-1 Fabrication of CuPc nanostructures
The organic vapor-phase deposition
system consisted of a vertical glass chamber
evacuated to a pressure of 10-4 Pa. The
pressure of working gas was controlled by a
capacitance gauge. A graphite boat held by
two graphite electrodes was used as a
resistive heater. A DC electric current was
supplied by a transformer, and its current
was controlled by the temperature controller.
Argon and helium ranged from 1.33 kPa (10
torr) to 13.3 kPa (100 torr) served as the
working gas. A silicon substrate with (100)
growth direction was fixed under a
concaved stainless steel cold trap on the
upside of the chamber, and CuPc powder
was placed on the graphite boat under the
substrate with a distance of 10 cm. The
heating rate of the graphite boat was set at
56.5 K/min, and the evaporation
temperature was set at 848K. During the
evaporation process, liquid nitrogen (LN2)
was added into the cold trap for rapid
cooling of the substrate. After the
evaporation procedure, a heat treatment was
carried out in the same chamber. The
as-prepared CuPc nanostructure went
through different thermal treatments with
nitrogen as the buffer gas at 6.7 kPa (50
torr). The heating temperature was 473 K or
573 K, and the annealing time ranged from
1 h to 2 h. A Hitachi spectrometer (Model
U-3010) was used to study the optical
properties of CuPc. The UV-visible
absorption spectra were measured, and the
optical band gaps were calculated.
2-2 Fabrication of Gaq3 nanostructures
Gaq3 nanostructures were also
prepared by a thermal evaporation system.
The working gas was Helium. The working
4nanowires with lengths of 300 and 600 nm,
respectively. Fig. 8s (d), (e), and (f)) are
nanospheres with diameters of 200, 600, and
1000 nm, respectively. The Gaq3 raw
material shown in Fig. 8 (a) is taken as a
reference. The PL spectra of the six samples
show very broad peaks in Fig 8. The Gaq3
raw material exhibits an emission maximum
at 518 nm. All of (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f)
exhibited emission maxima at ca. 511nm.
No matter they were nanowires or
nanospheres and bigger or smaller in size,
the PL emission maxima are almost the
same. One thing worth mentioning is that all
of the fabricated Gaq3 nanostructures are
about 10 nm red-shift to the Gaq3 raw
material. The morphology and size do not
influence the PL peaks, indicating that the
quantum confinement effect is not
significant.
