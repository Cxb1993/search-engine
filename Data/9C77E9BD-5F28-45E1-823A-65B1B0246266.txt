Abstract
Using the replica method, originally developed in statistical physics, we derive the asymp-
totic mutual information of a spatially correlated Rician multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) multiple-access (MA) channel for any given signaling input distributions (not
necessarily Gaussian) in the large-system regime where the numbers of antennas at the
transmitters and the receiver go to infinity with a constant ratio. In addition to the result
that uses joint optimum decoding (JOD) at the central receiver, we also obtain the asymp-
totic mutual information of a more practical system which performs separate detection and
decoding (SDD) (i.e., spatial detection followed by a temporal error-correction decoder).
Simulation results reveal that the asymptotic results provide promising estimates for the
average mutual information even with only a few antenna elements at the transceivers.

1. 計畫的緣由與目的
Since the seminal works by Foschini et al. [1] and Telatar [2], it is widely recog-
nized that multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels provide enormous potential
for enhancing the spectral efficiency of wireless communications. In particular, consider-
able attention so far has been paid on understanding the theoretical capacity of MIMO
channels under realistic settings [3–6]. From the practical perspectives, knowing the mu-
tual information of a given channel is important to the design of capacity-approaching
codes [7, 8] and power control schemes [9].
Further to the previous results, this work studies a spatially correlated MIMO multiple-
access (MA) channel where several multi-antenna users are transmitting to a common
multi-antenna receiver. The spatial correlation between the transmitters and the re-
ceivers of the channel is assumed to be separable. The channel is also assumed to have
a direct line-of-sight (LOS) and in Rician fading. Our aim is to understand the average
mutual information of this general type of channel, which quantifies its achievable rates
at which error-free communication is permitted.
Getting analytical expressions for the average mutual information of finite-size MIMO
channels is challenging and even for single-user MIMO systems is sometimes unsolvable
(e.g., [10–12]). In [10], the exact expression for the average mutual information of an
uncorrelated Rician MIMO channel was obtained. However, when spatial correlations
exist at the transmitter or receiver, only upper and lower bounds were possible [11,12].
Asymptotic techniques on the other hand give an alternative to circumvent the math-
ematical difficulties and have been widely used. In this context, some recent works,
e.g., [13–23], have been performed with the assumption that the numbers of antennas at
the transmitter and receiver go to infinity with a constant ratio. One successful example
for this large-system analysis is the use of random matrix theory (e.g., [14, 15]). In par-
ticular, using the Stieltjes transform of large random matrix theory in [16], Dumont et al.
analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the mutual information of a Rician MIMO fading
channel with receive spatial correlation [17]. The result was later extended to the channel
with both transmit and receive, but separable, spatial correlation in [18].
Another approach to study a large system is the replica method, which was origi-
nally developed in statistical physics to study disordered systems [19] and has since been
widely employed in a variety of information processing problems, see [20]. For instance,
Moustakas et al., in [21] and recently [22], showed that the asymptotic mutual informa-
tion for both uncorrelated Rician MIMO channel and spatially-correlated Rayleigh MIMO
channel converges to Gaussian random variables with their means and variances derived.
Most recently in [23], Taricco derived the statistics for the asymptotic mutual informa-
tion of a separately-correlated Rician MIMO channel, and these results have also been
extended to the case with co-channel interference in [24]. Nevertheless, the asymptotic
results regarding Rician MIMO fading channels so far are limited to single-user systems
of Gaussian distributed inputs. Despite the importance of Gaussian inputs in achieving
the capacity, practical inputs are unlikely to be Gaussian such as quaternary phase shift
keying (QPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Thus, to understand the
limits of practical systems, the mutual information with constellation inputs is a better
reference [25,26].
The main difficulty of deriving the mutual information of non-Gaussian inputs is that

2. 系統模型與問題定義
We consider a MIMO-MA system with K users, each respectively with M1, . . . ,MK
transmit antennas communicating to an N -antenna central receiver. The received signal
at the base station is written in vector form as
y =
K∑
k=1
Hkxk + σu ≡ Hx + σu, (2.1)
where y ∈ CN is the received signal vector, Hk ∈ CN×Mk is the channel matrix between
the kth transmitter and the base station receiver, xk ∈ CMk is the transmitted symbol
vector from user k with its distribution denoted by p(xk), u ∈ CN is the complex Gaussian
noise vector with zero mean and a covariance matrix of I so that σ2 denotes the noise
power, and we have defined H , [H1 H2 · · · HK ] and x ,
[
xT1 x

for notational
convenience.
The channel is considered to be separable, spatially correlated [3, 4] and in Rician
multi-path fading, so that

correlation matrices for the lth path of user k so that Lk denotes the number of paths
for user k, Wk,l ∈ CN×Mk denotes the channel components that are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean unit-variance complex Gaussian entries, and
H¯k ∈ CN×Mk corresponds to the LOS component of the user k’s channel. Without loss of
generality, we assume that Tk,l, Rk,l and H¯k are all normalized in such a way that

In (3.5), the expectation is taken over p(z,x|√Ξ) while in (3.6), it is taken over p(x|z,√Ξ)
which can be obtained from p(x) and the channel conditional distribution (3.4) through
the Bayes’ formula.
Proof: See Chapter 3.3. 
The fixed-point equations in (3.5) may have multiple solutions. Among them, the
one that gives the smallest value of (3.3) corresponds to the mutual information of the
channel. The fact that there are more than one solutions in (3.5) (also known as the
metastable solutions in the field of statistical physics) is known as the phenomenon of
phase coexistence [20,29]. In fact, some metastable states may provide a result exceeding
the limit of the actual capacity. Thus, it is important that the one that minimizes (3.3)
is chosen. Note also that the metastable states have a rich operational meaning from
physics. For more details, the interested readers are referred to see [29].
With a given input signaling distribution, the spectral efficiency of the MIMO-MA
system under joint optimum decoding (JOD) is equal to the mutual information of the
MIMO-MA channel [44]. Thus, Proposition 1 provides the asymptotic spectral efficiency
of the MIMO-MA system with JOD, which jointly decodes all the data from the received
signals [45]. Nonetheless, a more practical receiver structure is separate detection and de-
coding (SDD) where a spatial decorrelator is preceded with temporal error-correction de-
coders. In particular, we consider that in SDD, the minimum mean square error (MMSE)
detector frontend feeds soft/hard decisions to temporal error-correction decoders. The

where the notation [A|k] returns the sub-matrix of A obtained by extracting the elements
of the rows and columns with indices from
∑k−1
i=1 Mi + 1 to
∑k
i=1 Mi. With (3.10), it can
be shown (see e.g., [45]) that the received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR)
for the mth MMSE filter output for user k is given by
γm,k =

]
(m,k)

with [·](m,k) returning the

th diagonal element. Using Proposition 2, we
then qualify the achievable rate of user k when SDD is used for spatially correlated Rician
MIMO-MA channels as
∑Mk
m=1 log(1 + γm,k).
Note that as p(x) is postulated to be Gaussian at the receiver, we get the linear
MMSE detector
xˆ = (H†H + σ2I)−1Hy (3.14)
regardless of the actual input distributions. In what follows, (3.10) can be directly ob-
tained from the equivalent Gaussian vector channel (3.8). As a consequence, (3.10)–(3.12)
are true even for non-Gaussian signaling inputs as long as p(x) is assumed to be Gaussian
at the receiver.
As shown previously, the first term of (3.3) can be recognized as the mutual infor-
mation between x and z for the vector Gaussian channel (3.8), and can thus be found as
log det (I + Ξ). Substituting this into (3.3), we obtain

K = Lk = 1, the result is reduced to that in [18,23,40], where ς1,1 and ε1,1 have a unique
solution to the fixed-point equations.
Chapter 3.3: Proof of Proposition 1
First of all, we define

independent, we can show that

k=1 Vk is a Gaussian random matrix with mean V¯ ,∑K
k=1 H¯kxk and covariance Q⊗R ,
∑K
k=1
∑Lk
l=1 Qk,l⊗Rk,l. Applying Identity 1 (see the
footnote2) with −A†1 = A2 = Q−1V¯†R−1, and A3 ⊗A4 = Σ ⊗ I + Q−1 ⊗R−1, we can
eliminate V, resulting in
eG

(r + 1)N det (I + QΣ⊗R)EX
[
evec(V¯)
†[(Q⊗R)−1((QΣ⊗R+I)−1−I)]vec(V¯)
]
. (3.27)
On the other hand, we can show that if M →∞, the rate measure of µ(r)(Q) is given
as [36]
R(r)(Q) =
K∑
k=1
max
Q˜k

e
∑Lk
l=1 Tr(Q˜k,lX
†
kTk,lXk)
]}
, (3.28)
where Q˜k,l ∈ C(r+1)×(r+1) is a symmetric matrix, and Q˜k , {Q˜k,l}∀l. In the large deviation
theory, R(r) is usually regarded as the rate-function of the probability measure µ(r)(Q)
as M → ∞ [48]. As a result, by applying the method of steepest descent to (3.22), we
have [29,33]
lim
M→∞
log Ey,H [Z
r(y,H)] ≈ F (r) , max
Q
[G(r)(Q)−R(r)(Q)] . (3.29)
With (3.22), one may establish that the error
(
log Ey,H [Z
r(y,H)]−F (r)) is of order O(1).
Therefore, the approximation in (3.29) should be made an equality by normalizing with
M on both sides. However, as mentioned in Section III-A, for practical reasons, we do not
use this normalization factor and the limitation. As such, the result in our propositions is
an asymptotic approximation. In addition, it should be noted that in (3.28) and (3.29),
the correct order is M → ∞ after r → 0, but we take the limit M → ∞ first so that
the steepest descent method can be applied [20]. As in [29,33], the assumption about the
exchange of limits M →∞ and r → 0 is used without proof.
Combining (3.27), (3.28), and (3.29), the saddle-point asymptotic approximation of
F (r) is given by

Now, we decouple the first quadratic term in the exponent of (3.35) by using Hubbard-

Furthermore, motivated by the first term of (3.38) in the exponent, we can define a vector
Gaussian channel (3.8). The conditional distribution of the vector Gaussian channel is
given as (3.4) in Proposition 1. Upon the observation of the output z, the optimal estimate
of x in mean-square sense is xˆ = Ex
[
x
∣∣∣z,√Ξ], where the expectation is taken over the
posteriori distribution of the channel p
(
x
∣∣∣z,√Ξ), which can be found by the Bayes’
formula:
p

where p

we obtain F , an asymptotic approximation of F , Proposition 1 can be easily proved. The
parameters εk,l and ςk,l are determined by equating the partial derivatives of F to zeros.

Computer simulations have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the asymp-
totic mutual information formula (3.3), and the performance of the spatially correlated
Rician MIMO-MA channels via the equivalent Gaussian vector channel in (3.8). For the
simulations, we have assumed that the spatial correlation is generated from an uniform
linear array with half wavelength spacing in a wireless scenario where there is one propa-
gation path cluster with Gaussian power azimuthal distribution having mean angle of θk,l
and angular spread of δk,l. Specifically, we take the correlation matrix with elements [13]

Chapter 4.1 Accuracy of (3.3)
In the following discussion, we compare the analytical results in (3.3) and the Monte-
Carlo simulation results (3.2) obtained from averaging over a large number of independent
realizations of H. First, consider the single-user MIMO channel (i.e., the so-called ideal
channel) with QPSK inputs, where K = 1, L1 = 1, R1,1 = T1,1 = I, and [H¯1]i,j = 1 ∀i, j.
To have a better indication on the rate of convergence, we specifically plot the normalized
asymptotic mutual information results (normalized by the number of antennas M1) in
Figure 4.1. Results demonstrate that the asymptotic results do converge to the exact
results, but not quite as fast as commonly observed in the cases with Gaussian distributed
inputs, if the number of antennas increases. In addition, by comparing the results in

Abstract—In this paper, we study the transmit precoding prob-
lem for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-hop amplify-
and-forward (AF) relay systems, where the source terminal (ST),
relay terminal (RT), and destination terminal (DT) are equipped
with multiple correlated antennas and there exists a direct link
between ST and DT. It is assumed that DT has perfect channel
state information (CSI) while ST and RT only have the channel
covariance information (CCI). We derive the asymptotic mutual
information (MI) expressions for the MIMO-AF relay channel
for any given signaling input distributions in the large-system
limit. Using the asymptotic results, we design the optimal source
covariance matrix and the relay precoding matrix that maximizes
the asymptotic MI of the system if CCI is exploited.
I. INTRODUCTION
Extensive research works have demonstrated that multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can provide extraordi-
nary capacity over wireless channels. In recent years, cooper-
ation techniques with the aid of relay terminals (RTs) on the
other hand have emerged to become a promising solution for
further enhancing the channel capacity [1]. Among various
relaying schemes, the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol is
attractive due to its relative simplicity in implementation.
Recent results in [2, 3] showed that the throughput of MIMO
relay systems can be greatly enhanced by properly designed
precoding matrices. In their works, however, perfect channel
state information (CSI) is required at the source terminal (ST)
and the relaying terminal (RT). In contrast, precoding design
based on the channel covariance information (CCI) appears to
be more tractable [4]. Motivated by this, this paper aims to
study the optimal precoding matrices at the ST and RT that
maximize the expected mutual information (MI) of MIMO AF
relay systems when CCI is exploited at the ST and RT.
The difficulty of such design lies in the derivation of the
expected MI of MIMO relay channels (for recent results, see
[5]). Large-system approaches have been widely employed to
circumvent the mathematical obstacles. In [6], the asymptotic
mean and variance of the MI for spatially correlated MIMO
relay channels were obtained when the direct link between ST
and DT is weak enough to be ignored. Recently, an expression
for the asymptotic MI was presented in [7] for multi-level AF
relay networks, in which the noise at the RTs was ignored.

In this paper, we provide the asymptotic MI expression of
MIMO relay channels for any given signaling inputs in the
large-system regime where the numbers of antennas at the
ST, RT, and DT all go to infinity with constant ratios. The
direct link is also taken into account. Based on the asymptotic
results, we provide a few characteristics on the structures of
the asymptotically optimal transmit signal covariance matrix
and relay precoding matrix when only the CCI is available. In
addition, we devise an iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal
precoding matrices that maximize the asymptotic MI.

Abstract— In this paper, we study the transmit precoding
problem for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-
access (MA) cellular systems employing cooperative base sta-
tions (BSs) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying where the
antennas at the user equipments (UEs), relay terminals (RTs),
and BSs are correlated. It is assumed that BSs have perfect
channel state information (CSI) while user equipments (UEs)
and RTs only have the channel covariance information (CCI). We
derive the asymptotic sum-rate expressions for the MIMO-MA
cellular systems for any given signaling input distributions in the
large-system limit. Using the asymptotic results, we propose an
efficient algorithm to determine the asymptotic optimum transmit
matrices for the UEs and RTs that can maximize the sum-rate
of the MIMO-MA cellular systems if CCI is exploited at the UEs
and RTs.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
antenna systems, there is a paradigm shift from single user
point-to-point systems to multiuser cellular networks [1], in
which multiple user equipments (UEs) are transmitting to
multiple base station (BS) receivers. In cellular networks,
multiuser interference becomes the dominated limitation factor
in the channel capacity. To manage the multiuser interference,
BS cooperation is a promising solution. In the recent literature,
BS cooperation usually refers to multi-cell processing that
allows cooperation and joint processing among the BSs (also
known as distributed antenna systems) [2–5]. On the other
hand, communications with the aid of amplify-and-forward
(AF) relaying in recent years have emerged to become a
feasible technique for further enhancing the throughput of
cellular systems [6]. As shown in Fig. 1, in this paper, we thus
focus on a wireless scenario of the uplink multiuser MIMO
multiple-access (MA) system where multiple BSs cooperate to
perform the multi-cell processing and AF operating RTs are
employed to assist the communication between the UEs and
the BSs.
Previous works showed that the throughput of MIMO sys-
tems can be greatly enhanced by properly designed precoding
matrices [7–9]. Given the perfect transmitter and receiver
channel state information (CSI), [7] proposed an iterative
water-filling algorithm to find the input signal covariance

matrices for all UEs for sum-rate maximization of a MIMO-
MA system. However, in most of wireless communications,
it seems to be more realistic to assume that only the channel
covariance information (CCI) is known at the transmitter sides
[10]. Motivated by this, this paper addresses the optimization
problem of UE covariance matrices and RT precoding matrices
for maximizing the expected sum-rate of the MIMO-MA
cellular systems when only the CCI is exploited at the UE
transmitters and the RTs.
The challenge of such a design lies in the derivation of
the expected sum-rate of MIMO-MA cellular systems. Large-
system approaches (referred to asymptotic approaches, in
this paper) have been widely employed to circumvent the
mathematical obstacles [11, 12]. In [4, 5], the asymptotic sum-
rate of MIMO-MA cellular systems without relaying were
On the Ergodic Capacity of Jointly-Correlated
Rician Fading MIMO Channels
Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin, Kai-Kit Wong, Jung-Chieh Chen, and Pangan Ting
Abstract—In this paper, we study the capacity-achieving input
covariance matrices for the jointly-correlated (or the Weichsel-
berger) Rician fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
antenna channel when perfect channel state information (CSI) is
known at the receiver while only statistical CSI at the transmitter
is available. Unlike the Kronecker model, such jointly-correlated
MIMO channel accounts for the correlation coupled between the
two ends and has been shown to be most accurate for representing
real channels. Our contribution includes the expression for the
asymptotic mutual information for the jointly-correlated Rician
fading MIMO channel in the large-system regime in which the
numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver go to infinity
with a fixed ratio. Based on this expression, an efficient algorithm
is also proposed to obtain the capacity-achieving input covariance
matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that even for a moderate
number of antennas at each end, the proposed scheme provides
undistinguishable results as those obtained by the highly-complex
stochastic programming (or Monte-Carlo based) approach.
Keywords—Asymptotic analysis, MIMO antennas, ergodic ca-
pacity, statistical eigenmode transmission.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the seminal works by Foschini et al. [1] and Telatar
[2], it has been widely recognized that multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) channels can enhance greatly the spectral effi-
ciency of wireless communications. In particular, considerable
attention so far has been paid on understanding the capacity
of MIMO channels under various realistic settings [3, 4].
In this paper, we aim to address the problem of optimizing
the input covariance matrix that maximizes the average mutual
information of a realistic MIMO channel. Typically, accurate
channel state information (CSI) at the receiver side (or CSIR)
is achievable through periodic training. However, in practice,
the CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) is limited by factors such as
the time-varying nature of wireless channels, feedback delay,
CSI quantization, and etc. To devise transceiver designs that
are robust to errors in CSIT, statistical modeling approaches,
e.g., [5], are typical and they can generally guarantee certain
system performance averaged over the channel realizations.
Input covariance matrix design exploiting statistical CSIT
highly depends upon the channel model. Arguably, the most

widely-used model is the separately-correlated (or the Kro-
necker) MIMO model [3], which, however, has been unable
to reflect practical channel properties [6]. Several improved
models have been proposed, which includes the virtual channel
model [7], the unitary-independent-unitary (UIU) model [4],
and the Weichselberger model [8]. The Weichselberger model
is the powerful one which not only accounts for the correla-
tion at both ends but also models their mutual dependence.
Analytical results for such model are, however, limited, with
a recent attempt in [10] under a strong assumption that the
Rician fading component shares the same eigenvector structure
as the Rayleigh fading component of the channel.
Motivated by the huge success of large-system approaches
in analyzing the ergodic mutual information of MIMO chan-
nels, e.g., [11], this paper uses large-system analysis to investi-
gate the asymptotic mutual information for the Weichselberger
MIMO channel. In summary, our contributions are:
• We study the fluctuations of the mutual information of
the Weichselberger MIMO channel in the large-system
regime. In particular, we provide an explicit expression
of the asymptotic mean and variance. Simulation results
will show that, even for systems with only a few antennas
at both ends, the derived results provide reliable results
in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
• In addition, we devise an iterative algorithm to obtain the
asymptotic-optimal input covariance matrix that achieves
the ergodic capacity of the Weichselberger MIMO chan-
nel. Simulation results will reveal that our asymptotic ap-
proach provides undistinguishable results to direct maxi-
mization approaches of the average mutual information.
To the best of our knowledge, any analytical results for
this problem are new. A merit of our asymptotic analysis
is therefore to provide an analytical means for finding the
asymptotic-optimal input covariance matrix.

感謝國科會通過兩年期的計畫，使得我們得以有較為足夠的時間，將計畫具體實行。本計
畫執行結果與原計畫書之規劃大致上相符、預定達成的目標也都有順利達成。預期達成目
標包括系統模型的建立、文獻的收集研讀、理論的分析、電腦系統的模擬與數值分析、人
員的訓練、和經驗的傳承等等皆有非常好的成效。 
總體而言，本計畫執行上十分順利，主要執行成果已發表在國際期刊與國際研討會上，累
計成果有：二篇國際期刊、三篇國際研討會論文、一篇國內會議論文邀稿。所發表刊物名
稱、卷期及出版日期如下：
