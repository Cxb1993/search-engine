2.3 Specifications and Definitions of LDO 
 
In this section, the fundamental concepts of LDO are described. The basic definitions of LDO include the 
categories of LDO, dropout voltage, load regulation, line regulation, ground current, efficiency, equivalent 
series resistance (ESR) of the output capacitor, and accuracy of LDO output voltage [18][19]. 
2.3.1 Dropout Voltage 
Dropout voltage is one of the most important features in a LDO voltage regulator. Dropout voltage is 
defined as the minimum input-to-output voltage difference 
where output voltage of the LDO linear regulators remains regulated. Figure 2.5 shows a typical 
input/output voltage characteristic of LDO linear regulators [18][19]. It can be seen that when Vin is not very 
large, the output voltage is no longer regulated. In this low-Vin operating region, it is usually called as 
“dropout region”. As the input voltage Vi is bigger than V2, the regulator gets into the regulation region, 
where the output voltage remains regulated. In the regulation region, the output voltage is almost 
independent of the variations of input voltage or load current. The dropout voltage is mainly related to the 
architecture of the error amplifier and the output pass element. Take an output pass element of a PMOS as 
an example, the pass element’s I-V characteristic is determined by the feature size of this PMOS and the 
lowest output voltage of the error amplifier which gives the largest VGS to the PMOS. As a result, once the 
feature size of the PMOS and the architecture of the error amplifier are determined, the dropout voltage is 
also determined and can be found with the PMOS’s I-V characteristic and load line [7].

Fig. 2.5Input/Output Voltage Characteristics of a linear Regulator 
 
Since the power consumption is proportional to the product of the voltage difference and conducting 
current, a lower dropout voltage can make a LDO dissipate less power in itself. For example, assume that a 
LDO with a dropout voltage of 0.3 volts is operating near dropout region and its output current is 200 mA. 
Then the power consumption in the output pass element is 0.3 V×200 mA 60 mW. With re-chargeable 
batteries, its voltage varies over its useful lifetime. With a low dropout voltage, the LDO can be used to 
extend the battery usage time. In low power circuit system, a low dropout voltage is preferred in linear 
regulators and this is one of the reasons that LDO are so popular in the portable systems. Dropout voltage is 
also a function of the output current because in dropout region, the output transistor operates in the triode 
region and acts like a resistor. As a result, the dropout voltage is Iout ×Ron, where Ron is the resistance of the 
output transistor in dropout region. As a result, a low dropout voltage is necessary to maximize the 
efficiency. In commercial LDO regulators, the dropout voltages are often measured in different conditions 
but in similar ways.  
 
2.3.2 Quiescent Current 
  Quiescent current is defined as the difference between input and output current. Quiescent current 
 8 
quiescent current on battery life are most prevalent during low load-current conditions when current 
efficiency is low. For many applications, high load-current is usually a temporary condition, whereas the 
opposite is true for low load-currents. As a result, current efficiency plays a pivotal role in designing 
battery-powered supplies. The two performance specifications that predominantly limit the current 
efficiency of low drop-out regulators are maximum load-current and transient output voltage variation 
requirements. Typically, more quiescent current flow is necessary for improved performance in these areas 
[20]. 
 
2.3.4 Efficiency 
The efficiency is defined as the ratio between output power and input power as follows: 
 
100
( )
out out
out q in
I VEfficiency
I I V
= ×
+
             (2.3.4) 
 
Where Iout is the output current of the LDO, Iq is the quiescent current of the LDO, Vin is the input voltage of 
the regulators, Vout is the output voltage of the LDO [22]. To have a high efficiency LDO regulator, drop out 
voltage and quiescent current must be minimized. Therefore, low quiescent current, low dropout voltage, 
and low voltage difference between input and output are necessary.  
 
2.3.5 Load Regulation 
  Load regulation is a measure of LDO’s ability to maintain its output voltage to the pre-defined voltage 
under various loading conditions. The load regulation is defined 
as: 
e out
out

I

              (2.3.5) 
Figure 2.1 shows a typical PMOS linear regulator. The load regulation can be calculated and expressed as 
follows:

1
1e ( )fb fb
mp v fb
R R
Load R gulation
g A R
+
≈ ×      (2.3.6) 
 
Where Av is the gain of the error amplifier, gmp is the transconductance of the pass element, 1fbR  and 
2fbR  are feedback resistors. As noted from the above equation, load regulation can be improved by 
increasing dc open-loop gain Av or transconductance gmp of the pass element. Since load regulation is a 
steady-state parameter, all frequency components are neglected. The load regulation is limited by the open 
loop current gain of the system. As noted from the above equation, increasing dc open-loop current gain 
improves load regulation. 
 
2.3.6 Line Regulation 
  Line regulation is a measure of LDO’s ability to maintain its output voltage to the 
pre-defined voltage under various input voltages. The line regulation is defined as: 
 
e out

Fig. 2.7 Five common kinds of output pass element Structures 
 
  The last two pass element structures are NMOS and PMOS devices. The advantage of NMOS pass 
element is that it has little output resistance and variations of the output current affected the output voltage 
slightly. However, the drawback is dropout voltage should be larger than one gate-source voltage. The 
PMOS pass element is best one among five pass element structures. The advantage of PMOS is low 
quiescent current, low dropout voltage, and don’t have gate voltage limit compare with NMOS. The dropout 
voltage is determined by saturation voltage across the pass element, and the dropout voltage is proportional 
to the current flowing through the pass element, which is expressed as follows: 
                               ( )drop out onV I R= ×                     (2.3.13) 
 
where onR  is the on-resistance of pass element. Nowadays applications where high efficiency, low 
quiescent current, and low dropout voltage are popular, the PMOS LDO voltage regulator are extremely 
advanced and their performance is better than bipolar  
ones. Table 2.2 lists the comparison of these five pass element devices.

CHAPTER 3 
The LDO Architecture 
 
3.1 Architecture  
There are several commonly used architectures in linear regulators. However, as described in chapter 2, 
bipolar [23] and NMOS regulators [24] are not suitable in portable designs. Besides, some of them [25] [26] 
are not suitable due to their poor regulation performance. According to the types of the output pass element, 
several architectures in commonly found LDO are illustrated in Figure 3.1. One of the advantages of NMOS 
LDO is that since NMOS is connected as a source follower, its output impedance is low. The variations of 
load current will slightly change the positions of poles induced by output load. Therefore, the regulators of 
this architecture have a wide bandwidth and less stability concerns. On the other hand, however, its main 
drawback is its large dropout voltage. Some NMOS LDO [27]-[29] as shown in Figure 3.1(a) utilizes charge 
pump circuits to increase the gate drive voltage. In this manner, a low dropout voltage is achieved and it also 
takes advantage of the superior conductivity of NMOS [17][21]. However, the charge pump imposes stress 
and reliability problems on the LDO and the noise is also a concern.

of a differential amplifier; start up circuit, current mirror, and bandgap core circuit. A differential amplifier 
is composed of MP1, MP4, and MP5. A start-up circuit is composed of MS1, MS4, MS2, and MS3. A 
bandgap core circuit is composed of MP8, MP9, RN1, RN2, and RN3. The others current mirror is 
composed of MP6, MP7, MN5, MN6 of a group, and MP2, MP3, MN1, MN2, MN3, MN4 of a group. 
Second part of an error amplifier is composed of fist input stage and high output stage. The input stage is 
composed of MPE1, MPE2, MPE3, MNE1, and MNE2. The high output stage is composed of MPE4, MPE5, 
MNE3, and MNE4. The compensation is composed of MZ and C1. Third part of a pass element is MP. 
Fourth part of a feedback divider is composed of two resistances, Rfb2 and Rfb1.  
 
3.2 Bandgap Reference  
    Bandgap reference is widely used in analog and mixed-mode integrated circuits, such as data 
converters and DC-DC power converter. Bandgap reference generates a fixed voltage, Vref, to error amplifier 
which compares with the feedback network voltage and amplifies the voltage difference of two voltages. 
Bandgap is important in most integrated circuits because reference voltage generators exhibits low 
sensitivity to the process, supply, and temperature (PVT) variation. 
 
3.2.1 Conventional Bandgap Voltage Reference 
  The design of reference voltage is roughly divided into a three types. The first type of model is Zener 
diode. The circuit is extremely simple and can be drawn as Figure 3.3 [36]. It forms a quite steady output 
voltage. It does not receive the influence of the voltage change on the load current or the power, but the 
Zener diode must operate the breakdown region. The supply voltage should be in above 8V. When the 
operating voltage of the whole system is lower, it is unable to work normally. There is a lot of restriction of 
this circuit and consumes more power. The second type is the enhancement MOS. Although it can reach 
very steady voltage value, but it is limited to two kind of critical voltage. Therefore it is very sensitive to 
implement and often do not have correct output voltage. The third type of circuit is 
proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) circuit compensated by complementary to absolute 
temperature (CTAT) from PN-junction. It is shown figure 3.4. The PTAT and CTAT reference can be used to 
design a voltage reference which is not depended with temperature and voltage called a bandgap reference.

3.2.2 The Bandgap Reference Analysis 
  A bandgap voltage reference system is shown in Figure 3.4. [37] A voltage VBE is generated from a 
pn-junction diode having a temperature coefficient of approximately a -2mV/ °K temperature dependence 
around room temperature. It also generates a thermal voltage Vt(= KT q ), which is proportional to absolute

By taking the derivative of Eq. (3.2.10) at T0 with respect to temperature (assuming that Jc has a temperature

At 300K the change of VBE  with respect to temperature is approximately -2.2mV/ C
° . We have thus 
derived a suitable relationship for the VBE  term shown in Figure. 3.4. It is also necessary to develop the 
relationship for VBE∆  for two bipolar transistors having different current densities. Using the relationship 
given in Eq. (3.2.7), VBE∆  can be given as

Eqs.(3.2.11) and (3.2.13) must add up to zero. This is expressed mathematically as

  VEB1 has the positive temperature coefficient (TC). The EBV∆  between 1EBV  and 2EBV  has the negative 
TC.  Trimming the ratio of RN1 and RN2, bandgap voltage reference VREF with low sensitivity to the 
varying temperature and high PSRR is obtained. C0 plays a critical role of to ensure the stability of the 
feedback loop.  
 
  The complete circuit structure including a self-bias circuit and a start-up block is shown in Figure 3.7. 
MP1, MP6, MP7, MN6, MN5 form current mirrors to provide bias current source for the input stage of the 
amplifier. MN1, MN2, MN3, MN4 and MP2 also form a group of current mirrors to provide bias current for 
output transistor MP3. In fact, current source MP7 is provided by the output of the amplifier. It forms a 
self-feedback loop starting from MP3 drain output to bias current source MP1 flowing through current 
mirror MP7. The structure ensures the op amp has considerably stable bias current source as long as the 
output Vref keeps invariable.

  The start-up circuit is composed MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4. It provides start-up current for Q1 and op 
amp. MS4 is always ON no matter whether the amplifier or the other parts of the system works normally or 
not. When the circuit operates in zero-current state, the gate of MP8~MP10, same as that of MS1, are pulled 
high and close to supply VDD, The drain voltage of MS1 or MS4 is pulled low. It turns on MS2 and MS3 to 
inject current into bandgap core circuitry by MS3 and amplifier by MS2. Amplifier starts to operate and 
gradually pulls down its output voltage. Then it decreases gate voltage of M1 and increases drain voltage of 
MP8. The current injects to M1 and Q1, then to MS1. MS4 drain voltage is pulled high, and MS2 and MS3 
are cut-off. 
 
3.3 Error Amplifier 
  Two stage amplifier is the most commonly used configuration in CMOS. The first stage is the differential 
input with single-ended output. The second stage is either class A or class AB inverting output stage. Each 
stage typically is designed to have gain in the range of 40 to 100. Figure 3.8 shows the circuit configuration 
[33]. It’s composed of a high gain error amplifier, a high-gain high output-swing second output stage.

5.2Conventional Level Shifter Circuit 
  In dual supply voltage circuits, when connecting a ddLV -supplied circuit to a ddHV -supplied circuit, it is 
necessary to insert level converter at each low-to-high boundary as the interface to prevent the static current. 
Figure 5.3 show the schematic of a conventional level shifter where inputs low supply voltage ddLV  and the 
output high supply voltage ddHV  are used [34]. The two PMOS transistors MP1 and MP2 act as a 
cross-coupled load. Thick gate oxide transistor was used for MN1, MN2, MP1, and MP2 to overcome high 
voltage stress. Assuming that when the input signals (in) is at GND, MN1 turns ON and MN2 turns OFF. 
GND and node T2 goes to ddHV . No leakage current path exists between ddHV  and GND. Similarly, the 
operation reverses if input signal (in) switches to ddLV , the following procedure is take place. MN1 turns OFF 
and MN2 turns ON. MN1 pulls down T1 to ddHV  and T2 goes to GND. Finally the transition time from low 
voltage to high voltage is decided by the current driving capability of MP1. Pull down NMOS has to 
overcome the PMOS latch action before the output change state. Thererofer the size of MN1 and MN2 are 
much larger than MP1 and MP2.

Fig. 5.3 The conventional level shifter 
 
The convention level shifter has two disadvantages in actual implementation. First, because of the thick gate 
oxide transistor’s (MP1, MP2) high threshold voltage, it can not operate at the core voltage ddLV  under 1V. 
Second, current driving capability of MN1 and MN2 are decided by core voltage ddLV , but those of MP1 and 
 28 
as a level converter. It thus behaves as a “level converting NAND gate” as depicted by the signal waveforms. 
The level converting functionality of such embedded logic circuits can be built using any of the circuits.

Fig. 5.5 Concept of embedded logic level converting circuits 
 
  In Figure 5.6 an example of dynamic level shifter logic is shown. The dynamic level shifter circuit 
consists of a PMOSFET precharge transistor and an NMOSFET evaluation transistor with the clock signal 
(Clk ) applied to their gate nodes, and level shifter block to implement the NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR 
logic function. During the precharged phase ( Clk =0) the output node of the dynamic circuit is charged 
through the presharged PMOSFET transistor to the supply voltage level. The output of the static buffer is 
discharged to ground. During the evaluation phase (Clk =1) the evaluation NMOSFET transistor is ON, and 
depending on the logic performed by the level shifter block, the output of the dynamic circuit is either 
discharged or it will stay precharged. One major advantage of the dynamic, precharged design styles over 
the static styles is that eliminate of the spurious transitions and the corresponding power dissipation.

5.5 Other Level Shifter Structure  
 A dc to dc level converter, which speed reducing and power consumption will have great influence on 
dual-vdd design. In the dc to dc level converter structure, we often use feedback circuit to pull up output to 
VDDH full swing. Because of structure of feedback circuit resulting in Different Cascode Voltage Switched 
Level Converter (DCVSLC) and Pass-Gate based Level Converter (PGLC). Figure 5.7 shows that the two 
circuits have operating low speed and great power consuming. Therefore, in the reference [35] it adopts 
dual-VTH cell to improve this two drawbacks. Take DCVSLC for example, an input (IN) and its inverter of 
operating at VDDL producing signal to control M1 and M2. When operating at low voltage the delay time 
will affect it performance. Due to this reason, therefore we can adopt the Low-VTH Cell to keep better 
speeding. Both M1and M2 are pull down circuits, which controlled by VDDL full swing signal. Contrary to 
M1 and M2, M3 and M4 all pull-up circuit, which controlled by VDDH full swing signal. To balance this

5.7 Combination of Level Converter 
Figure 5.9 (a)(b)(c)(d) used improved dc to dc level converter, and proposed a composed of NAND, NOR, 
XOR,XNOR and dc to dc level converter. The advantage of proposed level converter logic is saving power 
consumption and delay time. In the chapter 6 I will compare conventional logic with level converter and my 
proposed structure.

CHAPTER 6 
Simulations for Level Converter 
  In the simulation, I will adopt level converter and combination logic to compare with my proposed 
structure. I will compare both delay time and power in following. Table 6.1 Table 6.1 summarizes the 
performance benefits of all LC. Figure 6.1 (a)~(i) shows that, is block of circuit. Figure 6.2 (a)~(d) shows 
that, simulation for LCNAND, LCNOR, LCXOR and LCXNOR. Table 6.2 (a)~(d) is outcome after 
comparing.

In this table, LCNAND Post-Simulation increase delay time and power consumption. Due to it have 
parasitic capacitance between Metal and Metal. The parasitic capacitance will affect the rise time and fall 
time. When the delay time change, power consumption will also change.

LCNOR also like LCNAND, the parasitic capacitance will affect delay time and power consumption. We 
can see the delay time and power consumption between Pre-Simulation and Post-Simulation in two tables 
 46 
also does not have any element connect to ground. So the delay time in Pre-Simulation will increase more 
than Post-Simulation. But Power consumption not change very much.
