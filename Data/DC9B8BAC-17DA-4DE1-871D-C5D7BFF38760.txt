 2
bonds or weaker bonds, between gate dielectric 
(SiO2) and pentacene active layers are also key 
issues affecting the performance of OTFTs [4, 5]. 
Therefore, several schemes have been devised to 
reduce the trap state for pentacene-based OTFTs 
[4, 5]. Here we present a new technique for 
treating the OTFT gate dielectric with 
N2O-plasma. This method is a low temperature 
process that can produce a smooth gate dielectric 
surface and simultaneously reduce the interface 
trap state, resulting in significant improvement 
in device performance. To our knowledge, this is 
the first time N2O-plasma has been applied in 
treating the gate dielectric and improving OTFT 
performance. 
 
III. EXPERIMENT 
The pentacene-based OTFTs used a bottom 
contact (BC) structure, fabricated onto a heavy 
doped n-type silicon substrate to act as the gate 
electrodes. The gate dielectric, 100 nm-thick 
SiO2 is grown using high density plasma 
chemical vapour deposition (HDP-CVD) at 375 
˚C. The metal Pt/Cr (70 nm/2 nm) is evaporated 
using an electron-beam evaporation system as 
the source/drain (S/D) electrodes, which are 
patterned using the lift-off method onto the gate 
dielectric before N2O-plasma treatment. For the 
structure using N2O-plasma treatment, the device 
is subjected to pure N2O-plasma at 200 mTorr 
for 10 min in a HDP-CVD chamber with 
non-heated substrate. The device channel length 
and width are 4 μm and 500 μm, respectively. 
We deposited the organic films in the non-heated 
substrate by thermal evaporation using pure 
pentacene powders. The pentacene film 
thickness was about 700 A˚ and the deposition 
rate was fixed at ~0.3 A˚/s.

IV. RESULTS and DISCUSSION 
Fig. 1 illustrates the AFM images of the gate 
dielectric (SiO2) surface without and with 
N2O-plasma treatment, where the 
root-mean-square values of surface roughness 
(Rrms) were determined to be 0.916 and 0.678 
nm, respectively. It had been reported that a 
significant decrease in gate dielectric (SiO2) 
surface roughness after oxygen plasma treatment 
was observed as a result of the oxygen cleaning 
effect [6]. Fritz et al. reported that upon gate 
dielectric smoothing prior to pentacene 
 4
extracted using the method of Levinson et al. [7] 
and Proano et al. [8]. Using the N2O-plasma 
treatment, the trap state density was reduced 
from 1.61 × 1013 to 1.1 × 1013 cm–2. This 
decreased trap state density is believed to be due 
to nitrogen radicals dissociated from the 
N2O-plasma and introduced into the gate 
dielectric (SiO2) surface. This phenomenon 
results in the formation of strong Si-N bonds that 
replace the dangling bonds or weaker bonds of 
the gate dielectric surface and reduce interface 
traps. The increased strong Si-N bonds will 
result in OTFT performance improvement, 
especially in the on/off current ratio and 
field-effect mobility [2]. Thus, the fabricated 
pentacene-based OTFTs with N2O-plasma 
treated gate dielectric show better performance 
than those without gate dielectric treatment, 
including higher field-effect mobility and higher 
saturation current. 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
We investigated the N2O-plasma effect on the 
gate dielectric (SiO2) properties of OTFTs based 
on pentacene. The N2O-plasma treatment 
successfully reduced gate dielectric (SiO2) 
roughness and simultaneously improved 
pentacene crystallisation. The pentacene-based 
OTFTs with N2O-plasma treatment can improve 
the on current almost two times, increase the μFE 
greater than 50%, and reduce the interface traps 
to 31%, compared to devices without plasma 
treatment. Therefore, we believe that 
N2O-plasma treatment is a good candidate 
method to improve OTFT performance.
