Abstract 
Ponding test is one of methods to evaluate the durability of concrete materials, but 
it takes more than two months in this procedure, in order to economize the time used 
in the test process, the Accelerated chloride migration test had developed, the final 
penetration depth could be found after curve fitting.  
In this project, preparing three kinds of mortars with different mineral admixtures 
(fly ash, slag and fly ash plus slag), and the mortars also designed four kinds of 
water-to-cementitious materials ratio (w/c=0.35, 0.45, 0.55, and 0.65), twelve 
admixtures in total, after processed four kinds of migration time of ACMT, and three 
kinds of ponding time, gauge the diffusion coefficient and the penetration depth of 
chloride ions in each specimen, and then discuss the relation between the migration 
time and Ponding time in ACMT and Ponding test, respectively.

Introduction 
1.1  Background 
Since the concrete created in the world, it always is the major material in 
civil structures, including houses, high buildings, roads, bridges, harbors, and 
tunnels, all constructions apply huge among of concrete, which is a composite 
material made by cement, water, aggregate, mineral admixtures, and chemical 
materials. 
When apply a widely used material like concrete in build should consider 
many environment and structure problems, such as the selection and arrangement 
of reinforce material, mechanical design of structure, resistance ability with 
earthquake, and resistance ability against chloride penetration. 
Reinforced concrete structure is constructed by steel and concrete, and the 
steel should be wrapped in a thickness of concrete according to different standard, 
then the chloride ions will not easily penetrate into the structure and result in the 
corrosion reaction with steel. The oxide compound generated in the corrosion 
reaction will expand the volume of steel, and then the cracks will be found in or 
on the structure. Especially under the extremity circumstances, like the marine 
environment, there has higher chloride concentration in the air than other place, 
that makes the chloride diffuse faster, decrease the service life a lot, and the 
cracks show up very early, the cost needed to rehabilitate deteriorated concrete 
structure is tremendous [1]. 
In October 1999, the “International conference on ion and mass transport in 
cement-based materials”, Cickley[2] indicated that the following questions should be 
able to answer: 
8
investigate the relationship between this two test. 
 
1.2  Objective of research 
The objective of this study is analysis the time relationship between the ponding 
time in the ponding test and migration time in ACMT by testing the non-steady state 
diffusion result for the mortars contenting three kinds of mineral admixture (fly ash, 
slag and fly ash plus slag) and four different water-to-cementitious materials ratio 
(w/c=0.35, 0.45, 0.55, and 0.65), there are twelve admixtures totally.  
The experimental results can be charted as exponential form equation, and 
compare the penetration depth in ACMT and ponding test, there will come out a time 
relationship between two tests procedures, the detail are expressed in sector 4.4.

 2.2 Theory of chloride ion diffusion in concrete 
The principal of transportation is Fick’s First Law (2-1) which is the description 
of steady diffusion: 
x
CDJ eff 
                        (2-1) 
Where  J   is the flux across a unit area of ion species,  effD   is the effective diffusion 
coefficient, C   is the concentration of ion species and x  is the ion position. 
But most of diffusion happened are non-steady state, namely, the flux and 
gradient at each point is changed with time, result in the ion species were amassed or 
exhausted. The Fick’s Second Law (2-2) was modified as: 
2

                 (2-2) 
In which includes the effect of changing concentration with time (t). This equation is 
usually soled applying the following condition: boundary condition is 0)0,0( CC tx   
(surface concentration is constant at 0C ), initial condition is 0)0,0(  txC  (initial 
concentration in the concrete is 0), infinite condition is 0)0,(  txC  (infinite far 
away from the surface, the concentration will always be 0), result in the following 
equation (2-3):

porous matrix that including both solid and liquid. Compare with the ion diffusion in 
pore structure, the diffusion rate in solid matrix is negligible; therefore, the effective

 Fig. 2.1 Ion migration under electrical field 
Not only chloride ions move in the test procedure, but also the chemical 
compounds in concrete or electrolyte solution take part in migration. According to the 
definition of the transference number ( jt ), which means a specific ion moving 
characteristic under an external electrical field, jt  is defined by the proportion of 
current carried by the specific ion and total current in migration test, it is described

Experimental Program 
In order to compare the time relationship between the two kinds of test procedure 
in non-steady state and find the durability variation come from composite difference, 
the specimen designed as three groups, each contented different minerals (fly ash, slag 
and fly ash plus slag) and four water-to-cementitous materials ratio (0.35, 0.45, 0.55 
and 0.65) for each group. The accelerated chloride migration test with applied 
electrical field across the specimen was used to find the chloride penetrate through the 
5 cm specimen, and set the migration time which are 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 times of 
penetration time. Meanwhile, the ponding time are set as 60, 90, 120 and 180 days, 
and chart the profile of chloride penetrated in each specimen for the two test 
procedures.

3.2 Specimen preparation and vacuum saturated 
The mortar specimens were cast as cylinders, 100 mm diameter and 200 mm in 
heights for twelve mixtures, after casting, specimens were covered with burlap sheets 
and left in the casting room at a temperature about 23±1℃. Demoulded after 24 hours 
and put into water curing room for over 91 days. 
After curing, the specimens were cut into two kinds of size for two test 
procedure, the diagram of specimen size are listed in Fig.3.1; one is 100 mm diameter 
and 50 mm thickness for accelerate chloride migration test, and another one is 100 
mm diameter and 100 mm height, used for ponding test. Then following the 
specification of ASTM C1202-97[4], the sliced specimen was vacuum water 
saturated.

3.3 Test procedure of ACMT 
The Accelerated Chloride Migration Test (ACMT) is a modified version of the 
RCPT (Rapid Chloride Permeability Test), according to ASTM C 1202-97[4] and 
AASHTO T277-93[16], this test including four steps: 
1) Specimens’ preparation and setting up the test apparatus. 
2) Monitoring the amount of electrical current. 
3) Measuring the chloride content in anode cell. 
4) Measuring the quantity of chloride ions passing through the specimen in 
different depth. 
The schematic of the ACMT apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. The 50 mm thick 
sliced specimen was placed between two acrylic cells in ACMT. The anodic cell was 
filled with 4.5 liter of 0.3 mole/L NaOH solution and the cathode cell was filled with 
4.5 liter of 0.52 mole/L (3wt %) NaCl solution. Two mesh electrodes (10 cm diameter, 
#20 mesh brass screen) was placed on two side of the specimen and near the surface 
of it that the electrical field is applied primarily across the test specimen. Connect the 
power source with the mesh electrodes, and keep the electric field on 24V during the 
test procedure. The electrical current was measured and recorded 5 minute once in the 
data logger, the exact apparatus of ACMT was listed in Fig. 3.4.

3.3.1 Define migration time 
When chloride ion penetrate through 5 cm specimen, chloride ion can be 
measured in the cathode cell, and this study define the concentration in cathode cell 
reach to 0.00052 mol/L (C/C0=0.1 %, C is the concentration in cathode cell, C0 is the 
initial chloride concentration in anode cell), named break through time (the time-span 
for chloride ion penetration through specimen), the test result of break through time 
are listed in sector 4.1.1. 
After define each Break through time for different admixture, multiplied the 
value by 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 as the migration time in ACMT, Table 3.7 shows all 
migration time for different admixture.

3.5 Analysis of chloride content 
After ACMT and ponding test procedure finish, there has the collection of 
powder sample has two different ways; one is core cutting and makes the core into 4 
mm thick of sliced piece, just like Fig. 3.8, then crush the sliced piece into powder. 
26
The chloride content in each layer was analyzed according to the specification in 
AASHTO T260-97[17]. Weight 3g powder as sample in each layer, add in 10 ml of 
boiling water and 1 ml. of HNO3, stirring the solution for 1 minute, then add in 
boiling water to 60 ml and stirring for 5 minute. Make the hot liquid sample pass 
through the filter which made by two layer of filter paper (Whatman No. 41 and 
No.40), and keep washing the hot sample’s beaker till all powder sample was washed 
off (Fig. 3.8), finally, the filtered liquid sample were about 125 to 150 ml. Then the 
filtered liquid sample was send titration system which use 0.01N silver nitrate 
(AgNO3) solution titrate the sample, the titration system was listed in Fig. 3.5.

4.4 Relationship between migration time in ACMT and Ponding time in Ponding 
test 
In each penetration depth vs. concentration figure, when the concentration reach 
to 0.01, define the corresponding depth as final penetration depth Xa (in ACMT) and 
Xp (in ponding test), see Fig. 4.14 in page  and Fig. 4.26 in page , Xa of MS35-A05 
is 0.388 cm, and Xp of MS35-P60 is 0.551 cm, then put the values as a ratio (Xa/Xp), 
comes out a ratio 0.705, which means the penetration depth difference, when the ratio 
become 1, means there are same penetration depth in different test, the chloride 
penetration depth ratio are listed in Table 4.4 and 4.5.

Suggestions 
1. The non-steady test result of ACMT cooperate with the conclusion of this 
study could be a new method to assess the durability of cementitious 
materials. 
2. This study only investigate the time relation of mortar specimens, there still  
many kinds of admixtures like concrete and concrete with mineral content 
specimens, if there’s more testing result to join the time relation, that will 
make the theory more perfect.

 research is limited, literature reviewed by 
Karthigeyan et al. (2006) found that aspect of 
influence of vertical load on lateral response of piles 
based on analytical investigations (Davisson and 
Robinson 1965; and Goryunov 1975) reveals that for 
a given lateral load, the presence of vertical load 
increases the lateral deflection. However, laboratory 
(Anagnostopous and Georgiadis 1993 and Jain et al. 
1987) and in-situ investigations (Bartolomey 1977 
and McNulty 1956) suggest a decrease in lateral 
deflection under the presence of vertical loads. 
 
Studies by Anagnostopoulos and Georgiadis 
(1993) show that the conventional subgrade reaction 
and elastic half space methods of analysis do not 
take into account the modified status of soil stresses 
and local plastic volume changes in the soil 
continuum under combined loading. 
 
Numerical studies by Ying et al. (2009) 
concluded that presence of vertical loads decreases 
the lateral displacements and bending moments of 
the super-long pile. In soft clay, the action of lateral 
loads increases the vertical bearing capacity of 
super-long pile. 
 
Zhao (1987) reported that pile performance 
subjected to combined loading is depended on the 
ratio of the applied lateral and axial loading. When 
the magnitude of the applied vertical loading is 
higher than lateral loading, the failure modes tend to 
be controlled by the axial type failures, such as pile 
tip shear failure, punching shear failure or buckling. 
On the contrary, if the applied axial force is smaller 
than the lateral force, flexural failure for long piles 
and overturning or horizontal movement failure for 
short piles occur. 
 
Based on these above reviewed researches, in 
summary, pile performance due to combined 
axial/lateral loading is mainly influenced by the 
following factors: 1) soil type and soil parameters, 
such as internal friction angle, dilation angle, shear 
strength, and soil modulus; 2) loading sequences, 
such as simultaneously applied axial/ lateral 
loadings or one loading applied ahead of the other 
loading and applied loading ratio; 3) pile head 
boundary condition, pile stiffness and slenderness 
ratio; 4) characteristics of pile bearing capacity, such 
as end bearing or frictional resistance or both. 
 
In this paper, a series of full scale drilled shaft 
load test results subjected to combined loading and 
lateral loading only are presented and compared to 
the results conducted using the computer software, 
LPILE and the method proposed by Lin et al. (2010); 
Lin and Liao (2006); and Lin et al. (2005). 
2. SOIL CONDITIONS 
The pile load testing site is located in Chien-Jen 
district of Kaohsuing city, Taiwan. The subsurface 
conditions at the testing site can be divided into 
eight layers, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the 
top 5 meters of backfill material, typical soil 
condition at the site from ground surface is roughly 
consisted of 35 meters of sandy silt overlying low 
plasticity clay ground. The soil layer condition and 
the physical soil properties of each layer for the two 
boreholes, BH-3 and BH-4, close to the test shafts 
are shown in Fig. 2, with the testing shafts sitting on 
the sixth layer consisting of hard silty soil. Ground 
water level is in general about 1.31 m to 1.60 m 
below ground surface, and is 1.5 m during testing. 
Simplified soil properties of each layer are listed in 
Table , in which the phi value (drained) is peak 
value. 
3. DRILLED SHAFTS CONSTRUCTION AND 
TESTING SETUP 
The tested shafts, TP-1 and TP-2, and the anchor 
shafts were all installed via reversed circulation 
method. All shafts are 1.4 m in diameter and 36.97 
m in length. Excavation was conducted via tri-blade 
auger. Drilling was also done with a polymer slurry 
pumped into a shaft borehole, whose verticality has 
to meet the requirement of 1/200. The tremie method 
was used for shaft concreting, using a slump 
between 18 and 22 cm. The design 28-day 
unconfined compressive strength of the concrete is 
27.5 MPa. Numbers and sizes of reinforcement are 
shown in Fig. 3. The yield strengths of 
reinforcement with diameter larger than 19 mm or 
with diameter smaller than 16 mm are 412 MPa and 
27.5 MPa, respectively. Four PVC pipes were 
attached to the rebar cages of each shaft for sonic 
logging integrity testing. Good concrete quality was 
found for both TP-1 and TP-2 after integrity testing. 
 
To evaluate the total load carried at different 
depths along the shafts, both rebar stress meters and 
telltale were installed at several selected depths of 
each shaft and were protected. Rebar stress meters 
were installed at thirteen pre-selected depths as 
shown in Fig. 4. Denser rebar meters were provided 
at the top 5 meters below pile head. For economical 
reason, only two rebar meters were used at each

Figure 2 Soil properties at the location of the test 
36.7 m, two telltales were installed at each level. 
These depths were selected for measuring the shaft 
displacement at foundation excavation depth and at 
pile toe.  
 
Sketches and photos of experimental load test 
setup are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The space between 
the test shaft and the anchor shaft is 7.03 m, which is 
five times wider than the pile diameter. Other related 
shaft information is given in Table 2. Different types 
of loading combination and applied load level at 
each stage are given in Table 3.  
4. TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The lateral displacements at pile head of TP-1 
and TP-2 under different combined loading levels 
are shown in Fig. 7(a) and 7(b), respectively. For 
TP-1 pile, the pile head displacement is 11.59 mm 
under a combination of 4905 kN lateral loading and 
883 kN axial loading. However, the lateral 
displacement of TP-1 reaches 16.09 mm under a 
smaller lateral loading of 834 kN. For cyclic lateral 
loading, the maximum displacement of 17.1 mm 
occur under the maximum applied load of 773 kN. 
Similar trend for TP-2 is observed as shown in Fig. 
7(b) for comparison. Applying axial load ahead of 
lateral load reduces the magnitude of the lateral 
displacement at head. Based on the normalized 
lateral load versus displacement relationship, as 
shown in Fig. 8, only 63% of the pile head 
displacement occurs at lateral load application as a 
result of combined loading. 67% was observed by 
similar study using numerical analysis (Zheng and 
Li 2008). 
 
Using the installed stress meter, measured stress 
distributions along depth of TP-1 and TP-2 are given 
in Fig. 9. Both tensile stress and compressive stress, 
from axial loading, lateral loading and combined 
loading, on either tension or compression side are 
shown for comparison. For the TP-1, the measured 
stress is due to the applied separate axial loading of 
4905 kN and lateral loading of 834 kN, or combined 
effect. Again, for TP-2, the measured stress is due to 
the applied separate axial loading of 4905 kN and 
lateral loading of 491 kN, or combined effect. High 
tensile stresses, under lateral loading only, occur at 
depth of 4 to 5 m below shaft head. When the axial 
loading is applied ahead of lateral loading, the axial 
compressive stress resulted from axial loading tends 
to reduce the magnitude of tensile stress. As 
observed for T-12 and T22 cases on the R-side in 
Fig. 9, the tensile stresses are significantly reduced 
when axial load exists. 
The curvatures of TP-1 and TP-2 shafts along 
depth are given in Fig. 10. The curvatures are 
calculated based on the measurement results, by the 
following equations

 The calculated bending moments of T11, T12, 
T21, and T22 cases along shaft depth are shown in 
Fig. 11. In the figure, the notation “C” and “L” 
indicate the results of the Cesaro sum technique and 
the LPILE, respectively. The location of predicted 
bending moments matches the measured steel stress 
location as given in Figs. 9 and 10. In general, the 
Cesaro sum technique outperforms LPILE. Although 
the p-delta effects in the analysis is considered by 
the computer code, LPILE, neglected frictional 
resistance due to axial loading effect may be the 
reason to the deviation between numerical results.
