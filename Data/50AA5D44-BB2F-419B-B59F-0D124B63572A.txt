2. 英文摘要 
This project designed and implemented a device called wireless access agents (WAAs), which can 
support users to access various heterogeneous networks at any places. WAA uses mobile aware services to 
accurately detect user’s mobility status. Through MIH Information Services (MIH IS), mobile stations can 
acquire current network status. By integrating with users’ profile and network status, we formulated network 
access as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making problem so that WAA can choose a network better meet users’ 
preference. Moreover, we presented a new paradigm called Always Best Network Connect (ABCN) which 
allows WAA to choose an access network based on the best advantages of both end users, which is quite 
different from existing ABC (Always Best Connected) services. Finally, we presented a cross transport and 
MAC layer scheme to determine the timing of vertical handoff so that we can achieve good throughput for 
mobile users. Experiments show that our scheme based on motion awareness and TCP CWND performs better 
than existing schemes.

3.1. 研究目的 
隨著網路科技的發展，各種不同的行動網路接取技術可提供的頻寬持續提升，無線接取網路技術
服務範圍互相涵蓋，構成了一個異質性整合的無所不在網路服務環境[1][2]。在此環境中，雖然多模
式(multi-mode)的行動終端(Mobile Node；MN)可以存取異質性網路並享受快速的網路服務，但是建置
多模網路卡並非一個良好的決策方向，原因是 1) 它容易過時 2)它缺乏普遍性 3)它產生耗電問題。因
此，如何讓行動終端使用簡單的網路存取技術，但卻能享受日新月異的無線網路服務，這才是未來網
路服務發展的模式。 
現今市場上各電信公司雖提供各種隨插即用的無線網路設備[3][4]，但是這些產品皆只針對某一

最後為了測試開發的演算法與系統效果，本計畫建制一個實驗網路，並以網路語音服務及多媒體

4. 研究方法 
本年度計畫完成多模行動終端的多媒體通訊系統並設計數種演算法，以提升在多模通訊下多路徑
平行傳輸系統的效能，包括(A)WAA系統架構設計 (B) MIH為基礎的封包遺失輔助(Packet loss aware)
移動偵測。 
 
4.1. WAA系統設計- WAA架構 
在第一年中，我們已完成行動終端與 WAA 的連線流程與換手設計。行動終端不管是單模或是多模
都可透過 WAA連接網路，享受多模系統的通訊傳輸。WAA本身提供 MIH-IS agent 與 MIH-IS server的
功能。WAA的 IS agent可以透過在後端的 IS server來選擇最佳的存取網路或做傳輸的負載平衡。同
樣，當行動終端要存取 WAA的通訊服務，它利用其內建之 IS agent來與 WAA的 IS server取得連線與
負載的資訊。在此設計中，我們最為創新之處在於如何支援各種換手模式如: WAA 換手、行動終端換
手、還有水平換手、垂直換手。其中，水平換手又分為進入換手(Handover In)以及出去換手(Handover 
out)。在傳統 NAT的架構中，NAT沒有換手的問題，然而，WAA卻可能常常換手。以下我們會介紹 WAA
的基本架構 與基本流程和換手部分的流程設計。  
行動終端利用來作跨層通訊的溝通以及與遠端系統的溝通，圖 4 這些 MIH 標準的服務機制使層跟
層之間可以更快速的得到資訊[11]-[13]。這些資訊可分為兩部份，一為下層的資訊， 例如無線頻道
與 MAC 資訊。另一項則為上層資訊，例如應用層的 QoS參數。最後再利用這些資訊協助行動裝置與 WAA

在系統設計上，我們允許 MN 也能夠分享自身存取技術作為 WAA(ex: Host AP 型式)，讓只有單一
存取介面的裝置也得以藉由此分享裝置連上各種存取網路。圖 6為在 MMM模組中的使用者模式(MN_Mode)
狀態圖，它能表示每個行動終端從初始狀態到使用不同存取技術時的狀態，以及觸發狀態切換的事件
(Event)。

接著，圖 7表示 MMM為分享模式(Share mode)時的存取模式轉換狀態圖。此模式能提供 MN的網路
資源給連接的使用者，扮演傳統中 Host AP相同的功能，而且在分享模式中，使用者還能藉由 WAA本
身多接取網路連線的好處，使連結 WAA 的使用者得以運用多個存取技術連線的能力，來達到在異質性
網路中多路徑平行傳輸的服務。

 Handoff In : 圖 8 中(a)當 MN 從原本基地台 AP1 換手到 WAA 時。MN 可能遠離了原本的基
地台 AP1 又或是接近了 WAA，通常 MN 會視 WAA 為一個 AP，所以 MN 會藉由 WAA 發送
的服務公告找到 WAA 裝置而連上它，這情形可能是由公有網路 AP 換到 WAA 的私有網路，
最後藉由 WAA 來幫助連上網路的狀況。 
 
 Handoff out : 從原本連接到 WAA 的連線換手到其他基地台的狀況。此換手服務圖 8 中(b)表
示前端服務 MN 使用者遠離了 WAA 時或是 WAA 遠離 MN 使用者時，這時因為 WAA 會探測
到 MN 漸漸遠離裝置，所以必須提早幫它做連線的轉移動作，從私有網路 WAA 轉移到公有
網路 Wi-Fi AP1 基地台，使 MN 的連線能夠持續不斷。 
 
 Horizontal Handoff : 在 WAA 連線中從原本所連線的基地台切換到其他同屬性的基地台。如
圖 8 中(c)表示 MN 藉由 WAA 連上基地台 AP2，而因為基地台的訊號衰弱或無法連上，這時
WAA 就會使用 Horizontal Handoff 服務去自動搜尋同性質的網路而連上其他較好的基地台，
使 MN 的連線能夠保持不中斷。 
 
 Vertical Handoff : 如圖 8 中(d)所示 WAA 從 Wi-Fi 基地台 AP2 換手到 UMTS 基地台 AP1。
這種類型的服務，會因為 WAA 原本連線的網路型態的基地台訊號衰弱，但同質性的網路基
地台卻又找不到時(如:在山區地廣人稀 Wi-Fi 基地台無法密集佈建，可能 Wi-Fi 的存取技術就
無法使用)，這時就會使用 WAA 的 Vertical Handoff 服務技術切換到不同的網路存取基地台，
幫助 MN 的連線能夠維持不中斷。 
 
4.2.2. 換手過程 
最後我們以圖 9 的 Flow 圖來說明 WAA 的換手過程。WAA 的模組之間使用 MIH Service 進行溝通。
首先使用者執行初始化動作，如設定臨界值(threshold)、優先連線設定(ex: ABC 參數)、執行模式….
等等的基本使用者偏好設定，接著，行動管理模組就能藉由此設定來幫助使用者作挑選與連線的動作，
進而將這些相關資訊也一併傳送到網路挑選摸組，再由此模組來進行最佳網路存取點的挑選。當挑選
好存取點後則會直接進行連線動作，並且判定是否有 MIP的機制，若無以普通 IP連線方式做為連線；
若有，則驅動移動 IP 控制(Mobile ip Control; MC)的 Mobile IP。MD 持續的監測各連線的服務，若
連線發生訊號品質微弱或中斷則會立即觸發通知，將訊息告知移動管理模組進行進一步的換手切換或
是保持原連線的動作。

4.3. 以 MIH 為基礎的封包遺失輔助(Packet loss aware)移動偵測與最佳無縫換手設計 
延續本團隊以前的研究成果-行動感知的網路感測 NDMD (Network Discovery based on Motion 
Detection (NDMD))[16]，本計畫提出一個封包遺失感知的跨層換手機制，稱為 PLA-NDMD(Packet Loss 
Aware NDMD)，來改善 WAA 換手效能。現有的換手機置大多藉由網路模擬的方式來探討其效能，因
此，RSS 的大小常常被當作是傳輸品質的唯一考慮。然而，透過實測，我們發現，RSS 代表了連線的
訊號強度，但是卻不能代表訊號的品質，不但如此，對不同的傳輸標準如 WiFi 與 UMTS，它們的訊號
強度 RSS 與傳輸品質的關係也不同。對 WiFi，訊號因環境產生很大的變化，RSS 有時雖然很大，但是
傳輸品質卻很差，單單利用 NDMD 來做換手決策是不夠了；對 UMTS 而言，其 RSS 與傳輸品質的關
係較穩定，因此，我們依據不同的網路特質來設計 PLA-NDMD。 
與其統計確切的封包遺失率，我們創新的利用 TCP 的特性，以 CWND(Congestion Window)相對於
封包遺失的變化，當作封包遺失的跡象，來量測傳輸品質。基於此，我們定義一品質指標如下:

throughput of NDMD. 
II. RELATED WORK 
This section reviews various network discovery mechanisms. 
In general, network discovery approaches are divided into three 
categories: reactive, proactive and location-aware method. 
 
A. Proactive and Reactive Method  
In the proactive mechanism [5], an MT turns on all its NIC 
(Network Interface Controller) to do network discovery in 
advance and monitors all available networks continually. If an 
MT finds a better network, it uses a particular policy or rule to 
determine whether to execute a handoff. Accordingly, the MT 
can reduce the handoff latency at the expense of large power 
consumption. In the reactive mechanism, an MT applies a 
certain threshold such as the RSS [11] or the frame error rate 
(FER) to determine whether it needs to seek other available 
networks.  
 
B.  Location-aware Method 
Based on the location information, an MT can activate or 
terminate the WLAN interface at an appropriate time to save 
battery power. However, the handoff is also based on a reactive 
method. In location-aware schemes [6–10], one first locates a 
MT’s position and calculates the distance between a transmitter 
and an MT. Then, the MT uses different time interval to do the 
network discovery based on the distance. If the distance to the 
transmitter is long, the MT will wait for a long time interval to 
do network discovery. However, the location aware network 
discovery scheme requires extra hardware and can not work in 
an indoor environment where no positioning system can work. 
C. NDMD Algorithm 
The NDMD [11] algorithm obtains an MT’s moving 
information in a wireless environment without any assistance of 
a positing system and uses a set of rules to make handoff 
decision. NDMD calculates two smoothed received signal 
strength (SRSS). One is an agile SRSS and the other is a stable 
SRSS. Let α and β are the smoothing factors for calculating the 
agile SRSS and the stable SRSS respectively. R[i] is the 
received signal strength measured by an MT. Then the agile 
SRSS A[i] and stable SRSS S[i] are given by 
Agile SRSS： ][]1[)1(][ iRiAiA    (2-1) 
Stable SRSS： ][]1[)1(][ iRiSiS                                                                    
in which, β is smaller than α and usually,

k

  ,  k>1                                  (2-2)       
where k is a constant. Based on Eq. (2-1), the trend indicator 
DIF is defined as the difference between the agile SRSS and the 
stable SRSS as follows: 
][][][ iSiAiDIF                                                (2-3) 
DIF is then used to determine at which motion state an MT is. 
 The NDMD algorithm, as illustrated in Fig. 2, detects MT’s 
behavior by two thresholds (DIFthresh), based on which one of 
three network discovery modes are defined as follows:  
1. NON_ND mode: An MT is in an “approaching mode”, i.e., 
the MT is approaching the WLAN AP. Thus, the network 
discovery is unneeded.  
2. ND mode: An MT is in a “leaving mode”, i.e., the MT is 
leaving from its associated AP. Thus, it is critical for an MT 
to activate all its interfaces to detect available wireless 
networks such as 3G and WiMAX.  
3. SEMI_ND mode: In this mode, an MT is stationary. An MT 
first determines whether or not other usable WLAN AP exists. 
If other AP exists, the MT determines whether a horizontal 
handoff is needed. Otherwise, the MT needs to activate all its 
interfaces to do network discovery.

III. PACKET LOSS AWARE NDMD ALGORITHM 
  The Packet Loss Aware NDMD (PLA-NDMD) exploits 
packet loss information in the transport layer and the RSS 
samples from the physical layer to assist the data link layer in 
making handover decision. PLA-NDMD is an application of a 
cross-layer design in optimizing performance of wireless 
networking. Figure 3 shows the architecture of PLA-NDMD in 
the protocol stack, in which the Media Independent Handover

Figure 4   Flow chart of switching from UMTS to WIFI 
Figure 4 shows that when an MT connects to the UMTS, it 
needs to measure RSS and calculate the DIF. Because the large 
signal coverage of UMTS, the RSS of UMTS is steady and the 
DIF value is stable. Once the UMTS RSS is smaller than the 
WIFI RSS as well as the UMTS DIF is below DIFthresh, the MT 
will switch to the network discovery mode to activate the 
applicable interfaces based on the NDMD algorithm. 
Figure 5 shows the flow chart when an MT stays at the WIFI 
mode. Usually, the Receive Signal Strength (RSS) of WIFI 
varies drastically when an MT moves. Thus, instead of using 
RSS, we use the QI value to determine the transmission quality 
and handoff timing when CWND samples are available. When 
QI reaches 100% indicating poor transmission quality, the MT 
will start doing network discovery and preparing for handoff 
execution. On the other hand, if no CWND sample is available 
due to the lack of TCP connection, the traditional NDMD is 
applied.

IV. EXPERIMENT RESULT ANALYSIS 
In this section, we define the smoothing factor α in our 
algorithm and analyze how QI value helps to verify the NDMD 
algorithm. In section 4.1, we introduce the experimental 
configuration. In section 4.2, we show our experiment and 
algorithm performance. 
In the experiments we compare the performance of NDMD 
(UMTS RSS=-84dBm), NDMD (UMTS RSS<WIFI RSS), 
RSS threshold-based scheme and PLA-NDMD. NDMD 
(UMTS RSS=-84dBm) and NDMD (UMTS RSS < WIFI RSS) 
are two versions of NDMD algorithm. NDMD (UMTS 
RSS=-84dBm) is based on a fixed RSS thresh value, in which an 
MT switches to the WIFI mode whenever the RSS of UMTS is 
below a given threshold, -84dBm; NDMD (UMTS RSS < WIFI 
RSS) is based on relative RSS values, in which an MT switches 
from the UMTS mode to the WIFI mode whenever the RSS of 
UMTS is smaller than that of WIFI. We study the NDMD 
(UMTS RSS<WIFI RSS) version because the RSS values of 
UMTS are very stable and not easy to be lower than the RSSthresh, 
thus NDMD may cause a MT to switch from WIFI to UMTS but 
not back again. In order to make an MT switch from UMTS 
back to WIFI, we replace the condition RSSthresh in NDMD by 
UMTS RSS < WIFI RSS. In both versions, we use the proposed 
parameters 0.15(α) and 2.25 (κ) in NDMD [11] simulation to 
make a fair comparison between experiments. 
We also use the RSS threshold-based handoff algorithm in 
[15] with RSSthresh (-70dBm) in the comparison. In the algorithm, 
an MT triggers a handoff when the RSS of the current 
connection (RSSold) is lower than RSSthresh and the target 
connection (RSSnew) is higher than RSSold. The most difficult 
part of RSS threshold-based algorithm is in configuring the 
RSSthresh. In the experiment, we used -70dBm as RSSthresh in the 
WIFI because it performed well in our experiment study. 
 
4.1 Experiment Configurations 
There are many external factors that have large impact on the 
performance of a handoff algorithm. To evaluate the 
PLA-NDMD algorithm, we use the QI value along with the DIF 
value to make handoff decision, and increase the accuracy of 
leaving and approaching state. Table 3 lists the overall 
environment parameters in the experiment. We set the DIFthresh 
to -1 the same as the lower DIF threshold in [11]'s simulation.

We use an ASUS Eee PC 1000HG laptop with an Azure 
Wave AW-GE780 mini PCI adapter and BandLuxe C170 USB 
dongle for UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications 
System) in experiments. We run a packet generator program 
that continuously sends packets to a desktop computer which 
has a large network bandwidth sufficient for data transmission. 
During the experiment, we moved around in the YZU campus to 
gather RSS samples and calculate the DIF value constantly. 
Meanwhile, if a TCP connection is available, we also collect

clustering techniques. MRSD is a novel model that is 
constructed with the MRA (Multi-Resolution Analysis) model 
and the ANNs model. It can classify input data by comparing 
with the training results quickly. Using MRSD, we can obtain 
some information such as relative speed of vehicles and 
motion detection when aggregating vehicles over VANET.  
 
The novelty of MRSD is in its ability to learn a vehicle’s 
speed and relative motion among vehicles based on the 
measured RSS (Received Signal Strength) samples received 
from a Road Side Unit (RSU). By applying various filtering 
schemes, such as MRSS [10] and MACD [11], over the RSS 
samples, MRSD transforms the RSS samples into useful input 
values for motion detection and speed learning. Then, MRSD 
uses ANNs to detect the relative speed of a vehicle and 
perform speed classification.  
 
If vehicles in a road segment belong to a cluster, we divide 
the cluster further into several groups based on the speed 
classification by MRSD. Since among all groups of vehicles in 
a cluster, the group with the largest number of vehicles will 
likely survive the longest time, it is desirable to elect a cluster 
head from the group so that the cluster leader won’t leave the 
cluster soon. Thus, we can obtain a stable cluster. 
 
Extensive simulation has been performed to examine the 
performance of MRSD and the presented clustering scheme. 
The results show that the MRSD can accurately detect vehicle 
speeds and properly classify vehicles with respect to their 
speeds. The clustering scheme based on MRSD also performs 
more stable than previous clustering schemes for MANET. 
II. MRSD 
MRSD detects the relative motion and relative speed of 
V2V and V2R. It extends the Multi-Resolution based Motion 
Detection (MRMD) to perform vehicle speed classification. 
The MRSD uses Multi-Layer neural networks scheme to 
establish models. In the following sections, the general model 
of Multi-Layer neural network scheme is introduced first. 
Then, the MRMD with two pattern units MACD and MRSS 
are described. Finally MRSD is presented. 
 
A. Multi-Layer Neural Network Scheme 
A neural network results by arranging the basic neuron 
model into various configurations. Multi-Layer neural network 
systems are popular techniques for tackling complex tasks. It 
often improves performance compared to single network 
systems by composing of “neurons” which are loosely 
modeled on biological neurons. However, Multi-Layer neural 
networks solve the classification problem for non linear sets 
by employing hidden layers. A layer between input and output 
is called hidden layer, whose neurons are not directly 
connected to the output. This network could map inputs 
flexibly to outputs. In Multi-Layer networks, they are able to 
implement any function between input and output layer. Thus, 
Multi-Layer neural networks can be applied on many practical 
applications [6].

B. MRMD 
MRMD is a model which combines wavelet theory and 
Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to predict the motion of a 
mobile node. As shown in Fig. 2, the MRMD model consists 
of five layers: (1) Wavelet Layer; (2) Input Unit Layer; (3) 
Pattern Unit Layer; (4) Summary Unit Layer; and (5) Output 
Unit Layer. 
The Wavelet Layer reduces noises of RSS samples by 
collecting a number of RSS samples and outputs their ARSS 
(Averaged RSS). The Input Unit Layer generates various 
indicators of ARSS change by adopting low pass filters, or 
Exponential Weighted Moving Average filters, with various 
cut-off frequencies or smoothing factor K. The smaller K is, 
the higher cut-off frequency of the low pass filter is, and the 
output indicator is more agile to the ARSS changes. With 
various values of K, the EWMA filter banks generate 
indicators of ARSS change with various sensitivities.

 Figure 6. MACD Model 
 
The MACD algorithm also uses a smoothing function to 
smooth RSS like that of the MRSS algorithm. Fig. 6 shows the 
operation of MACD in which two smoothing functions, each 
with different scale k are used to smooth the ARSS, and 
different low-pass filters can lead to different EWMA’s. 
Therefore, the high-pass filter H calculates the difference 
between MACDs with different scale k’s.  
 
Although both MRSS and MACD use smoothing 
functions, there is still a major difference between MRSS and 
MACD algorithms. As shown in Fig. 5, the value of MRSS is 
the high-pass value; it is the difference between two EWMAs 
with different time scale k. On the contrary, the value DIF of 
MACD is the high-pass value between two EWMAs that 
result from a smoothing function with different smoothing 
factor scale k’s. 
The outputs of MACD and MRSS could be positive or 
negative. A positive result indicates that the mobile node 
receives stronger signal strength than before. Thus it also 
indicates that the mobile node maybe approaching to AP. In 
the same way, the negative result indicates that the mobile 
node may be leaving from AP.  
D. MRSD 
The MRSD model enhances MRMD to suit the 
environment of VANET. It not only detects the motion of 
mobiles but also the speed of vehicles. To measure the speed 
of vehicles without the assistance of GPS, it adds a pattern 
unit layer, which includes the speed information of vehicles, to 
classify the speed levels of motion into many levels. Fig. 7 
illustrates a MRSD model that can classify vehicle speed into 
four classes: very high speed, high speed, medium speed and 
low speed.  
 
MRSD consists of two parts: the motion detection and the 
relative speed level detection. The motion detection part is 
similar to that of MRMD except that it uses ANNs model 
instead of PNN model because the ANNs model is simpler 
and quicker than the PNN model. To include the concept of 
speed, MRSD adds pattern units of various speeds from 
60~155 (km/h). The speed pattern units take outputs from all 
MRSS and MACD filter. Through offline training, MRSD can 
classify the speed of vehicles into various speed levels based 
on RSS samples. Thus, the output can be used as the basis of 
constructing a cluster over VANET. 
III. CLUSTERING METHODOLOGY BASED ON MRSD 
Mobile nodes in VANET can transfer data with one another 
or connect to AP of the roadside. Generally, the nodes would 
be put into a cluster to improve the transfer rate. Instead of 
using GPS devices to detect the position of a mobile node, this 
section presents a clustering algorithm that uses the MRSD 
model to aggregate a cluster in an efficient way. 
A. Clustering Scheme 
In our clustering scheme, each node broadcasts 
periodically its clustering information to other nodes in the 
same cluster for cluster formation and management. The 
cluster information is denoted by a 5-tuple (i,g,h,r, Nr), where 
i is the node ID; g is the cluster ID; h is the cluster head ID; r 
is the speed level (Very high=1, High=2, Medium=3, Low=4), 
and Nr is the number of vehicles with the same speed level in 
the cluster. An example of clustered vehicles is shown in Fig. 
8, where Node 3 is the cluster head (CH) of the cluster. In the 
example, {4,1,3,3,3} means that Node 4 is in a cluster with ID 
=1 and its cluster head has node id 3, the relative speed level is 
medium, and three nodes have speed level medium in this 
cluster. 
 
In the algorithm, we assume that RSUs (Road Side Units) 
are available along the road. Each vehicle receives the beacon

are much less than that of lowest ID and position-based

of nodes in the CH election process as shown in Fig. 11, 
which means it produces the least control message overhead 
among all compared clustering schemes. Thus, the speed-
based clustering scheme provides more stable clusters and less 
overhead in cluster management than that of previous schemes. 
 
V. CONCLUSION  
 
This paper proposed a model called Multi-resolution 
Relative Speed Detection (MRSD) to perform speed 
classification and motion detection without GPS. It combines 
MACD and MRSS features and extends MRMD for velocity 
classification. MRSD can classify velocity into various speed 
levels and two moving state, approaching or leaving without 
GPS. Based on the information gained from MRSD, we 
improve the cluster aggregation with speed classification. In 
the speed-based clustering scheme, we choose a cluster leader 
from the biggest group of a speed level in a cluster. With the 
simple strategy, we show by simulation that the presented 
clustering algorithm performs well in stabilizing clusters.

pattern classiﬁcation function of PNN, PNN-MSMD can identify the
user motion state. PNN-MSMD uses the MACD values and theMRSS
values of the basic moving operations (approaching, leaving, and
stationary) of a mobile node (MN) as the learning patterns in PNN.
After the learning process is completed, 17 motion sensors are used
tomeasure theMACDandMRSS values ofMN’s radio signalwhen an
MN ismoving. Themeasured results are used as the inputs of PNN to
identify the user motion state for enhancing the handoff perfor-
mance. The user motion states are classiﬁed as approaching state,
leaving state, and stationary state.When anMN is identiﬁed as leav-
ing state and its RSS is below a predeﬁned handoff trigger threshold,
the MN is allowed to trigger a handoff.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses methodology of PNN. Section 3 presents details of the pro-
posed PNN-MSMD model. Section 4 evaluates the performance of
PNN-MSMD. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.
2. Methodology
Probabilistic neural network (PNN) (Mao et al., 2002; Rutkowski,
2004; Specht, 1988, 1991; Streit & Luginbuhl, 1994; Zaknich, 1998)
is an effective method to solve many classiﬁcation problems, which
contains an input layer, a pattern layer, a summary layer and an
output layer. Fig. 1 shows a general PNNmodel. The PNN can classify
an unknown input vector X = hx1,x2,x3, . . . ,xni into a class y, y 2
{y1,y2, . . . ,yk}, from input layer. The PNN contains k classes and m
training patterns in Fig. 1. The WeightXPIP presents the weight value
between the input layer and the pattern layer, and theWeightPYPO pre-
sents the weight value between the pattern layer and the output
layer. The pattern layer cooperates with the summary layer to esti-
mate the probability density function (PDF) of each class yi, i =
1,2, . . . ,k for the input vector X by using a Gaussian radial basis func-
tion. The PDF for a single class yk is computed as

ð1Þ
where nk is the number of training patterns in the class yk, Xkj is the
jth training pattern from the class yk, d is the dimension of the input
vector X. The output layer classiﬁes the input vector X based on
summary layer outputs as
ClassðXÞ ¼ argmaxfpyk ðXÞg; k ¼ 1;2; . . . ;m; ð2Þ
where Class(X) is the estimated class of the input vector X.
We use PNN in our system because PNN has the following
features:
 PNN is easy to train, and its learning speed is very fast. The
weights of neural network are loaded from the learning pattern
directly. The learning pattern can be added and deleted directly
without re-train the neural network. Therefore, PNN is suitable
for real-time applications (e.g., seamless handoff).
 PNN is developed based on probabilistic theory. When a sufﬁ-
ciently large training sample is used, the PNN can converge to
the Bayesian theory.
 PNN is effective for analyzing non-linear time series signals. The
RSS is a kind of time series data. Thus, PNN is suitable for
detecting user motion and handoff applications.
3. User motion detection framework
An UMD service classiﬁes the user motion state according to the
RSS variation of a mobile device. A novel UMDmodel is proposed to
analyze the RSS of amobile device as Fig. 2 shown. The UMD service
ismodeled as a pattern classiﬁcation systemcalled PNN-MSMD. The
design of a pattern classiﬁcation system is divided into ﬁve steps:
data collection, feature selection, model selection, training and
evaluation.
In the data collection step, the training samples and testing
samples are sensed from the environment. The collected data are
then pre-processed to eliminate noise and invariant patterns. A sig-
nal analyzer in the proposed model provides a data pre-processing
function to smooth noise and RSS fading. The signal analyzer uses
multiple EWMA ﬁlters (smoothing ﬁlters) to eliminate noise in the
RSS signal input. After the RSS input is smoothed, the signal ana-
lyzer module applies various high pass ﬁlters, such as MACD ﬁlter
and MRSS ﬁlter, to take out the variation trend of the RSS signal.
Thus, the multiple signal processing sensors-based analyzer can
provide several RSS change information (or called signal patterns)
that represent the moving state of a mobile device.
The motion detection module provides the motion detection re-
sults by a pattern classiﬁcation mechanism. In the third step of
classiﬁcation system design, the model selection chooses a PNN
method as machine learning method. In the training stage of a
learning algorithm, the learning data should be selected from the
measured RSS samples. The pattern selector chooses the most
important patterns as the training samples. After learning process-
ing and testing processing (the evaluation step) are completed, the
learning algorithms can generate weighted functions, rules and
models required by the motion detection module to classify user
motion. Finally, when an MN is moving, the PNN-MSMD system
continuous monitors the RSS of current activating wireless net-
work interface and identiﬁes the user motion state.
3.1. Signal analyzer
The proposed PNN-MSMD model utilizes two high pass ﬁlters,
MACD ﬁlter and MRSS ﬁlter, in the signal analyzer. This subsection
presents the design of these ﬁlters in the PNN-MSMD.
3.1.1. MACD-based high pass ﬁlter
Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) technology
(Appel, 1985) is a trend-following indicator. The MACD ﬁlter (Chen
et al., 2008) is a high pass ﬁlter that separates the variance of the
measured RSS from two EWMA ﬁlters (low pass ﬁlters). The MACD
analysis requires two EWMA ﬁlters to calculate an agile estimate
A[i] and a stable estimate S[i] from the measured RSS R[i]. The mo-
tion state of a mobile device is then indicated by the difference
(DIF) between the two estimates.
The EWMA ﬁlter is deﬁned as
E½i ¼ ð1 aÞ  E½i 1 þ a R½i; ð3Þ
where 0 < a < 1, E[i] is the current estimated EWMA value, E[i  1] is
the prior estimated EWMA value, R[i] is the current measured RSS
value and a is a smoothing factor. If a is large, the estimate of
EWMA ﬁlter can rapidly change in response to the changes in the
measured RSS series. If a is small, the generated estimate can resist
the noise in individual observations but cannot react rapidly to
changes in the measured RSS series.
Let a and b be the smoothing factors for EWMA ﬁlters. The agile
estimate A[i] and the stable estimate S[i] are deﬁned as
A½i ¼ ð1 aÞ  A½i 1 þ a R½i; ð4Þ
S½i ¼ ð1 bÞ  S½i 1 þ b R½i; ð5Þ
where 0 < b < a < 1. The DIF between A[i] and S[i] is deﬁned as
DIF ¼ A½i  S½i: ð6Þ
The DIF can identify the user motion state. When an MN ap-
proaches an access point (AP) or base station (BS), the estimated
agile EWMA value increases faster than the estimated stable
EWMA values. Thus, the computed DIF value is positive. Otherwise,

training patterns. In the summary layer, the output of the pattern
layer is produced by a weight vector WeightPYPO which is also ob-
tained from training patterns. For example, a PNN uses four MACD
sensors in its input layer and uses three patterns including an
approaching case, a leaving case, and a stationary case. Tables 4
and 5 show the weight values between input layer and pattern
layer (WeightXPIP ) and the weight values between pattern layer
and output layer (WeightPYPO).
The summary layer then sums the probability of each class from
the pattern layer. According to Eq. (2), the class of the input vector
X can be decided in the output layer. The motion state with the
highest probability is the pattern classiﬁcation result. Thus, the
user motion detection (UMD) results of the PNN-MSMD model is
deﬁned as
UMD ¼
approaching; if classðXÞ ¼ approaching;
leaving; if classðXÞ ¼ leaving;
stationary; if classðXÞ ¼ stationary:

3.3. PNN-MSMD-based handoff algorithm
The PNN-MSMD model provides user motion detection results
to help an MN to activate or terminate its network discovery inter-
face for conserving power and reducing handoff dropout rate. In
PNN-MSMD-based handoff algorithms, when the RSS of current
associated base station (RSSold) is lower than a pre-deﬁned handoff
threshold (THHO), the mobile device must execute the handoff pro-
cedure right away to avoid the communication broken. Before
switching to another network, a network discovery threshold
(THND) must be high enough to give the mobile device sufﬁcient
time to perform network discovery procedures and other high-layer
signaling functions. However, a high RSS threshold substantially
increases power consumption. Hence, three network discovery
modes are deﬁned according to the user motion detection results
to reduce power consumption.
 NONND mode: the network discovery is unneeded when a
mobile device is approaching an AP or BS. Thus, a mobile device
is set as NONND mode when it is in the approaching state.
 ND mode: a mobile device must activate its interfaces for
detecting all available wireless networks when it is leaving
the associated AP or BS. So, an ND mode is used when a mobile
device is in the leaving state.
 SEMIND mode: a mobile device is set as SEMIND mode when it is
stationary. In this mode, if RSSold < THHO, the mobile device
must perform network discovery procedure and handoff proce-
dure. Otherwise, the mobile device terminates the network dis-
covery process.
When a mobile device connects to an AP, its RSS and user mo-
tion are determined continuously. When the RSS is below or above
the predeﬁned RSS thresholds given above, the mobile device
changes to a suitable network discovery mode to activate or termi-
nate its interfaces.
4. Performance analysis
This section describes the results of extensive computer simula-
tions for performance comparisons of the proposed PNN-MSMD
based handoff algorithm, MACD-based handoff algorithm (Chen
et al., 2008), and MRSS-based handoff algorithm (Chung et al.,
2009). In all simulations, a log-normal shadowing model in NS2
simulator (NS2 group, n.d.) and the BonnMotion node-movement
generation tool (Aschenbruck, n.d.) were used. User movement
trajectories were simulated using a simple straight movement tra-
jectory and the random waypoint mobility model. In the ﬁrst

WiMAX environment, the size of simulation topology was 9000 m2,
and the distance between two adjacent APs was 1800 m. A random
waypoint mobility model was adopted to simulate a user move-
ment trajectory in the Mobile WiMAX environment.
The performances of the proposed PNN-MSMD-based handoff
algorithms were compared with those of various RSS threshold-
based handoff algorithms (ETSI & GSM Technical Speciﬁcation,
2000; Shirvani Moghaddam et al., 2000) and the geographic-based

of a neighborhood base stations (RSSnew) is higher than RSSold. The
hysteresis mechanism avoids the ping-pong effect by changing the
handoff trigger condition as RSSnew > RSSold + H. On the other hand,
the dwell time is the time interval that a mobile device stays in the
overlapped area of two APs. In the RSS threshold-based handoff
algorithm, the handoff trigger condition must be satisﬁed and kept
over the dwell time, then the mobile device is allowed to trigger a
handoff. The RSS threshold-based handoff algorithm can apply the
dwell time mechanism and the hysteresis mechanism simulta-
neously. In the geographic-based handoff algorithm, a mobile de-
vice initiates a handoff according to a GPS and a location
information server.
Tables 8 and 9 present the parameters and thresholds of various
algorithms. In the simulation, a pre-processing delay was intro-
duced to represent latency in the network discovery procedure
including the times required to turn on all interfaces, scan chan-
nels, associate with a chosen AP, etc. In the simulation, each case
was run 1000 times.
The performance of motion detection services was evaluated in
terms of power consumption, number of handoffs, number of failed
handoffs and motion detection delay.

 Motion detection delay: A motion detection service must detect
user motion quickly so that the wireless VoIP system can has
sufﬁcient time to perform seamless handoff and to stop net-
work discovery immediately when the user is stationary.
 Power consumption: In the network discovery mode (ND
mode), a mobile device must turn on all its interfaces for
searching new base stations. Thus, a larger accumulated all
interfaces activated time represents larger power consumption.
 Number of handoffs: In a wireless VoIP service, delay and jitter
may impair quality. A VoIP application may temporarily stop
transmitting whenever a mobile device switches its connection
between different APs. Thus, unnecessary handoffs may
decrease transmission performance and VoIP quality.
 Number of failed handoffs: Since discovering available net-
works may require substantial time, a handoff may fail if a
mobile device starts network discovery late. Moreover, fading
may cause RSS variation and unnecessary handoffs that
increases the risk of broken connections due to handoff failure.
A good motion detection method should reduce the number of
failed handoffs.
Figs. 10–13 compare the performance evaluation results for the
handoff algorithms in a Mobile WiMAX environment. Fig. 10 illus-
trates the average motion detection delay of the proposed PNN-
MSMD based handoff algorithm. In Fig. 10, MACD has the longest
motion detection delay because it is less sensitive than MRSS and
PNN-MSMD. The MRSS method using a larger smoothing factor
(a) could detect the user motion faster than other algorithms.
The MRSS could analyze the high frequency components of RSS,
which increased the speed of user motion detection but also
caused excessive power consumption. Moreover, the motion
detection delay of PNN-MSMD is similar to the MRSS method
(a = 0.16).
Fig. 11 shows the accumulated active time of all interfaces in
various approaches. In Fig. 11, the traditional RSS threshold-based
methods consume more power than the proposed PNN-MSMD ap-
proach. In the RSS threshold-based handoff method and the hyster-
esis-combined methods, mobile devices turn on all interfaces to
search available access networks and execute handoff procedure
based only on THND, THHO and hysteresis. On the other hand, the
dwell time methods require mobile devices to remain in network
discovery for the duration of the dwell time. Thus, the basic RSS
threshold-based methods, the dwell time-combined methods and
the hysteresis-combined methods consume more power compared
to most machine learning-based approaches.
The PNN-MSMD method can identify user motion state. If the
mobile device is in an approach state or a stationary state, the mo-
bile device turns off other interfaces to reduce power consumption.
PNN-MSMD decomposes a radio signal into various MACD and
MRSS by several EWMA ﬁlters and employs a PNN model to inte-
grate the impact of these MACD and MRSS analysis results. Thus,
the PNN-MSMD-based algorithm is more sensitive than other algo-
rithms. The PNN-MSMD can trigger network discovery when the
mobile device is moving a short distance, and can also terminate
the network discovery process faster than other algorithms when
the mobile device is approaching its associated AP. Thus, the
PNN-MSMD-based handoff algorithms have lower power con-
sumption. The PNN-MSMD method can save up to 82.56% power
consumption than the RSS threshold combined with hysteresis
and dwell time-based handoff algorithm.
Fig. 12 illustrates the accumulated number of handoffs. In
Fig. 12, the geographic-based handoff method has the lowest num-
ber of handoff because it triggers the handoff process according to
the location information of the mobile device from GPS and a loca-
tion server. The RSS threshold-based handoff algorithm causes the
largest number of handoff because the mobile device always trig-
gers handoffs when the mobile device is in a stationary state.
The dwell time-combined methods and the hysteresis-combined
methods limit the handoff trigger by a dwell time constraint and
a hysteresis. Thus, the mobile device triggers handoff late and

2. Literature review
As wireless network technologies ﬂourish, many research ef-
forts (Bari & Leung, 2007; Blefari-Melazzi, Di Sorte, Femminella,
& Reali, 2007; Charilas, Markaki, Nikitopoulos, & Theologou,
2008; Chen & Yang, 2007; Homayounvala & Aghvami, 2005; Joe,
Kim, & Hong, 2008; Song & Jamalipour, 2005a, 2005b) have ad-
dressed the issues of ABC services. In Chen and Yang (2007),
authors present the concept and architecture of an ABC solution
in 4G network. Usually, researchers consider many factors in ABC
when selecting an access network. In Joe et al. (2008), the authors
take RSS (Received Signal Strength), access network type, mone-
tary cost of services, QoS requirements of applications, and power
consumption into account in choosing a network. In addition to the
above factors (Bari & Leung, 2007; Blefari-Melazzi et al., 2007;
Charilas et al., 2008; Homayounvala & Aghvami, 2005; Song &
Jamalipour, 2005a, 2005b) also considers user preferences to make
the access network selection more ﬂexible.
When both user preference and attributes of access networks
are considered in network selection, the problem of ABC can be
readily formulated as a problem of MCDM. Song and Jamalipour
(2005b) use a GRA method to rank the candidate access networks
and select the one with the largest value. In Charilas et al. (2008),
the authors combine the AHP method and the GRA method to se-
lect a network that can offer the best QoS. In Blefari-Melazzi et al.
(2007), the authors represent the importance of considered
parameters a weight and then propose a simple additive weight-
ing based network selection method. Bari and Leung (2007) use a
TOPSIS method to select the best access network. By using the
TOPSIS method, a network that has the shortest distance to the
ideal solution and the longest distance to the worst solution is
chosen.
The aforementioned work, however, mainly focused on selec-
tion of an access network based on QoS requirement of an applica-
tion. Although previous work also considered end-to-end delay,
they do not discuss the cost penalty when the source handset
and its correspondent handset communicate with networks owned
by different operator and of different type. Thus, their solutions do
not reﬂect the reality in practice. Furthermore, they mainly focus
on access network selection instead of session selection and hence
cannot provide users with an economical and efﬁcient communica-
tion service in 4G wireless network.
Recently, the telecommunication community has paid attention
to the multi-mode communication issue. 3GPP is making an effort
in supporting multi-mode handsets of cellular systems, WiFi and
WiMAX for voice communication. The 3GPP deﬁnes Voice Call Con-
tinuity (VCC) function (Salkintzis, Hammer, Tanaka, & Wong, 2009)
to provide seamless voice communication for multi-mode hand-
sets. Although the work of VCC is still pretty primitive, it conﬁrms
that it is imperative for us to use a ﬁner-grain paradigm for voice
communication between multi-mode handsets. Our previous work
(Chung et al., 2008) has presented a smart session selection (S3)
model to addressing the voice session selection problem. Based
on multiple criteria, we selects a pair of source and destination
access network for users by using AHP. However, as multimedia
communication, such as video phone, prevails, AHP is insufﬁcient
to model the complex problem of multimedia session selection.
Thus, a new solution scheme is needed to solve the multimedia call
setup problem.
3. Multimedia call setup strategy
A multimedia call is consisted of three types of media session,
voice, video and data session. Each session corresponds to a con-
catenation of source access network and destination access net-
work. A multimedia call is associated with several important
attributes that are concerned by users. In this study, we consider
the following attributes: media type, cost, battery living time, qual-
ity and security (Chung et al., 2008; Gustafsson & Jonsson, 2003).
Based on the signiﬁcance of media type and the personal interest
in cost, quality, power consumption and security of a call, we
weight these attributes and formulate the multimedia call setup
(MCS) problem as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)
problem. By solving MCS, we are able to set up a multimedia
call to best meet user’s interest and to achieve high quality user
communication.
The MCS problem can be re-stated as follows: Given source
handset S and correspondent handset C, each with m and n
interfaces to access networks ASi ; 0 < i 6 m and A
C
j ; 0 < j 6 n,
respectively. There exist m n candidate network connections,
S ¼ fSij ¼ ðASi ;ACj Þ; 0 < i 6 m; 0 < j 6 ng available for establishing
a multimedia call. Assume the signiﬁcance of data, voice and vi-
deo session in user communication is known for a given appli-
cation, and each session is associated with a set of criteria, such
as cost, quality, power consumption and security, conﬁgured by
the user. Then the MCS problem is to select one of the candi-
date network connections for multimedia call setup such that
the call can offer the best communication quality and meet user
preference.
3.1. Access network characteristics
A network connection is characterized by the source and desti-
nation access networks. Before we deﬁne the characteristics of a
network connection, we must characterize ﬁrst an access network.
An access network Ai, depends on its type, may have different
power consumption and security protection, and owned by differ-
ent operators. Furthermore, as wireless communication technology
advances, various adaptive modulation techniques have been
adopted to trade off wireless link capacity and data transmission
reliability. Thus, mobile nodes accessing to the same network type
may have different link capacity and packet loss probability
depending on their locations. On the other hand, even a mobile
node with the same link capacity may have different effective
transmission rate in a network such as WiFi, in which mobile
nodes compete accessing to an access point (AP). In such a multi-
media access wireless network, the link capacity alone does not
provide sufﬁcient information for decision making. However, to
simplify the decision making process, we only use last mile link
capacity and simplify the attribute of an access network by using
a 4-tuple (PFi, Li, Pi, SLi), where PFi, Li, Pi and SLi denote the access
network proﬁle, link proﬁle, power consumption rate and security
level of Ai, respectively. Table 1 lists the deﬁnition and detail fac-
tors of these attributes.
3.2. Multimedia call characteristics
A multimedia call is consisted of three types of media session,
voice, video and data session, and the characteristics of a session
F.-C. Yuan et al. / Expert Systems with Applications 39 (2012) 1298–1305 1299
use AES encryption algorithm (Daemen & Rijmen, 2002) for
access security. A wireless communication system can increase
security by increasing the length of the AES key. Thus, the voice
session security level is determined by the AES key size, which
is deﬁned as SLij = min(SLi, SLj). For example, if a WLAN access
point does not enable any security protocols such as WEP, the
value of SL(WLAN) is zero.
With the attributes of each session and the signiﬁcance of each
media type in communication, we apply ANP to select one candi-
date network connection that can satisfy user preference while
offering high quality communication.
3.3. MCS user proﬁle
A user deﬁnes the preference and constraint of network connec-
tions through a user proﬁle. Based on the user proﬁle, MCS chooses
a network connection available to the best interest of users. Fig. 1
shows the prototype of a multimedia user proﬁle. In Fig. 1, a user
proﬁle is divided into two parts, system and net. The former in-
cludes general conﬁguration and QoS requirements of a user for
his/her multimedia services. There are three parameters in the gen-
eral conﬁguration, network criteria priority, media type priority
and power threshold. Network criteria priority deﬁnes the attribute
priority, including cost, quality, power consumption and security in
selecting a network connection. The media type priority speciﬁes
the signiﬁcance of voice, video and data of a multimedia call. Based
on the priority selected by users and applications, weights are as-
signed to respective criteria and media type in MCS. The power
threshold represents the residual power in percentage belowwhich
some interface consuming large energy is disabled. QoS require-
ments include minimum bandwidth, maximum frame error rate
and maximum delay. Both power threshold and QoS requirements
place constraint on network connections in MCS.
The ‘‘net’’ provides the network proﬁle of an access network.
The network proﬁle includes not only the information mentioned
above in access network attributes but also user account related
information such as user name, password, and WEP key when
the user accesses the network.

example for multimedia communication between source and cor-
respondent handsets, each with three interfaces, WLAN, UMTS
and WiMAX. Thus, we have 9 candidate network connections
for voice communication between them. We assume the maximal
transmission rate of WLAN is 54 Mbps, the transmission rate of
UMTS (with HSPA) is 14.4 Mbps for download and 5.76 Mbps
for upload, the transmission rate of Mobile WiMAX is 31 Mbps
download and 23 Mbps for upload (Alim, Elboghdadly, Ashour,
& Elaskary, 2007).
In the example, we assume the network connections WiMAX–
WLAN, UMTS–WLAN, and WiMAX–UMTS can not satisﬁed user’s
QoS requirements. Assume after eliminating some network con-
nections that do not satisfy QoS requirements and the user prefer-
ence, the feasible alternative set S = {candidate networks S11:
WLAN–WLAN, S12: WLAN–UMTS, S13: WLAN–WiMAX, S22:
UMTS–UMTS, S23: UMTS–WiMAX, S33: WiMAX–WiMAX}.
Furthermore, 7 decision attributes, including 4 criterions such
as cost (C), power consumption (P), quality of service (QoS), Secu-
rity Level (SL), and 3 media such as video, data, and audio are
determined to evaluate those alternatives. The relevant factors
are clustered into criteria and media clusters. Then 6 decision net-
works are clustered into the alternatives cluster. Fig. 4 is a view of
the overall ANP model constructed by the professional software
named ‘‘Super Decisions’’.
Step 2: Pair-wise comparison
This study is applied to two experts representing caller and cal-
lee. Each expert makes a pair-wise comparison of the decision ele-
ments in criteria and media clusters with respect to the goal in the
hierarchy. Their judgment of the importance of one element over
another can be made subjectively. As for the pair-wise comparison
of the elements in alternatives cluster with respect to the criteria
and media are based on the research data objectively. Either sub-
jective or objective judgments can then be converted to a numer-
ical value using a scale of 1–9 where 1 denoted equal importance
and 9 denotes the highest degree of importance.
In this model there are 9 pair-wise matrices for each expert.

comparison matrix from each of the two experts are all below
0.1 indicating ‘‘consistency’’ as suggested by Satty (1980). To be
concise, only pair-wise matrices for caller have been reproduced
in this paper. Table 3 presents the pair-wise comparison matrix
of the criteria under the parent node of goal (W21) along with the
priority vector, also known as eigen-vector (e-vector), and the con-
sistency ratio (CR) less than 0.1. Table 4 shows the pair-wise com-
parison matrix of the media under the parent node of goal (W31).
Table 5 and 6 presents the weights of the 6 alternatives based on
each criterion (W42) and medium (W43), respectively.
Step 3: Supermatrix formation
Fig. 5 shows the generalized form of the supermatrix. Table 7
presents the super-matrix after entering the prioritized values
from respective vectors and matrices. In order to evaluate the
weights of elements, the limiting process method of the powers
of the supermatrix was employed. Table 8 and 9 presents the ﬁnal
limit matrix for caller and callee, respectively. Due to brevity, only
the limit matrix has been reproduced for callee. This limit matrix is
column stochastic and represents the ﬁnal eigenvector.
Indeed, the calculations of the supermatrix can be easily solved
by using ‘‘Super Decisions’’. At the ﬁnal stage of decision process,
the aggregation of the results obtained by ANP for two experts is
performed. After standard ANP synthesis is performed for each ex-
pert and overall priorities of the alternatives were obtained as
shown in Table 8 and 9, the group decision is derived by using geo-
metric mean (GM) or weighted arithmetic mean (WAM), which can
be used to bind the group and reconcile conﬂicting judgments even
when the group members my be unequal levels of inﬂuence. Table
10 presents individual priority vectors for two experts, aggregated
priorities and corresponding ranking of the alternatives, indicating
S11 was the ﬁrst choice between caller and callee.
5. Conclusion
Multimedia communication will prevail soon as handsets with
multimedia features are getting cheaper. However, how to offer
users economical and good quality multimedia services is still a
challenge issue. This paper presents a multimedia call setup
(MCS) scheme to address this issue. MCS can intelligently select
the access network pairs of caller and callee by modeling the mul-
timedia communication as a multi-criteria decision making
(MCDM) problem. The attributes of an access network and the
criteria in evaluating a network connection is introduced. The
user proﬁle which enables users to encode their preference for
MCS is also brieﬂy introduced. Finally, with media priority, user
preference and attributes of network connections, ANP is applied
to choose a best network connection for users.

題目 
本次參加 IEEE 在泰國 PHUKET 所舉辦的未來電腦網路及應用會議， 
來自世界各國的學者齊聚一堂，內容非常的豐富並多元化。會議舉辦地點位於 
Patong 的 Mercure 飯店。 
一、 與會心得 
  此次會議由韓國 IEEE 區域協會主辦，參加的學者來自 20 多個國家。Keynote 
有法國學者 Prof. Pascal Lorenz 對 QoS 與 QoE 在各資訊系統中所提供的機制
作深入的介紹，與韓國 Smart Space計畫主持人 Dr. Yoon則介紹韓國目前在 Smart 
Space 的發展近況。在會中我也多方與各國學者認識與交換意見。其中法國的 
Prof. Noury 是現在歐盟中作 Smart Space 的資深研究員，在醫學 Sensor 與網
路控制方面卓有成就。Prof. Edoardo Biagioni 曾到成功大學講學，在無線網路
應用上有極多的創意。也結識幾位此屆主辦 ICFUN 的韓國學者:Prof. Jeong, 
Prof. Jang 與 Prof. Yoo 等，也表達以後合作的可能。 
   本人此次也主動擔任 Session Chair，與其他學者溝通並交換意見。 
在聽過許多論文的發表，覺得 ICFUN 有許多品質不錯的論文，水準在中 
上，台灣也需要努力，發展由台灣發起之高品質國際會議。總而言之， 
此行不論在與各國學者的互動、對泰國文化的體驗與學術研究的啟發都 
有不虛此行之感。

Abstract—Integration of different wireless networks can provide a 
universal ubiquitous coverage and various transmission rates for 
Mobile Terminals (MTs). To achieve ubiquitous computing, an 
MT needs to switch or handoff its connection between different or 
similar types of wireless networks. Our previous work used 
NDMD (Network Discovery based on user Motion Detection) that 
triggers network discovery based on an MT’s motion and Received 
Signal Strength (RSS) to assist handoff decision. However, due to 
multipath fading, a wireless signal is strongly affected by 
environment and hence the motion detection based on RSS in 
NDMD may not be accurate. Thus, in this paper, we exploit a cross 
layer approach called packet loss aware NDMD, or PLA-NDMD, 
that uses TCP CWND (Congestion Window Size) as a packet loss 
index in couple with NDMD to cope with the problem. Experiment 
results show that PLA-NDMD can trigger a MT to perform 
handoff at appropriate timings and improve the data transmission 
throughput between MT and a wired station.

I. INTRODUCTION 
ith recent advancement in wireless technologies, some 
Mobile Terminals(MTs) already have capability to 
access heterogeneous wireless networks such as Wireless Local 
Area Network (WLAN), Wireless Metropolitan Area Network 
(WMAN), and 3G cellular Network (WWAN), which 
commonly construct a ubiquitous environment. To maintain 
high quality of services in a heterogeneous wireless network 
environment, an MT needs to switch its connection between 
different or similar types of wireless networks “seamlessly” 
when it moves out of the signal coverage of an AP. The process 
to change a connection from the original AP to a new AP is 
called handoff process. 
A handoff process can be divided into three stages [1]：
handoff initiation, network selection and handoff execution. In 
the first stage, an MT turns on all its wireless interfaces to 
discover which wireless networks are available. This process 
consumes much battery power. After that, the MT can obtain a

Taiwan, under contract NSC100-2221-E-155-040. 
 
 
 list of available networks. Then, at the second stage, the MT 
needs to select the best access network. The network evaluation 
and selection method is the key work in this stage. In the third 
stage, the MT executes a handoff process to switch its 
connection so that the connection can remain un-interrupted. 
Many researches [2]-[4] have indicated that the handoff 
initiation step has large impacts on the performance of handoff. 
Network discovery mechanisms can be divided into three 
categories [5]: proactive method, reactive method and 
location-aware method. The proactive method constantly 
monitors available wireless networks and hence all of the MT’s 
interfaces must remain active all the time. Thus, it consumes 
large battery power. On the other hand, the reactive method uses 
some specific thresholds to trigger network discovery. It can 
save more battery power than that of the proactive method, but 
increase the handoff dropping rate. The location-aware scheme 
uses the location information of APs and MTs to direct a MT to 
make handoff at the right time. However, this scheme cannot 
function properly at the places where GPS (Global Position 
Service) does not work.  
In the past, researchers proposed a reactive method called 
Network Discovery based on Motion Detection (NDMD) [11] 
to reduce power consumption while improving the handoff 
quality. NDMD adopts a trend indicator called Moving Average 
Convergence Divergence (MACD) to detect the motion of an 
MT. The authors indicate that NDMD can indeed achieve good 
performance than previous handoff algorithms. However, since 
wireless signal suffers from multiple path fading, RSS will 
depend on where the MT’s location is and may fluctuate 
drastically, which make NDMD fail to detect user’s motion 
correctly.  
A close look at current handoff algorithms reveals that the 
true concern in handoff decision is actually on the quality of 
data transmission but not on the magnitude of RSS. Thus, this 
paper presented a packet loss aware NDMD, or PLA-NDMD, to 
cope with the problem of NDMD. PLA-NDMD utilizes a 
cross-layer approach to improve handoff quality of NDMD. 
Along with NDMD, it exploits the TCP Congestion Window 
Size (CWND) at the transport layer to accurately detect packet 
loss rate so that transmission quality can be better captured.  
To verify the performance of PLA-NDMD, we did 
experiments in the YZU campus with a dual-mode notebook. 
We collected RSS and CWND samples on two heterogeneous 
networks, WLAN and UMTS (Universal Mobile

Figure 3   Architecture of PLA-NDMD in the protocol stack 
with a cross layer design 
 
(MIH) [12] middleware makes various wireless MAC protocols 
transparent to upper layers. PLA-NDMD utilizes MIH to get 
RSS samples from the physical layer and the CWND size from 
TCP to perform handover services. 
PLA-NDMD refers to the CWND variation as an index of 
transmission quality. In TCP congestion control, CWND 
decreases when packet loss occurs, and increases or remains at 
its maximal value when packets are successfully transmitted. 
With this observation, we can have the following rules: Given 
the samples of CWNDnow and CWNDLast value. 
 If CWNDnow > CWNDLast, the transmission quality is 
good. 
 If CWNDnow < CWNDLast, the transmission quality gets 
worse. 
 When CWNDnow = CWNDLast, the transmission quality 
depends on the network type as indicated in Table 2 and to 
be explained below. 
We regarded a sample of good transmission quality as a 
success, and worse transmission quality as a fail. Then, we 
sample the number of success and fail every 2 seconds and 
compute a novel index called Quality Index (QI) as follows. 
nn
n
n
failsuccess
fail
QI

'                                           (3-1) 
And then we derive an on line average of Quality Index (QI) by 
a low pass filter as follows: 
'
1 )1( nnn QIQIQI                                        (3-2) 
When the QI value is small the transmission quality is good. 
On the contrary, when the QI value is large, the transmission 
quality is poor. Here in this paper, the value of α in Eq. (3-2) 
is set as 0.9. Note that the congestion control scheme we used 
is CUBIC, which is a less aggressive and more systematic 
derivative of BIC TCP [13]. In CUBIC [14], the concave 
portion of the congestion window quickly ramps up to the 
window size before the last congestion event. After a TCP 
connection registers CWNDmax to be the window size, 
CUBIC performs a multiplicative decrease of congestion 
window by factors of window decrease constant when a loss 
event occurred, similar to  the regular fast recovery and 
retransmission of TCP. Then, it enters the congestion 
avoidance from fast recovery and starts to increase the 
window by using the concave profile of the CUBIC function. 
The convex grows when CUBIC probes for more bandwidth. 
It is slow at the very beginning, but becomes rapid soon. 
CUBIC spends a lot of time at a plateau between the concave 
and convex growth region, which allows the network to 
stabilize before CUBIC begins to look for more bandwidth. 
When the network bandwidth is small, CUBIC can remain at 
a constant but non-maximal CWND value for a long time. 
This is because the round trip delay is large. On the contrary, 
when network bandwidth is large, it is hard to keep CWND at 
a non-maximal CWND constant value. Based on the 
observation, we summary the above rules in Table 2, where 
we regard a non-maximal CWND constant as a fail for WIFI 
but as a success for UMTS because WIFI has a much larger 
bandwidth than that of UMTS. 
When both WIFI and UMTS are available, we use the 
following observation to determine which network to access or 
use. 
－ WIFI mode: The transmission capacity is usually larger 
than UMTS. The RSS can be easily affected by obstacles.  
－ UMTS mode: The RSS coverage is large. (more stable 
than WIFI)  
Table 2  Decision rules of quality index 
 
 During the journey of a mobile node, the mobile node may 
switch between WIFI and UMTS mode to maintain good quality 
of network services. In the UMTS mode, we basically apply 
NDMD to decide the handoff timing while in the WIFI mode, 
we apply our presented PLA-NDMD scheme. Figure 4 and 
Figure 5 show the respective flow charts for UMTS and WIFI 
mode. At the UMTS mode,  handoff is initiated when the DIF of 
UMTS is below DIFthresh and the RSS of UMTS is smaller than 
WIFI. In the WIFI mode, however, an MT will trigger a handoff 
process when QI = 100%.

4.2 EXPERIMENT ANALYSIS 
 This section compares the performance of PLA-NDMD 
based on handoff timing and throughput. In the experiment 
scenario, we carried an MT and climbed up stairs from the first 
floor to the sixth floor in the YZU hall 7 and the starting point is 
near the location of an AP. We collected the RSS samples 
continuously in one hundred seconds and the curve of RSS 
values is drawn as shown in Figure 6, in which the x-axis 
represents the experiment time from the starting point to the end, 
and the y-axis represents the RSS value between the best 
(-50dBm) and the worst (-84dBm). Figure 7 is the calculated 
DIF value curve obtained by the NDMD algorithm.

of various handoff schemes including NDMD (UMTS 
RSS=-84dBm), NDMD (UMTS RSS<WIFI RSS), RSS 
threshold-based, and PLA-NDMD with α=0.9. The result shows 
that after the 50th second, the curves of NDMD throughput tend 
to be flat but the throughput with PLA-NDMD increased 
steadily. The RSS threshold-based algorithm did handoff at the 
earliest time and caused the least accumulated throughput. Thus, 
the PLA-NDMD performs better than that of the NDMD and 
RSS threshold-based schemes.

V. CONCLUSION  
 In this paper, we proposed a packet loss aware NDMD 
algorithm (PLA-NDMD) to do network discovery in a 
heterogeneous wireless network environment. PLA-NDMD 
utilizes a cross-layer design between physical, data link and 
transport layer. It exploits RSS samples from the physical layer, 
based on which the motion of a MT is detected, just like NDMD. 
Moreover, it makes use of TCP CWND in the transport layer to 
derive transmission quality, or packet loss information, of 
current access network. Experiment results have shown that the 
packet loss information could assist the MT to do handoff 
process at a better timing, and make MT activate the interfaces 
to do network discovery in time. With PLA-NDMD, a MT can 
achieve larger throughput than that of NDMD and traditional 
RSS threshold-based handoff schemes.

Abstract—Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) has emerged as 
a new wireless network for vehicular communications. To 
provide a flexible and high reliable communication service in 
VANET, vehicles are clustered to construct many small networks 
(clusters) so that channel interferences and flooding messages can 
be limited. This research presents a novel Multi-resolution 
Relative Speed Detection (MRSD) model to improve the 
clustering algorithm in VANET without using GPS. MRSD uses 
the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the 
Momentum of Received Signal Strength (MRSS), and Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate the motion state and the 
relative speed of a vehicle based purely on Received Signal 
Strength. The proposed MRSD model is accurate with the 
assistance of the intelligent classification, and incurs less 
overhead in the cluster head election than that of other 
algorithms.

(VANET) becomes an emerging new type of ad hoc wireless 
networks with high speed mobility, which envisions inter/intra 
vehicle communications. These communications could be 
categorized into Vehicle to Roadside (V2R) units and Vehicle 
to Vehicle (V2V) communication. Because both V2R and 
V2V could be required to transfer data (e.g., safety message, 
video data), the present and future wireless technologies are 
expected to provide a high transmission rate and reliability 
over highly mobile networks. 
 
One of the effective schemes in boosting communication 
performance in VANET is by clustering vehicles into groups, 
as illustrated in Fig. 1, so as to reduce interference among 
vehicles’ communication. However, clustering in VANET 
becomes very challenging because of the speeds of vehicles

and rapid topology changing, even though the movement of 
vehicles is somewhat predictable.  According to [7][9], the 
message path in VANET can typically survive only one 
minute while maintaining a transmission range of 500 meters. 
So VANET may suffer frequent partition and merging 
resulting in great overheads for new topology information 
exchange and vehicles reconfiguration. Therefore, how to 
cluster vehicles efficiently is a very interesting issue in 
VANET now. 
 
In the past, many clustering algorithms have been 
proposed for mobile ad hoc wireless networks (MANETs) [5]. 
However, their topology management approaches [1][2][4] are 
not designed for high speed vehicular environment. Thus, their 
schemes could produce substantial overhead when clusters 
partition and merge frequently. To reduce overhead, some 
researchers have proposed to utilize GPS devices to identify 
locations of vehicles and perform position-based clustering 
[3][8][12][13]. However, GPS has some drawbacks. First, 
regular GPS technique used without any specialized 
equipment can have a low level accuracy. Secondly, GPS does 
not work in locations where no line of sight exists, e.g., in a 
tunnel or in a cloudy day. Finally, the personal security and 
privacy should be considered inclusively. Because the 
exchanged information between vehicles is realistic position 
data, people with intensions can track the others’ behavior 
easily and freely. Thus, an efficient clustering scheme without 
GPS devices for VANET is desirable. 
 
This research presents a novel speed-based clustering 
scheme for VANET without GPS. In our work, the MRSD 
model is used to replace the GPS devices and to improve the 
The Pattern Unit Layer generates various indicators for 
the relative motion between the mobile node and the AP 
considered. It evaluates the considered moving state of a 
mobile node by using various MACD and MRSS filters, to be 
detailed later. These indicators have different sensitivities in 
detecting motion and hence can allow us to accurately 
estimate the state of motion. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the 
schematic diagrams of MRSS and MACD respectively. The 
MRSS filter is a high pass filter that takes many consecutive 
outputs of a EWMA filter as inputs and output their difference. 
The MACD filter produces a trend indicator by calculating the 
difference (DIF) between the outputs of two EWMA filters 
with different smoothing factors. Based on the configuration 
of MRSS and MACD, we can readily see that the number of 
MRSS pattern units is equal to the number of EWMA filters 
while the number of MACD pattern units can be readily 
calculated as follows:

where Numberinputlayer denotes the number of EWMA filters in 
the Input Unit Layer. Thus, if Numberinputlayer equal to 9, the 
total numbers of MACD pattern units is 36. 
The Summary Unit Layer identifies two states: 
approaching node and leaving node as illustrated in Fig. 5. 
Both nodes calculate the strength degree according to the 
results from the Pattern Unit Layer. The approaching node 
puts all positive results as MEANapp from the previous layer 
and calculate appNet while the leaving node puts all negative 
results as MEANlev and calculate levNet  in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) 
respectively. The active functions, as shown in Eq. (4) and Eq. 
(5), indicate the motion degree of user.

Finally, the Output Unit Layer compares the results from 
the leaving node and the approaching node in the Summary 
Unit Layer. If the approaching degree of motion is bigger than 
leaving degree, i.e, levapp ff  , the Output Unit Layer 
indicates that the mobile node is approaching to AP; otherwise, 
i.e, levapp ff  , the mobile leaves AP. Therefore, MRMD 
determines a bias value by a Summary Unit according to the 
signal strength of leaving or approaching state and chooses the 
state of motions accordingly. When levapp ff  , the state is 
stationary.

C. MRSS and MACD 
The MRSS model calculates the difference value between 
two consecutive smoothed RSS samples as shown in Fig. 5. 
The computation process of MRSS can be divided into three 
steps. First, an ARSS is computed over T RSS samples as 
expressed in Eq. (6). Then, an Exponential Weighted Moving 
Average (EWMA) is used to smooth ARSSes and keeps 
EWMA stable. Finally, the MRSS is defined as the difference 
between EWMAi and EWMAj, where i>j≧0, as shown in Eq. 
(7).

The MRSS in Eq. (7) can be rewritten into Eq. (9), where 
k=i-j, k≧x≧0, σk=(1-α)×α, EWMAj is the EWMA value that 
is k hops before EWMAi, and γ=(1-α)
k 
represents the 
contribution of EWMAj on the value of EWMAi. In order to 
make MRSS sensitive to motion state, it is desirable to make k 
large enough, so that γ is close to zero. Table 1 shows the 
relationship between the choices of α and k if we want γ to be 
smaller than or equal to 0.005. For instance, if α is 0.8 then k 
must be at least 4 to make γ smaller than or equal to 0.005. 
 
Given α we can compute k as that in Table 1, and then 
apply the smoothing function, EWMA, the low pass filter LK, 
on k ARSSes for smoothing as shown in Fig.5. On the other 
hand, the high-pass filter H in the MRSS model calculates the 
difference between two EWMA values that are k hops away as 
shown in Eq. (7).

RSS from RSU and then applies MRSD to obtain the speed 
level of the vehicle. After the vehicle knows its speed level, it 
exchanges that information with other vehicles to update a 
line-graph, and gains the initial cluster information 
{ , , , , }ri g h r N at the same time. The initial information 
{ , , , , }ri g h r N  includes a random assigned node id i by the 
RSU, an initial group id g, which must be 1, an initial cluster 
head id h, which is the same as the randomly assigned id, the 
speed level r detected by MRSD, and the initial number of 
vehicles Nr with speed level r, which is 1. For instance the 
initial cluster information {23,1,23,3,1} indicates that the node 
id is 23, initial group id 1, cluster id 23, speed level 3 and the 
initial speed level 1. As time passes, a vehicle updates its 
cluster information as more messages are received from other 
vehicles and eventually all vehicles in the same cluster will 
have a consistent view on the cluster. 
B. Motion-aware Clustering Algorithm 
 
The main idea of our clustering scheme is to choose a 
node in the biggest group of a speed level while near the 
middle of the cluster as the cluster-head. Intuitively, such a 
node should be able to stay in the cluster for the longest time. 
Thus this scheme can make a cluster stable. 
 
In order to know which node is close to the middle of a 
cluster without GPS, we need to know the relative positions 
among vehicles. In our scheme, a novel line graph is set up in 
each cluster to assist the election of a cluster head. We map 
vehicles in the order of their positions along a road to a line 
graph, in which a node has a maximal degree of two.  
 
The following steps are the procedures when a node 
initiates the cluster algorithm over VANET. 
Step 1. Get node ID and timestamp from RSU. 
Step 2. Apply MRSD to get speed levels by referring to 
the RSS samples from RSU. Exchange 
position table to the cluster and initialize its 
position table. 
Step 3. Initialize and broadcast the local cluster 
information table. 
    Step 4. Upon receiving cluster information tables from 
neighbors; Join/Merge: if the number of 
vehicles between itself and another cluster head 
is less than cL , as shown in Fig. 9, where cL is 
the minimal number of vehicles between two 
cluster heads, then the smaller cluster changes 
its cluster head and join the new cluster ahead. 
If two clusters have the same size, one of them 
is randomly selected to be merged. cL can be 
half of the cluster size of the smaller cluster. 
Step 5. Re-elect cluster head locally based on its 
position table.

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
A. Effect of MRSD Model 
In this section, the effect of the MRSD model is 
presented. The MRSS and MACD are used by deploying 
nodes moving with various speeds in a WLAN first and then 
train the MRSD model. The ANNs model uses 2 hidden layers 
which have 7 and 10 neurons respectively. More than 5000 
data samples are used to train the MRSD model by using the 
NeuroSolution software. Table 2 and Table 3 show that the 
accuracy of speed level and motion detection by using the 
MRSD model. The testing result illustrates the MSE (Mean 
Squared Error) of the MRSD model at: (a) Speed degree level: 
0.0699 (b) Motion aware: 0.0033. It demonstrates that the 
MRSD is very accurate in speed classification and speed 
detection. 
B. Performance Evaluation of Clustering Algorithm Over 
VANETs 
This section presents the performance evaluation of 
clustering algorithm over VANET. The simulation compares 
the proposed solution with two well-known clustering 
algorithms - lowest ID and position-based. Simulation results 
are summarized in Fig.10 and Fig.11. Figure 10 and 11 
illustrates that the election times of MRSD with 4 speed levels
