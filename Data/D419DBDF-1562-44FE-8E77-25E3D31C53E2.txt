Final Report: Behavior-based Intrusion Detection Mechanism Adapted
from Agent-based Dendritic Cell Algorithm
Abstract
Agent-based artificial immune system (ABAIS) is adopted to intrusion detection system (IDS). An agent-
based IDS (ABIDS) inspired by the danger theory of human immune system is proposed. The intelligence
behind ABIDS is based on the danger theory and the functionalities of dendritic cells in human immune
systems, while dentritic cells agents (DC agent) are emulated for innate immune subsystem and artificial
T-cell agents (TC agent) are for adaptive immune subsystem. Antigens are profiles of system calls while
corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agents
for signals and TC agents for antigens, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value
(DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune
response to malicious behaviours is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC).
1. Introduction
Most solutions for information security are static, which collect, analyse and extract evidences after
attacks. These methods have a common disadvantage, namely, they lack of the abilities of self-learning and
self-adapting. Therefore they cannot effectively prevent unknown attacks. Meanwhile, Artificial Immune
System (AIS) is realized as a new research focus of biologically inspired computational approach which can
help determine whether a unknown behavior is normal or nor. However, AIS based on clonal selection
theory, negative selection theory and danger theory cannot describe mechanism of components coordination
for task implementation, which is important for real-world system deployment. Therefore, agent-based AIS
(ABAIS) is a natural solution for such consideration, in particular for computer security. King et al. proposed
intelligent agents utilizing AIS mechanism [1]. Chen proposed network damage detection mechanism based
on ABAIS [2]. For varied ABAISs, [3] provides a detailed review.
Owing to the similarities between AIS and intrusion detection system (IDS), it is quite natural to adopt
the AIS mechanism to IDS for improving the intelligence of the latter. Forrest et al. [4] proposed an instance
of computer immunology to protect the computer systems utilizing principles of human immune systems.
Spafford and Zamboni [5] proposed the first agent-based intrusion detection system. Yang et al. [6] also
proposed agent-based model for IDS based on AIS. Aickelin et al. provides a good survey of AIS-based IDS
[7]. Most AIS researches focus on the development of specialized AIS algorithms inspired by theories such as
the negative selection theory or the danger theory (DT). Matzinger [8] proposed the DT, which has become
more popular among immunologists in recent years for the development of peripheral tolerance (tolerance
to agents outside of the host).
DT states that the immune system will only respond when damage of cells is indicated; immune response
will be actively suppressed otherwise. DT is becoming an efficient way to solve problem such as classification
[9], and anomaly detection [10]. Applying danger theory paradigm to IDS can be traced back to [11].
From implementation viewpoints, the most successful algorithm to fulfill DT is by dendritic cell algorithm.
Greensmith et al. [12] employed artificial dendritic cells (DCs) within AIS which coordinate artificial T-cell
immune responses. Kim et al. [13] proposed ”CARDINAL” which embedded T-cell process within the
danger-theory-based AIS. Gu et al. [14] proposed an architecture of combining multiagent systems and
dendritic cells. Greensmith et al. [10, 12] proposed the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) whose purpose
is to correlate data in the form of antigens and signals, then to identify groups of antigens as normal or
anomalous. DCA accomplishes such a mission through a generation of an anomaly coefficient, namely,mature
2.2. Artificial Immune System (AIS)
Artificial Immune System (AIS) can be regarded as collections of algorithms which are abstracted from
natural immune system such as HIS. AISs have been applied to anomaly detections [14, 11, 13, 16, 17].
They have been developed according to the negative selection algorithm and the clonal selection algorithm
which are based on the classical self-nonself theory; nonselfs are entities which are not part of human
organisms. This so-called self-nonself classification theory had been challenged while failing to explain
several immunological phenomena. Some alternative theories have been proposed, for example, the danger
theory.
2.3. Danger Theory (DT)
DT postulates that the human immune systems respond to the presence of molecules known as danger
signals, which are released as results of unnatural cell deaths. Immune system will only respond when
damage is indicated and is actively suppressed otherwise. DT proposes that APCs, (in particular, DCs),
have danger signal receptors (DSR) which recognize signals sent out by distressed or damaged cells. These
signals inform the immune systems to initiate immune responses. APCs are activated via the danger signals;
these activated APCs will be able to provide necessary signals to the T-cells (more precisely, helper T-cells)
which control the adaptive immune response.
Danger signals are generated by ordinary cells of the body that have been injured due to attacks by
pathogens. These signals are detected by DCs which have three modes of operation: immature, semi-
mature and mature. In the DC’s immature state, it collects antigens along with safe and danger signals
from its local environment. DC is able to integrate these signals to decide whether the environment is safe
or dangerous. If it is safe, DC becomes semi-mature. Upon presenting antigens to T-cells, DC will cause
T-cells tolerance. If it is dangerous, DC becomes mature and causes the T-cells to become reactive on
antigen-presentations.
2.4. Agent-based Artificial Immune Systems (ABAIS)
Agent is an entity or any piece of software that has the ability of consciousness, solving problem, self-
learning and adapting to the environment. In general, it can make decisions autonomously on the behalf of
users [3]. It is very similar to immunological cells in functionalities.
Adoption of MAS to AIS is a way to provide the coordination and communication mechanisms to the
latter. According to [3], those mechanisms are insufficient for non-agent-based AIS. On the other hand,
adaptability of AIS can be contributed to the learning mechanism of agents. Immune system response
attributes such as specificity, diversity, memory and self/non-self recognition, are needed for decent learning
mechanism. It may be used to optimize the agent’s responses to intruders. Functionalities of the biological
immune system, such as content addressable memory, adaptation, etc., can be utilized in intelligent agents.
Adaptability is both a challenge and an important feature for MASs to interact with the environ-
ment. Three major stages for ABAIS inspired by the clonal selection theory are diversity generation,
self-maintenance and memory of nonself [18]. The last two properties define the adaptability of MASs.
Diversity Generation (Continuous) diversity generation leads to the ”adaptability” of ABAIS. Diverse
agents with distinct specificity of the receptor and the effector are generated by way of mutations.
Self-Maintenance Agents are adjusted to be insensitive to known patterns (self) during the developmental
phase. Negative selection theory is a central of this phase.
Memory of Nonself Agents are adjusted to be more sensitive to unknown patterns (nonself) during the
working phase.
Table 1 shows some comparisons between AIS and MAS. AIS, which is abstracted from human immune
system, is also inherited those properties from the latter such as diversity generation, self tolerance, learning,
coordination, self maintenance and memory. On the other hand, there are several properties that a generic

3.2. Antigen
For most network detecting systems (for example, those adopting self-nonself paradigm for immune
systems), an antigen is defined as an information vector extracted from network packets. For example,
antigens are binary strings extracted from the IP packets, which include IP address, port number, protocol
types, etc. However, the antigen defined in ABIDS is related to system calls rather than network packets.
A system call is the way how a program requests a service from an operating system’s kernel; it provides
an interface between a process and the operating system. Each process invokes some system calls. The
more active the process, the more system calls it makes. Each system call is captured and converted into
an antigen [19]. Process identification numbers (PID) can be utilized to form antigens which are generated
each time a system call is involved [12]
3.3. Intelligent Agents in AIS
We design a MAS with antigen agents, DC agents, T-Cell agents and Responding agents to perform
functionalities of ABIDS such as Dendritic Cell Algorithm (Table 2).
Table 2: Agents, Goals and Services.
Agent Goals Services
Ag Agent Data Parsing antigen label and signal associa-
tion
DC Agent Detect malicious codes or network
attacks at the input sources
MCAV estimation, update activa-
tion threshold
TC Agent Categorize nonself antigen Identify the malicious antigen
RP Agent Reduce the malicious antigen Implement the system response
3.3.1. Antigen Agent (Ag Agent)
Antigen agents, which are installed at computer hosts, represent data item from some dataset. They
extract and record selected attributes from these data items. According to the agent-based DCA (ABDCA)
which will be described later, each Ag agent sends corresponding DC agent a picked message when a nonself
antigen appears.
3.3.2. Dendritic Cell agent (DC agent)
In order to determine whether a malicious behavior is taking place, ABIDS needs to analyze antigens.
DC agents are the kernel of the ABAIS which are complex compared to other agents; they are installed
and distributed at each computer hosts. When an Ag agent issues a picked signal, corresponding DC agent
will evaluate the risk state facing by the host by calculating the danger value (DV). Similar to nature DC,
each DC agent has three stages, namely immature, semimature and mature. DC agents are started from
immature stages. When a picked signal is issued from an Ag agent, DC agent executes data processing
function such as the ABDCA. When a DC agent is at either semimature or nature state, it returns the
mature context to corresponding TC agent.
3.3.3. T-cell agent (TC Agent)
TC agents are also installed at each computer hosts. They are activated by the signals from DC agents
when the DVs exceed some threshold values. Each TC agent has three numerical values associated with those
thresholds; they represent the accumulated certainties and severities of attacks: T-cell activation threshold,
Th1 activation threshold, Th2 activation threshold. These TC agents will communicate with each other to
update these threshold values. There are two conditions for such agent communications.
• If TC agent issues warning signal of malicious act for this antigen, then it also informs TC agents
”nearby” by exchanging its (three) threshold values.
• If TC agent does not issue warning signal of malicious act for this antigen, then it simply updates its
threshold values according to ”nearby” TC agents which have issued warning signals.

usage (cpuu), memory load (meml), network connection (netc) and bandwidth saturation (bands), are shown
as follows. The idea is the following: network information plays the role of costimulation signal described
in the danger theory.
1. PAMP Signal: (netc > Thnetc) AND (bands > Thbands).
2. Danger Signal: (cpuu > Thcpuu) OR (meml > Thmeml).
3. Safe Signal: All parameters < Thparameter.
Where Thparameter represents the threshold value of the parameter. Now the computation of output
signals by three temporary output values is the following.
output signal =
WP · CP +WD · CD +WS · CS
WP +WD +WS
(2)
According to some empirical experiments [12], the weights for this output signal can be chosen asWP = 2,
WD = 1, WS = 1. CP , CD, CS represent PAMP signal, danger signal and safe signal, respectively. The
principle for setting these weights is the following: PAMP signal will decide whether the danger signal will
be a ”really” harmful one. Whether output signal is harmful or nor is defined by the Table 3.
Table 3: Definitions of Output Signal.
Output Signal CP CD CS
Normality 0 0 1
Harmless Abnormality 0 1 0
Harm Abnormality 1 1 0
3.5. Algorithm: Agent-based IDS (ABIDS)
Now according to the ABDCA, we propose an algorithm describing agent-based IDS. This algorithm is
also illustrated diagrammatically as Figure 1. ABDCA can determine, not only a network packet but also a
group of network packets, is anomalous or not. This is achieved by the generation of an anomaly coefficient
value, namely MCAV.
For the step 4 of the Algorithm 2, each nonself antigen gets a binary string of mature contexts from
every selected DC agent installed at corresponding computer host. MCAV can be calculated through the
number of context ”1” divided by the number of all contexts. According to [14], it is similar to a voting
system, where the antigen is a candidate and DC agents are voters. If the context is ”1” (”0”), it means
the DC agent determines this antigen is malicious (benign). The MCAV is actually the probability of this
antigen to be malicious determined by a group of DC agents.
Reactions of RP agents can be multiple according to the SOC’s security policies. For example, a passive
reaction is initiated while some RP agent sends an alarm signal, such as an e-mail, to the administrator. On
the other hand, a proactive strategy can be defined through mobile agents that implement the characteristics
of security reactions. According to [20], for example, an applied reaction is defined for each of the following
internet protocol such as DNS, FTP, HTTP, POP3 and SMTP. However, the issue of RP agents is out of
the scope in this paper.
4. Experimental Evaluations
Owing to lack of real data so far, we perform some experimental evaluations for this ABIDS. First we
perform the critical tests for ABDCA. Then we evaluate the coordination between TC agents.

Algorithm 2 Agent-based IDS (ABIDS)
Initialization: Some network packets are suspicious as malicious.
Input: Antigen-Signal pair
Output: Antigen Type
1. Data Processing:
1.1 Ag agent extracts an antigen from Antigen-Signal pair.
2. Agent response:
2.1 DC agent returns its context value according to ABDCA; also according to the policy of the SOC if
necessary.
2.2 DC agent responds to this antigen by updating its state according to ABDCA.
3. Danger Signal processing:
3.1
if this DC agent returns mature value to Ag agent then
Ag agent transfers it to the TC agent.
end if
3.2 TC agent categorizes such antigen according to the threat profile.
4. MCAV generation:
4.1 TC agent generates MCAV, which is sent to the RP agent.
4.2 RP agent determines if the corresponding antigen is malicious or not.
4.1.3. Host Behaviour with Short Attacking Time
In this evaluation, computer host I behaves with both high severity and certainty, but relative medium
attacking time. It is also difficult to determine if this is a malicious attack or not. In this case, we consider
TP (I) = [0.9, 0.9, 0.4]. Therefore I is facing a 0.8-intrusion.
Evaluation shows a stable result (see Figure 4); average MCAV is around 0.5, which indicates that this
nonself antigen can be harmfully or harmful abnormal depending on the SOC’s security profile.
4.2. Evaluations of ABIDS with TC Agents’ Coordination
We evaluate the ABIDS by monitoring system calls directly. First we illustrate the dynamics of activation
threshold induced by coordination among three TC agents.
4.2.1. Interactions among Three TC Agents
We consider three computer hosts with TC agents, says TC1, TC2 and TC3 respectively. They are
informing each other for attack confirmation from some nonself antigens. Each T-cell informs the other two
that its host is in danger; these T-cells increase their activation thresholds between time 20 and 100. In
particular, the signal indicating system behaviours reaches its peak around time lequal to 60. After time
100, these threshold values are stable, see Figure 5.
4.2.2. Evaluation of ABIDS with Suspicious System calls
We also evaluate the ABIDS by considering the following system behaviours as illustrated in Figure 6.
System call is represented by the signal attribute (0.5639, 0.4001, 0.2992, 0.9431), which shows CPU usage
and bandwidth saturation (first and third components) are in suspicious modes.
The evaluation shows a stable result (see Figure 7); average MCAV is equal to 1, which indicates that
this system behaviour caused by some nonself antigens is harmfully abnormal.

Comments to the authors:
   I can't comment on the details of this paper, but it seems to be well outside
   the scope of CEC (even artificial immune systems and bioinformatics).  This is
   about models of real immune systems/networks - it would be well-suited to a
   theoretical biology audience.  I don't think it is relevant to many CEC attendees.
Jerne’s theory implicitly retains the concepts of network
stability, which can be modeled through the nonlinear dy-
namical systems [8]. For more mathematical description of
immune network theory, see [9]. However, lots of efforts are
trying to faithfully express Jerne’s idea. One philosophy is
to reconsider the real immune system and clarify the roles
of the lymphocyte and the antibody in the regulation through
the nonlinear dynamical systems. Immune memory mechanism
will be explained through this nonlinear dynamical system.
The formation of immune memory is related to concentration
levels of various immune cells during the primary immune and
secondary immune responses. This concepts is the major idea
throughout this paper. The existence of the immune memory
implies then the stabilizing of the new steady state. The
stability is a requirement of the homeostasis of the biological
system. Mathematical models are used to identify the evolution
of immunological memory [10]. Ahmed proposed a model of
immune memory with competitive dynamical systems [11].
It is a controversial issue on the role of antigen for main-
tenance of immune memory Two contrasting theories are as
follows. For the first theory, immune memory is dynamically
maintained by continuous antigenic stimulation to the antigen-
specific lymphocyte. On the other hand, immune memory is
presented by immune memory cells in some resting state.
Harada has advocated the first theory by simulation results
[12]. In this paper, we will show the immune memory mecha-
nism is associative by combining these two theories based on
the stability of dynamical systems theory.
The major goal of this paper is to study the memory
mechanism based on nonlinear dynamical system of idiotypic
immune network architecture proposed by [8]. In particular,
we will construct an associative memory mechanism by way
of some chaotic attractor inspired by [13]. We consider lym-
phocyte concentration in addition to antibody concentration for
memory mechanism. Antigens bind populations of antibodies,
which control the immune response and produce actions of
differentiation and regulation. This network structure will
proved to be major contributions to the immune memory
mechanism.
The arrangement of this paper is as follows. In section
2, some preliminary knowledge of immune memory is intro-
duced. In section 3, dynamical behavior of idiotypic immune
network is described. Stability analysis of immune network is
given in section 4.
II. PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE
Modeling an immune system is a major challenge for
researchers. According to experimental findings, some the-
oretical considerations may help researchers select suitable
set of interactions using mathematical knowledge. Firstly, it
is well-known that immune system, if regarded as a net-
work, is stable or quasi-stable [3][14]. Therefore, equations
describing dynamics of immune network must have stable
solutions. Furthermore, the mathematical simulation of im-
mune behavior must predict the ’switching’ among states
according to observed data. Based on Jerne’s immune network
theory, lymphocyte cells are communicating one another. The
formation of such immune network systems is based on the
following considerations: interactions between B-cells and T-
cells (such as T-helper (𝑇𝐻 ) cells and T-suppression (𝑇𝑆)
cells); interactions between Lymphocyte units which including
antibody’s communications.
A. Lymphocyte Unit
The immune system consists of the antibodies and lympho-
cytes, which include T cells and B-cells. The human immune
system uses a large number of highly specific B- and T-cells
to recognize antigens. Only B-cells secrete antibodies. Clonal
selection theory explained the details of antibody secretion
specific to an antigen where T-cells help regulating. The
binding between antigen and specific lymphocytes trigger
proliferation from immature lymphocytes to mature one and
the secretion of antibodies. Antigen binds to receptors of
the specific immature lymphocyte. The specific immature
lymphocyte is selected by some antigen. Such binding triggers
proliferations from both the T-cell and B-cell lymphocytes.
B. Idiotypic Immune Network
Idiotypic network theory implies that cells co-stimulate
each other in a way that mimics the presence of the antigen
[15]. Antibody and receptor of the lymphocytes can recognize
each other. The epitope of antibody molecule is called an
”idiotope”. An epitope of antigen 𝐴𝑔 is recognized by the
antibody molecule 𝐴𝑏1 and by the receptor molecule on the
lymphocyte of 𝐿𝑈1. The antibody 𝐴𝑏1 and the receptor of
𝐿𝑈1 have the idiotope which is recognized by antibody 𝐴𝑏2
and the receptor on the lymphocyte of 𝐿𝑈2. On the other hand,
the antibody 𝐴𝑏1 and the receptor on the lymphocyte of 𝐿𝑈1
also recognize idiotopes on antibody 𝐴𝑏𝑛. 𝐴𝑏𝑛 constitutes
an internal image of the antigen 𝐴𝑔 . Network forming by
interactions between lymphocyte interactions. This 𝐴𝑏𝑛 con-
stitutes an internal image of the antigen 𝐴𝑔, see Figure 1. The
idiotypic network theory has been proposed as a central aspect
of the associative properties of immune memory [15][16].
C. Dynamics of Immune Network caused by Antigenic Inva-
sion
An Immune network can be regarded as a closed network
it there exists some cyclic subnetwork. In this paper, we are
particularly interested in such closed immune network with
connectivity matrix 𝑀 . The connectivity of the ith antibody
is defined as the number of antibodies with nonzero 𝑀𝑖,𝑗 . This
matrix is the indicator for the concentration of any antibody
depends on the concentrations of all other antibodies.
In general, the population dynamics of each lymphocyte
clone can be described as the following dynamical system [12].
𝑋 ′ = −𝛼𝑋𝐼𝐴+ 𝛽𝑋𝐴+ 𝛾𝑋 − 𝑑𝑋 (1)
However, this system only concerns the immune response of
lymphocyte 𝑋 with respect to antigen injections. For immune
network theory, different lymphocytes such as B-cells, T-
helper cell ans T-Killer cells, are also concerned. Therefore,
Fig. 2. Cyclic Immune Network.
The ground state can be defined as some initial state for
immune memory.
There are various mathematical models describing the in-
teractions of lymphocytes. For example, Stewart and Varela
[23]. The existence of suppressed states could account for the
immune tolerance. According to Sonoda [8], equations of the
interaction of the lymphocytes can be described as
𝑑𝐻

𝐻 , 𝑆 and 𝐴 are variables representing the concentrations of
𝑇𝐻 cells, 𝑇𝑆 cells and antigens respectively. The coefficients
𝑎𝑋𝑌 represents the strength of the action of the Y cell to X
cell. 𝜈𝑋 represents the concentration of immature-X cell. 𝑑𝑋
represents the decay rate of X cell. Φ is a nonlinear function.
According to Glass and Kaufman, it can be a sigmiods of the
form Φ(𝑥, 𝑡, 𝑛) = 𝑥
𝑛
𝑡𝑛+𝑥𝑛 . 𝜈𝑋Φ(𝐴, 𝑡𝜈𝑋 , 𝑛𝜈𝑋) represent that
an immature-lymphocyte is stimulated by antigens so as to
proliferate to mature lymphocytes by the clonal selection
theory. The antibody concentration 𝐵 satisfies the following
equation:
𝑑𝐵
𝑑𝑡
= 𝜈𝐵Φ(𝐴, 𝑡𝜈𝐵 , 𝑛𝜈𝐵)− 𝑑𝐵𝐵 (4)
Equations (2)-(4) are called the BHS model which describes
the dynamics within LUs.
Fig. 3. Formation of the Memory State in the Cyclic Immune network
(𝑁 = 7). For example, the arrow from 𝐿𝑈1 to 𝐿𝑈2 represents 𝑚12 ∕= 0.
B. Dynamics between Lymphocyte Units: Cyclic Idiotypic
Network
BHS model is complex due to the numbers of LUs. How-
ever, this model can be greatly simplified by considering
cyclic idiotypic networks, which can contribute to the immune
memory mechanism. BHS model has its disadvantages. For
example, it does not consider the interactions between antibod-
ies and B-cells. Evidences show that idiotypic/anti-idiotypic
interactions among antibodies and B-cells influence on shaping
B-cells and T-cells repertoire in the newborn immune system
[24].
Farmer et al. [16] introduce the matching coefficient 𝑚𝑖𝑗
to represent the strength of a matching between an epitope of
i-th antibody and an idiotope of j-th antibody. 𝑚𝑖𝑗 can also
be used for a matching between an epitope of i-th antibody
and a paratope of j-th antigen. Now we concentrate on the
dynamics of immune system based on cyclic idiotypic network
⟨{𝐿𝑈𝑖}𝑁𝑖=1,𝑀⟩.
C. Immune Memory Described by Cyclic Idiotypic Network
The immune memory can be formed and preserved by a
cyclic loop within the idiotypic network (Figure 3). When an
antigen is injected into the immune system, antibody stimu-
lation propagates in 𝐿𝑈𝑖 successively. For all LUs forming a
closed loop in the network, these active states are preserved
and a memory state is asymptotically formed. Memory state
is defined as an equilibrium state for dynamical systems of
(2)-(3).
For 𝑇𝐻 cell and 𝑇𝑆 cell, it is suggested that both the
clonal selection term and the decay term can be neglected [8].
Therefore, (2)-(3) can be deduced to the following equations
for the active state.
C. Simulations
We simulate the dynamics of (9) with 𝑁 = 3 where each
lymphocyte unit is at high active state. For this 3-cycle immune
network, this simulation shows the second immune response
of the same antigen is more rapidly than the first response, as
the antibodies 𝐴𝑏2 and 𝐴𝑏3 generated in the second immune
response are around 1.5 and 3 times than those in the first
immune response. These antibodies become stable again soon
after the second immune response ends (Figure 5). On the
other hand, each 𝐴𝑏𝑖 is approximately closed to its stable state
(Figure 6).

V. CONCLUSIONS
We propose several dynamical systems of immune response
mechanism based on the cyclic idiotypic network, namely, HS
model, BHS model and Antibody-Antigen equation. Accord-
ing to the stability of each lymphocyte unit, the formation of
immune memory can be deduced by close loop of the cell’s
interactions. Immune Memory mechanism can be interpreted
by these models within active states.
