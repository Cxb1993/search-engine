Abstract 
This study investigated the characteristics of polybrominated diphenyl ethers 
(PBDEs) and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) in the 
stack flue gases of metallurgical facilities. The mean PBDD/F TEQ concentrations (7 
congeners) in the stack flue gases of the electric arc furnaces (EAFs), ferrous 
foundries, fly ash treatment plant and sinter plants were 5.23, 1.47, 0.950 and 1.90 pg 
TEQ/Nm3, respectively, while the PBDE concentrations (30 congeners) were 25.6, 
36.7, 20.9 and 41.8 ng/Nm3, respectively. PBDEs existing in the stack flue gases of 
sinter plants revealed that PBDEs can form during the combustion process. The 
emission factors of PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs of the fly ash treatment plant 
were all highest among these metallurgical facilities, while those of sinter plants were 
all lowest, showing that the feeding materials is influential factor affecting PBDE and 
PBDD/F emissions of metallurgical facilities. BDE-209 is the most abundant PBDE 
congeners in the emissions of metallurgical facilities, and also had been found 
dominant in different environmental media. However, few study considered 
metallurgical facilities or other combustion emission as potential PBDE sources to the 
environment. Owing to that PBDEs could form or not be completely destroyed in the 
feeding materials in the combustion system, PBDE contributions from stack flue

Introduction 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are extensively used as brominated 
flame retardants (BFRs) in many articles for daily use. Due to health risks, the 
commercial Penta-BDE and Octa-BDE mixtures had been banned within the 
European Union in 2004, and Deca-BDE is the only remaining PBDEs exempted 
from regulation. PBDEs having high octanol-water partition coefficients (KOW) and 
high octanol-air partition coefficient (KOA) can biomagnify in water-respiring and 
air-breathing organisms [1]. Consequently, PBDEs are not only ubiquitous in the 
environment [2-5], but also highly accumulated in top predator, like polar bear [6], 
dolphins [7] and birds of prey [8] 
Concerns about polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) 
increased with the more and more extensive use of BFRs, because PBDEs are 
significant PBDD/F precursors during thermal processes [9]. Our previous work also 
found that the PBDD/F concentrations (18.2 pg/Nm3, 4.17 pg TEQ/Nm3) of the 
industrial waste incinerators (IWIs) with higher bromine contents in the feeding waste 
were eight times higher than that of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) (2.28 
pg/Nm3, 0.557 pg TEQ/Nm3), however, their PCDD/F concentrations are in the same 
range [10].

This study investigated the PBDE and 2,3,7,8-substituted PBDD/F characteristics 
in the stack flue gases of metallurgical facilities, including electric arc furnaces 
(EAFs), ferrous foundries, fly ash treatment plant, and sinter plants. The 
concentrations, emission factors and congener profiles of PBDEs and PBDD/Fs of 
these metallurgical facilities are presented. Furthermore, by comparing PBDEs, 
PBDD/Fs and PCDD/Fs with each other, the relationship between these structurally 
similar compounds in the stack flue gases of metallurgical facilities are discussed. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Basic information concerning the metallurgical facilities. The basic and 
operational information of these metallurgical facilities is described in Table 1. These 
EAFs can further be classified as carbon steel and stainless steel EAFs according to 
the final products. The carbon content in stainless steel is less than 0.15%, while that 
in carbon steel is between 0.25% ~ 1.4% [20]. Sinter plants are also classified to two 
subcategories according to their APCDs with or without selective catalytic reduction 
(SCR) [21].  
The EAF fly ash treatment plant was established to recover the remained iron 
from EAF fly ashes (chlorine content: 5%), which were pelleted with flux and fine 
10 
 
detection limit. That is, one facility had data for three PCDD/F, one PBDD/F and one 
PBDE stack flue gas samples.  
Compared to PCDD/Fs, which had 17 congeners reported, only 7 of the possible 
17 2,3,7,8-substituted PBDD/F congeners were reported due to the lack of a standard. 
As for PBDEs, the samples were analyzed for 30 PBDE congeners. Analytical 
procedures of PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs in detail are given in the SI and our previous 
work [19, 22], while PBDE analyses are as follows. PBDE standard in a nonane 
solution was purchased from Wellington Laboratories (Ontario, Canada), including 
Precision and Recovery (PAR) stock solution (30 congeners: BDE-7, -15, -17, -28, 
-49, -71, -47, -66, -77, -100, -119, -99, -85, -126, -154, -153, -139, -140, -138, -156, 
-184, -183, -191, -197, -203, -196, -207, -206, -208 and -209), labeled internal 
standard solution (10 congeners: 13C12 BDE-15, -28,-47, -99, -154, -153, -183, -197, 
-207, and -209), and recovery standard solution (one congener: 13C12 BDE-138).  
PBDE analyses followed the U.S. EPA Method 1614. The PBDE internal standards 
were spiked to the samples before Soxhlet extraction, and were used to monitor the 
extraction and cleanup procedures.  
After extraction, treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid was used for the first 
cleanup. For the next cleanup procedure, a multi-layered silica column was used, 
which was packed sequentially with a plug of glass wool, 0.3 mL activated silica gel, 
12 
 
film thickness = 0.25 μm) (J&W Scientific, CA). The oven temperature was 
programmed with an initial temperature of 150 °C (held for 1 min), then an 
incremental increase of 30 °C/min to 220 °C (held for 12 min), before reaching 240 
°C (held for 5 min), and 310 °C (held for 20 min) at a rate of 1.5 °C/min.  For 
PBDEs, following a splitless injection (injector at 250 °C, transfer glass line at 280 °C) 
using helium as the carrier gas (at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min), a DB-5HT capillary 
column (L = 15 m, i.d. = 0.25 mm, film thickness = 0.1 μm) (J&W Scientific, CA) 
was employed undergoing a temperature program, which began at 100 °C (held for 4 
min), then increased at 40 °C/min to 200 °C (held for 3.5 min), and finally increased 
at 10 °C/min to 325 °C (held for 2.5 min).  
The HRMS (Micromass Autospec Ultima, Manchester, UK) was equipped with a 
positive electron impact (EI+) source. The analyzer mode of the selected ion 
monitoring (SIM) was used with a resolving power of 10000. The electron energy and 
source temperature were specified at 35 eV and 250 °C, respectively.

flue gases were 5.23 (range: 0.250-25.6, RSD: 191%), 1.47 (range: 1.25-1.68, RSD: 
20.9%), 0.950 (range: 0.682-1.22, RSD: 39.9%) and 1.90 pg TEQ/Nm3 (range: 
0.596-3.09 pg TEQ/Nm3, RSD: 50.3%), respectively. Comparing to our previous 
work on MSWIs (2.28 pg/Nm3, 0.557 pg TEQ/Nm3) and IWIs (18.2 pg/Nm3, 4.17 pg 
TEQ/Nm3) [10], the PBDD/F concentrations in the stack flue gases of the EAFs were 
comparable to that of IWIs, while the PBDD/F concentrations of the other 
metallurgical facilities were lower than that of IWIs, but higher than that of MSWIs.  
The mean total PBDE concentrations (30 congeners) in the stack flue gases of the 
EAFs, ferrous foundries, fly ash treatment plant and sinter plants were 25.6 (range: 
5.80-91.8, RSD: 128%), 36.7 (range: 32.1-41.3, RSD: 17.7%), 20.9 (range: 7.08-34.7, 
RSD: 93.5%), and 41.8 ng/Nm3 (range: 12.8-70.6 pg/Nm3, RSD: 58.3%), respectively. 
Surprisingly, PBDEs also exists in the stack flue gases of sinter plants, which 
feedstock contained coke, lime and iron ore, but no any BFRs-contained wastes, 
revealing that PBDEs can form during the combustion process.  
 
Emission factors of PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs. Tables 4 and 5 list the mean 
emission factors of PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs from the stack gases of EAFs, 
ferrous foundries and fly ash treatment plant, sinter plants, respectively. The emission 
factors are calculated based on product production. The PCDD/F emission factors 
16 
 
stainless steel EAFs. The ratios of emission factors of carbon steel EAFs to stainless 
steel EAFs based on AM are 3.40 - 7.79 on mass basis, and 4.56 - 8.07 on toxicity 
basis (for PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs), respectively. This might because the production 
of stainless steel requires scrap with less impurity and contamination than the 
production of carbon steel. 
The emission factors of PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs of the fly ash treatment 
plant were all highest among these metallurgical facilities, while those of sinter plants 
were all lowest. The high chlorine (bromine) and PCDD/F (PBDD/F) content in the 
EAF fly ashes comparing to the feeding scraps of EAFs may be the reason that 
PCDD/F and PBDD/F emission factors of the fly ash treatment plant were higher than 
that of EAFs. Similarly, the higher PBDE emission factor of the fly ash treatment 
plant than that of EAFs may be attributed to higher PBDE contents in the EAF fly 
ashes, which resulted from PBDEs not destroyed or formed during combustion 
process of EAFs. Furthermore, the PBDE contents in the EAF fly ashes may also be 
one of the reasons that the fly ash treatment plant exhibited higher PBDD/F emission 
factors. Based on the above results, the bromine content and PBDE and PBDD/F 
content in the feeding materials are influential factors affecting PBDE and PBDD/F 
emissions of metallurgical facilities.  
Removal characteristics of PBDEs, PBDD/Fs and PCDD/Fs by SCR. 
18 
 
If we compared PBDD/Fs to their chlorinated analogues, the removal efficiencies of 
PBDD/Fs (64.2% - 62.4%) were higher than that of PCDD/Fs (43.0% - 53.6%). This 
is due to the weaker binding energy of C-Br than that of C-Cl [9]. 
 
Congener profiles of PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs. PCDD/F, PBDD/F and 
PBDE congener profiles in the stack flue gases of these metallurgical facilities were 
illustrated in Figures 1 to 3, respectively. The PCDD/F congener profiles obtained 
from these metallurgical facilities are comparable to the results of our previous work 
[20, 21, 29] and other studies [24, 30]. 2,3,7,8-TeCDF, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF, and 
2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, are more prominent congeners in the stack flue gases of 
metallurgical facilities. The fractions of these lower chlorinated PCDF congeners are 
also higher comparing to other sources, such as waste incinerators [10, 29, 31] and 
power plants [23]. Similarly, 2,3,7,8-TeBDF, 1,2,3,7,8-PeBDF and 2,3,4,7,8-PeBDF 
are the most abundant congeners for the metallurgical facilities, and their fractions are 
also higher than those of MSWIs [10]. The comparable distributions of congener 
profiles between PCDD/F and PBDD/F emitting from the different emission sources 
indicate similar substitution mechanisms of bromine and chlorine during formation. 
For PBDEs, the most dominant PBDE congeners in the stack flue gases of the fly 
ash treatment plant and sinter plants are higher brominated-substituted congeners, 
20 
 
from a Swedish study [35] and in terrestrial wildlife [8]. However, few study consider 
metallurgical facilities or other combustion emission as potential PBDE sources to the 
environment because of few understanding of their PBDE emission characteristics. 
Owing to that PBDEs could form or not be completely destroyed in the feeding 
materials in the combustion system, PBDE contributions from combustion emission 
sources to the atmosphere should not be ignored and need further investigation.
