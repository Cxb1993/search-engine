Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of a series of micro/nanostructured polyanilines and the
investigation of their morphology-dependent electrochemical properties for acting as a suitable
catalyst supporter and methanol transport regular for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications.
These micro/nanostructures include submicron spheres, hollow microspheres, nanotubes, and
nanofibers. Experimental results indicate that among the micro/nanostructures, the polyaniline
nanofibers (PANF) with the highest electrochemical active surface are most suitable for DMFC
applications. Accordingly, PANF is adopted as the catalyst supporter and transport regular material
thereafter. Compared with Pt/XC-72, it is found that the Pt/PANF possesses higher electrocatalytic
activity and exhibits double power density. Moreover, Pt/PANF is superior to Pt/XC-72 in the aspect
of operation stability of DMFC based on a continuous discharge for 5 hours. Besides, this study also
finds a novel strategy by using polyaniline nanofibers(PANFs) to modify membrane-electrode
assembly (MEA) for improving direct methanol fuel cell(DMFC) performance. Polarization curves
indicate that the placing a layer of PANFs between CL and GDL can both reduce the methanol
transport resistance and methanol crossover of the MEA. The DMFC incorporated with
H2SO4-doped PANFs obtained performs a power density as high as 53 mW cm-2, about 20% higher
than that of the pristine one without PANFs incorporation. These findings provide a simple and
effective way by using PANFs properly to act as methanol transport regulator in anode and using as
the catalyst supporter to improve the DMFC performance.

4inconsistent conclusion that a lower performance of PtRu/PANI is obtained when compared with
PtRu/C [45].
Besides, several researchers have attempted to reduce methanol crossover in DMFC by
modifying the existing Nafion membrane with a variety of materials, such as calcium phosphate [14],
zirconium phosphate [15], sulfonated organosilica [16], neodymium triflate [17] and polyfurfuryl
alcohol [18]. However, although this treatment efficiently reduces the methanol permeability of
Nafion, proton conductivity decreases noticeably after this treatment. The decreased proton
conductivity leads to a decreased DMFC performance. Therefore, several recent studies have tried to
develop a series of PEM with low methanol permeability and suitable proton conductivity from
polyhydrocarbons [19-20] or perfluorinated materials [21-22]. However, until now, these developed
membranes still face mechanical and stability problems.
Recent studies have tried to modify the structure of membrane electrode assemblies to reduce
methanol crossover in fuel cells. For example, Wang et al. [23] developed a double-layered catalyst
structure in cathode and found that efficiently reduced methanol crossover in fuel cell and enhanced
its performance. Park et al. [24-25] reported adding a micro porous layer (MPL) in diffusion layer is
an effective way to reduce methanol crossover in fuel cell. However, although these structural
adjustments of MEA reportedly decrease methanol crossover in fuel cells, researchers have found
increased mass and electron transport resistance after this adjustment process [24-25]. Accordingly,
researchers have tried to introduce an extra polyaniline layer on PEM to reduce methanol crossover
in fuel cells, taking advantage of the interaction between polyaniline and methanol [26-28].
Nevertheless, they found this treatment might lead an incompatible interface between the catalyst
layer and the PEM [28].
Several researchers have reported that adding carbon nanofibers in gas diffusion layer (GDL) is
effective in reducing electronic and mass transport resistance, as it forms extra electron transport
bridges and larger pores in GDL [29-31]. Other studies observed similar results by adding
polyaniline nanofibers (PANFs) in gas sensor device for reducing electronic and gas transport
resistance [46-47]. Besides, high electron conductivity has been regarded as a prerequisite property
of PANFs for electrochemical device applications [48-49]. These characteristics are helpful for
PANFs in reducing the mass and electronic transport resistance within the electrode.
Accordingly, to clarify the advantage of (1) using adequate nanostructured polyaniline as
catalyst supporter for DMFC applications and (2) to introduce a layer of PANFs in gas diffusion
electrode to serve as methanol transport regulator, this study aims to investigate the electrochemical
properties of polyaniline with different micro-/nano- structures (i.e. submicron spheres, hollow
microspheres, nanofibers, and nanotubes) to determine a most suitable shape of Pt supporter and
methanol transport regulator. Several experimental methods, such as electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy, methanol crossover rate, and single cell performance were used to (1) demonstrate the
benefit of using a PANI nanostructure as a Pt supporter and (2) investigate the effect PANFs
6(99%) in the solution to prepare the PANI- or XC-72-supported Pt catalysts. These mixtures were
stirred at room temperature for 16 hours to reduce the Pt precursors completely. Then, the solution
was isolated using gravity filtration and washed several times with deionized water. For comparison,
a similar reaction was performed by using the K2PtCl4 solution and 2.8 ml of 0.05M NaBH4 as
reduction agent. UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 850, Perkin Elmer, USA) was used to identify
the completion of reaction of K2PtCl4 during the reduction process.
2.4 Electrochemical characterization of PANI, Pt/PANI, and Pt/XC-72
The cyclic voltammetry curve of the resulting polyaniline micro/nanostructures and the Pt catalysts
supported on PANI and XC-72 carbon black were conducted with a three-electrode setup. The
working electrode with a circular area of 1 cm2 was prepared as follows. The PANI
micro/nanostructures, Pt/PANI or Pt/XC-72 were respectively mixed ultrasonically with isopropanol
in a glass vial with a weight ratio of 1:30. Then, a suitable amount of Nafion® solution was added to
the dispersion and mixed until a uniform paste was obtained. The weight ratio of Pt plus catalyst
supporter（i.e. PANI micro/nanostructures, Pt/PANI or Pt/XC-72）to Nafion is 1:1.34. This ink was
then spread on the surface of the gas diffusion media (15% wet proof, HEPHAS energy, Taiwan) and
dried in an oven at 60 ◦C. Ag/AgCl and platinum wire were used as the reference and counter
electrode, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry curves were obtained in a 1M methanol and 0.5 M
H2SO4 solution. The scan range was from −0.2 to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl, and the scan rate was 50
mV s−1.
2.5 Preparation and evaluation of direct methanol fuel cells
To demonstrate the advantage of using nanostructured polyaniline as catalyst supporter for DMFC
application, the anode was fabricated using gas diffusion media as a supporter with a given metal
loading of 3 mg cm−2. The Pt particles were deposited on the PANI nanostructures and XC-72
carbon black to be anode catalyst respectively. The cathode was prepared by using a
carbon-supported Pt catalyst (50% Pt on carbon black - Alfa Aesar, USA) with a metal loading of 3
mg cm−2. The added Nafion® as binder in both anode and cathode is 10 wt%. 2M methanol solutions
were fed at a fixed rate of 3 ml min-1 and the oxygen flow rate was fixed at 100 SCCM. The pressure
at the cathode side is one atmosphere. The fabrication procedures and conditions of the MEA were
set according to the previous literature, using the Nafion® 115 as the proton conducting membrane
[50].
2.6 Preparation of PANFs-incorporated membrane-electrode assemblies
To modify membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) for improving direct methanol fuel cell(DMFC)
performance. Three types of MEA with different layouts were prepared according to the following
methods. (1)A layer of PANFs at a loading amount of 1 mg cm-2 was sandwiched between the proton
exchange membrane(PEM) and the catalyst layer (CL), which consists of carbon supported Pt–Ru
bound with Nafion® electrolyte. (2) An amount of PANFs equivalent to method (1) was mixed with
catalyst slurry and then coated onto the GDL. (3) A layer of PANFs with a loading amount of 1 mg
cm-2 was sandwiched between the CL and the GDL. The metal loading amount of catalyst in anode is
8microspheres in the aspect of current density. This higher current density stands for the higher
effective surface area that is accessible to electrolytes [58]. Moreover, as there is a charge transfer
energy barrier between the PANI micro/nanostructured supporter and the electrode substrate (i.e.
carbon cloth in this case), this higher current density of nanofibers may be attributed to a close surface
contact between the nanofibers and the electrode substrate as well as higher surface active area [41].
These characteristics are favorable for a catalyst supporter to fabricate highly efficient electronic
devices. Accordingly, this study selected the PANF as the catalyst supporter for DMFC applications
hereafter. In order to pursue an optimum electrode capability, this study investigated the effects of
the reduction agent type and the PANF amount on the electrocatalytic properties of the Pt/PANF
catalysts.

the formic acid and the -NH group on the PANF supporters. Several recent studies report that the
electrostatic interaction formed between the carboxylic acid group of the added stability agent and
the NH2+ group on the modified carbon black can strengthen the bonding of Au ions on the carbon
surface and thus lead to a uniform distribution of Au particles on the carbon surface [60-61].
Consequently, Guo et al. reported that pretreating the activated carbon with excess ammonium
hydroxide and adding a stabilizing agent containing the carboxylic acid group in the reaction
solutions are essential steps for depositing a uniform distribution of Pt particles on the carbon surface
[62]. These findings indicate that the specific interaction formed between the carboxylic group in the
stabilizing agent and the -NH group on the supporter can promote the formation of uniformly
distributed Pt particles on the supporter surface. This implies that the specific interaction formed
between the carboxylic group in the formic acid and the -NH group on the PANF can be the primary
factor in forming uniformly distributed Pt particles on the PANF surface.
Besides, UV/Vis spectroscopy has been used to measure the reduction rate of the Pt precursor with
the use of different reductants. As Figures 1.5 shows, NaBH4 leads to a higher reduction rate than
formic acid. The absorbance of the peak at ~250 nm with the NaBH4 is only one fifth to that with the
formic acid at the reaction time of 10 min. The higher reduction rate from NaBH4 may lead to a
higher concentration of Pt nucleate formed at the initial reaction stage and thus leads to the
aggregation of Pt particles during the reaction process [63]. In contrast, the lower reduction rate from
formic acid may allow the as-synthesized Pt particles to be deposited on the polyaniline surface and
thus prevent the aggregation of metal particles during the reaction process [64-65]. We therefore
infer that the relatively homogenous morphology of the Pt particles with the use of formic acid can
be ascribed to the specific interaction between polyaniline and formic acid as well as the lower
reducing rate with the use of formic acid.

different amounts of PANF to the reaction solutions. Figure 1.8(a) shows a homogeneous Pt particles
deposited on the PANF with the adding of 10mg PANF to the reaction solution. However, Figure
1.8(b) shows that decreasing the PANF amount to 2.5 mg leads to an ultra high density of Pt
particles with the formation of a thicker Pt particle layer on the PANF surface. It is worth noting that
this thicker Pt layer on the PANF surface may block the interaction between the outside Pt particles
and the PANF supporters. The specific interaction formed between Pt and PANI helps prevent the
adsorption of CO on the Pt particle [68-69]. Accordingly, it is reasonable to suggest that a suitable
amount of Pt with a homogeneous distribution on the PANF surface enhances the catalyst poisoning
tolerance of the Pt/PANF catalyst, and can be achieved simply by adjusting the PANF loading
amount in the reaction solution.
Along with the successful improvement of the catalytic ability and poisoning tolerance of the
PANF-supported Pt catalysts, this study compares the associated catalytic properties of the
PANF-supported Pt with commercial XC-72 carbon black-supported Pt to demonstrate the advantage
of using PANF as Pt supporters for DMFC applications.

3.1.4 Comparison of electrochemical properties of Pt/PANF and Pt/XC-72
Figure 1.9 shows the CV curves of the commercial XC-72 carbon- and PANF-supported Pt catalysts
in 1M methanol and 0.5M H2SO4 solutions. The PANF-supported Pt catalysts show a slightly higher
oxidation current (0.7V) than that of the XC-72-supported Pt catalysts in the forward scan, indicating
that the PANF-supported Pt catalysts have better methanol oxidation ability. However, in the reverse
scan, the PANF-supported Pt catalyst exhibits a significantly lower current peak (0.47V).
Consequently, the Pt/PANF shows a significantly higher current peak ratio of the forward current
peak to the reverse current peak (If/Ib) than that of Pt/XC-72. The If/Ib ratios for the Pt/PANF and
Pt/XC-72 catalysts are 1.45 and 0.87, respectively. The higher If/Ib ratio indicates that the Pt/PANF
catalyst has a better ability to oxidize methanol to carbon dioxide and leads to less accumulation of
carbonaceous on the catalyst surface [66-67]. Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that the use of
PANF as a catalyst supporter can enhance the Pt catalyst to possess better methanol oxidation ability
and higher poisoning tolerance than XC-72, and these are significant characteristics related to the
performance and operation stability of DMFC.

tolerance of the PANF-supported Pt catalysts (Fig. 1.9) and demonstrate that using Pt/PANF as an
anode catalyst can efficiently improve the operation stability of DMFC.

in the reaction solution.
3.2 An effective layout of polyaniline nanofibers incorporated in MEA as methanol transport
regulator for DMFC
3.2.1 Characterization of as-synthesized PANFs
Figure 2.1 shows the SEM images of the polyaniline samples synthesized in an ultra-sonication
environment with an [aniline]/[APS] molar ratio of 0.8:1 at 50 oC. As can be seen, the as-synthesized
products exhibit a fibrous morphology with a diameter of about 50 nm (Figure 2.1(a)). Besides, after
a de-doping process by 0.1M NH4OH solution and a re-doping process by 0.25M HCl solution, these
samples still keep their shape in nanofibers (Figure 2.1(b-c)). These results indicate that the adopted
reaction conditions are useful to produce PANFs and confirm the post-treatment does not
significantly affect their morphology in nanofiber.
Figure 2.2 shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the PANFs dispersed in de-ionized water. As can
be seen, the spectra of the as-synthesized and re-doped PANFs exhibit three primary absorption
bands at the wavelength of 320–360, 400–420, and 700–800 nm respectively. The first absorption
band arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments. The second and the third
absorption bands relate to doping level and polaron formation, respectively. These characteristics are
consistent with those reported in the literatures, attributed to the presence of the acid-doped state of
PANFs [70-71]. After de-doping process, the sample exhibits only two strong absorption bands at
~340 nm and 600-700 nm, reflecting the formation of a de-doped state of polyaniline [71]. These
results indicate that the as-synthesized PANFs are in emeraldine salt structure and the
post-treatments are useful to adjust the doping states of PANFs.
3.2.2Effect of PANFs layout in anode
Since the PANFs had been successfully synthesized, they were subsequently incorporated into
anodic side to serve as a methanol transport regulator. Figure 2.3(a) compares the three types of
MEAs in DMFC performance. The polarization curve reveals to place a layer of PANFs between CL
and GDL in anode can promote the DMFC performance to exhibit a highest power density of 49
mW cm-2. However, a significantly lower power density of 28 mW cm-2 was obtained from the one

Figure 2.2 UV-Vis spectra of the PANFs at different doping states
Based on above results, there is a good reason to draw a temporary conclusion that to place a layer of
PANFs between GDL and CL is an idea approach to modify GDE for improving DMFC
performance. Hereafter, it is therefore adopted as a method to modify the anode and the other critical
factors, including dopant type and doping level for PANFs, which affect the characteristics of the
modified GDE, are investigated extensively.

different layouts. (b) EIS spectra of the anodes with the incorporation of the as-synthesized PANFs through

3.2.3 Comparison of the MEAs with and without PANFs incorporation
The mass transport properties in anode with and without the incorporation of PANFs were measured
to demonstrate the advantage of such a modification. Figure 2.4(a) shows the EIS spectra of the
anodes with and without placing a layer of PANFs between CL and GDL. In high-frequency area,

Figure 2.5 compares the DMFC performances of MEAs with and without the incorporation of
PANFs in anodes. As can be seen, the PANFs-incorporated MEA exhibits a power density of 49 mW
cm-2, higher than that obtained from the pristine one (44 mW cm-2). This higher DMFC performance
can be attributed to the incorporation of PANFs, which effectively lowers methanol transport
resistance in anode and synergistically depresses methanol crossover from anode to cathode. These
characteristics are substantially helpful to reduce catalyst poisoning and improve fuel conversion
efficiency in anode [77-78].
3.2.4 Effect of doping state of PANFs
The effect of doping state of PANFs on the related properties of the MEAs was investigated by
preparing a series of PANFs with various dopants as well as the de-doped PANFs. The
as-synthesized PANFs were firstly immersed in NH4OH solution to reach a de-doped state and
followed by a re-doping treatment in various acid solutions, including H2SO4, HCl, and
camphorsulfonic acid (CSA). It should be bear in mind that to change PANFs doping state will
simultaneously alter their hydrophilicity and therefore influence the characteristics of the modified
MEA. It had also been reported the acid-doped polyaniline exhibits a significantly higher
hydrophilicity than the de-doped one [79]. Besides, our previous study indicated that a GDE
modified with H2SO4-doped PANFs exhibited a higher hydrophilicity than HCl-doped PANFs [72].
Moreover, the hydrophilicity in GDE may also have an influence on the methanol transport in MEA
[80]. In order to clarify the effects of doping state of PANFs on the associated properties of MEA
regarding methanol transport, an extended study about this concern will be given as follows.

crossover curves of the MEAs incorporated with PANFs at different doping states
Fig. 2.6(a) shows the EIS spectra of the anode incorporated with the PANFs with different doping
states. As can be seen, the de-doped PANFs incorporated in anode would result in a larger loop and a
larger intercept with the real axis in low-frequency area than the others incorporated with acid-doped
PANFs. Moreover, among the acid-doped PANFs, HCl-doped PANFs result in a larger loop and a
higher intercept than those obtained from doping with CSA and H2SO4. It indicates that a different

3.2.5 Effect of doping level of PANFs
To further investigate the effect of PANFs conductivity on the performance of the modified MEA,
the doping level of the H2SO4-doped PANFs was varied by immersing the de-doped PANFs in
H2SO4 solution with different concentrations, from 0.25 to 3M. As H2SO4 concentration increases
from 0.25 to 2M, the conductivity of the re-doped PANFs increased from 1.2 to 2.8 S cm-1.
Figure 2.7 DMFC performances of the MEAs incorporated with PANFs at different doping states.
Figure 2.8 shows the polarization curves of the DMFCs with the modified anodes incorporated with
PANFs at different doping levels. As can be seen, the DMFC incorporated with H2SO4(2M)-doped
PANFs results in a power density of 53 mW cm-2, obviously higher than that obtained from the one
incorporated with H2SO4(0.25 M)-doped PANFs (48 mW cm-2). Moreover, all cells incorporated
with H2SO4-doped PANFs exhibit higher power density than that obtained from the pristine one
without incorporating PANFs. The higher power density of the DMFC may be attributed to the
higher electrical conductivity of H2SO4-doped PANFs. However, when H2SO4(3M)-doped PANFs
was adopted as the modifier, a significant drop of DMFC performance(34 mW cm-2) was measured,
in spite of the higher conductivity of H2SO4(3M)-doped PANFs (σ= 4.97 S cm-1). We noticed the
variation of PANFs morphology at higher doping levels, which may be responsible for the poor
DMFC performance.

levels.

4. Conclusions
This study investigates the morphology-dependent electrochemical properties of polyaniline
micro/nanostructures. It is verified that polyaniline nanofibers with higher electrochemical surface
area are highly suitable candidate for DMFC applications. Well dispersed Pt particles on the PANF
surface can be achieved by using formic acid as a reduction agent and can therefore enhance the
catalytic ability of Pt. Moreover, the use of PANF as a catalyst supporter exhibits better methanol
oxidation ability and higher CO poisoning tolerance than that of the commercial XC-72 carbon black.
These characteristics are favorable for the single cell performance and the operation stability of
DMFC. Measurements of DMFC test reveal that using Pt/PANF as the anode catalyst can yield not
only higher power density but also better operation stability as compared to those obtained by using
Pt/XC-72 catalyst. On the other hand, this study also demonstrates an effective strategy of PANFs
layout incorporated in MEA to act as methanol transport regulator for DMFC. Polarization curves
reveal that to place a layer of PANFs between GDL and CL in anode improves DMFC performance
in terms of power density. Besides, the doping state of PANFs also plays an important role in
determining the profit of the PANFs-modified MEAs. The modified MEA with acid-doped PANFs
exhibits a higher power density than the one with de-doped PANFs. Compared with HCl-doped
PANFs and H2SO4-doped PANFs, CSA-doped PANFs are more effective in improving DMFC
performance, which can be correlated well with the lower methanol transport resistance in anode and
methanol crossover from anode to cathode. Besides, doping level is also a critical factor in
determining electric conductivity and morphology of the PANFs so that it influences the MEA in
electron transport and methanol regulating efficiency. An aggregation phenomena of the
H2SO4(3M)-doped PANFs due to excessive doping level is prone to result in higher methanol
transport resistance in anode and consequently deteriorates DMFC performance. This study
demonstrates a simple and efficient way to enhance methanol oxidation ability and CO poisoning
tolerance of Pt as well as to reduce the methanol transport resistance in anode and methanol
crossover from anode to cathode.

7三、 心得
WASET 為 World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology 之簡稱，是一
個結合科技、工程、與技術之歷史悠久的國際會議組織。它的特色是結合各種工程科
技領域的學者快速且頻繁的達到學術交流之目的。它每一年均選在世界各大城市，如
日本東京，新加坡，法國巴黎，奧地利維也納，瑞士日內瓦，德國柏林，荷蘭阿姆斯
特丹，義大利羅馬等著名城市，舉辦一年多次的會議，但每次會議大多以 2 天為期，
由於領域多而廣，反而易達到其它會議所無法達到之國際工程科技學術界大交流之目
