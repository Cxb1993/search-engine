2. English Abstract 
 
In this project, we have investigated the device characteristics of the HFET structure with a 
dilute InGaAsN channel layer, grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. By 
integrating N atoms into the InGaAs channel can effectively decrease the effective energy 
bandgap as compared to conventional InGaAs channels. The present device exhibits improved 
DC characteristics and thermal stability due to the enhanced channel confinement capability by 
using a novel, low-gap and dilute InGaAsN channel. Therefore, the influences on device 
performances, such as drain current, breakdown, extrinsic transconductances, gate-voltage swing, 
thermal stability, and high-frequency characteristics, have been comprehensively investigated.

3. Introduction 
 
Dilute nitride quaternary compounds InxGa1-xAs1-yNy have been intensively studied in the 
past few years [1-2]. The technological importance of the novel InGaAsN alloy has first been 
pointed out in the pioneering work by Kondow et al.[3]. Figure 1 shows the relationship between 
the lattice constant and bandgap energy in III–V alloy semiconductors, including GaAsN and 
InGaAsN. The bowing parameter of GaAsN was derived from experimental results for GaAsN 
with small nitrogen content [4], assuming a parabolic relationship. Conventional alloy 
semiconductors, which lie in the dotted area in Figure 1, have a tendency toward increasing 
bandgap energy with decreasing lattice constant. On the other hand, the GaAsN sticks out of the 
dotted area for conventional alloy semiconductors. Up until an N content in GaAsN of one half, 
an increase in N content causes a monotonic decrease in the bandgap energy rather than an 
increase toward that of cubic GaN (3.2eV). This curious behavior agrees with the experimental 
results [5-6] and theoretical prediction [7] which were previously reported by the other research 
groups. This phenomenon is explained in terms of the discrepancy in electro negativity among 
constitutional atoms. According to Phillips [8], the electro negativity of N is 3.00, while that of P, 
As, or Sb is in a range from 1.31 to 1.64. Since the mixed group-V nitride alloy semiconductors 
have the property in which decreasing lattice constant decreases, instead of increases, the 
layer. The studied device was grown on the GaAs substrate by the Riber Epineat solid-source 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). A radio-frequency (RF) coupled plasma source was employed to 
generate the reactive nitrogen radicals from the high-purity N2 gas. The intensity of the plasma 
can be controlled by the RF power and the flow rate of N2. A photodetector was used to measure 
the plasma light intensity. The InGaAsN/GaAs layers were grown at low temperatures to 
suppress the phase separation caused by the nitrogen incorporation. The optimal growth 
temperatures for the InGaAsN layer was found to be within 400 – 420℃ [15], which is lower 
than that of the GaAsN alloys [16]. The growth temperature of GaAs and AlGaAs was 600℃. It 
is well known that the defects or non-radiative impurities, such as arsenic anti-site or interstitial 
defects, relate to the low growth temperature. Through the annealing process, the defects or 
non-radiative impurities can be removed. Consequently, in situ 770℃ annealing for 5 minutes 
was employed after the growth of AlGaAs carrier supply layer [11][16]. Hall measurements were 
carried out on the sample to characterize the two-dimensional electron gas concentration (n2DEG) 
and the electron mobility ( μn) at 300 K and 77 K, respectively, under a magnetic field of 5000 G. 
The values of μn and the corresponding n2DEG are 218 (300) cm2/V-s and 6.25 (4) × 1012 cm-2 at 
300 K (77 K), respectively. Standard photolithography, lift-off, and rapid thermal annealing 
(RTA) techniques were employed for device fabrication. AuGeNi/Au alloys were used for source 
and drain ohmic contacts, onto which Au was evaporated to reduce the contact resistance. Au 
was deposited on the undoped AlGaAs Schottky layer as the gate electrode. The gate dimensions 
were 0.65 × 200 μm2 with the drain-to-source spacing of 4 μm. The mesa etching was performed 
down to the buffer layer to reduce the gate leakage current. H3PO4/H2O2/H2O solution was used 
for etching the GaAs cap layer. 
 
5. Experimental Results and Discussions 
 
In comparison, Figure 2 also shows the corresponding conduction -band diagram of the 
InGaAsN/GaAs HFET (solid line) and that of using a conventional InGaAs channel (dotted line), 
respectively. The conduction band discontinuity (ΔEC) of the InxGa1-xAs/GaAs (0 < x < 0.3) 
heterojuction can be expressed by ΔEC = 0.75x eV [17], indicating that discontinuity value is 
linearly proportional to the indium composition, x. On the other hand, the ΔEC value of the 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01/GaAs heterostructure was determined to be 401 meV [18], which is about 
176 meV larger than that of In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs interface. Consequently, this work uses the 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01 nitride as the channel material in order to further enhance the ΔEC and to 
improve the channel confinement capability. Figure 3 shows the secondary ion mass 
spectrometry (SIMS) intensity as a function of the junction depth of the InGaAsN/GaAs HEMT. 
The InGaAsN channel is inserted about 60 nm below the wafer surface. The Ga and As ions were 
both maintained with stable amounts during the sample growth, but both the In and N ion 
intensities were increased to their maximums at about 65 nm deep. The SIMS profiles 
demonstrated the successful incorporation of the N atoms within the channel growth. The N 
atoms reacted like surfactants to be slightly incorporated into the InGaAs film to enhance the 
conduction-band discontinuity. Figure 4 shows the typical current-voltage characteristics of the 
InGaAsN/GaAs HFET at 300 K. Good pinch-off characteristics have been achieved. It is mainly 
HEMT at different temperatures. The reverse gate-drain breakdown voltage (BVGD) is defined to 
be the two-terminal reverse gate-to-drain voltages, at which the gate current density reaches 1 
mA/mm. The two-terminal gate-drain breakdown voltage (BVGD) is -15.8 V for InGaAsN/GaAs 
HFET at room temperature. The measured BVGD, are -15.8 V, -16.33 V, -16.67 V, -16.41 V, 
-15.09 V, and -14.40 V at 300 K, 340 K, 380 K, 420 K, and 450 K, respectively. The lower BVGD 
means the superior sustaining capability of the electric field within the gate-drain regime. In 
addition, the higher Von allows a larger induced current in the channel at an extended forward 
gate bias. The improved BVGD characteristics can enhance the device operation range. The 
breakdown voltage of the proposed device is superior to other HFETs, as compared in Table 1 
[25]-[27]. 
Since both the gate breakdown and forward-biased leakages depend on thecombinational 
effects of the Schottky barrier and the impact ionization mechanism in the channel. As indicated 
in the band diagram of Fig. 2, the gate engineering was devised by using a wide-gap AlGaAs 
Schottky layer to increase the Schottky barrier height, and by employing InGaAsN channel/GaAs 
spacer heterostructure to enhance its conduction discontinuity. Both can greatly prevent the 
channel electrons being injected into the gate terminal, leading to the significant improvement in 
the gate leakages. Additionally, larger electron effective mass within the InGaAsN channel 
[28]-[29] can further improve the impact-ionization effects, and consequently resulting in the 
superior BVGD and Von characteristics. It is noted that the breakdown voltage increases with the 
temperature form 300 K to 360 K, as shown in Fig. 6(a). This is mainly attributed to the degraded 
transport characteristics with the increased temperature, resulted from the enhanced scattering 
mechanisms. However, the breakdown voltage was observed to decrease form 390 K to 450 K, as 
shown in Fig. 6(b). Interesting polarity change may be due to the switching of dominant 
mechanism from the former scattering phenomenon at lower temperatures to the combinational 
effects of the enhanced barrier-lowering, the tunneling, and the reduced effective bandgap [30] 
mechanisms at higher temperatures. Figure 7 shows the temperature-dependent characteristics of 
gm,max and the threshold voltage (Vth), respectively, from 300 K to 450 K at VDS = 3 V. The 
values of Vth are -1.817, -1.833, -1.852, -1.883, -1.925, and -1.978 V at 300 K, 330 K, 360 K, 
390 K, 420 K, and 450 K, respectively. The threshold shift (ΔVth) from 300 K to 450 K is only 
0.161 V. The thermal threshold coefficient (∂Vth/∂T) is superiorly to be -1.07 mV/K. The studied 
device also demonstrates improved thermal threshold stability than those of other HFETs, as 
compared in Table 2 [25], [27], [30-31]. 
Since the origin of the temperature dependence of Vth is attributed to the excessive leakage 
current through the substrate, the comparisons made in Table 2 were assumed with the similar 
drain bias conditions. The use of the InGaAsN channel/GaAs buffer with the enhanced 
discontinuity barrier can provide improved carrier confinement capability at higher temperatures, 
which is similar to the superior pinch-off characteristics, as discussed in the previous sections. 
These improved results empower the present device to be suitable for the digital integrated circuit 
applications, in which the control of threshold voltage is an important criterion. The microwave 
characteristics of the studied HFET were characterized by an HP8510B vector network analyzer 
in conjunction with the Cascade probes over the range from 0.5 GHz to 20 GHz. The gate 
dimensions of the HFET were 0.65 × 200 μm2. The unity gain cut-off frequency (fT) and the

TBADN:(0.5%)rubrene/(50 Å)TBADN (Device V). 10 
Å lithium fluoride (LiF) is used to facilitate the injection 
of electron and followed by Aluminum of 1200 Å as 
cathode in all devices. The difference in Device II and 
Device III is the addition of 100 Å 
2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) 
which is used as hole-blocking layer (HBL). The active 
area of all devices is 0.09 cm2 and all measurement are 
completed under air environment. Relationship between 
voltage, current density and luminance are measured by 
Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter correlating 
with Keithley 2400 source meter. Electroluminescence 
spectra are described by Ocean Optics USB4000 
spectrometer calibrated with LS-1-CAL standard source. 
In addition, USB4000 are also used to characterize the 
photoluminescence and absorption spectra of materials 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
 Efficient energy transfer between TBADN and 
rubrene can be expected from obvious overlapping of 
their photoluminescence and absorption spectrum. 
However, the high quantum efficiency of rubrene limits 
the doping concentration of rubrene into the TBADN 
host. The optimal doping concentration in Device I is 
0.5% to obtain high efficiency and pure white emission. 
Energy-level diagram of Device I are illustrated in Fig. 
1(a). 
 
Fig. 1 Schematic energy-level diagrams of devices 
Energy barriers of 0.4 electron-volt (eV) for 
hole-transporting and 0.5 eV for electrons-transporting at 
the interface of HTL and EML in Device I provide 
carriers a primary zone to recombine. The highest 
current efficiency of 4.26 cd/A can be obtained in Device 
I. 
 Obvious decay of efficiency at high luminance is 
exhibited in Device I due in part to the small energy 
barriers between EML and ETL which cannot produce 
effective recombination of carriers. Extending the 
carriers transport distance to maintain efficient 
recombination of carriers at high current density can 
eliminate the limitation. To do so, Device II divides EML 
into two layers by an Alq3 layer. The current efficiency 
in Device II can be enhanced from 3.26 cd/A to 3.72 
cd/A at 10,000 cd/m2 luminance according to the 
efficiency relationship in Fig. 2. The improvement of 
efficiency can be attributed to low mobility of hole in 
Alq3 layer between two EMLs which causes efficient 
emission in right side EML at high current density even 
though small energy barrier there. 
 
Fig. 2 Current efficiency of WOLEDs 
 However, obvious yellow emission in Device II 
occurs, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The Alq3 layer 
between dual-EMLs has occasion to emit light, which 
may be absorbed by the rubrene in EMLs due to 
overlapping of photoluminescence spectrum of Alq3 and 
absorption spectrum of rubrene as shown in Fig. 4. 
Consequently the yellow emission in Device II increases. 
The yellow-shift phenomenon in Device III is more 
apparent than in Device II when inserting BCP layer 
between EML and ETL. The CIE coordinates shifts from 
(0.36, 0.40) in Device II to (0.36, 0.42) in Device III. In 
addition to the influence of energy transfer from Alq3 to 
rubrene, electrons from BCP inject into the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of rubrene

(Sample A), and (b) with SiNx passivation (Sample 
B). 
Standard photolithography, lift-off and the rapid 
thermal annealing (RTA) techniques were employed for 
the device fabrication. The mesa etching was performed 
down to the buffer layer to reduce the gate leakages 
current. AuGeNi/Au alloys were used for the 
source/drain ohmic contacts, onto which Au was 
evaporated to reduce the contact resistance. Then 
n+-GaAs cap layer were removed by using a 
H3PO4/H2O2/H2O wet-etching solution, and sample A 
was immediately passivated by soaking in the 
ammonia–sulfide [(NH4)2Sx, 5%] solution for 12 minutes 
at 300 K. On the other hand, after the source/drain 
depositions for sample B, the gate-recess etching was 
performed to remove the n+-GaAs capper. Then, a 10 
nm-thick SiNx passivation layer was deposited upon the 
Schottky layer at 300 °C by using the plasma-enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. After the 
gate definition process, the HF solution was used to 
remove silicon nitride to open the gate window. 
Consequently, Au-gate electrode was deposited on the 
undoped GaAs Schottky-contact layer. Finally, the 
following lift-off process was conducted to complete the 
device fabrications, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b). 
3. Experimental Results and Discussions 
 
Figure 2 shows the typical current-voltage 
characteristics of the studied InGaAsSb/GaAs HEMTs 
with or without passivations at 300 K, respectively. The 
applied gate-source voltage was kept at VGS = −0.5 
V/step. The drain-source saturation current densities 
(IDSS), defined at VGS = 0 V, are 205, 190, and 174 
mA/mm for samples A-C, respectively. Sample A and B 
have shown higher IDSS values, since the surface 
passivations can effectively reduce the interface-state 
effects to increase the channel cross section.

Fig. 2 Current-voltage characteristics at 300K for the 
studied InGaAs(Sb)/GaAs HEMTs. 
The two-terminal gate-drain I-V characteristics at 
room temperature for the studied samples indicate in Fig. 
3. The gate-drain forward turn-on voltage (Von) and 
breakdown voltage (BVGD), defined at |IG| = 1 mA/mm, 
are 0.8/-13.3, 0.7/-8.8, and 0.5/-7.2 V for samples A, B, 
and C, respectively. Sample A has shown the best 
gate-drain isolation property than samples B and C, since 
the (NH4)2Sx-treatment can effectively annihilate and 
surface states within the high-field gate-drain regime to 
significantly decrease the gate leakages.
