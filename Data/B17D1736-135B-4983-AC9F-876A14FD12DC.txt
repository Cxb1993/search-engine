1. Introduction  
1.1 Background 
The operations of a nuclear power plant (NPP) involve complex, uncertain, and 
high-risk tasks that require knowledge of plant systems and procedures, including 
system interactions and limiting conditions for operation (Thomas, 1987). The tasks 
in main control room (MCR) are usually accomplished by members of the team rather 
than a single operator. In such working environments, the technology with team 
interaction must be designed to assist teams (Sebok, 2000) because team skills are 
essential to cope with situations successfully especially during Emergency Operating 
Procedures (EOP) (Ford & Schmidt, 2000). The emergent events consist of 
characteristics such as low frequency, high consequence, time stress, and a heavy 
information requirement (Belardo, 1981). In NPPs, the importance of the 
computer-based technology and easy-to-use procedures to handle major plant 
disturbances have been recognized since the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in the 
US in 1979 (NUREG-6691, 2000). Increasing automation changes the nature of the 
tasks and imposes new coordination demands on the human operators because more 
and more tasks are allocated to the computer, leaving only leftover tasks to the 
operator in the end (Nachreiner et al., 2006). Based on those, the author would like to 
further discuss the following issue. The traditional equipment and/or interface have 
been designed to focus on the individual user and single operator’s performance rather 
than team performance (Sebok, 2000) and the conventional operating procedures have 
been paper-based to present limited information to the operators (NUREG-6691, 
2000). 
3 
The primary purpose of this study is to develop a system providing computerized 
procedures in control room of NPPs to support team interaction and performance. 
1.3 Method and steps 
Figure 1 depicts the whole diagram of this study. The first step is to understand 
the function of alarm reset modes, the feature of paper procedures, and the interaction 
among operators, control panel/interface, and assigned tasks in NPP. Then, a series of 
experiments, Experiment A and B, has been respectively laid out.  
In Experiment A, a computerized graphic interface was designed by applying a 
Dynamic Work Causality Equation (DWCE) model and combining the contents of 
procedures. The performance of using the computerized graphic interface on 
abnormal operating procedures (AOP) and EOP was evaluated in the simulated 
system. Objective measures of the system included operation time and accuracy of 
action, and subjective measures of open-ended were taken. It was expected to develop 
and verify a suitable graphic interface for NPPs. Finally, the results provided several 
information and suggestions to the following experiment. In Experiment B, two 
variants of teamwork system were designed: one provides computerized procedure 
and the other one requires paper procedures. An experiment was conducted to 
compare team performance and user subjective ratings using a computerized 
procedure interface versus the interface requiring paper procedures. Then, a 
subsequent experiment was conducted to compare two teams with different sizes (2 
persons and 3 persons) to a single operator on operation performance and user 
subjective ratings as using computerized procedures.  
Finally, the suggestions of developing computerized graphic interface and 
teamwork system were provided to the NPPs and the similar industries from the 
experimental results, included Experiment A and B.

2. Literature review 
In traditional MCRs, the alarm signals are each displayed by a pilot lamp 
corresponding to one or more indicators displaying different parameters in the reactor 
system. Additionally, the operators maintain the reactor system by direct control 
devices. All alarm signals, indicators, and direct control devices are laid on control 
panel. Figure 2 displays the role for each team member and the interaction between 
the fellows and the large control panel. The arrows of dotted line are showed team 
interaction. In contrast, the arrows are showed that interaction between operators and 
the control panel. The panel displays the states of running reactor system and provides 
the direct control devices. When alarm signal has been presented by auditory and 
visual alerts on the panel, the operators should make decision and execute action on it 
according to specific procedure. It is generally recognized that the operating 
procedure plays an important role in the day-to-day management of NPP operations 
(Jenkinson, 1992; Livingston, 1989; Trump & Stave, 1988; Swezey, 1987; 
NUREG-0660, 1980).  
7 
sections. 
2.2 Background 
After the TMI accident, the importance of information technology and 
automation was brought to public attention (Niwa et al., 1996). According to O’Hara 
& Hall (1992), Reinartz (1993), Chang et al., (1999), and Sebok (2000), four 
important trends in the evolution of advanced control rooms are: 1) increased 
automation, 2) the development of computer-based workstations, 3) the development 
of intelligent operator aids, and 4) provided useful information on interfaces. 
Increased automation and information technology is expected to decrease operators’ 
workload, maintain operators’ situational awareness, and prevent operation errors. 
Several previous researches have proved the function of automation and information 
technology in NPPs; for instances, the operator using automatic plant safeguard 
systems may initiate recovering actions to minimize radiation release and equipment 
damage, return the plant to a stable condition, and ensure that critical safety functions 
are maintained (Roth, 1994). Also, the computerized support system could effectively 
support operation performance, especially under emergency conditions. Because 
computer support can deal with large and complex systems, it would be a powerful 
method for emergency operation (Peng & Hwang, 1994). In this research, automation 
technology would be applied to develop a computerized procedure. 
2.1.1 Paper-based procedures  
Operating procedures provide instructions to guide operators in monitoring, 
decision making, and controlling the plant. In NPPs, procedures are commonly 
presented to operators in paper forms. Paper procedures present information in 
sequential, requiring numerous interactions through steps, and cautions or warnings 
9 
human move from outside to inside an information space (Benyon, 2001). Operational 
environment of large systems is changing rapidly with the advance of computer 
technologies. In NPPs, for instance, operations are automated during not only plant 
startup and shutdown but also steady and abnormal plant conditions. In addition, 
indicators on a control panel are also changed into CRT displays. Also, during the 
1980s, the commercial nuclear power industry increased its investment in automated 
information sharing, which has lead to more frequent use of information management 
tools. This growth reflects the expansion of computing power to include plant 
operations and maintenance personnel, who need timely system performance data. 
The aids of computer are not substitutes for humans, but are used to assist humans 
(Nishitani, 1996). These are for reducing operators’ workloads and for preventing 
resultant operational errors (Inagaki, 1993). However, the operating procedures in the 
previous researches were not considered on the graphic system/interface. Here, the 
development of a computerized procedure is expected to enhance the effectiveness of 
the procedures and prevent its misuse.  
2.1.2.1 Interface with computerized procedure 
The factor of the interactions between humans and machines/computers becomes 
an important issue as automation technology and equipment are widely used (Rook & 
Donnell, 1993). A virtual environment displayed on desktop display screens could 
improve graphics quality, flexibility, user comfort, etc (Wilson, 1997). Hori & 
Shimizu (1999) proposed that the designer should consider plant features, human 
factors, and specification limitations so that the design concepts based on human 
ability and operation safety could be taken into account in interface design. Also, 
several pervious researches have studied the effects of graphic interfaces for training 
operators in real situation of NPPs, e.g. Al-mugrabi & Po (1997) and Po et al. (2000). 
The user interface in supporting and training users included prompts, feedback, status 
11 
proposed system. Huang & Hwang (2003a) has transformed the contents of 
procedures into flowchart by DWCE, and developed a computerized graphical 
interface with it. The operating interface, which is shown in Figure 4, contains two 
major parts: the upper part shows the complete flowchart situation and key statements 
in real time, also combining the operations parts by control buttons; whereas the 
bottom part presents the complete procedure statements and denotation of status quo. 
In addition, the screen design should centralize all signals in a window so that each 
supporting statement appears properly and automatically. In addition, message boxes 
should show feedback immediately. In this way, providing the statements for decision 
support can reduce mental workload of the operators. 
The interface has three major functions as follows: 
a. Operations: The operations use control buttons. To enter each decision event and 
action event, with one control button containing only one meaning and one event 
to distinguish them from one another. Ergonomic requirements for pointing 
devices include the keyboards or mouse, tracker ball, etc. (Stewart, 2000), this 
system uses a mouse. 
b. Reaffirming: When the operator makes a decision or completes an action, a 
“correct” or “wrong” message will appear in the dialogue windows. Providing 
feedback in the dialogue window may prevent hasty decisions or repeated actions, 
as well as indicating whether an action is right or wrong. 
c. Procedure guide: The task statement on the screen include three parts; decision or 
action statements that are near the control button in the flowchart, statements of 
procedure content, and denotation of each status quo to assist decision. All the 
statements will rapidly appear in a fixed location if an event occurs. Such an 
arrangement may help to shorten operators’ reaction time and improve the 
effectiveness of decision-making. 
 13 
Figure 4. Computerized graphical interface (Huang & Hwang, 2003b) 
2.1.3 Team  
In NPPs, tasks can only be accomplished by a team because the single operator’s ability is 
limited. A team can be defined as a distinguishable set of two or more individuals who interact 
dynamically, interdependently, and adaptively toward a common, specified, shared, and valued 
goal/objective/mission. The individual team members are each assigned specific roles or functions 
to perform (Morgan et al., 1986; Salas et al., 1992). A small team in MCR of NPPs generally 
includes a team leader and two operators. When an event occurs, it is the operators’ and leader’s 
responsibilities to diagnose the event from a myriad of indicators. The leader assigns tasks to 
operators. Each operator must search for, read, and follow the paper procedure steps in order to 
resolve the problem; meanwhile, the leader tracks operators to confirm that they have done the 
right action. In such working environment, the operators often engage in and carry out the assigned 
tasks and exclude interaction with other operators. To develop a members’ behavior in a complex 
operating system, Glickman et al. (1987) argued that proficiency in both taskwork skills and 
 15 
ensure that everything is running as expected and everyone is following procedures correctly 
and in a timely manner (McIntyre & Salas, 1995). 
d. Coordination: Coordination is performed by meta-operations that organize operations to fulfill 
certain criteria (Suchman, 1987; Hoc, 1988). The coordination demands of a team task require 
greater use of members’ cognitive resources (Kidd, 1961; Kontogiannis & Kossiavelou, 1999; 
Ford & Schmidt, 2000). 
e. Communication: Communication among team members is to understand how their actions 
affect and are affected by each of the other fellows and is critical for the successful completion 
of tasks (Scholtes, 1988; Ford & Schmidt, 2000). Likewise, leader is a central person to lead a 
team having good communications (Leavitt, 1951).  
f. Decision making skills: Team decision making is a process that involves gathering, processing, 
integrating, and communicating information in arriving at a task-relevant decision to 
accomplish a specific task rather than simply to make a decision (Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993; 
Jones & Roelofsma, 2000). 
g. Team workload: It is the relationship between the finite cognitive capacities of a team and the 
demands placed on the team (Bowers et al., 1992). That is an important contributor to team 
stress and can be reduced by sharing tasks, providing feedback, and coordinating and 
correcting each other (Orasanu & Salas, 1993; Morgan & Bowers, 1995). 
Several studies have demonstrated that teamwork systems with computerized assistance can 
provide efficient communication strategies, reduce human error, support higher team performance 
and situational awareness, and organize operators (e.g. Plott et al., 1995; Volpe et al., 1996; 
Hallbert et al., 1997; Furuta et al., 1999; Skitka, 1999).  
2.1.4 Team size  
The team size can be defined as the number of members who are available to work on the 
tasks. It may influence team behavior (Morgan & Bowers, 1995) and has an impact on members’ 
 17 
3. Experiment A: evaluation of computerized graphic interface 
Experiment A was conducted to investigate the effect of using a graphic interface with 
computerized procedure on individual performance. A proposed interface and the experimental 
method are described in the following sections.  
3.1 Computerized graphic interface 
In this study, the computerized graphic interface system is a small-scale virtual system. The 
procedures of basic watermark control and alternative watermark control, which are part of 
Procedure 500.3 EOP-RC, are selected (the contents of traditional operating procedure for basic 
watermark control and alternative watermark control are shown in Appendix A). Based on the 
principle of computerized graphic interface design, the interface of watermark system was 
developed and then an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of this interface system on 
operation performance. 
3.1.1 Applying DWCE model 
DWCE model was applied to transform the basic watermark control and alternative 
watermark control procedures into flowcharts. These flowcharts were used for the design of the 
proposed interface.  
3.1.2 Interface design of watermark system 
Visual Basic 6.0, which is an object-oriented programming and visual program, is used to 
design the proposed interface. The flowchart of procedure includes the status, decision, and action 
components, which are represented by the green light, red light, and yellow light respectively in 
the interface. Huang and Hwang (2003a) has verified that applying the AOP computerized graphic

3.2 Method 
This experiment was conducted to investigate the operation performance of using 
computerized graphic interface on AOP and EOP.  
3.2.1 Scenarios design  
Situations have implications for system design and training (Meister, 1995). In proposed 
system, each event was presented by the both of visual and auditory alarms. A light flashing on the 
screen indicated a visual alarm, and a beeping sound in every half second indicated an auditory 
alarm.    
The measurements, such as time and accuracy are distinguished from other aspects of human 
performance (O’Hara & Hall, 1992). Therefore, the programming of system will record subject’s

the experiment on payment. All the participants have taken the course of Human Factors. Their 
ages ranged from 20 to 30. 
3.2.5 Task 
Each subject attended 2 stages in this experiment, training stage with three training runs and 
test stage. There were four events, two in basic watermark control and two in alternative 
watermark control, in training stage to be manipulated. In the simulation stage, there were six 
events, two in basic watermark control and four in alternative watermark control. In the 
experiment, the order of basic and alternative of operating procedure was randomized across 
participants. 
The tasks include decisions and actions to deal with alarm signals. While an alarm signal is 
“on”, representing that an event has occurred, the operator must judge if such signal is a decision 
or an action task. If the signal is an action task, then the action should be executed according to the 
procedure. If the signal is a decision task, then the operator checks the relevant information before 
the following action.  
3.2.6 Hypotheses 
It was hypothesized that participants using the computerized graphic interface with 
computerized procedures would experience less operation time and fewer operator errors 
compared to those using the computerized graphic interface requiring paper procedure.

different in the AOP. In the EOP, the operation time between training 1 and training 2 (p<0.001) 
and between training 2 and training 3 (p<0.001) were significantly different from each other, but 
between training 3 and simulation, there were no significant difference. Operation time of each 
procedure is decreased gradually (see Figure 6). It is verified that during either the AOP or the EOP 
in computerized graphic interface results in significant training effect.

The results of a repeated measure of ANOVA revealed that no significant neither interaction

errors. The training effect [F (3, 90)=9.6, p<0.001] was significant. The multiple comparison of 
accuracy revealed that training 1 and training 2 either in AOP (p<0.01) or in EOP (p<0.01) was 
significantly different. Number of errors in each step of AOP and EOP were compared as shown in 
Figure 7. In the AOP, the number of errors decreased gradually except simulation stage. In EOP the 
number of errors decreased gradually.  
 25 
4.2 Discussion of Experiment A 
4.2.1 Performance  
The experimental task of the present study included AOP and EOP in the training stages and 
simulation stage. The operation performance can be verified in simulation stage. The results 
indicated that participants has better operation performance on EOP than that on AOP, because the 
operation time of EOP is significantly less than that of AOP both in simulation stage and training 
stages, and the number of errors on EOP was fewer than that on AOP in simulation stage. Compare 
simulation stage with training stages, in AOP, the operation time was reduced, but the number of 
errors was raised. In EOP, the number of errors decreased and the operation time did not increase 
significantly (Please refer to Figures 8 and 9). The reason is that the participants have realized the 
importance of each decision making in EOP while ignore the similar decision process in AOP. The 
AOP is a routine operation, but the EOP is a critical operation. To improve operation performance, 
the importance of both AOP and EOP should be emphasized. Likewise, operation time and 
accuracy should be traded off. Many time effective trade-offs, however, cannot be performed due 
to the lack of design descriptions. The designer must decide which information is important to 
specify and what level of detail specification is needed at certain stages of the design process 
(Howell et al., 1993). Standardization of visual information design can minimize the trade-offs 
problem.  
In NPP, operation error is not allowable, but the numbers of it still exist especially in 
simulation stage in this experiment. Human performance in a human-machine system depends on 
the “external” working environment and the individual’s “internal” state of the mind, and will help 
lessen human error (Nishitani, 1996). Here, the causes of errors in the proposed system may due to 
1) individual differences: different operational strategies result in different performance, e.g. some 
of participants focus on accuracy, but some of them focus on operation efficiency, 2) feedback: if 
 27 
substitutes ”greater than”. 
• Several participants addressed a comment that designer should give careful consideration on 
font type and font size of Chinese characters.

5.1.1 The teamwork system requiring paper procedures 
The framework of the interface requiring paper procedures is shown in Figure 9. The interface 
includes guiding lights, operation buttons, and display of system parameters. Guiding lights that 
display the status (in green), decision (in red), or action (in yellow) components represent the 
alarm signals when an event occurs. The operation buttons include action points and 
decision-making points. When performing a decision-making task, the operator has to diagnose the 
event and determine the appropriate procedure step (up or down through system states) to carry out.

studies of assistance systems for NPPs (Yang & Hwang, 2001; Huang & Hwang, 2003a;b). The 
framework of the computerized procedure interface is shown in Figure 10. This interface includes 
three extra functions: 1) to display key statement of procedure in the upper half interface and 
complete procedure statement in the lower half interface, 2) to show parameters of the related 
system, and 3) to automatically present more detailed information, e.g. graphical system 
parameters, on a window if necessary. The design goals for the proposed system are: 1) to reduce 
operators’ physical/mental workload, 2) to avoid errors that may affect the safety and availability 
of the plant, 3) to improve team performance and interaction, e.g. operation time and accuracy of 
action, and 4) to design simple and consistent monitoring and control functions.

5.2.1.2 Tasks 
During the experiment, participants have to execute decision and action tasks to deal with 
each alarm event, and detection task to find designed system errors out. While an alarm signal is 
“on”, representing an event has occurred, the operator must judge if the signal requires a decision 
or an action task. If the signal requires an action task, then the appropriate action should be 
executed according to the procedure. If the signal requires a decision task, then the operator needs 
to check relevant information before carrying out an action. Meanwhile, once participant detected 
the system error, he/she had to record it on a paper and then kept executing abnormal event on 
present flowchart page.  
5.2.1.3 Apparatus 
Two teamwork systems were described earlier in Section 3. A database management system 
created the situations of each procedure from the pre-established scripts and recorded 
manipulations. Two computers provided graphical interface for each procedure respectively. Each 
operator could execute his or her actions by mouse in their own interface.  
5.2.1.4 Independent variables  
The independent variables were procedure type and experimental stage. Two types of 
procedure interface included a computerized procedure interface and the interface requiring paper 
procedures. There were four levels of experimental stage, training 1, training 2, training 3, and test.

5.2.1.7 Participants 
Thirty graduate students of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management at National 
Tsing Hua University, age 20 to 30 years, were paid to participate in the experiment. None of them 
was familiar with NPP procedures. Participants were asked to join the 3-person team experiment. 
Additionally, for encouraging team cooperate and good feedback on questionnaires during the 
experiment, team incentive plans was adopted. To minimize effects of team differences, teams 
were randomly assigned to each experiment condition.  
 37 
that participants using computerized procedures would spend less operation time, make fewer 
operation errors, and have positive learning effect compared to those using paper procedures.  
5.2.2 Experiment 2 
From the results of Experiment 1, it was shown that using computerized procedures might 
significantly reduce operation time and errors. The subsequent experiment was conducted to 
compare different numbers of operators in the teamwork system providing computerized 
procedures. The run-order, experimental situations, tasks, and experimental procedure in the 
Experiment 2 were the same with the Experiment 3.  
5.2.2.1 Independent variables  
The independent variables were number of operators and experimental stage. Three settings 
of number of operators were used including a single operator, 2 persons, and 3 persons. Four levels 
of experiment stage were used including training 1, training 2, training 3, and test. 
5.2.2.2 Experiment design 
Five single operators and five 2-person teams were created. As to experimental data of five 
3-person teams, the raw data of participants using computerized procedure interface were taken 
from Experiment 3. Different numbers of operators were taken to be a unit of analysis, and the 
mixed factorial design was used. Three types of number of operators were manipulated as a 
between-subjects variable. Experimental stages were set as a within-subjects variable to evaluate 
the training effects. 
5.2.2.3 Participants 
Fifteen graduate students of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management at National 
Tsing Hua University, age 20 to 30 years, were paid to participate in the experiment. They were 
asked to join the 2-person team/signal experiment. Additionally, team incentive plans was adopted. 
They were not familiar with NPP procedures, and randomly assigned to each experimental 
condition to minimize effects of individual/team differences.

6.1.1.2 Operation errors  
The results of ANOVA revealed that main effect of experimental stages (p<0.05) 
was significant on the mean number of errors, but interaction and main effect of types 
of procedure interface were not significant (please refer to Table 6). The results of 
Tukey’s method indicated that number of operation errors between training 1 and 
training 2, either with the computerized procedures or paper procedures, were 
significantly different (p<0.05). The differences between other trials were not 
significant. As shown in Figure 12, the number of errors from training 1 to training 2 
declined significantly with both the interfaces. Moreover, the number of errors when 
using computerized procedures is slightly smaller than that with paper procedures.

6.1.2 Results of experiment 2 
6.1.2.1 Operation performance 
As shown in Table 6, the results of ANOVA on operation time revealed that main effects of 
numbers of operators (p<0.001) and experimental stages (p<0.001) were significant, but 
interaction was not significant. A Tukey’s method indicated that operation time between a single 
operator and 2 persons (p<0.05) and between a single operator and 3 persons (p<0.001) in all trials 
were significantly different. The differences between 2 persons and 3 persons were not significant. 
Multiple comparisons also indicated that operation time between training 1 and training 2 was 
significantly different (p<0.05). In Figure 11, it shows that the operation time of a single operator 
is longer than either 2 or 3 persons and markedly decreased from training 1 to training 2. 
Please refer to Table 6, the results of ANOVA on mean number of errors revealed that main 
effects and interaction were not significant. Regarding the detection performance, the results of a 
Friedman test on mean percentage of detected system errors indicated that main effects and 
interaction were not significant. 
6.1.2.2 Subjective ratings 
A range of Cronbach’s alpha for each question item was from 0.668 to 0.725, which indicates 
the subjective ratings were consistent and stable. As shown in Table 7, the results of K-W test 
indicated that the item of operation skills was significantly different between a single operator and 
2 persons (p<0.05). There were no significant differences on other items between 2 and 3 persons 
although 2 persons rated higher. Additionally, the mean value on operation skills item of 2 persons 
is higher than those of a single operator and 3 persons.

6.2 Discussion of Experiment B 
6.2.1 The teamwork system providing computerized procedures  
In the teamwork system, using the computerized procedure interface resulted in a higher 
operation performance (i.e. less operation time and fewer errors) than using the paper procedure 
interface. However, team performance was not significantly different at detection performance 
when using paper procedures compared with computerized procedures. The advantages and the 
limitations of using the teamwork system providing computerized procedures are discussed in the 
following sections.  
6.2.1.1 Advantages 
The results of experiments revealed that the operators using computerized procedures 
understood how to control the system better as shown by the beneficial training effect on operation 
time and accuracy of action. The results prove that using computerized procedures may effectively 
assist team operators to accomplish complex tasks. In contrast, teams using paper procedures felt it 
difficult to comprehend the semantics of the procedures and the relationships between the 
 47 
operators in real NPP are experienced in computer-based system. Moreover, although the 
experimental situations included AOP and EOP, some EOP states are unforeseen and too 
complicated to be simulated in the proposed system and be understood by novices. Also, the 
accidents/events in this experiment may be recovered successfully as long as operators follow each 
step on the specific procedure. However, some events are recovered by operators based on their 
experiences/knowledge. The experimental results may therefore only be generalized to some 
limited conditions. In order to extend this research into more complex procedure settings, the 
relationships demonstrated on the proposed teamwork system must be further tested. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 49 
numbers of operators in the teamwork system providing computerized procedures, the results 
indicated that 2 persons would be a satisfactory size. Although the computerized procedures have 
been demonstrated to support individual and team performances, we still suggest having paper 
procedures for backup to avoid accidents from the potential computer failure. Likewise, the 
potential automation bias should be considered in system. While these experiments examined NPP 
operation in the simulator, the results may be generalized to similar safety-critical and time-critical 
system domains.
