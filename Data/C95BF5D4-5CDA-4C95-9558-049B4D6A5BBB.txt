1 INTRODUCTION
Advances in wireless communications have increased the popularity of mobile devices and
motivated the development of various mobile applications and services, which are having a
profound effect on people‚Äôs lifestyles. However, reducing the energy consumption of mobile
devices for communications is a major challenge, especially with the rapid growth of data
communications for emerging applications in cloud computing. In recent years, mobile users
have become increasingly addicted to multimedia applications [22], such as video streaming and
IPTV, which are extremely downlink intensive. Such usage behavior leads to significant energy
consumption for data reception [7]. This observation motivates us to study energy-efficient video
multicast in the fourth-generation (4G) wireless systems, such as WiMAX [14] and LTE [1].
The protocols for 4G wireless networks specify the provision of real-time multicast services
to support the delivery of multimedia data to a group of mobile users in an efficient manner. In
a multicast service, multiple users require access to the same video streaming application, and
the base station providing the video content can adaptively change modulation-coding schemes
based on the channel conditions at the user side. This technique, called adaptive modulation and
coding, is employed in most wireless networks. To provide the users with different levels of
video quality, some layer-based video coding techniques, such as scalable video coding (SVC) [11]
and multiple description coding (MDC) [32], which divide a raw video into multiple layers1, have
been developed. However, this system design raises two challenging issues: 1) how to determine
which video layer should be transmitted with which modulation-coding scheme; and 2) how
to allocate appropriate radio resources to transmit the video layers, especially when several
multicast groups are competing for limited resources.
To solve the above issues, a number of studies has been conducted on the resource allocation
problem for video multicast in wireless networks with layer-based coding techniques, e.g.,
[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [10], [16], [17], [23], [25], [30]. The concept of using layer-based video
coding in wireless multicast services was first raised in [3], but only two modulation-coding
schemes were used for data transmission. In recent years, many researchers have focused on the
problem of video multicast with the consideration of both layer-based video coding and adaptive
modulation and coding. As a result, efficient heuristic algorithms have been developed to allocate
limited radio resources to multiple multicast groups (or video sessions) with the purpose of
optimizing various objective functions as system performance metrics. Popular performance
metrics include the peak signal-to-noise ratio [16], the utility function of the number of video
layers received by a user [30], and the utility function of the received application rates [17],
[23], [25]. Several algorithms that incorporate theoretical analysis have also been proposed.
For example, to maximize the utility function of the application rates received by users, a
polynomial-time algorithm with a constant approximation ratio was proposed in [25], and a
pseudo-polynomial time optimal algorithm was presented in [23]. Furthermore, to maximize
the total utility (i.e., all users‚Äô satisfaction), a polynomial-time algorithm was developed in [31],
where the difference in the utility derived by the algorithm and the optimal solution was shown
to be tightly bounded. To protect video layers, some algorithms that exploit forward error correction
techniques have been proposed to maximize the peak signal-to-noise ratio [2], to maximize the
total utility representing the subjective video quality gain of user experiences [5], and to minimize
the video distortion [6], [10]. However, the algorithms do not consider energy consumption of
mobile devices.
The resource allocation problem is further complicated by the need for energy efficiency
which is always a concern in mobile devices. Thus, resource allocation schemes designed for
multicast systems should consider reducing the reception time as a primary objective. Recently,
energy-efficient resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems
1. For ease of presentation, a description of MDC is also called a layer in this project.
1
4G cellular wireless systems employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based
multi-carrier technology. An OFDMA frame consists of symbols in the time domain and sub-
channels2 in the frequency domain, as shown in Figure 1. A symbol and subchannel combination,
referred to as a tile, is the minimum allocable unit that can be modulated and coded individu-
ally3. In a multicast system, the available tiles in a frame are shared by multiple video groups
(and other non-real-time application services [13]), and users requesting the same video simply
join the corresponding group. Consequently, the users in a multicast group may experience
different channel conditions because of the distance to the base station or other factors. In both
WiMAX and LTE, the base station is allowed to adaptively change modulation-coding schemes
(modulation for short) based on the channel conditions at the user side. A user with good
channel conditions (e.g., when close to the base station) can potentially receive the video data at
a higher modulation rate by opting for a higher-rate modulation (such as 64-QAM) or, at least,
a lower-rate modulation (such as QPSK). In contrast, a user with poor channel conditions must
receive the video data at a lower modulation rate in order to tolerate the bit error rate. Because
users report information about their channel conditions, such as signal-to-noise ratios, when
requesting multicast services, the base station is able to determine the appropriate modulation
of the video data provided to each user. In other words, the base station maps, via a certain
modulation, the application rate (kbps) required by users at the application layer to the channel
rate (tiles or specifically tiles per frame) at the physical layer. Note that, given a certain amount
of video data, more tiles are needed to carry it at a lower modulation rate than at a higher rate.
Therefore, the modulation adopted by the base station determines which users can receive a
video and how many tiles are needed to carry it.
If users requesting the same video experience different channel conditions, the following issue
arises. The base station must either adopt a robust modulation to accommodate all the users,
or it must sacrifice the users with poor channel conditions to provide the others with better
video quality. The issue was addressed by introducing layer-based video coding in multicast
services [3], [23], [25]. Layer-based video coding compresses a raw video into several video
layers, and the video quality is progressively refined as the user receives more layers. There are
two popular coding technologies: SVC and MDC. SVC divides a raw video into a base layer and
multiple enhancement layers. The base layer is essential for the reception of video content with
minimal quality, while the enhancement layers progressively improve the video quality. In other
words, an enhancement layer is only effective if the user has received the base layer and all the
other lower enhancement layers. SVC provides a natural means for efficient adaptation of the
video application data rate [26]. However, it is sensitive to the loss of base-layer packets [15] and
relies on some error-resilience mechanisms [27]. In contrast, MDC is capable of error resilience by
design so that layers can be encoded independently (usually with different application rates);
hence decoding one layer does not depend on the other layers. However, redundancies are
inserted intentionally to make the bitstream more resilient to transmission errors [32].
By exploiting layer-based video coding, the base station can apply different modulations to
the layers, so that users receive the video quality appropriate for the channel conditions they
reported initially. Note that an entire layer must use the same modulation and the number of
tiles needed depends on the modulation specified by the base station. Therefore, for an OFDMA
frame, the base station determines which layer of which video should be transmitted with which
modulation. The base station must also determine how to allocate tiles to the layers4. In an
OFDMA-based multicast system, only some symbols in a frame may carry the video layers a user
2. Sub-carriers are usually grouped into subchannels for resource allocation. There are two subchannelization schemes:
contiguous scheme and distributed scheme. The latter, which is recommended for use in multicast systems [25], is considered
in this project.
3. The terminology is mostly based on WiMAX but the concept also applies to LTE [23].
4. The frequency selective effect is usually ignored in OFDM systems [19], [20], [23], [25].

Therefore, Equation (6) ensures that, if layer ‚Ñì is selected to transmit with modulation m, every
layer lower than ‚Ñì must be selected to transmit with a modulation i ‚â§ m.

We now define the energy-efficient layer-coded video multicast (ELVM) problem. Let an OFDMA
frame comprise S ¬∑ C tiles. Let there be M possible modulations and G multicast groups. Each
group g has N gm m-modulation users that require application rate Rgm. The video data for group
g is split into Lg layers, and the application rate of each layer ‚Ñì is Œª(g,‚Ñì). A single tile can carry

5. For ease of presentation, we assume that all the users consume the same amount of energy to receive one symbol. However,
our algorithms are not limited by this assumption. We discuss this issue in Section 5.
5
To complete the proof, we show that two evenly partitioned subsets can be used to derive
a resource allocation whose total energy consumption is no more than n, and vice versa. Since
each subset corresponds to a symbol, and each integer corresponds to the layer for a group,
the assignment of integer ag to a subset implies that the layer for group g occupies ag tiles in
the corresponding symbol. Because every layer is carried in either symbol, every user needs to
receive exactly one symbol. Thus, the total energy consumption is n. On the other hand, if the
total energy consumption is no more than n, then no user can receive two symbols. This implies
that each layer is only carried in one symbol, and the subset can be evenly partitioned by assign-
ing the corresponding integer into the corresponding subset. The existence of a polynomial-time
algorithm for the partition problem implies the same for our problem. We conclude that the
ELVM problem with SVC applied is NP-hard.
3.2 A 2-Approximation Algorithm
3.2.1 Algorithm Description
In this section, we propose a two-stage greedy algorithm and prove that the greedy strategy
yields a 2-approximation algorithm for the ELVM problem with SVC. Stage 1 of the algorithm
determines which video layers for each group should be transmitted with which modulations
in order to satisfy the application rate requirements of all users. In Stage 2, appropriate tiles
are then allocated to the video layers determined in Stage 1, so as to minimize the total energy
consumption for reception.

In Stage 1, as shown in Lines 1-8, an indicator function œá(g,‚Ñì)m shows if layer ‚Ñì for group g is
selected to transmit with modulation m, and is initialized as 0, ‚àÄ g,m, ‚Ñì (Line 1). For each group
g, we find the highest modulation mÀÜ that can be received by all users in the group (Line 3) and
start layer selection from the base layer (Line 4). For the mÀÜ-modulation users, we incrementally
select video layers to transmit with modulation mÀÜ until the application rate requirement of the
users is satisfied (Lines 6-8). We then select video layers from the remainder to transmit with
modulation mÀÜ + 1 to satisfy the (mÀÜ + 1)-modulation users, and so on (Line 5). As a result, if
RgmÀÜ+i ‚â§ RgmÀÜ for any i > 0, then (mÀÜ + i)-modulation users can be satisfied with œÑ gmÀÜ, and the
algorithm will not select any video layer to transmit with modulation mÀÜ+ i.
In Stage 2, as shown in Lines 9-23, we allocate tiles to the video layers selected in Stage 1. An
indicator function œá(g,‚Ñì)(m,s,c) shows if layer ‚Ñì for group g selected to transmit with modulation m
is carried in the tile indexed by symbol s and subchannel c, and is initialized as 0, ‚àÄ g,m, ‚Ñì, s, c

modulation that the user can receive) and one 2-modulation user (i.e., N11 = 1 and N12 = 1),
whose application rate requirements are 5 and 9 kbps respectively (i.e, R11 = 5 and R12 = 9). The
video stream for the group is split into four layers (i.e., L1 = 4), with application rates 1, 2, 3,
and 4 kbps respectively (i.e., Œª(1,‚Ñì) = ‚Ñì, for ‚Ñì = 1, 2, 3, and 4). Let the application rate carried
by a single tile be 2 kbps with modulation 1, and 3 kbps with modulation 2 (i.e., Œ≥1 = 2 and
Œ≥2 = 3). Then, the number of tiles required to carry layer ‚Ñì is t

‚åâ with the modulation scheme 2, for ‚Ñì = 1, 2, 3, and 4. The number
of available symbols and the number of subchannels are both set at 3 (i.e., S = C = 3).
Figure 2(a) shows the result of Stage 1 of Algorithm 1. In this stage, video layers are assigned
to transmit the video with appropriate modulations to satisfy the users‚Äô application-rate require-
ments. There are two users in the group, and the highest-rate modulation that both of them can
receive is modulation 1 (Line 3). Thus, Algorithm 1 starts with the base layer (Line 4) and then
selects video layers incrementally to transmit with modulation 1 until the 1-modulation user
is satisfied (Lines 6-8). Because that user has an application rate requirement of R11 = 5 kbps,
layers 1, 2, and 3, which provide a total application rate of œÑ 11 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 kbps, must be
used to satisfy it. The three layers require ‚åà1

2
‚åâ+ ‚åà3
2
‚åâ = 4 tiles for the transmission because
the application rate carried by a single tile is 2 kbps with modulation 1. Next, the algorithm
attempts to satisfy the 2-modulation user whose application rate requirement is 9 kbps. Because
the three layers transmitted with modulation 1 can also be received by the 2-modulation user,
the latter only needs to receive 9‚àí 6 = 3 kbps. To satisfy the user, the layer-4 stream, which has
an application rate of 4 kbps, is selected for transmission. It requires ‚åà4
3
‚åâ = 2 tiles because the
application rate carried by a single tile is 3 kbps with modulation 2.
Figure 2(b) shows the result of Stage 2 of Algorithm 1, where the tiles determined in Stage
1 are allocated in the frame. The three layers transmitted with modulation 1 require 4 tiles. To
minimize the number of symbols received, Algorithm 1 allocates 4 continuous tiles (starting
from the first symbol) to the three layers in column-major order (Lines 13-22). Because the 4
tiles are scattered in two symbols, the 1-modulation user must consume energy to receive the
two symbols. Then, Algorithm 1 allocates continuous tiles (starting from the first empty tile of
the current symbol) to layer 4, which requires 2 tiles. The two tiles turns out to fully fill the
second symbol. As a result, the 2-modulation user also needs to receive the two symbols. In the
resource allocation determined by the algorithm, the total number of symbols that the two users
receive is four.
3.2.3 The Properties of Algorithm 1
In this section, we analyze the time complexity of Algorithm 1 and prove that it is a 2-approximation
algorithm for solving the ELVM problem with SVC.
Lemma 1: The time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(GMLÀÜSC), where LÀÜ = max
‚àÄ g
Lg.
Proof. Each index combination of the indicator function œá(g,‚Ñì)m is initialized as 0 and updated to
1 only once (if necessary). The time complexity of Stage 1 is obviously dominated by the time
required for the initialization process, i.e., O(GMLÀÜ). Similarly, Stage 2 appears to spend most
of its time initializing the indicator function œá(g,‚Ñì)m,s,c. Therefore, the time complexity of Stage 2
is O(GMLÀÜSC), and the time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the running time of
Stage 2.
Lemma 2: Stage 1 of Algorithm 1 derives the minimum number of tiles required by every user,

Now we compute the total energy consumption of all users for reception in the solution œá(g,‚Ñì)(m,s,c)

4 ENERGY-EFFICIENT MULTIPLE DESCRIPTION VIDEO MULTICAST
In this section, we present some positive and negative results of the ELVM problem when MDC
is applied. First, in Section 4.1, we give a (2‚àíœµ)-inapproximability result. Then, in Section 4.2, we
propose a pseudo-polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm based on dynamic-programming
to resolve the problem.
4.1 A (2‚àí œµ)-Inapproximability Result
Before presenting the solution to the target problem, we show some important properties of
the problem, namely its NP-hardness and inapproximability ratio. We prove the NP-hardness
of the problem by a reduction from the partition problem as well, and show by a gap-reduction
that the problem cannot be approximated in polynomial time with a ratio better than 2, unless
P = NP . Note that the reduction adopted to prove the NP-hardness of SVC can also be applied
to MDC. We adopt a different reduction for MDC because it can be used in the proof of the
(2‚àí œµ)-inapproximability result for MDC, but it cannot be applied to the SVC case.
Lemma 3: The ELVM problem with MDC is NP-hard.
Proof. Given a set of n integers A = {a1, a2, ..., an} of the partition problem, we show how to
construct, in polynomial time, an instance „ÄàS, C, M , G, Lg, N gm, Œ≥m, Œª(g,‚Ñì), Rgm„Äâ of our problem
such that A can be evenly partitioned if and only if there exists a resource allocation whose
total energy consumption is not greater than 1. The construction procedure is as follows: The
available symbols and subchannels are respectively set as S = 2 and C = 1
2
‚àë
ai‚ààA ai. There is
only one modulation (i.e., M = 1). Let us consider one group (i.e., G = 1) in which there is only
one user (i.e., N gm = 1,‚àÄm = 1, g = 1). The video for the group is encoded into n layers (i.e.,
Lg = n,‚àÄg = 1). The application rate of each layer is set as a‚Ñì (i.e., Œª(g,‚Ñì) = a‚Ñì,‚àÄ 1 ‚â§ ‚Ñì ‚â§ n, g = 1),
and the application rate carried by a single tile with the modulation is set as Œ≥m = 1, ‚àÄ m = 1.
Thus, layer ‚Ñì needs a‚Ñì tiles to carry the data (i.e., t
(g,‚Ñì)
m = a‚Ñì,‚àÄ m = 1, 1 ‚â§ ‚Ñì ‚â§ n, g = 1). The
application rate requirement of the only user is set as Rgm =
1

already. Note that because the m-modulation users can also receive the video layers transmitted
for satisfying the m‚Ä≤-modulation users, the remaining requirement of the m-modulation users
is no more than max(0, Rgm ‚àí œÑ gm‚àí1); consequently, 0 ‚â§ r ‚â§ max(0, Rgm ‚àí œÑ gm‚àí1). In addition, we
define œá(g,‚Ñì)0 as 0, ‚àÄg, ‚Ñì, for initialization. We delineate four possible cases of Equation (10):
(1) f gm(‚Ñì, r) is set at 0 for any ‚Ñì ‚â• 0 when r = 0. That is, no remaining requirement needs
to be satisfied.
(2) f gm(‚Ñì, r) is set at ‚àû for any r > 0 when ‚Ñì = 0 or
‚àë‚Ñì
k=1 Œª
(g,k)(1‚àí‚à®m‚àí1i=0 œá(g,k)i ) < r. That
is, there is no layer for transmission, or it is impossible to satisfy requirement r even
if all the available layers 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ ‚Ñì such that ‚à®m‚àí1i=0 œá(g,k)i = 0 are transmitted.
(3) f gm(‚Ñì, r) is set as f gm(‚Ñì‚àí 1, r) if
‚à®m‚àí1
i=0 œá
(g,‚Ñì)
i = 1. That is, layer ‚Ñì has been transmitted with
a certain lower modulation, so that requirement r must be satisfied by using some of
the first ‚Ñì‚àí 1 layers.
(4) Otherwise, to satisfy requirement r, layer ‚Ñì is either transmitted or not transmitted with
modulation m. If ‚Ñì is transmitted, t(g,‚Ñì)m tiles are required to carry layer ‚Ñì, yielding an
application rate Œª(g,‚Ñì). Then, the rest of requirement r, i.e., max(0, r ‚àí Œª(g,‚Ñì)), must be
satisfied with some of the first ‚Ñì‚àí 1 layers. On the other hand, if ‚Ñì is not transmitted,
all of requirement r must be satisfied with some of the first ‚Ñì‚àí 1 layers. Thus, f gm(‚Ñì, r)
is set as the minimum of f gm(‚Ñì‚àí 1,max(0, r ‚àí Œª(g,‚Ñì))) + t(g,‚Ñì)m and f gm(‚Ñì‚àí 1, r).

7: return œá(g,‚Ñì)(m,s,c), ‚àÄ g,m, ‚Ñì, s, c
Based on Equation (10), we can use dynamic programming to compute the solutions bottom
up, as shown in Algorithm 2. First, an indicator function œá(g,‚Ñì)m , indicating whether layer ‚Ñì
for group g is selected to transmit with modulation m, is initialized as 0, ‚àÄ g,m, ‚Ñì (Line 1).
Then, for the m-modulation users in group g, the algorithm maintains a two-dimensional table
f gm[], each entry of which stores the value derived by f gm(‚Ñì, r). In other words, there are GM
two-dimensional tables that are completed in a bottom-up manner. Specifically, the M tables
corresponding to the first group are completed from the table indexed with 1 to the table
indexed with M ; then the M tables corresponding to the second group are completed in the
same manner, and so on (Lines 2-3). Whenever Procedure FILL-TABLE() is invoked, it simply
fills in the corresponding table f gm[] according to Equation (10) (Line 4). Immediately after the
table f gm[] has been completed, Procedure BACK-TRACE() is invoked to select the video layers
for satisfying the m-modulation users in group g by back tracing the table, and sets œá(g,‚Ñì)m as 1
for all the selected layers ‚Ñì (Line 5). Note that œá(g,‚Ñì)m will be referred by Procedure FILL-TABLE()
when filling in table f gm+1[] (refer to Cases 2 and 3 in Equation (10)). Given the selected video
layers, i.e., œá(g,‚Ñì)m = 1, ‚àÄg,m, ‚Ñì, the algorithm allocates tiles to them in the same way as Stage 2
of Algorithm 1 (Line 6), and returns the solution œá(g,‚Ñì)(m,s,c) (Line 7).
Procedure FILL-TABLE() takes g, m, ‚ÑìÀÜ, and rÀÜ as inputs. It stores the values derived based on

4.2.2 A Simple Example
The simple example in Figure 3 depicts the steps of Stage 1 in Algorithm 2, where the same sys-
tem settings considered in Section 3.2.2 are considered for this example as well. Some parameter
settings of each video layer are detailed in Table 2.
Figure 3(a) shows how each entry of table f 11 [] is completed by Procedure FILL-TABLE(). Recall
that each table entry should be read as f gm[‚Ñì, r]. Let us consider some entries that correspond to
each of the four cases in Equation (10). For the first case, f 11 [0, 0] = 0 because r = 0 (Lines 3-4). In
other words, the case only occurs for the entries of the first column in the table. For the second
case, f 11 [0, 1] = ‚àû because ‚Ñì = 0, and f 11 [1, 2] = ‚àû because
‚àë1
k=1 Œª
(1,k)(1 ‚àí ‚à®0i=0 œá(1,k)i ) = 1 < 2
(Lines 5-6). For the third case, there is no entry that corresponds to this case because no layer
has been transmitted with a lower modulation, i.e.,
‚à®0
i=0 œá
(1,‚Ñì)
i = 0, ‚àÄ ‚Ñì (Lines 7-8). This case
will be illustrated by an entry in table f 12 []. For the last case, f 11 [1, 1] = 1 because min(f 11 [0, 0] +
t
(1,1)
1 , f
1
1 [0, 1]) = min(0 + 1,‚àû) = 1, and f 11 [4, 2] = 1 because min(f 11 [3, 0] + t(1,4)1 , f 11 [3, 2]) = min(0 +
2, 1) = 1 (Lines 9-10).
Figure 3(b) shows how Procedure BACK-TABLE() back traces table f 11 [] to select video layers
for transmission. It starts at the last entry f 11 [4, 5] (Lines 1-2). Because layer 4 has not been
transmitted, the procedure determines if the layer should be transmitted (Lines 3-9). If layer 4 is
transmitted, then the first three layers need to provide an application rate of at least r‚àí Œª(1,4) =
5 ‚àí 4 = 1 kbps which requires f 11 [3, 1] tiles. However, with the same number of tiles, the first
three layers can actually provide an application rate up to 2 kbps because f 11 [3, 2] = f 11 [3, 1].
Thus, r‚Ä≤ is set at 2, and an application rate r‚Ä≤ + Œª(1,4)1 = 2 + 4 = 6 kbps can be carried by
f 11 [3, 2] + t
(1,4)
1 = 1 + 2 = 3 tiles. On the other hand, if layer 4 is not transmitted, the 5 kbps
requirement should be satisfied by the first three layers and f 11 [3, 5] = 3 tiles would be required.
Although both cases need the same number of tiles, more application rates can be carried if
layer 4 is transmitted (Line 7). Thus, layer 4 is selected for transmission by setting œá(1,4)1 at 1
(Line 8); and the remaining requirement r is updated to 6 ‚àí 4 = 2 (Line 9) because a rate of 6
15
Proof. We prove this lemma by mathematical induction on the number of video layers. As the
induction basis, ‚Ñì = 0, there is no feasible solution that can satisfy any requirement. Thus, the
number of tiles needed is deemed to be ‚àû, i.e., f gm(0, r) = ‚àû for r ‚â• 1, unless no requirement
needs to be satisfied, i.e., f gm(0, 0) = 0. For the induction hypothesis, suppose that the formula
is always correct for satisfying any requirement r with the first ‚Ñì ‚àí 1 layers. We show that the
formula is also correct for satisfying any requirement r with the first ‚Ñì layers.
If there is no requirement, then the number of tiles needed is 0 regardless of the number of
layers, i.e., f gm(‚Ñì, 0) = 0. Now, let us consider any requirement r Ã∏= 0. If r cannot be satisfied
even if all the available layers are selected for transmission, then the number of tiles needed
is deemed to be ‚àû, i.e., f gm(‚Ñì, r) = ‚àû if
‚àë‚Ñì
k=1 Œª
(g,k)(1 ‚àí ‚à®m‚àí1i=0 œá(g,k)i ) < r. If the satisfaction of r
is possible but layer ‚Ñì has been transmitted with a certain lower modulation, then r must be
satisfied with the other ‚Ñì ‚àí 1 layers, i.e., f gm(‚Ñì, r) = f gm(‚Ñì ‚àí 1, r) if
‚à®m‚àí1
i=0 œá
(g,‚Ñì)
i = 1. Otherwise,
if layer ‚Ñì has not been transmitted yet, we delineate two cases: 1) If layer ‚Ñì is selected for
transmission, then, by the induction hypothesis, the minimum number of tiles required to satisfy
r is f gm(‚Ñì‚àí1,max(0, r‚àíŒª(g,‚Ñì)))+t(g,‚Ñì)m . 2) If ‚Ñì is not selected for transmission, then, by the induction
hypothesis, the minimum number of tiles needed is f gm(‚Ñì ‚àí 1, r). Since ‚Ñì may or may not be
selected for transmission, the minimum number of tiles needed is the smaller of the two numbers.
Lemma 6: Stage 1 of Algorithm 2 derives the minimum number of tiles required by every user,
provided that the requirements of all the users are satisfied.
Proof. We prove this lemma by mathematical induction on the index m of the m-modulation
users. As the induction basis, m = 1, since the remaining requirement of the 1-modulation users
in any group g is equal to the original requirement Rg1, this lemma holds for any 1-modulation
user by Lemma 5. For the induction hypothesis, suppose that this lemma is correct for the (m‚àí1)-
modulation users in any group. We show that the lemma is also correct for the m-modulation
users in any group g.
If the (m‚àí 1)-modulation users have been satisfied, because the m-modulation users can also
receive the application rate œÑ gm‚àí1 for satisfying the (m‚àí 1)-modulation users, the m-modulation
users remaining requirement max(0, Rgm ‚àí œÑ gm‚àí1) that needs to be satisfied. By Lemma 5, the
algorithm derives the minimum number of tiles required to carry the remaining requirement
max(0, Rgm ‚àí œÑ gm‚àí1). In addition, by the induction hypothesis, the number of tiles required to
satisfy the (m ‚àí 1)-modulation users is minimized. Thus, the number of tiles required by the
m-modulation users is also minimized, unless the remaining requirement of the m-modulation
users can be reduced further. That is, there is a feasible layer combination with application rate
œÑ ‚àógm‚àí1 > œÑ
g
m‚àí1 such that œÑ
‚àóg
m‚àí1 can be carried by the same number of tiles as œÑ
g
m‚àí1. Nevertheless,
œÑ ‚àógm‚àí1 must not exist, because Procedure BACK-TRACE() always selects the highest application
rate with the same number of tiles (refer to Lines 4-6 of the procedure). Thus, this lemma also
holds for any m-modulation user.
Theorem 4: Algorithm 2 is a pseudo-polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm for the ELVM
problem with MDC.
Proof. Based on Lemmas 4 and 6, this theorem can be proved in a similar way to Theorem 2.

Fig. 4. The application rate of each layer (a) SVC (b) MDC
distribution. However, the stage-1 operation that selects video layers and their corresponding
modulations is not defined in [20]. Thus, in addition to the uniform tile allocation, the CONV
approach includes the stage-1 operations of Algo 1 and Algo 2 for SVC and MDC, respectively.
The parameter settings used in the simulation model are based on the IEEE 802.16m system
description document for a 10MHz spectrum in 3.5 GHz range. The number of available sym-
bols6 [14] is set at 60; each symbol time is 91.429 ¬µs; and the number of available subchannels
varies from 6 to 15. Table 3 details some important PHY and MAC parameters [23]. The energy
consumption in the receive mode per second is set at 1.05 watt, which was measured from the
Android phone of HTC Magic [12] with a Qualcomm RTR6285 RF transceiver. Thus, the amount
of energy consumed for receiving one symbol is 96 ¬µJ.
We use five standard video test sequences: Akiyo, Carphone, Container, Mother-and-Daughter,
and News, all of which are at QCIF resolution and can be downloaded from [29]. Each group
randomly selects a test sequence. For SVC, the video sequences are encoded by using the
extension of H.264/MPEG4-AVC [11] with JSVM, version 9.12.2. Meanwhile, the video sequences
for MDC are split into a number of temporary layers [9], [15], each of which is encoded by H.264
[8] with JM, version 17.1. The maximum number of layers is set at 6, and the video application
6. In the IEEE 802.16m superframe structure comprised of four 5ms frames, there are approximately 120 downlink symbols
and 16 subchannels, depending on the parameter settings in the physical layer [14]. In practical systems, besides multicast
services, downlink resources are shared by other applications [23], such as FTP and HTTP.

Fig. 5. Impact of the number of multicast groups on the total energy consumption under (a) SVC
and (b) MDC
6.2 Simulation Results
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the impact of the number of multicast groups on the total energy
consumption under SVC and MDC respectively. As expected, in both cases, the total energy
consumption increases as the number of groups increases. This is because more groups result
in more multicast service requests, so the base station has to allocate more tiles, which occupy
more symbols for multicast data transmissions. However, the proposed algorithms are much
more energy-efficient than CONV when the number of multicast groups is large. In other words,
in terms of energy efficiency, Algo 1 and Algo 2 are more effective than CONV as the network
size increases. We have to point out that if there is only one multicast group, the total energy
consumption of Algo 1 and Algo 2 is the same as that of OPT since the proposed algorithms
can be proved to be optimal algorithms for a network system comprised of one single multicast
group. Even for the case where the number of multicast groups is larger than 1, the performance
of the proposed algorithms is close to that of OPT. The results also show that the performance
of Algo 1 and Algo 2 is closer to that of OPT in the case of 6 subchannels than in the case of
15 subchannels. The reason for this phenomenon is that OPT has more selections to allocate the
tiles for each group when there are more subchannels in a symbol.
Figures 6(a) and 6(b) illustrate the impact of the number of available subchannels in a symbol
on the total energy consumption under SVC and MDC respectively. Both figures show that
under Algo 1, Algo 2, and OPT, the total energy consumption decreases as the number of
subchannels increases. This is because more subchannels result in less symbols received by each
user. In contrast, the number of available subchannels does not have a significant impact on the
performance of CONV, because it allocates radio resources uniformly without considering the
energy consumption. Moreover, under Algo 1, Algo 2, and OPT, the decrease in the total energy
consumption is more obvious in the case of 20 groups than in the case of 8 groups. The reason
is that, as the number of subchannels increases, the number of received symbols decreases; and
the more groups in the network, the more obvious reduction in the total number of symbols
received. The figures show that Algo 1 and Algo 2 are more effective than CONV when a symbol
contains more subchannels.
Figures 7(b) and 7(a) show the impact of different user distributions on the total energy
consumption under SVC and MDC respectively. In both cases, the energy consumption under
the near user distribution is less than that under the other user distributions. This result is
21
that of Algo 2 for MDC. The reason for this phenomenon is that both algorithms derive the
minimum number of tiles required to satisfy the user requirements and then adopt the same
approach in the tile allocation to minimize the total energy consumption for data reception. In
general, the total energy consumption is slightly more under Algo 1 than under Algo 2. This is
because the solution derived by Algo 1 for SVC is subject to the layer-dependence constraint,
while the solution derived by Algo 2 for MDC is not. Thus, Algo 1 normally uses more tiles
to satisfy the given user requirements. The difference in the performance of Algo 1 and Algo
2 would be more obvious when data loss in wireless channels is considered, because SVC is
sensitive to packet loss and more retransmissions would be required. However, this does not
imply that MDC is always more energy-efficient than SVC. The redundancy added for error
resilience for MDC would lead to additional energy consumption.
7 CONCLUSION
In this project, we have studied the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in 4G wireless
networks with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of all users when they
receive video multicast data. The most well-known techniques for implementing layer-coded
video are scalable video coding (SVC) and multiple description coding (MDC). We prove that
the problem is NP-hard for both SVC and MDC. First, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm
for the problem with SVC. Then, we show that, unless P = NP , the problem with MDC cannot be
approximated in polynomial time with a ratio better than 2, and propose a pseudo-polynomial
time 2-approximation algorithm to solve the problem. The results of simulation demonstrate
that the proposed algorithms are very effective in reducing energy consumption, compared
to a conventional approach. They can also obtain a feasible solution more efficient than an
optimal algorithm with brute-force search. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is more
evident in large-scale networks and when the symbols available for multicast services contain
more subchannels.
