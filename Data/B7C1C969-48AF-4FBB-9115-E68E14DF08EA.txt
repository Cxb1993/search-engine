Abstract 
Due to the growing pressure of global competition 
and increasing customer demands, working across 
corporate boundaries to collaboratively develop new 
products has become the operative model for R&D in 
a wide range of industries.  However, complex 
interaction patterns between components and activities 
make frequent occurrences of unanticipated iterations 
that may lead to late time-to-market.  Therefore, 
managing the design chain process create new 
challenges for the project manager.  In this research, 
the design chain process is considered as a 
performance-oriented discrete-event dynamic system.  
An overlapping process model is proposed to analyze 
the impact of process structure on the lead-time of a 
complex development project, where an activity may 
be responsible by different collaborating enterprises.  
Information evolution and change sensitivity, which 
are two major factors for activity overlapping, are 
considered in the proposed model and a simulation 
algorithm is developed to analyze the impacts of 
process structure on the development lead-time.  The 
example of a battle tank simulator project is used to 
illustrate the proposed approach.  The computational 
experiment shows that the proposed approach allows 
project managers to design a better process structure 
to minimize the risk of being late-to-market.

二、緣由與目的 
 
Due to the growing pressure of global 
competition and increasing customer demands, 
working across corporate boundaries to 
collaboratively develop new products has become the 
operative model for R&D in a wide range of 
industries.  Unlike manufacturing processes, product 
development is a creative and discovery process that 
intends to create something new from trial-and-error 
and learning from the errors made to overcome 
technical and market uncertainties.  However, 
complex interaction patterns between components and 
activities make frequent occurrences of unanticipated 
iterations that may lead to late time-to-market.  
Managing the design chain process create new 
challenges for the project manager, because the work, 
processes, and coordination styles of collaborating 
enterprises involved in a collaborative product 
development (CPD) project are inherently diverse and 
may make unanticipated iterations uncontrollable.  
Improper management of the design chain process 
will have a larger impact on total project results.   
Due to shortening product life cycles, there is 
increasing pressure to reduce product development 
time and cost and maintain high product quality.  
Faster time-to-market for new products can lead to 
premium pricing and higher sales volume.  Therefore, 
it is important to streamline product development 
processes to accelerate development projects [10, 13]. 
A modern product development process usually 
consists of hundreds or thousands of activities, where 
the activities may be dependent or interdependent with 
each other.  Unlike the manufacturing processes, 
product development is a creative and discovery 
process that intends to create something new from 
trial-and-error and learning from the errors made.

information from j and activity j also needs 
information from i, then the activities i and j are 
interdependent, and any modification made by any of 
the two activities will cause rework in another 
activity.  
This research represents the information 
dependencies between development activities by a 
design structured matrix (DSM, [6]).  A DSM ([aij]) 
is a square matrix in which a cell on the diagonal 
represents each development activity.  A mark in an 
off-diagonal cell (j, i) indicates that there is an 
information dependency between activities i and j and 
activity j requires input information from activity i.  
When activities are listed in temporal order, 
sub-diagonal marks indicate that the information from 
upstream activities feed forward to downstream 
activities, while super-diagonal marks indicates 
feedback information or iterations from downstream 
activities to upstream activities for design 
modifications due to inability to meet the target 
product requirements or some design flaws detected in 
downstream stages.   
It is generally accepted that an improper process 
structure of a development project will increase 
ineffective iterations that result in longer development 
lead-time.  Therefore, it is important to determine an 
appropriate process structure and effectively manage 
iterations to reduce the lead-time of a product 
development project.  Therefore, to analyze the 
impact of iterations on the entire development process, 
it is necessary to provide rework probability pji and 
impact qji of activity j caused by a typical change in its 
input from activity i.  Since a design change may has 
different impact levels and it is difficult to estimate 
accurately, this research represents the amount of 
rework qji by the triangular distribution.  
 
3.3. An Overlapping Process Model for New 
Product Development 
A basic overlapping process model for two 
development activities that may be either dependent or 
interdependent is presented next.  Let di, dj be the 
nominal duration of activities i and j and oji be the 
overlapping period between activities i and j (Figure 
1).  Downstream activity j can be started when the 
preliminary information from upstream activity i has 
been received.  As the finalized design information is 
released from activity i, activity j still has to be 
reworked to accommodate the required design 
modification.  The duration of the required rework is 
dependent on the evolution speed of upstream activity 
and the sensitivity of downstream activity to the 
design changes received from its upstream activity 
and can be calculated as: 
dj0 = (dj – oji) + (1 – p) × τji (2) 
where τji is the amount of rework of activity j required 
to accommodate design changes from upstream 
activity i and its value is generated from a triangular 
distribution Γji.   
If activities i and j are interdependent, then the 
subsequent sequential iterations may occur, because 
the modifications from any activity may have impacts 
on another activity (Figure 1).  The probability of 
rework for activity j caused by activity i is described 
by pji.  A random number γ ∈ [0, 1] is generated, and 
if γ ≤pji then an upstream iteration occurs and its 
duration of rework τji is generated by a triangular 
distribution Γji.  Similarly, upstream activity i may 
have an impact on downstream activity j and the 
above procedure is used to determine whether the 
downstream iteration will occur.  The same process 
is continued until no iteration takes place.

Figure 1. Basic process model for two activities 
 
Based on the basic process model, a 
discrete-event simulation algorithm is developed in 
this paper to estimate the probability distribution of 
development lead-time of a product development 
project with multiple activities.  Please refer to Wang 
and Lin [21] for the details of the simulation 
algorithm. 
 
 
五、結果與討論 
 
Computational experiments were performed to 
show the feasibility of the proposed approach.  A 
new battle tank simulator project with seventeen 
major activities from a research institute is used to 
illustrate the developed concept.  Please refer to 
Wang and Lin for the required input data.  Assume 
that the target project duration is set to 78 weeks.  
The purpose of simulation is to estimate the 
probability distribution of development lead-time and 
the risk of being late-to-market.  Three scenarios 
with different process structures were developed to 
examine the effect of activity overlapping on the 
development lead-time.  Pilot experiments were 
performed to determine how many simulation runs 
were adequate to obtain stable results.  The number 
of simulation runs was set to 1000 in order to obtain a 
stable probability distribution of development 
lead-time.   
Scenario 1 did not apply the activity 
overlapping strategy.  The obtained probability 
distribution is shown in Figure 2 and its mean and 
standard deviation are 95.03 and 42.88 (in weeks), 
respectively.  We can have 95% confidence that the 
true mean of lead-time is somewhat between 92.37 
and 97.69 (Table 1).  Due to the iteration effects, the 
distribution is right-skewed.  Therefore, the 
distribution mean may be not a good metric to 
evaluate the risk of a late project.  In this research,
