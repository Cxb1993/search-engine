The 22 conduction band, 44 hole band, and 22 spin-orbit split-off band matrices of
zincblende semiconductors are obtained by using a block diagonal technique. Importantly, the block
diagonal matrices incorporate not only the interband coupling effect but also the bulk inversion
asymmetry effect. Analytical expressions for the conduction band spin-splitting energies of GaAs
zincblende bulk and quantum wells grown on 001-, 111-, and 110-oriented substrates are
formulated by solving the block diagonal matrices. The results show that odd-in-k terms exist in
both the bulk and the quantum well expressions due to the bulk inversion asymmetry effect. The
presence of these terms is shown to induce the spin-splitting phenomenon. Â© 2008 American

I. INTRODUCTION
The fine details of the electronic structures of semicon-
ductors and their heterostructures are well understood. How-
ever, an increasing interest in the hyperfine details of these
structures, such as their spin-splitting characteristics, for in-
stance, has led to the emergence of a new research field
known as spintronics.1â€“5 The electron states in a crystal are
known to be doubly degenerate if the system has both time
reversal and space inversion symmetries. However, the spin
degeneracy property is lost under the application of an exter-
nal magnetic field since the time reversal symmetry is
destroyed.6 Furthermore, the lack of inversion symmetry due
to the crystalline structure itself or due to the application of
an external force field e.g., strain, electric field, and struc-
tural confinement may also result in the loss of spin
degeneracy.7,8
The loss of spin degeneracy in semiconductor hetero-
structures in the zero-field condition has attracted consider-
able attention in the spintronics field. It is believed that zero-
field spin splitting may be induced by one of two different
mechanisms, namely, i a k3 term in the conduction and
valence band expressions related to microscopic inversion
asymmetry generally referred to as the Dresselhaus effect
or ii an interfacial spin-orbit interaction term referred to as
the Rashba effect.9,10 The purpose this study is to analyze
the k3 term to formulate its analytical mathematical forms for
zincblende bulk and quantum wells QWs oriented along
different growth directions, respectively.
Zincblende semiconductors exhibit an intrinsic spin-
splitting effect as a result of the inversion asymmetry of their
microscopic crystal potential. Consequently, the valence
band structure may include a linear-in-k term, which is asso-
ciated with the Kane C parameter.11 However, calculations
by Cardona et al.12 showed that the resulting splitting effect
is extremely small. In addition, a cubic-in-k k3 term, which
is associated with the Kane B parameter denoted as B0 in
this paper and potentially is of significant magnitude, may
appear in both the conduction band and the valence band
structures.11 Splitting effects have also been observed in
spin-polarized photoemission and infrared spin
resonance.
13,14 By neglecting the linear-in-k C parameter
term, i.e., by considering only the cubic-in-k B parameter
term, this paper derives analytical expressions for the spin-
splitting effect as a function of the components of the wave
vector k in GaAs zincblende bulk and GaAs QWs grown on
001-, 111- and 110-oriented substrates.
In the adopted approach, the rotation technique is ap-
plied to the 88 k Â·p Hamiltonian matrix of bulk zincblende
semiconductors.15,16 The conduction band and valence bands
are then decoupled by applying the block diagonal technique
to the rotated 88 Hamiltonian matrix.17 The resulting 2
2 conduction Hamiltonian matrix along arbitrary k direc-
tions is then solved to obtain analytical expressions for the
spin splitting of the conduction band.

From Eqs. 15aâ€“15c, 16, and 17, the conduction

width and z is the electron envelope function in the well

c
. It is observed that these expressions contain both
linear-in-k and cubic-in-k terms for k. In the following cal-
culations, it is shown that the spin-splitting energies linearly
cubically depend on in-plane wave vectors k relative to the
small large quantized kz vector.
Figures 2aâ€“2c show the spin-splitting energies of the
first conduction subband of 001-, 111-, and 110-grown
GaAs QWs, respectively, as a function of the direction of k.
Note that the well width is L=200 Ã… in every case and k
has a magnitude of 0.052 /a. When the QW has a wide
well width and k has a substantial magnitude, the interband
mixing effect is strong; thus, Figs. 2aâ€“2c show evidence
of a band warping phenomenon in the conduction subbands.
Furthermore, it is evident that the in-plane spin-splitting pat-
terns strongly depend on the growth direction of the QW.
Specifically, the in-plane spin-splitting patterns for the
001-, 111-, and 110-grown QWs are strongly aniso-
tropic with fourfold, sixfold, and twofold symmetries, re-
spectively. Importantly, the axes of the in-plane patterns lie
along the directions of the tetragonal bonds projected on the
layer plane. As a result, the anisotropic spin-splitting phe-
nomenon is strongly affected by the anisotropy of the geo-
metrical arrangement of the tetragonal bonds.
Figures 3aâ€“3c show the in-plane spin-splitting pat-
terns for QWs of well width L=50 Ã… that are grown along
the 001, 111, and 110 directions, respectively. Note that
the magnitude of the wave vector is k=0.052 /a in every
case. By comparing Figs. 2 and 3, it is seen that the spin-
splitting pattern is strongly dependent on the QW width. For
the case wherein the QW has a high well width and the wave
vector has a substantial magnitude Fig. 2, the in-plane spin-
splitting pattern closely resembles that of the bulk material
calculated in Sec. III B 2. Furthermore, in Eqs. 22aâ€“22c,
the coefficients of the 	kz
2 0 terms, which cubically depend
on the wave vector k, are the same as those in Eqs.
20aâ€“20c. However, in the small-well-width QW case
