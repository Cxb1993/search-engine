Abstract 
This report presents a compact microstirp Wilkinson 3-dB power divider with third 
harmonic suppression. Two equivalent T-shaped lines are designed to replace the two 
quarter-wavelength lines of the conventional power divider. The equivalent lines achieve the 
same fundamental responses of the conventional lines while the equivalent lines are 
bandstop filters at the third harmonic frequency to suppress the third harmonic signals. A 
47-dB third harmonic suppression is achieved. Furthermore, the proposed power divider is 
compact and achieves 16% size reduction in comparison to the conventional power divider. 
 
Keywords: bandstop filter, harmonic suppression, power divider. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Wilkinson power divider was first introduced by Wilkinson [1] and has been an essential 
component for RF/microwave array antennas. Since its configuration is symmetrical, a Wilkinson 
power divider can be analyzed by using even- and odd-mode technique [2], [3]. Most of the 
researches focus on how to miniaturize the Wilkinson power divider and how to make it suitable 
for dual-band or wideband applications. The power divider using lumped elements can achieve a 
compact circuit size [4], [5]. On the other hand, the power divider with three-dimensional 
structure can achieve a compact size [6]. In recent years, the attention on dual-band power 
dividers is growing. They can be implemented by using stepped-impedance resonator [7] or 
two-section transmission line [8]. Furthermore, the power divider using multi-section 
transmission line [9], [10] or composite left-/right-handed transmission line [11] can achieve a 
wide bandwidth. 
Unfortunately, for a power divider, suppression of the harmonic signals that could interfere 
with other nearby equipments is rarely studied. In order to eliminate the harmonic signals of a 
power divider, one can use an additional bandstop filter to suppress the specific harmonic signals 
[12]. But this would also increase the passband insertion loss, cost, circuit size, and circuit 
complexity. Furthermore, the defected ground structure requires a double-side fabrication that 
makes the repeatability difficult to maintain. By introducing an additional shunt inductor at the 
output ports and two shunt open stubs in the centers of the two quarter-wavelength branches, the 
power divider achieves nth harmonic suppression [13]. However, lumped inductors are not easy to 
 3
that there is another passband at the third harmonic frequency of 5.6 GHz. On the other hand, Fig. 
6 shows the simulated and measured results of the proposed power divider as well as the 
photograph of the final circuit. Refer to Fig. 1(b), the parameters are L2 = 9.9 mm, W2 = 0.5 mm, 
r1 = 8.4 mm, W1 = 0.5 mm, and R = 100 ohm. From 1.3 to 2.3 GHz, the measured input return 
loss is better than 15 dB and the insertion loss is less than 3.5 dB. The output return loss is better 
than 22 dB and the isolation between the two output ports is better than 15 dB. As expected, the 
third harmonic signal is suppressed and the suppressed level at the third harmonic of 5.6 GHz is 
50 dB. Fig. 7 compares the measured results of the conventional and proposed power dividers. 
They show similar fundamental responses while the proposed power divider achieves a 47-dB 
suppression improvement at the third harmonic frequency of 5.6 GHz. Furthermore, since the 
mean radius of the conventional power divider is 9.45 mm and that of the proposed power divider 
is 8.65 mm, the proposed power divider achieves a 16 % size reduction in comparison to the 
conventional power divider. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
An improved Wilkinson power divider with the third harmonic suppression is proposed. The 
equivalent T-shaped microstrip line shows the same fundamental response with the 
quarter-wavelength microstrip lines of the conventional power divider and acts as a bandstop 
filter at the third harmonic frequency. The design curves derived from a transmission line model 
are given for the equivalent T-shaped microstrip line. In comparison to the conventional power 
divider, the proposed power divider not only achieves a 16 % size reduction but also a 47-dB 
suppression at the third harmonic frequency.

transformer could be used if necessary. In this paper, the quarter-wave impedance transformer is 
eliminated. Instead, the distance between the reflector and the microstrip ground plane (D1) is 
optimized for impedance matching. The parameters of the Yagi-Uda antenna are obtained by 
looking up the design table for cylindrical-wire antenna first [9], and then scaling the lengths and 
widths for the proposed antenna [10]. From the design table for d/λ =0.0085: the length of the 
director is 0.43λ , the length of the driven element is 0.5λ , the length of the reflector is 0.48λ , and 
the distance between the elements is 0.2λ , where d is the diameter of the cylindrical wire and λ  
is the free-space wavelength. To implement the Yagi-Uda antenna on a dielectric substrate, the 
widths of each element are obtained by using the scaling equation Wd = 2d, and the guided 
wavelength is used to replace the free-space wavelength in the design table. The antenna is built on 
a 20-mil RT/Duroid 5870 substrate with a relative dielectric constant of 2.2. When the center 
frequency is 10 GHz, the parameters of the antenna are: Lref =13.07 mm, Ldri=13.73 mm, Ldir=11.67 
mm, D1=5.05 mm, D2=5.2 mm, Wd=0.5 mm, Wm=1.6 mm for a 50-ohm line, the angle=60o and 
radius=5 mm of the radial stub, and the gap of the coplanar stripline is 0.2 mm considering the 
resolution of the etching process. The distance D1 from the microstrip truncated ground to the 
reflector is optimized as 5.1 mm such that Zin=50 ohm at 10 GHz. Therefore, the additional 
microstrip quarter-wave impedance transformer in [8] is eliminated to save the circuit area. 
III. Simulated and Measured Results 
 The photograph of the final antenna is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows the simulated and 
measured S parameters of the antenna. The simulation is carried out by the electromagnetic 
simulator IE3D [11] to take all the discontinuities into consideration. The simulated result shows a 
good agreement with the measured result. The 10-dB bandwidth is 1 % with the center frequency of 
10 GHz. Fig. 4 shows the measured antenna patterns at 10 GHz. The antenna achieves a high 10.5 
dBi antenna gain and a 15-dB front-to-back ratio. The cross-polarization level is more than 22 dB 
below the co-polarization level.   
IV. Conclusions 
 A 10-GHz planar microstrip-coplanar stripline-fed Yagi-Uda antenna is presented. The antenna 
achieves an end-fire pattern with a high 10.5 dBi gain and a 15-dB front-to-back ratio. The planar 
antenna is easy to integrate with other solid-state components. This antenna should find many 
applications in microwave systems.
