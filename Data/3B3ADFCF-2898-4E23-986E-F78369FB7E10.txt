21. Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is a respiratory disorder occurring
during sleep. Patients suffering OSA hold their breath more than ten seconds during
sleep, and then take more efforts to breathe out in order to overcome the partial or
total collapse of upper airway. Depression of deep sleep made patients feel sleepy in
the daytime. Besides, OSA is also associated with cardiovascular disease, including
hypertension [1], coronary artery disease, which makes OSA become the most
physiologic disruptive and dangerous sleep-related diseases. Previous study showed
that as many as 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women suffering
OSA [2]
The gold standard approach to diagnosis of OSA is with an in-laboratory,
technician-attended full polysomnography (PSG), but it’s alabor-intensive, expensive
tool. PSG is not widely distributed and a complete PSG diagnosis takes a
time-consuming overnight sleep monitoring. To be worst, there are so many demands
on the overnight PSG examination that it usually takes patients three to six months to
be on the waiting list. Night to night variability of sleep state is another drawback of
PSG. Therefore an alternative approach, such as portable monitoring for home
diagnosis with less measurement variables, is increasingly needed. Numerous
researches have devoted to developing portable OSA diagnosis system. According to
4stage 4 and non-REM sleep, the total HRV spectrum power was significantly higher
in REM sleep and its value gradually increased in the course of each REM cycle. The
value of the VLF component was significantly higher in REM sleep than in stages 2
and 4 of non-REM sleep. The LF spectral component was significantly higher in
REM sleep than in stages 2 to 4 non-REM sleep [9]. Drinnan developed visual
analysis of the single HRV spectrum and led to a correct classification score of 28/30
(93%) [10]. Recently, Heneghan also developed an automated OSA classification
algorithm used 92 subjects with AHI thresholds below 5 and greater than 15. The
automated algorithm achieved positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.16 and 0.08
[11]. Mendez [12] applied time-frequency analysis methods, such as smooth pseudo
Wigner-Ville, Choi-Williams and Born-Jordan distribution to analyze the heart rate
variability during arousal from sleep. They found that during arousal episodes,
analogous energy distribution and spectral indexes were obtained by the three
time-frequency representations. There were still abundant researches about HRV and
cardio-respiration variables used to estimate the sleep state of OSA patients [13]-[15].
Besides searching for optimal signal variables, a wireless transmission system is
also important for portable PSG system. In this study, we adopted Bluetooth
embedded PDA system. Bluetooth had been widely applied to physiologic signal
measurement system [16]-[17]. Lee [18] had integrated Bluetooth communication

(3) Extract time domain and frequency domain HRV features. That includes mean
heart rate, RMSSD, SDNN, LF and HF power [21]-[22]. Sub-band HRV spectrum
powers with 0.02 Hz interval was also estimated as features.
(4) Statistical testing between OSA and control groups was performed by t-test
analysis.
(5) K-means clustering was applied with two cluster number.
(6) Clustering performance was judged by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve.
All the above OSA identification algorithms were implemented by MATLAB, and
coded with the Labview into PDA module. The detail processing information is in the
following section.
2.2.1 ECG processing
Overnight ECG and corresponding ECG features were used in this study, that
include RR interval, SDNN, RMSSD, SDSD, power of LF and power of HF.
Following 1024-point FFT was applied to the HRV signal with normalization and
re-sampling of 4 Hz. Spectrum features are obtained in some frequency range. Low
frequency (LF) range is 0.04-0.15 Hz, and high frequency range (HF) is 0.15-0.40 Hz.
The ECG parameters used in this study are listed in the following:
8Sensitivity = TP/ (TP+FN)
And specificity is the ability to recognize negative subjects, defined as
Specificity = TN/ (TN+FP)
The definition of TP, FN, TN and FP are listed below. In this study, positive
group is high RDI subjects and negative group is low RDI subjects.
(a) True positive (TP): number of subjects marked as positive by both the doctor and
machine expert system.
(b) True negative (TN): number of subjects marked as negative by both the doctor and
machine expert system.
(c) False positive (FP): number of subjects marked as positive by machine expert
system only.
(d) False negative (FN): number of subjects marked as negative by machine expert
system only.
Optimal decision function is the trade off between sensitivity and specificity.
Traditional the curve of the ROC is chosen as the trade-off and also used in our study.
10
sub-band LF powers, especially frequency from 0.02 to 0.06 Hz also is higher for
high RDI subjects. Statistical testing between high RDI and low RDI groups was also
estimated, and their p-value is listed on the last column of table 1.
3.2 ROC curves
Five HRV parameters were chosen for further examination: heart rate (BPM),
absolute LF power (pLF), LF percentage (ALF), first LF sub-band power (LF1) and
second LF sub-band power (LF2). These five parameters are statistically significant to
distinguish high RDI from low RDI group (p<0.05). In order to examine what is the
optimal feature combination from these five features, there was a thorough
step-by-step check, from single feature, two features to three features. All possible
feature combinations were listed in the first column of table 2.
K-means clustering with k=2 was then applied to the features according to the
description in section 2.2.2. Each decision function determined the clustering result
and the clustering performance were evaluated as sensitivity and specificity pairs.
New decision function was parallel with original decision function, and new
clustering result was obtained. Complete ROC curve was established after thorough
feature investigation. Each feature combination had one corresponding ROC curve.
Figure 3 is illustration of a two-element feature distribution which is composed by
LF1 and LF2. A clear illustration is shown how to determine the original cluster

4. Discussion
Portable monitoring for OSA patients is an attractive and hot topic in these days.
ECG is one of the methods chosen for its easy accessibility and implementation for
home based OSA monitoring. Low cost, low power demand, easy to setup and
friendly user interface are major factors to be considered to home based OSA
monitoring. Such system is especially useful for the primary screening on OSA
candidate and for further traces after OSA treatment.
This article has several contributions on this topic. The first is to propose a simple
and easy implementation ECG features to discriminate OSA candidates. There were
many ECG features investigated for OSA, such as the traditional time domain,
frequency domain, nonlinear parameters, and their sophisticated features
combinations. There ECG derived features combined with highly computation load
expert system, like artificial network or fuzzy system as described in the introduction
section, as a complete OSA diagnosis system. However, this article proposed several
ECG derived features that are rather attractive than previous studies.
From table 1 and table 2, ECG derived features with lower t-test p value and
higher sensitivity and specificity pairs are treat as better features for OSA
classification. Time domain parameter, BPM, has p value 0.044 and clustering
sensitivity and specificity pairs (0.6552, 0.5667). BPM behaved less than other
14
ALF) and (LF2, LF1, BPM) with the same specificity and specificity result with
single LF1. Due to above discussion, LF1 was chosen as classification feature.
Sub-band LF spectrum has good performance to OSA discrimination, which had
been investigated in the pervious study [24]. This article also finds that HRV
frequency power between 0.02-0.04 Hz is rather attractive. Single frequency domain
feature with low computation load is good for clinical usage of home case based OSA
screening.
LF1 has 100% specificity and 68.97% sensitivity. Specificity is ability to detect
TN group, in other word, LF1 can detect low RDI OSA group with 100% accuracy if
the classification system claim that user’s sleep is low RDI; on the other hand,
68.97% sensitivity means if the classification system claim high RDI, there are only
68.97% users really belonging to high RDI group. In this study, 60 subjects were used
to test the LF1 performance. More data, such as those in the Physionet data base,
should be used to further investigate the applicability of LF1.
The second contribution of this study was to classify RDI group by overnight
ECG instead of minute-to-minute ECG features to identify OSA. Due to the focus of
this study is on a home-base monitoring of OSA, overnight ECG is easier to be
implemented and to achieve this goal.
The third approach was to classify RDI with two groups instead of estimation of
16
implemented OSA screening system is a good choice for low cost and fast
implementation requirement.
