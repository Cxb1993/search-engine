and the host rock, the disposal spacing, and the thickness of the host rock at a final 
spent-nuclear-fuel repository.  The results can be used to design the repository site

goals.  Chang et al. (2005) investigated the heat transfer effects due to the deep 
geologic repositories, designed by the Taiwan Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, 
for a spent nuclear fuel.  The effects of the influent factors from the in-situ material 
responses, including the buffer material and thermal gap, were assessed using the 
finite element modeling.  Their result showed that only the 8 × 40 m2 case conforms 
to the standard of the low-temperature disposal site (less 100 0C; KBS, 1999, JNC, 
2000).  Chijimatsu et al. (2005) studied the thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) 
effects numerically on the near-field safety of a hypothetical nuclear waste repository 
within the international DECOVALEX III project.  The project was to perform an 
in-situ THM experiment at Kamaishi mine in Japan.  Their experiment used a 
simplified axisymmetric model with the temperature at the centre of the heater 
maintained at 100 0C during a heating phase of 258 days and then turned off the 
natural cooling phase for approximately 180 days.  Sizgek (2005) developed a 
three-dimensional thermal model to investigate the temperature distribution in one of 
the boreholes of a hypothetical tunnel for a basic geometrical setting as well as the 
effect of varying the distance between adjacent boreholes and the distance between 
adjacent tunnels.  Their result showed that decreasing the spacing between the 
canisters had a larger effect on the temperature distribution than decreasing the 
spacing between the tunnels.  Blaheta et al. (2007) investigated the efficiency of the

canister is surrounded by the buffer within a finite radius disposal borehole; (3) the 
initial temperature is constant and uniformly distributed throughout the whole 
repository site; (4) the physical parameters and thermal properties of the buffer and 
the rock are constant in space and time; (5) the lower and upper boundaries of the host 
rock consist of fractures and no heat is transferred in the fractures; (6) the values of 
physical parameters and thermal property of the backfill material in an emplacement 
tunnel are the same as those in the host rock; (7) the heat transfer through the waste 
canister, buffer, and host rock is dominant by conduction and the heat transfer by 
radiation and convection are negligible.  Under these assumptions, the governing 
equations of the time-dependent conduction heat transfer for the temperatures in the 
buffer (e.g., bentonite or crushed magnesium oxide) and host rock (e.g., crystalline 
rock or sedimentary rock) can respectively be written as

3. Results and discussions 
Eqs. (20) and (21) are rather complicate; therefore, they are inverted numerically 
by the routine INLAP of IMSL (2003) which was developed based on a numerical 
algorithm originally proposed by Crump (1976) and modified by de Hoog et al. 
(1982).  The algorithm approximates the Laplace inversion by expressing the 
inverted function in a Fourier series and accelerates the evaluation by the Shanks 
method (Shanks, 1955, Peng, et al., 2002).  This method has been successfully

values of parameters are: the radius of the waste canister rW = 0.19 m, the height of 
the waste canister LW = 1.50 m, the radial distance from the waste canister centerline 
to the outer buffer envelope rB = 0.376 m, and the constant heat flux of the waste 
canister Q0 is 600 W.  The ratio of cylinder surface area to total surface area for the 
waste canister is 0.94.  Thus, the constant heat flux of the waste canister is modified 
as 0.94 Q0.  The initial temperatures of the buffer and rock are set as an average of 
32 0C.  The temperature-time curves at the vertical centerline and the buffer mid (rWB 
= rW + (rB - rW)/2) for rE = 15 m and L = 25 m, rE = 30 m and L = 50 m, and rE = 60 m 
and L = 100 m are shown in Fig. 2.  The figure shows that the temperature increases 
slowly with time, reaches the maximum at one year, then decreases with time and 
gradually approaches a steady value at about 2000 years for the rE = 60 m and L = 100 
m boundary and at about 200 years for the rE = 30 m and L = 50 m boundary.  The 
temperature at the boundary for rE = 15 m and L = 25 m also increases slowly with 
time, reaches the maximum at one year, then decreases with time.  However, this 
temperature curve increases again with time after about 40 years and approaches a 
steady value at about 2000 years.  This result indicates that the heat transfer of a 
single disposal borehole may be modeled as the heat transfer in a finite boundary.  
So the temperature in a spent-nuclear-fuel repository site is higher than that in a case 
with an infinite-extent boundary.   
  15
the temperature distribution curves for rE = 10 m are plotted in Fig. 4 to investigate 
the effects on the outside of the waste canister rW, the buffer mid rWB, the 
borehole-rock boundary rB, and the center between adjacent boreholes rE temperatures.  
The maximum temperatures are 87.86 0C at 16 years for rW, 78.16 0C at 26 years for 
rWB, 71.70 0C at 42 years for rB, and 64.44 0C at about 530 years for rE.  The results 
satisfy the requirement of the low-temperature disposal site standard that the 
temperatures are less 100 0C at rW, 80 0C at rB, and 70 0C at rE, respectively.  
Those results demonstrate that the present analytical model can be used to assess 
the effects of the varying waste canister spacing on the waste canister outside, the 
buffer mid, the borehole-rock boundary, and the center between adjacent boreholes 
temperatures in a geological repository for a spent nuclear fuel.  The present 
analytical solutions have practical use in designing the spent-nuclear-fuel geological 
repository. 
 
4. Concluding remarks 
1. A mathematical model describing the heat transfer in transient temperature field 
in a final spent-nuclear-fuel repository is presented.  The Laplace-domain 
solutions for the temperature distribution are developed using the Laplace 
transforms and the corresponding solutions in time domain are calculated using
