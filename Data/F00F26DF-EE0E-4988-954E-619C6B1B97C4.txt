experimental group under Chan-meditation natural 
respiration. Quantification of RSA (respiratory sinus 
arrhythmia) and HRV (heart rate variability) was 
employed in the evaluation of regulation of 
sympathetic-parasympathetic activity and efficiency of 
pulmonary gas exchange. SDNN (standard deviation of 
normal-to-normal heart-beating intervals) provides a 
time-domain approach for evaluating the HRV activity, 
yet, requires a long-term record of the NN intervals 
for reliable estimate. An alternative approach based 
on power spectrum of the NN intervals is feasible for 
short-time analysis. In the frequency-domain scheme, 
HRV behavior is quantified by the ratio of low-
frequency power to high-frequency power (denoted by 
LF/HF) of HRV spectrum. 
In traditional HRV analysis (tHRV), the ratio LF/HF is 
very likely to be overestimated in the case of low 
respiratory rate (particularly, slower than 8 
breaths/min). Such overestimate is resulted from the 
overlap of respiratory spectrum with low-frequency 
band reflecting the sympathetic activity. Accordingly, 
tHRV cannot accurately distinguish sympathetic-driven 
from parasympathetic-driven frequency band. In this 
study, two methods are developed to deal with the 
issue: adaptive frequency range (AFR) method and 
least-mean-square adaptive filtering methods (AFLMS). 
For comparison, RSA and SDNN were also evaluated. To 
analyze all the above three indexes, ECG 
(electrocardiograph) and respiratory signals were 
recorded from two groups, experimental and control 
group including respectively ten Chan-meditation 
practitioners and fourteen normal, healthy subjects in 
the same age range, yet, without any meditation 
experience. Preliminary results show that, in the high 
RR (respiration-rate) range (18~26 breaths/min), SDNN 
of control group is larger than that of experimental 
group； while in the slow RR range (6~14 breaths/min) 
SDNN’s of both groups are approximately the same. 
Moreover, LFLMS/HFLMS ratio characterizing the HRV 
reveals a better sympathetic-parasympathetic balance 
(ratio~1) in the experimental than in the control 
group for the slow RR range.

It was reported that more people had been suffering the stress-related syndromes since 
1980’s. Chan meditation thus became one of the most important and widely adopted 
approaches for stress management and health enhancement some twenty-five years ago, The 
efficacy of Chan meditation in stress relief has been proved by most practitioners. This 
research is aimed to explore the inside mechanisms via the cardiorespiratory-interaction 
phenomenon. 
The interaction between human cardiac and respiratory systems has been widely studied 
for many decades. It has been found that these two systems do not act independently; instead, 
they are coupled by some mechanisms. One well-known phenomenon of cardiorespiratory 
interaction is the frequency modulation of heart rate by respiration, which is known as 
respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). RSA portrays the heart rate variability in synchrony with 
respiration, that is, the heart rate increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration. 
With RSA, human pulmonary air exchange can be more efficient. In addition to modulation, 
other cardiorespiratory interaction such as synchronization has been observed, and the nature 
of interaction like nonlinear coupling was proposed in recent years. 
This report presents the results of our study on cardiorespiratory interactions for the 
control group under pre-designed breathing control paradigm and the experimental group 
under Chan-meditation natural respiration. Quantification of RSA (respiratory sinus 
arrhythmia) and HRV (heart rate variability) was employed in the evaluation of regulation of 
sympathetic-parasympathetic activity and efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange. SDNN 
(standard deviation of normal-to-normal heart-beating intervals) provides a time-domain 
approach for evaluating the HRV activity, yet, requires a long-term record of the NN intervals 
for reliable estimate. An alternative approach based on power spectrum of the NN intervals is 
feasible for short-time analysis. In the frequency-domain scheme, HRV behavior is quantified 
by the ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power (denoted by LF/HF) of HRV 
spectrum. 
In traditional HRV analysis (tHRV), the ratio LF/HF is very likely to be overestimated in 
the case of low respiratory rate (particularly, slower than 8 breaths/min). Such overestimate is

(electroencephalograph) has revealed some exclusive characteristics of a Chan-enlightened 
brain.  
The interaction between human cardiac and respiratory systems has been widely studied 
for many decades. It has been found that these two systems do not act independently; instead, 
they are coupled by some mechanisms. In addition to RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) [1], 
other cardiorespiratory interaction such as synchronization has been observed, and the nature 
of interaction like nonlinear coupling was proposed in recent years [2-5]. This is the major 
focus of our first-year’s research cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CPRS) 
quantified by synchrogram [6-7].  
Heart rate variability (HRV), evaluated by the power spectrum of HR sequence, is 
manipulated by the interactions of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in 
autonomic nervous system (ANS). The low-frequency (LF) range of 0.04-0.15Hz of the HR 
spectrum is usually considered as the marker of sympathetic activity, while the 
high-frequency (HF) range of 0.15-0.4Hz is referred to as the marker of parasympathetic 
activity[8-10]. Vagal activity is the major contributor to the HF component. 
Recent studies suggest that HF component of HRV is driven by the parasympathetic 
activity and is affected by respiration. Hence it is reasonable to assume that the respiratory 
activity may contribute to the HF component[8, 11]. Traditional method for HRV analysis 
(tHRV) based on conventional spectral analysis of HR sequence has been widely used to 
examine the underlying mechanisms of ANS due to its simplicity. Nevertheless, it fails to 
isolate the effect of both branches of ANS (that is, sympathetic and parasympathetic systems) 
imposed on HRV. For example, causes a shift towards the low-frequency range defined for 
the sympathetic activity at low respiratory rates. In such cases, tHRV analysis often results in 
an overestimate at low respiratory rates. 
Respiration inducing significant effect on parasympathetic activity is closely related to 
respiratory sinus rhythm (RSA). Accordingly, measure of RSA is normally used as an index 
of vagal tone[8, 12]. Researchers consider RSA and HF range of the HR spectrum 
(abbreviated as HRV-HF) as an index of cardiac parasympathetic control[13]. In the report, 
the methods of adaptive frequency range (AFR) and least-mean-square adaptive filtering 
(AFLMS) are developed to resolve the issue of HRV-HF overlapping HRV-LF at the slow 
respiration rate during Chan meditation. The report demonstrates that new method may 
provide a way to differentiate the effect of both branches of ANS (that is, sympathetic and 
parasympathetic systems) so that more reliable and meaningful evaluation of HRV can be 
achieved. 
Breathing regulation to calm down the mind and mood is one of the most important 
fundamentals of Chan meditation for the beginners. In addition, correct breathing trained by 
meditation helps one to better manage the body and mind stress and therefore to enhance the

2.2 Evaluation of RSA 
In this study, we quantify the RSA behavior by using the formula proposed in [9]. Firstly, 
an appropriate window size Nc is determined in the scale of number of breaths. For example, 
Nc =5 indicates a window size of 5 breaths. The RRI (R-to-R interval) sequence is 
reconstructed from the ECG signal. In the ith RRI epoch of Nc-breath duration, we first 
compute the average of positive-peak values +iP  and the average of negative-peak values 
−
iP  within the RRI epoch. Then, the RSA rate RRSA is estimated by the normalized difference 
in the following formula:

The term of scale in wavelet sometimes can be treated as frequency, the pseudo-frequency 
is a term which describes the relationship between scale and frequency, and it presents broad 
sense for frequencies that exist in a signal. To obtain pseudo-frequency we have to calculate 
the central frequency Fc of the wavelet and use the following relationship: 
∆⋅= a
FF ca                             (2.5) 
where 
• a is a scale, 
• ∆ is the sampling period, 
   • Fc is the center frequency of a wavelet (Hz), 
• Fa is the pseudo - frequency corresponding to the scale a (Hz). 
 The contribution to the signal energy E(a,b) at the specific a scale and b location is given 
by the two-dimensional wavelet energy density function known as the scalogram (analogous 
to the spectrogram—the energy density surface of the STFT), defined as below: 
2),(),( baCbaE =                       (2.6) 
 
2.4 LMS (Least-mean-square) adaptive filter 
The main aim of this study is to remove the effect of respiration from HR sequence. 
Adaptive filtering provides a feasible approach for reducing the interference of artifact 
(respiration) based on the a priori knowledge of the artifact itself. In the scheme, we are able 
to derive HRREAL with respiration interference being removed from the original HRRESP [8]. 
Accordingly, we may compare the effect of respiration activity on the HRV analysis. 
    The least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter was selected because of its stability, 
efficiency and simple structure. Figure 2.3 displays the structure of the filter. The LMS 
algorithm computes a set of optimum coefficients, which are adjusted to minimize the mean 
square error (MSE) between desired signal d[n] and filter output signal y[n]:

This algorithm is based on the steepest descent algorithm where the weights are updated 
on a sample-by-sample basis. In a transversal filter of length N, the output sample y[n] at time 
n is computed by a weighted sum of the current and delayed input samples xሬԦሾnሿ:

Step 1: 
In the HR pre-processing step, R-peak detection algorithm was first applied to ECG 
signal to extract all R peaks in the ECG and then construct the RRI (R-to-R interval) time 
series. RRI sequence represents a series of sample data (events) digitized at the occurrence of 
R peaks. Since empirical signals are mostly pseudo-periodic (that is, a typical prototype 
repeats at a varying pace), the RRI sequence accordingly corresponds to a digital signal 
sampled with non-uniform sampling rate. To uniform the sampling rate, we firstly 
interpolated the RRI sequence by Cubic Spline and then re-sampled the interpolated signal

demonstrated to be appropriate for characterizing the parasympathetic activity. Then, such HF 
area defined above will be named as HFa. On the other hand, LF range will be reduced to 
0.04-0.1 Hz because the range 0.1-0.15 Hz is easily interfered by the respiratory activity 
under slow breathing of rate 6-9 breaths/min. To make the terms of AFR distinct from those 
of tHRV, the new range 0.04-0.1 Hz employed in AFR method will be named as LFa [2] , as 
shown in Figure 3.3 (a). 
 
 
When respiratory rate is below 9 breaths/min, RFf is below 0.15 Hz and HFa shifts to the 
lower frequencies as indicated in Figure 3.4 (a)

Step 1: 
In the HR pre-processing step, R-peak detection algorithm (Appendix A) was  first 
applied to ECG signal to extract all R peaks in the ECG and then construct the RRI (R-to-R 
interval) time series. RRI sequence represents a series of sample data (events) digitized at the 
occurrence of R peaks. Since empirical signals are mostly pseudo-periodic (that is, a typical 
prototype repeats at a varying pace), the RRI sequence accordingly corresponds to a digital 
signal sampled with non-uniform sampling rate. To uniform the sampling rate, we firstly 
interpolated the RRI sequences by Cubic Spline and then re-sampled the interpolated signal 
with an equivalent sampling rate of 4Hz. Finally, the reciprocal of sampled data was 
computed as the heart-rate value HR[n]. 
In the RP (respiratory) pre-processing step, the original respiratory signal was firstly 
down-sampled into a time series with the sample rate of 4Hz. To obtain the respiratory time 
series RP[n], a bandpass filter with passband 0.04-0.4Hz was applied to reduce the baseline 
drift and high-frequency noise.

As shown in Figure 3.7, HR[n] in 3.7(a) is the original HR sequence. HRREAL [n] in Figure 
3.7(c) is the residual component after removing the respiratory component RP[n] (Figure 
3.7(b)) from HR[n] by equation (2.7). 
 
Step 3: 
To perform CWT computation, the MATLAB build-in function with a pseudo-frequency 
of 0.01-0.6 was employed. Morlet function was used as the mother wavelet prototype. The 
resulted time-frequency (TF) mapd of HRREAL and HRRESP are displayed in image profile 
(Figure 3.8). 
 
Step 4: 
 Estimate LFLMS/HFLMS for AFLMS scheme: calculate LFLMS from the frequency spectrum 
of time-frequency plot of HRREAL at time n, where LFLMS is the total power in frequency band 
0.04-0.15 Hz. And HFLMS is derived from the frequency spectrum of time-frequency plot of 
HRRESP at time n, where HFLMS is the total power in frequency band 0.01-0.6Hz. In addition, 
HRRESP is the component of HR biased by the respiration, as shown in Figure 3.14.

practicing Chan meditation freely without any control-factor intervention, the 
cardiorespiratory interacting behavior was hypothesized to occur naturally. Accordingly, the 
significant increase of HR upon spontaneously increasing respiration might reflect some 
extraordinary cardiorespiratory interaction due to energy regulation for Heart-Chakra 
purification in Chan meditation.

Figure 4.2 displays intra-group average of SDNN in each RR session for both the 
experimental group (light-gray bars) and the control group (dark-gray bars). In the low 
respiration-rate ranges (S1~S3), SDNN’s of both groups are approximately the same; whereas 
respiration rate higher than 18 breaths/min results in distinguishable behavior in two groups. 
The phenomenon can be manifested by comparing the percentage of increase of SDNN with 
the decrease of respiration rate:  
exp. group: (S5→S4) 1.1%, (S4→S3) 37.1%, (S3→S2) 10.5%, (S2→S1) 17.0%; 
cnt. group: (S5→S4) 8.0%, (S4→S3) 14.3%, (S3→S2) 16.6%, (S2→S1) 14.5%. 
Experimental group (meditation practitioners) reveals a more stable 
cardiorespiratory-interaction characteristic even at higher respiration rate. Efficiency of 
SDNN manipulation by respiration regulation is remarkably robust in experimental group, 
particularly, SDNN increases 37% when respiration rate drops to an average of 16 
breaths/min. On the other hand, SDNN behavior in control group appears to be less sensitive 
to respiration regulation.

5. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 
 
In this report, we studied how to accurate analyze frequency-domain analysis of HRV. 
Because the HF component of HRV is driven by parasympathetic activity and is affected by 
respiratio[8]. tHRV was found out that cannot very accurate analyze frequency-domain of 
HRV when respiration was slower than 9 breaths/min, so we used AFR and AFLMS method to 
accurate localization of parasympathetic activity in frequency-domain analysis. Differences 
between average LF/HF and average LFa/HFa are mostly within 0.3 from S1 to S4 
(24≤RR≤12 breaths/min). However, the difference in the S5 session (RR=8 breaths/min) 
increases up to 1.8. This evidence depicts the improvement of AFR and AFLMS algorithms in 
HRV estimate, particularly, when the respiration is very slow (8 breaths/min). Average 
LF/HF ratio decreases as the respiratory rate decreases from S1 to S4. An exceptionally ratio 
value occurs in the 5th session of slowest respiratory rate (8 breaths/min).We also analyzed 
other physiological signals include RSA, SDNN, HR and HR/RR when the respiration is low. 
The main aim of this research was to investigate the effects of slow breathing on the analysis 
of HRV for both the experimental group and control group. 
 Result of most control subject all demonstrates the decrease of LFLMS/HFLMS ratio and 
LFa/HFa ratio form 24 breaths/min to 8 breaths/min. By employing SPSS to the LFLMS/HFLMS
