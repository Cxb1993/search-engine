Sugeno model [22] have started to draw much attention from researchers. Due to the
effectiveness, the method of Takagi-Sugeno models is frequently used to represent complex
nonlinear systems with fuzzy sets and fuzzy reasoning. The basic idea is to integrate
simple local linear dynamic systems with their linguistic description that they represent
highly nonlinear dynamic systems. It is perceived that human experts can apply linguistic
descriptions of local systems in terms of IF-THEN rules. This, in effect, strengthens the
feasibility of the Takagi-Sugeno method.
In this reports, we propose the notion of simultaneously nilpotent interval matrices, and
some sufficient conditions for the T-S free fuzzy system with time-varying uncertainties
to be strongly stable within n steps are established, where n relates to the dimension
of interval matrices. A unique situation for the deterministic Takagi-Sugeno free fuzzy
system to be strongly stable within n steps is therefore derived, where n relates to the
dimension of characteristic matrices for the Takagi-Sugeno free fuzzy system. Finally,
some conclusions will be given.

Let Σ be a set of n× n complex matrices. For m ≥ 1, Σm is the set of all products of
matrices in Σ of the length m, that is,
Σm = {A1A2 · · ·Am : Ai ∈ Σ, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m}.
The set S(Σ) = ∪m≥1Σm denotes the multiplicative semigroup generated by Σ. The ρ(A)
and ||A|| denote the spectral radius and an operator norm of matrix A, respectively (see
Varga [25]). The joint spectral radius of Σ (see Rota and Strang [16]), ρˆ(Σ), is defined by
ρˆ(Σ) = lim sup
m→∞
[ sup
A∈Σm
‖A‖ ] 1m .
The generalized spectral radius of Σ (see Daubechies and Lagarias [3]), ρ(Σ), is defined by
ρ(Σ) = lim sup
m→∞

It has been proved that ρ(Σ) = ρˆ(Σ) whenever Σ is a bounded set (see [2],[4],[17]).
Lagarias and Wang [9] proved that if ρ(Σ) = 0, then even when Σ is infinite, ρ(Σ) =
ρˆ(Σ) = 0.
Let Ψ be a set of n × n interval matrices. To ease our notation, we omit the · and
parentheses in products of interval matrices. Instead of using (A · B) · C, ((A · B) · C) · D,
(((A · B) · C) · D) · E , etc., we use AB C, AB C D, AB C D E , etc., for all A,B, C,D, E , etc.

Ψm = {A1A2 · · · Am : Ai ∈ Ψ, i = 1, 2, · · · ,m}.
We denote S(Ψ) =

Theorem 1: Let Ψ be a set in Mn(IR) with I(Ψ∗)# = k. Then the following statements
are mutually equivalent.
(i) Ψ is simultaneously nilpotent.
(ii) ρ(Ψ˜) = 0.
(iii) There is an (n − k) × (n − k) nonsingular matrix Q1 and a k × k permutation
matrix P1 such that Q

The following mathematical model of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system with time-varying
uncertainty was employed by Pang and Guu [14]. They assumed that the consequent
parameters are subjected to time-varying uncertainties. In other words, the matrices Ai
and Bi employed in each rule are varied due to the uncertainty for each time k. Precisely,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , N , and A(i) is an n × n interval matrix and B(i) is an n × m interval
matrix, the RULEi becomes
IF (x1(k) is S
i
1 AND · · · AND xn(k) is Sin)
THEN x¯(k + 1) = Ai(k)x¯(k) +Bi(k)u¯(k),
where Ai(k) ∈ A(i) and Bi(k) ∈ B(i). Then the state vector at time instant k + 1 is
updated by

一、參加會議經過 
On July 18, I flew to the United States joining the tenth JCIS, Joint Conference on 
Information Sciences, which was held in the Marriott City Center, Salt Lake City, 
Utah. This conference was sponsored by JCIS, LLC, registered in the State of North 
Carolina (U.S.A.), Duke University (U.S.A.), Harbin Institute of Technology (China), 
and attracted more than two thousand scholars worldwide. Different topics and 
findings were covered ranging from Negative Index Materials, Artificial Intelligence, 
Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, Chance Discovery in Data 
mining, Fuzzy Logic, Uncertainty Mathematics, to Ambient Intelligence. 
 
The session I was in was FTT, 2007. The topic delivered was about using fuzzy 
genetic algorithms to estimate null values in relational database systems. As we know, 
in enterprises, relational database systems found wider uses in information 
management. To retrieve the information about one employee, for example, we can 
just select the tuple with the appropriate identification attribute value from a relation. 
In the process of one query, sometimes a relation may be partitioned into two or more 
related relations. It might happen though that one of the relations fails when a query is 
submitted. Bearing the convenience of speed and management as the ultimate goal for 
all enterprises, we provided a method to estimate the data stored in the failed server. 
In light of Chen and Huang’s work in 2003 IEEE Trans. On Fuzzy Systems, we 
proposed a fuzzy genetic algorithm, a generalization of GA, to estimate null values of 
attributes in relational database systems. This fuzzy-related method, fuzzy genetic 
algorithms, attempted to add more theoretical views on genetic algorithms in the 
hopes that the randomly generated chromosomes in genetic algorithms can be of some 
control.  
 
My talk was arranged at 1:30-3:20pm session on July 20. While I was waiting to be 
on the stage, I was nervous and tried hard to calm myself down. Yet, when it was my
