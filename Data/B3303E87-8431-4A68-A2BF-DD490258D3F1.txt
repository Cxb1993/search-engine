Abstract: The objective of the proposal is to develop a systematic solution approach in the state 
space setting for piezothermoelasticity, in which the interactions of electric, thermal and 
mechanical fields in composite laminates and functionally graded materials (FGM) are studied. 
The associated eigensystem in the framework possessing symplectic orthogonality for 
eigenfunction expansion will be used in the analysis of composite laminates, and further, in the 
application of three-dimensional analysis of piezothermoelasticity. We attempt to construct the 
formalism in a universal framework so that it would facilitate analysis of mechanics problems of 
anisotropic elasticity, thermoelasticity and piezothermoelasticity. The following topics will be 
studied in a period of two years: 
1. Analysis of composite laminates and FGM in the state space formulation. 
2. State space approach to three-dimensional analysis of piezothermoelasticity. 
It is expected that the study will contribute significantly in theory and produce useful results in 
practice. 
Keywords: anisotropic elasticity, piezothermoelasticity, functionally graded materials, composite 
structures, laminated systems, Hamiltonian, state space.

過去相關研究所採用之狀態空間數學模式，係基於對場量變數作適當分類與方程式重組
建立起來的，這使得依此推得的狀態方程式之數學特性無法完全展現。最新研究結果顯
示，將三維彈性力學基本方程式以位移向量和應力向量表示，可推得數學形式更為簡潔
清楚之狀態方程式與輸出方程式。此改良式狀態空間數學模式下，有關 Hamiltonian 
symplecticity 之數學特性得以在三維架構下獲得驗證。許多傳統數學解析方法，如矩陣
代數法、分離變數法，以及特徵函數展開法亦得以充分運用。將此數學架構由彈性力學
問題推廣至壓電彈性力學問題，並以廣義位移向量和廣義應力向量作為基本變量，結果
僅是方程式中材料係數矩陣因場量變數增加而由 3×3 矩陣擴大為 4×4 矩陣外，整個方程
式之形式架構與彈性力學問題之數學模式相同，依然保有 Hamiltonian symplecticity 等數

Abstract A 3D exact analysis of extension, torsion and bending of a cantilever of a cir-
cular cross section is studied with emphasis on the fixed-end effect. Through Hamiltonian
variational formulation, the basic equations of elasticity in cylindrical coordinates and the
boundary conditions of the problem are formulated into the state space setting in which the
state vector comprises the displacement vector and the conjugate stress vector as the dual
variables. Upon delineating the Hamiltonian characteristics of the system, 3D solutions for
transversely isotropic circular cantilevers subjected to an axial force, a torque, terminal cou-
ples and transverse forces are determined, thereby, the fixed-end effects and applicability of
the solutions of generalized plane strains and the elementary theory of bending of beams are
evaluated.

1 Introduction
This work is concerned with 3D exact analysis of circular cantilevers under extension, tor-
sion and bending. Stress and displacement fields in cantilevers are often evaluated on the
basis of the elementary beam theory [1] in which the end conditions are relaxed for sim-
plification. Specifically, the end conditions are not satisfied in a pointwise fashion. Instead
the traction conditions at the loaded end are only ensured to satisfy resultant force and mo-
ment conditions, while the zero displacement conditions at the fixed end are only satisfied

on the deformation and stress fields and to assess how close the simpler solutions based on
the elementary beam theories and on the plane strain assumption are to the exact elasticity
solutions.
2 Problem Statement
Consider a circular cantilever of transversely isotropic or isotropic elastic materials sub-
jected to terminal loads. Referred to cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z), with z-axis being the
axis of symmetry, the constitutive equations of the material are
⎡

where, it is understood that the indices 1,2,3 stand for r , θ , and z, respectively, σij and
εij are the stress and strain components; cij are the elastic constants with reference to
cylindrical coordinates. With c66 = (c11 − c12)/2, there are five independent elastic con-
stants for transversely isotropic materials. For isotropic materials, c33 = c11, c13 = c12,
c44 = c66 = (c11 − c12)/2, in addition.

To focus on the effect of the fixed end, we consider that the cantilever is traction-free
on the cylindrical surface r = a and subjected to terminal loads at the end z = l, which
in general include an axial force P3, a torque Mt , transverse forces (P1, P2), and biaxial
couples (M1, M2). With the fixed end at z = 0, the BC of the problem are

A Hamiltonian State Space Approach for 3D Analysis of Circular 211
In formulating the basic equations into the state space setting in which the system matrix
is a Hamiltonian matrix, it is essential that the state vector be composed of the dual variables.
Duality of the state variables arises as a natural result of the Hamiltonian formulation.
Let the displacement vector u play the role of the dynamic variable and the coordinate
z play the role of the time variable in a dynamic system, i.e., q  u, q  u,z, according to
the notation in classical mechanics [15, 16]. The Hamiltonian of a conservative system is
derived from the Lagrangian by introducing a conjugate variable p, dual with u, through
Legendre’s transformation
H(u,p,u,r ,u,θ ) = pT u,z − L(u,u,z,u,r ,u,θ ), (11)
such that
p = ∂L
∂u,z
. (12)
The Lagrangian of the system in terms of the displacement vector is given by L =
rU(u,u,z,u,r ,u,θ ). Replacing L in  by H via (11), performing δ = 0 and integrating
by parts, we obtain
∫

[(

∂u,r
− ∂

∂H
∂u,θ
)T
δu
]
drdθdz = 0. (13)
There follows the canonical equations:
∂u
∂z
= ∂H
∂p
,
∂p
∂z
= −∂H
∂u
+ ∂
∂r
∂H
∂u,r
+ ∂
∂θ
∂H
∂u,θ
. (14)
The state equation is obtained by expressing (14) in terms of the state vector. To this end,
a substitution of L = rU(u,u,z,u,r ,u,θ ) into (12) gives
p =
⎡
⎣
pr

pz
⎤

]
⎤
⎦ =
⎡
⎣
rσrz

⎤
⎦ , (15)
which reveals that, when z is taken to be the distinguished coordinate, the conjugate vector
dual with u = [ur, uθ , uz]T is p = rσ z = [rσrz, rσθz, rσzz]T , rather than the traction vector
σ z = [σrz, σθz, σzz]T on the plane normal to z-axis.
Expressing u,z in terms of u and p via (15), then substituting it into (11) to express H in
terms of u and p and using it in (14), we obtain

It will be clear later on that extension and torsion by an axial force and a torque is deter-
mined from (20)–(21) with n = 0; biaxial bending by terminal couples and transverse forces
is determined from (20)–(21) with n = 1 and n = 2.
5 Hamiltonian Characteristics
Let us seek the solution to (20) in the form
Xn(r, z) = ψn(r)eμz, (n = 0,1,2), (22)
where μ is the eigenvalue of the system, and ψn(r) is an unknown vector function of r ,
ψn(r) =
[
Un(r) Vn(r) Wn(r) Xn(r) Yn(r) Zn(r)
]T
.
Equation (20) together with the homogeneous BC on r = a becomes
Hnψn = μψn, Br (ψn) = 0 on r = a. (23)
A Hamiltonian State Space Approach for 3D Analysis of Circular 215
When μi + μj = 0 (j = −i), there follows
∫ a
0
ψTniJψnj dr = 0, (j = −i) (31)
which is the symplectic orthogonality for the eigenvectors associated with μi = 0.
When μi +μj = 0 (j = −i), the relation between ψni and ψ−ni is derived by considering
the non-homogeneous system
(Hn − μiI)ϕ = ψni , Br (ϕ) = 0, (32)
which is unsolvable because (25) has a non-trivial solution.
Pre-multiplying (32) by ψT−niJ and integrating it with respect to r over (0, a) yields
∫ a
0
ψT−niJHnϕdr = μi
∫ a
0
ψT−niJϕdr +
∫ a
0
ψT−niJψnidr. (33)
which, after integrating by parts the left-hand side and using (JHn)∗ = JHn, becomes
∫ a
0
ϕT J (Hn + μiI)ψ−nidr + B(ψ−ni ,ϕ) =
∫ a
0
ψT−niJψnidr, (34)
where B(ψ−ni ,ϕ) denotes the boundary integral term.
The left-hand side of (34) vanishes because of (24), so it reduces to
∫ a
0
ψT−niJψnidr = 0, (35)
which is the solvability condition of (32).
On the other hand, knowing that (32) is unsolvable, it follows that (35) is not satisfied,
∫ a
0
ψT−niJψnidr = −
∫ a
0
ψTniJψ−nidr = 0. (36)
In summary, the symplectic orthogonality relations of the eigenvectors associated with
the non-zero eigenvalues are
∫ a
0
ψTniJψnj dr
{= 0 for j = −i
= 0 for j = −i. (37)
The case of zero eigenvalue (μ0 = 0) which is a repeated eigenvalue of even multiplicity
requires special consideration. When the multiplicity of μ0 = 0 is m (m = 2,4, . . .), the
associated linearly independent eigenvectors [17] are given by
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
X(0)n = ψ (0)n ,
X(1)n = ψ (1)n + zψ (0)n ,
...
X(m−1)n = ψ (m−1)n + zψ (m−2)n + · · · + zm−1(m−1)!ψ (0)n .
(38)
Substituting (38) in (20) results in the Jordan chain:
{
Hnψ (0)n = 0, Br (ψ (0)n ) = 0,
Hnψ (α)n = ψ (α−1)n , Br (ψ (α)n ) = 0 for α = 1,2, . . . ,m − 1. (39)
A Hamiltonian State Space Approach for 3D Analysis of Circular 217
With the symplectic orthogonality given by (37) and (49), it is possible to express an
arbitrary, integrable vector function in terms of a sequence of orthogonal eigenvectors by
eigenfunction expansion in the symplectic state space. Application of the symplectic or-
thogonality requires the explicit solution of (23), which is derived subsequently.
6 Extension and Torsion
6.1 Explicit Solution
When the cantilever is subjected to an axial force P3 and a torque Mt at z = l, the defor-
mation and the stress field are independent of θ . Equation (23) for n = 0 can be solved by
letting

where J0(λr) and J1(λr) are Bessel functions of the first kind of the zeroth order and the
first order; λ is a parameter and c1, c2, . . . , c6 are constants to be determined.
Substituting (50) in (23) and using the derivative formulas of Bessel functions [18, 19],
we arrive at

which can be solved independently. Non-trivial solutions exist if the determinant of the
coefficient matrix equals to zero. This yields

from which the eigenvalues μi (i = 1,2, . . .) for extension and μ′i (i = 1,2, . . .) for torsion
are determined, subsequently, the associated eigenvectors.
By inspection, (65) and (66) are satisfied as well if μ is replaced by −μ and μ′ by −μ′.
Thus, if μ (μ′) is an eigenvalue, so is −μ (−μ′). Further, since μ is a common factor of
f3(κ1,μ, r) and f3(κ2,μ, r) in (65) and μ0 = 0 is a zero of J1(κjμa) and J2(κjμa), it
follows that μ0 = 0 is a repeated eigenvalue. Clearly, μ′0 = 0 is also a repeated eigenvalue.
This is consistent with the Hamiltonian characteristics delineated in Sect. 5.
The case of the repeated eigenvalue μ0 = 0 calls for attention. The linearly independent
eigenvectors are given by ψ (0)0 and ψ

where λ is a parameter and c1, c′1, . . . , c6 are constants to be determined.
Substituting (77) into (23) for n = 1, we obtain c2 = c1, c′2 = −c′1, c5 = c4, c′5 = −c′4,

which are the same as (51) and (52). It follows that non-trivial solutions of (78) and (79)
exist only if

where κ1, κ2, and κ3 are given by (55)–(57).
To each λi there corresponds a non-trivial solution. Since J0(−λir) = J0(λir),
J1(−λir) = −J1(λir), J2(−λir) = J2(λir), three (rather than six) linearly independent so-
lutions are derived from (78)–(79). As a result, the complete solution for vertical bending of

Examining the expressions of f4(κi,μ, r), f7(κi,μ, r), and f8(κi,μ, r), we find that (84)
is satisfied as well if μ is replaced by −μ. Thus, if μ is an eigenvalue, so is −μ. Further,
μ0 = 0 is a repeated eigenvalue of multiplicity 4 since μ0 = 0 is a root of J1(κiμr) = 0 and
a double root of J2(κiμr) = 0. The four linearly independent eigenvectors associated with

The solution in case of isotropy is determined in a similar manner. At this point, it re-
mains to determine the unknown constants A0, B0, C0, D0, and Ai , A−i in (94) and (95) by
satisfying the BC at the end sections.
8 Satisfaction of the End Conditions
With the symplectic orthogonality, we are in a position to determine the unknown constants
in (73)–(76) for extension and torsion and those in (94)–(95) for vertical bending. As the
constant determination for both cases follows the same line, let us determine the unknown
constants in (94)–(95) for illustration.
Consider vertical bending of the cantilever under transverse force P2 and couple M1.
Upon imposing the end conditions (5)–(7) on (94), with Ur(r,0) = Uθ(r,0) = Uz(r,0) =
0 at the fixed-end section (z = 0) and Srz(r, l), Sθz(r, l), Szz(r, l) being prescribed at the
terminal section (z = l) such that the resultant force and the resultant moment equal to P2
and M1, and P1 = P3 = M2 = Mt = 0, we arrive at

Equations (110)–(113) constitute a system of integral equations, solvable by the method
of collocation for solving the integral equations [20, 21]. Note that the terms on the
right-hand sides of the equations are completely known; the unknowns Srz(r,0), Sθz(r,0),
Szz(r,0) in F0(r) and Ur(r, l), Uθ(r, l), Uz(r, l) in Fl (r) are related to the constants A0,
B0, Ai and A−i by (94). Thus, substituting the relevant component equations of (94) in
(110)–(113), taking m terms of the series for computation, we arrive at a system of 2m + 2
algebraic equations (2 equations from (110) and (111); 2m equations from (112) and (113)
for i = 1,2, . . . ,m) for the 2m + 2 unknowns (A0, B0, Ai and A−i , i = 1,2, . . . ,m), which
can be easily solved by using a standard method for simultaneous linear algebraic equations.
9 Results and Discussions
To examine quantitatively the fixed-end effects, the following non-dimensional values of
the elastic constants are taken for computation: c33/c11 = 1 (isotropic material); 5, 10, 20
and c12/c11 = c13/c11 = c44/c11 = 1/3 for transversely isotropic materials. These values are
typical for engineering materials, ranging from aluminum to epoxy-based fiber-reinforced
composites such as glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy. The dimensions of the circular can-
tilever are taken to be l/a = 10.
Table 1 shows the first 25 non-dimensional eigenvalues μia of the vertical bending
mode, in which the first eigenvalues are zero and repeated with multiplicity 4, resulting in
z3-dependent displacements and linearly z-dependent stresses. As discussed in [12, 13], a
simple measure to estimate the extent of the stress disturbance due to the end effect is the
characteristic decay length:
L = ln 100
Re(μ)
, (114)
where Re(μ) denotes the real part of the lowest non-zero eigenvalue. It is the distance from
the ends of a long circular cylinder beyond which the deformation and stresses are virtually
unaffected by the end conditions. For a sufficiently long isotropic elastic circular cylinder
(c33 = c11), L = 1.649a. This suggests that the stress disturbance due to the end effect is con-
fined to a region within a distance of less than a diameter (L ≤ 2a) from the end. For a suf-
ficiently long transversely isotropic circular cylinder with c33/c11 = 5, 10, 20, L = 2.703a,
3.973a, 5.874a, respectively, suggesting that the end effect increases as c33 increases.
In evaluating the displacements and stresses in the cantilever, convergent results are ob-
tained by taking no more than 30 terms of the series at locations other than the fixed end.
Due to geometric discontinuity and the stringent zero-displacement BC at the fixed end, it

between the 3D stress distribution and its 2D counterpart exist in the vicinity of the fixed
end; it is necessary to conduct a 3D analysis to evaluate the stress field in the region of
disturbance.
In closing, the Hamiltonian state space approach put problems of elasticity in a broad
prospect. Many aspects of the development such as Hamiltonian characteristics and sym-

Elastic Properties of Self-Supported Circular Thin Copper Films Calculated from Equilibrium Thermal Vibration Chang and Hwang
electrical switch applications and hence selfsupported cop-
per ﬁlms. For thin ﬁlms of this type, relaxation of the
free surfaces would produce signiﬁcant residual stress,
leading to changes from bulk lattice parameters and bulk
mechanical properties.12 Relaxation of the outer layers is
in response to the loss of neighbors, consequently, the
atoms in the vicinity of the surface increase the inter-
action strength with the remaining neighbors. This bon-
dorder effect changes the equilibrium distances between
neighboring atoms, and hence residual stress occurs. The
tight-binding second moment approximation (TB-SMA)
interatomic potential is adopted in the present study for its
capability to include the bond-order effect. Through anal-
ysis of equilibrium thermal vibrations, one can obtain the
mechanical properties of the ﬁlms.
In the present work, molecular dynamics simulations are
performed to study the mechanical properties of ultrathin,
selfsupported copper ﬁlms through analysis of the thermal
ﬂuctuations. Time histories of the atomic positions due
to the thermal ﬂuctuations and the corresponding Fourier
spectrums are utilized to study the resonant structures of
the ﬁlms. Young’s modulus and residual stress of the ﬁlms
are calculated and compared.

r is assumed to be uniform along the thickness
direction and deﬁned as T /h The symbols r and  denote
polar coordinates. This continuum model is often referred
to as the classical plate theory (CPT) in the elastodynamic
theory. We remark that, based on the Kirchhoff assump-
tions, Eq. (1) is valid only for thin plates with a thickness-
to-radius ratio smaller than 0.1 (i.e., h/a < 0.1). Solutions
to Eq. (1) are of the form

where n is the circumferential number, describing the

The fundamental frequency of the thin plate is obtained
by imposing clamped boundary conditions on the outer
edge of the plate at r = a, i.e., w = w/r = 0. Reso-

onant frequencies (i.e., the roots of the combination of
Jn and In, nj j = 123   	 in Eq. (3). Note that 1n
and 2n are in units of reciprocal length. The resonant
modes associated with n= 0 are -independent, giving the
axisymmetric behavior of the vibrating plate. As for the
effects of the T and E parameters on the resonant fre-
quencies, it can be shown that the T parameter uniformly
shifts frequency spectrum horizontally for all peaks, while
the E parameter shifts resonant peaks proportional to their
frequencies. The two parameters (T and E	 are manually
adjusted so that best ﬁts on resonant frequencies can be
obtained.
In the present study, the Poisson’s ratio is assumed to be
0.34 in the determination of Young’s modulus. For com-
parison,  = 07, according to Ref. [10], is also used to
study the effects of  on E. Continuum “thickness” (or
nominal thickness) of the ﬁlm is determined using the
known atomic mass and diameter of each simulated ﬁlm so
that the “thickness” is calculated to match the mass density
of bulk copper (8960 kg/m3	. We acknowledge that the
density of nanoscale system may not necessarily be iden-
tical to its bulk counterpart, however, this way of choosing
the nominal thickness provides a reference for estimation
of continuum physical quantities.
3. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS
Circular copper thin ﬁlms with thicknesses of 3, 6 and
9 atomic layers and radius a= 90, 180 and 270 Å, respec-
tively, are simulated. The three models contain separately
11722, 93729 and 316333 copper atoms. Films with thick-
nesses of 4, 5, and 7 atomic layers of copper and radii
being 90 Å are also constructed and studied for thickness
effect analysis. The radius of a Cu atom is 1.28 Å, and the
fcc lattice parameter of bulk copper, 3.61 Å, is used in the
MD simulation. However, it is reminded that the lattice
parameters in nanoscale system are always different from
the bulk ones because of the relaxation of the atoms in the
vicinity of the free surfaces on the nanoscale structure.10
Films are constructed such that they are normal to (100)
crystal plane, i.e., the [001] direction is along the thick-
ness of the ﬁlm in the z direction. The plane of the ﬁlm is

multiple atoms in the circular ﬁlm for its thermal vibrations, in which the
ﬁrst 9 modes are indicated with numbering. Multiple atoms are required
for identifying resonant modes of the ﬁlm.
and each curve indicates the frequency spectrum of an
atom in the ﬁlm We remark that the Fourier spectrums of
atoms on each layer of the ﬁlm are consistent with each
other, even though the atoms through the thickness are not
equivalent and may behave differently due to the presence
of free surfaces in small scale systems.
In the analysis Young’s modulus of the copper ﬁlm was
found to be in the order of tens of GPa and residual stress
in the order of a few GPa. However, these values are
affected by the deﬁnitions of thickness (or mass density)
and Poisson’s ratio of the ﬁlm. Figure 3 shows the effects
of the thickness and Poisson’s ratio on estimating Young’s
modulus of the ﬁlm. Underestimating the thickness would
increase the Young’s modulus. Overestimating the Pois-
son’s ratio would decrease the Young’s modulus. From the
nominal thicknesses of the three ﬁlms, it can be seen that
Young’s modulus decreases with increasing thickness.

onant frequencies of the 90-Å radius ﬁlms with various

thicknesses (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 atomic layers) calculated
from the elastodynamic theory with prestress are shown in
Figure 4, as well as the prediction from the MD simula-
tions. The continuum parameters, including the modulus
(E= 765 GPa) and residual force (T =
rh= 1747 N/m),
of the 3-layered ﬁlm are used for the elastodynamic solu-
tions. If one assumes that thickness does not play a role in
the elastic properties of the ﬁlms, the prediction of the con-
tinuum model should be in good agreement with the MD
results. Yet, only is the trend consistent with each other.
To obtain better agreement both in trend and predicted res-
onant frequencies, each ﬁlm requires its own set of E and
T , as will be discussed later along with Table I. In compar-
ison, elastodynamic plate theory without prestress predicts
a linear relationship between the lowest resonant frequency

Elastic Properties of Self-Supported Circular Thin Copper Films Calculated from Equilibrium Thermal Vibration Chang and Hwang
view of that the lattice parameters in nanoscale system
are always different from the bulk ones due to the relax-
ation of the free surfaces on the ﬁlm10 and the clamped
outer edge of the circular ﬁlm would keep from the change
of equilibrium distances between neighboring atoms. The
prediction of Young’s modulus and residual stress of the
ultrathin copper ﬁlms in MD simulation may be of value
for NEMS design using continuum models.
We remark the connection between discreteness and
continuum as follows. In the present study, the highest fre-
quency that we are able to resolve is about at the value of
300 GHz. To achieve a higher frequency range, it is neces-
sary to increase the total simulation time, and hence more
computation time. However, due to the discrete nature
of the atomic system, with the assumption of 100 GPa
for Young’s modulus of the ﬁlm, a resonant frequency of
300 GHz would have a wavelength of 13.6 Å, calculated
from Eq. (5)2. As to a resonant frequency of 1000 GHz,
the wave length becomes 7.5 Å, which is about twice of
the lattice parameter. Hence, although the continuum the-
ory could predict high frequency modes in any order, the
discrete lattice may not be able to deform in such a way
that violates geometric constraint when frequency is sufﬁ-
ciently large. In other words, the limit on the highest res-
onant mode of a continuum depends on the crystal lattice.
6. CONCLUSIONS
The resonant frequencies of the ultrathin copper ﬁlm with
the number of atomic layers equal to or more than three
are obtained from the time history of atomic thermal vibra-
tion via the molecular dynamics simulation. The frequen-
cies depend non-monotonically on the thickness of the
ﬁlms due to the effects of residual stress. In the study
the residual stress in the ﬁlm is originated from the use
of bulk lattice parameter in the MD simulation. By this
way, Young’s modulus was found to be about 76.5 GPa
for the 3-layered copper ﬁlm, which is about 82% smaller
than that for bulk copper. The value of Young’s modu-
lus increases with increasing thickness of the ﬁlm and the
residual stress decreases with increasing thickness, indi-
cating the size effect in the nanoscale system.

simplifying assumptions. Albeit with the simplifications, not many exact solutions for 2D
plate models are available, among which Levy’s solutions [1] for rectangular plates are well
known. Recently, Yao and Yang [10], Lim et al. [11, 12], and Zhong et al. [13] reformulated
Kirchhoff’s and Reissner’s plate equations into a symplectic elasticity setting [14] and were
able to obtain a number of exact 2D solutions for bending and free vibration of rectangular
plates.
The validity of a 2D plate theory should be assessed by comparing the 2D solution for
the problem with its 3D counterpart. Yet, 3D elasticity solutions for plates are available
only for fully simply-supported plates [15–19]. Essentially, the solutions were obtained by
assuming a specific form of double Fourier series that satisfy the fully simply-supported
edge boundary conditions a priori, and then making it satisfy the equations of elasticity. For
rectangular plates with edge conditions other than fully simply supported, it is not possible
to determine the 3D solution for an elastic plate by presuming the solution form for the
problem.
In this paper, we develop a state space approach for exact analysis of rectangular or-
thotropic plates by treating the plate as a 3D elastic body. The formulation is developed on
the basis of the Hamiltonian state space formalism for anisotropic elasticity [20–26]. By
means of Legendre’s transformation in classical mechanics [27, 28], the basic equations of
elasticity are formulated into the state space framework in which the state equation and the
output equation are expressed in terms of the state vector that comprises the displacements
and associated stresses as the dual variables. A salient feature of the formulation is that
the state equation of the problem exhibits Hamiltonian characteristics and the associated
eigensystem possesses symplectic orthogonality, which provide an essential basis for using
eigenfunction expansion to determine the solution. Upon delineating the symplectic charac-
teristics of the system and their physical implications, 3D elasticity solutions for rectangular
orthotropic plates with two opposite edges simply supported and the other two arbitrary—
which can be any combinations of simply-supported, clamped, and traction-free edges—are
determined by using separation of variables and symplectic eigenfunction expansion in a
systematic way. It is shown that the existing 3D solution for the fully simply-supported
rectangular plate is recovered within the context. The through-thickness variations of the
displacements and stresses are evaluated by comparing the present solutions with their 2D
counterparts.
The purpose of the present work is two-fold. First to illustrate the application of the
Hamiltonian state space approach to 3D analysis of elastic plates. Second to assess the clas-
sical 2D solutions for rectangular orthotropic plates in the light of 3D elasticity solutions.
Examining the nature of corner singularities of a rectangular plate is beyond the scope of
the present study.

conditions (13)–(17) can be satisfied in a similar way.
Equation (32) exists a non-trivial solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix
vanishes. This condition gives a transcendental equation that yields infinitely many eigen-
values μnm (n,m = 1,2, . . .). It will be shown in Sect. 6 that the eigenvalues appear in
(μnm,−μnm) pairs. To each eigenvalue there corresponds an eigenvector determined from
(32) within an unknown constant (denoted by Cnm). A linear combination of the solutions

The solution given by (38)–(39) takes the form of double Fourier series, which satisfies
the fully simply-supported edge boundary conditions as well as the 3D equations of elas-
ticity. Such a solution form is assumed outright in the existing 3D solutions for rectangular
plates with fully simply-supported edges [15, 16, 18, 19]. As such, the remaining task is to
determine the constants in the series by satisfying the boundary conditions on the top and
bottom faces, which is easily done by using Fourier series expansion.
For the cases other than the fully simply supported plate, the solution is not that straight-
forward since the eigensolutions of the problem are not in the form of the Fourier series; it is
necessary to derive the orthogonality relations of the eigenvectors, which are indispensable
in using eigenfunction expansion to determine the unknown constants in the series solution
given by (33)–(34). In what follows, we shall delineate the Hamiltonian characteristics and
symplectic orthogonality of the eigensystem given by (21).
6 Hamiltonian Characteristics of the System
To facilitate exposition, let us express (21) with the homogeneous edge boundary conditions
as
Hψ = μψ, B(ψ) = 0, (40)
where μ is the eigenvalue, ψ is the associated eigenvector, and
H =
[
L11 L12
L21 −L∗11
]
, ψ =
[
u˜
σ˜ z
]
.
The system matrix H in (40) exhibits the feature of a Hamiltonian matrix such that the
operator matrix L∗11 is the adjoint of L11, and the operator matrices L12 and L21 are self-
adjoint. Such a feature is essential for the development that follows.
First of all, the adjoint system of (40) is
Hφ = −μφ, B(φ) = 0, (41)
where the star ∗ denotes the adjoint, φ is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue −μ,
and
φ =
[
v
τ
]
, v =
⎡
⎣
v1(x, y)
v2(x, y)
v3(x, y)
⎤
⎦ , τ =
⎡
⎣
τ13(x, y)
τ23(x, y)
τ33(x, y)
⎤
⎦ .
Derivation of (41) begins with the equality

where

, I is the 3 × 3 identity matrix.

Multiplying (47) by ψT−nmJ and ψTnmJ, respectively, integrating the resulting equations
over the x–y domain, with the symplectic orthogonality, we obtain
Cnm =
∫ b

where n,m = 1,2,3, . . . .
Likewise, from (48)

. (52)
Combining (49)–(50) and (51)–(52), we arrive at a system of two integral equations:
∫ b

∫ a

ψT−nmJ
[
F(x, y,0) − e−μnmhF(x, y,h)]dxdy

∫ a
0
ψTnmJ
[
eμnmhG(x, y,h) − G(x, y,0)]dxdy, (54)
where the terms on the right-hand sides are completely known, the unknown functions are
the displacement components u(x, y, z), v(x, y, z) and w(x,y, z) at z = 0, h in F(x, y,0)
and F(x, y,h).

8 Results and Discussions
First, the solution for the problem according to the classical plate theory (CPT) are reca-
pitulated [1, 2]. The governing equation for the transverse displacement w0(x, y) of the
midplane of a rectangular orthotropic plate under transverse load q3(x, y) is
D11
∂4w0
∂x4
+ 2 (D12 + 2D66)Dc ∂
4w0
∂x2∂y2

= q3(x, y), (58)

, c˜ij = cij − ci3cj3/c33.
The solution to (58) with simply-supported edges at x = 0 and x = a can be determined
by letting
w0(x, y) =
∞∑
n=1
Wn(y) sin
nπx
a
, (59)
where Wn(y) is an unknown function of y. Upon substituting (59) into (58) and expressing
q3(x, y) in the Fourier series, (58) reduces to an ordinary differential equation which is
solvable in an elementary way. By imposing the edge conditions at y = 0 and y = b to
determine the unknown constants, one obtains the CPT solution for the problem. This is the
essence of Levy’s solution for bending of elastic plates.
To evaluate quantitatively the difference between the 2D plate solution and the 3D elas-
ticity solution, the following elastic constants for orthotropic materials are taken for com-
putation: EL/ET = 2, GLT /ET = 0.6, GTT /ET = 0,5 and νLT = νT T = 0.25, where the
subscripts L and T denote longitudinal and transverse to the fiber direction. These values
are typical for glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy composite materials. The fiber direction is
align with the y-axis. To compare with the solution of classical thin plate theory, thickness-
to-span ratios h/a = 0.1,0.5, and aspect ratios b/a = 1,2,5 are considered. The plate is
subjected to the transverse load: q3 = −q0 sinπx/a, q1 = q2 = p1 = p2 = p3 = 0.
Variations of the displacements and stresses are evaluated by taking M terms in the eigen-
function expansion. Convergent results were obtained by taking no more than 40 terms of the
series at locations away from the edge. To evaluate the stresses near the edge, it is necessary
to take up to 50 terms of the series.
Figures 1 and 2 compare the CPT solution with the 3D solution for the midplane deflec-
tion of a thin plate (h/a = 0.1) and a thick plate (h/a = 0.5) with aspect ratio b/a = 2 along
the y-axis for x = 0.5a under various edge conditions at y = 0, b. The CPT solution gives
good approximation on the displacement distribution in thin plates, whereas the differences
between the CPT and 3D solution are very large in thick plates, as shown in Tables 1 and 2
in which the error percentage between the two solutions is defined as (WCPT −W3D)/W3D .
The difference between the CPT and 3D solutions increases as the thickness-to-span ra-
tio (h/a or h/b) increases, reaching as high as 78.3% for the case where h/a = 0.5 and
b/a = 1. The effects of the edge conditions at y = 0, b is not significant as the aspect ratio
(b/a) increases.

1. Introduction 
In a system of nano thin film, relaxation of the 
free surfaces would induce significant residual 
stress which leads to changes in bulk mechanical 
properties [1]. Relaxation of the outer layers is 
resulting from the loss of neighboring atoms, 
consequently, the atoms in the vicinity of the 
surface increase the interaction strength with the 
remaining neighbors. In this work, we performed 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations associated 
with the classical plate theory (CPT) with pre-
stress to study the mechanical property of copper 
thin films [2]. Size effects in the mechanical 
property of the films are discussed. 
 
2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation 
Circular copper thin films with thicknesses h 
of 3, 6 and 9 atomic layers and radius a = 90, 180 
and 270 Å, respectively, are considered for MD 
simulation. The fcc lattice parameter is specified 
by 3.61 Å. Films are constructed such that the 
surface is normal to (100) crystal plane. Clamped 
edge condition is applied at r = a. All simulations 
are performed at the temperature of 300K. 
The resonant frequencies ωn of a thin plate 
with clamped edge at r = a are determined by the 
transcendental characteristic equation: 
 
κ 2n Jn (κ1na)In+1(κ 2na) + κ1n Jn+1(κ1na)In(κ 2na) = 0 , (1)

The residual stress σr and Young’s modulus E 
of the films are manually adjusted to fit the 
resonant frequencies obtained from the MD 
simulations. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
As shown in Table 1, six resonant modes are 
used to ensure the validity of the fitting between 
the MD simulation and the CPT theory. The 
reduction in Young’s modulus is consistent with 
other MD simulations via uniaxial loading in the 
literatures [3]. The residual stresses are in accord 
with the atomic stress calculations by the virial 
theorem. This phenomenon is originated from the 
relaxation of the free surfaces on the films having 
specified lattice parameter (3.61Å) and clamped 
edge. The decrease of Young’s modulus and 
increase of residual stress are primarily due to the 
microstructure of the thin films.
