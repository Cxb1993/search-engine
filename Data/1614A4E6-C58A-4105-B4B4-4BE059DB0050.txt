ordinal observation set that observed in accordance of time of a dynamic system. Such data 
measuring the traffic stream characteristics such as traffic flow, speed and lane occupancy are 
recorded by various types of vehicle detectors and are widely available on freeway and 
arterials for the operation and incident detection purposes. With a historical database of past 
traffic data, collected real-time traffic information can be used to estimate the current traffic 
conditions and predict the conditions in near future. Dia (2001) stated that there are basically 
two distinct categories of predictive traffic information: strategic and short-term. The 
difference between strategic and short-term traffic information is the length of the forecasting 
horizon. Traditional strategic predictive models usually utilize a large amount of data and 
predict over a period of month or year which is needed for making decisions on transportation 
planning. On the other hand, short-term predictive models often forecast traffic conditions 
within a day or an hour that captures the dynamics of traffic, therefore, short-term forecasting 
models are more suitable for traffic management and information systems. 
 
A wide variety of studies have been done concerning the short-term forecasting during the 
past decades. Vlahogianni et al. (2004) gave a comprehensive overview on the topic, and they 
concluded that the modeling methodologies and outputs could be quite different with the 
scope of each study. In general, the widely used predict models can be classified into two 
techniques: parametric and non-parametric modeling. Parametric techniques assume a form of 
probability distribution with parameters, such as smoothing (Smith and Demetsky, 1997), 
ARIMA (Ghosh et al., 2005), Bayesian SARIMA(Ghosh et al., 2007) and Kalman filtering 
(Stathopoulos and Karlaftis, 2003; Whittaker et al., 1997). Non-parametric techniques include 
non-parametric regression (Smith et al., 2002) and neural networks (Dougherty and Cobbett, 
1997, Ledoux, 1997, Yin et al., 2002). 
 
Ghosh et al. (2005) used three different time series models to forecast traffic flow in Dublin, 
and they concluded that seasonal ARIMA outperformed random model and Holt-Winters’ 
exponential smoothing technique. Smith et al. (2002) compared seasonal ARIMA model and 
non-parametric regression coupled with heuristic forecast method for traffic volume 
forecasting and found that the later approach may not produce better result than seasonal 
ARIMA, with the argument that the traffic data is characteristically stochastic rather than 
chaotic. Ledoux (1997) proposed a cooperation based neural networks model and 
demonstrated by simulated data that neural networks can be used to predict future traffic flow 
accurately. Yin et al. (2002) developed a fuzzy-neural model to predict the traffic flows in an 
urban area.  
 
On the implementation, whereas most of the literature focused on the traffic flow prediction 
on the freeways, modeling traffic flow in urban arterials is more challenging as there are 
disturbances such as motorcycles and traffic signals in urban area. As the two problems are 
fundamentally different, an accurate estimation and prediction should involve the theory of 
the traffic flow along the arterials. In this study, the traffic flow forecasting for urban arterials 
is investigated. Seasonal ARIMA and neural network are considered as our algorithms to be 
investigated in this initial study. Two arterials in the Taipei city, Taiwan, were studied in our 
numerical examples. 
 
 
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
 
In general, seasonal ARIMA and neural network are two different kinds of techniques, not

denotes the seasonality.  
 
The purpose of identifying a seasonal ARIMA model is to determine the values of p, d, q and 
P, D, Q, while the cycle length L is usually given explicitly. In our study, we utilized the 
statistical software Minitab15 (2009) to compute the autocorrelation function and partial 
autocorrelation function so as to identify these values. 
 
2.2 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
 
Abundant applications of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be found in the literature. To 
briefly describe the background, ANN is an information processing system that imitate neural 
network. It can be used for problems which are non-linear, with high dimensions, or lack of a 
clear statement of mathematic formulation. A neural network consists of a set of processing 
units, also known as neurons. These units can receive inputs from other neurons and compute 
outputs using transfer function. Neurons are connected to each other by weighted connections, 
thus the information can be transmit based on the value of weight. 
 
Generally any topological arrangement of neurons could be used. However, a Multilayer 
Perceptron (MLP) with hidden layer is in common use. In order to simplify the problems of 
analysis it is usually arranged in layers, with every neurons in adjacent layers connected to 
each other. This network is a typical feedforward network (see Figure 1). 
 
Figure 1 A typical feedforward network 
 
As above mentioned that there are some relationship between the inputs of neurons and their 
outputs, so we can assume that the output yj of neuron j is a function of its inputs x0, x1, …, xn, 
shown in equations as follow. 
 )( ji
iijj xWfy θ−= ∑              (6) 
where f is non-linear transfer function, Wij is the weight value representing the strength 
between neuron i and neuron j, and jθ is the bias, only if input multiply weight value is greater 
than bias can be transfer to other neurons. 
 
The operating process of neural network composes of two stages, training and recalling. A 
training procedure that connection weights be updated over time, causing the neural network 
to adapt and learn is needed. A rule that define how and when the connection weights are 
updated is a learning rule. The learning process of feedforward network in our research is a 
supervised learning network. In supervised learning, output is computed after an example of 
input presented to one side of feedforward network. To move the output toward the desired

To fit the seasonal ARIMA model, we consider the traffic data from the downstream detectors 
on each road, i.e. VPLKP40 for JianGuo Overpass and VMTG520 for Minsheng W. Road,. 
We used software Minitab 15 to calculate the seasonal ARIMA model. The time series plot of 
the volume reveals that the data has the seasonality every 96 observations, i.e. data in one day. 
To transfer the time series data into stationary series, some form of (p, 0, q)(P, 1, Q)96 of the 
seasonal ARIMA model will fit for the traffic data. The results of the estimation with several 
reasonable combinations of parameters (p, q, P and Q) for the seasonal ARIMA model are 
shown in Table 1 and 2. Autocorrelation and partial correlation functions indicated that the 
process must be AR1 or AR2. Besides, MA1 or MA2 also seemed to be a possible seasonal 
component.  
 
For the detector VPLKP40, we found that the modeling parameters (2,0,1)(0,1,1)96 and 
(2,0,0)(0,1,1)96 best fit the traffic conditions on JianGuo Overpass with the smallest MSE 
(mean squared error) values of 1196, as shown in Table 1.

(0,0,2)(0,1,1)96 0 0 -0.456 -0.075 0 0.582 1204 
 
The volume data from 21st July and 23rd July 2009 are then used for the validation purpose. 
With the above model parameters, we forecasted 96 future observations with (2,0,1)(0,1,1)96 
and compared them with observations of the 21st and 23rd, as shown in Figure 3(a) and Figure 
3(b), respectively. We can see that the model fits the observations quite well during off-peak 
when the flows are low in values and the observations were not fluctuate. But the model may 
not capture the extreme peak variations when it comes to rapid fluctuations. The 
corresponding error by MSE (mean squared error) and MAPE (mean absolute percentage 
error) for VPLKP40 are shown in Table 2.

shows the estimated error of forecasting by MSE and MAPE for VMGT520. Interestingly, we 
can see that while the calibration error of Minsheng W. Road (775) is less than that of 
JianGuo Overpass (1196), the validation error is much higher, with MSE 943.58 vs 385.68 
and MAPE 12.38% vs 10.87% for 21st July observations. We can also see from Figure 4 that 
the traffic volume fluctuates during morning peak and evening peak. For one reason, the 
traffic flows on the urban arterials are disturbed by traffic signal and the length of the signal 
phases. Therefore, using the ARIMA model on urban arterials which has local variations in 
traffic volume may take further investigations.

3.3 Artificial Neural Network model 
 
The data collected from JianGuo Overpass and Minsheng W. Road were used for modeling, 
and the neural network was trained with Matlab (2009) toolbox. In our model, a two-layer 
feedforward network with 7 sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons was employed. 
As we want to see the relationship that the downstream flow coming from the upstream with a 
time lag, the output vector is the northbound traffic volume from the downstream dector, and 
the input vectors are those of the corresponding upstream detectors at the previous time step, 
on the JianGuo Overpass on Tuesday to Thursday from 30th June to 23rd July 2009.  
 
Our network divided the total 1151 samples into three sets, i.e., the first 805 samples for 
training purpose, the following 173 samples of validation data and the remaining 173 samples 
of testing data, and trained them with the default Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation 
algorithm. To evaluate the prediction performance and compare with seasonal ARIMA model, 
the MSE were used to measure the error. The error estimated for the training data and 
validation data were 1149.76 and 585.85 for detector VPLKP40. Figure 5(a) shows the 
regression plot for the detector VPLKP40. The regression analysis revealed that R for training 
data, validation data and testing data are 0.94771, 0.97209 and 0.96679, respectively. The R 
for overall data was 0.95392.  
 
To predict traffic flow on the urban arterial Minsheng W. Road with neural network, the 
westbound traffic volumes are analyzed similarly. The error estimated by MSE for the training 
data and validation data were 562.61 and 634.45 for detector VMGT520, and Figure 5(b) is 
the regression plot. The regression analysis revealed that R for training data, validation data 
and testing data are 0.95039, 0.93656 and 0.95123, respectively, and the R for overall was 
0.94864.

spatial-temporal characteristics of the network will be a direction for future studies. For 
example, the cross-correlation functions may help in finding out the dependency between 
several time series data at different locations over time. 
 
5. FINAL COMMENTS  
 
Although the submitted proposal of the project is to investigate the traffic estimation and 
forecasting problem for traffic flow and travel time, the project is only granted for one year (it 
was proposed to be two years in the study plan). Therefore, only the traffic flow estimation 
and forecasting are executed.  
 
Indeed, following the reviewer’s comments that the travel time estimation in urban arterial is 
too difficult to be success in reality because of reasons such as the disturbance of traffic signal, 
mixed traffic, as well as the malfunction issues of the vehicle detectors, the applicant further 
extended the study direction with submitting a NSC proposal on the spatial-temporal 
modeling of traffic flow, which was granted this year for a one year project.

ABSTRACT  
 
The interests and applications of short-term traffic forecasting have been growing in the 
recent years. Many of the applications in Advance Traveler Information System (ATIS) and 
Advance Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) require an estimation and forecasting of the 
traffic conditions of the network. With a historical database of past traffic data from various 
types of vehicle detectors installed in the roads, real-time traffic information is collected 
which will be used to estimate the current traffic conditions and predict the condition in near 
future. Whereas most of the literature focused on the traffic flow prediction on the freeways, 
modeling traffic flow in urban arterials is more challenging as there are disturbances such as 
motorcycles and traffic signals in urban area. In this study, the traffic flow forecasting for 
urban arterials is investigated. Seasonal ARIMA and neural network are considered as the 
algorithms, and two arterials in the Taipei city, Taiwan, are studied in our numerical example.
