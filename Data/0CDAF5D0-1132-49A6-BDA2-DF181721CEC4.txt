中文摘要
小波轉換是目前最具有研發潛力的影
像壓縮編碼技術，國際影像編碼標準 JPEG
2000 就是以小波轉換為發展基礎。目前較
具代表性的小波轉換編碼技術有： set
partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) 以
及 embedded block coding with optimized
truncation (EBCOT)，其中 SPIHT 屬樹狀結
構編碼法，EBCOT 為區塊分解編碼法。樹
狀結構編碼是把有關聯的小波係數組織成
樹狀結構後，利用小波係數在相同方向的
子頻道間存有高相關性的特點，達到壓縮
的效果。然而，影像內容若含有高頻的紋
路 (textures) 成份時，樹狀結構之零樹
(zero-tree) 小波係數群發生機率不高，影響
壓縮效果，因此有學者提出向量模式的
SPIHT 編碼 (稱之為 VSPIHT)，雖然可以
改善含有高頻紋路成份的影像壓縮效果，
但所增加的運算複雜度則降低了系統的整

Abstract
Embedded zero-tree image coding in the
wavelet domain has drawn a lot of attention.
Among noteworthy algorithms is the set
partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT).
Typically, most of images’ energy is
concentrated in the low frequency subbands.
For images with textures, however many
middle-high frequency wavelet coefficients
are likely to become significant in the early
passes of SPIHT; thus the coding results are
often insufficient. The middle and high
frequency subbands of an image may demand
a further decomposition with adaptive basis
functions. As wavelet packet transform offers
a great diversity of basis functions, we
propose an efficient method for rearranging
the wavelet packet coefficients of an image to
form hierarchical trees, by which the well
known SPIHT algorithm can be applied
directly. For images with textures, the high
frequency wavelet coefficients are likely to
become significant after several code passes
of SPIHT, which degrades substantially the
coding performance. As a result, the high
frequency wavelet coefficients representing
most of the high detail content of images
need to be decomposed into wavelet packet
coefficients for a further exploitation. The
proposed rearrangement scheme has been
applied to the highest frequency wavelet
packet coefficients of images. Experimental
results show that the performance of SPIHT
can be improved, especially for fingerprint
images.

II.2 Review of Wavelet Packet Transform
Wavelet transform is focused on the low
frequency decomposition, i.e. only the
scaling coefficients are successively
decomposed. As a result, wavelet transform
may not be suitable for images with large
regions of textures. However, both the
scaling coefficients and wavelet coefficients
can be decomposed, which leads to the
so-called wavelet packet transform (WPT).
Similarly, 2-D WPT can be obtained by the
tensor product of 1-D WPT. Figure 2(a)
shows a 3-level 2-D WPT, where the wavelet
coefficients: ),(31 nmD and ),(
3
2 nmD are
decomposed further into wavelet packets.
II.3 Review of SPIHT
In wavelet domain, the related wavelet
coefficients taken from all the subbands of
the same orientation can be arranged to form
hierarchical wavelet trees. A wavelet
coefficient called parent node at a resolution
level has four related wavelet coefficients
called children nodes at the next finer
resolution level. The root node is at the
coarsest resolution level and the leaf nodes
are at the finest resolution level. Figure 1(b)
shows a wavelet tree in the diagonal
orientation. Images are usually composed of
homogeneous regions, textures and a small
portion of edges, which are typically the low,
middle and high frequency components,
respectively. Most of the significant wavelet
coefficients of homogeneous regions are at
the coarser resolution levels, i.e. in the lower
frequency subbands, whereas the significant
wavelet coefficients representing the
noticeable textures and edges are at the finer
resolution levels, i.e. in the higher frequency
subbands.
The wavelet based SPIHT algorithm has
received a lot of attention since its
introduction in 1996. In SPIHT, two code
passes, namely sorting pass and refinement
pass are involved, which can be combined to
form a single scan pass. Three code symbols,
namely zero tree (ZT), insignificant pixel (IP)
and significant pixel (SP) are utilized to code
the wavelet trees of an image. These symbols
are stored in their respective lists, i.e. list of
insignificant sets (LIS), list of insignificant
pixels (LIP) and list of significant pixels
(LSP). In sorting pass, tree nodes stored in
LIS and LIP are evaluated as follows. For a
node with magnitude greater than the current
threshold, it becomes significant and then is
stored in LSP. For an insignificant node with
respect to the current threshold, if all the
descendants are also insignificant, it is stored
in LIS; otherwise, it is stored in LIP. In
refinement pass, the significant nodes are
refined with one bit per node to update their
respective magnitudes. The basic idea behind
SPIHT is as follows. If a parent node is
insignificant, all the descendants are likely to
be insignificant and therefore they can be
coded efficiently by a single code symbol:
ZT.
III. Proposed Wavelet Packet Trees
In the framework of SPIHT with
wavelet trees, the spatially related wavelet
coefficients are organized into hierarchical
trees. Typicaly, most of images’ energy is 
concentrated in the lower frequency subbands,
i.e. at the upper tree levels, and decreases in
magnitude from top to bottom. However, for
images with high detail textures, many
significant wavelet coefficients are
distributed in the high frequency subbands.
Thus, instead of wavelet functions, other
basis functions might be more suitable for
coding the high frequency components of
images.
III.1 Image Coding with Both Wavelets
and Wavelet Packets
High quality image compression at low
bit rates can be achieved by representing the
low frequency and high frequency
6)1( bTb such that all the low frequency
wavelet coefficients and high frequency
wavelet packet coefficients are in the range
of ]2,2[ 11 TT .
Wavelet packet tree construction: Rearrange
wavelet packet coefficients using the
proposed 1-D rearrangement scheme (Figure
3(a)) horizontally followed by vertically, or
vice versa. These rearranged wavelet packet
coefficients together with the low frequency
wavelet coefficients can be grouped to form
the wavelet packet trees of an image.
Sorting pass: Identify the significant wavelet
and wavelet packet coefficients by comparing
their respective magnitudes to the current
threshold bT . If a coefficient becomes
significant, output the sign bit.
Refinement pass: Output the refinement of
the significant coefficients by 1 bit per
coefficient.
The sorting pass followed by refinement
pass with a sequence of successively smaller
thresholds, which can be obtained by
2/1 bb TT  , is performed repeatedly until the
bit budget is exhausted. Note that the
constructed wavelet packet trees are still
quad trees and therefore the proposed
rearrangement scheme is efficient as well as
suitable for quad-tree image coding. To
decompress an image, the embedded code
stream is first decoded into wavelet
coefficients and wavelet packet coefficients.
The high frequency wavelet packet
coefficients are then rearranged by using the
inverse 1-D rearrangement (shown in Figure
3(b)) vertically followed by horizontally, or
vice versa. Finally, the decoded image can be
obtained through inverse wavelet packet
transform.
IV. Experimental Results
In the proposed quad-tree image coding
with both wavelets and wavelet packets, the
highest frequency wavelet coefficients are
presumably decomposed twice to generate
wavelet packet coefficients. These highest
frequency wavelet packet coefficients are
then rearranged by using the proposed
rearrangement scheme, and together with the
low frequency wavelet coefficients, the
wavelet packet trees of an image can be
constructed. The coding results of images
Sailboat on lake, Fingerprint, Earth and San
Francisco are presented in this paper. The
aforesaid images are shown in Figure 4. The
coding performance of the proposed method
is compared to SPIHT with wavelet trees.
The compression rate is measured in bits per
pixel (bpp). The distortion is measured by the
peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The
computed bit rates and PSNR values are
collected to generate the rate distortion
curves. Daubechies orthogonal wavelet with
4-tap filters is used. The number of
decomposition levels is 5.
For images Sailboat on lake and
Fingerprint, Table 1 shows the numbers of
significant wavelet and wavelet packet
coefficients in the highest frequency
subbands, bit-plane by bit-plane from most to
least significant. The number of significant
coefficients is reduced starting from the 7th
and 6th bit-plane, respectively. As one might
expect, the coding performance of SPIHT can
be improved significantly by rearranging the
highest frequency wavelet packet coefficients
through the proposed scheme. Fig. 5 and Fig.
6 show the rate distortion curves, where the
horizontal and vertical axes are the bit rates
and PSNR values, respectively.
For a satellite image of Earth and an
aerial image of San Francisco, Table 2 shows
the numbers of significant wavelet and
wavelet packet coefficients in the highest
frequency subbands. The number of
significant coefficients is reduced
significantly starting from the 9th and 7th
bit-plane, respectively. As there is a large
portion of high detail textures in these images,
many wavelet coefficients in the highest
frequency subbands are likely to become
significant after several code passes of
SPIHT, and therefore the proposed method is
suitable for coding such images, as shown in
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.
