where ν  is the kinematic viscosity of fluid occupying the space be-

To complete the mathematical formulation, we specify the bound-
ary conditions as follows. A no-slip condition is prescribed on the 
lower plate and cylinder surfaces. The upper plate moves at a constant 
velocity u = Ui. In addition, a linear velocity profile,

is prescribed at the far upstream and downstream boundaries. In un-
steady flow computations, we employed the computed steady solution 
as the initial conditions and integrated in time to obtain the flow devel-
opment.

NUMERICAL DISCRETIZATION 
For computations, we employed a finite volume method with the 
SIMPLE scheme, proposed by Patankar (1980). This method uses a 
staggered grid for pressure and velocity fields. Since the computation 
procedure has been a standard one, the details are omitted here. For 
further discussions on discretization, see, e.g. Anderson (1995). 
Furthermore, the flow domain must be truncated in computations. 
Amick (1978) has shown that disturbances induced by the cylinder 
decay exponentially both upstream and downstream from the cylinder. 
This property establishes a solid background for us to truncate the 
computation domain and prescribe an undisturbed velocity distribution 
at some finite distances upstream and downstream of the cylinder. Fur-
thermore, since the disturbance decay is exponential, it is eligible to 
compute solutions in a small domain without significantly distorting 
the flow development. In the present study, we set wL 5.11 =  and 
wL 32 =  for steady computations and wL 5.11 =  and wL 82 =  for un-
steady computations. 
The mesh in the present study was generated through the commer-
cial package GRIDGEN. We employed an O-type mesh around the 
cylinder, which was embedded in another H-type mesh. Two different 
meshes have been specifically designed according to the position of 
cylinder. Fig. 2 schematically shows these two types of typical mesh 
structures around the cylinder. The grid shown in Fig. 2(a) is the one 
we used when the cylinder is far away from the lateral wall. However, 
when the cylinder is close to the wall, the mesh shown in Fig. 2(b) was 
instead employed in order to maintain grid orthogonality and proper 
aspect ratios.  
A grid-independence study shows that it is sufficiently adequate 
for different values of B to employ meshes of grid numbers being about 
150,000-170,000. 
 
SOME RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The present study focuses on the emergences and developments of 
recirculating flows attached and detached to the cylinder. To bring forth 
a clear picture of their developments, we carried out a series of careful 
computations for different values of B  and A . The former varies from 
0.1 to 0.5 with an increment of 0.1 and the latter at a multiple of 0.2 
from 0. It is noted that in all cases, the cylinder is moved toward the 
moving plate if 0≠A . 
 
Attached Recirculating Regions 
Due to the asymmetric velocity distribution of the incoming flow, 
there exists no symmetric twin-vortices structure behind the cylinder. 
Instead, a single recirculating region attached to the cylinder first ap-
pears as the Reynolds number increases from 0.  
To characterize the eddy, we defined aL  as the length of the recir-
culating region attached to the cylinder. This length extends horizon-
tally from the farthest point of the eddy to the point on the cylinder 
surface. Through computations, it is interesting to find that the relation 
of aL  to Re is linear. Fig. 3 shows an example for B = 0.3 and A = 0.4. 
The characteristic of linearity enables us to extrapolate and easily find 
the critical Reynolds number at which the recirculating region begins to 
appear. The results for various values of B and A are shown in Table 1 
and Fig. 4. For the case of geometrically symmetric setting (A = 0), the

the cylinder is 0.05w. Fig. 10 show the streamline patterns at Reynolds 
numbers somewhat smaller and larger than its onset value for B = 0.3 
and A = 0.6. In this situation, the size of the cylinder-attached eddy 
becomes large and the flow pattern has a strong reversing just before 
the detached eddy appears. 
Second, we found that at B = 0.5 and A = 0.2, the detached and at-
tached vortices almost appear simultaneously. In all other cases, the 
attached one always forms at a Reynolds number much smaller than 
that for the detached one. 
 
Special Flow Patterns 
In addition to the typical flow pattern shown in Figs. 8 and 9, there 
are two special computed phenomena observed for the formation of the 
cylinder-detached eddy. The first one appears in the geometric setting 
with B = 0.4 and A = 0.4. At the beginning of its emergence when the 
Reynolds number is slightly larger than the onset value, the detached 
eddy appears on the high-speed side of the cylinder. This is predictable 
in that the attached eddy occupies the low-speed region. However, at 
some higher Reynolds number, the attached and detached eddies inter-
change their positions to the other side. This interchange of region oc-
cupation is shown in Fig. 11. At Re = 60, the attached eddy is on the 
low-speed side behind the cylinder as shown in Fig. 11(a). However, at 
Re = 70, it moves to the high-speed side as shown in Fig. 11(b). The 
interchange occurs at a Reynolds number between 60 and 70. The 
physical mechanism of interchange is not clear. 
The other case appears at B = 0.5 and A = 0.18-0.26. It has been 
pointed out in the previous section that the attached eddy first appears 
in the high-speed region. As the detached eddy appears and grows in 
the low-speed region, their occupying regions soon interchange when 
the sizes of both eddies become comparable. The streamline patterns 
before and after interchange are depicted in Fig. 12 for the case of B = 
0.5 and A = 0.2. It is quite interesting to find that the interchange occurs 
at a Reynolds number, again, between 60 and 70.
