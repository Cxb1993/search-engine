 Chapter1. Introduction 
1.1 Introduction 
    The signal’s propagation speed through the integrated circuits has gradually 
improved over the past decade as a result of devices becoming smaller and faster. 
From Table 1.11, the typical gate length of a MOSFET has been projected to be 0.1μ
m and 0.05μm in 2006 and 2012 respectively. In the mean time, the device density in 
chips increases. Interconnects, are found to decrease in size and increase in density 
accordingly. The switching speed of integrated circuits has been rising due to the 
dimensional scaling-down of transistors. In early days, the transistor switching speed 
has largely determined the speed of the IC circuit. In present days, the transmission 
parameters of other signal carrying elements are becoming equally or even more 
important. Current Al interconnects are facing problems due to 
electron-transport-induced mechanical stress, leading to Al-crystal migration and 
finally interrupted interconnects. It is expected that copper interconnects will perform 
much better. Copper has much less resistance than aluminum, resulting in a smaller 
time delay factor (τ) in the equationτ=R×C; the lower resistance found in copper 
results in smaller delays. Typically, using copper instead of aluminum reduces 
interconnect resistance by 40% (see Figure1.12), resulting in better signal integrity, 
smaller propagation delays, lower power dissipation, and higher performance. The 
electromigration properties of copper are also better than those of aluminum. 
Therefore, these factors make copper a better metal choice.

2. Withstand thermal stress to at least 400℃. 
3. Superior chemical stability, particularly with respect to adjacent materials. 
4. Barrier material should exhibit low film resistivity. 
5. Its thickness should be minimized for copper to occupy maximum cross section. 
6. Barrier deposited must have good coverage. 
7. Barrier film should also be a good adhesion layer for copper deposition and 
easy to remove by CMP. 
1.5 Types of diffusion barriers 
Nicolet4 classified the types of barrier into four types according to their 
mechanisms to suppress the interaction of the separated materials: 
1. Sacrificial Diffusion Barrier: A sacrificial barrier is to react with either or both of 
overlying and underlying materials during thermal processing cycles. The barrier is 
generally thick enough to endure the consumption by the end of all thermal cycles. 
Sacrificial barriers are commonly formed from pure metals and alloys. They often 
have a finite lifetime, after which no longer effective, thus they are not widely used. 
2. Stuffed Diffusion Barrier: The grain boundaries of the polycrystalline barrier act as 
diffusion pathways for atoms of overlying and underlying layers. However, if the 
grain boundaries are blocked or filled with a foreign material during deposition, 
inter-diffusion through these boundaries can be suppressed. However, the 
disadvantage is that the deposited film is often highly stressed and finally starts to 
peel and contaminate the substrate. 
3. Passive Diffusion Barrier: Passive diffusion barrier have large negative formation 
and chemically inert, strongly boned compounds; they do not react with the 
overlying or underlying materials and generally have a low solid solubility for 
 4
These choices lead to further study of various systems which comprises 
copper/barrier thin films. This can offer some general observations about transition 
metal-based barriers: 
1. Transition metals fail as barriers at lower temperatures than their nitrides. 
2. Transition metal silicides fail due to the reaction of the Si with the copper. 
The reaction is most likely to occur at the grain boundaries. 
3. Amorphous barriers offer very high reaction temperature, however, they have 
very high resistivity. 
4. The barrier properties of near noble and iron-group metal are enhanced by the 
alloying with refractory metals.  
1.7 Barrier deposition technologies 
In general, several materials, such as Ti-N,6-8 Ta-N,9-11 have been developed and 
employed in practice. These barrier layers were deposited via PVD technique, which 
is also used to form copper seed for subsequent copper electrodeposition. Copper seed 
serves as an essential nucleation base for CVD or conducting layer for subsequent 
copper electrodeposition. Seed layer can also enhance the adhesion between copper 
and underlying barrier layer, whereby the reliability of copper wiring structure is 
improved. With increasing degree of integration, however, difficulties arise in forming 
uniform thin film over fine patterned structures with high aspect ratios due to the 
limitation of the technique of sputtering. Although some researchers believed that 
ionized PVD or CVD will be the solution for poor step coverage, the cost to maintain 
a vacuum ambient for manufacturing is expensive and time-consuming, and it 
involves more than one processing step. In addition, the resistivity of Ta-N, the most 
reliable conventional barrier, is about 200-400 μΩ-cm. At present, although the 
fairly high resistivity of Ti-N is industrially acceptable, it may increase the RC delay

Chapter2. Electroless Nickel-based Barriers for  
Copper Interconnects 
2.1 Introduction 
     Paunovic et al.13 examined the diffusion barrier properties of electrochemically 
deposited Ni, Co, and Ni-Co alloys in the Ni(Co)/Cu binary system. The authors 
claimed that only electrolessly-deposited Ni-P, Co-P, and Ni-Co-P alloys have barrier 
properties for Cu diffusion. The amount of interdiffused Cu into 100 nm barrier film 
is less than 1 at％.  
 10
    In addition, some basic properties such as deposition rate, composition, and 
resistivity have been also studied. The cobalt ions form strong complexes with citric 
ions, therefore, trisodium citrate was used as a complexing agent. The working pH 
value of 8.9-9.0 was maintained by using a buffering system of boric acid and 
potassium hydroxide. The boric acid functioned also as a brighter. Thin films were 
deposited between 90-95 ℃. 
    An activation step by immersion of either Zn or Al wire in the solution 
eliminated the holding time and initiated the autocatalytic electroless deposition 
immediately. The Al and Zn wires were removed once deposition was initiated. In 
alkaline aqueous solution, the tungsten phosphoric acid hydrolyzes back to simple 
tungstate ions. Those tungsten-containing ions interacted with the electroless 
deposition bath that contained cobalt ions and hypophosphic acid.  
Electroless deposited Co-W-P films have been found to be effective diffusion 
barriers for copper after thermal anneal at 400–500 ℃  according to C–t 
measurements of MOS capacitors and SIMS depth profiles. The barrier properties 
may be explained by the microstructure of the films. Based on metallurgical 
examination, the film is comprised of hcp cobalt grains, sized 10–20 nm in diameter. 
The phosphorus and tungsten impurities most probably enrich the grain boundaries, 
forming a ‘stuffed’ barrier. These impurities have also been found to stabilize the hcp 
structure, delaying the phase transition to fcc by more than 80 ℃ compared to bulk 
pure cobalt. The resistivity of these films was found to decrease from 80 μΩ-cm of 
the as-deposited layer to 20μΩ-cm after thermal anneal at 700 ℃. These resistivity 
values are low compared to alternative diffusion barriers for copper. 
2.2.1.2 Co-Mo-P films 
 12
characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) for 
elemental analysis. Annealing the Ni–P deposits in nitrogen atmospheres at 
temperatures compatible with organic dielectrics for IC components, such as 
polyimide, was performed to characterise the deposits. The influence of high 
temperature processing on the barrier /bonding layer properties of selectively 
deposited electroless nickel–phosphorus alloys was investigated. The crystallisation 
behaviour of the deposits with different concentrations of co-deposited phosphorus 
was examined by DSC and PXRD. Reitveld simulation software was used to verify 
the presence of Ni and Ni- P upon heat treatment by assignment of reflections in the 
experimental data. Crystallisation was quantified in a manner similar to the analysis 
of crystallisation in polymers. It was shown that the greatest change in crystallization 
behaviour was for the deposits with the highest P content once annealed at 
temperatures above 300 ℃. The increase in crystallisation upon heat treatment was 
found to decrease the effectiveness of the Ni–P as a barrier layer material only for 
samples annealed at 400 ℃.  
2.2.2.2 Ni-B and Ni-W-B films 
Electroless Ni-B and Ni-W-B films fabricated by Osaka et al.21 were evaluated 
aiming for the application to a metal cap in the copper interconnects technology. The 
content of B and W was varied by adjusting the concentration of components in 
electroless deposition baths in order to clarify the effect of co-deposited element on 
thermal stability of the films. The thermal stability was evaluated by Auger electron 
spectroscope (AES), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and sheet resistance measurement. 
By measuring the variation in sheet resistance with annealing temperature, it was 
confirmed that the Ni-B films showed good thermal stability up to 450 ℃, whereas 
 14
to deposit Ni-Mo-P was then developed, in which the crystal structure, deposition rate 
and the composition of the Ni-Mo-P film can be controlled by the variation of 
[MoO42-]/[Ni2+], pH and temperature. The plating solution for Ni-Mo-P contained 
NiSO4(0.089mol/l) and Na2MoO4(0.0016-0.025 mol/l) for the source of metal, 
NaH2PO2(0.284 mol/l) as reducing agent, Na4P2O7(0.179 mol/l) oras complexing 
agent and NH4OH as pH adjuster/stabilizing agent A recommended operating 
condition for a low-resistivity Ni-Mo-P barrier requires pH 9.0-10.0, temperature 
80-90℃, and the [MoO42-]/[Ni2+] equal to 0.045-0.089. The resistivity of the Ni-Mo-P 
film so obtained can be as low as 25-47 μΩ-cm, much lower than that of the 
conventionally used nitride barriers. The deposition rate of the recommended 
operating condition is about 0.98-1.13μm/hr. Five different compositions of Ni-Mo-P 
film have been obtained: Ni89.5Mo2P8.5, Ni86.5Mo8.8P4.7, Ni88Mo8.5P3.5, Ni86.5Mo10.3P3.2 
and Ni87Mo9.7P3.3. The film resistivity decreases with decreasing P amount as well as 
the grain boundaries. Excessive MoO42- tends to form a Mo phase in the solid film, 
which increases the film resistivity. Ni88Mo8.5P3.5 has the lowest electrical resistivity 
among all the Ni-Mo-P barriers and it shows industrial potential when compared to 
the conventionally used nitride barriers. Still, a feasible deposition process for 
Ni-Mo-P film is in the developing stage. Besides serving as a diffusion barrier for Cu, 
Ni-Mo-P is expected to serve as a seed layer for subsequent Cu electrodeposition, 
which greatly simplifies the process. 
2.2.2.4 Ni-W-P films 
2.2.2.4.1 Phase of binary Ni-W alloy system 
    In the Ni-W binary system26, as W content is less than 30 wt.%, which is the 
solubility in Ni as illustrated in Figure 2.2, no second phase, i.e. Ni-W compound 
precipitation, in Ni-W can be found even after heat treatment.  
 16
was known that the electroless Ni-P deposits had higher microhardness than that of 
electroplated nickel. Also, the hardness of these Ni-P deposits increases with 
increasing occluded phosphorus in the alloy. It can be seen from Figure 2.3 that there 
is a significant increase in the microhardness of all Ni-W-P deposits in comparison to 
Ni-P deposit, although they are having less P contents. It indicates that the addition of 
small amounts of W provides great increase in hardness and decrease in corrosion 
resistance as compared with Ni-P film.  
2.2.2.4.5 Microstructure and thermal property 
Tsai et al.30 prepared the electroless Ni-P and ternary Ni-10wt%W-P alloys on 
420 stainless steel to evaluate the thermal property and related mechanical 
characteristics of the coating assemblies. No metastable phases were observed  and 
only slight crystallization was formed ed up to 375 ℃ in Ni-W-P alloy. The slightly 
higher crystallization temperature may be due to the lower rate of elememt diffusion 
as a result of incorporation of the higher melting point element W. The phase 
transition temperature of phosphide precipitation is raised from 348 to 380 ℃ by 
introducing tungsten into Ni-P deposit. Thus, the thermal stability of Ni-P alloy is 
improved. Beside, the co-deposition of tungsten enables the deposits to exhibit an 
amorphous structure with lower phosphorus content. They confirmed that the 
introduction of tungsten indeed reduced the linear crack length and delayed the 
cracking formation.  
2.2.2.4.6 Electrical resistivity 
A Self-assembled monolayer of N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl -trimethoxy 
silane were utilized by Osaka et al.31 as an adhesion/catalyzed layer for electroless 
Ni-W-P and Ni-Re-P. Uniform Ni-P film was attained on interlevel dielectrics SiO2 
 18
suggested that the Ni-Re-P films were feasible as diffusion barrier layers.  
2.2.2.4.8 Direct Cu deposition on seedless barrier 
    Adhesion layers for copper are composed of compounds such as TaN, TiN, or 
WN. Theses Nitride compounds have good adhesion to dielectric materials and 
provide fair barrier resistance to the diffusion of copper. However, theses nitride 
compounds also have relatively poor adhesion to copper and relatively high electrical 
resistance. The refractory metals are good barrier materials, having lower electrical 
resistance than their nitrides and good adhesion to copper. In some cases, the adhesion 
and barrier material become integral. Copper, which are deposited by electroplating 
needs a predeposited a seed layer on the barrier layer via processes such as electroless, 
physical vapor, and chemical vapor deposition. If the seed layer and the barrier layer 
are not fully bonded, interface diffusion or electromigration of seed material along the 
boundary between the layers become problematic. This is especially true with copper 
seed layer and barrier layers of TaN or WN. A solution, which would reduce overall 
barrier resistivity and increased electromigration resistance while improving 
resistance to interface diffusion, is naturally in need of.32  
    Conventional and seedless barrier processes were proposed by Merck are shown 
in Figure 2.6. The process combines barrier and seed layer to one step process. Figure 
2.7 describes possible combination of seedless barrier materials. Electroless or 
electroplated copper would be deposited on the seedless barrier without aother copper 
seed layer.  These films would provide a complete wet chemical processing sequence 
which reduce copper mobility, minimize line resistance and greatly simplify the 
process.

heat-treatment was performed at a constant 10 ℃/min heating rate o. After that, the 
specimens were cooled and ready for further testing.  
2.4.5 Characterization and measurement 
2.4.5.1 Surface morphology and composition analysis

40% of the spacing, and the edges of the film are more than 4 times the spacing

2.5 Results and Discussions 
 30
    Bath pH is an important factor in controlling deposition rate and film 
composition of electroless Ni-W-P deposition. The effect of pH at a fixed 
[Na2WO4]( 0.1 mol/l) and bath temperature at 85 ℃ on the electroless deposition 
rate and film composition is shown in Figure 2.11. The results are similar to that for 
electroless Ni-P deposition and indicate that the deposition rate and P content increase 
with increasing pH value, whereas the W content in the deposits follows the opposite 
trend. Such behavior can be explained by the effect of OH- ions as reactants in the 
overall reaction of electroless deposition. In other words, this could be attributed to 
the increase of the driving force of the reducing agent as a result of the increase of 
pH.34 In addition to this, rising pH needs additions of ammonia solution, which is a 
type of ligands that could enhance electron transmission, thus increasing the reduction 
rate of metal ions when it is incorporated with other complexing agents.35  
2.5.1.1.3 Bath temperature effect 
    There is another important thing for electrolessly-deposited Ni-W-P film. The 
effect of operating temperature at a fixed [Na2WO4]( 0.1 mol/l) and at pH 9 on the 
electroless deposition rate and film composition is illustrated in Figure 2.12. The 
results clearly indicate that the deposition rate increases with increasing bath 
temperature and W and P content in the deposit follow the opposite trend. This 
behavior helps account for the result that the increase in the driving force of reducing 
agent leads to faster deposition rate as a result of the increase in temperature.   
 
2.5.1.1.4 Deposition time 
    The effect of deposition time at a fixed [Na2WO4]( 0.1 mol/l), pH 9 and bath 
temperature at 85 ℃ on the electroless deposition rate and film composition is 
 32
electrolessly-deposited Ni-W-P film depends heavily on the P content in the deposits, 
which is not much affected by change in pH or temperature. 
2.5.3 Electrical property  
    The film resistivity attracts special attention because of its dependence on the 
thermal stability and because it certainly has impact on application. The relationships 
between the resistivity of the deposit and operating parameters including [Na2WO4], 
pH value, and temperature as illustrated in Figures 2.18. Amorphous structure is 
generally not feasible for electron transfer, and its resistivity is high, as previous 
found in Ni-P structure. The film resistivity exists a minimal value as [Na2WO4] is 
adjusted to about 0.1 mol/l. Higher [Na2WO4] would render more W into the film and 
simultaneously less P content, which raises the resistivity. As aforesaid, Ni-W-P 
deposit layers with higher resistivity can be obtained because an increase of pH would 
render higher P content in Ni-W-P film. The resistivity of the film declines with 
increasing temperature. It is expected that the reaction rate of electroless deposition is 
too slow and incomplete to form a continuous film at lower temperature while the 
resistivity slightly decrease at higher temperature. An additional advantage of Ni-W-P 
film is its low resistivity compared to diffusion barriers such as TiN 37(>100μΩ-cm), 
TaN38 (>2500μΩ-cm) and ternary amorphous alloys such as Ti–Si–N39 (>700μΩ
-cm). 
2.5.4 Effect of heat-treatment on structure and sheet resistance 
2.5.4.1 Phase identification of heat-treated Ni-W-P films 
    Electroless Ni-P films are sometimes used in their amorphous state, however, 
amorphous materials are generally unstable when exposed to high temperature, 
because they are in thermodynamically metastable state. Thermal effect was 
investigated to clarify the effect of codeposited refractory metal on the thermal 
 34
temperature. These behaviors imply that electroless Ni-W-P deposit possesses 
superior thermal stability over Ni-P deposits.   
2.5.4.2 Sheet resistance of heat-treated Ni-W-P films 
Electrical resistivity is a basic requirement for diffusion barrier. In addition to 
study the thermal stability of Ni-W-P film, the effect of heat treatment on sheet 
resistance is also important. Therefore, we did a series of thermal treatments to 
determine the thermal stability of Ni-W-P deposit and explore its feasibility to serve 
as diffusion barrier for copper interconnect. Figure 2.22 shows the effect of annealing 
temperature on the sheet resistance of the Ni-W-P alloy film. In Figure 2.22, the 
deposits were heat-treated at a constant heating rate of 10 ℃/min from room 
temperature to the desired temperature, i.e.100,150,200,250,300,350, and 400 ℃ for 
30min. The sheet resistance decreases and then slightly increases at 400 ℃. After 
annealing at 400℃ for 1,2,3hours, sheet resistance slightly decreases and then 
increases after heat treatment for above 2 hours in Figure 2.23. We found that the 
electrical property of Ni-W-P film still remain good after 400℃ heat-treatment for at 
least 1 hr. From these results, the Ni-W-P films do possess sufficient thermal stability. 
2.5.5 Electroless Ni-W-P film as Diffusion barrier  
2.5.5.1 Phase formation of Cu/Ni-W-P/Si  
It has been reported that electromigration is sensitive to the preferred-oriented of 
copper films with Cu(111) being the preferred-texture.4,41-43 Therefore, to develop a 
proper underlying barrier layer is critical. Figure 2.24 is the XRD patterns of 
Ni-W-P/Si and Cu/Ni-W-P/Si layered structure, which shows a strong peak for Cu 
(111) at 43o and another for Cu (200) at about 49o. A predominant peak for Cu(111) is 
favored because it is the  preferred-orientation for interconnection. The intensity 
ratios of Cu(111)/Cu(200) is high and similar to that by the existing process. This is a 
 36
diffusion can be found in the sample at 400 ℃, implying that Ni-W-P film has a good 
capacity to prevent Cu and Si inter-diffusion.

The incorporation of a third element in the electroless plating solution may 
largely change the behavior of both anodic and cathodic reactions and the whole 
process. It is known that pure tungsten cannot be deposited either electrochemically or 
chemically, but it can be codeposited with an iron group element. The introduction of 
W in the Ni-P films was explained in terms of the so-called induced codeposition of 
refractory metal with iron group metals.48,49 Nevertheless, despite the large number of 
estimations on the kinetics of codeposited W with Ni and P, a conclusive result has 
not been obtained yet. Therefore, a reaction path is to be developed in this chapter, 
which may account for the detailed anodic and cathodic processes involved.  
3.2 Literature review 
3.2.1 Kinetics of the autocatalytic deposition of Ni-P films in ammoniacal 
solutions 
Touhami et al.50 studied the Ni-P deposition and proposed that the oxidation 
process starts from the deprotonation reaction of the hypophosphite anion. It occurs 
only on catalytic surfaces such as nickel. It has been shown that the adsorption of the 
hypophosphite anion and its change into a reactive species occur with good efficiency 
on etched nickel. The enhancement in the incorporation of P in alloys due to the 
 58
Chassaing et al.53 maintain that a multi-step reduction of molybdate leads to an 
intermediary Mo (Ⅳ) oxide, which is further reduced by metal atoms of the 
iron-group metals. Investigations of the mechanism of deposition of Mo with Ni from 
a citrate electrolyte led to a hypothesis based on adsorption and a catalytic reduction 
of molybdate species. According to this model, the reduction of the Ni complex is 
transport-controlled; the species arriving at the surface by diffusion are then followed 
by a two-step consecutive reduction involving the appearance of an adsorbed 
intermediate. Species such as [Ni(Ⅱ)HCit]- catalyzes the reduction of molybdates 
forming an adsorbed reaction intermediate [Ni(Ⅱ)HCitMoO2]ads. This theoretical 
model is based on the fact that the deposition of Mo is possible only in the presence of 
Ni(Ⅱ)ions in solution, while the reduction of the Ni ions follows an independent path. 
According to the proposed model48,49, refractory metal e.g. molybdenum or 
tungsten, in the anionic form of MoO42- or WO42- in an electrochemical deposition 
deposition bath could form an intermediate complex with the main metal and 
complexant. This complex is adsorded on the electrode surface, and the iron group 
acts as a catalyst for the reduction of the refractory metal. This codeposition process 
may go in parallel with the reduction reaction of the iron group metal in the 
electrochemical deposition. Lu and Zangari et al.54 showed that these nickel-based 
alloys prepared by electroless deposition can exhibit good electrocatalytic activity 
toward the hygrogen reaction (HER) in acidic media. By introducing W or Mo into 
Ni-P, the electrocatalytic activity can be significantly improved, to the point that the 
activity of some Ni-Mo-P alloys toward HER is comparable with that of Pt sheets. It 
has also been shown that the structure (crystalline or amorphous), morphology, 
corrosion resistance, and electrocatalytic activity of alloys depend on the plating 
conditions and alloy composition. Increasing P content in the alloys can enhance their 
 60
    However, so far insufficient experimental evidence has been given to decide 
between any of the proposed mechanisms. 
3.3 The objective of this research 
The central goal of our present study is not only to fabricate a Ni-W-P barrier for 
copper interconnects but get a better understanding of the involved reactions and their 
electrochemical behaviors.  
In the present work, we have done a series of experiments to study the 
interactions between the various components of the plating baths. Therefore, the 
objective of this study is to explore more deeply the kinetics from baths containing 
nickel sulfate, sodium tungstate, sodium hypophosphite, and sodium pypophosphate. 
The effect of bath temperature, pH and [Na2WO4] on the electroless plating of Ni-W-P 
system will be investigated via CV investigation. Accordingly, UV-Vis measurement 
was run to elucidate the nickel complexes in the above-mentioned electroless plating 
system. XPS analysis for the Ni-W-P system will also be obtained to gain further 
insight into the interactions between the various components of the plating baths.

3.4.1 CV investigation  
All electrochemical operations were carried out using a potentiostat1286. A 250 
ml classical three–electrode cell consisting of the reference, working and counter 
electrode was used. The reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode and the 
working and counter electrodes were 2 cm2 platinum square plates. 
In order to simulate the cathodic or anodic reactions, electrolytes in absence of 
either the reducer or the nickel ion were prepared. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) 
measurements were made in electroless plating baths with various pHs, temperatures, 
and various concentrations of the main electrolyte components. The solution 
composition derived from the ternary Ni-W-P alloy bath contained NiSO4, Na2WO4, 
NaH2PO2, complexing agent Na4P2O7, and pH adjuster/stabilizing agent NH4OH as 
previously shown in Table 2.1. 
The working electrode was first cathodically scanned from 0 V to -1.1 V and 
then anodically polarized in the electroless deposition solutions to 0.3 V and back to 
the starting potential. The sweep rate was 10 mv/s. 
3.4.2 UV-Vis measurement  
    UV-Vis was used to investigate the presence and relative concentrations of 
different complex species in the solutions employed. The aim of this investigation was 
to search for species that could be potential reactants participating in the alloy 
deposition mechanism. 
3.4.3 XPS analysis 
    The thin film was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( ESCA for 
chemical analysis) with a PHI model 1600 system equipped with an Omni Focus Lens 
Ⅲ using a standard Al Kα X-ray source( at a high voltage of 15 kV).       
 64
Figure 3.2(5) shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained for the Ni-W-P deposition 
system. The plot is similar to that obtained for the Ni-P system. Just as observed in the 
induced electrodeposition of W or Mo by transition metals,12 no separate peaks are 
present when tungsten is codeposited. The Ni-W system is usually called an induced 
system because tungsten cannot be deposited separately, but the discharge of tungsten 
can be induced simultaneously with the reduction of nickel ions.58The mechanism for 
this process is still debated, but strong evidence to the hypothesis of an intermediate 
Ni-tungsten mixed complex has been recently provided.59  
 3.5.1.1 [Na2WO4] effect 
    Figure 3.3 shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained for Ni-W-P deposition 
system with various [Na2WO4]. With increasing [Na2WO4] in the plating solution, the 
intensities of peak b and d also increase and peak b shifted to more negative potential, 
indicating that the addition of [Na2WO4] into Ni-P solution can accelerate both the 
anodic and cathodic reactions. This is in agreement with the earlier conclusion that the 
deposition rate of Ni-W-P increase with increasing [Na2WO4]. 
3.5.1.2 pH effect 
Figure 3.4 shows the cyclic voltammograms obtained for Ni-W-P deposition 
system with various pH values. The results are similar to Ni-P system. The intensity 
of peak b and peak c increases with increasing pH value. In other words, raising pH 
value promotes the oxidation and reduction of hypophosphite. According to literature 
data60, hypophosphite is known to be a strong reducing agent. The hypophosphite is 
oxidized during deposition, in which OH- are consumed according to equation (3.1), 
and the phosphorus content comes from the reduction of hypophosphite. In addition, 
the oxidation of hypophosphite leading to several hydrolyzed compounds as 
demonstrated in equation(3.2).56 The reaction rates of reaction (3.1) and (3.2) depend 
on the solution pH. Therefore, increasing pH value can promote reaction of (3.1) and 
 66
both pyrophosphate and ammonia is larger than the pyrophosphate-complexes alone. 
Beltowska-Lehman et al.61 once found an increase in the intensity of the absorbance 
and explained it by the mutual interaction between individual complexes of the two 
kinds, leading to the formation of a new complex species. Figure 3.7 also shows the 
spectrum of Ni/W solution. The presence of tungstate has less effect on the position 
and height of the peaks, characteristic of Ni-complexes in the presence of 
pyrophosphate and ammonia at the same pH. The absorbances in the UV spectra are 
approximately the same. This indicates that the concentrations of the 
ammonia-pyrophosphate complex of Ni are independent of the presence of 
tungstate-pyrophosphate complex. Therefore, UV investigations give no evidence of 
the formation of some complex containing Ni and W together. Figure 3.8 presents 
spectra of Ni/pyrophosphate at different pH. An increase in pH leads to a shift of the 
peak towards lower wavelength. This indicates that more water molecules are being 
replaced by ammonia molecules as the ligands. 
 
3.5.3 XPS analysis 
It is well known that pure tungsten cannot be deposited either electrochemically 
or chemically, but it can be codeposited with an iron group metals. Tungsten 
codeposition through the so-called induced codeposition was first proposed by 
Bernner.12 The XPS spectra demonstrated in Figure 3.9 indicates that the films contain 
tungsten in a form of pure tungsten as well as tungstate. This result supports the 
codeposition of tungsten with nickel during electroless Ni-W-P plating. It should be 
emphasized that, in electrodeposited Ni-W, tungsten may be present in the oxide film, 
this being the predominant form in some cases. However, in electrodeposited 
amorphous Ni-W-P films of higher tungsten content (20%-40 wt%), it exists in 
 68

Chapter4. Conclusions 
1. Ni-W-P based barrier has been successfully formed via electroless deposition atop 
Si wafer. In this process, the microstructure, crystal structure, resistivity and the 
composition of Ni-W-P film can be controlled by the variation of [Na2WO4], bath 
temperature and pH value. The elemental composition of the deposited Ni-W-P films 
in this report has been determined to be Ni: 83–87 at.%, P:3-16 at.%, W:1-10 at.%. 
The resistivity of our Ni-W-P film can be as low as 63-92 μΩ-cm. Thus, copper 
could be directly deposited on this barrier layer and the copper seed layer is 
eliminated.  
2. The Ni-P film without the addition of Na2WO4 has an amorphous structure due to 
high P content. However, the Ni-W-P films are always nanocrystalline at as-deposited 
state. Increasing [Na2WO4] enhances the co-deposition of W and inherently 
suppresses the reduction of P, whereby a nanocrystalline structure is formed.
