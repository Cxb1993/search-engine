 Abstract 
A memoryless or Markov source is usually encoded by a variable-length code (VLC), a 
variable-length error-correcting code (VLECC), a reversible variable-length code (RVLC), or a 
arithmetic code. The encoded data can also be further protected by a channel code to enhance 
error-resistance. Recent researches in VLC-based joint source-channel decoding schemes can be 
classified into three categories.  
The first is to use the source statistics for acting as one source and channel decoder at the 
source-decoding stage. Based on a modified form of Viterbi algorithm, usually symbol-level 
trellis structure for maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding on VLECCs is adopted. In order to 
reduce the decoding complexity, low-complexity but sub-optimal tree based sequential decoding 
algorithms were proposed in the literature.  
The second decoding scheme was performed at the channel-decoding stage if a channel code 
is involved. Also based on a generalized Viterbi algorithm, Murad and Fuja presented an exact 
MAP estimation by a bit-level super-trellis which is capable of exploiting all possible sources 
information. The state of each node in the trellis can be represented as one four-dimensional 
vector. However, this scheme has a serious drawback that, for long source sequences, the 
decoding complexity becomes quite expensive due to the enormous number of trellis states.  
Rather than constructing a single decoding unit as those in the first/second decoding 
schemes, in the third category, the overall decoding performance was further improved by 
iteratively using the turbo principle between the source decoders and the channel decoders; 
however, the decoding complexity of such approach becomes much higher. .  
Recently, we have presented a trellis-based MAP soft-decision priority-first decoding 
algorithm (MAPPDA) for VLECCs, along with its approximations, which have a distinguishing 
feature that the computational complexity of the new derived branch metric is very simple when 
compared with the Fano metric. The proposed methods belong to the first category. Based on this 
result, in this project, we will extend it to the cases with more knowledge of the source 
information or side information, and even to the second and third concatenated source-channel 
coding systems for VLCs, VLECCs, and arithmetic code.

二、研究方法與結果 
 
A. 序列串接變動長度碼及迴旋碼其疊代型整合式訊源/通道循序解碼演算法 
在渦輪碼發展史上，疊代式解碼器(iterative decoder)為其核心所在，它能提供逼近
Shannon 理論之解碼效能。在疊代式解碼器中，一般常使用軟式輸出(soft output)BCJR 演算
法來獲得最佳的錯誤更正效能，但其計算複雜度會隨著格狀(trellis)圖上的節點個數增加而
呈指數成長，軟式輸出堆疊(stack)演算法(簡稱 S-SA)可降低此解碼器之計算複雜度。本計
畫以 MAPSDA (Maximum A Posteriori soft-decision Sequential Decoding Algorithm) [請參閱
與本計畫相關研究成果 3]為基礎，提出另一種軟式輸出循序解碼演算法(簡稱 S-MAPSDA)
並探討其疊代式解碼效能。模擬結果顯示，相較於 S-SA，S-MAPSDA 不僅在解碼效能上有
所提升且其計算複雜度亦顯著地降低需多，如圖七及圖八所示。 
由圖七可看出本實驗的三種演算法隨著疊代次數增加，其訊源符號錯誤率逐漸下降，
說明了在此所採用之疊代解碼演算法中，其解碼端的 SISO 解碼模組間互相交換的資訊有助
於改善解碼效能。

A. 參加 Tutorial 
 
Distributed Video Coding: Theory, Practice, and New Promises 
Speaker: Wenjun Zeng, University of Missouri 
Date & Time: Monday, July 19, 09:00 - 12:00 
Venue: Room 310  
Abstract 
Distributed video coding (DVC) is a new coding paradigm that shifts the burden of exploiting the 
video source redundancy to the decoder and provides better error resilience. It is suitable for 
many emerging applications where constraints on battery power, processing capability, and/or 
bandwidth for moving data around (for centralized coding) are significant concerns. Example 
scenarios include wireless sensor networking, "uplink" wireless video communication, extremely 
high rate and high dynamic range imaging and compression, multi-view 3D video acquisition and 
compression, etc..  
Despite the promising information theoretic results of distributed source coding (DSC), the 
performance of practical DVC systems has been shown to exhibit a significant gap from that of 
conventional video coding system such as H.264. As a result, it seems the excitement and 
enthusiasm about the great promise of DSC/DVC have started to fade and abundant confusion 
surfaces in recent years. What is the fate of DVC?  
The primary purpose of this tutorial is to provide the participants with a comprehensive and 
balanced coverage of the theoretical foundation and architectures of DVC, discuss the significant 
challenges that have prevented most existing DVC schemes from performing anywhere 
comparable to conventional video coding, present and advocate a framework that explores the 
important concept of decoder-progressive-learning in DVC, and address both theoretical analysis 
and practical design of progressive-learning-based DVC schemes. With the progressive approach, 
the decoder can learn from the already decoded partial source data to refine the estimation of the 
side information and the source correlation models, which in turn would significantly improve the 
coding performance of the remaining majority of the source data. The lectures will also 
demonstrate progressive-learning-based DVC's promising applications in a number of 
applications, including efficient low-complexity video encoding, efficient compression of 
encrypted images/videos, power-efficient video communications in wireless sensor networks, and 
efficient distributed multi-view video coding. Trends, new promises and future direction will be 
discussed.

Q. Xu, V. Stankovic, and Z. Xiong, “Distributed Joint Source-Channel Coding of Video 
Using Raptor Codes,” IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 
851-861, May 2007. 
 
Abstract—Extending recent works, on distributed source coding, this paper considers 
distributed source-channel coding and targets at the important application of scalable 
video transmission over wireless networks. The idea is to use a single channel code 
for both video compression (via Slepian-Wolf coding) and packet loss protection. 
First, we provide a theoretical code design framework for distributed joint 
source-channel coding over erasure channels and then apply it to the targeted video 
application. The resulting video coder is based on a cross-layer design where video 
compression and protection are performed jointly. We choose Raptor codes – the 
best approximation to a digital fountain – and address in detail both encoder and 
decoder designs. Using the received packets together with a correlated video 
available at the decoder as side information, we devise a new iterative soft-decision 
decoder for joint Raptor decoding. Simulation results show that, compared to one 
separate design using Slepian-Wolf compression plus erasure protection and another 
based on FGS coding plus erasure protection,  the proposed joint design provides 
better video quality at the same number of transmitted packets. Our work represents 
the first in capitalizing the latest in distributed source coding and near-capacity 
channel coding for robust video transmission over erasure channels. 
 
Like in classic source-channel coding, although separation theorems have been shown to hold 
asymptotically (e.g., with infinite code length, delay and complexity), this paper show that 
distributed joint source-channel coding outperforms separate source-channel coding in 
practice. 
 
心得： 
 The seemingly source coding problem of Slepian-Wolf coding is actually a 
channel coding problem.
