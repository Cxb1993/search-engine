    CaZrO3-based with a perovskite structure has attracted much attention of 
materials scientist because of its excellent dielectric and microwave properties1,2). The 
applications include MLCC, microwave resonator, filter, solid electrolyte, hydrogen 
sensors, and thermistors. Moreover, the oxygen, mixed oxygen-protonic, and protonic 
conductivities have been reported. Especially, CaZrO3-based ceramics show the 
protonic conductivity in H2 or water-containing atmospheres3). CaZrO3 (CZ) 
possesses a dielectric constant of about 32 and therefore is widely used as 
negative-positive zero (NPO) multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC). In order to 
reduce the cost of MLCC the cheaper metal such as nickel, copper is used to be as 
inner electrodes and the sintering under a reducing atmosphere is necessary to prevent 
them from oxidization4). However, under such reducing conditions the dielectric 
perovskite material CaZrO3 forms large numbers of ionized oxygen vacancies Vo2+. 
At the ionoization of Vo2+ a high number of electrons are formed which give rise to a 
high electric conductivity. The electrons have to be therefore trapped by acceptor 
dopes. As far as the number of oxygen vacancies are below that of the acceptors, the 
BME material remain in a highly insulating state5). Dopants such as divalent (MnO), 
trivalent (Mn2O3), tetravalent( SiO2), and pentavalent oxides (Nb2O5) are commonly 
adopted to improve the electrical properties of CaZrO3 -based MLCC. 
The aim of this investigation is to present the influence of these dopants on the 
stoichiometry, phase formation, microstructure and electrical properties of calcium 
zirconate. Another objective to clarify what kind of roles these dopants play in 
CaZrO3 will be emphasized.  
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
   The main composition of CaO and ZrO2 powders with one to one proportion   
and various dopants including MnO, SiO2 and Nb2O5 were weighed, and dispersed in 
 - 4 - 
second phase of CaZr4O9 is formed for the CaZrO3 sample with MnO and Nb2O5. It is 
worth noting that the amount of the second phase increases with increasing the 
amount of dopes such as MnO and Nb2O5. To confirm the formation of the second 
phase by X-ray diffraction pattern, three kinds of sample were examined by using 
SEM. Figs. 4 and 5 show the fractured SEM micrographs of CZ doped with various 
dopants. Dense microstructures can be obtained in all cases. The images show the 
only single phase can be easily seen in the case of CaZrO3 with SiO2 addition while 
dual phases with different grain size are often seen in the case of CaZrO3 with MnO 
or CaZrO3 with Nb2O5 addition. The grain size as big as 3-4 mm is CaZrO3 phase and 
the grain size as fine as 1-2mm is a zirconium-rich phase indicating it is a CaZr4O9 
phase. Various dopants added into CaZrO3 affect the number of formation of phase 
that is associated with the stoichiometry of calcium zirconate. According to the phase 
diagram of CaO-ZrO26)shown in Fig. 6, A stoichiometric calcium zirconate is a 
CaZrO3 single phase calcium, on the other hand, a non-stoichiometric calcium 
zirconate meaning zirconate with small excess of ZrO2 is in the presence of dual 
phases including CaZrO3 and CaZr4O9.  
Based on the results, it is suggested that the addition of MnO or Nb2O5 dopant were 
incorporated into the zirconium-site of calcium zirconate resulting in the formation of 
non-stoichiometric calcium zirconate, on the contrary, in the case of the addition of 
SiO2 dopant, a stoichometric calcium zirconat was still kept indicating that SiO2 
dopes did not incorporate into calcium zirconate.  
 
3-2. Measurement of dielectric properties  
The effect of individual dopant on phase, density of CZ powder has been presented 
in previous section. Some of the dopants such as MnO , Nb2O5 may result in the 
formation of second phase (CaZr4O9; CZ4) while addition of SiO2 remain the original

log ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )21 log1log eqeqe -+=eff        
The fraction of volume of CaZr4O9 are increased 15%, 19% and 23% respectively 
with increasing MnO or Nb2O5 content from 1mol%, 2 mol% to 3 mol%. The 
calculated fraction of volume of the second phase is confirmed from the examination 
of SEM on the samples of CaZrO3 with 1mol% MnO addition as shown in Fig.4.   
   Fig. 9 shows the variation of tand in term of the content of dopants. Evidently, 
there are tand level tand. CaZrO3 specimens with Nb2O5 addition show the much high 
tand level and tand increases strongly with Nb2O5 content. In contrast, CaZrO3 
specimens with SiO2 or MnO addition show the low tand  and a decrease in tand  with 
SiO2 or MnO addition is observed. Similarly, Fig. 10 exhibits the IR variation of CZ 
as a function of SiO2 , Nb2O5 and MnO. The results also show that there are two I.R. 
levels. One is that the IR values of CZ is very high and increase with both SiO2 and 
MnO, however, another is that the IR values of CZ is very low and decrease strongly 
with increasing Nb2O5. The effect of dopants on tand and insulation resistance may 
result from the number of phase, the density and the concentration of mobile charged 
carriers. The individual electrical properties of CaZrO3 and CaZr4O9 are shown in 
Table (I), Evidently, though the dielectric constant between CaZrO3 and CaZr4O9 are 
big different, tand and the insulation resistance between CaZrO3 and CaZr4O9 are not 
significantly different. Therefore, the effect of dopes on tand and the insulation 
resistance between CaZrO3 and CaZr4O9 should be mainly resulted from the 
difference of the density and the concentration of mobile charged carriers.   
The improved I.R. and tand  for CaZrO3 specimens with SiO2 content is 
associated with the density increment since SiO2 play a sintering aid role in this study. 
When compared with pure CZ, 7 to 8% gain in density is obtained as CZ is doped 
together with SiO2.

As can be seen from Eqs. (4) Nb+5 ions incorporated into Zr-site of CaZrO3 is a 
donor, the more negatively charged species such as 'e  will be introduced and may 
significantly enhance the concentration of conduction electrons leading to a poor 
performance of IR and tand. The surface colors of the sintered samples support the 
above results, when Nb was doped to the CaZrO3, the color changed from white to 
blue. This blue color shows the energy absorption edge, which seems to correspond to 
the plasma oscillation of conduction electron10). In contrast, when Mn was doped to 
CaZrO3, the color changed from white to brown. This seems to correspond to the 
suppression of electron excitation to the conduction band. 
4. Conclusion 
The effect of individual dopant on the microstructure and electrical properties for 
CaZrO3 sintered under reducing atmosphere were investigated. Main conclusions are 
presented as follows   
1. SiO2 dopant plays a role of sintering aid to enhance densification of 
CaZrO3 without change in the stoichometry. The better electrical 
properties are obtained with increasing SiO2 content due to the 
improvement of densification      
2. Both MnO and Nb2O5 dopant are incorporate into Zr-site with a change 
in stoichometry ( Zr excess ) leading to the formation of second phase 
(CaZr4O9 ), which has a lower dielectric constant (13) in comparison 
with CaZrO3 (32). Thus, dielectric constant of CaZrO3 is greatly 
decreased with increasing MnO or Nb2O5 content.  
3. MnO dopant incorporated into Zr-site of CaZrO3 plays a acceptor role 
which compensates the number of conduction electron contributing to the
