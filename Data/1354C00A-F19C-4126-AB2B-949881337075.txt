Gupta and Vrat (1986) were first to develop an inventory model for stock-dependent 
consumption rate. Later, Baker and Urban (1988) also investigated an EOQ model in 
which demand rate of an item is a power-form function of instantaneous inventory 
level. Mandal and Phaujdar (1989) then presented an EPQ model for deteriorating 
items with constant production rate and linearly stock-dependent demand. Other 
researches related to this area such as Pal et al. (1993), Padmanabhan and Vrat (1995), 
Giri et al. (1996), Ray and Chaudhuri (1997), Datta et al. (1998), Mandal and Maiti 
(2000), Dye and Ouyang (2005), Urban (2005) and so on. 
One of the major assumptions used in previous models was that the 
replenishment cycle would end with zero stock. Urban (1992) first relaxed the 
terminal condition of zero ending inventory and suggested that it was more profitable 
to utilize higher inventory levels resulting in greater demand. Mandal and Maiti (1999) 
formulated an inventory model with stock-dependent consumption rate for 
damageable items and some units in hand at the end of the replenishment cycle. 
Recently, Teng et al. (2005) extended Urban’s (1992) model to allow for not only 
deteriorating but also non-zero ending inventory and proposed an algorithm to obtain 
the optimal replenishment cycle time and ordering quantity. 
3. Assumptions and Notations 
The following assumptions are used throughout this study: 
(1) Replenishment rate is infinite and the lead time is zero. 
(2) The demand rate  at time  is )(tD t )()( tItD βα += , where α , β  are 
positive constants and  is the inventory level at time . )(tI t
(3) We set a maximum inventory level  to reflect the fact that the retailer has 
limited shelf space. The replenishment size raises the inventory at the beginning 
of each scheduling period up to the inventory level .

solution have been shown. Further, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the 
theoretical results, and some observations are obtained from sensitivity analysis with 
respect to major parameters.  
In the future study, it is hoped to further incorporate the proposed model into 
several situations, such as stochastic demand and a finite rate of replenishment. 
Furthermore, it may also take another hired warehouse into account when determining 
the optimal replenishment policy. 
6. Self-Evaluation 
This research corresponds to the original plan and has attained its aim. Hence, 
the study is of great academic value and suitable for publication in academic journals. 
This research is now being submitted to International Journal of Production 
Economics.
