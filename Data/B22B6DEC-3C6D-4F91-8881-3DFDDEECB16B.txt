The process of treadmill test was divided into 
three stages with each one for 5 minutes at different 
rates of 0 km/hr, 2 km/hr and 6 km/hr
(Fig. 4-5). In the whole course of treadmill 
subjects were asked to control their respiratory rate 
at 10/min.

ABSTRACT 
In the neurosurgical intensive care unit, the neuro-
logical patient, who is in critical condition, gener-
ally loses some physiological functions caused by 
brain impairment. This will lead to an intracranial 
pressure increment, insufficient cerebral perfusion 
pressure, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, etc. and most 
seriously, to secondary brain injury by hypoxia, and 
increased mortality. Therefore, the first seven days 
are a very critical period for postoperative patients 
of neurological surgery. The purpose of this project 
was to evaluate cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) 
and autonomic nervous system (ANS) related to 
different severity of neurological patients using 
technique of Pearson’s Moving Linear Correlation 
Coefficient, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) 
and Multi-Scale Entropy (MSE). Cerebrovascular 
autoregulation (CA): The pressure reactivity index 
(PRx) was used to evaluate CA. This index is based 
on the correlation between continuous intracranial 
pressure and arterial blood pressure. Autonomic 
nervous system (ANS): analytic algorithms were 
applied in heart rate variability analysis (HRV). We 
used detrended fluctuation analysis and multi-scale 
entropy to observe fractal dimension and complex-
ity. We anticipated several findings from this study: 
(1)The change of CA and ANS in neurosurgical 
intensive care unit patients during the clinical 
course. (2) The compromise of CA and ANS related 
to the severity of injury. (3) The change of CA and 
ANS related to therapies. (4) Establish an off-line 
biofeedback system. 
 
 
 
 
國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告
日期： 100 年 12 月 12 日
一、參加會議經過
於民國100 年4 月22–24 前往新加坡，參與2011 新加坡、澳洲、紐西蘭重症醫學會聯合論壇。
會議內容涵括許多近年重要重症議題，包括神經重症、重症監測、血液透析、呼吸重症、生命末期照
護及加護病房品管指標等。並於會中發表海報論文“Brain Death Assessment Showing Loss of Intrawave 
Frequency Modulation in Heart Beat Oscilation”。
二、與會心得
此為西太平洋的重症醫學學術研討會，內容精彩、豐富。大會中有邀請自世界各地的頂尖學者演
講，對增進國際視野，學習新知大有助益。此次開會所學，將會應用在臨床重症照護上，期能提升患
者的照護品質。會中，本人發表「腦死患者生理訊號分析」結果，說明腦死患者經心跳變異度分析顯
示其波內頻率調控喪失，這在統計上有其顯著意義，並建議可以此徵象作為腦死判定之一參考依據。
論文的發表得到在場與會學者的肯定與迴響。
三、建議
經由心跳變異度的分析進一步探究腦死患者的生理病理變化，這是結合創傷醫學、神經重症
及醫學工程分析三大領域的一個新的研究方向。期勉之後能繼續相關的重症患者生理訊號分析研
究，從有別於傳統西方醫學的角度切入，深入探究這些訊號背後所隱藏著的訊息，以瞭解各系統
間微妙且複雜的運作，並以此作為重症患者的監測方法之一，提升照護品質。
