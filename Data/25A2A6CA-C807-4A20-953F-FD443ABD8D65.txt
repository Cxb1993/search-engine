Calculation of Temperature Field 
 
In this study we assume that the absorbed 
power density in tissue is equal to the heating power 
density. Here we consider a single blood vessel 
inside and throughout the blood perfused tumor 
tissue in a three-dimensional axis-symmetric 
geometric configuration in the heating model of 
Horng et al. [1].  The energy transport equations of 
tissue and blood are represented in Eqs. (6) and (7), 
respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
 Figure 1 shows that the effects of thermal 
relaxation time (τ = 8s) on accumulated thermal 
dose contours EM43=240 min at t = 200s for 
different three heating schemes and different sizes of 
blood vessels. The thermal lesion was totally cover 
the heated region while using the power density 50 
W/cm3 and heating time 2s, as shown in Figs. 
1(a)-1(e).  On the other hand, the energy dissipation 
from high temperature to low temperature was slow 
due to the finite speed of heat conduction. However, 
for the slow heating the thermal lesion region was 
too small to spread over the targeted treatment 
region in Figs. 1(k)-(o). In addition, the pulsatile 
blood flow affected the downstream thermal lesion 
region in the large blood vessel, as shown in Figs. 1 
(c)-1(e) for rapid heating schemes.   
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The effect of thermal relaxation time becomes 
smaller for a slow heating process. The coupled 
bioheat equation of pulsatile blood flow and thermal 
relaxation time would provide an adequate approach 
for describing the thermal distributions when 
considering heart beating nature and rapid heating 
modality.
