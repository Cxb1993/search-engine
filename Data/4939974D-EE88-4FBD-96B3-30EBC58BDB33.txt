ABSTRACT: In this article, design of a microstrip ring-like diplexer
for Bluetooth and ultrawide band application is presented. Two ring-like
bandpass ﬁlters, operated at 2.4 and 4 GHz, are combined together to
form the proposed microstrip diplexer. Several transmission zeros lo-
cated at the passband edges are introduced to improve the passband
selectivity. High isolation between the two passband greater than 28 dB
is achieved in this study. The designed diplexer is investigated numeri-
cally and experimentally. Measured results show a good agreement with
the simulated analysis. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt

1. INTRODUCTION
For multiservice functions in modern wireless communication
systems, compact-size and low loss diplexers are widely adopted
[1–3]. In past few years, Bluetooth wireless communication tech-
nology for wireless local area network centered at 2.4 GHz is very
popular because of its advantages such as low power, low cost, and
maturity technology [4]. In addition, the ultrawide band (UWB)
system operating at the frequency range from 3.1 to 4.9 GHz
becomes a new and attractive standard technology [5, 6], since it
possess high speed data transmission and very low power con-
sumption. Under this trend, the integration of Bluetooth and UWB
systems will be a valuable research topic. Therefore, to design a
diplexer to satisfy the Bluetooth/UWB application is also attrac-
tive.
In this article, a novel microstrip diplexer used for the
Bluetooth and UWB system is proposed. The proposed microstrip
diplexer is formed from two ring-like bandpass ﬁlters (BPFs). The
ﬁrst ring-like BPF is operated at 2.4 GHz with fractional band-
width of 4% and the second ring-like BPF is operated at 4 GHz
with fractional bandwidth of 40%. To improve the isolation be-
tween the two passbands, the load effect of the ﬁrst BPF on the
passband of the second BPF is considered. Since the two designed
passbands are very close to each other, the isolation should be
carefully considered. Several transmission zeros located at the
passband edges are introduced to improve the passband selectivity
and isolation between the two passbands. The designed microstrip
diplexer is investigated numerically and experimentally. The mea-
sured results show a minimum insertion loss of 1.58 and 0.46 dB
for the two passbands operated at 2.4 and 4 GHz, respectively.
And, the isolation between the two channels is greater than 28 dB.
Measured results show a good agreement with the simulated
analysis.
2. ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED DUAL-MODE DIPLEXER
Figure 1 depicts the schematic of the proposed microstrip ring-like
diplexer. The used substrate in this work is 0.787-mm-thick RT/
Duroid 5880 substrate with a dielectric constant of 2.2. And, the
full-wave EM simulator IE3D [7] is used for simulation of the
proposed BPFs in the diplexer. The proposed diplexer is mainly
composed of a Bluetooth bandpass ﬁlter (BL-BPF) and a UWB
bandpass ﬁlter (UWB-BPF) designed for the Bluetooth and UWB
applications, respectively. For the BL-BPF centered at 2.4 GHz, it
is composed of a perturbed ring-like resonator and two end-open
L-shaped microstrip lines for the input and output of the resonator
[8]. It was reported that the harmonic suppression of the BPF may
be realized by choosing a proper length for the L-shaped micros-
trip line. The center frequency of the proposed BPF is determined
by the length of the ring. The passband response for desired
bandwidth is accomplished by the coupling between the two
orthogonal modes within the resonator, as discussed in the previ-
ous work [8]. In addition, the proposed BL-BPF exhibits the
feature of stopband improvement by the end-open line of the I/O
structure without changing its passband [8, 9]. For the UWB-BPF
centered at 4 GHz, the ultrawide bandwidth response is accom-
plished by adjusting the two feed points offset to the center
location of the coupling line and the perturbation element size, as
discussed in a previous work [10, 11]. The bandwidth is increased
with decrease of the distance from the I/O ports to the center point
of the couple line center port. Additionally, the lower transmission
zero location at the passband edge can be shifted to higher fre-
quency and consequently adjust the passband width. Figure 2
shows the simulated frequency responses of the primary combi-
nation of the designed BL-BPF and UWB-BPF without the match-
ing network. Namely, the parameters are shown in Figure 1 and the
L1 0 mm and L2 0 mm. It is clearly observed that the BL-BPF
centered at 2.4 GHz has a fractional bandwidth of 4% and a
harmonic suppression more than 20 dB up to 6.8 GHz. In addition,
the UWB-BPF exhibits a passband width from 2.98 to 5.1 GHz
with the ideal center frequency of 4 GHz. Although the two
passband performances are satisﬁed for the considered communi-
cation, the isolation between the two channels is only 13 dB and is
poor. Therefore, the extra matching load is needed to improve the
diplexer performance. In this study, we consider about the load
effect caused by the BL-BPF since the inﬂuences of the matching
load for the BL-BPF on the transmission response far away from
the main operating passband of the BL-BPF.

diplexer is around 40.5 mm  80 mm. The measured results are
shown in Figure 5(b). As expected, several transmission zeros are
located near the two passband edges to improve the passband
selectivity and isolation. It is clearly observed that the BL-BPF has
a center frequency of 2.4 GHz, a fractional bandwidth of 4%, a low
insertion loss of 1.58 dB over the entire passband, and a wide
stopband rejection greater than 18 dB from 2.58 to 6.87 GHz. A
high selectivity for BL-BPF is achieved by introducing the trans-
mission zeros at 2.31 and 2.69 GHz with attenuation of 31 and 48.8
dB, respectively. It is also observed that the UWB-BPF has a
center frequency of 4 GHz, a fractional bandwidth of 40% (from
3.3 to 4.85 GHz), and a low insertion loss of 0.46 dB over the
entire passband. In addition, the transmission zeros introduced by
the improved matching load structure are clearly observed at 2.88
and 5.18 GHz which exhibit the attenuation of 29 and 27.3 dB for
the UWB-BPF, respectively. Therefore, a high isolation greater
than 28 dB is achieved between the two channels. Comparing to
the simulated results as shown in Figure 4, the measured results
show a good agreement with the simulated analysis.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this article, the design of a microstrip ring-like diplexer for
Bluetooth and UWB applications is presented. The diplexer is
formed by two individual bandpass ﬁlters, based on the harmonic
suppression and wide passband ﬁlter structure operated at 2.4 and
3.1–4.9 GHz, respectively. With the consideration of the matching
load effect for UWB-BPF, the passband selectivity of the UWB-
BPF can be improved by transmission zeros located at the pass-
band edge. Therefore, a high isolation between the two passbands
greater than 28 dB is achieved. The proposed microstrip diplexer
is fabricated. The measured results show a good agreement with
the simulated analysis.

ber of the resulting matrix and the solution accuracy. Some of the advan-

1. INTRODUCTION
Radial Basis Functions (RBF) have received signiﬁcant attention
in the scientiﬁc literature over the past several years. Speciﬁcally,
they have been investigated extensively in the ﬁeld of neural
networks [1]. Presently, RBFs have not been widely used in
computational electromagnetics. They have been shown to have
very good interpolation qualities and this has led to their recent use
in inverse scattering methods in electromagnetics [2–11]. The
authors have used RBFs in conjunction with a radiation boundary
condition [12]. In this letter, radial basis functions are used in a
meshless method using collocation to solve an electrostatics prob-
lem. In the second section, a brief overview of the different types
of RBFs will be presented and some of the properties of the RBFs
will be discussed. This will be followed by Section 3, which will
discuss the method used to solve partial differential equations
(PDE) using RBFs. In Section 4, an example problem will be
considered and results will be discussed. Finally, Section 5 will
conclude the letter with discussions of the advantages and disad-
vantages of the proposed method.
2. OVERVIEW OF RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS
There are several types of RBFs; some of these, along with their
functional representation, are presented in Table 1.
There are two features to note about all of these functions. One
is that each of these functions has radial symmetry about its central
