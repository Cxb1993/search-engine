Introduction 
Batch crystallization is an important unit operation in chemical engineering, especially for the 
production of high-value added products such as pharmaceuticals, fine and specialty 
chemicals, etc. Many researchers have studied the design and optimization of seeded batch 
crystallization processes.1–6 
 It has long been known that in many cases of practical interest, the crystal growth rate 
is at least apparently size-dependent, with larger crystals growing at a faster rate. Many 
researchers have reported size-dependent crystal growth and developed models to describe 
it.7–11 Shiau and Lu12 investigated the effect of growth rate dispersion on the mean crystal size 
and coefficient of variation in batch crystallization. Aamir et al.13 used optimization to 
determine the seed crystal distribution that will lead to a desired product crystal distribution 
when crystal growth rate is size dependent. Other than these contributions, however, there 
have been relatively few reports of the design and optimization of crystallization processes 
when growth rate is size dependent, and little discussion of the effect of size-dependent 
growth rate on process design and optimization. This may be due in part to the fact that the 
population balance model is more difficult to solve in the case where crystal growth rate is 
size-dependent. Qamar et al.14 briefly review different numerical techniques that have been 
used to solve this problem. 
 In this work, we investigate the design and optimization of batch crystallization 
processes when the crystal growth rate is size-dependent. The results show that many features 
of the design problems are similar to the case where crystal growth rate is size-independent: 
The effect of seed properties is very similar, the effect of different supersaturation trajectories 
is similar, and the shape of the optimal supersaturation trajectory is also similar. Finally, we 
show that an approximate, size-independent model for the crystal growth rate can be used for 
 where ρc is the density of the crystals and kv is the volume shape factor defined such that the 
volume of a crystal with length x is kvx3. In general, the crystal growth rate G is a function of 
both crystal size x and supersaturation S(t), as discussed in the following section. The 
nucleation rate may be described by an empirical expression such as: 
 ( ) ( )0 ( )bbB t k S t tμ= 3  (5) 
where µ3(t) is the third moment defined in equation 3. 
Models for size-dependent crystal growth rate 
A common assumption when growth rate is size-dependent is that the growth rate 
expression can be factored into two terms, one which depends only on the supersaturation 
and one which depends only on the crystal size, i.e.: 
 ( ) ( ) ( )1 2,G S x G S G x=  (6) 
Different expressions for the sized-dependency term, G2(x) have been proposed by 
different researchers.17–20 Table 1 lists some of these. 
In this work, the Abegg-Stevens-Larson (ASL)17 model is used: 
 ( ) ( ) 22 0 11G x G x αα= +  (7) 
Dimensionless system  
 In order to develop some preliminary insight into the effect of size dependent growth 
on the optimization of batch crystallization systems, a dimensionless model is investigated 
first. The model is based on the dimensionless model of Ward et al.,4 but is modified to 
include size dependent growth. The reader is referred to Ward et al. for additional details 
about the dimensionless model. 
 Table 2 shows the reference quantities and dimensionless variables in the dimensionless 
model. In the ASL model (equation 7),  is dimensionless. 1α  2α has units of reciprocal 
length, and so a suitable dimensionless group is:

The values of the kinetic parameters are given in Table 3. Because the activation energies of 
nucleation and growth are small, the temperature dependence of the kinetic parameters is also 
cing significant error.

Growth rate and temperature trajectories 
In this work, several supersaturation or temperature trajectories are compared:  
• Optimal trajectory: the trajectory (supersaturation vs. time) that minimizes the 
following subsection. 
 Linear: The saturation concentration is decreased linearly with time. 
• Constant G: the size independent portion of the growth rate g1(S) is maintained 
constant. 
• Mullin-Nyvlt: the saturation concen
trajectory first proposed by Mullin and Nyvlt:

of each seed will decrease because the total amount of solute available for seed growth is 
fixed. 
ssium Alum System 
The effect of seed properties is also investigated for the potassium alum system. Fig. 3 
shows the volume CSD for different seed mass and seed crystal size. Larger seed mass and 
smaller seed size lead to a smaller nucleus-grown crystal mass, which is the same as the 
result obtained from the dimensionless system. 
Effect of trajectories

 properties are fixed and the product CSDs that result from different trajectories are 
compared. There are four trajectories in this work, the constant growth rate, linear 
concentration-time, Mullin-Nyvlt and optimized trajectory.  
Dimensionless System 
Fig. 4 shows the v
nsionless system. The optimal trajectory gives the best result (largest product seed size 
and smallest nucleated mass), and then the constant trajectory, Mullin-Nyvlt, and finally the 
linear trajectory gives the worst result. The same result is seen in Fig. 5, which shows the 
comparisons when growth rate is size-independent, and was also observed previously.4 This 
suggests that the size-dependency of the growth rate

Use of approximate size-independent models for determination of optimal 
trajectories 
The results developed in this work suggest that from the point of view of process 
devel
size-dependency of the crystal growth rate has only a small effect on the outcome. In th
section we i
ctory using a size-independent approximation. If so, this would be advantageous because 
the numerical routine that determines the product crystal size distribution (or product 
moments) must be called repeatedly for the optimization and the ordinary method of 
moments is much less computationally intensive than any known numerical method that can 
account for a size-dependent crystal growth rate. 
As discussed previously, if one simply sets the parameter α1 equal to zero in the ASL 
model, the overall crystal growth rate may be significantly reduced and this can lead to an 
inaccurate result. Instead, the growth rate expression is modified by setting α1 equal to zero 
(G2(x)=1) and multiplied by a constant κ: 
( )( ) ( )( )1? G S t G S tκ=  (15) 
κ is determined so as to keep the average growth rate, which is defined for this purpose as the 
ratio of the final values of μ  and μ of the seed-grown crystals  the same. A constant 
supersaturation trajectory is used to solve for 
1 0 ,
κ. 
A supersaturation trajectory is then determined using the approximate size-independent 
expression for the growth rate:

The size-dependency of the crystal growth rate has only a small effect on the shape of 
the optimal supersaturation trajectory, which means that an optimization of a 
size-independent growth rate model can give a very good result. Simulations based on a real 
kinetic model published in the literature also support these conclusions.
