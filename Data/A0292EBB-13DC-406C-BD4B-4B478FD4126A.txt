Chapter 1  Introduction 
 
The growth of dendrites, as well as the associated microstructure development, during 
solidification is an important research topic in materials science and materials processing. Its 
simulation is also a great challenge due to the complicated morphological development. The 
phase-field model (PFM) has emerged as a powerful computational tool to simulate this physical 
process [1, 2]. The phase-field variablerapidly changes from liquid (-1) to solid (1) for the 
diffusive interface. The thicknessof the diffusive interface plays a crucial role in the phase field 
model, and needs to be small enough for an accurate approximation of the sharp interface. Karma 
and Rappel [2] and Amberg [3] have made a significant progress by proposing the thin-interface 
model, so that  can be relaxed the same order of the scale of microstructure. By using the model 
with rescaling, Chen and Lan [4] efficiently simulated diffusive growth of a three-dimensional 
(3D) dendrite for various supercoolings by using an adaptive finite volume method, and the tip 
velocity agreed well with the classic solution. The effects of forced and natural convections were 
also investigated recently [5, 6]. With the adaptive finite volume method, we could improve the 
computational power to simulate the cases which is near the experimental cases in length scale 
and time scale. But, there are still some issues about the phase field model people do not know 
much about. Like the anisotropic function of interfacial energy, nonlinear kinetic effect, surface 
instability near grain boundary, grain boundary diffusion. We would propose some solutions to 
deal with these problems.   
The anisotropy of the interfacial energy plays a crucial role in the dendritic growth, as well 
as in the equilibrium shape. By taking the equilibrium shape of a crystal as an example, it is a 
result of the minimization of the interfacial energy at a fixed volume. Thus for a known surface 
energy, one can derive the crystal shape geometrically [7], e.g., by using a vector function (n) 
with a minimized energy [8], where n is the surface normal. A simple and general description a 
fourfold symmetric anisotropy function [9] has been used for a material with a cubic crystal 
structure. However, for a material having a highly anisotropic interfacial energy and a tendency to 
form facets, such as silicon, a special attention is needed. The use of the simple fourfold 
symmetric function leads to mis-orientations when the anisotropic strength is greater than 1/15 
due to the concavity in the reciprocal -plot; is the interfacial energy. For a 2D crystal, 
Eggleston et al. [10] has proposed a regularization method to amend this concavity, and the 
crystal shape with corners and edges have been simulated successfully. Their method can be 
easily incorporated in complicated simulations, and has been used in the 2D simulation of silicon 
crystal growth [11-13]. There are also other methods proposed recently [14, 15], and they have 
been used to simulate the equilibrium shapes successfully. However, the model proposed by the 
Eggleston et al. is still the simplest one keeping the same function form for the convex part. But 
the model cannot be applied in the 3-D, we will extend this model to 3-D in our simulation.  
Nonlinear kinetic effects are an interesting phenomenon in crystal growth is that the growth 
modes and thus the morphology depend on undercoolings and material properties [16]. The facet, 
as a result of lateral growth, at low undercoolings and the rough surface, as a result of continuous 
growth, at high undercoolngs are typical examples. This could be explained by the nature of the 
grain boundary diffusion is considered to be 1D. The embedded grain boundary diffusion fits 
nicely to the framework of the existing adaptive phase field model that we have developed for 
years [13-15]. 
 
Chapter 2 Phase field model and governing equation 
 
2.1 phase field model 
The thin-interface model used here is similar to the one proposed by Karma and Rappel [26]. 
The phase field variable  is set to be 1 in the solid, -1 in the melt, and 0 at the interface. The 
phase-field and energy equations for isotropic surface energy can be written as follows.

where (n) is the characteristic time n the normal vector at the interface), W the interface 
thickness,  the coupling constant, and D the thermal diffusivity. With the thin-interface 
approximation [26], the linkages of the physical parameters (d0, , D) with the phase field 
parameters (, W) are as follows:

where 1a =0.8839 and 2a =0.6627. The kinetic coefficient, , is orientation dependent, and so as 
the characteristic time, . Therefore, if  is temperature or velocity dependent, i.e., = (ui or V), 
 will be the same, and this concept was introduced by Debierre et al. [27]. An adaptive 
finite-volume method [28] is used to solve the above equations with proper initial and boundary 
conditions. Before numerical solution, the above equations are converted into dimensionless form, 
and the length scale W and time scale o are used for rescaling. We also choose 10 W [26]. 
The variables with an asterisk superscript are defined to be dimensionless in the following 
discussion unless otherwise stated. 
The numerical simulation has been developed over years. The adaptive finite-volume phase-field, 
which means first dividing the computational space into finite volumes, and next arbitrarily 
refining those volumes, is used[29]. The minimum size used here is ∆x=0.8W0, and the criteria of 
adaptive volume refinement is -0.99<<0.99. Main simulation domain is showed in figure 2.

local orientation of the crystal with respect to the fixed coordinate system, and it lies in the

2.5 Model for grain boundary diffusion 
The system we consider to illustrate our grain boundary diffusion model is shown Fig. 3, 
which is a simple directional solidification of a bi-crystal. For simplicity, we assume that the 
system is stationary, and the melt/solid interface and the grain boundary are fixed. The 
boundary in any orientation can be written as the following:

As will be illustrated shortly, this harmonic weighting turns out to be very important for the 
melt/solid interface because the large difference in the melt and solid diffusivities.  
Another issue in simulation is to identify the grain boundary, i.e., gb= 1, from the phase () 
and orientation () fields. With a known orientation field, the normal vector of a grain boundary 
can be defined by n



following criteria:

 The above diffusion equation (Eq. (14)) can then be solved with the phase and orientation 
field equations simultaneously by an adaptive finite volume method [34-36]. The equation can be 
written in a dimensionless form by using characteristic length (W0) and time (0). For simplicity, 
we have chosen unity characteristic length and time, so that the dimensionless form remains the 
same for discussion unless otherwise stated.

Once the overheat interface temperature occurs, the large solidification rate caused by huge 
thermal gradient at liquid side would make itself disappear. It explain why the misorientation 
morphology can grow in supercooling melt and the overheat interface temperature do not exist at 
figure 5(b).

After we gain the confidence of our numerical algorithms, the final example is a dynamic 
facet growth. To simulate the facet growth, one could consider wither a highly anisotropic 
interfacial energy [10, 27] or kinetics [37, 38]. Again, in this paper, we use a highly anisotropic 
kinetics. The kinetic coefficient is a function of growth velocity (temperature) and orientation. 
The orientation and velocity-dependent kinetic coefficient is described by as follows:,

the simulation is then carried out for solute segregation and morphological instability during 
directional solidification starting from a bi-crystal seed. Indeed, from the experimental 
observation by Schaefer and Glicksman [4], Sharp and Hellawell [5] and Morris and Winegard 
[6], the morphological instability was always initiated from the tri-junction of the grain boundary. 
To show the development of this morphological instability, we carry out two simulations: one 
with pulling velocity is 0.83 VC
*
 and the other 1.1 VC
*
, where VC
*
is the critical velocity calculated 
from the MS theory [1] 
From the case shown in Fig. 8 at 0.83VC
*
, it is observed that the interface deflects toward the 
melt. However, as shown in Fig. 8, because of the pulling velocity is less than the critical one, the 
growth front remains stable. As the pulling velocity is increased to 1.1 VC
*
, as a result of 
morphological instability, as shown in Fig. 9, the curve interface near the groove protrudes into 
the melt forming the humps, while leaving higher solute accumulation behind the humps.  
 
 For the case considering the melt/solid interface, Fig. 10(a) shows the results of the solute 
diffusion with different melt/solid interface thicknesses. As shown, the simulated results are 
essentially not affected by the interface thicknesses. The 45 degree tilted grain boundary is also 
considered for comparison, and the results are almost the same. The comparison of log < C/C0 > 
versus Y
6/5
 for different SL’s is shown in Fig. 10(b), and again they are in good agreement.
