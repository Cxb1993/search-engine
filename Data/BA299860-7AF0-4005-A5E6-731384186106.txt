Full-Range Phase Shifter at 2.45 GHz
Principal Investigator: Jean-Fu Kiang
Abstract— In this paper, a full-range phase shifter at 2.45 GHz
is proposed, which consists of a lumped 3-bit vector-sum phase
shifter and an active all-pass phase shifter.
In the 3-bit vector-sum phase shifter, switched attenuators
are used to provide attenuation difference with reduced circuit
size. The hybrid coupler, Wilkinson dividers, and the 180 ◦ phase
shifter are also designed using lumped inductors and capacitors
for size reduction. To reduce the insertion loss and enhance the
phase resolution of the phase shifter, an active all-pass phase
shifter is cascaded with the 3-bit vector-sum phase shifter.
Measurement results of the 3-bit vector-sum phase shifter show
that the standard deviation of phase shift is 9.6◦, insertion-loss
variation is confined within 4 dB, and the return loss is above 10
dB. The active all-pass phase shifter has gain above 5 dB with
phase shift range up to 61◦.
Index Terms— Phase shifter, vector-sum phase shifter, active
all-pass phase shifter.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the prevalence of wireless communication, the de-
mands on data rate, coverage, and channel capacity have
inspired several technologies such as smart antennas, multi-
input multi-output (MIMO) systems and adaptive antenna
systems (AAS), where the AAS has been incorporated in
the WiMax standards [1]. The phased-array antenna is the
core of these technologies. For wide-range sevices such as
WiMax, beam-forming capibility of the phased-array antenna
is preferred to offer enough gain and focused coverage.
The phase shifter plays a key role in phased-array antenna
systems [2]. To maximize the performance of the phased-array
antenna, a phase shifter with 360◦ phase-shift range, compact
size, high precision, low power consumption and constant
output level is required. Phase shifter is conventionally real-
ized by ferrite-loaded waveguide devices which offer greater
flexibility but are too bulky and hard to fabricate with modern
IC process. In addition, they are also expensive and require
careful calibration [3].
A switched-line phase shifter, as a true-time delay element
which has frequency-independent delay time is suitable for the
applications of phased-array antennas [4]. Cascaded switched-
line phase shifter provides finer resolution than 1-bit switched-
line phase shifter [5]. However, cascading more phase shifters
will take more circuit area and incur higher insertion loss.
A reflective-type phase shifter (RTPS) has low insertion
loss, high phase resolution, high fabrication yield, and con-
sumes no dc power. An RTPS typically consists of a hybrid
coupler and two variable termination loads [6]. By varying
the impedance of the loads, the output phase can be ad-
justed. A miniaturized RTPS which is composed of two 90◦
transmission-line sections has been proposed in [7]. However,
it is hard for RTPS to exhibit full-range phase shifting.
IEEE 802.16 standards addresses frequencies from 2 to
11 GHz, including licensed and license-exempt bands [1].

The dominant bands are licensed bands of 2.3 GHz (WCS),
2.5-2.7 GHz (MMDS), 3.5-3.7 GHz (ETSI), and unlicensed
bands of 2.4 GHz (ISM) and 5.8 GHz (U-NII) [9]. In this
paper, a full-range phase shifter at 2.45 GHz is designed and
implemented by cascading a 3-bit vector-sum phase shifter
and an active all-pass shifter. Since this phase shifter consists
of only lumped elements, the circuit size is more compact
than using transmission-line components and is suitable for
IC process.
II. LUMPED 3-BIT VECTOR-SUM PHASE SHIFTER
Fig. 1 shows the concept of a vector-sum phase shifter [10].
The transfer function T of this phase shifter can be derived as
T = (bc− ad) /2
√
2 + j (ac − bd) /2
√
2 = |T | ej 6 T
where j =
√−1. To achieve 3-bit phase shifting, each of a,
b, c, and d should have only two states as shown in Table I,
where the H state must be higher than the L state by 7.66 dB
in magnitude and be in the same phase. A switched attenuator
is proposed to fulfill this specification.
The switched attenuator has a wide bandwidth limited only
by the parasitics and the bandwidth of the switch. This design
does not require input/output matching circuits which take cir-
cuit area and have relatively narrow bandwidth compared with
the resistor network. The broadband matching characteristics
in this design will avoid the mismatch problem between the
variable-gain amplifier (VGA) and the hybrid coupler. The
switched attenuator has compact size than its VGA counter-
part. More importantly, there is nearly no phase difference
between the two attenuation states over a wide frequency
range, which is difficult to achieve by using VGAs. In addition,
the phase shifter using switched attenuator consumes no dc
power.

can be adjusted without changing the signal level. The phase
shift range can be obtained by substituting the minimum and
the maximum capacitance, respectively, of the varactor into

The dc supply voltage is 3 V to reduce power consumption,
both P1 and P2 are biased at VGS = 0.5 V and VDS = 2 V to
keep enough headroom and lower IDS. The transconductance
gm is 232 mS at this bias point.

R4 and R7 are used to adjust the drain-to-source voltage,
R5, R6, R8 and R9 constitute voltage dividers to set proper
gate voltage. The L1 and C1 are determined by the center
frequency and the required phase shift range. Since smaller
inductor has higher resonant frequency, L1 is chosen to be 1
nH, which is the smallest inductor available in the SMD 0402
series. The C2 is used for dc blocking and input matching
which is important since the 3-bit vector-sum is sensitive to
impedance mismatch. The L2 and L3 are RF chokes. The C3
performs both output matching and dc blocking. The CBLs are
dc blocking capacitors.
The simulated phase shift and gain with C1 varying from 0.8
to 2.2 pF are shown in Fig. 10. The simulated phase-shift range
is 92◦, the gain is 4.2-6.9 dB. The gain changes slightly with
C1 due to parasitics on the pHEMTs. The return loss is above
10 dB, indicating good matching at the input. Fig. 11 shows
the measured phase shift and gain. The measured phase-shift
range is 61◦ with C1 = 0.8-2.2 pF , which is higher than the
minimum required phase shift range, 45◦. The measured gain
and return loss match with the simulation results reasonably
well.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a full-range phase shifter is proposed. By
cascading a lumped 3-bit vector-sum phase shifter and an
active all-pass phase shifter, a phase shifter with 360◦ phase
shift range and compact size is designed. This phase shifter is
suitable for 802.16 applications.

Switchable SAW Filter Bank for WiMAX
Application
Principal Investigator: Jean-Fu Kiang
Abstract— In this paper, a six-channel low-loss switchable SAW
filter bank is designed for the WiMAX system. Both the coupling-
of-modes (COM) approach and equivalent circuit model (ECM)
are applied to design the filter bank on 42 ◦ YX-LiTaO3 substrate
with aluminum (Al) electrodes. Each individual filter is built on
ladder-type SAW resonators. The filter bank has the insertion
loss of less than 2 dB, channel bandwidth of 20 MHz, stopband
rejection of more than 35 dB, and the chip size is 3 × 1.7 mm2 .
Index Terms— Ladder, surface acoustic wave, filter bank,

I. INTRODUCTION
The Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
(WiMAX) was formed in April 2001 to promote conformance
and interoperability of the IEEE 802.16 standard, also known
as the IEEE WirelessMAN [1]. The original IEEE 802.16
standard specifies the WiMAX in the 10-66 GHz range, which
can support data transmission up to 70 Mbps over distances up
to 30 miles. The IEEE 802.16 standard was updated in 2004 to
802.16-2004, adding support in the 2-11 GHz range, of which
most parts are already unlicensed internationally and only very
few still require domestic licenses [2]. Most business interest
will probably be in the 802.16-2004 standard as opposed to
the licensed bands.
The WiMAX specification releaves many of the limitations
of the Wi-Fi standard by providing increased bandwidth and
more robust encryption. It also provides connectivity between
network endpoints with direct line of sight. The details of
performance under non-line of sight (NLOS) circumstances
are still unclear. The IEEE 802.16 allows inter-penetration for
broadband service provision of VoIP, video, and Internet ac-
cess. The WiMAX systems support different signal bandwidths
from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz, and different modulation schemes
like BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM and 64 QAM. Orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be used to transmit
at high data rates.
There is no uniform global licensed or unlicensed spectrum
for the WiMAX. The bands of frequency for the WiMAX sys-
tems are depicted in [3]. The initial WiMAX profiles include
the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS)
band in 2,500-2,690 MHz and 2,700-2,900 MHz, the 3.5 GHz
band in 3,400-3,600 MHz, and the upper U-NII band in 5,725-
5,850 MHz. The future WiMAX profiles include the US WCS
band in 2,305-2,320 MHz and 2,345-2,360 MHz, the ISM
band in 2,400-2,485 MHz, 3,300-3,400 MHz, the low and
mid U-NII bands in 5,150-5,350 MHz, and the World Radio
Conference (WRC) band in 5,470-5,725 MHz. The widest
band available is around 2.5 GHz in the US, and 2.3/2.5 GHz
in the Asia. The most likely bands will be around 3.5 GHz or
5 GHz elsewhere in the world.
Fig. 1. (a) Architecture of WiMAX RF transceiver proposed in [4], and (b)
architecture of highly reconfigurable and IF channel-select receiver front-end
with switchable filter bank.
To exploit the benefits of WiMAX systems, high-
performance RF transceiver is required. Fig.1(a) shows a
conventional architecture of transceiver that contains too many
off-chip high-Q frequency control components, the mixer, and
the oscillator tend to deteriorate the linearity of the transceiver.
Fig.1(b) shows a targeted receiver topology that takes the
advantage of SAW technology to implement a front-end IF
channelizer. When very sharp frequency selectivity is required,
conventional filter such as coaxial resonator filters, cylindrical
waveguide cavity filters, rectangular filters, dielectric resonator
loaded cavity filters, and microstrip filters will become too
bulky. For such applications, the SAW filters exhibit flat
passband characteristic, sharp skirts, free of spurious response,
small size, and low cost, which is difficult to implement with
low-temperature cofired-ceramic (LTCC) or other technologies
[5], [6]. During the last two decades, a new generation of SAW
filters has emerged. Their typical features are low loss, very
small size, and operating up to 10 GHz [7].

in Fig.2(b). Note that resonators S1, S2 and S3 have half the
aperture length of the resonator S, resonators P2 and P3 have
twice the aperture length of the resonator P , and resonators
P1 and P4 have the same aperture length with that of P .
Fig. 3. (a) Implementation of one-port SAW resonator as in Fig.2 and (b)
its equivalent circuit.
A one-port SAW resonator can be represented by an equiv-
alent circuit as shown in Fig.3, where Rm is the motional
resistance, Cm and Lm are the motional capacitance and
inductance, respectively, and C0 is the static capacitance of
the IDT. The resonant frequency ωr and the antiresonant
frequency ωa can be expressed as
ωr =
1√
LmCm
ωa =
1√
LmCmC0/ (Cm +C0)
The parameters Lm and Cm can be determined from C0 =
CL, ωr and ωa, and Rm is equal to G−1 at ω = ωr .
In the IEEE standard 802.16-2004 [2], the CEPT band C
for WiMAX used in the Europe is 5.725-5.875 GHz and the
channel spacing is 20 MHz, which is too narrow to realize in
the RF band directly. Thus, a mixer is needed to downconvert
the RF frequency of 5 GHz band to the IF frequency around
700 MHz. Fig.4 shows the frequency response of the SAW IF
filter bank designed for the WiMAX systems.

WIDEBAND DIELECTRIC RESONATOR MONOPOLE 
ANTENNA 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
1. Field of the Invention 
[0001] The present invention relates to an antenna combining a dielectric resonator 
with a monopole. 
2. The Prior Arts 
[0002] With the advancement of wireless communication technology, portable 
devices have been widely used in various applications, such as industry, science, and 
medicine, and is also getting more diversified. Their major requirements are 
portability and low power. Therefore, how to reduce the size and power consumption 
of the product become important design considerations. For example, if the wireless 
LAN 802.11a in the 5.25 GHz frequency band adopts ordinary microstrip antenna, the 
ohmic loss will be excessive due to high operating frequency. Since the dielectric 
resonator basically has no ohmic loss, it has the advantages of low loss rate, high 
radiation efficiency and high gain, and is extremely suitable to be operated in high 
frequency. However, the dielectric constant of the prior dielectric resonators is 
approximately below 10, and its size is greater than that of the microstrip antenna. 
Thus, the dielectric resonator antenna is often designed using high dielectric constant 
to reduce the size. But increasing the dielectric constant often results in a reduction of 
the operating frequency bandwidth of the antenna, thereby not meeting with the 
bandwidth requirement within the frequency band. Therefore, it is desired to provide a 
novel and improved wideband dielectric resonator monopole antenna that can solve 
the above-mentioned problems. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 1
[0011] Figure 6 is a radiation pattern of the antenna in accordance with the present 
invention in the XY-plane at the frequency of 5.7 GHz. 
[0012] Figure 7 is a radiation pattern of the antenna in accordance with the present 
invention in the XY-plane at the frequency of 6.1 GHz. 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT 
[0013] In the following, the present invention will be described in detail with 
reference to the attached drawings and component numerals, and it can be carried into 
effect by those skilled in the art after reading it. 
[0014] With reference to Figures 1 and 2, an antenna structure 1 in accordance with 
the present invention is used to receive and transmit signals,  which mainly 
comprises a resonator 11 and a feed-in/feed-out component 12. The resonator 11 can 
receive electromagnetic  signals in the space or transmit electromagnetic  signals 
into the space. The feed-in/feed-out component 12 is used to import or export the  
signals received or transmitted by the resonator 11. 
[0015] In the above-mentioned antenna structure in accordance with the present 
invention, the resonator 11 is a column structure. Part of the exterior surface of the 
resonator 11 is coated with a metal layer 11a, which is made of conductive material, 
and a connector 11b is formed at the bottom end of the metal layer 11a, to be 
electrically connected to the feed-in/feed-out component 12. In particular, as Figure 2 
shows, the resonator 11 is a rectangular column with a resonator width a, a resonator 
length b and a resonator height h. The connector 11b is a metal strip connector with a 
connector height hc and a connector width wc. The resonator width a, the resonator 
length b and the resonator height h of a preferred embodiment are 5.7 mm, 3.3 mm 
and 12 mm, respectively. The metal layer 11a is formed on the three adjacent surfaces 
of the column of the resonator 11. The distance from the bottom end of the metal layer 
 3
distance between the open-circuited slot line 122c and the backside of the resonator 
11 is d. The wiring pattern 122 may incur a coupling effect of the electromagnetic 
signals associated with the resonator 11. In particular, as Figure 3 shows, the 
feed-in/feed-out component 12 according to the preferred embodiment is coated or 
printed on a rectangular substrate 121, on which the feed-in/feed-out length,  
feed-in/feed-out width, and  feed-in/feed-out height are 75 mm, 75 mm, and 0.5 mm, 
respectively. The parallel slot spacing w, which is the distance between the parallel 
slot lines 122b, is 0.5 mm. The parallel slot length L is 39 mm. The inner end of each 
parallel slot line 122b turns 90 degrees and extends toward the other parallel slot line 
122b to form the open-circuited slot line 122c. An open-circuited slot opening, which 
is between the two ends of the two open-circuited slot lines 122c, is approximately 
0.25 mm long. In addition, the distance d between the backside of the resonator 11 
and the open-circuited slot line 122c is 0.5 mm. 
[0018] The open-circuited slot width g2 and the open-circuited slot length s of the 
above-mentioned open-circuited slot lines 122c are used to adjust the impedance 
matching. The open-circuited slot length s is chosen slightly shorter than the parallel 
slot spacing w, and the open-circuited slot width g2 is chosen close to the parallel slot 
width g1. 
[0019] Furthermore, the dimensions of the rectangular column of the resonator 11 
and the open-circuited slot length s of the open-circuited slot lines 122c are used to 
adjust the impedance matching and the resonant frequency. When the distance d 
between the open-circuited slot line 122c and the backside of the resonator 11 is about 
one-seventh to one-sixth of the resonator width a of the rectangular column of the 
resonator 11, the antenna structure is optimized.

modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the 
present invention, which is intended to be defined by the appended claims.

九、發明說明：  
【發明所屬之技術領域】 
本發明係一種介電質共振器天線，其特別係在該介電
質所構成的矩形體中，挖去一部分的介電質形成一個矩形
井狀空腔，以增強電場並延伸頻寬。 
 
【先前技術】 
習知的介電質共振器天線通常以高介電係數、低損耗
材料製作。介電質共振器天線具有許多優點，例如輻射效
率高、結構簡單，且可激發不同模態以得到不同的輻射場
型。然而它屬於共振型天線，頻寬有限。基本上，共振型
天線的工作頻率和頻寬由天線尺寸、形狀所決定。嘗試增
加介電質共振器天線的頻寬的辦法有：將圓錐體介電質共
振器的錐角部分截掉，將較小截面接地，再利用探針饋入，
可達約 40%的頻寬。或增加矩形柱介電質共振器天線的長
寬對高度比亦可增加頻寬。或將多塊大小不同、共振頻率
相近的介電質共振器天線疊在一起，使其工作頻帶相連而
達到寬頻效果。或可將介電質共振器天線置於微帶天線上
方，並在微帶天線上挖槽縫，使能量可饋入至介電質共振
器天線，並使兩天線的工作頻帶結合而增加頻寬。或可在
介電質共振器天線上貼上金屬片，產生額外的共振，並使
其頻率與介電質共振器天線相近，藉此延伸原本介電質共
振器天線的頻寬。但是這些方式皆會提高製程複雜度與成
本。因此，本發明基於介電質共振器天線之頻寬限制進行
 5
狀金屬層為導電線路，在該金屬接地層上局部鏤空形成一
鏤空部；該帶狀金屬層與鏤空部形成一饋入饋出元件，其
係配合該介電質共振器，而輸出特定頻帶之訊號至該介電
質共振器進行發射，或輸入該介電質共振器所接收之訊
號；其中，該介電質共振器天線的幾何尺寸係對應所接收
或發射特定頻帶之訊號。 
因此，本發明由介電質所構成的矩形體共振器內嵌入一
矩形井狀空腔，可獲得 34 %的寬頻，且該介質共振天線具有
體積小、構造簡單、容易製作之優點，同時利用微帶線當作訊
號線，透過耦合槽縫饋入天線，易與其他平面電路整合，並可
減少其他元件對天線的干擾。

DIELECTRIC RESONATOR ANTENNA WITH A 
CAVED WELL 
 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
1. Field of the Invention 
[0001] The present invention relates to a dielectric resonator antenna, and 
in particular to a rectangular dielectric resonator, of which part of the dielectric 
is removed to form a rectangular caved well, for enhancing electric field and 
expanding bandwidth. 
 
2. The Prior Arts 
[0002] A conventional dielectric resonator antenna is usually made of a 
material with high dielectric constant and low loss. The dielectric resonator 
antenna has many advantages, for example, high radiation efficiency, simple 
structure, and various radiation patterns achieved by stimulating various 
modes. However, it is a resonator antenna, and its bandwidth is limited. 
Basically, the dimensions and shape of the antenna decide the operating 
frequency and the bandwidth of the resonator antenna. 
[0003] The means to increase the bandwidth of the dielectric resonator 
antenna include: (1) cutting off the apex of a conical dielectric resonator, 
making the smaller cross-section grounded, and using a probe to feed in, 
thereby achieving about 40% of bandwidth; (2) increasing the ratios of length 
to height or width to height of a rectangular parallelepiped dielectric resonator, 
which may also increase the bandwidth; (3) piling a plurality of dielectric 
resonators with various sizes and resonant frequencies close to each other, 
thereby combining the operating bandwidth to increase the bandwidth; (4) 
mounting a dielectric resonator above a  patch antenna, and providing a slot 
on the patch antenna, thereby feeding energy  into the dielectric resonator and 
 1
[0009] Based on the objectives mentioned above, the present invention 
provides a dielectric resonator antenna, which comprises a dielectric resonator. 
The dielectric resonator  is a rectangular parallelepiped resonator made of a 
dielectric, and a cuboid is cut out from the resonator to form a caved well, 
thereby forming a dielectric resonator antenna, which can receive or transmit 
the signals of specific bandwidth. The dielectric resonator is mounted on a 
surface of a dielectric substrate.  The top surface of the dielectric substrate is 
coated with a ground metal layer and the bottom surface of the dielectric 
substrate is coated with a strip metal layer. The dielectric substrate is made of a 
dielectric material, and the ground metal layer and the strip metal layer are 
conductive circuits. Part of the ground metal layer is etched  off to form  a 
slot. The strip metal layer and the etched part form a feed-in/feed-out 
component for the dielectric resonator. The feed-in/feed-out component feeds 
signals of specific bandwidth to the dielectric resonator for transmitting, or 
picks up signals received by the dielectric resonator. The geometric dimensions 
of the dielectric resonator antenna are  related to the received signals or 
transmitted signals of specific frequency and bandwidth. 
[0010] Therefore, according to the present invention, the rectangular 
parallelepiped resonator is made of a dielectric material and provided with a 
rectangular caved well, which may achieve 34% bandwidth. Also the 
dielectric resonator antenna has advantages of small size, simple structure 
and easy to manufacture. In the meantime, using a microstrip as  the signal 
line and using coupled slot to feed in the antenna make the dielectric 
resonator antenna easy to integrate with other planar circuit, and reduce 
interference between the antenna  and  the other components. 
 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS 
[0011] The present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art by 
 3
with a ground metal layer 21 and a strip metal layer 23, respectively. 
[0019] The dielectric substrate 22 of the feed-in/feed-out component 20 is 
made of dielectric materials such as FR4, Teflon, Duriod, fiberglass, aluminum 
oxide, ceramic materials and other dielectric materials. The ground metal layer 
21 is an electric circuit, which is a conductive material printed on the top 
surface of the dielectric substrate 22. The ground metal layer 21 also has an 
etched part 21a, which is a  slot etched from the ground metal layer 21. The 
strip metal layer 23 is an electric circuit, which is a conductive material 
printed on the bottom surface of the dielectric substrate 22. 
[0020] Referring to Figure 3, the dielectric resonator 10 is mounted on the 
upper surface of the ground metal layer 21 of the feed-in/feed-out component 
20. Wherein, a part of the ground metal layer 21  underneath the dielectric 
resonator 10 is defined as a resonator foot-print region 10a, and a part of the 
resonator foot-print region 10a beneath the caved well 11, is defined as a 
caved well foot-print region 11a. Therefore, the etched part 21a is across the 
resonator foot-print region 10a and parallel to the caved well foot-print region 
11a. 
[0021] Furthermore, a part of the bottom surface underneath the etched 
part 21a is defined as an etched part projection region. The strip metal layer 23 
extends from one edge of the dielectric substrate 22 toward the caved well 
foot-print region 11a, and passes through the etched part projection region. 
Wherein, the length, the width, the height of the dielectric resonator 10 are a, 
b and d, respectively; the length and the width of the feed-in/feed-out 
component 20 (or the ground metal layer 21) are Lg and Wg, respectively; the 
width of the strip metal layer 23 is Wm; the length of a part of the strip metal 
layer 23 extending over the etched part 21a is Ls; the length and the width of 
the etched part 21a are La and Wa, respectively; and the length and the width 
of the caved well 11 are s1 and s2, respectively. The strip metal layer 23 and 
the etched part 21a incur a coupling effect of the  electromagnetic signals.

concept of multi-scale aggregate functions and show how they are used as basis 
functions to construct the solution of large array problems. 
Following this, it will discuss the concepts of characteristic basis functions 
(CBFs), both in the context of MoM and FDTD, and show how to derive them 
by solving manageable size problems. It will then move on to illustrate their use 
in solving both the large array as well as associated microwave circuit problems. 
Finally, it will turn to the FDTD and show how the concepts of CBs are 
extended to the time domain to solve large antenna, scattering and EMI/EMC 
problems using the serial-parallel FDTD (SPFDTD) algorithm. 
□ Performance Enhancement of Communication 
Antennas using Metamaterials 
In this course, it will begin by introducing the fundamentals of 
metamaterials for RF and microwave applications, that are artificial dielectrics 
comprised of periodic structures with metal or metallo-dielectric inclusions in a 
background medium. Following this it will discuss the design of superstates for 
performance enhancement of patch-type antennas. Finally, it will move on to the 
topic of metamaterial substrates for bandwidth enhancement of microstrip 
antennas. 
Numerous illustrative design examples will be included in the presentation, 
including those for the size reduction of microstrip antennas using metamaterials, 
with applications to communication, sensors and RFID tags. 
□ The Art and Science of Ultrawideband Antennas 
The imminent wide scale commercial deployment of ultrawideband (UWB) 
systems has led to increased interest in UWB antenna design. The requirements 
imposed by UWB systems place stringent demands on UWB antennas. For 
instance, the spectral and impedance matching properties of a UWB antenna 
Page 15 of 30 
 2006 IEEE AP-S International Symposium USNC/URSI National Radio Science MeetingAMEREM Meeting &
addition, pertinent analysis methods, optimizations and small antenna 
performance limits will be described. 
□ Advances in the Design of Electrically Small 
Antennas 
Optimization of the performance properties of electrically small antennas 
represents a challenging design problem for the antenna engineer. As wireless 
devices decrease in size, there is an increasing demand for physically smaller 
antennas, yet the performance requirements are rarely relaxed. 
This half-day workshop provides a detailed discussion on the theory, 
challenges and performance trade-offs associated with the design of electrically 
small antennas. The workshop begins with an overview of the basic theory and 
concepts associated with electrically small antennas. This segment of the 
presentation provides an understanding of antenna performance limitations in 
terms of impedance, radiation patterns, bandwidth, efficiency, and quality factor. 
Techniques used to design self-resonant electrically small antennas are described 
and compared. These include dielectric loading, linear loading (increasing wire 
length), top-loading, and “folded” configurations. The relationship between the 
antenna’s performance characteristics and its physical properties is discussed. 
Issues such as the significance of antenna geometry are considered. The 
performance of the small antenna on small finite ground plane is considered 
with a particular emphasis on how the antenna’s location on the ground plane 
affects impedance, pattern and polarization properties. The workshop concludes 
with a discussion on recent advances made in the design of low profile, 
conformal and integrated device antennas. 
□ Micro and Nanostructured Transmission-Line 
Metamaterials and Their Applications 
Page 17 of 30 
 2006 IEEE AP-S International Symposium USNC/URSI National Radio Science MeetingAMEREM Meeting &
extensive applications in mobile systems (such as 900/1800 MHz bands), 
wireless local area networks (WLANs, such as 2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz bands), and 
ultra-wideband (UWB, such as 3.1 ~ 10.6 GHz band) communications. Many 
innovative planar antennas for related applications such as internal mobile phone 
antennas, base-station antennas, WLAN mobile-unit (laptop, PDA) and 
access-point antennas, UWB antennas have been reported recently. These recent 
developments in planar antennas for applications in mobile, WLAN and UWB 
communications will be addressed. More than 100 related planar antenna 
designs will be presented in this short course. 
□ Domain Decomposition Methods for Computational 
Electromagnetics 
This short course will introduce students into recent developments in 
domain decomposition methods for solving large electromagnetic problems such 
as large finite antenna arrays, frequency selective surfaces (FSS), metamaterials, 
and antenna arrays on large platforms, etc. With patience in creating the problem 
geometries, it is now possible to solve electromagnetic problems with hundreds 
or even billions of finite element unknowns on simple PCs without compromise 
of the solution accuracy. 
There will be four lectures in this short course: Introduction to domain 
decomposition methods, hybridization of different numerical methods, 
geometric non-conforming domain decomposition method, and a broadband 
antenna array design. 
□ Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) in Engineering 
Electromagnetics: Let Darwin and the Bees Design

Page 19 of 30 
 2006 IEEE AP-S International Symposium USNC/URSI National Radio Science MeetingAMEREM Meeting &
engineering designs, including microstrip antennas, multi-band and wideband 
antennas, synthesis of non-planar radar absorbing materials for RCS applications, 
Luneburg lens antenna design, array antennas, synthesis of reflector and horn 
antennas, design of electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures, etc, and (d) 
assessment of the advantages and the limitations of the techniques. 
□ EBG Surfaces, Artificial Magnetic Conductors and 
Soft-Hard Surfaces 
In recent years, there has been a lot of attention to using periodic structures 
in antenna design. These structures are nowadays referred to as photonic or 
electromagnetic bandgap structures or simply by their acronyms PBG or EBG 
structures. When such structures are used to obtain high-impedance surfaces, 
they are related to the transversely corrugated surface, that 15 years ago was 
generalized into a concept of soft and hard surfaces, based on a terminology 
used in acoustics and diffraction theory. 
The course will relate the present PBG/EBG work to artificial magnetic 
conductors as well as to artificially soft and hard surfaces. The theory of ideal 
magnetic conductors and soft and hard surfaces will be explained in detail, as 
well as how to implement these theoretical models in existing software based on 
numerical methods such as GO, UTD, FDTD, FEM and moment method. It will 
also show how magnetic conductors and soft and hard surfaces can be realized 
artificially in practice, and how to analyze these realizations without having to 
model each detail of the periodic structure. This can be done by using 
unidirectional current grids, asymptotic boundary conditions for strip grids and 
corrugations, homogenized boundary conditions, or impedance boundary 
conditions. The limitations of the different analysis models as well as surface 
realizations will be discussed with particular attention to diffraction effects, 
Page 21 of 30 
 2006 IEEE AP-S International Symposium USNC/URSI National Radio Science MeetingAMEREM Meeting &
method is that the measurements can be performed fast and easily when the 
antenna or phone is located in different talk positions relative to a head phantom 
or other environments. Special emphasis will be directed towards fast and 
accurate measurements of static and dynamic receiver sensitivities, known as 
total isotropic sensitivity (TIS) and average fading sensitivity (AFS), 
respectively. Reverberation chambers for EMC applications are normally very 
large, but for measurements at 900 MHz and above, it is possible to use a small 
chamber that can pass through a 80 cm wide door. The course is based on recent 
published and unpublished materials related to extensive measurements in both 
large and small reverberation chambers. The course includes discussion of 
results measured on actual mobile phones and Bluetooth modules. 
□ Smart Antennas 
The objective of this presentation is to illustrate that an incomplete 
understanding of the Maxwellian physics can often lead to wrong conclusions 
and could promise illusory designs, particularly in the area of wireless 
communications. The presentation starts with the direct data-domain least 
squares approach to adaptive processing without forming a covariance matrix. It 
is at least an order of magnitude faster than the stochastic methods. Examples 
will be presented for performing STAP processing using real measured data on 
an airborne platform called the MCARM data set. Then, how to perform 
adaptive processing using real conformal arrays will be described. Particularly, 
when they are operating in the presence of mutual coupling and other near-field 
scatterers. It will be shown that one can get a perfectly dispersionless channel 
once attention is paid to the physics of the problem which is lacking in the 
present methodologies. Impulse response of antennas in the time domain will 
also be discussed. It will be shown that one needs a new paradigm to look at

nineties and a bevy of recently developed complimentary, innovative 
technologies such as MOEMS (micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems), 
nano-structures and meta-materials (EBG/PBG) could revolutionize traditional 
RF system design and packaging concepts. Today, a marriage of diverse 
materials and nano-technologies promises fast realization of commercially 
viable, high reliability, lightweight, compact, prime power efficient 
microwave/millimeter wave (MW/mmW) photonic hardwares that are capable 
of meeting many demanding applications. 
In this short course, use of photonics in MW/mmW beam forming and 
steering of large multibeam, multichannel phased array antennas will be 
discussed in detail. Presentation will include introduction to the basics of fiber 
optic communication, component technology, and systems architectures to 
demonstrate optical control/manipulation of MW/mmW signals. Also, feasibility 
of optical generation, transmission, block conversion (up/down), and 
distribution of high dynamic range MW/mmW signals in an optical feed network 
will be assessed. Relevant state-of-the-art optical/MOEMS/nano-technologies, 
subsystems, and systems will be presented. 
□ Modeling and Simulation Strategies in 
Electromagnetics: Teaching via Virtual Tools 
This short course provides a tutorial introduction into modeling and 
simulation strategies pertaining to complex electromagnetic problems and 
supplies several user-friendly Matlab-based virtual tools which are believed to 
be very effective in teaching lectures such as EM wave theory, transmission 
lines, antennas, radio-wave Propagation, etc. Modeling and simulation concepts, 
strategies and challenges in electromagnetic engineering will be discussed. 
Topics to be covered include fundamental concepts such as accuracy, precision,

signal processing. A more convenient experimental evaluation is desirable and 
the technique of using the antenna impedance matrix beckons. However, this 
approach requires certain conditions regarding both the propagation 
environment and the antenna elements. If the conditions hold (which can usually 
be arranged), then the designer can efficiently trade off performance against 
compactness of the antenna configuration. This is illustrated through wire and 
patch design examples in which the antenna can be made sufficiently compact to 
force the diversity gain to be significantly reduced. 
□ On the use of Support Vector Machines for Antenna 
Array Processing 
Support vector machines (SVM) are machine learning techniques which 
have been showing superior generalization performance and robustness against 
noise in a large variety of regression and classification problems, compared to 
classical linear methods and neural networks. Also, the SVM formulation 
guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solutions, thus avoiding the 
problems of convergence and local minima of most classical nonlinear 
approaches. For that reason, SVMs have been gaining popularity among the 
scientific community. 
This course adapts the SVM formulation to the communications 
environments, where signals are complex and training data sets are usually much 
smaller than in other applications. It develops SVM methods for regression, with 
emphasis in nonlinear array processing with spatial and temporal reference. 
Practical implementations are provided with detailed explanations of the 
algorithm implementations. That way, attendants will be able to immediately 
experiment and apply the SVM approaches to array processing.

四、心得 
筆者以壁報方式發表論文時，有多位學者給予相關研究上的建議，
並提供其他嘗試方向，使我獲益良多。同時，多位學者對筆者所製作的
碎形天線很感興趣；有別於以往呆板的幾何形狀，筆者的碎形呈現不規
則圖案，且對於天線效能有意想不到的影響；只可惜此次與會有些倉
促，尚未將結論做到盡善盡美。在此感謝多位蒞臨學者的指教。 
在聆聽其他議題時，亦獲得許多新知，尤其是關於利用微波來偵測
有無攜帶危險物品，以及微波影像在醫學上的應用。會場上關於此議題
的報告共有十幾場，從不同角度探討此類議題，令人印象深刻。 
此外，亦有利用電磁脈衝來預測地震的相關研究；報告中說明：地
震發生時，地震波將影響電磁波的傳遞，因此可以藉由觀測電磁場的變
化來預測地震。台灣位處於板塊交界上，地震帶給人民財物與精神上的
損失甚鉅，而該研究提供我們一個新的方向，倘若能將此結論實現，便
能防患於未然，讓全民走出地震的陰霾。 
最後萬分感謝筆者的指導教授江簡富教授，給予筆者此次與會機
