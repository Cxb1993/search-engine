Abstract
In this project, we proposed a method to
fabricate a D-shaped optical fiber of Bragg
surface grating filter component by utilizing
thickness of photoresist and D-shaped fiber
polishing along with photolithography 、
holographic interference lithography
technologies and micro-molding process. By
changing the thickness of photoresist, we
could fabricate a D-shaped fiber of Bragg
surface grating with an adjustable average
refraction index.
In the first year, we will do side-polished
on multi-mode fiber. It will precisely stop
polishing until it reaches the core of fiber.
Next, we will fabricate the diffraction grating
filter component through photolithography
process and holography interference
lithography. It utilizes spinner to spin coating,
and then the positive photoresist on core of
fiber with short periodic Bragg surface
grating will be fabricated by
photolithography and holographic
interference lithography technologies. The
diffraction grating filter component will be
deposited by gold with thermal evaporation
coating process. These components will be
observed and analyzed for its optical reactive
features.
In the second year, we will fabricate the
diffraction grating filter component through
holography interference lithography and
micro-molding process. The diffraction
4to the fiber core. The first step was to remove
the cladding above the core to improve the
mode overlap. This cladding removal was
accomplished by polishing the fiber. Figure 1
shows the fixed procedure of the D-shaped
fiber on the glass (the dimension of glass are
3 cm x 1.5 cm x 0.1 cm. First, we formed the
protruding structure of polymer OG146 on
the glass (Fig.1(a)-(c)). The fiber was put on
another glass substrate with the flat surface
of the fiber facing down (Fig1(d)), and the
protruding platform (Fig1(c)) was put on the
top of the fiber. The OG146 was injected into
the tunnel (Fig1(e)).The epoxy in the tunnel
was cured by exposing the UV light for 1-2
minutes. After separating the OG146 with
transparency, we obtained the polishing
sample (Fig1(f)).The polished sample was
then put on the grinding machine with
abrasive paper (3M-4000, the particle size is
about 3 μm) for 48 seconds, and then with 
water and AI203 powder (6:1, the AI203
particle size is about 0.3μm) for 30 seconds. 
Once a short polish that removes the cladding
above the core is performed, the core was
near the surface of the fiber.
In order to increase the light in the core to
interact with the grating on the flat surface,
we first deposited a thin layer (2-3μm) 
OG146 on the flat surface of the fiber, which
was mounted on a slide glass.
We have used three methods to fabricate
polymer gratings on D-shaped fibers.
(1) First method
The fiber was spun-coated with a layer of
0.6μm thick Ultra 123 photoresister (Ultra 
123 made by Micro Chem. Corp., Mass.,
refractive index = 1.618). This sample was
first baked in a conventional oven at 90℃ for
120 s to remove excess solvent from the
photoresister. The sample was then placed on
the sample holder for the holographic light
exposure using a two-beam infrarometer
technique. The details of the process were
described in the previous reports [6]. The
profiles of the grating were measured by
atomic force microscope (AFM). Figure 2
showed the AFM and SEM results of the
photoresister , with the grating period of 505
nm and the grating depth of 404 nm.
(2) second method
Rapid prototyping of polymer grating
structures on a D-shaped optical fiber
involving a three-step process was performed
first. A 700-μm thick glass substrate was first 
cut into a 5cm × 1cm rectangle. A positive
photoresist film (Ultra 123 made by
MicroChem Corp., MA., refractive index =
1.618) was deposited on the glass. A grating
pattern is holographically exposed using a
two-beam interference pattern on a positive
photoresist film (Fig.3(a)-(b)). The details of
the process involved for the grating
fabrication was described in our previous
reports [7]. The patterned resist was used as a
mother mold to transfer the pattern onto a
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin film
using typical micro-molding techniques (e.g.,
stamping) [8-10]. The diluted PDMS was
coated uniformly onto the patterned
photoresist. After baking at 90°C for 1 hr, the
PDMS was cured and was easily peeled off
from the photoresist (Figs. 3(c)-(d)). The
gratings pattern on PDMS was then
transferred onto the UV polymer on the
surface of a D-shaped fiber using a UV
replication process described by Rossi and
our previous reports [7,10] (Fig. 3(e)-(g)).
The PDMS mold was placed on a thin Pyrex
glass for a suppor. A spacer with a thickness
of 400μm was placed between the mold and a 
thin Pyrex glass with the polished D-shaped
fiber. After injection of the precure UV
polymer (OG146), the epoxy was then cured
under a broadband UV light operating in a
wavelength range of 300-400nm. After the
polymer was fully cured, the PDMS mold
was easily peeled off from the UV polymer.
The details of the process were described in
the previous reports [7]. The profiles of the
grating were measured by atomic force
microscope (AFM). Figure 4 showed the
AFM and SEM results of the photoresister,
with the grating period of 504 nm and the
grating depth of 404 nm.
(3) Third method
Rapid prototyping of polymer grating
structures on a D-shaped optical fiber
involving a three-step process was performed
6grating depth of 394 nm.
When we compare the three methods, we
found that the second method can obtain
better grating.
Based on our results, we found that the
grating period and the corresponding depth of
the grating pattern can be accurately
controlled down to an error rate of less than
1% by second method.. We also found that a
high aspect ratio of almost 1:1 between the
depth and period of the grating structure
could be obtained using this process. The
profiles of the grating were measured by
atomic force microscope (AFM).
The spectral characteristics of the optical
filter were measured using an optical
spectrum analyzer (Q8384 Optical Spectrum
Analyzer, Advantest Inc., Japan). The
measurement schematic diagram is depicted
in Figure.7. An amplified spontaneous
emission (ASE) light source with a
wavelength range from 1560 to 1620 nm was
used as the wide band light source. An
alignment He-Ne laser source, as the
auxiliary source, was combined with the
wide band source using a 2×1 optical fiber
coupler. The optical filter was set on a
micro-positioner, and two single mode fibers
were used as the input and output fibers. The
input light source was polarized in the TE
direction as was the mode field measurement
system. The output fiber, then, was connected
to the optical spectrum analyzer to
characterize the filter performance. The
measured result is shown in Fig.8. The Bragg
wavelength of the fiber is measured at
1590nm. Figure 4 showed the transmission
dip of -22dB was obtained, and
3-dB-transmission bandwidth was
approximately 5nm.
四、Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully
created a process to fabricate the grating on
the D-shape fiber. A good aspect ratio on the
grating pattern could be obtained. By
polishing process, the surface of the fiber
could be near the core. It will allow the
overlap between the grating and the field of
the guided modes to increase.

5fluorine-doped cladding, and an undoped super-cladding.
The core is 9μm in diameter and is located 
approximately 15 μm from the flat surface. Even with 
the gratings close to the core, the field overlap with the
guided mode is still minimal. However, because of the
large index modulation between the index of the
cladding and the index of air, reflectivity of nearly 100%
can also be achieved using SR-FBGs created with
D-fiber.
In order to fabricate the gratings very close to the
fiber core. The first step was to remove the cladding
above the core to improve the mode overlap. This
cladding removal was accomplished by polishing the
fiber. Figure 1 shows the fixed procedure of the
D-shaped fiber on the glass (the dimension of glass are 3
cm x 1.5 cm x 0.1 cm. First, we formed the protruding
structure of polymer OG146 on the glass (Fig.1 (a)-(c)).
The fiber was put on another glass substrate with the flat
surface of the fiber facing down (Fig.1(d)), and the
protruding platform (Fig.1(c)) was put on the top of the
fiber. The OG146 was injected into the tunnel (Fig.1
(e)-(f)).The epoxy in the tunnel was cured by exposing
the UV light for 1-2 minutes. After separating the
OG146 with transparency, we obtained the polishing
sample (Fig1 (g)).The polished sample was then put on
the grinding machine with abrasive paper (3M-4000, the
particle size is about 3 μm) for 48 seconds, and then with 
water and AI203 powder (6:1, the AI203 particle size is
about 0.3μm) for 30 seconds. Once a short polish that 
removes the cladding above the core is performed, the
core was near the surface of the fiber.
In order to increase the light in the core to interact
with the grating on the flat surface, we first deposited a
thin layer (2-3μm) OG146 on the flat surface of the fiber, 
which was mounted on a slide glass. The efficiency of
the Bragg reflection is proportional to the index contrast,
therefore, in order to maintain a highly reflective grating
a high refractive index of photoresister is used in here
[7].
The fiber was spun-coated with a layer of 0.6μm 
thick Ultra 123 photoresister (Ultra 123 made by Micro
Chem. Corp., Mass., refractive index = 1.618). This
sample was first baked in a conventional oven at 90℃
for 120 s to remove excess solvent from the
photoresister. The sample was then placed on the sample
holder for the holographic light exposure using a
two-beam infrarometer technique. The details of the
process were described in the previous reports [8]. Based
on our results, we found that the grating period and the
corresponding depth of the grating pattern can be
accurately controlled down to an error rate of less than
1%. We also found that a high aspect ratio of almost 1:1
between the depth and period of the grating structure
could be obtained using this process. The profiles of the
grating were measured by atomic force microscope
(AFM). Figure 2 showed the AFM and SEM results of
the photoresister, with the grating period of 505 nm and
the grating depth of 404 nm. The spectrum
characteristics of the fiber were measured using an
optical spectrum analyzer. The Bragg wavelength of the
fiber is measured at 1590nm. The transmission dip of
-22dB was obtained, and 3-dB-transmission bandwidth
was approximately 5nm.
Figure 3 shows a diagram of the final sensor. The
sensor consists of a SR-FBG that is 2 cm long and ~2
μm of spun on and cured PDMS. The sensor is 
experiment on response to gas VOCs. Response is
recorded for variety gas-phase concentrations of
dichloromethane. Dichloromethane is chosen for the
experiment because of its reported high solubility in
PDMS. The reflection spectrum from the grating is
monitored using a Micron Optics sm125 sensing
interrogator. The experiment set up is shown in Fig. 4
[7]. The two mass flow controllers, one for air only, and
one for an air/VOC mixture varied in flow contribution
to create various mixtures but as a pair maintain a total
flow of 12L/min. The air /VOC mixture is created
through use of a bubbler, where temperature is
monitored to calculate vapor pressure and concentration
levels. Various flow ratios of analyte/air concentration
and air only are flowed into a plastic 3 L test chamber
containing a small mixing fan and the sensor.
Figure 5 shows the Bragg wavelength shift in
picometers (pm) as a function of dichloromethane
concentration in parts per million (ppm). The
response is linear, and it is expected for small
changes in refractive index abo ve the SR-FBG. The
slope of the line is 2.38 x 10-4 pm/ppm.
III. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully created a
process to fabricate the grating on the D-shape fiber. A
good aspect ratio on the grating pattern could be
obtained. By polishing process, the surface of the fiber
could be near the core. It allow the overlap between the
grating and the field of the guided modes to increase. A
fiber-optic chemical sensor based on a surface relief
fiber Bragg grating (SR-FBG) on a D-shaped optical
fiber (D-fiber) was also fabricated. A PDMS layer is
spun on top of the surface relief grating to absorb the
analyze chemical. The refractive index of the PDMS
changes as the chemical of interest is absorbed into this
layer and the Bragg wavelength shifts. A linear
