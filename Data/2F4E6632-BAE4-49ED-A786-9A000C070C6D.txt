Abstract 
In this project, one investigates the 
dynamic behavior of an atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) inclined microcantilever 
measuring a biomaterial’s topography in viscous 
fluid. The dynamic behavior depends on the 
interacting atomic tip-sample force and the 
hydrodynamic effect including squeezing force 
and additional mass added to the 
microcantilever. In AFM applications, the 
microcantilever is usually inclined at an angle to 
the surface being imaged. Choosing an optimal 
microcantilever inclination for liquid AFM 
increasing the quality factor and the wet natural 
frequency is significant. However, the 
inclination of the cantilever to the surface leads 
to a non-uniform distributed force along the 
cantilever. In addition, the interacting atomic 
tip-sample force is nonlinear. Therefore, the 
mathematical model is very hard to solve and 
usually solved approximately in the neglect of 
some effects. However, a better and complete 
understanding of the physics in dynamic force 
microscopy is generally required to further 
improve the performance of atomic force 
microscopes. The analytical solution of this 
mathematical model will be derived here. 
Moreover, the effects of the inclined angle, the 
hydrodynamic loading and the interacting 
atomic force on the frequency shift and the 
quality factor of AFM are studied. Finally, the 
errors of measuring a sample’s topography due 
to hydrodynamic loading and the inclination are 
investigated. 
 
Keywords: AFM; inclined topography; fluid; 
measuring principle 
1. Introduction  
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) subjected 
to a damping force has been widely developed 
as a powerful technique for obtaining 
atomic-scale images and the surface properties 
of the soft materials, such as polymers and 
biological samples1,2. In general, a biological 
sample is measured in liquids. So far, some 
microcantilever. This results in wet natural 
frequencies that are much lesser than the dry 
natural frequencies. These effects are 
investigated here. The cross-section of beam is 
considered to be non-uniform. The beam 
material is homogenous.

where mt the tip mass, W the flexural 
displacement, x the coordinate along the beam, 
L the length of beam, and L0 the characteristic 
length. A small value of L0 is introduced to 
avoid the numerical transaction error. E is the 
Young’s modulus of beam. A and I denote the 
cross sectional area and the area moment of 
inertia, respectively.  is the mass density per 
unit volume.  is the oscillating frequency. 
The damping coefficient ctotal includes the 
cantilever material damping c0 and the 
squeezing damping coefficient cv. The 
squeezing damping is due to the hydrodynamic 
force. If the cantilever approaches the surface 
the water must be squeezed out, and the 
viscous resistance causes a hydrodynamic 
force, breaking the movement of the cantilever. 
Therefore, there exists the corresponding 
viscous damping with the cantilever. Because 
the mechanism of fluid-structure interaction of 
a cantilever in liquid is very sophisticate9, any 
accurate semi-analytical model is quite 
helpful.  
The viscous damping coefficient is 
v sc c c  ,                   (3) 
where cs is squeezing damping coefficient. c  
is the viscous friction damping of the 
cantilever in free fluid. In addition, the total

where m0 is the mass of cantilever per unit

canilever. Two recent semi-analytical models 
by Rankl et al.10 and Naik et al.8 are discussed 
by Lin16. Lin found that these semi-analytical 
models are inaccurate for the cases of an AFM 
cantilever close to a sample’s surface. 
   Therefore, based on the results by Bassak 
and and Raman9 and using the inverse method, 
one derives the effective squeezing damping 
coefficient cv

In general, the closed-form fundamental 
solutions of two coupled differential equations 
with variable coefficients are not available. 
However, if the coefficients of the equations, 
which involve the material properties and/or 
geometric parameters, can be expressed in 
matrix polynomial form, then a power series 
representation of the fundamental solutions can 
be constructed by the modified method of 
Frobenius16.

variable x. It means that when the tip is at the 
top dead position, i.e., the velocity of the tip is 
zero; the velocity at the other position of beam 
is not zero. According to the fact, the total

properties, the measurment error with a large tip 
amplitude is smaller than that with a small tip 
amplitude. The decreasing the beam length 
increases the Q-factor and the resonant 
frequency. It is well known that increasing the 
Q-factor will decrease the disturbance of noise. 
Therefore, the measurement error of a short 
cantilever is smaller that that of a long 
cantilever.

Introduction  
Due to economic and save material, thin-walled beam is widely 
used in many industrial fields such as structure elements and 
aircraft constructions. Because the cross section of thin-walled 
beam is very complicated, most of researches of the vibration 
problems of the thin-walled beam had been studied the single or 
twin symmetry cross section. There are very few researches had 
studied the asymmetry thin-walled beam with arbitray pretwist. 
    Timoshenko and Gere [1] and Vlasov [2] investigated the 
theory of the vibration of the thin-walled beams. Timoshenko [3] 
considered the effect of warping of an I-beam. Gere [4] studied 
the free torsional vibration of an I-beam. Gere and Lin [5] and 
Lin [6] and Aggarwal and Cranch [7] studied the coupled 
bending-torsion vibration of beams of thin-walled open cross 
section. Yu [8] derived the variational equation of coupled 
bending-torsion motion together with the associated 
stress-displacement relations. Dubigeon and Kim [9]and Leissa 
[10] studied the vibration of cylindrically curved panels based 
upon shell theory. Irie, Yamada and Tanaka [11] studied the free 
vibration of a thin-walled beam-shell of arc cross section is 
studied by using shell theory and beam theory. 
    Since the 1970s several attempts have been made to apply 
the finite element method to static and dynamic analysis of 
thin-walled beams, such as Gunnlaugsson and Pedersen [12], 
Kawai [13], Senjanovic and Grubisic [14]. Traditionally, 
flexural behavior has been modeled on the basis of classical 
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for undeformable cross sections, 
resulting in the so-called C1-continuous ‘thin-beam’ elements, 
such as the literatures by Barsoum and Gallagher [15], Meek 
and Swannel [16], Pittaluga [17]. However, more recent 
developments emphasized the use of shear-flexible modeling 
approaches; i.e., C0-type elements, such as the literatures by 
Bathe [18], Cook [19], Noor and Peters [20], Stolarski and 
Belytschko [21]. Filipich and Rosales [22] dealt with the 
coupled bending-torsion free vibration of a uniform spinning 
beam with one axis of symmetry. 
For a nonrotating pretwisted beam with doubly symmetric 
cross section, approximation methods are very useful tools to 
investigate the coupled bending-bending free vibrations of 
pretwisted beams where it is difficult to obtain exact solutions 
even for the simplest cases. These methods are the finite 
element method [23], the Rayleigh-Ritz method [24], the 
Reissner method [25], the Galerkin method [26], and the 
transfer matrix method [27, 28]. Lin [28] derived the exact field 
transfer matrix of a nonuniform nonrotating doubly symmetry 
beam with arbitrary pretwist and studied the performance of a 
beam with elastic boundary conditions. 
   For a rotating pretwisted beam with doubly symmetric cross 
section, Rao and Carnegie [29] used the Holzer-Myklestad 
approach to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes 
of a cantilever pretwisted blade. Subrahmanyam and Kaza [30] 
studied the vibrations of a cantilever tapered pretwisted beam by 
using the Ritz method and the finite difference method. 
Subrahmanyam, Kulkarni and Rao [31] used the Reissner 
method to study the vibration of a rotating pretwisted cantilever 
Timoshenko beam. Sisto and Chang [32] proposed a finite 
element method for a vibration analysis of rotating pretwisted 
beam. Young and Lin [33] studied the stability of a cantilever 
tapered pretwisted beam with varying speed by using the 
Galerkin method. Kar and Neogy [34] used the Ritz method to 
study the stability of a rotating pretwisted cantilever beam. 
Hernried [35] used the finite difference method to determine the 
natural frequencies of a rotating pretwisted nonuniform cantilever 
beam. Moreover, the author used the mode-superposition method 
to determine the forced vibration of the beam. Surace, Anghel 
and Mares [36] derived the approximate method based on the use 
of structural influence function to determine the natural 
frequencies of a rotating cantilever pretwisted Bernoulli-Euler 
beam. Lin [37] studied the instability and coupled 
bending-bending vibration of a rotating pretwisted beam with 
doubly symmetric cross section. As a result, no analytical 
solution has been given to the coupled bending - bending - 
torsion vibrations of a nonuniform and asymmetry beam with 
arbitrary pretwist and an elastically restrained root.  
In this paper, the governing differential equations and 
boundary conditions for the bending-bending-torsion vibration 
of a nonuniform and asymmetry beam with arbitrary pretwist 
and an elastically restrained root are derived by using 
Hamilton’s principle. An efficient algorithm for determining 
the semi-analytical transition matrix of the system is derived. 
The proposed method, which is the generalization of the 
method given by Lin [37], be used to study the vibration of a 
beam with arbitrary asymmtric cross-section and pretwist. 
Finally, the effects of several parameters on the frequencies of 
an asymmetry pretwisted thin-walled beam are investigated. 
Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions 
    Consider the dynamic response of a fixed-fixed nonuniform 
Rayleigh beam with asymmetry cross section as shown in Fig. 1. 
The displacement fields of the beam are [23]:

Application of Hamilton’s principle yields three coupled 
governing differential equations and twelve elastic boundary 
conditions. 
Without considering the axial neutral displacement u0, and the 
Coriolis force effect, the coupled dimensionless governing 
differential equations of the system are written as
