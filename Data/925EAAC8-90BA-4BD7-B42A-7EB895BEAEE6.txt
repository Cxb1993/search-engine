Abstract 
Due to the rapid progression for wireless 
technology, the cellular networks are also 
evolved from the first generation to the third 
generation and even beyond the third 
generation further. The subscriber services 
are gradually changed from voice to 
multimedia since higher speed of 
transmission will be provided by newer 
cellular technologies. Consequently, the 
multimedia services are getting to become 
the major trend in next-generation cellular 
networks, and the Call admission control 
(CAC) will play the key role for guaranteeing 
the quality of service (QoS) in wireless 
cellular networks, owing to the scarce 
wireless spectrum. Because the user mobility 
is so indeterminate, the goal which keeps 
both call dropping probability (CDP) and call 
blocking probability (CBP) below a lower 
level simultaneously is more difficult and 
seldom literatures focused on such issue. 
Thus, the appropriate prediction information 
will be useful for a CAC scheme to meet 
QoS issues of both CDP and CBP at the same 
time. 
There have been so many studies 
focusing on the prediction of user mobility, 
and they are fallen into two considerations: 
and higher system utilization issues at the 
same time. Although prioritized channel 
assignment schemes for accommodating 
handoff attempts and optimization studies for 
assigning channels to priority classed have 
been proposed in the reference study [11, 12], 
the user mobility has been considered a 
crucial factor for affecting traffic 
performance in the cellular networks. 
The emergency problem on demand of 
extensive bandwidth for multimedia services 
and the increase of mobile velocity is 
appropriate bandwidth allocation to 
guarantee QoS and progress the resource 
utilization obviously. Thus, if the prediction 
of user mobility is applied suitably for 
channel (code) allocation in mobile cellular 
networks, the resource utilization will be 
improved obviously. A proper bandwidth 
reservation scheme that could reserve the 
required bandwidth for the mobile in the 
predicted cell should be proposed to solve the 
QoS issue for a mobile cellular system. 
Therefore, the HMM [13] based prediction 
for user mobility is applied to the call 
admission control policy which reserves the 
suitable bandwidths in the appropriate cells 
during the call duration and the profile 
concept of cell approaches [14] is also 
combined to solve such a problem in this 
paper. The proposed scheme models the 
prediction of user mobility as an HMM 
problem, and the decoding method of the 
HMM can find out the sequence states which 
are represented as the visited cell numbers 
for a mobile during the call duration. The 
prediction result can be as the bandwidth 
reservation targets, which cells should 
reserve for a call to handoff to, while a call 
duration time. And the proposed will be the 
best prediction result since the HMM decode 
is to find out the sequence sates which can 
satisfy the maximum probability under a 
given HMM observation sequences. 
According to the study [16], final 
information is a prediction of users’ number 
in a given cell, and it leads to use a global 
approach that only observes variations of 
system utilization and users’ flows. There are 
many advantages for [16]: it does not require 
any control message and additional load for 
the MSC; cells generate their own statistics 
independently from others; it is sensitive to 
geographical constrains and to users’ 
common habits. 
Therefore, based on the concept of cell 
approach, an agent that is consisted of a 
prediction module and a CAC algorithm for a 
given cell is proposed in this paper. The 
proposed agent can do its own prediction and 
CAC works for each cell to avoid extreme 
computations focused on the MSC, and the 
global statistics can be gathered via the fixed 
high-speed link in a periodic time. 
 
II. Preliminary and Related Works 
The HMM can be used in various fields, 
for example, the discovery for DNA atlas is 
one of the famous applications. In order to 
understand the power of HMM and their 
application further, the basis of HMM will be 
introduced, and the application method 
which is used in the proposed method will be 
also mentioned in this section 
simultaneously. 
A. The Definitions of HMM 
Consider a test which is a observation of 
the outcome for tossing three coins in some 
sequence inside a room that is closed and 
what you can see is only the outcomes of the 
tossing result TTFFTFF…this is called the 
observation sequence. You don’t know both 
the sequence in which the different coins are 
tossed and the bias of the various coins. A 
given condition which assumes the third coin 
(state) is highly biased to produce heads and 
all coins are tossed with equal probability, 
and if we expect that the tossing test produce 
greater number of heads than tails in the 
output sequence. Besides the previous 
condition, another condition is given to 
suppose the bias probability of going to the 
third coin (state) from either the first or the 
second coin (state) is zero; then if we were in 
the first or second state to begin with the 
heads and tails will appear with almost equal 
probability in spite of the bias. Obviously, the 
output sequence depends very much on the 
individual bias, the transition probability

Both statistical and artificial approaches are 
usually applied for most of the time series 
prediction techniques. One of the typical 
statistic models that based on statistical 
concepts and principles is Box-Jenkins 
forecasting model [17]. Although a wide 
spectrum of time series behavior can be 
modeled by such models, they can not model 
well when there are noises in the time series 
such as inaccurate or incomplete data. In the 
research [18], neural networks that are one of 
the well-known artificial intelligent 
techniques have been claimed to be able to 
achieve better prediction compared to 
statistical models. Whatever, the study [19] 
shows that there exit some drawbacks for 
neural networks, such as hard to pre-select the 
system architecture, spending much training 
time, and lacking knowledge representation 
facilities. Besides, the study [20] applies the 
data mining concept to perform time series 
prediction. Both adaptive association rule and 
pattern matching techniques are employed by 
[20] to mine for repetitive patterns, which can 
be used to understand the underlying 
utilization of system utilization, in the time 
series. Although this model can perform life 
long adaptation and reinforcement learning 
for continuous prediction, the disadvantage is 
the requirement for intensive computation 
power and huge storage. 
 
From the definitions of previous subsection 
and Eq. (1), Vl(i+1) can be formulated as Eq. 
(2), deducted into Eq. (3), and Eq. (4), 
respectively. 
 
Vl(i+1) = max{π1,…,i}P[ x1…xi, π1, …, πi, 
xi+1, πi+1 = l ]  
Vl(i+1) = maxk P(xi+1, πi+1 = l | πi = k) 
max{π1,…, i-1} P[x1…xi-1, π1,…,πi-1, xi,πi=k] (3
Vl(i+1) = el(xi+1) maxk akl Vk(i) (4
 
Finally, the Viterbi algorithm is applied for 
resolving the problem, and the resolving 
method can be summarized as the following 
four steps [12]: 
 
Step 1: Initialization 
 V0(0) = 1   (0 is the imaginary 
first position) 
 Vk(0) = 0, for all k > 0 
Step 2: Recursion 
Vj(i)   = ej(xi) × maxk akj Vk(i-1) 
 Ptrj(i)  = argmaxk akj Vk(i-1) 
Step 3: Termination 
P(x, π*) = maxk Vk(N) 
Step 4: Trackback 
 πN* = argmaxk Vk(N) 
  πi-1*  = Ptrπi (i) 
 
Summary, the Viterbi algorithm is an 
inductive algorithm in which at each instant 
you keep the best possible state sequence for 
each of the N states as the intermediate state 
for the desired observation sequence x= 
x1x2…xN. Finally, we will select the best path 
for each of the N states as the last state for the 
desired observation sequence. Of course, the 
selected one will have the highest probability. 
A suitable prediction mechanism can help 
the CAC scheme to do better decision for call 
admission, thus the integration of CAC and 
prediction will effectively reduce the CDP to 
meet the QoS requirement. 
C. Time series prediction 
D. CAC overviews 
In general, handoff calls are assigned higher 
priority over new calls, thus there have been 
many studies that gave preferential treatment 
to handoff call [21] focused on QoS guarantee. 
Many different admission control strategies 
have been discussed in the literatures to 
provide priorities to handoff requests, without 
significantly sacrificing new connection 
requests. These strategies fall into two 
categories: Handoff Queue(HQ) [22], and 
Guard Channel(GC) [23] schemes. 
One of the calls in the handoff queue is 
served by HQ based methods when there are 
available resources. The basis of GC policy is 
to preserve certain of resources in each cell 
for handoff call admissions. The system 
reserves backup channels referred to as 
“guard channels” for providing preferential 
treatment to handoff calls to keep the 
continuous connectivity for mobiles. The GC 
policies can be also classified into two

the prediction of user mobility clearly, the 
following steps are the summary of HMM 
resolving for the prediction of use mobility.

Step 3:     set BW_R=1; /* class 1 traffic,

process rate λ; Apply the four steps of the Viterbi 
algorithm for

of user mobility;

call*/ Get the transition states sequence

   else 
The transition sates sequence are the 
mobility perditions which the mobile will 
handoff to during call life. After describing 
the resolution of user mobility prediction with 
HMM, the proposed scheme, HMMCAC 
(HMM-based Call Admission Control), is 
illustrated as follows.

 Fig.4: The illustration of agent concept 
Due to the individual characterization of 
time series for each cell, the concept of agent 
which executes the prediction, and call 
admission control tasks for a given cell is 
proposed for simplifying the implementations. 
Fig.4 shows that an agent is built for each base 
station which can communicate and exchange 
the necessary information with the Mobile 
Switch Center (MSC) via a fixed high speed 
link. Thus, the MSC can evaluate the 
performance of the whole system in terms of 
CDP, CBP, and system utilization according 
to the individual information. 
A. The concepts of prediction method for 
cell-based approach 
The process flow of the proposed prediction 
model, shown as Fig.5, is consisted of four 
sub-modules. The proposed model is a part of 
an agent which is built in each cell and is 
executed for supplying prediction information 
for the CAC algorithm. The time series data is 
stored in the storage of each cell and 
exchanged via the MSC, if need. The 
proposed model can also perform other 
resource predictions in the same way. 
1. Sub-module for analysis of time series 
data 
The analysis sub-module is response for 
performing data pre-processing and data 
mining on time series data. The purpose of 
data pre-processing is to convert the time 
series data into gradient code which is defined 
by the application characteristics of prediction. 
The data mining is to generate chain code 
pattern, and the learning results are stored into 
database which will be used for prediction 
task. The time series data is represented in a 
chain code format to keep track of the 
rate-of-change of time series. The 
rate-of-change of a time series is obtained by 
calculating the difference between each two 
temporal point. The gradient code is defined 
by using the difference to divide a pre-defined 
base which can be decided by the prediction 
sensitivity and system storage. In order to 
restore the prediction code, the reminder of 
division is recorded as a compensation value. 
The purpose of transferring the difference into 
gradient code is to make the exact difference 
of two temporal points to be a fuzzy value. 
The process flow of generating the gradient 
codes is illustrated in Fig.6 with pre-defined 
base 10. 
The following phase of the analysis 
sub-module performs data mining to detect 
the periodicity of patterns and other relative 
information. The process of data mining is 
based on Eq. (6) to find iterative pattern.

The set function decides whether a 
repetitive pattern exists or not. If there exists a 
repetitive pattern of length n that is 
represented as the size of the pattern window, 
the n differences between each gradient 
vectors must be all zero with distance d, 
where d is the delay (d >= n) and i is the time 
of the first point in the preceding pattern. 
Pattern with different distances between the 
pattern length and the delay are managed in 
different list. The occurrence times of 
periodic patterns and the average of 
compensation values will be recorded in the 
database. 
 
 10
 Fig. 8:An example of updating the pattern list 
The prediction selection sub-module 
dynamically adopts one of the prediction 
results that are from both compensation 
prediction and time series prediction. For 
compensation prediction sub-module, the 
compensation algorithm generates several 
results with various coefficients α, and the 
best prediction result will be chosen 
according to the average distance. 
B. The proposed CAC scheme for cell-based 
approach 
The proposed CAC scheme, named time 
series prediction Call Admission Control 
(TSPCAC), adopts the result of time series 
prediction to be one of the criteria for 
admitting a new call request. The other 
criterion is the situation of bandwidth 
consumption for the six adjacent cells, 
because it will be concerned with the 
successful handoff probability for the 
admitted new call request. Besides, the 
concept of maintaining CDP below a 
predefined threshold, which can be decided 
by user demand, is also combined with the 
proposed CAC, and the details of the 
proposed CAC scheme are illustrated in the 
following algorithm. 
Algorithm TSPCAC (Time Series Prediction 
Call Admission Control) 
begin 
declare 
 time(): system execution time; 
 Te: simulation end time; 
 BW_L: left bandwidth in current time; 
 BW_LN: left bandwidth in the next time; 
throttle_flag: alert indictor for new call 
admission from 
 adjacent cells; 
call_flag: indicator for call request  
/*judge new call or handoff*/ 
 thresholgCDP: the predefined threshold 
for CDP; 
 Traffic_c: traffic class; 
while(time()< Te) 
  begin 
calculate the left bandwidth BW_L 
according to current system utilization; 
if (call_flag == handoff) /*call request 
is handoff call*/ 
begin 
if ((Traffic_c == 2) && (BW_L >= 
4) )  
      admit and allocate four units of 
bandwidth for 
 the handoff call request; 
else if ((Traffic_c ==1) && (BW_L 
>= 1) 
       admit and allocate one unit of 
bandwidth for 
 the handoff call request; 
       else 
         reject handoff call request; 
end 
else  /*call request is new call*/ 
begin 
      call the prediction module for 
obtaining system 
 utilization and handoff  dropping 
probability in  
 the next time; 
      calculate the potential left 
bandwidths BL_N in the next time 
according to the prediction result; 
if ((Traffic_c == 2) && (BW_L <= 
4) ) 
  begin 
      set the throttle_flags of the six 
adjacent cells  
to 1; 
        reject new call request; 
      end 
else if ((Traffic_c ==1) && (BW_L 
<= 1)  
       begin 
         set the throttle_flags of the 
six adjacent  
cells to 1; 
 12
The input parameters for case 1 are 10 
minutes for the mean of call duration time μ, 
and 5 minutes for the mean of channel holding 
time γ. The simulation results, shown in 
Fig.9(a), exhibit that the CDP of the proposed 
CAC is lowest among comparison targets, 
except the guard channel policy with 4 units 
of bandwidths preserved. In opposite, the 
guard channel policy with 4 units of 
bandwidths preserved has the highest CBP, 
shown in Fig.9(b), and the proposed method 
has only a little higher than unpredicted one in 
CBP comparison. Furthermore, both the 
proposed method and unpredicted one can 
achieve higher utilization when the traffic 
load is heavy, showed in Fig.9(c), but both the 
guard channel policies can only achieve lower 
utilization when the traffic load is heavy. 
Especially, the guard channel policy with 4 
units of bandwidths preserved has the worst 
performance in CDP and system utilization, 
due to more bandwidths preserved 
permanently. However, the proposed method 
can keep both CDP and CBP lower level 
simultaneously, and higher system utilization 
is also able to be achieved in heavy traffic 
load.

In order to analyze the impact of channel 
holding time on the system utilization for the 
proposed method, three channel holding times, 
1, 3, and 6 minutes are adopted for evaluation, 
and the mean of call duration time is 10 
minutes. Fig.10 illustrates longer channel 
holding time will have better performance. 
The reason is that longer channel holding time 
has smaller transition times which will cause 
higher frequencies of handoff and it will also 
reserve smaller time of bandwidths in 
advance. However, the phenomenon is 
inherent no matter what kind of the methods is 
applied, and it is only a little of impact for our 
proposed method.

 Fig. 13: The simulation result for system 
utilization of random case 
 
In order to demonstrate the performance for 
the proposed CAC scheme, the first case is 
adopted for performance evaluation. The 
simulations are also executed under a given 
cell that has its history in system utilization 
and CDP, and other assumptions are 
described as follows: 
z There are 20 bandwidth units for a given 
cell. 
z The traffic arrival follows Poisson 
process with rate 1. 
z The service time follows exponential 
time distribution and the mean time is 6 
time units. 
z The occurrence possibilities of handoff 
call and new call are 0.5, and 0.5 
respectively. 
z The predefined CDP threshold 
thresholdCDP is 0.3. 
The comparisons of performance evaluation 
are among the unpredicted scheme that admits 
call request immediately if there are enough 
bandwidths left, the proposed CAC scheme, 
the guard channel policy that preserves one 
bandwidth unit beforehand, and the guard 
policy that preserves four bandwidth units in 
advance. 
Fig.14 illustrates that the guard channel 
policy with 4 bandwidth units preserved 
maintains the lowest CDP. On the contrary, 
Fig.15 shows that the guard channel policy 
with 4 bandwidth units preserved has the 
highest CBP. However, the proposed CAC 
scheme has maintained the CDP below the 
predefined thresholdCDP since the correct 
prediction results is provided at time 00:09, 
and the corresponding CBP is almost the same 
as the unpredicted scheme and guard channel 
policy with one bandwidth unit preserved. 
Although the guard channel policy with one 
bandwidth unit preserved sometimes can 
maintain the CDP below the predefined 
thresholdCDP, the CDPs become higher than 
thresholdCDP when the system utilization is 
under heavy load such as time 00:13 and 
00:17. 
In the light of the simulation results that are 
shown from Fig.9 to Fig.10, the proposed 
CAC can not only satisfy the predefined QoS 
requirement which maintains the CDP below 
a predefined threshold but also keeps the CBP 
as low as possible even though the system 
utilization is in high load. Therefore, no 
matter what the system utilization is, the 
proposed CAC scheme can perform well.

prediction result is provided to the proposed
