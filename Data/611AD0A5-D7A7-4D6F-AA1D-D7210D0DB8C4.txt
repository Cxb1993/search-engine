I. INTRODUCTION 
   Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is an essential technology for bandwidth 
broadening in today’s optical communication. It can be realized in photonic integrated circuits 
(PICs) by a variety of techniques, such as co-directional couplers [1], [2], micro-ring resonators 
[3], [4], arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) [5]-[7] and two-mode-interference (TMI) couplers 
[8], [9].  TMI multiplexing is particularly interesting because of its simple configuration and 
easy fabrication. The operation of TMI multiplexing is based on the difference of self-imaging 
periods of the wavelengths λ1 and λ2 propagating in a two-moded waveguide. The coupler length 
Lc of λ1-λ2 demultiplexing can be approximated by  
 
/cL π β= Δ , where ( ) ( )0,1 1,1 0,2 1,2β β β β βΔ = − − −                 (1) 
and βj,λ is the propagation constant of the jth–order guided mode of λ. Because of inherent weak 
wavelength dispersion, |Δβ| is usually very small and a long Lc is therefore required. A few 
approaches have been reported for reducing Lc [10]-[13]. In [10], only the fundamental and 
second-order modes were excited by a symmetric input in a three-moded waveguide, and Δβ was 
modified by Δβ=(β0,1-β2,1)-(β0,2-β2,2) and increased. Lc could be further reduced using highly 
dispersive structures, such as bulb-shaped waveguides [11] and bent waveguides [12]. 
Nevertheless, the devices using the later two approaches generally suffered high insertion loss up 
to 5 dB and difficulty of theoretical modeling. Recently we reported a novel grating-assisted TMI 
multiplexer, where β0,1 (for λ1=1.56μm) and β1,2 (for λ2=1.34 μm) were both increased by the 
mode-selective dispersion property of a symmetric tooth-shaped grating structure [13]. The 
device was 2-dimensionally (2-D) simulated using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. 
It was shown that the coupler length Lc of 1.3-μm and 1.5-μm demultiplexing was half shortened 
by the toothed grating compared to the regular TMI multiplexers of no grating. Channel contrasts 
~12 dB and insertion losses ~ 2 dB were achieved. In this report, we proposed a novel 
grating-assisted TMI multiplexer where the wavelengths of 1570 nm and 1530 nm were separated 
in an ultra-short coupler length ~57 μm by the grating structure, with insertion losses ~ 2 dB and 
channel contrasts up to 20 dB.  
 
II. DEVICE DESIGN AND THEORY 
The 2-D schematic design of a novel grating-assisted TMI multiplexer was illustrated in 
Figure 1. It is assumed that the transverse dimension (y-axis) of the waveguide is small and 
uniform such that electromagnetic field in the transverse dimension is single-moded and behaves 
the same everywhere over the x-z plane. The problem can thus be simulated and analyzed as a 2D 
device structure without losing much generality. A single-moded input entered and excited the 
fundamental and first-order modes in a two-moded waveguide which was etched symmetrically 
at x=0 and periodically along the z propagation direction. It could be thought of as a 
co-directional coupler consisting of two very close single-moded waveguides that were connected

obtained and shown in Figure 3. The input was a Gaussian TE pulsed of central wavelength at 
1.55μm and full-width at half-magnitude (FWHM) 3×10-15 second.

III. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS 
Using continuous-wave (CW) TE inputs of λ2 and λ1, the TMI patterns were simulated and 
shown, respectively in Figure 5. The wavelengths were separated right after the 100-period 
grating region. The coupler length was about 57 μm. The dispersive effects on shortening the 
coupler length can be verified by comparing the coupler lengths between the grating-assisted case 
and the cases of no grating.

IV. CONCLUSION 
A novel grating-assisted TMI waveguide-to-waveguide wavelength multiplexer was 
proposed and demonstrated using 2-D FDTD simulation method. Using the mode-selective 
dispersion near the photonic bandgap contributed by the grating, the wavelengths of 1570 nm and 
1530 nm were divided in a short coupler length Lc =57 μm with the insertion losses of about 2 dB 
and the channel isolation contrasts of 20 dB. Physics of the device based on the dispersive ω–K 
relation near a photonic bandgap was discussed and illustrated. The work here provides an 
alternative choice of wavelength filtering design that is compact, efficient and easily modeled.
