predominant ionic defects. The oxygen 
vacancy concentration and concomitant 
oxide ion conductivity, in CeO2 can be 
increased by the substitution of a 
lower-valent metal such as Y, 5 Sm,6,7 
Gd,8,9 and Ca.10 Pure CeO2 ceramics is a 
poor oxide ion conductor. However, the 
ion conductivity can be significantly 
improved by increasing the oxygen 
vacancies by the substi tution of 
samarium, which is lower than 4+ in 
valence and upon substituting for Ce4+ 
are charge compensated by oxygen  
vacancies, for example, 
 
Sm2O3 ⎯⎯ →⎯ 2CeO 2 mS ′ ce + 3Oxo + V‥o 
 
In general, decreasing the thickness of 
the electrolyte can further reduce the 
resistance to ionic transport and lower 
operating temperature of SOFC.11 Tape 
casting is mainly used to manufacture 
thin flat ceramic sheet. The thickness of 
tape casting products is typically 20 μm 
to a few millmeters. Some applications 
inc lude  t ransducers ,  capac i tors , 
pyroelectric infrared detectors and 
SOFC.12 Accordingly, in this study, we 
use tape cast ing to produce the 
electrolyte film of SDC for SOFC.  
Traditionally, tape casting was done 
using organic solvents. Because of 
environmental, health, safety, and 
economic reasons, aqueous tape casting 
is replacing the solvent form of tape 
casting.13 Although, aqueous tape 
casting possessed above-mentioned 
advantages, there are still several 
problems such as higher crack sensitivity, 
slow drying of the tape, flocculation and 
poor wetting of the slips.14, 15 The 
stability and rheological properties of 
ceramic suspension are influenced by 
many factors, such as pH, type and 
amount of dispersant and, the number of 
active groups on the powder surface. 
The stability and rheological properties 
of nanosized ceramics powders are more 
c o m p l e x  d u e  t o  t h e  p a r t i c l e 
interactions.16, 17 In this article,the 
rheological behavior of the slurries with 
addition of dispersant, binder, and 
plasticizer is studied. The stability of 
SDC suspension influenced by pH is 
also investigated.

 Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) was synthesized 
by a coprecipitation method. The 
detailed procedure is described as follow, 
stoichiometric amounts of cerium nitrate 
hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3‧6H2O), and 
s a m a r i u m  n i t r a t e  h e x a h y d r a t e 
(Sm(NO3)3‧6H2O) were dissolved in 
distilled water. The final concentration 
of the stock solution was 0.2 M for Ce3+. 
Then the ammonia (NH4OH) solution 
was  added  to  n i t ra tes  so lu t ion , 
precipitates were form until pH = 9.5. 
T h e  r e s u l t i n g  p r e c i p i t a t e  w a s 
vacuum-filtered, washed three times 
with water and ethanol, respectively. 
Then, precipitate was dried at 80oC in an 
oven. The coprecipitation hydrate 
powder decomposed to a polycrystalline 
oxide by heating to 600oC for 2 h. The 
 4
range of 3-10, indicating that the 
electrostatic repulsion between SDC 
particles is insufficient for stabilizing 
suspension in the absence of dispersant. 
For the suspension containing 2.0 wt% 
PAA dispersant, the maximum zeta 
potential (absolute value) was about 40 
mV at pH range 9-10. Therefore, we 
used dispersant of 2.0 wt% PAA for the 
tape  cas t ing  s lurry  prepara t ion . 
Noticeably, the dispersant amount is 
greatly affected the interaction between 
SDC particles in aqueous suspensions. 
Figure 2 shows the structure of PAA. 
The function groups of PAA consist of 
carboxylic acid (COOH) groups, which 
can exist as COOH or dissociated to 
COO-. The dissociation is written as  
follows, 
 
A-COOH + H2O ↔ A-COO- + H3O+ 
 
Depending on the pH and ionic 
concentration of the solvent, the fraction 
of function groups which are dissociated 
(COO-) and those which are not 
dissociated (COOH) will alter19. With 
increasing the fraction dissociated, the 
charge on the polymer altered from 
neutral to highly negative. In general, as 
the pH increased,  the extent  of 
dissociation and negative charge of the 
polymer increase for  PAA. This 
behavior demonstrates that as pH 
increased, a more negative charge 
adsorbed on the particle double layer. It 
rendered the zeta potential trended to  
negative.    
  According to the literature reported 
that metal ions on the surface oxide 
layer behaved as a Lewis acid.18 In the 
present of water, they might tend to 
coordinate H2O molecules. Most oxide 
surface are hydrate, for an oxide of a 
metal, there will be MOH group on the 
surface.19 Figure 3 illustrates the surface 
charge on CeO2 particles in acid or basic 
solutions. In acid solutions, adsorption 
of H+ ions leads a positively charge 
surface, whereas in basic solutions, 
adsorption of OH- ions produces a 
negatively charge surface. Therefore, in 
this case, the dissociative chemisorption 
of water molecules led to a hydroxylate 
on surface, which was known to 
specif ical ly  adsorb H+  and OH-  
according to follow equation:15, 18

particle packing is ascribed the fact that 
the SDC suspensions dispersed well. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, PAA as dispersant, PVA 
as binder, PEG as plasticizer, and 
deionized water as solvent, flexible and 
smooth of SDC tapes have been 
successfully produced by tape casting 
process. The zeta potential measurement 
revealed that IEP for SDC powders in 
the absence of dispersant PAA had  
a pH value of 3.23. In the presence  
of different dispersants in the range  
of 0.5~2 wt% PAA, the IEP do not 
change obviously. For aqueous SDC 
suspensions, the pH value greatly affects 
the rheology of the slurries. The result 
revealed that the optimum pH value of 
the slurry was in the range of 9-10. In 
the presence of 2 wt% PAA, 55 wt% 
SDC powders exhibited shear thinning 
behavior, indicating that SDC slurry was 
homogenous and well stabilized. The 
homogenous of particle packing may be 
due to the shear thinning behavior of the 
slurries. For green tape, both side of the 
green tapes revealed smooth surfaces.  
No cracks were detected.
