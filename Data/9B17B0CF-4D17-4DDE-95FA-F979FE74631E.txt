The Research and Development of High Strength Recycled Soil Materials 
Abstract：This study attempts to develop a recyclable, high strength, ecological soil material that is 
free of conventional cement and is without pollution, named High Strength Ecological Soil Material 
(HSESM). The production of high strength ecological soil material involves four steps: (1) calcinate 
soil minerals to very high temperatures, (2) add active minerals, (3) disintegrate silicate and 
aluminate monomers using concentrated alkali, and, (4) re-polymerize the soil material to a polymer 
that resembles the structure of zeolite using Na2SiO4. The results of the study shows that the 28 day 
compressive strength of high strength ecological soil material exceeds 20 MPa, with flexural 
strength in the order of 10% of its compressive strength. The level of permeability of this material is 
categorized as moderate according to ASTM C1202-97. Discarded HSESM can be reverted back to 
powder using jaw crushers and mechanical grinding facilities. Through the four steps presented, the 
recycled HSESM can be reused again.

Introduction 
Facing pressures from population growth, 
diminishing resources and a deteriorating 
environment in the 21th century, humans need 
to urgently search for an effective ecological 
material to help balance the relationship 
between exploitation of natural resources and 
the living environment; a material that does not 
create waste to natural resources and yet 
contributes to protection of the environment. 
The production of traditional cementitious 
materials advances the deterioration of 
environment and cause resource problems. This 
has urged men to actively develop a new type 
of ecological material that is low in energy and 
material consumption and is recyclable. 
  Geopolymeric cement is a new type of 
alkali-activated binding material that is 
different to conventional Portland cement. It is 
an inorganic polymer that consists of organic 
polymeric structures. The basic structure is 
alumino-silicate tetrahedra linked mainly by 
ionic and covalent bonds, and supplemented by 
Van der Waal bonds. This structure is what 
distinguishes the unique performance of the 
material (Davidovits 1991, 2002). The concept 
of geopolymer was proposed by the French 
scientist Professor Davidovits (1991). This new 
type of binding material is derived from the 
dissolution of metakaolin in an alkaline 
medium, where the minerals are disintegrated 
into monomers and re-polymerized to form a 
new structural arrangement. Three types of 
crystalline structures are identified according to 
the molecular structure of the geopolymer 
(Davidovits 1999, 2002):

700oC for 4hr is used as base material. Fly ash 
and slag powder are added to increase the SiO2 
and Al2O3 content. The chemical compositions 
of fly ash, slag powder and clay material before 
and after calcinating are given in Table 1. 
 
High Strength Ecological Soil Material 
Mixtures and Production 
 
A total of 5 HSESM mixtures and 4 recycled 
HSESM mixtures were established for this 
research (Table 2). Four main steps are 
necessary to produce HSESM. The first step is 
to obtaining a certain reactivity of clay minerals 
through a thermal activation process. By 
calcinating the clay minerals to a temperature 
of 700oC, clay minerals are dehydroxylated, 
resulting in an unstable and near amorphous 
state of the soil. The second step is to increase 
the SiO2 and Al2O3 of calcined clay by addition 
of fly ash or slag powder. The third step 
involves disintegrating the solid network in an 
alkali hydroxide medium to produce reactable 
silicate and aliminate monomers. In the fourth 
step, silicate and aluminate monomers are 
condensed to a stable polymer network, 
forming HSESM. The production of HSESM is 
given in a schematic diagram shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Casting and Curing of Test Specimens 
 
For each mix of HSESM (HS-1~HS-5) and 
recycled HSESM (RS-1~RS-4), a total of 16 
test cylinders (100×200 mm) and 8 flexural 
beam specimens (76.2×76.2×285.8 mm) were 
prepared; a total of 144 test cylinders and 72 
beams were cast for this study. After casting, 
test specimens were covered with plastic sheets 
and left in the casting room for 72 hours at a 
temperature of about 23oC. Then, the molds of 
the specimens were striped and the specimens 
placed into a 100% RH moist curing room at 
23±1.7oC until the time of test. 
 
Compressive Strength Tests 
 
Test cylinders were removed from the moist 
curing room at various ages for testing (7, 28 
and 90 day). The 100 × 200 mm test cylinders 
were tested in accordance with ASTM C39-03 
at each test age to determine the compressive 
strengths. For the 7 day compressive strength 
tests, 2 cylinders were tested and the average of 
the strength results was calculated as the test 
result. For the 28 and 90 day compressive 
strengths, the average of 3 test results were 
calculated as the compressive strength result.

Recycling of the HSESM 
 
The discarded test specimens (HS-1 to HS-5) 
after conducting compressive and flexural 
strengths tests were being reused. The 
specimens were first crushed and milled to 
reduce the powder particle size to less than 
0.15mm. A schematic diagram showing the 
recycling process of HSESM is presented in 
Fig. 3. The mix proportions and properties of 
recycled HSESM are summarized in Tables 1, 
2 and 4, and plotted in Figs. 4, 5 and 6.

Chloride Permeability Characteristics Test 
Results  
According to the classification of permeability 
characteristics in concrete (Feldman et al. 1994 
and Wee et al. 2000), the level of resistance to 
permeation in traditional concrete is high when 
W/C > 0.6; the level of resistance is moderate 
when W/C = 0.4~0.6; and, the level of 
resistance is low when W/C < 0.4. Fig. 6 shows 
the relationships between charge passing 
through the specimens and their ages for each 
HSESM mix. With reference to the levels of 
resistance to chloride ion penetration as 
specified in ASTM C1202-97, it can be 
determined from Fig. 6 that the level of 
resistance to chloride ion penetration for 
HSESM is moderate level. 
 
Performance of Recycled HSESM 
 
From Figs. 4 ~ 5, the compressive and flexural 
strengths of recycled HSESM mixes (RS-1 ~ 
RS-4) are significantly higher than the basic 
mixes (HS-1 ~ HS-4). This is due to recycled 
HSESM mixes containing higher contents of 
Al2O3 than original clay materials. Fig. 6 shows 
that the resistance to chloride ion penetration of 
recycled HSESM mixes (RS-1 ~ RS-4) is 
similar to that of basic mixes (HS-1 ~ HS-4), 
both falling within the moderate level. This 
may perhaps be due to the polymerization 
characteristics of HSESM, which did not seem 
to have increased the level of resistance to 
chloride penetration from an increase in Al2O3 
content. 
 
Porosity Test Results 
 
Table 5 presents the porosity, dry density and 
saturated density for each HSESM mix 
calculated from Eq. 2. From this table, it can be 
seen that the porosity of HSESM is in the range 
of 30% ~ 40%, dry density in the region of 
1.56~1.65 g/cm3, and saturated density in the 
region of 1.76~1.94 g/cm3. Hence, HSESM is a 
porous light weight material, which is highly 
related to its similarity to zeolite structures.

Conclusions 
This study explored the production process 
and mechanical properties of high strength 
soil materials (HSESM). Scrapped HSESM 
has also been successfully been recycled to 
produce HSESM again. From the results 
presented and discussed, the following 
conclusions can be drawn. 
1. The production of HSESM involves 
dehydroxylating soil minerals by 
calcinating them. Then adding active 
minerals and dissolving calcined soil in 
NaOH, soil and active minerals are 
disintegrated into silicate and aluminate 
monomers. The last step involves using 
Na2SiO4 to polymerize the monomers to a 
form HSESM which has a structure similar 
to that of zeolite.

 ABSTRACT  
This study is to evaluate the safety of a sea levee under earthquake 
condition. The evaluation is performed by both theoretical analysis in 
stability and numerical simulation, besides a case in field is adopted to 
verified the analysis and simulation. Since a sea levee is subjected a 
combined forces and stresses, such as, wave force, earth pressure, self-
weight, pore water pressure, and forces induced form earthquake, the 
theoretical analysis may obtain a closed-form solution, however, the 
complicated field condition may not be included in the analysis. A 
software with finite element method is used to simulate the complicated 
conditions. The revetment of a sea levee which found on a thick deposit 
with saturated loose sand may collapse or slide soil liquefaction as 
deposit subjected by earthquake force. The results also revealed that the 
hazards caused by an earthquake are not damage of the levee itself. 
Instead, the flood due to the collapse of the levee structure may induce 
the major disasters.

INTRODUCTION 
Since 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake took place at the middle of Taiwan, the 
accompanied shallow seismic motions exerted a great impact on the 
riverbanks, sea levees, reservoirs, dams, weir, watercourses as well as 
farmland facilities and induced lots of serious damages. The failure 
modes include cracking, distortion, sliding, collapse, heaving, 
avalanche and especially the soil liquefaction. It was found that 
approximately 220m in accumulation of sea levees were damaged 
during this seismic excitation at the seafront of Chang-Hua County. 
Among those sea levees, some were damaged in collapse due to soil 
liquefaction, such as Han-Pao sea levee, Chang-Hua levee way, Chao-
Yang-Cuo sea levee, Siasi-Chian sea levee, Shan-Keng sea levee and 
Siahai-Chian sea levee. It is revealed from the above field cases that the 
destructive power of the unexpected seismic loading was more 
intensive than the induced wave forces exerting on the rigid-type sea 
levee structures. One of the reasons is that in front of sea levees along 
west coast of Taiwan, there are usually the flat shoals which weaken 
the wave forces. In this study, an in-situ case, Yang-Zu-Cuo sea levee,  
was introduced to evaluate the safety of the sea levee by using the 
theoretical analysis and software simulation. Fig. 1 indicates the flow 
chart of the study. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
INFORMATION OF CONCERNED SEA LEVEE 
Location, Dimensions and Materials 
Yang-Zu-Cuo sea levee, located at the outfall of Yang-Zu-Cuo river in 
Chang-Hua county (refer to Fig.2), was selected as the analyzed and 
simulated object in this paper. The Yang-Zu-Cuo sea levee is designed 
as composite type of sea levee as shown in Fig.3.  The height and width 
of the levee top are 4.5m and 3m respectively. The front slope ratio of 
the levee is 1 to 2 (for V to H). Below 1.78 m from the top, the levee is 
protected by rubbles with a slope 1:4 to the toe. The back slope ratio of 
the levee is 1 to 1.5 (for V to H) and protected from 2.5 m below the 
top by using natural graded materials and served as an access way. The

the weight of structure and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) which can 
be a function of the site district, soil properties and importance of the 
structure and so on. It can be expressed as follows, 
Seismic Load=(Self Weight＋Surcharge)×(PGA/g) ………………..(2) 
In this case, the PGA=0.127g, measured from Ho-Mei primary school 
seismic station (refer to Fig.2) during Chi-Chi Earthquake, was used to 
calculate the seismic load for stability analysis. 
Resistant Forces 
The resistant forces required to stabilize the levee are the self-weight of 
levee and the horizontal friction at the foundation. 
For easy calculation, the levee body was divided into six blocks in 
cross-section as shown in Fig.5. For conservative analysis, the 
contribution of the rubbles coverage and its function to reduce the 
flushing height of sea water were not considered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability Analysis of Sea Levee 
The stability analysis of the sea levee can be performed in terms of 
overturning, horizontal sliding, seepage, liquefaction and foundation.  
The later three items were performed by way of numerical analysis 
which will be addressed and highlighted in next sections. Both typhoon 
and earthquake were considered as three cases in the analysis. Case1: 
Typhoon Only, Case2: Earthquake Only and Case3: Typhoon and 
Earthquake Simultaneously. The case in typhoon indicates the case of 
storm-tide condition which would induce the wave pressure and uplift 
force under the sea levee. It is obvious that case 3 is the most severe 
condition which is not frequent adopted by designer due to the 
economic reason. The analysis results are shown in Table 2.

It is depicted in Table 2 that except Case 3 in sliding, Yang-Zu-Cuo sea 
levee shows its good performance of composite design in the stability 
analysis. In the Case 2, FS Overturning is very high as of 55.99 which is 
due to its shape in shortness and flatness. However, in 1999 Chi-Chi 
Earthquake, part of this levee was damaged in collapse due to the soil 
liquefaction. Hence, a numerical analysis using GeoStudio 2004 was 
adopted to approach its failure mode of the foundation. 
NUMERICAL ANALYSIS 
A series of simulations was performed by using three modules, 
SEEP/W, QUAKE/W and SIGMA/W in GeoStudio 2004. First, 
SEEP/W module was adopted to analyze tide-induced seepage behavior. 
Next, QUAKE/W module was used to simulate the post-earthquake soil 
liquefaction potential of the levee foundation and related excess pore 
water pressure (EPWP). Last, based on the EPWP obtained from 
QUAKE/W, SIGMA/W module was utilized to process the estimation 
of the post-liquefaction ground settlement. 
Seepage Analysis  
SEEP/W module provides a steady-mode analysis on the foundation 
seepage during the storm tide period. The analysis is based on the 
assumptions that the composite sea levee was constructed on a 
permeable base and levee body was impermeable in good quality. 
(1)Simulation procedures 
The general procedures of SEEP/W module are: c Build Mesh, d 
Assign materials, e Assign Soil parameters and other properties, 
fBoundary conditions and flow section. Fig. 6 shows the meshes of 
numerical simulation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)Simulation results 
The main outcomes of SEEP/W are the flow lines, equal potential lines, 
velocity vectors and pore water pressure at the bottom of the levee body. 
Figs. 7 and 8 show the flow lines and equal potential lines of the levee 
during the storm tide. It can be found that the top flow line is beneath 
the levee base and the highest velocity vector occurs at the toe of the 
levee because of its highest gradient.  The induced pore water pressure 
at the base during storm tide is shown in Fig.9. It is indicated the 
pressure head at Heel (X=38） is 38.32 kPa and pressure head at toe 
(X=63) is 17.87 kPa.

LIQUEFACTION-INDUCED SETTLEMENT 
The above settlement analysis was performed based on the 
consolidation theory using the dissipation of the induced pore water 
pressure after earthquake. It is interesting to compare it with the post-
liquefaction settlement based on the volumetric strain method proposed 
by Tokimatsu and Seed in 1987. By using the normalized SPT blow 
count (N1)60 and Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR) to liquefaction, the 
volumetric strain could be determined at each depths of the SPT 
samples. Fig.13 displays the scattered data allocated the volumetric 
strains in respect to each depth. The respective settlements at depths 
were obtained by multiplying the volumetric strain with the layer 
thickness. The summation of the respective settlements yields the total 
settlement induced by soil liquefaction. Table 3 depicts the calculation 
of the settlements which indicates the total settlement is about 22 cm.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is believed that the above calculation tends to be somewhat of 
overestimation as the method was developed for clean sands. (E. 
Kavazanjian, et al., 1997). In other words, under the seismic level of 
PGA=0.127g, the post-liquefaction settlements of the sea levee would 
be much less than those consolidation settlements obtained from the 
numerical analysis. However, the localized settlement might result in 
the stress concentration on the rigid concrete protection cover and if it 
exceeded the strength of the concrete, the cracks and gaps would yield 
accordingly. Subsequently, the cracks on the concrete cover would be 
enlarged if they subject to attacks from waves or storm tide and then 
erosion occur. The concrete cover begins to move, slide or suspend as a 
hollow shell. If the countermeasure was not carried out in time, the sea 
levee would be destroyed eventually under the progressive erosions. 
Besides, the protection rubbles would possibly sink after the attacks 
from the waves. 
Photo 1 illustrated the phenomenon occurred at similar sea levee after 
1999 Chi-Chi earthquake’s attack.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Through the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation on the Yang-
Zu-Cuo sea levee, some conclusions can be summarized as follows, 
 
(1). Stability analysis of the sea levee is important but not the critical. A 
further analysis on the foundation in terms of soil liquefaction and 
settlement plays a critical role in the safety evaluation. 
(2). GeoStudio 2004 presents a good performance in the linked 
analyses on the hydraulic structures. Through the linked modules, we 
can obtain the seepage-induced pore water pressure, soil liquefaction 
distribution and settlements after earthquake. However note that, the 
analysis outcome could be a preliminary study only due to its 
simplified assumptions. 
(3) In the evaluation, the levee body was assumed as impermeable 
material which implied that the construction quality is quite high. 
Nevertheless, the field compaction work seldom makes the body 
impermeable, but instead, it depends on the water-tightness and 
strengths of the concrete protection covers. Hence, how to prevent the 
damage of the cover and the settlements of the levee body would be an 
important course for the safety of the sea levee.
