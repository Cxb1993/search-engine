Main text 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Gas-solid fluidized bed system has been extensively employed in many industrial processes 
including mixing, drying, fluid catalytic cracking, coal combustion, gasification, etc.  Among 
these processes, wide range of operating conditions is covered from the bubbling, the turbulent to 
the fast fluidization flow regimes among which the performance of fluidized beds is quite different.  
Thus, effective and exact discrimination of flow regimes is quite important and essential prior to 
any practical application.  Yerushalmi et al. (1978) first proposed a quantitative criterion by 
means of relative fluctuations of pressure drop across the bed.  They defined Uc, where the 
relative pressure fluctuations reach a maximum, as the onset velocity of the transition from 
bubbling to turbulent flow regime and Uk as the onset velocity of turbulent flow regime where the 
relative pressure fluctuations decay from Uc  and begin to level off.  However, some researchers 
considered that the turbulent regime starts at Uc (Cai et al., 1990; Chehbouni et al. 1994; Chen and 
Bi, 2003; Grace and Sun, 1991; Kashkin et al. , 2003; Lee and Kim, 1988; Makkawi and Wright, 
2002; Rhodes, 1996, etc.).  Also, inconsistent position of Uk exits in literatures.  Rhodes and 
Geldart (1986) stated that Uk, at which a “reflux transport” is presented, is akin to choking velocity.  
Uk is affected by the position of pressure tapping and is considered to be strongly affected by the 
configuration and solids return system.  Lee and Kim (1988) used the skewness and flatness of 
pressure fluctuations to determine the transition from bubbling to turbulent regime.  They found 
the maximum point of flatness and the minimum point of skewness indicate the transition velocity 
Uc, however, Uk is not obtained in their studies.  Bi and Fan (1992) found turbulent flow regime 
exists only for Geldart group A particles (Ar<125) and Uk which marks the end of this regime 
decreases with the increasing of the column diameter.  For Geldart group B and D particles 
(Ar>125), Uk is equal to Utr and doesn’t change apparently with the column diameter.  Chehbouni 
et al. (1994) stated that Uk is just an artifact due to using differential pressure measurement and 
turbulent flow regime starts then at Uc and ends at the Utr.  Recently, Makkawi and Wright (2002) 
demarcated Uc and Uk by means of electrical capacitance tomography (ETC) and elucidated that 
turbulent fluidization begins at Uc and ends at Uk.  Nowadays, Uc is generally accepted as the 
onset gas velocity of turbulent fluidization, however,  Uk is not a well-defined transition velocity 
and exists doubtfully.    
signals of pressure fluctuations in a pressurized bubble column.  They found the detail signals 
maybe directly relate to the bubble behaviors and their energies provide analogous information as 
the change of major frequency in Fourier power spectrum.  Ellis et al. (2003) characterized the 
dynamic behaviors of void and dense phase in the turbulent flow regime by wavelet analysis  on 
the local voidage fluctuation signals.  They considered that the finer-scale details  of the 
decomposed voidage signal are originated from the particle movement and the coarser-scale detail 
sand approximations are mainly produced from the void movement.  Furthermore, the statistical 
distribution (skewness and kurtosis) of these decomposed signals in the turbulent flow regime 
show significant difference from that in the bubbling flow regime.  Shou and Leu (2005a, 2005b) 
successively characterized different flow regimes of FCC and sand particles in a circulating 
fluidized bed by the wavelet energy distribution of pressure fluctuating data.  They further 
determined the transition velocities Uc and Uk by the method combining the power spectral density 
function and wavelet analysis of absolute pressure fluctuations. 
So far the wavelet analysis has been considered as a powerful tool for investigating the signal 
with multi-scale components as well as the pressure fluctuations in the fluidized bed systems.  In 
this study we attempted to examine the transition velocities Uc and Uk in circulating fluidized bed 
systems via traditional statistical analysis and multi-resolution analysis of wavelet transformation 
on the absolute pressure fluctuation signals .  The effects of the axial position of pressure probe 
and the static bed height were also investigated.  Multi-resolution analysis  was formulated in 
order to relate the energy of wavelet multi-scales and the characteristic hydrodynamics in the 
fluidized beds with different kind of bed materials .  This methodology was expected to express 
better capability and higher flexibility on analyzing multi-scale structure from the bubbling to the 
turbulent flow regimes in the fluidized beds.  
 
2. Experimental 
Experiments were carried out in three circulating fluidized beds of 70 mm-i.d.×2.2 m-high  
(CFB-A), 108 mm-i.d.×7 m-high (CFB-B) and 108 mm-i.d.×5.75 m-high (CFB-C).  The details 
of CFB-C was shown elsewhere (Shou and Leu, 2005a).  Both CFB-A and CFB-B were  made of 
transparent Plexiglas colu mn equipped with an L-valve for returning the entrained particles, as 
shown schematically in Fig. 1.  The perforated plates with free area 3.02 % (CFB-A) and 9.33 % 
(CFB-B) were used as the gas distributor.  Ambient air was supplied by Roots blower to fluidize

where time shift k=1,2,… ,N/2j and level j=1,2,… ,J.  J corresponding to scale 2J of the base 
functions is the maximum level of wavelet transform and it is dependent on f, ?  and N.  Fig.2 
shows the dilated and translated forms of the Symlet wavelet. When j gets larger, the scale 2j gets 
larger and the functions fj,k(t) and ? j,k(t) become wider and spread out (Bruce and Gao, 1996).   In 
this study, the forth-order Symlet wavelet (sym4) was used as transform function to carryout DWT 
on pressure fluctuation signals.  Thus, the wavelet transform of x(t) can be obtained by Eq. (4) 
and Eq. (5), 
ò= (t)dt(t) ,, kJkJ xs f  (4) 
ò= (t)dt(t) ,, kjkj xd y  (5) 
where sJ,k and dj,k are called the approximation/smooth and detail coefficients respectively.  
Roughly speaking, sJ,k mainly represents the smooth behavior of x(t) at the coarser scale and dj,k 
represents the detail part at the finer scale.  The later also provides the deviation between two 
successive scales of smooth coefficients sj,k and sj-1,k.  Consequently, x(t) can be reconstructed by 
Eq. (6)

3.3 Multi-resolution analysis (MRA) 
MRA decomposes the signal into orthogonal signal components which represent the 
components of x(t) at different resolutions/scales.  At each level j, the approximation signal AJ(t) 
and the detail signals Dj(t) can be obtained by the follows,

However a systematic investigation about the effects of axial position of pressure probe z and 
static bed height Hs on Uc  and Uk obtained from absolute pressure fluctuations is still lacking.  In 
the following sections effects of z and Hs had been appropriately discussed.  
[Insert Figure 3, Table 2] 
 
4.1.1 Uc and Uk at different axial positions 
As shown in Fig. 3, Uc was almost independent of axial positions from the gas distributor for 
both FCC and glass beads particles.  However, Uk decreased slightly with increasing the axial 
position of pressure probe and only was detected at the specific axial positions (see Figs. 3 (c) and 
(d) for FCC and Figs. 3 (h), (i), (j) and (k) for glass beads).  This result differed from the result of 
Chehbouni et al. (1994) who proposed that Uk can’t be found by using absolute pressure 
fluctuations measurement and only is detected by means of differential pressure transducer.  
Based on our observation, beyond Uc, increasing the superficial gas velocity would lead the level 
of bed surface (i.e. the interface between the dense bed and the splash zone) to drop downward.  
Meanwhile, the standard deviation of the absolute pressure fluctuations attenuated gradually.  As 
further increasing the gas velocity, more and more solid particles were entrained into the splash 
zone.  Then the level of bed surface dropped below the pressure probe and exposed it to the 
splash zone.  The variance of the standard deviation consequently became smoother.  In such 
case, the pressure probe at higher axial position was exposed to the splash zone earlier than that 
located at lower axial position.  Therefore , a lower value of Uk was obtained at higher position.  
Rhodes and Geldart (1986) who also found that Uk decreases with increasing of the distance of the 
upper pressure tapping from the distributor, though differential pressure fluctuations measurement 
was used in their study.  To further verify the above contention, the change of dense bed height of 
FCC particles with superficial gas velocity was observed virtually, as shown in Fig. 4.  The gas 
velocities, at which the level of bed surface approached the pressure probes located at z=0.4 m and 
z=0.3 m, were about 0.97 m/s and 1.05 m/s respectively (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4).  They 
were well consistent with Uk  depicted in Figs. 3 (c) and (d).  Thus Uk was preferentially  detected 
by the pressure probe located at higher positions in the dense bed.  In other word, when the 
pressure probe was located near the gas distributor or in the splash zone/freeboard during the 
presented for FCC and sand particles in this study.  Fig. 6 (a) shows the standard deviation of 
APF at z=0.2 and 0.5 m against es for FCC particles in the CFB-C system.  This diagram 
indicates that the peak values of standard deviation of APF (where es=0.32) measured at the upper 
(z=0.4 m) and the lower (z=0.1 m) positions of dense bed were almost the same and the 
corresponding gas velocity was closed to the Uc determined by the standard deviation of APF 
versus the riser gas velocity.  It implied that Uc was almost not affected by the axial positions of 
APF measurement.  When the gas velocity was continuously increased to 1.18 m/s, the flow 
pattern observed at the upper position began to change from the turbulent to the fast fluidization 
flow regime, as the corresponding es=0.14 approached the critical solid hold-up between the 
turbulent and the fast fluidization as suggested by Bai et al. (1996).  Simultaneously, the flow 
pattern at the lower position still maintained in the turbulent fluidization flow regime  with es=0.24.  
Besides, the es at the lower position was somewhat larger than that at the higher position between 
Uo ranged from 1.00 to 1.45 m/s, as shown in Fig. 6 (b).  The superficial gas velocities, Uo=1.1 
m/s at z=0.5 m and Uo=1.36 m/s at z=0.2 m, beyond which the es suddenly dropped were almost 
identical with the points where the standard deviations of APF began to level off in Fig. 6 (a).  
This velocity was consequently regarded as Uk.  The same result also could be found for the sand 
particles, as shown in Fig. 7.  This figure indicates that there was an obvious leveling–off of 
standard deviation as the es of sand particles decreased from 0.3 to 0.1 and the gas velocity 
corresponding to the critical solid hold-up (es=0.19) was quite close to Uk determined from Fig. 5 
(b) by standard deviation of APF.  Summarizing these results we could conclude that, 
l Regime transition from turbulent to the fast fluidization happened earlier at the upper axial 
position, as well as mentioned by Rhodes and Geldart (1986), then developed downward in 
the dense bed. 
l The leveling-off of the standard deviation of APF at Uk corresponding to the regime 
transition was mainly attributed to the sudden decrease of solid hold-up at the observation 
position, in the other word, Uk was apparently relative to the variation of mean solid 
hold-up around the pressure probe and could be identified as the pressure probe was 
exposed from the dense phase to the relatively dilute phase.

phenomenon also directly projected on the PSDF of pressure fluctuation signals.  As shown in 
Fig. 8 (b), the bandwidth of PSDF became wider as the static bed height decreased and some 
minor frequencies appeared at higher values.  It provided  the evidence that bubbles/slugs 
collapsed earlier for the lower static bed height thus caused Uc to decrease with decreasing the 
static bed height.  Besides, the decreas e of Uk can be contributed to the descent of interface 
between dense bed and splash zone as the static bed height is decreased (Mori et al., 1992).  
Lower level of interface exposed the pressure probes in the splash zone at lower gas velocity, thus 
a smaller value of Uk was obtained.

4.1.3 The choice of appropriate measurement location 
According to the above discussion, different flow patterns could be observed at different axial 
positions in the fluidized beds.  The transition velocities between different flow regimes were  
affected by both static bed height and axial position of pressure probe.  Thus, an appropriate 
measurement location should be necessary in order to accurately detect the regime transition.  
Figs. 9(a) and (b) show the relative axial position (z/Hs), defined as the ratio of the axial position 
of probe above the gas distributor to the static bed height, versus transition velocities Uc  and Uk of 
FCC and glass beads.  The result showed that Uc of both FCC particles and glass beads appeared 
no obvious change with z/Hs; however, Uk decreased with increasing z/Hs except at z/Hs=1.5 
where the eruption of bubbles/slugs was considerably violent for glass beads.  Besides, no Uk 
was identified at the highest measuring position (z/Hs=2.0 for FCC and glass beads) where the 
pressure probe was exposed to the splash zone during the whole experimental run.  In the other 
hand, Uk at lower measuring portion of the bed (z/Hs<0.5), where the flow pattern was mostly 
affected by the structure of gas distributor, gas jetting or solid reflux system, was usually not found 
or ambiguous.  Similar trend was also obtained for sand particles as shown in Fig. 10.  Some 
recommendations about the measuring positions had been given by other authors.  Brereton and 
Grace (1992) suggested that the pressure probes should be immersed below the surface of bottom 
dense bed at all time to avoid the region where bubbles/slugs erupt when using instantaneous 
differential pressure measurement.  Bi and Grace (1995) also recommended keeping away the 
pressure measurements from the bed surface for avoiding the apparent transition.  It was worthy 
little difference in comparison with the correlation equations proposed by Horio (1986) and 
Perales et al. (1991) for Geldart A and B group particles respectively.

4.2 Wavelet analysis on pressure fluctuations 
4.2.1 Multi-scale analysis on pressure fluctuations 
In this study, the pressure fluctuation data was separated into three specific scales of subsignal 
by resorting to wavelet multi-resolution decomposition as introduced in sections 3.2 and 3.3.  
They were the micro -scale corresponding with higher frequency and small fluctuations (SF), 
meso-scale corresponding with intermediate frequency and large fluctuations (LF) and 
macro-scale corresponding with lower frequency (DC).  Here the SF subsignal is defined as 
follows,  
å
=
=
m
j
jDSF
1
(t)   (15) 
where m=4 in this work.  The SF subsignal represents a hybrid of details of original signal x(t) 
below level m and has an approximate frequency interval [50/24, 50] Hz.  It mainly captures the 
fluctuations contributes from small and rapid bubbles/voids.  And the definition of LF is given by 
Eq. (16), 
å
+=
=
J
mj
jDLF
1
(t) (16) 
where J=7 is the maximum decomposition level set in this study.  The LF subsignal with 
approximate frequency interval [50/27, 50/24] Hz captures the behavior of large bubbles/voids or 
slugs.  The residual part, DC subsignal, equals to AJ(t) with approximate frequency interval [0, 
50/27], indicates the intensity of moving-average in the original fluctuation signal.  
Figs. 13 (a), (b) and (c) show the original absolute pressure fluctuations and its three scales of 
subsignal obtained from multi-scale analysis of wavelet transform for FCC particles at 0.14, 0.55 
and 0.83 m/s of superficial gas velocities respectively.  The corresponding PSDF was also 
applied for each scale of subsignal to estimate their frequency contents.  In the bubbling flow 
regime, the LF subsignal (the middle top of Fig. 13 (a)) mainly captured the large fluctuations 
caused by relative large bubbles which had a major frequency about 1.2 Hz.  The small 
fluctuations interweaving in LF subsignal was mostly captured by the SF subsignal (the middle 
 4.2.3 Determinate Uc and Uk by HI  
Fig. 15 (a) and (b) show dependency of HI upon the superficial gas velocity for the FCC and 
glass beads respectively.  Four different regions (at least three regions for FCC) can be 
distinguished in the diagrams .  Region I and region II represented the bubbling/slugging flow 
regime; region III represented the turbulent flow regime and region IV was the fast fluidization 
flow regime.  In region I, bubble coalescence dominated and bubble size increased with 
increasing gas velocity causing attenuation of HI.  Near the end of region I, for glass beads, 
bubbles enlarged rapidly to a stable maximum size which was only subject to the diameter of bed 
(Chen and Bi, 2003), large squared-nose slugs appeared and existed for a wide range of gas 
velocity as the region II shown in Fig. 15 (b).  The corresponding HI kept in a low value and 
didn’t vary apparently till the slugs began to breakup at higher gas velocity.  However, for FCC 
particles, the stable maximum bubble size was small (usually less than 10 cm) and clear slugs 
were not observed (Mori et al., 1988).  The bubbles appeared to split and coalesce frequently, so 
that the HI decreased monotonously to a minimum and then increased immediately with 
increasing gas velocity into region III.  Thus, the region I was difficult to be differentiated from 
the region II for fine particles.  Following the region II was the region III after which large slugs 
began to collapse.  In region III there was a progressive extinction of large bubbles/slugs and 
augmented formation of small gas void inside the bed causing increasing of HI.  The 
homogeneity kept increasing with superficial gas velocity until large bubbles/slugs completely 
disappeared.   Hereafter, HI leveled off and the flow regime gradually changed from the turbulent 
to the fast fluidization. 
[Insert Figure 15] 
Cooperating the above discussion and statistic analysis in section 4.1, the transition velocity 
Uc could  be marked as the superficial gas velocity after which HI began to increase obviously, i.e. 
the interface between regions II and III , the big bubbles/slugs began to collapse hereafter.  The 
corresponding gas velocity at the interface between regions II and III was approximately equal to 
the Uc obtained from standard deviation of absolute pressure fluctuations (Figs. 3 (b) and (h )).  
And the approach to the Uk for FCC particles was accompanied by the gas velocity at which the 
HI began to level off after a gradual increase, i.e. the interface between regions III and IV.  While

4.2.5 Effect of static bed height on HI 
 Figs. 17 and 18 show the HI at z=0.1 m and 0.4 m respectively with different static bed 
heights for sand particle  in CFB-B system.  Evidently the higher the static bed height was, the 
lower the HI values was obtained.  The reason corresponding to this result was that the higher Hs 
might produce more stable and larger bubbles in the beds, therefore, less change and lower values 
of HI were found.  Additionally, the Uc  determined from HI for Hs=0.4 m and 0.5 m were almost 
the same (Figs. 17 (b), (c) and Figs. 18 (b ), (c)), however, it was quite different for Hs=0.6 m (Figs. 
17 (a) and 18 (a)).  Significant slugging flow was observed for sand particles of Hs=0.6 m and the 
breakup of large bubbles/slugs would be delayed, as discussed in section 4.1.2.  Hence the Uc of 
Hs=0.6 m, beyond which an obvious increase of HI was observed, was higher than those of Hs=0.4 
m and 0.5 m.   The Uk in these diagrams seemed to be independent of Hs and was somewhat 
lower/larger than the blow out velocity Use as mentioned above.  This fact could imply that the 
slugging flow for the sand particles still existed in the turbulent flow regime and the big 
bubbles/slugs kept breaking down until the fast fluidization flow regime was approached. 
[Insert Figures 17 and 18] 
Based on Figs. 15 and 16, the transition velocities Uc  and Uk were successfully determined by 
the HI curve even at the lower axial position of dense bed where no remarkable Uk was detected 
by the classical standard deviation curve.  Shou and Leu (2005a) also proposed another method 
to identify Uc and Uk of FCC particles by wavelet energy of PSDF of absolute pressure fluctuation 
signals.  At the same time, they successfully identified Uc and Uk of sand particles by the 
standard deviation of wavelet reconstructed pressure signals  (Shou and Leu, 2005b).  Therefore, 
it can be concluded that wavelet analysis is indeed an effective tool for analyzing the pressure 
fluctuations and identifying the transition velocities between different flow regimes in fluidized 
beds.    
 
Fig. 19 shows the comparison of Uc  and Uk, obtained from standard deviation curves (in Figs. 
3 and 5) and HI curves (in Figs. 15 and 16), with the predicted values calculated by Eq. (13) and 
Eq. (14).  The result showed that the transition velocity Ucs determined by the standard deviation 
of APF and HI curve were well coincide with each other.  However, they were somewhat smaller
