Introduction
1.1. Research Motivation
1.1.1. Role of Manufacturing in Precast Construction
Construction is not manufacturing. However, manufacturing provides the elements
from which buildings, bridges, highways, houses, and factories are constructed
(Ballard and Arbulu 2004). These products are produced by fabrication shops, which
sit squarely at the intersection of manufacturing and construction (Walsh et. al. 2004,
Barriga et. al. 2005).
In recent years, due to the escalation of both wages and material prices, technologies
and managerial skills for improving construction performance have been studied.
Numerous methods have been proposed to improve the performance. Precast
construction, one of industrial engineering methods, is among them. Several potential
advantages for precast techniques have been reported, such as speeding up
construction processes, reducing cost of site supervision, reducing delay caused by
inclement weather conditions, better construction quality, better balance of resources
and utilization of skills, and so on (Frondistou-Yannas et. al. 1976, Leu and Hwang
2002, Richardson 1973, Tucker et. al. 1977). Precast construction is built by erecting
pre-cast elements. Those elements are made in factories, out of construction sites, and
then erected in the construction area. As a result, manufacturing of precast elements
directly impacts the success of precast projects (Pheng and Chuan 2001).

Absence of New Thinking
Construction has traditionally tried to improve competitiveness by making
conversions more efficient. But judging from the manufacturing experience,
construction could realize dramatic improvements simply by identifying and
eliminating non conversion (non value-adding) activities (Koskela 1992).
Previous works are focusing on applying traditional thinking (mass production) to
optimize combinational activities. A dramatic improvement must be driven by new
thinking. Applying lean production in the construction industry, known as lean
construction, has been pinpointed as a promising direction to improve construction
performance (Ballard 2000). In precast production scheduling, this new philosophy is
little known.
Ignoring Inventory/buffer Issue
From the perspective of lean, inventory is the root of all evil (Spearman 2002b).
Inman (1993) also said that “inventory is the flower of all evil and variability is its
root.”Previous research works tried to minimize makespan, which keep production
system busy, result inventory. In the contrary, to ultimately remove inventory, pieces
would be manufactured just-in-time for production sites. This can reduce inventory
5Ko and Ballard 2005). Thus, how to protect fabricators against the impact of demand
variability is one of the most important issues for construction industry. Previous
studies have rarely considered demand variability in the production schedules.
1.1.4. Urgency for Integrating Scheduling System with ERP
ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) is a structural system used to enhance internal
value of a company through information management (Langenwalter 2000). It
integrates enterprise resources including financial, accounting, human resources,
fabrication, and delivery. The value stream mapping for precast fabricator is shown in
Figure 1-2. The figure demonstrates the whole picture for the fabrication process:
from order to delivery. Since precast fabricators strive for business success on
delivering products on time, production scheduling is a core for precast fabricator.
The enterprise resources are therefore centered around the production system. The
value of production directly reflects the value of the company. As a result, to enhance
internal value of a company, production scheduling should be the core of ERP system.
Unfortunately, present precast fabricators rarely adopt ERP systems. Besides, they
treat production scheduling as a separated system from the whole value. To enhance
completeness and value for precast company, ERP system should be employed in the
precast enterprise, and production scheduling should be involved as a core in the
system.
7account the impact of limited resources, including equipment and skilled labor, on
production makespan. Also, they found that mixed production gains a potential
advantage over the conventional separate production under resource constraints. A
mixed-production flow-shop scheduling system is proposed in the paper by
considering resource constraints.
The reviewed studies are focusing on developing production schedules. Their
objectives are the same namely to maximize the utilization of resources. Although
those two researches are pioneers in considering resources in precast concrete industry,
the way they deal with resources are “passive.”It means that previous researches
treated resources as constrains rather than management activity. From the perspective
of ERP, resources are planned and scheduled according to needs (production
schedule). It shows that precast concrete industry is still far away from ERP.
In the market, ERP software is available for use, such as SAP, Oracle, Baan, QAD, etc.
Most of that commercial software are expensive and may not be useful due to the
heterogeneity of companies, especially for construction industry. ERP software has to
be built with specific management process with specialized managerial models.
1.1.6. Urgency for Flexible Material Supply
A buffer evaluation, production scheduling, and an ERP system are helpful for precast
fabrication. However, these approaches cannot be realized without sufficient and
flexible material supply; otherwise precast fabricators lose capacity or keep changing
production sequences.
Competitive Market in the Construction Industry
Precast fabricators make material plans primarily depending on experience.
However, the unsystematic manner that making plans depending on subjective
9uncertainties, i.e. material amount and order lead time, faced in material planning
frequently result late material delivery. Production makespan is extended and
risks of late delivery increases consequently. The other challenge encountered
while making material plans is the vibration of material consuming rate, which
increases the risk of material shortage (Shu 2001). One of possibilities to reduce
the risks is adopting strategic cooperation among precast factories. Material
lateral transshipment is a kind of strategic cooperation that transships materials
from manufacturing plants that have sufficient supplies to the others that starve
for materials. Several studies have pinpointed that material lateral transshipment
is efficient and effective in reducing inventory level, holding cost, as well as
reducing risks of late delivery (Axsäter 1990b, Tagaras 1999, and Herer and Tzur
2003).
1.2. Research Objectives
Due to above precast production issues, the primary objective of this research is to
develop an enhanced Precast Production Management System to improve current
precast practice. The sub-objectives required to achieve the primary goal are the
following:
Develop a Time Buffer Evaluation Model (TBEM) to evaluate suitable buffers
required to protect precast fabricators against the impact of variability. This model
determines fabrication due days by considering demand variability using Fuzzy Logic.
Fuzzy Logic is used to deal with uncertainties in the construction industry.
Establish a Production Scheduling Model (PSM) using Multi-Objective Genetic
Algorithms. In this model, limited resources, buffer size, and inventory are considered.
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms are used to search for optimum production
11
Time Buffer Evaluation Model (TBEM) is developed in the phase. Phase II focuses on
searching for (near) optimum production schedules by considering procedures
executed in design and fabrication. Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) are
used as a search engine.

4. Review Related Concepts and Theories
At this junction, the researcher undertakes extensive survey of concepts and theories
connected to the formulated problem to broaden the knowledge base. Academic
journals, conference proceedings, books, websites, published and unpublished reports,
etc. are tapped depending on the problem.
5. Review Previous Research Findings
Previous research findings provide a basement for the development of further research.
In this stage, previous discoveries related to the objectives of this study are
investigated through formal literatures including academic journals, conference
proceedings, books, and published reports.
6. Establish TBEM Architecture
At the beginning of model development, the theoretical and conceptual framework is
established. Three types of buffers are considered in the model: inventory, time, and
capacity. To determine appropriate buffers for fabricators, factors that influence
buffers are firstly investigated. The relationship between influencing factors and
buffers are then identified through statistical and numerical analysis. Finally,
operation methods for calculating buffers are chosen according to the buffering
characteristics.

10. Investigate PrecastERP Requirements
This activity focuses on developing an ERP for precast concrete industry, namely
PrecastERP. Customer management, material requirement planning, and capacity
requirement planning are involved in PrecastERP.
11. Develop PrecastERP Software
The PrecastERP integrates all functions using OO computer techniques. Internet
technology is also applied in the software to extend its application potential. Database,
graphical interface, and module interactions are integrated by the software. The
software is developed according to the requirements investigated in previous step. The
analysis and design is following the software development procedure A reference
manual describing procedures of using the software is documented.
12. Develop LTM Mathematical Model
Lateral transshipment strategies are developed in terms of influence factors identified
in the previous step. The mathematical model is then developed using the
transshipment strategies. Lateral transshipment mathematical model consists of two
parts: provider analysis and transshipment strategy.
13. Develop Policy Analysis Model
Optimum transshipment strategy for the supply chain system is analyzed using
computer simulation. The simulation is developed using eM-Plant software with
Simtalk™ language. Different sizes of supply chain systems are constructed in the
study. The research assumes a central warehouse periodically ship materials to
fabricators. Total cost, shortage amount, transshipment frequency, and inventory level
are analyzed through simulation.
19
This research is concluded from reviewing the study objectives with conducted
research results. The attained research contributions and the advantages of applying
the system are discussed. As well, directions are made for further advancements.

Finally, the report is prepared for informing the world of what has been done, what
has been discovered, and what has been drawn from the study. For systematic and
logical interpretation, the research report is written in an academic style and is divided

three types of buffers to absorb the impact of variability: inventory, capacity, and
time.
Pull production has become the feature of lean production (Spearman 2002a). Push
systems control release rates and measure WIP while pull systems control WIP and
measure output rates. Consequently, the feedback is much more frequent than in the
push system. The reason that pull works better than push is 1) it caps WIP and 2) it
has immediate feedback on the output rate. To achieve these two benefits, how much
WIP needed to keep bottleneck from starving and how to keep WIP at that level must
be determined.
Lean construction is a production management-based approach to project delivery
(Howell 1999). Applying lean concepts in the construction, buffer (inventory, time,
and capacity), WIP, and pulling are analyzed to promote the whole production system.
It extends the objectives of a lean production system - maximize value and minimize
waste.
2.2. Previous Studies in Precast Production Scheduling
Current scheduling practices in precast plants are basic and depend on planner’s
experience. Due to inaccurate planning methods, inefficient resource utilization and
overstocking are commonplace in the precast industry (Chan and Hu 2002, Dawood
and Neale 1993). Traditional precasters make production schedules using an
unsystematic manner, i.e. planners make production schedules according to their
experience and knowledge and arrange plans using a trial-and-error method (Ko and
Ballard 2004). In the recent years, several researchers have begun to invest methods
in order to improve precast production scheduling.
Dawood and Neale
23
Chan and Hu (2000, 2001, 2002a, 2002b) developed a flow shop sequencing model
optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In the model, constraints encountered in
practical industry were considered. The objective of the model is to find the sequence
of jobs minimizing the maximum flow time called makespan. An earliness penalty
function considering storage cost is used as part of objective function. The authors
compared the results derived using GAs and using heuristic rules. The proposed flow
shop sequencing model optimized by GAs can provide a family of solutions that at
least as good as those derived by heuristic rules. Due to the objective of minimizing
makespan, solutions derived by the model keep production systems busy. Besides,
inventory, batch size, plant capacity, and balance of work loading are ignored in their
research.
Leu and Hwang
Leu and Hwang (2000, 2001) took into account the impact of limited resources,
including equipment and skilled labor, on production makespan. A
resource-constrained mixed-production flow shop system was established by the
research. The system is driven by a GA to provide the optimal or near-optimal
combination of production sequences, resource utilization, and minimum makespan in
consideration of resource constraints and mixed production. The authors considered
limited resources, which is more realistic to the real world, promoting the precast
production scheduling one step ahead. However, the basic issue of inventory was
missing in the research. Also, due dates of products were not taken into account in the
research, which may yield wastes in the production system.

processed using Fuzzy Logic (FL) (Ko and Cheng 2003). Fuzzy logic was first
developed by Zadeh in 1960s for representing uncertain and imprecise information
(Zadeh 1965). In a wide sense, FL is synonymous with fuzzy set theory; that is, the
theory of classes with unclear boundaries. In a narrow sense, FL is a logic system that
is intended to serve as a logic of approximate reasoning (Zadeh 1994). Classical logic
(two-valued logic) assumes that every proposition is either true or false. This basic
assumption has been questioned. Unlike classical logic, FL is viewed as an extension
of multi-valued conventional logic. Everything in FL including truth is a matter of
degree (Song and Johns 1997).
Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) simulate the high level human decision making process,
which aims at modeling the imprecise modes of reasoning to make rational decisions
in an environment of uncertainty and imprecision. A general FLS contains four major
components: fuzzifier, inference engine, rule base, and defuzzifier, as shown in Figure
2-1 (Ko 2002).

global search. Also, because of its simplistic implementation procedure, the GA
provides a great flexibility to hybridize with domain-dependent heuristics to make an
effective implementation for specific problems. For these advantages, GAs have
received a considerable attention regarding their potential as a novel optimization
technique (Gen and Cheng 1997).
2.6. Object-Oriented Approach
Objects are the abstractions of physical and conceptual things that have relations,
attributes and behaviors. Object orientation is the concept that treats every physical
and conceptual thing as the objects (Booch 1994). In system development, the OO
approach views a system as a collection of interacting objects that work together to
accomplish tasks (Satzinger et al. 2000, Shelly et al. 2005).
The OO approach is an entirely different approach to traditional methods such as
structured approach and information engineering approach. It develops the software
applications in terms of component objects, classes of related objects, and frameworks
of related objects and classes. The characteristics of abstraction provide the OO
approach for addressing huge and complex problems. Since people tend to think about
the world in terms of object, the representations of abstraction and object in the
application domain furnishes a natural way for human communication. The OO
approach expresses systems using objects. Therefore, these objects can be used over
and over again whenever they are needed. In addition, the objects can be modified
without changing the entire system.
Software development is inherently complex. This inherent complexity derives from
the complexity of the problem domain, the difficulty of managing the development
process, the flexibility possible through software, and the problems of characterizing
31
iterative method delivers the whole system using several iterations. Each iteration
builds one portion of the system (incremental) on previous delivery. Since the method
accomplishes a portion of the whole system at a time and each development cycle
recovers software errors occurring in previous delivery, development risks and
complexity are reduced effectively (Rajlich 2006). This method also cuts down the
overall costs and the development time.

2.6.2. Unified Modeling Language (UML)
For communicating with system participants and modeling and documenting OO
software systems, proper notation is required in OO system development life cycle
(Willard 2007). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been adopted as a
standard OO specification language by the Object Management Group (OMG) for
specifying, visualizing, understanding, constructing, and documenting OO software
using OO concepts (Dai 2006). The OMG is a consortium that develops and
propagates uniformity in OO systems. The UML provides several robust models
including use case, class, object, component, deployment, sequence, collaboration,
statechart, and activity diagrams for users to describe applications for different
purposes (Booch et al. 1999). It has also received de facto approval by system
33
2.7.2. ERP Benefits
Benefits of adopting ERP are summarized as follows (Lin et al. 2006, Chia and Ling
2003, Sumner 2004, Zhang et al. 2005):
Provide better services for customers, up stream suppliers, and down stream
suppliers. ERP system that integrates internal information can immediately reflect
enterprise resources usage. For example, ERP monitors inventory level in the
company. The system can warn decision maker to reorder material when the
inventory level is low. As a result, lead time for delivery products can be controlled.
Customer’s satisfaction therefore can be achieved. An integrated system can also 
track level of Work-In-Process (WIP). As such, productivity can be understood. Up
stream and down stream relationships can be enhanced.
Improve effectiveness of process: BPR is frequently used while employing ERP.
BPR is a philosophy used to dramaticaly improve company’s performance 
(Hammer and Champy 2003). Business process is reviewed and system
requirements are rethought when developing the ERP. As a result, ineffective
activities and wastes are removed. In addition, BRP is driven by computer
technology that fastens communication and working process. Linkage between jobs
can be automatically connected through software.
Enhance information correctness and information sharing: One of the headaches to
effectively manage a company is how to deal with distributed data (Tinham 2005).
The same data have to be entered for couple of times if the company does not have
an integrated center. Rework, typos, and mistakes occur in the company. Unrelated
data also mislead employees for un-updated information. Through ERP, information
is integrated in a unified database. Unnecessary reworks and complexity of jobs are
removed by correct information and information sharing provided by ERP.

(R, S)
The (R, S) reorders amount of Q to reach inventory level S every R time
period, as shown in Figure 2-4. The method is frequently used when fabricators
have specific suppliers. Using the method can track trends of demand
correspondence with time. However, the method could increase order cost if R is
short. Beside, inventory shortage may occur before reorder.
37
The author makes construction material plans using inventory and supply
chain management theories. The study focuses on investigating combination of
suppliers for precast industry under uncertain demand, supply frequency, and
supply quantity. A minimum inventory model is developed in the study. However,
the research ignores extra cost and time for placing emergency orders to up
stream suppliers. In addition, the model only deals with steel material, which is
not sufficient for fabricators. The model executed under the environment of mass
production increases finished goods inventory, exposing fabricator under the

Jiang (2000) develops a supply chain model for premix concrete industry
based on research findings of International Group for Lean Construction (IGLC)
and Lean Construction Institute (LCI). The objective of the study is to enhance
product quality and services. By using computer simulation, factors effecting
premix concrete supply chain are analyzed. Improvement for premix industry is
discussed in the research.
Ko (2006)
To deliver products on time, precast fabricators start fabricating once they
receive design information. However, start fabricating as early as they receive
design information induces high inventory and exposures themselves under the
impact of variability. On the contrary, late fabrication reduces the possibility to be
impacted by variability and increases the possibility of late delivery. Ko (2006)
develops a Buffer Evaluation Model to evaluate demand induced by customers
(research phase I). A relative late fabrication due day is inferred by the model for
material planning.

Tagaras (1999)
Tagaras (1999) regarding emergency orders are paid for extra cost and time.
Therefore, the author proposes pooling policy between retailers. Retailers can
reduce shortage cost and inventory cost through sharing inventory resources.
Tagaras’s risk pooling assumes that all retailers use periodic ordering system and
the model has no emergency orders. As a result, retailers can only ask for help
from other retailers when they lack of inventory. Other retailers transship extra
inventory to who starve for materials. The policy is called lateral transshipment.
Using lateral transshipment, holding cost of retailer that have extra inventory as

or assumptions by developing abstract or physical models. It can be used to
explain system behavior so as to improve system efficiency. Although operation
research provides numerous quantification methods through mathematical models,
few of them can conform to situations encountered in real world. By the contrast,
simulation offers an economic and effective ways to experiment interactions
between factors (Eben-Chaime et al. 2004).
Simulation is regarded as an experimentation that understands complexity
with uncertainty. The tactic is to represent a real situation using a simplified
model. Simulation results can be used to infer complicated problems (Ingalls
2001). Computer simulation is divided into two stages namely modeling and
simulation. Modeling is constructing abstract concepts whereas simulation
represents the developed model using programming codes. Concept of computer
simulation is shown in Figure 2-7.

Figure 3-1 Strategy of Time Buffer Evaluation Model
3.2. Model Structure
The TBEM consists of two stages: erection duration inference and time buffer
adjustment, as illustrated in Figure 3-2 The duration of the construction is first
evaluated by using fuzzy logic. Then, a time buffer is estimated by considering the
tardiness penalty and crashing costs. Eventually, the production due dates for each
story can be determined by progressing backward from the highest level, story by
story, to the lowest level.

The output of the inference constitutes the erection duration. Five input variables,
namely lifting speed, site layout, wind speed, rainfall, and rainy days, influencing
erection progress are identified through interviews with experts. Those interviewed in
this study have more than 10 years’ experience in precast construction. The
membership functions of each input/output linguistic variable are determined by the
fabricators and the lifting crews, according to their experience and knowledge. The
distributions of the membership functions are graphed in Fig. 3-4. For example, the
lifting speed is defined using three fuzzy sets, i.e., slow, medium, and fast. These
membership functions are used in the fuzzifier component to calculate the degrees of
linguistic variables. Each input factor is explained as follows.

linguistic variable is normalized by the lower bound 0.2 (m/s) and the upper bound
7.6 (m/s), the factor being evaluated in accordance with weather forecasts and
historical data.
Precipitation
Rain impacts almost all kinds of construction operations (El-Rayes and Moselhi 2001).
Light rain has a minor impact; whereas, heavy rainfall interrupts erection progress.
Rainfall depth is also a seasonable variable which can be approximated from weather
forecasts (Ali 2000, Chen and Taylor 2002). The upper and lower bounds are
determined using historical data. These variables are normalized by 0 (mm) and 459
(mm), respectively. The value of this factor is input in accordance with weather
forecasts and historical data.
Consecutive rainy days
The number of consecutive rainy days plays a key role in evaluating construction
duration. If precipitation is concentrated into only a few days, construction cannot
proceed; however, the impact is limited if the precipitation is more widely distributed.
This variable ranges from 0 to 25 days, approximated according to weather forecasts
and historical data.
Erection duration
The output of the inference is erection duration which considers the aforementioned
factors. Five fuzzy sets are used to define this variable, the universe of discourse
being between 0 and 25 days.
3. Establish fuzzy rules
To formulate rules representing a practical status, fuzzy rules are established on the
basis of facts or human knowledge (Zadeh 1973). Fuzzy rules can generally be
generated by one of the following methods: 1) the manipulator’s behavior, 2) expert 
knowledge and experience, and 3) characteristics of the inference systems. This study

inventory; whereas, too little risks a loss in fabrication capacity. The objective of this
study is to evaluate a time buffer that provides an appropriate time cushion with less
inventory. The proposed method examines the tardiness penalty and crashing cost by
considering the late delivery scenarios established in this study. The cost of the
tardiness penalty for component ( teC ) of a story can be formulated as Eq. (3-2).

where iD represents the erection duration for the story, inferred using FL; tdC , the
cost of the tardiness penalty per day; and eN , the number of components in the story.
The crashing cost for a component ( ceC ), denoted in Eq. (3-3), includes fees accrued
to additional working hours, namely water fees ( wC ), electricity ( eC ), overtime
wages ( oC ), and material costs induced by shortening the lead time ( mC ), calculated
as follows:
moewce CCCCC  . (3-3)
According to Eq. (3-2), the cost of the tardiness penalty for a component ( teC )
decreases with the number of components ( eN ); whereas, the crashing cost for a
component ( ceC ) increases with the number of components required for overtime
work. Figure 3-6 graphs the trends in the curves. In this research, the intersection of
the tardiness penalty and the crashing cost curves is defined as the production
break-even point ( beN ). Prior to this point, the crashing cost is less expensive than the
tardiness penalty, meaning that once the fabricator becomes aware of failure to fulfill
the erection schedule, overtime work should be immediately launched since overtime
is more economical than the tardiness penalty. After the break-even point, overtime
work is still necessary, but the crashing cost is greater than the tardiness penalty. The
more the fabricator works, the more losses are incurred.
According to the aforementioned late-delivery scenario, the less expensive the

Production Scheduling Model
4.1 Precast Modeling
Precast production can be divided into six steps: (1) mold assembly, (2) placement of
reinforcement and all embedded parts, (3) concrete casting, (4) curing, (5) mold
stripping, and (6) product finishing, as depicted in Figure 4-1. The mold assembly
activity provides a specific dimension. In general, fabricators use steel molds for the
purpose of reuse. A precast component generally contains two kinds of materials, i.e.,
concrete and steel bars. Reinforcements and embedded parts are placed in their
positions after the mold is formed. Embedded parts are used to connect and fix with
other components or with the structure when the precast components are erected. The
concrete is cast when the embedded parts are in their positions. To enhance the
chemistry-solidifying concrete, steam curing is implemented; otherwise, the
component concrete requires weeks to reach its legal strength. Moving, erecting, or
erecting components before the legal strength is achieved may cause damage. The
molds can be stripped after the concrete solidifies. Due to the cost of developing steel
molds, fabricators reuse them once they are stripped. The final step in production is
finishing. Minor defects such as scratches, peel-offs, and uneven surfaces are treated
in this step.

where  ,j kC J M denotes the completion time for the jth element in k machine and
jkP is an operation time for that element ( 0jkP  ).
Eq. (4-1) assumes an infinite buffer size between stations so that the production flow
can be continuous. In practice, due to the large size of the precast elements, the buffer
size between stations is limited. The regular flowshop sequencing model derived in
Eq. (4-1) cannot meet the needs of precast production. This formula is therefore
reformulated as Eq. (4-2):
   1 1, 1, ax ( , ) , ( , ) +j k j k j k j k jkC J M M C J M WT C J M P    (4-2)
where 1,j kWT  is the time for the (j-1)th element in k machine waiting to be sent to
buffer, which can be represented by using Eq. (4-3):

In formula (3), kB is the buffer size between the k th and the ( 1k )th machines.
When the completion time of the kB th element at machine k is later than the
beginning time of machine ( 1k ), buffer size kB is not fully filled; otherwise, a
waiting time occurs. Buffer size kB is assigned by precast production schedulers
according to space conditions. Note that precast elements occupy a large space during
production.
Unlike the traditional flowshop sequencing problems, precast production features both
interruptible and uninterruptible activities. The interruptible ones can be interrupted if
the job cannot be completed within the working hours but can be continued by the
next working day. Uninterruptible activities cannot be interrupted until the job is
completed. Calculation of activity completion is illustrated in Figure 4-2. Precast
production activities including mold assembly, placement of reinforcement and all

frequently executed overnight. In this situation, the completion time is assumed to be
the beginning of the next working day (see situation II for steam curing in Figure 4-2).
The third situation is a lengthy which cannot be completed until the next working day
(see situation III for steam curing in Figure 4-2). The completion time of the jth
element in the curing process is formulated by Eq. (4-8):

4.2. Scheduling Evaluation Criteria
A decision maker faces challenges in achieving multi-objectives while devising
production schedules. Generally, the goal is to simultaneously minimize cost and
production duration. Scheduling performance is therefore evaluated by its makespan
and penalty costs (Caraffa et al. 2001). Makespan, also called maximum completion
time (C), denoting the period needed to complete all jobs, can be calculated by using
Eq. (4-11):
  1 max ,n mf C C J M   . (4-11)
Another index is the total costs of tardiness and earliness penalties. To achieve the
goal of delivering products Just-In-Time (JIT), the tardiness cost is considered
(Bulbul et al. 2004, Pathumnakul and Egbelu 2006). However, the inventory cost can
be decreased by considering the earliness penalty in production scheduling (Psarras
2007, Sawik 2007). The total penalty costs are computed as in Eq. (4-12):
    2

n n
j j j j j j
j j
f Max C d Max d C  
 
       (4-12)
where dj denotes the desired completion time for job j; j the unit cost of late
delivery for job j; and j, unit inventory cost for job j.
4. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms
4.1 Determining multi-objective function
This study evaluates production scheduling by its makespan and penalty costs. The
mathematical programming model used to minimize a multi-objective is shown in Eq.
(4-13):
61
in the first generation. By using Eq. (4-16), the objective function can be normalized
to a stable level.
4.3. Procedure for Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm
This research proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm to search for optimum
production schedules. The algorithm is developed on the basis of the schema of the
Multi-Objective Genetic Local Search (MOGLS) proposed by Ishibuchi and Murata
(1998). The evolutionary process of the developed algorithm is represented in Figure
4-4. Each step is discussed as below.

Figure 4-5 Encoding schema
Initializing population
A variation in an initial solution with higher fitness values can improve the searching
efficiency. To provide an equal opportunity for every state space, a set of initial
solutions is randomly generated. The chromosomes obtained provide a base for
further evolutionary processing.
Calculating objective function
In this step, the chromosomes corresponding with precast production model are
decoded. Moreover, Eq. (4-16) is used to calculate the objective value.
Updating Pareto solution
To be sure that the derived solutions conform to Pareto’s definition, every generation 
should be updated to this solution pool, a task accomplished by putting the
chromosomes conforming to the definition of this solution into the pool. Chrmosomes
in the pool which dissatisfy Pareto’s definition are removed. It should be noted that 
the size of the Pareto solution pool is unlimited.
Calculating fitness function
Eq. (4-14) and (4-15) are used to evaluate the fitness of each chromosome.
Selecting
A selection operator is used to choose chromosomes according to their fitness. A
chromosome with a higher fitness value has a greater chance for survival. The
purpose of this operator is to choose fitter chromosomes for evolving better
generations. This study adopts a roulette-wheel method for selection (Goldberg 1989)
instead of tournament method, since an elitism strategy is used. For population size
popN and elitism number eliteN , each generation selects  pop eliteN N chromosomes.

Figure 4-6 Schema of crossover operation
Mutating
The mutation operator produces spontaneous random changes in various
chromosomes and protects against premature loss of important notations. This study
uses shift mutation that randomly selects two points. The rear point is inserted ahead
of the front point; then, the entire string of genes behind the front point is again
shifted forward. The schema of the mutation is shown in Figure 4-7. Using this
method, the legality of production sequence can be remained.

Enhancing by elitism
Elitism has been proven successful in enhancing GA searches (Ko 2002), surviving a
certain number of Pareto solutions to the next generation. Thus, every generation
contains elite solutions for better evolution. By applying this strategy, the fitness
increases from one generation to the next.

Precast Enterprise Resources Planning
5.1. PrecastERP Development Process
An OO system development process, namely Unified Process (UP), is adopted
to develop PrecastERP. UP has been widely used as a standard method in software
engineering (Booch et al. 1999). It consists of four stages: inception, elaboration,
construction, and transition (as shown in Figure 5-1). Inception establishes the
business case for the project. Elaboration establishes a project plan and a sound
architecture. Construction grows the system. Transition supplies the system to its end
users.

UP is widely adopted since it accepts incremental and iterative process. Developing
incrementally means to refine systems in steps, whereas, iterative development
denotes to grow up systems with looping processes (Firesmith 1996). The schematic
diagram of the incremental and iterative method is shown in Figure 5-2. Unlike the

Lateral Transshipment Model
6.1. Supply Chain System
To enable fabricators to implement material transshipment, this study constructs a
supply chain framework. The established supply chain framework includes a central
warehouse with multiple fabricators, explained as follows:
1. Review policy
The system adopts a periodic review to monitor inventory level and chooses a method
for reducing review cost due to repetitive monitoring. Precast fabricators reorder
amount Q to reach inventory level S every time interval R (e.g. 30 days), as depicted
in Figure 6-1.

2. Transshipment policy
This study defines factories with sufficient inventory for others starved for materials
as providers and defines manufacturers starved for materials as receivers. Lateral
transshipment will not execute if receivers can replenish their inventory the next day.
As a result, materials are transshipped to other receivers eager for the material.
Transshipment terminates when all receivers have sufficient materials or all providers
cannot ship any materials.
83
This evaluation assumes that the precast fabricator’sdemand obeys a normal
distribution. To represent uncertain demands in a supply chain system, this method
uses two kinds of uniform distributions. A stable demand with low variability adopts
ii DD 333.0 , whereas an unstable one with high variability employs ii DD 667.0 .
6.2. Strategy Analysis Framework
6.2.1. Provider Analysis
The transshipment strategy analysis process includes two stages. The first stage
critiques whether a manufacturer has sufficient material for others. If any providers
exist, the process launches the second stage and analyzes an appropriate
transshipment strategy. Whether a manufacturer is qualified as a provider is estimated
by its demand from the current time point to the next review time point. If the current
inventory is sufficient for the interval, the retailer is qualified. Otherwise, providers
may become receivers after transshipment. A material shortage can be pre-warned
using Eq. (6-4):
  ,J,,jdtI jj 21for1)(  (6-4)
where )(tI j denotes inventory level of the manufacturer j at the time point t .
Equation (6-4) is used to pre-warn the manufacturer j that lacks materials one day
after the time point t . If Eq. (4) is true, the retailer needs transshipment. The amount
available for transshipment noted as )(tSH j is calculated using Eq. (6-5).
  jtIdtSH jjj  ,)(1)( . (6-5)
The next step evaluates whether a manufacturer is qualified as a provider. Equation
(6-6) is used to verify that the manufacturer has sufficient materials for future
demands.

shown in Figure 6-2). The fabricator’s future demand is approximated using its
average demand.

3. Lateral transshipments based on availability priority policy I (TBAPR I)
This strategy determines provider and receiver priority based on material sufficiency
and the shortage amount. Providers with the most sufficiency ship materials to those
with the most shortage to immediately replenish reserves, thereby reducing shortage
cost. The fabricator’s average demand estimates its future demand. Using Figure 6-3
as an example, horizontal lines denote the sufficiency and shortage levels for the
provider and receiver, respectively. Applying this strategy, manufacturer j , who has
most sufficiency, is determined to ship material to manufacturer z , who has the most
shortage. After the first shipment, manufacturer i becomes a new provider and
manufacturer y becomes a new receiver. The transshipment repeats until reaching
the termination condition.
The process is summarized as follows:
 Step 1: Material sufficiency is ranked from high to low
( )()()( ][]2[]1[ tAtAtA k  ), and material shortage is ranked from high to low
( )()()( ][]2[]1[ tSHtSHtSH k  ).
87
 Step 2: Calculate the shipment amount using Eq. (6-9).
 Step 3: Ship the material if receiver cannot replenish required materials by the
next day.
 Step 4: Return to step 1 if 0)()( ]1[]1[  tSHtA , otherwise terminate the
transshipment process.

5. Lateral Transshipments for Inventory Equalization policy (TIE)
This strategy enhances overall supply chain system efficiency. TIE determines the
fabricator’ssufficiency by considering the system demands and inventories. This
policy redistributes stocks to match the ratio of average demand for each retailer
whenever there are retailers with less than desirable stock levels. The TIE policy is
also a proactive policy based on the concept of inventory balancing or equalization
through stock redistribution. Equation 10 formulates the expected equalized inventory
level for manufacturer i for TIE. If actual inventory level for manufacturer i is more
than its expected equalized inventory level, manufacturer i becomes the provider.
On the contrary, manufactures are receivers if their actual inventory level is less than
the expected equalized level. After determining providers and receivers in the supply
chain system, TIE ships materials from providers with most sufficiency to those with
greatest shortage. The transshipment procedure is the same as TBAPR I.
89
present work considers external supply (from the original suppliers) besides the
transshipments to cover fabricators demand. The proposed supply chain framework
can also be applied to different precast fabrication materials (such as rebar, cement,
gravel, sand, pre-stressing cables, and tendons, etc.) simultaneously. Costs for
different materials can be represented using individual cost equation shown in Eq.
(6-12).

The precast components are assembled in sequence, i.e., columns, then major
and minor beams. In a crash, the production and construction sequences correspond.
The crashing cost can be evaluated by the weight of components. Among these, the
column is the heaviest followed by the major and minor beams. The throughput of the
studied factory is about 20 components per day. the number of steel molds for the
columns and the major and minor beams are 6, 16, and 20, respectively. When using
B1F as an example, at the beginning the crash, the factory primarily fabricates major
beams since B1F has no column. In one weekday, the factory can fabricate 16 major
and 4 minor beams. The 195 major and 52 minor beams require 13 production days
(totaling 260 components). Afterward, the factory primarily fabricates minor beams
having lighter weights and lower crashing costs. The total weights of the major and
minor beams are 2015 and 1077 tons, respectively. Moreover, crashing cost is US$7
per ton. Hence, the crashing cost is US$52 per component if production does not
exceed 260 components; whereas, this cost falls to US$32 per component when
production exceeds 260.
The production break-even point defined in this study can be obtained by
calculating the intersection of the tardiness penalty and crashing cost curves. The

7.2. Production Scheduling Experiments
This study validated the performance of the proposed Multi-Objective Precast
Production Scheduling Model (MOPPSM) through three experiments encompassing
five cases. The drawback when considering a single objective was examined first. In
97
Elite number: 1
Local search: disabled
Since it is merely a small problem, the local search was disabled. Execution times are
within 1 minute. The experimental results are shown in Table 7-8. In this table
MOPPSM1 denotes the proposed model with single-objective “makespan”; whereas,
MOPPSM2 denotes single-objective -“penalty costs.” By observing the table, the 
optimum schedule for single-objective makespan, [i.e., 4-6-2-6-1-3] was found by the
MOPPSM. The optimum schedule (i.e., 4-2-3-1-6-5) with a minimum penalty cost of
24.6 was also found in this study. The proposed model outperforms the Palmer, Gupta,
CDS and RA heuristics, as well as the EDD rule. The experiment validated the
assertion that the proposed model can be applied in single-objective precast
production scheduling situations such as emergency and high-penalty orders.
Generally, precast fabricators compile production schedules by considering the
multi-objectives discussed in the following sections.

The parameters used to test the expanded scheduling problem are summarized as
follows:
Population size: 70
Termination condition: 500 iterations
Crossover rate: 0.9
Mutation rate: 0.005
Elite number: 4
Local search: 2
The experimental results for the average of 20 runs are listed in Table 7-12, which
indicates that the table, spread and spacing of the CWGA are smaller than those of the
MOPPSM. The reason is that the CWGA concurrently searches for solutions along
with a fixed direction, thereby resulting a smaller searching space. Executions were
completed within 5 minutes. Moreover, the spreads of the VEGA and the MOPPSM
are similar; whereas, the spacing of the VEGA is larger than that of the MOPPSM
primarily because the VEGA selection operation depends on the individual fitness of
each objective. As a result, the Pareto solution obtained by the VEGA focuses on only
one of the objectives. According to the aforementioned experimental results and
analysis, the MOPPSM exceeds the VEGA and the CWGA in achieving the
multi-objectives, in terms of the Pareto front. This comparison is analyzed from the
searching technique perspective. The performance of the proposed MOPPSM in
precast production scheduling is validated in the following section.
103
The results indicate that the required buffer size for the precast production system is
two. Consequently, for cases 1 to 8 the buffer size has no impact on the makespan or
the penalty cost since the buffer size is larger than required. However, for cases 9 and
10 the buffer sizes are equal and smaller than required; moreover, both the makespan
and the penalty cost increases.
In practice, production scheduling involves more than 10 elements. To demonstrate
the real impact of the buffer size, the expanded production data shown in Table 7-11
are studied. The parameters of the MOPPSM are summarized as follows:
Population size: 70
Termination condition: 500 iterations
Crossover rate: 0.9
Mutation rate: 0.005
Elite number: 4
Local search: 2
The experimental results are displayed in Table 7-14, which indicates that the required
buffer size for the production system is 12. Thus, this experiment demonstrated that
buffer size plays a key role in precast production scheduling.

7.4. Lateral Transshipment Experiments
7.4.1. Design of Experiments
To verify feasibility of the developed transshipment policy analysis model, this work
used real cases with rebar material to test the model. The experiment considered four
factors i.e. demand variability, multi-manufacturer systems, order lead-time and costs
to approximate real world situations. Demand variability modeling used two normal
distributions. The first was high demand variability ( ii DD 667.0 ) and the second
was low demand variability ( ii DD 333.0 ). Experiments with three, five, and nine
manufacturer systems examined supply chain system size. Three combinations
corresponding to manufacturer systems represented order lead-time. For the three
manufacturers, the order lead times were 31L and 132 LL . For five
manufacturers, 321 LL and 1543  LLL . For the nine manufacturers system,
354321  LLLLL and 19876  LLLL . Total cost in this study included
holding, transportation and shortage costs. Holding cost was fixed as one per unit. The
shortage and transportation costs ( TRCSC, ) included five combinations: (4, 1), (9, 1),
(9, 3), (90, 10), and (20, 100). The simulation experimented with ninety combinations
( 3532  ) of situations. Table 1 illustrates the parameters used for the three
manufacturers.

The simulation implemented 300 times in 20-day periodic reviews for each multiple
manufacturer system. The simulation result trends for five and nine manufacturers
were similar to that for the three retailers’. This study therefore only demonstrated full
results for the three manufacturers. Table 2 shows the total costs average for the three
manufacturers. Tables 7-16 to 7-19 display the shortage amount, transshipment

Conclusions
An enhanced precast production system has been developed in this research to
improve current precast practices. Four models are provided for assisting production
managers. Each of them is addressed as follows.
8.1. Time buffer Evaluation Model
This report has elucidated the research on the development of the Time Buffer
Evaluation Model (TBEM) to deliver products on time while accumulating less
inventory. This model consists of two stages, i.e., erection duration inference and time
buffer adjustment. The erection duration was inferred using FL; whereas, the time
buffer was adjusted by considering the tardiness penalty and the crashing cost.
This study adopted a production strategy that finishes production later relative to
delivery dates to reduce both inventory and the impact of demand variability. To avoid
out-of-capacity fabrication due to a late production, this paper analyzed a time buffer
from a pessimistic perspective in a crashing scenario. The experiment results showed
that by adopting the proposed model, the level of finished goods inventory can be
reduced without changing the production resources. Fabricators can thus reduce the
risks of changes in delivery dates and manufacturing a product that is either not yet
needed or succumbs to design changes.
8.2. Production Scheduling Model
A Multi-Objective Precast Production Scheduling Model (MOPPSM) has been
developed in this study. The model consists of two stages. In the first, a mathematical
precast production model was developed. Production resources, mold type and
119
capacity as production constrains. The module can provide with a decision to set up
the capacity for long-term and short-term. PrecastERP functions are linked and
integrated using information technology including graphic user interface, relational
database, OO languages, software development process, and client/server architecture.
The whole system is driven by collaboration of various elements. The developed
PrecastERP integrates manufacturing resources required for production increasing
competitiveness for fabricators.
8.4. Lateral Transshipment Model
This study develops a framework for applying lateral transshipment to precast
construction and analyzes a central warehouse with multiple precast fabricators. To
eliminate imminent shortage, the developed framework transships materials from
fabricators with sufficient supplies to others starved for materials. This work develops
and analyzes six strategies considering uncertain demand, diverse order lead-time and
the scale of supply chain systems. Simulation results show that the TBAPR I strategy
induces minimum inventory and material shortage costs when implementing lateral
transshipment.
Previous studies in multi-echelon supply chains have highlighted that lateral
transshipment reduces both inventory and shortage costs. However, this study found
that lateral transshipment is not always beneficial in the construction industry where it
is more appropriate for fabricators located in nearby areas. Simulation results also
show that longer order lead-time increases total cost. For a larger multiple
manufacture supply chain system, a greater number of fabricators participating in the
corporate system enhances the amount of material shortages that can be reduced.
Current supply chain management in the precast industry focuses on promoting
individual benefits. Rare fabricators applying lateral transshipment strategies on

When analyze the lean design, use value stream mapping first.
Try to apply“pull”in lean design.
Some works have been done in target value design.
Process to implement this research:
 Measuring the waste of current design
 Refer some works about target value design
 Define the waste of design
 Design a new design paradigm
 Applying“pull”in design
The above process can be modified using lean thinking:
 Define value of the design
 Identify the waste using value streaming mapping
 Flow
 Pull
 Continuous improvement
