Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) is a technique to assess the spatial 
variation in absorption and scattering properties of the biological tissues and 
provides the monitoring of changes in concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin and 
deoxy-hemoglobin. In our preliminary study, the temporal tracings of 
hemodynamic oxygenation are measured with DOSI and venous occlusion test 
(VOT) from normal subjects, patients with heart failure and patients with sepsis in 
intensive care unit (ICU). In experiments, the obvious differences of hemodynamic 
signals can be observed among the three groups. The physiological relevance of 
VOT hemodynamics with respect to diseases is also discussed in this report. 
Keywords: diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging, diffuse optical tomography, 
intensive care unit, vessel occlusion test, hemodynamics
multiplexing and detected signals demultiplexing from photodiodes. All of the optical signals are 
analyzed based on the modified Beer-Lambert law with various source-detector separations on 
optode. 
Although the induced ischemia process (arterial occlusion test) provides information of 
local muscle energy metabolism [7,8], however, this process takes a risk for critical patients in 
ICU. Thus, the VOT was adopted to estimate muscle oxygen consumption and muscle blood flow 
by applying the same technique used in conventional venous plethysmography [9]. A controllable 
pneumatic tourniquet offers 50 mmHg on upper arm for venous occlusion and the optode of 
DOSI is placed on brachioradial muscle for extremity metabolic assessment based on optical 
detection. The clinical study was designed as a prospective case-controlled clinical investigation 
and informed consent was obtained from normal volunteers and waived for patients. In the 
preliminary study, two patients with sepsis and two patients with heart failure were measured in 
ICU. Two healthy volunteers were treated as control subjects. Generally, temporally applied low 
cuff pressures (50 mm Hg in our cases) occlude venous outflow while minimally obstructing 
arterial outflow. The increase in deoxygenated blood is then used to calculate muscle oxygenation 
[10].  Near-infrared spectroscopy determined assessments of tissue oxygenation by VOT have 
been shown to agree with traditional measurements using plethysmography and the Fick method 
[11]. The traditional measures cannot provide localized detections on muscle tissue, however, 
DOSI offers an ability to access the spatial distribution of tissue oxygenation in real-time [12]. 
Subjects were placed in a quiet environment while resting in a semi-recumbent position and no 
movement was allowed during the optical measurements with VOT. An initial manual blood 
pressure assessment was taken on the same arm to define baseline perfusion pressure using a 
sphygmomanometer. The sphygmomanometer was then placed on the forearm above the probe to 
minimize both discomfort during VOT and total vascular space from which blood volume 
redistribution might occur [13]. During the DOSI measurement, several physiological parameters 
(heart rate, respiratory rate, FiO2, SpO2, etc.) were monitored for safety (shown in Table 1).

In our DOSI system, all detected signals are analyzed based on the modified Beer-Lambert 
law for two-dimensional image mapping with respect to source-detector geometry. The 
reconstructed values that correspond to the sensing region of optode are calculated with the data 
measured by nearest-neighbor source-detector pairs. For characterizing of hemodynamic signals,

The hemodynamic tracings during VOT from septic patients are provided in Fig. 4. The 
curves show slow increasing of THb and Hb and slow decreasing HbO2 and StO2. Sepsis is 
considered a disease of the microcirculation and then induces microvascular dysfunction.  
Because the microcirculatory derangements of sepsis cause vascular density are decreased, the 
hemodynamic signal changes with slow gradient implies the vessels are intermittently perfused. 
Thus, the experimental results imply faulty autoregulation of local blood flow. 
 
Fig. 4 Temporal tracings of the VOT response of septic patients. 
 For qualitative comparison, the highest amplitude of hemodynamic change occurs at the 
beginning of VOT in healthy subjects, especially in change of oxy-hemoglobin concentration. 
Besides, the increasing patterns of deoxy-hemoglobin concentration are quite different in the 
three groups. As mention before, different patterns reveal the different physiological conditions in 
subjects. On the other hand, the recovery time of total hemoglobin is much longest in septic 
patients. Although the preliminary study measured the hemodynamic signals during VOT with 
few of subjects, the results indicate high feasibility of clinical diagnosis based on DOSI method 
in ICU. We are going to collect and analyze more clinical data for the further understanding.

This proposal is to request support for the investigation of diffuse optical tomography technique 
and it’s clinical applications. Two main objectives are: (1) to develop an optical imaging system 
based on diffuse optics and (2) to optimize the optode scheme and reconstruction algorithm for 
clinical applications. As the report given above, we have developed a continuous-wave diffuse 
optical spectroscopic imaging system with dual-wavelength optode. Besides, the binarize 
segmentation method was adopted for enhancement of hemodynamic signal in experiments. The 
preliminary result indicates the feasibility for ICU monitoring with successful in VOT 
measurement of sepsis and heart failure patients. Therefore, the goals of research plan are almost 
reached. However, because of the budget limit, the issue about the tissue characterization with 
time-resolved polarization-gating method that was described in original proposal has not been 
applied in current stage.
