The first example relates to the subwavelength imaging using an array of silver nanorods, 
as reported in [2]. The left panel of Fig. 1 is Fig. 1 of [2], which shows the nanorod-array 
structure and the FDTD simulation results of the image profiles at different places due to 
point sources shaped as the letter “λ” as an object. The rod height is 50 nm, the rod diameter 
is 20 nm, and the side-to-side distance between the rods is 40 nm. The right panel of Fig. 1 
shows our 3-D FDTD simulation results corresponding to (f) and (g) places in the left panel. 
Our FDTD is with the Drude dispersion model and good agreement with {2} is seen. Fig. 2(a) 
is from Fig. 2 of [2], showing the light intensity distribution along one rod, and the blue line 
in Fig. 2(b) is our calculation. Again, excellent agreement with [2] is observed.

method based on a multidomain pseudospectral method has been proposed for calculating the 
band diagrams of 2-D PCs and is shown to possess excellent numerical convergence behavior 
and accuracy [8]. The proposed method shows uniformly excellent convergence 
characteristics for both the transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic waves in the analysis 
of different structures. The analysis of a mini band gap is also shown to demonstrate the 
extremely high accuracy of the proposed method. The first page of the paper published in 
Physical Review E [8] is attached as Appendix III.  
In the development of the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) simulation method, the 
Drude dispersion model has been incorporated into the code for treating problems involving 
metallic materials in the optical frequency domain. In related work, optical properties of a 
metallic sphere based on the classical Drude model have been studied theoretically. The 
comparison between the metallic sphere and the perfectly conducting one shows conspicuous 
distinction in the electric field amplitude on the surface of the sphere and in the radar cross 
section behavior [9]. Please refer to Appendix IV [9]. 
 
IV. Analysis and Investigation of Photonic Crystal Fibers and Special-type Optical 
Waveguides 
 The FDFD waveguide eigenmode solver based on the Yee mesh [4] is a versatile 
method for the analysis of different optical waveguides. We have used it to study the 
propagation characteristics and chromatic dispersion coefficients of photonic crystal fibers 
[10]–[12]. We have recently applied the FDFD solver to investigate modal properties of 
guided modes on air-core terahertz waveguides with the air core surrounded by Teflon rods. 
The antiresonant reflection optical waveguide (ARROW) model was successfully adopted to 
explain the guiding behavior [13]. Please refer to Appendix V [13]. Based on such FDFD 
analysis, we have proposed a very simple procedure for numerical calculation of chromatic 
dispersion coefficients of photonic crystal fibers, which involves Chebyshev-Lagrange 
interpolation polynomials [14]. No direct numerical differentiation of the effective refractive 
index is needed. Please refer to Appendix VI [14].

Abstract --- We adopt the finite-difference frequency-domain method to determine the 3D photonic crystal 
band structures. The band diagrams of two different kinds of structures are efficiently obtained with good 
agreement with results from other methods. 
Keywords: Finite-difference frequency-domain method, photonic band gap, photonic crystals. 
INTRODUCTION 
Photonic crystals (PCs) have many applications, including the routing and guiding of light in all three 
dimensions, due to the photonic band gaps (PBGs) resulting from periodic structures [1]. A simple cubic (sc) 
lattice structure is symmetrical with respect to x, y, and z directions and therefore is the most natural platform for 
constructing photonic crystal devices [2]. Besides, theoretical investigation suggests that it is possible to create 
such an sc structure with a complete PBG [3]. In this paper, we develop a finite-difference frequency-domain 
(FDFD) method based on the Yee mesh to calculate the band diagrams of three-dimensional (3D) PCs. 
Two-dimensional version of the FDFD method has been used to calculate the band structures of 2D PCs [4]. We 
will consider two kinds of 3D structures. The first one is dielectric spheres in air, and the second is scaffold 
structures, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The band diagrams of these two structures are obtained 
and compared with other numerical methods and experimental results.

NUMERICAL METHOD 
Since 3D PCs are periodic along three orthogonal directions, the propagation in all directions must be 
taken into account, i.e., the three phase constants kx, ky, and kz may all have non-zero values. Starting from 
Maxwell’s curl equations and using the central difference scheme with 3D Yee’s mesh shown in Fig. 1(c), we 
can obtain the following six equations with six electromagnetic components as

We proceed further to consider a more complex 3D PC structure: the scaffold PC which consists of layers 
of interconnected square rods joined by vertical posts to form a sc lattice. The reciprocal lattice of the scaffold 
structure is the same as the inset of Fig 2(b). The unit cell of the scaffold structure is shown in Fig. 3(a), and the 
width of the square rod is w = 0.13950a. The dielectric filling fraction is 19% and the refractive index of 
dielectric materials is n = 3.6. By applying the FDFD method with 16×16×16 grid points in the unit cell and the 
index averaging scheme for the permittivity at each grid point, the band diagram of this structure can then be 
obtained as the dashed lines as shown in Fig. 3(b). The triangular dots in Fig. 3(b) are from the 
plane-wave-expansion (PWE) method [6], and the dots are from experimental results [2].

The lowest six bands are presented in Fig. 3(b) with bands 1 and 2 being the photonic valence bands (VBs), 
and bands 3 to 6 being the photonic conduction bands (CBs). One can see a complete band gap in Fig. 3(b), 
which is defined by the VB maximum at the R point and the CB minimum at the X point. The lower bound of 
the band gap is ω1 = 0.367, and the upper bound is ω2 = 0.390. In our numerical calculation, there is a visible 
difference between our results and those of [6] if the discontinuity of dielectric interfaces is not taken into 
account. By adopting the index averaging scheme, our results match well with those obtained by the PWE 
method [6], as shown in Fig. 3(b). Besides, from Fig. 3(b), it is seen that both our FDFD results and those of the 
PWE method are close to the trend of the dots from experimental results [2] at the X-M region in the VB region. 
CONCLUSION 
We have demonstrated that the FDFD method can be efficiently utilized to calculate the band diagrams of 
3D PC structures. We have considered two structures: the dielectric spheres in air and the scaffold structure. 
When the index averaging scheme is used, the obtained band diagrams agree well with those calculated by the 
plane-wave-based TMM and the PWE method. The established FDFD method can treat PCs with diagonal 
permittivity tensor.

cross-section of this 2D PC, where the cylinder rod of radius r = 0.5a is the region with the nematic LC,
where a is the period of the lattice. The nematic LC is a homogenous uniaxial LC having the ordinary

of the square lattice is shown in Fig. 1(b). With the existence of anisotropic materials, the symmetry

of the first BZ. Figure 2 presents the band structure for the PC with α = 45◦ for the H wave. This result

An analysis method based on a multidomain pseudospectral method is proposed for calculating the band
diagrams of two-dimensional photonic crystals and is shown to possess excellent numerical convergence
behavior and accuracy. The proposed scheme utilizes the multidomain Chebyshev collocation method. By
applying Chebyshev-Lagrange interpolating polynomials to the approximation of spatial derivatives at collo-
cation points, the Helmholtz equation is converted into a matrix eigenvalue equation which is then solved for
the eigenfrequencies by the shift inverse power method. Suitable multidomain division of the computational
domain is performed to deal with general curved interfaces of the permittivity profile, and field continuity
conditions are carefully imposed across the dielectric interfaces. The proposed method shows uniformly ex-
cellent convergence characteristics for both the transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic waves in the analy-
sis of different structures. The analysis of a mini band gap is also shown to demonstrate the extremely high
accuracy of the proposed method.

I. INTRODUCTION
Band structures are essential characteristics of photonic
crystals PCs, from which possible photonic band gaps
PBGs can be identified 1–3. For frequencies within the
PBGs, wave propagation is forbidden and many photonic
devices have been proposed and designed based on this phe-
nomenon. In particular, two-dimensional 2D PCs com-
posed of either dielectric rods or air columns have been
widely employed in many applications such as waveguiding,
resonant cavity formation, and wavelength filtering. In this
paper, we propose an analysis scheme with excellent numeri-
cal convergence behavior and accuracy for calculating the
band structures of 2D PCs. The currently most used numeri-
cal methods for such calculations have been the plane-wave
expansion PWE method 3–6 and the finite-difference
time-domain FDTD method 7,8. The finite-difference ei-
genvalue problem formulation has also been employed by
Yang 9 and Shen et al. 10, and more recently by Yu and
Chang 11 based on the Yee mesh as often employed in the
FDTD method 12. The Yee-mesh-based formulation was
named the finite-difference frequency-domain FDFD
method. Yu and Chang 11 used the FDFD method to ana-
lyze the band structures of 2D PCs with either square or
triangular lattices and adopted a fourth-order accurate com-
pact finite-difference scheme 13 to increase numerical effi-
ciency and accuracy. Although the FDFD method offers re-
sults with accuracy comparable to those obtained using the
MIT photonic-bands MPB package 14 based on the PWE
method, the numerical convergent speed was found not to be
uniformly fast among different bands in the two methods.
The numerical formulation proposed in this paper is based
on the multidomain pseudospectral method using Chebyshev
polynomials. The pseudospectral method has recently at-
tracted raised attention as an alternative treatment for com-
putational electromagnetics because of its high-order accu-
racy and fast convergence behavior over traditional
techniques while retaining formulation simplicity. It has a
long history of being applied to fluid dynamics 15 and has
recently been extended to the analysis of electromagnetics
both in the time 16–18 and in the frequency domain 19.
However, while the theory of the pseudospectral method has
been well elaborated, the application in the frequency do-
main has not received much focus compared with that in the
time domain in the electromagnetics community. In 19, the
pseudospectral frequency-domain method was proposed and
applied to solve the nonhomogeneous nonzero-source
Helmholtz equation in a simple two-subdomain problem
with rectangular structure shape. Our proposed scheme in
this paper utilizes the multidomain Chebyshev collocation
method supported by the curvilinear mapping technique 20
to facilitate and ameliorate the simulation of 2D PCs of ar-
bitrary permittivity profile. The formulation is derived in the
form of an eigenvalue problem so that we can readily obtain
the eigenmodes by available mathematical tools. Here, we
adopt the shift inverse power method SIPM for its particu-
larly fast convergence characteristic over other conventional
methods applying matrix inversion. Both the multidomain
pseudospectral algorithm and the SIPM furnish our pseu-
dospectral mode solver PSMS as a quite powerful and flex-
ible method. To obtain high-accuracy full-vectorial modal
solutions for dielectric structures, proper satisfaction of di-
electric interface conditions is essential, whether it is based
on the finite-difference method 21,22, the finite-element
method 23, or others. Such proper treatment of interface
conditions will be carefully considered in our formulation.
The rest of this paper is outlined as follows. The physical
problem involving the Helmholtz equations is described in
Sec. II along with the required Dirichlet and Neumann type
boundary conditions across the dielectric interfaces. The for-
mulation of the PSMS is presented in Sec. III. Numerical
examples including 2D PCs with either a square or a trian-*Electronic address: hcchang@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw

the perfectly conducting one for most of the wavelengths. In particular, for 0.3 ~ 0.4 μmλ = , 
the differences are more significant. In both cases, the amplitude reaches the highest 
for 0.36 μmλ : , partly due to the minimum in the imaginary part shown in Fig. 2(a). The highest 
values represented by the experimental data are about 7 and 19, respectively. The results show 
that the size of the sphere will affect the amplitude of the electric field and that for the metallic 
sphere is larger than that of the perfectly conducting one.

Abstract:  The finite-difference frequency-domain method is adopted for the analysis of air-core 
THz waveguides formed by Teflon rods. The guiding mechanism is found to be based on the 
ARROW model. The calculated propagation characteristics demonstrate that well confined THz 
guided field can be obtained.

1. Introduction 
In most terahertz (THz) systems, the propagation of far infrared electromagnetic waves relies on traditional metal or 
dielectric waveguides which suffer from high conductivity losses or dielectric losses and consequently have 
limitation for practical applications. Thus, it is a great issue to develop effective and low-loss waveguiding 
structures for THz signals for a compact, reliable, and flexible THz system. One possible way is to use metal-based 
Sommerfeld wires to confine THz signals with low fraction of power within lossy dielectric materials to reduce the 
attenuation caused by materials [1]. However, the transmission of THz signals on Sommerfeld wires suffers from a 
large field extension into air and large radiation loss at waveguide bending. Another approach utilizes total internal 
reflection (TIR) to guide THz signals in small air region formed by dielectric materials [2]. Good confinement of 
THz signals can be observed in the small air gap but with unignorable amount of field in the thick dielectric layers, 
which might result in high transmission loss in the materials in THz frequency range.  
In this paper we consider air-core waveguides formed by polytetrafluorethylene (Teflon) rods for THz 
waveguiding. Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show two examples of such waveguides with the air core surrounded by variant 
numbers of Teflon rods. The propagation characteristics of the waveguides with various rod-sizes and distributions 
are calculated by applying a full-vectorial finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method [3]. The performance 
of these THz waveguides is discussed based on the calculated propagation characteristics.

2. The numerical method 
The FDFD method which is an efficient and accurate numerical model for optical waveguide analysis [3] is utilized 
to analyze air-core waveguides in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Consider the time-harmonic Maxwell's curl equations 
HjE 0ωμ−=×∇  and EjH rεε 0ω=×∇  where ω is the angular frequency, μ0 and ε0 are the permittivity and the 
permeability of free space, respectively, and εr is the relative permittivity of the dielectric medium. By discretizing 
the transverse (x-y) plane using the Yee’s mesh as shown in Fig. 1(c) and applying the central difference scheme for 
the differential operators, the curl equations can be converted into the matrix form [3] 
positions of discontinuities are almost the same for both arrangements. Besides, the propagation-loss results given in 
Fig. 3(b) also show similar distributions for 8 and 12 rods with the peaks appearing at similar locations.

Now we keep the size of the air core the same and change the diameter of the Teflon rods. Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) 
show the modal indices and propagation losses, respectively, for 8 teflon rods with d = 1.2 mm and 1.6 mm. One can 
see that the discontinuities in modal dispersion curves and the positions of the propagation-loss peaks have obvious 
differences between the two sizes. This is because the resonant frequencies highly dependent on the size of the 
surrounding rods and so do the propagation characteristics. If the sizes of the Teflon rods are kept the same, the 
number of rods will not affect the resonant frequencies, making the air-core waveguides possess similar propagation 
characteristics as shown in Fig. 3. Practically, these rods need an inner or outer shell to be connected to realize a 
workable structure, which might influence the propagation properties and is worth further discussions.

4. Conclusions 
We have investigated modal properties of guided modes on air-core THz waveguides with the air core surrounded 
by Teflon rods. The guided modes can be found over almost the frequency range concerned and the ARROW model 
is successfully adopted to explain the discontinuities of the modal index curves where the propagation losses 
become relatively huge. It is also observed that the propagation characteristics of the air-core waveguides are highly 
dependent on the size of surrounding rods and the number of rod has little influence on the performance of these 
waveguides.

the prime denotes the derivative. One merit to employ the
Chebyshev polynomial is the available analytical formula for
its collocation points, which is given by xi = cos(iπ/N),
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N . The CCM provides an N th-order approx-
imation of f(x) as (LNf)(x) =
∑N
i=0 f(xi)gi(x), where the
Chebyshev–Lagrange interpolation polynomials are given by
gi(x) = [(1− x2)T ′N (x)(−1)i+1]/[ciN2(x− xi)] with c0 =
cN = 2, and ci = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. The polynomials gi(x)
have the properties that gi(xj) = 1 for i = j and gi(xj) = 0
for i = j. Therefore, (LNf)(xi) = f(xi) and the derivatives
of f(x) at a collocation point xi can be computed by a ma-
trix operator, with the matrix entries Dij = g′j(xi), through
df(xi)/dx =
∑N
j=0 g
′
j(xi)f(xj) =
∑N
j=0Dijf(xj). The ex-
plicit expressions for Dij , as given in [11], are Dij =
(ci/cj)[(−1)i+j/(xi − xj)] for i = j, i, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N ,
Dii=−xi/[2(1−x2i )] for 1 ≤ i ≤ N−1, D00 = (2N2+ 1)/6,
and DNN = −(2N2 + 1)/6. The matrix with elements Dij
is termed the differential matrix and will be denoted as D¯ in
the following. In summary, in the CCM, the function f(x)
is approximated by a summation of N + 1 terms involving
N + 1 known continuous interpolating functions gi(x), and the
numerical derivative of f(x) is easily evaluated in terms of the
known derivative values of gi(x).
III. IDEALISTIC WAVEGUIDE HAVING ANALYTICAL
CHROMATIC DISPERSION CHARACTERISTICS
We describe in this section our proposed method and ex-
amine its accuracy in calculating chromatic dispersion coef-
ficient curves by referring to some analytical results of an
idealistic waveguide, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. It is a
silica-material-filled metallic rectangular waveguide with side
widths a = 5.28 µm and b = 4.13 µm. The waveguide is
assumed to be enclosed by perfect electric conductor (PEC)
walls. From the theory of metallic waveguide [12], the prop-
agation constant of the fundamental TE10 mode has the ex-
pression β = [k20ε− (π/a)2]1/2 = neﬀk0, or we have neﬀ =
[ε− (λ/2a)2]1/2, where k0 is the wavenumber in free space,
and ε is the relative permittivity of silica. Even when taking
into account the material dispersion of silica described by the
four-term Sellmeier formulas [13], [14] for ε as a function of
λ, the derivatives of neﬀ with respect to λ can be analytically

with the Sellmeier coefficients [13], [14] given in Table I. The
exact analytical result is shown in Fig. 1 as the solid line for
wavelength varying from 0.6 to 1.5 µm.
To apply the CCM, we first do a linear coordinate transforma-
tion by mapping the domain λ1 ≤ λ ≤ λ2 to the domain −1 ≤
x ≤ 1 of the x-axis. By employing Chebyshev polynomial of
degree N = 12, we have 13 Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto points
in the domain −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and the corresponding ones in the
wavelength domain λ1 ≤ λ ≤ λ2. We calculate neﬀ of the
fundamental core mode of the rectangular waveguide of Fig. 1
at these 13 wavelengths and use these 13 numbers to construct
a 13 × 1 column vector [neﬀ ]. The mode solver we use is
that based on the finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD)
method [15]. Then, the D values to be determined at these 13
wavelengths are taken to be the entries of the 13 × 1 vector [D].
It is easy to obtain the following relationship using the simple
chain rule given as follows:
[D] = − (4λ/c(λ2 − λ1)2) D¯D¯[neﬀ ]. (6)
Therefore, once the vector [neﬀ ] is known, the vector [D]
can be obtained readily, and no numerical differentiation is
needed. The 13 circles in Fig. 1 show such results, and it
is seen that they agree with the analytical solution. In fact,

the three-ring holey fiber of Fig. 2(a), with Λ = 2.3 µm and d/Λ = 0.6

by Kuhlmey et al. [5].
cross section of the three-ring holey fiber is shown in Fig. 2(a).
The parameters considered are Λ = 2.3 µm and d/Λ = 0.6,
where d is the diameter of each air hole. Again, we employ
our Yee-mesh-based FDFD waveguide eigenmode solver [15]
using the grid size ∆x = ∆y = ∆ = 0.1 µm to calculate neﬀ
at 13 wavelengths from λ = 0.6 to 1.7 µm, corresponding to the
Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto points for N = 12. The material
dispersion of silica has been taken into account by using the
four-term Sellmeier formulas [13], [14]. Then, the D curve is
determined using the CCM as in Section III. TheD values at the
13 collocation points are presented as the circles in Fig. 3 with
the solid line being that shown in [5, Fig. 3]. The agreement is
obviously very good. If we plot our calculated continuous curve
for D in Fig. 3, it would, again, be indistinguishable from the
solid line. We have also considered N = 8, 6, and 4, and the
three continuous curves are plotted in Fig. 3. Again, N = 4 is
not enough for obtaining correct curve. As N is increased, the
results converge with the maximum errors occurring near the
two ends. This is the characteristic of the Chebyshev spectral
method. It can be seen that there exist some noticeable differ-
ences at the two ends between the N = 8 and N = 12 lines.
This example demonstrates a general feature that a suitable
value of degree N can be determined by examining the numeri-
cal convergence at the ends of the wavelength domain. As long
as the difference between the results for degrees N − 1 and N ,
respectively, at the ends is small enough for specific application,
the whole curve of degree N will surely be acceptable.
In our FDFD eigenmode solver, as discussed in [15], we have
two schemes in treating the dielectric interface problem, that
is, the interface between silica and air, namely 1) the simple
staircase approximation and 2) the more elaborative boundary
condition (BC) matching method. The latter has been shown to
be much more accurate than the former. We have analyzed the
structure of Fig. 3 using both schemes, and the results are given
in Table IV. It can be observed that although the neﬀ values
of the staircase scheme agree with those of the BC matching
scheme only up to three digits after the decimal point, the
difference in D results is at most 0.64%, which occurs near
λ = 1.7 µm. Again, this demonstrates the robustness of the
proposed method for calculating D.
We then consider a six-ring holey fiber recently analyzed
by Saitoh and Koshiba using the finite element method

(FEM) [16], with the cross section as shown in Fig. 2(b). In
[16, Fig. 16(a)], six D curves of the lowest core mode were
plotted for d/Λ = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, respectively,
and Λ = 1.0 µm. We employ the FDFD eigenmode solver [15]
using the grid size ∆x = ∆y = ∆ = 0.067 µm and the CCM
with N = 12 to obtain the corresponding results and plot them
as the five lines in Fig. 4. These five lines agree well with those
in [16, Fig. 16(a)]. The circles are sample points extracted from
the results of [16].
In the numerical examples presented so far, as in most sit-
uations in the holey-fiber study, the dispersion variations were
seen to vary by over hundreds of picoseconds per nanometer
kilometer within the interested wavelength range. We finally
consider an extreme situation in which the holey fiber is de-
signed to possess nearly zero dispersion-flattened characteris-
tics. One such structure was demonstrated in [16], with the
cross section as shown in Fig. 5 and the dispersion designed
to remain between 0.1 and 0.3 ps/(nm · km) for the wavelength
range from 1.41 to 1.68 µm. The structure parameters of this
ten-air-hole-ring holey fiber were Λ = 1.6 µm, d1 = 0.47 µm,
d2 = 0.71 µm, d3 = 0.74 µm, d4 = 0.62 µm, and d5 = · · · =
d10 = 0.65 µm, where di is the air-hole diameter of the
ith air-hole ring. For this structure, we have found that the
numerical accuracy in the calculation of neﬀ is quite critical
in determining the D curve. As shown in Fig. 6, the dots are
