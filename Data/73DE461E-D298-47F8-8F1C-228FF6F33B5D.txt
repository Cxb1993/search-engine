but metal salts are generally soluble in water.  Therefore, a surfactant with hydrophilic CO2-philic structure has been 
applied to form microemulsion of CO2 in water (C/W) [14].  Recently, the novel method of electroplating in emulsion 
of SCCO2 and electroplating solution has been developed with some advantages, including fine grains, reducing 
pinholes, uniformity, and increasing hardness [15,16].  Hence, the purpose of this study is to produce nickel nano-wire 
arrays in AAO template by electroplating under an emulsion of SCCO2 and electrodeposition solution.   
 
2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
Materials 
Nonionic type of surfactant, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether H(CH2CH2O)8O(CH2)12H purchased from 
Fluka., was employed to increase the dissolution rate between supercritical CO2 and electrolyte solution. The 
electrodeposition solution consisting of 240 g/L nickel sufate (NiSO4·6H2O), 45 g/L nickel chloride (NiCl2·6H2O), and 
30 g/L boric acid (H3BO3) at pH 4.8 and 50 ?is usually called Watt bath.  Carbon dioxide with minimum purity of 
99.9% was purchased from SanFu Gas Co. Ltd.  All other chemicals were purchased from Showa. The anode was a 
nickel plate size 50x25 mm2 and the cathode was the prepared 
AAO template. 
Preparation of AAO template  
The anodic aluminum oxide template was prepared the 
two-step anodization procedure. First, pure Al (99.7%) foil 
was annealed at 400 °C for 0.5 hours under a N2 mixed 
with 1% H2 atmosphere to promote the grain growth of 
polycrystalline Al.  Anodization was operated in 0.3 M 
oxalic acid solution of 20 °C at 40 V for 1hr. Subsequently, the 
oxide layer was removed for 3 hrs in a mixture of phosphoric 
acid (6wt%) and chromic acid (1.5wt%) at 60 °C. After 
removal of the oxide layer, the aluminum was anodized again 
at the same cell potential as used during the first anodizing 
step and lasted until the Al was completely converted 
to AAO.  Pore widening was carried out in 5wt% phosphoric 
acid at room temperature for 30 min. 
Experimental apparatus and method 
A high-pressure experimental system for 
electrochemical deposition of nickel nano-wire arrays was 
shown in Fig. 1. The reaction cell made of stainless steel 316 
vessel has a volume of 550 mL outside with a temperature 
heating jacket.  A hot plate with magnetic stirrer was placed underneath the reactor to maintain temperature and 
stirring.  Both the anode and cathode were attached using platinum wires to the reactor and were connected with 
programmable power supply HP6613C manufactured by Hewlett Packard.  A typical electrodeposition reaction was 
performed in a constantly agitated ternary system of dense CO2, the electrodeposition solution and the surfactant.  The 
nickel electrodeposition solution and the surfactant were both placed in the high-pressure vessel.  SCCO2 was 
introduced to the high-pressure vessel using a syringe pump.  The ternary system was then constantly agitated at a 
speed of 400 rpm under 50 ?.  The nanopores are filled with nickel under constant current conditions (0.28 ASD) 
adopting the concept of electrodeposition. The diameter of the nickel nanowire was monitored by FE-SEM (LEO 
1530).  
 
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
During the anodization process, the pores nucleate on the surface at almost random positions, and as a result 
pores on the surface occur randomly and have a broad size distribution. Second anodization was conducted after

78.6o.  These diffraction peaks of Ni nanowires were also observed closed to 2θ= 44.6o, 52.2o and 76.6o corresponding 
to (110), (200) and (220) plane.  Comparison the electroplating under different pressures, the strong peak at 2θ= 52.2o 
(at ambient) shifted to 2θ= 44.6o (at supercritical condition).  Fig. 9 shows XRD spectrum of the Ni film on the copper 
plate under supercritical condition.  The peaks of Ni film were similar to the spectrum in the Fig.7.  The reason for 
the diffraction peaks shifting derived from most of Ni deposited into the AAO template.  In Fig. 8, the broad peaks of 
Ni nanowires were attributed to smaller grain size.  The results also reported in the literatures.   It pointed the Ni 
atoms nucleate grew into channel of AAO in supercritical CO2 were easier than they in atmospheric pressure.  The 
filling into the pores of AAO when Ni deposited under supercritical condition is better than at ambient.  Fig.10 
showed the SEM image of Ni nanopillars by removing from AAO.  The nanopillars were fabricated by electroplating 
at ambient.  There are some empties clearly showed on the film. Through the date of the measured XRD spectrum and 
calculated by the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of the nickel nano-wire decreases from 21 nm to 11 nm with 
pressure increasing from ambient to 20.4 MPa, as shown in Fig 11.
