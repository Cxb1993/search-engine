Abstract 
 
In this study, a new technique is 
proposed for measuring the principal axis 
angle, retardance and rotation angle of 
optical samples. A rotating-wave-plate 
Stokes polarimeter is used to extract the 
2x2 central elements of the Mueller matrix 
of the sample via two probe lights linearly 
polarized at angles of 0 and 45 degrees, 
respectively. The validity of the method is 
demonstrated using a half-wave plate 
positioned in series with a quarter-wave 
plate, the measured values of the principal 
angle and retardance of the quarter-wave 
plate are found to have average normalized 
errors of 0.56% and 1.16% respectively, 
while the measured rotation angle of the 
half-wave plate has an error of just 0.39%. 
When analyzing glucose solutions with 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.2 g/dl 
positioned in front of a half-wave plate, the 
average normalized errors in the principal 
axis angle and retardance measurements of 
the half-wave plate are 0.69% and 2.65% 
respectively, while the error in the rotation 
angle measurement of the glucose solutions 
is 2.13%. Overall, the uncertainty analysis 
for the rotation angle measurement is 
simulated and experimental results 
demonstrate the ability of the proposed 
system to accurately measure the circular 
and linear birefringence. 
 
Keywords: Circular birefringence; Linear

二、簡介 (Introduction) 
 
An important property of optically 
anisotropic media is birefringence (double 
refraction), which can be classified as either 
linear or circular. In the former case, the 
birefringence effects are determined by 
changes in the principal axis angle and phase 
retardance of the optical medium as the

where 0S  is the total light intensity, 1S  is 
the difference between the intensity of the 
horizontal ( )x  linearly polarized 
component and that of the vertical ( )y  
linearly polarized component, 2S  is the 
difference between the intensity of the 
linearly polarized component oriented at an 
angle of 45° and that of the linearly 
polarized component oriented at an angle of 
-45°, and 3S  is the difference between the 
intensity of the left-circularly polarized 
component and that of the right-circularly 
polarized component. A polarizer oriented 
horizontally ( )x , vertically ( )y , at an angle 
of 45°, or at an angle of -45° emits light 
with an intensity of xI , yI  , 45oI , or 45− oI , 
respectively, whereas an optical 
arrangement comprising a quarter-wave 
plate followed by a polarizer oriented at 45° 
or -45° with respect to the slow axis of the 
wave plate transmits light with an intensity 
of LI  or RI , respectively 
According to the Stokes-Mueller 
formalism, the stokes vector of output light 
is calculated by the inner product of the 
Stokes vector that models the polarization 
state of incident light with the Muller 
matrix that models that optics. Substituting 
Mueller matrices of a composite samples

composite sample of a linearly birefringent 
medium with its principal axis angle α  
and retardance β , LBM , and a chiral 
medium with its optical rotation angle γ ,

light emerging from the composite sample

By means of two probe lights linearly 
polarized at angles of 0° and 45°, 
respectively and via an appropriate 
manipulation of the Mueller matrix 
elements 22m , 23m , 32m  and 33m , the 
retardance and optical rotation angle of the 
composite sample can be estimated as

Eq. (6) represents the first scheme 
presented in the literature in which the 
principal axis angle is decoupled from the

polarizer at 0° and 45° were determined to 
be [ ]1,1, 0, 0.006− T and [ ]1, 0, 0.998, 0 T , 
respectively. The sample was then 
introduced and the principal axis angle of 
the quarter-wave plate in the composite 
sample was rotated incrementally through a 
full 180° (from -40° to 40° in increments of 
10°, and from -90° to -45° and 45° to 90° in 
increments of 15°) while the principal axis 
angle of the half-plate was fixed at -45°. 
Figure 3 presents the linear 
birefringence of the quarter wave-plate 
within the composite sample. From 
inspection, the principal axis angle 
measurements are found to have an average 
absolute error of just 0.18°, with a standard 
deviation of 0.27°. Meanwhile, the average 
normalized error is determined to be 0.56%. 
The correlation coefficient between the 
measured values of the principal axis angle 
and the actual values is determined to be 
0.999985. Thus, it is evident that the 
proposed metrology system has a highly 
linear response. The retardance 
measurements are found to have an average 
absolute error of 1.04° (with a standard 
deviation of 1.18°) and an average 
normalized error of 1.16%. Figure 4 
presents the measurement results obtained 
for the circular birefringence of the 
composite sample. From inspection, the 
measured values of the optical rotation 
angle are found to have an average absolute 
error of 0.35° (with a standard deviation of 
0.44°) and an average normalized error of 
0.39%. Overall, the results presented in 
Figs. 3 and 4 confirm the ability of the 
proposed system to obtain highly-accurate, 
concurrent measurements of the linear and 
circular birefringence properties. 
The feasibility of the proposed 
metrology system was further verified using 
a composite sample comprising a glucose 
solution of a specified concentration 
positioned in front of a half-wave plate with 
its principal axis angle set at 90°. The 
glucose samples were prepared from a 
60-mg/ml stock glucose solution and 
Individual glucose samples with 
concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.2 g/dl 
were prepared by diluting the stock solution 
with an appropriate volume of de-ionized 
water. The glucose samples were injected 
into sample cells with a length of 50 mm 
and were then introduced individually into 
the optical measurement system. The 
Stokes vectors of the two linearly polarized 
probe lights emerging from the polarizer at 
0° and 45° were determined to be 
0 {1, 0.999, 0, 0.006}
∧ = −o TS and 45 {1, 0, 0.997, 0}
∧ =o TS , 
respectively, Figure 5 presents the 
experimental results obtained for the linear 
birefringence of the half-wave plate. From 
inspection, the measured values of the 
principal axis angle and retardance of the 
half-wave plate are found to have average 
normalized errors of 0.69% and 2.65%, 
respectively. 
Figure 6 presents the experimental 
results obtained for the variation of optical 
rotation of glucose sample. From inspection, 
the average normalized error of the rotation 
angle is determined to be 2.13%. In 
addition, the correlation coefficient relating 
the measured rotation angle with the 
glucose concentration is found to be 
0.99985, while the standard deviation is just 
0.0022°. The average normalized error of 
2.13% obtained in this study for the rotation 
angle measurement is lower than the value 
of 4.23 % reported in [10], in which a 
single linearly polarized probe light 
orientated at 45° was used to obtain 
concurrent measurements of the rotation 
angle and retardance of the same composite 
sample. It is noted that the reference 
rotation angle of glucose sample can be 
found in [11].

high-accuracy universal polarimeter for the simultaneous measurement of the optical activity and birefringence 
properties of crystal media. The authors showed that by applying a suitable compensation for the systematic errors 
associated with the parasitic ellipticities of the polarizer and analyzer, respectively, the optical activity and 
birefringence properties of crystal samples could be obtained with an accuracy as high as 4.2 x 10-3 and 2.2 x 10-3, 
respectively. Ebisawa et al. [6] presented a microscopic system for measuring the birefringence and optical rotation 
distribution in biological tissues. The authors showed that by adjusting the rotation angles of the half-wave plate, 
quarter-wave plate and analyzer, respectively, four different phase changes could be introduced, allowing the 
retardation, azimuthal angle of birefringence and optical rotation angle to be extracted. 
 
The current study proposes a novel technique for the concurrent measurement of the principal axis angle, 
phrase retardance and rotation angle of optical samples. In the proposed approach, a rotating-wave-plate Stokes 
polarimeter is used to extract the 2x2 central elements of the Mueller matrix of the sample of interest by means of 
two probe lights linearly polarized at angles of 0°and 45°, respectively. The validity of the proposed approach is 
demonstrated experimentally using two composite samples, namely a half-wave plate positioned in series with a 
quarter-wave plate and a glucose solution positioned in front of a half-wave plate. 
 
 
2. Method 
 
2.1 Optical Configuration 
 
Figure 1 presents a schematic illustration of the optical configuration used in the present study to measure the 
linear and circular birefringence properties of the sample of interest, including the principal axis angle (α ), phase 
retardance ( β ) and optical rotation angle ( γ ). As shown, the system comprises a He-Ne laser, a polarizer and a 
Stokes polarimeter (Thorlabs PA510). In the first stage of the measurement process, the light beam emitted from 
the laser passes through the polarizer, which is positioned with its transmission axis orientated at an angle of 0°, 
and is transmitted through the sample, causing a change in its polarization state. The light beam then enters the 
polarimeter, which measures the values of parameters 1S  and 2S  in the corresponding Stokes vector. The 
polarizer is then rotated such that its transmission axis is orientated at an angle of 45° to the experimental 
framework, and the measurement process is repeated.

Eq. (6) represents the first scheme presented in the literature in which the principal axis angle is decoupled 
from the optical rotation angle when performing the concurrent measurement of the linear and circular 
birefringence properties of an optical sample. Equations (3) and (4) given above for the retardance and rotation 
angle, respectively, are the same as Eqs. (3) and (4) derived by Swami et al. [7]. However, in [7], the relationship 
between the rotation angle and the principal axis angle was not explicitly defined. 
 
2.3 Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 
 
According to [8-9], using Eq. (4) derived for the rotation angle measurement of four factors concerned of the 
measurement uncertainty, i.e. δα  of the misalignment of the principal axis angle, δβ  of the retardance error, the 
error angle of polarizer 
0°Pδ  when 22m  and 32m  are measured, and 45°Pδ  when 23m  and 33m  are measured. 
From Eq. (4), the rotation angle of the circularly birefringent medium is estimated independently of the principal 
axis angle and retardance of the linearly birefringent medium.

coordinate system is assumed to be θ , the partial derivative of the rotation angle with respect to the polarization

error of 0.39 %. Overall, the results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 confirm the ability of the proposed system to obtain 
highly-accurate, concurrent measurements of the linear and circular birefringence properties.

composite sample composed of half-wave plate positioned in front of quarter-wave plate. 
 
The feasibility of the proposed metrology system was further verified using a composite sample comprising a 
glucose solution of a specified concentration positioned in front of a half-wave plate with its principal axis angle set 
at 90°. The glucose samples were prepared from a 60-mg/ml stock glucose solution and Individual glucose 
samples with concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.2 g/dl were prepared by diluting the stock solution with an 
appropriate volume of de-ionized water. The glucose samples were injected into sample cells with a length of 50 
mm and were then introduced individually into the optical measurement system. The Stokes vectors of the two 
linearly polarized probe lights emerging from the polarizer at 0° and 45° were determined to be
