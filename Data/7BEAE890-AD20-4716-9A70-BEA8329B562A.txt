III. DESIGN, SIMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The center frequency of 3.875 GHz is utilized to implement
the proposed broadband BPF in the lower band of the direct-se-
quence code division multiple access (DS–CDMA) system. Its

bandwidth ratio and the ripple are chosen as 50% and 0.01 dB,
respectively. Because the inductive coupling is applied to the in-
verter , the quadruple resonator can be easily implemented
in the multilayered broadband filter. Moreover, the parameters
of electric length , even- and odd-mode impedances and
, capacitors , and the inductance are
as 58.8 , 87.5 , 26.5 , 0.229 pF, 0.53 pF, 0.05 pF, 0.281 pF,
and 80 nH, respectively. Then, convert these values into the mul-
tilayered structure.
The substrate of Dupont 951 is employed for the three-dimen-
sional (3-D) broadband filter and its dielectric constant and loss
tangent are 7.8 and 0.0045, respectively. This filter is designed
on four upper layers with the sheet of 1.57 mil, six middle layers
with the sheet of 3.6 mil, and four lower layers with the sheet
of 1.57 mil. The overall size of the fabricated filter is 132 mil
80 mil 33.72 mil. As shown in Fig. 4, the quadruple res-
onator is placed on layer 4 and 5. Specifically the inverter is
designed on layer 4 with the edge-coupled line to realize the mu-
tual-coupled inductance, and the inverter is designed from
layers 6 to 11 with the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor
to realize the coupling capacitance. Then, the transmission zeros
at the lower and higher sides of passband skirts can be adjusted
by these couplings.
The proposed BPF has been fabricated with the low-tem-
perature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology. Fig. 5 compares
the results of electromagnetic (EM) simulation [8] and experi-
mental measurement. Fig. 5(a) shows frequency responses. The
passband of EM simulation is within 2.95–4.75 GHz and its
bandwidth ratio is 46.8%. The transmission zeros of EM simula-
tion are located at 0.8, 5.25, and 8 GHz. Moreover, the insertion
loss is less than 2 dB; the return loss is greater than 12.5 dB. Sim-
ilarly, the passband of measurement is within 2.98–4.55 GHz
Design of multilayered broadband
bandpass filter with LTCC technology
C.-W. Tang, C.-W. Shen and C.-C. Tseng
With two pairs of asymmetrical feeding short-circuit coupled lines, a
multilayered broadband bandpass filter is proposed and constructed.
To enhance the selectivity of the passband, two pairs of coupled lines
need to be properly connected with both inductive and capacitive
coupling to generate two transmission zeros at both sides of the
passband skirts. Measured results show a bandwidth ratio of the
passband of more than 44.6% when its centre frequency is 3.875 GHz.
Introduction: Miniaturisation and low loss are needed for wireless
communication systems. In addition to high performance and low cost,
compact size is also crucial for circuit design. Low-temperature co-fired
ceramic (LTCC) technology can be utilised to integrate active and
passive circuits in one system. Filters with awide passband are essential
in the radio frequency (RF) front end of UWB receivers [1–5]. The
broadband bandpass filter (BPF) proposed in this Letter consists of two
pairs of asymmetrical feeding short-circuit coupled lines, as shown in
Fig. 1. The asymmetrical feeding short-circuit coupled line can provide
a broader bandwidth than the symmetrical feeding short-circuit coupled
line. To generate transmission zeros at both sides of the passband skirts
for better selectivity, the first and fourth resonators are inductively
coupled while the second and third resonators are capacitively coupled.
Fig. 1 Diagram of proposed broadband bandpass filter
Design theory: Because the transform circuit of the asymmetrical
feeding short-circuit coupled line can be expressed as shown in Fig. 2
[4], then substitute it into Fig. 1 and the equivalent circuit can be
derived. Fig. 3 shows the equivalent circuit of the proposed broadband
bandpass filter. To create the transmission zeros located at the lower
and higher skirts of the passband, the coupling scheme of inverter J14
is inserted between the first and fourth resonators. Then the transmis-
sion zero appears at the condition of Y21jpath ACDBþY21jpath AB¼ 0.

Filter design and measurement: The broadband bandpass filter,
which can be implemented in the lower band of the direct-sequence
ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) system, is designed at a centre frequency
of 3.875 GHz. Its bandwidth ratio and ripple are chosen as 50% and
0.01 dB, respectively. The parameters of electric length y, even- and

circuit coupled line, capacitors C23, C, C01, and C0e, and cross-

wavelength transmission line is utilised to form the matching circuit;
hence, the impedance of this transmission line is 50 O, which is the
value of the system impedance. Therefore, the matching circuit can be
neglected and the filter can be directly connected to the input and
output ports. Fig. 4 shows the circuit simulated results of the designed
broadband bandpass filter.
Next, these values are converted into the multilayered structure.
The three-dimensional (3D) broadband filter is designed with a Dupont
951 substrate, the dielectric constant and loss tangent of which are
7.8 and 0.0045, respectively. This filter is designed on four upper
layers with a 1.57 mil sheet, six middle layers with a 3.6 mil sheet, and
four lower layers with a 1.57 mil sheet. The overall size of the fabricated
filter is 119 79 33.72 mil. Meandered two pairs of asymmetrical
feeding short-circuit coupled lines can not only shrink the filter size,
but a properly arranged coupling coefficient can also be adjusted by

A Microstrip Ultra-Wideband Bandpass Filter With
Cascaded Broadband Bandpass and Bandstop Filters
Ching-Wen Tang, Member, IEEE, and Ming-Guang Chen
Abstract—This paper develops a novel ultra-wideband band-
pass filter by cascading a broadband bandpass filter with another
broadband bandstop filter. Properly selected impedances of
transmission lines achieve broadband bandpass and bandstop
filters and make independent designs possible. Detailed design
and synthesis procedures are provided; moreover, agreement be-
tween measured and theoretically predicted results demonstrates
feasibility of the proposed filter. Due to its simple structure, the
ultra-wideband bandpass filter newly introduced in this paper is
suitable for integration in the single-chipped circuit or implemen-
tation on printed circuit boards.

I. INTRODUCTION
I N RECENT years, there are increasing demands for broaderbandwidth in wireless communication systems; moreover,
much research has focused on ultra-wideband filters. The fre-
quency spectrum adopted for the ultra-wideband system in this
paper, i.e., 3.1–10.6 GHz, follows the one authorized by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for short-range
and high-speed wireless communication [1]. Various methods
to make ultra-wideband filters are reviewed as following.
In addition to parallel-coupled lines and stepped-impedance
resonators, the ground-plane aperture is employed to improve
the coupling coefficient [2], while the capacitive loading is used
to enhance the rejection in the higher stopband [3]. A mul-
tiple-mode resonator and the quarter-wavelength parallel-cou-
pled lines at the input and output ports are adopted in [4] and
[5] to achieve the goals shown in [2] and [3]. The dual-mode
ring resonator cascaded with orthogonal feed lines is used in
[6], double-sided parallel-strip lines are presented in [7], and
three-line microstrip structures are utilized in [8]. References
[9] and [10] make use of transmission zeros on both sides of the
passband skirts to realize ultra-wideband filters. The hybrid mi-
crostrip and coplanar waveguide structure are proposed to make
ultra-wideband filters in [11]–[13]; however, there are compli-
cated design procedures with the double-sided structure. In [14]
and [15], short-circuited stubs and a low-pass filter are utilized

for better performance in an ultra-wideband filter. For flatter
group delay in a wideband bandpass filter, short-circuited stubs
are employed in [16]–[18]. Nevertheless, circuit sizes are not
satisfying because of multiple short-circuit stubs employed; de-
tailed procedures for filter development are lacking; proposed
ultra-wideband filters cannot be practically implemented in an
ultra-wideband system.
Due to the trend toward broader bandwidth and better selec-
tivity, filters with a wide stopband in a linear wideband system
are promising. In order to achieve this goal, this paper pro-
poses a compact ultra-wideband filter by connecting a broad-
band bandstop filter with a broadband bandpass filter where two
short-circuit stubs are employed. With the broadband bandstop
filter presented in this paper instead of the bandstop filter de-
veloped by Hsieh and Wang [19], there is a steeper slope on
the lower side of the stopband, and performances of the broad-
band bandpass filter and the broadband bandstop filter would

key components in the front end of the concurrent dual-band
receiver, and there have been numerous studies on dual-band ﬁlters
[1-4].
In this article, we also use low-temperature co-ﬁred ceramic
(LTCC) technology to construct a novel three-dimensional (3D)
dual-band bandpass ﬁlter. Figure 1 shows the architecture of this
dual-band bandpass ﬁlter, where multiple quarter-wavelength
stepped impedance resonators are connected with the transmission
line section. Each transmission line of the proposed dual-band
bandpass ﬁlter could be easily transferred to multilayered structure
individually; moreover, the quarter-wavelength stepped imped-
ance resonators can generate a transmission zero in the middle of
dual passbands. The ﬁlter proposed herein not only provides equal-
ized dual-band response, but also introduces a transmission zero in
the middle of two passbands. The transmission zero can enhance
the isolation between two passbands and reduce the image signal
in the receiver link. The analysis equation of the dual-band band-
pass ﬁlter can be obtained from the newly proposed circuit. This
equation, more generalized than that in our previous study, is
suitable for dual-band bandpass ﬁlter with all orders.
In Section 2, the detailed design theory for synthesis of the
dual-band ﬁlter is presented. Then, the simulated and measured
results are described in Section 3. Our conclusions are given in
Section 4.
2. DESIGN THEORY
As shown in Figure 1, this newly proposed dual-band bandpass
ﬁlter is constructed with multiple quarter-wavelength stepped im-
pedance resonators and connected transmission lines. In this arti-
cle, we propose the transformed circuit for the connected trans-
mission lines as Figure 2 to develop the dual-band bandpass ﬁlter.
The transformed admittance inverter of a connected transmission
line can be expressed as
J  Y1csc1 (1)
where Y1 and 1 are the corresponding admittance and electric
length of a connected transmission line.
An immittance inverter [5, 6] is adopted in this article to
analyze the proposed ﬁlter. Substitute the transformed circuit
(shown in Fig. 2) into Figure 1; therefore, the equivalent circuit of
the proposed n-ordered dual-band ﬁlter can be demonstrated as
Figure 3.

4. CONCLUSION
A new structure of dual-band bandpass ﬁlter has been studied in
this letter. This dual-band ﬁlter with the capability of high inte-
gration and small size is very suitable for implementation in a
multi-chip module. Multiple stepped impedance resonators are
shunt-connected with the transmission line section. By using this
approach, a transmission zero will easily appear in the middle of
two passbands to increase the isolation. Our proposed technique
makes it easy to design the dual-band bandpass ﬁlter with equal-
ized bandwidth. The LTCC dual-band bandpass ﬁlters are de-
signed and measured in frequency bands of 2 and 7 GHz. When
realizing a physical 3D circuit, the parasitic effect among capaci-
tors may cause this model to differ from the ideal values provided
by the circuit simulator. These effects may make the measured and
theoretical predicted results different as well. The design proce-
dures have been described in detail, and the 3D architecture is
provided. The dual-band ﬁlter has been successfully designed, and
its measured results have shown good agreement with the theoret-
ical predictions.

ABSTRACT: This article presents a simpliﬁed approach for character-
ization of ultra wideband (UWB) through-the-wall propagation. The sim-
pliﬁed approach requires spectrum analyzer rather than vector network
analyzer. A minimum phase retrieval method based on Hilbert transform is
used to retrieve the phase information. The proposed method is shown to be
applicable to the insertion transfer function. While linear phase component
cannot be retrieved, important factors for UWB receiver design such as
group delay ripple and dispersion effect can be retrieved. In noisy channels,
phase retrieval could be superior to direct phase measurements. Estimation
of linear phase component can be achieved through matching the measured
phase with the retrieved phase. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave

1. INTRODUCTION
Indoor wireless communication signals propagate through differ-
ent media. Accurate characterization of communication links re-
quires excellent knowledge of the material properties in the com-
munications channel. This knowledge allows for the evaluation of
the applicability of the system for the indoor environment and the
system coverage. A signiﬁcant amount of research work has been
performed for characterization of narrowband channels [1]. Be-
cause of its different nature and bandwidth occupancy, the intro-
duction of UWB communications [2] as an alternative indoor
wireless technology has given rise to the need for more measure-
ments in the UWB frequency range.
The unique capabilities of UWB technology make it a potential
candidate for short-range multiple access indoor wireless commu-
nications applications, home-networking, and secure military ap-
plications. UWB communication can support high transmission
rates, has excellent wall-penetration capabilities, and consumes
very low power. Besides communication applications, UWB can
also be used for range measurements. UWB receivers can measure
the arrival time of transmitted pulses to within a fraction of a
picosecond.
In general, UWB characterization requires the extraction of the
impulse response of the channel or its equivalent transfer function.
The impulse response is then used to estimate the time dispersion
parameters required for simulation or receiver design. Measure-
ments can be carried out in the time domain or in the frequency
domain. The conversion from the time domain to the frequency
domain or vice-versa can be accomplished by the Fourier trans-
form or the inverse Fourier transform, respectively. If measure-
ments are conducted carefully both domains should result in sim-
ilar conclusions [3].
Channel measurements for communication applications are
usually performed in the frequency domain because of the avail-
ability of the required instrumentations, the moderate cost, and the
large associated dynamic range [4]. The conversion to the impulse
response requires both the magnitude and the phase of the fre-
quency-domain channel transfer function. For narrowband channel
characterization, the phase data are less important because the
phase can be approximated as a linear phase component. For UWB
channels, however, the phase is a critical parameter and the nature
of its variations with frequency over an ultra-wide bandwidth can
signiﬁcantly impact the time-domain response. If the delay is not
constant for different frequency components, the received signal
will be distorted.
Vector network analyzers (VNA) can measure both the mag-

be feasible. This is because the VNA requires the received signal
to be fed back for comparison with the input signal. At the upper

2.1 Two transmission zeros on the same side of
the passband
The outband rejection would be increased when two trans-
mission zeros appear on the same side of the passband skirt.
If two transmission zeros are located in the lower pass-
band skirt, the admittance inverters of J01, J12, J23 at the
angular frequency vz2 need to be modified with

where the electric length u2 is equal to u0(vz2/v0).
If two transmission zeros are located in the higher pass-
band skirt, the admittance inverter J12 at the angular
frequency vz2 is obtained from (4), whereas the admittance

2.2 Two transmission zeros on the opposite side
of the passband
Because both the inductor L and capacitor C are combined
within the susceptance B(v), the denominator of (2) is
greater than zero and the numerator must be positive too.
According to Yeung and Wu [6], the inverters of J01, J12,
J23 and JSL could be set as negative, positive,
negative and negative, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3.
Specifically the positive value of the J-inverter represents
the circuit with the capacitive coupling, whereas the nega-
tive value of the J-inverter represents the circuit with the
inductive coupling.

be developed readily. Fig. 6 shows the simulated results

two output ports significantly.

and grounded capacitor CP are set as 0.01 dB, 6% and 5 pF,
respectively. Using the structure shown in Fig. 3, the
inverters of J01, J12 and J23 are calculated as 0.0142,
0.0106 and 0.0142, respectively; the calculated parameters
of C01, C23, Cp, Lp and L12 are 1.33, 1.33, 4.33 pF, 1.02
and 6.27 nH, respectively. Table 1 shows the calculated

The second-ordered combline bandpass filter is composed
of a cross-coupled capacitor C12, a coupled line and two
grounded capacitors CP as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 10 shows
the equivalent circuits of the transformed cross-coupled
capacitor C12 and the transformed coupled line. The equiv-

where Y0e and Y0o are, respectively, the even- and odd-mode
admittance of coupled transmission line, and u is the corre-
sponding electric length.
Adding two circuits shown in Fig. 10, and shunting with
two grounded capacitors CP at two ports separately yields
the complete equivalent circuit of the bandpass filter, as
shown in Fig. 11. Thus, we can apply the immittance inver-

Realization of Multilayered Wide-Passband
Bandpass Filter With Low-Temperature
Co-Fired Ceramic Technology
Ching-Wen Tang, Senior Member, IEEE, and Dong-Lin Yang
Abstract—This paper develops a new multilayered wide-pass-
band bandpass filter with the assistance of low-temperature
co-fired ceramic technology. The mutually inductive coupling
between the input and output port of a low- and high-pass filter
cascaded in the proposed filter is utilized as well. The results
show that in the passband of 3.1–4.9 GHz, the measured insertion
loss and return loss of this filter are less than 1.1 dB and greater
than 18 dB, respectively. In addition, the insertion loss from dc to
2.76 GHz is greater than 20 dB, and the one from 5.8 to 12 GHz
is greater than 30 dB.
Index Terms—Low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC), wide-
passband bandpass filter.
I. INTRODUCTION
W IRELESS communication has dramatically developedand there are greater demands for bandwidth, quality,
and transmission rate in recent years. In addition to high per-
formance and low cost, sizes should be taken into consideration
for circuit design. Therefore, the low-temperature co-fired ce-
ramic (LTCC) technology [1]–[5] is a good candidate for size
reduction because by using it, 3-D inductors, capacitors, and
passive circuits can be integrated into the multilayered ceramic
substrates.
Much research has focused on broadband filters in recent
years [6]–[17]. In addition to parallel-coupled lines and stepped-
impedance resonators, the ground-plane aperture and capacitive
loading are employed to improve the coupling coefficient and to
increase the rejection in the higher stopband, respectively [6],
[7]. On the other hand, in [8] and [9], the quarter-wavelength
parallel-coupled lines at the input and output ports are adopted
to enhance the rejection level within the higher stopband. More-
over, the dual-mode ring resonator cascaded with orthogonal
feeding lines is used in [10], double-sided parallel-strip lines are

presented in [11], and three-line microstrip structures are uti-
lized in [12]. Furthermore, [13]–[15] make use of transmission
zeros on both sides of the passband skirts to realize broadband
filters. Additionally, [15] is based on the microstrip–coplanar-
waveguide (CPW) structure, and the high-pass filter is realized
with the cross-coupled capacitance between input and output
ports. By combining a high- and low-pass filter, wide-passband
bandpass filters are created in [16] and [17]. However, without
transmission zeros, a satisfying slope is lacking at each side of
the passband skirt.
As shown in Fig. 1, a novel multilayered wide-passband
bandpass filter with integration of a high- and low-pass filter
is proposed in this paper. In particular, the mutually inductive
coupling between input and output ports of both the high- and
low-pass filter is employed to generate more transmission zeros
and improve the selectivity. Moreover, compared to the pure
bandpass filter counterpart, e.g., [18], there would be lower
insertion loss in the newly provided bandpass filter.
In Section II, two novel circuit schematics are presented and
analyzed. In Section III, an electromagnetic simulator [19] is
used to analyze and design the multilayered high- and low-pass
filter. A wide-passband bandpass filter is presented by cascading
the multilayer high- and low-pass filters. Moreover, measured
results of the low-pass, high-pass, and newly proposed band-
pass filters are provided; furthermore, the experimental and sim-
ulated results match well. Finally, Section IV concludes this
paper.

rated in the earlier study. With the mutually inductive coupling
, three transmission zeros would appear in the higher pass-
band skirt of the newly proposed low-pass filter.
In order to simplify analysis procedures, the circuit shown
in Fig. 4(a) can be transformed into the structure in Fig. 4(b).
The equations for transformation are as follows:

tained by analytic geometry, as shown in the Appendix, the de-

rived value cannot be fine tuned easily. Therefore, an alternative
method is utilized, as shown in Fig. 5(a), where the transmis-
sion zeros would occur when and are with the same
magnitude, but at the opposite phase. Moreover, the desired lo-
cations of the transmission zeros can be obtained by properly
selecting the value of the mutually inductive coupling .
As an example, 5.7 and 5 GHz are chosen for the frequency
of attenuation pole and the cutoff frequency of the proposed
low-pass filter, respectively. With the assistance of the gener-
alized Chebyshev filter and 0.05 adopted for the mutually in-
ductive coupling , values of corresponding components
(or ), (or ), (or ), and (or ) are
then obtained as 0.76 pF, 1.03 nH, 0.58 pF, and 1.01 nH, respec-
tively. As a result, transmission zeros appear at 5.42, 6.91, and
9.87 GHz, as shown in Fig. 5.
According to (9), when the value of the mutually inductive
coupling increases, the value of the inductor increases
as well. Therefore, according to (A5)–(A7), , frequency of
the transmission zero, increases, while and decrease.
This tendency matches with what Fig. 5(a) shows, i.e., when
the mutually inductive coupling is larger, the slope of
Magnitude is steeper. Therefore, the transmission zero,
intersection of Magnitude and Magnitude, in the
middle moves to the higher frequency, while the transmission
zeros on the left and right shift to the lower frequency. More-
over, Fig. 5(b) indicates that with mutually inductive coupling,
there would be greater attenuation in the higher passband skirt
of the proposed low-pass filter and the performance in the
passband would not be influenced.
III. FILTER IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

and are coupled in layer 3.
Fig. 7(b) presents the compared result of measured and
electromagnetically simulated responses. In the passband of
3–4.9 GHz, the measured insertion loss is less than 0.7 dB,
while the return loss is greater than 12.7 dB. Moreover, three
transmission zeros located at 6.062, 8.067, and 9.285 GHz
make the insertion loss greater than 30 dB when the frequency
band is within 5.83–13.4 GHz. Furthermore, these results agree
well with electromagnetic simulation, even though compared
to electromagnetic simulation, the measured transmission zero
in the middle appears at a higher frequency and the one on the

(C11þ 2C12).
As a result, the proposed bandpass ﬁlter combining with
two ﬁlters as mentioned above can have four transmission
zeros located at both sides of passband skirts.
3 Design, simulation and
experimental results
Because directly adding type-1 and 2 ﬁlters would damage the
circuit matching in the passband design, taking the frequency
band of 2.4 GHz as an example and the proposed bandpass
ﬁlter can be obtained by the procedures shown in [16]. The
corresponding component values C12, C01 (or C02), C1, L1,
L2, C11 (or C22), L11 (or L22) and L3 in Fig. 1 are 0.74 pF,
0.96 pF, 5.6 pF, 0.67 nH, 0.05 nH, 7.5 pF, 0.5 nH and
0.05 nH, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the simulated responses
of the proposed bandpass ﬁlter. It seems that this bandpass
ﬁlter only has three transmission zeros located at the
frequencies 1.65, 2.02 and 4.07 GHz. Then, using the
Y-parameter method, the last transmission zero will appear
at the frequency of 18.23 GHz as shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 3b
also reveals that the smaller inductances of L2 and L3 will
result in the transmission zero shifting to the extremely
higher frequency.
The next step is converting the planar circuit of Fig. 1 into
a multilayered structure via the electromagnetic (EM)
simulator. This simulation is carried out with the assistance
of full-wave EM simulator, called Sonnet from Sonnet
Software Inc. The multilayered LTCC bandpass ﬁlter has
been fabricated on the substrate of Dupont 951 with
dielectric constant 7.8 and 16 green sheets. The thickness
of the top four sheets is 0.04 mm, the thickness of the next
six sheets is 0.09 mm, the thickness of the next four sheets
is 0.04 mm and the thickness of the last two sheets is
0.09 mm, and the overall size is 3.5  3.15  1.04 mm3.
Figs. 4a and 4b show the three-dimensional (3-D)
structure and photograph of the proposed bandpass ﬁlter,
and the measured and EM simulated results and group
delays are shown in Figs. 4c and 4d, respectively. Three
measured and EM-simulated transmission zeros are located
at the frequencies 1.66, 1.83, 3.94 GHz and 1.54, 2.02,
4.02 GHz, respectively. Moreover, within the passband of
2.35 and 2.55 GHz, the measured insertion loss, group
delay and return loss are less than 1.45 dB, 1.1 ns and
greater than 14 dB, respectively.
4 Conclusion
A new LTCC bandpass ﬁlter is proposed in this paper. The
integrated structure and analysis with combining two types of
ﬁlters are introduced as well. The fabricated LTCC bandpass
ﬁlter with the characteristics of high integration and small
size is very suitable for the implementation in the multichip
module. Moreover, the measured results match well with
the EM simulation and theoretical one. These results show
the validity of the proposed structure and design method.

ABSTRACT: A multilayered triplexer is proposed in this article. The
ordered of this proposed triplexer can be reduced by inserting a trans-
mission zero, which can also enhance the isolation between two sepa-
rate passbands. Lowpass and highpass ﬁlters, which can make a di-
plexer due to their complementary characteristics, are utilized to reduce
the insertion loss of the proposed triplexer. Moreover, the low-tempera-
ture coﬁred ceramic technology can miniaturize the size of the triplexer.
The procedures of circuit design are provided in this article as well.
Excellent agreement between measurement and simulation validates the
feasibility of the proposed conﬁguration. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

transmission zeros can attenuate the unwanted signal in the low-
pass ﬁlter (LPF) or highpass ﬁlter (HPF) so that the circuit can be
simpliﬁed and the system performance can be improved. As shown
in Figure 3, type-I and type-II resonant pair, which can generate
transmission zeros, are utilized for implementation in the multi-
layered circuit. On the one hand, a shunted resonator, the type-I
resonant pair, is employed in the LPF. On the other hand, a series
resonator, the type-II resonant pair, is adopted for HPF.
If the frequency of input signal (from port 1) is lower than 1.0
GHz, a lowpass ﬁlter is adopted to preserve low insertion loss
within the frequency band of 0.8–1.0 GHz at the 0.9-GHz output
port (port 2), as shown in Figure 2. The equivalent circuit of the
1.0-GHz LPF is shown in Figure 4. To attenuate the spurious
signal in the other two frequency bands, two transmission zeros are
utilized in this lowpass ﬁlter. This 1.0-GHz LPF is composed of
two series resonant pairs L11, C11 and L12, C13, and one shunt
capacitor C12. The capacitor C14 is used for matching with the
0.9-GHz output port (port 2). The frequencies of two transmission
zeros generated in the 1.0-GHz LPF are as

On the other hand, if the input signal frequency is greater than
1.7 GHz, then the signal from the input port (port 1) will pass
through the 1.7-GHz HPF, while the signal within the frequency
band of 0.8–1.0 GHz will be rejected. Two series capacitors C21

When signal frequencies are greater than 2.4 GHz, signals can

composed of two shunt resonant pairs L41, C42 and L42, C44 and

match with 1.9-GHz LPF. The frequencies of two transmission

3. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The frequency bands of our proposed triplexer are set at 0.9/1.8/
2.4-GHz. In the 1.0-GHz LPF, the corresponding component val-
ues in Figure 4 are L11  4.49 nH, C11  1.64 pF, C12  4.67 pF,
L12  6.16 nH, C13  0.686 pF, and C14  3 pF. Frequencies of
two transmission zeros fz1 and fz2 are obtained according to (1) and
(2) as 1.85 and 2.45 GHz, respectively, shown in Figure 5(a).
Signals with a higher frequency can go through the 1.7-GHz HPF.
The corresponding component values are C21 2.2 pF, L21 6.15
nH, and C22  3.5 pF, C23  0.9 pF. The frequency of the
transmission zero fz3 is obtained according to (3) as 1.085 GHz
shown in Figure 5(a). The corresponding component values of
matching circuit are L22  4 nH, C24  2.14 pF.
In the 1.9-GHz LPF, the corresponding component values are
L31 1.51 nH, C31 3 pF, C32 1.64 pF, L32 1.6 nH, and C33
 2.54 pF. Frequencies of two transmission zeros fz4 and fz5,
shown in Figure 5(a), are obtained according to (4) and (5) as 2.36
and 2.5 GHz, respectively, while the rest of signals go through the
2.4-GHz HPF. The corresponding component values are C41 
0.89 pF, L41 8 nH, C42 0.8 pF, C43 0.98 pF, L42 11.5 nH,
and C44  0.67 pF. Frequencies of two transmission zeros fz6 and
fz7 are obtained according to (6) and (7) as 2 and 1.8 GHz,
respectively, shown in Figure 5(a). These parameters can then be
substituted into a circuit simulator, such as ADS or equivalent
software, to carry out the circuit simulation.
After circuit simulation, these values are converted into the
LTCC structure, and the circuit size is 210 mil 210 mil 40.5
mil shown in Figure 6. The simulation is carried out with the
assistance of the full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulator Sonnet
(Sonnet Software, North Syracuse, NY). Figure 8 shows the results
of EM simulation, which match well with that of circuit simulation
shown in Figure 5. The multilayered LTCC triplexer was fabri-
cated on a Dupont 951 substrate. Its dielectric constant and loss
tangent are 7.8 and 0.0045, respectively. This LTCC triplexer is
designed on four upper layers with the 1.57 mil sheet, six middle
layers with the 3.6 mil sheet, four following layers with the 1.57
mil sheet, and two lowest layers with the 3.6 mil sheet. Figure 7
shows the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture of the fabricated
triplexer.
An on-wafer tester has been employed in order to improve the
accuracy of measurement. The network analyzer, Agilent N5230A
PNA_L, is used for measurement, whereas the short-open-load-
through (SOLT) is used for calibration. As shown in Figure 8(a),
the measured insertion losses are less than 0.5, 1.3, and 1.4 dB in
the frequency bands of 0.9, 1.8, and 2.4 GHz, respectively. The
return losses larger than 15 dB indicate that the input ports and
three frequency bands match well. The measured values of isola-
tion between two frequency bands of the output ports of the
triplexer are shown in Figure 8(b).
4. CONCLUSION
A newly developed triplexer has been proposed in this article.
This triplexer is very suitable to implement on the multichip
module because of its high integration and compact size. In-
serting the transmission zero can enhance the isolation among
three passbands. The agreement between measurement and the-
oretical prediction has demonstrated the feasibility of this
study.

ABSTRACT: A new design of the printed omnidirectional antenna
for applications in 2.4/5-GHz dual-WLAN-band access points is pro-
posed. The antenna consists of a conventional collinear antenna for
2.4 GHz operation and two U stubs for 5 GHz operation. The two U
stubs are located near the points where the maximum currents at
about 5.5 GHz occurring on the strips of the collinear antenna and
arranged back-to-back in the same phase for achieving better an-
tenna gain. Detailed analyses of the U stub on the impedance match-
ing over the 5 GH band is presented. A prototype with good omnidi-
rectional radiation across the 2.4/5-GHz WLAN bands is

where k is the Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature,
F is the noise factor of core transistor, Ps is the average power
dissipated in the tank, 0 is the oscillation frequency, Q is the
quality factor of the total tank, and  is the offset from the
carrier. Ps is V2rms/RP where Vrms is the root mean square voltage
across the tank.
Moreover, the buffer ampliﬁers M7 and M8 designed with
NMOS of W/L  320 m/0.18 m can have the features of
reducing the pulling on the VCO at variation of load and
increasing the output power. Furthermore, the octagonal spiral
inductor with differential conﬁguration is used to achieve
higher quality factor, smaller circuit area, and suitable for
differential topology.
The 2.2/4.9-GHz dual-band VCO is as a design example.
Selecting inductors L1 and L2 to be 1.22 and 2.5 nH, respec-
tively, and the capacitors C1 and C2 can be derived as 0.865 and
0.531 pF, respectively. Moreover, using TSMC 0.18-m RF
model version 1.3a, the inductors L1 and L2 are fabricated with
R  69 m, width  15 m, two turns and R  52 m,
width  15 m, four turns, respectively. Figure 3(b) shows a
photomicrograph of the 2.2/4.9-GHz dual-band VCO, and its

Integrating the dual-band VCO with the LTCC dual-band ﬁlter
as shown in Figure 4, the dual-band VCO module cannot only
operate at two frequency bands, but also can achieve harmonic
suppression. When the fabricated dual-band VCO module with

ABSTRACT: In this article, a compact cascade quadruplet bandpass
ﬁlter has been proposed. This bandpass ﬁlter has been realized with the
semilumped method and can generate a pair of transmission zeros at the
two sides of passband by using the nonadjacent cross coupling. The
analysis and design procedures are provided in this article. To minia-
turize the size of the circuit and improve its performance, multilay-
ered structure and the low-temperature coﬁred ceramic technology
are employed to design and fabricate the ﬁlter. Measurement results
agree well with the electromagnetic simulation, which can validate
the proposed structure. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave

1. INTRODUCTION
Compact size and low insertion loss are essential speciﬁcations
within the modern telecommunication systems. To realize multi-
band behavior, RF transceivers with more bandwidth and ﬂexibil-
ity are utilized. Meanwhile, the technologies for integrating pas-
sive circuits to achieve multifunction, high performance, and chip-
size are attractive for the microwave and millimeter-wave
applications. Therefore, the low-temperature coﬁred ceramic
(LTCC) [1–6] seems to be one of the most efﬁcient methods for
miniaturizing and packaging technologies [7–10] because LTCC
can integrate both passive and active components in a module to
achieve the system-in-a-package (SiP) approach.
The bandpass ﬁlter is one of the most important components in
the RF front-end. It can select passband frequencies and reduce the
inﬂuence from frequencies of the adjacent channels. The lowpass
prototypes have been discussed in several articles [11, 12]. Levy
[13] has proposed a uniﬁed theory for the synthesis of exactly
equiripple lowpass prototypes. To realize a single pair of attenu-
ation poles at ﬁnite frequencies, Yu and Chang [14] and Hong and
Lancaster [15] adopt the microstrip open-loop resonators. Hsu et
al. [16] have also adopted the coupled-resonators to design the
group-delay equalizers. In this article, the coupling scheme is
proposed to control the locations of transmission zeros at both
sides of passband skirts. Detailed analyses of coupling scheme and
design equations are introduced in Section 2. The multilayered
structure of bandpass ﬁlter and fabricated unit are provided in
Section 3. Section 4 concludes this article.
2. THEORY OF FILTER
The immittance inverter is adopted to analyze our proposed ﬁlter
[17, 18]. The four-ordered quasi-elliptic bandpass ﬁlter with cross-
coupling can generate a ﬁrst pair of transmission zeros at ﬁnite
frequencies. As shown in Figure 1, the inverter J14 is connected to
nodes A and B. The condition of generating the ﬁrst pair of
transmission zeros is Y21 path ACDB  Y21 path AB  0. Assuming
all of the resonators Bi() are equal to B(), the equation can be
derived as
J12J23J34
B2  J232
  J14 (1)
Within the susceptance B(), both the inductor L and capacitor C
are combined. This result may make the denominator of Eq. (1)
greater than zero. Table 1 shows the relation between J12, J23, J34,
and J14. The positive value of J-inverter represents the circuit
using the inductive coupling for the feedback loop, and the nega-
tive value of J-inverter represents the circuit using the capacitive
coupling for the feedback loop.
Using the combline ﬁlter as an example, the center frequency
and bandwidth ratio are deﬁned as 2.4 GHz and 0.1, respectively,
and the characteristic impedance Z0 and the electric length  of
transmission line are chosen as 25  and 25°, respectively. If the
ripple of Chebyshev response is 0.01 dB, then the values of each
inverter, as shown in Figure 1, can be calculated as J01  J45 
0.016, J12  J34  0.00992, and J23  0.00729. Here, the
frequency of transmission zero is located at the lower side of the
passband at 1.9 GHz, and J14 can be derived, by Eq. (1), as
0.000394. Figure 2 shows the simulated results of four-ordered
bandpass ﬁlters with and without the cross-coupled inverter J14.
For simpliﬁcation, the inverters can be replaced with quarter-
J12J01 J23 J34 J45RS RL

zeros and the design procedures of ﬁlters have been analyzed. The
proposed bandpass ﬁlter fabricated with the multiayered structure
is realized using the semilumped method. The fabricated bandpass
ﬁlter with the characteristics of high integration and small size is
very suitable for the implementation in the multichip module.
Agreement between measurement and theoretical prediction has
evidenced the feasibility of our study.

A Coplanar Waveguide Dual-band Filter With Spiral Coupled Lines 
Ching-Wen Tang, Ming-Guang Chen, and Janne-Wha Wu 
Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan 
cwtang@ccu.edu.tw 
 
Introduction 
 
In recent applications, the coexistence of a dual-band multimode wireless local area network 
(WLAN) and a mobile communication system required the reuse of building blocks and 
power in multifunctional terminals. Dual-band filters have become key components in the 
front end of the concurrent dual-band receiver. There have been many studies on dual-band 
filters. With sharper skirt selectivity, the Zolotarev responses used in the Zolotarev bandpass 
filters may result in lower passband distortion [1]. In [2], the dual-band filter is constructed 
with two different filters set in parallel. The frequency-selective resonator filters [3], the 
stepped impedance resonator (SIR) filters [4], the multiple capacitively loaded coupled-line 
filter [5], and the coupled resonator pairs [6] are also employed to design dual-band filters.  
 
In this paper, the dual-band filter is implemented with the feature of coplanar waveguide 
(CPW). By integrating the spiral coupled line into the lowpass filter, the proposed filter can 
easily achieve the dual-band characteristic and a wide stopband in the higher passband skirt. 
Moreover, the proposed dual-band filter without using the lumped element can be easily 
realized on the planar circuits. The fabricated filter not only occupies a small space, but also 
reveals good circuit performance. Good agreement between the measured and simulated 
results are observed.

where Z1, Z2, θ1, and θ2 represent the characteristic impedances and the electric lengths of the 
equivalent lowpass filter, respectively. Z0 is the characteristic impedance in the input and

A Dual-Band VCO Module With Harmonic Suppression 
Ching-Wen Tang, Ming-Guang Chen, and Janne-Wha Wu 
Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan 
cwtang@ccu.edu.tw 
 
Introduction 
 
Recently, more bandwidth and flexibility have become the requirements for modern wireless 
communication systems. In order to make the wireless communication systems cost effective, 
especially for portable devices, circuits with smaller size are preferred. 
 
Voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) have been widely used in communication systems. In 
this paper, a dual-band VCO module with harmonic suppression has been proposed. This 
dual-band VCO module is developed by integrating a dual-band filter with a dual-band VCO. 
Moreover, adopting the low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology [1, 2] the 
three-dimensional (3-D) dual-band filter can be developed with compact size. Fig. 1 shows 
the schema of this dual-band filter, where the mutual coupling between the input and output 
ports is employed to generate more transmission zeros and improve the selectivity; moreover, 
two open stubs are utilized in the both input and output ports to cause the passband separation 
into two passbands. 
 
The dual-band VCO is then constructed with the LC-tank oscillator, which can provide a 
lower power consumption and high operating frequency. Moreover, the frequency tuning is 
implemented by varying the control voltage of the varactor. Furthermore, based on the 
existing phase noise models, this dual-band VCO has better trade-off tuning range, phase 
noise and power consumption. As a result, the newly developed dual-band VCO module with 
the feature of harmonic suppression can obtain a purer signal source. 
 
Dual-Band Filter 
 
The purpose of the dual-band filter is to produce the harmonic suppression of two frequency 
bands. Fig. 1 shows the architecture of the proposed dual-band filter. The main structure of 
this proposed filter is a modified lowpass filter. Then, the cross coupling between the input 
and output ports can generate transmission zeros to cause the harmonic suppression in the 
higher passband side. Moreover, the purpose of two open stubs added at the input and output 
ports separately, is to split the original passand into two passbands. Therefore, the harmonic 
of the lower passband can be suppressed. 
 
For the example of a 2.2/4.9-GHz dual-band VCO module, the dual-band filter needs to 
generate two transmission zeros located at the frequencies of 4.4 and 9.8 GHz. However, the 
transmission zero located at the frequency of 4.4 GHz is close to the passband of 4.9 GHz, 
which may cause the difficulty in the design of dual-band filter. Therefore, the compromising 
specification of dual-band filter is setting its central frequencies at 2.2 and 5.43 GHz. The 
electric length θ and impedance Z of two open stubs operated at 4.4 GHz are 90o and 230 Ω, 
respectively. As a result, the designed parameters of mutual coupling M, inductors L1 and L2, 
capacitors C1, C1′, and C2 of this filter are 0.1, 0.21 nH, 1.62 nH, 0.1 pF, 0.39 pF, and 0.25 
pF, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the responses of circuit simulation. Furthermore, converting 
these values into a 3-D structure, as shown in Fig. 2(a), with the assistant of the full-wave 
electromagnetic simulator [3]. The multilayered dual-band filter can be fabricated with the 
LTCC technology on the Dupont 951 substrate. Its dielectric constant and loss tangent are 7.8 
978-1-4244-2642-3/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 
Integrating the dual-band VCO with the LTCC dual-band filter as shown in Fig. 4, the dual-
band VCO module can not only operate at two frequency bands, but also can achieve 
harmonic suppression. When the fabricated dual-band VCO module with harmonic 
suppression operated at 2.227 GHz, it can achieve the suppressions of 38.61 and 50.3 dB for 
the first and second harmonic, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(a), and its measured phase 
noise, power consumption, and figure-of-merit are -128.11 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, 9 mW, 
and -188.28 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, respectively. In addition as shown in Fig. 5(b), this 
dual-band VCO with harmonic suppression operated at 4.9 GHz, can achieve the suppression 
more than 40 dB for all harmonics, and its measured phase noise, power consumption, and 
figure-of-merit are -121 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, 9 mW, and -176.28 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz 
offset, respectively. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The proposed dual-band VCO module with harmonic suppression has been disclosed in this 
paper. Designing this dual-band VCO module has involved both processes of LTCC and 
CMOS 0.18-μm for the dual-band filter and the dual-band VCO, respectively. Moreover, this 
design possesses the features of high integration and small size and realizes the 
implementation of the multichip module, which can be easily applied to the design of 
microwave or millimeter-wave integrated circuits.

Abstract— Novel dual-band bandpass filters are proposed in this 
paper. With the assistance of symmetrical feeding, the short-end 
coupled lines are adopted for the main structure of the proposed 
filter. Moreover, the dual-passband responses are accomplished 
by integrating two passband filters with the same structure. The 
theorem for analysis is presented in this paper as well. Finally, 
measured and simulated results of the fabricated examples 
match well so that the feasibility of filter configuration has been 
validated. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Multi-band operation is often required for microwave 
communication systems nowadays due to the explosive 
growth of wireless communication services. Although the 
standard architecture of the heterodyne transceiver is highly 
selective and sensitive, it is operated within a narrow band. 
Specifically, besides the bandwidth, available channels and 
functionalities are also limited. Therefore, simple, low-cost, 
and high-performance multi-band filters are essential in 
wireless communication systems. 
Various studies on the dual-band transceivers have 
investigated how to increase the functionality by switching 
signals between two different bands [1], [2]. The bandpass 
filter (BPF) is one of the most important components at the 
RF front end. The dual-band filters can be developed with the 
following approaches: the wide band Zolotarev filter [3], two 
different filters set in parallel [4], frequency-selective 
resonator filter [5]-[8], multiple-capacitively-loaded coupled-
line filter [9], and coupled resonator pairs [10], etc. 
This paper proposes a novel structure of dual-band filters 
by cascoding two independent BPFs, shown in Fig. 1. Because 
two BPFs can be designed independently, passbands’ 
bandwidths can be equal or different. Moreover, both BPFs 
can generate two transmission zeros within two passband 
skirts. In particular, transmission zeros can increase the 
isolation between two separate passbands, and reduce image 
signals from the receiver link. The theorem for dual-band 
filter synthesis is introduced in Section II. The design 
procedures and measured results are described in Section III. 
Section IV concludes this paper.

II. DESIGN THEORY 
As shown in Fig. 1, the newly proposed dual-band BPF is 
composed of two parallel BPFs with the same structure. Both 
BPFs can generate transmission zeros around the passband 
skirts. The transmission zero within the higher passband skirt 
is generated by the short-end coupled line with symmetrical 
feeding. On the other hand, the other transmission zero within 
the lower passband skirt is resulted from the edge coupling 
between the input and output transmission line. 
The input impedance of the short-end coupled line with 
symmetrical feeding is [11]

with narrower passband of the 2.45-GHz BPF. Specifically, 
6.6% and 11.2% are chosen for the passband bandwidth of the 
2.45- and 5.2-GHz filter, respectively. On the contrary, Table 
III shows dimensions of the proposed dual-band BPF with the 
wider passband of the 2.45-GHz BPF. Specifically, 12.3% and 
4.8% are chosen for the passband bandwidth of the 2.45- and 
5.2-GHz filter, respectively.
