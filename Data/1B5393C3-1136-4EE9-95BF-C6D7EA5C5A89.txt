Abstract
Based on communication theory, this study proposes a model to synthesize normal
and wheezing sounds. The model included five parts: the flow source as a transmitter,
the frequency and amplitude-modulated (FM-AM) sounds, the accompanying noise as
a modulator, the airway wall as a medium, and the microphone as a receiver. The
hypothesis of modulation builds on that the deviation of frequency and amplitude of
the sounds which cause from the deviation of collision speed of the air flow on the
wall. The model was successful to simulate the normal breath and wheezing sounds.
Furthermore, it provided a correct proof for the CORSA description, which indicates
that the wheeze was contained in the domain frequency at 400 Hz, but a number of
investigators have suggested that the range is actually between 80 to 1600 Hz, and 350
to 950 Hz by filter theory. This study modifies the signal source in Wodicka et al.
model, and describes it in functional blocks. In fact, the design of the signal source
base on the knowledge of the lung sound studies, especially the analysis of
components in the frequency and time domains. We synthesized the required
components to reproduce the lung sounds, and proposed a mechanism of wheeze
which was examined by the computer simulation in the points of the system
engineering view.
Introduction
Physiological signal models are a popular topic in the field of biomedical
computing because they provide a convenient way to describe, analyze, detect, and
predict the dynamic behavior of the body’s organs. Previous studies have posited 
various models for physiological signals. For example, Norian proposed an electric
model for the heart [1,2], Harper et al. modeled and measured flow effects on tracheal
sounds [3]. Hodgkin et al. [4] projected the current membrane model in the nerve.
Webster [5] described the equivalent small-length circuit of an unmyelinated nerve
fiber or skeletal muscle fiber, respectively. Reed et al. present a prototype system
intended to aid in heart sound analysis [6]. Some studies [24, 25] employed the
Windkessel models, which were the R-C and R-L-C circuit models for establishing
blood pressure. Theheart’s wide pulse pressure was regarded as the source of the
circuits. Generally, the resistors demonstrated the resistance of blood flow, and the
capacitors showed the compliance of the arteries. In fact, circuit models have been
used to describe the action potentials in the neural system, as well as the heart and
lung sounds [5]. These models are indispensable for the progression of anatomy,
physiology, chemistry, electricity, and system engineering.
Wodicka et al. [8] proposed a circuit model where the chest wall is equivalent to a
voltage source, and connects with the R-L-C circuit in series. The air cavity is
sound related to airway obstruction and several pulmonary diseases. Therefore,
considering Wodicka’s communication model, we also proposed a communication
model that functions as a frequency and amplitude modulator, highlighting the
transmission of acoustic respiratory signals. Simulated signals are indicated in the
time domain, and a spectogram was utilized to analyze the time-frequency
components. The findings of this study demonstrate that some of the parameters of the
proposed communication model correspond with the physiological characteristics of
lung sounds. The system models based on the transfer function of circuits are more
accessible and adequate to most scientific and medical professionals.
Methods
The air flowing through the airways generates lung sounds. Airflow velocity is
dependent on respiration pressure, which the neuromuscular system controls.
Therefore, this study modeled the lung as a signal source, the airway as a modulator,
the airway wall as a medium, and a microphone as the signal receiver or an oscillator,
which appears in the spectrogram as a modulated signal. The study’s hypothesis is 
based on the electronic communication system.

sounds. Therefore, theair sound’s frequency response was assumed to be uniform in
the limited band in the airway [10, 26]. However, the white noise does not exist in the
physical world. The disturbance is dependent on thesystem’s natural bandwidth that
induces the concept of band-limited white noise. The correlation time (tc) was defined
as:
             (1)
to achieve accuracy in the simulation. The     is the bandwidth of the system in
rad/s. The flow source was simulated as a 1 V and 0.5 Hz pure sine wave in the
normal breathing, and for the white noise the simulation was as a 1 V and 1 Hz sine
wave whose power was 50  W.
FM
The FM changes the carrier frequency (fc) with the amplitude of carrying
information (m(t)) linearly. Therefore, the formula of can be written as:
                      (2)
where fc denotes the carrier frequency.     is the phase deviation whose instant
frequency (fi ) can be written as:
                (3)
The linearity of the frequency deviation is shown as:
The AM’s Carrier Wave
To avoid distortion in the demodulation process, the carrier in a communication
system is usually a pure sinusoidal wave, but in this study, they are square and
triangular waves. Based on the theory of AM, the modulation variables can
demonstrate the physiological characteristics of lung sounds. Researchers can
perceive harmonics with the fundamental frequency of 200 to 500 Hz from the
acoustic signal of respiration of asthma patients [7]. The airflow associated with
respiration generates sound from the lungs. Therefore, the respiration signal can be
ideally represented as:
            (8)
where        is a periodic signal. The selection of     is dependent on the
respiration period of the subjects, among them healthy individuals, asthmatic patients,
or patients with respiratory diseases. In this study, the     was represented with a
square wave for normal breathing (  ), and a triangular wave for wheezing (  ). That
is:
      ∑                         (9)
      ∑                        (10)
where the fundamental frequency of   is 200 Hz, and   is 400 Hz, which refers
to Sovijärvi et al.’s studies [10].
Silence Control
Breathing sound is silent in expiration. During this period, the breathing noise
and sound are reduced because the flow power is too weak to generate silence in the
airway. The duration of silence is dependent on theairway’s dampness. Therefore, a
pulse generator and a first-order low-pass filter were designed to simulate the function
of damping circuits, mentioned in the Windkessel model. In fact, the transfer function
of R-C represents the characteristics of the low-pass filter.
Filtering in the Wall
This process of passing through is analogous to a trumpet [10], and has been
modeled as the L-C resonant circuit with a central frequency of 225 Hz [8].
Accordingly, this study simulates the airway wall with a second-order Butterworth
bandpass filter whose central frequency remained unchanged during normal breathing,
with a 50-Hz bandwidth. However,iregular changes of the trachea’s radius were the 
source of the wheezing. The tissue around the trachea tightened during this period.
The hypothesis states that the function of L-C energy saving disappears while
wheezing. Therefore, the filtering function of the wall was cancelled in the wheezing
model.
Results
The simulated results in Table 1 display the waveforms and spectrograms of
normal breathing and wheezing. The synthesized sound was appended to the
Appendix. The normal breathing sound was much smoother and was not as apparent
as the harmonics in the spectrogram, but the wheezing sound registered at a higher
frequency of respiration, discernable in the higher orders of the harmonics. The
normal breathing sound has been recorded and stored in the file fmamnormal1.wav,
and the wheezing sound has been saved as fmamwheeze1.wav.
The results of simulated normal breathing registered at a main frequency range
of 200 Hz. Even the AM modulation with the harmonics of 200 Hz fundamental
frequency was unclear because the bandpass filter cancelled the high frequency
components. The filter was equivalent to the L-C resonant circuit in the Wodica et al.
model.
The simulation results of wheezing registered as the worst case in frequency
response for the airway because the L-C resonant model failed to function as Wodica
et al. mentioned [8]. The CORSA indicated that the wheezing sound registered the
domain frequency at 400 Hz, but a number of investigators suggested a range of 80 to
1600 Hz, and 350 to 950 Hz [27, 28]. However, the synthesized wheezing sound
larger. However, the air flow of wheeze is narrowed and irregular, and the noise level
is reduced by the obstacle in the air way. In (d), the silent duration of normal breath is
longer than that of wheezing sound, because of the lower frequency of respiration. In
(e), the high order filter cancels the higher components in the normal breath, and the
low order filter keeps the harmonics of higher frequency.
Discussion
The model provided a correct proof for the CORSA explanation, which indicates
that the wheeze was contained in the domain frequency at 400 Hz, but a number of
investigators have suggested that the range is actually between 80 to 1600 Hz, and
350 to 950 Hz [27, 28]. The waveforms and spectrograms of the simulated wheezing
with and without the filtering are shown in Table 2. The main frequency of 400 Hz
(fmamwheeze1_sn0.wav in the Appendix) was disclosed by adding a second order
bandpass filter of 300 to 500 Hz bandwidth in the worst case. The bandpass filter in
the normal breathing model modified the filter. Stiffness of the airway wall might be a
possible reason for the differences in the main frequencies of the studies [9], [10],
[27], [28]. The benefits of the computer modeling give a very convenient approach to
explain the physiological phenomenon. This supports the FM-AM model as
approaching actual lung sound, and makes it feasible to simulate any lung sound
Modern multi-scale models show that the pulmonary airway is a branched and
slightly curved pathway. Computer simulations indicate that the speed of airflow in
the trachea is faster than in other respiration airways [15]. The airway wall is partially
elastic, which changes the airflow velocity, and the collisions of the trachea wall.
Therefore, the sound generated in the airways might be distorted. The sum of these
deviations produces the noises. The alternative junctions of inspiration and expiration
in a respiration cycle suppress the airflow to a level of bare audibility. Hence, the
silence controller was ideal in processing the acoustic signal, to be employed for the
silent periods.
Recent studies have frequently employed the multi-vector analysis to decompose
the signals, such as an artificial neural network (ANN), a wavelet, or an orthogonal
vector analysis [9], [19], [22], [23]. These methods attempt to find coefficients
belonging to specific vectors to decompose the signals. By cancelling the partially
decomposed components, noise can be reduced. Furthermore, some coefficients
support the information regarding the classification of acoustic signals, i.e.
characterization of the acoustic signals. The results aid researchers in studying the
characteristics of lung sounds, presented by the summation of the vectors. However,
this study presents lung-sound syntheses based on the physiological phenomenon to
explain the parameters in the FM-AM model. The proposed model is simple and
disorder lung sounds can be synthesized. For example, based on the air dynamics, the
geometric dimension of tube influences the different sound of air eddy. Therefore, the
noise levels and types can be mapped to reasons of disorders. In fact, the noise is one
of the dominant parameters to map the disorders. The concept was seldom mentioned
by other studies, because most of the studies cancelled the noise by various types of
filters for a clear analysis of main signals in lung sounds. Furthermore, the stiffness of
the air way decides the characteristics of filtering. The frequency response of the filter
can conclude the harmonics of the lung sound. Wodicka et al. built a fundamental
circuit model. However, our study supports the feasibilities for direct varying lung
sounds by using the parameters of the FM-AM system model of the functional block
diagrams. Based on the comparison of time and frequency components in the
spectrograms of real signals in CORSA, the simulated signals in this study prove that
the FM-AM model is feasible for application. These support the FM-AM model as
approaching actual lung sound, and make it be feasible to simulate any lung sound
cases.
Wodicka et al. model is a circuit presentation. However, our study modifies the
signal source in the model, and describes it in functional blocks. In fact, the design of
the signal source base on the knowledge of the lung sound studies, especially the
analysis of components in the frequency and time domains. We synthesized the
