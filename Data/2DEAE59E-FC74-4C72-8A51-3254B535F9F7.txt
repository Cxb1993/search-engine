In [7], the authors emphasized that a category of 
synchronization methods, which are carried out by 
crosscorrelating the received sequence and the known 
reference sequences, perform unsatisfactorily in 
wireless environments due to large value of root-mean-
squared delay spread. It proposed an algorithm to refine 
time synchronization by utilizing channel information. 
In [8], a channel estimation method for OFDM code 
division multiplex access (OFDM-CDMA) systems on 
the uplink was proposed. In this method, the training 
sequences for different users are obtained by cyclically 
shifting the same sequence. Under the assumption of 
perfect synchronization and the cyclic shift amount is 
larger than the duration of channel impulse response 
(CIR), the CIR for each user will align in the time axis 
without overlap through discrete Fourier transform 
(DFT) and inverse-DFT operations. 
It is to our knowledge that the training sequence 
design that contributes to both synchronization and 
channel estimation is scarcely investigated in MIMO-
OFDM systems. In this report, we extend the training 
sequence structure developed in the first-year work of 
the project [9] into MIMO scenario. The proposed 
extension will be shown to be beneficial to both 
synchronization and channel estimation in MIMO-
OFDM systems. Unlike the training sequence structure 
described in [1], the proposed one can be constructed 
from the same orthogonal sequence. By appending the 
same orthogonal sequence with carefully-chosen 
amount of cyclic prefix and postfix, the mutual 
interference among training sequences will be 
eliminated. With the proposed structure, the CIR of each 
transmit-receive branch will align in the time axis 
without overlap through crosscorrelating the received 
training sequence and the original orthogonal sequence. 
This key feature enables us to achieve time 
synchronization and channel estimation jointly in time-
domain for MIMO-OFDM systems.

3.1 The Kernel of a Joint Time Synchronization and 
Channel Estimation Scheme 
In this section, we summarize the key concepts of the 
joint time synchronization and channel estimation 
scheme proposed in the first-year project [9]. The effect 
of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is 
temporarily dropped for clarity. 
3.1.1 The Training Sequence Structure 
The training sequence is composed of an orthogonal 
sequence attached by both cyclic prefix and postfix as 
depicted in Fig. 1. A sequence is called orthogonal if 
and only if its autocorrelation function is a delta 
function. Let gP=[g(0), g(1), …, g(P−1)] denote the 
orthogonal sequence, and g(n)=g(n+P) for n=−M, 
−M+1, …, P−M−1 represent the cyclic extensions. Both 
the lengths of the cyclic extensions are chosen to be 
longer than the number of effective taps of the sample-
spaced CIR denoted by hL=[h(0), h(1), …, h(L−1)]. 
Since we have M >L−1 and P−M >L−1, the selection of 
the length of the orthogonal sequence will be dependent 
on the number of effective taps of the sample-spaced 
CIR and must satisfy the following inequality 
2( 1).P L> −                                    (1) 
By appending sufficiently long cyclic extensions to the 
original orthogonal sequence, part of the received 
sequence can be modeled as the cyclic convolution of 
the CIR and the orthogonal sequence. It can be 
expressed as

represents the operation of modulo P. 
Since the autocorrelation between an orthogonal 
sequence and any of its cyclically-shifted versions is 
zero, the CIR information can be obtained by 
crosscorrelating the received training sequence and the 
original orthogonal sequence. Consequently, we have

As we can see, based on the training sequence 
structure, the crosscorrelation function between the 
received training sequence and the original orthogonal 
sequence will contain a segment that perfectly matches 
the CIR. In addition, this desired segment will be 
guarded by leading and tailing zeros, and therefore can 
be clearly identified.

3.1.2 The Joint Time Synchronization and Channel 
Estimation Scheme 
With the special training sequence structure, time 
synchronization and channel estimation can be jointly 
accomplished by the following steps: 
for 1,  ,  ,  d M L M L P M= − + − − + −… . As we can 
see, the CIR of each transmit-receive branch is now 
aligned and spaced by zeros in the correlator output, and 
therefore can be separated and extracted. Unlike the 
method described in [8], which involves DFT and IDFT, 
the proposed one utilizes correlation that is done solely 
in the time-domain. 
The general form of the proposed training sequence 
structure for MIMO systems with NT transmit-antennas 
is shown in Fig. 3. For each transmit-antenna, the 
training sequence is constructed from the same 
orthogonal sequence attached by pre-selected amount of 
cyclic extensions. Since each cyclic extension is chosen 
to be longer than the number of effective taps of the 
wireless channel, we have M >L−1 and P− NT M >L−1. 
Consequently, the selection of the length of the 
orthogonal sequence will be dependent on L and NT. It 
must satisfy the following inequality 
( )1 ( 1).TP N L> + −                              (8) 
It should be noted that the proposed training 
sequence structure for MIMO systems differs from the 
one described in [1] in several aspects. First, the 
proposed one can be constructed from the same 
orthogonal sequence, while the one compared requires 
NT different orthogonal sequences. Second, the 
proposed one eliminates the interference among training 
sequences transmitted by different antennas as long as 
(8) is satisfied, while the one compared introduces more 
mutual interference as NT increases. Third, the 
fundamental element of the proposed one is an 
orthogonal sequence attached by both cyclic prefix and 
postfix, while that of the one compared is an orthogonal 
sequence appended by cyclic prefix only. 
3.2.3  The Proposed Joint Time Synchronization and 
Channel Estimation Scheme for MIMO-OFDM 
Systems 
From the proposed training sequence structure and 
the derivation in (7), we can infer that the CIRs of 
different transmit-receive branches will align in non-
overlapped regions of the correlator output. Each of 
these regions has M samples, the cyclic shift amount 
between training sequences adopted by adjacent 
transmit-antennas. Consequently, after the correlator 
output has been properly separated into sequential M-
sample regions based on some coarse timing 
information, the CIR of each transmit-receive branch 
and the corresponding time synchronization instant can 
be estimated jointly through the method described in 
section II-B within each region. 
In MIMO-OFDM systems, however, the effect of 
carrier frequency offset (CFO) should be taken into 
account. In this case, the sequence received by the jth 
antenna is modeled as 
( ) ( ) ( )2j n Nj j jr n y n e w nπε= ⋅ +                     (9) 
where N represents the number of OFDM subcarriers, ε 
denotes the CFO normalized to the OFDM subcarrier 
spacing, and w j(n) describes the AWGN. It should be 
noted that the training pattern for each transmit-antenna 
is additionally designed to contain two identical halves 
and each has a length of P. Consequently, conventional 
synchronization techniques for OFDM systems that 
based on time-domain repetition structures of the 
training sequences can be directly applied to perform 
coarse time synchronization and CFO estimation. Once 
a reference time has been obtained from the coarse time 
synchronization process and the effect of the CFO has 
also been properly handled, the received and 
compensated training sequence can be viewed as {yj(n)} 
garbled by slight residual CFO and AWGN. In other 
word, the above-mentioned approach can now be 
utilized to acquire CIR information of different 
transmit-receive branches along with the corresponding 
time synchronization instants. 
 
3.3 Simulation Results 
During computer simulations, we applied the 
multipath Rayleigh fading channel model described in 
[10] to generate the CIR of each transmit-receive branch 
independently. Each CIR is modeled by complex 
samples where the average power of them decays 
exponentially. Each of these samples has uniformly-
distributed phase and Rayleigh-distributed amplitude. 
The CIR of the ijth transmit-receive branch at delay k is 
modeled as

where ( )20,  2kN σ  denotes a zero mean Gaussian 
random variable with variance 2 2kσ , Ts is the 
sampling period, and TRMS is the root-mean-squared 
delay spread of the channel. By setting Ts/TRMS=1/2, the 
number of effective taps (L) was chosen to be 
10⋅(TRMS/Ts)=20 to provide the tail of the simulated CIR 
with sufficient decay. In addition, we assumed that each 
transmit-receive branch experienced the same CFO, 
which is uniformly distributed within 1± subcarrier 
spacing. 
The training sequence structure described in [1] was 
used for both the methods compared [1], [8]. In this 
training structure, the length of each modulatable 
orthogonal sequence was chosen to be 169 and the 
cyclic prefix attached was fixed to 87 samples. On the 
other hand, a different length of the modulatable 
orthogonal sequence was adopted to form the proposed 
training sequence structure with parameters P=256, and 
M=64. In other words, the length of the proposed 
training sequence for each transmit-antenna is fixed to 
512 samples, while that of the one compared [1] are set 
to 512 and 768 samples in the 2×2 and 3×3 cases, 
respectively. It should be noted that the cases denoted 
by “MIMO” neglect the effect of CFO, while the cases 
denoted by “MIMO-OFDM” follow the system model 
described in (9) and require coarse time synchronization 
and CFO estimation. For the fairness of comparison, the

be obtained before the synchronization stage. 
In this report, we propose a joint time 
synchronization and channel estimation scheme for 
OFDM systems based on a novel training sequence 
structure. The kernel of the proposed training sequence 
structure is an orthogonal sequence. By attaching 
sufficiently long cyclic prefix and cyclic postfix to the 
orthogonal sequence, the cross-correlation function 
between the received training sequence and the original 
orthogonal sequence will contain a segment that 
matches the channel impulse response guarded by 
leading and tailing zeros. This special feature enables 
the proposed joint approach to be simple and effective.

As we can see, by attaching both (L–1)-point cyclic 
prefix and cyclic postfix to an orthogonal sequence, a 
segment of the cross-correlation function between the 
received sequence and the original orthogonal sequence 
will contain a segment that coincides with the channel 
impulse response. In other words, the corresponding 
correlator output will contain both information for time 
synchronization and channel estimation. 
3.1.3 The Proposed Training Sequence Structure 
In order to make the proposed training sequence more 
suitable to OFDM systems, we adopt the modulatable 
orthogonal sequences [8] as the kernel of the proposed 
training sequence. The modulatable orthogonal 
sequence is a polyphase sequence with constant 
amplitude, hence it achieves the smallest peak-to-
average power ratio (PAPR), i.e., 0 dB. Since the 
proposed training sequence is exactly an orthogonal 
sequence appended by its corresponding cyclic prefix 
and cyclic postfix, it is also a polyphase sequence and 
shares the same PAPR property. In other words, the 
proposed training sequence will experience the slightest 
distortion caused by imperfections of high power 
amplifiers. 
As depicted in (4), a segment of the correlator output 
will coincide with the channel impulse response as long 
as both (L–1)-point cyclic prefix and cyclic postfix are 
attached to the original orthogonal sequence. However, 
longer cyclic prefix and cyclic postfix are required in 
order to identify which segment of the correlator output 
represents the channel impulse response. By extending 
both cyclic prefix and cyclic postfix beyond (L–1) 
points, the corresponding correlator output will contain 
not only a segment that matches the channel impulse 
decides where to place the N-point DFT window for 
demodulation. Once the carrier frequency offset has 
been estimated according to the result of coarse time 
synchronization, the entire received sequence is 
properly adjusted to compensate for the effect of carrier 
frequency offset. Since a reference time has been 
obtained from the coarse time synchronization process 
and the effect of carrier frequency offset has also been 
handled, the received and compensated training 
sequence ˆ[ ]y n can be viewed as y[n] garbled by residual 
carrier frequency offset and noise. We can then 
calculate the cross-correlation function between the 
received and compensated training sequence ˆ[ ]y n and 
the original orthogonal sequence ( [ ]Rˆ d ) within a 
proper observation range analogously as described in 
(6). According to previous discussions, the 
corresponding correlator output will contain a segment 
that approximates to the channel impulse response. In 
addition, this particular region will also be guarded by 
leading and tailing zeros garbled by noise. Therefore, 
the proposed joint fine time synchronization and 
channel estimation scheme can be accomplished by the 
following phases:

the estimated channel impulse response. 
The entire process of the proposed joint approach is 
also illustrated in Fig. 3. It should be noted that the 
threshold α represents a ratio of the estimated channel 
gain of the channel’s strongest path (hmax). For each 
timing instant d < d0 such that the absolute value of [ ]Rˆ d  is greater than or equal to hmax⋅α , the timing 
instant d will be considered to be within the desired 
region where [ ]Rˆ d  matches the corresponding channel 
impulse response h[d]. 
 
3.3 SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The performance of the proposed joint time 
synchronization and channel estimation scheme is tested 
in a multipath Rayleigh fading channel described in [10], 
which is adopted by the IEEE 802.11 Working Group 
for software simulations. The channel is modeled by 
complex samples where the average power of these 
samples decays exponentially. Each of these samples 
has uniformly distributed phase and Rayleigh 
distributed amplitude. The kth path of the channel is 
modeled as

where ( )20,  / 2kN σ  denotes a zero mean Gaussian 
random variable with variance 2 / 2kσ , Ts is the sampling 
period, and TRMS is the root-mean-squared delay spread 
of the channel. In order to provide the tail of the 
simulated channel impulse response with sufficient 
decay, the number of paths (L) is chosen to be 
10⋅(TRMS/Ts). 
The channel model was assumed to be quasi-
stationary, i.e., the channel characteristics remain 
unchanged during the transmission of an entire OFDM 
packet. However, the channel used for simulation is 
generated independently from one packet to another. In 
our simulations, we set Ts/TRMS=1 to generate 10-path 
Rayleigh fading channels. A carrier frequency offset 
that uniformly distributed within 0.5± subcarrier spacing 
is also introduced independently from one packet to 
another. We chose P=7 to form the proposed training 
sequence and set the threshold α to be 0.125. In order to 
simulate the performance of some conventional methods, 
another dedicated training sequence, which can be used 
to perform both the Minn’s synchronization method [6] 
and the DFT-based channel estimation method [9], is 
required. The training sequence (excluding cyclic prefix) 
contains two identical halves where each has 32 samples. 
In addition, 16 samples of cyclic prefix are appended to 
make the entire training sequence contain 80 samples. 
The structure of OFDM symbols within the transmitted 
packet followed the same specifications described in [1]. 
In frequency domain, each OFDM symbol contains 64 
subcarriers where 48 of them are used to transmit 
QPSK-modulated data symbols and 4 of them are 
specified to transmit known pilot symbols. These pilot 
symbols can be extracted after OFDM demodulation to 
perform carrier phase tracking. In the time domain, each 
OFDM symbol is appended by 16 samples of cyclic 
prefix. 
The performance of the proposed joint time 
synchronization and channel estimation scheme is 
evaluated in several aspects. First, simulation results of 
the proposed approach and the methods compared are 
demonstrated in Figs. 4 and 5 in terms of the means and 
variances of the corresponding time estimators versus
