evaluate mechanical properties of the films 
in the structures, being such properties 
critical for the feasibility and performance 
of the systems [8]. Then, accurate 
measurements can only be achieved by 
miniaturizing the test probe to a size 
approaching the film thickness and the 
microstructures dimensions. Thus it is need 
to use very high and novel techniques to 
ensure real mechanical properties for 
advanced systems. It is also known that the 
intermolecular forces exist between the tip 
and the surface and it will cause deflection 
of the micro-cantilever. A basic problem in 
designing AFM micro-cantilever is to 
determine the equilibrium in the atomic 
force field. Some researches [9-11] had 
studied the problems. The deflection curves 
are calculated based on the basic beam 
theory and the stability of the equilibrium 
is calculated via the energy method. 
Though the related literatures are very 
comprehensive, some assumptions are 
performed in order to simplify the 
simulation model and economize 
simulation time. The assumptions may lead 
some errors comparing with real state. In 
this research analyzes, we consider the 
nonlinear dynamic responses of 
micro-cantilever beam for atomic force 
microscope with nonlinear suspension and 
also takes the laser-induced force into 
consideration. The nonlinear dynamic 
equations are solved using the fourth 
ordered Runge-Kutta method. The dynamic 
trajectories, power spectrum, Poincaré 
maps and bifurcation diagrams are applied 
to analyze dynamic motions. 
We all also know that it is hard to 
define the mechanical properties of 
cantilever beam of the atomic force 
microscope and the related researches are 
also very exiguous. In this study, we 
present a novel method to determine the 
Young’s Modulus of micro-cantilever 
composite bi-layer beam and tri-layer beam. 
Though the laser force is seemed much 
smaller than the intermolecular force, we 
also take it into consideration. The thermal 
noise effect is also taken into account. We 
also calculated the equilibrium 
configurations based on the 
Bernoulli-Euler beam theory.

   According to the formulation results, 
the distribution of Elastic Modulus in 
rectangular beam and triangular beam of 
composite bi-layer beam and tri-layer beam 
are illustrated in Figs.4 and 5, respectively. 
Both of the two cases show that the elastic 
modulus of micro-cantilever beam changes 
with the value of deflection. Besides it also 
demonstrated that the elastic modulus is 
different for different micro-cantilever  
beam shapes.

The bifurcation diagram in Figure 8, 9 
and 10 are plotted with displacement 
against the dimensionless value s for 
Q=200, 300 and 400 respectively. 
Qualitatively different behavior was 
observed at values of s within the range of 
0.6 to 1.0 and they can provide global 
dynamic responses for the system. 
Q=200~400, i.e. AFM is used in the air, 
will make the damping ratio term of 
nonlinear dynamic equation to become 
smaller and the system will absorb 
vibration energy. The numerical results 
show that the dynamic responses are 
unstable and non-periodic for different 
values of s. There are abundant 
non-periodic motions happening in the 
system. The result can be concluded that 
the more value of Q is, the more unstable 
the system will become. Q=1~5, i.e. AFM 
is used in the water; the dynamic orbits will 
be more stable and maintain periodic for 
almost all values of s.  
(14) 
   The nonlinear suspension effect and 
nonlinear tip-sample interaction force 
effect make equation (14) to become a 
strongly nonlinear dynamic equation. The 
dynamic response of this system varied 
with dimensionless parameter s and 
parameter  would also be presented and 
discussed in this study. The fourth order 
Runge-Kutta method is applied to carry out 
the numerical analysis. These numerical 
data are then used to generate the dynamic 
trajectories, power spectrum, Poincaré 
maps and bifurcation diagrams.

5.  Numerical studies 
 
Figure 11 to 32 are the dynamic orbits, 
power spectrum and Poincaré maps in 
different values of s respectively. Almost of 
the dynamic trajectories are irregular 
except s=0.72 and 0.82. It can be simply 
identify that it is 5T-periodic and 
4T-periodic at s=0.72 and 0.82 from 
dynamic orbits respectively. We cannot get 
enough information or identify when 
dynamic trajectories are disorder and 
irregular. Therefore, we must take other 
methods to prove whether it is 
quasi-periodic motion or chaotic motion 
and then the power spectrum and Poincaré 
section maps will be applied to diagnose 
dynamic responses later. 
   It can be seen that there are five 
discrete points and four discrete points in 
the Poincaré maps at s=0.72 and 0.82 
respectively, and It is found that the 
frequency response of the tip behaves with 
subharmonic motion of 5T-period and 
4T-period at the speed s=0.72 and 0.82 
respectively. It can be concluded that 
dynamic response will be 5T-periodic 
motion at s=0.72, but become 4T-periodic 
motion at s=0.82. The results also show 
that the dynamic is quasi-periodic at s=0.6, 
0.62, 0.7, 0.74, 0.76, 0.78, 0.8, 0.81, 0.84, 
0.86, 0.88, 0.94, 0.96 and 0.98 from 
Poincaré section maps, and the orbit is 
3T-periodic at s=1.0 and it may be chaotic 
response. The Poincaré map of chaotic
