ability [1]-[2]. The deign of controller for a 
PWM ac/dc boost converter is to maintain the 
dc-bus at a desired level with almost sinusoidal 
supply currents that is in phase with supply 
phase voltage, i.e. unity power factor. In a 
balanced three phase system, it is favorable to 
perform controller design in synchronous d-q 
coordinate since the variables to be controlled 
is reduced form three to two. As quoted in 
recent research reports [3]-[5], one also has to 
take care the nonlinearity introduced in the 
control input variables for achieving non-local 
performance. Based on nonlinear control theory, 
several control design have been done. 
Komurcugil and Kukrer [3] synthesize a 
globally stable controller based on the 
Lyapunov direct method [6]. As the controller 
realization requires positions of the equilibrium 
points at steady state, which depend on circuit 
parameters and load resistance, there may exist 
steady-state errors in the state variables. 
Vilathgamuwa et al. [7] adopt a two-time-scale 
approach to conduct sliding mode technique, in 
which dc-bus voltage dynamics are indirectly 
regulated once sliding modes occur. Conditions 
for global stability were derived, but the 
simulation results show that the resulting 
closed-loop system does not guarantee zero 
steady-state error in tracking constant voltage 
reference. Hence, further improvement to 
remedy this flaw is necessary. The 
non-minimum phase feature of the PWM boost 
converters is an obstacle for those designs that 
require inversion of system model. In linear 
setting, non-minimum phase means that the 
system has unstable zero. This notion has also 
been generalized to nonlinear system by 
identifying the stability of the zero dynamics 
[6]. 
As a result, several investigations (cf. [4] 
and reference cited therein) have been done on 
applying feedback linearization to the control 
of PWM ac/dc boost converter. In the research 
of [4], a detailed analysis on the feedback 
linearizability of the ac/dc boost converter also 
confirms that when the outputs are connected 
by dc-bus voltage and q-axis current, the ac/dc 
boost converter becomes a non-minimum phase 
system from a nonlinear system point of view. 
Hence direct nonlinear control of dc-bus 
voltage is not possible and an indirect approach 
was adopted. Also, to avoid the singularities 
and cancellation of the “workless force” terms 
in control algorithm, a nonlinear feedback 
design based on passivity-based control 
methodology is presented in [5]. A 
passivity-based PI control design developed 
based on port-controlled Hamiltonian is 
recently reported by Perez et al. [8]. These 
approaches control the output voltage in an 
indirect manner and the robust performance 
under parameter perturbation and external 
disturbance is not assured. In contrast, a state 
feedback design via extended linearization is 
reported in [9] for achieving direct dc-bus 
voltage capability. Although a fast tracking 
response is accomplished by this design, the 
lack of integral action in control loop makes 
the system suffer from the robustness issue. 
The ∞H  control methodology has long 
been recognized as a useful tool in 
counteracting external disturbances and model 
uncertainties. More importantly, it is applicable 
to non-minimum phase system and the desired 
robustness may be incorporated in the 
controller design. This approach entails the 
formulation of the control objectives in terms 
of the ∞H -gain ( 2L -gain) [10] constraint from 
the exogenous inputs to the penalty outputs on 
a so called generalized plant. Successful 
implementations of this type of control design 
have been reported in various industrial 
applications such as induction motors [11], 
robot arms [12] and switching power 
converters [13].  
This report presents the design of a 
nonlinear ∞H  controller for three-phase 
PWM ac/dc boost converter. The 
unity-power-factor and output dc-bus 
regulation problem are formulated in a 
nonlinear ∞H  control framework. The control 
objectives such as insensitivity in circuit 
parameters and load disturbance are expressed 
via a L2-gain requirement on the generalized 
plant. Motivated from the passivity results for 
the ac/dc converters [5] and the work of Kugi 
and Schlacher [13] for dc/dc converters, the 
solution of the HJI can be found by considering 
the energy storage function candidate. Since 
the solution is qualified to be a Lyapunov 
function, the stability of the closed loop is also 
established along the standard Lyapunov 
criterion. As in [13], an integral action is 
incorporated in the control loop to enhance 
robustness under uncertainties, but this leads to 
be derived as

The control and penalty variables are 
defined in (13) and (15), respectively. Now, for 
the generalized error equation (16), the 
objective is to find a state feedback law, 
)(zαv = , so that the closed-loop system is 
stable and the ∞H  performance (8) is satisfied 
for a given positive number γ . The block 
diagram of the ∞H  control formulation for the 
three-phase ac/sc boost converter is shown in 
Fig. 3. 
B. ∞H  Controller Synthesis 
Since the generized plant (16) is of 
nonlinear nature, the synthesis of the ∞H  
controller must be undertaken in the nonlinear 
framework. For a given positive number γ , 
the results in [10] reveal that the nonlinear ∞H  
controller may be constructed via the solution

四、模擬與實作結果 
I. Simulation Results 
To demonstrate the performance of the 
proposed controller, the system was simulated 
using ‘SimPowerSystems’ in Matlab/Simulink. 
The specification and circuit parameters used 
in the simulation are listed in Table 1. As the 
simulation results are in close agreement with 
those in experiment, these simulated 
waveforms are omitted. 
II. Experimental Results 
For demonstrating the validity of proposed 
approach, an experimental system with the 
specification and circuit parameters listed in 
Table 1 was built in the laboratory. Figure 4 
displays the nonlinear ∞H  controller structure 
and hardware configuration in the experiment. 
A personal computer (PC) equipped with 
data-acquisition boards was used to realize the 
control algorithm. The CPU of the PC is 
Pentium III running at a clock speed of 1GHz. 
For the controller, all measured signal inputs 
and control signal outputs are interfaced with 
PWM rectifier via 12-b multi-channel 
analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog 
(D/A) converters whose conversion times are 
1μs and 5μs per channel, respectively. The 
sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) strategy is employed 
to generate the switching pattern. The control 
signals, cjv , , , , cbaj =  fed into the SPWM 
are transformed from switching functions jp , 
j=a,b,c, through the following formula [4] 
,jtricj pvv ×=   .,, c b aj =     (30) 
where triv  stands for the amplitude of the 
triangular PWM carrier. The d-axis current 
command *dI  was limited to within [-20, 20] 
to prevent the damage of circuit devices from 
over current. The sampling period in this setup 
was 100μs and a simple zero-order Euler 
approximation was used to digitize the control 
law. The parameter values of the proposed 
nonlinear ∞H  controller are chosen as 
.0501 =λ , .0160221 =λk  and 0.53 =λ . 
Experiments on the step changes in both 
dc-bus voltage reference and load were 
conducted. For the set-point change in voltage 
reference from 120V to 180V and back to 120V, 
the responses of the dc voltage and d-q axis 
currents are depicted in Fig. 5. It shows that the 
asymptotic tracking error is reduced to an 
almost invisible level due to the integral action. 
Figure 6 documents the responses of the dc 
voltage, load current and d-q axis currents for a 
step change in dc load current from 1.8A to 
4.5A with a fixed dc voltage reference set at 
180V. The steady-state phase currents and 
voltage on the ac side are shown in Fig. 7, 
which confirm that the power factor is almost 
unity and the source currents are nearly a 
sinusoidal wave. The measured THD of the 
supply current is about 5%. These results 
evidence the salient performance of the 
proposed design.
