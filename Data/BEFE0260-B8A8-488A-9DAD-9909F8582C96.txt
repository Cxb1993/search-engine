Abstract 
Few studies have measured polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans 
(PBDD/Fs) in the atmosphere. In this study, four categories of atmospheric environments, 
including rural (Kengting national park, Taitung county, and Yilan county), urban (north 
Kaohsiung city and south Taichung city), industrial (Lin-hai industrial park), and science 
park (Hsinchu science park) areas were investigated for their characteristics of 
2,3,7,8-substituted PBDD/F and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans 
(PCDD/Fs). The elevated PCDD/F I-TEQ concentrations and higher ratio of PCDFs to 
PCDDs in the industrial areas reveal that the metallurgical facilities, including sinter plants, 
electric arc furnaces, secondary aluminum smelters, and secondary copper smelters, 
significantly influence their surrounding atmospheric environments. The mean PBDD/F 
concentrations in the atmosphere of the rural, urban, industrial, and science park areas were 
11, 24, 46, and 95 fg/Nm3, respectively, while the corresponding mean TEQ concentrations 
were 2.7, 6.4, 12, and 31 fg TEQ/Nm3, respectively. The significantly high correlation (r= 
0.85, p= 0.034) found between the PBDD/F and PCDD/F concentrations in the atmospheres 
of the industrial areas reveals that the metallurgical facilities are also the most likely PBDD/F 
emission sources in the industrial areas. The PBDD/F concentration in the science park area 
was ~two-fold higher than that in the industrial areas, whereas PCDD/F I-TEQ concentration

Introduction 
Concerns about polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) have 
increased because brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are extensively used in a variety of 
materials and are miscible with most plastics. Several potential routes for the release of 
PBDD/Fs into the environment have been proposed, including formation in the process of 
manufacturing BFRs, formation during the processing of BFRs with polymer resin, and 
incinerating waste which contains BFRs (1-3). Commercial mixtures of polybrominated 
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) contain PBDFs as impurities at contents ranging from 257 ng/g to 
49600 ng/g, indicating that the use of PBDE mixtures can contribute to the direct emission of 
PBDFs into the environment (3). PBDDs were not detected at levels above the limit of 
detection (3). However, few studies have investigated the 2,3,7,8-substituted PBDD/F 
emission from the potential routes above. Our recent research has characterized 
2,3,7,8-substituted PBDD/Fs in the stack flue gases of full scale municipal solid waste 
incinerators (MSWIs) and several kinds of industrial waste incinerators (IWIs) (4). The 
concentration of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in the 
stack flue gases of IWIs (0.0128-0.897 ng I-TEQ/Nm3) and MSWIs (0.0171-1.98 ng 
I-TEQ/Nm3) are in the same range. However, the elevated PBDD/F concentrations (18.2

Another study reported that the concentration of PBDD/Fs (sum of 11 congeners) (n=1) in the 
atmosphere from the Osaka district was only 0.036 pg/m3 (27).  
In this study, the 2,3,7,8-substituted PBDD/F and PCDD/F characteristics in the 
atmosphere of rural, urban, industrial, and science park areas were investigated. The mass 
and TEQ ratios of the PBDD/F to PCDD/F concentrations in different atmospheric 
environments are presented and compared. Furthermore, the congener profiles of PBDD/Fs 
and PCDD/Fs in the different atmospheric environments are discussed to reveal the possible 
emission sources. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Sampling Areas. Air samples were collected from rural (R1-R5), urban (U1-U7), industrial 
(I1-I5), and science park areas (S1-S2) during July, 2004 - November, 2005. Each area 
included 2-5 atmosphere sampling sites to obtain good representative samples and enough 
PBDD/F for analyses. The sampling information is detailed in Table S1 of the Supporting 
Information (SI), which shows that the atmospheric temperature and pressure during 
atmosphere sampling were between 18 °C and 31 °C and between 754 mm Hg and 764 mm 
 8
Sampling Procedures. All the ambient air samplings and chemical analyses in this study 
were carried out by our accredited laboratory in Taiwan. Each ambient air sample was 
collected using a PS-1 sampler (Graseby Andersen, GA, USA) according to revised EPA 
Reference Method TO9A. The sampling flow rate was specified at ~0.225 m3/min. Each 
sample was collected continuously for three consecutive days (sampling volume= 972 m3). 
The PS-1 sampler was equipped with a quartz-fiber filter for sampling particulate-phase 
PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs, and a glass cartridge for sampling gas-phase PCDD/Fs and 
PBDD/Fs. The sampled air volumes were normalized to the standard condition of 760 mm 
Hg and 298 K, and denoted as Nm3. Because the ranges of the atmospheric temperature and 
pressure during the atmosphere sampling were small, the change of the PCDD/F 
concentrations due to the normalization was less 1%. Some occasional events, like open 
burning of the agricultural waste (29) and the Asian sand storm (30), were avoided during 
atmosphere sampling. 
 
Analytical Procedures. To measure both the PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs, after the extraction of 
the ambient air samples, the extracted solution was divided equally into flasks A and flasks B. 
All the A flasks were measured for PCDD/Fs individually. For the PBDD/F measurement, all 
the B flasks from the same investigated area were combined into one because of the detection 
 10
13C12-1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF and 13C12-1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF. The recoveries of PCDD/F 
surrogate standards were 92%-115%, which met the criteria of 70%-130%, and reveal that no 
PCDD/F breakthrough occurred. Because no PBDD/F surrogate standards could be 
purchased, the sampler collection efficiency check for PBDD/Fs used the recoveries of the 
corresponding PCDD/F surrogate standards. The recoveries of PCDD/F internal standards, 
which were added to the samples before extraction, for the tetra- through hexa-chlorinated 
homologues were between 63% and 101 %, which met the criteria of being within 
40%-130%, while those for the hepta- and octachlorinated homologues were between 56 % 
and 104 %, which met the criteria of being within 25%-130%. The recoveries of PBDD/F 
internal standards were between 55% and 114 %, which met the criteria of being within 
40%-130%. The recoveries of PCDD/F Precision and Recovery (PAR) standards, which were 
conducted for each sample batch, were 86%-123%, while those of PBDD/Fs PAR standards 
were 84%-118%, both meeting the criteria of being within 70%-130%. The limit of detection 
(LOD) in this study was defined as a signal-to-noise (S/N) greater than three, while the limit 
of quantification (LOQ) was defined as an S/N greater than ten. We had participated in the 
first round of the international intercalibration for PBDD/Fs and PBCDD/Fs in 2004. The 
result revealed that the performance of our method was acceptable for PBDD/F analysis.

PCDD/F sources. The PCDD/F concentrations in the rural areas (29 fg I-TEQ/Nm3) of the 
present study were about 2-5 times higher than those (6.4 to 15.4 fg I-TEQ/m3) found in the 
United States. 
The mean PCDD/F I-TEQ concentration in the industrial area was 5.0-(=0.15/0.029), 
2.5-(=0.15/0.060), and 4.4-(=0.15/0.033) times higher than those of the rural, urban, and 
science park areas, respectively. The elevated PCDD/F I-TEQ concentration in the industrial 
area was attributed to the PCDD/F emissions from the metallurgical facilities, including 
EAFs, secondary ALSs, and sinter plants after conducting the principal component analyses 
and indicatory PCDD/F comparison (12).  
PBDD/F concentrations. Because the toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) have not been 
determined for PBDD/Fs, the I-TEFs of PCDD/Fs were used for the corresponding congeners 
of PBDD/Fs (4, 32-35) to calculate their toxicity in the atmosphere. The PBDD/F 
concentrations and the corresponding ratios (in percentage) of the PBDD/F to PCDD/F 
concentrations in the atmosphere of the rural, urban, industrial, and science park areas are 
shown in Table 2. More detailed data in each investigated area are listed in Tables S5-S8 of 
the SI. The mean PBDD/F mass concentrations (sum of 7 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners) in 
the atmosphere of the rural, urban, industrial, and science park areas were 11 (range: 3.4 – 20, 
RSD: 61%), 24 (range: 15 – 30, RSD: 22%), 46 (range: 28 – 58, RSD: 29%) and 95 fg/Nm3 
 14
sources in the industrial area are similar, and are likely from the metallurgical facilities. 
However, no study was conducted on the PBDD/F characteristics in the stack flue gases of 
the metallurgical facilities, such as EAFs, secondary ALSs, and sinter plants.  
The PBDD/F concentration in the science park area was 2.1-(=95/46) fold on a mass basis 
and 2.5-(=31/12) fold on a toxicity basis higher than that of the industrial areas, whereas the 
PCDD/F I-TEQ concentration in the science park area was only 23% of that of the industrial 
areas. We speculated that the elevated PBDD/F concentrations in the science park area may 
be attributed to the use of PBDEs as BFRs in the electrical and electronics industries, which 
contribute to direct PBDD/F emission into the environment (3). Due to limitations in both 
cost and manpower, PBDEs in the atmosphere were not measured in this study. However, 
Chen et al. (36) observed substantially higher PBDE concentrations in the atmosphere 
(PBDD/Fs were not measured) of an area with a cluster of electronic/electrical equipment, 
plastics, and automobile manufacturing industries. The combined results of this study and 
that of Chen et al. (36) seem to be comparable with the results that obtained by Hayakawa et 
al. (24), which showed that the PBDD/F concentrations in the atmosphere correlated 
positively with PBDEs in Kyoto, Japan (24). 
The mean ratios (in percentage) of the PBDD/F to PCDD/F concentrations in the 
atmosphere of the rural, urban, industrial, and science park areas were 1.8% (range: 1.1% – 
 16
TEQ contribution of the coplanar PCBs ranged from 5.0% to 9.4% of the PCDD/F I-TEQ 
contribution for the ambient air samples taken at an urban site, a rural site, and two village 
sites, which relied on domestic burning for space heating in northwest England (9). 
Kurokawa et al. (37) also reported similar results; the ratio was about 4.9% in the atmosphere 
of three urban sites. Consequently, the TEQ contribution of PBDD/Fs in the atmosphere is 
comparable to that of coplanar PCBs, except in the science park areas. 
PCDD/F and PBDD/F congener profiles. The congener profiles of the seventeen 2,3,7,8 
chlorinated substituted PCDD/Fs and the seven 2,3,7,8 brominated substituted PBDD/Fs 
(mean±SD) detected in the atmosphere are shown in Figure 2. The profiles were calculated 
according to the fraction (%) of each congener to the total PCDD/F mass concentration (or 
total PBDD/Fs). The PCDD/F congener profiles of the rural, urban, industrial, and science 
park areas show that the most abundant congeners in the atmosphere were 1,2,3,4,6,7,8- 
HpCDD, OCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8- HpCDF, and OCDF, which are consistent with those found in 
other studies (10, 38-39). However, the PCDD/F congener profiles obtained in this study are 
different from those in rural and remote areas of the United States (8), in which the PCDD/F 
patterns were a consequence of the atmospheric “weathering” effect. They found that 
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD (10%-11%) and OCDD (36%-37%) dominated the congener profile, 
while 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF and OCDF only represented 1.9%-2.7% and 2%-6% of the total 
 18
by PBDFs (4). Consequently, MSWIs are less significant PBDD/F emission sources 
compared to others.
