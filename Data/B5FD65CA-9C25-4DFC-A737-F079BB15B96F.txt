lower PAPR compared to the LFDMA system [3,18], it 
suffers from much more performance loss in the 
presence of carrier frequency offset and channel 
estimation error [4-5]. Hence, the 3GPP LTE standard 
adopted the SC-LFDMA for 4G uplink system. 
Compared to OFDMA, the SC-LFDMA waveform 
has a much lower PAPR, but shares a similar 
implementation complexity and robustness against 
highly dispersive channels. Besides the commonly used 
frequency-domain Linear Equalization (FD-LE), 
SC-LFDMA can employ FD Decision Feedback 
Equalization (FD-DFE) to cancel the residual cyclic ISI. 
Therefore, FD-DFE offers a superior uncoded 
performance than that of conventional FD-LE. However, 
when incorrect decisions are made, DFEs behave poorly 
due to error propagation, particularly for coded 
modulation. Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) 
[8-9] overcomes the above shortcoming by moving the 
time-domain (TD) feedback filter from receiver to 
transmitter and is thus error free. Furthermore, it is easy 
to combine THP with channel coding. Motivated by this 
result, a new SC-LFDMA uplink transmission scheme is 
recently proposed in [11] and referred to as 
TD-THP-FDE, assuming that the transmitter has the 
required feedback information from the base station. It 
consists of a pre-DFT TD-FD-THP at the transmitter 
and an FDE at the receiver, whose coefficients are 
derived based on the MMSE criterion [6]. To mitigate 
ISI by using THP in uplink transmission, two important 
problems are presented: (i) the dynamic range of the TH 
precoded waveform is increased, especially in the 
presence of deep fades in the channel spectrum, and (ii) 
the computational complexity of User Equipment (UE) 
is increased. The first problem can be overcome by 
using the modulo operator. As for the second problem, a 
novel frequency-domain THP (FD-THP) 
implementation [12] was proposed in [12]. In this 
project, we proposed an improved FD-THP-FDE 
scheme to further reduce the complexity. Moreover, to 
minimize the PAPR increase, a Gaussian approximation 
(GA) based BER analysis is employed to obtain the 
optimal number of THP taps. 
On the other hand, to measure and analyze the 
above-mentioned different signaling formats for 4G 
WiMAX and LTE standards, the R/D engineers often 
resort to the state-of-the-art instruments sold by many 
equipment vendors. However, this approach can suffer 
from both the budget and technical support problems. 
Instead, in attempt to setup an easily re-configurable 4G 
testing environment with full governing details of the 
radio chain at a minimum cost, we propose an 
Instruments-in-Matlab Software-Defined Radio 
(IM-SDR) platform which integrates many existing 
general-purpose baseband and RF instruments with the 
kernel MATLAB TX/RX programs in real time. In so 
doing, all the system parameters, channel condition, and 
TX/RX algorithms can be easily re-configured and 
tested. Besides, the IM-SDR platform only uses the 
existing instruments in our laboratory, thus saving a lot 
extra cost to buy new instruments. Even if new 
standards will emerge fast in the future, the IM-SDR 
approach can be still applicable with minimum effort in 
setting up the testing environment. In addition, the 
verified system HW/SW block can then be replaced by 
later customer designed block with much higher 
processing speed and lower power/volume. Hence, the 
IM-SDR approach can serve as a reference in the later 
prototyping stage.  
This report is organized as follows. In Section III, 
the SC-FDMA transmission model is described. In 
Section IV, the mathematical descriptions of the original 
TD-THP-FDE and the improved reduced- complexity 
FD-THP-FDE schemes are presented in detail, along 
with a GA-based theoretical error probability used to 
determine the length of TD-THP. In Section V, the PAPR 
and BER performances for different schemes are then 
compared by computer simulation. In Section VI, we 
describe the proposed IM-SDR platform for transmitting 
and receiving real-world SC-FDMA signals, along with

It is well known that the circulant matrix 0H  can be 
diagonalized by pre- and post-multiplication of DFT and 
IDFT matrices, i.e.,

where (k)M denotes modulo-by-M operation. For the 
SC-LFDMA system, since h(i) is the IDFT of an M-point 
equalized frequency response segment, it actually 
contains only a few residual cyclic ISI terms [15]. The 
above feature can be advantageous in the design of DFE 
with finite-length feedback filter and 
reduced-complexity cyclic Viterbi equalizer for the 
SC-LFDMA system [17].  
 
IV. THE IMPROVED FD-THP-FDE 
SCHEME 
As indicated in [10-11], the idea of THP scheme can be 
interpreted as moving the feedback part of DFE to the 
transmitter. In so doing, the two main drawbacks of DFE 
can be overcome: (i) error propagation problem, and (ii) 
immediate decisions are no longer required for 
equalization. We first describe the TD-THP-FDE 
structure for the SC-LFDMA system below. 
A. Original TD-THP-FDE 
Before transmission, the modulation signal 
mx  is first 
precoded in the TH-Precoder, which consists of a strict 
causal feedback gFB filter of order NFB and a modulo 
device.  
For a k2-QAM constellation, the value cm subtracted by 
modulo device with input  ,

 (17) 
where k is the number of constellation points per 
dimension, and ,FB lg  is the l
th precoder coefficient. 
Hence the TD-THP output is mm my x c= − . To initialize 
the state of the feedback filter, we add NFB zeros to the 
sequence my  for each data block. Then we express the 
THP output signal my in matrix form: 
 ( )= − −y x B I y  (18) 
where B  is the N x N feedback circular matrix as

D. GA-Based Performance Analysis 
Since the optimal design of the THP-FDE scheme in 
the MMSE sense has the same coefficients and MMSE 
expressions as those in the conventional FD-DFE 
scheme. We can apply the GA-based performance 
analysis [15] to the proposed improved THP-FDE 
scheme. From eq.(20), the MMSE of the proposed 
improved FD-THP-FDE is obtained as 
22( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 2Hi i i i
MSE s nJ E E σ σ ′⎡ ⎤ ′ ′⎡ ⎤ ′′= − = + − = +⎢ ⎥⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ 0 00z s H s n s H H I  (32) 
where ′ ′= −0 0H H I  is still a circulant matrix. In [16], 
the pseudo SNR (PSNR) at the slicer input is given by 
( )1 MSE MSEJ JΓ = − . Thus, a GA-based approximate 
bit-error-rate (BER) formula is as follows 
 ( ),e GAP Q= Γ  (33) 
In the next section, numerical results will show that the 
GA-based performance analysis is very close to the 
simulated results and can be considered as an excellent 
tool for system analysis and fine tuning of the THP 
length. 
 
V. SIMULATION RESULTS 
Table I shows the main simulation parameters used 
here. We assume that the subcarrier bandwidth is 15kHz 
[3,18], the total number of available subcarriers is 
N=512 and the number of user subcarriers is M=64. The 
CP length for each block is P = 64 which is longer than 
the channel delay spread, and we use 1000 blocks for all 
SNR values. QPSK modulation and localized subcarrier 
mapping are assumed. A 6-path ITU Vehicular-A fading 
channel model is used [18]. Perfect channel knowledge 
at the transmitter and ideal channel estimation are 
assumed. The mean of the instantaneous wideband 
channel is normalized to unity. 
Fig. 4 shows the Complementary Cumulative 
Distribution Function (CCDF) of the average PAPR for 
SC-FDMA system in the NLOS channel scenario. Note 
that the ITU Vehicular A channel has a maximum 
channel delay of 2510 nsec, the ISI span is about 13 
symbols. In order to ensure that all the ISI from the 
previous symbols are cancelled, the TD-THP length is 
set to match the number of NLOS paths ( )13FBN = . As 
can be seen, the performance and average PAPR of both 
the TD-THP and the improved FD-THP schemes are 
equivalent due to the definitions of equation (27) and 
(28). Due to the THP at the transmitter, the dynamic 
range of the precoded waveform is larger than that of 
non-precoded waveform. Note that the PAPR of both 
schemes reduces as the number of subcarriers per user 
(i.e. M) decreases [12]. 
Under the parameter setting of Table I, the equivalent 
channel model in eq.(25) becomes a short channel [14]. 
Hence, it is of no need to set the number of precoder 
taps to that of NLOS paths. This helps to reduce the 
PAPR of the precoded waveform. Therefore, we attempt 
to design the THP by constraining its length. Comparing 
the GA-based BER with different numbers of precoder 
taps, we can found an optimal number of THP taps for 
the SC-FDMA system. As shown in Fig. 5, it is seen that 
the BER performance of the proposed system is best if a 
5-tap THP (NFB = 5) is used.  
When the THP length is shortened from 13 taps to 5 
taps, the PAPR of the precoded SC-FDMA signal is also 
reduced. In Fig. 6, the PAPR CCDF of the 5-tap THP 
becomes more close to that of non-precoded (receiver 
equalization) waveform. 
Choosing 5-tap THP, the BER performance of the 
improved FD-THP-FDE is compared to the original 
TD-THP-FDE and FD-DFE with and without error 
propagation, as is shown in Fig. 7. The result shows that 
moving the feedback filter of FD-DFE to transmitter can 
lead to a significant performance improvement of almost 
6-7 dB at the BER of 10-4. It is also shown in Fig. 8 that 
the GA-based theoretical curve closely matches the 
simulation curve, thus serving as an excellent system 
evaluation and design tool.

the existing instruments in our laboratory, thus saving a 
lot extra budget to buy new SDR platform. Even if new 
standards will emerge fast in the future, the proposed 
IM-SDR approach can be still applicable with great 
ease. 
C. Experimental Results 
Table II shows the system parameters used in the 
SC-FDMA real-world IM-SDR platform. Fig. 10 shows 
the photos of the equipments arrangement of IM-SDR, 
along with some measurement results like RF signal 
spectrum and demodulated IQ waveforms. First, we 
connect the transmit RF signal directly to the IQ 
demodulator to test the whole radio chain. This 
corresponds to a non-faded AWGN channel. Then we 
disconnect the wire by TX and RX antennas. After 
real-time acquisition of the waveform data into the 
laptop PC, we used the Matlab SC-FMDA RX 
algorithms to get the demodulated QPSK constellations 
and evaluate the error vector magnitude (EVM) under 
the indoor environment. Fig.11 shows the TX/RX signal 
flow and block diagram for a single uplink user. Under a 
measured Eb/N0 of about 15 dB, the EVM is compared 
for different link condition (wired and wireless at 1m) 
and CFOs (0 and 3Δf), as shown in Table III. It is seen 
that the CFO can induce some performance degradation. 
Finally, we used the TAS-4500 channel emulator to 
simulate an ITU Pedestrian A channel model. The EVM 
result is shown in Table IV. 
 
VII. Conclusion  
In this project, we proposed an improved low 
complexity FD-THP-FDE scheme, while maintaining 
the same performance as the original TD-THP-FDE. 
Considering the BER performance and the PAPR, we 
proposed to use a short-length THP to optimize the BER 
and reduce the PAPR. The theoretical BER performance 
can be accurately estimated by using the Gaussian 
approximation (GA) method. Then we demonstrated a 
new SDR platform called the Instruments-in-Matlab 
SDR (IM-SDR) platform. Although there is nothing new 
individually, the synergy of both ingredients realized a 
high re-configurability envisioned by the ideal SDR. 
With least effort and extra budget, this integrated 
approach transforms the conventional radio testing 
environment into a new one suitable for fast algorithmic 
verification and overall system performance evaluation 
during the R/D stage. Using the 4G SC-FDMA signal as 
an example, it is seen that all the system parameters, 
channel conditions, and TX/RX algorithms can be easily 
re-configured and tested on the integrated IM-SDR 
platform.
