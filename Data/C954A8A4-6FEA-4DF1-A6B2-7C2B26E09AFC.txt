1Abstract—This paper studies the practical stability of the 
incorporation of integral compensation into the low-and-high gain 
control for developing a class of regulating controllers in the 
presence of norm-type input saturation and constant disturbance. 
A set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is proposed to obtain the 
design parameter, with which the incorporation can perform
practical stabilization as well as asymptotic output regulation
without incurring the chattering effect in the control signal. 
Moreover, we show that, with the selection of design parameter, 
the incorporation can establish an asymptotic equilibrium point
locating at the portion of the ultimate boundedness region on 
which the control signal is unsaturated.
Keywords—Practical stability, bounded-input control, integral 
compensation, low-and-high gain control.
I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we consider a class of systems modeled by 
cascading linear systems with norm-type input saturation:

Input saturation with Euclidean norm (2) in two or three 
dimensions is often encountered in controlling the 
mechanical/electrical systems, where forces with limited 
magnitudes are used for the control inputs. This type of input 
saturation imposes not only magnitude limitation but also 
coupling effects on the individual input components. Therefore 
under such saturation, an excessive utilization of one input 
component may result in malfunctions of other components. A 
typical example is the vehicle skidding in an action of cornering 
with too much braking. In this example, the extremely 
employing the longitudinal component of the tire/road friction 
(by too much braking) makes the lateral component of the 
friction unable to provide enough centrifugal force demanded 
for the cornering motion (see [1] and references therein). In 
view of this, the feature of the norm-type saturation is basically 
different from that of the following one

which, commonly tackled in the control literature, allows the 
individual input components to saturate separately and 
independently. In this study, we develop controllers for the 
norm-type saturation, and a related modification in order to 
cope with (3) can be seen in [2] and references therein.
There has been lots of research activity over the last two 
decades considering the problems of stabilization subject to 
input saturation (see [2-7] and references therein). Among them, 
an elegant approach is the use of low-and-high gain technique 
[3,4]. In the presence of input saturation and matching 
disturbance, this technique proposes an effective way of 
choosing design parameters to stretch the stabilization region as 
well as to over-saturate the control signal [7] so that the 
utilization of control input can be enhanced to achieve some 
performances beyond stabilization, such as disturbance 
attenuation and robustness. Like the Lyapunov redesign 
methodology [8] and sliding mode control [9], this technique 
ensures the controllers with sufficiently high gains can confine 
steady state error to an arbitrarily small region of ultimate 
boundedness. A tradeoff, however, is the consequence of high 
frequency chattering in the control signal. In applications, this 
technique has the advantage of directly obtaining design 
parameters from solving algebraic Riccati equations (ARE), 
whereas the method of sliding mode control needs performing 
additional canonical transformations to establish the sliding 
surfaces and to derive the design parameters.
In order to eliminate the steady-state error in the 
low-and-high gain control without resorting to the extremely
high gain, this study considers the possibility of incorporating 
integral compensation into the original low-and-high gain 
control; it is because integral compensation has the potential of 
achieving robust asymptotic output regulation and disturbance 
rejection when the exogenous signals are constant or approach 
constant limit. While taking the promising improvement as 
mentioned, this incorporation requires a rigorous stability 
analysis of the inherent integrator saturation, since this windup 
phenomenon of integrators has been recognized as an instability 
factor in the integral control with input saturation (see [10] and 
references therein). Further, this incorporation may also need 
reconsideration of the enough amount of the high gain to be 
used. By this amount, the incorporation under input saturation is 
able to perform practical stabilization and achieve asymptotic 
regulation without incurring the chattering effect in the control 
signal.

 For fixed 
1( ( ), , , , )Q P B h  , LMI (10) can always be
satisfied with sufficiently large
H , since its right hand side 
is fixed, while its left hand side can be set arbitrarily small 
by increasing 
H .
B. Practical Stability
The selection of ( , )HP  enables the controller (7) under the 
input saturation to establish a practical stabilization region 
containing the initial set   as a subset. To see this, by 
substituting the controller (7) into the system (6), we obtain the 
feedback system as

Fact 1. (Practical stability) Consider the design parameter

Fact 1 indicates that the feedback system (12) takes a region 
of positive invariance 2( )VL c  and a region of ultimate 
boundedness 1( )VL c , which can be set arbitrarily small by 
assigning 
H  sufficiently large. Accordingly, there exists a

Moreover, if the system (1) is null-controllable (so is the system

Fact 1, we set

Under this condition, the feedback system (12) behaves 
semi-globally and practically stable.

null controllable.
For comparison, the simulation results of using the original 
low-and-high gain control (15) are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 with 
24H   and 300H  , respectively. In these results, the other 
parameters satisfying (15b)-(15e) are chosen as:

0.4h , and

We can see in Figs. 2 and 3 that as the larger high gain 300H 
is selected, the associated output  1 3 Ty x x  behaves more 
closer to the zero state in the steady. However as shown in the 
response of the control input, this kind of high gain selection 
may incur the chattering effect in the control signal.

which can be verified satisfying (8)-(10) and (16).
Fig. 4 depicts the related simulation results by using the 
controller (7). We observe that with 24H  , which is not so 
large as compared to the original low-and-high gain control in 
Fig. 3, the corresponding output  1 3 Ty x x  can eventually 
go to zero state. Besides, the related control shows no chattering 
phenomenon and behaves finite-time saturated as expected.
V. CONCLUSION
This study considers a class of controllers subject to 
norm-type input saturation. This class of controllers is formed 
by incorporating integral compensation into the original 
low-and-high gain control. By the incorporation, the resulting 
controller is able to achieve practical stabilization as well as 
asymptotic output regulation without inducing the chattering 
effect due to the extremely high gain. We formulate a set of LMI 
to obtain the suitable high gain that, in our numerical examples, 
appears not so large to attain both the practical stabilization and 
asymptotic regulation. The behavior and stability of the 
incorporated control are also discussed. We show that the 
selection of the suitable high gain allows the incorporated
control to establish an equilibrium point locating at a portion of 
the ultimate boundedness region on which the control signal is 
unsaturated. Numerical examples are illustrated for the 
proposed approach.
