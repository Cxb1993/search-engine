ion size on the electrokinetic transport phenomena 
arising in a charged microchannel containing salt-
free solution. Therefore, the main objective of this 
project is to derive the accurate approximate 
analytical solutions for the electric potential 
distribution and the electroosmotic flow velocity in 
a charged planar slit containing a salt-free solution 
by solving the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, 
which include the effect of ion size, and Navier-
Stokes equation. Based on these results, a systematic 
parametric study, especially for effect of ion size, 
on osmotic pressure and electro-osmosis velocity is 
detailed.

1. Introduction 
A salt-free solution is referred to a special system in which the liquid phase contains only 
counterions dissociated from the functional groups of the charged surfaces. Such systems occur in 
lamellar liquid crystals formed by ionic amphiphiles [1], and also when, for example, colloidal 
particles, clay sheets, surfactant micelles or bilayers whose surfaces contain ionizable groups 
interact in water [2]. Aqueous dispersion containing natural polyelectrolytes such as proteins, 
nucleic acids, and DNA, and synthetic polyelectrolytes such as polyacrylic acid (PAA) can also be 
treated as a salt-free solution when the concentrations of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions are 
much lower than the concentration of counterions dissociated from these polyelectrolytes [3,4]. 
Even an electrolyte solution with low salt concentration (< M) can also be approximated as a 
salt-free solution [5]. Electrokinetic phenomena for colloidal particles such as electrophoresis 
[4,6-13] and electroosmosis [14] in a salt-free solution are quite different from those in an 
electrolyte solution. This difference is caused by the fact that most of the counterions are condensed 
in a very thin layer around the highly charged surface, which is known as the counterion 
condensation.

Electroosmosis has been widely used for separating, pumping and mixing in micro- and 
nanofluidic devices [15,16]. Ohshima [14] studied the steady-state transverse electroosmotic flow 
(EOF) through an array of parallel soft cylinders in a salt-free solution. The theoretical results show 
that the electroosmotic velocity is independent of the particle charge if the particle charge is greater 
than a critical value. Qiao and Aluru [17] discussed the steady-state EOF in a salt-free solution for 
various nanochannel widths ranging from 0.95 to 10 nm using molecular dynamics and continuum 
theory. They found that the continuum flow theory is applicable for EOF in channels as small as 2.2 
nm provided that the viscosity variation near the channel wall is taken into account. In practical 
situations, many microfluidic processes such as electrophoretic separation [18,19], sample injection 
[20] and AC electrokinetic mixing [21] in an electrolyte solution involve the transient response of 
EOF. Since the electrokinetic phenomena in a salt-free solution are different from those in an 
electrolyte solution, studying the  unsteady EOF in a salt-free solution helps to understand the 
chemical and physical features of many transient electrokinetic processes operated in salt-free 
solutions. Recently, a detailed theoretical analysis has been carried out to study the transient EOF in 
a uniformly charged slit and cylindrical microchannels containing a salt-free solution [22,23]. The 
results show that the general behavior of transient EOF is similar to that observed in a microchannel 
containing an electrolyte solution [24-26]; however, the steady-state EOF significantly deviates 
from the typical plug flow and the rate of increase in the electroosmotic mobility is strongly 
suppressed due to the effect of counterion condensation. Also, the characteristic time for the EOF to 
reach the steady state is found to be proportional to the square of the channel width, which was 
validated by experimental results obtained using laser-induced fluorescence photobleaching 
anemometer (LIFPA) [20]. More recently, the analysis of Chang’s work [23] is extended to the 
more general case where the planar slit surfaces may carry dissimilar constant charges or potentials 
[27]. The results show that the regime where the electric double layer field exists in a salt-free 
solution can not be identified from the electric potential profile. In contrast, such information is 
clearly revealed in the counterion concentration profile. Furthermore, the effect of finite electric 
double-layer thickness on the Smoluchowski equation with an average zeta potential can be ignored 
inside the oppositely charged slit microchannel containing a salt-free solution, which significantly 
differs from that observed in an electrolyte solution [28]. 
All of the theoretical studies using the continuum theory, as mentioned above, on the 
electrokinetic transport phenomena are based on the classic Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This 
equation has the limitations in describing the adsorption of ions to a highly charged surface and the 
steric effect arising from the finite ion size. For example, the threshold ion size for a uniformly

4. Electroosmotic Flow Field 
The salt-free solution is idealized as an incompressible Newtonian fluid with a constant 
viscosityμ  and density ρ . When a uniform electric field E  is applied along the z-axis direction 
starting at time , the fluid starts to move due to electroosmosis and its equation of motion is 
governed by

potential increases but the counterion concentration decreases as φ  (or the diameter of counterion

expected to be obvious for higher h/λ (or surface charged density σ) due to the effect of counterion 
condensation.

In this paper, the modified PBE, which takes into account the finite ion size, derived by
orukhov et al. [6-8] has been used to investigate the effect of ion size on EOF through a uniformly 
harged planar slit microchannel containing a salt-free solution.  
Consider an infinitely long slit microchannel of width 2h, uniformly charged with a surface
charge density σ and filled with a salt-free solution containing only counterions. The electric 
potential field, ψ(x), in a salt-free solution with the counterion's valence –z can be described by the 
modified PBE, which can be nondimensionalized as  
where . 
 Here n0 is the concentration of counterions at center where ψ(x)=0 and a is the diameter of the 
counterion. Note that λ defines a layer near the charged surface within which the counterions are
localized [9]. Also, the steady-state axial velocity subject to u’(0)=0 and u(h)=0 becomes

Effect of Ion Size on Electroosmotic Flow in Slit 
Microchannel Containing Salt-Free Solution  
Abstract: Effect of ion size on the electroosmotic flow through a uniformly charged planar slit
microchannel containing a salt-free solution is theoretically studied by solving the nonlinear 
modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. The results show that the 
electroosmotic velocity increase as the diameter of counterion increases due to the fact that the
electric potential has the same trend.   
1 Introduction  
Electroosmosis has been widely used for separating, pumping and mixing in micro- and 
nanofluidic devices [1,2]. Recent theoretical analysis of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) through slit
and cylindrical microchannels containing a salt-free solution [3-5] has demonstrated that the 
steady-state EOF significantly deviates from the typical flow pattern observed in an electrolyte 
solution and the rate of increase in the electroosmotic mobility is strongly suppressed due to the
effect of counterion condensation. It was also confirmed that the Smoluchowski equation with an
average zeta potential is still valid inside the oppositely charged slit microchannel filled with a 
salt-free solution. However, these studies are based on the classic Poisson-Boltzmann equation 
(PBE), which has the limitation in describing the steric effect arising from the finite ion size.
