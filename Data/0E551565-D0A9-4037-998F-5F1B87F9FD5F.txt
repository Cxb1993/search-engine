Abstract 
In this project, a hybrid fuzzy modeling is proposed for mining microary data. A typical 
microarray data consists of the expressions of tens of thousands of genes on a genomic scale, and 
there is no systematic procedure to analyze this information instantaneously. To avoid higher 
computational complexity, it needs to select the most likely differentially expressed gene markers to 
explain the effects of ovarian cancer. In the proposed approach, regression analysis is applied to find 
target genes for microarray data of ovarian cancer first. Genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm 
optimization (PSO), support vector machine (SVM), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are 
hybridized to select gene markers from target genes. Finally, an improved fuzzy model is applied to 
classify cancer tissues. From simulation results, 200 target genes are obtained after regression analysis 
and six gene markers are selected from the hybrid process of GA, PSO, SVM and ANOVA. 
Additionally, these gene markers are verified by the improved fuzzy modeling. The proposed 
approach can be used to analyze gene expressions and has admirable performance in microarray data 
of ovarian cancer.

1 Introduction 
       Typically, the microarray data contains genes with tens of thousands of dimension [1-7]. It is a 
non-trivial task to tackle the genes with such a high dimension. Besides, it is difficult to categorize 
cancer on the basis of their genes expressions when the size of samples is small [7-10]. Recently, there 
are many methods such as feature selection, correlation methods, nonparametric scoring approach, and 
bayesian variable selection approach that are proposed to select informative genes from microarray 
data [7,11-23]. But there is no consideration about the variable gene selection and block effect in 
microarray data. A number of machine learning methods and genomic expression for ovarian cancers 
have been successfully applied to the analysis of gene expression in microarray data [24-29]. A key 
emphasis in above literature is to identify gene products that could act as specific markers of ovarian 
cancer, but the time complexity is rather high due to genomic expression with high dimension. In this 
project, a novel hybrid fuzzy modeling is proposed for mining microary data. In the proposed 
algorithm, regression analysis is first performed to find target genes in the proposed algorithm. A 
hybrid process based on genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), support vector

Some classification problems do not have a satisfactory solution but have a nonlinear one. The 
nonlinear SVM can map the input data into a high-dimension feature space via a mapping 
function ( )xφ . By virtue of constructing the feature space, it can substitute ( )xφ  into Eq. (6) and has

3 The proposed algorithm 
In this project, the microarray data of ovarian tissues, vaginal tissues, cervical tissues and 
myometrium from patients were collected at China Medical University Hospital. Tissues applied in 
this study include 5 ovarian tumors (OVT), 5 ovarian cancers at stage I (OVCAI) and 5 ovarian 
cancers at stage III (OVCAIII). In this study, regression analysis is used to reduce the dimension (9600 
genes) and then to find target genes. After regression analysis, 100 genes with maximum residuals and 
100 genes with minimum residuals are selected as target genes [40]. Furthermore, a hybrid process of 
GA, PSO, SVM and ANOVA are applied to select gene markers. To implement this hybrid process, 
the RBF kernel function is used for SVM. The RBF kernel function is suitable for high dimensional 
data and only needs to define two parameters (C and σ). In order to find the best values of C and σ, 
both parameters are encoded in the chromosome of GA and particles of PSO. For initialization, the 
initial population of GA and particles of PSO are generated randomly. For GA and PSO, chromosomes 
and particles are encoded as gene masks corresponding to all human cDNA clones, C and σ. For GA, 
the binary value of each gene mask with 1 represents that this gene is selected for verifying OVT and
