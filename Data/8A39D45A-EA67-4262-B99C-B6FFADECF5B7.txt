respectively at pH 7.2.  Moreover, chloroform could be dechlorinated in the Cu(II)-amended 
iron suspensions.  
The synergistic effect of Cu(II) amended Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems was found due to 
formation of secondary mineral phases. When Cu(II) was added into Fe(II) solution in the 
absence of other iron oxide minerals a precipitate was formed and  oxidation of Fe(II) into 
Fe(III) coupling to Cu(II) reduction formed new mineral phase. XRD and XPS analysis 
suggested that this solid phase contained amorphous ferrihydrite and Cu2O. When the 
Fe(II)/Cu(II) ratio varied between 1 and 10, the pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) for CT 
dechlorination increased 250-fold  from 0.007 h-1 at 0.5 mM Fe(II) to 1.754 h-1 at 5 mM Fe(II).  
XRPD and SEM analyses showed that Cu(II) can  react with Fe(II) to produce different 
mineral phases including ferrihydrite goethite, hematite and green rust. 
When GR(Cl) was amended with Cu(II) a secondary mineral phase produced from the 
GR(Cl)-Cu(II) system were characterized by XRD and XPS, that shows oxidation of GR(Cl) 
to magnetite coupling with Cu(II) reduction to Cu(o) in addition Cu(I) also could be identified 
in the aqueous phase.  In this system the ko for dechlorination increased by 84 times for CT, 
4.7 times for PCE and 7 times for TCE.   
Cu(II) also could enhanced dechlorination of CT by bioenic Fe(II) under microbial Fe(III) 
reducing condition and  during Fe(II) was generated by dissimilatory iron reducing bacterium 
Geobacter  sulfurreducens,  giving impetus that Cu(II) can increase the reductive 
dechlorination process led by natural Fe(II) systems in the subsurface conditions for the 
natural attenuation of highly chlorinated compounds or engineered systems that facilitate the 
in-situ cleanup of chlorinated hydrocarbons using Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems.

1.1 BACKGROUND AND THEORY 
1.1.1 Introduction 
 
The contamination of groundwater with chlorinated hydrocarbons is a well-recognized 
environmental problem.  The most prevalent chlorinated hydrocarbons are polychlorinated 
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorinated methanes and ethenes.1-3  The use of these 
compounds has been for several decades in large quantities for different purposes as solvents, 
refrigerants, forming agents, pesticides, propellants and for household purposes such as dry-
cleaning.4-6 Due to the frequent release to the environment by accidental leakage from tanks, 
or from leaching of waste disposal sites, these compounds can be found in the contaminated 
environment.7-9 Generally, many chlorinated hydrocarbons can exist for a significant long 
time in subsurface environments and gradually enter into human body and biosphere. Table 1-
1 shows the physico-chemical properties and the suggested half-lives of chlorinated methanes 
and ethenes those are most frequently found in soil and ground water in contaminated sites.10 
Their toxic effects to human beings and environmental impact prompt the investigation of 
possible remedial technologies.  Up to now, remediation of groundwater contaminated by 
chlorinated solvents is one of more complex technical challenges faced by environmental 
engineers and scientists.1,2    Because of the limitation of oxygen concentration under 
subsurface conditions11, reductive dechlorination is the most favorable pathway for the 
dechlorination  of chlorinated hydrocarbons.  Reductive dechlorination of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons in natural anoxic environments can undergo through both biotic and abiotic 
reactions.12 Biological reductive dechlorination is driven by microorganisms using chlorinated 
compounds as terminal electron acceptors coupling with the oxidation of organic 
compounds.13-17 Abiotic reductive dechlorination occurs due to the reduction by various types 
of natural reductants such as co-enzymes18-20, and reduced natural organic matter (NOM) and 
quinone moieties.21   Moreover, Fe(II)-bearing sulfide minerals and sheet silicates (biotite and 
  6 
Large fractions of iron in the subsurface also exist in the form of Fe(III) and  are available 
as oxides, hydroxides and oxihydroxides those are commonly referred as iron oxides. 
Basically, Fe(III) ions have very  low solubility, and measurable concentrations of Fe(III) ions 
in natural water is present only under strong acidic conditions32.  Hence, almost all of the 
Fe(III) ion is available as insoluble oxides or hydroxides under the natural conditions.  Some 
of those minerals also contain Fe(II) structurally combined with Fe(III). To date 16 “iron 
oxide” minerals have been identified.33 These iron oxides are summarized in Table 1-2 with 
their mineral names and molecular formula.32  Certain iron oxides such as magnetite and 
green rusts shown in Table 1-2 contain both Fe(II) and Fe(III) .   Basically iron oxides those 
do not contain Fe(II) are very stable and do not react as electron donors and exist even in 
surface soil or surface water that often expose to air.     The most abundant and available iron 
oxides in the nature are goethite, hematite, ferrihydrite and magnetite. 32,34,35  Goethite, 
hematite and magnetite are well crystalline iron minerals, while ferrihydrite is a poorly 
crystalline iron mineral.  In the natural environments, ferrihydrite is thought to be a precursor 
to form other crystal minerals through different mechanisms, depending on the presence of 
Fe(II) ions36, other transition metal ions, anions37-39,  pH and temperature.32 During those 
transformations, the resulting minerals include hematite, goethite and in some cases, 
lepidocrocite or mixtures of those minerals37. Moreover, ferrihydrite also can be transformed 
to crystal minerals under natural subsurface conditions through reductive dissolution of Fe(III) 
by microbial activities and the product is mainly the mixed-valence iron oxides such as 
magnetite.   
 
1.1.3  Microbial Fe(III) reduction 
Until late 1980s,  it was generally believed that Fe(II) available in the subsurface and 
anoxic sediment environment was only due to the abiotic reduction of Fe(III) minerals.40

and quinone compounds can act as electron shuttling compounds between solid Fe(III) oxide 
minerals and DIRB to enhance the rate of microbial reduction of solid Fe(III) oxide 66.  The 
proposed mechanism for electron shuttling by quinone compounds between Fe(III) reducing 
bacteria and solid Fe(III)oxide mineral is shown  in Figure 1-2, using 2,6-anthraquinon 
disulfonate (AQDS) as the model compound.  Both in the pristine and contaminated 
subsurface environments, humic substances are available and reduced humic substances 
transform electrons from these macromolecules to insoluble Fe(III) oxides is an abiotic 
process which can take place even in the absence of bacteria.49 However, the reduction of 
oxidized humic acid to the reduced form is the biological reaction that can contribute a viral 
role to continue the Fe(III) reduction.  It has been studied that all the Fe(III) reducing bacteria 
also can reduce humic compounds49, suggesting that biological reduction of solid Fe(III) 
occurs through  electron shuttling with humic compounds. 
Recent studies also proposed the probability of excreting electron shuttling compounds 
like c-type cytochrome by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria.67 However, this hypothesis is still under 
critical arguments.68 In addition to quinone compounds, cysteine at concentrations higher than 
0.5 mM has been found to be an effective mediator to transfer electrons between solid Fe(III) 
and DIRB.45  Reduction of chelated-Fe(III) and solid Fe(III) oxides by cysteine has been 
known for several years.69-71   Doong and Schink45 experimentally proved that dissimilatory 
iron reducing bacteria, G. sulfurreducens could reduce cystine to cysteine coupling with the 
oxidation of acetate to CO2, and subsequently enhanced the microbial Fe(III) reduction. The 
schematic mechanism for biotic abiotic processes for cysteine- mediated Fe(III)-reduction is 
shown in Figure 1-3.  Since cysteine is not available outside living cells in natural 
environments, the cysteine from bacterial cells should be released or excreted and the 
knowledge related to this point is still lacking.

The microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxide minerals to Fe(II) has several impacts on the 
environments. Theses include the depletion of Fe(III) in the sediment,  the increase of 
dissolved Fe(II) concentration in groundwater and the formation of surface-bound Fe(II) 
species and structural Fe(II)-containing minerals in the subsurface environments.72  These 
various forms of Fe(II) is contributive to the reducing conditions in the relevant environments.   
Although the Fe(III) reduction is a biological reaction, the formation of Fe(II)-containing 
oxide or hydroxide minerals (mainly magnetite and green rust) is considered to be an abiotic 
reaction due to the interaction of Fe(II) ions with Fe(III) oxides.

It is generally believed that equation 1-1 is the most possible reaction according to the 
results of potentiometric titrations.74   The formation of inner-sphere surface complex on the 
surface of Fe(III) oxides can be explained by surface complexation model.80 Generally, 
surface complex model is based on monolayer sorption and hence can be expressed using 
well-known Langmuir isotherm, particularly in the range of low concentrations of dissolved 
Fe(II) to avoid precipitation on the mineral surfaces.80  At high concentrations of dissolved 
Fe(II) and higher pH, however Fe(II) species may precipitate over the monolayer and form 
multi-layers which can be explained by other sorption isotherm models such as surface

Figure 1-5.  The oxidation-reduction potential for Fe(II) in dissolved form and associated with 
iron minerals.  Fe(II) ions associated with iron minerals are more reductive compared to the 
dissolved ferrous (pH 7.0 and 250C) 
 
 Green rust also can be formed abiotically by sorption of Fe(II) onto Fe(III) oxide 
surfaces.74,92  Green rust is automatically formed in Fe(II)-containing solutions as a result of 
mineral phase transformation after the adsorption of Fe(II) on the ferrihydrite which generates 
as a result of oxygenation of Fe(II) species in the solution at the preliminary stage.74 This is 
  18 
This seems that after sorption of Fe(II) ions on Fe(III) oxides, green rust could be 
transformed into different iron minerals. Therefore, Fe(II) ions are fixed on the Fe(III) oxides 
minerals and become non-desorbed because of the transformation to the well-crystalline 
minerals.  Several studies reported the incomplete recovery of Fe(II) after adsorption on Fe(III) 
oxides.77,96,97   It suggests that electron transfer from adsorbed Fe(II) to structural Fe(III) 
(magnetite, hematite) could be occurred and such transformations of electron are referred to 
as interfacial electron transfer (IET).98,99 Then the new Fe(III) on surface may hydrolyze and 
act as a secondary Fe(III) mineral phase on the surface of primary mineral phase.  Equation 1-
8 demonstrates the interfacial transformation.77

This means that not only the surface but the bulk of the Fe(III) mineral  also will be reduced 
due to the reactivity of  surface-bound Fe(II) species. 
Iron oxide minerals are one of the most important and efficient natural sorbents in soils 
sediments and water bodies.100 The Fe(II) associate with iron oxides are also important in the 
biogeochemistry as well as in the environmental chemistry in relation to the fate and transport 
of contaminants.   The surface-bound Fe(II) species have strong reductive capacity to 
decompose priority pollutants under anoxic conditions and can be utilized for the remediation 
of groundwater and soil contaminated with reducible contaminants.  However, this issue has 
been neglected over the past decade. 
 
1.1.6 Reduction of contaminants by surface-bound Fe(II). 
Owing to the anoxic conditions in the contaminated subsurface environments, the most 
favorable pathway for the transformation and/or detoxification is reduction.   It was until 1995

Hematite also has been studied to reduce polyhalogenated aliphatic compounds 35,111 and 
U(VI).75,115  Since these minerals do not contain Fe(II), surface-bound Fe(II) is responsible for 
the target compounds reduction. Pecher et al.111 compared the non-desorbed surface-bound 
concentrations due to surface uptake by hematite and goethite using similar surface area 
concentration and identical experimental conditions.  The non-desorbed Fe(II) fixed on the 
surface of goethite was 2-3times higher tan that on hematite.  Elsner et al.35 compared the 
  22 
because nano-particles have high specific surface area that could expose more Fe(II) to 
oxidative dissolution coupling to the reduction of target organic compound.  
 Green rust, a meta stable mixed valence iron hydroxide, can reductively transform 
various types of priority pollutants such as nitrites121, chlorinated ethenes122,  poly 
halogenated alkanes 123-125, Cr(VI)126-128, Se(VI)129 and U(VI)130. In green rust systems, the 
reactive Fe(II) may be structural Fe(II) or adsorbed Fe(II) on the surface. Because of its 
instability, green rust is more sensitive to oxidants than other iron oxides also, green rust is 
layered structure made by Fe(II), Fe(III) and anionic inter-layers,thus providing great specific 
surface area and amphoteric surface hydroxyl groups lead to both high sorption and  reduction 
efficiency. 131  It means that green rust is an ideal mineral for reducing many environmental 
contaminants.  However, the activity of green rust may decrease and change the kinetics of 
the reduction reaction because green rust is oxidized to magnetite during the reduction process. 
 
1.1.7  Degradation kinetics of the contaminants by surface bound Fe(II) systems 
The degradation kinetics of the reduction of target contaminants by surface-bound 
Fe(II) has been reported to follow first-order rate equation.     The first order kinetics can be 
explained using rate laws as follows 
 
[ ] [ ]1Ak
dt
AdR ==           (1-9) 
where R is the rate of the reaction, [A] is the concentration of substance A, k is the rate 
constant at  temperature T.  If the temperature is constant, it can be integrated from [A]0, the 
concentration of A at the time of reaction start,  t = 0, to the variable upper limit[A], a function 
of t,. 
 [ ] ∫∫ =− tAA kdttAdA 0

        (1-10) 
  24 
the major reason for the relationship between pH and rate constant is the increases in the 
surface reactive sites with pH.108,109  The surface negative charge increases at high pH, 
resulting in the increase in the columbic repulsions to attract Fe(II)  onto the surface.78  The 
adsorbed Fe(II) ions can then form inner-sphere complexation.  Usually, the sorption of Fe(II) 
on iron minerals starts at pH 5.5 and the adsorption will be completed at around pH 7.5 . 
Further increase in pH facilitates the precipitation of aqueous Fe(II) species on the surface.75 
Therefore, different types of reactive species may be formed at surface, depending on the pH 
and the amount of Fe(II) uptake.  However, the knowledge on the types of species on the 
surface and their roles in the surface reactivity with respect to the reduction of contaminants is 
limited.  Generally, the increase in Fe(II) concentration on the surface due to the increase in 
pH is considered as the major reason for enhancing of reduction rate.   Moreover, the redox 
potentials of both aqueous Fe(II) and surface sites of iron mineral vary due to variable  pH.108   
The effect of pH on the reactivity of meta-stable mixed valence iron hydroxides (green 
rust) systems also has been observed.122 Similar to that in surface-bound Fe(II) systems, the 
reactivity increases upon increasing pH in green rust systems. In neutral buffered mediums, 
some dissolved Fe(II) can be detected due to dissolution of green rust.35 Therefore, the 
increase in pH may enhance the uptake of Fe(II) onto surface and form inner-sphere 
complexation from ≡FeIIIOH groups to form ≡FeIIIOFeIIOH species, as previously described 
in equation 1-1.   The other possibility is the change in reactivity of  Fe(II) due to the 
protonation and deprotonation of reactive ferrous-hydroxyl groups.  Green rust is a layered 
ferrous and ferric hydroxide and between two layers anions are available making ligands.   
Thus each layers has  ≡FeIIOH and ≡FeIIOH2+ groups which are originally from the hydrolysis 
of partially un-coordinated surface iron.122   Generally, ≡FeIIOH groups are reactive to be 
oxidized but ≡FeIIOH2+ groups are not reactive due to the low electron density on the centered 
Fe(II) ion.  When the pH increases, the protonated groups can deprotonated, as shown in 
  26 
between the sorbed Fe(II) concentration and the rate constant of the reducing reaction 
(kobs).109,133  In order to increase the sorbed Fe(II) concentration, the available surface area of 
the Fe(III) minerals is also an important  parameter.   Surface density of Fe(II) calculated from 
the sorbed concentration and surface area measured by BET (Brenauer-Emmett-Teller) was 
also used to normalize the reduction rate of target compounds in the heterogeneous 
Fe(II)/Fe(II) suspensions.109  However the use of surface density of Fe(II) to compare 
reactivity is an expedient approach because the same surface density can be obtained using 
different mineral-loadings and different concentrations of added Fe(II) in batch experiments, 
although the total numbers of reactive surface Fe(II) sites are different.  
 
1.1.9  Reactivity of Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems towards dechlorination 
The study on reactivity and mechanism of heterogeneous Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems usually 
used nitro compounds and polyhalogenated aliphatic compounds as target compounds.  
Among polyhalogenated compounds, chlorobromomethanes, chlorinated methanes and 
ethanes have been used to evaluate the reducing capacity of surface-bound Fe(II) systems. 
However, it is still difficult to compare the reactivity of different studies because the 
experimental conditions such as mineral concentration, pH, initial concentration of Fe(II), the 
pre-equilibrium time and specific surface area of the mineral are different.  Table 1-4 
summarizes the dehalogenation of halogenated compounds by various iron minerals in the 
presence and absence of  Fe(II).   According to Table 1-4, the major chlorinated products of 
CCl4 dechlorination in surface-bound Fe(II) systems are CHCl3 and CH2Cl2. The non 
chlorinated products found were HCOO- and CO.35,111,112 However, further reduction of 
CHCl3 seems uncertain in many studies due to slow reactivity.   Other specialty is that 
chlorinated ethenes have not been reported to be reduced in the surface-bound Fe(II) systems. 
In mixed valence iron mineral systems (green rust), however, chlorinated ethenes such as PCE 
  28 
hydrogenation reaction.  Finally ethane can follow hydrogenation reaction to form ethane. 
Reductive elimination are the two major routes for the dechlorination of PCE. In the 
hydrogenolysis rout less chlorinated homologs will sequentially from ethane as the end 
product.  In the β-elimination pathway,  the fist product is dichloroacetylene that can further 
follow hydrogenolysis reaction to chloroacetylene and then acetylene. Acetylene can be 
converted to ethylene by hydrogenation reaction.  Finally, ethene can follow hydrogenation 
reaction to form ethane.

1.2 MOTIVATION 
For the dechlorination of highly chlorinated compounds to non-chlorinated or 
environmental benign compounds, the comparative evaluation of the efficiency of 
dechlorination using surface-bound Fe(II) systems in the presence of most environmentally 
available iron oxides is needed.  However, there is no such a comparison for dechlorination 
using Fe(II) associated with  both crystalline and amorphous Fe(III) oxides. Although some 
laboratory studies separately used different iron oxides in separately for different types of 
target compounds, it is not easy to compare the results due to the different experimental 
conditions.  Basically, the rates and efficiencies for the dechlorination of chlorinated 
methanes and ethenes by surface-bound Fe(II) system are quite low and need several days to 
months to be dechlorinated.  Probably due to this reason the effects of environmental 
parameters on the reactivity of Fe(II) systems have been widely studied using more reducible  
nitro compounds and brominated  hydrocarbons.103,104,111 Those data can not manipulated that 
for highly chlorinated hydrocarbons towards the evaluation of the reactivity of various 
Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems.   Moreover, although the microbial iron reduction is known to play a 
major role in the re-generation of Fe(II) species,  the use of microbially reduced iron 
oxides(mainly magnetite) for the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the presence 
of iron reducing bacteria is limited 
It is well recognized that transition metal ions are always available in the environment and 
these metal ions generally exist as dissolved forms or associated with iron oxide minerals 
under subsurface conditions. Certain metal including U(VI), Tc(VI), Cr(VI) have been 
reported to be reduced by structural Fe(II) or surface-bound Fe(II).113-115 However, the effect 
of transition metal ions on the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons by Fe(II)/Fe(III) 
systems have not been focused.  Transition metal ions such as Ni(II) and Cu(II),  are 
ubiquitous in the environment, both in pristine and contaminated sites, and are also introduced 
  34 
effect of Cu(II) for the dechlorination reactions mediated by Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems can be 
concluded.   
 
1.3 OBJECTIVES   
The main purpose of this study was to (comparatively) evaluate the reactivity of Fe(II) 
ions associated with most abundant crystalline iron minerals (goethite, hematite and magnetite) 
and amorphous Fe(III) oxides (ferrihydrite) under  iron reducing conditions towards the 
dechlorination of highly chlorinated compounds using carbon tetrachloride(CT) as model 
compound. The effect of Cu(II) ions on the dechlorination of CT by surface-bound Fe(II) was 
evaluated to understand the possibility of using Cu(II) ion as a catalyst to enhance the 
dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated compounds. Several environmental factors 
including pH, concentration of Fe(II), and concentration of Cu(II) on the dechlorination 
efficiency and rate were optimized.  The investigation of dechlorination of tetrachloroethene 
(PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) by metastable mixed valence iron hydroxide (green rust) 
and the effect of Cu(II) ion on the rate and efficiency of dechlorination was another objective.  
In addition, the interaction of Cu(II) ions with Fe(II) solutions and the formation of 
heterogeneous Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems stimulate dechlorination of CT was elucidated.  The 
changes in crystal phases and chemical species on the surface of iron oxide were 
characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  
Moreover, the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride in the presence and absence of Cu(II) 
ions under microbial Fe(III) reducing condition using dissimilatory Fe(III) reducing bacteria 
was studied to understand the possibility of simultaneously undergoing the processes of  
abiotic dechlorination of CT by  Fe(II)/Fe(III) system and biological Fe(III) reduction by 
Geobacter sulfurreducens

CHAPTER 2 
 
DECHLORINATION OF CARBON TETRCHLORIDE 
BY FERROUS ION ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS 
IRON OXIDE MINERALS 
  46 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
The contamination of groundwaters with chlorinated hydrocarbons is a widespread 
environmental problem.1-3  The environmental and health impacts of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons have prompted investigations regarding to their attenuations from natural 
environments.4-6  A number of chlorinated solvents including carbon tetrachloride (CT) and 
tetrachloroethylene (PCE) are rather persistent under aerobic conditions, but they may 
undergo reductive dehalogenation under reducing environments.7-9  Basically, the oxygen 
concentration is limited in both pristine and contaminated subsurface environments.10,11  
Therefore, reductive transformation has become an important issue from the environmental 
engineering point of view with respect to the remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in 
contaminated groundwater or soils.  Fe(II) is one of the natural reductants available in various 
forms including dissolved, mineral bound, and as hosts of Fe(II) bearing minerals.12  
Laboratory and field studies have focused on the significance of Fe(II) ions in the abiotic 
reductive transformation of halogenated compounds in soil and groundwaters.13-15  Fe(II) ion 
complexes in dissolved form have shown to reduce different types of organic compounds such 
as polyhalogenated methanes, halogenated ethanes and nitroaromatic compounds under 
anoxic conditions.6, 16  However, several studies have pointed out that the high reactivity of 
Fe(II) ion when they bound to Fe(III)-bearing minerals  compared to the reactivity of aqueous 
Fe(II) ion.13-15  The high reactivity of Fe(II) species attached to solid Fe(III) minerals is 
rationalized within the framework of surface complexation theory.16  A previous study 
observed a linear relationship between the surface density of Fe(II) ions on the surface of 
Fe(III) minerals and the reactivity for the reductive transformation of polyhalogenated  
compounds.14  The increase in the reactivity for the dehalogenation is apparently proportional 
to the total Fe(II) concentration when the Fe(II) ions in the Fe(III) mineral suspension reaches 
the equilibrium.17, 18  It is generally believed that during the contact of Fe(II) ions with the 
  48 
investigated.13-17  Since inorganic constituents such as transition metal ions often coexist with 
chlorinated solvents in wastewater26, the understanding of the effect of transition metals  on 
reductive dechlorination is important for the consideration of possible in-situ remediation.  
Depending on the crystalline properties and surface conditions, however, the transition metal 
ions also show different affinities on the surfaces of different iron oxides minerals.27  
Goethite (GT) (α-FeOOH), hematite (HM) (α-Fe2O3), amorphous ferrihydrite (FH) 
(Fe(OH)3), and magnetite (MG) (Fe3O4) are ubiquitous natural iron oxides in the 
environments.28-30  They have different crystalline properties, surface characteristics and 
mineralogical characteristics with respect to their originalities.  Therefore, the Fe(II) ions 
associated with these Fe(III) mineral surfaces may show different reactivities in the reduction 
of chlorinated compounds.  Cu(II) is a common environmental pollutant and predominant 
oxidation state of copper in natural water bodies as well as in wastewater.31-33  
The objectives of this study was to investigate the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride 
(CT) by Fe(II) ions associated with  different iron oxides including goethite, hematite, 
ferrihydrite and magnetite. The effect of Cu(II) ions on the dechlorination in each surface-
bound Fe(II) systems was also studied. Moreover, the sorption experiments of Fe(II) and 
Cu(II) onto iron oxides were also performed to verify the reactivity of such systems for the 
reductive transformation of carbon tetrachloride 
 
2.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.2.1 Chemicals 
All chemicals were used as received without further treatment. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, 
> 99.8%, GC grade), chloroform (CHCl3, > 99.8%, GC grade), CuCl2.2H2O (99%), 
FeSO4.7H2O(99%) were purchased from Merck Co. (Darmstadt, Germany).  FeCl2.4H2O 
(99%), FeCl3.6H2O (99 %), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-N’-(2-ethanosulfonic acid 
  50 
In this study, all the dechlorination and sorption experiments were carried out at near 
neutral condition (pH 7.2).  HEPES buffer was used to control pH at 7.2.  For the preparation 
of 50 mM buffer solution, 11.96 g of HEPES buffer was dissolved in 900 mL of distilled 
deionized water in a 1-L bottle and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 by adding 1M NaOH soluton.  
After adjusting the volume, the buffer solution was de-oxygenated following the similar 
procedure that was used for the preparation of anoxic water.  
 
2.2.3  Synthesis and characterization of iron oxide minerals. 
Iron oxides including goethite, hematite, magnetite and ferrihydrite were synthesized 
following the well-established methods by previous workers.35  Goethite was synthesized 
using ferric ion solution method.   Briefly, 1 M FeCl3 solution was prepared by dissolving  
27.03 g of dessicated FeCl3.6H2O in 100 mL of  water in a 2-L plastic flask and 180 mL of 
5M KOH solution was rapidly added with vigorous stirring. Then, the brown color suspension 
was immediately diluted to 2 L with DI water under ambient condition and was placed in an 
oven at 70 °C for 60 hours.  The supernatant and the bright yellow precipitate were separated 
by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10min followed by washing with deoxygenated DI water 
repeatedly for five times.  The solid pellet was decanted in sealed serum bottle with N2-stream 
and vacuuming.  For the quantification of goethite suspension, 1 mL of the suspension was 
transferred into a ceramic crucible with a known weight. The crucible was palced in a 
vacuumed dessicator under N2 atmosphere until the wieght became constant. The 
concentration of the suspension could be calculaed by the dry weight of goethite.  
Hematite was synthesized by a hydrolysis of Fe(III) salt solution.  One liter of 0.002M 
HNO3 was prepared and the acid solution was heated to 98 °C in an oven.  When the solution 
temperature reached 98 °C, the bottle was taken out and 8.4 g of desiccated Fe(NO3)3.9H2O 
was added into the acid solution with vigorous stiring.  After screw capping, the bottle was 
  52 
For ferihydrite synthesis,  500 mL of  1M FeCl3  solution was prepared in a 2-L beaker 
and the solution was titrated with 1M NaOH in a drop funnel with vigorous stirring until the 
pH of the mixture reach 7.0 ∼ 7.2.  The precipitate was allowed to settle down and the 
supernatant was removed.   Precipitate was then washed 5 times and the ferrihydrite was 
stored as a suspension under N2-atmosphere.  
In order to prepare dry samples of iron oxide for the minieralogical characterizaion and 
surface morphology studies, dry powder samples were prepared in a sealed vials by 
continuous purging with N2.  A 50-mL serum bottle was first sealed using rubber sptum and 
aluminium crimp cap.  Then the bottle was purged with N2 using syring needle and 1 mL of 
the stock suspension of iron oxide was withdrwn using N2-purged 1mL plastic syringe and 
injected into the serum bottle. The continuous N2-purge was maintained until the suspension 
transformed to dry powder. 
 
2.2.4 Dechlorination Experiments 
Batch experiments were conducted using 70 mL serum bottles those were filled with 50 
mL of deoxygenated buffer solution.  The buffer solutions were delivered to serum bottles 
using 60 mL air-tight plastic syringe under gentle flow of  N2 (42 L min-1).34  Iron oxide 
minerals including goethite (GT), hematite (HM), ferrihydrite (FH) and magnetite (MG)  were 
withdrawn from anoxic slurry in stock bottles using N2-purged syringe and were delivered 
into serum bottles to get the final concentration of 10 mM.  In order to study the effect of iron 
oxide concentration on the dechlorination, various volumes of iron oxide suspensions were 
injected into serum bottles to obtain the final concenteations of 5 ∼ 25 mM.  The required 
volume of stock solution of Fe(II) was introduced into the serum bottles to obtain a 
concentration of 3 mM.  The stock solutions of 150 mM Fe(II) were prepared by dissolving 
1.491 g of vacuumed desicated FeCl2.4H2O in deoxygenated buffer solution and the solution 
  54 
0.2 µM filter cartrige (1 cm in diameter).  Then, the Fe(II) concentrations in the filtrate was 
determined. 
For Cu(II) sorption experiments, various volumes of stock of CuCl2 solution was injected 
into iron oxide suspensions (10 mM) using N2-purged gastight plastic syringe to get the final 
concentration of Cu(II) ranging between 0.01 and 0.5mM.  The bottles were incubated for 20 
h and 1 mL of suspension was withdrawn by plastic syringe and  was fltered through 0.2 µM 
filter cartrige into 1 mL of 1 M HCl.  The dissolved concentrations of copper ions were 
determined by atomic absorption spectrosmetry (AAS).  
 
2.2.6 Analytical Methods. 
The headspace analytical technique was used in this study for the determination of 
chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons and their products 
in the headspace of the test bottles were monitored by withdrawing 50 µL of gas in the 
headspace using a 100 µL gas-tight syringe. The mixture was immediately injected into a gas 
chromatograph (GC) (Perkin-Elmer, Autosystem) equipped with a flame ionization detector 
(FID) and an electron capture detector (ECD).  A 60-m VOCOL fused-silica megabore 
capillary column (0.545 mm × 3.0 µm, Supelco Co.) was used to separate the chlorinated 
compound.  The GC-column temperature was maintained at 90 ºC isothermally with the 
nitrogen (N2) as the carrier gas.   
The concentrations of  Fe(II) in the serum bottles were monitored using Ferrozine 
method.34, 36  Ferrozine solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1g of ferrozine in 100 mL of 
ammonium actate solution (50 %).  0.5 mL of ferrozine solution was addd into 1 mL of 
acidified sample solution in 2 mL vial and after 10 min the mixture was analyzied by UV-
visible spectrometer (Hitachi, U3010) at 562 nm. The concentrations were calculated using 
  56 
information about the morphology and particle shpae of solid minerals.  Therefore, in this 
study, these two techniques were used to characterize the synthesized iron oxides including 
goethite, hematite, magnetite and ferrihydrite. 
Goethite.  As shown in Figure 2-2, the synthesized bright yellow colored iron oxide 
showed peaks at 21.22°, 36.72°, 33.34° and 53.24° 2θ with intensities of 100 %, 26.4 %,  18.0 
% and 17.2 %, respectively.   This  peak pattern is in a good agreement with that of goethite in 
the database.  The needle shape of the synthesized mineral shown in the scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) image is a characteristic of goethite.  Morover, the bright yellow color of 
this iron oxide also depicts that the mineral is goethite.  
Hematite.  As shown in Figure 2-3, the iron oxide that was synthesized by following the 
hematite preparation procedure had dominant peaks at 33.11°, 35.61°, 54.0° and 24.12° 2θ 
with intensities of 100 %, 70 %, 36 % and 24.12%, which were well-fitted with the XRD 
patern of standard hematite in the database.   The SEM image indicates that the synthesized 
hematite is a well-crystallized fine particles with particle sizes of 30 ∼ 50 nm, which is similar 
to that of the reported data.35 
Magnetite.  The XRPD patterns of the synthesized black colored minerals by using the 
procedure for the preparation of magnetite is shown in Figure 2-4. The black color of the 
mineral provided a preliminery evidence that the synthesized material could be magnetite.  
Moreover, the Cu Kα x-ray diffractogram shows dominant peakes at 35.42°, 62.51°, 30.09°, 
56.94° and 43.05° 2θ with intensity ratios of 100 %, 40 %, 30 %, 30 % and 20%, respectively, 
which can be assigned as magnetite.  The cubic shapes with variable particle sizes in the range 
of 50 ∼ 200 nm were clearly observed. 
Ferrihydrite.  In contrast to the other crystalline iron oxide minerals, ferrihydrite, also 
known as amorphous ferric oxide, is a poorly crystalline mineral.  Since XRPD only shows 
peaks for crystalline materials, the XRD pattern of ferryhydrite does not show sharp peaks.

2-6, the sorption of Fe(II) on goethite  can be fitted with the  equation (2-1), sugesting that 
Fe(II) sorption follows Lagngmuir isotherm.  A previous study reported that the Fe(II) 
sorptionon on the goethite followed Langmuir isotherm at Fe(II) concentrations of 0 - 3 
mM.14  However, continuous increase in the sorption of Fe(II) on goethite with increasing 
Fe(II) concentration has been observed when Fe(II) concentrations ranged from 0.005 to 0.5 
mM after 24 h of equilibrium.15, 17  Those observations are consistent with the sorption 
isotherm of Fe(II) on goethite obtained in this study.

The sorption isotherm of Fe(II) onto hematite also followed Langmuir isotherm 
(Figure 2-7).  The surface saturation level for hematite is lower than that for goethite, while 
the Fe(II) adsorption constant (kads) for hematite is larger.  A recent study depicted that the 
sorption of Fe(II) onto hematite followed a two-phase stage, a first rapid sorption and then 
followed by a slow sorption phase.41  The rapid sorption occurs within 1 ∼ 2 d, while slow 
  62 
U(VI) and As(V).43, 47  The sorption capacity of ferryhydrite also has been found to be 
infuenced by the type of the medium.  For instance, the bicarbonate ions in the buffered 
medium decreased the Fe(II) sorption capability.47  Hence, the real sorption capacity of 
ferrihydtire may be different from the results obtained from laboratory experiments.

Figure 2-8.  The sorption isotherm of Fe(II) on ferrihydrite at 25 °C.  Symbol and line 
represent experimental data and fitted results, respectively. 
 
In this study, the sorption isotherm was obtained at 25 °C in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) 
solution containing 10 mM ferrihydrite (1.07 g L-1).  The sorption behavior was different form 
those in goethite and hematite systems.  As shown in Figure 2-8, an exponential increase in 
sorbed Fe(II) density with the increasing Fe(II) concentration in the solution was observed, 
which can be assigned as  Freundlich sotherm  
  64 
Freundlich constant (K) is 0.0567.  Probably the used concentration range of Fe(II) may not 
enough to deveate the n value from unity. 
By summarizing the results of Fe(II) sorption on iron oxides, it is clear that, under the 
condition at neutral pH and 20 h of equilibrium, goethite and hematite show Langmuirian 
isotherms, while Freundlich isotherms are obtained in ferrihydrite and magnetite systems. 
 
2.3.4 Dechlorination of CCl4 by surface-bound Fe system 
 In order to compare the reductive capacities of dissolved and surface-bound Fe(II), 
CCl4 (CT) was incubated with 3 mM Fe(II) at pH 7.2 in the absence and presence of iron 
oxide minerals.  Figure 2-10 illustrates the dechlorination of 20µM CT and the production of 
chloroform (CF) as the major chlorinated product in Fe(II)-amended solution with and 
without the addition of iron oxides.  No obvious change in CT concentration was observed 
during the experimental course in solutions containing Fe(II) alone.  Several studies  showed 
that carbon tetrachloride (CT) can not be dechlorinated by dissolved Fe(II) at neutral pH 
during a relative short time.14, 49  Addition of Fe(II) to the iron oxide suspensions increased 
the  rate and efficiency of CT dechlorination.  A nearly complete dechlorination of CT was 
observed within 48 h in the suspention containing 10 mM hematite and 3 mM Fe(II).  Good 
removal efficiencies of CT by Fe(II) were also observed in suspensions of ferrihydrite and 
goethite.  However, the mixed-valence iron mineral, magnetite, showed a relative low 
reductive capacity and only 43 % of the initial CT was dechlorinated within 48 h.   
  66 
Chloroform (CF) was found to be the major product in all the surface-bound Fe(II) 
systems, which agreed with the previous observations that CT was dechlorinated by different 
types of Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems such as surface bound Fe(II) associated with goethite14,50 and 
biogenic magnetite.51  Because of the formation of chloroform, it is clear that reductive 
dechlorination is the prominent pathway for CT transformation.  The maximum 
concentrations of CF in all the iron oxide systems except the magnetite system were in the 
range of 7.2 – 12 µM. The production of CF concentration in magnetite system was only 1.15 
µM.  Table 2-1 shows the concentrations of CF after 48 h of incubation in iron oxide systems.  
It is clear that the mechanism in the reductive transformation of CT in each surface-bound 
system is not as the same.  The carbon mass balance with respect to chloroform formation in 
surface-bound Fe(II) systems is 73.5 % in ferrihydrite, 57.4 % in goethite, 54.3 % in hematite 
and 13.7 % in magnetite systems, clearly showing that there may exist another mechanism for 
CT dechlorination. 
Previous studies showed that Fe(II)-goethite suspension transformed 58% ∼ 80 % of CT to 
CF at neutral pH.14,50  However, low conversion ratio (0 ∼ 24%) was also observed in 
magnetite system.52  In this study, a trace amount of dichloromethane (DCM) and 
tetrachloroethene (PCE) were also determined by GC-ECD after10 d of incubation.  However, 
the concentration of CF did not show a significant decrease during the experimental period.  
Resent study revealed that the product distribution in transformation of target organics by 
surface-bound Fe(II) and Fe(II)-bearing minerals may be mainly dependent on the types of 
iron oxide mineral and target organic compound.16  According to the result obtained this study, 
a difference in product formation ratio was observed when CT was transformed by Fe(II) 
associated with different iron oxide systems. 
 
 
  68 
stage and the high affinity of surface reactive sites towards the produced compounds.17,50  
Table 2-2 shows the apparent pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) and the normalized 
surface area rate constant (ksa) for CT dechlorination in systems contained various types of 
iron oxides and 3 mM Fe(II) at pH 7.2.  The kobs for the dechlorination in different iron oxide 
systems followed the order of hematite > ferrihydrite > goethite > magnetite, according to the 
magnitude.  When the normalized surface area rate constant (ksa ) was used by dividing the 
kobs by available surface area of iron oxide minerals in the serum bottles, the ksa followed the 
order of  goethite > hematite > magnetite > ferrihydrite.  Since similar molar concentration 
(10 mM) of iron oxides were amended into the bottles and the dechlorination in Fe(II)-Fe(III) 
suspension is a surface mediated reaction, it is reasonable to use ksa to compare the 
dechlorination kinetics of CT  in surface-bound Fe(II) associated various iron oxide.   
It is clear that goethite, the most abundant crystalline iron oxide, has the highest ksa 
value, indicating the positive role in the abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated solvents.  
Hematite is also a well crystalline and the most stable iron oxide and has a high ksa value.  
Magnetite is a relatively low stable crystalline mineral which bears structural Fe(II) and 
frequently generated by bacterial Fe(III) reduction.51,54  Its dechlorination capability with 
respect to ksa is in the third place in the sequence.  Ferrihydrite, the amorphous iron mineral 
with high specific surface area, has the lowest ksa value obtained in this study.  This means 
that crystal property of the iron mineral may be one of the important factors influencing the 
efficiency of CT dechlorination.  Since goethite suspension has the highest capability for CT 
dechlorination regarding ksa, it was selected as the model iron oxide to examine the effect of 
environmental parameters on the dechlorination of CT in the further experiments.

∼ 6.5, pH7.0 ∼ 8.0 and pH 8.5, respectively. 
 
Similar trend in the relationship between kobs and pH with surface-bound Fe(II) 
concentration has been observed in the reduction of fluorotribromomethane (CFBr3) by 
Fe(II)-goethite suspension.17   Several studies also depicted that the increase in kobs at high pH 
may be because that pH controls some factors directly responsible for the reactivity of the 
system.13,17   For example, the uptake of dissolved Fe(II) ions onto the surface of iron mineral 
significantly depends on the pH.  The precipitation of dissolved Fe(II), mainly as hydroxide, 
can actively participate in the reducing reaction at high pH.17,25  Also, the oxidation-reduction 
potentials (Redox) of reactions may depend on the pH and may serve as another factor 
influencing the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds.

where kobs is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the dechlorination of CT, kapp is the 
apparent reaction rate constant, KFe is the equilibrium constant for the adsorption of Fe(II) to 
goethite and CFe is the initial aqueous concentration of  Fe(II).  Equation (2-4) suggests that 
the CT dechlorination is a surface-mediated reaction and the observed reaction rate constant 
(kobs) is dependent on the reactivity of the surface-bound Fe(II) species in relation to the 
apparent reaction rate constant kapp , sorption of Fe(II) on the iron oxide minerals and the

increased linearly with increasing goethite concentration (Figure 2-16).  This results depict 
that goethite surface could be saturated with surface-bound Fe(II) at neutral pH and the 
limited surface area is one of the rate-limiting factors for the dechlorination reaction.

  76 
had different enhancement effects on the dechlorination of CT in various Fe(II)-iron oxide 
systems.  The Fe(II)-goethite suspensions showed the highest efficiency for CT dechlorination 
and a nearly complete CT dechlorination was observed during 1.5 h.  The dechlorination 
efficiency with 0.5 mM Cu(II) is 90 times greater than that without Cu(II) in Fe(II)-goethite 
suspension.  Similar degradation patterns were observed in magnetite-Fe(II) and hematite-
Fe(II) systems and the degradation efficiency of CT were enhanced nearly 25 and 30 times, 
respectively, in comparison with Cu(II) un-amended suspensions. The CT degradation pattern 
in amorphous ferrihydrite-Fe(II) was different from those in crystalline Fe(III) oxide systems 
and only 50 % of the initial CT was dechlorinated within 2.8 h.  This proves again that Fe(II) 
bound to crystal surfaces may be more effective than amorphous Fe(III)oxide in the presence 
of Cu(II). 
 Chloroform (CF) was found as the major chlorinated byproduct (Figure 2-17).  The 
production of CF increased with the decrease in CT concentrations in Cu(II)-amended 
systems, clearly showing that reductive dechlorination is still the major pathway for CT 
dechlorination in the presence of Cu(II).  The maximum concentrations of CF were in range 
of 10.7 - 11.7 µM, which accounted for 55 – 60 % of the CT concentration.  It is noted that 
the maximum concentration of CF in the ferrihydrite-Fe(II)-Cu(II) system corresponded to 
around 95 % of the dechlorinated CT.  This value is quite higher than that in the other iron 
oxide-Fe(II)-Cu(II) suspensions, further suggesting that the dechlorination mechanisms in 
amorphous iron oxide system could be different from those in crystalline iron oxide systems.

The dechlorination of CT by Fe(II)-iron oxides in the presence of Cu(II) also followed  
first-order reaction kinetics, depicting that the addition of Cu(II) into the surface-bound Fe(II) 
systems did not change the order of the dechlorination reaction.  Table 2-3 shows the 
observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) for CT dechlorination by the surface-bound 
iron species with 0.5 mM Cu(II). According to the magnitude of kobs for CT dechlorination 
surface-bound Fe(II) systems were in the order of goethite > hematite > magnetite > 
ferrihydrite, which is a little different from that for the Fe(II)-iron oxide suspensions without 
Cu(II).  Addition of Cu(II) ion enhanced the kobs values up to 100,  29.6, 3.2 and 120 times in 
goethite, hematite, ferrihydrite and magnetite suspensions, respectively. The highest 
enhancement effect on the CT dechlorination was in magnetite suspension, while low 
enhancement effect was observed in the amorphous ferrihydrite system.  
  80 
was re-spiked four times.  Magnetite suspension showed complete dechlorination only for 
three times of spike within the experimental course.  In the ferrihydrite system, complete 
dechlorination of CT could be obtained in the first spike during 16 hours and only 70% of CT 
was dechlorinated for the second spike within 24 h.  This indicates that surface-bound Fe(II) 
systems have the capability in dechlorinating relatively large amount of chlorinated 
compounds in the presence of Cu(II).  With the increase in the number of re-spikes, however, 
a decrease in the efficiency and rate of CT dechlorination in each iron oxide systems was 
observed.  This decrease also depended on the types of iron oxides.  Figure 2-19 shows the 
decreases in kobs for CT dechlorination with the increasing number of spikes.  It is clear that 
higher reactive iron oxide systems, such as goethite, deactivate faster than the low reactive 
systems.  The decrease in reactivity could be due to the deactivation of highly reactive 
surface-bound Fe(II) sites on the iron oxides at the first stage of the incubation period.17   
However, the reactive sites of the surface-bound Fe(II) species could be regenerated in the in-
situ subsurface environments by the biological Fe(III) reduction process of dissimilatory iron 
reducing bacteria (DIRB). 
 
2.3.9 Reduction of chloroform by Cu(II) catalyzed  surface bound Fe(II) systems 
 Since chloroform (CF) was accumulated with the rapid reduction of carbon 
tetrachloride, further experiment was carried out to understand the possible dechlorination of 
CF.  Generally, the dechlorination of 20 µM CT can produce about 10 µM of CF.  Therefore, 
similar concentration of CF was used as the initial concentration.  The CF concentration was 
detected periodically during 90 days.  A decrease in CF concentration by 3 mM Fe(II) in 
various iron oxide suspensions was observed in the presence of 0.5 mM Cu(II) (Figure 2-20). 
A two-phase dechlorination behavior with a rapid dechlorination during first 15 days followed 
by a slow dechlorination phase in 90 days was observed in all the iron oxide suspensions.   
  82 
Carboxen-PDMS fiber was employed.  Only DCM peak was observed and no additional peak 
was appeared in the chromatograph after the SPME analysis.  This result suggests that 
chloroform was produced as the major byproduct of CT dechlorination and can be further 
dechlorinated into less chlorinated products after a relative long incubation time.

(goethite, hematite,  Magnetite and ferrihydrite) in the presence of 0.5 mM Cu(II) at pH 7.2 
and 25°C. 
 
2.3.10 The sorption of Cu(II) on iron minerals 
Although the addition of 0.5 mM Cu(II) concentration could enhance the rate and 
efficiency of CT dechlorination, the solubility of Cu(II) ion at neutral pH is quite low 
compared to the added concentration. To verify the precipitated concentration of Cu(II) at pH 
7.2 (50 mM HEPES buffer), the soluble Cu(II) concentration was determined by filtering the 
  84 
reported that the sorption of Cu(II) onto ferrihydrite occurs simultaneously with 
chemisorption in which Cu(II) ions infiltrated into the lattice of the ferrihydrite structure.62   
Also, coincidental sorption and precipitation of Cu (II) on ferrihydrite was observed at a 
concentration of 0.06 mM.61  In this study, however, only dissolved Cu(II) existed in the 
solution because the equilibrium concentration of Cu(II) were all lower than 0.1mM, the 
thresholds value for the dissolved Cu(II) in solution (Figure 2-21), and the sorption of Cu(II) 
onto ferrihydrite could be fitted with Langmuir isotherm, which is consistent with the reported 
result.61 
The sorption behavior of Cu(II) onto magnetite is different from those onto other iron 
oxides.  As depicted in Figure 2-22d, a linear relationship between equilibrium concentration 
and sorbed concentration was exhibited, which can be assigned to be a Freundlich-type 
isotherm with n equal to unity.  It is worth mentioning that both sorption of Fe(II) and Cu(II) 
onto magnetite shows linear relationship that is different from the other iron oxide minerals.  
The chemical state of magnetite also different from other iron oxides having both Fe(II) and 
Fe(III) in the structure.  The reduction of transition metal ions including Cu(II)  by Fe(II) in 
magnetite has been observed.63  Therefore, the different sorption behavior could be attributed 
to the changes in the mineral surface during the later stage of the incubation due to redox 
reaction. Other possibility is reduced Cu specie on the magnetite may have more attraction on 
the Cu(II) in the aqueous phase.

2.4 ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE 
In this study, Fe(II) associated with iron oxides were used to dechlorinate carbon 
tetrachloride(CT).  The reactivity of surface-bound Fe(II) species on the dechlorination was 
Fe(III) oxide-dependent.  Comparison of the CT dechlorination by Fe(II) associated with  iron 
oxides using normalized surface area rate constant (ksa) shows that crystalline iron oxides are 
more reactive than amorphous ferrihydrite.  Goethite has the highest reductive capability in 
dechlorinating chlorinated methanes, while ferrihydrite shows the lowest dechlorination 
efficiency.  The chlorinated product generated during reductive transformation of CT shows 
that the formation ratio of CF varies form 14 % to 57 %, which is dependent on the iron oxide 
minerals.  This depicts that the natural attenuation of chlorinated contaminants by abiotic 
transformation may be varied in the subsurface environments, which contain various iron 
oxides.  In addition, the availability of Cu(II) ions can significantly enhance the 
dechlorination processes, which is important to facilitate the engineered systems for the 
coupled treatment of inorganic and organochloride.  In the presence of copper ions, not only 
the CT but also the major chlorinated product, chloroform (CF), could be dechlorinated into 
non-chlorinated or less chlorinated products.  Chloroform has been known to be resistant in 
surface-bound Fe(II) systems according to previous studies.(Kim and Picardal 1999; 
Amonette, Workman et al. 2000; Pecher, Haderlein et al. 2002)  This result shows the positive 
impact on natural attenuation when using surface-bound iron species as the natural reductant.  
The decrease in the reactivity observed during the re-spike of CT in this study is mainly due 
to the deactivation of most reactive surface-bound Fe(II) species during the first part of the 
dechlorination process(Pecher, Haderlein et al. 2002).  However, the reactive Fe(II) species 
are regenerated continuously by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria(Klausen, Trober et al. 
1995; Kim and Picardal 1999).  However, the effects of major environmental parameters on 
  90 
CT was observed in the presence of 3mM Fe(II)  using various concentrations of goethite ( 5 
∼ 25 mM). Addition of 0.5 mM Cu(II) in to 10mM iron oxide increase the kobs for 119, 100, 
30  and 3 times in the magnetite, goethite, hematite and ferrihydrite suspensions, respectively.

REDUCTIVE DECHLORINATION OF CARBON 
TETRACHLORIDE BY SURFACE-BOUND FERROUS 
IONS ASSOCIATED WITH GOETHITE 
 
 
  96 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
Chlorinated hydrocarbons are one of the major contaminants in soils and groundwaters1, 
2.  The dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons by iron species has recently received much 
attention.  In many of natural environments, the oxygen supply is limited, but iron oxides 
preset as an alternative electron acceptor.  The use of iron species to reduce chlorinated 
hydrocarbons is of great advantage because iron oxides bind with aqueous and solid-phase 
Fe(II) species are natural reductants and are abundant in many hydromorphic soils and 
subsurface environments.3 
Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated the importance of iron species in the 
reductive transformation of organic and inorganic compounds.4-14  Minerals containing 
structural Fe(II) such as green rust and magnetite were found to reduce several classes of 
priority pollutants including halogenated hydrocarbons5-10, nitroaromatic compounds 11, 12, as 
well as inorganic ions.13,14  Moreover, the systems containing dissolved Fe(II) and various 
iron oxides also showed a high reactivity with respect to chlorinated hydrocarbons under 
anoxic conditions 4, 15-17.  It is generally believed that ferrous iron associated with iron oxides 
is much more reactive than the dissolved Fe(II).4, 11, 12, 15  The high reactivity of heterogeneous 
Fe(II)/Fe(III) system can be maintained over a long period of time because of the continuous 
generation of surface bound Fe(II) species by the uptake of Fe(II) from the aqueous phase4.  
Several factors including pH value, surface density of Fe(II), available surface area of iron 
minerals, and contact time of Fe(II) with minerals have been shown to influence the reactivity 
of Fe(II) species bound with iron oxides.4, 16, 17  Amonette et al.17 dechlorinated CT in Fe(II)-
amended goethite system and found that the density of sorbed Fe(II) over goethite surface was 
the major factor on which the rate of dechlorination was dependent.  More recently, Hofstetter 
et al.18 showed that the various types of Fe(II) species on clays minerals influenced the 
reducing efficiency and the rate of nitroaromatic compounds.  Both structural Fe(II) and Fe(II) 
  98 
oxyhydroxide minerals in the natural environment and is widely used to remove trace 
organics and metal ions.22, 31  Moreover in the comparison with other iron oxides, goethite 
showed higher reactivity (chaper-1).  Transition metal ions including Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) 
and Zn(II) were selected due to their availability and abundance in natural and contaminated 
environments.  The chemical states of transition metals in iron oxides were characterized by 
using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffractometer (XRPD) 
techniques.  The, effects of pH and concentrations of Fe(II) and Cu(II) on CT dechlorination 
were examined to understand the role of transition metal ions in  the dechlorination reaction 
under iron-reducing condition. 
 
3.2   MATERIALS AND METHODS 
3.2.1 Chemicals.  All chemicals were used as received without further treatment. Carbon 
tetrachloride (CT) (> 99.8 %, GC grade), chloroform (CF) (> 99.8 %, GC grade), CuCl2.2H2O 
(99%), NiCl2.6H2O (98%), CoCl2.2H2O (99%) and ZnCl2 (98%), were purchased from Merck 
Co. (Darmstadt, Germany).  FeCl2.4H2O (99%), FeCl3.6H2O (99%), N-(2-hydroxyethyl) 
piperazine-N’-(2-ethanosulfonic acid (HEPES buffer) (99.5%), and 2- (N-Morpholino) 
ethanesulfonic acid (MES buffer) (> 99.5%) were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich Co. 
(Milwaukee, WI).  Methylene chloride (DCM) (> 99.8 %, GC grade) and ethanol (HPLC 
grade) were obtained from J. T. Baker Co. (Phillipsburg, NJ). Bathocuproinedisulfonic acid 
disodium salt (C26H18N2Na2O6S2) (90%) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).  
Goethite was synthesized according to Schwertmann and Cornell (32) and was characterized 
by XRPD. The XRD pattern showed major peaks at 21.25°, 33.3°, 36.65° and 53.3° 2θ which 
proved that the material synthesized was goethite.  The surface area of goethite, determined 
by BET N2 adsorption surface area analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2000). The powder 
sample of goethite was degassed with N2 (99.999%) and vacuumed (5 × 10-3 mmHg) 
  100 
species identification.  The suspension was transferred into a 50-mL centrifuge tube using N2-
purged syringe, and was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min.  After the supernatants were 
removed, the residue was dried with nitrogen gas and transferred to a 4-ml glass vial 
anaerobically.  The glass vial was stored under nitrogen atmosphere in a tightly sealed 
vacuum desiccator until analysis.    
 
3.2.3 Analytical Methods.   
The headspace analytical technique was used to determine the chlorinated hydrocarbons.  
The concentrations of CT and the byproducts in the gas phase of the test bottles were 
monitored withdrawing 50 µL of headspace using a 100 µL gas-tight glass syringe.  The 
mixture was then immediately injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame 
ionization detector (FID) and an electron capture detector (ECD) (Perkin-Elmer, Autosystem, 
Norwalk, CT).  A 60 m VOCOL fused-silica megabore capillary column (0.545 mm × 3.0 µm, 
Supelco Co.) was used for separating the chlorinated compounds.  The column was connected 
to FID and ECD simultaneously by a Y-splitter with 40 % of the flow (1.85 mL min-1) to 
ECD for better identifying and quantifying the chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The column 
temperature was maintained at 50 ºC isothermally with nitrogen (N2) as the carrier gas.  The 
relative standard deviation (RSD) for GC analysis was controlled within 10 %.  The serum 
bottles were opened after the headspace analysis and pH was measured using a 
microprocessor pH meter. 
The non-chlorinated compounds (methane) resulting from CT reduction were monitored by 
using a Varian 3800 GC equipped with a mass spectrometry (MS) (Saturn 2000) and an FID.  
Two capillary columns, a PLOT (Chrompack, 50 m × 0.32 mm × 5.0 µm) and a DB-1 (J&W, 
60 m × 0.32 mm × 1.0 µm), were connected in parallel by a Y-splitter with approximately 1/3 
  102 
Concentration of Cu(I) was determined by using bathocuproinedisulfonic acid method with 
minor modifications (37).  The aliquot was withdrawn by 1 mL N2-purged plastic syringe and 
filtered through 0.2 µm membrane filter.  0.2 mL of supernatants was then added into a 1.5 
mL vial containing 0.5 mL of 1 % bathocuproinedisulfonic acid solution and 1mL of 10% 
tartrate solution.  The total volume was adjusted to 1 ml and centrifuged at 8,000 g for 5 min.  
The aqueous Cu(I) concentration was then determined at 483 nm.  Standard solutions of Cu(I) 
were prepared by using 10 % hydroxylammonium chloride as a reductant to reduce CuCl2 
solutions.  Dissolved and total concentrations of copper species were determined using 
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Perkin Elmer, Optima 
3000XL).  The concentrations of copper ions attached to the solid-phase were calculated from 
the difference between total and dissolved concentrations. 
 
3.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSION 
3.3.1 Effect of transition metal ions on CT degradation.   
Figure 3-1 illustrates the dechlorination of CT and the production of chloroform (CF) 
by surface bound iron species in the presence of different metal ions.  Ferrous iron species 
attached to solid surfaces are reported to be more reactive in dechlorination reactions 
compared to its dissolved form.4,11,12,15-17  Results of the present study also showed the similar 
trend.  Although Fe(II) ion is thermodynamically capable of dechlorinating CT 38, no obvious 
degradation of CT by 3 mM of Fe(II) was observed within 10 days at neutral pH.  In the 
presence of goethite (25.6 m2 L-1) and 3 mM Fe(II), however, 92 % of CT degradation with 
the concomitant increase in CF concentration was observed.  Chloroform was identified as the 
major product.  Trace amounts of dichloromethane (DCM) and methane were also identified 
by GC-MS after the experimental course of 30 days. 
  104 
Different effects of transition metals on the dechlorination of CT by Fe(II) bound goethite was 
observed. An obvious difference between CT reduction by Fe(II) in the presence and absence 
of metal ions was observed after 48h when the F-test was applied (p < 0.05). As depicted in 
Figure 3-1, addition of 0.5 mM Zn(II) into the heterogeneous Fe(II)/Fe(III) system decreased 
the dechlorination efficiency of CT and only 76 % of CT was removed within 10 days.  The 
maximum concentration of CF was 4.5 µM.  Addition of Ni(II) and Co(II) decreased the 
dechlorination of CT at first stage, but the dechlorination efficiency and the production of CF 
were slightly enhanced after 96 h.  Of interest, CT was rapidly dechlorinated to CF in the 
presence of Cu(II).  Nearly complete removal of CT with rapid accumulation of CF was 
observed within 6 h.  The maximum concentration of CF was up to 10.8 µM and then slightly 
decreased to 8.5 µM followed by the increase of DCM and tetrachloroethene in trace amounts.  
The concentration of DCM increased very slowly and a maximum concentration of 1.35 µM 
was obtained during the incubation of 10 days.  The low carbon recovery may be due to the 
formation of non-chlorinated compounds that can not be detected by GC-ECD. When GC-MS 
was employed to identify the intermediate of CT (1mM) methane dichloromethane and 
tetrachloroethene were identified. A recent study39 also showed that carbon monoxide, 
methane, ethane, ethylene were the final products in CT dechlorination by green rust amended 
with Cu(II). This implies that processes other than reductive dechlorination are also involved 
in CT dechlorination in the Cu(II)-amended Fe(II)/Fe(III) system. Moreover, no obvious CT 
degradation was observed when the goethite suspension contained only Cu(II), depicting that 
Cu(II) associated goethite without Fe(II) ions has little effect on the dechlorination of CT.  
 
 
  106 
relative to the un-amended system was obtained in the 0.5 mM Cu(II)-amended suspension, 
showing that the addition of Cu(II) can significantly enhance the dechlorination rate of CT. 
The effect of metal ions complexed with macromolecules acting as active electron transfer 
mediators in the reduction of contaminants in the presence of various bulk reductants have 
been recently studied in both heterogeneous and homogeneous systems.31, 40-42  A common 
result shows that the degradation rate and efficiency the of chlorinated compounds increase 
with the addition of certain transition metal ions into systems containing bulk reductants and 
macromolecules.  Recent studies observed that the dechlorination rate of hexachloroethane in 
heterogeneous systems of sulfur-containing iron mineral (mackinawite) increased in the 
presence of Cu (II).43, 44  White and Peterson14 reported that the structural Fe(II) in Fe(II)-
bearing minerals can be oxidized by soluble Cu(II) species.  However, the role of Cu(II) in the 
dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbon under iron-reducing conditions is not well-
understood.  In this study, the efficiency and the rate of CT dechlorination by surface 
mediated goethite system increased greatly when Cu(II) was presented.  To further elucidate 
the possible mechanisms of Cu(II) on CT dechlorination, the effect of pH and surface 
characterization of solid phase were performed. 
 
3.3.2 Effect of pH on CT dechlorination.   
The pH value plays an important role in the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds 
in heterogeneous Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems.  Figure 3-2 illustrates the effect of pH on the 
dechlorination of CT in the presence of surface bound iron species with 0.5 mM Cu(II).  The 
pH values were in the range of 4.0 ∼8.5.  MES buffer was selected to control the pH at  pH 
5.5 ∼6.5, while HEPES buffer was used at pH 7.0 ∼ 8.0 and TRIS buffer was used to control 
pH at 8.5.  In the un-buffered system, the initial pH was 4.0 and the rate constant (kobs) for CT 
degradation was 0.008 h-1.  The increase in pH value enhanced both the efficiency and the rate

mM Cu(II) and 3 mM Fe(II) added 10 mM goethite suspension. The error bars indicate the 
standard deviation (n=3). The error bar shown at pH 6 is not observable being smaller than the 
size of the legend.   
 
  110 
To further understand the characteristics of the precipitate generated in the absence of goethite 
in the buffered system at pH 7, XRD and XPS were used to identify the crystal phase and 
chemical structures of the precipitate.  As shown in Figure 3-3,  the XRD pattern showed 
clear peaks at 36.42°, 42.22°, 61.30° 2θ and XPS spectra  also showed a peak at 932.0 eV (Cu 
2p3/2) .  These results clearly show that cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was formed in the precipitate.  
The Fe 2P 3/2 spectrum showed a peak at 710.8 eV, indicating that Fe(III)OFe(III) is 
substantial.  However, no XRD peak of iron oxide was observed, which suggests that poorly 
crystalline ferric oxide, ferrihydrite (Fe(OH)3), could be formed.  This means that the aqueous 
CuCl2 reacts with FeCl2 to form Cu2O and ferrihydrite at neutral pH according to the 
following relationship:  
 
 2 Fe 2+   +  2 Cu 2+   +  7 H2O  Æ  Cu2O + 2 Fe(OH)3   +  8 H+            (3-2) 
 
According to equation (3-2), 1 mol of Cu(II) can react with 1 mol of Fe(II) to form catalytic 
Cu(I) ion.  Also, 4 mol of proton are released into the solution.  At high concentration of 
Cu(II), the release of large amount of proton lowered the pH value of the solution, 
subsequently decreasing the extent and the rate of CT dechlorination. 
 
3.3.3  Effect of Cu (II) concentration on CT dechlorination.   
To further understand the effect of Cu(II) concentration on the  efficiency and the rate 
of CT dechlorination and the change in the pH of solution, various concentrations of Cu(II) 
ranging from 0.1 to 4 mM were added into solutions that contained 3 mM of Fe(II) and 10 
mM goethite at pH 7. Figure 3-4 illustrates the dechlorination efficiency and the rate constants 
of CT by surface bound Fe(II) species in the presence of various concentrations of

Cu(II).  The addition of low concentrations of Cu(II) ranging from 0.1 ∼0.5 mM greatly 
enhanced the efficiency and the rate of CT dechlorination.     The kobs increased rapidly from 
0.363 h-1 at 0.1 mM Cu(II) to 1.294 h-1 at 0.4 mM, and then slightly decreased to 1.143 h-1 
when Cu(II) was at 1 mM.  Further increasing Cu(II) concentration, however, lowered the 
dechlorination efficiency and only 20 % of CT was dechlorinated when Cu(II) concentrations 
were up to 3 mM.  Little degradation of CT was observed as Cu(II) concentration increased to 
4 mM.  This decrease in dechlorination efficiency at high Cu(II) concentrations may be 
attributed to the change in the pH value of the solution.   As shown in Figure 4-4 b, the pH

 To further study the oxidation of Fe(II) by Cu(II), total and dissolved Fe(II)

mM within 12 h with the addition of 0.5 mM Cu(II), while only 0.03 mM of Fe(II) was

Cu(II) has a higher sorption affinity onto goethite.45  The added Cu(II) would sorb over 
goethite surface leading to a decrease in the dissolved concentration and oxidation capability 
of Cu(II). To elucidate the relationship of Cu(II) and Fe(II) concentrations on CT 
dechlorination, another independent experiment was performed. Various concentration of 
Cu(II) ranging from 0.1 to 4.0 mM were added to homogeneous solution containing 3 mM 
Fe(II) without goethite. PH values of solutions were adjusted to pH 7 by using anoxic solution 
of NaOH under N2 atmosphere. After 20h of equilibrium, 20 µM of CT was injected to start 
  118 
additional reductant, 3mM Cu2O was amended into the Fe(II)-goethite suspensions at pH 7. A 
nearly complete dechlorination of CT within 10 h was observed, indicating that Cu2O is 
having catalytic activity for the dechlorination of CT. The kobs for CT dechlorination was five 
times higher than that without Cu(I), proving that Cu(I) is an effective species for the 
dechlorination of CT. 
 
3.3.4 Effect of Fe(II) on CT dechlorination.   
The dechlorination rates of CT in Cu(II)-amended Fe(II)-Fe(III) suspension was found 
to be influenced both by Cu(II) and Fe(II) concentrations.  Therefore, various concentrations 
of Fe(II) were added into the goethite system containing 0.5 mM Cu(II) to understand the 
influence of Fe(II) concentration on CT dechlorination.  Figure 3-9 shows the degradation 
efficiency and the rate constant of CT with the amendment of various concentrations of Fe(II).  
The dechlorination efficiency of CT increased with increasing Fe(II) concentration.  Only 27 
% of CT was dechlorinated within 12 h in the 0.5 mM Fe(II)-amended system, while nearly 
complete degradation of CT was observed when the Fe(II) concentration was higher than 1 
mM.   Also, the kobs for CT dechlorination increased from 0.029 h-1 at 0.5 mM to 0.949 h-1 at 
1.5 mM and then leveled off to 1.175 h-1 at 3.0 mM, reflecting that the addition of 1.5 mM of 
Fe(II) is sufficient for CT dechlorination in Fe(II)-goethite suspension with 0.5 mM Cu(II).  
Because the dechlorination of CT on surface bound Fe(II) system is a surface-
mediated reaction, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics can be used to describe the relationship 
between the Fe(II) concentration and the reaction rate:

where kobs is the rate constant of dechlorination reaction, krxn is the apparent reaction rate 
constant, KFe is the equilibrium constant for adsorption of Fe (II) to goethite, and CFe is the 
initial aqueous concentration of Fe (II).  In this study, the added Fe(II) reacted with Cu(II) and 
the initial concentration of Fe(II) decreased before the  injection of CT.  Therefore, the 
measured Fe(II) concentrations were used as the initial aqueous concentration of Fe(II).  A 
good fit between the Fe(II) concentration and the kobs with kapp and KFe of   1.141 h-1 and 
1.66mM-1, respectively, was obtained (r2 = 0.981, n = 6), which indicates  that Fe(II) serves as 
the bulk reductant for CT dechlorination (Figure 3-8b).  Moreover, the rate constant (kobs) for 
CT dechlorination was linearly correlated with the concentration of surface-bound Fe(II), 
showing that the sorption density of Fe(II) at the surface of iron oxide is a critical factor when 
evaluating the transformation rate of CT by  surface-bound Fe(II) species (Figure 3-9c).  
 
3.4  ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE   
Although the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated methanes by the surface 
mediated Fe(II) species under anoxic conditions has been investigated for several years, the 
influence of transition elements on the dechlorination reaction under natural iron reducing 
conditions is not well-understood. Copper species have been used as catalysts for 
dechlorination reactions in laboratory scale as well as in the pilot plan.46   Previous studies39,47, 
48  have shown that the addition of Cu2+ greatly enhanced the dechlorination rate of CT and 
CF by green rust.  Transformation of dichloroacetylene to chloroacetylene and then to 
acetylene in solutions containing cuprous chlorides (CuCl) was also observed at temperature 
of 67 – 87 οC.30 Recently, Chien et al49 observed that CT degradation was catalyzed by Cu(II) 
at temperatures higher than 300 οC.  In this study, it was demonstrated that the addition Cu(II) 
within the concentration range of 0.1 ∼0.5 mM can significantly enhance the dechlorination 
efficiency and the rat of CT by surface bound Fe(II) species in goethite suspensions at pH7.

amended solutions with a kobs of 0.0057 h-1 at pH 4.3 to 0.856 h-1 at pH 8.5, that was16 times 
greater than  kobs in the Fe(II) solutions without Cu(II).  The high reactivity of dissolved Fe(II) 
on the dechlorination of CCl4 in the presence of Cu(II) under anoxic conditions may enhance 
our understanding of the role of Fe(II) with dissolved Cu(II) and the long-term reactivity of 
natural  zerovalent iron system in the dechlorination processes for chlorinated organic 
contaminants . 
 
4.1  INTRODUCTION 
Chlorinated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), chloroform (CHCl3) and 
trichloroethylene (TCE) are the most frequently found contaminants in soil and groundwater 
1,2.  Due to their prevalent occurrence in the environment as well as their high toxicity to 
human beings and ecosystems, studies have been conducted to elucidate the kinetics and 
mechanisms of dechlorination of these compounds in contaminated sites 3,4.  Recently, the 
rapid dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the presence of Fe(II) species as 
environmental reductants under anoxic conditions has been reported 5-10.  Fe(II) species can 
be present in subsurface environment in a wide variety of forms including dissolved, soluble 
complexes, surface-bound and structural component in Fe(II)-bearing minerals11.  Studies 
show that ferrous ion associated with Fe(III)-containing minerals can significantly reduce 
several pollutants, including nitroaromatics, polyhalogenated alkanes, chloroamine 
compounds and carbamate pesticides5-10, 12-17.  The degradation rate and efficiency is 
dependent on environmental conditions such as pH value, surface density of Fe(II), available 
surface area of ferric oxides, and the presence of transition metal ions. 
Besides the surface-bound iron species, the dissolved ferrous species is also an ubiquitous 
component in contaminated groundwater and plays an important role in redox processes under 
reducing environments18, 19.  Aqueous Fe(II) is also known as a reducing agent that can 
  132 
diffraction (XRPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to identify the crystal 
phases and the morphologies of the precipitates generated from the reaction of Fe(II) and 
Cu(II) in aqueous solutions. 
 
4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
4.2.1 Chemicals.   
All chemicals were used as received without further treatment. Carbon tetrachloride 
(CT) (> 99.8%, GC grade), chloroform (CF) (> 99.8%, GC grade), tris (hydroxymethyl) 
aminomethane (Tris buffer), CuCl2.2H2O(99%) were purchased from Merck Co. (Darmstadt, 
Germany).  FeCl2.4H2O (99%), FeCl3.6H2O (99%), N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N’-2-
ethanosulfonic acid (HEPES buffer) (99.5%), 2-[N-Morpholino]ethanosulfonic acid (MES)(> 
99.5%) and sodium tatrate-2-hydrate (C4H4Na2O6. 2H2O) (> 99.5 %) were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Milwaukee, WI).  Methylene chloride (DCM) (> 99.8%, GC grade) and 
ethanol (HPLC grade) were obtained from J. T. Baker Co. (Philipsburg, NJ). 
Bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt (C26H18N2Na2O6S2) (90%) was purchased from 
Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).  All the solutions were prepared using distilled deionized water 
(Millipore, 18.3 mΩ) and were deoxygenated in vacuum sealed bottles under an N2 
atmosphere 9, 25, 26.  
 
4.2.2 Dechlorination Experiments  
Batch experiments were conducted using 70 mL serum bottles filled with 50 mL of 
deoxygenated buffer solutions under anoxic conditions.  Anoxic HEPES (50 mM) buffer 
solutions were used to control pH at 7.0 ± 0.1.  Anoxic solutions were prepared by purging 
N2(99.9995%) with flow rate at 42 Lmin-1 followed by vacuuming in sealed bottles. This 
process was repeated five times 9, 25, 26.  Stock solutions of Fe(II) were prepared in 50 mL of 
  134 
tight syringe.  The mixture was then injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) (Perkin-Elmer, 
Autosystem) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an electron capture detector 
(ECD).  A 60-m VOCOL fused-silica megabore capillary column (0.545 mm × 3.0 µm, 
Supelco Co.) was used to separate the chlorinated compounds.  The column was connected to 
FID and ECD simultaneously by a Y-splitter with 40 % of the flow (1.85 ml/min) to ECD to 
better identify and quantify the chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The column temperature was 
isothermally maintained at 90ºC with nitrogen (N2, > 99.9995% ) as the carrier gas.  The 
relative standard deviation (RSD) for GC analysis was controlled within 10 % in ECD and 5 
% in FID. The limits of detection for CCl4 and CHCl3 by GC for the used method were 0.4 
µM and 0.1µM respectively.   After headspace analyses, serum bottles were opened under N2 
atmosphere, and pH and redox potential were measured using a Microprocessor pH meter 
equipped with pH electrode and ORP combination electrode. 
XRPD was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Regaku D/max-II B) and a Cu 
Kα-radiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å) with 30 kV voltage and 20 mA current to identify the 
crystal phases of the precipitates.  The precipitates were allowed to settle down after the 
termination of dechlorination experiment and the supernatant was carefully removed from the 
sealed bottles using N2–purged syringe.  After drying the precipitates by a gentle stream of N2, 
samples were mounted on a glass sample holder using small amounts of grease.  A drop of 
glycerol was immediately added on the mounted powder layer to minimize the exposure in air.  
The scan range for all samples was between 5 and 90° (2θ) at a scanning speed of 4°/min.  
Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Topcon ABT-150s) was used to identify the 
morphology of the precipitates. 
Concentrations of HCl extractable Fe(II) in the serum bottles were monitored by 
withdrawing 0.5 mL of suspension using N2-purged syringes. The aliquotes were immediately 
acidified with 1 M HCl 26.  The acidified samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to 
  136 
concentration of 3mM.  No obvious dechlorination ofCCl4 by 3 mM Fe(II) was observed in 
the absence of Cu(II).  Addition of low concentrations of Cu(II) significantly enhanced the 
dechlorination of CCl4.  The dechlorination efficiency of CCl4 by Fe(II) increased with 
increasing Cu(II) concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 mM.  Further increase in Cu(II) 
concentration lowered the dechlorination efficiency of CCl4, and only 35 % of initial CCl4 
was removed within 12 h when Cu(II) concentration was increased to 4 mM.  This decrease in 
dechlorination efficiency at high Cu(II) concentrations may be attributed to the decrease in pH 
values and the increase in redox potentials.  When the Cu(II) concentration increased, the 
Fe(II) concentration could decrease by oxidizing to Fe(III) releasing protons as that will be 
discussed latter.  Moreover, hydrolysis of Cu(II) ions also can release protons to the solution.  
Because of the both decrease in pH and oxidation of some Fe(II), the redox potential 
decreased lowering the  dechlorination efficiency9.  As depicted in Figure 4-1b, the pH value 
was maintained at 7.0 ± 0.2 after 12 h in the Cu(II) concentration range of 0 – 0.5 mM, while 
the pH value decreased to 5.5 when the concentration was up to 4 mM.  Also, the redox 
potentials of the solutions increased from – 350 mV in the absence of Cu(II) to + 100 mV at 4 
mM Cu(II).  Maithreepala and Doong 9 depicted that 4 mol of protons could be released into 
the solution when 1 mol of Cu(II) reacted with 1 mol of Fe(II).  Since Fe(II) was oxidized to 
Fe(III) by Cu(II), the pH and redox potential of the solution changed significantly when a 
high concentration of Cu(II) was amended into the solution. 
 
4.3.2 Concentration effect of Fe(II) on CCl4 dechlorination in the presence of 0.5 mM 
Cu(II).    
Figure 4-2 shows the dechlorination of CCl4 and the production of chloroform (CHCl3) 
in the presence of various concentrations of Fe(II) and 0.5 mM Cu(II).  The dechlorination 
efficiency of CCl4 increased from 15 % at 0.5 mM to 93 % at 2 mM within 24 h.  A nearly

Fe(II) concentrations in the presence of 0.5 mM Cu(II) at pH 7.  The kobs increased slightly 
from 0.007 to 0.252 h-1 when the initial Fe(II) concentrations increased from 0.5 to 3 mM 
(Figure 4-3a).  Further increase in Fe(II) concentration dramatically increased the 
dechlorination rate.  The kobs for CCl4 dechlorination was 4 - 7 times higher than that with 3 
mM Fe(II) when the initial Fe(II) concentrations were in the range of 4 – 5 mM.  The increase 
in kobs at high Fe(II) concentration is probably due to the formation of precipitates when 
anoxic solutions contained  both Fe(II) and Cu(II) 9: 
 
2 Fe2+ + 2 Cu2+ + 7 H2O Æ Cu2O + 2 Fe(OH)3  + 8 H+           (4-2) 
 
According to equation (4-2), an amorphous ferrihydrite with cuprous oxide was formed 
when the molar ratio between Fe(II) and Cu(II) is 1.  At high concentration of Fe(II), the 
excess ferrous ion would adsorb onto the surface of ferric oxide to form surface-bound iron 
species, and subsequently accelerates the dechlorination rate of CCl4 at neutral pH.  Table 4-1 
shows the changes in the concentrations of Fe(II), both in dissolved fraction and surface 
bound fraction determined after 24 h of the addition of various concentrations of Fe(II) into 
0.5 mM Cu(II) buffered solution. The extractable Cu(I) concentrations at each systems are 
also shown in Table 4-1.  The total extractable Cu(I) concentrations, except the 0.5 mM 
Fe(II)-amended solution, were in the range of 0.41 – 0.43 mM, implying that similar amounts 
of ferric oxides were produced. The lower recovery Cu(I) in the solution with 0.5 Fe(II) might 
be due to incomplete reduction of Cu(II).  In contrast, the surface-bound Fe(II) concentrations 
increased with increasing initial Fe(II) concentration, which was in a good agreement with the 
kobs.

fixed to Fe(III)-containing mineral surfaces, resulting in the formation of different 
morphologies of Fe(III) oxides after a relative long contact time 5, 28, 29.  Jeon et al.28 observed 
the interactions of dissolved Fe(II) with hematite surface which transformed to magnetite after 
a relative long time.  Satapanajaru et al.30 also reported that ferrihydrite could react with Fe(II) 
to form magnetite.  In this study, the acid-extractable concentrations of Fe(II) in all batches 
were lower than the initial concentrations of Fe(II) after 24 h, and the difference in total Fe(II) 
between the measured and the added amounts increased with increasing initial Fe(II)  
concentration.   This shows the possibility of the fixation of Fe(II) and the change in mineral 
phase of amorphous ferric oxide to the crystalline ferric oxides at various Fe/Cu ratios.

the Fe(II)/Cu(II) Ratio of 4 that shown in Figure 4-5.  When the concentration ratio of 
Fe(II)/Cu(II) was increased to 6 still needle like goethite particles are observable with small 
particle size. Increase in particle size may be one reason to increase the surface area to sorb 
more Fe(II) that can increase the rate and efficiency of CCl4 dechlorination.  If the 
concentration ratio was further increase to 10 the needle like particles are not observable in 
the SEM image of the mixture (Figure 4-4D) agreeing with the evidence in XRD patter in 
Figure 4-5 that shows no apparent peaks in the solid phase if the Fe(II)/Cu(II) ratio was 10.  
This means formation of amorphous mineral phase with very small particle size (Figure 4-4D 
and Figure 4-5) forms high concentration of surface bound Fe(II) that can increase the 
dechlorination of CCl4.

concentrations at neutral pH.  The stoichiometric relations between  Fe(II) and Cu(II) were (a) 
1:1, (b) 4:1, (c) 6:1, and (d) 10:1.   
  146 
These results clearly show that the amendment of excess concentrations of Fe(II) in 
solutions containing Cu(II) can form different mineral phase with different morphologies of 
reactive surface-bound Fe(II) species, resulting in an acceleration of the dechlorination rate of 
CCl4.  However, no distinct peak was observed in XRD patterns when Fe/Cu ratios were 
increased to 8 –10 (Figure 4-5) presumably due to the presence of the amorphous oxides.  
Baltpurvins et al. 33 showed that the phase conversion from ferrihydrite to crystalline ferric 
oxides was significantly hampered in the presence of chloride ions.  In this study, the 
amendment of large amounts of Fe(II) as FeCl2 increased the concentration of chloride ion in 
the system, which may inhibit the formation of crystal minerals.  Since ferrihydrite has a 
larger specific surface area than those of magnetite and goethite, the formation of higher 
amounts of surface-bound Fe(II) species associated with ferrihydrite due to the sorption may 
increased the dechlorination rate of CCl4 at high Fe/Cu ratios.

4.3.4  Effect of pH.   
Since the pH may affect the formation of reactive chemogenic solids and the reactivity 
of surface sites on the Fe(III) mineral surfaces, the effect of pH on the dechlorination of CCl4 
was examined and the pH was maintained in the range of 5.5 – 8.5 with appropriate buffers.  
The un-buffered solution containing 3 mM Fe(II) and 0.5 mM Cu(II) at pH 4.5 was also used 
for comparison.  Moreover, parallel experiments in the absence of Cu(II) were conducted to 
elucidate the effect of possible precipitates on the dechlorination of CCl4.

used for pH 8.5. 
 
Figure 4-7 shows the effect of pH on the dechlorination of CCl4 by 3 mM Fe(II) in the

dechlorination of CCl4 was observed in the pH range of 5.5 – 7.0 (Figure 4-7a), which is 
similar to reported results7.  An obvious dechlorination of CCl4 by Fe(II) occurred under 
alkaline condition and the kobs for CCl4 dechlorination increased from 0.0097 h-1 at pH 7.5 to 
0.0946 h-1 at pH 8.5.  The concentrations of CHCl3 were in the range of 0.42 – 14.4 µM, 
which accounted for up to71 % of CCl4 dechlorination (Table 4-2).  In contrast to the system

0.44 – 0.5 mM, and the total Fe concentration determined by ICP-OES were 3.0 ± 0.15 mM

oxides. In un-buffered  system where the pH was 4.36 (Figure 4-8b) the sorbed Fe(II) as

4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE   
In natural anoxic environments, several biogeochemical redox processes may take place 
in parallel, giving rise to several potential reductants for the dechlorination of subsurface 
  154 
laboratory experimental results showed the effect of transition metal ions including Cu(II) on 
the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds by zerovalent iron46.  Also, studies have 
demonstrated the impact of transition metal ions on the dechlorination efficiency and rate of 
chlorinated hydrocarbons by surface-bound Fe(II) system associated with goethite9 and 
different structural Fe(II) minerals including green rust 38, 39 and mackinawite24.  The 
synergistic effect of dissolved Cu(II) and Fe(II) on the reduction of CCl4 shown in this study 
may enhance our understanding of the role of Fe(II) and the long-term reactivity of zerovalent 
iron systems in the dechlorination processes for chlorinated organic contaminants.  In 
conclusion, our results clearly show the high reactivity of dissolved Fe(II) on the 
dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride in the presence of Cu(II) ion under anoxic conditions.  
In the contaminated subsurface, the Fe(II) concentrations can be higher to 1.4 – 3 mM17.  This 
gives impetus to facilitate the development of processes that could be used for the coupled 
detoxification of chlorinated hydrocarbons and metal ions.

REDUCTIVE DECHLORINATION OF CARBON 
TETRACHLORIDE BY BIOGENIC FERROUS SPECIES 
UNDER MICROBIAL IRON REDUCING CONDITIONS 
BY Geobacter sulfurreducens 
 
  160 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Microbial reductive dehalogenation plays a vital role in the detoxification of the 
chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated ground water and soil. In this process, chlorinated 
hydrocarbons are served as terminal electron acceptors by bacteria (halorespiration) or 
undergone co-metabolic transformation.1  Laboratory and field studies have proven that 
reduction of organic pollutants may occur by non-biological (abiotic) chemical reactions in 
subsurface environments under anoxic condition.1,2  Recently, the biological processes of 
Fe(III) reduction coupling with the oxidation of organic matter by dissimilatory iron reducing 
bacteria (DIRB) have been shown to produce substantial amounts of Fe(II) and mixed-valence 
iron minerals such as magnetite (FeIIFeIII2O4) in the subsurface environments.3-5    Heijman et 
al. found that the biogenic magnetite produced by Fe(III) reduction process of Geobacter 
metallireducens could niroaromatic compounds.6  Also the reduction of nitro aromatic 
compounds due to the surface mediated abiotic reaction of Fe(II) species generated by DIRB 
in aquifer soil column was reported.7  Microbial dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction process 
regenerates Fe(II) species on the surface of iron minerals those are consumed by the reduction 
of contaminants such as  niroaromatic compounds and chlorinated compounds.7,8   The 
biological regeneration of Fe(II) species is necessary to continuously maintain the long-term 
reactivity of the surface-bound and structural Fe(II) species.  However, organic compounds 
are important as carbon source for DIRB for biological Fe(III) reduction.  It can be predicted 
that the Fe(III) reducing bacteria may easily grow in the  aquifers contaminated with organic 
compounds.   Agreeing with the prediction, elevated concentrations of Fe(II) and depletion of 
Fe(III) have been observed  in contaminated sediments and aquifers contained aromatic 
hydrocarbons in petroleum contaminated sites.9-12  It is generally believed that polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are resistant to biological degradation under anoxic conditions, 
but investigations showed that DIRB naphthalene to CO2 coupling to Fe(III) reduction.12  In 
  162 
reduce them.  However recent studies have suggested that electron-shuttling compounds may 
facilitate the need for the Fe(III) reducing bacteria to establish direct contact with Fe( III) 
oxides.21   Geobacter metallireducens, was found to have an alternative strategy to contact 
with Fe(III) by forming flagella and pili only when  they grow on insoluble Fe(III)oxide.22   
However, more recently it was found that geobactor species such as Geobacter 
metallireducens does not produce electron-shuttles or Fe(III) chelators.21   Therefore in the 
laboratory experiments related to bacterial Fe(III)oxide reduction, some electron shuttling 
compound are necessary to facilitate the reduction of Fe(III) minerals by dissimilatory iron 
reducing bacteria (DIRB) G. metallireducens or G. sulfurreducens.  
  Humic substances (humics) and the humics analogue, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate 
(AQDS), which were found to stimulate microbial reduction of synthetic poorly crystalline 
Fe(III) oxide under laboratory conditions.23,24   Moreover, a recent study found that cysteine 
an essential amino acid in living cells acts as electron carrier to stimulate the reduction of iron 
(III) oxides by G. sulfurreducens.25  Generally, cysteine is also amended in to strictly 
anaerobic microbial cultures to make O2-free conditions in many anaerobic microbial 
experiments. 
The major objective of this work was to study the abiotic reductive dechlorination of 
carbon tetrachloride (CT) by the biogenic Fe(II) species under the microbial Fe(III) reducing 
condition using Geobacter sulfurreducens and, to evaluate the effect of Cu ions on the 
dechlorination process   To study the effect of Cu(II) on the dechlorination, under the 
microbial Fe(III)-reducing condition it was prerequisite the study  of Cu(II) effect on the 
Fe(III) reduction by G. sulfurreducens. More than to the kinetics of CT dechlorination the 
priority of this study was given to possibilities for dechlorination.   Cysteine or AQDS was 
added into the system as electron shuttling compounds to increase the biological Fe(III)-
reduction. Only for the purpose of comparison, the possible microbial dechlorination of CT

(0.5g) for 1L of anoxic bicarbonate (30mM) buffer solution (1L). Sodium acetate 
(CH3COONa) and sodium fumarate (C4H2O4Na2) were added as electron donor and electron 
acceptor, respectively, to be the final concentration of  30mM and 20mM in the medium.  The 
bottle was tightly sealed using rubber lid and screw cap.   The  head-space was filled with 
N2/CO2 (80v/20v) and autoclaved.  After the solution was cooling to room temperature under 
the anoxic condition 1mL of the anoxic solution of trace elements, included with following 
concentrations (g L-1)  Fe(NH4)2(SO4).6H2O (0.8), CoCl2.6H2O (0.2), ZnSO4.7H2O (0.2 g), 
CuCl2.2H2O (0.02), NiCl2.6H2O (0.02), Na2MoO4.2H2O (0.02) and a 1mL of selenite-
tungstate solution (Na2SeO4,(0.02 gL-1) and Na2WO4) (0.02gL-1) were injected through 0.2 
µM pore sized sterile filtering membrane (PTFE).  Then, the medium was transferred in to 
50mL serum bottles those were vacuumed and sealed with rubber septum and open center 
aluminum crimp cap, using 50mL sterile airtight plastic syringe and needles in the sterile 
lamina-flow hood.   The total volume of the mineral medium transferred into serum bottle was 
about 45 mL remaining 5mL of headspace filled with N2/CO2 (80/20, v/v).  Then G. 
sulfurreducens was inoculated into culture medium and the serum bottles were incubated at 
25 ± 1 °C.  The bacterial growth was tested by optical density using light absorption at 660 
nm.  
 
5.2.3 Fe(III)) reduction experiments 
Biological Fe(III) reduction by G. sulfurreducens was carried out using poorly crystalline 
ferric oxide to study the biogenic Fe(II) mediated dechlorination of CT. Moreover, goethite 
and hematite also used to study the possible microbial Fe(III) reduction by G. sulfereducens . 
Serum bottles (70 mL) capped with Teflon lined rubber septum with open center aluminum 
crimp caps were used in iron reducing experiments.   Bacterial medium was prepared 
following the similar procedure used for the preparation for microbial culture using organic 
  166 
5.2.4 Dechlorination experiments 
Abiotic dechlorination of CT by biogenic Fe(II) species was studied by analysis of  the 
concentration of  CT in the Fe oxides amended serum bottles those were prepared by 
following the procedure as in Fe(III) reduction experiment. 3µM CT was injected as the target 
organic. The CT concentrations were determined periodically. Because cysteine and reduced 
form of quinone compounds can reduce chlorinated compounds,27,28  control experiments 
were performed to in the absence of bacteria.  In the similar way some serum bottles were 
treated by bacteria with acetate as electron donor without amended Fe(III) oxides to observe 
the possible  biological dechlorination of CT  as terminal electron acceptor. 
 
5.2.5 Analytical methods 
Analytical methods for Chlorinated products, Fe(II) concentration, and Cu(I) 
concentrations were similar to the methods described previously.   The availability of cysteine 
in Cu(II) solutions was  tested using 5, 5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)(DTNB) method.25,29   
Briefly, anoxic solution in the serum bottle was withdrawn by 1mL N2 purged syringe and 0.1 
mL of aliquots was mixed with 1mL anoxic solution of 1mM DTNB in 50 mM phosphate 
buffer.  The mixture was allowed to develop the color complex for 10min and measured the 
absorption by UV-Visible spectrophotometer at 412nm. This method can be used to detect the 
lowest concentration of 6 µM.    
After bacterial Fe(III) reduction in the ferrihydrite suspensions, the contents in the bottles 
were withdrawn by 50 mL syringe and injected into 50mL centrifuge tubes under N2-purge. 
The solid phase was separated by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 mins.  The solid-phase 
was dried with gentle purge of N2.  The crystal property of dried powder was analyzed by  
XRD (Regaku D/max-IIB) using Cu Kα-radiation source with 30kv voltage and 20 mA 
  168 
reduction was higher than that for goethite.26  Therefore, poorly crystalline Fe(III)oxide was 
used to study the effect of other factors such as carbon tetrachloride (CT) and Cu(II) on the 
biological Fe(II) reduction.

5.3.2 Abiotic reductive dechlorination of CT under microbial Fe(III) reducing condition  
Because the reductive dechlorination is mediated by Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems and the 
regeneration Fe(II) is required to form new reactive Fe(II), the simultaneous biological Fe(III) 
reduction and abiotic dechlorination catalyzed by  Fe(II)/Fe(III) system is needed.  Recent 
  170 
A parallel series of serum bottles was set up to understand CT reduction coupling to 
biogenic Fe(II) resulted by the reduction of various Fe(III) oxides by G. sulfurreducens . As 
shown in Figure 5-3, the concentrations of CT decreased with time in every Fe(III)-oxide 
system both in the presence and absence of G. sulfurreducens.  Particularly, the 
dechlorination of CT was higher in ferrihydrite (FH)-amended suspensions.  The 
concentrations of CT in FH systems with and without the amendment of bacteria were 0.25 
µM and 1.5 µM after 20d, respectively, which corresponded to 92 % and 58.84 % of CT 
dechlorination.  Interestingly, the CT concentration profiles in the goethite and hematite 
systems were similar in the presence and absence of bacteria, depicting that microbial activity 
is not significant in these two Fe(III) oxide systems.

3.3 mM CT to understand the effect of Cu(II) on the dechlorination of CT.  A significant 
increase in Fe(II) concentration was obtained in ferrihydrite system when 0.5 mM u(II) was 
added. The maximum concentration of Fe(II) was around 0.8 mM, which was higher than the 
blank control of 0.2 mM Fe(II).  An apparent decrease in Fe(II) concentration was observed in 
Cu(II)-amended systems when compared to Figure 5-1and 5-2 due to Cu(II) amendment. 
Figure 5-4 also illustrates that addition of CT amended system has a little effect on the 
production of Fe(II) concentration. However, biological Fe(III) reduction still seems possible 
in the presence of both CT and Cu(II).  Therefore CT dechlorination by biogenic e(II) also 
may be possible.

efficiency and rate of CT in the microbial system and the pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) 
was 0.2362d-1 (Table 5-2).  Similar to the microbial system both the rate and efficiency also 
increase in blank control system and   kobs was 0.1175 d-1.  Also, the enhanced ration of kobs in 
blank controls is higher than that in microbial batches (Table 5-2).  This decrease in the 
enhanced ratio of kobs may be due to the inhibition of microbial activity by Cu(II). The 
reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by the other reducing agent in the solution may be due to the 
inhibition of microbial activity by Cu(II). The reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by other reducing 
agent in the solution may be another possibility.  It could be an abiotic reaction catalyzed by 
the copper species complexed with the medium, the third assumption is microbial metabolism 
of CT in the presence of Cu(II).  
To clarify the possible reasons dechlorination of CT was studied in the absence of 
Fe(III) oxides with and without G. sulfurreducens in medium containing 30 mM acetate and 
0.5 mM cysteine at pH 7.  Figure 5-6 shows the effect of 0.5 mM Cu(II) on the dechlorination 
of CT by G. sulfurreducens without the addition of Fe(III)-oxides. In the absence of Cu(II) 
ion the CT concentration decreased to 2.5 µM and 2.8 µM after 20 d , which accounted for 
23% and 15% of the initial CT in bacterial and blank control system respectively.  The small 
difference in dechlorination efficiency of CT between DIRB-amended and un-amended 
systems indicate the little dechlorination capacity of G.sulfurreducens using CT as the sole 
electron acceptor.   Interestingly, in the presence of 0.5 mM Cu(II),  the dechlorination 
efficiency and rate significantly enhanced both in microbial system and blank control. Also 
the contribution of bacterial activity on the CT dechlorination is negligible compared to the 
blank control, Suggesting that copper complexed with the cysteine should be responsible for 
the abiotic CT dechlorination.39

Cu(II) before CT injection no detectable  cysteine concentration was found in the solution. 
The limit of detection (LOD) of DTNB method used to detect cysteine was 5 µM, showing 
that most cysteine was oxidized in to cystine,  by Cu(II).  The concentration of Cu(I) was 0.24 
mM, which is nearly similar to the concentration of added cysteine.  These results conclude 
that  the dechlorination of CT should be due to the formation of Cu(I)–cystine complex or 
Cu(I) species.  The reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) coupling to cysteine oxidation can be describe 
in equation (5-1).

In this experiment, low concentration of cysteine was used to understand the effect of 
the product of equation 5-1.  It was observed that in the blank controls which contained 
0.5mM cysteine did not dechlorinate CT implying that he product of reaction 5-1 is 
responsible for the dechlorination of CT.  However, equation (5-1) is a side reaction for CT 
dechlorination. The objective of this work is to study the dechlorination of CT by biogenic 
Fe(II) and  possible synergistic effect of Cu(II) in Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems.  Therefore, cysteine 
is not suitable to serve as an electron shuttling compound to increase the biological Fe(III) 
oxide reduction.   
 
5.3.5 Microbial reduction of Fe(III)oxides using  AQDS as electron shuttling compound 
Besides  cysteine, several quinone and related compounds23, 41 have been proven to act as 
electron shuttling compounds. 2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS) has found to be the 
most efficient electron shuttling compound that facilitated the reduction of insoluble Fe(III) 
oxides by G. metallireducens the first found dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB).23  
Latter studies found that quinone like compounds are excreted by DIRB in the process of

Figure 5-8.  Reduction of 10 mM Fe(III) oxides, by G. sulfurreducens in solution at pH 7.0 ± 
0.1.  The used ferric oxides were ferrihydrite (FH), goethite,(Goe), and hematite (Hem). 30 
mM acetate and 10 µM AQDS were added to serve as electron donor and electron shuttling 
compound, respectively. 
 
During FH reduction, the original brown color gradually transferred into black color, 
which indicates that the product mineral could be magnetite.  To confirm the mineral phase 
and to study the morphology of the product, the  separated solid phase was dried under N2 
atmosphere and characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM).  Figure 5-9 shows the XRD pattern of biogenic iron mineral-phase 
resulted from the microbial reduction of ferrihydrite using AQDS as electron shuttling 
compound to facilitate the Fe(III) reduction.  Figure 5-9 shows that the XRD pattern of the

Since all the Fe(III) oxides were reduced by microbial activity in the presence of 10µM 
AQDS, it is necessary to evaluate the microbial ability of Fe(II) reduction in the presence of 
CT.    A similar experimental system to the microbial Fe(III) reduction was used. 3.5 µM CT 
was injected into the serum bottles.  The Fe(II) concentrations shows in Figure 5-10 depicts 
that nearly 4.5 mM, 3.2 mM and 1.1 mM of Fe(II) were formed in ferrihydrite, hematite, and 
goethite systems respectively, during 24 d in the presence of CT and AQDS.  These 
concentrations were similar to those in the absence of CT (Figue6-8) revealing that the 
addition of CT has little effect on the microbial activity of G. sulfurreducens when was used 
as electron shuttling compound.

Figure 5-11.  Dechlorination of 3.5 µM CT under the biological Fe(III) reducing condition. 10 
mM Fe(III) oxides, ferrihydrite (FH), goethite (Goe), hematite (Hem) were reduced by G. 
sulfurreducens  at pH 7.  The system contained 30mM acetate and 10mM AQDS as electron 
donor and electron shuttling compound, respectively. 
 
According to Figure 5-11, the decrease in CT dechlorination followed two linear phases.  
This means that dechlorination does not obey first-order kinetics. This may probably be due to 
the increase in the reactive Fe(II) concentration by continuously formation of Fe(II) from 
biological Fe(III) reduction.  Chloroform (CF) was found as the major chlorinated product.

The effect of Cu(II) ions on the microbial Fe(III) reduction and the dechlorination of CT 
was further investigated.  Ferrihydrite was selected as the Fe(III) source to study the effect of 
Cu(II) on the microbial Fe(III) reduction because it is efficiently reducible by G. 
sulfurreducens.  Figure 5-13 shows the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite by G. 
sulfurreducens in the presence of Cu(II). The results of Fe(II) analysis in all the experimental 
series can be seen in Figure 5-13.   It is clear that, in the presence of Cu(II), the Fe(III) 
reduction is mainly contributed by biological reaction because  blank controls do not produce

To understand the concentration effect of added Cu(II) on the microbial Fe(III) reduction 
by G. sulfurreducens,  a series of experiments were carried out by adding various 
concentrations of Cu(II) (0.1 ∼ 0.6 mM ) into the anoxic suspensions containing 10 mM 
ferrihydrite (FH),  30 mM acetate and 10 µM AQDS  in the presence and absence of G.

Figure 5-17. Formation of Cu(I) in blank controls (without bacterial cells) contained 10 mM

mM acetate and 10 µM AQDS were also presence in the suspension.  
 
 The extractable Cu(I) concentrations in the serum bottles in the presence of various 
concentrations Cu(II) (0.1 ∼ 0.6 mM) were also determined (Figure 5-16 and 5-17).  The 
concentrations of extractable Cu(I)  in the bacterial system were in the range of 0.04 ∼0.15 
mM. While only 0.01∼ 0.02 mM Cu(I) were obtained in the blank control systems reflecting 
that a considerable concentration of Cu(I) was formed due to the microbial Fe(III) reduction 
in the Cu(II)  amended systems.  The low Cu(I) (< 0.02mM) in the batches without the

In order to study the kinetics of CT dechlorination by biogenic Fe(II) in  the presence of Cu(II)  
other experiment  with high concentration of CT was performed. At first, 10 mM ferrihydrite 
was allowed to reduce by G. sulfurreducens in the HEPES buffered medium at  pH7.0 ± 0.1 
in the presence of 30mM acetate and 10mM AQDS.  After incubation for two days, the Fe(II) 
concentrations were determined and were in the range of 2.58 ∼ 2.79 mM. Subsequently Cu(II) 
and CT were added to the batches to get the concentrations of 0.5 mM and  40 µM, 
respectively.  Figure 5-19 shows the dechlorination of 40 µM CT by biogenic Fe(II) oxides in 
the presence of 0.5 mM Cu(II).  In the absence of Cu(II), concentrations decreased from 40 
µM to 33.9 and 30.7 µM. When Fe(II) concentrations were 2.58 and 2.65 µM respectively 
depicting that only 15% ∼23% of initial CT  was dechlorinated within 72h by biogenic 
minerals without Cu(II).  Addition of 0.5 mM Cu(II)  significantly enhanced the efficiency 
and rate of CT dechlorination and 89% ∼ 98.5% of  the initial CT were dechlorinated during  
72 hours.  This disappearance followed first –order kinetics and  the values of  kobs  for CT 
dechlorination were within the range of 0.04 ∼ 0.05 h-1.    
In summary, the microbial Fe(III)-reduction can  catalyze the abiotic dechlorination  of 
chlorinated compounds significantly.  Addition of Cu(II) ions partially decrease the Fe(III) 
reducing efficiency by G. sulfurreducens.  However, the added Cu(II) can be reduced to Cu(I) 
by Fe(II) oxidation, and subsequently enhances the dechlorination rate significantly under the 
microbial Fe(III) reducing conditions.

  204 
The kobs for the CT dechlorination in Fe(II)-goethite system has linear relationship with 
the concentration of amended Cu(II) up to 0.5 mM and further increase of Cu(II) decrease the 
rate constant and decrease the pH of the system. The similar behavior was found even in the 
dissolved Fe(II) solution. Moreover, analysis of total Fe(II) in the suspension showed that 
Fe(II) has oxidized. The presence of Cu(I) in the suspension proved that Cu(II) was reduced 
to Cu(I) coupling with  Fe(II) oxidation.  This means new Fe(III) species and Cu(I) species 
are formed in the surface – bound Fe(II) system.  Concentration of Cu(I) species in the 
dissolved fraction was quite low. However, by filtering the suspension and testing for the 
dechlorination it was found that solid species are responsible for the enhanced dechlorination 
when Cu(II) was amended into goethite system. It also found that the surface-bound Fe(II) 
concentration in goethite suspension slightly increased although total Fe(II) concentration 
decrease.  When Fe(II) and Cu(II) solution were mixed under anoxic condition  the precipitate 
was formed. The analysis of solid-phase by XRD and XPS suggested that when Fe(II) 
oxidation coupling to Cu(II) reduction can mainly produce amorphous ferrihydrite and 
cuprous oxides(Cu2O). The catalytic activity of Cu2O in Fe(II)-goethite system also proved by 
adding pure Cu2O which showed that there is a catalyst effect in Cu2O if surface-bound Fe(II) 
is available in the system.  Using these result it was concluded that the enhanced 
dechlorination in Cu(II)-amended Fe(II)-iron oxide suspension is  due to formation of new 
solid phases including Fe(III) minerals that can increase the surface bound Fe(II) 
concentration and catalytic Cu(I). In the environmental point of view, this gives positive 
impetus for the remediation of chlorinated products and inorganic metal ions together with 
synergistic effect for the dechlorination process. 
The synergistic effect of Cu(II) in the Fe(II) solution was also investigated without 
amendment of Fe(III) oxides.  Either Fe(II) or Cu(II) solution did not dechlorinated CT  at 
neutral pH under anoxic condition. Similarly when two solutions were mixed in the molar
