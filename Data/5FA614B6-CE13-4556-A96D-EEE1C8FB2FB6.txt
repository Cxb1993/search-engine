Broadband Dielectric Resonator Antenna With Metal
Coating

Abstract—A broadband dielectric resonator (DR) antenna is
proposed, which consists of a rectangular DR coated with metal
on three sides and placed on a ground plane. The structure is ana-
lyzed by modelling the dielectric-air interface as perfect magnetic
conductor (PMC). A coplanar waveguide (CPW) with terminating
slots is used to feed the antenna. Measurement results exhibit a
wide bandwidth of about 47% over which the pattern on the
horizontal plane is nearly omnidirectional. The 10-dB bandwidth
of this broadband DR monopole covers 4.2–6.8 GHz. Hence, it can
be used for WLAN 802.11a applications.
Index Terms—Dielectric resonator (DR) antenna, monopole an-
tenna.
I. INTRODUCTION
THE prevalence of wireless communication demandsbroadband antennas which can be embedded within a
handset to provide versatile applications. Since it is difﬁcult
to obtain wide impedance bandwidth with single resonant
antenna, multiple antennas with different operating frequencies
have been integrated to satisfy the bandwidth requirement [1],
[2].
High-permittivity dielectric material has been used in mi-
crowave circuits such as ﬁlters or oscillators [3]. In order to fa-
cilitate the design of dielectric resonator, a heuristic approach
that models the dielectric-air interface as a perfect magnetic wall
was proposed to predict the resonant frequencies of cylindrical
resonators in 1965 [4]. Since 1983, dielectric resonators have
been designed as antenna elements by exciting different modes
of DR using conventional feeding mechanisms [5].
A DR antenna exhibits a broader bandwidth if its factor is
lower. In [6], a notched rectangular DR antenna with a low
factor is proposed. By lifting a DR above the ground plane, its
factor can be effectively reduced [7]. The bandwidth of DR
can also be increased by modifying its geometry. For example,
a truncated tetrahedral DR with its narrow base attached to the
ground reaches an impedance bandwidth of 40% [8]. A split
conical DR with split side attached to the ground can reach a
bandwidth of 50% [9].
High-permittivity material can be used to reduce the size of
DR at the expense of bandwidth reduction. However, DRs with

larger aspect ratio has been used to reduce the factor and
hence obtain a wider impedance bandwidth [10], [11].
Multiple DRs with close resonant frequencies can exhibit
broadband characteristics by coupling their resonant modes. For
example, two cylindrical DRs can be stacked to couple their
modes [1]. In [2], two rectangular DRs with different
sizes are placed at proximity, leaving a slot to couple their
modes.
The bandwidth of DR antenna can also be extended by at-
taching additional parasitic elements to incur another resonance.
In [12], two metal strips are attached to the top of a DR to incur
additional resonance close to that of the DR. The inductance
of the metal strip and the capacitance between the strip and the
ground plane form an LC tank which can be coupled to the DR
resonant mode to exhibit a wider bandwidth.
The impedance bandwidth of DR antennas can be further in-
creased by modifying their feeding structures. In [13], a cou-
pling slot is proposed to excite the DR. The resonant modes of
slot and DR are coupled to increase the antenna bandwidth.
In [14], a patch resonant mode and a dielectric resonant mode
are coupled to increase the DR antenna bandwidth. The signal is
fed from the microstrip feed line, through the slot on the ground
plane and the slot on the patch, to the DR. In [15], a DR is
attached to a circular slot and an eccentric ring slot to achieve
a broad bandwidth. A grounded metal plate placed in a plane
of symmetry of the electric ﬁeld distribution can reduce the DR
size by half without perturbing the original ﬁeld distribution.
In [16], a rectangular DR integrated with an inverted L-plate
antenna is proposed. The DR not only serves as a radiator but
also serves as a feeding element for the L-plate.
Typical bandwidth of a rectangular DR antenna is about
6–10%, which can be increased to more than 10% by using
lower-permittivity dielectric at the cost of increasing the DR
size. Stacking DRs of different sizes or using parasitic DRs
can further increase the impedance bandwidth to more than
20% [1], [2]. The former incurs a higher antenna proﬁle, while
the latter occupies larger space. Stacking DRs of different
permittivities can achieve well coupling to microstrip line
and a wider bandwidth of 40% simultaneously. However, the
antenna complexity increases. Conical or truncated conical DR
can provide more than 50% of impedance bandwidth, but the
radiation pattern varies over the band due to the presence of
higher-order modes [9].
In this work, a broadband dielectric resonator antenna with
a nearly-omnidirectional radiation pattern is proposed. The di-
electric resonator is partially coated with metal on its surface,
which can be modeled as a cavity having perfect electric con-
ductor (PEC) and perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) walls on

the resonant frequencies of the monopole and the fundamental
mode of DR can be moved close to each other. By changing the
lengths of the terminating slots and the offset between the DR
and the terminating slots , good impedance matching can be

pling the resonant bands of the monopole and the fundamental
mode of DR with metal coating. Fig. 5 shows the return loss
of the DR-monopole antenna, the measurement and the simula-
tion results match reasonably well at the band edges. The 10-dB
bandwidth is about 47.3% (4.2–6.8 GHz), which is wide enough
to cover the IEEE 802.11a applications. Two nulls occurs at 4.56
GHz and 6.32 GHz, which are close to the resonant frequencies
of the monopole and the fundamental mode of DR, respectively.
Fig. 6 shows the radiation patterns generated by the
DR-monopole with coating on three sides and ﬁve sides,

mode, the DR-monopole with three-side coating has a more
omnidirectional pattern on the -plane than that with
ﬁve-side coating. The component with three-side coating
is lower than that with ﬁve-side coating at . For
frequency associated with the fundamental mode of DR, the
DR-monopole with three-side coating also has a more omnidi-
rectional pattern on the -plane that with ﬁve-side coating.
Hence, the DR with three-side coating is preferred.

Dualband Split Dielectric Resonator Antenna
Tze-Hsuan Chang, Student Member, IEEE, and Jean-Fu Kiang, Member, IEEE
Abstract—A dualband dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is
designed by splitting a rectilinear dielectric resonator (DR) and
carving notches off the DR. It is observed that notches engraved
at different positions affect different modes. Removal of dielectric
material from where the electric ﬁeld is strong incurs a signiﬁcant
increase in resonant frequency. The abrupt change of normal
electric ﬁeld across the discontinuities reduces the -factor and
increases the impedance bandwidth. Both the  
   
and  
  
modes incur broadside radiation patterns on the -plane. The
proposed DRA can cover both the worldwide interoperability for
microwave access (WiMAX, 3.4–3.7-GHz) and the wireless local
area network (WLAN, 5.15–5.35-GHz) bands.
Index Terms—Dielectric resonator (DR).
I. INTRODUCTION
DIELECTRIC resonators made of low-loss and high-per-mittivity material have been used to implement antennas
[1]. They have higher radiation efﬁciency than printed antennas
at higher frequency due to the absence of ohmic loss and surface
wave, in addition to compact size, light weight, and low cost.
Many efforts have been devoted to developing multiband or
wideband dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) [2]–[15]. For
example, make the feeding aperture radiate like a slot antenna
to incur another band [2]–[4] and induce parasitic effects with
attached metal strips [5]–[7].
In [8], speciﬁc higher order modes with the electric ﬁeld dis-
tribution on the top surface of the dielectric resonator (DR) sim-
ilar to that of the fundamental mode are intentionally excited. In
[9] and [10], higher order modes of truncated conical or tetra-
hedral DR are excited to obtain wide impedance bandwidth.
DRs of different sizes have been placed vertically to form
a stacked DRA, or at close proximity, to form a multielement
DRA to attain wideband or dualband features [12]–[15].
In this paper, a dualband DR antenna is proposed by split-
ting a rectilinear DR evenly. The electric ﬁeld over the gap in
between is signiﬁcantly enhanced, hence reducing the -factor.
Two notches are also engraved in each piece to tune the reso-
nant frequencies and increase the impedance bandwidth as well.
The effect of the gap and notches on the resonant frequencies
are carefully studied and the resonant bands associated with the
and modes can be adjusted to cover theworldwide
interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX, 3.4–3.7-GHz)
and the wireless local area network (WLAN, 5.15–5.35-GHz)
bands.

II. ANTENNA CONFIGURATION
Fig. 1 shows the conﬁguration of the DRA, which is com-
posed of two identical rectangular DRs of dimension ,
separated by a gap . Each DR is engraved with two notches
at its bottom and side edge, with dimensions and
, respectively. The DRs are placed on a ground plane
of size on an FR4 substrate of thickness and permit-
tivity 4.4. A microstrip line is used to feed the DRs through an
aperture of size . The microstrip line is extended over
the aperture by . The offset between the aperture and the DR
is .
The resonant frequency is mainly determined by the DR
dimensions and permittivity . The carved notches
change the electric ﬁeld distribution in the original DRs, hence
the resonant frequencies. Since the gap is perpendicular to the
electric ﬁeld of the mode of the otherwise intact DR,
the electric ﬁeld is enhanced within the gap. Thus, the resonant
frequency of the mode and the input impedance are
signiﬁcantly affected. The input impedance can be ﬁne tuned
by adjusting the DR offset , the length of the extended
microstrip line, and the aperture length .

A. Field Enhancement by a Gap
Fig. 4(a) shows two rectangular DRs placed on a ground
plane, separated by a gap at . At component
of the and modes reaches the maximum while
that of the mode vanishes. The gap is much smaller
than and the resonant modes associated with the single DR
formed by ﬁlling the gap between the aforementioned two DRs
are excited. The air-dielectric interface of the gap is normal to
, hence the component is signiﬁcantly enhanced to satisfy
the continuity condition on .
Fig. 5 shows the effect of gap width on the return loss.
It is observed that the resonant frequency of the mode
increases signiﬁcantly, while those of the and
modes are slightly affected. Note that the band associated with
the mode merges with that of the mode.
By image theory, the structure in Fig. 4(a) is equivalent to
that in Fig. 4(b) if the ground plane is of inﬁnite extent. The two
DRswith a separating gap can be regarded as an inhomogeneous
DR with permittivity . The gap width is assumed much
smaller than , hence the ﬁeld distribution inside the single in-
homogeneous DR is almost the same as that without the gap,
except the normal electric ﬁeld inside the gap is enhanced to
satisfy the air-dielectric continuity condition. Thus, the ﬁelds of

Note that the component is enhanced by a factor . For
the mode, approaches as the gap width is very
small. For the mode, it is observed that the component
is only slightly enhanced, incurring a small of about 2 to 3.
Hence, the resonant frequency of the mode is slightly
increased. In contrast, the ﬁelds of the modes in the air
gap are approximately

pattern in front of the wall ( -direction).
VI. CONCLUSION
A dualband DRA is proposed, which is composed of two
notched DRs separated by a narrow air gap. The effects of
gap and notches on the resonant frequency shift are carefully
studied. Two bands are attained in 3.375–3.93 GHz (15%)
and 5.08–5.415 GHz (6%) with broadside pattern on the
-plane; the third band in 4.6–4.79 GHz (4%) is not practical.
The proposed DRA can be used in the WiMAX (3.4–3.7 GHz)
and WLAN (5.15–5.35 GHz) bands.

DC Power Consumption
Ping-Yuan Deng, Student Member, IEEE and Jean-Fu Kiang, Member, IEEE
Abstract— A K-band low-noise amplifier (LNA) is designed and
fabricated in a standard 0.18 µm CMOS technology. A design
method of CMOS LNA is used to render the optimum source
resistance (Ropt) close to 50 Ω and Zin = Z∗opt by using small
devices and small bias currents. This LNA chip achieves a peak
gain of 13.5 dB and a noise figure of 4.7 dB at 24 GHz. The supply
voltage and supply current are 1 V and 8.3 mA, respectively. The
input and output return loss are lower than −10 dB. The input
referred 1-dB compression (P1dB) is −7 dBm. The chip size is
0.64 mm × 0.48 mm.

I. INTRODUCTION
AT frequencies above 20 GHz, GaAs-based HEMT andHBT processes dominate most of the applications in the
past. With the rapid advance of CMOS technologies, it is
becoming plausible to implement RF systems operating at 20
GHz and higher using CMOS technologies. RF and baseband
circuits realized in CMOS are expected to reduce the cost
of systems such as FMCW (24 GHz ISM band) [2], ultra-
wideband (UWB, 22-29 GHz) short-range radars [3], and local
multipoint distribution systems (LMDS). Low-noise amplifier
is a key module for any RF system. CMOS LNAs have been
designed for frequencies above 20 GHz [4]-[6]. LNAs with
low noise figures (NFs) are usually achieved at the expense of
high dc power consumption.
In this paper, we present a design method of CMOS low-
noise amplifiers to achieve simultaneous noise matching and
power matching by tailoring the device size. It is found
that Ropt close to 50 Ω and Zin = Z∗opt can be obtained
by using small devices and small currents. This design also
achieves acceptable power gain, low noise figure and low
power consumption. Circuit design considerations of LNA will
be presented in Section II. Simulation and measurement results
will be discussed in Section III, followed by the conclusions.
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN
A. General Considerations
Fig. 1 shows the two-port network of a microwave amplifier.
The transducer power gain GT and available power gain GA
can be derived as [1]

|1− S11ΓS |2

1− |Γout|2
Fig. 1. Two-port network of a microwave amplifier.
(a) (b)
Fig. 2. LNA topology, (a) common-source amplifier, (b) cascode amplifier.
The transducer gain GT is affected by the input and output
matching networks. In the LNA design, the input matching
network transforms Z1 to Zopt (ΓS = Γopt) to achieve min-
imum noise figure NFmin. If the load reflection coefficient
ΓL is adjusted to transfer maximum power to the load (ΓL =
Γ∗out), then GT = GA. In practice, input matching in the LNA
design usually involves trade-offs among power gain, noise
figure, and VSWRs .
Many LNA topologies have been proposed in the literatures
[5], [7]. The most frequently used LNA topology is the
common-source (CS) and cascode configurations as shown
in Fig. 2. The CS-stage can exhibit minimum noise figure
with a proper input matching, and it can work at low supply
voltage below 1 V. The cascode amplifier has higher power
gain and reduced Miller effect, but it can not work at low
supply voltage. Compared to a common-source amplifier, the
cascode amplifier has a poorer noise performance especially
when the operation frequency is close to fT. Hence, the CS-
stage is chosen in this work.
B. Noise Matching with Power Matching
Fig. 3 (a) shows a common-source amplifier with source
inductor Ls1 as a feedback. Fig. 3 (b) shows the small-
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES 3
Fig. 6. Schematic of K-band LNA.
Fig. 5 (a) shows the proposed schematic of source inductor
feedback amplifier with shunt inductor and series capacitor for
input impedance matching. Proper device size of M1 is chosen
to tune the source impedance into ZS = Zopt = Ropt+ jX =
50+jX. At conjugate matching (Zin = Z∗opt) as shown in Fig.
5 (b), a shunt inductor Lg1 will change the negative reactance
to a positive reactance jX on the same constant-conductance
circle on the Smith chart, the series capacitance C1 is then
used to resonate with jX. The combination of Lg1 and C1
transfers RS to Zopt, Lg1 and C1 also act as part of the bias
network and dc block, respectively.
By using this approach, the required value of Lg1 is about
0.2∼0.3 nH, which can be practically implemented in Si-based
technology at frequency above 20 GHz. A bypass capacitor
Cb is added to stabilize the supply voltage Vg1 and to isolate
the noise to it. Thus, no additional bias networks such as
large shunt resistors and large dc-block capacitors are required,
which leads to a smaller chip size and lower noise figure.
D. Design of 24 GHz LNA
Since a single transistor does not generate enough gain
at high frequencies, the three-stage cascaded common-source
structure is proposed as shown in Fig. 6. In the first stage,
proper choice of gm1 and Cgs1 of M1 and Ls1 are used to shift
the input impedance for noise matching. In order to reduce the
power consumption, the device size of M1 should be as samll
as possible to reduce the bias current. In this work, M1 is
designed to have 11 fingers with the total gate width of 33
µm, and is biased at 1 V with drain current of 3 mA. Under
these conditions, the input impedance Zin is conjugate to Zopt.
Thus, minimum noise figure, high power gain, low bias current
and good input impedance matching (VSWR'1) are achieved
simultaneously.
The shunt inductor Lg1 and series capacitor C1 are used to
conjugate match the input impedance. Higher gain of the first
stage will suppress the noise contribution of the subsequent
stage, leading to a better noise performance. In this work, we
choose Lg1 = 0.28 nH and C1 = 112.3 fF.
Common-source amplifiers with inductive degeneration are
used as the second and the third stages to increase the overall

dBm. The gate biases Vg1, Vg2 and Vg3 are tuned to 0.7, 0.75,
and 0.8 V, respectively, to increase linearity.
As can be observed, the measured S11 differs from the
simulated S11 by a few dB, and the measured S21 is also
lower than the simulated S21 by a few dB. By careful review of
the layout, we suspect that the parasitic effects contributed by
the silicon substrate under the transmission lines are the cause.
Retrying the substrate parameters such as tanδ and permittivity
in the EM simulator, we build equivalent lumped circuits
for these transmission lines. As a result, several capacitors
are added between the transmission lines and the ground as
shown in Fig. 6. After adding these parasitic capacitances, the
simulated results fit more closely to the measured results. Part
of the deviation between simulation and measurement may be
due to the inaccurate active device model which is deducted

and comparison with the literatures are listed in Table I.

is proposed to render Ropt close to 50 Ω and Zin = Z∗opt

Dual-band VCO with Switched Inductors for UWB
Applications
Wei-Yang Lee, Student Member, IEEE and Jean-Fu Kiang, Member, IEEE
Abstract— A dual-band VCO is designed in a 0.18 µm CMOS
process by applying the switched-inductor approach on a single
PMOS cross-coupled pair VCO to enable its operation in 3,960
and 7,128 MHz bands. The VCO operates on an 1 V power
supply, its phase noise at 1 MHz offset is −113.8 dBc/Hz at
3,960 MHz and −110.2 dBc/Hz at 7,128 MHz. The core VCO
consumes 8.95 mW at both bands.
Index Terms— CMOSFETs, phase noise, switched circuit,
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).
I. INTRODUCTION
The 3.1-10.6 GHz frequency band has been allocated by
the Federal Communications Committee (FCC) for the ultra-
wideband (UWB) system to enable a high data-rate transmis-
sion over the air [15]. Fig.1 shows the frequency allocation of
the multi-band orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (MB
OFDM) approach. There are 14 bands organized into five
groups, with each band covering 528 MHz. The first four
groups contain three bands each, and the last group contains
two bands. The operation within the first group is mandatory,
and all the other groups are optional. Note that the 5-6 GHz
band has also been allocated for wireless local area network
(WLAN).
The voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are key compo-
nents of an UWB system. VCOs are widely used as CW
signal generator in a phase-locked loop (PLL) based frequency
synthesizer. Though multiple VCOs can be used to generate
signals in multiple frequency bands, using a single multiband
VCO is desirable to reduce chip area and cost [1].
In designing a VCO, there is usually a trade-off between
phase noise and dc power consumption. Other factors include
the center frequency of oscillation, tuning range and output
power level.
By employing a PMOS cross-coupled pair with a capacitive
feedback, a significant improvement in phase noise and output
swing can be achieved [2]. In [3], a balanced Hartley VCO
is presented, and a pi-network is implemented to provide
the required 180◦phase shift for the feedback signal. In [4],
a Hartley differential CMOS VCO with a large-resistance
element is applied to supress the even mode. In [5], a 90 GHz
VCO is designed with the ring-coupled quad, and is fabricated
in a 90 nm CMOS process. This ring-coupled quad takes four-
stage common-source transistors to create a higher open-loop
gain.
In [6] and [7], current-reuse structure like frequency multi-
plier is embedded in VCO to lower the power consumption. In
[8], a differential Colpitts oscillator is designed to have a high

gain while maintaining low phase noise due to its cyclostation-
ary noise properties. In [9], a varactor architecture is proposed
to the differential control line of a VCO to achieve large
CMRR. In [10], the NMOS cross-coupled pair is used with
the buffer composed of shunt inductors to increase the output
power. In [11], a 40 GHz wideband VCO is implemented
in a 0.18 µm CMOS technology, designed based on a non-
uniform standing-wave VCO with a switched transmission-line
architecture in order to achieve a wide tuning range. In [12],
a complementary cross-coupled differential structure is used
to achieve a higher transconductance. To avoid large process
variation of load resistors, PMOS transistors are used as the
loads of the buffer. In [13], a 3-D LC VCO incorporating
metal-6 on-chip inductors is implemented in a 0.18 µm 1P6M
CMOS technology to increase the Q factors and halve the die
area. In [14], switched-inductor technique is used to designed
a dual-band oscillator, but the usage of asymmetrical switched-
inductor raises the phase noise.
In this paper, a daul-band voltage-controlled oscillator is
proposed for the MB OFDM system. A symmetrical switched-
inductance instead of a switched capacitor is used to switch
the oscillator frequency. A switched inductor can replace more
switched capacitors to reduce the phase noise, since the latter
requires more MOS switches hence generates more phase
noise.
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN
Fig.2 shows the architecture of the frequency synthesizer
complying with MB OFDM. Two PLLs are used with the
common reference clock of 33 MHz. One PLL locks the main
VCO at 3,960 MHz or 7,128 MHz, and the other PLL locks
the slave VCO at 528 MHz. When the frequency of the main
VCO is 3,960 MHz, the single-sided band (SSB) mixer can
generate 3,432 MHz and 4,488 MHz signals which are the
other two bands in group 1. When the frequency of the main
VCO is 7,128 MHz, the single-sided band (SSB) mixer can
generate 6,600 MHz and 7,656 MHz signals in group 3. The

Rsub in series with Cdb will reduce the Q factor of the
capacitor. Fig.5(b) shows the circuit model of the switch at the
on state. In order to increase tunability, Cdb and Cgd should
be made smaller. However, when the transistor is designed
narrower, its finite on-resistance Ron will increase and boost
the tank loss.

Define the charging ratio as the ratio between the charged
voltage and the intended voltage. For example, if the intended
voltage at a pixel is 6 V and the pixel voltage reaches 5.5 V
at the end of the charging period, the charging ratio will be
5.5/6 = 0.917.
Based on the signal line model consisted of infinitesimal

line can be expressed as

where R and C are the per-unit-length resistance and capaci-

and v (z, t) is the voltage on the line at time t and at a distance
z from the source. To reach the charging ratio of 0.995, the
delay time will be T0.995 = 2.245RCz2.

Since the signal line can be viewed as a cascade of infinites-

as an equivalent RC circuit with an effective time constant
τα (z) which can be expressed in terms of Tα (z) as

Since no data of line resistance and capacitance are available
for a 60” LCD panel with full HD resolution, we assume
the per-unit-length resistance and capacitance of the 60” LCD
panel are the same as those of the 40” LCD panel. Table I lists
the parameters of a 40” TFT-LCD with full HD resolution. The
length of a scan line is ` = 1, 920× 151µ× 3 = 86.976 cm,
hence R = 5/0.86976 = 5.7487kΩ/m, C = 480/0.86976 =
551.876pF/m. The length of a data line is ` = 1, 080 ×

454µ = 49.032 cm, hence R = 18/0.49032 = 36.71kΩ/m,
C = 276/0.49032 = 562.897pF/m.
Figs.2(a) and 2(b) show the delay time Tα (z) and the effec-
tive time constants τα (z), respectively, at different charging
ratios. It is observed that τα (z) is insensitive to α, especially
when α is closed to unity. In practical applications, the value
of α is chosen to be greater than 0.995 to have high fidelity.
Thus, we may set τα (z) = τ (z).
The time allocated for displaying each row is

where αsync is the fraction of time reserved for horizontal
sync. When the data line is being charged, the transistors on
the designated row must be turned on by sending a pulse along
the associated scan line. The pixels will wait for td,scan before
the pulse arrives, where td,scan is the delay on scan line which
can be calculated using (2). Note that td,scan of the farthest
pixel from the scan driver must be shorter than Trow to have
enough margin. Since the loading effect of a single pixel on a
data line is negligible, the available charging time is Tcharge =
Trow.
The signal delay is longer for those subpixels which are
farther from the data driver, and is shorter for those which

charging, thus the data voltage is sent via SW0 to the data
line. In charging the pixels from rows 826 to 926, the data
voltage is sent via SW1, and the output voltage is determined
by resistance R1 and Rref as in (9), and so on.
Fig.6 shows the driver circuit with a frame buffer to charge
data lines. The data in the previous frame is stored in the
buffer to be compared with the data in the current frame to
calculate the voltage to be sent to the data lines.
Each time a rising edge of Vsync,hor arrives, the first stage of
latch layer 1 receives one subpixel data of the current frame,
and the first stage of latch layer 2 receives the subpixel data
of the previous frame from the frame buffer. When the next
Vsync,hor arrives, the second stage of latch layer 1 will receive
the first row of data of the current frame, and the second stage
of the latch layer 2 will receive the first row of data of the
previous frame. The data stored in these stages are then sent
to DAC 1 and DAC 2, respectively, to be transformed to the
voltage inputs for the operational amplifiers to determine the
output voltages for all the data lines.

In the standard HDTV, the frame rate is 60 Hz, thus the
frame period is 1/60 = 16.67 ms. With resolution 1, 920 ×

Fig.10 shows the relation between the panel size and the
number of segments required to reach α = 0.995. The
number of segments increases linearly with the panel size.
For example, the numbers of segments for 60”, 80”, and 160”
panels are 6, 20, and 105, respectively. For the large one like
160” panel, two data drivers may be considered to drive the
data line from opposite ends, and the total number of segments
can be reduced to about 40.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
An active charging method for large-size or high-resolution
LCD is proposed. In this method, the data between adjacent
frames are compared, different effective time constants at
different locations on a data line are considered to generate
the precise active charging voltage at the given charging ratio.
Compared to conventional method, this method can charge
large-size panel more precisely within the charging time.

III. CONSTRAINTS ON PIXEL DESIGN
As shown in Fig. 1, the voltage Ve at the display electrode
is a function of the data line voltage Vd as [5], [6]
Ve =
1− ae−t/τ
1− be−t/τ Vd
with
a =
Vd − Ve0
Vd
2 (Vs − Vt − Vd) + Vd
2 (Vs − Vt − Vd) + Vd − Ve0
b =
Vd − Ve0
2 (Vs − Vt − Vd) + Vd − Ve0
τ =
Cpx
β0 (Vs − Vt − Vd)
where Vs is the voltage on the scan line, Vt is the threshold
voltage of the TFT, Ve0 = Ve(t = 0), and β0 = µeffCgW/L
is a parameter determined by the TFT geometry and material
[4]. The channel width W and length L of the TFT are the
design parameters to be optimized.
A. Charging Phase
First express the rise-time tr in units of τ as tr = ktτ , and
define the voltage ratio rc = Ve/Vd, then kt can be expressed
as
kt = ln
a− brc
1− rc
The rise-time must be shorter than the period Trow allocated
for displaying one row of pixels, deducting the delay over the
scan line, namely,
tr < Trow − Tdelay
where Tdelay is the maximum allowable delay time over a scan
line. Thus, we obtain the first constraint
W
L
>
Cpx
µeffCg (Vs − Vt − Vd)
kt
(Trow − Tdelay) (3)
Note that the delay time along a sacn line depends on the TFT
parameters. Hence the maximum allowable delay time must be
estimated iteratively, incorporating the other constraints that
will be discussed later.
B. Holding Phase
In the holding phase, the charge leaks through the equivalent
RC circuit formed by RLC, Roff and Cpx, where Roff =
Ved/Ioff is the off-resistance of the TFT with Ved = Ve − Vd
[10]. The time constant of the pixel during the holding phase
is
τpx =
RLCRoff
RLC + Roff
Cpx (4)
The leakage current Ioff can be expressed as [10]
Ioff ' σDtsemiVedW
L
where σD and tsemi are the dark conductivity and thickness,
respectively, of the semicoductor layer.
Define the retention ratio in the holding phase as
r = e−Tframe/τpx
To display a distortion-free image, the voltage deviation due
to leakage must be less than one grey level, which leads to
r > 1− 1
2Nbit

where Nbit is the number of bits. Substituting (4) into (5), we
obtain the second constraint

Tframe2NbitσDtsemi
(6)
C. Asymmetric Kickback
At the end of the charging phase, the TFT is turned off and
the pixel is switched to the holding phase, the voltage at the
gate terminal of Cgd is pulled low, and the display electrode
at the other terminal of Cgd is pulled low, too. By imposing
the law of charge conservation and assuming the scan pulse
is a square pulse, a kickback voltage of magnitude [4]
∆Vkb = (vs,on − vs,off) Cgd + Cpg
Cgd + Cpg +CLC(V ) + CS
will appear at the display electrode of the pixel, where vs,on
and vs,off are the voltages on the scan line at the on and off
states, respectively, Cgd is the parasitic capacitatance between
the gate and the drain electrodes of TFT, and CLC(V ) is the
voltage across the pixel.
Define the deviation of ∆Vkb as
∆(∆Vkb) =
∆Vkb,max −∆Vkb,min
2
=
(vs,on − vs,off) (Cgd + Cpg)
2(Cgd + Cpg + CLC,min +CS)
CLC,max − CLC,min
Cgd +Cpg + CLC,max + CS
(7)
The average of ∆Vkb can be compensated by tuning the volt-
age level of the common electrode on the color-filter substrate,
but the voltage deviation ∆(∆Vkb) tends to induce a residual
direct current with a preferred polarity, which will degrade
the quality of the liquid crystal. Hence, ∆(∆Vkb) must be
constrained by an acceptable residual voltage threshold Fkb
as [9]
∆(∆Vkb) < Fkb (8)

The data-line delay td,data,FSC for the voltage to reach 90%

Since Nscan,FSC = Nscan,CF, we have Rdata,FSC ' Rdata,CF,
Cdata,FSC ' Cdata,CF, and td,data,FSC ' td,data,CF.
Since a scan line drives more pixels than a data line
does, td,scan > td,data, thus the delay time Tdelay during the
charging phase is dominated by the scan line delay, hence
Tdelay,FSC ' Tdelay,CF
namely, both FSC LCDs and CF LCDs have similar delay
time budget.
In summary, the major constraint on the FSC pixel design
is the short charging time. On the other hand, the FSC pixel
design is less restricted in the holding, asymmetric kickback,
and delay mechanisms. Since CLC,FSC = 3CLC,CF and Cpx '
CLC+CS , the storage capacitance required in the FSC LCDs
can be decreased. Since the storage capacitor and the TFT
are opaque, smaller h and W are preferred. A higher aperture
ratio can be realized in the FSC LCDs, which requires lower
backlight intensity and hence lower power consumption.
V. ASSESSMENT OF DIFFERENT SCREEN SIZES
In this section, the performances of a 30” WXGA and a
2.4” QVGA LSD will be analyzed. The FSC LCDs and the
CF LCDs will be compared in terms of operation window,
aperture ratio, and power consumption.
A. Operation Window
Fig. 2 shows the operation windows of 30” WXGA LCDs
based on the design constraints, where W is the TFT channel
width and h = ACS/Apixel is the ratio between the size of
the storage capacitor and that of the pixel. The operation
window of the FSC LCD has relatively low h and high W
compared with that of the CF LCD, with h30”,FSC > 0.121
and h30”,CF > 0.423.

10−4 m2/Vs and Vt = 0.7 V.
If the minimum channel widths, W30”,FSC = 157 µm at
h30”,FSC = 0.121 and W30”,CF = 34 µm at h30”,CF = 0.423,
respectively, are chosen, the maximum aperture ratios will be
AR30”,FSC = 79% and AR30”,CF = 45%. The available AR
at different channel widths and area ratios are marked in Fig.
3. The maximm AR of the FSC LCDs is about twice that of
the CF LCDs.
The performance parameters of two different LCD screen
sizes are summarized in Table I. The lower bound of W is
determined by the charging phase constraint for both screen
sizes, but the dominant factors for the upper bound of W
are different. For the large-size LCDs, the upper bound of
W is determined by the holding phase and the scan-line
delay constraints. For the small-size LCDs, the asymmetric
kickback constraint affects the operation window and can not
be neglected as shown in Fig. 4.
For 2.4” QVGA LCDs, the minimum TFT channel widths

Fig. 5 shows the capacitance ratio CS/Cpx as a function
of h, with dLC = 4.67 µm, tinsu = 0.3 µm, insu = 6.9, and
3.8 ≤ LC ≤ 11.7. Take WFSC = 284 µm, 0.128 < hFSC <
0.309 and WCF = 70 µm, 0.443 < hCF < 0.876, respectively,
as deduced from the operation windows shown in Fig. 2. Note
that 0.55≤ CS/Cpx ≤0.9 for the FSC LCDs, and 0.80≤
CS/Cpx ≤0.96 for the CF LCDs. Smaller CS/Cpx ratio
implies that smaller storage capacitance is needed to satisfy the
holding constraint. Because the storage capacitor is opaque,
larger CS/Cpx ratio implies smaller aperture ratio. Note that
ARFSC > ARCF and the ratio ARFSC,max/ARCF,max is
about 1.7.
The backlight consumes the most power in the LCDs.
Higher aperture ratio implies higher backlight efficiency or less
power consumption. In the FSC LCDs, the backlight efficiency
is three times that of the CF LCDs since no color filters are
used. If ARFSC,max/ARCF,max is about two, then the total
backlight power consumption of the FSC LCDs will be only
one sixth that the the CF LCDs. For example, if the 30” CF
LCDs require 130 W of backlight, then the 30” FSC LCDs will
require only 24 W to provide the same luminance. Similarly,
for 2.4” LCDs, if the CF LCDs require 500 mW of backlight,
the FSC ones will require only 90 mW.
C. Power Consumption
The power consumption of the data driver can be estimated
as [11]
P = VDD
NscanCdata∆Vd,max
2Trow
Ndata
where VDD is the power supply voltage, ∆Vd,max is the
maximum voltage swing on the data lines. Thus, the power
consumption ratio between the FSC LCDs and the CF LCDs
is close to one.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Design constraints on the FSC LCDs have been derived and
demonstrated with two different screen sizes. The FSC pixel
design is less constrained in the holding, asymmetric kickback
and delay mechanisms, but is more strictly constrained in
the charging phase. Higher aperture ratio and less power
consumption can be achieved for the FSC LCDs due to
the smaller storage capacitance needed. The line width and
channel width are critical in large-size LCDs, especially in
the FSC LCDs. Although the frame rate of the FSC LCDs is
three times that of the CF LCDs, the power consumption in
pixel related circuitries of the FSC LCDs is close to that of
the CF LCDs.

關於 UWB antenna的研究，目前大部分的 UWB天線大多屬於平面單極天線，差別只在
於輻射體形狀的改變，如圓形、橢圓形、環形、矩形等，也有較多的參數可以調整其頻寬。或
改變接地面的大小、形狀，來改善其輻射場型。以目前所發表的 UWB天線，其在低頻時的輻
射場型大多仍能維持全方向性；然而當頻率逐漸升高，在水平面的輻射場型大多會變形，而不
再是全方向性，因此適合應用在較短距離的傳輸。由於 UWB頻帶涵蓋 3-10 GHz，為了減少
與其他系統的互相干擾，某些研究在輻射金屬面上挖去部分金屬形成溝槽，產生一個止帶(band 
notch)，以防止干擾，而溝槽的形狀包含矩形、U型和雙 U型。其中在“Study of circular CPW-fed 
slot antenna with a resistive load＂中，在圓形的金屬天線上挖一矩形溝槽，並在溝槽中加一電
阻做為負載，可降低天線的共振頻率，並達到寬頻的效果。

Introduction
Many approaches have been proposed to broaden the impedance bandwidths of
monopoles. A common way is to replace the radiating wire with elements of diﬀer-
ent shapes to increase the radiating surface areas and impedance bandwidth [1], [2].
Since the current is concentrated on the outer edge of a planar monopole, the broad-
band characteristics are maintained when a hole is drilled oﬀ a planar monopole to
form an annular strip [3]. Moreover, resonant elements can be embedded within
annular planar monopoles to provide band-notched characteristics [4].
Printed monopoles with diﬀerent shapes have been proposed proposed to provide
broadband width [5], [6], dual-band [6], [7], and band-notched characteristic [8].
Printed monopoles can have a wider impedance bandwidth than wire monopole.
However, the radiation pattern is deteriorated at higher frequency.
In this work, a compact monopole made of dielectric resonator (DR) is proposed.
The conduction current in the microstrip line is transformed to the displacement
current in the DR. The impedance bandwidth covers 5.745-14.94 GHz, over which
the Eθ pattern on the xy-plane is nearly omnidirectional.
1 Design and Implementation
Fig. 1 shows the conﬁguration of the DR-loaded planar monopole. A microstrip line
of width wm is extended over the ground plane by p and attached to a rectilinear
dielectric resonator. A strip extended from the microstrip line is bent vertically and
adhered on one side of the DR. The antenna is fabricated on an FR4 substrate of
size Wg × Lg and thichness t.
