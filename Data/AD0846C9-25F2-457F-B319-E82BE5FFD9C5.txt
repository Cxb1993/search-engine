ABSTRACT  
 
The paper presents a finite element procedure for the inelastic postbuckling analysis of steel trusses under 
mechanical and thermal loadings. First, the force-displacement relation in total form was derived. Then an 
element is formulated to simulate the inelastic nonlinear behavior of truss members under thermal 
loadings. The actions due to restraint against elongation and material softening are referred to as thermal 
loads and reduced member loads, respectively. To account for the material softening at elevated 
temperatures, the EC3 reduction factors are adopted. The trusses are assumed to be either under constant 
temperature but increasing loads, or under constant loads but rising temperature. The generalized 
displacement control (GDC) method is modified to solve for the postbuckling paths of the trusses. The 
results indicate that the critical load (or temperature) of a truss decreases drastically as the preheating (or 
preload) increases, and that a truss shows a breaking strength much smaller than the elastic critical load, if 
the effect of yielding is taken into account. From the design point, the overall capacity of an elastic truss 
can be well represented by the critical load-temperature curve.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
  High temperature can cause material degradation and thermal expansion on structures. For steel 
structures, each of the members will lose its stiffness and strength as a result of deterioration in material 
properties due to temperature rise. Previously, most approaches for dealing with the stiffness or strength 
reduction of structural members have been based on standard fire test results for protected or unprotected 
specimens. However, the standard fire test is generally costly and subject to physical restraints, such as the 
furnace characteristics, boundary conditions, and standard fire exposures. Therefore, it can hardly be 
employed to simulate the real behavior of structures in real fire conditions. Alternatively, a tremendous 
amount of research works have been conducted to develop suitable numerical methods for predicting the 
behavior of structures under fire conditions. 
  Most of the previous studies on the fire behavior of structures, e.g., those listed in Refs. [1-4], were 
based on the finite element method for its versatility in accommodating various geometric, material and 
fire conditions. The behavior of steel structures is very complicated when on fire. The geometrical 
nonlinearity caused by large deformations, material nonlinearity caused by softening, and the effect of 
thermal straining on the calculation of member forces should all be taken into account in analysis. In a fire 
analysis, we are also interested in the mechanism of failure or progressive collapse of structures under 
thermal loadings. To this end, one fundamental problem is to analyze the limit-point or postbuckling 
behavior of a preloaded structure under rising temperature, or a preheated structure under increasing loads.  
  However, the load-deflection curves obtained by most previous numerical studies on thermally 
loaded structures rarely went beyond the limit point. This can be attributed partly to the lack of a proper 
procedure for dealing with the numerical instability around the limit point, and partly to the lack of 
knowledge of the structural behavior beyond the limit point. The objective of this paper is to fill in such a 
gap. As a first attempt to trace the postbuckling behavior of structures under thermal loadings, we shall 
concentrate only on the nonlinear behavior of trusses, for which the elastic postbuckling behavior is well 
rise. Throughout the process of deformation from C0 to C2, the cross-sectional area of each member of the 
truss is assumed to remain unchanged, i.e., 2 1 0A A A A= = =

9. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
 In this paper, a finite element procedure is presented for the inelastic postbuckling analysis of trusses 
under thermal loads. The force-displacement relation including the thermal effect in total form was 
derived. Then, it was shown that two kinds of actions can be induced on a truss member due to 
temperature rise, i.e., the thermal loads due to restraint against thermal expansion and the reduced member 
loads due to restraint against material softening. In the present analysis, a two-stage approach is adopted 
for application of the thermal loads. In the lock stage, the two ends of each member are restrained and the 
temperature is allowed to increase. Thus, fixed-end forces are developed at the two ends. In the unlock 
stage, the restraints  in magnitude but 
opposite to the reactions developed in the lock stage. , the generalized displacement control (GDC) 
fness parameter (GSP), was modified for tracing the postbuckling 
ath of trusses subjected either to temperature rise or load increments at a time. Two models of materials

method, enhanced with the general stif

are considered for the trusses, i.e., elastic and elastoplastic, based on EC3 rule for steel.  
The following conclusions can be drawn from the numerical studies conducted in this paper: (1) The 
solutions obtained by the present incremental-iterative approach have been demonstrated to agree well 
with both the analytical solutions or other solutions for the two-member truss. (2) The present approach, 
based on the GDC method, enables us to pass the limit points and trace the postbuckling path of the truss, 
which is beyond the capability of some commercial programs. (3) The critical load of a truss decreases 
drastically as the level of preheating increases. (4) The critical temperature of a truss decreases as the level 
of preloading on the truss increases. (5) If the effect of yielding is taken into account, the truss shows a 
breaking strength much lower than the elastic truss. This indicates the need to consider the effect of 
yielding in the fire analysis of trusses. (6) The critical load-temperature curve established for the truss 
represents the combined capacity of a truss in resisting the mechanical and thermal loads, which is useful 
for the purpose of design.
