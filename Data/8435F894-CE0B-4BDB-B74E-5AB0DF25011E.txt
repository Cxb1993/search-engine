Regarding to SoP system, the high k materials are extensively investigated for the 
applications in the monolithic microwave integrated circuit decoupling capacitors, and 
phased array antennas. BaxSr1-xTiO3 is widely used for the high charge storage density, 
the low leakage current, high breakdown field, high time-dependent dielectric 
breakdown (TDDB), and low fatigue and aging [6-10].  However, the voltage stability 
of the BST films becomes a major concern, and so the quadratic voltage coefficient of 
capacitance (VCC) is a critical factor for the analog/mixed-signal IC [11-16]. Besides, 
the dielectric constant of BST varies with the operating temperature [6-8], which affects 
the thermal stability of the capacitors [17-19].  
    Our work [9, 10] shows that parallel plate capacitors with BST/Cr(2nm)/BST 
dielectric exhibit lower leakage current and are more temperature stable than those with 
BST monolayer do. Besides, the formation of TiO2 phase was found in the annealed 
specimens with Cr interlayer. In this study, the effects of Cr thickness on the 
temperature and voltage stability of the dielectric behaviors of Pt/BST/Cr/BST/Pt 
capacitors are investigated.      
 
Experimental Procedures 
Specimens of Pt/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Cr/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3/Pt structure were employed. The 
starting p-type Si (100) wafers were cleaned by the standard RCA cleaning process. 
After cleaning, a 100-nm SiO2 films were grown on the Si substrate by the 
dry-oxidation in 1000 oC for 30 minutes. A 10-nm Ti films were sputtered onto the SiO2 
layer in the DC sputtering system, while a DC voltage is applied across the two 
electrodes to create a plasma. The bottom electrodes, 100-nm thick Pt films, were dc 
sputtered at room temperature. The first Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 (BST) films were then deposited 
using an RF magnetron sputtering at a substrate temperature of 350 oC for two hours, 
while RF voltages can be coupled capacitively through the insulating target to create a 
plasma. The sputtering chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 1×10-5 torr. Then, 
BST films were deposited at a constant pressure of 5×10-3 torr which was maintained by 
a mixture of argon and oxygen at 9 sccm and 3 sccm, respectively. The RF power for 
the deposition of both the first and second BST layers was 120 W (power density was 
2.7 W/cm2) for two hours, and the total thickness of BST films was about 300 nm 
(deposition rate: ~1.25 nm/min). Chromium films with various thicknesses (2 nm, 5 nm, 
10 nm, and 15 nm) were deposited after the deposition of the first BST films with the 
same sputtering system at a DC power of 100 W. The thickness of Cr films was 
monitored with a quartz crystal and a controller. The second BST layers were then 
deposited. The BST/Cr/BST/Pt specimens were annealed at 800 oC in O2 atmosphere 
for one hour and then were bombarded by O2 plasma for 10 minutes before deposition 
of the top Pt electrode.  
A dual beam (focused ion beam and electron beam) system (Nova 200, FEI 
company, Japan) was employed to observe the surface morphology of the films. An

decreases as tCr increases. Comparing with mono BST capacitor (DF~0.028), the 
dissipation factor (DF) decreases to 0.023 for specimens with 2-nm Cr layer, although 
the dielectric constant decreases from 456 to 371 with the implementation of 2-nm Cr 
interlayer. A preferred (100) orientation of BST suggests higher dielectric constant, and 
films with Cr show preferred (100) orientation as discussed previously. The dielectric 
constants of BST/Cr/BST dielectric are smaller than that of BST. Formation of TiO2 is 
the root cause for the decrease of k. The TiO2 dielectric is in serial with the BST 
dielectric. The dielectric constants of TiO2 and BST are about 15-35 [18] and 456, 
respectively.

Specimens with mono BST layer annealed at 800 °C in O2 atmosphere for one hour 
exhibit the uniform microstructure with an average grain size of about 100 nm, as 
shown in Fig. 3(a). Heterogeneous microstructures with the aggregates as indicated by 
arrows shown in Figs. 3(b)-(d) are observed for BST/Cr/BST with Cr thicknesses 
ranging from 2 nm to 10 nm. Nevertheless, the microstructure of BST/Cr(15nm)/BST 
exhibits a homogeneous surface morphology as shown in Fig. 3(e). Auger analysis 
results, shown in Fig. 3(f), suggest that only Ti and O are present in both the aggregates 
(A) and the film surfaces (F). Figures 3(g)-(k) give the AFM surface morphology and 
root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of specimens with various Cr thicknesses. 
The RMS surface roughness of mono BST film is 4.937 nm and the inserted Cr layer 
decreases the surface roughness, as shown in Fig. 5(f). The RMS values are 2.685 nm 
(tCr = 2 nm), 3.798 nm (tCr = 5 nm), 4.261 nm (tCr = 10 nm), and 4.318 nm (tCr = 15 nm). 
As indicated in Fig. 5(l), the RMS surface roughness decreases and then increases as tCr 
increases..

perovskite BST phase. The SAED spots, instead of rings, are observed in Fig. 4(b) 
because the electron-beam was focused on the BST grain. However, the formation of 
TiO2 is not clear now, and further studies are in progress. The created new compounds 
of BST films are possible. According to our XPS data, the shift of Ti binding energy is 
not obvious. On the other hand, Cr+3 (0.130 nm) is difficult to replace Ti+4 (0.145 nm) in 
the pervoskite structure.

where C is the measured capacitance, A is the electrode area, kTiO2 (tTiO2) and kBST (tBST) 
are the dielectric constant (thickness) of TiO2 and BST, respectively.  
Fig. 6 gives the calculated TiO2 thickness as a function of tCr with kTiO2=15 and 35. 
The calculated tTiO2 ranges from 13 to 30 nm for BST/Cr(15nm)/BST, which is 
consistent with HRTEM image in Fig. 5(a) where the TiO2 thickness is estimated to 
about 22 nm.

of the Schottky emission (SE) or Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission mechanism* of 
Pt/BST/Cr/BST/Pt capacitor with various Cr thicknesses (tCr) are listed in Table 1. In 
general, the activation energies are typical for the oxygen vacancies and oxygen 
vacancy related defects. Some defects could trap the charges to reduce the leakage 
current, but the thermal excitation of the trapped charge from one site to the other 
dominates transport in the films at higher temperature. However, more oxygen 
vacancies and oxygen vacancy related defects in BST/Cr(2nm)/BST and

Conclusions 
In this work, we use MIS capacitor as the adjust capacitor to control VCO’s 
oscillation frequency. Because the dielectric constant of HfO2 is larger than that of SiO2, 
the capacitance of Al/HfO2/Si capacitor will be larger than that of MOS capacitor with 
the same thickness and area. Therefore, there will be larger unit voltage for adjusting the 
the capacitance values of the capacitors. The Al/HfO2/Si capacitors are then 
implemented as the varactor in the VCO circuit, which show the slight tunability and 
lower power consumption compared to one of the VCO (BB125).   
In this study, parallel plate capacitors with BST/Cr/BST multilayer dielectric are 
also investigated. The insertion of the 2 nm Cr reduces the surface roughness and 
dissipation factor of the dielectrics. SEM and AFM are employed to investigate the 
microstructure of the BST/Cr/BST dielectrics, and the heterogeneous microstructures 
with the aggregates are found. The TiO2 layers are formed on the upper BST layer as 
suggested by X-ray diffraction patterns, TEM cross-section photograph, and AES 
analyses.
