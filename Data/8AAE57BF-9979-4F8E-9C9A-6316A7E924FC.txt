hyperoxia and hypercapnia can hence be used to reflect vessel capability to delivery 
oxygen and to dilate in response to vasoactive agent, which gives the indices of vessel 
functionality (VF) and maturation (VD) respectively.  
 In present study, we employed VD and VF technique in the evaluation of 
vascular remodeling post-stroke. Comparison has been made between these functional 
parameters and conventional structural index determined by steady-state contrast 
enhanced (SSCE) method.   
 
Material and Methods 
 
MRI protocol 
All imaging was performed on a 7.0-T Magnetic Resonance scanner (Bruker Biospec, 
Germany) equipped with an active shielding gradient (20 G/cm in 80 μs). Images 
were acquired using a 72-mm birdcage transmitter coil and a separate quadrature 
surface coil for signal detection. Gradient echo images were acquired during 
inhalation of air, air-CO2 (95% air 5% CO2) and O2-CO2 (95% oxygen 5% CO2; 
carbogen) with 2D Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) sequence with the following 
imaging parameters: repetition time (TR) = 200 ms , echo time (TE) = 25 ms, flip 
angle (FA) = 15°, sampling bandwidth (BW) = 25 kHz, average (NEX) = 4, 
acquisition matrix = 256×256, field of view (FOV) = 2.56cm×2.56cm, slice thickness 
= 0.7mm, number of repetition = 14 and total acquisition time = 48 minutes. For 
SSCE experiment, T2- and T2*-weighted MR images were obtained in the same 
location with an FOV of 2.56cm_2.56 cm, matrix size of 256_128 (zero filled to 
256_256), and 1-mm-thick slice. T2-weighted MRI was acquired using the RARE 
sequence with a TR= 4000 ms, a pseudo-echo time of 70 ms, echo-train length of 8, 
and NEX= 12. T2*-weighted MRI was performed using the FLASH sequence with a 
TR= 300 ms, TE = 13 ms, flip angle of 151, and NEX= 16. T2-weighted spin echo 
and T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences, respectively, were performed before 
and after an injection of iron oxide (Feridex IV, Berlex Laboratories, Wayne, NJ, USA) 
at a dose of 30mg Fe/kg. 
 
Animal model 
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighting 300-350g were used in this study. Each rat was 
initially anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in air with rate of 1L /min and orally

following equation: 
VD = ln(Sair-CO2/Sair)/TE 
where Iair is the mean signal intensity during inhalation of air. Higher VD corresponds 
to increased signal intensity by hypercapnia due to vasodilation regulated by pericytes 
and smooth muscle cells. Transverse relaxation rate changes were given by ΔRR2 = 
ln(Spre/Spost)/TE. CBV is proportional to the calculated ΔR2R . 
 
Results 
 
Figure 1 shows the VD and VF responses in normal SD rat. Figure 1a is the 
gradient echo image acquired during air inhalation. Marked hypointensity due to 
susceptibility effect of deoxyhemoglobin was noted at large veins and intracortical 
venules. With the inhalation of air and 5% CO2 (Figure 1b), this susceptibility effect 
diminishes mildly, probably due to the vasodilation effect which drains more fresh 
blood to the veins and increases venous oxygen saturation. Images acquired during 
inhalation of 95% oxygen and 5% CO2 shows significantly lesser susceptibility effect 
due to increased partial pressure of oxygen in plasma. Figure 1c represents the VD 
mapping. Area of high VD value corresponds to the venous structure in figure 1a. 
Figure 1d is the VF mapping which shows general increase in BOLD signal in brain 
tissue. 
Figure 2 shows the comparison of VD with conventional SSCE-MRI CBV 
measurement in MCAO model. Figure 2a and 2c are images acquired during air and 
air-CO2 inhalation respectively. Figure 2c represents the VD mapping in response to 
hypercapnia. Figure 2d and 2e are pre-contrast and post-contrast gradient echo images 
respectively. CBV mapping (Figure 2f) correlates well to the VD response in figure 
2c.

seen in large draining veins which could be several voxels away from the affected 
tissue capillary bed. Furthermore, the venous signal changes represent a combination 
of physiological alternations of the several arterioles draining into it. This indicates 
that subtle alternation could be masked by neighbor tissue. Inflow CBV measurement 
using inflow vascular-space occupancy (iVASO)[7] technique holds great promises to 
solve the addressed issues.

The goal of this research is to utilize non-invasive MRI technique, namely VD and 
VF, in the study of vascular functionality and maturation. We first explored the 
feasibility of applying this technique in the study of vascular remodeling process in 
stroke recovery. The next step would involve the use of this technique in other disease 
model such as neoplasia and Huntington disease. This study ushers in a new epoch 
where vascular functional information such as VD and VF can be assessed 
non-invasively by MRI. We expect to publish our findings in SCI journals when the 
study is completed.
