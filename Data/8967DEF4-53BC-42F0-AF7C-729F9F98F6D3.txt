Abstract:  The ∞H  control problem for 
neutral system with time-varying delays is 
considered.  Delay-dependent criteria are 
proposed to guarantee the stabilization and 
disturbance attenuation of systems.  Linear 
matrix inequality (LMI) optimization approach 
is used to solve the ∞H  control problem.   
∞H  control for unperturbed neutral system is 
investigated in the first.  Then ∞H  control 
for uncertain neutral system is derived directly 
from the unperturbed case.  Static output and 
observer-based controls are also studied in this 
project.

1.  Introduction 
 The phenomena of time delay are often 
encountered in many practical systems, such as 
chemical engineering systems, inferred 
grinding model, manual control, neural 
network, nuclear reactor, population dynamic 
model, and ship stabilization [1-2].  In many 
systems, the models of systems are described 
by functional differential equations of neutral 
type which depend on the delays of state and 
state derivative.  Physical examples for 
neutral time-delay systems have chemical 
reactors, distributed networks, dynamic 
process including steam and water pipes, 
microwave oscillators, systems of a turbojet 
engine, lossless transmission lines, and so on 
[3-7].  On the other hand, time delay often 
causes instability and generation of oscillation.  
Hence many stabilization approaches have 
been proposed to deal the problem of 
specification requirements of neutral systems 
[8-12].  ∞H  control is proposed to reduce the 
effect of the disturbance input on the regulated 
output to within a prescribed level [8-9, 11].  
Positive real control is proposed to guarantee 
that the resulting closed-loop system is stable 
and its transfer function is positive real [10].  
Guaranteed cost control is proposed to 
stabilize the system and provides an upper 
bound on the performance index [12].  
Depending on whether the criterion itself 
contains the sizes of time delays, criteria for 
time-delay systems can be classified into two 
categories, namely delay-independent criteria 
[10-12] and delay-dependent criteria [8-9].  
Generally speaking, the latter ones are less

Now we present a delay-dependent ∞H  
control of system (2.1) with a given matrix K 
[19].  
Theorem 2.1:  Consider the system (2.1) 
with the state feedback control (2.3).  Suppose

Then the control (2.3) with the matrix K is the 
∞H  control of system (2.1) with the 
disturbance attenuation γγ = . 
 
Now we provide a result to find the 
controller gain K directly.

Then the state feedback gain 10ˆ

Remark 2.1:  Note that the entries for a

for a given positive constant η  of 1Ξ  in 
(2.5b) are affined with respect to their 
respective arguments.  Hence the standard 
LMI optimization approach can be directly 
employed to find the optimization problems 
(2.4a) with (2.4b) and (2.5a) with (2.5b)-(2.5c).

Then the state feedback gain 10ˆ
−= PKK  in 
control (2.2) is the ∞H  control of system (3.1) 
with the disturbance attenuation γγ = . 
Remark 3.1:  The main improvement for 
this project is that the delay-dependent results 
can be obtained without using the model 
transformation techniques and bounded 
inequality with respect to the cross terms [5, 6, 
8, 11, 13, 15].  Hence the obtained results will 
be less conservative and useful in 
delay-dependent conditions [4, 17-18]. 
Remark 3.2:  If the parameter Dh  is 
unknown in system (2.1) or system (3.1), the 
obtained results in Theorems 2.1-3.1 and 
Corollaries 2.1-3.1, are still useful with 01 =P .  
The slow variation constraint ( ) 1<th&  in 
[21-22] is not necessary for all results in this 
project.  Note that all results in this project are 
independent of the parameter Mτ . 
 
4. Static output ∞H  control 
Consider the uncertain neutral system (3.1) 
with (3.2) and the following static output 
control: 
   ( ) ( )txCty y= ,   (4.1a) 
   ( ) ( )tyGtu y−= ,  (4.1b) 
where ( ) pty ℜ∈  is the measurable output, 
np
yC
×ℜ∈  is a given full row rank matrix, 
matrix yG  will be designed or given in 
advance. 
Now we present a delay-dependent ∞H  
control of system (3.1) with (3.2) and (4.1) for 
a given matrix yG . 
Theorem 4.1:  Consider the system (3.1) 
with (3.2) and the static output feedback 
control (4.1).  Suppose the following 
optimization problem:
