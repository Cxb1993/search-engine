administered by two physical therapists to evaluate the subjects’ physical and mental status. 
The subjects were selected from 72 elderly adults residing at the Tai Shun Senior Centre. The selection 
criteria were (1) over 65 years old; (2) no acute medical illness such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, or 
pulmonary infection in the past 3 months; (3) no orthopedic diagnosis;  (4) no muscular disease; (5) BBS 
score ≥41; (6) BI score ≥60; (7) MMSE score >17; and (8) IADL score of ≥7. 
Twenty healthy elderly subjects (age, 68.95 ± 4.59) participated in the study; their mean height, weight, 
and body mass index (BMI) were 158.50 ± 5.85 cm, 59.39 ± 10.24 kg, and 23.55 ± 3.91, respectively. The 
study was approved by the local ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from each subject after a 
full explanation of the experimental project and its procedures was provided. 
 
Apparatus 
In the present study, the GRF was defined as the force applied to the ground by the buttocks and/or the 
feet. Vertical GRFs were recorded from two separate force platforms (size, 500 × 500 mm; accuracy, 0.20 N) 
composed of eight load cells. The distance between the force platforms was 10 mm (Figure 1). A personal 
computer simultaneously saved the two sets of GRF data at 1000 Hz using a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter 
acquisition board (NI PCI-6220; National Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and dynamic amplifiers. The 
amplitude of the force signals were normalized to body mass and expressed as percentage change in body 
weight (% BW).

B was at zero (B0). Tp and Lp occurred when the GRF for curves T and L, respectively, were maximal. Tpw and 
Lpw were the maximal forces of curves T and L, respectively. The GRF oscillated following seat-off, and the 
STS phase ended when the GRF reached body weight. 
Statistical Analysis 
The GRF time recordings were transformed logarithmically (Box & Anderson, 1955). A normal 
distribution test was performed, followed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated 
measures to evaluate the effect of the onset of curves B (Bs), L (Ls), and T (Ts). Significant results were 
followed up using the least significant difference (LSD) method as a post hoc test. The mean times of Tp, Lp, 
and seat-off were compared in a similar manner. Tpw and Lpw were tested using t-tests. A P-value <0.05 was 
deemed statistically significant. The data are expressed as means ± the standard deviation (SD). The Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences-PC version 12 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to conduct the 
statistical tests. 
 
Results 
 
Onset of the STS Movement 
Table 1 shows the mean onset time of the STS movement for each independent variable. The mean times 
for Bs, Ls, and Ts were 6.40 ± 0.24, 6.52 ± 0.27, and 6.60 ± 0.35, respectively. Different aspects of onset 
significantly affected the time of the activating moment (F = 5.67, P < 0.05; ANOVA). The post hoc analyses 
indicated that Bs occurred significantly earlier than Ls and Ts, and that Ls and Ts did not significantly affect the 
activating moment.

(Table 2). These different time points significantly affected the time of the activating moment (F = 14.62, P < 
0.001; ANOVA). Tp, Lp, and seat-off appeared in sequence; the post hoc analyses indicated that the time of Tp, 
Lp, and seat-off were all significant.

Discussion 
 
In the present study, we used two force platforms to investigate the time points of onset, maximum GRF 
of the body and legs, and seat-off in the STS movement of healthy elderly people with no known physical 
impairments or functional disorders. We identified three STS patterns: normal-modal, multimodal, and 
incompetent-modal. 
Our data indicate that Bs is the onset of the STS movement in elderly people and that Ls and Ts are less 
accurate indices in comparison with Bs. Thus, using Ls or Ts to identify STS onset may underestimate the 
duration of the STS movement in elderly people. However, Chang and colleagues (2010) reported that GRF 
component Bs and Ls, which were not significant in the present study, could both be used to mark the onset of 
the STS movement in healthy adults. The age of the participants may explain the difference between our 
findings and those of Chang. Aging causes a decline in strength and coordination associated with changes in 
the neuromuscular apparatus such as a drop in the number of motor units (Shim, Lay, Zatsiorsky, & Latash, 
2004).  
Tp and Lp are the maximum force points of the body and legs respectively. Their physical significance is 
different from that of seat-off, which represents the moment when the buttock leaves the seat. Although 
disagreement exists over the order of these three points (Millington, Myklebust, & Shambes, 1992; O’Meara 
& Smith, 2006; Lindemann et al., 2007), Chang and colleagues (2010) reported the order of Tp, Lp, and 
seat-off in healthy adults using two high-frequency force platforms. Our findings in elderly subjects are 
consistent with those of Chang. Moreover, in the view of resultant and component forces, the maxima forces 
of the whole body and legs show obvious differences during STS movement. The effects of positive force 
generated from the seat should not be ignored when describing the process of the STS movement.

2   Methods 
2.1   Participants 
Twenty healthy elderly subjects (age, 68.95 ± 4.59) participated in the study; their 
mean height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 158.50 ± 5.85 cm, 59.39 ± 
10.24 kg, and 23.55 ± 3.91, respectively. The selection criteria were (1) over 65 years 
old; (2) no acute medical illness in the past 3 months; (3) no orthopedic diagnosis;  
(4) no muscular disease; (5) BBS score ≥41 (6) BI score ≥60 (7) MMSE score >17; 
and (8) IADL score of ≥7. 
2.2   Apparatus 
In the present study, the GRF was defined as the force applied to the ground by the 
buttocks and/or the feet. Vertical GRFs were recorded from two separate force 
platforms (size, 500 × 500 mm; accuracy, 0.20 N) composed of eight load cells. A 
personal computer simultaneously saved the two sets of GRF data at 1000 Hz using a 
16-bit analog-to-digital converter acquisition board (NI PCI-6220; National 
Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and dynamic amplifiers. 
2.3   Procedure 
The subjects sat on an armless chair of standard height (40 cm) on a buttock-force 
platform with their arms folded across the chest. A back support on the chair was used 
to ensure that the subjects’ trunks were leaning back in a standard position, and their 
bare feet were positioned on the leg-force platform. No other restrictions were 
imposed on the initial position. Each subject performed the task in a comfortable and 
natural manner and at a self-selected speed. 
2.4   Measurements 
Figure 1 shows selected GRF parameters. Two curves (B, buttock weight; L, leg 
weight) describing the vertical GRF as a function of time were obtained from the 
force platforms. Curve T was the sum of forces B and L. The time taken to stand up 
was calculated from these curves. Bs, Ls, Ts, the onset of the B, L, and T curves: Tp, 
Lp, maximal GRF at curves T and L; B0, B at zero. Prior to analysis, the data were 
smoothed using the moving-average method. The force data indicated that the 
different sequences of the STS task exhibited specific characteristics that formed 
distinct patterns. Bs, Ls, and Ts occurred immediately after initiation of the action cue 
when the difference between the GRF at that time point and the previous value did not 
equal zero. Seat-off was defined as the time at which the thighs lost contact with the 
chair, when the instant of curve B was at B0. Tp and Lp occurred when the GRF for 
46.29 ± 4.54, and 43 ± 2, respectively. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the 
force pattern and the BBS score.

participants. From left to right: typical-modal (t-modal), multi-modal (m-modal), and

4.   Dscussion 
Our data indicate that Bs is the onset of the STS movement in elderly people and that 
Ls and Ts are less accurate indices in comparison with Bs. Thus, using Ls or Ts to 
identify STS onset may underestimate the duration of the STS movement in elderly 
people. However, Chang and colleagues [3] reported that GRF component Bs and Ls, 
which were not significant in the present study, could both be used to mark the onset 
of the STS movement in healthy adults. The age of the participants may explain the 
difference between our findings and those of Chang. Tp and Lp are the maximum 
force points of the body and legs respectively. Their physical significance is different 
from that of seat-off, which represents the moment when the buttock leaves the seat. 
Although disagreement exists over the order of these three points [6], Chang and 
colleagues [3] reported the order of Tp, Lp, and seat-off in healthy adults using two 
high-frequency force platforms. Our findings in elderly subjects are consistent with 
those of Chang.
