As shown in Fig.1, a gun drill bit consists of 
a driver, a shank and a tip. The tip is made up of 
a hard wear resistant material, such as metallic 
carbide. The tubular shank has a V-shaped flute 
on its surface. The tip is slightly larger in 
diameter than the shank and also has the V-flute. 
The V-groove is designed for chip to be removed 
On the flank surface of the tip, a hole is an outlet for the 
coolant. The other end of the shank incorporates 
an enlarged driver in size having a flat surface 
for holding the drill.  
Gundrilling employs an internal-type cutting 
coolant supply and external chip removal along 
the V-shaped flute.  As shown in Fig.2, the 
coolant is supplied at very high pressure through 
the tubular channel directly to the 
flank-workpiece interface so as to lubricate and 
cool the cutting edge and support pads. Also, the 
high-pressure fluid helps the tool to break the 
chips into small pieces and then pushes the chips 
up the long flutes and out the top of the hole. The 
coolant enters the V-flute where picks up chips 
formed at the cutting edges, and then transport 
chips along the V-flute into the chip box.  
Conventionally, machines with sufficiently high 
spindle speed, coolant supply and a suitable 
range of feeds can be modified for gun drilling. 
However, the best selections of cutting 
conditions are different with special gun drilling 
machines. Simultaneously, a gun drill is a 
combined tool, which carries out two machining 
processes, i.e., drilling by the cutting edges and 
burnishing by the supporting pads. The 
burnishing pads opposite the cutting edge are 
being forced against their side of the hole in the 
drilling processes, acting as a bushing to make 
the cutting process stable.

The extensive use of gun drill in deep hole 
manufacturing has given rise in recent years to an 
increasing volume of research to improve the 
efficiency of this process.  A gun drill with two 
holes was proved to have lower fluid energy loss 
[1], when the effective cross-sectional areas at 
the interface of the V-shank and the tip for 
different types of gun drill were calculated 
theoretically and measured experimentally.   
However, considering the whole gun drilling 
system of coolant channels as a system of 
circular and non-circular cross-sections of fluids 
channels and gun drill geometry, the 
investigation of [2] noticed that the generation of 
swarfs in the coolant transport did not create a 
obvious hydraulic resistance, and the size of the 
coolant holes of the head is not necessarily the 
most influential factor for determining coolant 
flow rate. Thus, a gun drill with a hole will be 
adopted in this study. 
With high accuracy of deep hole in the gun 
drilling, a major problem in practical deep 
drilling is the axial deviation of machined holes 
particularly in the case of a hole with great depth.   
Considering the tool rotating system and 
workpiece rotating system, separately, the study 
[3] investigated the influence of misalignment of 
tool guide bush or tool bar support on the 
deviation of hole. Their results shown that the 
phenomenon of hole runout produced in the 
workpiece rotating system was less than that in 
tool rotating system. Also, accurate hole could be 
machined by piloting action of guide pads, even 
in drilling special workpiece having 
unsymmetrical pre-bored hole. By comparison of 
single- and multi-edge tools, the influence of tool 
geometry on hole deviation was explored [4]. 
Although balanced cutting forces on the tool 
head had the contribution of a decreasing hole 
deviation, their results revealed that, to some 
extent, an unbalanced force was necessary for 
giving accurate hole size. Otherwise, a slightly 
oversized hole generated at a completely 
balanced condition of forces.  An investigation 
[5] was also done in drilling workpiece with the 
inclined front face to descript the influence of 
workpiece geometry on axial hole deviation.  
Also, the work [6] investigated the effect of drill 
workpiece revolving device in this study is 
designed to improve hole deviation. The 
principle is that once hole deviation generates, 
the rotary workpiece will provide a resistance 
force to compel tool head toward the center of 
the drilling hole and revise the center bias of 
drilling hole.  
  
3. Experiments 
The experiment was performed using a 
horizontal gun drilling machine with rotating 
tool system. This machine also becomes a 
rotating workpiece system when the workpiece 
revolving device is equipped.  To understand 
the role of the workpiece revolving device, a 
series of experiments were carried out in two 
cases of rotating workpiece and stationary 
workpiece, repectively. The experimental setup 
shown in Fig.4 focused mainly on all bushings 
and workpiece revolving device. The workpiece 
material was S45C steel, of φ 22mm and 
300mm in length. Coolant pressure was 23 Kg/cm2, 
and flow rate was 60 L/min. The standard gun 
drill tool was adopted, as shown in Fig.5, where 
illustrates geometry parameters of the tool head. 
The gun drill consists of a single coolant hole, 
drill head of cemented carbide, and a shaft with 
V-flute. The tool diameter is φ 12.7 mm and 
900 mm in flute length. All workpieces had 
been polished by grinding before drilling was 
performed. Simultaneously, to avoid severe 
vibration in the first stage taking place from initial 
unstable drilling till outer cutting edge of the tool 
bit completely into workpiece [7], feed speed was 
slowed down until stable drilling arrived.  
Although the workpiece was 300 mm in length, 
the workpiece was drilled to a depth of 290 mm to 
avoid hole runout.

After the drilling test, both 10 mm of the end and 
the start of workpiece was cut. A finally length of 
280mm was obtained. The hole deviation was 
measured for the over length of 280 mm. Fig. 6 
shows a comparison of the sectioned workpiece, 
where the eccentricity of the right hole performed 
by rotating workpiece is obvious.

4. Results and discussions 
 The experiments were carried out using a 
variety of working parameters including (A) tool 
rotational speed (rpm),(B) feed speed (mm/min) 
and (C) workpiece rotational speed (rpm).  
Employing the Taguchi method of parameter 
design [9], an L8 orthogonal array was applied. 
Since only three control factors with respective two 
levels were selected, the other four columns of the 
L8 array were adopted to investigate the 
interactions among the three factors. Also, the 
quality analysis of the hole deviation can be 
obtained by Taguchi method. The Taguchi method 
uses the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, for the 
evaluation characteristic in the optimum setting 
analysis. The S/N ratio, dB in unit, is defined by 
the logarithmic function based on the mean-square 
deviation around the target. The performance of 
hole deviation belongs to the quality characteristic 
of the smaller-the-better. Thus, the S/N ratio can be 
expressed as:

where n is the number of repeated experiment and 
yi the hole deviation at the ith test. Table1 lists the 
control factors, i.e., cutting parameters, and their 
levels. Table 2 lists the experimental design, the 
experimental data and the S/N response ratios. By 
the analysis of mean (ANOM), the response table is 
also listed in Table 2, where the rank is determined 
based on the size of the effect. Fig.7 plots the 
response graphs of hole deviation in S/N ratio.  
 The effects of all control factors and their 
interactions are determined by the analysis of 
effect of control factor could be reasonably 
illustrated by factor response.  As listed in Table 5, 
the F-test results of ANOVA revealed that only the 
workpiece rational speed was significant. With 
stationary workpiece, hole deviation was obviously 
large, at a value over 40 μm/10mm. However, 
once the workpiece rotated, hole deviation 
decreased severely. As shown in Fig.8, hole 
deviations reduced as the workpiece rotational 
speed increase. Thus, the workpiece revolving 
device was effective in the improvement of hole 
deviation.

     To investigate further the effect of the feed 
speed, a series of experiments was performed at a 
fixed tool speed, 1600 rpm. As shown in Fig. 9, hole 
deviation reduced obviously, when workpiece 
rotational speed altered from 0 to 150 mm/min. 
However, with a higher workpiece rotational speed, 
the tendency toward a smaller hole deviation was 
unobvious.

5. Conclusions 
Although highly accuracy of deep hole can 
be obtained in gun drilling, problem of deviation 
of machined hole arises particularly in the case of 
long depth.  To improve the phenomenon of 
hole deviation, a workpiece revolving device 
equipped on working table was designed in this 
study. Round workpiece of φ 22mm in diameter 
and 300mm in length was drilled by a standard 
gun drill tool of φ 12.7 mm in diameter, 
cooperated with a special pilot bushing designed. 
This study aimed at the investigation of 
improvement of this device on the hole deviation. 
Taguchi’s method was applied for experimental 
design. A series of experiments was performed. 
The experimental data were analyzed by F-test in
