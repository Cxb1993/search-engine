Abstract 
In this research, we combine two workforce supply principles, two 
flexible management strategies and the related operating constraints to 
develop four strategic models, in order to help an air cargo terminal 
manage more effectively its terminal workforce supply and set its shift 
schedule under stochastic demands in long-term operations.  The 
models are formulated as integer/mixed integer linear programs that are 
solved using a mathematical programming solver.  To evaluate the 
four models, we also develop the four deterministic-demand models, by 
suitably modifying the four stochastic-demand models, respectively, 
and a simulation-based evaluation method.  Finally, we perform 
numerical tests using real operating data from a Taiwan air cargo 
terminal.  The preliminary results show that the models could be 
useful for planning air cargo terminal workforce supply.

Integer Linear Program, Simulation 
1. Introduction 
An effective terminal workforce supply plan can not only help an air cargo 
terminal (hereinafter called terminal) deal with its cargoes efficiently and maintain 
excellent service quality, but can also reduce their operation cost efficiently.  There 
are many factors that have to be considered in terminal workforce supply planning.  
These factors generally include the workforce demand, the operating constraints (e.g., 
the maximum number of shift starting times in one day), and the operating costs.  In 
past research, a projected and fixed demand has usually been used for the terminal

overall planning procedure mentioned above. 
Personnel scheduling problems can be classified into three groups, according to 
the industry characteristics (Beasley and Cao, 1996).  Each group has often been 
discussed, e.g., the airline crew scheduling (Ryan, 1992; Langerman and Ehlers, 
1997; Teodorović and Lučić, 1998; Yan and Tu, 2002), the mass transit crew 
scheduling (Caprara et al., 1997; Higgins, 1998), the generic crew scheduling 
(Beaumont, 1997; Brusco, 1998; Alfares, 1998; Nobert and Roy, 1998).  Among the 
literature, the study of Nobert and Roy (1998) is more related to our research.  In 
particular, they developed a model and a solution approach to the freight handling 
personnel scheduling problem.  However, they used the projected workforce 
demand, which was difficult to apply to stochastic demands, as used in our research.  
Moreover, the planning period was set to be one day which was difficult to apply to a 
week, as required in our research.  Furthermore, they focused on short-term 
planning which was different from ours.  Besides, flexible management strategies, 
which will be addressed later, were not incorporated in the model.  Consequently, 
Nobert and Roy’s model and solution approach do not satisfy the needs of this 
research.  It should be mentioned that some models have been developed to assist in 
airport apron service scheduling practices, for example, for ground staff scheduling 
(Niklas and Erik, 2001; Sørensen and Clausen, 2002) and aircraft line maintenance 
scheduling (Yan et al., 2004).  Although these problems are related to ours, their 
operating characteristics are different.  As a result, their models or solutions cannot 
be directly applied to our problems.  As to the other studies, they have focuses 
different from that of this research, and thus cannot provide efficient workforce plan 
solutions for air cargo terminals. 
Except the above classification, personnel scheduling problems have also been 
classified into shift scheduling, day-off scheduling and tour scheduling problems 
(Morris and Showalter, 1983).  Each problem has often been discussed, e.g., the 
shift scheduling problems (Lau, 1996; Aykin, 2000), the day-off scheduling problems 
(Narasimhan, 1996), and the tour scheduling problems (Easton and Rossin, 1991; 
Bechtold et al., 1991; Brusco and Johns, 1995; Brusco and Johns, 1996).  Among 
these three categories, although our problem can be classified into the first category, 
the past shift scheduling problems are different from ours, and thus do not satisfy the 
needs of our research.  As to the second and the third categories, they are related to 
the crew assignment stage of the aforementioned planning procedure, and therefore 
are different from ours. 
There has been no research on terminal workforce supply planning considering 
stochastic demands in the past, although planning problems with stochastic 
disturbances have been studied in other fields (e.g., Mulvey and Ruszczynski, 1995; 
Du and Hall, 1997; Yan et al., 2002; Kenyon and Morton, 2003; List et al., 2003).  
After the above review, we found that none of the past research can be applied to our 
research.  In addition, the flexible management strategies that have been widely 
recognized in the industry indicate that management strategies can increase the 
different degrees of freedom in the schedule, thus conserving workforce (Blyton and 
Morris, 1992).  These flexible management strategies however, have not yet been 
applied to air cargo terminal workforce supply plans.  Applying the mathematical 
programming techniques commonly used in personnel scheduling can also be 
beneficial.  Therefore, in this research, we incorporate flexible management 
strategies, and the related operating constraints, to develop a basic stochastic-demand 
 
8
variables becomes known.  In the second stage, a number of decisions can be 
determined after the values of the random variables are realized.  Similar to the 
Mulvey and Ruszczynski (1995) air freight scheduling model, we select, ω , a 
scenario (or a random event), from Ω , the set of all scenarios (all random events).  
That is, we have Ω  stochastic workforce demand scenarios.  According to the 
decision of terminal workforce supply planning and the shift starting times should be 
finished before cargo arrived, this research belong to the first stage of the two-stage 
stochastic optimization process.  Therefore, in this research, we set the first-stage 
decision variables to be the number of workforce variables, isqv , and the shift 
starting time variables, sx , which have to be determined before the weekly 
workforce demands in actual operations can be known. 
2.1.1 SDM 
As seen in the Terminal C’s workforce demand profile, with a rotating timetable 
cycle, demand will fluctuate from time to time.  Sometimes in off-peak hours there 
is even no demand.  If we take into consideration Terminal C practices, two flexible 
strategies, based on numerical and temporal concepts, can be proposed: flexible shifts, 
and flexible working hours.  The flexible shift strategy allows an employer to 
choose the preferable number of shift starting times per day and the shift starting 
times, while the flexible working hour strategy allows the company to hire different 
employees for different working hours.  Both types of flexibility are introduced in 
our model. 
An effective combination of shifts and their starting times, and the number of 
different types of on-duty crews for each shift is the key to a successful workforce 
supply plan.  Using the two proposed flexible strategies, we try to provide an 
effective terminal workforce supply plan, which can respond to wide variations in 
workforce demand.  We list below the symbol notations of parameters and variables 
that will be used in the SDM formulation. 
 
Parameters: 
i  ： the ith day in a week. 
j  ： the jth time slot in a day. 
ω  ： the thω  scenario.  Note that similar to the Mulvey and Ruszczynski’s
model, we select, ω , a scenario to represent a random event from the set 
of all scenarios (all random events). 
Ω   the set of all scenarios.  That is, we have Ω stochastic workforce 
demand scenarios. 
N  ： the set of shift starting times in a day.  The length of a time slot is set to 
be one hour.  Since there are 24 hours in a day; ≡N {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, … , 23}.

Variables:

 and Equations (4), (5), (6) and (7).   
 
To save space, we only introduce below the SDME equations that are different 
from the SDM ones.  Equation (8) is the objective function that minimizes the total 
system cost, including the regular workforce cost, and the negative surplus value of 
excess workforce.  Equation (9) states that the assigned crew members, substracting 
excess workforce, must be able to meet the workforce demands for each scenario in 
every time slot during thieir shift.  Equation (10) is a non-negativity constraint of 
variables.  Note that ( )ωijα  are not constrained to be integers.  However, due to 
constraint (9) and the integrality of ( )ωijd , they are naturally integers.  Similar to 
the SDM, the SDME, which is solved using CPLEX, determines the best set of shifts, 
each with a number of work types, and the excess supplied workforce in each time 
slot, in each day of the week. 
2.1.3 SDMI 
One of the approaches to deal with the drastic fluctuation in workforce demands 
for continuous time slots is to use workforce supplemented by temporary workforce 
from other departments or outside the company, whose unit man-hour cost is 
normally higher than the regular unit man-hour cost, 1c .  Since neither the SDM 
nor the SDME is applicable to this use, we construct another strategic model (SDMI) 
by modifying the SDM, with an inadequate workforce cost, in order to help manage 
workforce more effectively, thus reducing the operating cost.  Apart from the 
previous parameters/variables, we define the new parameters and variables used in 
SDMI as follows: 
 
3c  ： the cost per temporary man-hour supply for insufficient workforce. Insufficient workforce may be supplied by temporary workforce from 
other departments or outside the company.  In practice, 3c  is greater 
than 1c  in long-term operations. ( )ωβij  ： the insufficient workforce (in persons) for scenario ω  in time slot j
on day i . 
 
The SDMI is formulated as a mixed integer linear program as follows: 
 
 
14
temporary workforce supply cost for insufficient workforce.  Equation (15) states 
that the assigned crew members, subtracting excess workforce and adding temporary 
supplied workforce, must be able to meet the workforce demands for each scenario in 
every time slot during their shift.  Note that due to the cost minimization objective ( )ωijα  and ( )ωβ ij  cannot be both positive in time slot j on day i.  Equation (16) is 
a non-negativity constraint of variables.  Note that ( )ωijα  and ( )ωβ ij  are 
naturally integers due to constraint (15) and the integrality of ( )ωijd .  Similar to the 
SDM, the ISDM, which is solved using CPLEX, determines the best set of shifts, 
each with a number of work types, and the excess or temporary supplied workforce 
in each time slot, in each day of the week. 
2.2 Deterministic-Demand Planning Models 
To evaluate the SDM, the SDME, the SDMI and the ISDM, we develop four 
deterministic-demand terminal workforce supply plan models (the DDM, the DDME, 
the DDMI and the IDDM) by modifying the SDM, the SDME, the SDMI and the 
ISDM, respectively.  The deterministic demand, which is simpler and easier for 
solution than the stochastic demand, has been conventionally applied (e.g., see Yan et 
al. 2004).  The modifications are as follows.  First the scenarios are removed and 
are represented by an “average” scenario.  For each time slot, the stochastic demand ( )ωijd  for each scenario is replaced by an expected workforce demand ijd .  In 
addition, the two decision variables, ( )ωα ij  and ( )ωβ ij , for each scenario, are 
replaced by ijα  and ijβ  for the expected scenario.  The new parameters/variables 
are: 
 
ijd  ： the workforce demand (in persons) in time slot j  on day i . 
ijα  ： the excess workforce (in persons) in time slot j  on day i . 
ijβ  ： the insufficient workforce (in persons) in time slot j  on day i . 
 
The other parameter/variable definitions are the same as previously defined.  
These SDM parameters and variables are replaced in the DDM which is similarly 
formulated as an integer linear program.  The objective function and the constraints 
of the DDM are similar to those of the SDM, except that the objective function is the 
minimization of an expected system cost and the constraints are applied to the 
average scenario.  To save space, the DDM model is not discussed in detail here.  
Obviously, the problem size of the DDM is significantly smaller the SDM one.  In 
particular, the SDM problem can be decomposed into multiple independent DDM 
problems, each corresponding to a scenario (e.g., see Ruszczynski and Shapiro, 
2003).  In this respect, the DDM is easier to solve than the SDM.  Similarly, the 
construction of the DDME/DDMI/IDDM is similar to that of the DDM.  To save 
space, the details are not addressed here. 
2.3 Evaluation Method 
To compare the performance of stochastic- and deterministic-models that can be 
 
16
100.  The value per surplus man-hour for workforce supply exceeding demand ( 2c ) 
is set to be -20, because the excess workforce is used for supporting other 
departments to reduce the operating cost.  Since it is not easy to supply temporary 
workforce from other departments or outside the company, the cost per temporary 
man-hour supply for insufficient workforce ( 3c ) is set to be 200 to reflect the real 
practice.  Note that, the three cost values are adjustable in other applications to meet 
the company’s operating requirements. 
Figure 2 illustrates the average hourly terminal workforce demand in man-hours 
per week (1 ~ 168 hours).  The largest terminal workforce demand appears on 
Friday, because most carriers need to send out cargos before the weekend.  On the 
other hand, the least terminal workforce demand occurs on Sunday when most 
companies are on holiday.  In addition, the distribution of the workforce demand is 
also needed because we have to generate different workforce demand scenarios for 
both solution and evaluation processes.  For ease of testing, Terminal C’s 
operational data were used to determine the distribution type, including the mean and 
the standard deviation of the workforce demands.  This follows a truncated normal 
distribution, but can be adjusted for other applications.

3.2 Test results 
Before starting to perform numerical tests, we evaluated a suitable number of 
scenarios and evaluation weeks (i.e., W) to suitably represent the event population, 
Ω .  We found that, after 70 scenarios or evaluation weeks, the results of workforce 
supply were similar, but the computational times increased rapidly.  For ease of 
testing, the number of scenarios and evaluation weeks were both set to be 70, but this 
is adjustable for other applications.  Terminals can use the most suitable numbers of 
scenarios and weeks for their own needs.  In addition, to preliminarily evaluate the 
proposed models, the current manpower supply of Terminal C by the trial-and-error 
experience-based method, is also used and its results obtained are referred to as 
“trial-and-error method” (denoted as TAEM) for simplicity.  Note that the 
manpower demand in the deterministic models and in the TAEM is the average of 70 
manpower demands. 
Table 1 shows the problem sizes and the test results.  OBJ represents the 
system cost for the optimal solution obtained by CPLEX, plus the negative surplus 
value of excess workforce calculated externally for the SDM and for the DDM.  For 
the stochastic models, ISDM yielded the best solution, with an objective value of 
 
18
For the deterministic models, the IDDM yielded the best solution, with an 
objective value of 66900.  The DDMI was next, with an objective value of 67300, 
followed by the DDME and DDM, with the same objective value of 67740.  In 
addition, there is an excess workforce of 33 man-hours for DDME and an insufficient 
workforce of 22 man-hours for DDMI.  Besides, there are an insufficient workforce 
of 10 man-hours and an excess workforce of 10 man-hours for IDDM.  The IDDM 
could help manage workforce more effectively than the other deterministic-demand 
models.  Similar to the stochastic models, the deterministic models all yielded six 
shifts, implying that more shifts would result in greater workforce flexibility and thus 
a better solution.  The computation times were very efficient, except for the DDMI, 
21.28 seconds for the DDM, 46.80 seconds for the DDME, and 22.36 seconds for the 
IDDM.  Similar to the SDMI and the SDMI, the problem was solved by DDMI in 
1325.91 seconds, due to the zero convergence gap set in CPLEX.  Terminal C 
currently has three shift starting times, each being associated with a shift.  The 
TAEM objective value was 70700. 
Although the objectives of the four stochastic models (77442.8, 77442.8, 77428 
and 77338, respectively) are greater than that of the TAEM (70700) and those of the 
deterministic models (67740, 67740, 67300 and 66900, respectively), these results 
should not mislead the reader to assume that the stochastic models performed more 
poorly than the others.  The actual performance of these models should only be 
evaluated after their application to actual operations (which will be discussed later in 
Section 3.3), rather than only to planning. 
All of the above results indicate that both stochastic and deterministic models 
work well and could be useful in actual operations.  To illustrate the model solution 
and save the space, we only show the ISDM solution, the workforce demand and 
their difference (supply minus demand) in Figure 3.

3.3 Evaluation results 
To compare the performance of the stochastic models, the deterministic models 
and the TAEM for real world operations, we used the proposed evaluation method to 
calculate the average objective value ( Z ), the average excess workforce (α ), and the 
average insufficient workforce (β ), for 70 evaluation weeks.  The evaluation results 
are shown in Table 2.  The ISDM yielded the best solution, with the average 
objective value of 77431.8.  The SDMI was next, with the average objective value 
of 77514.6, followed by the SDM and the SDME, with the same objective value of 
 
20
workforce cost per man-hour ( 1c =100) and the cost per temporary man-hour supply 
for an insufficient workforce ( 3c =200).  After comparing the SDME’s objective 
(77442.8) with the SDMI’s objective (77428), we also found that the strategy of 
using an excessive workforce is less effective than that of supplying a temporary 
workforce.  However, taking the combined effect of both strategies, the ISDM 
outperformed both the SDMI and the SDME, each with a single strategy. 
 
3.4 Sensitivity analyses 
To understand the influence of the parameters on the stochastic model solutions, 
we performed a series of sensitivity analysis.  To save space, below we only show 
the results of the workforce demand (mean value) and the results of the standard 
deviation in the workforce demand, both being essential inputs to the proposed 
models.  The reader may contact the authors for the results of the other parameters. 
3.4.1 The workforce demand 
To examine the influence of different demands on the solution, we tested five 
situations, 70%, 85%, 100%, 115% and 130% of the original demand mean.  Each 
situation included 70 scenarios and was tested for 70 evaluation weeks.  Note that 
the workforce demand in the deterministic models is the average of 70 workforce 
demands.  As shown in Figure 4, the greater the demand mean, the greater the 
amount of workforce needed to meet the demand.  As well, for all workforce 
demand situations, the objective values of the five ISDM cases were all better than 
the other ones.  The objective increments from 70% to 130% of the original demand 
were 79400.84 for both the SDM and the SDME, 76559.71 for the SDMI, and 47960 
for the ISDM, indicating the objective values were relatively influenced by the mean 
changes.  The objective differences among the four models ranged from 9.71 to 
29.71 for the 70% case, 25.43 to 78.55 for the 85% case, 14.8 to 104.8 for the 100% 
case, 1439.2 to 14377.3 for the 115% case and 3043.4 to 31848 for the 130% case, 
indicating that the differences in the four models performed became greater in the 
planning stage when the workforce demand was larger.

In addition, as shown in Figure 5, for the deterministic models, as the demand of 
workforce increased from 70% to 130%, the objective values of the four 
deterministic models were all increased (from 55100 to 97900 for both the DDM and 
 
22
3.4.2 Standard deviation in the workforce demand 
To examine the influence of different standard deviations on the solution, we 
tested five situations, 70%, 85%, 100%, 115% and 130% of the original standard 
deviation.  Each included 70 scenarios and 70 evaluation weeks.  Note that the 
workforce demand in the deterministic models is the average of 70 workforce 
demands.  As shown in Figure 6, the more varied the workforce demand, the greater 
the amount of workforce needed to meet the demand.  As well, for all standard 
deviations, the objective values of the five ISDM cases were all better than the other 
ones.  The objective increments from 70% to 130% of the original standard 
deviation were 40902.45 for both the SDM and the SDME, 31741.22 for the SDMI, 
and 6951.14 for the ISDM.  This indicates that the objective values of these four 
stochastic models were relatively influenced by the standard deviation changes.  
The objective differences among the four stochastic models ranged from 9.06 to 
20.50 for the 0.7 case, 15.66 to 46.92 for the 0.85 case, 14.80 to 90.00 for the 1.0 
case, 3542.52 to 13354.00 for the 1.15 case and 9170.29 to 24810.60 for the 1.3 case, 
indicating that the four stochastic models performed more differently as the standard 
deviation became larger in the planning stage.

stochastic demand 
 
For the deterministic models, as shown in Figure 7, as the standard deviation 
increased from 70% to 100%, the objective values of the four deterministic models 
were all decreased (from 70460 to 67740 for both the DDM and the DDME, from 
71700 to 67300 for the DDMI, and from 69660 to 66900 for the IDDM); however, as 
the standard deviation increased from 100% to 130%, the objective values of the four 
deterministic models were all increased (from 67740 to 76980 for both the DDM and 
the DDME, from 67300 to 78200 for the DDMI, and from 66900 to 74500 for the 
IDDM).  We found that the trend of the objective values does not have its regularity 
when the standard deviation increased.  Note that the IDDM yielded a better 
solution than the other deterministic models for each situation, similar to the above 
results.

the SDM.  By suitably modifying the SDM, we further construct three strategic 
models, the SDME, the SDMI and the ISDM, involving different combinations of 
workforce supply strategies, which can help an air cargo terminal manage more 
effectively its terminal workforce supply and set its shift schedule.  The models are 
formulated as integer/mixed integer linear programs that are solved using a 
mathematical programming solver.  To evaluate the SDM, the SDME, the SDMI, 
and the ISDM under stochastic demands, we also develop four deterministic-demand 
models (the DDM, the DDME, the DDMI, and the IDDM), by suitably modifying the 
SDM, the SDME, the SDMI, and the SDMS, respectively, and an evaluation method.  
Numerical tests utilizing real operating data from a Taiwan air cargo terminal were 
performed to preliminarily evaluate the models in the real world.  The results 
showed the four stochastic-demand models could improve over the four 
deterministic-demand models which could in turn improve over the trial-and-error 
method used in actual operations.  Besides, the ISDM was better than the other 
stochastic-demand models in terms of computational efficiency and planning 
flexibility.  In summary, the four stochastic-demand models are efficient and 
effective for terminal workforce supply planning and shift setting in long-term 
operations. 
To understand how the essential parameters could affect the model solutions, 
two sensitivity analyses were also demonstrated.  Although the preliminary test 
results show that the models are potentially useful for planning air cargo terminal 
workforce supplies, especially for Taiwan’s domestic air cargo terminals, more tests 
or case studies should be conducted, so that users can better grasp their limitations, 
before putting them to practical use.  The models and the test results should all be 
useful reference material for air cargo terminals to determine the most satisfactory 
long-term workforce supply schedule.  Finally, the scope of this research is confined 
to the second stage of the long-term terminal workforce supply plan procedure.  
How to integrate the three stages, under stochastic workforce demands, into an 
integrated terminal workforce scheduling model, could be a topic of future research.
