performs well in solving this large-scale pa-
rameter optimization problem. Consequently, 
the evaluation of EGFNN is performed by 
performance comparison with the existing 
fuzzy neural network using benchmark prob-

informatics are adopted to illustrate the use 
and effectiveness of EFNN. The goals of the 
three-year projects, described as below.

evaluation of the core of EFNN for 
multi-input single-output system 
models. 
Year 2 : Advancing EFNN for multi-input 
multi-output system models and ap-
plying EFNN to solve optimal con-
troller design problems. 
Year 3 : Refining EFNN to solve protein 
prediction problems by considering 
the interaction between gene feature 
selection and classifier design, and

terms describe the functions of genes and gene products across 
species by a graph structure and are categorized into three 
branches: molecular function, biological process and cellular 
component [10].  
In this study, we propose a sequence-based method 
Virulent-GO by mining informative GO terms as features for 
predicting bacterial virulent proteins. The sequences of 
bacterial pathogens were obtained from SWISS-PROT [6] and 
VFDB [4]. All the instructive GO terms of these sequences 
were obtained by using BLAST [19] to obtain its homologies 
with known accession numbers which are used to query the 
GOA database [16] consequently. The potential for GO terms 
to discriminate virulent proteins in bacteria has been 
demonstrated by distinct differences between virulent and 
non-virulent proteins. All keywords retrieving from literatures 
[1] which are associated with categories of virulence factors are 
also annotated by GO terms. All the GO terms appearing in 
both sets of instructive GO terms and the GO terms from 
keywords are denoted as essential GO terms. A point of 
integrative view from the instructive GO term set and the 
essential GO term set can reveal a few nature of complexity 
from virulence factors in bacterial pathogens. 
The abilities of instructive GO terms combined with various 
widely-used classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors, 
NaïveBayes, decision tree and SVM, to predict bacterial 
virulent proteins have been evaluated by five-fold 
cross-validation scheme. After the evaluations of some 
classifiers, the high-performance method Virulent-GO utilized 
a well-trained SVM classifier and these informative GO terms 
to classify bacterial virulent proteins.  
Virulent-GO using the single kind of GO term features with 
an accuracy of 82.5% is slightly better than VirulentPred [7] 
with 81.8% using five kinds of sequence-based features. For 
the evaluation of independent test, Virulent-GO also yields 
better results (82.0%) than VirulentPred (80.7%). When 
evaluating single kind of feature with SVM, the GO term 
feature performs much well, compared with each of the five 
kinds of features. 
II. METHODS 
A. Overview of Constructing Virulent-GO 
The design of Virulent-GO is a two-stage approach to 
classifying virulent proteins in bacterial pathogens utilizing the 
single kind of GO term features. At the first stage, sequences in 
the given training dataset are used to obtain their homologies by 
using BLAST. The accession numbers of homologies were 
used to query the GOA database to obtain a set of instructive 
GO terms. All sequences in the training dataset are represented 
as a vector of instructive GO terms. Additionally, a set of 
essential GO terms is collected. The flowchart of generating 
feature vectors of instructive GO terms and essential GO terms 
is shown in Fig. 1. 
At the second stage, a good classifier for utilizing the 
instructive GO terms is determined by evaluating some 
widely-used classifiers. The high-performance classifier 
determined is further evaluated using an independent test 
dataset. The details are described below. 
B. Preparing Datasets 
A training dataset and two independent test datasets obtained 
from VirulentPred [7] were used to evaluate the proposed 
method Virulent-GO. Protein sequences in these datasets were 
retrieved from SWISS-PROT [6] and VFDB [4]. These 
datasets contained virulence factors of bacterial pathogens and 
scale the redundancy that each sequences shares identities

data mining task in Java [20]. Three common classifiers are 
accessed: These are IBk (k-nearest neighbor classifier), 
NaïveBayes and J48 (C4.5 decision tree). The IBk was 
performed with k = 1, 3 and 5. The NaïveBayes was performed 
with two different modes that are applied a kernel estimator for 
numeric attributes or just assumed as normal distribution. The 
J48 was evaluating by considering confidence factor from 0.1 
to 0.5 with a stepwise of 0.05 each and all in a default minimum 
number, 2 of instances per leaf. The confidence factor was 
found at 0.15 for maximized accuracy. 
Otherwise, an SVM classifier is implement by LIBSVM [21]. 
By applying grid search toolkits LIBSVM provided, this SVM 
model was optimized both in cost C and kernel parameter γ 
corresponded to using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. 
These two essential parameters are selected from exponent in a 
range from -7 to 5 with base 2. Note that performing these

(6.02). There are 167 virulent proteins annotated with no GO 
terms from their homology while only 4 non-virulent proteins 
have no annotated GO term. In contract to the instructive GO 
terms, the numbers are similar for non-virulent proteins (288) 
and virulent proteins (289) annotated without any essential GO 
terms. Although a wider range of essential GO terms (65 to 60 
for virulent proteins) is used to annotated non-virulent proteins, 
the virulent proteins are annotated by more essential GO terms 
(2.04) than non-virulent proteins (1.64) in average amount. 
Moreover, a large numbers of virulent proteins were annotated 
by several GO terms. This trend could be seen from a 
frequency-distribution in Fig.2. A clear difference was shown 
since essential GO terns g get larger than 3. 
Most of keywords are successfully accessing to both 
non-virulent proteins and virulent proteins via retrieving some 
essential GO terms. Many of they even access hundreds of 
proteins. The essential GO terms set is constructed across three 
major branches, and 52 essential GO terms still are shared by 
both non-virulent proteins and virulent proteins. Thus, a proper 
classifier should be applied to archive a successful prediction. 
Although keywords like “Colonization“, “Iron acquisition” 
and “PhoP/PhoQ two component system” assess to 0 proteins 
for no GO term own by them could be recognized as a essential 
GO term, a typical example that is catered to   “Iron 
acquisition”, “Siderophore receptor” is querying and access to 
few proteins. Also, “PhoP/PhoQ two component system” and 
“ABC transport system” are in the same situation. Besides, 
there are two keywords retrieved certain GO terms but were 
failure to intersecting with instructive GO terms. They are 
“Immune response inhibitor” and “Biofilm”.  
B. Assessment of Features and Classifiers 
To evaluate performance across widely-used classifiers, this 
study applied four kind of classifiers that are IBk (k-nearest 
neighbor), J48 (Decision Tree), NaïveBayes and SVM.  With 
five-fold cross-validation, this turned out a strong support for 
the predictive power orientated form instructive GO terms. The 
accuracy was archived up to 82.5% (SVM), 80.0% (J48) and 
79.5% (NaïveBayes). Even a lazy classifier IBk like could 
make out an accuracy of 78.6%. On the others hand, using 
instructive GO terms set to classify virulent proteins turned out 
a better performance (Accuracy 82.5% ) compared to several 
generic features that are amino acids composition (72.1%), 
dipeptide composition (71.1%), similarity search (52.1%) and 
PSSM profile (78.1%). 
 
 
Fig. 2 The number of essential GO terms annotated in each protein is 
shown in this frequency distribution graph. 
 
The five-fold cross-validation scheme is also used to 
evaluating performance for Training Dataset-1 and Training 
Dataset-2 by combining with widely-used classifiers to 
demonstrate the efficiency of essential GO terms. Due to 288 
non-virulent and 289 virulent proteins have no essential GO 
terms annotated, they could be recognized as a same class and 
lead to a lot of false positives or false negatives. These results 
could be seen from Table VIII. After excluding these proteins,
