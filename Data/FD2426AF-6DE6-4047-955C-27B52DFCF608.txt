 new product contributes significantly to sales and profits (Koufteros et al., 2005). New 
products are increasingly cited as the key to corporate success in the market (Gonza´lez 
and Palacios, 2002). NPD managers are thus under pressure to improve their company’s 
NPD performance (Gupta and Wilemen, 1996; Nijssen and Frambach, 2000). It is 
therefore that the importance of NPD for corporate survival, growth and development is 
widely acknowledged (Nijssen and Frambath, 2000; Pun and Chin, 2005), and both the 
practitioner and scholars have focused on the issue of “how to organize and manage the 
NPD process effectively” (Millson et al., 1992; Crawford, 1992; Nijssen and Frambath, 
2000). 
Although industries are aware of the importance and key role of NPD process in the 
long-term business development and put more effort in the management of NPD process, 
the failure rate of new products remain high, failure rates up to 40% are reported (Urban 
and Hauser, 1993; Cooper and Edgett, 2003), and the costs of failure are substantial 
(Cooper, 1994; Song et al., 1997). Several recent studies show new product success rate at 
launch of less than 60%; 54.3% for the UK, 59.8% for Japan (Edgett et al., 1992), 59% for 
the USA (Griffin, 1997) and 49% for Spain (Palacios and Gonza´lez, 2002). The UK 
manufacturing Attitudes Survey which researched 200 companies for the engineering and 
process sectors, reported that only 23% of those surveyed reported that they had delivered 
all new products in time (Tennant and Roberts, 2003). 
What are the major reasons of high failure rate of new products? Actually, there are 
several key factors, but many researchers asserted that low levels of penetration for tools 
and techniques to aid new product development is the seriously internal obstacle to 
successful introduction of new product (Mahajan and Wind, 1992; Kueng, 2000; Nijssen 
and Frambach, 2000; Tennant and Roberts, 2003). The effective use of NPD tools and 
techniques has been a important strategy of managing integration in the NPD process. In 
this turbulent environment, the firms require new methods and techniques to bring 
successful new products to the marketplace (Gonza´ lez and Palacios, 2002). Thus, 
numerous tools and techniques have been developed over the years to make the NPD 
process more manageable and successful (Thia et al., 2005). 
The NPD tools and techniques are used to identify problems and improve on NPD 
process, and help their users monitor and evaluate their NPD projects systematically 
(Nijssen and Frambach, 2000). As a result, they can be used to improve management’s 
decision quality at different stages of NPD process, and thus to improve the overall 
success rate of new products (Mahajan & Wind, 1992; Nijssen and Frambach, 2000). 
Several studies asserted that the significantly positive impacts on the new products 
development (Greenwald and Ottenfeld, 1989; Mahajan and Wind, 1992; Nijssen and 
Frambach, 2000; Gonza´lez and Palacios, 2002; Thia et al., 2005). 
Despite the benefits of the usage of tools and techniques in NPD, some researches 
reported a relatively low usage of such tools and techniques in NPD process (Mahajan and 
Wind, 1992; Lamb and Dale, 1994; Nijssen and Lieshout, 1995). Studies also show that 
systematic application of tools in NPD is still not as widespread as compared to the

The determination of the stages in NPD process 
“How to use the NPD tools and techniques effectively” is the important incentive or the 
industries to adopt these tools and techniques. It is therefore that the firms need to know 
where (which stages of NPD process) the tools or techniques can be used appropriately 
and effectively. Thus, we need to determine the stages of NPD process to be considered in 
this research. First, we referred several researches. Nijssen & Frambach (2000) considered 
8 stages in NPD process: idea generation, idea screening, concept development and 
testing, marketing strategy, business economic analysis, product development, market 
testing, and commercialization. Sun and Wing (2005) suggesting 4 stages: ideas 
generation & conceptual design, definition & specification, prototype and development, 
and commercialization. Thia et al. (2005) listed the stages of NPD for 7 reviewed 
companies. These companies have different stages in the NPD process. Besides referring 
these studies, we also investigated the actual stages of NPD commonly used in industries 
in Taiwan. In addition to referring to the stages listed in these various studies, an 
investigation was made of the stages of NPD as commonly practised in Taiwanese firms, 
together with an analysis of the tools or techniques commonly used at each stage.

The research framework 
In this research, we want to analyze the usage status of NPD tools and techniques on the 
NPD process. We also analyze the impacts of each tool or technique on the effectiveness. 
These relationships can display as Figure 2. 
 
The design of questionnaire 
In this research, the empirical study is based on the structured questioning (through postal 
or e-mail questionnaire). The questionnaires were designed with five parts: 
z The usage frequency of NPD tools and techniques. 
z The effectiveness extents of NDP tools and techniques. 
z In the stages of NPD process, identify the tools and techniques which are “often to 
use”, and which are “sometime to use”. 
z The results of the key performance indicators. 
z The basic information concerning the respondent. 
The metric of first, second and fourth parts were measured using a 1-5 scale of Likert-type, 
“1” for the lowest degree, “5” for the greatest degree.

3.THE SURVEY 
The study on high-tech companies because, in general, high-tech companies have devoted 
relatively more attention to the development of new product than other enterprises. It is 
therefore that we randomly select 500 companies located in Hsinchu and Taichung 
Science Park as the research sample. At the initial stage of research, the authors visited the 
five R&D managers and CEOs of high-tech companies, in order to understand the usage 
situation of NPD tools and techniques in high-tech industries. Their insights also helped to 
confirm the effectiveness of the questionnaire design. Then, questionnaires were sent to 
these 500 sample companies by using post or e-mail. There were 90 valid questionnaires

In different stages of NPD process, the usages of the NPD tools and techniques are 
very different. In the “development proposal” stage, the tools “project management (the 
rate of “often to use” is 28.89% and the rate of “sometime to use” is 15.56%)”, and 
“brainstorming” (he rate of “often to use” is 23.33% and the rate of “sometime to use” is 
24.44%), are most often used by industries, see Table 5. The following are 
“benchmarking”, “cross-functional teams”, “knowledge management”, and “conjoint 
analysis”. In the “project planning” stage, the situation of usage of the NPD tools and 
techniques is similar to the “development proposal” stage. Otherwise, “supplier 
involvement”, and “QFD” are sometime to use by many companies. In these two proposal 
and planning stages, the technique tools, like as CAD, CAM, CAE, DOE, DFX, etc., are 
seldom used by the firms. 
In the stage of “product design”, the usage rates of the NPD tools and techniques are 
very high, especially the technique tools. Most firms use the tools “computer-aided system: 
CAD, CAM, CAE”, very often (the rate of “often to use” is 66.67%, the rate of “sometime 
to use” is 12.22%, and the total rate is 78.89%, this is very high). The tools “specific 
design software system”(51.11%, 12.22%) and “project management”(50.00%, 17.78%) 
are also used very often by the firms. Some other tools or techniques, “modular design”, 
“PDM”, “cross-functional teams”, “KM”, “simulation”, “collaborative design”, 
“FMEA/DFMEA”, “brainstorming”, “DOE” are used by many companies. 
In the “prototype and test” stage, “project management”, “DOE”, and 
“cross-functional teams” are often used by industries. Tools or techniques “fishbone 
analysis”, “computer-aided systems: CAD, CAM and CAE”, “PDM”, “simulation” are 
adopted by many companies. Tool “project management” has the most usage rate in the 
following two stages. 
In the “process development & pilot run” stage, “cross-functional teams”,
