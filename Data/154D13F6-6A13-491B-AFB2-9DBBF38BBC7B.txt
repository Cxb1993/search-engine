above-mentioned fabrication methods can partially overcome dry etching and 
adhesion problems but are not easily compatible with semiconductor manufacturing. 
Two kinds of copper interconnect fabrications are extensively applied in interconnects 
and metal bumping: Cu-electroplating and Cu-electroless deposition, respectively. 
Cu-electroless deposition is a method to deposit Cu directly on the barrier layer such 
as Ta, TaN, Ti, TiN, W, NiB, or AlN (Refs. 14–19) by sensitization, activation, and a 
replacement process that possesses film characteristics analogous to 
Cu-electroplating; but its chemical and physical properties are still not superior to that 
of Cu-electroplating. Recently, a variety of liner materials as a conductive layer and 
barrier layer for direct Cu-electroplating were examined, including Pt, Pd, Ru, Os, and 
Ir, where the formation enthalpy of the metal oxide is smaller than that of Cu oxide 
(20–24) Among these materials, Ni bears low electrical resistivity and high thermal 
stability, and has a potential compatible with conventional silicon complementary 
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. However, it is rarely used as a 
direct Cu-electroplating template material because of its inherent passive film 
exposure to air. If nickel’s inherent passive film can be overcome using a pretreatment, 
then it will be a superior candidate for direct Cu-electroplating. In this paper, 
circle-shaped Ni pattern will be used directly as a Cu-electroplating template to 
fabricate Cu film with doughnut-like metal periodic arrays. The morphology of array 
with and without protein added and the corresponding samples, the reflectance among 
visible to mid-infrared, as well as the magnetic behavior of those samples through low 
temperature magnetization will be investigated. 
 
Experiment  
 
The substrates in our experiments were (100)-oriented p-type wafers coated with a 
400-nm SiO2 (thermal oxides) as a dielectric layer and a 50-nm Ni as a direct 
Cu-electroplating conductive layer. The resistivity of as-deposited Ni is 4.85 µΩ-cm. 
Ni hole arrays of 1.6µm period and 0.8µm hole diameter on SiO2 were repeated over 
the entire 6-inch wafer as a cathode template to construct a mixed-metal array. The Ni 
arrays were fabricated by conventional optical lithography, followed by a 
high-density plasma-etch tool. Nickel oxide (NiO) must be removed prior to 
electroplating. Then, the cathode was immediately rinsed with deionized water to 
prevent it from oxidizing again. The basic three-additives electroplating formulations 
were used in this paper, formed by mixing 80 g/L CuSO4, 200 g/L H2SO4, 80 g/L HCl, 
and some additives, such as accelerators, suppressors, and levelers. The semi-auto 
electroplating equipment was applied to deposit Cu on Ni film and Ni arrays, and the 
area of the cathode electrode was a 6-inch wafer. The electroplating conditions were

incidents. 
(a) (b) (c) 
possible reason is that the magnetization of protein additive has very little effect on 
photonic phenomena due to a very low value in the paramagnets. Another part of the 
reason is contributed from processing non-uniformity, which can be found from the 
SEM and MFM pictures.  
 
The spectra of protein-added samples investigated after low temperature 
magnetization treatment is as shown in Fig. 8 and 9. Only the Near-IR and Mid-IR 
incident regions of MMT- and Ferritin-added samples were demonstrated and omitted 
the other spectra due to no significant changes throughout the whole measuring. The 
impressive changes of these spectra after magnetized treatment are minimized in the 
difference among S, P and no polarized light incidence. We supposed that the 
magnetized processing aligned the added protein and smoothed out the random 
distribution fraction. Even when the magnetic value is as low as under a room 
temperature environment, the alignment effect can still be observed from the FTIR 
reflectance measurement. However, the application requirement of bio-sensing is 
needed to increase the sensitivity of devices. Thus, shrinking the device size and 
increasing the sensitivity of the measurement tool is very important in the application 
of nano science.
