化合物的 67–100%。 
將各測站底泥總丁基錫平均濃度由高自低排序後發現，修造船廠及漁港區域(測站 8 中船
碼頭、測站 4 民營造船廠、測站 2 旗津漁港、測站 3 海軍修造船廠、測站 6 前鎮漁港)的總丁
基錫平均濃度 45–121 ng Sn g-1 dry wt 最高，其次為河川注入口區域(測站 5 前鎮河口、測站 7
鹽水港溪、測站 9 第五船渠口及測站 10 愛河口)，其總丁基錫平均濃度為 10–17 ng Sn g-1 dry 
wt，而測站 1 港外背景點底泥總丁基錫平均濃度(5 ng Sn g-1 dry wt )最低(圖 2)。修造船廠底
泥丁基錫化合物濃度相對較其它測站高，可能因在修護或建造船隻時，船殼所刮除的船漆直
接排入港區而沉積或船舶重新上漆，使含有高濃度之丁基錫釋出，因而造成此區域之丁基錫
濃度相對較其它區域高。漁港區域主要為漁船停靠，頻繁的航運及漁船船殼外部補修將含有
丁基錫船漆釋出，可能是造成此區域濃度次高之原因。上述顯示，港區有機錫化合物主要由
港區內之修造船廠及漁港作業所貢獻，與其它污染物如重金屬及有機污染物為河川上游所貢
獻之情況不同(Chen et al., 2007)。

ABSTRACT 
 
The distribution of butyltin compounds in the sediments and seawater, especially those at the 
river outfall, fishing port, shipyard and industrial zone dock of Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan 
were investigated. Twenty sediment and seawater samples were collected from various 
locations in the Harbor from May to September 2006, and analyzed for monobutyltin (MBT), 
dibutyltin (DBT), and tributyltin (TBT) to assess the presence of butyltin compounds. 
Investigation results show that concentrations of total butyltins (BTs) varied from 1.5 to 151 
ng Sn g-1 dry wt in sediment samples, whereas TBT was the large proportion of butyltin 
compounds of the sediment samples. This suggests that sediments could be the most possible 
sink of TBT due to the occurrence of sorption mechanism. The concentrations of BTs ranged 
from 9.7 to 270 ng Sn L-1 in seawater samples, whereas DBT and MBT, the degradation 
byproducts of TBT, were mainly the most abundant butyltin compounds of the seawater 
samples. This indicates that the high abiotic or microbiological degradation of TBT. Spatially, 
BTs distribution exhibited highest concentrations in both water and sediment samples in the 
shipyard and fishing port areas. This indicates that the shipping activities (e.g., navigation, 
ship repair, ship building), would cause the distribution of BTs in the environment. Results 
show that the concentrations of degradation products (DBT and MBT) had significant positive 
relationships with seawater temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll-a. 
This implies that seasonal changes of the water parameters controlled the degradation of TBT 
in seawater. The observed levels of butyltin compounds in both seawater and sediments were 
much higher than those required to induce toxic effects on marine organisms suggesting that 
appropriate TBT control strategies should be taken in Kaohsiung Harbor.

1. INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Organotin compounds (OTCs) comprise a Sn atom covalently bound to one or more organic 
substituents (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and phenyl). These compounds are general 
represented the formulas RnSnX4-n, where R is any carbon-bonded organic group, X is an 
anionic species (e.g. halide, oxide or hydroxide) and n = 1–4. The toxic potentials of OTCs 
depend on both the nature and the number of the organic group bound to the Sn cation. In 
general, the toxicity increases in the order RSn+3 < R2Sn+2 < R3Sn+ (Zinagaro, 1979, Valkirs

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
2.1 Sampling strategy 
 
Seawater and sediments samples were collected from river outfalls, fishing ports, and 
shipyards. Ten sampling stations selected in this study included one outer harbor station (1. 
reference station) and nine inner harbor stations (2. Navy Shipyard, 3. Chyi–Jihn Fishing Port, 
4. Private Shipyard, 5. Jen–Gen River Outfall, 6. Jen–Gen Fishing Port, 7. Salt River Outfall, 
8. China Shipbuilding (CSB) Shipyard, 9. Canon River Outfall and 10. Love River Outfall) 
(Fig. 1). The sampling depths of Stations 1 to 10 were 24.7, 9.7, 5.5, 7.6, 11.2, 13.6, 11.3, 
10.1, 7.2, and 4.6 m, respectively. 
 
 
Fig. 1 The Study area and sampling sites. 
 
2.2 Sampling collection 
 
A fishing boat was hired to collect the sediment and seawater samples from various locations 
in the Kaohsiung harbor during May and September 2006. A 6” × 6” × 6” Ekman Dredge grab 
sampler (Jae Sung International Co.) was employed to collect the sediment samples. 
Immediately after collection, the samples were transferred to polyethylene bags and kept in an 
icebox, and then transported to the laboratory for analysis. In the laboratory, the samples were 
kept at -20  until further processing and analysis. A 5℃ -L water sampler was employed to 
collect the seawater samples. Immediately after collection, samples were transferred to 2 L 
amber bottles with acid-washed and high purity solvent rinsed and placed in a cooler at 4℃. 
In the laboratory, the samples were kept at 4℃ before use.   
 
2.3 Chemicals 
2008 Asian-Pacific Regional Conference on Practical Environmental Technologies  
June 30-July 1, 2008, Quezon City, Philippines 
 3A 1−5  
An Agilent 4890D Series gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 7673 
autosampler, a HP-5 capillary column (15 m × 0.53 mm × 0.25 μm), a flame photometric 
detector (FPD) and a tin–specific filter (610 nm) was used to separate and quantify the 
butyltin compounds. The column temperature was initially held at 70℃ for 3 min, raised to 
250℃ at the rate of 15℃ min-1 and then was held at this temperature for 5 min. Three 
microlitre of sample or blank or standard mixture was injected in the splitless mode at 250℃ 
injection temperature. Detector temperature was kept at 250℃. Nitrogen was used as a carrier 
gas (6 ml min-1). Hydrogen and air flows were maintained at 75 and 100 ml min-1, 
respectively. 
In this study, the concentrations of butyltin compounds were expressed as Sn for seawater and 
a dry weight basis for sediment. 
 
2.5 Quality control 
 
Five point calibration curve (20 to 320 pg as Sn), procedural bank and check standard were 
carried out for every set of samples. The linear regression coefficient of calibration curve 
showed an acceptable linear correlation (r2 > 0.995), the procedural banks value were always 
smaller than the limit of detection (LOD), and the recoveries of check standard ranged from 
85% to 100%. The LOD of the analytical procedure was estimated from three time standard 
deviation from repeated (n=7) analysis butyltins of 20 pg as Sn, and the amount of sample 
extracted. The detection limits of butyltins were: MBT (0.5), DBT (0.6), and TBT (0.4) for 
sediment (ng Sn g-1dry wt), and MBT (0.9), DBT (1.2), and TBT (0.8) for seawater (ng Sn L-

(NRCC), certified for TBT (890±105 ng Sn g-1dry wt), DBT (1,047±64 ng Sn g-1dry wt), and 
MBT (600 ng Sn g-1dry wt) concentrations were used. The measured value for TBT, DBT and 
MBT in PACS–2, were 830±24, 997±11, and 497±7 ng Sn g-1dry wt (n = 3), respectively. 
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DICUSSIONS 
 
3.1 Distribution of butyltins in sediment 
 
The grain size (sand, silt, and clay) distribution, concentrations of organic matter, MBT, DBT, 
TBT, and BTs, as well as BDI values in sediments are shown in Table 1. Stations 2 to 10, 
inner Kaohsiung harbor, had the highest silt contents (50.8 to 81.3%) and the lowest sand 
contents (8.1 to 44.5%); whereas station 1, outer Kaohsiung harbor, had the highest sand 
contents (80.7 to 97.4%) and the lowest silt contents (2.4 to 16.6%). Mean clay contents were 
in the range of 0.22 to 13.1%. OMs concentration varied from 2.0 to 12.0 %. The highest 
OMs concentration (mean 11.0%) was found at Station 9 vicinity of the mouths of Canon 
River. The lowest OM concentration (mean 2.2%) was found at Station 1, outer Kaohsiung 
harbor.  
TBT was present in all the 20 sediment samples collected from the Kaohsiung harbor. TBT 
concentrations varied from 1.6 (station 1) to 125.0 ng Sn g-1 dry wt. (station 8) and 1.5 
(station 1) to 99.2 ng Sn g-1 dry wt. (station 8) in sediment samples collected from the

fishing boats and used for shipping activities, shows intermediate levels of BTs (10±10.7 to 
16.9±5.6 ng Sn g-1 dry wt.). The result suggests the major contribution of BTs came from 
shipping activities such as navigation, ship repair, and ship building activities. 
Table 2a shows the spearman correlation coefficients for sediment butyltin concentrations. 
There were significant correlations between MBT, DBT and TBT (p <0.01, r = 0.76–0.83), 
imply that MBT and DBT were degradation from TBT. The significant correlations between 
lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) (p<0.01, r = 0.73–0.95), and also 
significant correlations with OMs (p<0.01, r = 0.72–0.85) (Chen et al., 2007) (Table 2b). 
Table 2c shows the TBT significant correlations with fine particle (e.g. clay and silt) 
(p<0.01，r = 0.57), and significant negative correlations with sand (p<0.05，r = -0.56), but 
not significant correlations with OMs (p>0.05) (Regoli et al., 2001) and metals.

TBT was present in all the seawater samples collected from the Kaohsiung harbor. TBT 
concentrations varied from 11.6 (station 1) to 175 ng Sn L-1 (station 6) and 2.6 (station 1) to 
54.9 ng Sn L-1 (station 2) in seawater samples collected from the Kaohsiung harbor during 
May and September 2006, respectively. DBT was also present in all the seawater samples. 
DBT varied from 16.5 (station 7) to 52.6 ng Sn L-1 (station 8) and 4.5 (station 9) to 11.9 ng Sn 
L-1 (station 3) during May and September 2006, respectively. MBT was detected at stations 
1–4 and 6–10 sampled in May 2006 and at stations 1-6 and 8-9 sampled in September 2006. 
At these stations, MBT varied from 3.2 (station 9) to 127 ng Sn L-1 (station 3). BTs 
concentrations varied from 49.5 (station 1) to 270 ng Sn L-1 (station 6) and 9.7 (station 1) to 
79.3 ng Sn L-1 (station 2) in seawater samples collected from the Kaohsiung harbor during 
May and September 2006, respectively. Degradation products DBT and MBT were mainly 
the most abundant butyltin compounds of the seawater samples indicating the high abiotic or 
microbiological degradation of TBT (Table 3). In addition, the BTs concentration of seawater 
sampled in May 2006 were high than September 2006 (Table 3), that suggested BTs 
degradation processes depending on several surrounding conditions such as temperature 
and/or light. 
Figure 3 shows the mean BTs concentrations with high to low in seawater from this study. 
The distribution of butyltins in seawater were similar to sediment, relatively high levels of 
BTs observed at stations Jen–Gen Fishing Port (station 6; 147±173 ng Sn L-1), Chyi–Jihn 
Fishing Port (station 3; 126±74 ng Sn L-1), Private Shipyard (station 4; 107±76 ng Sn L-1), 
Navy Shipyard (station 2; 99±27 ng Sn L-1), CSB Shipyard (station 8; 80±65 ng Sn L-1). The 
river outfall locations, which are used for berthing fishing boats and used for shipping 
activities, showed intermediate levels of BTs (35±28 to 56±62 ng Sn L-1). The result 
suggested the major contribution of BTs were shipping activities from harbor itself. 
Table 4a shows the significant correlations between MBT, DBT and TBT (p <0.01, r = 0.62–
0.68) in seawater, imply that MBT and DBT were degradation from TBT. The concentrations 
of degradation products (DBT and MBT) showed significant positive relationships with 
seawater temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll-a (p<0.01，r = 0.69–
0.83) (Table 4b), these water parameters changed with the season implying these controlling 
the degradation of TBT at these seawater. 
 
3.3 TBT degradation 
 
TBT degradation in aquatic systems may be occurred via step by step debutylation of TBT to 
DBT and MBT (Hoch, 2001). Debutylation can be caused by ultraviolet (UV) photolysis, 
biological cleavage, and chemical cleavage (Hoch, 2001). In seawater, microbial degradation 
and UV photolysis are the major degradation mechanism in water column, but only anaerobic 
biodegradation can occur for sediment (Dowson et al., 1993b). TBT half–life in seawater is 
generally estimated approximately between 6 days to a few weeks (Omae, 2003). It is highly 
variable depending on several surrounding conditions such as pH, temperature, turbidity and 
light (Díez et al., 2007). In sediment, TBT is extreme stability, where has a half-life in the 
range of 1.3–8.7 years (De Mora et al., 1995; Stewart and Thompson, 1997). Biotic 
degradation processes may be the major mechanism for TBT removal from sediment 
(Amouroux et al., 2000), but on absence of oxygen conditions the degradation responsible for 
slower, and half–life may be than 10 years (Loch et al., 1990).

3.4 Level of butyltins contamination 
 
Butyltin levels found in this study (nine inner harbor stations) were comparable to those 
reported in different regions of the world (Table 5). In general, butyltin levels in the sediment 
samples of Kaohsiung Harbor were relatively less than those reported such as the Kochi 
harbor and Mumbai harbor in India (Bhosle et al., 2006), estuaries of Gipuzkoa in Spain 
(Arambarri et al., 2003), and coast of Mediterranean in Spain (Díez et al., 2002). However, all 
of the sampled sediments exceeded the ecotoxicological assessment criteria of 2 to 21 ng Sn 
g-1 dry wt as proposed by the Oslo–Paris Commission (OSPAR, 2002). In addition, TBT-
contaminated sediments classification was suggested by Dowson et al. (1993a): 
concentrations below 1.2 ng Sn g-1 dry wt indicates no contaminated; 1.2–8.2 ng Sn g-1 dry wt 
is lightly; 8.2–41 ng Sn g-1 dry wt is moderately; 41–205 ng Sn g-1 dry wt is highly and above 
205 ng Sn g-1 dry wt is grossly. According to this classification, the sediment samples of river 
outfall stations (5. Jen–Gen River Outfall, 7. Salt River Outfall, 9. Canon River Outfall and 10. 
Love River Outfall) in this study can be classified as lightly to moderately contaminated, the 
fishing port stations (3. Chyi–Jihn Fishing Port and 6. Jen-Gen Fishing Port) and Shipyard 
stations (2. Navy Shipyard, 4. Private Shipyard, 8. China Shipbuilding (CSB) Shipyard) can 
be classified as moderately to highly contaminated. 
The butyltin levels in the seawater samples of Kaohsiung Harbor were similar to those 
reported in some other regions of the world (Table 5) e.g. in the north west coast of Spain 
(Rodriguz-Gonzalez et al., 2006); in the west coast of India (Bhosle et al., 2004) and coast of 
Bermuda (Connelly et al., 2001). In contrast with coast of Korea (Shim et al., 2005), 
Singapore (Basheer et al., 2004) and north coast of Kyoto in Japan (Ohji et al., 2007), the 
butyltin levels from Kaohsiung Harbor were higher. All of the sampled seawater exceeded 
those required to induce toxic effects on marine organisms such as 0.4–0.8 ng Sn L-1 of TBT 
in water can cause imposex in rock shells, Thais clavigera and Thais bronni (Horiguchi et al., 
1994; IPCS, 1990).

sediments and seawater were contaminated with butyltin compounds although the ban on 
tributyltin-containing antifouling paint on ships of less than 25 m has been effective since 
2003 in Taiwan. However, gradual degradation of butyltin compounds can be expected in the 
harbor because TBT will be removed from all ships hulls by the year of 2008 in Taiwan.
