1. Purpose and expected results 
1.1. Summary 
In the first year, the proposed research focus on define and evaluate KSFs for e-supply chain 
integration during system implementation phases and system operation phases respectively. This 
research will leverage experiences gathered form managers and executives who actively 
participated in a real-world project that successfully established seamless e-supply chain integration 
between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Advanced Semiconductor 
Engineering, Inc. (ASE). The second year, which is the current year, focus on system 
implementation phase. Surveys to the above project executives were conducted based on the KSFs 
defined in the first year. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was used to analyze the 
feedbacks of these surveys. As a result, weightings were given to KSFs in this hierarchy. 
 
1.2. Purpose 
Implementing supply chain management systems is usually a large and complicate project, 
which involves a large group of people and high requirements of resources. However, the failure 
rates of such projects are high [1, 2]. Furthermore, very few research publications provide an 
overview of the key success factors (KSFs) for implementing a supply chain management IT system. 
This motivates the current research to define and evaluate KSFs for supply chain system 
implementation.  
 
1.3. Expected results 
The resulting comprehensive KSF hierarchy from the first year can serve as a checklist to 
ensure no KSFs were not taken into consideration, which may seriously jeopardize the project. The 
hierarchy may also be a foundation for academic researchers in the field of supply chain system 
integration. In the second years, this research designed survey questionnaire based on the 
hierarchies of KSFs defined in the first year. Surveys and interviews were conduct to managers and 
executives actively participated in the e-supply chain integration project. FAHP were used to

2.2 Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process  
The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) proposed by Saaty [3] shows the process of determining 
the priority of a set of criteria and the relative importance among them in a multi-criteria 
decision-making (MCDM) problem. The primary advantage of AHP is the relative ease with which 
it conducts multiple criteria and performs qualitative and quantitative data [4, 5]. AHP is widely 
used by researchers in a variety of fields in recent years [6]. However, AHP is criticized for its 
inability to reflect human cognitive process because it does not cope with the uncertainty and 
ambiguity existing decision makers‟ judgments [7-10]. It is difficult to respond to the preference of 
decision-makers by assigning crisp number. In order to improve the AHP method, this study 
employs the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and uses triangular fuzzy numbers to express the 
evaluations of decision makers. The essential steps of FAHP are as follows [10, 11] 
 
Step 1: Construct the hierarchical structure 
Establish the hierarchical structure with decision elements, i.e. criteria, and decision makers are 
required to express relative importance of two decision elements in the same level by a nine-point 
scale recommended by Saaty [3]. Then, collect the data and form pair wise comparison matrices for 
each of the K decision makers. 
 
Step 2: Check the consistency 
To ensure that the priority of decision criteria is consistent, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are 
calculated by using Equation 1: 
wwA  max )1(  
Where w is the eigenvector of the matrix A, and max  is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix A. 
Then the consistency index (CI) and the consistency ratio (CR) are defined as Equation 2 and 
Equation 3, respectively [3]:

Where n is the number of criteria being compared in this matrix, and RI is the random index. 
The RI is the average consistency index of randomly generated pairwise comparison matrix of 
similar size, as shown in Table 2 [3].

3.  Results and discussion 
3.1. The dimensions 
 
Table 4 lists the resulting weightings and rankings of the four dimensions, while Table 5 shows 
those for the fifteen factors. The resulting weighting of the four dimensions shows that Strategy is 
by far the highest-weighted dimension with a weighting of 0.5865, which accounts for over half of 
the total weight of one. Further, notice that Strategy is weighted twice more than Process, which is 
the second highest weighted dimension. That indicates that supply chain system implementation is 
truly a strategic project where strategic goals and decisions are of critical importance. Strategy, 
together with process, has a total weighting of 0.8195. That is over 80% of the total weighting. This 
indicates that the success of a supply chain system implementation project relies heavily on 
business and project strategies, as well as the related business processes that support them. 
Technology is the lowest ranked dimension, with a weight of 0.0683. Together with 
Organization, the second lowest ranked dimension, they have a total weighting of 0.1805.

the four dimensions. However, the highest ranking of these five factors is only 9. The research of 
Wu and Barnes [15] pointed out the importance of supply chain partner selection for the success of 
SCM. However, supply chain partner selection has the lowest weighting since this study focus on 
the semiconductor industry, in which partnership relationships, based on strategic alliance, does not 
change very frequently. 
 
3.3. Conclusion 
 
In the first year, this study defines a comprehensive hierarchy of key success factors for 
implementing supply chain management system in semiconductor industry. The defined hierarchy 
can serves as a checklist for future project managers of supply chain implementation projects, 
ensuring that all key success factors will be considered to avoid failure. Based on the hierarchy, this 
research conducted a survey this year and received valid feedback from sixteen managers and 
executives who actively participated in the e-SCM project. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was 
used to analyze the survey results and weight the dimensions and key success factors in the 
hierarchy. Resulting weighting and ranking identified Strategy as the highest-ranking dimension, 
while Top management support and commitment, Clear goals, objectives, and business 
requirements, and Key business process re-engineering are the three most critical success factors. 
Both of the highest-ranking one dimension and the highest-ranking three factors accounts for over 
half of the overall weighting in their level, respectively. These weightings provide SCM project 
executives with a reference for the relative importance of the dimensions and KSFs for the project. 
These weightings also serve as a valuable foundation for decision-making when critical or limited 
project resources must be allocated to resolve issues which are most critical to the success of the 
project. The results of this research can point out the important directions for the continuous 
improvement and future development of SCM systems and can also serve as a foundation for 
academic researchers in related fields.

A Study of Key Success Factors for Supply Chain Management System in 
the Semiconductor 
12 
information systems and management identified the initial 
KSF hierarchies. The second step includes a focus group 
approach to finalize the proposed KSF hierarchies by 
extracting valuable experiences from executives and 
managers who actively participated in a project, which 
successfully establish a seamless SCM integration between 
the world‟s largest semiconductor foundry manufacturing 
company and the world‟s largest assembly and testing 
company. This research compared the resulting KSFs 
between the two phases.  
The proposed hierarchies provides a valuable reference 
for future SCM system project managers, ensuring 
consideration of all key success factors to avoid failure. The 
comparison between the two hierarchies provides valuable 
references for project managers to be awarded of the 
differences in terms of KSFs and management focuses in 
SCM system implementation and operation phases. These 
hierarchies may serve as a foundation for academic research 
in fields related to SCM system implementation and 
operation. 
II. Successful Experience from TSMC and ASE  
The continuing trend of the semiconductor value chain 
disintegration has improved cost efficiency at each stage of 
the value chain. Companies in the value chain need to 
closely collaborate with their partners both upstream and 
downstream in order to meet the relentless end consumer 
demand to achieve shorter time-to-market, lower cost, 
higher responsiveness, and better quality. Therefore, how to 
streamline the business processes between partners, how to 
share information appropriately, and ultimately, how to 
effectively “re-integrate” the value chain in a virtual manner 
have become some of the most critical issues in the 
semiconductor industry today. 
From 1998 to 2004, Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the largest 
semiconductor foundry and second largest IC manufacturing 
company in the world and Advanced Semiconductor 
Engineering Inc. (ASE), the world‟s largest semiconductor 
assembly, testing, and packaging service provider, jointly 
completed an e-Supply Chain Management (eSCM) project 
integrating 11 key business processes through the Internet. 
The result was a seamless interface between TSMC, ASE, 
and their joint customers. The success of this project 
allowed them to obtain accurate, timely information on their 
product status and respond appropriately when needed. 
Their pioneering experience has evolved from a 
two-company project into a potent force, upgrading the 
efficiency of the entire semiconductor industry through 
process and data standardization via RosettaNet
 a
. 
After defining the project architecture, these two 
companies intended to integrate the existing process to build 
a foundation upon which greater process integration and 
data exchange would be established both upstream and 
downstream on the value chain. This model was eventually 
extended to more than 20 of TSMC‟s customers (with 
TSMC as the interface), and to 10 suppliers (with ASE as 
the interface), as Figure 1 shows. The process integration 
and data exchange experiences subsequently became the 
foundation for three RosettaNet standards, RosettaNet 3D8 
(WIP, Work in Process), 7B5/7B6 (Work Order and Work 
Order Acknowledgement), in the semiconductor 
manufacturing (SM) council. 
a
 RosettaNet, formed in 1998, is a standards development 
organization, which provides the standardized data 
infrastructure for integrating business processes for 
collaborative commerce. The data standards now defined are 
widely adopted by companies to conduct inter-company 
SCM. The organization has more than 500 world-leading 
organizations joining and working to create, implement and 
promote open e-business standards and services.

III. Literature Review  
A. System Implementation and System Operation 
Phase in SCM  
Certain researches discussed KSFs in IT system 
implementation phases or in operation phases. Few 
literatures are available identifying KSFs for these two 
phases separately and discussing the differences and 
similarities among these KSFs.  
Ho, and Lin [6] propose a four phases life cycle to 
explain the information system implementation process: 
Design, Test, Realize, and Improve. Among them, Improve 
represent the phase after information system is allowed to 
go-live and run in operation mode. During this phase debugs 
are done and system performance is monitored and tuned. 
Problem areas are identified and resolved as the system is

 Are these KSF hierarchies for SCM system 
implementation and operation a comprehensive one? 
Six focus group discussions were conducted. All these 
discussions were held with six to eight participants from 
both industry and academia. While the same moderator 
facilitated each discussion, the participants were carefully 
selected to have different opinions, in compliance with the 
guidelines of homogeneity and heterogeneity. The following 
table is a summary of the composition of the participants for 
the six focus group discussions (TABLE I.).

3) Proposed KSF Hierarchies for SCM Implementation 
and Operation in Semiconductor Industry  
The results of the focus group discussions are the two 
comprehensive hierarchies of KSFs for SCM 
implementation and operation phases shown in Figure 2 and 
Figure 3. These two KSF hierarchies both include three 
levels: objective, dimensions, and key success factors. The 
reference numbers following the factors represent the 
reference literatures which the factor was originally been 
discussed. The relative importance of the dimensions and 
factors is not represented by the number of factors under it, 
nor by the number of reference in which it was discussed. 
The KSF hierarchy in implementation phase consists of four 
dimensions: Strategy, Process, Organization, and Technical. 
Fifteen KSFs divide between these four dimensions. In 
operation phase, the hierarchy consists of four dimensions: 
Strategy, Process, Partnership, and Technical. Thirteen KSFs 
divide between these four dimensions. 
V. Comparing KSFs in SCM Implementation and 
Operation Phase 
A. Dimension 
Both hierarchies consist of four dimensions, out of 
which three are in common: Strategy, Process, and 
Technical. That indicates SCM IT project is truly a strategic 
level project to support critical business process, and that 
was done by adopting advanced IT technologies [15].The 
organization dimension in implementation phase was 
replaced by partnership dimension in operation phase. This 
indicates the organizational and structural focuses of SCM 
projects are significantly different from implementation 
phase to operation phase. In implementation phase, it is 
critical to form a competent project team which involves all 
stakeholders [16]. Unimpeded cross-organizational 
communication is another important organizational focus to 
ensure the successful implementation of the SCM system 
[17]. After the system go-live and project transform into 
operation phase, the focus shifts to improve collaboration 
with supply chain partners for mutual benefit and develop 
trust-based alliance [9]. If companies‟ structures and 
organizations do not change quickly enough to support 
collaborative behavior required for operation, they will be 
punished by short-term, financially oriented performance 
measures [18]. 
B. Key Success Factor 
There are fifteen KSFs in SCM system implementation 
phase and thirteen KSFs in SCM system operation phase. 
Seven of these KSFs appear in both phase: Policies and 
regulations, Joint agreement on performance and value 
evaluation, Process to ensure interdepartmental cooperation, 
Supply chain partner selection, Direct cross-organizational 
communication for collaboration, Data quality and 
information transparency in SCM and Process and data 
exchange standardization. Those KSFs can be considered as 
more fundamental for SCM system projects and need to be 
well addressed to insure the success of the project in both 
implementation and operation phase.

文題目 
A Study of Key Success Factors for Supply Chain Management System in 
the Semiconductor 
Research Objective and Approach 
Motivated by the above, the current research attempt to 
identify two hierarchies of KSFs for SCM systems 
implementation and operation phases respectively in the 
semiconductor industry. This research uses a two-step 
approach to construct the proposed hierarchies. First, the 
literature review of SCM, operation management, and 
information systems and management identified the initial 
KSF hierarchies. The second step includes a focus group 
approach to finalize the proposed KSF hierarchies by 
extracting valuable experiences from executives and 
managers who actively participated in a project, which 
successfully establish a seamless SCM integration between 
 he world‟  l rge    emi ond   or fo ndry m n f    ring 
 omp ny  nd  he world‟  l rge      em ly  nd  e  ing 
company. This research compared the resulting KSFs 
between the two phases.  
The proposed hierarchies provides a valuable reference 
for future SCM system project managers, ensuring 
consideration of all key success factors to avoid failure. The 
comparison between the two hierarchies provides valuable 
references for project managers to be awarded of the 
differences in terms of KSFs and management focuses in 
SCM system implementation and operation phases. These 
hierarchies may serve as a foundation for academic research 
in fields related to SCM system implementation and 
operation. 
II. SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE FROM TSMC AND ASE  
The continuing trend of the semiconductor value chain 
disintegration has improved cost efficiency at each stage of 
the value chain. Companies in the value chain need to 
closely collaborate with their partners both upstream and 
downstream in order to meet the relentless end consumer 
demand to achieve shorter time-to-market, lower cost, 
higher responsiveness, and better quality. Therefore, how to 
streamline the business processes between partners, how to 
share information appropriately, and ultimately, how to 
effe  ively “re-integra e”  he v l e  h in in   vir   l m nner 
have become some of the most critical issues in the 
semiconductor industry today. 
From 1998 to 2004, Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the largest 
semiconductor foundry and second largest IC manufacturing 
company in the world and Advanced Semiconductor 
Engineering In   (ASE),  he world‟  l rge    emi ond   or 
assembly, testing, and packaging service provider, jointly 
completed an e-Supply Chain Management (eSCM) project 
integrating 11 key business processes through the Internet. 
The result was a seamless interface between TSMC, ASE, 
and their joint customers. The success of this project 
allowed them to obtain accurate, timely information on their 
product status and respond appropriately when needed. 
Their pioneering experience has evolved from a 
two-company project into a potent force, upgrading the 
efficiency of the entire semiconductor industry through 
process and data standardization via RosettaNet a. 
After defining the project architecture, these two 
companies intended to integrate the existing process to build 
a foundation upon which greater process integration and 
data exchange would be established both upstream and 
downstream on the value chain. This model was eventually 
extended to more than 20 of TSMC‟      omer  (wi h 
TSMC as the interface), and to 10 suppliers (with ASE as 
the interface), as Figure 1 shows. The process integration 
and data exchange experiences subsequently became the 
foundation for three RosettaNet standards, RosettaNet 3D8 
(WIP, Work in Process), 7B5/7B6 (Work Order and Work 
Order Acknowledgement), in the semiconductor 
manufacturing (SM) council. 
a RosettaNet, formed in 1998, is a standards development 
organization, which provides the standardized data 
infrastructure for integrating business processes for 
collaborative commerce. The data standards now defined are 
widely adopted by companies to conduct inter-company 
SCM. The organization has more than 500 world-leading 
organizations joining and working to create, implement and 
promote open e-business standards and services.

III. LITERATURE REVIEW  
A. System Implementation and System Operation Phase in 
SCM  
Certain researches discussed KSFs in IT system 
implementation phases or in operation phases. Few 
literatures are available identifying KSFs for these two 
 
KSF hierarchies for SCM system implementation phase and 
operation phase respectively. The following five questions 
were asked in each of the focus group discussion sessions to 
ensure that expected results are obtained: 
 Which KSFs do you think are appropriate for SCM 
system implementation and operation in the 
semiconductor industry? 
 Which dimensions do you think are appropriate for 
SCM system implementation and operation in the 
semiconductor industry? 
 Which KSFs and which dimensions can be 
consolidated? 
 Which KSFs should be put under which dimension? 
 Are these KSF hierarchies for SCM system 
implementation and operation a comprehensive one? 
Six focus group discussions were conducted. All these 
discussions were held with six to eight participants from 
both industry and academia. While the same moderator 
facilitated each discussion, the participants were carefully 
selected to have different opinions, in compliance with the 
guidelines of homogeneity and heterogeneity. The following 
table is a summary of the composition of the participants for 
the six focus group discussions (TABLE I.).

3) Proposed KSF Hierarchies for SCM Implementation 
and Operation in Semiconductor Industry  
The results of the focus group discussions are the two 
comprehensive hierarchies of KSFs for SCM 
implementation and operation phases shown in Figure 2 and 
Figure 3. These two KSF hierarchies both include three 
levels: objective, dimensions, and key success factors. The 
reference numbers following the factors represent the 
reference literatures which the factor was originally been 
discussed. The relative importance of the dimensions and 
factors is not represented by the number of factors under it, 
nor by the number of reference in which it was discussed. 
The KSF hierarchy in implementation phase consists of four 
dimensions: Strategy, Process, Organization, and Technical. 
Fifteen KSFs divide between these four dimensions. In 
operation phase, the hierarchy consists of four dimensions: 
Strategy, Process, Partnership, and Technical. Thirteen KSFs 
divide between these four dimensions. 
V. COMPARING KSFS IN SCM IMPLEMENTATION AND 
OPERATION PHASE 
A. Dimension 
Both hierarchies consist of four dimensions, out of 
which three are in common: Strategy, Process, and 
Technical. That indicates SCM IT project is truly a strategic 
level project to support critical business process, and that 
was done by adopting advanced IT technologies [15].The 
organization dimension in implementation phase was 
replaced by partnership dimension in operation phase. This 
indicates the organizational and structural focuses of SCM 
projects are significantly different from implementation 
phase to operation phase. In implementation phase, it is 
critical to form a competent project team which involves all 
stakeholders [16]. Unimpeded cross-organizational 
communication is another important organizational focus to 
ensure the successful implementation of the SCM system 
[17]. After the system go-live and project transform into 
operation phase, the focus shifts to improve collaboration 
with supply chain partners for mutual benefit and develop 
trust-   ed  lli n e [9]  If  omp nie ‟   r    re   nd 
organizations do not change quickly enough to support 
collaborative behavior required for operation, they will be 
punished by short-term, financially oriented performance 
measures [18]. 
B. Key Success Factor 
There are fifteen KSFs in SCM system implementation 
phase and thirteen KSFs in SCM system operation phase. 
Seven of these KSFs appear in both phase: Policies and 
regulations, Joint agreement on performance and value 
evaluation, Process to ensure interdepartmental cooperation, 
Supply chain partner selection, Direct cross-organizational 
communication for collaboration, Data quality and 
information transparency in SCM and Process and data 
exchange standardization. Those KSFs can be considered as 
more fundamental for SCM system projects and need to be 
well addressed to insure the success of the project in both 
implementation and operation phase.
