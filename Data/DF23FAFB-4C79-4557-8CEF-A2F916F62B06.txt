報告內容 
前言 
 三維積體電路近期重新再被注意，被認為是下世代系統的一個重要解決方案，其好處可以減少晶
片面積，高性能 [1]， [2] 、高密度、耗電量與成本更低 [3] 及異質整合等特點，圖一展示了三維積
體電路中從處理器到異質整合的應用 [4] 。在多種不同的三維堆疊方法中 [5] ，直通矽穿孔（穿過矽
晶圓的通孔）技術在連接性能、設計費用及製造成本上具有強大的吸引力 [6] ，因此本計劃專注於開
發以直通矽穿孔為技術利用多層晶片堆疊的三維積體電路研究

同位置對應的熱效應，如圖 5(b)所示為兩個不同熱效應分佈的晶片堆疊對應圖，其面積分別劃分成九
個熱效應區域，若其高溫度區域(紅色區域)對齊於不同的垂直位置，則最差的熱效應在此電路中將被抑
制，如圖 5(c)的三角形所示；另一方面來看，若其高溫度區域(紅色區域)對齊於相同的垂直位置，則此
堆疊的區域將會產生最差的熱效應，如圖 5(c)的正方形所示。因此在三維積體電路中熱效應的影響不
僅和時間有關，不同層與不同位置都有影響。此結果將使三維晶片系統的各種元件遭受不同的熱效應，
造成晶片漏電電流、可靠性等問題複雜化，電路性能因此降低。

中不同層數與不同熱效應 堆疊造成的溫度變化 
 
熱效應對於動態隨機存取記憶體儲存的資料有重大的影響。動態隨機存取記憶體的記憶胞是由一顆電
晶體與一顆電容組成，理想上若電晶體關閉，電容的資料可以長久完整保存；但實際上電晶體關閉時
仍有漏電流通過，且電容也有漏電流，電容儲存的資料因漏電流流失。其漏電流受溫度的影響甚大，
當高溫時漏電流急遽上升，資料保存時間不易，如圖 6 所示為不同溫度下資料流失的速度。 
積體電路之製程技術從早期 0.18um 進展至 40nm，進步的同時電路特性卻相對變差，並且製程變化差
異甚大，如圖 7 所示為不同晶圓與不同晶片的差異。以直通矽穿孔為技術的三維積體電路因多層堆疊
不同晶片使得直通矽穿孔的負載差異，無法預估頂層與底層的延遲時間，若速度太快將會導致訊號衰
減甚至傳遞錯誤；若速度太慢將會導致消耗功率太大。傳統設計的概念是為了在最差的情況下維持正
常功能，因此降低速度增加功率消耗。若多層堆疊其直通矽穿孔的延遲時間將會是一個關鍵的議題。

 為了解決直通矽穿孔因負載不同引起功耗過高或速度過快導致錯誤，或因多層堆疊引起不可預期
的問題，使三維靜態隨機存取記憶體的資料正確傳遞，並且在維持正常功能的情況下降低功率增加速

研究方法 
 我們專注於開發漏電流控制電路、差動直通矽穿孔電路與溫度察覺自我刷新控制電路，熱警覺漏
電流控制電路會根據不同層、不同位置的三維靜態隨機存取記憶體陣列受溫度的影響動態調整漏電流
抑制電路；差動直通矽穿孔電路會根據直通矽穿孔的負載差異調節感測時間：溫度察覺自我刷新控制
電路會根據溫度動態調節自我刷新週期。 
 以下是我們研究與發展熱警覺漏電流控制電路的步驟： 
第一步驟： 
我們利用90奈米的製程分析靜態隨機存取記憶胞的漏電流，並執行傳統的閘通道接地睡眠電晶體電路
作為參考。此外我們分析不同溫度與虛接地的資料保存電壓。  
第二步驟： 
我們發展區域性熱監視電路以偵測靜態隨機存取記憶體，此電路的目標是為了防止使用傳統類比熱監
視電路，因為傳統類比熱監視電路會消耗直流電流並引起系統待命電流的增加。  
第三步驟： 
我們針對三維靜態隨機存取記憶體陣列發展漏電流控制電路，此電路會根據位置、時間及溫度的變動

serial access-gates. Cross-point (CP) cells suffer from degraded
writability due to their serial access-gates. Hence, the CP cells
require an additional write assist circuit to compensate for weak
writability. The 6T with self-WB [6] reduces the probability of
disturb failure but fails to completely solve half-select disturb
issues. A failure may still occur before the self-WB sense am-
plifier is activated.
Previous low VDDmin SRAMs suffered from many obvious
drawbacks such as large area, slow read sensing, weak write
margins, imperfect layout patterns, and half-selected solutions
for low VDD applications. It would be safe to say that the ul-
timate cell would require a “decoupled faster differential read
first and write back” without an increase in cell area, compared
with DS8T, which was previously recognized as the most area
efficient cell at large .
A Japanese patent [25] disclosed the schematic diagram of the
2T differential decoupled read-port resistor-load-type SRAM in
1993. However, 1) the concrete and feasible cell layout, 2) the
applicable read/write margin-expanding peripheral circuit and
3) the variation tolerance and area-efficiency study under large
conditions for the 2T decoupled differential read-
port based SRAM cell have never been discussed before. In this
paper, we propose a new compact z-shape cell layout [26] to pri-
oritize symmetric device placement while providing high area
efficiency. This paper demonstrates quantitative performance
advantages of a zigzag 8T-SRAM (Z8T) cell over the decou-
pled single-ended sensing 8T-SRAM (DS8T) with write-back
schemes, which was previously recognized as the most area-effi-
cient cell under large conditions. The Z8T SRAM
macro combines a differential decoupled read scheme with a
differential write-back sense amplifier (DRWB-SA) to achieve
fast read and write-back speed and lower VDDmin compared to
previous 8T/10T cells.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the operation of the proposed Z8T SRAM cell and
layout. Section III presents its macro structure and implemen-
tation. Section IV analyzes the performance and compares it to
the performance of other SRAMs. Section V presents the results
of the experiments. Section VI summarizes our conclusions.
II. THE ZIGZAG 8T (Z8T) SRAM CELL
Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic of the Z8T cell. The Z8T cell
comprises a standard 6T cell and a 2T decoupled differential
read-port (D RP), decoded by a virtual logic-swing read-word-
line (RWL). Two decoupled read-port transistors (2T), NR0 and
NR1, are used to transfer the storage data (Q and QB) to the
read bitline (RBL, RBLB). Because the storage nodes and RBL/
RBLB are isolated by NR0 and NR1, the storage nodes (Q and
QB) are entirely decoupled from RBL and RBLB, and read
static noise margins are similar to hold static noise margin. The
decoupled differential read port solves the read disturb issue,
as well as enabling differential read operation employing small
swing high speed sensing.
Fig. 1(b) shows the circuits of previous differential read
9T (D9T) [20] and a mini-array of the 8T cell derived from
D9T. Cell-00 stores data 1 and all unse-
lected cells on column-0 and all cells in column-1 store data 0
. When the selected RWL[0] is active (high)
and the unselected RWLs (RWL[1]–RWL[n]) are inactive
(low), both RBLB[0] and RBL[1] are pulled down by the active
cells (cell-00 and cell-01). If the voltage swing on RBL[1] ex-
ceeds the of NR1, then the virtual ground lines (VGL) of
unselected rows will be discharged by the RBL[1]. The RBL[0]
is discharged by the NR1 of unselected cells on column-0. Due
to both RBL and RBLB being pulled down, sensing failure
occurs. By using the RWL switch in each cell, the D9T cell
prevents the data-pattern dependent data collision issue.
In this Z8T design, the RWL of the selected row is pulled to
VSS and RWLs remain VDD for the unselected rows during
a read operation. The full swing control allows the RWL to
be shared across columns without any data collisions between
columns. Thus, the VDD-driven unselected RWL eliminates the
need for extra switches as in previous decoupled RP and enables
D RP with only 2T. Differential sensing reduces the read BL
(RBL) swing , which also helps to avoid data collisions
between columns. The Z8T cell has better read static noise mar-
gins to the equivalent of hold SNM of conventional 6T SRAM.
The Z8T-SRAM also has a faster read speed for long bitline ap-
plications due to its small swing differential read sensing.
The Z8T cell operations are described below. In hold mode,
all BLs are precharged to high and the write-WL (WWL) is kept
low. The RWL is held at VDD to turn off the D RP because
the gate-source voltage difference of NR0/NR1 does not
exceed zero.
A. Read Operation
Prior to the read operation, the RWL remains at VDD and the
RBL and RBLB is initially precharged to the VDD. During the
read operation, the RWL is given a low pulse and pulled to the
VSS. If the storage node Q stores a low voltage, the NR0 will
remain off and the RBLB will remain at VDD during the read
operation. In this case, where the storage node QB stores a high
voltage, the nMOS transistor NR1 is turned on, and the RBL
will be pulled low. A small voltage difference between
the RBL and RBLB will be developed and can be sensed by the
differential sense amplifier. On the other hand, if the storage
nodes Q and QB store high and low voltage, respectively, the
RBLB will remain at the VDD, and the RBLB will be pulled
down to low.
For unselected rows, RWLs are driven at VDD, which plays
a role as the BL is clamped through unselected NR0 and NR1
transistors, once on RBL exceeds a certain level.
In the read mode, a short RWL pulse limits the RBL/RBLB
voltage swing within 60 mV to 100 mV. The replica-
column scheme [29]–[33] is used in Z8T SRAM to control the
word-line pulsewidth and sense-amplifier enable time during a
read operation. When an unselected cell stores data “1”
, the gate and drain terminals of NR0
are biased at VDD, while the source of NR0 is biased at VDD-
. As a result, the of NR0 in an unselected cell is
equal to , which is much smaller than the (with
body effect) of NR0. Thus, the read-ports of unselected cells
are biased at the cut-off region as long as the swing is
less than 100 mV regardless of the data patterns. Since the BL
leakage is suppressed by the VDD driven D RP, the Z8T can

uses write enhanced transistor ratio designs to achieve larger
write margins.
C. Zigzag Cell Layout
Fig. 2(a) shows the single cell layout of the Z8T cell. The
cross-coupled inverter latches with two write pass transistors
PG0 and PG1 (6T), which have the same layout placement as in
a conventional 6T SRAM cell. The poly gate of NR0 and NR1
are directly extended from the nMOS gates of the two inverters.
Therefore, extra poly to contact spacing for connecting in the
X-direction of the DS8T layout is not required.
Fig. 2(b) shows the layout of Z8T cell compared to the DS8T
cell. Instead of using a conventional rectangular shape, this Z8T
cell uses a zigzag shape [26] to prioritize symmetric device
placement while providing high area efficiency. The cell uses
a 2-poly pitch, as in 6T and DS8T cells, to prevent large dead
spaces as in the CP10T/8T cells. NR0 and NR1 of the 2T D RP
are placed separately at the upper left and bottom right of the 6T
(giving it the zigzag appearance). The Z8T cell is compact and
only 1.34x the area of a 6T cell.
An array is also illustrated in Fig. 2(b) and demonstrates how
the Z8T cell is integrated to become an SRAM array. Each ad-
jacent cell is slotted together in a single row meaning that the
RWL node of neighboring columns can be shared in order to
save array area. The RBLB node of NR0 can be shared with the
neighboring cell above and the RBL node of NR1 can be shared
with neighboring cell below. The RBL and RBLB nodes can
be shared by adjacent rows because each row of the cell is then
mirrored as the next row.
It should be noted that DS8T SRAM layout suffers from
asymmetric device placement that could potentially degrade
its SNM and write-ability [22]. This is because the right side
of the cross-coupled inverter sees two stacked transistors (2T
read-port), but the left side of the cross-coupled inverter does
not. The asymmetrical layout induces lithographic variation
between the two cross-coupled latches.
III. MACRO IMPLEMENTATION
A. Macro Structure
Fig. 3(a) shows a block diagram of the Z8T SRAM macro.
RWLs are activated both for read and write operations. The
WWL is activated after the RWL cycle during a write opera-
tion and is not activated during the read operation.
The cell current simultaneously sinking across columns
causes an IR drop and ground bounce on the selected RWL,
degrading RBL access speed. To reduce the RWL driver size
and prevent speed degradation due to RWL ground bounce,
this work employs a segmented structure for the read word-line
(RWL). Two metal layers are used for RWL signals, metal-5
layer for the global RWL (GRWL), and a metal-3 layer for the
local RWL (LRWL). The GRWL is connected to the LRWL
buffers. There are only 64 cells on a LRWL in this work. The
GRWL requires a small-size driver, thanks to its light loading.
The LRWL buffer is placed at the center of a cell array.
The function of DRWB-SA for the Z8T SRAM combines dif-
ferential read sense amplifier and differential write drivers with
Y-MUX and WB. Compared to a 6T SRAM macro, the area
penalty of SA is only 3% compared to the read/write block in a
U6T macro, but the VDDmin and speed performance is signifi-
cantly improved.
The Z8T cell uses three metal layers for the cell structure and
the fourth metal layer for power meshing and routing blockage,
which is the same as in a conventional 6T macro. In addition,
in order to implement the segmented RWL structure for the
area/speed optimization, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the Z8T macro
employs the fifth layer for GRWL/LRWL routing and power
meshing as well. Thus, the fifth metal-layer usage is the result of
design trade-off between cost and area-saving/speed optimiza-
tion.
B. Differential Read and Write-Back Sense Amplifier
(DRWB-SA)
Differential read and write-back sense amplifiers
(DRWB-SA) are placed at the bottom of each column. They
are connected directly to the RBL/RBLB and WBL/WBLB to
perform read sensing only for read and write operations for
the selected columns; and a differential read with subsequent
write-back for the unselected columns. To perform the read
first and write-back procedure during the write cycle, the read
word-line is also activated, even during the write cycle. The
column decoder MUX output buffer is in the last stage of the
data sense amplifier. Compared with the previous single-ended
sensing DS8T with a WB scheme, Z8T can provide much faster
secure read-first and WB operation, thanks to the differential
sensing by using a differential read and write-back sense
amplifier (DRWB-SA).
The DRWB-SA comprises one pair of read control lines (RS)
and complementary write control lines (WS/WSB) for control
of the read and write, respectively. Fig. 3(a) shows a block di-
agram and data path of the DRWB-SA for read and write op-
erations. The truth table of the switch control signals (RS and
WS/WSB) is listed in Table I.
Fig. 4(a) depicts a schematic of the proposed DRWB-SA.

waveform of the DRWB-SA.
In advanced technologies, the unidirectional poly rule has been
recommended as a process design rule. The unidirectional poly
rule and one-column pitch layout limits the SA devices place-
ment and increases SA offset. Fig. 5 shows the interleaving
placement of the DRWB-SA, which can be divided into two
major blocks, the write bitline buffer (WBUF) and the sensing
circuit (SA) block. In this work, the WBUF is placed in a one-
column pitch and the width of SA latch block is laid out in two-
column pitch, rather than a one-column pitch. The two-column
pitch allows the SA to use a common-centroid layout style and a
larger transistor width to suppress the device mismatch. The in-
terleaving 2-pitch SA layout style enables an SA offset voltage
within 1-sigma 10 mV according to our statistical simulation.

IV. PERFORMANCE AND COMPARISON
The cell area of a Z8T cell and a read decoupled 8T SRAM
are approximately the same 1.34x the size of an aggressive-rule
6T cell. But the small swing differential sensing scheme of Z8T
has both speed and area advantages over single-ended sensing.
The layout of the write-back sense amplifier per column occu-
pies about 2% area penalty compared to single-ended 8T SRAM
based on the same bitline length. But actually, the area effi-
ciency of singled-ended 8T SRAM is worse due to divided bit-
line and associated peripheral circuits. Compared to DS8T cell,
the macro area of a 32 Kb Z8 SRAM is 14% smaller than that
of DS8T macro (with divided-BL). Fig. 6 shows the VDDmin
trend as a function of for various SRAM cells based on
the following assumptions: 1) the same area of a CP10T cell
(2.02x the area of a conventional 6T cell) and 2) the read sta-
bility preferred cell design (i.e., write margin is always the lim-
iter). The reasons why the write margin is always the limiter is
assumed in this analysis are as follows. 1) The read-decoupled
Z8T with write-back scheme and a CP10T never suffer from
the half-select issue (i.e., read stability issue), resulting in no
limitation caused by the read SNM (i.e., write margin is always
limiter). 2) On the other hand, other SRAM cells have potential
limiters for both read stability and write margins. Thus, in order
to make simple comparisons while keeping the same assump-
tions, the read stability preferred cell design is assumed. As a
result, each device size is assumed as shown in Table II. Both
CP10T and D10T cells have smaller space for upsizing the PG
transistors compared to DS8T and Z8T due to the larger number
of transistors in a cell. Consequently, since all the cells in this
analysis are limited by write failure, the dependency for
VDDmin follows a similar trend across all cells The VDDmin
of each macro are chosen for coverage. Clearly, Z8T is the
best in area efficiency for larger .
As mentioned earlier, this work segmented the RWL to sup-
press the speed degradation due to RWL ground bounce. Fig. 7
shows the normalized macro read time across various LRWL
lengths (number of cells per LRWL) of a 32 Kb SRAM macro

In this work, the Z8T SRAM macro has 256 cells for each bit-
line. When all the cells in the same column store data 1 ,
the worst-case (maximum) BL clamp current occurs and causes
a smaller . The maximum (bitline swing) is af-
fected by the data pattern on a column. In this paper, the worst-
case condition (256 cells store ) has been considered
for the macro-level statistical analysis. As shown in Fig. 9(a), if
is 60 mV and 100 mV at V, the BL clamping
current from the VDD-driven unselected 255 RWLs is smaller
than 0.12% and 0.53% of the read cell current, respectively.
Fig. 9(b) shows the distribution of NR0 and NR1. Since
the ( % of VDD, also the of NR0 if ) is
much smaller than the increased of NR0s due to the body
effect, all D RPs of unselected cells are operated in the cut-off
region. Fig. 9(c) shows the normalized current consumption in
a read operation versus . The Z8T SRAM consumes a
smaller read power than that of DS8T due to smaller BL swing.
The read power in a DS8T SRAM is larger than that of the

Z8T SRAM due to half-VDD swing for logic gate sensing. The
clamping current of the Z8T SRAM can be neglected as long as
the below 300 mV for the employed 65 nm process.
Fig. 10(a) shows the failure tolerance Z of the SA with dif-
ferent SA offset variation. Since the 32 Kb macro has 128 sense
amplifiers, the failure probability sigma Z required is at least
2.4 for this case. In this work, the Z-number can achieve 4
(32 K-SA) at V. It is large enough to cover most
of design. If using a high-K metal gate process [27], thanks to
the reduced variation, the failure probability sigma Z can
be increased from 4 to 5.7 at 0.3 V. Fig. 10(b) shows the write
margin dependency on VDD. The definition of write margin in
this paper is the write BL voltage divided by VDD where the cell
nodes are flipped. The Z8T cell can achieve 5% write margin to
have coverage at V.
B. Write Performance
The simulated cell write time (without pre-read operation)
with local variations for each transistor in an SRAM
cell is shown in Fig. 11(a). It has been normalized to an area
of a CP10T cell which is 2.02x the area of a conventional 6T
cell. The transistor size for Z8T, DS8T, D10T and CP10T are
assumed as shown in Table II. In this simulation, each tran-
sistor had a different randomly assigned variation. The

In this design, the power consumption at the nominal voltage

and a DS8T macro, as shown in Fig. 13(a). The simulated power
consumption at VDDmin (VDDmin-power) for 6T, DS8T and
Z8T is shown in Fig. 13(b). The measured VDDmin of a 64
Kb Z8T macro in 90 nm is 230 mV. The power consumption at
VDDmin (VDDmin-power) of Z8T macro is only 15% of that
of 6T macro (with a V), thanks to its 390 mV
improvement in VDDmin.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A test chip with 32 Kb and 4 Kb macros was fabricated
using a 65 nm low-power (LP) CMOS process. The 4 Kb and
32 Kb macros employed the same decoding, timing control,
and sensing circuits. The 4 Kb macro has 32 cells per BL
and the 32 Kb macro has 256 cells for each BL. In order to
prevent the VDDmin being clamped by IO driving capability,
the chip design for the Z8T macro was separated into two
power domains (VDD M and VDD IO) for testing. Due to

pin-count limitation, several macros shared the same power and
IO pins in the 65 nm test chip. Thus, this experiment cannot
characterize the power consumption and speed performance
for the 65 nm macros. Another 64 Kb Z8T SRAM macro was
fabricated with 90 nm CMOS technology for VDDmin, speed
and power characterization. Fig. 14 shows the die photos of
these three macros.

shows the frequency shmoo plots of the Z8T 64 Kb macro for a
90 nm process. The measured VDDmin of the 4 Kb Z8T SRAM
was 250 mV and for the 32 Kb Z8T SRAM is 440 mV, which

A 130 mV SRAM With Expanded Write and Read
Margins for Subthreshold Applications
Meng-Fan Chang, Member, IEEE, Shi-Wei Chang, Po-Wei Chou, and Wei-Cheng Wu
Abstract—SRAM suffers read-disturb and write failures at a
low supply voltage, especially at deep subthreshold operation. This
study proposes a 9T-SRAM cell with a data-aware-feedback-cutoff
(DAFC) scheme to enlarge the write margin and dynamic-read-de-
coupled (DRD) scheme to prevent read-disturb for achieving deep
subthreshold operation. A 30 mV negative-pumped wordline
scheme is employed to suppress bitline leakage current. The fab-
ricated 90 nm 32 Kb 9T-SRAM macro achieves 130 mV VDDmin.
All the 32 Kb 9T cells are stable across read and write operations
when operated at 105 mV.
Index Terms—Low supply voltage, SRAM, read disturb, sub-
threshold voltage, write margin.
I. INTRODUCTION
U SING ultra-low supply voltage (VDD) enables sup-pressing power consumption, gate leakage, and standby
current of a chip to lengthen battery life time for low-power
mobile devices [1]–[3]. Some energy-harvesting-based systems
generate low supply voltages. Researchers have considered sub-
threshold operation [4]–[6] as one of the promising low-power
approaches for non-high-speed ultra-low-VDD chips. Due
to increasing threshold voltage fluctuations caused by
global and local process variations, on-chip nanometer SRAMs
suffer from instability in write and read operations at a lower
supply voltage.
Previous studies have developed various read or write assist
methods to enhance the write margin and read stability for 6T
SRAM cells. These schemes include cell-VDD (CVDD) adjust-
ment [7]–[14], cell virtual-ground (CVSS) bias [9], [15]–[17],
differential CVSS [18], boosted [14], [18]–[23] or reduced
wordline (WL) voltage [14], dual-rail supply scheme [8], [14],
[23]–[28], negative bitline (BL) [29]–[31] scheme, and write
back schemes [9], [32], [33]. However, the conventional 6T
cells can only lower the minimum operation voltage (VDDmin)
down to the 0.45 V to 0.7 V range.

A 7T cell [34] achieves read-static-noise-margin-free by cut-
ting off a pull-down path during read operations, but has limited
write capability due to single-end write operations. A read-de-
coupled (RD) 8T cell [18]–[20], [35]–[40], which isolates its
read-port from the storage node, is a popular solution for many
low-VDD chips because of its superior read stability. However,
RD-8T cells do not significantly increase the write margin
(WM), and still suffer from half-select stability failure during a
write operation. Divided wordline schemes prevent disturbance
at half-select cells, but do not solve write failures. Thus, the
RD-8T cell can only achieve 0.26 V–0.45 V VDDmin.
To achieve subthreshold operation, studies have proposed
new cell structures and sizing schemes with larger process
variation coverage than conventional 6T and RD-8T SRAM
cells. Several read-decoupled 9T [41], [42] or 10T SRAM cells
[21], [43]–[46] have achieved subthreshold operation with
excellent read stability, but consume a large area overhead and
have a limited write margin. Upsizing the 6T (U6T) cell using a
larger transistor size improves cell stability, but cannot meet the
requirements for further reducing the VDDmin. The asymmet-
rical 6T SRAM cell [47] improves the write margin using larger
access-transistors, but requires more than 2x the area overhead.
The single-ended 6T SRAM cell [48] solves the on-off ratio
issue for read access to achieve excellent subthreshold opera-
tion, but needs 2x the area overhead and additional write-assist
schemes (CVDD/CVSS) to compensate for the degradation in
write margin. Clearly, these reported SRAM cells still do not
satisfy the needs for improving both read and write stability
with a limited area overhead for subthreshold applications.
This paper proposes a 9T cell to achieve deep subthreshold
operation using a data-aware-feedback-cutoff (DAFC) scheme
to enlarge the write margin and dynamic-read-decoupled
(DRD) schemes to prevent read-disturb. The cell area for the
near-threshold and subthreshold applications are 1.64x and
1.8x of the conventional 6T SRAM cell. Fabricated 90 nm 9T
32 Kb macros confirm that the 9T macro can achieve 130 mV
VDDmin. To our knowledge, this work achieves the lowest
VDDmin compared to reported SRAM designs.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the operations of the proposed 9T SRAM
cell. Section III analyzes the performance of the proposed 9T
cell. Section IV presents the macro structure and experiment
results. Section V draws conclusions.

SRAM cells if using the same transistor sizes in cross-couple
inverters and access transistors.
B. Dynamic Read-Decoupled (DRD) Scheme
In a read operation, NSR of the accessed 9T SRAM cell is
turned off by grounding SCR. When the RWL rises, the RPG
and PDR form a single-end read port, while the NQB node of the
read-port is temporarily decoupled from the QB node since the
NSR is off and this dynamic read-decoupled behavior prevents
the voltage bump at node NQB from passing to node QB, thus
improving the read stability.
In addition, the SCL is pulled to ground during the BL access
period in a read operation. If SCL remains high during the read
operation, the node Q remains at VDD by PUL while the PDL
is turned off by QB to achieve good cell stability for a read-1
operation. However, in a read-0 operation with SCL kept high,
the QB node floats, because NSR is off, while node Q is con-
nected to a potential discharge driver (PDL). This makes the
9T cell sensitive to positive noise on node QB and causes it to
have poor cell stability. Fig. 3 compares the cell stability of two
cases of SCL control. Case 1 represents the SCR kept at ground
during the RWL active period. Case 2 represents the SCR kept
at VDD in read operation. By pulling down the SCL (case-2),
the subthreshold current flow through the NSL is reduced expo-
nentially. Thus, node Q is isolated from the PDL and the read
stability is improved compared to keeping SCL at VDD.
C. Column Half-Selected Cells
Although using the divided wordline structure prevents the
half-select disturbance issue on the accessed row, there are half-
selected cells on the accessed columns due to SCR/SCL tog-
gling for the proposed 9T cell. For the column half-selected
cells, the store-1 nodes still have constant driving by the pull-up
(PUL or PUR) devices during the SCR/SCL pull-down period.
In a write operation, the store-0 node of a column half-se-
lected cell floats when its data is opposite to the to-be-written
data. This gives the worst-case cell stability for a write oper-
ation, as Fig. 4 shows. Fortunately, the NSR/NSL off time is
short since the 9T cell has fast write time, as will be shown in
Section III.
In a read operation, all store-0 nodes of the column half-se-
lected cells float during the SCR/SCL pull-down period.
The leakage current of the turned-off NSL/NSR devices
weakly drives these floating 0-nodes. Moreover, the column
half-selected cells have the negative coupling noise caused by
NSL/NSR pulling down behavior. This negative coupling noise

cells. Fig. 7 shows the normalized cell area across various
threshold voltage variations ( - ) for a target write margin
at V. Though - should be different for
transistors in a SRAM cell, to simplify the analysis, this work
uses the same - for all transistors in a SRAM cell. The
target write margin is the write margin of the proposed 9T cell
at for - mV. Clearly, the proposed
9T cell requires less area than other cells, especially for the
process with large - . In other words, the proposed 9T
cell tolerates a wider variation within the same area and
write-margin constraints.
Fig. 8(a) shows the simulated waveforms in a write opera-
tion for the proposed 9T and conventional 6T at V
with an example case of a device mismatch condition. Clearly,
the proposed 9T achieves a faster write time than the conven-
tional 6T. Fig. 8(b) compares the write times of 90 nm SRAM
cells. This analysis only compares the mean write-time due to
different cells having various VDDmin for write operation. The
proposed 9T cell not only has the largest write margin, but the
fastest write time across various supply voltages.
B. Read Stability
Fig. 9 compares the read stability at of
90 nm SRAM cells. There is no consensus on the accurate metric
for dynamic cell stability; this paper employs the commonly
used read-SNM to evaluate dynamic cell stability. Thanks to
the pseudo read-decoupled mechanism, the proposed 9T cell
improves the mean read-SNM by 4.1x, compared to the U6T
cells at V. With enlarged read-SNM, the proposed
9T cell achieves similar read-VDDmin to the read-decoupled
cells (i.e., RD-8T cell) and achieves lower VDDmin than other
non-read-decoupled cells.
C. Stability of Column Half-Selected Cells
Fig. 10 shows the floating-mode data-retention-time (FM-
DRT) for the proposed 90 nm 9T cell operating at read and
write-modes. The FM-DRT of the write mode
at V is 21x longer than the required write time.
The FM-DRT of the read mode at V is 1.7x longer
than the required RWL pulsewidth for . The
write-mode FM-DRT is notably shorter than that of the read-

mode because the proposed 9T cell suffers an imbalanced feed-
back loop at the write mode (with only one NMOS-switch is
on), while both NSWR and NSWL are off at the read mode.
Compared to another low-VDD SRAM cell with floating-nodes,
the data-aware differential power-supplied 8T (D AP-8T) cell
[52], the FM-DRT of the proposed 9T cell is longer than that of
the D AP-8T cell. This is because the discharging leakage cur-
rent of the off-state nMOS switch helps to keep the floating-
node (store-0 node) in the proposed 9T cell back at its orig-
inal state. Oppositely, the discharging leakage current of the
off-state pMOS switch, generated by the grounded differential
virtual-CVDD, increases the data-loss rate at the floating node
(store-1 node) in the D AP-8T cell. Thus, the floating-nodes of
column half-selected cells does not cause data loss.
IV. MACRO IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Macro Implementation
In the subthreshold operation, the on-off current ratio of
a MOS transistor reduces as the VDD decreases. Since the
read-bitline (RBL) charging current of a bitline keeper (PMOS)
cannot exceed the cell current , a reduced on-off current

and column selection signals (decoded from the input address).
To reduce area overhead, pass-transistors are used to connect be-
tween local and global signals, instead of using tri-state buffers.
The area overhead created by these divided blocks for a 32 Kb
9T macro is less than 7%, compared to the design without di-
vided blocks. Nevertheless, the 32 Kb 9T macro still achieves a
10–16% smaller macro area than that of previous subthreshold
32 Kb 10 T SRAM macros using the same technology.
B. Experimental Results
This study implemented a testchip with a 32 Kb 9T-SRAM
macro using an industrial 90nm bulk CMOS process. Fig. 13
shows the die photo and the schematic of this testchip. The
chip access time/delay includes the access time
of the embedded SRAM macro and the path delay
. The comprises the delay of on-chip
wiring , of the input and output pads , and
of the wiring on the load-board . Equations (1) and (2)

derive the relationships among these delays. To extract the
of the SRAM macro, this study implemented a dummy path for
the measurement.

This investigation performed a shmoo test for the 9T 32Kb
testchip across various supply voltages for the SRAM macro
(VDD M) and operation frequency, as Fig. 14 presents. The 9T
32 Kb macro is functional from 0.5 V to 130 mV. Between
130 mV and 120 mV, the failure bit count is less than 20 bits.
At 100 mV, the failure bit count is less than 100 bits.
An additional measurement was performed to determine the
(main) cause of the failure bits between 130 mV
100 mV. A high-voltage read operation was performed after a
low-voltage write or after a low-voltage-read. The experiment
confirmed that the failure bits between 130 mV 105 mV in
the shmoo test are due to on-off ratio induced sensing
failure, not because of write or cell stability failure. This is be-
cause the bitline leakage current causes the read-0 (RBL kept
high) sensing failure when the RWL period is long and BL
keeper is weak at a low VDD. With a shorter bitline length,

Abstract—Capable of only solving the READ-stability is-
sue, many 8T–10T static RAM (SRAM) cells require extra
WRITE-assist circuits to achieve low supply voltage operation. This
brief proposes a novel 10T SRAM cell and a hybrid-divided-block
array to enhance the READ-and-WRITE stability while achieving a
higher operating speed with a smaller area overhead for sub-0.5 V
applications. A 16-Kb 128-row 10T flowthrough SRAM macro is
fabricated using a 90-nm bulk-CMOS process. The 10T cell area
is only 1.7 times the size of a 6T cell. The measured VDDmin for
the 10T 16-Kb macro is 240 mV. The proposed 16-Kb macro can
achieve 300-MHz random access operation at 0.45 V for a 0.5 V
system platform.

I. INTRODUCTION
MANY low-power mobile chips utilize a low supply volt-age (VDD) to suppress dynamic- and leakage-power
consumption to extend battery lifetime. A 0.5 V VDD [1] has
been considered as a promising platform for next-generation
low-power mobile devices. However, below the 0.5 V VDD, on-
chip nanometer static RAMs (SRAMs) are inhibited by WRITE-
failure and READ-disturbance restrictions [2]–[4], as attributed
to increasing threshold voltage VTH fluctuations created by
process variations. Moreover, the speed performance is still of
priority concern in many low-power chips, necessitating the
development of a sub-0.5 V high-speed SRAM solution.
Various assist methods [5]–[11] are developed to enhance the
WRITE margin (WM) and the READ stability for the SRAMs.
These schemes include cell-VDD (CVDD) adjustment, cell
virtual-ground (VGND; CVSS) bias, various wordline (WL)
voltage, and WRITE-back schemes. However, the conventional
six-transistor (T) cell still fails to lower their minimum opera-
tion voltage (VDDmin) below 0.5 V.
Therefore, many 8T–10T cells have been designed to achieve
sub-0.5 V (near VTH) or sub-VTH operations with a larger
process variation coverage than the conventional 6T cell.
The READ-decoupled (RD) 8T cell [12]–[14] prevents READ-
disturb restrictions but does not significantly increase the WM.

Fig. 1. Circuits of the proposed 10T cell.
Despite achieving the sub-VTH operation with an excellent
READ stability, the RD10T [15], [16], crosspoint 10T (CP10T)
[17], column line assist 10T (CLA10T) [18], and schmitter-
trigger-10T [19] SRAM cells consume a large area overhead
and either have limited improvement in the WM or incur
a degraded WRITE performance. An upsizing-6T (U6T) cell
using a larger transistor size reduce σ − VTH but fail to comply
with the low VDDmin. Moreover, most low-voltage SRAMs
cannot achieve a higher speed (exceeding 100 MHz) for a
0.5 V operation, except the SOI 8T SRAM [13].
This brief presents a novel 10T cell and a hybrid-divided-
block (HDB) array to resolve both the WRITE-failure and
READ-disturbance restrictions while achieving a faster speed
than previous low-VDD SRAMs. A flowthrough (no pipeline)
16-Kb macro is also designed for a 0.5 V platform and fab-
ricated using a bulk 90-nm process. The proposed 10T macro
can be operated at 0.45 V (0.5 V; 10%) with 300-MHz random
access operations and achieve a 240-mV VDDmin.
This brief describes the proposed 10T SRAM cell in
Section II. Section III then introduces the HDB structure and
macro performance. Next, Section IV summarizes the experi-
ment results. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section V.
II. PROPOSED 10T CELL
Fig. 1 shows the proposed 10T SRAM cell. The data is stored
in the 10T cell by the cross-coupled inverters, which are invL
and invR. Two n-type MOS pass-gate (PG) transistors, which

analysis, we adopted 100 mV for the CVDD-down scheme.
With the CVDD-down scheme, the hold VDDmin of the RD8T
cell was around 0.5 V for the process employed. Superior in
terms of the WM, the proposed 10T cell can achieve a lower
WRITE VDDmin than the 8T/10T cells with WA schemes.
Fig. 4(b) compares the WTs of 90-nm SRAM cells. This
analysis only shows the 3-σ WT due to different 6-σ WRITE
VDDmin values across various cells. Notably, the U6T and
RD8T cells have a slow WT at a low VDD. The CP10T/
CLA10T cells have fast WTs due to a high BWL voltage
(100 mV). Owing to the improved WM and differential CVDD,
the proposed 10T cell achieves a fast WT.
Fig. 5 shows the 6-σ READ stability for 90-nm SRAM cells.
As expected, owing to the decoupled READ port, the proposed
10T, CP10T, and RD8T cells have superior READ stability.
Fig. 6 displays the mean and 6-σ data-retention times (DRTs)
of unselected cells during the floating period in a WRITE
cycle (ZWWL = 1) at 125 ◦C for the proposed 10T cell. This
analysis includes the parasitic mismatch between Q and QB
nodes due to the read-PD (RPD) transistor in the 10T cell. The
minimum DRT to the WT difference occurs at a high temper-
ature. Notably, the mean and 6σ tail-bit DRTs are respectively
68 and 6.2 times longer than the required floating period (WT)
at VDD = 0.2 V. Thus, the short-period floating-node behavior
does not incur cell-stability failure for the unselected 10T cells.

III. MACRO IMPLEMENTATION
A. HDB Array Structure
Many high-speed SRAM designs use hierarchical/divided-
BL (DBL) schemes [13], [21], [22] to suppress the BL READ
delay. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of the area overhead and
the speed using various DBL schemes. Various local sense
amplifiers (LSAs), including tristate inverter, NAND-based [13],
and PMOS-based [21] LSAs, are used in DBL schemes to
further improve the BL READ speed. Although LSA-based
DBL schemes achieve the fastest READ speed across a wide
range of VDDs, they consume a significant area penalty in
fitting them within the cell/n-well pitch, particularly for the
LSAs using multiple PMOS transistors. The pass-transistor
(PT)-based DBL scheme takes up the smallest area overhead
compared with other DBL schemes and can improve speeds
at nominal-VDD or super-VTH operations. Therefore, many
consumer (nonlow VDDmin) SRAM macros use PT-based
DBL schemes. However, the PT-based DBL scheme causes
a larger speed penalty due to the increased delay of the PT
when the supply voltage falls below 0.55 V for a 90-nm
process. Therefore, neither the LSA-based nor PT-based DBL
schemes are able to satisfy both the high-speed and small-area
requirements for sub-0.5 V operations.
This brief develops an HDB array structure for the pro-
posed 10T to consume less power, to have a smaller area
overhead, and to achieve a faster speed for the sub-0.5 V
operation. Fig. 8 illustrates the HDB structure. To suppress
the power overhead due to the ZWWL toggling and to pre-
vent half-selected disturbances in WRITE cycles, this macro
applies a divided block structure to WWLs (WWL and ZWWL)
and WBLs. Each WRITE subblock consists of 32 rows and
16 columns. To achieve a higher READ speed below 0.5 V
without using area-consuming LSAs, this brief does not adopt
the DBL scheme for the READ BL (RBL), which has 128 cells.
Unlike using divided blocks for both the RBL and the WBL
or the RBL-based HDB [13], this 10T macro utilized a new
WBL-based HDB, using the DBL only for the WBL but not for
the RBL.

Fig. 11. Die photo.
Fig. 12. Shmoo plot.
The shmoo test is performed for the 10T 16-Kb test chip
(with the high-speed setting) across various supply voltages
for the SRAM macro (VDD_M) and operation frequency, as
Fig. 12 presents. Since the maximum frequency limitation of
the tester is 330 MHz, only the VDD below 0.5 V is measured
for this shmoo test. The 16-Kb macro is functional from 1 V
to 240 mV. This test chip achieves a 300-Mhz operating speed
at VDD = 0.45 V, representing a 10% power-drop noise in
tolerance for a 0.5 V system. This macro also exceeds 330 MHz
at VDD = 0.5 V. The operating speed at VDDmin (240 mV)
exceeds 500 kHz.
Our experiments attribute the failure bits (weak bits) between
193–240 mV to an insufficient RBL voltage swing not because
of the WRITE- or cell-stability failure. It is because this macro
uses a self-timed small-BL-swing sensing scheme for the higher
speed operation. With a relaxed READ WL pulsewidth, i.e.,
a slower speed, the macro is functional at VDD = 193 mV.
Fig. 13 displays the captured READ and WRITE waveforms of
the CLK, the DOUT, and the POUT at VDD = 193 mV with
a relax-speed setting. This experiment uses an in-laboratory
PCB test board instead of a shmoo test due to speed-option-pin
assignment limitation. The measured TAC of this 16-Kb macro
at VDD = 193 mV is 400.2 ns.
The measured speed of the shmoo test is slower than that
of the PCB-based oscilloscope probing. This phenomenon is
owing to the fact that the parasitic loading of the load board for
this tester differs from that of the PCB test board.
Fig. 14(a) shows the speed improvement based on the use of
the FBB scheme at 0.5 V. By biasing VBB to 0 V, the 16-Kb
macro achieves a 44% improvement in access time. Fig. 14(b)
shows the measured standby power and dynamic power
(at 0.5 MHz) of this 16-Kb 10T macro.

V. CONCLUSION
This brief has presented a 10T SRAM cell and an HDB array
to improve the WM and the READ stability while achieving a
speed-area-wise performance for 0.5 V operations. The fabri-
cated 10T 16-Kb macro using the 90-nm bulk-CMOS process
has achieved a 240-mV VDDmin. Furthermore, the macro can
achieve a 300-Mhz speed at 0.45 V.

Abstract—Due to global and local process variations, on-chip
SRAM suffers failures at a low supply voltage (VDD). This study
proposes a differential data-aware power-supplied D AP 8T
SRAM cell to address the stability and trade-off-issues between
write and half-select accesses that still remain in the conventional
8T and 6T cells. Powered by its bitline pair, the proposed 8T cell
applies differential data-aware-supplied voltages to its cross-cou-
pled inverters to increase both stability margins for write and
half-select accesses. A boosted bitline scheme also improves the
read cell current. Two 39 Kb SRAM macros, D AP-8T and con-
ventional 8T, with the same peripheral circuits were fabricated on
the same testchip with 45 nm and 40 nm processes. The measured
VDDmin for the D AP-8T macro is 240 mV–200 mV lower than
that of the conventional 8T macro across lots, wafers and dies.
Index Terms—Low supply voltage, read disturb, SRAM, write
margin.
I. INTRODUCTION
D YNAMIC voltage scaling (DVS) mobile chips [1]–[3]employ a low supply voltage (VDD) during periods of
non-high-performance. This low-VDD operation suppresses
power consumption, gate-leakage, and subthreshold leakage
current and result in longer battery life time. However, at a
lower supply voltage, on-chip nanometer SRAMs suffer from
instability in write and read operations, including a degradation
in read cell current due to ever increasing threshold
voltage fluctuations caused by global and local process
variations. Thus, many 6T-SRAM cells cannot lower their

minimum operation voltage (VDDmin), limiting the applied
voltage range for DVS chips.
Researchers have proposed various assist methods to improve
the write margin and read stability for 6T SRAM cells. Re-
ducing the cell supply voltage (CVDD) [4]–[11], increasing the
cell virtual-ground (CVSS) [6], [12]–[15], and boosted word-
line (WL) [11], [15]–[20] schemes can improve write margins,
but they degrade stability for unselected cells. The differential
CVSS scheme used in [15] improves the write margin, but suf-
fers degradation in cell stability for unselected cells on the ac-
cessed columns (i.e., the column half-select issue). Dual-rail and
raised CVDD schemes [5], [11], [20]–[25] help lower the VD-
Dmin for 6T cells at the expense of extra area and power for
voltage regulations or boosting circuits. Lower wordline voltage
or weaken pass-gate device [4], [8], [10], improves the half-se-
lect (wordline/WL half-select) stability but suffer speed degra-
dation due to decreased read cell current. Write back schemes
[6], [26], [27] improve the half-select stability, but consume
a lot of power due to half-selected bitlines toggling with full
VDD-swing. Negative bitline [28]–[30] schemes improve the
write ability, but cannot achieve a low VDDmin with a wide
tolerance for process variations. Due to the limitations of 6T
SRAM cells and the above mentioned issues, previous assist
schemes can only have limited improvement in VDDmin.
New cell structure and sizing schemes have been proposed to
achieve lower VDDmin with larger process variation coverage
than conventional 6T SRAM cells. A read-decoupled (RD) 8T
cell [15]–[17], [31]–[37], which isolates its read-port from the
storage node, is a popular solution for many DVS chips be-
cause of its superior read stability. However, RD-8T cells do
not significantly increase the write margin (WM), and still suffer
from half-select stability failure. Several read-decoupled 9T or
10T SRAM cells [18], [38]–[42] achieve subthreshold operation
with excellent read stability, but consume large area overhead
and have a limited write margin. Upsizing (UP) 6T cell using
larger transistor size can reduce , but cannot meet the
requirements for further reducing the VDDmin. Asymmetrical
6T SRAM cell [43] can improve the write margin using larger
access-transistors, but this design requires more than 2 area
overhead. Single-ended 6T SRAM cell solves the on-off ratio
issue for read access to achieve subthreshold operation but needs
additional write-assist schemes (CVDD/CVSS) to compensate
the degradation in write margin and require 42% macro area
overhead without addressing the half-select issue [44]. Clearly,
these reported assist schemes and SRAM cells still do not satisfy

pair, instead of sharing the same power line, as in conventional
SRAM cells. Fig. 1(d) shows the column-multiplexed cell array.
When a WL is on, all the SRAM cells on the same row are
activated. However, only one column within a column-multi-
plexed BL group is connected to a sense amplifier or a write
driver. This paper defines the selected cell as the WL-activated
cell on a selected column. The WL-activated cells on the uns-
elected column are defined as “half-selected” or “WL half-se-
lected” cells.
In standby or hold mode, both the PSWL and PSWR are kept
on to supply power from the VDD-precharged bit-
line pair to PUL and PUR of the cross-coupled inverters. Thus,
the hold static-noise-margin (SNM) [46]–[48] of the D AP-8T
SRAM cell is similar (slightly degraded due to stacking effect)
to that of conventional 6T SRAM cell.
A. Write Operation
In a write-0 operation, the BL is pulled down to ground while
the BLB is kept at VDD, as Fig. 2(a) illustrates. Since both the
PSWL and PSWL are on, the PUL source voltage is reduced.
Thus, the PUL has less strength to maintain node Q at “1” and
the trip point of invL becomes lower, resulting in a significant
increase in WM. On the other hand, unlike conventional CVDD
down write-assist schemes [4]–[11], the PUR source voltage is
kept at VDD to enable a faster pull-high speed for node QB
during a write-0 operation. Accordingly, the D AP 8T SRAM
cell has a larger write margin (WM) than 6T and RD-8T SRAM
cells with the same transistor sizes in cross-couple inverters and
access transistors. The WM in this study is the required bitline
voltage compared to ground to flip the SRAM cell, as
Fig. 2 shows.
During the short BL switching period, the pMOS switches
of un-selected D AP-8T cells on the accessed column are
temporarily turned off to isolate the storage nodes from
the BL. Thus, another advantage of this cell is to realize a
“cross-point”-write access that enables it to suppress column
disturbances from the written differential BL. The D AP-8T
cell array does not have any “column half-selected” cell, which
suffers degraded cell stability due to reduced CVDD, as in the
CVDD-down scheme. This also allows the written “1” BL side
to be boosted to increase write speed at a lower VDDmin.
B. Read Operation and Boosted Bitline Read Scheme
In a read-0 operation, the PSWL and PSWR of the selected
D AP-8T SRAM cells are on. During the wordline on period,
the BL is discharged by the PGL and PDL of the accessed
SRAM cell, while the BLB is kept high, as in conventional 6T
SRAM cells. The PSWL and PUL also provide an additional
discharge path for the BL and increase the effective read cell
current. This differential-read operation equips the D AP-8T
cell with better noise immunity and faster read access time than
SRAM cells using a single-end-BL sensing scheme [15]–[17],
[31]–[42].
Moreover, the boosted BL scheme can be applied to the se-
lected column, as Fig. 2(b) shows. Since the boosted BL pro-
vides a “cross-point”-boosted CVDD for PUR and larger
for PDL, it suppresses the voltage bump at node Q and reduces
the body-effect-induced higher penalty of PGL. This re-
sults in a highlighted increase of read cell current and
read static-noise-margin (read-SNM) in a lower VDD.
C. Half-Selected and Unselected Cells
For half-select (or WL half-select) cells, the reduced voltage
on the reading-0 BL decreases the strength of the PUL and
lowers the trigger point of invL for the accessed D AP-8T
SRAM cell, as Fig. 3 shows. This automatically makes invL
harden to flip, even if the storage node Q is raised by being
connected with BL and QB is dropped. Thanks to this “self-neg-
ative feedback mechanism,” the D AP-8T cell can provide a
better cell stability than RD-8T and 6T cells, which keep the
source terminal of PUL at VDD.

6- write margins. Conversely, the D AP-8T cell not only has
the largest write margin, but also the fastest write time across
various supply voltages.
For a target write time in a speed-limited design, Fig. 7 shows
that the D AP-8T cell requires less area than other cells, es-
pecially for the process with large . In other words,
the D AP-8T cell can tolerate a wider variation within the
same area and write time constraints.
Due to additional BL load caused by the pMOS switches
(PSWL/PSWR), the transistor size of dataline (DL) write driver
is 1.8 that of a conventional driver. The area penalty is only

an IO share the same write driver. Though the power overhead
due to additional BL load for write driver is 26%, it is only 3%
compared to the macro-level write power for a 39 Kb macro at
.
B. Read Performance
Fig. 8 shows the normalized read stability (or read-SNM)
of 45 nm SRAM cells. Since the storage nodes are isolated
from the read-port, this read stability analysis does not include
both RD-8T and CRD-8T cells. The D AP-8T cell with 100
mV boosted BL improves the read-SNM by 2.9 and 3.1
compared to the 6T and UP-6T cells, respectively, at
. Obviously, the proposed D AP-8T cell with boosted bit-
line scheme is capable of operating at a lower VDD.
Fig. 9(a) shows the read cell current of several SRAM
cells across various VDD. With a 100 mV BL boosted voltage
, the D AP-8T cell improves the by 2.2 and
1.5 compared to the RD-8T and UP-6T cells, respectively,
at . The large increased in the created
by the boosted BL improves the read speed despite the addi-
tional BL load caused by the pMOS switches (PSWL/PSWR)
in the D AP-8T cell. The BL read speed overhead due to
the additional pMOS drain and wire length per cell is 21%.
Fig. 9(b) shows that the D AP-8T cell achieves 3.2 and 1.5
faster BL read speed compared to the RD-8T and UP-6T cells,
respectively, at .

D. Boosted-Bitline versus Boosted-CVDD
It is worth noted that the boosted-BL scheme for D AP-8T
cell consumes much less boosting power than other SRAM
cells with conventional boosted/raised CVDD schemes for read
operation. Fig. 13 illustrates the schematic and normalized
power consumption for boosting activities. Conventionally

swing at a low VDD due to the cell stability issue of column
half-select cells. Therefore, the D AP-8T macro can achieve
a lower VDDmin-power than the 6T and CRD-8T macros
with boosted-CVDD and CVDD-down schemes. Though the
D AP-8T macro consumes more power than the CRD-8T
macros when operating at the same VDD, the VDDmin-power
of the D AP-8T macro is only 10% of CRD-8T macro, thanks
to its 0.62 V improvement in VDDmin. Without the divided
block structures, the D AP-8T macro still
achieves an 86% reduction in VDDmin-power compared to the
CRD-8T macro.
B. Experimental Results
A testchip with both 39 Kb CRD-8T and D AP-8T macros
was fabricated using two low-power bulk CMOS processes:
45 nm [45] and 40 nm (shrunk from 45 nm) processes. For a
fair comparison, the CRD-8T and D AP-8T macros employ
the same decoding, timing control, and sensing circuits. Fig. 17
shows the die photo of the 45 nm D AP-8T macro.
Fig. 18 shows the shmoo plots of the CRD-8T and D AP-8T
macros for a 45 nm sample with various supply voltages for
SRAM macros (VDD_M) and IO cells (VDD_IO). The mea-
sured VDDmin of the D AP-8T macro is 540 mV, which is
240 mV lower than that of the 8T macro. Since the testchip
was designed to verify hundreds of generic SRAM-compiler
macros that are optimized for nominal VDD operations (1.2 V
to 0.8 V), the peripheral circuits may not work well below 0.6 V
VDD. Due to an over-shifted global process corner, and periph-
eral/digital-IO-pad circuit failures, the measured VDDmin of
the CRD-8T and D AP-8T macros are higher than their simu-
lated VDDmin, respectively. Nevertheless, the lower VDDmin
of the D AP-8T macro enables it to achieve 82% lower energy
(at VDDmin) than the CRD-8T macro.
Fig. 19 also shows the distribution of the VDDmin differ-
ence between D AP-8T and CRD-8T macros for the 45 nm
and 40 nm samples. These 20 samples are from two lots and
six wafers which have similar global process controls. The
VDDmin improvement of the D AP-8T macro ranges between
240 mV to 200 mV for the measured samples. Clearly, the
D AP-8T cell is effective in improving the VDDmin across
processes (45 nm and 40 nm), lots, wafers and dies.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a new 8T SRAM cell powered by its
bitline pair. This design improves the write margin, half-select
stability, and read stability for low-VDD applications. The pro-
posed D AP-8T cell also employs a boosted-BL scheme to im-
prove read speed and read stability. With a lower VDDmin, the
D AP-8T macro can significantly reduce power consumption at
VDDmin significantly. The fabricated macros confirm that the
D AP-8T can achieve a VDDmin that is 240 200 mV lower
than conventional read-decoupled 8T SRAM cells.

Abstract 
This work demonstrates the first fabricated TSV-based 
die-to-die bonding stacked-layer-number-scalable 3D-SRAM 
macro. This 3D-SRAM uses a semi-master-slave (SMS) 
structure and a self-timed differential-TSV signal transfer 
(STDT) scheme to 1) provide a constant-load logic-SRAM 
interface across various layer configurations; 2) suppress 
TSV-induced power and speed overheads; 3) tolerate 
die-to-die variation, and 4) enable pre-bonding KGD sorting, 
to improve the speed and yield of universal-memory-capacity 
platforms. Superior scalability of increasing stacked layer 
number with small speed overheads is demonstrated in the 
fabricated 3D-SRAM macro with layer-scalable test-modes. 
This macro has two SRAM layers that are stacked by a via-last 
process with die-to-die bonding.  
Introduction 
 Through-silicon-via (TSV) is a promising 3D die-stacking 
solution because of its potential for realizing a large bandwidth, 
small form factor, and less limitations on the maximum 
number of stacked layers (NSTACK) [1-2]. TSV technology 
provides a universal-memory-capacity (UMC) platform, 
enabling a pre-designed logic die and different numbers of 
stacked memory layers to be used to satisfy various system 
requirements at lower costs and with a shorter time-to-market 
than 2D specific-memory-capacity SoC methods. 
Currently, TSV has a huge size and cannot fit into the small 
SRAM rows/columns pitch as required in novel conceptual 
3D-SRAMs [3-5]. The via-last process is a popular TSV 
approach because it is simpler than the via-first/middle process 
and provides a higher-yield die-to-die/wafer bonding [6] than 
the wafer-to-wafer bonding 3D-via approach [7].  However, 
the via-last process has the drawback of a larger parasitic load 
(~300fF/TSV) [1]. As shown in Fig.1, since the TSVs across 
layers are shorted in stacked dies using the same mask for both 
non-buffered via-first/middle and via-last processes, the 
parasitic load of a vertical signal is sensitive to NSTACK and TSV 
mismatch. Large-NSTACK designs generate large TSV-load and 
mismatch, resulting in a increasing cross-layer TSV signal 
delay and skew (Fig. 2) and increasing power consumption in 
TSV toggling in high-speed wide-bandwidth designs. Also, 
the TSV-load fluctuation causes variations in set-up time on 
the logic-SRAM interface. Thus, the conventional 
direct-stacking (DS) structure (Fig. 3) has difficulty in 
supporting large NSTACK for high-speed UMC platforms, owing 
to the TSV-induced overheads. 
To make the TSV-based 3D-SRAM much more scalable in 
terms of number of stacked layers, 1) a semi-master-slave 
(SMS) structure and 2) a self-timed differential-TSV signal 
transfer (STDT) scheme are, for the first time, proposed and a 
TSV-based scalable-capacity 3D-SRAM with two SRAM 
layers (die-to-die bonded) is fabricated. This enables 
comparisons of pros and cons with such alternatives as the 
3D-SRAM with inductor-coupling and wire-bonding [8]. 
High Layer-Scalability 3D-SRAM  
A. Semi-Master-Slave (SMS) Structure 
    The master-slave (MS) structure [1] achieves a constant RC 
loading logic-memory interface for various NSTACK by using a 
buffered interface. However, in MS, the central-timing scheme 
leads to less tolerance of die-to-die (D2D) variation across 
slave layers, because slave layers comprise only cell arrays and 
share the same control timings that are generated in the master 
layer. To perform pre-bonding known-good-die (KGD) 
sorting, each MS slave-layer needs extra test logics [3]. 
On the other hand, the SMS structure uses the same 
buffered-interface scheme as is used in MS to achieve a 
constant-load logic-SRAM interface, but each slave-layer has 
its own local timer and bias settings, as in DS, to tolerate D2D 
variation and perform pre-bonding KGD sorting, thus 
increasing the yield. Thanks to having both the main 
advantages of both DS and MS structures (Table I), the SMS 
scheme achieves higher layer scalability with better yield. 
B. Self-Timed Differential-TSV Signal Transfer (STDT) 
Scheme 
To suppress the speed and power overheads caused by the 
large TSV load even as NSTACK is increased, a 
small-voltage-swing STDT scheme is used for cross-layer 
global signal communication in SMS, as Fig. 4 shows. The 
STDT scheme consists of TSV-transmitters (T-TX), 
TSV-receivers (T-RX), and TSV-timers. Two TSVs are used 
to make a signal transmission in STDT differential manner.  A 
TSV-timer is used for each group of signals to control T-RXs 
and T-TXs. Each TSV-timer has 1) dummy T-TXs (DT-TX), 
2) a dummy TSV path (DTP), 3) a TSV voltage detector 
(T-VD), 4) a T-RX enable signal (T-RXEN), and 5) a T-TX 
disable signal (T-TXOFF).  
For example, when the selected slave layer transmits its local 
read data to the master layer, both regular T-TXs and the 
DT-TX of the selected slave-layer drive the regular TSV pairs 
and DTP. Since the driver strength of DT-TX is k times that of 
T-TX, the voltage swing on the DTP (VDTP) becomes k times 
that of T-TX for a given T-TX/DT-TX enabling period. If the 
trigger point for a T-VD is properly designed, then the 
TSV-timer can track the typical voltage of TSV (VTSV) and 
generate the required timing (T-RXEN) to enable the T-RX in 
the master layer to sense the TSV signal. Additionally, the 
TSV-timer sends out the T-TXOFF to disable the T-TXs to 
limit VTSV swing.  This TSV-tracking provides effective PVT 
tracking of the T-TXs and the TSV load of SMS 3D-SRAM 
across various NSTACK.

Circuit Design Challenges in Embedded Memory and Resistive RAM
(RRAM) for Mobile SoC and 3D-IC
Abstract - Mobile systems require high-performance and 
low-power SoC or 3D-IC chips to perform complex operations, 
ensure a small form-factor and ensure a long battery life time. A
low supply voltage (VDD) is frequently utilized to suppress 
dynamic power consumption, standby current, and thermal 
effects in SoC and 3D-IC. Furthermore, lowering the VDD 
reduces the voltage stress of the devices and slows the aging of 
chips. However, a low VDD for embedded memories can cause 
functional failure and low yield. This paper reviews various 
challenges in the design of low-voltage circuits for embedded 
memory (SRAM and ROM). It also discusses emerging 
embedded memory solutions. Alternative memory interfaces and 
architectures for mobile SoC and 3D-IC are also explored.
Introduction
The most important characteristics of a battery-powered 
mobile system are high performance, low power consumption 
and small form factor. To achieve small form factors, 
system-on-a-chip (SoC) and three-dimensional die-stacking 
(3D-IC) approaches are adopted instead of a conventional 
multiple-chip solution. 
Figure 1 compares the performance of volatile, nonvolatile 
and emerging memories. Mobile systems use nonvolatile 
memory (NVM) to provide storage for programs and data in 
the power-off mode. The most commonly used NVM are 
embedded Flash [1] and logic-ROMs [2]-[6]. Smart use of the 
power-off mode can reduce the system standby current. 
Except in logic-ROMs, NVM typically has a low read-write 
speed. Therefore, volatile memories (SRAM and DRAM) are 
frequently embedded in system-on-a-chip (SoC) or 3D-IC 
devices to achieve high-speed operations.
To ensure low power consumption and thus long battery life 
time, mobile systems require both a low dynamic power 
consumption and a low active-mode standby current. 
Numerous portable chips employ dynamic-voltage-scaling 
(DVS) schemes [7], [8] or a low supply voltage (VDD) to 
reduce power consumption. These methods reduce both 
dynamic power and active-mode leakage current, especially in 
ultra-low-power systems and health/biomedical applications 
[9]-[11]. Figure 2 presents an example of dynamic power 
reduction by using a lower VDD for a 90nm SRAM macro.
In 3D-IC, the thermal effect is one of the bottlenecks in 
reducing system standby power. Figure 3 displays the 
measured leakage current of a 512Kb SRAM macro at three 
operating temperatures. Increasing the operating temperature 
from its lowest value to its highest increases the SRAM 
leakage current by a factor of more than 150x. To suppress the 
thermal effect and power consumption in a 3D-IC, the VDD 
must be reduced.
Low minimum-operation-VDD (VDDmin) memory macros 
are needed in DVS and low-voltage devices. Unfortunately, 
many embedded memories cannot achieve low VDDmin 
because of read or write failure. Consequently, memories have 
become one of the bottlenecks to reducing the VDDmin of

bump at Q, associated with VTH variation, may cause data 
flipping in an SRAM cell during a read or dummy-read 
operation. This flipping raises an issue concerning the read 
stability or half-select stability for SRAM. Unfortunately, the 
cell stability, in terms of the static-noise-margin (SNM) 
[29]-[31], is worsened as the VDD decreases, as displayed in 
Fig. 6. The read and half-selection disturbances prevent the 
operation of SRAM at low VDD. Additionally, when the VDD 
is reduced, the SRAM cells also suffer from write failure 
because the write margin is reduced. Therefore, the on-chip 
SRAM is one of the bottlenecks in reducing the VDD (in OR 
of) a mobile SoC or 3D-IC.
B. Mask-programmable ROM
Embedded read-only-memory (ROM) provides a 
cost-effective and reliable solution for storing mature 
programs and data, which do not require code-changing after 
manufacture, because of its small macro area, high reliability 
(data-retention time), and pure logic process that does not 
require the use of high-voltage (HV) devices. The two popular 
embedded mask-programmed read-only memories (ROM) for 
nanometer process nodes are NOR-ROM and NAND-ROM.
NOR-type logic-ROMs [2]-[4] commonly adopted in 
high-speed, small-capacity applications. The
metal-programmable NAND-ROM [5], [6] has a smaller cell 
area, lower power consumption, and small standby current
than NOR-type ROMs.
As mentioned above, in column-multiplexing 
voltage-sensing memories, a wordline (WL) activates all 
bitcells on the same row, and only those bitcells on the 
selected BLs are read out. Hence, voltage swings occur in 
both the selected (selected reading) and unselected (unselected 
or half-selected reading) BLs that access 0-cells in the 
data-sensing phase. In voltage-sensing, the voltage drops on 
the unselected BLs (BL[n+1]/BL[n-1]) produce coupling 
noise, VBL-XT, on the selected BL (BL[n]). The BL crosstalk
from neighboring BLs detrimentally affects the selected BLs,
as shown in Fig. 7.
The charge-sharing effect and bitline leakage current also 
produce read-1 noise: The combined false voltage drop 
(VBL1-NOISE) that is caused by these read noises influences the 
sensing behavior of eNVMs. A small VBL1-NOISE reduces the 
effective VSM1. A large VBL1-NOISE (exceeding VSM1) causes 
sensing failure in the reading of a 1-cell. Unfortunately, 
VBL1-NOISE depends on data [2]-[6] and is worse at a lower 
VDD. Accordingly, choosing an appropriate VREF or
trigger-point for voltage-mode sense amplifiers that are 
operated at both nominal and low VDD is difficult. An 
ultra-low VREF is required to tolerate the VBL1-NOISE. A low VREF
requires a long TBL to tolerate a small ICELL of 0-cells because 
of data-pattern and process variations, creating a large speed 
penalty for eNVMs. Figure 8 reveals that an ultra-long TBL
does not increase VBL0-BL1, because of the BL leakage current. 
However, eNVMs can use a medium VREF and shorter TBL to
improve read speed at the expense of the data-pattern 
coverage rate.
III. Emerging Memories
A. Overview
High-performance mobile devices require fast access to
embedded NVM. The promising next generation of NVMs 
includes PCRAM, MRAM, CBRAM, FeRAM, and RRAM.
These designs have higher operating speeds than conventional 
eFlash devices. PCRAM has a shorter write time than eFlash,
but the write time is still 50ns~300ns owing to the long 
quenching times; PCRAM also has a large write power
consumption. PRAM requires extra circuitry for writing, such 
as that of a current cell regulator or multiple SET pulse 
generators [13], to provide a high resistance ratio for high 
yield sensing. MRAM has a high write speed (10ns~30ns) and 
excellent endurance, but suffers from the need for a limited 
R-ratio to ensure favorable sensing yield. RRAM is also a
promising candidate next-generation universal memory
because of its shorter write time, large R-ratio, multilevel 
capability, and relatively low write power consumption.
However, the switching mechanism of RRAM remains unclear.

stacking of DDR-interface DRAM dies significantly reduces 
the power consumed in processor-memory communication 
compared to that using conventional on-board (off-chip)
DRAM DIMM module.
Unlike the CMD-based approach, the use of an 
“embedded-memory-interface (EMI)” with additional
3D-dedicated pins can fully exploit the advantages of 
TSV-based 3D connection technologies, as shown in Fig. 12. 
The EMI-based approach enables a 3D-IC system to use 
wide-IO parallel data communication at a lower cycle speed 
than can be achieved using the DDR-based serial limited-IO 
high-speed communication between logic/processor and 
memory dies, for a target data bandwidth. Therefore, 
EMI-based processor–memory stacking can increase yield and 
reduce power consumption by eliminating the need for 
complex high-speed IO-interface circuitry.
B. New Memory Structure – Nonvolatile SRAM
Integrating emerging memories in a 3D-IC system with a 
new memory structure may significantly improve system 
performance, especially for mobile devices.
The speeds and VDDmin differences between SRAM and 
nonvolatile memories (NVMs), as displayed in Fig. 1, have 
led to the use of two-macro approach in many DVS mobile 
chips, instead of using a single slow-speed Flash macro. The
two-macro approach reduces the number of NVM access and 
relaxes the endurance requirements for NVM. However, the 
two-macro approach requires a long store time owing to the 
word-by-word (serial) SRAM read and long eNVM write 
procedures
Figure 14 shows several reported nonvolatile-SRAM 
(nvSRAM). These nonvolatile-SRAMs provide a faster 
store/restore speed than the two-macro approach for mobile 
chips, owing to their bit-to-bit parallel data storage. The 
SONOS-12T cell [40] requires a high store-voltage, has a long 
single-bit store-time (TSTORE), and a large area. The 
MRAM-19T2R latch [41] consumes a large store-current 
(ISTORE) and occupies a large area. The Fe-capacitor-6T2C cell

[15]-[18] and eFuse macros [19]-[21] provide one-time 
field-programmable and logic-process-compatible 
features for small-capacity applications, they require a 
large cell-area.

3. Low-Voltage circuit technologies for eNVM 
3.1 Sensing schemes 
eNVM uses two types of sensing schemes to read the 
data stored in memory cells (bitcells): voltage-sensing 
and current-sensing.  
The voltage-mode sensing scheme either discharges a 
bitline (BL) to develop a voltage drop (VBL0) to read a 
0-cell, or remains at the precharged voltage (VPRE) to 
read a 1-cell. A reference voltage, VREF, is chosen 
between the VPRE and VBL0 to differentiate between a 
0-cell and a 1-cell for a sense amplifier (SA). The 
voltage difference between VPRE and VREF is the sensing 
margin for reading a 1-cell (VSM1). The voltage difference 
between VREF and VBL0 is the sensing margin for reading 
a 0-cell (VSM0), as Fig. 5 shows.  
For a memory device with a larger read cell current 
(ICELL) and a shorter bitline, voltage sensing scheme 
enables high-speed operation. Thus, many high-speed 
SRAMs and ROMs employ voltage-sensing scheme.  
Using a long BL developing time, TBL, the voltage 
sensing scheme can generate a significant BL swing 
(sensing margin) to provide a high-yield sensing solution 
for NVMs with ultra-small ICELL, such as multilevel 
NAND-Flash [22], [23]. The voltage sensing scheme is 
capable of sub-threshold operation if the BL developing 
time is sufficient [10]. 
NVMs frequently use current sensing schemes 
because of their advantages in sensing time despite large 
bitline capacitance and small ICELL. To identify the data 
stored in a memory cell, a current-mode SA compares 
the ICELL of the accessed bitcell with the reference 
current for a SA (IREF-SA). The IREF-SA is usually generated 
by a current source or replica cells. eNVMs commonly 
use the replica-cell IREF-SA scheme to generate a dynamic 
IREF-SA, which tracks the variations of ICELL across various 
PVT conditions. Fig. 6 shows a nominal replica-cell 
current sensing circuit for NVMs. The current-mode 
sensing scheme has superior read speed performance 
when the ICELL is small, as Fig. 7 shows. 
Though the current-mode sensing scheme is good for 
super-threshold (higher VDD) voltage operations, it is 
unfortunately not suitable for ultra-low-VDD operations. 
This is because the eNVM ICELL is small at a low VDD 
and the current-mode sensing scheme cannot increase 
the sensing margin with tradeoff in speed. Moreover, 
many current-mode sensing schemes [14], [24]-[27] 
require more voltage headroom (1~2 threshold voltage) 
for bitline biasing and current-mirror circuit.

3.2 Read noise reduction schemes 
In most voltage-sensing eNVMs, a wordline (WL) 
activates all bitcells on the same row, while only those 
bitcells on the selected BLs will be read out. Thus, there 
are voltage swings in both the selected (selected reading) 
and unselected (unselected or half-selected reading) BLs 
that access 0-cells during the data-sensing phase. In 
voltage-sensing eNVMs, the voltage drops on the 
unselected BLs (BL[j+1]/BL[j-1]) generate a coupling 
noise, VBL-XT, on the selected BL BL[j]. Under the BL

(nvSRAM) to provide a better solution for mobile chips, 
thanks to their fast bit-to-bit parallel data storage. The 
SONOS-12T cell [60] requires a high store-voltage, has 
a slow store-time (TSTORE), and a large area. The 
MRAM-19T2R latch [61] consumes a large store-current 
(ISTORE) and area. The Fe-capacitor-6T2C cell [62] 
requires an extra ½VDD bias for SRAM reading and 
NVM access. The PCM-7T2R [63] cell needs a large 
ISTORE and medium TSTORE with degraded cell-VDD 
(CVDD) integrity. The RRAM-6T2R cell [64] has 
degraded cell stability and large cell leakage due to the 
elimination of RRAM-switches. Recently, the 
RRAM-8T2R cell [65], as Fig. 9 shows, achieves 
low-power and high-speed store operation and a small 
cell area. This 8T2R nvSRAM also achieves 
low-VDDmin SRAM operation for DVS chips to save 
dynamic power.

5. Summary 
Low-voltage operation is essential for mobile SoC and 
3D-IC devices due to power and thermal considerations. 
This study discusses various noise reduction and sensing 
schemes for low-voltage eNVMs. This paper also 
reviews several emerging eNVMs, which may replace 
mainstream eNVM in mobile SoC and 3D-IC designs.

Measurement Results and Conclusion 
A 0.18µm testchip (Fig. 10) with a 16Kb Rnv8T SRAM 
macro and a dummy PADin-PADout path was fabricated. The 
16Kb Rnv8T macro achieved a 3.2ns read access time at 
VDD=1.8V. The store-power-off-restore operations are 
verified, as Fig. 11 shows. Fig. 12 shows that the VDDmin  is 
0.45 V for the Rnv8T macro read/write operation across 
various CVDDs and peripheral Power (PVDD) combinations, 
For the first time, a RRAM-based nvSRAM macro is verified. 
The 16Kb Rnv8T achieves the lowest store energy and 
read/write VDDmin than other nvSRAMs or “2-macro” 
approach.

Measurement Results and Conclusion 
A testchip (see Fig. 8) with a 32Kb (256 rows) and a 4Kb 
(32 rows) Z8T SRAM macros, with the 1.3x cell, was 
fabricated using a 65nm low-power 1.2V CMOS process. 
Fig. 9 shows the shmoo plot of the Z8T SRAM macros with 
various SRAM macro-VDD (VDD_M) and IO-VDD 
(VDD_IO). The VDDmin of the 32Kb macro is 440mV, 
which is 430mV lower than that of a 6T SRAM [9] using the 
same process, as shown in Fig. 10. The VDDmin of the 4Kb 
macro is 250mV. The macro area of the 32 Kb Z8T SRAM is 
14% smaller than that of DS8T macro (with divided-BL). 
For the first time, a faster speed but smaller macro area than 
DS8T SRAM is proposed for low VDDmin applications. 
The Z8T cell provides the most area-efficient SRAM cell in 
the largest σVTH/VDD zone.
