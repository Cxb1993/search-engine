Abstract-  
Human arterial hardening increases with 
age and significantly correlates with the 
national top ten diseases. Thus, it is 
worthwhile doing arterial stiffness-related 
investigations. The purpose of the proposal is 
to quantify wave reflection indexes from non-
invasive arterial pressure waveform and to 
explore their applicability. On the basis of 
previous team results, we will first derive, by 
transfer functions, the aortic pulse wave from 
the peripheral arterial pulse wave, and then 
utilize the wave separation analysis (WSA) 
and the pressure waveform analysis (PWA) to 
determine a number of wave reflection indexes 
characterizing the arterial properties, such as 
the augmented pressure at shoulder point 
(APsho), effective length of reflection (Leff), 
augmentation index via the forward and 
backward waves (AIf-b), and so forth.   In 
collaboration with the Department of 
Biomedical Engineering, I-Shou University, 
we make an effort in developing the measuring 
apparatus, analyzing the arterial pressure 
waveforms, and performing the clinical

was recorded by a 2 or 3F micromanometer-tipped catheter 
(Millar, Houston, Tex.) advanced through a Tuhey-borst adapter 
to near the distal end of the catheter. LV volumes at end-systole 
and end-diastole based on ECG signals were estimated by the 
digital X-ray ventriculography.  
B.  Time Constant of Isovolumic Relaxation 
The time constant of left ventricular isovolumic relaxation 
is determined by the following formula, 
 
0
ln
1
ln PtP +−=
τ
                                (1) 
 
where P is the left ventricular pressure, τis the time constant of 
left ventricular isovolumic relaxation, t is time from the 
minimum dP/dt point, and P0 is the estimated left ventricular 
pressure at the time of minimum dP/dt [11].  Left ventricular 
pressure data from the time of minimum dP/dt to a time at 
which left ventricular pressure equaled end-diastolic pressure 
plus 5 mm Hg were used in this calculation.  Although the 
curve of ln P versus t is slightly nonlinear [12], the exponential 
time constant estimated from the pressure fall during 
isovolumic relaxation is a good way to determine how rapidly 
the pressure declines [12],[13]. 
                     
C. Statistic Analysis 
The data are expressed as mean ± 1 standard deviation 
(SD).  Categorical variables between the treated and controlled 
groups were compared using the chi-square test.  Comparisons 
of ventricular variables at first week and at 3-month follow-up 
were made by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which 
is based on a general linear model for repeated measurements, 
with multiple paired comparisons corrected by the Tukey 
method, so as to assess the effect of belonging to the treated or 
controlled groups. Difference between the hemodynamic 
parameters for the intra-groups was assessed by t tests. A p-
value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. 
III. RESULTS 
Basic clinical characteristics for the 26 treated and 12 
controlled patients are summarized in Table I.  The age, height, 
and peak creatine kinase level were comparable between the 
two groups, with a significantly greater weight in the 
controlled group than in the treated group.  
In Table II, no significant difference in the heart rate, end-
systolic pressure and maximum positive derivative of pressure 
is shown between the controlled and treated groups either at 
the first week or at three-month follow-up. It is worthwhile 
noting that the end-diastolic pressure is significantly smaller in 
the patients with thrombolysis than in the controlled patients at 
three-month follow-up, whereas the maximum negative 
derivative of pressure is significantly greater in the treated 
group than in the controlled group.

Abstract—The study aimed to investigate the effects of 
thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) on the time constant of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic 
relaxation.  Of 38 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
recruited in the work, 26 patients (treated group) received 
intravenously thrombolytic therapy within 12 hours after the 
AMI event, and 12 patients (controlled group) received PCI at 
fifth or sixth day after the AMI event.   LV pressure was 
measured with Millar catheters during diagnostic catheterization 
both at first week after admission and at 3-month follow-up.  We 
found that in the patients with the thrombolytic therapy, the time 
constant of the isovolumic relaxation significantly decreases from 
50.1 ± 11.0 ms measured at the first week to 44.2 ± 8.8 ms 
measured at the 3-month follow-up (p<0.05).  In contrast, the 
time constant measured from the patients with PCI is 
significantly increased from 46.3 ± 8.4 at the first week to 63.1 ± 
15.9 ms at the 3-month follow-up (p<0.05).  In addition, the time 
constant was considerably smaller in the treated patients than in 
the controlled patients three months after occurrence of AMI 
(p<0.001).  In conclusion, myocardial microvessels early 
reopened by the thrombolysis may dominantly contribute to the 
improvement in LV diastolic function, suggesting that the 
thrombolytic therapy may play a more progressive role in the 
AMI-related treatment as PCI equipment is not available.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In the decade of the 1980s, short-term and long-term 
mortality of AMI has been dramatically reduced by reperfusion 
therapy, mainly with intravenous thrombolytic agents [1-3].  
Clinical studies had demonstrated that the most powerful 
determinant of survival after AMI was the left ventricular 
ejection fraction [4].  However, the magnitude of the effect on 
ejection fraction has been relatively small, and a consistent 
benefit has been shown only in patients treated early [5].  
Furthermore, the discrepancy between the effects of reperfusion 
on survival and left ventricular ejection fraction has also been 
stated [6-8].   
Although chamber remodeling has suggested as one of 
possible mechanism to improve prognosis in AMI after 
reperfusion therapy [9],[10], its effect on the diastolic 
isovolumic relaxation is required to further elucidate.  
Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to examine the 
response of LV diastolic isovolumic function to 
pharmocological or mechanical reperfusion therapy in AMI 
patients. 
II. METHODS 
A. Experimental Protocol 
The study consisted of 38 consecutive single-vessel AMI 
patients who were divided into two groups: treated and 
controlled groups. At first, the patient's history, medication, 
physical condition, and laboratory data were reviewed in detail. 
If the patient had no contraindications for the thrombolytic 
therapy or PCI-related equipment is not available, this treatment 
was considered first.  
Twenty-six patients in the treated group underwent 
intravenously thrombolytic treatment within 12 hours after the 
AMI event, and twelve patients received the supportive 
medical treatment and PCI at 5th or 6th day after AMI event at 
the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 
Informed consent was obtained from each patient and the 
study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation 
Committee of the Veterans General Hospital.  
LV dynamic pressure, end-systolic volume and end-
diastolic volumes were recorded immediately after the PCI (if 
necessary) and the examination of coronary arteriogram 
procedure via diagnostic catheterization at first week and at 
three-month follow-up.  Continuous LV pressure waveform of

controlled groups calculated at first week and at three-month follow-up. 
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
No significant improvement in systolic contractility of LV 
function, defined as the slope of end-systolic pressure- volume 
relation, has been reported in patients with AMI three months 
after the thrombolytic treatment [14].  In the study, the 
maximum derivative of pressure, another index of contractility, 
does not be significantly altered in the treated patients at three-
month follow-up after thrombolysis, as compared with the 
controlled patients.   
The present results show a significantly reduced time 
constant during the diastolic isovolumic relaxation in the 
patients with AMI at three months after thrombolysis, as 
compared with the controlled group.  The shorter time 
constant suggests an improvement in the relaxation rate during 
the diastole.  Therefore, the time constant calculated from the 
isovolumic relaxation period may become a prognostic index 
for evaluating the recovery of LV diastolic function in patients 
with AMI after thrombolytic intervention.  In addition, the 
higher relaxation rate is another benefit of early thrombolytic 
treatment for patients with AMI.    
Recently, a Doppler- derived index combining systolic and 
diastolic myocardial performance (Tei index) has been widely 
used to evaluate the global ventricular function and remodeling 
of human hearts with AMI [15],[16].  Although the index can 
be non-invasively yielded, several drawbacks are still present 
in further application, such as moderate accuracy and 
repeatability, and large personal variability.  While a slight 
nonlinearity between logarithmic pressure and time during 
isovolumic relaxation exists, the exponential time constant used 
here displays a helpful way to quantify both the decay rate of 
the pressure and the LV dilatation [12,13,18].   
Although a level of TIMI 3 blood flow was observed in the 
infarct-related coronary artery at first week coronary 
examination in both the treated and controlled groups, their 
recovery of LV diastolic function is considerably different.  
The study focuses on the calculation of time constant that is 
defined as the negative inverse of linear relation between the 
logarithmic pressure and time during the isovolumic relaxation.  
We found that a significantly smaller isovolumic relaxation 
rate during diastolic period in the patients receiving the 
thrombolytic treatment than performed with PCI.  The finding 
implies that the isovolumic relaxation time constant may be a 
good prognostic predictor for assessing the recovery of left 
ventricular diastolic function and the chamber remodeling in 
AMI patients receiving myocardial reperfusion therapy.  In 
addition, early reopened microvessels in the myocardium by 
the intravenous thrombolysis may be the potential candidate for 
the recovery of LV diastolic function after the AMI event. 
Thus, the thrombolytic therapy may become a more 
progressive selection in treating AMI patients as the PCI 
facility or staff is not available.
