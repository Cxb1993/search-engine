due to low temperature or lack of carbon sources. The enhanced 
synthesis of CNOs was caused by strong mixing of the fuel and 
oxidizer due to the acoustic excitation at the resonant frequencies. 
Moreover, at high oxygen concentrations a larger amount of CNOs 
could be synthesized than at low oxygen concentrations.

environment were used to synthesize carbon nano-onions (CNOs) on a catalytic nickel substrate. 
The influence of acoustic excitation frequencies, fuel dilution and oxygen concentration on the 
synthesis of carbon nano-structures was investigated. The most important finding of the present 
study is that a mass of CNOs has been synthesized at the excitation frequencies near the 
occurrence of resonance, i.e. at the frequencies close to either the natural flickering frequency 
(10~20 Hz) or the acoustically resonant frequency (66 and 132 Hz). At these characteristic 
frequencies, flow mixing was markedly enhanced by acoustic excitation, and the double flame 
structure with a bright slender core flame was generated, which provided a favorable flame 
environment, i.e. a high radical concentration (carbon source) and a temperature range (heat 
source), for the formation of CNOs.  
The results of acoustically modulated free jet diffusion flames show that for pure ethylene jet, 
the rate of yield of CNOs was high at 10 and 20 Hz (near the natural flickering frequency) for a 
sampling position z =5 mm above the burner exit where the gas temperature was about 450 ~ 
520oC, or at 10, 20 and 30 Hz for z = 10 mm with the gas temperature ranging from 420 to 500 oC. 
Additionally, for both z = 5 and 10 mm, a quantity of CNOs can be obtained at 60 ~ 70 Hz, near 
the acoustical resonant frequency, where the gas temperature was between 620 and 720oC. 
Almost no CNOs were produced for the other frequencies due to low temperature or lack of 
carbon sources.  CNOs synthesized at the low frequencies had a greater diameter and a higher 
degree of graphitization than those at the high frequencies. Moreover, the influence of fuel 
dilution was explored and it was found that the yield of CNOs decreased when the concentration 
of ethylene was reduced at frequency ranges of 10~30 and 60~70 Hz. There were more stacks of 
CNOs in these two frequency ranges than there were without excitation (f=0). However, the 
products transformed into CNTs at f = 20 Hz when the concentration of ethylene was decreased 
to 20%. Double flame structures and low mean temperatures indicate that the heat and carbon 
sources periodically expanded radially, which increased the effective area of combustion 
synthesis in transient flames. 
Ethylene/oxygen-enriched jet diffusion flames modulated by acoustic excitation in an 
atmospheric environment were used to synthesize carbon nano-onions (CNOs) on a catalytic 
nickel substrate. The formation of CNOs was significantly enhanced by acoustic excitation at 
frequencies near either the natural flickering frequency or the acoustically resonant frequency. 
The rate of yield of CNOs was high at 10 ~ 30 Hz (near the natural flickering frequency) for a 
sampling position z = 5 mm above the burner exit where the gas temperature was about 260 ~ 
560℃, and at 10 and 20 Hz for z = 10 mm with the gas temperature ranging from 390 ~ 605℃. 
Additionally, for both z = 5 and 10 mm, a quantity of CNOs could be obtained at 60 ~ 70 Hz, 
near the acoustically resonant frequency, where the gas temperature was between 510 ~ 805℃ 
and 610 ~ 750℃. Furthermore, for both z = 5 and 10 mm, a quantity of CNOs could be obtained 
at 120 ~ 132 Hz, near the acoustically resonant frequency, where the gas temperature was 
between 425 ~ 790℃ and 500 ~ 720℃. Almost no CNOs were produced for the other frequencies 
due to low temperature or lack of carbon sources. The enhanced synthesis of CNOs was caused

flames. SWCNTs were observed to form in a premixed acetylene/oxygen/15 mol% argon flames 
doped with 6100 ppm iron pentacarbonyl vapor and operated at a pressure of 6.7 kPa. A detailed 
characterization of the growth of SWCNTs was given with emphasis on the flame position and 
air-to-fuel ratio. In our recent study [18], the influence of flow rotation on the synthesis of CNTs 
in rotating counterflow diffusion flames was investigated. It has been verified that flow rotation, 
which was associated with the residence time, played an important role in synthesis of CNTs.  
Previous studies of flame synthesis mainly focused on the fabrication of CNTs. It is 
recognized that the formation of CNTs using flame synthesis depends greatly on the catalytic 
metal (such as Ni-Cr, Ni-Cr-Fe wires [8, 9]; Fe3O4, Fe2O3 [17]), hydrocarbon reactants and proper 
environments. Several parameters which affect the growth of CNTs, such as temperature, oxidizer 
concentrations, strain rate and equivalence ratio, have been widely investigated. Different from 
CNTs, carbon nano-onions (CNOs) are quasi-spherical carbon nanoparticles and are made of 
concentric graphitic shells. CNOs have recently attracted much attention of the research 
community owing to their outstanding chemical and physical properties, and important 
applications. For instance, CNOs were already shown to offer a wide variety of potential 
applications, including solar cells, field emission [20], fuel cells [21, 22], optical limiting [23], 
electromagnetic (EM) shielding [24, 25], lubricants [26, 27], and so on. Recently, we have put 
particular focus on the influence of mixed fuel (methane and ethylene) and oxygen concentrations 
on the synthesis of CNOs in counterflow diffusion flames [19]. A threshold value of oxygen 
concentration, 30%, was found for the onset of synthesis of CNOs, and the threshold value of 
methane concentration for the onset of formation of CNOs decreased with increasing oxygen 
concentration or ethylene concentration. Although some progress has been made, research 
literature on the dependence of flame synthesis of CNOs on experimental parameters is still 
limited [19]. Furthermore, appropriate acoustic excitation has been known to have effects on 
enhancing fuel-air mixing and flame stability [28]. However, the mixing effect of fuel and 
oxidizer induced by acoustic modulation on the fabrication of carbon nanostructures, especially on 
CNOs, has not been previously documented.  
In view of the above concerns, in this proposal we aimed to explore the influence of acoustic 
excitation on the synthesis of CNOs using jet diffusion flames and a Ni substrate. A double flame 
structure was developed by a periodic flow due to acoustic modulation. It was found that much 
more high-density CNOs could be generated at the frequencies near the resonant frequency than 
at off-resonant acoustic modulations. The synthesis of CNOs was caused by strong mixing of the 
fuel and oxidizer due to the acoustic excitation at the resonant frequencies. The results of this 
study are of great interest and significance since they show the effects of acoustic excitation on 
the nature of the formation of CNOs.

length) to produce a fully-developed laminar velocity profile at the exit. A mixture of ethylene 
(purity 99.9%), methane (purity 99.9%) and nitrogen (purity 99.9%) was introduced in the inner 
tube and the oxidizer, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, was supplied in the outer annulus. The 
volume percentage of ethylene in the fuel stream and oxygen in the oxidizer stream were denoted 
by ΩE and ΩO, respectively. Throughout each test, ΩE was fixed at 100%, ΩO was varied from 
21% to 40%, and the velocities at the exit planes of the inner tube and outer annulus were 
maintained at V = 0.2 m/s. Ethylene flowed through a regulator and then through a conventional 
flow meter prior to entering the acoustic exciter.  
The acoustic modulation system consisted of a function generator, a power amplifier, a power 
meter, an acoustic exciter (an 80 watt, 8 inch-diameter loudspeaker) and a fuel line. The acoustic 
exciter was installed coaxially beneath the fuel line in the forcing chamber made of hermetical 
acrylics (24×24×13 cm), which was supplied with a sinusoidal driving current of adjustable 
frequency in the range of 0 (unexcited) ~ 3000 Hz (using the function generator). The power of the 
acoustic exciter, P, (related to the amplitude of the excitation) was adjustable, but was kept at 15 
watt in the experiment. 
After the diffusion flame was ignited, the excitation frequency and amplitude was tuned to 
generate various flame configurations. From the observation of flame appearance, interesting 
changes were found in the region near the nozzle exit (flame base). Therefore, we focused the

where n is the multiple number of the resonant frequency; a denotes the sound speed of the tested 
gas. The sound speed of ethylene is about 332.3 m/s; L designates the length of the fuel line, which 
is 2.5 m in this study. Therefore, the prediction of resonant frequency from Eq. (1) is about 66 Hz, 
which well coincides with the resonant frequency obtained in the experiment. At the resonant 
frequency (f = 66 Hz), the radius of the core flame was reduced to the smallest value, and the 
outer blue flame had the greatest height. 
The acoustic frequency range of f = 60~70 Hz and the natural resonant frequency (66 Hz) 
produced the double-layer flame structure. Large ambient air entrainment was periodically 
induced into the burner exit as the compressed section of the sound wave moved toward the exit. 
The jet flow was also compressed at this moment, and a luminous flame core formed. The 
diffusion flame then transformed into a bright partial premixed flame when the stretched section 
of the sound wave arrived at the burner exit [30].

became narrower than the burner diameter. Then the puff flames were divided and discontinuous 
at the flame tails as ambient air entrainment was induced into the burner. Every puff flame would 
transform into the shape of a little mushroom cloud. These flames occurred only at low frequency 
excitation (5~20Hz). 
Flames obtained at f = 30~80 Hz were also affected by sound waves; their sections 
periodically expanded and contracted. However, because the transmission states at f = 30~50 and 
80 Hz had a weaker coupling, the flames were not cut off. Although strong resonant coupling 
occurred at f = 60~70 Hz, the flames remained connected to each other and attached at the burner 
exit. The exciter stroke was lower at high frequencies, especially the stroke at f=66 Hz was only 
about 0.4 times stroke at f = 10 Hz. Therefore, these flames (referred to as attached flames) were 
not cut off.  
The images captured by high-speed camera in f=20 Hz were shown in Fig. 5. It was 
interesting to note that the flame type would change from attached flame to puff flame with 
decreasing ΩE. At ΩE =100%, a flame would become narrower at the burner exit (ψ=0O), and

with the increase of ΩE. For ΩE equal to or lower than 40%, the flame could not endure the flow 
stretch and extinction occurred at f = 10 Hz (dotted line). The occurrence of flame extinction 
around f = 66 Hz was also observed for ΩE = 20% and 30%. The range of frequency for 
extinction to occur was broader for ΩE = 20% than for ΩE = 30%.

carbon nano-materials decreased with decreasing ΩE from 100 to 20% at 10≤  f ≤ 20 (near 
natural flickering frequency) and 60 ≤  f ≤ 70 Hz (near acoustical resonant frequency). In 
addition, carbon nano-materials decreased abruptly at f = 10 and 60 Hz for ΩE = 60%, and at f = 
70 Hz for ΩE = 40%, respectively. Few CNOs were formed at 30, 50 and 80 Hz (non-resonant 
frequencies). 
Figure 9 shows the SEM images at z = 10 mm for 20≤  ΩE ≤ 100% and 0≤  f ≤ 80 Hz. 
Figure 9 indicates that carbon nano-materials were also mainly formed with 10-20 Hz and 60-70 
Hz, with a little formed at 50 and 80 Hz. When compared with Fig. 8, it was found that, unlike at 
z = 5 mm, the yield of carbon-nanostructures remained high at f = 20, 66 and 70 Hz for ΩE = 
100% until ΩE = 20% at z = 10 mm. Moreover, at z = 10 mm (Fig. 9), high-density carbon 
nano-materials were produced at f = 30 Hz for ΩE = 80 and 100%, however, at z = 5 mm (Fig. 8), 
under the same conditions, nearly no carbon nano-materials were observed. This was because the 
mean temperature at z = 10 mm were higher than those at z = 5 mm at f = 30 Hz for ΩE = 80 and 
100%, as shown in Fig. 6. 
    The results in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 suggested that the intensity of double-layer flames greatly 
augmented the formation of carbon nano-structures. When the core flame was narrow and 
luminous, the environment temperature and the concentration of carbon precursors were both 
high. These were thus suitable conditions for carbon nano-structure formation.

at these flame parameters there is not much accumulation of carbon material, therefore, allowing 
carbon species to react with the surface of the TEM grid to form these structures.  
Moreover, in the case of 20 and 66 Hz only highly graphitized carbon structures are present. 
For both f = 20 and 66 Hz, there is a thick layer in the form of a carbon deposition (Fig. 8) and 
the CNTs may still be attached to the walls of the TEM grid under all of the soot material and 
CNOs. The latter statement correlates with the presence of CNTs at f = 20 Hz and ΩE = 20% (not 
so much accumulation of material is present, Fig. 8).  
Therefore, for f = 20 and 66 Hz, the CNT layers may be also attached on the substrate 
surface even for 40≤  ΩE ≤ 100%, but it is difficult proved with TEM images due to the few 
CNT quantity.

core flame (i.e. higher temperature gradient). Generally, the temperature at z = 5 mm was lower 
than that at z=10 mm, except when the temperature peaked at f = 20, 66 and 132 Hz. Three 
temperature peaks were found owing to the slender radius in the region near the nozzle exit at f = 
20, 66 and 132 Hz. The luminous core flame also meant higher concentration of carbon source 
(i.e. radicals from pyrolysis). Thus, the conditions at f = 20, 66 and 132 Hz were expected to 
provide a favorable flame environment with a high radical concentration (carbon source) and a 
suitable temperature range (heat source) for the formation of CNOs. As was expected, the 
formation of CNOs was greatly enhanced near these three frequencies. 
4.2 Flame synthesis of CNOs 
    In order to identify the most favorable flame conditions of the acoustically modulated jet 
diffusion flames for the synthesis of CNOs, the influences of excitation frequency, oxygen 
concentration and spatial location (sampling position) on the production of CNOs were 
investigated. The SEM images of carbon nano-materials synthesized on the catalytic metal 
substrates for 120 s of deposition at the axial positions z = 5 and 10 mm for the excitation 
frequencies in the range of f = 0 ~ 160 Hz and for the oxygen concentrations ranged from 21% to 
40% were used to explore the influences of excitation frequency, oxygen concentration and 
spatial location (sampling positios) on the production of CNOs. Figure 15 shows the images of 
SEM characterizing the typical yields and morphologies of nano-onions represented by the 
various colors of shaded bands. A darker shade indicates a higher yield of CNOs.

Low-yield CNOs
 25
Based on the SEM observations, a complete comparison of the suitable conditions for CNO 
synthesis is shown in Figs. 16 and 17. It was found that the rate of yield of CNOs was high at 10 ~ 
30 Hz (near the natural flickering frequency) for a sampling position z = 5 mm above the burner 
exit where the gas temperature was about 260 ~ 560℃, and at 10 and 20 Hz for z = 10 mm with 
the gas temperature ranging from 390 ~ 605℃. Additionally, for both z = 5 and 10 mm, a 
quantity of CNOs could be obtained at 60 ~ 70 Hz, near the acoustically resonant frequency, 
where the gas temperature was between 510 ~ 805℃ and 610 ~ 750℃. Furthermore, for both z = 
5 and 10 mm, a quantity of CNOs could be obtained at 120 ~ 132 Hz, near the acoustically 
resonant frequency, where the gas temperature was between 425 ~ 790℃ and 500 ~ 720℃. 
Almost no CNOs were produced for the other frequencies due to low temperature or lack of 
carbon sources. The enhanced synthesis of CNOs was caused by strong mixing of the fuel and 
oxidizer due to the acoustic excitation at the resonant frequencies. Moreover, at high oxygen 
concentrations a larger amount of CNOs could be synthesized than at low oxygen concentrations.

on the catalytic metal substrates for 120 s of deposition at the axial position z = 5 mm for the

disorder-induced (D band) modes of graphite, respectively. Also, the intensity ratios of the D- and 
G-bands were lower than one (i.e. ID/IG < 1). This reveals that the intensities of the diamond band 
were lower than those of the graphite band for all the CNOs synthesized in this study, exhibiting a 
high degree of graphitization, and that most of the products were carbon nanostructures formed 
with sp3 (D-band) and sp2 (G-band) bonds. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
CNOs were synthesized in an ethylene diffusion flame modulated by acoustic excitation 
under the influence of the acoustic frequency (f), fuel concentration (ΩE) and oxygen 
concentration (ΩO). CNOs were sampled with Ni grids at 5 and 10 mm above the burner exit. 
It has been verified that synthesis of CNOs was significantly influenced by acoustically 
modulated jet diffusion flames in the atmospheric environment. The most important finding of 
the present study is that a mass of CNOs has been synthesized at the excitation frequencies near 
the occurrence of resonance, i.e. at the frequencies close to either the natural flickering frequency 
or the acoustically resonant frequency. At these characteristic frequencies, flow mixing was 
markedly enhanced by acoustic excitation, and the double flame structure with a bright slender 
core flame was generated, which provided a favorable flame environment, i.e. a high radical 
concentration (carbon source) and a temperature range (heat source), for the formation of CNOs.  
For pure ethylene free jet, at the excitation frequencies close to the natural flickering 
frequency, the enhancement of CNO synthesis can be successfully obtained on the Ni substrates 
at f = 10 and 20 Hz for z = 5 mm where the gas temperature was in the range of 450 ~ 520 oC, or 
at f = 10, 20 and 30 Hz as z = 10 mm where the gas temperature ranged from 420 to 500 oC. 
Additionally, for both z = 5 and 10 mm, a quantity of CNOs can also be obtained at the excitation 
frequencies, f = 60, 66 and 70 Hz, close to the acoustically resonant frequency, where the gas 
temperature ranged between 620 and 720 oC. It is interesting to note that the average diameter of 
CNOs synthesized at the low frequencies (f = 10 and 20 Hz) was about 20 ~ 25 nm, which was 
slightly larger than that (around 15 ~ 20 nm) of CNOs fabricated at the high frequencies (f = 60, 
66 and 70 Hz). On the contrary, nearly no carbon nano-material was observed for the other 
frequencies due to low temperature or lack of carbon source. For the acoustically modulated 
flames experiencing the excitation frequencies near the occurrence of resonance (10~30 or 60~70 
Hz), the luminous core flame was a carbon-rich environment. The mean temperatures at sampling 
positions were lower than 900~1400K [34]. The heat and carbon sources periodically expanded 
radially, which increased the effective area for combustion synthesis. CNOs were the major 
products obtained in this study. They formed in large quantities at 10~30 and 60~70 Hz. The

ABSTRACT A brief introduction of the recent research at Dalian University of Technology 
(DUT) on the applications of the large eddy simulation (LES) approach to fuel sprays in a 
constant volume vessel and in a real engine configuration is presented. Firstly, the fundamental 
of the LES approach and related mathematical models are briefly described. Then some aspects 
concerning applications of LES to the fuel spray in the engine environment arc discussed, 
including comparisons between RANS ( Reynolds Averaged Navier - Stokes equations) and 
LES models; an examination of the influence of different subgrid scale (SGS) models on fuel 
spray and their applicability to IC engines; a performance assessment of four breakup models in 
connection with the LES simulations; as well as example of the LES application to a Ford 2.0 
liter high-speed direct-injection (HSDI) diesel engine. Finally, suggestions to the further LES 
study in the engine area are proposed. 
4. “Experimental Simulations on Combustion Chamber Deposits of Spray Flames” Ta - Hui Lin 
(National Cheng Kung University ), Wei - Dong Hsieh (King Abdullah University of Science 
and technology ) 
ABSTRACT Combustion chamber deposits are usually observed in various internal 
combustion devices. They result in negative effects on the operation and performance of these 
devices. Study of deposits formed in the internal combustion devices is not easy and usually 
time-consuming. Therefore, we proposed an experimental method to simulate the deposit 
formation on the combustion chamber wall by considering a spray flame impinging onto a 
stagnation plate. Using this method, deposits can be readily generated on the stagnation plate, 
and it is easy to extract them for further chemical or physical analysis. In this paper, we first 
focused on the gasoline deposits, and later on the diesel deposits, generated on the water-cooled 
stagnation plate. The comparisons of gasoline deposits from the stagnation spray flame and 
from actual CFR engine tests exhibited good qualitative correlations. Concerning the diesel 
deposits, they had great difference with the gasoline deposits in the appearance. However, the 
effect of the cooling water (the wall temperature) and deposit growth history for the diesel 
deposits were basically similar to those of the gasoline deposits. This method may be used as a 
preliminary test on understanding deposit formation or for fuel formula developing. However, 
further studies are needed to justify its applicability to real engine CCD simulation.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Spray combustion has been widely used in industrial 
applications. Its burning characteristics are controlled by 
the drop size and distribution in the combustion system. 
Studies of the evaporation and combustion characteristics 
of a single drop and the interaction between burning drops 
are the two major research topics in drop combustion.  
On the studies of single drop, they focused on the 
evaporation and combustion pattern but not the interactions 
between drops. These studies are performed in ordinary and 
micro gravity environments. In ordinary environments, the 
evaporation of drop is determined by ambient temperature, 
external flow, pressure and properties of the fuel [1]. In 
micro gravity environment, external factors such as density 
can be simplified due to the lack of gravity effect. It is 
noted that an obvious soot layer can be observed in the 
micro gravity environment whereas the soot layer in the 
ordinary environment drop combustion can be observed 
only in incomplete combustion condition.  
Yozgatligil et al. [2] investigated the drop 
evaporation rate in micro gravity environment. Results 
show that the increase in ambient pressure does not affect 
the evaporate rate but increase in ambient oxygen content 
or drop size enhances drop evaporatio. On the effect of 
ambient pressure, Avedisian and Bae [3] studied the 
burning behavior of nonane (C9H20) under atmospheric 
pressure and high pressure. They found the flame of the 
burning drop is blue at atmospheric pressure but it gets 
brighter and yellower with the increase of pressure. 
Spectroscopic analysis shows the change in flame color 
may result from the increase of CH and C2 species at 
higher pressure. With the increase of these species, exterior 
soot layer of the burning drop gets thicker and the flame 
color changes from blue flame to yellow flame with strong 
thermal radiation. In addition to flame color changes, the 
increased pressure also decreases the droplet extinction 
time. They further analyzed the soot layer formation of 
burning drops [4]. It is indicated that the structure of the 
soot layer differs with different fuel and additives.  
Yozgatligil et al. [5] studied the evaporation rate, 
flame temperature and carbon soot production of a drop by 
varying the oxygen concentration and inert gas type (argon, 
helium and nitrogen). It is shown that the evaporation rate 
is largest when using helium as inert gas and lowest when 
using argon. The soot production has the opposite trend 
with the evaporation rate.  
In real applications of spray combustion, interactions 
between the burning drops are commonly observed and the 
flame propagation characteristics will affected by these 
interactions. On the study of drops interaction, Mikami et al. 
[6] studied the drop interaction without convection by using 
a suspension drops array in micro gravity environment. It is 
noted that the flame spread mode can be categorized into 
three modes. When the inter-space (defined as the ratio of 
drops space to drop size) between drops is small, flame of 
the burning drop propagates fast and ignited the 
neighboring drop before it evaporates. With the increase of 
inter-space, the neighboring drop will be evaporated by the 
heat from the burning drop before the flame is reached. 
Group combustion still holds. When inter-space is over 10, 
the neighboring flame can still be ignited by the burning 
drop. But the burning is individual combustion instead of 
group combustion. When the inter-space is over 15, flame 
ceases to spread across the fuel drops. Other related study 
reported a critical inter-space for flame spread is 8 [7, 8]. It 
is also noticed that the neighboring drop moves away from 
the burning droplet before the flame can spread to it. The 
displacement of the neighboring drop is remarkable when 
the inter-space is close to the critical one. 
On the effect of inter-space on evaporation of drops, 
it is found the evaporation rate of drops array is lower than 
that of single drop when the inter-space is 3 or 4. When the 
inter-space is over 5, the evaporation rate will be identical 
to that of a single drop burning. That is, there is little 
interaction in the span wise drop array when the inter-space

ABSTRACT   In a spray combustion flow field, a burning drop may interact with other drops flowing in parallel streams or 
along the same flow stream. Many studies on drop interaction in parallel streams were reported. However, 
upstream/downstream interaction of drops along a burning drops stream has not been well studied literately. To understand such 
interesting phenomena, we established an experimental system to examine a burning dodecane drops stream with variable drop 
inter-spaces in a high-temperature oxygen-rich environment. Effects of the drop inter-space (s/di) and the oxygen concentration 
(ΩO2) in the hot environment on the interaction of burning drops were investigated in the study. Drop inter-spaces were chosen 
to be 2.5, 5, 10, 30 and 100. Oxygen concentrations of 21%, 25% and 30% in the hot environment were considered. The flame 
propagation and interactions between the burning drops in the stream were performed. Results showed that the diffusion flame 
enclosing the drops stream is narrowed with the increase of ΩO2 whereas effect of ΩO2 is not obvious when s/di>30. The overall 
flame length was longer for lower s/di due to flame propagating across the drops. Evaporation rates remains constant when 
s/di>30 indicating a weak interaction of drops along the same stream.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
In the following results and discussions, we will 
focus on the burning behavior of drop in the drops stream at 
different drop inter-space and ambient oxygen 
concentrations. Fig. 3 shows the direct photographs of the 
burning drops stream at different drop inter-spaces (s/di=2.5, 
5, 10, 30 and 100) and ambient oxygen concentrations 
(ΩO2=21%, 25% and 30%). These photos were taken by a 
digital camera with shutter 0.4s, aperture 5.3 and ISO100. 
As mentioned in the experimental setup section, the stable 
drops stream was generated by the drop generator and then 
entered the high temperature environment. As the drops 
entering the hot environment, it needs time to evaporate 
before it is ignited. Therefore, it is observed that the drops 
stream is not ignited until approximately 5~7cm away from 
the quartz chamber inlet. With the drop velocity 
predetermined by the camera method, the ignition delay 
time (tid) can be calculated as tabulated in table 1. The 
ignition delay time is defined as the time interval from the 
drop stream entering the quartz chamber to the ignition of it. 
From this table, it can be observed that the differences in 
the ignition delay time are very small. The ignition delay 
time is around 0.023s. The effect of drop inter-space on the 
ignition delay time is not obvious. However, the ambient 
oxygen concentration has more obvious effect on the 
ignition delay time. The ignition delay time observed to 
decrease with the increase of ΩO2. Higher ΩO2 may enhance 
the diffusion of fuel vapor and provide more oxidant for the 
drop to burn, therefore, the ignition of drops stream is faster 
in higher ΩO2.

stream after it entered the quartz chamber.

30% 0.022 0.022 0.024 0.024 0.022
 
Comparing the flame width and flame length of the 
burning drops stream of different drop inter-space in a 
constant ΩO2, both flame width and length are observed to 
decrease with the increase of drop inter-space. The same 
phenomenon exists in ΩO2 of 25% and 30%.  
At low lower s/di, the interaction of drops in a stream 
is strong. Trajectory of the drops in a burning drops stream 
may be affected by the fuel vapor accumulation and wake 
flame of the preceding drop. As a consequence, the flame 
width is larger at lower s/di. Besides, the flame may spread 
across multiple drops and attain a group combustion status 
due to the accumulated fuel vapor and low s/di which is 
similar to [6-8]. This is the reason for the increased flame 
length when s/di is low. Contrarily, the flame width and 
flame length decreases due to less intensive drop 
interactions at larger s/di.  
On the effect of ambient oxygen concentration, it is 
observed that the flame length increases with the increase 
of ΩO2. With more oxygen, the burning drops can burn at 
further downstream and the burning stream lasts longer 
which postponed the extinction point.   
To further clarify the drop interactions in the burning 
drop stream, we used high speed camera to capture the 
instantaneous images of the burning drops stream of 
different drop inter-spaces with the ambient oxygen 
concentration 21%. Fig. 4 shows the photos of burning 
drops stream taken at different x-position. Due to the 
limited view of the high speed camera, the view size of 
each photo is 1cm. That is the first photo starts from x=8.5 
to x=9.5, the second photo starts from x=14.5 to x=15.5, 
and so on. At s/di=2.5, the drops stream is ignited at x=7cm. 
After the drop stream is ignited, the enhanced drop 
evaporation from drop burning enlarged the inter-space. As 
a consequence, the drop inter-space in the first photo of Fig. 
4 (x=9cm) is slightly larger than the initial value (s/di=2.5). 
Looking closely at the flame transition at different position, 
it is noticed that the flame was formed in front of the drop 
when it moves downward. This is because the initial flow 
speed in the quartz tube is larger than the drop speed. As the 
drop moving further downward, it accelerates due to the 
gravity. There is equilibrium between the flow speed and 
drop speed. In the second photo (x=15cm), it is observed 
the flame moves upward and surrounds the drop spherically. 
When the drop moves further downstream, its speed is 
greater than the flow speed, the flame moves to the back of 
the drop consequently. At x=20cm, the drop inter-space 
between drops is observed to be not uniform. According to 
the study of Nomura et al. [7], the movable drop would be 
shifted by the flame spreading. In this study, strong 
interaction of flame spreading between closed allocated 
drops resulted in the fuel vapor accumulation, which 
expanded the flame size and resulted in the instability for 
the drop movements. Therefore, some drops move away 
from each other while others collide together as observed in 
the images. It is also noted that the surrounding flame may 
merge together across several drops and attains a group 
combustion status. The trajectories of drops are affected by 
the flame sheet from the preceding burning drop and the 
successive drop moves in lateral direction randomly. This 
phenomenon is more clear from x=20cm to x=30cm. This 
explains the increase of flame width of drops stream at 
lower s/di observed in the Fig. 3. 
When the drops stream moves further downstream to
