Abstract
Business decision makers have come to realize that outsourcing can effectively enhance
market competitiveness, and sustain the firm’sdevelopment. This study considers the
trade-off between in-house production and outsourcing in a two-echelon supply chain. The
objective is to optimize the total profit per unit time of the system. The deterministic model is
developed. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are provided for illustration.
Keywords: Inventory control; Outsourcing; In-house production; Opportunity cost
3Cm in-house production cost per unit( $ / unit )
Co outsourcing cost per unit ( $ / unit )
Cp original opportunity cost; including the equipment cost and the management
cost for in-house production
p selling price per unit
TR total revenue per unit time
TC total cost per unit time
T total profit per unit time
The model is developed with the following assumptions:
1. The original demand rates of in-house production, d1, and the original demand rates of
outsourcing, d2, are deterministic.
2. The selling price of all items are the same regardless which is from in-house production or
outsourcing.
3. Customer’s demand folows a function, ( )d r , of outsourced fraction of demand, r,
such that:
1 2( ) (1 )d r r d rd   .
Since d1> d2, it means that moreoutsourced fraction leads to less customer’s demand.
4. The in-house producing units are as new as the outsourcing units.
5. The lead time between Stage 1 and Stage 2 of Figure 1 is assumed to be zero.
3. Model development
In this section, the mathematical model for the problem is developed. The inventory
system is referred to Figure 1. A two-echelon inventory system contains a distributor (Stage
1), a warehouse (Stage 2) consisting both an in-house production part shifted from Stage 3
and an outsourcing part, and an in-house production part (Stage 3). The distributor places
orders in response to the customer’sdemand. For each cycle at Stage 1, Q units are ordered
from Stage 2. Each cycle at Stage 2 satisfies nQ units of demand from Stage 1. Stage 2
obtains these nQ units from two sources –in-house production and an outsourcing supplier.
The cycle length of Stage 2 is / ( )nQ d r . In each cycle, Stage 2 can receive rnQ units of
outsourcing inventory. The remaining (1 −r)nQ units have to be manufactured from the
in-house production.
If the inventory level stays positive, the inventory plot at Stage 1 would be shifted by the
same amount, and there would be pipeline stock between Stage 1 and Stage 2. Since the
pipeline stock cost is not relevant to the model, it would not affect this analysis. From the
statement above, one has

where k>0, is a constant. This means the more outsourced fraction of demand, r, leads to less

Due to the complexity of ( , , )T Q r n , it is hard to prove the concavity. Accordingly, a
solution procedure is developed.

75. Conclusion
Most of the papers available in literature address the problem for outsourcing with
empirical research. The literature on model development is very limited. This paper applies
the past empirical results to develop a profit model.
In the recent years, due to limited resources, outsourcing plays a critical role in
improving a firm’s overal competitiveness.The firm can distribute the resources mostly to
its core task, reduce its total operating costs and generate greater value. However, there exist
both the proposed advantages and the suspected disadvantages of outsourcing. This paper
considers the trade-off between in-house producing and outsourcing in a two-echelon supply
chain to develop a deterministic model for the system. Solution procedure is developed.
Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are provided for illustration. From sensitivity
analysis, we can see the trend of outsourced fraction, r. The results obtained in this paper will

1. Introduction 
Business decision makers have come to realize that outsourcing can effectively enhance 
market competitiveness, and sustain the firm’s development. In doing so, the firm expands 
outsourcing to products that are near-core but are not in their economic size. In recent years, 
many firms have undergone a series of transformation such as downsizing and reorganizing, 
and outsourcing has become one of the most dominant fashions. By outsourcing products, the 
firm’s service value is ameliorated, service speed is elevated, but service cost is reduced. By 
the same token, the firm can distribute the resources mostly to its core task which reduce its 
total operating costs and generate greater value. Outsourcing plays a critical role in improving 
a firm’s overall competitiveness. Therefore, it is a critical subject for every firm to trade-off 
between in-house production and outsourcing.  
Alvarez and Stenbacka (2007) applied a real options approach to develop a general 
characterization of a firm's optimal organizational mode. Bengtsson and Berggren (2008) 
explored the dynamics of outsourcing and production strategies in the telecom equipment 
industry. Kuo et al. (2010) considered a three-tier supply chain consisting of an original 
equipment manufacturer, a contract manufacturer and a supplier to analyze and compare three 
outsourcing structures. Kaya (2011) considered an outsourcing model in which the supplier 
makes the effort decision and an in-house production model in which the manufacturer 
decides on the effort level and compared these two models with each other. Liu and Nagurney 
(2011) studied the impacts of foreign exchange risk and competition intensity on supply chain 
companies who were involved in offshore-outsourcing activities. This study considers the 
trade-off between in-house production and outsourcing in a two-echelon supply chain. The 
objective is to determine the decision variables and to optimize the total profit per unit time 
of the system. 
 
2. Assumptions and Notation 
The following notations are used throughout this paper: 
Ai set-up cost at Stage i (i = 1, 2, 3) 
hi holding cost per unit per unit time at Stage i (i = 1, 2, 3) 
d1 original demand of in-house production per unit time 
d2 original demand of outsourcing per unit time, d1> d2; This means that the 
products from outsourcer sometimes give a harmful impression to customers; 
In real world, the products are usually marked in the location of manufacturing 
factory for the customers to distinguish in-house production or outsourcing 
such as clothes, tennis ball. 
r outsourced fraction of demand per unit time (0 < r < 1); decision variable 
Q order quantity at Stage 1; decision variable

Since the denominator of Hessian matrix value, Q4 is positive, we only need to estimate 
the positive interval of numerator (-0.09 Q4+2400 Q2+9720000Q-16000000). From Figure 2, 
the positive interval is 2<Q<500. Therefore, the positive-definite Hessian matrix results in 
optimal (Q2*, r2*) values as 2<Q<500 and 0<r<1. By setting 0 QT  and 0 rT , 
one has Q2*=86.3, r2*=0.34, and T =$2590. For n=1, 3, 4, and 5, the solution is listed as 
follows in Table1:

d1 =140, d2=100, p=60, cm=30, co =35, A1 = 25, A2 = 100, A3 = 50, h1 = 2, h2 = 1, h3 = 0.3, cp =3000, k=9.

From Table 1, the optimum is n*=2, Q*=86.3, r*=0.34, and T *=$2590.

由於產業環境境的改變及國際市場競爭日趨激烈，許多企業為了提昇自身競爭能力、降低
成本與風險，並增加企業的經營彈性。於是，可以使生產變得更快速、便捷的「外包」生
產制度，遂成為必然的趨勢。在高度競爭的環境下，許多企業以「外包策略」來進行生產
和服務，進而追求好的績效，並以此來提昇公司的核心競爭優勢。 
本研究係將不同的需求型態導入存貨模式，探討在兩階供應鏈的生產系統中，考慮採取「自
製」或「外包」的最佳策略。研究方法主要採用存貨理論模式進行研究，建立問題的數學
模式，以利潤最大化（或成本最小化）為目標，運用最佳化理論求出最佳訂購量、最佳缺
貨量及最佳訂購期等….。以數值範例說明所建立模型的應用情形，並對重要參數進行敏
感度分析。 
由於利潤之計算相當複雜且凸性不易證明，故建構了『解題程序』以協助最佳解之取得。
研究結果顯示一階中的供應商，係依顧客的需求量訂貨。而設定相關參數值，在數值範例
中依解題程序驗證，得知一階中的供應商在供應週期為 2時，可求得的利潤為最佳。 
本研究可提供給管理者作決策制訂，而目前係對確定需求求解，日後研究希望延伸至隨機
性的需求存貨模式。再者、企業與服務廠商在合作時，除了要以誠信相待，外包合約如何
訂定以及產品係全數外包或部份比例外包，都要審慎考慮。
