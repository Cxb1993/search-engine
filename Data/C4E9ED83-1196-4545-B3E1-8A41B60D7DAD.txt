mentioned observations, a joint time synchronization
and channel estimation scheme [12] is proposed based
on m-sequences. An optimal threshold is derived to
identify the first channel tap in conjunction with the
CIR estimate. However, the calculation of the optimal
threshold requires knowledge of partial channel
information (the average power of the first channel tap),
which could be unavailable.
In this report, we propose a practical joint time
synchronization and channel estimation scheme based
on m-sequences. The proposed approach relies on an
adaptable threshold, which is derived from analyzing
the probability density functions (PDF) of the
corresponding crosscorrelation function outputs. The
adaptable threshold adjusts itself to the noise level and
the period of the m-sequence. Since the period of the m-
sequence is known to the receiver and the noise level
should be constantly monitored, the proposed adaptable
threshold can be obtained accordingly.

3.1 Essentials of the Proposed Approach
In this report, we assume that coarse time
synchronization and carrier frequency offset (CFO)
estimation have been done by utilizing the cyclic
extensions within the training sequence [4] [5].
Consequently, the effect of CFO is temporally dropped
in the system model for clarity.
3.1.1 The Training Sequence
The proposed scheme is developed based on the
training sequence described in Fig. 2. The training
sequence is composed of an m-sequence attached by
both cyclic prefix and postfix. The autocorrelation
function of an m-sequence is periodic and two-valued.
For a bipolar m-sequence bP=[b(0), b(1), …, b(P−1)],
where each sample within the sequence is either +1 or
−1, its autocorrelation function can be shown to be

where the notation (())P represents the operation of
modulo P. Assuming M1 and M2 represent the lengths of
the cyclic prefix and postfix, respectively, the relation
b(n)=b(n+P) holds for n=−M1, −M1+1, …, M2−1. A
reasonable constrain is made that both the lengths of the
cyclic extensions are chosen to be longer than the
number of effective taps of the sample-spaced CIR,
which is denoted by hL=[h(0), h(1), …, h(L−1)].
3.1.2 The Correlator Output
Due to the cyclic extensions attached, part of the
received training sequence can be modeled as the cyclic
convolution of the CIR and the m-sequence. For time
indexes n=−M1+L−1, −M1+L, …, P+M2−1, it can be
expressed as

crosscorrelation function shows different characteristics
in regions R1 and R2 respectively. In region R2, it
contains the CIR garbled by interference and noise. The

3.1.3 Analysis of the Probability Density Functions of
Crosscorrelation Function Outputs
Based on the results derived in (3), for a time
index 1d R , the crosscorrelation function output
contains an interference term and a noise term. In order
to analyze the related PDFs, some relevant notations are
introduced. Let wr(n) and wi(n) represent the real and
imaginary part of w(n) respectively. In addition, the
samples of {wr(n)} and {wi(n)} are independent zero-
mean Gaussian random variables with the same
variance 2 2w . Since the samples of {wr(n)} and {wi(n)}
are i.i.d. and samples of {b(n)} are either +1 or −1, one
can infer that

3.2.1 Complexity Issues
Both the proposed scheme and the one described in
[8] require the calculation of the crosscorrelation
function between the received training sequence and the
reference sequence, which dominates the computational
complexity. Since the reference sequence in the
proposed scheme contains only 1 , the crosscorrelation
function can be calculated through additions rather than
multiplications. The computational complexity required
to calculate the crosscorrelation function for each time
index is illustrated in TABLE I.

3.3 Simulation Results
In our simulations, different approaches are
evaluated under 10-path Rayleigh and Ricean fading
channels. It should be noted that Ricean channels can be
distinguished by their K factors in the legend. An
OFDM packet is composed of a training sequence
followed by several OFDM data symbols. The structure
of OFDM data symbols within the transmitted packet
followed the same specifications described in [1]. A
CFO, which is uniformly distributed
within 0.5 subcarrier spacing, is introduced
independently from one packet to another. A
modulatable orthogonal sequence is adopted to form the
training sequence described in Fig. 1. The
corresponding parameters were chosen as (M1, P,
M2)=(18, 64, 17). It should be noted that the period of a
modulatable orthogonal sequence should be the square
of a natural number. A primitive polynomial of degree 6
(1+D+D6) is adopted to generate an m-sequence with
period 26−1. The parameters (M1, P, M2)=(18, 63, 18)
are chosen to form the training sequence described in
Fig. 2.
The proposed approach and two related schemes [8]
[12] are evaluated in several aspects. The probability of
perfect time synchronization is illustrated in TABLE II.
For a Rayleigh fading channel [13], the scheme
proposed in [12] achieves the highest probability of
perfect time synchronization due to the utilization of an
optimal threshold (βopt). However, the optimal threshold
requires knowledge of partial channel information as
mentioned before. On the contrary, the proposed
adaptable threshold can be acquired by the receiver
without any partial channel information. With the
proposed scheme, the resultant probability of perfect
time synchronization approaches to the results obtained
by utilizing an optimal threshold. As to the scheme
proposed in [8], where the choice of the key parameter
alpha is solely based on trial and error. Once a particular
alpha is chosen, it remains fixed, which leads to inferior
performance.

The bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the
proposed approach and the scheme described in [8] are
demonstrated in Fig. 5. As one can observe, the
proposed approach described in section III-A
outperforms the conventional scheme due to the
utilization of an adaptable threshold, which adjusts itself
to the period of the m-sequence and the noise level.
During our simulations, we have noticed that although
dR is supposed to detect the last channel tap, it tends to
locate on a prior tap since the tailing taps are
statistically less significant than the preceding taps.
Consequently, the proposed approach described in
section III-A generaly results in “shortened” CIR 
estimates. In order to cope with this effect, we modify
the proposed approach by adjusting the right-most time
index from dR to dL+2(dR −dL). This modified version is
denoted as “Proposed II” in Figs. 5 and 6. The proposed 
modification further enhances the BER performance
since it includes more channel taps as compared to the
original version. As to the scheme described in [8],
