field strength on the filtration rate and total solid deposition rate on the collection electrode was 
evaluated.  Results indicate that the extent of filter fouling is greatly decreased.  Majmudar and 
Manohar (1994) studied the separation of TiO2 from aqueous solution by electrophoretic 
filtration.  Experiments were carried out at different voltages and flow rates.  It was observed that 
a maximum separation of 96% occurred at 15 V and 200mL/h flow rate.  Wakeman and Sabri 
(1995) demonstrated that direct current electrostatic field reduced cake formation in cross-flow 
membrane filtration.  Operating parameters such as filtration pressure, cross-flow velocity, 
electrostatic field gradient, pH and feed concentration can affect filter performance.  Verdegan 
(1986) studied the separation of fine particles (< 10 µm) from nonpolar liquids by cross-flow 
electro-filtration process and reported that cross-flow electro-filtration has many distinct 
advantages over conventional separation processes such as high removal for all particle size, 
long life, and minimal power requirement.  Akay and Wakeman (1996) observed an enhanced 
removal of a double chain cationic surfactant (diocatadecyldimethylammonium chloride) in 
water using the cross-flow electro-filtration process.  Wakeman (1998) reported 
electrophoretically assisted cross-flow microfiltration of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 
ovalbumin and denatured lactalbumin.  It is shown that the steady state flux is higher when an 
electrostatic field is applied than what is with conventional cross-flow microfiltration.  The flux 
is almost independent of the membrane pore size.  Finer pore sizes enable steady state flux and 
faster arrival of rejection conditions. von Zumbusch et al. (1998) reported that the alternating 
electrostatic field diminished membrane fouling and hence yielded a higher specific filtrate flux.  
The effect of the electrostatic field depends on frequency (0.5 to 50 Hz), field strength (0 to 80 
V/cm), conductivity (1 to 10 mS-1), and protein concentration (0.1 to 5 w%).  Low frequency and 
high electrostatic field strength yield the best result for electro-filtration with alternating current 
fields.  The effect of the electrostatic field increases with rising conductivity up to the point 
where a limiting electrolytic current is reached.  Increasing protein concentration diminishes the 
effect of the electrostatic field. Huotari et al. (1999) reported that applying an electrostatic field 
across cross-flow filtration can greatly increase the flux rate.  Weigert et al. (1999), conducted 
the first pilot plant study on microfiltration of mineral and biological slurry with cross-flow 
filtration, coupled with constant and pulsed fields and reported that the specific permeate rate 
markedly increased compared to the value without an electrostatic field.  For mineral slurry, the 
increase in flux rate was more than 10 folds.  An estimation of the specific energy input

used for each experiment.  Kenmore 10-µm pore size membranes were obtained from a local 
supermarket. 
The CFEF filter unit was fed from a Milipore® cross flow filter module, model ProFlux M12.  
A pressure sensor was installed at the inlet and the outlet of filtrate and concentrate.  A computer 
with necessary software was used to control the filtration rate and flow direction and continually 
record the pressure of the inlet and the outlet streams. 
Filtration Operations 
Experiments were conducted to characterize the performance of the CFEF module under 
various conditions specifically, solid concentration and applied voltage.  The suspension was 
made up to a known concentration using either dry powder or slurry added to distilled water and 
the resultant mixture was stirred in the feed tank for two hours to ensure a constant influent 
concentration.  The dispersion was stirred in the feed tank and re-circulated over time as to 
produce a homogenous mixture and to allow the particles to adsorb onto the surfaces of the rig.  
The suspension pH was then adjusted to the required value using NaOH or HCl.  No other 
chemical dispersants were added. 
Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the cross-flow 
electro-filtration unit.  The following operational conditions were evaluated: (1) clogging; (2) 
flux production; (3) quality of flux; and (4) backwash frequency.  The degree of filter clogging 
can be measured in terms of several properties including pressure drop and water quality of the 
filtrate, i.e. turbidity.  During the course of the filtration, the pressure of the system was 
monitored continuously.  Laboratory experiments were also run under the following conditions: 
(1) filtration rate; (2) particle concentration; (3) initial electrostatic field applied; (4) pH.  The 
filtration rate varied between 2.4 and 14.2 cm3/cm2-min.  The particle concentrations were from 
50 to 427 mg/L.  The electrostatic field strength applied was from 0 to 156.5 V/cm. 
Each experiment was run until both the turbidity readings in the filtrate and the concentrate 
streams reached a “steady state”  (for the sake of simplicity it was taken as the time when the 
turbidity was reduced by less than 2 % during a ten-minute period).  If the turbidity readings did 
not stabilize by this time, the experiment was continued until a steady flow rate in the filtrate 
stream was observed.  During the course of filtration experiments, samples were withdrawn 
periodically from the filtrate and the concentrate streams.  The pH and conductivity of water in 
the feed tank, the concentrate, and the filtrate streams were monitored during filtration.  The

Results and Discussion 
Particles and Characterization 
DLS results indicated that the average particle size (diameter) of γ-Al2O3 , Snowtex 20L 
(SiO2), Snowtex ZL (SiO2)  and naturally occurring colloids were 200, 76, 126 and 727 nm, 
respectively. Results also showed that the particle size distribution appeared to be monodispersed. 
Figure 2.3 shows the pH dependence of the zeta potential of γ-Al2O3, silica dioxide, and 
naturally occurring colloids.  Based on Figure 2.3, the pHzpc for γ-Al2O3 , Snowtex 20L (SiO2), 
Snowtex ZL (SiO2)  and naturally occurring colloids is approximately 9.2, 1.0, 2.0, and 1~2 
respectively.  Table 2.1 summarizes the characteristics of colloidal particles used in this study. 
 
Preliminary Assessment of the CFEF Unit 
Several variables on the performance of the filter unit were assessed using γ-Al2O3 as the 
surrogate colloidal particles and naturally occurring colloidal particles in terms of clogging, flux 
production, quality of flux, and backwash frequency. 
During the course of filtration, the pressure of the system was monitored constantly.  The 
initial pressures of inlet and outlet streams were controlled at 2 and 1 psi, respectively.  At the 
end of all experiments, pressure at inlet and outlet always remained at the same level.  To 
evaluate long-term clogging, filtration experiments were run continuously for two hours at a 
pump speed of 0.46 L/min) in the presence of γ-Al2O3 at concentration of 100 mg/L, initial pH of 
5.6 and electrostatic field strength of 96.8 V/cm.  The results showed no difference between the 
inlet and the outlet pressure. Throughout filtration experiments, the flux production varied from 
2.4 to 14.2 cm3/cm2-min. 
Quality of the flux improved significantly. At an influent solid concentration of 50 to 780 
mg/L, or an influent turbidity of 16 to 750 NTU, turbidity of the effluent (filtrate) was reduced to 
1 NTU as the maximum. Since no clogging was observed throughout the experiments, no 
backwash was performed under the experimental conditions studied. 
 
 
Effect of Filtration Rate 
The experiments were begun by adjusting the desired pumping speed, pH at 5.6, and a γ-Al2O3 
concentration of 100 mg/L, before applying an electrostatic field of 96.8 V/cm (or 300 voltage) 
 8
L/min and adjusted the electrostatic field strength to between 16.1 to 96.8 V/cm (or voltage 
between 50 to 300 V).   Figure 2.7 shows the removal efficiency of γ-Al2O3 under these 
conditions.  
The results show that the removal rate of γ-Al2O3 is fast during the first minute and that the 
removal efficiency increases with increasing electrostatic field (voltage).  The final removal 
efficiency was 23, 46, 60, 68, 72, and 80%, respectively, at 16.1, 32.3, 48.4, 64.5, 80.6, and 96.8 
V/cm (or 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 V) applied electrostatic field, respectively.  This almost 27-
fold increase demonstrates the potential of the process.   
For Snowtex ZL (Figure 2.8), the final removal efficiency was 3, 21, 60, 70, 93, 97 and 98%, 
respectively, at electrostatic field of 0, 32.3, 64.5, 96.8, 129.0, 161.3, and 187.7 V/cm (or 0, 100, 
200, 300, 400, 500, and 582V).  As expected, high electrostatic field will enhance the removal 
efficiency of particles. 
Figure 2.9 shows the effect of electrostatic field on the removal of naturally occurring 
colloids.  Because naturally occurring colloids are negatively charged at pH 6.6, the collector 
electrode was made cathodic.  Results indicate that the removal rate was fast during the first 4 
minutes (Figure 2.6).  After 3-min filtration time, the removal efficiency of naturally occurring 
colloids remained at the same level afterward.  The final removal efficiency was 7, 39, 62, 82, 93, 
95%, respectively, at electrostatic field of 0, 32.3, 64.5, 96.8, 129.1, and 156.5 V/cm (or 0, 100, 
200, 300, 400, 485V), respectively, for well water sample collected by the bailing method.  It is 
clear from Figure 2.8 that the mechanism of crossflow filtration is strongly dependent on the 
interaction of the electric field with charged colloidal particles.  High electrostatic field will 
enhance the removal efficiency of particles as expected. 
 
Effect of Solid Concentration 
The effect of total solid concentration at various electrostatic field values and various total solid 
concentrations (426 ~ 680 mg/L) for well water samples is shown in the Figures 2.10.  The final 
removal efficiency error was 0.7, 1.9, 1.6 and 0.8 %, respectively, at the electrostatic field of 0, 
32.3, 64.5 and 96.8 V/cm (0, 100, 200 and 300 V) for well water sample collected by the low-
flow-purging sampling at initial total solid concentration of 680 and 426 mg/L at a filtration time 
of 10 minutes.  The result shows that there is no distinct difference in removal efficiency at 
various total solid concentrations within the concentration range studied.

In the CFEF system, when the particles are traveling at the terminal velocity, vt, relative to the 
surrounding flow, where flow is moving at an opposite direction with velocity, vr, the resultant 
velocity of the particle relative to the fixed coordinate of the CFEF unit is: 
 pp t r r

v v v vπµ= − = −  (2.6) 
According to the mixed flow model, it can be assumed that the flow is completely mixed in the 
radial, r, and direction but not in the longitudinal, x, direction.  We then consider a section of 
cross-flow electro-filtration with length dx.  In this section the fraction of the particles that reach 
the collector electrode will be equal to the vertical distance an average particle falls due to 
electrostatic force in passing through the section, divided by the height of the section, which we 
may write as 
 pdrFraction collected
A
=  (2.7) 
where dr is the particle migration a distance, p is perimeter and A is total cross-sectional area. 
A particle, which enters the capture zone adjacent to the wall, will migrate a distance “dr” toward 
the wall while it moves a distance “dx” in the axial direction.  Since the time required for moving 
these two distances is identical, one has:

The change in number of particle passing this section is

Upon integration of equation (2.10), and under the following boundary conditions, i.e., N = Ni at 
x = 0 and allow vt to vary with x, the theoretical removal efficiency becomes:

occurring particles are in the range of 300 to 727 nm.  For γ-Al2O3, in the concentration range 
between 50 to 200 mg/L, there is no distinct difference in solid removal efficiency.  An optimal 
filtration rate is observed for the separation of colloidal particles.  At filtration rate greater or less  
than 0.46 L/min, the removal efficiency of γ-Al2O3 decreases as increasing or decreasing the 
filtration rate.  The results show that optimum filtration rate of the cross-flow electro-filtration 
unit is 0.3 L/min under the experimental conditions of 100 mg/L γ-Al2O3 and an electrostatic 
field of 96.8 V/cm.  The removal of γ-Al2O3 and naturally colloids was faster during the first 1 to 
4 minutes.  The removal efficiency increases with increasing electrostatic field or decreasing pH.  
The final removal efficiency of γ-Al2O3 at an electrostatic field of 96.8 V/cm is 80% at an γ-
Al2O3 concentration of 100 mg/L, pH 5.6, and filtration rate of 0.3 L/min.  The final removal 
efficiency of naturally occurring colloid was 95% at an electrostatic field of 156.5 V/cm, pH 6.6, 
and filtration rate of 0.3 L/min for well water sample collected by the bailing technique.  
Naturally occurring particles collected from groundwater samples and model colloidal silica 
(SiO2) particles were mixed to prepare a bimodal of particle size distribution.  Results indicate 
that the removal rate was fast during the first 3 minutes.  As expected, high electrostatic fields 
will enhance the particle removal efficiency.  According to the results, the proportion of larger 
particle size (i.e. naturally occurring particles) decreases as the electrostatic field strength 
increases.  On the other hand, the proportion of smaller particles (i.e. colloidal silica) increases as 
the electrostatic field of different strength increases.  Based on the results, we can successfully 
separate particles of different size using the CFEF module.  It is possible to separate the naturally 
occurring particles by adjusting applied field strength of the CFEF unit.
