英文摘要 
We have, for the first time, experimentally 
quantified the random dopant distribution induced 
threshold voltage (Vt) standard deviation up to 40 
mV for 20 nm-gate planar complementary 
metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors 
(CMOS). Discrete dopants have been statistically 
positioned in the three-dimensional (3D) channel 
region to examine associated carrier transportation 
characteristics, concurrently capturing “dopant 
concentration variation” and “dopant position 
fluctuation”. As gate length further scales down to 15 
nm, the newly developed discrete-dopant scheme 
features an effective solution to suppress 
3-sigma-edge single digit dopant induced Vt variation 
by gate work function modulation. The results of this 
study may postpone the scaling limit projected for 
planar CMOS.

二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
It is known that gate length scaling is still the 
most effective way to continue Moore’s Law for 
transistor density increase and chip performance 
enhancement [1-3]. However, as planar 
complementary metal-oxide- semiconductor field 
effect transistor (CMOS) advances to sub-20 nm 
gates, double-digit channel dopants make transistor 
behaviors more complicated to be characterized with 
conventional “continuum modeling”, due to every 
“discrete” dopant has its significant weight to impact 
the resulted transistor performance. Random nature 
of discrete dopant distribution results in significantly 
random fluctuations, such as the deviation of 
threshold voltage (Vt), drive current mismatch, and 
so on [3-14]. The fluctuation budget has to be 
controlled even tighter due to doubly increased 
transistor number along with technology node 
moving ahead. But unfortunately, the fluctuation is 
intrinsically increased with the scaling of transistor 
feature size, even not considering worsened short 
channel control [3]. 
Without loss of generality, the fluctuation can 
be decomposed into three components, one is 
resulting from the random dopant distribution (RDD) 
[3-8, 10-14] and the others are due to the mean gate 
distribution [3-8, 10-14] are the major variation 
sources of threshold voltage, we thus can extract 
RDD induced standard Vt deviation, RDDtV ,σ , from 
the following approximated equation as totaltV ,σ  
and LERGLDtV &,σ  can be directly measured from 
experimental data [3]:

totaltV ,σ  and extracted LERGLDtV &,σ , we can 
calculate RDDtV ,σ  according to Eq. (1).  We notice 
that for data with large σVt, the Ion-Ioff distribution 
is scattering. However, it still can be analyzed and 
well fitted by Eq. (1). σLg is obtained from SEM 
critical dimension measurements.

In this work, excellent short-channel-effect 
control down to 20 nm-gate has been experimentally 
realized with advanced shallow junction technology. 
We achieve junction depth around one half of gate 
length to maintain subthreshold leakage at 100 
nA/µm with channel doping ≈ 5E18 cm-3 and gate 
dielectric of 12Ao EOT (equivalent oxide thickness).  
Furthermore, to have the insights of 
random-dopants-distribution effects, quantum 
mechanical transport simulation is performed and 
compared with experimental data by solving a set of 
calibrated 3D density-gradient equation coupling 
with Poisson equation as well as electron-hole 
current continuity equations [11, 15-17].  The 3D 
device simulation was calibrated against the 
non-equilibrium green's function simulation for 
planar MOSFETs [17-19]. All statistically generated 
discrete dopants, as shown in Fig. 1 (details in next 
paragraph), are advanced and incorporated into the 
3D device simulation under our parallel computing 
system [16]. Such large-scale simulation approach 
allows us to explore the electrical characteristic 
fluctuations induced by randomness of dopant 
number and position in the channel region 
concurrently. The mobility model used in the device 
simulation, according to Mathiessen's rule [20, 21], 
can be expressed as:

two cases of channel doping with similar Ion but different Ioff; (c) 
and (d) represent two cases of channel doping with similar Ioff but 
different Ion.  The corresponding off-state (Vd = 1.0 V, Vg = 0.0 
V) potential contours and on-state (Vd = 1.0 V, Vg = 1.0 V) 
current density of (b), (c), and (d) are shown in the figures 7(b’), 
7(c’), 7(d’) and 7(b”), 7(c”), 7(d”), respectively. All 
cross-sectional figures of off-state potential contours and on-state 
current density distributions are extracted at 1nm below 12Ao 
EOT gate oxide. 
 
Figures 2 and 3 show the experimental Vt 
fluctuation and the on- and off-state currents’ (Ion-Ioff) 
characteristics of the n-typed MOSFETs 
(N-MOSFETs) down to 20nm gates. The Lg values 
in Fig. 2 are estimated from the gate capacitances in 
analysis data, and we presume the widths of all 
samples are 200 and 20 nm for 2(a) and 2(b), 
respectively. As expected, the Vt roll-off 
characteristics of 20 nm-wide devices are much more 
scattered than that of 200 nm-wide devices. The 
RDD induced Vt’s standard deviation, RDDtV ,σ , has 
then been experimentally extracted, as shown in Fig. 
4(a).  Discrete-dopant simulation for Lg = width (W) 
= 20 nm (data represented with symbol *, as shown 
in Fig. 4(a)) is in good agreement with the 
experimental data, which confirms the channel 
doping is randomly distributed as statistically 
modeled. As shown in figure 1, more than 100 cases 
are required for a set of Lg and width; we notice that 
each 3D simulation case may take about 3-7 days for 
final convergent result. Without loss of generality, 
due to the heavy computing resource, we select the 
most critical case (i.e., length = width = 20 nm) for 
comparison between simulation and measurement. 
Figure 4(b) shows the extracted LERGLDtV &,σ  of c 
and d conditions. The LERGLDtV &,σ  contains the 
contribution from the mean gate length deviation and 
the line edge roughness. In our experimental data, the 
LERGLDtV &,σ  increases as the (WL)-0.5 increased, and 
it has similar trend, compared with RDDtV ,σ . Table I 
summaries the corresponding parameters for all cases 
in Fig. 4. Figure 5(a) shows the extracted mobility 
versus the doping concentration from samples of the 
cases (a) and (b), as shown in Fig. 4(a). The used 
mobility model can generate mobility that is in good 
agreement with the extracted mobility, as shown in 
Fig. 5(a). The low-field electron mobility at 0.3 
MV/cm is greatly reduced with increasing doping 
concentration. That is why we limit our channel 
doping concentration at 5E18 cm-3, which 
corresponding to average 40 dopants in (20 nm)3 
cubes and 17 dopants in (15 nm)3 cubes, as shown in 
Figs. 1 and 8, respectively. Less channel doping 
concentration may reduce RDDtV ,σ , but channel 
dopants will quickly approach to single-digit number, 
as shown in Fig. 5(b).  Figures 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c) 
show Ion, Ioff, and Vt distributions versus channel 
dopants of these 125 cases. From the 
random-dopant-number point of view, the equivalent 
channel doping concentration increases when the 
dopant number increases, this substantially alters the 
threshold voltage and the on- and off-state currents, 
as shown in Figs. 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c), respectively. 
The random-dopant-position induced different 
fluctuation of characteristics in spite of the same 
number of dopants. Furthermore, the magnitude of 
the spread characteristics increases as the number of 
dopants increases. Figure 7(a) shows the Ion-Ioff 
characteristics of the 125 cases from Fig. 1. Figures 
7(b), 7(c), and 7(d) disclose 3 different 
 
Figure 10. Cross-sectional off-state electrostatic potential

dopants and ΦN = 4.05 eV, and (c) 7 dopants and ΦN = 4.22 eV; 
all at 1 nm below the gate oxide. 
 
四、 結論與討論 
Random dopant distribution induced tVσ  for 
20 nm-gate planar CMOS devices has been 
experimentally extracted and in good agreement with 
newly developed 3D discrete-dopant characterization. 
Average 40 dopants randomly distributed in the 
channel region give rise to RDDtV ,σ  of 40 mV. The 
developed scheme outlooks that 7 dopants under 15 
nm gate at 3σ  edge will occur and 8Ao EOT in 
addition to work-function-modulated metal gate can 
suppress the increase of the RDDtV ,σ  for realizing 
manufacture with such gate length scaling.
