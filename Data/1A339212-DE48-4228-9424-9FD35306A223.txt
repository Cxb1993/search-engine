1.基本原理 
參考圖 1 之系統，令一單自由度、單
位質量之系統以激振 f(t) 作用，則其運動
動方程式可以表示成：

d n( , ) ( )z f z z z f tω+ + =    (1) 
其中 ),(d zzf  代表阻尼函數，可以為線性或
非線性，ωn 為無阻尼之角頻率，f(t) 代表
單位質量之外界施加力函數，令該外界施
力為一諧波之週期函數，故方便說明起
見，可令該外界施力為： 
( ) sin( )f t F t= Ω   (2) 
式中之 Ω 為輸入激振訊號之角頻率。因
此，系統方程式(1)之解可以表示成

上式中 z0(t)為由起始條件所引起之系統自
由振盪反應，zp(t)則為外力反應。當系統穩
定後， )()( p tztz ≈ 會成立，但是另一方面，
由於外力是一諧波函數，則系統(1)對外所
之功應該可以由 (1)式等號左邊 (LHS)積
分；同時，它也應該剛好等於外界加到系
統之能量，而後者可以由(1)式之等號右邊
(RHS)積分，或

上式中之環積分代表對一完整之循環(或
2π)執行積分。(4)式 LHS 之積分中，由於
動能與應變位能在任一完整之循環中皆守
恆(conservative)，或其兩者之總作功和為
零，故(4)式 LHS，考慮單位弧度(radian)

其中之 T1為外力 f(t) 之週期，由於(4)式的
關係式成立，故(5)式之耗能 wd,z 應剛好等
於系統外所加入之能量。另一方面，由於
外力是一諧波函數，故系統之穩態反應 z(t)

Abstract—Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a kind 
of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which has relatively small 
scarring, short recovery time, and greater postoperative range of 
motion. UKA has therefore become the trend of arthroplasty in 
recent years, and it has been widely accepted by patients with 
unilateral joint damage. However, there are problems under the 
surging demands for UKA, such as the selection of patients, knee 
prostheses and surgical method. Because these factors have great 
impacts on the surgical outcomes, it is critical to explore the 
influence of unicompartmental knee prostheses (UKP) in various 
alignments. This study employs the finite element analysis (FEA) 
to evaluate the effects of UKP on the polyethylene (PE) 
components in various implant alignments, and thus provides 
further information for clinical practices. The results show that 
UKP has considerable impact upon the wear of the PE tibial 
components under conditions such as joints overuse, overweight 
or undercorrection of varus deformity. In addition, this study 
evaluates the angle after correction of the varus deformity, and 
results show that the angle should be less than 10°, otherwise the 
wear of the lateral side of the PE tibial components will increase 
and thus shorten the expectancy of joint protheses.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
UKA was developed in the early 1970’s [1]. According to 
documents, the outcomes were undesirable at that time due to 
poor design, inappropriate patient selection and misconception 
of the surgeons [2,3]. In recent years, however, the surgical 
outcome of UKA has greatly improved due to the advancement 
of prostheses design and material, as well as accumulation of 
surgical experience and appropriate patient selection. 
The principle of UKA technique is similar to total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA); however, they are not exactly the same. 
UKA preserves the anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL), the 
posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL), the medial/lateral meniscus 
and the undamaged joint surfaces while TKA removes all joint 
surfaces, ACL and PCL (according to the type of prosthesis) 
regardless of whether they are worn or not and completely 
reconstructs knee mobility and the surrounding tissue. Because 
TKA cannot completely restore the range of motion (ROM) of 
knee joint, UKA is superior with its more comprehensive ROM 
restoration [4,5]. However, the accuracy of UKA implantation 
is very critical for the balance of knee joint ligaments and the 
surrounding soft tissue. 
Because UKA is a kind of MIS, it is technically more 
difficult than TKA and there are more potential problems 
during the procedure [6], such as internal/external rotation, 
translation, varus/valgus tilt and tibial malresection. These 
problems may cause undesired outcomes in stability, mobility, 
wear and fixation of components. The excellent long-term 
results of UKA require coordination of multiple factors, 
including appropriate selection of patient and prostheses, as 
well as refined surgical techniques. Vardi and Strover [7] 
analyzed reports of cases that failed within one year after UKA 
and suggested that inappropriate patient selection and technical 
errors were the major causes of failure. 
Failure cases of UKA also show that the wear of PE 
components is the most common problem [3,7,8] and it is 
usually due to inappropriate correction of angle [5,6,9] and 
posterior tibial slope (PTS) [5,6]: overcorrection may cause 
wear of opposite tibiofemoral cartilage, while undercorrection 
may cause wear of PE tibial components. This indicates that 
the final angle corrected for knee deformity is the crucial factor

Figure 3. The max. contact stress on the PE tibial components of the two 
designs under the different varus tilt conditions for : (a) 5° and (b) 10° posterior 
tibial slopes. 
 
Fig. 2 reveals that under the same PTS, both brands’ the 
von Mises stress increases slightly with increasing VTA, and 
the effect of PTS is not significant. When PTS is 5° or 10°, the 
increase of the maximal von Mises stress when VTA increases 
from 0° to 10° is as follows: 4 % (PTS 5°) and 5.78 % (PTS 
10°) in ZUK; 3.8 % (PTS 5°) and 1.17 % (PTS 10°) in DUK. 
The rate of increase in stress is still mild. When VTA increases 
from 0° to 15°, the increase of the maximal von Mises stress is 
as follows: 8.2 % (PTS 5°) and 13.3 % (PTS 10°) in ZUK; 11.3 
% (PTS 5°) and 7.3 % (PTS 10°) in DUK. The above results 
reveal that when PTS is 5° or 10°, the rate of stress increase 
when VTA increases from 0° to 15° is more than twice as 
much as that from 0° to 10°. For both brands, the von Mises 
stress slightly exceeds the yield strength of the PE tibial 
components, and the value is higher at a 15° varus tilt. 
Fig. 3 reveals that the maximal contact stress generally 
increases with the increasing VTA, similar to those results in 
the study of the maximal von Mises stress. When varus tilt 
increases from 0° to 15°, VTA increases 26.1 % (PTS 5°) and 
34.3 % (PTS 10°) in ZUK, while 20.8 % (PTS 5°) and 9.5 % 
(PTS 10°) in DUK. The maximal contact stress of ZUK is 
higher than that of DUK, especially when varus tilt is 15°. 
Furthermore, the contact stress of ZUK is quite sensitive to 
changes of PTS: there is an interaction between PTS and VTA 
when PTS is 10° and VTA is 10° or 15°. In other words, VTA 
should be controlled under 10° when PTS is 10°; otherwise the 
maximal contact stress will increase significantly. DUK, 
however, doesn’t have the same phenomenon. 
We also found that the maximal stress of the PE tibial 
components shifts laterally with the increasing VTA, 
suggesting that when VTA exceeds 10° or when it is 
undercorrected, wear of the lateral side of the PE tibial 
components is more likely to occur, and thus leads to 
dislocation of the femoral components. This result is consistent 
with the revision case presented by Hernigou and Deschamps 
[17]. 
In summary, although PTS angle affects the stress of the PE 
tibial component, the effects of varus tilt is even more 
significant. Fig. 4 shows that the maximal von Mises stress of 
the PE tibial component occurs only beneath the contact 
surface of the tibial component, suggesting that the deformity 
of the PE tibial component first takes place inside the tibial 
component from bottom to top and then results in cracks or 
flakes. Furthermore, our study suggests that the maximal von 
Mises stress occurs closer to the contact surface of the PE tibial 
component while the maximal von Mises stress increases. This 
means the contact surface of the PE tibial component is more 
likely subjected to stress damage. 
 
Figure 4.  The max. von Mises stresses are located at the center of contact and 
occur approximately 2 mm beneath the articulating surface. 
IV. DISCUSSIONS 
According to the contact stress simulation demonstrated 
above, although the PE tibial components of DUK and ZUK 
differ in their geometric design and stress distribution under 
normal gait simulation, the stress both inside and on the contact 
surface of PE tibial components will exceed the yield strength 
of UHMWPE material and thus cause indentation, wear or tear 
of the PE components, regardless of the angle corrected for 
varus deformity. Therefore, accurate correction of varus 
deformity is as important as patient selection, such as body 
weight, for a successful surgery: to extend the expectancy of 
joint implants, avoid damage and dislocation of implant 
components, and reduce the need for a secondary replacement 
surgery. 
Generally speaking, the maximal von Mises stress and 
contact stress of the PE tibial components increase accordingly 
to the increasing PTS. However, when comparing different 
PTS under the same VTA, a larger PTS angle does not 
necessarily produce a higher stress value. This may arise from 
the conformity of the PE components in UKP; in other words, 
when the PTS angle gets larger, better conformity can be made 
between UKP components in order to reduce wear and damage 
of the PE tibial components. Nevertheless, a large PTS angle 
still causes increased stress on the PE tibial component. 
Hernigou and Deschamps [17] have reported that the patient 
with larger PTS angle has a higher probability of the PE tibial
