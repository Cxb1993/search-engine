英文摘要 
This part of project derives a semi-analytical solution for head distribution during constant-heat test at 
the partially penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer.  The constant-head boundary condition is used to 
describe the boundary along the screen while no-flow boundary condition is employed to describe the 
boundary along the casing of the well.  In addition, a free surface condition is utilized to delineate the upper 
boundary of the aquifer.  The Laplace domain solution is then derived using separation of variables and 
Laplace transform.  This solution can be used to identify the in-situ aquifer parameters from the data of 
constant-head test or to investigate the effects of vertical-flow caused by the partially penetration well and free 
surface boundary in an unconfined aquifer. 
Keywords: Unconfined aquifer, semi-analytical solution, partially penetrating well, constant-head test. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The aquifer tests including constant-head test (CHT) and constant-flux test (CFT) are usually performed 
to characterize an aquifer for estimating the aquifer parameters such as specific storage and hydraulic 
conductivity.   
In the past, many studies had been devoted to the solutions for CHT.  Kirkham (1959) derived a 
steady-state solution for groundwater distribution in a bounded confined aquifer pumped by a partially 
penetrating well under CHT.  They simplified the complexity of the geometry by dividing the model into two 
different regions.  Javandel and Zaghi (1975) considered the groundwater in a confined aquifer pumped by a 
fully penetrating well that is radially extended at the bottom of the aquifer.  The procedure used in their study 
is similar to that in Kirkham (1959) and the steady-state groundwater solution was obtained using separation 
of variables.   
Taking the finite-thickness skin into account, Yang and Yeh (2005) developed a time-domain solution for a 
CHT performed in a partially penetrating well.  The boundary conditions along the partially penetrating well 
is represented by a constant-head (first kind) boundary for the screen while a no-flow (second kind) boundary 
for the casing.  They transformed the first kind boundary along the screen into a second kind boundary with 
an unknown flux and therefore the boundary along the partially penetrating well became uniform.  The 
solution was then solved by the Laplace and finite Fourier cosine transforms.

英文摘要 
An anticline is a convex-upward fold of rock, which commonly forms during lateral compression.  The 
anticline aquifer is commonly selected as a potential site for underground waste storage or carbon 
sequestration.  A mathematical model is developed for describing the steady-state drawdown distribution in 
the anticline aquifer during the constant-flux pumping.  The topographical shape of the anticline is mimicked 
by three successive blocks.  The integral transform techniques including infinite Fourier transform and finite 
Fourier cosine transform are used to obtain the steady-state drawdown solution.  Simulated results indicate 
that a thin-limbs or narrow-ridged anticline would cause a much larger head drop near the well.  For a well 
of constant pumping rate, the dimensionless drawdown around the well increases with decreasing well screen 
length or/and aquifer anisotropy ratio.  The solution can be employed to identify the aquifer parameters and 
to design a potential site for waste disposal in the future.  
 
Keywords: anticline aquifer; constant-flux pumping test; partially penetrating well; anisotropy; integral 
transform 
1. Introduction 
An anticline is a convex-upward fold in rock due to lateral compression in crustal deformation.  A 
well-structured anticline formation may be considered as a potential site for waste disposal or carbon 
sequestration.  The flow patterns are expected to change with the anticline structure of aquifers as well as the 
injection or pumping of wastes or water in the aquifer.  Because of the movement of groundwater carries the 
contaminants, explicit information such as geological structure and hydrogeological data are necessary to 
judge the applicability of the potential storage sites or to predict the migration of the contaminant plume in the 
site.  Numerical or analytical approaches have been presented to investigate the head responses in anticline 
reservoirs due to the well injection or pumping.  Al-Mohannadi et al. (2007) used the finite-difference 
method to simulate the transient pressure responses to horizontal wells in anticline reservoirs.  Later, a 
steady-state solution proposed by Yeh and Kuo (2010) was used to simulate the flow for a constant-head 
injection via a fully penetrating well into a heterogeneous, anisotropic, and dome-like anticline reservoir.  
 The integral transform method is commonly adopted to obtain the hydraulic head or drawdown solutions 
for specific boundary conditions in the groundwater flow model.  For example, Chan et al. (1976) used the 
 10
being the volumetric pumping rate (L3T-1) and the well screen length; Dlz  represents the dimensionless 
screen length of the pumping well; U  and δ  are the unit step function and Dirac delta function, 
respectively.  The sink term in Eq. (1) implies that the flux through the screen is of uniform strength.

In Figure 2, we assume the cases of a fully penetrating well pumps at a dimensionless flow rate of DQ = 
1 in an isotropic anticline aquifer.  Figure 2a depicts the dimensionless drawdown in the Dx - Dz  plane for 
Dy = 0 when the anticline aquifer has the geometry 5.01 =PDax , 5.01 −=NDax , 12 =Dax , 13 −=Dax , and 
5.032 == DbDb zz .  The dimensionless drawdown contours intersect with the top and bottom impervious 
boundaries at right angles. The contours reveal that most of water flows horizontally around the well screen 
and in the limbs; however, conspicuous vertical flow appears around the concave corner of the top boundary.  
In zone 1, the dimensionless drawdown increases with Dz  because the flows from the recharge boundaries at 
1±=Dx  are restricted to pass through the upper zone 1 by the antiform of the aquifer.  Figures 2b and 2c 
examine two anticline aquifers of thin limbs ( 25.032 == DbDb zz ) and of narrow ridge ( 25.01 =PDax  and 
25.01 −=NDax ) by considering the aquifer portrayed in Figure 2a as a base case.  Both figures show that most 
of water flows horizontally in the zone around the well and in the limbs.  Significant vertical flow appears 
around the concave corner of the top boundary in the ridge zone due to the geometric variation.  In addition, 
the anticline aquifers with thin limbs or narrow ridge both cause a sharp head drop in the ridge zone in 
comparison with that of the base case at steady state. 
 
Figure 2. Dimensionless drawdown contours for the pumping at a fully penetrating well in isotropic anticline aquifers with different 
geometry. 
 
 
3.2 Effect of aquifer anisotropy and well partial penetration 
Figures 3a and 3b depict the dimensionless drawdown contours for the anisotropic cases of 3.0=zxκ  
and 3, respectively, and the dimensionless screen length of the partially penetrating well is 0.2.  In Figure 3a, 
the nearly horizontal contours in the ridge zone reflect the significant vertical flow across this region.  
Because of xk  is larger than zk  ( 3.0=zxκ ), most of flow goes through the horizontal path surrounding the 
well leading to the larger drawdown in the upper zone 1 (i.e., 18.0 <≤ Dz ).  The resultant hydraulic gradient 
as well as the boundary restriction causes an obvious vertical flow below this zone.  On the other hand, 
Figure 3b represents an unusual case of zk  being larger than xk  ( 3=zxκ ).  The flow in the limbs is mainly

Figure 5. Dimensionless drawdown contours for the pumping at a partially penetrating well with the dimensionless screen length of 
0.2.  The wells are located at (a) 0.10 =Dz  and (b) 2.00 =Dz  on the middle line of the anticline aquifer and (c) 8.00 =Dz  
at a dimensionless Dx  distance of 0.25 from the middle line of the anticline aquifer. 
 
3.3 Effect of well location 
Consider the dimensionless screen length of the well of 0.2, Figures 5a and 5b illustrate the flow patterns 
when the well located at the top-middle and bottom-middle of the aquifer, respectively.  Most of water flows 
horizontally in the limbs except in the zone near the concave corner of the top boundary.  Obviously upward 
and downward vertical flows occur in the aquifer as illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b, respectively, especially in 
the zone toward the extremity of the well.  Moreover, the present solution can simulate the dimensionless 
drawdown for an arbitrarily located pumping well in the ridge zone as shown in Figure 5c.  The figure shows 
an asymmetrical flow pattern affected by the well location and aquifer geometry.  Significant vertical flow 
appears in the ridge zone and in the right limb where Dx < 0.35.  In Figure 5, the well located at the 
top-middle of the aquifer has the largest dimensionless drawdown around the well.  
4. Concluding Remarks 
A mathematical model has been developed for describing the steady-state flow caused by the 
constant-flux pumping in an anticline aquifer.  The proposed model can account for the flow in response to 
partially or fully penetrating wells which are of infinitesimal diameter and with uniform inflow flux along the 
well screen.  The anticline aquifer is homogeneous, anisotropic and confined with a shape being mimicked 
by three consecutive blocks.  The integral transform techniques FT and FFCT are applied to derive the 
steady-state solutions in transform space.  The coefficients in the solutions require solving a system of linear 
equations represented in a matrix form.   
The present solution is used to investigate the influence of the aquifer geometry and anisotropy as well as 
the well partial penetration and location on the steady-state flow pattern.  The results shown in these cases 
exhibit significant vertical flow around the concave corner of the top boundary for a fully penetrating well or

的議題最大宗，其中降尺度問題是近兩年最熱的議題。此次水資源研討會，是獲得
研究方向及靈感來源的途徑，也是參加這次研討會最大收穫之一，可以從眾多學者
的報告中，吸收目前最新的研究議題與成果外，更可以繼續深入探討水資源與環境
問題，有待我們解決。雖然研習內容與學生專長不全然相同，但藉由這次的研習經
驗，帶回一些統計方法(stochastic、K-means、或其他統計模式)可能的應用。往後研
究可以切入到水資源或生態這一塊，應用統計方法將複雜性、多變性高的生態環境
問題，與地下水水位的牽制性，整合出兩者的相關性。 
學生在研習的過程中，三天內聽了 11 場，共計 36 位報告者的精闢演講，內容
非常廣泛，涉及到水資源的管理問題、設計問題、與工程問題。對於只有工程背景
而言，管理與設計相關問題，也相對重要，這也是未來需要廣泛涉獵的部份。因這
次赴國外出差研習，帶回來的資訊是，在水資源問題與氣候變遷，甚至是生態環境
部份，都有小小地啟發;因這個切入點，相信未來慢慢地會有研究突破與成果。 
 
三、建議 
1.大多數的研究論文都是以實際案例為研究契機，有了環境生態或工程問題，
再提出基礎假設和解決問題的方法。我們的研究則過於簡化和理想化，在學術理論
與實務應用上，還有些落差，這是我們未來選定研究主題時應注意的地方。 
2.參與國際的研討會，最大收穫是認識不同國家的學者，直接得知最新研究方
向、與第一手資訊，因此溝通能力與語言能力相對很重要，此次經歷更加能體會英
文表達的重要性，是國內學生普遍需加強的一環。 
3.國際性研討會通常天數較長，藉由研討會發表論文同時或是結束後舉辦短期

三種水層試驗部分貫穿井解析解之研究
Solutions for three aquifer tests involving partially penetrating
well
國立交通大學 葉弘德,張雅琪,陳彥如,陳庚轅
本計畫包含兩個部分：
『非侷限含水層中部分貫穿井於定水頭試驗下之地下水流分析』可用來探討部
分貫穿井在水層中所造成的垂直流問題，亦可利用試驗數據來推求水層的參數
。本解可應用的概念模式為非侷限含水層裡有一部分貫穿井作定水頭試驗，而
部分貫穿井濾管部分為定水頭邊界、盲管部分為不透水邊界，此外自由液面條
件為描述非侷限含水層的上邊界。
『定流量抽水試驗於背斜水層中之穩態解析解』可應用於背斜地層。背斜地層
是岩層受力彎曲後，形成向上拱起的褶皺地層。結構完整的背斜地層，可能作
為廢棄物地下貯存或二氧化碳封存的場所。本技術可用以描述定流量抽水試驗
到達穩態時，背斜水層內的洩降分佈，此外亦可應用於逆推背斜含水層的水文
地質參數值或做為廢棄物地下貯存場址篩選與設計的參考。
"Analysis of groundwater flow due to constant-head pumping from a
partially penetrating well in unconfined aquifers” can be used to
identify the in-situ aquifer parameters from the data of constant-
head test or to investigate the effects of vertical-flow caused by
the partially penetration well and free surface boundary in an
unconfined aquifer.
“A Steady-state solution for constant-flux pumping in an anticline
aquifer”can be employed to identify the aquifer parameters and to
design a potential site for waste disposal in the future
