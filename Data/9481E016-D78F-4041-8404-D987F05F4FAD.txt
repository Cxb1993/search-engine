pre-polymerized methylmethacrylate (PMMA) and initiator (benzoyl peroxide) and (2) liquid
portion including methylmethacrylate (MMA) monomer and promoter (N,
N-dimethyl-p-toluidine). When two portions are mixed, the initiation is activated by promoters
that make the free radicals (initiators). The free radicals react with monomers for polymerization
[1].
The bone cement fixation creates two interfaces: (1) bone/cement and (2) cement/implant. In
the current application of the bone cement used for anchoring femoral prostheses, it was reported
that 10% of the problems were related to the cement/implant interface and 11% to the
bone/cement interface [1]. In addition, one of the disadvantages of using PMMA as bone cement
is shrinkage of the bone cement during polymerization of MMA [2]. Shrinkage of bone cement
during polymerization may cause loss of load transfer through the interface between the bone and
bone cement and is a source of prosthetic loosening [3]. The typical shrinkage of the conventional
acrylate based bone cements is about 1~2%. Loosening is the failure of implantation. The other
disadvantage is the poor bonding to bone or prosthesis leading to prosthetic loosening [4, 5].
In our previous studies, cross-linked poly(methylmethacrylate-acrylic acid-
allylmethacrylate), denoted as poly(MMA-AA-AMA), was able to absorb body fluid and swell in
controlled manner. The swelling of the copolymer was constrained by the surrounding bone, and
consequently an interfacial pressure was developed at the bone-polymer interface. This interfacial
pressure, in turn, increased the frictional resistance and improved significantly the fixation
strength of the implants [6-11]. Thus cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) modified bone cement
could compensate the shrinkage of bone cement during polymerization. However, the absorbable
volume ratios of 80 ml / 20 ml / 10 ml and 70 ml / 30 ml / 10 ml separately with the initiator at
the amount of 0.4g/100 ml of the total mixture. MMA, AA and AMA were purchased from Kanto
Chemical Co. Inc. (Japan), Alfa Aesar (U.S.A.) and Acros Organics (U.S.A), respectively.
Polymerization was conducted in glass test tubes, which were tightly sealed and placed upright in
a temperature controlled water bath. The temperature was gradually raised (3?C/hr) over several
days to 65?C and kept at that temperature for two days. Then the glass tubes were removed from
the bath, allowed to cool and the polymer samples were retrieved after breaking the tubes. After
this primary polymerization stage was completed, the samples were post-cured to complete the
cross-linking reaction and to insure that there were no left free monomers. This was
accomplished by placing them in a temperature-controlled oven where the temperature was raised
slowly (1?C/min) up to 150?C. The samples were left at 150?C for a period of at least five hours
followed by overnight cooling. Then the cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) in bulk form was
dipped into 1M of sodium hydroxide solution for several days until full saturation followed by
washing with distilled water to fabricate cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA). The cross-linked
poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) was dried and washed alternatively for several times. Finally, the dried
cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) was ground into fine powder and sieved on a 140 mesh
screen.
Preparation of cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) modified bone cement
The commercial bone cement (Osteobond bone cement purchased from Zimmer, Inc.) was
used as well in this study. The content of the commercial bone cement provided by the supplier is
cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) modified bone cement systems is based on MMA/acrylic
acid (AA)/AMA.
Analysis
The chemical characterization of the sample was performed by Fourier-transform infra-red
spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum one). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was
performed with Thermogravimetric Analyzer (PerkinElmer, PYRIS 1 TGA) under air flow at a
heating rate of 20?C/min. The dynamic mechanical properties of the bone cements were
measured using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA 2980, TA Instruments), with the clamp of
single cantilever. The dimensions of the rectangular specimens for DMA were 35×11×2.7 mm3.
The measuring temperatures ranged from 25 to 150°C at 3°C/min, and the frequencies swept at 1,
3, 5, and 10 Hz. For sinusoidal oscillations, tan δ= E”/E’, where E”is loss modulus and E’is
elastic modulus [13]. From the variation of tan δwith temperature, there was a peak
corresponding to ?-transition. The?-transition corresponded to the glass transition of bone
cement [14].
Swelling Measurement
Swelling measurements (described here as percentage weight changes) were carried out on
the commercial bone cement and the modified bone cement containing MMA/AAS/AMA or
MMA/AA/AMA at various ratios. Five specimens of each systems were fully immersed in saline
solution (0.9% NaCl solution obtained from Otsuka Taiwan) and kept at 37?C for 1200 hours.
carboxylic acid and ester are 1710 - 1780 cm-1 and 1750 - 1735 cm-1, respectively. The absorption
peak of carbonyl group in both cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) and cross-linked
poly(MMA-AA-AMA) powder was about 1738 cm-1 (Peak 1 in Figure 1). The wavenumbers of
the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations attributed to the carboxylate anion are
around 1570 - 1550 cm-1 (strong) and around 1420 - 1400 cm-1 (weak) [16, 17]. Rufino and
Monteiro show that the wavenumber of asymmetric stretching vibration for sodium salts of
poly(methacrylic acid) is 1566 cm-1 [18]. Hadzija and Spoljar determined the infrared
spectroscopy of COO- antisymmetric stretch vibration at 1580 cm–1 [19]. In this study, the
wavenumbers of the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations for carboxylate anion of
cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) were 1586 cm-1 and 1407 cm-1 (Peaks 2 and 3 in Figure 1),
respectively. The cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) did not show these peaks, because of no
carboxylate ion existed in the cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA).
Figure 2 represents the mass loss of the bone cements observed by TGA. The measured
thermal degradation temperatures (Td at 90% and 50%) of the bone cements are summarized in
Table 3. For the all cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) modified bone cements, the Td at 90%
were lower than that of the commercial bone cement. The more content of cross-linked
poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) powder in the modified bone cement exhibited lower Td at 90%,
because the cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) might still contain a small amount of H2O
resulted from the conversion from cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) to cross-linked
poly(MMA-AAS-AMA). However, the Td at 50% of the commercial bone cement was lower than
that of the all cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) modified bone cement. The more content of
Tg involved segmental motion in polymer. As the frequency increases the relaxation associated
with the Tg could only occurred at higher temperatures.
Figure 5 is the swelling measurements of the cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA)
modified bone cement systems in saline solution at 37?C for 1200 hours. The more cross-linked
poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) powder in the modified bone cement resulted in a higher weight gain.
The absorption of water was mainly contributed by the portion of acrylic acid sodium salt. Figure
6 is the swelling measurements of the cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) modified bone cement
systems in saline solution at 37°C for 1200 hours. The weight gain percentages and swelling rates
of the cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) modified bone cement systems was much higher
than those of the cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) modified bone cement systems. It was due
to the contribution of acrylic acid sodium salt in the modified bone cement. Acrylic acid sodium
salt (AAS) was considered to possess anionic and cationic charges leading to better ability to
absorb water than acrylic acid (AA). Once the outer shell of bone cement swelled, water
penetrated easily the inner core of the modified bone cement. Thus the swelling rate of the
modified bone cement was also improved. In Figure 5, System 70-17-S had less weight gain than
System 80-17-S. The reason was that System 70-17-S in the beginning contained more H2O than
System 80-17-S did. This could be confirmed again by TGA in Figure 2, where System 70-17-S
had larger weight loss than System 80-17-S at around 100?C. System 70-19-S also showed less
weight gain than System 80-19-S. In Figure 6, System 70-17 had higher weight gain than System
80-17 and System 70-19 had higher weight gain than System 80-19. It was caused by the more
component of acrylic acid (AA) in the cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) modified bone
bone cement. In dynamic mechanical analysis, the excessive content of poly(MMA-AAS-AMA)
lowered the stiffness of the modified bone cement, because of water existed in
poly(MMA-AAS-AMA). The glass transition temperature of the bone cement shifted to higher
temperature at higher frequency due to viscoelasticity. For swelling measurement, the weight gain
percentage and swelling rate of cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) modified bone cement
systems were much higher than those of cross-linked poly(MMA-AA-AMA) modified bone
cement systems. The proper content of cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) in bone cement was
able to swell. The excess of cross-linked poly(MMA-AAS-AMA) could lower the mechanical
properties of the modified bone cement.

Abstract
Bone cement is used as filler between prosthesis and bone for fixation and force distribution.
The major composition of bone cement is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Some disadvantages
of PMMA bone cement are found such as significant poor mechanical properties which may cause
failure of the cement. In this paper, we exploited carbon nanotube to enhance the mechanical
properties of bone cement. The mechanical properties of the bone cement were characterized using
tensile and compressive analysis as well as dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The result shows
that carbon nanotube is able to enhance the mechanical properties of the modified bone cement.
Key words: bone cement, PMMA, carbon nanotube
modulus of the composites is significantly increased [6]. Stephan et al. prepared poly(methyl
methacrylate)-singlewalled carbon nanotube composites by solution mixing [7]. Cooper et al. used
a polymer extrusion technique to prepare carbon nanotube mixed in a poly(methyl methacrylate)
matrix and found that the impact strength was significantly improved by even small amounts of
single-wall nanotube [8]. Jia et al. prepared poly(methyl methacrylate)/carbon nanotube composites
by an in situ process. Their studies show that carbon nanotube can participate in the polymerization
of PMMA initiated by AIBN and form a strong combining interface between the carbon nanotube
and the PMMA matrix [9].
The purpose of this study is to enhance the mechanical properties of bone cement with carbon
nanotube. In this study, the various systems of bone cement reinforced with carbon nanotube were
fabricated. The mechanical properties of bone cement were characterized using tensile as well as
compressive analysis and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The results show that introduction
of carbon nanotube is able to enhance the mechanical properties of bone cement.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Preparation of PMMA/carbon nanotube powder
Carbon nanotube (CNT) (40 ~ 60 nm in diameter, 0.5 ~ 40 mm in length) was purchased from
The tensile and compressive strength of bone cement was characterized using INSTRON 5582.
The specimens for tensile analysis are referred to the work of Harper and Bonfield [10]. The
specimens have the dimensions: 75 mm in length, 5 mm in width, approximately 3.5 mm in
thickness, with a gauge length of 25 mm. The crosshead speed employed was 5 mm/min. The
compressive analysis of bone cement corresponded to ASTM F451. The crosshead speed was 25
mm/min. The diameter and length of the specimens were 6.0 mm and 12.5 mm, respectively.
The dynamic mechanical properties of bone cements were measured using dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA 2980, TA Instruments), with the clamp of single cantilever. The
dimensions of the rectangular specimens for DMA were 35×11×2.7 mm3. The measuring
temperatures ranged from 25 to 150°C at 3°C/min, and the frequencies swept at 1, 3, 5, and 10 Hz.
The glass transition temperature of a sample was labeled using the tan δpeak, which occurs at the
highest temperature.
3. Results and discussion
Table 3 shows the tensile and compressive strength of the bone cements tested in this study.
System 1 is a commercial product which has tensile strength and compressive strength of 40.49
MPa and 105.33 MPa, respectively. Systems 2 to 7 are the bone cements containing carbon
In order to achieve better dispersion of carbon nanotube in bone cement, we first fabricated
PMMA/CNT composites and then ground them as powder form to be introduced into bone cement.
This kind of modified bone cement exhibits excellent material properties such as tensile and
compressive strength. The results show potential usage in clinical applications.
