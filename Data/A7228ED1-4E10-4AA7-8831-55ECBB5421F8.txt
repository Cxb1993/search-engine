Abstract 
Ordered TiO2 and TiO2/SiO2 photocatalyts with controllable pore wall thickness were 
successfully prepared using a templating sol-gel and non-hydrolytic sol-gel methods.  In 
addition, the photocatalytic activity of the two porous materials were systematically examined 
and elucidated in terms of microstructures and charge carrier generation and recombination.  
Polystyrene microspheres with diameter of 190 nm were used as the templates and they were 
removed from metal oxide matrix by calcination at 550 °C in air.  Concentration of TiO2 
precursors dominates the pore wall thickness and macropore sizes.  Wall thickness of the porous 
TiO2 increased from 33 to 41 nm, while the averaged pore diameters increased from 133 to 149 
nm as TTIP/isopropanol weight ratio increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  Concentrate TiO2 precursor 
solutions exhibited high capability to stabilize the porous structures against thermal induced 
shrinkage.  Irrespective of the pore structure, anatase TiO2 with the crystallite sizes ranged 
9.3-10.8 nm was obtained after calcination.  Thicknesses of TiO2 ultrathin films were also 
controlled by precursor concentration and increased from 4.6 to 9.4 nm as the TTIP/isopropanol 
weight ratio increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  Crystallite sizes of the TiO2 films were 4.6-8.7 nm, 
which were similar to their film thicknesses.  Porous TiO2 showed specific surface area of 65-79 
m2/g, while larger values ranged 410-535 m2/g were obtained in porous TiO2/SiO2.  Bandgaps of 
the porous photocatalysts were 3.5-3.6 eV, indicating quantum size effects.  Porous TiO2 
exhibited the apparent rate constants for decomposition of RhB in the range of 8.7× 10-2- 2.9× 
10-1 min-1 and surface photocatalytic activity in the range of 1.1× 10-3- 4.0× 10-3 min-1•m-2 •mg, 
and intrinsic photoactivities of 7.3× 10-3- 2.0× 10-2 min-1•mg-1.  Optimal wall thickness of the 
porous TiO2 was 142 nm.  TiO2 thin films showed apparent rate constants in the range of 3.3× 
10-3- 1.3 × 10-2 min-1, surface photoactivity of 1.6× 10-4- 3.2× 10-4 min-1•m-2 •mg, and intrinsic 
photoactivities of 2.9× 10-2- 3.6× 10-2 min-1•mg-1.  Porous TiO2 performed high surface activity 
because of integrated numbers of charge carriers, while few boundary recombinations resulted in 
superior intrinsic photoactivity of TiO2 ultrathin films.

Introduction 
Titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based photocatalysis has been developed as the promising 
advanced oxidation process for efficiently decomposition of environmental organic pollutants.  
To improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, many efforts have been devoted on preparation 
of porous structures or nanoparticles to provide large reactive surface area for catalysis.  In 
addition to increased numbers of reaction sites, nanosized TiO2 exhibits many specialties on its 
physicochemical properties which are different from those in the bulk and are beneficial for 
photocatalytic activity.  Such effects include increased surface energy, extended redox ability 
and maximized quantities of effective charge carriers because of increased surface density of 
defects, broadening bandgaps, and optimal charge diffusion length. 
Templating methods accompanied with sol-gel or hydrothermal processes are commonly 
used manners for preparation of porous TiO2.  Templates can be categorized into two organic 
and inorganic types.  Organic templates includes polystyrene (PS), polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA), block-coplymers and anionic or cationic surfactants, while inorganic templates contain 
silica or carbons.1-3  These templates are added into the precursor solutions and then removed 
after gelation of metal oxides by calcination or washing with HF.  Cavities with similar sizes 
and shapes to those of templates are introduced into the bulk structure of metal oxides and result 
in porous structures.  The surface area of the porous TiO2 can reach to 80-712 m2/g and the 
porosity increases to 60 %.4-6  Microstructures as well as crystalline properties of porous TiO2 
highly depend on precursor concentrations, sizes of templates and post-thermal treatment.  
However, well controlled porous structure is difficult to be obtained because of high hydrolysis 
rate of TiO2.  In addition, the thermal stability of porous TiO2 decreases with increasing 
temperature.  Calcination is used not only for removal of templates but also for crystallization of 
TiO2 for higher photocatalytic activity.  However, thermal induced shrinkage of TiO2 results in 
severe distortion of microstructures and dramatically decreases the surface area because of 
collapse of the porous skeletons.  To overcome these drawbacks, dispersing TiO2 nanocrystals 
or coating thin films onto porous supports attract large attentions.                    
Monodispersed TiO2 nanocrystals have been prepared either by a non-hydrolytic sol-gel or 
 3
and supported TiO2 films on photocatalytic activities have not been addressed yet.                       
In this study, we aim to systematically investigate the photocatalytic activity of porous TiO2 
and ultrathin TiO2 films on porous SiO2 support with respect to the microstructures, surface area, 
and charge recombinations.  Order macroporous TiO2 and SiO2 were prepared using a 
templating sol-gel method in which three-dimensional polystyrene colloidal crystals were used as 
the templates.  TiO2 ultra-thin films were coated onto porous SiO2 to form skin-bone like 
structure using a surface sol-gel method.  The film thickness of the coated TiO2 was controlled 
by adjusting precursor-to-solvent ratios.             
 
Experimental section 
Chemicals.  Styrene (C8H8, GC, ＞99 %), potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, 99 %) and titanium 
isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 , 99.999 %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. 
(St. Louis, USA).  Sodium dodecyl sulfate (C12H25NaO4S, ＞99%) was obtained from Merck 
Co. Inc.(Dortmund, Germany).  Isopropanol (CH3CHOHCH3) was purchased from J. T. Baker 
Co. (New Jersey, USA).  Hydrochloric acid (HCl, ＞35 %, D= 1.2 g/cm3) was purchased from 
Crown Guaranteed Reagents.  The precursor of SiO2, tetraethyl orthosilicate ((C2H5O)4Si, TEOS, 
≧99 %) was obtained from Fluka Co. Inc., (Tokyo, Japan). Polyoxyethylenesorbitan 
monolaurate (Tween 20) and Rhodamine B (C28H31ClN2O3, ~95 %) were also purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.  Degussa P25 TiO2 powders were provided by Degussa 
Corporation, Germany. 
 
Synthesis of polystyrene microspheres.  Monodispersed polystyrene (PS) microspheres were 
prepared by oil-in-water emulsion polymerization.15  The polymerization was carried out in a 50 
ml round bottom flask equipped with a water-cooled reflux condenser.  Initially, 39 ml of water 
was added into the flask.  The water was then purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes with 
vigorously stirring at 350 rpm to maintain an anoxic condition.  Various amounts of sodium 
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were dissolved into the anoxic water to reach the concentrations ranged 
0.5-2 CMC.  Styrene (1.4 mol l-1) served as the monomer was then added into the mixtures and 
 5
weight ratio of 2.3: 1.0: 1.5.  The 0.25 ml TiO2 (or 0.50 ml SiO2) precursor solutions were 
introduced into the cavities of the latex arrays by gravitational accompanied with capillary forces.  
Figure 3-4 showed the addition of precursor solution to the template of the precursor of titania 
and 0.5 ml of the precursor of silica were added to the templates respectively.  The 
template/metal oxide composites were dried at 30 °C and then calcined at 500 °C in air for 3 
hours.

Coating ultra-thin TiO2 films onto porous SiO2.  The bone-skin-like structures were obtained 
by coating TiO2 thin films (as skin) onto ordered porous SiO2 (as a backbone) using a surface 
sol-gel method.  Preparation of precursor solutions of TiO2 were similar to that used in 
 7
a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi 3010) operated by a reflectance mode (%R) and scanning 
from 800 to 190 nm.  All the spectra were referenced to that of Al2O3 taking 100 % reflection.  
The reflectances were then converted to absorptions using Kubelka-Munk formula.  Nitrogen 
adsorption isotherm was measured at 77 K using a N2 adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 
2020). The Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) and Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) models 
were used to estimate the surface area and pore volume of the thin films according to the N2 
adsorption isotherm.   
 
Results and discussion 
Preparation of Polystyrene Microspheres.  Figure 3 shows the SEM images of polystyrene 
microspheres prepared under different concentrations of SDS and preparation temperatures.  
Monodispersed polystyrene microspheres were obtained when initiator was introduced into the 
solution preheated at 70 °C.  In contrast, polymerization induced under elevated temperature 
resulted in significant coagulation.  Although isolation of polystyrene particles was obtained 
from prompt polymerization at 70 °C, particle shapes varied significantly.  Uniform sizes of 
polystyrene microspheres with diameter of 190 nm were produced at 80 °C.  As the temperature 
further increased to 90 °C, wide size distribution of the particle sizes were resulted.  Changes in 
concentration of SDS also altered the particle morphology.  At 70 °C, spherical polystyrene 
particles with diameters of 270 nm were generated when the concentration of SDS was 0.5 CMC.  
AS the concentrations of SDS increased to 2 CMC, particles with irregular sizes and shapes were 
resulted.   
The shapes of micelles and formation rate of the free radicals dominate the morphology and 
particle size of polystyrene in the emulsion polymerization process and they are greatly 
dependent on concentration of surfactants and heating history during preparation.  According to 
Lamer’s diagram, formation of particles from solutions involves three stages including 
pre-nucleation, nucleation, and growth.  Monodispersed particles with uniform sizes were 
produced when nucleation stage could be separated from growth.  High temperature releases 
large quantity of free radicals thus promotes quick formation of microspheres and simultaneous

Morphology of Porous TiO2, SiO2 and skin-bone-like TiO2/SiO2.  Porous metal oxides were 
prepared by infiltration of the void of polystyrene 3D colloidal crystals with sol solutions of 
metal oxides followed by removal of the polystyrene microspheres via calcination.  To 
understand the effect of sol-gel kinetics on the microstructures of the porous metal oxides, the sol 
solution with different metal alkoxide/solvent weight ratios were used for the sample preparation.  
Figure 4 shows the TEM and SEM images of the porous TiO2 prepared by the sol solutions with 
the TTIP/isopropanol weight ratios of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.2.  The TEM and SEM images indicate that 
the TiO2 consist of ordered hexagonal porous structures in three dimensions.  Table 1 lists the 
wall thickness, pore sizes and shrinkages of the porous TiO2 and porous SiO2/TiO2.  The wall 
thickness of porous TiO2 increased from 33 to 42 nm when the TTIP/isopropanol weight ratios 
increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  This result indicates that the concentration of precursor in the sol 
solution dominates the wall thickness of the porous TiO2.  Moreover, the thicker wall obtained 
from more concentrated sol solution is probably due to high viscosity.  Viscous sol solutions 
poorly penetrate the colloidal crystal templates so that expand the space between PS 
microspheres.  The high viscosity of concentrated sol solutions has been demonstrated in many 
literatures.  The pore sizes of the porous TiO2 were ranged from 133 to 149 nm with increasing

of metal alkoxide/solvent of 0.2 (A, D), 0.6 (B, E) and 1.2 (C, F). 
 
The bone-skin-like structure was obtained by coating titania films onto the ordered porous 
silica using surface sol-gel method.  The preparation of porous silica is similar to that of porous 
TiO2.  Figure 5 shows the TEM and SEM images of porous SiO2 and bone-skin-like SiO2/TiO2.  
The SiO2 also maintains ordered hexagonal porous structures in three dimensions.  The wall 
thickness of porous SiO2 is about 9.2 nm and observably thinner than that of porous TiO2.  The 
pore diameter is about 170 nm indicating the 11 % shrinkage of the pore wall structure.   
After coating TiO2 on the surface of porous SiO2, the wall thickness ranged 13.9 to 18.6 nm 
was obtained.  The thicker and uniform wall thicknesses of SiO2/TiO2 samples clearly indicate 
that the TiO2 thin films are successfully coated onto the porous SiO2 as bone-skin-like porous 
structures.  The film thickness of sol-gel-derived TiO2 increased from 4.6 to 9.4 nm when the 
TTIP/isopropanol weight ratios increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  This result indicates that the 
concentration of precursor in the sol solution dominates the TiO2 film thickness.  Moreover, 
thinner films of TiO2 can be formed using the surface sol-gel method.

Table 2 lists the specific surface area, average mesopore diameter, and pore volume of the porous 
materials.  According to the amounts of adsorbed N2 at P/P0 of 0.05-0.35 and BET model, the 
specific surface area of the porous TiO2 ranged 79 and 65 m2/g.  In addition, the surface area 
slightly decreased with increasing precursor concentrations.  This phenomenon is as the result of 
thicker pore wall and larger pore sizes obtained at higher precursor concentrations.  Porous SiO2 
exhibited a specific surface area of 508 m2/g.  This value was remarkably larger than the 
specific surface areas of the porous TiO2 because of lower density of SiO2 (2.2 g/cm3) than that of 
TiO2 (4.0 g/cm3).  After coating with TiO2, the TiO2/SiO2 porous materials showed the specific 
surface area of 411-535 m2/g.  Hysteresis on the desorption isotherms of theses porous materials 
indicates the existence of mesopores which are resulted from uncompleted condensations.17,18  It 
is noted that the surface area of porous SiO2/TiO2 at TTIP/iropropanol of 0.2 was even higher 
than that of porous SiO2.  In addition, the mesopore size of SiO2 decreased from 6.6 to 3.0 nm 
and pore volume increased from 0.38 to 0.42 after coating of the TiO2 films.  Mesopores 
resulted from coagulations of TiO2 nanoparticels contribute to the increased surface area.  The 
surface area of the porous SiO2/TiO2 decreased with increasing precursor concentration because 
higher loading of TiO2.

Microstructures and bandgaps.   Calcination not only removes the PS templates but also 
crystallizes the TiO2.  Figure 7 shows the XRD patterns of porous TiO2 and TiO2/SiO2 calcined 
at 500 °C in air.  Pure anatase form was obtained in all the porous TiO2.  The crystallite sizes 
of were calculated from the broadening of the deflection peaks using Schererr equation and the 
results were summarized in Table 3.  The crystallite sizes of the porous TiO2 increased from 9.3 
to 10.8 nm as the weight ratio increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  The crystallite sizes were smaller than 
the wall thickness of the TiO2 (42-58 nm), indicating that the porous TiO2 is polymorph.  
The sol-gel-derived porous silica was amorphous after the calcination.  All the TiO2 in the 
skin-bone-like structures exhibited anatase form.  The crystallite sizes increased from 4.6 to 8.7 
nm as the weight ratio increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  Figure 8 shows the HRTEM images of 
skin-bone-like TiO2/SiO2 prepared by different TTIP/isopropanol weight ratios.  The HRTEM 
images show that crystallite sizes range from 4.00 to 9.06 nm which are close to those obtained 
from XRD.  Moreover, the surface sol-gel coated films grow preferentially along anatase (101) 
plane that is parallel to SiO2 substrate.

Photoactivities activities.  To understand the effect of different microstructures on the 
 21
This finding indicates that integrated numbers of charge carrier dominates the surface reactivity 
rather than bulk recombinations.      
To understand the effect of charge recombination on the photocatalytic activity, we 
normalized the apparent rate constants by total mass of TiO2 in each batch system.  The masses 
of TiO2 in skin-bone-like structures were analyzed by ICP-MS and the results were summarized 
in Table 6.  The real mass of coated titania increased from 2.3 to 4.5 mg when the 
TTIP/isopropanol weight ratio increased from 0.2 to 1.2.  After normalization of the apparent 
rate constants with TiO2 contents, the TiO2 film at TTIP/isopropanol of 0.2 showed the highest 
intrinsic photocatalytic activity of 3.6× 10-2 min-1mg-1.  The activity decreased slightly with 
increasing concentration of TTIP and the lowest one (2.9 × 10-2 min-1mg-1) took place at the 
weight ratio of 1.2.  The thinnest TiO2 film (thickness is 4.6 nm) at weight ratio of 0.2 has short 
charge diffusion length and low bulk defects thus fewer charge recombination is resulted. In 
contrast, porous TiO2 was composed of polymorph structures with high quantities of defects in 
grain boundaries.  The defects act as the charge recombination centers and reduce the 
photon-to-current conversion efficiency as well as intrinsic photoactivities.20

Conclusions 
In this study, we combined templating sol-gel and non-hydrolytic sol-gel method to prepare 
ordered porous TiO2 and TiO2/SiO2 skin-bone-like photocatalysts.  Concentrations of precursor 
solutions dominate the thickness of pore wall and TiO2 ultrathin films and pore sizes.  Higher 
viscosity and faster condensation in more concentrated sol solution result in more compact and 
thicker pore wall in porous TiO2.  Thus, thermal induced shrinkage of pore structures was 
inhibited.  On the other hand, ultrathin TiO2 films were successfully prepared by coating 
precursor solution followed by hydrolysis on the surface.  The thicknesses of the ultrathin films 
were close to their crystallize sizes.  The porous TiO2 exhibited higher surface photocatalytic 
activity than ultrathin TiO2 films.  In contrast, the ultrathin films showed superior intrinsic 
photocatalytic activity.  Accumulation of charge carriers in the porous TiO2 dominates the high 
surface activity.  In addition, the critical pore wall thickness was 142 nm.  Charge 
recombination was inhibited in the TiO2 ultrathin films because of nearly single crystalline

Abstract 
Surface modification of TiO2 with organic compounds has been proved to greatly enhance its 
photocatalytic activity because of improved adsorption of organic pollutants.  In this study, we develop a 
facile method for preparation of salicylic acid modified TiO2 by microwave irradiation of Degussa P25 in the 
presence of the organic compound.  The FTIR spectrum of the modified TiO2 (ST0593) clearly shows the 
absorption band of COO-Ti at 1621-1697 cm-1 after microwave irradiation, indicating that microwave 
induces bonding of salicylic acid to TiO2 in terms of esterization, complexation and static charge interaction.  
Compared to the modified TiO2 only with hydrogen bonding or complexation, microwave-treated modified 
TiO2 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity because three types of bonding lead to synergetic effects.       
The optimal microwave condition for the highest photoactivity is at 1/0.5 of TiO2-Organic molar ratio, 90°C 
of heating temperature and 30 min of reaction time.  Under this condition, the salicylic acid modified TiO2 
performs 1.6 times higher photoactivity than Degussa P25.

microwave irradiation of Degussa P25 in the presence of the organic compound.  The 
physicochemical properties of the modified TiO2 and its photocatalytic activity for dye degradation 
were investigated.  Moreover, an optimal microwave condition for highest photocatalytic activity 
was determined and discussed based on the surface properties. 
 
2. Experimental 
2-1 Materials 
Commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) was selected as the substrate for surface modification because it 
is the wildly studied and well known photocatalyst with high photocatalytic activity.  Degussa P25 
has a specific surface area of 50 m2/g and it is composed of 80 % anatase and 20 % rutile.  Salicylic 
acid (99.8 %) used as the modifier was purchased from J.T.Backer.  Ethanol (99.8%) and 
hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35%) were purchased from Riedel-deHaen and Crown Guaranteed Reagents, 
respectively.  Rhodamine B (C28H31ClN2O3, 95%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. 
 
2-2 Sample preparation 
Organic compound was bonded to the TiO2 under irradiation of microwave (MARS, frequency 
2.45× 109 HZ, power 1200W, pressure 150 psi).  In order to investigate the effect of the microwave 
conditions on photocatalytic activity, we adjusted microwave temperature (90 and 150 °C) and 
microwave time (30 and 60 min) in different batch preparation systems.  Figure 1 shows the 
preparation process of the surface modification TiO2.  Firstly, salicylic acid was mixed with TiO2 
(P25) at different TiO2-Organic molar ratios (1/0.3, 1/0.5 and 1/1).  Then, the mixtures were 
suspended in the solutions containing 1 ml ethanol (99.5%) and 9 ml 1M HCl in Teflon vessels.  
After irradiation of microwave, the products were washed with D.I. water and acetone for two times 
for removal of physic adsorbed salicylic acid.  The sample was harvested by centrifugation at 11000 
rpm for 6 min.  Finally, sample was dried and ground into fine TiO2 powder.  Table 1 lists the 
experiment conditions of each sample.  The sample is named as STxyz, where S is salicylic acid, T is 
TiO2, x represents the TiO2-Organic molar ratios, y is the microwave temperature in °C, z is the 
microwave time in min.

using UV-vis spectrometer (HITACHI U-3010).  Reflectance (%R) results are translated to 
absorbance by the Kubelka-Munk formula.  The specific surface area was determined according to 
the Brunauer-Emment-Teller (BET) method. 
The crystal structure and grain size were examined by X-ray Diffractometer (XRD, MAC 
Sience，MXP-18) using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å).  The operating conditions are at an emission 
voltage of 30 kV and an emission current of 20 mA.  XRD patterns were obtained between 20 and 
80 2θ range at sample width of 0.02o with scan speed of 4o/min.  Surface chemical compositions 
were determined by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Physical Electronics, ESCA PHI 
1600) using an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). 
 
2-4 Photocatalytic activity  
The photocatalytic activity of the modified TiO2 was evaluated by the decomposition of 
Rhodamine B (RhB) in an aqueous solution.  The sample catalyst of 0.015 g was dispersed into 15 
mL of aqueous RhB solution with a concentration of 0.2 mM.  The solution was mixed continuously 
with a magnetic stirrer during the reaction.  Firstly, the solution mixture was stirred for 30 min 
without irradiation in order to ensure the establishment of an adsorption-desorption equilibrium 
among the photocatalyst, RhB and water before irradiation.  Irradiation of the solution was 
performed under UV light at wavelength of 254 nm.  Quantitative analysis of RhB was performed 
using UV-vis at the maximum absorption wavelength 553 nm. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3-1 Binding mechanisms 
To examine the binding of salicylic acid on the surface of TiO2, the functional groups of the 
samples were analyzed using FTIR.  Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of salicylic acid, P25, and 
modified TiO2.  After microwave irradiation, the TiO2 exhibited -COO- and C=C stretching 
absorptions at 1120-1700 cm-1, indicating the existence of salicylic acid on the surface of TiO2.  The 
absorption bands of P25 at 1600 cm-1 and 3300-3740 cm-1 are attributed to bending and stretching of 
OH, respectively.  However, the intensity of the OH bands decreased after modification.  This 
result reveals that the salicylic acid bonds to TiO2 via dehydration.  The modified samples exhibited 
the -C=O absorption centered at 1657 cm-1, indicating the formation of ester structure.  Therefore, 
salicylic acid is mainly covalently bonded to the TiO2 by condensation of its -COOH with Ti-OH 
under microwave assisted acidic catalysis.  In addition, salicylic acid could be bound to TiO2 through 
complexation and hydrogen bonding. Figure 3 illustrates the adsorption mechanisms of salicylic acid.  
It is noted that heat treatment of the as-prepared samples at 180 °C reduces the mass of the samples 
and turns their color from light yellow to dark yellow.  This phenomenon indicates that substantial

3-2 Band gaps, microstructures, and surface compositions 
After surface modification, the C/Ti ratio of the ST0593 was 14.5.  This value was much higher 
than that of P25 (3.41), indicating that substantial amounts of salicylic acid is bounded on the TiO2 
surface.  In addition, theoretical C/Ti ratio that one salicylic acid binds one Ti4+ ion is 7.00.  The 
higher C/Ti ratio obtained in this study reveals that half contents of surface salicylic acid are bound in 
terms of hydrogen bonding.

3-3 Photocatalysis 
3-3-1 The comparison between P25 and ST0593 
Figure 7 shows the photocatalytic degradation of RhB by P25 or ST0593.  The de-coloration of 
RhB in the P25-based system mainly followed pseudo-first order kinetics.  It is noted that a lag on 
the photocatalytic de-coloration took place in the first 10 min.  This phenomenon is attributed to 
competitive decomposition of physisorbed salicylic acid.  Pseudo-first order kinetics was followed 
after 10 min.  Table 3 lists the rate constant of P25 and ST0593.  The ST0593 performed higher rate 
constant (4.6 ×10-2 1/min) than P25 (2.8 × 10-2 1/min).  This result demonstrates that surface 
modification with salicylic acid promotes the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.  Such benefits are 
contributed from the special affinity of salicylic acid toward the RhB by π-π interaction which 
promotes the mass diffusion in the solutions.

photocatalysis. The modified TiO2 treated by microwave results in esterization, complexation and 
hydrogen bonding with salicylic acid.  While esterized modifiers enhance adsorption of RhB onto 
the surface of photocatalysts, the complexed and hydrogen-bonded modifiers play as roles of electron 
and hole scavengers, respectively.  Therefore, the improved mass diffusion and interfacial charge 
transfer results in a synergetic effects on high photocatalytic activity.

3-3-3 Effects of different parameters on the photocatalytic efficiency 
Figure 9 shows the influence of different parameters on the photocatalytic activities.    From 
this histogram, we can find the optimal TiO2-Organic molar ratio was 1/0.5 (k = 4.6 × 10-2 1/min).  
The photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant by modified TiO2 involves partition, diffusion and 
surface reaction.  Over amounts of salicylic acid limit kinetic rate for removal of RhB because of 
competitive degradation of the modifier.  In addition, the salicylic acid would block the UV-light for 
activating TiO2.  On the other hand, insufficient quantity of salicylic acid has less contribution on 
adsorption and interfacial charger transfer, and consequently results in low photocatalytic activity.
