1. Introduction 
ZrO2 has been used in many industrial areas due to its superior properties such as 
anti-oxidation [1-3], thermal stability [4-6], high refractive index [6-9], and high corrosion 
resistance [10-16].  ZrO2 coatings are considered to be utilized as a corrosion barrier in 
aggressive environment, where the corrosion resistance of the coating is related to packing 
density and major phases [10,11,17,18].  The high mechanical strength and fracture 
toughness accompanying with hydrophobic nature [19-21] enable ZrO2 coating to be used as 
the protective layer on cutting tools and biomedical materials [22,23].  Moreover, the high 
ionic conductivity of doped ZrO2 can be applied in fuel cells [24,25] and oxygen sensors 
[26].   
Under ambient pressure, ZrO2 has three polymorphs: Monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) is a 
stable phase below 1205C, tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) presents between 1205C ~2377C, and 
cubic ZrO2 (c-ZrO2) exists above 2377C, and the melting point of ZrO2 is 2710C [27].  
The stability of ZrO2 polymorphs is related to the oxygen vacancy concentration, and the 
phase transformation from m-ZrO2 to t-ZrO2 then c- ZrO2 is in accord with increasing oxygen 
vacancy concentration [28-36].  The stabilization for high temperature polymorphs of ZrO2 
(t-ZrO2 and c-ZrO2) is usually by adding metal oxide (MgO, CaO or Y2O3) into ZrO2, where 
the bivalent (Mg2+ and Ca2+) [37,38] or trivalent (Y3+) cations [31] will replace Zr4+ on the 
sublattice, or doping nitrogen into ZrO2 [28,39-44], by which O2- on the sublattice can be 
substituted by N3- and oxygen vacancies should be created to maintain the charge neutrality.  
However, oxynitride phases such as Zr2ON2, instead of high temperature polymorphs, may 
form in N-doped ZrO2 [28,44-48], if oxygen vacancies are uniformly distributed [28,47,48].  
Therefore, yttrium is doped in ZrO2 before doping N to disturb the distribution of oxygen 
vacancies and thereby preventing the formation of oxynitrides [28,48].  For N-doped ZrO2, 
ZrN may precipitate as oxygen vacancy concentration exceeds the tolerance for c- ZrO2 [28, 
4 
 
UBMS were delaminated during corrosion test, which was mainly due to poor adhesion of 
the coating by the formation of an oxygen-rich layer nearby the film/substrate interface [52].  
Hasuyama et al. [14] also reported that the corrosion resistance is closely related to film 
adhesion.  The results suggested that using HCD-IP method may solve the delamination 
problem occurred in the specimens deposited by UBMS.  
In this study, the ZrO2(N) thin films were prepared by HCD-IP on AISI 304 stainless 
steel.  The objectives of the present study are to investigate the phase transition of ZrO2 thin 
film with increasing nitrogen content and to provide a feasible approach to manufacture 
ZrO2(N) coatings with excellent corrosion resistance and good adhesion. 
ZrNxOy thin films in our previous studies [10,54,56,62] were produced using HCD-IP by 
maintaining constant N2 flow rate and increasing O2 flow rate from 0 to 10 sccm.  The 
nitrogen content in the thin films is ranged from 20 at% to 42 at%; in other words, the 
ZrNxOy thin films contained mainly ZrN phase or ZrO2 with very high nitrogen contents.  
To study the phase transition and properties of thin films with ZrO2 as the major phase, the 
deposition processing should be changed to maintain O2 at constant flow rate and 
progressively increase N2 flow rate such that nitrogen content can be lower than 20 at%.  
2. Experimental details 
ZrO2(N) thin films were prepared using an HCD-IP system.  The substrate material was 
AISI 304 stainless steel with dimensions of 14 × 14 × 0.8 mm3.  Before deposition, the 
substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol, each for 5 min.  Then the 
substrates were blown dried with N2 gas and immediately placed into the deposition chamber.   
The base pressure of the deposition chamber was 8 × 10-4 Pa (6 × 10-6 Torr) to reduce 
the contamination during the coating process.  Before deposition, the substrate was 
bombarded by Ar ions for 10 min.  The flow rates of working gas Ar and reactive gas O2 
were 10.4 and 10 sccm, respectively for depositing ZrO2 thin film.  The electron gun power 
6 
 
integrated intensity of the element i.  The uncertainty of the composition is about 5%.     
The integrated intensities of ZrO2, ZrN and ZrNO peaks from the deconvoluted Zr-3d spectra 
are used to determine bonding fraction.  The binding energies of ZrO2, ZrN and ZrNO are 
summarized in Table 1. 
The atomic compositions of the samples were also determined by Rutherford 
backscattering spectroscopy (RBS).  α (4He+) particle with energy of 2 MeV was used as 
the incident ion species.  The spectra of RBS were fitted using the RUMP simulation 
program. Owing to the overlapping signals of N and O, the Zr/N/O ratio cannot be acquired 
from the RBS spectra; therefore only (N+O)/Zr ratios could be reported from RBS analysis.  
The simulated atomic density, SAD (1015 #/cm2) can be obtained from the RBS data, and the 
film packing density (#/cm3) was calculate as 
5SAD 10 (RBS)D = 
t
 , where D is the 
packing density of thin films (#/cm3), and t is the film thickness obtained by AES depth 
profiles. 
The compositional depth profiles of the films were determined by Auger electron 
spectroscopy (AES).  Since the sputtering yield of each element is different, the atomic 
fraction of the element in the compositional depth profiles is calibrated by XPS data.  The 
compositional depth profiles of the specimens were used to examine the uniformity of 
compositions in the thin films.  The film thickness of the film on stainless steel was also 
measured using AES depth profiles.  The sputtering time was correlated to the film 
thickness by carrying out AES measurement on a ZrO2(N) thin film deposited on Si wafer in 
the same batch, where the film thickness was measured from the cross-sectional image of 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The uncertainty of the thickness measurement is about 
the same as the resolution of SEM image, which is 5 nm.   
The crystal structure and preferred orientation were characterized by X-ray diffraction 
8 
 
ASTM standard B117 and G85 were adopted as the specifications for the salt spray test [70].  
After the salt spray test, the percentage of pitting area was examined by counting number of 
pits using a grid paper in eight pictures taken by optical microscopy at 200X for each 
specimen.  The percentage of pitting area is closely correlated with corrosion resistance.  In 
addition, the extent of color change on the specimen surface is also related to its corrosion 
resistance. 
3. Results 
3.1 Chemical Analysis 
    The contents of N and Zr progressively increase while O content decreases with 
increasing nitrogen flow rate in SSAD-series specimens, as shown in Fig. 1.  Slight 
deviations, compared with the general trend in AD-specimens, are found in HT-series 
samples.  The nitrogen content increases progressively from 3.0 at% to 13.0 at% and then 
decreases to 6.0 at% and 10.0 at%.  The sample SS12HT contains high nitrogen content up 
to 25.7 at%.  However, XPS cannot actually represent the average compositions in specimen 
because the detecting depth of XPS is only 10 nm that is less than 1.5 % of the film thickness.  
Therefore the compositional depth profiles by AES were used to examine the uniformity of 
compositions in the thin films, and the results will be presented later.  
    The bonding fractions of the thin films derived from XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2.  
For as-deposited films, the ZrO2 bonding progressively decreases, and the ZrN bonding 
gradually increases with increasing nitrogen flow rate.  In contrast, the SSHT-series 
specimens show a different trend in ZrN bonding, where ZrN increases for specimens 
SS00HT to SS04HT, decreases for specimens SS06HT and SS09HT, and then significantly 
increases again for SS12HT.  The variation of ZrN bonding in Zr-3d spectra is consistent 
with that of nitrogen content shown in Fig. 1. 
10 
 
m-ZrO2, c-ZrO2 and ZrN.  For the as-deposited sample SS00AD, m-ZrO2 is predominant in 
thin film with minor c-ZrO2 phase.  As nitrogen flow rate increases to 2 sccm, the intensity 
of m-ZrO2 ( 111 ) significantly decreases.  ZrN (111) peak appears in the ZrO2(N) thin films 
in the specimens SS04AD.  The peaks of ZrN phase become more distinct and stronger as 
the nitrogen flow rate reaches 6 sccm and above.           
    Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns for the annealed specimens.  In the SSHT-series 
specimens, no new phase appears after annealing; the annealed thin films consist of m-ZrO2, 
c-ZrO2 and ZrN, but with different phase ratios.  Compared with the as-deposited specimens, 
m-ZrO2 obviously decreases in specimens SSHT00, SSHT02 and SSHT04, and disappears in 
samples SSHT06, SSHT09 and SSHT12.  c-ZrO2 becomes distinct for specimens SSHT00, 
SSHT02, SSHT04 and SSHT06, and ZrN peaks gradually appear and become dominant for 
specimens SSHT09 and SSHT12.   
Fig. 7 depicts the phase ratio with respect to nitrogen flow rate for the as-deposited and 
heat-treated specimens.  The figure shows that the ratio of m-ZrO2 decreases, while ZrN 
increases, and c-ZrO2 first increases then decreases with increasing nitrogen flow rate.  
After heat treatment, the ratio of m-ZrO2 decreases while the ratios of c-ZrO2 and ZrN 
increase compared with the corresponding phase ratios in the as-deposited specimens.    
3.3 Residual Stress 
   The residual stress of each phase in thin film with respect to nitrogen flow rate is shown 
in Fig. 8.  The residual stress in each phase is compressive for the all as-deposited samples.  
It is found that the residual stress of m-ZrO2 first increases and then decreases to -6.7 GP for 
specimens SS00AD, SS02AD and SS04AD.  The residual stress of c-ZrO2 decreases from 
-11.0 GPa to -7.9 GPa and then increases to -9.7 GPa; subsequently, the stress of c-ZrO2 
decreases from -9.7 GPa to -4.8 GPa.  The stress of ZrN first decreases from -10.0 GPa to 
-8.8 GPa and then increases to -10.7 GPa.   
12 
 
The data of 500-hr salt spray test and are tabulated in Table 3.  The results show that the 
ZrO2(N) thin films have excellent corrosion resistance and durability, and the percentage of 
corrosion area is very low, ranging from 0.10% to 0.66%. 
4. Discussion 
4.1 Phase Transitions 
From XRD patterns, there are three phases in the as-deposited thin films including 
m-ZrO2, c-ZrO2 and ZrN.  In fact, the diffraction peaks of t-ZrO2 are very close to those of 
c-ZrO2, and hence it is very difficult to distinguish those two phases.  From JCPDS data 
[72,73], t-ZrO2 has doublet diffraction peaks at some diffraction angles with a difference in 
2 about 1º owing to a/c ratio derived from tetragonal structure, while c-ZrO2 does not have 
doublet peaks.  Previous study showed that the doublet diffraction peaks have not been 
found for c-ZrO2(N) using synchrotron X-ray [53].  In this work, since the doublet 
diffraction peaks are not observed in XRD patterns, the possibility of c-ZrO2 is much higher 
than t-ZrO2.   
It was suggested that the key to stabilize high temperature polymorphs, t-ZrO2 and 
c-ZrO2, is the formation of oxygen vacancies [29].  Introducing nitrogen in ZrO2 may lead 
to the replacement of oxygen atoms by nitrogen atoms, thereby generating oxygen vacancies 
[28], which plays a crucial role in stabilizing high temperature polymorphs of ZrO2.  As 
oxygen vacancy concentration increases, m-ZrO2 will transform to t-ZrO2 and subsequently 
to c-ZrO2; the extent of the transformation is determined by the oxygen concentration 
[28,29,30,35].  Higher oxygen vacancy concentration implies more substitutional nitrogen 
atoms (Nsub) dissolving in the compound, and hence m-ZrO2 can be regarded as a phase with 
lower solution nitrogen while c-ZrO2 as a phase with higher nitrogen.  However, high 
oxygen vacancy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the stabilization of c-ZrO2, 
because the increase of nitrogen content may also facilitate the formation ordered zirconium 
14 
 
oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 would destabilize c-ZrO2 where Nsub atoms should be expelled to 
maintain charge neutrality.  As a result, the c-ZrO2 lattice can no longer be maintained, and 
phase separation of ZrN from c-ZrO2 becomes a way that simultaneously decreasing oxygen 
vacancies and Nsub can be satisfied.  This is consistent with the results that ZrN phase ratio 
increases for the samples SS04HT to SS12HT.   
The phase transition and oxygen vacancy annihilation may be related to the 
compositional fluctuation revealed by AES depth profiles for samples SS06HT to SS12HT 
(Figs. 3(b,c)).  These samples show diffusion of N and O atoms in the ZrO2(N) thin films, 
which can be attributed to the excellent conductivity of c-ZrO2 [71] and high oxygen vacancy 
concentration in SSAD-specimens, and consequently diffusion can occur in bulk or along 
grain boundaries during annealing [75].  The fast diffusion could lead to the formation of a 
golden ZrN layer on thin film surface of the samples SS09HT and SS12HT.   
Compared with our previous study [56] where the ZrNxOy thin films were deposited on 
Si and Zr2ON2 phase was observed after heat treatment at 700 and 900C, in this study only 
c-ZrO2 phase was found after heat treatment even for the specimens with nitrogen content as 
high as 25.7 at% (SS12HT).  As mentioned, if the nitrogen content is uniformly distributed, 
the formation of Zr2ON2 may be facilitated [28,52], while nonuniformly distributed nitrogen 
atoms may stabilize the high temperature ZrO2 polymorphs.  The fluctuation in 
compositions for the annealed specimens (Figs. 3(b,c)) can account for the existence of 
c-ZrO2 instead of Zr2ON2.  However, the effect of substrate material on the phase transition 
of Zr-N-O compound is not well-understood and need further research.  
4.2 Adhesion and Surface Energy 
    The ZrO2(N) thin films deposited by HCD-IP remained intact after salt spray test and 
potentiodynamic polarization scan; by contrast, the ZrNxOy thin films on stainless steel 
substrate by magnetron sputtering were delaminated after salt spray test [52].  Obviously, 
16 
 
results show that packing density and m-ZrO2 phase ratio are the two important factors.  Icorr 
with respect to packing density is displayed in Fig. 10(a), where the specimens can be divided 
into two groups according nitrogen contents; Group I represents ZrO2 thin films with lower 
nitrogen content (specimens 00, 02, and 04), and Group II indicates that ZrO2(N) thin films 
contain higher N content and proper amount of ZrN, ranging from 14.4 ~ 28.8% (specimens 
06, 09 and 12).  The Group II specimens, both as-deposited (AD-II) and heat-treated (HT-II) 
samples, show that Icorr decreases with increasing packing density.  However, the Group I 
specimens, as-deposited (AD-I) and heat-treated (HT-I) samples, present the opposite trend, 
implying that another factor instead of packing density may affect the corrosion resistance.  
Qin et al. [18] reported that cracks usually initiate at low-strength m-ZrO2 subjecting to 
compressive stress, and theses cracks act as fast penetration paths for the corrosive medium, 
leading to corrosion of substrate material.  Hence, under high compressive stress (Fig. 8), 
m-ZrO2 phase ratio is an important factor in corrosion resistance.  Icorr with respect to 
m-ZrO2 phase ratio is depicted in Fig. 10(b), where both AD-I and HT-I specimens show that 
Icorr increases with m-ZrO2 phase ratio.  Compared with AD-I specimens, the corrosion 
resistance of HT-I specimens is obviously improved by annealing, which can be attributed to 
the decrease in m-ZrO2 phase and the relief of compressive stress (Fig. 8). 
For the Group II specimens, the effect of m-ZrO2 phase ratio on Icorr is not obvious, and 
therefore corrosion resistance is mainly affected by packing density.  In addition, AD-II 
specimens show better corrosion resistance than AD-I specimens, indicating that proper 
amount of ZrN, ranging from 14.4~28.8%, incorporated in ZrO2(N) may improve corrosion 
resistance.  However, too much ZrN phase may decrease the corrosion resistance.  The 
annealed samples SS06HT and SS09HT maintain high corrosion resistance, while specimen 
SS12HT shows higher Icorr regardless of higher packing density than specimen SS12AD, 
which is attributed to the incorporation of large amount of ZrN phase.  This is consistent 
18 
 
corrosion area for the HT-I specimens is still related to the packing density; again, the 
corrosion area becomes more sensitive to packing density.  Moreover, after annealing, the 
specimen SS06HT remains great corrosion resistance (Figs. 5.10 and 5.11) and excellent 
durability (Fig. 12).  In contrast, the sample SS09HT with similar packing density as sample 
SS06HT displays higher corrosion area (Fig. 12).  The specimens SS09HT and SS12HT 
show the worst durability in salt spray test, which may be due to a ZrN layer forming on the 
thin film surface.  As mentioned, ZrN phase has lower durability under the attack of Cl- 
owing to lower chemical inertness [10], which is consistent with the results for the samples 
SS09HT and SS12HT. 
5. Conclusions 
The ZrO2(N) thin films were successfully deposited on 304 stainless steel substrates 
using HCD-IP.  For SSAD-series specimens, as nitrogen content increases the phase content 
of c-ZrO2 increases while that of m-ZrO2 decreases, and then ZrN precipitates and increases.  
After heat treatment, phase separation of ZrN from c-ZrO2 occurs in SSHT-series specimens 
containing higher nitrogen content.  The HCD-IP method can effectively overcome the 
adhesion problem of ZrO2 on stainless steel, and the ZrO2(N) coatings possess excellent 
adhesion and corrosion resistance on stainless steel.  The corrosion resistance of ZrO2(N) 
thin films for potentiodynamic scan in 1N H2SO4 is related to packing density and m-ZrO2 
phase ratio.  For potentiodynamic scan in 5% NaCl and salt spray test, packing density is the 
main factor on the corrosion resistance of the films.  The ZrO2(N) thin films incorporated 
with proper amount of ZrN, ranging from 14.4% to 28.8%, show higher corrosion resistance 
than those without ZrN.
